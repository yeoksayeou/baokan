<p>遵守諾言避作妨碍行動購銀程序力求出諸審慎</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間某高級專家今日表示、中國最近幣制政策最可注意之一點、卽爲在實際上已附從日益擴大之英鎊區域、此間雖承認華幣並非直接與英鎊聯屬、惟信中國在新制度下、惟一可以維持匯兌平衡之有效地點、卽爲倫敦、故華幣自當歸入英鎊勢力之下云、財部方面對於中國之幣制新政、不願批評、惟表示此事之取决、與美國並無關係、國務院方面亦不願標示是否將勸令在華美僑與中國政府合作、惟觀察者信、國務院至少將間接合作云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間負責方面今日表示、美國將來之購銀政策、擬以竭力避免妨害中國政府最近穩定幣價之方法出之、並表明此係繼續遵守以前美國對華之諾言、惟目前中國對於幣價已、有較强之控制、故此項諾言、益見重要云、財政專家解釋政府之態度、謂此係表示美國至少在國會來年一月開會、銀派議員返此之前、將維持銀價比較穩定之地位、一般人皆以爲最近數月來美國之購銀程序、非常審愼、亦爲鼓勵中國採取其最近步驟之一種根本成份、茲中國方着手改革幣制、美國自不願擾亂世界銀價、國會中銀派議員現已意見紛岐、且大半不在首都、故政府一，切設施、更無阻碍云、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於中國幣制改革問題、頃據財政部發言人宣稱、中國政府所採貨幣措置、如創辦中央準備銀行之類、雖與英國財部顧問羅斯爵士之建議、頗相符合、要係出自中國政府之創意、此舉實由中國政府爲財政及貨幣方面之形勢所迫、故不得不然、至於中國貨幣所定匯率、則絕非由於羅斯爵士之所建議云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（舊金山）美國參院膨脹派領袖湯默斯今日聲稱、中國脫離銀本位之理由、恰如美國脫離金本位蓋中國政府見銀價高翔、故决定將銀收歸國有、以其利益分諸公衆、而不任令投機家獨享云、湯氏曾宣布、彼現信美國亦宜採取通貨管理之計劃、並謂世界各國除法國等三數歐洲國家外、現在皆取管理通貨制度、故彼以中國之舉動、實爲世界通貨穩定之最後一步、惟穩定之期尙不在目前耳、湯氏希望世界通貨穩定之後、卽能採取金銀複本位制、現在中國政府之能否獲利、雖全恃將來之銀價如何、惟彼深信中國定能獲利、美國則固欲提高銀價、亦有力量可以支配銀價、現在世界存銀數額約有一百萬萬盎斯、共中美國佔十二萬萬、印度四十五萬萬、中國二十五萬萬、若銀價高升、中美兩國卽有利益、且美國儘有餘力、可以吸收全世界之金銀云、湯氏復言及美國之購銀政策、謂財部尙須購進十萬萬盎斯、始足金三銀一之比、茲中國以白銀收歸國有、史見世界銀價復將上升、中國於白銀國有之前、其國內之實　家及銀行家皆不願銀價上升、因其製造成本將因之增加、而其債務抵押品之價値、則將因之低落、惟通貨管理實行之後、中國政府卽將控制其國內幣價、而免受外人控制之苦矣、至於國際通或戰爭之前途、湯氏以　大多數國家實行通貨管理之後、此事或將不免、有人復詢湯氏對於參議員畢德門所稱銀價將於十八個月以內達到一元二角九分之意見、湯氏謂不必十八個月、如銀價能達此高度、則當在美國下屈大選之前、如政府不能於大選之前順從民意、抬高銀價、則以後更不致實行云（四日國民電）</p>
<p>黑諾　銀派領袖畢德門今日吿記者、謂中國收白銀爲國有、由於十八個月內每盎斯銀價將漲至一元二角九分、記者問其對於中國政府銀政策之感想、畢氏答稱、中國此舉自屬事理之常、如君屯積每盎斯値六角五分之貨物、短時期內將漲至一元二角九分、則君非漲至該價以後必不願拋售也、並稱、中國僅有兩途可循、取消白銀出口稅恢復市塲之自由、或收白銀爲國有、中國現取後者、蓋因世界銀價提高則私販愈活動、勢非至白銀流盡不止也畢氏復稱、中國政府此舉對於美國之銀政策並無影響云（五日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">希臘復辟運動之成熟 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>十九世紀希臘獨立運動領袖谷樂谷特龍尼斯將軍嘗謂。「希臘無君不足以自存。」當今希臘名政治家柏立第斯爲一九二四年日內瓦議定書起草人之一。現任駐法公使。最近又任意阿調解委員會之仲裁員。彼在雅典報章上發表意見。亦謂。「君主立憲遠勝於民主專制。」可知希臘民族之傾向帝制旣深且久。此次復辟運動在統治階級。固早有周妥之布置者。三日在軍人統制下舉行之全民投票。無非形式上之舉動而已。據最近電訊。總投票結果。贊成恢復帝制者。以一、五〇一、九九二票對三三、三六〇票。佔絕大多數。誠意中事也。</p>
<p>希臘共和。宣布於一九二五年五月一日。此次革命。實爲對士戰敗之結果。蓋歐戰後。希臘挾英法恊約軍爲奧援。圖兼併垂涎已久之斯美那。因土耳其民族英雄基瑪爾之奮勇抗戰。卒在小亞細亞大敗。其後國內政變。接踵以起。國君康斯敦丁遂於一九二三年一月十一日二次退位。喬治二世繼位未久。卽於同年十二月十七日爲國會所廢。一九二五年三月二十五日。國會通過推翻帝制。建立共和。四月十三日。國民總投票。以七五八、七四二票對三二五、三二二票核准。五月一日正式宣布改制。迄今纔十有半載耳。</p>
<p>希臘政黨大者有三。卽共和黨帝制黨。及社會共產黨是。共和黨以望依瑞樂斯爲領袖。以特利第島爲大本營。望氏爲希臘近代大政治家之一。指導希臘國事凡二十年。現在主張復辟最力之貢第利斯初亦隸共和黨。帝制黨有極端派與穩健派之分。前任總理蔡達利斯則爲穩健派之頜袖。共和黨在海陸軍中亦有相當勢力。目擊帝制傾向日趨於變本加厲。曾於今年三月一日聯絡社會共產黨人舉兵起事。爲共和政體作最後之擁護。惟僅如曇花一現。而望依瑞樂斯以衰慕之年。亡命巴黎矣。此後貢第利斯頗欲一舉而復王政。惟蔡達利斯身爲總理。對於國體更易。自不願草率從事。喬治二世對於自身出處亦頗愼重。是以雖經七月十九日及十月十日之二次政潮。貢第利斯仍不得不將此關係重大之政制問題。取决於人民公意。今者總投票結果如此。帝制派可如願以償矣。</p>
<p>雖然此六百六十萬人口之蕞爾小國。近百年來。其君主被黜與被弒之事。據史乘所載。已有數起。自一九二四年帝制傾覆。以至於今。黨爭之烈。亦復報不絕書。可見無論爲帝制爲民治。在希臘均難長治久安。况望依瑞樂斯派之勢力尙有餘勇可賈。而現居倫敦之喬治二世。卽帝制派中人。對其歸政亦不無携貳者乎。</p>

<p>— 張鐵生</p>
<p>意國黑衣宰相墨索里尼曾作獅子吼：「寗願做一天的獅子，不願做一百年的綿羊。」因此他就不顧一切，拼命向非洲『冒險，』表面上是引『開化黑種國』為己任，但實際上則『欲夷阿國為意國的摩洛哥。』這樣他不僅可使三百萬意人移居非洲，並且可使意人開化黑人的工作至少延長到五十年。</p>
<p>英人想制裁意人麼？『制裁的意義就是戰爭，『這是加達的回答。英人想封鎖蘇彝士運河麽？『意國决在海陸空以全力來抵抗他們，』這是墨索里尼的回答。最近意國內閣在波爾沙諾所舉行的會議，也是同樣的態度。</p>
<p>意國當局對於意阿戰爭的態度，我們即此巳可窺見一斑了，然則意國民衆的態度又怎樣呢？這却是我們也要注意的一個問題。自然，這個問題我們在意國報紙上是不能找到實在的答案。</p>
<p>無論什麼人，他苟在意國勾留一下，就可到處發見意人極關心的問題便是『阿比西尼亞戰爭。』他們大多數表示不贊成戰爭。他們抱着厭惡戰爭的觀念，有許多人甚至認為這是自殺。但是公開的反對是沒有的，因為法西斯蒂十三年的獨栽政權巳以顯然或隱然的恐怖政策使他們不敢反對了。</p>
<p>當然，國家主義在意人中並不是沒有作用。可是抱國家主義的人，他們以為要攫得『太陽下面的一個地方，』除戰爭外還有別的方法。就在法西斯蒂的黨裏面，也是有人批評的，他們為謹愼起見，固然是不敢公開批評，然而腹議或變相的批評却不免形之於色。有許多資本家開頭對於瘋狂備戰的情形還抱着幾分妄想，但自從墨索里尼在波爾沙諾閱兵時，宣布要抽他們的重稅以後，他們却把一團高興冷到了零度。中產階級的上層也疾首蹙額甚至於憤恨，但無可如何。他們一向所以帮助法西斯蒂的緣故，只因為這是抵制共產主義的惟一救星，但是現在的苛捐雜稅，橫徵暴歛，以及營業的蕭條，來日的黯淡，却使他們失了望。不過他們却非繼續帮助不可，因為他們知道現政府如坍了臺，立刻就會變成無政府的局面，甚至也會變成共產黨的天下。他們所最担心的是，意國同阿國的戰爭萬一失敗，則法西斯蒂難免解體；可是解體後的後惠就不堪設想了。</p>
<p>曾有一個法西斯蒂是這樣的說：『靑年人是一心一意的法西斯蒂。他們並不知道別的事情，但是我巳過了五十歲，我是一僩法西斯蒂，又完全是一個國家主義者；可是我們老年人却不慣於法西斯在事業上所造成的危險，我不知道我老的時候我同我的家庭是怎樣。』由此可知墨索果尼的吼聲：『冒險，」甚至是不能煽動他的一定年紀以上的信徒。那些曾經帮助他奪取政權的人，他們大都是渴想過一過『幸福的晚年，』而不願繼續拼命冒險。在意國北部及南部的工人中，有大半是决沒有收　於法西斯之下。即法西斯蒂工聯中的會員也不一定就贊成法西斯蒂的政權，他們不過是為經濟所迫勉强加入，所以他們對於意阿戰爭的態度是可想而知的。可是墨索里尼對於他們也許分外注意，因為他從前也曾做過一個社會主義者，他很知道工人的重要，而不能讓他們變成亡命之徒。他儘管是這樣想，無如工人們却决不喜歡法西斯，其在表面上表示贊成的工人，不過是為的自己的工作而巳。尤其是曾參加過第一次世界大戰或其牠戰事的工人，他們都格外是主張和平。甚至也有公然反對戰爭的。</p>
<p>不僅意國的工人是這樣，甚至羅馬總參謀部也曾反對向阿國冒險，這在現在巳成了一種公開的秘密。以當兵為職業的軍隊，他們就經濟財政以及實際上的其他方面着想，也以為這種冒險乃是一筆極拋空盤的買賣。其巳開往非洲的軍隊之口出怨言，固不必說，即尙未開拔的軍隊也覺得前途黑暗，至於想避免軍役的消息我們更是時常聽見。</p>
<p>即以身居高位的法西斯蒂而論，也有幾個人開始就反對冒險。不過總參謀部雖也反對，但是他們都是軍人出身，祇知道服從，他們明知這種冒險無異於一種賭博，可是他們却非贊成不可。關於意皇的態度，風傳也反對戰爭。不過墨索里尼的手段畢竟高强，他不欲獨担戰事的責任，同時他在一切戰事的企圖上且使皇室分担其責任，因為他極力是使皇室中的許多份子居於戰事的領袖地位，這樣，一旦即有不測，他是很可把罪過推在他們身上的。</p>
<p>我在上面巳經說過，意人對於意阿戰爭之公開的反對是沒有的。他們如談到這個問題，都是十分謹愼而小心，恐遭禍事。他們甚至是不願同一個外國人討論這個問題，怕他是法西斯蒂的一個偵探。某國報紙訪員曾在米蘭聽見三個中年商人談到戰事，他們因為物價巳提得太高，並且還要漲價的綠故，都反對戰爭。就連日常的商品也難銷售，更不談意國北部仍在大批製造的奢侈品。無論是薪水或工資，都是不斷的大减特减，意人購買力旣减低，而同時捐稅又提高，一般商業之不振乃是自然的結果。並且意人現在是公開的反對漲價。一個法西斯蒂曾在一個熱天想買一個橘子，而賣橘者就索價兩里拉；『這是賣給英國人而不是賣給意國人的一種價錢，」他憤怒着說。</p>
<p>意國許多鄉村裏反對戰爭的態度，因為政府壓制的綠故，多半是僅能用粉筆寫在街道兩邊的墻上。在威尼斯及蓋諾阿的狹巷裏，在那不勒斯的小街上，墻上是寫滿了反對戰爭的標語。法西斯蒂擁護戰爭的標語，立刻就為人塗去。</p>
<p>可是法西斯蒂十三年的恐怖政策終究剷除了一切公開的反對。無論意人在墻上是寫的什麽，但這在實際上無濟於事。墨索里尼之所以能悍然不顧一切而為所欲為，即由於此。他不僅是巳在十三年中為所欲為，並且他還想繼續下去，同時他也覺得能够這樣，因為他現在顯然還是意國的一個統治者。至於因意阿戰爭而起的未來的隱患，他還沒有十分放在心上。</p>
<p>現在意國任何反對戰爭的表示，固然是無力，墨索里尼現在固然是有一心一意的靑年做他的後盾，（因為他們都是在十三年中飽受了法西斯蒂的敎育，而不知道別的事情，）可是意阿戰爭這筆投機的買賣，不僅是在國內預伏着未來的隱患，就在國外也樹了勢不相下的大敵。（十月二日寄）</p>

<p>（十月廿九卅一兩日對全國中等學校學生講）</p>
<p>中央大學敎授錢端升</p>
<p>「靑年是國家未來的主人翁」這句話不但在尊重讀書人的中國常被人們用做勉勵止在護書的靑年的一種措詞，在別的國家，靑年也都是被人家這樣恭維的。在十九世紀時，意大利有一極有名的志士呌做馬志尼。他是少年意大利運動的創始人，是統一意大利的最大功臣，也是古今中外的模範靑年。他是意大利三傑之一，而且也是二傑中之最傑出者。記得他於喚起散居於歐洲各國的意大利靑年時，曾有過這樣的一句話。</p>
<p>如果靑年是任何國家未來的主人翁，則靑年尤其是中國未來的主人翁。中國一般的國民是沒有受過敎育的，而靑年則正在受新式的敎育。當此國難萬分嚴重的關頭，智識比一般高的靑年，對於國家自然担負着較大的任務。為準備將來担負其所應擔負的任務起見，靑年第一應認識國家，第二應求做一個好國民。</p>
<p>（一）要認識我們的國家</p>
<p>靑年對於國家自然應有濃厚的愛國心。我們中國國勢之所以及不上世界上其他的大國，固然有種種不同的原因，但國民愛國心的薄弱，可說是最大也是最根本的原因。為什麼我國國民的愛國心極薄弱呢？因為國民的國家觀念太薄弱。國民的大部份都未受過敎育他們不知國家是什麽東西，於是他們對於國家也自然沒有什麽感情可言。所以要愛國先要知道國家的一切情形。</p>
<p>政治學家認為國家由三種原素構成，這三種原素就是人民，土地，與主權。人民土地是物質的原素，主權可說是續神的原素。</p>
<p>人民就是人羣。一個國家必定要有個人羣，沒有人羣，當然不能有國家，這是顯而易見的道理。</p>
<p>但只有人羣而沒有土地，國家也是不能成立的。同時這所謂土地而且要是一定的。古　遊牧的民族是不能成立國家的，因為他們沒有一定的土地。沒有一定的土地，便不能有政府，沒有政府即不能維持主權。</p>
<p>那末主權又是什麽東西呢？主權又稱統治權是國民處理國土以內，一切的公共事務之權為管理國土以內的公共事務起見，國民便得設立一個政府。如果國民的統治權是完全無缺的，這政府也是一定最高無上的，除了本國國民以外，別個的人民不能過問。如果人民的統治權不完全，譬如說，甲國（姑稱之為國）對於外交權不能自主，須得乙國的同意，那末甲國的政府便不是一個獨立的政府，甲國人民的管理權便不是完全無缺的主權，而甲國也不成為一個國家。</p>
<p>國家不能離開主權而生存的理由是很淺顯的。一個省有省的人民，省的土地，與省的政府。一個市也有市的人民，市的土地，與市的政府。國家與省市不同的地方，就是國家的政府的權力是最高無上的，而省市政府則須受中央政府的管轄。換一句話，國是獨立的，而省市是不獨立的；獨立的有主權，不獨立的沒有主權，如果一羣人民，有了土地，有了政府，或者一個地方有了人民，有了政府，便算成立了國家，那未一省一市豈不也成立了國家嗎？再小一點一鄉一村也不算是國家嗎？那當然是不對的。所以政治學者堅持以主權為國家的三原索之一，僅有人民與土地兩種物質的原素不能成為國家；一定要兼有了主權，才能成為國家。</p>
<p>我們中國是一個獨立國家我們中國當然也有人民，土地·及主權三個原素·那末我們的人民，土地，及生權又怎樣呢？這是靑年們所最應熟知的事項。要熟知這些事項，要知道這三方面所有的長處及短處；才能眞正愛國。只知長處而不知短處，則容易成為一種虛驕，只知短處而不知長處，則容易氣餒，甚或會覺得我們國家不可愛。</p>
<p>我們先講中國的人民。中國的人民有許多的優點，但是也有許多的弱點。第一個優點是我們的國家差不多是一個民族國家。民族與國民不同。國民是一個的人民，民族是一種人民的結合，這結合以血統，語言，宗敎，風俗，習慣，及歷史為基礎。一國的人民，其血統、語言，等等　可完全不同，但同一民族的份于，則其血統，語言等等。大體上一定相同。民族國家便是人民屬於同一民族的國家。近代的所謂民族主義，就是民族求獨立，求成為一個國家的運動。非民族國家便是人民不屬於同一民族的國家，荷蘭是一民族國家，因為他的人民俱屬於荷蘭民族，其血統，語言，宗敎，風俗，習慣及歷史無一不同。比利時便不是一個民族國家，因為比利時的人民屬於兩種民族，在南部的是接近法蘭西民族的瓦龍人在北部的是接近荷蘭民族的佛勒芒人。民族國家優於非民族國家，因為民族國家的團結力較强。我們中國的人民雖說有漢滿蒙回藏五種民族但四萬萬人民中，中華民族實佔百分之九十八以上。滿人早巳與漢人合成中華民族漢回與漢人除宗敎外，一切俱極接近，只有蒙人藏人及新疆的若干小民族，以及西南未開化的苗族，尙不能算是與漢人同一民族。但道些人民同漢人也有過六七百年的共同的政治歷史，所以與漢人也甚接近，一個國家有這麼多的人民，而這麽多的人民又幾乎結合於同一民族之下，這是世界各國俱及不上我國的一件事，也是我們最可以自豪的一件事。蘇聯算是全世界最大的國家，人良衆多僅次於我國與印度，但蘇聯一萬六千餘萬的人民中僅一萬二千萬人屬於大俄羅斯民族，其餘　是不同的民族。蘇聯尙是及不上中國，其餘的國家更是望塵莫及了。</p>
<p>關於人民方面，我國的第二優點，就是中華民族不獨是最大，而且也是具有最悠的久歷史，圾古的文化的民族，從這悠久的歷史中我們可以曉得我們祖先的奮鬥的精神，可以發現我們民族對於人類的偉大的供獻，中華民族。一向不是生於安樂，長於安樂的民族，也不是無德無能的民族。在我們民族發展的過程中，我們曾經過外挨無數的侵略。從三代的夷狄，中經秦漢的匃奴，唐代的突厥回紇，宋代的遼金　蒙古以至明代的滿洲，我中華民族幾乎時時刻有滅亡的危險，然而因為民族素質的渾厚，這些侵略的民族，或者被我們所滅亡，或則被我們所同化最終仍是中華民族的勝利。自從上一世紀歐洲的勢力東侵以來，我們國家又有時時被減亡的危險，到了近幾年來，國家的生命更是不絕如縷。在這萬分緊急的開頭，我們更應有堅强的民族自信力。我相信，我們愈熟知我們民族過去的歷史，我們必愈能增加我們對於我們民族的自信力。</p>
<p>但我們的人民也有三大缺點。第一個缺點是人民智識的不發達。世界文明各國，其不識字的人民，絕不會過白分之三十。但是我國的人民則至少有百分之八十不識字，未受過敎育。因為不識字，未受過敎育，所以不能知己，也不能知彼。人家的富强，中國的人民不知道，人家的侵略，中國人民也不懂得；同時中華民族光榮的歷史，中國人也不知道去寳貴。因是中華人民雖是同一民族，而民族的意識與國家的觀念都是十二分的薄弱，這種缺點成了我國的一種致命傷。</p>
<p>第二，我中華民族缺乏科學的頭腦。因為缺乏科學的頭腦，所以我們從前的文化雖然有其不朽的地方，但對於現代的工業文化，則連步着人家後塵的能力也沒有。日本的古文化與我們的古文化是很接近的；但日本的物質文明，巳不讓於西方國家。為什麽呢？因為日本人有科學的頭腦。我們科學頭腦不如人，所以工業文化尙未發達，然而處今日的世界，沒有工業文化，又次不能立國。所以為我們的民族計，凡足以妨害科學頭腦的發達的事情，如同古代的科舉敎育，必須嚴格的禁止，而接近大自然的敎育，則必須盡力提倡。（未完）</p>

<p>西洋文化用了不可抵抗的勢力而侵入中國來。同時中國文化也用了頑强的勢力而保住牠的傳統。於是中國人的思想上，生活上，處處出現新舊文化同時並存的狀態。這叫做二重生活。譬如：這裏在組織小家庭，那裏在勵行九世同居。這裏在登離婚廣吿，那裏在建貞節牌坊。甚至兩種狀態出現在一份人家裏，或者一個人身上，造成了種種的煩悶與苦痛。</p>
<p>大家只知道把年來民生的不安，歸罪於天災人禍，內亂外患等種種大原因上。殊不知除此以外，還有一種最切身地使民生不安的原因，便是這二重生活。牠能使一般民衆左顧右慮，東張西望，茫然莫知所適從，始終徬徨在生活的歧途上。牠能使各種言行找得到成立的根據，各種罪惡找　到辯護的理由，以致是非顚倒，黑白混淆。為了生活的方針而滿腹躊躇，煞費苦心：終於陷入盲從，遭逢失敗的，在近來中國的民間不知有幾千萬人呢！不說別的，但看二重生活上最小的一件　——陰曆陽曆的並存，已足够使人麻煩殺了！</p>
<p>「誠於中，必形於外，」豈獨個人如此？社會也是這樣的。度着二重生活的我國的民間社會裏，處處顯露着時代錯誤的不調和狀態，形成了一個奇妙的漫畫世界。漫畫在最近的我國相當地流行，二重生活正是其主因。試閒步市街中，靜觀其現狀，必可發見種種二重生活的不調和狀態，可笑或可驚。流綫型的汽車旁邊有時興抬過一頂官轎。電車前面有時肩過兩扇「肅靜」迴　」的行牌。水門汀的人行道上走着上一雙　鞋。虹霓燈的鄰近掛着六隻紅紗燈。鐵路旁邊並列着一　石造的環洞橋。兩座高層建築的中間夾着一所古廟。……走進屋內；有時你會看見洋房的Drawingo　Rom裏，掛着「天宮賜福」，供着香爐蠟台和兩串紙做的金元寳。抽水馬桶間的對門，貼着一姜太公在此百無禁忌」的黃紙條。若是冬天，你會看見頭戴大禮帽而坐在寗式眠床上的人；銅火爐而手捧水烟筒的人。若是喜慶日子，你會看見古代的新娘與現代的新郎，和穿裝行跪拜禮的人，若是為了病人，你還可看見西醫和道士一同走進這份人家呢。……</p>
<p>但這也不是我們中國特有的狀態。日本也是如此。在形式上，也可說在美術上，日本是東洋風最盛的國家。東方古代生活的種種樣式，例如蓆地而坐，木展而行，以及男女服裝，禮貌等，在中國早已廢棄，在日本至今還奉行着。當明治維新，西方文化傳入日本的時候，他們社會裏的二重生活狀態，恐怕此我們現在的更加可笑又可驚呢。著名的浮世繪大家芳年的作品中，就有譏諷當時的不調和狀態的繪畫。他盡明治初年、的國會議員，身穿「羽織」（Haori日本的外套），腰束圍裙（Hakama），而頭戴西洋的大禮帽，脚登西洋的皮鞋，成個滑稽的樣子。近代日本的美術論者，也有咀咒東京的二重生活的。例如：穿了木展乘電車，古裝新娘與燕尾服新郎，洋風大建築與日本風古屋，鳥居Tuo木造的牌坊）並列，穿洋裝的人相見時跪下來行日本禮……他們說這東西洋風的並存，使街景不調和，使環境醜惡化，是「非美術的」。他們努力要求改進，要求調和，要求市街的美術化。住在現在中國社會裏的美術家，美術愛好者，和關心「市容」者，對於他們這種　咒與要求，大約都有同感罷？</p>
<p>這種咀咒與要來固有正當的理由，但那　不調和相也是必然的產物。西洋文化用了不可抵抗的勢而衝進東洋來，不接受是不可　的。</p>
<p>然而誰能一掃東洋舊習，使牠立刻全部西洋化呢？推美術家的心，似乎希望立刻全部西洋化，使人立在東京或上海的街上，感覺得如同立在巴黎或倫敦的街上一樣。否則，索性全部東洋風，使人住在現代社會裏，感覺得如同往在古代社會裏一樣。然而兩者都是不可能的。回復古代當然做不到；全部西洋化「談何容易？」即使「容易」，，註：憶某古人說，此容易一字不相連，乃何容二字相連，今强用之。）我們的鼻頭天生成不高，眼睛天生成不藍，皮　天生成不白，這西洋化也是不徹底的，那麽生在現代中國的我們，對於這事應取甚樣的態度呢？我們將始終度送這種可笑的不調和的二重生活麽？</p>
<p>不，我們的前途，自有新的道路正待開闢。這是東西洋文化的「化合」路，也可說是世界文化的「大同」路。物質文明發跡於西洋，但不是西洋所專有的，應是現世一切民族所不得不接受的「時代」的贈物了。現今我國所有各種物質文明的建設，大半是硬子子地從西洋搬運進來的，生吞活剝地插在本國土内。一切可笑的，不調和的二重生活，卽由此產生。換言之，目前我們的生活中，東西洋文化「混合」着，所以有二重。項得敎牠們「化合」起來，產生第三種新生活，然後方可免除上述的種種醜惡與苦痛。進言之，西洋不永遠是先進民族。今後的世界，定將互相影響，互相移化，漸漸趨於「大同」之路。</p>
<p>我們對於各種奮習應該不惜放棄，對於各種新潮　該不怕接受。只要以「合理」為本，努力創新的生活，便合於世界大同之旨了。聽說日本人曾有廢除其原有的文字而改用羅馬孛橫排的提議。又有廢除美術學校裏的「日本畫系」與「西洋　系」的分立而僅設一「繪畫系」的企圖。然而還沒有功成。記得中國也曾有少數人試用橫寫的，注音字母拚成的國音，然而沒有人顧問。這當然不是容易辦到的事。但我却在這裏愚痴地夢想：置軍備，事戰爭，無非為了謀人類生活的幸福。誠能敎世界各國大家把軍備和戰爭所用的經費如數省下來，移作未來的「大同世界」的建設費，這一定不難實現，全人類的生活一定幸福得多！世間的美術家一定歡慶尤深！可惜這只是我的夢想。</p>

<h3 id="c63">工部局公用委員會　討論電話加價事宜 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>中外委員逐條考量　四國專家列席置答</p>
<p>工部局電話專家特別委員會電話問題報吿書、自提出於工部局董事會後、工部局公用委員會曾於星期一日（十月二十八日）召集會議、討論電話事項、並由各專家列席、以備諮詢、各專家列席者、計有胡君瑞祥·（中）稻田君·（日）勃郎君·（英）及雷氏·（美）公用委員會各委首詢專家、當各專家擬具各項建議時、目前普遍社會經濟衰落狀况、是否曾加考慮、專家勃郎答稱、此節在報吿書之開始、雖未論及、但最後之各種建議、則與目前經濟狀况、不無相當之關係云、公用委員會某委表示、報告書並未詳述、倘工部局决定保留按具收費辦法時、究應如何加價之處、故該報吿書、尙未足謂為完備、勃郎氏答、此問題極簡單、上海電話公司、自四月一日至七月終之間、所得純利、巳幾及百分之十、惟對於話機减少上之損失、若再增加按具話費百分之十一·公司即可獲得百分之十之純利、雷氏繼稱、若現有按具話費為達到應有純利起見、而再與增加、則話機數目、必更减少、如是、則話價勢必再增、故即在按具制之下、公司收入、仍無確當按制之方法云、後由各委建議、各專家同意、在報吿書後、加一附帶書、陳述倘須保留按具制時、應採用何種價目、</p>
<p>繼討論報吿書中「機件」一節、勃郎氏稱、彼曾親自訪問電話用戶五六十家、雷氏亦稱、曾與用戶二三十人談話、彼等均稱、現在之供應、實較前此所有者、勝過甚遠、勃郎氏稱、彼未能與甚多數之日人用戶接談、但據與少數日人談話之結果、彼可决定輿論當必極為滿意、稻田氏稱、彼曾與多數日人晤談、彼等均稱、電話供應、極為優良、惟其中有一部份、曾涉及與華界通話時之種種因難云、</p>
<p>當討論支出一節時、所載、「無形資本三萬餘元」一節、曾有人提及、據云、該條係從舊公司老賬入、蓋即所付資產之代價·及日後價格整理移、兩者之間之差數也、且改裝自動機以來、在業務擴充上、資本支出、業巳增加云、勃郎氏稱、公司支出之總數、約四千萬元之譜、該項數目、即為一九三四年該公司一切資產數目之估計、其自舊公司盤入以及自行添置者、至該時為止、悉在其內、內復如報吿書中所載、列具各種財產、然後構成公司投資之總額、在更換自動機之後、淸理手續浩繁、不得不稍見遲緩、故至一九三四年七月、始有通盤之估計云、雷氏復稱、此四千萬元者、第一、即一九三四年舊公司機件估計之結果、此項估計、係一九三〇年八月五日所作、其餘則屬新機件之費用、及一九三〇年以來所建築之產業、換言之、即視在應用中之舊產業、合以自一九三〇年後新建築之產業、即等於四千寓元也、</p>
<p>某委當即詢及、在一九三〇年與一九三四年之間、折舊如何處置之方、勃郎氏謂、按照其他一切電話公司之慣例、凡欲保持資本完整者、必須在產業之全部、覓得一折舊之公率、此項公率尋求之辦法、須於各部逐步行之、即機件之每部、先須定其壽命之久暫、再乘之以每部投資之數目、此項百分率、若施行於電話公司機件之全部、即達每年百分之四·五、無論何公司、此項折舊百分率、即應提存、作為公司資產之攤提、勃朗繼稱、此種折舊計算方法、於公司用戶、雙方均屬有利、因公司所投資本之得享受純利者、非四千萬而為三千四百萬元也、</p>
<p>繼論及各站機件裝置、某委曾詢及、自動機改換工作之迅速完成、於最後費用上、有無增减之處、勃郎氏稱、此問題、頗難於置答、因其中有相對比之成分、應加以權衡也、在一方面、為求工作合於科學化起見、特自世界各國、延致工程師五十人、專司其事、費用自必增加、但同時因延用此項極頂專門人才之故、工作得以尅日完成、全部人員、應得薪給之期間、遂以縮短、約略計之、工作求其迅速完全、費用不得不有些一微之增加、但頗不能確定加以斷論云、某委復詢更改自動機之工作、須於兩年之內完全、是否為一種不合理之要求、勃郎氏稱、其中並無不合理之處、</p>
<p>關乎匯兌一項、某委會詢及公司方面、究用何法、防止滙兌滙落之損失、工部局財務處處長答、公司方面、巳在適當之匯率及時期淸結其滙兌、故以全局而論、電局用戶、在通盤計算上、可無庸過慮云、</p>
<p>各委禮復論及公司之營業及維持費用、據各專家之意見、該項設備機件等費用、除可以取資於中國或較現有者較近之地點外、實無從加以减省、至如報告書中所述、上海電話公司每具話機之全部費用、達四十六元二角云云、究係與何者相比、勃郎氏稱、可與相比者、如中國每具話機之全部費用爲三十五元、日本則爲三十七元云、但在上海一埠、支出所以增加、尙有其他原因、大部份均載於報吿書中、某委於此處復指出、公司中享受高薪洋員之數目、即屬重要原因之一、惟不有此等高薪之洋員、外人投資、决無如此之踴躍云、雷氏表示、須在同一管轄下之公司、其標準相等者、始可為適當之比擬、故在美國、一地所採用之價格、在他處即往往為法庭所駁斥云、勃郎氏亦稱、英美二國電話建築、各有其不同之點、故貿然以之相提並論、頗屬不公、惟以上海情形而言、在供應上、其費用尙不為過高云、</p>
<p>關乎按次收費一層、勃郎氏稱、彼曾接得函件論文數百件之多、據彼之見解、其中大部份係發源於濫用電話之人、彼曾親自加以調查、發覺許多濫用之弊、此種弊病、亦即世界各處所以放棄按具收費辦法之原因、在十餘年以前、英國下院、亦會論及此事、據下院委員會之報告、當時主張保留按具收費制者、僅屬「儘量利用」之少數用戶、所謂「利用」者、實即「濫用」、故特別委員會、深願阻止用戶僅付按具收費之月租、而每月通話次數、達二千以上、但如報告畫中所載、住宅用戶之過半、此後將付較廉之話費云、雷氏亦稱、在現行按具收費制下、公司之收獲、悉來自小用戶、而大用戶方面、公司反受損失、故小用戶所支出者、其一部份即屬其用戶享用之代價云、再則倘按具所付之價、再行增加、話機數目、勢必遞减、而供應之效用、亦不因之銷縮、此由上海經濟社會各方面言之、均屬不利、若採用按次計算之價目、小用戶將首蒙其利、訂用電話之人、亦必增加、功用逐漸普遍、此即按次計算法最簡單之哲理云、</p>
<p>某委繼聲稱、一般小用戶、雖云此後可以節省話費、惟大部份仍贊成按具收費辦法、因沿用按具收費辦法、收入較易控制、公司旣巳允其取得百分之十三贏利、則在現有制度下、即可結以不多於百分之十、亦不少於百分之十之贏利云、</p>
<p>勃郎氏稱、當電話特別委員會討論通話次數减縮一節之時、並未謂百分之三七·五為確切不移之數、該數不過為日本减縮成案百分之五十、及英國减縮成案百分之二十五、兩者之間折中之數目、惟當時在英國之通話次數、並不甚高、故改用按次收費制後、影饗尙小、目前上海電話用戶、通話次數極高、故日後低减之成分亦極大、一將來低减之程度、勢必超過百分之二十五、或竟　百分之三七·五、亦未可知、勃郎氏復稱、上海電話公司投資上所得贏利、並非超越常態、如丹麥京城電話公司、前此享受、與此相等之贏利者、繼續共二十年之久、即美國貝爾系各公司、每年所獲純利、亦恒在八九　之間、　　氏又謂、按具收費辦法、絕對不公允、且流弊滋多云、再則復據各專家所稱、將來公司贏利倘在一分之上、話費仍可要求其低减、目前因欲採用按次收費辦法之故、數目祇可求其約略、在此點上、遂不能如按具收費辦法之易於準確、但以上述各理由觀之、此點亦非重要、但倘此後仍須沿用按具收費之辦法、則局方勢不得不同竟於一極鉅大之支出、屆時或須以三萬元之資金、添築一中央接綫機關、以應非常高額通話次數之需要、目前電話公司中央區之設備、在恒常狀態之下、足給一萬用戶之供應、但以非常高額通話之故、供給缺少之處極多、倘最近將來、通話次數不入常軌、而經濟狀態、漸見起色之時、公司方面、在營業區域之中、將不得不增加一萬綫單位之設備云、</p>
<p>繼由主席綜計上述各委及各專家意見之槪要如下、公司之收入、在按具收費制下、較在按次收費制下、易於計算、但電話專委會、則覺即在按次收費制下計算、亦不至相差甚遠、　等復覺按次收費之利益、足以掩蓋此次顧慮而有餘、而使之為確然可取之辦法、主席復提醒各委、謂在各專家尙未蒞滬之前、上海電話公司在與工部局磋商之中、曾允將來按次收費辦法實行之後、願於一年之中、將超額贏利增收之數、歸入話價改訂賬項下、此項計議、今後仍可向公司提出、規定試騐期間、諒公司方面、在相同條件之下、决不致推翻原議也、</p>
<p>後委員中、復有詢及通話記數機之是否可恃者、勃郎氏稱、在各種簡單而不易損毀之機械構造之中、電話通話記數機、實為最可靠諸物之一、中國專家胡瑞祥氏復陳述此種機械工作之內容、並謂此機所記錄者、僅巳完成通話之次數云、現在上海用戶、每日平均通話次數、據勃郎氏所言、住宅每日平均十一次、商家每日平均十八次、並稱、新制實行之後、因而享受利益者、商家百分之五十、住宅百分之五十九、</p>
<p>關乎現在建議之按次收費辦法之話價、係以公司純利百分之八·五四計算一節、某委曾提出特許合同上之條欵、即公司　利不足之數、公司仍有權可以記入話費改訂賬項下、勃郎氏對於此點稱、各專家均巳明瞭、</p>
<p>工部局財務處處長復觀察新制實施之後、公司所投資本上之贏利、約在百分之八·五八、而不足之數、將記入話費改訂項下、但公司將來頗有改進之機會、俾贏利得增至百分之十、至何時可以達到此目的、則全視此後之環境云、雷氏之解釋為、倘將來話機之數目不見加增、則公司所得贏利、或祗及百分之八、但倘話機數目能如所預期者加增、則公司贏利亦必較豐云、</p>
<p>某委複詢所裝　綫　是否可以任意通話、不加限制、勃郎氏稱不然、第一綫每月租費十元、第二綫及以上各綫、每月付費五元、並不附帶通話次數、故通話次數、無論在第一綫及其他各副綫、僅有一百五十次可以免費、其餘悉須按照次數納費云、</p>
<p>會議至此、吿一段落、定十一月七日重開、遂宣吿散會、</p>

<p>發刋綠起</p>
<p>上海為全國工商業樞紐，故上海一埠工商業之盛衰，影響於全國者甚大，本所以使命所在，平日收集關于工商各業資料頗多，嗣後擬在本刋，每週發表一次，以個別之每一種工業或商業為題，期將最近工商業之眞相，成敗之因果，以及將來之趨勢，有系統的提供於讀者之前，以盡一得之愚，惟茲　體大，缺漏舛誤，在所未免，尙望各界　而敎之，無任戚幸。</p>
<p>近三年來上海工商業異動槪况</p>
<p>一，緒言</p>
<p>按各國徵信所，曁其他統計機關，每有「事業失敗」Business　Failure及「新資本發行」Now　Capital　Issue之統計，試以工商業之興替，其一般趨勢，固可以物價指數及市場經騐，加以推定，然欲進而研究各業成敗之原因，未來之動向，以及各業間相互之消畏，則非主意於上述二項統計不可，本所成立以來，亦頗注意於收集此項資料，惟各國商號，凡稍具規模者，什九為公司組織，股票及債票之發行，有官書可考，我國工商界情形，則異於是，公司組織為數寥寥，商店未經註冊者，亦居多數，新資本發行，幾無從統計，其事業失敗一項，則復以「改組」「加記」等名目，極易混淆，嚴格而論，則「改組」「加記」，可謂巳包含舊商號之消滅，與新商號之創始，作實際情形，則並不嚴重若此，同人等斟酌至再，爰將本所收集資料之標準，列為新創，改組，及閉歇三端，其改組一項，雖不若閉歇之嚴重，然當市面寰落之際，改組必多，其趨向固與閉歇，大同而小異也，本篇將廿二年份起，至本年六月份止，上海一埠之工商業新創，改組，閉歇二項數字，加以分析研究，其資料收集之方法，大部係取材於各日報，再以本所平日調查所得，加以補充，其中規模狹小，新創閉歇，均未見報端，且與金融業無往來者，恐仍多忽略，又各年資料收集方法，頗多改進，亦足以影響數字，望讀者加以注意焉。</p>
<p>二，三年來之異動數字</p>
<p>自民國十八年世界經濟恐慌爆發以來，中國因受銀價低落之掩護，表面尙呈繁榮，惟嗣後世界經濟恐慌，日益深刻，外有「九一八」瀋陽之變，及「一二八」淞滬之戰，復有各國放棄金本位之舉，銀價回漲，內有水旱為災，變亂迭出，全國經濟，大受打擊，其表現與上海一埠者，尤為明顯，茲將最近三年來之異動數字，列表比較如左：</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>民國二十二年　一〇〇　一〇〇　一〇〇</p>
<p>民國二十三年　八〇·四〇　二·一一六·一四　一七一·〇五</p>
<p>民國二十四年　五四·八七　三·〇五四·五三　二三三·七一</p>
<p>如以二十二年每月平均數字為基準，則三年來異動指數之升降如左。。</p>
<p>照右表所示，近三年來新創指數，年有低落，若以二十四年與二十二年相較，則新創指數，低落百分之四五·一三，閉歇指數，增兩倍餘，改組指數，則劇增至三十餘倍。</p>
<p>茲再將二十三年全年，及本年爲首六個月每月異動數字，詳列如左（單位一家）</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>二十三年一月　一〇　九二　一一八</p>
<p>二月　四　四一　一一七</p>
<p>三月　一七　二一七　三三</p>
<p>四月　一三　一四三　三六</p>
<p>五月　一一　一一八　四六</p>
<p>六月　二〇　一三〇　三三</p>
<p>七月　六　八一　二五</p>
<p>八月　九　八一　三四　九月　一〇〇　一〇〇　三二</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>二十四年一月　一〇　一一五　五四</p>
<p>二月　四　一五五　五一</p>
<p>三月　一四　一九二　三</p>
<p>四月　一一　一六〇　一四</p>
<p>五月　四　一五八　四五</p>
<p>六月　五　一五一　五三</p>
<p>七月</p>
<p>八月</p>
<p>九月</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>二十三年十月　一四　一三七　三三</p>
<p>十一月　一四　五九　二四</p>
<p>十二月　一一　一五　一五</p>
<p>合計　一四七　一二九〇　三六六</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>合計半年四八　九三一　二五〇</p>
<p>據上表，新創者二十三年以六九三月為最多，二十四年上期以三四月為最多，改組者二十三年以三四十月為最多，二十四年上期以三四月為最多，閉歇者二十三年以五四八月為最多，二十四年上期以一六月為最多，按往時異動，常在節關，今則此種季節性，似巳失去。（未完）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>有一天晚上凉風送爽，小孩們均巳睡了，大的幾個還在溪邊洗浴，裴夫人正在坐落間裏為坦第脫衣，忽然他喊道，「啊，我的唐納！」手指着月色期照的窗。</p>
<p>『不，心肝，他不在那裏，那是美麗的月亮罷了，』他的母親說道。</p>
<p>『不，不，唐納在一個窗前；坦第看見他的，』小寳寳固執着說，他現出很興奮的神氣。</p>
<p>『這也許是可能的，』裴夫人說了忙趕到窗口，希望可以證實小孩的說話，可是沒一個臉兒，也沒發見生人的一點踪跡；她呌他的名字，抱了只留一些小汗衫的坦第到前門去，並且要他也呌，想來小寳寳的聲音或者比她的要有力量。可是並沒一點回答，也不見一點東西發現，他們於是廢然而返，不過坦第想來决不便是月亮，所以等到他巳經睏在小眠床裏以後，還不時仰起頭來問『唐納是否「開要來老。」』</p>
<p>不久他睡熟了，童子們都去睡了，屋子裏逐漸靜寂，只間有草虫的鳴聲一破這溶溶的靜夜而巳。裴夫人坐着做縫紉的工作，因為那個大筐子總是堆滿了襪子，上面布滿了大可呑象的破洞，同時在想着那個走失的童子。她决定小寳寳是錯了的，所以也不進去吿訴裴先生，因小孩子的幻想反致打斷了他的工作，原來那個可憐的人非到童子們就寢以後，自己很少有些時間空下來？現在正忙着寫信呢。等到她立起來去關屋子的門，時己在十點鐘以後了。她看見那可愛的光景，不免在階上流連下一。忽然散在草坪上許多乾草堆之一，上面一種白的不知什麽東西引起了她的注意。原來那天整個下午孩子們都在那裏玩着，裴夫人設想，或者又是南恩棄掉的白帽子，因此過去要把它取回。但當她走近時，她才見到這不是帽子，也不是手帕，而只是一伴襯衫的袖子，有一隻皮色焦黃的手伸出在外面，她跑過那乾草堆，呀那邊就睡着唐恩，睡得很熱。</p>

<p>— （徐豪吾）</p>
<p>不輪是自殺，夭亡，壽終：是情切骨肉，撫棺一慟；是一朝眼中釘去，落得親蒞靈堂，將喜作悲，顯示出死者的狹量難容，自己的人格偉大；或是特雇「專員」，「遵禮成服」，放聲痛哭：整個靈堂，總瀰漫着一片號咷喊苦的聲音。</p>
<p>死總給象徵着苦悶，憂鬱，悲憤的淚，千篇一律地染上了一層悽絕人寰的色彩。</p>
<p>其實，萬物難逃一死。不死求死固不必；死期巳屆，祇要花生人格事業，一天有一天的　績，不負造物賦予身心形態的苦心，死復何戀，死亦何苦？</p>
<p>一屍橫陳，自有它靜默的，含義深長的韻味。蚩蚩者氓，不從這方面嚴肅自省，徒事習俗相沿，哀號徬徨。雖曰「兔死狐悲」；冷眼旁觀，未免見小失大。</p>
<h3 id="c151">最偉大的發明物 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>

<p>假使你去問幾個人，那一種東西，他們承認為自古迄今最偉大的發明物，那麼多數的回答是這樣的東西，像蒸氣機啊，發電機啊，電報機啊。但是這些只不過是一種較早而重要發明的結果而已。自古迄今，最早而最偉大的人類發明物是鎚。</p>
<p>沒有一把鎚，任何細小的建設的工作，你都不能着手做。雖則在實際上你或許可以不直接用着它，但是你用以工作的工具，却要用它來做成的。鎚是使人們增加氣力的第一件工具；祇有赤手空拳，難以做成甚麽東西的。鎚大槪是一位天賦一種神通去用一塊石子擊碎一隻牡蠣或一隻蛾螺的殼的遠祖所發明的。最早的鎚是沒有柄的。祗是一塊石子，形狀做得便於執在手掌之中。</p>
<p>把這樣的石子，結在一個柄上，你便有有了比較有效的工具了。把它常用的一端，一片一片的斫去，使成銳利的鋒口，便變成一柄石斧了。最早打火石工具的錄口的做成，完全靠了一把鎚。這樣的鎚便產生了最早的割切斫伐工具，斧頭和手斧二種東西。從手斧與鑿子到鋸子，只是一個階級。鑽錐不過是一種雛型的鑿子。這是第一樣裝有圓柄，用手掌來旋轉的東西；後來，原始人發明弓和製成繞在弓上的繩。有弓與繩的鑽錐，至今有幾種工藝上，依舊要用看它的。</p>
<p>有了鎚，斧，鋸和鑿的一套工具，人們可以把巨大圓本做成小塊或長條，製造車輪或其他輪形物。他所製造的海一樣工具，用他的工具而做成的每一樣東西，都能使他的氣力去控制天然間其他一切較强較大的力。現在有幾種龐大的機器，祇要用一隻手指去接觸一下，便可使它發動，停止，加快，或减慢，我們就可看到這種鎚斧鋸鑿的結合之功續。所以無論我們想來還會有甚麽偉大，巧妙，重要的東西發明，但是歸根結底，我們要歸功於第一個用石子去擊碎牡蠣的人。</p>

<p>乙亥重陽後三日，有事武林，遄歸湖上。旣夜，乃驅汽車投净慈寺，若瓢，萬圓二僧聞聲出迎。茗罷，置酒坐净業院轟飲。座多謔語。笑聲輙達戶外。寺內無葷食，出所携平脯薰魚片佐酒，為味津津。因念生平所宿蘭若凡三，曰萬年，曰中方廣，曰天童，此其四也，而歡樂倍之。時儈衆盡眠，聞無人聲。凉月窺窗，嚴霜在地。聞四壁秋蟲如雨，恍若置身夢境。</p>

<p>侵晨，聞南屏鐘聲徐動，遂披衣出寺，與糞翁，夢祁，若瓢泛舟入湖。曉霧方濃，迷漫若幕。遙矚葛嶺雙峯，已失所在，但六橋二潭時一隱現而巳。蓋湖面受水氣掩映，飄忽舒幻，晦顯不定耳。出白雲菴菴，霧氣益重，着衣欲濕，四顧舟身，蒼茫如浮大海間，乃令舟子撤槳，狂歌燜漫，不復知人間何世也。余因謂同遊諸子曰：「今日之遊，實離塵俗，更何必乘桴耶」？同人皆大快。炊許，霧止，日出，厥光融融，乃自小瀛洲鼓棹歸。人謂西湖景色，晴湖不及雨湖，余則謂雨湖不及霧湖，雨湖奇，霧尤奇。</p>
<p>滿覺隴探桂</p>
<p>桂以色別者，有金桂，銀桂。以時別有，有早桂，遲桂。昔西湖桂市，多在靈隱三竺間，南部新書載：一杭州靈隱山多桂，寺儈曰月中桂也，至今中秋夜往往子墜一，又羣芳譜云：「山桂天竺最多，儈稱月中桂，其花時常不絕，枝頭葉底，依稀數點，亦異種也」。今則以滿覺隴為盛其桂，諸色悉具，秋可數花。花時金海銀濤，香被數里，四方來探者，肩摩踵接。居民輙置桌椅於樹下，為觀者茗坐遊憩之用，每期所獲頗豐。秋色旣酣，挈二三詩友，作探桂之遊。自净慈寺雇人力車往，六里，抵翁家山麓，陂路漸高，車顚蹶不能上，乃去革履，着儈鞋，柱杖以行。至滿覺隴，遲桂巳謝。林間桌椅縱橫，銀瓣狼藉，殘香猶時時襲人衣樣也，為呼負負，亭午，過水樂洞，聽泉聲泠泠，節奏天然，始有爽意。</p>
<p>龍井</p>
<p>鼎革後，西湖亦數變其態。堤岸日寬，湖面日窄，安知其他日之不為田哉？斯可為西子憂也。近日大腹買，多喜占西湖一席地以為榮，樓臺櫛比，屋多於山。彼之託各風雅者，其實玷辱湖山耳。余謂今日之遊西湖者，目所接惟洋樓夷館，耳所聞則汽車機聲，囂塵萬種，靜態頓失。欲求往昔之跨一驢，而徜徉於板橋烟柳間，其尙可得耶？同遊諸子皆有同感，乃决裏糧湖山深處，則惟風　嶺，九溪，理安乎？議定。自三台山東行，繁囂漸絕，心境為之一快。過靈石山，望羣山環裏，崒壁參差，溪壑彌深。空山鳴鳩，浮雲四合，們有雨意。入風　嶺，道旁黃葉，簌簌作響，蒼筤蓧蕩，均節淒清。抵二老亭，雨遂至。湖上烟雲冉冉，景緻奇絕。回望胡公嶺，落暉塢盡沉霧裏。欲越烟霞嶺，遊九溪理安，阻雨不果。因與施子叔範，王子鐵華擁爐亭上。靜聽松鼎茶沸，胸次悠然，若有所得。午餘天霽，自茅家埠歸謁岳墓。登淸源酒家小酌，追味斯遊，不覺盡醉。</p>

<p>— 袁一民醫師</p>
<p>欲談淋病的治療方法，先要把淋病是怎樣的一種疾症以及其情狀等，略說一說，然後可以明瞭何種方法是合理，何者為不合理了。初次感染淋病，大都是急性前尿道淋，例外的很少，所謂前尿道淋，就是指淋菌僅在前尿道部分侵襲繁殖著而言。論理局部的病症，只須行局部的治療，撲滅淋菌藥物，俯拾卽是，何須行其他療法，何以中外醫家都認為牠是難治之症呢？因為淋菌是潛伏在尿道粘膜內層的，欲圖凈殺淋菌，而絲毫無損於粘膜，在斯狹隘的辦法之下，所以覺得困難了，但能施之有素，自能根本痊愈。療淋的方法有種種，電療，洗射，注射及內服，電療，利用透熱法者有長波短波之別，長波須緊貼肌體而施行，不但施用麻煩，且多流弊，時有灼傷肌膚之虞，而收效鮮少，近世所賞用者，莫如短波透熱電，隔衣可以療治，奏效亦復確速，利用電械之光力以殺菌者，莫如最新療濁機，此機之光力，旣可深透肌膚，而毫無損害。洗射，就是以滅淋藥液注入於尿道內，洗液對於病情之分配，使用之濃度和時間，在在相關，現時更賞用淋病血淸之注入，此種製劑中之最佳者，為『淋毒舒藥耳』Gono—Serol，注射就是打針，黃色素及混合淋苗，治療上頗有地位，黃色素能透膜殺菌，混合淋菌能使內體產生抗菌體，因而達撲滅菌之目的，此中製劑中之稍佳者，有Antiseptine　Trypaflavine，內服藥以能止痛消炎殺菌力強，有尿路消毒深透粘膜者為上，切忌含有強烈之收斂成份，現時各醫家所採用之滅殺淋，頗為適合，乃屬優秀之製劑。治淋雖如上述，然疾病變化萬端，未可一概而論，且淋病之治療，雖以一毫之差，即遺無窮之害，如愈期延長，荏苒成慢性等等，此皆錯施方法，妄投藥石之結果也，本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院，為海上名醫馮善樑先生所主持，該院治療淋症，方法之新穎，手段之老到，可謂無出其右，其他如電械設備等等，應有盡有，已臻治淋法之絕頂矣。</p>

<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>小的時候跟人家上雜耍塲去聽灘簧，最有好感的便是台上插科打譯的小丑，尤其是搖着破扇在中央坐定了，若有其事的打起開塲白來：「阿罕！天好日頭出！雨落階沿濕。」那時候不懂人情世故，不懂幽默之類的東西，可是瞧着那麽「像煞有介事」的怪相，也覺得怪有趣的。然而現在想來，則簡直覺得可憐了。</p>
<p>考戲角中小丑之所以最受歡迎的理由，第一固然是面面週到，不會得罪人。無論上上下下，左左右右，大大小小，他說給你扮一個怪臉，加上一個「也司渥萊您好嗎？」比之「言論正生」的長篇大論更受人歡迎得多。而其次，小丑的講話也着實有點功夫，這裏所說的「功夫」，不是說講出了什麽重大的東西，而實際卻是講來講去，結果還是等於沒有講。在處處埋伏的社會上，這種功夫倒是要一點的。現代的人不大容易說話；而「多吃飯，少開口」又是中國的古訓。然而人真是個奇怪的動物，說要悶着嘴一聲不響倒也很不容易的，而一開口則「禍從口出」的危機是隨時跟着你來了。無已，從小處着想，為「天下太平」的大事計，就有人出來提倡「談狐說鬼講蒼蠅」等等；可是狐鬼雖渺茫，蒼蠅雖微小，結果總還有着一點東西。要如果照老法子見了人說「今天天氣好啊」，那更不妥了，第一是這話的批評色彩太濃，你說天氣好是也許因為拿到了薪水的緣故；而我一定要說天氣不好，你那裏會懂得我的心境呢？那便是說，也許因為是剛才借錢碰了釘子。主觀的批評是要不得的，客觀的批評又是「免開尊口」，於是在「談狐說鬼講蒼蠅」之外來一個小丑式的「天好日頭出，雨落階沿濕。」一種說話的方法。</p>
<p>據說，過去的一個年頭是個「幽默年」，今年的什麽年什麽年又滿天星斗，然而照情勢說來，「天好日頭出」的人生哲學大約還不至於背時，小丑的扮相還不致被人家討厭，那末，今年或者是輪到小丑出風頭的「小丑年」也說不定吧？</p>
<p>算來，世界已走到了黑夜的盡頭，也真該有「天好日頭出」的時候了。</p>

<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>靠近城牆根的一座小門前，我停下來了。手在新油漆好的黑大門上拍了一下，裏面就有人答應，同時在門旁的小窗邊露出一個女人的頭來。我告訴了她姓名，她進去不多久，皮鞋擊着石板響的聲音柝柝地傳出，我明白這是董出來了。因為那腳步是我十分熟悉的。等到門呀的一開，他那永遠是笑着的臉就又擺在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>他的讀書的地方是一間不怎麽大的小房間，雖然時間剛剛是午後的五點鍾，黑暗已經籠罩着。他讓我坐在一把沒了背的椅子上以後，我本來預備好的幾句話也說不出來了。這是怎麽的呢？他並沒有一點拒絕我的談話的表示，而我的談話也是不會被他討厭的。但是我說不出。</p>
<p>——生活好吧？好久不見了。</p>
<p>我沉思了很久才這麽說。這類的話也不知道說過多少次了，每次見面總是如此開頭。這原因是我時常被生活的鞭子策得痛苦，甚至抬不起頭來，對於別</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>人，我也這樣想一個生在這時代裏的人，處處都是苦悶的呵！他還是笑面佛似地對我回答：</p>
<p>——還好，還好！</p>
<p>遞過一杯白　水。我飲着，巡視屋內的佈置，還很清潔，就是墻壁因年老而沒了生氣。在這殘老的壁上，掛着一幅中堂，和兩條對聯。</p>
<p>他的眼睛也隨着　的環視着　景物</p>
<p>我的動作像是才來的生客。他懷疑了嗎？問我生活怎麼樣呢？我的回答很久才說出來，便是我預備好的那些話。我真實地告訴他，我的生活上的痛苦，以及其他的事，最要的還是想向他借一點錢。</p>
<p>很清楚的擺在那里，他也沒有錢；但是，他還有個家，我呢，我沒有家，沒有朋友，不，有一位，就是董。</p>
<p>他把那永遠是微笑的臉收斂住了，換出一幅被深切的友愛攫住的熱情的面容，伸出那隻握人永遠是緊緊的緊緊的的手，向着我，表示非常的歉意。</p>
<p>——你該知道我的，我的家庭沒有方法供給我錢，（放低聲音說：）父親只知道抽，母親只知道積錢，我是得不到一個錢用的。這實在是…</p>
<p>兩隻手向一道兒搓着，好像他是太抱歉了。</p>
<p>於是，我們　到別的問題上去。</p>
<p>大槪是他父親回來了，對過的房子裏談話聲時時可以傳過來，隨着陣雅片烟的香味。</p>
<p>在我要辭出時，恰巧趕到他向這屋裏走。我也跟着回到原來的地方，這是他的意見，他想和我談幾句話。談話的時候，　手里托着發光的白銅，水烟袋，吱嘍吱嘍地吸着，在先，他詢問我關於董在學校裏的事，又詢問過我的，才發出他的論顯：</p>
<p>——我就還不讃成這個洋學堂，別看他媽媽的時興。…你看董學成什麽樣子啦，就說結親（作者註：結婚）這回事吧，他還反對哩！…反對？反對我就不叫他上，看看暑假以後為繳學費！</p>
<p>「突」的，把一團烟灰吹掉了。</p>
<p>董呆呆地立在床邊，兩腿依住床緣。兩眼不時注視望着天花板，或潮濕的土地。也望着我好像許多煩悶都堆在他身上了。我呢，我像一個陪判者，有些啼笑皆非。他父親却未向誰表示什麽就走出去了。我安慰了他，空着肚子走出那座黑漆大門。</p>
<p>自慰地，我怎謝沒有家，沒有親近人的累贅，但是，我向那裏走呢？肚子餓了，衣服爛了，明天或今天的生活如何去維持呢？</p>
<h3 id="c169">籘轎與洋車 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>鄉行小誌</p>
<p>火車駛進外揚旗，我從窗口向車站望去，在木柵外面的馬路兩旁，從前黑色的一個個鴿房般的籘轎的地位，現在已完全被洋車佔據了，不，毋甯說被洋車代替了。</p>
<p>從前，籘轎在故鄉，是唯一的代步者。轎行並不像街車一樣地隨處停歇，牠有固定的店面，等於日本的洋車，有站頭一樣。而且籘轎的代價相當高昂，非一般人所能享受，較之杭州等處，爬山的籘轎每日以一二元計，相差在十倍以上。故鄉的縣城，穿城僅三里餘，那代價非一元不可。所以籘轎的生意是十分慘淡的，不過公館中拜客，赴宴，尤其是年終謝年，元旦賀喜，都是坐籘轎，以壯瞻觀；轎行里祗要做着幾家公館的特約生意，那就有恃無恐了。</p>
<p>至於轎行的組織：有的是由行主備籘轎若干乘，僱傭轎夫，按月給工資若干，很少做拆賬性質的。有的是幾個人備了乘籘轎，大家是老闆，平均做生意。後者的進益更好，因為開消簡省，而且做生意認真。他們雖然沒有幫規，界限却分得非常清楚，某轎行或某幾個人做某公館生意的，非有特殊情形，决不搶奪。到轎行里去要籘轎，祗要認得那個僕人　某家公館里的，卽使做那家生意的轎夫偶然不在行里，同伴也會設法去招呼他們。他們那樣地各不相犯，自然因為進欵好，轎夫們都是停留在轎行附近的茶館里撩天，打牌。在二三月里，剛做過新年的生意，轎夫們賭起錢來也很可觀的。</p>
<p>公館里自備籘轎的並不多，都是做過一任小官，或在相當有身份的。前者是要搭架子，而且那乘籘轎總　上遺留下來的，祗要常僱兩名轎夫在家里，亦有以打　　的兼職，呼喝過市的時候總覺較轎行里叫來的威嚇，—這近乎上海洋車和包車的　別。後者必是鄉紳之類，他們公事多，進出忙，自備籘轎旣便利，開消又省。這兩種籘轎，在街上路人大都認得出是某家的。第三種輪到太夫了，（故鄉從前是沒有醫生的）他們不但自備籘轎，轎夫更由兩名而增至三名。普通籘轎以安步當車為漂亮，坐轎的人撫着轎前的　手板，身體微微向前，頭部探出在轎門之外，遇到熟人，互相招呼，態度是莊嚴而自然。　夫的籘轎就不　，一個轎夫在前面開道，嘴里高聲吆喝着，招呼　人讓路，後面兩名轎夫就健步　　　追隨着，那大夫坐在轎里就　得十分得意了。他們的意思是看病如救火，要愈快愈好；至於用三名轎夫，那表示這大夫的出診忙，兩名轎夫恐怕沒有休息的時候，就　備一名作為預備軍了。寫到這裏，我記起一個笑話，而且是實事，故鄉的父老輩大都能夠詳詳細細講述的。在若干年前，一位大夫掛牌之後，沒有生意，他就異想天開發明了坐籘轎的廣告術，他每天坐了籘轎，大街小巷亂跑，以示他的忙於診務。但是故鄉地面小，他的籘轎祗見滿街飛，却不見在人家門前停歇，他的西洋鏡終於穿拆了。</p>
<p>自從三年前故鄉的建設局拆平橋樑，修築馬路之後，不知怎樣一來，通行洋車了。洋車通行之後，自然轎行都受了打擊，紛紛倒閉。起初由人包辦洋車一百輛，劃定了多少站頭，大有求過於供的樣子。拉車子的人就是由哪些轎夫改行的，他們雖然覺得沒有做轎夫時的舒服，進欵却增加。因為籘轎是要二人分拆的，洋車就獨自進益，定價比籘轎賤，坐的人就多，車租是論月的，自然比之上海論日的要便宜許多。這樣，一般農忙過後的莊稼人，及每日徘徊於茶館的小販，都想來搶吃這碗飯了。利之所在，人皆爭之，包辦洋車的亦分頭鑚營，於是××洋車行××洋車行都開起來，車輛由一百二百而五百，現在馬路兩旁的兩列洋車，像金蒼蠅似的不知有多少輛了。</p>
<p>火車駛進站，車廂是吐出寥寥的幾個乘客，但是走到木柵收票處，團團的被車夫圍上了：叫着，喊着，你幾乎懷疑在什麽碼頭上岸，一不留意，或許你的行李已被人搶去了，不過這是搶生意，祗要必去坐上他的車，什麽都不會短少的。如果有兩隻手搶着你的行李時，那就得費一番周折了，因為他們有的是功夫，能夠許久堅持着不放手，你這個行李的主人就祗有站着等他們分勝負。</p>
<h3 id="c170">紅蓼 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>提起秋天的花卉，大家都會想到菊花。可是我却以為菊花之可愛，却遠不及紅蓼。</p>
<p>在有幾點上，菊花的確是可愛的。譬如說罷，菊花不在萬卉爭豔的春天開放，也不在易於生存的夏天開放，却要在風霜將要向萬物施威的當兒開放，這一點的確是菊花的一種值得使人欽佩的優點。此外，菊花的姿態，菊花的色澤，以及菊花的香味，都足以使人得到愉快的心情，而曾加以愛護的。</p>
<p>然而紅蓼之可愛，却也不遜於菊花。她雖然沒有菊花那種富麗的花朵，她雖然沒有菊花那種會人目迷的色澤，但她那種亭亭玉立，俯仰宜人的姿態，和她那種紅白相間，纖細玲瓏的花朵却也能使人生出快感的。</p>
<p>不但如此，紅蓼却另有比菊花可貴之處。當我們看見菊花的時候，我們好像看見一個在脂粉培養中的都市摩登姑娘一樣，而紅蓼呢，却像一個生活在鄉村裏的健美少女一般。前者會裝出嬌媚的姿態，逼人憐愛；後者却能用她天賦的性情，天真　實地使人自然而然地被她感動。逼出來的憐愛是虛偽的，自然的感動才是純潔的。</p>
<p>紅蓼雖有着這種可愛之處，但却被人忽視了。她不被培養在精緻的花盆裏，不被供奉在精雅的几案上。沒有美女把她插在鬢上，沒有人為她開欣賞大會。人們對她只有淡漠的態度。因此她只能躲在池角河邊，陪着失羣的孤雁長啼，隨着秋風飲泣。</p>
<p>然而，這也許就是紅蓼的幸運吧，她能夠在自然界中保持着她自然的性情。卽使這不是她的幸運。却也不值得使我們為她憐惜的。世界上那一件事不是如此的呢。虛偽的嬌作的，被人擁護着了，天真的自然的，却被埋沒在草莽之間。</p>

<h3 id="c181">狄塞爾客車之誕生 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>克明高率內燃機器公司。製造狄塞爾引擎客車之企圖。近吿成功。於是首創出品紀錄之榮譽。遂歸諸該公司及其當局克明氏焉。按此項客車。係採用奧奔八缸之底盤而配成者。除狄塞爾引擎外。其他一仍舊觀。卽引擎之裝置地位。亦無絲毫更動之處。關於出品之價目及其推銷之計劃。迄今尙未有所聞。</p>
<p>燃料簡省　消息露佈之日。克明氏卽親駕其第一輛出品。自紐約直駛太平洋濱。作一度經濟行程。預料此行所需燃料。當不致超過美金八元云。至引擎所用重油。極便採購。蓋村戶使用油燃機者。固在所皆是也。油價則各地不同。每加侖自美金三分起至一角不等。其平均價格約為美金六分。惟有地或須附徵國稅者。其售價自較此有加焉。普通用戶。每加侖當可行車四十至五十英里。燃料消費之程度。要視速率為轉移。</p>
<p>速率激增　克明氏對於狄塞爾客車之信仰。數年如一日。未嘗稍變初衷。茲今犬功吿成。客車製造業遂獲得一新園地。豈特克明氏之主張得以貫澈已也。夫克明公司製造狄塞爾引擎之歷史。遠始於一九一九年。最初出品。僅為定置及航用狄塞爾引擎。嗣後貨車。公共汽車及有軌車輛所用之狄塞爾引擎。陸續出而問世。今日卽以其所出貨車用狄塞爾引擎一項而論。其經人採用者。為數達一千具以上云。</p>
<p>一九三〇年三月。克明氏在台托那以克明航用狄塞爾引擎裝置於四缸派卡車。造成每小時八〇·三九八英里之速率。首創狄塞爾第一次之正式紀錄。為世人所注意。一九三一年複至台托那。造成每小時一〇〇·七五英里之新紀錄。逮本年初。別爾克明氏在台托那突破各項紀錄。而造成每小時一三七·一九九英里之最高狄塞爾速率也。至參加印第阿那卜立士車賽者。則一九三一年有伊文思氏。以每小時八六·一七〇英里之速率。名列十三。一九二四年復有已故司得勃爾飛氏。以每小時八八·五六六英里之速率。名列十二。此二氏所用之車。皆裝置克明狄塞爾引擎者也。</p>
<p>不甚靈活　此次克明氏作橫貫美洲之舉。記者曾陪末座。且為駕駛佛及尼亞境內。自拉新登至白色弗泉之一段路程。計長七二英里。查該種高壓機幷不如汽油機之靈活。卽其動力亦較小。雖將高度齒輪比率之直接傳動改為四，〇〇〇與一，〇〇之比。其離心傳動改為二，六五與一之比。猶不能與奧奔之動力並駕齊驅。標準齒率。其前項為四，三〇。其後項則為三，二〇。車行最高速率。未遑計出。然每小時行六十五里。固游刃有餘也。人立車後。常可嗅得一股油氣。身在車中。則細毫不之覺耳。</p>
<p>引擎係六缸頭上汽門式。有長推桿以升降汽門及活梢。其內徑及衝程為三，七五曁五英寸。活塞排汽量為三三一，四方寸。據謂可產生八五匹馬力。其速率為每分鐘二二〇〇轉云。至奧奔之原用引擎。其馬力亦為八五匹。特其速率則為每分鐘三五〇〇轉也，</p>
<p>重量减輕　狄塞爾引擎莫不認為笨重者也。乃克明狄塞個引擎之總重量。不過八六〇磅。較之奧奔八缸車之汽油引擎僅加重八〇磅耳。其所以致輕之原因。約有二端。一旦設計之周密。一曰汽缸座及汽缸蓋之改　鋁合金屬是也。活動之汽缸連。則為鑄鐵所造。設能將限速器及注射器之外層鑄鐵改為鋁合金屬。則當可再為减輕二十至三十磅之重量焉。</p>
<p>吾人希望狄塞爾引擎之重量竟能減低至與汽油引擎者相等。是亦非不能達到目的者。然不可不知者。則其速率雖較低。而其活塞排汽量竟較奧奔之二七九，九方寸為尤大。乃為三三一，四方寸。故克明全車重量較之本來面目之奧奔車加重二五〇磅者。因須裝置巨型之始動機。蓄電池。及發電機等實爲其最大之原因。</p>
<p>需用强力始動機　此項狄塞爾引擎具有五百磅之壓縮力。故需用一有力之始動機。於是其蓄電池及發動機。亦不得不採用巨重者。全體機構以十二伏脫運用之。發電機為二二五瓦特者。較諸其他客車所用者幾大一倍也。活塞為鋁合金製。</p>
<p>另一訊息　據印第亞那卜立士發表消息。美國首批裝置狄塞爾引擎之客車。在數月內卽可發賣。該項車輛。為考特汽車公司出品。係採用哥侖布市克明機器公司所造之狄塞爾引擎而裝置於奧奔車身者。至其是否尙足推銷國外。刻尙不得而知。狄塞爾引擎。用汕之省。世所公認。但目前該項引擎能否滴用於客車。則言人人殊。各執一詞國。初不料考特公司竟於爭諭聲中。毅然着手進行焉。惟據通用汽車之司副總裁史龍氏最近發表意見。則謂該項引擎目前尙不堪使用於客車云。</p>

<p>星期日晨八時四十五分，由杭出發，擬渡離杭四英里之錢塘江，但不久卽遭遇第三次之阻碍，因得訊對江渡橋業已中斷，此種消息殊令我等愕異，因是晨余儕固曾向中國旅行社及浙省公路局，探詢此途之能否通行也，余等重返杭州，於上午十時離武林門車站，速度表為五·二五五英里，以天目山為目的地，自車站出發，沿經昌化而至徽州之大道前進，行三十英里，見一古石橋，橫架淸溪之上，景色殊佳，値得一觀，在老樹濃蔭下溪水中一沿後，於上午十一院三十分出發赴臨安，速度表之里程紀錄為五，二八八英里，午十二時十五分見入山之歧路橫斷於前，自武林門車站至此，為程計四十八英里，轉舵向右，入支路行十二英里，經一景色絕佳之山徑，卽抵一站，旅客至此可棄車步行，約半英里後，卽達山脚之天茂旅館，其地位卽在天目山麓之山谷中，殊覺幽靜也，此旅館正改名為天目山旅館，內中設備殊為新式，由滬而往，為程亦不甚遠，凡喜山居之幽靜，淸泉之悅耳，以及作爬山運動者，此處實為至佳之遊息區，凡屬中國汽車俱樂部之會所，該旅館又給予九折之優待。</p>
<p>在山中遇此行首次之雨，濛迷罩籠，山景為之隔絕，否則山高四千餘尺，仰觀俯視，均有足以賞心悅目者也，天目山之特色，除樅樹奇木之外，復多叢竹，與一路所見之山相較，逈乎有異，由山麓爬行兩小時，卽達山巔之寺廟，沿途景色頗値一觀，凡足力不健者，可僱山轎而行，殊為優適。</p>
<p>余等最初之旅行目的地，為經錢塘江而至黃山，再經由溫州　至雁　山，惜因中途發生阻碍，不能依原定計劃行，乃在天且山勾留一口又半，星期三上午十時四十五分，離天目山附近之汽車站，以平均每小時二十七英里之速率，抵達杭州城郊，速率表之記錄為五，三六七英里，武林門公共汽車站於午十二時半到達，里程為五·三七三英里·使用第五十加侖之汽油時，余儕山離杭返滬，為程計一百三十三英里，中途除暫息四十分鐘外，於下午五時半抵達上海，凡欲往浙省作汽車旅行者，所應加注意者，卽此文寫作時，浙南因杭州對江錢江南渡橋中斷，未　通行汽車，　溪之南路其亦被水冲毀，浙西至皖之道路，亦因塌坍而不通，其地點在淳安他端十七英里處也。</p>

<p>Matters for Discussion (1) Review Report of the Constitution of the Republic of China Draft Review Committee. The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China was submitted for review and the meeting was convened at 8:00 AM on the 3rd of this month in the first conference room. A total of forty-seven review committee members and participants Fu Bingchang, Tao Luqian, Wu Jingxiong, and Lin Bin, attended. After discussion by the General Assembly, it was deemed necessary to appoint additional committee members to conduct a preliminary review. Immediately, Ye Chucang, Chen Bulei, Gan Naiguang, Luo Jialun, and Liang Hancao, five committee members, and Fu Bingchang and Wu Jingxiong, two comrades, were appointed to convene a small group review meeting. They consolidated the opinions expressed by the various committee members to form a report for further discussion. The small group review meeting was held at 2:30 PM that afternoon in the third review room. After detailed discussion, review opinions were drafted. This committee convened a second review meeting at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th in the first conference room. A total of thirty-three committee members, including Ju Zheng, and participants Wu Jingxiong, Lin Bin, Fu Bingchang, and Wang Shijie, attended. The review opinions drafted by the small group review meeting were revised and approved. If there is any inadequacy, we respectfully await public decision. Review opinions: 1. The colleagues of this committee believe that the recently revised draft constitution by the Legislative Yuan is generally appropriate. However, to adapt to the current situation and facilitate implementation, it seems that there should be a sufficient period for detailed research and discussion. However, the National Congress is approaching soon, and the session of the National Congress is very short, so there may not be enough time for detailed discussions of each article for a final decision. Therefore, it is proposed that the Sixth Plenary Session, based on the above reasons, together with this draft constitution, be sent to the Fifth National Congress, requesting that the date of announcing the draft constitution and convening the National Assembly be decided first, and that a general review of this draft be conducted, indicating the guiding principles, and then authorizing the next Central Executive Committee for a more extended period of meticulous discussion before submitting it to the National Assembly for resolution and promulgation. 2.

<h3 id="e3">On the New Currency Policy of Our Country, the United States Expresses its Willingness to Provide Indirect Assistance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Abide by Promises, Avoid Obstructive Actions, Strive for Prudence in Silver Purchase Procedures</p>
<p>(Washington) A senior expert here stated today that one of the most noteworthy points of China's recent currency policy is that it has effectively joined the expanding sterling area. Although it is recognized here that the Chinese currency is not directly linked to the pound sterling, it is believed that the only effective place for China to maintain exchange rate equilibrium under the new system is London. Therefore, the Chinese currency should naturally fall under the influence of the pound sterling. The Treasury Department is unwilling to criticize China's new currency policy, but stated that the decision has nothing to do with the United States. The State Department is also unwilling to indicate whether it will advise American expatriates in China to cooperate with the Chinese government. However, observers believe that the State Department will at least cooperate indirectly. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Responsible parties here stated today that the future silver purchase policy of the United States will be implemented in a way that strives to avoid hindering the Chinese government's recent efforts to stabilize the currency, and stated that this is a continuation of the previous promise made by the United States to China. However, China now has stronger control over the currency value, so this promise is even more important. Treasury experts explained the government's attitude, saying that this means that the United States will maintain a relatively stable silver price at least until the silver-faction congressmen return here for the congressional session in January of next year. It is generally believed that the United States' silver purchase procedures in recent months have been very prudent, and have also been a fundamental component of encouraging China to take its recent steps. Now that China is embarking on currency reform, the United States is naturally unwilling to disrupt world silver prices. Silver-faction congressmen in Congress are now divided in opinion and most are not in the capital, so there are no obstacles to any government facilities. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of China's currency reform, a spokesman for the Treasury Department recently stated that although the currency measures adopted by the Chinese government, such as the establishment of a central reserve bank, are quite in line with the recommendations of Sir Leith-Ross, advisor to the British Treasury Department, they are primarily from the creativity of the Chinese government. This move was actually forced by the Chinese government due to the financial and monetary situation, so it was unavoidable. As for the exchange rate set for the Chinese currency, it was definitely not recommended by Sir Leith-Ross. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">US Silver Faction Expresses Opinions <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(San Francisco) Senator Thomas, leader of the US Senate's inflationary faction, claimed today that China's reason for abandoning the silver standard is just like the US abandoning the gold standard. The Chinese government saw that the price of silver was soaring, so it decided to nationalize silver and distribute its profits to the public, rather than allowing speculators to enjoy it alone. Thomas has announced that he now believes the United States should also adopt a currency management plan, and said that all countries in the world except France and a few other European countries are now taking currency management systems, so he sees China's move as the last step in world currency stabilization, but the period of stabilization is not yet in sight. Thomas hopes that after world currency stabilization, the gold and silver bimetallic standard can be adopted. Although whether the Chinese government can profit depends entirely on the future price of silver, he firmly believes that China will definitely profit. The United States also wants to raise the price of silver and has the power to control the price of silver. The current amount of silver in the world is about 1 trillion ounces, of which the United States accounts for 120 billion, India 450 billion, and China 250 billion. If the price of silver rises, China and the United States will benefit, and the United States has more than enough power to absorb the world's gold and silver. Thomas also mentioned the US silver purchase policy, saying that the Treasury Department still needs to purchase 100 billion ounces to meet the ratio of three parts gold to one part silver. Now that China has nationalized silver, it is expected that the world price of silver will rise again. Before the nationalization of silver, the industrialists and bankers in China were unwilling for the price of silver to rise, because their manufacturing costs would increase accordingly, and the value of their debt collateral would decrease accordingly. However, after the implementation of currency management, the Chinese government will control its domestic currency value and avoid being controlled by foreigners. As for the future of international currency or war, Thomas believes that after most countries implement currency management, this may be unavoidable. Someone asked Thomas about Senator Pittman's opinion that the price of silver will reach $1.29 within 18 months. Thomas said that it does not need 18 months. If the price of silver can reach this height, it will be before the next US general election. If the government cannot follow public opinion and raise the price of silver before the election, then it will not be implemented later. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Key Pittman, leader of the silver faction, told reporters today that China nationalized silver because the price of silver per ounce will rise to $1.29 within 18 months. When asked about his thoughts on the Chinese government's silver policy, Pittman replied that China's move is a matter of course. If you hoard goods worth 65 cents per ounce that will rise to $1.29 in a short period of time, then you will definitely not want to sell them until the price reaches that point. He also said that China only has two paths to follow: cancel the silver export tax and restore market freedom, or nationalize silver. China is now taking the latter, because as the world price of silver increases, private trafficking will become more active, and the trend will not stop until all silver is exhausted. Pittman also said that the Chinese government's move has no impact on the US silver policy. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Financial District Quietly Observes Policy Effectiveness <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(New York) American bankers and the foreign exchange community have little criticism of the Chinese government's currency reform move, because they want to wait and see what happens next. The general opinion is that this move by the Chinese government is mostly the result of the US silver purchase policy. At present, silver in the United States and the Far East exchange market have not been greatly affected. The general impression is that this move by China cannot be called currency. People in the silver industry generally believe that this move by China will eventually be a factor that is beneficial to the silver market. It is expected that under the force of restricting silver exports, the silver market can turn firm. The general opinion is that the final result of the plan to use paper money is unpredictable, because the development of the Chinese currency system is not as easy to predict as the currency systems of Western countries. According to news from Washington, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Undersecretary Coolidge are both out of town, so the Treasury Department has not yet made a formal criticism of this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(New York) After the Chinese government nationalized silver, financial authorities here believe that the situation in the world silver market is quite uncertain. China will not throw out silver, causing India to become the main purchasing market for the United States. However, some experts still believe that China may be willing to sell a large amount of silver to bring the Chinese currency closer to the normal level of exchange.

<p>(London) The US Treasury Department did not purchase silver in London today, which is something that has not happened for a long time. India and speculators bought in, so the price of silver rose by 1.875, but the US authorities were unwilling to buy when the price rose. Although China sold some, the supply was not large. The actions of India and speculators almost expected that the Chinese government's decision to nationalize silver would cause silver sales to drop sharply. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Beijing Organizes a Price Evaluation Committee <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Advising Citizens to Assist in Consolidating Finance; Subsidiary Coin Prices Follow Shanghai Regulations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Finance implemented currency management, prices in Beijing rose slightly. Copper coins rose by one-tenth. The municipal authorities invited representatives from relevant agencies, silver coin firms, chambers of commerce, and various trade associations to a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss ways to stabilize the social economy. In addition to Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhuo, and Ma Chaojun jointly issuing a notice advising citizens to assist in consolidating finance, it was resolved to organize a temporary price evaluation committee immediately. At the meeting of representatives from various relevant agencies and trades at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Wang Shufang, Chen Jianru, and Lu Zhaoqiang, were present. They believed that after the implementation of the currency policy, the general public did not understand it deeply, and prices in Beijing were gradually rising, so it was necessary to stabilize market prices. Chen Changru, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the general situation of the sudden increase in prices. Wu Zhenxiu of the Banking Association stated that the increase in prices was a temporary transitional situation, completely related to supply and demand. You Zhusheng of the Money Industry Association reported on the market price of subsidiary coin exchange. Zeng Gexian of the Chamber of Commerce stated the general business situation in the business community. After discussion, (1) The prices of subsidiary coins should be based on the Shanghai regulations and should not be increased or decreased (according to Shanghai regulations, each standard currency of one yuan is only allowed to be exchanged for 12 cents). (2) Regarding the stabilization of prices, it was decided to organize a temporary evaluation committee, which will be organized by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Department, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (3) The Municipal Party Department will convene a conversation with the heads of various trade associations together with the Social Affairs Bureau, hoping to inform all merchants and citizens, and the mayor and district chiefs of the city will make speeches to convey the same message to all citizens.

<p>(Nanjing) The price of grain in Beijing rose by 20 cents per stone in the morning yesterday, and another 50 cents in the afternoon, for a total increase of 70 cents. The price was slightly lower on the 5th. In addition, flour, coal, and daily necessities have also risen. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that merchants themselves must have a deep understanding in order to stabilize prices. The Chamber has scheduled an emergency meeting of the heads of various trade associations for the afternoon of the 6th to discuss and determine all measures to jointly maintain the stability of the market under the support of the government's policies. (Special dispatch on the 5th) (Nanjing) Wang Shufang stated that the temporary price evaluation committee will be convened and organized by the Social Affairs Bureau today. In the future, the committee's work will be to investigate in detail the prices of daily necessities and to prohibit manipulation and price increases at any time. The municipal government will cooperate with various agencies to carry out this work. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Kong Xiangxi Explains the Nature of Currency Management <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Neither Currency Inflation Nor Paper Money Policy, Current Price Increases are Temporary Phenomenon, Legal Tender Exchange Period Scheduled to Conclude in Two Years</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi spoke to reporters at noon, stating that the Ministry's announcement is still not fully understood or recognized by the outside world, with some saying "suspension of cash payments" or "abandonment of the silver standard." However, using the notes of the three banks as legal tender is to centralize cash and prepare to stop the use of coins, which is government management of currency to prevent its outflow. The currency standard itself has not changed. People who need cash to purchase foreign goods can still exchange for cash, but the three banks act as agents for buying and selling foreign exchange for the purpose of prevention. Recently, customs authorities have repeatedly reported the outflow of silver, amounting to 200,000 to 300,000 per month. To promote economic recovery and prevent the outflow of cash, this emergency measure was taken. It has been clearly explained in the declaration that stopping the use of coins is neither currency inflation nor a paper money policy. However, the general public does not fully understand. Currency inflation, for example, is when 50,000 yuan of banknotes are issued with a 60% reserve of 30,000 yuan. If 80,000 or 100,000 yuan of paper money is issued with a reserve of 30,000 yuan, that can be called currency inflation. Now that the notes of the three banks have not been additionally issued, it proves that it is not currency inflation. Firstly, the so-called paper money policy is the issuance of paper money without reserves, which is even clearer. Secondly, regarding the outside world's suggestion to have more people's representatives participate in the Legal Tender Reserve Management Committee, the current committee already includes many leaders from the Chamber of Commerce and the silver and money industries, so people's representatives are already participating. The government's order to crack down on price gouging is being implemented. The theory of manipulating the quantity of money to prevent price increases, as suggested by a certain expert, is not currently needed. Generally, if the quantity of money increases, prices will also rise accordingly. If the quantity of money decreases, prices will also fall accordingly. Since there has not been much increase in the quantity of money now, prices cannot rise. The current phenomenon, if any, is due to temporary stimulus and will still tend to stabilize. The deadline for all cash exchanges and the exchange of banknotes issued by various banks for legal tender is set at two years. As for the cash coins held by the people, legal tender can be exchanged and used at locations of the three banks where they are not yet established, tax collection agencies, state-owned enterprises, "telegraph bureaus, railway bureaus, China Merchants Bureau, and local county governments, etc., and orders have been issued for compliance. The Central Bank was originally a bank for banks, but is now reorganized into the Central Reserve Bank, which is truly implementing a bank for banks. Everything is prepared and can be submitted for approval and implementation. As for the content of the amendment to the Real Estate Mortgage Law, it is in view of the fact that people in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, who invest in real estate face lawsuits in court due to tenants defaulting on rent. Tenants often refuse to comply and repeatedly appeal, making it impossible to mortgage real estate. Therefore, it is proposed to amend provisions that conflict with the Real Estate Mortgage Law to promote the vitality of real estate, the flow of finance, and to protect the legal rights of investors. Regarding foreign exchange, the three banks are now buying and selling as much as possible, and the three banks will set the buying and selling standard based on supply and demand. Therefore, foreign exchange can tend to be balanced and stable. As for staple foods such as rice and wheat, the government will definitely control them when necessary to regulate the people's food supply. However, this rice price increase was caused by rumors in the Shanghai market. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 5th to attend the plenary session and report on the situation in various areas after the implementation of the new monetary policy. According to his conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency, this new monetary policy is indeed the only good way to stop the outflow of resources and safeguard the nation's economic lifeline. However, this method is neither a suspension of cash payments nor an abandonment of the silver standard, because the Tuen-yang Mint is still minting coins to supplement the legal tender reserve. People who need spot goods for foreign trade can buy and sell foreign exchange from the three banks with currency. Also, the government's legal tender issuance reserve is still based on silver. Therefore, the external rumors are all wrong. The new policy is merely the suspension of the use of coins in the market. Moreover, the exchange rate of legal tender to British currency is the same as that of silver coins. As for the Reserve Management Committee, people's representatives have been included as much as possible. The issuance of legal tender under the new policy still requires full reserves and is not an unlimited issuance. Therefore, it is neither currency inflation nor a paper money policy, but rather the implementation of currency management. After the announcement of the new policy, the price increase is a temporary and natural stimulus. If it is excessive, the government will use political force or other means to stop and crack down on it. Although the deadline for the exchange of silver for legal tender has not been specified, since people have no need to keep silver coins and urgently need legal tender, it is expected that it can be recovered soon. Also, the banknotes of the three banks have not been limited for recall and can be used as usual. The Central Bank substantively already has all the rights and obligations of a Central Reserve Bank. It is expected that the Central Bank will exclusively enjoy the right to issue banknotes in two years. The Real Estate Mortgage Law currently in effect, which conflicts with protecting people's interests and hinders financial circulation, will be amended. Kong also hopes that the press will fully explain and interpret the new policy. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Maturation of the Greek Restoration Movement <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>General Theodoros Kolokotronis, a leader of the 19th-century Greek independence movement, once said, "Greece cannot survive without a monarch." The current Greek statesman Panagis Tsaldaris was one of the drafters of the 1924 Geneva Protocol and is currently the ambassador to France. He recently also served as an arbitrator for the Arbitral Tribunal. In an opinion published in an Athens newspaper, he also stated, "A constitutional monarchy is far superior to a democratic autocracy." It can be seen that the Greek nation's inclination towards the imperial system is deep and long-standing. This restoration movement, within the ruling class, has been carefully arranged for a long time. The referendum held on the 3rd under military control was merely a formality. According to recent dispatches, the total vote count showed that those in favor of restoring the imperial system numbered 1,501,992 votes against 33,360 votes, accounting for the vast majority. It is indeed what was expected.</p>
<p>The Greek Republic was declared on May 1, 1925. This revolution was in fact a result of the defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign. After the European War, Greece, supported by the Allied forces of Britain and France, attempted to annex Smyrna, which it had coveted for a long time. However, due to the heroic resistance of the Turkish national hero Kemal Atatürk, it suffered a major defeat in Asia Minor. Subsequently, domestic coups followed one after another. King Constantine was forced to abdicate for the second time on January 11, 1923. George II succeeded him, but was soon deposed by the parliament on December 17 of the same year. On March 25, 1925, the parliament passed a resolution to overthrow the imperial system and establish a republic. On April 13, a national referendum approved the change of system with 758,742 votes against 325,322 votes. The official announcement of the change of system was made on May 1, and it has been only ten and a half years since then.</p>
<p>There are three major political parties in Greece, namely the Republican Party, the Imperial Party, and the Social Communist Party. The Republican Party is led by Eleftherios Venizelos and is based on the island of Crete. Venizelos is one of the great modern Greek politicians, having guided Greek affairs for twenty years. The current Kontylis, who is most strongly advocating for the restoration, was originally also affiliated with the Republican Party. The Imperial Party is divided into extremist and moderate factions. The former Prime Minister Tsaldaris is the leader of the moderate faction. The Republican Party also has considerable influence in the army and navy. Seeing the imperial trend becoming more and more intensified, they joined forces with the Social Communists on March 1 of this year to launch an uprising to make a final defense of the republican system. However, it was only a flash in the pan, and Eleftherios Venizelos, in his declining years, fled to Paris. After this, Kontylis very much wanted to restore the monarchy in one fell swoop. However, Tsaldaris, as Prime Minister, was unwilling to act rashly on the change of the national system. George II was also quite cautious about his own position. Therefore, even after the two political upheavals of July 19 and October 10, Kontylis still had to decide this important political system issue through a public referendum. Now that the results of the referendum are like this, the Imperial Party can get what they want.</p>
<p>However, this small country with a population of 6.6 million has had several cases of its monarchs being deposed and assassinated in the past hundred years, according to historical records. Since the collapse of the imperial system in 1924, the intensity of party strife has also been constantly reported. It can be seen that whether it is an imperial system or a democracy, it is difficult for Greece to achieve long-term stability and security. Moreover, the power of the Eleftherios Venizelos faction still has residual strength to be exploited, and George II, who is currently residing in London, even among those in the Imperial Party, may have disagreements about his return to power.</p>

<p>Athens After the results of the Greek referendum determined support for the restoration, political figures here believe that the political situation is unlikely to change before King George returns from England. Former Prime Minister Tsaldaris, leader of the People's Party, recently issued a declaration stating that although the people have voted in favor of the restoration, politicians are not allowed to use the opportunity to pursue their own selfish gains. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens It was officially announced here today that the total vote on Sunday showed 1,501,992 votes in favor of a constitutional monarchy and 33,360 votes against. General Kondylis, the Regent, today had the Greek cabinet swear allegiance in the name of George II. George II will soon return from London to ascend the throne. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Athens King George recently issued a proclamation to the Greek people from England, stating, "By divine decree and the will of the people, I have resumed the throne. From now on, I shall take the national constitution as my guide. I hope that all levels of the nation will work together to make our motherland prosperous and happy." Also, news has it that King George will return home via Yugoslavia. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After the news of the Greek referendum results, which showed a majority in favor of the former king's restoration, reached here, the Austrian Imperial Party unanimously rejoiced. They feel that they will soon be able to force former Prime Minister Starhemberg to clearly express his opinion on the restoration of Archduke Otto. Fischer, who was recently squeezed out by Starhemberg, delivered a speech to 8,000 imperialists today, demanding that the Habsburg imperial family return home as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e13">Border Conflict Incident; Russian Ambassador Refutes Japanese Dispatch, Accusing Japanese and Puppet Troops of Provoking Across the Border <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian ambassador to Japan today sent a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, stating that the Japanese claim that the border incidents on October 6 and 12 were caused by illegal activities of Soviet border guards is completely unfounded, and claiming that Japanese "Manchu" mixed troops illegally invaded Russian territory and attacked Russian troops, causing the conflict. The Russian and Japanese sides have different opinions on this conflict. After the incident occurred, the Russian authorities immediately protested, claiming that 50 Japanese and Manchu troops crossed the border at Grodekovo, near Khabarovsk, and opened fire on Russian soldiers, who then returned fire, resulting in several deaths and injuries. According to the Japanese explanation, on October 6, 15 miles west of Nov Alekseevskoye, a Manchu infantry patrol encountered six Russian cavalrymen in Manchu territory. The Russian cavalrymen refused to be questioned and opened fire, and the Manchu troops returned fire. The Russian cavalrymen then retreated, and the Manchu troops chased them to the border, seizing a horse. They then inspected the area and found that the Russian side had built a temporary bridge to facilitate the movement of their cavalry. On October 12, the Manchu side sent some soldiers to investigate. At 3 p.m. that day, they encountered 50 Russian cavalrymen with machine guns and bombs in the area. The Russian cavalrymen also opened fire, attempting to surround the Manchu troops. The two sides therefore fought each other, but the number of deaths and injuries is still unknown.

<h3 id="e14">The Italian Offensive in the Northern Front Suddenly Comes to a Halt <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Rain Makes Military Operations Difficult; Twenty-One Mules Have Difficulty Pulling One Cannon; Italy Implements Austerity Measures</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the authorities here announced that the general offensive that began on Sunday on the entire northern front has now stopped to complete the construction of the roads. It is reported that the Italian First Army Corps, which advanced from Maruk yesterday, has now reached the territory of Meaine and occupied the village of Adibahei. Two columns of Italian troops and native legions are said to have occupied Hoshan, and another column has set off from the Danakil lowlands and advanced to the Dagu River basin, occupying the eastern defenses of Agam. A telegram received today from Asmara stated that the Italian troops in the northern front are currently holding and controlling the lines of communication to the mountain valleys of Agra and Suro. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara The Italian troops in the northern front have now advanced to a location 20 miles from Mek'ele. It is expected that after the vanguard troops occupy their destination tonight, they will wait for the arrival of the main forces and set up a new alert formation, which will be 40 to 50 miles further than the Adowa line. It is not the rainy season now, but the weather is abnormal, with continuous rain for days. The Italian troops have to advance in the rain. The mud is terrible, and the difficulty of the march can be imagined. In one place, 21 mules were not enough to drag a cannon over the rocks. The forward commanders of the Italian army are now afraid that the rain will wash away the military road behind them, causing the forward troops to be disconnected from the Adowa headquarters. Air reconnaissance reports that the Ethiopian troops have turned south, which proves that they do not want to resist the Italian army at this time. Therefore, based on the current situation, a major battle is unlikely to occur this month. The troops in the Danakil front are now advancing rapidly to the south and have been in contact with the rear, so there is no danger of an isolated force deep in the enemy's territory. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy is currently carrying out a plan to weaken the effects of League of Nations sanctions. Today, the Fascist Party conference officially decided to encourage rabbit breeding to increase meat supply. The authorities are also collecting scrap iron throughout the country. Trains have reduced their mileage by 6,000 miles per day to save fuel. At the same time, pilots who participated in the 1934 International Air Race have handed over their gold medals to the state for melting. British and American residents in Italy are now sending their families out of the country in droves to prevent food shortages and Italian xenophobia. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government, in order to resist sanctions, has issued an order to the whole country to save consumption. All domestic butcher shops will be closed for the first time today, and it has been decided to close one day per week from now on. In addition, all hotels and dining cars will limit meals to one dish. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Italian Troops Have Not Yet Attacked in the Southern Front; Gorahei Bombed by Italian Planes <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Although those responsible in Addis Ababa claim that the Ethiopian troops will defend the city of Mek'ele to the last man, people here all believe that the city will fall soon. According to news from Asmara, Italian planes flew over the sky above Mek'ele yesterday and saw white flags everywhere. This can be regarded as a signal that Italian troops have occupied the city. The Ethiopian troops in the city seem to have begun to retreat. The only Ethiopian soldiers seen by Italian planes nearby were a force of about 3,000 men advancing towards Mek'ele last night. The Italian troops currently attacking Mek'ele total at least three armies. One army is attacking head-on from Adigrat, and the remaining two armies are advancing from the holy cities of Adowa and Aksum, both from the southwest. A column of the First Army Corps, commanded by General Santini, has advanced to Agula, about 15 miles from Mek'ele, with its outposts stationed on the other side of the valley that almost overlooks Mek'ele. Heavy rain fell at night, turning the roads near Mek'ele into a mire. At the same time, the main target of the Italian troops in the southern front, Harar, initially appeared to be the site of a major battle last night, but according to reliable frontline news, the Italian troops' fierce attack has not yet begun, but is imminent. It is widely believed that the large army commanded by General Graziani now has Gorahei as its target. According to unofficial sources, the army has about 50 tanks to assist in the battle. Although the Ethiopian troops have dug trenches near Gorahei to defend themselves, it is feared that it will be difficult to withstand the combined attack of tanks, planes, and infantry. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Our special correspondent Ouchena reports that Italian troops have been bombing the town of Gorahei for days with planes. The town is an important town in the Wardagai region, rich in water sources, and is also a major transportation hub. Therefore, many civilians in the town have been killed and injured by bombs. There are very few Ethiopian troops stationed in Gorahei town. The Ethiopian government is very puzzled as to what the purpose is of Italian planes repeatedly bombing the town. Some people believe that the Italian troops' target may be the Ethiopian residents. Also, the Italian troops have resumed their attack on the city of Mek'ele on the northern front. No news has been received here, but it is heard that native soldiers from Italian Eritrea are still fleeing in large numbers. Therefore, the strength of the troops led by General Wondirad, the Commander-in-Chief of Tigray Province, who are currently stationed south of Adowa, has greatly increased. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) A dispatch from the Italian front today stated that Italian bombers bombed the enemy army in advance and discovered 10,000 Ethiopian troops advancing north towards Mek'ele. As the Italian troops advanced south, they encountered resistance along the way and have now occupied most of the villages. Observers today generally believe that after occupying their destination, the Italian troops will need about a month to reorganize their defenses before launching another attack.

<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin recently delivered a campaign speech to over 5,000 people, discussing domestic affairs and economic policies, and paying particular attention to the cotton weaving industry in Lancashire and the Liverpool port commerce. Finally, he mentioned foreign affairs and defended the policies adopted by the government, saying, "We ask the people to trust us so that we can continue our work and be creators of a new Britain. If God blesses us, we also hope to reform Europe. My political opponents accuse the government of being self-satisfied with all its measures. It must be known that the government is not like this. We have a very deep understanding of the responsibilities we bear and the responsibilities that our political opponents avoid. I dare say that our work has had good plans from the beginning, and I hope that future achievements can also be comparable." Baldwin also said, "What Europe needs is a strong and experienced British government so that it can assist other governments when necessary. However, there is a pleasing thing now, that is, the League of Nations can deal with major events that stimulate world opinion in a lively and vigorous manner, making those who intend to destroy it discouraged and opening a bright future for the collective security system. I believe that there is indeed a strong and firm desire for peace in Europe. This can be seen in the fact that the League of Nations Adjustment Committee passed a proposal without our initiative, entrusting Britain and France to do their best to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute in order to find a solution that can satisfy the League of Nations and Italy. Even if we cannot eliminate the war before it happens, we should not be afraid of difficulties and end the war as soon as possible. This solution should be within the scope of the League of Nations. If it can be found, all human beings will be honored. All member states should have this feeling, and how can our Britain be outside of this?" (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

Acting Secretary of State Phillips stated that the United States has not officially been informed of the request to prohibit the shipment of iron, coal, steel, and oil to Italy, and expressed doubt about the suggestion that the United States will be consulted, as it is questionable whether the President has the authority to block various goods under the Neutrality Act. However, it is believed that representatives from certain major powers may informally seek the United States' opinion on behalf of the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Words on Locusts' Backs Indicate a World War is Coming <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>This omen appeared before the Spanish-American War and World War I.</p>
<p>Strange discovery by American veterans</p>
<p>World Society, Bristol (Oklahoma, USA) - According to Edward Maurice, a veteran of the Spanish-American War who is now a local resident, a world war will soon break out. His reason is that locusts have recently been found in the local countryside with the English letter "W" naturally formed on their backs, which is an abbreviation for "War". He said that he had seen locusts with the same appearance on their backs before the Spanish-American War and World War I. He also said that if there was only one "W", it would not be so bad, but unfortunately there is a small circle below the letter, which indicates that the war will spread throughout the world.</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Attitude of the Italian People Towards the East African War <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Tiesheng</p>
<p>The Italian Blackshirt Prime Minister Mussolini once roared like a lion: "I would rather be a lion for one day than a sheep for a hundred years." Therefore, he disregards everything and desperately "ventures" into Africa. On the surface, he takes "civilizing the black race" as his responsibility, but in reality he "wants to turn Abyssinia into Italy's Morocco." In this way, he can not only enable three million Italians to immigrate to Africa, but also extend the work of Italians civilizing blacks for at least fifty years.</p>
<p>Do the British want to sanction the Italians? "The meaning of sanctions is war," is Gada's reply. Do the British want to block the Suez Canal? "Italy will resist them with all its might on land, sea, and air," is Mussolini's reply. The recent meeting of the Italian cabinet in Bolsano also took the same stance.</p>
<p>We can get a glimpse of the Italian authorities' attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian War from this. But what is the attitude of the Italian people? This is also a question that we must pay attention to. Naturally, we cannot find a real answer to this question in the Italian newspapers.</p>
<p>No matter who it is, if he stays in Italy for a while, he will find that the issue that Italians are most concerned about is the "Abyssinian War." Most of them express disapproval of the war. They hold the view of abhorring war, and many people even think that it is suicide. But there is no public opposition, because Fascism's thirteen years of dictatorial rule has made them afraid to oppose it through obvious or implicit policies of terror.</p>
<p>Of course, nationalism is not without effect among Italians. However, those who embrace nationalism believe that there are other ways to seize "a place in the sun" besides war. Even within the Fascist Party, there are those who criticize it. For the sake of caution, they naturally do not dare to criticize it publicly, but their disapproval or disguised criticism inevitably shows in their expressions. Many capitalists initially had some delusions about the situation of frantic war preparations, but since Mussolini announced that he would levy heavy taxes on them during the military parade in Bolsano, their excitement has been chilled to zero. The upper middle class also frowns and is even resentful, but there is nothing they can do. The only reason they have always helped Fascism is because it is the only savior to resist communism, but now the exorbitant taxes, heavy levies, and the depression of business and the gloom of the future have made them lose hope. However, they have to continue to help, because they know that if the current government collapses, it will immediately become a state of anarchy, or even become the world of the Communist Party. What they are most worried about is that if Italy's war with Abyssinia fails, Fascism will inevitably disintegrate; but the aftermath of the disintegration is unimaginable.</p>
<p>One Fascist said this: "Young people are wholeheartedly Fascists. They don't know anything else, but I am over fifty years old, I am both a Fascist and a complete nationalist; but we old people are not accustomed to the dangers caused by Fascism in its undertakings. I don't know what will happen to me and my family when I am old." From this, it can be seen that Mussolini's roar: "Venture!" is not even able to agitate his followers above a certain age. Those who once helped him seize power are mostly eager to live a "happy old age" and are unwilling to continue taking desperate risks. In the workers of northern and southern Italy, more than half have definitely not been subdued by Fascism. Even members of the Fascist labor union do not necessarily support the Fascist regime. They are only forced to join for economic reasons, so their attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian War is conceivable. But Mussolini may pay extra attention to them, because he used to be a socialist himself. He knows the importance of workers and cannot let them become desperate people. Although he thinks so, the workers definitely do not like Fascism. The workers who express support on the surface are only doing it for their own jobs. Especially those workers who participated in World War I or other wars are all the more in favor of peace. There are even those who openly oppose the war.</p>
<p>Not only are the workers in Italy like this, but even the General Staff of the Roman Army has opposed venturing into Abyssinia, which is now an open secret. The army, whose profession is being soldiers, also believes that this kind of venture is an extremely risky deal, considering the economic, financial and other practical aspects. It goes without saying that the troops who have already gone to Africa complain, and even the troops who have not yet left feel that the future is bleak. As for the news of wanting to avoid military service, we hear it even more often.</p>
<p>Even among Fascists in high positions, there are a few who opposed the venture from the beginning. However, although the General Staff also opposes it, they are all from the military and only know how to obey. They know that this venture is tantamount to gambling, but they have to support it. Regarding the attitude of the Italian Emperor, rumors also say that he opposes the war. However, Mussolini's methods are after all very strong. He does not want to bear the responsibility for the war alone. At the same time, he also makes the royal family share the responsibility for all war plans, because he tries his best to make many members of the royal family occupy the leading positions in the war. In this way, once there is an accident, he can very well push the blame on them.</p>
<p>I have already said above that there is no public opposition to the Italian-Abyssinian War among Italians. When they talk about this issue, they are very careful and cautious, fearing disaster. They are even unwilling to discuss this issue with a foreigner, fearing that he is a detective of the Fascists. A reporter from a certain newspaper heard three middle-aged businessmen in Milan talking about the war. They all opposed the war because prices had been raised too high and would continue to rise. Even daily commodities are difficult to sell, let alone the luxury goods that are still being manufactured in large quantities in northern Italy. Whether it is salaries or wages, they are constantly being drastically reduced. As the purchasing power of Italians decreases, and at the same time taxes increase, the general lack of prosperity in commerce is a natural result. Furthermore, Italians are now openly opposing price increases. A Fascist wanted to buy an orange on a hot day, and the seller asked for two lira. "This is a price for selling to the British, not for selling to Italians," he said angrily.</p>
<p>In many villages in Italy, the attitude of opposing the war, due to government suppression, can mostly only be written in chalk on the walls on both sides of the streets. In the narrow lanes of Venice and Genoa, in the small streets of Naples, the walls are full of slogans against the war. Slogans supporting the war by the Fascists are immediately painted over.</p>
<p>However, Fascism's thirteen years of terror policies have after all eradicated all public opposition. No matter what the Italians write on the walls, it is of no use in reality. This is why Mussolini is able to disregard everything and do whatever he wants. He has not only been doing whatever he wants for thirteen years, but he also wants to continue doing so, and at the same time he feels that he is able to do so, because he is still obviously a ruler of Italy. As for the future hidden dangers caused by the Italian-Abyssinian War, he has not paid much attention to them.</p>
<p>Now, any expression of opposition to the war in Italy is of course weak. Mussolini now of course has wholehearted young people behind him (because they have all been educated by the Fascists for thirteen years and do not know anything else), but the speculative deal of the Italian-Abyssinian War not only hides future hidden dangers in the country, but also creates a formidable enemy abroad.

<p>There are occasional instances of rising prices, but no disruptions or impacts on the market.</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping silver circles have largely determined a method for dealing with the centralized silver cash. First, they will statistically account for the amount of silver deposits and silver notes. Then, they will determine how to handle the silver cash, how to redeem silver cash with legal tender, and the methods for commercial bank notes. The issue of redeeming silver cash on the market is relatively simple, because in recent years, too much silver has flowed out of the Ping market, leaving very little. Apart from the silver firms, the amount of silver scattered among the citizens is minimal, so redemption will not be a problem. The steps determined by the association are that each bank will separately engage in internal statistics. At the same time, they will telegraph the Ministry of Finance and the three major banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, to request instructions on everything. After the above work is completed in a day or two, another general meeting will be held to decide on the methods for redeeming silver cash and commercial bank silver notes with legal tender, and then announced for implementation. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the price of copper coins in the Ping market soared a few days ago, the prices of general merchandise also surged. In the past two days, each bag of white flour has risen by six or seven dimes, and each dan of rice has also surged by one yuan and several dimes. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Silver Guild held a meeting on the 4th, and elected Bian Baimei, the head of the Bank of China, as chairman. Representatives from 23 banks and money houses attended. It was resolved that (1) the silver and money industries would uniformly comply with the government's methods for consolidating the currency system; (2) transfers among Tianjin counterparts would continue to be handled by the public treasury, and all payments would be made with the notes of the three banks. The silver cash stored in the public treasury would be sealed by the two guilds and the three banks according to the inventory on the 2nd; (3) from the 4th onward, all checks issued by the banks and money houses would be written in national currency. Previously issued checks and checks issued after the 4th that have the words "current silver dollar," "silver dollar," or "silver ocean" written on them would all be treated as national currency and paid in the notes of the three banks. The silver and money guilds have telegraphed silver and money counterparts in various places to inform customers and explain any doubts they may have. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Since the Ministry of Finance announced the currency decree, all industries in Zhenjiang have decided to comply. However, merchants are arbitrarily raising prices and lowering the price of foreign currency, so that the exchange rate of each yuan has fallen from 3,400 wen to 2,800 or 2,900 wen. It is now known that the business conditions of various industries will follow the Shanghai standard. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Because the Ministry of Finance is implementing the policy of consolidating the currency system, and the market is nervous, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary emergency meeting this morning and resolved: (1) to issue a public notice to advise merchants and citizens to earnestly abide by the laws and regulations and not to raise prices under any pretext; (2) to compile and print a notice to be distributed to citizens; (3) to schedule a joint meeting of various trade associations on the afternoon of November 6th; (4) regarding the issue of replenishing funds, to send a letter to the Silver Guild to earnestly discuss revitalizing the market; (5) to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to support the new policy of reforming the currency system, and to promptly implement the mortgage law for real estate, so as to implement it as soon as possible in order to further consolidate the effectiveness of the currency system, rescue the market, and revive the countryside. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have shipped one million yuan of legal tender banknotes from Shanghai to circulate in the market. The financial situation is quite stable, and the opening price of the gold market is 120 yuan. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wuhu) The financial circles of Wuhu held a meeting on the 5th regarding the currency law, and unanimously approved it. They also elected representatives to meet with the authorities to request that they maintain the market and stabilize prices. The money market has not been affected. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) The Provincial Government issued a proclamation on the 5th to strictly enforce the currency policy, strictly prohibiting rumors, and summoned the responsible persons of various banks and chambers of commerce in Anhui to give instructions on everything. The Anhui branch of the Central Bank of China has set up a legal tender exchange office and will establish an exchange office for mixed silver materials within this month. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Chengjun received a telegram from the Hankou Pacification Headquarters on the 5th, saying that the Hankou Municipal Government received an order from the Ministry of Finance on the night of the 3rd, and immediately convened the banking and business circles to discuss everything. A public notice was immediately distributed. The market was stable on the 4th. The prices of both imported and exported goods in foreign trade did not rise. The prices of daily necessities in the city, such as rice and charcoal, did not change, etc. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Rice Industry Association, since the change in currency policy, the price of rice in the capital has increased due to the sharp rise in the price of rice in Shanghai and Wuhu. In the past two days, the price has risen by four or five dimes per stone. In the past two days, the arrival of rice from Anhui and local gangs has been smooth. The price of cooked rice from Anhui is below 8.2 yuan per stone. The three types of cooked rice produced in Jiangning, Lishui, and Jurong, "Yang cooked," "top cooked," and "black cooked," are all 9 yuan per stone. The price of Su Geng rice from Wuxi is about 10.5 yuan per stone. The selling price of rice shops and stores must also add 6 dimes per stone for living expenses, i.e., Yang cooked rice sells for 9.6 yuan, and Anhui Xian cooked rice sells for 8.8 yuan. It is speculated that there is still a trend of continued price increases. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) After the central government's order to unify the issuance and centralize reserves arrived on the 5th, all banks and money houses uniformly complied, and the market was stable. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Because the silver and money industry received the order later, it implemented cash centralization starting on the 5th, and the market was stable. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After a meeting between the money industry exchange clearing house and various banks, it was announced that legal tender would be the standard, and banknotes and cash would be on par. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting today to discuss the promotion of legal tender and will advise various industries to suppress and stabilize prices. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) After the currency reform order was issued, the financial situation in this city was stable. The Bankers Association held a meeting and resolved to work together to implement it: 1. The industry will implement flat exchange rates and settle accounts in Shanghai. 2. No remittance fees will be charged for remittances to stores, only a small amount of postage and handling fees will be charged. 3. The allocation of funds in this city will be strictly restricted, and banks will no longer accept them. All inflows and outflows will be made in legal tender and banknotes approved by the government. Telegraphic transfers have risen from 15 yuan to 1 yuan. However, there is general concern that food prices will rise, and people are now competing to buy and store wheat, with over 1,400 tons traded. The silver and money industries will hold a meeting at the Bankers Association on the 6th. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Xi Yan, the manager of the Chongqing branch of the Central Bank of China, convened a meeting of the responsible persons of the city's silver and money industries at 2 p.m. on the 5th to explain in detail the emergency decrees announced by the Ministry of Finance on the 3rd. All banks and money houses were able to deeply understand the spirit of this currency reform and unanimously expressed their firm support. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) After the Ministry of Finance issued the new legal tender order, the three banks in Bing City, the Provincial Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the Railway Salt Bank, etc., before receiving a formal order from the Provincial Government, each bank continued to redeem cash as before. Although the number of redeemers was higher than in the past, the banks were able to cope with them due to sufficient reserves. In addition, the transactions of various firms in the market were still quite calm. The Provincial Bank and the Money Industry Association are now holding meetings to discuss countermeasures and have decided to temporarily maintain the status quo of the common use of banknotes and cash. The Bank of China, etc., has received an order from the head office. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) After the Ministry of Finance's unified currency law was issued here, the financial situation in the market turned stable. The authorities today summoned the banking community to show the main points of maintaining finance and telegraphed a report to the Beijing newspaper. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Xiamen branches of banks such as the Xiamen Central, South, Industrial, etc., received telegrams from the Shanghai head office yesterday to check the amount of banknotes issued so as to report them separately, and to continue to use them as usual. No new notes will be issued in the future. The banks have already issued banknotes, including two million from Xiamen Central, 1.3 million from South, 1.5 million from Industrial, and 1.4 million from Farmers. The Xiamen branch of the Provincial Bank will be established in December and will issue corner notes. The financial situation in this city is still stable yesterday and today. However, the price of small foreign currency has soared, with one foreign currency yuan only exchanging for 11.7 dimes. In addition, the Hong Kong government will also implement a currency system prohibiting the export of silver. The premium for Hong Kong currency, which was previously 480 yuan per 1,000 yuan, has fallen to 240 yuan yesterday. It is expected that it will be equal to the national currency in the future. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A certain banker said that after the central government announced that silver was nationalized, it was beneficial to Guangdong currency. Currently, the Guangdong province's national tax revenue is still calculated in small foreign currency. On the 5th, Hong Kong paper and silver dollars fell in price, and the paper currency of the three banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, rose slightly. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Silver Industry Association held a meeting on the evening of the 4th to discuss the central government's control of the currency system. Because Guangdong has always used the small foreign currency system, the market is not affected, and there is no need to discuss countermeasures for the time being. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shantou and Haikou in Guangdong have always used silver dollars as the standard and have decided to comply with the new currency law controlled by the Ministry of Finance. As for Guangzhou and other parts of Guangdong, which have always used small foreign currency as the standard, how to handle it will be decided after detailed consultation with the authorities.

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Shanghai published the confession of Li Zhenhua, the perpetrator of the assassination of Liu Zuozhou in Australia, which implicated the Beiping Military Branch. A reporter specifically inquired with a certain agency in Beijing, and the responsible person told him that the perpetrator had been interrogated by Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Luan-Yu District, and that the perpetrator's confession on August 28 of this year had been sent to Beijing. At that time, it was intended to be published, but since the accomplices mentioned in the confession had not yet been arrested, it was feared that it would hinder the investigation work. Moreover, the confession involved Japanese military agencies and Shi Yousan and others, which would only increase the disputes, so secrecy was maintained. Now that the Japanese newspapers have published it, we cannot remain silent and be wrongly accused. He then showed the reporter the perpetrator's confession, which was two to three thousand words long and gave a very detailed account of the crime. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Youth and the Nation (Part 1) <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Lectures given to middle school students nationwide on October 29th and 31st)</p>
<p>Qian Duansheng, Professor at National Central University</p>
<p>"Youth are the future masters of the nation." This saying is not only commonly used in China, a country that respects scholars, as a way to encourage young people who are engrossed in their studies, but also in other countries, youth are similarly praised. In the 19th century, Italy had a very famous patriot named Mazzini. He was the founder of the Young Italy movement, the greatest contributor to the unification of Italy, and also a model youth of both ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. He was one of Italy's three heroes, and also the most outstanding of the two heroes. I remember him saying something like this when he was arousing Italian youth scattered in various European countries.</p>
<p>If youth are the future masters of any country, then youth are especially the future masters of China. The general population of China has not received education, while youth are currently receiving modern education. At this critical juncture when the nation is facing dire difficulties, youth with higher intelligence naturally bear a greater responsibility for the country. In order to prepare for bearing the responsibilities they should bear in the future, youth should first understand the nation, and second, strive to be good citizens.</p>
<p>(1) To Understand Our Nation</p>
<p>Youth should naturally have a strong sense of patriotism for the nation. The reason why China's national strength is not as good as other major countries in the world certainly has various different reasons, but the weakness of the people's patriotism can be said to be the biggest and most fundamental reason. Why is the patriotism of our people so weak? Because the people's concept of the nation is too weak. The majority of the people have not received education, they do not know what the nation is, so they naturally have no feelings for the nation. Therefore, to love the country, one must first know everything about the country.</p>
<p>Political scientists believe that a nation is composed of three elements: people, land, and sovereignty. People and land are material elements, and sovereignty can be said to be a spiritual element.</p>
<p>People are the population. A country must have a population; without a population, there cannot be a country. This is self-evident.</p>
<p>But a country cannot be established with only a population and no land. At the same time, this so-called land must be fixed. Ancient nomadic peoples could not establish a country because they did not have fixed land. Without fixed land, there cannot be a government, and without a government, sovereignty cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>So what is sovereignty? Sovereignty, also known as the right to rule, is the right of the people to handle all public affairs within the national territory. To manage public affairs within the national territory, the people must establish a government. If the people's right to rule is complete, then this government is certainly supreme, and no other people except the citizens of the country can interfere. If the people's right to rule is not complete, for example, if country A (let's call it country A) cannot independently control its diplomatic power and must obtain the consent of country B, then the government of country A is not an independent government, the people of country A do not have complete management rights, which is not complete sovereignty, and country A does not become a nation.</p>
<p>The reason why a country cannot survive without sovereignty is very simple. A province has the people of the province, the land of the province, and the government of the province. A city also has the people of the city, the land of the city, and the government of the city. The difference between a nation and a province or city is that the power of the national government is supreme, while the provincial and municipal governments must be under the jurisdiction of the central government. In other words, a nation is independent, while provinces and cities are not independent; independent entities have sovereignty, while non-independent entities do not have sovereignty. If a group of people, with land and a government, or a place with people and a government, is considered to have established a nation, then wouldn't a province or a city also establish a nation? Wouldn't even a village be considered a nation? That is certainly incorrect. Therefore, political scientists insist on sovereignty as one of the three elements of a nation; merely having the two material elements of people and land cannot form a nation; it must also have sovereignty to become a nation.</p>
<p>Our China is an independent country, and of course, our China also has the three elements of people, land, and sovereignty. So what about our people, land, and sovereignty? These are the matters that youth should be most familiar with. To be familiar with these matters, one must know the strengths and weaknesses of these three aspects in order to truly love the country. Knowing only the strengths and not the weaknesses can easily lead to a kind of vanity, and knowing only the weaknesses and not the strengths can easily lead to discouragement, or even make one feel that our country is not lovable.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the people of China. The people of China have many advantages, but also many weaknesses. The first advantage is that our country is almost a nation-state. Nation is different from citizen. Citizens are the people of a country, while a nation is a combination of people, based on bloodline, language, religion, customs, habits, and history. The bloodline, language, etc., of the people of a country can be completely different, but the bloodline, language, etc., of members of the same nation must be largely the same. A nation-state is a country whose people belong to the same nation. The so-called nationalism in modern times is the movement of a nation seeking independence and becoming a country. A non-nation-state is a country whose people do not belong to the same nation. The Netherlands is a nation-state because its people all belong to the Dutch nation, and their bloodline, language, religion, customs, habits, and history are all the same. Belgium is not a nation-state because the people of Belgium belong to two nations: in the south are the Walloons, who are close to the French nation, and in the north are the Flemish, who are close to the Dutch nation. A nation-state is superior to a non-nation-state because the unity of a nation-state is stronger. Although it is said that the people of our China have five ethnic groups—Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan—the Chinese nation actually accounts for more than 98 percent of the 400 million people. The Manchus have long merged with the Han people into the Chinese nation. The Hui people and the Han people are very close in everything except religion. Only the Mongols, Tibetans, and some small ethnic groups in Xinjiang, as well as the uncivilized Miao people in the southwest, cannot be considered to be of the same nation as the Han people. However, these people have also had a common political history with the Han people for six or seven hundred years, so they are very close to the Han people. A country with so many people, and so many people almost united under the same nation, is something that no other country in the world can match, and it is also something that we can be most proud of. The Soviet Union is considered the largest country in the world, with a population second only to China and India, but only 120 million of the Soviet Union's 160 million people belong to the Great Russian nation, and the rest are different nations. The Soviet Union still cannot match China, and the other countries are even further behind.</p>
<p>Regarding the people, the second advantage of our country is that the Chinese nation is not only the largest but also a nation with the longest history and the oldest culture. From this long history, we can understand the spirit of struggle of our ancestors, and we can discover the great contributions of our nation to humanity. The Chinese nation has never been a nation that was born in comfort and grew up in comfort, nor has it been a nation without virtue or ability. In the process of our nation's development, we have experienced countless foreign invasions. From the Yi and Di of the Three Dynasties, through the Xiongnu of the Qin and Han dynasties, the Turks and Uyghurs of the Tang dynasty, the Liao and Jin dynasties of the Song dynasty, the Mongols, and up to the Manchus of the Ming dynasty, our Chinese nation was almost in danger of extinction at all times. However, because of the thick quality of the nation, these invading nations were either destroyed by us or assimilated by us, and in the end, it was still the victory of the Chinese nation. Since the eastward invasion of European powers in the last century, our country has again been in danger of being reduced to a colony at all times, and in recent years, the life of the country has been hanging by a thread. At this extremely urgent beginning, we should have a stronger national self-confidence. I believe that the more familiar we are with the past history of our nation, the more we will be able to increase our confidence in our nation.</p>
<p>But our people also have three major shortcomings. The first shortcoming is the underdevelopment of the people's knowledge. In civilized countries of the world, the people who are illiterate will never exceed 30 percent. However, at least 80 percent of our people are illiterate and have not received education. Because they are illiterate and have not received education, they cannot know themselves, nor can they know others. The wealth and power of others, the Chinese people do not know, the invasion of others, the Chinese people do not understand; at the same time, the glorious history of the Chinese nation, the Chinese people do not know to cherish. Therefore, although the Chinese people are of the same nation, the national consciousness and the concept of the nation are very weak, and this shortcoming has become a fatal wound for our country.</p>
<p>Second, our Chinese nation lacks a scientific mind. Because of the lack of a scientific mind, although our previous culture has its immortal aspects, it does not even have the ability to follow in the footsteps of modern industrial culture. Japan's ancient culture is very close to our ancient culture; but Japan's material civilization is no less than that of Western countries. Why? Because the Japanese have a scientific mind. Our scientific minds are inferior to others, so industrial culture has not yet developed, but in today's world, without industrial culture, one cannot establish a nation. Therefore, for the sake of our nation, anything that hinders the development of a scientific mind, such as the ancient imperial examination education, must be strictly prohibited, while education that is close to nature must be vigorously promoted.

<p>—Supporting the Policy of Currency System Reform—</p>
<p>According to reports from Hangzhou, the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to stabilize public sentiment in response to the government's implementation of the new currency policy, convened an emergency temporary meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and the Commercial Affairs Administration also participated. The meeting, chaired by Cheng Zhenji, resolved: (1) to issue a public notice to advise merchants and the public to earnestly abide by the laws and regulations and not to raise prices under any pretext; (2) to compile a notice and request the Public Security Bureau to distribute it to citizens; (3) to schedule a joint meeting of various trade associations at 3:00 p.m. on November 6; (4) to send a letter to the banking and money industries requesting them to earnestly discuss ways to raise funds and revitalize the market; (5) to telegraph the Ministry of Finance in support of the new policy of currency system reform, requesting the implementation of real estate mortgage measures to ensure early implementation, further consolidate the effectiveness of the currency system, relieve the market, and revive the countryside. At 11:00 a.m., the banking and money industries held a joint meeting at the Central Bank, attended by more than 60 people. The meeting resolved: (1) that the exact amount of cash reserves in each bank and money shop as of today should be reported to the Central Bank that evening and compiled into a report to the Shanghai Central Bank Headquarters; (2) that each bank and money shop should set up a cash exchange for exchanging legal tender as an agency for exchanging legal tender. The Zhejiang Provincial Government decided at its routine meeting today that counties in remote areas where it is impossible to exchange legal tender should be allowed to handle the matter at their discretion. As for the one-yuan legal tender bills of the three banks, because they are used to replace silver dollars, the demand for them has suddenly increased. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai requesting that they be shipped to Hangzhou in batches, totaling about one million yuan, which will be circulated in the market and will be sufficient to meet the demand. Furthermore, the financial and money markets on the 5th were still volatile compared to the 4th. Each legal tender yuan was worth 12 jiao and 10 wen in silver, and copper coins recovered to 3,450 wen. The gold market has opened, and both Ye Chi gold are priced at 120 yuan. (November 5th)</p>
<p>Suzhou - A Unique Case of Filicide</p>
<p>Wu Chucheng, a partner in the Ziyang Temple on Fourth Avenue in Shanghai, and his wife, Ms. Jiang, lived with their thirteen-year-old son, Wu Zaowang, at 14 1/2 Guimen Street, outside the Lumen Gate in Suzhou. They opened the Wu Yongcheng Oil and Wine Shop. However, Ms. Wu Jiang had an affair with a fellow villager, Wang Shiqing (Jixiang). Because her son discovered this and spread it around, it aroused her shame and anger. On the evening of the 4th, Wu Zaowang returned home from school and was strangled to death by his mother with a rope. She then pretended that he had committed suicide and reported it to the police station through a neighbor. Ms. Wu Jiang (also known as Guiyuan) was taken to the police station, and the District Procuratorate was notified. At 3:00 p.m. on the 5th, the District Procuratorate sent personnel to examine the body to verify the case. Also, Yang Shungen, a farmer from Chuanjinggang, Yanmu Pavilion, in the rural area of Suzhou, returned home from outside at noon the day before yesterday. For some unknown reason, he suddenly held a kitchen knife and hacked his three-year-old son to death. His eight-year-old son was also hacked on the head, but the injury was minor and he is currently being treated. The responsible police station has reported the case to the District Court and requested personnel to conduct an examination.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Organizing an Air Defense Committee</p>
<p>The county government believes that air defense is a necessary common sense for the people. Therefore, it has scheduled regular air defense exercises. Yesterday (the 5th) at 3:00 p.m., it convened representatives from the party, government, military, and various agencies, organizations, and schools to hold a preparatory meeting for air defense exercises. It was decided to organize an air defense committee, which would be divided into six groups: general affairs, publicity, intelligence, management, alarm, and suppression. The responsible personnel for each group were immediately appointed to begin work. It is expected that personnel will be dispatched within days to inspect and control lighting equipment.</p>
<p>Implementing National Labor Service</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Labor Service Regulations stipulate that the period from November 1 of this year to March 31 of next year is the water conservancy service season. During this period, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 50, regardless of whether they are civil servants or students, must perform labor service. The focus of this labor service is to dredge rivers and ponds. Each able-bodied man must serve for at least three days. After receiving the order, the Wuxi County Government immediately submitted it to the 63rd District Heads' Meeting and decided that each district should conduct a detailed investigation of the rivers and ponds to be dredged in accordance with the provincial regulations and report them by the 10th of this month. The Construction Bureau will then dispatch technical personnel to conduct surveys in each district. The minimum standard for each district is to dredge 50,000 cubic meters of rivers and ponds. It will supervise and urge each district to use the Baojia system to mobilize able-bodied men. This initiative will not only cultivate the people's labor habits but also provide considerable assistance to the future of national construction. As for the labor service methods for civil servants, students, and soldiers, the county government is currently drafting them in detail.</p>
<p>Market Chaos After Cash is Discontinued</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance stipulated on the 4th that banknotes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be legal tender and that cash could not be used, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Central China Bank, Continental Bank, Siming Bank, Industrial Bank, Xingye Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank in this city yesterday sealed up all the silver and silver dollars they had on hand and awaited instructions from the head office. The silver firms in this city also made long-distance calls to the silver firms in Shanghai yesterday to inquire. It was reported that the Shanghai gold and silver markets were still operating as usual, but the price of gold remained firm and tended to rise. As for future developments, it is necessary to wait for the Shanghai silver firms to hold a meeting to discuss the matter and ask the authorities for instructions before making a decision. In general, it has no fundamental impact on those who specialize in selling utensils. The price of gold in the market in this city has risen to 117 yuan per tael. The rice market has also seen a sharp rise of seven or eight jiao. Yesterday, the market suddenly fell by three or four jiao. New white japonica rice was 10.2 jiao per dan, down to 9.78 jiao. Japonica rice was 5.05 yuan. There are three reasons for the sudden rise and fall: (1) various banks purchased goods and stockpiled them; (2) some silk cocoon merchants purchased a large amount of rice with the profits from silk cocoons and stockpiled it to wait for a good price to sell; (3) the rice industry believes that the Ministry of Finance has issued emergency regulations to reform the currency system, and various banks can lend as much as possible, paying the funds to merchants without relying on the income of buyers, and using the loans from the banks to purchase rice and other grains. However, various banks still restrict lending, so the rice market suddenly fell. Pawnshops have been very busy recently. According to people in the pawn industry yesterday, the price of gold has soared recently, and many customers have come to redeem gold items. It is estimated that after redeeming them, they are exchanging them for cash at various silver firms. In addition, the prices of goods in various industries have been relatively stable due to the sharp drop in the price of foreign currency. However, yesterday the price of foreign currency fell from 2,990 wen to 2,690 wen, causing market chaos and public panic.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Auxiliary Coin Balance Meeting</p>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce Auxiliary Coin Balance Market Price Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, chaired by Yu Yicheng, to discuss the following matters: (1) The market price of jiaozi and copper coins in neighboring counties such as Shenxi has already risen sharply. Should the market price in this county also rise accordingly to achieve balance? The public decided that the market price would be as follows: copper coins 3,050 wen, jiaozi 12 jiao and 5 fen, jiaozi blanks 2,440 wen, and small foreign currency 82% of the Shanghai large foreign currency. (2) The market price of jiaozi and copper coins in neighboring counties is bound to fluctuate in the future. Should this committee hold meetings every day? It was decided that the committee would hold meetings for one week from today to the 11th to stabilize the market.

<p>A Large Number of Fishing Boats are Stolen and Kidnapped</p>
<p>Although the fishing season in Dinghai Shenjiamen this year is better than in previous years, many fishermen are unable to go fishing because they are trapped by the cost of fishing. Therefore, less than one-third of the large fishing fleets went to sea this year compared to last year. In addition, the low prices hurt the fishing industry, causing the fishing village economy to plummet. Recently, the fishing area has been near Langgang Ocean. On the evening of the 31st, a large number of pirates suddenly appeared in the Guanshan Ocean area and seized more than 20 fishing boats belonging to Zhang Da Niang, Jiang A Xiao, Xia Dingxing, Xin Yunqing, and others. The pirate leaders, Jin Shunan and Huang Chunshan, sent letters to the families of the seized fishermen, instructing them to prepare funds and go to a designated location to redeem their relatives. The other fishing boats that were not kidnapped returned to Shenjiamen to report the incident. At that time, the fishing industry association and other fishing industry organizations had no warships to dispatch and could not pursue the pirates. The next afternoon, various fishing industry organizations held a meeting at the Fish Warehouse Guild to discuss the matter. It was learned that no ships had been seen patrolling the ocean recently, which is a major threat to the safety of fishermen. It was decided to send telegrams to the Security Office, the Fishing Industry Police Bureau, the Water Police Bureau, and other agencies, requesting them to quickly send warships to patrol and protect the ocean. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the county government requesting them to appeal on behalf of the fishermen to ensure the safety of the fishing industry.</p>
<h3 id="e59">A Double Life <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Western culture has invaded China with an irresistible force. At the same time, Chinese culture has stubbornly preserved its traditions. As a result, in the thoughts and lives of Chinese people, a state of coexistence of new and old cultures appears everywhere. This is called a double life. For example, here a small family is being organized, and there, the practice of nine generations living together is being encouraged. Here, divorce advertisements are being published, and there, chastity arches are being built. Even these two states appear in the same family or in the same person, creating all kinds of worries and pains.</p>
<p>Everyone only knows to blame the instability of people's livelihoods over the years on major causes such as natural disasters, man-made calamities, internal strife, and foreign aggression. Little do they know that, apart from these, there is another cause that most directly makes people's livelihoods unstable, which is this double life. It can make the general public look left and right, look around, and be at a loss as to what to do, constantly wandering on the wrong path in life. It can enable all kinds of words and deeds to find a basis for establishment, and all kinds of evils to find a reason for defense, so that right and wrong are reversed, and black and white are confused. How many tens of millions of people in recent China have been full of hesitation and painstaking efforts for the sake of the direction of life, and finally fell into blind obedience and suffered failure! To say nothing else, just looking at the smallest thing in the double life—the coexistence of the lunar and solar calendars—is enough to cause people a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>"Sincerity within will surely manifest itself externally," is it only true of individuals? Society is also like this. In our country's folk society, which is living a double life, incompatible states of temporal errors are revealed everywhere, forming a wonderful world of cartoons. Cartoons have become quite popular in our country recently, and the double life is the main reason for this. Try taking a leisurely walk in the city streets and observing the current situation quietly, and you will surely discover various incompatible states of double life, which are laughable or alarming. A streamlined car is sometimes seen next to a sedan chair being carried. In front of a tram, there are sometimes two "Silence" signs being carried on shoulders. A pair of wooden clogs is walking on a cement sidewalk. Six red gauze lanterns are hanging near neon lights. A stone arch bridge is lined up next to a railway. An ancient temple is sandwiched between two high-rise buildings. ... Walking into a house; sometimes you will see "Heaven Bestows Blessings" hanging in the drawing room of a Western-style house, with incense burners, candle holders, and two strings of paper gold ingots placed for worship. On the door opposite the flush toilet, there is a yellow paper strip that says, "Jiang Taigong is here, nothing is taboo." If it is winter, you will see people wearing top hats sitting on Ning-style beds; people with bronze braziers in their hands holding water pipes. If it is a festive day, you will see ancient brides and modern grooms, and people wearing costumes performing kneeling ceremonies. If it is for a patient, you can even see Western doctors and Taoist priests walking into the same family. ...</p>
<p>But this is not a state unique to China. Japan is also like this. Formally, and also in terms of art, Japan can be said to be the country with the most flourishing Eastern style. Various styles of ancient Eastern life, such as sitting on the floor, walking in wooden clogs, and men's and women's clothing, etiquette, etc., have long been abandoned in China, but are still practiced in Japan today. When the Meiji Restoration occurred and Western culture was introduced to Japan, the state of double life in their society was probably even more laughable and alarming than what we have now. Ukiyo-e master Yoshitoshi's works include paintings satirizing the incompatible state at that time. He depicted members of the Diet in the early Meiji era wearing "haori" (Japanese outer jacket), with a "hakama" (waist apron), while wearing Western top hats and leather shoes, creating a comical appearance. Modern Japanese art theorists also curse the double life in Tokyo. For example: wearing wooden clogs and riding a tram, an old-fashioned bride and a groom in a tuxedo, a Western-style building and a Japanese-style old house, torii (wooden archways) lined up, and people in Western clothes kneeling down to perform Japanese etiquette when they meet… They say that the coexistence of these Western and Eastern styles makes the street scene incompatible and the environment ugly, which is "non-artistic." They are striving to demand improvement, harmony, and the artisticization of the city streets. Artists, art lovers, and those who care about "city appearance" living in the current Chinese society probably all have the same feeling about their curses and demands?</p>
<p>This kind of cursing and demanding has its own legitimate reasons, but that incompatible appearance is also an inevitable product. Western culture has rushed into the East with an irresistible force, and it is impossible not to accept it.</p>
<p>However, who can sweep away all Eastern old habits and make it completely Westernized immediately? Judging from the hearts of artists, it seems that they hope to be completely Westernized immediately, so that people standing on the streets of Tokyo or Shanghai feel as if they are standing on the streets of Paris or London. Otherwise, they would simply want to be completely Eastern-style, so that people living in modern society feel as if they are living in ancient society. However, both are impossible. It is certainly impossible to return to ancient times; how easy is it to completely Westernize? Even if it is "easy," (Note: I remember a certain ancient person said that the word "easy" is not connected, but rather the two words "how" and "allow" are connected, now I force it.) our noses are not naturally high, our eyes are not naturally blue, and our skin is not naturally white, so this Westernization is also incomplete, then what attitude should we take towards this matter when we are born in modern China? Are we going to always live this laughable and incompatible double life?</p>
<p>No, our future has its own new road waiting to be opened up. This is the road of "chemical combination" of Eastern and Western cultures, and it can also be said to be the road of "great harmony" of world cultures. Material civilization originated in the West, but it is not exclusive to the West, and should be a gift of "the times" that all ethnic groups in the present world must accept. Most of the various material civilization constructions we have in our country today are transported hard from the West and inserted raw and ruthlessly into our country. All the laughable and incompatible double lives are produced from this. In other words, in our current life, Eastern and Western cultures are "mixed" together, so there is a double life. We must teach them to "combine chemically" to produce a third kind of new life, and then can we get rid of the various ugliness and pains mentioned above. Furthermore, the West will not always be an advanced nation. In the future world, there will definitely be mutual influence and mutual assimilation, and gradually move towards the road of "great harmony."</p>
<p>We should not hesitate to abandon various old habits, and we should not be afraid to accept various new trends. As long as we take "reasonableness" as the basis and strive to create a new life, we will be in line with the purpose of world harmony. It is said that the Japanese once had a proposal to abolish their original script and use Roman characters arranged horizontally. There is also an attempt to abolish the separation of "Japanese painting department" and "Western painting department" in art schools and only set up a "painting department." However, it has not yet succeeded. I remember that a few people in China also tried to use horizontally written, phonetic alphabet-spelled national sounds, but no one paid attention. This is certainly not easy to do. But I am foolishly dreaming here: setting up armaments and engaging in wars is nothing more than seeking the happiness of human life. If all countries in the world could save all the expenses used for armaments and wars and transfer them to the construction costs of the future "world of great harmony", it would certainly not be difficult to achieve, and the lives of all mankind would certainly be much happier! The world's artists will surely rejoice even more! Unfortunately, this is just my dream.</p>

<h3 id="e60">City Chamber of Commerce and Various Trade Associations Jointly Telegraph Support for Legal Tender <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Three Bank Notes Need to Increase Sharply Market Stabilizes Rice Prices City Government Strictly Prohibits Raising Prices</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance issued a public notice stating that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, and cash transactions were prohibited, the Issuing Reserve Committee held a meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to draft operating rules, stipulating the standard exchange rate of the three banks for foreign currency, unlimited buying and selling of foreign currency, and the city government issued a public notice strictly prohibiting raising prices. The City Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, and Yu Qiaqing, among others, sent telegrams of support. The Ministry of Finance completed its investigation of the cash reserves of various banks and money houses and ordered the exchange of legal tender for the three banks' banknotes according to the amounts. The need for the three banks' banknotes has increased sharply. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Prepares Rules</p>
<p>The Issuing Reserve Management Committee was established on the 4th, with Song Ziwen, Hu Bijiang, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, and Li Jue elected as standing committee members, and Xu Kan and six others appointed to draft management and operating rules. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Xu Kan convened the drafting committee members at the Central Bank's third-floor board meeting room for the drafting committee meeting. Xu Kan, Song Hanzhang, Zhang Gongquan, Tang Shoumin, Xu Xinliu, Li Fuzun, and Li Jue attended. Xu Kan chaired the meeting. The committee members expressed their opinions on the methods for exchanging silver dollars and silver for legal tender, as well as operating rules. The chairman summarized the opinions and drafted an outline, which will be submitted to the Issuing Reserve Management Committee for discussion and approval at the second meeting, before being submitted to the Imperial Ministry for approval and implementation. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Ministry Completes Inspection of Bank and Money House Reserves</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance issued a public notice stating that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, it dispatched personnel yesterday morning to various banks in the city, including Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Kenye, Tongshang, China Industrial, Jincheng, Yanye, Dalu, Zhongnan, Siming, Shanghai, Guohua, Xinhua, Jiangsu, as well as the joint reserve of money houses, to investigate the total amount of cash reserves. This has been completed. The cash reserves, except for those sent to the Bank Preparation Management Committee to be used as reserves, may be exchanged for legal tender from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications according to the amounts.</p>
<p>Demand for Three Banks' Legal Tender Increases Sharply</p>
<p>After the new currency policy was implemented on the 4th, merchants and citizens complied with government decrees, using the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as legal tender for all receipts and payments. Therefore, the demand for the three banks' banknotes increased sharply, especially for one-yuan notes. According to information from the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, on the 4th, the amount of one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes issued in this city alone reached approximately five million yuan. The issuance amounts of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were both around one million yuan. As for the interior, although the Ministry has temporarily allowed the use of silver, the demand for banknotes has also increased. Branches of the three banks in various locations have sent telegrams requesting remittance, which have been met with the release of banknotes. As for the banknotes issued by Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Siming, Tongshang, Kenye, China Agricultural and Industrial, Agricultural and Commercial, Farmers, and Zhejiang Local banks, they are all allowed to be used as usual.</p>
<p>Central Bank Sends Letters to Foreign Banks</p>
<p>In addition to sending the original text of the Ministry of Finance's public notice stating that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender to various foreign banks, the Central Bank also sent letters requesting them to exchange silver for legal tender, stating: "The Ministry of Finance has announced a new currency system, setting several measures, including the provision that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender. At the same time, those who own silver must exchange it for legal tender. When exchanging silver, you may give legal tender to your bank, or if your bank wishes, it can be treated as a deposit. This bank is acting on this instruction and hereby notifies your bank."</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Consider Measures Appropriate</p>
<p>Reporters from the New News Agency visited foreign banks such as Chartered Bank and HSBC yesterday morning. They all considered the Ministry of Finance's public notice stating that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender to be an appropriate measure and the only good way to stabilize China's finances. They have all approved the Central Bank's request to exchange silver for legal tender, as this measure is very beneficial to foreign banks in China.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Houses Discuss Remittance Methods</p>
<p>The Bankers Association has decided on the second of three business methods: If there is excess remittance but a shortage of remittance heads among colleagues, silver dollars may be temporarily remitted to settle the difference with the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. The detailed methods will be discussed jointly by the Bankers Association, the Joint Reserve of Money Houses, and the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. According to reporters from the New News Agency, Zhu Puquan, manager of the Bankers Association's joint reserve, Qin Runqing, manager of the Money Houses' joint reserve, and representatives from the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications have already begun informally exchanging views yesterday. Once a general outline is agreed upon, a meeting will be formally convened in the coming days to decide on the methods as soon as possible to facilitate settlement between banks and money houses.</p>
<p>City Government Strictly Prohibits Raising Prices</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau yesterday, saying: "The currency policy promulgated by the Ministry of Finance this time is a major plan for the revival of the economy and the stabilization of finance, and is of utmost importance. It has been repeatedly and explicitly prohibited to attempt to speculate and raise prices. However, it has been found that commodity prices in this city have risen sharply in the past two days. For example, the price of rice has risen by as much as one or two yuan. It is obvious that unscrupulous merchants are manipulating and hoarding. If they are not severely punished, it will be insufficient to educate and deter the perpetrators and maintain local stability. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly and conscientiously crack down, and to arrest and prosecute unscrupulous merchants who violate the order according to the law, you are to strictly comply with this order and report the compliance situation as soon as possible. This is the order." November 5, 1935, Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Issues Notice Urging Restraint</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: The Ministry of Finance issued an order on the 4th of this month to make the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications the national legal tender. The banknotes of other Chinese banks that have been approved to issue are allowed to be used as usual. This is originally intended to centralize reserves and prevent the outflow of silver. The financial authorities have made sincere announcements to stabilize currency and finance. At the same time, a special committee has been set up to manage the issuance reserves, striving to consolidate the credibility of legal tender. All members of the business community should recognize that this move is purely to stabilize the currency system, and refrain from unnecessary disturbances. All prices for the sale of grain and food, and exchange rates for silver dollars and copper coins, should be in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's announcement on the 4th of this month, and should not be increased by more than a fraction. The price set by the Minister for money houses and the market is 12 cents of subsidiary currency or 3,000 copper coins in exchange for one yuan of legal tender, and should not be arbitrarily lowered, so as not to hinder people's livelihoods. This is of utmost importance. To the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry, Rice Shops, and Tobacco Exchange.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: In order to stabilize currency and finance, your ministry issued a public notice on the 4th of this month making the banknotes of the three banks legal tender, and allowing the banknotes of Chinese banks that have been approved to issue to be used as usual, reviving the economy, and striving for self-reliance. The association will lead the business community to sincerely support this. However, this matter is closely related to stabilizing prices and controlling foreign exchange, and must be carried out in conjunction in order to make comprehensive plans. We request your ministry to fully plan and maintain these two aspects, and not allow those who are suspicious and speculative to obstruct and destroy, so as to live up to the original intention of reforming the currency system. We sincerely submit this request, respectfully requesting adoption. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Trade Associations Jointly Telegraph Support</p>
<p>163 trade associations in this city, including the silk and satin industry and the paper industry, telegraphed Minister Kong, saying: "To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance: Our country has been deeply affected by the drastic changes in silver prices. Financial crises have arisen repeatedly. Industry and commerce have declined day by day. The dangerous situation is ever-present, making it impossible to live in peace. The people have long been unable to make a living. This time, Your Excellency has taken decisive action to announce changes to the currency system, which is the only remedy to revitalize the national economy and stabilize the financial foundation. The benefits lie not only in unified issuance and centralized reserves, but also in the revival of rural areas and the development of industry and commerce. As for managing exchange rates and controlling trade, which have been limited by facts in the past and could not be decisively implemented, they can now be easily resolved. Compared to Sang Hongyang and Kong Jin, you are no less worthy. However, since the currency system is reformed, our country's economic structure will inevitably change accordingly. Prices will be stimulated first. How to equalize prices and adjust supply and demand in the future so that the national economy gradually prospers will involve a myriad of things, all related to major plans. It is believed that if we can take the opportunity to control industry and commerce and manage foreign trade to promote reasonable production and balance international receipts and payments, then the revival and salvation will lie in this move. All of the above has been previously submitted to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce for submission to the Yuan and the Ministry, please adopt them. Your Excellency's plans for the country are impartial and loyal, and I think you have long been aware of them. Extraordinary achievements can only be accomplished by extraordinary people. I hope that you will contribute your plans and see them implemented. Our associations will certainly support your instructions with all our hearts. This telegram is submitted, respectfully requesting your review. Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry, Paper Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and 163 other trade associations."</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Sends Telegram Offering Opinions</p>
<p>Nanjing, sent separately to Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, President Ju of the Judicial Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, and President Yu of the Control Yuan: In recent years, the world economic panic has reached its peak. Industry and commerce have declined, and all industries have languished, especially in our country. Imports have increased year by year, and the outflow of silver has increased even more. The market for industry and commerce has declined daily. If the government authorities do not act decisively and take effective measures, the economy will inevitably collapse one day. Feeling the pain deeply, and with the national duty of a citizen, I have contributed my views to the government for the past six years, but they have not been adopted. Moreover, those engaged in finance, for the sake of maintaining their own interests, have obstructed in various ways, so that the situation has dragged on until now, with even fewer cash reserves and even tighter currency contraction. Now that the Ministry of Finance has announced the implementation of the legal tender system, although the implementation is somewhat late, it is still fortunate for the country to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Upon hearing the news, I am deeply pleased. However, in order to seek economic recovery, we must rely on this system. As for the fundamental solution, we must at least maintain an average balance of imports and exports. To seek an average balance, maintaining and promoting industry is of the utmost importance. To revive industry, we must reduce interest rates. The excessive interest rates in our country are a fatal injury to industry. If industry can be revived, industry and commerce will naturally prosper. The Ministry of Finance's announcement has already mentioned the precedents of various countries, and sufficient funds, supply to industrial and commercial enterprises, and policies to rescue real estate have been pre-determined and will be implemented in sequence. I deeply hope that the authorities will uphold this principle and implement it resolutely, striving to realize it in the shortest possible time. We should pay more attention to construction, and construction should be based on production, and we should absolutely prevent competing with the people for profits and other malpractices. The future of revival will be somewhat promising. All of you are planning for the country, and I dare to respectfully submit my humble opinions for your adoption. Yu Hede.</p>
<p>Balance Tax Rate Slightly Higher Than Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications committee members of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Board, Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen, decided at the Business Bureau of the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday that the balance tax rate would be 58.5%, which is 1.25% higher than the previous month's 6.75%. The increase in the balance tax is to prevent the export of silver.</p>
<p>Central Bank Distributes Branch Markets</p>
<p>The Central Bank announced the selling prices for telegraphic transfers on the morning of the 5th as follows: (1) London one shilling two pence halfpenny (per national currency one yuan), (2) New York 29.75 US dollars, (3) Paris 450 francs, (4) Berlin 73.50 marks, (5) Japan 1003 yen, (6) Hong Kong 78 Hong Kong dollars (all above per national currency 100 yuan). The balance tax for silver export is 58.5%. The HSBC's quoted prices on the morning of the 5th were also similar to those of the Central Bank, so foreign exchange has been very stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Prices of Subsidiary Currency in the Money Market</p>
<p>After the Money Houses Association received the order to announce the prices of subsidiary currency, the opening prices in the silver market yesterday were: Jiangnan and Guangdong subsidiary currency corner market, both at 833 yuan and 3 jiao for 10,000 corners; copper coins at 3,000 cash for 100 yuan. As for the exchange prices in various tobacco exchange stores, they ranged from 10 jiao 400 cash to 10 jiao 450 cash per yuan, with copper coins between 2,800 cash and 2,900 cash, and double coins between 460 cash and 490 cash, all below the prescribed prices.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Silver Reserves Exceed 300 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Reporters from the New Sound News Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday morning that the total amount of silver reserves in Shanghai last week was 44,170,000 taels, 323,090,000 yuan, and 7,980 bars. The silver reserves in Chinese banks were 2,150,000 taels, 244,930,000 yuan, and 7,980 bars. According to the Bank of China's report at the end of September, the total amount of silver reserves in Shanghai converted into silver dollars was 336,013,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Five Exchanges</p>
<p>The joint meeting of the city's five exchanges, including the gold industry, securities, yarn and cloth, flour, and miscellaneous grains, was held at 4:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the yarn and cloth exchange on Aidoa Road. The meeting reported on the Ministry of Finance's announcement of six measures and discussed the issue of settling accounts with legal tender for future transactions in each exchange. Mu Ouchu, chairman of the yarn and cloth exchange, Du Yuesheng, chairman of the gold industry (represented by Xu Busun), Gu Xinyi, chairman of the miscellaneous grains exchange, Wang Yiting, chairman of the flour exchange, and Zhang Weiru, chairman of the securities exchange, attended. After Mu Ouchu reported on the process, the meeting discussed the six measures announced by the Ministry of Finance. (Resolution) To comply with and implement them. (2) The issue of settling accounts for future transactions in each exchange. (Resolution) To use the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance for settlement. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Rice Market Recovers, Prices Fall Back</p>
<p>The rice price in this city soared the day before yesterday, and the market suddenly changed. At that time, the market price was chaotic and uneven, and the highest price broke through the peak of 13 yuan and 67 jiao. Therefore, people were panicked. After the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to earnestly persuade rice merchants from various provinces, the market situation eased slightly in the afternoon. Since yesterday, it has returned to normal. The highest rice price has fallen back by about 4 jiao, and the medium and secondary rice prices have fallen back by 7 or 8 jiao. Currently, the top-grade rice is around 13 yuan, the medium-grade rice is 12, 3, or 4 jiao, the secondary-grade rice is 11 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao, the foreign rice (Saigon) is 11 yuan and 5 jiao, and the small squeezed rice is 10 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Coal Industry Association Prohibits Raising Prices</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued a ban on the use of silver, some coal merchants in this city have taken the opportunity to raise the price of coal by as much as 2 or 3 yuan per ton in two days, which is obviously a monopoly. Therefore, the Coal Industry Association held an emergency executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss measures to stop this. Committee members Bao Zhezhi, Pan Yisan, Mao Chunpu, Xu Yiyong, and Han Chengpu attended. Chairman Chen Yushu reported that after the government reformed the currency system, some coal merchants raised coal prices and monopolized the market, which should be stopped. It was decided that the association would assess coal prices for sale, and those who deliberately violate this would be reported to higher authorities for severe punishment. The meeting then adjourned. The association's emergency notice is recorded below: "Emergency Notice: It has been found that coal prices have been arbitrarily raised recently. Members have reported this to the association. After convening an emergency executive committee meeting to discuss preventive measures, it was decided to notify members that at the beginning of the suspension of cash exchange, the prices of various types of coal must not be raised without reason. If there are any deliberate violations, please report to the association at any time for correction. If there are any monopolistic behaviors, the association will report the facts to higher authorities for sanctions. As for the national coal mines, they should supply as much national coal as possible and not monopolize the market and raise prices. In order to stabilize public sentiment and market prices, promote price uniformity, and promote national coal, the association hereby issues this notice for all members to comply with."</p>
<p>Silver Shops Have Two Questions About Business</p>
<p>According to reporters from the National News Agency, Fu Shengmao, standing committee member of the Silver Shops Association, said that the industry originally intended to send a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to request instructions regarding the Ministry of Finance's ban on the use of silver this time. However, since this matter concerns the survival of the silver shop industry nationwide, not just a local issue in Shanghai, it is planned to solicit the opinions of silver shop colleagues across the country and then discuss the measures. Shanghai is the center, and silver shops throughout Jiangsu Province have already agreed. According to Fu, the industry has two questions regarding the Ministry of Finance's order this time: (1) If someone comes to exchange old jewelry in the future, should it be accepted? Accepting it would violate the Ministry of Finance's order, and refusing it would cause a shortage of raw materials. (2) Currently, each silver shop still has a small amount of silver that can be used for utensils, but after it is used up, there will be a shortage of raw materials. Can the Central Bank supply it continuously? Otherwise, the silver shop industry nationwide will not be able to survive. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to the above two points.</p>

<p>Li Pingheng Enters Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>Before Reporting to the Central Government</p>

<h3 id="e63">Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses the Matter of Telephone Rate Hikes <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Committee Members Consider Each Clause in Detail; Experts from Four Countries Attend and Respond</p>
<p>Following the submission of the report on telephone issues by the Special Telephone Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Board of Directors, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council convened a meeting on Monday (October 28th) to discuss telephone matters. Various experts attended to provide consultations. The experts present included Mr. Hu Ruixiang (Chinese), Mr. Inada (Japanese), Mr. Brown (British), and Mr. Ray (American). Members of the Public Works Committee first inquired of the experts whether the prevailing state of general socio-economic decline had been taken into consideration when formulating the various recommendations. Expert Mr. Brown responded that while this point was not discussed at the beginning of the report, the final recommendations were not entirely unrelated to the current economic situation. A member of the Public Works Committee stated that the report did not elaborate on how prices should be increased if the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to retain the per-instrument billing method, and therefore, the report was not yet complete. Mr. Brown replied that this question was very simple. From April 1st to the end of July, the net profit of the Shanghai Telephone Company had almost reached 10 percent. However, if the per-instrument charge was increased by another 11 percent to offset the losses from the reduction in the number of telephones, the company could obtain a net profit of 10 percent. Mr. Ray added that if the existing per-instrument charge were increased again to achieve the desired net profit, the number of telephones would inevitably decrease further. If so, the telephone rates would inevitably increase again. Therefore, even under the per-instrument system, there was no reliable method for ensuring the company's revenue. Subsequently, upon the recommendation of various committee members and with the agreement of the experts, an appendix was added to the report, outlining the pricing that should be adopted if the per-instrument system were to be retained.</p>
<p>The discussion then moved on to the "Equipment" section of the report. Mr. Brown stated that he had personally visited fifty or sixty telephone users, and Mr. Ray also stated that he had spoken with twenty or thirty users. They all stated that the current service was far superior to what they had previously had. Mr. Brown stated that he had not been able to speak with a large number of Japanese users, but based on the results of his conversations with a small number of Japanese people, he could conclude that public opinion must be highly satisfied. Mr. Inada stated that he had met with a large number of Japanese people, and they all said that the telephone service was excellent, but some of them had raised various difficulties in communicating with the Chinese areas.</p>
<p>When discussing the expenditure section, the item "intangible capital of over 30,000 yuan" was mentioned. It was said that this item came from the old company's old accounts, representing the price paid for assets and the difference between the subsequent price adjustment. Moreover, since the conversion to automatic switchboards, capital expenditures for business expansion had already increased. Mr. Brown stated that the total amount of the company's expenditure was approximately 40 million yuan, which was the estimated value of all the company's assets in 1934, including those acquired from the old company and those added independently, up to that time. As stated in the report, the various properties were listed and then constituted the total amount of the company's investment. After the replacement of automatic switchboards, the clearing procedures were cumbersome and had to be somewhat delayed, so a comprehensive estimate was only available by July 1934. Mr. Ray added that this 40 million yuan was, first, the result of the estimated value of the old company's equipment in 1934. This estimate was made on August 5, 1930. The remainder was the cost of new equipment and properties built since 1930. In other words, the old properties in use, combined with the new properties built since 1930, equaled 40 million yuan.</p>
<p>A committee member immediately inquired about how depreciation was handled between 1930 and 1934. Mr. Brown said that, according to the practices of all other telephone companies, in order to maintain the integrity of capital, a depreciation rate must be found on all property. The method of seeking this rate must be carried out step by step in each department. That is, the length of life of each part of the equipment must first be determined, and then multiplied by the amount of investment in each part. This percentage, if applied to all of the telephone company's equipment, would reach 4.5 percent per year. Regardless of the company, this depreciation percentage should be set aside as amortization of the company's assets. Mr. Brown continued that this method of depreciation calculation is beneficial to both the company and its users, because the company's net profit is enjoyed not on 40 million, but on 34 million yuan of invested capital.</p>
<p>Continuing to discuss the equipment installation at each station, a committee member inquired whether the rapid completion of the automatic switchboard replacement work had any effect on the final cost. Mr. Brown said that this question was quite difficult to answer, because it contained components of comparison that should be weighed. On the one hand, in order to ensure that the work was scientific, fifty engineers were brought in from all over the world to specialize in the matter, and the cost would inevitably increase. But at the same time, because of the use of these top-notch professionals, the work was completed on time, and the period during which all personnel should be paid was shortened. Roughly speaking, seeking rapid and complete work would inevitably lead to a slight increase in costs, but it was impossible to make a definitive conclusion. A committee member further inquired whether it was an unreasonable requirement for the automatic switchboard conversion work to be completed within two years. Mr. Brown said that there was nothing unreasonable about it.</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange rate, a committee member inquired how the company prevented losses from exchange rate fluctuations. The head of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department replied that the company had settled its foreign exchange at appropriate exchange rates and times, so from a global perspective, telephone users need not worry too much about this.</p>
<p>The committee members then discussed the company's operating and maintenance expenses. According to the experts' opinions, these equipment expenses could not be reduced unless they could be obtained from China or locations closer than the existing ones. As for the report's statement that the total cost of each telephone in Shanghai was 46.2 yuan, with what was it being compared? Mr. Brown said that comparable costs included China's 35 yuan per telephone and Japan's 37 yuan. However, in Shanghai, there were other reasons for the increased expenditure, most of which were listed in the report. At this point, a committee member pointed out that the number of foreign employees enjoying high salaries in the company was an important reason. However, without these high-salaried foreign employees, foreign investment would not be so enthusiastic. Mr. Ray stated that only companies under the same jurisdiction with equivalent standards could be appropriately compared. Therefore, in the United States, a price adopted in one place was often rejected by the courts in another. Mr. Brown also said that telephone construction in the United Kingdom and the United States had its own differences, so it was unfair to compare them rashly. However, in terms of the situation in Shanghai, the cost of supply was not too high.</p>
<p>Regarding the per-call charging system, Mr. Brown said that he had received hundreds of letters on the subject. In his view, most of them originated from people who abused the telephone. He had personally investigated and discovered many abuses. This abuse was the reason why the per-instrument charging system had been abandoned everywhere in the world. More than a decade ago, the British House of Commons also discussed this matter. According to the report of the House of Commons committee, only a small number of users who "made the most of" the telephone at the time advocated for retaining the per-instrument charging system. The so-called "use" was actually "abuse." Therefore, the special committee deeply wished to prevent users from paying only the monthly rent for the per-instrument charge while making more than 2,000 calls per month. However, as stated in the report, more than half of residential users would pay lower telephone bills in the future. Mr. Ray also stated that under the current per-instrument charging system, the company's revenue came entirely from small users, while the company lost money on large users. Therefore, part of what small users paid was the price for the enjoyment of the use of the telephone by other users. Furthermore, if the per-instrument charge were increased again, the number of telephones would inevitably decrease, and the effectiveness of the supply would not diminish as a result. This was detrimental to all aspects of Shanghai's economic society. If a per-call charging price was adopted, small users would benefit first, and the number of people subscribing to the telephone would also increase, gradually making the function more widespread. This was the simplest philosophy of the per-call charging system.</p>
<p>A committee member then stated that although it was said that general small users could save on telephone bills in the future, most still favored the per-instrument charging system because it was easier to control revenue when the per-instrument charging system was used. Since the company had agreed to obtain a profit of 13 percent, it could settle for a profit of no more than 10 percent and no less than 10 percent under the existing system.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said that when the Special Telephone Committee discussed the reduction in the number of calls, it did not say that 37.5 percent was an exact and unchangeable number. This number was merely the average of the 50 percent reduction rate in Japan and the 25 percent reduction rate in the United Kingdom. However, at that time, the number of calls in the United Kingdom was not very high, so the impact after changing to the per-call charging system was small. Currently, Shanghai telephone users make a very high number of calls, so the reduction component in the future is extremely large. The extent of the future reduction will inevitably exceed 25 percent, or even reach 37.5 percent. Mr. Brown also said that the profit earned on the Shanghai Telephone Company's investment was not beyond the norm. The Copenhagen Telephone Company in Denmark had previously enjoyed an equivalent profit for as long as twenty years. The net profit earned annually by the various companies of the American Bell System was also consistently between eight and nine percent. Mr. Brown also said that the per-instrument charging system was absolutely unfair and caused many abuses. Furthermore, according to the experts, if the company's profit were to exceed one point in the future, the telephone charges could still be required to be reduced. Currently, because of the desire to adopt the per-call charging system, the number can only be approximate. On this point, it cannot be as accurate as under the per-instrument charging system. However, in view of the above reasons, this point is not important. But if the per-instrument charging system must still be used in the future, then the authorities will inevitably have to face an extremely large expenditure. At that time, it may be necessary to add a central switchboard with a capital of 30,000 yuan to meet the needs of a very high number of calls. The current equipment in the central area of the telephone company is sufficient to supply 10,000 users under normal conditions. However, due to the very high number of calls, there are many places where the supply is lacking. If the number of calls does not return to normal in the near future and the economic situation gradually improves, the company will have to add equipment for 10,000 lines in the business area.</p>
<p>The chairman then summarized the opinions of the various committee members and experts as follows: the company's revenue is easier to calculate under the per-instrument charging system than under the per-call charging system. However, the Telephone Special Committee felt that even under the per-call charging system, the calculation would not be very different. The committee members also felt that the benefits of the per-call charging system were more than enough to cover this concern, making it a truly viable option. The chairman reminded the committee members that before the experts came to Shanghai, the Shanghai Telephone Company, in its consultation with the Shanghai Municipal Council, had agreed that after the per-call charging system was implemented in the future, it would be willing to include the excess revenue earned in the telephone price revision account within one year. This plan could still be put forward to the company in the future, stipulating a trial period. It was expected that the company would not overturn the original agreement under the same conditions.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a committee member inquired about the reliability of the call counters. Mr. Brown said that among the various simple and indestructible mechanical structures, the telephone call counter was one of the most reliable. Chinese expert Mr. Hu Ruixiang further explained the content of this mechanical work and said that this machine only recorded the number of completed calls. According to Mr. Brown, the current average number of calls per day for Shanghai users is 11 for residential users and 18 for business users. He also said that after the implementation of the new system, 50 percent of business users and 59 percent of residential users would benefit as a result.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the current proposed per-call charging system is calculated based on the company's net profit of 8.54 percent, a committee member raised the clause in the concession contract that the company still has the right to include the shortfall in the telephone fee revision account. Mr. Brown said that all the experts were aware of this point.</p>
<p>The head of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department observed that after the implementation of the new system, the profit on the company's invested capital would be approximately 8.58 percent, and the shortfall would be included in the telephone fee revision item. However, the company would have many opportunities to improve in the future, so that the profit could be increased to 10 percent. When this goal could be achieved would depend entirely on future circumstances. Mr. Ray explained that if the number of telephones did not increase in the future, the company's profit might only reach 8 percent. However, if the number of telephones increased as expected, the company's profit would also be greater.</p>
<p>A committee member further inquired whether the installed telephone lines could be used for unlimited calls without restrictions. Mr. Brown said that was not the case. The monthly rental for the first line was 10 yuan, and the monthly fee for the second and subsequent lines was 5 yuan, without any included number of calls. Therefore, whether on the first line or on the other branch lines, only 150 calls could be made free of charge, and all others would be charged according to the number of calls.</p>
<p>The meeting came to an end at this point, and it was decided to reopen on November 7th. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Second Special District Federation Opposes Per-Call Telephone Billing <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Sends Another Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Requesting Measures to Prevent It; Otherwise, Refuse to Pay and Let Them Remove the Telephone</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Federation, regarding the telephone company's change in billing method to per-call billing, which citizens have expressed opposition to, had previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting them to prevent it, but had not received a reply. Yesterday, they sent another letter to the Council, requesting them to immediately take measures to prevent it. A reporter from the New New News Agency has extracted the original letter as follows: Dear Sirs, regarding the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase, our Federation had previously sent a letter to your Council requesting you to take measures to prevent it. Now we understand that the Telephone Expert Committee has completed its review, and its report has admitted that the Shanghai Telephone Company should obtain a net profit of 10 percent in fulfilling its franchise contract, and its billing method is that commercial telephones will be charged 10 yuan per month for 150 calls, and household telephones will be charged 6.5 yuan per month for 100 calls, and an additional 3 cents will be charged for each additional call. If calculated according to this number, commercial telephones are limited to 150 calls per month, with an average of only five calls per day, and household telephones are limited to 100 calls per month, with an average of less than four calls per day. However, how many more than five or four times a day are commercial and household telephones used? If the price is doubled, how much will the price increase be? If the price is tripled, how much will the price increase be? The economy is currently depressed, so how can people bear this heavy burden? Furthermore, the company's restriction on calls is so strict that if commercial and household users remove their telephones due to the low utility, or only keep one of two telephones, or use two-cent postage for communication, or take other measures because they cannot afford to exceed five or four times a day by several times, may we ask how the company will obtain a net profit of 10 percent? The Expert Committee has not taken this into account and has insisted on maintaining the company's 10 percent net profit as a prerequisite, and the company is only concerned about its own generous annual interest and does not consider whether users can afford it, acting stubbornly and without any relaxation. Our Federation, representing the citizens of the entire district, cannot agree to this plan in any way. If the company must implement per-call billing, then all users will have to refuse to pay and let them remove the telephones. As this matter concerns social welfare, we are sending another letter to your Council, requesting you to consider the public opinion of the citizens and not implement this per-call billing method in any way, so as to stabilize society and comply with public opinion.</p>

<p>This method of donation is convenient, can increase donations, and benefit the disaster victims immeasurably. According to inquiries, there has been a very enthusiastic response from automatic donations since its implementation. The Ta Chung Hua Match Company has successively paid 486.4 yuan in foreign currency, and the Chinese Cloth Exchange has paid 100 yuan. Such enthusiasm is truly admirable. It is hoped that all circles will donate generously to benefit the disaster victims and create boundless blessings. Furthermore, the city's Children's Corps' overall donation mobilization has been approved by the Municipal Government, and the Public Security Bureau's Security Division has been instructed to provide concrete protection. The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have been requested to protect it. The ninety-two days from the 9th of this month have been approved as the days for soliciting donations from all agencies, organizations, shops, and households in the city. The 11th to the 17th will be the days for soliciting donations from the Children's Corps' relatives and friends. However, street soliciting is absolutely avoided. The Water Disaster Relief Association and the Council of Army Chapters have already sent letters to the city's Education Bureau to forward to participate. During the solicitation period, the authorities of the Children's Corps schools will allow leave for students. It has now been stipulated that the number of people must be reported before the 6th of this month. On the 7th and 8th, the Children's Corps members participating in each team will go to the Children's Corps Council to collect donation receipts and promotional materials, and white Red Cross symbols have been printed and distributed to each working Children's Corps member for identification. It is hoped that all circles will generously contribute and benefit the disaster victims, creating immeasurable blessings.</p>

<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Another Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council on Behalf of China-France Pharmacy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taxpayers Association of the Chinese Concession sent a letter to the Acting General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, regarding the donation case of the China-France Pharmacy Co., Ltd., after receiving your Council's reply B535 of October 16, we immediately forwarded it to the company. Now, according to their reply of October 29, we would like to draw your Council's attention to the following facts: (1) When general rents are high, the rent for self-produced and self-used properties can be estimated high. Conversely, when general rents are low, the rent for self-produced and self-used properties should be reduced. (2) All rent reductions are notified to the Shanghai Taxpayers Association or directly to the Municipal Council by letter in accordance with the law, and the total amount of donation is reduced accordingly. (3) The Cotton Mill Association has requested the Taxpayers Association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council to reduce the estimated rent. (4) There is also a court judgment reducing rent by 20 percent, as seen in various newspapers. (5) Our office has paid the total donation in accordance with the law for the reasonable amount of rent, but it has been rejected by the Donation Office. Based on the above reasons, the pharmacy does not change its previous claims, but does not neglect the opportunity for a truly independent and legally based rent valuation. We are sending this letter to your Council for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Rampant Bandits in Zhejiang Sea Fishing Area: Fishermen Telegraph Shanghai for Help <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>More Than Twenty Fishing Boats Looted: Request for Patrol Ships to Rescue</p>
<p>The Shenjiamen Fishery Association of Zhejiang and other fishermen's organizations sent a telegram to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Industry's Fishery Protection Bureau yesterday, stating that piracy is rampant during the fishing season, with a large number of fishing boats being looted, making it extremely urgent to send patrol ships to protect the fishing grounds and simultaneously dispatch troops to directly attack the bandit hideouts and rescue the fishermen in distress. The association recently received reports from fishermen that on the afternoon of October 21st, more than twenty pairs of fishing boats, including those of Zhang Xiaoniang, Chen Qingtang, Jiang Axiao, Bei Fusheng, Xia Dingxing, and Xin Yunqing, were looted by bandits in the Guanshan sea area. Both the people and boats were kidnapped, and the fishing gear was completely devastated. The bandit leader, Jin Shunan, Huang Chunshan, threatened that after receiving the message, they must go to the designated location to negotiate ransom, otherwise the boats would be destroyed and the hostages killed. Their rampant and stubborn wickedness is such as this. According to the association's report, there are no patrol ships in the fishing area and no ships to pursue the bandits on the spot. Public security on the water is full of difficulties, and fishermen's livelihoods are becoming more and more difficult. This year, the money spent on going to sea for boat pairs, purchasing tools, and all the costs of the boats are entirely from pawning possessions. They are doing it reluctantly, only wanting to seek enough food and clothing for their families amidst difficulties. If the fishing area is where bandits can be encountered everywhere, then the families of the victims are crying to the heavens and the rest of the boat pairs are in imminent danger. Therefore, we urgently request that patrol ships be dispatched quickly to the fishing area to provide effective patrols. At the same time, send troops to pursue and suppress the bandits and rescue the distressed people.</p>

<p>Xu, née Xu, a 36-year-old woman from Shaoxing, residing at No. 153 Zhaoyang Road, Pudong, had a husband, Xu Changtai, who made a meager living selling newspapers. They had four children, all young, making life extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Xu suddenly fell ill a decade ago, but they could not afford medical treatment. Her condition worsened in recent days, and she could not get out of bed. In this situation, she was resentful and conceived the idea of ending her life. Taking advantage of the absence of her husband and children by her bedside, she grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed herself in the neck. The blood vessels were severed, and she bled profusely. After her husband and others discovered her, they rushed her to the hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The Yangshupu Police Station was notified and dispatched an officer to investigate. The body was taken to the Phalen Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue. After examining the body and questioning her husband, Xu Changtai, about the circumstances, Guo determined that the deceased Xu, née Xu, a woman, had indeed committed suicide by slitting her throat.

<h3 id="e79">Check Bounced Despite Funds in Bank <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Sheng Zhiren Sues Xi Hanying for Damage to Credit</p>
<p>Sheng Zhiren, a resident of No. 8 Dingji Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, a member of the former French Concession Business Association, and a native of Changzhou, deposited funds in the name of Zhi Ji into the China Bank Baxianqiao Branch on Rue Cardinal Mercier, French Concession, and has been doing so for six years. As of the end of July this year, Sheng's deposit balance was 120 yuan. On August 3rd, he deposited 190 yuan and paid out 163 yuan, leaving a balance of 147 yuan. The next day (August 4th), Sheng issued a check for 104 yuan to another person, who then transferred it to the Shanghai Bank for collection. However, Xi Hanying, the accounting director of the China Bank Baxianqiao Branch, a native of Suzhou, had a grudge against Sheng and refused to pay the check, bouncing it. The next day, when the check was presented again, it was still rejected. Xi even wrote "Come tomorrow to collect the numbers" on the returned check slip. Sheng Zhiren believed that the amount of the deposit exceeded the amount of the check and that the procedures were complete. He suspected that Xi Hanying deliberately made things difficult. After going to the bank to lodge a complaint, he was able to cash the check. Sheng, as a businessman, regards credit as the only essential element of business. His deposit exceeded the amount of the check, yet it was unjustly bounced and refused to be cashed, which he believed was a deliberate attempt to damage his reputation. Feeling aggrieved, he filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Xi Hanying of the crime of damaging credit under Article 313 of the new Criminal Code, requesting the court to investigate and prosecute him according to law, and attaching a civil lawsuit requesting the court to order the defendant to publish an apology advertisement to restore his reputation. The court accepted the case and heard it in the Second Criminal Court at 11:00 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Sun Pengham. The defendant did not appear, only the plaintiff Sheng Zhiren was present. After briefly questioning his age and origin, the court informed the plaintiff that the subpoena for the defendant Xi Hanying had not yet been served. According to the bailiff's report, the bank stated that the defendant had resigned. Sheng was also unaware of the defendant's address and suspected that he had been transferred to the head office. The court also stated that the legal article cited by the plaintiff in the complaint did not correspond to the facts and ordered him to correct it immediately, and ordered a 15-day adjournment, ordering the plaintiff to summon the defendant for further questioning.</p>

<p>Hu Jinmei Unable to Resist Li Jiagen's Inhumanity</p>
<p>Hu Jinmei, a girl from Jiangbei, is 17 years old and lives at No. 1021 Binlang Road, West Shanghai. She works as a factory worker at the Japanese-owned Naigaiwata No. 13 Factory on Robison Road. A few days ago, Hu was engaged to Yuan Jiasheng, a worker at the Peicheng Sock Factory on Seymour Road, through a matchmaker. However, Hu's elder sister had already been promised to a man surnamed Mou from their Jiangbei hometown, and the wedding was scheduled to take place within days. Therefore, Hu's parents and sisters returned to their hometown together the day before yesterday to prepare everything, leaving only Hu Jinmei alone to look after the house in Shanghai. When Hu's parents left, because Jinmei was young and inexperienced, they instructed Jinmei's fiancé, Yuan Jiasheng, to take care of her. Unexpectedly, Li Jiagen, a man from Anhui (also known as Li Changgen, 43 years old), residing at No. 6 Xiaoshadu Road, who was acquainted with the Hu family, broke into the Hu's house alone at around 7:00 in the morning the day before yesterday. At that time, Hu Jinmei had just returned home from working the night shift, having finished work at 6:00 in the morning, and was preparing to sleep. Seeing Li's arrival, she greeted him. After some conversation, Li learned that Hu's entire family had returned to their hometown, leaving only Jinmei alone in the house. He had bad intentions and went out to buy a few pieces of Cifan (a type of glutinous rice snack) and copper coins, asking Jinmei to eat them and coaxing her with sweet words. He then closed the door and forcibly pushed Hu Jinmei onto the bed, covering her head with a quilt to prevent her from making a sound, and committed indecent assault. Hu was helpless and alone, and under the force of violence, she was unable to resist and was ravaged. At around 8:00, her fiancé, Yuan Jiasheng, and the matchmaker, Zhang Yuancai, went to visit her and saw that the door was tightly closed. They knocked on the door. At that time, Li Jiagen and Hu were fast asleep. Suddenly hearing the knock, they were shocked. Li climbed out of the window and onto the cabinet outside the window, hoping to escape. Suddenly, the second landlord, Jin Qiangen, saw him and suspected that he was a thief, so he shouted loudly. Neighbors gathered. Seeing that the situation was not good, Li turned around and fled back into Hu's room. By this time, Hu had opened the door, and Li was seized by Yuan and others, twisted over to Chinese patrol, and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. Under the questioning of Chinese detective Zhang Liang, Hu, out of shame, did not reveal the truth, so the detectives initially did not know the real story. Li, on the other hand, accused Yuan of stealing his hat. Later, after questioning by Chinese and Western detectives, Hu Jinmei confessed to the ordeal she had suffered. The police then searched Hu's house and found stained trousers and two bed sheets, which they took back to the police station. They sent Hu to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that her hymen had been broken. They ordered Li to be detained and transferred to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him under Article 221 of the Criminal Code and presented the case. Judge Liu Yugui declared that the case concerned morality and prohibited spectators from attending. As a result, Judge Liu declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 7th of this month.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Sun Jinshi, an elderly woman from Ningbo, 58 years old, came to Shanghai with her son, Fucai (30 years old), on September 14th, staying at the home of her son-in-law, Xin Xingkuan, No. 89 McCot Road, to find business opportunities for her son. However, there were no suitable jobs. Later, the mother suddenly fell ill and became increasingly ill, but the Xin family was unable to afford medical treatment and only prayed to Buddha and took herbal remedies. Unexpectedly, she died at 5:00 pm on the 27th of last month. Sun Fucai was furious and took advantage of the opportunity to use a knife to stab a hole in his mother's abdomen. He reported to the Hongkou Police Station, saying that his mother had been murdered by her brother-in-law, Xin Xingkuan, and stabbed to death, demanding justice. After the case was filed, Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Jihuang and Detective Zi Baimingfu escorted him to the First Special District Court. Sun Jinshi's body was clearly examined by the prosecutor and forensic doctor, confirming that she had died of illness. Sun Fucai's interrogation and detention have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that there was a witness who could prove the situation after Sun Jinshi's death and that the defendant had falsely accused Xin Xingkuan, etc. According to his nephew, Xin Fuquan, after Sun Jinshi's death, the defendant came with four friends and took the opportunity to make trouble, accusing his uncle of murder, etc. According to Yong woman Jiang Ye, who worked as a servant in the Xu family, relatives of Xin, after Sun Jinshi's death, she went to the Xin family to help and washed the body with hot water, and there was no knife wound or hole in the abdomen. At that time, the defendant was also watching clearly, etc. When questioned, the defendant still stammered in his confession. Judge Jiang ruled that Sun Fucai was guilty of damaging the corpse of a direct blood relative and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Lawyers Association Requests Investigation into the Removal of Written Records <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Shen Yuankai Suspected of Destroying Evidence</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday, stating that it was submitting a report from Yuan Sunpinlian, reporting that Cheng Shen Yuankai, trial officer of the Qingpu County Government, had suppressed evidence and requesting a thorough investigation. According to the letter from Yuan Sunpinlian of Lupu, he filed a lawsuit with the Jiangsu Qingpu County Government against Sun Chuanhui for the analysis of the inheritance, and was sentenced in September of the 23rd year. Yuan appealed to the High Court because he did not accept the original judgment. However, on March 4th of this year, during the second hearing in the High Court, it was discovered that the file of the Qingpu County Government regarding this case was missing a written record of the court hearing on April 27th of the 23rd year, claiming that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant were present in court on that day. The attorney for Mr. Chen, Attorney Chen, told the presiding judge that "When the Qingpu County Government heard this case on that day, the husband of a person from the asylum attended and took notes. This is a fact that cannot be ignored and was removed by the trial officer because he saw testimony that was unfavorable to the person from the asylum." And asked the clerk to record this matter in the court hearing record. The importance of the record lies in the testimony of Xu Shenhou, the witness presented by Sun Chuanhui. Xu only attended court once in this case, which was on April 27th of the 23rd year. Trial officer Shen Zushou was transferred to Taicang and succeeded by Shen Yuankai. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish who removed the record. After detailed research, it was discovered that the person who removed the record was actually Shen Yuankai. (Omitted) There is also a judgment from the Qingpu County Government as proof. This kind of suppression of evidence, dereliction of duty and perversion of the law, and the destruction of official documents are incompatible with the spirit of the rule of law and cannot be tolerated by today's movement to rectify official discipline. In addition to filing a complaint with the Ministry of Judicial Administration, I am humbly seeking your association's assistance to present this matter to a meeting and request the Jiangsu High Court to transfer Shen Yuankai for disciplinary action and dismissal. After the association submitted the matter to a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee, it was resolved to submit it to your ministry for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Unresolved Wang Yaochen Estate Dispute: Lu Xingyuan Sues Qiu Hanping <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Accusations of False Accusation, Incitement to False Accusation, and Defamation: The First Special Court Summoned Lu Yesterday for Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>Wang Yaochen, also known as Wang Yousu, a native of Xiamen, Fujian, who held dual nationality by retaining his original nationality while registering as a French citizen, passed away on November 18th of last year at his residence, No. 7, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, in this city. During his final illness, he specifically requested lawyer Lu Xingyuan to come to his home and sign a will at his bedside, entrusting it to his concubine, Du Ruizhen, for safekeeping. He also asked his friend, Shi Zhinan (also known as Shi Yuankai), who was then serving as an assistant at the Salt Revenue Audit Office, to be the executor of the will. After his death, his wife from his ancestral home, Ouyang Shunying, along with his son Wang Shengduan, published a statement in the newspaper declaring that all of Wang Yaochen's</p>
<p>Property in Shanghai and Xiamen</p>
<p>was to be inherited by his wife and son. Anyone with objections was to provide evidence within two weeks. However, Du Ruizhen did not respond to Ouyang's statement at the time. It was not until March 17th of this year that she instructed her nephew, Wang Sheng, to send a letter to the French Consulate in Xiamen requesting the registration of Wang Yaochen's will so that she could inherit all of Yaochen's estate. When Ouyang learned of this, she vehemently opposed it, and the French Consulate did not</p>
<p>Approve the Registration, leading to Litigation between the two parties in the Xiamen</p>
<p>Courts.</p>
<p>However, Du soon mortgaged and sold the land on Route Tenant de Béhaine in the French Concession of this city, which further aroused Ouyang's resentment. Last month, she hired lawyer Qiu Hanping to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against Du Ruizhen, Lu Xingyuan, Shi Zhinan, and others, alleging that the will was a forgery concocted by Du and the others. Du Ruizhen was accused of violating Articles 210, 216, 217, and 320, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, Lu Xingyuan was accused of violating Articles 210, 217, and 215 of the Criminal Code, and Shi Zhinan was accused of violating Article 30 of the Criminal Code, requesting</p>
<p>Legal Punishment</p>
<p>and ordering the return of the stolen and sold land. The First Special Court has already conducted two preliminary hearings involving Lu and Shi. Lu and Shi, arguing that Ouyang Shunying should not have sued them, also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The presiding judge, Mr. Xiao Fen, ordered a postponement, stating that an investigation was needed from the Xiamen District Court, and further questioning would be conducted upon the Xiamen Court's response, as previously reported in detail. It has now been learned that, in addition to joining Shi Zhinan in counter-suing</p>
<p>Ouyang Shunying</p>
<p>for false accusation in that case, lawyer Lu Xingyuan has now independently filed a criminal self-accusation against lawyer Qiu Hanping, who drafted the complaint for Ouyang, on three counts: (1) false accusation, (2) incitement to false accusation, and (3) defamation. Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special Court, who is handling the case, summoned the plaintiff, Lu Xingyuan, to court yesterday afternoon for a preliminary hearing to understand the meaning of his accusations. According to Lu's statement, the false accusation he accused Qiu Hanping of was based on Qiu's report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station on September 3rd, on behalf of Ouyang Shunying, accusing us of conspiring to</p>
<p>Forge a Will.</p>
<p>He accused him of inciting false accusation because the complaint filed by Wang Ouyang Shunying against Du Ruizhen, me, and Shi Zhinan for forging private documents was drafted by Qiu Hanping. The reason for accusing him of defamation was that Qiu should not have disclosed the drafted complaint to newspapers. When the case of Ouyang's self-accusation of forging private documents was heard, Ouyang stated the facts of the prosecution in court but did not mention the legal articles under which the defendant was accused. However, the next day, various newspapers carried</p>
<p>Reports of the Hearing</p>
<p>detailing each defendant's alleged violations of the law, which were completely identical to those described in the original complaint, indicating that Qiu Hanping had leaked the complaint. The fact that Wang Yaochen signed the will had previously been testified to in court by Shi Zhinan and witnesses. Therefore, Ouyang's false accusation will certainly be substantiated in the future, he said. He then presented newspapers, judgments from the Xiamen court, and photos of Wang Yaochen's handwriting as evidence, claiming that they were all sufficient to prove that the signature on the will was indeed Wang's. After examining the evidence, Judge Wu ordered a postponement to the afternoon of November 19th for further questioning.</p>

However, they lacked the opportunity. Recently, while Dr. Wang Zhengting was in Shanghai, he and Mr. Du Yuesheng happily invited Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Liu Yunfang, and others to visit the factory. They were warmly received by the factory manager, Mr. Lin Chaopin, who led them on a tour of the various departments.

<p>Guarantees Must Be Completed Within Two Months; One Person's Crime, Three People Punished</p>
<p>The central government is strictly enforcing the prohibition of opium and drugs. All employees of various ships are required to obtain a three-person joint guarantee to prevent the smuggling of drugs and the provision of opium for smoking. This has now been announced in Shanghai. The Shanghai Marine Engineer's Union has copied and distributed the guarantee rules to all crew members for compliance. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "Greetings, we have received a letter from Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, stating that the members Ning Shaosan, Beida Xing, and other companies have reported that they have received a dispatch from the Administrative Inspector of the Ning County Administrative Inspectorate District of Zhejiang Province, along with the Regulations on Joint Guarantees to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Provision of Opium and Drugs by Crew Members of Various Ships in Zhejiang Province, and a sample of the Joint Guarantee Pledge, instructing all ships to comply. Prohibition of opium must be complied with. In addition to instructing the crew members of each ship to comply with the joint guarantee rules, there may be misunderstandings among the crew members due to a lack of understanding of the facts. We request that the union forward a letter to the various maritime groups for simultaneous assistance to facilitate progress and avoid violations of orders. Previously, the Regulations on Joint Guarantees to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Provision of Opium and Drugs by Crew Members of Various Ships in Zhejiang Province have been submitted to the Chairman of the Military Commission and Superintendent General of Opium Suppression for approval and implementation, which should be complied with. In response to the previous situation, we have enclosed a copy of the joint guarantee rules and a sample of the pledge for your reference and forwarding to the relevant members for compliance, etc. We have also included a copy of the joint guarantee rules and a sample of the pledge. In response to this, the transportation and provision of opium and drugs are strictly prohibited by national law. These joint guarantee rules must be complied with. We have issued a copy of the joint guarantee rules and three copies of the joint guarantee pledge and request that your members promptly find joint guarantors, fill them out, and submit them to the association for submission to the central management agency for filing. (Regulations on Joint Guarantees to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Provision of Opium and Drugs by Crew Members of Various Ships in Zhejiang Province (Article 1) In order to strictly prohibit the transportation or provision of opium and drugs in this province, these Regulations on Joint Guarantees to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Provision of Opium and Drugs by Crew Members of Various Ships are specifically formulated. All ships shall order all crew members to comply. (Article 2) All crew members of each ship shall jointly associate in groups of three and shall not transport or provide lamps for smoking opium and drugs. If any member of the joint guarantee is found to be transporting or providing opium and drugs on the ship and it is confirmed, if the perpetrator escapes, the co-guarantors shall be responsible for handing over the person. Each crew member may only join one joint guarantee. All guarantors shall be employees of similar rank, and if there are not three employees of similar rank, adjustments may be made according to the circumstances. (Article 3) If a guarantor knows that any member of the joint guarantee is transporting or providing lamps for smoking opium and drugs, they shall secretly report it in a timely manner. If the report is confirmed to be true, the reporting person shall be exempt from liability and shall find another joint guarantee. (Article 4) If any member of the joint guarantee suspects that a guarantor is transporting or providing lamps for smoking opium and drugs, they may state their withdrawal from the guarantee at any time. After withdrawal, the original guarantor shall find another joint guarantee within ten days. (Article 5) If any member of the joint guarantee is promoted, demoted, resigns, withdraws, or dies, the guarantors shall find another joint guarantee within ten days. (Article 6) If any member of the joint guarantee is found to be transporting or providing lamps for smoking opium and drugs and it is confirmed to be true, in addition to dismissing all co-guarantors and confiscating their security deposit, the perpetrator of the transportation or provision of lamps for smoking opium and drugs shall be handed over to the legal authorities for handling according to law. (Article 7) After the implementation of these regulations, each ship shall complete the procedures within two months and submit the list of joint guarantees to the shipping bureau for submission to the competent authorities for filing. Subsequent joint guarantees shall be reported at any time. Any ship that fails to provide guarantees in accordance with the rules within the time limit shall be ordered by the shipping bureau to suspend their duties.

The Northern Government feared him and offered a reward of 100,000 gold coins. The martyr was martyred and sacrificed for the revolution. Dr. Sun Yat-sen praised him as a model death. Martyr Xia made great achievements in his life, and many important figures in the Party and the country, such as Li Liejun, Xiong Shihui, and Cao Haosen, were among his disciples.

The tugboat arrived, but it was not needed. The grounding lasted about ten hours, and the ship has now resumed its voyage to Hankou as usual.</p>

<p>House: The Tongtaiqing carpentry workshop, located at 750 Route Lafayette in the French Concession and opened by Zhou Liangqing, has a flat-roofed facade with a vacant lot in the back filled with pine wood. At 9:45 p.m. last night, a spark flew into the wood shavings, causing thick smoke and flames to erupt, engulfing all the wood. The loss is estimated at 700 to 800 yuan.

Due to carelessness with fire, the fire quickly spread to the cotton, and the situation became uncontrollable. Fortunately, the fire brigade was nearby and quickly dispatched a pumper truck to extinguish the fire. Firefighters unloaded the cotton, and only half of it was destroyed. The truck was undamaged.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Two Robbery Cases <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Fanwangdu: As winter approaches and the weather turns cold, the north wind has been raging for days, making it feel even colder. Even with cotton clothing, it still feels thin at night. Therefore, those driven by hunger and cold are resorting to desperate measures, resulting in frequent robberies throughout the city and frequent police reports. At approximately 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning, five robbers speaking with a Jiangbei accent and wearing blue and black cloth short shirts and trousers went to rob the home of Gong Yingzong, a local resident at 1340 behind St. John's University in Fanwangdu, West Shanghai. Only two of the robbers had pistols. They tore down a section of the fence built outside Gong's house, smashed the glass window of the inner room, and removed the window latch, entering through the window. At that time, Gong and his family had already been awakened from their sleep and were about to get up when the robbers entered the house. They were unable to resist and were all robbed and imprisoned, with one robber guarding them with a gun. The remaining robbers began searching the house and left after about ten minutes, fleeing north. After checking the losses, it was found that more than 180 yuan in cash, silk, woolen clothes, and other items had been stolen. The case was reported to the Guangfulu Substation of the Caojiadu Branch Bureau and a request was made for pursuit and arrest.</p>
<p>Zhoujiazui Road: A family surnamed Mou at 56, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road was robbed by several robbers at approximately 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening. The victims were guarded by armed robbers while the remaining robbers searched the house. After about twenty minutes, they left with their spoils.

<p>The detention center of the Second Special District Court on Xuehuali Road had previously borrowed a portion of the buildings in the Second Special District Prison on Maqinannan Road as a detention center for unconvicted criminals due to the small size of the detention center (below the court of the Second Special Court). It was divided into east and west sections. However, the prisoners were disrespectful of the law and often quarreled and fought. Those who were transferred to the Second Special Court for punishment have been numerous. Yesterday at noon, several prisoners in the east section quarreled and fought over the uneven distribution of quilts due to the cold weather. The guards on duty were unable to stop them and immediately reported to the duty officer and warden, who in turn reported to the nearby Lujiawan Central Police Station. The captain and vice-captain led more than ten Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the disturbance, which was finally stopped. After an investigation, one of the ringleaders was identified, taken to the west section, shackled, and detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Groups of Vagrants Stealing Affect Rural Areas Significantly</p>
<p>Due to the continuous rainstorms in the spring and summer of this year, the growth of cotton and rice planted in the farmland of the four townships of Wusong was delayed, resulting in a poor autumn harvest. Even now, the cotton bolls have not fully opened. Unemployed vagrants believe that the time has come and are forming groups to steal fallen cotton everywhere, which has a significant impact on rural areas. In light of this, the Wusong District Farmers' Association has requested the police to issue a notice to strictly prohibit the practice. The notice reads as follows: "In response to a letter from the Shanghai Wusong District Farmers' Association, based on a report from farmers stating that 'It is often the case at the beginning of winter in each district that a general public of unemployed people goes to the various villages to pick cotton (commonly known as catching fallen cotton). This autumn, the cotton harvests in each village have been poor, and most of the bolls have not yet opened. If this is not prohibited, it will have a significant impact on the future of the rural areas. Therefore, we request that you investigate and approve the issuance of a strict prohibition to maintain agriculture, etc.' If you continue to pick cotton or are reported, you will be severely punished once the investigation is complete. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. Deng Zhiyi, Director."</p>

During the fire at the Bailianjing Gongmao Machine Shipbuilding Factory, due to its location in the neighborhood, Mr. Shi, the chief engineer of the factory, was the first to discover the fire and led all the guards and employees in bravely fighting the fire, preventing it from spreading to other areas.

<p>The male and female actors of the Shanghai Theater returned with accolades after performing the musical "Xi Shi" in Nanjing and Hangzhou. Originally, they planned to actively rehearse plays such as "Self-Salvation" to meet the demands of various parties. However, because the Golden City Grand Theater repeatedly sent letters requesting the theater's actors to restage the nationally renowned "Modern Lady" for two days, it was decided that from today onward, there would be two performances each day. The afternoon show will begin at 2:30 PM, and the evening show will begin at 9:15 PM. Those who are captivated by the Modern Lady should not miss this opportunity again.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Letter <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Having read in the local news column of your newspaper on October 31st a report on the Hu Nanshan Tang pharmacy's accidental dispensing of the wrong prescription, although the content is purely a record of court testimony, the headline "Hu Nanshan Tang Pharmacy Accidentally Dispenses Wrong Prescription" seems inaccurate. Furthermore, the words "accidentally dispenses wrong prescription" are in extra-large font, which is eye-catching and creates the impression that the pharmacy is negligent in its business. Before the truth is clarified, it is hoped that such a loss of reputation can be avoided. Moreover, Hu Nanshan's accusation against Ding Jinrong et al. for extortion also has its own reasonable basis. In the future, when the truth comes to light, it may elicit sighs from people in society about the difficulty of opening a pharmacy. At this time, when the turbulent waves of recession are raging, people's hearts are difficult to fathom with normal sentiment. We have always admired your newspaper's upholding of fairness and justice. Therefore, we specially submit this request, hoping for your clear discernment and that you will kindly publish this letter in the correspondence column. We would be endlessly grateful. Sincerely, the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association, November 5th, to the esteemed chief editor of local news at Shen Bao.</p>

The Service has been collecting a considerable amount of information on various industrial and commercial sectors as part of its mission. Going forward, we plan to publish articles in this publication on a weekly basis, each focusing on a specific industry or commercial sector, with the aim of systematically providing readers with the latest information on the realities of industry and commerce, the causes of successes and failures, and future trends, in order to contribute our humble knowledge. However, given the magnitude of the subject, omissions and errors are inevitable. We hope that all sectors will correct and teach us. We would be immensely grateful.</p>
<p>A Brief Overview of Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Over the Past Three Years</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>According to credit information services and other statistical agencies in various countries, there are statistics on "Business Failure" and "New Capital Issue." To assess the general trends in the rise and fall of industry and commerce, one can use price indices and market experience for estimation. However, to further study the reasons for the successes and failures of various industries, future trends, and the mutual influence between various industries, one must focus on the aforementioned two statistics. Since its establishment, the Service has also paid considerable attention to collecting this information. However, among businesses in various countries, most of those with some scale are corporate organizations, and the issuance of stocks and bonds is documented in official records. The situation in China's industrial and commercial sector is different. Corporate organizations are few in number, and most stores are unregistered. It is nearly impossible to gather statistics on new capital issues. The "business failure" category is easily confused by terms such as "reorganization" and "capital increase." Strictly speaking, "reorganization" and "capital increase" can be said to encompass the dissolution of old businesses and the establishment of new businesses. In reality, the situation is not as severe as it appears. After careful consideration, our colleagues have listed the standards for data collection as three categories: new establishments, reorganizations, and closures. While the "reorganization" category is not as severe as "closures," reorganizations inevitably increase during market downturns, and their trend is generally similar to closures, with minor differences. This article will analyze and study the number of new establishments, reorganizations, and closures of Shanghai's industrial and commercial businesses from 1933 to June of this year. The data collection methods mainly rely on various daily newspapers, supplemented by the Service's regular investigations. Small-scale new establishments and closures that are not reported in newspapers and that have no dealings with the financial industry are likely to be overlooked. In addition, data collection methods have been significantly improved over the years, which may also affect the numbers. We hope readers will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>II. Changes in Figures Over the Past Three Years</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the global economic panic in 1929, China has presented an appearance of prosperity due to the protection of low silver prices. However, as the global economic panic deepened, with the "September 18th Incident" in Shenyang and the "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai externally, and the abandonment of the gold standard by various countries, resulting in a rebound in silver prices, and internal natural disasters of floods and droughts and frequent disturbances, the national economy was severely affected. The manifestations of this were particularly evident in Shanghai. The changes in figures over the past three years are listed in the table below for comparison:</p>
<p>New Establishments Reorganizations Closures</p>
<p>1933 100 100 100</p>
<p>1934 80.40 2,116.14 171.05</p>
<p>1935 54.87 3,054.53 233.71</p>
<p>Using the average monthly figures for 1933 as a base, the rise and fall of the change index over the past three years is as follows...</p>
<p>As shown in the table on the right, the new establishment index has declined annually in the past three years. Compared to 1933, the new establishment index has decreased by 45.13%, the closure index has increased by more than two times, and the reorganization index has increased dramatically to more than thirty times.</p>
<p>The detailed monthly change figures for the entire year of 1934 and the first six months of this year are listed below (unit: one business):</p>
<p>New Establishments Reorganizations Closures</p>
<p>January 1934 10 92 118</p>
<p>February 4 41 117</p>
<p>March 17 217 33</p>
<p>April 13 143 36</p>
<p>May 11 118 46</p>
<p>June 20 130 33</p>
<p>July 6 81 25</p>
<p>August 9 81 34</p>
<p>September 100 100 32</p>
<p>New Establishments Reorganizations Closures</p>
<p>January 1935 10 115 54</p>
<p>February 4 155 51</p>
<p>March 14 192 3</p>
<p>April 11 160 14</p>
<p>May 4 158 45</p>
<p>June 5 151 53</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>August</p>
<p>September</p>
<p>New Establishments Reorganizations Closures</p>
<p>October 1934 14 137 33</p>
<p>November 14 59 24</p>
<p>December 11 15 15</p>
<p>Total 147 1290 366</p>
<p>New Establishments Reorganizations Closures</p>
<p>Total for the first half of the year 48 931 250</p>
<p>According to the above table, the most new establishments in 1934 were in June and March, and in the first half of 1935, they were in March and April. The most reorganizations in 1934 were in March, April, and October, and in the first half of 1935, they were in March and April. The most closures in 1934 were in May and August, and in the first half of 1935, they were in January and June. In the past, changes often occurred during seasonal closures, but now this seasonality seems to have been lost. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>One evening, a cool breeze was blowing, and the children were all asleep except for the older ones who were still bathing by the creek. Mrs. Pei was in the sitting room undressing Tandy when suddenly he shouted, "Ah, my Donald!" pointing to the moonlit window.</p>
<p>"No, darling, he's not there; that's just the beautiful moon," his mother said.</p>
<p>"No, no, Donald is at a window; Tandy saw him," the little boy insisted, looking very excited.</p>
<p>"That may be possible," Mrs. Pei said, rushing to the window, hoping to confirm the child's words. But there was no face, and not a trace of anyone could be found. She called his name, took Tandy, who was only wearing a small undershirt, to the front door, and had him call out too, thinking that the little boy's voice might be louder than hers. But there was no answer, and nothing could be found. So, they returned dejectedly. However, Tandy didn't think it was just the moon, so after he was already asleep in his little bed, he would still look up from time to time and ask, "Is Donald 'coming back soon'?"</p>
<p>Soon he fell asleep, the children all went to bed, and the house gradually became quiet, only occasionally broken by the chirping of crickets disturbing the peaceful night. Mrs. Pei sat doing sewing work, because the large basket was always full of socks with holes big enough to swallow an elephant. At the same time, she was thinking about the lost child. She decided that the little boy was wrong, so she didn't go to tell Mr. Pei, lest the child's fantasy interrupt his work. After all, when did that poor man ever have any time to himself except after the children were in bed? He was busy writing letters. It was already after ten o'clock when she stood up to close the door of the house. She couldn't help but linger a moment on the steps, admiring the lovely scene. Suddenly, she noticed something white on one of the many haystacks scattered on the lawn, something she didn't recognize. The children had been playing there all afternoon, and Mrs. Pei assumed it was just Nan's discarded white hat, so she went to retrieve it. But as she approached, she saw that it was not a hat or a handkerchief, but just a shirt sleeve, with a yellowed hand sticking out. She ran over to the haystack, and there slept Don, sleeping soundly.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Yesterday's Basketball Friendly Match: Hujiang Fought Hard Against Guanghua <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Hujiang Won 26-24</p>
<p>The Outcome Was Determined in Overtime; Guanghua Lost by One Point</p>
<p>Guanghua and Hujiang Middle Schools held a basketball friendly match at the Guanghua gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The referee was Lu Xiangqian. In the first half, Hujiang took a commanding lead with 17-4. Unexpectedly, at the start of the second half, Guanghua's new forces entered the field, making a rapid comeback. By the end of regulation time, the score was tied at 22-22. After both sides agreed to extend the game by five minutes, Hujiang finally secured the final victory by two points. The game was full of twists and turns, and the atmosphere was tense. A reporter from Guoguang News Agency has the following report:</p>
<p>In the First Half, Hujiang Took the Lead</p>
<p>Just after 3:00 PM, the match began. Hujiang's left forward, Chen Weiquan, went straight up the side, making a short pass. Center Tang Baojia caught it perfectly, and with a wave of his hand, hit the target. In less than a minute, Tang Baojia scored again, and Hu Qipeng added to the momentum with another point. Hujiang had already scored six points, while Guanghua had achieved nothing. They had no choice but to call a timeout and bring in substitute players. However, Hujiang's momentum was strong, and a mere cup of water could not save a burning cart of firewood. Guanghua's new player, Ouyang Ming, didn't make any contributions after being brought in, and was instead penalized for a foul, losing a point. Hujiang pressed forward relentlessly, taking a huge lead with a score of 17-0. At that time, there were only about three minutes left in the first half. Guanghua quickly brought in Chao Jianzhang to take on the important role of center. Sure enough, he scored a direct hit, breaking the duck egg. Zhang Fuyuan disregarded his own safety and made another miraculous contribution, ending the first half with a score of 17-4 in Hujiang's overwhelming victory.</p>
<p>Guanghua Worked Hard and Tied the Score</p>
<p>The second half began, and Hujiang's Sa Fengquan and Lu Zhongyu retired after their accomplishments. Guanghua suddenly became enlightened, and their passing and shooting became effortless. Zhang Dangyuan and Zhang Yaoqin stepped up without hesitation, scoring six points in a row. Hujiang only had the new player Kang Guogan score a point from a free throw, and Tang Baojia score two points from a long shot. After that, it was all about Guanghua. Ye Wensheng, Gu Liangren, Zhang Fuyuan, and others rode and galloped together, all making contributions, adding another eight points. At this time, the score was extremely close, with only a two-point difference. The atmosphere in the stands was tense to the extreme. Hujiang's general Tang Baojia had been tightly marked by Guanghua, and the hero had no place to show his skills. Fortunately, left forward Chen Weiquan suddenly emerged as a surprise force, making a contribution and returning. Guanghua's Xie Zongming and Ye Wensheng, seeing the imminent danger, scored two goals in a row, restoring Guanghua. The regulation time had arrived, with Guanghua at 18 and Hujiang at five. The overall result was a tie at 22-22.</p>
<p>In Overtime, Hujiang Declared Victory</p>
<p>The game was extended by five minutes. At this time, both sides went back and forth, refusing to give in. Guanghua, seeing that the crisis had passed, was unwilling to lose the city again. Hujiang was careful and cautious. Three minutes passed, and neither side scored. Guanghua's right guard, Ye Wensheng, roared loudly and actually scored, causing a burst of cheers like firecrackers. However, Guanghua's joy was short-lived. In a moment of carelessness, Hujiang's Tang Baojia broke free from his shackles and tied the score again. There were still three seconds left. Guanghua was full of hope that nothing would happen, but unexpectedly, Sa Fengquan approached the city and with a wave of his hand, the ball fell into the net. The whistle blew, ending the game. The ball happened to go into the basket. The overall result was 26-24, with Hujiang winning. Yesterday's performance of both sides is as follows:</p>

It has been decided that they will take the express train to Suzhou this morning at 8:00 AM. All travel expenses and other costs for both teams will be borne by Mr. Wu Silan personally, and all ticket sales will be donated to disaster relief.

<p>There is Talk of Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng Going to Malaya</p>
<p>After the National Games, Chinese tennis players in Shanghai have gradually disappeared. It is learned that national player Xu Chengji, along with Lin Baohua and his wife, left Shanghai a few days ago for Hong Kong and returned south. There is also news that Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng are going to Malaya. A reporter from Guoguang News Agency has made a special investigation of the situation, as follows:</p>
<p>Little Xu Goes to Hong Kong, Baohua Travels Together</p>
<p>National player Xu Chengji, after showing his skills at the National Games, has been living in seclusion at a friend's house on Liangma Road, rarely contacting the outside world. After staying in Shanghai for more than a month, he quietly left for Hong Kong on the Chizhali steamer a few days ago (3rd). Lin Baohua and his wife, who have been living in Shanghai for a long time, decided to travel to Java with Little Xu, considering that Southeast Asia has been promoting tennis in recent years, in order to exchange skills and plan to perform several games there.</p>
<p>Old Qiu and Wenzheng Will Go to Malaya</p>
<p>Veteran player Qiu Feihai has outstanding tennis skills and is a pillar of the Chinese community in Shanghai. Wang Wenzheng is also a promising young player in our country. At the National Games, they were invited by Lin Wangsu of Malaya to perform there. It is learned that Qiu and Wang will go to Malaya with Xie Huiheng and plan to leave in the next few days.

<h3 id="e134">Finance: The Gold Market Has Entered the Right Track <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Major Players Softened Midway After Cutting Long Positions; Silver for India Looked Small, Up Four Cents</p>
<p>Since the gold market turned flat the day before, it has been more peaceful yesterday, and the situation has entered the right track. The silver market rose, and major long positions were liquidated. There was a downward trend midway, but there was no unexpected change due to the efforts of the Bank of Communications and other banks to maintain it. The foreign exchange market gradually tightened after loosening. It is predicted that silver for India will fall, the spot market will become firmer, and short positions will also cover. In the end, it was stable again. In the early morning, overseas silver markets rose in England and were flat in the US. The forward silver price in Monteliri also rose by 1.5% to 2.9%. Foreign exchange was slightly longer. London spot gold shrank by half a penny. People's hearts were more tired. When off-site preparatory trading opened, it immediately dropped to 40 yuan. Major players such as Wing Lei immediately sold, and it fell again to 35-36 yuan. Tai Tak Sing and Fuk Hing Wing took advantage of the low price to pick up the slips, and it rose to 38-39 yuan. The Central Bank's list of rates was announced, and both England and the US were flat. The Customs Gold Unit was also unchanged. The standard gold price listed was slightly lower at 1150 yuan. People's hearts were peaceful, and the market hovered. Although it was slightly stable after the opening, the major long positions, such as Yat Cheong, Fuk Hing Wing, and others, repeatedly cut and sold long positions, so the table was loose. Major Chinese merchants still sold US dollars, and the domestic market also loosened and fell to 34.4 yuan. The Bank of Communications and other banks took advantage of the cheap price to maintain it, and it was easy to pull it up. However, although the sale of domestic goods was made in advance, although it rose, there were many plates, and there were not many transactions in the market. The supply and demand were mediocre. At this time, the market was quite idle, lacking special changes, hovering around 38 yuan for a long time. The banks' appetite was still strong, and the domestic market turned flat, so buyers came to activity and broke through the 40 yuan level. It is predicted that silver for India will shrink by six annas, and the spot market suddenly rose, and those with floating positions came to cover, so it gradually rose back to 49 yuan. At noon, the trend was stable, and there were no major changes in the future. It is generally believed that it will rise and fall greatly around the standard price, and it is also unknown. The market situation for the half day is recorded below.</p>

The spot market turned stable, and Tianjin goods and futures were at parity, and transactions were made. Haste pure gold was calculated at 5 yuan, and a small number were purchased by Ying Fung Hang. After entering, it needed to be increased by 10 yuan, and there were no transactions. The swap market turned peaceful sharply. Since the current silver is owned by the state, the general mentality is happy to collect it. The swap price had already fallen to within 10 yuan yesterday, and there was no more posting from many parties. This is due to the relationship between the closing price and the silver fund.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was peaceful, and it was calculated that Yat Cheong, Fuk Hing Wing, Wing Lei, Ting Hong, Wai Cheung, Hang Hing and others were on the selling side, and Gan Cheung Cheung, Tai Cheung Cheung, Yi Fung Wing, Hang Yu, Tung Tai Cheung, Hing Fat Wing, Yik Sing, Chun Yuan Wing, Shen Fung, Wan Hing and others were on the buying side.

<h3 id="e136">Money Market Sees Relief <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Subsidiary Coins Lack Public Exchange Rate, Prices Remain Inconsistent</p>
<p>Since the government stipulated the legal tender (fabi) a few days ago, the money market initially did not know how to adapt. After Chief Financial Officer Kong Xiangxi provided a detailed explanation, the market sentiment has gradually eased. Therefore, the exchange rate for foreign currency drafts in the morning and afternoon markets showed a marked relaxation, decreasing by two cents compared to the previous day, calculated at eighteen cents. The head commission ("hua tou," or "slippage fee") plus water ("jia shui," an additional fee) also became much more relaxed, only being ten cents. Finally, it even reached "bai hua" (no commission). The problem of head-lining (balancing accounts) has been resolved. However, in terms of dealing with draft tickets, people still chose to do business with reputable and reliable firms, otherwise, they would refuse. Therefore, the transaction volume remained low. Morning market transfers amounted to over 3.5 million, with new transactions of over 400,000. The afternoon market saw transactions of over 600,000, and transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 300,000. As for the inflow and outflow of banknotes, due to the centralization of cash, everything was done with banknotes. Therefore, the amount collected back was only over 700,000, while the amount issued reached over 14.4 million. There were also exchanges of other silver coins and hard currency, which were not included as they were categorized under head commissions or remittance commissions and did not involve banknotes. As for the news about the bank's receiving prices, it was very simple yesterday. Because foreign exchange was all bought and sold by the central government, the inflows and outflows of various firms were all handled by the central government, so there were no inflows or outflows. The foreign banks' payments and receipts of drafts, various goods, remittance guarantees, telegram receipts, and other collections totaled 6.45 million. Due to the lack of cash, there were no inflows or outflows in warehousing. Chinese banks received and cleared drafts of over 3.2 million, and various goods, remittances, tax guarantees, and other collections amounted to 4.56 million. Japanese banks received and cleared drafts of over 2.2 million, various other collections of over 2.5 million, remittance transfers of only over 200,000, and telegraphic transfers of 400,000. Money houses received and cleared foreign public documents worth over 53.3 million and foreign head commissions of over 3.45 million, and remittances from various routes of over 300,000. Yesterday, the market announced that after the determination of various currency system allocations, increases or decreases were not allowed. Therefore, there were no quotations in the morning and afternoon markets yesterday, and the previous day's market allocations were followed. Both the Jiangnan and Guangdong subsidiary currencies were priced at 833.30 yuan, but transactions were completely off the books. Currently, the market rule is that 12 small silver dollars or 3,000 copper coins can be exchanged for one legal tender yuan, permanently fixed without fluctuation. Money houses, in such a situation where there is nothing to do and no profit to be made, disregarded everything and arbitrarily raised or lowered exchange rates, with some exchanging 400 cash for every ten cents of a silver dollar, some exchanging 300 cash for every ten cents, and copper coins ranging from 2,800 to 845 cash. Under these circumstances, ordinary residents suffered unnecessary losses. It is hoped that the government will have a solution to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Securities: Bond Prices Still in Turmoil <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>—Results Show a Discrepancy—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was still chaotic. The trend seemed slightly more stable, but the rises and falls were still quite significant. Yesterday, only two sessions were conducted. The morning session was quite chaotic. Near-term troop reduction bonds improved by one jiao (10 cents), while far-term ones improved by nearly one yuan. The 1928 Customs bonds plummeted by four yuan and trading was suspended. After the suspension, the decline gradually slowed. The 1936 bonds rose by one yuan and several jiao. The 1939 bonds also rose by one yuan. The Northern Gang, and Nos. 43 and 48, etc., showed an increasing appetite. In the afternoon session, the news improved, and the upward trend resumed. Except for the 1928 Customs bonds, which were not traded due to the suspension, all other bonds rose, with gains ranging from several jiao to about 2.5 yuan. This month's troop reduction bonds improved by slightly less than four jiao. Considering the market sentiment and the prevailing situation, the upward trend is expected to continue. This is because, based on discount calculations, most prices are still far from the high prices of last year, and the current interest rates are still better than those of other investments. The market results showed some discrepancies, with significant differences between the morning and afternoon. The bonds from the first listed self-compiled bonds to the salt tax bonds fell by several jiao to two or three yuan. Bonds from the Gold Short-term bonds onwards rose by several jiao to two yuan and several jiao. Today's market prices are expected to have at least one adjustment. The total transaction volume was about 40 million yuan. Here is a table comparing the results of the rises and falls:</p>
<p>Session  Lowest Price  Session  Change from Previous Day  Transaction Volume</p>

<p>The yarn market's morning decline and afternoon rise suggests an increasingly moderate situation. This is mainly because most operators suffered losses due to the consecutive days of sharp rises and falls. Although some parties profited greatly, the number of losers outnumbered them several times. The Ministry of Finance's paper currency reform issue, following the government's firm announcement to strictly ban rumor-mongering, has further solidified market confidence, and prices are gradually getting back on track. In the afternoon, due to short covering, the upward trend tightened, and the market rose by 1.57 yuan.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster and Swiss Traders Cover Shorts</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, the market was calm, with consistent declines across all months, creating a very stable situation. This stability was mainly due to the heavy losses suffered by most operators during the recent violent fluctuations. The long-debated currency system issue has been officially announced, clarifying the facts and reducing market speculation. Due to the lack of trading, prices have been stable, and speculative sentiment has gradually cooled down, resulting in a very calm market. As a result, all months fell by 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, or 1.2 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous day. At the opening in the afternoon, the market slightly firmed up. Due to slightly higher closing prices in the bond market, and the short covering by Swiss traders, the market became dry again, and prices gradually rose. However, the momentum was not as strong as before. As a result, all months rose by 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, or 1.7 yuan compared to the morning closing prices. However, large amounts from Tongji and certain other parties have not yet been fully released. It was found that Dafu sold 1,300 bales, Tongji 2,050 bales, Renfeng 700 bales, Dachangcheng 1,850 bales, Changji 800 bales, Minghua 500 bales, Yuan Yi 450 bales, and Dafeng 450 bales. Gengfeng bought 2,050 bales, Jinchang 850 bales, Swiss 2,400 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Changfeng 800 bales, and Run Kang 1,350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Bonded Yarn  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Change  Inventory</p>
<p>November  194.8  192.5  194.8  Up 0.60  27,150</p>

<p>Total 208,300</p>
<p>Over 1,000 bales sold</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,132 bales throughout the day. Prices varied. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 100 Shantou 5 Ningbo 9 Xiamen 10 Jiujiang 5</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Inland 195 Tianjin 2 Wuhu 20 Peers 95</p>
<p>Hankou 10 Jiangxi 45 Changsha 300 Guangdong 25</p>
<p>Cotton Market Facing Short Supply of Negotiable Instruments</p>
<p>The cotton market remains firm. Certain parties still expect higher prices. Tongji is exclusively absorbing, with an estimated inventory of 70,000 dans. As a result, the market faces a shortage of negotiable instruments. The yarn and cotton market situation is relatively expensive compared to the cotton market. In the afternoon, Dafu, on behalf of a Nantong spot cotton merchant, sold around 14,200 dans on speculation. It is said that the standard price is about 8 jiao higher than the current spot cotton price.</p>
<p>Zheng Speculation Improves By Half a Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the bonded cotton market, each month was showing a downward trend, and trading in the market decreased. Local authorities strictly cracked down on rumors, making the market more stable, and rumors subsided. The bonded premium first became stable and then turned downward in the second or third round of auction. As a result, near months rose by one jiao to one and a half jiao, while far months fell by one jiao to two and a half jiao. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere tightened. It is said that the closing price of the bonded premium was firm after a fall and recovery. The buying interest was also strong, but the market was not fierce. Some cotton merchants speculated this month, but Tongji's large amount of absorption still did not release. As a result, each month rose by four jiao to six jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 14,200 dans, Meiji 6,300 dans, Tongji 2,000 dans, Tongxing 1,300 dans, Yuan Yi 5,500 dans, Xincheng 1,700 tans, Yuanxingchang 1,900 twist, Yikang 1,100 twist, Tongfu bought 1,800 dans, Yudai 1,600 dans, Daji 2,600 dans, Gengfeng 8,200 dans, Swiss 1,500 dans, Run Kang 2,500 dans, Changhe 4,200 dans, Tongji 4,800 dans, Tonghe 3,000 dans, Xincheng 2,300 dans, Yichang 1,600 dans. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with quiet market conditions due to the upcoming holiday. Prices fell slightly due to cotton farmers' speculation and bullish profit-taking, with no frost damage reported, and down by one pound tone. Subsequently, prices rebounded as forecasts indicated frost in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas tonight. Peers, Liverpool, and Japanese firms all bought in unison, absorbing all the speculative sales. Inquiries for spot goods were very good, but transactions were difficult due to high floor prices. Near the close, speculation increased, and prices weakened again. As a result, spot goods were unchanged, and futures rose by two pound tones to fall five pound tones. British cotton spot goods fell by two points, futures fell by four points. Indian cotton trading was scarce, and fluctuations were small. Generally, Pingguoer was unchanged, Omlara near month was unchanged, far month fell 0.25 Robi, Bailuoxi was unchanged.

<p>The flour market has already seen a sharp decline, as the prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada have continued to fall by about two or three corners. With the announcement of the currency system, most people feel more stable. The fact that banknotes are designated as legal tender means that domestic transactions are little different from usual. As a result, speculative buying is not as prevalent as it was last week, and profits are gradually being taken out, causing market sentiment to weaken. However, due to the continuing demand from buyers, the recent month only fell by one corner, while the far months fell by three, four, or five corners. When the afternoon session opened, both near and far months fell again. The near month fell further as news spread that spot flour in Tianjin had fallen by six or seven cents, while the far month fell further as many holders sold off. It is expected that if exchange rates become stable and deals are made for imported foreign wheat, the extreme highs will not be seen again. Yesterday's closing prices, compared to the previous day's highest prices, fell by six or seven cents for the near month, and by about one jiao for the far month.</p>

<p>Wheat prices at the opening of the morning session showed a sharp drop across all months. As the gold price loosened, the frenzy surrounding the currency issue gradually subsided. Speculators prefer to seize on rumors and stir up the market. Now that banknotes are still in use and business can be conducted as usual, their goals have been achieved, and they lack opportunities for exploitation. As a result, floating long positions were sold off, and the market immediately loosened significantly. This month's price fell directly from 9 jiao and 3 cents to 8 jiao and 4 cents. Distant month also started stable and then fell. When the afternoon session opened, trading turned clear and bidding became more stable, but the closing prices were still a substantial jiao lower than the previous day's. Spot wheat was not being actively traded due to customer quotations. It is heard that factories are only willing to do business when the prices for high-quality wheat are around 8 jiao.</p>

<p>— (Xu Haowu)</p>
<p>Whether it's suicide, premature death, or a natural end: it's a heartfelt sorrow for flesh and blood, a wail over the coffin; or it's the removal of a thorn in one's side, allowing one to personally attend the funeral, feigning grief with joy, showing the deceased's intolerance and one's own greatness; or it's hiring "specialists" to "dutifully wear mourning," wailing loudly: the entire funeral hall is always filled with cries of anguish.</p>
<p>Death is always symbolized by the tears of bitterness, melancholy, and grief, uniformly painted with a desolate and tragic color.</p>
<p>In reality, no living thing can escape death. It is unnecessary to seek death when one is not destined to die; when one's time has come, as long as one's personality and career have had daily achievements, fulfilling the Creator's painstaking intention in giving body and mind, what is there to mourn in death, what is the bitterness of death?</p>
<p>A corpse lying still has its own silent, deeply meaningful charm. The masses, without serious introspection from this perspective, merely follow customs, wailing and being at a loss. Although there is the saying "the fox mourns the rabbit's death"; cold observation inevitably misses the bigger picture.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Greatest Invention <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>If you were to ask several people what they consider the greatest invention from ancient times to the present, most would answer things like the steam engine, generator, or telegraph. But these are merely the results of earlier and more important inventions. The earliest and greatest human invention from ancient times to the present is the hammer.</p>
<p>Without a hammer, you cannot begin any small construction work. Although you may not directly use it in practice, the tools you use to work must be made with it. The hammer is the first tool that increased people's strength; it is difficult to accomplish anything with bare hands. The hammer was probably invented by an ancestor who was gifted with a divine power to use a stone to crack open the shell of an oyster or a whelk. The earliest hammers had no handle. It was just a stone, shaped for easy holding in the palm.</p>
<p>Attaching such a stone to a handle gives you a more effective tool. Chipping away one side of the stone that is frequently used to form a sharp edge transforms it into a stone axe. The creation of the cutting edge of the earliest flint tools relied entirely on a hammer. Such hammers gave rise to the earliest cutting tools, the axe and hand axe. From the hand axe and chisel to the saw is only one step. The drill is just a prototype chisel. It is the first thing with a round handle, rotated by the palm; later, primitive people invented the bow and made rope wrapped around the bow. Drills with bows and ropes are still used in some crafts today.</p>
<p>With a set of tools including hammers, axes, saws, and chisels, people can make huge logs into small pieces or long strips, and manufacture wheels or other circular objects. Every tool he made, and everything made with his tools, allowed his strength to control all other stronger forces in nature. Now there are several huge machines that can be started, stopped, accelerated, or decelerated with just the touch of a finger, and we can see the continuing effect of the combination of hammers, axes, saws, and chisels. So no matter what great, ingenious, and important things we might imagine will be invented, in the final analysis, we must give credit to the first person who used a stone to crack open an oyster.</p>

<p>Since the rise of neon lights, slightly established stores have willingly undergone this modern baptism in order to decorate their storefronts. It is said that several large square characters can cost more than a thousand gold pieces. The store's consumption is taken from the customers, the wool comes from the sheep, which is understandable. What is most incomprehensible is the land deity's, that is, the west side of the New Shanghai Company on Nanjing Road (next to the old Shuanglong Tea Shop). Who spent a large sum of money to install a long neon light (about fifteen feet long and two feet wide), the electric current in the glass tube reflecting the six large characters "Namo Amitabha Buddha." Once dusk falls, the electric light shines directly, illuminating the city night, dazzling passersby. Someone estimated that such a grand decoration probably cost more than a thousand gold pieces. In the future, it will cost at least hundreds of dollars in electricity bills each month. Who is the anonymous great benefactor who secretly planted this virtuous deed? He sees that the world's morals are not what they used to be, and people's hearts are stealing day by day, so he specially erected this Buddha seat. He put on a set of modern clothes for him, and the electric light shot out can be regarded as the Buddha's light. Buddha's light shines everywhere, the earth is full of spring, and all the violent qi is transformed into auspiciousness and harmony. All the sins of the world are completely eliminated. Thus, his old man's goal is fully achieved. What does it matter if he spends a few dollars? However, this modern "neon" slogan, although relying on the boundless power of the Buddha and its own great radiance, can it ultimately penetrate Uncle Bao's heart? That is still a question—what is the meaning of this dense and bright light for life? Who can crack this mystery of mystery? Setting a new standard and creating an unprecedented spectacle, it stands tall in the metropolis of Shanghai, and at the center of Nanjing Road where it strikes the eye. This humorous Buddha light refuses to succumb and vanish. Is this mystery strange or not? It cannot be named, it is just mysterious!</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This situation was originally very common, because Prince Qing was the leader of the Grand Council, so he was often the first to report matters; but on this day, we saw the look on his face was really a bit different, although it cannot be said how different, it was just in our eyes, the same as when Li Yunying entered the palace earlier to report the flowering of the jade.</p>
<p>The Old Buddha naturally saw it very clearly, and her lips suddenly turned greyish-white.</p>
<p>She knew that the expected disaster had really come!</p>
<p>"What do you have to say?" she asked urgently, her tone very unnatural; although the other officials were all standing on both sides, the Empress Dowager seemed not to see them, staring at Prince Qing with all her attention, without turning her eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>"Returning to the Empress Dowager! This servant has just received some news," Prince Qing still revealed his usual demeanor of a high official, and reported in a low voice.</p>
<p>"What news? You should have reported it earlier!" The Empress Dowager was really very anxious, and couldn't help but say her own thoughts directly: "This morning, we had expected that there must be some bad news coming, and now you have indeed brought it!"</p>
<p>Although Prince Qing heard the Empress Dowager say this, and knew that the news he was about to report was indeed bad news, how could he deliberately deceive? So he plucked up his courage and replied:</p>
<p>"Japan has declared war on Russia!" (452)</p>

<p>Now, anyone with a little geographical knowledge knows that going from Nanjing to Jingzhou requires passing through the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei. Even going to Jiujiang, how much of a journey is that? During the Three Kingdoms period, there were probably no unobstructed highways! How is it that in the play of Liu Bei returning to Jingzhou, starting from Nanjing, he escaped Zhou Yu's garrison at Chisang Pass in just one day? Even if we consider that he was riding a steed that could travel a thousand miles a day, and that he had the ability to leap over streams, so that even places where the water was cut off would not hinder his galloping, yet Madam Sun was clearly sitting in a carriage pulled by manpower, could it be that there was also divine help in secret? I think that although place names may have changed from ancient times to the present, the land itself would not shrink, would it?</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 21: Gently, She Showed Maternal Affection in the Courtyard, and Angrily, She Reproached Her Son-in-Law with a Lion's Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>Fortunately, my father had gone to the army, and he was still in our fort, so I could see him every day, and I wasn't too sad at first. One morning, the army suddenly left, taking my father with them. Everyone in the fort was overjoyed, feeling a burden lifted, but only my family cried our hearts out. From then on, we didn't get any news of my father. Later, after two years, a villager from a nearby village, who had been in the same camp as my father, escaped home and told us that my father had died in battle half a year ago. The three women in my family suffered and struggled through these years. When we thought about the future, and that there would be no day of relief, we disregarded our lives and came to Xi'an. Unexpectedly, when we got to Xi'an, I ended up like this. As she spoke, she began to shed tears. Old Mrs. Zhu said: On the way here, I heard people say that when you get to Xi'an, you've reached paradise, and you don't have to worry about anything. When we got here, we saw that paradise is indeed paradise, but it's paradise for the rich, not paradise for the poor. Inside Little Western Paradise, everything is good, but for us poor people, looking at the back door, we can't even get in. Mrs. Zhou laughed: You see this place as paradise, but some people see it as hell. But if I say this to you, you wouldn't believe it. Mrs. Jia, you've lived in Little Western Paradise for a few days now, do you think this is paradise or hell? (356)</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3 id="e157">Footprints on the Lake <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Mengjiao</p>
<p>A Night at Nanping</p>
<p>Three days after the Double Ninth Festival in the year Yihai, I had business in Wulin and hurried back to the lake. In the evening, I drove my car to Jingci Temple, where the monks Ruopiao and Wanyuan came out to greet me upon hearing the sound. After tea, we set up wine and sat in the Jingye Courtyard, drinking heartily. There were many playful words in the conversation. Laughter often reached outside the door. There was no meat in the temple, so I brought out the dried meat and smoked fish slices that I had brought with me to accompany the wine, which tasted very good. I remembered that I had stayed in temples three times in my life, namely Wannian Temple, Zhongfang Guang Temple, and Tiantong Temple, and this was the fourth, but I was much happier here. At that time, all the monks were asleep, and I heard no human voices. The cool moon peeked through the window, and the severe frost was on the ground. I heard autumn insects chirping on all four walls like rain, and I felt as if I was in a dream.</p>
<p>Foggy Lake</p>
<p>At dawn, I heard the bell of Nanping Temple ringing slowly, so I put on my clothes and went out of the temple, and went boating on the lake with Master Fen, Meng Qi, and Ruopiao. The morning fog was thick, misty like a curtain. Looking into the distance, the twin peaks of Ge Ling had disappeared, but the Six Bridges and Two Pools sometimes appeared and disappeared. The lake surface was covered by water vapor, floating and illusionary, and uncertainly hidden and revealed. Leaving Baiyun Nunnery, the fog became heavier, and my clothes felt damp. Looking around, the boat seemed to be floating in the vast sea, so I asked the boatman to put down the oars and sing wildly, no longer knowing what world I was in. I then said to the fellow travelers: "Today's tour is really far from the mundane world, so why bother to take a raft?" Everyone was very happy. After a while, the fog stopped, the sun came out, and the light was bright and warm, so we returned from Xiaoyingzhou, drumming our oars. People say that the scenery of West Lake, a sunny lake is not as good as a rainy lake, but I say that a rainy lake is not as good as a foggy lake. A rainy lake is wonderful, but a foggy lake is even more wonderful.</p>
<p>Exploring Osmanthus in Manjuelong</p>
<p>Osmanthus is distinguished by color, with gold osmanthus and silver osmanthus. By time, there is early osmanthus and late osmanthus. In the past, the osmanthus markets of West Lake were mostly in Lingyin and Three Tianzhu, and the New Southern Book records: "There are many osmanthus trees in Lingyin Mountain in Hangzhou, and the monks call them moon osmanthus. Often one falls on the Mid-Autumn Festival night." Also, the Group of Fragrant Plants says: "Mountain osmanthus is most abundant in Tianzhu, and the monks call it moon osmanthus, and its flowers are often continuous, with a few spots vaguely on the branches and under the leaves, which is also a different species." Now, Manjuelong is the most prosperous, with all kinds of osmanthus, and you can count the flowers in autumn. When the flowers bloom, the sea is golden and the waves are silver, and the fragrance covers several miles. People come from all directions to explore, shoulder to shoulder. The residents often place tables and chairs under the trees for the viewers to sit and rest, and the income they receive each season is quite large. When the autumn colors are at their peak, I take two or three poet friends to explore the osmanthus. I hired a rickshaw from Jingci Temple, six miles, to the foot of Wengjia Mountain. The slopes gradually became higher, and the rickshaw swayed and could not go up, so I took off my leather shoes, put on monk shoes, and walked with a staff. When I arrived at Manjuelong, the late osmanthus had already withered. Tables and chairs were scattered among the trees, silver petals were strewn everywhere, and the remaining fragrance still lingered on my clothes. I called for a palanquin carrier around noon, passed Shuile Cave, and listened to the clear sound of the spring, with a natural rhythm, and finally felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Dragon Well</p>
<p>After the revolution, West Lake has also changed its state several times. The embankment is getting wider day by day, and the lake surface is getting narrower day by day. Who knows if it will not become farmland in the future? This is something to worry about for Xizi. Recently, many wealthy merchants like to occupy a seat in West Lake to be honored, with buildings lined up and more houses than mountains. Those who claim to be elegant are actually tarnishing the lake and mountains. I say that today's tourists to West Lake, what they see are only foreign buildings and foreign consulates, and what they hear are the sounds of cars and machines, with all kinds of noises, and the quiet state is lost. Is it still possible to seek the past, when one could ride a donkey and wander among the smoke and willows of Banqiao? All my fellow travelers had the same feeling, so we decided to seek a place deep in the mountains and rivers, which would only be Fengyu Ridge, Jiuxi, and Lian'an. It was decided. Traveling east from Santai Mountain, the noise gradually disappeared, and my mood was refreshed. Passing Ling Shi Mountain, I looked at the mountains surrounded by the inside, the towering cliffs and deep ravines. Doves cooed in the empty mountains, and floating clouds gathered from all directions, with the intention of rain. Entering Fengyu Ridge, the yellow leaves beside the road rustled, and the green bamboo swayed, all with a desolate and clear feeling. Reaching the Two Old Men Pavilion, the rain came. The smoke and clouds over the lake were swirling, and the scenery was incredibly beautiful. Looking back at Hugong Ridge, the setting sun and the Wu Palace were all submerged in the fog. I wanted to cross Yanhua Ridge and visit Jiuxi Lian'an, but was prevented by the rain. So I huddled with Shi Zishu Fan and Prince Tie Hua on the pavilion. Listening quietly to the boiling tea in the pine tripod, my heart was relaxed and content, as if I had gained something. After noon, the weather cleared, and I returned from Maojiabu to visit Yue's Tomb. I ascended to the Qingyuan Wine House for a little drink, savoring the pleasure of this tour, and unknowingly got drunk.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Treatment of Gonorrhea <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yuan Yimin</p>
<p>To discuss the treatment methods for gonorrhea, it's necessary to briefly explain what kind of disease it is and its condition. Only then can we understand which methods are reasonable and which are not. The first time you get gonorrhea, it is mostly acute anterior urethral gonorrhea, with very few exceptions. Anterior urethral gonorrhea refers to the fact that gonorrhea bacteria only attack and multiply in the anterior part of the urethra. Logically, local symptoms only require local treatment, and drugs to kill gonorrhea bacteria are readily available everywhere. Why do Chinese and foreign doctors consider it a difficult disease to treat? Because the gonorrhea bacteria are lurking in the inner layer of the urethral mucosa. If you want to completely kill the gonorrhea bacteria without damaging the mucosa at all, it is difficult under such narrow circumstances. However, if you can apply it skillfully, you can recover completely. There are many methods for treating gonorrhea, including electrotherapy, washing, injection, and internal medicine. Electrotherapy uses hyperthermia, which is divided into long-wave and short-wave. Long-wave therapy must be applied close to the body, which is not only troublesome but also has many disadvantages, with the risk of burning the skin and little effect. In recent times, the most popular method is short-wave diathermy, which can be treated through clothing and is effective quickly. Using the light power of electrical equipment to kill bacteria, the best one is the latest turbidimeter. The light power of this machine can penetrate deep into the skin without any damage. Washing and injecting involves injecting a sterilizing liquid into the urethra. The distribution of the washing liquid according to the condition, the concentration used, and the time are all related. Nowadays, the injection of gonorrhea serum is more appreciated. The best preparation of this kind is "Gono-Serol." Injection is giving a shot. Yellow pigment and mixed gonorrhea vaccine have a certain status in treatment. Yellow pigment can penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, and mixed gonorrhea bacteria can make the body produce antibacterial bodies, thereby achieving the purpose of eliminating bacteria. Among these preparations, the better ones include Antiseptine Trypaflavine. Internal medicine focuses on strong pain relief, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal power, with those that can disinfect the urinary tract and penetrate deep into the mucosa being superior. It is important to avoid those that contain strong astringent ingredients. The current sterilization drug used by doctors is quite suitable and is an excellent preparation. Although the treatment of gonorrhea is as mentioned above, diseases change in myriad ways and cannot be generalized. Moreover, the treatment of gonorrhea, even with a slight difference, can leave endless harm, such as prolonging the recovery period and developing into chronic diseases. These are all the results of wrong methods and random medication. The Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city, is presided over by Mr. Feng Shanliang, a famous doctor at sea. The hospital's treatment of gonorrhea, the novelty of the methods, and the skill of the methods can be said to be second to none. Other equipment such as electrical equipment is complete, and it has reached the pinnacle of gonorrhea treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Only with Determination Can One Talk About Quitting Smoking <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Lutang</p>
<p>The harm of opium is known to everyone. However, because it has the effect of treating the symptoms of all kinds of diseases, such as relieving pain, suppressing coughs, and stopping diarrhea, people often use opium to treat diseases at the beginning of their illness, and many become addicted as a result. After becoming addicted, they hesitate to quit, fearing the danger of death. Although the current government strictly orders smokers to register and quit, but thinking carefully about the psychology of those who quit, most of them are forced to do so because the environment does not allow it. How many people are there who are willing to quit on their own initiative? A doctor helping people quit smoking is like treating people for illnesses. The patient must safely accept the doctor's treatment method in order to achieve a good result. Otherwise, if they seek medical treatment on one hand and deliberate on their own on the other, how can they expect to achieve the goal of quitting? Even if it is possible to quit, it is certain that they will smoke again. The reason why smokers fear quitting is only because they fear that their body will be affected and cause illness. However, they do not know that with the experienced doctor applying the quitting method, measuring the body and applying the quitting method, and combining regulation and supplementation, good results have always been obtained in the past. Moreover, today, the methods of quitting smoking are even more advanced. My friend Mr. Yu Lei, currently practicing at Chunsheng Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, has unique insights into internal medicine. There are dozens of fellow smokers who go to him to quit every day. There are more than a thousand people who have escaped the sea of smoke through his skillful hands. It is said that his smoking cessation method is very economical. Whether it is blister injection, serum, egg yolk protein, or oral medication, the price is not counted, and a daily fee of two yuan is charged.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Discussion on Ringworm Medicine <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. He Tianlu</p>
<p>Skin diseases are common and easily transmitted, especially ringworm. Hairdressing, bathing, and other things that directly touch the skin can easily cause transmission if you are not careful. However, most people treat these ringworm diseases casually, because they are minor ailments that do not matter much. Only when the symptoms worsen do they pay attention to them. However, it is quite difficult to find a reasonably effective remedy. The medicinal agent suitable for skin diseases must have the following conditions to be considered top grade: (1) Strong bactericidal power without any damage to the skin; (2) Not harming internal organs due to skin absorption; (3) Fragrant odor, not staining clothes. Having these three conditions can be said to be excellent. Is it only the "Sterilization Extinguisher" sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy? After my clinical trial, all cases of scabies, stubborn scabies, wet scabies, itchy rashes, etc., have received miraculous effects immediately after using it. I am using a few words to inform the world of those who suffer from ringworm and skin diseases. (Editor's note: Ren Shou Western Pharmacy is located at No. 1, Lao Dexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, this city. Its Sterilization Extinguisher is sold for one yuan per box.)</p>
<h3 id="e161">Harm of Phimosis <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>Phimosis easily causes diseases, such as the accumulation of dirt, which can cause swelling and ulcers. If infected with venereal disease, the pain will be even more severe and the healing time will be longer. Other conditions such as penile cancer and paraphimosis can be said to be harmful to human health. Also, because the foreskin is too tight to be turned up, it not only causes sexual discomfort, but also because the semen is not directly ejaculated, it also hinders fertility. For your own happiness and health, those suffering from phimosis should have it removed as soon as possible. (Editor's note: Dr. Cui is skilled in surgery and has experienced foreskin surgery. There is absolutely no pain during the circumcision, and you can work as usual after the circumcision. His clinic is located in Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, and the anesthetic surgery fee is only ten yuan.)</p>
<h3 id="e162">Advice to Those Suffering from Gonorrhea <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Everyone knows that gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat. This is because once gonorrhea bacteria invade the human body, they are deeply hidden between the epithelial cells of the mucous membrane, and the structure of the bacteria is diplococcal, making it difficult for drugs to penetrate deeply and kill them. There are many ways to treat gonorrhea, including local washing with medicinal liquids, injection of mixed gonorrhea vaccines and pigments, and oral administration of diuretic and bactericidal agents, which can be said to be the best possible treatment. However, there are often gonorrhea bacteria that still exist. At this time, it is necessary to conduct a detailed examination, otherwise, even if it is temporarily in a static state, when there is a suitable opportunity, it will reappear its inflammatory effect. Over the months and years, it recurs from time to time, and the patient often feels disappointed. However, today, with the advancement of science, there is the invention of short-wave diathermy in the treatment method. Even in terms of oral medicine, the newly invented gonorrhea treatment medicine "Mesaltropin" is truly a formidable enemy of gonorrhea bacteria. This medicine not only has a strong bactericidal effect, but also has the functions of relieving inflammation, relieving pain, controlling decay, and diuresis. I have repeatedly used it, and it has always achieved complete cure. At the same time, the combination of electrotherapy and injection has an even better effect. Because "Mesaltropin" has the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, regardless of whether the bacteria are encapsulated or deeply hidden in the mucous membrane, the medicine can penetrate the membrane layer deeply and directly act on the bacteria and kill them. This is something that ordinary gonorrhea treatment drugs cannot match. There are many people in the country who suffer from gonorrhea, so I am writing this article to explain the functions and effects of the famous medicine. (Editor's note: Mesaltropin is only one yuan per box and is sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Lao Dexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession.)</p>
<h3 id="e163">Treatment for Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a common symptom among neurasthenia patients. However, for unmarried men, occasional nocturnal emissions once or twice a month are a normal physiological phenomenon and should not be considered a disease. Nor should it be presented with the terror often implied in medicine advertisements. At most, it can only be said to be an inducement of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The causes of this condition include personal fatigue. In such cases, one should avoid overworking the body and mind and consume plenty of nourishing foods to nourish the whole body. For those who develop this condition despite good nutrition and vigorous blood circulation, they should choose bland, less stimulating foods. Furthermore, they must maintain proper thoughts and eliminate lustful desires. Other factors, such as masturbation and excessive sexual activity, can also cause this condition.</p>
<p>Medications often used include bromine compounds. Some claim that the hypnotic drug "Attering" has miraculous effects. However, my clinical experience has shown that "Aolsen" tablets can often achieve unexpectedly rapid results. It is truly a leader among therapeutic agents for this condition, unparalleled. As for electrical therapy, shortwave diathermy is the best choice. When applying it, place the anode on the upper part of the lumbar spine and the cathode on the corresponding position of the abdomen, delivering an appropriate current for about ten minutes. Other methods, such as hydrotherapy, have only minimal effects. There are frequent discrepancies in results even when the same treatment is applied to the same conditions. (Editor's Note: Dr. Feng has unique insights into neurasthenia and is praised as an expert. The "Aolsen" medication he often recommends is sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Lao De Xing Li, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, priced at only $1.50 per box.)</p>
<h3 id="e164">Causes and Treatment of Stomach Pain <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Jiang Guofan</p>
<p>Acute gastrectasia, chronic gastritis, hyperacidity, gastric juice leakage, and sudden emotional disturbances can all cause stomach pain. When considering internal medications for these symptoms, alkali agents are the most reliable. This is because they can neutralize stomach acid, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, stop vomiting, and regulate gastric function to ensure normal movement. Such preparations are harmless even with regular consumption. Unlike painkillers containing anesthetic components, "Wei Bao", sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Lao De Xing Li, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, is a refined combination of alkali agents. It is remarkably effective for all stomach ailments, such as nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and bloating. I have repeatedly used it in my clinical practice and recommend it to those suffering from these conditions based on my proven experience. (One Citizen’s Note: Wei Bao is the best among alkali agents, standing out like a crane among chickens in the general stomach medicine market, so its effectiveness is indeed certain. Each box is priced at only two dollars.)</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Our publication has invited over ten expert physicians to create this column. Readers can submit questions about diseases, and we will provide detailed answers. Letters should briefly describe the condition, treatment history, etc., and be sent to Shanghai Post Office Box 1668, c/o this publication. If you prefer a written response rather than publication in the journal, please include return postage of 2 cents for local inquiries and 5 cents for out-of-town inquiries.</p>
<p>To Mr. Li Jiao:</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a symptom of sexual neurasthenia. You can purchase "Arolsen", priced at $1.50 per box. It is sold at Wing On, Sincere, Wuzhou, Nanyang pharmacies on Nanjing Road, Sino-Western Pharmacy on Si Ma Road, and Huacheng Pharmacy on Lao Ximen Heping Road.</p>
<p>Most Effective Treatment for Ringworm</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Xu Yingzhi) I have suffered from ringworm for many years. Because it is located in the concealed area of my buttocks and sometimes does not itch at all, it has gradually spread. Now the affected area has expanded, and it itches intensely at night. I want to purchase a medication, but I am afraid of being deceived by medicine advertisements. I would be grateful for your guidance.</p>
<p>Answer: You can purchase "Mi lizne" to treat it. This medicine does not harm internal organs but has a strong, penetrating bactericidal power. It has a fragrant odor and does not stain clothing. Each box is priced at only one dollar. It is sold at Nanyang, Wuzhou, Sino-Western, Huacheng, and other major pharmacies in this city.</p>
<p>Can it be Taken Regularly?</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Zhao Naishan) I previously suffered from stomach pain and was cured by taking Wei Bao sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Lao De Xing Li, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, as recommended by your publication. However, I am afraid of a relapse and would like to know if it can be taken regularly.</p>
<p>Answer: Wei Bao does not contain any anesthetic components. Prolonged use is harmless. It can also be taken for indigestion because it can regulate the peristalsis of the stomach.</p>
<p>Turbid Urine</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Chen Fangying) I previously suffered from leucorrhea and was cured by taking herbal medicine. Now the purulent discharge has gradually stopped, but my urine is turbid. Please recommend a good medicine.</p>
<p>Answer: You can purchase "Mesaltropin" for internal use and "Gono-Serol" for external use. This should gradually heal you, as this is a sign that the gonorrhea has not been completely cured.</p>

<h3 id="e167">The Weather is Fine, the Sun is Out <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>When I was little, I went to variety shows and enjoyed listening to Shanghai opera. I was most fond of the clowns who would interject comical remarks. Especially when they sat in the center, solemnly shaking their broken fans and starting with the opening line: "Ah han! The weather is fine, the sun is out! The rain wets the steps." At the time, I didn't understand the ways of the world, or things like humor, but looking at those "serious-looking" funny faces, I found it quite interesting. However, thinking about it now, I find it almost pitiful.</p>
<p>The reason why clowns are so popular in plays is first and foremost because they are considerate and don't offend anyone. Whether it's the superiors or inferiors, left or right, big or small, when they make a funny face for you and add a "Yes, sir! How do you do?", it's much more welcome than a lengthy speech of "righteous opinion." Secondly, clowns' speech also requires some skill. This "skill" doesn't mean they say anything profound, but rather that they talk and talk, and in the end, it's as if they said nothing at all. In a society full of traps, this kind of skill is necessary. Modern people don't find it easy to speak. And "eat more, talk less" is an ancient Chinese saying. However, humans are truly strange creatures; it's not easy to keep one's mouth shut and say nothing, but as soon as one opens one's mouth, the crisis of "trouble comes from the mouth" follows you. As a last resort, thinking from a small perspective and considering the grand cause of "universal peace," some people have come out to advocate "talking about foxes and ghosts, discussing flies," etc. But even though foxes and ghosts are vague, and flies are tiny, in the end, there's still something there. If you greet people with "The weather is good today" like in the old days, that's even more inappropriate. First, this statement has too much critical coloring; you might say the weather is good because you got paid, while I insist on saying the weather is bad because you wouldn't understand my state of mind. That is to say, maybe it's because I was just turned down for a loan. Subjective criticism is unacceptable, and objective criticism is "please don't speak your mind," so in addition to "talking about foxes and ghosts, discussing flies," there's the clownish "the weather is fine, the sun is out, the rain wets the steps," a way of speaking.</p>
<p>It is said that the past year was a "year of humor," and what kind of year this year is is uncertain, but judging by the situation, the life philosophy of "the weather is fine, the sun is out" is probably still not outdated, and the clown's act is not yet disliked by people. Then, this year might be the "year of the clown" when the clown is in the spotlight.</p>
<p>After all, the world has reached the end of the night, and it really should be "the weather is fine, the sun is out."</p>

<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>I stopped in front of a small door near the city wall. I tapped on the newly painted black gate, and someone inside responded. At the same time, a woman's head appeared at the small window next to the door. I told her my name. After a short while, the sound of leather shoes hitting the stone slabs echoed, and I knew that Dong was coming out. Because that footstep was very familiar to me. When the door opened with a creak, his forever-smiling face was once again in front of me.</p>
<p>His study was a small room. Although it was just five o'clock in the afternoon, darkness had already enveloped it. After he let me sit on a chair without a back, I couldn't say the few words I had prepared. What was wrong? He didn't show any sign of rejecting my conversation, and he wouldn't dislike my conversation either. But I couldn't say it.</p>
<p>——How's life? Long time no see.</p>
<p>I said that after a long period of deliberation. I don't know how many times I've said these kinds of things. It always starts like this every time we meet. The reason is that I'm often whipped so painfully by life that I can't even lift my head. For others, I think the same - a person living in this era is full of depression everywhere! He still replied to me like a smiling Buddha:</p>
<p>——It's okay, it's okay!</p>
<p>He handed me a glass of plain water. I drank it, surveying the layout of the room. It was still clean, but the walls had lost their vitality due to age. On this old wall, there was a central hanging scroll and two couplets.</p>
<p>His eyes followed mine, surveying the scene.</p>
<p>My actions were like those of a stranger who had just arrived. Did he doubt me? He asked me how life was. My answer took a long time to come out, and it was the words I had prepared. I truthfully told him about my suffering in life, as well as other things. The most important thing was that I wanted to borrow some money from him.</p>
<p>It was very clear that he didn't have money either; but, he still had a home. As for me, I didn't have a home, no friends, no, I had one, and that was Dong.</p>
<p>He put away his forever-smiling face, and replaced it with an enthusiastic expression seized by deep affection. He extended the hand that always holds people tightly, to me, expressing sincere apology.</p>
<p>——You should know me, there's no way my family can provide me with money (lowering his voice to say:) Father only knows how to smoke opium, Mother only knows how to save money. There's no way I can get any money. It's really…</p>
<p>His two hands rubbed together, as if he was too apologetic.</p>
<p>Then, we shifted to other topics.</p>
<p>Probably his father had returned. The sound of conversation from the house across the way could often be heard, along with the scent of opium.</p>
<p>As I was about to leave, I happened to run into him walking toward this house. I followed him back to where we had been originally. This was his idea, he wanted to say a few words with me. While we were talking, his hand held a shiny white copper water pipe, taking puffs with a creaking sound. First, he asked me about Dong's affairs at school, and also asked about mine, before uttering his opinion:</p>
<p>——I still don't approve of this Western school. Don't look at how fashionable his mother is… Look at what Dong has become, even getting married (author's note: marriage) he objects to!… Objections? If he objects, I won't let him go to school, and we'll see about paying tuition after the summer vacation!</p>
<p>"Suddenly," he blew away a pile of ash.</p>
<p>Dong stood blankly by the bed, his legs leaning against the edge of the bed. His eyes were constantly staring at the ceiling or the damp ground. He also looked at me as if many worries were piled on him. As for me, I was like a co-judge, feeling amused and sad. His father walked out without expressing anything to anyone. I comforted him and walked out of that black lacquer door with an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Comforting myself, how grateful I am to not have the burden of a family or relatives, but where should I go? My stomach is hungry, my clothes are torn, how will I maintain my life tomorrow or today?</p>
<h3 id="e169">Sedan Chairs and Rickshaws <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Small Chronicle of a Village Trip</p>
<p>The train pulled into Waiyangqi. I looked out the window towards the station. Outside the wooden fence, on both sides of the road, the former black, dovecote-like sedan chairs had been completely replaced by rickshaws. No, it would be more accurate to say they had been replaced by rickshaws.</p>
<p>In the past, sedan chairs were the only means of transportation in my hometown. Sedan chair businesses did not stop anywhere like streetcars; they had fixed storefronts, like rickshaw stations in Japan. Moreover, the cost of a sedan chair was quite high, unaffordable for the average person, more than ten times higher than in places like Hangzhou where mountain sedan chairs cost one or two yuan per day. In my hometown's county town, which was only three li across, the cost was no less than one yuan. Therefore, the sedan chair business was very bleak. However, visiting guests, attending banquets, especially year-end gratitude ceremonies and New Year's greetings at mansions were always done in sedan chairs to enhance appearances. As long as a sedan chair business had a few contracted mansions, they had nothing to fear.</p>
<p>As for the organization of sedan chair businesses: some were run by the owner, who provided several sedan chairs and hired sedan chair carriers, paying them a fixed monthly salary. Very few operated on a profit-sharing basis. Others were owned by a few people who provided the sedan chairs; they were all bosses and shared the business equally. The latter was more profitable because expenses were lower and they took the business seriously. Although they didn't have guild rules, the boundaries were very clear. If a certain sedan chair business or group of people had a business arrangement with a certain mansion, they would never try to snatch it unless there were special circumstances. When going to a sedan chair business to hire a sedan chair, as long as you recognized the servant who worked at a certain mansion, even if the sedan chair carrier who usually did business with that family wasn't at the shop, his companions would find a way to call them. The reason they didn't interfere with each other was naturally because the income was good. The sedan chair carriers would spend their time chatting and playing cards in teahouses near the sedan chair business. In the second and third months of the year, after the New Year's business was done, the sedan chair carriers would gamble quite a bit of money.</p>
<p>Few mansions had their own sedan chairs. Those who did had either served as minor officials or had considerable status. The former wanted to put on airs, and the sedan chair was often inherited from the past. As long as they regularly hired two sedan chair carriers at home, who also had兼職，呼喝過市的時候總覺較轎行里叫來的威嚇，—這近乎上海洋車和包車的　別。後者必是鄉紳之類，他們公事多，進出忙，自備籘轎旣便利，開消又省。這兩種籘轎，在街上路人大都認得出是某家的。第三種輪到太夫了，（故鄉從前是沒有醫生的）他們不但自備籘轎，轎夫更由兩名而增至三名。普通籘轎以安步當車為漂亮，坐轎的人撫着轎前的　手板，身體微微向前，頭部探出在轎門之外，遇到熟人，互相招呼，態度是莊嚴而自然。　夫的籘轎就不　，一個轎夫在前面開道，嘴里高聲吆喝着，招呼　人讓路，後面兩名轎夫就健步　　　追隨着，那大夫坐在轎里就　得十分得意了。他們的意思是看病如救火，要愈快愈好；至於用三名轎夫，那表示這大夫的出診忙，兩名轎夫恐怕沒有休息的時候，就　備一名作為預備軍了。寫到這裏，我記起一個笑話，而且是實事，故鄉的父老輩大都能夠詳詳細細講述的。在若干年前，一位大夫掛牌之後，沒有生意，他就異想天開發明了坐籘轎的廣告術，他每天坐了籘轎，大街小巷亂跑，以示他的忙於診務。但是故鄉地面小，他的籘轎祗見滿街飛，却不見在人家門前停歇，他的西洋鏡終於穿拆了。</p>
<p>自從三年前故鄉的建設局拆平橋樑，修築馬路之後，不知怎樣一來，通行洋車了。洋車通行之後，自然轎行都受了打擊，紛紛倒閉。起初由人包辦洋車一百輛，劃定了多少站頭，大有求過於供的樣子。拉車子的人就是由哪些轎夫改行的，他們雖然覺得沒有做轎夫時的舒服，進欵却增加。因為籘轎是要二人分拆的，洋車就獨自進益，定價比籘轎賤，坐的人就多，車租是論月的，自然比之上海論日的要便宜許多。這樣，一般農忙過後的莊稼人，及每日徘徊於茶館的小販，都想來搶吃這碗飯了。利之所在，人皆爭之，包辦洋車的亦分頭鑚營，於是××洋車行××洋車行都開起來，車輛由一百二百而五百，現在馬路兩旁的兩列洋車，像金蒼蠅似的不知有多少輛了。</p>
<p>火車駛進站，車廂是吐出寥寥的幾個乘客，但是走到木柵收票處，團團的被車夫圍上了：叫着，喊着，你幾乎懷疑在什麽碼頭上岸，一不留意，或許你的行李已被人搶去了，不過這是搶生意，祗要必去坐上他的車，什麽都不會短少的。如果有兩隻手搶着你的行李時，那就得費一番周折了，因為他們有的是功夫，能夠許久堅持着不放手，你這個行李的主人就祗有站着等他們分勝負。</p>
<h3 id="e170">Red Smartweed <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>When mentioning flowers of autumn, everyone will think of chrysanthemums. But I think that the loveliness of chrysanthemums is far inferior to that of red smartweed.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are indeed lovely in some ways. For example, chrysanthemums do not bloom in the spring when all flowers are competing for beauty, nor in the summer when it is easy to survive, but bloom when frost and snow are about to impose their power on all things. This point is indeed a commendable advantage of chrysanthemums. In addition, the posture, color, and fragrance of chrysanthemums are enough to give people a pleasant mood and have been cherished.</p>
<p>However, the loveliness of red smartweed is no less than that of chrysanthemums. Although she does not have the gorgeous flowers of chrysanthemums, and she does not have the dazzling colors of chrysanthemums, her graceful and charming posture, and her red and white, slender and exquisite flowers can also bring joy.</p>
<p>Not only that, red smartweed has another value that is more precious than chrysanthemums. When we see chrysanthemums, we seem to see a modern urban girl cultivated in rouge and powder, while red smartweed is like a healthy and beautiful girl living in the countryside. The former will pretend to be charming, forcing people to love them; the latter can use her innate nature, truthfully and genuinely, to move people naturally. Forced love is false, and natural emotion is pure.</p>
<p>Although red smartweed has this kind of loveliness, it is ignored. She is not cultivated in delicate flower pots, nor is she worshiped on elegant tables. No beauty wears her in her hair, and no one holds appreciation meetings for her. People have only apathetic attitudes toward her. Therefore, she can only hide in the corners of ponds and riversides, accompanying the lonely geese that have lost their flocks, and sobbing with the autumn wind.</p>
<p>However, this may be the luck of red smartweed, that she can maintain her natural nature in the natural world. Even if this is not her luck, it is not worth our pity. Isn't everything in the world like this? The false and pretentious are supported by people, while the genuine and natural are buried among the grass and trees.</p>

<p>Outside the ten li pavilion, the water is surging, O my love! Farewell! Farewell! Inside the ten li pavilion, eight cups of wine, the future is boundless, the sea is wide and the mountains are far away. Don't worry, don't worry, you are young, always ambitious and talented! O!

<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Night of the Tang Palace"</p>
<p>The moon wheel is high before the Hall of Eternal Life. Red candles burn incense in the ninth heaven. A full plate of fruits is offered in the courtyard. Jade flutes play Phoenix Xiao in unison. Look at a bay of new moon water. Autumn is so wonderfully clever. The autumn wind brushes the face, and excitement is doubled. Looking back at the Milky Way filling the magpie bridge. The heavenly maiden smiles faintly, waving her hand to the Cowherd across the river. Although the Double Seventh Festival happens every year, we chat about it once a year. Yang Guifei kneels on a brocade futon, slowly adding fragrant droplets. Under the double moon, first, I wish the country will always be united, and the smoke of war will be extinguished to avoid gunfire. Second, I wish the emperor good health, and a life as long as Mount Tai. Third, I wish the concubine Yang to always be by the Western Palace, enjoying the emperor's favor. Morning and evening, I attend the emperor, never separating in life and sharing the same path in death. Only then did the concubine express her heartfelt intentions.</p>

<p>Manchu Opening</p>
<p>The north wind howls, rolling up yellow sand. North of the border are all Manchu families. Running horses and shooting arrows are the heroes. (There is) a second young lady born with the beauty of a flower. (Born with) a melon-seed face like a hibiscus. A hibiscus face (born with) willow-leaf eyebrows and bright autumn eyes. A powder-white nose like jade. A small cherry mouth. Glutinous rice silver teeth. A large ring flower is inserted high beside her ear. Wearing a black gauze hood. (Also) a bright pearl radiating light. Wearing a long cheongsam. (Wearing) a 'da la la' style of embroidered shoes. A 'da la la' style of embroidered shoes. Embroidered with flower patterns all over the vamp. The young lady is alone and bored. To pass the time, she plays the pipa. First, she plays a song of Xiangfei's Grievance. Then, she caresses the lonely wild goose landing on the sandy shore. Then, she plays a song of General's Order. General's Order. (Only) Zhong Ziqi can meet Yu Boya. The young lady is playing the pipa. Playing the pipa. (Suddenly) a handsome trouble-maker arrives. The trouble-maker is only seventeen or eighteen years old. Snow-white face. (Without) a single pockmark. Wearing a long arrow-sleeved coat and a short jacket. Wearing a melon-skin cap. Hanging a tobacco pouch on his waist. His left hand is holding a small child. His right hand is leading a piebald mule. The young lady immediately stands up. Calling out, "Brother, please sit down." (Waiting for) little sister to send you a cup of milk tea. (That trouble-maker) seeing that the great king is not at home. Says, "Let's play together." The two of them fall drunkenly on Yang Guifei's couch… An old mama runs in from outside. Eighty-eight years old. Head full of white hair. Holding a dragon-head cane. Says, "You two young rascals. What are you doing here in broad daylight? The old king. Is coming back. He's going to. Cut off your heads." Laughing. Haha, hee hee, haha. The young lady reaches out and slaps her hard across the mouth. Cursing, "Old rascal. Is coming back. I'm not afraid of him. Killing a head. A bowl-sized scar." Saying. "Wu li bi. Wu li ya. Wu li men deng bei'er cha. Zhi cha ya. Zhi ya cha. Wu li zhi ge da. Ge da bei'er ya." Speaking foreign words. Speaking barbarian talk. We Chinese. How would we understand him?</p>

<p>Haozi Wu Cun's "Spring Flower" was originally played by "Old Lead" (Wu Cun's plays are mostly starred by Gao Qianping, hence the name "Old Lead"). Now, because Xiao Gao has torn up his contract with the Star Company, the female lead will be played by "A Zai" Wang Naishuang.</p>
<p>The monster Shen Xiling's "Family Woman" was sent to Beijing for inspection. It is said that it has not yet passed. The content will probably be revised in one or two places, and the lyrics of the song "Today, Ah Today" sung by Hu Jia will also be changed.</p>
<p>It is heard that in the fifth act of "The Government Inspector," the letter that "is not without benefit to the world and the hearts of the people" was originally changed into Japanese by the director Guo, but as a result, Gu Menghu dropped it. Therefore, this performance can only come up with a "classical Chinese" version.</p>
<p>After the first night performance of "The Government Inspector," Zhou Boxun teased Wang Ying, saying, "Miss Wang, someone said that you are ××ing too much in the third act!"</p>
<p>"You pig!"</p>
<p>"Really! If you don't believe me, ask Shi Dongshan. Dongshan also heard it."</p>

<h3 id="e181">THE BIRTH OF THE DIESEL BUS <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Cummins High-Speed ​​Diesel Engine Company's attempt to manufacture a diesel engine bus has recently been successful. Therefore, the honor of creating the first production record belongs to the company and its director, Cummins. According to this bus, it is made by using the Auburn eight-cylinder chassis. Except for the diesel engine. Everything else remains the same. That is, the installation location of the engine. There is no slightest change. As for the price of the product and its sales plan. Nothing has been heard so far.</p>
<p>Fuel saving. On the day the news was released, Mr. Cummins personally drove his first product. Drive straight from New York to the Pacific coast. Make an economic journey. It is expected that the fuel required for this trip. Should not exceed eight US dollars. The heavy oil used by the engine. It is very convenient to purchase. Because villagers use oil-fired machines. It's all there is. Oil prices vary by region. From 3 cents to 1 dime US dollars per gallon. The average price is about 6 cents US dollars. However, there are places where national taxes must be added. Its selling price will be higher than this. Ordinary users. Each gallon can travel 40 to 50 miles. The degree of fuel consumption. Depends on the speed.</p>
<p>The speed increases sharply. Mr. Cummins's faith in the diesel bus. It hasn't changed for years. Now that the effort has been successful, the bus manufacturing industry has gained a new field. Is it only Mr. Cummins's proposition that can be implemented. The history of Cummins Company manufacturing diesel engines. It dates back to 1919. The initial products. Only for stationary and marine diesel engines. Later, diesel engines for trucks, buses and rail vehicles. They were released one after another. Today, let's take the diesel engine for trucks as an example. Those used by people. The number reaches more than 1,000 units.</p>
<p>In March 1930. Mr. Cummins installed a Cummins marine diesel engine on a four-cylinder Packard car in Daytona. Created a speed of 80.398 miles per hour. Created the first official record for diesel engines. Attracted the attention of the world. In 1931, he returned to Daytona. Created a new record of 100.75 miles per hour. By the beginning of this year. Biel Cummins broke all records in Daytona. And created the highest diesel speed of 137.199 miles per hour. Those who participated in the Indianapolis car race. In 1931, there was Mr. Evans. At a speed of 86.170 miles per hour. Ranked thirteenth. In 1924, the late Mr. Sott Steburfel also reached the peak. At a speed of 88.566 miles per hour. Ranked twelfth. The cars used by these two people. All are equipped with Cummins diesel engines.</p>
<p>Not very flexible. This time Mr. Cummins made a trip across the United States. The reporter accompanied the end seat. It is also driving the section of road within the boundary of Virginia. From Lexington to White Sulphur Springs. Measuring 72 miles long. It was found that this high-pressure engine is not as flexible as a gasoline engine. Even its power is smaller. Although the direct transmission of the high gear ratio is changed to a ratio of 4.000 to 1. The centrifugal transmission is changed to a ratio of 2.65 to 1. Still cannot compete with the power of Auburn. Standard tooth rate. The former is 4.30. The latter is 3.20. The maximum speed of the car. Not enough time to calculate. However, it is more than enough to travel 65 miles per hour. Standing behind the car. You can often smell a gas. In the car. The slightest feeling is not felt.</p>
<p>The engine is a six-cylinder overhead valve type. Has a long push rod to raise and lower the valve and piston pin. Its bore and stroke are 3.75 and 5 inches. The piston displacement is 331 cubic inches. It is said to produce 85 horsepower. Its speed is 2,200 revolutions per minute. The original engine used by Auburn. Its horsepower is also 85 horsepower. But its speed is 3,500 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p>Weight reduction. Diesel engines are considered heavy. But the total weight of the Cummins Diesel engine. Only 860 pounds. Only 80 pounds heavier than the gasoline engine of the Auburn eight-cylinder car. The reason for its lightness. There are about two points. Once the design is meticulous. One is the change in the cylinder head and cylinder head. Aluminum alloy is the one. The movable cylinder is connected. Then it is made of cast iron. If the cast iron outside the speed limiter and injector can be changed to aluminum alloy. Then it can reduce the weight by 20 to 30 pounds again.</p>
<p>We hope that the weight of the diesel engine can be reduced to the same as that of the gasoline engine. It is not impossible to achieve this goal. However, it is important to know that. Although its speed is lower. But its piston displacement is even larger than Auburn's 279,9 cubic inches. It is 331,4 cubic inches. Therefore, the reason why Cummins's total vehicle weight is 250 pounds heavier than the original Auburn car. Because it needs to be equipped with a large starter. Batteries. And generators are the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>Requires a powerful starter. This diesel engine has a compression force of 500 pounds. Therefore, a powerful starter is required. Therefore, its batteries and engine. I also had to use a heavy one. The entire mechanism is operated with 12 volts. The generator is 225 watts. Several times larger than those used in other buses. The piston is made of aluminum alloy.</p>
<p>Another message. According to news released in Indianapolis. The first batch of buses equipped with diesel engines in the United States. Can be sold in a few months. This vehicle. Produced by Court Automobile Company. It is a diesel engine manufactured by Columbus City Cummins Machine Company and installed on an Auburn car body. As to whether it is still enough to promote abroad. Still not known. The provinces where diesel engines are used are well recognized. But at present, whether this engine can be applied to buses. Then the language is different. Each insists on a national language. Initially, I didn’t expect the Court Company to actually start proceeding in the midst of disputes. However, according to the recent opinions of Mr. Sloan, Vice President of General Motors. It is said that the engine is currently unusable in passenger cars.</p>
<h3 id="e182">ZHEBEI AUTOMOBILE TRAVELOGUE (LOWER) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>On Sunday morning at 8:45, I departed from Hangzhou, planning to cross the Qiantang River, four miles away from Hangzhou, but soon encountered the third obstacle, because it was reported that the bridge across the river had been interrupted. This kind of news was surprising to me, because I had inquired from the China Travel Service and the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau this morning whether this route could be used or not. I returned to Hangzhou and left the Wulinmen Station at 10:00 a.m. The speedometer was 5.255 miles. With Tianmu Mountain as the destination, I departed from the station and proceeded along the avenue passing through Changhua to Huizhou. After traveling 30 miles, I saw an ancient stone bridge spanning the clear stream. The scenery was very good and worth a visit. After following the stream in the shade of old trees, I set off for Lin'an at 11:30 a.m. The mileage record of the speedometer was 5,288 miles. At 12:15 p.m., I saw a fork in the mountain road in front of me. From Wulinmen Station to here, the journey was 48 miles. I turned the rudder to the right and entered the branch road for 12 miles, passing through a mountain path with excellent scenery, and arrived at a station. Travelers can abandon the car and walk about half a mile to reach the Tianmao Hotel at the foot of the mountain. Its location is in the valley at the foot of Tianmu Mountain, which is very quiet. This hotel is being renamed Tianmu Mountain Hotel. The equipment inside is very modern. It is not very far from Shanghai. For those who like the quiet of mountain living, the melodious sound of clear springs, and mountaineering, this place is really the best place to rest. The hotel also offers a 10% discount to all members of the Chinese Automobile Club.</p>
<p>I encountered the first rain of this trip in the mountains. The misty veil shrouded the mountain scenery. Otherwise, the mountain is more than 4,000 feet high, and looking up and down, there is enough to please the eye. The characteristic of Tianmu Mountain, in addition to fir trees and strange trees, is also full of bamboo groves, which is quite different from the mountains seen along the way. After climbing for two hours from the foot of the mountain, I reached the temple on the top of the mountain. The scenery along the way is worth a visit. Those who are not physically strong can hire a mountain sedan to travel, which is very comfortable.</p>
<p>My initial travel destination was to reach Huangshan via the Qiantang River, and then to Yandang Mountain via Wenzhou. Unfortunately, due to obstacles in the middle, I could not follow the original plan, so I stayed at Tianqieshan for another day and a half. On Wednesday morning at 10:45 a.m., I left the bus station near Tianmu Mountain and arrived in the suburbs of Hangzhou at an average speed of 27 miles per hour. The record on the speedometer was 5,367 miles. The Wulinmen bus station arrived at 12:30 p.m. The mileage was 5.373 miles. When using the 50th gallon of gasoline, I left Hangzhou for Shanghai, a journey of 133 miles. Except for a 40-minute break in the middle, I arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 p.m. Those who want to travel by car in Zhejiang Province should pay attention to the fact that when this article was written, the Qianjiang Nandu Bridge across the Qiantang River in southern Zhejiang was interrupted and cars could not pass. The road south of Yuxi was also washed away by the water, and the road from western Zhejiang to Anhui was also impassable due to collapse. The location is 17 miles from the other end of Chun'an.</p>
