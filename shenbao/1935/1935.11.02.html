<p>此次事變突然發生揣測紛紜。莫衷一是所幸兇手三人均已就逮。窮治研訉之下不難得其眞相。在內慕未經剖明以前吾人雅不願輕事論列。唯有一點不能不深致惋歎者。誠以狙擊行爲非可隨地而施。當茲國難嚴重之日。端賴各方精誠團結。六中全會集領袖人物於一堂以共謀奠國之大計。事前接洽匪易人民屬望正殷。而倐來此意外一擊。危及最高行政長官以增進國是之糾紛。而輕貽外人以口實則暴徒此舉。無論爲出於個人之逞私讐報。爲挾有背景之借軀行兇。要爲冒天下之不韙。宜難邀時論之寬恕至大會諸公。對茲倉卒事變。極應臨以鎭靜態度。一方追究行兇之責任。一方賡續大會之進行使議案討論。不致頓挫全國人心免於動搖。以徐俟汪院長傷勢之康復。吾人於非常激刺之餘。亦唯以此平凡貢獻。期當局之垂聽耳。</p>

<p>— 中國社會教育社兪慶棠主編　兪慶棠</p>
<p>中國農村問題的嚴重，農人生活的艱苦，到現在可說達到極點了。誰不驚心於歷年的水旱災荒蕩盡了多少人民的生命財產；最近黃水之災，魯西三十餘萬被災者，蕩析離居，蘇北百餘萬災民，飄流待斃？誰不知道災荒時固然顆粒無收，就是豐年也因外來的農產品的傾銷，使自己農產品的價格跌到本錢都不够？又誰沒有聽到耕地的日漸减少，貧農佃農的急劇增加，農村手工業的破壞，民族新工業的不振，使得健全的農人有着勞力而無處使用？三萬萬以上貧苦無告的農民，就在世界經濟的威脅和舊有生產關係的桎梏之下，偷度着非人的，被壓迫的生活！</p>
<p>怎樣應付世界經濟制度的威脅，而可以不受他的打擊，怎樣改造舊有的生產關係，而從他的桎梏解放出來，使農民能先蘇息一下，再自由地發展他們的生產力，而度着合理的社會生活？這就是目前的農村問題的眞際。</p>
<p>本欄的旨趣在：（一）供給各省各地農村的現實狀况，描寫農村民衆的眞正疾苦；（二）剖視外國經濟力量在農村中的作用和影響；（三）分析和比較最新的農村經濟統計材料，顯示農村凋敝的實在情形：（四）介紹農民對於自己生活上苦樂和對於現狀的意見；（五）介紹國內外對於改進農村生活之理論以及已有顯着成效之實騐事業，這些材料，如其能够引起我們大家的警惕，思考，考證，研求，使得農村問題，能够有一個合理的解决，則這小小的一欄，也盡了它的能盡的任務了。</p>
<p>本欄所載的槁伴特別注意下列幾項標準：第一，內容有創作性，篇幅不很長，却是民間生活的透視和寫眞，不是不加思考的任何現存材料。第二，文字富有興趣，生動活潑。第三，寫實須有時效性，如對最近發生的災荒兵焚等在農村的襲擊情形，竭力介紹，以引起大家救濟的熱情和努力。第四，材料在代表的地域上，要力求普徧，而不限於任何一隅一地的範圍。</p>
<p>我們誠懇的以這欄貢獻於讀者之前，希望我們廣大的讀者，特別是住在各地農村裏的和從事實際鄉村工作的讀者，能够經常地供給我們珍貴的材料。輿論的逐漸造成；客觀的材料的逐漸積聚：農村問題的眞際的逐漸顯明；從事實際的披露，到問題的討論和解决：這都要靠全國人的集體的力量，而是我們深切期待的。</p>
<h3 id="c37">對於地租問題的一點意見 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 柏良</p>
<p>近年來中國農村動亂不已，原因固然很多，而地租問題確是一個重大的原因。所以要想安定農村，除了取消土地私有制度，根本廢除地租外，至少對於地租問題都得要想一個妥善的辦法，然後才能見效。否則，雖茍安於時，終難免長久的動亂。作者不敏，願借「農村生活」的園地來貢獻一點對於農地租率的意見，供大家的參考。</p>
<p>中國農地地租之高，無論物租錢租，均極明顯；如物租常佔產量百分之五十以上，錢租也常佔地價百分之十以上。因此，中國的「購買年」之短，為各國所不及。所以有人說：中國的地租，不單是地租，並且包含着一部分的農業紅利，甚至一部分的工資。因為地租過高，佃農苦不能負擔，所以年來有减租運動，如十五年國民黨提出的「二五减租辦法，便是一例。這種辦法，是不問原租額的多寡，一律减去百分之二十五，所以呌做「二五减租一。但自從這種减租辦法提出後，除浙江省曾一度實行外，其餘各地均未切實施行；即使間有施行的，也只是徒引糾紛，以致變為有名無實的减租運動，或擾亂農村的减相運動。細究其原因，除地主反對减租，政府不切實執行法令外，「二五减租」本身也有問題。第一，「二五减租」的涵義不明，有人解為從農作物正產的全收穫量先减去百分之二五，以償佃戶所塡的資本（副產全歸佃戶），餘剩的百分之七五，由業主佃戶平分，即各得百分之三七·五。換句話說，業主得百分之三七·五，佃戶得百分之六二·五。這是從生產物總額减去二五的意思。又有人解為先將收穫量平分，即業佃各半，再由佃戶繳與業主的租額中减去百分之二五。如此，則業主所得僅百分之二五，而佃戶可得百分之七五。這是所謂照租約减去百分之二五或約定租額减去百分之二五。「二五减租」既有兩種不同的解釋，如業主所得原在百分之五〇以上者，必贊成第一種解釋，採用前法减租，而佃戶則贊成第二種解釋，採用後法减租。反過來說，如業主所得原在百分之五〇以下者，則贊成第二種解釋，採用後法减租，而佃戶勢必贊成第一種解釋，採用前法减租。因為解釋不同，業佃間發生很多糾紛，結果，「二五减租」更艱實行。第二，縱使「二五减租」沒有解釋的糾紛，業佃間不發生爭執，而照一二五减租」的辦法施行，對於業佃兩方也不免因田地的等級不同，收穫量各異，發生不公平的現象。譬如淅江各縣依照二五减租實施標準以百分之三七·五為租額）實行後，佃農與業主所得，仍未能勻稱，便是一例：</p>
<p>每畝全收穫量　佃農所得　除去生產成本　佃農凈得　業主所得　除去所納賦稅　業主凈得</p>
<p>三石　一八·七五元　六·〇〇元　一二·七五元　一一·一五元　　一·〇〇元　一〇·二五元</p>
<p>二石五斗　·五·六　六·〇〇　九·六三　九·三七　一·〇〇　八·　七</p>
<p>二石　一　·五〇　六·〇〇　六·五〇　七·五〇　一·〇〇　六·五〇</p>
<p>一石五斗　九·三八　六·〇〇　　三八　五·六二　一·〇〇　四·六二</p>
<p>一石　六·　五　六·〇〇　〇·一五　　·七五　一·〇〇　二·七五</p>
<p>五斗　三·一三　六·〇〇　　二·八七　一·八七　一·〇〇　〇·八七</p>
<p>由上表，可見實行「二五减租」後，每畝收石以上者，佃農净得，比較業主略多；在二者石穫二石者，業佃兩方净得兩相等；如收穫在二以下者，佃業净得，遠不及業主，甚至要賠本。這是很明顯的表示不公平的現象，也就是爭執不能實行的一大原因。</p>
<p>「二五减租」既多窒碍難行的地方，於是由「二五减租」的蜕變，又有規定最高租額的辦法，以謀保護佃農；如浙江省修正二五减租暫行辦法第二條：「自本辦法公布後，凡新成立之租佃契約，其繳租額應以該田地常年正產物全收穫百分之三七·五為標準，其副產物應全歸佃農所有。」便是一例。後來國民政府公布的土地法第一七七條規定：「地租不得超過耕地正產物收穫總額千分之三百七十五，約定地租超過千分之三百七十五者，應减為千分之三百七十五，不及千分之三百七十五者，依其約定。」也大致相同，即限制最高租額的意思。這種規定，雖可以補救「二五减租」的缺點（如一律從原租額中减去百分之二五，則原租額多的仍然是多，少的未免太少，標不公平），但是也有不妥當的地方。因為地租有差額地租（Ricardo）和絕對地租（Marx）的不同：前者以土地生產力的差異為其發生的原因，地租當然不會相等的；後者由土地私有權而產生，在土地私有制度之下，地租是沒有差別的。土地法的立法用意旣在保護佃農，則其規定最高租額不得超過千分之三百七十五，只能保護耕種肥沃田地的富裕佃農；而耕種磽瘠田地的貧困佃農往往得不到法令保護的實惠。因為中國地租的高低，未必依照土地的肥痟，事實上往往上等　地的租率較下等田地的租率為低。如照土地法施行，肥沃田地减租多，磽瘠田地减租少。而貧困的佃農，依據近來調查的事實，則多耕種確痟的田地。所以土地法規定的法益，仍未能公平的享受。</p>
<p>還有一層，如果土地法的規定是在减免由土地私有權而來的榨取，則耕種　疥田地的貧困佃農更應受保護，更應减租。因為耕種　瘠田地的，絕少發生差額地租的餘地，其所繳納的地租，幾全為血汗的結果，在土地私有制下，縱不能絕對廢除，至少也要减到最小的限度，方為公允。而照土地法的規定，則對於這點沒有什麽作用的，難怪為一般學者所不滿。</p>
<p>此外土地法規定最高租額不得超過千分之三百七十五，有時也足以阻碍土地生產力的發展。因為租額既不能超過千分之三百七十五，則地主方面自不願意多投資本去改良土地，而仙農方面又限於資力，結果，土地生產力當不免受着限制。</p>
<p>根據以上簡單的叙述，「二五减租」旣多窒碍難行，而土地法的規定又多為學者所不滿，那麽，在中國目前土地私有制度之下，究應如何規定適當的租率呢？作者認為宜採「二五减租一和土地法的長處，先由地政機關或其他機關將田地分為三等（或三等以上），然後按照各等田地，分別規定最高租額，佃農即依照各等田地的租率而交納地租，地主不得收取超過各等田地租率的地租。此後如地主願意投資改良土地，田地等級改變，租率也可以依次提高。反過來，田地因不可抗力而减低生產力的，佃農也可以向地政機關或其他機關申請降低田地的等級，减少租率。譬如：</p>
<p>上等田地之最高租額，不得超過正產物收穫總額千分之三百七十五；不及此數者，依其約定。</p>
<p>中等田地之最高租額，不得超過正產物牧穫總額千分之三百五十；不及此數者，依其約定。</p>
<p>下等田地之最高租額，不得超過正產物牧獲總額千分之三百；不及此數者，依其約定。</p>
<p>假如田地的等級分別越多，最高租額也隨之細分。照這種規定，有最高和額可以防免地主的苛收地租，而最高租額又是差等的，是按照土地生產力之差異來定的，對於各種佃農，對於各神土地生產力，均能兼顧，比較土地法規定，妥當得多；在今日地租高度過當，佃農困苦萬分的時候，實值得改良農村生活的朋友們注意一下。</p>

<p>貿易數値　從貿易數值觀察、自一九三二年以來、我國對外貿易發生劇烈的下减、一九三二年對外貿易、總值數較一九三一年减退百分之四、一九三三年較一九三二年减退百分之九、一九三四年又較一九三三年减退白分之三、迄至本年上期、我國對外貿易、雖未能一反以前的减落而為增加的現象、可是本年下落的程度，都稍見緩和、計本年上期我國對外貿易、總值為八零四·八二四·九六八元、與一九三四年同期比較僅减少百分之四、若就出入口貿易分析、則本年上期出口貿易額計二五九·三六九·六七三元、較去年同期减少百分之三四二、入口貿易額計五四五·四五五·二九五元、較去年同期减少百分之四六、本年上期、我國輸入貿易價值的减退、一部份為輸入物價减退的原故、一部份則為輸入物量减少的結果、</p>
<p>貿易平衡　本年上期、我國入超額、共計二八六·零八五·六二二元、較去年同期减少一千五百二十一萬九千餘元、在我國通貨極端堅縮的時候、入超額减少、未始不可喜、不過我們應注意入超額的减少、並不是由於出口額的增加、而只是為入口額的减退率高於出口額的减退率的結果、本年十期、入超額占入口總依百分比仍為五二·四五、與去年同期之五二·八七、並無二致、金銀貨流動與貿易平衡有密切關係、本年上期、因政府限制白銀的出口、獎勵百銀輸入之故、白銀一轉出超而為入超、生金及金幣方面、本年也出超、大抵金銀净出超額、約占本年上期我國商品入超額百分之七左右、由此可知本年上期我國硬貨不過抵補商品入超很小的一部份、大部商品入超、還須有賴於無形收入、或留待下期設法抵補、</p>
<p>貿易性質　從商品貿易性質觀察、本年上半期我國對外出入口貿易品分配、依性質分別、較去年頗有變動、在出口方面、因為紡織出品的銳减、製成品所占白分比减少、於是原料及半製品一躍而居弟一位、製造品退居第二位、飲食品及烟草仍居第三、入口方面、也有改變、製造品占弟一位、米穀入口激增、故飲食物及烟草類進為第二、原料及半製品則退居第三、若是以本年上期各類商品價值與去年同時期比較、則在出口方面、原料及半製品較去年上期增加百分之十五、飲食物及烟草亦增加百介之四、製造品則减少百分之二三、此外雜貨也减少百分之八以上、在入口方面、以金單位計值、飲食物及烟草增加百分之三四、製造品增加百分之七以上、雜貨增加百分之二五、惟原料及半製品則减少百分之八以上、</p>
<p>進口商品　本年上半期我國洋貨入口總額、以國幣計值、計五四五四·五五千元、較去年同期之五六九·八四九千元、减少百分之四·二八、在各榶入口商品之中、以米殼為額最巨、其次為五金、再次為棉花·木材·煤油·染料·顏料·化學產品·及製藥·砂糖·紙類、亦各值一千萬金單位以上、此外棉布·車輛·汽油·毛織物·柴油·魚介·海產、則各值五百萬金單位至一千萬金單位不等、</p>
<p>出口商品　去年上期我國出口商品、以皮貨為最多、本年則桐油一躍而居第一位、略次為五金礦砂、再次為皮貨、此外皮蛋及蛋產品·茶葉·花生、各值千萬元以上、生絲·棉紗·毛類·抽紗及綉花品·綢緞·及豬鬃各項、則各在五百萬元至千萬元之間、其他重要出口商品、則依次如腸衣·棉花·藥村·香料·牲畜·果實·菜蔬·菸草·煤、均在數百萬元左右、此外有减無增者、為茶葉·藥料·香料·果實·菜蔬·草帽·及草帽鞭·豬鬃·蓆·及蛋·與蛋產品·等、大抵本年上期我國出口商品中、有减退者、實多於有增加者、</p>
<p>貿易國別　本年上期我國　各國貿易的增减、輸出方面、以意大利·德國·澳洲·美國·朝鮮·法國·等增加較巨、荷印·日本·印度·蘇俄·香港·英國·暹羅·安南·等、則都有减退、輸入方面、以對渙洲增加最鉅、其次對暹羅亦增、此外安南·日本·德國·等都有增無减、對美國·香港·英國·荷印·印度·蘇俄·法國·朝鮮·等則反見减少、</p>
<p>貿易埠別　本年上期、我國各埠對外貿易的消長、也是值得注意的、以本年上期與去年同期比較、在出口方面、靑島·汕頭·漢口·南京·蕪湖·燜台·拱北·蒙自·各埠、均有增加、上海·天津·廣州·九龍·厦門·寗波·福州·江門·梧州·及秦皇島等埠、則見减少、入口方面、與去年同期比較、有增無减者、為天津·靑島·汕頭。挑北梧州·漢口·寗波·有减無增者、為上海·廣州·九龍·厦門·福州·江鬥·蒙自·南京·九江·蕪湖·烟台·秦皇島等、</p>
<p>趨勢歸納　綜上所述、我們對於本年上半期我國對外貿易的趨勢、可以歸納為下面幾點、（一）在貿易數値方面、無論出口或入口、本年上期較去年同期均有减落、不過衰落的程度、似已較以前為緩和、又據我們研究的結果、本年出口的衰落、仍是由於出口物量的减退、而出口物量减退的原因、則與年來銀價高漲、滙市放長、有重要的關係、至於入口數值的减落、則為入口物價與入口物量雙方减少的結果、（二）本年上期因為出口减落的程度、尚不及入口衰落之甚、所以入超額較上年同期减少、金銀出超减少、係政府限制白銀出口與獎勵白銀輸入的效果、由此可知本年上期我國以貴金屬抵袖商品入超的趨勢、巳大减少、（三）商品貿易、在入口方而、三項主要餘糧米·麥·及麵粉·本年上期均較去年同期增加、這當然是由於去年災荒的結果、建築材料及生產工其、如機械·木材·五金、也較去年增加、這是年來我國經濟建設事業發展所致、惟棉花則大為减退、此外其他消費品、則或增或減、大致與去年無分軒輊、在出口方面、桐油·五金·礦砂·花生·抽紗·綉花品·煤·腸衣、較去年增加、牲畜·烟草、維持原狀、其餘如棉紗·絲·茶·蛋產品·皮貸·毛類·綢緞·棉花·棉布·豬鬃·等、則均有减退、在貿易國別及埠別方面、雖亦有多少變動、可是大體還是與往年大致相同、</p>

<p>標金晨跌午回</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致下瀉、因連朝飛勝之標金顯着反動回挫之象、人心見弱、且檯面上買者减縮、浮多稍稍了結而疲落、但證券帮又來狂購、為額殊巨、市價賴以維持、二盤回昇數角、三盤謠言突起、被刺消息播來、一時市塲大為震撼、賣風驟濃、市價狂瀉、結果各月比上日收盤價跌三元六角至五元一角、午後開盤忽轉上昇、形勢緊張、謂標金上午最低價曾至一千一百零七元、午後重行跳躍至五十元外、通貨謠說尤盛、通記又來從事收買、市塲籌碼乾燥、市盤愈拍愈挺、結果各月比上午收盤價漲二元七角至三元九角、查賣出明德一千四百五十包、合興一千四百五十包、愼記一千五百五十包、仁豐二千包、潤康二千四百五十包、達記八百五十包、裕大一千一百包、買進裕大一千四百包、錦昌六千九百五十包、賡豐一千一百包、愼昌一千二百五十包、大昌成一千三百包、同和一千一百五十包、大孚二千一百五十包、長豐一千五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>智術兼全藝瑧化境　中西觀衆咸嘆觀止</p>
<p>（廣州特訊）世界職業網球名手柯顯、最近東遊前月杪抵菲律演、本月二日起與菲島弟一流網球選手分日比賽、柯氏七戰七勝、菲島網球　將盡為屈服、菲島舉國無不嘆服、柯氏在菲比賽後、對於菲島網球霸主亞拉剛、雖將其挫敗、然對亞拉剛球藝大為賞識、因約同亞氏及菲網球健將加非斯、預定作澳洲雪梨之遊、一面邀請上海網球職業家卡那凡洛在香港會集、準備出發、柯氏等一行三人、業於廿五日趁麥堅尼總統輪抵香港、旋應廣州市民體育會之約、作表演賽、幷參觀粵省建設、在港休息一日、二十六晚即乘港輪晋省、二十七晨抵廣州、上午遊覽廣州市名勝、及參觀各項建設後、赴市民體育會之歡迎會、是日駐粵各國領事、及僑粵法英德等國僑民、均踴躍赴會、為國際聯歡會中之空前盛會、蓋各國人士久仰柯氏盛名、咸以一覩柯氏丯彩、欣賞其球藝為幸也、</p>
<p>盛况空前　是日下午三時在中央公園市民體育會網球塲比賽、預定比賽三塲、第一塲第二塲為單打、第三塲為雙打、門券分一元、二元、三元三種、午後購券入塲者已魚貫而止、體育會門前車水馬籠、中西仕女肩摩踵接、擠擁不堪、未屆三時、門券早已售罄、後至者在座後站立、至在塲外遠眺者、亦不下千人、</p>
<p>柯氏登塲　三時指正、裁判員登台、先由（菲）亞拉剛與（滬）卡那凡洛作單打對抗，亞拉剛氣力充沛、經騐豐富、藝勝一籌、以六比一壓倒卡那凡洛、第一塲仍係單打賽、法國柯顯於觀衆鼓掌歡呼中出塲、各國記者趨前為柯拍照、氏隆準深目、具一副冷靜頭腦、一望而知為智術兼備之名將、對手為僑粵德人賓狄加、（氏為廣州網球冠軍）亦網球界後起之秀、</p>
<p>世界職業網球家柯顯在廣州表演左即柯氏右德人寶狄加</p>
<p>出神入化　開賽後、枸顯表演出色、屢困寶狄加、其擋球抽球與壓球、均有獨到之處、有時用輕鬆手腕、送球過網、使對方鞭長莫及、有時用迅雷不及掩耳之抽擊、球疾而勁、令對手無從防備、其一操一縱、令人莫測、當緊張之際、對手奔走全塲、招架為難、而柯氏獨以鎭靜出之、屹立如泰山、動則若脫兎、對方雖有險急之球、亦能應付裕如、氏不但以球藝見長、且常窺破對方弱點、乘瑕抵隙、運用球兒、出神入化、蓋「術」「智」兼全老也、對手寶狄加亦非弱者、然遇柯氏、不啻小巫見大巫、在半小時艱苦應戰中、　以六比比三敗於柯顯、</p>
<p>雙打表演　第三場為雙打表演賽、（菲）亞拉剛與（菲）加非斯為一組、而柯顯則與寶狄加合作、共賽三盤、第一盤柯顯發球、着着勝利、以六比二勝、第二盤亞加人年少英勇、抖擻情神、採取攻勢、以六比三勝回一盤、第三盤柯實一組漸形不支、蓋寶狄加於前塲苦戰柯顯之後、己筋疲力竭、再與柯顯合作、氣力益不繼、反之、對方亞加一人賈其餘勇、節節抄擊、是時柯顯屢施其截球絕技、扳回數分、然獨力難支、亞加組遂以六比三、再勝第三盤、雙打總結、比、亞加組卒獲勝　、</p>
<p>離粵赴港　　　已下午六時、暮色四合、觀衆至是始歡呼而散、晚間、市民體育會歡宴柯顯及菲選手、柯等二十八日離粵赴港、二十八日至三十日、每日下午三時、在香港九龍本球會球塲作表演賽、下月初趁英郵船赴澳洲、（十月二十七日晚）</p>

<p>— 吳研因</p>
<p>（十月二十五日對全國中等學校學生講）</p>
<p>（二）從小學教員的本身說小學教員所負的責任、何等重大、據我們的孟老夫子說「逸居而無教、則近於禽獸」、美國教育家桑戴克也說、「假使幼兒絕對不與成人接近、不受成人所施的教育活動的影響、那末二十年後、這一羣幼兒除了大部份因為出天花、生黃癉病、生瘧疾、以及種種瘟疫而死的以外、所剩下的人、不能說話、不知禮義、不會使用器械、他們的生活、一定和猴子相去不遠」、可見教育是必要的、教育是延續人類文明研一種必要的方法、而且因為人類求生存求舒適的緣　、一切布「健行不息」地進步著、教育也就是教人類趨利（大衆的利）避害、日進文明的一種必要方法、不但延續原有的文明、而且「革故鼎新、」會把原有的文明改良促進、生長不已、這是從人類的一般文明說、再就某一個國家的某種特殊環境說、一個國家或民族要求發展或者生存於世界上、也非教育不可的、帝國主義各國、所以能够繁榮、單靠少數資本家的金榮資本是不够的、必得教育她們的多數百姓、自信是「超越的種族、」勝過一切所謂野蠻民族、或是半開化的民族、必得教育百姓、　建造一羅馬帝國」、或是「第三帝國、」或是為「大和魂」為所謂「日本的生命綫、」而拚命作戰、不貶眼地殺人、不猶豫地掠奪殖民地、開闢富源、帝國主義的教育、促成了帝國主義的繁榮、所以德勝法、日勝德、都歸功於小學教員、所以在這不景氣的世界上、各業都幾乎停頓下來、而德國、意國、日本的小學教育、並不因之而停頓、或者反比從前重視些、小學教員待遇方面、所受的影響也很小、反之、半殖民地的國家、如我國和阿比西尼亞、也就是吃了教育不發達的虧、百姓體力不強、知識不够、意志不堅、所以戰不渦帝國主義、所以中日戰爭時、有許多漢奸為日本軍人所利用、所以意大利兵到阿比西尼亞的境內、阿比西尼亞的部落、就有許多投降意軍，在國難嚴重的時期、我們要挽救危亡、復興民族治本的方法、仍非靠藉教育不可、仍非靠藉小學教員負起重大使命來不可、要延續並推進人類的文明、或挽救危亡、復興民族、斷不是隨隨便便、一天到晚做做普通的教書匠的小學教員所能勝任的、小學教員必得有心腸、有膽量、有毅力、有方法、才可以起負重大的使命來、小學教員要有心腸、有胆量、有毅力、有方法、怎麽可以不自修養呢、就是丟了人類國家、單就個人的生命說、小學教員要是隨隨便便地做下云、而不自修養、便會暮氣沈沈、離開現代太遠、而自然落伍、自然倒跑到墳墓裏去、我們看見許多小學教員做了二三十年的教書匠而默默無聞、不但不能「與時俱進」而且甚麽都「硬化」了、甚麼都與時代違迕了、我們也看見許多小學教員、出人頭地、不但吸收了新的一切、而且時時有新的貢獻、在小學教界上傳播、影響於一地方或者一國家的小學教育、這兩種小學教員的分野、便因為一則不進修、一則力努力進修的綠故、固然、在出人頭地的小學教員中、也有「純盜虛聲」的一流人物、但是多數總還是因為修養而得到的實力所致、某君有一個很組略的調查、調查兒童對於小學教員的心的傾向、結果兒童所愛戴的教員總是「學問優良、」「教法良好、」「人咯高尚、」「作事熱心」的人、照這樣的傾向、可知小學教員如果要得到學生們的愛戴、也是非修養不可的、</p>
<p>現在、我要講小學教昌的修養方法了、小學教員的修養方法、可以分幾點說、</p>
<p>（一）思相方面　小學教員應當有一個堅強不移的「信心」、信仰人類的文明、一定是前進的、信仰人們應當為大多數人謀福利、信仰帝國主義和一切危害大多數人的惡勢力、必有總崩潰的一天、世界上的「光明」一定會代替「黑暗」而興起、對於現時的中國、需要造就些怎麽樣的國民、更是十分了解、並且深信國家即使滅亡了、小學教員也能够造出有用的國民來、以圖復興、這樣的信心、怎麼樣修養成功呢、必得一方面多讀有關於世界知識和社會科學的新書、留心國際的形勢、社會的切　面和黑暗面的問題、一方面研究哲學、了解人生的意義、確定自己的「人生觀一、這樣、對於教育才有中心、才不致「盲人騎瞎馬、夜半臨深池」、才能够左右逢源、取材施教一切都有辦法</p>
<p>（二）品性方面　小學教員應當明了自己的個性、如果覺得自己太急燥了、一定要鍜鍊出忍耐的工夫來、如果覺得自己太遲緩了、一定要練習做事的敏速而經濟、在兒童反對自己的時候、要研究原因、悉心應付、不可和兒童鬧脾氣、聽見了兒童對自己有不恭敬的話、不可看得太嚴重、擺「師嚴出道尊」的架子來、在忙的時候、不可疏忽、更不可容易衝動而生氣、在疲倦的時候、不可怕煩而心焦而憎惡兒童、在生病的時候、也要抑制自己的脾氣這時銀鍊忍耐的方汰、多預備、以免臨時的急遽、勤練習、以增進自己的工作效率、這是練習敏速的方法、小學教員需要的品性、例如「誠懇」「問情心」、「公平的判斷力」、「應變的能力」等等、在各種教育書裏、說得很詳細、至於養成這些品性的方法、不單是讀教育書所可成功的、必得常常自巳經歷、自已反省、檢查自巳的缺點筆記下來、或者聽取別人的批評、努力地改惡遷善、多讀些教育家的傳記、也是修養品性的有效的辦法、</p>
<p>（三）身體方面小學教員的工作極忙、任負極重、當然應當保持著健康的身體、保健方法、做小學教員的個個都知道、用不著別人多說、但是大家往往玩忽懈怠、不去實行、我以為方法要是太繁瑣了、自然不容易實行、如要實行、必須取簡單易行而有效的方法、常常做去、我想、要是選定一種自己歡喜的運動、常常去做、於自已的身體、一定有益的、在全校兒童早操的時候、教員如果加入早操、於教員的身體方面也很有影響、至於節制飲食戒絕烟酒、種種消極的方法、如果有志　行的話、也一定可以做到、</p>
<p>（四）知識方面小學教員的知識、應當有兩方面、一方面是自己的基本知識、一方向是教學時應用的知識、增進知識的方法、一面須多讀書、一方須進學校或從名師補習、讀書的方法、要選定若干部書、如有關於教育的書報、　關於所担任的學科的、有關於自己所歡喜讀的、定了日程、立了表格、一面批點、一面提要、按步就班地讀下去、如果能够合多數人、組織讀書會、各自閱讀、到了一定的時期、把各人的心得報告出來、以供大家研究討論、那末、比了一個人各自閱議、更加經濟而有效得多、進暑期學校、暑期講習食、或從名師補習、應當先省察自己的缺陷和需要、各自選定功課、努力補習、小學教員應當看些甚麽書呢、有許多教育書籍中、把應讀的書目開著、但是我們　得我這些書目中精選出一部分來閱　、以免枉費工夫、多續無用的書、</p>
<p>（五）技能方面小學教員除了基本的技能外、還應有教學方面的技能、基本的技能、最重要的是關於所任學科的技能的深造、所任學科的技能能够深造、教學特才綽有裕餘、不慌不忙、而示範才能正確而有效、例如寫字、繪畫、勞作科的家事、農、工、理化的實騐等、要是自己的技能不够、對於所任的學科、怎麼能勝任愉快呢、教學方面的技能、就是教學方法、包括「教態」·「教音」·「統馭能力」「發問法」「作業指導法」「應付能力·」「考查方法」等等、大半是書本上不容易讀到、而要自己去親身體會、嘗試而得的、增進教學技能的方法、（一）自省就是時時留意自己的缺點、想法改善、最好有一個「自省表、」把小學教員應具的技能、一項一項地表列著、並且開具多項應佔的百分比、以便自己查考自己、這一類教員自省表、或者教員自省標準、在各種實際的教育書中可以查得到、在這裏不必多說、（二）參加研究會、研究關於教學方法的問題、可以聽得到別人的好意見、以供自己的參考和取法、（三）參觀別人的教學、也可以學到許多乖巧、（四）創迭試騐、這是增進教學技能的最要緊的方法、別人提議的好方法、自己去試行、再加以研究修改、創造出新的方法來、或者自已實行的方法覺得不很有效、便另行想出一個新方法來試行、再加以研究修改、創造出更新的方法來、總而言之、一面自己努力、一面取法於別人、教學的技能、才能日進不巳、</p>
<p>以上、都是關於小學教員的個人的修養方法、此外、教育行政當局、或是小學校長、如果要小學教員的知識技能進步不巳、便當督導小學教員進修、辦暑期學校、強迫小學教員入學、是一種方法、發行研究教學方法等的教育刊物、或指定若干教育書籍、強迫小學教員閱讀、也是一種方法、組織研究會輔導小學教員與會研究、又是一種方法、還有聘定專家、如國語說得很流利的人、如音樂家、如各種有技能的人、用巡迥教授的方法、往各校教授各校的教員、以增進教員的各種技能、這又是一種很有效的方法、教員不是個個能自己努力的、有許多人仍須由外來的力最督促、所以教育行政當局、或是小學校長、對於如何督促教員進修的一個問題、也得十分注意、</p>
<p>照現在的小學教育實際狀况而言、小學教員工作極忙、一天到晚、連休息的時間也沒有、那裏還有工夫修養、因此我又想到眞要小學教員修養、在教育行政機關應當减輕小學教員的種種工作、尤其是改卷子的工作、必須减到最低限度才好、在小學教員本身、也得設法經濟時間、把卷子、宿題、减少到最低限度、把改卷子的工作、分一部分給優等生去看、利用優等生做助手、</p>
<p>我這一次講演、都是老生常談、但是於有志做好教員的師範生、或許不無益處、希望諸位留意、至於師範生在做師範生時應如何修養、那便不在本問題的範圍內、不過我很希望諸位「學賽子而後嫁」、把海闊天空好高　達的心理改變過來、別輕視實際的工作、對於小學課程標準等等小學教員實在需要的書本和功課、多多留意、先弄</p>

<h3 id="c153">耗阻交連推挽式收音機 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>—不須用反相眞空管—</p>
<p>（一）不須用反相（Reversed　Phase）眞空管之理由：</p>
<p>在放大管中，柵極輸入電壓對於屛電流是在同一位相（Same　Phase），因此牠對於屛極輸出電壓則在正相反的位相，所謂反相眞空管就是司這作用的。</p>
<p>我們先來觀察在屛極所發生的電壓和在絲極所發生的電壓兩者的關係：當供給於柵極的輸入電壓為正電時，則屛電流增加，而屛電壓低减，卽輸出電壓一變而為負電，但絲極電壓反而增加，而絲極輸出電壓一變而為正電，因此在屛極與絲極所發生電壓，其位相正相反對。</p>
<p>現在如把絲極與屛極兩端適當的挿入推挽式兩管的柵極時，則可不須用反相管而容易的完成推挽式的動作。</p>
<p>（二）連接綫路：如第一圖所示，上部就是普通的耗租交連其所不同的是：在第一個眞空管絲極中與屛電路同樣，挿入一負荷耗阻，而其上端則和推挽式之另一管相連。</p>
<p>所用眞空管卽以五十七號管為電壓放大管，而以四十五號管或超四十五號管為輸出管。這裏所以採用三極管者目的是在於使發音正確，使無奇數高調波失眞（尤其是第三高調波失眞）發生之虞。</p>
<p>接綫上應注意之點；</p>
<p>（一）五十七號管之負柵耗阻與枝路電容器之連接：</p>
<p>與負柵耗阻並聯挿入之電容器，在此情形之下，是不能和普通同樣的，把一端接地，因為一接地，負荷耗阻則成短路，所以一定要挿入負荷耗阻的兩端，如果沒有把枝路電容器挿入，並且也沒有挿入別的負荷耗阻，而單把負柵耗阻自身當做負荷來運用的時候，雖不完備，但也能够工作的。</p>
<p>（二）挿入於絲極電路的負荷耗阻：</p>
<p>在絲極負荷與屛極負荷兩處所發生的信號電壓，其數值是非相等不可，日其位相又非相反不可的。雖然屛極與絲極易受簾柵電流等之影饗，但普通採用同一耗阻值的負荷已可够用。</p>
<h3 id="c154">實騐的超短波發振機 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 華萌</p>
<p>這裏來介紹一兩個簡單而易於實騐的超短波發振機，第一圖表示全機的構造，第二圖為其綫路圖，配諧用電容器的最大容量為16-20　unfd．採用普通的小號電容器三片者頗為適合，振　管採用七十一號式管（5v．）或四十五號式管（2.5v．）均可。燈絲電路中的．o5ufd枝路電容器是必須要挿入的，倘如沒有挿入，則眞空管免不了要燒壞的，</p>
<p>調幅是把推挽式成音週率變壓器的次級綫挿入在屛電路，在初級綫的一端　蜂鳴器和電鍵，他端接成音週率二級放大器的輸出，來舉行調幅，這樣不須再用份的眞空管就可以播送電報或電話。B電是供給150-200V。</p>
<p>以上的裝置如果是單用於普通發振的研究，是不成問題的，但是如果實　上要和外面通信，是不能使用的，因為其振盪週率極易變化，往往陷於不能收音之狀態，要預防這一點，應該要把發振方式改為推挽式纔好，第三圖就是表示其構造，其綫路如第四圖所示，眞空管仍用前者，而電容器及其他和前者稍有出入。變量電容器可用五片或七片之雙連者。綫圈銅綫宜用粗綫為佳。</p>
<p>L1　直徑　６　英寸　１轉</p>
<p>L2　直徑　１　　４轉</p>
<p>阻流圈　直徑　１英寸　１８轉</p>
<p>調幅時，探用定電流調幅法。根據實騐，本機不用天綫確實可達到約　K．M．之距離。發射機是否在發振可利用一與配諧綫圈同樣大小的綫圈接一年紅燈，使之和發射機的綫圈諧振，就可判明，如發射機正在發振之中，則年紅燈必發亮，如未發振時則不亮。</p>
<h3 id="c155">高週率綫圈的改良 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

<p>下圖所示的綫圈係將天棧綫圈及配諧綫圈的繞法改良繞成者，如圖所示，在絕緣圓筒１繞上配諧綫圈２，但繞時，２的兩端卽柵極部２'，及地綫部２"，須密繞，中央部２"，須繞得特別疏，又在接折２'之處，把天綫圈和2　的綫圈每隔一回相交替的繞上五四至七四。天綫綫圈是不接地的。圖中４為再生式綫圈。如２與３交替的繞時，則易於引起電容交連，故天綫綫圈數可减少，又因配諧綫圈的中央繞得疏，故可减少繞綫問的分布電容量。此種改良的繞法頗可適用。</p>

<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>如圖所示，在一個箱盒內裝置一眞空管式收音機，另外設一有把柄（6）的撥條式原動機（３）於同一箱內。其輸出迥轉軸（８）則與磁石發電機（４）相連接，由此發電機所發生的電供給於收音機（２）。這裏的所謂原動機（３）恰和留聲機中所用的原動機一樣的，由於旋轉把柄來蓄積相當的勢力，向來的收音機不是代電式，就是電池式，前者如果沒有電燈綫的地方，或是停電時，就不好使用，後者則費用和重量頗嫌過重，兩者都有不方便之處，但這種自動發電式的收音機沒有上述的不便，到處都可以　用的。（自無綫與實騐雜誌）</p>
<h3 id="c157">簡易外差式三管機（續一三八期） <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 曹潤生</p>
<p>（一）綫路簡單此機綫路極為簡單，用三只每個研究者鄱有的30號眞空管。綫路和普通三管機相倣，故極合初步者裝置。</p>
<p>（二）選擇性高超此機為外差式，故選擇性非常之好，上海各電台均能完全分淸，毫不混雜。</p>
<p>（三）靈敏度高此機之靈敏度頗優，雖祗三管而上海各電台均能於揚聲器中收聽無遺，音量較普通之管機略輕。</p>
<p>綜觀上述此機頗有一試之價值，且所費無幾，飪得嘗試外差式綫路又得實用之收音機，何樂而不為？茲將全機作法錄后：</p>
<p>LL1為高週率變壓器，可用二十六號綫繞於大號蛛網板上L1十圈，L十圈。</p>
<p>綫圈用一細木棒串住中間隔一銅皮綫圈離銅皮各一吋至此手讀完畢，使用時可將銅皮下端折成直角裝住底板上，底板則通地（見圖）</p>
<p>全部另伴備全卽可動手裝置，</p>
<p>L2L3此二綫圈卽中週變壓器，此器之優劣實能影響全機之成績，故製造時不可馬虎從事，法用木材車二個同樣大小之木心（尺寸如圖），再用二十六號單紗包綫在每個木心上各繞八百圈。二大約裝過一二隻眞空管收音機者不至於會失敗。不過校騐時須十分細心。最重要的就是校檢C2C3至最響時不可再去動它，並且要使波長短和波長長的電台有平均的音量，至此C2和C3的地位才對。平時使用時須用左右二手同時轉動CC1，C和C1刻度盤上度數大約相差十度，假使能用一雙連者亦可，調節更可簡便，但必須用墊小電容器，且校騐亦復不易，故此處採用單隻者。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c158">眞空管各極電壓的供給 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 管廷鎭</p>
<p>（一）燈絲或給熱物</p>
<p>眞空管在設計時，雖允許燈絲或給熱物的電壓及電流略可變更，但如欲效率高超，須用規定值，倘使用電壓較規定的低，則陰極的熱度也低，結果限制電子的放射，使眞空管的工作不適合，因之减少其壽命，倘使用電壓較規定的高，則陰極上的物質，容易蒸發，也可减低其壽命，所以要保持眞空管完善，當收音機啟用時，必須將燈絲或給熱物的電壓用電表來校騐，倘使燈絲是串連的可將燈絲電路中接一電流表以校正其電流。</p>
<p>燈絲或給熱物的供給，可用直流（電池或直流電源）或交流，通常用直流時，可用電阻（變量的或固定的）來調整電壓，用交流時，可用降壓變壓器來供給燈絲或給熱物的　壓，但收音機之用交直流者，則燈絲串聯起來接一降壓電阻，可直接挿入電燈綫。</p>
<p>直流燈絲或給熱物，倘用乾電池供給時，須將燈絲與電池間串聯一變量電阻來控制電池的變化，最好在收音機裏裝一只準確的電壓表或千分安培表，使眞空管的燈絲得到一種規定的電壓，電池停用時，常有需壓的變化，所以用了電阻也可作開關來阻止牠，倘有時用蓄電池或空氣電池或直流電源時，可用胡當的固定電阻，最好在初次使用時，用一電壓表或電流表來校騐，如眞空管用二弗打者可直接串聯一瓶蓄電池，如眞空管用六·三弗打者，可直接串聯一瓶六弗打蓄電池，無須再用電阻了。</p>
<p>燈絲或給熱物的電阻大小在並聯時，可應用歐姆氏定律來計算：</p>
<p>假如收音機用三只32號二只30號及二只31號接於乾電池上，則其串聯電阻等於三弗打（用二瓶乾電池串聯）减去二弗打（眞空管規定電壓）被除〇·五六安培（5xo．o6o安培十2xo．i3o安培的和），答數約為一·八歐姆，則雖二至三歐姆的電阻亦可使用，但最好購用歐姆數較大的，因尚有多數電工率消耗在電阻上，倘用歐姆數較大的，可不致過熱損壞，電工率（單位為瓦特）的算法：電阻的電壓降乘燈絲電流之和，卽　６瓦特，瓦特數旣如是之小，在一般的商品電阻，都可應用了。（待續）</p>

<p>光陰荏苒，本校自成立至今，屈指已二十週年，在過去二十年中，由摹路藍樓，艱難締造，始臻今日之規模粗具，至本校在女子高等教育上有無相當供獻，在逐年發榮滋長中，已可得其梗概，但檢討已往，足策將來，更以國步多艱，本校欲求適應時勢之需要，不能不再謀進展，故略述現狀，兼及以後計劃，就正有道，亦本校之宿願也。</p>
<p>夫高等教育，有關國家文化之隆替，責任恭重，决非少數人之智能克臻完善，本校素承社會人士，熱心愛護，恊助有加，值茲成立二十週年之期，述其梗概，編入本校校刊外，特籍此幅，撮陳一二，辱承行政長官及熱心教育人士，頒給箴言，曷勝銘感，特此誌謝，並希社會人士，本其平素愛護之熱忱，隨時加以恊助指導，則不獨本校之幸，抑亦國家之福也。</p>
<h3 id="c161">二十年來之進展 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>本校開辦於民國四年，光陰荏苒，屈指已二十週年，往事如昨，其逐年滋長擴展情形，猶歷歷在目，值茲二十週年紀念，因溯述一二，藉策來茲，並為易於明瞭起見，劃分為三時期叙述於左。</p>
<p>第一期——初創時期——民國四年至十年</p>
<p>創辦之動機吾國女子教育，由教會辦理者，為時頗早，如寗波鎭江九江　京等處之教會女學，在民國初年卽有三四十年之歷史，為時旣久，內容亦臻完善，故於民國二年夏，長江下游一帶各教會女中學校長集議，共謀女子教育更進一步辦法，蓋具有兩種理由，一為畢業升學着想，一為救濟師資缺乏起見，前者因國內當時無一女子大學，而普通大學，未開女禁，故女子中學畢業生，苟不出洋，卽無升學塲所，但出洋所費至鉅，非家境富裕者，詎能成行，且中學畢業生，年齡尚少，一旦離家遠渡重洋，對國內情形，認識尚未淸楚，亦非至善之道，關於後者，各女校欲延聘大學畢業之女教師，國內旣無造就機關，而女子由　外留學回國者，不啻鳳毛麟角，實非易得，因以上兩種原因，遂有更進一步之提議，創辦女子大學之動機。</p>
<p>籌備情形自各女中學校長提議後，卽徵求各教會之同意，因當時對擬議創辦之女子大學之標準及期望極高，知非一教會之財力人力所能措辦也，旋得長老會，美以美會，監理會，浸禮會，基督會等五公會之贊同，於是年十一月推出校董，成立校董會，故本會以十一月為成立紀念者，因校董會在是月產生也，校董會旣成立，遂擇定南京為設校地點，定校名為金陵女子大學，並推舉德本康夫人為校長，負責籌備，德夫人具辦學才，蓋籌擘畫，各方接洽，卒於民國四年籌備就緒，開始招生，在是年九月，正式上課。</p>
<p>開辦情形開辦之初，規模極小，時校舍未建，租賃繡花巷李氏住宅，學生祇有九人，來自四省，係六個女中學畢業，教職員數亦為九人，適與相等，除二人兼任外，餘均專任，可見主持者不因學生少而忽視課業，此種精神，始終保持，至經常費全年為一萬零五百元，校具等設備亦　值三千七百七十二元，參考書籍，除大英百科全書外，別無餘冊。</p>
<p>滋長情形民國五年招第二班學生，又得九人，因第一班有一人輟學，兩班合計僅十七人，治至開辦第四年，共有學生四班，而其數尚止五十有二，然比初開辦時，已範圍增大，教職員有二十三位，而倫敦聖公復初三公會，亦加入合作，美國斯密司女子大學並承本校為姊妹學校，每年由該校學生及同學會擔任一部份之經費，於是本校基礎，在此時益臻穩固。</p>
<p>第一屆畢業情形民國八年暑假，本校舉行第一屆畢業，畢業學生僅五人，得美國紐約州立大學之承認，給予文學士學位，畢業五人中，有二人任國立學校教員，二人任教會中學教員，另一人至美國醫科大學，研究醫學。</p>
<p>第二期——擴張時期——民國十年至十六年</p>
<p>購置校基建築校舍當民國九，十年間，美國各教會在中國日本印度所辦之七個恊和女子大學，已有相當基礎，為謀更進一步辦法，舉行建築校舍之大募捐，斯密司女子天學同學會亦代為捐募，於是本校得大宗建築經費，因在陶谷購置校基，鳩工庀材，着手建築，至民國十二年，中大樓，文學館，科學館及宿舍等次第完成，計校基與建築，共費銀九十餘萬元，是年秋，遷入新校舍，房屋旣寬，來學者亦日增。</p>
<p>充實內容本校自遷入新校舍後，因建築方面可暫告一段落，於是向充實內容方面努力，除圖書儀器等設備外，增聘教授，添設學程，規定學生之主修學系與輔修學系，又以校址遷至陶谷後，與金陵大學相近，兩大學為學生多得學　起見，凡高級課程，可以互選。</p>
<p>女體師之併入上海女靑年會全國協會所辦之女子體育師範學校，係招收高中畢業生受兩年之體育訓練，該校為提高學生程度起見，於民國十四年併入本校體育系辦理。</p>
<p>添設附中在民國十三年秋，本校教育學系因畢業學生，多數在各中學擔任教職，為授以教學經騐，增加服務效能起見，特設附屬實騐中學一班，此卽現在高級附屬中學之濫觴。</p>
<p>洛氏津貼金洛氏醫學基金委員會，因查本校自然科學之內容，巳達相當地步，故年給津貼金，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>第三期——改制時期——民國十六年至最近</p>
<p>校長之改選民國十六年，國府遷至南京後，大學院規定大學校長須由本國人擔任，於是本校校長德本康夫人卽向校董會辭職，並請改選國人繼任，以示服從政府法令，校董會嘉其志，遂改選吳貽芳博士為校長，吳校長係本校第一屆畢業生，曾任國立北京女高師英文部主任三年，留學美國六年，於十七年秋到校就職。</p>
<p>校名之更改自大學組織法頒布後，本校卽遵照此法準備立案，並照組織法改校名為私立金陵女子文理學院，呈請教育部立案，在民國十九年冬，正式核准。</p>
<p>體育簡易科之改專修科本校鑒於中小學體育教師之缺乏，故於民國十八年秋附設體育簡易科一班，招收高中畢業生，授以一年體育訓練，至十九年夏畢業，卽被各中小學廷聘殆盡，然畢業生中頗多願再受一年訓練者，故自十九年秋季起，改　體育專修科，定兩年卒業，業已有畢　生三　，因社會相需甚股，故至今繼續辦理。</p>
<p>附屬實中之改為高級中學附屬實騐中學目民國十三年設立以來，迄為一班，未予　擴充，至民國二十一年，因見首都女子高中有添設之需要，遂將原有一班之實騐中學，變更制度，改辦一純粹之女子高級中學，並於二十二年五月向南京市社會局立案，同時教育部亦准予備案，而校名則改為本校附屬高級中學。</p>
<p>本校之新建築本校之新建築，可分附中與大學兩部言之，（甲）附中方面，建築三層樓宿舍一座，此係孫總理夫人，孔部長夫人，蔣委員長夫人紀念來太夫人而捐資建築，旣申孝思，並惠學子，至堪感佩，（乙）大學方面，因以前建築校舍時，尚有一部份餘欵，在當時不敷建築兩座大厦之用，故暫存銀行生息，至民國二十一年，權其母子，差堪敷用，故决定提出供建築之用，以完成預定計劃，在去年此時行落成典禮，北面一座作圖書館及辦公室之用，南面一座為大禮堂與音樂室。</p>
<p>以上各點，對本校二十年來之進展情形，僅述大概，因限於篇幅，不克詳陳，但尚有一點可稱述者，教育部自上年度起，對優良之私立專科以上學校，予以補助，本校年得一萬餘元之補助費，雖為數不多，然當局能對優良之私立學校，予以獎進，是亦可誌者也。</p>
<h3 id="c162">本校之現狀及特點 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>學生之來源吾國女子高等教育機關，為數至尠，其在北方者，祇有國立北平大學之女子文理學院，在南方者，亦祇有福州之華南女子學院，至於中部，惟有本校而已，故本校學生之來源，就現在在校者之省籍言，有蘇浙皖贛鄂湘川魯豫陝冀晋遼閩粵桂黔及南洋，幾遍及全國，以畢業之中學論，則達八十校，其廣如此。</p>
<p>設備之價值本校設備，將校舍圖書儀器用具及校基等，所費已達一百五十萬元以上，若與創設時相較，則幾達五百倍。</p>
<p>科系之分設本校現設文理兩科，各科所設之學系，茲分別列於左。</p>
<p>文科　主修學系　中國文學　英國文學　歷史　哲學　社會學　音樂體育　體育系附設體育專修科　輔修學系　心理學　教育　教育系附設高級中學。</p>
<p>理科　主修學系　生物學　化學　數理　地理</p>
<p>輔修學系　衛生</p>
<p>學程之豐富就近年基督教教育協會之調查，在國內十三個基督教大學中，本校學生　常列第十或第十一，而學期授課鐘點之總數則列第五或第六，於此可見本校所設學程之豐富。</p>
<p>課程開設之準的本校學程之設置，以學生之需要為準的，如大多數畢業生將任中學教員，則設教育為輔修，冀明教育原理，教學方法，更設附中，使實習教學，多得經騐，理科各學系，同時並設特別教育法，俾知採集標本，選購儀器，採用課本等，又如近年重視社會建設，因女子性靜，宜於社會工作，則社會學系除指導主修生作各種實地調查外，並設有社會服務中心館，俾學生有認識鄰近農民小工之注活狀况，研究解决若輩之困難問題等，凡一學程，有學生五人以上之要求，卽為之設法開班。</p>
<p>注意低級學生凡一二年級學生之中英文等基本學程，均分成小組教授，以便易於分別指導，使其基礎鞏固，成績自易優良，查以往畢業生入研究院者，常能得相當榮譽，卽前年英庚欵留英考試所取中惟一女生，亦係本校畢業，此與初入校時，先施以基本課目之切實訓練不無關係也。</p>
<p>研究之風尚本校師生，對於學術之研究，空氣濃厚，各種學會，均能實事求是，如最近意阿戰爭，地理學會卽提出意阿之地理研究，使對地理有興趣之學生研究後，報告討論，而教授亦視學界之需要，出版書籍，如體育系有體操及舞蹈，魯女士有中學算學，黎博士有動物學等。</p>
<p>學識以外之訓練本校本教育卽生活之旨，素重學生各方面平衡之發展，以冀培養其整個人格及才能，茲略述一二如左。</p>
<p>一·體格之鍜鍊每年秋季開學時有體格及體能之檢騐，體格檢騐由校醫担任，如不健全者，予以特別指導或療治，體能檢騐由體育部担任，檢騐結果，分別列入激烈和緩限制等體育班，予以適當之鍜鍊，增進其健康，又授以衛生學一課，至春季再行測騐其有無進步。</p>
<p>二·幹才之訓練學法課外活動各組織，規條具備，所以訓練學生得處理事務之經騐，有應付或解决問題之方法，養成合作負責之精神，及畢業後服務社會，在學生本身戚到是項訓練之利益外，共事者亦以此見許云。</p>
<p>三·服務習慣之養成學生之所習，本為將來之準備，然若祇顧個人學識之增進，而不與外界接洽，常有不明瞭社會需要，或養成利已心之弊病，故本校學生於課餘之暇，顧到養成切實服務之習慣，茲略舉一二以明之。</p>
<p>一，學生靑年會創辦培幼小學校，自本校開辦第二年起，卽行設立，迄未中斷，且能視環境之需要而改進，最近因離校不遠已設市立小學，故於今秋改為懿範女子家政學校，收年長女生，教以家庭常識。</p>
<p>二，民國二十年，長江大水災，政府舉辦整個災區之調查，以災情之輕重分配賑欵，及各縣將調查表送齊，而調查委員會乏人整理統計，本校學生得此消息，自動供獻時間，於每晚協助整理工作，至一月有餘，方行蕆事。</p>
<p>生活家庭化而有團體之組織　本校每一宿舍有交誼室及飯廳，俾同舍生有集會塲所，如家人之聚談，至於寢室，由學生自行洒掃，並訓練簡單整潔之生活，教師於課餘之暇，與學生相處如姊妹，學生有何組織，均喜請教師為顧問，而教師亦欣然參加，故師生之間，彷彿一家之人，同學之間，更有姊妹班之組織，蓋以本校師生，大都住校，故能有此現象。</p>
<p>以上種種，僅就本校現狀或略溯旣往，拉雜述其梗概，至本校教職員之埋頭苦幹，不計待遇，畢業學生亦有赴窮鄉僻壤，如江西黎川等新收復之匪區，埋首工作，此種犧牲精神，實堪稱道。</p>
<h3 id="c163">畢業生之現狀調查 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>民國八年，本校始舉行第一屆畢業，畢業生僅有五人，此後每年俱有畢業，至今年暑假已達十七屆，服務社會，均以動懇負責，得蒙社會人士之信任，故當此職業問題嚴重時期，本校學生尚有供不應求之勢，據職業介紹部之統計，最近三年來，各方向本校聘請之人數，超過畢業生數約三倍，足徵社會人士之信用本校畢業生，殊堪欣慰，至謀深造者，數逾全體畢業生四分之一，以此數而論，在國內殊不多觀，茲為易於明瞭起見，條列於左，</p>
<p>甲·已得哲學科學博士學位者　七人</p>
<p>乙·已得醫學博士學位者　一一人</p>
<p>丙·已得碩士學位者　四九人</p>
<p>丁·現在國外留學者　十人</p>
<p>戊·現在國內繼續研究或入醫科者　九人</p>
<p>以上共計八十六人，今再將其現在所處之地域，調查統計於左，</p>
<p>現在所處之地域　人數</p>

<p>檳城　一</p>
<p>十耳其　一</p>
<p>茲更就畢業生現在所就之職業，加以調查統計如左，</p>
<p>職別　人數</p>
<p>大學校長或教授　一八</p>
<p>中學校長或主任　二九</p>

<p>一隻一隻的大肥蟹，一簍簍的陳列商店門前，「鮮大湖蟹」四個字，引起了富人的吃慾！刺痛了窮人們的心靈！</p>
<p>「蟹肥時節君須記，九月圍臍十月尖！在出售蟹的商店門前，有為臍的團尖而爭嚷！有為大小而爭奪！……陳列翁十數簍的湖蟹，在一片爭嚷聲中，已全數銷售一空。</p>
<p>這樣，一天，二天，，……天天如此，眼看着買蟹的人，把銀幣一枚枚遞進夥計的手裏，沒有絲毫吝惜！</p>
<p>喂！吃蟹的人們！現在我來告訴一伴緊要的事，就是　處災區二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇的災民，餐風宿露，急　我們去救濟！</p>
<p>省下一隻蟹錢，足以救活災民一命！黃連謹以十二萬分的誠意，代全國二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇的災民請命！</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>秋風起了，橫行公子逐漸地胸滿腸肥，正是文人們對菊吟詩的應時佐酒佳品。不一定是文人雅士，自然走卒俗子，市僧傖夫，也儘有市得　五團尖，歸家對着黃臉婆，　嚼一陣的。</p>
<p>的確，蟹味鮮美，是任誰都承認的。但不知吃蟹者，有若干知道捕蟹者的生活之痛苦。作者生長於水鄉，自幼就見到捕蟹　的生活。捕蟹是全靠着編竹而成的蟹　的。高高矮矮的竹籬，參參差差的植在河中，從東岸斷斷續續的連繫到西岸，佈成了陣勢，每一個蟹籪，置備時，在目前，大率至少也得一百元以上，每年的修理，至少也得二十元。每一個蟹籪，至多不過用十年。至於收穫呢，廢歷九十兩月中，好些的約有近二百元，不濟的年頭兒，不過一百元左右。在蟹市中，似乎收入很可觀，但過了蟹市，還有甚麽可得呢？所可得的，便是泥蝦小鯽，那些買不起錢的東西。所以「蟹人」的生活，也正像普通的農人那麼的終年在貧窮困乏中掙扎。</p>
<p>捕蟹都是在夜間的，昏黃的燈光，掛在蟹籪上，便是告訴你「蟹人」在活動。在那昏黃的燈光中，有慕光性的甲胄將軍，便緣籪而登，而為蟹人的麓中之物，這一個畫片，或許是象牙塔裏的公子哥兒，認為是富有詩情書意的，但蟹人們却沒一個不是怨天尤人，自悔着吃這一盌勞什子飯，準會有一天餓死的。因為在上海每元個的大蟹，在蟹人那裏，一塊錢至少也得三斤多些呢。</p>
<h3 id="c184">捕蟹法 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快，眨貶眼已經又到了深秋；在律頭巷尾，隨處可以聽到一阿要賣紮蟹」的聲音，於是：吾們又聯想到幼時候捕蟹的一種與趣了。</p>
<p>捕蟹：怎樣捕法？依吾東鄉的方法，約有三種，如「埭蟹」「籪蟹，」「網蟹，」這三種方法之中，要算「埭蟹」為最稱輕便而容易捕捉了。</p>
<p>埭蟹的方法，只須用網條一埭，橫斷於河港中，就能捕捉了。其網條，係用粗蔴線結成三尺闊，二丈左右的平式網條，下端的網邊上，用三寸長，三四分厚的鐵條十餘根扣牢，再用一根丈二三尺長的竹竿，將這網條挑到對河港的河邊，就將這根竹竿抽回，網條自能下沉於河底，又將靠身旁的網條之上端，用竹筷</p>
<p>根撑起，將筷子挿　河邊的泥土中，又須用油燈盞，置放於網端之旁，因為發蟹時候，必在晚間八時至一二時為止，它們見了燈光，目能投入罹網，假如這網條的上端，稍有微動時，就將網條拖起，一隻一隻的大蟹，被網眼絆牢，像聯球般接二連三的垂手可得，每次五六隻，或七八隻不等，產蟹的多少，要看天氣冷暖而定，天氣愈冷，產蟹愈多，有時竟連連不斷地每一小時可捕得數十隻，這個調調兒是很有趣的呢！但是　蟹的河港，必在淸水河，潮水河中，是很少的，而且要被潮水冲盪，所以不能用網條來埭蟹，只能用蟹網來扳蟹，或用竹籪來籪蟹，所以潮水河中捕蟹，是不大容易的。」</p>
<p>籪蟹，大概是壟斷式的，用一寸厚，一丈左右長的毛竹爿，編成竹籬式的長簾，橫斷於河心，將竹爿的下端，挿在河底，兩端再用粗麻繩綁縛在兩岸木樁上。另製一個三四尺見方一丈數尺高的竹籪，堅靠竹簾之旁，須建築堅固，那末河中游來游去的蟹，自能爬到竹簾的上端，跌入竹籪裏面，就可拿一個網兜來撈蟹了，用這個方法來捕蟹，其產量，有時比埭蟹為多，因其用壟斷手段來捕捉，眞所謂一網打盡</p>
<p>網蟹，也有二種，一種是扛「二人對拖為扛」網捕蟹，用大網一張，將網的四角的尖端，用麻繩繫牢，一端網角，綁住於河的兩岸木樁上，另有兩端的繩子，甩在橋欄杆上，須要三個人守望，約五分鐘抽網一次，網中如有魚蟹，另有一人用網兜撈起，如果沒有橋梁的河道，那來只好兩個人立在兩岸拖網，似乎很吃力的呢。</p>
<p>另有一種扳蟹，用竹頭翱好的方網，放下河中扳之，此種方法，須便利而隨處可捕，但不宜於　地河港中捕蟹，較大的湖中，儘可用這個方法捕捉呢。</p>
<h3 id="c185">横行 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>

<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>黃菊破綻，丹楓染脂，正到了持螯把酒，賞菊吟詩的時候。可是蟹雖然味美，却含有磨他命存在，能破壞人生的慷康，並且寒凉太過，食不得法，是很容易致病的。</p>
<p>蟹有江蟹湖蟹種，湖蟹肉嫩而鮮，江蟹肉瘦味淡。市上　蟹的地方，沒有一處不掛着一鮮大湖蟹」的招牌；更有幾家索興掛着「洋澄湖大蟹」的招牌，夾吸誘主顧們。那知眞正洋澄湖產的蟹，豈有這許多？老饕家如果要認識洋澄湖的真產蟹，也很容易的，蟹背是靑的，金爪，黃毛，放在金漆桌上，蟹腹能離桌面橫行，這就是有力的證明。小子供職吳門三年，有一位老饕家告訴我是這樣的，據說：「蘇州地方，吃不到眞洋澄湖蟹，都是平望鶯脰湖蟹的冒牌。」那末洋澄湖蟹到什麽地方去了呢。到上海賣好價了。</p>
<p>有毒的蟹是：獨螯，獨目，兩目相向，六足或四足，腹下有毛，腹中有骨頭，背有星點，目赤。以上的吃了容易中毒，冬瓜汁，紫蘇汁，蒜汁，豉汁，蘆根汁，都可解蟹毒的。</p>
<p>蟹能動風，有風疾的人，不吃為妙。蟹和柿相反的，切切不可食，食後發霍亂。</p>
<p>蟹的害處旣然這樣多，我們因為它味美，又不能不吃。只好在選擇的時候格外小心，拿回家中，用淸水毛刷洗净，臍中嵌入生薑一片，食鹽數粒，鍋中放入紫蘇葉一撮加水，（中藥肆有售）蟹紥好後，架在紫蘇葉面上煮沸，略燜片刻，食時多用生薑，切不可同史國公藥燒同吃！</p>
<p>蟹有九尖十團之諺，但是在廢曆九月底十月初，眞是各有其妙，腸肥膏滿，正可大快朶願，胃寒的人，食蟹後最好食龍眼湯一碗，便無胃痛腹痛之虞了。</p>

<p>— （紅羊）</p>
<p>乾蒸蟹粉乾蒸蟹粉，法用每只四五兩的淸水蟹，洗凈後置蒸籠蒸熱，剝出蟹肉，及蟹黃蟹油，剝的時候，須注重不能把黃由混和入蟹肉中，另行放開，剝好之後，取大盆一只，把蟹肉置於盆底，上鋪蟹脚和　，頂上方以黃油鋪上，略注陳酒，合以海碗，在急大隔水蒸透，即行取出，用葱末及沸豬油兩匙，澆於蟹肉之上，乾蒸蟹粉已成，食時須趁熱將另備之薑末糖醋澆入拌和，食時鮮美而有眞味。</p>
<p>芙蓉蟹芙蓉蟹乃蟹肴中的濃味，法以大蟹兜殼洗净，殼邊正中連蟹袋的兩齒殼，不能取去，用剝好　蟹粉，黃油肉次　放入殻內，　殼相平，上面鋪以肉屑，肉屑面上，以鷄蛋拌麵粉塗沒，入沸油中灸黃，加陳酒，醬油，白糖與水過過頭，以急火煮之，至湯成濃厚則成，味極濃而美，最緊要者，即為聱粉中拌以陳酒醬油白糖少許，略加葱薑末亦佳，不能加醋與鹽，而調味又須準確，不可太鹹太甜。</p>
<p>蟹羹蟹羹為羹湯的一種，法以蟹粉入葷油中略爆，加酒醬油葱薑末與水。煮之成湯，俟沸後五六分鐘，加黃粉和成羹湯，沸即盛起，蟹羹已成，如喜酸者，略加米醋亦可，但終以不加為妙。</p>
<p>金鑲玉金鑲玉即為蟹的黃油，專以黃油二物煮成，法以蟹黃蟹油，入葷油鍋爆之，即加酒醬油白糖，一沸即起，閃蟹油易溶解，故葷須極沸，入鍋後須迅速起鍋，不然蟹油即將溶入葷油的裏面了。</p>
<p>川大脚川大脚專以蟹脚和蟹螯的肉，先以鷄湯煮沸，將蟹肉傾入，沸後加酒解腥，再加鹽花，即起鍋而食，淸腴鮮美，毫無油花，是淸湯中的美味。</p>
<p>炸蟹粉條用剝就的蟹粉拌和，略加陳酒鹽花，又拌入鮮肉末，以豆腐衣包成長形，塗以鷄蛋拌麵粉，入葷油汆之，俟蛋麵發黃，即可醮醋而食，又鬆脆，又鮮美，</p>
<p>蟹粉菜心取靑菜的心，切成長約寸長條，入葷油鍋爆煮，俟菜心將爛，加入蟹粉與鷄湯少許，同煮至菜爛，加酒鹽，再煮至湯濃，即可取食，菜心之味，美於蟹粉，但此法煮時，不能蓋鍋，因蓋後菜發黃色，菜的淸香，完全失去，不蓋色靑而可保菜的眞味，倘沒有鷄湯，可加水而和入味精，也很鮮美的。</p>
<p>其餘還有種種關於蟹的食譜，因限於篇幅，不能多說，但其煮蟹，必須用好的陳酒，方可以解除蟹的腥味，這是最要緊的一件事情。</p>
<h3 id="c188">蟹的吃法 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— （影呆）</p>
<p>蟹，在水產食物中，的確是一種挺鮮美的東西，一到秋天，街頭的上面除擺滿了蟹辦之外，沿街呌賣的人，又挑了擔子，張大了喉嚨，在一蟹要哇？蟹　哇……」的狂喊着，於是人們又要來一回吃蟹的狂熱了。其吃蟹也有吃的門檻，要是吃而不得其法，便會失却美味的。</p>
<p>第一，吃蟹我們也要看時令，早秋時節，蟹才初上市，十九瘦得沒有肉，燒好了一包水，非但不鮮，還有一種苦味。嚴格的說來，西風一起，蟹才肥壯，在上月朝的左右，是吃蟹　好的時節，在廢歷九月中，大概睢蟹比雄蟹好，十月事則雄蟹好，所以有一九雌　雄」一句俗語，我們可當作吃蟹的階南呢。</p>
<p>吃蟹最爽快，當然要算上海人所說的一大炻蟹」，就是用淸水把蟹煮熟了，蘸醬油吃，不過一大炻蟹一也自有其種種吃的門檻，蟹起了水就吃當然最鮮，為了買得多一時吃不完，不免　養　天，但也不能放得日子過久，因為放得久要瘦的。煮的時候，要用冷水，如果用溫永蟹脚要脫掉的，歷時不可太久，不可過短，過久蟹肉要老，過短不熟，當你揭開鍋子來看見蟹背裂縫了就得啦。吃「大炻蟹」要吃熱的，鍋子裏拿了出來就吃最好，要用上等的本色醬油，有人以為蟹性很寒，所以放些　，胡椒等東西在醬油裏，有的人吃了蟹要潿幾口酒，還有人在煮的時候，先放些紫蘇，薑一類東西，都算可解去寒氣的。</p>
<p>蟹的吃法很多，除了「大炻蟹」之外，就把「大炻蟹」的肉剝出來，用豬油，醬油和其他作料，可以燒炒蟹粉，比蟹粉湯放得大些就是蟹羹，此外蟹燉蛋，蟹炒蛋，蟹肉絲，蟹肉圓，蟹燒豆腐，蟹燒粉皮等等，一時也說不盡，都是用剝出來的蟹肉燒的。不過我們有件事情不可忘記的，便是用蟹肉燒東西，大概開初煮蟹的湯，瀘　之後，多少要放些進去，才會格外的鮮美。</p>
<p>另外考究的人家，在九十月之間，剝了很多的蟹肉，放在鍋了裏面，和豬油一起熬，呌做蟹豬沖；凍結之後，可以久置不壞，到了嚴冬天氣，市上蟹絕跡了，在湯或菜　裏面放些蟹豬油，不但非常鮮美，而且還有一種蟹的味道。相信吃蟹的人，不妨熬些蟹豬油藏着呢。</p>

<p>蟹不可與柿及荊芥同食，老年人無不知之，但在新食品中，往往有起反應作用，誤中其毒者。小蝶之婦嫻君，曩以白蘭地佐蟹食，初不覺。歷數小時後，腹痛欲絕，取吐乃解；次蝶之婦，嘗以葡萄酒佐蟹，亦感同病。予初不信，姑並試之，殊舞異，及至中夜，忽起絞腸　痛，服吐劑無效，日腸嗚轆轆，腹壁外凸如拳，乃以稀鹽酸與大黃酒下之。欲窮其理，初閱本草載有陶宏景云：未霜之蟹有毒，乃食水莨所致，（按即西藥之顛茄）人中之，不療多死，獨螯，獨目，兩目相向，六足·四足·腹下有毛，腹中有骨，頭背有星點，足斑目赤者，皆不可食，有毒害人。李是珍云：諸蟹　皆冷，亦無甚毒，和以薑醋，侑以醇酒，咀黃持螯，略嘗風味，何毒之有，饕嗜者乃頓食，許枚，兼以葷羶雜進，飲食自倍。腸胃乃傷，腹痛吐痢，亦所必致，而歸咎於蟹，蟹亦何咎哉？愚按陶李　說，頗足以增常識。霜後持螫，吾輩視為恒事，佐之以酒，或黃或白，各有所取，黃酒解腥，白酒辟寒，雖醉飽，亦無恙也，是足以見其弊，實在葡萄酒耳。市售葡萄酒，多以糖漿與火酒偽造，而白蘭地則以酒精與愛生司配成，不必定起反應，惟我自製者，乃以眞鮮葡萄釀成，故起反應，蟹黃含燐酸錏甚富，其肉則含燐酸鉀鉅與鈣，故死蟹即發錏臭，而能化漆為水，任何漆器，用苛性鉀鈉或錏水洗之，即能褪漆，是明證也。因係強鐮性之作用，故能溶解膠漆燐酸鉀鈉，遇葡萄酸，即能分解而成葡萄酸鉀與鈉，變為單體之燐，紅頭火柴之能殺人，即燐毒也。錏即安母尼亞，本為氣體，故起腸嗚，宋玉所謂廻腸蕩氣，即是此狀，而腹痛欲絕者，則以苛性鉀鈉尅伐胃壁所致，尋常試以苛性鉀鈉，沾着皮膚，立起灼痛腐蝕，是顯著之證也。鉀與鈉以及安母尼亞，一遇鹽酸則被綠化，變為止咳下氣之藥，利用大黃之一瀉，遂如開閘放淤，悉排洩而去之，尋常中燐毒者，治之之法，亦不外此，予以飲啖較多，旣人胃腸，不復能時而出，故以大黃下之，大黃之獨長，即一瀉而止，不纏綿也。（未完）</p>

<p>鄙人所居。貼鄰卽為醫院。近水樓台先得月。嘗細察戒烟期中服何品為最愉快而無痛苦。藉為自己戒除多年老癮之借鏡。結果得悉以斯丹那氏生殖素為最效。卽向中英藥房購得四匣。依法於戒期內服用。果然一病不生。精神煥然。生殖素者。洵戒烟者有力之後盾也。</p>

<h3 id="c201">小學廢止體罰問題 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>報載敎育部據全國兒童年實施會，呈請令飭各省市敎育廳局，轉知各地小學研究會，研究提倡小學廢止體罰，並解除兒童一切束縛問題，特抄發該項原呈及研究問題，令各敎育廳局，轉飭遵辦。</p>
<p>體罰在我國私塾是很通行的，為塾師者，大都備有一塊戒尺，以便在學生書背不出，對作不來，或犯過失的時候，痛打其手心。這是體罰之輕者。此外還有重的，如令學生跪錢板或螺螄壳上的刑罰。按私塾施用體罰，用意無非在於懲戒學生，使學生因受責罰，而知所畏懼，能認眞用功，與規矩做人。這立法是否適當，可收敎育之效，原很難說。但其凶殘，實屬野蠻之至。凡小時上過私塾的，對於塾師，莫不存有一個惡劣的印象。</p>
<p>不意這種體罰，在現今還通行於小學校，眞是可怪。現今在小學讀書的學生，有時問題解答不出，或偶作頑皮的舉動，受敎員痛打，也是常事。至若比較嚴重的刑罰，還一樣可以看到，聞這類刑罰，在有些內地中學，也有採用的。故體罰在我國敎育上，已成為一個值得討論的方案。</p>
<p>惟體罰不但行於我國學校，外國學校也有這種方法。據美國洛威在所著「我們是文明麼」一書中，論敎育的一章內談：「直到近時為止，歐洲的小學敎師，常用皮鞭抽打七歲的兒童，以致終身受有傷痕。在十七八四紀，年幼的公侯以至國王，都被他們的師傅凶毆」。羅賣的「敎育論」中，論刑罰的一章，也云：「在以前直到很近的時代，兒童和少年　女的刑罰，認為當然的　，而且一般以為在敎育上是必要的。」可是這結果，却使一位前輩文生覺到兒時的過去，未必是可惜。因為他不去上學校之後，可以無須天天再怕被責罰，這是最大的便宜。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們認小學校施用體罰是不當的，應有廢止的必要，體罰　某方面，於兒童也許是有益的，但在別方面，於兒童就有損，它在敎育上，並不會有什麽效力。故我們對於這次敎育部令飭各地小學研究會，研究提倡小學廢止體罰之舉，深表贊同。今年是兒童年，我們希望敎育當局，能實行廢止小學體罰，代兒童解除一層痛苦，給兒童一個良好的印象。</p>
<h3 id="c202">失眠之夜 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>熄了燈，躺在床上，可是萬難入夢。一種沒來由的煩慮侵襲着我的心。彷彿雨天的悒鬱的雲片，沉重的壓得我喘不過氣來。眼珠睜着，可是有什麽好看呢？帳頂是糢糊的，帳外當然也是朦朦朧朧……我十分淸楚，我知道這又是失眠之夜。我挺着身子，倔强地想，我準備擔當失眠者的所有的苦惱！</p>
<p>於是一顆俋鬱的心放蕩起來了。想着各色各種的幻滅的夢，絳色，橙色，灰色，紫色，黑色……於是沉浸在空虛裏，我輕輕地嘆了一口氣，是那麽微弱，彷彿風中的一根斷殘的蜘蛛絲。揭開帳門抬着頭望着院子，院子是寂寞的。就是慣常掙破院子的寂寞的小雀子此時也不再噪鬧了。兩株老柏樹陰森的同時又是頑强的直立着，它似乎在威嚇着什</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>麽。這滿院的寂寞許是它釀製的吧？靜謐裏，我彷彿聽到　珠沾上深秋的草尖的聲音，我彷彿聽到老銀杏的葉子的透氣……</p>
<p>老銀杏，到了這兒來我纔認識它。我常常用着探險者的態度試探着它的一切。它特別雄偉，在院子裏東西相對着。東邊一株是雄的，傾斜着身子，伸開了老臂膊。晚上的藍天，特別藍，特別高，雄的老銀杏我知道它愛做荒唐的夢，它似乎一心一意的想抱住藍而高的天。雌的那株却比較慈祥，常常有熟爛的菜子禿的一聲落下來因為無人採擷的緣故，所以菓子老是落不完。它的第一顆菓子的落下，遠在半個月以前，但現在是還有菓子落下來，也許再半個月還是落不完的吧。兩株老銀杏都是百餘歲的老者了，它的記憶十分古舊。每當向晚時份，一片血紅的光輝映射在樹枝上，老銀杏煩瑣的說着許多古老的故事。它會說孔廟的紅牆早已褪色了，褪色後又塗上了紅，紅又褪色了。它會說深夜裏有妖媚的狐狸在院子裏擺動着尾巴。它更會說椽柱間的小雀子不知傳了幾代了。一切荒唐的，古老的，怪異的故事，它都知道得淸楚，它是一本正確的歷史敎科書呢。</p>
<p>躺在床上，睜着眼，靜聽得禿的一聲，知道又是那株雌銀杏落下的菓子。接着一陣夜風輕輕地飄，樹葉便悉悉索索的飄下來，一張，一張，我知道它貼在草上，或貼在泥土上了。又是禿的一聲，落下一顆銀杏，又是禿的一聲，落下一顆銀杏……這聲音，特別來得大，來得淸晰，敲碎了夜的深深的夢……</p>
<p>於是蒼白的月兒從樹梢上爬起來了。病樣的冷冷的光颺進窗來，掛在牆壁上的字書塗上了一片乳白的糢糊。仔細地看去，　疎的老銀杏的影子透過窗來映射在地板上，這是秋夜月的傑作吧？不常擺動的老柏樹還是用着威嚇的姿勢在鎭壓着一切。為了得不到陽光照耀而帶着病態的四五株菊花躲在牆的一角怯憐憐的似乎經不起夜風的微撼。小草瑟縮　等待着面冷心熱的露珠的滋潤。我呢，摸索着牀沿，摸索着檯角，望着窗外，並回看着自家的瘦瘦的影兒壓上了秋夜月的傑作——老銀杏的透過窗來的蕭疎的影子。我幾乎疑惑自家是一個可怕的幽靈！</p>
<p>我不想扭亮燈，更不想找一二篇文章以排遣自家的寂寞。我準備擔當失眠者的所有的苦惱。夜，雖正深，正長，但我是預備着蒼白的月兒橫過西天，從西窗颺進病樣的冷冷的光的。我有一顆臨刑時的囚犯的倔强的心，我要看東天的曙光的放射。</p>

<p>— 新野</p>
<p>一個初冬的上午，氣候却出乎意外的寒冷；那灰黃色的陽光只無力地照射在一個平坦的山坡上，坡的週圍昆連地擠着五六間矮屋，但多數已有點斜斜欲傾的樣子了。坡前伸着一條弧形的泥路，迤邐向東，就可接通逍遙宮上那條大路，從這里可以到鎭上，和石灰窰上去的。路側一個死水池沼，池的盡頭還有一口石井；這些就是供給坡上人家飲水和洗東西的了。現在池里的水巳經剩了一半，並且因為是死水，所以已變了深綠色，水面上還給一層薄薄的冰凍凝着，不過在「踏渡」口的幾處，因早上給人洗菜淘米而攪開了。那時浮在池中的幾根毛松樹上，正有幾頭小麻雀在悠閒地，活潑地跳躍噪叫，有的在修自己的翅膀，有的却在池邊黃菜葉堆里翻尋毛穀。</p>
<p>靠西那株老梅樹下，是一所破頹了的十地廟，它孤零零的離開那些矮石屋約莫有十來步，獨自個兒靜穆地坐在那兒。廟前却堆滿了一排高低參差的稻草堆；那是坡上人家秋收剛過，還沒把那些稻草擱到屋子里去。一條癩瘦狗當着太陽蹲在那里咬狗癟——</p>
<p>時是　開晌午祇一忽兒了；坡上人家，男的女的都到山上去打柴的打柴，每一家的門緊騰騰的關着。週遭是那麽靜悄悄地，除了偶然飛來一兩隻鵲子落在人家瓦脊上，或老梅樹上叫幾聲外，整個山坡的空氣是沉悶的眞像死了一般，幾乎連一點兒生意都找不出。</p>
<p>獨有被人遺忘在土地廟里的木公公，正在咳嗽着從發着霉氣的墻角里那隻堆着破花絮的草舖上掙扎起來，可是不知怎的。一串咳嗆來不及的望他胸頭寒了上來：他覺得今天頭腦脹得厲害，腦袋沉重，眼皮更是抬不起，房子，地面，什麼都在他眼前轉，轉他自家的人也在跟着轉。腰骨是疼痛得像有人在折。他合上眼睛，重新倒了下去，但一串一串的咳嗆又從喉管里爬了起來。</p>
<p>「霜降過了吧！斷命的老病又要發了，發…死了…也…好…」他自語着，但尾音似帶着沉重的顫抖。</p>
<p>他勉强摸到了門口，就在一堆稻草上艱難地坐了下來，將一個身體靠在稻草上，望着那淡而無力的太陽。他說起話來常常是痙痙地那麽吃力，「嗯呀！嗯呀！」的。他的臉上是枯瘦而帶着濃重的陰暗，一骷髏頭顱的形像，有一對枯澀而沒有神的眸子。那一叢灰白的鬍鬚上，凍凝着的淸水鼻涕，像一排珠子似的貼在上面耀光。身上穿的那襲破棉襖，一塊一塊的爛棉絮打從窟窿里擠出來了，坐在太陽底下，身子還是不住地在哆嗦！」</p>
<p>他時常自己怨着命，希望自己早點死了，省得這樣活受罪，可是他終於沒有死，還是這樣地拖拖一年；這病越到冬天越來得兇；木公公悲哀地，把一雙望着太陽的眸子不十分活靈的轉動了一下，但是眼眶子里貯滿着的亮晶的淸淚，似乎要從睫毛尖上跳出來。</p>
<p>太陽歪到了南方，依然是頹喪得像個雅片鬼的臉，只得一些疎林的影子挪了一個位置，可是風却在刮得樹梢有些抖了。</p>
<p>忽然，躺在另外一個稻草堆上那條癲瘦狗，伸了一個懶腰，站起來，曳着那支垂直的尾巴走到木公公身邊，很親暱的在他身上噢了一回就溫和在他跟前躺了下來，牠也好像懂得木公公內心的一種悲哀似的，給了他一種同情的撫慰……</p>

<p>秋</p>
<p>秋天了，我有顆秋海棠的心。</p>
<p>秋海棠的心是寂寞，而且凄淸的。</p>
<p>白天，看着靑的或是灰白的雲，看着不變的烟突，看着烟突裹慢慢散去的烟，這是秋天。</p>
<p>晚上，一盞十支光的電燈，聽着窗外的雨，雨聲像低訴也像哭，此外是一片的靜，連秋蟲的聲音都沒有，秋是深了。</p>
<p>空燒去不少的烟捲，空喝乾不少壺的開水，心還是像淡白的雲。</p>
<p>沒有憤怒，憤怒是能够加强反抗的意志的；也沒有計劃和希望，有了計劃和希望那纔有裹傷再戰的勇氣；有的祗是一顆茫茫的跟白雲一般的心，有的祗是一顆寂寞而且凄淸的秋海棠似的心。</p>
<p>夏過去了，冬天還沒有來，春天嗎？去得太長久了，來的日子又太遼遠，雖然知道春天是必然會來的。</p>
<p>能幹些什麽呢？除了望着灰白的雲，望着烟突，望着漸漸散去的烟。</p>
<p>或者在十支光的電燈下，聽着一片的靜。</p>
<p>友誼</p>
<p>有位朋友說過；「朋友終究是朋友，父親也祗是一個親戚。」</p>
<p>我讀到那封信，我看到了那位朋友的憤怒，我見到了那位朋友的臉是紅紅的，又喝了不少的酒。</p>
<p>果然，第二天又有信來了，他勸我把先前那封信毀掉。</p>
<p>理由是：別得罪朋友吧，這是我酒後失言，</p>
<p>我把那封信毀掉，可是我把那句話抄在手冊上了。</p>
<p>現在，用不到那手冊，我便能把那二句話背誦出來：</p>
<p>「朋友終究是朋友，父親也祇是一個親戚。」</p>
<p>——友誼，如果僅僅建築在私有的關係上，那終會有破滅的一天的。</p>

<h3 id="c205">寳石山上 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>早上，天空吊下來飄忽的絲雨，那慘淡的顏色廣漠地展開。從小小的房子的窗子望出去，樹枝和葉片輕輕地盪搖。杭州的市塲還是那麽沉寂的呢，然而這樣的天氣，對於我是多麽的失望呀！從遠遠的地方到這兒來，却天天要下着絲雨的呀！然而，終是我的興奮的緣故，很快地就跑到馬路上，買了一把紙傘，準備在雨天里登山去玩。這時候，我的心里起伏地煽着一種不安的冒險的氣息。因為，杭州的山路，我不認識，尤其是在這樣凄凉靜寂的雨天里，多少都有點不同平常的。</p>
<p>繞着湖濱向西北那兒跑着的時候，迎面掠來一陣一陣的秋風，透進心胸里，感到一種異樣的淸凉。當然，這時候沒有多個遊客，一片平靜的湖面給微雨打盪着。大約跑了二十多分鐘，從後湖畔的寳石山　的關大的山路上灣了上去。就可以望見寳俶塔好像嬌艷的美人似的矗在山頂上，不過，這倒斜的山峯，在山下看去時却給一座荒蕪的茅草和綠葉隱約地遮着半邊了。</p>
<p>這路上多麽冷靜的呀！兩邊是叢林的黑影在盪搖，透出來的哨聲，溜進了我的耳朶里。沒有鳥兒的歌語，宇宙只是一片沉寂的凄凉。而且山路是那麽高的，我的心里就起了緊張的情緒，也許可以說是怖恐，睜大了眼睛小心地向左右前後探望。這樣子連自己也感到無限的可笑來。登了許多路，才到了半山腰，那兒盡是荒蕪的茅草，好容易才找到了一條可行的灣澧的小徑。走進一座頽廢的廟宇去時，只看到殘毀的灰色的牆圍和冷靜地描劃在上面的古怪的書圖和字樣。從一級一級的石梯上登上去，又在茅草堆里兜了兩個灣，才到寳石塔邊。這時，自己一向給怖恐着的緊張的心情才輕鬆了下來。</p>
<p>寳石塔是高尖的，跟別個地方的古塔不同，牠好像一個嬝娜的美人，很高傲地站在山頂上，俯視着杭州的景物，面臨着平鏡似的湖水。這時，已沒有了雨，所以，我坐在塔邊，靜靜地享受孤獨者的幸福，迷着眼珠子的，想起夜里的湖面所望見的寳石塔是周身吊着閃閃的電燈的。正好像美人穿了艷而奪目的衣服一樣。而且，這塔又好像瘦小而長的竹筍一樣，古有「雷峯如老衲，保俶如美人」的詩句，如今，我可以看到了，尤其是在夜里，更可以證明詩句是眞切的。</p>
<p>遠遠地眺望着迷在濃厚的烟　里的山峯，隱隱約約地。如貝形的西湖的水波跟慘淡的天空沒有兩樣的，廣漠地展開而且述接着。「水天一色」拿來比喻秋天的幽靜的西湖也很眞切吧。在這兒，還可以望見好像一隻巨大的鳥兒展開了翼翅的伏在西湖中的北孤山。北孤山叢生着葱綠的樹林，山里的一切都看得不淸楚，只可以看到牠是給生滿了楊柳的白堤和紅木的博物會橋連貫着湖濱。放鶴亭和徐小靑墓並排着在後湖之濱上，也只是一個渺小的形樣，正好像湖上的殘荷一片一片地在我的眼眶里盪搖着一樣。</p>
<p>靜寂的寳石山上，我已享受到一切的秋天的風景了，於是，我在荒蕪的山野里，在高而險的石峽的小徑中，哼着喻快的調子，穿過了來鳳亭，又向那怖恐的茅草里探求去了。</p>

<p>護生歌</p>
<p>（一）人為萬物之靈，因為人有人的知能，人有人的意志，人有人的感情。建立了人的文化，且是不停地推進；擴大了人的力量，於是統制了衆生。</p>
<p>（二）人為萬物之敵，因為人秉人的威　，人使人的利器，人逞人的凶殘。為着那人的享受，養成殺生的習慣，漸變作人的娛樂，滿足慘酷的快感。</p>
<p>（三）請看那鞭子下的馬牛，破皮爛肉；請看那快刀下的禽獸，炙骨熬油，三朋四友，用百萬生靈，來佐飯，下酒。有恩於人的益蟲益鳥，也予取予求。損壞了人情中仁慈寬厚，養成了人類的狠心辣手，終致人對人永不息地互相戰鬥，可憐人殺人只殺得那白骨成丘！</p>

<p>足與「英宮秘史」相抗衡</p>
<p>英國影片，因為他們的作品，進步極速，所以近來在國外電影市塲上，很佔有一部份勢力。最近有一部宮闈歷史鉅片「丹宮恨史」Loves　of　A　Dictator，已經運到中國，不久將在上海公映，這部片子為英國銀壇導演聖手維克多薩維兩所導演，主角為美國明星克拉夫勃洛克和英國明星曼琳凱洛爾等，該片在美國紐約最大影院洛克西公映時，歷時一月，賣　不衰，美國報章雜誌，極端揄揚，其受美邦人士的歡迎，於茲可見。</p>
<p>這部片子，攝製費用達一百萬金鎊，成績之優越，曾經轟動一時的「英宮秘史」，較之猶有遜色。內容所述，係關於十八世紀丹來宮闈中的一段羅曼斯，情節哀感頑艷，演出戟刺幽默，且能處處根據史實，尤為難得，在宮闈影片中，的確可以算得一張數一數二的作品，好，在公映之期，不久將至，影迷們等着瞧罷。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sixth Plenary Session Inauguration Ceremony Completed: President Wang Targeted by Assassin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shot three times; immediately sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. Assailant Sun Fengming and accomplice apprehended on the spot.</p>
<p>Meeting continued as scheduled after the incident.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, after the conclusion of the Sixth Plenary Session's opening ceremony, at 9:30 AM, while a photograph was being taken at the entrance of the First Conference Hall, two assassins wielding handguns opened fire on Wang Jingwei. Wang was struck three times and collapsed. Central Committee member Zhang Ji seized the assailant Sun Fengming from behind, embracing him around the waist, while Zhang Xueliang knocked the gun from his hand and kicked him to the ground. Wang's guards opened fire, hitting the assailant, who was apprehended on the spot. Chiang Kai-shek was inside at the time. Subsequently, military police secured the entrances to the Party Headquarters and conducted a search, apprehending six suspects, including one woman who also carried a handgun. Based on their actions, the intended target appeared to be more than just Wang.</p>
<p>Military Police Search "Chenguang News Agency"</p>
<p>The assassins were able to infiltrate the venue by recently registering with the Central Party Headquarters under the guise of operating the "Chenguang News Agency" and obtaining access passes. The registered president was named Hu Yunqing. When military police rushed to search the agency, the premises were already deserted. Documents had been burned, and embers were still smoldering. Examination of the remaining fragments of text revealed much inflammatory propaganda.</p>
<p>Wang Is Conscious and Out of Danger</p>
<p>After Wang was taken to the Central Hospital, diagnosis by Liu Ruiheng and Shen Kefei revealed that the bullet wounds were not deep, and no major blood vessels were ruptured. An X-ray was scheduled for the afternoon. Wang's mind was very clear. Liu Ruiheng stated that if there were no post-operative complications, his life should be out of danger.</p>
<p>Foreign Envoys Offer Condolences to President Wang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After learning that President Wang had been wounded by an assassin, the U.S. Embassy in China sent condolences to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the same day, expressing deep concern for Wang's condition. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Embassy sent Secretary Matsumura on the 1st to represent Ambassador Arita in conveying condolences to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for President Wang. Military Attaché Amemiya also visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer condolences. In addition, Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov visited Tang Youren at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at around 3:00 PM on the 1st to personally convey his condolences.

<p>(Nanjing) After news of Wang's assassination attempt spread, German Ambassador Trautmann personally visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:50 AM on the 1st to offer condolences. In the afternoon, Secretary Feller of the Italian Embassy also visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent Italian Ambassador Lojacono in offering condolences.

<p>(Nanjing) Upon learning that Wang had been wounded by an assassin, the Japanese Embassy in China immediately sent Secretary Matsumura to represent Ambassador Arita in conveying condolences to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Military Attaché Amemiya also visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer condolences. In addition, the Russian Ambassador visited Vice Minister Tang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the afternoon to personally convey his condolences. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>The Assailant Remains Silent Under Interrogation</p>
<p>When the assailant Sun Fengming was captured, he was also shot in the leg by Wang's guards. He was also injured in the chest by police officers while the gun was being seized. He was also sent to the Central Hospital. Under interrogation by the police, he remained silent, only stating that he was from Xuzhou and had served as a platoon leader in a certain army.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Personally Watched Over Him at the Hospital for Several Hours</p>
<p>After Wang was shot, Chiang immediately ordered doctors to be summoned by telephone and personally directed the stretcher bearers at the hospital, appearing very anxious. After Wang arrived at the hospital, Chiang rushed there and watched over him for several hours. All the other Central Committee members also went to the hospital to visit him. Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, remained calm after Wang was shot, embracing Wang and comforting him, saying that it was to be expected that a revolutionary leader would be targeted by assassins.</p>
<p>President Wang, Attacked Yesterday</p>
<p>Internal Security Check Conducted at Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>After the incident, the Central Party Headquarters was sealed off. Everyone inside, except for Central Committee members, including Party officials and news reporters, were subjected to a security check by military police before being allowed to leave at 2:00 PM. It was reported that a few minutes after the gunshots were heard, a man in a Western suit reported the assassination attempt by telephone to the Public Relations Department. Party Headquarters staff suspected him of being an accomplice and turned him over to the police. A stray bullet passed through the trouser leg and sock of Central Committee member Zhou Qigang without causing injury. Zhang Chong, head of the Film Department, confirmed that the assassin's handgun was a revolver, with two bullets remaining unfired. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sixth Plenary Session, which was the focus of national attention, held a solemn and grand opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 1st. Unexpectedly, after the ceremony concluded and all the Central Committee members had finished taking a photograph, a serious assassination attempt occurred, resulting in Central Executive Committee member and President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, being shot by the assassin Sun Fengming. This was an unprecedented and shocking crime at the Central Party Headquarters, and all parties are paying extraordinary attention to it. The assassin Sun Fengming and two accomplices were all arrested on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Assassin Strikes: At 9:00 AM on the 1st, all Central Committee members held the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session in the Central Auditorium, presided over by Committee Member Wang, who also delivered the opening address. After the ceremony, all Central Committee members went to the entrance of the First Conference Hall to take a photograph. During the photograph, the Central Committee members stood in five rows. Wang, along with Zhang Jingjiang, Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang, and other committee members, were in the first row for the photograph, which was completed at 9:35 AM. The committee members then turned to return to the conference hall. Unexpectedly, at this moment, the assassin opened fire on President Wang.</p>
<p>Wang Wounded: The assassin, Sun Fengming, was dressed in a Western suit and wore a jacket. During the photograph, he mingled among the audience near the cameras with two accomplices, showing no unusual behavior, so he did not attract attention. When the photograph was finished and the committee members turned to return to the conference hall, the assassin suddenly emerged from the crowd, pulled a handgun from his jacket pocket, and fired repeatedly at President Wang, catching everyone off guard. President Wang immediately fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Assassin Captured: When the assassin fired the gun, Central Committee member Zhang Ji, who was standing next to President Wang, immediately rushed behind the assassin and embraced him tightly around the waist. However, the assassin continued to fire wildly, for a total of about seven or eight shots. At this time, Zhang Xueliang had also rushed to the front of the assassin and kicked him to the ground. President Wang's guards also raised their guns and fired one shot at him. The assassin immediately fell to the ground, and the two accomplices standing behind the assassin immediately ran away, but were eventually apprehended by the guards.</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital: When President Wang was wounded and fell to the ground, Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who had already stepped into the door, ran out upon hearing the gunshots. Seeing the situation, he immediately stepped forward to help President Wang up, and with the assistance of other committee members, carried him to the conference room. He immediately used the telephone to notify the Central Hospital. The hospital director, Liu Ruiheng, and the chief of surgery, Shen Kefei, immediately rushed to the Central Party Headquarters in an ambulance. After bandaging President Wang's wounds slightly, they had him lie on the ambulance bed. Chiang Kai-shek, Kong Xiangxi, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, and Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, carried him onto the ambulance and sent him to the Central Hospital for treatment. Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Bijun accompanied him personally. Chiang Kai-shek then returned to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the meeting.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Wounds Not Serious: It is reported that President Wang's injuries are not serious. (The Central Hospital's medical record is recorded separately). After the assassin Sun Fengming was shot, he was also transported to the Central Hospital for treatment, hoping to obtain a confession. Apart from President Wang, no other Central leaders were injured. Only one worker was hit by a stray bullet in the leg, but it is not a serious injury.</p>
<p>More Suspects Apprehended: After the incident occurred, the police officers serving as guards at the Central Party Headquarters immediately took action and imposed martial law, cutting off traffic and conducting searches. Police Chief Chen Zhuo and Gendarmerie Commander Gu Zhenglun personally directed the searches, which were completed at around 1:00 PM. Several more suspects were subsequently arrested.</p>
<p>Committee Members Visit: The preparatory meeting of the conference still opened at 10:30 AM, with Chairman Yu Youren expressing his regret. Zhang Ji also gave a detailed account of witnessing the assassin commit the crime and being captured. All the committee members present were deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident and went to the hospital to visit after the meeting.</p>
<p>The Case Is Under Investigation: The assassin, Sun Fengming, is a field reporter for the Nanjing Chenguang News Agency, in his twenties. On the 31st, he obtained access pass number 63 from the Central Party Headquarters press reception desk. No one suspected that he would commit this unlawful act. When the incident occurred, the military police immediately rushed to the agency to surround and search it. All personnel had already fled before the incident occurred. All documents were also burned in the stove. Only a letter left on the desk was found, with the words "Leave for those who come" written on the envelope, and the words "The affairs of this agency have nothing to do with Guo Zhimou, Wu Huang, and Zhou Xiling. We hereby declare" written on the note. The handgun used in the assassination was seized on the spot. It was a Spanish-made six-shot revolver, gun number 8679. According to the assassin, it was purchased in Shanghai. All six bullets had been fired. Five empty shell casings were left in the cylinder. The reporter access pass worn by the assassin was introduced by Guo Zhimou to Wu Huang and Zhou Xiling, so they were able to obtain it from the Central Party Headquarters. According to current investigations, the assassin's intention to assassinate was not initially limited to Wang alone, and the arrangements before and after the event were meticulously planned, making them undoubtedly communist bandits. The remaining members of the group are now being closely pursued in order to bring them to justice and punish them. Of the ten or more suspects apprehended today, some were those who acted hastily and did not heed police instructions during the incident at the Central Party Headquarters, and some were those who followed Chiang Kai-shek to and from the mausoleum this morning, acting suspiciously. The adjutant recorded their vehicle license plate numbers and notified them to be detained after the incident occurred. They are now being interrogated in detail in order to get to the bottom of the matter. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Closed: After the unfortunate incident occurred, the Standing Committee immediately decided to temporarily close the Central Party Headquarters during the Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth National Congress, and the Secretariat issued the following notice: "According to the Standing Committee's discussion, all staff members of the Party Headquarters, except those with duties at the Secretariats of the Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth National Congress, will be given a holiday after inspection during the sessions. Regular access passes will not be valid. This is hereby announced. Central Secretariat." (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek and Others Did Not Visit the Hospital</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang is staying in room 251 of the Central Hospital. After 11:00 AM, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Yang Yongtai, Chen Cheng, Xu Mo, Zhu Peide, and more than 100 Central Committee members in Nanjing went to visit. Only Chiang Kai-shek and Kong Xiangxi personally entered Wang's room. Chiang Kai-shek and Kong Xiangxi personally conveyed their condolences. Wang wanted to talk a little, but Chiang asked him to rest and recuperate, and then took his leave. According to Chu Minyi, who spoke to Central News Agency reporters at the hospital at 1:35 PM, Wang's injuries have been confirmed to be only injuries to the back ribs, and a detailed examination will be performed in the afternoon before surgery. Doctors have examined Wang's body temperature and found it to be 37.8 degrees, with a pulse of 88 beats per minute. Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, and his sons and daughters, as well as Zeng Zhongming, are all at the hospital attending to him. Wang's spirits are excellent and he speaks as usual, frequently saying, "My injuries are not serious, don't panic." (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Good Spirits After Surgery</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang was unfortunately targeted by the criminal Sun Fengming, all the important figures in the Central government were extremely indignant about this matter. Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang, Sun Ke, Dai Jitao, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, and all the Central Committee members and heads of various institutions in Nanjing went to the hospital to offer condolences. Feng Yuxiang, who arrived in Beijing from Tai'an on the 1st, also went to the hospital to visit after receiving the news. Representatives from various provinces and cities and overseas who came to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress were also heartbroken and went to the hospital to inquire about President Wang's condition. It is reported that the handgun used by the criminal was a four-inch Browning bullet. Although Wang was hit by three bullets, none were vital organs, and the injuries were not serious. There was no change in the afternoon. In addition to the Central Hospital's treatment, a plane was sent to Shanghai to bring bone specialist Niu Huilin to Beijing at 3:00 PM to assist in the treatment. The bullet in President Wang's back ribs was examined with an X-ray at around 3:00 PM. According to the doctor, President Wang's health will definitely not be in danger. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Shen Kefei and Liu Ruiheng used X-rays to examine the two bullets in President Wang's left cheek and back ribs, surgery was performed at around 4:00 PM to remove the bullet from the left cheek. During the surgery, Wang did not want to use anesthesia due to his strong physique, but because the incision was about an inch long, the area was slightly red and swollen. The bullet in the back ribs was embedded between the two ribs and was not easily removed at the time, but it was not a major issue. According to the doctor, it would not matter if it was not removed in the future. The surgery was completed after 5:00 PM, and Wang's spirits were still very good and he ate some fruit. According to the doctor's report at 10:00 PM, Wang's body temperature and pulse were still the same as when he was admitted to the hospital, with no changes. The previous telegram reported that Niu Huilin would come to Beijing, but it has been found to be misinformation. Chiang Kai-shek, Ye Chucang, Zhang Xueliang, and others visited the hospital again at 8:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang's condition showed no change in the afternoon. At around 3:00 PM, X-rays were taken to examine the bullet wound in the shoulder and ribs. Feng Yuxiang arrived in Beijing and went to the hospital to visit Wang at 3:00 PM, but was unable to meet him because Wang was undergoing examination. Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Liu Zhi, and dozens of others also went to the hospital to offer condolences after 3:00 PM, and were received by Zeng Zhongming. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang was shot a total of three times, once in the left cheek, once in the left arm, and once in the back ribs. He arrived at the Central Hospital at around 11:00 AM. According to the doctor's X-ray examination of the wound on his cheek, the bullet did not enter the bone, and was still in the skin outside the bone. The bullet had exited the wound on his left arm, without damaging the bones or blood vessels. The location of the bullet in the back ribs had not yet been found by X-ray. Because President Wang needs rest now, it is planned to examine it again in the afternoon. At present, President Wang is in good spirits and speaks clearly, but feels pain in his back and swelling under his left eyelid. According to doctors at the Central Hospital, Wang's injuries should not be a major problem. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>No Change in Condition Late at Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding President Wang's injuries, Central News Agency reporters went to the Central Hospital again at 12:00 AM on the 1st to visit. According to the doctor, President Wang's condition has not changed, and his pulse and body temperature are still the same as when he was admitted to the hospital.

<p>Various Agencies to Conduct Strict Interrogation of Criminals Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The assassins arrested on the spot were the principal offender Sun Fengming and two accomplices, and four suspects. Except for Sun, who was sent to the hospital, the rest were sent to the police station. It was decided that on the 2nd, the main leaders of the Party, government, military, and police agencies would jointly conduct a strict interrogation. Sun is a reporter for Chenguang News Agency. After the incident, police officers immediately rushed to the agency to search it, but no one was found. Only many traces of burned documents were found in the stove, as well as remaining pieces of paper. Editorial manuscripts and other items were copied from the office and taken for research. This time, the Central Party Headquarters' restrictions on reporters entering and exiting were stricter than in the past, requiring a photo. The assassin went to collect the access pass on the 31st, but it was not complete, and he only received it on the morning of the 1st. During the 9:00 AM opening ceremony, reporters had to sign and match their photo when entering the venue. The criminal did not enter the auditorium, and no one expected that he would deliberately commit this outrageous act during the photography of the Central Committee members. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chen Zhuo Says Criminal Was a Communist</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding President Wang's assassination, Police Chief Chen Zhuo told Central News Agency reporters that the criminal in this case, Sun Fengming, had been interrogated and confessed that he was from outside the East Gate of Chuzhou, Anhui Province, 32 years old, and had served as a platoon leader in the 19th Route Army and a company commander of a machine gun company in the Mixed Regiment of the 12th Division of Fujian. He had been in Beijing for over a year, working as a reporter for Chenguang News Agency, and conspired with the agency's president Hu Yunqing and editor-in-chief He Poguang to assassinate President Wang for a long time. The revolver used in the assassination was given to him by Hu Yunqing, and the Central Propaganda Department's reporter access pass number 63 was obtained by He Poguang. Chenguang News Agency was registered by Hu Yunqing and others with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in October last year, originally located at 2 Wangheting Road, and later moved to 23 Lujia Lane. After this case occurred, the bureau sent police officers to the agency to search for the remaining members of the group, but all the personnel in the agency had already fled before the incident occurred, and all the documents had been burned in front of the stove. However, a letter was found on the desk with the words "Leave for those who come" written on the envelope, and the words "The affairs of this agency have nothing to do with Guo Zhimou, Wu Huang, and Zhou Xiling. We hereby declare" written on the note. The handgun seized on the spot was a Spanish-made six-shot revolver, gun number 8679. According to the criminal, it was purchased in Shanghai. All six bullets had been fired, and five empty shell casings were left on the cylinder. The reporter access pass worn by the criminal was introduced by Guo Zhimou to Wu Huang and Zhou Xiling, so they were able to obtain it from the Central Party Headquarters. According to the current investigation, the criminal and others deliberately planned the assassination, and their initial target was not just President Wang. The arrangements before and after the event were meticulously planned, making them undoubtedly communist bandits. The remaining members of the group are now being closely pursued in order to bring them to justice and punish them. Of the ten or more suspects apprehended today, some were those who acted hastily and did not heed police instructions during the incident at the Central Party Headquarters, and some were those who followed Chiang Kai-shek to and from the mausoleum this morning, acting suspiciously. The adjutant recorded their vehicle license plate numbers and notified them to be detained after the incident occurred. They are now being interrogated in detail in order to get to the bottom of the matter. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to official sources, Wang Jingwei was shot three times. The most serious bullet wound was in the back, penetrating the left lung. There were a total of three assassins.

The two tried to resist arrest, but were eventually captured. Military police are now conducting a thorough search of the Party Headquarters to prevent any remaining members from hiding. According to witnesses, Zhang Ji bravely seized one of the assassins at the time, saving Wang's life. However, Zhang Ji was also hit by a bullet in the hand. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Yesterday's Unfortunate Event in the Capital <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— The Capital</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee held its opening ceremony and the members had finished taking photographs, just as they were about to re-enter the venue, a sudden act of assassination took place. President Wang was shot three times and rushed to the Central Hospital for treatment. When the news spread, everyone was shocked and frightened. The local bond market even suspended trading because of this, indicating the severity of the matter. It is truly unprecedented in the capital for such a violent incident to occur at a grand event of the Central Party Headquarters, attracting nationwide attention, and with high-ranking Central officials in attendance. The impact of this event is significant enough to shake the world's attention and is not merely a major misfortune for the country.</p>
<p>The sudden occurrence of this incident has led to varied and speculative conjectures. Fortunately, all three perpetrators have been apprehended. Under thorough investigation, it will not be difficult to uncover the truth. Before the inside story is clarified, we are unwilling to make hasty comments. However, one point must be deeply lamented. Such an act of assassination is not something that can be carried out anywhere. At a time of serious national crisis, we depend on the sincere unity of all parties. The Sixth Plenary Session gathered leading figures together to jointly plan major national policies. Prior communication was not easy, and the people's expectations were high. However, this unexpected attack endangered the highest administrative official, increasing discord on national policies and providing an excuse for foreign powers. Therefore, this action by the thugs, whether driven by personal vendettas or acting as pawns with hidden backing, is an act against the world's conscience and should not be forgiven by public opinion. The dignitaries at the conference should maintain a calm attitude towards this sudden incident. On one hand, they should investigate the responsibility for the assassination, and on the other hand, continue the proceedings of the conference to prevent the discussion of proposals from being interrupted and to prevent the people's hearts from wavering, while waiting for President Wang's recovery. In addition to our extreme distress, we can only offer this humble contribution, hoping that the authorities will heed it.</p>

<p>Surgery Performed Without Anesthesia</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important official left President Wang's bedside only at 11 o'clock tonight. According to reports, Wang is resting quietly. Surgery was performed this afternoon for two and a half hours without anesthesia, but with injections of Coramine. The injury to the left arm is not serious and can be treated easily, but the other two bullet wounds are more difficult. The bullet that entered the left cheek grazed a bone, causing fragments to fall into the left eye, so the left eye is now inflamed. After preliminary treatment, the doctor decided to wait until the inflammation subsides before performing further surgery tomorrow. The bullet that entered from the back passed between the sixth and seventh ribs, touching both ribs. The bullet is lodged in the flesh, but no internal organs were injured. (A Reuters dispatch dated the 1st)</p>
<p>Six Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Just after 10 o'clock this morning, after the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, when the members were gathered outside the conference hall for a photograph, gunshots suddenly rang out in succession, and President Wang was seen falling to the ground. There was chaos for a moment, and three people were seen holding smoking pistols, attempting to flee in a panic. However, the guards had already gathered and shot the leading assailant. During the commotion, two accomplices fled into the Central Party Headquarters. The building was immediately surrounded by military police. Subsequently, Zhang Xueliang led many people inside to capture them. Zhang himself also seized the weapon from one of them and kicked him to the ground. At the time of the incident, Chairman Chiang was in the auditorium of the Party Headquarters. Upon hearing the gunfire, he rushed out and helped Wang into a car to go to the hospital. Wang was hit by three bullets, one entering from the back and passing through the left rib, one hitting the left cheek, and one hitting the left arm. Blood gushed from his mouth. Shortly after, Chairman Chiang entered the hospital to visit him. Wang was able to speak. Chiang advised him not to speak and to rest quietly. After Wang entered the hospital, doctors performed surgery. According to a certain official who was watching, Wang's injuries are not as serious as initially feared. The motive for the attack has not yet been determined. The leading assailant, surnamed Sun, named Fengming, was also sent to the hospital for surgery. His injuries are said to be quite serious. He is about 20 years old, dressed in a Western suit with an overcoat. The weapon was hidden in the pocket of the overcoat. So far, six suspects have been arrested. The authorities are still searching the entire city for other accomplices. Sun has a Chenguang News Agency in Nanjing. After the incident, the police went to search the agency, but it was empty. The authorities have now taken strict measures to protect the members who have come to Nanjing to attend the meeting. Feng Yuxiang also arrived in Pukou this morning, and was greeted by He Yingqin and others. Only officials were allowed to enter the station at that time. News reporters who wanted to see Feng were refused. When the photograph was taken, the members were divided into five rows. Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Ji, and others were in the front row. The assailant and his accomplices were mingled among the crowd of people near the cameras opposite the members. After the photograph was taken, as the members were about to return to the auditorium, the assailant rushed out of the crowd and shot Wang. Wang fell to the ground. Zhang Ji bravely rushed to the assailant and embraced him tightly from behind, but the assailant still fired seven or eight shots. Zhang Xueliang also rushed to help Zhang and kicked the assailant, who then fell to the ground and his weapon was seized. During the commotion, Wang's guards shot the assailant, and two accomplices took advantage of the chaos to mix into the crowd, but were eventually captured by Zhang Xueliang. Zhang Ji was not injured. In addition to Wang and the assailant, the only other person injured was a servant of the Party Headquarters, who was hit in the leg by a stray bullet and was not seriously injured.

When arrested, he was reporting Wang's assassination over the phone. His clothing was similar to that of a plainclothes detective from the police department.

<p>Original Text of Wang's Speech at the Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of Wang Zhaoming's speech at the Plenary Session is as follows: "Comrades, since the Fifth Plenary Session was held, due to various reasons, the Sixth Plenary Session could only be held today. The number of committee members coming to the capital from various places is unprecedented, which fully demonstrates the fighting spirit of all comrades. This is very gratifying. Following the Sixth Plenary Session is the Fifth National Congress, so the Sixth Plenary Session is the conclusion of the Fourth National Congress and also the beginning of the Fifth National Congress. Therefore, this meeting is of great significance. We remember that when the Fourth National Congress was held, the nation was facing a serious crisis, so the slogan of the Fourth National Congress was 'Sincere Unity to Overcome the National Crisis.' Since the Fourth National Congress, from the First Plenary Session to today, all comrades have been working hard based on the meaning of 'Sincere Unity to Overcome the National Crisis.' We certainly dare not say that our efforts have achieved satisfactory results, but all previous plenary sessions have proceeded according to this direction. Now that the Fifth National Congress is approaching, the national crisis is even more serious than it was at the time of the Fourth National Congress. In the past few years, we have seen the efforts of all comrades, such as the efforts to suppress bandits, which have achieved great results, and other construction projects have also achieved some results. However, these achievements cannot give us satisfactory comfort because the national crisis has not been resolved and has become even more serious. We need to work harder and continue to work according to the direction set by the Fourth National Congress and contribute it to the Fifth National Congress. All kinds of work since the Fifth Plenary Session should be reported in detail at this plenary session, which I will not elaborate on first. Now, at the opening of the meeting, what I can report is that the spirit of sincere unity will never dissipate. Our heartache for the national crisis has increased our unlimited efforts. We are determined to bear this responsibility with unlimited courage and to seek a solution to the national crisis. We hope that based on this spirit and determination, this plenary session will obtain valuable discussions and valuable resolutions to be implemented."

<p>(Geneva) Peace negotiations have reached an impasse. While all parties are prepared to negotiate, they face the difficulty of not knowing where to start. A key figure in the British delegation stated today that although French Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare have met, there is still no hope of a resolution. (1st, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hoare, Eden, and Laval held talks today for an hour and a half. Both the British and French sides described the talks as fruitful. Laval is scheduled to meet with Italian representative Aloisi this afternoon. It is expected that Laval will issue a statement tomorrow regarding the recent talks in Paris, indicating that a solid basis for a resolution has not yet been established. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to a spokesman for the central delegation, Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister Without Portfolio Eden met with French Prime Minister Laval this morning from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. It was immediately decided to request the Sanctions Committee to specify the earliest possible date for the implementation of sanctions. When the Sanctions Committee meets in the afternoon, Laval or Hoare will present a report on the aims and achievements of recent British and French diplomatic activities, explaining that although a compromise has not yet been reached on a solution, the British and French governments have decided to continue their efforts to find such a solution. Experts from the British and French delegations are currently engaged in discussions in Paris to find a basis for negotiations, and will come to Geneva as soon as results are achieved. Representatives from the British and French governments are also scheduled to continue discussions in the afternoon. In addition, Laval will meet with Italian representative Aloisi and Belgian Prime Minister Theunis this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Hoare is scheduled to return to London tomorrow, while Laval is scheduled to leave for Paris tomorrow afternoon or Sunday morning. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare arrived here at 10:00 AM this morning. He met with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval in the morning. Italian government representative Aloisi will not arrive until 4:30 PM this afternoon. Regarding the resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, although there has been some negotiation between Britain and France, there is little hope of a compromise between the two countries. According to the suggestions made by British expert Peterson and French expert Saint-Quentin in Paris, the Italian viewpoint would be given much consideration. However, the British government opposes dividing Abyssinian territory into metropolitan and non-Amharic provinces, placing these provinces under Italian control, and giving Italy a leading role in the implementation of international aid programs in central Abyssinia. League of Nations officials believe that Britain will continue to maintain this stance until before the implementation of sanctions on November 14. On the French side, it is said that French Prime Minister Laval still advocates taking prompt action to mediate the dispute before implementing sanctions, so as not to create unnecessary complications in the already tense situation. However, it is unlikely that a solution to the dispute will be reached in the current meeting of the Sanctions Committee. The Sanctions Committee will decide on the date of implementation of sanctions tomorrow. This date will likely be between November 10 and November 15. The diplomatic representatives of various countries will remain in Geneva for no more than two days. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French representatives here are quite optimistic about the situation, hoping that reconciliation can ultimately be achieved. However, the British representatives do not share this view. They declared today that the Anglo-French talks last week achieved nothing and are not enough to promote peace, and therefore advocate for strict sanctions. (1st, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign ministry spokesman said that Italy does not intend to propose a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute in Geneva, but can study any concessions made by other countries. Anyone who believes that Italy can accept any solution that harms its dignity and interests due to pressure from League of Nations sanctions is greatly mistaken. (31st, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Committee reconvened today to consider reports from member states on their plans regarding Italy. The reports stated that 50 countries have agreed to the proposal to ban arms exports to Italy, 49 countries have agreed to ban financial loans, and 48 countries have agreed to ban Italian imports. After considering the report, the committee decided to reconvene after the Committee of Eighteen determines the date of implementation of sanctions against Italy. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met today to discuss the date for implementing sanctions against Italy. The Committee of Eighteen is now ready to decide on a date to completely boycott Italian goods and prohibit the sale of major products to Italy. It is also reported that after adjourning this Saturday, the Sanctions Committee will reconvene within a month to consider the possibility of withdrawing ambassadors and ministers from various countries and ending travel to Italy as the fourth step in sanctions. The Sanctions Committee will thank the United States for expressing its sympathy for the League of Nations. (31st, National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The various subcommittees dealing with the issue of sanctions against Italy will meet here this morning. It is expected that the implementation of the arms embargo and financial sanctions will not be delayed. However, the subcommittee dealing with contracts and liquidation of contracts has encountered some difficulties. At yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Eighteen, the Romanian representative stated that Italy owed Romania a substantial amount of money and that he could not agree to the date of implementation of sanctions until this problem was resolved. However, a compromise may be reached regarding the issue of Italy's ultimate repayment of the debt. The date of implementation of economic sanctions may be decided today or tomorrow. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Eighteen continued its meeting this afternoon, resolving to entrust the legal and financial committees to study the replies from various countries regarding the arms embargo and financial sanctions. The committees are scheduled to meet tomorrow. The subcommittee then continued to discuss whether the part of pre-existing purchase contracts between various countries and Italy that had not yet been fulfilled should also be subject to sanctions. It was decided that the economic sanctions subcommittee should study the situation in each country separately. (31st, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Indian government today notified the League of Nations that it was willing to support in principle the sanctions against Italy decided by the League of Nations in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. However, the extent to which it can implement such sanctions depends on the extent to which other countries willing to take the same action respect Indian trade and absorb Indian raw materials that have stopped being shipped to Italy. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Dublin The administrative leader of the Irish Free State, de Valera, today introduced a League of Nations obligations bill in the Dáil, stipulating the immediate implementation of sanctions against Italy and assistance to League of Nations member states taking the same action. If this bill is not opposed within 21 days, it will become law. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Egypt today notified the League of Nations that it is willing to abide by the principles of implementing economic and financial sanctions against the Italo-Abyssinian conflict, and will implement the plan resolved by the League of Nations to the extent possible. The League of Nations considers this resolution important because Egypt is the only non-member state that has now fully accepted all sanctions. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italy today began a counteroffensive against the League of Nations sanctions, refusing to renew the reciprocal tariffs on Franco-Italian wines. From this afternoon, all French wines imported into Italy will be subject to full tariffs. Several special trains loaded with raw materials and food are heading into Italy, demonstrating Italy's concern about the sanctions. France is still buying Italian goods, but the government has banned the export of aircraft engines ordered by General Balbo of Italy in September. (31st, National News Agency)</p>

<p>Banning General Trade is Beyond the President's Authority</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration yesterday, advising the American people not to trade with warring nations. This has aroused considerable speculation today. It is unknown whether the nature of this declaration is merely an encouragement to the League of Nations in passing, or a disguised warning, stating that the United States is actually considering legal steps to ban the supply of goods to the people of warring nations. Legal experts here are divided on whether the President has the power to ban general trade. Some experts believe that when the Neutrality Act was passed, Congress only specifically mentioned cotton as being exempt from any ban, so the President can ban the export of other goods. However, some experts say that although the Neutrality Act affects war materials, banning general trade is beyond the President's authority. (31st, National News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) It was learned from reliable sources today that Britain has decided to keep its fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, pending improvement in relations with Italy. It was also learned that French naval experts currently in London are discussing the specific ways in which France would assist Britain in the event of hostilities in the Mediterranean. It is reported here that British Ambassador to Italy Drummond informally told Mussolini that Britain cannot reduce its three-fleet concentration in the Mediterranean until Italian newspapers and radio stations cease their attacks on Britain and until Italian forces in Libya are reduced to normal levels. (31st, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has notified Britain that he cannot recognize Britain's maintenance of its current naval strength in the Mediterranean as a self-defense action. According to authoritative reports, when Mussolini met with British Ambassador to Italy Drummond on Wednesday, the Italian Prime Minister took note of Britain's refusal to reduce its Mediterranean fleet in response to Italy's withdrawal of its troops from Libya. Although Mussolini does not regard Britain's current naval strength as an act of aggression, he told the British Ambassador that Britain's refusal to reduce its troops is an inexplicable anti-Italian action.

<p>(Rome) Pope Pius XI today strongly urged various countries to place Abyssinia under Italian mandate "to avoid a more dangerous war." Prior to this, the Pope had notified the bishops of Rome that the sanctions imposed by the League of Nations have no relation to the Vatican or the monasteries here. All import debts or credits of church institutions are not hindered. It is learned that the Pope's attitude will be detailed in an editorial in the Catholic newspaper "Catholic Culture." The editorial will openly advocate that the League of Nations should immediately place Abyssinia under Italian mandate without further hesitation in order to prevent a more serious conflict in Europe or the world. The reason cited by the newspaper for Italy's mandate over Abyssinia is that after the European War, various countries obtained many German territories, but Italy alone had none. The newspaper will also ask Catholics in Britain and France to strive to understand Italy's needs. Observers also believe that the Pope has now instructed his representative in France, Maglione, to find ways to persuade French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval to do his best to obtain British agreement to this proposal.

<p>(London) The situation in Magale is currently chaotic. According to news from Addis Ababa, Italian troops have occupied the city, but this claim has not been verified in Rome. Italian sources say that the Abyssinian leader Gufsa, who surrendered to Italy, heard that the government had offered a reward of 50,000 Abyssinian dollars for his head. He is now leading his troops to attack Magale. General Gaza, the commander of the Abyssinian army on the northern front, has destroyed all of his property in Magale. At 6:00 AM on Monday, 1,600 men set out to attack the city. No news has been heard since. Rome is now hoping that this force has captured the city. (1st, Reuters)</p>

The Second Army Corps, attacking on the right wing, is reported to have advanced seven miles towards El Aqing on the border with British-Egyptian Sudan. In order to prevent Abyssinian troops from flanking the extreme right on the northern front, Italian troops have now established defenses along the Setit River, using machine guns to await the enemy. The Italian troops attacking Magale on the left wing are also taking the same precautions, building numerous small forts along the watershed to prevent Abyssinian troops from flanking from the Danakil area.

<p>Says the Current Emperor spares No Effort in Instilling Civilization; People are Accustomed to Farming and Animal Husbandry and are Content and Law-Abiding</p>
<p>(Paris) Navy Captain Qigeli, former tutor of Abyssinian Crown Prince Duke Maral, resided in the Abyssinian palace for two years. He recently returned to France due to the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War. Yesterday, he gave a lecture at the "Ambassador Theater" entitled "Two Years in the Abyssinian Palace," detailing palace affairs. The lecture was very engaging. The newly appointed Abyssinian minister, Gaida Huade, also attended the lecture. The captain first described the historical evolution of Abyssinia and the origins of the Solomon dynasty to which the current emperor belongs. He then said that the Abyssinian people are accustomed to farming and animal husbandry, and are known to be content and law-abiding. They cannot be compared with the unruly barbarian tribes in the border areas. The members of the royal family are all amiable and kind, and are very familiar with the captain. "The current emperor is benevolent by nature, generous, and upright. Although he is tall and thin, he is physically strong and very capable of enduring hardship. Since ascending the throne, he has been dedicated to instilling modern civilization and is deeply loved by the people. The empress assists in government affairs, is loyal, diligent, and a good helper to the emperor." As for Crown Prince Maral, who is only thirteen years old, he is gentle in nature and has been educated in the West from a young age. Although he is still young, he can speak very accurate French. He plans to apply to the French Saint-Cyr Military Academy in the future to seek further education. When Captain Qigeli returned home, the prince personally went to the station to bid him farewell with tears in his eyes. There was great reluctance between the teacher and student. The captain comforted him and told him that he would return soon to continue teaching him so that he could enter the Saint-Cyr Military Academy. Hearing this, the prince smiled through his tears.

<p>(Fuzhou) The three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi have agreed on a detailed plan to jointly encircle and suppress the remaining bandits on the border, and will launch a large-scale encirclement. The armies have advanced to appropriate locations and are awaiting orders for a general offensive. Xie Zuolin, Fan Tiemin, and other bandit groups in eastern Fujian have been driven by our army into Nanyang Mountain and other places in the border area between Fuding and Shouning, and our bandit suppression troops have established close contact. It is determined that the bandits will have difficulty breaking through the encirclement and escaping. According to captured bandits, the bandits are suffering from a severe shortage of food after being surrounded. Even if the government troops do not advance to suppress them, they will perish on their own. Currently, the bandits are planning to use all their strength to break through the blockade line and flee to northern Fujian. Our military authorities have made strict preparations. After the 9th Division's supplementary regiment and the 50th regiment arrive, the forward troops will intensify their attacks on the bandit areas. The day when the remaining bandits in eastern Fujian are cleared will not be far off. (A dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 1st)</p>

<p>— Edited by Yu Qing-tang of the China Social Education Society — Yu Qing-tang</p>
<p>The severity of China's rural problems and the hardship of farmers' lives have now reached their extreme. Who is not alarmed by the fact that years of droughts and floods have wiped out the lives and property of so many people; the recent Yellow River disaster has left more than 300,000 victims in western Shandong homeless, and more than one million victims in northern Jiangsu are drifting and waiting to die? Who does not know that during times of disaster, there is naturally no harvest, and even in good years, the dumping of foreign agricultural products causes the prices of domestic agricultural products to fall below the cost? And who has not heard of the gradual decrease in cultivated land, the rapid increase in poor and tenant farmers, the destruction of rural handicrafts, and the decline of national new industries, making it impossible for healthy farmers to use their labor? More than 300 million poor and helpless farmers are living inhuman, oppressed lives under the threat of the world economy and the shackles of old production relations!</p>
<p>How to cope with the threat of the world economic system without being hit by it, and how to transform the old production relations and be liberated from its shackles, so that farmers can first recuperate and then freely develop their productive forces and live a rational social life? This is the real issue of the current rural problem.</p>
<p>The purpose of this column is to: (1) provide the actual situation of rural areas in various provinces and regions, and depict the real suffering of the rural people; (2) dissect the role and influence of foreign economic forces in rural areas; (3) analyze and compare the latest rural economic statistical materials to show the real situation of rural decline; (4) introduce farmers' opinions on their own joys and sorrows in life and on the current situation; (5) introduce theories on improving rural life at home and abroad, as well as successful experimental undertakings. If these materials can arouse our vigilance, thinking, verification, and research, and enable the rural problem to have a reasonable solution, then this small column will have fulfilled its possible task.</p>
<p>The drafts published in this column pay special attention to the following standards: First, the content is original, the length is not very long, but it is a perspective and writing of folk life, not any existing material without thinking. Second, the text is interesting, lively and lively. Third, the realism must be timely, such as the recent attacks on rural areas by disasters and soldiers, and we will do our best to introduce them to arouse everyone's enthusiasm and efforts for relief. Fourth, the materials should be representative in terms of geographic area, and should be as comprehensive as possible, without being limited to any corner of the country.</p>
<p>We sincerely contribute this column to the readers, hoping that our vast readership, especially those who live in rural areas and those who are engaged in practical rural work, can regularly provide us with valuable materials. The gradual creation of public opinion; the gradual accumulation of objective materials: the gradual clarification of the real nature of rural problems; from the disclosure of practical work to the discussion and resolution of problems: all of this depends on the collective strength of the people of the whole country, and it is what we deeply expect.</p>
<h3 id="e37">A Few Opinions on the Land Rent Problem <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Liang</p>
<p>In recent years, China's rural areas have been in constant turmoil. There are many reasons for this, but the land rent problem is indeed a major one. Therefore, if we want to stabilize the rural areas, in addition to abolishing the private ownership of land and fundamentally abolishing land rent, we must at least find a proper solution to the land rent problem before it can be effective. Otherwise, even if we try to maintain stability for the time being, it will be difficult to avoid long-term turmoil. I am not talented, but I would like to contribute some opinions on the land rent rate in the "Rural Life" section for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>The high land rent in China, whether in kind or in cash, is very obvious; for example, rent in kind often accounts for more than 50% of the output, and rent in cash often accounts for more than 10% of the land price. Therefore, China's "purchase year" is shorter than that of other countries. Therefore, some people say that China's land rent is not only land rent, but also includes a part of agricultural dividends and even a part of wages. Because the land rent is too high, tenant farmers cannot afford it, so there has been a rent reduction movement in recent years. For example, the "25% Rent Reduction Method" proposed by the Kuomintang in the 15th year of the Republic of China is one example. This method is to reduce 25% of the original rent amount, regardless of the amount of the original rent, so it is called "25% Rent Reduction." However, since this rent reduction method was proposed, it has only been implemented once in Zhejiang Province, and has not been effectively implemented in other regions. Even if it has been implemented occasionally, it has only caused disputes, leading to a rent reduction movement that is nominal rather than real, or a rent reduction movement that disrupts the rural areas. The reason for this is that, in addition to landlords opposing rent reduction and the government not effectively enforcing the law, there are also problems with the "25% Rent Reduction" itself. First, the meaning of "25% Rent Reduction" is unclear. Some people interpret it as first deducting 25% from the total harvest of agricultural crops as compensation for the capital invested by the tenant farmer (all by-products belong to the tenant farmer), and the remaining 75% is divided equally between the landlord and the tenant farmer, that is, each gets 37.5%. In other words, the landlord gets 37.5% and the tenant farmer gets 62.5%. This is the meaning of deducting 25% from the total amount of production. Others interpret it as first dividing the harvest equally, that is, the landlord and tenant each get half, and then deducting 25% from the rent paid by the tenant to the landlord. In this way, the landlord only gets 25% and the tenant farmer can get 75%. This is the so-called deducting 25% from the rent agreement or deducting 25% from the agreed rent amount. Since there are two different interpretations of "25% Rent Reduction," if the landlord's income was originally above 50%, he will definitely agree with the first interpretation and adopt the former method of rent reduction, while the tenant farmer will agree with the second interpretation and adopt the latter method of rent reduction. Conversely, if the landlord's income was originally below 50%, he will agree with the second interpretation and adopt the latter method of rent reduction, while the tenant farmer will inevitably agree with the first interpretation and adopt the former method of rent reduction. Because of the different interpretations, many disputes arise between landlords and tenants, and as a result, "25% Rent Reduction" becomes even more difficult to implement. Second, even if there are no interpretive disputes in "25% Rent Reduction," and no disputes arise between landlords and tenants, and the "25% Rent Reduction" method is implemented, unfair phenomena will inevitably occur for both landlords and tenants due to the different grades of land and the different yields. For example, after various counties in Zhejiang implemented the 25% rent reduction standard (with 37.5% as the rent amount), the income of tenant farmers and landlords was still not balanced, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p>Total Harvest per Mu Tenant Farmer's Income Production Cost Tenant Farmer's Net Income Landlord's Income Taxes Paid by Landlord Landlord's Net Income</p>
<p>3 Shi 18.75 yuan 6.00 yuan 12.75 yuan 11.15 yuan 1.00 yuan 10.25 yuan</p>
<p>2 Shi 5 Dou 15.63 yuan 6.00 yuan 9.63 yuan 9.37 yuan 1.00 yuan 8.37 yuan</p>
<p>2 Shi 13.50 yuan 6.00 yuan 7.50 yuan 7.50 yuan 1.00 yuan 6.50 yuan</p>
<p>1 Shi 5 Dou 9.38 yuan 6.00 yuan 3.38 yuan 5.62 yuan 1.00 yuan 4.62 yuan</p>
<p>1 Shi 6.15 yuan 6.00 yuan 0.15 yuan 3.75 yuan 1.00 yuan 2.75 yuan</p>
<p>5 Dou 3.13 yuan 6.00 yuan -2.87 yuan 1.87 yuan 1.00 yuan 0.87 yuan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that after the implementation of "25% Rent Reduction," the net income of tenant farmers who harvest more than 2 Shi per mu is slightly more than that of landlords; for those who harvest 2 Shi per mu, the net income of landlords and tenants is equal; if the harvest is less than 2 Shi per mu, the net income of tenant farmers is far less than that of landlords, and they may even lose money. This is a very obvious display of unfairness, which is also a major reason why disputes cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Since "25% Rent Reduction" has many obstacles and difficulties, the evolution of "25% Rent Reduction" has also led to the method of stipulating the highest rent amount in order to protect tenant farmers. For example, Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Amending the 25% Rent Reduction in Zhejiang Province states: "After the promulgation of these Measures, for all newly established tenancy contracts, the rent payment amount shall be based on 37.5% of the total harvest of the normal annual production of the land, and all by-products shall belong to the tenant farmer." The National Government's Land Law Article 177 later promulgated also stipulated: "Land rent shall not exceed 375 per thousand of the total harvest of normal agricultural products. If the agreed land rent exceeds 375 per thousand, it shall be reduced to 375 per thousand. If it is less than 375 per thousand, it shall be based on the agreement." This is roughly the same, meaning to limit the highest rent amount. Although this provision can remedy the shortcomings of "25% Rent Reduction" (such as reducing 25% from the original rent amount across the board, the original high rent amount is still high, and the original low rent amount is too low, which is not fair), it also has inappropriate points. Because land rent has differential rent (Ricardo) and absolute rent (Marx): the former is caused by the difference in land productivity, and land rent will naturally not be equal; the latter is generated by the private ownership of land, and under the private ownership of land, land rent has no difference. Since the legislative intention of the Land Law is to protect tenant farmers, its provision that the highest rent amount shall not exceed 375 per thousand can only protect wealthy tenant farmers who cultivate fertile land; while poor tenant farmers who cultivate barren land often cannot enjoy the benefits of legal protection. Because the level of land rent in China does not necessarily follow the fertility of the land, in fact, the rent rate of high-grade land is often lower than the rent rate of low-grade land. If the Land Law is implemented, the rent reduction for fertile land will be more, and the rent reduction for barren land will be less. According to recent surveys, poor tenant farmers mostly cultivate barren land. Therefore, the legal benefits stipulated by the Land Law are still not enjoyed fairly.</p>
<p>Another level is that if the provisions of the Land Law are to reduce and exempt the exploitation from the private ownership of land, then poor tenant farmers who cultivate barren land should be even more protected and should have their rent reduced. Because there is very little room for differential rent for those who cultivate barren land, and the land rent they pay is almost entirely the result of their blood and sweat. Under the private ownership system of land, even if it cannot be absolutely abolished, it should at least be reduced to the minimum limit to be fair. However, according to the provisions of the Land Law, this point has no effect, and it is no wonder that it is dissatisfied by the general scholars.</p>
<p>In addition, the Land Law stipulates that the highest rent amount shall not exceed 375 per thousand, which is sometimes enough to hinder the development of land productivity. Because the rent amount cannot exceed 375 per thousand, the landlord will naturally be unwilling to invest more capital to improve the land, and the tenant farmer is limited by his financial resources. As a result, land productivity will inevitably be restricted.</p>
<p>Based on the above simple description, since "25% Rent Reduction" has many obstacles and difficulties, and the provisions of the Land Law are mostly dissatisfied by scholars, then how should appropriate rent rates be stipulated under the current land private ownership system in China? The author believes that the strengths of "25% Rent Reduction" and the Land Law should be adopted. First, the land administration agency or other agencies should divide the land into three grades (or more), and then stipulate the highest rent amount separately according to the grades of land. The tenant farmer will pay the land rent according to the rent rate of each grade of land, and the landlord shall not collect land rent exceeding the rent rate of each grade of land. After that, if the landlord is willing to invest in improving the land, the grade of the land will change, and the rent rate can also be increased accordingly. Conversely, if the land reduces its productivity due to force majeure, the tenant farmer can also apply to the land administration agency or other agencies to lower the grade of the land and reduce the rent rate. For example:</p>
<p>The highest rent amount for high-grade land shall not exceed 375 per thousand of the total harvest of normal agricultural products; if it is less than this amount, it shall be based on the agreement.</p>
<p>The highest rent amount for medium-grade land shall not exceed 350 per thousand of the total harvest of normal agricultural products; if it is less than this amount, it shall be based on the agreement.</p>
<p>The highest rent amount for low-grade land shall not exceed 300 per thousand of the total harvest of normal agricultural products; if it is less than this amount, it shall be based on the agreement.</p>
<p>If there are more grades of land, the highest rent amount will also be subdivided accordingly. According to this provision, the highest rent amount can prevent landlords from collecting excessive land rent, and the highest rent amount is also differential, which is determined according to the difference in land productivity. It can take into account various tenant farmers and various land productivity, and it is much more appropriate than the provisions of the Land Law. At a time when land rent is excessively high and tenant farmers are extremely poor, it is worthy of attention by friends who are improving rural life.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued a decree on the 1st. The Judicial Yuan presented a report from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which in turn received reports from the chief prosecutors of the high courts of Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangxi provinces. The reports concerned prisoners: Luo Zhao-shi, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in August of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) for premeditated murder; Wei Zhi-gao, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and robbery; Xu Xiao-he, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder; and Xu Cai-yun, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) for premeditated murder. However, it was found that the age of each of the offenders at the time of the crime was under eighteen years old. According to Article 5 of the New Criminal Law Implementation Act, a request was made to grant a reduced sentence. Now, in accordance with Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, it is declared that the life sentence originally imposed on the offender Wei Zhi-gao is reduced to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve years. The life sentences originally imposed on the three offenders Luo Zhao-shi, Xu Xiao-he, and Xu Cai-yun are each reduced to a fixed term of imprisonment of ten years, in order to show compassion. This decree is issued. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Relief Association telegraphed the National Economic Commission, stating that the breaches in Shandong Province had brought disaster to northern Jiangsu. Even now, while other provinces have passed the worst period, the people of Jiangsu continue to suffer an even more dire situation. Despite various efforts to relieve the crisis, the breaches upstream have not been closed, and the water flows downward. For the Huaihai region of Jiangsu Province, it is no different than holding a container under an axe's downward swing. Contemplating the future, one cannot help but feel fear and dread. Moreover, several months have passed since the river breaches occurred. The association has repeatedly telegraphed the commission, earnestly requesting that orders be given to expedite the closure of the breaches. The commission has duly relayed the orders. Now that the time of frost and receding water has arrived, there has been no news of construction beginning. If days continue to be wasted and delayed, it is sincerely feared that the work will not be completed before the peach blossoms flood again. It seems inevitable that the entire northern Jiangsu will be plunged into a state of submersion. With compassion for these disaster-stricken people, as if feeling their pain oneself, it is earnestly requested that a strict order be issued to urge and set a deadline for the start of construction to close the breaches and alleviate the crisis in Jiangsu.

<h3 id="e61">Beining Railway Bureau Constructs Yuguan Station <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Simultaneous Construction of General Bureau Official Residences Makes Inter-Railway Transport Inside and Outside the Pass Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Dalian Communication: The Beining Railway Bureau has recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for approval to undertake two major construction projects. One is the renovation of the Shanhaiguan Station, and the other is the construction of additional official residences for the Tianjin General Bureau. Since the implementation of through train services inside and outside the Pass and the borrowing of Shanhaiguan Station by the puppet Fengshan Railway as its terminal, the local switches, ticket offices, telegraph offices, and telephone rooms have all felt cramped. Every time vehicles are exchanged or passengers transfer trains, the small size of the platform makes it extremely crowded. In addition to parking trains, there are almost no exchange tracks in the various switches. Zhu previously planned to spend money under the name of the puppet Fengshan Railway to build a new Shanhaiguan Station. The Beining Railway Bureau, however, believed that Shanhaiguan was under the jurisdiction of the bureau and that the puppet Fengshan Railway was merely borrowing the station for parking purposes. It absolutely would not allow it to usurp the role of the host. Therefore, the Engineering and Transportation Departments planned to allocate 300,000 yuan from the bureau's income to first expand essential works such as switches, bridges, dry bridges, ticket offices, and platforms. The request to the Ministry of Railways for approval to build was submitted last week. The bureau's engineers are designing, gathering labor and materials within this year, and starting construction in early spring next year. As for the second phase of construction, such as road signs and water towers, it will be started when income is slightly more abundant next year. In Tianjin, the office of the Railway Bureau's official residence, due to the increasing number of personnel and the increase in staff in various departments, is quite cramped. The most important departments of the bureau, such as the Engineering and Mechanical Departments, are located outside the bureau, and communication is often inconvenient. There is a piece of land west of the general bureau address. In addition to allocating a corner for the bureau's hospital and building a large building recently, there is still much vacant land. Therefore, the bureau specifically requested the Ministry of Railways to allow the allocation of 300,000 yuan from the road's revenue to build a new official residence. The new house is slightly larger than the old official residence, and the vaults are built in the basement. Construction has begun and is expected to be completed in June or July next year. In the future, the new and old bureaus will be connected as one, and the director's office, the General Affairs Office, and the Accounting Department will be moved in. The Engineering and Mechanical Departments will then move into the old official residence.</p>
<p>The matter of inter-railway transport between the Beining Railway and outside the Pass was previously rumored to be discussed in Beiping. According to a person in charge of the Beining Railway Bureau, the proposal for this matter was made by Yin Tongfu at the International Transport Conference convened in Tokyo, Japan, this spring. At that time, the Japanese side made some suggestions, but they were not included in the formal agenda. Later, although the Eastern Travel Agency convened a meeting between the parties concerned, due to the different freight rates inside and outside the Pass and the different levels of tariffs, both parties adopted a strict inspection policy for inbound and outbound goods. In fact, it is difficult to achieve inter-railway transport. Recently, Manchukuo Railway dispatched Director Ishimoto Kenji to be stationed in Tianjin, who also mentioned this matter. However, because there are still difficulties, it was shelved before formal consultation. Therefore, the rumors that the Beining Railway Bureau sent representatives, the manager of the Eastern Travel Agency Zhang Shuihong, and the Manchukuo Railway representative Ishimoto to discuss in Beiping are all untrue. As for the business situation of the Beining Railway Bureau this year, as of now, it is not good. It has decreased by more than half compared to last year. This is due to the small number of passengers and the stagnation of freight transport to Australia. Among them, the slow sales of Kailuan coal have had the greatest impact on the road's revenue. Recently, Kailuan, in order to dump its coal, discussed with the Railway Bureau a method of reducing freight rates, which will be implemented soon. The fee reduction contract will be cancelled and the original contract will be restored if Kailuan's business is prosperous and the coal sales reach a considerable number.</p>

<p>Hang News: Of the four major bandit leaders who have been harassing southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian, after Liu Hannan (i.e., Su Yu) and Zhang Yunlong were killed, a large number of bandits have been captured. The remaining bandits who escaped were led by Huang Fuwu and Liu Ying and fled south together. They were besieged by the bandit suppression army between Longqing and Jingtai. Except for a small number who broke through the encirclement and fled back to northern Fujian, the rest have broken into small groups and fled in all directions. The Zhejiang Security Regiment, together with the local people's self-defense force, searched for the scattered bandits in different directions. The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from Xuan Tiewu, the Director of the Security Department, yesterday stating that at 6:00 p.m. on October 30, the People's Self-Defense Force of Xutou Township, Suichang County, accidentally captured one of the four major bandit leaders, Huang Fuwu, and several accomplices while searching for the remaining bandits in Mantouling. When Huang was arrested, he was disguised as a poor peasant. More than 1,000 yuan in cash was found in his ragged clothes, and his accomplices confirmed that he was Huang Fuwu without mistake. A team was sent to escort him to the headquarters of the 14th Division in Suichang City. After a brief interrogation by Division Commander Huo Kuizhang, he reported to the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Four Provincial Border Areas and telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. He will be executed on the spot to satisfy public sentiment. In addition, after the bandit leaders Liu Hannan and Zhang Yunlong were killed by the 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the Zhejiang Security Team in Longquan a month ago, their bodies were photographed and buried in Longquan City. All officers and soldiers who participated in this battle have been presented to the Acting Headquarters for awards as usual. (November 1)</p>

<p>At about 1:00 a.m. on the 30th, seven or eight robbers suddenly came to the Wang Zhengtai rice shop in the southern market of Xinchang Town, Seventh District. They used a stone bar about two feet long and weighing more than 100 jin (a Chinese unit of weight) to break through the row door. Several robbers stood guard outside, and several robbers went directly into the bedroom of the shop owner Wang Shuzi, each holding a pistol, and forced him to open the iron box. They robbed 1,967 yuan in banknotes, 106 silver dollars, 34 double coppers, a pair of gold rings, a new brand of No. 1027 rifle, a bayonet, and a 300-yuan promissory note from Zao Ye. There were also two title deeds, totaling about 3,000 yuan. At that time, it happened to be the time for the town's business district patrol team to be on duty, so the robbers escaped westward without any obstruction.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Incoming Correspondence: A Humble Opinion on Salt Administration Reform (Continued) <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Li Youyi</p>
<p>(B) Allow people to freely buy and sell without regional restrictions. If merchants are unwilling to transport to remote areas, there is a risk of salt shortage. (C) Currently, salt tax revenue ranks second in central government income, which is crucial to finance. Once the monopoly merchants are abolished, the entire tax revenue will be reduced to scattered amounts, which is feared to be unreliable. (D) Monopoly merchants are rich in capital. When the country is in urgent need, they can pre-collect future tax payments at any time or provide loans. Private merchants with limited capital cannot do this. For the above reasons, although the Central Salt Administration Reform Committee has been established for several years, it has not made any active and concrete progress. Only in a passive aspect, in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the central and regional salt affairs administrative organs were all merged into the Salt Revenue Audit Bureau and the provincial branches, slightly reducing administrative expenses. However, the monopoly rights of salt merchants remain the same. The lives of salt farmers are difficult, and farmers and poor laborers still eat high-priced salt. Abandoning the fundamentals and focusing on the trivial is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, after the Salt Revenue Audit Bureau took over the salt affairs administration and management of anti-smuggling, the unified authority should be able to invigorate and benefit the country. However, a closer look at its achievements inevitably leads to disappointment. Those who govern salt affairs should adhere to the principle of preventing smuggling, facilitating sales, and increasing tax revenue. If the number of salt sales is ignored and the tax rate is simply increased to increase revenue, it is a bad policy. My country's salt tax in the late Qing Dynasty was only tens of millions of yuan per year. By the time of the Republic of China, the central government actively reorganized it, and the annual revenue gradually increased. Around the tenth year of the Republic (1921), it was about one hundred million yuan. After the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic (1927-1928), it increased to one hundred million several tens of thousands of yuan. In recent years, there have been even more increases, leaping forward. It cannot be said that the tax revenue is not huge. However, if we look at the amount of salt released over the years, compared with the past ten years, it has mostly been between 3.67 million to 3.8 million "dan", with a difference of no more than one or two hundred thousand "dan". The number of salt released does not increase sharply with the prosperity of tax revenue, so it is clear that the increase in tax revenue is not due to salt sales. Since the Republic of China, additional taxes have been common, such as the central government's additional military purchase, post-war military expenses, and local additional provincial treasury surcharges, continuous provincial treasury surcharges, provincial public debt surcharges, and education expenses (there may be more that cannot be listed in detail). In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the additional taxes of each province were uniformly collected by the central government. After the Salt Revenue Audit Bureau took over the salt affairs administration, the Sima scale for measuring salt catties was changed to the market scale (the market scale is about 70-80% of the Sima scale, that is, each "dan" of salt was 100 catties in the past, but now it is only 70-80 catties). Reducing the weight without reducing the tax means that the tax rate has invisibly increased by 20-30%. No wonder the tax revenue has been more prosperous in recent years. However, this is like drinking poison to quench thirst, only caring about the present. Such a policy will lead to more smuggling, and the harms are countless. Aren't the two salt yards in Liangzhe, Yu and Dai, facing the problem of manufacturers stopping the purchase of salt catties due to the sluggish sales of official salt? If official sales are sluggish, private sales will be prosperous. This is an undeniable truth. It is also heard that smugglers are very active in the Pudong area of Shanghai, which further proves the increase in smuggling. I fear that in a few years, the more the tax increases, the more sluggish the sales will be. The tax revenue may temporarily increase, but the amount of salt released will decrease day by day. Driving all the poor people in the country to eat smuggled salt will also make the tax source unsustainable. This is a deep concern, and the government cannot but take it into account. However, it is difficult to change the accumulated malpractices of hundreds of years overnight. Only by gradually rectifying and improving can we achieve perfection. I used to work in salt administration in the Song District for six years. When Zou Yulin was the head of the Salt Office, he ordered each district to compile the first chapter of the salt administration history, and I was the main writer for the Song District. I personally experienced the salt-producing areas and witnessed the plight of salt farmers. I often lamented that salt farmers and salt merchants are both people in the salt industry. Why are their hardships and joys so different? Now that the government is striving for reform, aiming to benefit the country and the people, based on the experience I have gained over the years, within the scope of my limited knowledge, I have slightly considered the new salt law and prepared the following preliminary reform opinions: (1) Increase the purchase price of salt to help salt farmers and prevent private sales. Most of the edible salt produced in our country is in the coastal areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, and the three northeastern provinces. The people are poor and fierce, and the land is eroded by the tide and cannot be cultivated. They rely entirely on extracting brine to make salt to make a living. However, the prices at which salt merchants purchase salt catties from salt farmers in various places are very low. Even in Liangzhe, where the cost is relatively high, each "dan" is only one or two yuan. In other areas, it is as low as two or three jiao. Compared with the selling price of salt by merchants, the difference is very large. Some harsh manufacturers even suppress the weight when weighing it into the factory warehouse. Salt farmers cannot bear the hardship. Smugglers take the opportunity to purchase at a higher price, steal and make profits. Salt farmers are forced by livelihood. Knowing that it is illegal, they are happy to sell smuggled salt, which makes smuggled salt flood the country. Try to calculate carefully, and the annual private sales should be an alarming number (this calculation will be detailed later). Furthermore, the salt farmers themselves are all countless ignorant people. If the purchase price is too low, they have no choice but to sell smuggled salt in the hope of getting a good price. This is what the timid do. The fierce ones even follow the smugglers and transport salt with weapons, eventually becoming bandits and disrupting the local area. This is unavoidable. Modern pirates in our country, such as Mao, are related to this. The harm is not only in the salt administration. We must seek remedies urgently and cannot delay. The government should quickly investigate the living conditions of salt farmers in various regions and increase the purchase price of salt, so that the coastal people can have sufficient food and clothing and not be tempted by smugglers. We will see that the harm of smuggled salt will be eliminated without enforcement. Then teach them to improve salt production so that the salt is clean and hygienic. This is the most important fundamental measure (the salt produced in our country, except for well and pool salt, is slightly better in the Zhejiang, Fujian, and Song districts. The salt in Huai and Lu contains a lot of mud and impurities, which hinders hygiene when eaten). (To be continued)</p>

<p>Lenient Treatment for Those Who Register Voluntarily</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Smoker Registration Section began handling the registration of all smokers in Shanghai on July 1st and ended on October 31st, with a total of over 23,000 registered smokers. Yesterday was the start of the compulsory registration period. In order to be considerate of smokers, the bureau will exempt those who voluntarily go to register from punishment. At the same time, the police will arrest smokers and send them to the South City General Bureau or various branch bureaus for registration, also exempting them from punishment. However, from today onwards, in addition to lenient treatment for those who voluntarily go to the bureau to register and no punishment will be imposed, those who are arrested will be dealt with in accordance with the law, either with a fine or a prison sentence. According to news from the section yesterday, approximately 2,000 smokers were registered in the North and South Cities on yesterday alone.</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, as compulsory registration begins, the Municipal Public Security Bureau should strictly investigate and arrest unregistered smokers. Starting yesterday, in addition to ordering the police from various branch bureaus to pay attention to detaining and sending smokers to the General Bureau for interrogation, it has also specially dispatched investigators from the sections and a police platoon to conduct investigations separately. Personnel have also been dispatched to the remaining water and land transportation docks to conduct regular inspections. Many smokers have been arrested. Yesterday, more than 70 smokers were sent to the General Bureau by various branch bureaus. Since there was no record, the bureau ordered all the smokers sent to be interrogated and sent for drug detoxification immediately upon arrival. The work is very intense.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Nanjing Road Merchants' Association Continues to Oppose Telephone Rate Increase <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to the Public Works Department Yesterday Reaffirming Previous Resolutions; Another Meeting Today to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Although the city's various public groups have strongly protested the telephone rate increase proposal, there has been no positive news. In order to redouble their efforts and express their opposition, the Nanjing Road Merchants' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting that the report of the four experts not be approved. It is also concentrating its efforts and will convene a meeting of all members today to discuss countermeasures. The China East News Agency reporter has investigated and filed the following report:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting: According to Zhao Tingyu, the person in charge of the Nanjing Road Merchants' Association, the association has repeatedly argued against the telephone company's rate increase. During the review by the expert committee, it also sent two letters stating the reasons why the rate should not be increased, urging them to pay attention. The report submitted by the experts has been seen in the newspapers, and it still does not take into account the current economic and commercial situation and the public interest. Instead, it rashly proposed a rate increase plan, and its calculations are flawed. If the cost of each call is three cents, then stores should be entitled to at least 300 calls per month for the ten yuan they spend. Therefore, the matter was discussed at a meeting yesterday, and it was resolved to send a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting them to seriously consider it and not approve it, in order to benefit business and reassure the public.</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department: The association's letter to the Public Works Department yesterday stated: "We are writing to you because our association has repeatedly argued against the Shanghai Telephone Company's telephone rate increase and has submitted the reasons why the rate should not be increased one by one, hoping that the expert committee would adopt them and make a fair resolution. However, we recently read the summary of the report submitted by the telephone experts to your bureau in the Chinese newspapers. All members of our association have studied it carefully and feel that it overemphasizes the excessive praise of the company, which is used as a basis for prioritizing the company's interests. Although it mentions the company's excessive consumption and salaries, it is nothing more than a smokescreen. It does not take into account the public users' ability to pay or their interests. Lowering the basic telephone fee slightly is pleasing to the ear, but the basic number of calls is reduced as much as possible, which is actually more costly. Even smart children will not be fooled, let alone users. The price of extra calls is too high, and large stores with a large scope of business will naturally have busy calls. Charging them all will be even more unfair. According to a gentleman who recently returned from London, the London Telephone Company reduced the quarterly fee from one pound twelve shillings and six pence to one pound six shillings due to the shared feeling of economic downturn. The fees in various places, which were previously one pound seven shillings and six pence, have been reduced to one pound. The prices for group business and business are also considerably lower, averaging 30% off. London has a high cost of living, but it still reduces telephone fees, while Shanghai has a low cost of living but increases telephone fees. This reason is difficult to understand. In short, Shanghai is now facing economic difficulties and a declining market. No matter what clever method the telephone company uses to increase rates, the city's users simply do not want to bear it. Please, bureau, consider the public interest carefully and do not approve it. In this way, the citizens' hard-earned money, which they use to fulfill their tax obligations, will still have some rights that they can rely on your bureau to protect, which will not be in vain."</p>
<p>Another Meeting Today: The association believes that the telephone company's move is truly inappropriate. Although the four experts know that there are reasons to increase rates, they absolutely do not ask whether citizens have the ability to pay the extra fees. Although it has sent letters to the Public Works Department and the Taxpayers' Association again, it has not seen any results so far. For the sake of caution, it will convene a meeting of all members again at 4:00 PM today to discuss further countermeasures in order to achieve the goal as soon as possible. It is also known that members of the association have already put forward new opinions, which will be discussed in detail at today's meeting.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, various rumors have been circulating in the city recently, causing residents to have doubts. In order to clarify the truth, our reporter went to the Municipal Government to meet with Secretary-General Yu.

The government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate strictly and arrest those who spread rumors and confuse the public. At the same time, he hopes that citizens will not believe rumors and disturb each other.</p>

<h3 id="e75">He Bingxian Discusses Foreign Trade in the First Half of This Year <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Trade Values, Both Exports and Imports, Showed a Decline; Imports of Staple Foods Increased</p>
<p>He Bingxian, Director of the Bureau of International Trade, in order to explain the decline in China's total trade value for the first half of this year, the nature of the decline, the trade balance, the state of gold and silver movements, the rise and fall of major import and export commodities, and the changes in trade by country and port, yesterday released the following statement analyzing China's foreign trade:</p>
<p>Trade Values: Observing trade values, since 1932, China's foreign trade has experienced a sharp decline. The total value of foreign trade in 1932 decreased by 4% compared to 1931, 1933 decreased by 9% compared to 1932, and 1934 decreased by 3% compared to 1933. Up to the first half of this year, although China's foreign trade has not reversed the previous decline with an increase, the degree of the decline this year has slightly eased. The total value of China's foreign trade in the first half of this year was 804,824,968 yuan, a decrease of only 4% compared to the same period in 1934. Analyzing import and export trade, the export trade volume in the first half of this year was 259,369,673 yuan, a decrease of 3.42% compared to the same period last year, and the import trade volume was 545,455,295 yuan, a decrease of 4.6% compared to the same period last year. The decline in the value of China's import trade in the first half of this year was partly due to the decline in import prices and partly due to the decrease in import volume.</p>
<p>Trade Balance: In the first half of this year, China's import surplus totaled 286,085,622 yuan, a decrease of more than 15,219,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. During China's extreme currency contraction, the decrease in the import surplus is not unwelcome. However, we should note that the decrease in the import surplus is not due to an increase in export volume, but only because the rate of decline in import volume is higher than the rate of decline in export volume. In the first ten days of this year, the percentage of the import surplus in the total import value was still 52.45, which is no different from 52.87 in the same period last year. The movement of gold and silver is closely related to the trade balance. In the first half of this year, due to the government's restrictions on the export of silver and encouragement of silver imports, silver turned from a net export to a net import. In terms of gold and gold coins, there was also a net export this year. Generally, the net export of gold and silver accounted for about 7% of China's commodity import surplus in the first half of this year. From this, it can be seen that in the first half of this year, China's hard currency only offset a very small part of the commodity import surplus, and most of the commodity import surplus still needs to rely on invisible income or be offset in the next period.</p>
<p>Trade Nature: Observing from the nature of commodity trade, the distribution of China's import and export commodities in the first half of this year has changed significantly compared to last year. On the export side, due to the sharp decline in textile products, the percentage of manufactured goods has decreased. As a result, raw materials and semi-finished products have jumped to first place, manufactured goods have retreated to second place, and food, beverages, and tobacco remain in third place. On the import side, there have also been changes. Manufactured goods rank first, the import of rice and grains has increased sharply, so food, beverages, and tobacco have advanced to second, and raw materials and semi-finished products have retreated to third. If the value of various commodities in the first half of this year is compared with the same period last year, on the export side, raw materials and semi-finished products increased by 15% compared to the first half of last year, food, beverages, and tobacco also increased by 4%, while manufactured goods decreased by 23%. In addition, miscellaneous goods also decreased by more than 8%. On the import side, valued in gold units, food, beverages, and tobacco increased by 34%, manufactured goods increased by more than 7%, and miscellaneous goods increased by 25%, while raw materials and semi-finished products decreased by more than 8%.</p>
<p>Import Commodities: In the first half of this year, the total value of China's imported foreign goods, valued in national currency, was 545,455,000 yuan, a decrease of 4.28% compared to 569,849,000 yuan in the same period last year. Among the various imported commodities, rice and grains had the largest value, followed by metals, and then cotton, timber, kerosene, dyes, pigments, chemical products, and pharmaceuticals. Sugar and paper each were valued at more than 10 million gold units. In addition, cotton cloth, vehicles, gasoline, wool fabrics, diesel, fish, seafood were each valued at between 5 million and 10 million gold units.</p>
<p>Export Commodities: Last year, China's exported commodities were mostly hides and furs. This year, tung oil jumped to first place, followed by metal ores, and then hides and furs. In addition, preserved eggs and egg products, tea, and peanuts were each valued at more than 10 million yuan. Raw silk, cotton yarn, wool, drawnwork and embroidery, silk fabrics, and pig bristles were each between 5 million and 10 million yuan. Other important export commodities included sausage casings, cotton, medicinal herbs, spices, livestock, fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and coal, all around several million yuan. Those with decreases rather than increases included tea, medicinal materials, spices, fruits, vegetables, straw hats and straw hat braids, pig bristles, mats, and eggs and egg products. Generally, among China's exported commodities in the first half of this year, those with decreases were more numerous than those with increases.</p>
<p>Trade by Country: Regarding the increase or decrease in China's trade with various countries in the first half of this year, exports increased significantly to Italy, Germany, Australia, the United States, Korea, and France. Exports decreased to the Dutch East Indies, Japan, India, the Soviet Union, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Siam, and Annam. On the import side, imports increased the most from Australia, followed by Siam. In addition, imports from Annam, Japan, and Germany also increased. Imports from the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the Dutch East Indies, India, the Soviet Union, France, and Korea decreased.</p>
<p>Trade by Port: The rise and fall of foreign trade in various Chinese ports in the first half of this year is also worth noting. Comparing the first half of this year with the same period last year, on the export side, Qingdao, Shantou, Hankou, Nanjing, Wuhu, Yantai, Gongbei, and Mengzi all increased. Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Xiamen, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Jiangmen, Wuzhou, and Qinhuangdao decreased. On the import side, compared with the same period last year, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shantou, Chaobei, Wuzhou, Hankou, and Ningbo increased, while Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Jiangmen, Mengzi, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Yantai, and Qinhuangdao decreased.</p>
<p>Trend Summary: In summary, we can summarize the trends in China's foreign trade for the first half of this year into the following points: (1) In terms of trade values, both exports and imports decreased in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, but the degree of decline seems to have eased compared to before. According to our research, the decline in exports this year is still due to the decrease in export volume, and the reason for the decrease in export volume is closely related to the high silver prices and prolonged exchange rates in recent years. The decline in import values is the result of a decrease in both import prices and import volume. (2) In the first half of this year, because the degree of decline in exports was not as severe as the decline in imports, the import surplus decreased compared to the same period last year, and the gold and silver export surplus decreased due to the government's restrictions on silver exports and encouragement of silver imports. From this, it can be seen that China's trend of using precious metals to offset commodity import surpluses has greatly decreased in the first half of this year. (3) In commodity trade, on the import side, three major staple grains - rice, wheat, and flour - all increased in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. This is naturally due to the disasters last year. Building materials and production tools, such as machinery, timber, and metals, also increased compared to last year. This is due to the development of China's economic construction in recent years. However, cotton has decreased significantly. In addition, other consumer goods have either increased or decreased, generally not differing much from last year. On the export side, tung oil, metals, ores, peanuts, drawnwork and embroidery, coal, and sausage casings increased compared to last year, livestock and tobacco maintained their original state, and others such as cotton yarn, silk, tea, egg products, hides and furs, wool, silk fabrics, cotton, cotton cloth, and pig bristles all decreased. Although there have also been some changes in trade by country and port, they are generally the same as in previous years.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests an Increase in Import Taxes on Foreign Silk Fabrics <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to increase import taxes on foreign silk fabrics. The submission reads: Regarding the request, on the 31st of this month, the Electrical Machinery Factory Trade Association and the Silk Fabric Trade Association jointly sent a letter stating that the previous letter from our associations requesting your chamber to forward to the government a request to refund the import tax on artificial silk raw materials in order to help the foreign trade had been approved by the Ministry of Finance with Guan Zi No. 7271, which stated: "We have received your submission and learned that refunding the import tax on artificial silk raw materials is related to helping the domestic silk industry, and the request cannot be approved. Please be informed." We can see that the government's assistance to the domestic silk industry is comprehensive and meticulous. However, the current situation of the domestic silk weaving industry is that silk prices have plummeted, business is declining, foreign trade sales are almost non-existent, domestic market sales are also decreasing, and the trend of decline is increasing day by day. The reasons are many, but the surge in imports of foreign artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics is a major blow. The reason for the surge in imports is that the import tax rate on artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics is not only not balanced with the import tax on artificial silk raw materials, but is also lower. Therefore, it is easier to dump products in China to achieve low costs and high profits. The collection of import tax on artificial silk raw materials has always been based on quantity, not price, while the collection of import tax on artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics is based on price, not quantity. In 1920, the import tax rate on artificial silk was 58 gold units per Chinese dan, equivalent to about 120 yuan in national currency. At that time, the value of artificial silk was about 100 yuan in national currency per Chinese dan, so the import tax rate per dan of artificial silk was 60% of the value. The import tax on artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics was 80% of the value, so it was still balanced. Foreign artificial silk fabrics could not be dumped in China. Now, the import tax on artificial silk has been changed to 1.20 gold units per kilogram, equivalent to about 2.4 yuan in national currency, while the current value of artificial silk is only about 0.9 yuan per kilogram, so the import tax rate per kilogram is as high as 250% of the value. However, the import tax rate on artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics has not been changed, so the difference between the raw material tax and the product tax is huge. Foreign merchants are taking advantage of this by turning to manufacturing fabrics and importing them in large quantities, sucking the lifeblood of our domestic silk weaving industry. If dumping is allowed to continue without restraint, the impact will not only disrupt market prices, but also have unimaginable consequences for the national economy and people's livelihood. Our associations feel the pain deeply and cannot remain silent. We are writing to your chamber to request that you forward this to the government and promptly correct the tax rate, clearly ordering the customs to increase the import tax rate on artificial silk fabrics and blended fabrics, or to reduce the import tax on artificial silk raw materials, so that the import tax rates on raw materials and fabrics are balanced, in order to prevent large-scale imports of foreign silk, maintain the precarious survival of domestic silk, strive to compete with foreign silk, and restore silk sales in order to provide relief. We have learned that the current import tariff rules of the customs impose an import tax on foreign silk fabrics, whether the raw material is cocoon silk or artificial silk, at a rate of 80% of the value. However, because the import of artificial silk is currently taxed on a per-quantity basis, it reaches 250% of the value according to the market price. Therefore, foreign merchants are changing their plans and importing them in large quantities by converting them into fabrics, which is more profitable. Our country's weaving factories, in turn, have difficulty competing due to the heavy tax on raw materials. The purpose of heavy taxation on manufactured goods to protect domestic factories is counterproductive. The request of the two associations to amend the above import tax rate and strive to balance the raw material tax rate and the fabric tax rate is an essential plan to protect weaving factories. We hereby submit this request to your ministry for review and approval for implementation, which would be fair and convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Miscellaneous Grains Association Encourages Oil Mills to Resume Operations First <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>—Oil Mills Indicate They Will Only Resume Operations After the Bran Surcharge Is Cancelled—</p>
<p>Since the oil cake factories and transporters in various regions went on strike and ceased operations in protest against the imposition of an additional tax on bran in Guangdong Province, it has been two months, and they are still continuing to persist. The Municipal Miscellaneous Grains Association, in consideration of agricultural production and the livelihoods of workers, has specially encouraged the oil mills to resume operations first. However, due to the burden, the oil mills have indicated that they will only resume operations after the bran surcharge is cancelled. Otherwise, they are determined to sacrifice business. The details of the situation have been reported by a Dagongshe reporter as follows:</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Association Encourages Resumption of Operations</p>
<p>The Municipal Miscellaneous Grains Association yesterday sent a letter to the Oil Mill Association encouraging resumption of operations. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, Since the imposition of an additional tax on bran in Guangdong Province, factories and transporters in various regions have ceased operations for more than two months. The All-China Federation of Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Industries is currently striving to have this surcharge cancelled. However, it is now the time for new soybeans to be harvested. If the oil mills continue to suspend operations, the soybeans will be unsalable, and farmers in the producing areas will be in dire straits. Transporters engaged in soybeans will also have their livelihoods cut off. Considering the various oil mills, the workers' lives are also difficult to maintain. This has a negative impact on agriculture, industry, and commerce. After weighing the gains and losses and making overall plans, our association believes that the bran surcharge should be vigorously opposed, but the oil mills' suspension of operations can be handled flexibly. For the sake of the livelihood of farmers, transporters, and oil mill workers in the soybean producing areas, it seems possible to resume operations first. Therefore, we are sending this letter to you. Whether it is appropriate, we hope your association will consider and handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>Oil Mills Indicate They Will Strive to Eliminate the Bran Surcharge</p>
<p>The Oil Mill Trade Association replied to the letter from the Miscellaneous Grains Association, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter stating that it is now the time for new soybeans to be harvested, and for the sake of the livelihood of farmers, transporters, and oil mill workers in the soybean producing areas, it seems possible to resume operations first. We acknowledge this. The sales of bean cakes and peanut cakes produced by the oil mills in our city have always been mainly in Guangdong Province. Since Guangdong Province imposed an additional surcharge, domestic cakes are treated the same as Northeast cakes, with the same tax rate. It is difficult to compete with them. The Guangdong Province cake sales market will be monopolized by Northeast cakes, with no room for domestic cakes. If we resume operations before the surcharge is cancelled, the bean cakes produced will have no sales and will inevitably be stored for a long time and become moldy, increasing losses. Rather than suffering even greater losses after resuming operations, we would rather suspend operations to strive for the cancellation of the surcharge. We hereby reply to you, and we hope you will take this into consideration." Signed, Shanghai Oil Mill Trade Association.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Urging of Representatives from Various Regions to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>The All-China Federation of Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Industries telegraphed the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Associations in Jinan, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, and Hankou, requesting them to send representatives to Shanghai as soon as possible to participate in the petition. The original telegram stated: "In order to strive for the cancellation of the additional agricultural special tax on bran in Guangdong Province, the All-China Federation of Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Industries requests that representatives be sent to Shanghai to participate in the joint meeting held on the 29th of last month. It was decided to organize the 'Federation for Requesting the Cancellation of the Additional Agricultural Special Tax on Bran in the All-China Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Industries,' and a committee was appointed to start working immediately. It was also decided to jointly go to Beijing on the 8th of this month to petition the Fifth National Congress. We hope that you will promptly appoint representatives and come to Shanghai before the 8th of this month to jointly plan the next steps. Please let us know in advance."</p>

(4) In order to facilitate communication between the public security bureau and the district schools, each public security sub-bureau will prepare a sign-in book and hand it over to the teachers of each literacy school for safekeeping. The commissioner sent by each public security bureau will visit each literacy school once a week for inspection and sign the sign-in book during the inspection for evaluation. (5) Each public security sub-bureau and the director of each district must hold a discussion meeting at least once a month. (6) For the sake of further accuracy in the investigation of illiterate people, each director will consult with the investigation committee, or cooperate with the public security bureau when investigating households.

<h3 id="e81">The Zhejiang General Association Telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Request the Abolition of the Household Tax for the Security Corps <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang General Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday to request the abolition of the household tax for the Security Corps in order to reduce the burden on the people. The original text reads: "We have learned that the collection of the household tax for the Security Corps in Zhejiang Province was previously considered by the Ministry of Finance to be a property tax and should not be allocated on a per-household basis, resulting in apportionment. This household tax should be incorporated into the property tax. We respectfully request that your government correct this matter. However, your government still uses the amount of land owned by each household as the standard for differentiated taxation. This not only fails to understand the central government's concern for the people's difficulties and cultivation of the national foundation, but also the management of the Security Corps' expenses and the training and command are unified at the district level, and the districts are unified at the provincial level. The burden on the people who freely contribute to each county is endless, and the amount actually used for the teams is limited. Moreover, the fertility of the land in each county, the thinness of the products, the poverty and wealth of the people, the amount of tax revenue, and the severity of the bandits are all different. It is still difficult to raise funds, and it is not easy to control expenses. In order to reconcile surpluses and deficits, suit the economic path, and achieve the grand effect of practical and economical operation, we should earnestly abolish all illegal and trivial miscellaneous taxes collected locally and reduce the burden on the people. Therefore, Chairman Chiang issued the directive on the General Outline for Improving the Security System in Various Provinces. The provincial governments should earnestly follow this spirit and not deviate from Chairman Chiang's original intention of relieving the people's suffering. Moreover, in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Finance Department and the Security Office submitted twelve measures, which were presented to Chairman Chiang and telegraphed, and the item of land tax in the measures was clearly ordered not to be increased. It is even more inappropriate to avoid the name but maintain the reality, still using the land as the standard for taxation, and borrowing the household tax as a disguised land tax, which violates Chairman Chiang's grand intention of improvement. Moreover, the Haicheng County Security Corps' expenses are still charged from the original donation numbers on the spot. In addition, 0.5 yuan is levied on each yuan of grain as a household tax to be sent to the province. This is an uncompensated additional burden on top of the original Security Corps donation, a disguised increase in taxes. This is not only unbearable for the people's strength, but also how can it show the country's great credibility? The county magistrates of each county, or feel that the training and command of the Security Corps are concentrated in the province and cannot achieve the practical effect of local defense, therefore, they separately establish new names and open up new taxes. For example, the Longquan County Gangkun Strongmen Brigade even wants to levy an additional eight yuan per mu, although your government considers the people's difficulties and is still cautiously reviewing it and has not yet approved it, but I am afraid that the various counties that imitate this will be endless. The melon of Huangtai, holding the vine is worrying. After deliberation at the members' congress of our association, in order to take care of political credibility and express the people's difficulties, we respectfully request that your government follow the central government and Chairman Chiang's intention to reduce the burden on the people, and incorporate the household tax for the Security Corps into the property tax. The families of the people are not rich, and originally did not become thieves. They are not required to practice group defense and have no need to be protected. Therefore, they should not be on the burden list, and should be exempted from collection. In addition to the household donations and shop donations of the Security Corps in various places in the past, all should be abolished in order to establish political credibility and relieve the people's difficulties. Sincerely. The Zhejiang General Association."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Wufeng Company to explain the stamp duty regulations for lease contracts and house tickets: "We have received your letter of the 31st of this month and fully understood the contents. Article 16, Section 10 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that lease documents and contracts must be affixed with a stamp worth 2 cents per document, and those who use booklets to collect rent must affix a stamp worth 2 jiao per year, and those with a lease amount of less than 10 yuan per document are exempt from stamping. Therefore, according to the above regulations, (1) each lease contract must be affixed with a stamp worth 2 cents, and those less than 10 yuan are exempt from stamping; (2) if house tickets are used instead of booklets to collect rent, they are also considered lease documents, and each one must be affixed with a stamp worth 2 cents, and those less than 10 yuan are exempt from stamping; (3) when renting a house, the middleman and guarantor are jointly signing the lease contract, and there is no so-called independent guarantee.

<p>Issuing a Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Rentsu News Agency issued a statement in Japanese on behalf of the study group. The translated version is as follows: "The Economic Inspection Group of the Republic of China, consisting of fourteen members initiated by the Japan Telegraph and Telephone News Agency to commemorate the 35th anniversary of its founding, departed from Tokyo on October 7th, passed through Kobe via the sea route, and landed in Qingdao on the 11th of this month. Then, via Jinan, they went to Beiping and Tianjin, and also visited Zhangjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang. Afterward, they went south to inspect Hankou and Wuchang, and via Nanjing and Suzhou, arrived in Shanghai today. During this one-month inspection, we have been warmly welcomed by officials and civilians of both China and Japan in various places, and have been provided with great convenience in our inspection, for which the group is deeply grateful. Historically, China and Japan, in order to maintain peace in the East and promote East Asian culture, have stood on the basis of mutual cooperation. Not only are they of the same script and race, but also their relationships have been particularly close since ancient times. In order to fulfill this mission, it seems necessary to intensify the relationship of mutual assistance in the economic sphere, to seek economic integration, and to strive for the independent development of the East Asian economy. The members of this inspection group are engaged in the manufacture of daily necessities in Japan and are also directly selling them in the market. They are particularly concerned about the movements of the Chinese economic sector on a daily basis. Today, we have arrived in Shanghai, the center of Chinese economic activity and the central port of Sino-Japanese trade, and we are very fortunate to have the opportunity to actually inspect it. We sincerely hope to bring back the lessons learned to our homeland and contribute to the mission of making the economies of China and Japan closer. On the occasion of our economic inspection group's arrival in Shanghai, we dare to express our humble opinions and hope for the support of officials and civilians on both sides of China and Japan."

<h3 id="e91">The Reduced Levy of Deed Tax in Shanghai County Extended Again <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the provincial government to reduce the deed tax rate on the sale of houses by 6.3%, and the extension has been made several times until the end of October this year. It should have been levied at the tax rate of 9.6% for the sale, and no further extension will be granted. However, this year, the counties in northern Jiangsu suffered from yellow water disasters, and the autumn harvest in other counties was not very abundant. If the reduced levy is not continued, it will inevitably be beyond their ability and they will be reluctant to move forward, which is contrary to the way of enriching taxes and caring for the people. Now, from November of this year to the end of January of next year, the extension will be granted for another three months, and it will still be levied at 6.3% for the sale, and the surcharge shall not exceed half of the principal tax, in order to lighten the burden, etc. After receiving the order, the county government announced it to the public yesterday, urging them to pay taxes on all untaxed deeds during this extended period of reduced levy, so as not to make mistakes again.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Telegraph Bureau Implemented the New Method of Paying International Telegram Fees Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Method of Trial Implementation in the 22nd Year is Abolished</p>
<p>In order to promote international telegraph business and facilitate public communication, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated a new method of paying for international incoming telegrams, ordering it to be implemented by the local International Telegraph Bureau on a scheduled basis. After receiving the order, the bureau chief, Wen Yuqing, immediately transferred it to the international radio stations and submarine cable telegraph receiving and sending offices, ordering them to implement the law starting today. The method of paying for international telegrams by the recipient, which has been implemented since March 1, 1933, will also be abolished at the same time starting today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "It has been repeatedly instructed in orders No. 293 and No. 2910 issued on March 9th and June 12th of last year that staff members of all state-run agencies under the Ministry must be humble, sincere, and courteous when dealing with Chinese and foreign people on a daily basis. However, according to inspections and reports from various parties over the past year, there are still cases of arrogance and slow service among the staff of various bureaus, causing embarrassment to others. There are also cases where, after being reported and ordered to investigate, the responsible personnel of the bureaus try to cover things up, and give an ambiguous reply. Such accumulated habits are difficult to eradicate, and there is a repeated disregard of orders. It is extremely hateful. In recent years, the Ministry has made a start in reorganizing and promoting various major undertakings, and the laws and regulations have gradually become complete. The business situation is also developing day by day. However, it is regrettable that staff members still lack courtesy in dealing with people, which is criticized by society. This harms the group and obstructs discipline, and must be strictly corrected. Therefore, we reiterate the order to all staff members of each bureau to reflect on themselves, correct their mistakes if they have any, and strive to improve if they have none. If such situations still occur, they will be severely punished without leniency. Responsible personnel of each bureau who try to cover things up will also be subject to the same punishment. In addition to separate orders, this order is to be transferred to all staff members under the bureau to strictly comply with it, without neglecting it. Be sure to do so."</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Lead the Guidance Team to Advise Shops and Residents to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has formulated a New Life Movement experimental zone plan. The plan and the measures for citizens in the Confucius Temple area to practice a new life were announced the day before yesterday. The details have been reported in previous news. It is now understood that the New Life Movement plan in the Confucius Temple area was implemented the day before yesterday (the 30th). The Inspection District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched several personnel to the Confucius Temple area every day to lead the New Life Movement Labor Service Corps (i.e., the Guidance Team) to actively work by visiting shops and residents to advise them to implement it. It has been several days, and the guidance and implementation have been carried out without any slackening. The main goal of the work is to enable the citizens in the area to follow the measures for practicing a new life promulgated by the bureau, item by item, and put them into practice, so that the promotion of the New Life Movement will not become empty talk on paper. Those who do not comply after being advised will be warned. Those who repeatedly resist and refuse to comply after being warned will be punished in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment of Violations of Police Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e97">China Merchants Bureau: The Issue of Ship Crew Deducting for Disaster Relief has been Resolved <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>First Deducting One-Quarter of Monthly Salary, Then Another One-Quarter Next Month</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the misunderstanding caused by the issue of deducting salary for disaster relief among all crew members of the state-run China Merchants Bureau has been resolved. The two labor unions of the local marine engineers and captains sent a letter to the bureau, stating that they were willing to deduct half a month's salary from the double salary savings of each person over the years to pay for the disaster relief fund. Since the end of October has passed and the bureau is about to pay wages and deduct for the disaster relief fund, the representatives of the marine engineers' union, Feng Yuming, together with the representatives of the bureau's labor union, You Zhijun, Zheng Xuliang, etc., met with Liu Hongsheng yesterday morning to request that half a month's salary be withdrawn from the savings as a disaster relief fund to avoid affecting the economy of the crew members and workers. Liu Hongsheng persuaded the three representatives, saying that the deduction for disaster relief was determined by the ministry and commission, and the bureau was not in a position to violate the measures. As for the double salary savings, he himself could be responsible for raising a part of the cash and then submitting it to the ministry for approval to be issued to everyone. This would not hinder the lives and economy of each person. Now, one-quarter of the monthly salary will be deducted first, and another one-quarter will be deducted next month. A dispute has finally been resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Affected by Gold Prices, the Silk Ribbon and Electric Bulb Industries Have Increased Prices <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Importers of woolen cloth and other goods must pay in cash; exporters of silk, tea, and other goods are buying in large quantities.</p>
<p>Due to the recent soaring gold prices, the prices of imported goods have also increased accordingly. The silk ribbon and electric bulb industries have issued notices of price increases. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silk Ribbon Industry</p>
<p>The local silk ribbon industry association has recently been affected by the rise in gold prices and the fall in silver prices, causing the price of rayon to soar. The original selling price is difficult to maintain. A special notice has been issued stating that prices will be increased by 20% starting from November 1st. The notice states: "Dear colleagues, due to the impact of the recent rise in gold prices and the fall in silver prices, the cost of raw materials has risen sharply. If we continue to sell at the old prices, it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, we have convened a special meeting and decided that all goods will increase in price by 10% starting from November 1st to maintain our capital and make up for our losses. We hope that all dealers will understand."</p>
<p>Electric Bulb Industry</p>
<p>Electric bulb factories have also issued notices of a 10% price increase. The original text states: "Dear colleagues, our factories have been manufacturing electric bulbs for years. We have been affected by the downturn in the market, and due to the competition among colleagues, the selling price has been falling, and we have been suffering deeply. In recent years, we have also encountered a shortage of raw materials, and prices have been soaring, increasing our costs. The selling price is still the same as before, and we must purchase raw materials in cash, while wholesale electric bulbs are mostly sold on credit. Our situation is even more difficult than before. Although our factories have been struggling to support ourselves, we feel that there are hidden dangers. If we do not seek remedies urgently, the consequences will be unthinkable. Therefore, we have gathered colleagues from all over Shanghai to discuss solutions. We have unanimously agreed on the following articles, and we hope that all customers from home and abroad will understand and appreciate them: (1) Starting from November 1st of this year, the selling price will be increased by 10% across the board. (2) All goods sold will not be exchanged. (3) Accounts must be settled at the end of each month, and the outstanding amount must be paid in full in order to facilitate turnover. Checks are limited to ten days."</p>
<p>Imports and Exports</p>
<p>European and American foreign firms importing goods are suspending orders due to the instability of foreign exchange rates, and merchants such as paint dealers have been requiring cash payments since last month. Other imported goods such as woolen cloth, machinery, textiles, and miscellaneous goods also require cash payments. Due to the gold price situation, exporters are also buying in large quantities. Sales of tea, silk, eggs, and other goods have been strong recently, and prices have also soared accordingly.</p>

<p>Serving as Temporary Shop Assistants at the Commercial Press Bookstore Today</p>
<p>Production education has recently been emphasized by all parties, who are making efforts to promote it. However, students of commercial subjects in vocational schools often suffer from a lack of practical opportunities. Now, the Shanghai branch of the Commercial Press Bookstore has specially stipulated that starting from November, the bookstore's sales hall will be used as a practice venue for commercial students from various secondary schools in Shanghai every Saturday, using the bookstore's own publications as the scope, in order to increase the practical opportunities for commercial students from various secondary schools in Shanghai. Today (November 2nd), commercial students from the Chinese Vocational School will organize a student practice group to participate in the practice. All of today's retail business will be undertaken by the participating students. All services will also be provided automatically by the practice students. The original staff of the bookstore will retreat to a guiding position. The student practice group will elect a director and a deputy director to preside over everything, and will also appoint a number of salespersons, receptionists, and inspectors to take on various positions, opening up a new path for commercial students to practice, which will greatly benefit production education. It is also heard that next Saturday (November 9th) has been scheduled for the students of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commercial School to practice. Other schools, such as Guanghua University Affiliated High School, Qingxin Middle School, Shanghai High School, and Xinhuan Vocational Middle School, have also scheduled dates. The bookstore has also stipulated that the student practice group should hold a preparatory meeting at the school before the event, and the bookstore will send staff to the meeting to provide guidance and explain the various procedures and matters that should be noted in detail. If necessary, they may also visit the bookstore once in advance. After the practice, a discussion meeting will be held again at the school, and the bookstore will still send staff to the meeting to explain the various doubts and problems that the students felt during the practice. The method is very perfect and appropriate. Both the bookstore and the school practice group sincerely welcome all parties to visit and provide guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Both Parties Appeal in the Cai Yang Case; Bao Defu Found Not Guilty <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Cai Fan's Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>After the Longshun public land cargo company was robbed, Bao Defu, the owner of the company, suspected that Cai Yangqi, the old clerk, was involved. He reported this to Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective of the Old Gate Police Station, who arrested and escorted Cai. After trial, a Special District Court found him not guilty. However, Cai's wife, Cai Fan, accused Lang of inflicting injury and Bao of falsely accusing her husband in the Special District Court. Because Lang failed to appear despite repeated summons, the court repeatedly requested the Ministry of Justice to forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and negotiate with the diplomatic corps, but to no avail. Therefore, the portion of the case against Lang was suspended, and a verdict was issued solely on the portion of Bao's false accusation, sentencing Bao to one year in prison. Both parties, feeling dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed. The Second Branch of the High Court has already concluded the trial. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Zhao Zhengtao, along with Judges Zhou and Zhong, opened Criminal Court One and issued a formal judgment: The original judgment regarding Bao Defu's conviction was overturned, Bao Defu was found not guilty, and Cai Fan's appeal was rejected. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit was also rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Municipal Central Detective Squad Solves Murder Case, Arrests Perpetrators <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Jin Miaosheng, Jin Mao Da, Tao Rongsheng, Three Men</p>
<p>Previously, Gao Xuan, a poor Shandong scavenger in Wangjiabang, Songhu Road, Jiangwan, was beaten to death by local residents Jin Miaosheng, Jin Fufu, Jin Tisheng, and Jin Furong. The case was reported to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation and arrest of the murderers. However, the suspects had absconded, making it impossible to apprehend them for a time. Later, the court issued official letter No. 302 to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for their arrest. At the same time, the Central Detective Squad also received Instruction No. 102705 from the Public Security Bureau Headquarters, stating in brief: "According to the complaint submitted by Cai Mengwu, his cousin Gao Xuan was murdered for no reason, requesting strict apprehension of the murderers and prosecution according to law." Therefore, after the case occurred, Ji Yuanpu and Wang Huibai, the captain and deputy captain of the Public Security Bureau Detective Corps, immediately instructed Wu Kezhong and Chu Jingwu, the captain and deputy captain of the Central Detective Squad, to conduct a thorough investigation. Until about 1:00 PM on the 31st of last month, Detective Cao Maosheng learned that the murderer Jin Miaosheng was going to Jiangwan for a wedding banquet. Captains Wu and Chu, upon receiving the report, immediately led leaders Wang Yao and Bao Guanwu, detective Cao Maosheng, and police officers dispatched by the Jiangwan Police Station to a small teahouse opened by a Gao family on Xinshi Road to lie in wait. Shortly after, Jin Miaosheng arrived and was apprehended. He claimed to be 42 years old, a local resident living at No. 8 Wangjiabang, Songhu Road, and admitted to beating Gao Xuan to death with Jin Fufu, Jin Tisheng, and Jin Furong. However, after the incident, his father, Jin Zigao, and Jin Fufu's father, Jin Miaoqing, entrusted a person named Ma Changshu to settle the matter, spending a total of 7-800 yuan. Later, Jin Mao Da and Tao Rongsheng brought 300 yuan. Because I had no money, I mortgaged 1.8 mu of land for 70 yuan. Jin Tisheng took out 80 yuan, and Jin Fufu and Jin Furong contributed 150 yuan together. On October 5th, Jin Mao Da and Tao Rongsheng sent three copies of a newspaper, saying that our matter had been settled and published in the newspaper, telling us to rest assured. After receiving the confession, the squad dispatched Tao Jinsen, Peng Jie, and others to Jiangwan and Wangjiabang to arrest the suspects, apprehending Jin Mao Da and Tao Rongsheng. Their confessions were very cunning. Jin Fufu, Jin Ti Quan, and Jin Shi have all fled upon hearing the news. The squad then handed over the arrest warrant and the suspects Jin Miaosheng, extortionist Jin Mao Da, and Tao Rongsheng to the Central Branch Bureau. Director Huang Liuguang immediately dispatched officer Zhang Lourong to interrogate them. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Xu Dawu, Mute Zhongyan Flees; Two Women and Paramours Arrested</p>
<p>Xu Dawu, a 36-year-old from Changzhou who set up fortune-telling stalls, and his colleague, Mute Zhongyan (the business name, real name unknown), 26 years old, checked into room number five of the Lixing Inn at 341 Avenue Foch (near the slaughterhouse) in the French Concession on the 28th of last month. During the day, the two went out separately to conduct business. On the evening of the 31st, they went to the Tianyun Building on the roof of Wing On Company, where they met female attendants Li Xiuying (33 years old, from Haimen) and Wu Gendi (31 years old, from Ningbo). The two women lived together at No. 34, Shangyi Lane, Xiaocai Field, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession. Li had an affair with Zhang Fusheng, 31 years old, from Haining, and Wu had an affair with Chen Yongxing, 29 years old, from the same hometown. They lived in adjacent rooms. The two women struck up a conversation, quickly becoming inseparable. In fact, the two women were prostitutes. Xu and Mute took Li and Wu back to the Lixing Inn for illicit relations. Xu and Li stayed in the original room number five, while Mute and Wu opened another room, number eight. Upon arriving at the inn, the two women immediately demanded prostitution fees. Xu and others replied that they had eighty yuan deposited in the inn's accounting office, but the accountant was not present at the moment. They would retrieve it in the morning and pay the full amount without shortage. Li and Wu, seeing Xu and Mute dressed in Western suits and appearing wealthy, did not suspect a trick and believed them. They each returned to their rooms. Little did they know that overnight, the two women got up at 7 am and asked Xu and Mute for the prostitution fees. To their surprise, Xu and others had no money at all. The agreement made the previous night was purely a deception. The two women were furious and started arguing. Mute seized the opportunity to escape without a trace. Li Xiuying kept Xu Dawu from leaving. Wu Gendi went home to call her and Li’s paramours, Zhang Fusheng and Chen Yongxing. They gathered several hoodlums and rushed to Lixing Inn, where they questioned Xu, demanding the prostitution fees. Seeing the disparity in numbers, Xu felt trapped and jumped out of the window of room five on the third floor to escape. He fell to the ground, crushing the back of his head, bleeding profusely, and dying instantly. The inn's tea boy discovered the incident and detained Li and Wu, as well as Zhang and Chen. They reported the incident to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and took the two women and two men to the police station for questioning. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for examination. It is scheduled to be reported to the court for inspection today.</p>

<p>Zhang Qingyu: Zhang Qingyu, a 45-year-old from Ningbo, was a peddler residing at No. 760 Chengdu Road. At around 9:30 am yesterday, Zhang was drying clothes by the window when he accidentally lost his footing and fell. His brain matter splattered, and blood flowed all over the ground. He died instantly. The local police were called to transport the body to Renji Hospital for examination.</p>

It was a gruesome sight. He died on the spot. The local police were notified and transported the body to Tongren Hospital for examination.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiaming, a Ningbo man who worked as a bill collector for the Sichuan Road Hamlin &amp; Co., conspired with Wang Yi (at large) to steal thirty boxes of artificial silk worth 15,000 yuan from Anli Foreign Firm using forged bills of lading on June 3rd of this year. They transported the silk to the same road’s Liji Sheng Auction House, where they colluded with Chen Bingzhang, a local silver dollar manager, to open the boxes, replace the wrapping paper, and auction off the silk at a low price of 82,500 yuan. Zhang received a commission and reward totaling 430 yuan, and Chen received a special commission of 30%, totaling 2,470 yuan. The remainder was obtained by Wang Yi. After the case was discovered, Zhang and Chen were arrested by Hongkou police detectives Jin Guanya and Hu Jihe and sent to the First Special District Local Court. After questioning and clear confessions, the closing arguments were held, and the sentence was awaited. Chen remained out on bail for 3,000 yuan with his original shop as guarantor.

<h3 id="e110">Full Text of Gu Zhuxuan's Judgment <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Investigating whether the defendant instigated the murder of Tang, referring to the Supreme Court's judgment date. Gu handed over a pistol and adopted Zhang Tinggui's confession. Xue Zhenyi's three letters to Zheng Qian can prove it.</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former head of the Zhabei Security Corps, the president of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, and the owner of the Tianchan Theater, a native of Fallen City, Jiangsu, in June of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], instigated Wang Xinggao, Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and the fugitive Zhou the Carpenter, etc., to assassinate Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World, resulting in his death. At the same time, a passerby, Wu Guangcai (a native of Yangzhou, working as a waiter in a bathhouse, whose coffin and burial expenses were paid by the Tang family after his death, and his remains were claimed by his family), was killed by a stray bullet. The crime was reported by the felon Zhao Guangfu to the Law Enforcement Department. On September 10th, Gu was arrested by the French Concession Police and sent to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for the crime of instigating murder. After repeated trials by Judge Wang Wangxu, accompanied by Assessors Xiong Huiping and Zhang Chaozuo, who together confirmed that Gu had committed the crime, on the 28th of last month, a judgment was pronounced sentencing Gu Zhuxuan to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. During the appeal period, he was remanded to the detention center and temporarily detained at the Guangci Hospital. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. The judgment has been sent to the police station, and we have looked for and recorded it.</p>
<p>The full text of the judgment is as follows: Criminal Judgment No. 334, Jiesu, of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, the twenty-fourth year of the Republic [1935]. Judgment against the defendant Gu Zhuxuan, male, age fifty, native of Yancheng, occupation merchant, residing at No. 9, Yonghe Lane, No. 222, North Xizang Road, elected defense attorneys Wu Kaisheng, Xue Dubi, and Lin Dawen. The above-mentioned defendant was prosecuted by the French Concession Police Department for the case of instigating murder. This court, after hearing the case, makes the following judgment:</p>
<p>Main text: Gu Zhuxuan is sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for instigating murder and ten years of deprivation of civil rights.</p>
<p>Facts: Gu Zhuxuan harbored resentment towards Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park. In June of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], he ordered Wang Xinggao, also known as Wang Jinkui, to secretly invite people to find a way to kill him. Wang Xinggao first booked Room 208 on the second floor of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII as a meeting place. On June 12th, Wang Xinggao and Zhou Qifu went to Hengfeng Road in Zhabei and invited Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, to participate, explaining that this was Gu Zhuxuan's matter and there was no need to be afraid. They also instructed him to invite others. Zhang Tinggui then invited Gu Dengyang and Zhou the Carpenter (also known as Zhou Mingxiang) to join. On the afternoon of June 13th, at around 10:00 PM, Zhou Qifu invited Zhang Tinggui to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel. Gu Zhuxuan also arrived at the location. After Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao had a private conversation, Gu took out two pistols and handed them to Wang Xinggao and left. At around 9:00 AM on June 16th, Zhou the Carpenter went to Datong Road in Zhabei and invited Zhao Guangfu, explaining that Gu Zhuxuan wanted to kill his enemy and invited him to participate. After Zhao Guangfu agreed, Zhou the Carpenter invited him to the Renhe Teahouse in Xinqiao, where he met with Wang Xinggao. Wang Xinggao and Zhou the Carpenter then invited Zhao Guangfu to Room 208 on the second floor of the Asia Hotel. Shortly after, Gu Zhuxuan entered the room and said that the manager of the Great World was his enemy and told them to do it without worry. It was then decided that Gu Dengyang and Zhao Guangfu would carry out the deed, Zhang Tinggui would act as a lookout, and Wang and Gao's grandson would deliver the pistols. Zhang Tinggui was also instructed to scout out Tang Jiapeng's daily arrival time from the Great World. On the night of June 16th, 22nd year of the Republic [1933], they waited together at the entrance of the Great World to kill Tang Jiapeng, but they did not encounter him. The next afternoon, at around 11:00 PM, Zhang Tinggui and others went to the location and waited according to the original plan. At 1:20 AM (that is, the morning of June 18th), they saw Tang Jiapeng walking out of the entrance of the Great World and getting into a car. Gu Dengyang opened fire, and Zhao Guangfu also fired three shots at him. Tang Jiapeng died shortly after being shot. Wu Guangcai, who was walking on the road, was also wounded and killed by stray bullets. Both were examined by the court's forensic doctor, who confirmed that they died from gunshot wounds and attached the autopsy report to the file. Afterwards, Zhang Tinggui received 60 yuan and fled to the countryside. Zhao Guangfu was detained for keeping the pistol and had not yet received his money. On November 28th of the same year, he was arrested by the police department. Zhang Tinggui also filed a lawsuit against Zhao Guangfu in the First Special District Local Court, and this court sentenced Zhao Guangfu to life imprisonment and Zhang Tinggui to 20 years in prison. While the case was being appealed to the Supreme Court, Zhao Guangfu, due to not receiving his reward and being imprisoned, reported Wang Xinggao to the police department in December of last year. Wang Xinggao was arrested by the police department, and this court sentenced him to life imprisonment for the crime of instigating murder. In July of this year, Zhao Guangfu sued Gu Zhuxuan in this court for instigating murder. After this court issued a judgment of non-acceptance, he reported the previous situation to the police department. After Gu Zhuxuan was arrested and interrogated by the police department, he was prosecuted in court according to Article 29 and Article 271 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Reason: Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, was indeed shot and killed by Zhao Guangfu and Gu Dengyang. This has been confirmed by the criminal judgment of Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi. What should be investigated now is whether the defendant in this case actually instigated Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and others to kill Tang Jiapeng. After repeated interrogations by this court, although the defendant firmly refused to confess, attempting to evade criminal responsibility, according to Zhao Guangfu's confession, Tang Jiapeng was killed by Zhou the Carpenter, that is, Zhou Mingxiang, who found me in Zhabei at Hengfeng Road at seven or eight o'clock in the morning on June 16th, 22nd year of the Republic [1933], to have tea. After having tea, we went to the Renhe Teahouse to have tea. Wang Xinggao also came to the Renhe Teahouse. They said that it was the matter of Fourth Master Gu. From the Renhe Teahouse, we went to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel. Gu Zhuxuan came about five minutes later, wearing a long gown that was neither gray nor white. He said, "You can rest assured and do the job. After it's done, I'll give you 10,000 yuan. This person is my enemy," and so on. After repeated interrogations, he insisted on his previous confession, which is consistent with the date of invitation and the room number of the Asia Hotel, as well as the circumstances of meeting the defendant and talking with him, as confessed by Zhao Guangfu in the police department on August 20th of this year. It can also be checked that when Zhao Guangfu reported Wang Xinggao to the police department on December 12th of last year, he also said that on June 16th, Zhou the Carpenter and Wang Xinggao led him to a room on the second floor of the Da Jiangnan Hotel, where he saw the defendant, who said that the assassination of Tang Jiapeng was instigated by the defendant. Although the Da Jiangnan Hotel was located in the Public Concession, which is different from the location he mentioned this time, according to Zhao Guangfu, Zhou the Carpenter said that the Asia Hotel was the Da Jiangnan Hotel. After this court sent police to investigate, it was reported that in the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the Asia Hotel was originally named the Jiangnan Hotel. Also, Zhou Shaolian, the waiter of the Asia Hotel, said that the Asia Hotel had more than 150 rooms, and Room 208 was on the second floor. Since the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the room numbers have not been changed. Therefore, Zhao Guangfu's statement that the previous confession of Da Jiangnan Hotel was the Asia Hotel is still credible. Moreover, Zhao Guangfu submitted a statement to this court on January 8th of this year, and in the murder file of Wang Xinggao and the draft of the self-accusation letter sent to the defendant, it was also written that Wang Xinggao was Wang Jinkui. On February 21st of this year, Zhao Guangfu's confession in this court also stated that "I said Wang Jinkui was Wang Xinggao when I was in custody." Although Zhang Tinggui had a teacher-student relationship with Wang Xinggao (Zhao Guangfu confessed in the police station on December 14th of last year that Zhang Tinggui was Wang Xinggao's disciple), he claimed in this court that he was invited by Wang Jinkui and insisted that he did not know Wang Xinggao, with the intention of protecting him. The circumstances are obvious. Zhao Guangfu also received money (Zhao Guangfu confessed on September 27th of this year that Wang Xinggao promised me money), and after the incident, he said that there were two people. However, judging from the above confessions, Wang Xinggao is Wang Jinkui, which is identifiable. Since Wang Xinggao and Wang Jinkui are the same person, it is even more proof that what Zhao Guangfu said about Wang Xinggao leading him to the Da Jiangnan Hotel was undoubtedly the Asia Hotel. Furthermore, Zhao Guangfu was questioned about why he did not mention what the defendant said when he was in the police station on December 14th of last year. He said, "What he said, I'm still waiting because the Supreme Court's official business hasn't come down yet." When asked why he previously confessed that the reward was 100 yuan, he replied, "I mentioned it in the British Concession. The confession had already been made, so I said what they said." It was found that the date of the Supreme Court's judgment on the case was December 29th of last year. Zhao Guangfu filed the case for investigation after Zhang Tinggui was arrested. Therefore, what he said is true. Looking at Zhao Guangfu's previous and subsequent statements, it is difficult to say that there are any doubts. Furthermore, Zhang Tinggui testified that on June 12th, 22nd year of the Republic [1933], he met Wang Jinkui on Chang'an Road in Zhabei. He said that he had something to ask me to help with. We talked about it in the teahouse. He said that it was the matter of Fourth Master Gu. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM on the 13th, Zhou Qifu led me to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel. When I went in, Fourth Master Gu was already in the room. He spoke to Wang Jinkui, but I didn't hear what he said. Later, Fourth Master Gu took out two pistols and handed them to Wang Jinkui. He said, "You can handle this matter. Wang Jinkui said, "He is the owner of the Tianchan Theater. The police station has already been taken care of. You can rest assured and do it. After it's done, I'll give you 10,000 yuan." Someone also said that Wang Jinkui said afterwards, "The higher-ups only sent down 400 yuan. You take some money first and hide in the countryside. I got 60 yuan." This is consistent with the situation described in the police department on September 2nd of this year. After repeated interrogations, Zhang Tinggui insisted on his previous words and refused to change his statement regarding the meeting with the defendant in the Asia Hotel and seeing the defendant hand over the pistol. Therefore, Zhang Tinggui's statement is also credible. The circumstances of the defendant instigating murder have been described in detail by Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that Tang Jiapeng was killed by the defendant's instigation. Moreover, Zhao Guangfu repeatedly sent letters to the defendant in June and July of this year, demanding payment of the reward. After examining the letters (submitted by the defendants), they stated that "I have previously sent several letters, but have not received a reply. I was instructed by you to shoot Tang Jiapeng, and you personally promised a reward of 10,000 yuan. After the matter was completed perfectly, I was unable to contact you, and the reward could not be obtained. Unfortunately, I was arrested soon after and sentenced to life imprisonment. But I avenged you, exchanging my own life for money. Now that the revenge has been taken, not only is there no reward, but I am being ignored." Zhao Guangfu and the defendant did not know each other and had no grudges, as confessed by the defendant repeatedly. Also, the defendant claimed to be a legitimate businessman who occupied a prominent position in Shanghai society. If there was no instigation of murder, why would the prisoner Zhao Guangfu repeatedly demand a reward from the defendant? Moreover, according to Zhao Guangfu, while the case was on appeal, Xue Zhenyi was in the same detention center. He was the defendant's student and said that the defendant had hired lawyer Zhu to defend him, guaranteeing that he could be released from prison. After questioning Zhang Tinggui, he also confessed to the same situation. Although Xue Zhenyi argued that this was not the case, Xue Zhenyi's appeal for Zhang Tinggui has been admitted by him. Moreover, Xue Zhenyi sent a letter to Zheng Qian on April 2nd of this year, stating that "Zhao wants to falsely accuse the boss again, and he is proceeding in three steps." He also said, "My nephew, based on this, whether it happened before or not, regardless of whether it's related or not, has first explained to Zhao. Zhao said that he just wants the boss to provide assistance. If there is no relationship, you can ignore it. If there is a need for assistance, it is best to avoid it so that nothing else will happen." And in his letter to the defendant, he said, "I have used various words to explain to Zhao that since he was sentenced to life imprisonment, there is hope for him to be a human being in the future. Why should he make false accusations?" He said that he just wanted the adults to assist his family. My nephew promised Zhao to contact the Red Cross and ask friends to assist him, using this as an excuse, and he made it clear that he had to wait two weeks. If this matter is completely unrelated, you can ignore it. If it is slightly involved, it is better to avoid it beforehand to prevent the future. Moreover, Zhao was asked by the Westerner Qiao Huisi in the police station whether he knew someone like a certain adult. Zhao said he knew him. After my nephew questioned him, he really knew him. Now my nephew has copied Zhao's address. If you need to assist him, you can send someone to assist his family in the name of Zhao's old friend, so that nothing boring will happen." Another letter, sent on August 18th of this year, started with the words "Teacher Adult". It is clear that Xue Zhenyi and the defendant have a teacher-student relationship. It is very obvious that he is explaining things from the middle. All the above letters were submitted by the defendant as favorable evidence. Although Zhao Guangfu's letter ended with "If you are awakened or send a perennial consultant to come for a personal meeting, otherwise, I will first file a civil lawsuit to recover the reward, and then I will file a criminal lawsuit to defeat you. I really admire you," and also said, "I will make it so that you have difficulty defending yourself and difficulty expressing your grievances." However, this is a continuation of the previous text. The meaning of the words is nothing more than demanding a reward and being determined to get it. Using this as a reference, it is even more proof that the defendant has indeed committed the act of instigation. As for what Xue Zhenyi said, that he held a note from Zhao Guangfu asking him to testify, and that the prisoner Zhang Shuchuan was sufficient to prove the 3-7 split of the accounts, regardless of the fact that Zhao Guangfu firmly denied writing the note and that Zhao Guangfu repeatedly demanded rewards from the defendant and did not deny it, and that it was after he reported Wang Xinggao in December of last year, the defendant held this as evidence to refute Zhao Guangfu's blackmail and false accusation, which is obviously not credible. Moreover, Shanghai is a commercial center, and there are many people who own millions of assets. Why would Zhao Guangfu dare to accuse the defendant of a major murder case in order to achieve his purpose of defrauding money? If the defendant had nothing to do with it, why didn't he report his blackmail to the relevant authorities for investigation? According to the defendant, Zhang Tinggui is also unfamiliar and has no grudges. This can be asserted. After Zhang Tinggui was arrested and imprisoned, he did not demand any reward from the defendant. Therefore, it is obvious that he had no purpose of blackmail. Why would Zhang Tinggui give clear indications after repeated questioning? In summary, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui's unfavorable statements against the defendant have been deemed to have no doubts and are credible. Then, the fact that the defendant instigated the murder of Tang Jiapeng is extremely clear, and there is no doubt that he should bear the criminal responsibility for murder. However, the new criminal law has been implemented and does not have a special provision for aggravated premeditated murder. Moreover, the defendant is already fifty years old, so he is sentenced to imprisonment at the court's discretion. The defendant in this case should be sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment in accordance with Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 29, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and be deprived of civil rights for ten years in accordance with Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution. The judgment is specially made as the main text. The prosecutor of this case, Wang Ren, appeared in court and stated his opinions. If you do not agree with the judgment, you can file an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court within ten days from the day after the judgment is served. (Omitted below) It is heard that the family of the defendant Gu Zhuxuan has hired a lawyer to write a statement to the Second Special Court, declaring an appeal, requesting that the case file be sent to the higher Third Branch of the High Court so that the reasons for the appeal can be corrected.</p>

<p>The elder brother has been arrested and sentenced in Tianjin, and the younger brother surrendered to the police in Shanghai.</p>
<p>An Wenping and An Wenpu, brothers from Beiping, were previously detained by the Shanghai Public Concession Police and sent to the First Special District Court for defrauding a large amount of antiques in Hong Kong, and were sentenced to a fine of 300 yuan. On January 30th of this year, the An brothers again used deceptive means at the Yangtze River Hotel in Nanjing to defraud Mrs. Lishi Li, a Western woman, of a diamond ring worth 5,000 yuan and escaped. An Wenpu was subsequently arrested by the Tianjin authorities and has already been sentenced. The Public Concession Police are also strictly pursuing An Wenping. Yesterday at noon, An surrendered himself to the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Patrol Room, and was detained by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested permission to detain him because the case had not yet been clarified. Moreover, the Nanjing authorities also intend to bring An back to Nanjing for trial. When questioned, An Wenping confessed that this matter was done by his brother and he had no connection to it. Judge Jiang examined the confession and ruled that he should be detained for one week for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Received four letters in succession, Lu Dehong admitted to writing them.</p>
<p>Jin Xinsan, the manager of the Chinese warehouse of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, lives at No. 8, Yongde Lane, Jielu. On August 31st of this year, Jin suddenly received an anonymous letter delivered by mail. Upon opening it, the words inside were threatening, attempting to extort 2,000 yuan. He was given a deadline of 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on September 1st to negotiate at the intersection of Qiwupu Road and Kunming Road. If he did not agree, there would be danger to Jin's children in the future. Jin reported the letter to the Huishi Police Station, which sent detectives to wait, but no trace of the bandits was found. Subsequently, Jin received three more threatening letters in the past month, and the amount of money demanded gradually decreased. However, although the letters repeatedly arranged a place for negotiation, the bandits failed to appear, and the matter went on for more than a month without any progress in solving the case. It was not until 3:45 PM on the day before yesterday that the Chinese Detective Chief Shang Wu and Detective Wang Youshan of the Huishi Police Station arrested the suspects Lu Taotao and Zhang Er from Tongzhou on Kaifeng Road. Then, another accomplice, Lu Dehong, was arrested on Dixiwei Road and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting them for attempted extortion in accordance with Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, also stated the case, saying that the defendant Lu Dehong admitted in the police station that all four threatening letters were written by him alone. However, a certain Lu, who lives at No. 158, Sichuan Road, also received two threatening letters and reported them to the police station, but they have not yet been solved. However, the handwriting of the threatening letters received by the Lu mentioned above and those received by Jin Xinsan were found to be the same after examination by the Industrial Bureau's handwriting analysis department. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed for continued investigation. Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned the three defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody, pending a postponement for further investigation.</p>

<p>Assassination News Causes Selling Pressure, Prices Fall to 0.06 Yuan. Exchange Rates Unmoved, Easily Raised, Still Increase by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market remained uneasy, actions were abnormal, and trends moved towards "government bonds". Initially, news of the assassination of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Jingyao in Nanjing stirred up selling pressure. Many parties unloaded, prices plummeted. The public panicked because buyers had been relying on the Sixth Plenary Session as a chance for rumors to thrive. It became fatigued and prices fell to 1106 yuan. Unfortunately, the exchange rates remained unchanged and were easily pulled up, resulting in a rebound higher than the previous day. This morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States were stable. Silver prices in Montreux were barely up or down, as were exchange rates. Gold prices in London rose by one penny.

It was anticipated that HSBC would post higher rates, with British currency up by 1.25 and American currency up by 0.25. Prices gradually decreased. However, because banks were still buying, there were multiple transactions in the middle, and exchange rates hardened. Unfavorable rumors circulated, and prices eventually fell below 60 yuan. Banks continued to buy, and buyers were still active, so prices gradually rebounded by nearly 20 yuan. However, because of the sluggish Hong Kong market, prices soon gradually decreased again from above 70 yuan. When Reuters reported that the assassination of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Jingyao had no special impact, public sentiment became abnormal and followed the trend, with many parties rushing to unload. Selling pressure was strong. It was predicted that Indian silver would rise by 3 annas, but prices fell to 1106 yuan. Speculators covered their short positions at low prices. At noon, prices rose to above 30 yuan. The afternoon market was firm due to the raising of prices by Fu Xing Yong (福興永) and Da De Cheng (大德成). After the opening, buyers were eager and prices continued to rise. However, due to HSBC's unloading, prices once fell back to below 40 yuan. Banks had a flat appetite, but public sentiment was still good, so prices were held. Indian silver decreased by 3 annas and broke through the 60 yuan level.

<h3 id="e126">Customs Gold Demand Suddenly Increases <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Silver and Money Industries Guard Against Disturbances —</p>
<p>Since the rumor of Customs Gold Units being issued, the general buying of Customs Gold has suddenly increased. The price in the market has risen to 2.23 yuan, and purchases are very strong. At this time, a certain foreign bank held a large number of banknotes a few days ago and cashed them at various note-issuing banks. The bank authorities, in order to stabilize public sentiment, paid out as usual. However, in order to prevent disturbances, from now on, anyone who holds banknotes to cash them for more than 100 yuan will be given banknotes from other banks. Suddenly, attention was also focused on silver dollars, and tens of thousands of jiao (角) were collected to be shipped to Dalian. Fortunately, the small money shops noticed it and secretly informed each other. Therefore, they unanimously decided that even if the price increased, they would not sell indiscriminately. The situation was considered to be pacified, but the market price had already been pushed up by a huge amount of more than 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Call Loan Rate Still at Seventy Cents <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the financial community believed that after barely surviving the mid-month settlement period, they could take a brief rest. Unexpectedly, the news of President Wang's assassination spread, causing widespread panic. Everyone tried to protect themselves, unable to manage affairs. The market immediately became tense. Although the call loan rate did not change in the morning or afternoon, it remained at twenty cents, an increase of three cents compared to the previous day's market price. Under normal circumstances, the call loan rate could have dropped to forty or fifty cents, but due to this news, it rose again to seventy cents, and there was no supply. They had to wait for the clearinghouse meeting to discuss it further. However, at the clearinghouse meeting, the market remained chaotic, and no funds were released. Finally, a certain firm released seven or eight hundred thousand, but they could only supply a small amount. In the end, there was still a shortage of two or three million, which likely had to be covered by the reserve bank.</p>
<p>In terms of bill transactions, morning transactions amounted to over three million seven hundred thousand, new transactions over two hundred thousand, afternoon transactions over fifty thousand, clearinghouse transactions over eight hundred thousand, foreign mortgage redemptions over nine hundred thousand, new loans made over thirty thousand, banknote withdrawals over nine hundred thousand, issuance of circulating notes over thirty thousand, and secret mark notes over fifty thousand.</p>
<p>Bank settlements: foreign banks settled over two million nine hundred thousand in bills, over four million in various goods and foreign exchange, over eighty thousand in telegraphic transfers, over seventy thousand in special transfers, over ninety thousand in foreign exchange settlements, over fifty thousand in differential settlements, over one million eight hundred thousand in settlement adjustments, and one million two hundred thousand went into storage. Chinese banks settled over three million six hundred thousand in bills, over four million five hundred thousand in various goods, foreign exchange, and taxes, over one million two hundred thousand in special transfers, over ninety thousand in foreign exchange settlements, over ninety thousand in differential settlements, over two million three hundred thousand in settlement adjustments, over twenty thousand in long-term loans, and five hundred thousand went out of storage. Japanese banks settled over three million one hundred thousand in bills, over three million nine hundred thousand in various goods and foreign exchange, over sixty thousand in telegraphic transfers, over ninety thousand in special transfers, over fifty thousand in foreign exchange settlements, over ninety thousand in differential settlements, over two million two hundred thousand in settlement adjustments, and eight hundred thousand went into storage.</p>
<p>Money shops collected over forty-two million four hundred thousand in foreign public bills, over seven million four hundred thousand in foreign head bills, over eighty thousand in various remittance bills, twenty thousand in out-of-town sources, twenty-five thousand in current silver for stomach, one hundred forty thousand in current silver for settlement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Dalian banking community manipulated the Guangdong silver coin market. There was a high demand for Guangdong coins, causing the market price to surge. The morning price was 781 yuan, and the afternoon price was 797 yuan, an increase of 29.6 yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e129">Securities: News from the Capital Causes Public Bonds to Crash <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Only Two Trading Sessions Done All Day, Market Extremely Chaotic. Private Trading Fluctuates Two to Three Yuan Above and Below the Limit-Down Price. Troop Reduction and Long-Term Rehabilitation Uniquely Trending Upward.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced a major market upheaval. At times, it was like a raging storm, with prices plummeting to the limit-down. At other times, it was calm and clear, with vigorous buying activity and fear of being left behind. Only two trading sessions were held throughout the day, and the difference between the high and low prices was like heaven and earth. This kind of market was unprecedented. The sudden arrival of news of the assassination in the capital cast a dark shadow over the market. Short sellers emerged, displaying unusual bravery, as if a major disaster was about to occur. Long positions, however, had not lost hope and continued to push prices up. Therefore, the future situation was impossible to predict. Although the environment was harsh, the long positions seemed unconcerned. If they were to unload their positions, the danger would be difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading started late, after 11:00 am, due to the excessive number of accounts from the previous night. Troop reorganization rose by several cents, and troop reduction for the current month rose by a significant two yuan. Long-term bonds immediately weakened, with the 1921 Customs bonds falling by several cents to between 1 and 2 yuan. After the 20th issue, due to the assassination of President Wang, selling pressure became unusually heavy, and all issues were declared limit-down. Only the long-term 1996 bonds fell slightly by 2.6 yuan, and private trading was even 1 to 2 yuan below the limit-down price. The severity of the situation was an unprecedented change in the past twenty-four years.</p>
<p>After 12:00 pm, issues 44, 54, and 78 repeatedly increased prices in private trading, and by around 4:00 pm, they had risen to 2 to 3 yuan above the limit-up price. This caused a sudden shift in market sentiment. The second trading session started late, after 5:30 pm. All issues that had already reached the limit-down in the first session were temporarily not traded due to margin calls. Troop reduction for the current month only recovered by a little over one yuan, long-term bonds still rose by 30 cents, and rehabilitation bonds even rose by 1 to 2.5 yuan. Right and wrong were inverted, and black and white were in extreme chaos. Even the long-term 1996 bonds recovered by 2.5 yuan. Therefore, the final market prices showed troop reduction up by about 80 cents, rehabilitation bonds up by 25 cents, 1921 Customs bonds and 1996 bonds down by only 1 to 20 cents, and issues after the 20th issue down by 3.6 to 4.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Today's market prices will likely experience very large changes. The total trading volume is estimated to be around 40 to 50 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Initially, the Assassination Telegram Caused a Sharp Decline, Followed by a Rise Due to Increased Tender Prices</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced sharp declines and advances, and the situation remained turbulent. Market sentiment was chaotic and inconsistent. Initially, news of President Wang's assassination in Nanjing caused market tremors and a surge in selling pressure, leading to an immediate sharp decline in prices. In the afternoon, the market turned higher, with the pace quickening due to large purchases by a certain bank under a code name. Rumors of rising tender prices and currency inflation intensified, and the market rebounded. However, actual demand remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Tender Prices Fell in the Morning and Recovered in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market, prices for all months fell consistently due to a noticeable reversal in the rising trend of tender prices. Market sentiment weakened, and the number of buyers on the floor decreased, with some long positions closing out and prices falling. However, securities firms engaged in aggressive buying, purchasing large amounts, which helped maintain market prices. Prices recovered by several cents in the second session. In the third session, rumors suddenly emerged, and news of the assassination spread, causing a major shock to the market. Selling pressure intensified, and prices plummeted. As a result, prices for all months fell by 3.6 to 5.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices.</p>
<p>The market suddenly reversed and turned higher at the opening of the afternoon session. The situation became tense, with reports that tender prices had fallen to a low of 1107 yuan in the morning and then jumped back to over 1150 yuan in the afternoon. Rumors of currency inflation became more prevalent, and the code-named bank resumed buying activities. The market became short of supply, and prices continued to rise. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2.7 to 3.9 yuan compared to the morning's closing prices.</p>
<p>The sold brands were Mingde (1450 bales), He Xing (1450 bales), Shen Ji (1550 bales), Ren Feng (2000 bales), Run Kang (2450 bales), Da Ji (850 bales), and Yu Da (1100 bales).

<p>The cotton market experienced a sharp decline in the morning and a recovery in the afternoon, with prices fluctuating up and down. The market situation was extremely chaotic. Initially, there were signs of a reversal in the rising gold prices, and rumors about the political situation were rampant, leading to a sharp decline in prices. In the afternoon, the code-named bank resumed aggressive buying, and the buying pressure was particularly strong, causing the market to rebound.</p>
<p>The Code-Named Bank Purchased Cotton</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, prices for all months trended downward consistently. This was mainly due to concerns about a potential reversal after days of sharp increases, and the decline in tender prices also dampened market sentiment. There were more sellers, and prices trended downward. By the close of the morning session, selling pressure intensified due to reports of a serious assassination attempt on a prominent figure, and tender prices plummeted to 1107 yuan. A sudden surge of sellers appeared, and the downward momentum was sharp. As a result, prices for near-term contracts fell by 90 cents, and prices for far-term contracts fell by 2.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The market experienced a rapid change at the opening of the afternoon session, and buying interest suddenly became strong. A certain bank made large purchases, and the code-named bank continued to aggressively buy, purchasing 15,500 bales. Prices rose gradually, and it was said that rising tender prices were favorable to long positions, and the rumors were booming, further strengthening the buying pressure. As a result, prices for all months rose by 50 cents to 2.5 yuan compared to the morning's closing prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trading on the US cotton market was light, with most activity focused on switching contracts. Initially, there was hesitation among traders due to hedging activity.

<h3 id="e135">Grains: Flour and Wheat Plunge Together, Grain Exchange Suspends Trading Before Noon Due to Margin Calls <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Auction of Foreign-Owned Sesame Seeds Today</p>
<p>There was a huge change in flour market opening prices this morning. Initially, foreign wheat prices rebounded by 30 cents, and the market consensus was still bullish. It was naturally easy for the market to become agitated. As a result, the opening price for this month was as high as 96 cents. However, seeing this high price, the market immediately turned downward. The opening price fell to 92.5 cents. Although the opening price for long-term contracts was good, with an increase of only 2-3 cents compared to the end of the previous month, by the third session, due to the news of President Wang's assassination and the sharp fall in the gold market, market sentiment was in chaos, and prices for all months plunged. By the close of trading, prices for all months had fallen by about 10 cents compared to the opening. Approximately one million bags were traded in half a day.</p>
<p>When trading resumed in the afternoon, prices recovered by 5-6 cents due to short covering and continued buying by outside long positions. The opening price for March was 3.0775 yuan, but the closing price also fell to 3.01 yuan. Going forward, the political situation may cause further turmoil.</p>

<p>The wheat market did not open until the afternoon because the exchange repeatedly delayed trading due to margin calls. Market sentiment was unusually cold, and trading was not very active. Initially, the market was calm due to rising foreign wheat prices. However, due to the sharp fall in the flour market and the confirmed news of President Wang's assassination, buying interest was weak, and many long positions closed out. Prices for all months plunged, especially long-term contracts, with near-term contracts falling by 4-5 cents and long-term contracts falling by more than 10 cents. It is expected that future volatility is inevitable due to the unstable national situation.</p>
<p>In addition, the Grain Exchange will begin auctioning foreign-owned sesame seeds today, with prices quoted per 100-jin load using the Sima scale.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Domestic and Foreign Rice Prices Rise Together <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than twenty domestic rice boats arrived. Market conditions, buoyed by rising confidence, led to a sharp increase in prices. Retail activity was very active. Indica rice prices rose by 30-40 cents, and new japonica rice prices rose by 40-50 cents. Merchants purchased a total of 400-500 bags.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the northern rice market was affected by soaring flour prices and active purchases, while the four villages were busy with agricultural work, resulting in weak shipments. Only about 30 boats arrived at the river docks. Shop inventories were low, and morning trading was very good, with prices increasing by 30-40 cents. Although shop sentiment weakened later, the river docks' inventories were gradually depleted, leading to a sharp increase of 40-60 cents for new japonica rice. Yangbu tip rice also rose by 40-50 cents, Dujian rice rose by 20-30 cents, Yaocong tip rice rose by 30-40 cents, and Baiyuan rice also rose by 10-20 cents. Prices of other rice varieties followed suit, rising by 20-30 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was strong interest in the Indica rice market. Morning trading was still active. However, after the news of President Wang's assassination was published in the newspapers, buyers mostly waited and watched. As a result, transactions were not as active as in previous days. However, demand from Tianjin was still strong. A total of 1572 bags of Ningbo, Ji, Wan, and Liu Indica rice were sold on the market, along with dozens of bags of Taizhou rice. Ningbo and Hubei white rice were also purchased by local retailers. Therefore, Ningbo rice continued to rise by 20 cents. As merchants waited and watched in the afternoon, the market turned flat. A total of 1300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2000 bags of Ningbo rice, 73 bags of Taizhou rice, 976 bags of Hankou rice, 1000 bags of Guangdong rice, and 250 bags of Hangzhou rice were sold throughout the day. With the exception of shipments to Tianjin, only 300-400 bags were sold to retailers, while the rest were purchased by merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign rice stocks were low, and old inventories were being held back. New inventories were highly sought after, and market transactions were increasingly quiet. Yesterday, 300 bags of old Wulong rice and 200 bags of Siamese Yuan rice were repurchased by local merchants. Prices also rose by about 10 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e137">World Tennis Star Ko Hin Performs in Canton <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Combining Intelligence and Skill to Reach Perfection, Chinese and Western Audiences Alike Exclaim in Awe</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Guangzhou) World-renowned professional tennis player Ko Hin recently toured the East. He arrived in the Philippines at the end of last month and began competing against the top Filipino tennis players on the second of this month. Mr. Ko won all seven matches, completely subduing the Filipino tennis champions. The entire Philippines was filled with admiration. After the competitions in the Philippines, Mr. Ko, despite having defeated the Philippine tennis champion Aragan, greatly admired Aragan's skill. He invited Aragan, along with the Filipino tennis talent Gavias, to travel to Sydney, Australia. At the same time, he invited Shanghai's professional tennis player Cavanaugh to meet in Hong Kong to prepare for departure. Mr. Ko and his party of three arrived in Hong Kong on the 25th aboard the President McKinley. In response to an invitation from the Guangzhou Municipal Sports Association, they will hold exhibition matches and visit the construction projects in Guangdong Province. After resting in Hong Kong for a day, they took a Hong Kong steamer to Guangzhou on the evening of the 26th, arriving in Guangzhou on the morning of the 27th. In the morning, they toured the famous sites of Guangzhou and visited various construction projects. Afterwards, they attended a welcome reception hosted by the Municipal Sports Association. Consuls from various countries stationed in Guangdong, as well as overseas Chinese from countries such as France, England, and Germany, enthusiastically attended the event, making it an unprecedented grand gathering in international social events. This was because people from various countries had long admired Mr. Ko's reputation and considered it fortunate to witness Mr. Ko's brilliance and appreciate his tennis skills.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Spectacle The competition took place at the tennis court of the Municipal Sports Association in Central Park at 3 p.m. this afternoon. Three matches were scheduled, with the first and second matches being singles, and the third match being doubles. Tickets were divided into three categories: one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. After noon, ticket buyers entered the venue in an endless stream. In front of the Sports Association, carriages and horses were bustling, and Chinese and Western ladies were shoulder to shoulder, extremely crowded. Before 3 p.m., tickets were already sold out. Those who arrived later stood behind the seats, and those who watched from afar outside the venue were no less than a thousand people.</p>
<p>Mr. Ko Takes the Stage At precisely 3 p.m., the referees took the stage. First, Aragan (Philippines) and Cavanaugh (Shanghai) competed in a singles match. Aragan was energetic, experienced, and had superior skills, defeating Cavanaugh with a score of six to one. The first match was still a singles match. French Ko Hin appeared amidst the applause and cheers of the audience. Reporters from various countries rushed forward to take photos of Mr. Ko. He had a prominent nose and deep-set eyes, possessing a calm mind, and at first glance, he was known as a famous general with both intelligence and skill. His opponent was the German, Bin Diga, an overseas Chinese in Guangdong (a rising star in Guangzhou's tennis world).</p>
<p>World Professional Tennis Player Ko Hin Performs in Guangzhou (Left: Mr. Ko; Right: German Bao Diga)</p>
<p>Supernatural Skill After the start of the match, Ko Hin performed brilliantly, repeatedly trapping Bao Diga. His blocking, drawing, and pressing of the ball all had unique advantages. Sometimes, he used light wrists to send the ball over the net, leaving the opponent unable to reach it in time. Sometimes, he used lightning-fast strokes, the ball was fast and powerful, making the opponent unable to defend. His one-handed operation was unpredictable. In tense moments, the opponent ran all over the court, struggling to parry, while Mr. Ko faced it calmly, standing like Mount Tai, moving like a startled rabbit. Even if the opponent had dangerous and urgent balls, he could still handle them with ease. Mr. Ko was not only known for his ball skills, but also often spotted the opponent's weaknesses, taking advantage of flaws and gaps, using the ball magically. He truly had both "skill" and "intelligence." His opponent Bao Diga was not weak either, but when he met Mr. Ko, it was like a small witch seeing a great witch. In half an hour of hard fighting, he lost to Ko Hin with a score of six to three.</p>
<p>Doubles Performance The third match was a doubles exhibition match. Aragan (Philippines) and Gavias (Philippines) formed a team, while Ko Hin cooperated with Bao Diga. They played a total of three sets. In the first set, Ko Hin served, winning every point, with a score of six to two. In the second set, Aragan was young and brave, shaking his spirits and adopting an offensive, winning back a set with a score of six to three. In the third set, Ko's team gradually weakened. After Bao Diga fought hard against Ko Hin in the previous match, he was already exhausted. Cooperating with Ko Hin again, his strength was even more unsustainable. On the contrary, Aragan took advantage of his remaining courage, launching wave after wave of attacks. At this time, Ko Hin repeatedly used his volleying skills to pull back a few points, but he could not support it alone. Aragan's team then won the third set with a score of six to three. In the doubles summary, Aragan's team finally won.</p>
<p>Leaving Canton for Hong Kong It was already 6 p.m. in the afternoon, and dusk was approaching. The audience then cheered and dispersed. In the evening, the Municipal Sports Association hosted a banquet for Ko Hin and the Philippine athletes. Ko and others left Canton for Hong Kong on the 28th. From the 28th to the 30th, there will be exhibition matches at the Kowloon Ball Club in Hong Kong every afternoon at 3 p.m. At the beginning of next month, they will take a British postal ship to Australia. (Evening of October 27)</p>

<p>Begins Tomorrow, Deadline on the 20th</p>
<p>The Municipal No. 1 Public Stadium's 7th Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Competition has now finalized its regulations. Registration for old members will begin on the 3rd of this month and end on the 20th. After the registration deadline, if there are any remaining slots, they will be supplemented by new member registrations. Due to the limited venue, it is feared that there will be no way to manage if there are too many teams. There are also the following restrictions on the registration of old members: (1) The qualifications of old members are limited to the football teams that participated in the last (6th) competition; (2) Teams that participated in the last competition and have fewer than ten old players will not be considered old members; (3) Teams that participated in the last competition and forfeited twice will not be entitled to registration; (4) Teams or players who participated in the last competition and insulted the referee, showed animosity towards the opposing team, or committed fraudulent acts will not be entitled to registration; (5) Players who participated in the last competition and are enrolled in school or are employed as physical education teachers will not be entitled to registration; (6) The registration of each team's players is limited to sixteen people. If the number of old players is insufficient, new players may be added to supplement the team, but the number of supplemented players may not exceed six people. Supplemented players must be non-students and not employed as physical education professionals. As for the registration procedures, registration forms can be obtained from the association, filled out in detail, and accompanied by a six-inch photo of all players. If there are any omissions, individual photos should be added. It is also heard that this year's competition will be quite strict. Any barbaric behavior, intentional harm to opponents, and refusal to obey the referee's decisions will result in the disqualification of the entire team from the competition.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Education Actively Improving Medical Education <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Establishing a Special Committee to Unify Authority</p>
<p>In addition to frequently sending commissioners and inspectors and occasionally sending section chiefs to various provinces and cities to conduct on-site inspections and guidance, the Ministry of Education's inspection of medical education in the past was always based on temporary requests to experts for inspection (such as Pang Jingzhou, etc.). Unlike sending a ministerial commissioner, the inspection time and duration were inevitably somewhat difficult (temporary requests were based on courtesy, and the individuals requested all had other work and could not therefore neglect their original careers for long. If the Ministry of Education encountered urgent inspection matters, it had no staff members and it was more inconvenient to ask people). Furthermore, those who handled medical education in the Ministry on a regular basis were all doing it on a part-time basis, with no specific responsibility. Therefore, in addition to establishing two specialized committees for midwifery education and nursing education under the original Ministry of Education Medical Education Committee based on the resolutions of the Medical Education Committee, the Ministry of Education also changed the Elementary and Secondary School Health Education Design Committee to be under the Medical Education Committee, unifying authority in order to connect and communicate and facilitate progress. Normally, the Ministry of Education has several committees for medical education, and Zhu Zhanggeng and Nie Yuchan, etc., regularly work in the ministry, so their responsibilities are more specific and things are easier to accomplish. The Ministry of Education had previously sent personnel to inspect hospitals, midwifery schools, nursing schools and colleges, and an assistant training class in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai provinces and cities. Now, it is continuing to send personnel to inspect other provinces and cities. Now we see the Department of Orders assigning Yang Chongrui to inspect the midwifery school in Guangdong Province, and the Department of Orders has instructed the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education to inform them.</p>

<p>Jinling Women's University in Nanjing was founded in 1915. In 1930, it was renamed Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the only women's higher education institution in central China. Since its founding, it has been 20 years. A grand commemorative ceremony was held today. At the same time, because Mrs. De Benkang, the founder of the school, is celebrating her 60th birthday, the graduates of the school returned to the school one after another to celebrate Mrs. De's birthday at noon today. At 3:30 p.m., a 20th anniversary celebration was held. In addition to the administrative chief's training speech, President Sun Zhesheng of the Legislative Yuan and President Luo Jialun of the Central University were invited to speak. Furthermore, the school authorities, believing that most of the graduating students are working in various middle schools, and this gathering is a rare opportunity, held a secondary education discussion meeting for the benefit of the students, and invited the principals of various middle schools in Nanjing to participate. The time was from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. today, and Mr. Liao Maoru, Ai Xizhou, and others were invited to speak. Tomorrow morning, President Zhang Boling of Nankai University will be invited to speak. In the afternoon, the annual meeting of the alumni association will be held. The day after tomorrow morning, the graduating students will visit the new construction of the capital. In the afternoon, the secondary education discussion meeting will continue, and there will be a celebration entertainment party in the evening, which can be called a grand event.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers (II) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yan Yin</p>
<p>(Speech given to secondary school students nationwide on October 25th)</p>
<p>(II) Speaking from the perspective of elementary school teachers themselves, the responsibilities they bear are extremely significant. Our Master Mencius said, "To live in ease without education is akin to being an animal." The American educator Thorndike also said, "If young children never come into contact with adults and are not influenced by adult educational activities, then after twenty years, the majority of these children will die from smallpox, jaundice, malaria, and various epidemics. The remaining people will be unable to speak, ignorant of etiquette, and unable to use tools. Their lives will be little different from monkeys." It is evident that education is necessary, and education is a necessary method for continuing human civilization. Moreover, due to the pursuit of survival and comfort by humanity, everything is progressing "ceaselessly." Education is also a necessary method for teaching humanity to pursue benefits (the benefits of the masses) and avoid harm, and to advance civilization day by day. It not only continues the existing civilization but also "reforms the old and establishes the new," improving and promoting the existing civilization, and growing continuously. This is speaking from the perspective of general human civilization. Furthermore, considering the specific environment of a particular country, education is also essential for a country or nation to develop or survive in the world. The prosperity of imperialist countries is not solely reliant on the financial capital of a few capitalists; it is necessary to educate the majority of their people to believe that they are a "superior race," surpassing all so-called barbaric or semi-civilized peoples. It is necessary to educate the people to build a "Roman Empire," or a "Third Reich," or to fight desperately for the "Yamato spirit," for the so-called "lifeline of Japan," killing without batting an eye and plundering colonies and opening up resources without hesitation. Imperialist education has contributed to the prosperity of imperialism. Therefore, Germany's victory over France and Japan's victory over Germany are both attributed to elementary school teachers. Thus, in this economically depressed world, where most industries are almost at a standstill, elementary school education in Germany, Italy, and Japan has not been halted; on the contrary, it is valued even more than before. The impact on the treatment of elementary school teachers is also very small. Conversely, semi-colonial countries, such as our country and Abyssinia, have suffered from the lack of developed education. The physical strength of the people is weak, their knowledge is insufficient, and their will is not firm. Therefore, they cannot defeat imperialism in war. Hence, during the Sino-Japanese War, many traitors were used by the Japanese military. Therefore, when Italian troops entered Abyssinia, many Abyssinian tribes surrendered to the Italian army. In a period of severe national crisis, if we want to save ourselves from danger and revive the nation, the fundamental solution still relies on education and on elementary school teachers bearing the great responsibility. To continue and advance human civilization, or to save ourselves from danger and revive the nation, this cannot be accomplished by casual elementary school teachers who simply teach books all day long. Elementary school teachers must have heart, courage, perseverance, and methods to take on such a heavy responsibility. If elementary school teachers are to have heart, courage, perseverance, and methods, how can they not cultivate themselves? Even if we disregard the nation, speaking solely from the perspective of personal life, if elementary school teachers act casually and do not cultivate themselves, they will become sluggish, too far removed from the modern world, and will naturally fall behind and inevitably head towards the grave. We see many elementary school teachers who have worked as teachers for two or three decades and remain unknown, not only unable to "keep pace with the times" but also becoming "rigid" in everything, with everything out of step with the times. We also see many elementary school teachers who distinguish themselves, not only absorbing all that is new but also constantly making new contributions, spreading within the elementary school education community and influencing elementary school education in a locality or a nation. The division between these two types of elementary school teachers is due to one not pursuing further study while the other diligently studies and improves themselves. Of course, among the elementary school teachers who distinguish themselves, there are also those who are "purely stealing a reputation," but the majority have achieved success through the solid foundation gained from cultivation. Someone conducted a rough survey to investigate children's inclinations towards elementary school teachers. The results showed that the teachers most loved by children are those who are "knowledgeable and excellent," "skilled in teaching methods," "of noble character," and "enthusiastic in their work." Based on these inclinations, it can be seen that elementary school teachers must cultivate themselves if they want to be loved by their students.</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about the methods of self-cultivation for elementary school teachers. The methods of self-cultivation for elementary school teachers can be divided into several points:</p>
<p>(I) Ideological Aspect: Elementary school teachers should have a firm and unwavering "belief," believing that human civilization will definitely move forward, believing that people should seek welfare for the majority, believing that imperialism and all evil forces that harm the majority will inevitably collapse one day, and that the "light" of the world will surely replace "darkness" and rise up. They must also have a thorough understanding of what kind of citizens are needed for present-day China and firmly believe that even if the country is destroyed, elementary school teachers can still cultivate useful citizens for the purpose of revival. How can such a belief be successfully cultivated? It is necessary to read more new books about world knowledge and social sciences on the one hand, and pay attention to the international situation, the cut-and-dried and dark aspects of society on the other hand, and study philosophy to understand the meaning of life and determine one's "outlook on life." In this way, education will have a center and will not be like "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night," and everything can be handled with ease, and teaching materials and methods can be readily available.</p>
<p>(II) Character Aspect: Elementary school teachers should be clear about their own personalities. If they feel that they are too impatient, they must cultivate patience. If they feel that they are too slow, they must practice being quick and efficient in their work. When children oppose them, they should investigate the reasons and deal with them carefully, without losing their temper with the children. If they hear children say disrespectful things about them, they should not take it too seriously or put on airs of "the teacher is strict, and the Way is esteemed." When busy, they should not be negligent, and even less should they be easily impulsive and angry. When tired, they should not be afraid of trouble, anxious, or resentful of children. When sick, they should also restrain their temper. This is the method of cultivating patience. Prepare more in advance to avoid temporary haste, and practice diligently to improve your work efficiency. This is the method of practicing speed. The qualities needed by elementary school teachers, such as "sincerity," "compassion," "fair judgment," and "adaptability," are discussed in detail in various educational books. As for the methods of cultivating these qualities, they cannot be achieved solely by reading educational books. It is necessary to constantly experience things oneself, reflect on oneself, record one's shortcomings, or listen to others' criticisms, and strive to correct one's faults and do good. Reading biographies of educators is also an effective way to cultivate character.</p>
<p>(III) Physical Aspect: Elementary school teachers' work is extremely busy, and their responsibilities are extremely heavy. Naturally, they should maintain a healthy body. Everyone who is an elementary school teacher knows about health preservation methods, and there is no need for others to say more. However, everyone often neglects and slacks off and does not implement them. I believe that if the methods are too complicated, they will naturally be difficult to implement. If they are to be implemented, simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods must be adopted and practiced regularly. I think that if you choose a sport that you enjoy and do it regularly, it will definitely be beneficial to your body. When all the children in the school are doing morning exercises, if the teachers join in, it will also have a great impact on their physical well-being. As for restrictive methods such as regulating diet and abstaining from smoking and alcohol, if you are determined to practice them, you will definitely be able to do so.</p>
<p>(IV) Knowledge Aspect: Elementary school teachers' knowledge should have two aspects: one is their basic knowledge, and the other is the knowledge applied in teaching. The method of increasing knowledge is to read more books on the one hand and to attend school or receive tutoring from famous teachers on the other hand. The method of reading books is to select several books, such as educational books and newspapers, books related to the subjects you teach, and books that you like to read. Set a schedule, create a form, and read step by step, annotating and summarizing as you go. If you can gather a group of people to organize a reading group, with each person reading separately and then reporting their findings at a certain time for everyone to study and discuss, then it will be more economical and effective than if each person reads individually. When attending summer school, summer training courses, or receiving tutoring from famous teachers, you should first examine your own shortcomings and needs, choose courses accordingly, and study hard. What books should elementary school teachers read? Many educational books have lists of recommended books, but we must carefully select a portion of these lists to read to avoid wasting effort and reading too many useless books.</p>
<p>(V) Skills Aspect: In addition to basic skills, elementary school teachers should also have teaching skills. The most important of the basic skills is the in-depth study of the skills related to the subjects they teach. If they can deeply study the skills related to the subjects they teach, they will have ample talent for teaching, not be flustered, and be able to demonstrate correctly and effectively. For example, writing, drawing, crafts, home economics, farming, industry, chemical and physical experiments, etc. If their own skills are not sufficient, how can they be competent and happy in the subjects they teach? Teaching skills include teaching methods, including "teaching attitude," "teaching voice," "ability to manage," "questioning method," "homework guidance method," "ability to cope," and "examination method," etc. Most of these are not easy to read about in books but must be personally experienced and tried. The methods to improve teaching skills are: (1) Self-reflection, which means always paying attention to one's own shortcomings and thinking about how to improve them. It is best to have a "self-reflection table," listing the skills that elementary school teachers should have one by one and including the percentage that each item should account for so that you can check yourself. These types of teacher self-reflection tables or teacher self-reflection standards can be found in various practical education books and do not need to be discussed further here. (2) Participating in research conferences to study issues related to teaching methods allows you to hear good opinions from others for your own reference and imitation. (3) Observing other people's teaching can also teach you many tricks. (4) Innovation and experimentation, which is the most important method for improving teaching skills. Try out good methods proposed by others and then research and modify them to create new methods, or if you feel that the methods you are implementing are not very effective, then think of a new method to try out and then research and modify it to create newer methods. In short, by working hard on your own and learning from others, your teaching skills will improve day by day.</p>
<p>The above are all about the personal self-cultivation methods of elementary school teachers. In addition, if education administrative authorities or elementary school principals want elementary school teachers' knowledge and skills to improve continuously, they should supervise elementary school teachers' further study, run summer schools, and force elementary school teachers to enroll. Issuing educational publications that study teaching methods, or designating certain educational books and forcing elementary school teachers to read them, is also a method. Organizing research conferences to guide elementary school teachers to attend research, is also a method. Furthermore, hiring experts, such as people who speak Mandarin fluently, musicians, and people with various skills, and using the method of circulating instruction to teach the teachers in each school to enhance the various skills of the teachers, is also a very effective method. Not every teacher can work hard on their own; many people still need to be urged by external forces. Therefore, education administrative authorities or elementary school principals must also pay close attention to the question of how to urge teachers to pursue further study.</p>
<p>Judging from the actual situation of elementary school education at present, elementary school teachers are extremely busy, working all day long without even time to rest, so where is there time for self-cultivation? Therefore, I also thought that if we really want elementary school teachers to cultivate themselves, the education administrative agencies should reduce the various work of elementary school teachers, especially the work of grading papers, which must be reduced to a minimum. Elementary school teachers themselves must also find ways to economize time, reducing papers and homework to a minimum, and assigning some of the work of grading papers to outstanding students to assist.</p>
<p>This speech of mine is all old news, but it may be helpful to normal school students who aspire to be good teachers. I hope you pay attention. As for how normal school students should cultivate themselves while they are normal school students, that is not within the scope of this issue, but I very much hope that you "learn to race horses before marrying," change your mentality of wanting to do great things in a vast world, do not despise practical work, and pay more attention to elementary school curriculum standards and other books and courses that elementary school teachers really need. First, figure out</p>

<p>—No Need to Use Inverting Vacuum Tubes—</p>
<p>(I) Reasons for Not Needing Inverting (Reversed Phase) Vacuum Tubes:</p>
<p>In an amplifier tube, the grid input voltage and the plate current are in the same phase (Same Phase). Therefore, it is in exactly the opposite phase to the plate output voltage. The so-called inverting vacuum tube is for this function.</p>
<p>Let us first observe the relationship between the voltage generated at the plate and the voltage generated at the filament: When the input voltage supplied to the grid is positive, the plate current increases and the plate voltage decreases, that is, the output voltage changes to negative. But the filament voltage increases instead, and the filament output voltage changes to positive. Therefore, the voltages generated at the plate and the filament are in exactly opposite phases.</p>
<p>Now, if the filament and plate ends are properly inserted into the grids of the push-pull tubes, the push-pull action can be easily completed without the need for an inverting tube.</p>
<p>(II) Connection Circuit: As shown in the first figure, the upper part is the ordinary resistance-coupled circuit. The difference is that, similar to the plate circuit, a load resistor is inserted in the filament circuit of the first vacuum tube, and its upper end is connected to the other tube of the push-pull circuit.</p>
<p>The vacuum tubes used are the No. 57 tube as the voltage amplifier tube, and the No. 45 or super No. 45 tube as the output tube. The reason for using triodes here is to make the sound reproduction accurate and to avoid odd harmonic distortion (especially third harmonic distortion).</p>
<p>Points to note on wiring:</p>
<p>(1) Connection of the negative grid resistor and the bypass capacitor of the No. 57 tube:</p>
<p>The capacitor inserted in parallel with the negative grid resistor cannot be grounded at one end as usual in this case, because if it is grounded, the load resistor will be short-circuited. Therefore, it must be inserted at both ends of the load resistor. If the bypass capacitor is not inserted, and no other load resistor is inserted, but the negative grid resistor itself is used as the load, it can work, although not perfectly.</p>
<p>(2) Load resistor inserted in the filament circuit:</p>
<p>The values of the signal voltages generated at the filament load and the plate load must be equal, and their phases must be opposite. Although the plate and filament are easily affected by the screen grid current, etc., it is usually sufficient to use loads with the same resistance value.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Experimental Ultra-Shortwave Oscillator <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Meng</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce one or two simple and easy-to-experiment ultra-shortwave oscillators. The first figure shows the structure of the entire machine, and the second figure is its circuit diagram. The maximum capacity of the tuning capacitor is 16-20 unfd. It is quite suitable to use three ordinary small capacitors. The oscillator tube can be either a No. 71 tube (5v.) or a No. 45 tube (2.5v.). The .o5ufd bypass capacitor in the filament circuit must be inserted. If it is not inserted, the vacuum tube will inevitably burn out.</p>
<p>For amplitude modulation, the secondary line of the push-pull audio frequency transformer is inserted into the plate circuit, and a buzzer and telegraph key are connected to one end of the primary line, and the other end is connected to the output of the audio frequency two-stage amplifier to perform amplitude modulation. In this way, it is possible to transmit telegraph or telephone without using a separate vacuum tube. The B voltage is supplied at 150-200V.</p>
<p>The above device is not a problem if it is only used for the study of ordinary oscillators. However, if it is actually used for communication with the outside world, it cannot be used because its oscillation frequency is extremely prone to change, often leading to a state where it cannot be received. To prevent this, the oscillation method should be changed to push-pull. The third figure shows its structure, and its circuit is shown in the fourth figure. The vacuum tube is still the former one, while the capacitor and others are slightly different from the former one. The variable capacitor can be a dual-gang with five or seven plates. It is better to use thick copper wire for the coil.</p>
<p>L1 diameter 6 inches 1 turn</p>
<p>L2 diameter 1 inch 4 turns</p>
<p>Choke diameter 1 inch 18 turns</p>
<p>When performing amplitude modulation, use the constant current amplitude modulation method. According to experiments, this machine can reach a distance of about K.M. without using an antenna. Whether the transmitter is oscillating can be determined by using a coil of the same size as the tuning coil to connect an annual red lamp to resonate with the coil of the transmitter. If the transmitter is oscillating, the annual red lamp will light up; if it is not oscillating, it will not light up.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Improvement of High-Frequency Coils <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Jian</p>
<p>The coil shown in the figure is made by improving the winding method of the antenna coil and the tuning coil. As shown in the figure, the tuning coil 2 is wound on the insulating cylinder 1. However, when winding, the two ends of 2, that is, the grid section 2' and the ground section 2", must be tightly wound, and the central section 2" must be wound especially sparsely. Also, at the joint 2', the antenna coil and the coil of 2 are alternately wound for five to seven-fourths of a turn. The antenna coil is not grounded. In the figure, 4 is the regenerative coil. If 2 and 3 are wound alternately, it is easy to cause capacitive coupling. Therefore, the number of antenna coil turns can be reduced. Also, because the center of the tuning coil is wound sparsely, the distributed capacitance between the windings can be reduced. This improved winding method is quite applicable.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Self-Generating Radio <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, a vacuum tube radio is installed in a box, and a lever-type motor (3) with a handle (6) is also installed in the same box. Its output rotary shaft (8) is connected to a magnet generator (4), and the electricity generated by this generator is supplied to the radio (2). The so-called motor (3) here is just like the motor used in a gramophone. By rotating the handle, considerable power is stored. The previous radios were either mains-powered or battery-powered. The former is not easy to use if there is no power line or during a power outage, and the latter is quite expensive and heavy. Both have inconveniences, but this self-generating radio does not have the above inconveniences and can be used everywhere. (From Wireless and Experiment Magazine)</p>
<h3 id="e158">Simple Superheterodyne Three-Tube Radio (Continued from Issue 138) <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>(I) Simple Circuit: The circuit of this machine is extremely simple, using three of the 30 vacuum tubes that every researcher has. The circuit is similar to that of ordinary three-tube machines, so it is very suitable for beginners to assemble.</p>
<p>(II) High Selectivity: This machine is a superheterodyne, so its selectivity is very good. All radio stations in Shanghai can be completely distinguished without any mixing.</p>
<p>(III) High Sensitivity: The sensitivity of this machine is quite excellent. Although it only has three tubes, all radio stations in Shanghai can be listened to in the loudspeaker without any omission. The volume is slightly lower than that of ordinary tube machines.</p>
<p>In summary, this machine is well worth a try, and the cost is minimal. You can try out the superheterodyne circuit and get a practical radio. Why not do it? The method of making the whole machine is recorded below:</p>
<p>LL1 is a high-frequency transformer. It can be wound on a large spiderweb board with 26-gauge wire: L1 10 turns, L 10 turns.</p>
<p>Use a thin wooden stick to string the coil in the middle, separated by a copper sheet. Each coil is one inch away from the copper sheet. This is the end of the reading. When using, the lower end of the copper sheet can be folded into a right angle and installed on the bottom plate. The bottom plate is then grounded (see figure).</p>
<p>Prepare all the other parts and then you can start assembling.</p>
<p>L2L3 These two coils are the intermediate frequency transformer. The quality of this component really affects the performance of the whole machine, so do not be sloppy when manufacturing it. Use wood to turn two wooden cores of the same size (dimensions as shown in the figure), and then wind 800 turns of 26-gauge single-strand wire on each wooden core. Those who have assembled one or two vacuum tube radios will not fail. However, be very careful when calibrating. The most important thing is that when calibrating C2C3 to the loudest sound, do not move them anymore, and make the short-wave and long-wave radio stations have an average volume. Only then is the position of C2 and C3 correct. In normal use, turn CC1 with both hands at the same time. The numbers on the dials of C and C1 are approximately ten degrees apart. If you can use a dual-gang capacitor, the adjustment can be more convenient, but you must use small padding capacitors, and the calibration is also not easy, so a single one is used here.

<h3 id="e159">Supply of Voltages to the Various Electrodes of a Vacuum Tube <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Tingzhen</p>
<p>(I) Filament or Heater</p>
<p>Although vacuum tubes allow for slight changes in the voltage and current of the filament or heater during design, the specified values must be used for high efficiency. If the voltage used is lower than specified, the temperature of the cathode will also be low, resulting in limiting the emission of electrons, making the work of the vacuum tube unsuitable, and thus reducing its life. If the voltage used is higher than specified, the substances on the cathode will easily evaporate, which can also reduce its life. Therefore, to maintain the perfection of the vacuum tube, the voltage of the filament or heater must be checked with a voltmeter when the radio is turned on. If the filaments are connected in series, an ammeter can be connected in the filament circuit to correct its current.</p>
<p>The filament or heater can be supplied with direct current (battery or DC power supply) or alternating current. Usually, when using direct current, a resistor (variable or fixed) can be used to adjust the voltage. When using alternating current, a step-down transformer can be used to supply the voltage of the filament or heater. However, for radios that use both AC and DC, the filaments are connected in series with a step-down resistor, which can be directly plugged into the power line.</p>
<p>If the direct current filament or heater is supplied with dry batteries, a variable resistor should be connected in series between the filament and the battery to control the change in the battery. It is best to install an accurate voltmeter or milliampere meter in the radio so that the filament of the vacuum tube can obtain a specified voltage. The voltage of the battery often changes when it is stopped, so using a resistor can also serve as a switch to stop it. If sometimes using storage batteries or air batteries or DC power supplies, appropriate fixed resistors can be used. It is best to use a voltmeter or ammeter to calibrate for the first time. If the vacuum tube uses two volts, a storage battery can be directly connected in series. If the vacuum tube uses 6.3 volts, a 6-volt storage battery can be directly connected in series without using a resistor.</p>
<p>The size of the filament or heater resistance in parallel can be calculated using Ohm's law:</p>
<p>If the radio uses three No. 32 tubes, two No. 30 tubes, and two No. 31 tubes connected to dry batteries, then the series resistance is equal to 3 volts (using two dry batteries in series) minus 2 volts (the specified voltage of the vacuum tube) divided by 0.56 amperes (the sum of 5xo.o6o amperes and 2xo.i3o amperes). The answer is approximately 1.8 ohms, so resistors of 2 to 3 ohms can also be used, but it is best to purchase resistors with a larger number of ohms, because most of the electrical power is consumed on the resistor. If resistors with a larger number of ohms are used, they will not overheat and be damaged. The calculation of electrical power (unit: watt) is: the sum of the filament current multiplied by the voltage drop of the resistor, which is 6 watts. Since the number of watts is so small, general commercial resistors can be used. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Special Publication for the 20th Anniversary of Ginling Women's Arts and Science College</p>
<h3 id="e161">Foreword <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Time flies, and this school has been established for twenty years. In the past twenty years, from imitating pioneers and building with difficulty, it has gradually reached its present scale. Whether this school has made considerable contributions to women's higher education can be generally understood through its annual development and growth. However, reviewing the past is a strategy for the future, especially given the country's difficulties. This school seeks to adapt to the needs of the times and must continue to seek progress. Therefore, it briefly describes the current situation and future plans, seeking guidance from those who are knowledgeable, which is also the school's long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Higher education is related to the rise and fall of national culture and bears a heavy responsibility. It is definitely not something that can be perfected by the wisdom of a few people. This school has always received enthusiastic care and assistance from people in society. On the occasion of its twentieth anniversary, it presents a brief overview, which, in addition to being included in the school's journal, is also briefly presented in this space. It is deeply grateful for the encouraging words given by the administrative officers and those enthusiastic about education. It hereby expresses its gratitude and hopes that people in society will continue to provide assistance and guidance with their usual enthusiasm, which would not only be the school's good fortune but also the nation's blessing.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Progress Over Twenty Years <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>This school was established in 1915. Time flies, and twenty years have passed. The past is like yesterday, and the annual growth and expansion are still vivid in my mind. On the occasion of this twentieth anniversary, I will recount a few things to inspire future development. For the sake of clarity, I have divided the narrative into three periods, as described below.</p>
<p>First Period – The Founding Period – 1915 to 1921</p>
<p>The Motivation for Founding Women's education in China, run by churches, began quite early. Church girls' schools in Ningbo, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, Nanjing, and other places had a history of thirty or forty years by the early Republic of China. Over time, the content also became more comprehensive. Therefore, in the summer of 1913, the principals of various church girls' middle schools along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River gathered to discuss further steps for women's education, based on two reasons. One was for the sake of graduation and further education, and the other was to alleviate the lack of teachers. The former was because there was no women's university in the country at that time, and ordinary universities were not open to women. Therefore, if female middle school graduates did not go abroad, they had no place to further their education. However, the cost of going abroad was very high, and only those from wealthy families could afford it. Moreover, middle school graduates were still young, and once they left home and went abroad, their understanding of the domestic situation was not yet clear, which was not the best option. Regarding the latter, each girls' school wanted to hire female teachers who had graduated from university, but there were no institutions in the country to train them, and women who returned from studying abroad were extremely rare and not easy to find. Due to the above two reasons, a proposal was made for further progress: the motivation to establish a women's university.</p>
<p>Preparations After the principals of various girls' middle schools made the proposal, they sought the consent of various churches, because at that time the standards and expectations for the proposed women's university were extremely high, and it was known that it could not be managed with the financial and human resources of one church alone. Subsequently, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church, the Baptist Church, the Christian Church, and other five denominations agreed. In November of that year, directors were elected and a board of directors was established. Therefore, this association commemorates November as the anniversary of its establishment because the board of directors was formed in that month. After the board of directors was established, Nanjing was chosen as the location for the school, and the school was named Ginling Women's University. Mrs. Lawrence Thurston was elected as president and was responsible for the preparations. Mrs. Thurston had the talent to run a school, and she planned and coordinated in various ways. Finally, preparations were completed in 1915, and enrollment began. Classes officially started in September of that year.</p>
<p>Opening Situation At the beginning of its opening, the scale was extremely small. At that time, the school building had not yet been built, and the Li family's residence in Embroidery Lane was rented. There were only nine students, coming from four provinces, who had graduated from six girls' middle schools. The number of faculty and staff was also nine, which was equal. Except for two people who held concurrent positions, the rest were full-time. It can be seen that the leaders did not neglect their studies because of the small number of students. This spirit was maintained throughout. The annual operating cost was 10,500 yuan, and the equipment was worth 3,772 yuan. Apart from the Encyclopedia Britannica, there were no other reference books.</p>
<p>Growth Situation In 1916, the second class of students was recruited, adding another nine students. Because one student from the first class dropped out, the total number of students in both classes was only seventeen. By the fourth year of operation, there were four classes of students, but the number was still only fifty-two. However, compared to the initial opening, the scope had increased, and there were twenty-three faculty and staff members. The London Missionary Society, the Anglican Church Missionary Society, and the United Methodist Church also joined in cooperation. Smith College in the United States also recognized this school as a sister school, and each year students and alumni of that school were responsible for a portion of the funding. Therefore, the foundation of this school became more solid at this time.</p>
<p>First Graduation In the summer of 1919, this school held its first graduation ceremony. There were only five graduates, and they were recognized by the State University of New York, which awarded them Bachelor of Arts degrees. Among the five graduates, two became teachers in national schools, two became teachers in church middle schools, and the other went to an American medical university to study medicine.</p>
<p>Second Period – The Expansion Period – 1921 to 1927</p>
<p>Purchasing Land and Building School Buildings During the years of 1920 and 1921, the seven Associated Women's Colleges in China, Japan, and India, run by various American churches, had a considerable foundation. In order to seek further progress, a major fundraising campaign was held to build school buildings. The alumnae of Smith College also helped with fundraising. Therefore, this school obtained a large amount of construction funds, purchased land in Taowu Valley, hired workers and materials, and started construction. By 1923, the Main Building, the Arts Building, the Science Building, and dormitories were gradually completed. The total cost of the land and construction was more than 900,000 silver dollars. In the autumn of that year, the school moved into the new campus. With more spacious buildings, the number of applicants increased day by day.</p>
<p>Enriching Content After moving into the new campus, because the construction aspect could be temporarily put on hold, efforts were made to enrich the content. In addition to equipment such as books and instruments, professors were hired, academic programs were added, and students were required to choose a major and minor department. Also, because the school site was moved to Taowu Valley, close to the University of Nanking, the two universities allowed students to cross-register for advanced courses in order to gain more knowledge.</p>
<p>Merger of the Women's Physical Education Teachers' School The Women's Physical Education Teachers' School, run by the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of Shanghai, enrolled high school graduates for two years of physical education training. In order to improve the students' level, the school was merged into the Physical Education Department of this school in 1925.</p>
<p>Establishment of an Affiliated Middle School In the autumn of 1924, because most of the graduates of the Education Department of this school served as teachers in various middle schools, in order to provide them with teaching experience and increase their service efficiency, a class of affiliated experimental middle school was established. This was the beginning of the current senior affiliated middle school.</p>
<p>Rockefeller Foundation Grant The Rockefeller Foundation Medical Committee found that the content of natural sciences in this school had reached a considerable level, so it gave an annual grant to encourage it.</p>
<p>Third Period – The Restructuring Period – 1927 to Present</p>
<p>Re-election of the President In 1927, after the National Government moved to Nanjing, the University Council stipulated that the president of a university must be a Chinese citizen. Therefore, Mrs. Lawrence Thurston, the president of this school, resigned from the board of directors and requested that a Chinese citizen be re-elected to succeed her, in order to show obedience to government laws. The board of directors appreciated her aspirations and re-elected Dr. Wu Yifang as president. Dr. Wu was a graduate of the first class of this school, had served as the director of the English Department of the National Beijing Women's Higher Normal School for three years, and had studied in the United States for six years. She took office in the autumn of 1928.</p>
<p>Change of School Name After the promulgation of the University Organization Law, this school prepared for registration in accordance with this law and changed its name to Private Ginling Women's Arts and Science College in accordance with the organization law. It applied to the Ministry of Education for registration and was formally approved in the winter of 1930.</p>
<p>Change of the Physical Education Simple Course to a Specialized Course This school recognized the shortage of physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools, so in the autumn of 1929, it established a class of physical education simple course, enrolling high school graduates and providing them with one year of physical education training. They graduated in the summer of 1930 and were almost all hired by various primary and secondary schools. However, many graduates were willing to receive another year of training, so starting in the autumn of 1930, the physical education specialized course was changed to a two-year program. There have already been three classes of graduates, and because there is a great need in society, it continues to be offered to this day.</p>
<p>Change of the Affiliated Experimental Middle School to a Senior Middle School The Affiliated Experimental Middle School had been established since 1924, and there was only one class, which was not expanded. In 1932, seeing the need for additional girls' high schools in the capital, the existing experimental middle school was changed into a purely girls' senior middle school. It was registered with the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in May 1933, and the Ministry of Education also approved the record. The school name was changed to the Affiliated Senior Middle School of this school.</p>
<p>New Buildings of This School The new buildings of this school can be divided into the affiliated middle school and the university. (A) For the affiliated middle school, a three-story dormitory building was built. This was donated by Mrs. Sun Yat-sen, Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to commemorate their mothers, expressing filial piety and benefiting students, which is truly admirable. (B) For the university, because when the school buildings were built before, there was still some remaining funds, which were not enough to build two large buildings at that time, so they were temporarily deposited in the bank to generate interest. In 1932, it was decided to withdraw the principal and interest for construction to complete the planned project. The completion ceremony was held at this time last year. The building on the north side is used as a library and office, and the building on the south side is used as a auditorium and music room.</p>
<p>The above points are only a general description of the progress of this school over the past twenty years. Due to space limitations, it is not possible to present them in detail. However, there is one more point that can be mentioned: starting from the previous year, the Ministry of Education has been providing subsidies to excellent private colleges and universities. This school receives a subsidy of more than 10,000 yuan per year. Although the amount is not large, it is worth noting that the authorities are able to provide incentives to excellent private schools.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Current Situation and Characteristics of This School <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Sources of Students The number of women's higher education institutions in our country is very small. In the north, there is only the Women's College of Arts and Sciences of National Peking University, and in the south, there is only the Hwa Nan Women's College of Fujou. As for the central region, there is only this school. Therefore, judging from the provinces of the current students enrolled in this school, there are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Nanyang, covering almost the entire country. In terms of the middle schools from which they graduated, there are as many as eighty schools, which is quite extensive.</p>
<p>Value of Equipment The equipment of this school, including school buildings, books, instruments, utensils, and land, has cost more than 1.5 million yuan. Compared with the time of establishment, it is almost 500 times greater.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs This school currently has two departments: arts and sciences. The departments established in each department are listed separately below.</p>
<p>Arts Department Major Departments: Chinese Literature, English Literature, History, Philosophy, Sociology, Music, Physical Education. The Physical Education Department has an affiliated Physical Education Specialized Course. Minor Departments: Psychology, Education. The Education Department has an affiliated Senior High School.</p>
<p>Science Department Major Departments: Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, Geography</p>
<p>Minor Departments: Hygiene</p>
<p>Richness of Academic Programs According to a recent survey by the Christian Education Association, among the thirteen Christian universities in the country, the number of students at this school is often ranked tenth or eleventh, but the total number of teaching hours per semester is ranked fifth or sixth. This shows the richness of the academic programs offered by this school.</p>
<p>Accuracy of Course Offerings The courses offered by this school are based on the needs of the students. For example, if the majority of graduates will be middle school teachers, then education is offered as a minor to clarify the principles of education and teaching methods. An affiliated middle school is also established to provide practical teaching and gain more experience. Each science department also offers special education methods to learn how to collect specimens, purchase instruments, and adopt textbooks. Also, in recent years, social construction has been emphasized. Because women are quiet and suitable for social work, the Sociology Department, in addition to guiding majors in conducting various field investigations, also has a Social Service Center to help students understand the living conditions of nearby farmers and workers and study and solve their difficult problems. If a course is requested by five or more students, efforts are made to open a class for them.</p>
<p>Attention to Lower-Level Students The basic courses such as Chinese and English for first- and second-year students are divided into small groups for teaching, so that it is easier to provide separate guidance, consolidate their foundation, and easily improve their grades. According to previous graduates who entered graduate schools, they are often able to obtain considerable honors. The only female student who was admitted to study in the UK with the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship two years ago was also a graduate of this school. This is related to the practical training of basic courses given to them at the beginning of their enrollment.</p>
<p>Research Atmosphere The atmosphere of academic research among the teachers and students of this school is strong. Various academic societies are able to be realistic and seek truth from facts. For example, during the recent Italian-Ethiopian War, the Geographical Society proposed a study of the geography of Italy and Ethiopia, so that students interested in geography could study, report, and discuss. Professors also publish books according to the needs of the academic community, such as gymnastics and dance by the Physical Education Department, middle school mathematics by Ms. Lu, and zoology by Dr. Li.</p>
<p>Training Beyond Knowledge This school upholds the principle that education is life and emphasizes the balanced development of students in all aspects, in order to cultivate their whole personality and talents. A few points are briefly described below.</p>
<p>1. Physical Fitness Training Physical and fitness examinations are conducted every autumn when school starts. The physical examination is conducted by the school doctor. Those who are not healthy are given special guidance or treatment. The fitness examination is conducted by the Physical Education Department. The results of the examination are classified into intense, moderate, and restricted physical education classes to provide appropriate training, improve their health. They are also taught a course on hygiene, and then tested again in the spring to see if there has been any progress.</p>
<p>2. Leadership Training Various organizations and regulations are in place for academic and extracurricular activities, so as to train students to gain experience in handling affairs, have methods to deal with or solve problems, develop a spirit of cooperation and responsibility, and serve society after graduation. In addition to the students themselves feeling the benefits of this training, those who work with them also praise it.</p>
<p>3. Cultivation of Service Habits What students learn is preparation for the future. However, if they only care about increasing their personal knowledge and do not contact the outside world, they often do not understand the needs of society or develop the drawbacks of selfishness. Therefore, students of this school, in their spare time, pay attention to cultivating the habit of practical service. A few examples are briefly cited to clarify this.</p>
<p>First, the Student YWCA founded the Peiyou Primary School, which was established from the second year of the school's opening and has not been interrupted. It has also been able to improve according to the needs of the environment. Recently, because a municipal primary school has been established not far from the school, it has been changed to the Yifan Women's Home Economics School this autumn, teaching older female students domestic knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, in 1931, during the great flood in the Yangtze River, the government conducted a survey of the entire disaster area to distribute relief funds according to the severity of the disaster. When the survey forms from various counties were all sent in, the survey committee lacked people to organize and count them. When the students of this school learned of this, they automatically donated their time to assist in the organization work every night for more than a month before it was completed.</p>
<p>Homelike Life with Group Organization Each dormitory of this school has a recreation room and a dining room, so that the roommates have a place to gather, like family members chatting. As for the bedrooms, the students sweep themselves and train in simple and clean living. Teachers get along with students like sisters in their spare time. Students like to ask teachers to be advisors for any organization they have, and teachers gladly participate, so the relationship between teachers and students is like a family, and there is even a sister class organization among students. This phenomenon is possible because most of the teachers and students of this school live on campus.</p>
<p>The above points are only a rough description of the current situation of this school or a brief review of the past. The teachers and staff of this school work hard and do not care about the salary. Graduates also go to poor and remote areas, such as the newly recovered bandit areas of Lichuan, Jiangxi, and bury themselves in work. This spirit of sacrifice is truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Current Status Survey of Graduates <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In 1919, this school held its first graduation, with only five graduates. Since then, there has been a graduation every year. This summer, it has reached the seventeenth graduation. They serve society with dedication and responsibility and have gained the trust of people in society. Therefore, during this period of serious employment problems, students of this school are still in high demand. According to the statistics of the Career Services Office, in the past three years, the number of people who have been hired by this school has exceeded the number of graduates by about three times, which shows the trust of people in society in the graduates of this school, which is very gratifying. As for those who seek further education, the number exceeds a quarter of all graduates. In terms of this number, there are not many to see in the country. For the sake of clarity, it is listed below.</p>
<p>A. Number of people who have obtained a Ph.D. in Philosophy or Science: 7</p>

<p>One by one, large, fat crabs are displayed in baskets in front of stores. The four characters "Fresh Lake Crab" arouse the appetite of the rich! They sting the hearts of the poor!</p>
<p>"When the crabs are fat, you must remember, the navel is round in September, the tip in October!" In front of the stores selling crabs, there is quarreling over the roundness and tip of the navel! There is fighting over the size! … Mr. Chen's dozens of baskets of lake crabs are all sold out in the midst of a clamor.</p>
<p>Thus, one day, two days, …, it is like this every day, watching the crab buyers hand silver coins one by one to the clerk, without the slightest stinginess!</p>
<p>Hey! Crab eaters! Now I will tell you an important matter, that is, the 20,000,000 disaster victims in various disaster areas are exposed to the wind and dew, and urgently await our relief!</p>

<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The autumn wind rises, and the sideways walking gentlemen gradually become chesty and fat. It's precisely the right time for scholars to compose poems about chrysanthemums while enjoying a good drink. It's not necessarily limited to scholars and elegant gentlemen; even common laborers and vulgar fellows, city monks and uncouth men, all have the means to buy five premium crabs. Returning home, they face their yellow-faced wives and munch on them for a while.</p>
<p>Indeed, the taste of crabs is delicious, something everyone acknowledges. But I wonder how many crab eaters know about the suffering in the lives of crab catchers. The author grew up in a water town and has seen the lives of crab catchers since childhood. Crab catching relies entirely on crab traps made of woven bamboo. Tall and short bamboo fences are planted haphazardly in the river, intermittently connecting the east bank to the west bank, forming a formation. Each crab weir, when set up, generally costs at least one hundred yuan or more at current prices, and annual repairs cost at least twenty yuan. Each crab weir lasts for at most ten years. As for the harvest, during the nine or ten months of the fishing season, a good one might yield close to two hundred yuan, while a poor year might only bring in about one hundred yuan. In the crab market, the income seems quite considerable, but what else can be obtained after the crab season? All that's left are mud shrimp and small crucian carp, things that don't fetch much money. Therefore, the lives of "crab people" are just like those of ordinary farmers, struggling in poverty and destitution year after year.</p>
<p>Crab catching is always done at night. Dim yellow lights hanging on the crab weirs tell you that the "crab people" are active. In that dim yellow light, armor-clad generals, attracted to the light, climb the weirs and become prey for the crab catchers. This scene might be considered poetic and artistic by young gentlemen in ivory towers, but the crab people are all complaining and blaming fate, regretting making a living this way, certain that they will starve to death one day. Because in Shanghai, a large crab costs one yuan, while at the crab catcher's place, one yuan can buy at least three catties or more.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Crab Catching Methods <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Time flies so fast; in the blink of an eye, it's already late autumn again. In the alleys and streets, you can hear the calls of "Want to buy crabs?" everywhere. This reminds us of the fun we had catching crabs in our childhood.</p>
<p>Catching crabs: How do you catch them? According to the methods in my eastern hometown, there are about three kinds, such as "weir crabs," "weir crabs," and "net crabs." Among these three methods, "weir crabs" are considered the most convenient and easiest to catch.</p>
<p>The weir crab method only requires using a net barrier to cut across the river port to catch crabs. The net barrier is made of thick hemp thread, woven into a flat net about three feet wide and twenty feet long. On the lower edge of the net, more than ten three-inch long, three- or four-tenths of an inch thick iron bars are fastened. Then, using a bamboo pole about twelve or thirteen feet long, the net barrier is lifted to the riverbank opposite the river port. When the bamboo pole is pulled back, the net barrier will sink to the bottom of the river. The upper end of the net barrier near the body is propped up with a bamboo chopstick, which is inserted into the mud on the riverbank. An oil lamp must also be placed next to the net's end because crab fishing must be done between 8 PM and 12 AM. When the crabs see the light, they will throw themselves into the net. If the upper end of the net barrier moves slightly, the net barrier is pulled up, and one by one, the large crabs, trapped in the mesh, like a string of beads, can be obtained effortlessly, five or six or seven or eight at a time. The amount of crabs caught depends on the coldness of the weather. The colder the weather, the more crabs are caught. Sometimes, dozens can be caught continuously every hour, which is very interesting! However, the river port for weir crabs must be a clear water river. There are very few in tidal rivers, and because they are washed by the tide, net barriers cannot be used. Crab nets can only be used to rake for crabs, or bamboo weirs can be used to weir crabs. Therefore, catching crabs in tidal rivers is not easy.</p>
<p>Weir crabs are probably monopolistic. One-inch thick, ten-foot-long pieces of mao bamboo are woven into a bamboo fence-like long curtain, which is cut across the heart of the river. The lower end of the bamboo pieces is inserted into the bottom of the river, and the two ends are tied to wooden stakes on both banks with thick hemp ropes. Another bamboo weir, three or four feet square and ten or more feet high, is made and firmly leaned against the bamboo curtain. It must be built sturdily so that the crabs swimming back and forth in the river can climb to the top of the bamboo curtain and fall into the bamboo weir, where a net can be used to scoop them up. Using this method to catch crabs can sometimes yield more than weir crabs because it uses monopolistic means to catch them, truly "wiping them out in one fell swoop."</p>
<p>Net crabs also have two kinds. One is "carrying" (two people dragging) net crab catching, using a large net with the tips of the four corners fastened with hemp ropes. One end of the net corner is tied to wooden stakes on both banks of the river, and the ropes at the other two ends are thrown onto the bridge railing. Three people must keep watch, pulling the net about every five minutes. If there are fish and crabs in the net, another person uses a net to scoop them up. If there is no bridge on the river, then two people have to stand on both banks to drag the net, which seems very strenuous.</p>
<p>Another kind is raking for crabs, using a square net made of bamboo heads, which is lowered into the river to rake. This method is convenient and can be used to catch crabs anywhere, but it is not suitable for catching crabs in deep river ports. Larger lakes can use this method to catch crabs.</p>

<p>— Yan BOGuang</p>
<p>Yellow chrysanthemums are blooming, and maple leaves are dyed with rouge. It is the time for holding crabs, drinking wine, appreciating chrysanthemums, and composing poetry. However, although crabs are delicious, they contain "grinding his life" essence, which can destroy a person's health. Moreover, they are too cold and can easily cause illness if eaten improperly.</p>
<p>There are river crabs and lake crabs. Lake crabs have tender and fresh meat, while river crabs have lean and bland meat. Every place that sells crabs in the market hangs a sign saying "Fresh Large Lake Crabs." Some even hang signs saying "Yangcheng Lake Crabs" to attract customers. But how many of them are real Yangcheng Lake crabs? If gourmets want to recognize the genuine Yangcheng Lake crabs, it is very easy. The crab's back is blue, the claws are golden, the hairs are yellow, and when placed on a gilded table, the crab's abdomen can walk sideways away from the table. This is powerful proof. When I worked in Wumen for three years, an old gourmet told me this, saying: "In Suzhou, you can't eat real Yangcheng Lake crabs; they are all imitations from Pingwang Yingduli Lake." So where did the Yangcheng Lake crabs go? They went to Shanghai to sell for a good price.</p>
<p>Poisonous crabs are: those with only one claw, one eye, two eyes facing each other, six or four feet, hair under the abdomen, bones in the abdomen, stars on the back, and red eyes. Eating the above can easily cause poisoning. Winter melon juice, perilla juice, garlic juice, fermented soybean juice, and reed root juice can all detoxify crab poison.</p>
<p>Crabs can cause wind. People with wind diseases should not eat them. Crabs and persimmons are incompatible and should never be eaten together. Eating them together can cause cholera.</p>
<p>Since crabs have so many harms, we cannot help but eat them because they are delicious. We can only be extra careful when choosing them. When we bring them home, we wash them clean with a clean water brush, embed a slice of fresh ginger and several grains of salt in the navel, and put a handful of perilla leaves and water into the pot (available at Chinese medicine stores). After the crabs are tied up, they are placed on top of the perilla leaves and boiled. Simmer briefly, and eat with more ginger. Never eat it with Shi Guogong's medicine!</p>
<p>There is a saying that crabs have nine pointed parts and ten round parts, but in late September and early October of the lunar calendar, each has its own charm, with fat intestines and full roe, which can be enjoyed greatly. People with cold stomachs should eat a bowl of longan soup after eating crabs to avoid stomach pain and abdominal pain.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Crab Recipes <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— (Hong Yang)</p>
<p>Dry-Steamed Crab Meat and Roe: The method is to use freshwater crabs weighing four or five taels each, wash them clean, and place them in a steamer to heat. Remove the crab meat and crab roe and crab oil. When peeling, be sure not to mix the roe and oil into the crab meat, and place them separately. After peeling, take a large basin, place the crab meat on the bottom of the basin, and spread the crab legs and claws on top, topping it off with crab oil. Slightly pour in aged wine, cover with a sea bowl, and steam over high heat. Remove immediately, pour two spoons of minced scallions and boiling lard on top of the crab meat, and the dry-steamed crab meat and roe is complete. When eating, be sure to mix in the prepared ginger mince and sugar vinegar while it is hot, so that the taste is fresh and has a true flavor.</p>
<p>Crab Omelet: Crab omelet is a strong flavor in crab dishes. The method is to wash the large crab shell, leaving the two teeth of the shell connecting the crab bag in the center of the shell edge. Put the peeled crab meat, crab roe, and minced fatty meat into the shell, level with the shell, and spread meat crumbs on top of the meat crumbs. Coat the surface with egg mixed with flour, sear until golden brown in boiling oil, add aged wine, soy sauce, white sugar and water over the top, and cook over high heat until the soup becomes thick, the flavor is extremely strong and beautiful. The most important thing is to mix some aged wine, soy sauce, and white sugar into the batter, and it is also good to add a little minced green onion and ginger, but do not add vinegar and salt, and the seasoning must be accurate, not too salty or too sweet.</p>
<p>Crab Soup: Crab soup is a type of soup. The method is to briefly fry crab meat in lard, add wine, soy sauce, minced green onion and ginger, and water. Cook it into a soup, and after it boils for five or six minutes, add yellow flour to make a thick soup. When it boils, take it up, and the crab soup is complete. If you like sour, you can add a little rice vinegar, but it is best not to add it.</p>
<p>Gold Inlaid Jade: Gold Inlaid Jade is made with crab roe and crab oil. The method is to put crab roe and crab oil in a lard pot and fry it. Immediately add wine, soy sauce, and white sugar, and remove it immediately after it boils. Crab oil is easy to dissolve, so the lard must be extremely boiling. After putting it in the pot, it must be quickly removed, otherwise the crab oil will dissolve into the lard.</p>
<p>Sichuan Large Feet: Sichuan Large Feet is made with the meat of crab legs and claws. First, boil them in chicken soup, pour in the crab meat, and add wine to remove the fishy taste after boiling. Then add salt and remove from the pot and eat. It is clear, rich, fresh, and without any oil, making it a delicacy in clear soup.</p>
<p>Fried Crab Meat Noodles: Mix the peeled crab meat with a little aged wine and salt, and then mix in minced fresh meat. Wrap it in tofu skin into a long shape, coat it with egg mixed with flour, and fry it in lard. When the egg noodles turn yellow, you can dip it in vinegar and eat it. It is crispy and delicious.</p>
<p>Crab Meat Cabbage Heart: Take the heart of green vegetables, cut it into strips about an inch long, and put it in a lard pot to stir-fry. When the cabbage heart is about to soften, add crab meat and a little chicken soup and cook until the vegetables are soft. Add wine and salt and cook until the soup is thick. Take it out to eat. The taste of the cabbage heart is better than that of the crab meat, but when cooking this, do not cover the pot, because the vegetables will turn yellow after covering, and the clear aroma of the vegetables will be completely lost. If you do not cover it, the color will be green and the true flavor of the vegetables can be preserved. If there is no chicken soup, you can add water and mix in monosodium glutamate, which is also very delicious.</p>
<p>There are other crab recipes, but due to space limitations, I cannot say more, but to cook crabs, you must use good aged wine to remove the fishy taste of the crabs. This is the most important thing.</p>

<p>— (Ying Dai)</p>
<p>Crab is indeed a very delicious thing among aquatic foods. Once autumn arrives, in addition to the streets being filled with crab stalls, the people selling along the streets carry loads, open their throats, and shout "Crabs! Crabs!..." And then people will once again experience the craze for eating crabs. There are also thresholds for eating crabs. If you eat them without knowing the proper way, you will lose the delicious taste.</p>
<p>First, we must also look at the season when eating crabs. In early autumn, crabs are just coming onto the market, and nineteen out of ten are so thin that they have no meat. When cooked, they are just a bag of water, not only not fresh but also have a bitter taste. Strictly speaking, crabs only become fat and strong when the west wind rises. Around the beginning of last month of the lunar calendar is the best time to eat crabs. In September of the lunar calendar, female crabs are probably better than male crabs, and in October, male crabs are better. Therefore, there is a saying "Nine female and ten male," which we can take as a guide to eating crabs.</p>
<p>The most refreshing way to eat crabs is of course to use what Shanghai people call "a large boiled crab," which is to cook the crab with clean water and eat it with soy sauce. However, even "a large boiled crab" has its own thresholds. Eating the crabs as soon as they come out of the water is of course the freshest. Because we buy so many that we can't finish them all at once, we inevitably raise them for a day or two, but we can't keep them for too long, because they will become thin if kept for too long. When cooking, use cold water. If you use warm water, the crab legs will fall off. The process should not be too long or too short. If it is too long, the crab meat will become old; if it is too short, it will not be cooked through. When you open the pot and see cracks in the crab's back, you're done. Eat "large boiled crabs" while they are hot. It is best to eat them as soon as they are taken out of the pot. Use high-quality natural soy sauce. Some people think that crabs are very cold, so they put ginger, pepper, and other things in the soy sauce. Some people take a few sips of wine after eating crabs, and some people put perilla, ginger, and other things in the pot when cooking them to remove the cold air.</p>
<p>There are many ways to eat crabs. In addition to "large boiled crabs," you can also peel the meat from "large boiled crabs" and use lard, soy sauce, and other seasonings to stir-fry crab meat. If you put more in crab meat soup, it becomes crab soup. In addition, crab stewed eggs, crab scrambled eggs, crab meat shreds, crab meat balls, crab fried tofu, crab fried bean curd sheets, etc., are too many to list. They are all made with peeled crab meat. However, we must not forget one thing, which is that when cooking things with crab meat, you should probably put some of the soup from the beginning of cooking the crab in it after filtering it, which will make it extra delicious.</p>
<p>In addition, people who are particular about eating peel a lot of crab meat between September and October and put it in a pot to cook with lard, called crab pork fat. After freezing, it can be stored for a long time without spoiling. When the weather is cold in the middle of winter and there are no crabs on the market, put some crab pork fat in the soup or dishes. It is not only very delicious but also has a crab flavor. I believe people who eat crabs may want to cook some crab pork fat and store it.</p>

<p>— Tian Xu WOSheng</p>
<p>Crab should not be eaten with persimmons or jingjie (Nepeta tenuifolia), which all old people know, but in new foods, there are often reactions that cause poisoning. The wife of Xiao Die, Xian Jun, used to eat crab with brandy without noticing anything at first. After a few hours, she had excruciating abdominal pain and vomited to relieve it. The wife of the second Die once ate crab with wine and had the same symptoms. I didn't believe it at first, so I tried it myself. It was very strange. In the middle of the night, I suddenly woke up with excruciating intestinal pain. Vomiting medicine was ineffective. My intestines were rumbling, and my abdominal wall bulged out like a fist. I then took diluted hydrochloric acid and rhubarb wine. To get to the bottom of it, I first read in the herbal classics that Tao Hongjing said: "Crabs before the frost are poisonous, which is caused by eating water solanum (i.e., belladonna in Western medicine). If people are poisoned by it, most will die without treatment. Those with only one claw, one eye, two eyes facing each other, six or four feet, hair under the abdomen, bones in the abdomen, stars on the head and back, and spotted feet and red eyes should not be eaten, as they are poisonous and harmful to people." Li Shizhen said: "All crabs are cold and not very poisonous. Mix them with ginger and vinegar, pair them with aged wine, chew on the roe and hold the claws, and taste the flavor slightly. What poison is there? Gluttons eat a lot at once, and they mix in meat and greasy food, eating twice as much as usual. The stomach and intestines are injured, causing abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, which is bound to happen, and they blame the crabs. What fault do the crabs have?" I think Tao and Li's sayings are enough to increase common sense. Holding crabs after the frost is something we always do, pairing them with wine, yellow or white, each with its own merits. Yellow wine removes the fishy taste, while white wine wards off the cold. Even if we are drunk and full, we are still fine. This is enough to see that the problem really lies in the wine. Most of the wines sold on the market are made with sugar syrup and spirits, while brandy is made with alcohol and ester. There is no need for a reaction. Only those that I make myself are brewed from real fresh grapes, so there is a reaction. Crab roe is very rich in ammonium phosphate, while the meat is rich in potassium phosphate and calcium. Therefore, dead crabs emit an ammonia smell and can turn paint into water. Any lacquerware can be washed with caustic potash or ammonia water to remove the paint. This is clear proof. Because it is a strong alkaline action, it can dissolve glue, paint, and potassium phosphate. When it meets tartaric acid, it can decompose into potassium tartrate and sodium and turn into monomeric phosphorus. The reason why red-headed matches can kill people is the phosphorus poison. Ammonia is ammonia, which is originally a gas, so it causes intestinal rumbling. What Song Yu called "circling the intestines and stirring up the qi" is this state, and the excruciating abdominal pain is caused by caustic potash eroding the stomach wall. If you try it with caustic potash, it will immediately cause burning pain and corrosion when it touches the skin. Potassium, sodium, and ammonia are all neutralized by hydrochloric acid and turned into cough-suppressing and qi-lowering medicine. Taking advantage of rhubarb's one-time purgative effect is like opening the floodgates to release silt, all of which is discharged. The unique feature of rhubarb is that it stops with one purge and does not linger. (Unfinished)</p>

<p>Opium contains a toxic substance that can stimulate the internal organs of the human body, causing an abnormal secretion and paralyzing the nerves, indirectly exciting them for a while. Therefore, after smoking, people feel refreshed and happy. However, smoking for a long time will weaken the nerves and deplete the secretions. Therefore, it is impossible not to smoke. Not smoking will cause yawning and runny noses, presenting various symptoms of addiction, leading to chronic poisoning. Those who quit smoking temporarily change their habits and replace them with other products, and their bodies will experience various discomforts and changes, causing headaches, back pain, insomnia, nocturnal emission, and other diseases. Therefore, many people stop quitting smoking and resume smoking. Stanner's endocrine preparation "Germinal Substance" is the only sacred agent for supplementing internal organ secretions. Therefore, taking it can regulate the secretion, refresh the mind, and make the body comfortable. Taking it during quitting smoking can prevent all diseases and pains from arising and achieve the full success of quitting smoking. Therefore, it is favored by doctors and is the savior that those who quit smoking have been longing for.</p>

<p>The patient Mao Zhongling has always been weak and has never had a healthy day. He is now thirty-nine years old. During the January 28 Incident, he was in the war zone and did not have time to escape, so he suffered great fear and lacked food. By the time the war stopped, his nerves were greatly affected and he fell into extreme weakness. He suffered from palpitation, cold limbs, body tremors, anemia, insomnia, nocturnal emission, and other symptoms. He delayed treatment and his bones were about to fall apart. Later, he was accompanied by his younger brother-in-law to my clinic for treatment. In addition to instructing him on how to maintain his health, I gave him a large amount of germinal substance, three times a day, two tablets each time, and two Himitos' solid essence tablets before going to bed. After seven weeks, he was full of energy, his blood and qi were abundant, and his limbs were strong. All symptoms such as nocturnal emission, insomnia, and palpitation had long since disappeared. Compared to before, he was like a different person.</p>

<p>Health and beauty are related and connected. Without health, there is no beauty. With beauty, there is health. However, today's women either suffer from irregular menstruation or from prolonged leukorrhea, regarding it as a hidden disease and accustomed to it. They conceal and delay treatment. Health is no longer healthy, so what beauty is there? And the husband is indifferent, listening to his wife being tortured by the disease, and instead blaming her for not being able to conceive after many years of marriage. Is this not regrettable?</p>
<p>Mrs. Sha Haifan is a beautiful and healthy young woman. She and Mr. Sha are a match made in heaven, and everyone admires them. Three years after marriage, Mrs. Sha contracted dysentery. After recovery, she gradually became thin and weak, her menstruation was irregular, and she also suffered from leukorrhea. Her health was lost, and her demeanor was reduced. The feelings between husband and wife gradually wavered. Later, Mrs. Xia Qianli introduced her to my clinic for treatment. I told her to purchase "female" germinal substance directly from the Anlise Western Pharmacy for internal use and "Cure Leukorrhea" for external use to treat leukorrhea. After about two months, menstruation was regulated, leukorrhea stopped, the body became strong, and her former beauty was restored. The couple's relationship was also maintained.</p>

<p>The bad habit of masturbation is an open secret among young people, which is almost unavoidable for everyone. As a result, many people suffer from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Health disappears, and there are many diseases. A body with potential becomes a weak body, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang is from Xiamen, twenty-five years old. He started masturbating ten years ago, wasting away his essence without caring for himself. He began to quit at the age of nineteen because he was about to get married. However, he suffered from insomnia and nocturnal emission every night. He married in the spring of his twentieth year and suffered from premature ejaculation. He delayed treatment, which led to neurasthenia, night sweats, back pain, and mental depression. Later, Mr. Peng Zhongzhi introduced him to my clinic for treatment. I found that his youthful glands were in a state of extreme weakness and prescribed germinal substance and Himitos' solid essence tablets. After about two months, the old diseases were all removed, and the chronic diseases were cured. I recently received a letter from him thanking me, saying that his wife is now pregnant after many years of marriage and praising the effectiveness of the two drugs.</p>

<p>Addiction to smoking is like being chained by a giant chain. It is impossible to quit, and it is difficult to get rid of. It is like being trapped in a dark hell or sinking into a sea of ​​suffering. The spirit is listless, and the appearance is emaciated, which is very painful.</p>
<p>Recently, the government is determined to eliminate drugs. The orders are magnificent, and they are carried out vigorously. Smoking cessation drugs on the market are like bamboo shoots after rain. They are not bad, but those who quit take them because of their weak bodies and many diseases, so they give up halfway and cannot complete their success. This is also a major problem during the smoking cessation period.</p>
<p>My residence is next to a hospital, so I am the first to get the moon near the water tower. I have carefully observed which product is the most pleasant and painless to take during the smoking cessation period, so that I can learn from it to quit my old addiction for many years. As a result, I learned that Stanner's Germinal Substance is the most effective. I purchased four boxes from the China-England Pharmacy and took them according to law during the quitting period. Sure enough, I did not develop any diseases and felt refreshed. Germinal substance is indeed a strong backing for those who quit smoking.</p>

<p>— Contribution from Pu Yannong</p>
<p>When I was seventeen, I was led astray by bad friends and committed masturbation. Because I relied on my strong body, I did it every day, which was very harmful. After a long time, I gradually felt headaches, mental fatigue, tinnitus, and dizziness. I knew it was harmful and stopped. However, I suffered from insomnia and seminal emission every night, and my body became increasingly weak. After marriage, I also suffered from premature ejaculation. I took various medications without effect. Later, I went to Dr. Ren Guoxiang for treatment. He introduced me to use "Shengzhi Su" (Reproductive Element) and Ximituo's "Gujing Pian" (Sperm-Solidifying Pills). I took them according to the instructions for just over a month, and all the symptoms disappeared, and I recovered my health.</p>

<p>(1) The Most Important Question Before Marriage</p>
<p>Patient Hua Zicai, 21 years old, from Guizhou, born in Shanghai, a student. In his childhood, he was led astray by bad friends and committed masturbation, which caused kidney damage, listlessness, and weakness. He often felt sore back and pain. Mr. Hua was very talented and had a beautiful demeanor, which was very popular with the opposite sex. He had relationships with two or three people, but he suffered from premature ejaculation, which was a major shortcoming. He often suffered from secret ridicule, nerve irritation, and indescribable pain. He bought and took a certain tonic pill, which was actually a stimulant, and suffered a lot from it. He then suffered from symptoms such as thin sperm and weak brain. Since then, his studies have deteriorated, his face has lost color, and his demeanor has sharply declined. Former lovers have given him the cold shoulder one by one. He has lost love to four rivals. This spring, because he is about to get married, he knows that if he does not quickly cure his illness, it will not be a blessing for his future conjugal life. So he came to me for treatment. I diagnosed his youthful gland as weak, so I used radio waves to transmit to his peripheral nerves and prescribed a large number of endocrine preparations, Standard's "Shengzhi Su" (Reproductive Element). After taking more than four boxes, he achieved complete success. Recently, he sent a letter to thank me, saying that his wife is already five months pregnant, and he deeply appreciates the effect of "Shengzhi Su" (Reproductive Element).</p>
<p>(2) Another Young Patient</p>
<p>Patient Cen Mengshi, 19 years old, committed masturbation five years ago, which caused his body to be weak and unable to develop. Later, he knew it was harmful and painfully stopped. However, he suffered from insomnia every night. After falling asleep, he had many erotic dreams. In a trance, he already had seminal emission, about seven or eight times a month. His face was yellow and thin, and he was about to become consumptive. Later, he was introduced by Mr. Qiang to come to me for diagnosis and treatment. After I prescribed Ximituo's "Gujing Pian" (Sperm-Solidifying Pills), his seminal emission soon stopped. He also took Standard's "Shengzhi Su" (Reproductive Element), which nourishes sperm, blood, and benefits the brain. After taking about half a dozen, his complexion was ruddy, his muscles were strong, he slept soundly at night, and his body also achieved good development.</p>

<h3 id="e202">The Issue of Abolishing Corporal Punishment in Elementary Schools <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The newspaper reports that the Ministry of Education, based on the National Children's Year Implementation Conference, submitted a request to instruct the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to inform local elementary schools' research associations to study the promotion of abolishing corporal punishment in elementary schools and removing all restrictions on children. The original submission and research issues are specially copied and distributed to the education departments and bureaus for compliance.</p>
<p>Corporal punishment was very common in private schools in our country. Most private school teachers had a ruler prepared to beat the palms of students when they could not recite the scriptures, did not answer questions correctly, or committed mistakes. This was the lighter form of corporal punishment. There were also heavier punishments, such as making students kneel on money boards or snail shells. Private schools used corporal punishment with the intention of punishing students, so that they would know to fear punishment, be able to study diligently, and behave according to the rules. Whether this legislation was appropriate and could achieve educational effects is difficult to say. But its cruelty was extremely barbaric. All those who attended private schools as children have a bad impression of the teachers.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this kind of corporal punishment is still common in elementary schools today, which is really strange. Today, elementary school students are often beaten by teachers when they cannot answer questions or occasionally make naughty moves. As for more severe punishments, they can still be seen. It is said that this type of punishment is also used in some inland middle schools. Therefore, corporal punishment has become a scheme worthy of discussion in our country's education.</p>
<p>However, corporal punishment is not only practiced in our country's schools, but also in foreign schools. According to Lowes in his book "Are We Civilized?", in the chapter on education, he said: "Until recently, European elementary school teachers often used whips to beat seven-year-old children, causing them to suffer injuries for life. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, young dukes and even kings were brutally beaten by their teachers." Luo Mai's "Theory of Education," in the chapter on punishment, also said: "In the past until very recent times, the punishment of children and young girls was considered natural and generally thought to be necessary in education." But the result made a senior writer feel that his childhood past was not necessarily regrettable. Because after he stopped going to school, he did not have to be afraid of being punished every day, which was the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>Here, we believe that it is inappropriate to use corporal punishment in elementary schools, and it should be abolished. In some respects, corporal punishment may be beneficial to children, but in other respects, it is harmful to children. It will not have any effect on education. Therefore, we strongly agree with the Ministry of Education's instruction to local elementary schools' research associations to study the promotion of abolishing corporal punishment in elementary schools. This year is Children's Year, and we hope that the education authorities can implement the abolition of corporal punishment in elementary schools, relieve children of a layer of suffering, and give children a good impression.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Sleepless Night <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>I turned off the lights and lay in bed, but it was difficult to fall asleep. A kind of inexplicable worry invaded my heart. Like gloomy clouds on a rainy day, it weighed heavily on me, making it hard to breathe. My eyes were open, but what was there to see? The top of the mosquito net was blurry, and of course, the outside was also hazy... I was very clear, I knew it was another sleepless night. I straightened my body and stubbornly thought, I was prepared to bear all the troubles of a sleepless person!</p>
<p>So a depressed heart ran wild. Thinking of all kinds of illusory dreams, crimson, orange, gray, purple, black... So immersed in emptiness, I sighed softly, so weakly, like a broken spider silk in the wind. I opened the mosquito net and looked up at the courtyard. The courtyard was lonely. Even the little sparrows that usually broke the silence of the courtyard were no longer noisy at this time. Two old cypress trees stood upright, gloomy and stubborn at the same time. It seemed to be threatening something</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>what. Perhaps this whole courtyard of loneliness was brewed by it? In the silence, I seemed to hear the sound of dew drops touching the tips of the deep autumn grass, I seemed to hear the breathing of the leaves of the old ginkgo tree...</p>
<p>Old ginkgo, I only got to know it when I came here. I often used the attitude of an explorer to explore everything about it. It is particularly majestic, facing each other in the east and west in the courtyard. The one on the east is male, leaning its body and stretching out its old arms. The blue sky at night is particularly blue and particularly high. The male old ginkgo, I know it loves to have absurd dreams, it seems to want to embrace the blue and high sky with all its heart. The female one is more kind, and often ripe seeds fall down with a dull sound because no one picks them, so the fruits are always falling endlessly. The fall of its first fruit was more than half a month ago, but now there are still fruits falling, and perhaps they will not be finished falling in another half a month. Both old ginkgo trees are more than a hundred years old, and their memories are very old. Whenever dusk comes, a bloody red glow is reflected on the branches, and the old ginkgo speaks many old stories in a complicated way. It will say that the red walls of the Confucius Temple have long faded, and after fading, they were painted red again, and the red faded again. It will say that there are charming foxes wagging their tails in the courtyard in the deep night. It will also say that the little sparrows between the rafters do not know how many generations have passed. It knows all the absurd, old, and strange stories clearly, it is a correct history textbook.</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, opening my eyes, quietly listening to the dull sound, I know it is the fruit falling from that female ginkgo tree again. Then a night breeze gently blows, and the leaves flutter down rustling, one sheet, one sheet, I know it is sticking to the grass, or sticking to the soil. Again, a dull sound, a ginkgo fruit falls, again, a dull sound, a ginkgo fruit falls... This sound is particularly loud and clear, shattering the deep dream of the night...</p>
<p>Then the pale moon climbed up from the treetops. The sickly cold light fluttered in through the window, painting a milky white blur on the calligraphy hanging on the wall. Looking carefully, the sparse shadow of the old ginkgo tree is projected on the floor through the window, this is the masterpiece of the autumn night moon, right? The old cypress tree that does not often sway is still suppressing everything with a threatening posture. Four or five sickly chrysanthemums, because they cannot get sunlight, are hiding in a corner of the wall, cowering as if they cannot withstand the slightest sway of the night wind. The little grass is shrinking and waiting for the moistening of the cold-faced and warm-hearted dew drops. As for me, I groped along the edge of the bed, groped along the corner of the table, looked out the window, and looked back at my own thin shadow pressing on the masterpiece of the autumn night moon—the sparse shadow of the old ginkgo tree coming through the window. I almost suspected that I was a terrible ghost!</p>
<p>I don't want to turn on the light, and I don't want to find one or two articles to dispel my loneliness. I am prepared to bear all the troubles of a sleepless person. The night, although it is deep and long, I am prepared for the pale moon to cross the western sky and flutter the sickly cold light in from the west window. I have the stubborn heart of a prisoner about to be executed, I want to see the dawn of the eastern sky.</p>

<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>One early winter morning, the weather was unexpectedly cold; the gray-yellow sunlight only weakly shone on a flat hillside. Five or six low houses were clustered tightly around the slope, but most of them were already leaning slightly. A curved dirt road stretched out in front of the slope, winding eastward, and could be connected to the main road on Xiaoyao Palace, from which you could go to the town and the lime kiln. A stagnant pool stretched out on the side of the road, and there was also a stone well at the end of the pool; these were to supply the people on the slope with drinking water and washing things. Now half of the water in the pool has been used up, and because it is stagnant water, it has turned dark green. A thin layer of ice is frozen on the surface of the water, but in several places at the "crossing," it has been stirred open by people washing vegetables and rice in the morning. At that time, on the few pine trees floating in the pool, there were several small sparrows leisurely and lively jumping and chirping, some were repairing their wings, and some were turning over the millet in the piles of yellow vegetable leaves by the pool.</p>
<p>Under the old plum tree on the west side, there was a dilapidated Ten Earth Temple. It was sitting there quietly and alone, about ten steps away from those low stone houses. The front of the temple was piled with a row of high and low straw stacks; it was after the autumn harvest of the people on the slope, and they had not yet put the straw into the houses. A mangy thin dog was squatting there biting a dog tick in the sun—</p>
<p>The time was only a moment away from opening at noon; the people on the slope, men and women, had gone to the mountains to collect firewood. Every family's door was tightly closed. The surroundings were so quiet, except for the occasional magpie flying to the roof of someone's house or the old plum tree and calling a few times, the air on the entire hillside was so stuffy that it was like death, and almost no trace of life could be found.</p>
<p>Only the wooden public, who had been forgotten in the Land Temple, was coughing and struggling to get up from the straw bed piled with broken cotton wool in the musty corner of the wall, but somehow. A series of coughs and chokes came from his chest: he felt that his head was swollen badly today, his head was heavy, and his eyelids could not be lifted, the house, the ground, everything was turning in front of his eyes, and even his own person was turning with them. The waist was so painful that it was like someone was breaking it. He closed his eyes and fell back down, but a series of coughs and chokes climbed up from his throat again.</p>
<p>"The frost has fallen, right! The deadly old illness is about to flare up again, flare up... die... it's... also... good..." he muttered to himself, but the ending sound seemed to be with a heavy trembling.</p>
<p>He barely touched the door, and sat down with difficulty on a pile of straw, leaning his body on the straw, looking at the faint and powerless sun. He often spoke so convulsively and laboriously, "Um ya! Um ya!" His face was thin and with a heavy shade, the image of a skeletal skull, with a pair of dry and godless eyes. The clear snot frozen on that clump of gray-white beard was like a row of beads stuck on it, shining. The broken cotton-padded jacket he was wearing had chunks of rotten cotton wool squeezed out of the holes. Sitting in the sun, his body was still shivering! "</p>
<p>He often resented his fate, hoping that he would die sooner, so as to avoid such suffering, but he still did not die, but dragged on like this for another year; this illness came more fiercely in the winter; the wooden public sadly moved his pair of eyes looking at the sun not very vividly, but the bright clear tears stored in his eye sockets seemed to jump out from the tips of his eyelashes.</p>
<p>The sun was crooked to the south, still depressed like an opium ghost's face, only some shadows of the sparse forest had moved a position, but the wind was blowing so hard that the treetops were shaking a little.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the skinny dog lying on another pile of straw stretched lazily, stood up, and dragged its vertical tail to the side of the wooden public. He sniffed at his body very affectionately and lay down gently in front of him. It also seemed to understand the sadness in the wooden public's heart, and gave him a kind of sympathetic comfort...</p>

<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>Autumn</p>
<p>It's autumn, I have the heart of a begonia.</p>
<p>The heart of a begonia is lonely and bleak.</p>
<p>During the day, looking at the green or gray-white clouds, looking at the unchanging chimney, looking at the smoke slowly dissipating from the chimney, this is autumn.</p>
<p>At night, a ten-candlepower light bulb, listening to the rain outside the window, the sound of the rain is like a low complaint and like a cry, besides that, it is a piece of stillness, even the sound of autumn insects is gone, autumn is deep.</p>
<p>Many cigarettes are burned in vain, and many pots of boiled water are drunk in vain, but the heart is still like pale white clouds.</p>
<p>There is no anger, anger can strengthen the will to resist; there is no plan and hope, with a plan and hope, there is the courage to bandage the wounds and fight again; there is only a vast heart like white clouds, there is only a lonely and bleak heart like a begonia.</p>
<p>Summer has passed, winter has not yet come, spring? It's been too long to go, and the days to come are too far away, although I know that spring will inevitably come.</p>
<p>What can I do? Except look at the gray-white clouds, look at the chimney, look at the gradually dissipating smoke.</p>
<p>Or under the ten-candlepower light bulb, listening to a piece of stillness.</p>
<p>Friendship</p>
<p>A friend once said: "A friend is always a friend, and a father is only a relative."</p>
<p>When I read that letter, I saw my friend's anger, I saw my friend's face was red, and he drank a lot of wine.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was another letter the next day. He advised me to destroy the previous letter.</p>
<p>The reason is: Don't offend friends, this is what I said after drinking,</p>
<p>I destroyed that letter, but I copied that sentence in the manual.</p>
<p>Now, I don't need that manual, I can recite those two sentences:</p>
<p>"A friend is always a friend, and a father is only a relative."</p>
<p>——Friendship, if it is only built on private relationships, then there will always be a day of destruction.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Precious Stone Hill <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>In the morning, wisps of drizzle hung from the sky, the bleak color spreading vast and wide. Looking out from the window of the small house, the branches and leaves swayed gently. The market of Hangzhou was still so silent, yet such weather was such a disappointment to me! Coming all the way from afar, only to have it drizzle every day! However, because of my excitement, I quickly ran to the street, bought a paper umbrella, and prepared to climb the mountain to play in the rain. At this time, a kind of uneasy adventurous spirit was rising and stirring in my heart. Because I didn't know the mountain roads of Hangzhou, especially on such a desolate and quiet rainy day, which made things somewhat different from the ordinary.</p>
<p>As I ran along the lakeside towards the northwest, gusts of autumn wind brushed against me, penetrating into my chest, and I felt a different kind of coolness. Of course, there were not many tourists at this time, and the calm lake surface was being beaten by the light rain. After running for about twenty minutes, I turned onto the wide mountain road of Baoshi Hill from the back lakeside. From there, I could see the Baochu Pagoda standing on the top of the mountain like a delicate beauty. However, this slanted peak, when viewed from the foot of the mountain, was vaguely half-covered by a desolate thatched cottage and green leaves.</p>
<p>How quiet this road was! On both sides, the black shadows of the jungle swayed, and the rustling sound drifted into my ears. There was no song of birds, and the universe was just a desolate silence. Moreover, the mountain road was so high that a tense feeling arose in my heart, perhaps it could be said to be fear, and I opened my eyes wide to look carefully to the left, right, front, and back. I myself found this infinitely ridiculous. After climbing for a long time, I reached halfway up the mountain, where there was nothing but desolate thatch. It was with great difficulty that I found a small winding path that could be followed. When I entered a dilapidated temple, I only saw the ruined gray walls and the strange drawings and characters that were quietly depicted on them. Climbing up the stone steps one by one, and circling twice in the thatch, I finally reached the side of the Precious Stone Pagoda. At this time, the tense feeling in my heart that had been frightened all along relaxed.</p>
<p>The Precious Stone Pagoda is tall and pointed, different from the ancient pagodas in other places. It is like a graceful beauty, standing proudly on the top of the mountain, overlooking the scenery of Hangzhou, facing the lake like a flat mirror. At this time, the rain had stopped, so I sat by the pagoda, quietly enjoying the happiness of a loner, squinting my eyes, and recalling that the Precious Stone Pagoda, as seen from the lake at night, was hung all over with glittering electric lights, just like a beauty wearing gorgeous and dazzling clothes. Moreover, this pagoda is like a slender and long bamboo shoot. There is an ancient saying, "Leifeng is like an old monk, Baochu is like a beauty." Now, I can see it, especially at night, I can even prove that the saying is true.</p>
<p>In the distance, I gazed at the mountain peaks hidden in the thick mist, faintly. The water waves of the West Lake, shaped like shells, were no different from the bleak sky, spreading out and continuing vastly. The saying "the sky and water merge into one color" is also very true when used to describe the quiet West Lake in autumn. From here, I could also see the North Lonely Hill, which looked like a huge bird spreading its wings and lying in the West Lake. The North Lonely Hill is overgrown with lush green trees, and everything in the mountain cannot be seen clearly. One can only see that it is connected to the lakeside by the Bai Causeway, which is full of willows, and the red wooden Botanical Society Bridge. The Fanghe Pavilion and Xu Xiaoqing's Tomb are arranged side by side on the shore of the back lake, and are only a small shape, just like the broken lotuses on the lake swaying in my eyes piece by piece.</p>
<p>On the quiet Precious Stone Hill, I had enjoyed all the autumn scenery. So, in the desolate wilderness, in the high and dangerous small path of the stone gorge, I hummed a cheerful tune, passed through the Laifeng Pavilion, and went to explore the frightening thatch again.</p>

<p>(1) Humans are the most intelligent of all things, because humans have human knowledge, human will, and human emotions. We have established human culture and are constantly advancing it; we have expanded human power and thus dominate all living beings.</p>
<p>(2) Humans are the enemy of all things, because humans wield human power, use human weapons, and indulge in human cruelty. For the sake of human enjoyment, we have developed the habit of killing, which has gradually turned into human entertainment, satisfying cruel pleasure.</p>
<p>(3) Please look at the horses and cattle under the whip, with broken skin and rotten flesh; please look at the birds and beasts under the sharp knife, their bones roasted and their oil boiled. Three or five friends use millions of living beings to accompany their meals and drink their wine. Even beneficial insects and birds that are kind to humans are taken and demanded. We have damaged the kindness and generosity in human emotions, cultivated the ruthlessness of mankind, and ultimately led to endless mutual battles between people. It is pitiful that people kill each other until only hills of white bones remain!</p>
<p>(4) Please, everyone, put down your butcher knives immediately and establish benevolence and education; avoid such unbearable abuse, and do not make it difficult to endure. If you can spare them, then spare them. Let hundreds of millions of living beings avoid being destroyed and painfully wiped out. Allow the beneficial insects and birds that are kind to humans to grow and disappear on their own. Cleanse the ferocity and cruelty in human emotions, cultivate the compassion that is the most precious treasure of mankind, and hope that people will never need to use cannons against each other, but only ask that people teach each other to understand that doing good is the highest virtue!</p>
<p>(Epilogue) Compatriots: Do not delay, sincerely cleanse your hearts, know your mistakes and correct them, understand your minds and see your nature, and the truth will never fade. Protecting life is protecting the world, loving things is loving myself!</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Yuan Muzhi's departure from Diantong is likely to become true. It is said that Mr. Ma recently stated that if Yuan Muzhi goes to Japan, the expenses will be borne by him.</p>
<p>There are rumors that Haozi Wu Cun will also go to Beijing with Gao Qianping to work for the Ministry of Railways, which is probably not true.</p>
<p>Wang Manjie, who had four shots in "The Beginning of Man," has also hired a year-round legal counsel.</p>
<p>Feng Chuanren said: Xu Xingzhi's "Pastoral Song" at Yaotong may not be sung. (Note: "Pastoral Song" is Xu Xingzhi's new battle after "Wind Spirit Children," and she is currently working on the script).</p>
<p>Some say that Xu Qi's elopement is inappropriate, saying that it is not the behavior that a "new woman" should have. I don't think so. For the sake of one's own lifelong happiness, resisting the family is extremely reasonable. What is hoped is that Miss Xu will not dream of love above all else.</p>
<h3 id="e215">"The History of Sorrow in the Danish Palace" Chatting <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Comparable to "The Secret History of the English Palace"</p>
<p>British films, because their works are progressing extremely rapidly, have recently occupied a part of the power in the foreign film market. Recently, a grand palace historical film "Loves of A Dictator," has been shipped to China and will soon be shown in Shanghai. This film was directed by the master of British silver altar, Victor Savage, and the main actors are American star Clav Block and British star Marilyn Carroll. When the film was shown at the Roxy, the largest theater in New York, it lasted for a month, and sales did not decline. American newspapers and magazines praised it extremely, and its popularity among American people can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The film cost one million pounds to produce, and its excellence surpasses even the once-sensational "The Private Life of Henry VIII." The content is about a romance in the Danish palace in the eighteenth century. The plot is sad, touching, and humorous, and it is rare to be based on historical facts everywhere. In palace films, it can indeed be regarded as one of the best works. Well, the date of the public release is coming soon, movie fans, wait and see.</p>

Flipping through it at will, you can see the lively expressions and actions of the people in the painting like on the screen. It is truly a good product for entertainment after dinner and wine. If readers need this gift, please pay two cents for postage and send it to the Publicity Department of Mingxing Film Company, Fenglin Bridge, Shanghai, and a copy will be sent to you according to the address.

<p>The anti-drug detective film "Jade Horse" was publicly previewed at the Xinguang Grand Theater the other day, and there were many viewers. Those who came later all stood on tiptoe to watch. The style of this film is innovative, giving viewers a refreshing feeling, and it won a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Mingxing Company will establish a large-scale library in the near future, collecting books and magazines related directly or indirectly to Chinese and foreign films and lightning art, for people to read in their spare time.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's "Boatwoman" has received good reviews after its informal preview at the Central Grand Theater. Some say, "Xu Lai's performance has never been this good." Based on this point, it can be seen that the monster has put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Bu Gao and Xiao Qiu co-directed "Brothers Walk" and will go to Beijing to shoot location scenes.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian has recovered from his illness and went to the company to work. His new work "Love Letter" will begin soon. Someone asked about his condition during his illness, and he said, "I escaped from death."</p>
<p>Wu Cun's "Spring Flower," which he wrote and directed, has passed the review and will be filmed soon.</p>
<p>Since Wu Cun is undertaking part of the work of staging "Curved Moon," Shen Xiling will serve as the director of "The Inspector General" and must bring Gogol's masterpiece under his arm to the company every day.</p>
