<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國重視遠東局勢</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>近二週來。英國政局。似以遠東問題爲其動盪之重心。前首相勞合喬治。最初以警惕之詞句。攻擊西門外相之遠東政策。一九三二年滿洲調查團領袖李頓爵士。復在華盛頓發表其促進英美合作之論調。南菲聯邦斯末資將軍。則更指明目前日本對遠東問題所採取之政策。有令太平洋成爲世界一大危險地帶之嚴重威脅。影響所及。將使中日俄美英諸國以及坎拿大·澳洲·印度·新西蘭·諸自治領捲入漩渦。而消泯此嚴重威脅性之唯一辦法。厥爲英美兩國對世界問題之互相合作。英國輿論。對中國門户之開放。近亦較前注意。僉謂對於最近遠東局勢之推移。在遠東有廣大商業利益之各國。均未容忽視。據本月二十日倫敦路透社電傳。英外相曾與我駐英公使郭泰祺。透澈討論遠東之局勢。其談話内容。雖未經宣露。但最近英國各界對遠東問題之密切注意。與其輿論之足以左右外交。彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>在遠東舞台。英國於歷史上以及政治經濟關係上。本爲最重要之角色。先後三次之英日同盟。劃分勢力範圍圈之英俄。英德密約。莫不以保持在華之優越地位爲其政策之中心。但歐戰以後。英國以海上霸權。蒙受挫折。其在華勢力乃由第一位而退居第二位。同時日本之新興勢力。勃然而起。英對遠東不得不暫取守勢。然其對於在華市塲利益之發展。固未嘗一日忘懷也。</p>
<p>自九一八事變發生以來。英國以在遠東有廣大之利益。其一舉一動。頗足影響遠東時局之推移。徒以過去英日同盟之舊夢難忘。是以互相尊重英日在華利益之聲浪乃起。其後日本志得意滿。竟廣播其獨佔東亞之聲浪。以致遠東問題。益成僵局。或非英國始料所及也。至於美國。則以國内經濟恐慌未减。軍力尚待補充。故對遠東問題。大有鞭長莫及之感。美國最近不得不以睦鄰政策。暫飾其對遠東問題態度之消極。英國亦同時發生不干涉新加坡以北問題之論。以求相安于一時。均由環境關係。不得不然。由是觀之。最近中日關係之所以急轉。其内在原因。固由日本之需要。而客觀環境之推移。實亦不失爲一種重要原因也。</p>
<p>現英國鑒於最近遠東形勢之發展。足以妨害其在華之既得利益。並感到昔日對日拉攏政策。殊非得計。乃始集其注意點於遠東問題。以謀補救。于是。九國公約從新提出。對華政策重加檢討。甚至欲號召列强。形成一堅固之陣綫。以保持其在華之既得利益。此種新矛盾之進展。自亦大堪注目。</p>
<p>吾國處此險惡之環境。進既不能。退又不可。惟有確立堅决不移之方針。以保障我民族之獨立生存。始有勉除列强在華角逐醖釀戰爭之望。雖然。戈林將軍有言。劍失則和平亦失。當兹表面和平之空氣瀰漫東亞之際。吾人對於戈氏此言。有注意之必要也。</p>

<p>西北視察記</p>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>概述新疆近年變亂之經過（二）</p>
<p>哈密於十九年十月間、另劃分宜吾宜禾兩縣治後、至次年二月、正擬着手清丈地畝、而山内纏民忽藉小舖事件、突起騷動此事原因複雜、遠道訛傳、多謂此次改土歸流、分設縣治、即爲事變極單純之動機、實則禍變之醖釀、及其爆發之必然性縱不設縣治、亦必借他事而發、不過適於改治期内猝然發動耳、雖然改治一事、一般纏民、企望多年、因回王極力反對、未獲達到目的、今一旦脱離覊絆、始願以償、自將慶幸不暇、何尚有此事變哉、</p>
<p>緣哈密東西長千餘里、南北寛二三百里、不等、多廣漠、少耕地、回王所食采邑、及所增置地産、約占回部田地十之四五、阡陌縱横、無非膏腴、回部舊制、回王田地、由纏民代耕代穫、又必日派若干人、到王府供差、其供應之繁、即微如掃帚、亦必索於纏民、而其頭目、如大台基·小台基·伯克·大耳瓜·米拉甫·胡而麻·毛蹄子等、所有之地、亦必由各纏民代爲耕穫、每日又須與各頭目家内派供差者數人、計一月中、每户纏民得做自己事者、不過六七日耳、餘均供回王及頭目之差、妻女亦輪流前往執役、各頭目既有莫大之權利、一旦改設縣治、歸縣管轄、不惟向有一切利權、完全喪失、且須與一般纏民同赴縣倉納糧、於是揑造纏民世耕田地將撥漢民耕種、纏民妻女漢民要娶等種種謡言、到處煽惑、一般纏民不明眞相、自相驚擾、紛紛遷徙、公家雖派員極力安撫、究以教俗隔閡、不得與纏民大衆直接解釋、纏民腦筋簡單、以訛傳訛、而事變遂因此勃發矣、</p>
<h3>驍勇的纏兵</h3>
<p>當是時也、回王地畝尚未處分、荒地亦未分撥、事變既日益擴大、關内遠道傳聞、遂亦言人人殊、謂纏民耕種回王地、有准其領照播種者、未種及一部已耕地、有發給甘肅難民種植者、漢民領荒則免徵、與對纏民待遇殊不平等云云、皆虚擬過甚之詞、在擬設伊吾縣治之老毛湖、被害難民、情形最慘、因伊吾縣以墾荒須先開渠、開渠首要人工、乃商租回王老毛湖地三十石、令難民到彼一面種地、一面開渠、俟渠開成分撥荒地、與該處纏民利益初并無碍、不意甫至該處、變亂即起、</p>
<p>所謂小舖事件、係一非教徒之守卡漢軍官、私與纏女結爲夫婦、纏民以有背教規、恨之刺骨、以爲纏民妻女漢民要娶之説、令竟證實、於是一倡百和、羣起暴動、先殺該守卡官兵、次及漢人居户、同時老毛湖·土葫蘆·頭二三三堡等、亦起而響應、中以老毛湖正往種地開渠之難民、全數被植土中、僅露其首、以烈馬横拖巨木、踢踏碾壓而死者爲最慘、哈密東西各驛站、亦先後起事、漢人死傷逃亡、數不可計、屋舍亦被燒燬、至今尚爲坵墟、</p>
<p>環哈密各驛站各分卡之漢官漢民、慘遭禍變者、計十餘處之多、纏民頭目中、原有少數槍械、兼在各處勝利、武器增多、乃糾合羣衆、猛撲哈城、省方接得報告、一面派員宣撫、一面調隊鎮攝、纏民中之年老者、都願在相當條件下表示悔意、已有一部份之自首、但頭目自料事已閙大、即使收束、亦難得省方之諒解、乃陽向省方表示歸順、暗中潛與駐酒泉之馬仲英接洽、請其開兵援助、馬事先曾派人赴哈煽惑、早已蓄意入新、且新敗於馬步芳軍、正苦無處發展、遂於是年（二十年）五月間乘機竄入新疆、圍攻哈密、蹂躪鎮西瞭墩七角井等地、并利用宗教關係、煽惑他處之纏回、省軍開抵哈密、一本「但問匪不匪不問回不回」之省府通電、勦撫兼施、歷時半年之久、仍未平息、嗣因馬本人負傷、退居哈屬之廖家灣、省軍續有東來、哈城更難攻破、復於十月秒逃歸甘境、盤據安·敦·玉·肅·等縣、糾衆養勢、以圖再起、</p>

<p>各界簽名發起者二百人</p>
<p>中國文字、雖有種種優點、然筆劃過於繁多、而手寫體與印刷品又不一律、實爲民衆教育之一大阻力、近年全國有人主張减省漢字筆劃、以謀教學之便利、最近復由文化界人士、共同研究、已歷多時、頃始發表手頭字第一期字彙、各界人士簽名發起者二百人、各文化機關及刊物决定採用者已有十餘家、兹將推行手頭字緣起、及第一期字彙照錄如下、</p>
<p>推行手頭字緣起</p>
<p>我們往常有許多便當的字、手頭上大家都這麽寫、可是書本上並不這麽印、識一個字須得認兩種以上的形體、何等不便、現在我們主張把「手頭字」用到印刷上去、省掉讀書人設憶幾種字體的麻煩、使得文字比較容易識、容易寫、更能够普及到大衆、這種主張從　也有人提出過、可是他們没有實在做、所以没有甚麽影響、現在我們决定把「手頭字」鑄成銅模澆出鉛字來、拿來排印書本、先選出手頭常用的三百個字來作爲第一期推行的字彙、以後再逐漸加添、直到「手頭字」跟印刷體一樣爲止、希望開心文化的先生們、贊同我們的主張、並且儘量採用這個字彙、發起人丁淑靜·萬迪鶴萬家寶·小默·王人路·豐子愷·方光燾·巴金·王紀　·王獨清·王特夫·王國秀·王集從·王屏南·方景略·葉聖陶·朱自清·葉放·左胥之·白薇·葉龢士·朱少卿·朱文叔·任白戈·劉延陵·劉廷芳·劉良模·老舍·余之介·沈子丞·李公朴·吳文祺·沈西苓·沈體蘭·沈志遠·徐澤霖·李長之·米星　·艾思奇·沈兹九·沈起予·李南薌·李冠芳·陸高誼·吳朗西·吳組緗·吳研因·吳清友·蘇雪林·艾寒村·仿聯德·李貽燕·余楠秋·吳敬恒·吳廉銘·沈端先·李輝英·杜鋼百·艾蕪·辛樹幟·汪靜之·吳翰雲·劉薰宇·伯韓·汪馥泉·吳耀宗·邵力子·孟十還·周木齋·周予同·林漢達·林本僑·東平·金兆梓·金仲華·歐陽山·周伯棣·周伯勳·邵宗漢·羅叔和·阿英·邰爽秋·周越然·征農·金燄·胡仲持·胡風·洪深·姚紹華·姜琦·柳湜·范揚·胡愈之·郁達夫·夏丐尊·倪文宙·祝百英·奚如·祝佛朗·馬宗融·草明·唐弢·馬星野·孫俍工·孫師毅·高夢旦·馬國亮·馬國英·席滌塵·高鐵郎·徐蔚南·徐懋庸·郭一岑·章乃器·曹小端·陳子展·張天翼·曹禮吾·陶行知·張仲實·陸衣言·張肖梅·張良輔·陳君冶·陳克承·陳君涵·許幸之·郭沫若·曹亮·陳致道·郭挹清·陳望道·張夢麟·　彬龢·畢雲程·許傑·許達年·許欽文·曹聚仁·陳維姜·陳端志·陸德音·陳樟生·章錫琛·陸錫值·庶謙·張耀翔·黄石·顧君義·傅東華·馮和法·黄素封·舒新城·黄源·程演生·顧樹森·黑嬰·靳以·臧克家·楊青田·楊東蓴·路敏行·葛喬·葛綏成·楊潮·楊騷·楊霽雲·趙義凭·熊昌翼·趙家璧·蒯斯嚑·趙景深·管萃眞·蔡元培·潘公弼·潘式·樊仲雲·鄭君里·鄭伯奇·蔡希陶·魯彦·鄭振鐸·黎烈文·蔣徑三·鄧裕志·樂嗣炳·蔣弼·蔡慕暉·黎錦明·蔣鏡芙·盧冀野·穆藕初·謝六逸·鍾天心·謝扶雅·鍾韶琴·聶紺弩·魏猛克·潭友六·</p>

<h3>潘公展演講上海的學校教育（六）</h3>
<p>都是出在我們一般人民身上、不過這筆賠欵退回、總算外國人頭腦清楚、肯把這筆錢仍舊退回來給你們辦教育罷、他們把這賠欵退回給回給我們辦教育、其意思好像是説、你們從前吃虧、就是因爲你們没受教育、没有知識、但是、美國等等把賠欵退回我們辦教育、我們怎麽樣呢、假使拿着來辦「小學教育」、使每個人家六歲至十二歲的子弟、都有機會而且强迫着進這種小學讀書、不必納費、這是最公道的事情、因爲錢是從四萬萬七千萬國民身上剥去的、現今外國退還我們、也應把錢退回給每個國民、如果辦小學、給大家子女不化錢讀書、這樣一來、多麽公平啊、比了送幾個「天之驕子」的出洋學生、以及辦那「高等教育」、總覺來得切要、像現今没有錢人家的小孩子、他們對於進小學校、連夢想也不必夢想、最可笑的、一方面竟有人拿這種錢做人情、去送戲子出洋、眞是荒乎其唐的事、「滑天下之大稽」、</p>
<p>我們全體知識份子、尤其是全國的小學教員、應該來喚醒社會、使大家來注意「普及教育」、至於「專門教育」、在這一個階段中、不妨姑等我們「初等教育」和「成人教育」普及之後、再謀發展、如果我們向這「普及教育」方面來努力、我相信中國教育纔可完成初步使命、能這樣、國家才有轉機、才有希望、才有她的前途、倘使我們還是敷衍下去、對這問題不敢説話、讓少數人把持、分割壟斷、專用於浮而不實的「高等教育」事業、同時聽任小學校無錢關門、置之不顧、則不但失去對教育所負的使命、也失去教育的本體、如讓牠今年没辦法、明年没辦法、因循急略、那我們辦「小學教育」的人還要辦什麽呢、而且就上海説、格外奇怪、「庚子賠欵」是海關税欵撥出來的、上海的「江海關」是國内數一數二的大關、恐怕上海市民所負擔的關税、一定很多、祇有比别處多、不見得比别處少、但要問退回的庚欵、我們上海市民享受着什麽呢、我們拿回了什麽呢、所以要講「上海的教育」、我認爲照這樣枝枝節節的今年加點錢、明年加點錢、實在不是根本辦法、我們要從大處想法、然後規劃怎樣實事未是的用這筆錢、那末、上海的教育、眞是不到兩三年工夫、就可達到「普及教育」的目的、各位要明白、這一件事、是各省各縣教育的基礎、我曾説過、我不是主張祇要「普多教育」、不要「高等教育」、而以應先該爲重辦注「普及教育、」才能談到「高等教育」、這是很淺的道理、也是一個不可違避的公例、比如靜安寺路二十二層高的國際大飯店、頂高的是屋頂、頂低的是墻脚、請問當日動工建造這所房子的時候、還是先造屋頂、還是先打墻脚、假使的確先造屋頂、那我今天所講的話自甘取消、如果是要先打墻脚、則我的演講或者不是胡主説、務請各位注意、末了、我再鄭重的聲明、先做到「普及教育」、再謀發展「專門教育」、是辦中國教育的不二法門、（完）</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、二月份期貨業已停止、備於二十六日交割、市上祇做三月份期貨一個月、交易大爲清减、每有無人問津者、惟廿三關起伏仍鉅、人心頗見紊亂、隔日多頭、昨日出籠者、頗不乏人、隔日空頭、趁低抵補者、亦頗踴躍、目下之空頭占優勢、與以前之移頭占優勢、同一勝利、而無不在軌外行動、在此論言龐雜之際、趨勢殊難捉摸、難比最高價已小八元半、而以多頭擁擠、蜂湧出籠、打破七十元大關、非不可能、　縱云何哉、其他各種　　、交易既清、漲跌亦徵、惟午後有中英借款成立之　、人心堅强、趨勢前　有轉高之可能、昨日經過、上午開盤、交易最清、裁兵廿關及鹽税三種、均未撤　、紙金短及廿三關交易較多、市價安定、廿三關則又小半元、五十三號頗有吐出、次盤交易仍無起色、編遣一九善甘捲廿關九六等均未有成交、其他各種、亦平疲而已、廿三關經三十一號之瀉出、續跌三角、午後謡傳中英借欵有成立希望、交易驟增、以統税及廿三關爲熱閙、市價大都趨漲五分一角至三角、廿三關又猛跌八角、收盤各帮需要、更見踴躍、大都續堅五分一角左右、廿捲獨好三角半、廿三關則又繼續跌去半元、全日趨跌、竟繼前日之跌停板、續小二元一角半、抬之則錦上添花、撳之則下井投石、投機成份過多、則危險性質亦隨之而增高、盲從者往往焦頭爛額、無法自拔、昨日市價結果、除廿三關外、一律趨漲、一二角至半元許、成交總數、計共八百十六萬六千元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗市</h3>
<p>標紗花每况愈下</p>
<p>紗市因上日二月期收盤情形、益覺衰落、而發現新低峰、然查其交貨、僅二十支到期紗二千包、足見市面之一蹶不振矣、實以金融緊迫、錢莊銀行緊縮、對於信用放欵、不能流通、故商業何能活絡、所以人心一致觀低、市盤乃愈難立足矣、</p>
<p>金雞又跌四六角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈平定之象、但塲中新買者殊覺冷落、二三盤微見上漲一二角、詎收盤忽轉疲弱、形勢又虚、又金價又跌進九百元大關、結果各月均跌二·三角、午後開盤市氣頗虚、賣風尤濃、人心惶惶、以金價大跌、原棉下落、現紗銷路岑寂、但拍至收盤有一部分空頭抵補、又有一説、申新二·五·廠迄今尚未能恢復工作、所以投機抛賣尚鮮、跌勢較棉爲平、結果各月又跌二·三·四角、查賣出長豐四千一百五十包、通記八百包、大豐八百包、達記一千九百五十包、泰昌一千四百五十包、恒昌六百包、大福六百五十包、買進大孚二千五百五十包、通記二千七百五十包、錦昌二千五百包、合興六百包、均昶六百包、大昶一千包、一日間最高低價及收盤如下、</p>
<p>現紗各銷清淡</p>
<p>現紗銷路清淡、較前爲少、查全日各帮買去統計四百九十包、行情跌五角、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>花市趨疲、跌風愈演愈熾、大有江河日下之概、此種情形、全由上年一般人、對於棉花看高心太重、詎料今年經濟恐慌、紗市不起、廠方無力購辦、存棉日積月增、靈寶棉存貨較上週又增一萬餘件、所以現棉情形、殊難穩定、</p>
<p>鄭標再降四五角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、情勢平定、但美棉因華盛頓紀念停市、印棉漲跌互見、二盤各月回漲五分至一角、詎拍至三收盤、市情大變、形勢突見恐慌、人心惶惑、因金市敲破九百元大關、日商有大量的抛出、市盤乃急轉下降、各月均跌一二角至二角半三角、午後開盤市氣愈見驚慌、因日商東棉洋行將靈寶棉削價售出、較去年價跌十元一擔、（上年靈寶棉每擔賣六十四元今售五十四元）於是人心激動、甯波帮抛賣加碼、惟源大逢跌購進、結果各月跌二角半至一角半、查賣出吉豐四千擔、賡豐五千一百擔、均昶二千擔、長豐工千六百擔、信誠四千一百擔、長和四千擔、大豐二千二百擔、達記二千擔、元一四千擔、買進源大七千一百擔、裕康一千六百擔、仁豐二千一百擔、益豐三千二百擔、錦昌一千五百擔、合興一千八百擔、均昶二千八百擔、恒德四千擔、潤康三千五百擔、大昶三千擔、長和二千六百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>原棉廠化杳無起色</p>
<p>現棉消費益覺沉悶、各方銷路杳無起色、來源計姚花五百包、</p>
<p>紗布倉庫存紗統計</p>
<p>華商紗布交易所倉庫中存紗量、至二月二十二日截止、統計一萬五千一百五十五包、查二十支富貴紗爲八千八百二十包爲最巨、其次人鐮紗二千五百四十包、兹將各紗牌及包額摘錄如下、</p>
<p>上海各棧存棉統計</p>
<p>—二月二十二日調查—</p>
<p>美棉停市中之印英棉</p>
<p>昨美棉因華盛頓誕辰、未有市况、英棉市况平穩、現貨不動、期貨漲一二點、印棉先因期貨商賣出而疲、後因出口需要進步及日商買進而回、計平果爾跌一·二五羅比、奧姆辣跌○·二五羅比、白羅溪漲○·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十三日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百四十九羅比、較上日收盤漲二·五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>遠月粉跌勢殊厲</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平靜之象、以洋麥報係芝加哥無市、坎拿大爲四分左右、當開價後、各月份市面、均呈盤旋之態、上落無幾、本月份因交割已近、廠家籌碼、大部分已爲客帮抽去、人心當然安定、遠期則買賣亦寂、市呈穩定、迫至下午開盤、遠期市面、突見暴前、因廠家又續定澳麥一船、價祇四元七角五分半、故廠家抛量甚暢、市價亦即暴瀉二三分、照洋麥之續定、且市值又愈定愈廉、前途不穩之態、或恐難免也、至本月份因現貨不豐、人心尚定、祇較跌一分、三月份跌二分、四月份跌二分七厘半、五月份跌三分、六月份跌三分二厘半、七月份跌三分、</p>
<p>期麥遭洋麥定成影響</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平寂之象、洋麥情形、芝加哥無市、坎拿大祇好四分、當開價後、本月份因係最後一天交易、多空變方、互相了結、故上午開價一角九分、下午收價八角八分、趨勢平穩、遠期各月份、上午市面、尚見定局、下午則因洋麥有續定之訊、市氣轉軟、觀此種情形、後步尚看繼軟也、結果本月份跌二分、三月份跌三分、現麥市、尚見穩定、聞山東歸德麥三元九角二三分、蚌埠麥三元九角、黄橋麥三元九角一分、瑶灣麥三元八角七八分、海州麥三元九角、由申大去四千元、福新去二千元、</p>
<p>洋客秈開價步軟</p>
<p>九江帮有試辦訊</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、以内地帮連日曆辦後、暫有觀望之意、而市上存積既厚、來源又連續不絶、期貨亦有暗中成議、故人心轉虚、客囤均有求脱之意、故晨間開價即軟、比之前市較小五分至一角不等、及至午後突有九江帮到市辦買、市面始得安定、全日開出西貢米七千包、暹邏米一千五百包、除九江試辦少數外、仍係内地本街分去也、</p>
<p>客秈連日以價高滯消、市氣久已不振、本客均注意於中關洋米後、去化更呆、昨日南京辦去機油一百包、内地去機紅一百四十包、未街去糙米二百五十包、價均步落五分云、</p>
<p>河下米到湧再跌</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源忽見轉湧、共到有五十餘號、（貨共近萬石）、而銷塲方面零躉兩胃均續懈淡、致大局形勢頓見疲頽、市色呈下游之態、故各厚粳價削落角半、晚稻貶跌一二角不等也、陰元市亦帶軟、僅變元因聞閘市堅挺、無甚榮辱耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源頗旺、計有四十餘號、市上各貨去胃問津者寥寥、雖有交易極細、市價白粳價小一角左右、薄稻高料疲勢、中次小近角、其餘各色均帶疲象、客尖去路有限、其價無甚上落、</p>
<p>麩皮洋莊去化呆</p>
<p>昨日麩皮市面、微見軟懈、因洋莊去胃、未見甚暢、雖掮客兜售、洋麥亦少注意、祇聞三四月份之遠期貨、正在談判、將來或有大批成交、至現麩喊價、昨小二分半、開過二元七角二分半、</p>
<p>廣帮豆銷强健</p>
<p>昨日黄豆在各路銷塲活潑之下、行情續見轉砌、去路方面、推廣帮爲最、昨計辦去大連四平街豆十八九車、價做四元三角半至二角七、又取開源豆二車、價扯四元五角、范家屯豆一車、價亦開四元五角、廠家辦去郯城豆六百餘包、價爲三元九角半、蚌埠豆四車、價扯三元七角三分半、穎州豆二車、價扯三元八角三分半、歸德豆二車、價爲三元九角、本街内地採辦漢口乍豆二千餘包、價自三元六角八至五角半、内地去漢口遲豆三百餘包、價扯三元六角二分、</p>
<p>三月份内外國債地方公債還本付息表</p>
<p>（説明）（一）票面每百元之現負本金或連號每百個（或千個）之未抽中支數（二）票面每百元之應付本息數或連號每百個（或千個）之應抽出支數、（三）換券後另換新號碼（四）應還本金實數自九萬一千元至十一萬一千元、（五）總額四千萬元、（六）籤支共千個、號碼取末尾三位、（七）應還本金實數爲十九萬五千元或二十萬五千元、（八）總數一千四百號每次抽還十四分之一、計一百號、</p>

<h3>「想」和「做」</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>有人説：「英國人做了不説，德國人做了才説，日本人説了就做，中國人説了不做。」小朋友！你聽見過嗎？中國人説了不做，這句話你相信嗎？你看了下面的事實，必無異議的。</p>
<p>我回憶三四年前，在小學裏讀書的時候，每次遇到什麽紀念呀！運動呀！總是發傳單，貼標語，手執旗幟，在街市中，奔走呼喊着：「大家救國，大家救國！」狠熱烈的口號，可是越來越淡了，到現在呢？却完全聽不到了。更有人主張，禦外要這般這般，救國要那樣那樣，説得天花亂墜，這的確是救國的極好的方法，然而在事後有誰去做呢？</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！我們要知道呀！任何一件事，必先有想，然後照着預定計劃做去，並且想和做絶對不能分家的，否則，結果想是空想，做是白做，幾次落空，誰不要灰心呢？所以我希望你們記好，「我們要用我們的手來做，不要用我們的口來講。」</p>
<h3>蘇俄的青年發明家</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們近來翻看報紙，可看見些值得我們敬伂的新聞嗎？倘没有看見的話，我現在告訴你們：</p>
<p>「蘇俄的京城莫斯科舉行全聯邦兒童機械工程製造品展覽會、内有兒童發明品二千種，像列甯格拉亞克維特，年紀祇有十五歲，發明電力煤氣爐一種。兒童發明家中，以杜拉地方的伊略欣司基弟兄最有名氣，其中有一個小兄弟，十一歲，已經發明街燈自動開關機。他的哥哥，十二歲，發明電氣爆乾底片機。其他像巴希基利亞的拉美夫，十五歲，發明無線電火車。」</p>
<p>我看了這一節新聞，一方面覺得十二分的敬佩，一方面又是十二分的慚愧。</p>
<p>敬佩的是像這樣小小年紀的兒童，已經能够發明科學的器具，貢獻於社會。</p>
<p>慚愧的是想到我國，不但没有這樣的兒童能發明這種器具。連一般成年人，也没有幾個能發明的，大概只有百分之九十九，簡直不是發明，不過改造改造罷了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！努力呀！現在的世界不比以前的世界了！快快把一切有用的科學智識，儘多的灌進腦海裏去！凡是學校裏算術，物理，化學等科目，必須一百二十分的用心研究，學成之後，將來便可立足於社會之中，而不致於被淘汰了</p>
<h3>速成樂器</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>小兄弟·小妹妹。今天我想出一個極簡單有趣味的樂器。這樂器，無論何人可以立刻會做成的，而且比木做的琴，聲音還凖，請諸位立刻試騐一下：就是用同大同高的玻璃杯八隻，並列在泉上，（杯與杯離開一寸，先把右面第一杯，注清水九分滿，第二杯注八分滿，第三杯注七分滿，第四杯注八分滿，第五杯注五分滿，第六杯注四分滿，第七杯注三分滿，第八杯注二分滿，就是從第一杯到第八杯所注的水，逐漸减少水的分量，然後用鉛律或筷輕敲杯邊，那末，就變爲1,2,3,4,5,6,7,i,八個音調了。其右邊第一杯，因注了九分的水，杯的振動數爲多，所以發出高音i,左邊第一杯（即從右邊數到左邊的第八雙）因爲注水最淺，敲之發出最低的音，倘若聲音欠凖，應當把水加减分量，總可以對凖1,2,3,4,5,6,7,i,八個字音的。假使要添加高音2,3或低音5,6,7等音，再在左右兩端，多添幾隻杯就可。若是多排兩列的杯，用兩手同敲同音的杯，那與彈風琴的聲音，是一樣的。所以這個速成的樂器，隨時隨地可以立刻做成，而且不費錢，不費力，眞正便利得很，不過敲時要當心，不可敲得太重，免得將玻璃杯敲破呢。</p>
<h3>兒童歌</h3>
<p>— 增瑞</p>
<p>兒童們！大家上前！</p>
<p>祇一人第一，要個個爭先。</p>
<p>勝固然可喜，敗也要欣然。</p>
<p>兒童們，大家上前，</p>
<p>兒童們！大家齊心！</p>
<p>將來的主人，由我們充任！</p>
<p>祖國的光榮，要我們增進，</p>
<p>兒童們！大家齊心！</p>
<h3>懶惰的鳥</h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>夏天，天氣是非常的暖和，大地上滿是青綠色的樹木，百花怒放着，開出美麗的花朶。許多懶惰的鳥，成羣結隊，很快樂的在天空中飛舞着，它們唱着歌，一些也不顧慮到食糧的缺乏，因爲大地正像一個大倉庫，佈滿了它們所要吃的東西，任隨它們的選擇，不需要費一點心力的。有些勤儉的鳥雀們，正在忙着造巢和儲藏糧食，它們却嘲笑着説：</p>
<p>「傻子們，這樣美麗的快樂的辰光，你們忙些什麽？」</p>
<p>不久，冬天到了，樹木落盡了葉子，花朶都萎謝了，天氣是非常寒冷，西北風怒吼着，池子裏結滿了冰，銀白色的雪蓋滿了世界。那些懶惰的鳥都凍得索索的抖着，它們再不唱歡樂的歌了，只是哀號着，彷彿在説：</p>
<p>「天氣太冷了，我們要凍了，我們要餓死了。」</p>
<p>那些勤儉的鳥雀，却登在暖和的窠裏，吃着鮮美的夏天儲藏起來的糧食，它們啁啾的呌着，也彷彿在説：</p>
<p>「幸虧我們在夏天辛苦地造好了窠，儲好了糧食，否則這時候就要凍死餓死，還能如此快樂嗎？」</p>
<p>没有多少時候，那些懶惰的鳥已凍死在白色的雪地上了。</p>

<h3>兒童科學講座「物體的力」</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>—動力的反動力—</p>
<p>兩件物證，互相推，或互相拉的時候，一定會發生兩種力量來。醫如我們拿皮球擲到墻壁上，有一種力量。墻壁當然也有一種力量反應在皮球上。前一種擲的力量，在物理上叫做動力：後一種墻壁上反應出來的，叫做反動力。這兩種力昨，在划船的時候，更可以明顯的表示出來。船夫拿槳推水，水就有同樣的力量來推槳。所以划槳的時候，一划一停，停的時候，槳必提出水面，使水反推槳的力量低推在船身上，這樣船就前進。否則，這反動力着在槳上，槳被推進，船身反而不動了。</p>
<p>這物體的兩種力，表現在某種運動中，有時是不大看得明白的，好像我們在跳高的時候，用力在地上一躍，這就是動力。但身體向上跳起來時，大家都以爲這還是跳高人所用的力量，其實，這是錯誤極了。跳高人所用的力量，僅僅是到了着地的時候爲止：以後身體向上的力量，是地面的反動力。我併居跳繩的時候，也就是利用這種地面的反動力，（圖一）所以就不覺得十分疲倦。可是，這種力量，我們不能明顯的觀察出來，我們把它忽略過去了。</p>
<p>我們再看（圖二）所示的，兩手推着桌子，却能連帶把椅子也推開，這是什麽緣故呢？很明白的，當然也是反動力的關係。因爲手的動力施在桌子上，桌子就發生反動力量來推手。手不斷的施着動力，所以反動力便反應在椅子上，把椅子推開了。（圖三）的花炮，如果拿鐵絲做了中心軸，使它能旋轉，等火星發出來的時候，我們可以看見花炮的轉動，和火星的方向是相反的。（圖四）的盪秋千，也是同樣的證明。（圖五）的試騐，比較更有趣味了。你在秤台上秤凖身體的重量以後，再把兩手突然高舉，這時評計的重量，使立刻增加，這是什麽原因呢？這也是反動力的關係。因爲我們的兩手高舉，身體的重心就向上，它的反動使身體下壓，因此，秤計上的重量，便突然增加。</p>
<p>小朋友，物體受了動力，必然發生反動力，他們的關係，也和我們身體的形影不一樣，一刻也不能分離啊！</p>
<h3>結冰爲什麽凍破瓶呢</h3>
<p>— 甯自强</p>
<p>寒暑表到了冰點以下，便要結冰了，水爲什麽會結冰呢？他的理由是：在冰點以下，水將由液體變成固體，這個體就是水的物理變化呀：</p>
<p>我們知道，凡物熱則澎漲，冷則收縮，在金屬固然是如此，即裝寒暑表的水銀，亦莫不如此，可是水結爲冰，不但不收縮，而且反澎漲，惟其如此，所以瓶内的水，凝結成冰以後，便被漲破了</p>
<p>小朋友：這些平常的學理，不經人道破，便一輩子知其然而不知其所以然，像凍破瓶子這一類的事情，便是一個大大的笑話：大大的疑團！</p>
<h3>米老鼠推車</h3>
<p>— 冲</p>
<p>小朋友！你的爸爸不是常常帶你去看電影的嗎？看電影的時候，在未做正片以前，不是有一段滑稽有趣的米老鼠嗎？現在的米老鼠就是在你們在影戲裏面所看見的。</p>
<p>工具的材料：剪刀一把，鉛筆一枝，毛筆，硯台，墨，橡皮各一樣，馬糞紙一張，（要厚的）或老皮鞋盒子也可代用。白紙一大張，漿糊，鉛絲，（一尺長，要粗的，）或者銅絲也可代用。</p>
<p>以上的工具和材料都找到了，然後做起來。在做的時候，要細心，先把厚的馬糞紙，照甲，乙，丙，丁，戊，剪好了，再貼上白紙，再用毛筆照圖一一塗上。甲要剪四張，做四個車輪。乙要剪一張，做米老鼠的脚。丙二張，做在兩面的外表面。丁三張貼在二張丙的裏面。戊三張也貼在二張丙的米老鼠裏的裏面。以上的手續完了，然後做那四個車輪，把那鉛絲（或銅絲）穿在車箱的四面。再把（乙）即米老鼠脚，脚在米老鼠的（己）孔的裏面。照樣的裝好了之後，再把那一根紗綫（或洋綫）穿在車箱的前面，就可以用它來托動這輛車子，因爲車輛轉動的時候，米老鼠的脚民隨之而轉動，看上去好像在走動一樣？因爲這個原因，就好像在推動這輛車子了。（圖庚）</p>
<h3>跳繩</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>跳繩是冬天一種取暖的東西，我想：諸位小朋友！一定都會的了，還何用説得？這玩意兒雖是平庸簡易，倒也很有價值。它能增進我們的健康，訓練我們的肌肉，所以關於它的理論和方法，很有一番介紹的必要。</p>
<p>爲甚麽跳繩可使我們健康呢？要知道它能震動我們的内臟器官，使之有相當的刺激，不致停滯其作用，要是天天這樣，加緊它們的工作，體内廢物盡量排泄，消化作用又復加增，那末，我們身體怎會不健康呢？同時，肌肉也可以堅實起來，尤其在腿部的肌肉，不但可使它發達，還可練習它的持久性，不會跳繩的人，往往跳不到數下，便覺疲乏。但慣跳的人，每次至少可以跳數十百下，這就可表示他肌肉持久性强了。走起長路來，也比較不容易覺得腿酸吧！</p>
<p>跳法有單脚雙脚的分别，雙脚爲兩脚一同舉起，離地跳躍，讓繩子剛好從足下套過，如果跳得低，繩子慢一點，反之，可以快一點，但是，繩子只要碰着地一小部分，若讓一大段繩子拖在地上，則阻碍跳時的速率，所以只要剛剛套過頭脚便最適當，有了相當熟習之後、就可以移步單脚跳，只須脚向前舉高些或向後屈深些，這樣對腿部筋肉，更有益處，並且胸部，也要挺出，才合衛生</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們已明瞭跳繩的理論和方法，不妨在這冬天去試一下吧！</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（七）</h3>
<p>— 青心</p>
<p>他們把所可取得的寶石都得到了，我們就離了那地方來到海岸，上了一般船。</p>
<p>從那邊我們來到羅哈島，島上生着一種樹是供給我們樟腦的。這些樹很大，樹枝很粗，一百個人儘可很舒服的休息在樹蔭之下。在這島上我瞧見一頭極大的野獸。鼻子上有一隻角，稱爲犀牛。</p>
<p>在這個所在，我又買了幾包貨物，加上我所有的寶石，心想在我們一路回去所經過的各地，做些兒賣買。</p>
<p>我們只作小住，就一路到别的島上去，末後我便非常快樂的到了白爾沙拉着便從那邊動身往巴克達。</p>
<p>我有很大的財産，因傳施與窮人，把餘下來的錢，决意在家中過一個安靜的生活。</p>
<p>辛白德的第三次航行</p>
<p>當時我正在少壯之年，因此不久便覺得巴克達的生活在我過於懶怠了。我不再想到危險，就買了貨物，搭了一艘船，重又從白爾沙拉出發了。</p>
<p>我們進了好幾個港口，每到一處，我總做一批很好的買賣。一天，我們正遠在海中，却有大風雨襲來，那船便迷失了路了。那暴風刮了幾天，末後我們便被吹在一個奇怪的島上，我們在那邊，即忙繫住在港中，不然，我們的船就得喪失了。</p>
<p>我們的船主不喜歡這所在，他對我們説此地是住野人的，他們的皮膚上生着厚厚的紅毛。他説這些人要是到船上來時，我們不可作戰，只索立時投降，否則就於我們更爲不利。</p>
<p>他説：「我們倘殺死了一個矮人，那麽其餘的矮人，就立刻攻擊我們，决不肯放過我們的。」</p>
<p>這些話使我們很憂慮，又充滿了恐怖，不多時我們就瞧到他所説的話是千眞萬確的。一羣的矮人，多半像野獸而不像人類，一起游泳到船邊來。</p>
<p>他們游泳到這船邊來時，就和我們説話，但那所説的方言是我們所不知道的</p>

<h3>娜拉在中國</h3>
<p>— 兹九</p>
<p>易卜生的「娜拉」，在五四時代，曾掀　進中國人的腦海，衝破過部分的衛道防綫。它，被時代的青年男女們愛讀，模演，已是史的陳跡了。</p>
<p>然而「娜拉」之在中國，正像其他革新事務同樣，受着逆潮的友擊，在向後歸回。去年春間，有人提出：娜拉應該忍辱悔過，好好地重回到老家的妙論。正是一個明證。</p>
<p>在此孟姜女還魂被讚，寡婦再醮被逐，姨太太自殺被頌揚的現時代下，「娜拉」重上舞台，常然又是烏烟瘴氣中的一個驚人霹靂了。</p>
<p>最近京滬報載，南京興中門小學教員王光珍女士，因扮演「娜拉」，被解職，其餘飾配角的亦先後受罰，這趣劇出演於大羅村或什麽島上，本無可怪，無奈徧出自新中國新京都的南京，未免太使人遺憾；幸喜南京的文藝界，話劇界，甚至在政務悾惚中的某次長，也起來大抱不平，足證新中國尚没有完全被古灰瀰覆。</p>
<p>只是輿論的抱不平，認爲王光珍女士們：是爲了藝術而被犧牲，他們爲了維獲藝術，才大興問罪之師。</p>
<p>然而實質上，這不是藝人之被摧殘的問題，而是社會對婦女界重加鎖鍊：所以這不是王光珍個人的受辱，而是整個婦女界之被殘踏的問題，在這逆潮的旋渦中，婦女們不乖乖地躲在家裏，做個玩物，而要抛頭露面向外奔，奔上舞台，奔上社會的挣軋綫，自然會被衛道諸公，以及他們的傀儡們——如某小學校長之流——認爲應嚴予處罰的了！不過黑暗是明光的絶好對比，處在黑暗中的人們，她們的希求光明，必較處在半明不暗中的更來得迫切；受重大刺激的，她的反抗，也會更有力量吧！在不悲觀之下，生出了以下的一個小小希望：</p>
<p>『中國已出走的娜拉，以及尚未出走的娜拉，醒來吧！你們應該認識這是什麽時代，你們不該再莫名其妙地做着「小松鼠，不懂事的孩子………」而該認識自己是人，更應該有堅强的意志，不怕苦難，集中力量，來與這重壓抗爭。這才是新中國所需要的娜拉』</p>
<h3>婦女問題講座</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>第二節　怎樣研究婦女問題</p>
<p>有些人以爲在中國，婦女問題的研究已經不少了，關於牠的理論已經很够了，剩下來的祇是實踐，這未免是過甚其辭的偏見！假便説：「祇剩下實踐」，那末，「理論」亦仍然跟「實踐」同樣剩下着！爲什麽？因爲離開實踐的理論是觀念論者的空談。所謂「理論」祇能在實踐中生長，發展！</p>
<p>在中國，關於婦女問題的理論，固然不少，而且其研究已有數十年之歷史，但過去的理論，也就是過去的婦女運動的實踐所産生出來的東西。我們要曉得，所謂實踐是跟着歷史的發展而發展，牠是不斷的轉換其方向的。所以過去的理論，未必就能完全適合於現在的實踐，反之，現在的實踐却也能産生出適應於現實的新的理論來！</p>
<p>很顯然的，現在許多婦女運動者，還保持着五四運動時代的關於婦女問題的見解。就是説，她們仍然夢想着在現存狀態之下，要使婦女獲得和男子完全平等的社會地位，而且她們確信這個可能。她們以爲，雖則在現狀下，但婦女能獲得參政權，教育權，職業權等等，則不難在社會上和男子並駕齊驅。這種見解，不免不是欺人的謬見。五四運動以來，我們是經騐了一九二六——二七的慘酷的大革命，到現在，更經騐着所謂復古運動的激浪侵襲到我們婦女身上的可怕的危機。在這種時代的轉變中，我們可以很明顯的看出，男子中心的社會所給予婦女的一些權利，就是等於好看而不好吃的圖畫中之蘋果。</p>
<p>中國的婦女運動，原是在一九二七年大革命以後已經有了本質的轉變。許多前進的婦女運動者，早就放棄了狹義的女權主義或男女同權主義，而把婦女問題當作社會問題的一環，更進一步，要從整個社會的變革中去求得婦女問題的解决，這是值得注目的一個轉變，可是，關於這一方面的理論的研究很是缺乏。在市面上流行的許多關於婦女問題的書籍中，最值得介紹的只有倍倍爾的婦人與社會，和奧姆蘇的婦女問題講話………等數種讀本，此外雖有些較有價值的關於婦女問題的論文，但這些都祇能述明婦女問題的一部面，没有整個的統一的把牠敘述。這樣看來，婦女問題的研究，在中國已經進到了新的階段，而關於這一新階段的理論的研究，無疑的還很需要！</p>
<p>婦女問題的研究，也和研究其他一切社會問題同樣，必須應用唯物辯證的方法才能得到正確的認識。因爲祇有牠才能闡明事物的本質，及其生成與發展的過程。同時我們必須站在史的唯物論的見地去觀察婦女問題，因爲祇有這樣才能正確的認識婦女在各時代各社會的生活情形，與及婦女被男子抑壓的原因與結果。</p>
<p>婦女問題的研究範圍是很廣泛的。除了一般的歷史的及現實的問題而外，還須要男女兩性的生物學上的探討。從來，研究婦女問題的人，常常碰到兩種難於説明的論敵，其一是現象論者，他們好像古代希臘的哲學者把奴隸當作天定的下賤者一樣，把數千年來婦女在男子支配底下所强迫負擔的家庭奴隸的任務，看做應當如此的「天職」，而對於男子的支配要給以一種理論的根據。其二是自然主義者，他們站在生物學乃至生理學的見地，説明婦女的劣等地位的由來，他們也和現象論者同樣，把婦女在數千年來男子支配底下被馴養而劣弱化的生理現象，當作天賦的弱者的特性，而將婦女的劣等地位使之合理化，以企圖男子中心社會的恒久的存續。但這些『理論』都在史的唯物論者的光芒之下畢竟會暴露出牠的原形來！</p>
<p>在這裏，我想要講述的範圍是非常的廣泛，先從兩性問題的生物學的觀察説起，講述有史以前及以後各時代各社會婦女的生活情形，其次，把近代主要各國的婦女運動及其思潮加以簡單的介紹與批判，最後要論述現階段的中國婦女運動的動向以作結語。然而，這講述却遭遇了兩種不可避免的障礙，第一是本講座的篇幅有限，不能盡量發揮所蒐集的資料，第二，因爲本講座是週刊，爲着讀者的便利，必須使每一節文章保有獨立的價值，因之恐將有損於整篇文章的統一的體系。除了這兩種困難外，還有講者自身的講述上的技術問題，就是説講者自身不會寫大衆化的文章而使講話不能通俗，這一切須在這兒聲明，並請讀者們原諒！</p>
<h3>我們所更應努力的</h3>
<p>— 蓮蕊</p>
<p>在理論上，現在已有不　的人承認男女在性的解放上是應該受同樣待遇的，而且也有好些人主張對這一原則努力實踐。祇是一遇到事實則不論是新人物舊人物都會顯出封建意識來。</p>
<p>譬如説，一般人無論怎樣不滿意某男子的性道德，但如果他有學問有頭腦，他們還是讓他在社會上活動。如果是一個女子，則不論那女人有多少高深的學問，多少偉大的幹才，多少熱烈的　務犧牲精神，祇要她在性關係上有一點可以吹毛求疵的地方，人們就會將她從三十天的神座上拖下來，推她進十八層地獄去。好像女人一失了節或失了貞，就不成其爲人了！</p>
<p>如果要求女子守片面道德的祇是男人，倒也情有可原，叫人更覺得難堪的，是身受舊禮教壓迫的女人們自己，也時常會用極嚴酷極少同情的態度來摧殘譏訕不幸的同性！實在有好些時候，女人比男人還兇惡。難道自己做養媳婦時被婆婆苛待過的人，就一定要在做婆婆時向下一代報仇嗎？難道自己不得自由，自己得不到性的滿足的人，就不能抑制對别人的妒嫉嗎？</p>
<p>這一次明令驅逐危文繡的青島市府，差不多已動了大家的公憤，以後也許不會有同樣的事情發生了。祇是那些祇用蔑視的眼光來刺傷不幸的女人們的一般人，却還要繼續不斷地行施她們的使命。在過去，已經逼迫過幾千萬個危文繡遁入空門或憤世自殺，在以後也還要逼迫幾千萬個危文繡遁入空門或憤世自殺。被青島市府驅逐出境還可以在别的境内卜居，被一般的人蔑視則是到處皆然的，是無法逃避的。因爲將性關係看爲各人的私事，不想以維護風化自居的人，到底是少數中的小數呵。</p>
<p>所以我以爲有覺悟的姊妹們，除了反抗那些壓迫婦女的朋令之外，更應該努力去剷除一般人的封建思想，因爲那是更基本的更普遍的桎梏，非設法將它挣脱是永遠不得解放的。</p>
<p>我有一個小朋友，性格非常抑鬱，在不久以前惠肺癆死去了。據我的考察，造成她抑鬱性格的主因，是因爲她從小受多了别人的鄙視，原因是她做了再嫁的母親的「拖油瓶」。在那腐舊的社會裏，再嫁者的女兒尚且要受了這樣大的痛苦，再嫁者本人所受的，又該是多麽大！被壓迫的姊妹們，讓我們大家努力做點剷除封建思想的工作罷，一面固然是救「未亡人」，一面也就是救那些「未亡人」的兒女呵！除了爲感情的緣故而自願守寡外，難道還有第二個應該守寡的理由嗎？</p>
<h3>「女人是水做的」！</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>作爲曹雪芹先生之女子哲學觀的代言人，紅樓夢裏的賈寶玉，曾經説過這樣的話：「女人是水做的，男人是泥土做的。」引申起來，他的結論該是：「所以女子是冰雪聰明，柔情如水；而男子是粗拙滯重，拘泥難通。」這或許是對女子們有意的捧塲（？），所以每爲一般紅學者所樂道。尤其因爲在某種觀點上，對一般男女的個性，有著精刻的形容，而被大家奉爲趣味的不朽的名言。</p>
<p>這裏，且撇開關於男子的一半部分不談，僅想就，「女人是水做的」這句話，從新加以明確的辯析：</p>
<p>在培培爾著「婦人與社會」一書裏，也曾一再説到「婦人身上各部分的筋肉，都是柔弱而富於水分」；「女子血液中所含水分，多於男子」；「因爲心臟小，脈管細，血液中水分多，故女子同化作用較弱，吸收營養分較少」等語。那麽「女人是水做的」一説，雖不能據此全般肯定：而她們身上所含水的分量要比男子爲多，却已有著科學的根據。因之，我們對於在同樣是血肉之軀的男女中，却辨分爲一是泥土做，一是水做的；這位曹先生的肉眼透視力眞不能不致出奇的佩服。而同時，對被確證了的自身缺陷，—永遠劣等，永遠不能與男子抗爭的身體上的弱點的「源泉」，引致了深切切的憾意。（反對男女同權的主要理由，是，女子的智力體力不及男子，不能負起支持社會的重任：水的成分多，不顯然是女子體力不如男子之一明證？）</p>
<p>然而你如果稍稍有點生物學的常識時，你讠很平易地記起今日踡　歛翅，馴伏地被　　着的家禽，牠們的先祖　是曾有過翺翔自由於　野之間的光榮的適去：你也該知道，今日被小孩子們也承認爲人類的鼻祖的猿猴之類的敏捷猱升的本領，是再難找出在牠們後代的身上。這都證明了環境與能力之消長有著密切的關聯。不論是植物，或動物，在有利的條件之下，則生機暢遂；反是，則生機阻滯，乃至於滅亡，這是人人不能否認的客觀的事實。在人類，萬物之靈的人類，表現於不同的生活狀態的反應，也是同樣的明顯：因了榮養，肉體，及精神上的教養，及職業等之差異，能使血液，腦髓，體格等等起激劇的變遷，這是必然的定論。</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以進一步就婦人地位的變遷而爲史的觀察：</p>
<p>根據人類學，古代著作或歷史紀載，誰也不能否認，在原始社會，女性曾有過相當時期的活躍。那時候，不但男女的能力，（肉體的和精神的）在本質上是一樣—大家是强健而粗野；而且在有的塲合，女性還更表現着超於男子的驚人的事實。相應於女性的活躍而形成的母權制度，正是鐵樣的史跡。</p>
<p>其後，因了兩性間的分業增進，男子逐漸成爲工具和土地的所有者；到進一步男性完全支配了一切，於是女子亦遂一降而淪爲男性的從屬。同時，男子們爲了維護自己永久的權益與威嚴，一方定下要求婦女們遵守的嚴厲的教條；一方施展着使婦女漸歸馴順的，哄騙，籠絡，珍愛（像憂一朶花，一隻鳥樣的珍愛）……等等柔韌的軟索。</p>
<p>爲使牠的主人得以安心出外，女子應該沉靜地守在家裏；爲博牠的主人肯於寵愛有加，女子應該柔順地愛人撫弄，順應着這些要求，女子該有一付優柔的體態，小巧的身手，細膩有脂膚。同時爲了養成斯文一抹，牠們離開了粗蠻的工作；爲了供奉主人，她們節减着豐腆的食物，…………。這樣，久而久之，牠們的骨格漸趨細小，肌肉日臻柔弱，而所謂造成女子的原料，水，遂很自然地超越過男子而有着較大的百分比。談話一句：爲了幾千年來受男性之支配，女性在心理的或生理的發達上，是那麽樣逐漸地，逐漸地起了與男性愈趨不同的差異，所以水的成分在女子身上特别富多，自有其深長的淵源；正和其他的感情，思想，行動，智能的一般低下同樣有其素因！</p>
<p>然而可悲的是：女子們却正沾沾自喜於自己的「是水做」。她們忽視了先祖們英偉壯健的歷史，而反自命地以柔弱流麗爲本色或相炫耀。因了水樣的輕盈瑩澈而受了多少人的侮蔑也自甘低頭承受。人家要捧你，便被瓶花似的珍供於几席之間；人家要貶你，喝一聲回廚房去，便伏伏帖帖地做灶下婢。正像水性的習於下流一般，女子們要於被支配，被奴使，被玩弄，被鄙薄的地位，就一般現狀看，是表現得每况而愈下了。</p>
<p>女性應該永遠自認「是水做的」而優柔寡斷，不思堅强奮發嗎；女性應該永遠給人利用「因器爲形」的弱點，（在有些人正以爲是優點）而加以隨意的擺佈與範籌嗎？女性應該永遠順受惡勢力的冲激而隨波浮沉嗎？社會的變革，會使健全的女性漸變爲柔順弱小而無能；另一相反的社會的變革，也會使女性復歸於矯健英勇而有爲。到社會一般狀態健全時，女性各方面的發達，一定能躋於最高的水凖；那時候所欣懌的，又豈僅是免除了「是水做的」一句幽默性的侮辱的説明而已呢？</p>
<p>新社會的基礎，是鋼鐵樣的生活。努力建造自己，就是建造新社會！新社會的完成，同時就是女性最高人格的完成！</p>
<h3>小秀</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>「你呌什麽，妞子？」</p>
<p>「小秀。爲什麽一定要問呢？」</p>
<p>「知道了名子，以後來麻煩時也好有個禮兒啦！」</p>
<p>在十字路口的路角開紙烟店的十六歲的小秀幾乎每天道麽和人答問着，她習慣了和那些車夫，小販苦力們説説笑笑，他們是她大部分的主雇。</p>
<p>小秀的紙烟　　不是有門有窗的屋宇也没有招牌，却是一個可以推動的警亭一樣的小木頭房子，矮矮的屋頂遮住了風雨，板子的一面可以推開，小秀的腦袋便探出在那兒，眼睛靜靜地啾着外面。板子的内面看得見紙烟洋火，全是十幾枚到三十枚十售的劣等香烟，小秀知道即使預備了好的也没人買的，這些使着大勁旋轉過生活的輪盤的朋友們是没有那麽大的奢想的。</p>
<p>從早到晚，小秀躲在那小板屋裏，只在吃飯的時候，像雀子一樣跳出來跑到隔不了十步路一個小舖買菜頭買烙餅，一回身，便又坐在小屋僅有板凳上了。有時，如土和賣白薯賣硬麵糜糜的換點東西吃。</p>
<p>「不够哩，妞子，别太狠心啊，我給你的烤白薯够三大枝的哩！怎的只給我兩支烟？」</p>
<p>小秀抿着下辱：</p>
<p>「你才狠心哩，算了，再給你一支！什麽滋味呵！」</p>
<p>小秀是不懂得爲什麽這些人喜歡分一部分用血汗換來的錢在這上面，她是花了不少工夫在替别人打算事情的，譬如説：老張的破得遮不住耳朶的帽子該換一頂了，小五那麽瘦小不該推那幾百斤重的土車，德順的咳嗆治………</p>
<p>也有人在替小秀打算的。</p>
<p>「你的家呢？聽口音也就像二百里以内的，不出河北！」</p>
<p>小秀答膩了這問題，便不耐煩的：</p>
<p>「誰管呢，我也不知道啦，只知道姑媽是保定府人。我除了她，一個親人也没有。」</p>
<p>小秀不説假話，她是由姑媽領大的，姑媽用夜晚打草繩的錢喂養大了小秀，連這小板屋的本錢全是她給籌的，小秀到夜晚邊不回去，小店也得有人守啊。只姑媽十天半月地打城外來瞧瞧小秀，拿個十吊八吊走，嘴角上印着笑渦，暗誇自己有主意。</p>
<p>可是，小秀的買賣興隆竟招來了禍殃。</p>
<p>十字路口那崗警每天用直射的眸子瞧住小秀。這是一個并不熱閙的十字路口，到夜晚只有崗警伴着街車與小販，暗暗的燈光是更顯出了夜來的寂寞的。</p>
<p>飈風的那天晚上，崗警敲着小秀的板室，時候是過了午夜，街上連個鬼影子都没有。</p>
<p>「開開門囉！」聲音是那麽貪婪的。</p>
<p>小秀弄清了是誰，便問：</p>
<p>「爲什麽有警亭子不獃？」</p>
<p>「太冷哪！」</p>
<p>輕搥着板門，終於崗警氣慣地走開了，每個細胞裏塞了火星。他等着換班。</p>
<p>離開那夜的第四天，小秀的紙烟店被封門了，人被提了去審訊，罪名是有傷風化，以開紙烟店爲名，誘致一般苦力小販。</p>
<p>小板屋被小秀的姑媽推了走，她凖備着等女孩子回來再到東城任何路角去擺攤。</p>
<p>然而傳來的消息是分罰五塊錢才放人出來，於是小木板屋出賣了。</p>
<h3>再醮婦女在梅縣</h3>
<p>— 林小琴</p>
<p>——迷信與舊禮教的狼狽爲姦——</p>
<p>廣東梅縣算是一個比較開通的地方，但是舊禮教的勢力，差不多仍舊佔據全部社會。婦女們以「從一而終」「烈女不事二夫」「嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗」等説爲金科玉律。婦女對於她自己的婚姻無論多麽不滿意，絶對不敢由她提出離婚的要求來：死了丈夫的婦女也不敢再嫁。其實婦女們何嘗甘心情願受痛苦，不過社會上歧視離婚，或者再嫁的婦女，有使人更難受的地方，所以甯可屈服了。其次，社會上還用迷信的方法來恐嚇婦女，使她們不敢存離婚或再嫁的念頭。</p>
<p>舊禮教是殘酷的，不合人道的，人們對於牠不免要發出「爲什麽要這樣」的疑問來。舊禮教的維持者覺得理由不能折服人的時候，就利用迷信來做維持的工具。可憐缺乏智識的人們竟俯首帖耳受了欺騙！</p>
<p>我現在把梅縣婦女離婚再嫁的舊俗寫出來，做事實的佐証，或者也可以供社會學者作研究的材料。</p>
<p>（一）有夫之婦的改嫁　一個不幸的女子，從生出來，她的父母便把她嫁給人家，做童養媳，或做等郎嫂（没有兒子，先有娶媳婦的叫做等郎嫂），到了成人的時候，不幸因丈夫不良，或丈夫鄙棄她，而想離婚改嫁，眞是困難極了。當她舉行脱離手續的時候，誰也不能給她帮忙。迷信告訴他們，管了人家離婚的事情，會不吉利的，因此不單旁人不睬，連丈夫也不肯親手寫離婚書，只許得了丈夫的同意，叫一個乞丐代寫。然而寫離書的地方也會發生問題，如果住在近河的地方，便在河邊去寫，如果住在山鄉的地方，只得在墳墓旁邊去寫。等到結婚的那天，要跑到很偏僻的地方去梳頭和整裝。假使給附近村莊的人知道了，必定要遭　遷，受　駡的　迷信告訴他們，離婚婦女換裝的地方　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>（二）孀婦的再嫁，孀婦的再嫁，不單和有夫之婦的改嫁一樣的艱難，而且格外多迷信的手續。迷信説，孀婦已死的丈夫的靈魂是時常跟着她的，假使還了靈魂的意旨而再嫁，靈魂就要跑到她的新夫家裏去，使她的新夫也遭不吉的。所以嫁的前幾天，就要離開父母，天還没有亮或半夜裏，就要偷跑到尼姑庵裏去住，等到結婚的那一天，還要買一雙木屐，預備進門時候穿的，到了門口時就要換上木屐，不許穿鞋進門，這纔可以使她的已死的前夫認不出她的脚跡來。</p>
<p>有以上種種的迷信，所以把再嫁的婦女，比平常的婦要低一格看待，因此梅縣生活稍爲安定一點的男子，或在社會上有些地位的男子，絶對不娶再嫁的婦女。自然的結果，再嫁的婦女，必定要在不顧一切的窮漢隊裏，或被認爲低一格的男子羣裏去找她的配偶。否則惟有忍着痛苦終身不再改嫁。這種維持舊禮教的方法，實在毒辣，也不能不令人佩服牠的巧妙了。</p>
<p>有志打破舊禮教，從事婦女運動的人們，應該知道破除迷信也是一件不可忽視的工作。</p>
<h3>海頭姑娘</h3>
<p>— 鐵懷</p>
<p>在故鄉，在我那位於海之濱的故鄉，最使我忘不了的自然，是那莊嚴偉大的海景，與美麗絢爛的從海中冉冉而出的朝日；而尤其使我忘不了的，是那批充滿了自然美秉賦著剛强性格的「海頭姑娘」。</p>
<p>「海頭姑娘」，這在吾鄉差不多是人人懂得的一句鄉土話。意思是她們住近海濱，她們天天同弄潮兒一樣厠混在海水裏，她們是依海爲生。自然，他們也各有她們自己的家。</p>
<p>她們的生活，是每當海水漲時，她們去張網捕魚，（這工作還是男子做得多一點；這種男人，我們呌他做「海頭人」。）海水退時，她們去拾取土帙。此外她們更常在鹽沙上晒鹽，築鹽池，挑鹽滷，做著與男子同樣的工作。有田地的也會種田植菜，有空還得三五成羣的入城賣土蚨，賣菜，賣海貨，割洋草，挑薺菜。記得我在故鄉時每當早晨在睡眼朦朧中聽到那「賣白菜黄芽菜」高吭的聲時，常常會惕然以驚，不自覺的坐了起來。下午四五時，當太陽快要落山的時候，似乎是她們最閑散的時間，她們割得羊草滿筐，唱著山歌回去，頭上總是包著一塊原始的「拷花布」，髻挽得高高地，髻上總是扞著一只紅色的骨籤。</p>
<p>大約因爲她們生活在海濱的緣故，她們臉色黧黑，但她們都有著强大的力氣。誰若是欺負了她們，就無異在太歲頭上動土，老虎額上搔癢，准會受到她們的破口大駡，受到她們的一塲奚落，簡直非呌你陪罪不止。我們的故鄉人，誰都知道海頭姑娘是不好惹的。我覺得，她們的表裏，那充滿著自然美。我們女子，難得有那種剛强的習性的。</p>
<p>她們的山歌，自成一格，大率是在她們負草歸去時唱的，我曾聽明白過一首：「海鹽寶塔七層高，七層塔裏有把七星刀，七星刀上七個字：戳殺丈夫坐監牢」。我雖然不能查明那山歌是不是專指某一件事，但他們的反抗精神，於此可見。男性的讀者請放心！我决計不是要借海頭姑娘口中的山歌，來喚起每個女子的殺心，來危害她親愛的或失了和的丈夫。那不過是略舉一例，表示我們的海頭姑娘，會有那樣的大膽，那樣的魄力。我常自恨，我爲什麽不生長在海頭？我的性格，若得受了海的薰陶，至少總可以比現在剛强一點。</p>
<p>忘不了的海頭姑娘！忘不了的紅骨籤花包頭，忘不了的士軼白菜聲，更忘不了的大膽的山歌啊，祝你們與海俱在！今年的農村破産，可破産到你們頭上來？你們又將如何繼續與自然抗爭，與社會搏鬥啊？</p>

<h3>人類與自然</h3>
<p>— 劉微</p>
<p>一切事物都在矛盾中存在和發展，這是一個宇宙的根本大法。人類和自然的關係之演變，也是在它的支配下前進的。人類是自然的一部分，他自身就爲自然的物質所組成，爲自然物質所演變，進化，發展而來的。不但如此，在他的繼續生存中，一切衣，食，住的需要，仍須取給於自然，受自然的供養。所以人類是出於自然，自然是他的母親和撫育者，他不依靠自然就不能生存和發展。但是，人類不只是順應自然，他一樣在反叛自然，和自然鬭爭。他的勞働生産就在克服自然，使自然來適應自己的生存目的，利用自然來滿足自己的生活。所以蘭開斯得勳爵把自來的人類比之於自然家庭的逆子，説也常常違抗天命，天命命令他説『你一定得死』，他却抗聲道『不行，我一定要活』。的確，如果説人類要順應自然才能生存是對的，那麽我們説人類也要反抗自然和自然鬭爭才能生存，也是對的。人類的生存就在他和自然之又是恊調又是矛盾的關係上，建立起其基礎，並隨着這不斷的調恊和矛盾發展與進化下去。</p>
<p>這裏我只須舉一二事實來作一個例證，便可以明白。人類的手是從事勞働生産的主要工具，有了它人類才創造出自己的社會，文化，才創造出自己和動物根本有别的生活形態，創造出自己的獨特的歷史，獲得特殊的發展與進化。可是手這東西，首先就是自然界的人類這種動物的自然器官之一，就是説自然物之一。不但它的本質一樣是原子，化學分子，細胞等自然物質的集團，以種種原素組成的；而且不怕手怎樣靈巧活潑，能製造工具，能寫文章，能描畫藝術品，但它的活動中之關節的運動，是不能不依靠力學的槓桿運動等等，即不能不在自然的物理法則支配下行之。不但如此，人類的手是從動物的前足進化來的，而這前足之所以能進化爲人類的手，乃是人類先祖在樹棲生活中之樹上的自然環境，和其離開樹棲生活而到平原以後，再和動物乃至一般的自然鬭爭的自然環境誘導中形成起來，即從攀援，取果實，握物，取石子，製作工具等等誘導中形成起來的。一句話，人類的手出於自然，是自然不斷的把它創造出來的。但是，人類在這勞働過程中，也用他的手和自然鬭爭，反抗自然。比如他伸手去摘果實，這就是在和那生在他的嘴外高置於樹上的果實的空間距離的限制相鬭爭，他拾石子是和猛獸相鬭爭，他製造一切工具則是在和任何自然界中的困難環境相鬭爭。刀是拿來克服有硬度不能爲體力所分裂的東西，船是用來克服水的阻隔的東西的，要有這些鬭爭他才去運用他的前肢勞働，前肢才能變成手，變成能製工具的器官。再舉個例，人類的生存和進化都要靠社會，但社會是由人類這一自然物和他以外的自然物相接觸交換，才形成勞働生産過程，形成社會的；社會的存在和進化，也是要有自然因素和生産能能成功，這是社會爲自然之一部分並出於自然的所在。然而作爲社的存在本源之勞働生産，根本就是在利用自然和克服自然，所以社會又是和自然相鬭爭相矛盾的，而人就在這矛循對立中進化的發展並生活着。</p>
<p>不錯，人是偉大的，他不像一般的動物那樣，專聽自然的擺佈。人在和自然鬭爭中使自己進化，改變着自己的機體，生活，環境，可以説人的歷史是自已創造的，而一般的動物的歷史則單純地是自然創造的。但是，我們必須知道，人類之能够和自然鬭爭，强迫自然使之適應自己的目的，也不是他有甚麽特殊的超自然的權力，乃是利用自然自己的力量去制服自然，以自然自己的法則去驅使自然的結果。人類無論如何偉大，如果不依賴自然，不利用自然法則，也一樣不能奈何自然。很顯然的，人類不利用火力，便不能鍜鍊鐵，並把它製成鐵器；不利用刀，便不能劈物伐樹；不利用重力，便無法捶擊：不利用空氣的浮力，便無法製成飛機，發達航空。所謂科學，即是全部自然物性及其法則的研究與整理的知識，而人類利用科學以發達生産，戰勝自然，事實上就是以自然對付自然。所以人類的偉大，也只在於能操縱自然便之歸附自己，照自己的目的和需要去爲自己工作而已。這樣説來，人類對於自然，即在支配自然一點上也是有限的。這限制是一方面由於他縱能滅絶自然的個别物，但却不能滅絶自然力，不能廢除自然法則；他方面則人類的支配自然，是支配亦是屈服於自然，因爲他要被限制在服從自然法則的條件下，才能支配自然，是支配亦是屈服於如此，人類常常對自然奮鬭過去，自然亦常常給人類以反逆的報復，毁滅他的勝利。從前意大利人把南部山腰的森林伐盡，去不料那裏的畜牧事業會因此大受打擊，便是事實。雖然如此，可是自然的這種反逆作用，也正是使人類不斷地改進其對自然鬭爭的方式等等的原因，人類的進步亦埋伏在這裏了。</p>
<p>從上述的種種看來，人類和自然的關係，以及人類自己的生存與進步，都是在矛盾鬥爭中獲得的，絶對的馴服而不知和他的環境鬥爭，不但没有人類的進步，而且也没有生存的可能。如果人類的先祖開始就只是馴服於自然，完全聽他的環境捉弄，那麽根本就不能離開動物上進爲人類，没有人類存在於地球上。如果此後不能繼續地和自然相矛盾相鬥爭，那麽人類到知今恐怕還是原人，没有現今的進化。但是，人類的權力亦是有限的，他只能在自然之内有其存在，進化，鬥爭和反抗的能力，離開自然就無能爲，也没有人類了。那些以爲人是超自然的東西，以爲人類有其特殊的超自然的支配，改變和創造世界的神秘的力，是完全錯誤的。人類出於和自然相矛盾的宇宙法則中，鬥爭就是他的權威，是他進化與生存的根源。</p>

<h3>方法論的重要</h3>
<p>— 基仲</p>
<p>梁實秋教授説：「今人研究學問喜談方法，好像方法是一塊敲門磚，是一把鑰匙，一得到方法便可升堂入室似的。據我看，至少在文學研究上，方法固然要緊，最要緊的還是在功夫。功夫用到了家，縱然方汉笨些，也會有成績的，若是功夫不足，無論什麽方法也是無濟於事的。」（見「偏見集」一九○頁）然而在事實上，假如没有方法，功夫也就無從用起了：自來一切研究學問的人，用死功夫的人，都是在一定的方法下進行其研究的。教人終日理讀「子曰」，只講背誦，不求理解的老童　的教書法，雖然很笨拙，但也是一種方法，因而在其教育之下用死功夫的人，也是在這個笨的方法下去實行的。亞里士多德總可説是用功夫的人，但如他没有形式選輯的方法，那他的一切著作都没有辦法完成。因格爾士也是偉大的哲學家，但假如他没有動的邏輯，那也是絶對不能戰勝杜林，　　成其偉大的哲學　　的。所以我説，「方法是一塊敲門磚，是一把鑰匙」，没有牠，一切研究者便無從用功夫，更不會獲得什麽結果。黑格爾在其哲學中那麽地重視方法論，自來一切學理的論戰都以方法論爲中心，這都不是偶然的。</p>
<p>「方法是一把鑰匙」，但不一定每一把鑰匙都可打開鎖住各種學術的門户的鐵鎖，只有那與這鐵鎖相合的鑰匙才能打開各種學術的門户，才能「升堂入室」一如　　　的方法猶如一把與鎖　相適合的鑰匙，那麽，便只有用正確的方法去研究學術，才能獲得正確的結論；反之，在錯誤的方法外，不管怎樣用功夫，也是不能探得眞理的，這種情形，可説是與一把和鎖不合的鑰匙之不能打開門户一樣。我們知道，有些信佛教的和尚，終日都在念「阿彌陀佛」，用死功夫—但結果還是不能了解佛教的社會意義。白壁德的門徒們，雖然努力在研究「人事之律」，用死功夫，但終於是不能認清「人事」，解决「　　問題」，而不　不投奔於宗教之下，爲帝國主義者服務了。由此可見在錯誤的「笨的方法」下，縱然用了功夫，也是不會有什麽好的成績的。佐治説得好：「結論中的謬誤，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>難保没有，而在後來正確方法適用之際，必可糾正。但反之，謬誤的方法能給與我們以和某一種眞理之各部分都不矛盾的結果者，則是極稀罕的情形」。</p>
<p>研究方法和生産工具一樣。如果生産工具是製造生産品的，那麽，研究學術的方法便是獲得知識的工具；又，如果手工業的生産工具只能製造粗笨的生産品，一定要新的機械的生産工具才能製出很精緻的東西來，那麽，落後研究方法便只能獲得落後的知識，只有新的進步的研究的方法才能獲得新的進步的知識。所以，在我們探求新的進步的知識中，獲得新的進步的研究方法是比什麽要重要的。</p>
<p>向來我們所用的方法，乃是亞里士多德以來爲一般學者所採用的形式邏輯。這個形式邏輯有三個最高的定律，即：</p>
<p>一·甲是甲　　同一律</p>
<p>二·甲非非甲　矛盾律</p>
<p>三·非甲即乙　排中律</p>
<p>這就表面看來，似乎是與客觀事物相合的眞理，因而也是能探得客觀事物之究竟的方法。可是，人類知識發展到了現在，已經認識了客觀事物不是那麽簡單，死板的。由於産業的發展，自然科學上的一切發明，我們早已知道一切客觀事物都不是絶對地靜止着的，而是在矛盾中發展變化着的。牛頓的凡物靜者恒靜動者恒動的定理，早被愛因斯坦的相對論推翻了。因爲一切事物都在發展變化中，都是相對地存在着的，所以，一切客觀存在着的事物是這樣同時又是那樣，是甲同時又是非甲的。譬如一碗水吧，它正在不住地蒸發，變爲氣體，當你説這是一碗水時，它是已經有一部分變爲氣體了，而且還在繼續變化，不是原來的那碗水了：因之，你如説這碗水就是這碗水，不是别的東西，那便與事實不合，是錯誤。又如，一個人自也世以來，便是一天一天在生存下去，同時又是一天一天地在接近死亡，即一天一天地死下去的；如果從其正活着一點上説，則他是在一天一天地生存下去的，反之，倘若從其日益接近死亡一點上説，則他又是日益死亡下去的：所以我們可以説，一個人是正在生存着同時又是正在死亡着的。—此類之例，舉不勝舉。由於這些例證，由於這些客觀事物之實際情形的表明，我們當可知道形式邏輯是與客觀事物不相合的，因而也是不能探得客觀眞理的錯誤的研究方法。如果要探求客觀眞理，探求新的進步的知識，那便只能把舊日的形式邏輯的論理學教科書當作一種普通常識的教本，不應將其作爲惟一的研究學問，處理問題的方法；我們必須努力去獲得與客觀事件相合的新的進步的方法—動的邏輯。當着已經有了蒸汽的電力的耕具，你還要用鋤頭鐮刀來工作；同樣，當着已經有了進步的新的動的邏輯，你還要去用形式邏輯方法，那你不是自甘落伍的庸人，便是什麽都不知道的傻瓜！</p>
<p>那麽，所謂動的邏輯是什麽呢？這不是這樣的一篇短文章所能詳細答復的問題，讀者諸君請去閲讀因格爾士，佐治……等所著的一切偉大的著作吧。於此我只説：一切事物都在矛盾地發展變化中，都是相互關聯着的，所謂動的邏輯便是事物所具有的此種實際的情形之反映，便是在事物之矛盾地發展過程中，在其相互的關聯中去理解事物處理事物的。</p>
<p>不錯，我們必須用功夫，但我們必須要把握着新的進步的方法—動的羅輯去用功夫，不當在落後的方法下去幹徒勞無益的笨事。時代進展到了現在，一切事物的複雜性都顯示了出來，各種學術都有了長久的歷史與豐富的内容，如果我們不把握着與客觀事物之實際情形相合的這個新的進步的方法—動的邏輯去研究它們，縱然用了死功夫，那也是不能獲得眞理的。所以我説，在現代如果要探求眞理，獲得正確的知識，那用功夫自然很重要，但獲得新的進步的方法論—動的邏輯尤其重要。於此我勸一般苦學的青年首先去讀那些闡明這動的邏輯的書籍，去獲得這研究學問，處理問題的新方法—動的邏輯。</p>

<p>— 柳辛子</p>
<p>瓜子殻，烟霧，茶精，熱蒸着的人氣……</p>
<p>轟隆轟隆的滿是嘈雜的聲浪，大掛長袍，瓜皮帽，圍巾，西裝，油光的頭，刷子似的鬍子，北方大老，大腹商賈，也有年輕的大少。</p>
<p>嗑——剥，瓜子分成了兩片。</p>
<p>人的潮，中國式長大衣裏癰腫的人形，接着又是一個，圓口方鞋擺着八字步，從那進口的圓洞中踏步。</p>
<p>是人間的廣寒宫！</p>
<p>人把四處空隙都塞滿了，頭頂上的電炬，霓紅燈在閃耀，熱氣幾乎要把人窒息了，四壁掛滿了小孟君的色的勝利品，粗俗的大紅横幅：「珠喉宛轉」，「天生麗質」，「繞梁三日（？）」，這些性慾的頌詞！</p>
<p>僕役，穿的青色短褂，紅條子的鑲邊，在人堆中穿出閃進，熱開水的熱氣，熱手由的熱氣，白漫漫地，對面看不見人形。</p>
<p>幽靈似的人，仍不斷地三五，成羣的從洞，口進來，在走道上都擺滿了椅子。</p>
<p>——嗎的，他穿的是洋裝不是？那娘！老子不把錢的？</p>
<p>這大漢在四方桌上猛的拍一下，當的一聲，水潑在地下了，大漢的視綫，終於被西裝少年的臨時安插的坐椅遮住了。西裝少年若無其事地，一屁股坐了下來，只是那大漢還是圓睜着慾火的眼，怒視着那僕役。</p>
<p>台上的電光，閃的一亮，鑼鼓震着耳鼓。</p>
<p>談話的聲浪幾乎同此例的增高、精靈似的人都興奮着。</p>
<p>——霉是倒足了的。乙宿暗刻，自板捧出……</p>
<p>鑼鼓聲更加高抗，人們却坐得不耐煩了，欠着腰，嘘着口哨。</p>
<p>轟隆轟隆，滿是嘈雜的聲浪。瓜子壳，烟霧，茶精，熱蒸着的人氣，</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>「好！」雙轉灣的尖鋭的聲音，好像是世界的末日到了，一陣大的騷動。</p>
<p>綠色的幔裏輕盈地飛出了個紅色女人，背對着聽衆，烏雲蓋着的頭低俯着，粉白的長藕，撐持在半方桌上。</p>
<p>紅色女人的臉，倐地轉過來，亮的燈光照耀着，血紅的小口裏吐着咿咿啞啞的音調，這被宰割的慘呌！——瘦削的身體是斜側的，紅衣高領上支着一個石灰團成的臉龐，蕩漾的眼波，從這裏飛到那裏，從落腮鬍子飛到粉白臉蛋。妖蕩的媚笑過後，纖指又抓着波浪似的頭髮。</p>
<p>拉胡琴的死命拉着弦弓。台下面，每個人的頸項拉得和弦弓一樣長。</p>
<p>這些人多半是眼睛的享樂主義者！</p>
<p>就在全塲麻醉似的狂熱中，紅色女人像輕燕似的閃進幕中。</p>
<p>第二個女人出來的時候，台下面，又起了個不小的騷動。「唷——哈哈」</p>
<p>「呀——哈哈哈——」</p>
<p>這是一張徐娘的臉，雖然還存着她昔日以使人瘋狂的遺痕，然而没有一個人會注意到這個。她痛苦的微低着頭，唱着悲凉的歌調，聲調到高鋭的時候，滿腔鬱憤與聲淚俱下，可是，「噓——噓——」的聲音，起自人堆的四角。</p>
<p>這裏没有藝術，只有肉的誘惑。</p>
<p>人們在討厭的空氣中將那歌女送走之後，台口上天花板中的其他尚未扭開的電炬，一齊開放了。水晶宫一般的光亮！花籃，銀盾，成列的由僕役排在台口和半方桌上。這許多珍貴的禮物上都寫上俘虜的名字。</p>
<p>鑼鼓的聲音，和人羣奮發的情緒，都已超越了高潮，站上了尖端。花名牌上調換了「小孟君」三個字樣，「小孟君」，刺——的都射入色情狂者的眼中，呵！小孟君，色的主人，口哨像鞭砲似的從四野裏燃放。</p>
<p>眞的，小孟君已站在照耀如同白晝的台上，爲數百十隻貪慾的眼捕捉着了。她，挺時髦的衣架，挺迷人的媚眼，挺風騷的姿態，她是色情王國裏的統治者，是驕傲的王！</p>
<p>火紅的兩片小瓣兒剛展開，胡琴的音調，和她的聲音却並没有一致起來，不知是樂師的疏忽呢，還是她的錯誤？可是，羣衆都像没有把注意帶及到這一點，仍舊各自利用各自沸騰着的熱情，把眼珠子去鈎取那肉的各部分。</p>
<p>在平淡並不出奇的時候，會在各處散出各色各樣的怪呌。</p>
<p>大鬍子就迷細的眼。抹抹鬍子，輕點着頭。西裝青年的眼眶恨不能放得比眼鏡圈還大。</p>
<p>大鬍子把手向右角裏招了招，那老板，彎着背輕步走到大鬍子前面，謹慎地笑。點戲，大紅紙寫的牌子，掛起來啦，「毛先生點戲；秋胡戲妻！」小白臉蛋兒也摸了摸口袋，瞪着妬忌的眼，找了那老板。</p>
<p>「再來一個！」</p>
<p>「再來一個！」</p>
<p>無數口哨的滚動。</p>
<p>女王終於不見了。台前花名牌上，僕役正裝着另一個歌女的名牌兒。</p>
<p>旅行一週</p>
<h3>三峽印象記</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>三峽是揚子江流域最險峻的大山峽，據於湖北與四川接壤之地，爲大巴山脈横阻揚子江的焦點。所謂三峽係包括瞿塘峽，巫峽及西陵峽之總稱。此係中國大然險要的名勝。古時諸葛武侯的「八陣圖」，據説就是瞿塘峽西首下關側面的六十餘堆細石。難怪有很多的著述家，通常都指三峽爲川省門户。即以近數十年間而論，自滿清帝國崩潰以來，四川對中央政府的關係，即形成若即若離的政治局勢。這固然是中國政治經濟畸形發展的自然現象，但三峽之阻隔川省與外間的自然形勢，却不能説是毫無意義的。</p>
<p>記得李白有詩云：「朝辭白帝彩雲間，千里江陵一日還，兩岸猿聲啼不住，輕舟已過萬重山。」是的，這種舊詩的描寫，到現在仍是寫實的。假如旅行者蒞臨三峽的時候，也許要反覆地吟誦李白的詩句。據筆者親自往返經過三峽數次之多，覺得每次的旅程疲勞都在輪船行經三峽時，完全消釋在那種雄壯險峻的重山峭壁之間了。一個光臨過三峽的人，腦子裏的印象總是非常深刻而濃厚的。我覺得那種農厚的樣子，恰好像地圖上繪山脈重疊的記號似的。現在，就我所得到的實際印象，分述如次：</p>
<p>由湖北到四川，經過宜昌以西，不到三個鐘頭，輪船便進至西陵峽了。再往西進，約模半天的光景，便是屬於巫峽的範圍。十個鐘頭以後，瞿塘峽也就可以過完。在這裏，就是李白所謂「朝辭白帝彩雲間」的白帝城。數百里的山峽，接連不斷地綿延着。連峰夾岸，眞是萬仭矗天。兇惡可怕的怪石與玲瓏可愛的山景，完全包含在兩岸的峭壁上面。由江心的輪船上看到那些懸崖雜錯的起伏圖畫，令人探望不着沿江的大山路徑。只是，遠遠地隱約可見土人操作於崎嶇的山谷間。至於李白所謂「兩岸猿</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>聲啼不住」，我們在輪船上是没有領略到的。因爲三峽的兩岸雖比不上揚子江下游那樣寛廣；實際上，在三峽的江面上至少也難於聽到猿猴的呌聲。而且，輪船逆水而上，特别加大的馬力已使船身震動得很厲害。摩托發動的聲音，當然也是加倍的宏大。還有江水傾瀉的急流，冲盪着輪船的前進。如果没有經騐的旅客，到了那種緊張的航行，恐怕没有不心驚膽寒的。那種水聲與船聲的交響，好比怒吼的海潮一樣。在那種時候，人，似乎只覺得自然界偉大的作用是可以支配自己的命運了。</p>
<p>據長江上游的船員説：要經過三峽的輪船，她的鋼板必須比普通海輪的鋼板厚實；不然，船就有被江水冲破的危險。所以，在三峽往來的輪船，其質料可製軍艦。關於這層，我們覺得中國人與自然界鬥爭的力量，並不比外洋帝國主義　與海潮抗爭的力量小。這使我對於下面的事情，感到興奮；</p>
<p>在輪船通過三峽的時候，領江是如何地在緊張工作着！他們的年齡都是好幾十歲的。據説，他們完全是憑自己當年用木船航行的經騐，記憶着那沿江任何地帶的礁石與淺灘的地位或方向。長江上游的航行，完全憑他的寶貴經騐才能行駛輪船；可惜，他們没有科學的整理和研究。我們擔心這種純粹的土産國貨的權威或許不能持久。萬一那幾個老領江年老逝世了，除了他們所密傳給少數徒弟的之外，那時這種寶貴珍奇的技術，便不免要像古書一樣絶版。這一點事情，不知道現今提倡實業的人們是否在設法補救？</p>
<p>其次，是沿三峽的兩岸山石間，流露有很多石油的黑色礦液。在船上可以隨時看見那些石油流露的新舊痕跡。這顯然是大巴山脈的礦産豐富的表現。據一位地質學家説，在大巴山所藴藏的煤，鐵，石油之多，可稱爲内地的第一等礦産區域。我想，這種天然富源，不知在什麽時候方可開採呢？隨北而來的印象，便是一個旅行者到了這種自然寶藏的所在，不禁會聯想到這裏土人的社會生活。</p>
<p>記得有很多研究文化問題的人，都承認「人類克服自然界的程序，是社會生活的文化之標誌」。根據這個道理，三峽的自然環境之偉大力量，迄今仍是没有被那裏的人類征服；這就是那個地方的土著人民，仍然在過着極低落的文化生活的理由吧！</p>
<p>我們的輪船通過三峽的時候，雖然覺得有點冷清清的風味。可是，同時在沿江的邊際，時或仍是可以發現木船。它們並不一定是專航行於比較平靜的沱灣。許多的時候，江水急瀉得有如鍋中沸水，跳躍的浪花最怒吼的地方，它們仍然照常地航駛向前。逆水而行，很難看出它們的進展。雖然，在三峽一帶的商務，確仍是依賴着這種交通工具。在那裏的糧食，粗布，食鹽及各種日常生活必需品，完全是藉這種交通工具運輸接濟的。</p>
<p>在三峽的農民們，種植稻米的比較的少。因爲全係山地，例是以雜糧，如玉米，豆類等爲主要生産。鴉片也有相當的繁殖。此外，農民們也有靠礦産生活的。他們既不是開「礦廠的老板」，也不是「礦工」。在那裏根本没有這樣的名詞。他們只不過是從大自然的山崖上拾取一些煤塊，如同拾取石塊一樣，運往縣城或市鎮上去零售吧了。他們無需出成本，只憑自己的氣力，能擔負得多少重便拾取多少煤塊。所以，他們把煤塊運到市塲上出賣的時候，照例不大計較價錢，只求銷售脱手，換一點錢買生活品回家即心滿意足了。這是一位家住巫峽的朋友告訴我的。</p>

<p>「人獸齊觀」如果是在電影上出現這一影片的廣告名字，那它至多不過只是用來描寫一種影片内容，表明勇士，美人，巨獸混處一團，演出許多鬥争，恐怖，愛情的大觀，以引動觀衆的感情和贊賞崇拜而已，這裏並不能體現出甚麽社會關係來，所以除了它的藝術價值本身以外，是没有甚麽深刻的意思的。我們常在報章雜誌的拾零中，看見許多瑣細的新聞，不是某國某某富翁死時，立下遺囑將其財産劃出幾千幾萬留給他的愛犬，由他的愛犬承繼，便是某國某某狗明星馬明星，在其逝世以後遺留了若干財産，由牠的主人承繼。本來，在過去的人類史中，財産的所在者和承繼者，都只限於是人才有這個權利。財産的所有者是把財産遺傳給他的子女或朋友，也要是他的子女或愛友才能作爲他的財産承繼者。縱然有時可以將財産捐贈給慈善公益機關，但法律上爲了要符合惟有人始能享有和處理財産的緣故，所以對這些社會機關，也不能不給它們以假人的資格，稱它爲法人。於是財産的遺傳和承繼，縱然不完全是眞人，也須要是法人才有這權利。就是説財産的遺傳者和承繼者，總歸要是俱有人的資格的人才行，這是意味着財産和個人的人格是緊相結合着不能分離的。可是現在不然了，社會的進化進化到了個人的財産與個人直接管理和處分没有必要的時代，財産不但可以—而且是必需—離開自己的蓄藏倉庫，離開自己的身手，讓它獨立地在社會上去活動，流通，盡它自己的作用，而且一般的也進展到不要自己直接管理，經營，處分財産的社會時代，只能把它交給代理人去經管處分，别人也只要是在財産主權所屬的條件下，可以代你管理，經營，處分一切，財産和個人的肉體乃至人格，都可以不必發生密切的直接關係。不管是甚麽樣的主體，只要有人代爲經管，處理，這財産依然可以在社會上盡它的作用，在社會上活動，流通，生息。所以法律上儘可以不問主體的品格，只規定一個主權就够了。因爲並不需要這主體是有直接處理的能力，這主體没有這能力亦可以不妨害這財産的社會作用之完滿的發生。這種情形，是爲近代的股分公司出現所明白表現了的。很顯然的，如果是一個舊的封建地主或貴族，他的銀子不是藏在他自己的身邊，便是要他直接去放債收息，就是説他要直接去管理，處分。可是現在有股分公司的新法子，你只要買得一張股票，那麽那公司的營業等等，都是請人去經管，財産的如何分配，行使，不須你去過問，自然有人代理你做一切你所能够和願意做的，你只拿着股票坐收紅利便可以了。在外觀上，這種情形是呌你的財産不認識你這主人，也不許你去隨便動它支配它，它自己怎樣在公司裏或社會上活動，也不要你去過問。這不是財産離開個人的肉體和人格而獨立地活動是甚麽？</p>
<p>因爲這樣，所以在財産所有者的主體失掉了自己管理和處分的必要與可能情形下，財産的主體是人是獸都没有關係，只要有一個代理他行使財産權的人就够了。所以這狗有財産，其財産可以由人承繼，人有財産，其財産可以由狗承繼，正是體現着現社會的財産關係之變化，體現着財産離開個人的人格性而獨立活動，體現着非財産的所有者可以處理别人的財産，個人的財産可以交給與財産所有權無關的任何人去管理等等社會關係。</p>

<h3>「取水」</h3>
<p>— 武房玉</p>
<p>陝西邠縣通訉</p>
<p>陝西這個地方，在没有到過的人總不免對牠有一種幻想，以爲是春秋時代的秦國的首都，當然有着不少的歷史上的遺跡，可供人們的憑弔與追懷。的確的，這裏是有着不少的歷史遺物，可是，也有着没有脱掉歷史性的初世紀式的遺民啊！在這裏的人民的思想，還是没有離開神權時代；他們的主宰者，不是華嶽山就是太白山，一切的疑難禍福都是在這兩座山上决定他們最後的運命。</p>
<p>陝西的山峰，在國内各省，恐怕除了四川省而外，是再没有别省可以和牠比擬的了；可是，河流却是少到使人不敢相信，雨水同陝西好像有了世仇似的，一年中也不肯到這裏來上三回。這裏的人民，看見了水比見了金子還寶貴，他們平常是不肯無條件的糟蹋一滴水；水就是他們的第二生命，常時爲了水就是再大的犧牲也是無所顧慮的。</p>
<p>最近西安渭水一帶，雖然新開了幾條河渠，溝通了水的來路，沿渠一帶的水田可不至再現亢旱的恐慌；但是距渠稍遠的地方，却仍是無法相水入田。因此，當夏秋兩季，雨水仍是像金鑛似的不容易發現；一般鄉民在無可奈何時，便不得不祈求他們的主宰——菩薩。這就所謂「求雨」。</p>
<p>求雨在這裏又呌「取水」，他們對這「取水」的儀式是非常隆重的；在事先由各村公推出一個平素品行端正的人做「會長」，另外推出幾個辦事幹練的人材佐理一切。第一次祭神，是在就地的廟内，擺起一張長大的香案，上面供着許多祀神的祭品；香燭插滿了香爐，香烟繚繞的充滿了全個殿堂。一切上供的東西擺好了以後，這才由「會長」主祭，望着菩薩必恭必敬的行着三跪九叩首的大禮；「會長」行過了禮退在一邊，最後是各姓會衆魚貫的跪拜磕頭，這時殿堂裏充滿了靜穆的空氣，好像在冰窖裏似的沉寂，連吐氣的聲音也嫌牠大了。這一塲祭典舉行過後，人們彷彿從水裏衝起來似的，聲浪一會兒高到連對面説話的聲音也無法聽得清楚；接着就是鑼鼓喧天，乒咚兵咚的日夜敲着，就是幾里路以外都能够意想到這邊熱閙的情形。</p>
<p>「祭神」完了，接着就是「設壇」；這「設壇」的形式却更加嚴肅了。在這天參加的會衆，都一律要「齋戒」才准進去。在廟門口放有「神棍」兩根交叉的擺着；「神棍」兩頭是漆的黑色，中間是紅色，彷彿像軍隊裏用的軍棍似的，但牠的權威比起軍棍來却祇有過之而無不及。一般看熱閙的人，一見了這種「神棍」本能的就會裹足不前；對於婦女那更是禁止的厲害，就是在廟以外附近的路上行走也絶對不准通過。設了壇第二天，便在赴會的人衆裏面，選出三個平素道德崇高的人代表上山，（這山就是華嶽山或太白山）開始「取水」了。</p>
<p>這三個被選上山「取水」的人，每個人頭上都戴上一個柳條編成的圈，一個人背着「柳筐」的筐裏放了一隻磁瓶；一個人背着乾糧，預備在　路上餓了可以把牠充飢；還有一個人提着一面小鑼，一面走，一面敲着。在這來往數十里的長途上，這三個人是絶對不能休息的；到了晚上，他們還是要找着一處廟宇，就在露天裏燃起一柱香來，由三個人中的一個靜靜的當天跪着，直到那柱香快燒完了，才由另外一個人接着同樣的燒香跪拜。像這樣輪流的拜着，直到鷄呌了，才祇停止，但馬上又要起程上道；這樣，總要經過十幾天的餐風宿露，才能達到「取水」的目的地。到的這天，雖然是精疲力盡，但他們的一顆心却還是和來的時候一樣的虔誠。他們忘記了路上的辛苦，精神的虚糜；他們所希望的是比黄金還貴的雨點。</p>
<p>到了山上後，接着就往各廟燒香還願；不管這山上有多少廟宇，都不能遺漏一處的。他們那個柳筐裏的磁瓶，就在各廟的香燒了以後，把水盛得滿滿的一瓶，瓶口貼上一張紅紙封條，供在神像的前面；這上山「取水」的功夫，到這裏才算告了一個段落，他們在這天晚上才祇有一次片時的休息。第二天一早起來，再在神像前燒一次香，然後背上水瓶下山；每天晚上仍舊像來時一樣的跪拜，直到離「設壇」的地方十里或二十里的路程，纔在路上找一處廟宇停歇下來，由三個「水老」—「取水」以後的名稱—中的一人，預先兼程回去報告「會長」，然後又回到停歇的廟宇裏來，這就叫做「報水」。</p>
<p>「會長」得到了「取水」回壇的信，他那時喜悦的情形，彷彿就是一塲大雨跟着就要下來的一樣，馬上便傳齊各村的會衆凖備迎水。這迎水的儀仗，簡直和遜清時代的欽差大臣所用的没有兩樣。當啟行就道時，一切都顯得秩序井然。最前面是由許多青年會衆掮着「神棍」開路；精神抖擻的朝前走着，希望鋪滿了在每個人的臉上。後面接着的便是旗幟大隊，數丈高的彩色斗子旗桿，由三個身體健壯的會衆扛着，好像以前行軍的大纛旗般的高高而立在空中；一般的鄉民婦女，遠遠地見了這根旗桿，便像搶火般地把預備好的香案搬了出來候着。旗子過去，跟着是鑼鼓大隊，神閣子；這神閣子是由四個肖龍的「童男」抬着，走起來的步伐像鴨子似的一步一步的緩緩朝前進展。「神閣子」前面還有四匹黄馬，馬鞍上都繫上黄色的紙條，十足的顯示出神權的色彩。一般年老的鄉紳，一個個的手上捧着一個木船，一手拈燃起一根香，臉上都掛着肅穆的神情，魚貫的跟在「神閣子」後面走着。四五千的會衆，浩浩蕩蕩的朝着希望的路上進展，每個人臉上都有一種説不出的喜悦，但没有人敢輕易的張開嘴笑一下。</p>
<p>這種遠征軍似的「接水」大隊，琬蜒十數里的長行，在一條路上走着，的確是顯着十分的雄壯。他們用着蛙形步子走着，這樣，一直要走到一二十里外的放水的廟宇，才停歇下來；然後就由「會長」率領全體會衆，對「水瓶」行了叩拜大禮，才把水瓶安置在「神閣子」裏面循着舊路抬回。沿途的農村住户，等水經過時，都一齊燃上香燭跪拜起來。</p>
<p>水請到的七天之内，每天仍由「會長」和「水老」輪流的燒香禱告。在水到的第三天，各村會衆都齊集壇前燒香祀神，另外還要帶上百多斤麵粉作爲慰勞「水老」的禮品；這呌做「降香」。</p>
<p>設壇的期間大多數是規定七天。在第七天裏又由「水老」把水瓶安放在「神閣子」裏，們他在後面敲着鑼鼓擁着；從「設壇」的地方出發，游行各村一周，即回廟取消壇塲，這呌「游水」。</p>
<p>在這設壇期間。如果眞的下了一塲大雨，那鄉民狂歡的情形自不必説，就是這三個「水老」的名字也將永傳不朽了。</p>

<h3>靈肉一元論</h3>
<p>— 陸孝先</p>
<p>人爲感情的動物，也即以此爲異於一般生物的象徵。「愛」爲天賦與人類的本能，從一個嬰孩呱呱墜地，就帶着他的「愛」以俱來。人類社會中雖有惡與醜的一面，但决不可因此就抹殺了「人間的至美」——愛——的另一面。</p>
<p>一個享受着「愛情」的人，自身的生命就覺得異常充實，生活十分有意義，視個體以外的一切，也似乎都活耀着生命的熱力；雄偉嵯峨的山嶺，奔騰澎湃的流水，閃爍的星光，綺麗的雲霞，鳥鳴，花香，無不在愛流中摇蕩，世界上只有光明，只有美麗。反之，不幸的人，爲了失了愛的温暖，必將陷入悲哀而痛苦的深淵中　　　，人生樂趣，索然無味，人世間只有憎惡的對象，——這眞如没有陽光照射的衰草，没有靈魂的行屍。</p>
<p>雖然，戀愛不是整個的　生，戀愛至上更没有　分的理由，但若以戀愛爲冒凟人生，爲人生之大敵，那却是那般禁慾主義者的説教。牠，没有心理的生理的眞實的根據。張君勵説：『然我以爲一人與其自身以外相接觸，不論共所接觸者爲物爲人，要之，不免有佔有衝動存乎其間，此之謂私，既已言私，則其非爲高尚神聖可知。故孟子以男女與飲食並列，誠得其當也。……』這話我却不敢贊同。</p>
<p>男女間的性關係，是自然的，我不但覺得戀愛是自然的，而且我還主張戀愛的靈肉一元論。</p>
<p>戀愛之爲物，是産生於人類本能的愛欲之擴展，兩性的愛之衝動，其始因實不能離生殖的衝動而存在。推開天窗説亮話：戀愛者，慾的昇華作用也。戀愛的終極，亦不能離兩性生活的目的。</p>
<p>愛的範圍，本有種種：父母之愛，兒女之愛，兩性之愛，友朋之愛，愛自然，愛生物，愛人類，愛正義，愛國，愛美……，然兩性之愛，所以不同於其他方式的愛者，就在於後者的兩造必須是男和女的異性。</p>
<p>相傳林和靖伴梅妻鶴子，過了一生，但林和靖一定是個心理的變態者。又如近來有不少青年間盛行同性的戀愛：兩個男性，其中之一，把略呈女性化（無論在性格上肉體上）的另一個，幻作異性，互相熱戀，或兩個女性，其中略呈男性之一，自比男性，去熱烈的戀着另一個。但這種所謂同性愛，終是一個變態的行爲，决不是常軌，這只近乎一種幻覺，或一時的麻醉，有如孩子眼中的洋皂泡，一旦破裂，將受到極嚴重的幻滅的悲哀。前年西子湖濱兩雌格鬭的慘劇：陶思瑾之所以必殺劉夢瑩，從她們日記中詳細分析，原來她們是一對戀態的同性愛者。起始時相互感情的熱烈，實無異於兩性間，且曾本約不嫁以終老，但終於各猜忌對方已另有戀人，而互相妬忌，由愛而恨，而竟持刀相向，這種事態的演出，就因爲戀愛靈肉的不調和。</p>
<p>由上述的理解中，我們可以證明變愛之靈肉的不可分性。因此，我們對於一切不合理的婚姻，無論是舊式婚姻或是年齡懸殊的男女之婚姻始終認爲有乖戀愛的自然性。</p>

<h3>愛因斯坦傳（五）</h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>愛因斯坦從一九○九年冬季起，作爲基里契大學的副教授而開講了。他卒業後的兩年是浪人，其後七年則是伯倫的一個小官吏，現在則是瑞士第一大學的教授了，這當然在他的值得慶幸的。然而，作爲副教授的他，此時的實際的收入，與在伯倫時代的還是差不多。不僅如此，就是位置也並没高起來，所以就是移到基里契之後，其生活樣式也與在伯倫時代的相同，没有什麽變更。不過於此他的第二個兒子愛德維爾德降生了。</p>
<p>在開講之先，一九○九年九月，德意志理，醫者大會在扎爾滋布爾克開會了，愛因斯坦也被招出席。這乃是他與德國的許多學者相會的第一次。他的講演題目爲「關於輻射的本質與構造的觀念之發達」。他的關於輻射的理論，則是：從力學的機械的光以太的假説，到馬克思威爾的電磁光論，更産生了羅倫兹的電子論；而羅倫兹的電了論與相對原則並不是相矛盾的，依此則存在於其理論的根抵中的絶對靜止的以太，在實際上便不存在；一方面，依據勃蘭克的輻射論，因爲輻射的散發與吸收是不連續的，故以輻射爲以太的波動，於是他以爲在以太也没有的眞空中，這乃是成爲不連續的，粒子的存在而傳播着；他述説了所謂光量子之説。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦在基里契大學，除了編講義的義務之外，還有教室的事務，但物質的收入却與伯倫的差不多，當然不能令人稱意。正在這時，布拉加的大學請他去當正教授，於是他遂應招而離基里契了。一九一一年冬季他便偕其夫人及二子移居於普拉克。以後，他曾與凖馬費爾生的助手頓拜（今萊布基茨太學教授）來往。</p>
<p>布拉加或布拉哈，是現在捷克斯洛伐克共和國的首都，是往時奧匈帝國的一個都市。其大學，是一三四八年，德意志皇帝波埃廟國王加爾四世建立的，是德國最古的大學，但後來此地居民的大部分捷克人，有很多知識分子，因而與有勢力的德國人不斷衝突；在一八七九年與一八八○年，物理學者，哲學者愛倫斯特，馬哈爲大學總長，反對以德國人的教授來代替捷克人，以致大起爭論，於是，在一八八二年，這裏的大學即分開成爲捷克系的德意志系。</p>
<p>聘請愛因斯坦的，當然是分離了以後的德意志系的布拉加大學。這個大學雖較基里契大學小些，但對於愛氏倒頗有興味，他常個人地與學生親近，與同事實騐物理學主任教授蘭帕也很好，生活很有樂趣。可是，他在布拉加住了一年多後，又回到基里契來了。但這回不是在基里契大學，而是作他的母校勃里特尼克姆的正教授。</p>
<p>對於這個職務，巴黎的潘加勒與居里夫人的推薦是很有力的。一九一○年的秋天，潘加勒應了柏林的名呌烏拉尼亞的通俗科學講演塲之請，在「新力學」的標題之下講演了。他説，現在，在牛頓以來的力學上發生了大革命；他述説了愛因斯坦的相對論，即今日所謂的特殊相對論。由於這個講演，人們才開始知道了愛因斯坦的大名。十年以後，在愛氏更有名的時候，著他的傳記，對話錄的莫斯可夫斯基寫着；到現在爲止，愛氏之名因爲尚未在通俗講演等上表現出來，所以除專門家以外，是無人知道的。潘加勒在此是五十七歲，於二年後的一九一二年即去世了，他還没有相擊一九一三年以後愛氏之偉大發見，但他却看出了愛氏的才能，連同居里夫人的名字爲他寫推薦書送到基里契去。其中説：「愛因斯坦君是最有創造才能的人，我是到現在才知道他的。他還年輕，但他已經是現代第一流的學者；而且在第一流的學者中更是佔着優越的地位的。特别令人驚異的，是在於他能站在新的概念上，很容易地引出一切結論。他對於物理的問題，並不因於何舊來的原則；他看透思考的可能範圍的一切，頃刻間這便在他的心中構成新現象的預察，他日更加以實證。將來他的眞價值會日益發揮吧，得到他的大學，確會在與這個青年學者的關係上得到聲名吧。」</p>
<p>回到基里契的前年，一九一一年，愛因斯坦在布拉加深入了最有名的偉大研究的端緒。即是在六月間，他完成了那名爲「關於對光的傳播的重力的影響」的論文。前面已經説過，他在一九○七年的「放射學及電子學年報」上，在記載現在所謂特殊相對論的總合報告的那個東西的末章中，在等加速度的體系上擴張相對原理，述説了這是自然導入於萬有引力論的事情。四年之後，他又起草了這篇論文。</p>
<p>在此論文中，依據相等的原理，即依據一樣的重力的塲合與等加速度的塲合之相等，而記述了關於把一換置於他的事情，能力的惰性，即其重量的事情，在重力的塲合的時間的變化，即振動數的變化，以及在重力的塲合的光速度的變化，與隨之而起的光線的曲折。凡在四年前的上述的年報中提出的問題，於這篇論文中都實際地論述了。</p>
<p>這篇論文記載着切綫地通過太陽的光綫之曲折，即所謂愛因斯坦效果·是○·八三秒，但一九一六年，在最嚴密的理論之下，證明了這恰是其二倍的一·七秒。而且，在有名的一九一九年南美等院的日蝕觀測中，由英國的但孫，愛丁頓等證明了它的正確。自此以後愛因斯坦的相對性原理之名便在世界上喧囂起來了。（未完）</p>

<p>生逢亂世又年荒。五穀艱難貴米糧。兵荒馬亂烽烟盛。廬舍爲墟荆棘芒。後村破屋前村草。四野荒荒實斷腸。可是那農村空喊摇旗呐。依然是不見金錢救濟將。民心已苦生機絶。奔向都城找事忙。誰知都市人爲滿。一個個走頭無路路茫茫。詎意農民尚不覺。終朝終夜頸仲長。其意皆爲求飯吃。誰知吃飯更難當。但只見粥少僧多嘵口舌。安排位置費思量。八行書暗裏先推荐。到底人情讓大亨。招考不過遮耳目。明知物議要提防。能向都城求飯碗。勸諸君耕田依舊返家鄉。須知道都市最難衣食住。告求無路要慌張。所以不如歸去也。依然困守舊門牆。免得統離居客地。如何回去見爺娘。所以是奉勸農夫須吃苦。莫朝都市去彷徨。須曉如今難吃飯。還憑本藝去求詳。倒可以守得時來運也昌。</p>

<h3>諾貝爾文學奬金得者皮藍德婁將有好萊塢之行</h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>意大利戲曲家兼小説家藍德婁·自從獲得一九三四年諾貝爾文學奬金之後，那些善於迎合一般觀衆心理的美國出片家，早已有人揣測他們一定會去拉攏皮藍德婁，將他的作品搬上銀幕的。現在，果然不出所料，這位全世界聞名的戲曲家，本月内就要快到好萊塢來了。</p>
<p>這位作家的作品，在中國也有過相當的介紹。他是一八九七年生於意國西西里島，曾任羅馬城女子高等師範學校的教授，同時從事文學創作。他的小説，詩，和劇本，數目很多，在他本國是一個風頭很健的作家。</p>
<p>皮藍德婁認爲人生根本是苦海，是虚無。所以皮藍德婁著作裏，都充滿着悲觀厭世的色彩。諾貝爾文學奬金委員會在每年一次托個奬金的受者的時候，宗旨是把這奬金贈給最好的理想主義的作家。所以自來的暴露現實的自然主義以及舊寫實主義的作家幾乎没有一人得過奬的。但在今日要找健全的積極的理想主義的作家似乎頗不容易，所以這回的奬品只好給了悲觀懷疑的皮藍德婁。</p>
<p>當去年十二月間皮藍德婁赴瑞典京城司都克賀姆領受那位炸藥大王諾貝爾遺産九百萬的奬金時候，好萊塢幾家影片公司已派專員去和他接洽電影劇本的事。皮藍德婁始終對於銀幕工作都不大注意，這次因美國出片家來意很摯，除了指派代表接洽外，每天由海電或長途海底電話去催請他，使他祗好答認，暫將一兩種地的作品作爲銀幕嘗試，如果成功，他或者把全部個人作品都改編了做電影材料，或者索性自編一本純粹的電影劇本未定。</p>
<p>皮藍德婁有一個也稱爲「精神」兒子的人，那就是他現在專責營業方面管理的人。這位兒子曾得巴黎大學博士學位，以著作一本關於皮藍德婁的書，所以那位戲曲家認他是一個最親信的人。現在和影片公司接洽的人都由這位兒子代表皮藍德婁，若議有成，他派兒子先到好萊塢做籌備手續，徵求及探詢對方是否能實現他的計劃，然後皮藍德婁才起程來美。</p>
<p>照皮藍德婁的意思，他理想中作品第一部先搬上銀幕的就是他生平最得意傑作「六個找着著作人的演員」，若果好萊塢允許他的話，他願担任扮演劇中著作人脚色，因爲他説他扮着作人同時也是劇的著作人所以惟有他才知道六個演員爲什麽要去找着他呢。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「第一次世界大戰」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　First　World　War</p>
<p>——大光明——</p>
<p>在第一次大戰二十年後的今日，第二次大戰又在一個即發的情形之中，正義感的美國電影作家們，由於第一次大戰殘酷的教訓，不能不在這戰爭的前夜表示他們的憂悒，於是産生了「氣壯山河」（The　World　Moves　On），産生了「今古奇觀」，也産生了這「第一次世界大戰」。</p>
<p>很可喜的，「第一次世界大戰」是由於新聞片剪接的而成的。當我們現在回憶大戰當時情形的時候，這正好作爲我們温讀課本。在這裏編輯者勞倫斯脱林（Laurenge　Stallings）非常嚴肅的將舊的新聞片Montage編接起來，用着傷感的聲調解釋當時的情景。這裏没有一切庸俗影片中的戀愛糾紛，這裏祇是正面的告訴我們一些值得温習一番的史實。但是我們對於這一影片必須指出的；勞倫斯脱林對於第一次大戰没有本質的説明，他和一般人道主義的電影作家一樣，祇是因着大戰非人道的殘酷而引起了反感，厭惡戰爭的喊出反戰的呼聲。而且和「今古奇觀」的作者愛德文卡維（Edvin　Careve）一樣，認爲戰爭的發動，完全是少數窮兵讀武的武夫們的罪過，於是在這裏他從德國俾斯麥鐵血宰相冩起，出現了興登堡，福煦等將軍以及英皇喬其俄皇尼古拉等等。他們好戰，他們以戰爭爲兒戲，於是塞爾維亞的奧儲皇被殺之後，空前的大屠殺便開始了。更在第十章中寫法，福煦將軍指揮戰事之後，大戰更加激烈，衝鋒，大砲的轟擊，死亡枕藉，而英皇之流，却在不斷的以鐵十字勛章賜贈他們的士兵，驅逐更多的士兵到戰塲上去充當砲灰；戰爭的結果，乃是一片十字架的墓地。是的，他是厭惡戰爭的，當每一隻軍艦被擊沉海底的時候，他幾乎是用着吳聲在解説着的。特别是在大戰終結之後，經過一度短時間的和平，他大聲疾呼的説：「現在，請看今日罷！……」各國又在擴充軍備與凖備第二次大戰了，……」這濃重的傷感，其愛悒遺留在我們退出戲院之後的回憶之中。</p>
<p>但是我們却不能不加以適當的解釋；我們必須説明第一次大戰的發生，其本質的决不僅是將軍們的好戰，而是資本主義發展到最高階段，爲了侵略殖民地，爲了分割世界市塲，帝國主義戰爭的眞正的指使者，乃是資本主義的支持者。第一次大戰是如此發生了的，市塲分割之後便有所謂和平。可是一九二八年而後，開始了世界經濟恐慌。這恐慌潮浪，侵入了資本主義世界每一個角落，於是我們在西方，最顯著的聽到了希特勒政府的外交大臣喊出了進攻蘇聯的口號，而在東方最顯著的看到日帝國主義早已開始了侵略戰爭，佔據了東北。是的，和平即是帝國主義戰爭，佔據了東方。是的，和平即是帝國主義戰爭的凖備，在西方，一切和平的假面，都已揭穿，軍備的强化，法西斯蒂的跂扈，特别是義大利攻菲的軍事行動，一切瘋狂的狀態，無一不是大戰到臨的前夜。正如這一影片在最後一部分所展開的一樣，各國政治或軍事領袖，都在作發動戰爭煽動的演説，甚至於羅馬教皇也成爲鼓吹戰爭最積極的人物了。</p>
<p>那末，在道情形之下，人們將怎樣來應付這一苦難呢？即是説全世界將爲這更科學，更殘酷的第二次大戰所毁滅的大衆，特别是處於東方戰塲的我們，將怎樣來反對，而消弭戰爭呢？這使我們不能不想起「抵抗」中所給與我們的啓示，祇有以帝國主義戰爭變爲革命民族戰爭，方能保障永遠和平。同樣，在這一影片中，作者也没有忘懷俄國革命史實，他告訴我們，在一九一七年戰爭的積極進行之中，以出現在銀幕上的列甯與托羅茨基爲領袖的革命，是在十月之後建立了政權，立刻便和德國媾和了的。</p>
<p>但是勞倫斯脱林，在作品中到底包含了不少缺點，他一方面固然忽略了日本帝國主義在東方的猖獗，東亞大陸主義的叫喊，他是没有聽見的。同樣，他也表示了主觀的矛盾：他不會遺忘世界六分之一的社會主義國家之建立，可是他對於不侵略條約之廣泛的締結，却不加理會。於是和「氣壯山河」一樣，將爲了人類生活之向上加强防衛的武裝之鞏固，和帝國主義之擴充軍備同一估價，於是斯太林和莫索里尼或希特勒之流同樣的，作爲戰爭的煽動者而出現於銀幕了。</p>
<p>如上所述，這一作品並没有深切的接觸大戰的因果和本質。但是在目前，即使是人道主義的反戰影片，在美國能够不斷　出現，依然使我們覺得欣慰，因而對於這一影片，依然十分重視的。至於在技術上，作者將陳舊的新聞片，能修飾到如此清晰，以及在剪接上有着很大的成就，的確不是容易做到的。關心第二次大戰的觀衆們，我謹將這一影片介紹給你們。</p>
<h3>評「處女的日記」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>“Biographo　of　a　Bachelor　girl”—南京映</p>
<p>女畫師瑪琳因爲給許多名人之流作畫象，以致被人們疑惑她有什麽過人的媚力。於是青年作家寇德就多方慫恿她把生平的羅曼史在他的週刊上發表。</p>
<p>政治家諾侖在未婚妻絲蘭手中看到那週刊上的記載後，急得什麽似的，深怕自己和瑪琳間的戀愛史公開了出來，有礙他前途的政治活動，於是，他在哀懇作者筆下留情的計劃失敗之後，就請求大發行家，也就是他伯未婚丈人金某設計威脅。</p>
<p>這時寇德和瑪琳正休養在鄉間，在卿卿我我的愛之生活中著作這部待發表的「處女的日記」，諾侖和金某等都趕來了。在交涉的過程中，金某也有些愛慕她起來，諾侖更在未婚妻監視稍鬆中又大求其婚，弄得男女糾紛地使我們這劇作者也不能好好地處理了。</p>
<p>在瑪琳應了另一舊情人音樂之請，將往好萊塢的當兒，寇德海悮地燒了那部日記原稿，和她又熱戀起來。</p>
<p>這麽平庸陳舊的一套故事，按照常理是該聯得通順一點的。可是這兒劇作者拖泥帶水地弄得一無是處。如開始全没有必要地把劇情硬展開在從歐洲到紐約的輪船上，來一段海關禁止入口的擾攘。中間如未婚夫婦，老丈人，情婦，情婦的新情人大會面這一段，該是有戲可做的，却是零亂，平准地混了過去，而多餘地，等拙地没置另一音樂家者求婚被拒於前，突然招請於後。由於性格描寫的不够，把所請女畫師這一多情人的主角塗得不成其爲畫家與多情種子。至於硬派青年作家寇德是個社會主義者，而又叫他那麽無聊地做那愛替女人編情史，以及伴着情婦在溪流樹蔭下吸烟這些勾當。</p>
<p>道演Edward　H.　Griffith也許是感覺到這樣的劇情的無聊了，於是儘量地用所謂輕鬆的調子，和流俗的笑料的演出。於是先從Ca　ting上，有着惡形怪狀，使人發笑的政治家，心寛體胖得如大腹賈的音樂家。在對話中，在表情上，處處無原則地使用着所謂幽默，滑稽。可是這終不能掩蓋了内容的空虚與無聊。</p>
<p>演出上倒還是瑪琳在撲素的鄉間，圍着火爐，要寇德訴述他的身世，他痛心疾首地説他父親是礦，某次罷工中遭了慘殺，以及他對社會的認識，這一塲戲却收了相當的效果。可是在這全片的調子中是如何不恊韻啊！倘若作者强調在這方面的描寫，從平庸的男女羅曼史申滲透些悲壯的味兒，那末感人人豈不更深些嗎演員Ann　Harding與Robert　Montgomery因受了劇中人瑪琳與寇德的没有性格的限制，演技上没有什麽成就，倒是演政治家的Edward　E.　Horton成功了些反派的味兒。</p>

<h3>民族呼聲（Bordertowm）（九）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>黛兒没有法子，祗好答應了。他們坐在强尼的車子裏。绳经慢慢地開着。他越開越慢了。機來他們在荒野之中走了很久，强尼忽然將車停了下來。他説：「我要告訴你幾句話。我已經不能再忍耐了」。黛兒事前已經覺察到强尼有些什麽用意。她起初是不願意加以考慮。現在却不得不考慮了，因爲强尼已開始訴説他的愛了。他的態度並且很熱烈，這是黛兒初料所不及的。强尼道：「黛兒，我愛你。那天我第一次在法庭中遇見你的時候，我没有權力可以講這種話—我是一個窮鬼，处不了什麽的。但是現在，我已經有錢了，闊了，並且還有賺錢的計劃。我已經是一個有地位的人了。但是，我一切的工作辛苦，爲的是什麽？不是就爲了要和你講這句話嗎」？</p>
<p>怎樣回答他的話，怎樣解釋給他聽，她所以不能嫁他的理由？但又要使他不至於傷心，因爲他實在是個很可愛的人。不過爲了他是…她决定將這件事，輕描淡寫的處置。於是她説道：「你近來很羅曼諦克，但是有些過份了。至於婚姻更談不到，我們提都不應該提到」。强尼奇怪道，「爲什麽」？他的愚笨，在這個地方，使她着惱了。再則，她要到宴會上去，而時間已經很晚，更使她著急了。她於是憤然説道：「爲什麽？就因爲你不是我的族類。你是一個野蠻」。</p>
<p>强尼漸漸了解。憤恨漸漸膨漲起來。他喊道：「不是你的族類，嘿…你以爲…」他的態度使她更憤怒起來她從來没有受過男子這樣的對待。她想更講明白一些。她説：「我以爲，世界上還有平等兩個字。現在請你不要再使我生氣吧」。强尼聽了，不覺怒不可遏。他用力抓住了黛兒的肩膀，將她的身體旋了過來對着他，然後喊着道：」「平等—爲什麽當我第一次吻你的時候，你不早説？那天晚上和你一同出去的時候，你明明當我平等看待的。我相信你愛我的。原來你是和我開玩笑，尋尋開心。等到你尋開心尋够了。你就不管了。還要説什麽你是文明人，人家是野蠻。我告訴你！我不受那個」！黛兒挣扎開了他的手，滿口駡着：「放我走，你這下賤骯髒的獸類！放手」！她開了車門，跳了出去。正在這個時候，迎面來了一輛車，開得很快的過來。强尼很清楚的看見黛兒正在那車的前面，他不覺狂喊着：「黛兒」！可是已經來不及了。</p>
<p>這是最後的一幕。强尼拉米立斯在桑諾拉城裏禮拜堂内，對着神父懺悔一切的罪孽。喃喃之音止息了。神父高聲郎誦着贖罪的經咒，最後命令道：「我的孩子，以後你須行走和平之道，而忘祈禱之功」。强尼懺悔完了出來，他的母親接着一同出去。他們母子走到禮拜堂門口，那個神父亦已經走了出來。他問道强尼道：「現在你到那裏去，我的孩子」？强尼道：「到我所應到的地方。回到我的家鄉。回到我祖我宗，我種我族聚居的地方去」。</p>
<p>現在，如果你要尋找强尼拉米立斯，昔時拉露遠的主人，你可以在墨西哥人的田中去尋他。他穿着上下身相連的工衣，戴着大笠帽，手把着耕種機，一面前進，一面唱着歌。他明白了神父從前和他所説的話，叫他尋求靈魂上的平安，不要羡慕虚榮，不要懷抱野心，有什麽意義，有什麽好處。（完）</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Annual Meeting Speaks on the Future of China's Economy</h3>
<p>Deeply Wishes to Cooperate with Our Government</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation held its annual meeting this morning. Chairman Mackie gave a speech, the gist of which is as follows: "The current situation is difficult and has not yet ended. The instability of currency has added to the turmoil. A long-term struggle is necessary to clear the gloomy and desolate atmosphere of the ordinary world. What we need is a revival method that increases purchasing power and promotes the sale of inventory, rather than an artificial increase in prices. Regarding the US silver purchase plan, all I can say is that it only slightly benefits a very small number of people, but at the same time, it is a cause of serious chaos, and the country with one-fourth of the world's population will feel the pain even more. The US silver policy is not the only disturbing factor. The instability of China's finances is also due to improper handling of the current situation. The difference between the price of silver in Shanghai and London is extremely large, and the reduction of silver reserves in Shanghai and other places is inevitable. Hong Kong is also experiencing the same situation, but the bank maintains its current funds and keeps them flowing, so it can cope with large withdrawals and avoid exchange rate chaos. China's silver export tax and equalization tax are neither necessary nor appropriate, and they will not succeed. The restrictive impact of silver outflow is quite significant. Banks in Shanghai are forced to maintain their current funds with all their strength, which is detrimental to trade. I do not want to rush to predict the future of Chinese currency. What must be noted is that actions should be extremely cautious. Any action should not be taken without careful consideration and consultation with experienced people. I believe that the Chinese government should cooperate closely with the foreign exchange bankers in Shanghai. Their years of experience can be of great assistance in solving this difficult problem. Unfortunately, in the early stages of this crisis, the government did not consult with the bankers. It would be unfair to criticize the bankers for the subsequent results. However, the situation has improved greatly recently. The Chinese government has frequently consulted with Mr. Han Zhimeng, the manager of the Shanghai Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. We are now reviewing methods to remedy the situation. It goes without saying that we are eager to cooperate in implementing plans that can have a good effect. The continued rise in silver prices, while world prices lag behind, is very harmful to China. However, China can also help itself. The most important thing is that foreign payments can be organized without excessive difficulty. As for the general situation in the Far East, it is fraught with crises and requires careful and good political maneuvering to deal with it. Generally speaking, Sino-Japanese relations have now turned a corner compared to this time last year. This is a good sign. The unresolved issues in North China should make progress towards a formal resolution. Regarding local and domestic financial events, we have a long-standing and close relationship with important Chinese banks. We hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with them in raising foreign debts." Mackie then spoke about the status of Hong Kong, saying that although the trade situation continues to be depressed, government revenue has not decreased significantly. The state of Hong Kong's trade is merely a reflection of the current situation in China. The Economic Committee will soon issue a report that will contain good recommendations, but if China does not progress quickly, this report may not be able to provide much assistance and promote recovery. However, China has great potential, so he cannot be truly pessimistic about China's future. The tragic situation in Shanghai is also an obstacle to commercial progress, but he believes that a way will soon be found to break the deadlock. Mr. Hills then spoke, supporting the chairman's remarks, saying that if silver is a politically manipulated event and is not allowed to obtain its true value as a commodity, then we cannot hope for a stable and profitable Far Eastern trade situation. China's sound foreign trade can cure many of our pains. I hope that China will not be constrained by monetary difficulties and commercial restrictions, thereby hindering its development.

<h3>Great Britain Attaches Importance to the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the British political situation seems to have centered on the Far Eastern issue as the focus of its turmoil. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George initially attacked Foreign Secretary Simon's Far Eastern policy with cautionary words. Sir Lytton, the leader of the 1932 Manchurian Investigation Team, also published his theory of promoting British-American cooperation in Washington. General Smuts of the South African Federation further pointed out that the current policy adopted by Japan on the Far Eastern issue has a serious threat of making the Pacific a major danger zone in the world. The impact will involve China, Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain, and Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, and other autonomous regions, and the only way to eliminate this serious threat is mutual cooperation between Britain and the United States on world issues. British public opinion has also paid more attention to the opening of the Chinese door than before. It is generally believed that the recent changes in the Far Eastern situation should not be ignored by countries with extensive commercial interests in the Far East. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th of this month, the British Foreign Secretary thoroughly discussed the situation in the Far East with Guo Taiqi, our ambassador to the United Kingdom. Although the content of the conversation has not been revealed, the close attention of all sectors of British society to the Far Eastern issue and its public opinion's ability to influence diplomacy are very obvious.</p>
<p>On the Far Eastern stage, Great Britain has historically and in terms of political and economic relations been the most important role. The three successive Anglo-Japanese alliances, the Anglo-Russian division of sphere of influence, and the Anglo-German secret agreement all took maintaining a superior position in China as the center of their policies. However, after the European War, Great Britain suffered setbacks in its maritime hegemony, and its power in China retreated from the first place to the second. At the same time, the newly emerging power of Japan rose sharply. Great Britain had no choice but to temporarily take a defensive position in the Far East, but it never forgot about the development of its market interests in China.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Great Britain, with its extensive interests in the Far East, has had its every move greatly affect the development of the Far Eastern situation. Only because the old dream of the past Anglo-Japanese alliance was difficult to forget did the voices of mutual respect for British and Japanese interests in China arise. Later, Japan became complacent and even broadcast its voices of exclusively occupying East Asia, which made the Far Eastern issue even more deadlocked. This was perhaps not what Great Britain had expected. As for the United States, its domestic economic panic has not diminished and its military strength remains to be supplemented, so it has a great sense of being out of reach for the Far Eastern issue. The United States has recently had to temporarily disguise its passive attitude towards the Far Eastern issue with a good neighbor policy. Great Britain also simultaneously developed theories of non-interference in issues north of Singapore in order to seek temporary peace. Both are due to environmental relations and cannot be helped. From this point of view, the reason for the recent sharp turn in Sino-Japanese relations, its internal reason is indeed due to Japan's needs, and the development of the objective environment is indeed an important reason.</p>
<p>Now, Great Britain, in light of the recent developments in the Far Eastern situation, is sufficient to hinder its vested interests in China and feels that the past policy of wooing Japan was not a good idea. It has now begun to focus its attention on the Far Eastern issue in order to remedy the situation. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty was reintroduced, the policy toward China was re-examined, and even sought to call on the great powers to form a solid front to maintain its vested interests in China. The progress of this new contradiction is also worthy of great attention.</p>
<p>Our country is in such a dangerous environment that it cannot advance or retreat. Only by establishing a firm and unwavering policy to protect the independent survival of our nation can we hope to eliminate the great powers competing in China to brew war. However, General Goring said that if the sword is lost, peace is also lost. At a time when the atmosphere of superficial peace permeates East Asia, we need to pay attention to Goring's words.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Meets with Key Figures from the Japanese Army and Navy in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Leave Japan on March 1st to Return to The Hague</p>
<p>Members of the Japanese House of Representatives Invited Wang for a Heart-to-Heart Talk Yesterday</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Wang Chonghui visited General Araki Sadao, a military councillor, at his private residence, and left after an hour. Next, he went to the Ministry of the Navy to meet with Vice Admiral Kato of the Naval General Staff to exchange views on Sino-Japanese issues.

<p>[Tokyo] Hamada Kunimatsu, the speaker of the House of Representatives, hosted Wang Chonghui on the evening of the 22nd and held a welcome meeting. Wang said in his speech that he had not been in Japan for long, but he was very grateful for the great welcome he had received from your country. This is not my personal liking, but China's liking. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Repay virtue with virtue." All events must be based on this saying. China sincerely welcomes Foreign Minister Hirota's speech on restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. In fact, China is doing its best to eliminate things that Japan finds unpleasant. The reason for the unpleasantness is not to be eliminated by orders, but to be guided by virtue so that it is not exclusive, which is extremely important. (23rd Japanese News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Members of various factions of the House of Representatives with aspirations will hold a discussion meeting with Dr. Wang Chonghui at 4:00 p.m. on the 24th to exchange opinions on Sino-Japanese friendship, improving Eastern harmony, and other issues. The initiators of the House of Representatives are as follows:</p>
<p>"Seiyukai" (Friends of Politics Party) - Toshio Shimada, Yoshiei Horikiri, Minoru Togo, Tsutae Sugawara, Hitoshi Ashida; "Minseito" (Democratic Constitutional Party) - Keikichi Raishi, Ryutaro Nagai, Sakusaburo Uchisaki, Takeo Tanaka; "Kokumin Domei" (National Alliance) - Jōichi Yamamichi, Chōichi Katō; "Daiichi Kokushitsu" (First Study Room) - Isoo Abe, Masao Taki (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Congress Passes President's Signed Huge Army Budget</h3>
<p>Totaling 370 Million Gold</p>
<p>Expanding Troop Strength to Defend Against Foreign Enemies</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the Army budget signed by President Roosevelt today, the US Army may increase by 36,250 personnel. The bill stipulates a budget of $378,000,000. However, when the House passed the bill, it rejected Congressman Thomason's amendment, which mandated an increase of 11,000 troops. According to the Army Department budget passed by Congress, the increase in troop strength will be handled entirely by the department. If the General Staff and the Secretary of the Army decide to increase troop strength, the funds for increasing the army are already available. The discussion to increase the US Army has been ongoing for a long time, hence the passage of this bill. During the discussion of the bill, some said that although the United States is the richest country in the world and a great naval power, its army is the smallest. Many smaller countries not only have larger armies but also enact laws to make every young man a trained soldier. Many army and government officials believe that the current reserve officer system and National Guard are insufficient to repel foreign enemies. (22nd National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russia Denies Building Railway Between Chita and Kulum</h3>

<p>[Moscow] The Japanese Nichinichi Shimbun reported that the Soviet government, in accordance with an agreement with the Soviet-Mongolian government, has begun laying a main railway line between Chita and Kulum, with a length of 2,000 kilometers. Izvestia commented on this, saying, "The Soviet authorities have heard nothing about the construction of a railway between Chita and Kulum, nor about any agreement made by the Soviet-Mongolian government on this matter. This is entirely a fabrication by certain people in Manchuria, who are very interested in the Mongolian issue." (22nd TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Ranks First in the World</h3>
<p>More Than Tripled Compared to Three Years Ago</p>
<p>Nationwide Implementation of "People's Armament"</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Chief of Staff of the Soviet Air Force, Chrispin, recently gave a broadcast speech, stating, "In recent years, the Soviet government has been expanding the Air Force with all its might. Its current strength is more than tripled compared to three years ago. The carrying capacity of aircraft has more than doubled, and the speed of bombers and fighter planes has tripled. The reason for this is that we are forced by foreign aggression. As far as I know, the Soviet Air Force has become the best in the world, but we are still trying to strengthen it." (23rd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today is the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, so a grand propaganda event was held. Many important pieces of information were released, especially the "People's Armament" advocated by the "Voroshilov Groups," which attracted the most attention. According to official announcements, the groups have 13,238,000 members, including 113 flying squadrons, 2,000 flying glider schools, and 1,500 school rooms with 20,000 classrooms in their automobile teams, training 450,000 people. In the youth groups, 250,000 children aged ten to fifteen are receiving flight training, and there are also nine women's flying schools in the groups, specializing in coaching everything to prepare for women's supplementary work in the army. According to International Commissioner Voroshilov's speech in the group, in recent years, the Soviet Union has faced the possibility of war from time to time, because peace completely relies on the strength of the Navy, Army, and Air Force.

<h3>One-Eyed Air Squadron's Stratosphere Test Flight Fails</h3>
<p>Forced to Land Due to Oil Leak</p>
<p>Plans to Make Two More Attempts Within Days</p>
<p>Los Angeles Famous aviator Post departed from here today, intending to reach New York City, 2,450 miles away, via the stratosphere. Shortly after, he landed near Muroc Lake, only 125 miles away from here. Post had ascended to a height of 25,000 feet, about five miles from the ground, but had not yet reached the stratosphere. Due to an oil leak, he had to descend rapidly. The plane he was flying, the Winnie Mae, which he had flown around the world twice, was not seriously damaged. Post plans to make a second attempt with this plane in the next few days. The purpose of this trip is not only to win the honor of being the first to fly across the North American continent in the stratosphere but also to break the existing aviation record between Los Angeles and New York. Post was wearing a specially made "oxygen suit" and planned to fly at a height of 35,000 feet, with a speed of 350 miles per hour, estimating that the entire journey could be completed in seven hours.

<h3>Regarding London's Anglo-French Proposals, Germany Agrees to a Comprehensive Discussion</h3>
<p>Simon's Trip to Berlin is Only Exploratory in Nature</p>
<p>Engaging in Beneficial Discussions on East European Security Issues</p>
<p>[London] Talks between Britain and Germany regarding the content of the Anglo-French diplomatic note are currently underway. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, initial discussions in Berlin's diplomatic circles have revealed a complete consensus of opinion, believing that such talks should not be limited to the issue of a sky pact but should include the entire scope mentioned in the Anglo-French document, namely Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations and the establishment of East and Central European pacts. However, it has not yet been decided whether future talks will be handled by British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin or by German Foreign Minister Neurath coming to London. Judging from the situation, there is a greater possibility of Simon going to Germany, as this would allow German leader Hitler to directly participate in the talks. The issue of Simon visiting the Russian capital after the Anglo-German talks is also being considered. The issue of the East European pact is currently the biggest obstacle for general European allies. London has not yet fully considered this issue, but Londoners acknowledge that the existing non-aggression treaties can serve as the basis for future negotiations. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] According to semi-official news obtained by the press, all parties are very satisfied with the fact that Britain and Germany will directly negotiate the points raised by London. According to current predictions, British Foreign Secretary Simon will first visit the Paris authorities next week to discuss everything, and then visit Berlin the following week, accompanied by Lord Privy Seal Eden. As for whether Simon will make another trip to Moscow, it has not yet been determined. However, according to The Times, Simon will go to the Russian capital, and it seems that the doubts of Russia and Germany regarding the East European pact can be easily resolved. (23rd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon will soon go to Berlin to negotiate with German officials about Germany joining the Anglo-French air defense pact. German officials declared that, in principle, the German government supports the agreement to abolish certain clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, so that Germany can return to the ranks of the international community, which is especially welcomed by Germany. A British spokesperson stated that Foreign Secretary Simon's trip to Berlin does not hope to conclude an agreement, but only wants to understand Germany's position, so that British, French, and German officials can draft a detailed set of specific agreements and will contact all other signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles, such as Japan, before the final action is taken. (22nd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Envoy Inquires About Germany's Intentions, Major Obstacles Already Removed</p>
<p>[London] According to well-informed sources, British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps was instructed to inquire with the German government whether the various issues not mentioned in Germany's reply on February 14 could be subject to beneficial discussions between Britain and Germany. Phipps has now received a reply from the German government, stating that if British cabinet members come to Berlin, the German government is prepared to fully discuss the various issues proposed by Britain and France. People here insist that the exchange of views by British cabinet members in Germany will only be exploratory in nature and not formal negotiations. The results of the Anglo-German talks cannot determine Germany's acceptance, but since Germany has agreed to fully discuss various issues, the main obstacle for British cabinet members to visit Germany has been removed. Therefore, Foreign Secretary Simon may, within a dozen days, consult with French cabinet members and then set off for Germany, while it is also highly possible that the Foreign Secretary will visit Moscow along the way. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Cabinet Members' Visit to Moscow, Soviet Government Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>[London] It is generally believed that the Soviet government has formally notified the British Cabinet that if British cabinet members can visit the Soviet Union, the government of that country would be very pleased. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] British newspapers reported that Foreign Secretary Simon will continue to Moscow after visiting Berlin. Local newspapers have widely reported this. Recently, the Soviet government sent a note to Britain and France, stating its views on the London declaration of February 3, which has made a good impression on Britain and France. Local newspapers have expressed satisfaction with this. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France and Austria Continue Talks</h3>
<p>On Non-Interference in Internal Affairs Pact</p>
<p>Both Sides Are in Complete Agreement</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, French Prime Minister Flandin, Foreign Minister Laval, and Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Walterberger discussed the importance of Austria's position in the European security plan for a long time. According to French press reports, the Austrian leaders emphatically stated that this talk should not be expected to lead to any specific compromise, as the main purpose of this talk is to determine the Austrian government's policy. The Austrian Foreign Minister stated that he does not understand how any country can stay out of the Danube Pact. This statement is directed at Germany, but without specifying Germany. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] French officials and Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg held consecutive meetings today. This meeting is crucial to Austria's survival. Although as many as 10,000 demonstrators were waiting here to protest against Schuschnigg yesterday, Schuschnigg remained calm and lobbied France according to the planned policy. According to Schuschnigg, unless France and Britain provide financial or military assistance, Austria cannot resist the external forces of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Schuschnigg continued, if the current meeting does not achieve the expected results, then he supports the restoration of the Habsburg Dynasty. It is known that after the Franco-Austrian meeting, it will be followed by an Anglo-Austrian meeting. (23rd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>First Situation of the Talks</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Franco-Austrian cabinet members talked this morning, the accompanying staff of the Austrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, together with French Deputy Secretary-General Le Roux of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of Political Affairs Bardon, discussed some technical issues. In the afternoon, Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Weiderger will have a final talk with French Foreign Minister Laval, and then issue a formal communiqué. The impression gained from the first day of Franco-Austrian talks is extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Protecting Austria from External Forces</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the two countries issued a declaration to the press, which has made it clear that the two countries are in complete agreement on the main issues in the talks. What are these main issues? That is, the Danube countries' non-interference in each other's internal affairs pact. This pact was originally initiated by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval in Rome and was subsequently approved by the Anglo-French talks in London. The three countries of Britain, France, and Italy, which signed the Austrian Declaration of Independence, are now willing to guarantee this pact. The purpose of this non-interference pact is primarily to protect Austria from external aggression, so that the incident of the assassination of Dollfuss on July 25 last year will not happen again. This pact plan was endorsed by the Austrian government, because this pact, on the one hand, allows France's allied Little Entente countries to fulfill their wishes to stabilize the situation in Central Europe, and on the other hand, allows Austria to maintain its dignified independence, and since all relevant countries participate in the pact with equal rights, it is appropriate for the Austrian government to accept it.</p>
<p>Further Efforts to Promote Economic Organization</p>
<p>After the signing of this pact, further efforts should be made to promote the economic organization of the Danube region. The foundation for this economic organization was established during the Franco-Italian talks in Rome, with the aim of increasing trade in the relevant countries of Central Europe and reviving industry. Only in this way can the final result of the pacification of Central Europe be achieved. In addition, the Franco-Austrian talks also mentioned various cultural issues related to the two countries. It goes without saying that the two countries will find it easier to reach an understanding on these issues. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Austria and France Declare Willingness to Work for Peace</h3>

At the same time, Austrian Foreign Minister Weiderger declared that Austria's foreign policy has always tended to maintain independence and peace, and therefore Austria will strengthen its ties with France. The official communiqué of the Franco-Austrian talks will probably be released tomorrow. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saving Europe Depends on International Coordination</h3>
<p>[Paris] Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg recently answered inquiries from press representatives and made a speech, stating that to save Europe, international coordination is indispensable. Austria is willing to assume a peaceful mission in the Danube region and participate in European cooperation. As for Austria's internal affairs, the path chosen by former Prime Minister Seipel and Dollfuss is the only bright path for Austria. We are determined to go through with it. We do not believe that new turmoil will occur in Austria, because Austria will no longer become a testing ground for National Socialism and Marxism. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Leader of French Socialist Party Arrested</h3>
<p>[Paris] According to today's newspapers, the arrest of Socialist leader Lebreton was the result of a letter written by right-wing figures in the municipal government to the police chief. The reason for his arrest was that Lebreton organized a crowd in front of the station to hate the Austrian Prime Minister and insulted the Austrian Prime Minister. The letter stated that a certain French royalist was recently sentenced to 12 months in prison for insulting the Flandin government. This kind of treatment can also be applied to those who insult foreign politicians. If the police chief considers Lebreton to be a member of parliament and cannot be arrested, then at least he should be investigated. (23rd National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Following the French Army's Old Tricks in Morocco, Italy Decides to Conquer Abyssinia by Force</h3>
<p>Constructing Fortifications on the Border, Large Army Waiting for Attack</p>
<p>American Black Aviator Goes to the Philippines to Help Abyssinia Fight</p>
<p>Naples From today onwards, Italy will implement the plan for Italian troops to stay for a long time at the border between Italy and Abyssinia. In addition to the 3,000 soldiers who recently went to East Africa to assist the local Italian army, another 800 military doctors and engineering team officers and 1,300 laborers left for the front line today. Officials announced that another 1,700 soldiers have been mobilized and are ready to depart at any time. Military doctors and engineering team officers, led by General Graziani, departed on the Fulkonia after being inspected by the Crown Prince. As for the laborers, they left Guinea by boat yesterday and will go to the front line to build barracks. If a war breaks out between Italy and Abyssinia, they will also invade Abyssinia and build fortifications. It is said that the 1st Missile Combat Regiment, which was ordered to concentrate in the next few days, will soon board the ship and join the Italian army in Somaliland. The Abyssinian capital believes that the dispatch of medical officers and engineering teams is quite important. It is said that this move by the Italian government indicates that if the League of Nations Committee fails to mediate, Italy will follow France's plan to quell the Moroccan rebellion and adopt a severe plan. It is known that Italian troops will bring materials to build bridges in the valleys and station barracks around the rocky mountains. The laborers serving in the camp will build small fortresses at night at the army's garrison. In short, the Italian army will copy the French army's old tricks to conquer the tribes of the Fez region. However, the Abyssinian government is ignoring Italy's threats and still insists that the thugs who harass the Somaliland border are not Abyssinians but bandits. (22nd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy's mobilization affairs have been completed, and now officials, medics, and laborers are being transported from several ports to Northeast Africa. A war with Abyssinia is feared to be inevitable. During the mobilization, newspapers were prohibited from publishing any news about this. The ban has now been lifted, so newspapers are describing the departure of the army in detail. The war fever is spreading across the country. Newspapers are now severely criticizing Abyssinia and praising Prime Minister Mussolini and the departing army to arouse the national patriotic enthusiasm, and the Abyssinian people's aggressive acts are described in great detail. Tonight, the Volcania mail ship, carrying 2,000 soldiers, left Naples for Messina, where it will select another 2,000 elite troops to carry on to Northeast Africa. The Volcania carries various war commissioners and medics and workers from Italian cities. When the ship departed, many people gathered at the pier to see it off, and the sounds of cheers and war songs echoed each other, and military bands played music to help the excitement. Women waved their handkerchiefs to say goodbye to their loved ones and made flying kisses. General Graziani, the chief of staff of the expedition, also took this ship to Africa. At the same time, it was heard that the Italian mail ship Biancamano, which travels between Europe and the Americas, will also depart from Messina tomorrow, carrying 3,000 soldiers to Italian Somaliland. In recent years, all mail ships have been modified into transport ships, and this ship is one of them. Tonight, 1,300 technicians from Northern Italy left Genoa on the transport ship Machiavelli Rosso for Africa. The send-off crowd shouted various slogans and was also extremely busy for a while. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] The situation of diplomatic negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia has not changed. The Italian government previously requested the Abyssinian government to set up a neutral zone on the border between Italian and Abyssinian territories, but it has not yet received a response from the Abyssinian government. A famous American black aviator, Colonel Julian, nicknamed "Black Hawk," departed from New York tonight for Africa, intending to help Abyssinia fight if a war breaks out between Italy and Abyssinia. Another five black aviators will also continue to go to Africa to participate in the war, because the black area of New York regards Abyssinia as its compatriot and has a deep impression of the recent Italian-Abyssinian conflict. In addition, British diplomatic representatives in Italy and Abyssinia are working hard to mediate, seeking a friendly resolution to the dispute between the two countries, and on the other hand, they are requesting that if the disputed area on the Abyssinian border is designated as a neutral zone, British expatriates in the Somaliland area should be guaranteed the use of the area's springs.

<h3>Italy Applies Military Pressure, Abyssinian Government Appeals to Germany</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The Abyssinian government today ordered its Consul General stationed here to lodge a complaint with the German government about Italy sending a large army to Somaliland, saying that the Abyssinian government had strictly abided by the agreement established by the two countries on February 17 to open a neutral zone, but Italy still sent troops to the Eritrean region of Somaliland, intending to apply military pressure to the negotiations for the demarcation of the neutral zone.

<h3>Trends in British Politics</h3>
<p>MacDonald's Leadership Qualification is Gradually Losing Popular Support</p>
<p>Lloyd George Actively Promoting the New Deal Movement</p>
<p>[London] Whether Prime Minister MacDonald should continue to be the leader of a government united across the country is now a serious issue for discussion in political circles. Conservative MP Churchill said in a speech somewhere last night that the Conservative Party is suffering under MacDonald's government. If Baldwin decides that we should participate in the general election under this kind of leader, then he will never agree to take this path. Churchill's remarks undoubtedly pose a major threat to the unity of the Conservative Party. The embers that have been lurking in the party for a long time may be ignited. Most members of the Conservative Party now wholeheartedly support the Prime Minister, but although they acknowledge his contribution to the country during the political turmoil of 1931, they have never shown too much enthusiasm for his leadership qualifications. Liberal leader George is now engaged in the New Deal movement. In a speech in Manchester yesterday, he said that the Prime Minister's efforts on the unemployment issue made him feel that the relief plan was more harmful than beneficial. The fact that the plan is extremely difficult to understand is clearly inconsistent with the various remarks he has made. The Prime Minister's loss of popular support among the Labour Party is greater than that of any former Labour cabinet member. This can be seen from the recent attacks by Labour MPs in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's speech in the House of Commons today is not as well received as Baldwin's occasional speech. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's eye disease has relapsed due to overwork recently, which is also one of the reasons why the question of whether he can continue to serve as Prime Minister has arisen.

<h3>American Ship Runs Aground in Defense Zone, Japanese Suspect</h3>
<p>Navy Sends Warships to Investigate Extensively</p>
<p>Order to Stop the Ship is Immediately Cancelled</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The American oil tanker Ellichabe Kellogg ran aground at Cape Konron, the defense zone at the northern entrance of Tokyo Bay, which aroused suspicion among the Japanese authorities. According to Kokumin Shimbun, the naval authorities have sent a destroyer to inspect the ship. The captain of the ship interrogated the captain and thirty crew members. The newspaper said that the captain gave an "unconscious answer" to the question of why he ran aground in the defense zone. The naval authorities then sent a radio message to the captain, saying that he must not leave the area even if he gets out of danger. Furthermore, the steamship Zirind Latuliff also ran aground at Nojima Cape due to strong winds, but fortunately it was not in the defense zone. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to a report from the Yokosuka Naval Air Force, the stranded American oil tanker was struck by huge waves and was in a dangerous state. Several fishing boats were seen taking sailors ashore. It is now believed that all the people on board have been rescued. The naval authorities have sent a destroyer to help rescue, fearing that the cargo ship will be completely lost. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The American steamship Kellogg, 15,890 tons, ran aground in the fortress area of Tokyo Bay on the 22nd. The authorities considered that there was a deliberate grounding. As a result of the investigation by the Tokyo Garrison Command, it was learned that after the ship left Yokohama, the captain was drunk, and the third officer took over the opening of the ship on his behalf. Being unfamiliar with the geography, he ran aground. The authorities lifted the stop-ship order on the 23rd. (23rd Japan Union Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The British ship Casarin ran aground on the Yawata sea off Chiba Prefecture, Japan, at 5 am on the 23rd. The Tateyama Air Force received the report and immediately sent a plane to investigate. At the same time, the destroyer Tachikaze was dispatched to rescue. However, there are many reefs in the area, and rescue seems difficult. (23rd Japan Union Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yokosuka After the reconnaissance plane dispatched by the Tateyama Naval Air Force flew to the grounding site of the British ship Casarin and investigated the situation, it reported to the Yokosuka Naval Base by radio that the ship was 3,000 tons, fully loaded with wood, and the hull was tilted 30 degrees to the right. The hull did not seem to be damaged. There are now three salvage ships on its side. The wind speed is 7 meters, and the sea waves are very high. (23rd Japan Union Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] The World Maritime Conference will be held in Berlin in June to discuss the scrapping of 9 million tons of tied-up ships in order to revitalize the struggling global shipping industry.

According to today's news, due to the breakdown of negotiations with the United States, the Russian government has decided to transport cash to London to repay its debts to British merchants, no longer shipping it to the United States as before.

<h3>美工賑案政府又告勝利</h3>
<p>US Public Works Bill: Government Achieves Another Victory</p>
<p>Senate Proposes Amendment</p>
<p>Rejected by the Appropriations Committee</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, the government submitted President Roosevelt's $4,880,000,000 public works bill to the Appropriations Committee. This move indicates that President Roosevelt has been successful in blocking the implementation of the amendment proposed by the Senate yesterday. The amendment advocated for the payment of prevailing wages and opposed the president's living wage plan. Government officials admitted that this move was risky, as some believed that the current wage clause would pose a major obstacle to the president's plan. Supporters of the president's plan claimed that the amendment would prevent many people from obtaining government jobs. The government faction holds a majority on the Appropriations Committee, so the Senate's amendment was first rejected by the committee. However, in the Senate, the opposition passed the amendment by a vote of 44 to 43. Labor leaders claimed that if the president's plan were implemented, the nation's secret wage structure would collapse. However, the president stated that the White House would use its power to prevent this crisis. It is said that the president hopes to provide jobs for 35 million people under the public works bill. If the government is forced to pay prevailing wages, the president will be unable to achieve his goal. (22nd National Electric)</p>

<p>Overview of the Recent Changes and Disturbances in Xinjiang (2)</p>
<p>After Hami separately established the two counties of Yiwo and Yihe in October of the 19th year, by February of the following year, when preparations were being made to commence land survey, the local Turban people suddenly stirred up trouble due to a small shop incident. The reasons for this matter are complex, and distant rumors mostly say that this reform of converting land to the central government and separately establishing counties was a very simple motive for the incident. In reality, the brewing of the disaster and its inevitable eruption, even without the establishment of counties, would have occurred with another incident. It just happened to erupt suddenly during the period of the land reform. Although the reform of local administration was something that the general Turban people had hoped for for many years, it was not achieved due to the Hui King's strong opposition. Now that they had finally broken free from restraint and their wish had been fulfilled, they should have been rejoicing, so why would there be this incident?</p>
<p>The reason is that Hami is over a thousand li long from east to west and two or three hundred li wide from north to south, uneven, mostly vast and sparsely cultivated. The Hui King's fiefdoms and the land he had added account for about 40-50% of the land of the Hui region, and the fields are crisscrossed with fertile land. According to the old system of the Hui region, the Hui King's land was cultivated and harvested by the Turban people, and a certain number of people had to be sent to the King's mansion every day to perform chores. The supplies were so numerous that even minor things like brooms had to be obtained from the Turban people. And the land of their leaders, such as the Da Taiji, Xiao Taiji, Beike, Da Ergua, Milafu, Huerma, and Mao Tizi, also had to be cultivated and harvested by the Turban people. In addition, several people from each Turban household had to be sent to the homes of each leader to perform chores every day. In a month, each Turban household had only about six or seven days to do their own work. The rest of the time was spent doing chores for the Hui King and the leaders. The wives and daughters also took turns to perform duties. The leaders had enormous rights and privileges. Once the county system was established and they were under the jurisdiction of the county, not only would they completely lose all the benefits and privileges they had previously enjoyed, but they would also have to go to the county granary to pay taxes like the general Turban people. Therefore, they fabricated rumors such as the Turban people's long-cultivated land would be allocated to Han people for cultivation, and the Han people would marry the wives and daughters of the Turban people, and spread these rumors everywhere to incite people. The general Turban people did not understand the truth and alarmed each other, moving away in droves. Although the government sent officials to try their best to appease them, due to the separation of religion and customs, they could not directly explain to the general public. The Turban people had simple minds and spread rumors, and the incident therefore broke out.</p>
<h3>The Valiant Turban Soldiers</h3>
<p>At that time, the Hui King's land had not yet been disposed of, and the wasteland had not yet been allocated. As the incident grew day by day, distant rumors from within the passes also varied from person to person, saying that the Turban people who cultivated the Hui King's land were allowed to receive licenses to sow seeds. Some of the land that had not been cultivated or had already been cultivated was issued to refugees from Gansu for planting. Han people who reclaimed wasteland were exempt from taxation, and the treatment was very unequal compared to the Turban people. All these were exaggerated and fabricated words. The refugees who were victims in the old Mao Lake, where the Yiwo County was to be established, were in the most miserable situation. Because Yiwo County required digging canals before reclaiming wasteland, and the first requirement for digging canals was manpower, they rented 30 dan of Hui King's old Mao Lake land, ordering the refugees to plant the land on one hand and dig canals on the other. After the canals were dug, the wasteland was allocated, which initially did not hinder the interests of the Turban people there. Unexpectedly, the incident broke out as soon as they arrived.</p>
<p>The so-called small shop incident was that a non-Muslim Han military officer guarding the pass secretly married a Turban woman. The Turban people hated him to the bone for violating religious rules, believing that the rumor that the Han people wanted to marry the wives and daughters of the Turban people had actually been confirmed. Therefore, one person advocated and everyone responded, and they rose up in rebellion, first killing the Han soldiers guarding the pass, then the Han residents. At the same time, old Mao Lake, Tu Hulu, and the first, second, and third forts also rose up in response. Among them, the refugees who were going to old Mao Lake to plant land and dig canals were all planted in the soil, only exposing their heads, and it was most tragic to have fierce horses drag huge logs horizontally to trample and crush them to death. The Han people who suffered casualties or fled could not be counted. The houses were also burned down and are still ruins today.</p>
<p>More than ten of the Han officials and civilians in the various post stations and branch checkpoints around Hami suffered tragic disasters. Among the Turban leaders, a small number originally had firearms, and with the increase in weapons in various victories, they gathered the masses and attacked Hami City fiercely. The provincial government received the report and, on one hand, sent officials to appease them, and on the other hand, mobilized troops to suppress them. The elderly among the Turban people were willing to express remorse under reasonable conditions, and some had already surrendered. However, the leaders believed that the matter had become too big, and even if they contained it, it would be difficult to obtain the understanding of the provincial government. Therefore, they pretended to express their allegiance to the provincial government and secretly contacted Ma Zhongying, who was stationed in Jiuquan, asking him to send troops to help. Ma had previously sent people to Hami to incite rebellion and had long intended to enter Xinjiang. Moreover, he had just been defeated by Ma Bufang's army and was worried that he had nowhere to develop. Therefore, in May of that year (the 20th year), he took the opportunity to sneak into Xinjiang, besieged Hami, and ravaged Zhenxi, Liaodun, Qijiaojing, and other places, and used religious relations to incite the Turban Hui in other places. When the provincial army arrived in Hami, they followed the provincial government's telegram, "Only ask if they are bandits, don't ask if they are Hui," and combined suppression and pacification. After half a year, it still did not subside. Later, because Ma himself was injured, he retreated to Liaojiawan, which belonged to Hami. The provincial army continued to come east, and Hami City was even more difficult to attack. In October, he secretly escaped back to Gansu, occupying An, Dun, Yu, Su, and other counties, gathering people to build up strength, in order to rise again.</p>
<p>The Turban people have always held the principle of "live in the countryside in peaceful years, go to the mountains in chaotic years." Seeing Ma's army defeated and returning to Gansu, they also retreated to the Tianshan Mountains, driving away and killing the nomadic Mongols who lived together, and defending themselves by relying on dangerous terrain. The provincial army was unfamiliar with the terrain and paths, and also wanted to avoid further escalation of the situation, so they only sent reputable Turban people to appease them. The Turban people also knew that their strength was weak and difficult to resist, so they pretended to be compliant. The war temporarily came to an end. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Implementation of the Pseudo-Organization of Coal and Oil Monopoly</h3>
<p>Establishing Supervisory and Management Office to Govern Various Sales Societies</p>
<p>Wholesale Agents Plan to Start Sales on April 1st</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese army's economic invasion plan in our Northeast is now to establish various societies to control it. They are eager to exhaust all rights and interests. For example, the much-publicized coal and oil monopoly has recently been finalized and announced for implementation. In the future, all rights to freely sell international coal and oil in our Northeast will be exclusively owned by the Japanese army. The purpose is not only to monopolize profits, but also to completely control it once the Far East war breaks out for military use. The pseudo-Ministry of Finance is currently planning to temporarily establish ten sales societies throughout Manchuria. The sales management personnel for the ten societies are also being allocated. The ratio of the amount of imported oil to the amount of southern oil is also determined by the pseudo-government, and the purchase prices and the sales prices of the various sales societies are also determined, which can be determined according to the situation in various places. However, the initial annual quantity of coal and oil monopoly is estimated to be 20 million gallons. New establishment of coal and oil storage and special freight rates of the South Manchuria Railway are also underway. By the end of March, all preparations can be made properly, and it can be seen in practice from April 1st. It is heard that the general wholesale agent for the pseudo-organized coal and oil monopoly has long been selected by the pseudo-government. The selected number is divided as follows: Texaco 14, Soviet Union 2, Manchurian-Japanese merchants 14, Asiatic Petroleum 18, Standard Oil 21, Other 6, totaling 79. It is heard that the number of wholesale agents to be designated recently is about 300, most of whom are designated by the previous general wholesale agents. As for remote places where there are no designated wholesale agents, it is planned that the local governments will designate and report. In short, the pseudo-organization will always adhere to the Japanese's established rights policy and move towards the path of monopoly. (Northeast Society)</p>
<h3>Survey of the Confucius Temple Project</h3>
<p>—Talk by Liang Sicheng—</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhong Lingxiu, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education; Tang Wencong, Section Chief of the Ministry of Interior; Liang Sicheng, expert in ancient architecture engineering; Kong Lingcan, Secretary and Director of the Provincial Department of Education; Yu Gaomin, Wang Jizhong, Li Zhongxuan, technicians of the Department of Construction; Yang Judou and Sun Zhonglin, technical assistants, etc., went to Qufu from Jinan on the 19th to survey the Confucius Temple project. On the 20th, they used wooden supports as scaffolding, and Liang personally climbed on it to survey the various halls. Kong Lingcan represented the Kong family to host the leaders. They surveyed it again very thoroughly yesterday (the 21st). Tang Wencong, Zhong Lingxiu, Liang Sicheng, Kong Lingcan, etc., left Qufu at 1:00 pm for the station, while the others and Liang Sicheng's assistant, Mo Zongjiang, stayed in Qufu for detailed surveys. After Tang and others arrived at the South Station, Zhong and Tang took the train to Beijing to report, while Liang returned to Jinan last night (the 21st) and got off the train. The reporter met Liang on the train and asked about the survey. According to him, "I initially thought that the Confucius Temple project in Qufu was huge, and it would be difficult to make a detailed survey during the first short visit. But after arriving in Qufu, the wooden poles and hemp ropes were all complete. A wooden frame of seven or eight zhang high should be tied together to climb on, so that a detailed survey could be made. There is no major damage to the roofs of the various places. The most important thing is rain leakage. It is different from the nature of the Forbidden City. The main hall and Kuiwen Pavilion are more important. Both corridors also need to be repaired. I also uncovered the roof tiles to check the framework (i.e., the large wooden materials such as beams and pillars), which are still usable. However, the small wooden materials such as the eaves beams around the four sides must be replaced. I intend to replace them with cement, while the exterior remains in the style of wood, in order to be strong and preserve the old appearance of the historical sites. Since this survey is very detailed, we can start designing. The technicians and my (Liang's self-description) assistant Mo Zongjiang and the surveyors are all staying in Qufu for detailed measurements, which will be completed in about six or seven days. The measurement results will be drawn into a plan and sent to Peiping as a reference for my design, so as to prepare a plan book. The book is planned to be sent to Nanjing and the Shandong Department of Construction. The plan book will be prepared in about three weeks. I still have to come to Jinan once. The two section chiefs Zhong and Tang will also come to Jinan at that time to discuss everything in detail. As for the estimation of the total project cost, because the value of materials such as wood is not very clear, it is currently impossible to estimate," etc. Li Weixia, an inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Xu Meisheng, an inspector of the Department of Education, were dispatched to Qufu to investigate the descendants of the four sages Yan, Zeng, Si, and Meng. They also took the train back to Jinan yesterday. According to them, because the descendants of all the sages are in Qufu, the investigation is very easy and has been completed. Previously, there were some disputes among the descendants of Zengzi, which have now been completely resolved, etc.</p>
<h3>Famine Victims in Hefei and Chaoxian Counties, Anhui Province, Cause Disturbances</h3>
<p>The reason is that they have difficulty making a living</p>
<p>Security teams rushed to suppress them</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the past, farmers in Chaoxian and Hefei counties in Jiangbei, Anhui Province, mostly made a living by planting tobacco seedlings and did not pay attention to the production and sales of grain. The value of tobacco seedlings was about eight or nine times higher than that of grain. Therefore, the number of households planting tobacco seedlings increased year by year. Seeing this situation, the provincial authorities believed that it had a huge impact on the future of the people's food supply. They repeatedly ordered local officials to supervise the eradication, but for several years, not only did they fail to fundamentally eliminate it, but it also caused several riot cases. Because the cunning people among the planting households all have organizations called the Red Spear Society and the Yellow Spear Society, which ostensibly display self-defense signs, but in reality are armed forces to resist the government's eradication of seedlings. Last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek held the determination to eradicate all poisons and strictly limited the Anhui Provincial Government to thoroughly eradicate the tobacco seedlings in that area and never allow them to be planted again. At the same time, he dispatched personnel and military police, etc., to rush to the area to assist, and finally, in the shortest possible time, completely eradicated the deeply rooted tobacco seedlings. Since then, the farmers in the counties of Jiangbei, Anhui Province, have not dared to take the risk and have converted the original tobacco fields to plant various dry and wet grains. However, due to the unprecedented drought last year, the majority of the autumn harvest was hopeless, and they suddenly felt difficulty in making a living, resulting in disturbances by famine victims in recent months. According to reliable news, more than a thousand starving people have recently gathered in the area bordering Jieji and Wenji, and Shitou Bridge in the border area of Hefei and Chaoxian counties, and are causing disturbances in the vicinity. After receiving the report, the governments of Chaoxian and Hefei counties have sent security teams to suppress them. The Second District Commissioner's Office of Wuhu also sent the Deputy Commander of the Security Forces, Hu Peigeng, to supervise the security teams of Wuhu, Dangtu, Nanling and other counties, totaling about a thousand people, to open up the area and suppress them. At the same time, they telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that it be rescued to avoid the expansion of the situation and stabilize the area. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Tragedy of Refugees from Xiangxiang, Hunan, in Qingpu and Maodao</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence from the Daily News: On February 12th of this year, refugees from Xiangxiang, Hunan, who had fled the famine, caused trouble with the villagers in the Maodao Village area under the jurisdiction of the Second District of Qingpu County, resulting in the drowning of people. The newspapers have reported on this matter for days. In order to clarify the truth of the matter, the reporter (of the Daily News) personally went to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate the process in detail. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>Maodao is under the jurisdiction of the Second District of Qingpu. First, at the end of the lunar year last year, more than a thousand refugees claiming to be from Xiangxiang, Hunan, passed through the area and requested assistance from the local authorities. Although the authorities believed that the rural economy had declined in recent years and the people were also haggard, they thought that since the refugees had arrived in the area to beg for food, they should try their best to raise funds and food for relief, and ordered the refugees to leave the area according to regulations. The refugees left in two batches, but within a few days, one batch of refugees, about 300 people, suddenly returned to Maodao Village in the Second District of the county. The village is located on the shore of Dianshan Lake and is known for its poverty and barrenness. After the batch of refugees arrived, they went to the villagers to ask for clothes and food. The villagers also gave them some relief, but the refugees still did not disperse. At that time, it happened to be the lunar New Year. Two families in the village were holding wedding ceremonies. The refugees knew that the brides' jewelry and the money brought by the guests must be a lot, and they thought it was a great opportunity. Therefore, they used the excuse of asking for relief and mobilized all 300 people to rush in two ways. At that time, the two wedding houses were holding banquets for guests. The refugees entered the door and did not distinguish between black and white, and rushed to the table to eat. The guests scattered in panic. Seeing the guests fleeing, the refugees broke into the inner room and swept away the valuable ornaments in the bridal chamber and all the cash in the house. Before leaving, they destroyed all the rice, grain, and furniture. At the same time, they shouted that they would do it to the end, and divided into batches to rob all the residents in the village. For a time, the order of the entire village was in chaos. The traffic in that area was inconvenient, and the police station was far away. As a result, three or four villagers who escaped later were surrounded and beaten by the large number of refugees, extorting money. Therefore, one or two courageous villagers came up with a desperate plan and had to sound the gong to warn and gather the villagers in the neighboring villages. For a time, the villagers became more and more crowded. The refugees knew that they had caused trouble, so they tried to retreat to avoid punishment. Fearing that the villagers would catch up, they retreated while picking up bricks and tiles on the ground and throwing them. Several villagers were injured by the throwing. The villagers were indignant that the refugees were committing murder and injuring people in addition to robbery. They were all moved by public outrage and desperately chased after them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the refugees stepped up their retreat and fled back to their original ship. The ship where the refugees were crowded was parked on the bank of a tributary of Dianshan Lake behind the village. At the same time, Maodao Village was surrounded by water on three sides, and the villagers were chasing from the main road on land. In addition to fleeing back to the original ship in Dianshan Lake, the refugees had no other place to go. Although the lake surface of the tributary was not wide, the water was very deep. The refugees were numerous and unfamiliar with the geography. They rushed onto the ship, and the ship capsized. As a result, some drowned, and some were rescued. At the same time, the refugees who arrived later saw that the ship had capsized and thought that the lake surface was narrow, so they planned to swim away. How could they know that the bottom of the lake was extremely deep? Most of the refugees were not familiar with water, so most of them drowned again. By the time the authorities heard the news and sent the police to rush to the scene, it was already a fait accompli, and the villagers were timid and scattered. The reporter went to inspect yesterday and saw that there were only a few villagers in Maodao, and the place was messy, as if it had been robbed. It is known that the disturbances at that time were so severe that it caused such a great disaster.</p>
<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>After the incident, the Second District immediately met with the chief of the Public Security Bureau, etc., and went to the scene of the incident to inspect it. They also went to the village to search for and arrest more than ten villagers who caused the trouble. At the same time, they began to prepare for the aftermath of the injured and dead villagers and refugees. The next day, County Chief Qian Jiaxiang personally went to the countryside with the district chief and bureau chief to inspect the situation and examined and coffined the bodies of the dead and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. Most of the drowned had no injuries. County Chief Qian has reported the details to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions on how to handle them in recent days.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Measurement of Songjiang-Fengxian Highway Begins</p>
<p>The provincial construction department previously agreed to the request of local people in Songjiang to open a highway from Songjiang to Fengxian to facilitate transportation. After sending personnel to survey, it was considered necessary and decided to send personnel to Songjiang to start the measurement. It is estimated that the measurement cost will be more than 1,800 yuan. It is planned to allocate the funds from the unallocated funds for the measurement of the seven-province highway. Personnel were sent to Songjiang the other day to start the measurement. As soon as it is completed and reported to the province for approval, construction will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Suspects in the Yixing Jailbreak Case</p>
<p>In November of last year, Zhong Jingcheng, the county magistrate of Yixing, found that Gu Tongsun, the director of the county's land tax collection, and his brother Gu Lianxun, owed more than one million in land taxes and had committed major fraud. He detained and investigated Gu, etc. On the 16th of last month, County Chief Zhong went to the province for official business. Unexpectedly, Gu, etc., suddenly escaped from prison that night. The warden of the detention center, Dong Shanpei, etc., were dismissed and placed under surveillance. Recently, County Chief Zhong learned that Gu, etc., had made arrangements before escaping, and had pre-hired two cars from Guangxing Automobile Company No. 390 in this county and Xingchang Automobile Company No. 281 to drive to the gate of Hangzhou. Therefore, it is believed that the two cars are highly suspicious. The other day, he sent Detective Pan Jie to Wuxi with a document to jointly arrest Wang Baohe, the owner of Xingchang Automobile Company, and Chen Qiuhai, the driver of Guangxing Automobile Company, and escort them to Yixing for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Red Pill Organization Cracked in a Small Boat</p>
<p>There are many organizations selling drugs in the Yangjian area on the border of Xichang, and their actions are secretive, making it difficult to crack them. The authorities' bans are now strict, and the drug manufacturing organizations are even more mysterious. The other day, the Baoan Corps cracked one case, which was very strange. The drug trafficking organization was not on land, but hired a giant boat filled with various machines for manufacturing red pills. They traveled everywhere, selling during the day and manufacturing at night, so they could not be cracked. On the evening of the 19th, the Zhangjiaqiao Baoan Corps patrolled to the Xiawei Village area. At that time, it was silent, and only a boat was seen anchored in the river, with bright lights. The squad members suspected that it was a bandit and boarded the boat for inspection. They found that they were manufacturing red pills, so they took the machines and raw materials, 15 catties of white sugar powder, half a sack of medicinal powder, and the criminals back to the team headquarters. It is said that one of them is Luo Bingjun, a native of Yangjian, and there are also Zhang De and Qiu Musheng, natives of Guangdong. They directly admitted to manufacturing drugs. On the 21st, they were transferred by the Liantang Public Security Bureau to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Investigates Suspects in the Shi Case</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, attaches great importance to the assassination of Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper. A few days ago, he specially ordered the sections to take out all the case files of the Shi case and submit them to Huang for personal review, which has now been completed. Considering that the two suspects, Tang Yunsheng and Fu Xijiang, have many doubts, it is planned to investigate further and send personnel to Shanghai and other places to search for evidence. As for the suspect Yu Gang, who was arrested by the Haining Public Security Bureau in Nanhui, Jiangsu, he has been escorted to the province and is being temporarily detained by the Provincial Public Security Bureau. Personnel from the Provincial Government are conducting a thorough interrogation in order to obtain clues. Zhang Wentian, a suspect who was released on bail by the Hangzhou Court, was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Hall Committee Arrives in Funing for Inspection</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, in order to understand the financial situation of various counties north of the Yangtze River and strive for rectification, specially appointed Wang Maoqing, director of the first section of the third division, to inspect the counties. Wang arrived in Funing by boat yesterday and started the inspection today. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, he convened a meeting of various agencies at the county government. The main points were rectifying tax collection, reducing the burden on the people, and how the accounting director handles the county's finances, and how the treasury is managed. Afterwards, he went to Dongkan to inspect the grain tax sub-office.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Grain Tax Collection Officer Imprisoned for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Guo Xixian and Qiu Lianhui, staff members of the county's Grain Tax Collection Office, have embezzled public funds amounting to 60,000 yuan over the years. County Magistrate Chen discovered this and interrogated and imprisoned Guo Xixian and others, ordering them to return the funds within a limited time. After this incident, people from all walks of life generally believe that the county's grain tax has been deeply mired in malpractices, making it difficult to rectify local finances, and the funding of various agencies cannot be issued on time. Now that the malpractices have been discovered, it is hoped that the department will severely punish them to deter corruption. Yesterday, Chen Jie, Tang Yanqi, and others jointly petitioned the Department of Finance to send capable personnel to Haimen for a thorough investigation to clear up the long-standing malpractices.</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Plane No. 3 on the Ping-Yue Line Crashes in Yizhang</h3>
<p>Crashed Due to Fog, Losses Relatively Light</p>
<p>Schedule Remains Normal, Not Affected</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Civil Aviation Corporation's Plane No. 3 on the Ping-Yue (Beiping-Guangzhou) line crashed in Yizhang County on the morning of the 22nd. There were no passengers on board. The plane encountered fog and crashed. The company was informed and dispatched Plane No. 8 from Hankou yesterday morning to provide assistance at the crash site. The details of the crash are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Accident</p>
<p>The No. 3 plane took off from Beiping for Guangzhou at 7:50 AM on the 20th. The pilot was Mr. Carlbert. It arrived in Changsha at around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 21st. Due to bad weather, it stayed in Changsha that day. It took off from Changsha for Guangzhou on the morning of the 22nd. Unexpectedly, the weather changed suddenly after the plane took off. When it reached the Yizhang County boundary between Hunan and Guangdong, the mountainous terrain was covered in fog, and the aircraft was damaged, causing it to crash.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Assistance</p>
<p>Because the plane crashed in a remote area, no one noticed it for a while. Several hours later, the Hunan Highway Bureau learned of the crash and informed the Civil Aviation Corporation's Changsha office. The office dispatched engineer Dong Jiaxie and other employees by car to the crash site to provide assistance. The aircraft suffered relatively minor damage from the crash. The pilot Carlbert and the radio operator were both injured, but not seriously. They were immediately sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Returning the Damaged Aircraft</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, the general manager of the Civil Aviation Corporation in this city, received a report from the company's Changsha office on the evening of the 22nd and telegraphed the company's Hankou office to dispatch a plane for assistance. The Hankou office dispatched Plane No. 8 at around 5:00 AM on the 23rd to provide assistance and transfer the mail from Plane No. 3 to Guangzhou. As for the No. 3 plane, the damage was relatively light, and it can be used after being returned for repair. The amount of loss is difficult to estimate at this time.</p>
<p>Planning for Prevention and Aftermath</p>
<p>As for the cause of the accident, the company in this city has not yet received detailed information. However, it is generally speculated that Yizhang County is located at the junction of Hunan and Guangdong, with high mountains and steep ridges, and the climate is prone to change, leading to accidents. For the safety of air travel, the company is dispatching personnel to investigate the details of the accident and planning to set up a weather reporting station at the junction of Hunan and Guangdong to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Normal Flights</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Corporation will not suspend the Ping-Yue route due to the accident, so it will continue to operate according to schedule. It is also reported that the company's general manager, Mr. Li Jingcong, took Plane No. 2 from Shanghai to Hubei yesterday morning for some important business. Whether he will continue to fly to Xinjiang to meet Sheng Shicai will be decided after arriving in Hubei.</p>

<p>Modifying Cabinet Design</p>
<p>The glass cabinets for displaying antiquities were designed pro bono by architect Mr. Li Jinpei and commissioned to be manufactured by the Dahua Iron Factory, totaling sixty-four units. Yesterday, the factory delivered a sample cabinet to the association, which was reviewed by the committee members and architect Li and slightly modified. The cost is 130 yuan per cabinet, and the contract was signed within days.</p>
<h3>Ordering of Foreign Rice to Stop Registration Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Association issued a circular to rice merchants yesterday, saying: We are writing to inform you that the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has issued an order stating that the ordering of foreign rice by rice merchants in this city is unrestricted, which not only leads to the outflow of money but also affects rural areas. This bureau believes that it is necessary to correct this. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for approval, it is also scheduled to stop registration on the 25th of this month.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Sends Chen Chunpu Abroad</h3>
<p>To Investigate the Actual Situation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Chen Has Arrived in Shanghai Awaiting Ship</p>
<p>National News Agency reports: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in order to understand the actual situation of overseas Chinese, has specially sent Mr. Chen Chunpu to Nanyang and Europe to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese, so as to provide a reference for improving the lives of overseas Chinese and providing relief. Mr. Chen has arrived in Shanghai and is awaiting ship to go abroad. Mr. Chen plans to go to the Nanyang Islands first, as the number of overseas Chinese there is the largest. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, the local industry and commerce have plummeted, making it extremely difficult for overseas Chinese to make a living. Mr. Chen plans to conduct a detailed investigation there. After completing the investigation in Nanyang, he will go to Europe, as several European countries have been excluding overseas Chinese. Mr. Chen plans to investigate this matter to provide a reference for government negotiations and assistance.</p>
<h3>The Thirty-Sixth Group of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Depeng and Twelve Others</p>
<p>The thirty-sixth group of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, Zhou Depeng, Zhou Bangyong, Zheng Deming, Zheng Shangsong, Chen Defei, Chen Zhenglian, Zhou Chengkai, Yang Yongrui, Zhou Honghe, Pan Tingqin, Lin Liyan, (all from Wenzhou), and twelve others arrived in Shanghai by Japanese mail ship Asama Maru at 6:00 PM yesterday. The ship docked at Huishan Pier. After disembarking, the overseas Chinese went to Lao Gongxin, Xin Gongxin, Yuelai, and other three hotels to stay. Among them, there was also one overseas Chinese from Fujian (name unknown) who stayed temporarily at Fuxing Hotel on Gongping Road. According to Pan Tingqin, who spoke to a reporter from the Industrial Association, he opened a Chinese restaurant in Toyoumi Village, Sanbu County, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. He has always been law-abiding and has not engaged in any illegal activities. However, the Japanese are fierce and treat him as an enemy, expelling him unreasonably. Moreover, before being expelled, all his property was confiscated and sold by the local police station, and he was detained in the Chiba Prefectural Office for more than a month. It is difficult to describe the suffering. After hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent investigator Hou Can to express condolences and set the cost at five yuan per person.</p>
<h3>Workers at British-Owned Ewo (Old Jardine) Mill Announce Strike</h3>
<p>Reason: Opposition to the Factory's Reduction of Wages</p>
<p>Petition to the Party and Government, Making Five Demands</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu employs more than 5,000 male and female workers. It has been in operation for nearly 40 years, and its business has always been prosperous. In 1930, when the yarn market declined, the factory announced a wage reduction and switched to a three-day shift. All workers expressed their acceptance in order to implement labor-management cooperation. Later, the factory canceled the rice subsidy, and the workers did not object either. Until recently, everything was still peaceful. However, on February 1st of this year, the factory suddenly announced a wage cut. All workers believe that they only work ten days a month, and their wages are difficult to maintain their lives. If they are cut again, it is tantamount to putting the workers in a desperate situation. They sent representatives to the factory to demand the restoration of their original wages, but the factory refused and ordered Indian police to drive the workers out. The workers were indignant and announced a general strike the morning before.</p>
<p>Petition for Assistance After announcing the strike, the workers prepared a document yesterday morning and sent representatives to the Party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to petition, presenting the details of the labor unrest and requesting assistance. Each of the agencies sent representatives to receive them separately, promising to investigate together and find a way to mediate. They also instructed the workers to maintain order and wait patiently for a solution.</p>
<p>Five Demands After announcing the strike, all the workers of the factory put forward five demands, which are recorded as follows: (1) Restore full-day and night work, (2) Restore original wages, (3) All wages from the date the factory expelled our workers to the date of resumption of work shall still be paid as usual, (4) The small silver received for the large silver shall be fully subsidized according to the market, or the small silver shall be accumulated to the integer amount, (5) Restore the original rice subsidy of 2.4 cents.</p>

<h3>Polish Government School Ship to Sail from Japan to Shanghai by the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>Sailing Entirely by Wind Power, Coming to China via the United States and Japan</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau and Merchant Marine School Responsible for Hospitality</p>
<p>The Polish government school ship Dar Pomorza, carrying 41 crew members and professors and 66 students, is making a round-the-world voyage to practice maritime navigation and train various commercial navigation skills. It is expected to sail from Japan to Shanghai by the end of next month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country has consulted with the Ministry of Communications and decided that when the ship arrives in Shanghai, the China Merchants Bureau and the Wusong Merchant Marine School will be responsible for the reception. The previous reports were slightly inaccurate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Round the World</p>
<p>The Polish school ship Dar Pomorza is not a warship but a school ship used by the Polish government to train commercial ship personnel. The ship is equipped with three large sails and the hull is made of pure steel, similar to our country's large sailing ships, with a very beautiful style. The ship sails entirely by wind power, although it is equipped with the latest type of motor, but it is agreed that it will not be used unless absolutely necessary. The ship is 78.5 meters long, 13.5 meters wide, has a draft of 6.85 meters, and a load of 1,566 tons. It carries 41 crew members and professors and 66 students. It departed from the Polish port of Gdynia on September 16th of last year, along the Baltic Sea, Santo Domingo, Curacao Islands, Panama Canal, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki in Japan, Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, Singapore and Batavia in the Nanyang Islands, Saint Helena in South Africa, Azores Islands, and finally returned to Poland via Dover in England. The planned itinerary is expected to be completed around September 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Polish Embassy, the ship arrived in Honolulu in mid-January and is scheduled to arrive in Yokohama, Japan, in early February. It will then sail to Nagasaki for minor repairs and then proceed directly to Shanghai. Because it relies entirely on wind power, the voyage from Nagasaki to Shanghai will take about six or seven days. The ship will stay in Shanghai for several days and then sail south to Hong Kong. The China Merchants Bureau and the Wusong Merchant Marine School will be responsible for providing hospitality and sightseeing at that time. The Polish Chamber of Commerce in this city will also host various circles to visit the ship.</p>
<p>Historical Interest</p>
<p>The ship's history is quite interesting. The ship was manufactured in Germany in 1909 and used to train commercial ship personnel. After the European War, the ship was owned by France. In 1930, it was purchased back from France with donations from the people of the Polish province of Pomorze and donated to the Polish Naval Academy. Therefore, it was named Dar Pomorza to mark the anniversary.</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Exhibition</p>
<p>Poland has recently been working hard to expand its Far East trade. Its parliament has a proposal to add consulates in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Kobe, and Yokohama, and has decided to send the Polish cargo exhibition ship Darłowo to various countries in the Far East. The ship is full of various Polish products, which will be docked at various important ports for public exhibition. The ship will also depart from Gdynia and sail directly to Shanghai first, arriving around April 20th. It will stay briefly and then sail to Japan and various parts of the Nanyang.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approved the Commerce Association's Interpretation of Stamp Duty Doubts on Receipts</h3>

<h3>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Requests the Ministry of Communications to Quickly Add Radio Stations in Shantou, Xiamen, and Fujian-Guangdong</h3>
<p>Piracy and robbery of merchant ships occur frequently. Various sea vessels are actively carrying out anti-piracy arrangements. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's current sea vessels are all equipped with wireless telegraphs, and the ship's equipment is being improved successively. However, recently, considering that the robbed ships were all controlled and driven by pirates to the Dapeng Bay area to escape, special precautions should be taken on the Nanyang route. The chief of the wireless telegraph station of the ship, Mr. Fang Ziwei, recently proposed, in order to improve the convenience and speed of wireless telegraph alarm transmission on each sea vessel, so as to effectively protect each ship from piracy, that ports along the South China coast, such as Shantou, Xiamen, Guangdong, and Fujian, have not been equipped with wireless telegraph stations, making it difficult for ships in distress to send telegrams for help. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has formally submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that wireless telegraph stations be quickly added to the coastal ports of Shantou, Xiamen, Fujian, and Guangzhou, so that merchant ships sailing to various ports in South China can transmit telegrams at any time. The effect is not limited to sea vessels encountering piracy, which can be reported to the coastal radio stations, so that the pirates can be captured in one fell swoop, and rescue ships can be dispatched at any time, so that the pirates are deterred and dare not plot to rob again. Even ships that have an accident can use this to transmit messages, which is faster than assisting rescue, protecting sea safety, and maintaining life and property. The request has been issued by the Bureau, requesting the Ministry of Communications to quickly add stations.</p>
<h3>The Inland River Steamboat Industry Association Convened an Extraordinary General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Request Permission to Form an Inland River Shipping Cooperation Design Committee</p>
<p>The Inland River Steamboat Industry Association of this city believes that the specific plan for Chinese shipping cooperation approved by the Ministry of Communications last year only includes articles for inland port steamboats and does not include inland river steamboats.

The executive committee decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of members yesterday at 1 PM at the association's office on Suzhou Road.

(Resolution) Passed. (2) Should the draft of the industry regulations be approved? (Resolution) Passed. The meeting adjourned after discussing other matters.</p>

<h3>Workers' Petition Delegation from Shenxin No. 5 Factory in Shanghai Appeals for Relief</h3>
<p>Demanding the Factory's Resumption of Operations to Maintain Livelihoods</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill, located on Gaokou Bridge, Huade Road, employs more than 2,000 male and female workers. The business has been quite prosperous in the past. In recent years, due to sluggish yarn sales and expensive cotton, losses have been enormous, making it impossible to maintain operations. After the factory was shut down this Spring Festival, it was originally scheduled to resume operations on the 9th of this month. However, due to financial constraints and economic difficulties, it announced a formal shutdown on the 16th of this month. After the factory announced the shutdown, the livelihoods of more than 2,000 workers were affected. As a result, the workers panicked and, after a joint discussion, elected Zhang Kening, Hu Qingsheng, Hong Ji'an, Liu Xihou, Xia Anting, and 17 others to form a petition delegation. Yesterday, they appealed to Party and government agencies, requesting relief so that the factory could resume operations and maintain the workers' livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Business Conference Postponed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture recently convened a business meeting and invited experts in Anglo-American cooperative movements to lecture on cooperative issues. The meeting was originally scheduled to close yesterday (the 23rd). However, due to too many issues to be discussed, it could not be concluded as scheduled. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it to next week. Yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM, the department, in order to facilitate fellowship and provide reference for service personnel, also screened American marketing cooperation films in the bank's sixth-floor conference hall, totaling seven reels, divided into three types: cotton marketing cooperation, egg and chicken marketing cooperation, and livestock marketing cooperation.

<h3>Rice Merchants in North and South Shanghai Oppose Full Tax on Broken Rice</h3>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Association held a meeting to discuss the foreign rice issue. Some people advocated that the government levy a full tax on No. 3 Gongmi rice. (Note: The government stipulates that foreign rice imports with 55 or fewer broken grains per 100 grains are subject to a full tax of 3.4 yuan per bag, and those with 55 or more broken grains are subject to a half tax. No. 1 and No. 2 Gongmi rice are fully taxed, while No. 3 is fully taxed.) This was opposed by Chen Yuming, a member of the association, who pointed out that a portion of the rice merchants in North and South Shanghai believe that No. 3 rice is mostly sold in the interior to poor villagers. If the tax is increased, the poor villagers will find it even more difficult to afford a livelihood. Moreover, farmers in the countryside use taro and melon as food. They are afraid that the association will approve the tax increase. Therefore, they jointly requested Chen Yuming yesterday to vigorously prevent it in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers.</p>

<h3>Shen Wujie Sentenced to Imprisonment for Abusing Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Foster Daughter-in-Law, Meiying, Sent to a Reformatory</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association Reported to the Police Station</p>
<p>At around 4 PM on the 16th of this month, the China Child Welfare Association received a phone report that Shen Wujie, residing at 66 Pike Road, had beaten her three-year-old foster daughter-in-law, Meiying. The association immediately dispatched Secretary Zhao Jian to report to the New Gate Police Station. Together with the police, Shen Wujie was taken to the court, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is reported that Shen Wujie is from Yixing. Her paramour, Mr. Lin, adopted a son named Baobao (currently four years old) from his fellow villager, Ms. Lv Xue (currently 30 years old), two years ago. Last year, he bought a three-year-old girl named Meiying for 13 yuan to be his foster daughter-in-law. He treated the foster son well because Ms. Lv Xue lived nearby, but he beat and abused the foster daughter-in-law all day long. The case was reopened by the court on the 22nd of this month. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to Article 294 of the Criminal Law for injury. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial and summoned witnesses Li Yao and Lv Xue to testify. The forensic doctor verified that the child's head, face, and buttocks were severely injured, proving that she had been beaten many times with a large stick. Currently, she is receiving treatment at Guangren Hospital due to her serious injuries and cannot appear in court. Judge Liu questioned the witnesses, who all testified that the beating was true. Shen Wujie also confessed. She was sentenced to six months in prison. The foster son, Baobao, was returned to his biological mother. The foster daughter-in-law, Meiying, will be sent to the Reformatory after she recovers from her injuries. Shen Wujie also expressed her willingness to accept the sentence. The police then escorted her to the Caohejing Prison to serve her sentence.</p>
<h3>Yao Zhifu was Injured by a Mob Beating by the Son of the Foreman for Demanding Reinstatement</h3>
<p>Zou Deliang, a Ningbo foreman of the Xiangtai Timber Company, an English merchant on Yangshupu Road, was beaten by a mob of more than 20 people at 7:10 AM on September 7th of last year due to a dispute over bonuses with the workers. Suspects Sun Jiakang, Ye A'qiao, Ru Xiaoxiang, and Yao Yongyao were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. Due to insufficient evidence, they were declared innocent. Later, the company fired all of them. Subsequently, a civil lawsuit was filed. After Zhou recovered from his injuries, it was found that workers Ni A'ao and Cen Kaihua were also involved and were dismissed. After losing their jobs, they had no suitable work and were very poor. Recently, they requested the Social Affairs Bureau to allow them to be reinstated. According to reports, at 3:15 PM on the 13th of this month, the four workers, Ru, Yao, Cen, and Ni, went to the tobacco and paper shop opened by foreman Zou Deliang at No. 1439, across from the company, to demand reinstatement. Zou was not there, and they failed to negotiate with his son, Ji Chang. Many workers were invited to come and injured Ru's forehead and legs and Cen's back and buttocks with broken bowls and iron tools. Yao and Ni saw the situation was bad and took the opportunity to escape. The nearby Indian police arrived after hearing the alarm. The perpetrators fled in a hurry. The injured were sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The day before yesterday, the Yangshupu Police Station received a report that the instigators of the beating were actually Zou Jichang and his father's bodyguards, Ningbo natives Yu A'lai and Xu A'gao. The police chief sent Chinese and Western detectives to bring the three men into the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Gongbu Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan described the events, stating that Yu and Xu were also taken to the hospital by the plaintiff. The victims identified them as the perpetrators at the scene. When questioned, Zou Jichang confessed that he was upstairs at the time, heard the noise below, and the glass window was broken by someone. He immediately sounded the alarm. He did not order the beating. Yu and Xu claimed that they were playing in the Little World and the Shihui Port in the South City at the time and were not at the scene. They asked for an investigation. The victims, Ru Xiaoxiang and Cen Kaihua, who had slightly recovered from their injuries, appeared in court and stated that they, Yao Yongyao, and Ni A'ao, had gone there to demand reinstatement. Zou Jichang first told them to get out quickly, then said that it was okay to beat them to death, he would take responsibility. The person who started the fight was a stranger named Zhang Qilin. They mistakenly identified Yao Yongyao and Ni A'ao at the hospital. They said that Zou Jichang was the one who instigated the beating. When questioned, Zou firmly denied it. Judge Wu Zehan ordered Zou, Yu, and Xu, the three defendants, to each pay a bail of 300 yuan. The sentence will be announced at a later date.

<p>On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, around 4 p.m., Li Pengfei, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road police station, received information that Zhang Xiushan from Jiangbei and Tang Shanming from Liyang were in Room 13 of the Donghe Hotel on Fuzhou Road, producing and selling counterfeit banknotes for profit. An informant was sent to purchase some, and the information proved to be true. Subsequently, he, along with a secret detective from the Western district, arrested Zhang and Tang one after the other. They confiscated nine ten-yuan notes from the Bank of China, six five-yuan notes from the Ningbo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and one five-yuan note from Tianjin Jiaotong Bank, and brought them to the police station. They were then handed over to the First Special District Court. In their testimony, they claimed that the counterfeit notes came from Li Zifang, a Pudong native living in the Wengjia Lane on Jinjiafang Road in the Chinese district, and that they only earned a small commission. The police station dispatched detectives to arrest Li, but he could not be found. Following instructions to await the verdict, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the Third Criminal Court yesterday, sentencing Zhang Xiushan to three years of imprisonment and Tang Shanming to five years. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment will be deducted from the prison sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The counterfeit notes were confiscated.</p>

<h3>The National Government Chairman to Issue Declaration at the Opening of Children's Year on April 4th</h3>
<p>Expressing the Government's Determination to Protect Children</p>
<p>A Request Submitted by the China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>News of the commencement of the National Children's Year on April 4th of this year has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers recently. A reporter has learned that Xu Jianping, the General Secretary of the China Child Welfare Association, submitted a request to Chairman Lin of the National Government yesterday, requesting that he issue a Chinese Children's Year declaration on the opening of Children's Year on April 4th to announce it to the entire country and promote it. The text of the request is as follows: "Requesting the Head of State to Issue a Declaration for the Holding of Children's Year to Announce it to the Entire Country to Promote It: This association, in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, in order to promote the well-being of children and to awaken national attention to child welfare, specifically requested your government to designate the twenty-third year of the Republic of China as Children's Year, so as to concentrate national efforts and improve the well-being of children. Due to the complexity of the preparatory procedures and other practical difficulties, your government decided that the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China would be Children's Year, commencing on April 4th. This association considers April 4th as Children's Day, and now also as the opening day of Children's Year, the significance of which is extremely important. Therefore, it plans to publish a 'Special Issue for the Opening of Children's Year and the Celebration of Children's Day' to express warm congratulations and to create a lasting memorial. Considering that the holding of Children's Year in our country was decided and ultimately the responsibility of your government, the U.S. government, when starting Children's Year on April 6, 1918, its president, Wilson, on behalf of the government, issued a Children's Year declaration. A total of 11 million women participated in the activities, which generated 17,000 committees. There was a warm and active response throughout the country. If there is no clear and explicit expression from the government for the holding of Children's Year in our country, how can it inspire the people to rise up and participate in various charitable works? Therefore, we venture to specially request the Chairman to write a 'Children's Year Declaration' to express the government's determination to protect children, to be announced throughout the country, known to every household, and the sound of which will spread, and the happiness of children will be boundless. All the reasons for requesting your government to issue a Children's Year declaration are written here to be submitted for review and implementation. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Xu Jianping, General Secretary of the China Child Welfare Association." In addition, the Special Issue for the Opening of Children's Year and the Celebration of Children's Day, prepared by the China Child Welfare Association, is currently being edited by Secretary Chen Zhengfan. Those invited to write commemorative essays for Children's Year are President Wang (Announcement to the People of the Whole Country on the Opening Day of Children's Year), Chairman Jiang (Children's Year and the New Life Movement), President Dai (My View on Children's Year), Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education (Announcement to Educators Nationwide), Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior (Announcement to Personnel of Child Welfare Organizations Nationwide), Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry (The Road for Chinese Children), Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance (The Significance of Children's Year), Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government (The Mission of Children's Year), Mayor Wu of Shanghai (Announcement to Parents Nationwide), Director Pan of the Education Bureau (Announcement to Children Nationwide), Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau (The New Society and New Children), Director Li of the Health Bureau (Talking about Children's Hygiene), Ms. Song Meiling (Announcement to Women Nationwide), Ms. Chen Bijun (Women and Children's Year), Ms. Ding Shujing (New Parents, New Children, New China), Ms. Wang Liming (The Happy Family), Cai Yuanpei (The New Significance of Child Welfare), Chu Minyi (Talking about Children's Sports), Luo Yunyan (Hopes for Children's Year), Tao Xingzhi (Children and Science), Chen Xuyuan (Children's Year and Promoting the National Goods Movement), Dong Renjian (Talking about Parental Education), Zheng Xiaocang (Talking about Parental Reading Materials), Chen Jicheng (Talking about Children's Education), Hu Shuyi (Talking about Children's Reading Materials), and Guan Jiong (Talking about Child Welfare).

<h3>Hua Zhongchu Lives Lavishly and Spends Money Like Water on the Way to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Two Prostitutes Not Accustomed to Western Food, Special Chinese Meals Prepared with Fifty Gold</p>
<p>Bathing in the Ship and Rewarding the Attendants Cost as Much as Fifty Gold</p>
<p>Composed Songs on the Way Back, Singing in Harmony with the Two Prostitutes Every Day</p>
<p>After Interrogation by the Court Yesterday, They Were Separately Detained</p>
<p>Hua Zhongchu, a staff member in charge of banknotes at the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank of Henan Road, colluded in fraud by mixing blank paper with banknotes. On the 13th of this month, the matter was exposed when the Jiufa Money Exchange in Hongkou exchanged banknotes at the bank. Hua immediately took two prostitutes from the Yinghong Brothel and secretly boarded the Coolidge ship to escape to Hong Kong. The other four people, Ding Chengfu, Pan Ruilin, Zhu Minggui, and Ding Hao, have been detained and sent to the First Special District Court, which ordered them to be detained. Meanwhile, the General Police Department specially dispatched detectives Zhang Mingde and Cai Liu to Hong Kong by plane on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, requesting British officials in Hong Kong to send police to the Coolidge ship upon arrival, to intercept Hua and the two prostitutes. On the 17th, they were brought back on the Jardine Matheson's Cheung Sang ship, arriving at 7 a.m. the day before yesterday, and taken back to the police station for separate detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, we know that Hua Zhongchu is from Wuxi and only twenty-two years old. Ding, Pan, Zhu, and Ding are also only in their early twenties. They all passed the bank's summer recruitment of trainees and were selected for employment. They were all assigned to the banknote vault to check banknotes. Although their salaries were small, ranging from six to ten yuan per month, their responsibilities were quite heavy. The bank's regulations stipulate that all money exchanges that regularly receive the bank's banknotes must have secret marks on the banknotes. For example, the banknotes received by Exchange A are marked with the character "(一)," and those received by Exchange B are marked with the character "(二)." If the number of "(一)" banknotes received by the bank accumulates to a considerable amount, Exchange A is notified to prepare funds to redeem them. The banknotes that Hua and others mixed with blank paper were those issued to money exchanges and gradually received back. If they did not notify the original account to redeem them according to custom, the matter would not have been exposed. The bank only checks the number of banknote bundles during each inventory check, but not the contents of the bundles. On the 13th of this month, the Jiuru Money Exchange went to the bank to redeem 16,000 yuan in banknotes. At that time, Hua was not in the bank, and other staff members who had not participated in the fraudulent activity unknowingly paid the Jiuru Exchange employees with bundles of banknotes containing ninety-nine blank sheets for every hundred banknotes. Thus, the scam was uncovered. Upon hearing the news, Hua decided to flee far away. Knowing that the Coolidge ship would leave Shanghai that day, he went to the New Asia Hotel and bought two tickets to Hong Kong, intending to escape with the second woman from the Yinghong Brothel. This prostitute was from the same hometown as Hua, was twenty-eight years old, and her real name was Yan Caizhen. She had just fallen in love with Hua around November of last year. As for the third woman from the Yinghong Brothel, she was from Xinghua, was thirty-five years old, and her real name was Wu Zhihua. She had made a blood oath with Ding Chengfu. This time, her escape with Hua was instigated by Ding, who also planned to follow after Hua left.</p>
<p>Hua, having purchased the tickets, feared being discovered easily, so he discarded the two tickets and went to the New Asia Restaurant, ordering the waiters to buy two more tickets. He then went to the Huiluo Company to purchase clothing for use. In half an hour, excluding the cost of the two tickets, he spent as much as five or six hundred gold. Hua, considering Hong Kong to be a foreign country, immediately changed into a Western suit and ordered the New Asia waiters to transport his newly prepared luggage. He then took the two prostitutes to board the ship. Before departing, he rewarded the waiter who bought the tickets with forty gold and the porter who transported the luggage with twenty gold. His extravagant spending and wasteful behavior can be imagined. After the ship left Shanghai, both prostitutes were not accustomed to Western food. Hua ordered the ship to prepare special Chinese meals, paying another fifty yuan for meals. Bathing on the ship also cost another fifty yuan. This kind of extravagance is rare. On the 15th, the ship arrived in Hong Kong. Hua thought he had escaped the net, but unexpectedly, just as he was rejoicing, police detectives sent by Hong Kong officials boarded the ship and arrested Hua and the two prostitutes together. Just as he landed, Hua unexpectedly jumped into the sea. Fortunately, both Western detectives were skilled swimmers and immediately jumped into the sea after him, rescuing Hua. Although he did not die in the belly of a fish, he had absorbed a lot of seawater. Therefore, when Hong Kong officials handed Hua and others over to Detective Zhang to escort them back to Shanghai by ship, they feared that Hua would stage another suicide attempt, so they ordered the Western detectives to wear swimming suits to assist in the escort, and were extremely cautious when boarding the ship. This shows the importance that the Hong Kong authorities attached to the case. Yesterday morning, Detective Zhang and others escorted</p>
<p>Hua and the two prostitutes to the First Special District Court. Someone asked Detective Zhang about Hua's behavior on the ship. According to him, Hua's attitude was very calm and his mood was particularly cheerful after being escorted onto the ship. Although he seemed to be forcing a smile, he was still optimistic. Hua spent the days on the ship talking intimately with the two prostitutes or singing and dancing together. Hua had received a considerable education and was quite intelligent. He composed a song in the style of "Goodbye, Paris." The lyrics are: "Goodbye, Lily, goodbye, Lily, I love your warm heart, I am not abandoned by criminals, I cannot bear to be separated, with your true heart, how can I not listen to your advice, goodbye, goodbye, at this moment, I cannot take you, I cannot leave you, goodbye, goodbye, Lily, goodbye, Lily, you and I are husband and wife in adversity, inseparable, I hope your heart will never change, wait for me to meet you when I am released from prison, goodbye, goodbye, at this moment, I cannot take you,</p>
<p>I cannot leave you, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye Lily." He would sing this song several times a day on the ship with the two prostitutes. His voice was clear and melodious. After singing, Hua would quench his thirst with cocoa tea. The third woman from Yinghong liked coffee, while the second woman had to have fried yellow croaker for every meal, and so on. After a while, Judge Qian Hongye ordered Hua and others to be brought to the court for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, gave an account of the situation, stating that the crimes committed by Hua and Ding Chengfu and others were still under investigation, and requested that Hua be detained pending investigation. However, it was found that Ding Hao was not involved and should be released. Hua Zhongchu then testified that he had been an assistant clerk in the bank's cashier department for thirteen months. Initially, Zhu Minggui lost 200 yuan in gambling and could not make up for it. Pan Ruilin suggested misappropriating bank funds. Thus, whenever they needed money, they would take bank funds, and from then on, they would gamble at the</p>
<p>Huili Ball Park and the Greyhound Racing Track. By November of last year, they had misappropriated several thousand yuan. They then opened the Yangzi Hotel to discuss ways to make up for it. Pan still proposed using blank paper instead of banknotes and decided that if the amount used was too large, Hua would first flee to blame it on Hua alone. If Hua could not escape, he would take the opportunity to make gold standard transactions. If they made a profit, they would use the remaining funds to make up for it. In total, they replaced about 30,000 yuan with blank paper, lost more than 7,000 yuan in gambling, and borrowed 5,000 yuan, and so on. Next, the police lawyer stated that when Hua and others were arrested in Hong Kong, more than 26,800 yuan of stolen goods and banknotes from HSBC and other banks were found. Due to the inconvenience of carrying them, they were temporarily stored in the Hong Kong government office and will be remitted to Shanghai separately. It was found that Hua's original plan was to meet with Ding Chengfu in Hong Kong and go to Kowloon together, and then divide the spoils, and so on. Judge Qian then ordered Hua and the two prostitutes to be detained, and Ding Hao was released.</p>
<h3>The Ministry Orders Two Railways to Facilitate Passengers Getting on and off</h3>
<p>Trains Must Stop in the Middle of the Platform</p>
<p>The Two Railways Administration instructed the Traffic and Mechanical Departments, stating, "According to Order No. 1287 from the Ministry of Railways, it has been found that the passenger trains of the railway have recently been stopping at one end of the platform instead of near the awning in the middle of the platform to facilitate the watering of locomotives. This causes great inconvenience to passengers getting on and off when it rains or snows, which is not a convenient way for passengers. The stations should be instructed to ensure that trains stop at a suitable location in the middle of the platform when they stop at the station in the future, and should not stop at one end of the platform for the convenience of watering the locomotives. The locomotives should be supplied with coal and water after the train has been unloaded, so as not to hinder passengers getting on and off. You should comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>The Russian Doctor on the Northern Steamer Risks Desertion, The Story of His Experiences</h3>
<p>Saving Himself with a Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Russian doctor, named Tai Mi Duwei, on the Soviet Russian mail ship Northern Steamer, which carried Ambassador Yan Meilanfang and Ms. Hu Die to Vladivostok, because the situation residing in Soviet Russia was unbearable, risked deserting his post on the day the ship weighed anchor. He wandered the road for several hours, eventually rescued by a newspaper, and is currently staying in a hospital to recuperate from his over-shocked nerves. Mr. Tai told others about his experiences, saying, "I have decided not to return to Russia, because life there is worse than death. I have long cherished the desire to flee, but I have had no opportunity. When the Northern Steamer opened in Shanghai, I was appointed as the surgeon for this trip, and I felt that the time had come and could not be missed. Fortunately, my long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, which is really beyond my wildest dreams. I am not a member of the Communist Party, so I am closely monitored. This escape was extremely dangerous. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, I was allowed to go ashore for a short tour with the permission of the captain, but I was accompanied by a sailor, no less than an unofficial prisoner. After arriving at Nanjing Road, I thought about escaping. But then I changed my mind, thinking that it would be difficult to succeed at this time, so I reluctantly returned to the ship. Although disappointed, I did not lose heart. On the third day, I asked to go ashore again and was actually granted permission. I regarded Nanjing Road as the road to freedom, but even though I walked on it, I was still uneasy, knowing that the struggle for freedom had just begun and there were still many thorns ahead. I did not know anyone and could not speak English or Chinese. I did not dare to ask passers-by for directions, fearing that they were supporters of Soviet Russia. Later, I found an old Russian newspaper on the road and saw an advertisement for the Russian Association. I found its office and asked the clerk to be an exile from Russia. The people in the association said that I had to find two famous Russian expatriates in Shanghai as guarantors before I could register. So I was greatly disappointed again, because I did not know anyone when I first came to Shanghai, how could I find them? When I flipped through the newspaper again, salvation came again, because it contained the names of two former medical colleagues. I rushed to ask for their help, and they immediately agreed to guarantee me and sent me to the hospital to treat the shock I had suffered for several months."</p>

<h3>Judge in Jiande Bank Case Strictly Orders Submission of Account Books</h3>
<p>Chai Chuangui Severely Reprimanded, Extremely Frightened</p>
<p>Presented a Written Pledge in Court to Submit the Account Books by a Deadline</p>
<p>After the Jiande Bank went bankrupt, the bank's president, Chai Chuangui, and directors and supervisors Ou Jiancheng, Tu Kaizheng, Chen Xiweng, Ma Suizhi, Xie Keming, Yan Ziyu, Chai Yousheng, Zheng Huaigu, and Li Jingwei, were sued by Wei Haijiang and others for fraud and embezzlement. The case has been heard in the First Special District Court several times, and has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui continued the trial. Few of the defendants appeared in court. Pan Xiren, an accountant entrusted by the Jiande Bank to liquidate the assets, was summoned by the court to bring the relevant account books of the bank to court for review. However, Pan failed to appear in court and did not send the account books and other evidence to the court. Judge Liu stated that a special court was opened today to investigate the evidence, but Pan resisted. Judge Liu immediately instructed Chai Chuangui to notify accountant Pan by telephone to bring the account books to court within fifteen minutes. Chai then replied that he had sent an urgent telegram, but Pan was no longer in his office. Judge Liu was furious and sternly rebuked Chai, saying that the accountant had received a summons, but had failed to appear in court without reason, which was inappropriate. Furthermore, Chai had previously refused to submit the relevant account books as ordered by the court, repeatedly using excuses to delay the proceedings, clearly attempting to destroy evidence and other purposes, which was sufficient to constitute grounds for detention. Now, out of leniency, Chai was ordered to present a written pledge in court to submit all relevant account books for review within three days, starting next week. Chai heard the order and was extremely frightened, and immediately complied with the written pledge. The court then continued to interrogate Chai about the recruitment of Wei Haijiang as a shareholder and the deception of Wei into pledging his land deeds in exchange for a loan using the lure of a deputy manager position. Chai's testimony was generally the same as his previous statements. Then, witness Gu Wensheng testified that he had been an assistant manager of the Jiande Bank and was promoted to deputy manager two months before the bankruptcy. In October of last year, Chai ordered him to seek Wei Haijiang's consent to replace Deputy General Manager Ou Jiancheng, who had resigned, and to ask Wei to provide assistance in economic matters. He then spoke to Wei, who immediately agreed and personally handed the square deed for one hundred and ten acres to Chai, who mortgaged it to the Shanghai Bank for 60,000 yuan. Later, Wei went to the bank one day, but had nothing to do, so he did not come again. The bank's practice was to notify the industry of the seals of newly hired senior personnel, but this procedure was not followed for Wei. In June of last year, he was introduced to purchase shares at the behest of Chai Chuangui. As for whether Wei purchased new shares or transferred shares, he was still an assistant manager at the time and had no right to ask, so he did not know. He also did not know the bank's business situation at that time. However, Chai once told him that the bank had made a profit of more than 30,000 yuan in the last quarter, but he did not know whether it was true because he had not been able to check the accounts. Judge Liu then ordered the hearing to be adjourned to the afternoon of March 14th.</p>
<h3>Elevator Automatically Ascends and Descends</h3>
<p>Repairman Dies Tragically</p>
<p>At 10:40 a.m. yesterday morning, the elevator in the Yuanfang Foreign Company at No. 10, Lane 126, Sichuan Road, automatically ascended and descended while it was stopped because the elevator machine button was damaged. The company immediately notified the electrical department of the British-owned Xiangtai Foreign Company for repairs by telephone. After receiving the news, Xiangtai Foreign Company sent worker Cao Shengkun and his cousin to the scene. They tested the elevator to stop it in mid-air between the fourth and fifth floors, and then climbed onto the top of the elevator to sweep away the dust. Before long, the elevator suddenly and automatically rose straight to the top of the fifth floor. At this critical moment, Cao's younger cousin, who was short, saw the elevator rising and jumped off the top, escaping unscathed. Cao, who was tall, did not have time to jump down and was violently hit by the elevator against the ceiling of the roof, instantly crushed into a meat pie, with his brains bursting and blood and flesh flying everywhere. The scene was too horrible to bear. Later, the company urgently called the Central Police Department to send an ambulance to remove the body and transport it to the Philan Road morgue for examination. It is reported that the Yuanfang Foreign Company has decided to provide generous compensation to the worker for his death in the line of duty.</p>
<h3>After Appeal, Two Criminals in the Wang Bin Assassination Case Are Still Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Li Ziecai Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Between April and May of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Wang Bin, a supervisor of the investigation team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and Cao Qingcheng, a supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, both from Suzhou, were successively shot and killed by Communist thugs in front of the Gu'en Temple on Weilmeng Road and at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Chale Road in the French Concession. During the killing of Cao, Jin Shoupei, from Baoshan, was mistakenly killed due to a misidentification. After the case occurred, detectives from the French Concession apprehended the perpetrators Liu Guobao, from Sichuan, and Li Shiying, from Henan, and seized their guns. Later, their accomplice Li Ziecai, from Anhui, was also apprehended, and two guns were also seized. They were all sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and the French Police Department filed a public prosecution against them for endangering the Republic of China and premeditated murder. Liu Guobao and Li Shiying were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for endangering the Republic of China and sentenced to death for murder. Li Ziecai was sentenced to nineteen years of imprisonment for endangering the Republic of China and murder. Liu and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. Because there were still doubts in the case after review, the original judgment was revoked and the case was sent back to the Third Branch of the High Court for another trial. The Third Branch of the High Court has repeatedly held hearings to investigate evidence, and the collegiate panel has completed the trial and scheduled the pronouncement of the judgment. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the judgment was pronounced in the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Although the reasons for the judgment were changed, Liu Guobao and Li Shiying were still each sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment and death, and the death penalty was executed, with deprivation of public rights for life. Li Ziecai was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for endangering the Republic of China and twenty years of imprisonment for murder, with a combined sentence of life imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for life. After the verdict, the three criminals were returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse in the Hebang Canal on Pingding Road</h3>
<p>The Cause of Death is Still Unknown</p>
<p>Order for Forensic Autopsy</p>
<p>Around 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Chinese constable patrolling at No. 1143, Three Head Road, Yangshupu Police Station, discovered a male corpse in the Hebang Canal near Pingding Road, aged about thirty years old. He immediately notified the police station by telephone, and Central and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. They found that the deceased was buried half in the river, chest down, head east and feet west, with his feet crossed together, his arms tied behind his back, his mouth slightly open, his tongue protruding from his teeth, and a rope around his neck. The distance from Pingding Road was about one hundred and twenty yards, and the distance from the Huangpu River was one hundred and fifty yards. The detectives immediately devised a way to retrieve the corpse. After a brief examination by a doctor from the Public Works Department, the corpse was taken to the Philan Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, together with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the morgue to examine the body. They then ascended to the case table. The Western police chief reported the previous situation and stated that the deceased was likely strangled or killed by other means and then the body was moved to the location. According to the doctor from the Public Works Department, the corpse's head and other parts also had injuries, and the deceased had been dead for about three weeks. Now, in order to know the cause of death and exactly how long he had been dead, a request was made to autopsy the corpse to clarify the truth. Mr. Song reviewed the report and approved the request. It was then ordered that the cause of death of the unidentified deceased was still unknown and should be determined by a forensic autopsy.</p>
<h3>Capture of a Thief Leads to Discovery of Red Pill and Firearm Cache</h3>
<p>Multiple Additional Arrests Made</p>
<p>Numerous Previous Crimes Confirmed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 1:00 AM, Yu A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, along with Detectives Xie Guisheng and Wang Jiaju, apprehended a notorious thief named Xue Bao at the intersection of Hubei Road and Nanjing Road. Under interrogation, Xue revealed the location of his accomplices, who were hiding in room 510 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road. The detectives swiftly proceeded to the hotel and apprehended four individuals: Ma Amao, Yu Huating, Wu Linhai, and Chen Baobao. During questioning, Chen confessed to possessing a Mauser pistol, which was hidden in the Xiaoyao Courtyard brothel at number 6, Taiyuan Lane, on Avenue Edward VII. The detectives recovered the firearm at that location. Simultaneously, they apprehended three more accomplices—Ge Liansheng (aka Xiao Fusheng), Guan Zhengmao, and a woman named Ge Zhou—at number 316, Balizhao Road, in the French Concession. The premises turned out to be a red pill manufacturing operation. The detectives seized over 5,000 red pills, along with the equipment used to manufacture them, and brought everything back to the police station. Subsequently, based on the statements of the apprehended suspects, the detectives learned of a cache of firearms hidden at the residence of Wang Ruiting, number 7, Sanxing Lane, on Avenue Haig. Chief Detective Yu and his team proceeded to apprehend Wang but were unable to locate any firearms. It is known that Wang previously held the position of Director of the First District, Second Precinct, of the Shanghai Municipal Police and is currently serving as the Director of the Stamp Tax Bureau in Wuxi. The police station has learned that all of the individuals apprehended have a history of criminal activity, and investigations are currently underway. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:00 PM, the suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court with a request for temporary detention, which was approved by Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court. The case is scheduled for further review next Monday.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Death of a Young Woman by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wang Wenyuan, a tailor from Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, resident of number 13, Tianxian Lane, had a 23-year-old son named Zhang Lin, who worked at the Zhentai Goods Company near the Old Zhabei Bridge. Two years ago, Zhang Lin married a local woman surnamed Lin, aged 21. After the marriage, they remained childless, and their relationship was uneventful. Zhang Lin's work kept him away from home frequently, leaving Madam Lin feeling lonely and isolated. She often stared blankly into space, appearing to be in a daze. Recently, her behavior had changed drastically, and she had become prone to unpredictable fits of laughter and tears. The day before yesterday, her father-in-law, Wang Wenyuan, went out to work for a client, and her mother-in-law went to work in the fields. Only Madam Lin and her great-aunt-in-law, who was over eighty years old, were at home. Around 1:00 PM, Madam Lin went into the bedroom without a word. After a while, the elderly great-aunt, Chen, heard Madam Lin groaning in the bedroom and became alarmed. She went to check on her and found Madam Lin lying on her back on the bed, with her eyes tightly closed and unresponsive. In a panic, she immediately called for help. Neighbors gathered after hearing the cries and rushed Madam Lin to the Ji Qun Hospital in Gaoqiao Town. According to the doctor, Madam Lin had attempted suicide by consuming opium. However, due to the large amount of poison ingested and the delay in treatment, she could not be saved. She died around 4:00 PM that afternoon, and her body was returned to her home at number 13, Tianxian Lane, to await burial. The local police station was notified of the incident and, suspecting foul play, ordered officers to summon Wang Zhanglin, the deceased woman’s husband, for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, they instructed Xu Jingren, the local tithing head, to report the death to the District Court for an inquest. Afterward, Prosecutor Kong Xianglin summoned the tithing head for questioning but decided it was too late to conduct the inquest that day. He scheduled it for the following day (today) in Pudong and instructed the tithing head to be present.</p>

<h3>Arrest Made in Extortion Case Against Zikang Bank Manager</h3>
<p>Three Criminals Apprehended</p>
<p>He Zhongxiao, the Ningbo native manager of the Zikang Bank at number 114, Tianjin Road in this city, received threatening letters from an organization calling itself the "National Salvation Iron Blood Group" around December of last year (lunar calendar). The letters demanded 15,000 silver dollars. He ignored the six or seven letters that were delivered, and he did not report them to the police. On the 17th of this month, a bomb was thrown at the bank's window by criminals. It exploded, but the blast was weak and did not injure anyone. The bank reluctantly reported the incident to the General Police Station. Chief Detective Su Changsheng and his team investigated and determined that the bomb was made using an Ajinomoto can filled with explosives. They instructed the bank to report any further threatening letters immediately so that they could investigate. Sure enough, the bank received another letter from the criminals the next day, arranging for the payment to be made in front of the Tongxianhe Hotel, number 489, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. He immediately delivered the letter to the police station. Chief Detective Su ordered Detective Wang Bocheng to disguise himself as an old clerk of the bank and act as the representative. Chief Detective Su then led Detectives Li Yidong, Kang Zengxiang, Wu Chunrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Gao Zhen, and others, all in disguise. They arrived at the hotel around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and scattered to lie in wait. Soon after, a tall man in a Western suit arrived with another man in Chinese attire. They saw Detective Wang seated and immediately announced that the appointed time had arrived. Detective Wang realized that these two were the criminals and turned to go downstairs. The two men followed him downstairs. After walking a few steps, the two men moved ahead of Detective Wang and motioned for him to follow. As they approached Shanhaiguan Road, the two men noticed that they were being followed by a large number of people and realized that they were detectives. They immediately tried to escape, but the detectives rushed forward and apprehended them. They were taken back to the police station. The man in the Western suit was identified as Bao Zhifang, a Ningbo native, and the man in Chinese attire was identified as Zhang Fuyuan, from Henan. Bao confessed that they were responsible for the crime and that Zhang had initiated the plan. The bomb was manufactured by Chen Jin, a Shaoxing native living at number 60, Lane 66, Xinzha Road. All three were present when the bomb was thrown. The detectives went to Chen's home to arrest him, but he was not there. They then went to Bao's home at number 64, Yongji Lane, where they found Chen. He was arrested, and a seal of the "National Salvation Iron Blood Group" was found in the room. All three were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the situation and prosecuted them under Article 1, Section 2, of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. However, he requested that the hearing be postponed for a week as the police station had not yet completed its investigation. All three defendants confessed to the crime, and their confessions matched the police station's account. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confessions and ordered that the case be postponed for a week for further hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Shen Baixian's Letter Requests Funds for Disaster Relief to Dredge Zhu Jiashan River</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Drought Relief Committee for Various Provinces received a telegram from Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, requesting funds to help dredge the Zhu Jiashan River in Jiangpu, which is a vital transportation route for seven counties and is crucial for commerce, agriculture, shipping, and irrigation. Due to years of neglect, it has become severely silted up. The committee is asked to allocate funds to assist with the project due to financial difficulties. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully to President Kong of the Shanghai Drought Relief Committee for Various Provinces, having read your esteemed letter, I have taken note of all its contents. The Zhu Jiashan River in Jiangpu is indeed a vital transportation route for seven counties and is crucial for commerce, agriculture, shipping, and irrigation. Due to years of neglect, it has become severely silted up. Dredging it is urgently needed. The County Magistrate reported that the stretch from Zhangjiabao to Sancha River will require an estimated 120,000 silver dollars in labor costs. The province has already allocated 15,000 dollars from the county's work relief funds. We are working hard to raise the remaining amount. The county is facing severe financial difficulties, which is indeed the case. In response to your letter, I am sending this telegram to earnestly request as much assistance as possible, so that this major project can be undertaken to provide significant relief. I am deeply grateful. Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction."</p>
<h3>Public Should Pay Attention to Preventing Smallpox</h3>
<p>The health situation within the International Settlement continued to be good last month. Smallpox, which is typically prevalent during this season, was barely seen. If the public can make full use of vaccination facilities, smallpox may be eradicated or at least greatly reduced. The concern is that when the disease does not break out, people become complacent and do not seek vaccination as a preventive measure. Last month, the Municipal Council's Health Department vaccinated 18,360 people, a decrease of about 10,000 from December.</p>
<p>The foot-and-mouth disease among cattle has decreased at the end of the month. Measures to protect the dairy farms are still being implemented in neighboring areas. One farm’s cattle had been infected, but it has been properly handled. Foot-and-mouth disease is not easily transmitted to humans. However, because it affects the supply of milk, it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The Health Department is considering methods to address the issue of spitting in cinemas. This bad habit is not unique to cinemas. It has become a major problem in public entertainment venues. Prevention must be implemented through education and other methods. There were 1,425 reported births among Chinese residents, and the death rate was 11.98 per thousand. The most common causes of death were old age, tuberculosis, nervous system diseases, lung diseases, and heart diseases.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Officer of Hongkou Police Station Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper *Shanghai Daily*, at 9:10 PM on the 22nd, Kiyosuke Matsuda, a 27-year-old Japanese patrol officer working at the Hongkou Road Station of the Municipal Council, committed suicide with a handgun at the home of his friend Nobuo Sakai, number 55, Minde Lane, North Sichuan Road. The bullet went through his right neck. Sakai took him to Fumin Hospital for emergency treatment, but the injury was severe, and there was little hope of survival. Soon after, his parents and sister arrived after hearing the news. Several suicide notes were found in his pocket, stating something along the lines of, "I have been unhappy for half my life. From now on, I can only escape the sea of suffering through misfortune." It is said that the cause of the incident was likely related to family matters.</p>
<p>According to the *Daily News*, Matsuda, the young police officer who attempted suicide, was scheduled to work the second shift that day, which started at 7:00 PM. He had already decided to commit suicide when he went from Fair Road to the Hongkou Station. At 8:00 PM, he went to the home of his colleague, Nobuo Sakai, in a drunken state. Sakai had a close relationship with Matsuda and, knowing that he was on duty, urged him to go home early. While Sakai was putting on his clothes, Matsuda took out a handgun from his waist and shot himself. According to his relatives and friends, Matsuda's pessimism was entirely due to family and financial problems.</p>
<h3>Yang Yinpu Talks About Inflation</h3>
<p>Lecture Given at Silk Industry Bank the Night Before Last</p>
<p>In order to increase the interest of employees in studying economics and general social issues, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank regularly holds academic lectures, inviting academic experts to speak on important issues. The bank recognized that inflation is currently a central economic issue. Therefore, at the regular meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they invited the well-known economics expert Mr. Yang Yinpu to give a lecture on the topic of inflation. More than a hundred people attended. The bank's secretary and head of the General Affairs Department, Mr. Mao Zhenchu, presided over the meeting. After the chairman gave an introduction, Mr. Yang began his lecture. He first described the main meaning of inflation, which is an economic policy that uses increasing the quantity of currency as a means to suppress the value of money, raise prices, and achieve other economic goals. Next, he described the three main types of inflation: (A) based on coins, which can be divided into (1) increasing the material of coins to mint more standard coins, (2) minting auxiliary coins according to the face value of coins, (3) reducing the purity of the coin and devaluing its actual price, so that the reduced purity can be used to mint more coins, which is the so-called devaluation widely practiced in various countries, (4) expanding the base of the standard currency, such as using both gold and silver, etc.; (B) based on banknotes, which can be divided into (1) increasing the amount of cash reserves to increase the amount of issuance, (2) reducing the reserve ratio, so that the reduced amount can be used to issue more banknotes, (3) the government orders the suspension of cash redemption, and the bank issues banknotes without restriction; (C) based on credit, that is, banks and money houses increase lending and issue more bills, all of which can cause inflation. He then described the impact of inflation, which is a mixture of advantages and disadvantages. On the beneficial side, it can increase purchasing power, raise prices, increase consumption, revitalize all industries, reduce unemployment, and improve foreign trade. On the detrimental side, if there is no plan or control, and unlimited inflation is carried out in chaos, it can rapidly lead to extreme economic panic and even collapse, which cannot be remedied. Finally, he discussed whether inflation is needed in our country and what its advantages and disadvantages are, all of which were thorough and concise, showing true insight. Mr. Yang spoke for two hours and finished at 8:00 PM, when the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>U.S. Ning Case Indemnity Funds to Aid Jinling University</h3>
<p>Totaling 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>—Approved by the Central Political Conference—</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. Ning Case indemnity, due to the voluntary relinquishment by five U.S. organizations in China, former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Finance Minister Song Ziwen initially proposed in 1928 to donate the funds to well-known U.S. universities to establish Chinese cultural lectureships. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minister to the U.S. Shi Zhaoji negotiated to change the donation to Jinling University. The Ministry of Finance successively allocated salt tax treasury bonds and customs tax treasury bonds with a face value of 100,000 yuan each in the 20th year and the 22nd year. Now, according to the temporary budget for subsidies for the 22nd year prepared by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Political Conference has approved and verified the full amount. The National Government has now issued orders to follow suit.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Preparations for the Sino-German Society</h3>
<p>Since the proposal to organize the Sino-German Society was made by members of the Association of Students Returned from Germany and Austria at a meeting last month, Zong Baihua, Xie Shoukang, Jiang Fucong, Teng Gu, Xie Shuying, Guo Youshou, Qiu Changkang, Xu Daolin, Zhang Pingqun, and other nine people were elected as preparatory members. Subsequently, the first preparatory meeting was held at the beginning of the month. Zong Baihua was elected to draft the preamble, and Jiang Fucong and Guo Youshou were elected to draft the articles of association. They actively proceeded. Now, on the 22nd of this month (Friday), the second preparatory meeting was held at the Association of Students Returned from Germany and Austria in Pingcang Lane, Nanjing. Zong Baihua, Teng Gu, Jiang Fucong, Guo Youshou, Xie Shuying, Zhang Pingqun, and others attended. Jiang Fucong reported on the progress of the contact with the person in charge of the Sino-German Cultural Association in Beiping, stating that the Cultural Association has been established for nearly three years. Its German name is Dentschland-Institut, which should be translated as German Institute or Society, rather than Sino-German Cultural Association, and it has not been formally approved and registered by the Central Party Department and the Ministry of Education. Therefore, it is willing to cooperate with the Sino-German Society. The Chinese name will be the Sino-German Cultural Association, and the German name will be the Sino-German Society, which is in preparation. The proposed Chinesi　ch-Deustscher　Knlturverband will be located in Nanjing, with a branch in Beiping. The preparatory meeting adopted this principle and passed the preamble and the draft articles of association. They will be translated into German to invite German and Austrian figures to participate in the launch. It is planned to hold the inaugural meeting in early March.</p>

<h3>Promoting Simplified Characters</h3>
<p>The First Set of Simplified Characters Contains 300 Characters</p>
<p>200 Initiators from All Walks of Life Sign</p>
<p>Although Chinese characters have various advantages, the excessive number of strokes and the inconsistency between handwriting and printed forms are major obstacles to public education. In recent years, some people across the country have advocated reducing the strokes of Chinese characters to facilitate teaching. Recently, people in the cultural circles have jointly studied this issue for a long time. The first set of simplified characters has recently been published, with 200 initiators from all walks of life signing. More than a dozen cultural institutions and publications have decided to adopt it. The origin of promoting simplified characters and the first set of characters are copied below.</p>
<p>Origin of Promoting Simplified Characters</p>
<p>We often have many convenient characters that everyone writes by hand, but they are not printed that way in books. To recognize a character, you must recognize more than two forms, which is very inconvenient. Now, we advocate using "handwritten characters" in printing to save readers the trouble of memorizing several character forms, making characters easier to recognize, easier to write, and more accessible to the public. This proposal has been raised by someone before, but they did not actually do it, so it did not have much impact. Now we have decided to cast "handwritten characters" into copper molds and pour out lead characters for printing books. First, we selected 300 commonly used handwritten characters as the first set of characters to be promoted, and then gradually add more until "handwritten characters" are the same as printed forms. We hope that cultural people who value simplicity will agree with our proposal and adopt this vocabulary as much as possible. Initiators: Ding Shujing, Wan Dihe, Wan Jiabao, Xiao Mo, Wang Renlu, Feng Zikai, Fang Guangtao, Ba Jin, Wang Ji, Wang Duqing, Wang Tefu, Wang Guoxiu, Wang Jicong, Wang Pingnan, Fang Jinglue, Ye Shengtao, Zhu Ziqing, Ye Fang, Zuo Xuzhi, Bai Wei, Ye Heshi, Zhu Shaoqing, Zhu Wenshu, Ren Baige, Liu Yanling, Liu Tingfang, Liu Liangmo, Lao She, Yu Zhijie, Shen Zicheng, Li Gongpu, Wu Wenqi, Shen Xiling, Shen Tilan, Shen Zhiyuan, Xu Zelin, Li Changzhi, Mi Xing, Ai Siqi, Shen Ziji, Shen Qiyu, Li Nanxiang, Li Guanfang, Lu Gaoyi, Wu Langxi, Wu Zuxiang, Wu Yan, Wu Qingyou, Su Xuelin, Ai Hancun, Fang Liande, Li Yiyan, Yu Nanqiu, Wu Jingheng, Wu Lianming, Shen Duanxian, Li Huiying, Du Gangbai, Ai Wu, Xin Shuzhi, Wang Jingzhi, Wu Hanyun, Liu Xunyu, Bo Han, Wang Fuquan, Wu Yaozong, Shao Lizhi, Meng Shi, Zhou Muzhai, Zhou Yutong, Lin Handa, Lin Benqiao, Dong Ping, Jin Zhaozhi, Jin Zhonghua, Ouyang Shan, Zhou Bodi, Zhou Boxun, Shao Zonghan, Luo Shuhe, A Ying, Tai Shuangqiu, Zhou Yueran, Zheng Nong, Jin Yan, Hu Zhongchi, Hu Feng, Hong Shen, Yao Shaohua, Jiang Qi, Liu Shi, Fan Yang, Hu Yuzhi, Yu Dafu, Xia Gaizun, Ni Wenzhou, Zhu Baiying, Xi Ru, Zhu Folang, Ma Zongrong, Cao Ming, Tang Tao, Ma Xingye, Sun Lianggong, Sun Shiyi, Gao Mengdan, Ma Guoliang, Ma Guoying, Xi Dichen, Gao Tielang, Xu Weinan, Xu Maoyong, Guo Yicen, Zhang Naiqi, Cao Xiaoduan, Chen Zizhan, Zhang Tianyi, Cao Liwu, Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Zhongshi, Lu Yiyan, Zhang Xiaomei, Zhang Liangfu, Chen Junye, Chen Kecheng, Chen Junhan, Xu Xingzhi, Guo Moruo, Cao Liang, Chen Zhidao, Guo Yiqing, Chen Wangdao, Zhang Menglin, 　Bin He, Bi Yuncheng, Xu Jie, Xu Danian, Xu Qinwen, Cao Juren, Chen Weijiang, Chen Duanzhi, Lu Deyin, Chen Zhangsheng, Zhang Xichen, Lu Xizhi, Shu Qian, Zhang Yaoxiang, Huang Shi, Gu Junyi, Fu Donghua, Feng Hefa, Huang Sufeng, Shu Xincheng, Huang Yuan, Cheng Yansheng, Gu Shusen, Hei Ying, Jin Yi, Zang Kejia, Yang Qingtian, Yang Dongchun, Lu Minxing, Ge Qiao, Ge Suicheng, Yang Chao, Yang Sao, Yang Jiyun, Zhao Yiping, Xiong Changyi, Zhao Jiabi, Kuai Simao, Zhao Jingshen, Guan Cuizhen, Cai Yuanpei, Pan Gongbi, Pan Shi, Fan Zhongyun, Zheng Junli, Zheng Boqi, Cai Xitao, Lu Yan, Zheng Zhenduo, Li Liewen, Jiang Jingsan, Deng Yuzhi, Le Sibing, Jiang Bi, Cai Muhui, Li Jinming, Jiang Jingfu, Lu Jiye, Mu Ouchu, Xie Liuyi, Zhong Tianxin, Xie Fuya, Zhong Shaoqin, Nie Gannu, Wei Mengke, Tan Youliu.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Re-Approves Fuxing Primary and Secondary School Textbooks</h3>

In addition, one English teacher is needed, limited to those who can teach advanced English composition. Interested applicants can send their resumes and experience directly to the Vocational Introduction Department of the Society at 381 Poplar Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Lectures on Shanghai's School Education (6)</h3>
<p>All of which comes from our ordinary people. However, this indemnity was returned, and it's to the credit of the foreigners' clear heads that they were willing to return this money to you to run education. They returned this indemnity to us to run education, as if to say, you suffered in the past because you were uneducated and lacked knowledge. But what about us when America and others returned the indemnity to us to run education? If we take it to run "primary education," so that every family's children aged six to twelve have the opportunity and are forced to attend these primary schools, without paying fees, this is the fairest thing. Because the money was taken from 470 million citizens, and now the foreigners are returning it to us, we should also return the money to every citizen. If we run primary schools and allow everyone's children to study without paying, how fair would that be! Compared to sending a few "favored sons" abroad as students, and running "higher education," it always feels more essential. Like the children of families without money today, they don't even need to dream of going to primary school. What's most ridiculous is that some people are even using this money to do favors, sending actors abroad. It's truly absurd and "laughable."</p>
<p>All of us intellectuals, especially the primary school teachers across the country, should awaken society and make everyone pay attention to "universal education." As for "specialized education," in this stage, we may as well wait until our "primary education" and "adult education" are universal before seeking development. If we work hard towards this "universal education," I believe that Chinese education can complete its initial mission. If we can do this, the country will have a turning point, have hope, and have its future. If we continue to muddle along, dare not speak out on this issue, and allow a small number of people to control, divide, and monopolize it, using it solely for the superficial "higher education" cause, while allowing primary schools to close due to lack of funds and ignoring them, then we will not only lose the mission we have for education, but also lose the essence of education. If we let it have no solution this year, no solution next year, and continue to drift along, then what are we "primary education" people doing? Moreover, for Shanghai in particular, it's even stranger. The "Boxer Indemnity" was allocated from customs duties. Shanghai's "Jianghai Customs" is one of the largest customs in the country. I'm afraid Shanghai citizens bear a lot of customs duties, certainly more than other places, not less than other places. But if you ask what Shanghai citizens enjoy from the returned Boxer Indemnity, what have we gotten back? Therefore, when talking about "Shanghai's education," I believe that simply adding a little money here and a little money there this year is not a fundamental solution. We must think big and then plan how to use this money in a pragmatic way. Then, Shanghai's education can truly achieve the goal of "universal education" in just two or three years. Everyone must understand that this matter is the foundation of education in all provinces and counties. I once said that I am not advocating only "universal education" and not "higher education," but that we should first focus on "universal education" before we can talk about "higher education." This is a very simple principle and an unavoidable common rule. For example, the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, which is 22 stories high, has a roof at the top and a foundation at the bottom. I ask, when construction began on this building, did they build the roof first, or did they lay the foundation first? If they did indeed build the roof first, then I willingly retract what I said today. If they had to lay the foundation first, then my speech may not be nonsense. Please pay attention to everyone. Finally, I solemnly declare again that doing "universal education" first and then seeking development of "specialized education" is the only way to run Chinese education. (End)</p>

<h3>Italy and Japan Compete to Host the 12th World Olympic Games</h3>
<p>Rome Proposes an Exchange Condition</p>
<p>(Havas Du, Paris, 22nd) Regarding the location of the 1940 Olympic Games, the French Olympic Committee, due to conflicting information, formally inquired with the Italian Committee about Italy's position. According to the response from Mr. Stedras, the Secretary of the Pan-Fascist Party and Chairman of the Italian Committee, Italy still maintains its request for the 1940 Olympic Games to be held in Rome. However, since that year is the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan, Japan requests that it be held in Tokyo. In order to show generosity, Italy is prepared to make concessions, but with one absolute condition: the International Committee should agree that the 1944 Olympic Games will be allowed to be held in Rome.</p>
<p>Japanese House of Representatives Passes Funding</p>
<p>(Japan Union News, Tokyo, 23rd) The House of Representatives meeting was held at 12:00 PM today. Hatoyama Ichiro and eight others urgently proposed that the government should provide funding to assist in the 12th International Summer Olympic Games being held in Tokyo. Committee Chairman Tanaka Shiro said that the recommendation committee has already approved the case. Then, Tagida Makiyama Kozo took the stage to explain the benefits of the Summer Olympic Games for the health of people around the world, and said that since the end of the 19th century, the Summer Olympic Games held in various parts of Europe have never been held in the Far East. Asian nations sincerely believe that this is a matter of regret. This conference is not only a sports conference, but also a world conference for various artistic competitions. However, the expenses required for this conference to be held in Tokyo should be allocated by the government for active assistance. Then, Coast Guard, Ando Pitto, Lu Tian, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education, and others waited to express their approval. After a result of adoption, the case was unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Japanese Propaganda: American Assistance</p>
<p>(Japan Union News, Tokyo, 23rd) Regarding the issue of holding the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, the Japanese government previously ordered Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiro to request the active intervention of the US government. US Ambassador to Japan Grew asked Vice Minister Shigemitsu this morning to express that the United States will spare no effort to provide active assistance in the China issue.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the West League Football Association's Zilin Cup Semifinals, Youyou vs. Jinan, began at 3:00 PM at the Hongkou Park First Stadium. As a result, Youyou won with a score of five to one, securing the final spot.</p>
<p>At the Beginning of the Game</p>
<p>Youyou immediately took the offensive, especially with the forwards being the most active. After about fifteen minutes, Shen Shiqi launched a solo effort from the wing, advancing straight in. Reaching a suitable position, with a sudden sound, the ball was released like an arrow from a bow. The Jinan goalkeeper was caught off guard, and the ball entered from the lower left corner, opening the scoring. Five minutes later, Zhou Shaowen, with the help of Xi Qiaosheng, scored again. In the first half, Youyou led by two goals.</p>
<p>After the Break</p>
<p>Youyou continued their efforts, with Zhou Shaowen passing the ball appropriately, allowing Xi Qiaosheng to drive straight in and return with a goal. Soon after, Xi skillfully and familiarly scored the fourth goal. Once, Jinan's inner defender Chen Chunxi illegally bumped into someone in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Mao Hongfa successfully kicked it. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Jinan tried its best to counterattack, with imposing momentum. The Youyou goal was full of enemy traces. Amidst the melee, Jinan's Huang Jianghua obtained the ball and shot powerfully, reclaiming a goal. As a result, the score was five to one, with Youyou winning. Hopefully, they will work harder in the finals and win the championship.</p>

<h3>Rampant Speculation in Gold</h3>
<p>Creating a Low Price of $894</p>
<p>Resulting in a Drastic Fall to $12.9</p>
<p>The gold market has been unsettled for days. Once selling starts, it is difficult to stop. It is always difficult to increase capital. The trading floor is empty, and sellers can move easily. Speculators take advantage of the situation to push out gold. Banks are struggling to cope, and the exchange rate is weak. This has created a new low price of $894. It was reported that early in the morning, news came from abroad that the American market was closed, the British bank was slightly reduced, and the price of silver in Monterrey also fell. Exchange rates decreased. London raw gold rose seven and a half pence. People’s minds were still calm. Off-site ready transactions opened at $0.78, which was a slight increase compared to the previous closing price. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the British rate flat and the American rate down. The customs gold unit rose by eight li. The standard price of gold was $940.30, which had little impact. On the contrary, the price fell back. The morning opened with a low bid, but after opening, buyers were still eager, and the price rose. Banks were pushing and pulling. The HSBC listing did not move, and the situation was peaceful. Although it rose slightly later, it fell slightly downstream because Sassoon was selling shillings. The Central Bank was still buying shillings and opened spot slightly, which was still able to support the price. The silver balance was announced and did not move. At this time, few transactions were made, and the market was mediocre. However, HSBC, McCallum, Sassoon, and others vigorously sold shillings. There were also rumors in the market that a Sino-British loan had been established. Under the encouragement of selling, the price gradually fell. Speculators were actively selling American dollars and banks were struggling to cope. Once the $900 mark was broken, the exchange rate became strangely hard. Many parties immediately began to shake. Everyone started to liquidate. Despite some struggles, supply exceeded demand, and it was easier to fall than to rise. The price fell steadily. There were also rumors that the United Kingdom and the United States were cooperating to stabilize silver prices, creating a new low price of $894. After closing, the market was tired, and the swap premium fell back to around $7. The half-day market was extremely mediocre. People's minds were always relaxed. After the rising trend ended, the falling trend became stronger, which was unexpected. Buyers had no choice but to rush to liquidate, leading to this situation. Now, the half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at $906.80, which was $1.20 lower than the previous closing price. Heng Yu and Fu Yu pushed up to $8.50. Qian Changxiang, Heng Chang, Yong Yongli, Da Dechang, and others sold to $7.50. Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas bought April US dollars at $8.75. Although Heng Yu and Tai Chang entered, Yongli and Da Dechang still sold to $7.30. Fu Yu and Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to take orders, rising to around $8. However, Mitsui came out with April US dollars at $8.75, predicting that the HSBC listing would not move. At this time, it was still hovering. Then, Jin Feng, Yong Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, and others entered orders, rising to $8.90. Da Da Chang, Da Heng Chang, Yong Sheng, Da Heng Xing, and others successively sold orders.

Fu Xing, Yong Heng Yu, Yongli, Yuan Mao Yong, Wan Chang Yong, Da Feng, and others sold again to $2. Dalian and Da Fa Yong still accepted, but due to the hardening of the exchange rate, McCallum sold May British gold at $125, Yu Qing, Yong Qing Yu, Yongli Chang, Da Zhao Feng Chang, Da Dechang, Fu Xing, Yong Fu Yu, and others sold off one after another. The $900 mark was finally broken, and April US dollars at $125 were difficult to fill, falling further to $898.50. Fu Chang and Da Fa Yong took advantage of the low price to enter to $9.80. McCallum sold May shillings at $1875, Heng Yu, Fu Sheng, Yong Hong Xing, Zhen Tai, Da Chang Xiang, and others sold again to $7.10. Qian Changxiang, Hui Xiang, Yongli Chang, Da Da Fa Yong, although they entered to $9, Yuan Yi, Fu Yu, Fu Xing, Yong Ding Kang, Qing Yu, Da Cheng, and others sold orders, falling again to $6.30. Although Heng Yu and Yi Feng Yong entered to $7.30, the market was depressed. Da Fa Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Da Lian Bang, Zhen Tai, and Da Cheng liquidated their positions, falling to $4.30. Qian Changxiang, Qing Fa Yong, Yuan Yi Da Lian Bang, and others maintained, rising to $5.80. Fu Sheng Yong, Da Dechang, and Fu Xing Yong continued to sell orders, falling to $4. Wan Xing and Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to enter orders, and the noon closing was $895.10. After closing, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Yi Bing Xing, Da Kang, Heng Yu, Yi Feng Yong, Hong Xing, and others sold off one after another, falling to within $2. Da Fa Yong, Yu Qing Yong, Da Lian Bang, and others vigorously maintained, and finally rose to above $3.50. It was found that the highest price in the half-day was $908.90, and the lowest price was $894, a difference of $14.90. As a result, it fell drastically by $12.90 compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price rose to $940.30 due to the Central Bank's standard gold price listing, which was about $45 more than the closing price, and about $17 less than the previous closing price. The registered price for March was $884, and for April it was $895. The morning supplementary water was $876. The spot gold price was the same as the futures price, still $906.80. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were about $2.50 more. The Central Bank opened 105 spot orders at a price of $900.50, which was reportedly sold by Fu Chang.

Heng Yu posted to Run Chang Yu for seven orders at the same price. There seemed to be a lack of long positions in the market, and the trend was quite weak.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was chaotic. In summary, Wan Xing, Da Fa Yong, Heng Yu, Tong Tai Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, Tong Yi, Yuan Mao Yong, Shunli, Yuan Sheng Yong, Shun Mao, Yi Cheng, and others were on the buying side. Zhao Feng Chang, Da Dechang, Fu Xing Yong, Hui Xiang, Fu An, Fu Yu, Yong Feng, Da Chang Xiang, Yu Qing Yong, Zhong Kang, Hong Xing, Xiang He, Jia Tai, and others were on the selling side.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Distant Month Flour Declines Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw relatively calm trading in all months after opening in the morning. The price of foreign wheat was based on Chicago's inactivity and Canada's being around four points. After opening prices were quoted, each month saw prices fluctuate with little movement. The current month was stable because delivery was near and factories had already withdrawn most of their chips through the brokerages. Distant months saw inactive trading, and the market presented stability. The situation changed drastically when the afternoon session opened, with distant months seeing a sudden decline because factories continued to set the price of Australian wheat for one ship at only four yuan, seven jiao, five fen, and a half. Consequently, factories freely released large volumes and market prices dropped sharply by two or three fen. Continuing orders for foreign wheat are increasingly setting prices lower, so instability in the future may be difficult to avoid. The spot market in the current month saw relative stability due to limited inventory, dropping only one fen. March fell two fen, April fell two fen and seven li and a half, May fell three fen, June fell three fen and two li and a half, and July fell three fen.</p>
<p>Future Wheat Affected by Foreign Wheat Pricing</p>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market saw relatively calm trading in all months after the morning and afternoon sessions opened. The foreign wheat situation showed no activity in Chicago, and Canada was only doing four points. After opening prices were quoted, the current month, being the last day of trading, saw both buyers and sellers settling their positions. Thus, the morning opening price was one jiao and nine fen, and the afternoon closing price was eight jiao and eight fen, showing a stable trend. Distant months saw a stable market in the morning, but the afternoon saw news of continued foreign wheat orders, leading to a softer market sentiment. Observing this situation, further softening is expected in the future. As a result, the current month fell two fen, and March fell three fen. The spot wheat market remains stable. News reported Shandong Guide wheat at three yuan, nine jiao, two fen and three li; Bengbu wheat at three yuan, nine jiao; Huangqiao wheat at three yuan, nine jiao, and one fen; Yaowan wheat at three yuan, eight jiao, seven fen, and eight li; and Haizhou wheat at three yuan, nine jiao. Shen Da acquired four thousand yuan's worth, and Fuxin acquired two thousand yuan's worth.</p>
<p>Foreign Early Rice Opening Prices Soften</p>
<p>Jiujiang Traders Have Trial Purchase News</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw domestic traders temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach after continuous processing. The market had thick inventories and continuous sources, and futures trading also had tacit agreements, leading to softened sentiment. Merchants all sought to unload their holdings, so morning opening prices were immediately soft, lower by five fen to one jiao compared to the previous market. It was not until the afternoon, when Jiujiang traders arrived in the market to make purchases, that the market stabilized. The whole day saw the opening of 7,000 bags of Saigon rice and 1,500 bags of Siamese rice. Besides a small amount of trial purchases by Jiujiang, the rest was distributed by local traders.</p>
<p>Early native rice has seen sluggish sales due to high prices for several days, and market sentiment has long been depressed. Local merchants have been paying attention to Zhongguan foreign rice, further hindering its sales. Yesterday, Nanjing purchased 100 bags of machine oil rice, domestic traders purchased 140 bags of machine red rice, and Weijie purchased 250 bags of brown rice, all with prices declining by five fen.</p>
<p>Heshia Rice Arrives in Torrents, Prices Fall Again</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various merchant groups suddenly increased, totaling over fifty. (Goods totaled nearly ten thousand dan.) However, both retail and wholesale sales continued to be sluggish, causing the overall situation to weaken and the market to show a downward trend. Therefore, prices for thick japonica rice fell by half a jiao, and late rice depreciated by one or two jiao. The Yinyuan market also softened. Only Bianyuan rice saw little change due to the firm market in the lock area.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the sources from Heshia were quite plentiful, totaling over forty. Few people inquired about the goods on the market. Although there was some trading, it was very limited. The market price for white japonica rice decreased by about one jiao, and thin rice with high quality was weak, with medium grades falling by nearly one jiao. Other varieties all showed a weak trend. The destination for merchant pointed rice was limited, and its price did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Wheat Bran from Foreign Mills Sells Sluggishly</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat bran market saw a slight weakening because sales from foreign mills were not smooth. Although brokers were peddling the bran, foreign wheat paid little attention. It was only heard that future deliveries for March and April were under negotiation, and large transactions might occur in the future. As for the current asking price for wheat bran, it decreased by two and a half fen yesterday, opening at two yuan, seven jiao, and two and a half fen.</p>
<p>Guang Traders' Soybean Sales Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, driven by active sales in various markets, soybean prices continued to rise. Among the buyers, Guang traders were the most active. Yesterday, they purchased eighteen or nineteen cars of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans, priced at four yuan, three jiao and half to two jiao and seven fen. They also acquired two cars of Kaiyuan soybeans, priced at four yuan and five jiao; one car of Fanjiatun soybeans, also priced at four yuan and five jiao. Factories purchased over six hundred bags of Tancheng soybeans, priced at three yuan and nine jiao and half; four cars of Bengbu soybeans, priced at three yuan, seven jiao and three and a half fen; two cars of Yingzhou soybeans, priced at three yuan, eight jiao and three and a half fen; and two cars of Guide soybeans, priced at three yuan and nine jiao. Local traders purchased over two thousand bags of Hankou fresh soybeans, priced from three yuan, six jiao and eight fen to five jiao and half; domestic traders acquired over three hundred bags of Hankou late soybeans, priced at three yuan, six jiao and two fen.</p>

<h3>"Thinking" and "Doing"</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Someone said: "The English do without talking, the Germans talk after doing, the Japanese talk and then do, and the Chinese talk without doing." Children! Have you heard this? Do you believe that Chinese people talk without doing? You will undoubtedly agree after reading the facts below.</p>
<p>I recall when I was in elementary school three or four years ago, every time we encountered a commemoration or sports event, we would always distribute leaflets, post slogans, and hold flags, running and shouting in the streets: "Everyone save the country! Everyone save the country!" These were very enthusiastic slogans, but they gradually faded, and now? They are no longer heard at all. Furthermore, some people advocate that defending against foreign invaders should be done this way and that way, and saving the country should be done in such and such ways, speaking eloquently. These are indeed excellent methods for saving the country, but afterwards, who actually does them?</p>
<p>Dear children! We must know that for any task, we must first think, then act according to the planned strategy. Thinking and doing must absolutely not be separated. Otherwise, thinking becomes empty daydreaming, and doing becomes wasted effort. After several failures, who wouldn't be discouraged? Therefore, I hope you remember well: "We must use our hands to do, not use our mouths to talk."</p>
<h3>Young Inventors of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children, have you seen any news lately that is worth our respect and admiration when you flip through the newspaper? If you haven't seen it, I will tell you now:</p>
<p>"The capital of Soviet Russia, Moscow, held the All-Union Children's Mechanical Engineering Manufacturing Exhibition. There were two thousand children's inventions on display. For example, Lenin Gradskaya Kveta, only fifteen years old, invented an electric gas stove. Among the child inventors, the Ilyushin brothers from Tula are the most famous. One of the younger brothers, eleven years old, has already invented an automatic street light switch. His older brother, twelve years old, invented an electric film drying machine. Others, like Ramyev of Bashkiria, fifteen years old, invented a wireless radio train."</p>
<p>After reading this news, I felt twelve parts admiration on one hand and twelve parts shame on the other.</p>
<p>I admire that children of such young age are already able to invent scientific instruments and contribute to society.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to think that in our country, not only are there no such children who can invent such instruments, but even most adults are unable to invent them. Perhaps only 1% can, and even then, it's not invention but merely modification.</p>
<p>Children! Work hard! The world today is not the same as the world of the past! Quickly pour as much useful scientific knowledge into your minds as possible! All subjects in school, such as arithmetic, physics, and chemistry, must be studied with one hundred and twenty percent effort. After you have learned them, you will be able to stand firm in society in the future and not be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Instant Musical Instrument</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Little brothers and sisters. Today I want to introduce a very simple and interesting musical instrument. This instrument can be made instantly by anyone, and the sound is even more accurate than that of a wooden zither. Please try it out immediately: use eight identical and equal-height glass cups, placed side by side on a spring, (cups one inch apart, first fill the first cup on the right to nine-tenths full with clean water, the second cup to eight-tenths full, the third cup to seven-tenths full, the fourth cup to eight-tenths full, the fifth cup to five-tenths full, the sixth cup to four-tenths full, the seventh cup to three-tenths full, the eighth cup to two-tenths full, that is, from the first cup to the eighth cup, gradually reduce the amount of water.) Then, gently tap the edge of the cup with a lead law or chopsticks, then, it will change into 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,i, eight tones. The first cup on the right, because it is filled with nine-tenths of water, has a higher vibration frequency, so it emits a high tone i. The first cup on the left (that is, the eighth cup counting from right to left) emits the lowest tone because it is filled with the least amount of water. If the sound is inaccurate, the amount of water should be increased or decreased, and it can always be aligned with the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,i, eight tones. If you want to add higher notes 2,3 or lower notes 5,6,7, etc., add a few more cups on both ends. If you arrange two rows of cups and tap cups with the same tone with both hands at the same time, the sound is the same as playing an organ. Therefore, this instant musical instrument can be made instantly anytime, anywhere, and it doesn't cost money or effort, which is really very convenient. However, be careful when tapping, and don't tap too hard, so as not to break the glass cup.</p>
<h3>Children's Song</h3>
<p>— Zeng Rui</p>
<p>Children! Everyone forward!</p>
<p>Be number one, everyone strive to be first.</p>
<p>Victory is of course joyful, but defeat should also be accepted with pleasure.</p>
<p>Children, everyone forward!</p>
<p>Children! Everyone together!</p>
<p>The future masters, we will be!</p>
<p>The glory of the motherland, we will enhance!</p>
<p>Children! Everyone together!</p>
<h3>Lazy Birds</h3>
<p>— Dan Yun</p>
<p>Summer, the weather is very warm, the earth is full of green trees, and hundreds of flowers are blooming, opening beautiful flowers. Many lazy birds, in groups, happily fly in the sky, they sing songs, and they don't worry about the lack of food at all, because the earth is like a big warehouse, full of things they want to eat, allowing them to choose at will, without needing to put in any effort. Some diligent and thrifty birds are busy building nests and storing food, but they laugh at them, saying:</p>
<p>"Fools, what are you busy with in such beautiful and happy times?"</p>
<p>Soon, winter came, the trees lost all their leaves, the flowers withered, the weather was very cold, the northwest wind roared, the ponds were covered with ice, and the silvery white snow covered the world. Those lazy birds were shivering from the cold, they no longer sang joyful songs, but only wailed, as if saying:</p>
<p>"The weather is too cold, we are going to freeze, we are going to starve to death."</p>
<p>Those diligent and thrifty birds, however, were sitting in warm nests, eating the delicious food they had stored in the summer, they chirped, also as if saying:</p>
<p>"Fortunately, we worked hard in the summer to build our nests and store our food, otherwise we would have frozen and starved to death at this time, how could we still be so happy?"</p>
<p>Before long, those lazy birds had frozen to death on the white snow.</p>

<p>Correction We received a letter from Mr. Ma Shaoqing, stating that in the previous issue of this publication, the article "Puen Jia Lai" contained an error regarding the period of Mr. Pu's death. The actual time was after the Marseille tragedy last year. The author mistakenly recorded it. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture "The Force of Objects"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>— Action and Reaction —</p>
<p>When two objects push or pull each other, two forces will definitely occur. For example, when we throw a ball against a wall, there is a force. Of course, the wall also exerts a force back on the ball. The former force of throwing is called action in physics; the latter force exerted by the wall is called reaction. These two forces can be more clearly demonstrated when rowing a boat. The rower pushes the water with the oars, and the water exerts an equal force to push the oars back. Therefore, when rowing, one strokes and then stops. When stopping, the oar must be lifted out of the water to reduce the force of the water pushing the oar back on the boat. This way, the boat will move forward. Otherwise, the reaction force will be on the oar, pushing the oar in, and the boat will not move.</p>
<p>These two forces of objects, expressed in certain movements, are sometimes not very obvious. For example, when we jump high, we exert force on the ground to jump up. This is the action. However, when the body jumps up, everyone thinks that this is still the force used by the high jumper. In fact, this is completely wrong. The force used by the high jumper is only up to the point of landing. Afterwards, the force of the body moving upwards is the reaction force of the ground. When I jump rope, I also use this kind of reaction force from the ground (Figure 1), so I don't feel very tired. However, we cannot clearly observe this force, so we ignore it.</p>
<p>Let's look at Figure 2. Why can pushing the table with both hands also push the chair away? Clearly, this is also due to the reaction force. Because the force of the hand is applied to the table, the table generates a reaction force to push the hand. The hand constantly applies force, so the reaction force is reflected on the chair, pushing the chair away. In Figure 3, if the firework is made with a central axis of wire so that it can rotate, when the sparks come out, we can see that the rotation of the firework is opposite to the direction of the sparks. The swing in Figure 4 is the same proof. The experiment in Figure 5 is even more interesting. After you have weighed your body on the scale, suddenly raise both hands. At this time, the weight displayed by the scale will immediately increase. What is the reason for this? This is also due to the reaction force. Because when our hands are raised high, the center of gravity of the body moves upward, and its reaction forces the body to press down, therefore, the weight on the scale suddenly increases.</p>
<p>Children, when an object receives a force, a reaction force will definitely occur. Their relationship is also like the body and its shadow, which cannot be separated for even a moment!</p>
<h3>Why Does Freezing Break Bottles?</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>When the thermometer reaches below freezing, it will freeze. Why does water freeze? The reason is: below freezing, water will change from a liquid to a solid, and this change is a physical change of water:</p>
<p>We know that all objects expand when heated and contract when cooled. This is true for metals, and it is also true for the mercury in thermometers. However, when water freezes into ice, it not only does not contract, but expands. Precisely because of this, the water inside the bottle, after solidifying into ice, is broken by the expansion.</p>
<p>Children: These common theories, without someone explaining them, will leave you knowing the facts but not the reasons behind them for your entire lives. Things like freezing and breaking bottles will be a big joke and a big mystery!</p>
<h3>Mickey Mouse Pushing a Cart</h3>
<p>— Chong</p>
<p>Children! Doesn't your father often take you to see movies? When watching movies, before the main feature, isn't there a funny and interesting Mickey Mouse cartoon? The Mickey Mouse now is the same one you see in the movies.</p>
<p>Tool materials: a pair of scissors, a pencil, a writing brush, an inkstone, ink, an eraser each, a sheet of cardboard (must be thick) or an old leather shoe box can also be used as a substitute. A large sheet of white paper, paste, iron wire (one foot long, must be thick,) or copper wire can also be used as a substitute.</p>
<p>After finding the above tools and materials, then start making it. When making it, be careful. First cut out the thick cardboard according to A, B, C, D, and E. Then paste the white paper on it, and then use a writing brush to paint each part according to the diagram. A must be cut into four pieces to make four wheels. B must be cut into one piece to make Mickey Mouse's feet. C must be cut into two pieces to make the outer surface on both sides. D must be cut into three pieces and pasted on the inside of the two pieces of C. E must also be cut into three pieces and pasted on the inside of Mickey Mouse's inside of the two pieces of C. After the above procedures are completed, then make the four wheels, and thread the iron wire (or copper wire) through the four sides of the car body. Then insert (B), which is Mickey Mouse's feet, inside the (F) hole of Mickey Mouse. After assembling it in the same way, then thread the yarn (or twine) through the front of the car body, and you can use it to pull the cart. Because when the cart rotates, Mickey Mouse's feet will also rotate with it. It looks like he is walking? Because of this reason, it seems like he is pushing the cart. (Figure G)</p>
<h3>Jump Rope</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Jump rope is a way to keep warm in winter. I think: all you children! Must know how to do it, so why do I need to talk about it? This thing, though ordinary and simple, is also very valuable. It can improve our health and train our muscles, so it is necessary to introduce its theory and method.</p>
<p>Why does jump rope make us healthy? You need to know that it can vibrate our internal organs, giving them appropriate stimulation so that their function does not stagnate. If you do this every day, intensifying their work, the waste in the body will be discharged as much as possible, and the digestive function will be increased again, then how can our body not be healthy? At the same time, the muscles can also be strengthened, especially the muscles in the legs. Not only can it make them developed, but also practice their endurance. People who cannot jump rope often feel tired after only jumping a few times. But people who are used to jumping can jump at least dozens or hundreds of times each time, which shows that their muscle endurance is strong. It will also be easier to walk long distances without feeling leg soreness!</p>
<p>There are single-foot and double-foot jumping methods. Double-foot jumping is when both feet are raised together, jumping off the ground, allowing the rope to just pass under the feet. If you jump low, the rope can be slower. Conversely, it can be faster. However, the rope only needs to touch a small part of the ground. If a large section of rope drags on the ground, it will hinder the jumping speed, so it is best to just let it pass over the head and feet. After you are quite familiar with it, you can move to single-foot jumping. Just lift your foot higher forward or bend it deeper backward. This is more beneficial to the muscles of the legs, and the chest should also be pushed out to be hygienic.</p>
<p>Children! You have understood the theory and method of jump rope, so why not try it this winter!</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (7)</h3>
<p>— Qing Xin</p>
<p>They obtained all the jewels they could, and we left that place and came to the shore, boarding a general ship.</p>
<p>From there we came to the island of Lohah, where a kind of tree grew that supplied us with camphor. These trees were very large, and the branches were very thick, and a hundred people could comfortably rest under the shade of the trees. On this island I saw a very large beast. On its nose was a horn, called a rhinoceros.</p>
<p>In this place, I bought several more packages of goods, plus all my jewels, thinking of doing some business in the various places we passed on our way back.</p>
<p>We only stayed for a short time and went to other islands all the way, and finally I arrived in Beersalah very happily, and then set off for Baghdad from there.</p>
<p>I had a great fortune, and I gave it to the poor. With the money left over, I decided to live a quiet life at home.</p>
<p>Sinbad's Third Voyage</p>
<p>At that time, I was in my prime, so I soon felt that life in Baghdad was too lazy for me. I no longer thought of danger, so I bought goods, boarded a ship, and set off from Beersalah again.</p>
<p>We entered several ports, and at each place, I made a good deal of business. One day, when we were far out at sea, a great storm came, and the ship lost its way. The storm raged for several days, and finally we were blown to a strange island, where we were busy mooring in the harbor, otherwise our ship would have been lost.</p>
<p>Our captain didn't like this place. He told us that this place was inhabited by savages, whose skin was covered with thick red hair. He said that if these people came aboard, we should not fight, but immediately surrender, otherwise it would be even more unfavorable to us.</p>
<p>He said: "If we kill one dwarf, then the rest of the dwarves will immediately attack us and will never let us go."</p>
<p>These words made us very worried and full of terror. Before long, we saw that what he said was true. A group of dwarves, mostly like beasts and not like humans, swam to the ship together.</p>
<p>When they swam to the side of the ship, they spoke to us, but the language they spoke was unknown to us.</p>

<p>Women's Realm</p>
<h3>Nora in China</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>Ibsen's "Nora" stirred up the minds of Chinese people and broke through some of the orthodox defense lines during the May Fourth era. It was loved and imitated by the young men and women of the time, which is already a historical relic.</p>
<p>However, "Nora" in China, like other reform affairs, is being attacked by counter-currents and returning backwards. Last spring, someone put forward the wonderful theory that Nora should endure humiliation, repent, and return to her old home properly. This is clear evidence.</p>
<p>In this current era, where Meng Jiangnu's resurrection is praised, widows remarrying is rejected, and concubines committing suicide is praised, "Nora" returning to the stage is naturally a shocking thunderbolt in the smog.</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai reported that Ms. Wang Guangzhen, a teacher at Xingzhongmen Elementary School in Nanjing, was fired for playing "Nora," and the others who played supporting roles were also punished one after another. This interesting play was performed in Dalu Village or some island, which would not be surprising. Unfortunately, it came from Nanjing, the new capital of new China, which is too regrettable. Fortunately, the literary and drama circles of Nanjing, and even a certain vice minister who was confused in political affairs, stood up to voice their grievances, which proves that the new China has not been completely covered by ancient ashes.</p>
<p>It is just that the public opinion's grievance believes that Ms. Wang Guangzhen and others were sacrificed for art, and they launched a punitive expedition in order to maintain art.</p>
<p>However, in essence, this is not a question of artists being destroyed, but a question of society adding chains to the women's world. So this is not a personal insult to Wang Guangzhen, but a question of the entire women's world being trampled on. In this vortex of counter-currents, women who do not obediently hide at home and be playthings, but want to show their faces and run outwards, run to the stage, and run to the struggle line of society will naturally be considered by the orthodox gentlemen and their puppets—such as the headmaster of a certain elementary school—as worthy of severe punishment! However, darkness is a great contrast to light. People in the darkness are more eager for light than those in the half-light. The resistance of those who are severely stimulated will also be more powerful! In the absence of pessimism, a small hope is born below:</p>
<p>'The Chinese Noras who have already left, and the Noras who have not yet left, wake up! You should realize what era this is. You should no longer be "little squirrels, ignorant children..." for no reason, but should realize that you are human beings and should have a strong will, not be afraid of suffering, and concentrate your strength to fight against this heavy pressure. This is the Nora that the new China needs. "</p>
<h3>Women's Issues Lecture</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Section Two: How to Study Women's Issues</p>
<p>Some people believe that in China, there has been ample research on women's issues, and there is a sufficient amount of theory, leaving only practice. This is an exaggerated and biased view! Even if one were to say, "Only practice remains," then "theory" would still remain just as much! Why? Because theory divorced from practice is the empty talk of idealists. So-called "theory" can only grow and develop in practice!</p>
<p>In China, there is indeed no shortage of theories about women's issues, and research has been conducted for decades. However, past theories are products of the past practice of the women's movement. We must understand that practice develops along with the development of history; it constantly changes its direction. Therefore, past theories may not be fully suitable for current practice. Conversely, current practice can also produce new theories that are adapted to reality!</p>
<p>Clearly, many current women's movement participants still hold views on women's issues from the May Fourth Movement era. That is, they still dream of achieving complete equality between women and men in society under the existing conditions, and they are confident that this is possible. They believe that even under the status quo, if women can obtain the right to vote, the right to education, the right to employment, etc., it will not be difficult to stand shoulder to shoulder with men in society. This view cannot but be a deceptive fallacy. Since the May Fourth Movement, we have experienced the cruel Great Revolution of 1926-27, and now we are experiencing the terrible crisis of the so-called restoration movement engulfing our women. In this era of transformation, we can clearly see that the rights given to women by a male-centered society are like beautiful but inedible apples in a painting.</p>
<p>The Chinese women's movement underwent a fundamental transformation after the Great Revolution of 1927. Many progressive women's movement participants have long abandoned narrow feminism or equal rights feminism and regard women's issues as part of social issues. Furthermore, they seek to solve women's issues through the transformation of the entire society. This is a noteworthy change. However, research on the theory of this aspect is very lacking. Among the many books on women's issues circulating in the market, the most worthy of recommendation are only Bebel's "Woman and Socialism" and Ooms' "Lectures on Women's Issues"... and other kinds of readers. Although there are some more valuable essays on women's issues, they can only describe one aspect of women's issues and do not present a complete and unified account. From this perspective, research on women's issues in China has entered a new stage, and research on the theory of this new stage is undoubtedly still very necessary!</p>
<p>Research on women's issues, like research on all other social issues, must apply the method of materialist dialectics to gain a correct understanding. Because only it can clarify the essence of things and the process of their generation and development. At the same time, we must observe women's issues from the standpoint of historical materialism, because only in this way can we correctly understand the living conditions of women in various eras and societies, as well as the causes and consequences of women's oppression by men.</p>
<p>The scope of research on women's issues is very broad. In addition to general historical and realistic issues, it is also necessary to explore the biology of both sexes. Historically, people who study women's issues often encounter two types of opponents who are difficult to explain. One is the phenomenalists, who, like the ancient Greek philosophers who regarded slaves as naturally inferior, view the task of domestic slavery that women have been forced to bear under male domination for thousands of years as an "innate duty" that should be the case, and want to give a theoretical basis for male domination. The second is the naturalists, who, from the standpoint of biology and even physiology, explain the origin of women's inferior status. Like the phenomenalists, they regard the physiological phenomena of women being domesticated and weakened under male domination for thousands of years as the characteristics of the inherently weak, and rationalize women's inferior status in an attempt to perpetuate the male-centered society. But these "theories" will ultimately expose their true colors under the light of historical materialists!</p>
<p>Here, the scope I want to discuss is very broad. I will start with the biological observation of gender issues, talk about the living conditions of women in various eras and societies before and after history, and then give a brief introduction and critique of the women's movements and their thoughts in major modern countries. Finally, I will discuss the current trends of the Chinese women's movement as a conclusion. However, this discussion encounters two unavoidable obstacles. The first is that the space of this lecture is limited and cannot fully develop the collected data. The second is that because this lecture is a weekly publication, for the convenience of readers, each section of the article must maintain independent value, which may impair the unified system of the entire article. In addition to these two difficulties, there is also the speaker's own technical problem in the lecture, that is, the speaker himself cannot write popular articles to make the lecture accessible. All this must be stated here, and please forgive the readers!</p>
<h3>What We Should Strive For More</h3>
<p>— Lian Rui</p>
<p>In theory, many people now acknowledge that men and women should receive the same treatment in sexual liberation, and many people also advocate striving to put this principle into practice. However, as soon as they encounter the facts, whether they are new people or old people, they will show feudal consciousness.</p>
<p>For example, no matter how dissatisfied people are with a man's sexual morality, if he is knowledgeable and intelligent, they still allow him to be active in society. If it is a woman, no matter how profound her knowledge, how great her talent, how fervent her dedication and self-sacrifice, as long as there is a blemish in her sexual relationships that can be nitpicked, people will drag her down from the altar where she has been placed for thirty days, and push her into the eighteenth level of hell. It's as if a woman, once she loses her chastity or virginity, is no longer a human being!</p>
<p>If it were only men who demanded that women adhere to one-sided morality, it would be understandable. What is even more embarrassing is that the women themselves, who have suffered under the old ethical code, often use extremely harsh and unsympathetic attitudes to destroy and ridicule their unfortunate sisters! There are really many times when women are more vicious than men. Does it mean that someone who was mistreated by their mother-in-law when they were a young daughter-in-law must take revenge on the next generation when they become a mother-in-law? Does it mean that someone who does not have freedom, who does not get sexual satisfaction, cannot suppress their jealousy of others?</p>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Government's explicit expulsion of Wei Wenxiu this time has almost aroused public outrage. Perhaps the same thing will not happen again in the future. However, those people who only use contemptuous eyes to wound unfortunate women will continue to carry out their mission. In the past, they have forced tens of millions of Wei Wenxius to enter monasteries or commit suicide in anger. In the future, they will continue to force tens of millions of Wei Wenxius to enter monasteries or commit suicide in anger. Being expelled from the country by the Qingdao Municipal Government can still allow you to live in another country, but being despised by the general public is ubiquitous and unavoidable. Because those who regard sexual relations as each person's private matter and do not want to act as defenders of public morals are, after all, a tiny minority among the minority.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that enlightened sisters, in addition to resisting those decrees that oppress women, should strive to eradicate the feudal ideology of the general public, because that is a more fundamental and universal shackle, and unless we find a way to break free from it, we will never be liberated.</p>
<p>I have a little friend, whose personality was very depressed, and she died of pulmonary tuberculosis not long ago. According to my investigation, the main reason for her depressed personality was that she had suffered a lot of contempt from others since she was a child, because she was a "burden" of a remarried mother. In that corrupt old society, even the daughter of a remarried woman had to suffer such great pain. How much more the remarried woman herself must have suffered! Oppressed sisters, let us all work hard to do some work to eradicate feudal ideology, on the one hand, to save the "widow," and on the other hand, to save the children of those "widows"! Apart from voluntarily remaining a widow for emotional reasons, is there any other reason why one should remain a widow?</p>
<h3>"Women are made of water"!</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>As the spokesperson for Mr. Cao Xueqin's philosophy of women, Jia Baoyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" once said: "Women are made of water, and men are made of soil." By extension, his conclusion should be: "Therefore, women are intelligent as ice and snow, and gentle as water; while men are clumsy and heavy, and difficult to communicate with." This may be an intentional flattery (?) to women, so it is often enjoyed by general redologists. Especially because, from a certain point of view, it has an exquisite description of the personality of ordinary men and women, it is regarded by everyone as an immortal famous saying of interest.</p>
<p>Here, let's put aside the half of it about men and just want to re-examine and clarify the sentence "women are made of water":</p>
<p>In Bebel's book "Woman and Socialism," it is also repeatedly said that "the muscles of all parts of a woman's body are soft and rich in water"; "women's blood contains more water than men's"; "because the heart is small, the blood vessels are thin, and the blood contains more water, women's assimilation is weaker and they absorb less nutrients," and so on. Then, the saying that "women are made of water" cannot be fully affirmed based on this, but the amount of water they contain is more than that of men, which already has a scientific basis. Therefore, among men and women who are equally flesh and blood, we distinguish one as being made of soil and the other as being made of water; we can't help but express our strange admiration for Mr. Cao's X-ray vision. At the same time, the confirmed shortcomings of oneself – the source of weakness in the body that is forever inferior and forever unable to compete with men – evoke deep regret. (The main reason for opposing equal rights for men and women is that women's intelligence and physical strength are not as good as men's and they cannot bear the heavy responsibility of supporting society: the fact that water accounts for a large proportion is obviously clear proof that women's physical strength is not as good as men's?)</p>
<p>However, if you have a little common sense of biology, you can easily remember that today's domesticated poultry, curled up and docile, are ancestors who once had the glory of soaring freely in the wild. You should also know that today's apes and monkeys, which are recognized by children as the ancestors of human beings, are difficult to find in their descendants. This proves that there is a close relationship between the rise and fall of the environment and abilities. Whether it is a plant or an animal, under favorable conditions, the vitality is smooth; conversely, the vitality is blocked, or even destroyed. This is an objective fact that everyone cannot deny. In human beings, the spirit of all things, the response to different living conditions is also the same obvious: due to the differences in nourishment, physical and mental education, and occupation, it is inevitable that blood, brain, physique, etc. will undergo drastic changes.</p>
<p>Here, we can further observe the changes in the status of women from a historical perspective:</p>
<p>According to anthropology, ancient writings, or historical records, no one can deny that in primitive society, women had a relatively long period of activity. At that time, not only were the abilities of men and women (physical and mental) essentially the same—everyone was strong and rude—but in some cases, women even showed surprising facts that surpassed men. The matriarchal system formed in response to the activity of women is an iron-like historical trace.</p>
<p>After that, due to the increasing division of labor between the sexes, men gradually became the owners of tools and land. As men further dominated everything, women gradually became subordinate to men. At the same time, in order to maintain their permanent rights and dignity, men, on the one hand, set strict doctrines requiring women to abide by, and on the other hand, exerted soft ropes that made women gradually become docile, coaxing, luring, cherishing (cherishing like a flower or a bird)... and so on.</p>
<p>In order to make its owner feel at ease when going out, a woman should calmly stay at home; in order to win the owner's favor, a woman should gently love, caress, and comply with these requirements. Women should have a gentle physique, small hands, and delicate, fatty skin. At the same time, in order to cultivate elegance, they left rough work; in order to serve their masters, they reduced rich food,..... In this way, over time, their bones gradually became smaller, their muscles became weaker, and the so-called raw material for creating women, water, naturally surpassed men and had a larger percentage. In other words, because women have been dominated by men for thousands of years, the psychological or physiological development of women has gradually, gradually become increasingly different from that of men, so the water content is particularly abundant in women's bodies, which has a long origin; just like the general decline of other emotions, thoughts, actions, and intelligence, it has its causes!</p>
<p>However, what is sad is that women are pleased with their "being made of water." They ignore the heroic history of their ancestors and instead pride themselves on being soft and flowing as their true colors or showing off. Because of the lightness and transparency of water, they have suffered so much contempt, they are also willing to bow their heads and accept it. If people want to praise you, they will offer you like a potted flower between the table; if people want to belittle you, they will shout, "Go back to the kitchen," and you will obediently be a kitchen maid. Just like the nature of water to flow downward, women's position of being dominated, enslaved, played with, and despised is, from the general situation, getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>Should women always recognize that they are "made of water" and be indecisive, not thinking about being strong and striving forward? Should women always let people use the weakness of "taking shape according to the vessel" (which some people think is an advantage) and be arbitrarily arranged and categorized? Should women always be subject to the impact of evil forces and drift with the tide? Social changes will make healthy women gradually become docile, weak, and incompetent; another opposite social change will also make women return to being strong, brave, and active. When the general state of society is healthy, the development of women in all aspects will certainly reach the highest level; at that time, what will be rejoiced will not only be the humorous insult that "being made of water" is avoided?</p>
<p>The foundation of the new society is a life like steel. Striving to build oneself is to build a new society! The completion of the new society is also the completion of the highest personality of women!</p>
<h3>Little Xiu</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>"What's your name, girl?"</p>
<p>"Little Xiu. Why do you have to ask?"</p>
<p>"Knowing your name makes it easier to be polite when I come to bother you later!"</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Little Xiu, who runs a cigarette shop at the corner of the crossroads, answers this question almost every day. She is used to chatting and laughing with those rickshaw pullers, vendors, and coolies. They are her main customers.</p>
<p>Little Xiu's cigarette shop is not a house with doors and windows, nor does it have a signboard. It is a small wooden house like a movable police booth. The low roof shields it from the wind and rain. One side of the board can be pushed open, and Little Xiu's head peeks out from there, her eyes quietly staring outside. Inside the board, you can see cigarettes and matches. All are inferior cigarettes sold for ten to thirty cents each. Little Xiu knows that even if she prepares good ones, no one will buy them. These friends who are spinning the wheel of life with great effort do not have such extravagant dreams.</p>
<p>From morning to night, Little Xiu hides in that small wooden house. Only at mealtime does she jump out like a sparrow and run to a small shop less than ten steps away to buy turnips and pancakes. Once back, she sits on the only bench in the small house again. Sometimes, she exchanges things to eat with those who sell sweet potatoes and hard corn porridge.</p>
<p>"Not enough, girl, don't be too heartless. The baked sweet potato I gave you is big enough for three branches! How come you only give me two cigarettes?"</p>
<p>Little Xiu pursed her lower lip:</p>
<p>"You're the heartless one. Forget it, I'll give you another one! What a taste!"</p>
<p>Little Xiu doesn't understand why these people like to spend part of the money they earn with sweat on this. She has spent a lot of effort trying to plan things for others. For example, Lao Zhang's hat, which is so broken that it can't cover his ears, should be replaced, Xiao Wu is so thin and shouldn't push that cart of soil weighing hundreds of pounds, and De Shun's cough should be treated...</p>
<p>There are also people who are planning for Little Xiu.</p>
<p>"Where is your home? Your accent sounds like it's within two hundred miles, not out of Hebei!"</p>
<p>Little Xiu is tired of answering this question, so she impatiently says:</p>
<p>"Who cares, I don't know, I only know that my aunt is from Baoding Prefecture. I have no relatives except her."</p>
<p>Little Xiu doesn't tell lies. She was raised by her aunt. Her aunt used the money she made from braiding straw ropes at night to raise Little Xiu. Even the capital for this small wooden house was raised by her. Little Xiu can't go back at night, and the shop has to be guarded. Only her aunt comes to see Little Xiu from outside the city every ten days and a half, takes ten or eight strings of coins and leaves, with a smile on the corner of her mouth, secretly praising herself for having an idea.</p>
<p>However, Little Xiu's booming business brought disaster.</p>
<p>The police officer at the crossroads stares at Little Xiu every day with direct eyes. This is not a lively crossroads. At night, only the police officer accompanies the streetcar and the vendors. The dim light makes the night even more lonely.</p>
<p>On the windy night, the police officer knocked on Little Xiu's wooden room. It was past midnight, and there wasn't even a ghost on the street.</p>
<p>"Open the door!" The voice was so greedy.</p>
<p>Little Xiu, figuring out who it was, asked:</p>
<p>"Why don't you stay in the police booth?"</p>
<p>"Too cold!"</p>
<p>Gently knocking on the wooden door, the police officer finally walked away angrily, every cell filled with sparks. He waited for his shift change.</p>
<p>Four days after that night, Little Xiu's cigarette shop was sealed, and she was taken away for interrogation, accused of being obscene and indecent, using the name of running a cigarette shop to seduce ordinary coolies and vendors.</p>
<p>The small wooden house was pushed away by Little Xiu's aunt. She prepared to wait for the girl to come back and then set up a stall at any road corner in the east city.</p>
<p>However, the news that came was that she would be released only after paying a fine of five yuan, so the small wooden house was sold.</p>
<h3>Remarried Women in Meixian</h3>
<p>— Lin Xiaoqin</p>
<p>——The Collusion of Superstition and Old Ethical Codes——</p>
<p>Meixian, Guangdong, is considered a relatively open place, but the forces of the old ethical codes still occupy almost the entire society. Women take sayings such as "remaining faithful to one husband to the end," "a virtuous woman does not serve two husbands," and "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog" as golden rules and jade laws. No matter how dissatisfied women are with their own marriages, they absolutely do not dare to make a request for divorce themselves: women who have lost their husbands also do not dare to remarry. In fact, women are by no means willing to suffer. However, the discrimination in society against divorced or remarried women makes it even more unbearable, so they would rather submit. Secondly, society also uses superstitious methods to scare women, so that they do not dare to have the idea of divorce or remarriage.</p>
<p>The old ethical code is cruel and inhumane. People cannot help but ask the question, "Why should it be like this?" The maintainers of the old ethical code feel that the reasons cannot convince people, so they use superstition as a tool for maintenance. It is pitiful that people lacking knowledge are actually deceived!</p>
<p>I will now write out the old customs of women's divorce and remarriage in Meixian as factual evidence, or it can also be used by sociologists as research material.</p>
<p>(1) Remarriage of Married Women: An unfortunate woman, from the time she is born, her parents marry her to someone else, to be a child bride or to be a daughter-in-law waiting for a son (having a daughter-in-law before having a son is called a daughter-in-law waiting for a son). When she reaches adulthood, it is extremely difficult if she wants to divorce and remarry because of a bad husband or because her husband despises her. When she goes through the separation procedures, no one can help her. Superstition tells them that managing other people's divorce affairs will be unlucky, so not only do bystanders ignore it, but even the husband is unwilling to write a divorce letter himself, but only allows someone to get the husband's consent and ask a beggar to write it for him. However, problems can also occur in the place where the divorce letter is written. If you live near a river, you write it by the river. If you live in a mountain village, you have to write it next to the tomb. When the wedding day comes, you have to run to a very remote place to comb your hair and dress up. If people in nearby villages find out, they will definitely be blamed and scolded by everyone. Superstition tells them that the place where divorced women change clothes is unlucky.</p>
<p>(2) Remarriage of Widows: The remarriage of widows is not only as difficult as the remarriage of married women, but also has extra superstitious procedures. Superstition says that the soul of the widow's deceased husband is always following her. If she remarries against the will of the soul, the soul will run to her new husband's home, causing her new husband to suffer misfortune. Therefore, a few days before the wedding, she has to leave her parents and steal to a nunnery to live before dawn or in the middle of the night. On the wedding day, she also has to buy a pair of wooden clogs to wear when entering the door. When she arrives at the door, she has to change into wooden clogs and is not allowed to enter the door wearing shoes. This is the only way to prevent her dead ex-husband from recognizing her footprints.</p>
<p>With the above kinds of superstitions, remarried women are treated one level lower than ordinary women. Therefore, men in Meixian who live a slightly more stable life, or men with some status in society, absolutely do not marry remarried women. As a natural result, remarried women must find their spouses in the ranks of poor men who disregard everything, or in groups of men who are considered one level lower. Otherwise, they can only endure the pain and never remarry for the rest of their lives. This method of maintaining the old ethical code is really vicious, and one cannot help but admire its ingenuity.</p>
<p>Those who are determined to break the old ethical code and engage in the women's movement should know that breaking superstition is also a work that cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Sea Head Girl</h3>
<p>— Tie Huai</p>
<p>In my hometown, in that hometown of mine located on the coast, what I can't forget most is naturally the solemn and magnificent seascape, and the beautiful and dazzling sunrise rising slowly from the sea; but what I can't forget especially is that group of "Sea Head Girls" filled with natural beauty and possessing a strong character.</p>
<p>"Sea Head Girls," this is a local expression almost everyone in my hometown understands. It means they live near the seashore, they mix with the waves like tide chasers every day in the seawater, and they depend on the sea for a living. Naturally, they also have their own families.</p>
<p>Their lives consist of going to cast nets to catch fish when the tide is high (this work is still done more by men; we call these men "Sea Head People"). When the tide recedes, they go to collect earthworms. In addition, they often dry salt on the salt flats, build salt ponds, carry salt brine, doing the same work as men. Those who have fields also till the land and plant vegetables. When they have free time, they go to the city in groups of three or five to sell earthworms, sell vegetables, sell seafood, cut foreign grass, and pick shepherd's purse. I remember when I was in my hometown, every morning when I heard the high-pitched voice of "Selling cabbage, yellow bud cabbage" in my sleepy haze, I would often wake up with a start and sit up involuntarily. At four or five in the afternoon, when the sun was about to set, it seemed to be their most leisurely time. They cut grass until their baskets were full, singing mountain songs as they returned, their heads always wrapped in a primitive "printed cloth," their hair buns tied high, with a red bone hairpin always stuck in the bun.</p>
<p>Probably because they live by the sea, their faces are dark, but they all have great strength. If anyone bullies them, it's like disturbing the god of Jupiter or scratching a tiger's brow. They will surely be met with their scolding and a round of ridicule, and you simply won't be able to stop until you apologize. Everyone in our hometown knows that Sea Head Girls are not to be trifled with. I feel that their inner and outer selves are full of natural beauty. It's rare for our women to have that kind of strong disposition.</p>
<p>Their mountain songs are unique, mostly sung when they are carrying grass back home. I once clearly understood one: "Sea salt pagoda is seven stories high, inside the seven-story pagoda is a seven-star knife, on the seven-star knife are seven words: Stab the husband to death and sit in jail." Although I can't ascertain whether that mountain song specifically refers to a particular event, their spirit of resistance is evident here. Male readers, please rest assured! I am definitely not trying to use the mountain songs in the mouths of Sea Head Girls to awaken the murderous intent in every woman, to harm her beloved or estranged husband. This is just one example to show that our Sea Head Girls have such boldness and such courage. I often regret that I wasn't born in Sea Head. If my character had been nurtured by the sea, it would at least be a little stronger than it is now.</p>
<p>Unforgettable Sea Head Girls! Unforgettable red bone hairpin headscarves, unforgettable earthworm and cabbage cries, and even more unforgettable bold mountain songs, I wish you to be with the sea forever! This year's rural bankruptcy, can it bankrupt you? How will you continue to fight against nature and struggle with society?</p>

<h3>Humanity and Nature</h3>
<p>— Liu Wei</p>
<p>All things exist and develop in contradiction, this is a fundamental law of the universe. The evolution of the relationship between humanity and nature also progresses under its governance. Humanity is a part of nature, it is itself composed of natural materials, and has evolved, advanced, and developed from natural materials. Not only that, but for its continued existence, all needs for clothing, food, and shelter must still be taken from nature, and be nourished by nature. Thus, humanity comes from nature, nature is its mother and nurturer, it cannot survive and develop without relying on nature. However, humanity does not simply conform to nature, it also rebels against nature and fights with nature. Its labor and production lies in overcoming nature, making nature adapt to its own survival purposes, and utilizing nature to satisfy its life. Thus, Lord Lancaster compared humanity to a rebellious child in the family of nature, saying it often violates the will of heaven. The will of heaven commands it, saying, "You must die," but it protests loudly, "No, I must live." Indeed, if it is right to say that humanity must conform to nature in order to survive, then it is also right for us to say that humanity must also resist nature and fight with nature in order to survive. The survival of humanity is based on its relationship with nature, which is both harmonious and contradictory, and it continues to develop and evolve with this continuous harmony and contradiction.</p>
<p>Here, I only need to cite one or two facts as examples to make it clear. The human hand is the main tool for engaging in labor and production. With it, humanity has created its own society and culture, created a way of life that is fundamentally different from animals, created its own unique history, and obtained special development and evolution. However, the hand is first of all a natural organ of the animal species of humanity in the natural world, that is to say, one of the natural things. Not only is its essence also a group of natural substances such as atoms, chemical molecules, and cells, composed of various elements; but no matter how clever and agile the hand is, able to manufacture tools, write articles, and depict works of art, the movement of its joints in activity cannot but rely on the lever movement of mechanics, etc., that is, it cannot but be carried out under the control of the laws of physics of nature. Not only that, but the human hand evolved from the forelimbs of animals, and the reason why these forelimbs were able to evolve into human hands was the natural environment on the trees during the arboreal life of human ancestors, and the natural environment that guided them after leaving arboreal life and arriving on the plains, and fighting with animals and even general nature, that is, it was formed from guidance such as climbing, picking fruits, grasping objects, picking up stones, and making tools. In a word, the human hand comes from nature, and nature is constantly creating it. However, in this labor process, humanity also uses its hands to fight with nature and resist nature. For example, reaching out to pick fruits is fighting with the spatial distance that places the fruits high on the trees outside its mouth, picking up stones is fighting with fierce beasts, and manufacturing all kinds of tools is fighting with any difficult environment in the natural world. The knife is used to overcome things that have hardness and cannot be split by physical strength, the boat is used to overcome the obstruction of water. Only with these struggles can he use his forelimbs for labor, and the forelimbs can become hands, and become tool-making organs. To give another example, the survival and evolution of humanity depends on society, but society is formed by the contact and exchange between human beings, this natural thing, and other natural things, forming a labor production process; the existence and evolution of society also requires natural factors and productive energy to succeed, this is where society is a part of nature and comes from nature. However, as the source of the existence of society, labor and production is fundamentally about utilizing nature and overcoming nature, so society is also fighting and contradicting nature, and people evolve, develop, and live in this contradictory opposition.</p>
<p>Indeed, man is great, he is not like ordinary animals, only listening to the dictates of nature. Man evolves himself in the struggle with nature, changing his own organism, life, and environment. It can be said that human history is created by himself, while the history of ordinary animals is simply created by nature. However, we must know that the ability of mankind to fight with nature and force nature to adapt to its own purposes is not because he has any special supernatural power, but because he uses the power of nature itself to subdue nature, and uses the laws of nature itself to drive nature. No matter how great mankind is, if he does not rely on nature and does not use the laws of nature, he will not be able to do anything about nature. It is very obvious that mankind cannot forge iron and make it into ironware without using fire; cannot split things and fell trees without using a knife; cannot hammer without using gravity; cannot make airplanes and develop aviation without using the buoyancy of air. The so-called science is the knowledge of the research and organization of all natural properties and their laws, and the fact that mankind uses science to develop production and conquer nature is actually using nature to deal with nature. Therefore, the greatness of mankind lies only in being able to manipulate nature to submit to himself, and work for himself according to his own purposes and needs. In this way, humanity's control over nature, even in the point of dominating nature, is also limited. This limitation is due on the one hand to the fact that although he can exterminate individual things in nature, he cannot exterminate natural forces, and cannot abolish the laws of nature; on the other hand, mankind's domination of nature is both domination and submission to nature, because he must be limited by the condition of obeying the laws of nature in order to dominate nature, it is domination and also submission to this. As such, humanity often struggles against nature in the past, and nature also often gives mankind retaliatory retribution, destroying his victory. The fact that Italians in the past cut down the forests on the southern mountainsides, but unexpectedly the livestock industry there would be greatly affected as a result, is a fact. Nevertheless, this kind of rebellious action of nature is precisely the reason for mankind to constantly improve its ways of fighting against nature, etc., and the progress of mankind is buried here.</p>
<p>From the above, the relationship between humanity and nature, as well as humanity's own survival and progress, are all obtained in contradictory struggle. Absolute obedience and ignorance of struggling with his environment not only does not have human progress, but also does not have the possibility of survival. If the ancestors of mankind had only succumbed to nature from the beginning, and completely listened to his environment to play tricks, then it would have been impossible to leave the animals and advance to mankind, and there would have been no mankind existing on earth. If he could not continue to contradict and fight with nature thereafter, then mankind would probably still be the original people to this day, and there would be no present evolution. However, the power of mankind is also limited, he can only have the ability to exist, evolve, struggle, and resist within nature, and he is powerless and there is no mankind without leaving nature. Those who think that man is a supernatural thing, and that mankind has its special supernatural power to dominate, change, and create the world, are completely wrong. Mankind comes from the contradictory laws of the universe with nature, struggle is his authority, and is the root of his evolution and survival.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Methodology</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Professor Liang Shiqiu said: "Today, people who study learning like to talk about methods, as if method is a brick to knock on the door, a key, and once they get the method, they can enter the hall and enter the room. In my opinion, at least in literary research, method is of course important, but the most important thing is still hard work. If the hard work is done well, even if the method is a bit stupid, there will be achievements. If the hard work is not enough, no matter what method is useless." (See page 190 of "Prejudice Collection") However, in fact, if there is no method, there is no way to start hard work: all people who have studied learning since ancient times, and those who use dead work, are conducting their research under a certain method. The teaching method of the old teacher who teaches people to read "Confucius said" all day long, only talking about memorization, and not seeking understanding, although very clumsy, is also a method. Therefore, people who use dead work under his education also implement it in this clumsy method. Aristotle can always be said to be a person who uses hard work, but if he does not have the method of formal selection, then all his works have no way to be completed. Engels is also a great philosopher, but if he does not have the moving logic, then he will absolutely not be able to defeat Dühring and complete his great philosophical masterpiece. Therefore, I say, "Method is a brick to knock on the door, a key." Without it, all researchers will have no way to start hard work, and will not get any results. Hegel attached so much importance to methodology in his philosophy, and all academic debates since ancient times have been centered on methodology, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>"Method is a key," but not every key can open the iron locks that lock the doors of various academic disciplines. Only the key that matches this iron lock can open the doors of various academic disciplines and "enter the hall and enter the room." If a certain method is like a key that matches a lock, then only by using the correct method to study academics can we obtain the correct conclusions; conversely, regardless of how much hard work is done outside of the wrong method, it is impossible to explore the truth. This situation can be said to be the same as the inability of a key that does not fit a lock to open the door. We know that some Buddhist monks are chanting "Amitabha" all day long, using dead work—but in the end, they still cannot understand the social significance of Buddhism. Although Babbitt's disciples are working hard to study the "laws of human affairs" and using dead work, they are ultimately unable to recognize "human affairs" and solve the "problem," and have no choice but to abandon religion and serve the imperialists. From this, it can be seen that under the wrong "clumsy method," even if hard work is used, there will not be any good results. George said well: "There is no guarantee that there will be errors in the conclusions,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>and these can be corrected when the correct method is applied later. But conversely, it is extremely rare for an erroneous method to give us results that do not contradict any part of a certain truth."</p>
<p>Research methods are like production tools. If production tools are used to manufacture products, then the method of studying academics is the tool for obtaining knowledge; also, if the production tools of handicrafts can only manufacture crude products, and new mechanical production tools are needed to produce very exquisite things, then backward research methods can only obtain backward knowledge, and only new and advanced research methods can obtain new and advanced knowledge. Therefore, in our pursuit of new and advanced knowledge, obtaining new and advanced research methods is more important than anything else.</p>
<p>The method we have used in the past is formal logic, which has been adopted by scholars in general since Aristotle. This formal logic has three supreme laws, namely:</p>
<p>1.  A is A - Law of Identity</p>
<p>2.  A is not not A - Law of Contradiction</p>
<p>3.  Non-A is B - Law of Excluded Middle</p>
<p>On the surface, this seems to be a truth that is consistent with objective things, and therefore it is also a method that can explore the essence of objective things. However, human knowledge has developed to the present, and it has already recognized that objective things are not so simple and rigid. Due to the development of industry and all the inventions in natural science, we have long known that all objective things are not absolutely static, but are developing and changing in contradiction. Newton's theorem that all objects at rest remain at rest and all objects in motion remain in motion has long been overturned by Einstein's theory of relativity. Because all things are developing and changing, and exist relatively, all objectively existing things are both like this and like that at the same time, and are A and non-A at the same time. For example, a bowl of water, it is constantly evaporating and turning into gas. When you say this is a bowl of water, a part of it has already turned into gas, and it is still continuing to change, and it is not the original bowl of water anymore. Therefore, if you say that this bowl of water is this bowl of water and not something else, then it is not consistent with the facts and is wrong. Also, a person has been living day by day since he was born, and at the same time he has been approaching death day by day, that is, dying day by day; if we say from the point of view that he is living, then he is living day by day; conversely, if we say from the point of view that he is getting closer to death, then he is also dying day by day: so we can say that a person is living and dying at the same time. —Examples of this kind are too numerous to mention. Due to these examples, and due to the explanation of the actual situation of these objective things, we should be able to know that formal logic is not consistent with objective things, and therefore it is also a wrong research method that cannot explore objective truth. If you want to explore objective truth and seek new and advanced knowledge, then you can only treat the old textbooks of formal logic as a common sense textbook, and you should not use it as the only method for studying learning and dealing with problems. We must strive to obtain a new and advanced method that is consistent with objective events—moving logic. When you already have steam and electric farming tools, you still have to use hoes and sickles to work; similarly, when you already have advanced and new moving logic, you still want to use the formal logic method, then you are either a mediocre person who is willing to lag behind, or a fool who knows nothing!</p>
<p>So, what is the so-called moving logic? This is a question that cannot be answered in detail in such a short article. Dear readers, please read all the great works written by Engels, George...etc. Here I only say: All things are developing and changing in contradiction, and are interrelated. The so-called moving logic is a reflection of this actual situation of things, and it is to understand and deal with things in the contradictory development process of things, and in their mutual connection.</p>
<p>Indeed, we must use hard work, but we must grasp the new and advanced method—moving logic—to use hard work, and we should not do futile and useless stupid things in backward methods. As the times have progressed to the present, the complexity of all things has been revealed, and various academic disciplines have a long history and rich content. If we do not grasp this new and advanced method—moving logic—that is consistent with the actual situation of objective things to study them, even if we use dead work, we will not be able to obtain the truth. Therefore, I say that in modern times, if we want to explore the truth and obtain correct knowledge, hard work is of course very important, but obtaining new and advanced methodology—moving logic—is especially important. Here I advise the generally hardworking youth to first read those books that explain this moving logic, and to obtain this new method of studying learning and dealing with problems—moving logic.</p>

<h3>Singing Girl</h3>
<p>— Liu Xinzi</p>
<p>Melon seeds, smoke, tea essence, hot steaming popularity...</p>
<p>The roaring is full of noisy sounds, long gowns, melon skin hats, scarves, suits, shiny hair, brush-like beards, northern tycoons, pot-bellied merchants, and also young masters.</p>
<p>Crack——peel, melon seeds are divided into two pieces.</p>
<p>The tide of people, the swollen human form in the Chinese-style overcoat, followed by another, round-mouthed square shoes with a figure-eight gait, stepping from that imported round hole.</p>
<p>It is the Moon Palace on earth!</p>
<p>People filled all the gaps, the electric lights above their heads, the neon lights were flashing, the heat almost suffocated people, the four walls were covered with Little Mengjun's colored trophies, vulgar scarlet banners: "Pearl throat melodious", "Born with beauty", "Echoing for three days (?)", these hymns of lust!</p>
<p>Servants, wearing blue short jackets, red striped trim, shuttle in and out of the crowd, the heat of hot water, the heat of hot hands, white and diffuse, can not see the human form across the way.</p>
<p>Ghost-like people still come in groups of three or five from the holes and openings, and the aisles are filled with chairs.</p>
<p>——Damn it, he's wearing a suit, isn't he? That mother! I don't have money?</p>
<p>This big man slammed the square table, with a clang, water splashed on the ground, the big man's sight was finally blocked by the seat temporarily arranged by the young man in the suit. The young man in the suit sat down indifferently, but the big man still glared at the servant with fiery eyes.</p>
<p>The electric light on the stage flashed, and the gongs and drums shook the eardrums.</p>
<p>The sound of conversation almost increased in the same example, and the spirit-like people were all excited.</p>
<p>——Mold is enough. B Su Anke, self-propelled out...</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums became more and more high-pitched, but people were impatient to sit, leaning over and whistling.</p>
<p>The roaring is full of noisy sounds. Melon seeds, smoke, tea essence, hot steaming popularity,</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>"Good!" The sharp sound of the double turn, as if the end of the world had come, a big commotion.</p>
<p>A red woman flew lightly from the green curtain, her back to the audience, her black hair covered her head and lowered her head, her pink and white long lotus root, supporting herself on the half square table.</p>
<p>The face of the red woman, suddenly turned over, shining bright lights, the blood-red small mouth spitting out strange tones, this slaughtered miserable cry! ——The thin body is tilted to the side, the red-clothed high collar supports a face made of plaster, the rippling eyes, flying from here to there, from the sideburns to the pink and white face. After the enchanting smile, the slender fingers grasped the wavy hair again.</p>
<p>The huqin player pulled the strings desperately. Under the stage, everyone's necks were pulled as long as the strings.</p>
<p>These people are mostly hedonists of the eyes!</p>
<p>In the whole scene of numb-like frenzy, the red woman flashed into the curtain like a light swallow.</p>
<p>When the second woman came out, another small commotion started under the stage. "Yo——Haha"</p>
<p>"Ya——Hahahaha——"</p>
<p>This is an aging woman's face, although she still retains the traces of her former madness, but no one will pay attention to this. She lowered her head painfully, singing a sad song, and when the tone was high and sharp, her heart was full of depression and tears, but the sound of "Shh——Shh——" came from the four corners of the crowd.</p>
<p>There is no art here, only the temptation of flesh.</p>
<p>After people sent the singing girl away in the disgusting air, the other unopened electric lights in the ceiling of the stage were opened together. Crystal Palace-like brightness! Flower baskets, silver shields, were arranged by the servants in rows on the stage and on the half-square table. The names of the captives were written on these many precious gifts.</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums, and the enthusiastic mood of the crowd, had surpassed the climax and reached the tip. The nameplate changed the three words "Little Mengjun". "Little Mengjun" pierced into the eyes of the erotomaniacs. Ah! Little Mengjun, the master of color, whistles were fired from all directions like firecrackers.</p>
<p>Really, Little Mengjun had stood on the stage that shone like daylight, and was being captured by hundreds of greedy eyes. She, a very fashionable clothes rack, very charming eyes, very coquettish posture, she is the ruler in the kingdom of eroticism, is the proud king!</p>
<p>Just as the fiery red two small petals were unfolding, the tone of the huqin and her voice did not coincide, I do not know whether it was the negligence of the musicians, or her mistake? However, the masses did not pay attention to this point, and still used their own boiling enthusiasm to hook the various parts of the flesh with their eyes.</p>
<p>In the plain and unremarkable time, all kinds of strange cries will be scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>The big beard narrowed his eyes. Wiped his beard, nodded lightly. The eyes of the young man in the suit could not wait to make the eyeglass circles bigger.</p>
<p>The big beard waved his hand to the right corner, and the boss bent his back and walked gently in front of the big beard, smiling cautiously. Ordering a play, the sign written on red paper was hung up, "Mr. Mao ordered a play; Qiu Hu Teasing His Wife!" The little white face also touched his pocket, glared with jealous eyes, and looked for the boss.</p>
<p>"Another one!"</p>
<p>"Another one!"</p>
<p>Numerous whistles rolled.</p>
<p>The queen was finally gone. On the flower nameplate in front of the stage, the servant was putting on another singing girl's nameplate.</p>

<h3>An Impression of the Three Gorges</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>The Three Gorges is the most precipitous mountain gorge in the Yangtze River basin, located at the junction of Hubei and Sichuan, where the Daba Mountains obstruct the Yangtze River. The Three Gorges consist of Qutang Gorge, Wu Gorge, and Xiling Gorge. It is a famous and strategically important natural site in China. It is said that Zhuge Wuhou's "Eight Trigrams Formation" was located at the sixty-odd piles of small stones on the west side of Xiaguan in Qutang Gorge. It is no wonder that many writers often refer to the Three Gorges as the gateway to Sichuan Province. Even in recent decades, since the collapse of the Manchu Qing Empire, Sichuan's relationship with the central government has formed a political situation of being close yet distant. This is naturally a natural phenomenon of the deformed development of China's politics and economy, but the natural barrier that the Three Gorges poses between Sichuan Province and the outside world cannot be said to be without significance.</p>
<p>I remember Li Bai having a poem saying: "Departing from Baidi amidst the colorful clouds at dawn, return to Jiangling in a thousand miles in a day. The monkeys on both banks keep calling, the light boat has passed ten thousand mountains." Yes, this kind of description in old poems is still realistic to this day. If travelers visit the Three Gorges, they may have to repeatedly recite Li Bai's poems. According to my personal experience of going back and forth through the Three Gorges several times, I feel that the fatigue of each journey is completely dispelled when the ship passes through the Three Gorges, amidst the magnificent and precipitous towering mountains and cliffs. A person who has visited the Three Gorges always has a very deep and strong impression in their mind. I feel that the strong impression is just like the symbols of overlapping mountain ranges drawn on a map. Now, I will describe my actual impressions in detail as follows:</p>
<p>From Hubei to Sichuan, passing west of Yichang, in less than three hours, the ship enters the Xiling Gorge. Continuing west, about half a day, is the scope of the Wu Gorge. After ten hours, the Qutang Gorge can also be passed. Here is Baidi City, which Li Bai called "departing from Baidi amidst the colorful clouds at dawn." Hundreds of miles of mountain gorges stretch continuously. The continuous peaks flank the banks, truly ten thousand fathoms towering into the sky. Fierce and terrifying strange rocks and exquisite and lovely mountain scenery are completely contained on the cliffs on both sides. From the ship in the heart of the river, seeing the undulating pictures of those staggered cliffs, one cannot find the mountain paths along the river. However, the locals operating in the rugged valleys can be faintly seen in the distance. As for what Li Bai called "the monkeys on</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>both banks keep calling," we did not experience that on the ship. Because the banks of the Three Gorges are not as wide as the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it is actually difficult to hear the calls of monkeys on the surface of the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges. Moreover, the ship going upstream against the current, the specially enlarged horsepower has made the ship vibrate very severely. The sound of the motor starting is of course doubly loud. There is also the rapid current of the river pouring down, washing against the progress of the ship. Without experienced passengers, they would probably be frightened by that kind of tense navigation. The symphony of water and ship sounds is like the roaring tide of the sea. At that time, people seem to only feel that the great force of nature can dominate their own destiny.</p>
<p>According to the crew members of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the steel plates of the ships that need to pass through the Three Gorges must be thicker than those of ordinary sea ships; otherwise, the ship would be in danger of being broken by the river water. Therefore, the materials of the ships traveling back and forth in the Three Gorges can be used to make warships. Regarding this point, we feel that the Chinese people's strength in fighting against nature is not less than that of the foreign imperialists in fighting against the tides. This makes me feel excited about the following things:</p>
<p>When the ship passes through the Three Gorges, how nervously the river pilots are working! Their ages are all several decades old. It is said that they rely entirely on their experience of navigating wooden boats in those years, remembering the position or direction of the reefs and shoals in any area along the river. The navigation of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River relies entirely on their valuable experience to operate the ships; unfortunately, they have not scientifically sorted out and studied it. We are worried that this purely local national product authority may not last long. In case those few old river pilots grow old and die, except for what they secretly pass on to a few apprentices, then this valuable and rare technology will inevitably be out of print like ancient books. I don't know if the people who advocate industry today are trying to remedy this matter?</p>
<p>Secondly, between the rocks on both banks of the Three Gorges, there are many black mineral liquids of petroleum flowing out. The new and old traces of those petroleum flows can be seen on the ship at any time. This is obviously a manifestation of the rich mineral resources of the Daba Mountains. According to a geologist, the amount of coal, iron, and petroleum stored in the Daba Mountains can be called the first-class mineral area in the interior. I wonder when this natural resource can be mined? Following the impressions from the north, a traveler who arrives at this natural treasure trove cannot help but associate it with the social life of the locals here.</p>
<p>I remember that many people who study cultural issues all admit that "the process of mankind overcoming nature is a symbol of the culture of social life." Based on this principle, the great power of the natural environment of the Three Gorges has not yet been conquered by the humans there; this is the reason why the indigenous people of that place are still living a very low cultural life!</p>
<p>When our ship passes through the Three Gorges, although it feels a bit desolate, at the same time, on the edge of the river, wooden boats can still be found from time to time. They are not necessarily dedicated to sailing in the relatively calm Tuo Bay. Many times, the river water pours down so rapidly like boiling water in a pot, and the most angry place where the waves jump, they still sail forward as usual. It is difficult to see their progress going upstream. Although, the commerce in the Three Gorges area does rely on this means of transportation. The grain, coarse cloth, salt, and various daily necessities there are completely transported and supplied by this means of transportation.</p>
<p>The farmers in the Three Gorges plant relatively little rice. Because it is all mountainous, miscellaneous grains such as corn and beans are the main production. Opium also has considerable reproduction. In addition, farmers also rely on mineral resources for their livelihood. They are neither "mine owners" nor "miners." There is no such term there at all. They are just picking up some coal from the cliffs of nature, just like picking up stones, and transporting them to county towns or cities for retail. They don't need to pay costs, they only rely on their own strength, they pick up as much coal as they can carry. Therefore, when they transport coal to the market for sale, they usually don't care about the price, they only seek to sell it off, and they are satisfied with exchanging some money to buy daily necessities home. This is what a friend who lives in Wu Gorge told me.</p>

<h3>Humans and Beasts in the Same View</h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>If "Humans and Beasts in the Same View" appears as the advertisement name of a movie, then it is at most only used to describe the content of a movie, indicating that warriors, beauties, and giant beasts are mixed together, performing many struggles, terrors, and love spectacles to arouse the audience's emotions and admiration. There is no social relationship embodied here, so in addition to its artistic value itself, there is no profound meaning. We often see many trivial news in the odd bits of newspapers and magazines, not that when a certain millionaire in a certain country dies, he makes a will to allocate thousands of thousands of dollars to his beloved dog to inherit, or that a certain dog star or horse star in a certain country leaves behind a certain amount of property after his death, which is inherited by his owner. Originally, in the past human history, the owner and inheritor of property were only those who were humans. The owner of property would bequeath the property to his children or friends, and only his children or beloved friends could be his property inheritors. Even if the property can sometimes be donated to charitable public welfare organizations, but in order to comply with the fact that only humans can enjoy and handle property, the law cannot but give these social organizations the qualification of artificial persons, calling them legal persons. Thus, the inheritance and succession of property, even if it is not entirely real people, must be legal persons to have this right. That is to say, the inheritor and successor of property must always be people with human qualifications, which means that property and individual personality are closely combined and cannot be separated. But now it is not the case, social evolution has evolved to the era when individual property and direct management and disposal by individuals are not necessary, property can not only—but must—leave its own storage warehouse, leave its own hands, let it independently act in society, circulate, fulfill its own role, and generally also progress to a social era where it does not need to be directly managed, operated, and disposed of, but can only be handed over to an agent to manage and dispose of it, and others only need to be under the condition of property sovereignty, can manage, operate, and dispose of everything for you, property and the individual's body and even personality do not necessarily have a close direct relationship. No matter what kind of subject it is, as long as someone manages and handles it on its behalf, this property can still fulfill its role in society, act, circulate, and generate income in society. Therefore, the law can ignore the subject's character and only stipulate a sovereignty. Because it does not require this subject to have direct handling ability, and the subject's lack of this ability can not hinder the complete occurrence of this property's social role. This situation is clearly demonstrated by the emergence of modern joint-stock companies. Obviously, if it is an old feudal landlord or aristocrat, his silver is either hidden by his side, or he has to directly lend money and collect interest, that is to say, he has to directly manage and dispose of it. But now there is a new method of joint-stock companies, you only need to buy a stock, then the company's business, etc., are all hired to manage, the how to allocate, exercise, do not need you to ask, naturally someone will act on your behalf to do everything you can and are willing to do, you only need to take the stock and sit back and enjoy the dividends. In appearance, this situation is to call your property does not know you this owner, and does not allow you to casually move it and dominate it, how it acts in the company or society, you do not need to ask. Isn't this property leaving the individual's body and personality to act independently?</p>
<p>Because of this, so in the case where the property owner's subject loses the necessity and possibility of managing and disposing of it himself, it does not matter whether the property's subject is a human or a beast, as long as there is someone who acts on his behalf to exercise property rights. So this dog has property, and its property can be inherited by humans, humans have property, and their property can be inherited by dogs, which is precisely embodies the changes in property relations in modern society, embodies property leaving the individual's personality to act independently, embodies that non-property owners can handle other people's property, individual property can be handed over to anyone who is unrelated to property ownership to manage, etc. social relations.</p>

<h3>"Water Collection"</h3>
<p>— Wu Fangyu</p>
<p>Correspondence from Bin County, Shaanxi</p>
<p>People who have not been to Shaanxi always have a fantasy about it, thinking that it is the capital of the Qin State in the Spring and Autumn Period, and of course there are many historical relics for people to reminisce. Indeed, there are many historical relics here, but there are also remnants of the early centuries who have not shed their historical nature! The thinking of the people here has not left the era of theocracy; their masters are either Mount Hua or Mount Taibai, and all the doubts, misfortunes and blessings are decided by these two mountains to their final fate.</p>
<p>The mountain peaks in Shaanxi Province, except for Sichuan Province, probably no other province can compare with it; however, the rivers are so few that people dare not believe it, and rainwater seems to have a lifelong feud with Shaanxi, and it is not willing to come here three times a year. The people here see water as more precious than gold, and they usually do not condone wasting a drop of water unconditionally; water is their second life, and they are always willing to make great sacrifices for water.</p>
<p>Recently, although several new canals have been opened in the Wei River area of Xi'an, connecting the source of water, the paddy fields along the canal will not reappear the panic of severe drought; however, it is still impossible to bring water into the fields in places slightly far from the canal. Therefore, during the summer and autumn seasons, rainwater is still as difficult to find as gold mines; when the general villagers are helpless, they have to pray to their masters - the Bodhisattvas. This is the so-called "praying for rain."</p>
<p>Praying for rain is also called "water collection" here, and they are very grand about the "water collection" ceremony; in advance, each village elects a person with upright character as the "chairman," and another few capable people are elected to assist in everything. The first sacrifice to the gods is in the local temple, setting up a long incense table, on which there are many sacrificial offerings for the gods; incense and candles are filled with incense burners, and the incense smoke fills the entire hall. After everything is offered, the "chairman" presides over the sacrifice, respectfully performing the grand ceremony of three kneelings and nine kowtows towards the Bodhisattva; after the "chairman" finishes the ceremony, he retreats to the side, and finally the crowds of each surname kneel and kowtow in turn. At this time, the hall is filled with a solemn atmosphere, as silent as if in an ice cellar, and even the sound of breathing is considered too loud. After this sacrifice is held, people seem to rush out of the water, and the sound wave is so high that even the sound of speaking opposite each other cannot be heard clearly; then there is a sky-shattering sound of gongs and drums, beating day and night, and even people several miles away can imagine the lively situation here.</p>
<p>After the "sacrifice to the gods" is completed, then comes the "setting up the altar"; the form of this "setting up the altar" is even more solemn. On this day, all the people who participate must "fast" before they are allowed to enter. At the gate of the temple, there are two "divine sticks" placed crosswise; the two ends of the "divine sticks" are painted black, and the middle is red, as if they are military sticks used in the army, but their authority is only greater than that of military sticks. When ordinary people watching the excitement see this kind of "divine stick," they instinctively stop; for women, it is even more severely forbidden, and they are absolutely not allowed to pass even on the roads near the temple outside. The day after the altar is set up, three people with high morals are selected from the crowds attending the meeting to represent going up the mountain (this mountain is Mount Hua or Mount Taibai) to start "collecting water."</p>
<p>Each of the three people selected to go up the mountain to "collect water" wears a circle made of willow branches on their head, one person carries a "willow basket" in the basket and puts a magnetic bottle; one person carries dry food, prepared to fill their hunger on the road; and another person carries a small gong, walking and beating it. On this long journey of dozens of miles, these three people are absolutely not allowed to rest; at night, they still have to find a temple, and light a stick of incense in the open air, and one of the three people quietly kneels on the spot until the stick of incense is about to burn out, then another person takes over and burns incense and kowtows in the same way. Like this, they take turns praying, until the rooster crows, then they stop, but they immediately have to set off on the road again; in this way, it always takes more than ten days of eating wind and sleeping in the dew to reach the destination of "collecting water." On this day of arrival, although they are exhausted, their hearts are still as pious as when they came. They forget the hard work on the road and the mental depletion; what they hope for is raindrops that are more precious than gold.</p>
<p>After arriving at the mountain, they then go to each temple to burn incense and fulfill their wishes; no matter how many temples there are on this mountain, none can be missed. The magnetic bottle in their willow basket, after the incense is burned in each temple, fills the bottle with water, pastes a red paper seal on the bottle mouth, and offers it in front of the statue of the god; the work of going up the mountain to "collect water" is considered to have come to an end here, and they only have a short rest once on this day night. The next morning, they get up early again, burn incense in front of the statue of the god again, and then carry the water bottle down the mountain; every night they still kneel and worship as when they came, until they are ten or twenty miles away from the place where the "altar is set up," then they find a temple on the road to stop and rest, and one of the three "water elders"—the name after "collecting water"—goes back to report to the "chairman" in advance, and then returns to the temple where they stopped, this is called "reporting water."</p>
<p>When the "chairman" receives the letter that the "water collection" has returned to the altar, his joy at that time is as if a heavy rain is about to fall, and he immediately gathers the villagers to prepare to welcome the water. The ceremonial guard of this welcome water is simply no different from that used by the imperial ministers in the late Qing Dynasty. When starting on the journey, everything appears orderly. The forefront is led by many young villagers with "divine sticks" to open the way; their spirits are high and they walk forward, and hope is spread all over everyone's face. Following behind is a large flag team, with colorful bucket flagpoles several feet high, carried by three strong villagers, like the large battle flags in previous marches, standing high in the air; ordinary villagers and women, seeing this flagpole from a distance, move the prepared incense table out to wait like rushing to a fire. After the flag passes, there is a gong and drum team, and a divine pavilion; this divine pavilion is carried by four dragon-like "boys," and their walking pace is like ducks, slowly progressing forward step by step. In front of the "divine pavilion" there are also four yellow horses, with yellow paper strips tied to the saddles, fully displaying the color of theocracy. The general old gentry, each holding a wooden boat in their hands, and lighting a stick of incense in one hand, with solemn expressions on their faces, follow the "divine pavilion" in turn. Four or five thousand villagers, in a mighty manner, progress towards the road of hope, and there is an indescribable joy on everyone's face, but no one dares to easily open their mouths to laugh.</p>
<p>This kind of "water collection" team, like an expeditionary force, meandering for dozens of miles, walking on a road, is indeed very majestic. They walk with a frog-like pace, and in this way, they have to walk to the temple where the water is released, which is one or twenty miles away, before stopping; then the "chairman" leads the entire congregation to perform a kowtow ceremony to the "water bottle," and then places the water bottle in the "divine pavilion" and carries it back along the old road. The farm households along the way all light incense and candles and kneel to worship when the water passes.</p>
<p>Within seven days of the water being invited, the "chairman" and the "water elder" take turns burning incense and praying every day. On the third day of the water's arrival, the villagers from each village gather in front of the altar to burn incense and worship the gods, and they also bring more than a hundred pounds of flour as gifts to comfort the "water elder"; this is called "descending incense."</p>
<p>The period for setting up the altar is mostly stipulated as seven days. On the seventh day, the "water elder" puts the water bottle in the "divine pavilion" again, and they beat the gongs and drums and surround him; they set off from the place where the "altar is set up," parade around each village for a week, and then return to the temple to cancel the altar, this is called "swimming water."</p>
<p>During this altar setting period, if there is indeed a heavy rain, then the villagers' rejoicing will naturally go without saying, and the names of these three "water elders" will be passed down forever.</p>
<p>Corrigendum: In last issue's "Visit to Zhoushan," the sentence "The poor him has no bourgeois arrogance" was misprinted as "Two petty bourgeois people met"; also, the three words "Only Life" are a mistake for "Literary Theory." We hereby correct it.</p>

<h3>Oneness of Spirit and Flesh</h3>
<p>— Lu Xiaoxian</p>
<p>Humans are emotional creatures, and this is what distinguishes them from other living beings. "Love" is an instinct endowed to mankind, and it comes with a newborn's first cry. Although there is evil and ugliness in human society, we must not therefore obliterate the other side of "humanity's ultimate beauty"—love.</p>
<p>A person who enjoys "love" feels an unusual fulfillment in their own life, a great sense of meaning in life, and sees everything outside the individual as vibrant with the heat of life; majestic mountain ranges, rushing torrents, twinkling stars, beautiful clouds, birdsong, the fragrance of flowers, all sway in the current of love, the world is only filled with light and beauty. Conversely, an unfortunate person, deprived of the warmth of love, will inevitably fall into an abyss of sorrow and pain, and the joy of life will be lost, and the world will be filled only with objects of hatred—truly like withered grass without sunlight, a soulless walking corpse.</p>
<p>Although, love is not the whole of life, and there is even less reason to make love supreme, to regard love as an affront to life, as the great enemy of life, is the teaching of ascetics. It has no real psychological or physiological basis. Zhang Junmai said: "However, I believe that when a person comes into contact with something other than himself, whether what he comes into contact with is a thing or a person, inevitably there is an impulse to possess it, which is called selfishness, and once selfishness is mentioned, it is known that it is not noble or sacred. Therefore, Mencius's comparison of men and women with food and drink is truly appropriate..." I cannot agree with this.</p>
<p>The sexual relationship between men and women is natural, and I not only feel that love is natural, but I also advocate the oneness of spirit and flesh in love.</p>
<p>Love is the expansion of the instinctual desires of human beings. The impulse of love between the sexes cannot exist in the beginning apart from the impulse of reproduction. To speak plainly: Love is the sublimation of desire. The ultimate goal of love cannot be separated from the purpose of life between the sexes.</p>
<p>The scope of love is varied: love of parents, love of children, love between the sexes, love of friends, love of nature, love of living things, love of mankind, love of justice, love of country, love of beauty..., but the reason why love between the sexes is different from other forms of love is that the former must be between a man and a woman of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>It is said that Lin Hejing lived his life with plum blossoms as his wife and cranes as his children, but Lin Hejing must have been a psychologically abnormal person. In recent years, there has been a prevalence of homosexual love among young people: two men, one of whom turns the other, who is slightly feminized (whether in character or body), into the opposite sex, and they fall in love with each other, or two women, one of whom is slightly masculinized, compares herself to a man and passionately loves the other. But this so-called homosexual love is ultimately an abnormal behavior, not the norm, it is only akin to an illusion, or a temporary anesthesia, like a soap bubble in a child's eyes, once it bursts, it will suffer a very serious disillusionment and sorrow. The tragedy of two lesbians fighting on the shores of West Lake the year before last: A detailed analysis of Tao Sijin's reasons for killing Liu Mengying from their diaries reveals that they were a pair of love-sick homosexuals. At the beginning, the warmth of their mutual feelings was no different from that between the sexes, and they had even made an agreement not to marry for life, but eventually they both suspected that the other had another lover, and they became jealous of each other, and turned from love to hate, and even turned against each other with knives, and the staging of such a situation was due to the disharmony between the spirit and flesh of love.</p>
<p>From the above understanding, we can prove the inseparability of the spirit and flesh of perverted love. Therefore, we always believe that all unreasonable marriages, whether old-fashioned marriages or marriages between men and women of disparate ages, are contrary to the naturalness of love.</p>

<h3>Biography of Einstein (5)</h3>
<p>— From Wood</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Einstein began lecturing as an associate professor at the University of Zurich in the winter of 1909. The two years after his graduation were spent as a wanderer, and then he spent seven years as a small clerk in Bern, and now he is a professor at the first university in Switzerland, which is certainly something to be happy about for him. However, as an associate professor, his actual income at this time was about the same as it was in Bern. Not only that, but his position was not elevated, so even after moving to Zurich, his lifestyle was the same as it was in Bern, with no changes. However, it was here that his second son, Eduard, was born.</p>
<p>Before the lectures began, in September 1909, the German Association of Physicists and Physicians held a conference in Salzburg, and Einstein was also invited to attend. This was his first meeting with many scholars in Germany. His lecture was entitled "On the Development of Ideas Concerning the Nature and Structure of Radiation." His theory of radiation was: from the mechanical ether hypothesis of mechanics, to Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light, and then to Lorentz's electron theory; and Lorentz's electron theory and the principle of relativity are not contradictory, and according to this, the absolutely stationary ether that exists at the root of the theory does not exist in reality; on the one hand, according to Planck's radiation theory, because the emission and absorption of radiation is discontinuous, so radiation is a wave of the ether, so he thought that in the vacuum where there is no ether, it is a discontinuous particle that propagates; he described the so-called light quantum theory.</p>
<p>At the University of Zurich, in addition to the obligation to compile lecture notes, Einstein also had the affairs of the classroom, but the material income was about the same as in Bern, which was of course not satisfactory. At this time, the University of Prague invited him to be a full professor, so he accepted the invitation and left Zurich. In the winter of 1911, he moved to Prague with his wife and two sons. Later, he corresponded with Dunbai, a assistant to Zhunma Feiersheng (now a professor at the University of Leipzig).</p>
<p>Prague or Praha is now the capital of the Czech Republic, and was once a city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its university was established in 1348 by the German Emperor, King Charles IV of Bohemia, and is the oldest university in Germany, but later most of the residents here were Czechs, and there were many intellectuals, so there were constant conflicts with the powerful Germans; in 1879 and 1880, the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach was the president of the university, and opposed the replacement of Czechs with German professors, which led to a great dispute, so, in 1882, the university here was separated into Czech and German departments.</p>
<p>The one that invited Einstein was of course the German department of the University of Prague after the separation. Although this university was smaller than the University of Zurich, it was quite interested in Einstein, and he often mingled with students personally, and got along well with Professor Lanpa, the director of experimental physics, who was also a colleague, and his life was very enjoyable. However, after living in Prague for more than a year, he returned to Zurich. But this time it was not at the University of Zurich, but as a full professor at his alma mater, the Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>The recommendations of Poincaré of Paris and Madame Curie were very powerful for this position. In the autumn of 1910, Poincaré accepted the invitation of a popular science lecture hall in Berlin called Urania and lectured under the title of "New Mechanics." He said that now, a great revolution has taken place in mechanics since Newton; he described Einstein's theory of relativity, which is now called the special theory of relativity. As a result of this lecture, people began to know Einstein's name. Ten years later, when Einstein was even more famous, Moszkowski, who wrote his biography and dialogues, wrote: Until now, Einstein's name has not been mentioned in popular lectures, etc., so no one knows him except specialists. Poincaré was fifty-seven years old here, and died two years later in 1912, he had not yet seen Einstein's great discoveries after 1913, but he saw Einstein's talent and wrote a letter of recommendation to Zurich with Madame Curie's name. It said: "Mr. Einstein is the most creative person, I have only known him until now. He is still young, but he is already a first-class scholar of the modern era; and he occupies a superior position among the first-class scholars. What is particularly surprising is that he can stand on new concepts and easily draw all conclusions. He does not rely on any old principles for physical problems; he sees through all the possible scope of thinking, and in an instant, he forms a prediction of new phenomena in his heart, and he will prove it in the future. His true value will be increasingly developed in the future, and the university that gets him will surely gain fame in its relationship with this young scholar."</p>
<p>The year before returning to Zurich, in 1911, Einstein delved into the beginning of the most famous and great research in Prague. That is, in June, he completed the paper entitled "On the Influence of Gravity on the Propagation of Light." As mentioned earlier, in 1907, in the "Yearbook of Radiology and Electronics," in the final chapter of the comprehensive report that recorded what is now called the special theory of relativity, he expanded the principle of relativity on the system of equal acceleration and described that this naturally leads to the theory of universal gravitation. Four years later, he drafted this paper.</p>
<p>In this paper, according to the principle of equality, that is, according to the equality of the gravitational field and the acceleration field, he described the matter of replacing one's position in it, the inertia of ability, that is, its weight, the change in time in the gravitational field, that is, the change in frequency, and the change in the speed of light in the gravitational field, and the resulting refraction of light rays. All the questions raised in the above-mentioned yearbook four years ago were actually discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>This paper records the refraction of light rays passing tangentially through the sun, that is, the so-called Einstein effect, which is 0.83 seconds, but in 1916, under the most rigorous theory, it was proved that this is exactly twice as much as 1.7 seconds. Moreover, in the famous eclipse observation in South America and other institutes in 1919, its correctness was proved by Davison, Eddington, and others from England. Since then, the name of Einstein's principle of relativity has become noisy in the world. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Nobel Literature Prize Winner Pirandello to Visit Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>The Italian playwright and novelist, Pirandello, since winning the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, has long been speculated by those American filmmakers skilled at catering to the general audience's psychology, that they would certainly try to win over Pirandello and adapt his works for the screen. Now, as expected, this world-renowned playwright will soon be coming to Hollywood this month.</p>
<p>This writer's works have also been introduced to a considerable extent in China. He was born in 1897 in Sicily, Italy, and served as a professor at the Higher Normal School for Women in Rome, while also engaging in literary creation. He has written numerous novels, poems, and plays, and is a very popular writer in his home country.</p>
<p>Pirandello believes that life is fundamentally a sea of suffering and emptiness. Therefore, Pirandello's works are filled with pessimism and world-weariness. The Nobel Literature Prize Committee, when awarding the prize each year, aims to bestow it upon the best idealistic writer. Therefore, almost none of the naturalistic writers who exposed reality or the old realist writers have ever received the prize. However, it seems quite difficult to find wholesome, positive, and idealistic writers these days, so this time the prize had to be given to the pessimistic and skeptical Pirandello.</p>
<p>Last December, when Pirandello went to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, to receive the nine million prize from the estate of the dynamite king Nobel, several Hollywood film companies had already sent representatives to discuss film scripts with him. Pirandello had never paid much attention to screen work, but this time, due to the sincerity of the American filmmakers, who not only appointed representatives to negotiate but also urged him daily by telegram or long-distance submarine telephone, he had to agree to temporarily use one or two of his works as a screen experiment. If it succeeds, he may adapt all of his personal works into film material, or simply write a purely original film script; it is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Pirandello has someone he also calls a "spiritual" son, who is now in charge of managing his business affairs. This son has a doctorate from the University of Paris and has written a book about Pirandello, so the playwright considers him a most trusted person. Now, the person negotiating with the film companies is this son, representing Pirandello. If an agreement is reached, he will send his son to Hollywood first to make preparations, soliciting and inquiring whether the other party can realize his plan, and then Pirandello will set off for America.</p>
<p>According to Pirandello's intentions, the first work he ideally wants to adapt for the screen is his most proud masterpiece, "Six Characters in Search of an Author." If Hollywood allows him, he is willing to play the role of the author in the play, because he says that he is both the actor playing the author and the author of the play, so only he knows why the six characters want to find him.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The First World War"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The First World War</p>
<p>——Da Guangming——</p>
<p>Twenty years after the First World War, with the Second World War looming, American filmmakers with a sense of justice, due to the cruel lessons of the First World War, cannot help but express their憂悒 on the eve of this war, and thus produced "The World Moves On," "Highlights of History," and this "The First World War."</p>
<p>It is gratifying that "The First World War" is made from the montage of newsreels. As we now recall the situation during the Great War, this serves as a good review of our textbook. Here, the editor Laurence Stallings very solemnly Montages the old newsreels and explains the situation at the time in a sentimental tone. There are no vulgar love entanglements in this film, only a straightforward presentation of some historical facts worth reviewing. However, we must point out that Laurence Stallings does not provide an essential explanation of the First World War. Like most humanitarian filmmakers, he is only repulsed by the inhumane cruelty of the war and shouts out anti-war slogans. Moreover, like Edvin Careve, the author of "Highlights of History," he believes that the war was entirely the fault of a few warmongering military men. Thus, he writes from the Iron Chancellor Bismarck of Germany, and introduces generals such as Hindenburg and Foch, as well as the English King George, the Russian Tsar Nicholas, and so on. They were warlike, they treated war as a child's play, and so after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Serbia, an unprecedented massacre began. Furthermore, in Chapter 10, it is written that after General Foch commanded the war, the war became more intense, with charges, artillery bombardments, and piles of corpses, while the English King and others constantly awarded iron crosses to their soldiers, driving more soldiers to the battlefield to serve as cannon fodder; the result of the war was a graveyard of crosses. Yes, he hated the war, and when each warship was sunk to the bottom of the sea, he almost explained it in a wailing tone. Especially after the end of the war, after a short period of peace, he shouted loudly: "Now, look at today!..." Various countries are again expanding their armaments and preparing for the Second World War..." This heavy sadness and憂悒 remain in our memories after leaving the theater.</p>
<p>However, we cannot but provide an appropriate explanation; we must explain that the essence of the outbreak of the First World War was by no means merely the warmongering of the generals, but rather the highest stage of capitalist development, for the sake of invading colonies and dividing the world market. The real instigators of the imperialist war were the supporters of capitalism. The First World War happened in this way, and after the market was divided, there was so-called peace. However, after 1928, the world economic panic began. This panic wave invaded every corner of the capitalist world, so in the West, we most clearly heard the foreign minister of the Hitler government shouting the slogan of attacking the Soviet Union, and in the East, we most clearly saw that Japanese imperialism had already begun its war of aggression and occupied the Northeast. Yes, peace is the preparation for imperialist war. In the West, all the masks of peace have been torn off, the strengthening of armaments, the arrogance of the Fascists, especially Italy's military actions against Ethiopia, all the crazy states are nothing but the eve of the war. Just as this film unfolds in its last part, political or military leaders of various countries are giving speeches inciting the war, and even the Roman Pope has become the most active figure in advocating war.</p>
<p>Then, in this situation, how will people cope with this suffering? That is to say, how will the masses, who will be destroyed by this more scientific and more cruel Second World War, especially those of us in the Eastern battlefield, oppose and eliminate the war? This cannot but remind us of the enlightenment given to us in "Resistance," that only by transforming imperialist war into revolutionary national war can permanent peace be guaranteed. Similarly, in this film, the author has not forgotten the historical facts of the Russian Revolution. He tells us that in 1917, in the active progress of the war, the revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky, who appeared on the screen, established power after October and immediately made peace with Germany.</p>
<p>However, Laurence Stallings, in his work, ultimately contains many shortcomings. On the one hand, he has indeed neglected the rampant Japanese imperialism in the East, the cries of Pan-Asianism, he has not heard. Similarly, he also expressed subjective contradictions: he did not forget the establishment of the socialist country that accounts for one-sixth of the world, but he paid no attention to the widespread conclusion of non-aggression treaties. Thus, like "The World Moves On," he equated the consolidation of armaments to strengthen defense for the improvement of human life with the expansion of armaments by imperialism. Thus, Stalin and Mussolini or Hitler and others appeared on the screen as instigators of war.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this work does not deeply touch on the causes and nature of the war. However, at present, even humanitarian anti-war films can continue to appear in the United States, which still makes us feel gratified, and therefore we still attach great importance to this film. As for the technical aspects, the author has been able to repair the old newsreels to such clarity, and the montage has achieved great success, which is indeed not easy to do. Audiences who are concerned about the Second World War, I would like to introduce this film to you.</p>
<h3>Review of "Diary of a Bachelor Girl"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>“Biography of a Bachelor Girl”—Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>The female painter Marlene is suspected of having some extraordinary charm because she paints portraits of many celebrities. Therefore, the young writer Cord encourages her to publish her life's romance in his weekly magazine.</p>
<p>The politician Nolan, after seeing the record in that weekly magazine in the hands of his fiancee, Celine, is extremely anxious, fearing that the love history between himself and Marlene will be revealed, which would hinder his future political activities. Therefore, after his plan to beg the author to show mercy in his writing fails, he asks the big publisher, who is also his fiancee's uncle, Mr. Jin, to devise a threat.</p>
<p>At this time, Cord and Marlene are recuperating in the countryside, writing this unpublished "Diary of a Bachelor Girl" in a loving life. Nolan and Mr. Jin and others have all come. In the process of negotiation, Mr. Jin also develops some affection for her, and Nolan, while his fiancee's supervision is slightly relaxed, again proposes to her, causing a dispute between men and women that makes it impossible for us playwrights to handle it properly.</p>
<p>Just as Marlene is about to go to Hollywood at the invitation of another old lover, a musician, Cord, by mistake, burns the original manuscript of the diary, and he and she fall in love again.</p>
<p>Such a mediocre and old-fashioned story should, according to common sense, be linked together more smoothly. However, the playwright here makes a mess of things with draggy and pointless writing. For example, at the beginning, there is no need to force the plot to unfold on a ship from Europe to New York, with a disturbance about the customs ban on entry. In the middle, such as the meeting of fiancees, fathers-in-law, mistresses, and the mistress's new lover, there should be some drama to be made, but it is messy and perfunctory, and unnecessarily, the awkward placement of another musician's proposal being rejected before and suddenly invited after. Due to insufficient character portrayal, the protagonist of the so-called female painter, this amorous woman, is painted as neither a painter nor an amorous seed. As for the forced characterization of the young writer Cord as a socialist, and yet he is so bored that he is writing love histories for women, and smoking with his mistress in the shade of the stream, these are all meaningless acts.</p>
<p>The director Edward H. Griffith may have felt the boredom of such a plot, so he tried his best to use the so-called relaxed tone and vulgar jokes in the performance. Thus, starting from Ca ting, there are politicians with grotesque appearances that make people laugh, and musicians with wide hearts and fat bodies like big-bellied merchants. In the dialogue and in the expressions, the so-called humor and slapstick are used everywhere without principle. But this ultimately cannot cover up the emptiness and boredom of the content.</p>
<p>In the performance, it was still Marlene in the plain countryside, sitting around the stove, asking Cord to tell about his life. He says with heartache that his father was a mine worker and was killed in a strike, and his understanding of society. This scene has a considerable effect. But how out of tune it is in the tone of the whole film! If the author had emphasized the description in this aspect, and infused some tragic flavor into the mediocre romance between men and women, would it not be more deeply moving? The actors Ann Harding and Robert Montgomery, due to the lack of personality of the characters Marlene and Cord in the play, did not achieve much in acting, but Edward E. Horton, who played the politician, succeeded in conveying some of the flavor of the villain.</p>

<h3>National Call (Bordertown) (9)</h3>
<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>Del had no choice but to agree. They sat in Johnny's car. He was driving slowly. He drove slower and slower. It seemed that they had been driving in the wilderness for a long time. Johnny suddenly stopped the car. He said, "I have to tell you something. I can't bear it any longer." Del had previously sensed that Johnny had some intentions. At first, she was unwilling to consider it. But now she had to consider it, because Johnny had begun to express his love. And his attitude was very passionate, which Del had not expected. Johnny said, "Del, I love you. The first time I met you in court that day, I had no right to say such things—I was a poor man, incapable of anything. But now, I have money, I am rich, and I also have plans to make money. I am already a man of status. But what is all my hard work for? Isn't it just to tell you this?"</p>
<p>How to answer his words, how to explain to him the reason why she could not marry him? But also to avoid hurting his feelings, because he was indeed a very lovely person. But because he was... She decided to deal with this matter lightly. So she said, "You have been very romantic lately, but it's a bit too much. As for marriage, it's out of the question, we shouldn't even mention it." Johnny asked strangely, "Why?" His stupidity, at this point, annoyed her. Furthermore, she had to go to the banquet, and it was already very late, which made her even more anxious. So she said angrily, "Why? Because you are not of my kind. You are a barbarian."</p>
<p>Johnny gradually understood. Resentment gradually swelled up. He shouted, "Not of your kind, huh... you think..." His attitude made her even more angry. She had never been treated like this by a man. She wanted to explain things more clearly. She said, "I thought there were still two words in the world, equality. Now please don't make me angry anymore." Johnny listened, and could not help but be furious. He grabbed Del's shoulders forcefully, turned her body to face him, and then shouted, "Equality—why didn't you say it when I first kissed you? That night when you went out with me, you clearly treated me as an equal. I believed you loved me. So you were just joking with me, having fun. Once you have had enough fun, you don't care anymore. And you still say that you are a civilized person, and people are barbarians. I tell you! I won't take that!" Del struggled to get his hands off, and cursed, "Let me go, you dirty, filthy beast! Let go!" She opened the car door and jumped out. At this moment, a car came towards them, driving very fast. Johnny clearly saw Del in front of that car, and he could not help but shout wildly, "Del!" But it was too late.</p>
<p>This is the last scene. Johnny Ramirez, in the chapel in Sonora, confesses all his sins to the priest. The murmur ceased. The priest recited the prayer of atonement in a loud voice, and finally ordered, "My child, you must walk the path of peace in the future, and not forget the merit of prayer." Johnny finished his confession and came out, and his mother followed him out. As they walked to the chapel door, the priest had also come out. He asked Johnny, "Where are you going now, my child?" Johnny said, "To where I should go. Back to my hometown. Back to the place where my ancestors, my race, and my people live."</p>
<p>Now, if you want to find Johnny Ramirez, the former master of La Rue Ranch, you can find him in the fields of the Mexicans. He is wearing overalls, a large bamboo hat, holding a cultivating machine, moving forward while singing. He understands what the priest told him before, to seek peace in his soul, not to envy vanity, not to harbor ambition, what is the meaning, what is the good. (The End)</p>
