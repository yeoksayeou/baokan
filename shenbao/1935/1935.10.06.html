<p>我國關稅收入據廿四年度。全國預算所列爲三二六·三六一·四〇〇元對歲入經常總額之七六一·九七〇·一九九元占百分之四三。而弱對支出之債務。費二七四·八〇三·二七九元則占關稅收入百。分之八四而强可見關稅在我國財政中實占首。要地位稅收盈絀。關係甚鉅年來百業蕭條農村破產進出貨。量本無前此之旺盛而偷漏。之風變本加厲其先商人不過夾帶隱匿冀輕負担。如財政部修正進口稅則。暫行章程第一條第二節規定設商人不肯出示眞正。發票而又無理由陳述足使海關認爲。滿意則海關對於該貨所征稅額該商卽。無抗議之權蓋爲防杜匿稅計也。然匿稅雖有損稅收與偷稅又不可。同語乃自北方發生戰事之後秦榆。走私驟盛近則竟有恊和商棧之組織專事私運向。關外運出者爲白銀現洋及中。央中交等單元鈔票向關內運入者爲麻紗砂糖。人造絲等類結夥。武裝遇海關緝私人員卽武力對抗某次曾爲破獲。其私運人造絲致關員被毆垂。斃海關巡艦向烟台洋面緝私歸途又爲日憲兵。藉詞扣留蓋烟台與大連僅隔一衣帶水。靑島本有其潛勢力偷運習。爲故常如妨礙其行動自必爲所。嫉視矣厦門一帶雖海關緝私。努力而販私團體有組織有背景有保。鏢關艦追緝出槍抵抗自本年一月至九月十九日進口洋。糖僅四千九百餘包爲數已微而。皆轉銷漳屬厦門既不產糖又無存留則。每月消費之糖二千餘包從何而。來此又不問而知其爲偷運也汕頭有。日籍台民五百餘人自粵省徵收。洋米豆豆餅人造絲等以特稅並統制白糖。水泥肥田料各項貿易捐稅既。重物價昻貴台人見有利可圖採辦大宗米豆豆。餅至汕頭傾銷不納稅捐價格自廉各。業存貨遂大受影響矣。</p>
<p>夫中國之關稅大多。數爲內外債及賠欵之擔保品稅。收如絀何以盡其義務若一方破壞其稅收。一方責令其整理舊欠中國雖重。信究無點鐵成金之術故防止走私不僅爲我國。當局所應致力之問題而。與此有關之他國如欲增進對我外。交關係亦有予以恊助之必要也。</p>

<p>記者與王紀元君既於二十二日下午抵漢口、翌晨渡江至武昌、訪省政府秘書處馬滿飛孫幾伊二君、二十四日下午五時、承馮若之介、謁省府主席張岳軍、暢談一小時餘、記其談話要點於次、</p>
<p>記者以此行目的、在一觀蜀中大體情形、故先請張氏指示四川最近情况、張謂四川目下進步之障礙已漸芟除、一切漸上軌道、深望將來得有外資流入、則一切建設、更易進行、繼詢以鄂省近狀及施政方針與武漢市况張答、自蒞鄂以來、業已比六個月、無日不於（一）敎育人民、（二）組織人民、（三）培養人民生產能力、三點着力、冀達「人盡其才地盡其利」之目標、所苦者、鄂省自經廿年大水之後、元氣未復、本年復經巨大之水災、災區之廣、更較民二十爲甚、全省七十縣中、爲水災所波及者四十九縣、此外遭早災者亦有七縣、災民共計七百餘萬之多、在此情形之下、不得不於各方面力事撙節、寬籌振欵、以救災民、各項建設計畫、限於財力、未能貫澈者殊多、目下省府經費、每月支出、爲數僅八萬元、吏員薪俸、原頗微薄、近又减低一成、生活更形淸苦、以故欲在致界上謀事者、羣趨首都、次之、則赴江浙等比較上豐裕之省、來鄂省謀事者、須抱犧牲精神、故甚少云、至武漢商情、實甚艱難、民二十水災後、中小商店被淘太者頗多、目下存在者、均比較上有力、故從表面觀之、不景氣情况、殊爲深刻、</p>
<p>鄂省本年水災原因、有謂由於長江之汎濫、有謂由於山洪暴發、有謂由於漢水陡漲之結果、言人人殊、據張談此次水災之成因以及關於治水與救濟災民之方策、略謂鄂省本年災形所以特別重大由於長江及漢水同時水漲所致、欲治水患、非從長江及漢水上游設法不可、諺云「長江爲川之利、楚之患、」以四年來之情形觀之、殊信而有徵、但鄂省水災之治本方策、非鄂省一省所能爲力、須由中央通盛籌劃、設計施行、而最要緊者、莫若仿美國「密西西秘」河之治水辦法、以人工在上游設置蓄水之處、使下游各地之水不致陡漲、漲亦不致太高、目下武漢商業、因受世界經濟不景氣之影響非常疲敝加以大水爲患、農村經濟、亦復大受打擊、預計今冬、都市商業、農村經濟、必較往年困難、故於救濟災民一層祇能注重工振、而冬振尤關重要、不能不預為之謀、鄂省財力有限、深望中央加以補助云、</p>
<p>又詢以鄂省工業、在最近將來、有無促進之可能、張謂中國為農業國、欲使中國現代化、誠非增進工業不爲功、惟鄂省礦業不多、棉業則向稱發達、故個人經濟政策、原在先促進植棉與棉織工業、使農工均受其利、無如漢口紗廠、目下因受外貨傾銷之影響、四家之中、三家均先後停業、縱欲促進紗業、亦非易易、言下深致感慨、最後、復言交通與水利一切物質建設之先决條件、蓋若不開發交通、工商業均無從促進、若水利不講、則水患頻仍、農村經濟建設、亦雖期其基礎羣固、因此中國欲圖建設、在今後交通與水利方面、最需專門人才云云、</p>

<p>上海網球會爲提髙滬地人士對於網球興趣起見、特趁全運會各地網球好手蒞滬之際、邀約川　馬華　滬地名將、作表演審於康悌路該會球塲、昨爲第一日、計有男女雙打各一組、男子單打兩組、事前預料慕名而來者必多、但天不作美、於午後一時餘、細雨濛濛、因之觀衆寥寥、爲數不足百人、亦云少興矣、比賽結果如下、</p>
<p>魏氏姊妹輕取趙黎</p>
<p>二時正、女子雙打首先開始、對壘者為滬魏祖同魏麥谷、對川趙蘊華黎玉萍、四川小姐、球技尙佳、止反手亦有可取、但魏氏姊妹合作純熟、抽壓均佳、尤以攔網見長、每能制敵牝命、鏖戰結果、趙黎僅於第二盤中取得一局、魏氏姊妹以六比、六比一連勝兩盤、</p>
<p>王錢合作力抗德陳</p>
<p>繼之登塲者、爲王文正錢耀彬對德孚陳志强之男子雙打、預定秩序、德孚本與球大玉李惠堂搭配、惟李君今日將代表港足球隊出戰西捕、爲養精蓄銳計、故改由陳志强替代出塲、開賽之初、雙方勢均力敵、各失發球局、惟因德陳從未台作不免時有錯誤、予對方進攻之機會、而王錢亦不肯放鬆、大施神勇、連下五局、以六比一勝弟一盤、第二盤起、德陳組鑒於第一盤之慘收、心有不甘、故奮勇對抗、連取二局、王錢深知對方亦非弱者、急起直追、扳回三局、德陳報　顏色、連拔三城、以五比三估先、其間雙方知兵相接、你來我往、精彩百出、掌聲不絕、王錢見局勢危險小心應付果然亦勝三局、反以六比五超前、下局德孚發　、迭成和局、此後八比八而九比八、王錢始終佔優、但至此王文止略現倦態、反被德陳　氣呵成三局、以十一比九勝第二盤、後因天時不早、尙有兩組單打表演、故和局而終、</p>
<p>卡爾生再敗邱飛海</p>
<p>老邱耄矣、無能爲力矣、昨戰身强體健之卡爾生、失敢固在意中、上塲時、老邱尙能振作有爲、　力對抗、其最拿手之底綫長抽，深入兩角、時陷對方於絕地、故以四比三局領前、嗣後即現疲憊、被卡爾生連取一局、以四比六失第一盤、第　盤老邱先取一局、繼即奔跑無力、出球軟弱、野球迭見、幾全無管束力、卡爾生則愈戰愈勇、操縱自如、遂以六比二再勝第一盤、</p>
<p>徐煒培小挫柯拉沙</p>
<p>最後一塲、徐煒培對柯拉沙、是時雨勢漸大、觀衆星散、但仍冒雨舉行、兩人球藝、在伯仲之間、而徐煒培略勝一籌、故結果徐以八比六、六比三連勝兩盤、第一盤徐先以三比一、四比二佔先、後柯追上三局、反以五比四超出、徐發球造成半手、柯再以六比五領前、最後徐振作精神、速下三局、遂以八比六勝、第二盤柯先以三比二局居先、後因天色漸黑、草草應付、遂被徐連勝四局、反以六比三再勝第二盤、</p>

<p>上海隊先開球、上五分鐘相持、互相監視頗嚴、不易得手、英軍異軍突起、麥克法倫奮勇當先、孤身在環攻中直搗上海隊球門、迅不及救、應聲人網、張榮才徒喚奈何、</p>
<p>錦順畢竟可人</p>
<p>雙方戰攻甚烈、曹秋亭連次帶球深入無如英中衛綫墻　堅固、不易衝破、常被截回、孫錦順振臂一呼、接得李義臣傳來之球、用力一蹴、入綱迅不及救、孫鐵腿畢竟不凡、</p>
<p>麟經輕輕中的</p>
<p>英中堅麥克法倫、屢次勇冠羣衆雄、孤身斬關深入、幸有馮運佑坐鎭後方、應付裕如、不易達到目的、連被截阻、英軍此時只顧猛攻、疏於防衛、由梁樹棠暗襲左翼、遞球賈幼良、賈帶球猛進、底綫傳中、　　經趕上輕　一　、球已入網、上半時畢、二比一上海佔先、</p>
<p>錦順兩度立功</p>
<p>易地而戰、英陸軍勇敢當先、出全軍猛撲上海陣綫、馮江兩人、竭力應付、多因中衛綫稍弱、致常被英軍深入內衛綫、幸張榮才頓肯　牲、連救險球、不顧一切　環境奮鬥大得觀衆贊許、然英尼斯因此後衛空虛、戴麟經運球，衝破英軍中衛綫、即　入後衛終、係錦順猛迫一脚、球出如矢、射入網中、</p>

<p>— 森</p>
<p>一件簇新的淸潔的衣服穿上身，沒多少日子，脫下來細細一看，別的地方都還可以，只有「領」和「袖」最髒，媽媽洗時特別用力，所以損壞最易，這當然也是意中事了。</p>
<p>本來，「領」握着全體的樞紐，以維護其主體爲唯一的責任，「袖」隨着萬能的雙手爲轉移，勞働特多，無怪它們最易損汚了；惟其最易損汚，職務自然最重！</p>
<p>一件衣服是少不得「領」和「袖」這兩樣東西的。甚至一個組織，一個團體，都少不得「領袖」，更推而至於一個現代的國家，更少不得一個優良傑出的「領袖」，爲人民的領導，以維護其唯一的主體—國家—好像一件衣服一樣，，雖損汚而至破壞的程度，也默默無怨言哩！</p>
<h3 id="c171">阿比西尼亞與阿都瓦之役 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>這幾個月來，瞬際間的大事，無過於意大利，與阿比西尼亞的衝突了。</p>
<p>我們對於意大利的國名很熟悉，因爲有一位名聞全球的怪傑，黑衣宰相墨索里尼統治的綠故。阿比西尼亞的國名，郤很陌生。它是一個很古的黑人國家，位置在菲洲的東部，又稱爲伊索比亞，是菲洲三個獨立國家中的一國，有面積一百十二萬方公，里，人口約一千萬，有豐富的礦產，和宜於耕種與牧畜的土地，蠟·象牙·咖啡等輸出量很大。現在的國王是罕爾·賽拉西。阿國的地位雖然臨近紅海和印度洋，但是完全與海洋隔絕的，因爲它的四周都被英法意三國的屬地所包圍，從這裏我們也可想像它的國際關係的複雜了。</p>
<p>現在意阿糾紛不但無法解决，而且更加深刻化，大戰已經發作了。意軍已有二十五萬人駐紮在阿國北部意國的殖民地伊里脫利，以及阿國東部與東南部的意屬索馬里蘭。至於阿國呢，對於意國的侵略壓迫，　表示了很勇放的態度，阿國國王屢次表示阿比西尼亞必須保障它本身的獨立，他說，「我們寗可爲自由而死，不願爲奴隸而生」！這是多麽勇敢的話啊！</p>
<p>阿國是有希望的。雖然它已被放在宰割的俎上，但是在三十九年前，（一八九六年）曾給意國一個巨創，只要能够保持以前的光榮，作最後的奮鬥，卽使滅亡，也是非常光榮的。</p>
<p>三十九年前，現在叱咤風雲的墨索里尼只有十二歲，正在從他做鐵匠的父親那裏灌輪到社會主義的學說。阿都瓦之役，就起於此時。當時意軍共有二萬人，內中一半　本地土人的援軍，分左右中三隊進兵，還有一隊在後面接濟？每隊有一將軍指揮。先是意軍占着對峙阿都瓦的兩個山脊，後來阿兵前仆後繼的衝過來，意軍的大砲竟不能阻止阿兵的前進。結果意軍全軍覆沒；二位將軍，二百五十二名軍官，四千五百名兵士被殺，四十五名軍官，一千五百名兵士被擄，所有的大砲，完全被阿兵奪去了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們聽了這故事，作何感想？</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>油炸燴，是敏兒每天早晨吃早餐時常用的一種菜，因爲他覺得它是鬆脆而又很香的。</p>
<p>但是他很喜歡吃，而不知道它是什麽東西做？又怎麼會鬆脆的？去翻翻書，也沒有關係它的記載。</p>
<p>「爸爸，油炸燴是怎樣做的？你可能吿訴我嗎？」他很快的跑到他的爸爸那兒，去問他。</p>
<p>「是不是油炸燴嗎？你有沒有注意過街上店裏做的時候？」</p>
<p>「我沒有注意過，以爲這是很容易，沒有什麽價値的。」</p>
<p>「那是你的過失，我時常對你說：「無論什麽事都要注意，尤其是極小的事情。」你旣是不知道，我來吿訴你：</p>
<p>油炸燴是用麥粉做的，但怎會鬆脆呢？是把明礬和小蘇打配合而成的，鬆脆不鬆脆足一種化學變化，是很玄妙的，大概你不會懂的。</p>
<p>預備冷的淸水一碗，把明礬溶解在淸水裏，再把小蘇打，食鹽也溶在水裏，用棒攪拌，使它們完全溶解，這時碗裏就有許多泡沫，把泡沫吹開，碗裏的淸水便變成乳白色了，這乳白色的水叫醱水。然後把極細的麥粉，放在淺盆裏，把醱水灌進去，不停的用手揉拌，這時麥粉已經變成糊狀。然後放在板上，做成帶狀，再把刀橫切成小條，把兩小條相疊，用木棒輕輕一壓，用手指把兩端　起來拉長，然後絞成螺旋條，放在菜油鍋裏煎，不一會，它就膨脹，而成焦黃色的汕炸燴了。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，明和小蘇打是什麽？」</p>
<p>「明礬很像冰糖，它能使汚水淸潔。小蘇打是帮助消化的。」</p>

<p>— 歐陽古</p>
<p>賣報童子是我們最可憐的小朋友！他們自幼失了學，把報賣給人家看，却看不懂自己賣的報，　然他們也很願意讀書，但祗可惜沒有人敎，要進髙貴的學校，那是根本也談不到的了，現在可有一件很好的消息，想小朋友們很願意聽聞與贊助的吧！那卽是本埠威賽路小菜塲東首，居然也有「賣報兒童工學團」的校所成立了，校門口的白油綠底的標語：寫着讀了書，就會看報，你們願意讀書的都來！與你們把報賣給人看，自己也能看報嗎？確是都很醒目的標語。</p>
<p>說起這所小小文化細胞的創設，原來乃由該地賣報小朋友的合羣努力，起初他們是在一個弄堂內露天上課，有四個識字的賣報童子做小先生，不到二星期，已經讀完四冊老少通，後來各賣報童子，因爲工作的時間與氣候的關係互相衝突，他們早上須待十點鐘後，方才賣完報，晚上五點鐘以前，就要販報來賣，所有空暇的時間，正値旭日品掛的當兒，於是由他們向該區鄰近識字學校要求資助，租賃了六塊錢一月的那所校屋，裏面有三張八仙桌，舖上長板，凳子是臨時租用的，地圖；黑板鉛粉　都是捐來的，書籍則由識字學校分發，那四位小先生，依奮輪流盡義務敎，他們靠賣報吃飯，每天求些新智蔽，就豈不是工學兩全了嗎？而且在這所小小工學團的校所裏，他們旣可以拿空暇的時間安心讀書，到現在他們的範圍，更愈擴大，團員增加到七十幾位，辦理兒童工學團的小先生有七個，接着髙級市民課本，亦將讀完，有很多的團員，已能學看自己所賣的報哩！</p>

<p>— 敎書匠</p>
<p>猩猩是猴子一類的東西。牠在動物之中，要算是最聰明的。智巧雖不及人，爪牙却比人類生得利害。人們要捉活猩猩，赤手空拳，休想捉到。於是便利用猩猩愛好模仿的天性用計去捉牠。</p>
<p>有一回，有個旅行客人乘轎游山，行到半由，客人下轎步行，閒看風景。那幾個轎夫溶得休息一下，坐在山石上打盹。不料幾隻猩猩，趁着人們不防，從樹上跳下來，有的攢進轎裏坐着裝作客人，有的學着轎夫，抬着轎子，歪歪斜斜的亂跑亂跳。等到人們覺醒，早已把轎子丢得老遠。</p>
<p>其中有個轎夫計上心來，隔了一日，約同幾個獵人，帶了酒肴，抬了幾乘轎子，轎門上做好活鎖，打從原地經過。故意停下轎來，喝酒解悶。停了一回，故意把酒肴留在那裏，四散游覽。</p>
<p>那些猩猩見了人去轎空，酒香撲鼻，便奔躍前來，把餘酒殘肴，吃個酩酊半醉。有的走入轎門，或坐或蹲。有的便來把轎門帶上，抬着行走。</p>
<p>伺候着的獵人們忽然一聲吆喝，猩猩們嚇得倉皇失措，有的打倒，有的逃走，惟有那坐在轎裏的猩猩，門又打不開，跳又跳不出，只好給獵人們甕中捉鼈了。</p>

<p>一陣凉颼颼的風兒，突然飛來，報吿我們「秋」到了人間。這是多麽値得驚喜的消息啊！蔚藍的天空，襯着魚鱗也似的雲朵，愈現出它肖然的偉大，我們的胸襟，也就暢闊了。</p>
<p>秋蟲啷啷地噪着，好像及時讀書一般；小朋友；這樣好的天時，可以不努力讀書嗎？機會萬不要錯過，稍一蹉跎，砭骨冷的冬天又來了，薰蒸熱的夏天也來了，怪悶人的春天也接踵而至；快快把住着這可愛的秋天，努力讀書。</p>
<p>怎樣讀書，才可收到效果呢？我們讀了一篇文字，至少要和說話，作文，寫字三部連絡起來；這樣，書讀了，會說得出，書寫出來，並能創作出來。如果只做到哼哼唱唱的工夫，，那讀書不過是消遣吧了！</p>
<p>讀書最大的目的，在『探求事實』。我們讀書的時候，必須將書中的糖菓找出來；書中的糖菓，我們吃了，有百利而無一弊，愈吃得多，滋味愈好；滋味愈好，愈要多吃；多吃了，受用無窮，就成功社會上有用的人。</p>
<p>平常讀書，應該靜讀，不要朗讀；無論在實用上效率上，靜讀的價値，髙方朗讀，這不可不注意的。小朋友們，大好的秋天到了，快快努力讀書啊！</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>有一隊商人帶了許多貨物，乘了一隻海船，飄洋過海的去做賣買。他們起初是很和睦的，可是，後來，有一些人主張　到北洋去，他們說：那邊的生意很好做，一定可以賺到許多的錢；另有一些人却主張開到南洋去，他們說：那邊　土人很需要他們的貨物，出價旣髙，貨又容易脫手，一定可以賺　許多的錢。兩方面起初是言語爭執，後夾是動手相打；風湖越弄越大，結果，舵工丢下了舵，篙手摔下了篙了，一窩蜂跑十甲板，加入戰團，混戰在一起。他們又因爲要增加鬥爭的力量，各各跑到貨艙裏，打開預　出賣的酒，咕嘟咕嘟地喝下去，喝了以後，再跑到甲板上來厮打。他們一個個拚命厮打，都要想把對方打死，誰都一步也不肯放鬆，郤把那大家所托命的船兒，任它隨風漂流，任它去觸着暗礁。</p>
<p>正在他們酬戰的時候，天氣忽然變了，空中烏雲如墨，電光像　綫一般閃射，狂風怒吼猛雨傾盆，正在漂流的船兒，給顚狂的巨浪一忽兒拋到空中，一忽兒厭到浪底，可是這些醉人，還在酣鬥！突然好像天塌地倒一般，起了一聲　響，船觸礁了！船頭上給礁石觸破了一個洞，水爭先恐後的滾湧進來……</p>
<p>這時，有一個沒有喝酒　靑年，看見這種情景，急忙跑去用兩手掩住洞眼；可是這樣湧的水，靠一個人的力量，那裏掩得住，於是他大聲喊道：『船要沉了！大家停手！…快來…快來相救……』可是這醉人們正在甲板上打得起勁，哪一個　睬他！</p>
<p>不久，水愈來愈多，淹沒靑年的滕部了，他愈加着急，大喊道：「你們再不來相救，船馬上要沉沒了！……」可是這些醉人們正在甲板上打得起勁，哪一個理睬他！</p>
<p>靑年最後的「沉沒」兩個字剛剛喊出，水已經淹沒他的胸部了，他慘属地喊道：「你們…你們…再不…船…馬上…』他喊到了這裏，水灌進了，他的喉嚨，同時船就向水裏沉下去，沉下去……，甲板上的人們也沉下去，沉下去；可是他們除了已經打死的之外，活着的人，依舊扭結在一起，拚命厮打……</p>

<p>他聽完之後，開口說道：「你要是像我一樣，做了一頭傳信鴿，那麽你就不會受到這一切的煩惱了。我們只知旅行，這就是我們的生命，我們也有我們的愛，但我却不知道我的父親是誰。我們一天一天的打破了空氣，穿過了空間，瞧着那髙山和平原，都羅列在我們的脚下，我們所呼吸的，全是天察中的淸明之氣，而不是地面上的濁氣，我們飛時，像一支箭，直到我們的目的地，不會錯誤，這是我們的娛樂也就是我們的生命。我在一天中，所經行的路，人類在十天中也趕不上我那麽遠。』</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，立時勇敢起來，向他說道：『先生，如此說來，你是一頭流浪的鳥啊！』</p>
<p>傳信鴿答道：「這一件事情，我又不用担心，我是沒有祖國的；我只知道三件事：我的旅我的旅行，我的妻子，和我的小兒女。我的妻子在那裏，那麼我的祖國也就在那裏。</p>
<p>「但那掛在你頸子上的，是什麼東西呀？那好像是一張破舊的縐紙。」</p>
<p>傳信鴿吐着氣答道：「這是很重要的文件，我這回是到白羅塞地方去，帶一個信給那著名的銀行家X氏，使幣價跌去法郞七角八分。」</p>
<p>我歡呼道：「好呀！你的生活眞好極了，而那白羅塞城，我想一定是一個値得去看看的城市，你可能帶我同去嗎？我旣不是山烏，那麼我也許是一頭傳信鴿吧。」</p>
<p>傳信鴿道：「你倘是一頭傳信鴿，那麽我剛才曾啄過你，也得啄你還我一下。」</p>
<p>「先生，我可還給你的；我們不要為了這些小事情爭執起來，你瞧晨光快要透出來了。大風雨已减退了。請讓我跟着你去！我已失敗了。在這世界中我甚麽都沒有；你要是拒絕我，那我只得溺死在這水落中了。</p>
<p>傳信鴿忙道：「如此很好，向前進行，快向前進行，只要你跟得上我，就跟我去吧。」</p>
<p>我向那母亲睡著的園子裏看了最後的一眼。一顆淚珠兒從我的眼中滾出來；當下就給那風雨帶去了。我展開了我的翅勝立時出發。</p>
<p>我早就說過，我的翅膀還不很强哩。那嚮道的傳信鴿好像潑風般飛去，而我跟在他的旁邊，不住的喘息；我打熬了一些時候，但是一會兒就覺得一陣猛烈的頭暈，幾乎要暈了過去。我放出一種軟弱的聲音，問道：「此去可是還有很遠的路麽」？</p>
<p>他答道：「不遠了，我們已在包葉德地方；如今我們只要再趕　百八十英里好了』。</p>

<h3 id="c193">狂歡與奇裝異服 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 似鴻</p>
<p>連日報黨：「今年的雙十節，廣東有什麽狂歡會的組織。」又有什麼「在雙十節停止取締奇裝異服……」。這，在這個年頭，似乎是很新鮮的。</p>
<p>不過，我總覺得這「新鮮」似乎出於常態，根本，在這國事多磨，世界危機日追的今日，不但可憐的中國人無從生歡，就是所謂以强盛名的資本主義國家以及其他一切弱小民族都在痛苦連天中。</p>
<p>「歡」字上面有個「狂」字，「狂」者，本是變態的形容，沒有「歡」而硬要「歡」，好比要死的人，到臨終時總是說：「我要活着」一樣。所以在　這第二次世界大戰將陷的前久，來一個「狂歡」，在要歡的人，也不算爲奇特。</p>
<p>有了狂歡會，自然對於「取締奇裝異服」要解禁了。要不然，一般小姐們穿了樸素的衣服，旣露不出玉臂，又坦不出酥胸，在狂歡的時候，多不够味兒！</p>
<p>可是，能參加狂歡會，能穿奇裝異服的究屬少數，廣大的，無能顧及這種事情的婦女們，不但不狂歡，不但不穿奇裝異服，連縐眉頭，當舊衣也來不及。</p>
<p>所以要狂歡的，只管去狂歡罷，要穿奇裝異服的只管去穿罷，反正這些都不過是最後的興奮而已。</p>
<h3 id="c194">她的出路 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>本刊上期載有鐵懷先生的何處是她的出路一文，內容是記載杭州「新聞界中人漿中學敎師」的甲男，誘姦乙丙丁三女的糾紛，至今乙女因被遺棄，以致「無路可走」，這種現象，在現在社會中正是層出不窮，所以已不是「畸形社會中的某一種畸形現象」而是已成爲現社會中相當普遍的嚴重問題了。如不久以前曾哄動一時的北平滕邊情殺案，以及山東敎廰某督學的桃色案件等等，其情形雖不盡同，但其發生的根源則相類似。因此我們對於這許多事實有詳加分析及批評的必要。</p>
<p>造就這件事實的主角，無欵的是甲男，他利用了中學敎師的地位，「而且敎的是女學生，他就因此結識許多情竇初開的靑年女子；又因爲他上課時善扯談，喜詼諧，頗得若干妙齡女郞的好感。」於是一再誘引女性，首先在家裏安放了「一位如花美眷」的內小姐——非正式的甲師母，做他生殖機器。以後又向乙女花言巧語，一再獻媚，當乙女大腹便便的時候，更發現了甲與丁的關係。條這種男子，利用他社會上的優越地位，在「愛」的面具下，一再蹂躪一情竇初開的弱女，」已足令人駭怪。更何况甲男身爲「中學敎師」，他非但不負起指導學生的職責，反而利用這種機會，進行其誘奸工作。這不僅摧殘女性，而且是摧殘女子敎育，使反對女子敎育者更將有所藉口，這是最使我們切齒痛恨之點。</p>
<p>至於被蹂躪的乙丙丁三位，對於後二者的情形，鐵懷先生並沒有詳細揭露，因此我們只能專談乙女的事實。乙女是個父母早喪，又無兄弟的孤伶女子，僅有的小叔父，因爭奪遺產，有傷家庭情感，而致失所憑依，在這四顧蒼茫之中，甲男首則帮助爭奪遺產，繼則一再援助，病時伴送入院，病後留家調養，並且代爲介紹職業。這樣，一位閱世未深而又「舉目無親」「病苦顚連的少女，自然很易　人甲先生的奸計之中。所以我們說乙女士的被　，確實情有可應。</p>
<p>不過乙女士當一感激涕零，　　肉體一的時候，至少疏忽了下列兩點　第一，乙女士早已知道丙女士與甲先生同居多年，而且已有孩子，在這時假首先應該考察甲丙的關係究竟如何？倘使甲丙　到那時爲止，尙有愛情維繫；那麽乙女士决不應該爲着自己的情慾，而以內女士爲犧牲，倘使甲丙之間，已經沒有愛情存在，亦應該在甲丙關係淸算以後，然後實行同居。第二，乙女士旣在自己大腹使便的時候，還發見了甲丁的關係，那末甲先生的態度，已經洞然若照，這時乙女士不應該再存心觀望，而應該爽爽快快淸算自己的關係，但乙女士尙夢想着「丁女事件的解决，好使腹中孩子，有個名正言順的父親，」因此甲先生出走，竟好像出乎意外的那樣，由這二點處置失當，因此乙女士現在的「無路可走」自己亦不能完全卸責。</p>
<p>不過這裏我們應該認識淸楚，事實的發生，雖然由於他們四人，但是所以容許這件事實發生，却不得不推究其社會的根源。在這男性中心社會中間，男子一切都佔優勢，所以甲男竟能一再誘惑女性，而尙逍遙法外，在乙女方面，她的被人引誘，首先經濟不能獨立，社會又不給以任何保障，因此不能不以婚姻爲職業，作爲保障生活的惟一辦法。又如她在被棄後，不切實的向社會求出路，只是發着「會有人肯娶嗎一？的歎息。這也表示她的「戀愛就是生活，戀愛就是一切」的根本熊度。</p>
<p>因此我們要根本消滅這種多角戀愛的糾紛，使男女雙方都向正常的道路發展，只有在這男性中心社會根本改革，女子解放的阻礙完全消滅以後，單純的在個人的週圍兜圈子是始終不能得到徹底的解决。不過話又得說回來了，在社會制度的潎底改革實現以前，我們總不能叫乙女士一天一天等待下去，我們要在可能範圍以內，尋覓一條較合理的出路。按照乙女士現時的情形，消極方面，首先應當設法淸算她同甲先生的關係。寗可把他當做敵人看待，澈底的淸算一下，　不要存絲毫幻想，沿襲過去錯誤的路綫。在積極方方面，是要爭取社會上的獨立地位，首先應該在經濟方面謀得相當獨立。在現社會要想找尋職業，一般說來，是非常困難，不過乙女士决不要因爲自己是「初中畢業生」而寒心，在中國社會中，女子能受到初中敎育，眞是百不獲一。即使　的「沒有門路一，找不到適當的工作，就做小販苦力，也比賣淫式的寄生生活光明一點。這　特別應該指出乙女士念念不忘的「重行嫁入」，這條出路，不過是重覆了過去的錯誤。倘使乙女士繼續以婚姻爲職業，或把戀愛作爲中心生活，那麽誰都不能保障第二次受騙的不會重行爆發，所以「戀愛」成「結婚」，在此地應該作爲火要問題，應岔把自己大部份精力放在社會事業上面，尤其是喚醒還在夢囈中的其他少女，爲着解除自身和一切　壓迫同胞的束縛，而來改革這種不合理的社會制度。假使乙女士能够决心的朝着這個方向前進，那末雖然中間要經過許多磨折，但是我敢斷定，乙女士的前途依然光明；而且有一天自己鄙棄這種恥，辱的虛偽的「溫柔好夢」會在廣大的姊妹羣中，獲得更偉大的安慰！</p>

<p>（八）</p>
<p>一夜的驚慌，忠貴老太太嚇出了病，忠責少爺雖沒有病，顯然兩頰消瘦了。近村的親戚，與族內人，就是鄉長也都過來慰問探望。</p>
<p>——老太太你須得吃點金銀花湯，這裏是一包人參，你呌丫頭煎前。要不然，我想還是許堂弗送送他們（鬼）。那位女親戚低　說着。</p>
<p>男客都在客廳里。鄉長拱着手，笑着說：</p>
<p>——恭喜！恭喜！忠貴兄！總算一物勿動，至於老太太的受驚慌，那是請先生（郞中）來看一下馬上會好。</p>
<p>——託福！託！福！諸位來剛好，我本要請諸位來商量商量</p>
<p>忠貴少爺所要商量的事有兩種，一種是：昨晚剛起火時，有一個强盜趁勢逃下山來，被保衛團捉住，現在尙捆縛在樟樹下，不知如何處置才好。另一種是，昨夜火後，焚毀民房七八家，難民成羣，又不知如何處置最妙。</p>
<p>關於强盜一事，大家都異口同聲地說，這個非拷問不可，以免此後禍患。至於難民到有點難辦，大家都思索着。吃過了十盤「盆的點心，火腿　子也解了不少，還是得不到好辦</p>
<p>——這件事慢慢商量，在村上多難民是不好現象，總之，設法使地方上有秩序，不發生禍患才是。」大家吿辭而出。</p>
<p>河中的冰已變成一塊塊，冰塊上酒滿了焦灰。岸上一片火燒塲，雖然火已熄滅，靑烟尙在迷漫着天空。烏黑的棟樑横直或倒垂，瓦片與斷磚裝扮成了廢墟。有人發現一個人已經被燒死從瓦磚堆裏搗出來，衣服頭髮什麽都沒有，只是烏黑黑的一段。</p>
<p>—是誰？」母親問。「那一定是佑福嬸嬸，可憐，這樣燒死了。」她拱起手向那段焦身拜了幾拜。掉着眼淚，對立福嫂說：「老同伴裏，多少年來總是很好的，不想她竟這樣的死……我曉得有點不對，「澎」的一聲響，那是菩薩預報我，這樣看看，我們怎麼不要拜菩薩呢！」</p>
<p>—什麽菩薩不菩薩，我不肯，要是他有靈，那爲什麽不保佑我們不燒過呢？」</p>
<p>—大娘！你別這樣說，現在我們弄到這步田地，全靠菩薩來保佑了。老天爺，難爲她不懂事，你是寬宏大量的！」嫂嫂剛要回嘴，只見梂樹上抽吊起一個人。小尼子來報吿，說是要打强盜。硬拉了修珍去看。那强盜的兩隻大母指被繫緊了兩條麻繩，兩隻脚沒有着地，又掛了兩塊石頭，整個的身體筆直的一條，在懸空動着。忠貴少爺的宇下人，喝醒了燒酒，坦着胸，拿了一根樹枝拼命地敲，敲幾下，問一聲：</p>
<p>—你說，你們那個領頭的是誰？」</p>
<p>强盜不作聲，再拷一陣問：</p>
<p>——你快說，你們那個領頭的是誰？」</p>
<p>强盜還是不說，起初亂呌　嚷，後來漸漸變作「唔唔」地哼。</p>
<p>忠貴少爺命令下來，說是非要他說不可，不說就不打休。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c197">第四節　職業問題 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>婦女的職業問題也和參政間題及敎育問題同樣？就是婦女在職業上要獲得與男子同等權利的問題。這問題的內容，是要求同一勞役，同一報酬，要求保護母性，要求開放各部門的職業，要求撤廢一切職業上的性的差別待遇等等。關於這個問題，我國許多關心婦女問題的人曾經有過熱烈的討論。但一般的關於這問題的本質的理解，尙嫌不够。尤其到最近世界經濟恐慌勃發以後，這間題不單沒有得到進一步的解决，反而更引起了種種糾粉。因此我覺得這問題仍然有提出討論之必要。</p>
<p>婦女的職業問題，也是資本主義社會的生長過程中的必然產物。資本主義打破了封建制度以後，把一切社會事物都按照自己的需要而重新組織起來，使之適合於牠的發展。一輛火車的疾馳山頂和一架飛機的飛翔天空，固然是適合於資本主義的生長，一位政治家之僕僕征塵和一位農夫的碌碌田野也是適合於資本主義的發展。同樣的一位女職員在寫字間裏忙於打字或一位女店員在百貨店中忙於應酬顧客也就是適合資本主義的存在與發展。換句話說，資本主義社會的一切事物都爲着增殖資本家的利潤而很適合的被安排和被組織。所謂婦女職業者也爲適應這個需要而產生出來。</p>
<p>所謂職業婦女，廣義的說，是一切出賣腦力或筋力而換得生活之資的婦女。即勞動婦女也包含在內。但狹義的說，就是有多少事務或技術能力的被傭者及營業者而有獨立地位的女子。普通所謂職業婦女是指後者而言，故在此亦以後者爲問題的中心。</p>
<p>關於職業婦女所以產生的具體原因，可以從兩方面去觀察。一方面資本家的生產方法是不單需要大規模的經濟的生產組織，同時需要龐大的消費及流通機關，而資產階級爲着增殖其利潤，要用最敏捷最經濟的方法去運轉這龐大的社會機構。於是作事敏捷耐勞，而勞役條件極便宜的婦女技術者便成了他們的需要對象。他方面資本家的生產方法，漸次破壞了舊有的家族經濟及家族制度，同時把整個社會成員成了利潤生活者和工錢生活者兩種，而單靠工錢生活的男子，大多數都無力養活自已的妻或女，即其妻或女也非成爲出卖筋力或脑力的工錢生活者不可。由於这两方面的基本原因，職業妇女胡數目，日益增加，同時婦女職業問題便成爲主要的社會問題。更成爲婦女解放運，動的中心問題。</p>
<p>這問題在歐美，已於十九世紀初期爲一般人所注目的問題。在資本主義勃興時期，雖則一面婦女不得不向社會找尋職業，他面社會也需要婦女職業者，但婦女踏進職業界，經過了許多艱苦的國爭。男權社會對於婦女的最下層筋肉勞動，是比較　利的開放，但對於其比較高級的精神勞動，却不肯輕易開放。就是說，一位婦女當女工時，男權社會視爲平常，似乎婦女袛能做那種低級的工作，但若要去當女醫生或女敎員，那就提出許多的議論來，說，婦女有職業是破壞家庭的因素，是紊亂風紀的禍根，說，婦女是天性低劣的東西，不能勝任社會大事，諸如此類不一而足。最近在我國也有此種現象。就是爲排斥職業婦女，以最侮蔑的『花瓶』之名加於她們身上，尤其在這次廣州男女職業國爭中，男子方面提出社會風紀問題來排斥婦女。儘管這樣，資本主義的歷史使命是必然的打開婦女的職業前途。據最近的推算，全世界勞動婦女，約有一萬萬人，單單美國已經有一千萬人之譜，其中所謂狭義的職業婦女，至少要一〇％以上。又據「大正十年日本勞動年鑑」，日本的職業婦女（女工有三百五十六萬）總數有八十六萬五千〇七十八人。其中從事於醫藥界，敎育界，官廳的婦女有二十一萬八千九百五十八名，從事於商業界的婦女有六十萬五千七百九十三名，從事於產業界的婦女有一萬七百二十七名，從事於其他業務者有二萬九千六百名。這已經是十餘年前的數目字，現在當不止此。我國的職業婦女，雖沒有可考的數字，但其數目日益增大是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>在這樣職業婦女的數目日見增加的當中，資本主義社會發生內在的破綻。自一九二九年起爆發了無從挽救的世界的經濟恐慌。各國的資產階級爲着從恐慌的狂瀾中挽救自己，實行法西斯蒂的統制政策，這種政策便馬七影響於婦女的職業問題。就是說，各國都爲着緩和失業恐慌，驅迫婦女從職業塲所回到家庭去，而以男子失業者來代替，於是職業婦女遭受了空前的打擊。最近在我國也有人提倡婦女爲妻爲母的天職而排斥婦女職業，這也是整個資本主義經濟總崩潰期中，一般支配羣壓迫婦女的同一企圖！不過，我們要曉得，這是他們的最後的企圖，是一時的打擊。歷史是必然要打開職業婦女的前途，必然要解决婦女職業問題的。</p>

<p>人體之胃。爲消化食物之主要腑臟。因胃耆常分泌一種消化胃液。含有鹽酸消化素及酵素等質。食物由口内唾液與咀嚼作用而入胃。與胃液相混和。起一種發酵作用。卽可將食物消化。胃液之中。所含監酸。有防腐殺菌之功能。如有因食物而混入胃內之微菌。均可由鹽酸之作用。將微菌之生活機能殺滅。又與消化素起共同作用將食物中之蛋白質。變爲容易吸收之滋養品。營養人體各部。故胃酸之於身體。極有關係。但胃中監酸。有一定之量。若過多不及。皆足致病。尤以過多爲甚以胃酸過多。胃部卽時感疼痛。空腹之時。其痛尤劇。胃內則發生灼熱。有吐酸。嘈雜。噯氣等等現像。且以胃酸太多。食物容易消化。故食量特佳常覺腹飢。肉類最易消化。澱粉質較次。又以胃酸。刺戟作用甚烈。胃粘膜因受胃酸之過份刺戟。受損傷而成胃潰瘍病。逐致發生胃痛。因此凡患有胃酸過多症者。常成爲胃潰痬而致胃痛。其症狀中之最顯著者。在　後胃部作劇烈疼痛·常痛至一二小時。至嘔吐爲止。其痛熱有灼熱狀。有痙攀狀。常有嘈雜。惡心。噯氣。吐酸等症。漸至胃出血。卽由胃潰瘍而損及胃血管。致吐血便血等症。甚至續發胃炎。或穿孔性腹膜炎等里病。危害生命矣。</p>

<p>徵諸動物試騐，以嗎啡與蛙，則其大腦機能最初消失，次中腦，又次小腦，終則延髓之機能相繼消失。他如高等動物就中人類服用嗎啡或雅片至相當容受量，則其大腦皮質對於强大知覺刺戟之感受性先鈍麻，故能减低甚或忘却疼痛疲勞飢渴痛苦等之感覺，呼吸中樞對於刺戟之感受性亦减，如有咳嗽刺戟則能使消失，意識作用亦不减少，故不起睡眠，但迨後此等部分亦漸受侵害，對於外來刺戟之感受性漸漸遲鈍而起睡眠矣，斯時忘却一切不快感覺，精神恍惚，如遊華胥，自覺有一種不可名狀之愉快，嗎啡雅片濫用爲嗜好品者，恐即具此作用亦爲人們嗜好之一原因。</p>
<p>腦之無論何部分，均因鴉片或嗎啡而呈興奮狀態，有時起不整之概念，精神狀態變化迅速，呈一種發揚狀態，從前以爲此乃嗎啡雅片之興奮作用，然實非興奮，此乃因腦中各種機能失其平衡，概念界尙未受侵害而知覺感受性已減，外來之刺戟影響極少，因此惟概念界獨逞其作用而起槪念不整，現一種興奮狀熊而已，故此種情形，實係麻醉之初期。</p>

<p>前幾年上海的小報，乃至各個大報的副刋，差不多都可說是穿寗着鴛鴦蝴蝶派的彩衣的；流氓居士的趣聞，花國聞人的逸事，名伶。女優的照片，以及專談女人的小品和連載幾年的長篇章回小說，便人是牠們的主要內容。讀者呢，在電車上，在商店里，在遊戱塲中，在茶館內，都有他們的足跡。然而，時代趨「新」，鴛鴦蝴蝶派逐漸失勢了，首先是有些大報的副刋轉變了方向，新的文藝作品，雜感隨筆，代替了歇浦文豪和章回小說家的大作。最近以來，小報界更起了大的變動，新出的幾種小報的面貌與原有的小報全不相同：其內容有時事解說，學術講話，科學小品，社會評論，生活素描，各地通訊等等，簡直和新的小型雜誌一樣；所謂雜誌化的小報，眞可說是牠們的特色。同時，據說在已有的小報中就是那最著名的幾種，其銷售的數量也在逐漸减少，而以新的姿容出現的最近發行的幾種小報的銷路倒還不壞，這情形的發展是否還要引起那些舊有的小報轉變方向，實在是很難說的。於是，就有一些識時務的人說「今年是小報年！不錯，要說今年是「小報年」也可，但這「小報年」的意義安在呢？牠是怎樣產生的呢？人們却還沒有正確地回答這個問題。</p>
<p>某文學家說，由什麽年到「雜誌年」，再由「雜誌年」到「小報年」，這是表示中國是在由「大」到「小」的退後，表示一般中國人之善於「避難就易」，投機取巧：由此他更作出了「中國民族沒有希望」的結論。但我說這是一種形式主義的論調！我們對於問題的解决不能單單依據於問題的形式：近來有些書局所印的大批古書，什麽二十六史，什麼文庫（關於中國古書的），什麼珍本，其形式便是很龐大的，但我們却不能因其「大」就說它有進步的意義；同樣，以新的姿態出現的小報，我們也不能因其「小」就說它是退後的表現；主要地應該從其內容來評價。事實上，新出的所謂雜誌化的幾種小報，如從形式上來說，自然沒有那些大雜誌那樣的「大」，但由其內容看來，至少要比過去那些穿着鴛鴦蝴蝶派彩衣的小報進步得多了。因此，我們以爲「小報年」的出現並不是中國退後的表徵，更不能因此就說「中國民族沒有希望」，而是有其一定的進步意義的。</p>
<p>至於「小報年」出現的原因，當然不在於那些創辦新小報的人之「投機取巧一，而是有其社會依據的。這里我們可以提出幾點意見：</p>
<p>首先，我們認爲中國文化一般說來雖較落後，但近年來中國思想進步的速度却是很快的；從「五四」經過「五卅」到現在的過程，雖然僅只有十多年的時間，但中國思想的前進差不多已走過了西歐過去所經過的幾個世紀，這是誰也無法否認的史實。在這樣的思想前進之下，談女人講低級趣味的出版物已爲多數認眞生活的人所厭棄了，曾經使一些人覺得暢快的幽默文章也已走入「牛角尖端」了，現在盛行的是通俗的學術文字，科學小品，所謂「小報年一也就是在這個影響之下湧現出來的。</p>
<p>復次，小報的讀者主要的是中小商人，店員學徒，一部分工人和失業失學的靑年。他們當此經濟恐慌，生活苦悶的時代，隨着社會思想的前進，求知的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>願望必然也在日益增長的；他們就是化兩三個銅板買一張小報來看，也要下一番思索，在許多小報中，他們必要買那最能給與他們以有用的知識的，那些講低級趣味的東西必不爲其目前所需要。因此，才有人乘機出來創辦了一些新的小報，才有「小報年」的產生。</p>
<p>最後，所謂不景氣也與「小報年的出現有根本關係。因着工商業的不景氣，一般購買力的减少，所以就是要創辦一個小小的事業也非要有很大的資本不可；至於大的社會事業，那更是需要極雄厚的資本才能進行。這在文化界也是一樣，假使你要在目前拿出幾萬塊錢來辦一個大的報紙或大的書局甚或大的雜誌，那都是不見得就能辦得好而又能維持長久的；反之，倘若你以辦大報的錢去辦一個小報，以辦書局或大雜誌的錢去辦一個小小的周刋，那只要你能認淸讀者的需要，善經營，便是有好的前途的。——目前的時代是要以大錢辦小事業的時代。因此，有些聰明人便籌足了較大的資本來辦小報。事實上最近新出的幾種小報不是都有十萬八萬的資本嗎？</p>
<p>社會思想前進，一般讀者厭棄低級趣味，要求有用的進步的知識：這是使新的小報出現的客觀要求；工商業不景氣，只有以大錢辦小事業才可靠：這是新的小報出現的經濟條伴。「小報年」出現的總的原因卽在此。</p>
<p>至於最近以新的姿態出現的幾種小報之好壞，我們不願在此妄加評判。我們只說，必須要內容形式都　是適合於一般讀者需要的，才能有大的前途，如果有一個新的小報，能用上等的紙張，很科學化的印刷術印出很充實的內容，並以很低的價錢出售，那我敢說牠必受大家的熱烈歡迎與擁護而迅速發展；反之，假使只是在廣吿上吹牛皮，只是在報的形式上改良，只是用幾個不三不四的「名人」來號召，而內容却是充滿着落伍的思想，甚至依然講求低級趣昧，那我敢說牠是會要日益爲人鄙　而自趨死亡的。現在的時代不同了，就是小報的讀者也要看貨色，廣吿「名人只有在好的貨色下才能起作用！</p>

<p>— 囚亡</p>
<p>李惠堂住的是沿西　路一家很高貴的公寓。那是一座九層的巨厦，像筆管似的直冲雲霄，大門外一塊圓形的草坪，配着那樣一座巨厦就有點像痰孟那麼地細小。我循着草坪邊緣的汽車道上走着，大約有幾十步遠近，便到了一間廣大矞皇的客廰。名片拿進去不多時，電梯裏走出來了一位顧長的身子——穿着藍灰色的西裝的靑年，招呼我坐下，彼此間「閒話」幾句後，便「言歸正傳了。</p>
<p>「這一次如果不是代表香港，李先生怕還不會來上海吧？」我問</p>
<p>「說是代表倒不敢當，不過這次總算是難得的機會，一面可以就此探望多年不見的朋友，一面也好趁這機會和上海一般愛好足球的人士重行聚首一番。」</p>
<p>「到香港以後，對於足球還是像在上海一樣的感有興味吧？」</p>
<p>「那當然。一個對某種事物感到特別愛好的人，他是自始至終都不願意放棄那種愛好的，可况我從孩子時代起就已和足球「難解難分」的呢！」</p>
<p>「是的，所以不愧稱爲」球怪」！」我含着笑望他說：「那末，你從小踢足球直到現在，我相信總有許多爲一般的足球員所不能領會的心得吧？」</p>
<p>「這倒不見得。」他連忙接住我的話說：「踢足球也和做別的任何事業一樣，總要「持之以恒」才有進步，因爲這種東西並不是一天兩天就可以學到登峯造極的境地的。我的踢足球的技巧好到怎樣的程度，我自己是不敢妄自誇張，不過，我爲了它而吃過好多年的苦却是事實。記得我在小學唸書時代，人還祗那麽一點點高，可是對於足球已經是愛好到有時連飯都不想吃了，而且動不動就要和人家比賽，巴不得一天到晚都睡在球場歷。後來，因爲有許多孩子沒有我這樣的狂熱，不願像我那麼無休止的苦幹，於是和我踢球的人有時便减少了，甚至弄得一個對手都不剩的時候也成了常事。但我踢球的狂熱却並不因此而降低下去，反之，一個人也許踢得更得勁些，因爲一個人踢球最好的點是沒有人搶球，球能够老是在自己脚上踢着。」他說着，忍不住的笑了。</p>
<p>「當一個人踢球時，我想那是很費勁的吧？」</p>
<p>「不，一點都不費勁。遇到沒有人和我做對手時，我便把球對着墻上踢，像玩「回力球」那麼地踢過去，碰回來了再踢，週而復始，直踢到汗流浹背，頭上感到酸軟了才袛罷休。這樣，直到民國九年，才改踢大球了；那時我自信對足球已有了把握，所以練習的方法也比以前巧妙和實際些。」</p>
<p>「有人說，你踢球袛會運用右脚，左脚祗能帮助右脚的運用，射門是不行的，對不？</p>
<p>「沒有的事。照一般情形說來，踢球運用右脚的是比較多，左脚不能踢的也不是沒有，不過這都是吃了過於隨　不秀，雖然運用右脚時較多，但那也要看球的來勢怎樣血定。我自小踢球就練習兩脚齊一；不過初踢時左脚的確有點不及右脚靈活，而且有時球　到脚上來了，心裏想用左脚，可是右脚偏不聽指揮的上了前。後來給我想到了一個方法，就是不給右脚穿球鞋，如果它要上前，心裏覺着脚頭上輕了，便會記起了要用左脚；這麼踢了很久，逐漸地就習慣得兩隻脚同時都能運用了。有人說我祇會用右脚的話，那大概是看了我踢罰球」；因爲罰「十二碼」是非用右脚不行的啊！」</p>
<p>「對的，我看到你踢「罰一球」也多半是運用右脚；大概石脚比較有把握，不是每一次「罰球」經你一踢就進去了嗎？」我開玩笑似的說。</p>
<p>「這倒不是脚頭上有把握，」他一本正經地說：「光踢得好是沒用的，因爲守門的並不是死人，這在當時腦筋裏還要用點機智。譬如守門的人站在右邊，他的防禦却在左邊，因爲他預料到你，一定是乘隙進攻，但你如反其道而行之，偏向他站着的方面射去，他一定祇看到你脚起了就向左邊跑，却料不到你的球恰巧就在這時尚他右方空虛的地方長驅直入，等他再反過身來搶救已是「望球莫及」了。踢球是要有機智的運用，這是不會錯的；所以有許多人誤會我比球時不肯跑，說我踢的是「懶球」，這就是因爲他們沒有明白我當時內心所起的作用之故。」</p>
<p>「你踢球不跑是眞的，不過在當時實在也沒有使你能够跑的份兒。」</p>
<p>「對啊！我每次同人家此球，因爲稍有點名氣，一走上球塲就給人家「看住」了，要跑也無從跑起。不過我覺得踢球專靠跑也沒有多大用處的，最要緊的是要能够看到一個球的起落點。平常和人家比球，在塲裏絕不能專仰起頭看着球跟住它跑，這是白費氣力踢不着球的愚笨的舉動；頂好是要在球起時先預算它將要向某一方降落，便趕緊跑到那方面守候，這樣旣可避免敵人的注意，而自己脚頭又可有餘力接着踢起這將到來的求。我毎次同外人比求，人們總不大看到我滿塲跑着趕球，但球到了我脚上時却也不輕易給人搶去的。」</p>
<p>「不用說，這次全運的足球錦標，大概香港隊可以穩得的吧？」</p>
<p>「那却很難說！」</p>
<p>「照你的眼光看起來，究竟要算那一隊比較有希望？」</p>
<p>「大槪是！」他低着頭盤算了一會：「我想　不會出這四隊，香港，　南，華中，馬來亞罷！」</p>
<p>「馬來亞球隊踢得好麽？」</p>
<p>「可不錯：周為這一隊的人材差不多是集新加坡，甫洋，爪哇各地　倚中的上　球員在一起，所以踢起來是較有把　的。其次如華東，華南的人材，也都是一些久經　塲的戰將，勢力都還平均，將來交鋒起來究竟勝負誰屬，現在倒不易　測，至於香港隊，當然也還不弱，但至今還沒有機會和其他的友隊預賽過，所以也不敢把握可操左券。」</p>
<p>「還有華北，華中的球隊，看上去恐怕沒有什麼希望的吧？」</p>
<p>「華北的人材，個別的評論起來，倒也不算壞，如果以整隊的來說，似乎他們在聯絡方面還缺少訓練；華中當然又要遜一籌囉！總括的說，這並不是他們的人材不如華東華南或是香港，而是因爲環境關係，很少有和好的球隊比賽練習的機會，所以球藝的水準就很難得提高；至於華南，香港和華東的球隊，他們都有很好的機會常和外國球隊比賽，球藝就自然容易進步。不過，近年來的上海足球界却祗有比往年退化了。」</p>
<p>「據說你這次參加全運，除足球之外，還有網球；這網球是到香港以後才開始練習的麽？」</p>
<p>「不，我學網球是民國十六年在澳洲開始的；」說着他從口袋裏摸出一隻掛錶看了一下，接着說：「記得那是在出席日本舉行的遠東運動會以後，我們一行許多人，遠征到澳洲，在那裏碰見了林寳華，於是我的一點學習網球的慾望便一開始燃燒起來了。等到回國後，深得林寳華，邱飛海諸君的循循善導，和江道章。鄭兆佳的切磋琢磨，我對網球的興趣便愈益濃厚，天天練習不輟。迨至民國十九年，我和老江配搭得了全滬公開硬地雙打錦標，才確定了網球與我還有繼續結緣的可能，但在那年南下到香港時，我的網球還是不能十分惹起人們的注意；直到上屆全港公開賽中，一戰而取四年亞軍「芬查」，再戰之後，幾勝是屈盟主「林珍」，這才使一般人驚奇我的球藝進步得迅速，於是，埠際賽遴選委員的眼光便投向我的身上來了。」</p>
<p>「全運中的網球錦標，也可以作一下預測麼？」</p>
<p>「不用說囉！這回的錦標當然是上海隊的囊中物了。上海隊人材優越，香港隊當然不是他的「價錢」，我袛希望能在比賽時少吃幾隻「鴨蛋」，就是我們的福氣呢！」他不禁哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>我們說到這裏，他又像記起了什麼事似的，把錶拿出來再看了一下，熊度就沒有先前那麽從容，於是我連忙議相的站起來向他吿辭了出來。</p>

<h3 id="c207">美國購買白銀政策的觀察 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 林寳鐘</p>
<p>羅斯福自躍上美國政治舞台爲總統之後，對於其本國工業的凋落，失業工　的激增，社會的不景氣。想出各種補救方法，其中尤以購買白銀政策深得全國的同情。茲將該政策的性質及其對我國經濟的影響依次論述如左：</p>
<p>（一）　　白銀政策的内容。</p>
<p>該政策的要點爲（甲）白銀對黄金的比例應設法增加到佔其幣存底四分之一時爲止，換一名話說，卽白銀存底對於黃金存底的比例應爲一與三之比。（乙）美國財政部得隨時向國外收買白銀。收買白銀的程度直到白銀存底等於貨幣金屬存底的四分之一爲止。其價格（一）不得超過其爲貨幣之價格，（二）凡在一九三四年五月一日時已在美國本州的白銀，其買價不得超過每盎斯美金五角，換句話說，卽在美國以外的白銀或五月一日後運入美國的白銀，雖出五角以上之價收買，亦屬可能。（丙）如銀價超過其銀幣的價格，或者銀幣存底的總値大於貨幣用金銀總存底價値百分之二十五時，財政部長得隨時出售白銀。此外又准許財政部長發行銀券，其票面價値不得低於所購白銀的成本，並授權給財政部長：管理，調査或禁止白銀的收買，進口和轉運，頒布其所認爲實施此案所必要之條例。</p>
<p>如購白銀案認眞地施行起來，則査美國最近的準備金約有七，七七六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美金，以三分之一計算，爲二，五八九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美金，這就是白銀購買案卞所需白銀數量的價値。目前美國貨幣中僅有値八四一，〇〇〇，〇〇○元的銀幣，尙需一，七四　，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元　金的白銀，始可達到四分之一的比例。美國現在幣用的銀價格，每盎斯値美金一，二九元，是如許美金的白銀，其數量卽爲一，三五五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，這也就是美國擬買白銀的數量。此項白銀照每盎斯不超過美金五角的市價計之，約需美金六七七，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>（二）美國擬購的白銀的來源</p>
<p>美國擬購買的白銀的來源，約有下列各處：（甲）目下全世界白銀的過剩供給，卽在投機家手中者，約爲一萬六千三百萬盎斯，此項白銀，在理論上應該是最先出賣的。（乙）去年推銀產額爲一六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，今年則未能多量的增加（因爲白銀多爲他種礦產的副產品，產量一時不易增加），所以假定其爲一八〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，亦有爲美政府吸收最大部份的可能性。（丙）照畢德門國際銀恊定，印度政府在以後四年內每年可出三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯。（丁）上海底存銀，最大估計約爲六〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，內二六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯爲外商銀行所有，三四〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯爲華商銀行所有。</p>
<p>除此四項來源以外，西班牙及俄國，亦有出售白銀的可能，惟爲量甚微。然就這四大來源來考察，美國如只恃第一與第二兩萊源，則到年底止僅能得三二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，卽距其所欲收買之數甚遠，但事實上白銀所有者莫不欲待善價而沽，而中國及印度，若無政府設法阻止，亦無不售銀與美政府之理。故美國如决心要買銀，無疑地必　　國　印度之銀，尤其是中國，售銀的程度較任何國爲强。因爲中國是銀本　的國家，一般投機家惟恐白銀禁止出口，必極力設法運出待售，况我國歷年入超以白銀抵銷更屬合算，外商銀行在昔進銀成本極低，今得高價賣出，又有什麽不願意呢？目下白銀出超，依海關的統計已達三千餘萬盎斯以上，且仍在</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>繼續裝運出口中，因外商銀行已認白銀的轉運是一種極好的投資，自當源源地運出的。</p>
<p>（三）美政府實行此項政策的動機</p>
<p>至於美政府施行購買白銀政策的動機，據一般的觀察約有二點：（甲）用以打銷更危險的議案。美國本屆議會開會以來，銀派的議員，所提的議案，極其渲染之能事，十六比一，甚至十五比一的議案，亦幾有通過的可能，故銀派的勢力有操縱議會的權威。美總統對於此種議案雖難表示贊同，但因鑒於銀派勢力的强大，却又不得不設法敷衍，故核准一較有伸縮性的購買白銀案，以聯絡銀派議員的好感，其目的固不在大事增加銀運貨也。此種觀察為一般國外匯兌市塲中人的主張，他們認為購買白銀案正與以前的湯麥斯修正案及一九三四年的金準備條例一樣的作用，可見其目的為政治的，非為貨幣而採用這一貫的政策。（乙）用以促進物價的上漲或防止物價的下落。購買白銀票正和以前的黃金購買計畫一樣的性質，如依法執行，均足以助物價的高漲。黃金購買計畫在乎壓迫美幣的價格，因而抬高以美幣表示的物價，但事實上物價的上漲並不如黃金價格提高之速，故購買黃金的計劃遂歸失敗。至於此次購買白銀，增發銀券，雖可以增加通貨，抬高價格，但抬高價格能否如預算的有效，亦殊難逆料。但設使美國物價在本年下午期內不能向上升漲，或反有向下跌落之勢，則羅斯福為挽救物價計，亦未嘗不可利用此項政策，以濟周急。故施行此項政策，其動機或亦為防止物價之下跌的。</p>
<p>目前美國經濟的變動已經比從前平靜得多，勞工的風潮漸漸减少，工商各業得了政府的銀券，漸次有些活躍的氣象，多數失業的工人，也都已找到相當解决　包恐慌的方法了。但我國却受其害非淺，國內銀價隨其潮流而高漲，白銀不期然而然地向美國流去，其結果為物價依然迅速下落，工商各業本已很不景氣，再加上美國之提高一般人民的購買力，便紛紛的倒閉和崩潰，農村經濟受的影響更深刻化，農村的副產物可謂全部覆沒，假使這種情形老是這樣下去，中國的前途眞將不堪設想了！</p>

<p>— 育才</p>
<p>祖父在生時，是頂歡喜我這個沒有了父親的孫兒的。他勞苦一世，到了晚年，差不多也僅把他的希望安放到我的身上了。我有時也自覺我們一家中只有我才能酷肖祖父，我有和他一樣的猖介脾氣，並且自負着将来要如祖父一样幹着種種事業。</p>
<p>祖父因為負了祖孫三代十多個人衣食的重担，所以他直至呼吸到了最後一分鐘的時候，也還是像一個負重的駱駝，雖然他年事已太高了。他終年要在城里經營他的事業。一年中間也有三四回帶着傴僂的脊梁和蒼蒼的白髮從城里回到家里，作短期的休息。</p>
<p>祖父在家的個把月中，是我們一家頂熱鬧的季節了。他把城里帶回來的蘋果葡萄花紅等等的水果，一顆顆的分發給我們小孩。我們就提了蘋果的柄端，誇耀的滿街奔跑。有一回他也帶來了一個小汽鎗，晚飯後，老人家酒後興緻方濃，他愉快地眯細着兩眼，做着舉槍槍斃我們的姿勢，我們提着祖父的手狂笑了，祖父也快樂得流了眼淚。</p>
<p>我們的鄰居，有一位上了年紀的李姓老太太，她已是九十開外的人了，她的輩份比祖父還長一輩，可是她除了耳朶略有重聽之外，一　　還　　　　年。她常當在鄰居人家走動走動，尤其是我家，差不多每天總要來走一遭，談上幾句閒話，這樣差不多巳成了每天的功課。祖父在家時每餐都歡喜幽幽地喝上斤把花雕，和我們孩子們談着話兒。李老太這時又來做她的功課了，她見我的祖父在喝着花雕，她便挨着祖父旁邊坐下，祖父知道她並不歡喜喝酒，就揀幾樣鬆軟易食的食物給她嘗味，並且大聲的告訴她那種希奇的食物名字，我們　着看李老太那樣點頭點腦的神氣，大家又哄然的笑了。李老太看到孩子們歡樂的笑態，她就拍着祖父的背說：「志清，你總算好福氣，一對和合似的，兩個好孫子，將來還比你要勝呢！」祖父沒有什麽可說，他微微撚着鬍鬚，心頭的苦樂一起湧現在眼前，最後是漏出一聲長長的嘆氣。</p>
<p>祖父頂歡喜聽人家這樣的恭維，他又頂歡喜這霎那間苦酸的滋味的，他確實是將所有的希望都歸屬於我了。</p>
<p>後來我在祖父熱烈的希望中進師範念書，三年殘酷的敎育把我的童心完全刺傷了，我的性情突然由無邪的天眞變為冷酷的憂鬱，這幾年的生活實是戕賊我生命的最不幸的歲月。六月天，我拖着憂傷的身體回了故鄉，心頭永遠煩悶着，每天想效法詩人用醇酒來澆澆心中的塊壘，有時一個人躱在沒人的地方，捧着唐人的詩册高聲朗誦，讀到詩境凄然的地方，好像就是自己身歷其境了，不由得酸酸的熱淚吊滿兩頰。這樣，眞如患了歇斯底里病了！過幾天祖父照例回家歇夏了，但我的心，已不如孩提時候那樣的無邪，祖父這次見了我的情態，也不大怎樣高興。</p>
<p>一個下午，母親告訴我祖父悄然回城裏去了。這很使我覺得突兀。母親又關照我說：「祖父走的時候是非常不高興的，他說：「雲兒性情很高傲，這孩子沒大希望了。」他老人家似乎很生氣很頹傷呢！」</p>
<p>我聽了母親的話，憂鬱的心更憂鬱了，我想着老年的祖父為什麽這樣悄然的回城去，我又想着白髮蕭蕭的祖父是怎樣為了我而被痛苦嚙着他那數經創傷的心！我想着想着，我終於哭了！</p>
<p>我使最愛我的祖父也失望了！</p>
<p>高傲，祖父這樣批評了我，又這樣厭棄了我。就是那些所謂師長也曾這樣批評了我，可是我仍永遠高傲下去。我方脫離童年，即被高傲佔領了整個生命。</p>
<p>嗣後幾年中，祖父歸了道山，家庭又疊遭變故，那祖父挑了數十年的担子無條件的輪到我來挑了，可是我還是那一副高傲的脾氣。</p>
<p>「雲兒性情很高傲，這孩子沒大希望了！」祖父的這句話時常在我腦中縈迴，我時時體味祖父說這句話時的感傷神情。</p>
<p>人海裏又浮沈了幾年了，這幾年里，遭受了多少人世的白眼，遭受了多少冷酷的欺凌，我時時憤怒，可是我時時忍受，我把滿眶熱淚流向肚子里，因為我還要負起那重担！</p>
<p>我醫好了我的高傲病，我醫好了我祖父不能醫好的毛病，我不再高傲，我忍受着世間一切苦難，像我祖父生時一樣負着一副沉重的生活担子，踏盡那生活的長途！</p>
<p>祖父呵！你的雲兒巳不再高傲了，可是這孩子的希望又在那里呢？</p>

<p>在哲學上有觀念論與物質論的對立，同樣，在文學批評上也有觀念論的批評與社會學的科學的批評之對立形勢；而且，在文學批評領域內，觀念論還是自來就有很大的勢力的。從橫的方面說，所謂鑑賞批評，審美批評，印象批評，倫理批評，其各自雖都有一定的特點，但最後說來，都可說是屬於觀念論的文學批評的陣容的。從縱的方面說，自古代柏拉圖與亞里士多　的文學批評以來，經過中世紀，經過文藝</p>

<p>復興，再經過古典主義與浪漫主義，一直到自然主義以前的文學批評，都可說是觀念論的批評；換言之，自戴恩以前的文學批評都是爲觀念論的理論所支配着的。</p>
<p>事實上，柏拉圖是以虛渺的靈感去解釋詩的，他特別注意倫理的效果，所以他主張：「詩人之職能，詩人之特權，詩人之生存理由是提供非現實的事物給我們。」由這樣的見地所引導出來的他底文學批評，當然是很神秘的；他在不滿意詩人的時候，甚至在他底「共和國」中放逐了詩人，認爲「詩人是冒凟神的人。」同時，亞里士多德雖是被認爲「文藝批評之父」的人物，他底「詩學」的確也是誰都不能否認的古代最有價值的文學批評著作，但因爲時代的限制，若以近代的眼光看來，我們仍不能不說就是他那有名的「詩學」也不是怎樣完善的著作；而且，最後說來，他底名著還是偏於純技術的研究的，還是站在觀念論的立塲上寫成的。在「詩學」中，亞里士多德企圖以模仿本能與欲求調和的本能去說明詩之發生，這便使他開始走入了觀念論的世界。復次，他更從觀念論的見地論述敘事詩，悲劇，喜劇，希臘的讚美歌。例如，他在評論悲劇中，對於人物的性格就作了這樣的主張：（一）性格應是善良；（二）性格應有妥當性，如像男子勇敢雖然很好，女子勇敢却不好看；（三）性格應忠實於人生；（四）性格要是始終一貫的。由此可見他並不是從社會的見地客觀地去說明出現於劇作中的人物之性格何以是那樣的，其意義爲何，而是主觀地去規定人物的性格應該怎樣。由於他的主觀的觀念論的見地，在他的文學批評的原理中，也和柏拉圖一樣，注意倫理的效果；而且，他還在形式上作出了許多應守的規律，如人所共知的文藝復興以後的古典主義的「三一律」，便是從他底「詩學」中來的。</p>
<p>及至中世紀，人類因爲在自然經濟支配之下，生出了極端的孤立無助的思想與感情來，一切都只有希望上天和精神的援助。因此，這時人間的各種思想的表現都染着濃厚的神學的色彩，各種文學作品當然也都是表現着神秘思想與感情的。如所謂英雄詩，宗敎的道德的詩篇，騎士故事，聖書中的寓言，東洋的物語傳說，都是塗着奇蹟的神秘的顏色的。至於文學批評，當然也是神學的。待到文藝復興，這種中世紀的神學思想雖已結束，但隨着古代精神的復活，亞里士多德底觀念論文學批評復表現出了它底新的發展，所謂古典主義的文學批評，便可說是亞里士多德底文學批評底復活和發展。後來浪漫主義興起，雖然打破了古典主義的「三一律」，解放情感，發展個性，但也正因爲如此，浪漫主義的文學批評也是穿着觀念論的彩衣的。如　果　文學主張，華茲華士底文學批評，都是觀念論的。</p>
<p>由於上面的叙述，我們當可看到從柏拉圖和亞里士多德以來，一直到浪漫主義時代的文學批評，都是穿着觀念論的彩衣的。雖然在這中間，各時代出現的文藝批評是各時代的社會人底思想的反映，由於各時代的社會人不同，所以各時代底文學批評也各有其一定的特點，但最後說來，我們仍不妨斷言從古代一直到浪漫主義時代的文藝批評是穿着觀念論的彩衣的。譬如，古典主義與浪漫主義，從文學史的發展上來說，後者乃是前者底否定，它們底思想當然是不相同的；但在它們都是主觀地主張文學應該如此而不從客觀的社會的見地去評價文學一點上，在它們以「理性」或「感情」去說明文學而不能進一步去考究文學作品所表現的思想和感情之來源和其社會價值一點上，我們仍不妨說它們底文學批評同是觀念論的批評。</p>
<p>當然觀念論的文學批評並不是在浪漫主義之後就不存在了，反之，它仍繼續以各種形態出現於文學評論界中。不過，我們在此不想詳細叙述；在　　，對我們最重要的，是將近代主要的幾種觀念論的文學批評加以說明和批評。</p>
<p>一說到觀念論，人們總是不會忘掉黑格爾的。他不僅是觀念論的哲學體系底完成者，是觀念論哲學的最偉大的代表人物，而且是近代最偉大的唯心論的藝術觀底代表。他底有名的「美學」便可說是觀念論的美學的經典。在這中間，他對於許多藝術成品都有極精細的分析，但在最後，他總是以懸空的精神，觀念，靈感去說明藝術的。譬如，他對於中古峨特式建築的解說雖是非常精細，但在根本上他却認爲峨特式建築底一切特徵都是基督敎精神底表現。至於峨特式寺院何以會表現基督敎精神而不表現別的精神？中世紀底所謂基督敎精神是怎樣發生的？黑格爾並沒有考慮到這個根本問題。</p>
<p>在黑格爾之外，叔本華也是有名的觀念論者；而且，對於藝術，文學他還發表過更玄妙的議論。他根本否認藝術文學是人間社會的產物，他曾說就是宇宙失其存在時，音樂還是有的，只要有風。對於文藝批評，則他是因爲崇拜天才而將批評神秘化。他在論批評時一開始就說道：「下述批評才能的簡略註語，其大半爲的是表明世人未有這種東西。牠是一個極罕見的鳥，實則差不多與五百年出來一次的鳳凰一樣的罕見」。他既認爲批評是這樣神秘的，則他自己之批評文學當然也就很玄妙了。他除了神秘地稱讚許多天才底才能並浩嘆其遭遇外，結果是幾乎取消了文藝批評。</p>
<p>觀念論的文學批評底發展，到了唯美主義時，可謂是走到了極端。唯美主義的首要王爾德底文學批評，便是其代表。在王爾德看來，除了空虛，玄妙的「珍奇」，「魅力」，「美而外，什麽都是沒有意義的。他曾運用他底唯美主義的理論批評左拉，他說：「從藝術的見地看來，左拉底作品差不多全無價值，祇是零分。他作品中的人物都是頹廢而可憐的人們，罪惡之結晶的人們。這些人物的生涯是毫無興味的紀錄。誰能對這些人去注意呢？我們對於藝術的要求，是珍奇，魅力和想像，簡單地說，祇是美而已。」這實在是觀念論的玄妙理論發展到了極端的表現。在這樣玄妙的理論之下，注重「寫生」的自然主義者左拉當然是要遭否定的。</p>
<p>不過，在王爾德底唯美主義的文學批評之後，觀念論的文學批評仍是繼續以各種形態出現於批評界中。這裏我們可以舉出現今尚在流行的印象主義的批評來。所謂印象主義的批評，乃是否認一定的文學批評的基準，單憑個人主觀的一時的印象來評價文學。印象主義者抱着個人主觀的懷疑態度，不相信客觀的文學批評的基準之存在，根本否認文學之有實際的社會基礎。有名的印象主義者A，法朗士在其「文學生活」中說：「美學沒有確實的基礎，這是空中的樓閣。有人想使牠置基礎於倫理之上，然而所謂倫理是沒有的。社會學也沒有。……要建立批評，人們常稱說傳統和普通所承認的事。然而這些東西是沒有的。一般的輿論承認某種作品，這是事實。然這是先入爲主的，決不是出於自由的心境，也不是自發的愛好的結果。各人稱讚的作品是誰也不曾吟味的作品。」這樣，一切都沒有，剩下的只是個人底主觀的印象，是則所謂個人的主觀印象便是沒有實際依據的，玄妙莫解的了。如此玄妙莫解的印象主義，其影響所及，甚至使人們根本否認客觀真理之存在，說根本沒有正確的文學理論，甚而至於說文學概論這東西也是沒有的。但最後說來，其理論仍是存在於客觀社會中的觀念論底一種理論形態。</p>
<p>法國萬龍說」沒有一種科學被形而上學的幻想壓迫得像美學似的。自從柏拉圖直到現代公共學說，一般人常把藝術做成一種精細幻想和神秘蘊奧的物件，遂致最高的言詞竟拘束於美的，不變的，上帝範圍的，實體意想的特別範圍里。」這是正確的診斷。因爲藝術，文學是離社會基礎較遠的最上層的社會的意識形態，不易直接看出其與社會基礎底關係，所以形而上學——觀念論是最容易以各種姿態伸張其勢力於這領域中去的。</p>

<p>新西蘭即一般所稱的紐絲倫，也是英國的五大子國之一。這里華僑的地位大略也與在澳洲者相同。據調查，在五十餘年前，此間即有華僑四千二百十五人。但同樣當地政府及人民對於華僑非常注意，時時加以排斥，在一九零七年新政府更規定凡華僑入境概須受英文百字的試騐。這麽一來，在新西蘭的華僑當然不能有所發展了。</p>
<p>新西蘭的華僑以廣東人爲最多，他們多半是作小商人，園藝業者，其生活據說還不很壞。</p>
<p>西印度羣島本是黑人的世界，但政治經濟的權却全在歐美人之手。華僑因爲能刻苦耐勞，在一般工商業中亦頗有力量；雖然近來此間的黑人與白人的混血種在一般職業部門中頗爲活躍，與華僑競爭，但亦不能動搖其固有的地位。</p>

<p>Abyssinia, Today, bloody battles continue on three fronts. Italian aircraft have bombed Adowa for the third time, Adigrat for the second time, and the town of Giamò, the capital of Avash Scioa, for the first time. Additionally, aircraft bombed cities and towns in the Ogaden province near Italian Somaliland, as well as Abyssinian army camps in the suburbs. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Adowa has not yet fallen. Last night, a large crowd gathered outside the Palazzo Venezia, hoping for Mussolini to announce the Italian army's capture of Adowa. After waiting for a long time, Mussolini did not appear, and the crowd quietly dispersed in disappointment. Apart from capturing Adigrat, the Italian army has not achieved other victories. According to the latest reports from the front, the Italian army has consolidated its position in Adigrat and is now slowly advancing towards Adowa. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Italian Front Line in Eritrea, The Italian Northern Army, under the cover of bombers, is advancing forward. Today, it was confirmed that Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, led the air force and bombed the town of Adowa three times, as well as bombing the Abyssinian army moving eastward from Adigrat. The Italian army's advance speed is two and a half miles per hour. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's communique claims that the Italian army is encountering fierce resistance from the Abyssinian defenders near Adowa, but the Italian army is still advancing towards its destination. The southern offensive army has reportedly occupied the town of Genale Doria near the Italian Somaliland border. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Asmara, Italian Chief of Staff General Gaba declared that there are currently over 100,000 soldiers fighting in the Adowa area, including six regular divisions, plus various auxiliary units. It is also heard that the Italian army is having considerable difficulty marching in the mountains. This afternoon, artillery and rifle fire were heard here. The Italian army's primary objective seems to be to encircle Adowa. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia, Fierce fighting is currently taking place in front of the Italian trenches north of Adowa, with both sides engaging in close-quarters combat with short blades, but neither side has achieved a significant victory. Both sides have suffered many casualties. It is heard that there are scattered battles within Adowa. At the same time, it is heard that Italian aircraft bombed the area of Gelocubi in the Ogaden province this morning. There are no definite war reports from the southern front. Today, seven Italian aircraft flew over the area of Haiya Fici, seventy miles from Abyssinia. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia, According to Abyssinian authorities, General Seyoum is currently resisting the Italian army in Adowa, while General Ailù of Abyssinia has led a large army of 12,000 men to spy on the town of Agordat, a vital railway town in Italian Eritrea, located 120 miles northwest of Adowa and about 50 miles from the Eritrean-Abyssinian border. It is heard that its vanguard has crossed the Eritrean border and occupied several Italian guard posts. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia, The territory of Danakil in northeastern Abyssinia was the site of extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat throughout yesterday. Both sides suffered heavy losses. According to unofficial estimates, 1,300 Abyssinian soldiers and 700 Italian soldiers died in that area alone yesterday. The fighting near Asbi Alfar was particularly fierce. Italian aircraft flew over the skies of Taisi Bor in the Walio region at 8:00 AM this morning, bombing heavily. At the same time, the Abyssinian government claims that 63 people died in the town of Adowa due to the Italian aircraft attack. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a telegram from Abyssinia, General Seyoum, the governor of the Tigre region, has apparently not yet arrived on the Adowa front with his main force. It is heard that only one Abyssinian division is defending against the Italian army there. After the Italian army safely crossed the Mareb River yesterday, fierce fighting continued around Adowa all day long. The Abyssinian army fought bravely and fearlessly, but suffered heavy losses due to the superior Italian weaponry. Both sides are currently at a stalemate, with neither side giving ground. The Italian army has deployed many tanks and armored vehicles to assist in the battle, especially many that have been transferred to the Ogaden front. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to today's government communique, the Italian Eastern Army has launched a large-scale attack on Abyssinia from the Somaliland side, with Harar and Diredawa as their destinations. Diredawa is a central station on the Abyssinia-Djibouti railway. If the attack succeeds, Abyssinia's communication with overseas will be completely cut off. The communique also stated that the town of Dolo in southern Abyssinia has been occupied by the Italian army, and Gorahai is under bombardment. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia, This morning, the Abyssinian Emperor ordered all foreign nationals in the provinces to evacuate Diredawa, which is currently the target of the most recent offensive by the Italian army on the southeast fronts. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia, The Italian army advancing from the southern front has already approached the railway line. The Abyssinian government has specially granted permission for 200 French soldiers to be sent to the city of Diredawa along the railway to protect foreign nationals there. These French soldiers will soon be sent to the city. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Baldwin Urges Italy to Reconsider; Britain Cannot Ignore European Affairs; A Prelude to Using Force to Uphold Treaties <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a highly anticipated speech today at the annual meeting of the Conservative and Unionist Associations in Bournemouth. The Prime Minister's remarks were largely directed at Abyssinia, but he still urged Italy to reconsider and refrain from actions that would further complicate the work of the League of Nations' Administrative Council. The Prime Minister began by saying that the idea of isolationism and non-involvement in foreign affairs is extremely dangerous. The time when European events will impact the entire Empire may soon arrive. As a nation and as an empire, we cannot refuse to be involved in European affairs. Those who guide our policies are driven not only by the interests that strike at our very life and death, but also by the solemn international obligation to uphold treaties. There is no historical animosity between Britain and Italy. To suggest that we instigated the League of Nations' Administrative Council to oppose Italy for selfish and base purposes contradicts our national self-respect and is unacceptable to the British government. The British government has never intended to act alone. Britain will reject any suspicion arising from its loyalty to the League of Nations Covenant. It is not good for the League of Nations for one of its major powers to be suspected of such base motives. I very much hope that I will not hear this kind of slander again, Baldwin said. Baldwin also said, I believe that a collective security system can provide Britain with greater security than any other policy. What we need most is the preservation of peace in Europe. Some people believe that the collective security system and the League of Nations are the best ways to maintain peace in Europe or to exercise restraint when peace is temporarily broken. The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for the support from the Empire's representatives and all over the world received by Britain in Geneva. He said that in the League of Nations' current difficult times, we must not forget that any action must be taken with the agreement and cooperation of all. The Prime Minister also denied the claim that Britain did not inform Italy of its views at the initial stage of the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, saying that diplomatic contacts were always being made. Since the Great War, Britain has practically disarmed more than any other country in Europe, but after Germany re-armed, the overall situation is different from the past. Therefore, Britain can no longer continue on the same path as before. I am not saying that Germany or any other country is necessarily a formidable enemy, but the appearance of another major power with arms has completely changed the European landscape. The fulfillment of League of Nations obligations may one day lead to the interpretation of fulfilling obligations through the use of force by member states to uphold the League of Nations Covenant. The Prime Minister continued, Dictators are another new element. Although they may be extremely peaceful in the beginning, history shows that they will inevitably change their focus in the future, shifting from domestic politics to foreign adventures. I am not satisfied with our current position. If we cannot fully implement the League of Nations obligations, it is dangerous to accept them. I do not want to hear questions from all over the world about Britain's ability to fulfill its obligations. In any circumstances, we are confident that our ability is not inferior to that of our neighbors, nor do we feel that it is difficult to obtain food supplies from overseas. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e3">German Foreign Ministry's Extremely Active Work; Hitler's Representatives Active in Various Countries <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although official sources say that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has nothing to do with Germany, and they do not comment on German Ambassador to Italy Hassel's meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, the Foreign Ministry's work is extremely active. According to this reporter, Hassel recently came to Berlin and received instructions from the German government before meeting with Mussolini yesterday. German diplomatic authorities are currently trying to join hands with Italy and intend to take the opportunity to attack the collective security system, which can be imagined. In general, people believe that Germany's ambition is to complete various bilateral agreements to undermine the collective security plan. This can be seen from the fact that Hitler's confidant Ribbentrop has visited Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and other countries. In addition, the German State Railway Bureau recently sent a delegation to Hungary, and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and the Chairman of the Polish Sejm's Foreign Affairs Committee, Prince Radziwiłł, have recently visited Berlin. All of this has clues to be found. (5th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee: To Appeal to Italy and Abyssinia for a Ceasefire; Draft is Currently Soliciting Opinions from One or Two Non-Council Members; Abyssinia Requests Invocation of Article 16 of the Covenant <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Abyssinian government today sent a note to the League of Nations, requesting the implementation of sanctions under Section 2 of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned this morning that the report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee avoids directly referring to Italy as the aggressor. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Thirteen-Nation Committee reconvened to consider the draft report of the Five-Nation Subcommittee on the legal points of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The morning meeting lasted until 1 PM, and the discussions were mostly about the opinions put forward by the Russian and Turkish representatives regarding the 1906 treaty on Abyssinia signed by Britain, France, and Italy. The draft report submitted this morning does not seem to be practical. One representative called it a kind of painkiller. It is heard that it contains only one clause, namely, an appeal to both Italy and Abyssinia to stop the war. The proposed recommendations have apparently been sent to the governments of one or two member states that are not members of the Administrative Council to solicit their opinions. Replies will not be received until 4 PM. Therefore, the Thirteen-Nation Committee decided to adjourn until after 4 PM. The decision of the Thirteen-Nation Committee to make recommendations proves that the committee is still proceeding according to the procedures stipulated in Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Administrative Council must wait until the report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee has been approved by the public before it can proceed to consider Article 16 of the Covenant and the issue of sanctions. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday evening at 8 PM, the Thirteen-Nation Committee met to consider the report drafted by the Five-Nation Committee, and the meeting did not end until 1 AM this morning. By that time, all the members were tired and sleepy. The legal points involved in the report, namely the conclusions drawn from the facts listed in the historical report drafted by the Secretariat of the League of Nations, were also discussed yesterday. The committee scheduled to reconvene at 10:30 AM this morning to conclude its work. Yesterday morning's meeting did not involve the issue of making recommendations, but this may be done this morning, and there will be informal discussions on the new situation arising from the outbreak of war in East Africa. This afternoon, the Administrative Council will hold a plenary meeting to further consider the above two reports. The Administrative Council will first hold a closed-door consultation, followed by a public meeting. It is expected that the Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi will attend the meeting to make an important statement. The important matter of the closed-door consultation is to determine whether the procedures stipulated in Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant are no longer applicable because a state of war already exists. However, since the information received by the Administrative Council is still very contradictory, the Administrative Council may adopt a few short recommendations to submit to the public meeting. The Administrative Council seems to be proposing to convene a General Assembly of the League of Nations, which may be held on October 9. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council held a meeting at 10:45 AM this morning, at which the report to the Administrative Council was discussed. In addition to describing the course of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, this report puts forward three propositions: (1) to request the two parties involved in Italy and Abyssinia to immediately cease hostilities; (2) the three proposals put forward by the Five-Nation Committee on September 18 can be used as a basis for future negotiations; (3) to continue to use Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant as the basis. The Thirteen-Nation Committee then adjourned at 12:45 PM and scheduled to continue the meeting at 4 PM in the afternoon in order to organize the wording of the report so that it becomes a final draft. As for the Administrative Council, it will hold a non-public meeting after the Thirteen-Nation Committee adjourns, and then hold a public meeting. At that time, Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi and Abyssinian Delegate Haile Werde will express their opinions, each attributing the responsibility for the war to the other party. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council will meet today to prepare to condemn Italy's illegal invasion of Abyssinia. The Thirteen-Nation Committee has completed its opinion on this case this morning and will submit it to the Administrative Council this afternoon. However, it was heard this morning that the Administrative Council will not be able to meet until tonight. When someone inquired about the nature of the report submitted to the Administrative Council, one member declared, "The content is quite tough." It is now known that all members of the Administrative Council will participate in the meeting. Those who arrived here this morning include Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, French Foreign Minister Laval, Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi, and Abyssinian Minister to France Haile Werde. It is heard that after they arrive here, they will contact British League of Nations Minister Eden and representatives of other countries in order to determine the attitude of the Administrative Council. The Thirteen-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting at the League of Nations Secretariat last night and reviewed the report of the Five-Nation Committee. The report, which is 19 pages long, outlines the positions of both Italy and Abyssinia. It is now known that the Thirteen-Nation Committee will prepare another report based on this report and submit it to the Administrative Council. Observers today predict that the League of Nations Administrative Council will first determine that Italy is the aggressor, and then the Administrative Council and the General Assembly will vote to implement the Covenant, followed by an investigation and gradually implement economic sanctions, with military sanctions as the final measure. It is heard that the entire process will take several weeks, or even months, to complete. (4th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Italy Demands Removal of Mediterranean Defenses; Britain Remains Silent; Mussolini's Strategy of Conciliation with Britain Fails <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Hoare received a telegram from Italian Ambassador Grandi in Rome, stating that although Italy has taken action in Abyssinia, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still determined to agree on a solution with Britain and France whenever possible to prevent the war from escalating. The reply stated that the Italian government has an unfortunate and serious misunderstanding of Britain's attitude. The fact that Italy has adopted military action has made it more difficult to move towards a solution. As for the Italian Prime Minister's proposal to abolish the Mediterranean defense plan to prevent dangers that do not truly exist, the Foreign Secretary remained silent. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi presented Foreign Secretary Hoare with a note from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon, putting forward two new proposals regarding a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute: (1) The current tense situation in the Mediterranean should be replaced by cooperation of a peaceful nature, and the precautionary measures taken by all countries should be abolished; (2) Italy is extremely willing to maintain peace in Europe, and therefore Italy will not withdraw from the League of Nations, even if members of the League treat Italy unfairly; (3) Britain and Italy should hold negotiations so that the current dispute can be resolved. According to this reporter, Britain may not readily accept this proposal, because Italy has previously made similar proposals, which have been rejected by Britain. As for the precautionary measures taken by Britain and Italy, since Italy has concentrated 80,000 troops in the colony of Cyrenaica near the Egyptian border, Britain has also concentrated a naval fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and near the Suez Canal, and has concentrated the main fleet in the Strait of Gibraltar. The cruisers stationed in the China Sea and the West Indies have also sailed to the Red Sea. Therefore, as long as the Italian war against Abyssinia does not stop, and as long as the strong forces deployed in East Africa are not withdrawn, it will be difficult for Britain to remove the precautionary measures taken in the Mediterranean. As for holding negotiations, Italy has also previously suggested that Britain, France, and Italy hold negotiations in the hope of resolving the dispute. Britain rejected this on the grounds that it was inconvenient to open up another avenue outside the League of Nations. At this time, Italy is bringing up the old matter again. Britain still believes that negotiations must be initiated by Britain and France entrusted by the League of Nations and carried out in the name of the League of Nations before it can be accepted. Furthermore, even if this procedure is adopted, success requires Mussolini to make concessions, and his concessions must be more generous than those previously proposed for a compromise to be possible. However, it is not yet known to what extent Italy can make concessions. It should be explored through diplomatic channels so that a suitable response can be made. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Seriousness of Customs Duty Evasion <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>According to the national budget for the 24th year of the Republic, China's customs revenue is listed as 326,361,400 yuan, accounting for 43% of the total recurring revenue of 761,970,199 yuan. If we compare it to the debt servicing expenses of 274,803,279 yuan, it accounts for 84% of the customs revenue. It is clear that customs duties occupy a crucial position in China's finances. The surplus or deficit of tax revenue is of great importance. In recent years, all industries have been in decline, and the agricultural villages have gone bankrupt, so the volume of imports and exports is not as prosperous as before. The practice of tax evasion has become even more prevalent. Initially, merchants would only smuggle and conceal goods, hoping to reduce the burden. For example, Article 1, Section 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Revised Import Tariff of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that if a merchant refuses to present a genuine invoice and does not provide a reasonable explanation that satisfies the customs, the merchant has no right to protest against the amount of tax levied by the customs on the goods. This is intended to prevent tax concealment. Although tax concealment is detrimental to tax revenue, it is not the same as tax evasion. Since the outbreak of war in the north, smuggling in Qinhuangdao and Yushugou has suddenly increased. Recently, there has even been the organization of "Cooperative Trading Stations" specializing in smuggling. Goods smuggled out of the customs are silver, silver dollars, and Central Bank and Bank of Communications notes. Goods smuggled into the customs are linen, sugar, artificial silk, etc. The smugglers are organized and armed. When they encounter customs anti-smuggling personnel, they use force to resist. In one instance, they were caught smuggling artificial silk, resulting in a customs officer being beaten and left for dead. On its way back from an anti-smuggling mission on the waters off Yantai, a customs patrol ship was detained by Japanese military police on a pretext. Yantai and Dalian are separated by only a narrow strip of water. Qingdao has the latent power for smuggling. It has become customary. If it obstructs their actions, they will inevitably be jealous and resentful. Although the customs in Xiamen is working hard to combat smuggling, smuggling groups are organized, have backgrounds, and have bodyguards. Customs ships are met with gunfire when they pursue smugglers. From January 1 to September 19 of this year, only a little more than 4,900 bags of imported foreign sugar were imported, which is a small number. They were all sold in Zhangzhou. Xiamen does not produce sugar and has no reserves, so where do the more than 2,000 bags of sugar consumed each month come from? It is known that they are smuggled. There are 500 Japanese Taiwanese people in Shantou. They collect foreign rice, bean cakes, and artificial silk from Guangdong Province and sell them at a special tax. The various trade donation taxes on controlled white sugar, cement, and fertilizer are heavy, and prices are expensive. Taiwanese people see that there is profit to be made, so they purchase large quantities of rice, beans, and bean cakes and dump them in Shantou without paying taxes, so the prices are low. The inventories of various industries have been greatly affected.</p>
<p>The customs duties of China are mostly used as collateral for internal and external debts and indemnities. If tax revenue is insufficient, how can it fulfill its obligations? If one party undermines its tax revenue and the other party orders it to reorganize its old debts, China, although trustworthy, does not have the magic touch to turn lead into gold. Therefore, preventing smuggling is not only a problem that the Chinese authorities should focus on, but also other countries that are related to this and want to improve their foreign relations with China should also provide assistance.</p>

<p>(London) The French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, delivered the French government's reply to the Foreign Office this morning. According to our correspondent, the French reply is of a positive nature, and its content is as follows: (1) France hopes that Britain will accept mutual obligations; (2) The cooperation between the two countries should not be limited to the navy alone, but should also include the army and air force; (3) Britain and France should also cooperate to deal with acts of aggression by non-League of Nations member states; (4) Mutual consultation should take place before mutual assistance is implemented. In addition, France raised several questions as follows: (1) Should mutual assistance between Britain and France not be limited to dealing with countries that violate the League of Nations Covenant? Is Britain prepared to assist France if there are violations of the Locarno Pact? (2) Will Britain consult with France before implementing various preventive measures so that these measures are not mistaken as provocative? (3) Regarding mutual assistance plans, can Britain technically agree on a method in advance? (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government recently inquired of France what attitude it would take if the British fleet in the Mediterranean were attacked. Regarding this question, the French government has now provided a reply, which was delivered to the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, tonight for transmission to the British government. It is reported that the gist of the reply is that if an incident occurs in the future due to the execution of certain actions, and such actions have been consulted with France in advance and are endorsed by France, then France will accept all its responsibilities. Furthermore, France is willing for the French navy to assist Britain, but at the same time, Britain must also allow that if the same situation occurs on the European continent in the future, Britain should also provide the same level of assistance to France.

<h3 id="e11">Laval's Policies Receive Confidence of French Cabinet; Will Meet with Italian Representative Again <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet meeting has instructed Foreign Minister Laval not to approve the implementation of severe sanctions against Italy. An Associated Press reporter learned today from authoritative sources that France is only willing to participate in very mild economic and financial sanctions and opposes any military sanctions. A statement was issued after the cabinet meeting, stating that the cabinet has just approved Foreign Minister Laval's official statements in the League of Nations and has decided on his future position in Geneva. From this, it can be seen that the cabinet members unanimously trust Laval. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet meeting this afternoon discussed the diplomatic situation and unanimously decided on the following two points: (1) No military sanctions will be taken against the aggressor nation; (2) France is prepared to participate in economic pressure on the aggressor nation, such as refusing loans, prohibiting the transport of munitions and raw materials needed for military industries to the aggressor nation, and completely prohibiting the purchase of goods from the aggressor nation. As for a blockade, it should be regarded as a military measure, but if the blockade is implemented in a gradual manner so that various efforts can be used at the same time to seek a cessation of armed conflict, then France is also prepared to give it a try. In short, the main outline of French policy is to respect the obligations it has undertaken to the League of Nations, but it should take the recommendations unanimously passed by the League of Nations Administrative Council as its maximum limit. It is also reported that the Italian representative Aloisi is scheduled to arrive in Geneva tomorrow, at which time French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will make proposals to Aloisi. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) With the full support of the French Premier Laval, it has been firmly decided that France must carry through to the end and fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. At the same time, France will continue to strive for a resolution of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute so as not to affect European peace. It is reported that Laval is now prepared to support: (1) declaring Italy as an aggressor nation, and the procedures for sanctions under the League of Nations Covenant should be followed; (2) refusing credit and loans to Italy and prohibiting the import of raw materials into Italy; (3) banning the import of Italian goods into France. It is reported that the sanctions steps discussed by Laval and British cabinet member Eden also include lifting the ban on the supply of military supplies to Ethiopia and France and Britain jointly blockading to prevent Italian military supplies from entering East Africa, etc. However, Laval has not asked the cabinet to allow him to carry out this plan, in anticipation of which France may ultimately agree to lift the ban on the supply of military supplies to Ethiopia. However, the talk of a blockade will cause serious opposition from various political parties now demanding neutrality. The French cabinet held an important meeting this afternoon to study the general situation, which lasted for three hours and only ended at 6:10 pm, after which a communiqué was issued. It is said that the cabinet has approved the government's reply to Britain's inquiry as to what attitude France will take if the British fleet in the Mediterranean is suddenly attacked by the Italian fleet. It is reported that this reply will be delivered to London tonight, stating that if Italian ships attack the British fleet in the Mediterranean before the League of Nations implements sanctions, then France is prepared to support Britain, but Britain must also give the same guarantee that if the same incident occurs in the future and affects France, Britain should also assist France. Laval reported on the international situation and the matters to be discussed by the League of Nations in great detail at the cabinet meeting. The cabinet unanimously supported Laval's position to be taken in Geneva and expressed complete trust in Laval. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the cabinet yesterday approved the principles of Anglo-French cooperation and Foreign Minister Laval's continued freedom to deal with contingencies in Geneva, the cabinet members unanimously insisted on forceful reservations. Responsible parties stated today that the extent to which France is willing to bear is to join in prohibiting the export of munitions and raw materials for munitions and the extension of loans. France does not want to join in blockading Italy, nor does it want to sever diplomatic and commercial relations, and it is even less willing to join in any plans that could lead to war. Before starting for Geneva, Laval assured the cabinet members that he would act cautiously and would never involve France in any plans unless Britain gave a firm guarantee to assist France in the same way in the event of a Franco-German war. Before his departure, Laval issued a statement urging the people to remain calm and end party strife in order to cope with the world crisis. As can be seen from this, newspapers here indicate that if Foreign Minister Laval approves military sanctions, France is bound to have a civil war. A large number of monarchist youths marched through the streets today, shouting "Down with sanctions!" Members of the French National Social Party posted slogans everywhere saying "We don't want the League of Nations' troops." (National Society News dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senior State Department officials stated today that the United States' attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian issue will follow the lead of the League of Nations, that is, to gradually impose an arms embargo on belligerent countries, or to declare the United States' position on the state of war in Africa or Europe. It is deeply felt here that an arms embargo can only have a moral impact. According to the State Department, the only real help that the United States can provide in this crisis is in the moral realm. Most observers here believe that if the United States announces a ban, it will only include weapons and ammunition; other military supplies, such as food, copper, and cotton, will not be included in the ban. There is much speculation in Europe about what the consequences will be if the United States still supplies raw materials and food to Italy after the League of Nations implements economic sanctions against Italy. It is believed here that even if the United States supports collective European sanctions, these items cannot be prohibited from export. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Senator Nye of the Republican Party of South Dakota told an Associated Press reporter today that if the United States cooperates with Britain and France to implement economic sanctions against Italy, it will be drawn into the whirlpool. Nye is the chairman of the Senate Munitions Investigation Committee and is an extreme advocate of American neutrality in Congress. Nye continued to say that there is only one way to maintain neutrality, and that is that we should not unilaterally sanction one of the belligerent countries. If sanctions are necessary, then we should treat the belligerent countries equally, without discrimination. Ninety-nine percent of Americans are determined to avoid war, but a few weeks of propaganda can easily change their attitude. We should be wary of the fact that the events of 1914 may be repeated today. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(London) Observers here today generally believe that as the African war progresses, European peace is also hanging by a thread. In view of the concentration of naval and air forces and the laying of mines in the Mediterranean, there is also a possibility of danger before the League of Nations can pass military sanctions, because a touch-and-go situation is enough to draw Italy into the whirlpool of European war. The news that Italian ports are laying mines and that large ocean liners are not docking in Italian ports is enough to prove this danger. It is reported that other shipping companies have also ordered their ships to avoid the entire Mediterranean Sea. The increase in war risk insurance premiums is enough to prove that all of Europe deeply fears that the Italo-Ethiopian conflict may spread. Premier Mussolini declared to the Associated Press reporters that the solution to the Abyssinian problem must be decisive and thorough. At that time, observers of the European situation believed that Mussolini was not exaggerating. The news received today is even more proof of this matter. Therefore, the news from Geneva tomorrow may be even more unfavorable. The current thorny issue in Europe is how to stop the war in Abyssinia so that it does not spread to Europe. It is generally believed that economic sanctions alone are definitely not enough to slightly suppress Mussolini's ambition. Judging from today's situation, the League of Nations Administrative Council will clearly rule that Italy is an aggressor nation, so that Article 16 of the Covenant will automatically take effect. After that, the Administrative Council should decide the nature and scope of sanctions, as well as the method of implementation. It is now believed here that France will support the sanctions policy, and the first step will be to adopt economic sanctions. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Seaside News: Continuous strong winds and heavy rains have caused surging tides.

<p>(Qingjiangpu) Yellow River water has seized the canal route. One stream entered the main channel from Hanzhuang at the Weishan Lake mouth, and another stream broke through the Lanjiaba breach in the west dike of Weishan Lake, entering the Xutang canal mouth and passing through the Bulao Fangting rivers, inundating Tang Songshanxi's new dike into Huangdun Lake, breaking through the western dike of the central canal and entering the canal. The area above Mao'erwo in Pizhou is a continuous expanse of rivers and lakes, navigable directly to Dongzhuang. This is the situation of the Yellow River breach, where the western and central canal mainstreams have been seized. East of the canal, the breach at Dayushu in Pizhou County has the most turbulent flow. Because it is blocked by the southern dike of the Yi River, most of the Yellow River water still follows the Yi River and enters the canal from the Zhulou Dam. Therefore, although the eastern dike of the canal in Pizhou has collapsed, the downstream ice conditions in the central canal are still rising due to this. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<p>After arriving in Hankou on the afternoon of the 22nd with Mr. Wang Jiyuan, the reporter crossed the river to Wuchang the next morning and visited Mr. Ma Manfei and Mr. Sun Jiyi of the Provincial Government Secretariat. At 5 pm on the 24th, upon the introduction of Feng Ruozhi, the reporter paid a visit to Zhang Yuejun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and had a long conversation for over an hour. The main points of his talk are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The reporter stated that the purpose of this trip was to observe the general situation in Sichuan, so he first asked Mr. Zhang to describe the recent situation in Sichuan. Zhang said that the obstacles to progress in Sichuan are gradually being removed, and everything is gradually getting on the right track. He deeply hopes that foreign investment will flow in in the future, which will make all construction easier. He then inquired about the recent situation in Hubei Province, the policy direction, and the situation in Wuhan. Zhang replied that since arriving in Hubei, it had been six months, and he had focused on (1) educating the people, (2) organizing the people, and (3) cultivating the people's productive capacity, aiming to achieve the goal of "everyone using their talents and the land yielding its benefits." The difficulty is that Hubei Province has not recovered since the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), and this year it has suffered another huge flood. The area affected by the disaster is even greater than that of the 20th year of the Republic. Forty-nine of the province's seventy counties were affected by the flood, and another seven counties were affected by the drought, with a total of more than seven million victims. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to economize in all aspects and raise funds to help the victims. Due to financial constraints, many construction projects have not been fully implemented. At present, the provincial government's monthly expenditure is only 80,000 yuan. The salaries of the officials were already very low, and have recently been reduced by another 10%, making life even more difficult. Therefore, those who want to work in officialdom flock to the capital, followed by provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are relatively affluent. Those who come to Hubei Province to work must have a spirit of sacrifice, so there are very few. As for the commercial situation in Wuhan, it is very difficult. After the flood of the 20th year of the Republic, many small and medium-sized shops were washed away. Those that exist now are relatively strong, so from a superficial point of view, the economic downturn is very deep.</p>
<p>Regarding the cause of this year's flood in Hubei Province, some say it was due to the flooding of the Yangtze River, some say it was due to flash floods, and some say it was due to the sudden rise of the Han River. Opinions vary. According to Zhang's discussion of the causes of this flood and the strategies for flood control and disaster relief, he said that the reason why this year's disaster in Hubei Province was so serious was due to the simultaneous rise of the Yangtze River and the Han River. To control floods, it is necessary to find solutions upstream of the Yangtze River and the Han River. As the saying goes, "The Yangtze River is the benefit of Sichuan, but the disaster of Chu." Judging from the situation in the past four years, this is very credible. However, the fundamental solution to the flood disaster in Hubei Province cannot be achieved by Hubei Province alone, and requires overall planning, design, and implementation by the central government. The most important thing is to imitate the flood control methods of the Mississippi River in the United States, and artificially set up water storage areas upstream, so that the water in the downstream areas will not rise suddenly, and the rise will not be too high. At present, Wuhan's commerce is very exhausted due to the impact of the global economic downturn, and the agricultural economy has also been greatly affected. It is expected that this winter, urban commerce and rural economy will be more difficult than in previous years. Therefore, in terms of disaster relief, we can only focus on work relief, and winter relief is especially important and must be planned in advance. Hubei Province has limited financial resources, and we deeply hope that the central government will provide subsidies.</p>
<p>He also asked whether it was possible to promote industry in Hubei Province in the near future. Zhang said that China is an agricultural country, and if China wants to modernize, it is impossible without increasing industry. However, Hubei Province does not have many mineral resources, but the cotton industry has always been developed. Therefore, his personal economic policy was originally to first promote cotton planting and the cotton textile industry, so that both farmers and workers can benefit. Unfortunately, the yarn factories in Hankou are currently affected by the dumping of foreign goods, and three of the four factories have been shut down one after another. Even if we want to promote the yarn industry, it is not easy. He expressed deep emotion. Finally, he reiterated that transportation and water conservancy are the prerequisites for all material construction. If transportation is not developed, industry and commerce cannot be promoted. If water conservancy is not emphasized, floods will occur frequently, and the construction of the rural economy will not be solid. Therefore, if China wants to develop, it needs specialized talent in transportation and water conservancy in the future.</p>

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The declaration of the East Asia Economic Association states: "Land is what nourishes people. The secret of natural selection and survival of the fittest has been established, and it is increasingly evident that no one does not seek survival. In recent times, the theory of opening doors has filled the world, and cunning acquisition and forceful seizure, based on the weak being preyed upon by the strong, are not permitted by the public, but closing doors and rejecting others, even if it is enough to protect precious jade, is also not allowed by the situation. Being able to understand this meaning is enough to talk about the current world economic competition. However, the definition of a country has its own indestructible definition in social science. Those who advocate internationalism without borders are trying to destroy other people's countries in the name of doctrines, deceiving others for their own benefit, and causing every country on earth to be in danger. Examining the origin of this theory, it is nothing more than taking the remnants of "the capitalist system will inevitably collapse, and the socialist system will inevitably rise instead," and advocating and promoting it in the hope of smashing the existing economic organizations of various countries in the world and proving that their doctrine can be promoted quickly. It is strange that the capitalist countries of today are digging their own graves, such as tariff wars, production recovery, and currency inflation. All these measures are aimed at harming others and benefiting oneself, even to the point of squeezing the blood and sweat of allied countries to pay for the cost of military expansion. If glory is not restored, collapse will occur immediately. Isn't this just causing the enemy to be emboldened and the loved ones to be chilled? Originally, production relations occur between humans, and they are becoming increasingly profound internationally. Therefore, these relations between countries are not only unavoidable but also need to be well combined. The productivity and production relations of Country A and Country B should correspond to each other and cooperate together, and their economic organization will be healthy. It is hoped that international economic relations will be extremely intricate and complex, so it is appropriate to adopt the group economic policies that are popular today, expand them, and choose those with contiguous lands, the same race, and similar lifestyles and cultures, and unite them on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Seek only growth, do not engage in squeezing. In this way, in terms of national survival and development, there will be no internal pressure, and it will be possible to respond to trends from the outside. The self-existence and self-determination of the East Asian nations are also justified, but the fact that they are fighting each other has led to them being at the mercy of others. It is like a family fighting for property. At first, they are fighting for food, then they are stripped of their clothes, and neighbors are invading. The family is destroyed and will not stop until they are all dead. Then, looking back at the internal strife, is it really something that cannot be stopped? The reason why we believe that East Asian economic relations must cooperate is one reason. World peace is threatened again, and none of them do not stem from the struggle of economic groups. The horizontal and vertical exclusions between European countries, the conflicts of emerging forces on the Danube, the old reefs that exist in the Balkan Peninsula, and the current tension between Italy and Asia, are said to be political deductions that are stimulated to form. It is better to say that they are economic aggressions that are forced into this. The final scene of America's recovery policy and the Soviet Union's second five-year plan is not difficult to reveal. Then, East Asia is an excellent market, and how can competition be an exception? However, whether the economic situation in East Asia is stable depends on World War II and is not superficial. However, as far as China is concerned, its vast land and abundant resources are in urgent need of development, and its cheap labor is far beyond the reach of other countries. If all industries are fully developed, productivity will inevitably increase, and purchasing power will also increase accordingly. If it is used to inject into the world market, it will definitely have more than enough. Japan has already achieved outstanding achievements in economics and culture, and has achieved the status of an advanced country in East Asia. The people are diligent and hardworking, and they share the characteristics of the Eastern race with the Chinese people. From an economic point of view, what Japan lacks in production is often surplus in China, and what China needs in materials is enough for Japan to supply. In this way, the so-called operation of the economic group is not only the happiness of the East Asian countries and nations, but also the happiness of world peace. Moreover, the current Red Disaster in Northwest China is raging. If this international route, which the Communist Party has long been planning, is opened up, what will East Asia look like at that time? Thinking about it, we should not be chilled. The reason why we believe that East Asian economic cooperation must start from China and Japan is another reason. Conflicts between China and Japan in past political measures have also been caused by poor economic relations. Take a look at the political loans for participating in the war and the production loans for railways, mines, forests, and telecommunications. As for joint ventures in banking, factories, and mines, the total amount is more than 700 million yuan. The former debts could not be repaid, and the latter operations were not profitable. The lending and receiving parties accumulated many evil causes, resulting in the previous evil. Since the proposal of economic cooperation has been initiated by Japan, it is better for China to accept it reluctantly than to take the initiative to expand its cooperation. Acceptance has the nature of coercion, but if we cooperate automatically, we can prepare for consultations in advance and respond well, and the parties can also participate in the plan and express their opinions. Moreover, economic groups inherently have the purpose of common interests. The so-called "rule" and the so-called "scope" are part of the method and depend on harmonious exploration. The only thing that is required is that all East Asian countries, for the sake of leading the alliance, must be absolutely equal, regardless of whether they are China or Japan, to maintain the status of sovereign independence. Second, regardless of whether it is an agricultural country or an industrial country, each should be given the opportunity to develop its abilities without restrictions, in order to conform to the principle of mutual benefit. Third, countries outside of East Asia, although not within the group, should not infringe on their acquired benefits, in order to dispel the misunderstanding of the Asian Monroe Doctrine. Fourth, the cooperative procedure should start with the development of the North China region, which is called the habit, because the area south of the Yangtze River in China has long formed its special economic scope, and the red trend in the northwest border is dangerous. Then gradually spread to various places, in order to achieve realistic possibilities. According to these four points, follow the trend, and by the rule and management, the economic coordination between China and Japan, and then the political solution, will not be difficult. The reason why we believe that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must first start with the development of North China is another reason. Narrowing down from East Asian economic relations to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and further narrowing down from the Sino-Japanese economic group to North China development, seems to imply that the meaning is not broad, and the undertaking is not difficult. In fact, there are thousands of threads, and if the end is not found, there is no way to manage it. Let's talk about the factual aspect. In recent times, the North China region, according to the general habit of interpretation, includes Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shandong as the boundary. However, the mountains, rivers, railways, and shipping routes of these provinces, whether natural or artificial, cannot be forcibly divided from other provinces, so the production benefits are also closely related. For example, Shanxi coal is sold to Shanghai, and Henan needs brine salt. Within the five provinces, transportation, construction, water conservancy, and agricultural products, such as the Cangshi and Baoning railways, are in urgent need of expansion, and the railways and highways of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan are in urgent need of connection. The cotton industry in Hebei and Shandong, and the animal husbandry in Chahar and Suiyuan, are in urgent need of improvement. If there is an operation at this time, the design is still pending. The economic situation in North China has been forced by years of floods, droughts, and wars. The rural areas are declining, and industry and commerce are depressed, resulting in reduced production and weakened purchasing power. According to customs reports, the total import and export of the region has declined, and food and population account for a large proportion. It can be said that the whole region is suffering. How can there be surplus power for development? As for technical talent, China has always lacked it. There is a precedent for cooperation with European and American experts. If we focus on the actual issues of industry, agriculture, etc., which are needed in China and Japan, and in North China at the present time, the improvement and facilities are greatly dependent on the guidance and guidance of Japanese specialists. Therefore, from the perspective of both capital and technology, the connection and introduction are indispensable. Secondly, from the theoretical aspect, the political disputes between China and Japan have not been resolved, and the seriousness of the North China issue can be found everywhere. In the past, Sino-Japanese joint ventures have often been stranded halfway or fundamentally dissipated due to the influence of prestige or situation. Now that there is reasonable and well-intentioned economic cooperation, all previous misunderstandings should be swept away. The key lies in the fact that there is a need for factual evidence, and it cannot be done without a long time. Construction projects such as opening mines, building roads, and improving land are all in close contact with the people, and common misunderstandings are unavoidable. It is planned to broadly gather local aspirations and appoint officials to alleviate them. The benefits of joint ventures must be promoted in advance through news and illustrations to avoid dissenting opinions. Therefore, these works are extremely important in cooperation. Colleagues, in view of the above-mentioned facts and theories, have one thing that hinders the development of North China, and the entire East Asian economic relationship cannot be completed. Therefore, we have initiated the East Asia Economic Association, and we are very willing to shoulder this mission and be the pioneers for our countrymen. Moreover, the fact that there has been political deterioration between China and Japan in the past is in no way the responsibility of the people of both sides. Therefore, the national economy of both sides has the freedom to cooperate. Now, one government has explicitly issued a statement of warning to its neighbors, and one government is advocating economic cooperation. Colleagues are humbly taking part in this, and we are ashamed of our meager efforts. However, we are mindful of the dangers and chaos, and it is the responsibility of everyone. Especially in the corner of North China, whether it is related to our hometown or we have been traveling for a long time, we are driven by justice and should fulfill our natural duties. Mencius once told King Xuan of Qi, "Those who delight in Heaven will preserve the world, and those who fear Heaven will preserve their country." He also quoted the words of King Tai of Zhou to tell Duke Wen of Teng, "I have heard that a gentleman does not harm people with what he uses to nourish them." We hope that the people of East Asia will all be in awe of Heaven's Mandate and strive to be gentlemen who nourish people. We will not refrain from speaking out and dare to exhaust our sincerity. We hereby declare!"</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Yanhai River Bursts: The Situation in Banpu is Critical; Important Documents of the Salt Affairs Audit Office Moved into the City; Ships Sealed and Laborers Conscripted to Build Embankments in Case of Emergency <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Guanyun Correspondence: When the Yellow River enters Jiangsu, Xu Prefecture is the first to bear the brunt. Since the Liutang River breached, Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang counties will once again be flooded. At present, in the Guanyun area, because the Chaimi River cannot be protected, they have to retreat to the Jian River. However, the water level is increasing day by day, and the situation is becoming more and more urgent. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, the water level increased exceptionally due to the tide. On the morning of the 3rd, the water level increased even more than on the 1st and 2nd. Because the sea tide was pushing upwards, the river water could not be discharged. After the Liutang Dike broke, the Chaimi River was also difficult to defend. Currently, the Yanhe River embankment is being raised, outside the Dananmen gate in Banpu, all the way to Xin'an Town, and then south to the embankment outside the Ximen gate in Lianshui. All of them are conscripting laborers to build them. People are panicking, as if a great disaster is about to happen. Early on the 4th, the north end of Dayishan Street was flooded, and the water outside the Banpu embankment was also not small. They are currently repairing the embankment and building new embankments, doing their best. The water level on the highway from Banpu to Dayi Xinpu is only one foot high. Many civilian ships have been sealed outside the Dananmen gate in case of emergency. In short, the work of blocking the breach in Shandong cannot be done urgently, and the Qingjiang Canal is not allowing diversion, so it is difficult to be optimistic about Haizhou. Ordinary autumn beans cannot be harvested until after the middle of the ninth lunar month. Wheat should have been sown early, but the farmers are watching the water level and cannot sow quickly. If the sowing of wheat is delayed again, even if the flood does not expand, there will be famine next spring. Currently, grain prices are rising, and firewood is not easy to buy, with supply exceeding demand. The Salt Affairs Audit Office outside the Xiaonanmen gate in Banpu is based there, and the distance from the water surface is limited. It is heard that on the evening of the 3rd, important documents were moved into the embankment. (October 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Bandit Suppression in Various Provinces: Road Network About to be Completed; Over Ten Provinces Including Hubei and Sichuan Have Largely Established Connections; The Executive Headquarters Has Overseen the Completion of Over 20,000 Li of Roads. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Road construction is an important task within the bandit suppression area, its effectiveness comparable to that of blockhouses. Its relationship to culture, politics, economics, and transportation is also profound. After the establishment of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, great attention was paid to the development of highways. In November of the 21st year (of the Republic), the headquarters convened a highway conference of seven provinces—Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu—to plan the trunk and branch lines of highways in the seven provinces. The scope of construction projects was also expanded to include parts of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces. The method of supervision involved submitting each province’s highway engineering plans and budgets to the Executive Headquarters for approval. For highways of significant importance to military transport in the bandit suppression effort, the Executive Headquarters would, if necessary, dispatch personnel to supervise the construction and subsidize the expenses, in addition to requiring the provincial governments to complete the construction within a specified time. Regarding the administrative system for supervision, general highways were handled by the Fifth Division, with the cooperation of the Transportation Division and the First Division. Highways of significant importance to military operations in the bandit suppression effort were handled by the First Division, with the cooperation of the Transportation Division and the Fifth Division. Highways built by military engineers were planned by the Military Engineering Construction Committee and personnel were dispatched to construct them. In addition, the Executive Headquarters also established a Highway Division to specifically oversee the construction of designated highways. The most recent establishment was the Sichuan-Guizhou Provinces Highway Supervision Office, which specializes in supervising the construction and traffic management of highways in those two provinces. Because each entity is responsible for its own duties, things are carried out in an orderly manner. Currently, the total length of completed and under-construction highways in nine provinces—Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou and Fujian—up to the end of the 23rd year (of the Republic) is as follows: (1) Henan: 2,271 kilometers completed, 458 kilometers under construction; (2) Hubei: 192 kilometers completed, 497 kilometers under construction; (3) Anhui: 4,400 kilometers completed, 303 kilometers under construction; (4) Jiangxi: 4,900 kilometers completed, 1,384 kilometers under construction; (5) Fujian: 2,532 kilometers completed, 836 kilometers under construction; (6) Shaanxi: 1,676 kilometers completed, 522 kilometers under construction; (7) Gansu: 1,353 kilometers completed, 158 kilometers under construction; (8) Sichuan: 304 kilometers completed, construction details not yet reported; (9) Guizhou: 1,574 kilometers completed, construction details not yet reported. The total is 20,202 kilometers completed and 3,158 kilometers under construction, with Jiangxi ranking first, followed by Anhui and Henan, and Gansu having the least. Recently completed and under-construction trunk lines of significant importance to military operations in the bandit suppression effort are even more numerous, most of them being inter-provincial highways with relatively long routes, including those connecting Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, Xikang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, etc. Their names are as follows: (1) Hunan-Guizhou Road: From Changsha to Guiyang, the western Hunan section has been completed and opened to traffic, but the section from Yuanling to Nianyu Pu has not yet been paved. The eastern Guizhou section is being rushed, and is now barely open to traffic. (2) Sichuan-Guizhou Road: From Chengdu to Guiyang, the entire road has been completed and opened to traffic. (3) Sichuan-Hubei Road: From Hankou to Chengdu, the Hankou-Yichang section within Hubei has long been completed and opened to traffic, and the pavement is now being laid. The Yangtze River flood this year has greatly affected the engineering project on this road. The earth road of the Badong section was completed and opened to traffic at the end of September. The Shilipu section has been surveyed and is about to be constructed. The section from Yichang to Badong is more difficult to build because it must pass through the Yangtze River. Currently, the Yangtze River is used for intermodal transport. Within Sichuan Province, the route is 925 kilometers long, of which 520 kilometers have been completed, and the remaining 405 kilometers can be completed soon. (4) Sichuan-Shaanxi Road: From Chengdu to Xi'an, within Sichuan Province, traffic has been opened to Langzhong. The section from Langzhong to the Sichuan provincial border is being supervised by the Highway Supervision Office. Within Shaanxi Province, traffic has been opened to Baoji. The section from Baoji to Hanzhong is under construction. The section from Hanzhong to the Shaanxi provincial border is still in the planning stage. (5) Sichuan-Xikang Road: From Chengdu to Kangding, the Chengdu-Ya'an section and the Kangding-Luding section have been completed and opened to traffic. The Luding-Ya'an section is being rushed. (6) Sichuan-Gansu Road: From Chengdu to Lanzhou, within Sichuan Province, traffic has been opened from Chengdu to Jiangyou. The section from Jiangyou to the Sichuan provincial border is being rushed. Within Gansu Province, traffic has been opened from Lanzhou to Dingxi. The section from Dingxi to Tianshui is under construction. The section from Tianshui to the Gansu provincial border is being surveyed. (7) Hunan-Shaanxi Road: From Hankou to Xi'an, within Hubei Province, traffic has been opened from Hankou to Baihe, but the roadbed of the section from Laohekou to Baihe has been washed away by heavy floods and cannot be used for traffic. Within Shaanxi Province, the section from Hanzhong to Ankang is under construction, and the Ankang to Baihe section has been surveyed and will be built soon. (8) Luoyang-Tongguan Road: From Luoyang to Tongguan, the entire road is under construction. (9) Xi'an-Jingziguan Road: From Xi'an to Jingziguan, the entire road is under construction. (10) Xi'an-Lanzhou Road: From Xi'an to Lanzhou, the entire road has been completed and opened to traffic. (12) Southern Hubei Road: From Wuchang to the southern Hubei border, the entire road was opened to traffic at the end of September. Looking at the highway construction situation in the above provinces, it can be seen that the highway network within the bandit suppression area is about to be completed. (4th)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: People in Caocaojiao, Chenghai County, are mostly engaged in the fishing industry. After the autumn winds rise, fishing boats form fleets and operate on the sea. On September 24th, several Heshengfa-branded fishing boats sailed near the Shantou harbor to fish. Several boats towed nets, riding the wind and waves. Before long, the nets gradually became heavy, and then the boats were restrained and could not move. The fishermen were overjoyed, thinking they had caught a large school of golden threadfin bream. Since the net was heavy and could not be lifted, they hurriedly dove to the bottom of the sea to see what it was. They discovered that what the net had caught was a huge aircraft that could carry more than a dozen people, with all kinds of equipment inside. The fishermen initially suspected that it was a submarine aircraft. After the tide receded, several fishermen and workers used large ropes and exerted great effort to hoist the aircraft up. The net was already tattered. First, the wings were removed, but the fuselage was so large that several boats could not load it, so they had to let it sink back into the sea. Several pieces of the wings and steering gear were removed and transported back. However, the fishermen's large net was already broken.</p>

<p>At about 10 p.m. on the 4th, Zeng Zihong, a teacher at Chunyi Middle School, and his wife, Ms. Wu, returned home after watching a movie at the Suzhou Grand Theater in the North Bureau. When they passed the entrance of the Bamboo Lane of the Horse Doctor Section, they suddenly encountered a thug who grabbed Ms. Wu, showed a sharp blade to threaten her. Ms. Wu was shocked and screamed, and fled into a nearby clothing store. Her husband, Zeng Zihong, rushed up to resist the thug, who stabbed Zeng's left arm and fled. Zeng shouted loudly for the police, who chased him to Erduo Bin Lane and arrested the thug. He was handed over to the Shan Police District. He confessed his name as Lu Guangting, a local resident living at No. 40, Liujia浜. He was then transferred to the Public Security Bureau on the 5th and then to the local court for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Wuxi: Confiscated Cocoon Boats Case Resolved <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Our county's Dacheng Silk Factory set up a station near Xushe in Yixing this year to purchase autumn cocoons and dried them into 1,066 bales. These were loaded onto four boats and were about to be transported when they were detained by the residents of the 6th District of the county. The Silk Factory Association of our county telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the Yixing county government be ordered to dispatch police to escort the confiscated cocoons out of the county. However, they were blocked by hundreds of residents of the district. The former magistrate of Guanxing County, Xiao, then sent Zheng Xin, the captain of the 3rd Security Brigade, to lead more than ten officers to Xushe to protect the cocoon boats. He also worked with Zhou Yuanxun, the model district chief of our county's cocoon community, to mediate with all their strength. The matter has now been completely resolved. The confiscated cocoon boats had already set sail for Wuxi yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Joint Petition of Department Store and Silk Fabric Businesses <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The local department store and silk fabric trade associations pointed out that the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association came to Wuxi this time for temporary auctions and had not heard of paying the taxes due. However, according to the Provisional Constitution, people have the obligation to pay taxes, and equality is required by law. Why should the same merchant have to bear local taxes when doing business here, while out-of-town merchants temporarily avoid them? They were unwilling to accept this, so they elected representatives yesterday to petition the county government, requesting that all local taxes and levies due by various industries be waived or temporarily allowed to be recorded as debt during the association's auction period, in order to reduce costs and show small businesses equal treatment. Shao Jingren, the chief of the First Section, came out to receive them and replied to the representatives that the National Exhibition Hall would also be charged rent for the period of one month. The collection of business taxes would be handled by the business tax collection office. The representatives were not satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Salt farmers from the Daishan salt fields in Dinghai were not compensated for the salt quota set for the five districts under their jurisdiction, causing panic among the livelihoods of more than 10,000 salt farmers. They specially sent representatives Zhou Fengxian, Zhang Tongli and others to Shanghai to negotiate with the salt management, but there were no satisfactory results. The representatives then went from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Yesterday (5th), they went to the Liangzhe Salt Transport Office to petition. The transport envoy, Zhou Zonghua, received them and promised to order the salt merchants to collect the salt at a 60% discount, as per the example of eastern Zhejiang, and ordered the salt merchants to comply immediately. The representatives of the salt farmers reluctantly accepted and immediately returned to Daishan in Dinghai to report. (Important).</p>

<p>Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, departed Beijing at 11 o'clock last night on a special train attached to the Beijing-Shanghai night express train and is heading to Shanghai. He arrived at 7:15 this morning. Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, came with him.</p>
<p>President Sun Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday. He said that the Italy-Abyssinia War Would Not Expand and that he Approves of Mr. Yan’s Land Village System</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing by night train at 11 p.m. the night before and arrived at Zhenru at 7:10 a.m. yesterday. He went straight to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. At noon, he met with reporters and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>The Italy-Abyssinia War Will Not Expand</p>
<p>Italy and Abyssinia have already started a war, and the eyes of the world are focused on the war. People are worried that the future development of the war will restart a world war. However, according to my observation, the Italy-Abyssinia war will not expand, because both Britain and France are unwilling to use force to sanction the situation in Europe, so they will not be dragged into the war. A second world war will not break out because of this. In the future, at most, the countries will only make moral sanctions and appeals for justice. As for the war between Italy and Abyssinia, if Abyssinia is defeated and suffers a miserable defeat, a peaceful solution can be expected soon. Otherwise, the war will be prolonged. But in any case, Italy will not be able to achieve its ultimate goal of eliminating Abyssinia and making it a complete colony, because Britain and France are watching from the sidelines. The war between Italy and Abyssinia has little impact on the Far East, but it would be an exception if it caused a world war.</p>
<p>The Land Village System Can be Tried</p>
<p>Yan Xishan, Director of Pacification of Shanxi Province, advocates the land village system and is willing to use Shanxi Province as a pilot area. This proposal has been submitted to Zhao Pilian to send to the National Government as soon as possible. After the Central Political Conference makes a decision, it will be implemented on a trial basis. The Kuomintang originally regarded land nationalization as the highest and ultimate goal for people's livelihood issues. Before land nationalization is implemented, the emergence of large landlords will be restricted, and the system of farmers owning the land they cultivate will be implemented first. Now, Mr. Yan resolutely advocates the land village system and has the courage to use Shanxi Province as a pilot area, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Southwest Central Committee Members Attend the Plenary Session</p>

Mr. Hu may stay in the United States for a long time and then return to China. The Legislative Yuan will hold a meeting next week, which happens to be National Day, so it has been decided to convene it one day earlier.</p>

<p>Nine major groups, including the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Bankers' Association, the Money Dealers' Association, the China General Chamber of Industry, the International Trade Association, the Pacific International Society, the Chinese Students' Global Association, and the International Problems Research Association, held a grand public banquet at the Bankers' Club on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road at 8 o'clock last night to welcome Sir Otto Niemeyer, a British economic expert. Chinese cuisine was served, divided into four tables. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 10 o'clock before the banquet ended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests and Hosts at the Banquet</p>
<p>The guests and hosts included Sir Otto Niemeyer and his entourage, Ba Zhi and Rogers, as well as the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Bailinan, and representatives from various groups: Yu Zuoting, Chen Zhetan, Ge Jiechen, Du Yuesheng, Hu Yunqiu, Feng Binglu, Chen Guangfu, Yuan Songsun, Zhu Ziliang, Qin Runqing, Xi Jiming, Pei Yunqing, Wang Qiyu, Cai Shengbai, Qian Chengxu, Zhang Yuqiu, Lin Kanghou, Zou Bingwen, Luo Chuanhua, Liu Yuwan, Zhu Youyu, Zhu Shaoping, Li Denghui, Zhou Fanping, Xu Xinliu, Chen Liting, Cao Yunxiang, Liu Hongsheng, Liu Hongen, Li Zhaohuan, Zhang Gongquan, He Dekui, Dong Xian Guang, Tu Chuyu, Rong Qin Kun, and others, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo’s Speech</p>
<p>After the chairman, Chen Zheqing, took his seat, Mr. Guo Bingwen delivered a welcome speech in English on behalf of the associations, the gist of which was as follows: "Our associations are holding this public banquet here tonight for Sir Otto Niemeyer. We are deeply honored by Sir's presence. Sir is a famous British financial expert who was dispatched to China this time to investigate the economic situation. Some of the rumors in the past about Sir's mission to China have been denied by Sir himself, and some have not been expressed by Sir. However, we firmly believe that with Sir's perseverance, this trip will definitely have good results, making the relationship between China and Britain closer. We believe that Sir will be able to report the real situation in China to the British government and hope to make correct suggestions to the British government. We would like to offer a toast to Sir's good health and happiness."</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Reply: Sir Otto Niemeyer's reply can be roughly divided into three points: 1. Because I have been in China for a short time, I am not yet clear about the Chinese situation, so I cannot make any contributions for the time being. However, I feel that what China needs most at the moment is peace, stability, and commerce. If the government can show more ability in governance, its recovery of strength can be expected. 2. It is rumored that I came here with a large amount of funds, which is an inaccurate guess, because the situations of the Chinese and British governments are very different. In China, the government often invests in the development of industries, while in Britain, it is mostly done by private individuals. 3. It is also rumored that I came here with an economic invasion, which is also a misunderstanding. China's prosperity is not only beneficial to Britain but also has a great relationship with the prosperity of the world. The relationship between China and Britain is on an equal footing.</p>

<p>Delegation Leader's Statement</p>
<p>When the economic delegation to Japan departed, delegation leader Wu Dingchang issued a written statement to the Xinsheng News Agency, which said: "The plan to organize a Chinese economic delegation to Japan has been discussed for many years and is not a recent development. After the European War, Japan's industry and commerce have made great strides, and its trade relationship with China is particularly close. It is necessary and valuable to conduct regular inspections to seek economic cooperation between the two countries. However, due to environmental factors over the years, a suitable opportunity to realize this plan has not been found. Fortunately, a joint delegation of various places and industries has been formed in a short period of time. Our long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, which is extremely gratifying. This visit is based on long-standing beliefs and sincerity. I believe that this trip will not be in vain."</p>

<h3 id="e101">Hong Kong National Bank's Shanghai Branch; Creditors Urge Liquidation; Submit Request to Ministry of Finance <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that since the Hong Kong National Bank suspended operations some time ago, no concrete solution has been announced. The creditors of the Shanghai branch, concerned about their deposits, have formed a creditors' group to pursue recovery. Recently, in addition to the group and its legal counsel, Lawyer Liang Yaobing, sending letters to Lu Zhongqing and Huang Jiyan, former managers of the Shanghai branch, they also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, urging them to take charge. The text of their petition is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Finance for Liquidation</p>
<p>The creditors' group submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "The Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong National Bank has been closed for quite some time. Although reports indicate that the bank convened a meeting of its head office creditors and shareholders in Hong Kong on the 28th of last month, the results remain shrouded in secrecy. The creditors' deposits amount to a considerable sum, and they cannot afford to abandon them indefinitely. Furthermore, the end of the year is approaching, and financial difficulties are becoming acute. We respectfully implore your Ministry, which is in charge of national finance, to oversee all banking matters. Now that the creditors have nowhere else to turn, they are compelled to request your esteemed leadership to uphold justice, so that the savings of orphans, widows, and those relying on them for sustenance and funeral expenses may not be squandered in vain. We humbly submit the following liquidation measures: (1) Please promptly order the bank to submit its assets to the Ministry for liquidation. (2) Please appoint impartial personnel from among the responsible individuals of the Bankers' Association to oversee the liquidation process. (3) If the bank is unwilling to surrender its assets, please order all debtors of the bank not to return their debts to the National Bank but to the Bankers' Association, so that the personnel appointed by the Bankers' Association may proceed with liquidation. Respectfully submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>Creditors' Remarks</p>
<p>Furthermore, a responsible person from the association told reporters that the collapse of the Hong Kong National Bank was undoubtedly an unfortunate event. Recent news of its potential reopening has been welcomed by all creditors. However, this news of reopening has only appeared in the newspapers, and the bank's representatives have not provided any clear confirmation. This is no different from an unsigned check. Therefore, the creditors dare not trust it. Moreover, once a bank has collapsed, even if it reopens, its credibility will plummet. Rumors of converting deposits into shares are unacceptable to the creditors. The group will fight to the death to protect their interests. It has also been found that some Chinese merchants, using foreign names, are unwilling to hand over their assets to Chinese government agencies for public liquidation after the collapse. This not only harms the interests of creditors but also sets a dangerous precedent. Therefore, we hope that the Ministry of Finance will use extraordinary measures, decisively and swiftly, to break this bad habit. We also hope that compatriots across the country will rise up to support us.</p>

The liquidation office is located at 149 Sichuan Road. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bank History</p>
<p>Trustcor Bank of America was founded by Mr. S. Kriger, the former manager of the Harbin Yong Sheng Company. It was established in 1927 in accordance with the laws of Nevada, USA, with its head office in Harbin. In 1928, a branch was established in Hulun. In 1929, a branch was established in Shanghai. In 1934, to facilitate business development, the head office was relocated to 100 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, Harbin branch became Shanghai branch, and a branch was set up at 774 Xiahfei Road, intersection of Jin Shenfu Road. It has correspondent banks in various countries around the world, with a paid-up capital of US$100,000. Its main business includes general deposits, remittances, and trust services. Its reserve fund amounts to US$27,750.</p>
<p>Resolution to Suspend Operations</p>
<p>Chairman and Manager Kriger and Manager Makoroff, E. K. Makoroff, due to the impact of the Northeast Incident, found it impossible to maintain operations. A board meeting at 11:00 PM on October 4 decided to cease operations. Starting yesterday morning, the head office on Jiujiang Road, the branch on Xiahfei Road, and the branches in Harbin and Hulun were all ordered by the board of directors to suspend operations. At the same time, an English notice of suspension of liquidation was posted, which translates as "The bank, pursuant to a resolution passed by the Board of Directors at 11:00 PM on October 4, 1935, has suspended operations pending the selection of a liquidator."</p>

<p>Accountant Huang Peiqi, representing Trustcor Bank, announced yesterday, "According to a statement from representatives of Trustcor Bank, the bank has been operating smoothly since its establishment. However, the Harbin branch has been unable to sustain operations due to the impact of the incident and suspended operations. The bank is unable to support itself independently and has decided to liquidate. We should announce on its behalf that all creditors are requested to present their claims for registration within fourteen days for verification. Debtors are also expected to return their debts within the same period. Otherwise, we will take legal action. This is hereby announced, and the liquidation office is located at 149 Sichuan Road, 4th Floor."</p>
<p>Reasons for Suspension</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Lawyer Chen Daxun, the legal counsel to the bank, yesterday. According to him, Trustcor Bank was established in the sixth year of the Republic of China and was originally registered in the United States, with branches on Xiahfei Road and in Harbin. The business has been stable, with a capital of US$100,000. Most of the customers are overseas Chinese and Russians. However, the global economic downturn has had an impact. Since the September 18th Incident, the Harbin branch has been greatly affected, and the bank's situation has become difficult. Deposit withdrawals have reached 70 percent. However, the bank has been able to cope. However, after the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, over 25,000 Russian employees returned to their country, further impacting the bank's operations. Therefore, it was decided to liquidate. It is also said that, according to a report from the parties involved, the bank has deposits of 280,000, but assets of over 300,000. After offsetting all income and expenses, a liquidator has been appointed and a solution should be found soon, so that depositors will not suffer losses.</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, Trustcor Bank, located in Shanghai, is run by Russians with head office in Shanghai and branches in Harbin and Hailar. It has suspended operations today (5th). Under supervision of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, it is now under liquidation. A notice written in English was posted on the door of the Bank located at No.100 Jiujiang Road which says “the Bank ceases operations in accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on the 4th of October, 1935, to await the appointment of a liquidator”. In front of the Xiahfei Road branch, No. 714, there were many people gathering in the morning, most of them Russians. The Head Office, however, was rather quiet. Most of the depositors were Russians, therefore the suspension of the bank did not affect the financial market of Shanghai. According to Law Office of Luo, the bank’s staff members guaranteed that the assets of Shanghai Bank exceed the deposits amount by a large margin. Liquidation will be done soon and the deposits are expected to be fully returned in a short period of time. The Bank suspended operation mainly because, after the Chinese Eastern Railway was sold to Japan, around 25,000 Russian people left Harbin. This caused the Harbin branch to be in a difficult situation. Due to the economic depression in Shanghai, 70 percent of the Shanghai Branch's deposits were withdrawn in the past four months. This was a fatal strike. The Bank was run by Russians. Almost all of its staff members were Russians. However, it obtained the license of Nevada. That is why “America” was added to the name of the Bank. However, it was not registered at the American Consulate General in Shanghai or Harbin. The liquidation was not submitted for approval to the American Court in China. It would be rejected if it were submitted now, since this bank is not an American merchant’s firm and is not related to American interest. The American authorities in Shanghai will not act on the liquidation. The Bank was established in Harbin in 1927 by former staff members of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank. As it observed the decline of businesses in Manchuria under Japanese rule, it moved its head office to Shanghai in 1932. According to its Business Notice of November 30th, 1934, its assets and liabilities were 6,867,545 yuan. The ready cash that was available was 44,500 yuan. The capital was 286,740 yuan. The profit and loss of the year was 274,682 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton Mills in Difficulties; Requesting Reassessment of Property Rental</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Council: We have received a letter from the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, stating that Shenxin Textile Mill No. 9, located at 140 Macau Road, pays a quarterly police rate of $5,950. Due to business difficulties, only half of the second floor is in use. They were unable to pay the summer rate and repeatedly requested the Municipal Council to consider reducing it, but their request was not granted, and they are being urgently pressed for payment. At a time when the cotton industry is extremely depressed, it is impossible to bear this burden. We respectfully request your Association to convey the difficult situation of the cotton industry to the Municipal Council and to reduce the police rate for all mills to alleviate their burden." The Association verifies that this difficult situation is known to everyone. If the cotton mills' properties are self-owned, the rental value should be reassessed to reduce their burden and facilitate their recovery. We therefore request that you order the Rate Collection Office to handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Ke Ganchen Urges Expediting the Implementation of Bank Acceptance Drafts; Using Factory Goods as Collateral; To Be Handled by a Committee Formed by the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Committee for Industrial and Commercial Recovery, after resolving to request methods for three issues of increasing chips, has now been promoting them in various quarters. Ke Ganchen, a leader in the cotton cloth industry and currently a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to Wang Yansong, Director of the Recovery Committee, advocating for the urgent promotion of bank acceptance drafts to rescue the stagnation of industry and commerce, and proposing implementation methods. The original letter is recorded below: "In recent years, our country has been shaken externally by the global economic recession, and internally by frequent natural disasters and banditry. Rural areas are bankrupt, and industry and commerce are withering. Domestic funds are concentrated in cities, causing anemia and congestion, which has long become a pathological condition. Since the United States implemented the nationalization of silver last autumn, the price of silver overseas has gradually risen, and a huge amount of our country's silver reserves has flowed out. Those with knowledge are increasingly alarmed by the reduction of silver reserves and the lack of chips to cope. Public opinion is divided, and everyone is thinking of ways to remedy the situation. To this day, there is still no concrete solution. The market is in panic, fearing the imminent arrival of a paper money policy, leading to the flight of capital and market chaos. Without sowing good causes, how can one expect good results? It is indeed regrettable. Now, the Association has boldly put forward the idea of increasing chips, designing comprehensively and elaborating in detail, so that the general public knows that the current lack of chips is a lack of credit chips, not a lack of payment chips. It also clarifies that the remedy lies in transforming stagnation into circulation. Recognizing that industrial securities and bills are credit chips in the modern financial market, it proposes to replace the current factory mortgage with acceptance of corporate bonds, to replace the current movable property mortgage with bank acceptance drafts, and to replace the current credit loans with commercial acceptance drafts, thereby establishing a modern credit system and promoting modern credit chips. This is visionary, insightful, and addresses the current problems. However, although the above three are all ways to transform the financial industry's investment methods, their implementation may differ in difficulty, urgency, and order. Therefore, I offer my humble opinion for your consideration: (1) Although the organization of a guarantee company is governed by special laws enacted by the government and must be registered with and supervised by the competent authorities, it is feared that not many can truly disclose their internal situation. Therefore, if we hope that its own stocks or issued bonds will circulate in the market, there will be the following two difficulties: A. The funds of our country's companies mostly range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands at most. The amount is small, and circulation is difficult. Whether it is possible to issue bonds is even more problematic. B. If we want to issue corporate bonds, we must not only clearly calculate the assets and liabilities of the company itself to understand the actual value of its factory property, but also reassure the subscribers. Whether our country's existing corporate organizations can be so sound is still questionable. Therefore, to replace the current factory mortgage with the acceptance of corporate bonds, it is necessary to conduct accurate investigations, detailed statistics, and improve the organization of the company before it is possible. This cannot be achieved overnight and should be carried out by the Association and related organizations with careful planning over time. (2) Replacing credit loans with commercial acceptance drafts is relatively safer. However, because the discounting banks do not have access to rediscounting, they are hesitant to accept as many bills. Moreover, given the decline in modern industrial and commercial credit, they are even more hesitant to wait and see. Therefore, even if they try their best to promote it, they still cannot promote it to its full potential. It can be seen that we must wait directly for the national banks to quickly establish a rediscounting system, and fundamentally establish the economic credit of industry and commerce. (3) The most painful problem for industry and commerce now is the difficulty in turning over goods and the lack of acceptance of mortgages. Because the company's capital has mostly been consumed on real estate, machinery, and productive assets, and in recent years, most of them have overused the assets, there is naturally insufficient liquid capital for business operations. In addition to borrowing from banks and money shops, they mostly rely on goods as chips to mortgage for cash. Since the financial turmoil last year, credit loans have been out of the question. Even goods that were previously used as chips are now being rejected for cash loans from banks and money shops, regardless of the discount. Goods are difficult to sell for the time being, resulting in closure due to lack of turnover. In essence, there are no losses. This situation is most regrettable. The reason why banks and money shops refuse to accept goods for mortgage is nothing more than two reasons: A. They are unable to protect themselves and are afraid that no one will accept the re-pledge, so they have to keep cash on hand to prepare for emergencies. B. They are afraid that the market price will fall too quickly, and the mortgaged goods will be difficult to sell for cash if they are not redeemed by the due date. Or, they are worried that the mortgaged goods are not reliable and that the estimated value is not accurate. If bank acceptance drafts are promoted, the goods will be stored in the bank's godown and completely possessed by the bank. The chips used are fixed-term bills. There is no need to prepare cash before the due date. If there are concerns about the reliability of the mortgaged goods, the accuracy of the valuation, and the appropriateness of the discount, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can dispatch leaders from various industries to form a committee to provide consultation to banks and money shops and assist them in handling all matters. Since the difficulties encountered by mortgaged goods are eliminated, the banks and money shops will naturally be happy to promote them. The central bank's rediscounting will also have no concerns. Therefore, among the three options in the original opinion letter, option B is the easiest to implement and is also what industry and commerce most eagerly hope for. To transform stagnation into circulation, there is no better plan than this. I dare to ask that we address the most urgent needs first, conduct research, and promote them thoroughly. The banks, money shops, industry, and commerce will all benefit. What could be more fortunate?</p>
<h3 id="e107">Municipal Police Bureau Expediting Filling of Opium Addict Licenses <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, since the Municipal Police Bureau began registering opium addicts, the registration has been extremely enthusiastic, as reported previously. However, it has been found that all opium addicts who had previously voluntarily applied to the bureau for registration or who had been investigated and advised to register had not yet been issued addiction licenses and were instead issued temporary receipts. To expedite the filling of limited-term rehabilitation licenses for opium addicts to facilitate their receipt of the licenses, starting this month, Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the Opium Addict Registration Section, will supervise the clerks to expedite the filling of licenses day and night, even on weekly holidays. It is said that a batch of rehabilitation licenses has already been completed and will be distributed to various branch offices and stations in the coming days for distribution to the opium addicts under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Municipal Police Bureau has extended the opium addict registration period in the city by one month, and more than 8,000 people have now registered. However, it is feared that some citizens do not fully understand the meaning of opium addict registration, so they are still hesitant to register voluntarily. Amidst the city's strict prohibition of opium, the advisory registration period will end at the end of this month, and compulsory registration will be implemented next month. The tolerance period is only temporary. It seems that it is necessary to make the general public thoroughly understand the meaning of registration. Therefore, they are rushing to produce dozens of opium addict registration Q&amp;A, using simple language in a Q&amp;A format to explain and elaborate on the purpose of the city's opium addict registration, so as to achieve a propaganda effect. Once compiled, they will be distributed to citizens throughout the city.</p>

They will travel to Hankou on the Jian Guo ship on the 3rd. It is also reported that as the floodwaters in the disaster areas gradually recede, many drowned corpses are awaiting burial. The Society has brought burial equipment for this purpose. Furthermore, due to the prevalence of epidemics in the disaster areas, a large quantity of medicine has been prepared for relief. However, the disaster area is too vast and funds are running short. They urgently hope that all sectors of society will provide as much assistance as possible.</p>

<p>This year's floods have spread across several provinces. The floods are rampant, and houses are left desolate. The Shanghai Charity Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces is working hard to solicit donations, with great success. Yesterday, a person named Dong Huanchen sent a letter to the association. As a cook, he was deeply saddened by the floods in various regions. However, due to his limited means, he saved two yuan from his expenses to purchase stamps and donate them, expressing his intention to help. In this declining world, with morality lost and all industries stagnant, and people living in poverty, Mr. Dong, despite being a hardworking cook, still managed to save and donate generously in the face of this great disaster. This shows that the Chinese people have not lost their compassion, and such acts of kindness will surely inspire others in society. The original letter is attached below: "To the esteemed Association, I recently heard that the floods have affected several provinces. As a citizen, I share in the collective grief. As a cook, I lack the means to provide assistance. Over the past two months, I saved two silver coins that were to be used to buy shoes, and purchased these stamps to send to your esteemed Association. Please accept them. Sincerely, Citizen Dong Huanchen."</p>

Hu Wenhu, advisor of the Malaysian-Chinese Team, Lin Qingyuan, and overseas Chinese businessman Liang Shengnan will travel to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangzhou and other places for inspection, and will not return with the athletes. Lin Qingyuan resigned from his position as a member of the British Colonial government because he opposed Qian Xingdu's policy on overseas Chinese education. Liang Shengnan also sold his Ipoh tin mine. Therefore, Lin and Liang returned to China with Hu to invest and establish a Chinese industrial company to develop domestic industries.</p>

Article 5 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law also has specific provisions. All items traditionally or annually listed with the name, quantity, and value of goods given to customers as the basis for payment are considered invoices and should be stamped according to item 3 of the tax rate table.

<h3 id="e118">Report from the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association: 5% of Chinese People Have Tuberculosis; Medical Expenses Reach 32 Million Per Year; Spitting Everywhere is Like Setting Up a Machine Gun at an Intersection <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The China Anti-Tuberculosis Association held a members' gathering at the YMCA on Sichuan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, reporting on the association's work over the past year and discussing future activities. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>These included Lu Bohong, Chairman of the Association; Li Tingan, Vice Chairman; Tong Xingmen, Secretary-General; Fang Kan, physician from the Red Cross Hospital; Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University; and over 300 members and guests. Lu Bohong, Li Tingan, and Tong Xingmen were elected as chairmen to preside over the meeting. Chairman Lu Bohong gave a report.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>He briefly stated that the Association was founded on the proposal of Mayor Wu and has been in existence for over a year. With the support of various parties and the efforts of the members, although there have been no remarkable achievements, a spirit of continuous effort can be seen everywhere. However, he himself is very busy and will need the assistance of Mr. Li Tingan and all the members in the future. The biggest goal of the Association's future work is to establish a tuberculosis hospital. A site of 100 mu has already been found. He hopes that charitable individuals will provide more assistance to complete this task. Li Tingan then gave a speech, and Tong Xingmen reported on the association's work. The People's Singing Society and Qinghua Middle School sang anti-tuberculosis songs and songs urging people not to spit.</p>
<p>Liu's Speech</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen gave a speech, stating that he recently saw in foreign magazines the proportion of tuberculosis patients in Europe, America, and Japan. In Europe, there are 107 people per 10,000; in America, there are 68 people per 10,000; and in Japan, there are 106 people per 10,000. According to recent statistics, there are 500 people per 10,000 in China. Therefore, the incidence of tuberculosis in China is higher than in any other country in the world. Most of those who die from tuberculosis are middle-aged people between the ages of 20 and 40, who are the backbone of the country. According to recent statistics from the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the money lost due to treating tuberculosis averages 32 million yuan per year. Therefore, whether in terms of human loss or financial loss, tuberculosis is a great scourge in China. Therefore, we must all rise up to prevent it.</p>
<p>Dr. Fang Discusses the Process of Examining Tuberculosis Sputum. He briefly stated that the association was commissioned by the Anti-Tuberculosis Association to examine the sputum spat by pedestrians on the road. A total of 120 sputum samples were collected from ten roads, including Yuyuan Road, Haig Road, and Jing'an Temple Road. After examination, 10% of them contained tuberculosis bacteria, averaging one sample per road. The danger is as great as setting up a machine gun on every road.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Ding Xijun Invents a Calendar Clock; It Can Automatically Indicate Large Months, Small Months, Leap Months, Etc., Accurately <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Xijun has recently invented a calendar clock after 12 years of painstaking research. After repeated tests, the results are amazing. He has made a model of the calendar clock for people to see. In addition to telling the time, it can automatically and accurately indicate large months, small months, regular months, leap months, the seven luminaries, the twelve branches of the day and night, etc., without human intervention, and will remain accurate for many years. All existing calendars will be obsolete from now on, and the calculation of time, weeks, months, and years will be much easier. The clock has a simple and ingenious structure and beautiful decoration. The explanation of its function is as follows: "Month Recording": The lunar calendar circles the earth monthly. It has excess and shortcomings and cannot correspond to the 24 solar terms. The national calendar divides the earth's orbit around the sun into twelve parts, which roughly corresponds to the 24 solar terms, but the earth actually orbits the sun for 365 and a quarter days, and one day accumulates every four years, so a "February 29th" is added every leap year to correspond to it. This calendar clock can naturally switch and report the large month, the average February, and even the leap day every four years, without error and without human assistance. Day Recording: The Earth's rotation in front of the sun is equal to one day and one night. After running for twenty-four hours, this calendar clock will naturally change the date, whether it's a big month or a small month at the end of the month due to different gear structures. The calendar will naturally agree, "Week Recording": Since the custom of one rest day every seven days spread, East Asia called it one week. The seven celestial bodies are combined, namely the Sun, Moon, Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth. A week is seven days, commonly referred to as Monday, Tuesday, etc. This calendar clock can indicate what day of the week it is every day, and which day of the week, clear and understandable. Time Recording: The Earth's meridian rotation around the sun is one day, which can also be said that the sun surrounds the earth, which is the principle of a boat sailing on the shore. Anciently, one day was divided into twelve hours, and now it is divided into twenty-four hours. In addition to reporting 24 hours, this calendar clock has a solar sphere indicating the twelve branches for practical use. The rest, the minute hand and the fixed moment are generally the same as ordinary clocks and will not be described separately.</p>

<p>Chinese and foreign detectives of the Huishan Patrol Room cracked a morphine injection den at No. 33, Lane 70, Huaji Road, and arrested the principal offender, Li Fu of Tongzhou, and Wang Yonggui, Yang Rongsheng, Zhang Yongqing, and others who were going to inject morphine, along with five syringes, morphine copper coins, and silver coins. They were taken to the patrol room and handed over to the First Special District Court. The offenders were unkempt, barefoot, and dressed in rags and tatters.

<h3 id="e121">Fire on Guangzhao Road, Zhabei; Over 100 Houses Destroyed <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the dry weather, fires have been frequent, especially in Zhabei. Most of the buildings burned are thatched cottages of the poor. Rice straw is flammable, and the thatched cottages are close together. Therefore, every fire is difficult to extinguish. This has been seen repeatedly in the winter months. At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out again in the slum area next to the Yilong Cotton Mill, opposite the Guangdong Guild Hall on Guangzhao Road, Zhabei. The fire started at the home of Yin Chunliu, a peddler from Funing, who was careless while cooking breakfast and left the fire unattended in the rice straw. The fire quickly spread to the surrounding houses. The residents woke up from their dreams in panic and fled in haste. Some carried boxes and suitcases, while others helped the elderly and carried the young. The cries and shouts were overwhelming, and the order was disrupted. At this time, the fire intensified and spread to brick houses and buildings. The flames shot into the sky, turning the sky red. The Haifeng Road Police Station nearby heard the alarm and immediately notified the Zhabei fire brigades in various sections. Fire engines rushed to the scene to put out the fire. All the firefighters were brave and eager, and they sprayed water from all directions. The fire was gradually extinguished at around 6:00 AM. As a result, 32 thatched cottages and 29 brick houses were destroyed, totaling over 120 households. The loss was enormous. Yin Chunliu, who started the fire, was taken to the police station for questioning and temporarily detained for further investigation. However, the victims, having lost their homes, became homeless. They sat on the ground near the scene of the disaster, looking emaciated and miserable.</p>

<h3 id="e133">A Scene of Urban Crime: Deceiving a Woman, Selling Her as a Prostitute, and Then Stealing Her Money Through a Sleight of Hand. Mrs. Wang Jiang Lost Both Her Daughter and Her Money, Crying Bitterly. The Two Criminals Were Finally Arrested, and the Court Should Severely Punish Them. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Wang Jiang, a Ningbo woman residing on Xiaoshadu Road, has a daughter named A Bao, seventeen years old, who used to work in a yarn factory. The daughter is beautiful and frivolous, and has had an ambiguous relationship with a male colleague. Although Mrs. Wang had heard about it, she could not control her. Recently, she was laid off from the factory and was unemployed at home. Mother and daughter found it difficult to maintain their livelihood. On the 28th of last month, a fellow villager named Bai Yisheng visited her house for a chat and, after learning about the situation, took the opportunity to take Mrs. Wang and A Bao to the Hua'an Hotel on Hankou Road to stay temporarily. He colluded with the fugitive Wei Niuzi to sell A Bao to Wu Asi, a Jiangbei native at 1056 Beijiangxi Road, as a prostitute. Zeng Laofu, from Danyang, joined in as an impartial witness. The price was 175 silver dollars, but the contract stated a loan of 400 dollars. Mrs. Wang received 150 dollars, with the remaining amount being fees for those who wrote the contract. Seeing that Mrs. Wang was foolish and gullible, they immediately handed over 150 silver dollars in banknotes for A Bao's body. Bai Yisheng wrapped them in paper, hired a rickshaw, and told Mrs. Wang to sit on it, telling her to be careful and return home quickly. He then handed over the paper package. Mrs. Wang was very satisfied, put it in her pocket, and went home. When she opened it, the contents of the package had disappeared. She realized that Bai and the others had used a sleight of hand to steal the money. The brothel on Beijiangxi Road also did not recognize her. Having lost both her daughter and her money, she could only cry bitterly. At about 3 PM the day before yesterday, Mrs. Wang passed by Bazhi Road and got into a dispute with Wu Asi and Zeng Laofu. Fang Fucheng, a Cantonese detective, investigated and, after learning the details, arrested them and took them to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. He then went to Wu's house on Beijiangxi Road, retrieved the girl Wang A Bao, and handed her back to her mother. Yesterday morning, Wu and Zeng were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the events and requested a postponement. Detective Fang then reported on the arrest of the two defendants, presenting the contract for the sale of Wang's daughter. Mrs. Wang and her daughter A Bao also clarified everything. Wu Asi and Zeng Laofu stammered in their confessions. Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Invention by the China Educational Equipment Factory: Month, Day, Week, Hour Clock. Announcing the Hour, the Time of Day, the Date, the Weekday, and the Month. The Ministry of Industry Granted a Patent and Issued an Award License. The Ministry of Finance Approved an Additional Reward and Exempted it from Transit Tax. <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The China Educational Equipment Manufacturing Factory, established by the China Bookstore on Kunming Road, Shanghai, manufactures physical and chemical instruments, specimens, and models, selling them at low prices to enrich the experimental equipment of schools and factories. It has been praised by both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Industry. Now, it has newly invented a "Month, Day, Week, Hour Clock." Its components are completely self-made, and even the smallest nail or copper sheet is not imported. Foreign countries do not yet have this invention. In addition to reporting the hours, the clock can automatically report the time of day, the date, the day of the week, and the month. Therefore, after purchasing this clock, one can know the current month, day, day of the week, and time of day at a glance. The outer appearance of the clock is generally similar to that of an ordinary clock (see picture). Its distinguishing feature is that the numbers on the clock face have two circles, inner and outer, indicating the hours from 1 to 24. At the bottom of the clock face is a time-of-day face, marking the twelve time periods of Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, etc. It rotates once every twenty-four hours, turning one time period every two hours. Each time period is further divided into early, middle, and late. In the middle of the clock face is a semi-circle with red and blue circular faces representing the sun and the moon, and their appearance and disappearance can indicate the approximate time of day. At the bottom of the clock are mechanisms for reporting the month, date, and day of the week, with three cloth strips separately marking the date, day of the week, and month. The date cloth strip is in the center, moving once every midnight, and returning to the first day of the month at the end of the month. The weekday cloth strip is on the left, also moving once every midnight, and returning to Sunday after Saturday has passed. The month cloth strip is on the right, moving once at the end of each month, and returning to the first month of the year at the end of the year. All of these are automatically converted without error. The clock is divided into nine categories, each with large, medium, and small sizes. Currently, the medium-sized, second model is being produced in large quantities and sold at a special price. The list price is 160 yuan per clock, and the special price is 96 yuan. It is guaranteed for five years and repaired free of charge. An application for a patent has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and approved. The Ministry of Finance has specially approved exemption from transit tax and stated in its approval, "The Month, Day, Week, Hour Clock manufactured by the factory has been investigated and reported to have an exquisite design and a wide range of uses. There is little such manufacturing in the country, and it is worthy of encouragement." Its value is evident. Those interested in viewing the clock are welcome to visit the China Bookstore's headquarters or local branches for clarification. If you wish to inspect whether the clock is a domestic invention and self-made, the factory welcomes visits from all circles at any time. Please contact the public relations department of the China Bookstore headquarters.</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Municipal Tobacco Exchange Association has received repeated reports from members in recent days that someone has been falsely using the name of a Yuntaihe Tobacco Company runner to collect empty "Little Fairy" cigarette packs from small shops, exchanging nine for ten cigarettes, packing them in small bags or exchanging them loosely. However, less than a day after the exchange, they are inspected by Shanghai inspectors, who determine that they are counterfeit, and are detained and sent to the police for punishment. There have been several such cases every day. In order to protect against being deceived and punished, the office yesterday issued another notice to its members, stating: "We have learned that there are many brands of cigarettes sold by our colleagues. Recently, some unscrupulous elements have been falsely claiming to be company runners, coming to sell counterfeit 'Little Fairy' cigarettes and other brands. Although this office has issued three notices, some people have not paid attention and have been deceived and punished. Therefore, we are issuing an urgent notice. If there are cigarettes being sold door-to-door, we hope that shopkeepers will pay attention to avoid being deceived and fined. If anyone continues to sell the aforementioned counterfeit cigarettes in front of you, please pay attention and hand them over to the police. Otherwise, once caught, they will be subject to a large fine. Do not neglect and harm yourself. This is a crucial notice."</p>

<p>The Meifeng Tobacco and Alcohol Store and JOS'E Bar are both located at the intersection of Ya'erpei Road and Central Sports Field. A man named Li Mingshu, in his teens, worked as a waiter in JOS'E Bar. Yesterday around 8 PM, Li was sent by the store owner to buy something at Meifeng. He happened to meet Wu Xiaosizi, an employee of Meifeng, and since they were very familiar, they chatted casually. They teased each other in their words, but unexpectedly, Wu Xiaosizi became angry and slapped Li on the cheek. Li, being young, felt wronged and returned to the store with tears in his eyes, complaining to the store owner. It happened to be seen by a foreigner in the bar, who was already drunk. He stood up and forced Li Mingshu to go to Meifeng to negotiate. Unexpectedly, as soon as the foreigner entered Meifeng, he slapped Wu Xiaosizi on the cheek. Wu Xiaosizi tried to resist, but the foreigner immediately pulled out a self-defense pistol from his side and fired at Wu. Wu Xiaosizi saw this and quickly turned to avoid it, but it was too late. The bullet entered through his back and exited through his chest, and he immediately fell to the ground in the store. The police post was nearby, and hearing the gunshot, they rushed into the store to inquire. Seeing the situation, they immediately telegraphed the police station and notified the fire brigade to send Wu Xiaosizi to the hospital for treatment. However, the injury was fatal, and he soon died. The body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The foreigner who caused the accident and Li Mingshu were both taken into custody by the police.</p>

<p>The Yuantong Shipping Bureau at 494 Beisuzhou Road has seven ships: Yuanxiang, Yuanji, Yuanyuan, Yuanfa, Yuantong, Yuanfeng, and Yuanchang, all of the Shenhu class. The Yuanfeng steamer left Shanghai for Huzhou at 11:30 AM on the 30th of last month.

The captain, forced by force, had no choice but to stop sailing. All thirty-odd passengers were not spared, and the silver dollars and clothes they carried were robbed, worth about seven or eight hundred dollars. The account room lost 500 paper dollars. The entire robbery lasted for about an hour, and then the bandits left with their loot. Once the bandits left, the captain continued sailing as usual. After arriving in Huzhou, he immediately telegraphed the report of the robbery. After the Pingwang Public Security Bureau received the alarm, it immediately dispatched water police to rush to the scene, but the bandits had already carried their loot far away.

However, the Yuanfeng steamer still sailed from Shanghai to Huzhou as usual yesterday afternoon.

<p>The Shanghai Magazine Company publishes the first edition of "Striking the Table in Amazement," the fourth part of the Rare Literary Books of China series. It consists of 36 volumes, written by Ling Mengchu of the Ming Dynasty. The "Three Words and Two Beats" is a comprehensive collection of Ming Dynasty novels, which was very popular at the time. After entering the Qing Dynasty, it was banned and lost circulation for a long time. Later generations only knew of the "Stories Old and New," which was selected and compiled, and no longer knew of the "Three Words and Two Beats." It can be said that they have forgotten their origins. The series aims to restore the old appearance at the cost of huge sums of money, collecting rare and good editions from various sources, carefully punctuating and proofreading them, and publishing them continuously. The complete book contains 400,000 words, divided into two thick volumes, and comes with a book cover for easy storage. It was published today. The retail price for the entire set is only 7 jiao. A special edition printed on thick pound Huangdaolin paper costs 1 yuan. Mail orders are postage-free.

The popular edition costs 17 yuan, and the special edition costs 24 yuan. For out-of-town orders, add 1 yuan and 5 jiao for postage. On average, each book costs only a little over 3 jiao, which can be said to be extremely cheap. The reservation period ends at the end of this month.

<p>A list of the number of classes and schools with students enrolled at the beginning of the first literacy school term</p>
<p>2. Inspection Situation: The inspection of the municipal literacy schools in this city is divided into three categories: 1. Inspection by the municipal government; 2. Inspection by the Municipal Literacy Education Committee; 3. Inspection by the offices of each district. The inspection by the municipal government is carried out by the staff of the municipal government. One inspection director is appointed for each literacy education district or several literacy education districts, for a total of 11 directors. In addition, more than 40 inspectors are appointed to be responsible for inspecting the literacy schools throughout the city. Each inspection director inspects for two weeks per term, and each inspector inspects for two to four weeks per term. All inspection situations are written into inspection reports and submitted to the mayor, who then forwards them to the Literacy Education Committee, which in turn informs the offices of each district and forwards them to each literacy school to improve operations. If there are too many student absences or poor order, the municipal government will also order the Public Security Bureau or its branches to correct or assist in correcting the situation. The inspection by the Municipal Literacy Education Committee is carried out by the executive officers of the committee. A total of inspections are carried out throughout the term. One is at the beginning of the term to inspect the opening situation of each school. One is in the middle of the term to inspect the attendance of students, check the number of students attending each school, and provide guidance on the school's general situation, facilities, teaching methods, moral education achievements, student situation reports, etc. The inspection by the offices of each district is carried out by the members of the academic affairs committees of each district. Except for the Zhonghua Confucian Temple and Pusong districts, which refer to and separately formulate forms, most adopt the Municipal Literacy Education Committee's inspection report form and inspect once to three times per month, and submit it to the Literacy Education Committee for verification at the end of the term. After the above three types of inspections, the final results are collected by the Municipal Literacy Education Committee for overall review and verification in order to unify authority. It is believed that the language, attitude, and teaching methods of the teachers are greatly related to the increase or decrease of students, but the literacy schools use the original schools or public places as school sites, and their facilities and environment are often inadequate, which affects the teaching performance. As for student absences, investigating and preparing reports and police summons are time-consuming and costly, which is also a major factor affecting teaching efficiency. (To be continued)</p>

This is truly a great undertaking. Mr. Hu, Lin and Wang are not only leaders of the overseas Chinese, but also care about the motherland and are particularly enthusiastic about social welfare and charitable causes, which have long been admired by the people of the country. This time, they have led young overseas Chinese from afar to return to the motherland to visit the country in addition to participating in the All-China Games, so that they can have a deep impression of the motherland's political construction, etc. Its significance is profound.

<p>Hu Wenhu Speaks</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu expressed his views on participating in the All-China Games on the ship, saying: "This time, I, Wenhu, led the Malayan Chinese team back to the country to participate in the Sixth National Games, with nearly 150 male and female athletes and staff. It is the largest organization of overseas Chinese returning to the country for sightseeing in history. Although its surface purpose is the same as that of the provinces and cities participating, its significance seems to be slightly different. Now, I will briefly describe one or two of my humble opinions, and I hope that the people of the country will appreciate them. The physique of our people is weak, and we have been ridiculed as the 'sick men of East Asia.' I believe that if we want to revitalize the spirit of our nation, we should first strengthen the physique of our people. It is impossible to succeed without actively promoting sports. The holding of the All-China Games allows the athletes of the whole country to gather in one place, learn from each other, and promote sports. Its function is the greatest. Malayan Chinese sports are still in their infancy, so I, Wenhu, advocate that the number of selected participants should be large and that all sections should be equal, so that the athletes and staff who return to the country will not only improve their sports skills, but also use their gained experience in the future to develop the cause of sports. Their gains will be far from small. This is the first significance of the Malayan team returning to the country to participate in the All-China Games. Overseas Chinese have left the country for thousands of miles, and there is a great deal of separation from the situation in the motherland. Even among the athletes who have returned to the country this time, most of them are overseas Chinese students who have never set foot in the motherland. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to participate in the All-China Games, they return to the country for sightseeing, so that they can have a deeper understanding of the motherland, which can communicate the voices of China and Southeast Asia and harmonize the feelings of inside and outside. This is the second significance of the Malayan team participating in the All-China Games. This All-China Games is held in Shanghai, which is the most cultural and historical area in our country. Culture, education, and other industrial and commercial industries are all the best in the country. In addition to the competition, the Malayan Chinese team will conduct various inspections. Their feelings and impressions will be good, and their gains will be considerable. This is another significance of the Malayan Chinese team participating in the All-China Games. As for the establishment of championships in the Games, it is a method to promote technology. Malayan Chinese sports have not been promoted for a long time, and their achievements are still immature. Victory is not something we dare to expect, and the championship is not the purpose of this trip. We only hope that the domestic talents will come forward to teach us, then it will be fortunate."</p>

Today, Mr. Li decided to play the old tune again, using his more and more refined technology to give Shanghai fans the pleasure of watching. Today, Shenyuan will be full of people.

<h3 id="e162">Hubei Athletes Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, A Group of Sixty-Four People Led by Liu Changhe, The Men's Basketball Team and Track and Field Teams Have Many Famous Players and Their Strength is Considerable <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Province delegation to the All-China Games, consisting of sixty-four people led by General Leader Liu Changhe, arrived in Shanghai on the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangxin wheel since the second day and arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday. They immediately reported to the General Assembly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The Jiang'an wheel docked at the Xinkaihe Wharf at 11:00 AM. More than one hundred fellow villagers from Hubei in Shanghai arrived to welcome them. A total of sixty-four staff and athletes disembarked and took a special bus from the All-China Games to the city center to report to the General Assembly. The team's athletes did not have outerwear, so they wore casual clothes, but the underwear was completely uniform.</p>
<p>Basketball is the Strongest</p>
<p>The province participated in men's and women's track and field, men's and women's basketball, tennis, and football. The men's basketball team has many fierce generals such as Liu Zhenyuan and others, and their strength is considerable. They can compete with teams such as Beijing and Hebei. The championship is expected to be achieved. The track and field team has the Iron Bull Chen Baoqiu, the Jumping King Wu Bixian, and others, and their strength is also strong. According to the General Leader of the team, Liu Changhe, the team attaches importance to the spirit of participating in the All-China Games, and victory or defeat is secondary. If the spirit is good, then even if they lose, they will be glorious. If the spirit is not good, then even if they win, they will be humiliated. The team follows this principle, so they take care of the spirit of sports everywhere, he said.</p>
<p>List of Staff</p>
<p>The list of athletes has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. The list of staff of the team is recorded as follows: General Leader Liu Changhe, Deputy General Leader Ke Nanshan, Men's Track and Field Coach Yang Wenping, Women's Track and Field Coach Yuan Wenfeng, Men's Basketball Coach Song Ruhai, Women's Basketball Coach Wang Wenpu, Football Coach Zeng Zichen, Tennis Coach Yuan Ling, Manager Ke Nanshan, Meng Shoupeng, Ye Qixiu, Document Li Liangong, Affairs Bai Zhongyou.</p>

<p>Tennis player Xu Chengji and his brother Chengwei and others will represent Java at the All-China Games this time. They took the Zha Zhibade wheel to Shanghai and are scheduled to arrive at the port at 12:30 PM today. More than 30 athletes in the second batch from Hong Kong also came with them. The owner of Rongpu, Chen Bingqian, is the father of Chen Qihao, who loves tennis. He usually serves the society and is very enthusiastic. This time, the fellow villager came to participate in the All-China Games to win glory for his hometown, and he specifically hosted a banquet for Li Huitang, He Jialiu, the Xu brothers and the newly arrived Hong Kong and Guangdong football team leaders and athletes at the Chen family garden Rongpu, No. 357 Haige Road, at noon tomorrow (Monday, the 7th), and also invited the Cantonese overseas Chinese leaders in this city to accompany him. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, and Section Chief Li are also among those invited. A performance will be held after the banquet. Xu Chengji will also partner with the ball king Li Huitang to play doubles against He Jialiu and Xu Weipei. The order of the remaining singles and mixed doubles will be determined temporarily, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Shanghai Tennis Exhibition Match: Lin vs. Xu Weipei, Chen Qihan vs. Wang Wenzheng – Singles and Doubles, Three Groups Starting at 1:30 PM <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>To promote interest in tennis among the Shanghai populace, the Shanghai Tennis Club, taking advantage of the presence of top tennis players from across the country for the National Games, has invited famous players from Sichuan, Malaya, and Shanghai to put on an exhibition at the club's courts on Kangti Road. Yesterday was the first day, featuring one women's doubles match and two men's singles matches. It was anticipated that many would come to admire the players, but the weather was unfavorable. From a little after 1:00 PM, it drizzled, resulting in a sparse crowd of fewer than a hundred people, which dampened the enthusiasm somewhat. The results of the matches are as follows:</p>
<p>The Wei Sisters Easily Defeat Zhao-Li</p>
<p>At exactly 2:00 PM, the women's doubles match began. Facing off were the Shanghai duo of Wei Zutong and Wei Maigu against the Sichuan pair of Zhao Yunhua and Li Yuping. The Sichuan ladies displayed decent skill, and their backhand was commendable. However, the Wei sisters showed superior teamwork, with excellent shots and volleys. Their net play proved particularly effective, often sealing the opponents' fate. After a hard-fought battle, Zhao and Li only managed to win one game in the second set. The Wei sisters won two straight sets with scores of 6-0 and 6-1.</p>
<p>Wang and Qian Cooperate to Resist De and Chen</p>
<p>Next to take the court were Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin against De Fu and Chen Zhiqiang in men's doubles. According to the original schedule, De Fu was supposed to pair with football star Li Huitang. However, Li was scheduled to represent the Hong Kong football team in a match against the Western Police today and needed to conserve his energy, so Chen Zhiqiang replaced him. At the beginning of the match, both sides were evenly matched, each losing their serve. However, due to De and Chen’s lack of coordination, errors were inevitable, giving the opponents opportunities to attack. Wang and Qian, not willing to relax, displayed great courage and won five straight games, winning the first set 6-1. From the second set onward, De and Chen, mindful of the disastrous first set, fought valiantly and won two consecutive games. Wang and Qian, recognizing that their opponents were not weak, quickly caught up, winning three games. De and Chen responded, winning three straight games to take a 5-3 lead. During this period, the two sides engaged in tactical exchanges, creating many exciting moments and earning continuous applause. Wang and Qian, seeing the dangerous situation, played cautiously and indeed won three games, taking a 6-5 lead. In the next game, De Fu served, resulting in repeated ties. After 8-8 and then 9-8, Wang and Qian consistently held the advantage. However, at this point, Wang Wenzheng showed signs of fatigue, and De and Chen took advantage, winning three games in a row to win the second set 11-9. Since it was getting late and there were still two singles exhibitions to be played, the match ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Karlson Defeats Qiu Feihai Again</p>
<p>Old Qiu is old and powerless. His loss to the strong and healthy Karlson was naturally expected. When he took the court, old Qiu was still able to rally and put up a fight. His signature baseline drives, deep into the corners, often trapped his opponent in difficult positions. As a result, he led 4-3. However, he soon showed signs of fatigue, and Karlson won a game, giving him the first set 6-4. In the second set, old Qiu won the first game, but then he lacked the strength to run, his shots were weak, and his control was almost nonexistent. Karlson, on the other hand, became more and more courageous, manipulating the game with ease, and won the second set 6-2.</p>
<p>Xu Weipei Slightly Defeats Kolaša</p>
<p>In the final match, Xu Weipei faced Kolaša. By this time, the rain was getting heavier, and the audience was dispersing, but the match continued despite the rain. The two players were evenly matched, but Xu Weipei was slightly superior, so Xu won two straight sets with scores of 8-6 and 6-3. In the first set, Xu took an early lead of 3-1 and 4-2. Later, Kolaša caught up and took a 5-4 lead. Xu served and created a breakpoint, and Kolaša took a 6-5 lead. Finally, Xu rallied and quickly won three games, winning 8-6. In the second set, Kolaša took an early lead of 3-2. Later, due to the darkening sky, he played hastily and was defeated by Xu, who won four games in a row and won the second set 6-3.</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu and Others Will Play Today</p>
<p>Today's schedule has already been set. Malayan champion Lin Wangsu arrived in Shanghai yesterday, so today will be even more spectacular. However, Li Huitang will still be absent, as he is participating in a football match. The order is as follows: (starting at 1:30 PM) Men's singles: Chen Qihan vs. Wang Wenzheng, Lin Wangsu vs. Xu Weipei Men's doubles: Carlson and De Fu vs. He Jialiu and Qiu Feihai</p>

Students from each school arrived by special bus before 3:00 PM and gathered in front of Gumin Road. After a short rest, the exercises began. The audience numbered 500 to 600. All the students wore the prescribed white Tai Chi exercise uniforms, short-sleeved collared shirts and shorts, and black shoes and socks. They were divided into 60 teams, each with 50 students and a team flag. The lines for each team were marked in advance with white lines, so the formation was quite orderly. Then, Mr. Chu gave the order to start the exercises. The neat uniforms and synchronized movements made for a spectacular performance. It was truly the first grand occasion since the completion of the National Games venue.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Ordinary Performance; Shanghai Wins Against British Inness; the 4-2 Situation Was Very Tense; More Effort Is Needed for the Football Championship <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai football team played its final practice match against the British Army Inness at Shen Garden yesterday afternoon, with the Shanghai players winning 4-2. In the first half, the Shanghai players took a 2-1 lead. Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people watched.</p>
<p>MacFarlane Scores First</p>
<p>Shanghai kicked off first. For the first five minutes, the teams remained deadlocked, carefully watching each other, making it difficult to score. The British army suddenly launched an attack, and MacFarlane bravely took the lead, launching a solo attack on the Shanghai team's goal. It was too late to save, and the ball went into the net, leaving Zhang Rongcai helpless.</p>
<p>Jinshun Is Still Charming</p>
<p>Both sides fought fiercely. Cao Qiuting repeatedly dribbled deep, but the British defensive line was too strong and difficult to break through, and he was often intercepted. Sun Jinshun raised his arm and caught a pass from Li Yichen, kicking it forcefully. It was too late to save, and the ball went into the net. Sun's iron leg was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>Linjing Scores Lightly</p>
<p>British center MacFarlane repeatedly displayed his courage, launching solo attacks deep into the Shanghai defense. Fortunately, Feng Yunyou was stationed in the rear, handling the situation with ease and making it difficult for MacFarlane to achieve his goal. He was repeatedly intercepted. The British army, focusing solely on offense, neglected their defense, allowing Liang Shutang to attack on the left wing and pass the ball to Jia Youliang. Jia dribbled forward and crossed from the baseline, and Dai Linjing caught up and lightly tapped the ball into the net. The first half ended with Shanghai leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Jinshun Accomplishes Twice</p>
<p>Changing sides, the British Army bravely took the lead, launching a full-scale attack on the Shanghai line. Feng and Jiang tried their best to cope, but the center line was slightly weak, allowing the British army to frequently penetrate the inner defense line. Fortunately, Zhang Rongcai was willing to sacrifice himself, repeatedly saving dangerous balls. His selfless struggle was praised by the audience. However, this left the British Inness defense empty, and Dai Linjing dribbled through the British center line and entered the back defense line. It was Jinshun who made a strong shot, sending the ball into the net.</p>
<p>Kallen Returns a Goal</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes into the second half, it began to rain. The two sides continued to compete in the rain, without giving an inch. With Hall's help, Kallen returned a goal in the heavy rain, scoring successfully. Shanghai still led by two goals.</p>
<p>Iron Leg Scores Three Goals</p>
<p>For twenty minutes, the two sides engaged in a close battle, without any gains or losses. The audience cheered frequently, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Amid the cheers, Jia dribbled forward, passing it directly to Sun Jinshun. Living up to the audience's expectations, he shot the ball into the goal, but it hit the crossbar and bounced back in. The whistle blew, and the fierce battle came to an end, with a final score of 4-1.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Performance Is Ordinary</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, British Inness showed much more improvement than in the past, frequently approaching the Shanghai goal. However, their center line was too weak and lacked stability. If the British Inness shots had been more accurate, there would have been a new situation. Furthermore, the Shanghai team's forwards lacked activity on the left and right wings, and the ball was mostly advanced through the center, which was not a perfect tactic and should be paid attention to. Based on yesterday's performance, the Shanghai team's prospects for winning the football championship at the National Games are not optimistic.</p>

<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanqing</p>

<p>A brand new, clean piece of clothing is put on, and after not many days, when you take it off and look closely, the other parts are still fine, but only the "collar" and "cuffs" are the dirtiest. When Mom washes them, she uses extra effort, so they are most easily damaged. This is of course also expected.</p>
<p>Originally, the "collar" holds the central position of the whole garment, with the sole responsibility of maintaining its main body. The "cuffs" move with the all-powerful hands, working the most, so it's no wonder they are the most easily soiled. However, because they are the most easily soiled, their duties are naturally the most important!</p>
<p>A piece of clothing cannot do without the "collar" and "cuffs." Even an organization, a group, cannot do without "leaders." Furthermore, a modern nation cannot do without excellent and outstanding "leaders" to lead the people and maintain its sole body - the nation - like a piece of clothing, even if they are soiled or damaged to the point of destruction, they remain silent and without complaint!</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Battle of Abyssinia and Adowa <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>In recent months, no major event has surpassed the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia.</p>
<p>We are very familiar with the name of Italy because of Mussolini, the black-shirted prime minister, a globally renowned eccentric. The name of Abyssinia, however, is very unfamiliar. It is an ancient black nation located in eastern Africa, also known as Ethiopia. It is one of the three independent countries in Africa, with an area of ​​1.12 million square kilometers and a population of about 10 million. It has rich mineral resources and land suitable for cultivation and animal husbandry. The export volume of wax, ivory, and coffee is very large. The current king is Haile Selassie. Although Abyssinia is located near the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, it is completely isolated from the ocean because it is surrounded by the territories of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. From this, we can also imagine the complexity of its international relations.</p>
<p>Now, the disputes between Italy and Abyssinia not only cannot be resolved, but are becoming more profound, and the war has already broken out. The Italian army has 250,000 troops stationed in Eritrea, an Italian colony in northern Abyssinia, and in Italian Somaliland in eastern and southeastern Abyssinia. As for Abyssinia, it has expressed a very brave attitude towards Italy's aggression and oppression. The King of Abyssinia has repeatedly stated that Abyssinia must guarantee its own independence. He said, "We would rather die for freedom than live as slaves!" These are such brave words!</p>
<p>Abyssinia has hope. Although it has been placed on the chopping block to be slaughtered, it inflicted a huge blow on Italy 39 years ago (1896). As long as it can maintain its previous glory and make a final struggle, even if it perishes, it will be very glorious.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine years ago, the now prominent Mussolini was only twelve years old and was learning socialist theories from his blacksmith father. The Battle of Adowa began at this time. At that time, the Italian army had a total of 20,000 people, half of whom were local indigenous reinforcements. They advanced in three teams on the left, right, and center, and there was another team to provide support in the rear. Each team was commanded by a general. First, the Italian army occupied the two ridges facing Adowa. Later, the Abyssinian soldiers charged forward one after another, and the Italian army's cannons could not stop their advance. As a result, the entire Italian army was annihilated; two generals, 252 officers, and 4,500 soldiers were killed, 45 officers, and 1,500 soldiers were captured, and all the cannons were completely seized by the Abyssinian soldiers.</p>

<p>Fried mixed vegetable is a common dish that Min'er often eats for breakfast because he finds it crispy and fragrant.</p>
<p>But he likes to eat it very much, but doesn't know what it is made of? And how can it be crispy? Even if he looks through books, there is no record related to it.</p>
<p>"Dad, how is fried mixed vegetable made? Can you tell me?" He quickly ran to his dad to ask him.</p>
<p>"Is it fried mixed vegetable? Have you ever paid attention to when they make it in the shop on the street?"</p>
<p>"I haven't paid attention, I thought it was easy and not worth much."</p>
<p>"That's your mistake. I often say to you: "You must pay attention to everything, especially the smallest things." Since you don't know, I will tell you:</p>
<p>Fried mixed vegetable is made of wheat flour, but how does it become crispy? It is made by mixing alum and baking soda. Crispness is a chemical change, which is very mysterious, and you probably won't understand it.</p>
<p>Prepare a bowl of cold clean water, dissolve the alum in the clean water, and then dissolve the baking soda and salt in the water, stirring with a stick so that they are completely dissolved. At this time, there will be many bubbles in the bowl. Blow away the bubbles, and the clean water in the bowl will turn milky white. This milky white water is called fermented water. Then, put the very fine wheat flour in a shallow basin, pour the fermented water in, and continuously knead and mix it by hand. At this time, the wheat flour has become a paste. Then, put it on a board, make it into strips, and then cut it into small strips with a knife. Stack the two small strips together, gently press them with a wooden stick, pinch the ends with your fingers and stretch them out, and then twist them into spiral strips. Fry them in a vegetable oil pot, and after a while, they will expand and become golden brown fried mixed vegetable."</p>
<p>"Dad, what are alum and baking soda?"</p>
<p>"Alum is very similar to rock candy, and it can make dirty water clean. Baking soda helps digestion."</p>

<p>— Ouyang Gu</p>
<p>Newspaper-selling children are our most pitiful little friends! They lost their education at a young age and sell newspapers to others to read, but they can't understand the newspapers they sell. Of course, they are also willing to study, but it is a pity that there is no one to teach them. Going to noble schools is simply out of the question. Now, there is a very good news. I think the little friends are very willing to hear and support it! That is, on Weisai Road in this city, east of the little vegetable market, a "Newspaper-Selling Children's Work-Study Group" school has been established. The slogan written on the white oil green background sign at the school gate: If you study, you will be able to read the newspaper, come if you want to study! And can you read the newspaper yourself after selling it to others? These are very eye-catching slogans.</p>
<p>Speaking of the establishment of this small cultural cell, it was originally due to the collective efforts of the newspaper-selling children in that area. At first, they had classes in the open air in an alley, with four literate newspaper-selling children as little teachers. In less than two weeks, they had finished reading four volumes of Old and Young Tong. Later, the newspaper-selling children conflicted with each other due to work hours and the climate. They had to wait until after ten o'clock in the morning before they could finish selling newspapers, and they had to sell newspapers before five o'clock in the evening. All the spare time was during the time when the sun was hanging high, so they asked the neighboring literate schools in the area for assistance and rented that school house for six yuan a month. Inside, there are three Eight Immortals tables, covered with long boards. The stools are rented temporarily. Maps; blackboards and lead powder are all donated, and the books are distributed by literate schools. The four little teachers take turns volunteering to teach. They rely on selling newspapers for food, and isn't it a full study in both work and learning to seek some new wisdom every day? Moreover, in this small Work-Study Group school, they can take the spare time to study with peace of mind. Now their scope is expanding and expanding, and the number of members has increased to more than 70. There are seven little teachers in charge of the Children's Work-Study Group, and the Advanced Citizen Textbook will also be finished reading. Many of the members have already learned to read the newspapers they sell!</p>

<p>— Schoolteacher</p>
<p>Orangutans are a type of monkey. Among animals, they are considered the smartest. Although their intelligence and ingenuity are not as good as humans, their claws and teeth are more powerful than those of humans. If people want to catch live orangutans, they cannot hope to catch them empty-handed. Therefore, they use the orangutan's nature of loving imitation to trick them into catching them.</p>
<p>Once, a traveler traveled in the mountains by sedan. Halfway there, the traveler got out of the sedan and walked, looking at the scenery. The sedan bearers were tired and rested, sitting on the mountain rocks dozing off. Unexpectedly, a few orangutans, taking advantage of the people's unpreparedness, jumped down from the trees. Some squeezed into the sedan and sat, pretending to be guests, while others learned from the sedan bearers, carrying the sedan, running and jumping crookedly. By the time the people woke up, they had already thrown the sedan far away.</p>
<p>One of the sedan bearers had an idea. The next day, he invited a few hunters, brought wine and food, and carried a few sedans. They put working locks on the sedan doors and passed by the same place. They deliberately stopped the sedans, drank wine, and dispelled boredom. After a while, they deliberately left the wine and food there and wandered around.</p>
<p>When those orangutans saw that the people were gone and the sedans were empty, and the smell of wine was fragrant, they rushed forward and ate the remaining wine and food until they were drunk. Some walked into the sedan doors, either sitting or squatting. Some then came to close the sedan doors and carried the sedan to walk.</p>
<p>The waiting hunters suddenly shouted, and the orangutans were frightened and at a loss. Some fell down, and some ran away. Only the orangutans sitting in the sedans, unable to open the doors or jump out, had no choice but to be caught by the hunters.</p>
<p>This is also called "It's easy to get on stage, but it's hard to get off"!</p>

<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>A gust of cool wind suddenly flies in, announcing to us that "Autumn" has arrived in the world. What joyful news this is! The azure sky, set off by clouds like fish scales, reveals its serene grandeur even more, and our hearts become open and broad.</p>
<p>The autumn insects chirp and hum, as if they are reading diligently; children, with such good weather, shouldn't you be studying hard? Don't miss the opportunity; a little delay, and the bone-chilling winter will be here, followed by the sultry summer, and then the wearisome spring will follow closely behind. Quickly seize this lovely autumn and study hard.</p>
<p>How can we read to achieve the best results? When we read a piece of writing, we must at least connect it with speaking, composition, and writing; in this way, we can read the book, be able to speak about it, write it down, and even create something new. If we only get to the point of humming and chanting, then reading is just a pastime!</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of reading is to 'seek the truth'. When we read, we must find the candies in the book; these candies, when we eat them, are beneficial in every way and without a single drawback. The more we eat, the better the taste; the better the taste, the more we want to eat. The more we eat, the more we benefit, and we will become useful members of society.</p>
<p>Normally, we should read quietly, not aloud; in terms of practicality and efficiency, silent reading is more valuable than reading aloud, and this is something to pay attention to. Children, the great autumn has arrived, quickly study hard!</p>

<p>There is a young girl in Chicago, USA, named Man Jujian, who has been in a dream world for three and a half years, hence the title "Sleeping Beauty." She has been sleeping in a daze for years, and it is still a scientific mystery. She is under the special care of her loving mother. She contracted sleeping sickness in 1932 and struggled hard, and has only recently regained some awareness, but her mental activity is still minimal. According to her mother, her daughter's eyes can now be open for most of the day, and she can extend her fingers to answer questions about numbers, but there is no cure for this disease, so there is no certainty as to when she will fully recover. However, this loving mother does not give up hope. She told a news reporter: "My daughter's condition has improved a lot. She is making slow progress now. Her body is not as heavy as it used to be. She seems to be able to hear sounds, taste flavors, and feel pain." It is reported that the lady was twenty-six years old when she fell ill, and she is now twenty-nine years old. She began to catch a cold while lying on a train on January 19, 1932, but did not fall into a completely comatose state until mid-February. According to biologists, her nervous system has not been greatly damaged because her heart is still able to control her. This mother waits patiently, hoping day after day, recording the changes in the dream world in a small notebook every day, so that she can review it with her beautiful daughter in the future. She hopes and believes that one day she can hand this little notebook to her beloved daughter, who will be free from the shackles of the sleeping demon and as quick-witted as ever.</p>

<p>There was a girl from a foreign country who happened to live next to the railway tracks. Not far from her residence was an iron bridge, a necessary passage for trains.</p>
<p>One day, a storm struck and the bridge was damaged. She thought that when the train arrived, it would be in an unknown and dangerous situation. Her small heart felt extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>She decided to light a torch and shout and wave on this side of the bridge. When the train arrived, they heard the commotion and knew that something had happened, so they stopped the train. After investigation, they found out that the bridge was broken. This good girl saved the lives of the passengers on the train.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>A group of merchants took many goods and boarded a sea ship to do business overseas. At first, they were very harmonious, but later, some people advocated going to the northern seas, saying that the business there was very good and they could definitely make a lot of money; others advocated going to the southern seas, saying that the natives there needed their goods very much, and that the prices were high and the goods were easy to sell, so they could definitely make a lot of money. The two sides started with verbal disputes, and then turned to physical fights; the wind and waves grew bigger and bigger, and as a result, the helmsman dropped the rudder, the oarsmen threw down the oars, and everyone ran in a swarm to the deck, joining the battle and fighting together. They also ran to the cargo hold to increase their fighting strength, opened the wine that was going to be sold, and gulped it down. After drinking, they ran back to the deck to brawl. They fought desperately, each trying to kill the other, and no one was willing to give up. However, they left the ship, which everyone entrusted their lives to, to drift with the wind and run into hidden reefs.</p>
<p>While they were fighting, the weather suddenly changed. The sky was as dark as ink, lightning flashed like threads, and a violent wind roared and heavy rain poured down. The drifting ship was thrown into the air by the raging waves for a moment, and then pressed to the bottom of the waves for another. But these drunkards were still fighting! Suddenly, it seemed as if the sky and the earth had collapsed, and there was a loud noise. The ship hit a reef! The bow of the ship was broken by the reef, and water rushed in headlong...</p>
<p>At this time, a young man who had not drunk saw this scene and hurriedly ran to cover the hole with his hands; but with the water pouring in like this, how could one person's strength be enough to cover it? So he shouted loudly: "The ship is sinking! Everyone stop fighting!... Come... Come and save us..." But these drunkards were fighting vigorously on the deck, who would pay attention to him!</p>
<p>Soon, more and more water flooded the young man's thighs, and he became more and more anxious, shouting: "If you don't come to save us, the ship will sink immediately!..." But these drunkards were fighting vigorously on the deck, who would pay attention to him!</p>
<p>The young man had just shouted the last two words "sink" when the water had already flooded his chest. He shouted miserably: "You... You... If you don't... the ship... immediately..." He shouted to this point, the water poured into his throat, and at the same time the ship sank into the water, sank down..., and the people on the deck also sank down, sank down; but other than those who had already been beaten to death, the living people were still twisted together, fighting desperately...</p>

<p>After listening, he began to speak, saying: "If you were like me, a carrier pigeon, then you wouldn't have all these troubles. We only know how to travel, that is our life. We also have our love, but I don't know who my father is. Day after day, we break through the air and pass through space, watching the high mountains and plains all arranged under our feet. What we breathe is the pure air of the sky, not the turbid air of the ground. When we fly, we are like an arrow, straight to our destination, without making mistakes. This is our entertainment and also our life. The distance I travel in one day, humans can't catch up with me in ten days."</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I immediately became brave and said to him: "Sir, in that case, you are a wandering bird!"</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon replied: "This is not something I need to worry about. I have no homeland; I only know three things: my journey, my wife, and my children. Where my wife is, that is where my homeland is."</p>
<p>"But what is that hanging around your neck? It looks like a tattered piece of wrinkled paper."</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon replied, exhaling: "This is a very important document. This time I am going to Bai Luosai to bring a letter to the famous banker Mr. X, causing the currency price to fall by seven jiao eight fen in francs."</p>
<p>I cheered: "Great! Your life is really great, and that Bai Luosai city, I think it must be a city worth seeing. Can you take me with you? I am not a mountain crow, so maybe I am a carrier pigeon."</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon said: "If you were a carrier pigeon, then I just pecked you, and you have to peck me back."</p>
<p>"Sir, I can give it back to you; let's not argue over these small things. Look, the dawn is about to break. The storm has subsided. Please let me follow you! I have failed. I have nothing in this world; if you refuse me, then I will have to drown in this lake."</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon quickly said: "Very good, move forward, quickly move forward, as long as you can keep up with me, then come with me."</p>
<p>I took one last look at the garden where my mother was sleeping. A teardrop rolled out of my eyes; and it was immediately carried away by the wind and rain. I spread my wings and set off immediately.</p>
<p>I said long ago that my wings were not very strong yet. The guiding carrier pigeon flew like splashing wind, and I followed beside him, constantly panting; I tried for a while, but soon I felt a violent dizziness, almost fainting. I let out a weak voice and asked, "Is it still a long way to go"?</p>
<p>He replied: "Not far, we are already in Bao Yede; now we just need to hurry another hundred and eighty miles."</p>

<h3 id="e182">Financial Gold Reached 904 Yuan, Although Silver Prices Rose, Speculators Dared Not Act, Bank Sales Resulted in a Slight Drop of 9 Jiao <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Since the gold market was agitated by rumors the day before yesterday, the psychology of the industry continues to be uneasy, and speculators dare not act. Therefore, although silver prices rose yesterday, they were still surrounded by buying sentiment, and the high price of 904 yuan reappeared. If there were no bank notes to sell, the result might not have fallen back. Tracing back to when our country adopted the white silver balance tax, the gold market has repeatedly had abnormal changes. Colleagues have lost their sense of direction, and only follow the lead of big players, blindly following suit. Because of this, rumors are easily generated, creating trouble. Observing the current situation, short sellers find it difficult to rest easy, but with banks emerging one after another, the future may change, making it extremely difficult to predict.

People's minds began to stabilize, and gradually retreated into the 900 yuan range. The bank did not stop selling, and major players sold notes one after another, gradually falling, but Sassoon took advantage of the low price to buy, and the bank slightly made up for it, once rising back to above 900 yuan. The bank took advantage of the high price to continue throwing, and the Hong Kong market hardened, allowing the supply side to be excited, and gradually going downstream, but the situation had stabilized, with many twists and turns in the middle, and the noon also presented a hovering situation, which was also due to the balance of supply from major players.

The Customs Gold Unit did not move, with no significant impact. After opening, because Chinese businessmen bought more vigorously, demand temporarily exceeded supply, and sellers watched.

It was learned in advance that HSBC's listing was flat in England and the US shrank by 1.25. Banks and Sassoon took advantage of the low price to buy, still rotating, but because the Bank of Japan and others still sold at a high price, it was difficult to tighten again.

Until the noon closing, the recent selling price was an English exchange rate of 1 shilling and 6.5 pence, and a US exchange rate of 37 yuan and 6.875. Compared with the previous closing, both England and the US were flat, but because the swap spread widened, the forward rate was tighter.

<h3 id="e186">Yarn Flower – Special Development in Yarn Sales <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Although the Italo-Abyssinian War has begun, the European situation seems relatively stable. The previously excited American cotton market has shown signs of softening. Government bonds, due to renewed rumors of inflation, had surged but experienced a decline again yesterday. Many participants in the yarn market have been profit-taking. However, actual yarn sales have seen special development. Merchants from Yunnan and Guangdong are actively purchasing 10-count coarse yarn, immediately enlivening the actual yarn market. As inventories dwindle, customer demand strengthens, indicating strong market confidence.</p>
<p>The opening of the forward yarn market after the Golden Rooster holiday was calm, with bullish investors adding to their positions. Although both the American and Indian cotton markets reported increases, the prices of No. 3 yarn flowers declined, thus offsetting the gains. Actual yarn sales are seeing special development, with strong demand from Yunnan and Guangdong merchants. Although many bullish investors are profit-taking on the surface, there are also many short-covering and new buyers. The market remains stable, with minimal fluctuations. Consequently, prices for various contract months saw a slight decrease of one to four cents compared to yesterday's closing. In the afternoon, due to bullish investors adding to their positions and a significant purchase by one firm, prices reversed from a decline to an increase. However, due to some selling by foreign firms at closing, prices closed with an increase of approximately seven cents to one dollar and seven cents for various contract months compared to yesterday's closing. Sales included: Tong Kee (1,700 bales), Da Feng (2,050 bales), Da Kee (1,500 bales), He Xing (1,400 bales), Ren Feng (1,400 bales), Chang Feng (4,700 bales), Xin Cheng Chang (750 bales), Yi Da (500 bales), Da Chang (450 bales), Tai Chang (450 bales), Tong He (400 bales), Tai Xing (600 bales), Sen Kang (750 bales), Yuan Yi (850 bales). Purchases included: Da Fu (1,650 bales), Yu Da (3,450 bales), Jin Chang (800 bales), Zhen Da (1,400 bales), Shen Chang (1,550 bales), Rui Da (850 bales), Shen Kee (1,100 bales), Run Kang (800 bales), Tong He (1,350 bales), Tai Chang (1,750 bales), Da Chang Cheng (1,150 bales), (whitespace) (1,150 bales), Tong Feng (550 bales), Chang Yu (550 bales).</p>
<p>Sales of over 1,600 bales of actual yarn have enlivened the market. Merchants from Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yunnan are actively purchasing, with 10-count yarn being the main commodity for Guangdong. The bulk of purchases by Sichuan merchants were 20-count yarn with less being 10-count. A total of 3,669 bales were traded, with prices increasing by one to two dollars. Purchase amounts from each are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e187">Despite Profit-Taking, Cotton Price Rally Resumes, One Major Player Continues Aggressive Buying, Export Business Active <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The continuous surge in cotton prices has led to significant profit-taking. However, yarn prices remain firm, and as soon as cotton prices decline, buyers emerge. Therefore, yesterday's cotton market saw a decline in the morning followed by a recovery in the afternoon, maintaining a stable trend. Nevertheless, with favorable weather conditions over the past two weeks, there are widespread expectations of increased yields in cotton-producing regions. The future of the cotton market will depend on the actual yields and consumption of the new cotton crop.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Declines in Morning, Recovers in Afternoon</p>
<p>The opening of the forward cotton market was weak, as American and Indian cotton prices increased, while No. 3 cotton opened nearly one dollar lower. Frequent profit-taking by bullish investors weakened the market further. Later, due to a large purchase by one firm, the market stabilized somewhat, with prices closing flat. As a result, prices for nearby contract months decreased by three to four cents compared to the previous day's closing, while distant contract months decreased by five to twenty-five cents. In the afternoon, aggressive buying by one firm encouraged many to increase their positions, resulting in strong buying interest and a sharp increase of forty to fifty cents in market prices. At closing, some selling due to high prices caused a slight pullback of ten to twenty cents. Ultimately, prices closed with gains or losses ranging from five to twenty-five cents compared to the previous day's closing. Sales included: Da Kee (2,000 dan), He Xing (2,200 dan), Chang Yu (1,700 dan), Shen Kee (3,900 dan), Ren Feng (1,500 dan), Yuan Yi (8,300 dan), Da Chang (1,500 dan), Tai Chang (1,400 dan), Run Kang (3,100 dan), Heng Chang (1,300 dan), Da Chang (1,700 dan), Sheng Yuan (2,500 dan), Yi Kang (2,500 dan), Yuan Xing Chang (3,000 dan), Rui Yuan (1,300 dan). Purchases included: Yu Quan (4,900 dan), Yuan Sheng (1,600 dan), Geng Feng (4,400 dan), Rui Da (10,100 dan), Sen Kang (1,000 dan), Tong He (2,100 dan), Xin Cheng Chang (1,500 dan), Xin Heng Hao (3,100 dan), Yi Yu (900 dan), Da Fu (900 dan), Yi Kang (900 dan), Fu Yuan (900 dan).</p>
<p>Active Trading in Actual Cotton</p>
<p>The actual cotton market is tight and firm, with relatively active export demand.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton saw an increase of seven to ten points due to favorable news from Liverpool and war-related news, with active trading by foreign firms in Liverpool, the Continent, Bombay, and the Far East. However, prices softened due to substantial short selling and profit-taking. Buying by dealers and brokers resumed, with strong current demand. Exporters are buying heavily. Southern yarn factories are absorbing the actual cotton textiles continuously transported from the mainland. The textile market is active and prices are firm. The weather remains favorable, but there are concerns about frost. Hester estimates factory use for this week at 262,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory is 134,000 bales. The market closed steady, with spot prices up five points and futures up four to eight points. English cotton spot prices increased by six points, and futures decreased by three to four points. Indian cotton rose due to short covering by short sellers, and buying by futures traders and speculators. Ping Gu Er rose three rupees, Olmra Pai rose 3.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose 4.25 rupees.

<h3 id="e189">Grain – No Intention to Ship Foodstuffs from This Port – Mistaken for a 100-Ton Transshipment of Raw Peanuts – Actual Shipment Only 400 Tons <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various Chinese and Western newspapers in this port widely reported that 100 tons of foodstuffs would be loaded onto an Italian ship bound for Italy. Yesterday, this newspaper believed there might be some truth to the rumor and proceeded to investigate further. The so-called 100 tons of foodstuffs turned out to be a mistaken report about 100 tons of raw peanuts being shipped from Qingdao to Shanghai for transshipment to Italy. Furthermore, it was discovered that the Italian ship "Kang Tie Fan Tian" scheduled to depart for Italy on the 9th will only be carrying around 400 tons of cargo from Shanghai. Besides the 100 tons of raw peanuts, there are also 95 tons of almonds being transshipped from Tianjin, 20 tons of miscellaneous goods being transshipped from Hankou, and over 200 tons of cargo being transshipped from Japan. There are no foodstuffs being shipped out from this port. (Editor's Note: Raw peanuts fall under the category of miscellaneous grains, which may have caused the confusion.)</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour and Wheat Markets – Inflation Rumors Again – Flour Market Confused, Large Fluctuations – Morning Opening Prices Plunge Due to Chicago and Liverpool Declines, Followed by Partial Recovery from Short Covering, Sharp Increase in Afternoon Due to Inflation Rumors – Fearful Market Reacts with Strong Buying – Upward Trend Continues <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is chaotic with high volatility. At the opening this morning, prices plunged due to declines in Chicago (10-20 cents) and Canada (14 cents) as well as Liverpool (2 pence). Market sentiment was uneasy, and prices immediately dropped by a significant 3-4 points. Short covering led to a recovery of around one point. In the afternoon, prices surged due to widespread rumors that inflation was imminent. The serious situation caused by the East African crisis had barely passed when new rumors arose, causing fear. As a result, buyers returned strongly, and the market steadily increased, recovering 5-6 points from the morning's low and rising 1-2 points from the previous day's closing. Future developments are uncertain and difficult to predict based on facts.</p>
<p>Wheat prices saw declines, but the market has not yet capitalized on the East African war. However, falling foreign wheat prices caused increasing anxiety among speculators. This month's opening price was only 20 cents, a fall of 5 points. Distant contract months also dropped by 5-6 points. In the afternoon, the market initially remained calm but then surged as gold prices increased and rumors of currency reform spread. The Japanese flour market also recovered. Consequently, the market steadily rallied after the second trading session, rising by as much as 8-9 points from the morning's low. If the inflation rumors materialize, prices will likely undergo significant changes. The current wheat market remains firm, with Shandong wheat opening at $4.20, Shaheguan wheat at $4.19, Jiangbei wheat at $4.16, and Nanjing wheat at $4.109. A total of 5,000 bags were reportedly handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Native Rice – Prices soared yesterday due to strong demand from local merchants and limited supply. Demand from rural囤积 (túndī - hoarding) households was also strong. Newly arrived Jiangxi, Anhui, and Beijing rice were actively traded. Yongjiang and Jianghu white rice surged by 2 cents, while other types of rice increased by 1 cent, with continued optimistic sentiment. Daily trading volume included 1,000 bags of Yong rice, over 900 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,400 bags of Beijing rice, and over 300 bags of Anqing, Nanling, and other Anhui rice, all handled by local merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice – No new orders have been placed recently. Inventories are dwindling, and sellers are uniformly raising prices. Local merchants and hoarders showed little interest. Daily trading volume included 1,500 bags of Saigon rice and 700 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, with prices increasing by 5 cents to nearly 1 cent. In the afternoon, Tianjin merchants searched for Siamese machine-milled rice. Due to sellers holding firm, only over 300 bags were traded at a price of $11.50, a jump of 9 cents from the previously sold "Chong Er Hao" at $10.06.</p>
<p>South Shanghai – A total of 35-36 shipments arrived from various sources yesterday (totaling over 7,000 shi). Sales in the local market were sluggish, with a continued flow of over 1,000 bags being disposed of by Yantai and Qingdao merchants. Prices for loose sales were tight. As a result, prices for thinner quality rice rose by 2 cents, while loose sales were flat. Thicker quality rice was only traded locally without any gains or losses. New Japonica rice varieties, such as Bai Ge Zhong, were similarly priced. New Du Geng and other fine varieties saw balanced supply and demand, maintaining a stable trend. Aged rice varieties showed little difference from the original price.</p>
<p>North Shanghai – Yesterday, 37-38 shipments arrived from various sources downstream. Sales of various types of rice in the market were active, and merchant demand was good due to the cloudy weather. Bai Po rice increased by several cents to 1 cent. Dong Xin rice saw an immediate increase, and Nan Xin rice seemed to increase by around 2 cents. Bai Yuan rice tightened by 1-2 cents. New Mei Du Jian and other fine rice varieties closely followed by around 1 cent. Ke Jian rice followed closely, with Jiaozhong rice adding a cent. The market for thinner quality rice was stable. Other varieties also showed a tightening trend.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Revelry and Bizarre Costumes <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Like Hong</p>
<p>Recent newspaper reports said, "This year's Double Tenth Festival, Guangdong has organized revelry." And "During the Double Tenth Festival, the ban on bizarre costumes will be lifted..." This seems quite novel this year.</p>
<p>However, I feel that this "novelty" is abnormal. In these times of national turmoil and escalating global crises, not only the poor Chinese people have no reason to rejoice, but even the so-called powerful capitalist countries and other small nations are suffering intensely.</p>
<p>The word "revelry" ("歡") has "madness" ("狂") above it. "Madness" is an adjective describing abnormality. Trying to "rejoice" without "joy" is like a dying person saying, "I want to live" at the moment of death. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is "revelry" just before the Second World War.</p>
<p>With revelry, the "ban on bizarre costumes" will naturally be lifted. Otherwise, if the young ladies wear plain clothes, unable to expose their jade arms or bare their breasts, the revelry will be less interesting!</p>
<p>However, only a few can participate in revelry and wear bizarre costumes. The vast majority of women, unable to attend to such things, not only do not revel, not only do not wear bizarre costumes, but barely have time to mend old clothes, even frowning.</p>
<p>So, let those who want to revel, revel. Let those who want to wear bizarre costumes, wear them. Anyway, these are just the last excitements.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Her Way Out <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>This magazine's previous issue carried Mr. Tie Huai's article "Where is Her Way Out," which recounted the dispute involving Mr. Jia, a "journalist turned middle school teacher" in Hangzhou, who seduced three women, A, B, and C. Now, Ms. B has been abandoned, leading to "no way out." This phenomenon is increasingly common in today's society. It is no longer just "an abnormal phenomenon in an abnormal society" but has become a widespread and serious problem in today's society. Examples include the sensational "Teng Bian Love Killing Case" in Beiping not long ago and the scandalous affair involving a certain inspector of the Shandong Education Bureau. Although the circumstances may not be identical, the underlying causes are similar. Therefore, we need to analyze and criticize these facts in detail.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the protagonist who created this situation is Mr. Jia. He took advantage of his position as a middle school teacher, "and taught female students. He used this to get to know many young women whose affections were just beginning to blossom. Because he was good at chatting and joking during class, he gained the favor of several young ladies." He repeatedly seduced women. First, he placed a "flower-like beauty" Ms. Nei—an unofficial Mrs. Jia, in his home to serve as his reproductive machine. Later, he used sweet words to flatter Ms. B repeatedly. When Ms. B was heavily pregnant, she discovered Jia's relationship with Ms. D. This kind of man, using his superior social position, repeatedly tramples on the weak woman whose affections were just blossoming" under the mask of "love," is already shocking. What's more, Mr. Jia is a "middle school teacher." Instead of taking responsibility for guiding students, he used this opportunity to carry out his seduction. This not only destroys women, but also destroys female education, giving opponents of female education more excuses, which is what makes us gnash our teeth in hatred the most.</p>
<p>As for the three women, A, B, and C, who were trampled on, Mr. Tie Huai did not reveal the situation of the latter two in detail, so we can only focus on the facts of Ms. B. Ms. B is an orphan who lost her parents early and has no siblings. Her only uncle, due to disputes over inheritance, damaged family affection and lost her support. In this vast and bleak situation, Mr. Jia first helped her fight for the inheritance, then repeatedly provided assistance, accompanied her to the hospital when she was sick, and left her at home to recuperate after her illness, and introduced her to a job. In this way, a young girl who had not experienced much of the world and was "friendless" and "suffering from illness" was naturally easily deceived by Mr. Jia's cunning plot. So we say that Ms. B's seduction was indeed understandable.</p>
<p>However, when Ms. B was moved to tears and surrendered her body, she at least neglected the following two points: First, Ms. B already knew that Ms. C had been living with Mr. Jia for many years and already had children. At this time, she should have first investigated the relationship between Jia and C. If Jia and C still had love for each other until then, then Ms. B should definitely not sacrifice Ms. Nei for her own desires. If there was no longer any love between Jia and C, then they should cohabitate after Jia and C's relationship was settled. Second, since Ms. B discovered Jia and D's relationship when she was heavily pregnant, Mr. Jia's attitude was already clearly visible. At this time, Ms. B should no longer have waited and seen, but should have cleared up her relationship quickly. But Ms. B was still dreaming of "resolving the Ms. D incident so that the child in her womb would have a legitimate father." Therefore, Mr. Jia's departure seemed so unexpected. Due to these two points of improper handling, Ms. B cannot completely shirk responsibility for her current "no way out."</p>
<p>However, here we should recognize clearly that although the occurrence of the facts is due to the four of them, the reason why this fact is allowed to happen has to be traced back to its social origins. In this male-centered society, men occupy all the advantages, so Mr. Jia can repeatedly seduce women and still remain at large. On Ms. B's side, her being seduced is first and foremost because she cannot be economically independent, and society does not provide any protection, so she has to rely on marriage as a profession and the only way to guarantee her life. Also, after she was abandoned, instead of realistically seeking a way out in society, she just sighed, "Will anyone be willing to marry me?" This also shows her fundamental attitude of "love is life, love is everything."</p>
<p>Therefore, to fundamentally eliminate these multi-party love disputes and enable both men and women to develop on normal paths, only after the fundamental reform of this male-centered society and the complete elimination of the obstacles to women's liberation, circling around the individual alone cannot achieve a thorough solution. However, it must be said again that before the thorough reform of the social system is realized, we cannot ask Ms. B to wait day after day. We must find a more reasonable way out within the possible range. According to Ms. B's current situation, on the negative side, we should first try to settle her relationship with Mr. Jia. It is better to treat him as an enemy and thoroughly settle it, and do not harbor any illusions and follow the wrong path of the past. On the positive side, it is to strive for an independent position in society. First of all, we should seek considerable independence in economic terms. In today's society, finding a job in general is very difficult, but Ms. B must never be disheartened because she is a "junior high school graduate." In Chinese society, it is truly rare for a woman to receive junior high school education. Even if she "has no connections" and cannot find a suitable job, doing street vending or hard labor is better than living a parasitic life of prostitution. What Ms. B is particularly reluctant to give up is "remarrying." This way out is just repeating the mistakes of the past. If Ms. B continues to use marriage as a profession or make love the center of her life, then no one can guarantee that she will not be deceived again. Therefore, "love" turning into "marriage" should be taken as a side issue here, and she should put most of her energy into social undertakings, especially awakening other young women who are still dreaming, in order to reform this unreasonable social system for the sake of relieving the shackles of oneself and all oppressed compatriots. If Ms. B can resolutely move forward in this direction, then although she will have to go through many hardships, I dare to say that Ms. B's future is still bright. And one day, she will despise this shameful and false "gentle dream" and receive greater comfort among the vast sisterhood!</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>(Eight)</p>
<p>The night's panic frightened Mrs. Zhonggui into illness. Although young master Zhonggui was not sick, his cheeks were noticeably thinner. Relatives from nearby villages and clansmen, including the village head, came to offer condolences and visit.</p>
<p>"Old lady, you must drink some honeysuckle soup. Here is a package of ginseng. Have the maid boil it for you. Otherwise, I think it's better to send them (ghosts) away." The female relative said in a low voice.</p>
<p>The male guests were all in the living room. The village head clasped his hands and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations! Brother Zhonggui! At least nothing was moved. As for the old lady's fright, a doctor will be called to take a look and she will be fine soon."</p>
<p>"Thank you! Thank! You! It is good that everyone is here. I originally wanted to ask everyone to discuss it."</p>
<p>Young master Zhonggui wanted to discuss two things: One was that when the fire first started last night, a robber took advantage of the situation to escape down the mountain and was caught by the militia. He is now tied up under the camphor tree, and it is not known how to deal with him. The other was that the fire last night destroyed seven or eight houses, creating a crowd of refugees, and it is not known how to deal with them in the best way.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the robber, everyone said in unison that he must be tortured to avoid future troubles. As for the refugees, that was a bit difficult, and everyone pondered. After eating ten plates of "pot" pastries, and also drinking a lot of ham soup, they still couldn't find a good solution.</p>
<p>"This matter can be discussed slowly. It is not good to have many refugees in the village. In short, find a way to maintain order in the area and prevent any disasters." Everyone said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>The ice in the river had turned into chunks, and the ice floes were covered with burnt ashes. The bank was a burnt field. Although the fire had been extinguished, green smoke still permeated the sky. Blackened beams and pillars were lying horizontally or hanging down, and tiles and broken bricks decorated the ruins. Someone discovered that a person had been burned to death and dug out from the pile of tiles and bricks. There were no clothes or hair, just a pitch-black segment.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Mother asked. "That must be Aunt Youfu, alas, burned to death like this." She clasped her hands and bowed to the charred body several times. Shedding tears, she said to Lifu's wife, "We've been good friends for so many years. I didn't think she would die like this... I knew something was wrong. There was a 'bang' sound. The bodhisattva foretold me. Look at this, how can we not worship the bodhisattva!"</p>
<p>"What bodhisattva, no bodhisattva. I won't. If he is spiritual, why didn't he protect us from being burned?"</p>
<p>"Mother! Don't say that. Now that we've gotten to this point, we're all relying on the bodhisattva to protect us. God, don't blame her for not understanding!" Just as the sister-in-law was about to retort, a person was seen hanging from the elm tree. The little nun came to report that they were going to beat the robber. She dragged Xiuzhen to see. The robber's two big toes were tied tightly with two hemp ropes. His feet were not touching the ground, and two stones were hung on them. His whole body was straight as a line, moving in the air. Young master Zhonggui's attendants, awakened by the liquor, bared their chests and beat him with a tree branch with all their might. After hitting a few times, they asked:</p>
<p>"Tell me, who is your leader?"</p>
<p>The robber did not say anything. After being tortured again, they asked:</p>
<p>"Tell me quickly, who is your leader?"</p>
<p>The robber still did not say anything. At first, he screamed and yelled, but later gradually turned into a "mhm mhm" humming.</p>
<p>Young master Zhonggui gave the order, saying that he had to be made to speak, and that they would not stop beating him if he did not speak. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Legal Advice <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>(Question) I am cohabitating with Mr. A, but we have not held a wedding ceremony. However, Mr. A is already married to Ms. B, and we obtained Ms. B's consent before moving in together. We lived harmoniously for half a month, but now Ms. B's family has suddenly become opposed to it and is inciting others to threaten me. I would be grateful if you could answer the following questions.</p>
<p>(1) Does Ms. B's family have the right to interfere with our cohabitation? Is our cohabitation legal?</p>
<p>(2) Can Mr. A be charged with bigamy or any other crime?</p>
<p>(3) If Ms. B does not file a lawsuit, can others file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>(4) If Mr. A abandons me, can I obtain reasonable living expenses? -Yi Ying</p>
<p>(Answer)</p>
<p>(1) No.</p>
<p>(2) Since no wedding ceremony was held, the crime of bigamy is not established. However, if the cohabitation continues after the implementation of the new criminal law on July 1st, Mr. A will be in violation of Article 239 regarding interference with marriage, and the woman is equally culpable.</p>
<p>(3) No. The crime under Article 239 requires prosecution upon complaint. Ms. B, having condoned it beforehand, cannot bring charges, but her consent must be reliably proven.</p>
<p>(4) If the woman's union with Mr. A is not merely an ambiguous cohabitation relationship but implies permanent cohabitation as a member of the family (i.e., obtaining the status of a concubine), then if Mr. A abandons the woman without cause, causing her to fall into financial hardship, she may request reasonable alimony.</p>
<p>(Question)</p>
<p>(1) If a husband and wife are estranged, and the husband has been away for several years and does not return, making the wife a de facto widow, can she file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>(2) If an aunt raises a niece from childhood until she is about to marry, but then sends her home and disregards her completely, as if severing the relationship, can the niece file a lawsuit to divide the adoptive mother's property? (If the adoptive mother does not acknowledge the adoptive daughter, what can be done?) Or are there other solutions?</p>
<p>(3) If an aunt raises a ten-year-old niece (who is fatherless) for one or two years, can she freely give her away? If a girl in her teens is adopted, can procedures be put in place to prevent her future abandonment? If she is taken in as an adopted daughter, but in the future, she is intended to be the son's wife, can this be implemented? How can it be prevented? -You Zhen</p>
<p>(Answer)</p>
<p>(1) She can request cohabitation.</p>
<p>(2) An adoptive relationship can be terminated by mutual consent at any time. If the adoptive mother has engaged in malicious abandonment as stipulated in Article 1081, Section 2 of the Civil Code, the adoptive daughter may sue for termination of the adoptive relationship, and if she is faultless and falls into financial hardship, she may request the payment of appropriate support. Whether she is actually an adoptive daughter must be proven by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>(3) The adoption of children should be done in writing, except in cases where the child has been raised as one's own from a young age. Furthermore, betrothal and marriage should be based on the free will of the man and woman involved; others should not force them. If a marriage contract is arranged by parents on behalf of their children when they are young, and the daughter does not wish to ratify it after she comes of age, she can sue for a declaration of invalidity.

<p>Women's Issues Forum</p>
<h3 id="e197">Section 4: Occupational Issues <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The occupational issue for women is similar to the issues of political participation and education: it concerns women gaining equal rights with men in the workplace. The content of this issue includes demands for equal pay for equal work, protection of motherhood, the opening of all occupational sectors, and the abolition of all gender-based discrimination in employment. Many people in our country who care about women's issues have engaged in heated discussions on this topic. However, the general understanding of the essence of this issue is still insufficient. Especially after the recent outbreak of the global economic panic, this issue has not only failed to be further resolved but has instead given rise to various disputes. Therefore, I feel it is still necessary to raise this issue for discussion.</p>
<p>The occupational issue for women is also an inevitable product of the growth process of capitalist society. After capitalism broke down the feudal system, it reorganized all social matters according to its own needs, making them suitable for its development. A train speeding across the mountains and an airplane flying through the sky are certainly suitable for the growth of capitalism, and a politician tirelessly campaigning and a farmer toiling in the fields are also suitable for the development of capitalism. Similarly, a female office worker busy typing in an office or a female shop assistant busy serving customers in a department store is also suitable for the existence and development of capitalism. In other words, everything in capitalist society is very suitably arranged and organized to increase the profits of capitalists. The so-called female worker has also emerged to meet this need.</p>
<p>The so-called working woman, in a broad sense, refers to all women who sell their mental or physical labor in exchange for a livelihood, including female laborers. In a narrow sense, it refers to female employees or business owners with some administrative or technical abilities who have independent status. The term "working woman" usually refers to the latter, and therefore, this discussion will focus on the latter.</p>
<p>The specific reasons for the emergence of working women can be observed from two aspects. On the one hand, the capitalist mode of production requires not only large-scale economic production organizations but also huge consumption and distribution mechanisms. In order to increase their profits, the bourgeoisie wants to operate this huge social mechanism in the most agile and economical way. Therefore, female technicians who are agile, hard-working, and require very cheap labor conditions have become their target of need. On the other hand, the capitalist mode of production has gradually destroyed the old family economy and family system, while turning all members of society into two types of people: those who live off profits and those who live off wages. Most men who rely solely on wages are unable to support their wives or daughters, and their wives or daughters must also become wage earners who sell their physical or mental labor. Due to these two fundamental reasons, the number of working women has been increasing day by day, and the issue of working women has become a major social problem, even becoming a central issue in the women's liberation movement.</p>
<p>In Europe and the United States, this issue has been a matter of general concern since the early 19th century. During the rise of capitalism, although women had to seek employment in society, society also needed female workers. However, women faced many difficult struggles to enter the workplace. Male-dominated society was relatively lenient in opening up the lowest levels of physical labor to women, but it was unwilling to easily open up the higher levels of mental labor. That is to say, male-dominated society viewed it as normal for a woman to be a factory worker, as if women could only do that kind of low-level work. But if she wanted to be a female doctor or a female teacher, many arguments would be raised, saying that women having careers would be a factor in destroying families, a root cause of disrupting social order, and that women were inherently inferior and could not handle important social matters, and so on. Recently, there has been a similar phenomenon in our country, that is, in order to exclude working women, they are given the most demeaning name of "flower vases," especially in the Guangzhou male-female occupational dispute, where the male side raised the issue of social order to exclude women. Despite this, the historical mission of capitalism is bound to open up the future of women's careers. According to recent estimates, there are about 100 million working women in the world, and the United States alone already has 10 million, of which at least 10% are so-called working women in the narrow sense. According to the "Japan Labor Yearbook of Taisho 10," the total number of working women in Japan (there were 3.56 million female workers) was 865,078. Among them, 218,958 were engaged in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, education, and government offices, 605,793 were engaged in the commercial sector, 10,727 were engaged in the industrial sector, and 29,600 were engaged in other occupations. These are the figures from more than ten years ago, and the current number is certainly higher. Although there are no verifiable figures for working women in our country, it can be asserted that their numbers are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>In the midst of this increasing number of working women, capitalist society experienced internal flaws. Since 1929, an irreparable global economic panic broke out. In order to save themselves from the chaos of the panic, the bourgeoisies of various countries implemented fascist policies of domination, and these policies immediately affected the issue of women's employment. That is to say, in order to alleviate the panic of unemployment, countries were forcing women to return from the workplace to the home and replacing them with unemployed men, and thus working women suffered an unprecedented blow. Recently, some people in our country have also advocated that women's natural duty is to be wives and mothers and have rejected women's employment. This is also the same attempt by the general ruling class to oppress women in the total collapse of the entire capitalist economy! However, we must know that this is their last attempt, a temporary blow. History is bound to open up the future for working women and is bound to solve the issue of women's employment.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Gonorrheal Prostatitis <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>After contracting gonorrhea, the gonorrheal diplococcus can invade various parts of the body as acute gonorrhea transitions through subacute gonorrhea to become chronic gonorrhea, often causing complications. When it invades the prostate gland, it causes prostatitis.</p>
<p>The prostate gland is located on both sides of the posterior urethra, between the pubic symphysis and the rectum, and secretes a fluid called prostatic fluid. Its function is to aid the movement of sperm, and it is extremely important for reproductive function. When the gonorrheal diplococcus invades the prostate gland from the posterior urethra, it causes gonorrheal prostatitis as a complication of gonorrhea. Its symptoms can be divided into acute and chronic types.</p>
<p>Acute gonorrheal prostatitis is characterized by severe pain during urination, frequent urination, and even a constant urge to urinate. There is a feeling of pressure in the anus and perineum. Bowel movements cause severe pain in the anus. In severe cases, fever, loss of appetite, and overall pain are experienced. After this period, it gradually becomes chronic gonorrheal prostatitis. At this time, the patient experiences a moderate degree of frequent urination, painful urination, and unusual sensations in the perineum and rectum, often leading to defecation. After suffering from gonorrheal prostatitis, whether acute or chronic, there is a special phenomenon: a milky, turbid secretion often flows from the urethral opening during bowel movements or urination. This is called prostatic leakage. Since prostatic fluid secreted by the prostate gland can aid the movement of sperm, once prostatitis occurs, it will naturally hinder sperm movement. Gonorrheal prostatitis often leads to the inability to have sexual intercourse. Therefore, gonorrheal prostatitis has a very large impact on fertility. If it is not treated promptly and properly, there is a risk of infertility. Treatment should be sought quickly, and the primary goal is to kill the gonococci. At the same time, oral medications should be taken to kill the bacteria. For external medication, Gonorrhea Soother Ear is sure to have great efficacy. In addition, shortwave diathermy is particularly effective, quickly. With shortwave diathermy, the heat can penetrate deeply into the prostate gland and kill the gonococci with heat. (Editor's note: Chunzai Hospital, located at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, has the latest electrical equipment available at very low prices. The shortwave diathermy treats gonorrhea and all its complications and can achieve results in a short period of time. "Germicide for Gonorrhea and Gonorrhea Soother Ear" are both sold at Ren Shou Western Drugstore, 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession of this city.)</p>
<h3 id="e199">Discussion of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neurasthenia <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>The patient's function is reduced, and a state of increased excitability develops, leading to fatigue, lack of ability, headache, dizziness, insomnia, palpitations, indigestion, back and limb pain, abnormal sensation, and vasomotor disturbances. Complications include hypochondria, depression, and hysterial symptoms. Severe cases can lead to obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and phobias. Many neurasthenia patients have severe suffering but still appear healthy. There are also frequent tremors of the hands, increased heart activity, frequent eyelid opening and closing, flickering eyes, moderate pupillary dilation, and active tendon reflexes. Severe kidney disease and diabetes also have similar symptoms and should be considered. For the treatment of neurasthenia, adequate sleep is essential. Food should be simple and non-stimulating. Limit the consumption of meat, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages. Those with functional heart nerve disorders should abstain from tobacco. Those with poor business should have highly nutritious food. Iron supplements (San-atogen Tropon), malt extract, Promonta, milk therapy, or Weir Mitchell's obesity cure can be used. Patients who lead normal lives should engage in regular exercise, such as walking, park work, indoor exercise, massage, partial baths, full baths, pine needle baths, and salt mineral baths. Phosphorous injections, oral potassium bromide, and An Er Shen pills can be used for symptomatic treatment.

<h3 id="e200">Germicide is a Wonderful Medicine for Treating Ringworm and Scabies <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Ringworm and scabies are both types of skin diseases in humans. There are many patients in today's society. However, because there are few effective agents that are truly beneficial and harmless, it is often thought to be a difficult disease to cure. In fact, ringworm and scabies are caused by a type of ringworm and scabies mite that invades human skin. This mite is highly contagious. The main symptoms are small rashes, blisters, or nodules on the skin, which are extremely itchy. The itching is worse with warmth. After scratching, severe papules and pustules often develop. Ringworm and scabies are particularly common on the sides of the fingers, the joints of the fingers, the flexor surface of the wrist joint, the extensor surface of the elbow joint, the breasts, the penis, the groin, the waist, the scrotum, the buttocks, and the ventral side of the foot. However, regardless of the type of ringworm and scabies, and regardless of the location, the source is always the transmission of this mite, which invades the skin. Therefore, the most important method of treatment is to kill the mites. Drugs for treating ringworm and scabies are also best if they have insecticidal power. However, because ringworm and scabies often attach to human skin, the ringworm and scabies medicine must not only have a strong insecticidal effect but also not damage the skin, not damage the internal organs due to the skin absorbing the drug to kill the mites, and be clean in color and peaceful in odor. It is also an extremely important requirement to not damage clothing and bedding. Among the current Chinese and Western medicines for treating ringworm and scabies, the Germicide produced by Ren Shou Western Drugstore has a very strong insecticidal power and no side effects. Those who suffer from skin diseases such as ringworm and scabies, using Germicide, without exception, the medicine works and the disease is eradicated immediately and never recurs. Therefore, Germicide has become a wonderful medicine for skin diseases such as ringworm and scabies. In addition, mercury quartz lamps and artificial sun lamps can also cure ringworm and scabies. The reason is also that the mites are killed by the heat. The artificial sun lamp and mercury quartz lamp available at Chunzai Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession are among the newest types. The effect of treating ringworm and scabies is greatly accelerated.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Excessive Stomach Acid and Stomach Pain <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Xuan</p>
<p>The human stomach is the main organ for digesting food. The stomach constantly secretes a digestive gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and enzymes. Food enters the stomach through saliva and chewing in the mouth and mixes with gastric juice, causing a fermentation reaction that digests the food. The hydrochloric acid contained in gastric juice has the function of preventing spoilage and killing bacteria. If bacteria are mixed into the stomach due to food, the bacteria's living function can be killed by the action of hydrochloric acid. It also works together with pepsin to convert proteins in food into easily absorbed nutrients, nourishing various parts of the human body. Therefore, gastric acid is extremely important for the body. However, there is a certain amount of acid in the stomach. Both too much and too little can cause disease, especially too much. With excessive stomach acid, the stomach immediately feels pain. The pain is especially severe when the stomach is empty. A burning sensation occurs in the stomach, with symptoms such as acid regurgitation, heartburn, and belching. Because there is too much stomach acid, food is easily digested, so the appetite is particularly good, and the stomach is often hungry. Meat is the easiest to digest, followed by starches. Because stomach acid is very irritating, the gastric mucosa is damaged by excessive irritation from stomach acid, resulting in gastric ulcer disease, which leads to stomach pain. Therefore, those who suffer from hyperacidity often develop stomach ulcers and stomach pain. The most obvious symptom is severe pain in the stomach after eating, often lasting for one or two hours until vomiting occurs. The pain feels burning or spastic. There are often symptoms of heartburn, nausea, belching, and acid regurgitation. Gradually, the stomach bleeds due to the ulcer damaging the blood vessels in the stomach, leading to vomiting of blood and bloody stools. Eventually, gastritis or perforating peritonitis develops, endangering life.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that excessive stomach acid is most likely to cause stomach ulcers and stomach pain and will endanger life. It must not be ignored. The most appropriate treatment is to neutralize stomach acid. The stomach treasure produced by Ren Shou Western Drugstore on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession of Shanghai is an effective remedy for stomach diseases. It has a miraculous effect on neutralizing excessive stomach acid, stopping all stomach pain, and treating all stomach diseases. It is truly a blessing for those with stomach ailments.</p>

<h3 id="e204">The Effect of Opium on the Brain and Spinal Cord <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. She Lei</p>
<p>The effect of opium on the brain is similar in all vertebrates, but the degree of brain development varies, so the symptoms presented are also different.</p>
<p>According to animal experiments, when morphine is given to frogs, the function of the cerebrum disappears first, followed by the midbrain, then the cerebellum, and finally the function of the medulla oblongata disappears in succession. In higher animals, including humans, when morphine or opium is taken to a considerable tolerance level, the sensitivity of the cerebral cortex to strong sensory stimuli is dulled first. Therefore, it can reduce or even forget feelings of pain, fatigue, hunger, and suffering. The sensitivity of the respiratory center to stimuli is also reduced, so it can make coughing disappear. Consciousness is not reduced, so sleep does not occur. But later, these parts are also gradually affected, and the sensitivity to external stimuli gradually becomes dull and sleep occurs. At this time, all unpleasant feelings are forgotten, and the mind is in a trance, as if traveling in a dreamland. It feels a kind of indescribable pleasure. Those who abuse morphine or opium as an addiction probably have this effect, which is one of the reasons why people become addicted.</p>
<p>Any part of the brain is excited by opium or morphine. Sometimes irregular concepts arise, and the mental state changes rapidly, presenting a state of exaltation. It was previously thought that this was the excitatory effect of morphine or opium, but it is not actually excitation. This is because the various functions of the brain lose their balance, the conceptual realm has not been affected, and the sensitivity of sensation has decreased. External stimuli have very little influence, so only the conceptual realm dominates and irregular concepts arise, presenting a kind of excitatory state. Therefore, this situation is actually the early stage of anesthesia.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Small Newspaper Year <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>In the past few years, the small newspapers in Shanghai, and even the supplements of various major newspapers, could almost be said to be dressed in the colorful clothes of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School. The anecdotes of Rogue Scholars, the tales of courtesans, the photos of famous actors and actresses, as well as essays and serial novels about women, were their main content. Readers could be found on trams, in shops, in amusement parks, and in teahouses. However, as the times trended "new," the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School gradually lost ground. First, the supplements of some major newspapers changed direction, and new literary works, miscellaneous essays, and notes replaced the masterpieces of the Shanghai School of writers and novelists. Recently, there have been even greater changes in the small newspaper world. The appearance of several newly published small newspapers is completely different from that of the original small newspapers. Their content includes current affairs commentary, academic lectures, science essays, social commentary, life sketches, news from various places, etc., almost like new small magazines. The so-called magazine-style small newspaper can truly be said to be their characteristic. At the same time, it is said that even among the most famous of the existing small newspapers, the number of copies sold is gradually decreasing, while the sales of several newly published small newspapers that have appeared with a new look are not bad. It is really hard to say whether this development will cause those old small newspapers to change direction. Thus, some people who are aware of the times say, "This year is the year of the small newspaper!" Indeed, it can be said that this year is the "year of the small newspaper," but what is the significance of this "year of the small newspaper"? How did it come about? People have not yet correctly answered this question.</p>
<p>A certain writer said that the progression from "something year" to "magazine year" and then from "magazine year" to "small newspaper year" indicates that China is regressing from "big" to "small," and that the Chinese people are good at "avoiding difficulties and taking the easy way," engaging in speculation and opportunism. From this, he concluded that "the Chinese nation has no hope." But I say this is a kind of formalism! Our solution to problems cannot be based solely on the form of the problem. Recently, a large number of ancient books have been printed by some bookstores, such as the Twenty-Six Histories, various "wenku" (collections of ancient Chinese books), and rare editions. Their form is very large, but we cannot say that they have the meaning of progress just because they are "big." Similarly, we cannot say that small newspapers appearing in a new form are a sign of regression just because they are "small." The evaluation should mainly come from their content. In fact, the newly published so-called magazine-style small newspapers are naturally not as "big" as those large magazines in terms of form, but judging from their content, they are at least much more advanced than those small newspapers that used to be dressed in the colorful clothes of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School. Therefore, we believe that the appearance of the "year of the small newspaper" is not a symbol of China's regression, and even less can it be said that "the Chinese nation has no hope." Rather, it has a certain progressive significance.</p>
<p>As for the reason for the appearance of the "year of the small newspaper," it is certainly not due to the "speculation and opportunism" of those who founded the new small newspapers, but rather has its social basis. Here, we can put forward several points:</p>
<p>First, we believe that although Chinese culture is generally relatively backward, the speed of ideological progress in China in recent years has been very fast. From the May Fourth Movement through the May Thirtieth Movement to the present, although it has only been a little over ten years, the ideological progress of China has almost gone through the centuries that Western Europe has gone through in the past. This is an undeniable historical fact. Under such ideological progress, publications that talk about women and promote low-level interests have been abandoned by most people who live seriously. Humorous articles that once made some people feel happy have also become overly pedantic. What is now popular is popular academic writing and science essays. The so-called "year of the small newspaper" has emerged under this influence.</p>
<p>Secondly, the readers of small newspapers are mainly small and medium-sized merchants, shop assistants, apprentices, some workers, and unemployed and out-of-school youth. In this era of economic panic and depressing life, along with the progress of social thought, the desire to seek knowledge</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The desire to seek knowledge is also growing day by day. Even if they spend two or three copper coins to buy a small newspaper, they have to think about it. Among many small newspapers, they must buy the one that can give them the most useful knowledge. Those things that talk about low-level interests are certainly not what they need at present. Therefore, some people have seized the opportunity to start some new small newspapers, and that is how the "year of the small newspaper" came about.</p>
<p>Finally, the so-called economic downturn is also fundamentally related to the appearance of the "year of the small newspaper." Because of the downturn in industry and commerce and the reduction in general purchasing power, even to start a small business requires a lot of capital. As for large social undertakings, they require even more substantial capital to carry out. This is also the case in the cultural world. If you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars to start a large newspaper or a large bookstore or even a large magazine, it is unlikely that you will be able to run it well and maintain it for a long time. On the other hand, if you use the money for running a large newspaper to run a small newspaper, or use the money for running a bookstore or a large magazine to run a small weekly, as long as you can recognize the needs of the readers and manage it well, you will have a good future. The current era is an era of using big money to run small businesses. Therefore, some smart people have raised relatively large amounts of capital to run small newspapers. In fact, don't the several new small newspapers that have recently appeared have capital of 100,000 to 80,000 yuan?</p>
<p>The advancement of social thought, the general readers' rejection of low-level interests, and the demand for useful and progressive knowledge: these are the objective requirements for the emergence of new small newspapers. The economic downturn in industry and commerce, and the reliability of only using big money to run small businesses: these are the economic conditions for the emergence of new small newspapers. The general reason for the emergence of the "year of the small newspaper" lies here.</p>
<p>As for the quality of the several small newspapers that have recently appeared in a new form, we do not want to make arbitrary judgments here. We only say that they must have content and form that are suitable for the needs of the general readers in order to have a great future. If a new small newspaper can use high-quality paper and a very scientific printing technique to print very substantial content, and sell it at a very low price, then I dare say that it will be warmly welcomed and supported by everyone and will develop rapidly. On the other hand, if it only boasts in advertisements, only improves the form of the newspaper, and only uses a few unqualified "celebrities" to appeal, while the content is full of outdated ideas and even still promotes low-level interests, then I dare say that it will be increasingly despised and will move towards its own death. The current era is different. Even the readers of small newspapers want to see good goods. Advertisements and "celebrities" can only play a role under good goods!</p>
<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3 id="e206">King of Football, Li Huitang <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Prisoner of the Past</p>
<p>Li Huitang lives in a very luxurious apartment along Xizhe Road. It is a nine-story giant building, shooting straight into the sky like a pen tube. Outside the gate is a circular lawn, which looks a bit like a spittoon next to such a giant building. I walked along the car lane on the edge of the lawn for about several tens of steps and arrived at a vast and magnificent living room. After taking the name card in, a young man with a long figure wearing a blue-gray suit came out of the elevator, greeted me to sit down, and after a few "idle words" between each other, we "got down to business."</p>
<p>"If it weren't for representing Hong Kong this time, Mr. Li probably wouldn't have come to Shanghai, right?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare say that I'm representing, but this time it's a rare opportunity to visit friends I haven't seen for many years, and also to take this opportunity to reunite with football fans in Shanghai."</p>
<p>"After going to Hong Kong, are you still as interested in football as you were in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Of course. A person who has a special love for something is unwilling to give up that love from beginning to end, let alone that I have been 'inseparable' from football since I was a child!"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's why you deserve to be called the 'Football Freak'!" I said, looking at him with a smile. "So, you've been playing football since you were a child until now. I believe you must have a lot of insights that ordinary football players can't comprehend, right?"</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true." He quickly took my words and said, "Playing football is just like doing any other career. You have to 'persevere' to make progress, because this kind of thing can't be learned to the point of perfection in a day or two. I dare not exaggerate how good my football skills are, but it is true that I have suffered for it for many years. I remember when I was studying in elementary school, I was only that tall, but I loved football so much that I didn't even want to eat sometimes, and I would compete with others at every turn, wishing I could sleep on the football field all day long. Later, because many children didn't have my kind of fanaticism and were unwilling to work as hard as I did without end, the number of people who played football with me sometimes decreased, and even the situation where I didn't have an opponent became commonplace. But my passion for playing football didn't decrease because of this. On the contrary, maybe I played even more vigorously alone, because the best thing about playing football alone is that no one is stealing the ball, and the ball can always be kicked on my own feet." As he said this, he couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"When a person plays football alone, I think it must be very strenuous, right?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not strenuous at all. When there's no one to play against me, I kick the ball against the wall, kicking it back and forth like playing 'Jai Alai', and then kicking it again, over and over again, until I'm sweating and my head feels sore. In this way, it wasn't until the ninth year of the Republic of China that I switched to playing with a big ball. At that time, I was confident that I had a good grasp of football, so the way I practiced was more skillful and practical than before."</p>
<p>"Some people say that you only know how to use your right foot to kick the ball, and your left foot can only help the use of your right foot, and you can't shoot with it, is that right?"</p>
<p>"That's not true. Generally speaking, people use their right foot more to kick the ball, and it's not that there aren't people who can't kick with their left foot, but that's all because they're too casual and not elegant enough. Although they use their right foot more often, it also depends on how the ball is coming. I've been practicing using both feet equally since I was a child. However, when I first started kicking, my left foot was indeed a little less flexible than my right foot, and sometimes when the ball came to my foot, I wanted to use my left foot, but my right foot just wouldn't listen to orders and went forward. Later, I came up with a method, which was not to wear a shoe on my right foot. If it wanted to go forward, I would feel a lightness on my toe and remember to use my left foot. I kicked like this for a long time, and gradually I got used to being able to use both feet at the same time. If someone says that I only know how to use my right foot, it's probably because they saw me kick 'penalty kicks'; because it's impossible not to use your right foot for 'twelve-yard kicks'!"</p>
<p>"That's right, I've seen you use your right foot most of the time when you kick 'penalty kicks'. Maybe your right foot is more reliable, isn't it that every time you kick a 'penalty kick', it goes in?" I said jokingly.</p>
<p>"It's not that my foot is reliable," he said seriously. "It's useless to just kick well, because the goalkeeper isn't dead. You also have to use some wit in your mind at the time. For example, if the goalkeeper is standing on the right, but his defense is on the left, because he expects you to take advantage of the gap to attack, but if you go the other way and shoot towards the side he's standing on, he will definitely only see your foot move and run to the left, but he doesn't expect that your ball will just take advantage of the emptiness on his right side and drive straight in. By the time he turns around to save it, it's already 'too late'. You have to use wit to kick the ball, there's no mistake about that. That's why many people misunderstand that I don't want to run when I play, and say that I'm kicking a 'lazy ball', because they don't understand the role my mind is playing at the time."</p>
<p>"It's true that you don't run when you kick the ball, but in fact, there's no way for you to run at the time."</p>
<p>"That's right! Every time I play against someone, because I have a little bit of fame, as soon as I walk onto the field, I get 'watched', and there's no way for me to run. But I don't think it's very useful to rely solely on running to kick the ball. The most important thing is to be able to see the rising and falling points of a ball. Usually, when you play against someone, you must never just look up at the ball and run after it in the field. That's a stupid move that wastes energy and doesn't get you the ball. The best thing to do is to predict where it will fall when the ball rises, and then quickly run to that side to wait. This way, you can avoid the enemy's attention, and your feet will have enough energy to catch and kick the ball that is about to arrive. Every time I play against foreigners, people don't see me running all over the field to catch the ball, but when the ball gets to my feet, it's not easily taken away by others."</p>
<p>"Needless to say, the Hong Kong team can probably win the football championship in this National Games, right?"</p>
<p>"That's hard to say!"</p>
<p>"In your opinion, which team is more hopeful?"</p>
<p>"Probably!" He lowered his head and pondered for a while: "I think it won't be outside these four teams: Hong Kong, East China, Central China, and Malaya!"</p>
<p>"Does the Malayan team play well?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right. The talents of this team are almost all top players gathered from Singapore, Penang, and Java, so they are more confident when they play. Secondly, the talents of East China and South China are also some veterans who have been on the battlefield for a long time, and their strengths are still average. It's not easy to predict who will win when they clash in the future. As for the Hong Kong team, of course they are not weak, but they haven't had the opportunity to scrimmage with other friendly teams yet, so I don't dare to be confident."</p>
<p>"As for the teams from North China and Central China, I'm afraid there's not much hope, right?"</p>
<p>"Individually, the talents of North China are not bad, but as a whole team, it seems that they lack training in communication. Central China is of course inferior! In summary, it's not that their talents are not as good as those of East China, South China, or Hong Kong, but because of environmental reasons, they rarely have the opportunity to compete and practice with good teams, so it's difficult to improve their level of skill. As for the teams from South China, Hong Kong, and East China, they have good opportunities to compete with foreign teams often, so their skills naturally improve easily. However, the Shanghai football scene has only deteriorated in recent years compared to previous years."</p>
<p>"It is said that you are participating in the National Games this time not only in football, but also in tennis. Did you start practicing tennis after going to Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>"No, I started learning tennis in Australia in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China." As he said this, he took out a pocket watch from his pocket and looked at it, then continued, "I remember it was after attending the Far Eastern Games held in Japan that a group of us went on a distant expedition to Australia, where we met Lin Baohua, and my desire to learn tennis started burning. After returning to China, I was deeply guided by Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, and others, and after exchanging ideas with Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia, my interest in tennis became more and more intense, and I practiced every day without end. By the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Lao Jiang and I partnered to win the Shanghai Open Hard Court Doubles Championship, which confirmed the possibility of tennis continuing to be linked to me. But when I went south to Hong Kong that year, my tennis still couldn't attract much attention. It wasn't until the last Hong Kong Open that I defeated the four-year runner-up 'Finch' in one battle, and then after another battle, I won several times against the defending champion 'Lin Zhen', which made people surprised at how quickly my skills had improved. Therefore, the eyes of the selection committee for inter-port competitions were cast on me."</p>
<p>"Can you also make a prediction about the tennis championship in the National Games?"</p>
<p>"Needless to say! The championship this time is of course in the bag for the Shanghai team. The Shanghai team has superior talents, and the Hong Kong team is certainly not their 'match'. I only hope to lose as few 'eggs' as possible in the competition, that's our blessing!" He couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>As we were talking about this, he seemed to remember something again, took out his watch and looked at it again, and his demeanor was not as relaxed as before, so I quickly got up to say goodbye and came out.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Observations on the United States' Silver Purchase Policy <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Baozhong</p>
<p>Since Roosevelt stepped onto the American political stage as President, he has come up with various remedies for the decline of his country's industry, the surge in unemployed workers, and the economic downturn in society. Among them, the silver purchase policy has won the sympathy of the whole country. The nature of this policy and its impact on China's economy are discussed in order below:</p>
<p>(I) Contents of the Silver Policy.</p>
<p>The main points of this policy are: (A) The ratio of silver to gold should be increased to one-quarter of its currency reserves. In other words, the ratio of silver reserves to gold reserves should be one to three. (B) The U.S. Treasury Department may purchase silver from abroad at any time. The degree of silver purchase is until the silver reserves are equal to one-quarter of the metallic currency reserves. Its price (1) must not exceed its price as currency, (2) for all silver that was already in the United States on May 1, 1934, the purchase price must not exceed 50 cents per ounce in U.S. dollars. In other words, silver outside the United States or silver transported into the United States after May 1 may be purchased at a price above 50 cents. (C) If the price of silver exceeds the price of its silver coins, or the total value of silver coin reserves is greater than 25% of the total value of gold and silver reserves used for currency, the Secretary of the Treasury may sell silver at any time. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is also allowed to issue silver certificates, the face value of which must not be lower than the cost of the silver purchased, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to manage, investigate, or prohibit the purchase, import, and transshipment of silver, and to promulgate such regulations as he deems necessary to implement this plan.</p>
<p>If the silver purchase plan is implemented seriously, then according to the United States' recent reserves of approximately US$7,776,000,000, one-third of which is US$2,589,000,000, this is the value of the amount of silver required for the silver purchase plan. Currently, there are only silver coins worth $841,000,000 in U.S. currency, so an additional $1,74 ,000,000,000 in gold is needed to reach the one-quarter ratio. The current price of silver used for currency in the United States is US$1.29 per ounce, so the amount of U.S. dollars in silver is 1,355,000,000 ounces, which is also the amount of silver the United States intends to buy. This amount of silver, calculated at a market price of no more than 50 cents per ounce in U.S. dollars, requires approximately US$677,500,000.</p>
<p>(II) Sources of silver to be purchased by the United States</p>
<p>There are approximately the following sources of silver to be purchased by the United States: (A) The current excess supply of silver worldwide, that is, in the hands of speculators, is approximately 16,300,000 ounces. In theory, this silver should be the first to be sold. (B) Last year's silver production was 160,000,000 ounces, and this year it has not been able to increase significantly (because silver is mostly a by-product of other minerals, and the production volume is not easy to increase in a short time), so assuming it to be 180,000,000 ounces, it is also possible for the U.S. government to absorb most of it. (C) According to the Pittman International Silver Agreement, the Indian government can sell 35,000,000 ounces each year for the next four years. (D) The maximum estimated silver reserves in Shanghai are approximately 600,000,000 ounces, of which 260,000,000 ounces are owned by foreign banks and 340,000,000 ounces are owned by Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In addition to these four sources, Spain and Russia may also sell silver, but the quantity is very small. However, based on the examination of these four major sources, if the United States only relies on the first and second sources, then by the end of the year, it will only be able to obtain 320,000,000 ounces, which is far from the amount it wants to purchase. However, in fact, all silver owners want to wait for a good price to sell, and China and India have no reason not to sell silver to the U.S. government unless the government finds a way to prevent it. Therefore, if the United States is determined to buy silver, it will undoubtedly buy silver from China and India, especially China, where the degree of silver sales is stronger than in any other country. Because China is a silver-based country, speculators are generally afraid of the export ban on silver, and will try their best to transport it out for sale. Moreover, it is more cost-effective to offset China's annual trade deficit with silver. Foreign banks in the past imported silver at extremely low costs, and now they have a high price to sell, so what is there to be unwilling to do? Currently, silver exports have reached more than 30 million ounces according to customs statistics, and are still</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Continuing to be shipped out for export, because foreign banks have recognized that the transshipment of silver is a very good investment, they will naturally ship it out in a steady stream.</p>
<p>(III) Motives of the U.S. Government in Implementing This Policy</p>
<p>As for the motives of the U.S. government in implementing the silver purchase policy, according to general observations, there are approximately two points: (A) To offset more dangerous bills. Since the current U.S. Congress convened, the silver faction's congressmen have exaggerated their proposals to the extreme, and even bills of sixteen to one or even fifteen to one almost passed, so the silver faction has the authority to manipulate Congress. Although the U.S. President found it difficult to endorse such bills, he had to find a way to perfunctorily approve a more flexible silver purchase bill in order to win the favor of the silver faction's congressmen, and its purpose was certainly not to greatly increase silver transport. This observation is the argument of people in the general foreign exchange market, who believe that the silver purchase bill has the same effect as the previous Thomas Amendment and the 1934 Gold Reserve Act, and that its purpose is political, not monetary, to adopt this consistent policy. (B) To promote price increases or prevent price declines. The silver purchase bill has the same nature as the previous gold purchase plan. If implemented in accordance with the law, it would be sufficient to help raise prices. The gold purchase plan was about suppressing the price of the U.S. currency, thereby raising prices expressed in U.S. currency, but in fact, the price increase was not as fast as the gold price increase, so the gold purchase plan failed. As for this time's purchase of silver and issuance of silver certificates, although it can increase currency and raise prices, it is difficult to predict whether raising prices will be as effective as expected. However, if U.S. prices cannot rise upward in the afternoon of this year, or even have a tendency to fall downward, Roosevelt may also use this policy to alleviate the emergency in order to save prices. Therefore, the motive for implementing this policy may also be to prevent the decline in prices.</p>
<p>Currently, the changes in the U.S. economy have been much calmer than before, labor unrest has gradually decreased, and industries and businesses have gradually become more active with the silver certificates from the government. Most of the unemployed workers have also found a considerable solution to their panic. However, our country has suffered greatly from it. Domestic silver prices have risen with the trend, and silver has flowed to the United States involuntarily. As a result, prices have continued to fall rapidly, and industries and businesses were already in a very depressed state. Coupled with the United States' increase in the purchasing power of the general public, they have collapsed and collapsed one after another. The impact on the rural economy has been even more profound, and the rural by-products can be said to be completely destroyed. If this situation continues, China's future will be unimaginable!</p>

<p>— Yucai</p>
<p>My grandfather, when he was alive, was extremely fond of me, his fatherless grandson. He toiled his entire life, and in his later years, he placed almost all of his hopes on me. I sometimes felt that I was the only one in the family who resembled my grandfather. I had the same stubborn temper as him, and I was confident that I would one day accomplish the same kind of things he had.</p>
<p>My grandfather bore the heavy burden of providing for the food and clothing of over a dozen people spanning three generations, so until his very last breath, he was like a heavily laden camel, even though he was already very old. He spent the entire year managing his business in the city. Three or four times a year, he would return home from the city with his hunched back and gray hair for a short rest.</p>
<p>The month or so that my grandfather was at home was the liveliest time for our family. He would bring back fruits from the city like apples, grapes, and crabapples, distributing them one by one to us children. We would hold the stems of the apples and run around the streets, showing them off. Once, he even brought back a small toy gun. After dinner, when the old man was in high spirits after drinking some wine, he would squint his eyes happily, pretending to aim the gun and shoot us. We would grab my grandfather's hand and laugh wildly, and my grandfather would be so happy that tears would stream down his face.</p>
<p>Our neighbor, an elderly Mrs. Li, was already in her nineties. She was a generation older than my grandfather. Besides being slightly hard of hearing, she was still quite spry. She often visited the neighbors, especially our house, almost every day, to chat for a few words. This had become almost a daily routine. When my grandfather was home, he would happily drink about half a kilogram of Shaoxing wine with each meal, talking to us children. Mrs. Li would come to do her routine at this time. Seeing my grandfather drinking Shaoxing wine, she would sit down next to him. My grandfather knew that she didn't like to drink, so he would pick out some soft, easy-to-eat foods for her to taste and loudly tell her the names of those rare foods. We children watched Mrs. Li nodding her head in such a way, and everyone laughed heartily again. Seeing the children's happy smiles, Mrs. Li patted my grandfather's back and said, "Zhiqing, you are really blessed with good fortune. You have such a harmonious pair of grandsons who will be even better than you in the future!" My grandfather had nothing to say. He stroked his beard slightly, a mixture of bitterness and joy welling up in his heart. Finally, he let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>My grandfather loved to hear such compliments, and he also loved that moment of bittersweet flavor. He had indeed placed all his hopes on me.</p>
<p>Later, with my grandfather's fervent hopes, I entered normal school. Three years of cruel education completely wounded my childlike innocence. My personality suddenly changed from innocent purity to cold melancholy. These years were truly the most unfortunate years of my life, harming my vitality. In June, I dragged my sorrowful body back to my hometown, my heart forever filled with gloom. Every day, I wanted to emulate the poets and use pure wine to wash away the sorrows in my heart. Sometimes, I would hide alone in a deserted place, holding a book of Tang poetry and reciting it aloud. When I read a passage that evoked a bleak scene, I felt as if I were actually in that situation, and unconsciously, hot tears would fill my cheeks. In this way, it was as if I had hysteria! After a few days, my grandfather returned home for his summer rest as usual, but my heart was no longer as innocent as it had been when I was a child. My grandfather was not very happy when he saw my state this time.</p>
<p>One afternoon, my mother told me that my grandfather had quietly returned to the city. This made me feel very abrupt. My mother also told me, "Your grandfather left very unhappy. He said, 'Yun'er is very arrogant. This child has no great hope.' The old man seemed very angry and dejected!"</p>
<p>Hearing my mother's words, my melancholy heart became even more melancholy. I thought about why my elderly grandfather had returned to the city so quietly, and I thought about how my gray-haired grandfather was being tormented by pain because of me, gnawing at his heart that had been wounded so many times! The more I thought about it, the more I finally cried!</p>
<p>I had disappointed even my most loving grandfather!</p>
<p>Arrogant. That is how my grandfather criticized me, and that is how he disliked me. Those so-called teachers had also criticized me in this way, but I remained arrogant forever. I had just left childhood when arrogance occupied my entire life.</p>
<p>In the following years, my grandfather passed away, and the family suffered repeated misfortunes. The burden that my grandfather had carried for decades unconditionally fell on my shoulders, but I still had that same arrogant temper.</p>
<p>"Yun'er is very arrogant. This child has no great hope!" My grandfather's words often echoed in my mind. I constantly savored the sad expression on my grandfather's face when he said these words.</p>
<p>I have been drifting in the sea of humanity for several years now. During these years, I have suffered so many cold stares from the world, so much cruel bullying. I am often angry, but I often endure it. I swallow the tears that fill my eyes because I still have to bear that heavy burden!</p>
<p>I have cured my arrogance. I have cured the problem that my grandfather could not cure. I am no longer arrogant. I endure all the sufferings of the world, bearing a heavy burden of life like my grandfather did when he was alive, treading the long road of life to the end!</p>
<p>Grandfather! Your Yun'er is no longer arrogant, but where is this child's hope now?</p>

<h3 id="e209">Idealistic Literary Criticism <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xingcong</p>
<p>In philosophy, there is the opposition between idealism and materialism. Similarly, in literary criticism, there is the opposition between idealistic criticism and sociological scientific criticism. Moreover, in the field of literary criticism, idealism has always had a great influence. Horizontally speaking, so-called appreciation criticism, aesthetic criticism, impressionistic criticism, and ethical criticism, although each has its own characteristics, can all be said to belong to the ranks of idealistic literary criticism in the end. Vertically speaking, from the literary criticism of Plato and Aristotle in ancient times, through the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, and then through Classicism and Romanticism, all literary criticism before Naturalism can be said to be idealistic criticism. In other words, all literary criticism before Taine was dominated by idealistic theories.</p>
<p>In fact, Plato explained poetry with illusory inspiration. He paid special attention to ethical effects, so he argued that "the function of the poet, the privilege of the poet, and the reason for the poet's existence is to provide us with non-realistic things." His literary criticism, guided by such a view, was naturally very mysterious. When he was dissatisfied with poets, he even banished them from his "Republic," believing that "poets are blasphemers of God." At the same time, although Aristotle is regarded as the "father of literary criticism," and his "Poetics" is indeed the most valuable literary criticism work of ancient times that no one can deny, due to the limitations of the times, from a modern perspective, we cannot help but say that even his famous "Poetics" is not a perfect work. Moreover, in the end, his masterpiece is still biased towards pure technical research and is written from an idealistic standpoint. In "Poetics," Aristotle attempted to explain the origin of poetry with the instinct of imitation and the instinct of harmonious desire, which led him to enter the world of idealism. Furthermore, he discussed narrative poetry, tragedy, comedy, and Greek hymns from an idealistic perspective. For example, in commenting on tragedy, he made the following claims about the characters' personalities: (1) The character should be good; (2) The character should have appropriateness, such as a man being brave is very good, but a woman being brave is not good-looking; (3) The character should be faithful to life; (4) The character should be consistent from beginning to end. From this, it can be seen that he did not objectively explain why the characters appearing in the plays are like that and what their meaning is from a social perspective, but rather subjectively stipulated how the characters' personalities should be. Due to his subjective idealistic viewpoint, in his principles of literary criticism, like Plato, he also paid attention to ethical effects. Moreover, he also made many rules to be followed in form, such as the well-known "three unities" of Classicism after the Renaissance, which came from his "Poetics."</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, because mankind was dominated by a natural economy, they developed extremely isolated and helpless thoughts and feelings. Everything could only hope for the help of heaven and the spirit. Therefore, the expression of various human thoughts at this time was stained with a strong theological color, and various literary works naturally expressed mystical thoughts and feelings. Such as the so-called heroic poems, religious moral poems, knight stories, parables in the Bible, and Oriental tales and legends, are all painted with the colors of miracles and mystery. As for literary criticism, it was naturally theological. By the time of the Renaissance, although this medieval theological thought had ended, with the revival of the spirit of antiquity, Aristotle's idealistic literary criticism showed its new development again. The so-called classical literary criticism can be said to be the revival and development of Aristotle's literary criticism. Later, the rise of Romanticism, although it broke the "three unities" of Classicism, liberated emotions, and developed individuality, also because of this, Romantic literary criticism was also dressed in the colorful clothes of idealism. Like literary propositions, Wordsworth's literary criticism, are all idealistic.</p>
<p>From the above description, we can see that from Plato and Aristotle to the Romantic era, literary criticism was dressed in the colorful clothes of idealism. Although in the middle of this, the literary criticism that appeared in each era was a reflection of the thoughts of the social people of each era, and because the social people of each era were different, the literary criticism of each era also had its own characteristics. But in the end, we can still assert that the literary criticism from ancient times to the Romantic era was dressed in the colorful clothes of idealism. For example, Classicism and Romanticism, from the perspective of the development of literary history, the latter is the negation of the former, and their ideas are certainly different. But in that they both subjectively advocated that literature should be like this and did not evaluate literature from an objective social perspective, in that they used "reason" or "emotion" to explain literature and could not further examine the source of the thoughts and feelings expressed in literary works and their social value, we can still say that their literary criticism is also idealistic criticism.</p>
<p>Of course, idealistic literary criticism did not disappear after Romanticism. On the contrary, it continued to appear in various forms in the literary criticism world. However, we do not want to elaborate on this here. What is most important to us at this time is to explain and criticize several major modern idealistic literary criticism.</p>
<p>Speaking of idealism, people will never forget Hegel. He is not only the completer of the idealistic philosophical system, the greatest representative of idealistic philosophy, but also the representative of the greatest idealistic view of art in modern times. His famous "Aesthetics" can be said to be a classic of idealistic aesthetics. In the middle of this, he has a very detailed analysis of many artistic finished products, but in the end, he always explains art with empty spirit, ideas, and inspiration. For example, although his explanation of medieval Gothic architecture is very detailed, he fundamentally believes that all the characteristics of Gothic architecture are expressions of the Christian spirit. As for why Gothic temples express the Christian spirit rather than other spirits? How did the so-called Christian spirit of the Middle Ages arise? Hegel did not consider this fundamental question.</p>
<p>In addition to Hegel, Schopenhauer is also a famous idealist; and he has also published more mysterious discussions on art and literature. He fundamentally denies that art and literature are products of human society. He once said that even if the universe loses its existence, music still exists, as long as there is wind. As for literary criticism, he mystified criticism because of his worship of genius. He said at the beginning of his discussion of criticism: "The following brief notes on critical talent are mostly to show that the world does not have this thing. It is a very rare bird, in fact, almost as rare as the phoenix that comes out once every five hundred years." Since he believed that criticism was so mysterious, his own criticism of literature would naturally be very mysterious. In addition to mysteriously praising the talents of many geniuses and sighing at their experiences, the result was almost to eliminate literary criticism.</p>
<p>The development of idealistic literary criticism reached its extreme in Aestheticism. The literary criticism of Wilde, the first of Aestheticism, is its representative. In Wilde's view, nothing has any meaning except for empty, mysterious "rarity," "charm," and "beauty." He once used his aesthetic theory to criticize Zola, saying: "From an artistic point of view, Zola's works are almost worthless, only zero points. The characters in his works are all decadent and pitiful people, the crystallization of sin. The lives of these characters are meaningless records. Who can pay attention to these people? Our requirements for art are rarity, charm, and imagination, simply beauty." This is really the expression of the extreme development of the mysterious theory of idealism. Under such a mysterious theory, Zola, the naturalist who pays attention to "sketching from life," is of course to be negated.</p>
<p>However, after Wilde's aesthetic literary criticism, idealistic literary criticism continued to appear in various forms in the critical world. Here we can cite the currently popular impressionistic criticism. The so-called impressionistic criticism denies a certain standard of literary criticism and evaluates literature solely based on personal subjective temporary impressions. Impressionists hold a personal subjective skeptical attitude, do not believe in the existence of objective literary criticism standards, and fundamentally deny that literature has a practical social basis. The famous impressionist A. France said in his "Literary Life": "Aesthetics has no solid foundation, it is a castle in the air. Some people want to place its foundation on ethics, but there is no so-called ethics. Sociology also does not have it. ... To establish criticism, people often say tradition and common acceptance. However, these things do not exist. General public opinion recognizes a certain work, this is a fact. However, this is preconceived, it is definitely not from a free state of mind, nor is it the result of spontaneous love. The works that everyone praises are works that no one has ever savored." In this way, everything is gone, and what remains is only the individual's subjective impression, then the so-called individual's subjective impression is without practical basis, mysterious and incomprehensible. The influence of such mysterious and incomprehensible impressionism even makes people fundamentally deny the existence of objective truth, saying that there is no correct literary theory at all, and even saying that there is no such thing as an introduction to literature. But in the end, its theory is still a theoretical form of idealism existing in objective society.</p>
<p>The French Wan Long said,"No science has been oppressed by metaphysical fantasies as much as aesthetics. Since Plato until modern public doctrine, the general public often makes art into a delicate fantasy and mysterious object, so that the highest words are actually restricted to the special scope of beautiful, unchanging, God's scope, substantial ideas." This is a correct diagnosis. Because art and literature are the uppermost social ideologies that are farther away from the social foundation, and it is not easy to directly see the relationship between them and the social foundation, so metaphysics - idealism is the easiest to extend its power in this field in various poses.</p>

<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>New Zealand</p>
<p>New Zealand, also commonly known as New Zealand, is also one of the five major self-governing dominions of Great Britain. The status of overseas Chinese here is roughly the same as in Australia. According to investigations, more than fifty years ago, there were 4,215 overseas Chinese here. However, the local government and people paid very close attention to overseas Chinese and frequently ostracized them. In 1907, the new government stipulated that all overseas Chinese entering the country must pass an English test of one hundred words. As a result, overseas Chinese in New Zealand could not develop.</p>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in New Zealand are from Guangdong, and most of them are small businessmen and horticulturalists. It is said that their lives are not very bad.</p>
<p>The West Indies are originally the world of black people, but the political and economic power is entirely in the hands of Europeans and Americans. Because overseas Chinese are able to endure hardship and are hard-working, they also have quite a bit of strength in general industry and commerce; although recently the mixed race of black people and white people here have been quite active in general occupational sectors and are competing with overseas Chinese, they cannot shake their inherent position.</p>

Later, Ya Mengquan came up with an idea to flatten the uneven icebergs, so everyone worked together and in twenty-four days, they built an airfield 500 meters long. The six people safely returned on a plane.</p>
<p>After this failure, Ya Mengquan felt that the plane was not suitable for Arctic exploration. He had failed with steamships before, so he thought of huge airships and later borrowed one from Italy. This time, seventeen people went, and although they encountered danger when they were about to reach their destination, they eventually succeeded. After more than thirty years of hard work, Ya Mengquan achieved his life's wish. (End)</p>

<p>Fingers snapping, another late autumn. Hastily, years pass by and are hard to keep. Today is the Double Ninth Festival. Let's talk about the west wind entering the small building. Checking poems, avoiding chaos and going. Where to find a barren hill to ascend. The eight wildernesses are difficult to , home and country. Thousands of miles of rivers and mountains are full of sorrow. Swallowing the sound, the people's spirit is as urgent as the autumn tide. Only seeing the red maple leaves flowing with tears of blood. Governing the country, suppressing the Communists, and suppressing bandits. Years of war are also difficult to stop. Although the common people escape from war. Where to throw the hardships of life. There are more natural disasters waiting for man-made disasters. The boundless flood is causing the people to worry. . The embankment is not . The great Shenzhou will be short from now on.

<p>Yue Feng's new work, "Wedding Night," is scheduled to begin filming this month, starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, and Ye Juanjuan.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Times" will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Shen Tianyin, Fang Peilin, and Xu Suling will be directors. Shen Tianyin will film "Wang Baochuan" entirely in English with sound. Fang Peilin will film "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," entirely dubbed. Xu Suling will film "Song of the Yangtze River," entirely with sound and dialogue.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song" will be going to Qingjiangpu in the coming days to shoot outdoor scenes. The completion of "Triumphant Song" is also approaching.</p>
<p>Sound engineer Gu Zongyi has recently built a new recording machine with exceptionally good results. Therefore, Yihua's sound film productions will have a more powerful guarantee in the future.</p>
<p>Hu Ping wrote from her hometown in Hunan, saying that she can return to Shanghai at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Guo Bolin is currently engaged in translating the Japanese dialogue of "Triumphant Song" and "Hero of the Times."</p>
<p>Since Wu Bangfan joined Yihua to oversee business matters, Yihua's business has been thriving daily.</p>

<p>These days, the name Yang Xiuqiong is much more famous than Hu Die.</p>
<p>"Kamera's Whimsical Collection" reports: "Bao Kehua will compile 'Era Movie,' the first issue will have Yuan Muzhi's grand article, and two pages of stills from the play 'Metropolitan Scenery'. --Note: This is not a 'preview', but a 'prediction'."</p>
<p>Yi Ya Jun "also reportedly" said: "Ye Lingfeng and Cheng Shiying once stuffed Wang Ying's works into modern magazines, so that she was able to squeeze into the group of writer-stars." (See October 4th, Times)</p>
<p>The "Tofu Shop" has an opening announcement for October 12th. According to the shop owner Dong, there is no "Tofu Beauty" in the shop.</p>
<p>The date of the performance of Gogol's "The Inspector General" is still uncertain. According to reliable sources, "The Inspector General" will be inspected next month.</p>
<p>Addendum: In the jottings of the 4th, below "Female stars unveiling for others, etc., boring things are decreasing now", there was originally a note (written after the opening of a certain silk shop). I don't know why it was omitted. As it is related to what I saw and heard, I hereby correct it as above.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Experimental Theater Troupe Will Perform Soon <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Plays: Good and Evil, The Fugitive, The Last Prayer</p>
<p>Since the Experimental Theater Troupe participated in the first performance of the French Molière play The Miser at the Flood Relief Fundraising Association, it has completely separated from the Performing Arts Laboratory. Currently, Liu Yawei and Chen Tu, former members of the Chunqiu Society, are responsible for promoting the work of the troupe. Yesterday, a performance committee was established at Xinya, and it was decided to realize the second performance before the end of October. The selected plays are Good and Evil (three-act play), The Last Prayer (two-act play), and The Fugitive (one-act play). It is said that in addition to Liu Yawei, Lu Shi and Zuo Ming and other playwrights will also help with directing.</p>
