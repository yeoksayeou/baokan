<h3>國際對華貸欵之瞻顧</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自東方合作之聲浪日以喧。西方注意之力亦日以深。英議員頻起質問。美當局復作表示。國聯之理事。昔曾求之而遭杏决。今亦有唾手可得之勢。登真「士别三日。刮目相待。」蓋爲大勢所趨。利害關係。事到臨頭。不得不出而作嘗指於鼎分我盃羮之想。固焉英國本其援助吾華之美意。出而向美法日提出供給中國財政援助之建議。聞美已有切實提携之表示。日則似乎表示其不滿。目下國際間之競爭。情形異常複雜。將來事態發展至如何地歩。以及列强間為利害關系而如何鈎心鬥角。兹姑不必加以懸揣。但東西良友。一番美意。如何承受。此為值得吾人所注意者也。</p>
<p>間嘗謂借債要有資格。如英國人借美國人之債。除雙方約定之條欵外。别無作用毫無問題若中國人借外國人之債。事實上恐不能如此簡單。例如一九二零年四國借欵團之曹返對。正爲欲監督我財政而開國際共管之端。一九一六年澀澤榮一投資於我國。所以引起疑懼則為欲以美國人之金錢。經日人之手而轉借於我。含有政治作用也。今昔情形固不同。但外人心目中之中國。能否與吾人自視所自信者相同。實一至關重大之問題。或竟無變故態。借欵仍求有監督之權。或避名就實。用合作之名。施攘奪之實。均不可不防。蓋政治興經濟。名為二而實則一。自有其不可分者在也。</p>
<p>再則借欵之運用。所關亦鉅。用之得當。固可以興國。用失其當。亦可以亡國。水能載舟。亦能覆舟。故借欵之用途宜愼。在昔所借之外債。往往供政費之挪移。爲私人作彌補。今則當無此病。勢必用諸生産建設。幣制整理之類。以樹經濟復興之基礎。此借債之所以興國者也。然借外債而辦實業。常受債權者之干涉。此其一。以雇用外人為條件。此其二。材料一切向彼購買。此其三。辦理而得當。固較不辦爲善。然與外人合作。往往出巨大之薪給。僅得一紙之報告。或因不明中國之國情。甚致强施以難行之舉措。功半事倍。堂奥盡失。此其爲利爲害。又難言之矣。</p>
<p>夫造成中國今日物資缺乏之局面。外國人亦應分任其咎。蓋自洋貨以中國爲唯一推銷之所。專以榨取中國人金錢爲能事。既破壞其原有之生産事業。又不助其爲新的建設。致有金窮財盡之今日。並外國貨而亦無力購買。事固無異於殺雞求卵。又如美國之吸收白銀。以為可提高銀價。促進中國之購買力。殊不知中國之銀早為購用洋貨銷耗垂盡。即有存者。大都爲洋銀行庫中之白銀。彼見有利可圖。置中國市塲危險於不顧。紛紛外運。遂造成中國今日不得不極度緊縮之局面。故若中國人真富於白銀。美國人之辦法。尚不失為一種辦法。無如中國人已精疲力盡。銀雖貴美國貨雖便宜。大多數人仍不得不望望然而去之。美國人之所得無多。而所加害於中國者則已甚巨。故外人固欲援助中國。應放棄其榨取政策。而顧念中國現在處境之困難。减輕其足可加增困難之因素。一面切實援助合於中國需要之生産建設。以增加中國人之生産力。即所以增加中國人對洋貨之購買力。然外人見不及此。祇顧目前之利。你爭我奪。絶不留後來餘地。若此後之對華貸欵。仍以爭奪權力爲事。榨取利源為務。則於中國固無利。於外人亦豈有益。</p>
<p>中山先生嘗力主國際共同發展中國實業之說。其所望於投資之各國者。「（一）投資之各政府。務須共同行動。統一政策。組成一國際團。用其組織。管理人才。熟練技師。令其設計有統系。用物有準度。以免浪費。以便作工。（二）必須得中國人民之信仰。使其熱心匡助此舉。（三）即爲與中國政府。開正式會議。議此計畫之最後契約。」如此則「可使中國開一新市塲。既以銷其自産之貨。又能銷外國所産。而兩不相妨。」中山先生此議。雖發於十餘年前。但仍爲今日中國所應守之原則。蓋生産事業。誠能發展。則中國財政亦何待援助。方有辦法。至若整理幣制。亦爲建設之一端。無須别論。吾人原不欲在未成爲事實之前。多所評述。以上所言。亦不過抒所見。以供國人參考而已。</p>

<h3>英美合作援助中國目前碍難實行</h3>
<p>主張聯合法意諸國共同實行</p>
<p>日本完全控制中國爲不可能</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務副卿費利潑斯、與英國大使林德賽會晤之後、對於林德賽所建議單獨由英美兩國在財政上援助中國之計劃、認爲與華盛頓九國公約暨一九二○年國際銀行團恊定、互相抵觸、碍難實行、而以美國政府而論、在目前亦未見有援助中國之可能、林氏當即聲明、英美兩國若恝置中國、殆即以中國委諸日本、任其支配、費氏答稱、中國幅員廣闊、日本若欲完全加以控制、所遇困難、誠不知何所底止、至欲美國與英法意及其他關係國家、共相合作以援助中國、亦非不可能之事云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美拒絶發表意見</h3>

<h3>英美關係接近</h3>

<p>（甲）省內部分、該行當二十一年改組時、因環境及經費關係、曾將省內分行、裁撤九處、現在信用、逐漸恢復、資本按經濟建設實際需要、改六千六百萬元爲一千二百萬元、十年撥足、每月籌撥十萬元、已於去歳七月份起、按月撥到、爲調劑全省金融計、自宜廣設分支機關、俾全省脈絡、得以漸次貫通、惟是全省普設分行處、開支浩繁、結果必將不貲、因仿中國銀行辦法、多設寄莊、少設分行處、在事實上、可收相當之效果、在經費上、可免無謂之開支、如此進行、似覺利多而害少、因於去年內將天津分行、改爲寄莊、范村辦事處、事務簡單、併入太谷辦理、而將岢嵐·河曲·隰縣·離石·四處、一律改爲寄莊、添派行員、以資進行、又於文水·介休·壽陽·增設寄莊三處、並擬於今年再擇商業稍繁之處、亦增設寄莊、以冀達普遍之目的、（乙）省外部分、滙兑一項、在銀行業務上、佔最要部分、該行自改組以來、省外業務機關、僅留天津綏遠兩處、對於向省外大商埠之滙兑調運、時感滯塞不靈、聲氣難通之苦、又該行代理金庫、收解各縣公欵、尤爲重要工作、王氏以若不妥籌滙兑靈敏之法、則不特於應用上諸多不便、且運送費用、亦屬虚耗考查本省硬幣之來源、除沿邊各縣以糧食煤炭土産向外省換回外、大半以晋南棉及鹽之售出換運入境、該行及各錢商、又由晋南轉運來省而省垣附近縣分、又因交易上之需要、輾轉輸運出省、因此該行全年運送現欵費、常不下二三萬元、近自隴海路直通西安、連雲港建築碼頭以來、晋南商業趨勢、殆將脱開天津而趨向陝鄭滬漢等處、以後營業進行、自須在陝鄭滬漢各埠着眼、因派行員專赴陝豫滬漢調查一次、擬即遴選妥員、分往各處設置、以資進展、如此一轉、硬幣之需要自少、運費之支出亦减、滙撥暢通、營業日進、而市面之氣象、亦自改觀矣、</p>
<p>營業情形</p>
<p>該行爲公營事業、章程所載以調劑全省金融、扶植經濟建設爲宗旨、其性質上已與普通銀行不同、故營業方針、自不能不以社會利益爲前提、舉凡經濟建設、公私實業、苟有扶植價值者、莫不量力資助、至於充實內部、鞏固基礎、尤爲平日注意之要點、惟其有鞏固之基礎、充實之內部、所以於去年六月間、發生擠兑風潮時、得以鎭静態度、盡量以兑現之法應付之、結果三日之間、即行平息、此後該行信用、乃昭著於社會、發行效率、益較順利、不特一般商民樂於週使、即郵政鐵路、亦一律取受而通矣、按擠兑時之發行額、爲四百餘萬元、截至月前年終核計、竟達五百八十餘萬元、足徵該行身價隆起、社會信仰之心、愈以普遍、此後决將內部益加充實、將來基礎、自必益加鞏固、按去年純益總數爲四十二萬六千二百零三元六角九分、除照章攤提外、又撤除三萬餘元、净獲純益三十五萬八千零八十五元三角三分、較之上年份增加一十一萬九千九百零一元九角一分、處此農村破産、民生凋敝之今日、居然有此結果、誠屬難能可貴、</p>
<p>開支實况</p>
<p>該行改組後、每月經費、定爲一萬九千五百六十四元、按當時開支所需、已屬最低限度、去歳爲應社會環境之需要、營業範圍、已有擴張之趨勢、現在共有分行九處、辦事處九處、寄莊九處、代理店二十九處、業務既繁、開支必多、而而年終結算、不但未曾超過概算、尚較原定限額節省大洋二萬一千一百四十九元五角四分、此固由於該行同人之工作勤奮、支用撙節、而提倡土貨、與實行新生活之效力、亦屬不少、（二月二十二日）</p>

<h3>鄂省整理航政經過</h3>
<p>建設廳航政處之報告</p>
<p>漢口通信、省政府建設廳航政處代管內河航輪一年報告、其文如次、</p>
<p>「內河航輪、從去年二月起試辦、三月一日正式接管、到今天適足一年、牠工作的複雜、意義的嚴重、責任的巨大、像我才識淺陋、且學的是電機工程、不懂得海商運輸專門學問、濫竽盲幹、實覺慚愧、假使早得人選、牠的成績必十倍於今天、差幸上蒙委員長主席廳長秘書等指示、復承廳內同仁、處內全體員工、以奮鬥的精神、恊力共赴巨艱、一年之中、未遭意外巨變、航商亦得坐享巨利、公衆亦得减價便利、我們不敢居功、只誠心表示感謝而已、</p>
<p>航輪的現狀很簡單、拿數字可以報告、代管航輪共六十七艘、租用航輪共十五艘、依機器分、計蒸汽輪六十三艘、柴油輪十九艘、依船身分、鋼輪九艘、木壳七十三艘、依大小分、長十丈以上的一艘、九丈以上的十六艘、八丈以上的二十七艘、計算排水量噸數、約共五千九百噸、依年齡分、一年內新造的○艘、二年內的三艘、三年內的十六艘、三年外的六十三艘、從這幾個數字、可明瞭他基礎且不健全、目總排水量共只六千噸、不及招商局江華三千六百九十三噸排水量的二倍、更比不上行駛中美間加拿大皇后號的二萬噸、假使比英國新近下水的Queen　Mary號的七萬三千噸、要小十二倍、全部內航輪船估價祇值七十五萬元、比不上招商局新造四海輪中一艘的半數、海元號造價要一百四十萬元、可憐我們拿得這些破爛東西、要維持全省內水一千五百公里的航綫交通、而在接管伊始、引起絶大風潮、可見我國生産落後的程度、到不可思議了航輪班次、現共二十一班、每天開四次的有漢口蔡甸班、每天開二次的有漢口陽邏班、每天開一次的有漢口團風班·武穴班·鄂城班·黄石港班·葛店班·倉子埠班·彭家塲班·新堤班·金口班·黄陵磯班·新溝班·沙洋班·又沙市宜昌班·沙市藕池班·沙市郝穴班·新溝長江埠班·隔天開一次的有漢口朱河班·毛家口班·每星期開三次的有漢口藕池班·厲行嚴守鐘點、訂定劃一票價、已爲大衆所知道、每天平均約有六千八百人乘船、</p>
<p>航輪收支、每月結賬、從二月半到六月底總結一次、收入共二十一萬一千六百十二元六角、支出共十八萬七千二百三十九元七角一分、盈餘共二萬四千三百七十二元八角九分、盈餘分配方法、半數發船東紅利合年利八厘、加官息八厘、共一分六厘、下半年從七月到十二月底總結一次、營業收入共六十萬另四百七十六元零五分、支出共四十三萬零一百十九元六角二分、結存十八萬零三百五十六元四角三分、所有官息及修理折舊等欵、均已支訖、惟尚有三分之一船隻因時不及、未曾照案上坡大修、故决定在上項結存內、先提修理費四萬元、趕修各船、再照案提公益金五千元、餘數一半發給航商爲紅利、以船本估價計算、達年利二分三厘之鉅、加之官息八厘、綜合三分一厘、可謂武漢各業之冠、比之去年六月底結賬分派官息八厘紅利八厘、綜共一分六厘、已加一倍矣、上項官息每月支付、下半年紅利亦於陰歷年底前發給二分、餘數將於本月底發淸、此外折舊一項、鋼輪照七厘算、木輪照一分算、亦每月底依各輪行駛天數發放現額、故船東得益在四分左右、所存盈餘其他半數、上半年一萬零一百八十六元四角五分、下半年六萬七千六百七十八元二角二分、綜共七萬七千八百六十四元六角七分、照案作爲整理航路之用、將購置挖泥機疏濬河道、以及建築水閘、均在設計中、省府昨會議討論時、以官息紅利合共三分一厘、以超過公用事業監督條例限制利益二分五厘以上、惟爲體恤航商及保守政府威信計、决定仍全數照案發給、但是船東上半年得了一分六厘、下半年得了三分一厘、可滿足麽、不、中國人絶對不會滿足、假使對於事業不滿足、力求擴充、那是好現狀、可惜大部分人是對於金錢利益不滿足、更可證明一年以前航商口口聲聲説虧損、而實際上剝削到的利益恐不止百分之百吧、拿航業比國內其他各業、有怎麽一樣、</p>
<p>我們試辦內航一年、因人力設備種種關係、十分之九還没有辦好、而最感痛苦的、是航商不合作、我們本着奮鬥無畏的精神向前、不顧一切離間破壞、冒着絶大危險幹去、譬如去年三月初航輪全數逃往九江、除以六艘小輪維持航綫外、奉令往蘄州押回逃輪、我們坐的漢興輪、夜中行駛、在石灰窰和亞細亞油行的明光輪互撞、雙方船壳均撞巨洞、離水面僅二寸、所幸雙方均空載、否則水進船艙、必犧牲矣、我們爲事業着想、他非所知、故種種難關、均得打破、其他困難、再可簡略報告幾項、</p>
<p>海員是航業的基本人材、航業的興衰存亡、實和海員同舟共難、可是有一部份非艙面艙底海員、而假着海員的名義、忘肆要求、在大輪船上尚保存着中艙部茶房制度、我們却已打破、在內航船上自始絶對没有人討一文小帳、這是一件、</p>
<p>苛捐雜税、到處皆是、中央雖明令取銷、還保留學捐一種、以前內河航輪、躉捐·票捐·人頭捐·保安捐·教育捐·商會捐·落地捐·不下五六十種、我們完全廢除、除船票外、不許多收搭客一文錢、這是第二件、</p>
<p>湖北一省之內、設立海關三處、於是從沙市宜昌到漢口貨物、必須完納轉口税、一國之內、從甲地到乙地、稱爲出口、已屬奇異、爲世界各國所絶無、而今、省之內、從甲地到乙地到丙地、亦稱出口、須要納税、更屬費解、影響所及、土貨擁積內地、不能銷售、於復興農村之旨大背、但我們不可違抗中央規定、況海關制度、牽涉內外債信用、故在保護土産又不變更海關辦法之下、上江輪船不直接開駛沙市宜昌、祇開到藕池、在藕池派有轉運員、在沙市設立事務所、漢沙宜之貨物、均在藕池轉船、絶不躭擱日期、又不增收客商分文駁轉費用、如此避免繳納轉口稅、其利益仍由客商得之、雖經海關扣船、交涉幾次、今已無問題、此是第三件、</p>
<p>軍警沿途檢查、一則遲誤時間、二則發生糾紛、本處內航規定在碼頭岸上檢查、而航輪中途、除規定之碼頭外、絶對不許停駛起缷或上載客貨、以免偷漏、此項辦法、幾次與禁烟督察處、鹽務稽核處、及其他駐地軍警磋商、卒得諒解、蒙合作辦理、故上船檢查事、已不再見、記得城陵磯湖南省米捐局、勒令本處航輪停檢、每擔米抽捐一元、本處以內航並不行駛湘境、無受檢付捐之義務、該局哨兵數次實彈射擊、危險殊甚、後經省府電湘、始得制上、此是第四件、</p>
<p>軍警搭乘車輪、依照部定辦法、原須購半票、本處以本省尚在剿匪期內、特予便利、凡服裝符號齊全、帶有護照路單者、准免購票、此外必須一律購票、並無半票辦法、乃時有非現役軍警、以及招募新兵、或差役政警等、不明規則、紛滋事端、幸由各隊部上級長官維持交通、嚴厲取締、隨時制止、已實不勝且煩矣、此是第五件、</p>
<p>省內小輪、本由建廳管理、此項主權、係於民十五向海關交涉收回、待民二十交通部設立漢口航政局、重徵小輪檢丈費、水處於貝二十二即停收檢文穹今在代管期內、本廳原無再徵之理、而航政局、屢請交檢、依中央與地方分權原則而言、省內事權、固屬於地方政府也、此點當已爲各方所諒解、渡過第六件困難、</p>
<p>旅途險阻、原屬常事、估橘欺騙、船上今已矣色跡、股匪搶刦、僅去年天門班愼安輪一次、賴地方軍警保安團隊之力、擒獲載匪划夫一人、及嫌疑犯一人、今尚在軍法審訊中、足寒賊膽、本廳復集中路航部隊、加緊訓練、購備新式槍械、分段佈防、去冬安然渡過、解決第七件困難、</p>
<p>本省航路、夏則急流、冬則淺涸、倉子埠班天門班至十一月即停駛、長江埠雖有新溝淺灘隔斷、今年新溝內留置一輪、啣接開駛、可稱未曾間斷、沙洋班昔年十月間即停駛、今年僱用引水人分段探泓、設置水標、耗費千餘元、得長年維持每日開班、其也各班、絶卡間斷、陰歷新年亦未停駛、雖屬易辦之事、惟以前却無人辦過、這是第八件、</p>
<p>調遣軍差船隻佔四分之一、全選大船、同時要維持全數航班、再要應付陰歷年底擁擠的客貨、不得已用拖輪等頂替、勉強渡過、這是第九件因難、</p>
<p>所管船隻、一大半是爛的壞的、我們設機廠自己修理、機廠沒有開辦費、利用舊機、只有三千元週轉金、日夜趕忙、亦勉強渡過、這是第十件困難、</p>
<p>其他瑣瑣屑屑難處、天天時時刻刻碰到、亦不必細說、總之、我們全心全力全副精神去解决罷了、</p>
<p>我們費精神去辦這事、有甚麽目標、是不是代政府賺一些紅利、不是、我們試辦一年、是試騐一種政策、就是公用事業管理方法、商辦失敗、官辦亦不安定、官督商辦、更多敷衍流弊、我們前年監督竟成電燈公司、沒有得到好結果、現在創議「商督公營」、內航的監察委員會實是商督、有商會及銀行公會代表、有會計師查帳、可惜航商沒有用合作善意來監督、而公營方面、則政府已盡了他的力量、實踐了諾言、分派了紅利、假使不是公營依今年不景氣狀態、航業不知將低落到什麽程度、而上述的十種困難、絕對不能解決一件、現在試騐了一年、我們的方法證明是健全的、「商督公營」、可以應用於一切的公用事業、此種政策、採英美保護資本之主張、而應用俄德統制管理之手段、集人之長、以適合中國國情、惟他的組織、必須再嚴密確定、不受政治影響、然後事業的基礎、方可安如磐石了、詳細設計、却不能在這裏報告、內航將來是否如此、我們須候省府决定、今尚不可得知、我們對於內航票價貨價、屢次减低、亦在試騐一種政策、依經濟學論、物價高漲、則産業發達、生活高漲、則人民程度提高、但在中國、則物價與生活費比例、和外國比較、相差太遠、美國煤鑛工人、平均工資每天可得三元、買一個麵包只五分、故一天所入可買六十個麵包、中國工人每天僅得三角、若然一個麵包亦買五分、則每天只可買六個麵包、若以美國金洋算、一個麵包五分金洋合中國一角五分、則中國工人一天只可以買兩個麵包了、美國的煤每噸三元、中國的煤每噸十元、美國一輛汽車五百元、到中國要三千元、美國看一次電影五分錢、中國五角錢、最少亦要二角、而中國人的薪工、普通賺到三十元已很好、英國很小的位置每月亦可得一百元、不去算美金和國幣的滙兑率、美國人生活費和薪工的比例、假定是一、則中國人要十倍了、這實在是以十八世紀的收入、過二十世紀的耗費、如何不困難竭蹶、要提高中國人的收入去提高生活程度、是不合理的事情、我國根本没有多錢、况且層層相因、物價繼續騰貴、萬難達到歐美水平綫、我們反轉頭來、要减低物價、去適合於收入數目、依生活收入作比例、中國的煤、應該賣一元一噸、實際上山西的煤、很便宜的、最多不過二元一噸、惟因運費太貴和他種原因、故到漢口要賣十元、我們在運費方面大可以盡力去减低物價、國內運費實在太貴、譬如桐油一噸、從宜昌到漢口運費十二元、漢口到上海只要六元、路加一倍、而運費反廉一倍、上海到美國、則只美金三元、路加十倍、而費廉十倍、此種情形大可研究、我們要幚助抑低物價、而不抑低生活收益、扶助農村土産流通、抵抗幾萬萬元外貨入超的傾銷、這種抑低物價政策、不是英美的通貨澎漲政策、而求物產自足、採取印度不合作之自給自作政策、和日本振興工商業廉價製造政策、和我國歷代物賤則天下太平之政策、認定如此可以復興中國經濟、現在運費是很小的一部份、大部份還在生產和推銷機關、我們內航試騐這種政策、今天雖不能拿數目字證明成效、但一年來省內工商各方面活動的情形、確已使我們知道這條路不錯的、抑低物價和各方面的關係太複雜、軍事·政治·交通·金融·幣制·稅則·工商·都運鎖着、我不是經濟學者、更不知引用什麽學說、但可舉一件很明顯的事實作結論、西安以前煤價每噸三十元、現在隴海路通車後、每噸减至八元、於是新設了二家紗廠、紗廠决不能用三十元一噸的煤、這是我們經濟復興的要着」、</p>
<h3>粵省商業依然悲觀</h3>
<p>台山縣市面不設記賬</p>
<p>去年出入口貨均减少</p>
<p>廣州通信、粤省商業、入春以來、冷淡如故、廣州市商會附設之經濟設計會、為求解决復興今後市內商業起見、已函請市商會决定救濟方針、以便規劃進行、查市面衰落原因、根本在於民衆購買力弱、而購買力弱之故、則緣於年來對外貿易一落千丈、同時海外華僑匯解內地之欵减少、即以粤省台山縣面論、該縣出外僑民最衆、素稱富邑、詎自美洲禁金出口後、邑內活動資金、完全停止、去年台山商店倒閉者不知凡幾、今春該地交易、已改現欵制、不設記賬、月來且以記賬爲禁例、其商塲之凋敝、可窺一斑、聞商塲交易不許記賬條例、昨已由縣屬冲簍市永安圩兩商會頒發施行、其條例訂定、（一）凡本圩各商店、其門市零沾交易、應一律以現銀交易為標凖、不得徇情賒欠、以維血本、（二）凡門市零沾與批發、應一律以現金交易為原則、但對於圩中各店交易、如出入憑簿取貨者、每月結算一次、以資流通、（三）對於各行商店、如有不遵條例者、一經查出、從嚴處罰、（四）本條例自民國二十四年夏曆正月初八日起施行、按粤省商塲慣例、向賴信用賒借、往往以現金一萬元、而經營十萬元商業者、今新例頒行、資金不能活用、以言守成則可、若云發展則未可必也、</p>
<p>至全省對外貿易、去年出入口貨均减縮、而入超則達七千八百餘萬元、據統計局調查、由民國十九年至二十三年、粤省洋貨入口與土貨出片、總值比較如次、（一）民國十九年、洋貨進口二萬五千零七十五萬三百七十七元、土貨出口一萬六千四百六十五萬三千六百七十六元、是年入超八千六百零九萬六千七百零一元、（二）二十年、洋貨進口二萬五千五百二十六萬二千二百八十四元、土貨出口一萬五千二百零三萬四千七百二十一元、入超一萬零三百二十二萬七千五百六十三元、（三）二十一年、洋貨進口三萬一千四百二十五萬八千零五十四元、土貨出口九千三百五十三萬八千二百零五元、入超二萬二千一百七十二萬零八百四十九元、（四）二十二年、洋貨進口二萬六千九百二十二萬元、土貨出口九千四百四十萬零三百五十四元、入超一萬七千四百七十六萬一千六百四十六元、（五）二十三年、洋貨進口一萬五千六百五十五萬三千一百二十三元、土貨出口七千八百二十五萬二千六百七十四元、入超七千八百三十萬零四百四十九元、以上五年俱呈入超現象、而入超之數、五年合計、共達六萬六千四百十萬零七千二百零八元、就上列數字而言、以二十一年洋貨輸進最多、同時土貨出口亦少、去年（二十三年）入超最少、表面上似可樂觀、然按諸實際、由於粤民購買力鋭减、社會經濟枯竭之反映耳、</p>

<h3>銀錢兩業恢復收受地産抵押</h3>
<p>地價已見起色金融漸趨安定</p>
<p>减少信用放欵儘量貨物抵欵</p>
<p>新聲社云、地方協會·市商會等團體集議救濟市面後、銀錢兩業、對於地産押欵、已恢復承做、金融漸趨安定、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>地産抵押恢復承做</p>
<p>從前習慣、銀錢業受抵地産押欵、爲唯一穩健之營業、蓋以其産屬不動、價值穩定、中外銀行、皆樂於受抵、自去年起、因銀根緊急、地産價格狂跌後、於是銀錢業一律拒絶、萬一受抵、則限制甚嚴、以致地産呆滯、自地方恊會等團體集議救濟後、銀錢業對於地産抵押、地已恢復承做、惟視自身之力量而起、故今之地産、較前稍已活動、而其價格、亦見起色、</p>
<p>貨物押欵儘量收受</p>
<p>民國二十三年總結賬後、錢業市塲、每日公佈之洋拆、恒在八九分、而每年習慣、在總結賬後、錢業開始送摺放欵之際、恒在白拆、故滬市銀根雖較去年爲鬆、但仍未完全恢復、銀錢兩業、對於信用放欵、均甚鄭重、堆貨物抵押放欵、則儘量收受、以資達到復興目的、故滬市金融業已漸趨安定、大致經過相當時期、即可完全恢復云、</p>

<h3>華英藥房債權人會昨已議决復業</h3>
<p>當塲推出代表十二人</p>
<p>查核賬目並討論辦法</p>
<p>南京路華英藥房、因經濟週轉不靈、經股東會决議、總分號自本月一日起、均暫停營業、并委請謝霖會計師通告淸算、謝氏當通知各債權人、於昨日下午二時、假座福州路大雅樓菜館、召集會議、到二百餘人、代表債權共九十萬元、首由謝氏報告開會宗旨、及人欠欠人賬略後、各債權人十二人、查核賬目、並商討辦法、茲將詳情分誌如後、</p>
<p>報告賬略</p>
<p>謝氏報告賬略、計負債項下股本十萬元、抵押借入五萬元、存入保證金三萬一千餘元、未付貨欵十六萬一千餘元、欠各銀行錢莊十七萬九千餘元、存入欵項七十八萬三千餘元、計資產項下存貨六十二萬三千餘元、房地產廿一萬二千餘元、生財四萬餘元、存出保證金四萬餘元、客戶欠欵十七萬五千餘元、暫詔欠欵八萬三千餘元、分公司欠四萬九千餘元、虧耗四萬五千餘元、共計一百卅三萬八千餘元、</p>
<p>股東决議</p>
<p>謝氏繼謂、就上述之資産負債情形、可見存貨過多、外欠難收、以致現金週轉不靈、而市面之不景氣、亦為重要原因、該公司股東開會討論、恐市面不振、存欵有出無進、無論法律事實、祗有解散淸算、庶免增加損失、否則訴訟疊起、尤恐有失平衡、故於二月二＋八日股東會中决議解散清算、選任謝會計師爲淸算人、俾資依法結束云、</p>

<p>議决復業</p>

<h3>兩湖功夫茶美商函請改良</h3>
<p>錦隆洋行致漢市商品檢騐局函</p>
<p>本埠錦隆洋行、前曾致函漢口市商品檢騐局請改良兩湖功夫茶、茲將原函譯錄如下、逕啟者、近接溫斯丹君在美國調查美國對華茶葉意見報告書、其中頗有為貴局所願知者、爰特摘要轉達、</p>
<p>茶箱</p>
<p>中國茶箱質料太弱、運往美國、路途遙遠、不能耐久、時有損壞、此種輿論、迭有所聞、經該國茶商研究後、咸謂、若以三夾板製之錫蘭箱裝運、始無慮、但改裝錫蘭箱後、美國亦未必能出較高價格購買、惟對於推銷、確容易多矣、</p>
<p>競爭</p>
<p>日本及台灣茶之競爭、日見劇烈、其最大優點、即其茶箱之堅固、遠非中國功夫茶所及、現在又因製茶整潔良好、故已得美國政府特許、得照爪哇標凖茶辦法辦理、即可以用爲攙和橙黄白毫（Orange　Pekol）及白毫（Pekol）之用、（譯者按橙黄白毫·白毫·皆爲歐美紅茶之種類名、若能攙入、銷路便可大增、）但中國茶則按照中國功夫茶標凖辦理、不能攙入橙黄白毫及白毫茶中發售、如欲攙入、必須在標記上特别註明、固然在最近的將來日本及台灣之紅茶、將另訂標凖、但禁止中國茶用作攙混之命令、則恐未能撤銷也、有數家美國大茶商、曾謂、就價格上言、兩湖功夫茶、常比日本或台灣紅茶爲廉、但因上述禁令之限制、故不能用功夫茶為其牌子攙併之用、實為憾事、下述乃美國茶商向温斯丹君發表之意見、（甲）謂個人意見、頗嗜功夫茶、但為營業起見、須辦日本紅茶、蓋日茶之葉子、較為整潔良好、而適合市塲胃口也、（乙）謂所辦功夫茶為數頗少、蓋在市塲上日本及台灣茶競爭頗烈、而日本茶之爭競尤為劇烈、（丙）謂個人意見、頗嗜功夫茶、但既為攙併茶商、遂不能購置功夫茶、蓋因有上述限制之命令也、（丁）（係一極大茶商、同時亦為美國茶業公會委員之一、）謂標凖功夫茶之營業頗小、蓋不能與日本及台灣相競爭也、以上四種意見、可以代表美國全國茶商之意見、敝行更綜合之如下、（一）標凖功夫茶之葉子、必須採選較優、方可與日茶競爭、（二）在美國推銷珍貴紅茶之希望極少、美國所需要者、乃最廉價之茶耳、但茶價雖廉、品質却不可太次、須合乎政府所訂標凖功夫之樣子、故須注意葉之整潔、價格須與日茶相仿、（三）茶箱必須改良、中國茶箱之最劣者、莫如湘潭、為堅固起見、似可于箱內四角頗拐條四條、（四）一切茶箱、在鉛壳（錫壳）與茶葉之間、必須襯以洋紙、以免茶鉛接觸、（此乃美國政府之規律、必須遵從、）以上云云、對于貴國茶業、加有關係、素聞貴局努力于中國製茶之改善、爰供所見、以備採納、</p>
<h3>台州會館火井請派專家研究</h3>
<p>鄒技正調查所得</p>
<p>各方面意見發表</p>
<p>本市滬南盧家灣新橋路台州會館內發現之火井、前經市社會局派員調查各情、已誌前報、中央社記者以此事對於工業上、頗多關係、特向本市公用局方面探悉、該局業經派由技正鄒恩泳前往調查、并將調查所得情形、由該局函請中央研究院工業試業所、中華化學工業會等、推派專家來局、會同作進一步之研究、茲將鄒技正調查所得情形、分誌於後、</p>
<p>火井情形</p>
<p>該火井係在滬南區新橋路台州會館鼎豐肥皂廠內、井址在昔係一水井、後忽乾涸、雖經塡没但因屢次下陷、乃塡以煤屑、嗣忽發熱、火焰由井管洩出、源源不絶、惟井口二尺周圍內、亦有零星氣質噴出、現該肥皂廠在井之周圍、砌有磚牆、墩上置大鍋一隻、滿儲以水、利用此火煮熱、晚間將火撲滅、次晨再行燃着、此火井發現以來、已有一年以上、井中氣體、終日噴發、似無若何增减、</p>
<p>氣體試騐</p>
<p>此項氣體、由該局托由工業試騐所、詳加試騐結果、詳開下列表中、爲供參考起見、另行列羅國瑞發明之天然瓦斯、及上海自來火公司煤氣二項氣體之品質於表內、</p>
<p>氣量測量</p>
<p>該火井之氣量、經托上海自來火公司代爲測量、結果如下、（一）氣壓力頗有上落、約計等於八分之五英寸之水柱高度、（二）以井管二吋直徑估計、氣量約等於每小時一千立方英尺、（三）氣體漏洩頗多、依此計算、則每晝夜可出氣二萬四千立方英尺、如杜絶漏洩、則氣量當不止此、</p>
<p>各方意見</p>
<p>自該井發現後、經各方調查、均有意見發表、探錄如下、（一）工業試騐所所長沈熊慶之意見、以為產量不甚多、日久當自熄滅、（二）上海自來火公司孟恩君意見、甲、此氣體之源、是否充足、乃一問題、一旦熄滅、實屬可能、如欲投資設法利用、頗爲危險、乙、鼎豐肥皂廠如能稍加設備、則火力當可增大、譬如依照班生燈原則、在管口以下、某點鑽成一洞、俾空氣先與此氣混合、然後燃燒、較之氣已噴出管口、如與空氣混合、必能得到充分養化、而火力更大矣、目前該處之鐵鍋、底外面黑烟集聚甚厚、職是之故、丙、井周圍氣體漏洩、不止一處、如能建造圍牆及頂蓋、將氣量圈集一處、則氣量當可增加、惟氣體如果因此周圍以外流入者、則恐此圍牆反將氣源割斷、丁、如用唧機抽出氣體、頗恐空氣、或其他雜氣、亦被抽吸在內云、</p>

<h3>劉徵如遺妾訴親子東寶案續審</h3>
<p>東寳竟否認有此生母</p>
<p>劉妾泣請葉山濤作證</p>
<p>南潯富户劉徵如（又名澄緒澄如）、身故多年、生前廣置姬妾、以故子女蕃庶、共有男女十八口之衆、遺産則有二千萬、其第九子東寳、爲第四妾嚴玉英所出、今已二十餘歳、嚴氏於民元由劉納爲　室、翌年三月二十三日産東寳、惟夫婦虐待日甚、致使嚴氏萬難相忍、遂於是年冬被廹脱離劉氏家庭、迄今二十餘載、飄泊無依、現其因所生之子、業已成年、自應</p>
<p>贍養老母</p>
<p>乃與東寳交涉、詎東寳竟否認係嚴氏所生、該氏祗得延律師章士釗彭淵恂向第一特區地方法院提起確認之訴、曾誌前報、日前又由余長資推事開庭續審、被告不到、延律師提出昔年嚴氏簽之脱離據及前嘗涉訟之法庭和解筆錄、謂此兩據內均未</p>
<p>提及東寳</p>
<p>係原告親生子、且和解時、曾給原告八千元、今其又復起訴、實有一案兩控之嫌、與訴訟程序相背、要求予以駁回云云、當由原告嚴玉英訴稱、民元嫁與劉徵如爲妾、翌年三月産生東寳、平日大婦、異常虐待、此際益甚、凡購與東寳所飲牛乳、彼必設法取去、種種陰毒手段、不勝枚舉、是年六月、</p>
<p>我又懷孕</p>
<p>但至八月、實屬不堪凌虐、始從青島與劉辭别、獨往天津、劉旋挽葉山濤北上、將我於十一月初七日勸回上海、惟既不容於大婦、被拒絶進宅、而劉復不允另營居處、祗得曲徇葉山濤之勸、簽訂離異字據、當時葉且言劉之年事已高、他日謝世後、東寳當然仍認我爲生母、故於該據內未載明東寳係我親生、而劉家並因我</p>
<p>即須下堂</p>
<p>以我腹中一塊肉、尚未至瓜熟蒂落之期、則設法覔得墮胎老嫗、廹我將胎墮下、始得脱身、我之嫁劉爲妾、原由葉山濤説合、而脱離關係、亦由葉居間、劉雖逝世、葉猶健在、儘可請求傳其到案作證云云、言時淚如珠落、悲傷不已、嗣由兩造律師就程序一點、先行辯論終結、官諭候定期宣判</p>

<h3>特載中日經濟提携之商榷</h3>
<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>最近日本各報，盛傳中日經濟提携，我們以爲中日過去關係如此其惡，遽言提携，未免離事實尚遠。雖然調整，乃提携的先聲，但我們總覺得以現在的中日關係，與其説是提携，不若説是調整，較爲適切。</p>
<p>所謂中日經濟調整，據二月十四日日本外交部舉行對華經濟調整討論會討論的結果爲：</p>
<p>（一）爲使中日兩國的經濟團體和實業家等，感珜更能融洽起見，奬勵派遣赴華經濟考察團，但此事須與民間關係者，恊議後施行。</p>
<p>（二）爲使中國經濟財政都能徹底改造達到自力更生起見，日本有實行下列幾種對華援助之意。</p>
<p>（甲）中國爲農業國，竟由海外輸入米，小麥及其他食糧品，這是最不自然的現象，日本願在農業方面，給中國以經濟的及技術的援助。</p>
<p>（乙）棉花等爲日本必向外國等輸入的工業原料，奬勵中國大量生産，完成中日經濟調整的基礎條件，同時圖謀增加中國農民的購買力。</p>
<p>（丙）爲使中國的産業，實現合理的經營起見，必要時，日本願給中國以經濟的及技術的援助。</p>
<p>（丁）中日的貿易關係，實行比率輸入制（Quota　System），藉以增加兩國商品的輸入。</p>
<p>（三）中國白銀的流出問題，外交部曾與財政部和正金銀行當局恊議，希望國際能得成立新恊定，藉以緩和美國的買銀政策及一九三三年的國際銀恊定，但具體對策，還未研究，外國銀行因爲特殊關係，以上海爲中心，輸銀出口，影響甚大，日本希望中國改善幣制，整理和統一銀行鈔票，以期挽回危局。</p>
<p>（四）日本政府願在上海設立一特殊銀行，資金約二億日圓，藉以救濟中國金融與産業界的窮困。這二億圓的信用機關，既可使中日貿易關係的金融周轉靈活，而兩國當更蒙極大利益，尤其中國，關税收入，可由此增加，其他政策又得順利改良。</p>
<p>（五）但是這裏有一個絶對必要的條件，就是要求中國嚴厲取締排日，尤其是徹底取締排日教育，須知排斥價廉物美的日貨，是妨碍中國經濟復興的最大原因。</p>
<p>（六）對於關税，尤須中國反省，此後不僅不再提高，而且要對日特别减低。</p>
<p>這是日本官方的意見，至於經濟界如東京大阪兩工商會以及其他各經濟團體，都有對華經濟提携的討論與表示，大致與上述日外部的綱領大同小異，此處不再詳爲引證。惟值得我們注意的，就是日本在這時期，爲什麽要高唱中日經濟提携？我們可以將（一）近一二年來日貨到處受人排擠，（二）中國市塲與日本經濟關係的重要性，二點來説明之。</p>
<p>日本整個經濟的生存，完全建築在輸出貿易之上，要是各國排擠日貨，而中國市塲又不能爲日本任意運用，則日本的經濟自將陷入於崩潰之途。然而所謂經濟國家主義，幾爲全世界的國家所奉行，日貨在這經濟國家主義的盛行之際，遂無活動之餘地。各國排擠日貨的手段，或採取提高關税，管理滙兑，或限制輸入，或輸入比率制，甚或有嚴厲禁止日貨輸入，徵收日貨的傾銷税等等方法，藉以阻止日貨而保護目國産業的發展。兹將各國排擠日貨的情形略述如次：</p>
<p>英國：提高關税，以阻止其輸入。</p>
<p>法國：施以高税率外，并徵匯兑税，以使日商人無利可得；對幾項重要商品如鐵磁器，木材，水産品等，則實行輸入比率制，務使日貨不能自由運入法境。</p>
<p>徳國：大概與法同。</p>
<p>意大利：提高關税率和管理滙兑，務使日貨入意，不能有厚利可圖。</p>
<p>比利時：施行輸入比率制。</p>
<p>瑞士：實行輸入比率制，並封幾項商品如樹膠鞋，棉織物等，非經政府許可，不得輸入。</p>
<p>荷蘭：瑞士相同。</p>
<p>奥國：實行提高關税，管理滙兑，并决定日貨非經許可不得輸入。</p>
<p>匈牙利：與奥國相同。</p>
<p>捷克斯拉夫：管理匯兑外，并日貨未經許可不得輸入。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞：對一百三十種商品實行統制輸入，并管理滙兑。</p>
<p>波蘭：施行輸入比率制。</p>
<p>西班牙：施行輸入比率制外，並管理匯兑。</p>
<p>希臘：施行輸入比率制，管理滙兑，并擇對自己有利的貨物與日貨交換。</p>
<p>土耳其：施行輸入比率制與管理匯兑。</p>
<p>英屬印度：除提高關税外，并頒布産業保護法，廢棄日印通商恊約，與英國訂立互惠條約以抵制日貨。</p>
<p>馬來羣島：提高關税，并與英國成立特殊關係，藉以限制日貨之輸入。</p>
<p>荷屬印度：對一般商品提高關税，對米，大豆等，則禁止輸入，對水門汀，棉布等，則實行輸入比率制，并發非常時的限制輸入令。</p>
<p>菲律賓：提高關税及廢止從量税。</p>
<p>暹羅：提高關税。</p>
<p>美國：提高關税外，并對日貨徵收傾銷税，對於日本酒！啤酒等，則禁止其輸入。</p>
<p>加拿大：提高關税，並施行滙兑附加税。</p>
<p>巴西：提高關税并管理匯兑。</p>
<p>阿根廷：管理滙兑。</p>
<p>智利：關税一律提高百分之五十，并管理滙兑。</p>
<p>埃及：提高關税。</p>
<p>南菲聯邦：提高關税外，并徵收傾銷税。</p>
<p>東菲洲：提高關税。</p>
<p>英屬菲洲：宣告脱離日英通商條約。</p>
<p>澳州：管理滙兑并徵收匯兑附加税。</p>
<p>厄瓜多爾：禁止日本生絲，棉布等入口。</p>
<p>世界各地這樣普遍地排擠日貨，并不是因爲日本强占我東北四省，退出國聯，而主持公道，乃是各國不能與低工資，低匯兑，而成本較輕的日貨競爭，各國爲保護自己的産業，不得不排擠日貨，乃極自然的結果。（未完）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （汪嘯麟）</p>
<p>有人喜歡吃排骨湯麵·還有人愛吃牛肉絲炒飯，我却好吃「閉門羮」。此羮，雖然冷得可憐，却也冷得爽快。比諸「座上吃冷飯」，「門下喝熱湯」，終要差勝一籌吧。</p>
<p>慳吝的人們，在戀愛的塲合，會把捨不得的金錢，很悲哀的或者居然很慷慨的拿出來。這種事實，在我們四週俯拾即是。看來，「戀愛」倒是「慳吝」的對症妙藥。要如站在經濟學的立塲講話，「戀愛」應是「金錢」的仇敵。</p>
<p>新八股文有幾句話這樣説：「過去的就讓他過去，未來的也不必去憧憬。現實活躍在我們眼前，把握這個現實吧！」究竟，什麽是現實？怎樣去抓着這個現實？「今日有酒今日醉」，「做日和尚撞日鐘」。這，是否即所謂把握現實？</p>
<h3>三月三的薺菜歌</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>「三月三日天氣新，長安道上多麗人。……」這唐人的詩句，所紀竟像現行的國歷一般，妙！查三月三日舊是上已佳節，正值春情蕩漾的時期，推究生理作用的常態，自不免有女懷春，所以道路上多見麗人了！誰説我國舊詩人的作品不科學化呢？</p>
<p>記得有一篇民歌，也是描摹這個時序中女兒們的心曲和情態的兼帶着刻劃陋俗，又透切又風趣；這裏錄出全篇，隨帶一番解釋。</p>
<p>「三月三，薺菜開花結牡丹。牡丹姐，要嫁人。石榴姐，做媒人。媒人到，鬼商量。轎子到，哭爺娘。長手巾，短手巾，揩揩眼淚便抽身！」</p>
<p>薺菜是借物件點明時令，並象徵一班鄉下姑娘。鄉諺説：「毛頭姑娘十八變」；薺菜開花可結牡丹，比喻鄉下姑娘在青春發育時期，似花蕊初開，會變成絶色的。三月三的時光，簫鼓家家，正是嫁人的天氣；牡丹姐性與人同，自憐玉貌，自然要嫁人了。石榴姐，在生理上尚未及時，但也同被惱人的春色所蠱惑，便存「行得春風有夏雨」之念，像養媳婦那麽的攬做媒人了。做媒人的，自有十惡不赦的過節兒還變本加厲；做新娘的，也有諸多虚僞的解數兒要仿假逼真。可是，女兒家在人情上不免的，離親時悲愴的情懷，已變成被俗禮所强廹的，上轎時哭泣的節奏；這種名色上爲爺娘揮灑的涕淚，也祇是虚應故事，很少出於悲痛的了！長長短短的手巾揩了揩眼淚便抽身，可見伊性急慌忙，這纔是真情流露咧！</p>
<p>這歌的作法很有古風的氣息，唱來特别的順口好聽，也是值得稱美的。</p>
<h3>萬人坑</h3>
<p>— 胡沉舟</p>
<p>「喏，這個便是萬人坑！」</p>
<p>循着舟子所指的方向望過去，我看見一個跟土堡差不離的建築物，上面長着無數的青苔和野藤。這些蔓生植物却遮不了它的斷壁，殘垣，那好像戰爭的剩餘或者遺跡。正面中央有一個大口子，似乎深到不能測量它的深度。它孤獨地矗立在薄暮的原野裏，四周有崎嶇的地面和萋萋的蔓草綿長地伸到渺茫的遠處。</p>
<p>望着，望着，依然没有意會那老船夫的古怪的名詞，我不暇再加以思索，就問他：「你説什麽萬人坑？萬人坑是什麽呀？」</p>
<p>「萬人坑？」他停止摇櫓，開始微笑着。顯然他是因爲自己熟悉故典而自矜了。「你先生不是這兒人？自然不會知道。但是，呵，我告訴你吧！那是一個坑，一個去死人的坑！」</p>
<p>「一個堆死人的坑，你説？」我不禁喊了起來。</p>
<p>「唔，堆死人的坑。那裏面堆着孩屍，成千成萬的孩屍。你知道，窮人家死了孩子，没有錢買棺材，便用一個爛蒲包或者一塊破布，裹了孩屍，提到這兒來，往那口子裏一民摔就完事了。」</p>
<p>我有點驚奇。可是那舟子叙述着這件事以那種漠不關心的神情，立刻説服了我。問題敲着我的脣門重又回到喉嚨裏去了！我呆呆地盯着恐怖的死亡的貯藏所，想像着它裏面的景象：那裏面一定有着特别的氣息，一定蠕蠕地爬着不可計算的微菌。那裏的屍體有的該早變成骷髏了，有的該已腐爛，有的該正在腐爛，經過了雨打，日曬，風化！……</p>
<p>突然想起那些躺在上海公墓裏的白色大理石下的一兩歳甚至於祇有一兩個月的孩子們。它們的墓石上精緻地裝飾着白色大理石的和平女神，白色大理石的刻着死者的生卒期的碑和大圓玻璃罩裏的花，我迷惘了！</p>
<h3>到農村去</h3>
<h3>世界名酒考（下）</h3>
<p>— 召予</p>
<p>人類與酒之關係　北方民族，喜飲强烈性之酒，熱帶民族，喜飲甜而平和之酒，蒙古人在嚴寒中，喜飲含有少量酒精之乳酒，此就民族性與氣候方面言之也。乳酒爲畜牧時代之副産物，穀酒爲農業時代之副産物，葡萄酒原始於人類野性時代，（此非筆者有意取笑，在歐洲人亦有此神話説：當時因彷徨山野，採木實草實而充飢，有半人半獸之酒神教之釀酒之法。）此就酒之誕生時代言之也。中國人以米，麥，高粱釀酒，俄國人以蕾麥，大麥，裸麥，玉蜀黍釀酒，印度人用椰子，墨西哥人用龍舌蘭，此就原料受天然之支配言之也。寒帶人説酒可戰勝寒氣，熱帶人説酒可征服酷熱，此就民族對於酒之觀念言之也。酒之顔色亦隨各地民族性而異，大抵進化年數較短之民族，喜深色，强色，反之則喜淡色，淺色，所以觀其性之所好，即可知其爲何種民族也。</p>
<h3>歩入了鬼門</h3>
<p>— （笑笑）</p>
<p>有人説：</p>
<p>失却了「戀」好似摘去了心。</p>
<p>失却了「愛」好似勾去了魂。</p>
<p>青年們的口頭語：「戀愛可以灌溉青春」</p>
<p>那麽；失却了戀愛豈不是：「歩入了鬼門！」</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>大理印象記</h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>大理之名。很少人知道的，但提起了「大理石」三個字，却又是盡人皆知。這個大理就是産大理石的地方，在雲南之西北部，是唐代南詔國和宋代大理國的國都；氣候温和，四季如春，境內多山，風景絶佳！風，花，雪，月的四景都極著名，那就是上關的花，下關的風，蒼山的雪，洱海的月。</p>
<p>大理城西行五十里，有點蒼山，又名靈鷲山，傳説觀世音菩薩修道的地方，山脈起自崑崙山南支，有十九峯，最高的達一萬四千尺，疊嶂層巒，綿延一百餘里，雍渾偉大，樹木林立，蒼翠可愛。平常的山「日出而林霏開」；此山則不然，祗在淸早開爽一會，太陽東升的時候，全山就被雲霧遮蔽着。獨七八月，則全日都無雲，祗在山腰間横亙着好像一條白帶般的白雲，名曰「玉帶雲」，這就是所謂「玉帶鎖蒼山」的勝景。這些情形，都是親目所覩。真是奇景呀！此外又有很多飛泉，懸崖千丈，傾瀉而下，聲如洪鐘，震人耳鼓。</p>
<p>還有更趣的，就是山中有很多冰淇淋發賣。最初我以爲在這山僻小縣也有造冰廠；可是問問土人都不識怎樣的造冰廠，再深究他們的冰是從何而來的，才知道冬季取自蒼山之頂，藏於陰濕石岩中，炎夏取出，和以蔗糖以供飲料。按蒼山菊後積雪，初夏始消，其蹟雪之時間這樣久，所以土人藏下來發賣的雪很多，而價也便宜。</p>
<p>城東有個廣二十里至三十里長九十里形如耳朶的淡水湖，據土人説是古時的葉榆澤。因它形如耳朶，故又呌它洱海，魚蝦之利頗大，而尤有功於農田之灌溉。內有三島，四洲，九曲，都是很可建設田園	廬舍的地方。城南三十里洱水下趨之處，有一石橋，叫做「天橋」，幽壑深藏，石橋跨於左右，好像一個人家；憑空無依，祗渡一人，形勢危絶！余過此橋時，驚心動魄，屢欲折回·！過了橋，西行百餘歩，有一石岩，前當急流之處，浪花四濺，有如梅花瓣瓣；這橋又叫做「不謝梅橋」，恐怕就是從這樣得來的。到了晚間皓月東升時，波光㶑灔，漁舟摇曳，更覺有趣。這是我到洱那天的夜景，不知所謂「洱海月」的，就是這樣的景緻否？</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>賈多才輕輕的向他笑道？承張兄的美意願和我們做説客，這野馬就不必跑得太遠了。張介夫笑道：那也好，我想這位大嫂，是過了分的老實人，不用和他吞吞吐吐的説，三言兩語都告訴他，讓他作主好了。於是起身兩歩，走到胡氏面前，俯身向他道：這位賈老爺，早有意要收你姑娘作二房，你是知道的了。你打算要多少錢，才肯答應呢？胡氏和他婆婆，以及他娘家人胡嫂子，誰不是指望在月英身上生出一筆錢財，來解救大家的困難的。至於能要多少錢，他們實在没有標凖。胡氏的意思，兩代寡婦，跟着這位姑娘，能過一輩子，也就行了。手上多少有幾個錢，能活動活動，自然是好。就是没有錢，有了這樣一個開銀子店的姑爺，還用得愁着什麽呀？再説開大了口，怕人家不肯，開少了口，又怕上了當。張介夫向他提出了這麽一個問題，猛然間，那裏答得出來，口裏喳喳了一陣，最後算是逼出兩句話來，他笑道：賈老爺是個活財神，還能少給呀？我又不會説話，呌我説什麽呢？張介夫回頭道：賈兄，你的意思怎麽樣？賈多才向他丢了一個眼色，向屋子外定，張介夫也就跟了出去。約有十幾分鐘，只張介夫一個人進來，牽了一牽胡氏的衣袖，讓他站起，然後同背了月英，靠了墻。他低聲道：大嫂子，你看見桌上那些洋錢嗎？你若是心裏一活動，那些洋錢，馬上就是你的了。這又是一件胡氏耳朶裏的曠古奇聞，竟會有這樣的怪事，他心慌了，呌他答應什麽是好呢？他疑心這是作夢呀。（一四七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>就説我自己吧，去的時候，當然也是極高興的，總道是這次的旅行必有極佳的收穫，那裏知道只見到了許多很古怪的角燈，和聞到了幾日夜的足以令人致病的紫丁香花的臭味，怎不教人失望得豪興盡消。</p>
<p>突然，李蓮英從他自己的車上匆匆地走到了太后的車上來。</p>
<p>「啟禀老佛爺！再不消幾分鐘的工夫，車子就要到天津了！」他叩過頭，低聲啟奏着。臉上照例的堆着一臉諂媚無恥的奸笑。「那裏似乎總得稍停一會，讓那些大臣們行一個最簡短的禮。」</p>
<p>太后今天偏不聽他的話，立即非常乾脆的答道：</p>
<p>「車子是無論如何不准停下來的！祇有來一個折中的辦法；便是當我們的車子進了站之後，你先給我留心看着，到得最廹近的所在，你再來回報我！」</p>
<p>不多一會，天津的輪廓已漸漸地顯露出來了；太后因爲已知道袁世凱所率領的一班官員不久就要在月台上跪着看我們經過了，便加意的凖備起來。一面把伊自己的衣服整理着，一面還教我們不要亂動，站得分外的端整些。而同時那司機人也已得到了暗示，忙把車行的速率减低了許多。其實以太后之尊，像這樣特地教車子减低了速率來接受他們的敬禮，已可算是非常的優待了：不過太后對於袁世凱確然特别的重視，伊認爲單是使車行稍緩，尚不足以酬答他的厚意，於是便有了更進一歩的表示。（二五八）</p>

<h3>猶太頑强優游苦戰而勝</h3>
<p>結果爲三對二</p>
<p>局勢極爲緊張</p>
<p>優游與猶太於昨日午後三時、在申園足球塲交鋒、作西聯足球甲組賽之一幕、交綏之下、猶太人人拚命、竟能造成相持之局面、競爭頗烈、上半時優游以二比一佔先、結果爲三比二、優游勝</p>
<p>優游迎頭痛擊</p>
<p>優游開球、先發制人、猶太憑其勇猛之天性、努力抵抗、進進退退、風險靡定、混戰達五分鐘、羅海光帶球深入、陳士凱猛力施射、恰中要害、移時鍾勇森邊陲傳中、孫錦順一射而中、惜因越位、不作計算、優游聲勢、並不因此而餒、鍾勇森邊陲起義、帶球入腹地、猶太兩內衛挺胸救球、致種下禍根、被罰十二碼、孫鐵腿馬到成功、净勝二球、</p>
<p>猶太扳回一球</p>
<p>猶太連失兩球後、全軍憤懣塡胸、乃大興問罪之師、龐却克得左右內鋒之策應、奪回一球、入後孫錦順曾有二次絶佳之攻門機會、均被猶太守門妙救出險、殊爲可惜、未幾上半時告終、優游乃以二對一佔先、</p>
<p>各二戰成和局</p>
<p>再戰聲中、猶太本其百折不撓之精神、亡命反攻、優游腹地、一時風雨飄颻、幸賴兩內衛合力捍禦、得免於難、猶太屢攻不入、右內衛哈雪克、動作方面乃有失檢之處、被罰出塲、從此猶太乃以十人迎戰、反攻之勢、益爲劇烈、透脱曼與龐却克雙騎並進、王樹森江善敬拒之不得、被S格林勃怒射一記、因近咫尺、守門張榮才無法施救、遂造成各二之平局、</p>
<p>優游高奏凱歌</p>
<p>平局既成、雙方攻勢益爲緊張、孫錦順畢竟不凡、單騎直入、至相當地位、平地一脚、球出如矢、猶太守門、措手不及、此球踢來極爲淸晰、嘆爲觀止、四座觀衆、歡呼若狂、猶太至此、動作方面益爲粗暴、S格林勃態度傲慢、對裁判員口出汚言、立刻被罰下塲、輾轉良久、時間告畢、優游遂以三對二勝猶太、</p>

<h3>二十三年國內各地疾病概况及防疫設施情形</h3>
<p>— 申報年鑑社</p>
<p>（甲）鼠疫……本年鼠疫，全國僅福建一省，接有報告；惟爲數不多，計在蘇溪頭發現者十六人，龍岩城附近之鐵石陽村發現者，十一人，及至十一月，該省雖又有鼠疫消息報告，惟結果因未得細菌學者之檢騐與證明，確否尚無從得悉。</p>
<p>（乙）霍亂……本年全國各地霍亂，極少發現，計曾經檢騐証明者，僅有六人，第一人於六月九日發見於廣州，七月四日，有二人見於漢口，其餘三人，於七月十九日及二十八日發見於上海，且均属慢性，不久即送治痊愈，此外可疑之霍亂患者散見於長江上遊腹地各市鎭及青島等地。各大城市仍如往年舉行大規模之預防接種工作，上海方面，則由上海市政府租界衛生當局及鐵路衛生處等機關通力恊作，舉行預防接種，截至八月底止，共計受接種者七十四萬九千六百二十五人，同時自來水公司，亦施捨飲水於窮苦階級，並由衛生當局，派員至各水井所在地，舉行消毒工作。</p>
<p>（丙）黑熱病……黑熱病在中國，根據過去調查報告，幾常發現於山東河北之全部，山西之大部，及河南陝西之東部，與江蘇安徽之北部。本年六月間全國經濟委員會衛生實騐處，為研討黑熱病治療及預防方法起見，曾在江蘇淸江浦設立黑熱病研究隊，從事研究。據報告：該隊自八月至十二月間，曾以極精密之方法，在十個村莊內，施行調查，計九百八十二人中，患黑熱病者達二百四十二人，佔總人口百分之二十四，該隊並在該地設立醫院及診療所，截至本年底止，計住院病人有二百另一人，門診新病人六百九十一人。</p>
<p>（丁）麻瘋病……年來國人對於麻瘋病人，已漸引起注意，自本年內，政府及私人團體創設痳瘋院及麻瘋診療所之踴躍情形觀之，即可證明。其中中國麻瘋協會以十萬元鉅欵，在上海吳淞建築麻瘋病院一事，尤惹人注意。據可靠估計，全世界患麻瘋病者共計三百萬人，中國占三分之一—百萬；而目前中國麻瘋機關，據記者所知，僅有麻瘋病院二十三處，診療所十七處，麻瘋村九處，前往受治者，約計僅五千人左右，是則我國麻瘋問題之急待解决，實為刻不容緩之舉。</p>
<p>（戊）肺癆……吾國過去肺癆病情形如何，迄今尚未見有詳細統計，故真實情形如何，無從得悉。惟據香港，北平及上海三處調查結果，得知國人立患肺癆者為數不少。上海中國防癆恊會，成立於民國二十二年，對于肺癆患者，現正在繼續調查之中，並於該病之重要性，廣為宣傳，以引起國人之注意。不久以前，該會曾在上海舉行大會一次，薈萃全國專家於一堂，共同研討有關肺癆之各項問題，結果頗佳。北平方面，對于肺癆預防工作，近來亦有長足之進展，計現有肺癆機關八處，病床二百九十六張，在民國十八年時，是項機關，僅有兩處，床位五張。此外北平市癆病醫院，目下亦正在籌劃建設中。其主旨在訓練防癆專門人員，組織包括療養醫院及癆病公共衛生研究所各一處。</p>
<p>（己）天花及白喉……天花之防治，其重要性已爲一般人所公認，故現在各地衛生行政機關，每年均重視種痘工作，在二十二年七月至二十三年六月一期間中，僅上海市衛生局所舉行之預防天花種痘工作，接種人數，已達二十四萬六千零六十三人之多。國人對於天花之注意，即此可見一斑，至於白喉，北平及南京等市衛生當局，本年亦曾舉行大規模預防運動，據統計，預防接種人數，北平為四千九百零五人，南京為九千另三十八人。</p>
<p>（庚）赤痢瘧疾及脚氣病……此三種病，據衛生實騐處於本年十一，十二月在南昌·臨川·南鄭·南豐·廣昌·白水·驛前·豐城·常熟·吉安及太和等處病院調查，均甚劇烈。計住院病人中，患赤痢者，約占百分之五十，瘧疾及脚氣病約占百分之二十五。</p>
<p>（辛）郱蟲病……關於防治郱蟲病工作，浙江省政府已與衛生實騐處共同從事研究，並在衢縣及杭州設立防治日本住血吸蟲病工作隊各一處，從事於釘螺絲生活史之研究及治療病人工作，據研究報告，已證明水牛及狗為傳染是項疾病之媒介。杭州工作隊，復設分隊二處：（一）為防治薑片蟲工作隊，駐蕭山，係與浙江蕭山湘湖師範學校合作，除醫療工作外，並從事各種研究工作。（二）為防治肺並殖器吸蟲病工作隊。駐紹興，研究肺並殖器吸蟲之生活史，及螺絲，蟹，家畜，野獸之檢查。</p>
<h3>皮膚的衛生和皮膚病的預防</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>俗語講。醫病不如防病。所以與其有最好的方法，去醫治疾病。還不如明瞭預防的方法。去防止疾病的發生。尤為省時而便利。注意皮膚的衛生。不但可以預防皮膚病。而且對於全身內部的臟器。都有著良好的影響。因為這兩者的關係。很爲密切。原來皮膚包裹著吾人的全身。和外界一切的事物相接觸。好似戰事時候的第一道防綫。抵抗外界一切的刺㦸。防護內部臟器的安寗。同時皮膚愈强練。更能促進內臟的活動力。這是皮膚對於內臟的關係。但是內部臟器的健全與否。也和皮膚有關係。例如某種臟器有疾病的時候。皮膚面上就可以發生著許多的變化。譬如有心臟病和肺病的人。他的容貌。大多憔悴。皮膚的光澤和顏色。也不神彩煥發。完全呈蒼白的狀態。還有息不眠症和神經衰弱病人的面色。也大多沒有健康的色彩。黄膽病人的皮膚呈黃色。癌腫病人的皮膚呈土色。吾人看到了皮膚面上的變化。就可以推想內部臟器有如何的變化。所以要預防皮膚病。除了研究皮膚自己强壯的方法以外。同時還要注意到全身的健康。方才可以達到真正預防的目的。</p>
<p>怎樣叫做皮膚的衛生呢。實際上講起來。以保持和增進皮膚的健康為目的。就是強壯的皮膚。對於外界的刺戟有抵抗力。雖然有疾病侵犯的時候。也能抵抗他。或雖不能完全免除。終不至變成重症。這就是預防法的第一義。但是講到皮膚的衛生。還和美容術有關係。因爲皮膚病的大多數。都是對美容上有損害。一般就診病人的目的。也大多以損害他的美容而憂心。所以醫治皮膚病。不但除去病人的痛苦。還要注意他美容的一點呢。</p>
<p>講到美容的意義。從吾們醫學的常識講起來。凡是有疾病的皮膚所包裹的容貌。是不美的。是醜陋的。倘能助長皮膚的健康。自然能够保持他的美容。也就是注意皮膚的衛生。方才能够助長他的美。質言之。就是真正的美容。僅可求之於健康的皮膚。所以要保護皮膚的美。非注意皮膚的衛生不可。</p>
<p>皮膚的衛生。依照上面所講。除了注意全身的營養以外。還要注意皮膚的强壯。皮膚强壯。不但能够增進皮膚的抵抗力。抵禦外來的刺㦸。還可以使皮膚生理的機能圓滿發展。原來薄弱的皮膚。與以剛强的活力。皮膚的強壯法。就是皮膚的鍜鍊。空氣和日光。最為必要。就是直接接觸於皮膚的寒冷溫暖。從平素練就一種抵抗的習慣。尤以在小兒時代。更當注意。那他的效果。更加顯著。例如外出的時候。把小兒用手套圍巾。重重包裹著。更著厚的皮服。復用帽傘等遮蔽日光。這樣的都不相宜。因為沒有意義的恐懼寒氣和些小的微風。都是使皮膚益加薄弱稍不留意就會發生感冒。所以這樣的習慣。應當嚴禁才好。</p>
<p>接觸新鮮的空氣。這也是衛生上重要條件的一種。不論冬夏。凡是遇到天氣良好的日子。最好到郊外森林或是鄉間去步行。這能够使新陳代謝活潑。血液循環盛旺。結果就給與皮膚以良好的影響。野外運動對於皮膚。極有利益。尤以浴於日光中。他的功効更大。此因日光的溫度。作用到皮膚上面。不但使皮膚的作用亢進。而且日光中重要的紫外綫。吸收到人體裏面。使血液中發生著維他命（這叫做抗佝僂病素的營養）。新陳代謝著明旺盛。同時直接刺㦸皮膚。振奮生理機能。不但增加皮膚的抵抗力。而且因光綫的絶大殺菌力。把皮膚面上所附著的種種微菌殺死。吾人醫治病人。用人工太陽燈的時候。雖僅少的時間。病人常覺到精神爽快。呼吸平穩。脈搏充實。體力緊張。元氣振奮。鄉間的農夫和野外工外人的皮膚。大多堅強。這並不是生來如此。是從幼小的時候。慣受狂風烈日。並浴於日光中。是一種長年月間鍜鍊的結果。倘使有人要急速的變換他的生活法。作劇烈的運動。或與以激烈的刺㦸。那反為危險。能够逐漸地注意鍜鍊實行。習慣了以後。自然可以得到健康的皮膚。</p>
<p>冷水浴和冷水摩擦。是鍜鍊皮膚的一個良好方法。冷水浴很是劇烈。只有壯年的人。可以應用。老年，小兒和一般女子。多不適宜。在冬季的時候。更加應當注意。因爲有發生感冒的危險。普通用冷水浴的人。在浴中常覺到多少的戰慄。所以入浴的時候。以達到毛髮豎立為最大限度。應當即刻出浴。用乾燥的毛巾。強度摩擦。達到全身溫暖為止。倘在過於寒冷的時候。加些熱水。也不要緊。</p>
<p>冷水摩擦比較冷水浴。容易施行。就是用手帕或毛巾。浸以冷水。摩擦全身的皮膚。從肩胛起。順次達到胸，背，腹，兩腕，臀部等部。急速摩擦。施行的時期。也和冷水浴相同。以早晨起床的時候。最爲適宜。或者就寢之前。也可以施行。這兩種方法。都是刺㦸皮</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>膚的神經。能够適當施行。可以使血液循環旺盛。皮膚强壯。對於全身的保健上。是非常有益的。</p>
<p>乾燥摩擦是一種最穩妥的方法。就是女子和幼年的人。也容易實行。用乾燥毛巾摩擦全身的皮膚。摩擦的順序。也和冷水摩擦一樣。先從肩部。順次達到脚部。或者不用毛巾。用自己的手掌。靜静地摩擦皮膚也好。有一種皮膚過敏的人。往往對於冷水摩擦或乾燥摩擦。難以施行的時候。可以先用手掌摩擦。等到習慣了以後。再來用冷水摩擦。</p>
<p>海水浴也可以作為冷水摩擦的一種。可是海水中所含有的鹽味。對於皮膚。也無特別的意義。有時往往對於某種皮膚病。譬如濕疹，癢疹等等。接觸海潮和風。往往使病勢增惡。但是浴於海中。因波浪的動摇。刺㦸皮膚的神經。使生理機能亢進。同時裸體的臥於海灘之砂中。為日光浴。真是一舉兩得。對於皮膚的鍜鍊。是一個極好的機會。</p>
<p>溫水浴能够擴張皮膚的血管。旺盛汗的分泌。可以促進新陳代謝。在短時間內。可以使心神爽快。衛生上極爲重要。尤以溫浴的時候。用刷子或海綿等。爲除去垢穢而去摩擦全身的皮膚。可以助長皮膚的營養。但是要鍜鍊皮膚。預防感冒。那末冷水和乾燥摩擦。比較的優艮。熱水浴能够淸潔皮膚。衛生上也是很重要的。</p>
<p>總之皮膚過敏的人。容易發生皮膚病，和感冒。常用上述的方法，去鍜鍊皮膚。冬夏之間。繼續施行。柔弱的皮膚。可以變成强健。對於感冒和皮膚疾患。也可以得到相當預防的功効呢。（未完）</p>
<h3>中波醫界之聯絡</h3>
<p>— 章尹明</p>
<p>波蘭兩醫士訪華任職考試院</p>
<p>威格爾教授發明預防傷寒苗</p>
<p>波蘭之醫學。在世界亦負有相當聲譽。如克拉哥大學及沃佛大學對於醫學之研究。均有甚大貢獻。但中波醫界在歷史上尚少聯絡。民國二十二年六月。有波蘭著名少年醫士衛訥士與威拉斯基兩氏。熱心研究醫學心理學。尤注意於心理病理學之各種問題。來亞洲實地考察。經羅馬尼亞。蘇俄。土耳其。波斯。印度。檳榔嶼。新加坡。香港以達上海。與中國醫學會聯絡。任蘇州精神病院職務一月。旋加入中波文化恊會。民國二十三年。考試院聘衛訥士任該院衛生處主任醫官。威拉斯基為衛生顧問。咸能克盡厥職。威氏曾北行三月。在恊和醫院神經科工作。衛氏則於去夏隨戴季陶院長及班禪大師赴杭。主持各項衛生事宜。兩氏於去年十二月十七日離華赴日。轉往美洲。預定本年六月可返波蘭。完成其環遊世界。實地研究之壯舉。兩氏居華凡一載有半。其醫術深得各方信仰。中波醫界之關係。由是日漸密切。波蘭教士留華傳教者頗衆。華北各地尤多。且多附設醫院施診。最著名者則爲河北順德府波蘭教會眼科醫院。波蘭來傳教士據精密之統計。死於傷寒病者達百分之七十五。迨一九三○年。波蘭里華大學生物學系主任威格爾教授。發明最有效之預防傷寒病苗。經多年之試騐。埋首實習工作。始獲最后成功。翌年。盧頓神父即携此威格爾預防傷寒病苗來華。在各天主教會中試行預防注射。成績斐然。威格爾預防傷寒病苗。最初僅在威格爾教授實騐室中製造。一九三一年北平比國天主教堂因試用功效圓滿。逕電波蘭威格爾教授請求開示方單。在平製造。藉利病人。教授覆電報可。教會因派張漢民醫士赴波。親向教授請益。留波凡二閲月。盡得製造之法而返。故兹後北平比國天主教堂亦能製造此苗。波蘭教士經此預防注射。死亡率乃鋭减。威格爾預防傷寒苗在華僅流行於各天主教會間。尚未應用普遍。頗望我國醫界能予以相當研究。去年十月三日起在首都舉行之全國醫藥會議。張漢民。羅忠兩醫師曾提及威格爾教授之新發明。頗引起全塲注意。羅馬教皇爲奬勵威格爾教授發明功勳起見。特賜以聖格利克雷主教榮譽云。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十四）脚氣病（Beriberi）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做脚氣病？</p>
<p>（答）脚氣病是一種全身營養障礙，就是食物中缺乏乙種生活素而起的疾病。</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病流行於那幾處地方？</p>
<p>（答）大都流行於以白米爲食物的地方，像亞西亞東部，南美洲和非洲的一部分。</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病的原因，是不是單因爲食物中缺乏乙種生活素？</p>
<p>（答）多數學者，已决定脚氣病的原因，是在乎食物中缺乏乙種生活素（維他命乙）。可是真的脚氣病和人類缺乏乙種維他命症，未必完全相同。但除心臟症狀不相同外，其他症狀，很相像的。</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病和人類乙種生活素缺乏症，心臟症狀有什麽同？</p>
<p>（答）脚氣病，心臟症狀很是顯著；而人類乙種生活素缺乏症，循環症狀不很著明。可是消貨障礙，非常劇烈。</p>
<p>（問）説明脚氣病的原因，今日有那機種學説？</p>
<p>（答）有中毒和傳染二種學説。</p>
<p>（問）中毒説是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）中毒説，就是白米中毒。這個學説，比較有力。因爲脚氣病，祗見於白米食的國民，同時鳥類白米病又和脚氣病相像，就因爲白米是已經剝去糠皮內的重要生活素之故。</p>
<p>（問）傳染説是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）傳染説的出發點，在乎脚氣有流行性而又和每年季節有關。可是這個學説，信任的人較少。</p>
<p>（問）發生脚氣病的誘因，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）誘因很多：第一是温熱和濕潤，所以在酷熱而潮濕夏季較多，春秋次之，冬季較少。第二是運動過度，或運動不足。第三是精神過勞。第四是各種傳染病像傷寒，流行性感冒結核，腎臟病，貧血，糖尿病消耗性疾患，與及姙娠産褥等。</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病和體質有没有關係？</p>
<p>（答）體質上有没有容易患脚氣的話，並無一定。但脚氣病多見於後天性神經質，或胸腺淋巴質的人。</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病和年齡性别有無關係？</p>
<p>（答）壯年男子居多，十五歳至二十五歳最多，少年和老人較少。</p>
<p>（問）職業上有没有關係？</p>
<p>（答）除農夫外，下層階級的人最多。又囚犯亦多發生。</p>
<p>漁夫，船員，坑工，紡績女工，僧尼等最多。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十七）眼能視物的理由（續）</p>
<p>正視眼</p>
<p>因爲網膜上面分佈視神經。而能引起視覺。又若攝影機的集光透鏡和乾片間的距離。可以任意伸縮（伸縮摺襞）。所以可使物像來得顯明。在眼球亦有同樣的作用。因爲水晶體能應物體的遠近。可由毛樣肌（圖十一）的作用。而隨意變換他的彎曲程度。藉此可使物像明顯映在網膜的上面。這種的作用。就是眼球的調節作用。</p>
<p>我們依照上面講的眼的構造和眼的生理作用。雙方觀察起來。當然就可明白眼能視物的理由。因此我的結論。就是説……物體的光綫。射入我們眼球角膜上的時候。經水晶體的屈折。由網膜的視神經。傳達於大腦的視覺中樞。而發生視覺。更由眼球的調節作用。使此物像。特别明顯。</p>
<p>正視眼的成立。乃由前節所述「眼能視物的理由」實施攝影機所具的機能而成。這種正視眼，就是一種具有普通健全視力的眼球。她的能力。可將無論或遠或近由光綫所生的物像。經過虹彩收放的調度，水晶體的屈折，及她天然的調節作用。完全適合映在網膜的上面（參照附圖）。所以遠近的物體。都能明瞭看見。並不受何限制。又用不着什麽矯正眼鏡的輔助。這種眼球的能力。完全恰合攝影機的功能。凡欲服務軍隊，航空，海關，及引港等職的人員。如有此類正視眼。則對於檢查目力一項。總可及格。不成問題。</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學（四）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>有益無害的止痛術</p>
<p>（一）休息　大概講痛即需休息，不管什麽樣痛因動加劇即需休息。比如紅眼睛痛的厲害除滴眼藥外休息眼睛是必須的。其餘身體别部分的痛也是一樣道理。身體無論何部分發炎或受傷痛時就當休息。發炎的部分休息一，可以减去疼痛二，可以帮助身體的修補工作使快恢復原狀。這一種的辦法是很平常人人可行的，好像没有述説的價值其實不然，雖是很平常但在止痛的方法內却是很重要的。應當特别留意。</p>
<p>（二）臥勢　病人休息臥床有一定的臥勢使他覺着痛苦少些。如果有這一種的臥勢就當帮助他得到。比如有時須將身體腫脹的部分墊高使血流回容易便可减少痛苦。兹舉一例，我從前有一患心病的病人。他在醫院時很好。後來他回家了。到家後也的病又轉劇，後來他又回到醫院。我見他的兩腿腫的很大他也覺着脹痛。我隨即呌他睡在床上將他脚腿部的床轉高，他的兩下肢大概高起八十度。他不到半個小時兩腿的腫完全消去了，也再不痛。由此可見適宜的姿勢也是有相當價值的。適宜的姿勢也須時時調換。若是一種臥勢太長久也容易使肢節不靈動。</p>
<p>（三）活動　休息當然是第一要緊但活動亦當在適宜時開始。如折斷骨時將骨接好後必須一兩個月使折斷處完全不動，但到了不妨礙折斷骨時就要活動。一切發炎的部分也是一樣，一到快好時就當開始活動。這樣起初活動時或者不免稍痛，但繼續的活動就要有進歩。起頭活動時用力務由輕漸重，時間務由短漸長。切不要過度免傷及發炎處。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺説（四三）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第九章　臨床上的經過</p>
<p>現在可以提到完成的型式，滲出性和增生性的大概情形了！附屬在這兩種以下，也有好幾種子目的分别；這在病理解剖一章已經提起過了。關於他們每一種型式的特點，如果一一叙述，那當然是很繁瑣的；此處不妨將顯著的兩種型式，乾酪性肺炎和急性粟粒結核，單獨提出來；因爲他們在臨床上係比較習見的，並且係一個代表滲出性，一個代表增生性的。這雙方的詳細經過，現在且分述於下面：</p>
<p>（一）乾酪性肺炎　這是一種最嚴重的型式。他是急性突然開始的。起初即發高熱，可至攝氏三十九或四十度光景，這在表面觀察，和急性傳染病中的傷寒敗血膿毒等症是很類似的。和尋常的急性肺炎症尤像，不過最初發生戰慄的狀態比較少見罷了！肺部現濁音，聽診時現氣管枝音，這是很顯著的肺部變化，融解狀態是不大見着的。高熱稽留不退，成稽留性熱型。痰在開始時帶化膿性，時現綠色，鐵銹色是狠鮮見的；痰中結核菌和彈力纖維是很多的，這是唯一的證明，和尋常肺炎症的不同地方。但在最初時，有時也會不見於標本的。尿中時現蛋白，脾臟腫大，血液圖像現嚴重中毒狀態，白血球數增加，多核性增加，淋巴球减少，血液昇降速度亦增加。乾酪性肺炎的趨勢，大半係由急性嚴重狀態，數星期內即陷於不治的。假使這種急性難關結度過了，此際熱度較低，其他的一般狀態也會稍住的；但空洞的發現是免不了，結果變成慢性空洞性的本病了！這在最後的結果，也是大半不良的。他在診斷方面，和肺炎肺膿瘍等症，係比較難於鑑别的。這方面最重要的，就是病歷詢問之不厭煩瑣，以及痰的精密檢查罷了！X光的檢查，也有一部分助力的。至於他的起因，除開一部分係康健人體直接發生外，大半是肺結核每期的合併症；換一句話説，就是：每種肺結核症的最後一歩，是很多發生乾酪性肺炎，以作最後之收塲的。</p>

<h3>論農村投資</h3>
<p>— 韋東</p>
<p>年來中國農村經濟的衰落，已引起一般人的注意，救濟的聲浪，也隨着震動了全國，在中央政府統率之下，有行政院農村復興委員會和全國經濟委員會農業處等等機關的組織在地方政府管轄之下，有各省市縣政府所設立的各種救濟農村委員會，在私人方面，有各種慈善團體所發起的賑災，和銀行界的農村投資，尤其是銀行界的農村投資，其鼓吹和進行，更較其他各種農村運動要來得兇猛和迅速，這裏就從這風行一時的「銀行界的農村投資」題目下找出幾點來加以討論。</p>
<p>一　銀行界爲什麽要投資農村？</p>
<p>要明白銀行界爲什麽要投資農村，用不着深的研究，祇須從銀行業本身的動態上去考察一下，就可以知道他們主要的動機何在了，在銀行的創設，照學理來説，是在爲社會服務，一方面集中社會上的遊資，他方面供給工農商業以流動的資金，可是也並不是以專一救濟他人爲任務的慈善團體。把學理撒開，拿現實的情形來説，一般經營銀行業者的最大企圖，僅祗是：（一）在放欵和存欵的高低利率差額中找取利潤，和（二）利用集中的雄厚資力，從事各種投機事業或近於投機事業的經營而尋求贏餘，中國的銀行業，向來也就是抱的這種主張。近數年來的中國經濟，在日趨嚴重的世界經濟恐慌和國內各地農村普遍崩潰的二重壓廹之下，形成了迅速衰落的狀態。自然，在中國經濟範圍以內的銀行業，也隨着碰到了極大的危害。在他們的第一種企圖方面，自農村經濟破産之後，流入商業都市中的農業資金，不能再反趨農村從事農業的生産，於是相率投入銀行存欵中去換取利息，致銀行的存欵因之大增。同時，外國製造品的輸入大量增加，毁壞了中國國內幼穉民族工業的生産，一般人民購買力的低减，促成全國商業的凋零，結果工廠商店紛紛倒閉，銀行善放欵的基礎動摇，放欵的數額隨即鋭减。這兩種傾向不同的趨勢的發展，遂使銀行䐤存欵和放欵的比例失去平衡。當民國二十一年的時候，全國一百四十六家銀行的所有各項存欵，總計二，一八三，九五九，九五七元，放欵總計一，九四六，八六四，一三七元，（參考中國銀行出版的一九三四年銀行年鑑）放欵對存欵的比率，尚爲百分之八十九。可是到了民國二十二年，這種比率的低减，却就有點驚人了。僅祇拿大家所公認的五十七家重要銀行和信託公司的營業來看，各項存欵已達二，○三二，○一四，六二六元，和民國二十一年度的一百四十六家銀行的存欵已相差無幾，但是二十二年度的放欵，則祇有一，三八五，五三七，八五二元，（參考中央銀行月報第三卷第十號潘恒敏之民國二十二年度各銀行及信託公司營業報告統計一文）放欵對存欵的比率，降低到百分之六十八，民國二十二年以後，中國的經濟情形，不但没有改善，更且比較從前，更爲惡化，就大勢來猜度，民國二十三年度的放欵對存欵的比率，恐怕比前一年還要來得微小。在第二種企圖方面，從前的中國銀行業，因爲環境和歷史的關係，對於新式金融業務的經營，不能與外商在華所設立的銀行競爭，對於舊式金融業務的活動，又已有錢莊銀號等各自分劃的勢力範圍，不容許銀行業去從而染指，於是在業務上遂逐漸流於畸形的發展狀態，隨着外商銀行而專一從事各種投機事業的經營，其中最主要的約爲房地産投資，和公債標金等賣空買空，其次則爲各種冒險事業的放欵，如影戲院，跑狗塲，或近似賭博機關的娱樂塲所。單拿上海來説，高樓大厦，隨處皆是，觀其名稱，不是某行大樓，就是某行别墅，各種交易所和標金證劵市塲，不僅有日市的賣買，甚至有人提倡夜市的交易，至於茶樓戲院等娱樂塲所的發展，恰巧和農村的崩潰情形背道而馳。民國二十一二年中國農村經濟初破産的時候，這種繁榮情形曾把各大商業都市裝飾得非常興盛，不過這種的興盛，祇是一種遊資集中而没有適當生産用途的一表現，没有健全的農村經濟來作他的基礎，正如建築在浮沙上的樓閣，不久就發現了種種的險象，而要崩坍。再加之外患的侵凌，東北事變後，滬戰繼着發生，華北華南又時告不安，於是各銀行所經營的非正軌業務，遂漸漸發生困難，因農村破産而流入商業都市的羣衆，不能租借銀行業所建築的華厦，中國國內産業的衰落，時局的不靖，以及各資本主義國家貨幣政策的變幻無常，使銀行業的賣空買空業務不易經營。</p>
<p>銀行業的經營者，是最聰明不過的事業家，他們决不會因爲上述二種企圖的失望，就讓别人的現金存在自己的金庫裏，還要付給别人一筆很大的利息。他們舊有的獲利手叚失效，可以再闢新的管利路綫，於是農業放欵的經營，遂爲他們所注意上了。農業放欵，大都是以農業産品和土地來作抵押，尤其是以土地爲最大部分。土地，在銀行家帶上金邊眼鏡的賬目中，是最呆板的不動産，過去不但是商業銀行没有起過「投資農村」的念頭，就足以農實等業掛名的銀行，也都放棄了自己的責任而寧願和商業銀行從事同樣業務的競爭，不過在現在這種的非常時期裏面，農業中的土地，雖然和工業中的機器同樣的是生産原素之一，但是以土地來比機器，他的穩健性却要來得强硬多了。因爲中國是一個大農業國家，百分之八十以上的人民是農民，工業生産的停頓，並不能使中國人民，的生存機會完全消滅，農業的生産，却是中國人民不可或缺的生存機能，縱使中國經濟仍是不能地繼續衰落，農業也是站在最後的一個階叚。</p>
<p>中國銀行界爲什麽要投資農村？簡單地説來，是爲他們過多的存欵找出路，若是硬要把「救濟農村」的慈善面具加在銀行家的臉上的時候，也祇能説銀行家爲了要增加一般人民的購買力來鼓勵工商業的繁榮，藉工商業的繁榮來發展他們的對工商業放欵，不能不恢復農村的生産能力，所以他們要救濟農村，投資農村。</p>
<p>二　農村投資的技術問題</p>
<p>中國銀行業對於農村投資所使用的方式，約可分爲三種：（一）農業倉庫貸欵，（二）農民抵押貸欵，（三）合作社貸欵。第一第二兩種辦法，係由銀行自己直接經營，這裏可以不必拿來討論。第三種辦法，是借合作社作爲銀行業與農村的中間機關，也就是近來最風行的一種社會運動。現在在銀行業領導之下的合作社，有生産合作社，運銷合作社，生産運銷合作社，以及信用合作社等等的種類。合作社爲近代的一種經濟組織，其主要的目的，在避免生産者和消費者的中間剝削，在歐美，及蘇聯各國，這種組織頗爲普遍。不過一種社會運動或社會組織的産生，是由社會的環境和需要求决定的，比如蘇聯能實行社會主義，但是美國目前却没有這種需要，再如近世紀來政治上所盛行的代議制，在歐美各國，俱能保持着牠的優美的特徵，但是行之於我國，在民初的時候，就發現了許多賄選的劣點。合作社的理論雖好。不見得立刻就能普遍到中國，縱然能够使中國都有這種合作社的組織，在速成的運動之下，又不見得會能够達到合作社的真正條件，因爲參加這種組織的羣衆，在文化程度上至少應當要達到某種一定的水準。老實説來，中國是一個文化落後的國家，同時所有一切的進歩表現，都是一種畸態，經濟的情形是這樣，教育的情形也是這樣，少數受過高等教育的人，會談社會主義，會談亞細亞生産方式，但是大部分的人民，是根本上目不識丁，不知道經濟是一個什麽東西。目前要像蘇聯一樣地組織起三十二萬個合作社來，那是絶對不可能的，因爲蘇聯現在已經掃盡文盲，中國呢？至少恐怕還有半數以上的人民是文盲，或許有人要説，一切社會運動都是逐漸發展起來的，這個我們要曉得現在中國農村經濟的破産，好像是患了急性病的「中風症」，希望由合作社來救濟農村，正好像希望小孩子長大了去學醫生再來治病一樣的急需和遲緩的不同。假若一定要把合作社的組織迅速地普遍起來，在作者的偏見裏，覺得有下列的幾種困難。</p>
<p>（一）關於組織合作社的人員問題　因爲一般農民智識的缺乏，所有一切合作社的組織和經營，惟有完全依賴從事合作運動的領導者，現在在中國能够領導組織合作社的人才，祗有曾經受過合作教育的高等智識階級，和在農村中具有權威的鄉紳。拿前一項人才來説，以曾經受過二十世紀洗禮，讀洋書穿洋服的高等智識階級，不見得能過得慣尚在十八九世紀的農村生活，或許也會發生像大學農科學生怕泥水沾汚了西裝褲一類的笑話，同時讀慣洋書的學生，不見得能明瞭中國農村的情形，不識字的農民，也不見得能接受西洋的文明，作者曾親耳聽見一個從事農業合作運動的人，説過下面的一段話：「合作社的事，是頂容易不過的，每個月拿幾十塊錢的薪金，還有幾十塊錢的辦公費，辦公費是可以拿來買私人的東西的。等到調派的時候，凡是辦公費所買的東西都可以私人帶來，因爲這是試騐的性質。至於工作，也並不吃苦，上面來視察的人，不一定會詳細的來查問你，祗要瞎吹一頓，就可應付過去，若是有人參觀，那更是無所謂了，因爲他們根本上就不懂得什麽呌作合作。」這就可代表習識階級所導領的合作事業的成績。拿後一種人才來説，鄉紳就是農村中的權威者，也大半就是富農以上的地主階級，他們雖不懂得什麽呌作「合作事業」但是頗知如何去剝削農民，在這種特殊勢力下所成立的合作社，其所得結果是將從前個人對農民的壓榨，改爲集體對農民的壓榨，農民的本身，並没有解除被剝削的痛苦。</p>
<p>（二）關於合作社資本收集的問題　銀行業對農村放欵，是由合作社來轉貸的，那麽農民在没有得到銀行貸欵以前，先就得將合作社組織起來，合作社　組織，是需要社員拿出資本來的，在現在這種農村經濟極端貧困的時候，一般農民决不會有剩餘資本來作合作社的資本，雖説合作社的股本數額是很少的，但是大部分的佃農和自耕農，差不多都是拿農業生産品在收穫期後還給一般高利貸者，隨着又向高利貸者借欵維持生活，在這種週復的借貸生活裏面，不但是没有參加合作社的可能，同時一般高利貸者也不見得會允許他們脱離高利貸的束縛。結果所謂農業合作社，不過是少數地主階級拿資本來組織的剝削團體，利用金融資本的雄厚勢力來加緊對農民的經濟壓榨。</p>
<p>就上述的二點來看，可以斷定中國的合作事業，和歐美各國的合作事業有點不同。去年英藉合作信用專家施克蘭氏</p>
<p>視察陝冀鄂三省合作社後的報告：（大公報二十三年十二月十二日）在他所視察的三省中，没有一個合作社曾辦理帳目查核，這就是表明合作社組織不健全。又如去年浙江之救濟農村運動，農業金融機關有四十二所，全省合作社多至一千零七十二社，大家以爲最後必收最大的成效；不料希望是希望，事實是事實，據全浙生産會議的報告，就蘭谿縣的堆棧情形來説，「抵押數量之限制甚，必須抵押二十元或五十元以上，中小農民當然無若大之産量，結果抵押者十之八九，以廉價收買農産品，押與堆棧待價而沽，更以抵押所得，爲廉價收買農産品之資金，」這更很明顯的合作社事業操縱在少數有資産者的手裏，其成效是加緊對農民的剝削。</p>
<p>作者在學理上决不反對合作事業，但是事實上合作事業是需要文化程度來促進的，上面已經説過了，中國農村經濟崩潰是患的「中風」急症，而合作社祗一是未來的醫生，要是把醫生應學的十年學程呌他花費十日的功夫速成起來，結果一定是一個庸醫。我們再要曉得現在中國農村經濟的衰落，是佃農和小自耕農的生産破産，這種佃農和自耕農佔中國農民中的絶對大部分，而現在的合作社，似乎祇能帮助富農大地主去改良種子和農業機械化，對於純粹以體力圖生存的農民是没有什麽補益的，所以中國的合作事業，在民國二十年祗有三千六百一十八社，到民國二十三年，增加到九千九百四十八社，其中農業合作社由三千三百二十八社增加到九千五百七十八社，（全國合作社統計）但是中國的農業恐慌，並不因之而稍殺，這就是一個很顯明的例子。</p>
<p>三　農村投資與土地問題的將來</p>
<p>中國農村經濟的崩潰，天災，人禍，以及帝國主義國家經濟勢力在華的發展，都是些很大的動力，可是土地分配的不均匀，也是一個很重大的原素。中國雖然没有像俄國在帝俄時代那種集中土地的顯著現象，但是近世紀來土地由小農的手中歸併到富農，再由富農歸併到大地主的趨勢，這已經是一般研究農村經濟的學者所公認的事實。土地的集中，或論在那一種政治制度裏面，都會發生出一種極不好的影響，因爲土地愈集中，則貧農愈增加，貧農愈增加，則農民離開農村的愈衆多，農田的荒蕪愈廣大，結果社會上的秩序混亂，國家農業的生産衰落。（社會主義制度下的國家集中土地是例外）。所以孫中山先生在三民主義中所倡導的民生主義的理論，其重心就在平均地權，所謂平均地權，就是將土地分配均匀，使耕者能够有其田，在没有實行平均地權以前，其主要的土地政策，則在限制土地的集中，現在這種金融業的農村投資，其對於農業土地上所發生的影響，恰巧是一支促進土地加速集中的生力軍，因爲銀行業對農的放欵，若是由銀行直接放給農民，當然是爲着穩健起見，首先放欵給領有巨額土地的大地主，那麽銀行業投資的機能，是在改良中國農業的生産，這種改良的效力，自然是由機械能力排除了農民內體的勞動力，由生産增加而得到的利潤遂成爲大地主吞併小地主甲地的資本，於是金融資本經過農業資本的染色而成爲大地主的剝削工其。至於由銀行直接經營農民抵押或倉庫放欵，則係對小農以下的農民的投資，根據這種投資方式而跑進農村的金融資本，最後是直接經營農業，將金融資本運用在農業的生産力面，把農業的土地由抵押而逐漸變爲金融業一部分的資本。要是用合作社來作銀行和農民的中間機關，這和銀行的直接經營並没有什麽多大的區别，因爲銀行可以左右他們自己所領導的合作社，合作社又可以直接管轄農民，農民和銀行間雖有合作社的離間，但是經濟勢力的貫穿，是不受中間機關的阻止的。例如農民以農産品送入合作社作抵押而要求放欵，表面上，此種抵押農産品的處置權是屬於合作社，實際上合作社的資金就是銀行業的放欵，於是此種抵押農産品的最後處置權，當然是屬之於銀行了。所以農民的生産品流入合作社之後，即無異於存入銀行的堆棧中，這種充作抵押品的農産品，在合作社的規定上，是可以由農民備欵取回的，但是事實上一般農民的經濟能力，祗在循環的借貸狀態中維持着生命，結果大部分的農民是無法將抵押品贖取回來的。因之，農民又無形中將農産品從物價變化上所能獲得的利潤，和以勞力從事運輸而够得到的代價完全喪失。無欵義的，這種銀行業的農村投資，是用科學的方法來打倒舊式的高利貸者，從而取有他們的剝削地位。這樣子繼續下去，在金融資本活動之下的農業土地集中趨勢，將較過去的大地主的吞併更爲迅速。</p>
<p>農業和土地問題是不能分開的，拿美國來作一個例子，美國農業的生産方法，是應用的近代科學化的新技術，但是在世界經濟恐慌期內，仍然是産生了農業恐慌，同時他的恐慌，並不是由於種子不良，或是生産技術落後，因爲一方面有大部分的農民找不到充飢的麵包，一方面却有大量的農産品傾入汪洋的大海中，這就是基於土地分配不均的緣故。若是我們果真要救濟中國的農村，决不是希望銀行界對農村投資的期限要長，利率要低，不要競爭，和改良種子，應用機械耕種所能奏效的，最少應該由政府以限制土地集中的政策爲立塲，以統制的方式，施行緊急的經濟的救濟辦法，從恢復一般農民的生産能力而逐漸趨於生産的改良，這樣，或許能度過這有關中國生死存亡的農業恐慌的難關。</p>
<h3>各國之農業抵押放欵合作制度</h3>
<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>自從現代的工業和都市相輔的發展以來，農村土地價格日以增長，土地的耕耘由零碎而變爲集合的大農塲，生産的手段由賤陋的農具而變爲精巧的機器，土地的利用由少數人工，肥料之粗放的經營而變爲精密農作，凡此種種，無一不需要大量資本，是以農民頓感覧金融上之困難。欲向私人告貸，則所負利息太高，頗不適於低利潤農事經營之用。欲向銀行借欵，又因爲農業放欵之期間過長，及抵押品性質之不適合（普通銀行不樂於承受土地爲抵押品，）所以也難以達到目的，在這種環境下，農民只有自己去謀解决的方策，或者靠政府來加以輔助；屬於前者的是各國農民所組織之信用合作社，屬於後者的則爲各國政府所設立的農民或土地銀行。在最初二者之間不發生什麽關係，合作社是與農民們非常之密切，但是在創立的時候，多半感資金的不足，加入的社員，既爲謀告貸資金而來，又甚能存入大批欵項，以供流通，所以結果農民金融的問題，仍然未得到解决。銀行是當有資金，但是農民與他們相隔太遠，銀行不容易了解他們的個人與家庭狀况，所以借欵也不易達到目的；到後來雙方面合作進行，即是銀行將大宗資金貸與合作社，合作社再按社員之需要，而加以分配，才免除了上述的困難。現在歐美若干國家的農民抵押放欵合作制度大都是依照這原則施行的，有若干係合作社本身從事債劵之發行，以吸取資金，兹將歐美各國之抵押放欵合作制度擇其要者縷述如後，以供吾人之參證。</p>
<p>德國的農業金制度成立最早，也是今日各國中允稱完備的一個。其土地抵押合作之機關爲土地抵押合作社（Land'Challen），最早者爲一七六九年之西萊西亞抵押合作社，其後各地先後仿傚，迄十九世紀末爲止，統稱爲舊式的土地抵押合作社，在最初由於一般需要流動資金的大地主組合而成，是强廹式的，凡是有土地的貴族，無論借欵與否皆需加入。銀行放欵與其社員，其資金來源爲其發行的債劵，債劵的擔保是各社員的抵押品土地價值，所以他發行的數額不能超過放欵金額。社員請求借欵者需先陳報其抵押品，由銀行加以評價，然後予以柞當數額的債劵。普通放欵的限度，不得超過其抵押品評價百分之五十。社員領得此項證劵後即可持向市塲出售，易得現金。債劵的利息，普通爲三厘或四厘，隨金融市塲的變動而决定，實際上合作社僅爲放欵人（即購買債劵者）與借欵人之媒介，對於借欵之本金與利息的償付，毫不負責任，如借欵人不能償付債務，持劵者僅能直接與記載於證劵上的債務人請求。（僅能變賣其抵押品）這一種的制度顯然的有許多缺點，最大的是：（甲）合作社對於放欵人與借欵人不發生密切之關係，對於借欵人之償還義務，毫無保證，不能充分表明合作之意義。（乙）合作社不應强廹令人加入。（丙）合作社社員不應限於貴族，對於中小地主亦使有同樣的機會。</p>
<p>到了十九世紀以後，合作社確經過了改革，加入的社員是廢除了階級的限制，並且特設了减債基金，因此合作社所發行之債劵，其擔保品雖仍爲抵押品之全部，但其元本則由合作社减債基金中支付，換言之，就是合作社本身負有償還的責任。債劵及其附屬的利息劵都是無記名式，可以自由出讓或轉售。社員借欵的數額，可達到抵押品評價的三分之二，需用之於農業生産事業，借欵期限最長者八十年，還期每六月舉行一次，將借欵之利息全部加人本欵中，然後平均規定分期償還數額。</p>
<p>土地抵押信用合作社，既非以謀利為目的，所以對於社會是没有贏餘的分配，全數滾入公債金項下。合作社之組織有理事會，處理社中債劵之發行與審查抵押品等事務，有地方局管理該地域內各合作社之基金等；有總會，處理合作社之重要原則與事務，另有永久委員會，任務在接收理事會之業務報告與審查賬目等。</p>
<p>上述之新式舊式合作社，在大戰前爲數共二十有八，合作社發行之債劵共三十萬萬馬克，在這樣的迅速發展之下，一種集中的統制是非怳之切要。一八七三年時柏林即成立中央土地抵押信用合作社，共有八社加入，其任務爲援助各合作社發行債劵，並爲之代爲保證，其本身也同時發行中央土地證劵（Zentral-Pfandbrief）所有放欵條件與各合作社同。</p>
<p>丹麥之土地抵押合作制度有二，一爲信用合作社，一爲抵押放欵合作社，兹分論之：</p>
<p>（甲）信用合作社（Danlsh）（Kreditkassen）最初成立者爲日德蘭（Jutland）土地信用合作社（一八五一年），其後漸次增加，現時共有十四個。其資金之來源亦爲發行債劵，債劵之發行皆有聯單，每一聯單之數值合美金一百萬或數百萬元。發行期二年或三年，凡領取同一聯單債劵之各借欵人，需爲聯合之擔保，社員繳納之保證品以第一次抵押爲限，借欵數額不能超過其抵押品評價百分之六十至六十六，期限爲五十年或六十年，還欵亦將分期償還制度。合作社爲明瞭社員狀况與防止損失起見，派人向各處查詢社員之經濟狀况，各區亦有代理人報告於合作社，政府對於合作社亦無十分限制，但可以隨時察勘社中情形，如認爲不健全時即可由政府代爲管理或解散之。</p>
<p>（乙）抵押放欵合作社（Mortgage　Asscciations）此種組織之目的乃在輔助上述之信用合作社，接受第二次抵押品放業之業務，其放欵之手續與前同，惟以係第二次抵押品之故，對於評價異常愼重，借欵數額不得超過評價百分之七十五，期限二十五年至三十年，現存之抵押放欵合作社共有九個，政府爲避免相互競爭與衝突，乃於一九○六年成立中央抵押放欵銀行（Mortgatge　Bank　of　the　Kingdom　of　Denmark）資本共五·三六○·○○○元，其任務在購買各合作社所發行之債劵以穩定其市塲之價格。</p>
<p>荷蘭土地抵押合作社隸屬於猶屈特中央銀行（Utrecht　Central　Bank）及英荷温土地抵押銀行（Findhoven　Mortgage,Bank），前者成立於一八九八年，其構成之單位爲各地方之農民合作社及地方信用機關。一九二九年共七二三個合作社加入。銀行之放欵限於第一次抵押品，亦如各國之制度，發行債劵，社員借欵須經過合作社之介紹，期限普通爲十年，長者二十年，同時爲辦理長期信用放欵之便利，另設一特殊合作銀行，資為爲九二四·○○○佛洛林（Florins），發行之債劵達三·五二五·○○○佛洛林，放欵達三·三七八·○○○佛洛林。</p>
<p>英荷温銀行於一八九六年成立，一九二零年共有四九○合作社加入，借欵數額如未超過其抵押品評價百分之五十時則無須抵押品，借欵期限四十年，社員借欵之利息則較債劵之利息爲稍高，所以縻補各種行政費用。</p>
<p>比利時之抵押合作事業集中於魯凡英中央銀行（The　Louvain　Central　Bank），所有一切情形與荷蘭類同，故從略，</p>
<p>瑞典在一七七零年以前，抵押合作事業係由瑞典銀行（Bank　of　Sweden）經營，一八三一年始有抵押放欵合作社（Mortgage　Associations）之組織，現在共有十個，各有一定之範圍，凡當地居民有不動産净值在一一二五元以上者即可爲合作社社員，每合作社所有之社員財産總值不能低於一一二五○○○元，社員借欵之利息普通爲六釐，外加手續費，須分期償還。合作社之資金來源爲發行債劵，其流通之範圍，在極盛時達於德法諸國，但現時僅限於國內。政府爲防止各合作社債劵之互相競爭，乃於一八六一年成立普通抵押銀行GeneralMortgage　Bank　of　Sweden所有債劵，統歸上述機關發行，此後狀况乃趨於穩定。</p>
<p>美國自十九世紀以來，抵押放欵的數值迅速的增加，足以表示農民需要資本之殷切。一九零六年美政府通過聯邦農地放欵法，根據此項法令，設立一聯邦農地放欵處（Fedgral　Farm　Loan　Board）及十二個聯邦土地銀行（Federal　Lank　Bank）。每行之資本爲美金七五○，○○○元，由銀行發行五元之股票募集之，銀行之下，更設若干農地借欵合作社，（National　Farm　Loan　Agociation），由農民十人以上組合而成，成立之後，即可向銀行進行借欵，借欵之社員，須以土地作爲擔保品，其用途限於農事之改進，借欵之數額不能超過其抵押品評價百分之五十，每合作社之貸欵總額不得少於二○，○○○元，社員每借欵百元，即須認購聯邦土地銀行之股票一紙，其後合作社之借欵日以增加，社員承購銀行之股票亦隨之增多，結果把政府所投之資漸漸償還，於是土地銀行的股份遂全歸各合作社所有了。</p>
<p>在行政上合作社有其本身之組織，决定其業務之進行；合作社之上有銀行，銀行又受放欵處之監督。合作社對於其社員之借欵，須擔任抵押品之評價，平時代銀行徵收利息及本金，如社員不能償淸債務，合作社須代爲負淸償之責。</p>
<p>在述明各國的抵押合作制度以後，我們不能不聯想到中國目前的問題。中國目的當然是需要這種組織的，事實上各地成立的合作團體也是以信用合作社爲最普遍，可是因了資金的缺乏，很少的能健全的存在。近數年來都市的銀行也注意到農村的投資與放欵，這當然是可以樂觀的現象。但是要希望這種事業能得正當的發展，至少需注意兩件事。第一以後的農村放欵，需嚴格的限制用之於生産的途徑；第二，我國現時的土地淸丈與登記尚未完備，對於以土地爲抵押之農村放欵事業也是一重障碍，　認爲至少解除了這　　　　，中國農村的抵押放欵事業才能有十足發　　展望。</p>

<h3>論作家的所受影響</h3>
<p>— 禾金</p>
<p>每一個作家，在也㡳寫作過程中，總是多少有意無意地受一點别人的影響的；這等的例子簡直隨便就可舉出許多：法捷也夫（A.　Opageeb）在語句的形式上就可以看出不少的托爾斯泰底輪廓；而美國新作家福克納爾（W.　Faulkner）底前期作品中差不多可以説是充滿了司太因（G.　Stein）底淸脆奇怪的風格的；此外像莫郎（Paul　Morand）之影響了日本的横光利一與美國的海格斯海茂（J.　Heigeshimer）等人；以寫「希凡勃拉尼亞」（Uibandpanua）出了名的蘇聯的新人卡西爾（L.　Kassil）是着實受了一點馬耶考夫司基的影響的；而最後，再看一看一個被稱作「近代文學之巨匠」的愛爾蘭人喬易土（J.　Joyce），在最近的十五年間究竟影響了多少人呢？</p>
<p>這種被稱爲「影響」的情形，本來是一種作家的工作過程中的自然現象，一般地説來，是有不到多大的驚奇的；但是不幸的是：在現今的我們這個社會中，「受影響」這一個名詞，似乎是被使用得太巧妙了，通常假如有人原封不動地從海外搬一點「野人頭」過來的話，這種情形也往往給稱作「受了什麽什麽大家的影響」的。在這種塲合，從實地説：「影響」這個名詞已經失掉它底來的意義，而僅成爲「無條件之摹倣」的「客氣話」了。</p>
<p>而這，雖然僅是一個語文上的虚飾與誤解（甚至就是一種錯誤），但是影響於作家的真實的發展却是不小的。往往平常多看了一點某人的東西，在寫作的時候有意無意地摹倣一點是也有的，不過如果就那樣不自覺地把這因爲看熟了一個人的東西而不知不覺（或者説是有意地）地寫像了某人的風格之作品的非惡意的摹倣也看成了受了某人的「影響」，這語句一下子就可以把在工作中的作家摔入女角尖裏面去；於是乎中國高爾基，中國柴霍夫……一個個的僞造的不成熟的「國貨」就層出不窮的出來了。</p>
<p>這對於被稱道的作家本身底發展上是没有好處的。</p>
<p>然而，假如真正地别受人的影響，却正相反地，非但不能阻礙作家底發展，而反能帮助他去開闢自己的天地，創立自己的獨特性。而且，前面説過，一個作家底真正受别人的影響，即使不能説是必要的，至少，也是他（作家）創作過程中的必然的現象，雖然是往往有連自己都不覺得的。</p>
<p>這裏就需要指出真實的「受影響」與非真實的「摹倣」之差别。</p>
<p>法捷也夫，在蘇聯職工會出版所的一次題目是「我的創作經騐」的演講中，就説了下面的一段話：</p>
<p>「假使某作家受他人的影響，到了接受其他作家的觀念和形式上的技巧，自然，我們把他呌做Epigonus（即完全重述自己老師而不創造任何新説之意）。假使一個藝術家成功高舉了現在的新資料，發展了某種新的觀念，以及在學習過程中受了較有經騐的作家的影響，這是並不奇怪的，因爲他在發展的過程中可以逐漸脱離那影響的。無疑的，我們每人，誰若是學習技巧於古典作家，他務須要去批判的研究他們作品的觀念上的內容和藝術描寫的形式上的方法。」（用「時事類編」三卷三期張仲實譯文）</p>
<p>這一段話，對於現今的我們是很有用處的，它非但指出了影響與摹倣（即文中所謂Epigonus的）的區别；同時，却更有意義地説明了作家受别人的「影響」的凖確的方法。「批判地研究别人作品的觀念上的內容和藝術描寫的形式上的方法。」這一點是每個作家所應當知道的「奥妙」。</p>
<p>而最後，法捷也夫也指明了真正的影響，非但不會像摹倣那樣的始終把摹倣者造成了一個巧妙的「僞貨」，相反地，却是能帮助作家去創造自己的特點的。</p>
<p>「他（作家）在發展過程中是可以逐漸脱離那影響的。」</p>
<p>説明這事實的例子也多得很：受了喬易士的多少新人都是依了自己的路綫而發展下去了，在司太因，福爾克納，與海敏威等許多人的作品中，你要找出像「優力栖斯」那樣的一部冗長暗晦的東西是已經不可能的了；而還有誰能在「毁滅」中找得出「復活」的遺骸呢？</p>
<p>唯有這，才是真實的可以説得上「受影響」；而也唯有真實地去接受影響，才是對作家有益的。</p>
<h3>蘭都不拉拔路上（續完）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>我們也把車子停下來。看見這個跌下去的印度人已經受傷了：在他的臉上和手上不住地流着血，（給碎石和荆棘割破了！）而口里的呻吟却是：「腰痛！腰痛！」（因爲跌下去的時候，貨包和車子正把他重壓着身。）</p>
<p>幾個孟加拉人把他們同伴的泥汚的貨包打開來，分載他的貨物，其餘的兩個便挾着他在中間，把三輛車子平行地踏起來。——這個受傷的人，是被扶掖着忍痛踏起車子來的。</p>
<p>「勇猛的孟加拉人呵！可憐在生活壓廹下底苦工！」我在心中呼喊着。</p>
<p>扣着我們的車也開走了，我更沈浸在一幅慘象裏面。</p>
<p>那是五年之前吧？我去峇眼地方看一個在小學時代的朋友的病。他被咯血症所剝蝕，瘦陷的眼眶和微小的語聲證明他的生命是要完了！</p>
<p>關於這個青年朋友的歷史，是可以寫成一篇動人的小説的：在小學畢業後，便跑到南洋找生活去。那時正是南洋的黄金時代，一個親戚在開布店，便照顧他每天從店里揹了一些布疋，深入椰林里向馬來人和中國婦人們兜銷。也彎起背脊負起重負，像駱駝般地從揹成百斤的貨物起，磨練到可以揹成二三百斤。於是積成一筆佣金，回家去還債和娶妻子。待第二次再南來，便碰着不景氣的惡運了。親戚的店子已經關門，現金辦來的貨品又没有銷路。早農把沈重的貨包揹出去、晚上又仍　　回來、所得的佣金既不够做自己的飲食費，而家裏的老婆又染着疫病死了！不幸的是一天在傍晚的昏眩的臘袋下，不留神跌進溝里去，被貨包把肺子壓傷了。待人家把他抬回來，醫生却宣佈他已經没有救了。</p>
<p>那天的下午他便死去，留着滿壺的血水在痰壺里，也把血汚染遍了牀布和身上的內衣。臨死的時候，還緊搯着蓋着的紅毛氈子，聲嘶力竭地喊：</p>
<p>「我的布包！我的布包！」</p>
<p>由於孟加拉人的慘劇，這幅慘象又在我的眼前顯現出來了。我聽見我的二十幾歳的青年朋友喊出人生的悲喊，我也看見一個大大的包裹在這個世界上向許多窮苦的人們底肩頭緊緊地壓下去壓下去，像要把這些人羣像螞蟻般被踐踏在巨大的脚掌下面。</p>
<p>我緊緊地閉起眼睛。我不敢再想了、一直到汽車「嗶」的一聲，和車夫宣告着已到蘭都不拉拔的時候，我才被驚醒起來，張開眼睛怱怱地下車去。</p>
<h3>人與書</h3>
<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>柳敬亨</p>
<p>由於吳偉業的一篇「柳敬亭傳」，稍稍談獵古文學的人，大概没有不知道這位説書的名家的。吳偉業固然把這個人物寫得活生生地躍在紙上，而云亭山人作「桃花扇」，也竟用他來開了塲，認爲是「人品高絶，胸襟洒脱，是我輩中人，説書乃其餘技。」這説書的確不是尋常之輩，常時人談到他的實在不少。最近買到王猷定的「四照堂集」，又看到關於他的兩則記載。其一是「柳敬亭爲左寗南寫照，而自圖其像於旁，識不忘也，予爲之贊」，有「辯士舌，將軍刀，白骨遇之，以枯以豪」句，對柳可謂推崇備至。吳傳亦提及柳自畫像事，可見敬亭不惟擅説書，亦會作畫。其二爲「聽柳敬亭説史四絶」，詩云：</p>
<p>一百年來一史臣，憑君哀樂轉傷神。高宗南渡無消息，惟見流傳説史人。</p>
<p>破賊當年事已非，猶存遺像説軍威。三韓銅柱多戲下，誰念將軍舊鐵衣。</p>
<p>百萬軍中托死生，孫吳知此笑談兵。千金散盡尋常事，不換盱眙市上名。</p>
<p>英雄頭肯向人低，長把山河當滑稽。一曲景陽岡山事，門前流水夕陽西（時説「水滸」一段）</p>
<p>這詩當然是反映了作爲遺民的王子一的深刻的悲痛。但柳敬亭説書的動人的力量，以及並非無所爲而説書，他所説的書自有其目的，是於此可見。余淡心「板橋雜記」謂「敬亭以譚詞，酒酣以往，擊節悲吟，傾靡四座，蓋優孟東方曼倩之流也，」頗足以盡之。又云：「寗南已敗，又遊松江馬提督軍中，鬱鬱不得志，年已八十餘矣。間過予僑寓宜睡軒中，猶説秦叔寳見姑娘也。」此爲承吳傳以後之歷史，而吳文未及者。説書神態，張宗子「夢憶」中所記，爲最能繪聲繪色者，所云「其描寫刻畫，微入毫髮，然又找截乾净，並不嘮叨，夬聲如巨鐘，説至筋節處，叱咜叫喊，洶洶崩屋。」以及「欵欵言之，其疾徐輕重，吞吐抑揚，入情入理，入筋入骨，摘世上説書之耳而使之諦聽，不怕其齰舌死也」，把敬亭説書的精神説盡矣。政治活動方面，自以吳傳爲詳。因校「説書」一文，想及「柳生」，便筆記之。</p>
<p>金瓶辯</p>
<p>把「金瓶梅」作爲一代的社會生活寫實來看，一般的説，是近年間的事。故對這一部書的理解，三百年來，是時有變易的。近來從事於維新運動一段的文史研究，收得當時的書報雜誌不少。於「新小説」中竟遇到三十年前對「金瓶梅」一書進歩的理解。其一，爲平子作，據序，此人係梁啓超之友人，意者即是平等閣主人。其文云：「金瓶梅一書，作者抱無窮寃抑，無限深痛，而又處黑暗之時代，無可與言，無從發洩，不得已藉小説以鳴之。其描寫當時之社會情狀，略其一班。然與水滸傳不同，水滸多正筆，金瓶多側筆；水滸多明寫，金瓶多暗刺；水滸多快語，金瓶多痛語；水滸明白暢快，金瓶隱抑悽惻；水滸抱奇憤，金瓶抱奇寃；處境不同，下筆亦不同。且其中短簡小曲，往往雋韻絶倫，有非宋詞元曲所能及者。又可徵當時小人女子之情狀，人心思想之程度，真正一社會小説，不得以淫書目之」。此種見解，雖仍不免有主觀意想之缺點，但其能另用一種社會的眼光讀小説，回退三十年，我們不能不承認是最進歩的理解。其二，爲曼殊作，他論及「金瓶」與「兒女英雄傳」兩書。其説「金瓶」，謂是：「吾見小説中，其回目之最佳者，莫如金瓶梅。金瓶梅之聲價，當不下於水滸紅樓，此論小説者所評爲淫書之祖宗者也。余昔讀之，盡數卷，猶覺毫無趣味。後乃改其法，認爲一種社會之書以讀之，始知盛名之下，必無虚也。凡讀淫書者，莫不全副精神，貫注於寫淫之處，此外則隨手披閲，不大留意，此殆讀者之普通性矣。至於金瓶梅，吾固不能謂爲非淫書，然其奥妙，絶非在寫淫之筆，蓋此書的是描寫下等婦人社會之書也。論者謂紅樓夢全脱胎於金瓶梅，乃金瓶梅之倒影云，當是的論。若其回目與題辭，真佳絶矣」。其見解雖不及平子，當對金瓶，的是能作進一歩觀者。此曼殊，亦是飲氷之友，不知即是蘇曼殊否？甚盼曼殊友人能以證之也。</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>和亞如來上海時，兩個人住一間屋，總感覺到東西太少，使用的器具缺乏，而且兩個人在一道生活着，漸漸也覺得有些平淡了，那時想：要慢慢製辦一些零星物件，譬如寫字檯，籐椅，水壺，茶具，花瓶，條箱等，一方面給自己使用，一方面也可藉此把屋子稍事裝點一下，説人少生活平淡，不妨再把母親接出來，添一個老人，定會免去一些生活上的枯燥的。</p>
<p>那時我們住在杜神父路，過三個月，要搬塲了，原因：一因爲原住屋子太破舊，二因爲新定好的房子既新且賤。新地址是福履理路。當時因爲東西少，連人在內一共三個黄包車就搬完了。</p>
<p>這以後，從福履理路又搬得巨籟達路，静安寺路，幾經遷移，還是没有在搬家上感受到多少困難，因爲我們的東西並没有增添多少。但是，時間慢慢向前過，和亞如同居已有二年了，兩人之外，竟然添出一個孩子來；不復是從前平淡的生活狀態了，一個小人兒，成天到晚吵吵鬧鬧的。同時，日用品方面，也增加不少，床，檯子，椅子，桌子，箱子，摇籃，還有一些零星用品，比從前多上兩三倍。可是，每天在習慣中生活着，向未注意到這些多出來的物件，一直到最近又要搬家了，難題也跟着生出來。</p>
<p>事先，同亞如商議僱車的辦法，黄包車，頂少也要八九輛，到徐家滙，起碼每部車要化上三角錢，再加上酒錢，三塊錢靠得住要化了，不上算。僱小車，三部許差不多，但小車價錢大，一部也要索價九角到一塊的，而且人還要跟着走，不上算。怎麽辦呢？現在我們真怨恨東西太多了。而且亞如竟然説：</p>
<p>「平常我叫你少買些用具，你偏不聽，怎麽様，現在知道麻煩了吧。」</p>
<p>她這話，其實是錯説了，錯的地方是她不該把東西多的責任硬把在我的身上，老實説，很有些東西是她呌我買的。我回答她什麽話呢？辯論嗎？没有用，就連她這報怨話也是無補於事的。</p>
<p>「説這些作什麽，想辦法搬就是了。」我終於還是回了她的話，同時，我像是又想到不該白受她的闖白，接着説，「不過到搬家時，不是你也常常説使用的東西太少麽。」</p>
<p>最後我們决定僱一輛搬塲汽車，因爲這樣一輛車既然可以連人帶東西都搬了去，不是走起來也快得很麽。</p>
<p>「真討厭，搬家，多麻煩的事情。」</p>
<p>亞如一面收拾東西，一面在報怨着。孩子又跟着鬧，鬧得你不但不能多作出事情來，反而把心情攪得亂糟糟的。</p>
<p>「我何曾不知道搬家麻煩人呢。」</p>
<p>我説着，繼續收拾東西，屋子裏竄起一片灰塵，地板上凌亂躺着一些破紙，破鞋和墨水瓶子。</p>
<p>我們爲什麽不搬呢。我們爲什麽要怕麻煩呢。一個月十三塊錢的房錢，數目不算少啊。現在搬過徐家滙去，那裏的二房東是多年的老友，房錢一項，數目既少，遇到手頭不充裕時還可以拖欠，上哪裏去找這樣便當的事情。</p>
<p>「不是搬了家，我們很有些借重，便當的地方麽。」停一停，我跟亞如説，「怎麽，你忘記了我對你説過的話麽。」</p>
<p>那天終於連人帶東西都搬過去，我們希望此「搬家」兩字不再在如活裏重現到面前來。</p>
<h3>嚮晚（十二）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>酒食開始了。四個人間，除國民文學大觀作者把抱着烟滔那些奢侈品，有損國民經濟不喝一口外，三個人差不多是滔缸和滔罎子。並在一起了。他們一杯又一杯儘不斷的喝着，他們底話也一串又一串地更多地談着。談到合意處，這一對娘舅外甥，又合拍地摇起頭來了：</p>
<p>『没有話説，没有話説。』外甥摇頭歎息，但還顯得幾分泰然。『我説過了。櫃子上進來的，却還是抽屜裏出去的多。門前的化子，比買主更多。開銷是少不了的，塲面是要擺的。上行！呵上行。做生意的，又那里怪得了上行。但我也不怪自己。説起來倒也有趣。爸死下到現在，錢也不全是我化了的。是氣數使然。要説我不會講生意經呢，我却也能見風使舵。但六七年來，總是—總是總是一個，「唉」字。祗有那一年，寗漢分家那一年，交了一交運，陳年古舊的東西，也當作時新貨賣了。一角錢的，要賣到頭兩元，甚至於十多元也難説—這一年是，是—唔，到第二年呢？唔！不用説，不用説，來來！你再喝一杯？再喝一杯！』</p>
<p>『還可再喝嗎？』黑眉挺了一挺。角瓜臉又裂開了一條大縫。杯子齊齊的舉起，『那麽你—唉！你李先生！來來！也再來乾一杯哪！』</p>
<p>喝着悶酒，不説話。李安已經有點飄飄然了。但也笑着接受了一大杯。</p>
<p>『好呀！痛快！痛快！將來吃你喜酒！』胡一元看李安這一付大家風範，舉杯子碰一碰李安底杯，説。『可憐這矮哥兒，還不曾在娘子軍裏掛一保名，當一名小兵呢？』</p>

<p>L&gt;談言</p>
<h3>國際反戰罷課運動</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>紐約電稱：美國信仰「自由」之大學生十萬人，頗有發生罷課運動之景象，藉以反對國內國家主義之傾向，及若干方面之軍閥態度，緣於「美國現有種種强廹國家陷於戰爭及泛擊主義之勢力」存在。且加拿大古巴阿根廷及智利等國，亦有類似之學生運動，凡他國學生贊成學生非戰會議計劃者，皆被邀請參加此項國際罷課運動云。</p>
<p>當然，在某種限度上，這一運動自以其所揭欒的反國家主義與泛擊主義爲標的，在希特勒墨索里尼正在宣佈全國學生須受軍事訓練的德政之後，這不能不説是「公理自在人心」的事件。這猶如歐戰爆發後，北京學生界曾起而作反對參戰運動一樣，至少可以使一部暴喝了爲政者「愛國」的揚州米湯，因而莫明其妙走入戰爭的人警醒。</p>
<p>戰爭這一事，到現在誰也知道是爲小部份人的利益，而將大多數人去犧牲，這一實况若被人們認識了時，便難以維持這一騙局。顯然這一騙局在歐戰中，已得了歷史的教訓，一方面曝骨沙塲造成許多孤兒寡婦，而另一方面則宴樂狂歡不用説，即所爭得來的祖國光榮「公理」勝利，亦不過徒增奴隸榨取之延續而已。反戰運動之隨歐戰結束而日益增長，即這種騙局的揭露所致。</p>
<p>所以不管希特勒恢復第三帝國的呌喊鎭天價響，墨索里尼羅馬帝國光榮的説教高唱入雲，然而一般人民撫今追昔，仍不能抹去他們血蹟殷然的創痕。但是他們却全國統一，號稱興盛，爲甚麽能够這樣呢？「泛繫」。泛繫可以説意大利軍隊開往非洲去征服殖民地，泛繫也能使薩爾人民在「德意志陣綫」脅廹下，宣告「民族」的勝利。尤其在大戰危機緊廹的現在，泛繫幾乎成了各國盛極一時的備戰武器。</p>
<p>但是這種泛繫的「軍閥態度」，固能暫時的把人類推向戰爭，同時也能將他們推向於反對戰爭，國際反戰罷課運動的興起，便是信仰「自由」的學生覺悟到戰爭不但不能使他們有利，且將蒙極大危害的表示，很顯然：要「愛國」，這愛國却非爲多數國民，爲自己。我們固不能希望由此罷課運動，便可使許多熱望於戰爭中獲取勝利品的「軍閥態度」轉變，要能使他們轉變，就只有一些因「愛國」而戰壕對壘的人們，覺得自己的敵人并非這些「丘八」，而爲另一些人，</p>
<p>反戰的罷課運動，應當對人們有這一啟示。</p>
<h3>亡命者之歌</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>（枯樹枝與小草開始在棕黑的中間透露了一星星的嫩綠，野麻雀也怱忙地在太陽裏打算起新的日子來了。人是不難覺察到的：又是一個春天來到了呢！</p>
<p>暖的氣流，暖的風，交錯地織成了一串顯着强烈的不調和的，難呌人忍耐的時日；好的風物與壞的情緒在心頭頑固地對立起來了，人昏亂得像給捲在旋風中打轉的紙鳶。</p>
<p>——這一串無窮盡的日子的鎖鍊啊！</p>
<p>然而，如今是：這鎖鍊是又拉着青色春天來了呢。）</p>
<p>從窗子裏吹來了一陣異樣的熱風，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>心是不由自主地抖動了一下；於是吃驚地跳了起來：又是一個新的，驀生的春天了阿！</p>
<p>便瞥了一下大鏡子裏的自己的影子：一切足以表示一個失去了歡樂的日子的標誌已經完全具備了，鬢髩上的灰白的星星，臉上的生活的硬線條，與瞳子裏面的失了神的暗淡。</p>
<p>感覺到日子的鎖鍊像條菲洲的大赤煉蛇，一天天加緊地把整個的生命盤住了；人給捆綁着像一個斷頭台前面的死囚。</p>
<p>感到的是重重的窒息呢：日子的鐐鎖是可怕的，日子的鐐鎖是頑固的啊。</p>
<p>於是，蒼茫地配着抖動的六弦琴，便低低地唱起來了：「在春天的小草面前，我是鐐鎖隊中的一個亡命者啊………」</p>
<p>聲音像碧　　裏的一綫游波的悠悠地飄向窗外的田野裏去了；六弦琴的尾聲中，雲在半空中緩綏地飄：一片，二片……</p>
<p>無數年青的日子是全化在客地的生疎的雲山中了，教給我以亡命者的方式的是許多書本上的珍貴的寳藏，與強頑的青春的活氣：於是在一代與一代間的不可避免的衝突中，冒着白熱的熖息，便流絘人那麽地飄出去了，把老年人底嘆息毫不動情地留在後面。</p>
<p>一些瑰麗的奇景便迎面地佈置在前面的世界裏了：恐怖，侮辱，飢餓與不安定，像北風中的雪片那麽地，跟着無窮盡的日子，連珠般迎面撲過來。</p>
<p>也曾從自己與别人的世界裏得到勇氣與安慰，　人生的不苦難是不值得憂慮的，牠們是年青人的鍜煉與試騐，在生命的悠長的路程上是寳貴的夜行燈呢。</p>
<p>把這些珍貴的語句牢牢地記憶着，便沉默地負着人世間的沉重的擔子，駱駝般地踏着粗糙的步子走過去。</p>
<p>彷彿每天拖着笨重鐐銬和那些未來的日子玩着捉迷藏的游戲似的，我躱藏着，逃避着，於是，日子像流水般地淌過去了。每個春天，當一羣新的日子在開始的時候，我終於不可免地感到一陣火熱，一陣憂急。到最後，美麗的希望的火花踉着眸子裏的青春的光暉一同枯萎下去了，人在生活的憂傷中老了起來，於是我開始懂得了：「我是個鐐鍊隊中的亡命者啊。」</p>
<p>於是，我便那麽安心地活下來了：亡命者是有着他一定的生活的方式的，生活的磨折是没有方法解除的啊。</p>
<p>而如今是：烏黑的髮絲也在荒疎的大鏡子中綴上了白色的星星了；明知道羨慕那枯草堆裏的綠色是不能算得聰明的；於是當黃鶯在對窗的枝頭驕傲地唱起來的時候，自己也不能相讓地把亡命者的燥音放進六弦琴的擅抖中來了：</p>
<p>「在春天的小草面前，我是鐐鍊隊中的一個亡命者啊。」</p>
<h3>沒落</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>源記號的老閭，二先生，坐在一只朝南的賬桌上，左手翻開賬簿一頁一頁的看下去；右手劈拍劈拍的撥着算盤珠。他小心翼翼的注意着算盤上的數目字，面孔上却像罩着一層嚴霜般的憂鬱。兩只手有些顫動，一對沒有神的眼睛，從那副銅架的老花眼鏡底下探出兩支懊惱的目光來，注視店門口的街上。可是街道上却冷淸淸的，幾乎鬼也捉得出來。再把目光移到櫃台上，正一眼看見學徒阿才爬在櫃台上打瞌　。</p>
<p>「阿才，你昨晚沒有睡醒嗎？大白天打起瞌　來，怪不得生意也完全給你打光了！」他彷彿店裏的生意不好，完全阿才打瞌　的關係，所以這口怒氣非要在他頭上出消不可。阿才給他這一叱責，忙把一雙烏黑的手在眼睛上揉了一揉，在眼眶上畫出了一個模糊的灰色圈圈，像小老風般的哆嗦到櫃台角落裏去了。</p>
<p>「咳！這年頭兒生意委實沒有做頭，上行的賬可少不來半毫，遲不得一刻，然而門市生意這般清淡，放出去的鄉賬却三成還收不滿。店裏貨物倒完了，但是錢却到那里去了呢？開了門沒有東西賣，還成什麽店？要添配貨物又沒有錢！况且今年上行聲明一律現批。不放賬呢，沒有生意上門，賒了出去呢，又收不回來，真難，難！」他一想到「難」，彷佛就有無量數的「難」字在他腦子裏出現着；甚至彷佛他的週遭全都是許多「難」字。他看到算盤上跟賬簿上，没有一處不是「難」字！他有些駭怕，猛可地把一本源記號的「總清」賬簿，恨恨的往地上一扔，劈力拍啦的將算盤上打成的數目一齊擾亂了；拍着自己的腦袋，倒抽了一口冷氣，斗的站了起來，跟着踱下賬桌，憤憤的向門外叮了一眼，自語着：</p>
<p>「嗎的，老子不要開這撈什子的店了！」</p>
<p>隨手捧起一隻水烟袋，阿才忙小心的掇上了個火吹紙。他一壁吸着烟，一壁腦子裏却在盤算着這店關和開的問題。他想，這片源記號開的第一年，就吃過用過，到年終一結算，還整整盈餘了四百多塊錢。到了第二年，給老婆生了一場大病，後來她又死了；所以店裏簡直白做，沒有多錢。去年第三年却輪着了這個年頭，虧的虧了，用的用了，吃的吃了，給人家欠的欠了，到如今店裏統統在內還不滿二百塊錢存貨。並且去年為了還米行裏那筆欵子，已向金生挪了五十元，每月要五塊大洋利息。我本來打算等年初五開了市，做下生意來還他的，誰知將近一個月快了，還不滿二十塊錢生意，店裏的貨又不能不添，怎麽辦呢！他想到這里腦子更加渾亂了，簡直不能够再往下想了。水烟袋也擱在手裏，已經停止了抽吸。</p>
<p>「關了吧！」呆住了許久，又對自己商量：「不，關了門鄉賬更難收取，他們也尤其好推託了。但不關吧！又眼巴巴的看着蝕本；生意沒有，放賬不敢，貨物没錢添，咳！」他這個問題實在難解决；關既不能，開又不好，召盤更没人要。想來想去依然像亂蔴一般的交織得他的心發痛。最後索性連水烟袋也望賬桌上一歇不抽了。</p>
<p>他坐在一只糖缸蓋上，雙手抱住了膝蓋，痴痴地里着門外，在這兩個鐘頭裏櫃台上就沒有一支生意上來過，門口雖也有幾個人走過，可是在他看來，都是討厭的面孔和模糊的影子，街中儘是靜悄悄的。</p>
<p>「難！」於是又有無量數的「難」字在他腦子裏打轉了！</p>
<h3>父</h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>春帶來了二月的柔風：</p>
<p>濃霧中的寂寞的小樓—彷彿修道一般的，六點鐘時候嚮起了鬧鐘的鈴聲，那個被精神病染斑了頭髮的爸爸，已經舒展着將要僵硬的四肢，從臥床上坐起身來。這種輕微的顫動驚醒了好夢中的兒子，一個高個子的有一對千鈞手臂的青年。</p>
<p>「爸，別時常留心着那些花吧，天還沒有亮呢」。</p>
<p>「是的。—今天是你媽底十年忌，我想到公墓去」。</p>
<p>爸吐着重濁的舌音。從他早衰的臉上已尋不出四十五歲壯年的威武，遲緩地下床，披了晨衣到那用一幅褪色綉花單子蔽着的衣樹裏，挾出一套過時的半新西服，像一個赴禮拜堂去結婚的情倡，謹慎地穿着起來，最後要兒子扣上了一條花色的領帶，就獨自兒踱到院子里去了。</p>
<p>兒子敏捷地整理完畢，在他爸枕畔挈了個錦綉的錢袋及一根籐手杖。他跳躍到院子的石級前，爸爸正捧着欄杆檐下的盆花送到每天陽光照耀着的牆下。</p>
<p>「爸，我來帮着搬罷」！</p>
<p>平時爸總摇着頭説：「不要！不要！我搬了許多年沒有打破過一個盆呢」！他是那樣顫抖地捧着盆花來回，而且為了兒子不聽話要生起很大的氣來的。—今天他沒有答話，仰起頭來端詳着天空：濃霧漸漸地消散了，那隱藏着陽光刺花了他的眼睛，或者特別興奮了的緣故，也覺得有些不舒服，咳着嗽在石級上坐定了。兒子就雙手托着二個地搬運起來。</p>
<p>「小心些，别摔破了！你媽最愛惜着這幾盆花呢」！</p>
<p>聲音是像母愛一樣的柔和。</p>
<p>開出院子的小門的時候，送牛奶脚踏車的鈴聲在這條石砌的小道上逝去。爸爸一手捧着一束花，扶了籐手杖，用着很快的步子向前走去，兒子要扶住他又不敢的樣子緊跟在他身後。</p>
<p>石道上嚮起兩個差落的皮鞋聲，在這淸朗的晨風中彷彿是　　　壯的音樂，兩顆跳躍的心，花色的領帶飄起在爸爸的肩頭。</p>
<p>守公墓的是一個精神閃鑠的老叟，他停了長柄掃帚說：</p>
<p>「我知道老先生今天要來的」。</p>
<p>「我們又老了一歲呵，你倒老健」。彷彿年青人一樣地拍着那個的肩頭，但是覺得自家的腿力不够似的倒退了兩步。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻」，他不自然地笑了，「遙遠的十年呵」！</p>
<p>幾乎是尼語　　　一干的向墓道走去，又是那樣快。</p>
<p>兒子高過他一個頭；並立在「亡妻×××」的墓碑前，頭沉倒在胸前，他</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>心中祈禱着：「十年了，我愛護着那些你心愛的花像傾愛一個年輕的姑娘！你瞧見你的兒子嗎，他亦是到了爸爸娶親的年紀了」？</p>
<p>他覺得交缷了一件重任。扣正了被吹起的花色領帶，傾視着細小的花朶在二月的柔風中向他頷首。</p>
<h3>離開了故鄉的雲天</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>「從别後，憶相逢，幾回魂夢與君同。今宵尚把銀缸照，猶恐相逢是夢中！」</p>
<p>人生來復的路上，在秋的客地；悵望着故鄉的雲天。黄花的季節，南國的薰風把她吹到了喧闐的上海。三日的逗留，陶醉在古老的夢裏。怱怱的，我們又朝着還鄉的路上。</p>
<p>但是呵，像午夜的夢境一顯！這些陳跡，又化成水泡了！對着都市的長空，悵望着故鄉的雲天。看到消老了的春光，我的心兒像離羣的孤鴈！一陣酸楚湧塞着心頭。</p>
<p>回想着舊的輪廓，祇有迷糊啊！大浹江裏的水，浮沉着我一顆歡愉的心；也載着我一個悲哀的軀幹。一年兩度的晤見，她的痛苦加緊着。故鄉也隨着古老的城牆，一年年的衰落了！像離絃的紙鳶，沒有邊際。像帶箭的斑雕，映着血痕。</p>
<p>在朝南的窗口，映着秋天淡淡的陽光。歡樂的魵圍裏，讀着每一册從上海帶來的雜誌。在整齊的抽斗裏，檢出一張箋兒；寄給在年紅燈下的朋友。歌頌着故鄉，永遠像在春風的懷抱裏。田園的風趣，戮乂我一顆放浪的心。掩卷沉思，她的臉兒；是展開了樂天的外形。</p>
<p>在後院落裏，金魚泅泳在平靜的水面。挺着對兒，像並肩的鴛鴦似地。花壇裏的菊花，展開了成熟的嫩黄。一陣空洞的秋風，古榕樹在沙沙地作着繁響。燒着捲烟，沉思在夕陽的影裏。</p>
<p>這一幅故鄉的輪廓畫，是跟着流光消逝啊！悵望着故鄉的雲天，有無限的愁思襲擊着我的身心。</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（七）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（七）好萊塢草創的開始</p>
<p>到了現在，無論誰提起了「好萊塢」三個字，他的意思差不多就是説「電影」。好萊塢和電影，差不多已是不可分離的了。但是很奇怪的，我們前此所講的電影，却都是電影没有搬到好萊塢以前的事實。我們現在要講講這好萊塢的原始。</p>
<p>好萊塢的發明，是和電影一樣，是件偶然的事。當一九一三年電影事業方興之始，各大電影公司，電影界的人物，都是集中或散居於紐約，詩家谷，華克蘭，斐拉德爾斐等城的。在落杉磯亦有幾家小影片公司，但是在那小小的鄉村，就是叫好萊塢的，那裏的人却很少看見開末拉，除非落杉磯的影業人，偶然到那裏去拍外景的時候。</p>
<p>「好萊」（Holly）本來是一種多刺的小樹，葉子是不平多刺的。到了冬季，它的葉子是常青碧綠的，並且葉子中間結着許多小的紅實，像天竹枝的紅實一樣的。它的用處就是拿來做聖誕圈。好萊塢的命名，就是因爲那裏都是生長這種好萊的樹林。好萊塢在那時，不過是一個地産的名稱，但是那些發明好萊塢可以作住宅區域的人，現在都成了百萬富翁了。</p>
<p>在那些人當中，直接和好萊塢的發明有關係的，就是一位羅伯勃隆登（Robert　Brunton）。勃隆登是一個蘇格蘭人，在影片公司裏做佈景師，油畫，木匠，都是他的善長。他跟着英國的名伶，亨利愛爾温爵士，一同來到美國。但是後來他對於電影却感到興趣，就没有跟他回去。不過他不久就失業了，因爲他的脾氣太不好，隨隨便便，過一天是一天的。有一天他出來散散歩，走到現在日落街的地方。他的脚歩停住了。他看見一大片的荒地，上面祇有幾間木棚似的房屋。他想起了曾在報上看見過，一家新創立的電影公司要搬到落杉磯來，還没有找到適當的地點。</p>
<p>你猜那幾個創立新公司的人是誰？他們就是半窮不富的傑賽拉斯基（Jesse　Lasky），近有一個薩繆高爾費希（「金魚」，後來就改名爲薩繆高爾温（Samnel　Golcwyn）了。）還有一個窮律師，亞塞弗蘭德。（Arthur　Friend）。這些人將他們有限的金錢，凑攏了來開設一家影片公司，並且僱了一個落魄的文人，呌西席地米爾（Cecil　B.　DeMille）的，做了他們導演，和舞台經理。那個時候，德斯丁法能（Du　tin　Farnun）在舞台上剛剛有些小名氣。他們就聘請了他來拍一齣影戲。</p>
<p>勃隆登心裏想起了這件事，他就立即跑到落杉磯的亞力山大客棧裏，去見高爾温。那時的人是少説話，多做事的人。勃隆登見了高爾温。開頭就是：「我已經替你找到一個再好没有的地方了。」高爾温亦是不喜歡多説話的人。他祇問了一聲：「地價貴不貴？」好萊塢就此造成了。</p>
<p>那片荒地和幾間木屋的價錢，是很有限的——不過幾百塊錢一畝而已——過了幾個禮拜，買賣就成交了。那新公司就叫拉斯基影片公司（Lasky　Studio）。這家公司後來造成了無數的明星，像華雷斯李德（Wallace　Reid）格羅麗亞史璜蓀（Gloria　Swanson）蓓蓓但妮兒（Bebe　Daniels）桃樂賽道爾頓（Dorothy　Dalton）等等，不過其中最著名的幾個而已。但是當時幾個創辦人在幾間木屋中開始工作的時候，怎能料到後來事業的偉大呢？</p>
<p>拉斯基公司的成功，漸漸引起了别地方影界人物的注意，大家開始向好萊塢遷移起來了。好萊塢的所以能成爲世界的影都，亦有天時地利的關係。加利福尼亞南部的氣候，是四季和煦如春的。日光，那時惟一的需要，因爲那時少用燈光，而是利用日光來拍片子的，在好萊塢是特别的鮮明，終年終日絶少陰雨的時候。以地利而論，好萊塢的地價甚廉。在紐約購置一畝地的價錢，在好萊塢可以購置好幾十畝。那裏木屋極多，木價甚廉，蓋造攝影塲費用極小，工錢比之紐約，不過一半而已。有了這許多便利之點好萊塢前途的發達，已是天造地設的了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「富貴春夢」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>King　of　the　Bitz—卡爾登</p>
<p>最近時期中，我們很少看到英國影片。現在卡爾登開映的「富貴春夢」，是以諷刺的喜劇的姿態而出現的。</p>
<p>這裏没有失却它的喜劇效果。它的作風，和好些英國喜劇一樣，决不過於輕浮，像美國的滑稽片那樣，而是保持英國一貫的莊重性，如一般人所説的帶着濃厚的紳士味兒，即使是逗人發笑的塲合也是如此。這種地方，應當是英國影片獨特的地方。但是也就因爲這個原故吧，英國影片便不爲一般看慣了美國影片的人們熱烈的歡迎了，雖然並不因爲如此便抹煞了它在電影藝術上的價值。</p>
<p>「富貴春夢」不是没有價值的，至少劇作者的企圖；不教小市民的旅館的侍役領袖向上爬，使他覺醒了富貴春夢，仍然回到原來的地方，仍然和同一地位的女僕結合，到底是較爲可取的。同樣，劇作者使帝王們傷感的回去，虚榮的富寡婦也到底和那打高爾夫球的結合，各歸原位，走出那矞皇的大旅館之門。但是劇作者在主要的現實性上却没有成功，至少是在技術上没有偉大的成就。</p>
<p>也許人們看到帝王懷着許多勛章在衣袋中，他隨時可以隨着一時的高興授封於人，也許人們對於那一羣華貴的男女，如跳舞師，如打高爾夫球的體育家，如風流寡婦，如帝王的隨員等人的醜惡，覺得諷刺得很有興趣，但是這中間就包含了不少非現實的表現，最明顯的是旅館的侍者偶然的身爲侯爵，以及男主人公在候爺宫邸的種種，都是使人不敢置信的，雖然這些地方都能充分的使人發笑。</p>
<p>因爲盧辟諾（Stanley　Luoino）的演技很好，在候爺官邸最後臨走的一塲，那酒醉糊塗的歌唱，情感甚爲豐富，這喜劇的悲劇地方，確有其若干價值的。他如女主角的淫蕩與虚榮，以及帝王的吊膀子的種種，在那一次三個男人同時訪問寡婦的時候，也是技術的優秀之處</p>
<p>不過整個的説來，這一影片的没有成功，還是不够技術的將主題表現出來，以致於始終成爲平庸的喜劇而已。</p>
<h3>亞父夏洛穆夫新作「香篆幻境」將公演</h3>
<p>俄國作曲家亞父夏洛穆夫，僑寓平津，踰十餘年，悉心研究中國音樂及戲劇，並尋求改善國樂與國劇之途徑，亞氏以爲中國音樂有極豐富之旋律，若作曲家取其精華，用和聲對位等方法，製成交響樂曲，則中國音樂在世界樂壇，亦可獨樹一幟，而與泰西先進諸國嫓美。亞氏對於改革國劇，主張從音樂入手蓋國劇與泰西歌劇相類似，必須有適合劇情之特殊音樂，方能免陳陳相因之病。亞氏欲實現其理想，故曾編歌劇演於美國，頗獲彼邦人士之好評，其交響曲及啞劇琴心波光，前年在滬表演，評者稱此乃改良國劇之先聲，亞氏近又編一啞劇名「香篆幻境」，共分三幕，情節離奇，音樂優美，表演者均係經騐豐富素著聲譽之中國伶人，由許姬傳楊玉樓二君導演，現已練習純熟，定於月之十三日起，演於卡爾登戲院，連演三日。該劇之佈景，爲杭州國立藝術院教授董拉屈夫所繪，音樂由工部局絃樂隊全體演奏，梅百器指揮，凡欲聆雅樂及欲以亞氏之作品爲研究改善國劇之參考資料者，幸勿失此良機，南京路七十八號魯濱蓀琴行，可預定座位。</p>

<h3>學童慈母（Grand　Old　Girl）（八）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>戴德連忙做着　無其事的，答應了一聲：「没有什麽事」，一壁將張報紙疊好了，塞到身子背後去，連聲説着：「没有事」。密司貝爾斯像一位教員，譴責一個作弊的學生似的，伸着手道：「拿來給我看」！戴德無可奈何的將那張報紙交了出來説道：「密司貝爾斯，現在不是看報的時候。「你何不等到……」但是密司貝爾斯早已看到了那一段新聞……她被教育局停職了……但却没有用停職的名目，而是用的長期告假的名目……並且她的後任已經派好了。她看了不覺呆下了。她的嘴唇顫動着，却説不出什麽話來。</p>
<p>戴德仔細看住了她的臉道：「密司貝爾斯，到裏面去坐一坐」。貝爾斯還勉强裝着笑容道：「不坐了，克拉倫斯。我没有什麽」。戴德安慰着她道：「長期告假……不是你還可以活動嗎」？貝爾斯道：「我不知道怎樣活動法」。戴德忽然替她害怕起來。他瞪着兩隻眼問題道：「密司貝爾斯，他們給你安排好了没有……我説的是錢的問題？你不是還有一筆養老金嗎」？密司貝爾斯眼看着前處歎了一口氣道：「我要做滿了四十年，才有養老金。現在，只有三十八年，可惜我年紀太輕了」。她笑着，笑出一種古怪的聲音來。她輕輕將戴德的手拍了兩下，就悄然走開了。</p>
<p>戴德亦替她覺得悽然，看看她走開了，自己説道：「年紀太輕了……」他的眼睛，又看在報上，現在看的是關乎總統的一段新聞。也忽然想出了一個主意……他想到了他幼時和他同級的「小姑娘」！他聳聳肩膀，挺挺胸，做出斷然决然的神氣。</p>
<p>明天的下午，吉莉跑到校長室來見密司貝爾斯。她臉上帶着淚痕，當校長伸出了兩臂將她抱在懷裏的時候。密司貝爾斯拍着吉莉金黄色的頭説道：「吉莉，不要緊的」。吉莉哭道：「這事太不公平了……我和我父親爭論了很久……但是他一些不聽我的話……他説事已至此，不能改變了……密司貝爾斯，怎麽辦呢」？貝爾斯道：「你不要管我好了……我是算不了什麽的……我已經老了……一切都完了，但是你……你剛剛開始……前途正長……吉莉，你知道嗎？你是一個天份高的人……有天才的聰明人」吉莉吻着密司貝爾斯枯乾的腮説道：「以後無論如何，我决不再做對不起你的事了……永遠永遠」。她説着，帶着一包眼淚走了。</p>
<p>在學校的門外，桑狄坐在他的卡車裏，很關切地時時看着學校的門。一回兒吉莉出來了。桑狄從卡車上跳了下來，將吉莉扶上了卡車，自己亦跳了上去，坐在她的身旁。吉莉的手伸進了桑狄的手中。她含着包眼淚望着桑狄，聲説道：「桑狄，從此以後，我再不裝假了。」桑狄看着她，柔聲説道：「我知道，你不會再裝假的了」。他伸過一隻手，扶住了吉莉的腰，一隻手將車開走了。</p>
<p>最後的一刻光陰，就是最悲苦的一霎那。新任校長已經來過了，商量怎樣接受的事情。梅立斯雖然對於老校長有些依依不捨，却爲飯碗問題，無法可想，可是柏資已經怒不可遏的走了開來，去綑舖蓋去了。最後，密司貝爾斯一個人留在校長室裏。平静……痛苦過去之後的平静……可是再無他望了。他望着牆上掛的一塊木牌，上面燙着：「見義而行——勇也」幾個字。她不覺頭低了下去，她禁不住眼淚的要奪眶而出，雖然她將眼睛閉得緊緊的（未完）</p>

<h3>Yang Hucheng Telegraphs Report on Bandit Suppression Progress</h3>
<p>[Xi'an] During the invasion of southern Shaanxi's Shangluo counties by the Red Bandit pseudo-25th Army led by Xu Haidong, the Sichuan and Shaanxi armies, as well as the National Army, launched a series of fierce attacks, almost completely annihilating Xu Haidong's bandits. Xu Xiangqian was defeated and fled back to the Sichuan border. All of Shaanxi province, except for Ningqiang, has been recovered. Yang Hucheng issued a special circular telegram on the 2nd, reporting the Shaanxi army's progress in suppressing the bandits. The original telegram briefly stated that when Xu Haidong invaded Shaanxi, Xu, along with Xiangqian, personally commanded his pseudo-4th Army. From February 11th to 25th, there were thirteen major and minor bloody battles in the area west of the Bao River, killing over two thousand bandits and capturing over two hundred. Six to seven hundred rifles and dozens of automatic rifles were seized. The bandits still resisted desperately, so the 49th Brigade Commander Wang Yiwu was ordered to lead two regiments of brave soldiers, each armed with broadswords and hand grenades, to flank the bandits on their left, deeply penetrating their lines and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Over a thousand bandits were killed, and our army also suffered over two hundred casualties. Hao Zuotian, the commander of the bandit vanguard, was also killed. The bandits' fierce momentum was thwarted, and they began to collapse. Our army pursued and suppressed them, and the 51st Brigade Commander Zhao Shoushan was ordered to lead troops along the south bank of the Han River, advancing in parallel. Wang's brigade successively occupied Niuzhai, Fanzhai, Niuxiangpu, Fengdushan, Huangshazhen, Jiuzhoupu, and Caiyuandu, and recovered Mianxian at 3 PM on the 27th. Zhao's brigade also successively occupied Xinji, Huangguanling, Hongmiaotang, Fuchuanzhen, and Yuandunzi, among other places. In this campaign, over a thousand bandits were killed, and our army also suffered over a hundred casualties. The remaining bandits fled towards Ningqiang. We are now working with friendly Sichuan and Gansu armies to encircle and suppress them, determined to wipe out these fierce bandits, who have been causing trouble for the party and the country for years, in the border area of the three provinces.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of Hebei Province, arrived in Beijing aboard the Jianguo ship at noon on the 3rd. He is scheduled to visit Chairman Lin and Premier Wang within days and plans to return north after staying for three to four days. Yu said that he had long planned to come south to present the local situation to the central government, but because political affairs in North China were frequent, he could not leave without permission. Recently, the deployments in various areas have gradually been finalized. At the end of last month, he went to Hankou to visit Chairman Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang to report on the local security situation, the reception of the war zone, and the army situation in North China. Upon arriving in Beijing, he will pay respects to Chairman Lin and Premier Wang, separately reporting on the situation in Hebei's politics, military affairs, finance, and construction. As for the reception of the war zone, it is progressing smoothly, and order is more stable than before. The security team is also working hard to maintain security, so the general situation in North China is relatively stable. Future plans focus on revitalizing rural areas and restoring vitality. Regarding water conservancy in North China, last year's Yellow River breach caused extensive damage. The provincial government has tried its best to provide relief but is unable to do so. This trip to Beijing will include requests for instructions on water conservancy reforms. Although educational funding in Hebei Province is difficult, the provincial government is determined to relocate to Baoding. Because the repair of the Cao Family Garden is time-consuming, it has not yet been realized. Once the repairs are completed, it will be relocated immediately. He will stay in Beijing for three or four days and then return north. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yu Xuezhong and his entourage arrived in Beijing from Hankou aboard the Jianguo ship at 12:30 PM on the 3rd. Staff members of the Hebei Provincial Office in Beijing and Yu's friends in Beijing went to the Xiaguan Wharf to welcome him. The Executive Yuan also sent Councilor Chen Rui and others to welcome him on the Jianggan. After Yu briefly exchanged greetings with the staff on the ship, he disembarked and took a car into the city to rest at the provincial office in Beijing. According to Yu speaking to reporters at the office, he went to Tianjin this time to visit Chairman Chiang and Director Zhang to report on the military and political situation in Hebei Province. Also, because he had not been to Nanjing for a year, he came to pay his respects to Chairman Lin and Premier Wang to report on the recent situation in the province. He will stay in Beijing for about three days and then return to the province. He continued to say that the most important matters in Hebei Province are resolving the war zone issue and repairing the Yellow River breach. The various war zone matters have been negotiated repeatedly, and progress has been made. The issue of the newly formed security team entering the war zone has been agreed upon in detail and can be dispatched once preparations are complete. Other unfinished matters are also under negotiation, with the goal of completely resolving them as soon as possible. The Yellow River breach caused severe flooding, and the people in the counties of southern Hebei suffered significant losses. The provincial government is very concerned about the breach and the relief of the victims. Director Hu Yuanhui of the Construction Department is still overseeing the filling and plugging work there. This time, he also plans to consult with relevant parties to obtain a unified solution. Because there are no traces of bandits in the counties of Hebei Province, security is currently very stable. As for construction matters in the province, due to limited financial resources, in addition to the North China Sports Field built in Tianjin before the year and the canal currently being built in Lingshou, which are relatively large in scale, the rest are repairs of rivers and roads. According to the situation last year, Hebei Province's finances had a shortfall of about one million yuan for the year. If this year's harvest is slightly better and some adjustments are made, there should be no problems. Regarding drug prohibition, Hebei Province is currently conducting it strictly. It is reported that Yu is scheduled to visit Chairman Lin and Premier Wang on the 4th to report on everything. (3rd Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Discusses Industry Standards</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Industry believes that Article 6 of the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law stipulates that a guild should be established for the same industry in the same region, limited to one guild.

However, industries with slightly different names, such as rice shops and grain shops, often separately organize guilds. According to the regulations of the Merchant Movement Guidance Outline, industries with similar natures and no different businesses should join the same name organization as much as possible.

<h3>International Perspectives on Loans to China</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the voices for Eastern cooperation have grown louder by the day, Western attention has also deepened. British parliamentarians frequently raise questions, and the U.S. authorities have also made statements. The League of Nations' Council, which was once sought but met with a firm refusal, now seems easily attainable. Truly, "A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." This is driven by the prevailing trend and vested interests. When matters reach a critical point, they cannot help but come forward with the desire to dip a finger into the pot and get a share. Britain, based on its good intentions to assist China, has proposed to the U.S., France, and Japan to provide financial aid to China. It is said that the U.S. has shown a concrete willingness to cooperate, while Japan seems to express its dissatisfaction. Currently, international competition is unusually complex. How will the situation develop in the future, and how will the powers engage in scheming for their own interests? We need not speculate about that for now. However, how should we receive the good intentions of our friends in the East and West? This is something that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>I have often said that one must be qualified to borrow money. For example, when the British borrow money from the Americans, there are no other issues besides the terms agreed upon by both parties. However, when the Chinese borrow money from foreigners, the reality is unlikely to be so simple. For example, the Cao Rulin faction's opposition to the Four-Power Consortium loan in 1920 was precisely to supervise our finances and open the door to international co-management. The reason why Eiichi Shibusawa's investment in China in 1916 aroused suspicion was that he wanted to use American money, channeled through the hands of the Japanese, to lend to us, which implied political motives. The situation is certainly different now, but whether the image of China in the eyes of foreigners is the same as what we see and believe about ourselves is a very important question. It is essential to prevent them from reverting to old habits, seeking the power to supervise under the guise of lending, or engaging in the reality of plunder under the name of cooperation. Politics and economics are nominally two but actually one, and they are inseparable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of borrowed funds is also of great importance. If used properly, it can revitalize the country; if used improperly, it can ruin the country. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. Therefore, the use of borrowed funds should be cautious. In the past, foreign debts were often diverted to political expenses or used to compensate for private losses. This should no longer be the case now. The funds must be used for production and construction, such as currency reform, to lay the foundation for economic revival. This is how borrowing can revitalize the country. However, there are often interferences from creditors when using foreign debts to run industries. First, it is conditional on hiring foreigners. Second, all materials must be purchased from them. Third, if managed properly, it is better than not doing it at all. However, cooperation with foreigners often involves paying huge salaries and only receiving a paper report. Or, due to a lack of understanding of China's national conditions, they may even forcefully implement unfeasible measures, resulting in half the effort and double the results, losing all the essence. It is difficult to say whether this is beneficial or harmful.</p>
<p>Foreigners should also share the blame for creating China's current situation of material scarcity. Foreign goods have long regarded China as their only sales outlet, and their sole purpose has been to extract money from the Chinese. They have destroyed its original productive enterprises without helping it with new construction, leading to the current state of financial exhaustion, where even foreign goods cannot be afforded. This is no different from killing the chicken to get the eggs. For example, the United States absorbs silver, thinking it can increase the price of silver and promote China's purchasing power. However, China's silver has long been exhausted from purchasing foreign goods. Even if there is any left, it is mostly silver in the vaults of foreign banks. Seeing the opportunity for profit, they disregard the dangers of the Chinese market and ship it out in droves, creating China's current situation of extreme austerity. Therefore, if the Chinese were truly rich in silver, the American approach would not be a bad one. Unfortunately, the Chinese are exhausted. Although silver is expensive and American goods are cheap, most people still have to look at them and walk away. The United States has gained little, but the harm it has done to China is significant. Therefore, if foreigners truly want to help China, they should abandon their extractive policies and consider the difficulties China is currently facing, reducing the factors that could increase its difficulties. On one hand, they should genuinely support production and construction that meet China's needs to increase the productivity of the Chinese people, which will increase their purchasing power for foreign goods. However, foreigners do not see this far. They only care about immediate interests, competing with each other and leaving no room for future development. If future loans to China are still about seizing power and extracting profits, it will not benefit China, nor will it benefit foreigners.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen once strongly advocated the international joint development of Chinese industries. His hopes for countries investing were: "(1) The governments investing must act together, unify policies, and form an international group. Use their organization, management talents, and skilled technicians to design in a systematic way and use materials accurately to avoid waste and facilitate work. (2) They must gain the trust of the Chinese people so that they enthusiastically help this endeavor. (3) That is, hold formal meetings with the Chinese government to discuss the final contract of this plan." In this way, "China can open a new market, which can sell its own products and also sell foreign products without interfering with each other." Although Sun Yat-sen's proposal was made more than a decade ago, it is still a principle that China should adhere to today. If productive enterprises can truly develop, then why would China's finances need assistance? There is always a solution. As for currency reform, it is also a form of construction and does not need to be discussed separately. We do not want to comment too much before it becomes a reality. What has been said above is merely expressing our views for the reference of our compatriots.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of Abdication by the King of Siam Published</h3>
<p>The Content and Wording are Very Simple</p>
<p>No Mention of Succession to the Throne</p>
<p>[London] King Prajadhipok of Siam formally announced his abdication today at his residence in Surrey, near London. His abdication proclamation was signed at 1:45 PM on the 2nd, and shortly afterwards, it was forwarded to the Speaker of the National Assembly of Siam by the Siamese Legation in Britain. The full text of the proclamation was released to the newspapers this morning by the King's Private Secretary. Its candor and simplicity of wording are rarely seen in abdication proclamations of emperors. The proclamation was typed on four pages, signed only by the King, and will be officially announced in Siam. The content informs the people of Siam about the general situation since the coup of June 24, 1932, expressing the King's deep desire to establish a constitutional government and his willingness to adhere to democratic principles. However, the conditions for his restoration, which he presented to the National Assembly, were rejected. Therefore, he had no choice but to abdicate immediately. The proclamation does not mention who will succeed the King after his abdication. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The King's Secretary stated to reporters that the abdication document consists of four pages and has been signed by the King, and will be officially announced in Siam. It mentions the conditions for restoration that were previously proposed. These conditions are based entirely on genuine democratic principles, including: (1) freedom of speech, (2) freedom of assembly for political parties, (3) the inclusion of provisions in the criminal law to protect the constitution, with political prisoners tried by ordinary courts, (4) amnesty for political prisoners, (5) the restoration of officials dismissed on suspicion of political activity to their original positions, and (6) the prohibition of active military and naval officers from participating in politics. The Secretary also stated that after his abdication, the King will use the title of Prince Sukhothai and travel to various places. He will temporarily remain in Britain until June of this year to settle various matters, and then he may reside in Switzerland. (3rd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The King of Siam signed his abdication document today. The King has repeatedly sought to abdicate because the Siamese Parliament restricts his power. Last year, representatives from Bangkok were sent to persuade him to retract his abdication intention. At that time, the King was still hesitant, but later hinted at letting another prince of the royal family succeed him. According to those familiar with Siamese affairs, if the King retires, the successor will be his eleven-year-old nephew, Mahidol, who currently resides in Lausanne, Switzerland. At that time, Siam will form a regency council to assist him in ruling Siam. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan and Siam to Adopt Cooperative Air Force Policy</h3>
<p>Air Routes Between the Two Countries Are Being Planned</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since Siam's withdrawal from the League of Nations, friendship between Japan and Siam has become increasingly close.

Japan plans to send a squadron of naval aircraft to Siam within this year for aviation festivities. The airship route between Tokyo and Bangkok is also being actively planned. The aviation base near Bangkok will be designed by Japanese naval and army aviation officers and engineers. (3rd, China United Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Purchase Large Quantities of Scrap Iron from Siam</h3>
<p>400,000 Tons Already Purchased</p>
<p>China United Press, Bangkok: It has recently been learned that a certain Japanese merchant has specially sent representatives to Siam to search for and purchase scrap iron. The representative has already arrived in Siam and has gone to the interior of Singora, Topee, and other places to purchase it, obtaining more than 4,000 tons, valued at 8 Baht per ton. It is said that the representative had previously come to Siam to purchase scrap iron, totaling 200,000 tons. This time, they have returned with the goal of obtaining another 200,000 tons. With such a huge demand, the market price of scrap iron in Siam will definitely improve. As for what the iron is purchased for, it is not known to outsiders.</p>
<h3>1934 Was the Worst Year for American Youth</h3>
<p>Moral Decline Reached Its Peak</p>
<p>The Ruin of Humanity Was Shocking</p>
<p>World News Agency, New York: Mr. Drake, Secretary-General of the YMCA in New York, stated in his 1934 annual report that this year was one of the worst in American history for American youth because they felt "unneeded in the world." He continued, "The full extent of the tragedy and evil of these young people may never be known, because the decline of the spiritual and moral qualities is subtle and invisible, difficult to quantify. Sacred scars are not revealed on the sleeves. However, the ruin of humanity is shocking, which is a fact." He also said, "This moral decline is the result of young people spending their youth in a war-torn world, followed by world reconstruction, unhealthy prosperity, and depression. But even if young people are reckless and irresponsible, we cannot but accept a large part of the blame. We must quickly seek remedies to avoid regrets. Although we are in this dark atmosphere, we can still hope that misfortune has reached its peak and that things will improve in the future."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Minister to Tour North China</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Hayashi's inspection of Manchuria is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on May 11, with an expected duration of three weeks. He will inspect Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Rehe. It is said that those close to the Army Minister have advised him to extend his trip from Rehe to North China and to meet with Huang Fu and other important figures in North China. If this is realized, when the Army Minister meets with important figures in North China, he can frankly express the Army's intentions regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, the Army Minister's visit to North China is highly significant. (3rd, Domei Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. Embassy Inquires About Hunting Conditions</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The U.S. Embassy inquired of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether it issues hunting licenses valid nationwide. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that our country's current hunting regulations do not specify the scope of hunting areas. The Ministry inquired the Ministry of Industry for an interpretation as to whether license holders could hunt throughout the country. The Ministry of Industry replied that the licenses held by people of treaty countries are Class B licenses. According to Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Hunting Law, the Class B hunting licenses issued by the Provincial Departments of Industry should first be sent to the local authorities in the hunting area to solicit their opinions. When issuing licenses, the hunting location should also be verified, and the licenses should not be valid nationwide. (3rd, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Cooperation to Aid China Difficult to Implement Currently</h3>
<p>Advocate Joint Implementation by Allied French and Italian Countries</p>
<p>Impossible for Japan to Completely Control China</p>
<p>[Washington] After Undersecretary of State Phillips met with British Ambassador Lindsay, he considered Lindsay's proposal for the United States and Britain to independently provide financial assistance to China to be in conflict with the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the 1920 International Banking Consortium agreement, making it difficult to implement. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, there is no possibility of assisting China at present. Lindsay immediately stated that if the United States and Britain disregard China, they would almost be entrusting China to Japan and allowing it to dominate. Phillips replied that China has a vast territory, and it is unknown how much difficulty Japan would encounter if it wanted to completely control it. As for the United States cooperating with Britain, France, Italy, and other related countries to assist China, it is not impossible. (2nd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Refuses to Comment</h3>
<p>[Washington] Undersecretary of State Phillips today refused to comment on reports from London that Britain would invite France, Japan, and the United States to explore the possibility of jointly providing financial assistance to China. At the same time, Phillips declined to say whether Britain was the initiator of this proposal. Phillips met with British Ambassador Lindsay yesterday to discuss the possibility of financial assistance to China. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Hopes for Joint Investment</h3>
<p>[London] People in authority of the British and American governments are discussing the matter of jointly assisting the Chinese economy in Washington. Well-informed financial circles here hold the following views: Britain has no intention of preventing Japan from providing financial assistance to China. If Japan intends to implement assistance to China alone, this adventurous behavior is not impossible. However, Britain has always hoped that, in addition to Japan, Britain, the United States, and France would jointly implement assistance to China. (2nd, Domei Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Relations Drawing Closer</h3>
<p>[Washington] The talk of Sino-Japanese amity has clearly brought about a combination of common interests in the Far East between Britain and the United States. Observers believe that although the news from Shanghai has not been confirmed, it is enough to make Downing Street and the State Department eliminate their differences. During President Hoover's time, former Secretary of State Stimson tried to restrict Japan's actions in Manchuria, but Britain failed to fully cooperate with the United States at that time. Currently, the United States also has difficulties because the Senate is quite disobedient to the President on domestic issues, which affects the government's handling of Far East issues. It is said that the simplest solution to China's current financial difficulties is to relax the U.S. silver purchase policy so that the price of silver no longer rises. However, the government is unable to implement this move due to the powerful silver faction in Congress. Although the Treasury Department has recently stopped directly purchasing silver in China, most of what is purchased in London is still Chinese silver shipped from Shanghai last fall. Silver experts here believe that the Treasury Department is buying newly mined silver within its possible range to avoid excessively absorbing silver in the Far East. However, in any case, the U.S. absorption of silver will cause silver prices to rise, and China will be affected. The government may be willing to reduce the amount of silver purchased, but if so, Congress may take drastic measures and pass mandatory resolutions, making it impossible for the Treasury Department to implement its current cautious approach.

<h3>After the Rebellion is Quelled, the Greek Government is Under Strict Guard</h3>
<p>It is said that a Part of the Rebels Retreated to the Island of Kydonies</p>
<p>Those Arrested Will be Tried by a Military Tribunal</p>
<p>Athens: The warships occupied by the rebels have already sailed to the port of Lagonisi on the island of Kydonies. Order on the island is normal, but the situation is not very clear. No clear news has been received here so far. The actual situation on the island should be clear today. The Minister of the Navy, Chatzi-Kyriakos, has recently resigned and been succeeded by Admiral Dousmanis. General Metaxas has been appointed as a minister without portfolio, and the Deputy Minister of Aviation has been promoted. According to the Athens News Agency, the partial reorganization of the cabinet is intended to consolidate its position, as Doumes and Metaxas have long been known for their prestige and will be able to calm the people. As for the attitude of former Prime Minister Venizelos, it is still a concern for the general public. The newspapers run by Venizelos and the newspapers belonging to the opposition party were not published this morning. The non-partisan Esbia newspaper asked the leaders of the opposition party to inform Venizelos of the real situation in the capital, so as not to act rashly. Martial law has now been declared throughout Greece. (Havas telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspapers here have published very detailed news about the Greek incident. Le Journal reported that the governor of Kydonies Island has been silent so far, and the island may have been occupied by the rebels. According to news obtained by L'Echo de Paris, the Greek government has dissolved the Senate because the Venizelos party has a majority in the Senate. In addition, a number of members of parliament belonging to the Venizelos faction have been arrested in Athens. (Havas telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Course of Events in Quelling the Turmoil</h3>
<p>Athens: The purpose of this incident was to restore former Prime Minister Venizelos to power. The government authorities had long been aware of this, so they were prepared at any time, and were able to quickly quell the turmoil. According to a statement issued by the authorities, the government had long suspected that some naval and army officers belonging to the Venizelos party, following the orders of General Plastiras, who was in exile overseas, were plotting a rebellion. Martial law is still in force, and the government is able to control the overall situation and prevent further incidents. A small number of rebels who escaped and boarded the cruiser Averoff, the cruiser Helli, and two destroyers are expected to surrender within 24 hours. This uprising was well organized and broke out in several places at the same time. Fifteen officers, following the orders of General Plastiras, entered the Efthymiou Barracks here and persuaded the troops to join the rebellion in front of the regular officers. After this army was confused and disobeyed the ultimatum to surrender, the unmutinied troops shelled their barracks. By dawn yesterday, the crowd surrendered, with three dead and twelve wounded. On Friday, the partisans attempted to occupy the Evelpidon Military Academy without success. Twelve officers led a hundred civilians into the school, detained the principal, and were trying to persuade the cadets to join the rebellion when the government troops arrived and drove them out. The same scene was played at the Perama Arsenal on the island of Crete. Rear Admiral Themistoklis led twenty-five active and reserve naval officers to launch an uprising in cars on Friday evening. The loyal officers of the cruiser Averoff had been tricked into landing in advance, and then the rebels boarded the ship and occupied it. The officers who resisted on the ship were detained. After the rebels occupied the ship, they were able to command the light cruiser Helli and three destroyers and three submarines. Therefore, the government artillery rushed to Perama and began bombarding the rebel ships at one o'clock yesterday morning, but because the distance was too far, they could not hit them. The cannons of the two cruisers were able to hit the town, so the houses in Perama were severely damaged. At four o'clock this morning, the rebel ships had sailed to the northeast end of Crete. Before leaving, the engines and gun positions of the three submarines and one destroyer had been dismantled, so these three ships and one destroyer were still docked in their original locations. The government sent several aircraft to attack the rebel ships. All the planes concentrated their bombardment on the Averoff, so the ship was hit by several bombs and suffered heavy damage. However, two planes were also hit by the ship's anti-aircraft guns, but fortunately they flew back to base safely. After the rebels occupied the warship, Rear Admiral Typaldos mediated. The rebels asked for half an hour to decide on their position. Half an hour later, they declared that they were unwilling to negotiate with the government and sailed away. Although the authorities strictly prohibited gatherings during the period of martial law, a mass rally was still held yesterday afternoon to oppose the revolution. The capital is now calm, with troops carrying rifles and machine guns stationed at various key points. However, public buses have stopped running, and all entertainment venues have been ordered to temporarily suspend business by the police. The newspapers of the opposition party have been banned from publication, and letters and telegrams are strictly checked. (Reuters telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Former Prime Minister Admits Involvement</h3>
<p>Athens: Former Prime Minister Venizelos, who is currently residing on the island of Crete, today formally admitted that he was of one mind with the rebels who attempted to overthrow the government yesterday. The government has ordered a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to the next morning, and has organized a military tribunal to try the arrested rebels. The government has decided that if the rebel ships do not surrender by tomorrow, it plans to bombard them fiercely with the Greek Air Force. There are currently three bombers, fully loaded with bombs weighing 200 pounds each, waiting for orders to depart. According to the commander of the air force, the cruiser Averoff fired a hundred times at the planes yesterday, but none hit. The rebel ships also fought the planes with machine guns. General Plastiras, who is currently residing in Cannes, denies any involvement in this rebellion. Today, he told a Reuters reporter that he knew nothing about the domestic turmoil except for reading the newspapers. He also said that he did not want to leave France at the moment, and that the recent developments in Greece were not surprising, as he believed that half of the country opposed the current government.

<h3>British Government Invites Former Prime Minister Lloyd George to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>[London] The move by the National Government to invite former Prime Minister Lloyd George, the leader of the Liberal opposition party, to come out of the mountains and cooperate has been regarded as interesting by political and parliamentary circles, and has been commented on one after another. In the past three months, Lloyd George has expressed fierce opposition to the chaos of the economy, finance, and society, and has advocated the adoption of a controlled economy to remedy it. Although the proposed plan is large in scale, it is also too broad. The National Government has invited him to join the cabinet at this time to show respect and to urge him to try his hand and not to be satisfied with passive opposition. As for Lloyd George, he replied that he opposed all the government's current work, and that the effective measures for economic recovery were not limited to those proposed by individuals. All those who are helpful to this undertaking, no matter where they come from, should be considered. The best way is to organize a parliamentary committee to conduct research.

<h3>Lloyd George Writes an Article Advocating British-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>[London] Liberal Party leader Lloyd George, who was the British Prime Minister during the European War, published an article in the Weekly Illustrated, stating the absolute necessity of maintaining a common policy between Britain and the United States in dealing with the Far Eastern question. George recalled the commercial reflections of the spread of Japanese power throughout Asia, saying that once China was under Japanese command, the open door would never exist, and the valuable Chinese market would be lost forever. We should aim to obtain a Far Eastern solution that takes into account the best interests of China, Japan, Britain, and the United States. Neither Britain nor the United States can hope to achieve any success alone in achieving this goal, but if Britain and the United States cooperate, they can guarantee that the development of China and Japan will become a harmonious factor in world progress.

<h3>Simon Eden to Arrive in Berlin on the 7th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The German Government Plans to Treat Him as a Guest of Honor</p>
<p>There is a Saying that the Trip to Moscow Will be Postponed</p>
<p>[Paris] According to news from London received by Le Matin, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on the evening of the 7th, i.e., Thursday, and hold talks with Chancellor Hitler on Friday and Saturday. As soon as the work is completed, they will return to their country. During this period, the British government may be able to find a way for the Foreign Secretary to go directly to Moscow and Warsaw from Berlin, or even to the Czech capital. Le Echo de Paris, on the other hand, said that British Prime Minister MacDonald was very moved by the fact that the direct negotiations between Britain and Germany should not give rise to any side issues, and that he believed that Foreign Secretary Simon should not make a trip to Moscow immediately. Therefore, the decision to hire the Russian Foreign Secretary was postponed. (Havas telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon is now scheduled to come to Berlin on the 7th of this month to discuss with the German authorities the proposals put forward by Britain and France on February 3.

<h3>British Publishing Authority Agrees with Simon's Visit to Russia</h3>
<p>Welcoming the Soviet Union's Efforts for Peace</p>
<p>Forming Mutual Security Groups</p>
<p>[Moscow] The London correspondent of Pravda spoke with Stead, a famous British publishing authority. Stead said that in the issue of building peace, it is necessary for Britain and the Soviet Union to have direct consultations. He has always agreed with the idea of forming mutual security groups. It is precisely for this reason that he sincerely welcomes the Soviet government's recent explanatory memorandum on its attitude towards European security issues. Stead also said that he does not sympathize with communism, but he welcomes the Soviet government's efforts for peace. At a time when the "Rosenberg faction's" planned aggression is threatening international peace, "the British Foreign Secretary's trip to Moscow is extremely important. British public opinion warmly supports this move. If the purpose of this trip is to obtain real security in Eastern Europe, rather than to complete some unstable compromise, then this trip will not be in vain. I hope that the Soviet Union will not agree to the compromise."</p>
<p>Pravda has an article entitled "It is Facts, Not Words, That Decide," commenting on Stead's remarks: "This conversation proves again how important the Soviet Union's position is in international politics and in the struggle for peace. Although Stead does not sympathize with communism, he has to admit that the Soviet Union is a pillar of peace, as facts have fully proved. Although we dare not agree with Stead's political views, we sincerely hope that Britain can use actual facts to convince us, as we already have such facts." (TASS telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Rebels Arrested in Vienna Incident Last Year Sentenced</h3>
<p>Former Austrian Ambassador to Rome Detained for Questioning</p>
<p>[Vienna] Seventeen members of the National Socialist Party who participated in the rebellion last July were charged with smuggling explosives and were sentenced to death by the Salzburg court today. These seventeen people boarded a yacht on July 31 last year and loaded explosives, planning to transport them from Germany through Lake Constance in Switzerland into Austria. However, the Austrian government received a secret report in advance and sent troops to ambush and wait. When the explosives were unloaded, they surrounded them. Except for four people who escaped on a yacht and were later arrested by the Swiss authorities, the rest were arrested on the spot. The Swiss government protested to the German government about this matter. (Reuters telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Former Austrian Ambassador to Rome Lintlern was detained for questioning on charges of high treason in connection with the National Socialist rebellion last July. Today, public prosecutor Dr. Du Bi requested that Lintlern be sentenced to life imprisonment after the witnesses had made their statements. However, Lintlern pleaded not guilty. It is reported that after the National Socialist members occupied the Prime Minister's Office last year, they announced the dismissal of former Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss by radio, and the news that Lintlern would succeed him. When the national army quelled the rebellion, Lintlern was arrested and attempted suicide but failed. Lintlern was still ill and had three doctors standing beside him during the interrogation today.

This team paraded through the streets, with the military flag leading the way, and was very popular with the people. Military Commander Dashte Asia addressed the officers, saying that although the goal of the Italian army going to Africa forty years ago was no different from today (in the Italian-Abyssinian War in 1869, the Italian army was defeated), the Italian people are now united externally and wholeheartedly support the army, which is very different from the past.

<h3>British Pound Continues to Fall, Currency War Not Over</h3>
<p>The Rise in Silver Prices Affects the Chinese Economy</p>
<p>The Way to Remedy Lies in Financial Assistance</p>
<p>[New York] The British pound fell to $4.78 against the US dollar (equivalent to one pound). American people are again concerned about the currency war, and they are paying attention to the current difficulties and political uncertainty in the British economy. American conservatives originally believed that the British government had achieved economic recovery without intervening in the economic and social aspects, and they were envious. However, since the continued fall of the pound, people in the financial world have begun to doubt the reality and scope of British economic recovery. Famous reporter Lippmann published an article in the New York Herald Tribune, saying that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, are most concerned about the move to control prices, but now they cannot cooperate, which is a pity. Is "financial peace" so illusory and unpredictable? Regarding the gold issue, until now, the general public originally thought that the US government would not raise the price of gold, but the actions of the inflationists in the current session of Congress have been enough to embarrass the government. Now that the pound continues to fall, these people are even more eloquent. In addition, the continuous rise in silver prices is enough to affect the economic situation in China. The way to remedy it lies in financial assistance. However, Congress and national public opinion do not first lend to foreign countries. Although the US government wants to assist China so that it will not be manipulated by Japan, it also feels difficult to do so. In short, Congress firmly advocates raising silver prices, which is also to lend the treasury's silver reserves to China. But if the country is lent US dollars to purchase silver on the international market, and the market price of silver will increase even more, then it should be discussed separately. (Havas telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>US Inflationists Advocate Banning the Export of Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>[Washington] Summers, a Democratic member of Congress and chairman of the House Currency Committee, who has always advocated raising silver prices, recently launched another offensive, announcing the preparation of a bill advocating a complete ban on the export of gold and silver, including those exported for international payments. If so, the US dollar will be completely separated from gold and silver. According to Summers, the current US method is not completely satisfactory. The 125 members of Congress's Silver Group, who advocate the inflationist faction, will meet in the middle of next week to discuss the overall monetary issue and draft a bill to allow the government to purchase silver at a price of $1.29 per ounce (the current market price of silver is about 50 cents per ounce). Government officials heard about Summers's declaration and again stated that the government had no intention of changing its current monetary policy. (Havas telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Glimmer of Peace in Southern Europe, Improvement in Italian-Yugoslav Relations</h3>
<p>[Rome] The situation of easing diplomatic relations between Italy and Yugoslavia has now shown an increase.

In the future, one of the most turbulent corners of Europe will have real progress in peace guarantees." (Havas telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Ministers of Justice and Interior Resign</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The Gömbös cabinet seems likely to be reorganized immediately, and there is a possibility of a collective resignation. According to reports, Minister of Justice Haczar and Minister of Interior Fischer have both resigned. Fischer, the Minister of Interior, was originally a political friend of Count Bethlen. When Count Bethlen clashed with Prime Minister Gömbös two months ago, he had already decided to resign. Later, because the League of Nations was discussing the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary, Hungarian internal affairs should not cause disputes at that time, so he delayed submitting his resignation until today. The newspapers believe that Fischer's letter of resignation will be submitted at the State Council meeting tomorrow morning. As for who will succeed as Minister of Interior, the current Minister of Agriculture Daranyi is the most popular. (Havas telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese-Puppet Regime Expansion of Air Transport Plans</h3>
<p>Eager to Link Japan, Korea, Soviet Russia, and Puppet Organizations by Air</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: In order to strengthen its air force and expand its transportation business, Japan is now actively promoting an expansion of its air transport plans through the Ministry of Railways. Currently, the air routes for this plan are as follows: (1) From Tsuruga to Vladivostok, connecting with the Siberian Railway; (2) Japan-Korea-Manchuria connection between the mainland and Hokkaido-Sakhalin, and between Osaka-Keijo (Seoul)-"Hsinking" (Changchun). This air transport will be managed by the Ministry of Railways and will not be related to the Japan Air Transport Company. The principle is "Safety First," using the world's best aircraft. Overseas offices have already been instructed to investigate the achievements of air transport operated by railways in the UK, the US, and Germany. At the same time, in addition to expanding the "Manchurian Aviation Network," regular passenger transport, and air postal services, which are already completed, it has recently instigated the puppet organization to start negotiations with the Soviet Union, hoping to realize Eurasian intermodal transport. This matter was raised when Ito, a postal affairs official of the Harbin Postal Administration, visited European countries in 1933 to introduce the puppet state's postal services, but no response was received from the Soviet side. This time, the puppet organization's Ministry of Communications, taking the view that postal services are a product of human welfare, wants to negotiate with the Soviet Union again, hoping to reach an agreement. The Soviet Union's regular aviation is operated by the state, with air routes between Moscow, Chita, and Vladivostok. The Japanese-puppet regime's plan is to extend the Soviet regular air route from Chita to Bolshaya Ulya along the Zabaikalsk Railway line, and hopes to implement air intermodal transport and exchange mail between Manchuria and Bolshaya Ulya. If this connection is realized, mail from Tokyo to Moscow, which previously took four weeks, can be delivered in just one week, opening a new era of change in Eurasian air transport connections. It is also heard that the Japanese Ministry of Railways convened a meeting of relevant authorities on February 22 with aviation liaison officers to achieve this goal. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Goes to Sichuan to Supervise the Suppression of Red Bandits</h3>
<p>Optimistic Outlook for the Total Collapse of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Wuchang Headquarters was officially established on the 1st, and a Chairman's Adjutant Office was set up, directly under two departments, each with three groups, which have also been organized. Operations began on the 2nd. The first department head is Yan Daogang, the first group manages general affairs, group leader Xiang Chuanyuan, the second group manages intelligence, group leader Yan Daogang concurrently, the third group manages security, group leader He Yun. The second department head is Chen Bulei, the fourth group manages confidential matters, group leader Mao Qingxiang, the fifth group manages research and design, group leader Chen Bulei concurrently, the sixth group manages editing and reviewing, group leader not yet determined. After completing the rear area arrangements, Chiang took a Ford aircraft from the Wangjiadun Airport in Hankou at 10:00 AM on the 2nd to go to Sichuan, accompanied by department head Yan Xunfu, secretaries Mao Qingxiang and Wang Rizhang, and guard captain He Yun, four people in total, in two Fokker-Wright aircraft. Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, and Ye Peng all came to the airport to see him off. Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling took the Yong Sui warship west. Around 11:00 AM, the aircraft arrived in Yichang, and Chairman Chiang disembarked for a short rest, then continued flying west, scheduled to arrive in Chongqing at 3:00 PM. Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, and He Guoguang, Director of the General Staff of the Headquarters, are waiting in Chongqing, and have telegraphed all generals to quickly gather in Chongqing to meet and receive instructions. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Li Qixiang, Yang Sen, Tang Shizun, and Liu Bangjun set off from their defense areas that day, and will arrive by the 4th. Wang Jialie also decided to take a plane to Chongqing to meet and request instructions. It is heard that Chairman Chiang intends to inquire in detail about the progress of the suppression after all the generals arrive in Chongqing, in order to provide instructions. He will also make overall plans for military expenses, transportation, and communication for the front-line troops. The date of his return to Hankou has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>The military situation of bandit suppression in various provinces is becoming increasingly smooth. Zhu Mao and other bandits previously fled to Yunnan, intending to invade western Sichuan to rest and recuperate. They besieged Weixin and Zhenxiong for five days without success, and then fled back to Sichuan and Guizhou. They are now being pursued by the Yunnan army and intercepted by the Sichuan and Guizhou armies, confined between Tucheng and Chishui. Although there are still many bandits, as long as they are not allowed to establish a foothold, it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The remaining bandits of He and Xiao in western Hunan were trapped in Dayong, and broke out in different directions towards Cili, Yuanling, Chenzhou, and Yongshun, and are being surrounded and suppressed by various bandit suppression units, and a complete clearance is imminent. However, the Xu and Zhang bandits in northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, after a long period of rest and preparation, are still formidable enemies. The bandits who entered Shaanxi, led by Zhang Guotao, repeatedly failed to attack Nanbao and have now retreated to the south of the Han River. Sun Weiru's troops have been divided into routes to pursue and suppress them. The bandits remaining in Sichuan, led by Xu Xiangqian, defend Wangcangba in the west and Xiaochangba in the north. Wangcangba is a strategic point in Nanjiang, defending it to secure their old base. Xiaochangba connects to Bikou and Qingchuan, occupying it to plan other escapes. The bandit's previous front line was from east to west, but now it has changed to from south to north. The Sichuan army units will be divided into left and right wings to attack Wangcangba, in order to join forces in Nanjiang and cooperate with the armies of Gansu and Shaanxi. Observing the overall situation, it is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi have been meeting with Chairman Chiang for several days to discuss various funding issues and reorganize Sichuan's finances, and concrete measures have been decided. On the morning of the 2nd, after Chairman Chiang went west, Song and Kong also took a Minsheng warship back to Nanjing in the afternoon. Song's trip to Sichuan will be decided after he arrives in Nanjing. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Suspends Advance Collection of Land Taxes</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Telegraphed That Land Taxes Will Be Collected Once a Year</p>
<p>Goods Passing After One-Time Tax Payment Without Obstruction</p>
<p>All Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: The Sichuan Provincial Government Office in Nanjing recently received two telegrams from Chairman Liu's secretariat to the county magistrates, collection bureau chiefs, and the people of Sichuan, formally announcing that from 1935 onwards, land taxes in Sichuan will be collected once a year. During the bandit suppression period, a temporary military fee will be attached to the land tax amount once, and no other collections will be allowed. As for goods, after paying taxes once, they will not be taxed again anywhere in Sichuan, regardless of where they are transported. This is the first major policy of the provincial government after its establishment and is expected by people across the country. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram 1</p>
<p>To all county magistrates and collection bureau chiefs in Sichuan: Our country is based on agriculture, and land taxes are collected once a year, meaning that agricultural land and tax revenue should correspond. During peaceful times in the past, the principle of never increasing taxes was always followed. Unfortunately, Sichuan has frequent military affairs, and the needs are vast, resulting in advances and pre-collection, which has become a habit, causing suffering to our people, which is a constant source of remorse. This chairman has been entrusted with a difficult task, originally hoping to start anew with the people. Land taxes should be restored to the old system, but the bandit atmosphere has not been quelled, and military affairs are ongoing. If the people are to enjoy their work, they must first live in peace. However, if we try to reduce taxes and get closer to the people, it will greatly affect the military. Therefore, based on the principle of choosing the lesser of two evils, we have decided on a policy of gradual improvement. It is now decided by the provincial government meeting that land taxes in all counties of Sichuan will be collected once a year from 1935 onwards. Before the military is reorganized, a temporary military fee will be attached to the annual land tax amount, and no other advances or pre-collections will be allowed. As for the time and procedures, the collection bureaus should carefully consider the local situation, strive for simplicity, and prevent disturbances. Once the bandit troubles are eliminated and the troops are reorganized, it will be stopped immediately. I hope that all the elders and brothers of Sichuan will share the difficulties, strive to relieve the local difficulties, understand the government's difficult situation of considering all aspects, know the seriousness of the mission of the times, endure temporary pain, and plan for permanent peace and tranquility. After this regulation, all collection personnel must be honest and upright. If there are any violations of the law, tricks, or self-interest, once the government finds out, or the people report and it is verified, they will be punished according to the law and will not be tolerated. In addition to sending telegrams separately, the county and bureau should immediately comply and post notices to inform the public, showing the government's concern for the people's suffering, and report the compliance situation for future reference. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, East (1st day)</p>
<p>Telegram 2</p>
<p>Tax revenue principles should be fair and universal, and the tax system must be unified in order to protect production and cultivate tax sources. In Sichuan, there are many tax revenue items in each county, and numerous bureaus and checkpoints. Merchants and traders are obstructed and detained, and officials exploit and harm them, resulting in a decline in all industries and widespread hardship. If we do not make efforts to rectify this, how can we save the people's livelihood? This chairman was ordered to reorganize the provincial government and deeply considers the state of the market and cherishes the concerns of the merchants. Therefore, after a meeting, it was decided to simplify the various county taxes and set up local tax bureaus. All merchant goods, after paying taxes once, will not be taxed again anywhere in Sichuan, regardless of where they are transported. In addition, all old excessive and miscellaneous taxes will be abolished to avoid disturbances. In addition to determining the tax rules, another order will be issued for implementation. The compliance situation should be reported. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, East (1st day)</p>
<h3>Financial Situation of Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>The Provincial Bank's Business Improves</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The financial situation in Shanxi Province, since Yan Xishan used his authority as the military governor and provincial governor to expand the scope of the Shanxi Official Money Bureau and reorganize it into the Shanxi Provincial Bank in 1917-18, all public funds in the province have been exclusively managed by the bank. Since then, the financial power of Shanxi Province has been concentrated in the bank. By 1930, the bank's banknotes had been issued to more than 60 million yuan. At that time, except for a small amount of silver dollars circulating in the southern part of Shanxi, most counties in the province relied on provincial banknotes for turnover. Later, due to political changes and the provincial bank's depleted reserve, the price of provincial banknotes plummeted again and again, and the people were miserable. When Yan Xishan returned to power again, he stipulated that 20 yuan of provincial banknotes could be exchanged for one silver dollar, and then cleaned up the mess, started anew, and reissued new banknotes for circulation. In the past three years, although the financial situation of the province seems to have gradually recovered, the vitality has been greatly damaged and cannot be recovered in a short period of time. In recent years, many new banks and money houses have been added in Taiyuan, but most of them are public enterprises run by the government. If the silver houses and money shops organized by the business community, they have all suffered a setback and are in a state of decline. It is found that the silver houses and money shops organized by the business community are mostly reorganized from the old exchange houses, which were also a special skill of the Shanxi people in the past. During the prosperous period of 1930, there were more than 60 such businesses in Taiyuan alone, and they were all thriving and profitable. In the past one or two years, they have closed down one after another, and more than half of them have already closed. Even those that remain are barely maintaining the status quo. The Bank of China used to have a branch in Taiyuan, facing off against the Shanxi Provincial Bank. Later, due to poor business, it was changed to a sub-branch, and then changed to an office. In fact, it is just a matter of maintaining appearances. In addition to the Shanxi Provincial Bank, there are still several public silver and money businesses, such as the Suixi Reclamation Bank, the Railway Bank, and the Jinbei Salt Industry Bank. In recent years, the provincial bank has been reorganized by the bank manager Zhi Xiang, and it made a profit of more than 400,000 yuan last year. If it can continue to work hard and not be affected by political affairs, then the future business has a good prospect for development. However, Wang Xiang has been ordered by the central government to be transferred to the director of the Department of Construction. The position of general manager of the provincial bank that he left behind is being sought by the authorities. The internal affairs of the bank are temporarily maintained by the manager Fu Jianxi. Wang reported to the authorities in detail about the bank's design, business and expenses last year. Because the rise and fall of the provincial bank is very important to the overall financial situation of Shanxi Province, the report is attached as follows:</p>
<p>Design Aspects</p>
<p>(A) Domestic: When the bank was reorganized in 1932, due to environmental and financial reasons, nine domestic branches were abolished. Now, the credit has gradually recovered, and the capital has been changed from 66 million yuan to 12 million yuan according to the actual needs of economic construction. 100,000 yuan will be allocated every month, and it has been allocated on a monthly basis since July last year. In order to regulate the financial situation of the province, it is advisable to set up branches, so that the province's financial networks can be gradually connected. However, setting up branches all over the province will result in huge expenses, which will inevitably be unaffordable. Therefore, we have followed the example of the Bank of China and set up more consignment shops and fewer branches. In fact, it can achieve considerable results, and in terms of expenses, it can avoid unnecessary expenses. Proceeding in this way seems to be more beneficial and less harmful. Therefore, last year, the Tianjin branch was changed to a consignment shop, the Fancun office had simple affairs and was merged into Taigu, and Kelan, Hequ, Xixian, and Lishi were all changed to consignment shops, and more staff were sent to carry out the work. In addition, three consignment shops were added in Wenshui, Jiexiu, and Shouyang, and it is planned to add more consignment shops this year in places with slightly more commercial activity, in order to achieve the goal of universal coverage. (B) Foreign: Exchange is the most important part of banking business. Since the reorganization of the bank, only two foreign business offices have been retained in Tianjin and Suiyuan. It is often felt that the exchange and transportation of goods to major commercial ports outside the province are stagnant and difficult to communicate. It is also an important task for the bank to act as an agent for the treasury and collect public funds from various counties. Wang believes that if a flexible method of exchange is not properly planned, it will not only be inconvenient to use, but also the transportation costs will be a waste. The source of hard currency in the province is examined. In addition to the border counties exchanging food, coal, and local products for goods from other provinces, most of them are exchanged for cotton and salt from southern Shanxi and transported into the province. The bank and various money merchants then transfer them from southern Shanxi to the province, and counties near Taiyuan also transfer them out of the province due to transaction needs. Therefore, the bank's annual transportation cost of cash is often no less than 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Since the Longhai Railway directly connects to Xi'an and the port of Lianyungang has been built, the commercial trend in southern Shanxi is likely to break away from Tianjin and move towards Shaanxi, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan. In the future, business operations must focus on Shaanxi, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Therefore, staff were sent to Shaanxi, Henan, Shanghai, and Wuhan for investigation, and it is planned to select appropriate personnel to set up offices in various places to promote development. With such a change, the need for hard currency will be reduced, the transportation expenses will also be reduced, the exchange will be smooth, the business will improve day by day, and the atmosphere of the market will also change.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>The bank is a public enterprise, and its articles of association state that its purpose is to regulate the financial situation of the province and support economic construction. Its nature is different from that of ordinary banks, so its business policy must be based on social benefits. All economic construction and public and private industries, if they have value for support, will be assisted to the best of their ability. As for enriching the internal and consolidating the foundation, it is the focus of attention on weekdays. Only with a solid foundation and a rich internal can we deal with the run on the bank in June last year with a calm attitude and try our best to pay in cash. As a result, it was quelled in three days. Since then, the bank's credit has been evident in society, and the efficiency of issuance has been smoother. Not only are the general merchants and people happy to use it, but the post office and railways also accept it and use it in the same way. According to the amount issued at the time of the run, it was more than 4 million yuan. As of the end of the year before the year, it reached more than 5.8 million yuan, which is enough to show that the bank's value has risen, and the public's belief in it has become more widespread. In the future, the internal will be further enriched, and the foundation will be more consolidated in the future. According to the total net profit last year was 426,203 yuan, 6 jiao and 9 fen. After deducting and allocating according to the regulations, and removing more than 30,000 yuan, the net profit was 358,085 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen, which is an increase of 119,901 yuan, 9 jiao and 1 fen compared with the previous year. In today's rural bankruptcy and economic depression, it is truly commendable to have such a result.</p>
<p>Actual Expenses</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the bank, the monthly expenses were set at 19,564 yuan. According to the needs of the expenses at that time, it was the lowest limit. Last year, in response to the needs of the social environment, the scope of business has expanded. There are now nine branches, nine offices, nine consignment shops, and 29 agents. As the business is busy, the expenses must be high. However, the annual settlement not only did not exceed the budget, but also saved 21,149 yuan, 5 jiao and 4 fen, which is due to the diligence of the bank's colleagues, the thrift in spending, and the effectiveness of promoting local products and implementing the new life.

<h3>Reorganization of Navigation Administration in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Report from the Construction Department's Navigation Administration Office</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: A one-year report from the Navigation Administration Office of the Construction Department of the Provincial Government, which has been managing inland waterway shipping, is as follows:</p>
<p>"Inland waterway shipping began on a trial basis in February of last year and was officially taken over on March 1st, making today exactly one year. The complexity of the work, the seriousness of its significance, and the enormity of its responsibility have made me, with my shallow knowledge and having studied electrical engineering, and not understanding the specialized knowledge of maritime transport, feel truly ashamed of my incompetence. If a suitable candidate had been found earlier, the results would surely have been ten times greater than they are today. Fortunately, I have been instructed by the Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman, the Director, and the Secretary, and I have also received the support of my colleagues in the department and all the staff in the office, who have worked together with a spirit of struggle to overcome great difficulties. In the past year, we have not encountered any unexpected major changes, and shipping merchants have also been able to enjoy huge profits, and the public has also been able to benefit from reduced prices. We dare not take credit for this, but only express our sincere gratitude.</p>
<p>The current state of shipping is very simple and can be reported with numbers. There are a total of sixty-seven ships under management and fifteen ships leased. According to the machinery, there are sixty-three steamships and nineteen diesel ships. According to the hull, there are nine steel ships and seventy-three wooden hulls. According to size, there is one ship over ten fathoms long, sixteen ships over nine fathoms, and twenty-seven ships over eight fathoms. The total displacement tonnage is approximately 5,900 tons. According to age, there are zero ships built within one year, three ships within two years, sixteen ships within three years, and sixty-three ships older than three years. From these figures, it can be clearly seen that its foundation is not sound. The total displacement is only 6,000 tons, which is less than twice the 3,693 tons of displacement of the China Merchants Bureau's Jianghua, and even less comparable to the 20,000 tons of the Canadian Empress that travels between the United States and China. Compared to the British Queen Mary, which was recently launched and has a displacement of 73,000 tons, it is twelve times smaller. The total estimated value of all inland waterway ships is only 750,000 yuan, which is less than half the cost of one of the China Merchants Bureau's newly built Sihai ships. The cost of the Haiyuan is 1.4 million yuan. It is pitiful that we have to use these dilapidated things to maintain the 1,500-kilometer navigation lines of the entire province's inland waters, and at the beginning of the takeover, it caused a huge uproar. It can be seen that the level of backwardness of our country's production is unbelievable. There are currently twenty-one shipping routes. The Hankou-Caidian route runs four times a day, the Hankou-Yangluo route runs twice a day, and the Hankou-Tuanfeng, Wuxue, Echeng, Huangshigang, Gedian, Cangzibu, Pengjiachang, Xindi, Jinkou, Huanglingji, X溝, Shayang routes, as well as the Shashi-Yichang, Shashi-Ouchi, Shashi-Hao穴, and X溝-Changjiangbu routes, each run once a day. The Hankou-Zhuhe and Maojiakou routes run every other day, and the Hankou-Ouchi route runs three times a week. Strict adherence to schedules and uniform fares have been widely publicized. An average of approximately 6,800 people travel by ship each day.</p>
<p>Shipping revenue and expenditure are settled monthly. The total revenue from mid-February to the end of June was 211,612.60 yuan, and the total expenditure was 187,239.71 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 24,372.89 yuan. The distribution method for the surplus is as follows: half is distributed to shipowners as a bonus at an annual interest rate of eight percent, plus an official interest rate of eight percent, for a total of one point six percent. The total revenue for the second half of the year, from July to the end of December, was 600,476.05 yuan, and the expenditure was 430,119.62 yuan, leaving a balance of 180,356.43 yuan. All official interest and repair depreciation expenses have been paid. However, one-third of the ships have not been overhauled due to time constraints. Therefore, it was decided to first withdraw 40,000 yuan from the above balance for repair costs to overhaul the ships, and then withdraw 5,000 yuan for public welfare funds. The remaining amount will be distributed to shipping merchants as a bonus, calculated based on the estimated value of the ship's capital, reaching an annual interest rate of two point three percent, plus an official interest rate of eight percent, for a total of three point one percent, which can be said to be the highest in Wuhan's industries. Compared to the official interest rate of eight percent and the bonus of eight percent, for a total of one point six percent, at the end of June last year, it has doubled. The above official interest is paid monthly, and the second-half bonus will also be paid in two installments before the end of the lunar year, with the remaining amount to be paid off by the end of this month. In addition, depreciation, calculated at seven percent for steel ships and one percent for wooden ships, is also paid monthly based on the number of days each ship operates. Therefore, shipowners benefit by about four percent. The remaining half of the surplus, 10,186.45 yuan for the first half of the year and 67,678.22 yuan for the second half of the year, totaling 77,864.67 yuan, will be used to reorganize the shipping routes, according to the plan. The purchase of dredging machines to dredge waterways and the construction of water gates are all in the design phase. At yesterday's provincial government meeting, it was discussed that the total of official interest and bonuses was three point one percent, which exceeded the two point five percent interest rate limit stipulated in the Public Utilities Supervision Regulations. However, in order to be considerate of shipping merchants and maintain the government's credibility, it was decided to pay the full amount according to the plan. But are the shipowners satisfied with one point six percent in the first half of the year and three point one percent in the second half of the year? No, the Chinese will never be satisfied. If they are not satisfied with the business, they will strive to expand it, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, most people are not satisfied with monetary benefits. This further proves that the profits that shipping merchants claimed to have lost a year ago were probably no less than one hundred percent. How can the shipping industry be compared to other industries in the country?</p>
<p>We have been trying out inland navigation for a year, and due to various reasons such as manpower and equipment, nine out of ten things have not been done well. The most painful thing is the lack of cooperation from shipping merchants. We are moving forward with a spirit of struggle and fearlessness, ignoring all kinds of alienation and sabotage, and taking great risks. For example, at the beginning of March last year, all the ships fled to Jiujiang. Except for maintaining the routes with six small ships, we were ordered to go to Qizhou to escort back the fleeing ships. The Hanxing ship we were on collided with the Mingguang ship of the Shihuiyao and Asia Oil Company at night, causing huge holes in the hulls of both ships, only two inches above the waterline. Fortunately, both sides were empty, otherwise water would have entered the cabins and there would have been sacrifices. We were thinking about the business, but they did not know it. Therefore, all kinds of difficulties can be broken. Other difficulties can be briefly reported in several items.</p>
<p>Seafarers are the basic talent of the shipping industry. The rise and fall, survival and death of the shipping industry are really shared with the seafarers. However, there are some non-deck and bottom seafarers who, under the name of seafarers, wantonly make requests. The cabin boy system in the middle cabin of large ships is still preserved, but we have broken it. From the beginning, no one on the inland waterway ships has asked for a penny of tips. This is one thing.</p>
<p>Heavy taxes and miscellaneous fees are everywhere. Although the central government has clearly ordered their cancellation, there is still a school tax. In the past, there were no less than fifty or sixty kinds of taxes and fees for inland waterway ships, such as lump-sum tax, ticket tax, head tax, security tax, education tax, business association tax, and landing tax. We have completely abolished them. Except for the boat ticket, no extra money can be collected from passengers. This is the second thing.</p>
<p>Three customs offices have been established within Hubei Province. Therefore, goods from Shashi and Yichang to Hankou must pay a transit tax. Within a country, it is strange to call the movement from one place to another an export. It is unheard of in the world. Now, within a province, moving from one place to another to a third place is also called export and requires taxation, which is even more incomprehensible. As a result, local goods are piled up in the interior and cannot be sold, which is a major violation of the purpose of revitalizing rural areas. However, we cannot violate the central government's regulations. Moreover, the customs system involves internal and external debt credit. Therefore, under the premise of protecting local products and not changing the customs methods, ships on the upper reaches of the river do not directly go to Shashi and Yichang, but only to Ouchi. Transfer personnel are stationed in Ouchi, and offices are set up in Shashi. Goods from Han, Sha, and Yi are all transferred by boat in Ouchi, without delaying the date or increasing the transfer costs for passengers and merchants. In this way, the payment of transit tax is avoided, and the benefits are still obtained by the passengers and merchants. Although the customs detained the ship and negotiated several times, there is no problem now. This is the third thing.</p>
<p>Military police inspections along the way delay time and cause disputes. The inland navigation regulations of this office stipulate that inspections should be carried out on the wharf and on the shore. Except for the specified wharves, ships are absolutely not allowed to stop for loading or unloading or to load passengers and goods in the middle of the voyage, so as to avoid smuggling. This method has been discussed several times with the Tobacco Prohibition Supervision Office, the Salt Affairs Audit Office, and other local military police, and an understanding has been reached. We are cooperating in handling the matter. Therefore, ship inspections are no longer seen. I remember that the Hunan Provincial Rice Tax Bureau in Chenglingji ordered the ships of this office to stop for inspection and collect a tax of one yuan per dan of rice. This office believes that inland navigation does not operate in Hunan Province and has no obligation to accept inspection and pay taxes. The bureau's sentries fired several times with live ammunition, which was very dangerous. Later, after the provincial government sent a telegram to Hunan, the matter was brought under control. This is the fourth thing.</p>
<p>According to the regulations set by the Ministry, military police traveling on ships should purchase half-price tickets. This office has provided special convenience during the period of bandit suppression in this province. Those who have complete uniforms and symbols and carry passports and road passes are allowed to purchase free tickets. In addition, all others must purchase tickets and there is no half-price ticket policy. However, there are often non-active-duty military police, as well as recruits and yamen runners and police, who do not understand the rules and cause trouble. Fortunately, the senior officers of each team maintained traffic and strictly cracked down on and stopped them at any time. It is really overwhelming and troublesome. This is the fifth thing.</p>
<p>Small boats in the province were originally managed by the Construction Department. This sovereignty was recovered from the Customs in the fifteenth year of the Republic. In the twentieth year of the Republic, the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was established, and small boat inspection and measurement fees were re-collected. The Water Affairs Department stopped collecting inspection fees in 1922. Now, during the period of management, this office has no reason to collect them again. According to the principle of separation of powers between the central and local governments, provincial affairs belong to the local government. This point has already been understood by all parties, and the sixth difficulty has been overcome.</p>
<p>Travel dangers are common. Deception of passengers has now disappeared on ships. Only one robbery by bandits occurred last year on the Shenan ship on the Tianmen route. Thanks to the local military police and security teams, one bandit and one suspect were captured and are now being tried by military law. This deters the courage of thieves. This office has also concentrated the road navigation troops, strengthened training, purchased new-style guns, and deployed them in sections. We safely passed through last winter and solved the seventh difficulty.</p>
<p>The navigation routes in this province have rapid currents in summer and are shallow in winter. The Cangzibu and Tianmen routes are suspended in November. Although the Changjiangbu is separated by the X溝 shoal, a ship is left in X溝 this year to connect the routes, which can be said to be uninterrupted. The Shayang route was suspended in October in previous years. This year, pilots were hired to explore the waterway in sections and set up water markers, costing more than one thousand yuan, which allowed the route to be maintained every day throughout the year. The other routes were never interrupted, and they did not stop operating during the Lunar New Year. Although it is easy to do, no one has done it before. This is the eighth thing.</p>
<p>The dispatch of military transport ships accounts for one-fourth. Large ships are selected, and at the same time, all routes must be maintained. In addition, it is necessary to cope with the crowded passengers and goods at the end of the lunar year. I had to use tugboats to replace them and barely got through it. This is the ninth difficulty.</p>
<p>Most of the ships under management are rotten and broken. We set up a machine shop to repair them ourselves. The machine shop has no start-up funds and uses old machines. With only three thousand yuan of working capital, we barely managed to get through it. This is the tenth difficulty.</p>
<p>Other trivial difficulties are encountered every day and every moment, and there is no need to go into details. In short, we have solved them with all our heart, all our strength, and all our spirit.</p>
<p>What is our goal in spending our energy to do this? Is it to earn some bonuses for the government? No, we have been trying it out for a year to test a policy, which is the management method of public utilities. Commercial operations have failed, and government operations are also unstable. Government supervision and commercial operations have even more perfunctory abuses. We supervised the Jingcheng Electric Light Company in the past and did not get good results. Now we are proposing "commercial supervision and public operation." The Supervisory Committee of Inland Navigation is actually commercial supervision, with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association, and accountants to check the accounts. Unfortunately, the shipping merchants have not used cooperation and goodwill to supervise. On the public operation side, the government has done its best, fulfilled its promise, and distributed bonuses. If it were not for public operation, given the current economic downturn, I don't know how much the shipping industry would have declined, and the above-mentioned ten difficulties could not have been solved at all. Now that we have been trying it out for a year, our method has proven to be sound. "Commercial supervision and public operation" can be applied to all public utilities. This policy adopts the Anglo-American advocacy of protecting capital and applies the Russian-German method of control and management, combining the strengths of others to suit China's national conditions. However, its organization must be more strict and definite and not be affected by politics. Only then can the foundation of the business be as solid as a rock. Detailed designs cannot be reported here. We must wait for the provincial government to decide whether inland navigation will be like this in the future. We do not know yet. We have repeatedly reduced the prices of tickets and goods for inland navigation, also to test a policy. According to economics, rising prices lead to industrial development, and rising living standards improve the people's level. However, in China, the ratio of prices to living expenses is too different compared to foreign countries. American coal miners can earn an average of three yuan a day and buy a loaf of bread for only five cents. Therefore, they can buy sixty loaves of bread a day. Chinese workers only earn three cents a day, and if a loaf of bread also costs five cents, they can only buy six loaves of bread a day. If calculated in American gold dollars, a loaf of bread costs five gold dollars, which is equivalent to one point five Chinese yuan. Then Chinese workers can only buy two loaves of bread a day. American coal costs three yuan per ton, while Chinese coal costs ten yuan per ton. An American car costs five hundred yuan, but it costs three thousand yuan in China. An American movie costs five cents, while a Chinese movie costs five cents, or at least two cents. And the salary of Chinese people, it is very good to earn thirty yuan. A very small position in England can also earn one hundred yuan a month. Not counting the exchange rate between the US dollar and the national currency, if the ratio of living expenses to salary for Americans is assumed to be one, then it is ten times for Chinese people. This is really living with the consumption of the 20th century with the income of the 18th century. How can it not be difficult to be exhausted? It is unreasonable to increase the income of Chinese people to improve living standards. Our country has no money at all, and prices continue to rise due to layers of interaction, making it difficult to reach the European and American standards. We turn around and want to reduce prices to suit the amount of income. Based on the ratio of living income, Chinese coal should be sold for one yuan per ton. In fact, Shanxi coal is very cheap, at most two yuan per ton. However, due to high shipping costs and other reasons, it sells for ten yuan in Hankou. We can do our best to reduce prices in terms of shipping costs. Domestic shipping costs are really too expensive. For example, the shipping cost of a ton of tung oil from Yichang to Hankou is twelve yuan, while the shipping cost from Hankou to Shanghai is only six yuan. The distance is doubled, but the shipping cost is halved. The shipping cost from Shanghai to the United States is only three US dollars. The distance is increased tenfold, but the cost is reduced tenfold. This situation can be studied. We want to help lower prices without lowering the benefits of living, support the circulation of rural local products, and resist the dumping of tens of thousands of yuan of foreign goods. This policy of suppressing prices is not the Anglo-American policy of currency inflation, but seeks self-sufficiency in products, adopts the Indian policy of non-cooperation and self-sufficiency, and the Japanese policy of revitalizing industry and commerce and low-price manufacturing, and the policy of cheap goods and peace under heaven in our country's dynasties. It is determined that this can revive the Chinese economy. Now shipping costs are a very small part, and most of it is still in the production and sales agencies. Although we cannot prove the effectiveness of this policy with numbers today, the activities of various industries and businesses in the province over the past year have indeed made us know that this road is correct. The relationship between suppressing prices and all aspects is too complicated. Military affairs, politics, transportation, finance, currency system, tax rules, industry, and commerce are all locked together. I am not an economist, and I don't know what theories to cite, but I can cite a very obvious fact as a conclusion. The price of coal in Xi'an used to be thirty yuan per ton, but now that the Longhai Railway is open to traffic, it has been reduced to eight yuan per ton. As a result, two new yarn factories have been established. Yarn factories can never use coal at thirty yuan per ton. This is the key to our economic revival."</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for Commerce in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Taishan County Markets Do Not Allow Credit Sales</p>
<p>Both Imports and Exports Decreased Last Year</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the beginning of spring, commerce in Guangdong Province has remained as sluggish as ever. The Economic Planning Association, affiliated with the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, has sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to decide on relief policies in order to solve the recovery of commerce in the city in the future, so that planning can be carried out. The fundamental reason for the decline of the market is the weak purchasing power of the people. The reason for the weak purchasing power is that foreign trade has plummeted in recent years. At the same time, the amount of money remitted to the mainland by overseas Chinese has decreased. Taking Taishan County in Guangdong Province as an example, the county has the largest number of overseas Chinese and is known as a wealthy county. After the United States banned the export of gold, the county's working capital completely stopped. In Taishan last year, I don't know how many stores closed down. This spring, transactions in the area have changed to a cash system, and credit sales are not allowed. In the past month, credit sales have been banned. The desolation of the market can be seen. It is heard that the regulations prohibiting credit sales in the market were issued and implemented yesterday by the Yong'an Market and Chonglou Market Chambers of Commerce in the county. The regulations stipulate: (1) All stores in this market should use cash transactions as the standard for retail sales, and should not extend credit out of sentiment to maintain capital; (2) All retail sales and wholesale sales should be based on cash transactions in principle, but for transactions between stores in the market, such as taking goods in and out with ledgers, they should be settled once a month to facilitate circulation; (3) For any store that does not comply with the regulations, once found, it will be severely punished; (4) These regulations will be implemented from the eighth day of the first month of the lunar year of the Republic of China. According to the usual practice in the Guangdong market, reliance is placed on credit and borrowing. Often, with 10,000 yuan in cash, merchants operate businesses worth 100,000 yuan. Now that the new regulations have been issued, funds cannot be used actively. It may be possible to maintain the status quo, but it is not necessarily possible to develop.</p>
<p>As for the province's foreign trade, both imports and exports decreased last year, and the trade deficit reached more than 78 million yuan. According to the statistics bureau's investigation, from the 19th to the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the total value of the comparison between the import of foreign goods and the export of local goods in Guangdong Province is as follows: (1) In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the import of foreign goods was 25,075,377 yuan, and the export of local goods was 16,465,3676 yuan. The trade deficit that year was 86,096,701 yuan; (2) In the 20th year, the import of foreign goods was 25,526,284 yuan, and the export of local goods was 15,203,4721 yuan, with a trade deficit of 10,322,7563 yuan; (3) In the 21st year, the import of foreign goods was 31,425,8054 yuan, and the export of local goods was 93,538,205 yuan, with a trade deficit of 22,172,0849 yuan; (4) In the 22nd year, the import of foreign goods was 26,922,000 yuan, and the export of local goods was 94,400,354 yuan, with a trade deficit of 17,476,1646 yuan; (5) In the 23rd year, the import of foreign goods was 15,655,3123 yuan, and the export of local goods was 78,252,674 yuan, with a trade deficit of 78,300,449 yuan. All of the above five years show a trade deficit, and the total amount of the trade deficit for the five years reached 664,100,7208 yuan. Judging from the above figures, the import of foreign goods was the highest in the 21st year, and the export of local goods was also the lowest. Last year (the 23rd year) the trade deficit was the smallest, and on the surface it seems optimistic, but in reality, it is a reflection of the sharp decline in the purchasing power of the people of Guangdong and the exhaustion of the social economy.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Surveys the Nanping Section</h3>
<p>Earthwork of the Yunan Section Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Yushan Communication: The Nanchang-Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is now under planning. The bureau has organized a Nanping Road survey team and appointed Lan Tian as the surveying director and Li Zhaode as the investigation director. They set off to conduct a field survey along the road. The provincial government has ordered the governments and garrisons of Nanchang, Xinjian, Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Xinyu, Fenyi, Yichun, Shanggao, Wan'an, Wanzai, and Pingxiang counties to provide effective protection and cooperate with the team in surveying and investigating. The Liangjiadu Bridge on the section was originally agreed upon by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and the Provincial Highway Bureau to build a joint railway and highway bridge in Liangjiadu. The required funds have recently been decided by the Provincial Affairs Conference to be allocated from the Highway Bureau's construction fee. Materials have been ordered from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and construction is underway day and night. As for the section from Yu to Nanchang, after the General Bureau set a deadline for completion and opening to traffic on the Double Tenth Festival, the various projects on the section are progressing actively. The earthwork of the entire section has been completed, and it is expected that this section of the project can be completed in October of this year. (February 27)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Grand Opening of the New Songjiang Society</p>
<p>Shen Lianbi and others, aware that Songjiang's municipal construction is progressing day by day, but there is still no proper organization to promote local welfare, jointly with outstanding members of the county, initiated the New Songjiang Society in the spring of the 21st year. For a time, they followed suit and expanded more than 30 mu of land next to the Songwei Motor Road to build a meeting place, forming more than ten buildings of houses and flat houses, with a large square in the middle, which is quite like a garden. Members are divided into four types: permanent, ordinary, sponsor, and student, and now there are more than 400 people, with the aim of connecting friendship, exchanging knowledge, promoting physical education, and improving society. After two years of planning, the opening ceremony was held today (3rd) at 9:00 am. Silver shields and couplets donated by all sectors were dazzling. Such as the congratulations from Chairman Lin, Dean Wang, Liu Yazi, Tang Shengzhi, Yao Yuanchu, Zhao Zukang, etc., and those who came to participate in person were members of the Central Committee Cai Yuan and were appreciated by all sectors.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dredging of Six Major Rivers Begins</p>
<p>The provincial office for dredging the Zhenzheng section of the canal has designated to recruit 1,800 laborers from Wumu to Shitangwan in Luoshe, Wuxi, to dredge six major rivers. Yesterday, the County Construction Bureau specially sent the head of the technical section Huang Dechun, technicians Xu Chuzhen and Xu Chuanlie to the 10th, 2nd and 4th districts to convene river dredging meetings and guide the construction of dams and allocation of work. The Nanma Ligang and Changguangxi rivers in the 10th and 3rd districts have been dammed and construction has begun. The remaining Li尖 River in the 2nd district, the Lv River in the 4th district, the Beixingtang River, which will be dredged in the 6th and 7th districts, and the Xizhang section of the Xiantang River in the 5th district, are all actively underway and can be started within days. Wang Shixi, an engineer from the Construction Department, was ordered to inspect the river dredging projects in the 17 counties of Jiangnan and came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to guide everything.</p>
<p>A Husband Kills His Wife in an Argument</p>
<p>Zhou Deming, 22 years old, from Yancheng, a resident of the Caopeng Lane in Lixiang near the Caishen Lane outside the west gate of Wuxi, works as a cart puller. His wife, Tao, 21 years old, works as a female worker in the silkworm cocoon copying room of the Jinji Silk Factory in the west gate. They have a daughter who is still young. The couple usually had arguments from time to time. Yesterday (2nd) at about 3:00 am, they suddenly had another argument over a trivial matter. Zhou Deming became angry and took a piece of western pine wood pillow and hit Tao's head hard, causing a hole in her forehead, blood flowed straight, and she fell on the bed. Before long, she died. Chen Huiyou, the head of the fourth Bao Nianerjia in that area, reported to the fourth branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the murderer Zhou Deming was arrested and taken to the bureau for custody. Chen Zizhao, the head of the 227th Tu, reported to the local branch court and requested an autopsy. At 2:00 pm, the coroner, accompanied by Wang Jian, went to perform the autopsy and confirmed that she had died from injuries sustained before death. After the autopsy, the coroner ordered the corpse to be prepared for burial. The murderer, Zhou Deming, will be transferred to the General Bureau today and then to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Donation for Reconstruction of Canghai Temple</p>
<p>Canghai Temple, one of the four famous Zen temples on the summit of Mount Yu, held a grand gathering on the Shangsi Festival last year. That night, a fire broke out unexpectedly. The ancient temple, deep in the mountains, had no way to call for help, resulting in the destruction of this wonderful ancient temple, turning it to ashes. Since then, the foot of Mount Yu has lost a scenic spot, which is a great regret to the local people. It is now known that the abbot of the temple has been running around and appealing to the local gentry, planning to raise funds for reconstruction. This matter concerns the scenic spots of the county and has received assistance from various parties. Plans are underway to raise funds for reconstruction. However, due to the labor and time required on the summit of the mountain, the funds needed will certainly exceed ordinary construction. The estimated funds needed are fifty to sixty thousand dollars. Efforts are currently being made to solicit donations from all parties and overseas Chinese in order to restore the original beauty of Mount Yu.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Hengyu Ferry Robbery Case Solved</p>
<p>The Hengyu ferry of the Yangzi Company's Zhenqing line was robbed by bandits between the Dagang Bridge to the south and the large and small culverts in Baoying County. After receiving the report, the provincial government, considering the Grand Canal as an important waterway for navigation in northern Jiangsu, and that the bandits dared to rob ships, was extremely angry. It immediately telegraphed the Baoying County magistrate and the head of the 4th District of the Provincial Water Police to strictly investigate and arrest the bandits within a limited time. It is now heard that the case has been solved by the 2nd Squadron of the 19th Team of the 4th District of the Water Police in Gejia Village, Baoying, with the arrest of bandit Zhu Shouxi. A camel hair coat and a wolf skin rug were found in the bandit's home. Subsequently, Zhao Hengchun was intercepted in Huai'an County, along with the stolen goods. Recently, Magistrate Zhou of Baoying County led a team to round up fourteen people, including Dong Yuzhen, in Huai'an, and a portion of the stolen goods have been escorted to the Baoying County Government for interrogation according to law, and for the stolen goods to be claimed.</p>
<p>Seven Bandits Executed by the County Government</p>

<p>Jiangsu Coastal Pirates to be Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Coastal pirates were discovered in the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province at the end of last year, and their activities were quite rampant. The provincial government ordered the complete mobilization of the 3rd District of the Provincial Water Police to suppress them within two months. It also dispatched the Ce Dian, Jing Hai, and Jing Dong patrol ships to patrol the Xiaosha area for rear defense. After departing on the mission, they passed through Rugao Yang and advanced north on January 3 of this year. Based on reports that a number of pirate ships were in the Huanghejian and Taozikou areas, they sailed through Xinyang Port and advanced north for encirclement and suppression. They also telegraphed Funing County to send teams to prevent blockades. On January 10 and 11, they came into contact with the pirates in the waters near Taozikou and Chaohekou, capturing four pirate ships, six guns, capturing thirty-three pirates, killing four pirates, and seventy or eighty people throwing their guns into the sea. The remaining pirates escaped by boat into Taozikou. After investigation, Taozikou is under the jurisdiction of Funing County, with barren suburbs on three sides, mixed with reeds, and a coastline of silt and sand beaches. Due to the terrain, it was not possible to immediately pursue them deeply. The remaining pirates took advantage of the north wind and the tide to escape south by boat. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, ordered all coastal counties to block coastal ports to prevent the pirates from landing and escaping, or from seeking supplies. At the same time, it strictly ordered the water police to track and intercept them. On February 10, a fierce battle with the pirates took place in the waters of Dongsha, Dongtai, capturing two pirate ships, capturing more than ten pirates, killing dozens of pirates, seizing four guns, one earthen cannon, and rescuing three hostages. Three water police officers were injured. The remaining pirates broke through the encirclement. On February 13 and 14, another encirclement and suppression was carried out in the waters north of Doulong Port, destroying one pirate ship belonging to the pirate leader Yu Sanduanzi, seizing one Yantai cannon, eight guns, killing more than ten people including the pirate leader Yu Sanduanzi, and rescuing one hostage and two boatmen. A wallet, business cards, and private seals were found on Yu's body. Two water police patrol leaders and one water patrol officer were injured. One boatman was killed. The remaining twenty or so pirates have collapsed and are no longer a force. The anti-piracy troops are still searching and suppressing them, and it is expected that they will be completely eliminated soon.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Industries Resume Accepting Real Estate Mortgages</h3>
<p>Land Prices Showing Signs of Recovery, Financial Situation Gradually Stabilizing</p>
<p>Reducing Credit Lending, Maximizing Acceptance of Goods as Collateral</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the Local Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other groups convened to discuss rescuing the market, the silver and money industries have resumed accepting real estate mortgages, and the financial situation is gradually stabilizing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Real Estate Mortgages Resume Being Accepted</p>
<p>In the past, it was customary for the silver and money industries to accept real estate mortgages as the only sound business, because real estate is immobile and its value is stable. Banks at home and abroad were happy to accept it as collateral. Since last year, due to the emergency in the money market and the sharp drop in real estate prices, the silver and money industries unanimously rejected real estate mortgages. If they were accepted, restrictions were very strict, resulting in sluggish real estate. Since the Local Association and other groups convened to discuss rescue measures, the silver and money industries have resumed accepting real estate mortgages, depending on their own strength. Therefore, today's real estate is slightly more active than before, and its prices are also showing signs of recovery.</p>
<p>Maximum Acceptance of Goods as Collateral</p>
<p>After the final accounting of the Republic of China in 1934, the foreign exchange rate announced daily in the money industry market was always at eight or nine points, and every year, after the final accounting, when the money industry began to send folds and lend money, it was always at the white exchange rate. Therefore, although the Shanghai money market is looser than last year, it has not fully recovered. The silver and money industries are very cautious about credit lending and are maximizing the acceptance of goods as collateral in order to achieve the goal of recovery. Therefore, Shanghai's financial industry is gradually stabilizing and is expected to fully recover after a considerable period of time.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

They took the Minsheng warship east on the 2nd and arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd. Kong remained in Nanjing due to official duties and needed to talk with President Wang. Song immediately changed to the 5:00 p.m. express train to Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 p.m. last night. After getting off the train, he went directly to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Feipeng and others from the Military Transportation Inspection Group returned to Shanghai on the 1st after their inspection abroad. They have been very busy socializing with the transportation industry in Shanghai for several days. Yu was originally scheduled to inspect the various agencies under the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai starting today. However, because Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia-hua fell ill in Nanjing, he took the night express train from Shanghai to Nanjing last night to visit him and pay his respects to President Wang, and report everything. He will then come to Shanghai for inspection. Those who traveled with Yu last night included Mrs. Yu, Young Master Yu, Shen Shihua, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Transportation, Cheng Chengyi, Section Chief, and Guo Xinsong, Director of the Postal Administration, among others.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengxu Went to Shandong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Organizing Warehouses to Circulate Goods</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu, Director General of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, went to Shandong by express train yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. at the urging of Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. The purpose of this trip is to prepare warehouses and promote farmers' cooperation. Because Shandong's agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, peanuts, and fruits are abundant, the establishment of warehouses will allow farmers to provide some of their surplus goods as inventory. When the time is right, commodity price securities will be issued to match currency with needs. This method has been actively promoted in Shanxi. Therefore, after Qian meets with Chairman Han in Jinan, he will go to Qingdao to meet with Mayor Shen to jointly discuss the rescue of trade in the Qingdao market. If a rough prototype can be formed, he plans to go to Shanxi to inspect the situation of commodity price securities and currency system in that province. After returning to Shandong, he will lecture on economics at the university in the province for two days before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Two British Members of the Ancient Art Selection Team Accompanied Lei Zhen to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>

David and Raphael will not stay in Nanjing for long. After paying their respects to President Wang and Minister Wang, they will stay for a day or two to visit the famous sites of the capital, and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Shenxin No. 7 Factory Incident Is Expected to Be Resolved Within the Week</h3>
<p>HSBC Is Considering the Solutions Proposed by Our Side</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing Talks About the Past Dangerous Period of Shenxin</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the HSBC Bank in Shanghai auctioned off the No. 7 Factory of the Shenxin Textile Company without authorization, people from all walks of life were filled with righteous indignation, and the government also paid close attention. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are actively planning rescue measures. At present, as a result of negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Government to the HSBC Bank, HSBC has generally agreed to consider paying 250,000 yuan of the overdue interest in advance, and the remaining debt will be repaid in full in four months in order to redeem the No. 7 Factory. However, the specific plan will still be finalized after Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrives in Shanghai. Last night, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to the residence of Rong Zongjing, General Manager of the Shenxin Company, to interview Rong and ask about his latest thoughts on the No. 7 Factory incident. Rong immediately denied with a very indignant attitude that the "If the government can redeem the No. 7 Factory, the factory is willing to be state-owned, and the banking consortium must also be assumed by the government" in a certain evening newspaper yesterday, saying that it was completely inaccurate. He continued, "This time, I am deeply grateful for the assistance of the government and society. At present, HSBC's attitude has gradually softened, and it has agreed to consider redeeming it in installments, which may come to an end in the middle of this week. As for the entire Shenxin Textile Company problem, since last year, due to the export of silver and the extremely tight money market, banks and money houses were unable to take care of themselves, causing Shenxin to fall into extreme difficulty. At present, the financial situation has loosened, and we are contacting banks and money houses separately for mortgage loans. If it can be successful in a short time, we will proceed to redeem it. Since the reform of Shenxin last year, the situation has become more stable day by day. The No. 7 Factory is still working as usual, and has not stopped working on Sundays. Recently, due to the large amount of inventory, the market is small, and the market is quite popular. The dangerous period has now passed."</p>
<h3>Aviation Patriotic Teams Are Recruiting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the Shanghai City Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association launched its second recruitment campaign, the team leaders have been enthusiastically carrying out the recruitment and fundraising work. He Dehui, the leader of Team 216, is a board assistant of the Shanghai Municipal Council and has been working hard these days. It is heard that members of the Chinese General Association and the club have all joined and are advised to become members of various types according to their individual economic conditions and to solicit aviation patriotic donations from outside.

It can be seen that the team leaders are enthusiastically supporting and working hard on the aviation patriotic movement.</p>
<p>The General Team Leader's Office, in accordance with the regulations of the China Aviation Association, solicited group members and sent letters to various groups in the city to join. It has been very enthusiastic these days, which proves the patriotic performance of the various groups.

<h3>The Special Party Department of the Security Office Has Been Conducting Cleaning Campaigns for Days</h3>
<p>All Units Conducted Major Cleanings, and the Inspection Results Were Good</p>
<p>The Special Party Department of the Municipal Security Office, in order to promote the New Life Movement, held a city-wide cleaning campaign on the 1st. The previous two days and yesterday, the cleaning continued to be carried out in each regiment and unit. All soldiers in the Fenglin Bridge Office, the Special Service Regiment Headquarters on Xueshi Road, the First Regiment Headquarters on Gonghe Road, the Second Regiment Headquarters on Jinji Road, and the various battalion headquarters under them, such as Baoshan Road, Tiantong'an Road, and Zhongshan Road, and the squadron headquarters such as Guangzhao Road, Taiyangmiao Road, Danjia Bridge, Tanziwan, and Guangfu Road, worked together to clean the bedrooms, dining rooms, offices, and other parts. The officers Yang Hu, Zeng Zesheng, Chen Zhuomin, Wen Huazhou, Mi Xi, Zou Yuzhen, Wang Weiming, Tong Baohui, and Chen Zhongsheng went to various units to inspect and guide, and the results were very good.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Bans Recruitment for Overseas Labor</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice yesterday to ban the recruitment of labor for overseas jobs, stating that it has recently been reported by citizens that some people have privately established a recruitment agency in the Guandi Temple in the West Gate of the city, inducing poor workers to go abroad to work in mines with high interest, resulting in the enlistment of a general uneducated worker. They said they would first take a ship to Xiamen, transfer to go abroad. The trip would take 18 days and nights. After landing, they would transfer to the train to the iron mine. This kind of act, which is close to selling piglets, has been seen many times in the past, and the outflow of Chinese workers who blindly go abroad is very harmful. Please investigate. According to the dispatched staff investigation report, the monks of the temple admitted that this was the case, and more than 30 workers from Shandong had been recruited to follow them. However, the truth of the contents is unknown, and the person in charge of recruitment has left the temple and gone elsewhere. The private recruitment of labor for overseas jobs has countless evils, and the temple did not report to the competent authority for approval when it allowed criminals to privately set up recruitment agencies during the winter defense period. In light of the previous situation, it is difficult to guarantee that the criminals have not secretly moved their residences or plotting something, and this matter must be investigated and prohibited. In addition to notifying the citizens, everyone should be aware of it, and do not fall into the tricks of criminals, and also send a letter to the Public Security Bureau for a thorough investigation, and instruct all subordinates to investigate and prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Overseas Inspection Commissioners of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Chunpu and Others Scheduled to Depart</h3>

<p>Consoling Overseas Chinese to Make Economic and Commercial Relations Closer</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Chen Chunpu, Liang Yugao, Zheng Qing, and others, who were sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inspect consulates in Nanyang and investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs, will depart at different times. Chen and Zheng arrived in Shanghai by special express train from Beijing at 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, and arrived at 11:00 p.m. that night. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Chen, who talked about the details of the mission. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled to Depart</p>
<p>Chen is scheduled to take the Great British Company's Chettalar on the 5th with his wife, and first go to Hong Kong, while Zheng will wait until the 9th to take the French Post Islandes 2nd ship with his secretary Su Hongbin and continue on. Then, he will meet Chen and take the original ship from Hong Kong on the 12th. Chen and Zheng are under orders to rush to Nanyang, while Liang will go to India, Myanmar, and South Africa. At the same time, Liang will be going to Myanmar with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has another mission, which will be later than Chen and Zheng, and the departure date must be determined again.</p>

<p>Manufacturers' Welcome Banquet</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, General Manager of the China National Products Production and Sales United Company, summoned the manufacturers concerned at 7:00 p.m. last night and held a public banquet at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road to send off Chen, Zheng, and Liang. During the meeting, the plans and methods for promoting national products in Nanyang were discussed in detail, and He Bingji, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Office of the Bureau, were invited to accompany the guests.</p>
<p>Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Chen at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road. Chen said that the mission of himself and others was to inspect the affairs of the consulates and to investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs. It was found that Sino-South trade, now that the local products operated by overseas Chinese, such as rubber and tin, have improved slightly compared with before. However, other commercial activities have not developed at all. Efforts should be made to promote national products and cultivate overseas Chinese merchants. On the 26th of last month, I had previously visited Shanghai and met with Qian Chengxu, Director General of the China National Federation of Industries, Wu Zhihao, General Manager of the China National Products Production and Sales United Company, Wang Xingyao, Director of the China National Products Introduction Office, and other business leaders to discuss in detail the promotion of national products to various parts of Nanyang. This inspection will provide guidance to the consulates on overseas Chinese affairs. In the future, after returning to China, a report will be prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the government will make all decisions accordingly. Zheng and I were also ordered by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to comfort the overseas Chinese in those areas, and so on.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Company Actively Assembling Large Ford Aircraft</h3>
<p>Expected to Be Assembled in Mid-Month</p>
<p>China Aviation Company, in order to open the Shanghai-Yunnan route, purchased a large Ford aircraft from the United States at a price of 150,000 yuan, because the route is full of mountains and ridges. The aircraft arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 1st of this month, and was immediately unloaded at the Longhua Airport. American engineers are supervising the craftsmen to assemble it. It is expected to be assembled in mid-month. At that time, a short-distance test flight will be conducted in Shanghai. If the results are good, the Shanghai-Yunnan route will be tested on a scheduled basis. According to the company, the specialty of the large Ford aircraft is that it is structurally strong and durable. The fuselage is made of metal and has three large motors, which can generate 1,450 horsepower. The speed is 135 miles per hour. There are ten passenger seats, two pilot seats, and wireless telephones for both heaven and earth lines. Therefore, the aircraft is not only structurally strong, but also the internal equipment is quite perfect.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables the Legislative Yuan Again, Requesting Prompt Enactment of the Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>Adopting a Proportional Share System</p>
<p>To Revive Declining Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, stating: "To the Honorable Legislative Yuan, Nanjing: The Commercial Registration Law, stipulating the issue of joint and several liability, is in line with the effectiveness of regulating the current Article 681 of the Civil Code. This was proposed by the Honorable Yuan's legislators and has received the sympathy and support of various local chambers of commerce. Regarding the reasons for advocating joint and several liability, our Chamber submitted documents to the Honorable Yuan on March 10, 1933, June 26 of the same year, and November 6 of the previous year, repeatedly and exhaustively detailing the arguments. We have recently heard that the preliminary review of this registration law has been completed. However, regarding the issue of partnership liability, there are those who advocate the adoption of a joint liability system, which has caused hesitation and indecision, leaving the matter unresolved. Upon investigation, the only difference between joint liability and joint and several liability is that the creditor has no right of choice. In terms of the actual responsibility borne by the debtor, it is still the same as joint and several liability. Our Chamber, in its presentation on November 6 of the previous year, already provided a detailed analysis of the inconveniences of this system. In the past, various chambers of commerce have repeatedly voiced their disapproval of the former Supreme Court's precedents on this matter, stating that they are not in line with national conditions. There are documents that can be examined. Some argue that the current proposed system is designed with the interests of creditors in mind, as if the merchants represented by the chamber of commerce are entirely in the position of debtors. This is far from the truth and needs no further explanation. Currently, the commercial market is in a dangerous situation, with businesses closing down one after another. Those who can barely sustain themselves are also afraid of future burdens and are generally thinking of shrinking their operations. Those with meager assets are also afraid of the heavy responsibility and dare not engage in commerce. If this continues, it is feared that there will only be successive contractions and no new developments. Whether a legislative policy is appropriate or not can always influence the social economy. At this critical juncture of the survival or demise of commerce, our Chamber has a deep understanding and dares to disregard the risk of offense and reiterate our previous request. We humbly request that your esteemed department adopt the original draft of Article 9 of the drafting members of the Commercial Registration Law, submit the law to the Yuan for discussion as soon as possible, and pass it for implementation to revive declining commerce and comfort the anxious commercial sentiment. This would be a public convenience. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows. Winter."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau to Move to New Location Within the Month</h3>
<p>Renovation Work at the New Site Progressing Actively</p>
<p>Personnel to be Deployed After Completion Within Days</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, due to the dilapidated state of its original location in the old Daotai Yamen in the Nanshi district, which was unsuitable for office use, purchased a property from the Shanghai County Government on Penglai Road, formerly the Shanghai County Government office, consisting of approximately 60-70 buildings. Sheng Yunji Construction Company was contracted to renovate the property and build new facilities, including a car park, a repair shop, a detective team office, and a detention center. The original deadline for completion and handover was the end of last year. However, due to issues with the construction permit and the relocation of residents, the deadline could not be met as scheduled. As the bureau urgently needed to move in, it repeatedly set deadlines. It has now been over five months. The contracting company has been working overtime in recent days to accelerate the construction, and most of the work, including the interior decoration and painting, has been completed. The new facilities are expected to be completed within days.</p>
<p>Buildings Divided into Three Sections</p>
<p>The new location of the bureau is divided as follows: the front section will house the reception room, mail room, military band room, foreign guest reception room, and male and female detention rooms. The second section will house the director's office, various department offices, and archives. The rear section will house the detective team and detention center. The east side building will house the accounting office, general affairs office, and the lost and kidnapped women and children reception room. The west side building will house the medical officer's office, the overseas passport office, and the foreign registration office. Three buildings behind the east side building will serve as the case reception room and preliminary hearing court. Behind the four side buildings are several newly built car parks and repair shops.</p>
<p>Move-in Within the Month</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Sheng Yunji Construction Company yesterday, due to the expiration of the deadline, they have been working overtime to accelerate the construction, which has been quite hectic. They originally planned to hand over the property yesterday, but some minor details are still incomplete, such as the rewiring of several lights and the construction of pedestrian walkways. Therefore, it will be delayed for a few more days. Everything can be completed at once. However, according to the planned schedule, the property must be handed over within days. Once the various interior works are completed and cleaned, the Public Security Bureau plans to come and arrange everything, and it is expected to officially move in and begin operations around the middle of this month.</p>
<h3>Inscription on the Monument to the Loyal Martyrs of Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Expected to be Completed Around the End of the Month</p>
<p>During the January 28 Incident, countless soldiers and civilians died. After the ceasefire, people in Jiangwan collected over 1,300 bodies and built a cemetery for the loyal martyrs on the site. This project began long ago and is expected to be completed around the end of this month. A memorial archway is being built in front of the cemetery entrance, and the inscription for the monument has been written. The Municipal Government has approved the Public Works Bureau's request to build a monument to the loyal martyrs from the Moon Stone Bridge in Jiangwan to the cemetery. The original text of the inscription is recorded below: "Inscription on the Monument to the Loyal Martyrs of Jiangwan January 28." "On the night of January 28, 1932, the Japanese army invaded our Zhabei and attacked Wusong. Unable to succeed with all their might, they concentrated their forces on Jiangwan. On February 20, they ordered a general offensive. Our Jiangwan territory, with its prosperous towns and densely populated villages, was reduced to scorched earth in less than ten days. Alas, how cruel! In mid-March, the war had just ended. Cai Weizhang and Lu Chengyu, directors of the Chongshan Hall, and others, could not bear to see the anti-Japanese soldiers and fallen compatriots lying dead in the fields. Therefore, they organized a burial team, raised funds, selected personnel, and developed a plan, working diligently day and night. Despite the restrictions imposed by the enemy army, they did not slacken in their efforts to prevent exposure. In the winter of that year, they opened up over nine acres of public land in Changgouwan, north of the town, and gathered the bodies buried in the suburbs and buried them in a single mound in the new Western style to comfort the loyal souls. Two years later, they again raised funds to build a memorial archway, a tomb house, open up thoroughfares, and plant flowers and trees, completing the entire project. The sacrifices of the people in the January 28 Incident were enormous, and the survival of the nation depended on it. Without a little magnificence to inspire the public's aspirations and to seek revenge, the responsibility falls on those who come after. How can we merely see this as the benevolent burying of bones? In this incident, 1,300 bodies were buried, not including those buried in Guangzhao Mountain Villa. Over 15,000 yuan was spent. Yan Enpu, a fellow villager, independently donated 500 silver dollars for the memorial monument. Wang Weiguan from Ningbo donated over 10,000 silver dollars for burial expenses. Their enthusiasm for public welfare and their leadership in advocating for this are commendable. The other individuals who contributed their efforts and donations will be remembered separately.

<h3>Dai Chaofu Dies Unexpectedly</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a No. 14 streetcar of the China Merchants, traveling south from north, was passing the Yongsheng Wharf in the Nanshi district when a porter, Dai Chaofu (25 years old, from Jiangbei, living in a thatched shed west of Sanguantang in Pudong) and another porter carried a long, large piece of timber out of the Yifeng Lumber Company, intending to cross the road. Dai Chaofu walked a bit slower, causing the streetcar to arrive, and he was unable to avoid it. He was knocked to the ground, and the timber he was carrying fell on his head. Instantly, his skull was shattered, his brain matter burst out, and he lost consciousness. Zhao Gengyang, the watchman of the 16th Gang in that area, heard the news and rushed to the scene. He immediately transported the injured Dai Chaofu to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The streetcar driver, Fu Baoyin, was taken to the Dongjiadu Police Station under the jurisdiction of Yi, the station chief, for questioning. Because the case involved a human life, he was ordered to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.

Qin slapped him in the face and had his friend, Cao Laowu, beat him. Flower, outnumbered, took the opportunity to escape and stayed with a friend in Ziteng Gang, Minhang. At around 9:00 PM on the 14th of last month, Flower came to Shanghai for business. He was spotted by Qin near Haizhou Road, Ningwu Road. Qin asked him to go to the Sanyuan Fang teahouse on Yangshupu Road to talk, but he refused, and another brawl broke out. Yang Guifu, a local, and Cao Fushou, from Anhui, tried to mediate, but neither side would give in, saying that they had to kill one of them. Yang, fearing that a major incident would cause trouble for them, said, "If you act like this, I will report you to the police," and ran away. Flower and Qin saw this and fled north. As a result, they continued to fight fiercely half a mile away, falling into a river. Qin was seriously injured and died on the beach. Flower escaped and returned to Minhang. After the case was reported, Zhang Yunjian, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu Police Station, discovered his hiding place and arrested him, sending him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan of the Third Criminal Court interrogated the defendant. He confessed that he did not intentionally want to kill him at the time. It was the deceased who provoked him, causing this unfortunate incident. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu appointed lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody, setting a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Huaying Pharmacy Creditors' Meeting Resolved to Resume Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>Twelve Representatives Elected on the Spot</p>
<p>Verify Accounts and Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Huaying Pharmacy on Nanjing Road, due to financial difficulties, was resolved by the shareholders to suspend business in all branches from the 1st of this month and to entrust accountant Xie Lin to announce the liquidation. Mr. Xie notified all creditors to convene a meeting at the Daya Lou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Over 200 people attended, representing a total of 900,000 yuan in creditor rights. First, Mr. Xie reported the purpose of the meeting and a brief overview of the accounts. Then, 12 creditors verified the accounts and discussed solutions. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Report on Accounts</p>
<p>Mr. Xie reported the accounts, including 100,000 yuan in share capital under liabilities, 50,000 yuan in mortgage loans, over 31,000 yuan in deposit guarantees, over 161,000 yuan in unpaid goods, over 179,000 yuan owed to various banks and money shops, over 783,000 yuan in deposits. Assets included over 623,000 yuan in inventory, over 212,000 yuan in real estate, over 40,000 yuan in property, over 40,000 yuan in deposit guarantees, over 175,000 yuan in customer debts, over 83,000 yuan in temporary debts, over 49,000 yuan owed by branches, over 45,000 yuan in losses, totaling over 1.338 million yuan.</p>
<p>Shareholders' Resolution</p>
<p>Mr. Xie continued, "From the above asset and liability situation, it can be seen that there is too much inventory, and it is difficult to recover external debts, resulting in financial difficulties. The sluggish market is also an important reason. The company's shareholders held a meeting to discuss that, fearing the market downturn and that deposits would only go out and not come in, regardless of legal facts, there was only dissolution and liquidation to avoid increasing losses. Otherwise, lawsuits would pile up, fearing that the balance would be lost. Therefore, at the shareholders' meeting on February 28, it was resolved to dissolve and liquidate, and accountant Xie was selected as the liquidator to legally conclude the matter."</p>
<p>Deliberations on the Aftermath</p>
<p>"However, the pharmacy business is not the same as ordinary stores. It may not be easy to get a good price when selling goods. If the creditors have a proper solution, the shareholders and directors will all comply. Therefore, this accountant was entrusted to convey this intention, so we are holding a meeting today to discuss. In my opinion, the company's assets and liabilities are of such a large amount, the original share capital is only 100,000 yuan, and the losses are almost half. It is also a limited company, so the aftermath is very important to the creditors. The creditors should make their own decisions to save the situation."</p>
<p>Resolution to Resume Business</p>
<p>After discussions among the creditors on the spot, everyone said that the pharmacy has a long history. The suspension of business this time is due to the accumulation of inventory, and it is possible to resume business. It was resolved that the resumption of business should be carried out and that 12 representatives should be elected, one representative for every 100,000 yuan of creditor rights. Ding Mengxian, Shao Jingfu, Pu Lianming, Zhang Yiling, Ren Zhujun, Zhang Jingbang, Tian Yunda, Chen Tinghe, and others were elected on the spot. The above are deposit representatives. The goods representatives are Shenchang Foreign Firm and Yimoke Foreign Firm. As for the two representatives of the silver industry, they are outside the meeting and will be elected on their own. After the meeting, the representatives exchanged views and decided to first consult the account books at accountant Xie's office and then decide on a solution.</p>

<h3>American Company Requests Improvement of Hunan-Hubei Kung Fu Tea</h3>
<p>Letter from Jinlong Foreign Firm to Hankou Municipal Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>The Jinlong Foreign Firm in this port previously sent a letter to the Hankou Municipal Commodity Inspection Bureau requesting improvements to Hunan-Hubei Kung Fu Tea. The translated text of the original letter is as follows: Dear Sirs, We recently received Mr. Winstan's report on the American survey of American opinions on Chinese tea. Much of it would be of interest to your bureau. Therefore, we are forwarding a summary.</p>
<p>Tea Chests</p>
<p>The materials used for Chinese tea chests are too weak. They are transported to America over long distances and cannot last. Damage often occurs. Such opinions have been repeatedly heard. After research by tea merchants in that country, it is generally believed that packing in Ceylon boxes made of three-ply plywood would eliminate these concerns. However, even if Ceylon boxes are used, America may not be willing to pay a higher price to purchase the tea. However, it would certainly be much easier to promote sales.</p>
<p>Competition</p>
<p>The competition from Japanese and Taiwanese tea is becoming increasingly fierce. Their greatest advantage is the sturdiness of their tea chests, which is far superior to that of Chinese Kung Fu Tea. Now, due to their clean and well-made tea, they have been granted special permission by the American government to be handled according to the Java standard tea method, that is, they can be used to blend Orange Pekoe and Pekoe. (Translator's note: Orange Pekoe and Pekoe are both types of black tea popular in Europe and America. If they can be blended, sales can be greatly increased.) However, Chinese tea is handled according to the Chinese Kung Fu Tea standard and cannot be blended into Orange Pekoe and Pekoe teas for sale. If it is to be blended, it must be specifically noted on the label. Although the standards for Japanese and Taiwanese black tea will be revised in the near future, the ban on using Chinese tea for blending may not be lifted. Several large American tea merchants have stated that Hunan-Hubei Kung Fu Tea is often cheaper than Japanese or Taiwanese black tea in terms of price. However, due to the restrictions of the aforementioned ban, they cannot use Kung Fu Tea to blend their brands. This is a pity. The following are opinions expressed by American tea merchants to Mr. Winstan: (A) One person said that they personally liked Kung Fu Tea, but for business reasons, they had to handle Japanese black tea, as the leaves of Japanese tea are cleaner and better suited to the market's taste. (B) One person said that they handled very little Kung Fu Tea, as Japanese and Taiwanese teas are very competitive in the market, and Japanese tea is particularly competitive. (C) One person said that they personally liked Kung Fu Tea, but as a blending tea merchant, they could not purchase Kung Fu Tea because of the aforementioned restrictions. (D) (A very large tea merchant, who is also a member of the American Tea Association) said that the business of standard Kung Fu Tea is small because it cannot compete with Japan and Taiwan. The above four opinions can represent the opinions of tea merchants across America. Our firm summarizes them further as follows: (1) The leaves of standard Kung Fu Tea must be selected more carefully in order to compete with Japanese tea. (2) There is very little hope of promoting precious black tea in America. What America needs is the cheapest tea. However, although the price of the tea is cheap, the quality cannot be too poor. It must meet the standard Kung Fu appearance set by the government. Therefore, attention must be paid to the cleanliness of the leaves, and the price must be similar to that of Japanese tea. (3) Tea chests must be improved. The worst Chinese tea chests are those from Xiangtan. For the sake of sturdiness, it seems possible to add four corner strips inside the box. (4) All tea chests must be lined with parchment paper between the lead lining (tin lining) and the tea leaves to prevent the tea from coming into contact with the lead. (This is a regulation of the American government and must be followed.) The above matters are related to your country's tea industry. It is said that your bureau is working hard to improve Chinese tea production. Therefore, we offer our views for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Request to Dispatch Experts to Study Fire Well at Taizhou Guild Hall</h3>
<p>Findings of Technician Zou's Investigation</p>
<p>Opinions Expressed by Various Parties</p>
<p>The fire well discovered in the Dingfeng Soap Factory within the Taizhou Guild Hall on Xinqiao Road, Lujiiawan, in southern Shanghai, has been previously investigated by personnel from the Municipal Social Bureau, as reported in previous newspapers. A Central News Agency reporter, believing that this matter is of great importance to industry, inquired with the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The bureau dispatched technician Zou Enyong to investigate and sent a letter to the Industrial Experiment Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Chinese Chemical Industry Association, requesting them to send experts to the bureau to conduct further research together. The findings of technician Zou's investigation are detailed below:</p>
<p>Fire Well Situation</p>
<p>The fire well is located in the Dingfeng Soap Factory within the Taizhou Guild Hall on Xinqiao Road in the southern Shanghai district. The well site used to be a water well, but it suddenly dried up. Although it was filled in, it repeatedly subsided, so it was filled with coal ash. Then it suddenly heated up, and flames poured out of the well pipe continuously. However, within a two-foot radius around the wellhead, there were also sporadic emissions of gas. Currently, the soap factory has built a brick wall around the well, with a large pot placed on top, filled with water, which is heated using the fire. The fire is extinguished at night and relit the next morning. This fire well has been discovered for more than a year. The gas in the well has been emitting constantly, seemingly without any increase or decrease.</p>
<p>Gas Testing</p>
<p>The gas was entrusted by the bureau to the Industrial Experiment Institute for detailed testing. The results are detailed in the table below. For reference, the qualities of natural gas invented by Luo Guorui and Shanghai Gas Company's coal gas are also listed in the table.</p>
<p>Gas Volume Measurement</p>
<p>The gas volume of the fire well was entrusted to the Shanghai Gas Company for measurement. The results are as follows: (1) The gas pressure fluctuates considerably, approximately equal to the height of a 5/8-inch water column. (2) Estimating with a 2-inch diameter well pipe, the gas volume is approximately 1,000 cubic feet per hour. (3) There is a lot of gas leakage. Based on this calculation, 24,000 cubic feet of gas can be produced per day. If leakage is prevented, the gas volume should be more than this.</p>
<p>Various Opinions</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the well, various parties have conducted investigations and expressed opinions, which are recorded below: (1) Shen Xiongqing, director of the Industrial Experiment Institute, believes that the production is not very large and will eventually extinguish itself. (2) Meng Enjun of the Shanghai Gas Company believes: A. Whether the source of this gas is sufficient is a problem. It is entirely possible that it will be extinguished. It is quite dangerous to invest in methods to utilize it. B. If the Dingfeng Soap Factory can add some equipment, the fire power can be increased. For example, according to the principle of a Bunsen burner, a hole can be drilled at a certain point below the pipe opening, so that air is mixed with the gas first, and then it is burned. Compared with the gas already ejected from the pipe opening, such as mixing with air, it will definitely get full oxidation, and the firepower will be greater. Currently, the outside of the iron pot at that place has a thick accumulation of black smoke, for this reason. C. There are more than one gas leakage around the well. If a surrounding wall and roof can be built to collect the gas volume in one place, the gas volume should increase. However, if the gas flows into this surrounding wall from the outside, it is feared that this surrounding wall will cut off the gas source. D. If a pump is used to extract the gas, it is quite feared that air or other miscellaneous gases will also be sucked in.</p>
<h3>Yao Lifang, Manager of Yao Shuntai Fish Shop, Accused</h3>
<p>Plaintiffs are Yao's Two Nephews</p>
<p>Accused of Uncle Embezzling Shop Funds</p>
<p>Yao Lifang, manager of the Yao Shuntai Fish Shop on Meibai Road, is accused of embezzlement and private enrichment, misappropriating more than 100,000 yuan from the shop's funds. He was recently sued in the First Special District Court by the shop owners, the Yao brothers, Yao Lindi and Yao Maodi, who hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to seek justice for his alleged crimes. Earlier, when the father of Lindi and others, Yuyuan, was alive, he initially started a fish business, working diligently and managing carefully. After several years of hard work, he had some savings. In the late Qing Dynasty during the Guangxu era, he invested in opening the Yao Shuntai Fish Shop at the northern end of the Xinzhapu Bridge. Because Lifang was a brother, he was given the position of weighing clerk. Lifang served diligently. In the third year of the Republic, Yuyuan suddenly suffered from a head wind disease and could not manage the shop's affairs. Because Lifang was a sibling and he seemed honest, he was appointed as manager, taking charge of all matters in the shop. In the fifth year of the Republic, Yuyuan was seriously ill and knew that he would not recover. Because his wife was a woman, his eldest son Lindi was only six years old, and his youngest son Maodi was still in swaddling clothes, he entrusted his orphans to Lifang on his sickbed, and instructed Lifang to carefully manage the shop's affairs, so that the business he created with his life's energy would not be ruined. However, after his brother's death, Lifang took advantage of the fact that his sister-in-law and nephews living in the shop were widows and orphans and could not do anything. He acted unilaterally and arbitrarily took private money from the shop to fill his greedy pockets, while only giving his sister-in-law and nephews 100 yuan each year for pocket money. He never announced the annual accounts to his sister-in-law. Yuyuan's wife was very dissatisfied, but because her two sons were still young and afraid of Lifang's power, she had to endure it for the time being. In recent years, Lindi and Maodi have grown up one after another. Although Lindi works in the shop, he only earns a salary of more than 10 yuan a month. He is not allowed to consult on the contents of the shop. Until last winter, Lifang felt that his two nephews were by his side and felt that he could not do what he wanted, so he took the initiative to take over, firing Lindi on the pretext and issuing an eviction order, ordering his mother and three children to move out of the shop. Lindi and others could no longer bear it and filed a criminal lawsuit against his uncle, saying that since their father's death, the defendant had intentionally embezzled the shop's funds. The total business volume of the shop each year is about 400,000 yuan. The commission taken by the shop is calculated at 7%, so that in addition to all expenses, the annual profit can be 10,000 yuan. For 20 years, all the annual profits have been swallowed by the defendant. Therefore, the defendant can live in luxury, successively taking three concubines, and purchasing 25 city houses and one residence on Gonghe New Road. He also built three city houses and a fishing pier in Beixinjing. The defendant was originally destitute. Although he was employed in the shop and received a salary, there was no private accumulation. The fact that he has such a huge amount of money must be entirely due to embezzlement. The facts are obvious. They requested that the defendant be punished according to Article 356 of the Criminal Code, and ordered to hand over the account books handled over the years for a thorough investigation of the actual amount of embezzlement, and another lawsuit will be filed. The trial was held by Judge Zhan Liangce in the afternoon of the previous day. First, the plaintiff stated the previous situation, and then the defendant Yao Lifang defended himself against the charges, vaguely saying that the fish shop opened by the plaintiff's father was declared bankrupt when he died. Today's fish shop was established by him. He retained the plaintiff's mother and three children in the shop out of brotherhood in order to fulfill his responsibility of education. The court then instructed the court to postpone the hearing and summon witnesses for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Jiang Kanghu Lectures on Temperance and Taciturnity</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Dr. Jiang Kanghu gave the third lecture on the Ten Precepts of Good Life at the Grand Auditorium of the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Dr. Jiang specially invited the Bingxun Stenography Society of Shanchangli, Kade Road, to record the lecture. There were more listeners than the first and second times. The upstairs and downstairs were almost full. The lecture was on the fifth and sixth precepts: temperance and taciturnity. The main points of the lecture are recorded below. Dr. Jiang lectured on temperance, saying that there are two kinds of desires: one is food, which is used to maintain life, and the other is sex, which is the sexual desire between men and women, which is used to continue life. Mencius said that food and sex are nature, and even Sakyamuni could not avoid these two things, but they must be restrained. There is no absolute thing in the world. For example, although arsenic is harmful, it can be used to replenish the body if used properly. Although ginseng is beneficial, it can sometimes kill people, so desires cannot be indulged. Dr. Jiang then lectured on taciturnity. He said that there are beneficial words and useless words. Chinese people use cursing their parents as a cliché. This kind of useless words should be less spoken, less until no speaking. Even beneficial words must be based on the person, the matter, the time, and the place before speaking. Otherwise, it is best to remain silent.</p>
<h3>Great China Rubber Factory Held First Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Re-electing the Second Board of Supervisors</p>
<p>The Great China Rubber Factory Co., Ltd. in this city held its first shareholders meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club to report on last year's business situation and re-elect the second board of supervisors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shareholders Present</p>
<p>There are more than 400 shareholders in the Great China Rubber Factory. Yesterday's attendees included Lin Kanghou, Yu Ziqing, Xue Fuji, Wu Zhesheng, Shi Weishan, Yu Xingben, Yang Weiyin, Huang Boqin, Xue Yangqing, and more than 300 others.</p>
<p>Xue's Report</p>
<p>After performing the necessary formalities, Chairman Yu Ziqing first delivered the opening speech, followed by manager Xue Fuji, who reported on the factory's business situation last year. He vaguely stated that since the factory was reorganized into a joint-stock company, it suffered from the impact of prolonged drought and social depression, resulting in no significant progress in business. According to the factory's largest lifeline, the production of overshoes accounted for the majority. Later, due to the intense competition from the same industry and the flooding of the market by a certain domestic product, which was sold at a low price, the large quantities of overshoes produced by the factory each month often suffered from excessive inventory and a gradual decline in sales. In order to find another way to earn a living, the factory colleagues spared no expense to send people abroad to purchase machines, carefully research, and manufacture automobile tires in order to recover profit rights. However, we are currently hoping that the government will provide strong protection so that the automobile tire products can be sold throughout the country, bringing glory to the country and honor to the nation. The former supervisors Shi Weishan, Lin Kanghou, and Yu Maotang then reported on the factory's assets and liabilities, respectively.</p>
<p>Re-election of Supervisors</p>
<p>After the report, the voting began. As a result, the elected supervisors were still the former members Lin Kanghou, Shi Weishan, and Yu Maotang. They took the oath of office on the spot. Finally, a dinner was held, and the meeting was adjourned until 9:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<h3>Educator Yu Huaiqing Passed Away</h3>

Recently, due to overwork, he fell ill and retired. Unfortunately, since lying in bed, he has been confined and passed away at noon on the 2nd of this month. Even at the end of his life, he was still talking about school affairs. He can be said to have died in the line of duty. The coffin will be sealed on the 4th (Monday) at已刻 (a time of day), but the funeral is not yet. There will definitely be a grand scene of plain cars and white horses at that time.</p>

<p>Hong Zhen, the chief of the Xujiahui Police Station in western Shanghai, recently learned that there was a gambling and skimming operation on the upper floor of No. 2086 Hague Road. He ordered patrol officer Hu Qiuqiao and police chief Pan Xuezeng to lead the entire team of police officers to the address at 1:30 AM yesterday. They arrested a large number of male and female gamblers, including Zhang Haiming, Wu Zhaorong, Wang Jingwen, Wang Dai's, and Wu Gu's, totaling 43 people. They were brought back to the station along with the confiscated gambling tools and gambling money. After a brief interrogation by Chief Hong, they were formally sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday for interrogation. It is said that the number of criminal cases discovered this week has decreased by six cases compared to last week, and the number of criminals discovered has decreased by 77 people compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Punishment for Seducing a Minor Girl</h3>
<p>Zhang Genbao, a local resident living in a flat at No. 132 Puji Shilu, French Concession, works as a foreman in a construction factory. He has a daughter named Cuizhen, who is 16 years old this year. In the autumn of last year, she was seduced by Gu Amao (26 years old this year), a carpenter from Suzhou who lives next door, and committed adultery. The girl slept on the upper floor of her mother's room. Gu dared to go to Zhang's house to sleep with her. On the evening of December 6 last year, Gu went to Zhang's house again to continue their affair. Zhang returned home and heard the sound and discovered it. Just as he was about to go up to the upper floor to arrest him, Gu had already rushed down and fled home. Zhang immediately reported to the police station, and Gu was arrested. After questioning, it was learned that the girl voluntarily committed adultery, so no public prosecution was filed. Gu was only ordered to move out in three days. After Gu was released from the police station, he still did not move. The girl's father, Zhang Genbao, was unwilling to accept this and hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Gu of seducing a girl under the age of 15 and disrupting public morals. According to the lawsuit, the court opened a hearing presided over by Judge Li Changnian. Gu admitted to having intercourse with Zhang's daughter three times, voluntarily by the girl, and not induced. The girl did not admit to voluntarily inviting Gu to her home to commit adultery. The plaintiff requested that Gu be severely punished. The court ordered that the debate be concluded and the defendant be held for a scheduled sentence, which has been reported in previous newspapers. The previous day, the date of sentencing arrived, and the plaintiff and his daughter came to the court to await instructions. Judge Li came to the fourth criminal court and ordered the defendant to be brought to court. The judgment was that Gu Amao continuously raped a girl under the age of 16, and sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment. He also explained the meaning of the judgment to Gu, saying that in law, raping a girl under the age of 16 should be sentenced to more than seven years of imprisonment. Now, after questioning, it was learned that the girl volunteered, and you did not force it, which is excusable, so the sentence is reduced by two grades to one year and nine months. Gu replied obediently and was taken away by the bailiffs and returned to the detention center to await the appeal period before being sent to prison for execution.</p>

<h3>Hooligans Violently Beat a Person to Death</h3>
<p>Principal Culprit Xiao Zifan Fled, the Murderer Zhang Xiaomao was Arrested</p>
<p>Recommendation Shop was Afraid of Causing Trouble and Moved the Body into the Alley to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Ni Lin's, a woman from Hefei, Anhui, is 45 years old this year. She is currently working as a maid at the home of Chen Li's, a Fujianese, at No. 14 Ming Deli, Xiafei Road, French Concession. Recently, she took a leave of absence and stayed in a house rented by fellow villagers at No. 137 Pushi Road. At 8:00 PM on the 1st of this month, Ni Lin's was pouring dirty water in front of the door, which splashed on a local rogue nicknamed Xiao Zifan who was passing by, which led to a verbal dispute. After being persuaded to disperse, Xiao Zifan was still not satisfied and immediately went to Zheng Yuanli, Beidiaolu, to gather Zhang Xiaomao (13 years old), a Jiangbei Haimen native who watched the alley in the area, and dragged Ni Lin's out to hold her down. The two men then committed the crime of beating her, causing Lin's to be unable to resist. She was punched and kicked and fell, injuring her head, and bleeding profusely. It was not until passers-by and neighbors persuaded them to stop. Later, Lin was injured and borrowed to lie down in Fang's recommendation shop at No. 53 Beidiaolu. Unexpectedly, due to excessive shock to the brain, she could not be treated in time and died at 7:00 AM the next morning. Fang Lin's, the owner of Fang's recommendation shop, was afraid of shifting the blame to herself and discussed with Luo Geng's, a fellow villager, and did not report to the police station. Instead, they took advantage of the early morning when there were few people and carried the corpse out and abandoned it in the neighboring Chunkuili alley at No. 55 to try to shirk their responsibility. Later, Xu Zhanghe (53 years old), a Shaoxing native who watched the alley in Chunkuili, discovered the corpse and reported it to the Lujiiawan French Police Station. After sending investigators to investigate, it was learned that the deceased had died from injuries from being beaten the night before. The murderer Zhang Xiaomao was arrested, Xiao Zifan had fled after hearing the news, and Fang Lin's (40 years old, Hefei native) and Luo Geng's (50 years old, also a Hefei native), the owners of the Fang's recommendation shop who moved the body, were brought to the case for investigation. At the same time, the body was sent to the coroner's office, waiting for the court to send someone to examine it today. The criminals Zhang Xiaomao and Fang Lin's, Luo Geng's, etc., were also sent to the court today for separate prosecution. The police station also sent a notice to all the detectives on duty to investigate and arrest the fleeing criminal Xiao Zifan and bring him to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhengru's Concubine Sues for Paternity in Dongbao Case; Continued Trial</h3>
<p>Dongbao Actually Denies Having This Biological Mother</p>
<p>Liu's Concubine Tearfully Pleads for Ye Shantao to Testify</p>
<p>Liu Zhengru (also known as Chengxu, Chengru), a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, passed away many years ago. During his lifetime, he extensively acquired concubines, resulting in a large number of children, totaling eighteen sons and daughters. His ninth son, Dongbao, was born to his fourth concubine, Yan Yuying. Dongbao is now over twenty years old. Yan was taken as a concubine by Liu in the first year of the Republic (1912). On the twenty-third day of the third month of the following year, she gave birth to Dongbao. However, the couple's abuse worsened daily, making it unbearable for Yan. Consequently, she was forced to leave the Liu family in the winter of that year. For over twenty years, she has wandered without support. Now that her son has come of age, he should</p>
<p>support his elderly mother.</p>
<p>She negotiated with Dongbao, but Dongbao actually denied being born to Yan. She had no choice but to hire lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to file a confirmation lawsuit with the First Special District Court. This was reported in previous newspapers. Recently, Judge Yu Changzi held a continued trial. The defendant did not appear. The lawyers presented the separation agreement signed by Yan and the court settlement record from a previous lawsuit, stating that neither of these documents</p>
<p>mentioned Dongbao</p>
<p>as the plaintiff's biological son. Moreover, at the time of the settlement, the plaintiff was given eight thousand yuan. Now she is suing again, which is a case of double jeopardy and contrary to legal procedure, requesting that it be dismissed. The plaintiff, Yan Yuying, stated that she married Liu Zhengru as a concubine in the first year of the Republic and gave birth to Dongbao in the third month of the following year. The first wife was unusually abusive, and it became even worse at this time. She would always find ways to take away the milk purchased for Dongbao. There were countless insidious methods, too many to list. In the sixth month of that year,</p>
<p>I became pregnant again.</p>
<p>However, by August, the abuse had become unbearable. I left Liu in Qingdao and went alone to Tianjin. Liu then persuaded Ye Shantao to go north and persuade me to return to Shanghai on the seventh day of the eleventh month. However, because I was not tolerated by the first wife, I was refused entry into the house. Liu also refused to provide another residence. I had no choice but to follow Ye Shantao's advice and sign a separation agreement. At that time, Ye also said that Liu was old and that after his death, Dongbao would naturally still recognize me as his biological mother. Therefore, the agreement did not state that Dongbao was my biological son. The Liu family also believed that because</p>
<p>I was about to be divorced,</p>
<p>and the child in my womb was not yet fully developed, they found an abortionist to force me to abort the fetus before I could leave. My marriage to Liu as a concubine was originally arranged by Ye Shantao, and the separation was also mediated by Ye. Although Liu has passed away, Ye is still alive and can be summoned to testify. While speaking, tears fell like pearls, and she was extremely saddened. Subsequently, the lawyers for both parties debated the procedural point and concluded the debate. The judge announced that the verdict would be announced at a later date.</p>

<h3>Hubei Native Place Association Election Meeting</h3>
<p>The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai held a membership election meeting yesterday at 1:00 PM at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau were dispatched to supervise the meeting. More than 700 members attended. Li Xingchen, Guan Jiongzhi, Liu Wanqing, Yin Guanzhi, and Wang Shaocheng were publicly elected as the presidium. After the formalities, Guan Jiongzhi reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly that last year's general meeting of the association was full of vigor, but there had been many disputes in the past. By the day of last year's general meeting, everything had been explained clearly, and harmony and unity had been achieved. We fellow villagers are one family and should work together in harmony. I know that everyone must recognize this point. In the future, I hope that everyone will unite and work together to promote the association's affairs. Last year, in handling disaster relief in our province, the donations and relief goods from our fellow villagers, together with the assistance requested from the drought relief associations in various provinces, totaled more than 160,000 yuan. Although this was only a drop in the bucket, it was not without some help. This proves the necessity of uniting Hubei natives in Shanghai. However, we do not necessarily need a large building for the native place association, but rather the spiritual construction of all fellow villagers, which is taller and more magnificent than any building. I hope everyone will keep this goal in mind and work towards it. Subsequently, Peng Yuncen reported on the past situation of the native place association. Wang Longzhang, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, hoping that the fellow villagers would unite and set a good example for the association. Yin Guanzhi delivered a reply on behalf of the association, expressing thanks. The election then began. Because there were too many ballots and the time was late, it was decided by public discussion to ask the representatives of the party and government to sign the seals on the ballot boxes and hand them over to the native place association for safekeeping. The ballots will be opened publicly at the association at 9:00 AM on the 6th of this month, and the results will be published in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Publication of the National Studies Masterpiece "Introduction to National Studies"</h3>
<p>Highly Respected by Contemporary Scholars</p>
<p>The term "National Studies" is interpreted slightly differently by people today, but generally, it refers to the achievements of our Chinese nation's cultural activities. If we want to improve the present and create the future, we must understand the past in all its aspects, and then innovate and modify it, building on the existing foundation to achieve greater excellence. This is a consensus among scholars, and writings such as "Introduction to National Studies" are also urgently needed at present. Now, Mr. Hu Huaichen, based on his usual research findings, has written "Introduction to National Studies," a book that provides a correct and concise account of the interpretation of National Studies, the purpose of studying National Studies, and the methods of studying National Studies. Many contemporary scholars have praised it. Chen Zaizun, a professor at Jiaotong University, said, "It can enable readers to gain novel common knowledge of National Studies in one day." Guo Butao, a professor at Fudan University, said, "This book has two characteristics: the emphasis on seeking knowledge and applying it to practical use makes the purpose correct. Although the classification still uses the old method, the argument in each chapter can actually integrate the past and the present, and distinguish and reconcile the right and wrong in a proper manner, so the understanding is sufficient." Zheng Shixu, a professor at Jiaotong University, said, "It is practical and applicable and can represent the author's reading vision and writing skills." Jiang Kanghu said that it can be "regarded as equally important as Zhang Zhidong's 'Qianxuan Yu'," and so on. This book has already been published and is distributed by Lehua Bookstore on Simalu in this city.</p>

<p>Insurance Yearbook to be Published Soon Our country's insurance industry has never had accurate statistics, which has caused it to remain at its inherent level and not increase. To seek the development of the business, it is necessary to first base it on historical facts. If there are no accurate statistics to show the truth of the facts, how can a path to progress be obtained? The editorial department of the China Insurance Yearbook, in view of this, compiled the 1935 Insurance Yearbook. The investigation and editing took six months to complete. It records the actual data obtained in a relatively systematic manner. The entire book is divided into four sections: the upper section is an overview of the insurance industry, which indicates the evolution, categories, and effects of the insurance industry; the middle section is an overview of the insurance industry in various countries around the world, which describes in detail the path of development of the insurance business in various countries; the lower section is an overview of the insurance industry in China, including a general overview of national insurance companies, which publishes the content of each insurance company, a survey of insurance business in various places, a report on the situation of the insurance industry in Guangdong, and various numerical statistics, which show the truth of the insurance business; the appendix is insurance laws and regulations and others, including government laws and regulations, translations of insurance policy contracts, and industry regulations and company charters. Anyone engaged in the insurance business must be prepared, and those who study the insurance business must read it. The entire book is printed on 23k Daolin paper, with a hardcover binding, in one large volume. The price is five yuan in national currency per copy, and the pre-order price is three yuan in national currency.

<h3>Special Feature: Discussion on Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese newspapers have been widely reporting on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. We believe that given the past animosity between China and Japan, to speak of cooperation so suddenly is far from reality. Although adjustment is a prelude to cooperation, we generally feel that given the current Sino-Japanese relationship, it is more appropriate to speak of adjustment rather than cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called Sino-Japanese economic adjustment, according to the results of the discussion held by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 14th of February on economic adjustment toward China:</p>
<p>(1) To foster greater harmony between economic organizations and industrialists of both China and Japan, encouragement will be given to dispatching economic survey missions to China. However, this matter must be implemented after consultation with those involved in civil affairs.</p>
<p>(2) To thoroughly reform China's economy and finance to achieve self-reliance, Japan intends to provide the following types of assistance to China:</p>
<p>(A) China, as an agricultural country, is importing rice, wheat, and other food products from overseas, which is most unnatural. Japan is willing to provide China with economic and technical assistance in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>(B) Cotton and other industrial raw materials that Japan must import from foreign countries will be encouraged for mass production in China, forming the foundation for Sino-Japanese economic adjustment, while also seeking to increase the purchasing power of Chinese farmers.</p>
<p>(C) To achieve rational management of Chinese industries, Japan is willing to provide China with economic and technical assistance when necessary.</p>
<p>(D) Implement a quota system for Sino-Japanese trade to increase the import of goods from both countries.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of Chinese silver outflow, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the Ministry of Finance and the Yokohama Specie Bank, hoping that an international agreement can be established to alleviate the United States' silver purchase policy and the 1933 International Silver Agreement. However, concrete countermeasures have not yet been studied. Foreign banks, due to special relationships, mainly export silver from Shanghai, which has a significant impact. Japan hopes that China will improve its currency system, reorganize and unify bank notes, to reverse the precarious situation.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese government is willing to establish a special bank in Shanghai with a capital of approximately 200 million Japanese yen to relieve the poverty of China's financial and industrial circles. This 200 million yen credit institution can not only facilitate the financial turnover of Sino-Japanese trade relations, but also bring great benefits to both countries. In particular, China's tariff revenue can be increased by this, and other policies can be improved smoothly.</p>
<p>(5) However, there is an absolutely necessary condition, which is to require China to strictly prohibit anti-Japanese activities, especially to thoroughly ban anti-Japanese education. It must be known that rejecting inexpensive and high-quality Japanese goods is the biggest obstacle to China's economic revival.</p>
<p>(6) China must reflect on tariffs, and not only refrain from raising them in the future but also specifically reduce them for Japan.</p>
<p>These are the official opinions of Japan. As for the economic circles, such as the Tokyo and Osaka Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other economic organizations, there have been discussions and expressions of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, which are roughly similar to the above-mentioned guidelines of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will not be quoted in detail here. However, what is worth our attention is why Japan is advocating Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at this time? We can explain this by considering (1) the widespread rejection of Japanese goods in the past year or two, and (2) the importance of the Chinese market to the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>The survival of the entire Japanese economy is entirely built on export trade. If various countries reject Japanese goods and the Chinese market cannot be arbitrarily used by Japan, then the Japanese economy will inevitably fall into collapse. However, the so-called economic nationalism is practiced by almost all countries in the world, and Japanese goods have no room to operate during the prevalence of this economic nationalism. The means by which various countries reject Japanese goods include raising tariffs, managing exchange rates, restricting imports, implementing import quota systems, and even severely prohibiting the import of Japanese goods and levying anti-dumping duties on Japanese goods, thereby preventing Japanese goods and protecting the development of their own industries. The situation of various countries rejecting Japanese goods is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>United Kingdom: Raise tariffs to prevent imports.</p>
<p>France: Imposes high tax rates and exchange rate taxes to make it unprofitable for Japanese merchants; implements import quota systems for several important commodities such as ferromagnetic materials, timber, and aquatic products, to ensure that Japanese goods cannot freely enter French territory.</p>
<p>Germany: Roughly the same as France.</p>
<p>Italy: Raises tariff rates and manages exchange rates to ensure that Japanese goods entering Italy cannot make substantial profits.</p>
<p>Belgium: Implements an import quota system.</p>
<p>Switzerland: Implements an import quota system and bans the import of several commodities such as rubber shoes and cotton fabrics without government permission.</p>
<p>Netherlands: Same as Switzerland.</p>
<p>Austria: Implements raising tariffs, managing exchange rates, and deciding that Japanese goods cannot be imported without permission.</p>
<p>Hungary: Same as Austria.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia: In addition to managing exchange rates, Japanese goods cannot be imported without permission.</p>
<p>Romania: Implements controlled imports for 130 types of goods and manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>Poland: Implements an import quota system.</p>
<p>Spain: Implements an import quota system and manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>Greece: Implements an import quota system, manages exchange rates, and exchanges Japanese goods for goods that are beneficial to itself.</p>
<p>Turkey: Implements an import quota system and manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>British India: In addition to raising tariffs, it also promulgated the Industrial Protection Act, abolished the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, and entered into a reciprocal treaty with the United Kingdom to resist Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Malay Archipelago: Raises tariffs and establishes a special relationship with the United Kingdom to restrict the import of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies: Raises tariffs on general commodities, prohibits the import of rice and soybeans, and implements import quota systems for cement and cotton cloth, and issues emergency import restriction orders.</p>
<p>Philippines: Raises tariffs and abolishes ad valorem taxes.</p>
<p>Siam: Raises tariffs.</p>
<p>United States: In addition to raising tariffs, it levies anti-dumping duties on Japanese goods and prohibits the import of Japanese sake and beer.</p>
<p>Canada: Raises tariffs and implements exchange rate surtaxes.</p>
<p>Brazil: Raises tariffs and manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>Argentina: Manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>Chile: Uniformly raises tariffs by 50% and manages exchange rates.</p>
<p>Egypt: Raises tariffs.</p>
<p>Union of South Africa: In addition to raising tariffs, it levies anti-dumping duties.</p>
<p>East Africa: Raises tariffs.</p>
<p>British Africa: Declares secession from the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty.</p>
<p>Australia: Manages exchange rates and levies exchange rate surtaxes.</p>
<p>Ecuador: Prohibits the import of Japanese raw silk and cotton cloth.</p>
<p>The widespread rejection of Japanese goods around the world is not because Japan forcibly occupied our Northeast provinces and withdrew from the League of Nations, thereby upholding justice, but because various countries cannot compete with Japanese goods that have low wages, low exchange rates, and lower costs. It is a natural result that various countries have to reject Japanese goods to protect their own industries. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wang Xiaolin)</p>
<p>Some people like to eat sparerib noodle soup, and others love beef fried rice, but I like to eat "cold shoulder." Although this dish is pitifully cold, it is also refreshingly cold. Compared to "eating cold rice at the table" and "drinking hot soup under the door," it is ultimately superior.</p>
<p>Miserly people, in love, will bring out money that they are reluctant to part with, either sadly or surprisingly generously. This fact is readily available around us. It seems that "love" is a wonderful remedy for "miserliness." Speaking from an economic standpoint, "love" should be the enemy of "money."</p>
<p>The new Eight-legged Essay has a few sentences that say: "Let the past be the past, and there is no need to yearn for the future. Reality is active before our eyes, seize this reality!" What exactly is reality? How to grasp this reality? "Drink today's wine today," "Monk of the day, strike the bell of the day." Is this what is meant by seizing reality?</p>
<h3>Shepherd's Purse Song of the Third Day of the Third Month</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>"On the third day of the third month, the weather is new, many beautiful women on the streets of Chang'an..." This Tang Dynasty poem, the record is actually like the current Gregorian calendar, wonderful! The third day of the third month was formerly the Shangsi Festival, which is exactly the time when spring is rippling. Investigating the normal state of physiological function, there will inevitably be women cherishing spring, so there are many beautiful women on the road! Who says that the works of our country's old poets are not scientific?</p>
<p>I remember a folk song, which also depicts the feelings and demeanor of girls in this season, while also portraying陋俗, both incisively and humorously; here is the entire song, accompanied by an explanation.</p>
<p>"Third day of the third month, shepherd's purse blossoms and forms peonies. Peony sister wants to marry. Pomegranate sister is the matchmaker. When the matchmaker arrives, the ghosts discuss. When the sedan chair arrives, the parents cry. Long towel, short towel, wipe away tears and then withdraw!"</p>
<p>Shepherd's purse is used as an object to indicate the season, and symbolizes a group of rural girls. The saying goes, "A young girl changes eighteen times"; shepherd's purse blooming can form peonies, metaphorically rural girls in their youth development stage, like flower buds just opening, will become beautiful. The time of the third day of the third month, with drums and flutes in every house, is exactly the weather for getting married; Peony sister is the same as others, pities her jade appearance, naturally wants to marry. Pomegranate sister, not yet in time physiologically, but also seduced by the annoying spring colors, then holds the idea of "walking in the spring breeze with summer rain," like adopting a daughter-in-law, and takes on the role of matchmaker. The matchmaker has ten unpardonable faults that are even worse; the bride also has many hypocritical solutions to imitate and force to be real. However, daughters are inevitable in human feelings, the sad feelings of leaving relatives have become the rhythm of crying when getting into the sedan chair, forced by vulgar rituals; this kind of tears shed for parents in name, is only a formality, rarely out of grief! The long and short towels wipe away tears and then withdraw, it can be seen that she is anxious and flustered, this is the true emotion revealed!</p>
<p>The composition of this song has a very ancient style, and it is particularly smooth and pleasant to sing, which is also worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Mass Grave</h3>
<p>— Hu Chenzhou</p>
<p>"Look, this is the mass grave!"</p>
<p>Following the direction pointed by the boatman, I saw a building that was not much different from a dirt fortress, covered with countless mosses and wild vines. These creeping plants could not hide its broken walls and ruins, which seemed like the remains or relics of war. In the center of the front was a large opening, which seemed so deep that it was impossible to measure its depth. It stood alone in the twilight wilderness, surrounded by rugged ground and lush weeds stretching to the distant horizon.</p>
<p>Looking, looking, still not understanding the old boatman's strange term, I couldn't help but think and asked him, "What do you mean by mass grave? What is a mass grave?"</p>
<p>"Mass grave?" He stopped rowing and began to smile slightly. Obviously, he was proud of his familiarity with the ancient allusion. "You, sir, are not from here, so naturally you wouldn't know. But, ah, let me tell you! That is a pit, a pit for dead people!"</p>
<p>"A pit for piling up dead people, you say?" I couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>"Yes, a pit for piling up dead people. There are corpses of children piled up inside, thousands upon thousands of them. You know, when poor families have children die, they don't have money to buy coffins, so they wrap the corpses of children in a rotten rush mat or a piece of rag, take them here, and throw them into that opening and it's done."</p>
<p>I was a little surprised. However, the boatman's indifferent expression in narrating this event immediately convinced me. The question knocked on my lips and returned to my throat again! I stared blankly at the terrifying repository of death, imagining the scene inside: there must be a special breath there, and countless microbes must be crawling. Some of the corpses there should have turned into skeletons long ago, some should have rotted, and some should be rotting, after rain, sun, and weathering!...</p>
<p>Suddenly I thought of those children lying under the white marble in the Shanghai Cemetery, one or two years old, or even only one or two months old. Their tombstones are exquisitely decorated with white marble goddesses of peace, white marble monuments engraved with the dates of birth and death of the deceased, and flowers in large glass domes, I was lost!</p>

<h3>A Study of World Famous Wines (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yu</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Humanity and Wine: Northern peoples prefer to drink strong wines, while tropical peoples prefer to drink sweet and mild wines. Mongols in the frigid cold prefer to drink milk wine containing a small amount of alcohol. This is in terms of national character and climate. Milk wine is a by-product of the pastoral era, and grain wine is a by-product of the agricultural era. Wine originated in the wild era of mankind. (This is not intended as a joke by the author. In Europe, there is also this myth that at that time, wandering in the mountains and fields, picking tree fruits and grass fruits to fill their hunger, there was a demihuman wine god who taught the method of winemaking.) This is in terms of the era of wine's birth. The Chinese use rice, wheat, and sorghum to make wine, the Russians use rye, barley, naked barley, and corn to make wine, the Indians use coconut, and the Mexicans use agave. This is in terms of the raw materials being subject to natural control. People in cold regions say that wine can overcome the cold, and people in tropical regions say that wine can conquer the heat. This is in terms of the nation's view of wine. The color of wine also varies with the national character of different regions. Generally, peoples with a shorter evolution tend to like deep and strong colors, while the opposite is true for pale and light colors. Therefore, by observing their preferences, one can know what kind of people they are.</p>
<h3>Entered the Gates of Hell</h3>
<p>— (Xiaoxiao)</p>
<p>Some people say:</p>
<p>Losing "love" is like plucking out the heart.</p>
<p>Losing "affection" is like hooking away the soul.</p>
<p>The youth's common saying: "Love can irrigate youth"</p>
<p>Then; losing love is not: "Entering the Gates of Hell!"</p>
<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3>Impressions of Dali</h3>
<p>— Jing'an</p>
<p>The name of Dali. Few people know it, but when the three words "Dali Stone" are mentioned, everyone knows it. This Dali is the place that produces Dali Stone, in the northwest of Yunnan, is the capital of the Nanzhao Kingdom in the Tang Dynasty and the Dali Kingdom in the Song Dynasty; the climate is mild, spring all year round, the territory is mountainous, the scenery is excellent! The four scenes of wind, flower, snow, and moon are very famous, that is, the flowers of Shangguan, the wind of Xiaguan, the snow of Cangshan, and the moon of Erhai.</p>
<p>Fifty miles west of Dali City, there is Cangshan Mountain, also known as Lingjiu Mountain, which is said to be the place where Guanshiyin Bodhisattva practiced Taoism. The mountain range originates from the southern branch of Kunlun Mountain, with nineteen peaks, the highest reaching 14,000 feet, overlapping peaks and ridges, stretching for more than a hundred miles, dignified and majestic, with trees standing tall, verdant and lovely. Ordinary mountains "open the forest mist at sunrise"; this mountain is not the case, only opens up briefly in the morning, when the sun rises in the east, the entire mountain is covered by clouds and mist. Only in July and August, there are no clouds all day long, only white clouds horizontally between the mountains like a white belt, called "Jade Belt Clouds", which is the so-called scenic spot of "Jade Belt Locking Cangshan". These situations are all personally witnessed. It's really a miracle! In addition, there are many flying springs, hanging cliffs thousands of feet, pouring down, the sound is like a Hong Zhong, shocking the ears.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that there are many ice creams sold in the mountains. At first, I thought there was an ice-making factory in this remote county; but asking the locals, they didn't know what kind of ice-making factory it was. Further investigating where their ice came from, I learned that it was taken from the top of Cangshan Mountain in winter and stored in a shady and humid rock, and taken out in the hot summer and mixed with cane sugar for drinks. According to Cangshan, snow accumulates after the chrysanthemums, and begins to melt in early summer. The time for its accumulated snow is so long, so the snow stored by the locals for sale is a lot, and the price is also cheap.</p>
<p>East of the city, there is a freshwater lake that is 20 to 30 miles wide and 90 miles long, shaped like an ear, which, according to the locals, is the ancient Yeyu Lake. Because it is shaped like an ear, it is also called Erhai, the benefit of fish and shrimp is quite large, and it is especially useful for the irrigation of farmland. There are three islands, four continents, and nine curves, all of which are very suitable for building gardens and huts. Thirty miles south of the city, where the Erhai water descends, there is a stone bridge called "Tianqiao", the secluded gorge is deeply hidden, the stone bridge spans left and right, like a family; relying on nothing in the air, only crossing one person, the situation is dangerous! When I passed this bridge, I was shocked and wanted to turn back repeatedly! After crossing the bridge, walking a hundred paces west, there is a rock, in front of the rushing stream, splashing waves like plum blossoms; this bridge is also called "Buxie Meiqiao", I am afraid it is from this that it came. When the bright moon rises in the east in the evening, the waves sparkle, and the fishing boats sway, it is even more interesting. This is the night scene I saw on the day I went to Erhai, I don't know if the so-called "Erhai Moon" is such a scene?</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Being Poor at Complimenting, Begging People to Suffer Reprimands, Failing to Return Home, Being Confused by Exaggeration</p>
<p>Jia Duocai smiled lightly at him: "Thank you, Brother Zhang, for your good intentions to be a persuader for us, this wild horse doesn't have to run too far." Zhang Jiefu smiled and said: "That's fine too, I think this sister-in-law is an overly honest person, there's no need to speak to him evasively, just tell him everything in a few words, and let him make the decision." So he got up two steps, walked to Mrs. Hu's side, leaned down and said to him: "This Mr. Jia has long intended to take your daughter as a concubine, you know that. How much money do you want before you agree?" Mrs. Hu and his mother-in-law, as well as his family member Mrs. Hu, who wasn't hoping to get a sum of money from Yueying to relieve everyone's difficulties. As for how much money they could ask for, they really had no standard. Mrs. Hu's intention was that two generations of widows could live a lifetime following this girl, which would be fine. If there were a few coins in hand to spend, naturally it would be good. Even if there was no money, with such a son-in-law who runs a silver shop, what would they have to worry about? Moreover, they were afraid that the other party would not agree if they asked for too much, and they were afraid of being cheated if they asked for too little. Zhang Jiefu raised such a question to him, suddenly, how could he answer it, he babbled for a while, and finally managed to squeeze out two sentences, he smiled and said: "Mr. Jia is a living god of wealth, how could he give less? I don't know how to speak, what do you want me to say?" Zhang Jiefu turned his head and said: "Brother Jia, what do you mean?" Jia Duocai gave him a wink, fixed his eyes outside the room, and Zhang Jiefu followed him out. After about ten minutes, only Zhang Jiefu came in alone, pulled Mrs. Hu's sleeve, let him stand up, and then let Yueying lean against the wall with him. He whispered: "Sister-in-law, do you see those silver dollars on the table? If your heart is moved, those silver dollars will be yours immediately." This was another unprecedented miracle in Mrs. Hu's ears, how could there be such a strange thing, his heart was flustered, what should he agree to? He suspected that this was a dream. (147)</p>
<h3>Records of Ephemeral Fragrance from the Imperial Court</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Speaking of myself, when I went, I was of course very happy, always thinking that this trip would be extremely rewarding, but little did I know that I only saw many strange lanterns and smelled the stench of lilacs, which was enough to make people sick for days and nights, how could it not make people disappointed and lose all their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Li Lianying hurriedly walked from his own carriage to the Empress Dowager's carriage.</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Empress Dowager! In just a few minutes, the train will arrive in Tianjin!" He kowtowed and whispered his report, his face plastered with the usual obsequious and shameless smile. "It seems necessary to stop for a while so that those ministers can perform the briefest of ceremonies."</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager, however, was not listening to him today and replied very decisively:</p>
<p>"The train is not allowed to stop under any circumstances! There is only one compromise; that is, after our train enters the station, you should first keep a close watch, and when it is closest, you can report back to me!"</p>
<p>Before long, the outline of Tianjin gradually became visible; the Empress Dowager, knowing that Yuan Shikai and his officials would soon be kneeling on the platform to watch us pass by, became more attentive in her preparations. On the one hand, she tidied her own clothes, and on the other hand, she told us not to move around and to stand extra straight. At the same time, the driver had also received a hint and hurriedly reduced the speed of the train. In fact, given the Empress Dowager's status, such a deliberate slowing down of the train to receive their respect was already a great favor: however, the Empress Dowager did indeed attach special importance to Yuan Shikai, and she felt that simply slowing the train was not enough to repay his kindness, so she took a further step in expressing her appreciation.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Telegram Order to Public Servants to Pay Attention to Physical Education</h3>
<p>Nineteen out of ten public servants in various agencies indulge in ease and comfort</p>
<p>Supervising officers should be responsible for promoting and strictly supervising</p>
<p>Each person must choose a sport and practice it regularly</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hankou, 2nd) Chairman Chiang telegraphed an order on the 1st to all agencies to vigorously promote physical education, stating, "To all Pacification Commissioners, Commanders-in-Chief, Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Governments, and forwarded to the Education Department for consideration. It is found that sports are an important task to temper the national physique and build a strong race to save the country, and should be vigorously promoted and universally developed. Therefore, the two skills of archery and horsemanship in ancient China were listed in the six arts as compulsory subjects for scholars and officials. Today, the world's great powers, from top to bottom, and men, women, and children, all have a strong passion for sports and strive continuously. On the other hand, in our country in recent years, although there are many schools in various provinces and cities, they have gradually been able to pay attention to this, but the schools generally focus on the training of a small number of athletes, neglecting the cultivation of all students. As for public servants in various party, government, and military agencies, nineteen out of ten indulge in ease and comfort and have no interest in sports. Such a situation is contrary to the way to transform and build a healthy nation. Therefore, it is strictly ordered that all teachers and students above the middle school level, teachers of various elementary schools, and staff of various party, government, and military agencies must each choose a sport or recreational subject from now on. The responsible officers of each agency and the principals of each school shall be responsible for organizing, strictly supervising, and assigning instructors. Practice must be carried out regularly between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm every day, and between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm in winter, continuously and without interruption. In the event of windy, rainy, or snowy seasons, when outdoor exercise is inconvenient, the responsible officers and the Education Department should consult on remedial measures, so as to maintain consistency and avoid sporadic efforts. This is the only important point. It is hoped that the above instructions will be followed separately, and the party, government, military, and academic institutions of each province will jointly draft a law and implement it earnestly. All levels of agencies and schools in all localities under their jurisdiction should also abide by it. A report should be submitted for record, so that it can be inspected at any time, so as to make a judgment. Chiang Kai-shek, winter."</p>
<h3>Jewish Tenacity Wins in a Hard-Fought Swimming Match</h3>
<p>The result was three to two</p>
<p>The situation was extremely tense</p>
<p>The swimming match between Youyou and the Jewish team took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 at the Shenyuan football field, as one scene of the Western League football A group match. Under the contest, the Jewish people fought desperately, and were able to create a stalemate situation. The competition was quite fierce. In the first half, Youyou led with a score of two to one. The final result was three to two, with Youyou winning.</p>
<p>Youyou launches a frontal attack</p>
<p>Youyou kicked off, taking the initiative. The Jewish team, relying on its inherent bravery, resisted vigorously, advancing and retreating, with uncertain risks. After a melee lasting for five minutes, Luo Haiguang dribbled deep, Chen Shikai shot fiercely, hitting the mark accurately. After a moment, Zhong Yongsheng crossed from the edge, and Sun Jinshun scored with one shot, but it was not counted because of offside. Youyou's momentum was not diminished by this. Zhong Yongsheng rose up from the edge, dribbled into the hinterland, and the two Jewish inside guards blocked the ball with their chests, causing a disaster and being penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Sun Tieleg succeeded immediately, winning by two goals.</p>
<p>The Jewish team pulls back a goal</p>
<p>After losing two goals in a row, the entire Jewish army was filled with indignation and launched a punitive expedition. Pang Queke received the cooperation of the left and right inside forwards and regained a goal. Afterwards, Sun Jinshun had two excellent scoring opportunities, but both were brilliantly saved by the Jewish goalkeeper, which was a pity. Before long, the first half ended, with Youyou leading by two to one.</p>
<p>Each team scores two, resulting in a draw</p>
<p>In the second half, the Jewish team, with its indomitable spirit, launched a desperate counterattack on Youyou's hinterland. For a time, the situation was turbulent. Fortunately, the two inside guards joined forces to defend, avoiding disaster. The Jewish team repeatedly failed to score. The right inside guard, Hashek, had a loss of control in his movements and was sent off the field. From then on, the Jewish team faced the battle with ten men, and the counterattack became even more intense. Toutuo Man and Pang Queke advanced side by side. Wang Shusen and Jiang Shanjing could not stop them, and S. Greenburgh shot angrily, and because it was close, goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai could not save it, resulting in a draw of two goals each.</p>
<p>Youyou plays a triumphant song</p>
<p>With the tie established, the offensive of both sides became more tense. Sun Jinshun was indeed extraordinary, rushing straight in alone. At a considerable position, he kicked the ground, and the ball shot out like an arrow. The Jewish goalkeeper was caught off guard. This ball was kicked very cleanly and was a spectacle. The audience cheered wildly. At this point, the Jewish team's movements became more violent. S. Greenburgh was arrogant and uttered obscenities to the referee and was immediately sent off the field. After a long time, the time was up, and Youyou won against the Jewish team by three to two.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Football Association's Chinese Character Group Final: Two Roads Wins the Championship Against Shanghai Youth</h3>
<p>Result: One to zero</p>
<p>The Two Roads Football Club played against the Shanghai Youth Team in the Chinese Character Group Championship match at the Maigen Road Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00. The spring sunshine was warm that day, and nearly a thousand people admired the game from the sidelines. The Two Roads comrades specially formed a cheering squad to cheer them on, and they were extremely excited. As soon as 3:00 arrived, referee Tang Zhongjun blew the whistle to declare war. The Two Roads team fought unusually hard in the critical moment of the championship. The five forwards linked up and attacked fiercely, giving full play to their abilities. The defenders at the back were also able to perform their duties and had no loopholes. They were able to maintain a perfect defense in the tense situation of 90 minutes. Goalkeeper Tang Wenwei gave even more brilliant performances, and it was not easy to keep his chastity unbroken. In the 30th minute of the first half, Liu Ximeng, the main general of the Two Roads team, received a pass from the right forward and scored a goal. Although there were many strong shots afterwards, none of them succeeded. The generals of the Shanghai Youth Team were all veterans of the battlefield and played brilliantly, but their cooperation was slightly lacking, and they ultimately lost the opportunity to win the championship with a score of one to zero, which was a pity.</p>

<p>Since joining the Chinese Football Association's Ball Character Group, the Weihua B Team has won every match and has been the top team. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, they met the Taiping Team, the only strong team in the group. Taiping possessed Chen Yutian, Chen Hongguang, Gu Shangxiang, etc., and its strength was quite strong. However, Chen Hongguang stayed in Hong Kong and did not return, and Gu Shangxiang was absent due to business. The Taiping team's connection was scattered, and there was no progress. On the other hand, the Weihua generals charged into battle, as if entering an unpopulated area. After 70 minutes of competition, the Weihua team won a big victory with a score of five to one. The Ball Character Group Championship, with a record of seven matches, six wins and one draw, was already in their hands. The Weihua lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Telegrams to Investigate the Educational Administration Performance of Various Counties</h3>
<p>Educational Committee Members of Nan Hui and Other Counties Reprimanded</p>
<p>Jiangpu Educational Committee Member Yu Jingbo Dismissed</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News, Since the Jiangsu Education Department implemented telegrams to investigate the performance of various county bureaus, it has been quite effective. The total number of investigations conducted this year up to February includes over a hundred pieces of performance information from Qidong, Songjiang, Nanhui, Taicang, Haimen, Wujiang, Yixing, Taixing, Huaiyin, Funing, Yancheng, Dongtai, Xinghua, Baoying, Fengxian, Jiangpu, and Yangzhong. Approximately thirty educational committee members from various counties had their inspection reports extracted, all of whom have been sent to the department on schedule for review and return. Detailed instructions and corrections have been added for points that need improvement. The reports of the educational committee members of Nanhui, Funing, and Taixing counties had discrepancies and were all reprimanded. Jiangpu educational committee member Yu Jingbo had a record of repeated reprimands by the Education Department for unsatisfactory work. The telegram investigation of inspection reports this time also failed to be submitted on time, and it was deemed difficult to improve, so he was dismissed. Due to the shortage of disasters in the county's education in the past, there are not many schools now. In order to save administrative expenses, the position of educational committee member will not be temporarily filled. All inspection matters will be the responsibility of the county school superintendent. In addition, the documents of the Jiangpu and Yangzhong county governments on handling the provincial school superintendent's inspection of the schools in each county and the instructions for rectification have also been telegrammed for review. All the ordered matters have been handled separately, showing a practical approach to rectifying local education.</p>

<h3>National Shanghai College of Commerce New Campus Holds Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>
<p>The construction of the new campus of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, undertaken by the local Lu Genji Construction Company, has commenced. President Pei Fuheng of the college has spared no effort in supervising the construction, so the work has been progressing very quickly. Yesterday, a groundbreaking ceremony was specially invited, attended by Minister Lei Zhen from the Ministry of Education, Li Dachao from the Municipal Government, Jiang Jianbai from the Education Bureau, Wu Songgao from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jin Tongyin and other representatives from industry and commerce and various schools, as well as more than 600 faculty, students, and alumni.

<p>— Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Meeting Affairs: On that day, the college temporarily decorated the meeting place, fully hanging Party and national flags and school flags. On both walls were congratulatory messages from the National Shanghai Medical College and the College's Alumni Association, which were very eye-catching.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: First, President Pei, as chairman, delivered a speech, stating briefly that after the college's campus was destroyed by artillery fire during the Shanghai War, it had experienced various difficulties. In recent years, thanks to the guidance of Minister of Education Wang and the efforts of all faculty and students, the college's affairs had returned to normal and progressed in an orderly manner. Now, it was the first to restore the campus in the war zone, so holding the groundbreaking ceremony today was deeply commemorative. In the future, it will further expand the campus to become the only perfect institution of higher learning for commercial studies. He hoped that the Ministry of Education and all sectors would continue to provide assistance, and that faculty and students would become more motivated to cultivate talented and skilled commercial talents, to modernize Chinese commerce, strive for economic construction, and complete the college's mission, which would be very fortunate. Finally, he thanked the guests for attending the ceremony. Minister Lei Zhen, representing Minister of Education Wang, then gave a speech, stating the general idea that, the College of Commerce is located in a major trading port and is also the only national commercial institution, and the government has high expectations. Therefore, even in a state of financial difficulty, it still allocated funds to build the campus. Today, at a time when Chinese commerce is depressed and the economy is declining, enrollment has increased sharply, and domestic products cannot be promoted in the international market.  [sentence fragment due to damaged text], striving to revitalize commerce and modernize it, is the only way to compete with others, increase national wealth, and lay the foundation for the country. Everyone should take this to heart and pursue advanced studies, not to betray the government's intention to cultivate commercial talents. Mayor Wu's representative, Li Dachao, then gave a speech, briefly stating that the reconstruction of the College of Commerce campus not only shows the government's emphasis on commercial education, but also the result of President Pei's leadership of faculty and students. The Municipal Government expresses its deep pleasure and intends to provide assistance for its early completion. The construction plan for the Greater Shanghai Municipality is currently underway in various ways. After the completion of various cultural institutions in the urban area, it will provide the College of Commerce with many conveniences. It is hoped that everyone will bury their heads in hard work, hoping to contribute what they have learned to the country and the nation. Finally, Jiang Jianbai, representing the Education Bureau, gave a speech, stating that in recent years, the domestic atmosphere of studying has plummeted. The College of Commerce is uniquely able to reverse the decline and create a good academic atmosphere. Now that there is this new campus, there will certainly be more satisfactory results. It is hoped that the faculty and students of the College of Commerce will come out and transform the academic atmosphere, from near to far, and extend it to the whole country, one is to strive for the construction of culture, and the other is to fulfill its task of universally promoting culture, so the revival of the nation can be expected. After the speeches, the groundbreaking ceremony was held, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Overview of Domestic Diseases and Epidemic Prevention Measures in the 23rd Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>— Shen Bao Yearbook Society</p>
<p>(A) Plague... This year, only Fujian Province reported plague cases nationwide; however, the number was small, with 16 cases found in Suxitou, and 11 cases found in Tieshiyang Village near Longyan City. Although there were reports of plague in the province again until November, the results were inconclusive as they were not verified and confirmed by bacteriologists.</p>
<p>(B) Cholera... Cholera was rarely found throughout the country this year. Only six cases have been verified, the first one found in Guangzhou on June 9th, two found in Hankou on July 4th, and the remaining three found in Shanghai on July 19th and 28th, and all were chronic and soon cured. In addition, suspected cholera patients were scattered in cities and towns in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Qingdao. Major cities still held large-scale vaccination campaigns as in previous years. In Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the concession health authorities, and the railway health office worked together to carry out vaccinations. By the end of August, a total of 749,625 people had been vaccinated. At the same time, the water company also provided drinking water to the poor, and the health authorities sent personnel to various well locations to carry out disinfection work.</p>
<p>(C) Kala-azar... In China, according to past survey reports, Kala-azar is often found in all of Shandong and Hebei, most of Shanxi, and eastern Henan and Shaanxi, as well as northern Jiangsu and Anhui. In June of this year, the Health Experiment Department of the National Economic Commission established a Kala-azar research team in Qingjiangpu, Jiangsu, to study the treatment and prevention of Kala-azar. According to reports, the team conducted surveys in ten villages from August to December using very precise methods. Among 982 people, 242 suffered from Kala-azar, accounting for 24% of the total population. The team also established hospitals and clinics in the area. As of the end of this year, a total of 201 patients had been hospitalized and 691 new patients had been treated as outpatients.</p>
<p>(D) Leprosy... In recent years, the Chinese people have gradually paid attention to leprosy patients, which can be proved by the enthusiastic establishment of leprosy hospitals and clinics by the government and private organizations this year. Among them, the Chinese Leprosy Association's construction of a leprosy hospital in Wusong, Shanghai with a huge sum of 100,000 yuan is particularly eye-catching. According to reliable estimates, there are a total of 3 million leprosy patients in the world, and China accounts for one-third—one million; however, as far as the reporter knows, there are currently only 23 leprosy hospitals, 17 clinics, and 9 leprosy villages in China, with only about 5,000 people receiving treatment. Therefore, the urgent need to solve the leprosy problem in our country is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>(E) Tuberculosis... How was the situation of tuberculosis in our country in the past? So far, no detailed statistics have been seen, so there is no way to know the real situation. However, according to the results of surveys in Hong Kong, Beiping, and Shanghai, it is known that the number of Chinese people suffering from tuberculosis is not small. The Shanghai China Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established in 1933 and is currently conducting ongoing investigations into tuberculosis patients, and is widely publicizing the importance of the disease to attract the attention of the Chinese people. Not long ago, the association held a conference in Shanghai, bringing together experts from all over the country to jointly discuss various issues related to tuberculosis, and the results were quite good. In Beiping, significant progress has also been made in tuberculosis prevention work recently. There are currently eight tuberculosis institutions with 296 beds. In 1929, there were only two such institutions with five beds. In addition, the Beiping Tuberculosis Hospital is currently being planned and constructed. Its main purpose is to train specialized personnel in tuberculosis prevention and to organize a sanatorium and a tuberculosis public health research institute.</p>
<p>(F) Smallpox and Diphtheria... The importance of preventing and treating smallpox has been generally recognized. Therefore, local health administrative agencies attach importance to vaccination work every year. During the period from July 1933 to June 1934, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau alone carried out 246,063 smallpox vaccinations. The attention paid to smallpox by the Chinese people can be seen from this. As for diphtheria, the health authorities of cities such as Beiping and Nanjing also carried out large-scale prevention campaigns this year. According to statistics, the number of vaccinations in Beiping was 4,905, and in Nanjing was 9,038.</p>
<p>(G) Dysentery, Malaria, and Beriberi... According to surveys conducted by the Health Experiment Department in hospitals in Nanchang, Linchuan, Nanzheng, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Baishui, Yiqian, Fengcheng, Changshu, Ji'an, and Taihe in November and December of this year, these three diseases are very severe. Among hospitalized patients, those suffering from dysentery account for about 50%, and malaria and beriberi account for about 25%.</p>
<p>(H) Schistosomiasis... Regarding the work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has jointly conducted research with the Health Experiment Department, and has established a task force for the prevention and treatment of Japanese schistosomiasis in Qu County and Hangzhou, engaged in the study of the life history of snails and the treatment of patients. According to research reports, it has been proven that water buffalo and dogs are the vectors of this disease. The Hangzhou team has also established two sub-teams: (1) a task force for the prevention and control of fasciolopsiasis, stationed in Xiaoshan, in cooperation with the Xiaoshan Xianghu Normal School in Zhejiang, in addition to medical work, it also engages in various research work. (2) A task force for the prevention and control of pulmonary paragonimiasis, stationed in Shaoxing, studying the life history of pulmonary paragonimus and examining snails, crabs, livestock, and wild animals.</p>
<h3>Skin Hygiene and Prevention of Skin Diseases</h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Prevention is better than cure." Therefore, instead of having the best methods to treat diseases, it is better to understand preventive measures to prevent diseases from occurring. This is more time-saving and convenient. Paying attention to skin hygiene can not only prevent skin diseases, but also have a beneficial effect on the internal organs of the whole body, because the relationship between the two is very close. Originally, the skin wraps our entire body and comes into contact with everything in the outside world, like the first line of defense in wartime, resisting all external stimuli and protecting the peace of the internal organs. At the same time, the stronger the skin, the more it can promote the activity of the internal organs. This is the relationship between the skin and the internal organs. However, the health of the internal organs is also related to the skin. For example, when a certain organ has a disease, many changes can occur on the skin. For example, people with heart disease and lung disease often have a haggard appearance. The luster and color of their skin are also not radiant, but completely pale. Also, the complexion of people with insomnia and neurasthenia is often not healthy. The skin of people with jaundice is yellow, and the skin of people with cancer is earthy. When we see changes on the skin, we can infer what kind of changes are happening in the internal organs. Therefore, to prevent skin diseases, in addition to studying ways to strengthen the skin itself, we must also pay attention to the health of the whole body in order to achieve the real purpose of prevention.</p>
<p>What is skin hygiene? In practice, it aims to maintain and enhance the health of the skin. That is, strong skin is resistant to external stimuli. Even if a disease invades, it can resist it, or even if it cannot be completely avoided, it will not become a serious illness. This is the primary meaning of prevention. However, when it comes to skin hygiene, it is also related to beauty techniques, because most skin diseases are detrimental to beauty. The purpose of most patients seeking medical treatment is also to worry about the damage to their beauty. Therefore, treating skin diseases not only relieves the patient's pain, but also pays attention to the beauty aspect.</p>
<p>Speaking of the meaning of beauty, from our medical common sense, the appearance wrapped in diseased skin is not beautiful and is ugly. If we can promote the health of the skin, we can naturally maintain its beauty. That is, paying attention to skin hygiene can promote its beauty. In other words, true beauty can only be found in healthy skin. Therefore, to protect the beauty of the skin, it is essential to pay attention to skin hygiene.</p>
<p>According to what has been said above, skin hygiene, in addition to paying attention to the nutrition of the whole body, also requires attention to strengthening the skin. Strong skin can not only enhance the skin's resistance to external stimuli, but also enable the skin's physiological functions to develop fully, giving weak skin vigorous vitality. The way to strengthen the skin is to train it with air and sunlight being the most necessary. Direct contact with the cold and warmth is important to train a habit of resistance. This is even more important in childhood where the effects are more significant. For example, when going out, wrapping children heavily with gloves and scarves, wearing thick leather clothing, and using hats and umbrellas to block the sunlight are all inappropriate because meaningless fear of cold and small breezes will only make the skin weaker. A slight carelessness will lead to colds. Therefore, such habits should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Exposure to fresh air is also one of the important conditions for hygiene. Regardless of winter or summer, whenever the weather is good, it is best to walk in the suburbs, forests, or countryside. This can make metabolism active and blood circulation vigorous, resulting in a beneficial effect on the skin. Outdoor exercise is extremely beneficial to the skin, especially bathing in sunlight, which has even greater effects. This is because the temperature of sunlight, acting on the skin, not only enhances the skin's function, but also the important ultraviolet rays in sunlight are absorbed into the human body, causing vitamins to be produced in the blood (this is called anti-rickets nutrients), making metabolism obviously vigorous. At the same time, direct stimulation of the skin invigorates physiological functions, not only increasing the skin's resistance, but also, due to the great bactericidal power of light, killing various bacteria attached to the skin. When we treat patients with artificial sun lamps, even for a short time, patients often feel refreshed, breathe smoothly, have a full pulse, feel physically energized, and full of vitality. The skin of farmers in the countryside and outdoor workers is mostly strong, not because they were born that way, but because they are accustomed to strong winds and blazing sun from childhood, bathing in sunlight. It is the result of long-term training. If someone wants to quickly change their lifestyle, do strenuous exercise, or give themselves drastic stimulation, it would be dangerous. Being able to gradually pay attention to training and practice, once accustomed, one can naturally obtain healthy skin.</p>
<p>Cold water bath and cold water friction are good ways to train the skin. Cold water bath is very intense and only suitable for adults. It is mostly unsuitable for the elderly, children and women. In winter, more attention should be paid as there is a risk of catching a cold. People who usually use cold water bath often feel some shivering in the bath. Therefore, when entering the bath, it should be stopped when the hair stands on end and immediately get out of the bath, using a dry towel to rub vigorously until the whole body is warm. If it is too cold, adding some hot water is okay.</p>
<p>Cold water friction is easier to implement than cold water bath. It involves using a handkerchief or towel soaked in cold water to rub the skin of the whole body, starting from the shoulders and reaching the chest, back, abdomen, both wrists, buttocks, etc. Rapidly rub the skin. The timing of implementation is the same as for cold water bath. It is best to do it when getting up in the morning, or it can also be done before going to bed. Both of these methods stimulate the skin</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>nerves. Appropriate implementation can make blood circulation vigorous and the skin strong, which is very beneficial for the health of the whole body.</p>
<p>Dry friction is the safest method, and it is easy for women and children to implement. Use a dry towel to rub the skin of the whole body. The order of friction is the same as for cold water friction, starting from the shoulders and reaching the feet. Or, instead of using a towel, one can quietly rub the skin with their own palms. Some people with sensitive skin often find it difficult to implement cold water friction or dry friction. One can first rub with the palms, and after getting used to it, then use cold water friction.</p>
<p>Seawater bath can also be regarded as a kind of cold water friction. However, the saltiness contained in seawater has no special significance for the skin. Sometimes, it often worsens certain skin diseases, such as eczema, prurigo, etc., when exposed to sea tides and wind. However, bathing in the sea, due to the swaying of the waves, stimulates the nerves of the skin, making physiological functions vigorous. At the same time, lying naked in the sand on the beach for a sunbath is truly killing two birds with one stone. It is an excellent opportunity for skin training.</p>
<p>Warm water bath can dilate the blood vessels of the skin and promote sweat secretion, which can promote metabolism. In a short period of time, it can make the mind refreshed and is very important for hygiene. Especially when taking a warm bath, using a brush or sponge to remove dirt and rub the skin of the whole body can help nourish the skin. However, to train the skin and prevent colds, cold water and dry friction are relatively better. Hot water bath can cleanse the skin, which is also very important for hygiene.</p>
<p>In short, people with sensitive skin are prone to skin diseases and colds. Often use the above methods to train the skin, continuing to implement it between winter and summer. Weak skin can become strong, and a considerable preventive effect can be obtained for colds and skin diseases. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Communication in Chinese and Polish Medical Circles</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yinming</p>
<p>Two Polish Doctors Visit China to Take Office in the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>Professor Weigl Invents Typhoid Fever Vaccine</p>
<p>Polish medicine also enjoys a considerable reputation in the world. For example, the University of Krakow and the University of Lviv have made significant contributions to medical research. However, there has been little historical connection between the Chinese and Polish medical communities. In June 1933, two famous young Polish doctors, Weinert and Willeski, were enthusiastic about the study of medical psychology, especially various problems in psychopathology. They came to Asia for field study, passing through Romania, Soviet Russia, Turkey, Persia, India, Penang, Singapore, and Hong Kong to reach Shanghai. They contacted the Chinese Medical Association and served at the Suzhou Mental Hospital for one month. They then joined the Sino-Polish Cultural Association. In 1934, the Examination Yuan hired Weinert as the director of the Health Department and Willeski as a health consultant. Both were able to fulfill their duties. Willeski traveled north for three months, working in the neurology department of the Peking Union Medical College. Weinert accompanied President Dai Jitao and the Panchen Lama to Hangzhou last summer to preside over various health affairs. The two left China for Japan on December 17 last year and then went to the Americas. They are scheduled to return to Poland in June of this year to complete their world tour and field research feat. The two have lived in China for more than a year and a half, and their medical skills have won the trust of all parties. The relationship between the Chinese and Polish medical communities has become increasingly close. There are many Polish priests who have stayed in China as missionaries, especially in North China, and many have established hospitals for medical treatment. The most famous is the Polish Catholic Eye Hospital in Shunde, Hebei. According to precise statistics, 75% of Polish missionaries who came to China died of typhoid fever. In 1930, Professor Weigl, director of the Biology Department of the University of Lviv in Poland, invented the most effective typhoid fever vaccine. After years of experimentation and immersed in practical work, he finally achieved success. The following year, Father Luton brought the Weigl typhoid fever vaccine to China and conducted preventive injections in various Catholic churches with remarkable results. The Weigl typhoid fever vaccine was initially manufactured only in Professor Weigl's laboratory. In 1931, the Belgian Catholic Church in Beiping requested Professor Weigl in Poland to disclose the formula for local manufacturing due to satisfactory trial results. The professor replied with a telegram of approval. The church then sent Dr. Zhang Hanmin to Poland to study with the professor, staying in Poland for two months and obtaining the manufacturing method before returning. Therefore, the Belgian Catholic Church in Beiping was also able to manufacture this vaccine thereafter. The mortality rate of Polish priests was sharply reduced after this preventive injection. The Weigl typhoid fever vaccine is only prevalent among various Catholic churches in China and has not been widely used. It is hoped that the Chinese medical community can give it due research. At the National Pharmaceutical Conference held in the capital from October 3 last year, Doctors Zhang Hanmin and Luo Zhong mentioned Professor Weigl's new invention, which aroused considerable attention from the entire audience. The Pope awarded Professor Weigl the honorary title of Bishop of St. Gregory in recognition of his meritorious invention.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(54) Beriberi</p>
<p>(Q) What is Beriberi?</p>
<p>(A) Beriberi is a systemic nutritional disorder, a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin B1 in the diet.</p>
<p>(Q) Where does Beriberi occur most frequently?</p>
<p>(A) Mostly in places where white rice is the main food, like parts of East Asia, South America, and Africa.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the lack of Vitamin B1 in food the sole cause of Beriberi?</p>
<p>(A) Most scholars have decided that the cause of Beriberi is the lack of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) in food. However, true Beriberi may not be exactly the same as Vitamin B1 deficiency in humans. However, except for the heart symptoms, the other symptoms are very similar.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the difference in heart symptoms between Beriberi and Vitamin B1 deficiency in humans?</p>
<p>(A) Heart symptoms are very significant in Beriberi; while circulatory symptoms are not very obvious in Vitamin B1 deficiency in humans. However, digestive disorders are very severe.</p>
<p>(Q) What theories are there today to explain the cause of Beriberi?</p>
<p>(A) There are two theories: poisoning and infection.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the poisoning theory?</p>
<p>(A) The poisoning theory is white rice poisoning. This theory is more powerful, because Beriberi is only seen in populations that eat white rice. Also, bird white rice disease is similar to Beriberi, because white rice has had the important vitamins in the bran removed.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the infection theory?</p>
<p>(A) The starting point of the infection theory is that Beriberi is epidemic and related to the seasons of the year. However, fewer people believe this theory.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the predisposing factors for Beriberi?</p>
<p>(A) There are many predisposing factors: First, warmth and humidity, so it is more common in the hot and humid summer, followed by spring and autumn, and less common in winter. Second, excessive exercise or lack of exercise. Third, mental fatigue. Fourth, various infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, influenza, tuberculosis, kidney disease, anemia, diabetes, wasting diseases, and pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a relationship between Beriberi and constitution?</p>
<p>(A) There is no certainty as to whether there is a constitution that is prone to Beriberi. However, Beriberi is more common in people with acquired nervousness or thymolymphatic constitution.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a relationship between Beriberi and age and gender?</p>
<p>(A) More common in adult males, most common from 15 to 25 years old, and less common in young people and the elderly.</p>

<p>(37) The Reason Why the Eye Can See (Continued)</p>
<p>Emmetropia</p>
<p>Because the retina is covered with optic nerves, which can cause vision. Also, if the distance between the condensing lens and the film in a camera can be arbitrarily stretched (telescopic bellows), the image can be made clearer. The same effect also occurs in the eyeball, because the crystalline lens can change its curvature at will according to the distance of the object through the action of the ciliary muscle (Figure 11), thereby making the image clearly projected onto the retina. This action is the adjustment action of the eyeball.</p>
<p>By observing the structure and physiological function of the eye mentioned above, we can naturally understand the reason why the eye can see. Therefore, my conclusion is... When the light of an object enters the cornea of our eyeball, it is refracted by the crystalline lens and transmitted to the visual center of the brain through the optic nerve of the retina to produce vision. Furthermore, the adjustment of the eyeball makes this image particularly clear.</p>
<p>The establishment of emmetropia is achieved by the implementation of the functions possessed by the camera, as described in the previous section "The Reason Why the Eye Can See." This emmetropic eye is an eyeball with ordinary and sound vision. Its ability can adjust the iris, refract the crystalline lens, and use its natural adjustment to completely project the image produced by light, whether far or near, onto the retina (refer to the attached diagram). Therefore, objects near and far can be seen clearly and are not subject to any restrictions. Also, there is no need for the assistance of corrective glasses. The ability of this eyeball is completely in line with the function of a camera. Personnel who wish to serve in the army, aviation, customs, and pilotage, etc., can always pass the eyesight test without any problem if they have this type of emmetropic eye.</p>

<h3>Medical Pain Relief (4)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Beneficial and Harmless Pain Relief Techniques</p>
<p>(1) Rest: Generally speaking, pain requires rest. No matter what kind of pain, it is necessary to rest when the pain is aggravated by movement. For example, if a red eye hurts severely, resting the eye is necessary in addition to applying eye drops. The same is true for pain in other parts of the body. When any part of the body is inflamed or injured and painful, it should be rested. Resting an inflamed part can, one, reduce pain, and two, help the body's repair work to recover its original state quickly. This method is very common and everyone can do it. It seems that there is no value in describing it, but it is not. Although it is very common, it is very important in the method of pain relief. Special attention should be paid.</p>
<p>(2) Lying Position: The patient should rest in bed in a certain lying position that makes him feel less pain. If there is such a lying position, help him achieve it. For example, sometimes it is necessary to raise the swollen part of the body to make blood flow back easily, which can reduce pain. Here is an example. I used to have a patient with heart disease. He was fine in the hospital. Later, he went home. After returning home, his illness worsened again, and he returned to the hospital. I saw that his legs were very swollen and he felt bloated and painful. I immediately asked him to lie on the bed and raised the bed at his feet and legs, so that his lower limbs were raised about 80 degrees. In less than half an hour, the swelling of his legs completely disappeared, and he no longer felt pain. From this, it can be seen that a suitable posture is also of considerable value. Suitable postures must also be changed from time to time. If a lying position is maintained for too long, it is easy to make the limbs inflexible.</p>
<p>(3) Activity: Rest is of course the most important thing, but activity should also begin at the appropriate time. For example, when a bone is broken, after the bone is set, it must be kept completely still for a month or two to allow the fracture to heal completely, but when it does not hinder the broken bone, it should be moved. The same is true for all inflamed parts. Once it is about to heal, it should be moved. In this way, the initial activity may inevitably be slightly painful, but continued activity will show progress. When starting to move, the force must be gradually increased from light to heavy, and the time must be gradually increased from short to long. Do not overdo it to avoid injury to the inflamed area.

<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (43)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Clinical Course</p>
<p>Now we can mention the complete types, the general situation of exudative and proliferative! Attached to these two, there are also several sub-items of distinction; this has been mentioned in the chapter on pathological anatomy. Regarding the characteristics of each of their types, it would of course be very tedious to describe them one by one; here, it is better to single out two significant types, caseous pneumonia and acute miliary tuberculosis; because they are relatively common in clinical practice, and one represents exudative and the other represents proliferative. The detailed course of both sides is now described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Caseous Pneumonia This is the most serious type. It is acute and sudden in onset. At the beginning, it develops a high fever, which can reach 39 or 40 degrees Celsius. This, on the surface, is very similar to typhoid fever, sepsis, pyemia, and other symptoms in acute infectious diseases. It is especially similar to ordinary acute pneumonia, but the initial state of shivering is less common! Dullness appears in the lungs, and bronchial breathing sounds appear during auscultation. These are very significant lung changes, and the state of dissolution is not very visible. High fever remains and does not subside, forming a remittent fever type. The sputum is purulent at the beginning, sometimes appearing green, and rusty color is rarely seen; there are many tuberculosis bacteria and elastic fibers in the sputum, which is the only proof and the difference from ordinary pneumonia. But at the beginning, sometimes it is not seen in the specimen. Protein sometimes appears in the urine, the spleen is enlarged, the blood image shows a serious toxic state, the white blood cell count increases, polynuclear cells increase, lymphocytes decrease, and the blood sedimentation rate also increases. The trend of caseous pneumonia is mostly from an acute and serious state, falling into incurable within a few weeks. If this acute difficult point is passed, the temperature is lower at this time, and other general conditions will also be slightly better; but the discovery of cavities is inevitable, and the result becomes chronic cavitary disease! This, in the final result, is also mostly bad. In terms of diagnosis, it is relatively difficult to distinguish from pneumonia, lung abscess, and other symptoms. The most important aspect of this is to tirelessly inquire about the medical history and perform a precise examination of the sputum! X-ray examination also has some help. As for its cause, apart from a part that occurs directly in healthy people, most of it is a complication of each stage of pulmonary tuberculosis; in other words, the last step of every type of pulmonary tuberculosis is that many develop caseous pneumonia as a final ending.</p>

<h3>On Rural Investment</h3>
<p>— Wei Dong</p>
<p>In recent years, the decline of China's rural economy has drawn widespread attention. Calls for relief have resonated across the nation. Under the leadership of the central government, organizations such as the Rural Rehabilitation Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Council have been established. Under the jurisdiction of local governments, various rural relief committees have been set up by provincial, municipal, and county governments. In the private sector, charitable organizations have launched disaster relief efforts, and the banking sector has engaged in rural investment. In particular, the advocacy and implementation of rural investment by the banking sector have been more vigorous and rapid than other rural movements. Here, we will examine and discuss several points under the popular topic of "Rural Investment by the Banking Sector."</p>
<p>1. Why Do Banks Invest in Rural Areas?</p>
<p>To understand why banks invest in rural areas, one does not need in-depth research. A simple examination of the dynamics of the banking industry itself will reveal their primary motives. In theory, the establishment of banks is to serve society, concentrating idle funds on the one hand and providing working capital to industry, agriculture, and commerce on the other. However, it is not a charitable organization dedicated solely to helping others. Setting aside theory and looking at the reality, the greatest ambition of most bank operators is simply: (1) to profit from the difference between high lending rates and low deposit rates, and (2) to seek surplus by engaging in various speculative or near-speculative activities using their concentrated financial strength. Chinese banks have always held this view. In recent years, the Chinese economy, under the dual pressure of an increasingly severe global economic crisis and widespread rural collapse across the country, has declined rapidly. Naturally, the banking industry within the Chinese economic sphere has also faced significant harm. Regarding their first ambition, after the bankruptcy of the rural economy, agricultural funds flowing into commercial cities could no longer return to the countryside for agricultural production. Instead, they were deposited in banks to earn interest, leading to a large increase in bank deposits. At the same time, the massive influx of foreign manufactured goods damaged China's fledgling national industries. The decline in the purchasing power of the general population led to the decline of commerce nationwide. As a result, factories and shops closed down one after another, shaking the foundation of bank lending and causing a sharp decrease in the amount of loans issued. The development of these two divergent trends caused the balance between bank deposits and loans to be lost. In 1932, the total deposits of all 146 banks in the country amounted to 2,183,959,957 yuan, while the total loans amounted to 1,946,864,137 yuan (reference: 1934 Banking Yearbook published by the Bank of China). The ratio of loans to deposits was still 89%. However, by 1933, the decrease in this ratio was somewhat alarming. Taking only the operations of the 57 major banks and trust companies generally recognized, total deposits had reached 2,032,014,626 yuan, which was nearly the same as the deposits of all 146 banks in 1932. However, loans in 1933 were only 1,385,537,852 yuan (reference: "Statistics on the Business Reports of Banks and Trust Companies in 1933" by Pan Hengmin, Central Bank Monthly, Vol. 3, No. 10). The ratio of loans to deposits had dropped to 68%. After 1933, China's economic situation not only did not improve but became even worse than before. Judging by the overall trend, the ratio of loans to deposits in 1934 was probably even smaller than in the previous year. Regarding their second ambition, Chinese banks in the past, due to environmental and historical reasons, could not compete with foreign banks in China in the operation of modern financial businesses. For traditional financial activities, money shops and native banks had already divided their spheres of influence, not allowing banks to intervene. As a result, their business gradually drifted into an abnormal state of development, following foreign banks and specializing in various speculative activities. The most important of these were real estate investment and short selling and buying of public bonds. Secondly, they provided loans for various risky ventures, such as cinemas, dog racing tracks, or entertainment venues similar to gambling institutions. Taking Shanghai as an example, tall buildings are everywhere. Looking at their names, they are either a certain bank's building or a certain bank's villa. Various exchanges and margin trading markets not only have daytime trading but some even advocate nighttime trading. As for the development of tea houses, theaters, and other entertainment venues, it coincided exactly with the collapse of the countryside. When the Chinese rural economy first went bankrupt in 1932, this prosperity decorated the major commercial cities very lavishly. However, this prosperity was only a manifestation of the concentration of idle funds without proper productive use. Without a sound rural economy as its foundation, it was like a building built on floating sand, and soon various dangers were discovered, threatening collapse. In addition, foreign aggression occurred. After the Northeast Incident, the Shanghai War followed, and North China and South China were frequently unstable. As a result, the non-standard businesses operated by various banks gradually encountered difficulties. The masses who flowed into commercial cities due to rural bankruptcy could not rent the luxurious buildings built by the banking industry. The decline of domestic Chinese industries, the instability of the situation, and the ever-changing monetary policies of various capitalist countries made it difficult for the banking industry to operate short selling and buying businesses.</p>
<p>Bank operators are the smartest businessmen. They would never allow other people's cash to stay in their own vaults just because the above two ambitions have failed, and still have to pay others a large amount of interest. If their old profit-making methods are ineffective, they can open up new profit routes. Thus, the operation of agricultural lending has attracted their attention. Agricultural loans are mostly secured by agricultural products and land, especially land. Land, in the eyes of bankers wearing gold-rimmed glasses, is the most rigid real estate. In the past, not only did commercial banks not have the idea of "investing in rural areas," but even banks named after agriculture and industry abandoned their responsibilities and preferred to compete with commercial banks in the same business. However, in these extraordinary times, land in agriculture, although it is one of the factors of production like machinery in industry, its stability is much stronger than that of machinery. Because China is a large agricultural country, more than 80% of the people are farmers. The stagnation of industrial production cannot completely eliminate the opportunities for survival of the Chinese people. Agricultural production is an indispensable survival function for the Chinese people. Even if the Chinese economy continues to decline relentlessly, agriculture is still standing on the last stage.</p>
<p>Why do Chinese banks invest in rural areas? Simply put, it is to find a way out for their excessive deposits. If you have to put a charitable mask of "relieving the countryside" on the faces of bankers, you can only say that bankers want to increase the purchasing power of the general public to encourage the prosperity of industry and commerce, and through the prosperity of industry and commerce to develop their lending to industry and commerce. They have to restore the productive capacity of the countryside, so they want to relieve the countryside and invest in the countryside.</p>
<p>2. Technical Issues of Rural Investment</p>
<p>The methods used by the Chinese banking industry for rural investment can be divided into three types: (1) agricultural warehouse loans, (2) farmer mortgage loans, and (3) cooperative loans. The first two methods are directly operated by the banks themselves and do not need to be discussed here. The third method is to use cooperatives as an intermediary between the banking industry and the countryside, which is also the most popular social movement in recent times. Currently, the cooperatives led by the banking industry include production cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, production and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives. Cooperatives are a modern economic organization, the main purpose of which is to avoid exploitation between producers and consumers. In Europe, America, and the Soviet Union, this organization is quite common. However, the emergence of a social movement or social organization is determined by the social environment and needs. For example, the Soviet Union can implement socialism, but the United States currently does not have this need. Furthermore, the representative system that has been popular in politics in recent centuries can maintain its excellent characteristics in European and American countries, but when implemented in our country, many shortcomings of bribery during elections were discovered in the early years of the Republic of China. Although the theory of cooperatives is good, it does not necessarily become popular in China immediately. Even if China can have such cooperative organizations, under the rush movement, it may not be able to reach the true conditions of cooperatives, because the masses participating in this organization should at least reach a certain level of cultural level. To be honest, China is a culturally backward country, and all progress is a deformity. The economic situation is like this, and the education situation is also like this. A small number of people who have received higher education can talk about socialism and Asian production methods, but most of the people are fundamentally illiterate and do not know what economics is. It is absolutely impossible to organize 320,000 cooperatives like the Soviet Union now, because the Soviet Union has now eradicated illiteracy. What about China? At least I am afraid that more than half of the people are illiterate. Perhaps some people will say that all social movements gradually develop. We must know that the bankruptcy of the Chinese rural economy now seems to be a "stroke" of acute illness. Hoping to relieve the countryside through cooperatives is like hoping that children will grow up to study medicine and then treat the disease. The urgency and the slowness are different. If we must quickly popularize the organization of cooperatives, in the author's prejudice, I feel that there are the following difficulties.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of personnel organizing cooperatives Because of the lack of knowledge of general farmers, all the organization and operation of cooperatives can only completely rely on the leaders engaged in the cooperative movement. Currently, the talents in China who can lead the organization of cooperatives are only the highly educated class who have received cooperative education and the local gentry who have authority in the countryside. Taking the former talents as an example, the highly educated class who have been baptized in the 20th century, read foreign books, and wear foreign clothes may not be able to get used to the rural life that is still in the 18th and 19th centuries. Perhaps there will be jokes like agricultural students in universities being afraid of mud getting their suit pants dirty. At the same time, students who are used to reading foreign books may not be able to understand the situation in the Chinese countryside, and illiterate farmers may not be able to accept Western civilization. The author once heard someone engaged in the agricultural cooperative movement say the following: "The matter of cooperatives is very easy. You get a salary of dozens of dollars a month, and there are also dozens of dollars for office expenses. Office expenses can be used to buy personal things. When you are transferred, all the things bought with office expenses can be brought by individuals, because this is a test nature. As for the work, it is not hard. The people who come to inspect from above will not necessarily ask you in detail. You can just talk nonsense and get by. If someone visits, it doesn’t matter, because they don’t even understand what cooperation is." This can represent the achievements of cooperative undertakings led by the educated class. Taking the latter talents as an example, the local gentry are the authorities in the countryside, and most of them are landlords above the rich peasants. Although they do not know what cooperation is, they know how to exploit the farmers. The result of the cooperative established under this special force is to change the previous individual oppression of farmers into collective oppression of farmers. The farmers themselves have not been relieved of the pain of being exploited.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of capital collection for cooperatives Banks lend to the countryside through cooperatives, so before farmers can obtain bank loans, they must first organize cooperatives. The organization of cooperatives requires members to contribute capital. In the current extreme poverty of the rural economy, general farmers will not have surplus capital to be used as cooperative capital. Although the amount of cooperative shares is very small, most tenant farmers and owner-cultivators almost always return agricultural products to general usurers after the harvest season, and then borrow money from usurers to maintain their lives. In this repeated borrowing life, not only is it impossible to participate in cooperatives, but general usurers may not allow them to break away from the bondage of usury. As a result, the so-called agricultural cooperatives are nothing more than exploitative groups organized by a small number of landlords using capital, using the strong power of financial capital to intensify the economic oppression of farmers.</p>
<p>From the above two points of view, it can be determined that China's cooperative undertakings are somewhat different from the cooperative undertakings in Europe and America. Last year, British cooperative credit expert Strickland</p>
<p>Report after inspecting cooperatives in Shaanxi, Hebei, and Hubei provinces: (Ta Kung Pao, December 12, 1934) In the three provinces he inspected, none of the cooperatives had audited their accounts, which shows that the cooperative organization is not sound. Another example is the rural relief movement in Zhejiang last year. There were 42 agricultural financial institutions and as many as 1,072 cooperatives in the province. Everyone thought that the greatest success would be achieved in the end; unexpectedly, hope is hope, and the fact is the fact. According to the report of the Zhejiang Provincial Production Conference, in terms of the stacking situation in Lanxi County, "the limit on the amount of mortgage is very high. It must be mortgaged for 20 yuan or more than 50 yuan. Small and medium farmers certainly do not have such a large output. As a result, 80% to 90% of the mortgagors buy agricultural products at low prices and mortgage them to the stack to wait for the price to sell, and use the mortgage income as funds to buy agricultural products at low prices." This is even more obvious that the cooperative undertakings are manipulated by a small number of wealthy people, and the effect is to intensify the exploitation of farmers.</p>
<p>The author never opposes cooperative undertakings in theory, but in fact, cooperative undertakings need to be promoted by cultural level. As mentioned above, the collapse of the Chinese rural economy is a "stroke" of an acute illness, and the cooperative is only a future doctor. If you call him to complete the ten-year school course that the doctor should study in ten days, the result must be a quack doctor. We also need to know that the decline of the Chinese rural economy now is the production bankruptcy of tenant farmers and small owner-cultivators. These tenant farmers and owner-cultivators account for the absolute majority of Chinese farmers, and the current cooperatives seem to only help rich farmers and large landlords to improve seeds and agricultural mechanization. It is of no benefit to farmers who rely solely on physical strength to survive. Therefore, China's cooperative undertakings only had 3,618 societies in 1931, and increased to 9,948 societies in 1934. Among them, agricultural cooperative societies increased from 3,328 societies to 9,578 societies (National Cooperative Society Statistics), but China's agricultural panic did not abate as a result. This is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>3. The Future of Rural Investment and Land Issues</p>
<p>The collapse of China's rural economy, natural disasters, man-made disasters, and the development of the economic power of imperialist countries in China are all great driving forces, but the uneven distribution of land is also a very important element. Although China does not have the obvious phenomenon of concentrated land like Russia in the Tsarist era, in recent centuries, the trend of land merging from the hands of small farmers to rich farmers, and then from rich farmers to large landlords, has been a generally accepted fact by scholars studying rural economics. The concentration of land, no matter in which political system, will have a very bad impact, because the more concentrated the land, the more poor farmers will increase, the more poor farmers increase, the more farmers will leave the countryside, the more barren the farmland will be, resulting in social disorder and the decline of national agricultural production. (The concentration of land in socialist countries is an exception). Therefore, the core of Sun Yat-sen's theory of the Principle of People's Livelihood advocated in the Three Principles of the People is the equalization of land ownership. The so-called equalization of land ownership is to distribute the land evenly, so that farmers can have their own land. Before the implementation of the equalization of land ownership, the main land policy is to restrict the concentration of land. Now, this rural investment in the financial industry has the effect on agricultural land of being a vital force to promote the accelerated concentration of land. Because if the banking industry directly lends to farmers, of course, for the sake of stability, it will first lend to large landlords who own huge amounts of land. Then the function of the banking industry's investment is to improve the production of Chinese agriculture. The effect of this improvement is naturally to eliminate the farmers' internal labor force by mechanical ability, and the profits obtained from the increase in production become the capital for large landlords to annex small landlords' land. Thus, financial capital becomes the exploitation tool of large landlords after being dyed with agricultural capital. As for the direct operation of farmer mortgage or warehouse loans by banks, it is an investment in farmers below small farmers. According to this investment method, the financial capital that runs into the countryside will eventually directly operate agriculture, applying financial capital to agricultural productivity and gradually turning agricultural land from mortgage into a part of the capital of the financial industry. If cooperatives are used as an intermediary between banks and farmers, there is not much difference from the direct operation of banks, because banks can control the cooperatives they lead, and cooperatives can directly manage farmers. Although there is a separation of cooperatives between farmers and banks, the penetration of economic power is not prevented by intermediate institutions. For example, farmers send agricultural products to cooperatives as collateral and request loans. On the surface, the right to dispose of these mortgaged agricultural products belongs to the cooperatives. In fact, the funds of the cooperatives are the loans of the banking industry. Therefore, the final right to dispose of these mortgaged agricultural products naturally belongs to the banks. Therefore, after farmers' products flow into cooperatives, it is no different from depositing them in bank warehouses. According to the regulations of the cooperatives, these agricultural products used as collateral can be taken back by farmers with money, but in fact, the economic ability of general farmers is only maintained in a cycle of borrowing and lending. As a result, most farmers are unable to redeem the collateral. As a result, farmers also invisibly lose the profits that can be obtained from changes in commodity prices and the compensation that can be obtained from engaging in transportation with labor. Undoubtedly, this rural investment in the banking industry is to use scientific methods to overthrow the old-fashioned usurers, thereby taking their exploitative position. If this continues, the trend of agricultural land concentration under the activities of financial capital will be faster than the annexation of large landlords in the past.</p>
<p>Agriculture and land issues cannot be separated. Taking the United States as an example, the agricultural production methods in the United States apply modern scientific and technological techniques, but during the world economic panic, agricultural panic still occurred. At the same time, his panic was not due to poor seeds or backward production technology, because on the one hand, most farmers could not find bread to fill their hunger, and on the other hand, a large number of agricultural products were poured into the vast ocean. This is based on the uneven distribution of land. If we really want to save China's countryside, it is not by hoping that the term of investment in the countryside by the banking industry should be long, the interest rate should be low, there should be no competition, and by improving seeds and applying mechanical cultivation. At least the government should take the policy of restricting land concentration as a starting point, and implement emergency economic relief measures in a unified way, gradually moving from restoring the productive capacity of general farmers to improving production. In this way, perhaps we can overcome this difficult time of agricultural panic that concerns the life and death of China.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Systems of Agricultural Mortgages and Loans in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>Since the complementary development of modern industry and cities, rural land prices have been increasing daily. Land cultivation has transformed from fragmented plots to collective, large farms, and the means of production have shifted from rudimentary farm tools to sophisticated machinery. The use of land has evolved from extensive management with limited manual labor and fertilizers to intensive farming. All these changes require substantial capital, leaving farmers feeling financially constrained. Borrowing from private lenders entails high interest rates, unsuitable for the low-profit nature of agricultural operations. Seeking loans from banks is also difficult due to the long repayment periods typical of agricultural loans and the unsuitability of agricultural land as collateral (conventional banks are reluctant to accept land as collateral). Under these circumstances, farmers must either find their own solutions or rely on government assistance. The former involves credit cooperatives organized by farmers in various countries, while the latter includes farmer or land banks established by governments. Initially, these two entities operated independently. Cooperatives have close ties to farmers, but often lack sufficient capital during their establishment. Members, seeking loans, are often unable to deposit large sums for circulation, thus failing to solve the farmers' financial problems. Banks possess capital, but are too distant from farmers, finding it difficult to understand their individual and family circumstances, making loans difficult to obtain. Later, cooperation between the two parties emerged, with banks lending large sums to cooperatives, which then distributed the funds according to the needs of their members, thereby overcoming the aforementioned difficulties. Currently, cooperative systems of agricultural mortgages and loans in several European and American countries largely follow this principle. Some cooperatives themselves issue bonds to raise capital. Below is a detailed description of the key aspects of mortgage and loan cooperation systems in various European and American countries, for our reference.</p>
<p>Germany's agricultural credit system was established earliest and is considered the most complete today. Its land mortgage cooperative organization is the Land'Challen (Land Mortgage Cooperative). The earliest was the Silesian Mortgage Cooperative in 1769, followed by similar organizations in other regions. Until the end of the 19th century, these were collectively known as the old-style Land Mortgage Cooperatives. Initially, they were formed by large landowners who needed liquid capital, and membership was mandatory: all aristocrats owning land were required to join, regardless of whether they needed a loan. The bank's loans to its members were funded by its bond issuances. The bonds were secured by the value of the members' mortgaged land, so the amount issued could not exceed the amount loaned. Members seeking loans had to declare their collateral, which was then assessed by the bank before an appropriate amount of bonds was issued. Generally, the loan amount could not exceed 50% of the assessed value of the collateral. Members could then sell these bonds on the market to obtain cash. The interest on the bonds was typically 3% or 4%, depending on fluctuations in the financial market. In practice, the cooperative served only as an intermediary between the lender (i.e., the bond purchaser) and the borrower, assuming no responsibility for the repayment of the principal and interest. If the borrower defaulted, the bondholder could only claim directly from the debtor listed on the bond (i.e., by selling the mortgaged property). This system clearly had several shortcomings, the most significant being: (a) the cooperative did not have close ties with the lenders and borrowers, providing no guarantee for the borrower's repayment obligations, thus failing to fully embody the spirit of cooperation; (b) membership in the cooperative should not be mandatory; and (c) membership in the cooperative should not be limited to aristocrats, and small and medium landowners should also have the same opportunities.</p>
<p>After the 19th century, the cooperatives underwent reforms, abolishing class restrictions for membership and establishing special debt reduction funds. Thus, although the collateral for the bonds issued by the cooperative was still the entire mortgaged property, the principal was paid from the cooperative's debt reduction fund. In other words, the cooperative itself was responsible for repayment. The bonds and their attached interest coupons were bearer instruments, freely transferable or resalable. The amount of a loan to a member could reach two-thirds of the assessed value of the collateral, and had to be used for agricultural production. The maximum loan term was eighty years, with repayments made every six months. The total interest was added to the principal, and then the amount was evenly divided into installments.</p>
<p>Since the Land Mortgage Credit Cooperative was not for profit, it had no surplus to distribute to society, and all earnings were rolled into public debt funds. The cooperative's organization included a board of directors, responsible for issuing bonds and reviewing mortgages; a local bureau managing the funds of cooperatives within its region; and a general assembly, responsible for handling important principles and affairs of the cooperative. There was also a permanent committee, tasked with receiving business reports from the board of directors and auditing accounts.</p>
<p>Before the war, there were twenty-eight new and old-style cooperatives, with a total of 300 million marks in bonds issued by the cooperatives. With such rapid development, centralized control was essential. In 1873, the Central Land Mortgage Credit Cooperative was established in Berlin, with eight cooperatives joining. Its task was to assist the cooperatives in issuing bonds and to guarantee them. It also issued Central Land Bonds (Zentral-Pfandbrief) with the same lending conditions as the cooperatives.</p>
<p>Denmark has two land mortgage cooperative systems: the Credit Cooperative and the Mortgage Loan Cooperative, which are discussed separately below:</p>
<p>(a) Credit Cooperatives (Danlsh)(Kreditkassen): The first established was the Jutland Land Credit Cooperative (1851), followed by gradual increases, now totaling fourteen. Their source of funds is also the issuance of bonds, with bonds issued in batches, each batch worth US$1 million or several million dollars. The issuance period is two or three years. All borrowers receiving bonds from the same batch must be jointly liable. The collateral provided by members is limited to the first mortgage, and the loan amount cannot exceed 60% to 66% of the assessed value of the collateral. The term is fifty or sixty years, with repayment also made in installments. To understand the situation of the members and prevent losses, the cooperative sends people to various places to inquire about the economic situation of the members. Each district also has agents reporting to the cooperative. The government does not heavily restrict the cooperative, but can inspect the cooperative at any time. If it is deemed unsound, the government can take over management or dissolve it.</p>
<p>(b) Mortgage Associations: The purpose of this type of organization is to assist the aforementioned credit cooperatives in accepting second mortgages for lending. The lending procedures are the same as before, but because it involves second mortgages, the evaluation is extremely cautious. The loan amount cannot exceed 75% of the evaluation, and the term is twenty-five to thirty years. There are currently nine mortgage loan cooperatives. To avoid mutual competition and conflict, the Central Mortgage Bank of the Kingdom of Denmark was established in 1906 with a capital of 5,360,000 yuan. Its task is to purchase the bonds issued by the various cooperatives to stabilize their market prices.</p>
<p>The Dutch Land Mortgage Cooperative is affiliated with the Utrecht Central Bank and the Findhoven Mortgage Bank. The former was established in 1898, and its constituent units are local farmers' cooperatives and local credit institutions. In 1929, a total of 723 cooperatives joined. The bank's loans are limited to first mortgages, and as with the systems in other countries, it issues bonds. Members' loans must be introduced by the cooperative. The term is usually ten years, but can be as long as twenty years. At the same time, to facilitate long-term credit lending, a special cooperative bank was established with assets of 924,000 Florins, issuing bonds totaling 3,525,000 Florins, and lending 3,378,000 Florins.</p>
<p>The Findhoven Bank was established in 1896. In 1920, a total of 490 cooperatives joined. Loans do not require collateral if the amount does not exceed 50% of the assessed value of the mortgage. The loan term is forty years, and the interest rate for members' loans is slightly higher than the interest rate on the bonds, thus covering various administrative expenses.</p>
<p>The Belgian mortgage cooperative business is concentrated in The Louvain Central Bank. All situations are similar to those in the Netherlands, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>In Sweden, before 1770, the mortgage cooperative business was operated by the Bank of Sweden. In 1831, Mortgage Associations were organized. There are currently ten, each with a specific scope. Any local resident with net real estate assets of more than 1,125 yuan can become a member of the cooperative. The total value of the assets of all members of each cooperative cannot be less than 1,125,000 yuan. The interest rate for members' loans is typically 6%, plus handling fees, and must be repaid in installments. The source of funds for the cooperative is the issuance of bonds. Its circulation range reached Germany and France at its peak, but is now limited to the country. To prevent mutual competition among the bonds of the various cooperatives, the General Mortgage Bank of Sweden was established in 1861. All bonds are uniformly issued by the aforementioned agency, and the situation has since stabilized.</p>
<p>Since the 19th century in the United States, the value of mortgage loans has increased rapidly, indicating the urgent need for capital among farmers. In 1906, the US government passed the Federal Farm Loan Act. According to this law, a Federal Farm Loan Board and twelve Federal Land Banks were established. Each bank's capital was US$750,000, raised by the bank issuing shares of US$5 each. Under the banks, several National Farm Loan Agociation were established, formed by ten or more farmers. After their establishment, they can apply for loans from the bank. Members seeking loans must use land as collateral, and the purpose is limited to improving agricultural operations. The loan amount cannot exceed 50% of the assessed value of the collateral. The total loan amount of each cooperative must not be less than US$20,000. For every US$100 borrowed by a member, they must subscribe to one share of the Federal Land Bank. Subsequently, the cooperative's loans increased daily, and members' subscriptions to the bank's shares also increased accordingly. As a result, the government's investment was gradually repaid, and the shares of the Land Bank became wholly owned by the cooperatives.</p>
<p>Administratively, the cooperative has its own organization, which determines the conduct of its business; above the cooperative is the bank, and the bank is supervised by the loan office. The cooperative is responsible for evaluating the collateral for its members' loans, and usually collects interest and principal on behalf of the bank. If a member fails to repay the debt, the cooperative must be responsible for repayment.</p>
<p>After describing the mortgage cooperation systems of various countries, we cannot help but think of China's current problems. China certainly needs such an organization. In fact, the most common type of cooperative organization established in various places is the credit cooperative, but due to the lack of funds, very few can exist in a sound manner. In recent years, urban banks have also paid attention to rural investment and lending, which is certainly an optimistic phenomenon. However, to hope that this undertaking can develop properly, at least two things must be noted. First, future rural loans must be strictly limited to productive uses; second, China's current land survey and registration are not yet complete, which is also a major obstacle to the rural lending business using land as collateral. It is believed that at least if these problems are resolved, China's rural mortgage lending business can have full prospects for development.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bond Market Brewing Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, from February 25th to March 2nd, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a mostly sideways trend after settlement. Transactions gradually decreased, showing a calm and uneventful atmosphere. This was because various factors were brewing and had not yet been revealed. The financial support measures from various groups had not yet been implemented. The important meeting convened in Hankou had not yet produced results. The issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation was still in a state of cautious maneuvering, neither close nor distant. The rumor of a central government loan was just a rumor, with no clear signs of reality, making people both suspicious and credulous. The market sentiment remained uncertain. All these factors made investors hesitate, transactions decrease, and market prices stagnate. Last week, only Monday, being the last day before settlement, saw a slight squeeze on ordinary bonds, resulting in a slight increase of several jiao. However, the 23 Customs bond fell by 1.1 yuan. The 961 small triangular bond was suspended on Tuesday for the February futures settlement. The April futures auction on Wednesday was relatively lively, with prices increasing slightly by three to five jiao. The 23 Customs bond remained stable. On Thursday, the important meeting convened in Hankou slightly boosted market sentiment, resulting in a rebound in the afternoon and a return of several jiao. The 23 Customs bond rose by 7.5 jiao. The market was unusually dull on Friday and Saturday, with sideways trading and even fewer transactions. Throughout the week, except for Monday and Tuesday, most days saw sideways trading. Therefore, the resulting market prices, except for April, which was newly launched and incomparable, mostly saw slight increases of one or two to four jiao for March. The 19th Charity Bond, 22 Customs Bond, and 96 saw slight increases. The total turnover was 43.595 million yuan, plus 3,000 yuan in spot transactions. The results of the week's market prices are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Gold and Silver Advance Strongly</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 2nd) New York Stock Exchange, although the bulls took profits, the situation was still strong. The characteristic of today was the strong advance of gold and silver stocks, because the price of pure gold in London increased again, and silver prices in various places also surged. Noranda Mining and Dome Mining both saw new highs for the year. The Mount 株(MONT ) saw ……… because of buying from Britain. …….. Foreign exchange …. Some experts on Wall Street predict that the British exchange rate will fall to 4.21 yuan. Others continue to feel that the Ministry of Finance will soon increase the price of gold. Copper stocks are stable because the producers' meeting is scheduled to be held in New York next week, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be found for copper prices and production issues. The bond market and the small exchange market are quiet and uneven. Half-day turnover was 200,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>US Cotton Loosens, Closing Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening of US cotton saw a loosening market, with each month falling by four or five pounds per bale, because of poor news from Liverpool and foreign firms selling off. After the market price fell, peers engaged in buying, and a small number of shorts covered their positions, shifting the trend to stability. The closing was stable, with the spot price unchanged and futures falling by one to three pounds per bale. The British cotton market was strong and rising, with the spot price rising by five points and futures rising by five or six points. Indian cotton was strong due to buying by European exporters and speculators. The Pingguer and Bairoxi cotton rose by 2.25 rupees, and the Aomula cotton rose by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 2nd).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 4th was 247 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>

<p>River Rice Sales Stagnant, Both Wholesale and Retail Quiet</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs were very scarce, with only about ten or so shops (a total of about 2,000 shi of goods). The sales market was exceptionally sluggish, with most shops dropping prices to seek sales. The overall situation showed a declining trend, with little activity in both wholesale and retail. The price of Japonica rice eventually fell by fractions of a jiao. The evening rice market fell by one or two jiao. Yinbianyuan also saw a declining trend, with a drop of about two chi. Duyangjian had no market.</p>

<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>Red Rice, Black Melon Seeds, and Land Prices All Rise</p>
<p>Red Rice: Recently, both arrivals and inventories have been lacking, and the market has been very strong. Yesterday, according to a telegram from Shantou, the land price has risen by as much as three yuan due to the thin inventory. The cost of top-quality transparent red rice, including shipping costs, must be 38 or 39 yuan, which has become an unsustainable situation. A survey found that high-quality goods in Shanghai are scarce, with only about 200 pieces of medium-quality goods remaining, priced at around 30 yuan, with the hope of further increases.</p>
<p>Black Melon Seeds: The more abundant Xuzhou goods are said to be out of stock locally, and most have been concentrated in the Shanghai market. Therefore, those who previously purchased directly from Xuzhou have turned to the Shanghai market for procurement. The market has become tight as a result, and land prices are steadily rising, making it especially stable. Quotations have been offered from time to time in recent days. High-quality Xuzhou melon seeds are 9.2 or 9.25 yuan, and ordinary ones are 9 yuan. It is expected that the price will continue to rise. It is predicted that if the sales market is smooth, the price may reach the 10 yuan mark.</p>

<h3>On the Influence Received by Writers</h3>
<p>— He Jin</p>
<p>Every writer, in the process of writing, will inevitably be influenced by others to some extent, intentionally or unintentionally; such examples can be readily cited: In the sentence structure of Alexander Fadeyev, one can see many contours of Tolstoy; and the early works of the new American writer William Faulkner are almost entirely filled with the crisp, strange style of Gertrude Stein; in addition, there is Paul Morand's influence on Japanese writer Yokomitsu Riichi and American writer J. Heigeshimer; L. Kassil, the Soviet newcomer famous for writing "Uibandpanua," was indeed somewhat influenced by Mayakovsky; and finally, looking at the Irishman James Joyce, called a "giant of modern literature," how many people has he influenced in the last fifteen years?</p>
<p>This situation, called "influence," is originally a natural phenomenon in a writer's work process, and generally speaking, it is not surprising; but unfortunately, in our society today, the term "influenced" seems to be used too cleverly. Usually, if someone moves a "savage head" from overseas without any alteration, this situation is often called "influenced by such and such a master." In this case, in reality, the term "influence" has lost its original meaning and has become merely a "polite word" for "unconditional imitation."</p>
<p>And this, although only a linguistic embellishment and misunderstanding (or even an error), has a significant impact on the true development of writers. Often, after reading a little of someone's work, one may intentionally or unintentionally imitate it while writing. However, if the non-malicious imitation of unconsciously (or intentionally) writing like someone else due to familiarity with their work is also regarded as being "influenced" by someone, this statement can immediately trap the working writer in a dilemma; thus, Chinese Gorkys, Chinese Chekhovs... one after another, fabricated and immature "domestic products" emerge endlessly.</p>
<p>This is not beneficial to the development of the lauded writer himself.</p>
<p>However, if one is truly influenced by others, it is quite the opposite; not only does it not hinder the writer's development, but it can instead help him to open up his own world and create his own uniqueness. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, a writer's true being influenced by others, even if not necessarily essential, is at least an inevitable phenomenon in his creative process, although it is often not even consciously felt.</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to point out the difference between genuine "influence" and non-genuine "imitation."</p>
<p>In a lecture titled "My Creative Experience" at the publishing house of the Soviet Trade Union, Alexander Fadeyev said the following:</p>
<p>"If a writer is influenced by others to the point of accepting other writers' ideas and formal techniques, naturally, we call him an Epigonus (i.e., one who completely restates his teacher without creating any new theories). If an artist successfully raises new materials of the present, develops some new ideas, and is influenced by more experienced writers in the learning process, this is not surprising, because he can gradually break away from that influence in the process of development. Undoubtedly, each of us, whoever learns skills from classical writers, must critically study the ideological content of their works and the formal methods of artistic description." (Using the translation by Zhang Zhongshi in "Current Affairs Compilation" Vol. 3, No. 3)</p>
<p>This passage is very useful for us today; it not only points out the difference between influence and imitation (i.e., what is called Epigonus in the text), but also more meaningfully explains the precise method by which writers are "influenced" by others. "Critically studying the ideological content of others' works and the formal methods of artistic description"—this is the "secret" that every writer should know.</p>
<p>And finally, Fadeyev also pointed out that true influence, unlike imitation, which always turns the imitator into a clever "fake," can instead help the writer to create his own characteristics.</p>
<p>"He (the writer) can gradually break away from that influence in the process of development."</p>
<p>There are many examples illustrating this fact: many newcomers influenced by Joyce have developed along their own lines. In the works of Stein, Faulkner, and Hemingway, it is already impossible to find something as lengthy and obscure as "Ulysses"; and who can find the remains of "Resurrection" in "The Rout"?</p>
<p>Only this is truly what can be called "influenced"; and only by truly accepting influence can it be beneficial to the writer.</p>
<h3>On Landu Bula Road (Continued and Finished)</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>We also stopped the car. We saw that the fallen Indian had been injured: blood was flowing from his face and hands (cut by gravel and thorns!), and his mouth groaned: "Waist pain! Waist pain!" (because when he fell, the cargo and the cart were pressing heavily on his body.)</p>
<p>Several Bengalis opened their companion's mud-stained cargo, distributed his goods, and the other two held him in the middle, pushing three carts parallel to each other. —This injured person was helped up and forced to push the cart, enduring the pain.</p>
<p>"Brave Bengalis! How pitiful, toiling under the pressure of life!" I shouted in my heart.</p>
<p>The car that was holding us also drove away, and I was even more immersed in a tragic scene.</p>
<p>Was it five years ago? I went to Bagan to see a friend from elementary school who was sick. He was being eroded by hemoptysis, and his sunken eye sockets and faint voice proved that his life was coming to an end!</p>
<p>The history of this young friend can be written into a moving novel: after graduating from elementary school, he went to Nanyang (Southeast Asia) to make a living. At that time, it was the golden age of Nanyang. A relative who ran a cloth shop took care of him, having him carry some cloth from the shop every day and go deep into the coconut groves to peddle it to Malay and Chinese women. He also bent his back and shouldered heavy burdens, like a camel, gradually training from carrying hundreds of pounds of goods to being able to carry two or three hundred pounds. Thus, he accumulated a commission to go home to pay off debts and marry a wife. When he came to Nanyang for the second time, he encountered the misfortune of a recession. His relative's shop had already closed, and the goods purchased with cash had no sales. He carried the heavy cargo out early in the morning and returned with it again in the evening. The commission he earned was not enough to cover his own food expenses, and his wife at home had died of an epidemic! Unfortunately, one day, in the dim twilight, he inadvertently fell into a ditch, and his lungs were injured by the cargo. By the time people carried him back, the doctor announced that he was beyond saving.</p>
<p>He died that afternoon, leaving a pot full of blood in the spittoon, which also stained the bed sheets and the underwear on his body. At the time of his death, he was still tightly clutching the red woolen blanket, shouting with all his might:</p>
<p>"My cloth bundle! My cloth bundle!"</p>
<p>Due to the tragedy of the Bengalis, this tragic scene reappeared before my eyes. I heard my twenty-something young friend shout out the cry of human sorrow, and I also saw a large package pressing tightly on the shoulders of many poor people in this world, as if to trample these people like ants under huge feet.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes tightly. I dared not think anymore until the car "beeped" and the driver announced that we had arrived at Landu Bula, and I was awakened and hurriedly got out of the car.</p>
<h3>People and Books</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Liu Jingting</p>
<p>Thanks to Wu Weiye's "Biography of Liu Jingting," anyone who dabbles in ancient literature probably knows this famous storyteller. Wu Weiye indeed wrote this character vividly on paper, and Yunting Shanren used him to open the show in "The Peach Blossom Fan," believing that he was "a man of high character and unrestrained spirit, one of us, storytelling is just his extra skill." This storyteller is indeed not an ordinary person, and people often talk about him. Recently, I bought Wang Youding's "Sizhao Tang Collection" and saw two more records about him. One is "Liu Jingting wrote a portrait for Zuo Ningnan, and drew his own image beside it, knowing not to forget, and I praised him for it," with the line "The debater's tongue, the general's sword, when encountering white bones, they are dry and heroic," which can be said to be extremely complimentary to Liu. Wu's biography also mentions Liu's self-portrait, which shows that Jingting not only excelled at storytelling but also could paint. The second is "Four Excellences of Listening to Liu Jingting Telling History," the poem says:</p>
<p>A historian in a hundred years, relying on you to turn sorrow and joy to hurt the soul. No news of Gaozong's crossing south, only seeing the storyteller spreading it.</p>
<p>The events of breaking the enemy are no longer what they were back then, but the portrait of the soldier's power still exists. The bronze pillars of the Three Hans are often joked about, who remembers the general's old iron armor.</p>
<p>Entrusting life and death in a million-strong army, Sun Wu knows this and laughs at talking about war. Spending a thousand gold is commonplace, not exchanging it for the name in the market of Xuyi.</p>
<p>How can a hero's head bow to others, always treating the mountains and rivers as farce. A song about the Jingyang Hill incident, the running water in front of the door, the setting sun in the west (when telling a section of "Water Margin")</p>
<p>This poem certainly reflects the profound sorrow of Prince Yi as a remnant of the previous dynasty. But the moving power of Liu Jingting's storytelling, and that he was not telling stories for no reason, the books he told had their own purpose, is evident here. Yu Danxin's "Banjiao Miscellany" says that "Jingting used Tan Ci, when drunk, struck the table and sang sadly, captivating the audience, like a figure of You Meng and Dongfang Manqian," which is quite sufficient to describe him. It also says: "After Ningnan was defeated, he traveled to the army of Ma, the admiral of Songjiang, and was frustrated, already over eighty years old. Occasionally passing through my residence in Yisui Xuan, he still told the story of Qin Shubao seeing the maiden." This is the history after Wu's biography, which Wu's article did not mention. Zhang Zongzi's "Dream Recollections" is the most vivid and detailed record of the demeanor of storytelling, saying that "his depiction and portrayal are subtle to the finest detail, yet also concise and clean, not verbose, his voice is like a giant bell, when speaking of the crucial points, he shouts and yells, fiercely collapsing the house." And "speaking quietly, his speed, weight, swallowing, and inflection, entering the emotions, entering the muscles and bones, picking the ears of the world's storytellers and making them listen attentively, not fearing that they will bite their tongues and die," which has exhausted the spirit of Jingting's storytelling. In terms of political activities, Wu's biography is the most detailed. Because of proofreading the "Storytelling" article, thinking of "Liu Sheng," I took notes on it.</p>
<p>Debate on Jin Ping</p>
<p>Taking "Jin Ping Mei" as a realistic portrayal of social life of a generation is, generally speaking, a recent event. Therefore, the understanding of this book has changed over the past three hundred years. Recently, when engaging in the study of the history and literature of the period of the Reform Movement, I collected many newspapers and magazines of the time. In "New Novels," I unexpectedly encountered a progressive understanding of "Jin Ping Mei" thirty years ago. One was written by Pingzi, according to the preface, this person was a friend of Liang Qichao, perhaps the master of Pingdeng Ge. His article says: "In the book Jin Ping Mei, the author holds infinite grievances and infinite deep pain, and is in a dark era, with no one to talk to and no way to express it, and has no choice but to use novels to express it. It depicts the social conditions of the time, roughly one class. However, it is different from Water Margin, Water Margin is mostly written in a positive way, Jin Ping is mostly written in a side way; Water Margin is mostly written explicitly, Jin Ping is mostly written implicitly; Water Margin is mostly written in quick words, Jin Ping is mostly written in painful words; Water Margin is clear and cheerful, Jin Ping is hidden and sad; Water Margin holds strange anger, Jin Ping holds strange grievances; the circumstances are different, and the writing is also different. Moreover, the short letters and small songs in it are often outstandingly elegant, surpassing what Song Ci and Yuan Qu can achieve. It can also show the situation of petty people and women at that time, and the degree of people's thinking. It is truly a social novel, and should not be regarded as a pornographic book." Although this view still inevitably has the shortcomings of subjective imagination, its ability to read novels from a social perspective can be said to be the most progressive understanding, looking back thirty years. The second was written by Manshu, who discussed the two books "Jin Ping" and "The Gallant Maid." He said of "Jin Ping" that: "In my opinion, the best chapter titles in novels are in Jin Ping Mei. The reputation of Jin Ping Mei should not be lower than that of Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber. This is what novel commentators have called the ancestor of pornographic books. I used to read it, and even after reading several volumes, I still felt no interest. Later, I changed my method and regarded it as a kind of social book to read, and then I realized that there must be something true under the fame. Whoever reads pornographic books, none do not concentrate all their energy on the places where pornography is written, and otherwise, they read casually and do not pay much attention. This is probably the common nature of readers. As for Jin Ping Mei, I certainly cannot say that it is not a pornographic book, but its mystery is definitely not in the writing of pornography, because this book is a book that depicts the lower-class women's society. Commentators say that Dream of the Red Chamber is completely taken from Jin Ping Mei, and is said to be an inverted image of Jin Ping Mei, which should be true. If its chapter titles and inscriptions are truly excellent." Although his views are not as good as Pingzi's, he can indeed make a further observation on Jin Ping. This Manshu is also a friend of Yin Bing, I wonder if it is Su Manshu? I hope that Manshu's friends can verify this.</p>
<h3>Moving House</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>When Ya Ru and I came to Shanghai, we lived in one room, and we always felt that there were too few things and that we lacked utensils. Moreover, living together, we gradually felt a bit bland. At that time, I thought: I should slowly make some odd items, such as a writing desk, rattan chairs, a kettle, tea sets, a vase, a trunk, etc., partly for my own use, and partly to decorate the room a little. If people say that life is bland, I might as well bring my mother out to add an old person, which will definitely eliminate some of the dryness in life.</p>
<p>At that time, we lived on Rue du Père Robert. In three months, we had to move because the original house was too dilapidated, and the newly rented house was both new and cheap. The new address was Route Frelaut. At that time, because there were few things, a total of three rickshaws, including the people, were enough to move everything.</p>
<p>After that, we moved from Route Frelaut to Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Haig, and after several moves, we still did not feel much difficulty in moving because our things had not increased much. However, time slowly passed, and Ya Ru and I had been living together for two years. In addition to the two of us, there was actually a child; it was no longer the bland state of life before. A little person, noisy all day long. At the same time, there were also many more daily necessities: beds, tables, chairs, desks, boxes, cradles, and some odd items, two or three times more than before. However, living in habit every day, I had not noticed these extra items until recently when we had to move again, and the problem also arose.</p>
<p>In advance, I discussed with Ya Ru the method of hiring a car. At least eight or nine rickshaws were needed, and to Xujiahui, each car would cost at least thirty cents, plus the tip, three dollars would be reliable, which was not worthwhile. Hiring a small car, about three would be enough, but the price of a small car was high, each would cost ninety cents to one dollar, and people had to follow, which was not worthwhile. What to do? Now we really hate that we have too many things. Moreover, Ya Ru actually said:</p>
<p>"Usually, I told you to buy fewer utensils, but you wouldn't listen. What's the matter? Now you know it's troublesome, right?"</p>
<p>What she said was actually wrong. The wrong thing was that she shouldn't have put the responsibility for having too many things on me. Honestly, some of the things were what she told me to buy. What should I say to her? Argue? It was useless, and even her complaint was of no help.</p>
<p>"What's the point of saying these things? Just think of a way to move," I finally replied to her. At the same time, I seemed to think that I shouldn't be scolded for nothing, and then said, "But when moving, didn't you often say that there were too few things to use?"</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to hire a moving truck because since such a truck could move both people and things, wouldn't it be very fast to go?</p>
<p>"How annoying, moving house, what a troublesome thing."</p>
<p>Ya Ru was complaining while packing things. The child was also making a fuss, making it so that you could not only not do more things, but also messed up your mood.</p>
<p>"How could I not know that moving house is troublesome?"</p>
<p>I said, continuing to pack things. A cloud of dust rose in the room, and some torn paper, broken shoes, and ink bottles lay messily on the floor.</p>
<p>Why don't we move? Why should we be afraid of trouble? Thirteen dollars a month for rent, the amount is not small. Now that we move to Xujiahui, the subtenant there is an old friend of many years, the rent is less, and when we are short of money, we can still owe it. Where can we find such a convenient thing?</p>
<p>"Isn't it that after moving, we will have some advantages, convenient places?" I stopped and said to Ya Ru, "How come, have you forgotten what I said to you?"</p>
<p>That day, we finally moved both people and things over. We hope that the words "moving house" will not reappear in our lives.</p>
<h3>Toward Evening (12)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The drinking and eating began. Among the four people, except for the author of National Literature Spectacle, who, holding his smoking paraphernalia, refrained from drinking a drop due to harming the national economy, the three people were almost swigging from jars and urns. They were all together. They drank one cup after another, and they talked even more about one thing after another. When they talked about something they agreed on, the uncle and nephew would nod their heads in unison:</p>
<p>"No need to say, no need to say." The nephew shook his head and sighed, but still seemed somewhat calm. "I've said it before. What comes in from the counter is still more than what goes out from the drawer. There are more beggars at the door than buyers. Expenses are inevitable, and the scene must be set. Upward! Ha, upward. Those who do business can't blame the upward trend. But I don't blame myself either. It's interesting to talk about it. From the time Dad died until now, the money wasn't all spent by me. It's fate. If you say I don't know how to do business, I can still read the wind and steer the rudder. But for six or seven years, it's always—always—always the same, a 'sigh' character. Only that year, the year when Ning and Han split the family, did I have a stroke of luck. Old, outdated things were also sold as new trendy goods. Something worth a dime would sell for two dollars, or even more than ten dollars—that year was, was—um, what about the second year? Um! No need to say, no need to say, come on! Have another drink? Have another drink!"</p>
<p>"Can I still drink?" Black Eyebrows straightened up. The cucumber face split open another crack. The cups were raised in unison, "Then you—sigh! You, Mr. Li! Come on! Let's have another drink!"</p>
<p>Drinking sullenly, without speaking. Li An was already a bit tipsy. But he also accepted a big cup with a smile.</p>
<p>"Good! Happy! Happy! I'll come to your wedding feast in the future!" Hu Yiyuan looked at Li An's demeanor, raised his cup and touched Li An's cup, and said, "Poor little fellow, he hasn't even hung a name in the Women's Army yet, let alone been a small soldier?"</p>

<h3>International Anti-War Strike Movement</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>A dispatch from New York states: 100,000 American university students who believe in "freedom" are showing signs of a strike movement to oppose the tendency of nationalism and the militarist attitude in some aspects within the country, due to the existence of "various forces in the United States that are currently forcing the country into war and pan-aggressive tendencies." Furthermore, similar student movements are also taking place in countries such as Canada, Cuba, Argentina, and Chile. Students from other countries who approve of the student anti-war conference plan are all invited to participate in this international strike movement.</p>
<p>Of course, to a certain extent, this movement takes the anti-nationalism and pan-aggressive tendencies it proclaims as its goal. After Hitler and Mussolini are declaring that all students nationwide must receive military training, this cannot but be said to be an event where "public reason resides in people's hearts." This is like how, after the outbreak of the European War, the student circles in Beijing rose up to oppose participation in the war, at least it can make some people who have been drinking Yangzhou rice soup of "patriotism" from the powers that be, and who have inexplicably walked into war, awaken.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of war, everyone now knows that it is to sacrifice the majority of people for the benefit of a small number, and if people recognize this reality, it will be difficult to maintain this deception. Obviously, this deception has learned a historical lesson in the European War. On the one hand, bones were exposed in the battlefield, creating many orphans and widows, and on the other hand, entertainment and revelry were rampant, not to mention that the glory and "justice" of the motherland that was fought for were only a continuation of the exploitation of slaves. The anti-war movement that has been growing since the end of the European War is due to the exposure of this deception.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how loudly Hitler shouts about restoring the Third Reich, and how highly Mussolini's sermons about the glory of the Roman Empire are sung, the general public, looking back on the past, still cannot erase the traces of their blood-stained wounds. But they are nationally unified and claim to be prosperous, why are they able to do this? "Pan-isms." Pan-isms can be said to be the Italian army going to Africa to conquer colonies, and pan-isms can also make the people of Saar declare the victory of the "nation" under the coercion of the "German front." Especially in the present time of tight war crisis, pan-isms have almost become a popular weapon of preparedness in various countries.</p>
<p>But this kind of "militarist attitude" of pan-isms can temporarily push humanity towards war, and at the same time, it can also push them towards opposing war. The rise of the international anti-war strike movement is a sign that students who believe in "freedom" have realized that war will not only not benefit them, but will also be extremely harmful. It is very clear: if you want to "love your country," this patriotism is not for the majority of the people, but for yourself. We certainly cannot hope that this strike movement will cause many "militarist attitudes" that are eager to gain victory in war to change, but to be able to make them change, only some people who are facing each other in the trenches because of "patriotism" must feel that their enemies are not these "soldiers," but others.</p>
<p>The anti-war strike movement should have this enlightenment for people.</p>
<h3>Song of the Condemned</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>(Bare tree branches and small grasses begin to reveal hints of tender green amidst the brown and black, and wild sparrows are also busily planning new days in the sun. People can hardly fail to notice: another spring has arrived!</p>
<p>Warm air currents, warm breezes, intertwine to weave a series of strikingly discordant, almost unbearable days; good scenery and bad moods stubbornly confront each other in my heart, and I am as disoriented as a kite caught in a whirlwind.</p>
<p>——Oh, this endless chain of days!</p>
<p>However, now it is: this chain is pulling the green spring along with it.)</p>
<p>A strange hot wind blew in through the window,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>and my heart involuntarily trembled; then I jumped up in surprise: it is another new, unfamiliar spring!</p>
<p>I glanced at my reflection in the large mirror: all the signs of a life devoid of joy were fully present, the graying stars in my temples, the hard lines of life on my face, and the dimness in my eyes, devoid of spirit.</p>
<p>I felt the chain of days like a giant African python, tightening its coils around my entire life day by day; I was bound like a condemned prisoner before the guillotine.</p>
<p>What I felt was heavy suffocation: the shackles of days are terrifying, the shackles of days are stubborn.</p>
<p>So, desolately accompanying the trembling six-stringed zither, I began to sing softly: "Before the small grass of spring, I am a condemned man in a chain gang…"</p>
<p>The sound, like a wavering ripple in the blue water, drifted leisurely into the fields outside the window; in the zither's coda, clouds drifted slowly in the sky: one piece, two pieces…</p>
<p>Countless youthful days were all transformed in the unfamiliar cloud mountains of foreign lands, teaching me the ways of a condemned man with precious treasures from many books, and the vitality of stubborn youth: so in the inevitable conflict between generations, braving the white-hot flames, I drifted away, leaving the sighs of the elderly behind without emotion.</p>
<p>Some magnificent spectacles were arranged head-on in the world ahead: terror, humiliation, hunger, and instability, like snowflakes in the north wind, followed endless days, pelting towards me like beads.</p>
<p>I also drew courage and comfort from my own and others' worlds; the hardships of life are not worth worrying about, they are the forging and testing of young people, valuable night lights on the long journey of life.</p>
<p>Firmly remembering these precious words, I silently bore the heavy burden of the world, walking past with rough steps like a camel.</p>
<p>It was as if every day I was playing hide-and-seek with those future days while dragging heavy shackles, I hid, I escaped, and so the days flowed by like water. Every spring, when a new group of days began, I inevitably felt a burst of heat, a burst of anxiety. In the end, the beautiful spark of hope withered along with the youthful light in my eyes, and I grew old in the sorrows of life, and then I began to understand: "I am a condemned man in a chain gang."</p>
<p>So, I lived on so calmly: the condemned man has his certain way of life, there is no way to relieve the tribulations of life.</p>
<p>And now it is: the black hair is also dotted with white stars in the desolate large mirror; knowing that it is not clever to envy the green in the pile of withered grass; so when the oriole sings proudly on the branch opposite the window, I cannot concede and put the noise of the condemned man into the trembling of the six-stringed zither:</p>
<p>"Before the small grass of spring, I am a condemned man in a chain gang."</p>
<h3>Decline</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>The owner of Yuan Kee Store, Second Master, sat at a south-facing desk, flipping through the ledger page by page with his left hand; his right hand snapped and crackled as he worked the abacus beads. He carefully watched the numbers on the abacus, but his face was covered with a layer of frost-like melancholy. His two hands trembled slightly, and a pair of lifeless eyes peered out from under his old copper-framed glasses, casting glances of annoyance towards the street in front of the store. But the street was cold and deserted, almost like you could catch ghosts there. He moved his gaze to the counter, and immediately saw the apprentice, Ah Cai, dozing off on it.</p>
<p>"Ah Cai, didn't you get enough sleep last night? Dozing off in broad daylight, no wonder all the business has been driven away!" He seemed to think that the store's poor business was entirely due to Ah Cai's dozing off, so he had to vent his anger on him. Ah Cai, scolded by him, hurriedly rubbed his dark hands over his eyes, drawing a blurry gray circle around them, and trembled like a small mouse into the corner of the counter.</p>
<p>"Sigh! It's really hard to do business these days. The accounts for the upstream suppliers can't be shorted by half a cent, not even for a moment, but the retail business is so slow, and only 30% of the accounts owed by the villages are being collected. The store is out of goods, but where has the money gone? What kind of store is it if you open the door and have nothing to sell? And there's no money to replenish the goods! Moreover, the suppliers have declared that they only deal in cash this year. If you don't offer credit, no business comes to the door, but if you offer it, you can't get the money back. It's really hard, hard!" As soon as he thought of "hard," it seemed as if countless "hard" characters appeared in his mind; even as if his surroundings were all "hard" characters. He saw "hard" characters everywhere on the abacus and in the ledger! He was a little frightened, and suddenly threw the "General Clearance" ledger of Yuan Kee Store angrily on the ground, and with a crackling sound, he messed up all the numbers that had been calculated on the abacus; patting his head, he took a cold breath, stood up abruptly, then stepped down from behind the desk, glancing angrily towards the door, muttering to himself:</p>
<p>"Damn it, I don't want to run this lousy store anymore!"</p>
<p>He picked up a water pipe, and Ah Cai hurriedly and carefully put a lit paper on it. While he smoked, he was pondering the question of closing or keeping the store open. He thought that in the first year that Yuan Kee Store was opened, after deducting all expenses, there was still a surplus of more than four hundred dollars at the end of the year. In the second year, his wife had a serious illness, and then she died; so the store was basically working for nothing, with no extra money. Last year, the third year, was even worse, with losses, expenses, consumption, and debts, and now the store's total inventory is less than two hundred dollars. Moreover, last year, in order to repay the debt to the rice store, he borrowed fifty dollars from Jin Sheng, with a monthly interest of five silver dollars. He had originally planned to repay him after the market opened on the fifth day of the new year, but nearly a month has passed, and there is less than twenty dollars in business, and the store's goods must be replenished, what to do! Thinking of this, his mind became even more confused, he simply could not think any further. He put the water pipe down in his hand, already stopping smoking.</p>
<p>"Close it down!" After being stunned for a long time, he discussed with himself: "No, if I close the door, it will be even more difficult to collect the rural debts, and they will have an even better excuse to delay. But if I don't close it, I'll just have to watch it lose money; there's no business, I don't dare to offer credit, there's no money to replenish the goods, sigh!" This problem was really difficult to solve; he couldn't close it, and he couldn't keep it open, and no one wanted to take it over. Thinking about it again and again, it was still like tangled hemp, making his heart ache. Finally, he simply put the water pipe on the desk and stopped smoking.</p>
<p>He sat on a sugar jar lid, hugged his knees with both hands, and stared blankly outside the door. In those two hours, not a single customer came to the counter. Although a few people walked past the door, in his eyes, they were all annoying faces and blurry shadows, and the street was completely silent.</p>
<p>"Hard!" So again, countless "hard" characters swirled in his mind!</p>
<h3>Father</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Spring brings the gentle breeze of February:</p>
<p>In the lonely small building in the thick fog—as if in a monastery, the alarm clock rang at six o'clock, and the father, whose hair was mottled with mental illness, sat up in bed, stretching his stiffening limbs. This slight tremor awakened his son from his beautiful dream, a tall young man with a pair of arms like a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>"Dad, don't always pay attention to those flowers, it's not even light yet."</p>
<p>"Yes. —Today is the tenth anniversary of your mother's death, I want to go to the cemetery."</p>
<p>Dad spoke with a heavy, slurred tongue. From his prematurely aged face, the majesty of a forty-five-year-old man could no longer be found. He got out of bed slowly, put on his morning coat, and went to the clothes tree covered with a faded embroidered sheet, pulling out a set of outdated, slightly worn Western clothes, carefully dressing himself like a groom going to church to get married, and finally had his son button on a colorful tie, then walked alone into the courtyard.</p>
<p>The son quickly finished getting ready, took a brocade purse and a rattan cane from beside his father's pillow. He jumped to the stone steps in the courtyard, where his father was holding the potted flowers under the eaves of the railing and taking them to the wall that was shone by the sun every day.</p>
<p>"Dad, let me help you move them"!</p>
<p>Usually Dad would shake his head and say, "No! No! I've moved them for many years and never broken a pot"! He would tremble like that, carrying the potted flowers back and forth, and would get very angry if his son didn't listen to him. —Today he didn't answer, looking up at the sky: the thick fog was gradually dissipating, and the sunlight hidden in it was dazzling his eyes, or perhaps he was particularly excited, he also felt a little uncomfortable, coughed, and sat down on the stone steps. The son then lifted up two of them with both hands.</p>
<p>"Be careful, don't break them! Your mother cherished these few pots of flowers the most"!</p>
<p>His voice was as gentle as motherly love.</p>
<p>As they opened the small gate of the courtyard, the ringing of a milk delivery bicycle faded away on the stone path. Dad held a bouquet of flowers in one hand, supported himself with the rattan cane, and walked forward with quick steps, his son following closely behind him, not daring to support him.</p>
<p>The sound of two mismatched leather shoes echoed on the stone path, like grand music in the clear morning breeze, two leaping hearts, the colorful tie fluttering on Dad's shoulder.</p>
<p>The keeper of the cemetery was a sharp-eyed old man, who stopped sweeping with his long-handled broom and said:</p>
<p>"I knew the old gentleman would be coming today."</p>
<p>"We've both grown a year older, but you're still so healthy." As if he were a young man, he patted the old man's shoulder, but felt as if his own leg strength was not enough and took two steps back.</p>
<p>"Hehe," he laughed unnaturally, "a distant ten years!"</p>
<p>Almost mumbling, they walked toward the tomb path, again so quickly.</p>
<p>The son was a head taller than him; standing side by side in front of the tombstone of "Deceased Wife ×××," his head sank to his chest, and he</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>prayed in his heart: "Ten years, I have cherished those flowers you loved as if loving a young girl! Do you see your son, he has also reached the age for his father to marry"?</p>
<p>He felt that he had handed over a heavy responsibility. He straightened his colorful tie, which had been blown up, and gazed at the tiny flowers nodding to him in the gentle breeze of February.</p>
<h3>Clouds and Sky Leaving Hometown</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>"Since parting, I recall our meeting, how many times have our souls dreamed together. Tonight I still hold the silver lamp to illuminate, I still fear that our meeting is but a dream!"</p>
<p>On the way back and forth through life, in the autumn of a foreign land; I long for the clouds and sky of my hometown. In the season of yellow flowers, the southern gentle breeze blew her to the bustling Shanghai. A three-day stay, immersed in ancient dreams. Hastily, we are again on the road back to our hometown.</p>
<p>But alas, like a midnight dream! These old traces have again turned into bubbles! Facing the long sky of the city, I long for the clouds and sky of my hometown. Seeing the faded spring light, my heart is like a solitary goose leaving the flock! A pang of bitterness fills my heart.</p>
<p>Recalling the old outlines, only confusion! The water in the big Jia River carries a joyful heart, and also carries a sorrowful body. Once or twice a year, her pain intensifies. My hometown is also decaying year by year along with the ancient city walls! Like a kite with a broken string, without boundaries. Like a spotted eagle with an arrow, reflecting bloodstains.</p>
<p>In the south-facing window, the faint sunlight of autumn is reflected. In a joyful atmosphere, I read every magazine brought from Shanghai. In the neat drawer, I select a note card and send it to a friend under the red lanterns. Praising my hometown, it is always like being in the embrace of the spring breeze. The pastoral interests attract my dissolute heart. Closing the book and pondering, her face is a manifestation of optimism.</p>
<p>In the backyard, goldfish swim in the calm water. Sticking together in pairs, like mandarin ducks side by side. The chrysanthemums in the flower bed unfold their mature, tender yellow. A gust of hollow autumn wind causes the old banyan tree to rustle. Burning a cigarette, I meditate in the shadow of the setting sun.</p>
<p>This painting of my hometown's outline is fading away with the passing of time! Longing for the clouds and sky of my hometown, infinite sorrow attacks my body and mind.</p>

<p>Zheng Bo's Conquest of Duan at Yan (Continued)</p>
<p>Duke Zhuang's intention was that if he treated him urgently, then his evil would not be apparent, and the people's hearts would not be convinced; if he treated him leniently, then his evil would be exposed, and the people would have no excuse. The reason why he did not question him at the beginning was to increase Duan's crimes and kill him. Little did he know that Duan's continuous evils grew day by day, and Duke Zhuang's evils grew with him. Duan's crimes became deeper and deeper, and Duke Zhuang's crimes became deeper and deeper. People only saw that Duke Zhuang wanted to kill one Duan, but I alone thought that after the enfeoffment of Jing and before the attack on Yan, his intentions had never forgotten Duan for a moment. If he conceived one thought, it was killing one brother; if he conceived a hundred thoughts, it was killing a hundred brothers. Duke Zhuang's crime was not greater than Duan's. I have repeatedly examined it, and then I knew that Duke Zhuang's heart was the most dangerous in the world. The followers of Ji Zhong did not recognize his motives and instead advised him that his capital city exceeded the regulations. They did not know that Duke Zhuang wanted it to exceed the regulations. They advised him that he would gain the support of the masses with his generous treatment. They did not know that Duke Zhuang wanted him to gain the support of the masses. All the ministers and grandees in the court were trapped in his scheme. The poets of Zheng did not recognize his motives and instead criticized him for not being able to overcome his mother and using her to harm his brother. They did not know that Duke Zhuang wanted to use the name of not being able to overcome his mother to attack his brother. He was intolerant of small things, leading to great chaos. They did not know that Duke Zhuang wanted to use the name of acting intolerantly to mislead all the people in the country.</p>

The censorate and provincial government offices stand alongside singing and dancing pavilions. You can hear the bell of Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou city. Its midnight sound reaches the passenger boats. See how the red cliffs and crimson maples are dyed scarlet. By the Wu King's Terrace, one feels a sense of timelessness. White clouds remain a common sight. Only reeds remain along the flowing waters. The rise and fall of singing and dancing are things of the past. Emperor Qianlong traveled alone through the Jianghan region, leaving his mark. He loved the scenery of Suzhou the most, with its refined simplicity and vibrant beauty. Several times he sought Chen Gelao in the south, and Suzhou was sure to be revisited. Truly, Suzhou is a place one never tires of seeing. Tiger Hill is praised as the best of scenic spots. There are famous mountains and flowing green waters. One can inquire and explore in detail. There are delightful social gatherings and famous courtesans in brothels. The adorned beauties number three hundred, echoing the eternal romance of Eastern Qi. Delight in seeing the waters by Baodai Bridge, lively, green, and free-flowing. The lights shine in the sky, creating a daylight scene. Guanzheng Street is crowded with people. Back then, it was not inferior to the mirage city of Shanghai. It even surpassed it in many ways. Don't you see how many princes and wealthy young men come to Suzhou with tens of thousands of strings of cash? It's all because Emperor Qianlong visited Jiangnan three times, leaving historical sites in Suzhou. Therefore, it has been a provincial capital since ancient times. The censorate is established in Suzhou. Endless scenery to talk about leisurely.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (7)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(7) The Beginning of Hollywood's Founding</p>
<p>Today, whenever anyone mentions the word "Hollywood," they almost certainly mean "cinema." Hollywood and cinema have become almost inseparable. But strangely, the films we've discussed so far all happened before cinema moved to Hollywood. Now we'll talk about the origins of Hollywood.</p>
<p>The invention of Hollywood, like the invention of cinema, was an accident. In 1913, when the film industry was just beginning to flourish, major film companies and figures in the film industry were concentrated or scattered in cities such as New York, Shika Valley, Wakelan, and Philadelphia. There were also a few small film companies in Los Angeles, but in that small village called Hollywood, people rarely saw a camera, unless filmmakers from Los Angeles occasionally went there to shoot outdoor scenes.</p>
<p>"Holly" is originally a thorny shrub with uneven, prickly leaves. In winter, its leaves remain evergreen and glossy, and small red berries grow in the middle of the leaves, like the red berries of Nandina domestica. It is used to make Christmas wreaths. Hollywood was named because of the holly groves that grew there. At that time, Hollywood was just a real estate name, but those who discovered that Hollywood could be used as a residential area have now become millionaires.</p>
<p>Among those people, one who was directly related to the invention of Hollywood was Robert Brunton. Brunton was a Scotsman who worked as a set designer, painter, and carpenter in a film company. He came to America with the famous British actor, Sir Henry Irving. But later he became interested in film and did not return with him. However, he soon became unemployed because he had a bad temper and lived day to day without a plan. One day he went out for a walk and reached the current Sunset Boulevard. He stopped. He saw a large area of wasteland with only a few shack-like houses. He remembered reading in the newspaper that a newly established film company was moving to Los Angeles but had not yet found a suitable location.</p>
<p>Can you guess who those founders of the new company were? They were Jesse Lasky, who was half-poor and half-rich, Samuel Goldfish ("Goldfish," who later changed his name to Samuel Goldwyn), and Arthur Friend, a poor lawyer. These people pooled their limited funds to start a film company and hired a down-on-his-luck writer named Cecil B. DeMille as their director and stage manager. At that time, Dustin Farnum was just beginning to gain some small fame on the stage. They hired him to make a film.</p>
<p>Brunton thought of this and immediately ran to the Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles to see Goldwyn. People at that time spoke less and did more. Brunton met Goldwyn and started by saying, "I've found you the best possible location." Goldwyn was also not one for much talk. He simply asked, "Is the land expensive?" That's how Hollywood was created.</p>
<p>The price of that wasteland and a few wooden houses was very limited—only a few hundred dollars per acre—and the deal was closed in a few weeks. The new company was called Lasky Studio. This company later created countless stars, such as Wallace Reid, Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels, Dorothy Dalton, and so on, but those are just a few of the most famous. But at the time, when the founders started working in a few wooden houses, how could they have foreseen the greatness of their future endeavors?</p>
<p>The success of the Lasky Company gradually attracted the attention of film figures from other places, and everyone began to move to Hollywood. Hollywood's ability to become the film capital of the world also had to do with favorable timing and location. The climate in Southern California is mild and spring-like all year round. Sunlight, the only thing needed at that time because they rarely used lights and relied on sunlight to shoot films, was particularly bright in Hollywood, with very little rain throughout the year. In terms of location, the price of land in Hollywood was very cheap. The price of one acre of land in New York could buy dozens of acres in Hollywood. There were many wooden houses there, and the price of wood was very low, making the cost of building studios very small. Labor costs were only half of what they were in New York. With so many advantages, Hollywood's future development was a natural fit. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "King of the Ritz"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>King of the Ritz — Carlton</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen few British films. The "King of the Ritz," which is now showing at the Carlton, appears in the form of a satirical comedy.</p>
<p>It doesn't lose its comedic effect. Its style, like many British comedies, is never too frivolous, like American slapstick films. Instead, it maintains the consistent solemnity of the British, carrying a strong sense of gentlemanliness, as people generally say, even in scenes that are meant to be funny. This aspect should be unique to British films. However, perhaps because of this reason, British films are not enthusiastically welcomed by people who are used to watching American films, although this does not negate their value in cinematic art.</p>
<p>"King of the Ritz" is not without value, at least the screenwriter's attempt; not teaching the little clerk leader of the hotel to climb up, let him awaken the spring dream of wealth, still return to the original place, still combine with the same status of the maid, is still more desirable. Similarly, the screenwriter makes the kings go back sadly, the vain rich widow also finally combines with the golf player, each returns to its original position, and walks out of the door of the magnificent hotel. But the screenwriter did not succeed in the main reality, at least not in the great achievement in technology.</p>
<p>Perhaps people see the emperor with many medals in his pocket, and he can confer them on people at any time as he pleases. Perhaps people find the ugliness of that group of luxurious men and women, such as the dance teacher, such as the golfer athlete, such as the flirtatious widow, such as the emperor's entourage, etc., very interesting as satire, but this includes a lot of unrealistic expressions. The most obvious is that the hotel waiter happens to be the Marquis, and the various things of the male protagonist in the Marquis's mansion are unbelievable, although these places can fully make people laugh.</p>
<p>Because Stanley Luoino's acting is very good, in the last scene of the Marquis's official residence, the drunken singing is very emotional, and this tragic part of the comedy does have some value. Like the female lead's licentiousness and vanity, and the king's flirting, the time the three men visit the widow at the same time, is also an excellent skill</p>
<p>However, in general, the lack of success in this film is that it is not technically enough to express the theme, so that it has always become a mediocre comedy.</p>
<h3>Abfuess Schalomoff's New Work "Incense Seal Illusion" to be Performed</h3>
<p>Russian composer Abfuess Schalomoff has resided in Tianjin and Beijing for over a decade, devoting himself to the study of Chinese music and drama and seeking ways to improve Chinese music and drama. Schalomoff believes that Chinese music has a wealth of melodies, and if composers extract its essence and use methods such as harmony and counterpoint to create symphonic works, then Chinese music can also stand out in the world of music and rival the advanced countries of the West. Schalomoff advocates starting with music to reform Chinese drama, as Chinese drama is similar to Western opera and must have special music suitable for the plot in order to avoid the disease of repetition. Schalomoff wanted to realize his dream, so he composed an opera performed in the United States, which was well received by the people there. His symphony and pantomime "The Heart of the Piano in Rippling Light" was performed in Shanghai the year before last, and critics called it the harbinger of improved Chinese drama. Schalomoff has recently composed a pantomime called "Incense Seal Illusion," which is divided into three acts. The plot is bizarre, the music is beautiful, and the performers are all Chinese actors with rich experience and well-known reputations. It is directed by Xu Jichuan and Yang Yulou, and is now fully rehearsed. It is scheduled to be performed at the Carlton Theatre starting on the 13th of this month, for three consecutive days. The scenery of the play was painted by Dong Lachiff, a professor at the Hangzhou National Academy of Art. The music is performed by the entire Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra, conducted by Mei Baiqi. Those who wish to listen to elegant music and use Schalomoff's work as a reference for studying and improving Chinese drama should not miss this opportunity. Seats can be reserved at Robinson Piano Shop, 78 Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>Schoolgirl's Loving Mother (Grand Old Girl) (8)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Dade hurriedly pretended to be indifferent and replied, "It's nothing." He folded the newspaper and stuffed it behind his back, saying repeatedly, "It's nothing." Miss Beales, like a teacher scolding a cheating student, stretched out her hand and said, "Give it to me!" Dade reluctantly handed over the newspaper and said, "Miss Beales, now is not the time to read the newspaper. Why don't you wait until..." But Miss Beales had already seen that piece of news... She was suspended from the Education Bureau... but not under the name of suspension, but under the name of long-term leave... and her successor had already been appointed. She was stunned when she saw it. Her lips trembled, but she couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>Dade carefully looked at her face and said, "Miss Beales, go inside and sit down." Beales still forced a smile and said, "No, Clarence. I'm fine." Dade comforted her and said, "Long-term leave... can't you still do something?" Beales said, "I don't know how to do anything." Dade suddenly became afraid for her. He stared at her and asked, "Miss Beales, have they arranged anything for you... I'm talking about money? Don't you have a pension?" Miss Beales looked ahead and sighed, "I have to work for forty years to get a pension. Now, it's only thirty-eight years. It's a pity I'm too young." She laughed, laughing in a strange voice. She gently patted Dade's hand twice and quietly walked away.</p>
<p>Dade also felt sad for her. Seeing her walk away, he said to himself, "Too young..." His eyes looked at the newspaper again, now looking at a piece of news about the President. He suddenly had an idea... He thought of his classmate from his childhood, the "little girl"! He shrugged his shoulders, straightened his chest, and made a resolute expression.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, Gilly ran to the principal's office to see Miss Beales. She had tears on her face, and when the principal stretched out her arms and hugged her, Miss Beales patted Gilly's golden head and said, "Gilly, it's okay." Gilly cried, "This is so unfair... I argued with my father for a long time... but he wouldn't listen to me at all... He said that the matter has come to this point and cannot be changed... Miss Beales, what should I do?" Beales said, "Don't worry about me... I'm not worth anything... I'm old... everything is over, but you... you're just starting... you have a long future... Gilly, do you know? You are a talented person... a genius." Gilly kissed Miss Beales's dry cheek and said, "No matter what happens in the future, I will never do anything to hurt you again... ever and ever." She said, and walked away with a bag of tears.</p>
<p>Outside the school gate, Sandy sat in his truck, anxiously watching the school gate from time to time. After a while, Gilly came out. Sandy jumped out of the truck, helped Gilly into the truck, and jumped in himself, sitting beside her. Gilly's hand reached into Sandy's hand. She looked at Sandy with tears in her eyes and whispered, "Sandy, from now on, I will never pretend again." Sandy looked at her and said softly, "I know, you will never pretend again." He reached out one hand to hold Gilly's waist, and the other hand drove the car away.</p>
<p>The last moment is the saddest moment. The new principal had already come to discuss how to take over things. Although Melis was a little reluctant to part with the old principal, she couldn't do anything about the issue of the rice bowl. But Boz had walked away in anger to pack his things. Finally, Miss Beales was left alone in the principal's office. Peace... peace after the pain... but there was no hope anymore. He looked at a wooden plaque hanging on the wall, which was embossed with the words: "Do what is right - courage." She couldn't help but lower her head, and she couldn't stop the tears from welling up in her eyes, even though she closed her eyes tightly. (To be continued)</p>
