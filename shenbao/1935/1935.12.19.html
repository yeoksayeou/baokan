<p>數日以來。美國方面盛傳羅斯福總統將提出中立法之修正案。明年一月國會開會。將以此案爲討論之中心。總統之有此舉。　深知目前之中立法案。不能使美國　付嚴重之國際環境。假使遠東之戰爭開始。美國如依法中立。必使國家陷於空前之危局而不能自拔。蓋法案规定。一逢任何國家間發生戰爭。美國立卽宣吿中立。禁止軍火對交戰國之輸出。及宣佈人民在戰爭區域之旅行政府不加保護也。此項規定。僅足以壯遠東侵略國家之膽。而束縛美國在遠東行動之自由。</p>
<p>中立法之原意。在於使美國避免加入歐洲方面之戰爭。故其根據爲第一次世界大戰之經騐。然目前美國之理想敵人。不再歐洲。而在遠東。當海軍會議開幕之際。美國方面卽有日本炸毀美國都市之計畫發現。而外交委員會主席畢德門竟指遠東某國爲盜匪。美國人民及政府對於東亞之關心。對於侵略者之痛恨。可見一斑。使目前之中立法案不加修改。則假定此等侵略國家一旦與任何國作戰。美國不但於被侵略國不作任何軍用品之接濟。且對於侵略國仍可以將棉花煤油銅鐵之類。源源輸送。其有背於美國國策及有害於世界和平。昭然若揭也。</p>
<p>且中立法內容。亦頗不完全。如於戰時貿易僅限軍火一項。依羅斯福之意。使限制貿易有效。必將禁止輸出品及於煤油棉鐵之類。蓋前次美國之捲入大戰。與　謂軍火商所促成。無　謂農產品及工業品出口商所促成也。又原　於　國對交戰國之放帳放債。旣無禁止。於各國在美之宣傳。亦無限制。凡此諸端。下屆國會必加以討論。而討論問題之最重要者。卽美國對於侵略國家是否同樣待遇。政府對於破壞國際和平及損壞國際條約者是否予以相當制裁。觀前數日赫爾國務總統理之對華北問題之聲明。則美國對於集體和平及國際制裁。仍甚重視也。</p>
<p>今海軍會議已呈日薄崦嵫之現象。日美二國之外交關係。已達空前之危勢。一九三六年將迫。美國在軍事上雖已作積極之準備。而在外交上則尚無甚準備。中立法案之提出修正。其用意蓋在於此乎。</p>

<p>日內瓦　一般人對於意阿爭議之注意、今日集中於日內瓦、因國聯行政院將開會考慮英法和平方案及對意油禁問題也、英代表艾登將說明英國之立塲、故萬目暌暌、咸集注於艾登、衆料艾登必仍以此種和平方案非欲强施諸任何方面、但僅提出作討論根據爲言、除國聯接受外、並不欲推進之也、艾登且將重伸英國願參加國聯所議决任何集體行動之意、如此和平方案果被推翻、而十八人委員會重提油禁問題、則應付因油禁實施而發生之任何事變之集體責任問題、定將成國聯積極討論之事件、傳說和平方案中有假使阿薩白港割與阿國、則阿國不得沿通至海岸的狹長土地敷築鐵路之條文、茲悉此說實屬誤會、蓋齊拉口岸割與阿國、則關於通至齊拉之狹長土地、或不免有此規定耳（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>意未派代表出席</p>
<p>日內瓦　國聯會行政院今晨開會時、意國政府並未指派代表出席參加、據該國代表團人士宣稱、該國法西斯黨最高會議、定於本日晚間開會、關於英法兩國所提意阿爭端解决方案、自當有所决定、該國代表團未便在事前出席行政院會議、此外、意國人士并謂、自上月十八日各國實施制裁以來、該國對於國聯會所舉行各項會議、凡屬於政治性質者迄未派員參加云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿覆文表示拒絕</p>
<p>日內瓦　阿國皇帝對於英法兩國所提和平方案之正式復文、頃由該國駐法公使蓋達華德於正午十二時送達國聯會秘書處、一般人以為其內容係指責英法兩國所提方案、謂旣失之公允、又與國際法原則相牴觸、但並未明白加以拒絕、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>黑衣相激昂演說</p>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼今日演說聲明意國反抗制裁、並在東菲實施其志願之决心、吾人現與自利與偽善者周旋、此將為艱難之奮鬥、但吾人將奮鬥到底、吾人抱必勝之志、時間或須延長、但吾人所注重者勝利而非時間也、墨索里尼繼言及英法和平方案、謂意國不願遺其人民前往遼遠而野蠻之地方、除非該地方在意國保護之下耳、後又言及國聯所施之制裁、謂意國人民天良皎潔、處於正義地位、應能長期與之相抗云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>法西斯黨　最高行政會議　昨晚開會取决今後態度</h3>
<p>羅馬　法西斯最高行政會、將於今夜十時開會討論英法和平方案屆時墨索里尼對此方案報吿其意見、大的行政會將展緩數日再行開會暫時無所决議、但若果有　議　夜半或將發表公報、說明世人所亟欲聞知之意國態度、英法方案中有若干　、意政府已請予以說明衆料墨氏於接到說明後將通知英法、吿以意國所不能同意之各點、預料意國所不能同意者、　以阿薩白口崇及一狹長十地割與阿國　阿國保留阿克森聖城、又意國要求將阿國　部意國殖民之區域展至蘇丹邊境、及在海拉爾省享有特殊經濟便利、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意大利日報今日載有無名氏所著之論文、大約乃出墨索尼里之手筆、內謂法西斯最高行政會今夜集會時、對於舊歐洲或將有所論列、繼曰、意國决不能爲獲五十國贊助所組織之帝國主義的包圍所壓服意國人民對於仇對者公憤塡膺、對於企圖不許吾國勞工在光天化日卜佔一地位之帝國主義、對於昏黯紅綠黨派合圖影響意大利命運之陰謀、將出死力以拒之、陳腐不和之歐洲、故無毅力　權威、更無道德上之力量以壓服此種民族云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>意後婚戒獻國</h3>
<p>無名英雄墓前舉行莊嚴儀式　積極抵抗制裁爲全國婦女倡</p>

<h3>英法政潮避免　英閣僚諒解霍爾地位　賴伐爾獲法國會信任</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日聞內閣已議决外相霍爾無須辭職、並亦不使不管部大臣艾登辭職、現已給千艾登出席國聯行政院會議以自由行動之權、因此艾登大槪將再愼重聲明、英法兩國之和平方案並非神聖不可侵犯之物、而英國亦並不堅持國聯必須通過、法國內部之反對亦使總理賴伐爾不得不　取同樣之態度、故處此間消息靈通之觀察者之意見、日內瓦之拒絕英法方案似已成爲必然之勢、今日霍爾因病未能出席閣議、其他閣員遂得自由討論應否犧牲霍爾、以息反對、據悉艾登今日曾力促政府於星期四卞院辯論之時揭露眞相、然彼亦諒解霍爾之地位、官因恐擴大制裁、將引起戰爭故提出和平交涉、而局勢亦因之稍平云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　內閣在今晨會議之後、政潮已可避免、據聞內閣業已决定訓令不管部大臣艾登、飭向國聯會行政院聲明、關於意阿媾和問題任何建議案、均當聽由國聯會酌奪、而由實施制裁所可引起之危險、亦當由國聯會轉知各會員國共同担負、此外星期四日霍爾外相在下院發表宣言時、對於英法兩國所提之方案、不欲表示歉意、反將直率說明所以接受之理由云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下院今日責問首相鮑爾溫、英國艦隊何以在亞力山大里亞集中、鮑氏答稱、該項艦隊原駐馬爾泰、與意國東海岸頗爲接近、茲以意國報紙對英攻擊、英國軍艦在意國領海附近游弋、殊非　時、故以巡邏地點限於地中海一隅、而亞力山大里亞實爲僅可停舶之港云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　今日午後衆院開會熱烈辯論英法和平方案後、總理賴伐爾滔滔發言、爲該方案辯護、末謂若反對黨抨擊該方案者圖以可辱之條伴束縛之、則渠不願赴日內瓦出席國聯會議、故耍求衆院表决信任案而後成行、迨付表决、佔五十四票之多數、政府因以大獲勝利、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　衆議院頃於午後三時繼續討論外交部預算案、正統派社會黨領袖萊翁勃崙當發表演說云、賴伐爾總理對於意阿爭端所行政策、自當提付衆院討論、俾其表示贊同、或表示疑慮、據余所知、卽內閣本身對於外交政策亦不一致、嗣由急進社會黨議員前航空部長谷脫起立發言、謂賴伐爾總理對於意阿爭端、未能利用時機、而以集體安全制度爲基礎、在法理上樹立良好先例、此種良好先例、他日法國或有需要之處、自宜預爲之計、又謂「英法兩國所擬意阿爭端解决方案、係以瓜分阿國之法、滿足侵略國慾望、法國國會若能儘速並從長加以討論、則大多數議員、必將表示反對、而予以吾决之、夫以和解政策結束戰爭吾人固所贊同、但此種政策、若以武力强使他人接受、則非所樂聞、吾人所求者、乃獲得一種解决方案、其精神務與國聯會盟的相符合、」共產黨　員。貝利繼起發言、對於英法兩國所擬解决方案攻擊甚力、至中央派議員赫羅、則對於賴伐爾現行政策、加以贊助、並謂英法兩　所擬方案、並不强迫他人加以接受、必須國聯會與意阿兩當事國均皆接受始乃付諸實施、至是賴伐爾總理乃發表宣言云、「余在日內瓦所行政策、業於今晨向衆院說明、此外別無他項政策、諸君若認其爲危險、務當具有立卽發表意見之勇氣」云、總理並卽提出信任案而以去就相爭衆　當即表示信任、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>紐遮西城　反戰反意示威</h3>
<p>紐遮西城　今日有多人集合於此、舉行示威行動、携有反戰與反法西斯之傳單、反對將戰具運往意國、彼等整隊直赴江干、適有挪威貨船一艘斯譬羅號泊靠碼頭、裝上廢鐵準備赴意、示威者擬登輪向船長抗議、但警察業已馳至、阻止登船、示威者領袖乃立於貨箱上大聲演講、反對戰具運拌意國、而斯譬羅號之水手十九人且參加示威焉、警察驅令示威者散去、有八人被捕、以不服警察指揮也、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>捷克新總統貝奈斯</p>
<h3>貝奈斯略歷</h3>
<p>按新總統貝奈斯、現年五十一歲、出身農家、在此間大學時代專攻哲學及語言學、其時前新統瑪薩里克適在大學敎授社會學、貝氏朝夕聆講、受益匪淺、迨一九〇五年八月、貝氏遵瑪薩里克之勸吿、負笈巴黎、同時並爲潑拉格城社會主義日報、撰寄通訊、藉以糊口、一九〇六年氏着手起草博士論文、題爲「奧國問題與捷克」、其目的係在從人種語言與社會各方面、申論捷克之獨立性、貝氏在巴黎攻讀三年、至一九〇八年九月重返潑拉格城、任商業學院經濟學敎授、其時氏已正式加入瑪薩里克所領導之進步黨、迨一九一四年歐戰爆發、貝氏乃與瑪薩里克擬定復國運動進行計劃、决定由瑪氏奔走國外、貝氏則留在國內、俾隨時與瑪氏互通聲氣，直至一九一五年九月貝氏始經由瑞士、前赴巴黎、開始爲捷克復國問題、向同盟各國遊說、一九一六年其名作「燬滅匈奧帝國」一書出版、迨一九一八年十月瑪薩里克組織「捷克臨時政府」、具氏卽任爲外交部長、歐戰停戰時、氏卽以捷克外長資格參加和議、直至一九一九年九月始行返國、自此以後、貝氏對於外長一席、卽始終未有更動、一九二二年間曾一度出任國務總理、但仍兼任外長、捷克自復國以來之外交事務、悉經貝氏一手擘劃、一九二〇年與南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞兩國先後訂立協定、此爲三國成立小協商之先聲、是年貝氏出席國聯會大會、卽當選副主席、一九二三年捷克當選行政院理事、其理事一席、亦由貝氏充任、一九二四年貝氏乃與法國政府簽訂法捷兩國同盟條約、一九三二年與南斯拉夫曁羅馬尼亞兩國正式締結小協商協定、是年五月復與蘇俄訂立互助公的、距法俄兩國簽訂互助公約、爲時僅數日耳、迨九月間國聯會大會開會、貝氏經各會員國代表選任大會主席、全體會員國出席五十一國、投贊成票者達四十四國、亦可見其人望之一斑矣、邇者前總統瑪薩里克因年老倦勤、自請引退、辭職時曾向國入保薦貝氏追隨瑪氏多年、致力　國運動、其功績早爲國人所崇揚、此决當選自非偶然也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>海軍會議　英國提案之性質　以安全平等為條約原則　美將提出活動梯式條文</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日海軍會議開會、英海相孟塞爾提議、請各國代表聲明此後數年內擬造軍艦之最大噸位、噸位分配之實在性質並未規定、惟應報明五主耍類之每類噸數、此項建議含有一種見解、卽將來所成之任何條的、應載一條文、承認各簽字國之安全平等、並得籌施國家安全所必要之軍備計畫、約中並不載明實在之數字、惟將以載有噸位總數之片面宣言附於的後、以爲稍次於正式之担任、俾免各國因允建造低於他國之噸位而犧牲其地位、附加之件、如何使成爲約束的義務、此全恃各國贊助英國之建議而定、聞美代表竭力主張附加之件、當有實在的約束性、衆料美代表將提出活動梯式條文、志在維持目前之比率（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議總委員會頃於午後三時、在克拉倫斯大厦開會、英國首席代表海相孟塞爾勛爵、當就英國所提「量的限制」案、加以說明、美國首席代表諾曼台維斯·日本永野及各國代表團專家多人、均皆出席、總委員會現定於星期四日午前十時半開會、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國案在於維持現行比率、故美國已聲明絕不反對、卽法意兩國亦聲稱、如縮短建艦中止之期間、亦可贊成、故猛烈反對者獨日本而已、（十七日電通電）</p>
<p>太平洋爭霸權　日美會談不得要領</p>
<p>倫敦　永野永井全權十七日上午偕隨員三人、訪問美國代表部、與美代表台維斯斯旦列費列浦等關於共通最大限度問題、交換意見、然美方堅持從來主張不讓、會談還不得要領而畢、（十七日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議日本首席代表永野今日向美國首席代表台維斯申述日本不能接受美國海軍建議之理由、日美代表今日曾舉行秘密會議、永野聲稱、羅斯福總統建議根據現有比率、各國普减海軍實力二成、日本方面因恐有海軍戰爭之可能、故不得不拒絕云、台維斯答稱、日本如與英美兩國之海軍平等、卽等於造成日本之優勢、因日本國內之海軍根據地、地位優越、且日本亦應考慮日美海軍平等之後、菲律濱及其他太平洋中之美國領土卽將不安全矣、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>變相維持比率　英日主張背道而馳</p>
<p>東京　英國提案之建艦限制、已於十七日向第一委員會提出、各國代表對於蒙塞爾之說明均分別質問、其全貌漸形明瞭、知其爲眞正之比率主義、日本方面認爲與日本根本主張大相違背、故抱有絕對反對之態度、日本海軍對於該案之見解、大致如左、</p>
<p>關於建艦宣言、其方式曾由英國在豫備會商席上有所表示、當時雖禾如此决具體、但在根本上仍無任何變更、　據此决之提案、則將宣言之限度製爲相對以至相互依存而揭出全體噸數、不採取自主辦法、而成爲相對之情形、完全實現其比率主義、故該案之重心在此一點、　將宣言方法定爲軍艦種類區別、或將建艦計劃之期間定爲六年、諸如是類均係附屬於上項重心之各種問題也云云、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>東京　海軍明年度預算衆院各派交涉　之內示會、今日上午十一時在海相官邸開會、大角海相及長谷川决官詳細說明預算之緊耍、濱田衆院議長耍求說明倫敦軍縮會議之經過、故軍務局長山本中將說明該會議迄今之情勢、繼卽質疑問答如下、島田俊雄問、何故美國不將比率主義公開、對於日本之共通最大限豈非不妨讓步、山本中將答、預備會談時英美兩國對共通最大限、曾有贊成空氣謂史坦特萊不贊同、係在全權會議時方表明、小川鄕太郎問、以英國建艦限制爲基礎之案、以爲如何、長谷川次官答、因未接公報無從言之、惟日本不贊成英國案、中島彌團决問、共通最大限之主張若不爲承認、則倫敦會議是吾决裂、卽或不被承認、而軍艦噸數問題、備砲口徑問題等、有無締結某積程度條的之意志、山本中將答、共通最大限若不被承認、則惟有决裂、對於除去量與質之協定、似母須絕對反對、日本共通最大限之主張若不能通過、則惟有决裂而已云、（十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>俄報觀察　海會成就難期</h3>
<p>莫斯科　「伊斯維斯太」報今日在「倫敦會　與日本政策」文中指出日本不願華盛頓會議所定限制、日本帝國主義在華最近步趨　其結果在强令英美兩國實行聯合行動、由此聯合行動、以保存日本實行在華計劃後所剩餘部份、</p>
<p>該報以爲近數星期日本已定計劊之意外遲延、遲不正式宣佈華北獨立、大的卽由欲使日本代表能在倫敦獲得較優良之地位、以阻止英美親善、並保證英日兩國至少暫時或表面上之合作、該報又謂日本尙有極有勢力團體、視英國爲反蘇聯戰爭中之重要與國、因此、日本尙圖能在海軍會議中獲得英國「諒解」結一協定、承認日本之向南發展、乃爲鞏固彼在北方地位、不過此稱企圖殊爲渺茫、</p>
<p>該報繼謂德國亦擬在倫敦會議中一顯身手、吾人可見彼等謀作日德聯合行動、首先壓抑英國、次則破壞英美聯結、未謂不問該會發起者之目標如何高貴、但此海軍會議决不能使公正觀察者稍存推進和平及裁减軍倘奢望、咸覺該會必將失敗、尤以日本處於該會中心地位、而其行動及目的則與該會之努力正相反對、（十八日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>美陸軍部實施　擴充空軍程序　添建戰鬭機百架</h3>

<h3>英海軍界聞人主訂　英美防守條約　足以阻止任何國侵略</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議目前正在進行之中、今日英國海軍界聞人貴族院議員史德拉鮑爾奇與美聯社訪員談話、建議英美兩國締結海軍防守條的、史氏謂該的中最重要之規定、應爲英國以衝要地點之軍港、連同行將完工之新加坡海軍大根據地在內、一併開放、使美國艦隊、得同樣使用、同時美國對英國海軍、亦開放各地美國之軍港、船塢、及燃料站等、如此即可防止任何國家、在海洋中實行侵略、且此項條的、他國亦可參加、「予深知美國國會中主張孤立者將反對此項計劃、而英國之大海軍派亦不能贊同、因此項條的成立之後、彼等之造艦主張、卽將缺少一項理由、然以最近英法兩國之協定觀之、法國已允許於英國艦隊被攻之時、英艦得用法國軍港、則端倪已見、將來容有成功之望」云、史氏並主張海軍新協定中、應廢照巨型戰艦、惟目前美國堅持巨艦大砲主張、而英國堅欲增加巡艦、由五十艘至七十艘、故彼以爲海軍會議、絕無成立協定之基礎、「現在醫治一切國家海軍瘋之希望、惟有納稅人之革命耳」云云（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>是日舉行大遊行請願運動、當局方面、雖早有戒備、惟各校學生皆於早六時分別出校、赴預先議定之地點集齊、結果、卒得舉行成一萬餘學生大遊行示威運勸、城內外交通斷絕終日、全市沸騰、誠爲五四運動後悲烈壯舉、茲分誌詳情如次、</p>
<h3>沿途軍警戒備森嚴</h3>
<p>學生此次出動、事先甚為秘密、各校學生、均於睡夢中聞得號令而集合、故地方當局、事先均無所聞、迨學生出動後、始分途增加警備、但因不知學生出動路綫、乃臆斷必去外交大樓、故均將雄厚之警備力、佈置於王府井左右、水龍帶盤繞王府井大街西端及東單一帶、同時市政府左右均加崗衛、公安局戒備允嚴、蓋南有前門、北有天安門、皆素日學生集合之地、故該地警衛、三五步即一崗、凡行人向和平門前門方向者、皆加以盤查、行人三五成羣瞭望者、亦被驅散、西河沿一帶、關係外城學生必經之路、亦加以特別警備、警車隊等均荷槍實彈、自行車羅列身旁、東交民卷　道、亦有警衛、對三五學生結隊喁語者均趕散、同時由西單至長安街並至王府并等路綫、均有救火機及公安隊汽車穿梭警備、另有二十五軍二百九—團及九十一團兩團官兵、全副武裝遊行彈壓市面、迫擊砲及　關槍均隨行、</p>

<h3>靑年熱血淋滿街頭</h3>
<p>迨至南池子中間、突有大批警察及保安隊、一面用兩架水龍放水噴擊學生、一面用鐵棍及指揮刀實行與學生衝突、當時學生個個抱定爲國犧牲精神、雖赤手空華、亦毫不示弱、糾察隊奮勇當先、大演奪刀慘劇、其餘學生、一鼓向前、實行與警察肉搏、結果、卒將水龍奪下、是役警察與學生互有受傷、後大隊繼續南行、並高呼勝利口號、歡迎民衆自由參加愛國運動、出南池干西行、入西長安街經前軍分會門前時、父與大批軍警衝突、警察以兩次失敗於　生、故此决迎擊甚烈、大刀鐵棍、着處無情、是役學生被擊傷者十餘人、終以軍警密佈、不能突出、不得已遂折回東向出前門、冀與師大等校集合、</p>
<h3>西城學生突圍情形</h3>
<p>淸華燕大兩校學生、除一部於是晨臨時出動、由西便門衡入外、於十五日進城之燕京·淸華·兩校學生二百餘人、於早九時由西　門會合東北大學學生沿北溝沿南行、至祖家街與北平大學工學院及華北學院學生一百餘人、又會合南行、沿途亦高呼口號、羣情激昂、市民住足予以極大同情、大隊經武衣庫東口、即被當地警察以武力衝散、旋即集合、的錡湖·五三·志成·等校學生一百餘人、仍南行、至龍坑、與弘達中學及中國大學學生一百餘人會合、大隊至此、又被軍警以武力衝散且有弘達學生吳鍾琨及中大學生一名被捕、大隊復集合、至西單北與西來之民國學院學生及北平大學法商學　學生一百餘人會合、當民國學院學生出校時、會與軍警衝突、當時有學生二名受傷、大隊復南行、出　武門至廠甸、師範大學一百餘人、即突破重團之警戒綫參加、此時與軍警衝突、有文學院女生經昌榮被捕、大隊復南行至天橋、</p>

<h3>天橋集合决議進城</h3>
<p>迨城內外各校學生大隊取得聯絡後、於晨十一時集合於天橋、計有燕京大學·淸華大學·師範大學·北京大學·東北大學·交通大學·輔仁大學·北平大學五學院·鐵路學院·華北學院·中國學院·民國學院·及中山中學·匯文中學·中華中學·華北中學·弘達中學·蒙藏學校·東北中山中學·精業中學·河北高級中學·女二中等四十餘校、學生總數一萬餘人、當即露天開大會、由北大同學某君登電事上作激昂之講演、羣情異常興奮、黨議决前赴外交大樓、遂整陣返城、</p>
<h3>在前門開市民大會</h3>
<p>各校學生於呼口號、散放傳單、至前門城門緊閉、有二十九軍兵士及武裝警察列隊以待、大隊旣不得入城、即在西車站開市民大會、市民參加者甚衆、當議决、赴外交大樓向宋哲元請願、並决定將當日情形、電知全國、推北大師大淸華等各校起草、時軍警愈加增多、漸取包圍之勢、各校學生臨時推舉代表接洽開城門入城、軍警初時不應許、且向天鳴槍示威、羣衆不為所動、繼續對車警責以大義、後幾經接洽、始允可通過宣武門、迨大隊向西移動後、軍警又突自中間衝斷、復經交涉、乃允北大中院華北等校入前門、甫入城軍警自後襲擊、秩序大亂、一部學生被驅入華北中學、經過此次襲擊、所餘尙有五百餘人、乃經司法部街羢綫胡同至宣武門內又行集會、併向守鬥軍警要求開城接進城外學生、該地軍警約一營之多、不惟不允開城、且將推舉之代表扣留、以大隊回轉爲釋放代表之條件、大隊不得已轉回、軍警又以大刀鐵棒自後襲擊、一時受傷者甚多、隊伍乃被衝散、</p>
<p>學生游行情形</p>
<h3>警察開槍學生不動</h3>
<p>當大隊先鋒抵前門西車站前時、內二區署長朱約之、恐學生進城、當令警士開槍、槍聲響後、羣情更為激昂、剎那間秩序大亂、前外大街商舖均關閉、惟遊行學生多不動、後又有外四區等、開槍共二十餘響、幸未傷及學生、時公安局警車隊長任東英、出面與學聯會總代表交涉、結果、允北大等校、部學生由前門進城外、其餘大隊、可允由宣武門進城、並由警車隊引導、遊行學生認為滿意、即準備出發、時有人提議再開大會、當經通過、計决議九要案、內容從略、</p>
<p>城門關閉後情形</p>
<h3>宣武門閉學警僵持</h3>
<p>大會閉幕後、學生即沿西行、羣情激昂、高呼口號、出香爐營至宣武門、學生見宣武門緊閉、當即與警察交涉、警察方面要求條件、爲淸華·燕京·農學院三校同學先至西便門後、宜武門可開放、惟學生方面要求條件、爲宣武鬥先開放、至城內同學進城後、城外學生、即可由西便門返校、更須立即釋放被捕同學、且保障城內同學進城後、不得武裝壓迫、警察方面、堅持須城外學生至西便鬥、方能開放宣武門故仍堅持、學生方面、則决議如不開放宣武鬥、同學即露宿街頭至明日再遊行、此時有一清華代表盧璀、由宣武鬥大門底下欲圖進城、當即被捕、而宣武門外尙有燕大·北大·濟華·等校之一部學生、鵠立街頭、</p>
<h3>鵠立講演悲壯凄愴</h3>
<p>旣决定露宿後、各校學生派代表分別購辦食物、因學生皆由早七點出發一粒未下、東北大學學生二百餘人、凖備枵腹過夜、師範大學及附中男女同學、捐資購買燒餅千餘套、贈與東北大學充飢、是時各校學生分別向市民講演、全體學生、哭聲凑愴、團立兩旁之市民、無不落淚涕泣、追至晚七時餘、在城外各校學生、多有返校率領學校工友、携大批被褥及冷水供給露宿同學應用者、</p>
<h3>宣外痛擊大隊驅散</h3>
<p>惟至九時、有一部學生提議、大隊應返師範大學開會、以備再接再厲之舉、當時全體一致通過、於是大隊於黑影憧憧中、循大街向南蠕動、前鋒抵菜市口、因此地預有大批軍警戒備、故當時即與學生衝突、警察除以水龍噴擊學生外、並以槍把木棍痛擊、學生因徒手不能抵禦、前隊紊亂、向後退却、不料後隊亦遭預佈之大批警察以木棍襲擊、此時大街兩旁商舖閉門、住戶闔戶、大隊學生進退無路、慘遭棍傷及槍把擊傷者甚夥、當時學生呼救聲、哀鳴聲、慘不忍聞、尤以中學部之女生、因年齡幼小、素不慣於行路、經此終日遊行、長途跋涉後、已不勝舉步、此時經其猛烈痛擊、多匐匍不能逃避、經一時半、始將全隊驅散、據聞此次受傷學生、約在百數十人、</p>
<h3>分逃各校暫時避難</h3>
<p>至十時許、宣外大街大隊遊行學生、被警察痛擊驅散後、一部進校塲口西行、一部進西草塲口東行、因時已入深夜、大街通衢、皆臨時戒嚴、盤詰行人、大部遊行學生、皆係城內學校學生、故均不能返校歸宿、故除一部分散投宿城外親戚友家外、其餘一部學生、聞已分竄至師範大學及東北大學南校暫避、並聞有於師範大學再度開會、惟結果未詳、</p>
<h3>宋哲元勸吿學生書</h3>
<p>平津衛戍司令宋哲元發表　吿學生書云、「近來各大學生四出請願、其意義如為單純的愛國行動、自為社會所同情、更為哲元所敬佩、但據確實報吿、學生團體中頗有不少共黨份子、大多數純潔學生、皆受共黨份子轉欺騙煽動、供其利用驅使、荒廢學業、至可痛惜、哲元之澈底的反共態度、久為共黨所仇視、乘機活動、乃屬意中之事、不過大多數學生就認淸共黨的陰謀與救國的正當途徑、而加以理智的辨別、避免淺薄的盲從、冀察政務委員會與西南之政務委員會、並無二致、旣係中央之命、當然有其應設之必要、哲元本一軍人、對政治固非所長、然爲國爲民、不甘落後、一切措施、悉以整個國家利益爲基準、决不能爲少數共黨份子之宣傳而受影響、最後盼望凡屬明大體識大義之學生、應立即覺悟、安心求學、勿再為無益之奔走、其少數共黨份子、如仍有軌外行動、哲元爲維持秩序安定人心計、决予以適當之制止、宋哲元、」</p>

<p>精神運動派與自由主義派的暗鬥</p>
<p>三、保守主義的勃興</p>
<p>就上面所說，我們可知以西園寺公望爲中心的元老重臣，是主張以自由主義民本主義，爲治國的基礎的，但是日本現在還有排斥重臣們的保守主義派。現在這派的勢力漸興、差不多有凌駕自由主義派的聲勢了。自從加藤高明伯爵組織護憲三派，政黨內閣輪流守護了立憲政治許多年，這可稱爲政黨黃金時代。可是近年資本主義的膨賬，使國民生活，日趨窮迫。民衆不堪現實的苦痛，「打倒自由卞義一的運動就風靡全國這運動中右傾的急進派，以「打開局面」相標榜，傾向於法西斯蒂中義排斥重臣論者，乘機而起，常與西園寺爲中心的重臣派爲難。現在雙方傾軋得十分歷害。這也可以說是「武斷派」對「文治派」的衝突。武斷派以田中光顯爲中心，亦稱爲保守派，是聯合軍人與民間右冀團體，所形成的。可是這派，因爲時勢所抑壓，還不能怎機顯露頭角。所以田中光顯鬱鬱不樂，隱居鄕間。但田中係伯爵，是陸軍少將，曾任宮內大臣，明治維新時，與太戶大久保西鄕隆盛等同爲有數的武士們，今年已九十二歲，精神矍鑠。他常常以私見，與重臣們爲雞。重臣們亦碍於歷史關係，無可如何。他以本來面目，發揮武士的氣槪。聽說九一八滿洲事變發生後，他大不滿於重臣們的行爲。曾經「帶劍進宮，兵諫日皇。」日皇亦嘉許其志操，面加慰藉呢。</p>
<p>與田中最莫逆的，爲淺野長動侯爵。淺野係名門後裔，曾任公使，及元老院議官。明治二十三年創設國會，他仟貴族院議員。曾經爲了「天皇機關說」與田中彈劾過一木。今亦隱居廣島。</p>
<p>崇奉田中等的保守思想，又能近代化，列於重臣中者。爲現樞密院副議長平沼騏一郎男爵。平沼久在司法界服務，歷任檢察廳長，司法大臣，樞密院顧問官，副議長。他以日本主義爲思想的基礎，提倡精神運動，宜揚固有道德。他可以說是日本法西斯蒂運動的領袖，現陸軍巨頭荒木貞夫眞崎甚三郎，與他關係甚深。他所提倡的精神運動，以「質」爲主眼，與偏重「量」的民主主義，大不相容。近來他就利用一部份園民的心理，提倡打開現狀。本年五六月間，他利用「天皇機關說」問題，意圖推翻岡田內閣。可是平沼的思想，在陸軍部內勢力不大。海軍部內，那就完全與他不愜。元老重臣方面，更說他非掌握政權的人。所以他的獨脚戲，仍舊演不出風頭來。樞密院議長倉富辭職，照例應由平沼昇任，但重臣們权力反對，保藨一木。平沼因此憤恨，排斥重臣，常然比其他爲烈。</p>
<p>四、天皇機關說</p>
<p>排斥重臣的空氣，起於「天皇機關說。」這問題在上次議會，巳成爲論爭的中心。今夏以來，越加激烈。最近已從主張上的爭執，進而追究本質了。「精神運動」派要把這件案子作投向「現狀維持」派的致命的炸彈。參加這運動的人，種類很多，有純粹的精神運動派，也有利用這問題作爲倒閣的工具的。如貴族院之菊池武夫井田磐楠井上淸純等男爵，三室戶敬光子爵，軍閥中之大井成元，石塚英藏赤池濃，動選議員細川護立，德川義親侯爵等，衆議院中政友會之山本悌二郎，鈴木總栽·久原·鳩山·島田等幹部，以及其他右翼團體差不多全部附和，軍部的態度允爲强硬。陸軍的渡邊敎育總監，阿部信行大將，對天皇機關說，曾經强迫前陸相林銑十郎，彈劾一木，林乃向同岡田首相提出「國體明徽」三大主張。第一，由內閣名義，聲明取消機關學說。第二，下令訂正著書並禁止發售。第三，處分信奉機關說者。然而信奉機關說者，除美濃部達吉（貴族院議員爲日本憲法大家）的著作者外，還有一木樞密院議長與金森法制局長。政府爲顧全面子起見，於八月三日第一决聲明否認天臺機關說，共後於中月十五日，經閣議决定第二次聲明，糾正「統治權主體，不在天皇而在國家，天皇爲國家的機關」等謬說，闡明「統治權的主體，是在天皇。」這兩决聲明，經政府與軍部幾次折衝，成立妥協。然而不滿一木，反對重臣們，以及藉此倒閣的各派，還是不肯干休。大家以刷新人事的要求，壓迫政府。然而元老重臣，究竟是製造內閣，左右國政的最高分子，被稱爲「守護立憲政治的神祇」者。他們叉團統堅固，形成「重臣同盟」對反對派防衛很嚴，所以反對派雖屢欲乘機而動，而事實上根深蒂固的元老重臣，是一時不能打倒的。况且就最近日本的國民性觀測，反對派也未必得到多數國民的同情。譬如本年二府三十七縣的府縣會議員總選舉，右翼團體依然不振。可見政黨的信用，仍舊很大，議會政治的根抵，不容易動搖呢。</p>
<p>「重臣同盟」除了本身的勢力以外，還有外層的勢力。這就是他們所聯合的，以薩派與準薩派爲中堅的官僚。現首相岡田啟介，與重臣們關係很深。因爲岡田是齋藤所推蔿的。現在齊藤是「重臣同盟」的總參謀長，也可以說重臣的盟主。如果反對派要把一木和齋藤打倒，勢不得不牽運牧野伸顯與山本權兵衛。這是關係太大了。一木是他所奏薦的。一木因憤反對派的攻擊，曾欲辭職，但因環境關係，卒不能　然引退，這就是重臣們內部團結的表徵。</p>
<p>日本年來精神運動派與自由主義派暗　的情形，大致如此。我們要明白今日元老重臣的勢力，這是不能不連帶說到的。本文參考書　K生「日本元老重臣論」　YH生「政權的歸趨」　「重臣同盟的動搖」</p>

<h3>上海工商業概况</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>上海之水泥業　（續）</p>
<p>（四）製造程度　製特以原料之性質血巽。如中國，上海等公司製造，皆採用半濕法。其法俟原料運廠後，將灰石倒入軋石機使碎　粘士則傾入洗濯磨打成泥漿，然後由運送　輸入泥斗，再陸續投入混和種；灰右壓碎後，即人管磨使成細粉，乃輸入灰石斗而達混和機　以某種比例　與泥漿混合攪勻後，如未達預定比例，酌加灰石或泥漿，使合比例。迨經密切混合後·即運至泥漿池，再放入旋轉窰燒之。在滬漿未　入以前，須用煤粉將之高溫，煤係在窰內燃燒，故須磨成細粉，光將碎煤運至乾燥房烘乾，乾後用管磨磨成細粉，利用疾風吹人窰中，燃燒時、泥槳山窰，後端繼續放入，煤粉則山前端吹進，故泥漿用後端轉至前端時，溫度即逐漸增加，迨至前端溫度　高，泥已成熟後，山前端小孔落地，然後裝入球磨磨細；同時將磨細之石膏粉送至木斗，山此掃入球磨，與熟料配和；在磨勻後，即成水泥，惟須再將决泥過節，粗者再磨細　放入地窰事貯藏，然後送入裝桶　，分別裝入。查啟新公司出品，每袋可盛水泥　百八十七磅半，每桶可裝一袋，計　三百七十五磅；上海及中國兩公司則專以桶爲單位，每桶容量，的爲二百八十一磅半。</p>
<p>（五）供求情形　據查我國水泥每年銷量約五百餘萬桶，而親有各廠年產的在三百萬桶，不足之數，仰給於香港，安甫，德國，我國及大連小野田水門汀會社及淺野水泥會社，政府有鑒於此，最近乃聯合實業家多人。擬在京組織大規模水泥公司，預料將來我國水泥，當能自給矣。</p>

<h3>改良中國樂器的問題（三）</h3>
<p>— 丁爕林</p>
<p>在這個問題未曾得到純粹的科學的答復之前、物理學家已經吿訴我們聲音是空氣的振動、音律的高低是完全由振動的快慢而定、說得簡括一點、音律就是振動的頻率音的和諧與否、要看振動的頻率是吾恰成簡單的比率、與管長弦長並沒直接的關係、並且從物理學上、我們知道、成簡單比率的管長弦長、精密的講、並不能發出頻率成簡單比率的振動、結果管長弦長雖成簡單的比率而音律並不絕對的和諧、反過來說、管長弦長、雖不恰成簡單的比率、如果振動的頻率恰成簡單的比率、即可以發出絕對和諧的音律、因此我們可以斷定、研究音律、非認淸了振動頻率的觀念根據科學的方法製樂器、內　想能仍從「河圖」「洛書」「陰陽」「氣候」的哲理、或用方容圓、圓內容方的算術、希望得到和諧的「律管」、是絕對　望的、這是我們對於音律上知識進化的第二階段、為甚麼頻率成簡單比率的振級能和諧、頻率不成簡單比率的振動即不能和諧、是不是我們的耳朶不但懂得簡單的算學、並且喜歡簡單的算學、對於這個問題的科學答復、是大物理學家Helmholtz的貢獻　單簡的講、和諧的感覺、不是我們的耳朶對於某種的聲音覺得悅耳、是對於某種聲音覺得刺耳、這刺耳的聲音、就是音學上頻率相近的兩種聲音所產生的「拍聲」、頻率成簡單比率的各音之所以悅耳、是因爲他們不產生刺耳的「拍音」的原因、這是我們對於音律上知識進化的第三階段、這個問題距本文題目較遠、我們可以不再多說、關於中國音律方面、我們還得特別提一提、明代朱載堉所發明的平均上二律、近代西洋音樂所通用的平均十二律的音階組織、確與朱氏所主張者盡同、不過近代西洋音樂之所以採用平均十二律、並不是因爲這種音律是一種理想的音階組織、是因爲解决「變調」在樂器構造上所發生的困難問題的一種遷就的辨法、平均十二律的組織是不合乎嚴格的音律理論的、道一點是西洋音家所知道而朱載堉所未知道的、朱氏生在三百年前科學未發達的時代、我們說這話當然不是責備朱氏、不過極端推崇朱氏的人、對於這一點是應當了解的、</p>
<p>以上所說是全屬於音律的「方面、中國固有的音樂文化與樂器有關的除去音律、尙有樂器本身的一方面、西洋的樂器製造、在科學未發達之前、即已有驚人的成續、即到現在有許多問題、仍全靠經騐與嘗試、雖然從經騐得來的一件完美的樂器、九以科學的研究、可以得到科學上的解釋、但科學還不能完全指示任何一件樂器或仟何樂器的一部分製造的方式、我們所聽到從一件樂器所發出的聲音、是經過樂器各部的傳遞所發出來的、這些傳遞的部分、在好的一方面、可以本於共鳴的作用、改善原昔的音色、在壞的一方面、可以羼加本身所發生的不和諧的聲音、提琴古琴的木料與中空的構造的重要竹苖與銅笛音色的不同、幾乎是人人所能經騐的、更有若干種樂器有「年齡」和「工夫」的關係、年齡愈老、工夫愈深、品格伸愈好、所以中國果有由古代傳下優良樂器、是値得寳貴、値得研究的、而書本上關於樂器的說明、說不定也有很多材料可供改良中國現有樂器的參考、</p>
<p>最後我們可以將極顯明的中國現有樂器應加改良之點簡單分述如下、</p>
<p>一切樂器的音律應一律採用西洋音樂所公用的音律、一切音律固定的樂器、如笙·笛·琵琶、月琴·鑼·鼓·之類、都應加以改良或改造、使各有規定準確之音、庶可合奏、</p>
<p>音階的組織、應採用平均十二律、一切多音的樂器應盡量的增加「半音」弦樂器之用「品」者增加「品」的數目、簫與笛增加音孔、笙增加音管、以便可以演奏近代的樂曲、即以演奏極簡單的樂曲說、簫與笛都至少可以增加一孔、以便可以分奏原來常奏的「正工」與「小工」的兩種曲調、</p>
<p>音域應當盡量的增加、中國樂器音域太狹、高音部與低音部的樂器、允其是低音部、應設法補充、笙·簫·笛·都可以分高音與低音的數種、每種音域似乎都不難增加到將近三「均」、至少兩均半是斷無問題的、洋琴似乎可以由兩均半增加到四均、中國的簫與笛所用的內徑、一向是全部大小一致的、爲得到高音與低音音量的調和起見、應仿照西洋笛的構造、改成內徑大小不同的兩節、依照目前中國簫的構造、重吹所發出之倍律、都嫌太高、這僩毛病、似乎可以從吹口一端的構造上設法改除之、</p>
<p>以上所舉幾種樂器應加改良及可以改良之點、不過是就中央研究院物研究所儀器工塲一年來對於樂器工作所及、作爲舉例與說明、其他樂器之應常改良者當然甚多、即拿以上所述的各點來講、因爲工作僅在起頭、所得經騐有限、未見到的地方自所難免、也統望能得專家的指正、（完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（二）（八）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我的寳貝，你爲什麽哭了？」他母親問道，那時她還是依依在他的左右呢·</p>
<p>「我哭因爲我迷失了」，羅勃呼喊道：耍想擠出一點眼淚來，可是完全失敗了。</p>
<p>「不過你現在已經回來了。南恩說他在那邊倒沒有哭，我們贊美你是一個勇敢的童子。」</p>
<p>「我那時受了驚嚇，沒得時間去哭。不過現在我要哭了，因爲我是不願迷失的」，羅勃解釋道，說時，他却顯出已被睡魔，悲袞所侵襲，一面叉正在和一口的麵包牛奶苦苦掙扎呢。</p>
<p>童子們想到他這麼追補的方法不禁失笑，因此羅勃也停下來看着他們，可是人人露着那麼笑樂的情緒，所以在他驚奇的睇視之後，他也迸發出一種喜樂的「哈，哈！」擲他的調羹在桌子，彷彿他也十分欣寶那件笑話咧。其時裴先生一看他的錢，說道：「這是十點鐘了；往床上去，你們個個人。」</p>
<p>「還是謝謝天，今晚也沒有一個床空着，裴夫人叉接着說道，兩眼汪在着羅勃挨入他父親的懷中，還有南恩有小梅和小橋陪伴着前去，他們覺得她正是他們一道夥裹最有趣的一個重要脚色呢。</p>

<p>新年送禮專號（上期）</p>
<h3>貢獻話　談談送禮</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>人是富有感情的，惟其有情，便有往來之禮，這禮便是代表朋友親戚間的情戚。古人所謂「禮尙往來，來而不往，非禮　；往而不來，亦非禮也。」便是很好的解釋。我們不跟外國入做聖誕節，可是新年轉瞬到了，依着習慣，朋友親戚間，免不了有送禮的舉動，可是人人怕送禮，允其怕人家送來的禮。爲什麽怕呢？怕的是送了不應該送的禮，和不需要的禮。把外國貨送入，是不應該的，把無益的禮品，和許多人不歡喜的禮品，是不需要的。所以送禮問題，是要仔細研究的，並且要看各人的地位，和各人的所好，不可隨便致送，反使人我兩方都得不到好處。吾認爲送禮不在厚薄，而在適用與不適用。不在多少，而在需要與不需要。古人說：「寳劍贈予烈士，紅粉贈予佳人。」倘使把寳劍送給佳人，紅粉送給烈士，豈不是鬧着笑話嗎？所以送禮第一要適用，要需要，允應投合各人的所好，而不在誇多鬥勝。從前有個淸官陸隴其先生，上官做壽，人家送禮的很多，並且很闊，可是陸先生却帶了夫人新織的土布，所製的草鞋。這倒是一片至誠，於己表示節儉，於人十分買用，我們很可取法。所以送禮不必多化錢，擺虛面子，只要人家適用需要，雖是區區禮物，也覺情意很重的。這樣說來，送禮第一要揀國貨，第二要揀實用需要的國貨，第三要揀可以長久紀念的國貨，第四要揀各個家庭不可少的轟貨，第五要揀人家接到以後，可以得益受用的國貨。同時還不要忘記送了實物以外還有國貨的禮券，可以使受的人購用自由，不受拘束呆板的麻煩，這種辦法，目前倣行的很多，不論什麽時候，都可實行的。本刊因爲將近新年，特輯禮品專號，以貢獻於社會士女們，做研究送禮問題的參考。</p>
<h3>怎樣送禮</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>韶華催人！剎那間又已歲尾年頭了！戚友們酬酢往來，互相餽禮，聯絡情誼，事理之常，無可厚非！然則究竟怎樣送禮的一問題，値得大家來討論了，古人說：「千里送鵝毛，禮輕情重」與其作「錦上添花」母寗效「雪中送炭」省無謂的消費，增實際的效用！吾們應早購備有益的國貨是尙！</p>
<p>送戚友們吃的東西，還不如送戚友們用的禮品來得好！</p>
<p>如：雙錢牌的各種熱水袋，麂皮手套，三角牌香皂，竹報平安的毛巾，鵝牌絨綫衫，景德鎭的金邊茶杯，手牌，羝羊牌，皇后牌等絨綫，結就小人帽，襪子，手套餽贈親友們的兒女，或者多買國貨的格言　曆，日記冊，信箋……等等，比較什麽糖菓，玩具有意義而實用得多！</p>
<p>萬一眞要點綴一些吃的東西，那麽蔣腿和鐵錨牌葡萄酒等，總以國貨爲前提，於無形中增强親友們的國貨印象，這是區區的管兒，想亦爲讀者所樂聞的吧！</p>
<h3>贈給兒童的禮物</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>國難這樣的嚴重；水災這樣的廣漠，時序的巨輪，雖然轉到了最末的季節；最後的幾天，可是我們對於送禮，却未能免俗。</p>
<p>禮，固然是耍送的，可以增進戚友的情感，也可以使貨物產銷遞加，而轉使社會上的商業呈露活躍的氣象。最痛心的，國人去買洋貨送禮。現代潮流的趨向，提倡國貨是最時髦的，也是人類應盡的天職。今年年禮，如果再去買洋貨送禮，我恐怕非但得不到受的人歡迎，反要遭人唾棄吧？以期買洋貨送禮，倒不如把這筆欵助爲水災賑欵實惠些。</p>
<p>兒童是中國未來的主人翁，關於它一切的一切，都應格外注意！新年贈給兒童的禮物，我們選擇要留意，萬萬勿可買洋貨！使兒童養成用洋貨的習慣。最妥善的禮品，購些有益心身的兒童讀物，培養它的知識。並且見童讀物的內容，都富有趣味性的，兒童一定是很歡迎的。如果耍送其它物品，像五洲藥房出品的地球牌麥精魚肝油，也是很好的，可以培補身體，將來替國家出力。成是要玩的方面，可選啟發兒童科學思想的玩具，使它腦海巾印入科學探討的趣味。</p>
<p>中國人，如果人人能注意敎養兒童，還怕將來沒有强盛的一天嗎？這是做父母應負的絕大使命！</p>
<h3>我家的送禮</h3>
<p>— 浦曼彬</p>
<p>我做了一家的主婦，談到送禮問題，倒有一些經騐，來貢獻諸位。十餘年前，我和曹伯權嫂嫂同居，曹夫人是醉心國貨的一個人，他逢到年底，必的我到熟鬧的馬路中，找着幾家著名的國貨商店，來選購禮品。曹夫入的主張，和我不的而同，都是要買實用的國貨物品，來送給人家。允其高興剪些衣料送人，所以三友實業社，是時常有我們兩人的足跡，不退色的自由布，一年中問倒要買他不少。而搪瓷品，衛生衫，肥皂，襪子，絨繩等，我們也是當作年節餽贈的禮品，倘使有人買了烟酒或外國貨，或不巾用的玩具送入，我們老實不客氣，要敎訓他幾句，所以我們的里內，在家嫂嫂許家嫂嫂，蔡家嫂嫂等，都是跟着我們來提倡　貨，最得意的，我幾個小兒，穿了自由布制服，到學校裏去，許多人家的母親都來問我要布樣，並且托我代他們置辦，親戚鄰里間，便呌我是國貨採辦員，眞正好笑。目下新年將到，大家又要忙着送禮問題，我倒要奉勸各家賢明的夫人，千萬要記着一句話，便是</p>
<p>送禮，須簡省，須實用，允須需要</p>
<p>末了還有一句話，卽是「莫說禮輕情意重，送來一件不虛空。」</p>
<h3>新年禮品的討論</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>一年容易，又是新年，在這一年開始的新年裹，照着中國的習慣親友間是要互相送禮的。普通的人家，都是送給鷄鴨橘子之類的東西。那些來往較大的或許會買些舶來品的禮物，以示貴重。本來，送禮是維持親友間的感情的，允其是在這一年才開始的新年裏送些禮物　祝賀這個新年，倒也在人情之中，不過關於斯年禮物的選擇，倒的確有討論的必要。</p>
<p>關於送鷄鴨橘子之類的東西，那楚屬於消耗品，似乎不很適宜，但是送別的東西，那又不知人家需要什麽，如果送人家不必需要的禮物，在送禮的人是花費了不少的錢，而在受禮的人，却並不需要。所以要擇入家需要的東西，倒也很覺得困難。至於採購舶來品，一者失了提倡國貨的原意，二者如果受禮的是個提倡國貨的人，那未對於你的不愛國更會加以鄙視的而且舶來品的貨物，也未必就能使人人滿意。所以我的意思，我們選擇新年醴品，第一要注意人家的需要與否，第二更要是完全的國貨。因爲新年是我們的新年，我們的新年裏購辦新年禮物，自然要由我們的國貨了，至於什麽國貨禮物方合宜；那我以爲像三友實業社的毛巾；家庭工業社的化妝品，以及其他的日用品，都是普通人所必需的，如果餽送這種禮物，我想：接受禮物的入，一定歡迎的。假使大家以爲這種必需品，似乎不很合於送禮的條件的話，那可以購買各大國貨商店的禮券來代替禮品，接受禮物的人，可以憑着禮券去選擇自己所需要的東西，這自然可以滿意了！</p>
<p>在這裏我謹向各大國貨廠商作一個建議，就是在這新年裏，可以發行一種聯合禮券，憑這種禮券可以向任何一家國貨商店裏去領取東西，因爲這樣接受禮券的入，可以隨時向附近的公司，或者是所需耍的那個公司裹選擇所需要的物品了，如果各大國貨廠商能够實行這種辦法，那購買禮券作新年禮品的，一定不在少數，這實在是一種推廣營業的好辦法呀！</p>
<h3>新年禮品與國貨</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>一年很快地過去，時間的輪子，已快要把大好的學生國貨年，輾成了歷史的陳蹟，簇新的新年，已正在那兒向我們作甜蜜的微笑，的確，每當一個新年的來臨時，我們是總有着一種蓬勃的生氣，而對這未來的前程遠大的新年，懷着充滿前進的希望的。</p>
<p>新年是十分　　，可是，在　兒，我却又像很神經過敏地想到，並且，這也是事實，恐怕在國人普遍的崇拜洋貨的高熟下，這一個新年的到臨，却又耍給洋貨以大量傾銷的好機會，本來，國入對於新年送禮這回事，已成了一種牢不可破的習慣，而在這新年送禮之中，却就做了洋貨推銷員，像洋貨的烟酒啊！舶來的糖果，玩具，罐頭食品呵！我們可以很淸晰的記得，在這新年的前夜，都正是它盛銷的時候。記得小記者先生說過，他最不願意看着兩個老頭兒，一個是有「盛」字爲記的，紅面龐，口裹國手裹有着根烟蒂兒的，它是在華市塲的長期侵略者，一個是白鬍鬚，穿着白邊紅袍，背上一個包袱的，他每年十二月底來一次，吸收國人許多的血汗，它是一時的刦奪者，這兩句話，說得實在又痛心，又深切，使我們十分驚惕，而應該永遠記在心頭，永矢弗護的。</p>
<p>所以，在這歲闌將殘，街頭上這第二位老頭兒又已上市的時候，我懷着十二分地執誠，耍向正在趕辦新年禮品的大衆們，提出兩個殷勤的希望，第一·是耍大家提倡國貨禮品，再不要將洋貨送給人家，致被人蔑視，同時也侮辱了人家，我們是中國人，應當用中國貨，那是天經地義的一回事。第二·爲免去選擇國貨麻煩，並被洋貨的魚目混珠計，望大家可以多往國貨公司，國貨商塲，和各個國貨工廠自設的門市部去購，允其是目前幾種應時的貨品，像三角牌出品，立鵝牌火油爐，鵝牌衛生衫褲，冠牛圍糖果，美豐手套等，都是新年送禮佳品，而値得提出來介紹的。</p>
<p>大家正在很快樂地迎候新年，但我在這裏却深深地恐懼，當心在這新年中的消耗，父將送去不少大好的金錢，相反地我們正要認淸當前的危機，務須提倡國產，維護國產，那麽，未來的新年，一定為給我們更美滿的快樂的。</p>
<h3>我之新年送禮</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>霎眼之間，新年又快要到了，一到新年，大家又要不能免俗而要送禮物。在這樣的不景氣象中，所謂禮物，在緊縮的政策上，當然不送爲經濟，然而你不送禮物給人，人家却把禮物送來了，而且却之又要見到不恭，那麽受領之下，又不免要還答人家。所以你如果要單獨主張不送禮物，是難以辦到的。而我呢，到了歲尾年頭，自己離不先把禮物送去，可是有人送來，基於「禮尙往來」的原則上，便不能不把禮物送遠人家，不過我的送禮，有幾個信條：</p>
<p>總共不過四色</p>
<p>每色値價一元左右</p>
<p>完全國貨</p>
<p>假如人家送來的禮物，不止四色，而値價也不止四五元，那麽寗可先送了些去，將來再送還。</p>
<p>送來的禮物，有時可不必全受，退幾樣回去，倘然裏面有幾種是舶來品，那麼我就老實不客氣，就把這些舶來品退回去，祇受國貨，表示不歡善用淫貨，這樣入家第二年就再不會把洋貨送來了。</p>
<p>自己把禮物送人，除了絕對不買洋貨之外，更選擇平絮自己用過的價廉物美的國貨，倘然　國貨工廠發明了新的出品，而經入證明貨品非常可靠的，便買來送人，以示提倡而作介紹。</p>
<p>我想新年送禮，如果大家能够照我的提倡國貨信條，那麽一年一度的年關，至少可少送若干金錢給外國人用呢！</p>
<h3>年糕</h3>
<p>— 紀一介</p>
<p>年糕，是江浙間新年禮品之一，取其與「年高」二字諧聲，合於吉語「一年高一年」之意。</p>
<p>年糕，是糯米所製，純粹國貨，絕不沾染絲毫洋氣，此可取者一。</p>
<p>年糕，一年只做一决、年底製成後，很耐久藏，有留到决年二三日問，纔吃完者，此可取者二。</p>
<p>年糕，旣可送親友，凑作新年禮品，又可當粥當飯當點心，此可取者三。</p>
<p>年糕的種類，有桂花年糕，以蘇州市售者爲最佳，有玫瑰猪油年糕，有用猪油洗沙做饀的桂花白糖猪油年糕，有棗泥胡桃猪油年糕，有糯米年糕，（海寗最佳）有上虞年糕，（紹興上虞縣出品又名水歷年糕。</p>
<p>年糕的吃法，或蒸而食之，或起油鍋煎而食之，或加淸水煮成湯而食之，或加韭芽肉絲鷄蛋炒而食之，或用鷄湯加白菜蝦米煮成湯而食之，或烘而食之，或切成薄片風乾後，用油灼而食之，均可。惟猪油年糕只能蒸食，上虞年糕加料炒食最佳。</p>
<p>不過，年糕在臘月製者，纔可久藏不壞，故無論何地，大抵在大寒之後，立春以前，纔製年糕，至於國歷的歲尾年頭，製年糕者絕少，關於這點，不得不附帶聲明，以昭實在。</p>

<p>哈哈！新年快到了！趕快想一些禮物送給要好的戚友吧！</p>
<p>送吃的東西吧！嘴裹　嚼便完事，眞沒意思。送穿的衣料吧！別人歡喜甚麽也不知道，而且也太費錢了。送用的東西吧！知道他缺少些甚麽，而且也一時也想不出適常的東西來。</p>
<p>唔！有了！送給他一本日記簿吧！這東西價賤而又實用，各書局都有得買，而且又是國貨，一舉而數美備，好！準管買幾本去送給親友吧！</p>
<p>諸位！你們不要輕視日記簿，送給他呌他天天寫日記，準可以「進德而修樂。」古來許多大儒，沒一個不寫日記，淸代最著名的曾國藩，便是一個例子。舊觀念不提；便拿新眼光瞧來，寫日記也有許多功効。一個人生活的是吾上軌道？做事的是吾勤惰？常時是不知道的，倘使天天把他記起來，事後翻閱，對於過失，一定有所警惕而加以改良，這是第一點。人的腦力記憶力是有限的，從前做的事情，往往容易遺忘，倘使有了日記簿，把從前做的事情，和今天　照一下，倒也大有滋味，這是第二點。還有每天寫寫日記，不但文字可以長進，書法可以秀美，而且養成「有恒」和「勤勞」的習慣，對於涵餐德性，也有問接的帮助，這是第三點。</p>
<p>所以我奉勸諸位閱者們，新年的禮物，最好是日記簿，雖是價格不貴，入們不大歡迎，可是『君子愛人以德，』事後接到這禮物的人，一定要大大的感激你咧！諸位不信，不妨試一下看。</p>
<h3>我們所需要的：「傻幹」！</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>近來讀到巳故戈公振先生的一篇「最近蘇聯人民生活的一斑」後，對於蘇聯服用國貨的精神，欽佩之至。在他初到蘇聯的時候，飲食店所預備的茶，實際上僅是一杯有顏色的水，不但毫無茶味，而且還有些澀口，據說是另外一種樹葉和茶葉參雜而成。至於咖啡，據說是由一種豆類煉成，簡直就是一杯深綜色的甜茶而已，他們爲避免用外國貨，也可謂煞費苦心了。</p>
<p>貧舒服，誰不喜歡，用精緻的外國貨，誠是比用國貨來得舒服多了。可是當未用之前，大家仔細想一想：我買這一伴舶來品，就是多把錢流到外國去，多養活幾個外國人，反過來說，我買一些國貨，就是養活國貨工廠的工人，替中國民族工業前途開闢一些路。那麽，你就覺得用中國貨是遠勝於舶來品，國人們養成這種心理，我敢說無論外國商品如何侵入我們的市塲，我們也不會蒙到損失的！</p>
<p>蘇聯的人民並不是傻子，有着外國咖啡不來享用，只是他們更深一步明瞭，多省一文錢給外國人，就能多减進國家一分實力，這種傻幹精神，確是最可佩服。回頭看看中國，據海關調查，每</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>年所輸入的外國咖啡等飲料品，有百萬元之多·國人讀了，作何感想？</p>
<p>其實，中國的茶，也何嘗不是一種良好的飲料，只是國人崇拜「咖啡」，所以茶業的前途，十分黯淡。假如國人有了蘇聯人民一樣的决心，要挽救也不難的，茶業如此，別的也何嘗不如此呢！</p>
<p>張伯苓先生在國際大飯店國貨工廠歡送全運會女選手的一段演說，他責備飯店的盆子不是中國貨，檯毯不是中國貨，紅茶牛奶不是中國貨，甚至一塊紙頭也不是中國貨，這是我們公共的羞恥！的確，我們大衆忘記了「傻幹」，個個人都愛舒服，想快樂，國貨當然被摒棄的了。</p>
<p>朋友們！最近政府的幣制改革以及現銀集中，正給我們民族工業發展的一個好機會，願國人更應改去向日崇拜洋貨的劣根性，替國路的前途，擔負起一些責任，大家學蘇聯人民的服用國貨的精神吧！</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生敎訓我們是「幹，實幹，苦幹·」現在，我們再來一個「傻幹」，幹得越傻，國家就越有希望，有志的國人們！傻幹吧！</p>
<h3>對今後國展會的一點建議</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>我想，那是誰也知道的，國貨展覽會舉行的原意是什麼？因爲中國生產的落後，一般工業無疑義地還在萌芽的時期，所以，國展會的舉行，一方面是曉喻全國民衆，對於國貨的認識，由認識而起了一種堅强的信仰心，一方面是國貨工廠自身，可藉此而廣察各地市塲的情形，大衆對於國貨出品，需要如何的改良，努力改進而使業務的擴展，這是純粹要注重在宣傳而不可急於近利的一回工作。</p>
<p>但是，過去這種有意義有價値的工作，到最近來却忽常聽到許多不幸的消息，什麼國展會因低價傾銷，而與當地工商界起餒重的糾紛呵！（在南通，湖州甚至有流血的慘劇）什麽國展會均由販賣商組合而無眞實廠商呵！什麼國展會內發現洋貨呵！國展會的厄運？一至於此，這是很顯明地，可使我們曉得，最近來的國展會，它實本已失去他那最基礎的作用，僅因滬上許多廠商貨品的過剩，或是一般販賣商從中取利，他們就拿內地傾銷，開國展會爲唯一的尾閭，因此，决貨的紛紛向內地傾銷，以最低的價格，去混淆當地的市面，自然，無怪那當地的工商界，要掀起那競爭的風浪，而發生種種波折了。</p>
<p>所以，我認爲今後的國展會，首先希望參加的廠商要整齊，在赴谷地舞行前，允須與當地官民有相當的商洽，並嚴厲取締中有投機性質的販賣商參與其間，同時，大家耍把眼光放遠些，根本明瞭所以舉行的意義，我們不要專以到一個地方去謀近利爲目的，我們要務使那地方的人，對於國貨出品，有個良好的深切的印象就够，而在國展會閉幕後，尙有兩個很本的工作，須要努力進行，現在，我把他寫下來，以供參考：</p>
<p>第一，創設永久性的機關　於國展會後，可觀察該地情形，由國貨廠商單獨自設發行所，或由數廠組合創辦國貨聯營所與國貨公司等，共同進行謀永久性營業的機關。</p>
<p>第二，聯絡當地殷實販賣商　擇當地殷實可靠的販賈商，或消費合作社等，我們應與其極誠聯絡，嚴好訂立合同，專銷國貨，於國展會閉幕後，可仍繼續向滬上廠商訂購。</p>
<p>總之，我們要把國展會做一個向內地市塲推銷國貨媒介的橋樑，它正有着宣揚國貨，復興整個　　　　　　　呵！</p>
<h3>亟應創設照相材料廠的獻議</h3>
<p>— 葉奕顧</p>
<p>近年來，中國的國貨工業，可以說已經有了很大的進步。因着國貨工業的進步，所以，過去國人所用的外國貨品，現在因爲有了自己所能做出的好貨品可以替代，於是大家就一致的捨棄了洋貨，而愛用國貨了。要在這一方面找幾個例子來說明，那末，就把我們平日用的火柴·肥皂·棉織品等來講，已可想見一般了。因爲從前我們用的火柴，大多屬於瑞典等幾個國家，現在中國的大中華大華等廠，已將舶來火柴漸决打倒。至說肥皂棉織品等，那末，近數年來，我們中國關於肥皂棉織品等的廠家之興起，亦委實如雨後春筍一般的蓬勃。</p>
<p>然而，話雖是這樣說，如果我們再退回來想一想，究竟在國貨工業漸决發達的現在，在我們日常的生活用品中，還有不能以國貨工業品來代替的東西嗎？關於這個問題的回答，自然是可以說很多啊！</p>
<p>照相材料，如所用的軟片硬片，以及攝影機及其附帶的用件等，雖不是我們日常每一個人都是必得用到的東西，但就其間接的關係上說，人影的照片，風景的照片，圖書雜誌上的照片等，大多亦與我們每一個人發生關係，或是看到的。現在就看看它的輸入量吧：</p>
<p>據國際貿易局消息，關於照相材料之進口，近來殊見激增，僅軟乾底片及印像紙一項，本年七個月（一月至七月）進口値，達一百零六萬四千七百三十二金單位，折合國幣，的爲二百十二萬九千四百六十四元。其他如攝影器，及各國鏡頭附件等，爲數亦至可觀。</p>
<p>從這樣子的一個統計上看來，確實是要使我們驚駭的。何况以中國新興工業品的種類說來，還沒有照相這一項可以來替代。</p>
<p>聽說這一决全國運動會在上海舉行，光是以照相攝影一項來說，亦有兩家照相社以三千元把他包下來；由此可知照相材料的消耗，一定也是很可驚人的</p>
<p>不過，我希望中國的一般實業家，以及熱心於國貨運動的先進者，能多多的注意及此；想一個方法，擬一個計劃，來創設一爿供給照相材料的廠家。當然，政府當局，也應該要竭力的協助，使這樣大的投資的成功，庶幾不致巨多的金錢，往海外流出去。</p>
<h3>要用國貨紙張</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>與其惜字　不如惜紙</p>
<p>有一天，報上載着江蘇省政府，民政廳和建設廳，近來據中國紙版廠同業聯合會，呈請飭屬取締惜字會；那原因「爲製造紙版原料，字紙亦爲大宗要品」；那大意略說：「在此時代昌明，不應有此迷信觀念，應以字紙賣給工廠，充作造紙原料，在工廠方面，旣可廢物利用，减少舶來原料，在它方亦可藉此易錢，聊補生計，」省府裹，看了該會這個呈子的理由，非常充分，立卽批准；並令「飭各縣一體將原有惜字會，遵令取締，以惜　力而除陋俗」云云；這個辦法，吾以爲十分贊成，什麽緣故呢？因爲「惜字」的本意，前人原在「惜紙」，非但做成一張紙，是不用易的事，要大家實愛；旣經寫有字蹟，那末，必定並非沒有用塲，倘然隨意嘈蹋，和無端去撕破，這就呌「暴殄天物」，問諸良心，亦復何忍；所以最初「惜字」的意思，和「惜紙」的事實，可以說毫無分別，不是兩件事。</p>
<p>譬如數十年前，不但出書，不是便當的一回事，就要造成一刀紙頭，也是很難，因爲機械的利用，還沒有發明，人工手造的東西，不可不愛惜，淺一陛講：家塾裏頭所用的讀本，常常看見有父親讀過的書，雖是很舊，而後來其子尙能作爲讀本，這不是一個明證麽？有一種人不明白「惜字」，就是「惜紙」的道理，纏誤到「惜字」和「科名」發生關係，造出許多荒謬的因果說話來；於是「惜紙」的本意，反而忘掉，表面上呌「惜字」，那結果不管輕重本末，拿了「字」和「紙」，通統付諸一炬，還不够，到了已成灰燼，還要拋入大海裏去，方才以爲功德圓滿，豈非是可嗤可笑的事啊！</p>
<p>你若不信，試到各處的祀廟裹去瞧，不是都有一座「惜字藏」麽？凡慈善家所主持，而使人收得的字紙，時時收入，燒得火燄熊熊，烟氣直騰，所以不特路上看見有携筐擔籮的專收字紙當生活，就是年紀已老，也不惜傴僂俯地，拾了字紙裝入布袋裹，以爲修行的表示；然而拾的儘管去拾，而棄的還自棄着，如要說是「惜字」呢？胆敢講一些也沒有影饗；而且眼前變本加厲，沒有迷信的靑年，以爲字紙旣經遺棄，尙有什麼用，拿字紙來代拭糞穢，滿坑滿谷的也覺得太無意識，因爲他不曉得「惜字」還可，不曉得「惜紙」，實在說不過去；近幾年來，不論那一處學校和機關，滑稽的人們，往往目爲「造字紙的塲所」眞覺不錯，人事愈進，文件愈煩，需用旣多，遺棄也更易，那末，吾以爲値此凡百凋敝，物力已竭的當兒，「字」原來不必去情，而須要知道「紙」萬不可不惜，况有字的棄紙，並非無用。而還價錢，無其白白燒掉，不如積起來，供給製造紙張的去利用，不是好得多多麽？將來所用的紙，不靠着外來的貨品，而吾國自己所　的紙廠，原料有餘，足以供求相濟，唉！不在其他遠大的計畫，而在人人所不注意，和隨便丟掉的字紙上面。</p>
<h3>一幕樂劇</h3>
<p>— 菊侶</p>
<p>在這年頭，生活程度是一天高似一天，人們的物質享受，儘都要最舒適的　以洋貨的淮口，也一年增加一年—終於，整個的國民經濟，瀕於破產地位了！天氣已轉入到初冬，氣候，漸漸的寒冷了起來，當我從辦公處回到家中的時候，看見要正坐在窗口編織叨兒的毛絨外衣，我又想到這毛絨綫，盡是洋貨，會在海關的貿易統計冊上看見過，每年進口數量，値國幣一千多萬元，這也是一個很大的漏巵呢！「又買了洋貨，殘害了自己的生命錢！」當我每决看見妻買洋貨的時侯，我的開口語總是這幾句，接着我正想再婉勸她的時候，妻已笑着立了起來，「你的眼光眞不錯，又是洋貨！」她的說話，老是號樣的，俏皮，隨卽把手中的絨錢團丟給我，「你瞧吧，這是那國的貨物？」我看見商標上面，寫着「皇后牌開司米光絨！」「中國毛絨紡織廠出品，」兩句，我笑了，我把這絨綫很快慰地還給妻，問她「從那裹買來的？」</p>
<p>「天冷了，我想明兒的外衣已破了，咋天到中國國貨公司去看看有什麽可以做的，到了那兒，我最先看到的是絨綫櫃頭，我也想仍舊給他打一伴絨綫的，我於是細心的選擇子：我看見有一種寫着皇后牌開司米光絨，質地非常柔軟，就是最負盛名的老牌洋貨，也望塵吳及，顏色父非常的鮮艷，我就買了一磅半，回到家裏，當卽着手編織，現在已將織好，我記得從前給明兒打的一伴，用老牌洋貨的，實足要一磅半，那知道我這决也買了一磅半，現在却還有一半多餘着，原來是后牌開司米，光絨，份量很輕，所以尺碼長了許多，價錢又不比洋貨貴，眞可以說是價廉物美，國貨中的傑品了，現在你可快活了嗎！」妻計得太興奢了，卽像情一個戰勝了的武士，朝着我凝笑，</p>
<p>「好的，我願你不再買洋貨！」我沒有別的語再可說，其實，我的心中、比她遠耍快樂，在這年頭，國貨紡毛業中，皇后長開司米來光絨，總算是放射了一道異光！</p>
<p>一幕樂劇，就此結束。</p>
<p>兩種新發明</p>
<h3>黃懷英發明「念四印刷版」</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>年來國人對於科學研究之興趣，日見濃厚，因此新發明的物伴，亦日見增多，這可說一方面是我國科學界在積極的進展。一方面是國貨界的前途正未可限量呢。</p>
<p>最近公佈的國人新發明的物件，計潭玉田之直流變交流總壓機，徐伯鋆之人造汽油　尹正衡之新式彈花機等，竟有二十八種之多，這不能算不是一種極好的收穫。但是國入已發明而未經公佈的物件，也正多這呢！本文所談的，黃懷英氏最近發明「念四印刷版」，就是其中之一，現在敢借國貨調刋一角寳貴的篇福，來報吿給熱心提倡國貨的讀者</p>
<p>發叨者黃氏，本是北平印刷界的名人，爲求深造起見，特往日本專攻印刷製版，頗得盛譽。歸國後，卽設製版專門學校於北平，造就專門人才，一，方面仍繼續研究，慘淡經營，歷多决的試騐，終於發明最新式之「念四印刷版」一種。據黃氏云：「余自東瀛歸國後，因感國內印刷用版，分門別類，貴賤懸殊，乃决意加以改良，經五年餘之研究，一百二十七决之實騐，在本年（二十四年）秋季始吿成功。此項印刷版，爲紀念起見，特命名爲「念四印刷版」此版表面不經腐蝕，可用鉛印機印刷，卽精細昂貴之彫刻板，此版亦可代替」。的確，這種印刷版經試用證明，極經濟耐用，所用工料，均係國產，比較鋅銅等版更來得便宜，實爲科學界及國貨零之新發現。聞黃氏於最近期間，將呈請實業部註册專利云。</p>
<h3>藥水電池保安燈之發明</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>南匯有朱鑑林者，出身工業，費年餘的心血，發明了一種藥水電池的保安燈。現在已經試騐成功，該燈經濟簡便，適合現社會的需要，雖在無電燈的鄉村中，亦可應用。日前朱君呈文實業部工業司，並附說明書，圖樣等，請部訂期檢騐，部裹據呈後，卽交專家核議，認爲有試騐的價値，批令朱君卽日隨帶發明品晋京，聽候傳見，以便說明一切，實施檢騐，如能切合實用，當予以若干年限的專利權，藉示獎勵云。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>出版界應把握國民正義</h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>東北淪亡，使我正在發展中的出版界事業，喪失了一個巨大的市場。無疑的，這次冀察兩省的所謂自治運動，對於我不景氣中的出版界，是很大的打擊。但除經濟的打擊外，其給與我國民心理上的影響，實尤值得我們注意。</p>
<p>平津兩地，不僅是我北方，簡直是我全國學術文化的重心，很早，我們就聽到那裏的教科書實是須有改編，以符親善之旨了。當然，以傀儡式的自治運動之出現，這種消滅國民意識的手法，將更有發展。於是我們衰落的出版事業，為了經濟上及政治上的原因，遂惟有放棄其發揚國民文化的使命，而屈伏於暴力之下，因為出版界是反映國民心理的鏡子，故這意義非常重大，表示着民族獨立運動在國民心理上是又遇到了重大的失敗了。</p>
<p>而由這種國民心理上的影響，於是結果所至，是非不分，邪正莫辨，認賊作父以漢奸為殊榮者，　將層見而疊出。若再加以政治上的委曲求全主義，官吏的任用，須視敵人的意旨，使與敵相結者俱得飛黃騰達，到了那個時候，我恐不待敵人的飛機巨炮，我們在心理上已早是亡國之民了。由此次華北事變，一時如亞細亞協會等漢奸團體，竟先後並起，這充分表示其意義的嚴重。而觀察目前的出版界。我們由微知著，如年來的專事翻印古書，而於新知的介紹反不注意，不能不說是一種逃避現實的舉動。我們知道只有英人之於香港，日本之對我東省，才主張讀經，胡說什麽「王道文化。」</p>
<p>故當此之時，我們的出版界，對於民族獨立意識的一線生機之保持，是負有非常重大的　　。我們要認識由國土之日蹙，市場之縮小，我們的出版界是與國家民族同其命運。在強敵侵陵之日前，這是我們民族的災厄，也是我們出版界的受難期。出版家之盡力於民族獨立運動，是不止為的民族，也是所以為自己出版事業的將來。囚之，當目前的危機，我們出版家的唯一要事，我以為應當是「國民正義」的把握。我們只能以此「國民正義」的明燈，才能獨照一般漢奸的陰謀，而為民族的獨立意識吐萬丈光芒。</p>
<p>但是所謂出版家者，此種把握「國民正義」的任務，到底有待於著作家及智識分子，學生青年之共同提携，乃始克奏效。因此，我們學生運動，青年運動以及一切文化運動，思想運動，必然的，與出版界只是一物之兩面。而指摘漢奸叛逆，樹立國民正義的工作，不消說也是我們所有運動中之一種重要項目了。文天祥云：「天地有正氣，於人曰浩然。」這種浩然的正氣之所寄，便是在我們出版家及著作家學生青年的身上的而當民族存亡的危機，則尤須我們能對此有堅強的把握，始能將抽象的國民正義具體化而為統一與獨立的事實。</p>
<h3>學生在救國運動中應有的認識和目標</h3>
<p>— 李建芳</p>
<p>自從北平的學生為擁護國家統一和完整而與反對一切變相的偽自治旗幟之後，連日各地學生也都有同樣的救國表示。據報告所載，廣州學生已實行罷課一星期，杭州的學生更冒着風雪在街上遊行以喚起國民對國家存亡之注意。最近幾天內，上海和武漢國私立各學校的學生爲了援助北平學生，都發出慷慨激昂的宣言——凡此一切表示，是不能不承認這是已死多年的學生運動之復活。</p>
<p>但是，就目前學生所處的環境說，我們對學生實不可太抱樂觀。就目前學生所處的環境說，不管學生運動是怎樣純潔，怎　不帶黨派色彩，更希望學生運動能有大的展開，都是不容易談判的。這裏，第一，是政治的干涉，幾乎是不可能。其次，是國民大眾對於眼前政治反映性之薄弱的組織之渙散，因此，不能不使剛開始的學生運動處於孤軍無援的地位。</p>
<p>不錯，這幾天之內，教育界中也不乏人在和學生做一致表示。然而這只是一時的表面的，而在學生救國運動採取往常形態和組織形態時，腐敗的和官僚化的辦教育的人一定對學生運動感到頭痛的。因此，辦教育的人仍然是學生救國運動阻力之一。</p>
<p>但是，若就學生大眾對眼前歷史有了正確了解和目標說，現在學生運動正未可限量。</p>
<p>學生青年對於眼前歷史第一個應有的認識，就是中國名族之統一運動是今後中國民族生死存亡之關鍵。中國社會的各階級和各個人都須把國家統一當作自己眼前的中心任務，並且應當了解統一是今後一切社會運動之前提。沒有這一前提，真是所謂：「皮之不存，毛將焉附？」</p>
<p>我們要知道，中國在近百年來，是有過許多次亡國滅種之機會的。然中國所以至現在尚未完全亡國者。實由於國際歷史之偶然變化，並非由於國家自己的力量。</p>
<p>中國從鴉片戰後，完全有做印度第二的可能，然而當時沒有成為印度第二者，並非當時的中國比印度亡國時更有抵抗力，乃是因為印度亡國是在商業資本統治時代，而鴉片戰爭時代　在自由主義統治時代。因此，當時的中國只要能允許資本主義各國，特別是英國，自由開　商埠，自由通商，資本主義各國，就已經得到滿足，用不着親自來統治這樣大的國土，所以中國乃　於亡國。這是國際歷史　化之偶然因為第一次救了中國。</p>
<p>中國第二次應當亡國的關頭，是在中日戰後至第二次革命前這個階段。這個階段正是中國民族由歷史的向心力趨於歷史的離心力時代。即軍閥割據之局面由形成而達於最高峯時代。這時候，只要有一支國際強權之魔力伸進到中國來，中國民族不但不能所有任何抵抗力，並且內部的分裂運動會大大的幫助外族的勝利和統治（現在北方自治運動即其顯例）。然而這個這時期，中國仍未亡國者，則不能不歸之於這時期中太平洋列強勢力之均衡。這是國際歷史偶然變化，第二次救了中國。</p>
<p>可是，自九一八事變發生以來，這種在過去曾長時期保障了中國之表面獨立的太平洋的列強均勢已經打破了，並且在英美的對立和歐洲的內部多事之秋，這種均衡勢力之破壞還在有加無已。這就是說，中國現在再得不着國際偶然關係之援助和保障了。然而就在這國際偶然保障關係失去的時候，中國民族自身却先期地發生了一個有一線希望的歷史轉變，這個一線希望的轉變為何？就是中國民族從二次革命以來，又走到一個由離心力運動到向心力運動階段，即由分裂走向統一階段。這雖然是一個尚在進行中的時候，但這一轉變却是中國民族今後免於亡國之保證。所以從這一轉變說，ＸＸ帝國主義此次侵略中國，不僅認中國現在可欺，並且還認中國將來可　。</p>
<p>假如說，ＸＸ帝國主義現在對中國態度有似普法戰爭以前的法國對德的態度，那末，中國對ＸＸ帝國主義的決定，也必然要採取當時的德國對法國的決定。就是說，牠應當由內部的統一運動走到對外族的反攻。因此，內部的統一運動不能不是對外　的反攻之惟一力量和絕對手段。忽視這一決定的人，不管他們是站在甚麼立場說話，在我看來都是與時代不相宜的。</p>
<p>我們的青年學生須認清下一真理：就是一民族內部　是牠自己內部沒有分裂的特殊的利益發展以代替共同利益的發展，那就絕對沒有甚麼力量可以反對這個民族之發展或在牠內部發揮其破壞力。反之，如果特殊的禮儀發展超過共同的利益發展，則外力的侵入只是這種現象的必然結果。因此，反對和打擊目前的特殊利益發展而使國家走向統一之道，這是現在國民之主要任務。</p>
<p>但是要國民起來反對民族中的自私分子和自私集團，首先要國民有政治活動之自由。因此，中國之統一和解放和民主本質地是三位一體。</p>
<p>我們必須之道，真正統一決不是分　式的合作或巨頭們各懷利益的集會。真正的統一　在使階級與階級之間，政府與國民之間，地方與中央之間，權利與義務之間，有一種出自民意的規定和遵守。這種出自民意的規定與遵守，總是國家走上有機發展之惟一保證。</p>
<p>過去數年的學生運動之以消沉無聞者，政治的干涉固是最大的原因，然而學生自身只有黨派的分裂沒有明確的認識和統一的目標，也是學生運動消沉原因之一。因此，今後的學生運動　要是牠不想半途夭折，要是牠不想沒有結果而散，牠非有明確的政治認識和統一目標不可。</p>
<p>有明確的政治認識和統一的目標學生運動就不是簡單的學生運動，它應當是整個民族運動之前鋒。</p>
<h3>書店雜景（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>這並不是給書店的校對員故意吹噓，事實上校對確是須受相當熟練的工作。校對員固然不需要學者專家來充任，但中等以上的學力　　的文字能力，是必須具備的。最好，校對那種書籍的校對員，對於這一門學術有相當的認識，這可對於校對工作更有幫之些。一個盡職的校對員，不但能看清楚原稿，使校稿與原稿無異，而且還要知道原稿上筆誤地方，在相當範圍內，予以校正。</p>
<p>現在各書店中校對員的情形怎樣，因為校對員不及總編輯的有名，所以我們不能個別的申述。不過就一般而言，校對員的地位是很低下的，僅略高於普通店員而已。有的書店甚至不僱佣校對，即由上至總編輯，下至學徒，大家分担校對的責任，因之，一般小編輯與校對員之間，更不容易分別。有的自稱為編輯，事實上不過是個校對員。一般人以為校對接近學術工作，校對的學力容易進步，殊不知即使把某本書校閱了二三次，結果書中說些什麽，校對員也是很難瞭解的（主要原因是工作斷續不定），不過比較　普通的店員，校對員的向上機會，自然要多些。</p>
<h3>保障輿論與出版自由</h3>
<p>— 曾建屏</p>
<p>自從第五屆一中全會周佛海等五十六中委提出　　國府通令全國切實保障正當輿論切實改善檢查新聞辦法以後，根據十一日中央社電訊，國府已於十日訓令直轄各機關，一體遵照，切　保障正當輿論。</p>
<p>自然，這次周佛海等五十六中委之提出保障正當輿論以及國府之執行這一提議並命令恢復大公報之發行，狠明顯的，是政府實踐其　來諾言之重要表現。在這種表現之下，我們希望在不久之後，新聞記者之具體的保障和新聞檢查辦法之改善，能夠切實的實行；不再發生「各地執行，尚欠完善」之弊病，而增加民眾之失望！</p>
<p>雖然，時至今日，保障輿論固是全國一致之要求；但是出版自由這已原則，在目前顯然也是必須兌現的支票。</p>
<p>數年以來，出版界之薄弱無力，以及一般士大夫青年學生之萎　不振，處處均足以表現出中國之未老先衰。這種未老先衰的現象，固然是由於中國一般新舊知識份子之缺乏正確的科學知識，沒有科學的宇宙觀，社會觀及人生觀；但其最主要的一點，確實在於政府之沒有兌現其保障輿論出版界之自由所致。</p>
<p>因為沒有科學的知識，就不能充分認識帝國主義之內部鬥爭以及侵略殖民地之因果關係；沒有認識這種因果關係，就不能獲得一般戰爭形勢之具體的了解；沒有這種具體的了解，所以就不能沉着迎戰，臨危不懼。最近以前一般士大夫之搬家運動，就足以證明這般份子之沒有科學知識。</p>
<p>同時，因為他們之沒有正確的宇宙觀，社會觀及人生觀，所以，遂不能抱着大無畏之精神，抱着與國家民族共同奮鬥的決心。數年以來，一般新舊才子談蛇說鬼，讀經念佛之結果，使大多數青年只知逃避現實，自私自利，無力無用；而不知道如何領導大眾，組織大眾及教育大眾，以為中華民族之生存爭勝負。</p>
<p>現代一般智識份子和學者名流，既然已經完全暴露其清談誤國的現象，而政府當局以及一般地方的武人，又再不能給予出版界以充分的自由；那麼，一般青年思想之被禁錮在黑暗時代，自然更加重了談蛇談鬼之作用以及科學知識之危機。所以，在今日保障輿論　導國民思想之條件下，充分地給予出版界的自由和研究現實知識之自由，實為轉變當前國民思想之主要因素。</p>
<p>因為假使最有影響於一般人民思想之出版界，讀書界，在我們面前這種落後不振的危機中，又不能充分地獲得出版及研究的自由，則其影響所及，將使主持出版界之出版家，只好更在「避兇就吉」的條件下，來大批出版違反時代的御用書籍；而一般以研究力學為我志的青年也只好趨於幽靈的空談，玩物喪志的境地。何況許多落伍的士大夫，又在各地方藉「明德」「講經」以為進身之階；而新式文人又在盲目摸索，把酒玩菊，更造成中國思想界，文化界之黑暗時代！在這種文化思想的黑暗時代之前，誰又有力起來抗敵禦侮呢！</p>
<p>所以，站在整個民族再生的立場上，站在中國文化運動復活的立場上，我們以為要恢復我們民族的自信力之途徑，莫過於充分給予出版界及讀書界以絕對的自由；莫過於禁絕之一切的復古運動及讀經運動之「招搖撞騙」。幾年來提倡保存道德，保存國粹以及崇拜偶像之結果，不僅沒有產生出什麽偉大的文化導師及民族英雄，反之，却反而產生了殷汝耕道班出賣祖國的小醜，產生了上海這班未見敵人先行走路的文化流氓。偉大的（？）岳武穆在那里？可歌可泣的文天祥又在那里？假使沒有這次北平各校學生之首先發起反對自治運動，恐怕過去中華民族的光榮「五四」以來文化運動之光榮，已經完全為上海這班望風而逃的失敗份子所丟盡了！</p>
<p>所以，今日振刷國家保障輿論之另一工作，是開放出版界及讀書界之自由。假如這時候各地方的軍人政客又要繼續禁錮人民的思想，阻止人民之研究自由，那我們相信在目前這一學生運動之再生　浪潮下，不單執政的當局，又要增多一種被要挾的對象；而未來文化的生機，又將連根　喪。故我們希望在今日保障輿論的政策下，出版界以及讀書界之自由，也能獲得充分的解放！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>保障愛國運動</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>在最近各地學生反對華北自治的運動中，我們在報紙上看到他們對政府有一個同樣的要求：「保障愛國運動」。這似乎是各地學生一致的期望。愛國運動，在國家尚未眞的淪亡之前，從國民的立塲來說，自然决非是犯法之事。學校敎材中，有國恥史的列入，並勉勵學生努力救國，政府從前也一再勉勵國民，要長期抵抗。這應該可說，都是屬於愛國運動。政府對於人民的愛國運動，我想政府是應該無不予以保障的。然而現在各地學生却仍要向政府要求保障愛國運動，就備受警察的「不保障」。據報載，學生遊行時，警察整隊趕到，「如臨大敵」，前排者執皮鞭，中排是木板，再後是射水皮管，皮鞭驅逐無效，繼之以木板，木板無效，再繼之以射水。於是，結果學生受傷者有多人。這是已在報紙上說得很清楚的。在同一報紙上，我們又同時看到關於天津少數「好民」受利用而請願自治與成立自治敢死隊等事件的記載，然而警察是和他們「未有衝突」，平安過去。這個對照，使我們看了，實在有此不如彼之感。由此觀之，緊日的有國運動，難免有不受保障的地方，而所謂要求自治也都等等一叛國運動，却倒可以自由自在放手撤去。在這兩個事件比較之下，猶未免使人太覺凄涼了！</p>
<p>無論怎樣說，學生要求保障愛國運動，總是可痛心的事罷，我們無論怎樣去想，愛國　　，總不是有觸法綱的事。今日的「國事」是這樣，祗要我們還有思想，還有求生的　望，目前環境，步步在迫到我們無路可走，這情形實在未免使我們萬分傷心！</p>
<h3>到醫院</h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>妻好久好久就懷孕了。</p>
<p>好的健康已不如從前那樣敎人可喜：精神疲倦，肚育，失眠，……這些，這些，呵……</p>
<p>漸漸的，漸漸的，她是含滿了憂鬱·</p>
<p>愛看書，不愛寫文章。愛聽人家講故事，但自己的故事却壓在心里。這是多麽無聊呵，她有着深深的不可言喻的沉默。</p>
<p>家，也日見陰冷了。</p>
<p>於是，我患着家的沉重病。</p>
<p>因此，家的操勞工作也歸於我：收拾屋子，掃地，生火爐，燒飯，洗衣服，刷馬桶……全要我來擔當，我是不能再耐着心把違些瑣碎不堪的事，交給　被苦惱所抓痛的妻去做了。我覺得我自己滿可以幹得來　，而且幹得很有意思的。譬如說，早先我燒飯，每當我把鍋坐在火爐上，總是小心看着，但沒有幾分鐘的光景，那被火烘焦的發出一種很難　的味，便要從　鍋里騰騰的冒出來。然而現在不唯不能那樣，却保險要燒一口又黏又香的好飯哩。這總是一點小小事情的體驗，但展在人生塲面上的任何一切，又何獨而不然呢？</p>
<p>苦，我是受得起的，但願我有一個</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>坐在檢查室的外屋，在看從家里帶去的一份報紙。等着，等着，就不見妻檢查完，我真有些不耐煩了。天氣這麼冷，在屋子里坐看也是冷顫顫的。好在等到妻出來了，我第一句便這樣問：「怎麼？什麽時候生？」她笑了笑，便：「快了，他說下月呢。」說着，她從腰帶里掏出一張藥單來，這麼說：「走，還得去取藥呢。」我們朝着配藥室走去了。她一邊走一邊說：「醫生說，我頭一次生，必須要驗驗血。」我問她：「那麼你驗了嗎？」她把頭一歪，說：「那哩。他說要驗血，我說好吧，那知他又對我說　，血還要拿兩塊錢，我一想，天哪！這是兩塊錢呀！於是，我對他說我沒有帶錢。他讓我後天，或是大後天再去。」我聽了妻的話沒有說一句話。我心里爬着兩塊錢的影子。</p>
<p>到了配藥室的門口，我們又發怔了。原來那位管着收藥單子的先生跟我們要一塊二毛大洋的藥錢。我偷偷的看了看妻，在她的耳邊輕悄悄的說：「怎辦？腰里只有兩毛大洋。」</p>
<p>妻笑了笑，便對那位先生說：「你先給我藥單子，等我回頭再來。」</p>
<p>黯然的踏出了醫院，我們的心已被一二月的寒風吹冷了。</p>
<h3>化雪之夜</h3>
<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>窗外，風逐着鵝絨般的雪，飛在大地上，在板　間，在屋瓦頂，便露珠那麼地化了。沒有皚白的積雪。</p>
<p>少些新的煤塊，火爐比人還怕冷的時候是有的。因為煊亮的顏色是飽和着多量的冷感呵！</p>
<p>腔腸的火爐，燃着黑亮的煤，冒出薑紅的火燄，清白的煙霧，人自然是摒除孤寂而感受舒適的溫暖了。</p>
<p>但夜視冷濕的，窗外的雪鵝絨般飄着，露珠般化着；我的睡眠是困頓的，而且不禁有冷寞的凄寂，這比化雪的冬夜是有着更可怕的嚴威的。</p>
<p>广幽靈般地撑起身子，　被坐着。害怕冬夜的寂寞，比冬夜的寒冷。</p>
<p>——能怎麼地溫暖着自己呢？</p>
<p>我是個曾經寫過許多雪的消息的人，我把那些消息帶給許多從未見過雪景的朋友；像能夠講地極探險故事的人那麼地對人　誇着。不是嗎，在初見下雪的第一年，我是有着聖誕節情調的魂麗感呢？</p>
<p>（只是沒有曾用雪泥塑成一座人面的立體像，沒曾學過孩子們搏雪球，我還是悵惜着。）</p>
<p>广像這樣的一個夜裏，我用手指塗去蒙在玻璃窗上的一層水氣，從指痕的　隙裏我窺探窗外的雪。</p>
<p>我的鼻尖為着心得好奇，緊緊地壓着窗的玻璃；我的面頰為着過分的奮興，顯得焦紅和乾燥。</p>
<p>於是我便鋪張地告訴我的朋友，那些生活在赤道帶的人們。並且講一個美麗的雪天的故事。</p>
<p>然而這些都是過了時的消息和老舊的故事，為着許多不如意的事遇，我冷靜着，雪帶給我許多寂寞感。</p>
<p>像一個世界的高峯一樣，我的記憶　着三層終年不化的積雪了。在檢查過去的記憶的時候，我害怕着夜的寂寞。比夜的寒冷。</p>
<p>瑰麗的情調是不再屬於我的了，我悄聲地問着自眾：</p>
<p>——能怎麼地溫暖着自己呢？</p>

<h3>新片介紹</h3>
<p>（一）夢殘魂斷</p>
<p>「夢殘魂斷」Peter　Jbbetson，是派拉蒙公司本年度一部至高無上的哀情鉅片。片述一對靑梅竹馬的情侶，不幸長成之後，南北分飛，惟在兩人的心坎裏，却巳留着一個很深的印象·後來雖然重相晤面，但女的不幸已羅敷有夫，因爲職務上的關係，兩個人聚首機會很多，於是愛熖復燃，不可歇止，後來男的因爲誤殺了女的丈夫，被捉將官裏去去，判處徒刑。他們一個在監牢裹，一個在別的所在，但是兩個人的愛情，始終不能泯減，常在夢中相見。這個片子的情節可以算得苦到極點了，主角係賈萊古拍和安哈婷。</p>
<p>（二）唯愛主義</p>
<p>國泰大戲院，因徇各界要求，續映「仲夏夜之夢」三天，下期開映一部華納鉅片「唯愛主義I　ive　For　Love，這是大明星桃樂絲黛莉娥的一部新鉅製，男主角麥賽爾，是紐的舞台上的一位紅伶，成績之美滿，自屬意中事，致於劇中情節，可們祇要看見這個戲名，就可以窺見一班了。久未看見桃樂絲黛利娥的片子的影迷，一定很樂意聽見這個消息吧。看「凱歌」攝影記</p>
<h3>看「凱歌」攝影記</h3>
<p>聽到「凱歌」在拍攝出會一幕偉大塲面的消息，便驅車直到了金司徒廟藝華公司。</p>
<p>嘿！瞧！整個的藝華公司可眞給一般臨時演員把佔滿啦，男女老幼，足足有七八百個人。</p>
<p>這兩天，天氣巳是相常的寒冷了，但他們個個都只穿着一件薄薄的汗衫兒，並且手裏都執着一把扇子兒，不停地在扇着凉，據說是因爲劇情的關係。我拉其中一老者問他冷不冷？他到說因爲太興奮了，所以並不覺得冷。</p>
<p>這話確是屬實，競連我看見那種情狀，也已感覺到了絕大的興奮啦！瞧！隨風索索地飄揚在滿攝影塲上的近千把數的旗幟，長可五六丈的三條靑龍，他如虎，豹，獅，象，麟，大鼓陣，絲竹班，蹺高脚，三本鐵公鷄，打漁殺家等的玩意兒，還有……總而言之；熱鬧之狀，確非筆墨所能形容。</p>
<p>整個攝影塲又全塔着此出會用的佈景，灣灣曲曲，幾把藝華公司改換了另一個面目。假使你不知道它是一家影片公司，包你走走進去會大吃一驚，此地何來這麼一個大村落，而今天是爲着什麼事這般熟鬧。</p>
<p>走過去跟老下握個手，知此出會塲面已改換了三幕佈景，今天是最後的一天，晚上還得拍到天亮，並且晚上的戲大家又需要赤裸。他說：「大家都肯聽話，願跟我們苦幹到底。」最後他又很感慨地說：「藝人們的生活並不是舒服的啊！」</p>
<p>我站立在不妨礙他們工作的地方，一直到了太陽落西山，他們暫停工作的時候，猶戀戀不捨地抱着一顆熱烈的情緒不肯離去。</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council: First General Meeting Elects Three Standing Committee Members, Song Zheyuan Announces Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Beiping: The Hebei-Chahar Political Council held its inauguration ceremony at the Foreign Affairs Building this morning at 8 a.m. Preparations were extremely thorough, with Kuomintang flags crossed at both the main and secondary gates, and tight security provided by military police and constabulary. Attendees included Chairman Song Zheyuan, and council members Wan Fulin, Wang Yitang, Liu Zhe, Li Tingyu, Jia Deyao, Hu Yukun, Gao Lingwei, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Men Zhizhong, Shi Jingting, Leng Jiaji, a total of fourteen people. Zhou Zuomin was in Shanghai, Wang Kemin resigned, and Cheng Ke was absent due to illness. Guests included Bao Wenwei, He Yingqin's representative Yan Kuan, the cabinet's representative Guan Yingkai, Han Fuqu's representative Cheng Xixian, Ma Hongkui's representative Bai Qilin, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Beiping Cheng Xigeng, and more than eighty others from the 29th Army, etc. The meeting began promptly. The main hall was located in the large living room on the east building's upper floor, with the Kuomintang flag hung in the center. Formalities were observed, music played, Chairman Song Zheyuan delivered a speech, Council Member Li Tingyu delivered a speech, and Chairman Zou Quansun of the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech. A photograph was taken to mark the occasion, and the council members proceeded to dine. The first general meeting then commenced, resolving: 1. To hold a general meeting every Friday at 4 p.m.; 2. To elect Wang Yitang, Qin Dechun, and Liu Zhe as standing committee members, responsible for handling the council's daily affairs. The meeting concluded at approximately 12 p.m. The council's inauguration meeting was attentive to the guests. Over thirty reporters from Chinese, Japanese, European, and American media outlets were present to cover the event. Song specially prepared lunch to host them, and renowned photographers Hawkes and Northwest Photography Studio were on-site to film the proceedings. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan delivered a speech at this morning's inaugural meeting, stating: "The Central Government, for the sake of administrative convenience, has specially established the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to handle all political affairs of Hebei and Chahar provinces and the two municipalities of Beiping and Tianjin. Regarding future domestic and foreign policies, the first principle is that all future local reforms, personnel appointments, and administration shall be based on public opinion; we shall embrace what the people embrace and reject what the people reject, and shall never act against the will of the people. Secondly, those in government should share the joys and sorrows of the people. Regarding financial matters, we should strictly enforce integrity and earnestly rectify the situation. In this time of financial stringency, we must ensure that the economies of Hebei and Chahar provinces gradually stabilize. Thirdly, we should uphold the principle of good neighborliness and strive for amity in international relations. All who treat us with the spirit of equality and mutual benefit are our friends. Moreover, since the Tanggu Truce, Hebei and Chahar provinces have had a special relationship with Japan. For the sake of the interests of both countries and the peace of East Asia, we should mutually support and assist each other in implementing genuine friendship. Zheyuan is willing to make the utmost sincerity and final effort. In addition, respecting etiquette and morality, eliminating the scourge of communism, promoting the spirit of Eastern culture, and promoting the people's ability to self-govern are also what Zheyuan has always advocated. As the ancients said, 'Governing is not about much talk.'

<h3>"A Farce in North China": Commentary from the London Times</h3>
<p>London: The Times today published an editorial, stating that the drama in North China has closed another act, but it is very different from the previous acts, making the audience quite confused. The characters who are determined to take the stage are the Japanese militarists, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel who joined hands with the militarists, the various things created by the militarists, and the Chinese autonomous factions who play minor roles. The audience of the great powers are either silent or murmuring grievances. However, there has been an important change, that is, the Nanjing government does not yield but resists pressure, and is able to escape danger with better conditions than expected. The problem has now been resolved through a compromise. The compromise, of course, strengthens Japan's position in North China, but not as much as the Japanese military authorities hoped. The organizational elements of the new government of Nanjing can be seen that the new government can cooperate with Japan, but only if the Japanese militarists no longer deviate from it with intimidating actions. The final goal of the Japanese in North China has not yet been determined, but more important than speculation on this issue is the attitude of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its spokesperson has criticized the Nine-Power Treaty that maintains the territorial and administrative integrity of China. What is obvious is that the Japanese government must have a bargaining plan in mind. When the difference between the US naval policy and Japanese demands becomes clear, we should hear more about the issue. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Returns to Post: Immediately Visits Japanese Foreign Ministry to Exchange Information on China Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry official, Shigemitsu, on the afternoon of the 17th to report on his inspection of China and exchange information on issues such as China's currency system and the North China issue.

<h3>Students in Nanjing Petition at the Executive Yuan: 5,000-Strong March Maintains Strict Order, Representatives from Various Schools Present Several Demands, Weng Wenhao Meets and Provides Satisfactory Response</h3>
<p>Nanjing: After the student movement in Beiping was launched, representatives were sent to Nanjing to explain the progress of the Beiping student movement to students from various schools. The students in Nanjing expressed deep sympathy and invited representatives from various schools to gather at the student dormitory of Central University on the night of the 17th to decide to suspend classes and petition on the 18th. Central University President Luo Jialun and Central Party Headquarters Secretary-General Ji Chucang explained the current situation of the central government to the student representatives late at night on the 17th and tried to persuade them that there was no need to suspend classes and petition. On the morning of the 18th, the representatives from various schools still held a meeting at Central University, deciding to gather all the university and middle school students in the city in the afternoon to petition the National Government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, demanding (1) the release of arrested students in Beiping and compensation for medical expenses for the injured; (2) protection of students' patriotic movements. At 3 p.m. on the 18th, all the students of Jinling Women's College of Law and Politics, Capital Women's High School, and Central University gathered at the playground of Central University, and elected Li Zhaoduan, Liu Haitu, Liu Borang, Ding Xurong, and Yang Bojing of Central University as the presidium to explain the purpose of the petition to all the students, saying that it was only to contribute opinions to the government and there was no hostile behavior, and that order must be strictly observed. It was decided to go to the Executive Yuan first, then to the National Government, and finally to the Ministry of Education. The large contingent set off in formation at 3:30 p.m. On the way, they met students from Dongfang Middle School, and before arriving at the Executive Yuan's playground, students from Anhui Middle School, Zhongying Middle School, Zhongnan Middle School, etc., also rushed to participate, with a total of more than 5,000 people. They shouted slogans along the way, and at about 4 p.m., they gathered in formation in front of the Executive Yuan's playground. Fifty representatives were elected, led by the presidium of Li Zhaoduan and other five people. Under the guidance of the special service team, they entered the courtyard. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao came out to meet them. All the representatives were in the auditorium, and the remaining 5,000 students were lined up on the playground in front of the courtyard, with strict order. After the delegation entered the auditorium, the student representatives first explained the purpose of the Nanjing students' petition. Weng answered them one by one, saying, "After the student movement in Beiping occurred, the Executive Yuan immediately telegraphed Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun to handle it peacefully and immediately release the arrested students. As for the medical expenses of the injured, it is not a problem. Since you have this request, I will re-telegram Qin to investigate the truth. If there are any injured, order the local administrative authorities to be responsible for treatment. Student patriotic movements should be protected as long as they do not overstep the line. Finally, Weng also said, "The current government is definitely not comparable to the previous Beijing government. Students' petitions can only be applied to governments in the era of stubbornness. It is a pity that you are wasting your studies to do this today. Please convey this to all the classmates. I am unable to meet all the classmates in person due to business matters, which I deeply regret," etc. At more than 5 p.m., the student delegation of more than 50 people left the Executive Yuan and reported Weng's intentions to the public. All the students considered it satisfactory, and in the twilight, they marched in formation, passing through Guofu West Street to Taiping Road, and then turning from Baixia Road into Zhongzheng Road, and returning to Central University. It was heard that after the march, the representatives still gathered at Central University to discuss the issue of classes. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

As for the student's patriotic movement, it is hoped that the principals will quickly use strict management methods to earnestly persuade them to abide by order. The principals said that the matter came suddenly and they could not persuade them in time. When the students petitioned the Executive Yuan in the afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to persuade the students to return to school. The Capital Garrison Headquarters and the Police Department also temporarily dispatched a large number of military police to maintain order, and prohibited irrelevant people and all vehicles from passing when they gathered at the Executive Yuan.

<h3>The United States Will Revise the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>For several days. There have been widespread reports in the United States that President Roosevelt will propose an amendment to the Neutrality Act. Next January, when Congress convenes, this bill will be the focus of discussion. The President has taken this action because he deeply understands that the current Neutrality Act cannot enable the United States to cope with the serious international environment. If a war in the Far East begins, the United States' neutrality under the law will inevitably lead the country into an unprecedented crisis from which it cannot extricate itself. The Act stipulates that once a war breaks out between any countries, the United States will immediately declare neutrality, prohibit the export of munitions to belligerent countries, and announce that the government will not protect its citizens traveling in war zones. These provisions are only enough to embolden the aggressive countries in the Far East and restrict the United States' freedom of action in the Far East.</p>
<p>The original intention of the Neutrality Act was to enable the United States to avoid joining a war in Europe. Therefore, it is based on the experience of the First World War. However, the United States' ideal enemy is no longer in Europe, but in the Far East. When the Naval Conference opened, the United States discovered a plan by Japan to bomb American cities. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Pittman, even referred to a certain country in the Far East as a bandit. The concern of the American people and government for East Asia and their hatred for aggressors are evident. If the current Neutrality Act is not amended, it means that if these aggressive countries go to war with any country, the United States will not only not provide any military supplies to the invaded country, but can still continuously transport cotton, kerosene, copper, iron, and the like to the aggressive country, which is contrary to American national policy and harmful to world peace.</p>
<p>Moreover, the content of the Neutrality Act is also incomplete. For example, in wartime trade, it is limited to munitions only. According to Roosevelt's intention, to make trade restrictions effective, the prohibition of exports must extend to kerosene, cotton, iron, and the like. The previous involvement of the United States in the Great War was not only prompted by arms merchants, but also by exporters of agricultural and industrial products. The original Act does not prohibit extending credit or loans to belligerent countries, nor does it restrict propaganda in the United States. All of these points will be discussed by the next Congress. The most important question to be discussed is whether the United States treats aggressive countries the same way and whether the government imposes appropriate sanctions on those who undermine international peace and damage international treaties. Judging from Secretary of State Hull's statement on the North China issue a few days ago, the United States still attaches great importance to collective peace and international sanctions.</p>
<p>Now the Naval Conference is showing a waning trend. Diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States have reached an unprecedented crisis. The year 1936 is approaching. The United States has already made active military preparations, but has not yet made much diplomatic preparation. The purpose of proposing an amendment to the Neutrality Act may be this.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Hosts Chinese and Foreign Reporters and Announces Foreign Policy; Seeks to Adjust International Relations with Sincerity and Trust; Lifts Unequal Obligations through Legal Channels; Receives Envoys from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The new Foreign Minister Zhang Qun hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 18th and delivered the following written statement: "I am a revolutionary soldier. In the revolutionary process of the past twenty-five years, whether in military or internal affairs, I have served the country, and my loyalty has remained unwavering. Although diplomacy is not my forte, I am willing to do my best to improve relations with other countries and promote international friendship. The foreign policy of the National Government is to seek an independent and equal position for China itself, and to seek lasting peace in the international community. This policy remains unchanged. In any environment, we must continue to strive towards this goal. Premier Chiang's explanation of China's current foreign policy at the Fifth National Congress last month was particularly clear. China is determined to seek political coordination with friendly countries to the extent that it does not infringe on sovereignty, to seek economic cooperation with friendly countries based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, and to be determined to make the ultimate sacrifice and make the greatest efforts for peace in order to achieve the goal of laying the foundation for national revival. The world knows that all special treaty-based obligations of China are outdated and hinder China's development. Our greatest hope is to find a way to lift these special obligations through legal channels. But we firmly believe that the primary obligation between nations is to establish trust. China's way of governing the country for thousands of years lies in trust. Under today's circumstances, it is particularly dependent on trust. We are well aware that we are bound by various unequal obligations, but all legitimate obligations, even if unreasonable, must still be patiently observed based on trust before they are lifted. At the same time, we also hope that all relevant countries will recognize China's current status and its reasonable demands, trust international law, and trust the various measures taken by the Chinese government, which only seek China's self-preservation and coexistence with other countries. Mutual trust between nations is the most solid foundation for international peace, and mutual trust between nations depends on the sincerity of the rulers of each country. In the future, the Chinese government will continue to treat any foreign country, especially those with the closest relations, with the utmost sincerity to seek the adjustment of international relations and the renewal of the international situation. We firmly believe that the gains from this policy will not only benefit China, but will also be of no small benefit to the foreign countries concerned."

<h3>Three Thousand Elite Abyssinian Troops Cross River at Night to Attack Italian Positions; Italian Troops Panicked, Retreated Twelve Miles; Most Important Battle Since the Start of the War</h3>
<p>Rome – According to today's official war report, Abyssinian troops attacked and defeated Italian troops in the Teggazi area. Italian troops in the northern sector urgently dispatched tanks and aircraft to counterattack the Abyssinian troops today, and the fighting between the two sides was fierce. This may be the start of the long-awaited Abyssinian general offensive. The Italian side suffered four officer and nine soldier casualties. In addition, dozens of Ascari soldiers were also killed or wounded. The Italian troops have now retreated to the Dembeguina Pass, twelve kilometers behind the front lines, to reorganize their defenses. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to today's war report, three thousand elite Abyssinian troops have repelled the outposts of the Italian troops in the northern sector. The battle is still in progress. Dozens of Eritrean soldiers were killed or wounded, and three white officers were also injured. This battle is said to be one of the most important since the start of the war. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Asmara – The Italo-Abyssinian war, which has been mostly a diplomatic affair for several weeks, turned into a real decisive battle yesterday. Three thousand Abyssinian troops attacked an Italian detachment in the area of the Teggazi River in the northern sector and drove them away. This victory has been acknowledged by the Roman gazette. The Abyssinian troops, under cover of dense clouds and a hazy moon, waded across the Teggazi River at 2:00 AM and attacked the Italian positions on the right bank. At 2:00 AM, a message reached the Italian Second Army Corps' sentry post. The Italian soldiers, caught completely by surprise, responded in a panic. The Abyssinian advance was temporarily halted by machine gun fire. However, the main force of the Abyssinian troops made every effort to openly cross the river in order to attract Italian bombardment and divert Italian attention from the actions of other Abyssinian troops in the fire zone. Before long, the Italian troops abandoned their forward defenses and held on to their rear defenses. But by 6:00 AM, the Italian troops were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated to the Danbeguina Pass, more than ten miles northeast of the starting point of the battle. The Italian troops have established strong defenses here and are said to have inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing Abyssinian troops. The second act of this great battle lasted until the afternoon. At the same time, the large Abyssinian army commanded by General Buru crossed the river sixty miles downstream, threatening the Italian flank and penetrating deep into the territories of Shiré and Adigrat, aiming to intimidate the local population who had submitted to the Italians. Italian aircraft and small tanks attacked the Abyssinian troops, but the Abyssinian troops continued to advance until they stopped yesterday afternoon. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The Times today published an editorial stating that the truth of the Abyssinian war situation is whether we have reason to resolve it with the British-French peace plan. It is now very difficult to believe that the war situation is favorable to the Italian troops, as they are far from what they had ideally hoped to achieve when planning the war. After ten weeks of bitter fighting, the Italian troops have made very little progress towards resolving the issues. The limited achievements so far have greatly reduced the hope of resolving the war situation before the rainy season. The Italian troops in the northern sector have not yet reached the point reached by a small number of Italian troops in 1895. The only victory in the southern sector is at Gorrahei, and there is little else to mention. There is now much evidence that the Italian troops are suffering greatly from transporting large quantities of military supplies along poor roads. Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio has apparently changed his strategy and intensified aerial attacks. However, when continuing the offensive in the future, will they gradually expand the occupied territory and increase the difficulty of attacking? When both seasons arrive, the difficulties for the Italian troops will inevitably increase several times compared to now, which is something that all countries should not ignore.

<p>Rome – It is rumored that Pope Pius XI will request a ceasefire between Italy and Abyssinia during the Christmas holidays. Previously, when Paraguay and Bolivia were at war over the Gran Chaco, the Pope made the same request to each of those countries. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>World's Eyes Focused on Geneva; League of Nations Administrative Council Meets; British Representative Eden to Explain Stance; Peace Proposal Left to Free Judgment</h3>
<p>Geneva – The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting at 11:15 AM. The chairman was Argentine representative Ganaqi. All council members were present except for Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who was scheduled to arrive at noon, and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, who was represented by the country's ambassador to France, Potemkin. (The Italian government did not send a representative to attend.) According to the agenda, the first item discussed was the settlement of Assyrian refugees. After the meeting, the council members exchanged views on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in the office of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. After British Minister Without Portfolio Eden arrived here yesterday, he requested that the Administrative Council continue to hold an open meeting this afternoon so that he could deliver a speech on behalf of the British government. The public is extremely concerned about Eden's speech. Eden will clearly explain the British government's attitude towards the solutions proposed by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval. It is said that it will be left to the Administrative Council for free judgment and free disposal. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Geneva – Eden and Laval arrived here this morning. Sterling is among the members of the British delegation. He is the head of the Oil Affairs Section of the British Board of Trade. This is quite relevant, indicating the possibility of discussing the oil embargo. It is widely believed that Eden will follow the same path established by the Committee of Eighteen last week, namely that the British-French peace proposal is not immutable and can be criticized and modified. Even if it is rejected, it does not matter. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Geneva – The representatives of various countries who attended this afternoon's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting had discussions with each other this morning. As a result, it is widely believed that the British-French peace proposal is dead. According to the League of Nations, the only question now is how to dispose of the remains of this proposal. It is expected that today's open Administrative Council meeting will be brief. After the meeting, a Committee of Thirteen will be formed immediately, without the participation of either Italy or Abyssinia. It is also expected that the Administrative Council will hold a closed-door meeting tonight to discuss what steps should be taken to intensify and increase sanctions against Italy. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Geneva – Strategists in the leading national delegations at the State Administrative Council meeting on Wednesday have planned to postpone the discussion of the British-French peace proposals until Friday, pending Thursday's debate in the British House of Commons. (National News Agency Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Geneva – Public attention to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is focused on Geneva today, as the League of Nations Administrative Council will meet to consider the British-French peace proposal and the issue of an oil embargo against Italy. British representative Eden will explain the British position, so all eyes are on Eden. It is widely expected that Eden will reiterate that this kind of peace proposal is not intended to be imposed on anyone, but is merely presented as a basis for discussion. He does not want to promote it unless it is accepted by the League of Nations. Eden will also reiterate Britain's willingness to participate in any collective action decided by the League of Nations. If this peace proposal is overturned and the Committee of Eighteen re-raises the issue of an oil embargo, then the issue of collective responsibility for any incidents that may arise from the implementation of the oil embargo will certainly become an active topic of discussion for the League of Nations. It is rumored that the peace proposal contains a clause that if the port of Assab is ceded to Abyssinia, then Abyssinia may not build a railway along the narrow strip of land leading to the coast. It is now understood that this statement is actually a misunderstanding. If the port of Zeila is ceded to Abyssinia, then there may be such a regulation regarding the narrow strip of land leading to Zeila. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Italy Did Not Send a Representative to Attend</p>
<p>Geneva – When the League of Nations Administrative Council met this morning, the Italian government did not appoint a representative to attend. According to members of the Italian delegation, the Italian Fascist Party's Supreme Council is scheduled to meet tonight and will naturally make a decision regarding the solutions to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute proposed by Britain and France. The Italian delegation was unable to attend the Administrative Council meeting beforehand. In addition, Italian sources said that since the implementation of sanctions by various countries on the 18th of last month, Italy has not sent representatives to participate in any meetings of the League of Nations that are political in nature. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia's Reply Expresses Rejection</p>
<p>Geneva – The formal reply of the Abyssinian Emperor to the peace proposals made by Britain and France was delivered to the Secretariat of the League of Nations at 12:00 noon by the Abyssinian Minister to France, Gedda Warad. It is generally believed that its content criticizes the plan proposed by Britain and France, saying that it is neither fair nor in accordance with the principles of international law, but it does not explicitly reject it. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Mussolini's Animated Speech</p>
<p>Rome – Mussolini declared in a speech today Italy's determination to resist sanctions and implement its aspirations in East Africa. "We are now dealing with self-interest and hypocrisy. This will be a difficult struggle, but we will fight to the end. We have a determination to win. Time may be extended, but what we value is victory, not time." Mussolini went on to mention the British-French peace proposal, saying that Italy does not want to send its people to remote and uncivilized places unless those places are under Italian protection. Later, he mentioned the sanctions imposed by the League of Nations, saying that the Italian people have a clear conscience, are in a just position, and should be able to resist them for a long time.

<h3>Fascist Party Supreme Administrative Council Met Last Night to Decide Future Attitude</h3>
<p>Rome – The Fascist Supreme Administrative Council will meet at 10:00 PM tonight to discuss the British-French peace proposal. At that time, Mussolini will report his opinions on the proposal. The Supreme Administrative Council will postpone its meeting for a few days before making a decision. However, if there is a resolution, a communique may be issued in the middle of the night, explaining the Italian attitude that the world is eager to hear. The Italian government has requested clarification on several points in the British-French proposal. It is widely expected that after receiving clarification, Mussolini will notify Britain and France, informing them of the points that Italy cannot agree to. It is expected that what Italy cannot agree to includes ceding the port of Assab and a narrow strip of land to Abyssinia, Abyssinia retaining the holy city of Aksum, Italy's request to extend the area of Abyssinia colonized by Italy to the Sudanese border, and Italy enjoying special economic privileges in Harar Province. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" today published an anonymous article, probably written by Mussolini, which stated that the Fascist Supreme Administrative Council may discuss the old Europe at its meeting tonight. It continued, "Italy can never be overwhelmed by an imperialist encirclement organized with the support of fifty nations. The Italian people are filled with righteous indignation towards their adversaries and will resist with all their might the imperialists who attempt to prevent our workers from occupying a place in the light of day, and the conspiracy of dark red and green parties to influence Italy's destiny. The old and discordant Europe has neither the strength nor the moral power to overwhelm this nation." (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Wedding Rings Dedicated to the Nation</h3>
<p>Solemn Ceremony Held in Front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier; National Women Take the Lead in Actively Resisting Sanctions</p>
<p>Rome – Today is the thirty-first day of the implementation of sanctions against Italy by various countries. Memorial ceremonies were held throughout the country. At the same time, people across the country presented their gold wedding rings to the nation. In Rome, the Queen took the lead. At 8:40 this morning, amidst enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, the Queen drove to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, ascended the altar, and placed her two wedding rings, given when she married King Victor Emmanuel III, into a tripod placed on the altar. Although it was raining heavily at the time, the entire scene was solemn as the Queen's broadcast address to the nation was respectfully listened to. The gist of the address was to ask the people of the country to sacrifice for the country so that Roman civilization could achieve its final victory. After the speech, the wife of General Puglia, a famous general who died in the European War, presented the Queen with a steel wedding ring. The Queen then returned to the palace from the altar, after which thousands of common people formed a line to ascend the altar and place their wedding rings into the tripod.

<h3>British and French Political Turmoil Avoided; British Cabinet Understands Hoare's Position; Laval Gains Confidence of French Parliament</h3>
<p>London – It was heard today that the cabinet has decided that Foreign Secretary Hoare does not need to resign, nor will Minister Without Portfolio Eden be made to resign. Eden has now been given the power to act freely in attending the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. Therefore, Eden will probably state again cautiously that the British-French peace proposal is not something sacred and inviolable, and that Britain does not insist that the League of Nations must pass it. Internal opposition in France has also forced Prime Minister Laval to take the same attitude. Therefore, in the opinion of well-informed observers here, the rejection of the British-French proposal in Geneva seems inevitable. Today, Hoare was unable to attend the cabinet meeting due to illness, so other cabinet members were free to discuss whether to sacrifice Hoare to quell opposition. It is reported that Eden today strongly urged the government to reveal the truth during Thursday's debate in the House of Commons, but he also understood Hoare's position. It was because of fear that expanding sanctions would lead to war that he proposed peace negotiations, and the situation has therefore calmed down slightly. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>London – After this morning's cabinet meeting, political turmoil has been avoided. It is reported that the cabinet has decided to instruct Minister Without Portfolio Eden to declare to the League of Nations Administrative Council that any proposals regarding the Italo-Abyssinian armistice should be left to the League of Nations to decide, and that the dangers that may arise from the implementation of sanctions should also be shared by all member states of the League of Nations. In addition, when Foreign Secretary Hoare makes a statement in the House of Commons on Thursday, he will not apologize for the plan proposed by Britain and France, but will frankly explain the reasons for accepting it. (Havas Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>London – In the House of Commons today, Prime Minister Baldwin was questioned as to why the British fleet was concentrated in Alexandria. Baldwin replied that the fleet was originally stationed in Malta and was quite close to the Italian east coast. Now, because Italian newspapers have attacked Britain and British warships are patrolling near Italian territorial waters, it is not appropriate, so the patrol area is limited to a corner of the Mediterranean, and Alexandria is the only port where they can dock. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – After a heated debate in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon on the British-French peace proposal, Prime Minister Laval spoke eloquently, defending the proposal. He concluded by saying that if the opposition party criticized the proposal and tried to bind him with humiliating terms, he would not be willing to go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations meeting and therefore requested a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies before proceeding. When put to a vote, the government won a great victory with a majority of fifty-four votes. (Reuters Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Chamber of Deputies continued its discussion of the Foreign Ministry's budget proposal at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Orthodox Socialist leader Léon Blum gave a speech, saying that Prime Minister Laval's policy on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute should be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion so that it can express its approval or doubts. As far as I know, even the cabinet itself is not unanimous on foreign policy. Then, former Aviation Minister Cote, a member of the Radical Socialist Party, rose to speak, saying that Prime Minister Laval had failed to seize the opportunity in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and establish a good precedent in jurisprudence based on the collective security system. France may need this kind of good precedent in the future, so it should be planned for in advance. He also said, "The solutions to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute proposed by Britain and France use the method of dividing Abyssinia to satisfy the desires of the aggressor country. If the French Parliament can discuss it as soon as possible and at length, most members will express their opposition and veto it. We certainly approve of ending the war with a policy of reconciliation, but we are not happy to have this policy forced on others by force. What we seek is to obtain a solution whose spirit is in line with the League of Nations Covenant." Communist Party member Beri then rose to speak, strongly attacking the solutions proposed by Britain and France. As for Central Party member Herriot, he supported Laval's current policy and said that the plans proposed by Britain and France do not force others to accept them. They must be implemented only if the League of Nations and both parties involved in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute accept them. At this point, Prime Minister Laval then issued a declaration, saying, "The policy I have pursued in Geneva has been explained to the Chamber of Deputies this morning. There is no other policy. If you think it is dangerous, you must have the courage to express your opinion immediately." The Prime Minister then immediately proposed a vote of confidence, and the Chamber of Deputies immediately expressed its confidence. (Havas Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Christmas; British Monarch to Make Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>London – The British monarch will deliver a broadcast address to his people on Christmas Day as is the custom every year. The time will be 3:00 PM (11:00 PM Shanghai time). After the monarch's address, the British national anthem will be sung throughout Britain. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Anti-War, Anti-Italian Demonstration in New Jersey</h3>
<p>New Jersey – Today, many people gathered here to hold a demonstration, carrying anti-war and anti-fascist leaflets, opposing the transportation of war materials to Italy. They marched in formation to the waterfront. A Norwegian cargo ship, the "Spero," was docked at the pier, loading scrap iron in preparation for going to Italy. The demonstrators intended to board the ship to protest to the captain, but the police had already rushed to the scene and prevented them from boarding. The leader of the demonstrators then stood on a cargo box and gave a loud speech, opposing the transportation of war materials to Italy, and nineteen of the "Spero's" sailors even joined the demonstration. The police ordered the demonstrators to disperse, and eight people were arrested for disobeying police orders. (Reuters Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>New Czech President; Beneš Elected; Followed Masaryk in the National Revival Movement; Internationally Renowned for His Diplomatic Skills</h3>
<p>Czech Capital – The National Assembly, jointly composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, held a presidential election in the Prague Palace in Wlašimoz today. The results have been announced. Foreign Minister Beneš was elected as the fifth President of the Czech Republic with 340 votes against 79 votes. Twenty-four votes were abstained. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Prague – After being elected President, Beneš entered the Congress Hall at 12:10 PM. Members of parliament came forward to congratulate him. Beneš immediately took an oath, willing to do his best to uphold the Constitution of the Republic. Afterwards, Prime Minister Hodža submitted his resignation to the new President as usual. It is generally believed that the resigning cabinet will certainly be re-appointed to form a cabinet this afternoon. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>New Czech President Beneš</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Beneš</h3>
<p>The new President Beneš is currently 51 years old and comes from a farming family. During his time at the local university, he majored in philosophy and linguistics. At that time, former President Masaryk was teaching sociology at the university. Beneš listened to his lectures morning and evening and benefited greatly. In August 1905, Beneš, on the advice of Masaryk, went to Paris to study and also wrote and sent dispatches to the Prague socialist newspaper to make a living. In 1906, he began drafting his doctoral dissertation, entitled "The Austrian Problem and the Czech," the purpose of which was to elaborate on the independence of the Czech people from the aspects of race, language, and society. Beneš studied in Paris for three years, and in September 1908, he returned to Prague and became a professor of economics at the Commercial College. At that time, he had formally joined the Progressive Party led by Masaryk. In 1914, when the European War broke out, Beneš and Masaryk formulated a plan for the national revival movement, deciding that Masaryk would travel abroad and Beneš would stay in the country to communicate with Masaryk at any time. It was not until September 1915 that Beneš went to Paris via Switzerland and began lobbying the Allied countries for the Czech national revival issue. In 1916, his book "Destroying the Austro-Hungarian Empire" was published. In October 1918, Masaryk organized the "Czech Provisional Government," and Beneš served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. At the time of the end of the European War, he participated in the peace conference as the Czech Foreign Minister and did not return to his country until September 1919. Since then, Beneš has never changed his position as Foreign Minister. Since the Czech Republic's restoration, the country's foreign affairs have been planned by Beneš. In 1920, he signed agreements with Yugoslavia and Romania, which were the precursors to the establishment of the Little Entente. In the same year, Beneš attended the League of Nations General Assembly and was elected Vice-Chairman. In 1923, the Czech Republic was elected as a member of the Administrative Council, and Beneš also served as a member. In 1924, Beneš signed the Franco-Czech alliance treaty with the French government. In 1932, he formally concluded the Little Entente Agreement with Yugoslavia and Romania. In May of the same year, he signed a mutual assistance treaty with Soviet Russia, only a few days before France and Russia signed a mutual assistance pact. In September, when the League of Nations General Assembly met, Beneš was elected Chairman of the General Assembly by representatives of the member states. Forty-four of the fifty-one member states present voted in favor, which also shows a glimpse of his popularity. Recently, former President Masaryk retired due to old age and fatigue. When resigning, he recommended Beneš to the country. Beneš had followed Masaryk for many years and devoted himself to the national revival movement. His achievements have long been admired by the country. Therefore, his election was by no means accidental. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Naval Conference: Nature of British Proposal - Safety and Equality as Treaty Principles - US to Propose "Escalator Clause"</h3>
<p>London - Today's naval conference opened with British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell proposing that each country's representative declare the maximum tonnage of warships they plan to build in the coming years. The actual nature of tonnage allocation was not specified; however, the tonnage of each of the five major categories should be reported. This proposal includes the idea that any treaty reached in the future should contain a clause recognizing the safety and equality of each signatory nation and allowing for military preparedness plans necessary for national security. The treaty will not contain specific figures, but a unilateral declaration containing total tonnage will be attached to the treaty as a slightly less formal undertaking, so as not to sacrifice the position of any country by agreeing to build lower tonnage than others. How to make the attached document a binding obligation depends entirely on the support of each country for the British proposal. It is reported that the US representative is making every effort to ensure that the attached document has real binding power. It is expected that the US representative will propose an "escalator clause" aimed at maintaining the current ratio. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The Naval Conference's General Committee convened this afternoon at 3:00 PM in Clarence House. The British chief delegate, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Monsell, will explain the British-proposed "quantitative limitation" plan. US chief delegate Norman Davis, Japan's Nagano, and experts from various national delegations were all in attendance. The General Committee is scheduled to meet again at 10:30 AM on Thursday. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The British proposal aims to maintain the current ratio, so the United States has stated that it will not object. France and Italy have also stated that they could support it if the period of halting warship construction is shortened. Therefore, only Japan is strongly opposed. (Dentsu, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hegemony in the Pacific: Japan-US Talks Unfruitful</h3>
<p>London - Nagano and Nagai, as plenipotentiaries, accompanied by three staff members, visited the US delegation on the morning of the 17th to exchange views with US representatives Davis, Stanley, and Philip on the issue of a common maximum limit. However, the US side insisted on its consistent position and the talks ended without results. (Domei, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Nagano, the chief Japanese delegate to the Naval Conference, today explained to Davis, the chief US delegate, the reasons why Japan could not accept the US naval proposal. Japanese and US representatives held a closed-door meeting today. Nagano stated that because of fears of a possible naval war, Japan had to reject President Roosevelt's proposal to reduce naval strength by 20% based on the existing ratio. Davis replied that naval equality between Japan and the United States would be equivalent to creating Japanese superiority because Japan's naval bases within its country have a superior position, and Japan should also consider that after naval equality between Japan and the US, the Philippines and other American territories in the Pacific would be unsafe. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Ratio in Disguise: British and Japanese Claims Run Counter</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The British proposal for warship construction limitations was submitted to the First Committee on the 17th. Representatives from various countries questioned Monsell's explanation, and the full picture gradually became clear. It is understood that it is a true form of ratio-ism. The Japanese side believes that it is fundamentally contrary to Japan's basic position, and therefore adopts an absolutely opposed attitude. The views of the Japanese Navy on the proposal are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the warship construction declaration, the method was indicated by the British during the preliminary consultations. Although it was not so concrete at the time, there has been no fundamental change. The proposal based on this decision will make the limits of the declaration relative and even interdependent, revealing the overall tonnage, not adopting an autonomous approach, and becoming a relative situation, fully realizing its ratio-ism. Therefore, the focus of the proposal is on this point. The classification of warships by type for the declaration method, or setting the period of the warship construction plan to six years, are all issues subsidiary to the above focus. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The House of Representatives of Japan had consultations on the Navy's next fiscal year's budget at the official residence of the Minister of the Navy at 11:00 AM today. Navy Minister Osumi and Vice-Minister Hasegawa explained in detail the urgency of the budget. Hamada, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, requested an explanation of the progress of the London Naval Disarmament Conference. Therefore, Rear Admiral Yamamoto, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau, explained the situation of the conference to date. The question-and-answer session followed: Shima Toshio asked, why doesn't the US publicly address the ratio-ism, and wouldn't it be permissible to make concessions on the common maximum limit for Japan? Rear Admiral Yamamoto replied that during the preliminary talks, the US and British had an atmosphere of support for the common maximum limit, but that Stetinius did not agree, and this was stated at the plenary conference. Ogawa Gotaro asked, what do you think of the plan based on the British warship construction limitations? Vice-Minister Hasegawa replied that since we have not received an official report, we cannot comment. However, Japan does not support the British plan. Nakajima Yadanji asked, if the claim for a common maximum limit is not accepted, will the London Conference break down, or even if it is not accepted, is there a willingness to conclude some degree of treaty on the issue of warship tonnage, gun caliber, etc.? Rear Admiral Yamamoto replied that if the common maximum limit is not accepted, then there will be a breakdown. It does not seem absolutely necessary to oppose the abolition of quantitative and qualitative agreements. If Japan's claim for a common maximum limit cannot be passed, then there will be a breakdown. (Dentsu, 18th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Observation: Difficult to Expect Success from Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Moscow - The "Izvestia" newspaper stated today in an article titled "The London Conference and Japanese Policy" that Japan is unwilling to accept the limitations set by the Washington Conference. Japanese imperialism has recently stepped up its efforts in China, resulting in forcing the UK and the US to implement joint action to preserve what is left of Japan's plans in China.</p>
<p>The newspaper believes that the unexpected delay in Japan's plans in recent weeks, namely the failure to officially declare the independence of North China, is largely due to the desire to enable Japanese representatives to obtain a better position in London, to prevent British-US friendship, and to ensure at least temporary or superficial cooperation between the UK and Japan. The newspaper also stated that there are still very powerful groups in Japan that view the UK as an important ally in the war against the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japan is still trying to obtain British "understanding" at the naval conference and conclude an agreement recognizing Japan's southward development as a way to consolidate its position in the north. However, this attempt is very slim.</p>
<p>The newspaper continued that Germany also intends to show its hand at the London Conference. We can see them planning a joint Japanese-German action, first to suppress the UK, and second to destroy the British-US connection. Regardless of how noble the goals of the conference organizers may be, this naval conference cannot allow fair observers to have any hope of promoting peace and arms reduction. Everyone feels that the conference will inevitably fail, especially with Japan at the center of the conference, and its actions and goals directly contradicting the conference's efforts.

<h3>US War Department Implements: Expansion of Air Force Program - Adding 100 Fighter Planes</h3>
<p>Washington - The War Department today began the aircraft construction program and has now signed a contract with Northrop Aircraft Corporation to build 100 fighter planes, worth US$2,560,074. These new aircraft have a speed of 250 kilometers per hour and can carry five machine guns, twenty small bombs, and four large bombs. The fuselage is based on the War Department's drawings and can accommodate one pilot and one observer, and can be used exclusively for combat with land troops. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Prominent Figure in British Naval Circles Advocates: British-US Defense Treaty - Sufficient to Prevent Aggression by Any Country</h3>
<p>London - With the Naval Conference currently underway, Lord Strabolgi, a member of the House of Lords and a prominent figure in British naval circles, spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press today, suggesting that the UK and the US conclude a naval defense treaty. Strabolgi said that the most important provision of the treaty should be that the UK open its strategically important naval ports, including the soon-to-be-completed Singapore naval base, for US fleets to use equally. At the same time, the US should also open US naval ports, shipyards, and fuel stations in various locations to the British navy. This would prevent any country from engaging in aggression at sea. Furthermore, other countries can also participate in this treaty. "I am well aware that isolationists in the US Congress will oppose this plan, and the big navy faction in the UK will not support it either, because after the establishment of this treaty, their arguments for building warships will lack a reason. However, judging from the recent agreement between the UK and France, France has allowed British warships to use French naval ports when attacked by British fleets. The prospect of success is already visible." Strabolgi also argued that the new naval agreement should abolish giant battleships. However, currently the US insists on giant ships with large cannons, while the UK is determined to increase cruisers, from fifty to seventy. Therefore, he believes that the naval conference has absolutely no basis for establishing an agreement. "The only hope now for curing the naval madness of all countries is a revolution of the taxpayers." (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hawaii Makes Final Test Flight Yesterday - Will Join Pacific Aviation</h3>

They have now completed their mission and returned home. On the 17th, they reported everything to Finance Minister Takahashi. The two men's report has close ties to China's policies on silver issues, loan issues, etc. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance believes that this issue is not simple, and plans to conduct careful research based on the two men's report, and to consider and resolve the direction of policy with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and other ministries.

<h3>Japanese Domei News Agency: Business to Begin on January 1st of Next Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Domei News Agency held its first plenary session at the Tokyo Kaikan at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th. More than 50 people attended, including representatives from various newspaper companies and members of the Japan Wireless Radio Broadcasting Bureau. Founding Committee Chairman Tanaka Tokichi presided over the meeting, reporting on the progress of the establishment of the incorporated association Domei News Agency since the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Communications invited representatives of national newspaper companies and the broadcasting bureau on May 9 of this year to encourage the establishment of a large world-class news agency. He also explained the relationship between the newspaper companies and the broadcasting bureau, and the progress of the negotiations between Domei and Dentsu News Agencies to participate in the new news agency. Finally, he expressed his gratitude for the efforts of Communications Minister Mochizuki and the officials of the Ministry of Communications and Foreign Affairs. Resolutions were made regarding the formulation of detailed articles of association, participating newspaper companies, etc. Finally, directors, executives, and the formal president were elected, and the former committee members who were acting as agents were decided. It was finally decided to start business from January 1st of next year. It is heard that to date, 75 newspaper companies have formally registered to participate in the new news agency, and 20 companies have already agreed to participate. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Civilians: Holding Group Weddings - Procedure Fee Only Requires Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo - The old customs of Japanese weddings are also very strict. According to an investigation by Yamada Yukikiyo, in the past, an upper-class family required an average of 5,000 Japanese yen for each wedding, the middle class required 2,000 yen, and ordinary families required about 500-600 yen. However, in recent years, the impact of the economic downturn has forced efforts to simplify wedding rituals. The so-called group wedding system is now popular. This was established in Nagahama Village, Oetori District, Okayama Prefecture, southern Japan. The wedding ceremony is held on the premises of the village's industrial association building, and each wedding only requires a procedure fee of 5 Japanese yen. All of the Shinto priests' thank-you gifts and all miscellaneous expenses are included. According to previous old customs, when Japanese people held a wedding ceremony, all etiquette was guided by three Shinto priests. Shinto priests are like Taoist priests in our country, and they are a specialized profession. Each wedding usually has to give them at least ten yuan as a thank-you gift. Other sacrificial dishes are also expensive. Now, the group wedding is used instead. It is economical for civilians to hold them, and it has gradually spread to various parts of Japan.</p>

<h3>Executive Headquarters for Opium Suppression Moves to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Executive Headquarters for Opium Suppression was originally scheduled to hold its first plenary session of committee members in Chongqing on the 20th.

Li Jihong, the chief secretary of the headquarters, recently accepted Chiang's order to move the headquarters to Nanjing for business. He is currently rushing to complete the move, and will stop receiving and sending documents on the 30th.

<h3>Severely Wounded Remnant Bandits in Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Hankou - The pseudo-18th Division of the remnant bandits in western Hubei and Hunan, after being routed by our army at Shanghexi, attempted to flee towards the deep mountains in the direction of Cangkou Lue Kuzhuping to enter Yunnan Province.

On the 14th of this month, the bandits fled to the vicinity of Kuzhuping, and our army defended the bunker fortifications and dealt them a heavy blow, killing bandits all over the mountains.

<h3>Students in All of Beiping Hold Large-Scale Demonstrations and Parades</h3>
<p>Divided and Departed From Four Routes But Were All Dispersed by the Police. A Citizen's Assembly Was Held in Front of Qianmen, the Mood Was Tragic.</p>
<p>Beiping Communication, After the strike and petition incident of students in Beiping, although school authorities put forth efforts to persuade them, the original plan was to resume classes on the 16th. However, because the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee scheduled the inaugural meeting at the Foreign Affairs Building on the morning of the 16th, students from dozens of schools in the city decided to hold a large parade and petition movement that day. Although the authorities were prepared early, students from all schools left school at 6:00 AM and gathered at pre-arranged locations. As a result, they were able to hold a large parade and demonstration of more than 10,000 students. Traffic inside and outside the city was cut off all day, and the city was boiling. It was truly a tragic and heroic event after the May Fourth Movement. Details are listed as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<h3>Stringent Military and Police Presence Along the Way</h3>
<p>The students' mobilization this time was highly secretive. Students from various schools were awakened from their sleep by commands to assemble. Therefore, local authorities were unaware beforehand. Only after the students had mobilized did they begin to increase security measures along the way. However, because they did not know the students' route, they speculated that they would definitely go to the Diplomatic Building. Consequently, they deployed significant police forces around Wangfujing. Water hoses were coiled around the western end of Wangfujing Street and the Dongdan area. At the same time, guards were increased around the Municipal Government. The Public Security Bureau was on high alert, as the Qianmen (Front Gate) in the south and Tiananmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace) in the north were both traditional gathering places for students. Therefore, guards were stationed every few steps in those areas. All pedestrians heading towards Hepingmen (Gate of Peace) and Qianmen were subjected to interrogation, and groups of three to five pedestrians observing were dispersed. The Xiheyan area, a crucial route for students from the outer city, was also under special guard. Police vehicles, fully armed, were lined up with bicycles alongside them. Dongjiaomin Lane also had guards, and groups of three to five students whispering together were dispersed. Simultaneously, fire engines and public security vehicles patrolled the routes from Xidan to Chang'an Street and Wangfujing. Furthermore, two regiments, the 291st and 91st of the 25th Army, marched fully armed to suppress the city, accompanied by mortars and machine guns.</p>
<h3>Peking University Students Break Through School Gates</h3>
<p>Inner-city students, led by Peking University in the Eastern District, with over 800 students from the entire school, gathered at numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and Dong (winter) at 8:00 AM. They were issued leaflets by the Traffic Corps and set off together with great momentum. However, as the first team from Xiqi (west seven) exited the school gate, three students, including those carrying flags, were arrested by the police. At that time, because the main contingent had not yet fully formed, they were unable to provide assistance. Later, when the main contingent marched along Jingshan East Street towards the Third Academy, they encountered numerous police officers who used two water hoses to spray the front ranks of the students. At this time, the disciplinary team in the main contingent bravely took the lead, disregarding their own safety, and eventually seized the water hoses from the police. Thereupon, the main contingent broke through and reassembled in front of the Third Academy, reorganized, and marched forward. Passing by the Sino-French University, Hebei Provincial No. 17 Middle School, the Municipal Higher Commercial School, and the Municipal Higher Vocational School, they shouted slogans at the entrance of each school, welcoming students to join. However, most students from these schools had already left, but some could join the parade temporarily. Those students remaining in school were unable to break out because the police had temporarily locked the school gates from the inside, preventing them from leaving. As the main contingent of Peking University students marched along Shatan Street towards Nanchizi, they shouted various slogans, distributed leaflets, and welcomed the public to freely participate in the parade. Although there were occasional guards blocking the way, there were no major conflicts, and they passed safely.</p>
<h3>Youthful Passion Spills All Over the Streets</h3>
<p>Upon reaching the middle of Nanchizi, a large number of police and security personnel suddenly appeared. They used two water hoses to spray the students while simultaneously using iron bars and batons to clash with the students. At that time, every student was determined to sacrifice themselves for the country. Although empty-handed, they showed no weakness. The disciplinary team bravely took the lead in a tragic struggle to seize batons. The remaining students charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the police. As a result, they eventually seized the water hoses. In this battle, both the police and the students suffered injuries. Afterwards, the main contingent continued south, shouting victory slogans and welcoming the public to freely participate in the patriotic movement. Exiting Nanchizi and heading west, they entered West Chang'an Street. As they passed the front of the Military Council, they clashed with a large number of soldiers and police. The police, having failed twice against the students, were determined to fight fiercely. Batons and iron bars were used ruthlessly. In this battle, more than ten students were injured. Ultimately, due to the heavy military and police presence, they could not break through and were forced to turn back east, exiting from Qianmen, hoping to join with the Normal University and other schools.</p>
<h3>West City Students Break Out</h3>
<p>Apart from a portion of students from Qinghua and Yanjing Universities who mobilized temporarily that morning and entered through Xibianmen (West Convenience Gate), over 200 students from Yanjing and Qinghua Universities who had entered the city on the 15th, met at Xizhimen (West Straight Gate) at 9:00 AM. They marched south along Beigouyan (North Ditch Bank) with students from Northeastern University. At Zujia Street, they joined over 100 students from the Engineering College of Peking University and Huabei (North China) College and continued south. Along the way, they shouted slogans, and the public's emotions were aroused, with citizens stopping to express their sympathy. The contingent passed the eastern entrance of Wuyiku (Military Clothing Warehouse), where they were dispersed by local police using force. They quickly reassembled, and over 100 students from Deqi Lake, 53, Zhicheng, and other schools continued south. At Longkeng (Dragon Pit), they joined over 100 students from Hongda Middle School and China University. At this point, the contingent was dispersed again by military and police using force, and Wu Zhongkun, a student from Hongda, and a student from China University were arrested. The contingent reassembled and joined over 100 students from the Minguo (Republic) College and the Law and Commerce College of Peking University coming from the west, north of Xidan. When the students from Minguo College left the school, they clashed with military and police, and two students were injured. The contingent continued south, exiting Xuanwumen (Martial Display Gate) to reach Changdian. Over 100 students from Normal University broke through the heavily guarded line and joined. At this time, there was a clash with military and police, and Jing Changrong, a female student from the Literature College, was arrested. The contingent continued south to reach Tianqiao (Bridge of Heaven).</p>
<h3>North and South Road Students Gather</h3>
<p>The north road consisted of over 200 students from Northeastern Zhongshan Middle School, who departed from Jiaodaokou (Traffic Crossing) and invited over 100 students from Dazhong and Zhongshan Middle Schools to march south, joining over 300 students from Jingcun, Datong, and Municipal No. 1 Middle School. They followed the route taken by Peking University and encountered no obstacles along the way, reaching Tianqiao and joining the eastern contingent. The south road consisted of over 500 students from Qinghua and Yanjing Universities in the suburbs, as well as students from Pingda (Peiping University) Agricultural College, who detoured to the breach where the Pinghan (Peiping-Hankou) Railway passed through Xibianmen, passing through Yiwai (Yi River Outer) Street and Luomashi (Mule and Horse Market) Street to Zhushikou (Pearl Market Intersection). They met with the marching contingent that had gathered there and decided to proceed directly to Tianqiao for a systematic demonstration.</p>
<h3>Decision to Enter the City at Tianqiao Gathering</h3>
<p>After the contingents of students from various schools inside and outside the city made contact, they gathered at Tianqiao at 11:00 AM. There were students from over 40 schools, including Yanjing University, Qinghua University, Normal University, Peking University, Northeastern University, Jiaotong University, Fu Jen Catholic University, the five colleges of Peiping University, the Railway College, Huabei College, China College, Minguo College, as well as Zhongshan Middle School, Huilwen Middle School, Zhonghua Middle School, Huabei Middle School, Hongda Middle School, the Mongolian-Tibetan School, Northeastern Zhongshan Middle School, Jingye Middle School, Hebei Senior High School, and Girls' No. 2 Middle School, totaling over 10,000 students. They immediately held a meeting in the open air. A student from Peking University gave an impassioned speech on a raised platform, arousing exceptional enthusiasm. They decided to go to the Diplomatic Building and then reorganized to return to the city.</p>
<h3>Holding a Civic Meeting in Front of Qianmen</h3>
<p>The students from various schools shouted slogans and distributed leaflets. Upon reaching Qianmen, the city gates were tightly closed, with soldiers of the 29th Army and armed police lined up to wait. Since the contingent could not enter the city, they held a civic meeting at the West Railway Station. Many citizens participated. They decided to go to the Diplomatic Building to petition Song Zheyuan and decided to inform the whole country of the current situation by telegram, drafted by Peking University, Normal University, Qinghua, and other schools. At this time, the military and police increased their presence, gradually forming a encirclement. Students from various schools temporarily elected representatives to negotiate opening the city gates. The military and police initially refused and fired shots into the air as a show of force. The crowd remained unmoved and continued to reason with the police. After several negotiations, they finally agreed to allow passage through Xuanwumen. After the contingent moved west, the military and police suddenly cut them off from the middle. After further negotiations, they agreed to allow Peking University, Zhongda, Huabei, and other schools to enter Qianmen. As soon as they entered the city, the military and police attacked from behind, causing great confusion. Some students were driven into Huabei Middle School. After this attack, only about 500 people remained. They then gathered again inside Xuanwumen via Justice Department Street and Rongxian Hutong and demanded that the guards open the city and allow students from outside the city to enter. The military and police there, about a battalion, not only refused to open the city but also detained the elected representatives, on the condition that they would be released if the contingent turned back. The contingent had no choice but to turn back. The military and police then attacked from behind with sabers and iron bars, causing many injuries and the ranks were scattered.</p>
<p>Student Parade Situation</p>
<h3>Police Open Fire but Students Stand Firm</h3>
<p>When the vanguard of the contingent reached the front of the West Railway Station in front of Qianmen, Zhu Yuezhi, the director of the Second Inner District, fearing that the students would enter the city, ordered the police to open fire. After the shots rang out, the crowd became even more agitated, and order was disrupted. Shops on Qianwai (Outer Qianmen) Street were closed. However, most of the parading students did not move. Later, the Fourth Outer District and others fired a total of more than twenty shots, fortunately without injuring any students. At this time, Ren Dongying, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's police vehicle team, came forward to negotiate with the general representative of the Student Union. As a result, it was agreed that some students from Peking University and other schools would enter the city from Qianmen, and the remaining contingent would be allowed to enter the city from Xuanwumen, guided by the police vehicle team. The parading students were satisfied and prepared to depart. At this time, someone proposed to hold another meeting, which was passed. It was decided to adopt nine key proposals, the contents of which are omitted.</p>
<p>Situation After the City Gates Were Closed</p>
<h3>Stalemate Between Students and Police at Closed Xuanwumen</h3>
<p>After the meeting adjourned, the students marched along the west side, shouting slogans and arousing emotions. They went from Xiangluying (Incense Camp) to Xuanwumen. The students, seeing Xuanwumen tightly closed, immediately negotiated with the police. The police demanded that students from Qinghua, Yanjing, and the Agricultural College first go to Xibianmen before Xuanwumen could be opened. However, the students demanded that Xuanwumen be opened first. After the students inside the city entered the city, the students outside the city could return to school from Xibianmen. They also demanded that the arrested students be released immediately and that the students inside the city be guaranteed not to be suppressed by force after entering the city. The police insisted that the students outside the city must go to Xibianmen before Xuanwumen could be opened, so they persisted. The students decided that if Xuanwumen was not opened, the students would camp in the streets until the next day's march. At this time, Lu Cui, a Qinghua representative, tried to enter the city from under the gate of Xuanwumen and was immediately arrested. Outside Xuanwumen, there were still students from Yanjing, Peking University, Jihua, and other schools standing on the street.</p>
<h3>Standing and Lecturing, Tragic and Miserable</h3>
<p>After deciding to camp out, representatives from various schools were sent to buy food, as the students had all left at 7:00 AM without eating anything. Over 200 students from Northeastern University were prepared to spend the night on an empty stomach. Students from the Normal University and its affiliated middle school donated over a thousand sets of sesame cakes and gave them to Northeastern University to satisfy their hunger. At this time, students from various schools lectured to the citizens. All the students cried miserably, and the citizens standing on both sides were all moved to tears. Until after 7:00 PM, many students from the schools outside the city returned to school to lead the school workers, carrying large batches of bedding and cold water to supply the students camping out.</p>
<h3>Severe Beating and Dispersal of Contingent Outside Xuanwumen</h3>
<p>However, at 9:00 PM, a group of students proposed that the contingent should return to the Normal University for a meeting in preparation for renewed efforts. At the time, the entire contingent unanimously passed the motion. Thereupon, the contingent, in the shadowy darkness, slowly moved south along the main street. The vanguard reached Caishikou (Vegetable Market Intersection). Because a large number of military and police were stationed there in advance, they immediately clashed with the students. In addition to spraying the students with water hoses, the police also beat them severely with gun butts and wooden sticks. The students, unable to resist empty-handed, became disorganized in the front ranks and retreated backwards. Unexpectedly, the rear ranks were also attacked by a large number of police who had been pre-deployed with wooden sticks. At this time, the shops on both sides of the main street were closed, and the households were shut. The contingent of students had no way to advance or retreat, and many were injured by beatings with sticks and gun butts. At that time, the students' cries for help and groans were unbearable to hear. Especially the female students in the middle school section, because of their young age and unfamiliarity with walking, were exhausted after a day of marching and long journeys and could not even lift their feet. At this time, after being severely beaten, many were unable to escape. After an hour and a half, the entire contingent was dispersed. It was reported that about one hundred and several dozen students were injured in this incident.</p>
<h3>Temporarily Seeking Refuge by Fleeing to Various Schools</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 PM, after the contingent of parading students outside Xuanwumen was severely beaten and dispersed by the police, some went west into the school grounds, and some went east into Xicaochang (West Grass Field). Because it was already late at night, the main streets and thoroughfares were all temporarily under martial law, and pedestrians were interrogated. Most of the parading students were students from schools in the city, so they could not return to school to stay. Therefore, in addition to some who scattered to stay with relatives and friends outside the city, the remaining students were reported to have fled to the Normal University and the South Campus of Northeastern University to seek refuge temporarily. It was also heard that another meeting was held at the Normal University, but the results are unknown.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan's Letter of Admonition to Students</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, issued a letter of admonition to the students, saying, "Recently, college students have been petitioning everywhere. If the meaning is purely a patriotic action, it will naturally be sympathized with by society and even more admired by Zheyuan. However, according to reliable reports, there are quite a few Communist elements in the student groups. Most of the pure students are deceived and instigated by the Communist elements, who use and drive them, wasting their studies, which is very regrettable. Zheyuan's thorough anti-Communist attitude has long been hated by the Communists, who have seized the opportunity to carry out activities, which is expected. However, most students should recognize the Communist Party's conspiracies and the proper path to saving the country, and make rational distinctions, avoiding shallow blind following. The Hopei-Chahar Political Council is no different from the Southwest Political Council. Since it is the order of the Central Government, it is certainly necessary to establish it. Zheyuan is a soldier and is not good at politics, but he is unwilling to lag behind in serving the country and the people. All measures are based on the interests of the entire country, and will never be influenced by the propaganda of a few Communist elements. Finally, I hope that all students who understand the overall situation and recognize the great righteousness should immediately realize this, concentrate on their studies, and stop running around in vain. If a few Communist elements still act outside the law, Zheyuan will take appropriate measures to stop them in order to maintain order and stabilize people's hearts. Song Zheyuan."</p>
<h3>Meeting of University Presidents to See the Mayor</h3>
<p>On the 16th, at 12:00 noon, the authorities of various universities held a meeting at the American-European Students Association to discuss the issue of student parades. The attendees included Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, Mei Yiqi, President of Qinghua University, Li Zheng, President of Normal University, Xu Songming, President of Peiping University, Lu Zhiwei, President of Yanjing University, Wang Zhuoran, President of Northeastern University, Li Linyu, President of the Sino-French University, and Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University. As a result, it was decided that the university authorities should provide substantive guidance on the student parades and that the local authorities should not exert excessive pressure on the students. Subsequently, Jiang Menglin and Wang Zhuoran went to the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM to visit Mayor Qin Dechun to negotiate and left at 3:30 PM. That evening, the university presidents attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Qin Dechun, with Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying also in attendance. The university presidents put forward the following points: 1. Please ask the local authorities not to arrest students in order to avoid escalating the situation. 2. Please do not censor news about the student movement in Peiping newspapers, as more censorship leads to more rumors, and rumors are more harmful to public security than the truth. 3. The issue of students attending classes should still be guided by the university authorities, and the local authorities should withdraw the police and plainclothes officers in front of the university gates. 4. It is hoped that the work of the Hopei-Chahar Political Council will prioritize maintaining the integrity of Chinese territory in order to stabilize the hearts of the people in North China. Mayor Qin Dechun expressed acceptance of the opinions of the university presidents, and the banquet ended happily. At noon on the 17th, the university presidents gathered again at the American-European Students Association for a luncheon to continue discussing solutions. During the luncheon, the university presidents reported in detail on the situation of students from their respective universities who had been arrested and injured on the 16th. Next, they discussed the following results: 1. Rescue the fourteen students who were arrested on the 16th. 2. Presidents of each university to send representatives or personally visit the injured students to express condolences. 3. The problem of attendance is still under the guidance of deans. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM (17th).</p>
<h3>Wuhan Students Organize a United National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Second Emergency Joint Meeting Confirmed the Organization and Elected Representatives from Wuhan University and 15 Other Schools as Directors</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The entire student body of secondary and higher education institutions in Wuhan, in support of the patriotic movement of students in Peiping, held the First Emergency Joint Meeting of Representatives from 41 schools, resolving to send a telegram to the whole country opposing any pseudo-autonomous organizations that divide national territory. At the same time, they sent a telegram to encourage the students in Peiping to live and die with Peiping, and the students in Wuhan swore to be their shield. On the 17th, they held the Second Emergency Joint Meeting, with the participation of students from more than 50 schools, with 120 representatives. National Wuhan University, Zhonghua University, Huazhong University, and the Institute of Education all participated, and the atmosphere was more tense than before. At 2:00 PM, a preparatory meeting was held first, and representatives from Huazhong University, Wuhan University, and the Institute of Education were elected as the presidium, and representatives from Zhonghua University and the Provincial High School were elected as secretaries. At 2:30 PM, the official meeting was held, and Xu Shengbi was elected as the General Chairman. The following key proposals were resolved: 1. All students from secondary and higher education institutions in Wuhan shall organize a permanent united group. 2. The name of the group shall be designated as the Wuhan United National Salvation Association of All Students from Secondary and Higher Education Institutions. 3. The organizational charter of the association shall be passed in principle according to the draft proposed by Zhonghua University. Detailed measures shall be determined after the board of directors is produced. 4. Hold a parade of all students from secondary and higher education institutions in the three towns of Wuhan. Detailed measures and dates shall be determined after the board of directors is produced, and propaganda teams shall be organized separately by each school to expand national salvation propaganda. 5. The board of directors shall be elected by vote, and the results shall be as follows: representatives from 15 units, including Wuhan University, Huada, Zhongda, Senior Business School, No. 2 Girls' High School, Senior Technical School, Girls' Normal School, Xiangshi, Wuhan Middle School, Provincial High School, Boxue, Provincial Normal School, Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Institute of Education, and Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School, were elected as directors, and representatives from Yujie, Xilida, and Art School were elected as alternate directors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. All the directors immediately held their first meeting and elected standing directors. Representatives from seven units, including Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School, High School, Zhongda, Xiangshi, Institute of Education, Huada, and Wuhan University, were elected, and the No. 2 Girls' High School and the Senior Technical School were elected as alternate standing directors. The articles of association shall be reviewed by the Standing Directors in accordance with the principles passed by the General Assembly and submitted to the General Meeting of Directors for approval and implementation. The leaders of each group shall be nominated by the Standing Committee. The date of the parade was not discussed due to the lateness of the hour. The most noteworthy aspect of the association's organization is that it is a permanent group rather than a temporary gathering. The organizational principles passed roughly stipulate that the General Assembly of All Representatives is the highest authority, the Board of Directors is the highest legislative body after the adjournment of the General Assembly of All Representatives, and the Standing Committee of Directors is the highest executive body. The Standing Committee of Directors shall have a chairman, and shall be divided into three groups: document, general affairs, and propaganda. The General Assembly of All Representatives shall be jointly organized by two representatives officially elected from each unit by student groups from secondary and higher education institutions in Wuhan, and shall be held once per semester. The Board of Directors shall be organized by two representatives from each of the fifteen units elected by the General Assembly of All Representatives and shall be held once every two months. The Standing Committee of Directors shall be organized by one representative from each of the seven units mutually elected by all the directors of the Board of Directors and shall hold a meeting once a month. The chairman of the Standing Committee and the leaders of each group shall be mutually elected by the Standing Directors, and shall be re-elected every semester and may be re-elected once. The membership fees for each member shall be 5 yuan per semester for colleges and universities, 4 yuan for complete secondary schools and normal schools, and 2 yuan for senior high schools or junior high schools, which shows the determination to struggle for a long time.</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Board of Education Participated in the National Salvation Movement, and on the 17th, Sent Telegrams to Various Parties to Suppress Rebels and Submitted a Telegram to the Central National Government, which read: "Yin Rugeng, a rebel, occupies Yanji, creating cunning names and delaying execution until now. All nationals deeply resent this. I hope that the National Government will launch a large-scale suppression to curb the chaos. I also request that the Peiping military and police authorities maintain the righteousness of the academic community. I hereby send this telegram for consideration." They sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan and other military and political leaders, which read: "The rebel Yin launched a rebellion in eastern Hebei, destroying the integrity of the territory. You are the heart of the country, entrusting the key to the northern gate. I urge you to quickly follow the Central Government's order to remove and arrest him, swear to denounce him, so that jumping clowns will not play in the Huangchi for long, and stupid villains will compile their tricks, permanently securing the border, with your merits being inscribed on the mountains and rivers. I also pray that you maintain the righteousness of the academic community in Peiping, and the patriots of the whole country will be your backing. I hereby send this telegram for your consideration." They sent a telegram to student representatives and educators of all schools in Peiping, which read: "Unfortunately, our country has been plagued by frequent incidents. In this autumn of turmoil in North China, you lecture in dangerous cities, promote just arguments, boost the morale of the nation, and establish the voice of righteousness in the world. The students of all schools can uphold righteousness and fight against the evil environment. The nation's recovery depends on you. This board admires your work and pledges to follow in your footsteps, vigorously protecting the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty. I hereby send this telegram for your condolences and request your consideration. Hubei Provincial Board of Education, stamped with the seal of Xiao Yin" (17th).</p>
<h3>The Hopei-Chahar Political Committee Held a Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>The Organizational Outline Has Arrived in Peiping - The Preparatory Meeting Decided on Several Cases</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Hopei-Chahar Political Committee was originally scheduled to be formally established at 10:00 AM on the 16th in the old Diplomatic Building, without holding a ceremony. The organizational outline of the committee was issued by the Central Government on the 14th, and the contents are that the committee will have 17 to 19 members, one chairman, and five standing committee members. Under the chairman, there will be three offices: secretary, political affairs, and finance. If necessary, special committees may be established, and a number of advisors and consultants may be appointed. The chairman of the committee, Song Zheyuan, invited the committee members to a talk at his private residence in Wuyiku at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Those present included Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Hu Yukun, and Leng Jiaji, who were in Peiping. They rested at 4:00 PM and had tea. At 5:50 PM, Wang Yitang, Gao Lingwei, and Li Tingyu, who were in Tianjin, rushed from Tianjin by the Peining Railway to participate.

At noon, Song hosted a banquet for all the committee members present in the Diplomatic Building. It was heard that the Secretariat of the Committee would have four sections: documentation, general affairs, and conferences. The names of the five standing committee members of the committee and the special committees would be decided at the first general meeting. The candidates for the standing committee members were Cheng Ke, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Yitang, Gao Lingwei, and Men Zhizhong. Song will concurrently serve as the Director of the Hopei-Chahar Pacification Office after the establishment of the committee. The internal organization of the office will also strive to be strengthened, and most of the candidates for the positions in various offices and sections have been internally determined. It is planned that Gao Shengyue will serve as the director of the Liaison Office (17th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Villagers Bury Coins, Robbed by Thieves</h3>
<p>Gong Rongsheng, a villager from Lengshui Bay, Nineteenth Ward, outside the South Gate of this city, was frugal and industrious, and had accumulated a considerable amount of wealth. Around midnight on the 17th, more than ten robbers, speaking with local accents, suddenly broke into his house. They passed the bedroom of the victim's daughter-in-law, and the robbers instructed everyone not to enter, because she was a widow, etc. Then they went to Rongsheng's bedroom, overturned chests, and found more than one thousand silver dollars. Unsatisfied, the robbers tied up the victim and his wife with ropes, hung them up, and beat them, burning them with candles. The victim's wife, unable to bear the pain, finally revealed that there was still sixteen years' worth of silver coins hidden under the roof tiles. The robbers followed the clue and obtained another one thousand yuan, totaling about three thousand yuan. The robbers then fled with the stolen goods. The victim was about to report to the authorities for investigation, but was dissuaded by the local police, who warned that since the stolen goods were mostly obsolete silver coins, it would only bring trouble in the future. Therefore, the victim remained silent and only wept.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Mother and Triplets All Safe</h3>
<p>Xu Qingyuan, a thirty-five-year-old local machine worker, lives at No. 12 Pingjiang Lane, Qimen Road. He married Xia, who is twelve years old. The couple have a harmonious relationship and have already had two sons. Xia recently became pregnant again and carried the pregnancy to term. On the afternoon of the 17th, around 2:00 PM, labor began. The nearby midwife, Shen Wang, was invited to the house to assist with the delivery. Around 3:00 PM, one son was born. Unexpectedly, after only three minutes, two more sons were born in succession. The family was both surprised and delighted by the situation. Many people came to watch upon hearing the news, almost crowding the doorway. Currently, the mother and all three sons are safe and well.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: High Wall Collapses, Crushing Many to Death</h3>
<p>There were five eastward-facing bungalows behind Xiaodong Leng Temple in Dongyuan Lane, Hangzhou. All of them were inhabited by elderly, weak, and poor people. At 1:35 AM on the 18th, a high wall of the Hua family next door collapsed suddenly because it was damaged and not repaired. Four of the bungalows across from it were crushed. The residents Che Changsheng, Ye Aba, Feng Along, Bao Amao, Bao Jinshi, and his son Monk were all buried in the rubble. The neighbors were awakened and reported to the police station, who dispatched rescue efforts. As a result, Che Changsheng, Bao Jinshi, Bao Monk, and Ye Aba died one after another in the morning due to their severe injuries. The other two were also seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Japan's Elder Statesmen and Senior Ministers (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Yicang</p>
<p>The Internal Strife Between the Spiritual Movement Faction and the Liberal Faction</p>
<p>3. The Rise of Conservatism</p>
<p>From what we have said above, we can see that the elder statesmen and senior ministers, with Prince Saionji Kinmochi at the center, advocated liberalism and democracy as the foundation for governing the country. However, there is also a conservative faction in Japan that rejects these senior ministers. This faction is now gaining momentum and almost surpassing the liberal faction in power. Since Count Katō Takaaki organized the Three Constitutional Factions, the party cabinets have taken turns guarding constitutional politics for many years, which can be called the golden age of political parties. However, in recent years, the expansion of capitalism has made the lives of the people increasingly impoverished. The masses cannot bear the pain of reality, and a movement to "overthrow liberal justice" has swept the country. In this movement, the right-leaning radicals, under the banner of "opening up the situation," are inclined towards fascism. Those who reject the theory of the senior ministers take the opportunity to rise up and often make things difficult for the senior ministers' faction centered on Saionji. The two sides are now in fierce conflict. This can also be said to be a conflict between the "military faction" and the "civilian faction." The military faction, centered on Tanaka Mitsuaki, is also known as the conservative faction, and is formed by uniting the military and right-wing civilian groups. However, this faction, due to the suppression of the times, has not yet been able to fully reveal its power. Therefore, Tanaka Mitsuaki is unhappy and lives in seclusion in the countryside. However, Tanaka is a count, a major general in the army, and has served as Minister of the Imperial Household. During the Meiji Restoration, he was one of the few samurai along with Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori. This year, he is already ninety-two years old and still has a vigorous spirit. He often disagrees with the senior ministers on a personal level. The senior ministers are also constrained by historical relationships and can do nothing about it. He displays the spirit of a samurai in his true colors. It is said that after the September 18th Manchurian Incident, he was very dissatisfied with the actions of the senior ministers and once "entered the palace with a sword to remonstrate with the Emperor." The Emperor also praised his ambition and comforted him.</p>
<p>Tanaka's closest friend is Marquis Asano Nagatoshi. Asano is a descendant of a famous family and has served as an envoy and a member of the Senate. When the Diet was established in the Meiji 23rd year, he became a member of the House of Peers. He once impeached Ichiki for the "Emperor as an Organ" theory along with Tanaka. He is now also living in seclusion in Hiroshima.</p>
<p>One who reveres Tanaka's conservative ideology and can modernize it, and is listed among the senior ministers, is Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, the current Vice President of the Privy Council. Hiranuma has served in the judicial system for a long time, holding positions such as Chief Prosecutor, Minister of Justice, Privy Councilor, and Vice President. He bases his ideology on Japanism, advocates spiritual movements, and promotes inherent morality. He can be said to be the leader of the Japanese fascist movement, and has a close relationship with the current army giants Araki Sadao and Masaki Jinzaburō. The spiritual movement he advocates focuses on "quality" and is incompatible with democracy that emphasizes "quantity." Recently, he has been using the psychology of some citizens to advocate opening up the current situation. In May and June of this year, he used the "Emperor as an Organ" issue to try to overthrow the Okada Cabinet. However, Hiranuma's ideas do not have much influence within the army. In the navy, he is completely out of favor. The elder statesmen and senior ministers also say that he is not the kind of person to seize power. Therefore, his solo performance still cannot gain popularity. When Privy Council President Kuratomi resigned, Hiranuma should have been promoted as a matter of course, but the senior ministers unanimously opposed it and supported Ichiki. Hiranuma was therefore resentful, and his rejection of the senior ministers is even more intense than others.</p>
<p>4. The Theory of the Emperor as an Organ</p>
<p>The atmosphere of rejecting the senior ministers began with the "Emperor as an Organ" theory. This issue became the center of debate in the last Diet. Since this summer, it has become even more intense. Recently, it has gone from disputes over arguments to investigating the essence. The "spiritual movement" faction wants to use this case as a fatal bomb to throw at the "status quo maintenance" faction. There are many types of people participating in this movement, including pure spiritual movement factions and those who use this issue as a tool to overthrow the cabinet. Such as Baron Kikuchi Takeo, Baron Idata Iwakusu, Baron Inoue Kiyosumi, Viscount Mimuroto Keiko of the House of Peers, Oi Narumoto in the military clique, Ishizuka Eizo, Akaike No, Hosokawa Moritatsu, Tokugawa Yoshichika, and other members of the elected Diet, Yamamoto Teijiro of the Seiyukai in the House of Representatives, Director Suzuki, Kuhara, Hatoyama, Shimada and other executives, as well as almost all other right-wing groups, the military's attitude is deemed strong. Watanabe, the Education Director of the Army, and General Abe Nobuyuki, once forced the former Minister of the Army, Hayashi Senjuro, to impeach Ichiki. Hayashi then proposed the three major claims of "clarifying the national essence" to Prime Minister Okada: First, the cabinet should declare in its name that it would abolish the organ theory. Second, it should order the correction of books and prohibit their sale. Third, it should punish those who believe in the organ theory. However, in addition to Minobe Tatsukichi (a member of the House of Peers and a master of Japanese constitution) and his works, those who believe in the organ theory also include Ichiki, the President of the Privy Council, and Kanamori, the Director of the Legislative Bureau. In order to save face, the government first declared on August 3 that it denied the organ theory. Then, on August 15, the cabinet decided for the second time to clarify that "the subject of sovereignty does not reside in the Emperor but in the state, and the Emperor is an organ of the state," and clarified that "the subject of sovereignty resides in the Emperor." These two declarations were the result of several compromises between the government and the military. However, those who were dissatisfied with Ichiki, opposed the senior ministers, and wanted to use this to overthrow the cabinet, were still unwilling to give up. Everyone pressured the government with demands to refresh personnel. However, the elder statesmen and senior ministers are ultimately the highest figures who create cabinets and control national affairs, and are called "gods guarding constitutional politics." They are also united and form a "senior minister alliance" that is very strict in defending against the opposition. Therefore, although the opposition has repeatedly tried to take advantage of the situation, the deeply rooted elder statesmen and senior ministers cannot be overthrown for a while. Moreover, judging from the recent national character of Japan, the opposition may not be supported by the majority of the people. For example, in this year's general election of prefectural assembly members in two prefectures and thirty-seven counties, right-wing groups remained weak. It can be seen that the credibility of political parties is still very high, and the foundation of parliamentary politics is not easily shaken.</p>
<p>In addition to its own power, the "senior minister alliance" also has external power. This is the bureaucracy that they have united with, with the Satsuma faction and quasi-Satsuma faction as the backbone. The current Prime Minister Okada Keisuke has a deep relationship with the senior ministers, because Okada was recommended by Saito. Now Saito is the chief of staff of the "senior minister alliance," and can also be said to be the leader of the senior ministers. If the opposition wants to overthrow Ichiki and Saito, they will inevitably have to involve Makino Nobuaki and Yamamoto Gonnohyoe. This is too much to handle. Ichiki was recommended by him. Ichiki once wanted to resign due to the opposition's attacks, but due to environmental reasons, he was unable to retire. This is a sign of the internal unity of the senior ministers.</p>
<p>The situation of the secret strife between the spiritual movement faction and the liberal faction in Japan in recent years is roughly like this. If we want to understand the power of the current elder statesmen and senior ministers, we must also mention this.

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Ministry of Finance: Exemption from Confiscation of Silver Coins Collected; Guidance to Legal Institutions for Exchange of Legal Tender; Circulation of Silver Subsidiary Currency Permitted by Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating (the above omitted): "After the implementation of the new currency policy, we received a telegram from your ministry stating that in areas where legal tender cannot be exchanged for the time being, it is permitted to maintain the original customs temporarily, and that all associations and tax authorities should promptly collect and exchange silver coins and raw silver, etc., and transport them to areas where legal tender is available for exchange. Furthermore, Article 1 of the Measures for the Exchange of Legal Tender, promulgated on November 15, stipulates that silver coins and raw silver should be exchanged for legal tender at nearby exchange institutions within three months from November 4, 24. These provisions, while restrictive, also indicate an intention to adapt to local conditions and exercise appropriate leniency. The areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are mostly remote small towns that lack branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank. Even tax authorities such as post offices are often not established. When travelers go to the countryside and collect payments, if the other party pays in silver coins and silver subsidiary currency, it is difficult to refuse. Since there are no legal tender exchange institutions in the local area, they cannot obtain the exchange. Most of these merchants and travelers are limited in their knowledge and do not exchange legal tender at the arriving stations. Therefore, they bring silver coins and silver subsidiary currency with them to Shanghai. In terms of sentiment, this is indeed understandable. According to the above two ministry orders, the fault does not lie with the holders of silver coins and silver subsidiary currency themselves. Station police officers performing their duties by checking is appropriate, but they should also carefully investigate the truth. If it is indeed a small amount of silver coins and silver subsidiary currency collected from rural towns that cannot be exchanged, they should be guided to legal exchange institutions to exchange for legal tender. If they are summarily confiscated and fined without distinguishing the circumstances, it seems that both human sentiment and legal principles are not being taken into account. The circulation of silver subsidiary currency is permitted by law, and confiscating everything is undoubtedly excessive. In addition to petitioning the Shanghai Municipal Government to issue an order to the Public Security Bureau to exempt from confiscation the aforementioned silver coins and silver subsidiary currency collected from rural accounts that cannot be exchanged, we also respectfully submit this document, requesting your esteemed review and instructions, and that you instruct the relevant authorities to issue a concise announcement at each station and wharf along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway regarding the exchange of legal tender measures, clearly informing the merchants and travelers so that they do not inadvertently violate the law. At the same time, we also request that you instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Public Security Bureau to exempt from confiscation the aforementioned silver coins and silver subsidiary currency brought to Shanghai, so as to show that there is no injustice and to serve the public interest."</p>
<h3>Currency Policy Effective: Silver Exports Disappear</h3>
<p>Balance Tax Rate Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Since the government implemented the new currency policy and nationalized silver, except for foreign merchants who exported silver due to a trade deficit, Chinese merchants have not engaged in such activities. Regarding international exchange rates, since the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank have been buying and selling without restrictions, the telegraphic transfer rate has gradually declined, achieving a stabilizing effect. At the same time, silver exports have also disappeared due to the currency reform in China, which has led to a sharp increase in the price of foreign goods and a scarcity of imports. The balance tax rate, which prevents the outflow of silver, continues to decline. Yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Market Stabilization Committee of the Central Bank posted a rate of 32.25%, which is 6.25% lower than the previous day's rate of 38.5%.</p>
<h3>Central Mint Ordered to Mint Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>Models Cast in America, Director Huang Brings to Shanghai; Silver, Nickel, and Copper Trial Minting Begins; Silver Coin Minting Temporarily Suspended, Minting Ingots in Preparation</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy, in order to unify subsidiary coins, in addition to stipulating the price of subsidiary coins, it also ordered the Central Mint to start minting decimal subsidiary coins in silver, nickel, and copper. The new models have been cast in the United States and brought to Shanghai at the end of last month by Director Huang of the Minting Department, who has reported to the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that the new models are all decimal.</p>
<p>Mint Has Started Trial Minting</p>
<p>The Central Mint has started trial minting with the new models a few days ago. After the trial minting samples are submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval, formal minting will be scheduled. The new subsidiary coins are in denominations of one, five, ten, twenty, and fifty cents. One cent is made of copper, five, ten, and twenty cents are made of nickel, and fifty cents are made of silver.</p>
<p>Inspection and Qualification for Circulation</p>
<p>As for the fineness of the fifty-cent subsidiary coins, the Ministry of Finance is currently studying it. After the fineness is determined and the trial minting samples are reviewed, minting will begin. The subsidiary coins that are minted in the future will be reviewed by the Factory Inspection Committee. After the inspection is qualified, a public announcement will be made and they will be released for circulation on the market. At the same time, at the regular meeting of the Inspection Committee on the second Friday of each month, the assayist, Mr. Grayder, will report on the assaying process to ensure credibility.</p>
<p>Silver Coin Minting Temporarily Suspended, Minting Ingots</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the market, the factory has temporarily suspended the minting of silver coins since the 13th of this month and will mint 880 fineness factory ingots as preparation. As for the 999 grade A factory ingots, a total of more than 3,200 ingots have been cast so far, and they are currently also temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>National Post Offices Ordered to Exchange Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Ministries of Finance and Communications Negotiate Legal Tender Exchange Contract</p>
<p>Shiye News reports that after the Ministry of Finance issued an emergency decree on November 4 of this year to implement the new currency policy, silver has been completely centralized and remitted to the Issuance Reserve Committee as a fund. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the area of the country is vast, and the strength of the three banks cannot reach everywhere. In order to do its best to prevent the outflow of silver from the people, it has specially entered into a legal tender exchange contract with the Ministry of Communications to facilitate the collection. It is reported that the exchange of legal tender is being negotiated, and the method is very perfect, which benefits both the country and the people. It is expected that it can be implemented throughout the ministry. It is understood that in addition to the post offices in various places being required to comply with the handling, the Postal Savings Bureau is also ordered to do the same. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has now stipulated four temporary measures to be paid on the market: All branches and postal remittance stores must immediately seal up their existing coins and no longer pay them out, and immediately report the number of deposits; The deposits and remittances due shall be paid with banknotes from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank, as well as bank notes approved by the Ministry of Finance, and the payment methods of other banks shall be ascertained and handled uniformly; International drafts shall be handled in accordance with the Central Bank's market quotations; In the event that a branch's funds are insufficient to pay, it may contact the three banks for borrowing and allocation at any time. The above measures have been received by the branches and postal remittance bureaus, and they have been ordered to comply. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will open a list of all the existing silver sealed by each bureau and send a letter to the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance for reference.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loan Association Loans 400,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Investigating the Borrowers' Situations at any Time</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Examination Committee, in accordance with the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, has allocated 3 million yuan from the amount of loans to be used as a fund for handling acceptance bills, and has drafted measures, which have been submitted to the meeting for approval. After approval, letters were sent to the Central Bank and the Silver and Money Industry Association to solicit opinions. According to the person in charge of the association, the replies from all parties are expected to arrive in the next few days. If a proposal is submitted, it will be submitted to the committee meeting next Monday for discussion and decision, and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and handling. It is also learned that since the association started lending, it has approved loans of about 400,000 yuan. The term is generally one year, and some are required to be repaid in installments, which are repaid on schedule. The association investigates the business situation of general borrowers at any time, and obtains the assistance of reliable guarantors, so it is quite clear.</p>

<h3>Customs Patrol Boats: Please Use Chinese Nationals as Captains</h3>
<p>The Chinese Society of Marine Engineering's Efforts to Fight For It</p>
<p>The Chinese Society of Marine Engineering submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: Regarding the crew members of customs patrol boats, they should be Chinese nationals to safeguard sovereignty and save national funds. It is with deep regret that our country's customs, bound by unequal treaties, has all important positions held by foreign advisors. From the Commissioner of Customs to the Port Authority, any authority involving sensitive matters is entirely controlled by foreigners, infringing upon our national rights and harming our national dignity. It is like wielding a great weapon upside down, a painful thing to speak of. In recent years, our central government has been striving for tariff autonomy, seeking to break free from shackles, recover lost rights, and establish national prestige. Since the Ministry of Transportation reorganized navigation administration, it has also resolutely recovered the navigation rights previously seized by customs. This not only enhances our national prestige and safeguards our maritime rights, but also fills every Chinese person with admiration. However, in recent years, the customs has been constructing a large number of patrol boats to rectify tax evasion and pay attention to anti-smuggling. When these boats were completed, the Society sent a letter to the Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs on July 12th of the 23rd year (of the Republic), requesting that five of the patrol boats be designated in advance for the appointment of marine engineers of all levels, employing Chinese crew members with maritime expertise and Ministry of Transportation certificates to manage them. We have repeatedly stated our reasons and requested their employment. However, after repeated consultations, we were almost exhausted. The intention of the Society was merely to uphold the central government's policy, safeguard the nation's territorial waters, adhere to the Ministry's guidance, and recover lost rights and interests. Therefore, we spared no words and exchanged numerous letters and telegrams, hoping to achieve the goal of having Chinese crew members manage Chinese customs patrol boats. If the customs side could awaken slightly, it should abandon its traditional control policy, lift its high-pressure monopoly, and completely return navigation administrative rights to our country. However, the Inspector General of Customs' reply offered no reasons, merely claiming that our country had no suitable candidates and that foreign engineers had to be hired. The Customs Administration also blindly followed suit, echoing what others said. Such unfounded remarks are the only habitual trick used by foreigners to maintain control. It not only contradicts the facts but also insults all our crew members. However, the loss or gain of the Society is small, while the impact on the nation's recovery of navigation rights is significant. The use of Chinese nationals to manage customs patrol boats is undeniable in both fact and theory, and they should not be allowed to shirk responsibility. We respectfully present the most obvious facts below: Since the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was taken over by the Ministry of Transportation, all foreign crew members on its ships have been replaced by Chinese. When four new ocean-going vessels were built the year before last and began sailing in overseas waters, the Hong Kong government also used the excuse that the lives and property of passengers were at stake, claiming that our country had no qualified personnel and that foreign crew members had to be hired, holding the same view as the customs authorities. However, when the *Haiheng*, *Haili*, and *Haizhen* vessels were completed, all positions from the captain to the chief engineer were filled by Chinese. More than a year has passed since they began sailing, and their excellence in navigation and marine engineering skills and the low cost of their salaries are undeniable advantages over foreign crew members. Facts speak louder than words. The Hong Kong government also expressed its admiration and realized the error of its previous views, acknowledging that the skills of Chinese crew members are no longer comparable to what they were a decade ago and that they now have the ability to manage first-class ocean-going vessels sailing in international seaports. The new-style engines and machinery of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's four *Hai* class vessels are far more complex than those of customs patrol boats, yet our Chinese marine engineers manage them with ease and satisfaction. Managing customs patrol boats would be even easier. The Inspector General of Customs' claim that there are no suitable candidates is simply not true. This point refutes itself. The customs belongs to our nation, and the Inspector General of Customs is employed by our government. He has only the obligation to obey our country. Therefore, the patrol boats he builds should primarily employ Chinese nationals. However, he dismisses Chinese crew members and employs foreign engineers. This is either due to his biased intentions or some other hidden agenda. In recent years, our country has produced a large number of marine engineering specialists. Graduates from the Wusong Merchant Marine School are of university-equivalent level, have undergone extensive practical training, and hold Ministry of Transportation certificates. They are fully qualified to serve on domestic ships and vessels, and there is no need to borrow talent from foreign countries. The engineers of the customs patrol boats should respect our national sovereignty and implement the Ministry of Transportation's policy of completing the entire navigation administration. The Society should select members with excellent academic and practical experience to be responsible for these positions. We are confident that we have the ability to do so. If we are wrong, then let us first ask the customs to designate several patrol boats, with the marine engineering personnel selected by the Society to be fully responsible for managing them. This would allow for a comparison of strengths and weaknesses with the boats managed by foreign crew members, judging the actual efficiency and the quality of work. The treatment of foreign crew members is exceptionally generous, with very high salaries, costing the nation a great deal of money each year. Replacing them with Chinese nationals would mean that the salaries saved from several ships could be used to add more patrol boats. This would both strengthen our maritime rights and benefit our national treasury. The implications of gain and loss are truly significant. In summary, these six reasons show that the use of Chinese nationals on customs patrol boats, while not divinely ordained, is an irrefutable principle. Furthermore, foreign crew members are not necessarily all-powerful. Jealousy and exclusion are their strengths, and high-pressure monopoly is their habitual trick. The Society does not wish to imitate the Inspector General of Customs' tone, using vague terms to reject and close the door. In reality, his true motives are exposed, revealing his desire to maintain control. Regarding all matters of foreigners infringing upon our rights and interests, employing their own kind, monopolizing patrol boats, and refusing to employ Chinese personnel, we request that the Ministry order the Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs to replace all foreign personnel on all customs patrol boats with Chinese nationals. At the very least, please allocate several boats to be managed by our Chinese marine engineers to safeguard sovereignty and save national funds. We are extremely anxious about this matter. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Finance.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Left Eye Swollen and Painful</h3>
<p>Central Hospital's Ophthalmology Director Summoned to Shanghai for Examination; Result Shows Swelling and Pain in Left Cheek Affecting the Eye, Not an Eye Disease Itself</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, experienced swelling and pain in his left eye and telegraphed Nanjing the day before yesterday, requesting Dr. Lin Wenbing, Director of Ophthalmology at the Central Hospital, to come to Shanghai for examination.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves the National Goods Alliance; Lowering Interest Rates Already Ordered to be Implemented</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Promotion Alliance Committee previously submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance recommending the implementation of eight measures, including the establishment of real estate mortgage. Yesterday, the Committee received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating: Your submission on November 6th of the 24th year (of the Republic) regarding the request to use legal tender to control industry and commerce, implement mortgage loans to revitalize finance, and establish a plan for revival has been noted. The real estate mortgage regulations have already been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Legislative and Judicial Yuans for amendment. The establishment of a real estate mortgage bank is currently being actively planned. Once the bank is established, it will be able to handle real estate mortgage loans to meet the needs. As for the mortgage of goods from domestic factories, the factories should negotiate on their own. Furthermore, the reduction of loan interest rates is closely related to the development of industry and commerce and has already been instructed by the Ministry to the Central, China, and Communications Banks to gradually implement based on social and economic conditions. This reply is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Clarifies Doubts Regarding Stamp Tax on Duplicate Invoices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to Yu Feng, a dye and indigo business, clarifying that stamp tax should be affixed to duplicate invoices as receipts for goods. Your letter received on the 17th of this month, along with a sample of the original and duplicate invoices, inquiring about the method of affixing stamp tax, has been noted. The duplicate invoice you mentioned is stamped by the customer after receiving the goods and returned to your company for record. This clearly serves as a receipt for the goods. The original invoice is given by the seller to the customer for their records, while this one is given by the customer to the seller for theirs. Therefore, once the duplicate invoice is stamped by the customer and returned to the seller, it becomes a receipt issued by the customer to the seller. In other words, the act of the customer writing a separate receipt is the same as stamping the duplicate invoice as a receipt. It is merely a more convenient procedure. Therefore, the responsibility for affixing stamp tax to the duplicate invoice rests with the customer who affixes the stamp.</p>

Telegraph condolences to the students of various universities in Beiping and urge them to persevere in the spirit of national salvation. 5. Edit and publish a national salvation wall newspaper. 6. Publish a national crisis bi-weekly. 7. Actively promote the work of all departments.</p>
<p>The National Salvation Movement Association of the Zhengfeng College of Literature in this city, after its establishment the day before yesterday, immediately issued a circular expressing its admiration for the patriotic movement of the students in Beiping and pledging its sincerity and unwavering support. The Shanghai Medical College Student Union issued a notice stating: To all national agencies, newspapers, organizations, schools: The Beiping academic community has risen up to seek survival, vowing to oppose any form of autonomy or any disguised form of autonomy in North China. Our association pledges its support and hereby informs the nation.</p>
<p>The faculty and staff council of the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School issued a notice stating: The National Government is originally the autonomous government of our entire country. Anyone who undermines the unity of our country's sovereignty, regardless of the method they adopt or the name they use, will not be recognized by our entire nation.</p>
<p>All students of Daxia Middle School have felt extremely indignant since the student movement in Beiping occurred. On the 17th of this month, a general meeting of all students was convened in classroom 212 of the Qunxian Hall of our school, and the following important matters were resolved: 1. Send a telegram to the Beiping Student National Salvation Joint Association vowing to oppose the autonomy of North China to the death. 2. Elect Li Jingguo, Wang Wenlan, Zeng Tiexiong, Han Guangce, Qin Yongkang, Ma Zehong, Dang Weiya, Xu Zhimin, and fifteen others as directors.</p>
<p>Shanghai Fudan Experimental Middle School telegraphed: The country is unfortunate to suffer such calamities. There are actually heartless and insane people who borrow the name of public opinion and falsely claim autonomy. All of us Chinese people should be enraged and tear our eyes apart. The patriotic actions of the students in Beiping have been approved by the Ministry of Education as pure and out of sincere concern for the young students. It seems that they should not be falsely accused or arbitrarily arrested, lest they become a laughingstock at home and abroad. We dare to ask that the arrested students be released immediately and that it be guaranteed that there will be no similar incidents in the future.</p>
<p>The All-Staff and Student Representative Telegram from the Xinhuan Vocational School reads: In recent years, the country has suffered many calamities. Petty clowns are jumping around. The lost territory of the Northeast has not been recovered, and the rebellion in eastern Hebei continues. The great disaster of tomorrow is still brewing. Traitors are taking the opportunity to act wantonly, dividing the integrity of the country's territory and undermining the unity of the country's sovereignty. Now, anyone who dares to violate public opinion and divide the country's strength will be unanimously opposed by all of us compatriots, who vow to resist to the death.</p>
<p>The Jiashan Native Association in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday stating: Yin Rugeng, a traitor to the party and the country, invaded North China, shouting and creating disturbances, declaring the organization of a puppet regime, harming the country and the people. The people are filled with common outrage. All of us Chinese people should rise up and seek survival, preserve the integrity of our country's territory, maintain the sovereignty of the central government, unite in spirit, eliminate the roots of chaos. The future of the nation depends on this.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Orders Chamber of Commerce and Coal Industry Association to Stop Distributing Liujiang Coal</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Chinese-owned Liujiang Coal Mine Company's Heishanyao mining area in Linyu County, Hebei Province, was completely occupied by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Taiji Company, which also unauthorizedly exploited the mine and privately transported the coal it had stored to Shanghai by Japanese ships, for distribution by the Zhongfu Company opened by Ma Shaoquan.

<h3>Creditors' Meeting Held Yesterday After the Collapse of the Jiande Bank</h3>
<p>According to Dachong News Agency, after the Lunde Bank suspended business on June 6th of last year, it was declared bankrupt by the First Special District Court, which appointed accountant Li Ding and lawyer Shen Junru as bankruptcy administrators. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the court convened the second creditors' meeting at the Lake Society on Suzhou Road to discuss the bankruptcy proceedings. A reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present</p>
<p>Representatives of creditors, including Lu Shizun, Ma Yaoxian, Gu Wensheng, Shen Zongyong, Yu Yuanxiang, Lu Jiaquan, Wang Ruyao, Tao Ran, Liu Bingjun, Xu Liangzuo, Wei Haijiang, and others, totaling 452 people, were present, representing claims of 339,905.43 yuan (claims filed by 515 households totaling 387,565.47 yuan).</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>Judge Yu Lude of the First Special District Court and bankruptcy administrators Li Ding and Shen Junru served as the presidium. Judge Yu first reported that the previous creditors' meeting had not been convened due to insufficient numbers and claims. Then, accountant Li Ding reported on the receipt of assets, the total amount of registered claims, the debtor's list, and the total number of claims present at the meeting.</p>
<p>Election of Supervisors</p>
<p>Finally, a vote was held to elect supervisors. According to the law, the number of votes and the amount of claims must exceed one-half of the total present to be elected. The results of the ballot count showed that although Lu Shizun and Yu Yuanxiang had enough votes, their claims were slightly insufficient (but only by a small amount). Lu Jiaquan had insufficient votes and claims. Therefore, the election was declared invalid and would be held again. The bankruptcy administrator would consult the court and decide the next steps.</p>

<h3>Two Charity Groups Transport Relief Grain for Winter Relief in Zhongxiang</h3>
<p>The joint office of the World Red Swastika Society's Chinese Southeast Branches and the Renji Road Sino-Foreign Relief Association jointly organized the Yangtze River Disaster Relief, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, it was learned that the association received a report from disaster relief commissioners Li Tianzhen and Yu Jiashen, stating that they had procured a large amount of grain and transported it to the disaster area of Zhongxiang, Hubei Province, for winter relief. The report is recorded below: The tragic situation in the disaster area of Zhongxiang, Hubei Province, is no different from that of Tianmen. The county is covered with sand, several feet deep, preventing the sowing of wheat seeds. Local grain and wheat are scarce, and the victims have money but nowhere to buy, their suffering is a hundred times greater than in other areas. In view of this, the Association has specially procured a large amount of grain and wheat in Hankou and urged the use of 30 civilian boats and 3 steamers to transport 5,000 piculs of broad beans and 6,000 pieces of cotton clothing, which were shipped a few days ago, sailing up the Xiang River. The Water Police Bureau also sent a warship to escort them. Once the relief grain arrives, it is planned to first release it in the six Liang districts, and the remaining districts will be released according to the decisions. It is planned to allocate more than 10,000 yuan to Yichang and Shashi. However, during this winter relief period, urgent appeals are being received from various places, and the relief funds are insufficient. It is still hoped that you will appeal to all sectors and raise more relief funds for assistance. After receiving the telegram, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association first allocated 1,000 sets of relief clothing and immediately raised relief funds to be remitted to the disaster area for assistance. In addition to the 3,000 sets of cotton clothing and 4,000 yuan in relief funds that have already been allocated, the Red Swastika Society is continuing to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Qualification Investigation of Taxpaying Chinese Residents in the Public Concession Extended</h3>

<h3>"National Products Year for Citizens" - First Preparatory Meeting to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the National Products Movement Committee, the Chinese National Manufacturers' Federation, and the Shanghai People's National Products Consumption Association have held a joint meeting and decided to designate next year as "National Products Year for Citizens." The first preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 20th) at 4:00 PM. The notice issued yesterday by the convener, the Citizens' Federation, is as follows: "We hereby inform you that advocating for national products is the duty of every citizen. In recent years, foreign goods have flooded the market, and the sales of national products have been declining day by day. Looking ahead, it is truly distressing. If we do not quickly seek self-salvation, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, after deliberation at a joint meeting, it has been decided to designate the year of the Republic of China's 25th year as National Products Year for Citizens, in order to alert our compatriots and prevent further leakage of wealth, in the hope of achieving a miraculous recovery. It has also been decided to hold a National Products Year Movement Assembly on New Year's Day of the 25th year, with representatives from various organizations participating in the preparations. We have scheduled the first preparatory meeting to be held at 4:00 PM on the 20th of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the direction of the movement. As this matter concerns the patriotic movement, we sincerely hope that your esteemed organization will participate unanimously, send representatives to attend and deliberate, and join us in this great endeavor."</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Advocates for Rickshaw Operators: Transportation Committee's Fines are Legally Unfounded</h3>
<p>A Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Demands Court Adjudication, Supplementary Registration of Rickshaw Pullers, and Direct Collection of Mutual Aid Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: "We hereby inform you that the registered rickshaw operators of the Public Concession, Jin Lin, Bao Zhenhuang, Yuan Jiakang, Zhu Hongzhang, Yuan Yilin, and 40 others, have jointly submitted a petition to this Association, stating: 'Regarding the matter of the petition, since the establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee by the Municipal Council last year, the implementation of the new regulations has become increasingly severe. They are nitpicking in every matter and have spared no effort. We will not dwell on the past. Recently, more than one hundred households have been mistakenly charged excessive rickshaw rental fees, fined, and had their licenses confiscated, and this continues unabated. In this situation, regardless of the truth, with abuse of power and arbitrary decisions, how can rickshaw operators accept this? This is the first point. Furthermore, rickshaw pullers are essential for the operation of rickshaws. Previously, due to an insufficient number of registered rickshaw pullers, we requested the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to conduct supplementary registrations, but this has been ignored. If the armbands of the rickshaw pullers are inspected, the rickshaws will inevitably be stopped, which will affect our business. This is the second point. Furthermore, the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society is not under the control of the Municipal Council, yet the membership fees must be paid in advance in order to obtain a license. This is incomprehensible. According to a letter from the rickshaw pullers' association, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee controls the mutual aid society and its management is poor. Therefore, all future membership fees have been suspended. Moreover, according to a letter from all the contractors, they refuse to collect the mutual aid society fees on behalf of the society. Given this, if the rickshaw pullers do not recognize it and the contractors refuse to collect it, the rickshaw operators will inevitably have to pay in advance and suffer losses, which is unbearable. This is the third point. Other issues include rickshaw pullers who still owe rent, yet the agents' receipts are forced upon the contractors for signature, and if there is any violation, the licenses are confiscated for one or two months to force recognition and payment. (Receipts, penalty slips, and photos are attached.) Their illegal and coercive actions are endless. Our fellow industry operators, regarding the above cases, convened a general meeting of all rickshaw owners in the Special District on the 2nd of this month. After discussion, representatives were selected to negotiate with the Rickshaw Affairs Committee several times, but to no avail. The rickshaw operators are facing imminent bankruptcy and are filled with indignation, vowing not to stop until the goal of improvement is achieved. In desperation, they have jointly submitted this document, requesting your esteemed association to consider the oppression and suffering endured by the taxpayers, uphold justice, and argue reasonably, forwarding this letter to the Municipal Council, urging them to quickly improve their policies and disband the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, so that the rickshaw industry will not go bankrupt, which would be extremely fortunate.' The Association, regarding the illegal actions of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, sent a special letter to your Council on the 13th of this month, urging you to quickly rectify the situation. Now, regarding the matters stated in the submission, we specially and solemnly state three points to your Council: 1. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee's confiscation of private licenses and coercion of rickshaw operators to pay fines (or euphemistically call them donations) have absolutely no legal basis. Rickshaw operators have not only no obligation to pay, but also have the absolute necessity to refuse payment. We request your Council to immediately order the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to return all confiscated licenses so that they can resume business. If there are indeed cases of excessive rickshaw rental fees, your Council should file a lawsuit in court in accordance with the law, so that both parties can gather, be interrogated, and the matter can be handled. 2. There are not enough registered rickshaw pullers. According to the first point in the letter from Rickshaw Affairs Committee Chairman Massey in response to rickshaw operator representative Yin Zhiling on November 28th of last year, 'If the Committee confirms that a registered rickshaw puller has had his license revoked due to violations, death, misconduct, or has permanently left Shanghai and cannot pull a rickshaw, the Committee will allow the rickshaw owner to introduce a rickshaw puller for registration as a replacement.' We request your Council to instruct the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to continue supplementary registrations in accordance with the aforementioned point, in order to maintain the rickshaw operators' business. 3. The payment of mutual aid society fees by rickshaw operators on behalf of the pullers is an act of forced obligation. Previously, rickshaw pullers were not registered, and direct collection could be said to be practically difficult. But now that rickshaw pullers have been issued licenses by your Council, it is no longer difficult to collect fees based on the licenses. Moreover, your Council allows rickshaw operators to collect seven cents per day, but requires them to pay 1.5 yuan per month. On the one hand, some may think there is a surplus to gain, but on the other hand, rickshaw operators cannot bear the losses. Changing to direct collection should be reduced to five cents per day, and the rickshaw pullers who actually pull rickshaws can be identified through this collection, so that there will be no more nominal rickshaw pullers who have licenses but do not pull rickshaws. We urge your Council to implement the above three points as soon as possible, to avoid major problems. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association to Officially Open in January Next Year</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to handle the prize-linked savings business and has allocated 5 million yuan to establish the Central Savings Association, which will take over the special savings of the Sino-French Savings Society and the China Industrial Bank. Currently, the bureau has announced the registration of Type A and Type B depositors of the Sino-French Savings Society. After the deadline of the 15th of this month, the bureau, in order to facilitate depositors, will make special arrangements for those who go to register within the next few days. The number of registrations will be settled before the end of the year, and a plan will be formulated and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The Savings Association is scheduled to officially open in January of next year.</p>
<h3>The Complete Publication of the Photolithographic Edition of the Song Dynasty Qisha Tripitaka</h3>
<p>The Song Dynasty Qisha Edition of the Tripitaka was carved at the Yansheng Monastery in Qisha, Pingjiang Prefecture during the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty. After more than 700 years of transmission, it has become the world's only surviving copy. The original edition was carefully collated and exquisitely carved. The Shanghai Photolithographic Edition of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Association (located at 714 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai) obtained it from Shaanxi, photographed it, and printed it. They also sought out missing volumes from Shanxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and northern Sichuan, and supplemented them one by one. It is printed with high-quality Chinese Lian Shi paper and bound with gold facing, for a total of 593 volumes. It has now been completely published. The initial printing was only 500 copies, and they have all been sold out domestically and abroad. The Association is about to close down, but there are still requests from various places to continue purchasing. They have reluctantly negotiated with those who had previously subscribed to allow them to release a few copies. In the short term, they will still offer the original preferential price of 525 yuan per set, in order to fulfill their Buddhist vows and satisfy the distant desires. This is a very convenient time, as payment allows immediate acquisition of the Tripitaka. However, the number of sets is limited, and sales will stop once they are sold out. Those who wish to purchase must contact them quickly.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Maritime Accidents of Two Seagoing Vessels</h3>
<p>Hua Shun Discharges Cargo for Rescue</p>
<p>The Hua Shun, a vessel belonging to the Yitai Company and managed by the Huasheng Shipping Company, was transporting coal from Pukou to Guangdong this time. On the morning of the 17th, the ship reached the Second Sandbar outside Huangpu Port in Guangzhou. Due to the receding tide, the ship ran aground. A telegram was sent to Shanghai reporting the incident, originally hoping that the ship could free itself during the high tide that evening. However, yesterday, Yitai received another telegram from Guangdong stating that the Hua Shun had become stuck in the shallows due to its large size and heavy load, and that it could not free itself during the high tide. Yitai deemed the matter urgent, so they telegraphed their Guangdong agent, Ruiyuan, instructing them to send a special representative to inspect the Hua Shun. If it could not free itself automatically, they would have to quickly dispatch a barge to the Second Sandbar to unload all the cargo from the Hua Shun, allowing the ship to float and find a way to tow it to safety.</p>
<p>Bei Fu's Engine Room Flooded</p>
<p>The Bei Fu, a vessel belonging to the Northern Company, was struck by the imported Datong Xingshun. The outer hull of the Bei Fu's third hold was damaged. The company subsequently received a telegram from Tianjin stating that the Bei Fu's third hold was flooded. Tianjin has dispatched a vessel to unload the coal from the Bei Fu, and then repair the damaged hull. However, upon further inspection, the engine room and the aft hold of the Bei Fu were also flooded, and the situation was quite urgent. It has been decided to unload all the coal from the holds and then repair the damaged holds.</p>
<h3>Using Fake Bank Notes to Swindle Cloth</h3>
<p>Chen Shunsuo's Crimes Cannot Escape Justice</p>
<p>Chen Shunsuo, a native of Zhejiang, purchased 100 bolts of twill cloth from the Guangyuanxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 35 Yuxing Lane, Nanjing Road, the other day. He paid with a Shanghai Bankers' Association member Yichang Money Shop bank note, with a face value of 497.50 yuan. Because Chen Shunsuo looked like a businessman, wearing glasses and well-dressed, he did not seem like a swindler. As a result, the cloth was handed over to a cart to be taken away. Afterwards, the factory tried to cash the note at the Yichang Money Shop and learned that it was a fake. Thereupon, they dispatched employees Dai Pingpo, Bian Shizhong, and others to search for him. Yesterday morning, they found the swindler Chen Shunsuo in the Nanshi district, handed him over to the patrol police, and escorted him to the 16th Precinct. A business card of Chen Shunsuo was found on him, printed with the words "Hongda Cotton Cloth Store, 378 Beijing Road." He was then escorted to the third section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Because the case involved a criminal matter, Chen Shunsuo was transferred to the District Court in the afternoon with a written document, requesting that he be tried according to the law.</p>
<h3>An Incident of Dispute Over Booty Arises from Picking Mud and Collecting Packages</h3>
<p>Xu Zuogui's Whereabouts are Unknown, the Detective Team Must Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>A section of the Suzhou Creek in Beixinjing, near Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai, has been dredged, and the excavated mud has been piled up on both banks. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has dispatched a large number of workers to remove it. The other day, at around 3:00 PM, seven Jiangbei workers, Xu Maoren, Xu Zuogui, Jiang Guilan, Gao Lianxi, Ge Jiujin, Wu Huaijin, and Chou Laotouzi, were working near Beixinjing when they suddenly found a large paper package in the mud. Xu Zuogui took it out, and it seemed quite heavy. Just as everyone was about to open it, Xu Zuogui immediately said not to make any noise, to avoid being noticed by others. If there was any extra money, it would be distributed fairly. After speaking, he took the opportunity to leave. The other day, in the afternoon, they agreed to go to the Gaosheng Bathhouse in Caojiadu to bathe. Xu Zuogui took out 70 yuan and distributed 28 yuan to Xu Maoren, 22 yuan to Jiang Guilan, and 20 yuan to Gao Lianxi. Just as everyone was distributing the money and talking secretly, Yin Dafu, a Jiangbei native from Yancheng who was sitting nearby, overheard them and immediately reported it to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau Detective Squad leaders Zhuang Dexiu and Xin Jingsheng. They immediately led Squad Leader Liu Bingyuan, Liu Shaoqing, detectives Su Ruiting, Gao Fushan, Zhang Zuoxian, and Wang Zhusheng to investigate and arrest them. Xu Maoren, Jiang Guilan, and Gao Lianxi were arrested, but Xu Zuogui had escaped beforehand. After questioning, they confessed to the above, and said that they did not know what was in the package because Xu Zuogui had snatched it away and they had not opened it. They only said that there were two guns inside, one fake and one real, and they did not know how much legal currency there was. Today, they were gathered to distribute the money and were arrested on the spot. The investigation squad leader Zhuang has strictly ordered the arrest of Xu Zuogui and others in order to thoroughly investigate the true origin of the package, what was in the package, and whether there are any other circumstances.</p>

<h3>The Zhabei New and Used Goods Public Market Held its Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Zhabei area of Shanghai is vast, but the market has not yet recovered since the impact of the January 28th Incident. Furthermore, the world's economic recession has spread to East Asia. The general unemployed population is crying out in hunger and cold, with nowhere to turn. Therefore, in June of this year, the establishment of the Zhabei New and Used Goods Public Market was initiated to help unemployed civilians. The opening ceremony was held at the market at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 300 people attended, including Guan Hongbin, Zhao Xiaofeng, Li Shoupeng, Wu Zhenming, Wang Yutang, Ren Tongxin, Zhang Zhifang, Xu Dingchen, Song Yaoqing, Gong Yunlong, Du Chunxun, Zhang Yansen, Kang Jiezhi, Wang Zhiguang, Wang Yaoting, Zhang Jiangong, Wang Bingcheng, guests, and stall owners. The venue was decorated in a very grand manner, and the market was surrounded by bamboo fences, which were also very neat.</p>
<p>Assembly Chairman</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaofeng, Song Yaoqing, Li Shoupeng, Wang Yaoting, and Du Chunxun were elected as the chairman group. Wu Zhenming was the master of ceremonies, and Wang Bingcheng was the recorder. At around 9:00 AM, the meeting was opened with a bell. After performing the ritual, Chairman Du Chunxun first reported on the</p>
<p>Purpose of the Meeting</p>
<p>He stated briefly, "Today is the first day of the opening of our market. Everyone should understand why we are running this market. Because the Zhabei area, since the January 28th War, has suffered imperialist aggression. The entire Chinese market and housing have been turned into scorched earth, leaving our general unemployed civilians with nowhere to turn. Furthermore, the market is in a slump and the economy is in decline. Witnessing these civilians continuing in this way, we fear that unexpected actions will occur. Therefore, we have gathered comrades to organize a new and used goods, martial arts, and entertainment public market, directly creating livelihoods for civilians and indirectly creating happiness for society. Therefore, we are holding this opening ceremony today, so that everyone can better understand the meaning of organizing this market." Next, Mr. Song Yaoqing reported on the</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>"Today is the first opening ceremony of our market. We are very pleased that everyone has come to participate. However, this market has been organized for almost half a year, and we have gone through many difficulties and setbacks. We have worked diligently to get to this first day. The opening has been delayed for several days because the procedures for various aspects have not been completed, so we have not held the ceremony. From today onwards, we hope that everyone who sells and buys in this market will first abide by the rules and second obey the market regulations, and must not arbitrarily cause trouble or obstruct business. If there are any areas in this market that need to be improved, please report them to the founders' office as much as possible, so that this market can be immediately reformed. These few points are what I hope for from everyone." Afterwards, various guests gave speeches in succession. The length is omitted here. At around 12:00 noon, the ceremony was completed, and the adjournment was announced.</p>
<h3>Impoverished and Bored, He Came up with a Bizarre Idea: Extorting Money from a Monk at the Water Immortal Temple, Zhang Xinru Falsely Claimed that his Daughter Died from Taking a Magical Potion, Using a Tabloid to Publish the News, the Enraged Monk Reported the Case to the Police</h3>
<p>Fanghua, a Shaoxing monk residing at 26 Yonghua Lane, Milu Road, Fangbang Road in the French Concession, established the Water Immortal Temple, a branch of the Datong Temple, accepting Buddhist rituals and offering pure Yang idols, dispensing magical potions to those seeking them. The business was doing well. A fourth-floor pavilion at 37 Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao housed the Social News, a four-page tabloid founded by Chen Xinfu, alias Xueyu (25 years old), from Pudong. Chen himself served as manager, editor-in-chief, and treasurer. Ma Wenkui (22 years old), from Chaozhou, served as associate editor and Qin Zhizhen (22 years old), from Suzhou, served as advertising director, and Qin Ying was the distribution director. Zhang Xinru (24 years old), from Kunshan, worked as an advertising broker. Recently, due to</p>
<p>Extreme Poverty and Boredom,</p>
<p>He came up with a bizarre idea, devising a plan where he had a daughter, eight years old, who fell ill and sought a magical potion from the Water Immortal Temple, a branch of the Datong Temple. Using the wording "died after taking the potion," he colluded with Ma Wenkui, Qin Zhizhen, Chen Xin, also known as Chen Xueyu, and outsiders Lu Zhenya (23 years old, from Kunshan), Ni Dade (from Wuxi), and Dai Shangwu (25 years old, from Jiangxi) to extort money from Fanghua, the monk at the Water Immortal Temple of the Datong Temple. First, on the 18th of last month, Ma Wenkui and Qin Zhizhen went to the Water Immortal Temple of the Datong Temple. Ma claimed to Monk Fanghua that a child surnamed Zhang had died after taking his fake medicine and that he had reported it to the French police. Ma said, "I am Bao Tan Zhang Youpei, sent to investigate. I order you to come to the police station with me to await interrogation." Ma and the others took Fanghua to Room 3 of the</p>
<p>Jinling Hotel</p>
<p>Located at Taiyuan Lane on West Xilaihuo Street. They summoned Zhang Xinru and the others to the scene and began negotiating with Fanghua, demanding 1,600 yuan. Because Fanghua was unable to afford it, he repeatedly pleaded. The amount was gradually reduced from 500 yuan to 50 yuan before an agreement was reached. At the time, because he had no money, they made an agreement for future payment. Fanghua only took out one silver dollar and ten small silver coins as payment for the room before being released. After returning to the temple, because he still had no way to handle the matter, Ma Wenkui wrote a news report himself about the Water Immortal Temple's fake medicine harming people and Zhang Xinru filing a lawsuit in the Special No. 2 Court. It was published in the Social News on the 21st and 27th of last month. He also wrote a commentary,</p>
<p>"A Few Words on Fake Medicine."</p>
<p>After the manuscript was published in the newspaper, he mailed the newspaper to Monk Fanghua. After reading it, Fanghua felt that he had been slandered and blackmailed for no reason, damaging his reputation. Unwilling to endure this, he reported the case to the French police. Detective Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, Detective Liu Jinrong, and others arrested Ma Wenkui, alias Zhang Youpei, Qin Zhizhen, Zhang Xinru, Lu Lingya, Chen Xin, alias Chen Xueyu, Ni Dade, and Dai Shangwu, and went to the Social News office, and pulled out three copies of Ma Wenkui's handwritten news and gossip drafts, as well as two copies of the newspaper from November 21st and 27th, and a note from Ma Wenkui to Monk Fanghua. They were sent to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Xiong interrogated the case with the prosecutor's office lawyer Yao Zhaohui.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Case</p>
<p>According to articles 346 and 310 of the criminal law, the defendants were prosecuted for crimes of intimidation, extortion, and defamation. The plaintiff, Fanghua, went to Ningbo for business and was represented by the temple manager Yao Xiangqing, who testified. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng to defend them. The court ordered the defendants to be interrogated separately. Ma Wenkui confessed that he was invited by Zhang Xinru to the Jinling Hotel, the scheme to extort money was devised by Zhang Xinru, and he did not know it was false. Therefore, he published the manuscript in the newspaper and did not pretend to be a detective to intimidate the Water Immortal Temple. Zhang Xinru confessed that he did it because his mother was sick and impoverished. He thought of Lu Zhenya previously mentioning that his cousin died from taking medicine from the Water Immortal Temple. So he fabricated that his daughter died from taking the medicine, and colluded to extort money, only asking for 30 yuan, and there was no matter of 1,600 yuan. Qin Zhizhen's testimony was the same as Ma's. The other four defendants all gave statements shirking responsibility and</p>
<p>Denying Collusion</p>
<p>In the extortion, the Jinling Hotel tea house worker Shen Boxiang was summoned to testify with the registration book. According to his testimony, a person wearing an overcoat came to open the room, paid one yuan, and wrote the name Ni Dade. But he did not know who Ni was. There were many people who came. He was asked if the defendant Chen Xin was the one who opened the room. Shen scrutinized Chen's face and answered, "Yes." However, Chen firmly denied it. The plaintiff Fanghua's representative Yao Xiangqing (62 years old, from Suzhou) testified that the first defendant, Ma Wenkui, came to the temple with 23 people, and twice forced Fanghua to leave and intimidated him. After the interrogation, the court considered the facts of the case to be clear, and ordered that after the arguments, the case would be concluded and a date would be set for sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Abandonment after Seduction: A Waitress Files a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Tao A-Jin Denies Cohabitation, But Jurisdiction is Still in Question</p>
<p>Wu Zhufu, a native of Nanjing, has been a teacher in his hometown. He is over sixty years old and still has no son, only a daughter named Meizhen, who is nineteen years old. Because his family is not wealthy and his teaching income cannot support their daily expenses, he had to find another source of income. In March of this year, Wu Zhufu brought his daughter Meizhen to Shanghai and temporarily resided at 15 Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession, to await opportunities. Until before the Dragon Boat Festival, Wu heard that the Tianyunlou at Wing On Company was recruiting waitresses. Wu felt that it was a time to promote women's employment, so he could not be bound by old etiquette. He had Meizhen work as a waitress, and Wu Zhufu also returned home to resume his old profession. Unexpectedly, Tao A-Jin, the owner of Tao Renji Woodshop at 132 De'an Lane, North Shaanxi Road, a local man who was known to be frivolous, went to Tianyunlou to watch plays from time to time. In July of this year, he met Wu Meizhen. Under the pretense of enjoying tea, they exchanged affections. After several visits, love blossomed, and from September 1st, they rented a house at 17 Shuixiang Lane, north of Xinzha Bridge, and lived together as lovers, appearing as a couple. Meizhen also suddenly stopped menstruating and became pregnant. After a month, because the residence was inconvenient, they moved to the upstairs of the Dajixiang Restaurant next to the Nanjing Grand Theater on Rue Wagner in the French Concession and continued to live together. Wu's daughter also thought she had found a good husband and a lifelong partner, so she quit her job and served him. Unexpectedly, from last month, Tao A-Jin suddenly disappeared from Wu's daughter's place, causing Wu's daughter to pawn almost everything. She had to tell her father the truth in a letter. Wu Zhufu was very dissatisfied when he heard this, so he came to Shanghai and hired a lawyer to send a letter to Tao, but he ignored it. He then commissioned lawyer Chen Wen to file a lawsuit against Tao A-Jin in the Special No. 1 Court under articles 240, 131 and 132 of the Criminal Law, and also filed a private suit asking for compensation of 2,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The plaintiff Wu Zhufu did not arrive, and Wu Meizhen testified as before. The defendant Tao A-Jin testified that in June of this year, he went to Wing On Company to play with friends and met Wu. Once, he went to the inn with her and had illicit relations, paying 5 yuan, but there was no matter of renting a house and living together. Judge Jiang felt that there were still doubts about the jurisdiction of this case, and changed the hearing date to this Friday.</p>
<h3>Woman Imprisoned for Drug Case, Tearfully Bids Farewell to Eight-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Girl Taken by Relatives, Heartbreaking Scene of Separation</p>
<p>Zhang Ziying, a chief detective of the Special Task Force of the French Concession Police, recently learned that someone was secretly hiding the drug morphine at No. 285, Da'an Lane, Xiafei Road (opposite Songshan Road Police Station). The morphine was being secretly transported from Sichuan to Shanghai for sale. At 3 p.m. that afternoon, he, along with Deputy Detective Qin Youyu, Detective Ma Yizhi, and others, rushed to the address to search the premises. Because there was a rental sign on the front door of the house, and the doors were closed, the detectives pretended to be interested in renting the house and knocked on the door to gain entry. They then thoroughly searched the premises. They found twenty-four bags of coarse yellow morphine, weighing twelve pounds and worth more than three thousand yuan, hidden in the bedding of a Sichuanese widow named Du Hengfen (also known as Du Li, 44 years old, her husband Du Zhiheng, who ran a paint and paper business, died on June 1st of the previous year). This drug still needed to be refined before it could be sold. Because the woman had an eight-year-old daughter named Minhua and there was no one to take care of her, both mother and daughter were taken to the police station along with the drugs. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping conducted a preliminary hearing. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, requesting a postponement of the investigation and the arrest of fugitives. Detective Zhang Ziying then reported on the arrest of the defendant and the search process, and presented the seized drugs to the court. When questioned, the defendant Du Hengfen stated that her husband was deceased and that a friend of her husband's, Mr. Chen, had sent the items to her house. At that time, an old woman surnamed Wang, a relative and fellow villager of the defendant, arrived and offered to take care of the child. When questioned, the defendant hesitated. The court ordered a further hearing on the 23rd, and the defendant was remanded in custody. The girl was temporarily sent to the Xinpu Yutang Orphanage. The girl was unwilling to leave her mother, and according to her relative, the old woman surnamed Wang, the defendant also had a wife and family in Yichang. She offered to take care of the child. After the court questioned the defendant, she finally agreed to let her relative temporarily take care of her daughter. The judge approved it, and the defendant tearfully bid farewell to her daughter before being escorted to the detention center by the police. Her daughter was taken away by relatives, but was still reluctant to leave her mother, a truly heartbreaking scene.</p>
<h3>Smoke and Gambling Den Case at the Jue Lu Hotel Sentenced</h3>
<p>Ji Zeng and Others Appeal the Original Judgment, Trial Results in Original Sentences</p>
<p>Ji Zengshou, a well-known Shanghai gangster nicknamed "Little Collapsed Cake," previously opened a smoking den and gambling establishment with Hong Longsheng and others in rooms 108 and 82 of the Jue Lu Hotel at 450 Xizang Road, openly gathering crowds for gambling, skimming profits, and providing opium for consumption, generating substantial income. This was discovered by Liu Yaying and Lu Dagong, Chinese detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station, who secretly arrested Ji Zengshou and Hong Longsheng. Along with gamblers and opium smokers, they were handed over to the First Special District Local Court, which sentenced Ji Zengshou and Hong Longsheng each to one year and six months imprisonment for the two crimes of running a smoking den and gambling establishment, and fined them 300 yuan each. Ji and Hong, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, hoping to escape punishment. However, Gan Jingxian, the police lawyer, argued that the original judgment was entirely appropriate and requested that the appeal be rejected and the original judgment upheld to deter criminals. The Second Branch of the High Court concluded its investigation and yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua announced the verdict, upholding the original sentence of one year and six months imprisonment for Ji and Hong, and a fine of 300 yuan each. If the fines were not paid, they would be commuted to labor at a rate of three yuan per day. After the judgment, the police escorted the two convicts, Ji Zengshou and Hong Longsheng, to the Western Prison for confinement.</p>
<h3>Chen Bingwei Fined for Practicing Medicine Without a License</h3>
<p>Result of Police Appeal</p>
<p>Chen Bingwei, a Cantonese man, acquired some medical skills from his brother and then proclaimed himself a "medical doctor," specializing in treating venereal diseases, skin conditions, and hemorrhoids. He also falsely used the name of a Westerner, James Duncan, and advertised at No. 623 Sichuan Road to deceive patients. After investigation by the Public Concession Police, it was found that Chen had neither a medical license nor had he graduated from any medical school, yet he claimed to be a medical doctor, which constituted fraud. Therefore, he was sued for fraud in the First Special District Court. The trial resulted in Chen being declared innocent. The Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Ru Baoyi. The interrogation has concluded, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with Associate Judges Zhao and Zhou, opened a criminal court and announced the verdict: the original verdict was overturned, and Chen Bingwei was fined 200 yuan for repeatedly using fraudulent means to induce people to hand over their property. If he cannot pay the fine, he shall be sentenced to labor at the rate of two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>110-Year-Old Woman Collapses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hospital Treatment Expected to Lead to Recovery</p>
<p>An old woman surnamed Zhang from Shandong Province, aged 110, came to Shanghai with her 38-year-old grandson because her hometown was hit by a flood. She sought out her nephew's grandson, who worked at the Public Security Bureau, carrying only five yuan for travel expenses and a letter with her nephew's grandson's address. Unexpectedly, both items were lost upon arrival in Shanghai. She resorted to begging for food. At 2 a.m. the previous morning, she collapsed on the side of the road. Her grandson informed the patrol police, who took the old woman to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, according to the hospital doctors, her recovery is expected.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Commercial Press's Color Printing Equipment</h3>
<p>Shanghai Plant Equipped with Various New Machines, Hong Kong and Peiping Branches Also Have Excellent Facilities</p>
<p>The Commercial Press is a giant in China's printing industry. Before January 28th, the company had a main factory in Zhabei Baoshan Road, covering an area of over one hundred acres. It also had printing plants in Hong Kong and Peiping. It was always the first to adopt the world's latest printing technologies and machines, with everything available. In 1932, the main factory was destroyed. The company's Hong Kong and Peiping branches expanded and added new printing machines based on their existing equipment. They are now well-known factories in the north and south of China's printing industry. When it resumed operations, the company successively established plate-making and printing factories in Shanghai on a large scale. The volume of production surpassed that of any other printing factory in the country. Later, recognizing the lack of fine printing in Shanghai, in the spring of 1933, it established a lithographic plant on Qinhuangdao Road, purchasing new machines and adopting modern equipment. All types of printing, such as offset, photogravure, collotype, three-color, and relief printing, were available. Based on its forty years of experience, it strived for excellence in technology. However, due to the company's numerous needs, such as the Hundred-Na Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories, Rare Treasures of the Siku Quanshu, rubbings of steles, couplets, illustrations, wall charts, etc., all of which were printed by this factory, it was unable to fully serve the outside world, which was a pity in the eyes of many. It is now heard that the company has found a way to expand the factory so that it can undertake a large number of external printing orders, and it has also received various valuable securities and color printing orders, which are currently in progress.</p>
<h3>Record of the General Assembly of the Local Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association held its 35th General Assembly on the 16th to welcome new members and invited Mr. Chen Lansheng and Mr. Zhang Fayao to give speeches. Those present included Du Yuesheng, Ren Jinping, Zhu Wenqi, Wang Zhixin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Chen Binhe, Wang Kuiheng, Zhu Xuefan, Huang Renzhi, Feng Bingnan, Ren Shigang, Pan Yangyao, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Xiaolin, Yu Yefeng, Liu Weijun, Xu Kecheng, Pan Zhiwen, Yang Weiyu, Lin Kanghou, Xu Caicheng, Wang Boyuan, Qu Shao Yi, Mu Ouchu, Hu Junzhuang, Zhu Qianqiao, Hu Junqiu, Jiang Wenyu, Xu Jiqing, Kui Yanfang, Xu Yongzuo, Yan Fuqing, Guo Bingwen, He Dekui, Liu Hongsheng, Gao Dajing, Guo Shun, Qin Daishi, Jin Runxiang, Chen Zheqing, Xu Xinliu, Zou Bingwen, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, and others. President Du Yuesheng announced the opening of the meeting and welcomed the new members Wang Yansong, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Jiguang, Jin Runxiang, and others. After that, they discussed and passed several important proposals, including moving the association's premises to the fourth floor of the China &amp; South Sea Bank and the budget for the first half of the 25th year. Temporarily, Mr. Pan Yangyao proposed promoting domestic goods, and Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, and Pan Yangyao were appointed to discuss and implement the proposal. Subsequently, the chairman stood up and introduced Mr. Chen Lansheng to speak on the currency system. Mr. Chen is an economic expert and currently the chairman of the Currency System Committee. He spoke in great detail about the causes of currency system reform and the benefits and disadvantages of currency inflation and deflation. The chairman then reported that Mr. Zhang Xiaolin's son, Fayao, had returned to the country after studying in France for eight years and obtaining a doctorate in political economy. The association had invited him to join, and they welcomed him to the meeting to speak about the political and economic situation abroad. Dr. Zhang immediately stood up and briefly said that economic problems are extremely complex. The current unrest in the world is caused by the remnants of the European War. At that time, economic warfare led to military warfare, causing great losses to all. The leaders of various countries seem to have just awakened. At the peace conference, only political issues were resolved, while economic issues remained a matter of contention and mutual encroachment. China has been affected by this, and its economy has been very unstable in recent years. The only way to save it is to increase production and expand foreign trade. Fayao plans to write a more detailed report on his research findings abroad in the next month or two, to seek advice from experts. The audience applauded frequently, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>A Certain National Demands Cashing of Discontinued National Treasury Bonds, Stolen by Fang Zhenwu's Subordinates, Resulting in a Portion Falling into the Hands of a Certain National, Liu Xiucheng, Who Handled the Sale, is Arrested</h3>
<p>During the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, when Fang Zhenwu was serving in Wuhan, he was approved by the National Government to issue a type of national treasury bond, totaling 90 million yuan, for sale in the market. However, these treasury bonds have now been officially discontinued by the National Government and are gradually being withdrawn. Unexpectedly, several staff members of Fang Zhenwu's military supply department secretly stole 2.5 million yuan of these national treasury bonds and privately entrusted people to sell them in succession. A portion of the treasury bonds fell into the hands of a certain national, who recently took the bonds to the Central Bank and demanded redemption. The bank informed him that these treasury bonds had long been discontinued by the government and could not be redeemed, resulting in no outcome. Meanwhile, the bank reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance, which ordered an investigation and learned the details of the previous situation. It secretly ordered the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to investigate. In recent days, the police arrested several suspects, including Xi Yuzhen, Miao Zizhong, and Zhang Heqin, at the Wanyuanxiang Paper Store on Mingguo Road in the French Concession, and seized 300,000 yuan of national treasury bonds, which were transferred to the headquarters for detention and investigation. Zhang Heqin confessed that Liu Xiucheng (aka Xiucheng) from Zhenjiang, who handled the sale of the treasury bonds, was hiding at No. 17, Nanxiangfu Lane, No. 154, Kader Road in the Public Concession. The headquarters sent Inspector Xu Pengfei to the First Special Court to apply for an arrest warrant and search warrant. Together with Detective Ye Yushan from the Xinzha Police Station, they secretly went to the address and arrested Liu Xiucheng. At that time, Liu still claimed to be Liu Xiucheng. After detectives searched and found many letters, not only did they state Liu Xiucheng's name, but they were all about the negotiations between the arrested suspects and Liu regarding the sale of treasury bonds. Liu finally had nothing to say and was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the representative lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, did not object to the headquarters' request for transfer. Subsequently, Xu Pengfei, the inspector of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, submitted two documents requesting transfer and questioned Liu Xiucheng. Liu confessed to introducing the sale of treasury bonds and claimed that he only earned commissions and did not know that the treasury bonds had been discontinued or that they had been stolen. He also hired a lawyer to appear in court and oppose the transfer.

<h3>Car Affairs Department Bids for Loading and Unloading Work at Wuxi Station, Both Railway Unions Express Opinions</h3>
<p>On the 11th of this month, the two railway bureaus advertised for bids for the loading and unloading work at Wuxi Station, which caused panic among all the loading and unloading workers at Wuxi Station. On the 14th, they sent representatives, including Chen Renrui, to the Party Headquarters, the Railway Bureau, and the Union to petition, requesting that they be allowed to contract the work, following the precedents of Shangbei and McLean Road, Suzhou, and other stations, to avoid exploitation by contractors. They also submitted a petition to the Ministry of Railways. The details were recorded in the newspapers on the 16th. On the 18th, the local newspapers also published an interview with the person in charge of the Railway Bureau regarding the reorganization of the loading and unloading work at Wuxi Station, suspecting that the station's joint request was to support the former contractors Meng Jinsun and Tao Ziming. According to the spokesperson of the two railway unions yesterday, it is true that Meng Jinsun and Tao Ziming, the foreman, exploited the workers in the loading and unloading work at Wuxi Station. The originally stipulated loading and unloading fee was 19 cents per ton, but Meng Jinsun took 5 cents alone, and the foreman Tao Ziming took another 2 cents, leaving the workers with only 12 cents. The workers could not bear the exploitation and petitioned the Ministry of Railways and the Railway Bureau for relief. Recently, the Railway Bureau was able to resolutely cancel Meng Jinsun's contract and recruit others to contract, which is beneficial to the workers' welfare and business reputation. However, the Railway Bureau's use of the public bidding system seems questionable. Has the Railway Bureau limited the eligibility of the previous contractors Meng Jinsun and foreman Tao Ziming, who exploited the workers, to bid in the public advertisement for bids? Can the contractor who comes from the bidding be familiar with the local situation and conform to the local environment? The target of the bidding is the loading and unloading fee, and of course, the level of the loading and unloading fee will determine its retention. Can the fee determined by the bidding be suitable for the local situation? If there is any doubt about the above points, the result will be contrary to the original intention of the Railway Bureau. According to Articles 2 and 9 of the Measures for Contracting the Loading and Unloading of Railway Goods promulgated by the Ministry of Railways, it seems unnecessary and illegal to advertise for merchants to bid and contract, and it is easy to cause disputes. The station's hundreds of workers have recently been approved for registration by the central government and have joined the union. The union will naturally protect any events that harm the workers' interests and livelihood. The Railway Bureau's statement that the workers' petition was to resist on behalf of the former contractors Meng Jinsun and Tao Ziming is a misunderstanding. Before the Railway Bureau issued the bidding advertisement, the workers at the station had already prepared to petition the party and government organs to relieve the pain of contractor exploitation. It is impossible for them to resist on behalf of Meng et al. when the Railway Bureau canceled Meng's contract. The case has been submitted to the Party Headquarters for relief and to the Railway Bureau for attention, and a satisfactory solution is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Workers at Shangbei Freight Yard Request Withdrawal of Manager Shu</h3>
<p>There are more than 120 loading and unloading workers at the Shanghai North Station freight yard. Gao Ge is the chief foreman, organizing a cooperative to contract the loading and unloading work at the Shangbei freight yard with the Railway Bureau. They are also allowed to hire temporary workers to help when the work is busy. In August of this year, the Railway Bureau sent Sun Zhusan to be the contractor of the Shangbei freight yard, which caused a fight between the new and old workers. Later, the Party Headquarters and the Union came forward to mediate, and the Railway Bureau withdrew Sun Zhusan. At the same time, the Shangbei Loading and Unloading Cooperative was changed to the Shangbei Loading and Unloading Office, and Shu Enze was appointed as the organizer. All the new and old workers were re-registered, expanding the quota to 180 people. For several months, they were at peace. Recently, because Organizer Shu abused his power and deprived the workers of their benefits, the workers as a whole disagreed and petitioned the Special Party Headquarters to forward a letter to the Railway Bureau requesting his withdrawal to avoid further disputes (the original petition is omitted).</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Build Their Own Offices on Baoshan Road</h3>
<p>Pile Driving Project Largely Completed, Entire Project to be Completed by Next Autumn</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus are building their own offices on Baoshan Road to reduce the heavy expense of renting houses. The funds for the construction are borrowed from the bureau's employees' pension fund. The building was designed by architect Dong Dayou, and everything inside is quite complete. The pile driving project, which was contracted by Xu Shunxing Construction Factory on November 17, has been completed with 322 piles driven. Construction of the building will begin immediately, and the entire project is expected to be completed by next autumn. The bureau is now inviting bids for the sanitation and heating project, with the deadline for registration on the 20th of this month. The bids will be opened publicly on the afternoon of January 10 next year.</p>
<h3>After the Withdrawal of the Chuan Exchange Certificate, the Shanghai-Sichuan Exchange Rate is Balanced</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Chongqing Exchange Rate Drops to 1008 Yuan</p>
<p>Liu Hangshen, the head of the Sichuan Finance Department, borrowed 8 million yuan from the Central Bank, as well as the previous 4 million yuan, totaling 12 million yuan, and temporarily suspended repayment. After success, the funds were given to the Sichuan financial community to regulate the market. The non-convertible exchange certificates issued by the Chongqing banks and firms (issued as a substitute due to a lack of currency, not convertible) were all recovered in full on the 15th of this month and are no longer circulating in the market. From now on, the currency circulating in the market will be the legal currency of the Central Bank. As a result, the Shanghai-Sichuan exchange rate is gradually returning to normal. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Juxing Bank that the Shanghai-Sichuan exchange rate is:</p>
<p>Chongqing: 1008 yuan</p>
<p>Wanxian: 1007 yuan</p>
<p>Chengdu: 1012 yuan</p>
<p>Whether remitting from Shanghai to Sichuan or from Sichuan to Shanghai, the difference is minimal and is now no different from other exchange rates, which is a huge difference compared to the previous Sichuan silver of over 1500 yuan and Shanghai silver of 1000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Civilian Housing on Qimei Road and Other Locations Fully Equipped Internally</h3>
<p>Plans to Continue Construction in Pudong and Other Locations</p>
<p>The civilian housing in the city, at four locations including Qimei Road, Zhongshan Road, Damuqiao, and Pushan Road, has been under active construction since it started on July 1st of this year, so the project is progressing very quickly. Each village has already started registering tenants on the 16th of this month, so all the civilian villages have been completed. In addition to the housing project, which was completed long ago, the remaining internal installations, such as the installation of electric lights and sanitary equipment, have also been completed. The equipment is perfect, and the rental price is also relatively low because it is for the benefit of the common people. Zhongshan Road requires well digging, so it will take more than a month to complete, but it has nothing to do with the tenants moving in, because the other projects have been completed. In addition to the completion of these four civilian new villages, the municipal government also plans to continue building civilian new villages in Youdong and other places. The construction site has already been determined, but the construction will start on a selected date after the municipal government approves the funding and the funds are raised.</p>

<h3>Bihan Institute Contacting Hospitals to Treat and Detoxify Those Accepted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Bihan Institute of the Charitable Organizations United Association sent letters yesterday to Shanghai Hospital, Xinpu Yutang, and Temporary Detoxification Institute, asking them to treat and detoxify the poor. Our Institute was established on the 15th of this month, and the first institute on the Che Zhan Road Chaozhou Guild Hall has accepted more than 1,300 civilians. It is also planned to establish a second institute at the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. Every winter, after our institute opens, your hall, institute, and institute have sent people to provide free medical treatment and quit smoking for civilians, and the results have been remarkable, which shows enthusiasm and kindness. The number of people accepted this year will probably be even greater than in previous years. Those who come to the institute every day are still coming one after another. Therefore, this letter is sent to sincerely request that you still follow the past practice of sending staff to the institute on a rotating basis every day, divided into free medical treatment and smoking cessation, and allocate more smoking cessation drugs to treat the poor and get rid of their suffering, which is immeasurable merit. It is also heard that the chairman of the institute, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, etc., in order to promote Buddhism and persuade civilians, have ordered Zhang Zixin to supervise the administrators to give lectures and recite Buddhist scriptures in shifts at a set time every day to persuade them. The weather is still warm now, and the poor are coming in droves. After the wind and snow, even more people who are hungry and cold will come to the institute. We hope that all great benefactors will generously donate clothes and rice, please send them to the Charity Organization United Association of Renji Hall on Liu Ma Road, to benefit the poor, which is immeasurable merit.</p>

<h3>Foreign Monk Zhao Kong Accuses Russian Newspaper, Verdict Announced</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Publisher Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>The foreign monk Zhao Kong, a Hungarian whose original name was Deroubiexu Linken (transliteration), previously filed a lawsuit through his legal representatives, Russian lawyers Shu Shengmin and others, with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. The lawsuit concerned a news article published in the German newspaper "Chaila Wanbao" at 774 Xiafei Road on August 3rd of this year. The article allegedly stated that Deroubiexu Linken was serving as a military intelligence officer for Abyssinia, inciting the Italo-Abyssinian War and supplying Abyssinia with disguised shipments of military supplies. He claimed this was a deliberate defamation and infringement of his reputation. The suit named Lin Bichi (transliteration), the publisher of the Russian newspaper "Chaila Wanbao," and Weiss (transliteration), a female editor, as defendants in a private prosecution for defamation. The suit also included a civil claim seeking joint and several damages of 10,000 yuan. The court accepted the case and, after several hearings presided over by Judge Sun of Sun Peng Street, the defendants, represented by lawyer Jiang Guofang, argued that the news was reprinted from a French-language newspaper published in Latvia (transliterated place name). They also presented counter-evidence and newspaper articles regarding the plaintiff's past in Europe. The closing arguments had already been delivered, and the date for the verdict had been set, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the day of the verdict. Around 9:00 AM, Judge Sun arrived at the Second Criminal Court to deliver the judgment. Both parties were present with their lawyers. The court read out the judgment, which found Lin Bichi and Weiss not guilty. The plaintiff's accompanying civil claim was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Silk Brocade and Electrical Equipment Associations Ordered to Destroy Old System Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>This city's silk brocade industry association and the electrical equipment and silk weaving factory industry association, following the instruction of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to swiftly gather all old system weights and measures instruments from their respective trades for destruction by the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office, have already been chronicled in this newspaper. It is now known that these two associations, in conjunction with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each sent staff, armed with the bureau’s orders, to collect the items house by house. This has been going on for three days. Yesterday was the third day. It is reported that while many complied with the order by directly sending the items to the two associations for forwarding and destruction, many others were still hesitant. In order to strictly enforce the policy and prevent any negligence, the two associations dispatched their personnel to retrieve old rulers from various lanes including Tao Zhu Lane on Jiujiang Road, Ri Xin Lane on Nanjing Road, as well as Nanbei Xiangfen Lane, and the western section of Fujian Road on Ningbo Road. However, some firms still refused to comply, including Jin Yu, Jiu Da Yu (Danyang Gang), Yi Kang, Zhi Lun, De Yuan, and Hui Kang in Tao Zhu Lane, Yu Feng Xiang Yong Ji in Ri Xin Lane, and Shen Mao Ji in Jifu Lane. It is said that some Danyang Gang firms and Shen Mao Ji are blatantly disregarding government regulations and refusing to hand over the items. The two associations are reportedly preparing to jointly report this to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that they be summoned and penalized.</p>

<h3>Li Jingfang's Concubine Sues for Inheritance, Embezzlement Case to be Judged Today</h3>
<p>Li Jingfang, the son of the late Qing dynasty Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang, who died in Dalian, left a handwritten letter during his lifetime, disposing of his family property and providing his concubine, Li Wu, with 23,000 yuan for her retirement and funeral expenses. After Li's death, Ms. Li Wu claimed that she had not received this money and alleged that Li's son, Guo Tao, his grandsons, Jia Ji and Jia Xing, and Zhou Mengwen, the current general manager of the Wuhu Liji Shipping Company and a witness in the letter, had jointly embezzled the funds. Therefore, she hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-prosecution with the First Special District District Court against Li Guotao and others for embezzlement and breach of trust, requesting legal action and demanding that the defendants pay 23,000 yuan in compensation. Details of multiple summonses have been reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held a continuation of the trial. Li Jiaxing, who had previously claimed illness and failed to appear, also complied with the summons and testified that Boxin was his grandfather, and he was not present in Dalian when the letter was written last winter. All the property allocated to him was received by his father, Guo Tao, on his behalf at that time. Subsequently, Li Guohua, Li Jingfang's daughter, testified that she was also in Dalian at the time, and she had received the property she was entitled to. Li Wu was also present at the time, but she did not witness Li Wu receiving the 23,000 yuan, and she did not know whether the money was being kept by her brother, Guo Tao, and others. At that time, Li Wu immediately stated that she had not received a single penny. Defendant Zhou Mengwen responded to the letters presented by the plaintiff, Li Guojin, stating that his letter to Guotao on February 2nd to 6th was in response to Guojin's letter to him on February 20th, proposing to raise another 3,000 yuan for Li Wu as a settlement. The court then considered that the facts of the case had been clarified through investigation and ordered the lawyers of both the plaintiff and the defendant to begin their arguments, then adjourned the hearing to issue a verdict on the afternoon of the 19th of this month (today).</p>

<h3>Public Prosecution Initiated in Xinxing Bloodshed Case</h3>
<p>Dong Wenkui, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, residing at No. 12 Wei Ning Road in the Nanshi district, was a yellow sand and gravel broker. On September 20th of this year, at 1:00 PM, Dong went to the Xinxing Bathhouse near the Lishes Bridge at the train station to take a bath. As soon as he entered the upstairs area of the bathhouse, he was suddenly attacked by six or seven thugs wielding knives, causing injuries to his head, both arms, and abdomen, even causing his intestines to spill out. Dong held them in place with his hands until he was taken to the hospital, where doctors managed to put his intestines back in. The assailants had already fled without a trace. Dong's family reported the case to the police to apprehend the perpetrators. The Public Security Bureau has now arrested Tian Asan, Ding Aquan, and two other suspects in the case and transferred them to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and prosecution on charges of attempted murder. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Chen Jingyi opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Dong Wenkui, testified, "I have no prior grudges against Tian Asan and Ding Aquan. I do not know who instructed them to harm me with knives. I ask for justice." Tian Asan, 24 years old, from Shaoxing, who is currently in custody, stated, "I am a friend of Dong Wenkui. We have always been close." He otherwise provided evasive testimony. Ding Aquan, 21 years old, from Shaoxing, denied committing the crime. Witness Li Chunfu, 43 years old, from Danyang, who works as a tea server at the Xinxing Bathhouse, testified, "After lunch on September 20th, he (referring to Tian Asan) rushed behind Dong with a cleaver, appearing as if he was about to commit violence. I was shocked and ran upstairs to inform the manager, who called the police. They all escaped through the back door." The judge, finding it necessary to investigate the case further, ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody pending a future hearing.</p>

<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Second Installment of "Red Lotus Temple" at the Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Since staging "Burning of Red Lotus Temple," the Grand Theater on Aiduya Road has experienced unprecedented success. Because of this new type of small play with elaborate sets, Mr. Zhang Shankun, the manager of the theater, deeply understanding this point, has recruited specialized talent and meticulously studied the craft. Not only is the imitation lifelike, but also attention has been paid to the mechanics and lighting. As a result, the theater is widely recognized as a comprehensive exhibition of mechanical and lifelike scenery. For the newly compiled second installment of "Red Lotus Temple," more than 5,000 yuan has been spent to specially create various sets, totaling more than 40 scenes. One scene even features a grandly lit crystal palace scene. The setup for this scene takes one hour, so the screenwriter has specially placed it in the first scene.

By 8:00 PM, more than 300 people had left due to the lack of seats. In a sluggish market, such a grand occasion is truly innovative.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>The Cement Industry in Shanghai (Continued)</p>
<p>(4) Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing process varies depending on the nature of the raw materials. Companies like China and Shanghai generally use the semi-wet process. In this process, after the raw materials are transported to the factory, limestone is poured into a stone crushing machine to be crushed. Clay is then poured into a washing mill to be ground into slurry. The slurry is then transported into mixing vats. The crushed limestone is fed into a tube mill to be ground into a fine powder, which is then fed into limestone vats and mixed with the slurry in the mixing machine at a specific ratio. If the desired ratio is not achieved, more limestone or slurry is added to achieve the desired ratio. After thorough mixing, the mixture is transported to slurry ponds and then fed into rotary kilns for firing. Before the slurry enters the kiln, it must be heated to a high temperature using pulverized coal. The coal is burned inside the kiln and therefore must be ground into a fine powder. First, crushed coal is transported to a drying room to be dried. After drying, it is ground into a fine powder using a tube mill and blown into the kiln using a strong draft. During combustion, the slurry is continuously fed into the kiln from the rear end, while pulverized coal is blown in from the front end. As the slurry moves from the rear end to the front end, its temperature gradually increases. When the temperature at the front end is high enough and the slurry is fully calcined, it falls out of small holes at the front end and is then loaded into a ball mill to be ground fine. At the same time, finely ground gypsum powder is sent to a wooden vat and swept into the ball mill to be mixed with the clinker. After grinding evenly, it becomes cement. However, the cement must be screened again, and the coarse particles are ground finer and stored in underground kilns before being sent to the packaging station and loaded into barrels. According to an investigation, Qixin Company's product can hold 187.5 pounds of cement per bag, and each barrel can hold one bag, totaling 375 pounds. Shanghai and China companies use barrels exclusively, with each barrel holding 281.5 pounds.</p>
<p>(5) Supply and Demand Situation: According to an investigation, China's annual cement sales are approximately 5 million barrels, while the annual production capacity of domestic factories is approximately 3 million barrels. The shortfall is supplied by Hong Kong, Anfu, Germany, the Dalian Onoda Cement Company, and the Asano Cement Company. In view of this situation, the government recently joined forces with several industrialists to organize a large-scale cement company in Beijing. It is expected that China will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in cement in the future.</p>
<p>(6) Current Status of Shanghai's Chinese-Owned Factories: In this port, only the Shanghai Chinese Cement Company, the Longtan Chinese Cement Company, and the Qixin Cement Company are engaged in the cement business (although the Qixin Cement Company's manufacturing plant is located in Tangshan, its annual business volume in Shanghai far exceeds that of the other two companies, so based on the data obtained, a brief description is included). The factories are all funded and established by Chinese merchants and use machinery for manufacturing. China and Shanghai companies each employ 200 to 400 workers, while Qixin employs over 1,000 workers. The equipment in the factories is generally divided into five major departments: raw material grinding department, kiln department, clinker grinding department, fuel grinding department, and power department. However, the China Cement Company uses stone materials obtained from nearby quarries, so it has a dedicated quarrying department. A summary of each company is listed in the table below:</p>

<h3>Expenditure on Compulsory Education in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>The total budgeted expenditure for compulsory education in Chahar Province was originally 150,360 yuan. After deducting the central government subsidy of 47,000 yuan, the remaining amount was to be raised by the province and local areas. Due to financial difficulties, the budget for each class in short-term primary schools had to be reduced by 60 yuan. With a planned addition of 511 classes, the total reduction amounted to 30,660 yuan. Thus, the actual expenditure for compulsory education in the 24th year of the Republic in the province was 119,700 yuan.</p>
<p>The methods for raising funds, jointly reviewed by the Education and Finance Departments, stipulated that besides the central government subsidy of 47,000 yuan, the remaining 72,700 yuan would be raised by allocating 1% of the province's total revenue of over 3,190,000 yuan in the 24th year of the Republic for compulsory education. It was estimated that the provincial treasury would allocate 31,800 yuan annually. Additionally, each county and bureau would contribute based on their financial situation, the number of schools they operated, and other special circumstances, totaling 40,900 yuan.</p>
<p>The decision on the amount of compulsory education funds to be raised by the province and counties in the 24th year of the Republic is as follows:</p>
<p>*   Provincial Finance Department: 31,800 yuan.</p>
<p>*   Counties: Except for Guyuan County, where local finances were difficult and exemption was requested, the other 14 counties, including Wanquan, would contribute a total of 38,040 yuan (the largest contributor being 6,000 yuan, followed by 4,800 yuan, 4,200 yuan, 3,400 yuan, 3,000 yuan, 1,680 yuan, 1,200 yuan, 960 yuan, and the smallest being 600 yuan).</p>
<p>*   Chongli, Shangyi, Huade and other established administrative bureaus: a total of 2,880 yuan.</p>
<p>The total is 72,720 yuan.</p>

The results were: (A) Designating special locations in consideration of the conditions of each school for use as self-study rooms; (B) Adopting the principle of dividing into groups and rooms with teacher guidance; (C) Fully utilizing classrooms with special equipment as self-study rooms for reference purposes.</p>
<p>*   The proposal that affiliated middle schools of universities with educational colleges or normal colleges must still establish normal departments. The result: transferred to the Teacher Training Group for research.</p>
<p>*   The proposal to request the Education Bureau to instruct the zoo and botanical garden to prepare a full set of biological specimens and models according to the equipment standards promulgated by the ministry for loan to all middle schools in the city for use. The result: passed as originally planned.</p>
<p>*   The proposal that various classrooms should have special settings to improve the efficiency of teaching in each subject. The result: In addition to special subjects such as manual work, music, drawing, and vocational subjects, which should have special classrooms, other subjects should, as far as possible, be equipped with appropriate specimens, charts, photographs, and ordinary reference materials according to the nature of the subject. Students should be encouraged to create or collect materials and use them to enrich the classrooms.</p>
<p>*   The proposal for each school to formulate a plan for increasing teaching equipment annually.</p>
<p>*   The proposal to request the government to subsidize the teaching equipment expenses of each school in stages. The result: The above two proposals were discussed together.

<p>*   The proposal to request the Municipal Education Bureau to establish science experiment halls in each district. The result: submitted to the general assembly according to the original proposal.</p>
<h3>Chinese Education Association Sponsors Middle School Students' Mandarin Speech Competition</h3>
<p>The men's group competition rescheduled to January 12th. The municipal secondary school teachers and staff association-sponsored citywide middle school student speech competition, the women's group competition, has already been held on the 15th of this month; details of which were reported in the previous issue. It is now known that the men's group competition was originally scheduled for the 29th of this month, but due to a time conflict with the science lecture competition organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, the association has notified the schools that it has been rescheduled to January 12th (Sunday) at 1:00 PM, still to be held at the Youth Middle School. It is also heard that various middle schools are now actively registering at the association's office on Daji Road (the old site of the Municipal Education Bureau).</p>
<h3>Yunnan Education Director Gong Zizhi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Purchasing Supplies for Popularizing National Education; Will Soon Go to Beijing to Request Instructions on Educational Policy</p>
<p>Gong Zizhi, the director of the Education Department of the Yunnan Provincial Government, recently came to Shanghai personally to purchase a large number of teaching materials, instrument models, books, etc., needed for the province's implementation of a five-year program to popularize basic national education. He arrived in Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan Wheel yesterday morning and stayed at the residence of a relative or friend. In the afternoon, he went to the Commercial Press on Henan Road to visit its latest published textbooks and children's toy series, etc. According to what he told reporters, his purpose here, in addition to ordering various educational supplies and radios, is to travel to Beijing in three to five days to visit Education Minister Wang to request instructions on the province's future educational policy and to negotiate funding for popular education.</p>
<h3>Citizen Education Center Holds Scout Exhibition</h3>
<p>Divided into Indoor Exhibition and Camp Sections; Simple and Clear Display for Easy Understanding of Systematic Knowledge</p>
<p>This month's activities at the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Education Center focus on promoting the labor service movement. The exhibition group has prepared a scout exhibition to arouse the interest of the general public in organized labor service. The exhibition is co-organized by the Shanghai Scout Council and assisted by related businesses, making the content quite substantial. The indoor exhibition section will open on December 18 and close on January 5 next year. The camp section, guided and arranged by Zhao Weizu of the Scout Council, will open on December 25. Scout organizations have a long history in our country, but they are only part of the schools or institutions themselves and have not been publicly displayed to society. Therefore, this exhibition at the center is a pioneering effort. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited the indoor exhibition section yesterday and found that there were more than 100 exhibits, arranged in an orderly manner, making it easy for visitors to gain systematic knowledge after browsing.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Improving Chinese Musical Instruments (3)</h3>
<p>— Ding Xielin</p>
<p>Before this problem has received a purely scientific answer, physicists have already told us that sound is the vibration of air, and the pitch of a tone is entirely determined by the speed of vibration. To put it simply, pitch is the frequency of vibration, and the harmony of a tone depends on whether the frequencies of vibration form a simple ratio. It has no direct relationship with the length of a pipe or string. Moreover, from a physics perspective, we know that the length of a pipe or string forming a simple ratio, strictly speaking, cannot produce vibrations with frequencies forming a simple ratio. As a result, although the lengths of the pipes or strings form a simple ratio, the pitches are not absolutely harmonious. Conversely, although the lengths of the pipes or strings do not form a simple ratio, if the frequencies of vibration form a simple ratio, absolutely harmonious pitches can be produced. Therefore, we can conclude that in the study of pitch, unless the concept of vibration frequency is clearly understood and musical instruments are made according to scientific methods, it is futile to still rely on the philosophy of "Hetu," "Luoshu," "Yin and Yang," and "Climate," or use the arithmetic of squares containing circles, or circles containing squares, in the hope of obtaining harmonious "pitch pipes." This is the second stage of the evolution of our knowledge of pitch.</p>
<p>Why are vibrations with frequencies forming a simple ratio harmonious, while vibrations with frequencies not forming a simple ratio are not harmonious? Is it that our ears not only understand simple arithmetic but also like simple arithmetic? The scientific answer to this question is the contribution of the great physicist Helmholtz. Simply put, the feeling of harmony is not that our ears find a certain sound pleasing, but that they find a certain sound grating. This grating sound is the "beat" produced by two sounds with frequencies close to each other in acoustics. The reason why the sounds with frequencies forming a simple ratio are pleasing is that they do not produce grating "beats." This is the third stage of the evolution of our knowledge of pitch. This problem is further from the topic of this article, so we can stop talking about it.</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese pitch, we must also specifically mention that the equal temperament twelve-tone scale invented by Zhu Zaiyu in the Ming Dynasty, which is commonly used in modern Western music, is indeed the same as what Zhu advocated. However, the reason why modern Western music adopts the equal temperament twelve-tone scale is not because this pitch is an ideal scale, but because it is a compromise method to solve the difficulties encountered in the construction of musical instruments during "modulation." The structure of the equal temperament twelve-tone scale does not conform to strict pitch theory. This point is known to Western musicians but not known to Zhu Zaiyu. Zhu lived in an era 300 years ago when science was not developed. We are certainly not blaming Zhu for saying this, but those who extremely admire Zhu should understand this point.</p>
<p>The above is all about the "pitch" aspect. The inherent Chinese musical culture related to musical instruments includes not only pitch but also the musical instruments themselves. Before the development of science, Western musical instrument manufacturing had already achieved amazing results. Even now, many problems still rely entirely on experience and experimentation. Although a perfect musical instrument obtained from experience can be scientifically explained through scientific research, science cannot completely instruct the manufacturing method of any musical instrument or any part of a musical instrument. The sound we hear from a musical instrument is emitted through the transmission of various parts of the instrument. These transmitting parts, on the good side, can improve the timbre of the original sound based on the effect of resonance; on the bad side, they can add the inharmonious sounds generated by themselves. The importance of the wood and hollow structure of violins and guqins and the difference in the timbres of bamboo flutes and copper flutes are almost universally experienced. Moreover, some musical instruments have a relationship with "age" and "skill." The older the age and the deeper the skill, the better the quality. Therefore, it is valuable and worth studying if China has excellent musical instruments passed down from ancient times. And there may also be many materials in books about musical instruments that can be used as a reference for improving existing Chinese musical instruments.</p>
<p>Finally, we can simply list the obvious points that Chinese existing musical instruments should be improved as follows:</p>
<p>The pitch of all musical instruments should uniformly adopt the pitch commonly used in Western music. All musical instruments with fixed pitches, such as the sheng, flute, pipa, moon guitar, gong, drum, etc., should be improved or reconstructed so that each has a specified accurate pitch, so that they can be played together.</p>
<p>The structure of the scale should adopt the equal temperament twelve-tone scale. All multi-tone instruments should increase the number of "semitones" as much as possible. Stringed instruments that use "frets" should increase the number of "frets." Xiao and flutes should increase the number of tone holes. The sheng should increase the number of tone pipes so that modern musical works can be played. Even for playing extremely simple musical pieces, the xiao and flute can at least increase one hole so that they can play the two commonly played tunes of "Zheng Gong" and "Xiao Gong" separately.</p>
<p>The range should be increased as much as possible. The range of Chinese musical instruments is too narrow. The musical instruments in the high-pitched part and the low-pitched part, especially the low-pitched part, should be supplemented. Sheng, xiao, and flutes can be divided into several types of high-pitched and low-pitched. It seems that the range of each type is not difficult to increase to nearly three "equal temperaments." At least two and a half equal temperaments are definitely no problem. The yangqin seems to be able to increase from two and a half equal temperaments to four equal temperaments. The inner diameter of the Chinese xiao and flute has always been the same size throughout. In order to harmonize the volume of the high-pitched and low-pitched sounds, the structure should be changed to two sections with different inner diameters, similar to the structure of a Western flute. According to the current structure of the Chinese xiao, the double pitch emitted by heavy blowing is too high. It seems that this problem can be solved by changing the structure of the blowing end.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points for improvement and possible improvement of several musical instruments are only examples and explanations based on the work of the Instrument Workshop of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica in the past year. Of course, there are many other musical instruments that should be improved. Even taking the above points as an example, because the work is only at the beginning and the experience gained is limited, there are unavoidable omissions, and I hope to get the corrections from experts.

<h3>Little Men (1) (2) (8)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"My darling, why are you crying?" his mother asked, still fussing over him.</p>
<p>"I'm crying because I was lost," wailed Rob, trying to squeeze out a tear or two, but failing utterly.</p>
<p>"But you're back now. Nan says he didn't cry when he was lost, and we praise you for being a brave little man."</p>
<p>"I was too frightened to cry then. But now I want to cry, 'cause I didn't want to be lost," explained Rob, though he seemed already succumbing to the blandishments of sleep, and struggling desperately with a mouthful of bread and milk.</p>
<p>The boys could not help laughing at this mode of consolation, and Rob stopped to stare at them; but everyone looked so good-humored, that, after a wondering glance, he broke into a joyful "Ha, ha!" tossing his spoon upon the table as if he, too, found the joke an excellent one. Here Mr. Bhaer glanced at his watch, and said, "It is ten o'clock; to bed, every one of you."</p>
<p>"Thank the Lord, there's not an empty bed to-night," added Mrs. Bhaer, with tears in her eyes as she watched Rob cuddled up in his father's arms, and Nan trotting off with Meg and Josie, feeling that she was the most interesting and important member of the party.</p>

<h3>Strong Basketball Team Lianghua Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Schedule in Shanghai is Set</p>
<p>The Lianghua basketball team, reunited with the five tigers of North China, has come to Shanghai with the ambition to avenge the old score against the Maclears. It has been arranged by the Progressive Association to have friendly matches with the four strong teams of this city. It is known that the team of fourteen people arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, unloaded their equipment at Delin Apartment, and the schedule has been arranged as follows, with the venue at Shenyuan:</p>
<p>21st Maclears 8:15 PM</p>
<p>23rd Jinan Team 8:15 PM</p>
<p>25th Xie Dian Team 8:15 PM</p>
<p>27th Pirates Under Negotiation</p>
<h3>Maclears Defeats John</h3>
<p>Nanxing Defeats Qingguang</p>
<p>There were three basketball games last night in Xiqing. The game between John and Maclears was particularly intense. John had been in the lead all the way, but in the end, Xu Wenkui was fouled off the court, resulting in a depleted lineup and a sharp decline, which was a pity. The game between Qingguang and Nanxing was also very close. In the end, Qingguang was defeated by only three points. The full results are as follows:</p>
<p>Shell Denton Middle (B) 26 vs 24</p>
<p>Maclears Wins John (A) 61 vs 43</p>
<p>Nanxing Wins Qingguang (A) 42 vs 39</p>
<p>The game between Maclears and John was full of highlights. John relied on Xu Wenkui's accurate shooting and was in a very advantageous position, plus the strict defense of the guards, Maclears could not succeed. When the score reached 32 to 22, John had an absolute advantage. Xu Wenkui was fouled out of the court because of four fouls, and the momentum was slightly reduced. But at the end of the first half, John still led with 34 to 28. In the second half, John's forward lost a main player, and the situation became unsustainable. Maclears took the opportunity to rise and went straight to the end, eventually reversing the defeat with 61 to 43.</p>
<p>In the first half of the game between Qingguang and Nanxing, Qingguang led throughout. Tan Dahua and Dong Xiaopei were still heroic and scored frequently. Nanxing was disorganized and chaotic, and there was nothing to commend. In the second half, Qingguang's personnel changes backfired, and Nanxing worked hard to catch up and overtake. In the end, Qingguang tried to catch up, but due to time constraints, they lost by three points, which was a great pity.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Football Match - Guanghua vs Fudan on Saturday</h3>
<p>2:30 PM at Fudan Stadium</p>
<p>In this year's football championship hosted by the Jiangnan University Sports Association, the Jinan team, which dominates Jiangnan University football, drew with Guanghua in the first match and defeated Fudan in the second match. In this year's championship, it is generally expected that the team still has high hopes. Both Guanghua and Fudan are also very strong. The two teams will meet at Fudan Stadium at 2:30 PM this Saturday (21st). The outcome is uncertain.</p>

The following is a summary of the accounts with the largest actual purchases (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Yarn Sellers</p>
<p>Yarn Buyers</p>
<h3>Recent Import Volume of Foreign Cotton into This City</h3>
<p>Recent imports of foreign cotton into this port include 6,220 bales of American cotton, 2,600 bales of Indian cotton, and 900 bales of Egyptian cotton. There were no imports of South American cotton or Burmese cotton.</p>
<h3>Recent Purchases of American Cotton by Traders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened strong due to positive news from Liverpool, with foreign merchants buying in. The actual situation was relatively firm, with few sellers. Market activity was lively, with prices for all months rising by 11 to 16 points. However, buying interest was weak, and the market softened again as long positions were closed out, cotton farmers sold hedges, and local assistants sold off. There was a lack of new players from outside the industry, and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. At the close, traders bought near-month contracts, which remained firm. Spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 17 points. Spot prices for English cotton fell by one point, while futures prices rose by four to five points. Indian cotton saw reactive buying, and the market was firm due to positive news from Liverpool, although there were few buyers. Price increases were: Ping Guo Er up 0.25 rupees, Aomula up 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi up 0.79 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated the 17th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi cotton on the 18th was 217 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 17th stated that the Pi Nai Yue Company's estimate of ginned cotton production for the current season is 9,826,000 bales, compared to 9,388,000 bales in the previous season.</p>
<h3>Food Grains: Bullish Sentiment for Bidding on Flour Lacking</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed initial stability across all months, followed by weakness and then sideways movement. Opening prices in the morning were influenced by quotations for foreign wheat, with Chicago prices up about three corners for near months and four parts for distant months, and Canadian prices up one corner. Market buying interest was initially quite active, but then weakened as actual sales showed no improvement and outside long positions eased off. Profit-takers also sold, causing the market to weaken again, falling by 1 to 2 cents compared to the opening. At the afternoon opening, trading became quiet with few participants. The current month saw a slight rebound of one cent due to minor stocking by factories, while distant months remained sideways with minimal fluctuations. As the end of the lunar year and account settlements approached, both long and short positions were expected to become more cautious, reducing significant competition.</p>
<h3>Wheat Transactions This Month Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally calm in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The current month, being close to delivery, saw active trading as sellers prepared to deliver and outside long positions mostly closed out, while short positions also took advantage of the opportunity to cover. Trading in distant months was sluggish due to the weak flour market, with outside participants holding back. The market lacked vitality. Future developments would continue to depend on the rise and fall of overseas wheat markets. The spot wheat market saw no high-quality wheat changing hands, and prices for mid-range wheat edged down slightly. Opening prices were: Bengbu wheat at $4.78, Shaoxing wheat at $4.61, and Hankou wheat at $ per 1,000 bales, taken by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrivals and Slow Sales of River Rice Lead to Price Declines</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a surge of arrivals from various gangs totaled 60 to 70 boats (carrying 13,000 to 14,000 piculs), further weakening the market. The price of thick early japonica rice fell by 1 to 1.5 corners. Although about 4,000 to 5,000 bales of high-quality thin indica rice were sold, mostly by upper-level firms, the market appeared relatively stable. Mid-level firms struggled to stay afloat, with prices weakening by 5 cents. High-quality Du Jian rice was firm, while mid-quality rice was weak. Yang Jian rice was in short supply and remained firm. Yin Wan rice still showed some quality.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals of boats from various rivers downstream were quite strong, and river stocks were also high, with some reaching 250 to 260 boats. Sales of white japonica rice in the market remained slow, and shop interest was still sluggish. Warehouse owners slightly adjusted prices downward due to slow turnover, further weakening by 1 corner or more. Arrivals of early indica rice were small, and sales were acceptable, maintaining a stable market. Sales of thin indica rice continued, maintaining a firm market. Although arrivals of Yang Jian rice were not strong, sales were average, and prices edged up by almost 1 corner. White Yuan rice sales were sluggish among wine merchants and remained slow, weakening by several cents. Ke Jian rice also weakened by several cents. Prices of other types of rice softened further.</p>
<h3>The Market for Customer Indica Rice is Generally Weak with Short Grain Varieties in Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica rice market shifted to a stable phase. New arrivals of Jiangxi rice were not strong, while Hunan, Shashi, and Hankou saw new arrivals, but in small quantities. Although arrivals of Wenzhou rice were large, the market demand was also strong, suggesting temporary stability. However, industry insiders believed that the production of rice along the Yangtze River was abundant this year, and Zhejiang also reported a good harvest, requiring customer sales to improve the market. Currently, the market remains generally weak with short grain varieties in demand. Yesterday, sales included 1,500 bales of Wenzhou rice, 50 bales of Taiwanese rice, 200 bales of Ningbo rice, 657 bales of rice from Hankou, Hunan, and Shashi, and 100 bales of Gan rice, all purchased by local firms.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Transactions Sluggish, Sales Prices Declining</h3>
<p>Recently, actual sales of raw silk overseas have been sluggish, leading to few transactions in Shanghai and gradually declining market prices. Yesterday, only Feng Da Chang and other foreign firms showed interest in purchasing coarse-filament white filature silk of 78 degrees evenness, at a price of $730, down $15 from last week. There is no possibility of improvement in the depressed market sentiment before the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Export Statistics for Raw Silk from This City for the First Half of December</h3>
<p>From December 1st to December 15th, 1935, exports of raw silk totaled 3,751 bales, plus 1,270 bales of waste silk, for a total of 5,021 bales.</p>

<h3>A Word of Contribution: Talking About Gift-Giving</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Humans are emotional beings, and because of these emotions, there are reciprocal gestures of courtesy. These gifts represent the affection between friends and relatives. The ancients had a good explanation when they said, "Courtesy demands reciprocity; to give without receiving is impolite; to receive without giving is also impolite." We don't celebrate Christmas like foreigners, but the New Year is fast approaching. According to custom, we can't avoid exchanging gifts with friends and relatives. However, everyone fears giving gifts, even more so than fearing receiving them. Why is this? It's because they fear giving the wrong kind of gift, or an unnecessary one. Giving foreign goods is inappropriate, and giving useless gifts, or gifts that many people dislike, is unnecessary. Therefore, the issue of gift-giving requires careful consideration, and one must consider each person's status and preferences. One shouldn't give gifts haphazardly, as it benefits neither the giver nor the receiver. I believe that gift-giving isn't about the cost, but about whether it's suitable or not. It's not about quantity, but about whether it's needed or not. The ancients said, "Give a precious sword to a hero, give rouge to a beauty." If you were to give a sword to a beauty or rouge to a hero, wouldn't it be a laughing stock? Therefore, the first rule of gift-giving is to be suitable and needed. Gifts should match each person's preferences and shouldn't be about boasting or outdoing others. In the past, there was an honest official named Mr. Lu Longqi. When his superior had a birthday, many people gave expensive gifts. However, Mr. Lu brought straw sandals made from the homespun cloth newly woven by his wife. This was a sincere gesture, demonstrating thrift on his part and practicality for the recipient. We can learn from this. Therefore, gift-giving doesn't require spending a lot of money or putting on a false show. As long as the gift is suitable and needed, even a humble present will be appreciated. That being said, the first rule of gift-giving is to choose domestic goods, the second is to choose practical and necessary domestic goods, the third is to choose domestic goods that can be cherished for a long time, the fourth is to choose domestic goods that are essential for every household, and the fifth is to choose domestic goods that people can benefit from after receiving them. At the same time, don't forget that in addition to giving physical gifts, there are also domestic product gift certificates, which allow the recipient to purchase freely, without the trouble of being constrained or limited. This method is currently being emulated by many and can be implemented at any time. Because the New Year is approaching, this magazine has published a special gift issue to contribute to the ladies and gentlemen of society, serving as a reference for studying the issue of gift-giving.</p>
<h3>How to Give Gifts</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Time urges us on! In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is upon us! It is a matter of course and not blameworthy that relatives and friends interact with each other and exchange gifts to foster feelings! So how, exactly, to give gifts is a question worth discussing. The ancients said, "Sending a goose feather from a thousand miles away shows that the sentiment is greater than the gift." It is better to "deliver charcoal in the snow" than to "add flowers to the brocade." Save meaningless consumption and increase practical utility! We should buy useful domestic goods as soon as possible!</p>
<p>It is better to give relatives and friends practical gifts than to give them things to eat!</p>
<p>For example: Double Coin brand hot water bottles, deerskin gloves, Triangle brand soap, bamboo-themed towels, Goose brand woolen shirts, Jingdezhen gold-rimmed teacups, hand-brand, Aries brand, Empress brand and other woolen yarns to knit small hats, socks, and gloves to give to relatives and friends' children, or buy more domestic product motto calendars, diaries, stationery...etc., which are more meaningful and practical than sweets and toys!</p>
<p>If you really want to add some edible items, then Jiang legs and Iron Anchor brand wine, etc., should always prioritize domestic goods, and imperceptibly enhance relatives' and friends' impressions of domestic goods. This is just a small suggestion, and I think readers will be happy to hear it!</p>
<h3>Gifts for Children</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>The national crisis is so serious; the floods are so widespread. Although the giant wheel of time has turned to the last season; the last few days, we cannot avoid the custom of giving gifts.</p>
<p>Gifts, of course, must be given to strengthen the feelings of relatives and friends, and also to make the production and sales of goods increase, so that the business of society presents a lively atmosphere. The most painful thing is that the people of our country buy foreign goods as gifts. The trend of the modern era is to promote domestic goods is the most fashionable, and also the duty that human beings should fulfill. If you go to buy foreign goods as New Year gifts this year, I am afraid that not only will you not be welcomed by the recipient, but you will be spurned! Instead of buying foreign goods as gifts, it would be more practical to use this money to help with flood relief.</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of China, and everything about them should be given extra attention! We should pay attention to the gifts we choose for children for the New Year, and never buy foreign goods! Don't let children develop the habit of using foreign goods. The most appropriate gifts are some children's books that are beneficial to the mind and body, to cultivate their knowledge. Moreover, the content of children's books is full of fun, and children will definitely welcome them. If you want to send other items, such as Globe brand malt extract cod liver oil produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy, it is also very good, which can nourish the body and contribute to the country in the future. As for playing, you can choose toys that inspire children's scientific thinking, so that their minds are imprinted with the fun of scientific exploration.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people can all pay attention to educating children, are we still afraid that there will be no strong day in the future? This is the greatest mission that parents should bear!</p>
<h3>Gift-Giving in My Family</h3>
<p>— Pu Manbin</p>
<p>As the mistress of my household, I have some experience with the issue of gift-giving, which I will share with you. More than ten years ago, I lived with my sister-in-law, Cao Boquan's wife. Mrs. Cao was a person who was devoted to domestic goods. Every year at the end of the year, she would take me to the bustling streets to find some famous domestic goods stores to buy gifts. Mrs. Cao's idea was the same as mine, to buy practical domestic goods to give to people. She was especially happy to cut some cloth to give away, so the Sanyou Industrial Society often had our footprints. She bought a lot of non-fading Free Cloth throughout the year. We also used enamelware, health shirts, soap, socks, wool rope, etc. as gifts for the New Year and festivals. If someone bought cigarettes, alcohol, foreign goods, or useless toys as gifts, we would honestly and unceremoniously teach them a few words. Therefore, our neighbors, such as Mrs. Jia, Mrs. Xu, and Mrs. Cai, all followed us in promoting domestic goods. I was most proud when my children wore Free Cloth uniforms to school. Many mothers came to ask me for cloth samples and asked me to buy them for them. Relatives and neighbors called me the Domestic Goods Purchasing Agent, which was really funny. Now that the New Year is approaching, everyone is busy with the issue of gift-giving again. I would like to advise the wise ladies of each family to remember one sentence, which is:</p>
<p>Gift-giving should be simple, practical, and needed.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more sentence, which is "Don't say that the gift is light but the sentiment is heavy, send something that is not empty."</p>
<h3>Discussion of New Year Gifts</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Another year has passed, and it's the New Year again. In this New Year that marks the beginning of the year, according to Chinese custom, relatives and friends are supposed to exchange gifts. Ordinary families usually give things like chickens, ducks, and oranges. Those with larger networks may buy imported gifts to show respect. Originally, giving gifts is meant to maintain relationships between relatives and friends. It is good to give gifts during the New Year to celebrate this new year. However, it is necessary to discuss the choice of New Year's gifts.</p>
<p>Giving things like chickens, ducks, and oranges are consumables and do not seem very suitable, but if you give other things, you don't know what people need. If you give people gifts that they don't need, the gift-giver spends a lot of money, but the recipient doesn't need them. So it is very difficult to choose something that people need. As for buying imported goods, first, it loses the original intention of promoting domestic goods, and second, if the recipient is a person who promotes domestic goods, they will despise you for not loving your country. Moreover, imported goods are not necessarily satisfactory to everyone. So my idea is that we should pay attention to the needs of the recipient when choosing New Year's gifts, and secondly, they should be completely domestic goods. Because the New Year is our New Year, and we naturally want to use our domestic goods to buy New Year's gifts. As for what kind of domestic goods are suitable as gifts, I think that towels from Sanyou Industrial Society, cosmetics from Family Industrial Society, and other daily necessities are essential for ordinary people. If you give this kind of gift, I think the recipient will definitely welcome it. If everyone thinks that these necessities do not seem to meet the conditions for giving gifts, then you can buy gift certificates from major domestic goods stores to replace gifts. The recipient can choose what they need with the gift certificate, which is naturally satisfactory!</p>
<p>Here, I would like to make a suggestion to major domestic goods manufacturers, that is, during this New Year, they can issue a joint gift certificate. With this gift certificate, you can go to any domestic goods store to receive things. Because in this way, the recipient of the gift certificate can choose the items they need from the nearby company or the company they need. If major domestic goods manufacturers can implement this method, then there will be a large number of people who buy gift certificates as New Year gifts. This is indeed a good way to expand business!</p>
<h3>New Year Gifts and Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>A year passes quickly, and the wheel of time is about to turn the great student domestic goods year into a historical relic. The brand new New Year is smiling sweetly at us. Indeed, every time a New Year comes, we always have a sense of vigor, and we are filled with hope for the bright future of this New Year.</p>
<p>The New Year is very ____, but ____, I am nervously thinking, and this is also a fact, that under the general worship of foreign goods by the Chinese people, the arrival of this New Year will give foreign goods a good opportunity for large-scale dumping. Originally, giving gifts for the New Year has become an unbreakable habit for the Chinese people, and in this New Year's gift-giving, they have become foreign goods salesmen, like foreign cigarettes and alcohol! Imported candies, toys, and canned foods! We can clearly remember that on the eve of this New Year, it is the time when they are selling the most. I remember Mr. Little Reporter said that he didn't want to see two old men, one with the word "Sheng" as a sign, with a red face, with a cigarette butt in his mouth and in his hand, who is a long-term invader of the Chinese market, and the other with a white beard, wearing a white-trimmed red robe, and carrying a bag on his back, who comes once every year in late December and absorbs a lot of the Chinese people's blood and sweat, who is a temporary plunderer. These two sentences are really painful and insightful, making us very vigilant, and we should always remember them in our hearts and never forget them.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time of the year-end when the second old man on the street has come on the market, I am holding a very sincere heart, and I would like to put forward two earnest hopes to the public who are rushing to handle New Year gifts, first, that everyone should promote domestic goods gifts, and no longer give foreign goods to others, causing them to be despised, and at the same time insulting them. We are Chinese, and we should use Chinese goods, which is a matter of course. Second, to avoid the trouble of choosing domestic goods and being confused by foreign goods, I hope that everyone can go to domestic goods companies, domestic goods stores, and the factory-owned stores set up by various domestic goods factories to buy, especially the current seasonal goods, such as the Triangle brand products, the Li'e brand kerosene stove, the Goose brand health shirts and pants, the Guan Niu Wei candy, the Meifeng gloves, etc., are all good gifts for the New Year, and are worth introducing.</p>
<p>Everyone is happily waiting for the New Year, but I am deeply afraid here, and I am worried that in the consumption during this New Year, we will send away a lot of good money. On the contrary, we must recognize the current crisis and promote domestic production and protect domestic production. Then, the future New Year will definitely bring us more perfect happiness.</p>
<h3>My New Year Gift-Giving</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the New Year is coming soon. Once the New Year arrives, everyone will inevitably follow the custom of giving gifts. In this kind of recession, the so-called gifts, in the policy of austerity, of course, not giving is economical, but if you don't give gifts to people, people will give gifts, and if you reject them, it will be disrespectful, then under the acceptance, you can't help but return the favor. So if you want to advocate not giving gifts alone, it is difficult to do. As for me, when the end of the year comes, I can't help but send gifts first, but if someone sends them, based on the principle of "courtesy demands reciprocity," I can't help but send gifts back, but my gift-giving has several creeds:</p>
<p>A total of no more than four colors</p>
<p>The value of each color is about one yuan</p>
<p>Completely domestic goods</p>
<p>If the gifts sent by others are more than four colors, and the value is more than four or five yuan, then I would rather send some first and send the rest back later.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't have to accept all the gifts that are sent, and return a few. If there are several kinds of imported goods, then I will honestly and unceremoniously return these imported goods, only accepting domestic goods, indicating that I don't like to use immoral goods. That way, the other person will never send foreign goods again in the second year.</p>
<p>When I send gifts to others, in addition to never buying foreign goods, I also choose cheap and good domestic goods that I have used myself. If a domestic goods factory invents a new product, and it has been proven to be very reliable, I will buy it and send it to others to show promotion and introduce it.</p>
<p>I think that if everyone can follow my creed of promoting domestic goods when giving New Year gifts, then at least a certain amount of money can be sent to foreigners less in the annual New Year!</p>
<h3>New Year Cake</h3>
<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>New Year cake is one of the New Year gifts between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, taking its homophony with the words "nian gao" (年高), which is consistent with the auspicious saying "one year is higher than another."</p>
<p>New Year cake is made of glutinous rice and is purely domestic goods, never stained with any foreign air, which is commendable.</p>
<p>New Year cake is only made once a year. After it is made at the end of the year, it can be stored for a long time. Some people leave it until the second or third day of the new year before eating it, which is commendable.</p>
<p>New Year cake can be given to relatives and friends as a New Year gift, and can also be used as porridge, rice, and snacks, which is commendable.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of New Year cakes, including osmanthus New Year cake, with the ones sold in Suzhou being the best, rose lard New Year cake, osmanthus white sugar lard New Year cake with lard bean paste filling, jujube paste walnut lard New Year cake, glutinous rice New Year cake (Haining is the best), and Shangyu New Year cake (produced in Shangyu County, Shaoxing, also known as Shui Nian cake).</p>
<p>New Year cake can be eaten steamed, fried in oil, boiled in clear water, fried with leek sprouts, shredded pork, and eggs, boiled with chicken soup, cabbage, and dried shrimp, baked, or cut into thin slices, dried in the wind, and then scorched with oil. However, lard New Year cake can only be steamed, and Shangyu New Year cake is best fried with ingredients.</p>
<p>However, New Year cake made in the twelfth lunar month can be stored for a long time and will not spoil. Therefore, in any place, New Year cake is generally made after the Great Cold and before the Beginning of Spring. As for the end of the Gregorian calendar year, there are very few people who make New Year cake. Regarding this point, I have to add a statement to show the truth.</p>
<h3>Diary</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Haha! The New Year is coming soon! Hurry up and think of some gifts to give to good relatives and friends!</p>
<p>Give something to eat! It's finished in your mouth, it's really meaningless. Give some clothes to wear! I don't know what other people like, and it's too expensive. Give something to use! I don't know what he lacks, and I can't think of something suitable for a while.</p>
<p>Oh! I got it! Give him a diary! This thing is cheap and practical. You can buy it in any bookstore, and it's also a domestic product. It's beautiful in many ways! Good! I'm going to buy a few copies to give to relatives and friends!</p>
<p>Everyone! Don't underestimate the diary. Give it to him and tell him to write a diary every day. He will surely "improve his virtues and cultivate his joy." Many great Confucians in the past wrote diaries, and Zeng Guofan, the most famous in the Qing Dynasty, was an example. Not to mention the old concepts; but to look at it from a new perspective, writing a diary also has many benefits. A person's life is not always on the right track? How diligent or lazy are you in doing things? You often don't know, but if you write it down every day, and then read it later, you will definitely be alert to your mistakes and improve them, this is the first point. People's brainpower and memory are limited. It is easy to forget things that you have done before, but if you have a diary, you can compare what you have done before with what you have done today, and it is also very interesting, this is the second point. Also, writing a diary every day not only improves your writing and makes your calligraphy beautiful, but also cultivates the habit of "perseverance" and "diligence," which indirectly helps to cultivate morality, this is the third point.</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise all readers that the best New Year's gift is a diary. Although the price is not expensive and people don't like it very much, "a gentleman loves others with virtue." After receiving this gift, people will definitely be very grateful to you! If you don't believe me, you can try it and see.</p>
<h3>What We Need: "Foolish Hard Work"!</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Recently, after reading a piece by the late Mr. Ge Gongzhen, "A Glimpse of the Recent Lives of the Soviet People," I was deeply impressed by the spirit of the Soviets in using domestic goods. When he first arrived in the Soviet Union, the tea prepared in restaurants was actually just a cup of colored water, not only without any tea flavor but also somewhat astringent. It was said to be a mixture of another kind of leaf and tea leaves. As for coffee, it was said to be made from a kind of bean, simply a cup of dark brown sweet tea. They could be said to have gone to great lengths to avoid using foreign goods.</p>
<p>Who doesn't like comfort? It is certainly more comfortable to use exquisite foreign goods than domestic ones. However, before using them, everyone should think carefully: buying this imported product means flowing more money to foreign countries and supporting more foreigners. Conversely, buying some domestic goods means supporting the workers in domestic factories and opening up some paths for the future of China's national industry. Then, you will feel that using Chinese goods is far superior to imported goods. If the Chinese people develop this kind of mentality, I dare say that no matter how foreign goods invade our markets, we will not suffer any losses!</p>
<p>The people of the Soviet Union are not fools. They do not enjoy foreign coffee, but they understand more deeply that saving a penny for foreigners can reduce the country's strength by one point. This spirit of foolish hard work is truly admirable. Looking back at China, according to customs investigations, the amount of foreign coffee and other beverages imported each</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>year is more than one million yuan. What do Chinese people think after reading this?</p>
<p>In fact, Chinese tea is also a good beverage. It is just that the Chinese people worship "coffee," so the future of the tea industry is very bleak. If the Chinese people had the same determination as the Soviet people, it would not be difficult to save it. The tea industry is like this, and so are other industries!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, in a speech at the International Hotel's send-off for female athletes of the National Games, criticized the hotel for using non-Chinese basins, tablecloths, black tea with milk, and even paper. This is our common shame! Indeed, the masses have forgotten "foolish hard work," and everyone loves comfort and happiness, so domestic goods are naturally rejected.</p>
<p>Friends! The recent currency reform and concentration of silver by the government are giving our national industry a good opportunity for development. May the Chinese people change their habit of worshiping foreign goods and take on some responsibility for the future of the country. Let us all learn from the Soviet people's spirit of using domestic goods!</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui taught us to "work hard, work practically, work painstakingly." Now, let's add "foolish hard work." The more foolishly we work, the more hope the country has. Patriotic Chinese people! Let's work foolishly!</p>
<h3>Some Suggestions for Future National Product Exhibitions</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>I think everyone knows what the original intention of holding national product exhibitions is. Because of the backwardness of Chinese production and the fact that general industries are undoubtedly still in their infancy, the holding of national product exhibitions, on the one hand, is to inform the people of the whole country about the recognition of domestic goods, and from recognition, a strong belief arises. On the other hand, domestic goods factories themselves can take this opportunity to broadly observe the situation in various markets, how the public needs to improve domestic goods products, work hard to improve and expand their business. This is purely a work that should focus on publicity and not be eager for immediate gains.</p>
<p>However, recently, many unfortunate news have been heard about this meaningful and valuable work in the past. What national product exhibitions caused heavy disputes with local business circles due to low-price dumping! (In Nantong and Huzhou, there were even tragic incidents of bloodshed.) What national product exhibitions were organized by vendors and had no real manufacturers! What foreign goods were found in national product exhibitions! The misfortunes of national product exhibitions have reached this point, which clearly shows us that the recent national product exhibitions have actually lost their most fundamental function. Only because many manufacturers in Shanghai have surplus goods, or because general vendors profit from them, they dump goods in the interior, taking the opening of national product exhibitions as the only outlet. Therefore, goods are dumped in the interior one after another at the lowest prices, confusing the local market. Naturally, it is no wonder that the local business circles will launch a wave of competition and various twists and turns will occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that for future national product exhibitions, first of all, it is hoped that the participating manufacturers will be organized. Before going to various places to hold exhibitions, it is necessary to have considerable consultations with local officials and people, and strictly ban vendors with speculative natures from participating. At the same time, everyone should have a broader vision and fundamentally understand the meaning of holding exhibitions. We should not aim solely at seeking immediate gains in one place. We must ensure that the people in that place have a good and deep impression of domestic goods products, which is enough. After the closing of the national product exhibition, there are still two fundamental tasks that need to be worked hard on. Now, I will write them down for reference:</p>
<p>First, establish permanent institutions. After the national product exhibition, the situation in the area can be observed, and domestic goods manufacturers can independently establish distribution centers, or several factories can jointly establish domestic goods joint ventures and domestic goods companies, etc., to jointly carry out institutions for permanent business.</p>
<p>Second, contact local substantial vendors. We should choose local substantial and reliable vendors or consumer cooperatives, etc., and contact them with utmost sincerity, strictly enter into contracts, and specialize in selling domestic goods. After the closing of the national product exhibition, they can continue to order from Shanghai manufacturers.</p>
<p>In short, we must make the national product exhibition a bridge for promoting domestic goods to the inland market. It has the task of promoting domestic goods and revitalizing the entire [illegible]!</p>
<h3>A Proposal to Urgently Establish a Photographic Materials Factory</h3>
<p>— Ye Yigu</p>
<p>In recent years, China's domestic goods industry can be said to have made great progress. Because of the progress of the domestic goods industry, the foreign goods that Chinese people used to use are now replaced by good goods that they can make themselves, so everyone has unanimously abandoned foreign goods and loves to use domestic goods. If you want to find a few examples to illustrate this, then just take the matches, soap, and cotton textiles that we usually use, and you can imagine the general situation. Because in the past, the matches we used mostly belonged to several countries such as Sweden, but now China's Da Zhonghua, Da Hua, and other factories have gradually defeated imported matches. As for soap, cotton textiles, etc., in recent years, the rise of Chinese factories related to soap, cotton textiles, etc., has indeed been as vigorous as mushrooms after rain.</p>
<p>However, having said that, if we think back again, in the current situation where the domestic goods industry is gradually developing, are there still things in our daily necessities that cannot be replaced by domestic goods industrial products? The answer to this question can naturally be said to be many!</p>
<p>Photographic materials, such as the films and plates used, as well as cameras and their accessories, etc., are not things that everyone must use every day, but in terms of their indirect relationship, photos of people, photos of scenery, photos in books and magazines, etc., mostly have a relationship with everyone, or are seen. Now let's look at its import volume:</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, the import of photographic materials has recently seen a sharp increase. The import value of film and printing paper alone in the first seven months of this year (January to July) reached 1,064,732 gold units, which is equivalent to 2,129,464 yuan in national currency. Other items such as photographic equipment and accessories for various lenses are also considerable.</p>
<p>Looking at such a statistic, it is indeed shocking. Moreover, in terms of the types of emerging industrial products in China, there is no photography item that can replace it.</p>
<p>I heard that the National Games will be held in Shanghai this time, and just taking the photography item as an example, two photographic studios have contracted it for 3,000 yuan; from this, it can be seen that the consumption of photographic materials must also be very alarming.</p>
<p>However, I hope that the general industrialists in China and the pioneers who are enthusiastic about the domestic goods movement can pay more attention to this; think of a way, make a plan, and establish a factory that supplies photographic materials. Of course, the government authorities should also do their best to assist in the success of such a large investment, so that huge amounts of money will not flow overseas.</p>
<h3>We Must Use Domestic Paper</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Better to Cherish Paper than Words</p>
<p>One day, the newspaper reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Construction recently received a request from the Chinese Paper Plate Industry Federation to order the ban of the Word Cherishing Society; the reason was "The raw material for making paper plates, waste paper is also a major essential item"; the general idea was: "In this era of enlightenment, there should be no superstitious concepts. Waste paper should be sold to factories to be used as raw materials for paper making. On the factory side, waste can be used, reducing imported raw materials. On the other side, money can be earned to supplement livelihood." The provincial government, after reading the reasons for the association's request, found it very sufficient and immediately approved it; and ordered "all counties to ban the original Word Cherishing Society in accordance with the order, to save efforts and eliminate bad habits," etc. I think this approach is very much in favor, why? Because the original intention of "cherishing words" was originally in "cherishing paper." Not only is making a piece of paper not an easy matter, but everyone should truly love it; once it has been written on, then it must not be without use. If it is arbitrarily trampled on or torn apart for no reason, this is called "wasting God's creations," and asking one's conscience, how can one bear it? Therefore, the original meaning of "cherishing words" and the fact of "cherishing paper" can be said to be no different, not two things.</p>
<p>For example, decades ago, not only was publishing a book not a convenient thing, but making a ream of paper was also very difficult. Because the use of machinery had not yet been invented, things made by manual labor must be cherished. To put it simply, the reading books used in private schools often see books that fathers have read. Although they are very old, their sons can still use them as reading books. Isn't this a clear proof? Some people do not understand the principle of "cherishing words," which is "cherishing paper," and entangle "cherishing words" with "academic fame," creating many absurd stories of cause and effect; thus, the original intention of "cherishing paper" is forgotten. On the surface, it is called "cherishing words," but the result, regardless of importance, takes "words" and "paper" and puts them all to the torch. Not enough, when it has become ashes, it must be thrown into the sea before it is considered to be a complete merit. Isn't this a laughable and ridiculous thing!</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, try to go to the temples everywhere to see, isn't there a "Word Cherishing Pavilion"? All charities preside over it, and the waste paper that people collect is always collected and burned with blazing flames and rising smoke. Therefore, not only do you see people on the road carrying baskets and loads specializing in collecting waste paper for a living, but even the elderly do not hesitate to stoop and pick up waste paper and put it in cloth bags, as a sign of cultivation; however, those who pick it up still pick it up, and those who discard it still discard it. If you want to say that it is "cherishing words," dare to say that there is no impact at all; moreover, the current situation is even worse. The youth who do not have superstitions think that since the waste paper has been discarded, what use is there? Using waste paper to wipe feces, filling pits and valleys, also feels too unconscious, because they do not know that "cherishing words" is okay, but not knowing "cherishing paper" is really unreasonable; in recent years, no matter which school or institution, humorous people often regard it as "a place for making waste paper," which is really true. The more advanced personnel affairs, the more troublesome the documents, the more the need, the easier it is to discard, then, I think that at this time of all decline, material resources have been exhausted, the "words" originally do not need to be expressed, but must know that "paper" must not be wasted, especially the discarded paper with words, it is not useless, but it still has a price, instead of burning it for nothing, it is better to accumulate it and supply it to the paper making industry to use, isn't that much better? In the future, the paper used does not rely on foreign goods, but the paper factories of our country itself have enough raw materials to meet the demand, alas! It is not in other far-reaching plans, but in the waste paper that everyone does not pay attention to and casually throws away.</p>
<h3>A Musical Comedy</h3>
<p>— Ju Lu</p>
<p>In this year, the standard of living is getting higher day by day, and people's material enjoyment must be the most comfortable. The import of foreign goods is also increasing year by year—finally, the entire national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy! The weather has turned into early winter, and the climate is gradually getting colder. When I returned home from the office, I saw my wife sitting by the window knitting a woolen coat for Ming'er. I thought of this woolen yarn, all of which are foreign goods. I had seen it in the customs' trade statistics book. The annual import quantity is worth more than 10 million yuan in national currency, which is also a big leak! "You bought foreign goods again, hurting your own life money!" Whenever I saw my wife buying foreign goods, my opening words were always these few sentences. Then, when I was about to persuade her again, my wife had already stood up with a smile, "Your vision is really good, it's foreign goods again!" Her words were always playful like this. Then she threw the yarn ball in her hand to me, "Look, what country is this goods from?" I saw on the trademark, written "Queen Brand Cashmere Lustrous Yarn!" "Produced by China Woolen Textile Factory," I laughed, I quickly returned this yarn to my wife with comfort, and asked her, "Where did you buy it from?"</p>
<p>"It's getting cold, I thought Ming'er's coat for tomorrow is broken, so yesterday I went to the China National Goods Company to see what could be done. When I got there, the first thing I saw was the yarn counter. I also wanted to knit a yarn for him again. So I carefully selected it: I saw a kind written Queen Brand Cashmere Lustrous Yarn, the texture is very soft, even the most famous old brand foreign goods can only look up to it. The color is also very bright, so I bought a pound and a half. When I got home, I immediately started knitting. Now it has been knitted. I remember that I used an old brand foreign goods for Ming'er before, which actually required a pound and a half. Who knew that I also bought a pound and a half this time, but now there is still more than half left. It turns out that the Queen Brand Cashmere Lustrous Yarn is very light, so the size is much longer, and the price is not more expensive than foreign goods. It can really be said to be cheap and good quality, a masterpiece in domestic goods. Now are you happy!" My wife was so excited that she looked at me with a smile like a warrior who had won a victory.</p>
<p>"Good, I hope you don't buy foreign goods anymore!" I had nothing else to say. In fact, my heart was much happier than hers. In this year, in the domestic woolen spinning industry, the Queen's Cashmere Lustrous Yarn can be regarded as emitting a different light!</p>
<p>A musical comedy ends here.</p>
<p>Two New Inventions</p>
<h3>Huang Huaiying Invented "Nian Si Printing Plate"</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese people's interest in scientific research has become increasingly strong, so the new inventions have also increased day by day. This can be said to be on the one hand the active progress of our country's scientific community. On the one hand, the future of the domestic goods industry is unlimited.</p>
<p>Recently announced new inventions by Chinese people, including Tan Yutian's DC to AC total pressure machine, Xu Boyun's artificial gasoline, Yin Zhengheng's new-style cotton gin, etc., there are as many as twenty-eight kinds. This cannot be said to be a very good harvest. But there are many objects that have been invented by the Chinese but have not been announced yet! The "Nian Si Printing Plate" recently invented by Mr. Huang Huaiying, which is discussed in this article, is one of them. Now I dare to borrow a corner of valuable space in the domestic goods section to report to readers who are enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods.</p>
<p>The inventor, Mr. Huang, is a well-known figure in the printing industry in Beiping. In order to seek further study, he went to Japan to specialize in printing and plate making and gained a great reputation. After returning to China, he set up a plate making specialty school in Beiping to train professionals. At the same time, he continued to study, painstakingly managed, and after many experiments, finally invented the latest "Nian Si Printing Plate." According to Mr. Huang: "After returning to China from the East, I felt that the printing plates used in the country were divided into categories, and the prices varied greatly, so I decided to improve them. After more than five years of research and one hundred and twenty-seven experiments, it was finally successful in the autumn of this year (24th year). In order to commemorate this printing plate, it is specially named "Nian Si Printing Plate." This plate does not undergo corrosion on the surface, and can be printed on a lead printing machine, even the exquisite and expensive engraving plate, this plate can also replace it." Indeed, this kind of printing plate has been proven to be extremely economical and durable, and the materials used are all domestic products, which is cheaper than zinc and copper plates. It is a new discovery in the scientific community and domestic goods community. It is heard that Mr. Huang will apply to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a patent in the near future.</p>
<h3>Invention of Medicine Battery Safety Lamp</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>There is a Zhu Jianlin in Nanhui, who comes from industry, and spent more than a year's hard work to invent a medicine battery safety lamp. It has now been successfully tested. The lamp is economical and simple, and suitable for the needs of today's society. Even in villages without electric lights, it can be used. A few days ago, Zhu Jun submitted a document to the Industrial Division of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with instructions, drawings, etc., requesting the Ministry to set a date for inspection. After receiving the submission, the Ministry handed it over to experts for review, who considered it to be of test value and approved Zhu Jun to immediately bring the invention to Beijing to wait for an audience in order to explain everything and implement the inspection. If it can meet the practical use, he will be granted a patent for a certain number of years to show encouragement.</p>
<p>New News About Domestic Goods in One Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ninety-three Trade Association issued a declaration, requesting the government to make the final and greatest determination to safeguard the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty. All industries vowed to be the government's support.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has negotiated with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board to borrow one million yuan for the construction of the China Paper Company factory, and it has been settled.</p>
<p>Shanghai's various domestic goods organizations have sent telegrams to congratulate the newly appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce, Wu Dingchang. Wu said that he would not talk about plans, but would work hard.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has approved the exemption of export tax for Qian Jie hairnets.</p>
<p>The Chinese Engineers Association invited Mr. Lu Zhixue of Wuzhou Guben Factory to speak on the Chinese soap industry, presided over by President Wang Shengsheng.</p>
<p>China Chemical Industry Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Jinhua Enamel Factory, Yaguang Bakelite Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Hongxin Cloth Factory, Wuzhou Socks Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, etc. organized a joint business office in Nanzhi Central Market, and hired Zhao Yuanliang as director.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association sent members to unite various organizations to discuss ways to promote domestic goods next year.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Manufacturers United Association has decided on Lujiabang Road Life Release Bureau as the Shanghai South Domestic Goods Movement Exhibition Ground, which will open on New Year's Day and start registration immediately.</p>

<p>Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>The Publishing Industry Should Grasp National Justice</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>The fall of the Northeast caused my publishing industry, which was under development, to lose a huge market. Undoubtedly, the so-called autonomous movement in the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar is a major blow to my publishing industry, which is in a slump. But in addition to the economic blow, the impact it has on our national psychology is particularly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Beijing and Tianjin are not only the center of my northern academic culture, but simply the center of my entire country. Early on, we heard that the textbooks there must be revised to meet the purpose of friendship. Of course, with the emergence of the puppet-style autonomous movement, this method of eliminating national consciousness will have more development. Therefore, our declining publishing industry, for economic and political reasons, had no choice but to give up its mission of promoting national culture and submit to violence. Because the publishing industry is a mirror that reflects the national psychology, this meaning is very important, indicating that the national independence movement has encountered a major failure in the national psychology.</p>
<p>And from this influence on the national psychology, the result is that right and wrong are not distinguished, evil and righteousness are not recognized, and those who recognize thieves as fathers and take traitors as glory will emerge one after another. If we add the policy of seeking perfection in politics and the appointment of officials must be based on the enemy's intention, so that those who are connected with the enemy can achieve rapid success, then I am afraid that we will be psychologically people of a perished country before the enemy's planes and cannons arrive. From this North China incident, traitorous groups such as the Asia Association rose up one after another, which fully demonstrates the seriousness of its meaning. And observing the current publishing industry, we can know the future from the small, such as specializing in reprinting ancient books in recent years, but not paying attention to the introduction of new knowledge, which cannot be said to be an act of escaping reality. We know that only the British in Hong Kong and the Japanese in my eastern province advocate reading the classics and talk nonsense about "kingly culture."</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time, our publishing industry bears a very important task in maintaining a glimmer of hope for the national independence consciousness. We must recognize that with the shrinking of the national territory and the shrinking of the market, our publishing industry shares the same fate as the country and the nation. Before the day of the invasion of a strong enemy, this is the disaster of our nation and the suffering period of our publishing industry. The publisher's efforts in the national independence movement are not only for the nation, but also for the future of his own publishing business. Therefore, in the face of the current crisis, the only important thing for our publishers, I think, should be the grasp of "national justice." We can only use this lamp of "national justice" to illuminate the conspiracies of the traitors and emit a ray of light for the national independence consciousness.</p>
<p>But the task of grasping "national justice" by the so-called publishers ultimately depends on the joint promotion of writers, intellectuals, students, and youth before it can be effective. Therefore, our student movement, youth movement, and all cultural and ideological movements are inevitably two sides of the same coin with the publishing industry. And criticizing traitors and establishing national justice is undoubtedly also an important project in all our movements. Wen Tianxiang said: "Heaven and earth have righteousness, which is called vastness in people." The place where this vast righteousness lies is in our publishers, writers, students, and youth, and when the crisis of national survival is at stake, we must be able to have a firm grasp of this before we can concretize abstract national justice into the fact of unity and independence.</p>
<h3>Students' Awareness and Goals in the National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>— Li Jianfang</p>
<p>Since the students in Beiping opposed all forms of disguised puppet autonomy under the banner of upholding national unity and integrity, students in various other regions have also expressed their national salvation sentiments. According to reports, students in Guangzhou have been on strike for a week, and students in Hangzhou braved wind and snow to parade in the streets to awaken the public's attention to the nation's survival. In recent days, students from public and private schools in Shanghai and Wuhan have issued passionate declarations to support the students in Beiping. All of these indications cannot but acknowledge the revival of the student movement, which has been dormant for many years.</p>
<p>However, considering the current environment in which students find themselves, we should not be too optimistic about the students. Regardless of how pure the student movement is, how free from partisan affiliations, and how much we hope the student movement can expand greatly, negotiation will not be easy. Firstly, political interference is almost inevitable. Secondly, the weakness of the public's responsiveness to current politics and the disorganization of organizations will inevitably leave the nascent student movement in a state of isolation and helplessness.</p>
<p>It is true that in the past few days, there has been no shortage of people in the education community expressing solidarity with the students. However, this is only temporary and superficial. When the student national salvation movement takes on its usual form and organizational structure, corrupt and bureaucratic educators will inevitably find the student movement a headache. Therefore, educators remain an obstacle to the student national salvation movement.</p>
<p>However, if the student masses have a correct understanding of the current historical situation and goals, the potential of the current student movement is unlimited.</p>
<p>The first recognition that student youth should have of the current historical situation is that the unification movement of the Chinese nation is the key to the survival of the Chinese nation in the future. All classes and individuals in Chinese society must regard national unity as their immediate central task and understand that unity is the prerequisite for all future social movements. Without this prerequisite, it is truly a case of "if the skin does not exist, what will the fur adhere to?"</p>
<p>We must know that China has had many opportunities to be subjugated and destroyed in the past century. However, the reason why China has not been completely subjugated to this day is due to the accidental changes in international history, not to the country's own strength.</p>
<p>China could have completely become a second India after the Opium War. However, the reason why it did not become a second India at that time was not because China had more resistance than India when it was subjugated, but because India was subjugated during the era of commercial capital dominance, while the Opium War era was during the era of liberal dominance. Therefore, as long as China allowed capitalist countries, especially Britain, to freely open treaty ports and trade freely, capitalist countries would have been satisfied and would not have needed to personally rule such a large territory. Therefore, China was spared from subjugation. This was an accidental change in international history that saved China for the first time.</p>
<p>The second critical moment when China should have been subjugated was during the period after the Sino-Japanese War and before the Second Revolution. This stage was precisely when the Chinese nation was transitioning from historical centripetal force to historical centrifugal force, that is, the era when the warlord separatism situation formed and reached its peak. At this time, as long as the magic power of an international power extended into China, the Chinese nation would not only have been unable to offer any resistance, but the internal separatist movement would have greatly aided the victory and rule of foreign races (the current autonomous movement in the North is a clear example). However, the reason why China was not subjugated during this period must be attributed to the balance of power among the Pacific powers during this period. This was an accidental change in international history that saved China for the second time.</p>
<p>However, since the September 18th Incident, this balance of power in the Pacific, which had long guaranteed China's superficial independence in the past, has been broken, and with the opposition between Britain and the United States and the internal troubles in Europe, the destruction of this balance of power has only increased. This means that China can no longer obtain assistance and guarantee from accidental international relations. However, just as this accidental international guarantee relationship was lost, the Chinese nation itself prematurely underwent a historical transformation with a glimmer of hope. What is this transformation with a glimmer of hope? It is that the Chinese nation, since the Second Revolution, has once again moved from a centrifugal force movement to a centripetal force movement, that is, from division to unity. Although this is still a work in progress, this transformation is the guarantee for the Chinese nation to avoid subjugation in the future. Therefore, from this transformation, the XX imperialists' invasion of China this time not only recognizes that China is currently deceivable, but also that China will be so in the future.</p>
<p>If we say that the XX imperialists' attitude towards China now is similar to France's attitude towards Germany before the Franco-Prussian War, then China's decision towards the XX imperialists must also take the decision of Germany towards France at that time. That is, it should move from an internal unification movement to a counterattack against foreign races. Therefore, the internal unification movement cannot but be the only force and absolute means for resisting foreign races. Those who ignore this decision, no matter what position they speak from, are, in my opinion, out of step with the times.</p>
<p>Our young students must recognize the following truth: that if a nation's internal self-interest, that is, the development of special interests that replace the development of common interests, is not divided, then there is absolutely no power that can oppose the development of this nation or exert its destructive power within it. Conversely, if the development of special interests exceeds the development of common interests, then the intrusion of external forces is only the inevitable result of this phenomenon. Therefore, opposing and attacking the current development of special interests and leading the country to the path of unity is the main task of the nation now.</p>
<p>However, for the nation to rise up to oppose selfish elements and selfish groups in the nation, the nation must first have the freedom of political activity. Therefore, China's unity, liberation, and democracy are essentially a trinity.</p>
<p>We must know that true unity is by no means fractional cooperation or a gathering of giants with their own interests in mind. True unity lies in having a provision and adherence to the rights and obligations between classes, between the government and the people, between localities and the central government, that comes from the will of the people. This provision and adherence to the will of the people is always the only guarantee for the country to embark on organic development.</p>
<p>The reason why the student movement in the past few years has been silent and unknown is that political interference is the biggest reason. However, the fact that students themselves only have partisan divisions and lack clear understanding and unified goals is also one of the reasons for the decline of the student movement. Therefore, if the student movement in the future does not want to die prematurely, and if it does not want to disperse without results, it must have a clear political understanding and a unified goal.</p>
<p>With a clear political understanding and a unified goal, the student movement is not a simple student movement, it should be the vanguard of the entire national movement.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Bookstore Scenes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>This is not intentionally boasting about the proofreaders in bookstores. In fact, proofreading is indeed a job that requires considerable skill. Proofreaders certainly do not need to be scholars or experts, but academic ability above the secondary level and literary ability are essential. Ideally, the proofreader for a particular type of book should have some knowledge of that field of study, which can be helpful for the proofreading work. A conscientious proofreader can not only see the original manuscript clearly and ensure that the proof matches the original, but also be aware of any errors in the original and correct them within a reasonable scope.</p>
<p>What is the situation of proofreaders in various bookstores now? Because proofreaders are not as famous as editors-in-chief, we cannot describe them individually. However, generally speaking, the status of proofreaders is very low, only slightly higher than that of ordinary store clerks. Some bookstores even do not hire proofreaders, and the responsibility of proofreading is shared by everyone from the editor-in-chief to the apprentices. As a result, it is even more difficult to distinguish between ordinary editors and proofreaders. Some people call themselves editors, but in fact they are just proofreaders. People generally believe that proofreading is close to academic work and that the academic ability of proofreaders can easily improve. However, even if a book is proofread two or three times, it is difficult for the proofreader to understand what the book is about (mainly because the work is intermittent). However, compared to ordinary store clerks, proofreaders naturally have more opportunities for advancement.</p>
<h3>Safeguarding Freedom of Opinion and Publication</h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>Since the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Fifth National Congress, Zhou Fo Hai and 56 other members of the Central Committee proposed that the National Government issue a nationwide order to earnestly safeguard legitimate public opinion and effectively improve news inspection methods, according to the Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th, the National Government issued an instruction on the 10th to all directly subordinate agencies to comply and earnestly safeguard legitimate public opinion.</p>
<p>Naturally, the proposal to safeguard legitimate public opinion by Zhou Fo Hai and 56 other members of the Central Committee this time, and the implementation of this proposal by the National Government and the order to resume the publication of the Ta Kung Pao, are very clear and important manifestations of the government's fulfillment of its long-standing promises. Under this manifestation, we hope that in the near future, the concrete protection of journalists and the improvement of news inspection methods can be effectively implemented; and the shortcomings of "imperfect implementation in various regions" will no longer occur, and the disappointment of the people will not increase!</p>
<p>Although, to this day, safeguarding public opinion is the unanimous demand of the whole country; however, the principle of freedom of publication is obviously a check that must also be cashed at present.</p>
<p>For several years, the weakness and powerlessness of the publishing industry, and the apathy of the general literati, youth and students, are all sufficient to show that China is prematurely aging. This premature aging phenomenon is certainly due to the lack of correct scientific knowledge among the general new and old intellectuals in China, and the lack of scientific worldviews, social views and views on life; but the most important point is indeed due to the government's failure to cash its promise to guarantee the freedom of public opinion and the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Because without scientific knowledge, they cannot fully understand the internal struggles of imperialism and the causal relationship of invading colonies; without recognizing this causal relationship, they cannot obtain a concrete understanding of the general war situation; without this concrete understanding, they cannot calmly meet the war and not be afraid of danger. The moving movement of the general literati before the recent period is sufficient to prove that these elements lack scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>At the same time, because they do not have correct worldviews, social views and views on life, they cannot embrace the spirit of great fearlessness and the determination to fight together with the country and the nation. For several years, the result of the general new and old talents talking about snakes and ghosts, reading scriptures and reciting Buddha, has made most young people only know how to escape reality, be selfish and self-interested, powerless and useless; and do not know how to lead the masses, organize the masses and educate the masses, in order to win the survival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Since the general modern intellectuals and scholars have completely exposed the phenomenon of empty talk that misleads the country, and the government authorities and the general local military men cannot give the publishing industry sufficient freedom; then, the imprisonment of the thinking of the general youth in the dark ages will naturally aggravate the role of talking about snakes and ghosts and the crisis of scientific knowledge. Therefore, under the conditions of safeguarding public opinion and guiding national thought today, fully granting the freedom of the publishing industry and the freedom to study realistic knowledge is the main factor in transforming the current national thought.</p>
<p>Because if the publishing industry and the reading world, which have the greatest influence on the thinking of the general people, cannot fully obtain the freedom of publication and research in the face of this backward and sluggish crisis in front of us, then the impact will make the publishers who preside over the publishing industry have to publish a large number of books that violate the times and are used by the government under the conditions of "avoiding misfortune and seeking good fortune"; and the general young people who take the study of mechanics as their ambition will have to tend to the empty talk of ghosts and playthings to lose their aspirations. What's more, many backward literati are using "Mingde" and "preaching" as a stepping stone in various places; and new-style writers are groping blindly, drinking wine and playing with chrysanthemums, which has created a dark age in the Chinese ideological and cultural circles! In front of this dark age of culture and thought, who has the power to rise up to resist the enemy and defend against insults!</p>
<p>Therefore, standing on the position of the entire national rebirth, and standing on the position of the revival of the Chinese cultural movement, we believe that the way to restore our national self-confidence is to fully grant absolute freedom to the publishing industry and the reading world; and there is nothing more than banning all the "swindling" of the restoration movement and the scripture reading movement. In recent years, the result of advocating preserving morality, preserving national quintessence, and worshiping idols has not only not produced any great cultural guides and national heroes, but on the contrary, it has produced villains like Yin Rugeng, who betrayed the motherland, and the cultural rogues in Shanghai who ran away before they saw the enemy. Where is the great (?) Yue Wumu? Where is the commendable Wen Tianxiang? If it were not for the students of various schools in Beiping who first launched the anti-autonomous movement, I am afraid that the glory of the Chinese nation in the past and the glory of the cultural movement since the "May Fourth" have been completely lost by this group of failed elements in Shanghai who fled at the first sign of trouble!</p>
<p>Therefore, another task of today's national rejuvenation and safeguarding of public opinion is to open up the freedom of the publishing industry and the reading world. If the military politicians in various places want to continue to imprison the people's thoughts and prevent the people's freedom of research at this time, then we believe that under the current wave of regeneration of this student movement, not only will the ruling authorities have to increase a kind of object to be coerced; but the future cultural vitality will also be completely lost. Therefore, we hope that under today's policy of safeguarding public opinion, the freedom of the publishing industry and the reading world can also be fully liberated!</p>

<h3>Safeguarding Patriotic Movements</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>In the recent student movements in various places against autonomy in North China, we have seen that they have the same demand for the government in the newspapers: "Safeguard patriotic movements." This seems to be the unanimous expectation of students in various places. Patriotic movements, before the country has really fallen, are naturally not illegal from the standpoint of the people. School textbooks include the history of national humiliation and encourage students to work hard to save the country. The government has also repeatedly encouraged the people to resist for a long time. This should be said to be part of the patriotic movement. I think the government should give all guarantees to the people's patriotic movements. However, now students in various places still have to ask the government to guarantee patriotic movements, and they are "not guaranteed" by the police. According to reports, when students parade, the police rush to the scene in formation, "as if facing a formidable enemy." Those in the front row hold leather whips, the middle row is wooden boards, and the back is water pipes. If the leather whips are ineffective, they are followed by wooden boards. If the wooden boards are ineffective, they are followed by water. As a result, many students were injured. This has been made very clear in the newspapers. In the same newspaper, we also saw records of incidents such as a small number of "good people" in Tianjin being used to petition for autonomy and the establishment of an autonomy commando, but the police "had no conflict" with them and passed peacefully. This contrast makes us feel that it is better to be the latter than the former. From this point of view, today's patriotic movement inevitably has places that are not protected, and the so-called demands for autonomy and other treasonous movements can be freely carried out. Comparing these two events inevitably makes people feel too desolate!</p>
<p>No matter what, it is always heartbreaking that students demand guarantees for patriotic movements. No matter how we think about it, patriotism is not something that violates the law. Today's "national affairs" are like this. As long as we still have thoughts and a desire to survive, the current environment is forcing us to a dead end step by step. This situation is really heartbreaking!</p>
<h3>To the Hospital</h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>My wife has been pregnant for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Her good health is no longer as pleasing as before: mental fatigue, bloating, insomnia... These, these, ah...</p>
<p>Gradually, gradually, she is full of melancholy.</p>
<p>She likes to read books, but doesn't like to write articles. She likes to listen to people telling stories, but her own stories are suppressed in her heart. How boring is this? She has a deep, unspeakable silence.</p>
<p>The home is also becoming increasingly cold.</p>
<p>So, I suffer from the heavy sickness of the home.</p>
<p>Therefore, the labor of the home also falls on me: tidying up the house, sweeping the floor, lighting the stove, cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the toilet... I have to bear it all. I can no longer bear to hand over these trivial and unbearable things to my wife who is tormented by troubles. I feel that I can do it all myself, and do it with great interest. For example, when I used to cook, whenever I put the pot on the stove, I always watched it carefully, but after only a few minutes, a burnt smell would emanate from the pot. But now not only can't it be like that, but I'm sure to cook a pot of delicious rice. This is always a little experience, but why not everything on the stage of life?</p>
<p>I can bear the hardship, but I hope I have one.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Sitting in the outer room of the examination room, reading a newspaper I brought from home. Waiting, waiting, but not seeing my wife finish the examination, I was really a little impatient. The weather was so cold that sitting in the room was also shivering. Fortunately, when my wife came out, the first thing I asked was: "How is it? When will you give birth?" She smiled and said, "Soon, he said next month." As she spoke, she took out a prescription from her belt and said, "Let's go, we have to get the medicine." We walked towards the dispensing room. As she walked, she said, "The doctor said that since it's my first time giving birth, I have to have a blood test." I asked her, "So did you have it?" She tilted her head and said, "No. He said he wanted to test the blood, and I said okay, but then he told me that the blood test would cost two yuan. I thought to myself, God! That's two yuan! So, I told him I didn't bring any money. He told me to go again the day after tomorrow, or the day after that." I didn't say a word after hearing my wife's words. The shadow of two yuan was crawling in my heart.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the entrance of the dispensing room, we were stunned again. It turned out that the gentleman in charge of collecting the prescriptions asked us for one yuan and two mao for the medicine. I secretly looked at my wife and whispered in her ear, "What to do? I only have two mao in my pocket."</p>
<p>My wife smiled and said to the gentleman, "Give me the prescription first, and I'll come back later."</p>
<p>We walked out of the hospital dejectedly, our hearts chilled by the cold wind of December.</p>
<h3>Night of Melting Snow</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>Outside the window, the wind chased the downy snow, flying over the earth, between the planks, on the roof tiles, melting like dewdrops. There was no white snow.</p>
<p>Add some new coal, there are times when the stove is even more afraid of the cold than people. Because the bright color is saturated with a large amount of coldness!</p>
<p>The hollow stove, burning black and bright coal, emitting ginger-red flames and clear white smoke, naturally excludes loneliness and feels comfortable warmth.</p>
<p>But the night is cold and wet, the snow outside the window is falling like down, melting like dewdrops; my sleep is troubled, and there is an unavoidable cold and desolate feeling, which is more terribly severe than the winter night of melting snow.</p>
<p>Like a ghost, I propped myself up and sat on the bed. I was afraid of the loneliness of the winter night, more than the cold of the winter night.</p>
<p>—How can I warm myself?</p>
<p>I am a person who has written many news about snow, and I have brought those news to many friends who have never seen snow scenes; I boast to people like a person who can tell stories of polar expeditions. Isn't that so? In the first year I saw snow, I had a holy and beautiful feeling like Christmas!</p>
<p>(It's just that I have never used snow to sculpt a three-dimensional statue of a human face, and I have never learned to throw snowballs with children, and I still regret it.)</p>
<p>Like this kind of night, I used my fingers to smear away a layer of water vapor on the glass window, and I peeped at the snow outside the window through the gaps in the fingerprints.</p>
<p>My nose, for the sake of curiosity, pressed tightly against the glass of the window; my cheeks, for the sake of excessive excitement, appeared scorched red and dry.</p>
<p>So I lavishly told my friends, those people living in the equatorial zone. And tell a beautiful story of a snowy day.</p>
<p>But these are all outdated news and old stories. Because of many unsatisfactory encounters, I am calm, and the snow brings me a lot of loneliness.</p>
<p>Like the summit of a world, my memory is covered with three layers of perennial snow. When checking past memories, I am afraid of the loneliness of the night. More than the cold of the night.</p>
<p>The gorgeous mood no longer belongs to me, and I ask myself softly:</p>
<p>—How can I warm myself?</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Recently, there have been some good news in the film industry: First, "The Grand Family" and "Hero of the Times" have sold quite well; Second, the Star Film Company is said to have newly joined shares of 150,000 yuan, and the general factory photography studio, which has been rumored for a long time, has indeed had its "foundation laid" recently.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, there is no lewd performance in "Red Begonia" starring Bai Yushuang. Knowing full well that even if it were filmed, there would be many problems with etiquette.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>On the fifteenth, the camera was opened to correct the mistake: Wang Gong's shallow "aphorism" man." This man, this disease, if not for the "unmarried father-in-law," it would have long ceased to be "shallow."</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, and someone intends to write a chronicle of major events in the film world in 1935, thinking hard all day and getting the word "poor."</p>
<p>The "Grand Family" advertisement has "irrefutable facts, unable to overturn," and the so-called "irrefutable facts" are actually excerpts from Western newspapers such as the "organ of the American film industry overlord," the Great American Evening News, etc. Not a single film review from a Chinese newspaper is included, causing some to wonder if "Grand Family" is an American production.</p>
<p>Alas! The psychology of admiring foreigners has been the same since ancient times, and it is now extremely strong. No wonder someone on the Lianhua Pictorial wants to sigh about it!</p>
<p>Liang Saizhen's good friend (not Bai Nan) Wu Gongliande's "large" magazine Yitan, (some say "meat" altar) is said to be determined to cease publication and start a picture and text magazine, which has as many as ten editors. (Confucius said: Is this a harbinger of a "Good Friend" showdown?)</p>
<p>I heard that Huang Tianshi, who edits the Film Times, has not been to the Star office recently. I don't know what's wrong?</p>
<p>The Times reported: "Ouyang Yuqian will write the dialogue for Bai Yushuang's "Red Begonia" script. His past experience singing Qingyi will definitely achieve satisfactory results."</p>
<h3>Dream of Peach Blossoms, Beauties Like Clouds</h3>
<p>The Dream of Peach Blossoms sound film, which will be released at Jincheng these days, is the only masterpiece of the famous director Dan Duyu. It brings together no fewer than a thousand modern women, with wonderful dances like clouds and clear songs that intoxicate. It is also rich in allegory and cannot be compared to those who merely dazzle with excitement. The protagonist, Yin Mingzhu, leads the singing of the Laundress Song, which is truly wonderful. It is said that people in the film circle who have seen the trial film have praised it as the representative work of domestic song and dance films.</p>
<h3>New Film Introduction</h3>
<p>(1) Dream Ends, Soul Breaks</p>
<p>"Dream Ends, Soul Breaks" Peter Jbbetson is Paramount's most supreme sad love blockbuster of the year. The film tells the story of a pair of childhood sweethearts who, unfortunately, after growing up, fly to the north and south, but in the hearts of both of them, there is already a very deep impression. Later, although they meet again, the woman is unfortunately married. Because of work reasons, the two have many opportunities to get together, so the flames of love rekindle and cannot be extinguished. Later, the man accidentally kills the woman's husband and is arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. One is in prison and the other is elsewhere, but the love between the two can never be extinguished and they often meet in dreams. The plot of this film can be considered extremely bitter. The protagonists are Gary Cooper and Ann Harding.</p>
<p>(2) Love Only</p>
<p>The Cathay Theatre, in response to requests from all walks of life, will continue to show "A Midsummer Night's Dream" for three days. The next film to be released is a Warner Brothers blockbuster "I Live For Love." This is a new production by the big star Dolores del Río. The male lead, Marcel, is a red star on the New York stage. The perfection of his performance is a matter of course. As for the plot of the play, you only need to see the title to get a glimpse of it. Movie fans who haven't seen Dolores del Río's films for a long time will definitely be happy to hear this news. See "Triumphal Song" photography notes</p>
<h3>See "Triumphal Song" Photography Notes</h3>
<p>Hearing the news that "Triumphal Song" was filming a great scene of the Expo, I drove straight to Yihua Company in Jin Situ Temple.</p>
<p>Hey! Look! The entire Yihua Company is really occupied by general extras. Men, women, old and young, there are seven or eight hundred people.</p>
<p>These two days, the weather is already quite cold, but they are all only wearing a thin shirt, and they are all holding a fan in their hands, constantly fanning themselves to cool off. It is said that it is because of the plot. I pulled an old man and asked him if he was cold? He said that because he was too excited, he didn't feel cold.</p>
<p>This is indeed true. Even I, seeing that situation, felt great excitement! Look! Nearly a thousand flags fluttering in the wind all over the photography studio, three green dragons five or six feet long, and other toys such as tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, unicorns, big drum formations, silk and bamboo bands, stilt walkers, three iron roosters, and fishing and killing families... In short; the lively scene is truly beyond description.</p>
<p>The entire photography studio is also covered with the scenery used for this Expo, winding and winding, and Yihua Company has changed its appearance. If you don't know that it is a film company, I guarantee that you will be shocked when you walk in. Where did such a large village come from, and why is it so lively today?</p>
<p>Walking over and shaking hands with the old man, I learned that this Expo scene has been changed three times, and today is the last day. We still have to shoot until dawn tonight, and everyone needs to be naked in the evening. He said: "Everyone is willing to listen and is willing to work hard with us to the end." Finally, he said very emotionally: "The lives of artists are not comfortable!"</p>
<p>I stood in a place that did not hinder their work, and I was still reluctant to leave with a passionate mood until the sun set in the west and they stopped working.</p>
