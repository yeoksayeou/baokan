<p>時評</p>
<h3>銀行公會創辦銀行承兌滙票</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>市塲上籌碼之寛緊。固表現於數量。然其效能。不當從數量計。應從其運用計。運用而果自如。則籌碼雖少何礙。運用而失其靈敏。籌碼縱多奚益。若言數量之多寡。則美國號爲黃金王國。何解於前年金融恐慌。奉吉黑昔時發行票帖最多。而三省人民困苦不堪。凡此皆見籌碼之爲物。是在運用如何。而運用之能否裕如。又在一般之信用如何。在往昔工商業但憑一紙自己簽字蓋章之遠期支票。付於交貨之人。受者不之疑。屆期兌欵。亦無問題。年來則因種種關係。昔日之信用制度。幾乎完全破壞。而有調劑金融之責者。或則掯勒不放。或則以各方之緊縮。本身亦無可周轉。於是市面不得不陷於停滯。然此仍不能全謂爲籌碼之多寡問題。實爲一般之信用問題也。</p>
<p>信用不可以倖致。亦不可以豪。奪同一票據。昔則受之。今則拒之。或甲則拒之。乙則受之。此一受一拒之間。非票據之本身問題。實爲出票承兌人之信用問題。信用強。則期雖遠而人樂受。信用薄。卽許以卽期。人尚有所懷疑。故如何恢復市塲上之信用。卽如何消釋一般之惶慮。誠救濟工商業之一大前提也。迺者工商業貨欵。一切章則俱已公布。並有八月一日實行貸欵之說。此固工商業之福音。然有欵亦當善自運用。則一文錢庶有三文四文之作用。否則仍不足以紆今日之急。銀行公會有鑒於此。出而發行承兌匯票。此誠目前之要舉也。</p>
<p>據昨報載。銀行公會發行銀行承兌匯票。係由銀行準備委員會另設票據承兌所負責辦理之。凡工商客戶有確實之貨物者。可向該所請領承兌匯票。經所方估定價格後。開予相當銀額之匯票。卽可持向任何會員銀行貼現。同時信用方面。除特定之貨物爲實質之第一担保品外。並有銀行公會聯合準備庫所認定之基金爲第二担保。是則一紙匯票轉輾流通。必可發揮其籌碼之效用。其信用程度之堅強。自非一般所可企及也。</p>
<p>且此項承兌匯票。以分配於麵粉·花紗·雜糧·油類·水泥等國貨工廠產品並出口貨物爲限。要之。乃以發展國貨生產事業。及扶助出口爲其目的也。我國貨事業與出口事業之急待扶助。言者已多。今銀行公會創辦承兌匯票。明白規定其用途者如此。誠我國工商業發展之左券。吾人但冀其早日實行。以慰工商界之渴望耳。</p>

<h3>日陸軍將校大調動　正流派均任要職　多田峻精通我國情形　梅津調師團長之眞相</h3>
<p>（東京）陸軍人員調動命令業於二十二日下午發表、林陸相最以革除第二師團長秦眞次中將問題與教育總監眞崎意見衝突、陸相遂免眞崎之職、而依照其所計劃、革除就任不滿一年之秦中將、實行陸軍內部之統制、秦眞次·菱刈隆·及松井石根三要人之辭職爲今次調動中最堪注目之事、又濁汰菱刈及松井兩軍事參議官爲刷新陸軍內部之必要條件、又陸相本定昇任從來有種種風說之逮川第十師團長與小磯第五師團長、然爲避免多事計、暫時轉任參謀次長與航空本部長、擬於下次調動時、命任要職、陸相將所詣正流派之人物均集合於中央各要所、卽任命石原莞爾大佐爲參謀部作戰部長、石本大佐爲調查班長、影佐中佐爲滿蒙班長、又命花谷中佐就關連軍要職、總之、今次調動方針全部根據於林陸相之統制軍部政策、眞崎大將及秦中將等紊亂統制一派已經一掃、然爲避免刺戟此派之威情起見、中央首腦部不行調動梅津駐華軍司令、而昇任第二師團長、新任駐華軍司令之多田峻曾住中國甚久、係陸軍部內精通中國情形者之一、九一八役任　東軍司令部員兼任「滿洲國」軍政部顧問、今後其對華北實行如何政策、頗堪注目、（廿二日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）此次陸軍之大異動極爲各方面所注目、待命者如奏眞次中將、本爲問題之人尤惹人注意、預料必入中央軍部之小磯建川兩中將、竟未轉職、雖似感不足、然係林陸相以純正之立塲、不聽人言、故有此舉、眞崎大將及秦中將向被人批評之人、無論何人不敢更動之、此次竟毅然處理之、於統制內部有絕大之效果、卽此可謂已達到所期之目的、預料今後必漸次採超黨派合法之強硬政策、此次之英斷爲陸軍異動史上未曾有之事、卽將來亦有非想像所能及者、（二十三日　通社電）</p>
<h3>日軍更動內幕　統制派戰勝荒木派</h3>
<p>（東京）陸軍異動之經過茲詳述如下、因更迭教育總監之大英斷、當初期待過大、故一般頗感不滿、菱刈大將於十一月停年滿期、故爲大將級之待命、乃當然之順序、松井大將因在陸軍部內組織大亞細亞協會、與眞崎大將同遠反軍之統制、秦第二師團長之待命、由於林陸相與眞崎總監之意見不同、而林陸相敢於斷行此次之異動、乃有意義、繼秦中將後任之梅津中將、因其對於華北事件未有犧牲而收效果、故對其將來期待頗殷、滿洲事變之殊勳者歸國後伏居仙台之石原大佐轉入參謀本部、與關東軍參謀石本大佐轉任調查班長、同爲建設新興陸軍奠其大基要之此次之異動、更迭教育總監之英斷、未能繼續、以致對於一部尚存客氣、故成功之聲與不滿之聲、各得其半、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍大異動頃發內命如下、中華民國火使館附武官輔佐官影佐楨昭補陸軍省軍務局滿蒙班長、中國駐屯軍參謀大木良技補中華民國大使館附武官、輔佐官兵器本廠附眞方勳補參謀本部附中國勤務、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>十七日名古屋新聞載稱、陸軍以每年八月爲定期更動之期、十六日午後一時林陸相突然迫眞崎教育總監辭職、將來部內變化頗堪注目、按眞崎大將自滿洲事　後爲陸軍部內強硬派之巨頭、卽爲反宇垣派之代表、（眞崎前爲宇垣革職、怨憤不忘、）昭和六年以後、彼與前陸相荒木共同在陸軍部內、力圖消　宇垣系之勢力、此卽爲眞崎荒木閥之全盛時代、昭和八年、眞崎昇大將、任教育總監、荒木任陸相當時眞崎極力擴張勢力、部內各要職均爲其朋黨、致部內之統制、日益紛亂林在此情勢下、就任陸相、屢欲統制部內、故就任後、陸軍定期更動者達三四次、已露整理之意、然眞崎爲陸軍三大長官之一人、（三大長官、卽教育緹監·參謀總長·及陸軍大臣、共同掌握日本陸軍大權、）仍扶植自派勢力之強化、遂致眞崎系之行動處處與林陸相背馳、特對於在滿機構問題、議會五十萬元事伴、及天皇機關說問題、謠傳與外部連絡策動林陸相在部內受種種牽制、故林陸相不得不下决心乘本年八月更動之期、澈底肅正部內、乃於十二日三大長官會議、提出史動名單、果爲眞崎所反對、雙方意見衝突甚烈、是日會議、遂吿停頓、至十五日又開三長官會議、林陸相與眞崎教育總監之意見依然對立、但參謀總長閑院宮則贊同林陸相之意見、眞崎見勢已去、不得不提出辭職、當十二日三大長官會議之內容傳出後、眞崎派卽在各處會議、有示威行動、菱刈大將及荒木陸相曾訪問林陸相、奔走緩和、然林爲統制部內、堅持已見、十五日之三長官二次會議、遂發生正面衝突、眞崎憤然退席、林陸相卽徵詢荒木貞夫及宇垣系之阿部信行二大將對於繼任教育總監之意見、嗣乃决定色彩稍淡之渡邊錠太郎、一面將部內眞崎系巨頭、亦决定更動云、</p>
<p>又十八日名古屋新聞云、因八月定期異動問題、突然更迭教育總監眞崎大將、各方面引起絕大衝動、但自來對於林陸相之人事行政素抱疑問者今已一掃、而林陸相之進退亦爲各方所注目、原來林陸相者多目爲宇垣系之人、然陸相留任時、全然以無黨派色彩之立塲、處於單身孤立之地位、今林陸相以統制部內爲目標、竟得部內一部之支持、並以林陸相爲中心、結成中央派之勢力、更與以統制部內相標榜之統制派相聯合、積極進行中央部強化之工作、顧此問題與去年林陸相辭職問題大相關聯、此次更動上級長官、原欲將憲兵司令官秦眞次中將、調虎離山、轉補第二師團長、而以柳川平助中將任第一師團長、遞遺之缺由橋本虎之助繼任、庶幾對於統制上、可期強化、約言之、此次陸軍之更動、卽與皇道派之中心人物荒木眞崎兩大將、發生正面衝突、一方林陸相以橋本次官爲中心結成之中央派、頗得自來中立無色彩者之支持、故可目爲統制派、如第五師團長小磯國昭中將·第十師團長建川中將·軍務局長永田鐵山少將·關東軍副參謀長板垣少將·關東軍附橋本大佐等是、至工作之中心則由永田少將布置、而與此中央派對峙之皇道派（卽前幹部派）、如前陸相荒木貞夫·與眞崎大將爲中心之川島大將·秦中將·柳川中將·第十一師團長本莊中將·步兵第一聯隊長本間大佐等直系人物、以及眞崎大將系之岡村少將（參謀本部第二部長）·梅津中將（華北駐屯軍司令官）·重藤少將（步兵第十一旅團長）·持永少將（朝鮮憲兵司令官）·鈴木大佐（內閣調查官）·報本大佐（陸軍省新聞班長）·石原大佐（步兵第四聯隊長）等、錚錚有勢力者成對抗之勢、此次眞崎辭教育總監、卽皇道派凋落之表徵、亦卽中央派（卽統制派）抬頭之傾向、嚴格言之、卽宇垣派複活之表現、蓋渡邊大將（新任教育總監）·松井大將（軍事參議官）·杉山中將（參謀次長）·小磯中將及永田少將等、均爲宇垣系之同情者、然而自來目爲眞崎大將系之橋本大佐等與目爲秦系之建川中將及板垣少將等、亦轉向統制派、支持林陸相、扶助統一中央部強化者卽爲各派對立解消之表現、其中最堪注意者、卽現在陸軍之立塲、就華北問題可以窺知、蓋目下正值對華對俄工作之重大時期、部內陣容之強化刷新、實爲當前之急務耳、</p>
<p>又十八日東京朝日新聞云、自眞崎辭職、部內人心頓改、暗雲漂流、未許樂觀、卽同情於眞崎大將一部人士、以教育總監之更迭、爲前所未聞、故對於林之進退、亦生問題、且謂此次陸軍部內上級部之定期異動、完全爲私黨之感情措置、陸軍之統制、已暴露破壞、故爲國軍着想、不得不與林抗爭、此種空氣、已反映於首腦部與中堅階級、如欲打開此難局、全在新任教育總監之手腕如何、以定事態之推移、不過林陸相去年因其弟白上佑問題、自知不安於位、曾提出辭職、此次更動長官、眞崎派難免舊事重提、以爲倒林之口實云、</p>
<h3>日陸軍决定　强化航空部</h3>
<p>（東京）陸軍省爲強化其航空部計、决定改善陸軍航空部、令在航空部內設立航空工廠、在所澤連設飛行學校、此案業於十九日閣議正式决定、但遲兩日公布內容、（二十三日聯電）</p>
<h3>朝鮮大水</h3>
<p>京城　朝鮮地方自二十日晚下大雨、至二十三日正午未北、漢江漲水、深達三十餘尺、沿岸各戶仍有浸水、京城仁川京內有水害、京城新義州間電話杜絕、（二十三日日聯電）</p>
<h3>外蒙當局　拒絕日本要求　謂爲侵犯主權及獨立</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）據庫倫來訊、傀儡政府要求外蒙接受彼等要求、卽准許傀儡政府及關東軍總部遣派代表常駐外蒙境內、並允彼等在外蒙境內自建電報綫以與滿洲聯絡交通、此等要求侵犯外蒙之主權及獨立、業經蒙方於七月三日加以拒絕、七月十七日滿洲外部代表日人又向滿洲里之蒙古代表團主席桑布遞一書面聲明、申述傀儡政府提議、外蒙應與傀儡政府交換常設及有權力之代表、以代過去片面辦法、其後庫倫方面接得滿洲里關東軍代表署名於七月十日發出之信件、重申其六月二十三日逮捕日本地形考察者乃在滿洲里境內之謊言、並提出傀儡政府之三項要求、則我方當局認爲全部蒙古軍隊之退出塔西克布拉克及東部邊境、殊爲重要、此等要求乃爲解决問題之最低限度、日本軍隊將採斷然行動」云、外蒙方面指出該項信件又已暴露駐滿日本軍閥之計劃、乃在引起衝突、並在任何條件之下、努力利用彼等自己引起之衝突、作爲攫取蒙古領土之藉口、（二十三日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>英海相宣布　放棄比率制度　日本方面已起應聲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國海軍大臣孟珊爾今日於下院中聲稱、限制海軍之國際制度或海軍比例主義、雖曾防止戰爭於已往、然時至今日、實已不能不認爲失敗而予放棄、勞合喬治今日亦於下院中批評英德海軍協定、稱此約已許德國作潛艇戰爭、更許德國增添此種武器云、（廿二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院開會時、各黨發言老均痛詆英德海軍協定、工黨議員賀爾謂政府先責德國弁髦凡爾賽和約中之軍備條文、旋忽與德國締結增加其海軍力之協定、實屬自相矛盾云、自由黨議員海軍中將康貝爾謂該恊定使德國有嶄新的海軍、而英國之軍艦多將漸趨陳舊云、勞合喬治謂政府對於德國所有潛艇之數、不特加以寬容、且反許之增造多艘、此種「輕心」、至堪扼腕云、海相孟塞爾答稱、主要海軍國之比率、行將廢棄、因數國以爲接受教遜之實力、實有損其國威也、英政府現行動之原則、爲申請各國開報其一九四二年所願有之海軍、海相繼闢英國片面行動之責言、謂多面主義已使德國陸軍要求由三十萬人增至五十五萬人矣、其空軍實力亦然、故吾人對於其海軍、未可容其亦然、（閣員席歡呼聲大起）廢除潛艇、爲英國海軍政策首先所注重之事、英國歡迎德國之合作、並希望在軍備大會中有成功之更佳機會云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國海相蒙塞爾氏發表廢除比率主義之宣言、日本外務當局對於此事表明見解如下、英國政府認明比率主義不應作爲軍縮方式之理由、實係諒解日方之合理主張、英國旣已諒解、則美國當亦不至強硬固執於比率主義、廢除比率主義後之軍縮方式、究竟是否採用自主之造艦宣言、尚屬問題、恐非充分考慮不爲功也云云、（二十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）英海相孟賽爾二十二日在下院宣言放棄海軍比率主義、頗惹起各方面注目、日海軍部對此問題意見、大致如下、英國以英德會談爲基礎、漸次解决根本海軍問題、英國雖拋棄比率主義、然其具體案如缺乏實質、則日本不能同意、（二十三日日聯電）</p>
<h3>全英領空飛行　由樸資茅至新加坡</h3>
<p>樸資茅　今晨英皇家空軍飛艇一架、在白蘭德利滋隊長指導之下、由此起程飛往新加坡、作第一次經過全英領空之飛行、將道出直布羅陀馬爾太巴薩爾克希瑪喀拉基等地而至新加坡、擬以十九日飛抵目的地、艇中載有司機員一、及其他人員四、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍用浩繁需欵孔亟　意政府廢金本位　國家銀行放棄四成準備　對阿備戰中之第一打擊</h3>
<p>（羅馬）政府公報今日發表命令、解除意大利國家銀行對於所發紙幣必須有現金準備百分之四十之責任、惟此舉並非卽爲意國業已放棄金本位云、該項命令頒佈之後、卽刻生效、其措詞如下、「政府因亟於設法向國外支付特種欵項、故已將一九一七年十二月二十一日諭旨中第四項之第一節、命令意大利國家對於其所發行之紙幣、務須隨時準備現金至少百分之四十之規定、暫時廢止、按上述聖諭於一九二八年六月七日成爲法律、（廿二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意政府今日宣布取消國家鈔票黃金準備百分四十之條文、極爲人所重視、蓋與意政府以前維持意幣價格之政策完全相反也、意政府此舉似以意阿時局極端嚴重、蓋欲不問代價如何進行到底也、惟意國至此已廢除金本位矣、自一九二七年起、意財部努力撑持、保全金準備百分四十之法律、但此僅對內而言、若對外則貨幣之輸出、統制甚嚴、至實際上早已放棄金本位、昨夜交易所收市後、政務會又祕密開會、而有廢除金準備法律之决定、此乃意國對阿備戰後財政上所受之第一打擊、蓋意國旣在海外積極採辦戰具、國庫存金乃源源流出也、意國近曾擬至海外籌集私人債欵、但未有效、茲見匯欵待解者甚多、故停止鈔票準備金、俾可得九千三百萬鎊、以便匯付外欵、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）財政觀察者今日以爲意國減低紙幣之現金準備實爲通貨膨脹之先聲、此種膨脹將難於控制、有如德國以前之情形、目前意國雖尚未能與戰後之德國相比擬、惟財政事家預料意國因遠征東非、所費不貲、其財政將每現愈下云、（廿二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意大利暫時停止金本位一舉、此間並不引以爲奇、蓋證券交易所方面早已預料及此、據金融界觀察、意大利此種行動之原因有二、（一）意大利無欵支付軍需、（二）無法獲得國外之借欵、據每日電聞載稱、意大利近以購買大批美國貨車、對方堅持付清現欵、故祗得以銀條償付、此間預料意幣此後勢將狂跌、而游意旅費則將隨之昂貴、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政府解釋暫時停北金準備之法律、謂並非抑低幣價、意政府擬儘速恢復金準備、外國放欵社管理部及商業匯兌局擬用比率之制度、使政府於意幣受攻擊時立卽設法維護之、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法意見一致　國聯下星期中開會　援引盟約第十五條</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法政府對於國聯行政院在下星期中集議一事、已獲同意、其確期將由俄外委李維諾夫定之、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）聞英法已商得同意、國聯行政院開會考應意阿爭議時、應援國聯盟約第十五條處理之、駐巴黎英大使今日復與法總理兼外長賴伐爾會商意阿爭議事、官塲現不願輕托發言、故對於兩員之會談、不作評論、衆信英法政府現皆殫精竭慮覔取消弭意阿戰爭之方法、國聯秘書長愛文諾已於今日抵此、衆視此行甚關重要、謠傳蘇俄外委李維諾夫或將來此參加討論、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日傍晚七時英國大使克萊克爵士晉謁賴伐爾總理兼外長商談阿比西尼亞問題、蓋英國內閣今晨已爲此事舉行會議、散會後、曾有訓令寄交克萊克爵士、令與賴伐爾晤談也、一般人相信法國贊成國聯會行政院於下月初開會、屆時行政院不僅指派中立國第五仲裁員、且或將根據盟約第十五條、而將意阿爭端、通盤加以研究云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院七月二十五日開會之期將屆、與國聯有關之各界對於意阿爭議將來之趨勢、現紛起猜測、衆信英國之態度將决定國聯之方針、蘇俄外委李維諾夫刻在意國、日內將晤意相墨索里尼、必與討論國聯所將取之手續問題、阿比西尼亞政府所請援引國聯盟約第十五條實施之行動、迄今覺有緩施之可能、但阿國之請願終不能長此置之不理也、按國聯盟約第十五條之要點爲行政院應盡力調解兩國間之爭議、如不能解决、則行政院經全體或多數之表决、應繕發報吿書、說明爭議之事實及行政院所認爲公允適當之建議、如行政院之報吿書經會員一致贊成、則互爭之兩造之一、不得向遵從報吿書建議之任何一造從事戰爭、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）法國對於意阿爭議將與英國同一步趨之希望漸見有力、蓋意阿萬一不能商妥調解辦法、則國聯行政院集議時如任令東菲發生戰禍、則法國將見歐洲條約之算嚴淪於危險之中、此英閣員所深信者、同時英國之態度現結晶而成一種見解、卽集體行動之各種機會如全消失、英國在日內瓦必須挺身對付廣大之事件、而拒絕行政院之討論僅以華爾華爾爭案爲限、並公然聲明、如他國願照英國所為、則英國準備履行國聯盟約下之義務是、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣今日舉行特別會議、討論意阿爭議、現信內閣已决議不禁止軍火運往意國或阿國、因其他政府現無一取管理運往此二國軍火之步驟也、惟關於意阿爭議之軍火請發護照出口者、迄今均留擱以待考慮、外相霍爾日內將在下院對該問題有所宣布（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下院各黨議員若干人今晚在某處聚宴、此宴目的、在使阿比西尼亞公使馬丁官述阿國對意阿爭議之立場、先日主席工黨議員達維士宣稱、此番國聯大約將受最後一次之試騐矣、繼由馬丁詳述阿比西尼亞近年來之進步、而對於主張公道、趨向廢奴、尤爲着力、爭議之根本原因、乃在意國欲圖吞阿、而陽稱使阿得文明化云、埃及前任駐英公使摩哈蘭起對阿國表示同情、並謝英國弭戰之努力、前曾任埃及國會議長之李法特亦依此旨向衆致詞、馬丁後接見路透訪員時、謂渠曾與私人方面接洽、擬在英國或美國募債英金二百萬鎊、以供阿國發展之用、渠近接投效爲阿從戰之函數百通、且有數人、不願獲酬、投函者頗多愛爾蘭人、此誠奇事云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣今日舉行特別會議後、據可靠消息、政府甚恐意相墨索里尼之殖民野心將擴展至阿比西尼亞以外、而致與英國在非洲之利益發生直接衝突、因此霍爾外相力促其同僚設法、使國聯以意阿爭端或爲地方化、國聯事務大臣艾登不以霍爾之建議爲善、稱國聯如擬作此等舉動、則其戚信將完全傾覆云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>美决維持使館　不問阿比西尼亞有何發展</h3>

<h3>英義警告教士　集中阿京近郊</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英政府今日已勢吿各教會當局、宜勸吿駐於阿國境內之英籍教士必須集中於阿京附近、聞駐於阿境之英教士、連同眷屬在內、共約百餘人、阿境內最大之教會爲蘇丹內地教會、其職員多爲美人與加拿大人、另聖經會有教士十五人、教堂教會有教士二人駐於阿境、此外尚有猶太教會七所、其教士多爲瑞士人或德人、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間觀察者之意見、如和平交涉之根本工作不能開始、則意阿戰爭在本星期秒將難於避免云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>意增防日使館　各地發生排日運動</h3>
<p>羅馬　據此間各報載稱、米蘭·熱諾亞、波洛箬今日均有排日之示威運動、演說者皆痛詆日本之對阿態度、郵報今日載有社論、評詆日本之虛偽無信、首鼠兩端、並作問語曰、日本何以不能不問阿事乎、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間當局已在日本大使館前增加守衛、以防北示威運動、蓋以日本表示對阿立塲之後、各報社論一致抨擊日本、難免不發生民衆之反日示威運動也、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）日本外務省否認其駐意大使杉村有權可向意國保證日本對於意阿爭端採取不干涉政策之後、今日意報均向日本作猛烈之攻擊、意大利民報稱、從此意國政府儘可不信日本使節之任何聲明、並謂日本之脫離國聯、無非欲於侵略中國之時、可得自由行動而已、該報亦指摘日本意欲在菲洲實行經濟侵略、並擬締結軍事同盟、甚至以爲英國及國聯力能阻止意國在菲之計劃、故目前意國除受阿國之威嚇以外、尚遭遇日本極大之擴張計劃云、新聞報社論亦稱、日本擬增進其在菲極微之地位、而欲促進其商務上及政治上之勢力、殊不知菲洲鄰折意國、日本欲擴展至意國之範圍以內、恐猶非其時云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間半官方面宣稱、日本大使松村向論壇報記者所稱、彼仍堅持最近與墨索里尼談話中之各點、彼以大使之資格保證其談話完全與日政府之意見脗合、卽日本對於阿比西尼亞並無利害觀念是也、日大使繼稱、日本對於阿國當然有商業上之利益、但無政治上之興趣、關於此項商業上之利益、則日本擬在今年十二月底於阿京設立使館云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官式之「意大利日報」登載評論、內稱「日本一方面侵入亞洲大陸及印度以危及英國之主要利益、另一方面則通過紅海以入菲洲大陸、謀大舉向歐洲國家取經濟之攻勢、日本此種野心、英國當知之甚審、由是則意大利之東菲政策、不僅在應付阿比西尼亞之威脅、且亦在於防止日本之侵略野心、今欲求歐洲國家之相互聯繫、則在菲洲首先有密切聯繫之必要、其理固益明矣」云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相曾於本月十六日向駐日意國大使奧里梯關於意阿糾紛闡明日本政府之所信、但意大利方面仍以杉村駐意大使之說明與政府之方針發生齟齬、乃宣傳反日、甚且報道盛行中傷日本、一方面渴望日本之阿富　伊關等處之駐使陸續請實佈日本今後之方針、是　廣田外相於二十三日向駐外使爲發出訓令、傳達日本方面所持之明確方針、以便將誤會爲之一掃、並關於意阿糾紛囑其注意、勿爲他國所利用、是所　盼云云、（二十二日日聯電</p>

<h3>倫敦注意　金集團之恐慌　荷幣制將引起政潮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）金集團之恐慌現復引起倫敦人士之注意、但注意所集中點、非意幣而爲荷幣、蓋意國之固守金本位、久爲理想超過事實之舉、故意政府宣布減少金準備、並無多大影響、今日倫敦列爾掛牌價爲六三·七五、昨日爲六〇·一二、巴黎對羅馬之匯價爲每百列爾、等於一一八·〇〇佛郎、昨價爲一二四·七五佛郎、倫敦對於意國財政、久抱悲觀、自阿比西尼亞爭案發展後、益爲惶恐、今日荷蘭國會將表决經濟議案、市縐甚汴意表决之結果、蓋如予否决、則將引起政治風潮也、該議案之命運、繫於羅馬天主教黨之行動、如政府被敗、則衆將對荷盾作新攻擊、此月前荷盾現貨與遠期價格均見軟弱之原因也、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國債之內幕　約六十萬萬馬克爲官方所未發表</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國民智週報今日登載專文、揭示官方統計中並未列入之國價、約有六十萬萬馬克之多、一般人以爲此文出於經濟部長兼德國國家銀行總裁沙赫德之授意、故外人已予以深切之注意、該文聲稱、由本年三月底至六月底之三個月間、國債驟增十一萬萬馬克之鉅、故請政府趕速厲行減政計劃、又謂德國今日之短期國債、實際上有八十萬萬馬克、故國債總數、實有一百八十萬萬馬克之鉅、歷來政府公告認爲僅有一百二十四萬萬馬克者、乃官樣文章耳、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>拖救失敗　明興擱淺、地在陽邏右岸、當時船體爲淺灘泥吸住、致無法行動、船主即在船之四周汕量水尺、船首處打見五尺水、船尾打見八尺水、即由該輸船主電漢分局求救、先因招商局汪裕輸、差用在漢、囚拖江大、而乞其代曳、江裕先徇明興船主要求、代爲拖曳、絕無效力、嗣三北漢分局派醒獅輪到來拖救、當以鋼絲纜兩條繫住後、開足馬力拖救、至鋼絲纜折斷、明興船身、未能移動分毫、</p>
<p>船體斜側　滬公司得船主電吿、明興輪拖救已失望、且現當江水退洛之際、擱淺處、係在江邊之上陸地內、萬一退水前不設法救出、則非當危險、今該輪船體、已漸見傾斜、尤覺岌岌可危、昨午滬公司已經議定、决將船內貨物、完全起卸出淸、至必要時、船身上部、亦不惜拆卸、俾僅留船壳、則四尺吃水亦可浮出、已將此意電漢照辦、</p>
<p>駁卸貨物　該輪以大號駁船、一時難覓、先詢太古怡和、未能成功、昨午得漢分局電吿、經向日淸公司租到大駁船、即日開至陽邏、並由漢派工人一批、前往卸駁船內貨煤、侯出淸時、再行推救、務在短時間內曳出云、</p>
<p>船體狀況　明興輪爲三北公司新買自怡和者、船價十九萬元、再加大修、及增建台甲航位後、傾爲該公司長江輸中第一艘俊秀船、總噸爲二千七百七十噸、船身二百七十八英尺又一寸、闊四十二尺九寸、滿船吃水爲十二尺、現三北公司以全力進行抱救、蓋大水一落、則此船便離拖救脫淺也、</p>

<h3>我國體育　今後應有之改進</h3>
<p>— 劉昌合</p>
<p>劉君昌合、畢業於南京中央大學體育科、學術兼優、曾任武漢大學體育副主任、成績卓著、劉鑒於吾國體育、近年以來、提倡甚力、但深恐入於畸形發展之途、乃赴美入春田大學、專攻體育行政、及目下國內所缺乏之師資學程、同時並實地考察美國各部實施體育之情形、劉君巳於日前學成歸國、是篇係劉君歸國後對於吾國體育今後改進之初步意見、所論別具慧識、足爲吾國體育界之重要參考、體育教育、關係國民生活、社會生存者甚大、故體育界同人所担負之事業實有延續民族生命之使命、現任既如此之重大、故對於體育之改進與研究、應如何努力、以薪適合於國情、然欲求適合國情、必先確定其目標、增進其效果、同時又須適應世界之潮流、社會之需要、顧及國家之財政、乃可以挽救黨國之危亡於萬一、昌合年來在美考察、觀感極多、謹以研究所得、略舉數端、以供國人及體育界同仁之參考、</p>
<p>節省無益廢費　從事實際建設</p>
<p>連年天災滸、匪共騷擾、強鄰壓境、國困民貧、當此之時、救民衛國、需欵孔殷、故於國家各項費用、總宜以節省爲主、發展體育事業、亦復如此、我國體育、過重形式、故無益之耗費甚多、每一運動會之舉行、動輒糜費數萬金少亦數千金、若設法節省、以之建築堅固適用之運動塲、其裨益人民與體育事業前途、何等重大、故愚謂今後各類運動會、應從根本上發揚人民運動之精神、關於形式上一切、應以簡單節省爲原則、至於選手之派遣、亦應嚴格限制、世界、遠東、全國、及各區種種運動全、除挑選具有特殊之運動成績選手外、決不可抱使多出席參觀之主張、因其流弊不特耗費多鱗、並妨碍運動員個人前途之發展、因一般運動員、參加較大規模之運動會後、驕心必生、又因其成績太差、練習時又唯恐後進比較、結果因以失比較磨練之機會、故一般運動員、自出席大會後、運動塲中不見其踪跡者、比比皆是、</p>
<p>鼓勵民衆捐助　減輕政府負担</p>
<p>鼓勵人民團體捐助、減輕政府負担、政令財政困難、目前巳達於極點、社會事業之發展、至鉅且繁、勢必有所不能、而社會體育之提倡、又有急不容緩、若候政府有餘力而後舉辦、必至徒耗時日、永無發展之望、政府當局、及體育行政人員、亦應積極鼓勵各省、市、縣、鄉之個人捐贈、或集資購置運動塲所、使政府不費一文之力、而使各省、市、縣、鄉各體育塲之健築、得以複舊同、以爲普及民衆運動之基礎、</p>
<p>注意兒童體育　藉作普及新步</p>
<p>兒童教育之實施、不壓其早、兒童體育之訓導亦然、兒童天性愛動、應設法增減其興趣、使之增進基好動之良好習慣、故小學及初中時期體育之實施、極爲重要、我國因數千年重文輕武之惡習、一班父兄、對其子弟之好動者、則稱曰「頑皮」、而認爲不良子弟、故一班兒童、對其天生之好動習慣、不特不能使之增長、反因而消退、此我國體育上最大之妨碍、有糾正必要者、今後欲復興民族、必先造成健全之國民、而欲造成健全之國民、必須增減兒童運動之習慣、他日昇入各級學校或服務社會、其愛動習慣尚可繼續維持、身體健康因以增進、普及之功易達、民族乃可強盛矣、</p>
<p>訓練注重方法　練習責在有恒</p>
<p>運動方法甚多、姿勢亦屬殊易、選擇之方、須根據力學原則、及專家經驗、訓練時、應將各段運動　用之力學之法、詳細解釋及證明、使學者得以明瞭、方可增其信仰、欲求成績之增進、非一朝一夕之功、必具刻苦耐勞、有所不同之精神、永恒不懈、乃可臻效、我國運動員、多患臨時抱佛腳之病、故成績難能進步、加之練習運動、一飽十饑、過猶不及、身體最易愛傷、學業亦因以荒廢、不特無益、而又害之。故今後提倡體育、必須矯正過去之方法、以收平時訓練之功效也、</p>
<p>教材根據實用　目標適應國情</p>
<p>運動教材與目標、關係體育之價值極大、故其選擇、須根據國情、乃可以適應國民性之需要、並須注意年齡而實施、如兒童體育、應訓練之以包含愛國思想、及活潑遊戲之教材、道德、紀律、服從、互助、合作、國體、等、俱爲訓練兒童美德之基礎、訓練中學及大學體育、除桓增減以上教材外、應實施以運動量較大、包含勇敢、耐勞、避險及其他實用之教材、至於社會鄉村體育、更應顧及經濟之情形、適合特殊之需要、並予以相當之組織、使爲接受軍事訓練之基礎、更家灌輸以運輸、救護等常識、爲他日軍國民之準備、</p>
<p>集中專門人材　擴大師資學校</p>
<p>我國體育、日趨於普及爲勢所必然、故各級學校體育師資、及社會鄉村體育服務人員等、需要數量更大、而高等優育師資又極缺乏、最好集中專門人材、（哪國立體育學院名稱）擴大師資學校組織、訓練全國體育師資於一堂、能如是、不特經費可以節省、成績可以增進、且可打破派界限、一統步伐、作同方向之推進、合作既易、自能收事半功倍之效、此特爲高等體育師資過度朝代、唯一挽救辦法而巳也、其內容組織、略述如下、</p>
<p>（一）童子軍組　可分初中高中二種程度爲訓練小學及初中社會教練員師資、</p>
<p>（二）國術組　可分初中高蹺及大學三種程度、爲訓練小學高實中社會及大學教師、</p>
<p>（三）軍警體育組　可分高中及大學二種程度、爲訓練軍隊警警及軍警學校師資、</p>
<p>（四）普及體育組</p>
<p>A初中部　爲應目前鄉村體育師資之需要及顧及鄉村經濟情形、故其程度可低修業年限減短、則使其將來可以接受較低之促進鄉村之體育、</p>
<p>B中級部　高中及師範資格培養初中小學教員及社會體育指導員、</p>
<p>C高級部　訓練高中教員社會體育行政人員及大學助教大學專科程度、</p>
<p>（五）研究組　備爲童子軍國術軍警體育普通體育諸組、合大學專科之畢業學生進行高深之專門研究者、以養成各科專家及體育行政人員、</p>

<p>東坡詩曰：『不識廬山眞面目，只緣身在此山中。』二語殊富哲理，耐人尋味。嗜好鴉片者，自以為一榻橫陳，吞雲吐霧，有無限情趣。但在旁人看來，只見屍牀之上，斜放着一具骷髏耳。「責人則明，責己則暗。」古今人之所同，查其因，亦由於看人易明，看己不易，亦如身在廬山，而不見廬山眞面目，同是一般道理。</p>

<h3>分食問題的商榷</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的炎熱起來，人們對于衛生問題，應當格外注意！本市每届夏季，總舉行衛生運動，也便是勸導民眾對于生活一切，都要注重清潔與衛生，不過；在下以為「食」的問題更關重要，因為前人有「病從口入」的箴言，所以在這暑天，有很多的人，是抱素食主義的，但「分食」問題，在下以為也有討論的價值，因為我國人每餐聚食，抬上設置了幾碗菜肴，大家舉箸向菜碗內亂攪，而向各人的口內送去，由此循環往返，菜碗內早佈滿各人的涎沫，設或同桌的人，內有患瘡毒者，便容易由箸上傳染開來了。而且這個問題，在去夏也曾有人提議過，其時有主張用兩箸挾菜的，也有倡用每人分碗盛置菜肴的，可是國人習慣旣深，一時很不易移改！而反對駁斥的理由，却說若用两箸互換挾菜，旣嫌麻煩，而每個人若將菜肴用碗分盛，那每人的碗，更非數雙不辦，如全桌以八人計，行見抬面碗碟大會操，殊失雅觀了！現在在下思得一策，旣合衛生，復不碍觀瞻，便是每大備菜，飯，碗各一具，惟菜碗須略大，中分數格，如畫師之色碟，以分置肴饌，豈不甚妙！陋見如此，是否可行，全在大家提倡了。</p>

<p>三四月間，走進六安麻埠山裏，第一使你感覺到十二分暢適的：就是各種巧妙的鳥聲，唱出種種不同的調子，內中有一種「楊貴祿」，它的聲音哀切而宛轉，有點像黃鸝，成天到晚，一聲聲地「楊貴祿」「楊貴祿」沒一刻兒休息，尤其是在毛毛雨的天氣，或者是朦朧的月夜，它的啼聲，格外悽切，你如果是遠離鄕井，而單身到麻埠來遊覽茶山風景的旅客，恁你有十二分歡樂的情緒，也會被她叫得悵惘，凄凉，而感覺空虛與寂寞；使你生懷鄕病。這種鳥聲，是別的地方所沒有的。</p>
<p>關於「楊貴祿」的故事，相傳是這樣的：楊貴祿，是山東人，他和他的妻子結婚不久，因為羨慕麻埠茶春季的繁華，就拋撇了他的嬌妻，到麻埠遊覽，麻埠茶春季的繁華，是素來有名的。滿山採茶的大姑娘唱着曼妙冶蕩的採茶歌，翠袖紅裳，和嫩綠茶樹，五顏六色的山躑躅花，掩映交輝，在大自然氤氳的天氣裏，是多末使人沉醉啊！楊貴祿沉溺共間，不到兩個月，就病死了，他的愛妻，因為他久無音信，不遠千里來到麻埠尋夫，等到伊到達麻埠的時候，楊貴祿已經死了，伊對着一坯黃土，整天價哀號，化成一隻鳥，依然整天整夜的悲啼，一直到現在，一到茶春季，就有伊的悽惋的聲調了。</p>

<h3>戲談魔術</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>上海社會，好像一座魔術團的大本營？一般魔術高明的演員，他們思想靈敏，手段高妙，一會兒兩隻空手裏能變出許多花花綠綠的鈔票，一會兒能變出高大洋房，新式汽車，摩登美人，要變那樣，就是那樣，任憑你要什麼東西？都可得心應手，隨心所欲，易如反掌，眞是移花接木，變化無窮！</p>
<p>還有一種催眠的法術，也非常奧妙。要你睡覺，就可使你立時夢遊黑甜之鄕。要你走，就是走。要你坐，就是坐。一個魂靈兒，無有不受他的指揮，不聽他的命令。這種催眠術，比較魔術，有異曲同工的妙處！</p>
<p>那些魔術功夫幼稚的演員，則變出來的東西，不大高明。且倐來倏去，如過眼雲烟，如曇花一現，使人看了，竟要頭暈目眩，有時偶一不愼，竟被看客識穿破綻，台下的看官們，豈不是要大喝其倒彩了嗎？</p>
<p>尚有一般新進魔術團的練習生，他們只能做些半眞半假的滑稽戲劇，戴上假面具，身穿奇異的服裝，手拿一根司的克，你詈我駡，你騙我　，你打我踢，神通廣大，手法敏捷，這種角兒，雖然只會做那鬼鬼祟祟的勾當，但是魔術大家，不能不借重這幾位手下的助手！</p>
<p>不過魔術也要有魔術的天資，如果沒有魔術天資的人們，強要學習魔術的話，那末勢必至於弄出許多笑話，說不定：有人當他患着神經病呢！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隱蹄痕難逃冷　衣冠誇幸運會到權門</p>
<p>廳長留下一句話，約我三點鐘再去。他見了面，說上許多對不住，我又怎能怪他？所以今天只是忙了伺候兩位廳長，沒有理會到和你寫信的這一件事。浣花　道那麼，恭喜你，快要有差事了。介夫笑道：我也恭喜你，你現在可以回江南了。靠着我這封信，多錢不說，由南京到上海的一點小火車費，我那朋友總可以送你的。到我屋子去，我這就和你寫信。說着，伸了一隻手，到浣花身後去，作個要扶他的樣子。浣花道：寫信呢，那不忙，還是賈先生許了給我的用資，現在還沒有拿出來，我想請求請求張先生去催一聲。晚上我再到張先生房間裏來　行。介夫瞅着他笑道：你準能來嗎？浣花道：那我怎敢騙你？介夫哈哈發笑，　是走了。浣花向志前點個頭，並不進來，也自走了。不到兩分鐘的時候，却聽到隔壁屋子、拍的一聲，拍了桌子響，李士廉接着罵起來道：這個年月　只要不要臉就有飯吃。為了求人家一封八行，代馬拉皮條的事，全都做了。賈多才也太不念交情，太不長眼睛，這樣的人，給他　寫介紹信。說着，又聽到重重的放下茶杯子。志前出呆出了神，就不知不覺的笑了。　士廉隔了壁道：程先生，你聽到張介夫那一番吹的工夫嗎？開口廳長，閉口廳長，我眞替他肉麻。（二七三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>至於第三條，現在的情形又和以前不同了！如今是無論官吏或平民，都可以很隨便的娶姨太太；（譯者按之在新刑法規定後的情形又不同了，凡娶妾的都得入獄）。在從前，雖說做官的人比如今格外的勇於娶妾，但有個限制，如果所娶的全是打奴婢中挑選出來的，或是打小戶人家以及娼寮中收買來的，那就不論你娶多少，誰也無從指摘，所禁的祗是強迫良家婦女為妾。</p>
<p>當太后在逐一檢閱慶親王所携來來全案的文卷時，我便在背後默默的回想：記得當太后指定了幾位大員，遄赴廣東去查辦這件控案的時候，我父親的精神上是怎樣的痛苦；因為他老人家恰巧也被派為查辦大員之一，更不幸的是他和這位被控的撫台老爺素極友善，可算得是一位密友。當然，我父親對於他所被控的種種罪狀是毫無關係的，旣未和他通同作弊，也不會為他故意掩飾；但他知道了他的好友給人家以如許重大的罪狀來控訴之後，心上自不免十分難過。幸而事情還不會尷尬到極點；我父親雖不能公然抗拒太后的懿旨，躱在家內，不去查辦，却猶喜太后並不會指派他為領袖的查辦員，只教他當一名普通的陪員，這樣事情就好辦多了！不料到廣東去走了一遭回來，竟越發的使他感到煩惱了；因為事實已很清楚地查明了，據他在家裏私下告訴我們說，所有控告那撫台的條欵已完全證明是不假的了，甚至還有許多未曾列入罪狀內的劣跡，也一起發現了。所以我父親眞是非常的為他愁慮。（三七三）</p>
<h3>西瓜之種類</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>光陰迅速，不覺又是六月炎夏了，火一般的太陽，撐矖天空，西瓜便又應時而生，成了却暑解渴的妙品。西瓜的產地極多，種類也小一，大江南北，都有極好的西瓜出產，在江南的一帶，最著名的，要算是以下的幾種。</p>
<p>常熟出產的西瓜，有一種雪鈎瓜，皮的顏色是花翠條子，囊是白色，瓜子却是赭紅色的，如玉一般的白瓤，儭上了赭紅色的瓜子，越發的鮮艷奪目，甜汁又多，如蜜一般的鮮潔，可稱是西瓜中的上品，但是每年出產的很少，除了常熟本地人外，絕少嚐到這種美味。</p>
<p>青浦練塘，出產一種三白瓜，瓜瓤也是白玉色的，瓜子却是蝴蝶子，是白子上有兩點黑點，所以稱為三白的緣故，因了皮白，瓤白，子白，共有三白，甜味也鮮潔異常，不亞於常熟雪鈎。</p>
<p>這一處所出的西瓜，都門的有專名稱，凡是歡喜西瓜的人，大　沒一個不知道的，其餘崇明，有一種火黃瓤的黑皮西瓜，也十分甜潔，蘇州各鄕，有白瓤和黃瓤的西瓜出產，滋味却不如常熟和練塘了。</p>
<p>提起了德州西瓜，恐怕沒一個不知道是山東德州的出產，是一種枕形式的西瓜，每個約有十餘斤的重量，　的顏色，是黃，紅兩種，滋味比了江南所出產的西瓜，還得勝上幾分，怕除了哈密瓜之外，沒一處勝過他的，所以名聞全國，在山東出產的水菓之中，佔了重要的地位。</p>
<p>我國本部之有西瓜，都是從哈密傳來的。哈密所產生的西瓜，據嚐過的人稱為全國第一，作者却沒有嚐過，不敢妄自猜測，只因現在的新疆哈密，交通比了從前，已便了許多，政府要人，去的人很多，　此嚐得哈密瓜為異味，瓜的滋味，自然是好的了。</p>
<p>西瓜因為產地的不同，他的份量，皮色，瓤色，便也各不相同。大都最大的西瓜，有二三十斤，最小的四五斤，再小便不能吃了。瓜皮的顏色，有深青花，淡青花，黑皮，白皮，野雞皮等幾種。瓜瓤的顏色，最多的是紅，火黃，白三種，其餘尚有粉紅，淡黃，桃紅等幾種，但是紅，黃，白三種，是西瓜本有的顏色，淡黃，粉紅等色，便是變種了。瓜子也有蝴蝶子，是白色頭上生着兩點紅點或是黑點，檀香子，是赭紅色，黑子等三種，大約白瓤的西瓜，都是蝴蝶子，只有常熟的是例外，火黃和紅色瓤的便是檀香子和黑子。</p>
<p>在老於西瓜種類的人，一見了瓜皮的顏色，就可以知道瓜瓤的色澤，差不多淡花皮的都是白瓤，深花皮同黑皮，便是火黃和紅色，白皮也以白瓤為多，野雞皮却有紅白兩種，但是常熟雪鈎，却是深青花皮而白瓤，所以也不能一別瓜瓤的經驗，這也須有西瓜種類經驗的人，方始有這個辨別力啊！</p>

<h3>淸末的商人小說</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>大概是由於智識階級和商人不大接近，而「商」又被派作四民之末，歷來寫商人的小說，是很少見的。在近人所著的長篇中，我們只有一部茅盾的「子夜」，在淸末也祇有一部姬文的「市聲」。雖淸末也有「商界現形記」類的著作，但實際是無足稱的。那些也寫商人，而實際只是要寫妓院生活的吳語小說，是更沒有把它作爲商人小說看的道理。</p>
<p>在開始讀「市聲」的時候，我抱着很大的希望，因爲此書一開塲，就寫有一位百萬的財主，要用他全部的經濟，從事於振興中國工業，以抵抗外貨，而很多人物的談話，也都在這一點上着眠。我好像很有把握似的，從這部畫裏可以看到開始激急化的中外商戰的面影　雖也肯定結果必然是失敗。</p>
<p>姬文果眞是把握住這一主綫，始終不脫這一中心寫下去，那麽「市聲」真將成爲一部了不起的書，是特出的文學作品，也是更有力量的很珍貴的社會史料了。却再也想不到剛接觸到這一方面，馬上就滑溜了過去，發展到別一件事的描寫。後來固然還斷續的寫這一個人物，但所寫竟是另一方面，一些壞的部下怎樣的在各方而中飽，使他陷於失敗，根本上就沒有說到「戰」。</p>
<p>作者的目的，不過是想暴露當時的一班商人，在「振興工商」的美名下，做了些怎樣混賬的事，使自己暴發起來，而又失敗下去。寫作的方法，頗近於其他的　責小說，「其記事遂率與一人俱起，亦即與其人俱訖，一只大富豪的一錢，若斷若續，時有時無。主要的是寫繭商，茶商，絲商，地皮掮客，以及想從事工商業的富兒，大滑頭。</p>
<p>所以在「市聲」幾能以看到的，除這一些並非「眞商」的人物的活動外，祇有很少幾件有關當時商情的概念，中國商業在外國資本下的失收過程。自然也能以看到上海繁榮的趨向，但那也是不多。</p>
<p>如寫外絲的操縱絲業市塲：一外國絲一年多似一年，中國商家還有什麽指望呢？他們一個行情做出來，不怕你們不依。我是看透了其中毛病，恐怕只有落下去」（　繭掮客吳月坡的話，是卷上四六面。）如寫茶業：「如今中國茶業，日見消乏，推原其故，是印度錫蘭產的茶多了。他們是有公司的，一切種茶採茶之事，都是公司裏派人監視着。況且他那茶，是用機器所製，外國人喜吃這種，只覺中國茶沒味。我記得十數年前，中國茶出口，多至一百八十八萬九千多担，後來只「百二十幾萬担了。逐漸減少，茶商還有什麽生色呢？」（想振興茶業的歐　山語，面五十。）只有這些地方還能約略窺見些逐漸衰落下來的情形。</p>
<p>「實行工商戰」許多有志者是如此想，而且奔走號呼，拿出錢來，並有許多很切實的計劃，把「手工」變爲「機械」，如揚州豪商的想「自己運了西洋機器來，紡織各種新奇花樣絲綢等類，奪他們外洋進來的絲布買賣（面五二），如戴山的改良茶業計劃（而七九），但是結果怎樣呢？經濟耗盡，事業無成，都被一些掮客部下，用新街語新口號哄騙，中飽來揮　盡了。錢伯廉，汪步靑，可以是這寫人物的代表。</p>
<p>姬文之意若曰：中國的工商業是一末一天的在向下衰落了，不事振興、將無出路。抱如此熱望，輸大　　濟的，並不楚沒有其人，如揚　　一豪商，粵南的巨賈。無如中國的商人，太沒有商業道德，太不想到事業，只會中飽，只會狂嫖浪賭，以至於什麽都無成，弄得有心人也裹足不敢前。他把這一切　露出來，引起大家的注意，希望有所改革。</p>
<p>雖然抓取怎樣的主題，是作者的完全自由，但從僅有的一部淸末的小說里，連工商戰的一點面影部看不到，只見風而沒有雨，總不能說不是一件遺憾，在這一點上，茅盾的「子夜」，眞是值得　傲的著作了。而「市聲」，也就不能不說是高於「情勝無一。</p>
<p>作者所想達到的目的，是相常做到了的。錢伯廉，注步靑幾個人物寫得也不差。到後來却也犯了當時作家的通病，誇大的寫，而目拉得甚遠。寫屎老爺的捐官，屎太太的請客，香老爺（因賣花發財的）家宴會，簡直是誇張到使人决不放信以為真，誠然寫得一滑稽可喜」，但離一現實一究竟太遠了。在當時的著作中，無論從那一方面說，這是一部水平綫上的作品。</p>
<p>此書最初發表於「繡像小說一，二十五回，未完。光緒三十四年（一九零八）由商務印單行本，二册，三十六回，全。可惜當時很少有人注　。所謂「商界現形記一，共二集，十六回，雲間天贅生著，商業會社印行，是一部極拙劣毫無足稱的書。寫的範圍，不外是商塲與妓院，如一電報傳來，火油飛漲：下堂求去，艶　仍張」（第四回）；施媚術歡塲常態，發議論商界奇談一（第八回；小玩要獨出頭錢，大排塲發行鈔票（第十六回之頭。</p>
<p>不過淸末的小說，涉及商人的却很多，有李伯元所寫的北京替人經手買官的錢商（官塲現形記），吳趼人明寫的卑　齷齪暴發的買辦（發財秘訣等。）但無論怎樣，我們沒有方法在當時小說里，找到完全的商業業動的面影，有「市聲一一書，已經是很不易了。商業活動，在現在是不應該這樣被忽視的，我很希望創作家們能向這，方而開拓，不要在有了「子夜」以後，又成絕響。特殊是希望生活在商塲而有文學興味的靑年，能勇敢的從事寫作。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>到上海來的日子也不算得少，然而，還不曾有過什麼病。倘如照一般婦人們的口吻來說，我還算是「順利平安」的一個。的確！我有着這一稱習慣，我往往咬着牙根的來表現出我的堅苦的精神，我不會因爲精神上的痛苦，身體上的孱弱而來表現出一種「少爺」模樣的病態，任性的躺在床上來表現出自己是病的。而且，右朋友會疑心我的病是不解的悒鬱病。—但，這也只由得　們去估量。我永遠沒有說出自己的病是爲了什麽、</p>
<p>然而，眞正的病已在慢性的悒鬱的心情裏產生了出來。</p>
<p>是月尾的時候，天空老是戴上了愁苦的花臉似的，吊下來深秋似的淒凉的雨。自己的肚子裏空空的已經是兩天的事，又沒有什麽朋友到我家裏來看我。我只得整天的在濕潤的街上跑着，疲乏的眼珠子在瞪着街上的景色。等到疲乏得要命的時候，我就跑回家裏，理在桌子上拼命的寫文章。</p>
<p>本來，拚命的寫文章是沒有用，但在這時候寫文章完全是爲了飢餓的痛苦，完全爲了精神上的刺激，而且，特別是這個時候就多着思潮，洶湧地，一幕一幕地　動着自己的腦袋！我不能不握着筆管拚命的來寫，而且越寫越多，威情特別豐富，所寫出的文章特別有勁，流利，又迅速。這，於是乎我很得意的自己對自己說：</p>
<p>「病是沒有什麽損　的，尤其是飢餓的病會增加了我的進步的。」於是，我不知不覺中就自己愉快了起來，忘記了自己的心痛，忘記了房租的催促，忘記了將來的長期間的飢餓。而且特別快樂的，寫了又寫，看了又看。一切的都達到興奮的程度了。</p>
<p>但是這種由於痛苦的中蔓延開來的病我開始頭昏，開始渴得要命，開始感到肺部的難過，開始感到肚子空而且有什麽東西在絞着腸藏的一樣痛苦，於是，我拋開了筆，靜靜的躺在床上，靜靜的房子裏只有聽到可怕的短促的呼吸聲。然而，我這時候已不能夠表示我不是病了，我已跟別此人們一樣，無法抵抗病魔的作崇，身體的熱度忽而高忽而冷的，盡是輾暫個不停的。到了夜裏，我依然不能夠睡覺，總是覺得這病不能不去看一看醫生，但是，提到看醫生，我就想到我的肺也該照一次X光鏡。不過錢呢？就是因爲飢餓了才起病的呀。這樣自咒着。就埋怨錢在作崇。可不是嗎？窮人永遠的是這樣苦一輩子的。</p>
<h3>巴山之夜</h3>
<p>— 段位岱</p>
<p>靑燐在幾處荒塚上燃着。</p>
<p>夜，只聽得蚊子聲，像一長串的突擊隊，向我們兩個人作總的進攻起來，在這個頹廢的老莊上。</p>
<p>我和楊的手，在每一個黃昏後，就得被老伙夫綱起來帶到一間　朽的牛棚內，這已經是一伴習慣了的常情。</p>
<p>白天，潤水嗚咽的響，我和他們都在吞着羊芋，默默的，互相觀照着，除了夕抗着一枝生了銹的來福槍或一把飾着紅纓子的才稈子之外，他們這百把人，幾乎跟我和楊兩個人一樣的受着難，頭髮裏生着蝨，沒有鹽吃，大便排洩不下來，擦着血紅的眼睛，差不多火眼症在這百把人裏，完全傳染得很化一，抬着沉重的腦袋，望着一綫的淡靑色的天空，像都是在期待着一個可活的生路。</p>
<p>他們完全忘掉我和楊這兩人要算是肉票了。</p>
<p>然而，日落西山，蚊子開始叫的時候，老伙夫總得照上司吩咐，據說是司令的口令，毫不疑誤的把我和楊綑到那一間黑朽的牛棚內去。</p>
<p>「老人家，做一點好事，煩勞你燒一把篙子，把蚊子趕開去一吓」</p>
<p>『嗡，要得，要得，自然蚊子咬不到我們啦！」</p>
<p>於是篙子的氣味，很強烈的刺入人的鼻孔裏來，使楊這小雜貨店的夥計，嗅慣了醫油鹹菜桔餅跟紙烟混合味道的年靑人，都實在大膽忍受不住了，喀嗤喀嗤，不斷的打着噴涕。老伙夫，一手持住矛桿子，一手趕快掏出葉子菸，把腦壳抬起來，望着對河亂山上的大月亮。</p>
<p>「晦，說老實話，這刻工夫，你倒底是做啥事的呀！』</p>
<p>「呃，當眞，我是文昌廟教書的呀』。我默然的順應着。</p>
<p>「嗡，那麼，沒有啥事……』</p>
<p>老伙夫吧吧的吸着鐵烟嘴。</p>
<p>這是已經弄慣，成爲定規的，過了若干夜。</p>
<p>然而，今天的黃昏就不同前，山裏各處冒着火焰，在很遠的山尖上，在隔嶺的那面溝裏，都傳來幾聲槍響，這是一兩個月來很少看到的變相。</p>
<p>我和楊默然的坐在稻草上，讓蚊子嗡嗡的亂飛，靜靜的窺着院塲上的黑蠕蠕的移動的人影，幾根枯桑脚下，透過來磨刀的聲音。他們完全很驚慌的動亂着，像正準備應付一個非常的襲擊。這一刻，牛棚門首已沒有看守人，我和楊都不想跑，實際的情形，已是幾縣的路都斷絕了人跡了。</p>
<p>我黯然的靜默着。</p>
<p>「你們倒底是做啥事的呀！」</p>
<p>『教書。』</p>
<p>『學生意的呀？你老人家早知道。嗨嗨』小店伙搶說着。</p>
<p>『嗡，那麽……那麽……』</p>
<p>「那麼該放我們啦。』</p>
<p>『放你們的氣！』</p>
<p>『噫，怎麼，你老人家？』</p>
<p>『聽到啦，司令說你們兩個是那邊探子呀！」</p>
<p>『呢。呃。實在是教書，還不是跟你們一樣的難過生活嗎？」</p>
<p>「唉，你不像本地人，你那裏人呀！」</p>
<p>「文昌廟，離你們這裏二百里。』</p>
<p>『唔，你這笨小伙子，說　了一步，司令說要先送掉你們啦！聽，那邊的衝鋒號不是又響過來了嗎？』</p>
<p>老伙夫抗着矛子，慌忙的跑到屋後去，只現着一串蠕動的黑影子。</p>
<p>火光已經逼到這個司令部的營門外前了。</p>
<p>「嗒嘀嗒嘀噠……」</p>
<p>這一隊很笨重的土匪，帶着農民的固執勁，都爬到老莊後的靑崗林裏，嗄嘎的裝着來福槍的鐵沙子，準備跟那一路遠來的軍隊拚一陣。因爲他們已經沒有生路，田，牛，榖子；只好靠着老朽的來福槍，矛稈子，跟殘喘了。</p>
<p>天還未大明，星子照在滿山空裏，激流呵呵的叫着，向着天上亂打的槍聲，已經完全沒有聽到後，他們百把人，全被人家包圍，俘虜過去了。</p>
<p>老伙夫，打着火把，來釋放了我們兩張肉票，這又算是奉的另一方面帶頭的口令。</p>
<p>「隊長我們的隊長叫你們走啦！哈哈。』老伙夫很親熱的執行着這個新任務</p>
<p>我和楊很輕快的恢複了自由。</p>
<p>巴山的夜，在很靜穆的和諧的嚴肅的行軍裏，向南方的一顆曙星，漫漫的爬行着。</p>
<h3>大學時代（二九）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>「這樣跑了一會。「如果老太婆走出來啊，』我想，她是要大發雷霆的！」但她沒有來。　此時突然有一　鴿子嘩啦一下從院子上面飛過去；那馬吃了一驚，跳了起來。我想娜麗一定要倒栽下來的；但是她並沒有跌下地來，還均在馬底頸項上面，只嚇得像死人一般蒼白。「呵哈，威爾幾尼！」伯爵先生對馬喊，早已跳了過去，把娜麗抱在手臂裏，凝視了她一會，然後讓她輕輕落在地上。—我的心情還未會安定，忽然院門響了。「老太婆來了！」我想；但我轉過身看時，却是那個本工站在我的面前。—如果是老太婆的話婆那我還不會這樣慌亂哩慌木工像石頭人一樣站着。「已經是節日前晚了麽，魏爾納先生？」我喊。但她沒有聽我的話。「祝你晚安，瑪麗！」他用着完全暗啞的聲音，似乎有物塞在喉嚨在使他的話哽住了說不出來。—「我們到屋子裏面去，好麽？「我又說。「我想，」他回答，「你們已經有人在這裏了。」—沒有看小姑娘一眼，也沒有對她說一句話，他便回轉身子，經過大門走出街上去。</p>
<p>「娜麗站在喘息的馬旁，一點沒有動。「這個人幹甚麽來的？伯爵問。「他是我的一個同鄉，「她回答。「他是魏爾納先生」我說，「傢俱公司底丁頭。」伯爵底面孔使我發氣，他諷刺地看着那個木工。」</p>
<p>瑪麗正做完一件工作，她站了起來，把衣物牧拾做一堆。隔壁房　裏，同住的房客已經　齊，要坐下吃飯了。</p>
<p>「後來怎麽樣結果的」我還問一句。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣結果麽」？她重覆我的話說；「我在兩方面奔走了好久，說了一大堆的話：最後！那個木工是不能夠離開她的，至於她，那她如果不是發瘋了的話，就可以明白這木工對她有甚麽關係了。那些高貴美貌的少爺們是沒有她的份兒的！」</p>
<p>我們坐下去吃飯。但跛脚瑪麗剛才談說的故事，使我心裏很難過。—麗和克里斯多夫！我不能夠把這二個人合在一起來想像。</p>
<p>散步</p>
<p>復活節後我的　親突然病了，把我呌回家裏去。直至八月間她纔痊愈，我不放心讓父親單獨調理她，讓溫和的空氣繼續醫治她，而自己復到大學讀書去。我動身回家時候，大學城近旁寬闊海灣裏冰塊還沒有完全融化；現在一路上都是濃陰的夏葉蕭蕭作響了。</p>
<p>這是我複來後第二日上午；我還未曾去拜會，個朋友。我深思地站在寂寞的書室中間；儘上枯乾的墨水瓶和耶些佈滿灰塵的書籍，憂鬱地靜對着我；地板上一半打開的衣箱更助成了這憂愁情致。但太陽從玻璃窗照進來，誘引我到外面去；不久我就走出門了，我在孩童時代　喜歡個、散步，現在也是一個人在寬閱蔭道上榆樹影子底子走着；這蔭道有一段路是沿着海堤在海水旁邊走的。</p>
<p>闊大的樹造成一種陰晦的　遮蓋在我頭上；路底兩旁，葉子上，草上以及藏在綠陰裏面的團亭窗戶上，都有明亮的朝陽閃耀　；有時，在樹本稀疏的地方，平滑的海水還能映射在我眼睛。—我慢慢向前走去，放開胸脯　量呼吸新鮮空氣；路上只遇見幾個不相識的人，因爲散步底鐘點還未曾來到。</p>

<h3>自殺不足以救國</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>據寗夏通訊，頃寗朔縣縣長牟鳳鳴，因悲憤國難，投河自殺，屍身尙未撈獲，遺有絕命書，冀喚醒國人。書云：亡國之禍，迫在眉睫，嗚不忍視吾黃帝子孫，淪爲他人之奴隸，甘願投河殉國，喚醒國人，寗爲刀下鬼，不作亡國奴，庶有力圖挽救，收復山河之一日。</p>
<p>我國幾年來，一遇國難發生，常有愛國志士，捐軀殉國者。牟縣長今亦因悲痛國事，而投河自殺。其志可嘉，其情可憫，然其態度，實爲吾人所不取。蓋我國國難，現時已臨於危急關頭。救亡圖存之計，端賴全國同胞，羣策羣力以赴之，庶中國復興有望。不幸一部分憂國人民，每痛國事日非，卽憤而自殺。殊不知自殺乃一種消極行爲，不但於國事無益，且足以喪失國家之力量。故國人旣能悲憤國難，便應起而救國，盡匹夫應盡之責，爲國致力。倘人人捐軀殉國，試問國難要靠誰挽回？</p>
<p>聞牟縣長爲一熱心愛國者，年來痛心國難，每與同事慨嘆國事，輒吟岳武穆滿江紅詞，慷慨悲歌。今歲出宰朔邑，甫經半載，勤政愛民，成績卓著。近因外交吃緊，國勢岌岌，感時灑淚，悲憤愈深，遂决計投河殉國，冀喚起同胞之覺悟。牟縣長之死，實殊可惜。彼爲一愛國愛民之地方官，倘能改其消極行爲，積極爲國家努力，則國家受賜不淺。</p>
<p>故吾人奉勸一般有志愛國同胞，解除國難，復與民族，惟賴我四萬萬人民，負起救國之責。吾人與其捐軀殉國，毌寧留此有用之身，爲國效勞，死且不惜，何事不可爲哉·</p>

<p>午後攝氏寒暑表爬上最高的項點：村莊躺在火盆的驕陽大喘息着，野狗子躱到籬落間吐出舌根子搖尾巴，樹木擺着發霉的臉孔。乾燥的泥土味被挾在突然刮起來的狂風裏向四處飛揚，幾陣風刮過後，再跟幾聲嚮雷，天猛的變了：一大塊一大塊的雲朶打東南角那兒飄，凝集起來，成爲山似的那麽龐大一幅了，一下子天便暗下來，太陽也沒了，於是風接着刮得越够勁，雷也嚮得越振耳，電花一閃一閃在馳駛着。雲陣愈往下墮，雨就愈像馬上掉落來，人們都躲入屋子裏，期望雨快的降。</p>
<p>然而陳七爺他却不是這樣想。他怕雨又來了。雨在另一些人救了命，可是在他倒是要了命，他在院階上望着天，望雨就要來的暗天，望着一閃一閃打眼前晃過去的電光，他縐着眉，像一隻猢猻發着急，連夕的嘆着氣。跑了進去，坐下，沒坐穩，又跑出來，跑出來踱了回兒又轉進去，莫明其妙的儘頓足，臉上一會兒變紫，一會兒又變靑。</p>
<p>—唉，我不應那麼大意，如果這侖子又像去年一述下了幾天雨，不就是一切都完了。</p>
<p>他沒完沒結地自語着，他記起去年做屯糧生意正當可以大賣價的當兒，不做美的老天徧下了幾天大雨，田水是充足了，於是糧價猛落了，他不但沒撈着一個銅子錢，甚至述本都賠個精光。不要又是碰了這霉頭。他全身有些發冷。雷嚮了一下，他的心便震了一下，可是雷彷彿存心合他作梗，他越是鬧別扭，雷越是嚮的密而且嘹喨。</p>
<p>—老爺，太太請你用飯，時侯不早了。</p>
<p>一個小婢在後邊輕輕叫着，他正在一肚子火沒處洩，這可觸了他的鋒頭，他身也不轉，便吼的駡着：</p>
<p>—混蛋，滾你的。小婢不提防嚇了一陣走了。</p>
<p>於是是輪着兒子跑出來：</p>
<p>—爸爸，吃飯，吃飯。媽叫的。</p>
<p>他還是照樣高聲的叱道：</p>
<p>誰要吃飯，你爸爸快要死了，滾，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>媽的。</p>
<p>「哇」的一聲，幼小的不懂事的孩子給叱哭了。母親聽見哭聲，一勁走出來抱起了孩子，一邊咕噥：</p>
<p>—沒好氣，往兒子身上出。</p>
<p>電光雷嚮又大鬧一陣，他的心又卜卜跳了一陣。</p>
<p>—完了，完了。他感到此刻自己不知怎的特別脆弱，膽虛起來。</p>
<p>這回陳七爺眞是免不了如此急煞，因為陳七爺的起家，以至在街上開了兩個在這小村鎮上算為頭等大商店的雜貨鋪子，村鄰們是沒個不知都是做屯糧發財的，又因為近幾年來年頭終是不好，他每次的屯糧生意就差不多拿穩地賺大錢。去年呢，那是出人意外的失敗，好在那番他剛好並沒大做，所以雖然遭打擊，對他的家財一點也無影響。而此後他的膽特別壯假來，他老想大規模幹它一下，撈個一萬八千，從此洗手不幹，清閑過日子。今年三月裏芒種時候，整整一個月沒見點滴雨水，田地龜裂，誰也不能把秧種栽下，就是栽下的也死在土地裏，卽出來因缺少水份，不幾久都乾了。於是他彷佛十分把握，看準了似的，把全部的財產全抽出去屯了糧，他的黃金夢他的生命綫整個支付在那上邊了。他成日裏心房好像吊上來，魂不附身似的，沒別的，儘打發門下人到外邊去探聽糧價的起落，有時候他也自家冒着大熱天出去，還好，打他的糧屯定那天起，個把月的光景，天永遠是一片無邊的蔚藍的色，雨是絕跡了的，只有原野不斷地在雜奏着鳴呀的似乎在慘叫着的車水戽水的聲音。而當耳前耳後聽到一種絕望的帶着咒罵的口氣，說什麼：</p>
<p>—他媽的王八羔子，老天再不下雨，簡直要收命，誰準得會餓死了的。</p>
<p>這反正是給陳七爺一個預告的喜訊，人們愈感到慌，感到活不下，他就愈是感到他發財的日子愈近。他捋了捋嘴邊兩撇濃鬍子，一面微笑，一面自管呢喃着：</p>
<p>—哼，一點沒瞧錯，幹得對勁，天是有眼睛的。</p>
<p>—天眞是沒眼睛的，戳它妹子，</p>
<p>陳七爺在歌頌天是有眼睛的時候，也許另一幫正在這樣相反地毒罵的。</p>
<p>可是上月里邊忽然下雨了，雖並不大，沒像去年一下就是二寸深的水，却也接連灑了三五天，稼莊人家是稍微鬆了口氣，臉上有絲笑容，因為糧食價錢為回了一下頭，這在陳七爺便幾幾乎隨着好幾吃不下，睡不落，有如害寒熱症似的，一天面孔五顏六色的變。</p>
<p>幸而雨停了，幾天微雨對於久旱的堅硬的田地並不能發生絲毫好處，原野上還是無數的車子的戽水聲哆呀於毒太陽之下。</p>
<p>陳七爺這才把懸上去的心解下來。</p>
<p>繼着一直到現在快滿兩個月，又是沒雨，天：蔚藍的無邊的一片，彷佛凝結了似的。秧苗都躺下去等待更強烈的太陽收拾枯死，野草也成了卷了。於是糧價跟着一天天往上飛，一石粟從十塊直漲到十五塊，還沒定，還在繼續的漲。</p>
<p>陳七爺自然又捋了捋他的鬍子，坐在陰凉的別墅中微笑着。</p>
<p>村上人却個個抱了一種懼的候死的心，小孩子雖然照舊的玩，到底掩不住臉上的菜黃色！</p>
<p>—媽拉巴子，眞是非迫人去當土匪不可！</p>
<p>年輕伙子都把念頭想歪了地胡說，</p>
<p>用人力似乎終轉移不了天意，於是木柴頭的雨仙爺菩薩交運了，久久沒人到過的冷靜的廟落一月來是從早到晚是擠塞了無數的男女，村人們都甘願將日食省了點去沽幾串紙綻香燭，另後懷了顆虔誠的心，在雨仙菩薩殿前連連地磕頭。再另後是大家凑錢造祭壇，央幾個黃袍道士，禁屠三天，菩薩在第一天給抬出來了。</p>
<p>這一天打清早起，鑼鼓哨子便熱鬧地充滿一村子，菩薩從大街到小巷落，全村走個遍。</p>
<p>—求雨仙爺顯靈，賜福，活活小民的命。</p>
<p>大家瞥見菩薩一面也讓太陽晒得淌汗的死臉孔喞喞着。</p>
<p>遊過陳七爺的別墅前邊，他也跑出來看，帶着輕蔑的語氣暗自說着！</p>
<p>—鄉愚，都是大傻瓜，這是天意，菩薩有鳥用？</p>
<p>其實陳七爺也决不是個非神論者，他那樣說，不過是生怕菩薩抬出來果眞就降下雨，那他可完了。</p>
<p>實在是天意哩。個把禮拜過去了。</p>
<p>天：依然是無邊的蔚藍一片，太陽愈高，空氣愈乾燥，雨是金子那麼希貴了，雨菩薩也沒有法兒。</p>
<p>同時瘟疫在扇起血腥的翅膀了，村上每天有人病倒，給抓住了的乾是攤在床上翻轉，呻吟，死活讓它去，讓命運去判决，而每天就可以看見一行人跟着誰個裝在隻薄木棺材里邊的人流着淚從村前的一條大路向原野的山莊走去。</p>
<p>小動物都忙着搬家。</p>
<p>陳七爺也想在這時候搬家，到城里去。</p>
<p>而他每天所希望着的！粟子能漲到一石三十就好，因此天上要是浮一朶雲，或雷在響着，他遍不安起來，他担心一陣大雨會卽刻將他整個希望完了蛋。</p>
<p>今天午後的光景他差實覺得有些怕，山似的暗雲老不散開的堆在中天，兇猛的雷不住地打，彷佛一下子會把天炸破，—雨傾盆地落，……使他胸膈間好像插進一把尖刀子。</p>
<h3>捕</h3>
<p>— 陳少白作</p>
<h3>松林的記憶</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>故鄉雖是山多之地，但我家住的村落，可在四面環山的平陽之中。當天清日麗，站在屋門前舉目四矚，遠遠的黛色的山巒峰影，柔靜無語，連綿環繞四周，恰好將村　廓成一個渾圓的小天地。清晨夕暮，抹在山峰邊頂之上的奇幻的光暈，常常使我幼小的心乳融在幻覺之中；對於山的愛慕，自然地在心上刻了一個很深的印痕了。有時，一些從山里出來的親戚，或者過往的路客口中，總有許多新鮮奇趣的事情演述出來：山猪，狐狸，黑夜松林間老虎的眼睛，……許多我們聽來都會駭得色變的事故，他們說來可極其自然無事。因此，　加深了我對山的神秘的想像，覺得山裏雖然有野獸可怕，總不脫為有趣好玩的地方。</p>
<p>這些雖說是童年的心境；但現在一經挑醒，都還是很濃厚的，都是從來對於山的一切究竟太隔遠了。所以現在雖有無數人事，生活的鉛塊沉在心頭，使我童年的天眞漸漸掩抑下去，我總還覺得山是非常神秘可愛的。</p>
<p>因此，我總忘不掉外婆屋後的小山，和山上的松林。那座小山，其實只能說是一個小小的坵　，但在我沒有踏過深山大嶺的幼小的心里，一朝登上那里，穿走松林之下，迎風呼跳，又是如何有趣高興的了！</p>
<p>那時外公還健在，很崇　「祖師」，一月里總有三五次「拜祖師」的法事舉行；因此母親也在外公家里的時候多。表弟比我只少一些，因為外婆太過疼愛了，平時是不容輕易走出門庭一步的，屋後的小山簡直是禁地。我和姊姊比起其他村孩子雖然馴謹一些，較之表弟，可頑皮得多。我們一來，許多為外婆不容許的頑皮事，也就有表弟的份鬧起來了；最受怨责的也是給舅母們在小山上找回去的時候，外婆必然抱天怨地的嘮叨一番。</p>
<p>在山上玩得最起勁的是在松樹根下拕「沙蜘蛛」——這是一種藏在鬆土里的善門的小動物，因形態像蜘蛛，我們就給了牠一個沙蜘蛛的名字——其次是拾松子比賽。捉沙蜘蛛是需要經驗和方法的，也最有趣處，先要在光滑明净的鬆土上面，判認牠的巢穴，然後用一塊石片，稍微用力的插進土去趕快一翻；若果插得淺，動作又遲，就會給牠逃走。大約捉到三四隻，就可席地圍坐一圈，放出這小小的戰士去輪流鬥戰。小孩子的心有時也會天眞得偏於殘忍的，遇着自己的戰士打敗了，常常使出各種殘酷的磨折去結果戰敗者的性命。</p>
<p>拾松子比賽則常在剛由山下爬上山去的時候，那時都正興致勃勃，只要有一個呼嘯一聲，這幕有趣的比賽就完成了。亂跑亂跳的結果是鬧得面紅耳赤，滿頭流汗。在當晚拜完祖師，臥在門坪里「打露」的時候，松香氤氳之下，我們的興趣可不在道士門入定「悟道」的滑稽的引逗中，而是相互私語日間在松林里鬧的得意了。</p>
<p>外公死後，不久我卽跟祖母飄流到遼遠的蘭貢去。在那一段異國生活中，我漸漸走出了童年的天國，一些成年人的覺醒，使我對於自己的言動思想都大大的改變了。及後南旋北轉，在家的時期也就極少。前年暑假還家，外婆卽以受家道衰落的刺激一病長瞑。那天送了外婆的靈柩入土後，回來屋里人擠，天氣又熱，就和幾個姨表兄爬上那座小山松林里　散一回；時正當牛，赤日灸空，風來松濤微動，想起眼前的凄愁之景，過去的歡樂的舊事，松林雖依舊，人事已滄桑了。</p>
<p>而今，外婆已死了四年長久；二舅還是終日一榻橫陳，吞雲吐霧；那位表弟前回雖聞說已把烟癮斷了，確否究未敢信；大舅母經一病之後已百事淡然，一個七零八　的家只二舅母一人掙扎着去支撐，這慘痛的敗落，想來是傷心的。自己呢，這兩年來的流離生涯，也負荷了不少人生的艱苦的担子；那童年一段的松林的舊事，記憶起來雖也動情，究不免帶點苦澀味了。</p>

<h3>為初習汽車駕駛者建議</h3>
<p>— 方逸鷺</p>
<p>假使你是個車主的話。那麽再假定你現在從車行裏新購一輛汽車的時候。你得向那車行裏的人問個明白。各部份如何管理。運用的方法怎樣。須得呌他們給你解釋得詳詳細細。</p>
<p>你剛不久學會了開汽車。當然没有什麽經騐可言。再者。對於汽車各部的構造和運動。更是糢糊。而還没有正確的認識。那麽你所購得的新車經你一度試車以後。我以為你最好再到你購買你那輛新車的行家去問個澈底。將你所有一切疑難之點。求個準確的解釋。這樣實地探究較之僅僅讀幾頁説明書要高明得多。因為在你看見了實在的一切機件之後。再讀説明書。非但容易懂得説明書上所講的什麽。並且還事半功倍呢。</p>
<p>假使環境可能的話。最初學習的時候最好是在車輛稀少與平坦的馬路上開始。其後。各部的管理慢慢的熟了。就在傾斜的路上行駛。並且還得練熟時停時行而不致慌忙。此外。倒車你也得開得很好。</p>
<p>目前的新式汽車大概都在變速器上裝着所謂諧動裝置。這種裝置的功用。一方面是使換排時不論何種速度下齒輪不會發岀聲響。另一方面。就是使換排容易。因為從前没有諧動裝置的變速器。於調排時確乎不能粗率從事。尤其在一般初習駕駛者更感到困難。現在。有了這種諧動裝置以後。調排的困難是完全消除了。</p>
<p>話雖如此。要使車行平穩乘坐者舒適起見。以下幾條你須得特别注意。庶幾對於這變換速度（即換排）的重要動作。可以擅長。</p>
<p>（一）移動排擋須從容不廹一切不可大快。當將排擋撥入使齒輪嚙合的時候。須緩緩撥下。尤其是車行於高速度時。這個將排擋緩緩撥下的動作。其目的在允許那諧動裝置有充分的時間去使各齒輪接近至相當的速度。</p>
<p>（二）在接合接脱器（即放下克拉子）以前。常用加速蹬（即風門）使引擎速度調準至相當速度。</p>
<p>從低擋換到高一擋排的時候。譬如從頭擋換到二擋。或從二擋換到三擋的時候。須將加速蹬放去。讓引擎速度降下。從高一擋換到低一擋排的時候。譬如從三擋換到二擋。或從二擋換到頭擋的時候。須將加速蹬踏下少些。使引擎速度加高點。凡此二點均須特别留意做到。否則整個的變速器將受到極大的損傷。換排時車行的速度愈高。接脱器接合前換排擋的時間須愈長。如此。可使引擎速度達到吻合變速器内的速度。而車的行駛得到平穩與舒適。</p>
<p>究竟何種引擎速度之下。接脱器接合時才能非常平滑無震。經騐就立刻會告訴你去判斷這種速度。於車行速度很高的時候。除非你已是一個老練的汽車駕駛者。你切不要從三擋換到二擋。也不要在二擋排能勝任的最高車行速度之下這樣換排。</p>
<p>（三）任何情形之下。接脱器須得緩緩放下。以免車子受震。接脱器的所以要緩緩放下。是使引擎與變速器即有些微的速度相差可以自己調和。而於變速器上没有什麽壓廹。</p>
<p>你得使你自己精於換排。這是最要緊。在車子慢下來以後不要就在高擋排勉强踏下加速蹬想使車子加快。這會使引擎「勞於奔波」。你要養成一種好習慣。善於利用排擋。在上山坡的時候。小轉灣的時候。及其他情形車子慢下來。再使牠快起來的時候。你要常常不忙記從高擋換到中擋排。或由中擋換到低擋排。轉灣的時候。須預先將車慢下來。切不要衝到轉角處再突然煞車。這會使車制和車胎受到額外損壞。</p>
<p>我以為你最好不要駕駛到車子的最高速率。除非你已經能駕駛得很嫻熟了。待你的駕駛經騐漸漸的增進以後。隨後再漸次增高你的駕駛速率。這能使你免去不少因冒失而發生的危險。</p>
<p>你駕駛着一輛汽車時。最好不使車行速度忽快忽慢。因為在平恒速度之下。汽油的消耗最比較經濟。反之。引擎速度忽高忽低之下。燃料耗費極大。</p>
<p>萬一因某種原因冷却系裏的水耗損過多。而致引擎於過熱的時候。切勿貿然把冷水加下。須等引擎冷下後再加。</p>
<h3>海外汽車情報</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>美國汽車産量增進　近來美國的汽車製造事業。又有蓬勃上進的現象了。各製造廠對於製造新車是非常活躍的。在五月底邊左右。有五家汽車廠努力的生産。將車輸岀。他的數量比之一九三四年十二個月中所製造的還要多哩。此外兩家汽車廠的岀品。也和這個生産紀錄不相上下。在六月份之前。當然他們的産量一樣的非常可觀。其他各廠所造的新車。在月底邊算起來。也要超過一九三四年的産量。今年開首以來的五個月。拿美國全部的汽車事業統計起來。各廠所造的汽車總共一，九八八，六三七輛。這個正式的統計。拿一九三四年同時期來比較。其增進約近百分之三十五。至於六月份的産量。如果幾家大製造廠。仍舊這樣的努力着。那末今年的半年産額。將要超過二，○○○，○○○輛的數目了。一九三五年的全年既有了這個根基。四，○○○，○○○輛的超過。是似乎綽綽有餘的。在最低價汽車的福特。雪佛蘭，潑萊茅斯·之集團外。據聞這次汽車的增加為中價汽車云。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍氏在法逝世　號稱為「法蘭西的亨利福特」的雪鐵龍氏。本月三日在法京巴黎逝世。雪氏的身體向來很壯健的。所以他的突然物化。岀於一般人的意料之外。最近經醫士的檢查結果。舉行了一次手術。可是體力不濟。終於去世。雪鐵龍汽車的製作良佳。大量生産。不但在法蘭西著名。就是在歐洲也是數一數二的。所以雪氏在法國汽車界中實執牛耳。他生前常到美國去遊歷。對於美國人的生産方法。很是崇拜。回國之後。便去應用。成績很好。雪鐵龍今年五十七歳。生於一八七八年二月五日。早年苦學於巴黎的著名工藝學院。畢業後從事小工塲的製作。起初規模極小。只有僱工十一人。一個人身兼廠長監工工頭推銷諸職。開業後第一年的營業數量祗有一五，○○○法朗。到了第四年增至一○○，○○○法朗。他臨死的時候。雪鐵龍廠每天的營業就要達四，○○○，○○○法朗之多。大戰的時候。他服務法國。很著功勳。</p>
<p>美國汽車肇禍可驚。美國汽車肇禍的事件。一天多似一天。常年䘮失生命於車輪下的。不計其數。雖然當局想盡方法來防止。可是見效尚不甚著。所以一般人説。在别種事年上。大家都寶貴自己的生命。惟有在公路街道上却儘多不小心的人。在一千九百十三年的時候。美國各地因為汽車肇禍而失掉生命的。計共四二二七人。待到一九三四年。便一躍而增至三六，○○○人。而在同時呢。因為别種意外肇禍事件而致人於死的。却為之减少。在一九一三年時計七八，二三三人。去年减到六五，○○○人。一九三四年時市上的汽車較之一九三一年時自屬增加不少。可是同時人口方面也增加着。計增進百分之三十一。所令人不解的。就是汽車增多。車輛肇禍事件亦隨之增進。而另一方面呢。人口雖然年有增加。而意外事件的死亡率。像由於家庭·工廠·及社會其他活動等·却為隨之而减少。</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Bankers Association Establishes Bank Acceptance Drafts</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The tightness or looseness of liquidity in the market is certainly reflected in quantity, but its effectiveness should not be judged by quantity alone. It should be judged by its utilization. If utilization is indeed smooth and unhindered, then what does it matter if liquidity is scarce? If utilization lacks agility, then what good is abundance of liquidity? If we are speaking of the amount of liquidity, then why did the United States, known as the kingdom of gold, experience a financial panic in the past year? And why did Fengjixi issue the most drafts in the past, while the people of the three northeastern provinces suffered greatly? All of this shows that liquidity is a matter of utilization, and the ability to utilize it sufficiently depends on the general level of credit. In the past, businesses relied on a simple promissory note with their signature and seal affixed and paid it to the person delivering the goods. The recipient had no doubts. When the payment was due, there were no problems. In recent years, due to various reasons, the credit system of the past has almost completely broken down, and those responsible for regulating finance have either been reluctant to release funds or have been unable to circulate them themselves due to contractions in various sectors. As a result, the market has inevitably fallen into stagnation. However, this cannot be entirely attributed to the amount of liquidity. It is actually a matter of general credit.</p>
<p>Credit cannot be obtained by chance, nor can it be obtained by coercion. The same note, once accepted, is now rejected. Or one person rejects it, while another accepts it. This acceptance and rejection is not a problem with the note itself. It is actually a matter of the credit of the issuer. If the credit is strong, people will accept it even if the term is long. If the credit is weak, people will still harbor doubts even if the payment is immediate. Therefore, how to restore credit in the market is how to dispel general anxiety. It is a major prerequisite for rescuing industry and commerce. Now, all rules and regulations regarding commercial loans have been announced, and there is even talk of implementing loans on August 1st. This is certainly good news for industry and commerce. However, even with funds, they should be utilized wisely, so that one penny has the effect of three or four pennies. Otherwise, it will still be insufficient to alleviate the urgency of today. The Bankers Association, aware of this, has stepped forward to issue acceptance drafts. This is truly an essential step at present.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, the Bankers Association's issuance of bank acceptance drafts is handled by a bill acceptance office separately established by the Bank Preparatory Committee. Any commercial or industrial customer with tangible goods can apply to the office for an acceptance draft. After the office assesses the value, it will issue a draft for the corresponding amount. It can then be taken to any member bank for discounting. At the same time, in terms of credit, in addition to the specific goods serving as the first form of tangible security, there is also a fund recognized by the joint reserve of the Bankers Association as the second form of security. As a result, a single draft will circulate repeatedly, and its effectiveness as liquidity will be maximized. The strength of its creditworthiness will naturally be beyond the reach of the average entity.</p>
<p>Moreover, these acceptance drafts are limited to distribution to domestic goods factories producing flour, cotton yarn, grains, oils, cement, and export goods. In essence, the goal is to develop the domestic goods production industry and support exports. The urgent need to support our domestic goods industry and export business has been widely discussed. Now, the Bankers Association has established acceptance drafts, clearly stipulating their use. This is truly a guarantee for the development of our country's industry and commerce. We can only hope that it will be implemented soon to satisfy the aspirations of the business community.</p>

<h3>Yangtze Flour Company Labor-Management Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A labor-management agreement has been reached at the Yangtze Flour Company. Both sides acted with utmost sincerity, resolving the matter immediately. The company will pay two and a half months' salary. Five measures were established regarding the factory's closure and worker layoffs: (1) The 63,403 bags of flour and 703 bags of bran belonging to the Datong Flour Company and stored in the Yangtze Flour Factory's warehouse will not be obstructed by Yangtze Flour Factory workers from being freely unloaded by the Datong Flour Company. (2) According to the Factory Law, the Yangtze Flour Factory should provide laid-off workers with one month's wage as a dismissal notice payment. To be considerate of the workers' actual needs, it is stipulated that those with less than three years of service (working period) will be calculated as three years. (3) The Yangtze Flour Factory has consistently paid workers double salary for one month at the end of each year, meaning 13 months of wages per year. This time, with the closure, the double salary for this year should be paid. (4) Worker wages have always been calculated monthly. Although the Yangtze Flour Factory announced its closure on July 17th, workers should be paid their full month's wages for July. (5) When the Yangtze Flour Factory resumes operations in the future, the original workers will have priority in employment. The management should issue workers a certificate of employment according to the law. The Yangtze Flour Factory's representatives who attended agreed to these measures and replied to the Bureau of Social Affairs at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that they would comply. At the same time, party, government, military, and police authorities dispatched personnel to inform the workers of this decision on the afternoon of the 23rd and to discuss the implementation of the five items. Execution was approved on the 24th: (1) The Bureau of Social Affairs will print and distribute the minutes of the meeting to relevant authorities and parties. (2) The party, government, military, and police authorities will jointly issue a public notice, drafted and signed by the Bureau of Social Affairs and submitted. (3) After the public notice is issued, the Yangtze Flour Factory will immediately issue severance pay to the workers, with personnel from various authorities dispatched to the site to supervise and military and police authorities to increase the number of constables to maintain order. (4) The public notice is scheduled to be posted on the afternoon of the 24th, and procedures for issuing payments will begin immediately. (5) The issue of the Datong Flour Company unloading goods will be handled opportunistically during the payment process to avoid conflict. As for the deduction issue, the Datong Factory rented the Yangtze Factory's workshops for three periods of ten days each between April and June. Subsequently, they continued to rent for one month from June 15th to July 15th. Unexpectedly, Yangtze announced its closure. Datong's more than 60,000 bags of flour were stored in the warehouse and could not be transported in time, causing complications. In reality, these are not Yangtze's property and have nothing to do with the Yangtze Factory itself. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Authorities Confiscate Hong Kong Privately-Run Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong military police suddenly confiscated various privately-run Hong Kong newspapers, including Circulation, Overseas Chinese, Daguan, and Industrial and Commercial Daily, being transported to the province on the 23rd. However, government-run newspapers were not. The reason is unknown. No explicit ban on newspapers has been issued by the official authorities. The Guangdong authorities previously cracked down on Hong Kong newspapers reporting news about the changes of key Guangdong figures, and this is suspected to be related.

<h3>Major Reshuffle of Japanese Army Generals; Mainstream Faction Appointed to Key Positions; Tada Shun, Well-Versed in China's Situation; The Truth Behind Umezu's Transfer to Division Commander</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Orders for personnel changes in the army were issued on the afternoon of the 22nd. Minister of the Army Hayashi most strongly clashed with Education Director-General Masaki over the issue of removing Lieutenant General Hata Shunji, commander of the Second Division. The Minister of the Army then dismissed Masaki and, according to his plan, removed Lieutenant General Hata, who had been in office for less than a year, implementing control within the army. The resignations of three important figures, Hata Shunji, Hishikari Takashi, and Matsui Iwane, are the most noteworthy aspects of this reshuffle. The dismissal of Hishikari and Matsui as military councilors is a necessary condition for refreshing the internal structure of the army. The Minister of the Army originally intended to promote Lieutenant General Koiso, commander of the ever-rumored Takekawa Tenth Division, and Lieutenant General Koiso, commander of the Fifth Division. However, to avoid complications, they were temporarily transferred to Chief of the General Staff and Director-General of Aviation, intending to appoint them to key positions in the next reshuffle. The Minister of the Army has gathered figures from the mainstream faction he supports in key positions in the central government, namely appointing Colonel Ishiwara Kanji as Director of Operations of the General Staff, Colonel Ishimoto as Head of the Research Section, and Lieutenant Colonel Kagesa as Head of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section. He also appointed Lieutenant Colonel Hanatani to an important position in the Kwantung Army. In short, the overall direction of this reshuffle is based on Minister of the Army Hayashi's policy of controlling the military. The Masaki General and Hata Lieutenant General, who disrupted control, have been swept away. However, in order to avoid provoking the power of this faction, the central leadership has not transferred Umezu, Commander of the China Garrison Army, but has promoted him to Commander of the Second Division. Tada Shun, the new Commander of the China Garrison Army, has lived in China for a long time and is one of the most knowledgeable people in the army regarding China's situation. During the September 18th Incident, he served as a member of the East Army Headquarters and concurrently as an advisor to the military and political department of "Manchukuo". It is worth noting what policies he will implement towards North China in the future. (Jiji Press Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This major reshuffle in the army has attracted attention from all sides. Those awaiting orders, such as Lieutenant General So Shunji, are particularly noteworthy as they are figures of controversy. It was expected that Lieutenant Generals Koiso and Takekawa, who would enter the central military department, would not be transferred. Although they seemed dissatisfied, Minister of the Army Hayashi took a position of integrity, disregarding people's opinions, hence this move. General Masaki and Lieutenant General Hata, who had been criticized, were boldly dealt with this time, which no one dared to change before. This has an enormous effect on controlling the internal structure, and it can be said that the desired goal has been achieved. It is expected that a non-partisan, legitimate, and strong policy will be gradually adopted in the future. This decisive move is unprecedented in the history of army reshuffles, and even the future is beyond imagination. (Dispatch from the News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Japanese Army Reshuffle: Control Faction Triumphs Over the Araki Faction</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The details of the army reshuffle are as follows: Because of the great decisiveness in replacing the Director-General of Education, expectations were initially too high, so there is a general sense of dissatisfaction. General Hishikari's tenure expires in November, so it is a natural order for him to be a general-class officer awaiting orders. General Matsui was removed because he organized the Greater East Asia Association within the army department and, like General Masaki, was against the army's control. The decision to put Lieutenant General Hata, commander of the Second Division, on standby was due to differences of opinion between Minister of the Army Hayashi and Director-General Masaki, and Minister of the Army Hayashi's bold execution of this reshuffle is meaningful. Lieutenant General Umezu, who succeeded Lieutenant General Hata, did not make sacrifices but achieved results in the North China Incident, so there are high expectations for his future. Colonel Ishiwara, who had performed meritorious service in the Manchurian Incident and had been in Sendai after returning home, was transferred to the General Staff Headquarters, and Colonel Ishimoto, a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, was transferred to the head of the research section. Both of these transfers are intended to lay the foundation for building a new army. This reshuffle, with the decisive replacement of the Director-General of Education, failed to continue, so there is still some courtesy towards a certain segment, so the voices of success and dissatisfaction are evenly split. (Dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The following internal orders have been issued for the major army reshuffle: Kagesa Sadaki, assistant military attaché at the Embassy of the Republic of China, is appointed as head of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry; Oki Yoshiki, staff officer of the China Garrison Army, is appointed as military attaché at the Embassy of the Republic of China; Inukata Isao, attached to the Ordnance Headquarters, is appointed to the General Staff Headquarters for Chinese affairs. (Dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>The Nagoya Newspaper reported on the 17th that the army usually schedules personnel changes for August each year. On the afternoon of the 16th, Minister of the Army Hayashi suddenly forced Education Director-General Masaki to resign, and future changes within the ministry are noteworthy. It is noted that General Masaki has been a leading figure in the hardline faction within the army since the Manchurian Incident, and he is a representative of the anti-Ugaki faction (Masaki was dismissed by Ugaki before and has not forgotten the resentment). After Showa 6 (1931), he and former Minister of the Army Araki worked together within the army ministry to eliminate the power of the Ugaki faction. This was the golden age of the Masaki-Araki clique. In Showa 8 (1933), Masaki was promoted to general and appointed as Director-General of Education. When Araki was Minister of the Army, Masaki vigorously expanded his power, and key positions within the ministry were filled with his cronies, leading to increasing chaos in the ministry's control. Hayashi took office as Minister of the Army under these circumstances and repeatedly sought to control the ministry. Therefore, since taking office, there have been three or four regular army personnel changes, already revealing the intention of reorganization. However, Masaki, as one of the three top officers of the army (the three top officers are the Director-General of Education, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Minister of the Army, who jointly control the great power of the Japanese army), still supported the strengthening of his own faction's power, leading to actions by the Masaki faction that repeatedly contradicted Minister of the Army Hayashi. In particular, regarding the Manchurian organization issue, the 500,000-yen Diet issue, and the Emperor Organ Theory issue, rumors spread that they were contacting outside parties to instigate various restraints on Minister of the Army Hayashi within the ministry. Therefore, Minister of the Army Hayashi had no choice but to make a decisive resolution during the August changes this year to thoroughly rectify the ministry. Thus, at the meeting of the three top officers on the 12th, he presented the list of personnel changes, which was opposed by Masaki. The opinions of the two sides clashed fiercely. The meeting was adjourned on that day. On the 15th, another meeting of the three top officers was held. Minister of the Army Hayashi and Education Director-General Masaki's opinions remained opposed, but Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in supported Minister of the Army Hayashi's opinion. Seeing that the situation was lost, Masaki had no choice but to offer his resignation. After the content of the three top officers' meeting on the 12th was revealed, the Masaki faction immediately held meetings everywhere and took demonstrative actions. General Hishikari and former Minister of the Army Araki visited Minister of the Army Hayashi to try to ease the situation, but Hayashi insisted on his views in order to control the ministry. At the second meeting of the three top officers on the 15th, a direct conflict occurred. Masaki angrily walked out of the meeting, and Minister of the Army Hayashi immediately sought the opinions of Araki Sadao of the Ugaki faction and Abe Nobuyuki regarding the successor to the Director-General of Education. Later, it was decided to appoint Watanabe Jotaro, who had a slightly milder color. At the same time, the leaders of the Masaki faction within the ministry were also decided to be changed, it was said.</p>
<p>Also, the Nagoya Newspaper reported on the 18th that the sudden replacement of Education Director-General Masaki due to the August regular personnel changes has caused a great shock in all aspects. However, those who had previously questioned Minister of the Army Hayashi's personnel administration have now been swept away, and Minister of the Army Hayashi's advance or retreat has also attracted attention from all parties. Originally, Minister of the Army Hayashi was largely seen as a member of the Ugaki faction, but when the Minister of the Army remained in office, he took a completely non-partisan position, standing alone in isolation. Now, Minister of the Army Hayashi, with the goal of controlling the ministry, has gained the support of a segment of the ministry and, with Minister of the Army Hayashi at the center, has formed a central faction force and is actively working to strengthen the central ministry in conjunction with the control faction that also advocates controlling the ministry. It is believed that this problem is greatly related to the problem of Minister of the Army Hayashi's resignation last year. This time, the upper-level officers were changed, and it was originally intended to transfer Lieutenant General Hata Shunji, the commander of the military police, away from his base and transfer him to commander of the Second Division, and to appoint Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke as commander of the First Division. The vacancy left behind would be filled by Hashimoto Toranosuke, in the hope that control could be strengthened. In short, this army reshuffle is a direct conflict with Araki and Masaki, the central figures of the Kodoha faction. On one side, the central faction, formed by Minister of the Army Hayashi with Vice Minister Hashimoto as its center, has gained the support of those who have been neutral and uncolored, so it can be seen as a control faction, such as Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, commander of the Fifth Division; Lieutenant General Takekawa, commander of the Tenth Division; Major General Nagata Tetsuzan, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau; Major General Itagaki, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army; and Colonel Hashimoto, attached to the Kwantung Army. The center of work is arranged by Major General Nagata, while the Kodoha faction (i.e., the former cadre faction) that opposes this central faction includes former Minister of the Army Araki Sadao and Generals Kawashima, Hata, Yanagawa, and Honjo, centered around General Masaki; and direct line figures such as Colonel Honma, commander of the First Infantry Regiment, as well as Major General Okamura (Director of the Second Department of the General Staff), Lieutenant General Umezu (Commander of the North China Garrison Army), Major General Shigetou (Commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade), Major General Mochinaga (Commander of the Korean Military Police), Colonel Suzuki (Cabinet Investigator), Colonel Houmoto (Head of the Army Ministry Press Section), and Colonel Ishiwara (Commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment), etc., are powerful and form an opposing force. This time, Masaki's resignation as Director-General of Education is a sign of the decline of the Kodoha faction, and it is also a trend of the rise of the central faction (i.e., the control faction). Strictly speaking, it is a manifestation of the revival of the Ugaki faction, since General Watanabe (the new Director-General of Education), General Matsui (Military Councilor), Lieutenant General Sugiyama (Vice Chief of Staff), Lieutenant General Koiso, and Major General Nagata are all sympathizers of the Ugaki faction. However, Colonel Hashimoto, who was formerly regarded as a member of General Masaki's faction, and Lieutenant General Takekawa and Major General Itagaki, who were regarded as members of the Hata faction, have also turned to the control faction, supporting Minister of the Army Hayashi and assisting in unifying and strengthening the central ministry. This is a manifestation of the dissolution of the conflicts between the factions. The most noteworthy thing is the current position of the army, which can be seen from the North China issue. At the moment, we are at a critical period for work towards China and Russia, and strengthening and refreshing the internal lineup is an urgent task.</p>
<p>Also, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 18th that since Masaki resigned, the morale within the ministry has changed, and dark clouds are drifting, and optimism is not permitted. Even some people who sympathized with General Masaki regarded the change of the Director-General of Education as unprecedented, so the issue of Hayashi's advance or retreat has also arisen, and it is said that this regular change of the upper-level department of the army ministry is entirely a measure of private factional feelings, and the control of the army has exposed destruction, so thinking for the national army, they have no choice but to fight against Hayashi, and this kind of atmosphere has been reflected in the leadership and middle class, and if they want to break through this difficult situation, it depends entirely on the abilities of the new Director-General of Education to determine the development of the situation, but Minister of the Army Hayashi proposed to resign last year because he knew he was not safe in his position due to the problem of his younger brother Shirakami Yu, and this time the change of senior officers, the Masaki faction will inevitably bring up old matters as an excuse to overthrow Hayashi, it is said.</p>

<h3>Outer Mongolian Authorities Reject Japanese Demands, Saying They Violate Sovereignty and Independence</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to dispatches from Kulun, the puppet government has requested Outer Mongolia to accept their demands, namely, to allow the puppet government and the Kwantung Army Headquarters to send representatives to be permanently stationed in Outer Mongolian territory, and to allow them to build their own telegraph lines in Outer Mongolian territory to connect with Manchuria for communication. These demands violate Outer Mongolia's sovereignty and independence and were rejected by the Mongolian side on July 3rd. On July 17th, a Japanese representative from the puppet government's external affairs department also delivered a written statement to Sambu, the chairman of the Mongolian delegation in Manzhouli, stating the puppet government's proposal that Outer Mongolia should exchange permanent and empowered representatives with the puppet government to replace the past unilateral approach. Subsequently, the Kulun side received a letter from the Kwantung Army representative in Manzhouli, signed on July 10th, reiterating the lie that they arrested Japanese topographic surveyors within Manzhouli territory on June 23rd, and put forward three demands from the puppet government: "Our authorities consider it particularly important that all Mongolian troops withdraw from Tashikbulak and the eastern border. These demands are the minimum required to resolve the problem. The Japanese army will take decisive action," it said. The Outer Mongolian side pointed out that the letter has once again exposed the plan of the Japanese warlords stationed in Manchuria, which is to provoke conflict and, under any circumstances, try to use the conflicts they have created themselves as an excuse to seize Mongolian territory.

<h3>British First Lord of the Admiralty Announces Abandonment of the Ratio System; Japan Responds</h3>
<p>(London) British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell stated in the House of Commons today that although the international system of naval restrictions or naval proportionalism has prevented war in the past, it must be recognized as a failure and abandoned today. Lloyd George also criticized the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in the House of Commons today, saying that the agreement has allowed Germany to wage submarine warfare and has allowed Germany to increase this type of weapon. (Guomin News Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, speakers from all parties criticized the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Labour MP Hall said that the government first accused Germany of violating the armament clauses in the Treaty of Versailles and then suddenly concluded an agreement with Germany to increase its naval power, which is self-contradictory. Liberal MP Admiral Campbell said that the agreement gives Germany a new navy, while British warships will gradually become obsolete. Lloyd George said that the government has not only tolerated the number of submarines Germany has but has allowed it to build more. This kind of "negligence" is regrettable. First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell replied that the ratio of major naval powers is about to be abandoned because several countries believe that accepting coercion harms their national prestige. The principle of the British government's current actions is to request all countries to report the navy they wish to have in 1942. The First Lord of the Admiralty then refuted the blame for Britain's unilateral actions, saying that multilateralism has already allowed Germany's army to increase from 300,000 to 550,000, and its air force is the same, so we cannot allow its navy to be the same (loud cheers from the cabinet seats). The abolition of submarines is the first priority of British naval policy. Britain welcomes Germany's cooperation and hopes to have a better chance of success in the disarmament conference. (Reuters Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has stated its views on British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell's declaration to abolish the ratio system. The Japanese government recognizes that the reason why the British government recognizes that the ratio system should not be used as a method of arms reduction is an understanding of Japan's reasonable claims. Since Britain has understood this, the United States will not be so stubborn in adhering to the ratio system. It is still a question whether the method of arms reduction after the abolition of the ratio system will adopt an autonomous declaration of shipbuilding. It is feared that it will not be successful without sufficient consideration, it is said. (Jiji Press Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell's declaration in the House of Commons on the 22nd to abandon the naval ratio system has aroused attention in all aspects. The Japanese Navy Ministry's opinion on this issue is roughly as follows: Based on the Anglo-German talks, Britain will gradually resolve the fundamental naval problem. Although Britain has abandoned the ratio system, Japan cannot agree if its specific plan lacks substance. (Jiji Press Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Military Expenses Enormous and Funds Needed Urgently; Italian Government Abolishes Gold Standard; National Bank Abandons 40% Reserve: First Blow in the War Preparations Against Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government gazette published an order today, relieving the Italian National Bank of the responsibility of having a 40% cash reserve for the banknotes it issues. However, this move does not mean that Italy has already abandoned the gold standard. The order takes effect immediately after its promulgation. The wording is as follows: "The government, being in urgent need of finding ways to pay special funds abroad, has temporarily abolished the first section of the fourth item of the decree of December 21, 1917, which orders the Italian National Bank to always maintain a cash reserve of at least 40% for the banknotes it issues." The aforementioned decree became law on June 7, 1928. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government's announcement today to abolish the provision of a 40% gold reserve for national banknotes is highly regarded, as it is completely contrary to the Italian government's previous policy of maintaining the price of the Italian currency. The Italian government's move seems to indicate that the situation between Italy and Abyssinia is extremely serious, as it intends to proceed to the end regardless of the cost. However, Italy has now abolished the gold standard. Since 1927, the Italian Ministry of Finance has strived to support and preserve the law of a 40% gold reserve, but this only applies internally. As for foreign countries, the export of currency is strictly controlled, and in reality, the gold standard has long been abandoned. After the stock exchange closed last night, the Political Affairs Council held another secret meeting and decided to abolish the gold reserve law. This is the first financial blow Italy has suffered since its war preparations against Abyssinia, as Italy is actively purchasing war equipment overseas, and the gold in the national treasury is flowing out continuously. Italy recently planned to raise private loans overseas, but it was ineffective. Now, seeing that there are many remittances waiting to be resolved, it has suspended the banknote reserve to obtain 93 million pounds for foreign remittances. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(New York) The Financial Observer believes today that Italy's reduction of the cash reserve for banknotes is a prelude to inflation, which will be difficult to control, as in the case of Germany in the past. Although Italy is not yet comparable to post-war Germany, financial experts predict that Italy's finances will deteriorate due to the costly expedition to East Africa. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Italy's temporary suspension of the gold standard is not considered surprising here, as the stock exchange had already anticipated this. According to financial circles, there are two reasons for Italy's action: (1) Italy has no funds to pay for military expenses; (2) It is unable to obtain loans from abroad. According to the Daily Telegraph, Italy recently purchased a large number of American trucks, and the other party insisted on paying cash, so it had to pay with silver bars. It is expected here that the Italian currency will plummet afterward, and travel expenses to Italy will become more expensive. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government explained the temporary suspension of the gold reserve law, saying that it is not to lower the value of the currency. The Italian government intends to restore the gold reserve as soon as possible. The foreign lending agency management and the commercial exchange bureau intend to use a ratio system to enable the government to immediately take measures to protect the Italian currency when it is attacked.

<h3>Britain and France Reach Consensus; League of Nations to Meet Mid-Next Week; Invoking Article Fifteen of the Covenant</h3>
<p>(Paris) The British and French governments have reached an agreement on the League of Nations Council meeting in the middle of next week. The exact date will be determined by the Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that Britain and France have agreed that when the League of Nations Council meets to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it should be handled in accordance with Article Fifteen of the League of Nations Covenant. The British Ambassador to Paris met with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval again today to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The official arena is now unwilling to make statements lightly, so no comments are made on the meeting between the two officials. It is believed that the British and French governments are now doing their best to find ways to eliminate the Italo-Abyssinian war. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, has arrived here today, and this trip is considered very important. Rumor has it that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov may come here to participate in the discussion. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) At 7:00 PM today, British Ambassador Sir Clerk visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval to discuss the Abyssinian issue. The British Cabinet held a meeting on this matter this morning. After the meeting, instructions were sent to Sir Clerk, ordering him to meet with Laval. It is generally believed that France agrees that the League of Nations Council should meet at the beginning of next month. At that time, the Council will not only appoint a fifth arbitrator from a neutral country, but may also study the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in its entirety in accordance with Article Fifteen of the Covenant. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) With the date of the League of Nations Council meeting on July 25th approaching, all parties related to the League of Nations are now speculating on the future trend of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. It is believed that Britain's attitude will determine the League of Nations' policy. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov is currently in Italy and will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini soon to discuss the procedures to be taken by the League of Nations. The Abyssinian government's request to invoke Article Fifteen of the League of Nations Covenant has so far been considered possible to implement slowly, but the Abyssinian petition cannot be ignored for long. The main points of Article Fifteen of the League of Nations Covenant are that the Council should do its best to mediate the dispute between the two countries. If it cannot be resolved, the Council, through a vote of all or a majority of its members, should issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Council considers fair and appropriate. If the Council's report is unanimously approved by the members, then neither of the conflicting parties may engage in war against any party that complies with the recommendations of the report. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain's Tough Stance; Will Stand Upright in Geneva</h3>
<p>(London) France's hope of taking the same steps as Britain in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is gaining strength. If Italy and Abyssinia fail to negotiate a settlement, and the League of Nations Council allows war to break out in East Africa, France will see the European treaty system fall into danger. This is what British cabinet members deeply believe. At the same time, Britain's attitude has crystallized into a view that if all opportunities for collective action disappear, Britain must stand up in Geneva to deal with the broader events, and refuse to limit the Council's discussion to the Walwal incident. It should also publicly declare that if other countries are willing to do what Britain does, Britain is prepared to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. It is now believed that the Cabinet has decided not to prohibit the shipment of arms to Italy or Abyssinia, as no other government is currently taking steps to manage the shipment of arms to these two countries. However, applications for export passports for arms related to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute have been put on hold for consideration. Foreign Secretary Hoare will make an announcement on the issue in the House of Commons today. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Several members of parliament from various parties held a banquet somewhere this evening. The purpose of this banquet was to allow Abyssinian Minister Martin to state Abyssinia's position on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The chairman, Labor MP Davis, declared the other day that the League of Nations would face its final test. Martin then detailed Abyssinia's progress in recent years, and especially emphasized the advocacy of justice and the trend towards abolition of slavery. The root cause of the dispute is Italy's desire to annex Abyssinia, while falsely claiming to civilize it. Former Egyptian Ambassador to Britain, Moharran, expressed sympathy for Abyssinia and thanked Britain for its efforts to eliminate the war. Former Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament, Rifat, also addressed the audience in the same vein. When Martin met with Reuters interviewers afterward, he said that he had contacted private parties and planned to raise a loan of 2 million British pounds in Britain or the United States for Abyssinia's development. He recently received hundreds of letters from people offering to serve in Abyssinia's war, and some people did not want to be paid. Many of the letter writers were Irish, which is truly strange. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) After the Cabinet held a special meeting today, according to reliable sources, the government is very afraid that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's colonial ambitions will extend beyond Abyssinia and lead to a direct conflict with Britain's interests in Africa. Therefore, Foreign Secretary Hoare urged his colleagues to find ways to localize the Italo-Abyssinian dispute through the League of Nations. Eden, the Minister for League of Nations Affairs, did not think well of Hoare's suggestion, saying that if the League of Nations intends to take such action, its credibility will be completely undermined.

<h3>U.S. Decides to Maintain Embassy; Regardless of Developments in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department stated today that regardless of developments in Abyssinia, the United States intends to maintain its embassy in the Abyssinian capital. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain and Italy Warn Clergy; To Concentrate Near the Abyssinian Capital</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has today warned the church authorities that British clergy stationed in Abyssinia must concentrate near the Abyssinian capital. It is heard that there are more than 100 British clergy stationed in Abyssinia, including their families. The largest church in Abyssinia is the Sudan Interior Mission, whose staff is mostly American and Canadian. In addition, the Bible Society has 15 clergy and the Church of England has 2 clergy stationed in Abyssinia. There are also 7 synagogues, whose clergy are mostly Swiss or German. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to observers here, if the fundamental work of peaceful negotiations cannot begin, an Italo-Abyssinian war will be difficult to avoid this week. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Increases Security at Japanese Embassy; Anti-Japanese Movements Occur in Various Places</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reports in the local newspapers, anti-Japanese demonstrations took place in Milan, Genoa, and Bologna today. Speakers condemned Japan's attitude towards Abyssinia. The Postal Newspaper published an editorial today, criticizing Japan's hypocrisy and untrustworthiness, and asked the question, "Why can't Japan ignore the Abyssinian issue?" (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The authorities here have increased guards in front of the Japanese Embassy to prevent anti-Japanese demonstrations, because after Japan expressed its position on Abyssinia, newspaper editorials unanimously criticized Japan, and popular anti-Japanese demonstrations are inevitable. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied that its Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura, had the authority to assure Italy that Japan would adopt a policy of non-interference in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Italian newspapers today launched a fierce attack on Japan. The Italian People's Daily stated that the Italian government should no longer believe any statements made by Japanese envoys, and said that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was solely for the purpose of being able to act freely when invading China. The newspaper also pointed out that Japan intended to carry out economic aggression in Africa and planned to conclude a military alliance, and even believed that Britain and the League of Nations could prevent Italy's plans in Africa. Therefore, Italy is now facing not only the threat from Abyssinia, but also Japan's huge expansion plan. The New News editorial also stated that Japan intends to increase its very small position in Africa and promote its commercial and political power, but it does not know that Africa is adjacent to Italy, and it may not be the time for Japan to expand within Italy's sphere of influence. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) A semi-official source here stated that Japanese Ambassador Matsumura told a reporter from the Forum Newspaper that he still insisted on the points he made in his recent conversation with Mussolini. In his capacity as ambassador, he guaranteed that his conversation was completely consistent with the views of the Japanese government, that is, Japan has no vested interests in Abyssinia. The Japanese Ambassador continued that Japan naturally has commercial interests in Abyssinia, but no political interest. Regarding these commercial interests, Japan plans to establish an embassy in the Abyssinian capital at the end of December this year. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official "Italian Daily" published a commentary stating, "Japan, on the one hand, invades the Asian continent and India, endangering Britain's main interests, and on the other hand, enters the African continent through the Red Sea, plotting a major economic offensive against European countries. Britain should be very aware of Japan's ambition. Therefore, Italy's East African policy is not only to deal with the threat from Abyssinia, but also to prevent Japan's aggressive ambitions. If we want to seek mutual ties between European countries, it is first necessary to have close ties in Africa. The rationale is all the more clear." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota explained the Japanese government's beliefs regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute to Italian Ambassador to Japan Oretti on the 16th of this month. However, the Italian side still believes that Ambassador Sugimura's explanation in Italy is inconsistent with the government's policy, and is propagating anti-Japanese sentiment, and even reporting the prevalence of slandering Japan. On the one hand, it is eager for Japan's ambassadors in Afghanistan, Iran, etc. to successively request the official announcement of Japan's future policy. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota issued instructions to the foreign envoys on the 23rd to convey Japan's clear policy in order to eliminate the misunderstanding, and regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, he instructed them to pay attention and not to be used by other countries. This is what is hoped. (Japanese United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Hosts Foreign Guests; German and Italian Envoys Refuse to Participate</h3>
<p>(Abyssinia) Today is the Abyssinian King's birthday. The Abyssinian government held a reception and a large banquet to celebrate. Italian Envoy Count Giglio Yassi refused to participate, saying that the Abyssinian King had recently made an anti-Italian speech. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Abyssinia) The Abyssinian Emperor met with envoys from various countries today, but the Italian envoy refused to attend. No other members of the Italian embassy were present. This public break between Italy and Abyssinia is unprecedented since the Italo-Abyssinian dispute began. The Abyssinian authorities consider Italy's attitude to be an expression of open provocation. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>London Pays Attention to Gold Group Panic; Dutch Currency System to Cause Political Storm</h3>
<p>(London) The panic of the gold group has once again attracted the attention of Londoners, but the focus of attention is not the Italian currency but the Dutch currency, because Italy's adherence to the gold standard has long been an act of idealism exceeding reality. Therefore, the government's announcement to reduce the gold reserve has not had much impact. Today's London Lille list price is 63.75, yesterday it was 60.12. The exchange rate from Paris to Rome is 118.00 francs per hundred lire, yesterday's price was 124.75 francs. London has long been pessimistic about Italy's finances, and has become even more fearful since the Abyssinian dispute developed. The Dutch Parliament will vote on an economic bill today, and the market is very concerned about the outcome of the vote, because if it is rejected, it will cause a political storm. The fate of the bill depends on the actions of the Roman Catholic Party. If the government is defeated, there will be new attacks on the Dutch guilder. This is the reason why the spot and forward prices of the Dutch guilder have been weak in recent months. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of German Debt; Approximately 60 Billion Marks Not Officially Announced</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Intellectual Weekly published a special article today, revealing that there are approximately 60 billion marks in national debt that are not included in official statistics. It is generally believed that this article was authorized by Economics Minister and President of the German National Bank Schacht, so foreigners have paid close attention to it. The article claimed that the national debt increased by a huge amount of 11 billion marks in the three months from the end of March to the end of June. Therefore, it requested the government to quickly implement a reduction in government spending plan, and also said that Germany's short-term national debt today is actually 80 billion marks, so the total amount of national debt is actually 180 billion marks. The government's announcement in the past that it was only 124 billion marks is just a formality. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Yuan Shu's Case of Endangering the Republic of China; Hubei High Court Has Ruled</h3>

<p>(Hankou) Yuan Shu (i.e., Yuan Xueyi), who had close relations with the strange foreigners in Shanghai, was arrested and sent to Hubei, where he was interrogated by the court.

The Customs Administration believed that the immediate abolition might affect tax revenue, and suggested universally reducing expenses to maintain the original system. The Ministry of Finance considered that the submitted report was still insightful, and since the transit tax had not yet been implemented and abolished, it approved the request. It has now reduced the expenses of the Customs Superintendencies separately and notified them, which will be implemented from July. (Special Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>Inspection Report on River Disasters by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya From Shanghai to Hankou (Part 1)</p>
<p>"Recently, due to continuous rain and rising river levels, many embankments along the rivers have collapsed, causing floods in dozens of counties in the river basins. Although the weather has cleared up in recent days and the water level has slightly decreased, the affected people are all crying out for food. Moreover, the autumn flood season is approaching, so flood prevention work must be stepped up. Therefore, this newspaper has dispatched a special correspondent to inspect the disaster situation along the rivers and report it to the public to help with rescue and disaster prevention. Recalling the great flood of 1931, followed by the September 18th Incident in the same year, at this time of severe national crisis, we are again facing a devastating flood. I don't know how the people of the country should work hard in a timely manner to reach the shore of 'saving oneself by saving others.'"</p>
<p>At 2 a.m. on the 16th, I boarded a boat in Shanghai to go up the Yangtze River. At that time, the drizzle had just stopped, and the clouds and mist were opening. The lights on both sides of the Huangpu River were dim, almost like fireflies. However, the sultry weather felt no different from that in a painting. At dawn, we entered the main stream of the Yangtze River. The river water was vast and surging, rushing into the sea. The speed of the boat was slower than usual. After passing Jiangyin, because Huangshan, Xiaoshishan, and Ebi Nose Mountain were close to the riverbank, the water flow suddenly narrowed and became more rapid, making the boat's progress even slower. This was not because the boat owner was strictly complying with the order to limit speed to prevent damaging the embankments, but because the current was so strong that it was difficult to push the boat forward. According to a passenger from Tongzhou, the water level in the inner lake of that area was so shallow that it was impossible to moor a boat. In 1931, it was a vast expanse of water, which shows that the downstream area has not yet shown significant signs of disaster. The situation was also good when we passed Zhenjiang at night.</p>
<p>The lower level of the boat was mostly filled with poor refugees. The sound of people without tickets kneeling and begging the ticket collectors was unbearable to hear. If they searched their bodies and found nothing, the ticket collectors were happy to find gold in the sand if they found a few pawn tickets. Otherwise, they would insult, scold, slap, or strip the ticketless people. If they encountered women like the "nanny" or "older sister" type from Shanghai, the brutal elements, that is the people in the accounting room and the tea room would even use canes or branches to strike their chests, which was excessive in the extreme. Among the people without tickets were also refugees sent by the Shanghai Xinwei Relief Association and various charitable organizations, each with a blue symbol printed on their arms as proof. It is said that initially, tickets were issued, but later, due to the discovery of resale abuses, the symbol was changed to be printed on the arm. A certain number are sent each time, and the sending organization pays the shipping company according to the standard of two yuan per person reaching Hankou and one and a half yuan per person not reaching Hankou, which the ship then distributes to the refugees. (It is said that over 30,000 yuan has been paid out from the start of sending in March until now.) Therefore, these refugees still have food to eat, but they must take their turn to fetch the food with their own utensils. Give more to those who need more, and less to those who need less. Do not argue, or the food will be taken back and the utensil thrown into the river to show punishment. Alas, these refugees are all farmers, also our compatriots, but only because of rural bankruptcy, they ran into the city, and because this path was blocked, they are now being driven back to the countryside, constantly wandering and unable to drink all the bitter wine bestowed upon them by modern society and enduring the cruel treatment of another level of human society. It is lamentable. The next day, the boat arrived at Xiaguan in Nanjing. Here, the river water was only a foot or so away from the bank, and the bank was four or five feet high. Except for the low-lying areas in the west and across the river in Pukou, which were slightly flooded, the rest was fine. At 8 p.m., we arrived in Wuhu. It happened to be that the river water had risen three inches greatly. Changjietou, Jieganting, Linjiantan, and the area along the pier all had water, and the grass houses inhabited by civilians in Linjiantan were all washed away, with losses of about 2,000 yuan. In addition, there were over 300,000 mu of weitian, mostly bordering the rivers. On the 24th of last month, the Tiancheng Lake and Ouyang Lake embankments collapsed one after another due to disputes and a lack of repair, inundating 4,000 to 5,000 mu of fields. On the 2nd of this month, Chairman Liu Zhenhua of Anhui Province inspected the embankments along the river and came to Wuhu to guide flood prevention. Today (the 17th), to welcome Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, he came to Wuhu again to board the ship and accompany Xu westward. I took the opportunity to visit and learned the following: "Since the disaster signs became apparent in Anhui Province, the provincial government has fully mobilized and gone to various places to investigate the situation and guide disaster prevention work. Although the 'avoid' in 'avoiding disaster' has not been achieved, the 'reduce' in 'reducing disaster' has been achieved. This year's (1935) administrative plan has decided to focus on the words 'guard' and 'nurture.' 'Guard' refers to maintaining local security and order, especially paying attention to eliminating hidden dangers in non-bandit areas. 'Nurture' refers to revitalizing water conservancy, which is especially closely related to rural production and economy. I have visited the countryside and seen that the assets lost by farmers are nothing more than a few acres of poor land, one or two rooms of housing, and one or two head of cattle and pigs. If we can find a way to eliminate water, drought, and banditry and protect these things from harm, that will be enough. There is no need to aim high and seek recovery strategies from Europe and the United States." Liu also said, "China is so poor and weak because of the upside-down political priorities. There is only urban political entertainment, bureaucratic hypocrisy, and no practical rural politics. This results in more developed cities, more hypocritical government offices, and the consequences are more bankrupt countryside and weaker nation." This evening's conversation can be said to be on point. However, to revitalize the rural economy and restore the nation and the people, it seems that the resistance to external economic aggression, the clarification of internal official corruption, and the reduction of the people's burdens cannot be neglected.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, we arrived in Anqing. The water had risen to the shore. The main roads along the river at Dananmen and Xiaonanmen were waist-deep in water. Residents built wooden bridges along the walls to connect to their houses. Rickshaws explored the water. Children used wooden basins as boats to play and float. If it was a riverside hotel, they would post a sign saying "There is a dry road in the back that leads to the city" to attract customers. The accumulated water had not receded on the East Main Street. Because it was a place where merchants gathered, wooden boards were erected, which was very stable. There was a pagoda on the street, 24 zhang high, with seven levels. From the top of the pagoda, one could see the entire city. The houses in the south outside the city, because they were near the river and the terrain was low, were all half-submerged in the water. The river water flowed eastward, the water surface was wide, and the mist and waves were vast, looking like an ocean. From mid-June to early July, the amount of rainfall in various counties in the Yangtze River basin of Anhui Province ranged from over 240 mm to over 540 mm. Due to repeated torrential rains, the mountain floods were great, and the inner river and lake embankments were strained. At the same time, the upstream water poured down, causing the river water to rise daily. For example, the water level in Anqing was still 31 feet on June 20th, but by June 31st, it was nearly 38 feet. On July 4th, it was even 40 feet 2 inches, exceeding the flood level of 1933 by 3 inches. The rise slowed slightly afterwards, and on the 13th, it was 40 feet 7 inches, only a little over 2 feet away from the 1931 water level. Although over 30 levees in counties along the river have collapsed, most were small levees and newly constructed beach areas. In the future, if there are no heavy rains and they are not affected by the rapid downstream surge from upstream, then under the unified strict prevention of the government and the people, the major levees will not be in danger.</p>
<p>In mid-July, the Anhui provincial government, in view of the prolonged lack of rain and the signs of drought in various counties, feared that the drought of last year would unfortunately recur this year. A set of emergency drought relief measures was specifically drawn up and ordered to be followed by various counties. One of the measures also "ordered the people to plant drought-resistant crops early in high-lying areas that are expected to be difficult to irrigate." However, as soon as this order was issued, before it could take effect, the people went from worrying about drought to suffering from rain. Most recently, they are in a state of anxiety and are engaged in flood prevention and drainage day and night. In just half a month, they were first ordered to prevent drought, and suddenly they were told to prevent floods. If the people continue to be tossed between the two disasters of water and drought, there will surely be no survivors. However, this kind of treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts is not only the case in one province and one area along the river, but also in the Yellow River, Pearl River, and other river basins. Preventing and managing floods in advance is better than providing piecemeal relief in times of emergency. Those who control nature are fit to survive, and those who are subservient to nature will be eliminated. This is an immutable principle. I wonder if the people of the country are interested in this?</p>

<h3>Henan Province's Rivers Swell, Flooding Over Twenty Counties</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Awaiting Relief, Crying Out in Hunger</p>
<p>A dispatch from Kaifeng states that since the beginning of this month, heavy rains have fallen in various parts of the province. The Yellow River has overflowed, inundating Lanfeng, Chenliu, Fengqiu, and Hua County. The Yi and Luo rivers have collapsed, causing disasters in Gong County and Yanshi, with Yanshi being particularly severe. According to a report submitted by the county a few days ago, 67 corpses with names and 158 corpses without names have been found. Among the 1,364 households in the city, 157 households are missing. Assuming 8 people per household, the number of deaths and missing is over 1,500. 18,120 houses in the city have collapsed. There are currently over 10,000 disaster victims in the city, plus those affected in the countryside, totaling over 80,000 people. The Provincial Relief Association sent personnel a few days ago with 1,000 yuan in emergency relief to the disaster victims in the city, with 20 cents for each adult and 10 cents for each child. As a result, half of the disaster victims did not receive the relief, and the funds were exhausted. The Hong, Sha, Luo, and Bo rivers have overflowed, turning Suiping, Xiping, Yancheng, Xihua, and Shangshui into wetlands. The Bai River has collapsed, causing major disasters in Nanyang and Xinye. The Dan and Xi rivers have swelled, overwhelming mountains and hills. From Jingziguan in Xichuan County to Liguanqiao, extending for over 200 li, is a vast expanse of water. The strong climb mountains in the rain, while the old and weak are left to the flood. Dozens of villages, including Bailang, Yangxi, Taohe, Yujiaying, Wangying, Songwan, Zhangzhuang, Shuanghezhen, Lilou, and Chenying, have been almost completely washed away. The Zhang River breached at Zhuanzhaiying in Linzhang, at the border of Linzhang, Anyang, and Neihuang. Over 30 villages, including Niuxinzhuang, Shixinzhuang, Wuxinzhuang, Maxinzhuang, Songxinzhuang, Guoxinzhuang, Mengxinzhuang, Douguanying, Qianhuanqiao, Houhuanqiao, Longwangmiao, Jinqiaozhuang, Qiaojiazhuang, Liquanzhuang, Zhangjiazhuang, Wangjiayuan, and Xiaoweijiaying, and Lijaying, have suffered major disasters. The Wei River has overflowed, causing disaster in Jun County. Other affected areas, such as Xiangyu, Song County, and Zhenping County, are all surrounded by water. The disaster area is very large. Although the Water Rescue Association has been established and Chang Zhizhen has been appointed as the head of the General Affairs Group, Wang Xingzhou as the head of the Solicitation Group, Zhang Jingyu as the head of the Work Relief Group, Yin Renxian as the head of the Relief Distribution Group, Wang Zunwu as the head of the Shelter Group, Fang Qidao as the head of the Purchase Group, Shangguan Wuchen as the head of the Hygiene Group, and Li Hanzhen as the head of the Accounting Group, however, in this period of economic depression, fundraising is difficult, and relief from the government is still needed.

<h3>Mrs. Lin Jing's Statement on the Matter</h3>
<p>Denying Her Husband Has Formed a New Relationship in America; Has Telegraphed Chairman Lin Requesting Him to Intervene</p>
<p>(North China News Agency) A dispatch from America reports that Lin Jing, the son of Chairman Lin of the National Government, recently became engaged to a Miss White in the United States. This has attracted considerable attention from faculty and students at both Fu Jen and Yenching Universities, as Lin Jing had previously studied at these two institutions. It has been less than a year since Lin went abroad. Currently, his second wife still resides here. The news of Lin forming a new relationship abroad has led to a flurry of visits to the Lin residence in Bensihutong in the Eastern District for the past two days (the 19th and 20th), as relatives and friends have been arriving to offer condolences or inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 19th), this reporter was the first to visit to offer condolences. At the time, Mrs. Lin was selecting fruits and vegetables at the entrance to relieve the summer heat. The reporter initially hesitated to reveal his purpose and cautiously inquired about Lin's residence, unsure if he was at the correct address. After getting out of the car, the reporter asked, "Is Mr. Lin Jing at home?" Mrs. Lin, surprised, retorted, "What do you want with him?" At that moment, the reporter confirmed that it was indeed the Lin residence and explained his purpose. Mrs. Lin nodded and said, "You've come about his issue. I appreciate your kindness." She then invited the reporter into the living room. The story of Mrs. Lin Jing is a rich and colorful one. When Lin Jing was studying at Huiwen in Beiping, he married Miss Yin Yan, the sister of a prominent businessman named Chen. Later, he lived with Yin Yan's younger sister, Shao Hua. The two women got along very well. After Lin Jing graduated from Fu Jen University a few years ago, he transferred to the Economics Department of the Yenching University Graduate School. He left Beiping in June of last year and sailed from Shanghai in August. His wife, Chen Yin Yan, accompanied him to Shanghai. After Lin went abroad, she returned to her native Fujian province. His second wife, Chen Shao Hua, stayed in Beiping to recuperate from her weak health, due to bearing three children over several years, and also to tutor her children, making her a virtuous wife and good mother of her time. Upon entering the living room, the reporter noticed her eldest son, Ping, practicing calligraphy, her daughter, Na, learning to recognize characters, and her second son, Liang, being held by a wet nurse, who cried at the sight of a guest. Mrs. Lin quickly ordered her to take him away. She then turned to the reporter and said, "If you have any questions, I can answer them one by one." The reporter asked, "What is your opinion on the news that Mr. Lin is engaged to a Miss White in America?" She replied, "Whether my husband's actions in America are as reported by the American dispatch is still questionable. I sincerely doubt it and fervently hope that what is reported will not become reality." Mrs. Lin then recounted in detail her past relationship with Lin Jing and their life together after they began living together. Based on these past events and Lin Jing's character, she adamantly defended Lin, stating that he would never form a new relationship in America. She added that between men and women, even slightly close contact can give rise to speculation, immediately labeled as love or engagement, or even cohabitation. Mrs. Lin defended him in this way because she had received a letter from Lin Jing just a week ago, in which he did not mention being engaged to anyone. Mrs. Lin spoke with great sincerity.</p>
<p>She then spoke of her feelings for her sister and the number of children they had raised together. Mrs. Lin's voice began to tremble, and tears welled up in her eyes, revealing the deep pain in her heart. According to Mrs. Lin, "My sister and I have always had a good relationship. However, after I lived with Lin, the natural evolution of human relationships led to a situation of estrangement. I am reluctant to share this with outsiders. My husband is exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable. After marrying my sister and me, and now with a house full of children, anyone with any sense of family would never recklessly talk about love again. This is my reasoning, and it is also why I firmly believe that the story of my husband being engaged to Miss White is unreliable."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lin had received a considerable education. Therefore, even in an emotionally charged environment, she was able to speak coherently. Her most touching words were, "Even if my husband does not fear public opinion, doesn't he consider the new criminal law that was promulgated on July 1st? To test the law with his own body would not be something my husband would be willing to do. I was raised with traditional values, so I am unwilling to lightly express my opinion before the facts are proven. But what I can say to you (referring to the reporter) is that the future happiness of myself and my children can only rely on the decisions of my father-in-law (referring to Chairman Lin)." At this point, Mrs. Lin burst into tears. From noon yesterday (the 19th) onwards, after learning the exact location of Mrs. Lin's residence, people flocked to visit and offer condolences. Unable to bear the disturbance, Mrs. Lin left for Tianjin with her young son this morning (the 20th). Before leaving, she told people that she had telegraphed Lin Jing to inquire about the truth of the foreign dispatch, and that she had also telegraphed Chairman Lin, requesting him to intervene. Her words were deeply meaningful. After a whistle blew, this pitiful mother and son, almost abandoned, boarded the Pingyu train for Tianjin. It is said that Mrs. Lin's trip is to get some fresh air and celebrate the birthday of a friend's mother. She will return to Beiping within a week. She has asked a neighbor, Mr. Wang, to look after her residence, and Mrs. Wang to take care of her children. (20th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Judge Inspects Corpse-Robbing Case</p>
<p>Nijiatan south of Malu Bridge in this county is where Li Zhigang of the late Ming Dynasty was buried, hence the name Hutan. Local gentry also funded the construction of a memorial pavilion for the Western missionary Bu Huilian on top of it. Later, in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolutionary Army captured Songjiang, forty-eight fallen soldiers were also buried there by Yu Jing, the captain of the Red Cross burial team at the time, who arranged for coffins and hired workers to bury them. This was reported to Commander Chiang, the Ministry of Interior, and the Provincial Government, who ordered the local administrative authorities to protect the site. However, in March of this year, someone disregarded the established case and privately demolished the memorial pavilion, excavating the site. The remains of the buried fallen soldiers were exposed, with bones scattered everywhere, a horrifying sight. The Red Cross branch wrote to the county party headquarters and the county government to stop the activity. Unable to bear the sight of the bones exposed to the elements, the Red Cross branch first hired workers to pack the bones into thirty-one boxes, affixing seals and taking photographic evidence, while also writing to the county government to order proper reburial, to emphasize humanitarianism. It was then reported that someone had stolen the bones, and they were nowhere to be found. The Red Cross branch filed a complaint with the provincial government, alleging that Tang Zhigao and others were suspected of destroying public buildings and illegally exhuming graves. The case was deemed criminal and was sent by the province to the Songjiang District Court for investigation. There have been several interrogations, as reported in various newspapers. Subsequently, Tang and others confessed at the prosecutor's office that the thirty-one boxes of bones were now buried in the northwest corner of the site. The prosecutor, based on the confession, personally led the bailiffs to inspect the site at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, summoning the plaintiff and local gentry Xi Zenghao, Red Cross branch chairman Zhou Xuewen, Li Xiuzhe, and others. The defendants, Tang Zhigao (represented by Tang Fangyu) and Yin Shikong (represented by Bai Tianyi), were questioned. After instructing the defendants to sign their statements, he ordered the excavation to begin. It was discovered that the excavated site did not match the location indicated, and the number of boxes found was only thirty, with one empty box, falling short of the original number. It was also verified that the original seals of the Red Cross branch were affixed to the boxes, but only five boxes still had them, while the rest were completely gone. Upon inspecting the bones, it was discovered that some had seals and others did not, and some were dry while others were not. It was generally believed that they were not the original bones. After the prosecutor completed the inspection, he returned to the court. This case has attracted considerable attention from the public since Prosecutor Liu's inspection.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Labor-Management Disputes at the Cotton Mill Continue</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Cotton Mill outside the West Gate of Taibaodun previously intensified management, restricted workers' working hours, forced savings, and issued "shaving coupons," which led to a general strike by all the workers. After mediation by party and government officials, the strike did not escalate. However, the factory then filed a lawsuit with the local court of this county, accusing workers Wu A'da, Fei Jin'gen, and twenty-one others of property damage and assault. The trial was scheduled for the 23rd. The mill's 1,900 male and female workers believed that their fellow workers Wu A'da and others had been unjustly accused and that the factory had no intention of reconciliation. Therefore, at approximately 7:00 AM on the 23rd, over a thousand workers jointly went to the county party headquarters to petition for relief. Commissioner Sun Xiangfeng invited Secretary Xia of the county government to meet with the workers' representatives, advising them to consider the overall situation and not cause disturbances. He also promised to continue mediation. The workers then dispersed. Subsequently, a prosecutor from the court conducted a three-hour trial, instructing both labor and management to resolve the matter themselves outside of court.</p>
<p>Nantong: Male and Female Drug Traffickers Tried by Military Law</p>
<p>Tongcheng launched a large-scale crackdown on drug traffickers, arresting seventeen male and female traffickers. The county government has handed over the witnesses and evidence to the Fourth District Security Command for trial by military judge. Due to the urgent situation, many drug offenders have fled in fear of punishment. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to various ports to investigate and apprehend them.</p>
<p>Haimen: Two Kidnappers Handed Over to the High Court for Trial</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Wang Dalang and Zhu Gushi of this county were arrested and found guilty in the kidnapping of renowned physician Sha Boqing last autumn. Wang Dalang was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhu Gushi was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. Wang and the others appealed to the Suzhou High Court. The High Court is scheduled to hear the case on the 28th of this month. On the 21st, county bailiff Yao Sihui and others escorted the two bandits, Wang and Zhu, along with the case files, to the High Court for trial.</p>

<h3>This City Spared from Hurricane; Strong Winds and Waves at Wusong Port...Sailing South Slightly Delayed</h3>
<p>The hurricane in the South Pacific made landfall one hundred and twenty miles south of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, at midnight the day before yesterday, advancing northwest. It had extremely strong force upon reaching the coast. After blowing for several hours, it dissipated due to differences in north and south air pressure. By 3:00 PM yesterday, forecasts indicated it had reached south of Jiujiang, Jiangxi, but its force was very weak. Lishui, Zhejiang, and Pucheng, Fujian, were both within the range of the hurricane's path. As for this city, the strong southeast wind yesterday was entirely due to the hurricane passing through Wenzhou, and was not a so-called "hurricane wing." The wind force was especially strong outside Wusong Port, and the seawater was stirred up by the wind into huge waves, but it had calmed down somewhat by evening. Yesterday's temperature in this city was cooler compared to the day before, due to the constant southeast wind and the flowing clouds that obscured the sunlight. The highest temperature of the day was 90.9 degrees, and the lowest was 79.5 degrees.</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening News reported that the hurricane seemed to head straight for Shanghai last night (the 22nd), but landed south of Wenzhou this morning and blew to the northwest-west, and should gradually dissipate, so Shanghai may be spared. Rain and wind in Shanghai is gradually increasing, and the situation is the same southwards to the coast. However, there are showers and gales in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait, so many ships sailing south are delaying their departure. The Dalian Maru, originally scheduled to set sail at 11:00 AM yesterday, taking the route to Qingdao and then Dalian, has been postponed to 9:00 AM this morning. China National Aviation Corporation flights to Guangzhou have also been delayed this morning, for fear of flying into the hurricane's center. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, another hurricane has appeared northwest of Yap Island and is currently moving northwest-west. Application forms and instructions for various items</p>
<h3>Loan Review Committee to Handle Credit Lending; Application Forms and Instructions Sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Distribution to Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee issued a message yesterday, stating that since receiving instructions from the Ministry of Finance to handle 5 million yuan in small credit loans, it has been actively preparing various procedures. At its sixth meeting, it was decided that the above loan would be available starting August 1. The application forms and various forms, as well as the instructions for small credit loans, will be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before the loans are issued for distribution to trade associations for filling out and returning to the committee for investigation and review. Factory owners who are not members of a trade association can also obtain the above forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to fill out and submit for verification.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry to Establish Bill Acceptance Center; Concrete Measures Being Studied; Joint Reserve Committee Members Conducting Research; Central, China, and Communications Banks to Conduct Rediscounting</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the Shanghai Banking Association believes that the decline of Shanghai's industry and commerce is particularly severe, and that the cessation and reorganization of industrial and commercial firms occurs from time to time. Although the government and the banking industry have made every effort to provide relief, recovery has been difficult due to a lack of chips. Therefore, it has proposed that the Banking Association establish a bill acceptance center to handle bank acceptance drafts. The purpose of this is to facilitate the flow of funds. The issue is currently being studied by members of the Banking Joint Reserve Committee, Bei Songsun, Li Fusun, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jizhi, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Chen Zeqing, Hu Bijang, Wu Yunqi, Ye Fuhuo, Sun Hengfu, et al., together with the committee's manager Zhu Boquan, deputy manager Xu Baoqi, assistant manager Kong Baocheng, and others, to study concrete measures. Once a draft is prepared, it will be submitted to the members' representative assembly for approval and implementation. The date of implementation will be no sooner than September. The nature of bank acceptance drafts is the same as that of commercial acceptance drafts, but their credit is even more notable than that of commercial acceptance drafts. Before maturity, they may be discounted at various banks, and at the same time, the various banks may rediscount at the Central, China, and Communications Banks. The duration of acceptance drafts is limited to four months.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Money Shops' Loan Collateral; Factory Foundations Valued According to Contract; Machinery Should Have Standards Set by Experts</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported from Nanjing on the 23rd that the Shanghai money shops' collateral for the government loans included factory foundations and machinery, which the Supervisory Committee forwarded to the Ministry of Finance to request valuation according to the contract. The Ministry of Finance has now instructed that the factory foundations be valued according to the contract and should be put on file. As for the various types of machinery, the committee should engage experts to review and determine appropriate standards.</p>
<h3>Reduction and Exemption of Export Taxes to Be Implemented After Approval; Whether Abolition of Transit Tax Will Be Implemented Simultaneously Is Undetermined</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the burden on the people and develop foreign trade, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi previously proposed a resolution to the Central Political Council to reduce and exempt export taxes and abolish transit taxes. The rules for reducing and exempting export taxes have now been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 1, but the implementation was delayed due to insufficient procedural preparation. According to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, Commissioner of Customs Zheng Lai recently submitted a proposal to Minister Kong to implement the reduction and exemption of export taxes in August or September. Once approved by Minister Kong, he will notify all customs offices to implement it on a fixed date. As for whether the abolition of transit taxes will be implemented simultaneously, it is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sichuan Ramie Cloth Association Telegraphs for Relief Measures; Army, Police, Organizations, and Schools Nationwide Should Mandatorily Use Ramie Cloth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Ramie Cloth Association submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang, stating, "The petition is for the sluggish sales of ramie cloth and the difficulties faced by industry and commerce, earnestly requesting that the army, police, organizations, and schools nationwide be ordered to mandatorily use ramie cloth, maintain the supply of goods, in order to save the endangered industry and relieve the lives of millions of workers who are about to die. Ramie cloth is a purely important handicraft industry, made from bast fibers into cloth, and sold domestically and abroad. It requires the efforts of dozens of types of laborers. Within Sichuan Province, the number of people who directly and indirectly rely on it for a living reaches over two million. Ramie cloth is of good quality and durable, and the Korean people are happy to wear Sichuan ramie, so over the years, the largest sales market has been entirely export-oriented. In the last ten years, Korea has been encouraging the planting of bast fibers and weaving of cloth, selling as much as possible, leading to a gradual reduction in sales markets over the years, and those engaged in the industry are almost unable to recover. Last year in May, the Commander of the Twenty-first Army, Liu Xiang, recognizing the impending crisis of ramie cloth, issued an order to exempt it from harsh taxes. In July of the same year, our National Government encouraged exports and ordered the exemption of national taxes. The association and its members appreciated the preferential treatment of the government and worked hard to operate, so that they were able to maintain the status quo last year. This year, the provincial government was established, and it unexpectedly revised the tax system, doubling the ramie cloth tax rate. The association has repeatedly petitioned the provincial government to request exemption, but over the past two months, the biggest changes have occurred in domestic and foreign business. The Korean sales market has plummeted, partly due to heavy Japanese taxes and partly due to the decline in the eastern exchange rate. For example, one Japanese yen is only worth seven jiao of Shanghai currency. Our ramie cloth sells in Korea for four yuan and two jiao per bolt of 48-count cloth, which is equivalent to four yuan and two jiao, but after deducting the tax of two yuan and two jiao, the actual profit is three yuan, which is only equivalent to two yuan and two jiao in the exchange rate. The purchase price of this cloth last winter at the place of origin was three yuan and two or three jiao per bolt, and another five jiao had to be paid to transport it to Shanghai. The current selling price is so low that it is impossible to avoid losses. However, the situation is so extreme that it cannot be sold. In Shanghai, the goods are piled up like mountains. Domestic sales rely entirely on the north. Since the four northeastern provinces were occupied by the puppet state, customs duties have been levied, almost reaching a hundred percent of the value. Ramie cloth dares not be transported there, losing a great sales market. This year, there has been a major drought in the Tianjin and Hebei areas, and the people are struggling to survive, further diminishing their purchasing power. Given all of the above circumstances, those engaged in the industry are in imminent danger of collapse. They are closing down their businesses one after another, and the business difficulties can be said to have reached an extreme point. However, the people of Ronglong, Neijiang, and other four counties rely on this for a living. Today, no one is buying, and they have lost their means of livelihood. The weak will surely fill the ditches, and it is difficult to guarantee that the strong will not resort to extreme measures. Recently, Li Hongxing and Yang Xingfa, two extremely poor households in Panlong Town, Rongchang County, committed suicide by drowning due to the pressure of family life. There have also been robberies in Guanyinqiao, Tangbaotan, and Shabazi in Fucheng, which are clear evidence of this. During this period of suppressing bandits, the local situation is such that the association cannot remain silent. Ramie cloth is a special industry of Sichuan, and millions of people depend on it for a living. Now, at this critical moment, if no measures are taken to provide relief and it is allowed to perish, what will become of local security? After much deliberation, the association has come up with a relief plan. Currently, no one is buying ramie cloth, and the value at the place of origin is extremely low. For example, 48-count cloth, which sold for two yuan and two or three jiao last winter, is now priced at around two yuan, and 13-count cloth, which previously sold for two yuan and eight or nine jiao, is now priced at one yuan and seven or eight jiao. These two types of goods were previously sold in Korea. If they were used to make military uniforms, they would not only be durable and suitable for summer wear, but also very suitable for autumn wear. They would also be economical and in line with the principles of life. If the army, police, organizations, and schools nationwide were required to use them, even if they were not sold in Korea, not only would millions of workers in Sichuan have work to do, but the ramie cloth of Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces would also be in short supply. It is the best plan to rescue millions of lives without spending money and also maintain national goods and industries. We, the members of the committee, admire Chairman Chiang's divine and heroic spirit. He has entered Sichuan to suppress bandits and save the people from fire and water. All the people of Sichuan are grateful and admiring. The association humbly presents this humble suggestion, hoping that it will be adopted. We beseech you to consider that ramie cloth is a commercial industry that has a huge impact on labor. The situation is now urgent, and we especially hope that you will issue a clear order to relieve the suffering. In the Jiangzhe area, purchases can be made in Shanghai, and in Sichuan, we request that personnel be dispatched to Zhongjiang and Leshan counties to purchase it. We now present a bolt of 48-count and 13-count plain-colored ramie cloth each. If there is anything appropriate, we respectfully request that you review and instruct us to obey. We are in utmost anxiety and await your orders." Sincerely submitted by the Shanghai Sichuan Ramie Cloth Association to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Flew to Qingdao Yesterday to Visit President Wang Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaoxiong, flew to Sichuan the other day to meet with Chairman Chiang and make requests regarding the financial problems of Zhejiang Province. He completed his business on the 20th and returned to Shanghai from Sichuan. He visited friends in Shanghai on the same day and was quite busy. It is now known that Mr. Huang left Shanghai at 6:30 yesterday morning, boarding a Douglas aircraft to fly to Qingdao to visit President Wang, who is ill. Mr. Huang plans to stay in Qingdao for a short period before returning to Hangzhou to preside over provincial affairs.</p>
<h3>Dutch Envoy to China Embarks to Take Up Post; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 27th</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Dutch Envoy to China, Baron Frans van Tuyll van Serooskerken, has departed from the Netherlands and is en route to China via the Dutch East Indies to take up his new post. The "Tjisedane", a ship of the Java-China-Japan Line carrying the Dutch Envoy, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th. It is reported that van Tuyll van Serooskerken is a Doctor of Law who entered the diplomatic service in 1917 and has served at the Dutch embassies in Colombia, Washington, Turkey, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and Beijing. He has lived in China for a long time, so he has a good understanding of the situation in China. He has been promoted from Counselor of the Dutch Embassy in Germany to Envoy to China. During his journey to China, van Tuyll van Serooskerken spent two weeks in the Dutch East Indies. After arriving in Shanghai, he will not enter Beijing immediately, but will wait for Chairman Lin to return to Beijing from Lushan and approve the date for the presentation of his credentials, after which he will proceed to Beijing to meet the President and present his credentials.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Magistrate Long Inspects Seawall Project Yesterday; Taking Precautions Against Dangers to the Seawall Due to Hurricane; Continuous Wind and Rain Have Damaged Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Long Tiyao inspected the seawall project throughout the county in mid-month due to the serious flooding of the Yangtze River, and instructed the seawall engineering office to take extra precautions. Due to the impact of the hurricane in recent days, the southeast wind has been very strong, and the waves on the sea surface are extremely turbulent. Believing that the protection of the seawall during the hurricane season required even more stringent measures, Long, accompanied by Secretary Wang Rong, inspected the Longwangmiao, Xuejiatan, and Wuhedun areas outside Wusong Port at 5:00 AM yesterday, and instructed the seawall engineering office to increase construction in low-lying areas to prevent the seawall from being damaged by the turbulent waves of the sea. He returned to the county office after 9:00 AM. According to Long, as the seawall was extensively rebuilt last year and is very strong, only extra precautions need to be taken during this year's autumn flood season to ensure there will be no major problems. Furthermore, due to continuous wind and rain in the county, power and telephone lines have been damaged at one time. The county office has ordered protection at various locations to maintain traffic. However, the crops in various villages have also been damaged due to excessive rain.</p>
<h3>Xin Mingxing Ship Runs Aground on Yangluo River Surface; Situation Is Very Dangerous; Goods and Coal Are Currently Being Unloaded</h3>
<p>From Hankou to Taiziji, the Yangtze River has no boundaries, and land and water are indistinguishable, a vast expanse of water. Where is the channel in the heart of the river? Where are the fields on the riverbank? Only the vast expanse of water can be seen, making navigation on the Yangtze River extremely difficult for ships traveling back and forth. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangda ship ran aground on the opposite bank of Yangluo, the Xin Mingxing ship of the Sanbei Steamship Company, which was sailing from Nanjing to Hankou, also ran aground near the Jiangda ship on the 22nd, below the Jiangda ship, mistakenly sailing onto the land on the riverbank.</p>
<p>Failed Towing; The Xin Mingxing ran aground on the right bank of Yangluo. At the time, the ship's hull was stuck in the mud of the shoal, making it impossible to move. The shipowner immediately measured the waterline around the ship. A depth of five feet was found at the bow, and a depth of eight feet was found at the stern. The shipowner then telegraphed the Hankou branch for help. Initially, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wangyu ship was being used in Hankou to tow the Jiangda ship, so it was requested to tow it instead. The Jiangyu ship complied with the Xin Mingxing ship's request and towed it, but to no avail. Subsequently, the Sanbei Hankou branch dispatched the Xing Shi ship to tow it. After attaching two steel cables, it opened its engines to full power to tow, but the steel cables broke, and the Xin Mingxing ship could not be moved even a fraction.</p>
<p>Ship Body Tilting; The Shanghai headquarters received a telegram from the shipowner stating that the towing of the Xin Mingxing ship was hopeless, and that as the river water was currently receding, the grounding site was on land above the riverbank. If no measures were taken to rescue it before the water receded, it would be in imminent danger. The ship's hull is now gradually tilting, making it even more precarious. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai headquarters decided to completely unload the cargo from the ship, and if necessary, even dismantle the upper part of the ship, so that only the hull would remain, which would then be able to float with a draft of only four feet. They have telegraphed Hankou to follow these instructions.</p>
<p>Unloading Cargo; It is difficult to find a large barge for this ship. At first, inquiries were made to Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, but they were unsuccessful. Yesterday afternoon, the Hankou branch telegraphed that a large barge had been rented from Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, which would be sent to Yangluo immediately. Workers were also dispatched from Hankou to unload the cargo and coal onto the barge. After the cargo has been unloaded, attempts will be made to tow it out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ship Body Condition; The Xin Mingxing ship was newly purchased by the Sanbei Company from Jardine Matheson, with a ship price of 190,000 yuan. After major repairs and the addition of a raised navigation deck, it became the first handsome ship among the company's Yangtze River ships. Its gross tonnage is 2,770 tons, its length is 278 feet and one inch, its width is 42 feet and nine inches, and its full-load draft is 12 feet. The Sanbei Company is now making every effort to save it, because once the floodwaters recede, the ship will be beyond towing and extrication.</p>
<h3>Chen Ce Discusses the Return of the Two Ships: The Navy Must Be Unified Under the Central Government</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Chen Ce, Director of the Military Affairs Department of the Military Commission, was ordered earlier this month to go to Hong Kong to lead the Haiqi and Haishen warships back to the fleet in the north. He has now completed his mission and returned to Nanjing, and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on everything. Mr. Chen's wife arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong the day before yesterday, and Mr. Chen went to Shanghai from Nanjing early the day before yesterday to meet her. They took the night train back to Nanjing last night at 11 o'clock. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Mr. Chen to inquire about the return of the two ships to the north. According to Mr. Chen, the central government had not received any reports before the Haiqi and Haishen warships left Guangdong. It was not until the morning after the two ships left Guangdong that the Military Commission received a telegram from Chairman Chen Bonan, requesting that all fortresses be notified to receive them. In the afternoon, they received a telegram from the captains of the two ships, expressing their support for the central government and requesting accommodation. The central government then sent someone to Hong Kong to lead the two ships back to the north. After arriving in Hong Kong, I immediately boarded the ships to offer my condolences. The officers and soldiers of both ships sincerely expressed their absolute obedience to the central government. They then set sail from Hong Kong on the 9th and returned north. In addition to purchasing coal for more than 10,000 yuan and procuring a small amount of food, there were no conditions for the two ships to return north. The voyage was slower because of a visit to Xiangshan and Zhenhai. It was not until the 18th that they arrived in Nanjing and docked at Xiaguan to await orders. After arriving in Nanjing, I immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report everything. The issue of the current organization of the two ships is still awaiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. I believe that the navy must be unified under the guidance of the central government, and our country has very few warships, so too many units should not be established. The two ships underwent major repairs in Hong Kong before. There was absolutely no damage this time they left Guangdong. Although the two ships are old, their speed and other aspects are very good, especially the Haiqi. Therefore, there is no need to dock for repairs at this time.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>

<h3>Young Aviator Mr. Kuang Jingtang Returns Home After Completing His Studies</h3>
<p>Young aviator Mr. Kuang Jingtang, a native of Taishan County, Guangdong Province, first graduated from the British Canadian Eastern Aviation Academy. Later, realizing the lack of talent in aircraft manufacturing in our country, he went to the Boeing Aviation Engineering Academy in the United States to study engineering. After graduating in four years, he has now returned home after completing his studies and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. When the former Consul General in San Francisco, Mr. Kuang Guanglin, went to the United States, Mr. Kuang flew an airplane hundreds of miles out of the harbor and performed a flower-throwing ceremony as a welcoming gesture. His technique was very skilled and was praised by the Americans.</p>
<h3>National Seaport Quarantine Office: New Quarantine Hospital Completed, but Has Not Yet Started Admitting Patients</h3>
<p>The National Seaport Quarantine Office's old quarantine hospital, located in Pudong, covers an area of more than fifty acres. The hospital site is substantial and can accommodate many patients. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed by artillery fire during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Since then, it has been extremely inconvenient to treat those with infectious diseases. Therefore, last year, a vacant lot of eight acres was found at the mouth of the Huangpu River. Construction began in June of the same year. It is divided into two floors. The upper floor has a library, object display room, and medical officers' residences, etc. The lower floor has a diagnosis and examination room, dispensary, superior and ordinary wards, experiment room, and bathing room, etc. The equipment is exquisite and has been fully completed last month. However, although it is now high summer, there has been no discovery of various infectious diseases, so no patients have yet been admitted. The hospital address is connected to the Jianghaiguan signal station, and transportation is very convenient.</p>

<h3>The "New Life Weekly" Case: Lawyers Association Resolves to Submit to the Judicial Yuan for Correction and Replies to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, regarding the sentencing of Du Chongyuan in the "New Life Weekly" case, received a request from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to study the legal disputes. The Standing Committee discussed it for a long time that night and resolved to submit a request to the Judicial Yuan and reply to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The reply letter is recorded below: We have received your letter stating that Mr. Mu Ouchu reported that the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court's trial of the case of She Chongyuan, editor and publisher of "New Life Weekly," was illegal and inhumane, and requested that we uphold justice and clarify the corrective measures. Because the matter involves legal disputes, please let us study it and reply. Upon investigation, if there are errors in the court's judgment, appeals should be made to the higher trial authorities to seek correction. There are no other methods. The first point mentioned in Mr. Mu's original letter has already been submitted by this association to the Judicial Yuan for correction. A copy of the submission is attached. If your association believes that Mr. Mu's claim is justified, it may submit a request to the Judicial Yuan's Ministry of Judicial Administration for correction. As for the second and third points, this association believes that they concern the court's discretion in sentencing and belong to the court's duties. It is only appropriate to seek relief during the appeal process. It is not appropriate to make any criticisms. It should wait until the appeal of this case is permitted before making claims in the appeal procedure. This is our reply. We hope you will take note of it. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Banks in Various Places Have Submitted Requests to the Ministry of Finance to Exempt Checks from Stamp Duty, Fearing It Will "Drive Fish into the Deep and Chase Birds into the Thicket"</p>

<h3>Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association Sends Letter Requesting Reduction of Tai Road Bus Prices and Opposes the Creation of Distorted Fare Schedules</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Company, requesting a reduction in bus fares to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The letter states: We have received reports from association members stating that the Shanghai-Tai Company's long-distance buses operating on the Shanghai-Tai line have recently reduced fares across the board starting on July 16 due to the impact of the opening of the Xihu Road, in order to compete. However, upon investigation, the actual situation is unbearable to speak of. According to past rates, a one-way ticket for the Shanghai-Luodian section was sold for 83 cents, a round-trip ticket was sold for 1 yuan and 5 li, and a return ticket was sold for 58.1 cents. This time, the company superficially reduced prices, but in fact increased the fare for the Shanghai-Luodian line. The most ridiculous thing is that it is 10 kilometers from Jiading to Shanghai and the fare is 69 cents, while it is only 23 kilometers from Luodian to Shanghai and the fare is also 69 cents. Is this kind of price designed to deliberately raise the price of the Shanghai-Luodian section? Or should passengers on the Luodian-Shanghai section assume a special obligation for a certain part of the company's responsibility? It is truly incomprehensible after thinking about it. The Shanghai-Luodian line is the throat of the Shanghai-Tai road and the lifeline of Shanghai-Luodian commerce. It relies entirely on this. To develop the transportation on the Shanghai-Tai road and maintain the prosperity of Luodian, this distorted fare should not be created and criticized by the local area. It is requested to send a letter to the company to correct this error and provide the same treatment as passengers on the Xihu line, reducing the fare by 20 cents for the 7-kilometer Jiading-Luodian section and changing the fare for the Shanghai-Luodian section to 48 cents. We have found that the distorted fare schedule set by your company this time is based on unknown grounds. Long-distance buses are public transportation vehicles and should not be for profit. Even more, passengers on the Shanghai-Luodian line should not be considered deceivable and arbitrarily burdened. It is inconsistent with human feelings and legal principles. Moreover, in this time of rural bankruptcy and commercial depression, passengers are forced to travel out of necessity. The difficulties of the times should be shared to develop enterprises along the route and seek transportation benefits. If your company transfers the income affected by the Xihu line to burden passengers on the Shanghai-Luodian line, it will greatly affect your company's reputation. For the sake of your company's business and the rights of our members, we have to argue based on reason and request that the ticket prices for each station on the Shanghai-Luodian, Shanghai-Jiading, and Shanghai-Chang sections be reduced in order to benefit the local area. I hope you will investigate and reply. Addressed to the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Company.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Records Published, Covering Various Aspects of Jiangsu Province's Past and Present</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Records are published by the New China Construction Society at No. 112 Central District Government Road, Shanghai. The association believes that Jiangsu Province is a central hub in China. The province's administrative facilities, as well as social conditions of today and yesteryear, have consistently been of concern to the people of the country. However, there are no complete records available for investigation, and there is a lack of systematic documentation. It is difficult for anyone wanting to study various Jiangsu Province issues. Therefore, in October of last year, it specifically formed the Jiangsu Province Investigation Department, and invited Mr. Zhao Ruheng to widely collect books, newspapers, magazines related to Jiangsu Province, and materials provided by relevant organizations and private individuals, totaling more than 200 types. They were compiled into a system and edited from beginning to end, covering various aspects of Jiangsu Province's past and present. From beginning to now, it has been almost completed. In addition to the enthusiastic support of Jiangsu Province officials, the Jiangsu Province scholars have been invited by the association's branches to carefully review and approve it before publication. The book's content is divided into general overview, party affairs, politics, finance, education, construction, industry, society, arts and culture, and biographical chapters. The general overview is further divided into the evolution, area, population, terrain, rivers, climate, soil, concessions, foreigners, sections. Party affairs are divided into party history, organization, publicity, mass movements, funding, and party member sections. Politics is divided into administrative organization, civil affairs, justice, policy programs sections. Finance is divided into the financial situation of previous years, financial administration organization, financial administration order, expenditure, income, police, financial reorganization plan sections. Education is divided into school education, including vocational education, social education, education funding, and education plan sections. Construction is divided into the administrative organization of construction, transportation, water conservancy, posts and telecommunications, construction funding sections. Arts and Culture and biographical chapters divided into the academic, arts, scenic spots, historical sites, and national heroes sections. It also includes a large number of investigation tables, as well as dozens of valuable photos of figures and scenic spots. The book totals more than one million words and is truly an unprecedented masterpiece in Jiangsu Province's literature. The price per copy is five yuan for hardcover and four yuan for softcover. Local branches are located in Kaiming Bookstore, Qingyun, Modern, Author, Shenghuo Bookstore, Donghua Bookstore in Zhenjiang, Datong Bookstore in Wuxi, and Zhengzhong Bookstore and Central Bookstore in Nanjing, all of which are specially appointed to sell the book.</p>

<h3>Xu Yabo's Memorial Service Scheduled; Relatives and Friends Suggest Cash Donations to Help the Widows and Orphans</h3>
<p>It has been more than two months since the former district chief of the Jiangsu Water Police, Mr. Xu Yabo, passed away at his residence on April 13th of this year. His family, relatives, friends, and disciples have scheduled a memorial service for Mr. Xu to be held at Qingliang Temple in Xinjiaroad's Xinjiag Garden on July 28th (this Sunday). The obituary notice was issued some days ago. It is also heard that, given that Mr. Xu's family is in extreme poverty after his death, leaving behind widows and orphans struggling to make ends meet, a very sad situation, his relatives and friends are suggesting that those who receive Mr. Xu's obituary notices send cash donations instead of funeral banners, couplets, or paper money, so as to gather strength and help the bereaved family. Presumably, Mr. Xu's old friends and disciples all understand his plight and sympathize with him. They will surely sympathize with this act of helping the living and comforting the dead.</p>

<h3>Can Opium Ash Really Treat Diarrhea? A Child's Life Was Wrongly Lost</h3>
<p>Gu Shunzeng, a 39-year-old carriage driver for the Tiekia Automobile Company on Rue Massenet in the French Concession, is a native of Ningbo. He and his wife, Zhang, 35 years old this year, live together in a pavilion room at No. 6 *Shikumen* on Rue Cardinal Mercier. Their five-month-old boy, named Guanghua, was fat and lively and was much loved by the Gu couple. Unexpectedly, he recently suffered from diarrhea, a disease of twenty days duration, with no successful treatments. Gu's wife, Zhang, heard a folk remedy passed on by a neighbor, saying that opium ash can cure all diseases. Therefore, the day before yesterday, she obtained a little bit of opium ash from a friend. At noon, she gave it to the child to swallow. Unexpectedly, because he swallowed too much, he was poisoned. The child became unconscious. He was immediately sent to the Furen Hospital on Rue de l'Amiral Bayle for treatment. The poisoning was already deep, and the treatment was ineffective. He died at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. As usual, the hospital reported to the Xinzha police station, which informed the French police station.

<h3>Rickshaw Garage Restaurant Association's Romantic Debt: Suicide by Poisoning Ends Tragically</h3>
<p>Gan A-wu, a 30-year-old native of Yancheng, has been a rickshaw puller. Previously, he pulled rickshaws in Hanzhuang. He often took the women of the village out for entertainment, so his income was quite abundant, with a monthly income of tens of dollars. Relying on his savings, he gradually became intimate with a village woman named Lan Ying, using all his money on her in order to establish a permanent love. Unexpectedly, beautiful scenes do not last forever. The head of the village found out and, because Gan's actions were related to the village's reputation, stopped Gan from leaving the village a month ago. He changed to working as a peddler. He lived in No. 20 Yuli, Zhujiaqiao. He often borrowed shop space in the back. Every day he left early and returned late. Recently, Gan again had amorous desires, planning to wait for a prostitute, hoping to go out for a meeting. Unexpectedly, he was rejected by the woman. Gan felt that the woman had no gratitude and, thinking about it, harbored suicidal thoughts. The day before yesterday, in the early morning, he bought poison pills and committed suicide. After taking the poison, he returned to his residence to sleep. When the poison took effect, Shen Pinshan, who lived in the same residence, discovered it and rushed Gan to Renji Hospital for help. Because the venom had spread too deeply, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 PM that afternoon. The hospital notified the French police station, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for an autopsy. They also summoned Gan's brother, Wang Youzhi, to the case. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the hall at noon. It was determined that the deceased, Wang A-wu, had committed suicide by taking poison before his death. The body was handed over to the elder brother for burial.</p>

<h3>Ship's Sailor Fights and Extorts Money: Zhu Xigen Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Wang Fugui, a native of Ningbo, works as a sailor on the British Qingdao liner with a monthly salary of 50 yuan. A fellow sailor named A-rong recently had a fight with someone on the ship while it was sailing to Qingdao and disrupted the ship's operations. He was fired and blamed Wang Fugui for instigating it. At around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, A-rong colluded with several vagrants to make things difficult for Wang outside the British Consulate on the Bund, demanding 100 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise they would beat him. They once went to a certain place in Pudong for negotiations, but it was unsuccessful. At around 9:00 PM, they returned to Puxi and went to the Hongjiang Teahouse at No. 295 Yuanfang Road. As a result, local man Zhu Xigen intimidated Wang into paying A-rong 50 yuan to settle the matter. Later, they demanded an additional 20 yuan. Wang only had four yuan on him and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhu, along with his brother Zhu Xisheng and friend Cao Caijin. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the previous events.

<h3>Inspection of Pedestrians Leads to Arrest of Two Thieves: Perpetrators of Robbery at Zhuang Wenxiang's Home</h3>
<p>The home of Zhuang Wenxiang, a small financier, located at No. 1 Zhuangjiazhai, Xujiahui, Shanghai, was suddenly invaded by five bandits around 10 PM the night before. Speaking with northern accents, they made off with sixty silver dollars, a gold bracelet, a gold hand ornament, four gold hairpins, and two pairs of silk trousers with gold bead patterns. After the robbery, the thieves fled in different directions. Around 11 PM that same night, officers from the Ximen Branch, stationed at the Xinxihuan Sub-station of the Zhaofeng Road Police Outpost, including Sergeant Wang Shengdong, were inspecting pedestrians at the intersection of Longhua Road, Kangwei Road, and Damuqiao Road. They noticed two men who appeared flustered and were attempting to flee. The officers immediately ordered them to stop and bravely moved forward to arrest them. The two men were found to be carrying a fake pistol and two pairs of silk trousers. They were immediately escorted to the Ximen Branch. After interrogation by Chief Li, the thieves confessed. One was named Wang Zhaosan, 25 years old, from Beiping, residing at No. 10, Huile Lane, Sima Road. The other was Zhang Zhiqing, 33 years old, from Baoding, residing on Dapu Road in the Nanshi area. The thieves confessed that around 6 PM the previous afternoon, Liu Yuheng, who lived at the intersection of Jumen Road and Xietu Road, invited them to his home, along with a Mr. Sun, a Mr. Liu, and an unidentified man, to discuss robbing the Zhuangjiazhai residence. They set off around 6 PM and arrived at their destination around 8 PM. Mr. Liu went inside first to search and rob, and they followed him in. They didn’t clearly know what was being stolen at the time. When they came out, Liu Yuheng gave Wang Zhaosan a fake pistol and two pairs of silk trousers, and they fled in different directions, until they were apprehended by the police near Damuqiao Road. After obtaining this confession, Chief Li immediately dispatched the squad leader of the Detective Team, Shen Wenda, to lead detectives, together with officers from the branch, to search the residence of Liu Yuheng at the intersection of Jumen Road and Xietu Road. However, Liu Yuheng and the others had already fled upon hearing the news. Liu Yuheng's wife was taken into custody. In addition to notifying the Xujiahui Branch for assistance in the arrest, detective officers were also ordered to strictly pursue the fleeing thieves Liu Yuheng and others, to apprehend them for further investigation. Wang Zhaosan, Zhang Zhiqing, Liu's wife, the fake pistol, and the two pairs of silk trousers were all sent to the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Young Worker Entices and Abducts Young Girl, Takes Her to Wuxi Under Pretense of Buying Watermelon Seeds</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 12:30 AM, Chen Yongqing, a police officer at Post No. 20 of the Zhabei Daozhen Road Police Outpost, was on duty on Wuzhen Road when a plaintiff named Xu Guolou, accompanied by his daughter A'di, brought the defendant Shao Yuquan and accused him of enticing and abducting his daughter to Wuxi. The officer immediately brought the plaintiff, defendant, and A’di to the outpost. After questioning by Inspector Luo Siwei, Xu Guolou stated that he was 40 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at No. 16, Xiaolu Lane, Guoqing Road, and worked as a laborer. In [blank] month of this year, his daughter A'di was deceived and taken to Wuxi by Shao Yuquan, where she was sexually assaulted. Although he had been searching everywhere without success, he eventually discovered her whereabouts and brought her back. He requested a severe punishment. Xu A'di stated that she was 18 years old, that the plaintiff was her father, and that she sold watermelon seeds. About a month ago, the defendant invited her to the North Railway Station to buy watermelon seeds, but unexpectedly took her to Wuxi, where she lived for more than three months. Now he has brought her back to Shanghai for about a month. He kept her locked in the house and did not allow her to go out. Shao Yuquan stated that he was 30 years old, from Wuxi, and currently lived at No. 55, Chongde Lane, Nanxing Road, earning a living as a laborer. It was true that he took Xu A'di to Wuxi, but A'di willingly went with him. He did not prevent her from going out, and he asked for leniency. After reviewing the statements, Inspector Luo determined that the case concerned the enticement and abduction of a young girl and ordered it to be sent to the Xinzha Branch for disposition. After further questioning by officer Huang Chongren, the case was transferred to the Public Security General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>The "New Life Weekly" Case: Du Houyu's Appeal and Protest</h3>
<p>Criminal Protest Form</p>
<p>Concerning the matter of filing a protest against an illegal ruling: I, the protester, am unconvinced by the Jiangnan Higher Court Second Branch's ruling to reject the appeal in the case of Du Chongyuan's disruption of international relations. I hereby submit this protest, with the following reasons:</p>
<p>According to our country's criminal procedure law, a three-trial system is the principle, while a two-trial system for some minor cases is the exception. A single-level trial determined by the first instance lacks legal basis. The original ruling’s reasons for not allowing the appeal, based on Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law with reference to Article 367, Section 2 of the same law, is arbitrary and unlawful. Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law intends that for minor cases decided by the second instance, no appeal to the third instance court is allowed. Article 61 of the Criminal Law uses terms such as “minor circumstances” and “clearly deserving of leniency.” The crime of disrupting international relations concerns national security and is not considered a minor offense. It requires special caution, as stipulated in Article 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which groups it with crimes of internal and external conflict, with the Higher Court as the first instance. The original ruling mistakenly considers a matter requiring special caution as a minor offense, which is inappropriate. Furthermore, it completely ignores the phrase “after being judged by the second instance” in the original article, claiming that whether the original court was the first or second instance is irrelevant to the issue. How can such a misunderstanding of the law occur? Article 367, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law only demonstrates the procedure applied by the highest court when hearing appeals against first-instance judgments from the Higher Court. In essence, when the Supreme Court accepts an appeal against a second-instance judgment from the Higher Court, it can usually be done in writing, and its examination is limited to whether there has been a violation of the law. For appeals against first-instance judgments of the Higher Court, the Supreme Court is the second instance in terms of trial level, but the hearing procedure follows the third-instance procedure instead of the second-instance procedure. This is completely unrelated to whether appeals are allowed against first-instance judgments of the Higher Court. How can there be room for misinterpretation? If the original ruling's claim is correct, why doesn’t Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law say “cases judged by the Higher Court cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court,” but instead states “cases judged by the first instance cannot be appealed to the third instance court”? Isn't the original legislative intention obvious? Furthermore, if a first-instance judgment can be considered final, what about the situation when the defendant receives a guilty verdict and loses [blank]? Leaving that aside, what remedy is there if the defendant receives a not-guilty verdict and is released [blank]? (omitted) Article 376 of the Criminal Procedure Law states that the original court should reject the case, which is based on the premise that there is a valid appeal. In this case, due to a misinterpretation of the law, it is not applicable. In short, the original court, according to the regulations of the Court Organization Law, has jurisdiction over this case, which is clearly a first-instance matter. Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law states that appeals to the third instance court are not allowed after a judgment from the first instance. It is absolutely impermissible for the court to consider itself to be in a second-instance position after rendering a first-instance judgment. If this precedent is set, the spirit of the trial system stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law will be completely lost, and the meaning of jurisdiction stipulated in the Court Organization Law will be completely undermined. Can the sacred and inviolable judicial independence still be maintained? For the sake of our country's future rule of law, I, the protester, cannot but request your court to correct this. In addition to submitting this form to the original court for transfer, I also request your court to review and approve the annulment of the original ruling and issue a suitable new ruling. I would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Supreme Court for review.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Bank Promoting Small Loans; Increasing Capital Stock Pending Approval; Board Meeting to Reconvene on the 27th</h3>
<p>Following the reorganization of the Jiangsu Bank under orders, and the establishment of the new board of directors and supervisors, Zhao, the concurrent chairman, returned to the province to report. He will come to Shanghai within days to convene a second board meeting to discuss amending the articles of association and increasing the capital stock. The provincial government has consulted the Ministry of Finance for approval. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Second Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Bank's proposed increase of capital stock by one million yuan has been approved by the provincial government. A formal document will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Once the Ministry's approval is received, a special appropriation will be issued to supplement the capital. It is rumored that a portion of the increased capital stock will be funded by official share interest. The newly appointed directors and supervisors of the bank took office in Shanghai recently, and Chairman Zhao Dihua, the concurrent commissioner, immediately went to the province to report. The second board meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM this Saturday (the 27th) to discuss important matters such as amending the organizational charter and rules of procedure. Zhao is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow to preside over the meeting.</p>
<p>Small Loans</p>
<p>The bank has always paid great attention to regulating finance and rescuing industry and commerce. Previously, it jointly operated small loan programs with the Jiangjiang and Jiangsu Farmers' Jin Cheng banks, benefiting many small vendors. The total loan amount was 100,000 yuan, with a limit of 200 yuan per applicant. However, most borrowers took out loans of five or ten yuan. The interest rates were very low, and the loans were repaid on time. Loan distribution offices were set up in public security bureaus and township offices to reach the public. Due to its remarkable success, plans are underway to expand the program. It has also been implemented in Xuzhou and is now planned for Wujin.</p>

<h3>Chinese Firecrackers Selling Poorly in New York; Three Reasons for Decline</h3>
<p>Regarding the sales of Chinese firecrackers in New York, the International Trade Bureau announced yesterday that it had received a report from the Chinese Consulate in Wellington stating that the sales of Chinese firecrackers in New York are declining, and it urges firecracker merchants to pay attention. New Yorkers celebrate Guy Fawkes Day on November 5th each year. Legend has it that Guy Fawkes plotted to blow up Parliament in 1606. When the plot was discovered, he was burned to death. The English people hated him and marked it as a warning against treason. Every year on that day, several children form teams and dress up as Guy Fawkes, parading him through neighborhoods to beg for money to buy firecrackers, which are lit at night in a spectacular display. In addition, firecrackers are often lit during special celebrations as entertainment. Therefore, the annual consumption of firecrackers is considerable. In the past, all of these firecrackers were Chinese products, shipped and sold by overseas Chinese merchants, with annual sales of about six to seven thousand pounds. In recent years, the sales of Chinese firecrackers have declined sharply, with only two to three thousand pounds sold annually. The reasons for the decline are roughly threefold: (1) Seeing the large annual consumption of firecrackers and the potential for profit, New Yorkers have established their own factories to manufacture them. It is natural for Americans to buy American goods. In addition, the New York government, in order to protect its own firecracker industry, has imposed import duties on foreign firecrackers. (2) Germany and Japan have also imitated firecrackers and improved them using scientific methods. Their firecrackers have superior gunpowder and designs. Due to their large-scale production, their production costs are lower, and their prices are cheaper. Chinese firecrackers cannot compete with them. (3) The manufacturing methods of Chinese firecrackers are outdated and have not been improved. We remain defensive while others advance, which makes us look inferior. Commentators say that Chinese firecrackers do not have enough gunpowder, so they burn out quickly, and they often misfire. Foreign products can burn for several minutes and rarely misfire. Also, Chinese firecrackers have few designs, limited choices, and remain the same year after year without any changes. On the other hand, foreign firecrackers have a wide variety of styles and are renewed every year. People like the new and dislike the old, so fewer people ask about Chinese firecrackers.</p>
<h3>Publications Not Registered with the Public Concession Are Temporarily Banned from Distribution</h3>
<p>The Police Department of the Public Concession believes that various publications issued within the Public Concession that have not been legally registered with the relevant authorities should be strictly suppressed. It has ordered its police officers to go to various roads to confiscate unregistered newspapers and periodicals sold by street vendors, including the "Small Newspaper," "Great Daily," "Times Daily," "Morning Post," "Great Crystal Daily," "Robin Hood," "Social Newspaper," "Social New Newspaper," "Shanghai News," "Chinese Mainland Newspaper," "China and Foreign Forum," "Modern Daily," "Broadcasting Daily," "Elect," "National News," "Spring and Autumn Newspaper," "Star Bi-monthly," "World Armaments," "Life Daily," "Giant Wheel," "Fitness," "Goddess," "RKO," "Hot Blood," "Iron Newspaper," "Metropolis," "Rainbow Newspaper," "Spring Colors," "Youth," "Entertainment Newspaper," "Great Road," "New Life," "Literature and Art," "Ming Pao," and dozens of others. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested the ban on these unregistered newspapers based on the Publication Law and submitted a list of the names of the newspapers to be banned. After examination by Judge Qian Hongye, he immediately approved that the distribution of the listed publications should be temporarily suspended until they are legally registered. The publications will be temporarily stored in the court.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports British Soldier Arrested for Armed Robbery; Apprehended by Another Westerner and Handed Over to British Military Authorities for Punishment</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, a British soldier committed an armed robbery last night (the 22nd). Details have not yet been disclosed by the Jing'an Temple Road police station. However, according to eyewitnesses, the soldier entered a German-owned bar on Jing'an Temple Road before 11 PM, ordered a bottle of beer, then went upstairs to make a phone call to hire a car. When he learned that the car had arrived at the door, the soldier pulled out a pistol and ordered the Chinese accountant to open the cash register. While the Chinese man hesitated, the soldier pressed a button to open it himself, took some money, ran out the door, jumped into the car, and urged the driver to speed away with his pistol. The accountant chased after him, shouting for a thief. A Westerner passing by quickly caught him. After a brief struggle, he subdued the soldier, escorted him to the Jing'an Temple Road police station, and verified that the pistol was not loaded with real bullets. The soldier was then handed over to the British military authorities for punishment.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Problem Solved in Wusong; Tap Water to Be Supplied Starting August 1st</h3>
<p>Wusong has never had tap water facilities. The daily drinking water for the people has mostly been taken from the Huangpu River. After the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company acquired the Baoming Electric Company, the exclusive right to supply water to Wusong and other places was approved by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Government and transferred to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In March of this year, the company began planning the water supply project for the entire Wusong area. The first phase involves laying water pipes along various roads, including Jungong Road (from Zhanghuabang to Yunzaobang Bridge), Waima Road (from Yunzaobang Bridge to Dongxin Road), Songxing Road (from Huanzhang Road to Waima Road), and Zhongxin Road (from Waima Road to Songxing Road), laying 150 kilometers of 100-millimeter diameter water pipes. The work was completed in the middle of this month. The pipes are currently being flushed, and tap water is scheduled to be supplied starting on August 1st. At the beginning of operations, the company has also established special preferential measures to promote water use, which have been distributed to households in Wusong. From now on, residents of Wusong will have access to clean drinking water that meets health standards.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Accused of Murder Files Appeal; Case Requires Investigation; Appellant Remanded Pending Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Gong Jinlin, the owner of Jingguang Grocery Store in Yangjiadu Town, Puxi, previously filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the Local Court accusing Wu Tianzhi (24 years old, from Haiyan), the police chief of Yangjiadu Police Station, of attempted murder out of personal malice. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin investigated and found the accusations to be true, and the case was prosecuted in the Criminal Court. After trial, Wu Tianzhi was sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment as a warning. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that Wu Tianzhi has filed an appeal against the verdict. The cause of this case was that on the night of November 28th of the seventh year [of the Republic, i.e. 1918], at 2 AM, Wu Tianzhi climbed onto Gong Jinlin's window with a ladder, intending to harm his life, and fired a gun to intimidate him. Zhou, a police officer on duty near Gong Jinlin's house at the time, testified that he heard a sound similar to a firecracker around 1 AM that night and saw Wu Tianzhi moving a ladder in the alley near Gong Jinlin's house. Wu Tianzhi vehemently denied Zhou's testimony, claiming that Zhou violated police regulations while on duty and dared to accept bribes of four jiao from the people. He reported this to the station chief, who punished Zhou with a demerit and a reprimand. Zhou thus harbored a grudge and sought revenge by making false accusations. Therefore, he disagreed with the verdict and submitted the reasons for his appeal according to the law. Yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Cai Dincheng and Associate Judges Shao and Zhang held a public joint hearing and ordered the imprisoned Wu Tianzhi to be brought to the court to recount the events. Wu Tianzhi claimed that Gong Jinlin sold inferior goods and bought stolen goods. He repeatedly warned Gong Jinlin, which led to a feud and the false accusations. He requested an investigation. Gong Jinlin stated that he had been running a store in Yangjiadu Town for many years, with a legitimate business license. His store has always refused to sell inferior goods and has never bought stolen goods. He welcomed an investigation. The judges determined that an investigation was necessary and ordered the defendant to be remanded for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Notorious Bandit Leader Yue Dashuai and Others Escorted to Zhenjiang; Only One of Four Major Bandits Escapes; Peace and Tranquility Can Be Expected in the Xuzhou-Huaihai Area</h3>
<p>Yue Yougao from Funing, nicknamed Yue Dashuai (Commander Yue), also known as Yue Tuzi (Baldy Yue), a notorious bandit who has committed murder, arson, kidnapping, and extortion in more than ten counties in the Xuzhou-Huaihai area, recently fled to Shanghai. Together with his accomplices Fei Jinhong, also from his hometown, he was arrested at 2:00 AM the day before yesterday in Room 31 of the Wuling Apartment at No. 31, Bai'er Road, Taiping Bridge, French Concession, by Hu Zhen, director of the Special Affairs Section of the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters, together with detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and officers dispatched by the French Police. He was escorted to the Second Special District Court that same day to be interrogated and detained, awaiting a request from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Yue has many accomplices in Shanghai. Therefore, after arresting Yue, the French Police continued to station officers at the Wuling Apartment, waiting to arrest his accomplices. At 11:30 AM that morning, Wei Baocheng (also known as Bingnan, nicknamed San Laoban, 35 years old this year, formerly a patrol officer in the Huaian Public Security Bureau), also from Funing and an accomplice of Yue, went to the Wuling Apartment to visit Yue. The police immediately arrested him and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Special District Court, where Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, and Hu Zhen, the deputy director of the Special Affairs Section of the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters, accompanied by an investigator from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived with official documents to request a transfer. After reviewing the documents and questioning Wei about his age and place of origin, the judge ordered the bailiffs to bring Yue and Fei from the detention center for a brief interrogation. He then ordered that the defendants be handed over to the officials who came to escort them back for trial. The officials issued a receipt, shackled the three bandits, and escorted them onto a prison van of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and drove them back to the Public Security Bureau, then to the Huangpu River for transfer. According to reports, Yue's accomplices in Shanghai include Yue, Lu Wenchang (namely, Genchang), and Xu Changchun (namely, Dalaotouzi, Big Old Man). Xu has also been apprehended by the Public Security Bureau and will be escorted to the Huangpu River with Yue, Wei, and others. Only Lu Wenchang has escaped. With the loss of three major leaders, the bandits in the Xuzhou-Huaihai area can now expect peace and tranquility.</p>
<h3>Fire on Ward Road Yesterday Morning: Seven Houses Destroyed, Three People Burned to Death, Bodies Found in Rubble, Charred Beyond Recognition, Two Injured Taken to Hospital for Treatment, Cause of Fire Unknown</h3>
<p>At 2:50 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the third alley of Anle Lane, No. 540, located between Ward Road and Jingzhou Road in eastern Shanghai. At that time, it was the dead of night, and all the residents were sound asleep, so no one noticed. It was not until the fire burned the people inside the houses that they were awakened. Therefore, the house where the fire started could not be determined. However, the fire was so bright that it illuminated the sky, and the fire spread everywhere in the third alley. The intensity of the fire was unprecedented. The residents in the lane rushed to escape with their elderly and children, creating a chaotic and noisy scene. Even the residents and businesses near Anle Lane were frightened and hurriedly packed their important belongings to escape. The fire was extremely large. Fortunately, a patrolling officer spotted it early and quickly reported it to the Central Fire Brigade, who in turn notified the Eastern District Fire Brigade. Many fire trucks rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire was raging and no progress was made for a long time, and it threatened to spread to the neighboring houses in front and behind. Seeing this, the firefighters quickly focused on saving the remaining houses while bravely fighting the fire. After more than two hours, the flames were completely extinguished, and the sky was already dawning. As a result, a total of seven houses in the third alley were destroyed, including Li Bingji's woodworking shop at No. 31, Wu Yongxing's iron factory at No. 33, Tianxing Electric Silk Weaving Factory at Nos. 35, 37, and 39, and Dasheng Silk Weaving Factory at Nos. 41 and 43. At the time, two men were burned because they were slow to escape and were taken to Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment by ambulance. After checking the population of the other households, the Tianxing Silk Weaving Factory discovered that the factory owner's wife and three workers were missing. After inquiring with the neighbors, there was still no news. The fire site was then excavated. Until noon yesterday, three charred bodies were found in the rubble, covered in blood and flesh, and almost unrecognizable. The scene was extremely tragic. However, after careful identification by acquaintances, it was confirmed that they were the three missing people. An application was made to the court for an autopsy and coffining. However, the cause of the fire and who was responsible for starting it were all different. Therefore, the police are conducting a secret investigation. As for the losses, they amount to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>Opium and Tobacco Dealers in the French Concession Request Public Association to Negotiate for Exemption from Increased Taxes</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council in Shanghai started sending personnel to collect opium and tobacco taxes from various opium and tobacco shops within the concession starting in June. They planned to uniformly double the amount starting in July. Rui Dayong, Qian Ruihe, Rui Taiheji, Lao Beimen Guangda, Yingchang, Heng Hexiang, and other opium and tobacco shops on Yong'an Street were forced to increase their payments starting in June. They once sent a letter to the industry association, requesting them to send a special letter to the authorities to request exemption from the increase. Up to this point, there had been no concrete reply. These shops jointly signed and sent another letter to the association yesterday, requesting assistance again. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "Respectfully, previously, the French Municipal Council sent personnel to collect opium and tobacco taxes from our shops starting in June. Because they needed to increase the amount twofold, they repeatedly threatened and forced us to pay. If we did not pay as required, we would be fined, etc. At that time, we had no way to appeal and reluctantly managed to raise the money. Based on this, we immediately reported to the local office, who forwarded it to your association, requesting that you uphold fairness and equal treatment, and argue reasonably. At the same time, we requested that the original amount be collected starting in July. We received a reply from the French and Chinese Taxpayers Association on July 8, stating that the June payment mentioned in the letter had already been reluctantly paid, and that all opium and tobacco shops had already agreed to the increase. However, since it has already been agreed to, we should not have a third party send a letter to interfere, as this would be contrary to reason. We should find other ways to deal with it. The previous letter was difficult to accept. We hope you understand, etc. Our shops are all small businesses with little capital. We work hard all day long and it is still difficult to make a profit. Recently, there have been many unemployed people who have opened shops selling opium and tobacco, competing with each other. Not only is there no profit to be made, but we are even losing our capital. Our future livelihoods are worrying. Moreover, the economic depression in society has reached its peak. Therefore, all sectors have launched rent reduction campaigns. The municipal chamber of commerce has established a relief committee for industrial and commercial recovery, and landlords are voluntarily reducing rent to jointly rescue and relieve us. Our location is remote. Similar shops pay only 1.92 yuan per month for opium and tobacco tax. We pay 2.8 yuan per month, which is already a larger amount. At this time of economic hardship and commercial difficulties, we cannot bear any more burdens. We have no choice but to state our case. We beg your association to uphold justice, represent the industry, and appeal to the municipal chamber of commerce and others for help, requesting the French Municipal Council to continue collecting the original amount starting in July, and to grant exemption from the increase, to show compassion, etc." The association has already sent letters to the municipal chamber of commerce and the Chinese Taxpayers Association, separately requesting the French Municipal Council to grant exemption from the increase, based on the situation.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee has urged the anti-smoking agencies to strictly enforce the ban, and has strictly supervised the implementation of various anti-smoking matters to prevent abuses. Recently, the anti-smoking agencies, such as the health and public security bureaus, are actively handling the registration of smokers and smoking cessation, etc. As for the report that the Anti-Smoking Committee is registering smokers, it is a misunderstanding, because this work is purely the responsibility of the anti-smoking agencies.</p>

It is expected that by the opening day on the 25th, the 120 booths will be fully occupied.</p>
<p>The National Products World at the original site of the New World on Nanjing Road has been preparing for the opening since its inception, intensifying its work, and decided to open on August 1.

It is feared that the number of booths will not be enough. The person in charge of the world has decided to open all the houses on the second floor as a bazaar to allow as many factories as possible to participate. Since the Shanghai National Products Company closed down, patriotic people have felt the decline of the national products front. Now that the world is rising one after another, it is a good phenomenon in the year of national products. It is also said that a recreation department will be opened on the second and third floors to perform noble dramas to help Yu Xingyun.</p>

It is known that Cixi and Yuyao are the most affluent areas in Zhejiang Province, with a population of more than 800,000, and have never held any national products exhibitions. This is the first time it will be held, and it is expected that the results will be considerable.</p>
<p>The Shanghai North District National Products Movement Conference, sponsored by the China National Products Association in the North District, notified all members yesterday to postpone the arrangement. The notice said, "For the purpose of notifying matters, after checking the temporary commercial bazaar for the National Products Movement in the North District of Shanghai, which was organized by the association, it was originally scheduled to open on the 24th of this month. Now, because the 'National Products City' and the majority of manufacturers have requested the association to postpone the opening to the 28th of this month. This is an urgent notice.

<h3>Xinwei Relief Society Sends More Than 100 Refugees by Jiangshun Steamer to Various Ports along the Yangtze River</h3>

<h3>Literacy School in Gaoqiao New Port Experimental Zone Holds Supplementary Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association New Port Experimental Zone is sparing no effort to implement universal education. In particular, the Shanghai Municipal Universal Literacy Education has contacted the Gaoqiao District Office, and since the Yide Elementary School teachers and students in the district formed a literacy education service team, the teaching work has been very tense. It has been one month since the work was carried out. Recently, in order to make the public pay attention to literacy education and to connect the feelings of the students, the district specially convened all literacy service students in the district on the 21st of the month to hold a supplementary opening ceremony. The students were led by the young teachers of each group and entered the New Port Experimental Zone Office in a orderly manner. A total of 342 students and more than 1,000 male and female guests attended. The meeting was led by Mao Zhiyue, the director of the district, and the scene was very grand.

Then, Mr. Sun Xingzhi, the representative of the Gaoqiao District Office of the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee, gave a speech, meaning that everyone should have the awe of envying others' strengths, and literacy education is the only means to achieve this goal. He hoped that everyone would work together. Then, Mr. Tu Kuisheng, the director of the Improvement Association, gave a speech, saying that China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and a large population, but the people are not wise, and they are bullied by foreigners. This is because China's rich treasures have not been opened, and literacy education is the key to opening the treasure trove. Zhang Jianxiao of the Shanhai Industrial Group gave a speech, saying that in the past, China's various undertakings were in a state of stagnation, and there was no possibility of unity, which led to the loss of land and the loss of sovereignty. At present, universal education is instilling the great power to save the country. Finally, Zheng Wanyi and Sun Huijuan, students of the literacy school, gave speeches on behalf of others, saying that they were very honored that all the gentlemen were present to give guidance, and recounted the pain of being illiterate in the past and the various methods after entering the school, so that they were all children of farmers, and they could speak eloquently, which was not easy. In particular, the order of the meeting was always well-organized, which shows that the office staff in the district usually teach well.</p>

<h3>Peaceful Opinions of the President of the Royal Geographical Society of England</h3>
<p>The World Peace Association of this city recently received letters from British peace magistrate Cox, Christian evangelist George Woodman, and big industrialist Bake, all of whom expressed their support. Now, letters have also been received from Enoch, the president of the Royal Geographical Society of England, and well-known figures from all walks of life, expressing enthusiastic praise. Mr. Enoch also offered his opinions on striving for peace, stating that the only reason for international instability, which causes bloody tragedies, is that the general public is in a state of poverty, unemployment, and misery. The wealthy class worships money more and more, causing countries to enter the vortex of war. The lower classes cannot bear the oppression of suffering, thus creating revolutionary wars. If we want to avoid the occurrence of all unfortunate events between nations and within society, the fundamental solution is to implement genuine education, strictly adhere to economic principles, and enable everyone to have a comfortable life and a stable position. Then the world will enter the right track, and we can all immerse ourselves in a happy homeland. Therefore, my humble opinion is that the way to seek peace lies in promoting a rational way of life.</p>

<h3>Swimming Training Diagram (2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Binqi</p>
<p>Weissmuller Style: After Weissmuller set the world record for the 100-meter freestyle in 1924, the American swimming community imitated and learned a lot. It is now popular all over the world and is called the American crawl. Weissmuller's posture is different from the others. Nine-tenths of his head is out of the water. When breathing, his cheek is crooked and his mouth is submerged to breathe in, and exhaled in the water (see picture). The breathing is average, the wrists are not fully extended, and the strokes are the same. When stroking the water, the thumb and wrist are turned inward to stroke the water out of the water. The water waves do not ripple, the stroking force is greater, enough to hit the water. The toes are inward relative to each other, the knees are fully straightened, the water waves are turned upwards, and the feet enter the water eight inches, which is enough to move, three times faster than the hands.</p>
<p>Weissmuller, an American swimmer, holds the world championship in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 57.4 seconds.</p>
<h3>On the Future Improvements of Physical Education in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Liu Changhe</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Changhe graduated from the Physical Education Department of National Central University in Nanjing, excelling in both academics and practical skills. He previously served as the Deputy Director of Physical Education at Wuhan University, achieving remarkable results. Mr. Liu, observing the vigorous promotion of physical education in our country in recent years, but deeply concerned about it heading towards abnormal development, went to the United States to study at Springfield College, majoring in physical education administration and teacher training programs that are currently lacking domestically. At the same time, he conducted on-site investigations into the implementation of physical education in various parts of the United States. Mr. Liu has now returned to China after completing his studies. This article is Mr. Liu's initial opinions on the future improvements of physical education in our country after returning, with insights that are unique and can serve as an important reference for the physical education community in our country. Physical education is greatly related to national life and social survival, thus the physical education community bears the mission of continuing the life of the nation. Given the great responsibility, efforts should be made to improve and research physical education in order to adapt to the national conditions. To adapt to the national conditions, it is necessary to first determine the goals, enhance the effects, and at the same time adapt to the world trend and social needs, consider the national finances, and then it can save the party and the country from danger. Changhe has many observations during his years of research in the United States. He will briefly list a few points based on his research findings for the reference of the people and colleagues in the physical education community.</p>
<p>Saving Useless Waste and Engaging in Practical Construction</p>
<p>Years of natural disasters, communist bandits, and the pressure of strong neighbors have led to national distress and poverty. At this time, saving the people and defending the country require urgent funds. Therefore, all national expenditures should be based on saving. The development of physical education is the same. Physical education in our country overemphasizes formality, so there is a lot of useless waste. Each sports event costs tens of thousands of gold, or at least thousands of gold. If we find ways to save money and use it to build solid and practical sports fields, how great would the benefits be to the people and the future of physical education? Therefore, I believe that all kinds of sports events in the future should fundamentally promote the spirit of people's sports. All aspects of formality should be based on simplicity and economy. As for the dispatch of athletes, it should also be strictly restricted. World, Far East, national, and various regional sports events, in addition to selecting athletes with special sports achievements, it is absolutely not allowed to hold the idea of having more people attend and observe. The disadvantages of this is not only the high cost, but also hindering the development of the athlete's personal future. Because ordinary athletes will become arrogant after participating in large-scale sports events, and because their results are too poor, they are afraid of being compared by newcomers during training. As a result, they lose the opportunity to compare and improve. Therefore, ordinary athletes are rarely seen in the sports field after attending the conference.</p>
<p>Encouraging Public Donations and Reducing Government Burden</p>
<p>Encouraging donations from people's organizations and reducing the government's burden. The government's finances are in extreme difficulty. The development of social undertakings is huge and complicated, and it is inevitable that some things cannot be done. However, the promotion of social sports cannot be delayed. If we wait until the government has surplus resources to carry it out, it will only waste time and there will never be hope for development. Government authorities and physical education administrators should also actively encourage individuals in provinces, cities, counties, and townships to donate or raise funds to purchase sports venues, so that the government does not spend a penny and the construction of sports fields in provinces, cities, counties, and townships can be restored, as a foundation for popularizing mass sports.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Children's Physical Education as a New Step Towards Popularization</p>
<p>The implementation of children's education should not be delayed, and the guidance of children's physical education is the same. Children are naturally active and we should find ways to increase their interest and cultivate their good habit of being active. Therefore, the implementation of physical education in primary and junior high schools is extremely important. Because of the bad habit of valuing literature over military skills in our country for thousands of years, a group of parents and elders call their children who are active "naughty" and regard them as bad children. Therefore, a group of children not only cannot increase their innate habit of being active, but also retreat. This is the biggest obstacle to physical education in our country and needs to be corrected. In the future, if we want to revive the nation, we must first create healthy citizens, and to create healthy citizens, we must increase children's habit of exercise. In the future, when they enter schools at all levels or serve the society, their habit of loving exercise can continue to be maintained, their physical health can be improved, and the goal of popularization can be easily achieved, and the nation can be strong.</p>
<p>Training Focuses on Methods, Practice Focuses on Perseverance</p>
<p>There are many exercise methods, and the posture is also easy to change. The selection method must be based on the principles of mechanics and expert experience. During training, the mechanical method of each segment of exercise should be explained and demonstrated in detail, so that students can understand and increase their faith. To improve the results, it is not the work of one morning or evening, but requires a spirit of hard work and endurance. Perseverance can be effective. Athletes in our country often suffer from the disease of temporary efforts, so it is difficult to improve their results. In addition, exercising is like eating one full meal and then starving for ten, which is too much and not enough. The body is most easily injured, and the studies are also abandoned. It is not only useless, but also harmful. Therefore, to promote physical education in the future, we must correct the past methods in order to achieve the effectiveness of regular training.</p>
<p>Textbooks Based on Practicality, Objectives Adapt to National Conditions</p>
<p>Sports textbooks and objectives are greatly related to the value of physical education. Therefore, their selection must be based on national conditions in order to adapt to the needs of national character, and attention must be paid to age when implementing them. For example, children's physical education should be trained with teaching materials that include patriotic thoughts and lively games. Morality, discipline, obedience, mutual assistance, cooperation, and national character are the foundations for training children's virtues. In addition to increasing the above teaching materials for training in middle school and university physical education, practical teaching materials with larger amounts of exercise, including courage, endurance, risk avoidance, and other practical skills should be implemented. As for social and rural physical education, more attention should be paid to the economic situation, adapted to special needs, and given appropriate organization to serve as the basis for accepting military training, and more knowledge such as transportation and first aid should be instilled to prepare them for future military citizens.</p>
<p>Concentrate Specialized Talents and Expand Teacher Training Schools</p>
<p>Physical education in our country is bound to become more popular, so the number of physical education teachers at all levels and social and rural physical education service personnel will be even greater, and there is a great lack of higher physical education teachers. It is best to concentrate specialized talents (such as the National Academy of Physical Education), expand the organization of teacher training schools, and train physical education teachers across the country in one place. If this can be done, not only can expenses be saved, but also achievements can be improved, and the boundaries of factions can be broken, the steps can be unified, and the advancement can be made in the same direction. Since cooperation is easy, it can naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is the only way to save the excessive transition of higher physical education teachers. The content and organization are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Boy Scout Group can be divided into junior high school and high school levels to train elementary school and junior high school social coaches.</p>
<p>(2) National Martial Arts Group can be divided into junior high school, high school, and university levels to train elementary school, high school, social, and university teachers.</p>
<p>(3) Military and Police Physical Education Group can be divided into high school and university levels to train teachers in the military, police, and military and police schools.</p>
<p>(4) Popular Physical Education Group</p>
<p>A. Junior High School Department is designed to meet the current needs of rural physical education teachers and take into account the rural economic situation. Therefore, its level can be lowered and the length of schooling can be shortened, so that it can accept lower-level promotion of rural physical education in the future.</p>
<p>B. Intermediate Department Senior high school and normal school qualifications to train junior high school elementary school teachers and social physical education instructors.</p>
<p>C. Advanced Department Trains high school teachers, social physical education administrators, and university assistant teachers with university-level degrees.</p>
<p>(5) Research Group is prepared for the Boy Scout, National Martial Arts, Military and Police Physical Education, and General Physical Education Groups. University graduates with specialized degrees conduct advanced specialized research to train experts in various subjects and physical education administrators.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Lan Shan)</p>
<p>Su Shi's poem says: "I do not know the true face of Mount Lu, because I am in the mountain." These two sentences are rich in philosophy and thought-provoking. Those who are addicted to opium think that lying on a couch, exhaling clouds and spitting fog, is infinitely interesting. But in the eyes of others, they only see a skeleton lying diagonally on a corpse bed. "Being clear when criticizing others, and being obscure when criticizing oneself" is something that people have in common throughout the ages. The reason for this is that it is easier to see others clearly, and it is not easy to see oneself, just like being in Mount Lu and not seeing the true face of Mount Lu, which is the same principle.</p>
<p>A person is originally like a crystal clear white jade. When they do something bad, it is like a drop of black ink staining the jade. If they can immediately correct their mistakes, the ink will be washed away, and it will still be a piece of white jade. If they continue to stain it without washing it, the white jade will one day become completely black.</p>
<p>Young people have the most fantasies, middle-aged people are unwilling to fantasize, and old people have no fantasies at all. This is because the degree of experiencing reality is different. Therefore, reality can often break people's fantasies.</p>
<p>The friends we need are those who often visit when you are frustrated, giving you comfort and help. Those who come to flatter you when you are successful may not be good friends.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Issue of Sharing Food</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter and hotter, and people should pay extra attention to hygiene! Every summer, this city holds a hygiene campaign, which is to advise the public to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene in everything in life. However, I think the issue of "food" is even more important, because the ancients had the adage "disease enters through the mouth." Therefore, in this hot weather, many people are vegetarians. However, I think the issue of "sharing food" is also worth discussing, because Chinese people eat together at every meal, and several bowls of dishes are placed on the table. Everyone picks up their chopsticks and stirs them in the vegetable bowl, and then sends them to their mouths. In this cycle, the vegetable bowl is soon covered with everyone's saliva. If someone at the table has sores, it is easy to spread through the chopsticks. Moreover, this issue was also proposed last summer. At that time, some people advocated using two pairs of chopsticks to pick up vegetables, while others advocated using separate bowls for each person to hold the dishes. However, Chinese people's habits are deeply ingrained, and it is very difficult to change them for a while! The reasons for opposition and refutation are that using two pairs of chopsticks to pick up vegetables is troublesome, and if everyone uses bowls to hold the dishes, each person will need more than two pairs of bowls. If the whole table is counted as eight people, it will be a grand bowl and dish exercise, which is unsightly! Now I have come up with a strategy that is both hygienic and does not hinder the appearance, that is, to prepare one set of dishes, rice, and bowls for each person. However, the vegetable bowl must be slightly larger and divided into compartments, like a painter's palette, to divide the dishes. Wouldn't that be great! This is my humble opinion, whether it is feasible or not depends on everyone's advocacy.</p>
<h3>Yang Guilu</h3>
<p>— Wan Mu</p>
<p>In March and April, when you walk into the mountains of Ma埠, Liu'an, the first thing that makes you feel extremely comfortable is the various ingenious bird sounds, singing all kinds of different tunes. Among them, there is a kind called "Yang Guilu." Its voice is sad and melodious, a bit like a oriole. All day long, it cries "Yang Guilu, Yang Guilu" without resting for a moment. Especially in drizzling weather or a hazy moonlit night, its cry is particularly mournful. If you are far away from your hometown and come to Ma埠 alone to visit the tea mountain scenery, no matter how happy you are, you will be called away by it, feeling sad, desolate, empty, and lonely, making you homesick. This kind of bird sound does not exist in other places.</p>
<p>The story about "Yang Guilu" is said to be like this: Yang Guilu was a Shandong native. Not long after he married his wife, he envied the prosperity of Ma埠's tea season, so he abandoned his beloved wife and went to Ma埠 to visit. The prosperity of Ma埠's tea season has always been famous. The tea-picking girls all over the mountains sing graceful and charming tea-picking songs, with emerald sleeves and red skirts, and tender green tea trees and colorful mountain azaleas, reflecting each other in the warm weather of nature, which is so intoxicating! Yang Guilu indulged in it and died of illness in less than two months. His beloved wife, because he had been out of contact for a long time, came to Ma埠 from thousands of miles away to find her husband. When she arrived in Ma埠, Yang Guilu was already dead. She wailed all day long at a pile of yellow earth and turned into a bird, still crying sadly all day and night. Even now, as soon as the tea season arrives, there is its mournful tone.</p>

<h3>A Joking Talk on Magic</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Shanghai society seems to be a base camp for magic troupes? The general magicians with superb skills, their thinking is agile, and their methods are brilliant. In a while, they can conjure up many colorful banknotes from two empty hands, and in a while, they can conjure up tall Western-style houses, new cars, and modern beauties. They can conjure up whatever they want. They can get whatever they want, as easy as turning their hands. It is really transplanting flowers and grafting trees, with endless changes!</p>
<p>There is also a kind of hypnotic magic, which is also very mysterious. If you want to sleep, it can immediately make you sleepwalk into the land of black sweetness. If you want to walk, you walk. If you want to sit, you sit. No soul is not under his command, not listening to his orders. This kind of hypnotism is similar to magic, with the same wonderful effect!</p>
<p>Those actors with immature magic skills can only conjure up things that are not very clever. And they come and go quickly, like fleeting clouds, like a flash in the pan, making people dizzy. Sometimes, if they are not careful, they are seen through by the audience, and the audience under the stage will not loudly boo them, right?</p>
<p>There are also a group of trainees in the newly established magic troupe. They can only do some semi-true and semi-false farces, wearing masks, wearing strange costumes, and holding a stick. You scold me, you cheat me, you hit me, you kick me. They are all-powerful and skillful. Although these actors can only do those sneaky things, the great magicians cannot help but rely on these assistants!</p>
<p>However, magic also requires magic talent. If people without magic talent insist on learning magic, then they will inevitably make many jokes. Maybe someone will think they are suffering from mental illness!</p>

<p>The director left a sentence, asking me to go again at three o'clock. He met me and said a lot of apologies, how could I blame him? So today I was just busy serving the two directors, and did not pay attention to this matter of writing a letter to you. Huanhua said, then, congratulations to you, you will soon have a job. Jie Fu smiled and said: I also congratulate you, you can now return to Jiangnan. Relying on this letter of mine, not to mention how much money, but the small train fare from Nanjing to Shanghai, my friend can always send you. Go to my room, and I will write a letter to you right away. Saying that, he stretched out a hand behind Huanhua, pretending to help him. Huanhua said: Writing a letter is not in a hurry, it is still Mr. Jia who promised to give me the money, but it has not been taken out yet, I want to ask Mr. Zhang to urge him. I will come to Mr. Zhang's room again tonight. Jie Fu looked at him and smiled: Are you sure you can come? Huanhua said: How dare I deceive you? Jie Fu laughed and left. Huanhua nodded to Zhiqian, did not come in, and left on his own. In less than two minutes, I heard a bang in the next room, a sound of hitting the table, and Li Shilian cursed: In this year, as long as you are shameless, you can eat. In order to ask someone for a letter, doing things like matchmaking for pimps, all done. Jia Duocai is too ungrateful, too blind, and giving such people a letter of introduction. Saying that, he heard the teacup being put down heavily again. Zhiqian was stunned, and smiled unconsciously. Shilian said from the next room: Mr. Cheng, did you hear Zhang Jiefu's bragging? Opening his mouth is director, closing his mouth is director, I really feel sick for him. (273)</p>
<h3>Fragrant Records of the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As for the third point, the situation is different from before! Nowadays, whether officials or civilians, they can marry concubines very casually; (Translator's note: The situation is different after the new criminal law stipulates that anyone who marries a concubine will be imprisoned). In the past, although officials were more eager to marry concubines than they are today, there was a restriction. If all the concubines they married were selected from among the slaves, or bought from small families and brothels, then no matter how many they married, no one could criticize them. What was prohibited was only forcing women from good families to be concubines.</p>
<p>While the Empress Dowager was reviewing the documents brought by Prince Qing one by one, I silently recalled behind her: I remember how painful my father was mentally when the Empress Dowager appointed several senior officials to go to Guangdong to investigate this lawsuit; because he happened to be appointed as one of the investigating officials, and even more unfortunately, he was very friendly with the accused governor, and could be regarded as a close friend. Of course, my father had nothing to do with the various charges against him. He neither colluded with him to commit fraud, nor would he deliberately cover up for him; but after he knew that his friend had been accused of such serious charges, he could not help but feel very sad. Fortunately, things would not be too embarrassing; although my father could not openly resist the Empress Dowager's decree and hide at home without investigating, he was happy that the Empress Dowager did not appoint him as the leader of the investigating officials, but only asked him to be an ordinary member, so things would be easier to handle! Unexpectedly, after taking a trip to Guangdong, he felt even more troubled; because the facts had been clearly investigated, and he told us privately at home that all the accusations against the governor had been completely proven to be true, and even many bad deeds that had not been included in the charges had also been discovered. So my father was really worried about him. (373)</p>
<h3>Types of Watermelons</h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>Time flies quickly, and it is already the hot summer of June again. The fire-like sun shines in the sky, and watermelons are born in season again, becoming a wonderful product to relieve heat and quench thirst. There are many places where watermelons are produced, and there are also small varieties. There are very good watermelons produced in both the north and south of the Yangtze River. In the Jiangnan area, the most famous ones are the following.</p>
<p>The watermelons produced in Changshu have a kind of snow hook melon. The color of the skin is flower green stripes, the flesh is white, and the seeds are ocher red. The jade-like white flesh is set off by the ocher red seeds, making it even more bright and eye-catching. The sweet juice is also abundant, as fresh and clean as honey. It can be called the best of watermelons, but the annual production is very small. Except for the locals in Changshu, very few people have tasted this delicacy.</p>
<p>Lian Tang, Qingpu, produces a kind of three white melon. The flesh is also white jade color, but the seeds are butterfly seeds, which are white seeds with two black dots. The reason why it is called three white is because the skin is white, the flesh is white, and the seeds are white. The sweetness is also fresh and clean, no less than Changshu snow hook.</p>
<p>The watermelons produced in this place have a special name in the capital. Anyone who likes watermelons knows about them. In addition, Chongming has a kind of black-skinned watermelon with fire yellow flesh, which is also very sweet and clean. Various villages in Suzhou produce watermelons with white flesh and yellow flesh, but the taste is not as good as Changshu and Lian Tang.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dezhou watermelons, I am afraid that everyone knows that they are produced in Dezhou, Shandong. It is a kind of pillow-shaped watermelon, each weighing about ten kilograms. The colors of the flesh are yellow and red. The taste is better than the watermelons produced in Jiangnan. Except for Hami melons, no place can beat it, so it is famous throughout the country and occupies an important position in the fruits produced in Shandong.</p>
<p>The watermelons in our country were all brought from Hami. The watermelons produced in Hami are said to be the best in the country by those who have tasted them. The author has not tasted them, so I dare not guess. It is only because the transportation in Xinjiang Hami is much more convenient than before, and many government officials go there, so they taste Hami melons as exotic flavors. The taste of the melons is naturally good.</p>
<p>Because of the different places of origin of watermelons, their weight, skin color, and flesh color are also different. Most of the largest watermelons weigh twenty or thirty kilograms, and the smallest weigh four or five kilograms. Smaller ones cannot be eaten. The color of the melon skin includes deep green flower, light green flower, black skin, white skin, pheasant skin, and other types. The color of the melon flesh is mostly red, fire yellow, and white. There are also pink, light yellow, and peach red, but red, yellow, and white are the original colors of watermelons, and light yellow, pink, and other colors are variants. There are also three types of melon seeds: butterfly seeds, which are white with two red or black dots on the head; sandalwood seeds, which are ocher red; and black seeds. Generally, white-fleshed watermelons have butterfly seeds, only Changshu is an exception. Fire yellow and red-fleshed watermelons have sandalwood seeds and black seeds.</p>
<p>People who are experienced in watermelon types can know the color of the melon flesh at a glance at the color of the melon skin. Almost light-flowered skins are white flesh, and deep-flowered skins and black skins are fire yellow and red. White skins are also mostly white flesh, and pheasant skins have both red and white. However, Changshu snow hook is a deep green-flowered skin with white flesh, so you cannot distinguish the melon flesh by experience alone. This also requires people with experience in watermelon types to have this ability to distinguish!</p>

<h3>Securities: Securities Market Immediately Turns Bearish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly turned bearish. This was not due to a short squeeze. The previous aggressive increases by No. 48 and others went against the environmental situation. At a time of financial depletion and public panic, it was not enough to stimulate a declining public spirit. The fleeting moment was expected. As table positions slightly tightened, sellers suddenly emerged. Nos. 4, 14, and 53 were gradually increasing, and gold short selling was particularly active. The future is not optimistic. If this leads to a short squeeze, the downturn will be even more severe. Yesterday, the leaders first raised the issue of streamlining to obscure the view, and then sold off each item. The overall trend was relatively stable for the consolidated tax. From the time Nos. 4 and others sold gold short, the downturn gradually began, and public confidence turned downward, retracing a small three or four corners along the way. The situation in the second session was flat in the front. After entering, it became increasingly severe. Gold short selling fell by 6.5 corners. The situation at 96 also gradually became powerless. However, No. 53 was still buying in, persistent to the end. As a result, except for the streamlining of this month, which rose by one corner, the rest generally fell by two, three, or nine corners. The total transaction volume was 16,654,500 yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<p>Steel Stocks Rise Most Sharply</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Sin Feng Foreign Trade Co. reported yesterday (the 22nd) that steel stock prices at the New York Stock Exchange soared, rising to their highest point of the year. The entire city followed suit. Prices also rose in the minor exchange, except for a small number of utility stocks and sugar stocks. The bond market saw mixed ups and downs. Prices of high-grade corporate bonds rose. Today's transaction volume was 1.37 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Futures Driven by Spot Sales</h3>
<p>Spot Sales Remain Strong, Production Limited, Inventory Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>The yarn market is doing well due to decent spot yarn sales. Many yarn mills have suspended operations, reducing production. At the same time, yarn inventory has decreased sharply, so most people are leaning towards a bullish position and are optimistic about bid yarn. However, a certain major account is selling off during the rise, reportedly in a very large amount. However, the number of chips is dwindling daily, and cotton yarn is gradually entering a stable state. The fundamental key still depends on spot sales.</p>
<h3>Bid Yarn Near-Term Drops, Distant-Term Rises</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of the bid yarn market, near-month contracts were weak due to rumors of a major account having delivery pressure. This month fell by one yuan and August fell by 0.4 yuan. It turned firm in the middle of the month, rising several corners. Distant-month contracts were flat again. The first session was still flat. At the third closing, spot yarn trading was good, and the distant-month contracts suddenly became hot, with eager buyers. As a result, this month fell by one corner compared to the previous day's closing price, August was stable, and distant-month contracts rose by 0.8 to 1.1 yuan. It was found that Tongji sold 350 bales, Mingde 450 bales, Junchang 550 bales, Changyu 550 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Taichang 450 bales, and Dachang 300 bales.

<p>Yunnan: 10</p>
<p>Peers: 5</p>
<p>Bid Cotton Distant-Month Longs Rollover Positions</p>
<p>The cotton market was slightly softer this month because the rise had been too aggressive. According to the market, a certain Tongzhou factory had thousands of dan of Tongzhou cotton coming to Shanghai for delivery. More than 100 dan of the goods that passed the cotton inspection were already available, so the market price fell slightly this month. However, the distant-month contracts were firm, probably due to longs rolling over positions.</p>
<p>Bid Cotton Near-Month Drops</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the bid cotton market, a certain Tongzhou factory had Tong cotton coming to Shanghai for delivery, Daf sold off, and the market was loose, sluggish, and weak. The distant-month contracts followed. However, the number of contracts traded for the August contract had accumulated to 200,000 dan, an increase of over 10,000 dan compared to the previous day, indicating that the longs were deliberately accumulating positions. The second session was stable, and market prices rose slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The closing price suddenly rose, with a strong bullish trend. It was rumored that a certain direction was making large purchases. However, after careful investigation after the closing, general cotton merchants were seen with some accounts exiting and others entering, creating a confusing situation, probably to rollover distant dates, only the August dates were high. As a result, this month fell by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, with the remaining prices rising by 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.15 yuan. It was found that Daf sold 2,000 dan, Dafeng 1,700 dan, Chang 2,600 dan, Junchang 2,700 dan, Changcheng 1,000 dan, Shengyuan 2,100 dan, Yuanda 900 dan, Yichang 900 dan, Xincheng 1,200 dan, and Chang 4,600 dan.

<p>Overseas Cotton Market Rebounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with mixed conditions, with all months rising and falling by one to two pounds. Near-month spot traders sold off and longs closed out, while foreign traders bought distant-month contracts. Later, peers and brokers bought, there were not many sellers, and market prices rose. And hear the government sell July in New Orleans, market price soft. Weather and cotton harvests are both favorable. The spot and textile markets are quiet and firm. The Cotton Exchange Office said that domestic consumption plus exports amounted to approximately 10,025,000 bales, the smallest number in 30 years. It also estimated that the US cotton overseas inventory for this season was approximately 1 million bales less than last year. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising by five pounds and futures prices rising by two to ten pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by one point and futures prices rose to three points. Indian cotton was weak due to sales by Japanese and European exporters, but it was absorbed by market operators. The average price of Pogar rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Ormura rose by 0.5 to 1.5 rupees, and Bilo Creek rose by 0.25 to half a rupee. The original telegrams are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Hedging Has Been Discovered in Indian Cotton Last Week</p>
<p>Futures changes were minimal last week. There was a lack of selling pressure, and reduced inventories were enough to prevent activity. Cross-selling and hedging have been discovered, but this purchase of spot hedging is negligible. Most people are still bullish, and foreign inquiries are also rare due to the wide difference in prices. Weather conditions are generally favorable. Rainfall and air volume are moderate, which is conducive to cotton harvesting. The weekly statistics are attached below: (unit: thousand bales)</p>
<p>Data for 1934 and 1935</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1: 2,314.6 - 2,401</p>
<p>Spot Inventory at Weekend: 978 - 632</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1: 1,392 - 1,517</p>
<p>Exports to Europe: 369 - 362</p>
<p>Exports to China: 155 - 79</p>

<p>Exports to Other Regions: 19 - 30</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: Flour Prices Rise, Wheat Market Oscillates, Wheat Bran Exports and Domestic Sales Both Active</h3>
<p>Initially, the flour market was stable, but then it surged. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago, down a little over one cent for near-term, down two cents for deferred; Canada, up a quarter cent or so. Market sentiment: initially, people thought foreign wheat fluctuations were minimal and activity scarce, but then major factories gradually covered their positions for the current month, and customers also prepared to draw and load, causing the market to gradually tighten. For deferred months, there were also rumors about currency issues and talk of price controls, so buying interest was also brisk. However, in reality, factories covering their positions for the current month led to purchases from outside the industry. As for currency rumors, it is feared that the time is not yet right. As a result, the current month rose one and a half cents, August rose two cents, September rose two and one-eighth cents, October rose two cents, November rose one and a half cents, and December rose two and two-eighths cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market generally presented a state of oscillation and stability, because foreign wheat quotations fluctuated very little. Although the current month had abundant spot goods on the market, the current conditions in various producing areas made it impossible to reconcile. Therefore, customers naturally sold very little short. Industry insiders also came and went casually, without much enthusiasm. Therefore, asking prices were relatively stable, and deferred trading was still active, with little change in the market. Future developments will likely depend on the flour market. As a result, the current month was up a quarter cent, August was up one cent, September and October were unchanged, and November was down a little over one cent. In the afternoon, Da Fu also suspended auctions, and the market was notified from the 23rd to August 8th. Currently, wheat prices on the market are not cheap in the producing areas, and customers are unwilling to sell. Asking prices at all stalls have increased by three cents. It is said that Shandong Yanghe Yaowan wheat is selling for 3.515 cents, followed by 4.2 cents; Wuhe wheat is selling for 3.389 cents; Liuhe wheat is selling for 3.15 cents, followed by 3.3 cents; Yangzhou wheat is selling for 3.15 cents; Danyang wheat is selling for 3.3 cents; Coupei wheat is selling for 3.27 cents, followed by 3.35 cents; Wuyi wheat is selling for 3.36 cents; Nanjing wheat is selling for 3.17 cents, followed by 3.25 cents; Jiangxinzhou wheat is selling for 3.15 cents; Puzhen wheat is selling for 3.19 cents. Six thousand bags were shipped from Fuxin and one thousand bags each from Fufeng and Xinhuo.</p>
<p>Reports of black spots on overseas wheat have decreased. Purchases on the market seem slightly excessive. This week, the supply is expected to increase by 1,800,400 dan.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: July 20th vs. October 172nd, Fluctuations</p>
<p>September: 85.875 vs. 85.50, Down 0.35</p>
<p>December: 86.75 vs. 87.25, Up 0.375</p>
<p>Spot: 92.20 vs. 97.125, Up 2.875</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>August: 80.75 vs. 80.875, Up 0.25</p>
<p>The wheat bran market: recently, because all factories had thick inventories, Shanghai factories alone had an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 bags, so people were watching production and asking prices. It is said that the market has tightened. Fuxin is asking 2.025 yuan, Fufeng bran is asking 1.90 yuan, and others are similar. The above are all wholesale prices. If foreign merchants continue to operate, the market is expected to remain stable.</p>
<h3>No Rice Escapes Rising Prices, Whether Domestic or Foreign</h3>
<p>The source of this rice (Shanghai South) yesterday was still only up to the 13th or 14th (a total of 2,600 to 2,700 shi).浦积 was not abundant, and people hesitated. Then it became stable. Sales on the street were relatively strong, and the situation was tight. As a result, the price of all 梗 rice increased by 10 to 20 cents. Although the demand for 薄稻 was only a hundred or so bags, the price also increased by a dime or so. Du Jian rice was slightly fresh, and the price of cloudy rice was元無市. Yesterday (Shanghai North), there were 13 or 14 ships from 河下. Although retail sales of various goods such as 河存白粳 were normal in the market, because there were few 河存, the price increased by 30 cents again. The retail price of 薄稻 was active, and the price increased by 10 to 20 cents. Bai Yuan rice sold well, priced at 40 cents apart. The price of other goods also increased by a dime or more.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market is continuing to be active and even more prosperous than yesterday. Yesterday, actual sales to 長江帮 and inland areas outside Zhejiang East by Japanese customers were strong, and new囤戸s also inquired. Therefore, transactions were quite lively. The total number of transactions for the whole day exceeded 10,000 again, including 11,000 bags of Saigon rice and more than 2,000 bags of small 絞安南粳暹邏 rice, etc. As inventories dwindled daily and all orders had arrived, people's sentiment was upward. The price was 5 to 6 cents, 1 dime, or 1.5 to 2 dimes higher than the previous market. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, market prices may need to increase gradually.</p>
<h3>Shantou Brokers Buy 100,000 Bean Cakes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bean cake market was stable but weak due to strong buying by Shantou brokers. A total of 28,000 pieces of current cake from various factories' four brands were opened, priced from 1.90 to 2.60 yuan. In addition, more than 48,000 pieces of return cake from various factories were ordered for delivery on the 26th and 27th, priced from 1.285 to 2.60 yuan. An additional 3,000 pieces were ordered for delivery at the end of the month, priced at 1.27 yuan. 13,000 pieces of four-brand cake from Wuxi Factory were ordered for delivery in early August, priced at 1.555 yuan. A total of more than 5,000 pieces of 客饼 were also traded. With strong sales of yellow beans in cake form, factory demand revived, so the market saw a decline. A total of 3,600 to 3,700 bags of various beans were traded in the city, and the price was 10 cents lower than the previous market. In addition, 13 cars of Siping Street beans were purchased, and there were scattered inquiries in the rest of the street, opening 100 or so bags of Kaiyuan Tieling beans and one car of Fanjiatun beans.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Refined Cotton Red Sugar Rebounds</h3>
<p>Domestic refined cotton red sugar has recently become looser due to increased arrivals, but since the continuous openings, inventories have gradually thinned, and sales are still active. Yesterday's market suddenly rebounded by 35 cents, opening at more than 100, with the higher priced ones at 11.10 to 11 yuan, and the ordinary ones at 10.85 yuan. The guild's wholesale price for 14 coarse sand white spot goods was 16.15 yuan, with 100 to 200 bags traded, unchanged. Taikoo Sugar B mark, which was offered at 17.50 yuan the day before yesterday but not traded, was traded at 17.58 yuan for 90 bags yesterday, and later no one was willing to sell.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Fungus Prices Rise Again by Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>Hankou fungus is in short supply, and demand exceeds supply, so the price suddenly increased by eight yuan, reaching 98 yuan. Goods en route are expected to arrive at the end of the month, and the trend remains tight.</p>
<h3>Peanut Forecasts Suggest Only 30% Harvest</h3>
<p>According to visitors from Xuzhou yesterday, the peanut crop in Shandong, Henan, and other producing areas was affected by unfavorable weather before planting, and the harvest this year is bound to be greatly reduced, estimated to be only 30%. Therefore, Chen Shengren has recently shown signs of tightness, and we will see what the final result will be.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Both Red and Green Tea Trading is Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in red tea from Qimen and Fuliang and green tea from Luzhuang Pingshui Tuzhuang and other areas was sluggish. British firms such as Xiehe Jinlong and others mostly refrained from buying more Qimen red tea and Zhenmei green tea, which were expensive, because the silver price abroad fluctuated and exchange rates rose and fell unpredictably. Therefore, high-end Zhenmei with抽芯 priced at over 100 yuan关外, saw no inquiries. Yesterday's market only saw the sale of 400 or so boxes of Yichang red tea, and 1,030 boxes of green tea such as Zhenmei Fengmei Gongxi ordinary Zhenmei. Because Chinese merchants' attitudes were firm, selling prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Textiles: New Autumn and Winter Goods Seem to Appear</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market remains sluggish. The trend in the Public Welfare Association market is scattered and idle. Both retail and wholesale transactions are deserted. Because the prices of various goods have reached the bottom, there is little fluctuation. Although the prices of new autumn and winter goods have not yet officially opened, judging from the market situation, there seems to be a trend of improvement. Insiders say that not many goods have arrived, and關金 and foreign exchange rates have increased. Yesterday, most of the Western goods at the Palace were still selling for 3.30 to 3.40 yuan, Eastern goods were 2.70 to 2.80 yuan, Western goods 黄　纹 were 50 cents, Eastern goods were 40 cents, Western goods 黄呢 were selling for 2.30 to 2.40 yuan, Eastern goods were 2 yuan per corner, and domestic Zhanghua Wei was 2.85 yuan and Renli was 2.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: German Huisi Iron Shows Unique Strength</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of German Huisi iron have become active, and customers and users are quite active. Since the day before yesterday, a total of 600 to 700 boxes have been opened, and the price is 26.75 yuan per box. However, the spot price for retail transactions is still 27.50 yuan. Moreover, the foreign exchange rate is trending tight, so the market outlook has the potential to improve further.</p>

<h3>Merchant Novels of the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Hanfeng</p>
<p>Probably because the intellectual class and merchants were not very close, and "merchant" was ranked last among the four classes of people, novels about merchants have been rarely seen throughout history. Among the long novels written by modern people, we only have Mao Dun's "Midnight," and in the late Qing Dynasty, there was only Ji Wen's "Sounds of the City." Although there were works like "Records of the Strange Phenomena of the Business World" in the late Qing Dynasty, they were actually insignificant. Those Wu dialect novels that also write about merchants but actually only want to write about brothel life have even less reason to be regarded as merchant novels.</p>
<p>When I started reading "Sounds of the City," I had high hopes because the book opened with a millionaire who wanted to use all of his wealth to revitalize Chinese industry to resist foreign goods, and the conversations of many characters focused on this point. I seemed quite confident that I could see the visage of the increasingly urgent Sino-foreign commercial war in this picture, although I also certainly believed that the result would inevitably be failure.</p>
<p>If Ji Wen had truly grasped this main thread and continued to write around this center without ever deviating, then "Sounds of the City" would have truly become a remarkable book, a special literary work, and a very precious social historical material with even greater power. However, I never expected that immediately after touching this aspect, he would immediately slip away and develop into the description of another matter. Later, he certainly continued to write about this character intermittently, but what he wrote was actually another aspect: how some bad subordinates were lining their own pockets in various ways, causing him to fail. He never said anything about the "war" at all.</p>
<p>The author's purpose was simply to expose how a group of merchants at the time were doing some outrageous things under the beautiful name of "revitalizing industry and commerce" to make themselves rich and then fail. The writing method is quite similar to other satirical novels. "His recounting of events begins and ends with one person, or rather, ends with that person. He writes about a big wealthy person's money intermittently, sometimes there and sometimes not. The main focus is on silk cocoon merchants, tea merchants, silk merchants, real estate brokers, and wealthy children and big schemers who want to engage in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Therefore, what can be seen in "Sounds of the City," in addition to the activities of these characters who are not "true merchants," are only a few concepts related to the commercial situation at the time and the process of Chinese commerce losing out under foreign capital. Naturally, the trend of Shanghai's prosperity can also be seen, but that is also not much.</p>
<p>For example, regarding foreign silk manipulating the silk market: "Foreign silk is increasing year by year. What hope do Chinese merchants have? When they set a price, they don't care if you follow it or not. I've seen through the problems; I'm afraid it will only go down" (words of silk cocoon broker Wu Yuepo, volume one, page 46). For example, regarding the tea industry: "Now, China's tea industry is declining day by day. The reason is that India and Ceylon produce more tea. They have companies, and the company sends people to supervise everything from planting to picking. Moreover, their tea is made by machine, and foreigners like to drink this kind, only feeling that Chinese tea has no taste. I remember that a dozen years ago, China's tea exports amounted to more than 1.889 million dan, but later it was only '1.2 million dan. It is gradually decreasing. What color do tea merchants have?" (words of Ou Qishan, who wants to revitalize the tea industry, page 50). Only in these places can we glimpse the gradually declining situation.</p>
<p>"Implement commercial warfare." Many people with lofty ideals thought so, and they ran around calling for it, took out money, and had many practical plans to transform "handicrafts" into "machinery," such as the wealthy merchant from Yangzhou who wanted to "bring Western machinery to weave various novel silk fabrics and other things to seize the business of silk cloth imported from foreign countries" (page 52), and Dai Shan's plan to improve the tea industry (page 79). But what was the result? The economy was exhausted, the business was not successful, and they were all tricked by some brokers and subordinates using new slang and slogans, who lined their own pockets and squandered everything. Qian Bolian and Wang Buqing can be representatives of these characters.</p>
<p>Ji Wen's intention seems to be: China's industry and commerce are declining day by day, and there is no way out without revitalization. Those who hold such high hopes and invest great wealth are not without their people, such as a wealthy merchant in Yangzhou and a magnate in Guangdong. However, Chinese merchants lack commercial ethics too much, do not think about business too much, only know how to line their own pockets, only know how to engage in rampant prostitution and gambling, so that nothing is accomplished, making those who are interested also hesitate to move forward. He exposes all of this to attract everyone's attention, hoping for some reforms.</p>
<p>Although it is the author's complete freedom to choose whatever theme he wants, it is still a regrettable thing that not even a glimpse of the commercial war can be seen in the only novel from the late Qing Dynasty. Only seeing the wind and not the rain cannot be said to be a regret. On this point, Mao Dun's "Midnight" is truly a work worthy of pride. And "Sounds of the City" cannot be said to be higher than "Emotions prevail over none."</p>
<p>The author has quite accomplished the goal he wanted to achieve. The characters Qian Bolian and Zhu Buqing are also written well. However, he also committed the common disease of writers at the time: exaggerated writing and stretching things too far. Writing about Master Shi's donating money for an official position, Mrs. Shi's inviting guests, and Master Xiang's (who made a fortune by selling flowers) family banquet is simply an exaggeration that makes people not believe it. It is "truly written in a humorous and pleasing way," but it is too far from reality. In the works of that time, this is a work at the average level, no matter from which aspect.</p>
<p>This book was first published in "Illustrated Novels," 25 episodes, unfinished. In the 34th year of Guangxu (1908), it was published as a separate book by Commercial Press, two volumes, 36 episodes, complete. Unfortunately, few people paid attention to it at the time. The so-called "Records of the Strange Phenomena of the Business World," a total of two volumes, sixteen episodes, written by Yun Jian Tian Zuisheng and published by the Commercial Association, is an extremely clumsy and insignificant book. The scope of writing is nothing more than the business world and brothels, such as "A telegram arrives, and kerosene soars; a lower hall seeks to leave, and a beautiful person still flaunts" (episode 4); "Applying charms is a common occurrence in happy places, and discussing strange tales in the business world" (episode 8); "Small players want to be unique, and big players issue banknotes" (beginning of episode 16).</p>
<p>However, many novels in the late Qing Dynasty involved merchants, such as the money merchant who handled buying official positions for people in Beijing (Records of the Official World) written by Li Boyuan, and the despicable and vulgar compradors who made a fortune (Secrets to Making a Fortune, etc.) written by Wu Jianren. But no matter what, we have no way of finding a complete picture of commercial activities in the novels of that time. Having the book "Sounds of the City" is already very difficult. Commercial activities should not be neglected like this now. I very much hope that creators can expand in this direction, and that it will not become a thing of the past after "Midnight." In particular, I hope that young people who live in the business world and have literary interests can bravely engage in writing.</p>
<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>I haven't been in Shanghai for a short time, but I haven't been sick. If I were to use the tone of ordinary women, I would be considered one who is "smooth and safe." Indeed! I have this habit. I often grit my teeth to show my spirit of perseverance. I will not show a "young master" appearance of illness because of mental pain or physical weakness, and I will not lie on the bed willfully to show that I am sick. Moreover, some friends suspect that my illness is an inexplicable depression. —But, they can only guess. I will never say why I am sick.</p>
<p>However, real illness has arisen from a chronic depressed mood.</p>
<p>It was at the end of the month. The sky always wore a sorrowful face, and a bleak rain like late autumn fell. My stomach had been empty for two days, and no friends came to see me. I had to run around on the wet streets all day, my tired eyes staring at the scenery. When I was exhausted, I would run home and write articles desperately at the table.</p>
<p>Originally, writing articles desperately was useless, but at this time, writing articles was entirely for the pain of hunger, entirely for mental stimulation. Moreover, especially at this time, there were many thoughts, surging, moving in my brain scene by scene! I had to hold the pen and write desperately, and the more I wrote, the more emotional I became, and the articles I wrote were particularly powerful, fluent, and fast. So, I said to myself with great satisfaction:</p>
<p>"Sickness is not harmful, especially the sickness of hunger will increase my progress." So, I unconsciously became happy and forgot my heartache, forgot the urging for rent, and forgot the long-term hunger in the future. Moreover, I was particularly happy, writing and writing, reading and reading. Everything reached a level of excitement.</p>
<p>But I began to feel dizzy from this illness that spread from pain. I started to feel terribly thirsty, started to feel uncomfortable in my lungs, and started to feel that my stomach was empty and that something was twisting my intestines. So, I threw away the pen and lay quietly on the bed. In the quiet room, I could only hear terrible, short breaths. However, at this time, I could no longer say that I was not sick. Like other people, I could not resist the torment of the illness. My body temperature was sometimes high and sometimes cold, and I was tossing and turning constantly. At night, I still couldn't sleep. I always felt that I had to see a doctor about this illness, but when I mentioned seeing a doctor, I thought that my lungs should also be X-rayed. But what about the money? It was because of hunger that I got sick. I cursed myself like this and blamed money for being the culprit. Isn't that right? Poor people will always suffer like this for the rest of their lives.</p>
<h3>Night in Bashan</h3>
<p>— Duan Weidai</p>
<p>Phosphorescent lights were burning on several desolate graves.</p>
<p>At night, only the sound of mosquitoes could be heard, like a long string of commando teams, launching a general offensive against the two of us in this dilapidated old village.</p>
<p>After every dusk, Old Cook had to tie up me and Yang and take us to a decaying cowshed. This had already become a habitual routine.</p>
<p>During the day, the Run River sobbed. Me and them were all swallowing taro, silently, looking at each other. In addition to resisting a rusty rifle or a weed stalk decorated with red tassels, these hundred or so people were suffering almost the same as me and Yang. They had lice in their hair, no salt to eat, could not defecate, rubbed their blood-red eyes, and almost everyone had pinkeye. They carried their heavy heads, looking at a line of pale green sky, as if they were all expecting a way to survive.</p>
<p>They had completely forgotten that me and Yang were considered hostages.</p>
<p>However, when the sun set and the mosquitoes started to buzz, Old Cook always had to follow the orders of his superiors, supposedly the commander's orders, without any doubt, and tie me and Yang up in that dark, decaying cowshed.</p>
<p>"Old man, do a good deed and trouble yourself to burn some artemisia to drive the mosquitoes away."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, naturally the mosquitoes won't bite us!"</p>
<p>So the smell of artemisia, very strongly, stabbed into people's nostrils, making Yang, a young man who was accustomed to the mixed smell of medicinal oil, pickles, kumquats, and cigarettes, really unable to bear it and sneeze constantly. Old Cook, holding a spear in one hand, quickly took out leaf tobacco, raised his head, and looked at the big moon over the mountains across the river.</p>
<p>"Hey, to be honest, what do you do for a living?"</p>
<p>"Er, to be honest, I'm a teacher at the Wenchang Temple." I silently agreed.</p>
<p>"Oh, then, there's nothing..."</p>
<p>Old Cook sucked on his metal pipe.</p>
<p>This had become a customary routine for several nights.</p>
<p>However, today's dusk was different from before. Flames were rising in various places in the mountains. On a distant mountain peak and in a ravine across the ridge, several gunshots were heard. This was a change that had rarely been seen in the past month or two.</p>
<p>Me and Yang silently sat on the rice straw, letting the mosquitoes buzz around, quietly peeking at the dark, wriggling shadows moving in the courtyard. Under a few dead mulberry trees, the sound of sharpening knives could be heard. They were all moving around in a panic, as if preparing to cope with a very unusual attack. At this moment, there were no guards at the entrance of the cowshed. Neither me nor Yang wanted to run. In reality, the roads in several counties had been cut off and no one was there.</p>
<p>I quietly fell silent.</p>
<p>"What do you do for a living?"</p>
<p>"Teaching."</p>
<p>"Doing business, right? You old man knew it long ago. Hey hey." The small shop assistant interjected.</p>
<p>"Oh, then... then..."</p>
<p>"Then you should let us go."</p>
<p>"Let you go my ass!"</p>
<p>"Hey, what's wrong, old man?"</p>
<p>"I heard, the commander said you two are spies from the other side!"</p>
<p>"What? Er. Really, I'm a teacher. Isn't my life just as hard as yours?"</p>
<p>"Sigh, you don't look like a local. Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Wenchang Temple, two hundred li from here."</p>
<p>"Hmm, you stupid kid, you've said the wrong thing. The commander said to send you off first! Listen, isn't that bugle call ringing over there again?"</p>
<p>Old Cook, carrying his spear, ran to the back of the house in a panic, revealing only a string of wriggling dark shadows.</p>
<p>The firelight had already approached the outside of the commander's camp gate.</p>
<p>"Da di da di da..."</p>
<p>This very clumsy group of bandits, with the stubbornness of farmers, climbed into the green oak forest behind the old village, loaded the iron pellets of their rifles with a clatter, and prepared to fight with the army that came from afar. Because they had no way to survive, fields, cows, grain; they could only rely on their old rifles, weed stalks, and final breaths.</p>
<p>The sky was not yet bright. The stars shone in the empty mountains. The rapids roared. After the gunshots that were randomly fired into the sky had completely died down, their hundred or so people were all surrounded and captured.</p>
<p>Old Cook, carrying a torch, came to release us two hostages. This was another order from the other leader.</p>
<p>"The captain... our captain told you to go! Haha." Old Cook was very enthusiastic in carrying out this new task.</p>
<p>Me and Yang regained our freedom very quickly.</p>
<p>On a very quiet and harmonious night in Bashan, they slowly crawled toward a star of dawn in the south, marching in solemn silence.</p>
<h3>The University Days (29)</h3>
<p>— By German Author Storm, Translated by Chen Yin-Zhi</p>
<p>"Having run like this for a while, 'If the old woman comes out,' I thought, 'she'll be furious!' But she didn't come. At this moment, suddenly, a pigeon flapped its wings and flew across the yard; the horse was startled and jumped. I thought Nellie was definitely going to fall headfirst, but she didn't fall, still clinging to the horse's neck, pale as a corpse with fright. "Aha, Willgini!" the Count called to the horse, already having jumped over, holding Nellie in his arms, gazing at her for a while, then gently letting her down on the ground. My mood hadn't calmed down yet when suddenly the yard gate rang. "The old woman's here!" I thought; but when I turned around, it was the carpenter standing in front of me. If it had been the old woman, I wouldn't have been so flustered! The carpenter stood like a stone statue. "Is it already the night before the festival, Mr. Werner?" I shouted. But he didn't listen to me. "Good evening, Mary!" he said in a completely hoarse voice, as if something was stuck in his throat, choking his words. "Let's go inside the house, shall we?" I said again. "I think," he replied, "you already have someone here." Without looking at the little girl or saying a word to her, he turned around and walked out onto the street through the gate.</p>
<p>"Nellie stood by the panting horse, not moving at all. "What did this man come for?" the Count asked. "He's from my hometown," she replied. "He's Mr. Werner," I said, "the head of the furniture company." The Count's face made me angry; he looked at the carpenter sarcastically.</p>
<p>Mary had just finished a piece of work; she stood up and gathered her clothes into a pile. In the next room, the other tenants were already gathered, ready to sit down for dinner.</p>
<p>"What was the outcome?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What was the outcome?" she repeated my words; "I ran around for a long time, saying a lot of things: finally! The carpenter couldn't leave her, and as for her, if she wasn't crazy, she could understand what relationship this carpenter had with her. Those noble and handsome young masters were not for her!"</p>
<p>We sat down to eat. But the story that lame Mary had just told made me feel very sad. Nellie and Christopher! I couldn't imagine putting these two people together.</p>
<p>A Walk</p>
<p>After Easter, my mother suddenly fell ill and called me home. It wasn't until August that she recovered. I didn't want to leave my father to take care of her alone, so I let the mild air continue to heal her, and I returned to university to study myself. When I set off home, the ice in the wide bay near the university town hadn't completely melted; now the road was lined with lush summer leaves rustling.</p>
<p>This was the second morning after my return; I hadn't visited any friends yet. I stood thoughtfully in the lonely study; the dry ink bottles and dust-covered books stared back at me melancholically; the half-open suitcase on the floor added to this melancholy mood. But the sun shone in through the glass window, enticing me outside; soon I went out, walking alone in the wide, shady avenue under the elm trees; this avenue ran along the seawall beside the sea for a stretch.</p>
<p>The large trees created a kind of gloomy canopy over my head; on both sides of the road, on the leaves, on the grass, and on the windows of the pavilions hidden in the greenery, bright morning sunlight sparkled; sometimes, in places where the trees were sparse, the smooth seawater could reflect in my eyes. I slowly walked forward, taking deep breaths of fresh air; I only met a few strangers on the road, because the time for strolling hadn't arrived yet.</p>

<h3>Suicide is Not Enough to Save the Country</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to a Ningxia dispatch, Mou Fengming, the magistrate of Ningsuo County, recently committed suicide by drowning himself in the river out of grief and indignation over the national crisis. His body has not yet been recovered. He left a suicide note hoping to awaken the people of the country. The note stated: "The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. I cannot bear to see my descendants of the Yellow Emperor become slaves of others. I am willing to commit suicide by drowning to die for my country, to awaken the people of the country. I would rather be a ghost under the knife than a slave of a conquered nation, so that there may be a day when we can strive to save and recover our mountains and rivers."</p>
<p>In our country, in recent years, whenever a national crisis occurs, there are often patriotic people who sacrifice themselves for the country. Magistrate Mou has now also committed suicide by drowning out of grief over national affairs. His ambition is commendable, and his feelings are pitiful, but his attitude is not what we approve of. Our country's national crisis is now at a critical juncture. The plan to save the country and preserve our existence depends on the concerted efforts of all compatriots throughout the country, so that China has hope of revival. Unfortunately, some patriotic people, whenever they are saddened by the daily deterioration of national affairs, become indignant and commit suicide. They do not know that suicide is a passive act that not only does no good to national affairs but also loses the strength of the country. Therefore, since the people of the country are grieved and indignant about the national crisis, they should rise up to save the country, fulfill the responsibilities that every citizen should fulfill, and devote themselves to the country. If everyone were to sacrifice themselves for the country, who would recover from the national crisis?</p>
<p>It is said that Magistrate Mou was a zealous patriot. In recent years, he was pained by the national crisis. Whenever he lamented national affairs with his colleagues, he would recite Yue Wu Mu's "Man Jiang Hong" poem, singing慷慨悲歌 (Kāngkǎi bēi gē; passionate and tragic songs). This year, he took office in Shuoyi, and after only half a year, he worked diligently to govern and love the people, achieving remarkable results. Recently, because of the tense diplomatic situation and the precarious national situation, he shed tears of sadness and became increasingly grieved and indignant, so he decided to commit suicide by drowning to die for his country, hoping to awaken his compatriots. Magistrate Mou's death is indeed a pity. He was a local official who loved his country and his people. If he could change his passive behavior and actively work for the country, the country would benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advise all patriotic compatriots to resolve the national crisis and restore the nation. We rely on our 400 million people to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. Rather than sacrifice ourselves for the country, it is better to keep this useful body and work for the country. We do not hesitate to die, so what cannot be done?</p>
<h3>Master Chen Seven</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Celsius thermometer climbed to its highest point: the village lay in the fiery sun, panting heavily; wild dogs hid in the fences, sticking out their tongues and wagging their tails; the trees wore moldy faces. The dry, earthy smell was carried in the sudden gust of wind and flew everywhere. After a few gusts of wind, followed by a few claps of thunder, the sky suddenly changed: large chunks of clouds floated in from the southeast corner, gathering together to become a mountain-like, massive picture. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and the sun was gone, so the wind continued to blow even harder, and the thunder crashed even louder, with flashes of lightning streaking across the sky. As the cloud cover sank lower and lower, the rain seemed about to fall at any moment. People hid in their houses, hoping that the rain would fall quickly.</p>
<p>However, Master Chen Seven didn't think so. He was afraid that the rain would come again. Rain saved lives for some people, but it would kill him. He stood on the steps of the courtyard, looking at the sky, the dark sky where rain was about to come, looking at the flashes of lightning that flickered before his eyes. He frowned, like a monkey in a hurry, sighing all night. He ran inside, sat down, didn't sit still, then ran outside again, walked around for a while, then turned back in, inexplicably stamping his feet, his face turning purple one moment and green the next.</p>
<p>— "Oh, I shouldn't have been so careless. If this time it rains for a few days like it did last year, then everything will be over."</p>
<p>He muttered to himself endlessly. He remembered that last year, when his grain hoarding business was just about to make a big profit, the unkind heavens sent several days of heavy rain. The fields were full of water, so grain prices plummeted. He not only didn't make a single copper coin, but he even lost all his capital. He hoped he wouldn't run into this bad luck again. He felt a little cold all over. The thunder crashed, and his heart shook. But the thunder seemed deliberately set against him. The more upset he became, the more frequent and louder the thunder crashed.</p>
<p>— "Master, Madam invites you to have dinner. It's getting late."</p>
<p>A little maid called softly from behind. He was already full of anger with nowhere to vent, so this touched his sore spot. Without turning around, he roared and cursed:</p>
<p>— "Bastard, get out of here!" The little maid was caught off guard and walked away in a fright.</p>
<p>Then it was his son's turn to run out:</p>
<p>— "Dad, eat, eat. Mom is calling."</p>
<p>He still scolded loudly in the same way:</p>
<p>Who wants to eat? Your dad is about to die, get out,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Goddammit.</p>
<p>With a "waa" sound, the young, ignorant child cried out. The mother heard the crying and walked out quickly, picking up the child while muttering:</p>
<p>— "Bad mood, taking it out on the son."</p>
<p>The lightning and thunder raged again for a while, and his heart thumped again.</p>
<p>— "It's over, it's over." At this moment, he felt that he was particularly vulnerable and timid.</p>
<p>This time, Master Chen Seven really couldn't avoid being so anxious, because Master Chen Seven's rise to prominence, to the point of opening two general stores on the street that were considered the top shops in this small village town, everyone in the village knew that he made his fortune by hoarding grain. And because the years had generally been bad in recent years, his grain hoarding business almost always made a big profit. Last year, it was an unexpected failure. Fortunately, he hadn't done much business at that time, so although he suffered a blow, it didn't affect his family fortune at all. Since then, he had become particularly bold, always wanting to do it on a large scale, making 18,000, and then retiring to live a leisurely life. In March this year, during the Grain in Ear season, there wasn't a drop of rain for an entire month. The fields were cracked, and no one could plant rice seedlings. Even if they did, they died in the soil. The seedlings that did sprout dried up before long due to lack of moisture. So he seemed very confident, as if he had seen through it, and took out all his property to hoard grain. His golden dream, his lifeline, was entirely invested in it. He felt as if his heart was constantly being lifted up, and his soul was not in his body. He did nothing but send his servants out to inquire about the rise and fall of grain prices. Sometimes, he went out himself in the scorching heat. Fortunately, since the day he fixed his grain hoard, for a month or so, the sky was always a boundless blue, and rain was nowhere to be seen. Only the countryside constantly played the sounds of waterwheels and pumps, seemingly wailing in misery. And when he heard a desperate, cursing tone, saying something like:</p>
<p>— "Damn it, if God doesn't send rain, we're going to die! Who knows, we might starve to death."</p>
<p>This was a welcome piece of news for Master Chen Seven. The more panicked people felt, the more they felt they couldn't survive, the closer he felt his payday was getting. He stroked the thick mustache on his lips, smiling as he murmured to himself:</p>
<p>— "Hmph, didn't see wrong, doing it right, heaven has eyes."</p>
<p>While Master Chen Seven was praising that heaven had eyes, perhaps another group was cursing the opposite way.</p>
<p>But last month, it suddenly rained. Although it wasn't heavy, not like last year when there was half an inch of water, it did sprinkle for three to five days in a row. The farming families breathed a little easier, and there was a hint of a smile on their faces, because the grain price turned back a little. This made Master Chen Seven almost unable to eat or sleep, as if he had malaria, his face changing colors five times a day.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rain stopped. A few days of light rain couldn't do anything to the hardened fields after a long drought. The countryside was still filled with the sound of countless waterwheels under the poisonous sun.</p>
<p>Only then did Master Chen Seven let his suspended heart down.</p>
<p>Then, until now, for almost two months, there had been no rain again. The sky: boundless, blue, as if frozen. The rice seedlings were all lying down, waiting for the stronger sun to wither and die. The weeds had also curled up. So the grain price flew higher and higher day by day, from ten yuan per stone to fifteen yuan, and it hadn't stopped, it was still rising.</p>
<p>Master Chen Seven naturally stroked his mustache again, sitting in his shady villa and smiling.</p>
<p>However, the villagers all held a fearful, waiting-to-die mentality. Although the children played as usual, they couldn't hide the sallow color on their faces!</p>
<p>— "Damn it, we're really being forced to become bandits!"</p>
<p>The young men all had distorted thoughts, saying nonsense.</p>
<p>Human effort seemed unable to change the will of heaven. So the wood-headed Rain God Grandfather Bodhisattva was put to work. The quiet temple, which no one had visited for a long time, had been crowded with countless men and women from morning to night for a month. The villagers were willing to save some of their daily food to buy a few strings of paper ingots and incense candles, and then, with a devout heart, kowtowed repeatedly in front of the Rain God Bodhisattva's hall. Then, everyone pooled money to build an altar, hired a few yellow-robed Taoist priests, and banned killing for three days. The Bodhisattva was carried out on the first day.</p>
<p>From early morning on this day, gongs and whistles filled the village with excitement. The Bodhisattva walked through the whole village, from the main streets to the small alleys.</p>
<p>— "Asking Rain God Grandfather to show his power, bestow blessings, and save the lives of the little people."</p>
<p>Everyone caught a glimpse of the Bodhisattva's dead face, which was also sweating from the sun, squeaking.</p>
<p>Passing by Master Chen Seven's villa, he also ran out to watch, muttering to himself with a contemptuous tone!</p>
<p>— "Village idiots, all fools. This is the will of heaven, what's the use of a Bodhisattva?"</p>
<p>In fact, Master Chen Seven was by no means a non-theist. He said that only because he was afraid that if the Bodhisattva was carried out, rain would really fall, and then he would be finished.</p>
<p>It really was the will of heaven. A week or so passed.</p>
<p>The sky: still a boundless blue, the sun higher, the air drier, rain as precious as gold, and the Rain Bodhisattva had no way.</p>
<p>At the same time, the plague was fanning its bloody wings. People in the village fell ill every day. The ones who were caught could only lie on the bed, tossing and turning, moaning, letting them live or die, letting fate decide. And every day, you could see a line of people following someone in a thin wooden coffin, crying, from the main road in front of the village to the mountain village in the countryside.</p>
<p>Small animals were all busy moving.</p>
<p>Master Chen Seven also wanted to move at this time, to go to the city.</p>
<p>And what he hoped for every day! He wanted the millet to rise to thirty yuan per stone, so if a cloud floated in the sky, or thunder was rumbling, he would become uneasy. He worried that a heavy rain would immediately ruin his entire hope.</p>
<p>This afternoon, he really felt a little scared. The mountain-like dark clouds piled up in the middle of the sky without dispersing, and fierce thunder struck constantly, as if it would shatter the sky in an instant—the rain pouring down...making him feel as if a sharp knife had been inserted into his chest.</p>
<h3>Arrest</h3>
<p>— By Chen Shaobai</p>
<h3>Memory of the Pine Forest</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Although my hometown is a mountainous area, the village where my family lives is in a plain surrounded by mountains on all sides. When the sky is clear and the sun is bright, standing in front of the door and looking around, the distant dark green mountain peaks and shadows, gentle and silent, stretch and surround the area, just like the outline of a village. The fantastic halo抹 (mǒ; smears) of light smeared on the edges of the mountain peaks at dawn and dusk often melted my young heart in the hallucination. Naturally, a very deep impression of love for the mountains was carved on my heart. Sometimes, some relatives who came out of the mountains, or passers-by, always told many fresh and interesting things: wild boars, foxes, the eyes of tigers in the pine forest at night...many accidents that we would be frightened by when we heard them, they said extremely naturally as if nothing had happened. Therefore, it deepened my mysterious imagination of the mountains. I felt that although there were terrible wild animals in the mountains, they were still an interesting and fun place.</p>
<p>Although these are said to be childhood states of mind, they are still very strong when awakened now. It is all because everything about the mountains has always been too far away. Therefore, although there are countless people and events, and the lead of life sinks in my heart, making my childhood innocence gradually suppressed, I still feel that the mountains are very mysterious and lovely.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can never forget the small mountain behind my grandmother's house, and the pine forest on the mountain. That small mountain can really only be said to be a small mound, but in my young heart, which had not yet stepped on deep mountains and big ridges, once I climbed there, walked under the pine forest, and jumped with the wind, how interesting and happy it was!</p>
<p>At that time, my maternal grandfather was still alive, very much崇 (chóng; revered) "Ancestor", and there would always be three or five "Worship Ancestor" ceremonies held in a month. Therefore, my mother also spent a lot of time at my maternal grandfather's house. My cousin was only a little younger than me. Because my maternal grandmother loved him too much, he was not allowed to easily take a step out of the house. The small mountain behind the house was simply forbidden territory. My sister and I were more well-behaved than other village children, but we were much more naughty than my cousin. When we came, many naughty things that my maternal grandmother did not allow would also have a share of my cousin's闹 (nào; making disturbance). The most blamed thing was when we were found by my maternal aunties on the small mountain and taken back. My maternal grandmother would inevitably nag with complaints to heaven.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing to play on the mountain was digging for "sand spiders" under the roots of pine trees - this is a kind of small animal hidden in the loose soil, and because its shape is like a spider, we gave it the name of sand spider - the second thing was to pick pine cones in a competition. Catching sand spiders required experience and method, and it was also the most interesting. First, you had to judge its nest on the smooth and clean loose soil, and then insert a piece of stone into the soil with a little force and quickly turn it over. If the insertion was shallow and the action was slow, it would escape. After catching about three or four, we could sit in a circle on the ground and release these small warriors to fight each other in turn. The hearts of children sometimes tend to be cruelly naive. When their own warriors were defeated, they often used various cruel tortures to end the lives of the defeated.</p>
<p>The pine cone picking competition often took place when we had just climbed up the mountain from the foot. At that time, we were all full of enthusiasm. As long as someone shouted, this interesting competition would be completed. The result of running and jumping around was that our faces were red, and we were sweating all over. On the night after worshiping the ancestor, when lying on the door坪(píng; level open space) "打露 (dǎ lù; sleeping outdoors)" , under the pine fragrance氤氲 (yīnyūn; rich and enveloping), our interest was not in the funny引逗(yǐndòu; teasing, tempting) of the Taoist priests entering定 (dìng; meditative state) to "悟道 (wù dào; enlightenment)", but in whispering about the得意 (déyì; triumph, pride)闹 (nào; play, disturbance) in the pine forest during the day.</p>
<p>After my maternal grandfather died, I soon drifted to distant Rangoon with my grandmother. In that period of life in a foreign country, I gradually stepped out of the childhood paradise, and some awakenings of adults greatly changed my words, actions and thoughts. Later, I traveled south and north, and there were very few periods at home. When I returned home during summer vacation two years ago, my maternal grandmother passed away due to being stimulated by the decline of the family. After sending my maternal grandmother's coffin into the earth that day, the room was crowded and the weather was hot, so I climbed up the small mountain pine forest with several cousins to散(sàn; relieve, relax) for a while. At that time, it was midday, the red sun was hot in the sky, and the wind came, and the pine waves moved slightly. Thinking of the sad scene in front of me and the happy old days, although the pine forest was still the same, the人事 (rénshì; human affairs) had changed.</p>
<p>Now, my maternal grandmother has been dead for four long years; my second maternal uncle is still lying in bed all day long, swallowing clouds and spitting fog; although I heard that my cousin had quit his opium addiction last time, I don't dare to believe it; after a illness, my eldest maternal aunt has become indifferent to everything, and my second maternal aunt is struggling to support a family that is 七零八落 (qīlíngbāluò; scattered, disorganized). This tragic defeat is heartbreaking to think about. As for myself, in the past two years of wandering life, I have also carried many hardships of life. Although the old things of the pine forest in childhood are touching when I remember them, they inevitably have a bit of bitterness.</p>

<h3>Hu Die stars in "Night Blooming Cereus"</h3>
<p>"Night Blooming Cereus" is a sound film written and directed by Cheng Bugao, entirely in dialogue and song. It is a brand new tragicomedy. Its content is satirical, yet sympathetic, depicting the history of the fall of a flower girl. Whenever the lights are on, the flower girl, Hu Die, carries a flower basket and shouts to sell "Night Blooming Cereus" at the entrances of the gorgeous dance halls, bars, and cafes. She makes a living in this overpopulated metropolis, but ultimately cannot escape the influence of the evil environment of this metropolis. She is fascinated by vanity and is lured into an inextricable situation. Although she tried her best to struggle, it was all in vain. "Night Blooming Cereus" undoubtedly exposes the misfortune of women in this treacherous society and touches on the corners of the collapsing prosperous city, the economic bankruptcy of the countryside, frequent foreign aggression, and panic in life. Hu Die has now returned from her European tour. It is expected that "Night Blooming Cereus" will be completed soon, and the time to meet with people in society is not far away.</p>
<h3>China Film Company in Preparation</h3>
<p>The China Film Company, which is actively preparing, is hosted by the famous director Bu Wancang. The first work is an all-sound dialogue film, "Water Country Spring and Autumn," written by water conservancy expert Xu Xinwu. This play is based on the water conservancy project of guiding the Huai River, taking the struggle between humans and nature as its material. As a result, it uses scientific methods to overcome nature, interspersed with a moving story. The director is Bu Wancang, the photographer is Shi Shipan, and the leading actors are all first-class stars with a reputation at the moment. Now that the Yellow River has burst its banks, and disasters have spread everywhere, Bu Wancang has obtained the consent of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau and led more than 30 staff members to Kaifeng, Henan today (22nd) to shoot on location, expecting to return to Shanghai in half a month. However, due to the vastness of its background, the breadth of its work, and the current summer heat, the mental and financial costs are undoubtedly overwhelming, but the harvest of excellent results is also expected.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for New Car Drivers</h3>
<p>— Fang Yilu</p>
<p>If you are a car owner. Then assume that you are buying a new car from a car dealer now. You have to ask the people in the car dealer clearly. How to manage each part. How to use it. You have to ask them to explain in detail.</p>
<p>You have just learned to drive a car not long ago. Of course, there is no experience to speak of. Moreover. The structure and movement of the various parts of the car are even more vague. And there is no correct understanding yet. Then, after you have tested the new car you bought once, I think you should go to the expert who bought your new car and ask thoroughly. Ask for an accurate explanation of all your doubts. This kind of practical investigation is much better than just reading a few pages of instructions. Because after you have seen all the real parts, and then read the instructions. Not only is it easy to understand what is said in the instructions, but it is also twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>If the environment permits, it is best to start learning on roads with sparse traffic and flat surfaces. Afterwards. Slowly become familiar with the management of each part. Then drive on inclined roads. And you have to practice starting and stopping without panicking. In addition. You also have to be good at reversing the car.</p>
<p>Most new-style cars currently have what is called a synchromesh device installed on the gearbox. The function of this device is, on the one hand, to prevent the gears from making noise at any speed during shifting. On the other hand. It is to make shifting easier. Because in the past, gearboxes without synchromesh devices could not be dealt with casually when shifting. Especially for general novice drivers, it is even more difficult. Now. With this synchromesh device, the difficulty of shifting is completely eliminated.</p>
<p>That being said. To make the car run smoothly and the passengers comfortable, you must pay special attention to the following points. So that you can be proficient in this important action of changing speed (i.e. shifting gears).</p>
<p>(1) Moving the gear lever must be leisurely and unhurried, and everything must not be too fast. When engaging the gear lever to mesh the gears. Must slowly push down. Especially when the car is traveling at high speed. The purpose of this action of slowly pushing down the gear lever is to allow the synchromesh device sufficient time to bring each gear close to a suitable speed.</p>
<p>(2) Before engaging the clutch (i.e. releasing the clutch pedal). Often use the accelerator pedal (i.e. throttle) to adjust the engine speed to a suitable speed.</p>
<p>When shifting from a lower gear to a higher gear. For example, when shifting from first gear to second gear. Or when shifting from second gear to third gear. The accelerator pedal must be released. Let the engine speed drop. When shifting from a higher gear to a lower gear. For example, when shifting from third gear to second gear. Or when shifting from second gear to first gear. The accelerator pedal must be depressed a little. Increase the engine speed a little. Special attention must be paid to these two points. Otherwise, the entire gearbox will be greatly damaged. The higher the speed of the car when shifting gears. The longer the time to shift gears before engaging the clutch. This will allow the engine speed to match the speed inside the gearbox. And the car will drive smoothly and comfortably.</p>
<p>What engine speed is needed for the clutch to engage very smoothly without vibration. Experience will immediately tell you how to judge this speed. When the car is traveling at a very high speed. Unless you are already a seasoned car driver. You must not shift from third gear to second gear. Nor should you shift gears in this way at the highest vehicle speed that second gear can handle.</p>
<p>(3) Under any circumstances. The clutch must be released slowly. To avoid the car being shocked. The reason why the clutch must be released slowly. It is to allow the engine and gearbox to reconcile themselves even if there is a slight difference in speed. And there is no pressure on the gearbox.</p>
<p>You have to make yourself proficient in shifting gears. This is the most important thing. After the car slows down, do not forcibly depress the accelerator pedal in a high gear to try to speed up the car. This will make the engine "work hard." You must develop a good habit. Be good at using the gear lever. When going uphill. When making small turns. And when the car slows down in other situations. To make it faster again. You must always not forget to shift from high gear to medium gear. Or from medium gear to low gear. When turning. The car must be slowed down in advance. Do not rush to the corner and then suddenly brake. This will cause extra damage to the brakes and tires.</p>
<p>I think you should not drive at the car's maximum speed. Unless you can already drive very skillfully. After your driving experience gradually increases. Then gradually increase your driving speed. This can save you from a lot of dangers caused by rashness.</p>
<p>When you are driving a car. It is best not to make the car speed up and slow down suddenly. Because at a balanced speed. Gasoline consumption is relatively economical. On the contrary. When the engine speed fluctuates high and low. Fuel consumption is extremely high.</p>
<p>If the water in the cooling system is lost too much for some reason. And the engine overheats. Do not rashly add cold water. Wait until the engine cools down before adding it.</p>
<h3>Overseas Car Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Increased Automobile Production in the United States Recently, the automobile manufacturing industry in the United States. There is also a prosperous and upward trend. Each manufacturing plant is very active in manufacturing new cars. Around the end of May. Five car factories are working hard to produce. Exporting cars. His quantity is more than what was manufactured in the twelve months of 1934. In addition, the products of two car factories. It is also on par with this production record. Before June. Of course, their output is equally impressive. The new cars manufactured by other factories. Calculated at the end of the month. It will also exceed the output of 1934. The five months since the beginning of this year. Taking the entire automobile industry in the United States as a statistic. The total number of cars manufactured by each factory is 1,988,637. This official statistic. Comparing it with the same period in 1934. Its increase is about nearly 35%. As for the output in June. If several large manufacturing plants. Still working so hard. Then the half-year production this year. It will exceed the number of 2,000,000 vehicles. With this foundation for the whole year of 1935. Exceeding 4,000,000 vehicles. It seems more than enough. In addition to the Ford, Chevrolet, and Plymouth groups of lowest-priced cars. It is said that this time the increase in automobiles is for mid-priced cars.</p>
<p>Citroen Passed Away in France Mr. Citroen, known as the "Henry Ford of France," passed away in Paris, France on the 3rd of this month. Mr. Xue's body has always been very strong. So his sudden death. Exceeded the expectations of the general public. Recently, after an examination by a doctor. A surgery was performed. However, his physical strength was insufficient. Eventually passed away. Citroen cars are well made. Mass production. It is not only famous in France. It is also one of the best in Europe. Therefore, Mr. Xue actually holds the reins in the French automobile industry. He often traveled to the United States during his lifetime. He admired the American production methods very much. After returning to China. Then go to apply. The results are very good. Citroen is 57 years old this year. Born on February 5, 1878. He studied hard at the famous technical college in Paris in his early years. After graduating, he engaged in the production of small workshops. The initial scale was extremely small. There were only eleven employees. One person concurrently served as factory director, foreman, supervisor, and salesman. The first year's turnover after opening was only 15,000 francs. By the fourth year, it increased to 100,000 francs. When he died. The daily turnover of the Citroen factory would reach more than 4,000,000 francs. During the war. He served France. Very meritorious service.</p>
<p>The US Car Accident is Shocking. Incidents of car accidents in the United States. More and more every day. The number of lives lost under the wheels every year is countless. Although the authorities have tried every means to prevent it. But the effect is not very obvious. So the general public said. In other years. Everyone cherishes their own lives. However, there are many careless people on the highways and streets. In 1913. In the United States, a total of 4,227 people lost their lives due to car accidents. By 1934. It jumped to 36,000 people. And at the same time. The number of deaths caused by other accidental accidents has decreased. In 1913, the total was 78,233 people. Last year it decreased to 65,000 people. The number of cars on the market in 1934 was certainly much more than in 1931. But at the same time, the population is also increasing. Calculated to increase by 31%. What is incomprehensible. That is, as the number of cars increases. Car accident incidents also increase accordingly. And on the other hand. Although the population increases every year. The mortality rate of accidental events. Like due to family, factory, and other social activities, etc., it has decreased accordingly.</p>
