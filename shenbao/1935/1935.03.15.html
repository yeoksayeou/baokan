<p>關於節制洋米進口。及三號西貢米應否加稅之兩問題。自經行政院召集會議一度討論之後。雖未得有結果。已頗引起一般人之注意。茲先就第一點節制洋米論之。持論者對於此點。從農民方面計。則恐洋米源源而來。抑本米之價。有傷農之懼。從民食方面計。又恐一朝限制進口。米商從中操縱。米價暴漲之日。將有食艱之虞。因此而彷徨莫决。至三號西貢米應否加稅一節。大都又主張米價宜賤。加稅則米貴。有妨民食。不主增加。而又不察洋米所以進口徵稅。及其要否加稅之兩點。乃但責米商以牟利。徒為米商所竊笑而已。</p>
<p>本來糧價貴賤之一問題。處於利害衝突自相矛盾之地位。穀賤傷農。穀貴傷民。三千年來。同此感想。卽常平之制。言之成理。行之亦未必能盡如人意。治法治人。兩者固不易得兼。故談民食問題。尤其是目前。更難得有辦法。但不應以其無辦法。而遂不思辦法。卽如上海目前定有大宗洋米。究應作何處置。中央旣在考慮之中。不久自必有辦法。而在此辦法未披露以前。姑一述吾人心目中之辦法。</p>
<p>吾人欲述本問題之先。須一觀本市之米價如何。邇來米價頗為平疲。然察其平疲之因。就推想所及。不外（一）大宗期洋米。大槪為三四月進口。卽須繳欵出貨。銀根緊急。不得不急於售現。以償進口米欵。此為洋米湧到及銀根緊急之故。（二）本米在往年有囤存者。以今年之銀根。勢難久儲。若做押欵以囤米。押期屆滿。又不能不賣。於是而本米亦疲。（三）則天氣漸熱。雖距霉令尙遠。但恐米以熱變。則以及早出棧為便宜。再加以（四）人心作用。入春以來。天氣和暖。春熟有望。將來米價恐不易看好。（五）則農村破產已久。米價貴固不能購。米價賤亦無力買。交易旣無往年之旺盛。積存遂日見其厚。銷路則愈見其稀。米價乃平疲不振。然從民食着想。平疲固為福。從市面及金融着想。有擱積。無去路。銀根勢必受窘。設有風吹草動。結果仍為本國商業受虧。外人則已囊括以去。故洋米卽有去路。而從經濟上觀察多購洋米。多付金錢至外洋。已無異飲酖止渴。若去路不振。則此六百餘萬擔尙成問題。設不加限制。一任商人自由行動。不但在此種局面下。萬不可再多購洋貨。以加深金融上之危機。且必為我未來之農產稍稍着想。無加重其壓迫。故從上海一隅而論。暫時限制訂購洋米。尙不失為一辦法。</p>
<p>然則如何限制其訂購。限制不成。將用何法以處置之。限制得成。而米價若貴。又用何術以平準之。此其問誠費躊躇。或日。是不難。社會局不為登記足已。試問社會局之登記。具有何種作用。不過欲知本市米糧進出之數。以為調節之張本而已。若不為登記。是否市上卽可禁止其行銷。海關卽不准其進口乎。是不能。則所謂停止登記。原為無辦法中之一種臨時處置。非有效之辦法也。卽不為登記。不准行銷。亦必徒增糾紛。無補事實。何况上海為華洋商人雜處之地。情形又當別論。故登記與否。旣不能限制其續購。惟有勸吿商人不再訂購之一法。但此又何能生效。米價如平疲不振。不待勸吿而自不購。米價如上。升雖有餒罰。終不敵其牟利之念。而必出於一試。又况洋商志在做生意。中國如需要。固不妨抬價出銷。如無需要。亦情願貶價求售乎。故中國之米價落洋米之價亦落。米商見洋米之價合銷。又必訂購洋米。彼米商豈能深維未來之利害如何。但知目前之利固如是其厚也。</p>
<p>勸吿之術已窮。最有效之辦法。自莫如時人所主張之不登記則禁止進口之一途而已。但禁止洋米進口。應出以全國一律。是則又扞格難行。廣東向恃洋米接濟。湘米方禁止出境。皖米又不能應用。如禁止洋米進口。勢將陷廣東於民食恐慌之地步。自有以知其不然。若限於上海一口岸。不但無此理。且亦何能絕洋米之不混迹而入。禁令不一又何能阻其不裝儎而來。此就內政而。言已窒礙如是。對外則能否不招致責言。而引起糾紛。又未敢必。故禁止洋米進口。在關權尙未完整之今日。亦有其困難處。蓋若外交有辦法。禁止固可。限制亦無不可。均不成為問題矣。</p>
<p>在不能自由禁止其輸入以前。比較的可行之法。則輸入許可制是也。凡採辦外國糧食。須領取護照。海關憑照放行。認為無需要時。則卽停止發照。進口自無形停頓。此制賓行之際。必須明白糧食之生產。民衆之消費。以及市塲之供求而其困難所在。仍如禁止進口之能否不另生枝節。其所異者。則為無禁止進口之名。僅與軍械等類同其處置。實現似較為易。如此辦法。粵滬不妨分別處理。粵則仍發護照。滬則停發。其已登記之洋米。一律補照。若至洋米進口之後。米糧仍行缺乏。尙須補充。貝亦不妨續發護照。以便採購。好在洋米一電旣發。不兩星期卽可到達也。一面為防範米商停止躲購後之操縱計。凡一區域內之米糧。到·銷·存·三項數目。詳加調查。領照之洋米。其到達·存棧·出銷·以及銷地之為本外埠。均須隨時報吿。以便查考。則米商如有操縱居奇之實迹。亦不難制止。至於三號西貢米應否加稅之一問題。以非篇幅所許。當另文論之。</p>
<h3>美參議員反對　參加國際借欵　徒喪失對債務國友誼　主張以物代現欵助華</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）民主黨參議員路易斯今日在參院演說、竭力反對美國參加國際對華借欵、謂美國如與他國合作、給與中國以財政上之協助、則美國將被迫處於不利之地位、「且吾人對於貸欵外國、已有可痛之經騐、不獨金錢損失、卽與債務國之邦交亦併而失之、故如欲避免損失金錢、及有關對華借欵各國之邦交、不如另以他法協助中國之為愈、吾人儘可建議、如中國須要債欵、不妨預先通知吾人、其所欲購者究為何物、所需之物如為吾人所能供給者、則儘可以信用方法盡量供給」云、按國際對華借欵、國會議員向報界雖已頗多評語、然正式在議塲提出者、猶以路氏為第一次云、（十三日國民社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）德國政府通知英法意三國、聲明德國從本年四月一日起將正式組織空軍、此事在法律上及外交上均已引起多種問題、現正由主管人員加以研究、查德國此種舉動、除公然違反凡爾賽條約第五部分外、並與二月三日英法倫敦宣言書相抵觸、德國前已接受以倫敦宣言書作為談判之基礎、今談判尙未開始、而德國竟藉倫敦宣言書中准許德國參加天空公約為口實、實行建立空軍、然倫對宣言書固明白規定、必俟英法全部提議獲有結果時、方可簽訂天空公約、今德國遽而出此一舉、則其遠反倫敦宣言書之精神、已無疑義現聞英法兩國政府已表示一致、將向德國聲明、凡經和約限制軍備之各國、均無權以單方面行動、變更其義務德國自亦不能視為例外、要而言之、此種聲明不過重申一月七日法意協定所宣且佈之主張而已、且除上項法律問題外、德國此舉、並引起未來談判中之政治問題、對於此種政治問題相關各國政府自必依照羅馬恊定及倫敦協定之精神而共同行動云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西門定期訪德　二十四日偕艾登同行</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相西門定期三月二十四日偕掌璽大臣艾登同乘飛機前赴柏林、而於二十五六兩日與德元首希特勒會商一切、聞所將討論之問題之一、為認德國重置空軍為合法、惟德國須與英法意比締結一種天空洛迦諾公約、與波蘭蘇俄締結東歐安全公約、及與各國締結軍備限馳公約、西門原擬孒身而往、但今日閣議决定以艾登偕行、蓋艾登除任掌璽大臣外、且為英國軍縮專家、而二人同行、亦更覺莊重也、按西門原定三月七日赴柏林、乃至三月五日、卽英國發表國防白皮書之次日、接德政府來文、謂因元首患寒疾、嗓音失常、請西門展緩至德云、衆信德國因不懌於白皮書中述及德國重整軍備事、故有此舉、至西門赴莫斯科之日期、現仍在與俄當局討論中、尙未决定也、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）今日官報載稱、德外長牛賴特曾於上星期六通知英大使、謂英外相西門之訪柏林、前以希特勒元首政躬不豫而展期、現可於兩星期內成行、英大使當建議以三月二十五日或二十六日為行期、德政府現已通知英大使、歡迎英國責賓於該日蒞止云、另據倫敦電訊、西門外相將偕掌璽大臣艾登同行、準備在柏林勾留三日、惟艾登是否將自柏林逕往莫斯科、則尙未定、蓋英俄談判辦法仍在進行中也、（十三日國民社）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）哈瓦斯通訊社駐莫斯科記者訪問蘇聯外委長李維諾夫、謂或稱蘇聯政府邀請艾登來蘇、此說信乎、如可信、艾氏將何時抵此、李維諾夫答稱、當蘇聯政府正式獲悉英國政府擬派艾登來蘇之消息後、卽令駐英大使、知照英國外交部、謂艾君能抵莫斯科、極表歡迎、同時邀請艾君至蘇聯首都、至艾氏何日啟程、則猶未定云、（十三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國閣員現已决定於三月二十四日赴柏林、英國負責人士聲明、英國閣員赴德、其所負使命乃在支持二月三日英法聯合宣言書之全部云、按近來外間常有多少含有惡意之解釋、謂英國閣員赴德之結果、將使英法提議中各要點各相分離、今負責人士有此聲明、則此種解釋不攻自破矣、現有種種理由可以相信、外相西門及掌璽大臣艾登將奉命向希特勒總理詳細陳述、謂英國政府主張東歐安全問題與德國西境安全問題兩者不應分離、換言之、凡主張拋撇法國而謀東歐安全組織之各種建議、英國政府均視為不合時勢需要、因此東歐方面立陶宛·愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞諸國、堅主各種防止侵略之工具必使其互相關連、倫敦方面聞之、頗為欣喜、不寗唯是、英國外交界　時以為東歐安全組織可以互不干涉內政之原則為基礎、今則已不再堅持此種主張、以為唯有規定相互援助、方足使有關國家獲得完全之安全感也、假定如一般人之所望、德國贊成以上之原則、承認東隊公約與西歐安全問題不可分離、則英國代表當繼續與德國討論、以安全方面所獲滿意之程度為比例、酌量承認德國重整軍備、惟無論如何、承認德國重整軍備、有一最大限度、卽不能承認德國有與蘇聯相等之軍力、蓋蘇聯軍力須應付遠東事變、蘇聯遠東邊境之危險亦殊不遜於其歐洲邊境也、此外消息靈通人士以為德國政府最近發表命令、使其民用航空人員改隸軍籍、此舉顯然觸犯凡爾賽條約第五部分、當英國閣員赴德之前、德此舉、僅係對於英國發表國防政策白皮書之一種答復、故不足計較、然苟經三思、則英德談話其目的本在訂結新約、以樹立安全制度、今此種談判甫將開始、而德國竟單方面廢棄舊日所訂之條約、則其事誠屬不可思議矣、對於德國設置空軍之舉、英國是否將就外交途徑提出抗議、抑俟西門赴德時當面交涉、現尙未悉、惟英國對於此事斷不至付諸緘默、則有必然者也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>于學忠　昨接見新聞界</h3>
<p>談戰區問題及冀省財政等　參觀滬建設明夜入京北返</p>
<p>中央社云、河北省政府主席于學忠氏、前日由杭到滬、昨日上午、在滄洲飯店、接見各報社記者、午後、前往市政府拜訪吳市長、並參觀大上海之建設、定於今日乘坐夜車入京、轉道北返、道經濟南時、决下車小駐、會晤魯省主席韓復榘氏、茲將于氏談話、分紀如下、</p>
<p>戰區問題</p>
<p>據于氏談、華北戰區內各項問題、現已漸次解决、馬蘭峪日偽軍隊徹退問題、一俟高橋武官由長春返平、卽可商决、新舊保安隊調防問題、除人數略有爭執外、其餘均已商妥、至於保安隊整理問題、刻已開始進行、蓋當李際春部收撫改編之時、原定趙雷部人數為二千、劉作周部人數亦為二千、石友三部收撫改編之人數為一千、目前劉作周部實際上之人數較之原定數、超過三百餘人、石友三部實際上之人數、亦超過原定數八百餘人、以致給養無着、時有騷擾情事、現在業將馮壽彭部調駐唐山、孫繼周部調駐通州附近、劉作周部調駐灤州、以便戰區淸理委員會派員嚴加整理、</p>
<p>黃河決口</p>
<p>目前黃河决口、形勢頗為危急、决口之最大者為貫台、而影響所及首當其衝者為冀省、次為魯省、再次為豫省、冀省之長垣、刻已全遭淹歿、濮陽亦遭波及、蓋因黃河之堤岸與缺口、多待冬季河凍之時堵修、去冬天氣和暖、河水未凍、堵修困難、加之春水暴漲、致肇此禍、目前貫台决口、深達二十六公尺、闊度亦為二十六公尺、堵塞極為困難、刻正由水利委員會會同冀魯豫三省河務局、會商善後、</p>
<p>冀省財政</p>
<p>冀省自九一八事件發生後、灤東成為戰區、稅收銳减、加之戰時地方之支出倍增、以致虧空達六百餘萬之多、迨至現今、則僅負債一百餘萬、預計二十四年度、當能償淸舊欠、收支相抵、至於建設方面、因限於經濟、殊鮮進步、將來之建設方針、則决從水利及道路兩端做起、去年建設之靈壽渠、其費四十餘萬、今春當可完工、</p>
<p>省市劃界</p>
<p>北平市與河北省劃界問題、目前仍未解决、平市面積原為二千餘方里、面積之大、為全國各市之冠、現擬重行劃界、面積擴大至一萬六千餘方里、前曾在京一度召開劃界會議、並無結果、迄今仍未解决、</p>
<p>黃未全愈</p>
<p>黃委員長膺白政躬漸趨康健、惟尙未全愈、本人此次過杭、曾參觀省政、至於來滬亦係參觀滬市市政、以資借鏡、本人擬於明日離滬北返、過濟時將下車小駐、參觀魯省最近之情形云、</p>

<h3>余籍傳談　湘省公債用途</h3>
<p>三分之二建築公路餘還舊欠　財政廳長張開璉明日可抵滬</p>
<p>國聞社云、湖南省政府建設廳廳長余籍傳、自十二日晨抵滬後、連日與銀行界洽商該省建設公債抵押現欵事宜、頗為圓滿、國聞社記者、昨晤余氏於其私邸、詢以公債用途、及接洽經過、承語頗詳、</p>

<p>簽訂合同</p>
<p>此事本人（余氏自稱）已與銀行界數度商洽、大致可無問題、惟利率年限担保等、尙未確定、擬俟敝省財政廳長張開璉氏來滬、再作决定、現張廳長已於昨日由漢口乘輪東下、至南京登陸、乘快車來滬、約於明晚可以到達、該項公債抵押現欵、如可成立、本人將與張廳長、會同簽字云云、</p>

<h3>申新七廠事件　購方繳欵之謎</h3>
<p>關鍵全在償債問題　榮宗敬談事已過去</p>
<p>華東社云申新七廠糾紛近傳購方已付欵說、華東社記者昨晨復赴關係各方調查、據說上述傳說乃不確、蓋此事買賣兩方、均係出某一個機關也、至於解决此事之關鍵、全在付欵問題、蓋自此事發生後、經我國上下一致交涉、匯豐方面已允贖回、惟彼方堅持、須將本利全部淸償、而我方經孔財長·陳實長·吳市長·等數度集商之下、因在環境下、全部淸償、殊為事實所限、乃數次與匯豐銀行當局洽商、先償一部份利息二十五萬元、其餘則分四期歸還、匯豐則始終堅持、不允分期拔還、直至限期、買方乃佯言欵已繳淸云云、現則我政府若允匯豐之條件則贖回固不成問題也云云、此外尙據關係方面向華東社記者證明此事、未有第三者涉及漩渦、因自申新事發後、各國人士均頗為震驚、尤在此世界經濟衰落之候、此二百二十五萬元之欵、雖屬區區、但一般人目光中、申新七廠之前途營業、均不能似榮宗敬氏經營之能輕而易舉也、故現時解决之焦點、乃在分期與一齊歸還之兩問題耳、至於申新方面、截至現今、仍未接得任何方面通吿、廠中仍照常工作、</p>
<p>國聞社云、關於申新七廠拍賣問題、外傳受主業已付欽、昨據榮宗敬氏語國聞社記者謂、申新七廠、昨仍繼續工作、拍賣問題、業已過去、望國人不必再談、只望將來全國同胞、努力服用國貨、絕對不買洋貨、一方面希望政府、實行復興農村、使全國棉產、漸漸增加、則華商紗廠、亦不必購買外棉、誠如此、則紗業前途、當可安定、至於該廠所欠匯豐之欵、將先還一部份利息、本錢仍以廠地及生財抵押云云、</p>
<h3>棉統會　推進各地植棉</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會棉業統制委員會、自成立以來、對於各地棉業之推進、不遺餘力、故各省棉業日見發展、該會預計於五年內、可以不再仰給外棉、最近浙江省政府、以以境內種棉者日增、對於棉種之選擇、至為重要、故托棉統會採辦棉種數千担、並悉其他各省、亦函托該會採辦優良棉種甚衆、預料本年棉花收穫、必較去年大增、該會為調查全國棉業狀况起見、原擬每年派員分赴各地調查、茲為節省開支時間起見、决採用通訊式調查云、</p>

<h3>道勝銀行清理處已遞訴狀　請求扣押東　惟該碼頭情形甚為複雜　法院是否准許尙未批復</h3>
<p>新聲社云、中東路非法買買實現後、除我政府方面、已提出抗議、並擬向國際間發表聲明外、本埠華俄道勝銀行淸理處、以與該路有權益之關係、已正式早請地方法院執行扣押東鐵在滬財產、如浦東碼頭等、惟該碼頭曾在美領署註冊、情形頗複雜、茲分誌之於次、</p>
<p>呈請扣押</p>
<p>日前記者得悉道勝銀行淸理處請求法院扣押楊家渡東鐵浦東嗎頭之消息、曾往探詢、當時其發言人猶稱尙在考慮中、但昨日已不復否認、足證確已呈請地方法院執行扣押、並委托華律師姚永勵·楊瑞年·及美律師許理·台威斯。勞敦·等代辦一切、其　請扣押之理由、係因於一九二零年十月至一九二四年底、先後曾代為墊欵購買鐵路材料等達五八九·六三七·五二元屢索未還、今且將該路非法轉賣、為維持權益計、故呈請執行扣押、但據該行發言人稱、呈文送出後、法院是否准許、現尙未接批示、不過該行之法律顧問雅瓦登斯基、則信此行在法律方面之立脚點、理由頗充實、</p>
<p>關係複雜</p>
<p>惟該碼頭關係頗為複雜、據記者調查、該碼頭計佔地十二畝一分八厘三毫、寬可二十英尺、靠江一面、可四百五十英尺、有三百英尺長之浮筒、並有一小棧房與辦公處、全部產業、價値二十一萬元、外報載値八十萬元說、道勝銀行謂無此高大價格、已於數年前在美國領事署註冊、其註册號數為八三六號、故實際上已成為中美日俄之四角關係、日方旣宣稱中東路為偽國所購、故該碼頭果被扣留時、日本實無發言之餘地、且中國向俄抗議、並向世界各國、聲明不承認日俄間之非法買賣、故在法理上、中國有權阻止蘇俄將該碼頭移交、然現又涉及美國、則其問題更為複雜矣、</p>

<h3>西商亦多　反對電話加價</h3>
<p>華東社云、上海租界電話公司加價計劃、以該公司於過去曾略有虧蝕、而至去年、該公司之盈餘、未能到達拆息一分之水準、於是遂有加價之主張、此項主張、經該公司呈請工部局後、董事會已在考慮中、按照該公司與工部局之協定、電話加價不得超過百分之二十五、故現在該公司之增加率、為百分之二十二有奇、私人電話、自每月七元五角八分增至八元半、營業電話、則自十二元四角而降至十元、惟每月祗限打一百次、逾次則按次取費三分計算、昨日工部局董事會方面非正式向華東社記者表示、此事現在正由工部局董事會討論、各外董縝密研究之下、認為其理由頗為充分、（？）故而對原則上將有同意之趨勢、果爾則電話加價、將於四月一日有實現可能矣、</p>
<p>加價盈餘　華東社記者探悉、電話公司佔計、於實行加價之後、其每月所打電話次數、可减至百分之五十、在電話次數减少之後、每年之盈餘額、計為一百五十二萬三千七百五十元、但據本市外籍商業界推測、電話加價之後、其打電話之次數、决不能减少、因現在吾人之欲打電話、均為必須打而打者、極少故意多打者、如按電話公司减少至百分之五十、而能盈餘如是之鉅、則實際之每年盈餘額、當倍於電話公司預估之數、卽為三百零四萬七千五百元、同時因此之故、而有一般人欲借打電話者、不能借打、勢必打公用電話、於是公用電話之增加次數、亦較前為甚、於是電話公司、又可多得一筆收入云、</p>
<p>西人反對　電話公司之加價、本市方面、頗多反對、因損及營業、於能力上亦不堪負担也、西人方面、亦有反對、昨日上海西籍經紀人公會（Shangbai　Eacuange　Brokers　Association昨特致函工部局董事會、要求减價、該會復致函華人方面之各團體、以期博得同情、聞該會會員之所用電話者、共計九百綫、如一旦加價、則所受損失、至為重大云、</p>

<h3>蛋業外銷慘落　美增稅提議尚未實行　蛋價慘跌年損一千萬　望政府免稅俾可競爭</h3>
<p>國聞社云、我國蛋業、內受農村破產影響、外因各國關稅壁壘、致外銷情形、每況愈下、雖則在數量方面、反見增加、然價值方面、已跌至無可再跌、上海蛋商為數頗多、大半均屬小本經營、其入同業公會之大蛋商、不過三十家而已、中國鮮蛋、例由上海·天津·青島·漢口·四處出口、每年出口、為數甚鉅、價值約在數千萬元、為我農村副業之一種、最近美國曾有人向國會提議、對中國蛋類、實行增稅、同時我施公使亦提抗議、記者昨日紛向本埠蛋商、探詢所得、詳誌如次、</p>
<p>蛋品來源　鮮蛋來源、大都產於江·浙·皖·贛·鄂·豫·魯·等省、由小販至內地收集、運至滬·漢·津·青·等埠出口、查去年出口總數、在一百六十萬担、直接銷於國內者、約四千萬担、去年夏季、受天時亢旱之災、農作物既受影響、對於鷄鴨食料、當然發生問題、故去年以來、即從前沿長江各著名產蛋之區、來源亦大減、加以外銷限制、蛋價大跌、總計過去一年、因跌價而受之損失、在一千萬元以上、</p>
<p>蛋價狂跌　往年內地鮮蛋、其價目各季不同、春季每担自二十元至十七八元、夏季自十五六元至十七八元、秋冬時季、因消耗稍大、價在二十元至二十七八元、唯近年來春季祇十四五元、夏季十一二元、而較小之蛋、每担祇八九元、秋冬雖屬旺市、其價亦僅十五六元、以至二十一二元、此中原因、一由同業傾軋、二因國外市場、感受限制、</p>
<p>外銷慘落　我國蛋類出口、數量最鉅之區、首推天津·次上海·次青島·又次為漢口·蛋類大概分鮮蛋（鷄鴨）水蛋、（包括全蛋蛋黃蛋白）乾蛋·濕蛋·彩蛋·鹹蛋·凍蛋·等、外銷各國、新加坡·美·意·法·德·日·比·丹·荷·澳·菲律濱·新加坡·等處、每年營業、頗為可觀、查民國十九年、出口總值、在七千九百七十餘萬、至去年祇三千零二十餘萬元、相差在一倍以上、茲將最近兩年中、我國蛋類出口數量與總值、列表如下、</p>
<p>年份　水濕乾蛋品　鮮彩鹹蛋　總值</p>
<p>廿二年　四七三一五噸　三五四六六二個　三六〇七九六二四元</p>
<p>廿三年　四九四七四噸　三一九五四五個　三〇二四三五二六元</p>
<p>美增蛋稅　前經報載、謂美國對中國蛋類輸入、擬增關稅、記者向蛋商叩詢、謂祇見報載、美議員曾向國會提出、同時我駐美公使、亦提抗議、究竟實行與否、尚不得知、至於中國輸美蛋量、依據去年海關統計、自一月至十一月間、乾蛋白黃以及水濕蛋黃、共一四·零五二公担、鮮蛋彩蛋鹹蛋、因無確實統計、尚不在內、為數當然可觀、茍美實行增稅、則我又多一層損失、故在今茲蛋業衰落之時、所希望於政府者、能即豁免出口蛋稅、希望於同業者、在誠意合作、否則將無力競爭於國際市場、難免步我國絲茶之後塵也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （徐豪吾）</p>
<p>身體的健康在血；社會的紛亂在錢。</p>
<p>血必運行；　稱通寳。局部的淤積，都要引起局部或全組織的障礙，不是好現象。</p>
<p>花花綠綠的鈔票，一樣血腥氣。所不同的，富人沉緬酒色，「取之不盡，用之不竭的，泰半別人血肉，沒有像窮人哀號呻吟，拿自已汗血換來的那麽辛酸撲鼻罷了。</p>
<p>惟其錢是血凝結而成的，所以白相人嘴裏以血代錢，普通人心裏以錢作血；有了錢，不是兒子也是兒子；沒有錢，生身父母視同奴婢。</p>
<p>錢是血；蒼蠅見血就啜、亳不遲疑；人難道就是蒼蠅的化身？</p>
<h3>最古的施粥廠</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>時已仲春，各地施粥廠，都已經或快將紛紛停辦了：因此便使我想到那江蘇如皋縣的施粥廠—吾國最古的施粥廠。</p>
<p>如臯的施粥廠，溯其設立歷史，已有二三百年之久，還是創始於明朝。這廠所以能成立至今，全賴著一輩善士踴躍輸將，或捐米，或助錢。本來如臯有「金」之稱。你如在街上，瞧到一位腰圍靑布裙的漢子，你切莫笑他是十老兒，他說不定有數萬家產，幷且還是極平常的事。有錢的人旣這樣多，自無怪捐個四五百元給施粥廠，原也不在話下。最難得者，是主持粥廠的人員。他們並不想從中漁利，或侵吞善欵；否則，這個無名氏捐三百元，那個隱名氏捐五百元，你要吞沒一筆，是無從查考的，因爲如皋的善士捐欵，都不肯披露眞姓名。</p>
<p>每到冬令，離城五十里以內的貧民，都把一家老小載在船內，搖到粥廠附近停泊著。他們可以坐吃三個月，粥廠裏是來者不拒的。所以北風一起，粥廠前面，小船首尾相接，長至數里，好像是排的一字長蛇陣，也可以說是奇觀。這非有雄厚的粥本那能行！</p>
<p>按施粥之舉，揆諸「仁政勿恤」之旨，雖似未合：然究竟也是仁者之用心，其意亦未可厚非。像如臯的施粥廠，能賡續至二三百年之久，亦好算難能可貴了</p>
<h3>江亢虎之三國演義談</h3>
<p>— 鄭梅</p>
<p>江。亢虎博士，寓辛家花園淸凉寺，距敝居不遠，因得常往領敎，博士知予輯「三國大全」，遂談及渠對於三國演義之感想，頗雋永有味，爰記之於左：</p>
<p>「吾嘗讀三國志而有感，以爲三國眞中國人才輩出之時也！明君賢相，猛將謀臣，各國多有之，任何一國之人才，皆足以撥亂反正，成統一而致太平；而終於不能者，則以其他二國，亦有相當相等之人才，互爲相抵相消之工作也，向使三國人才合一，則東漢早已中興，卽任何二國合縱連衡，以制第三國，戰亂亦决不至如是之劇且久，故三國各有人才，人才分屬三國，是天之未欲平治天下也！吾又嘗讀三國演義而重有感，夫三國人才誠爲鼎盛，然其姓名行事所以家喻戶曉，耳熟而能詳者，則演義通俗宣傳之功不可沒也，割據之局，前乎三國，有春秋戰國，何嘗無如三國之人才；後乎三國，有六朝五代，亦何嘗無如三國之人才；徒以無歷史小說如三國演義者，其人才遂與一般國民之心思耳目絕緣，而其姓名行事之影響於風俗社會者，亦遂至有限，歷史小說之效用大矣哉！三國演義，根據史料，博採軼聞，自出心裁，允推名搆。」</p>
<p>博士言至此，又謂君輯成大全，包羅萬象，不第爲三國志與演義之功臣，實讀三國志與演義者不可少之良友，人才何不幸而生於三國，齮齕傾軋，無以各盡其長，人才又何幸而生於三國，得名史家之記載，名小說家之描摩，使千載下猶凛凜有生氣，君此作更廣其傳，可附陳壽羅貫中而不朽，則獎借之辭，予殊不敢當也。</p>
<h3>春耕</h3>
<p>— 江敉</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　唐突女郎前露財選色覬覦墻隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>張介夫也在旁邊凑趣道；是呀！賈老爺有的是錢這點兒錢他是不在乎的，你們拿了去罷。這眞是朱胡氏出於夢想以外的事情，立刻彎着腰向他道了兩個萬福。月英也是不曾受過人家這般厚惠的人，早是把兩道緊鎖的眉毛展開了，向賈多才笑道；多謝了。窮人只有沾老爺們一點光的。賈多才想不到這錢一過手，他也有說笑了，於是跟着後面也走出房來，低聲笑道：你看着，我這個人，不是很好說話的嗎？假如你和我在一處多些時侯，你就可以知道我是最好說話的人了。月英看若他，然後低下頭去，微微的一笑。將下唇抿起來，用牙微咬着。賈多才有這個特別的嗜好，愛看女人羞答答的情形。月英旣是做出這個樣子來了，他就有些着了迷惑。當朱胡氏走了出來，隨着月英走的時侯，他也就跟了月英走。張介夫他站在這裏是個閑人，主人也走了，客、也走了，他站在這裏有什麽意思。所以他看到賈多才隨在朱胡氏母女身後走去了，他不便驚動，也就悄悄的走回房裏去。這時，賈多才屋子裏，就剩着那兩疊洋錢看守了桌子，比較的是淸靜了。可是在暗地裏，却有個人情緒是特別的緊張。原來這屋子是用木板隔合的雖是凑合得很整齊，可是去建築的日子，有了縫隙了。在那間屋子裏，住着一個婦人，他悶住着無聊，找了一本起牙牌數的書，在燈下看着。這邊說話的聲音，送到他耳朵裏去，他很是驚奇，覺得這分明是一種人肉買賣，若說到有錢可掙的話，這樣的事，誰不願做。（一五七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其實我也早知道上古時候有一位後來給人尊稱爲「嫘祖」的女人，怎樣敎導人民育蠶的故事，不過太后所說的比較特別一些。伊所說的是：</p>
<p>「上古時候，有一個女孩子，在某一天上，忽然發現了一條蠶：伊覺得很有趣，便捉來裝在一個匣子裏，後來也就忘記了。過得三四天，驀地又想到了，它忙打開匣子一看，却已失了那蠶的所在，只見有一個白色的橢圓形的東西：伊也沒有什麽心思去仔細研究，便取出來玩弄着。伊的父母見了，也覺得很詫異。那時候當然還沒有繭子這名稱，但經他們仔細拈弄了一番之後，竟發現這東西上有絲可以抽下來的，並且想到了利用絲的可能；便合着那女孩子一同出去用心覓取。只因他們往往是從桑葉上覓到的綠故，便斷定桑葉就是蠶的飼料。從此，育蠶繅絲的事業，便逐漸的改良發展；到如今我們中國境內的田野裏，差不多已有一半是種着桑樹了各處鄉間，目有專供這個女孩子的神廟；育蠶人家每年都要去祭禱，希望伊能够來保佑他們所養的蠶都能結出好的繭子來。這個女孩子於是便成爲中國歷史上的一個有名人物。」</p>
<p>我也不知道還是太后這一番話可靠呢，還是別人的傳說可靠？不過嫘祖在我們中國的歷史上，確然是一個極受人崇拜的大發明家。（二六八）</p>
<h3>鞋子</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>晚「脫鞋子的時候，忽然在鞋子的綠發現了一條隙縫。</p>
<p>「鞋子破了！這樣嘆息了一聲，同時腦海裏便發生了一些感想：</p>
<p>最初我到鞋子店裏，從許多鞋子當中選出這一雙修短合度的鞋子，它那堅韌的皮革上還顯露着透亮的光芒，穿在脚上引起許多人都向我的足部行着注目禮</p>
<p>鞋子跟我每天跑東跑西，有時候它那表面不免染上灰塵，我便用絨布擦拭，加些鞋油，再經過刷刷，於是它又煥然一新了。</p>
<p>可是時間漸漸地過去，逢到落雨的時侯，鞋子也跟我脚踏在泥濘的路上，堅韌的皮革不免給泥水浸濕，透亮的光芒不免給汚塵蒙蔽，雖然我還是繼續整理淸潔着它，但它再也不能像先前那樣地引人注視了。</p>
<p>現在這鞋子不但後跟磨成低曲，而眼前又發現它的邊緣有了隙縫，它是不堪再用了；它將要交在傭婦的手要，做那垃圾桶中的廢棄物了—</p>
<p>鞋子爲我在生活的過程中毀滅，它從來沒有說過一句怨言；可是我對於這帮助我的鞋子，—這帮助我走過許多路程的鞋子，看見它要永遠離開我的時侯，就能够沒有一點戀惜的心情嗎？</p>

<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>民國結婚禮服之變遷</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>我國五千年來，衣服之變遷，已不知幾許度矣。蓋凡一朝鼎立之後，必先後衣服裝飾之定制，尤以新婚禮服，最爲重視，有一定之制度，但一朝之新婚禮服，必俟鼎革而後，方另定制式，故數百年間，新婚禮服，不常隨尋常衣服而變易也。</p>
<p>自民國成立之後，以禮服之制未定，且屢經改革，於是新婚禮服，亦因時代而幾易式樣，絕無一定。民國二十四年以來，新婚禮服之不同，月年相異，與昔時一朝一式之制，大不相同，皆因禮服之未經决定也。總計自民國元年以後，迄至今日，新婚禮服之變革，約可分爲以下之數種，茲略記於後。</p>
<p>民國元年時，以淸室遜位未久，服制未定，民間只知淸代箭衣外套之不適用於結婚禮服，但無一定禮服格式，罔知順從，結婚禮服，遂各投習俗，大約新郎穿長袍玄褂，袍料顏色，以淺艷爲主，新婦則依然紅裙披風，與淸代無異，此爲民國定鼎未久之最先結婚禮服了。</p>
<p>其後新婦皆知披風紅裙之不合時代，然無禮服之式樣，乃效歐美裝束，衣西服，色以粉紅爲尙，頭兜珠紗。長不及地，新郎則仍長袍玄褂，瓜皮小帽，此爲民二三時之最盛裝束。過此時代，新婦復易以平常式樣之衣裙，色粉紅或大紅，頭戴珠冠，新郎則以小爲入時，窄袖小襟之袍褂，爲結婚時所盛行，如是者約二三載。</p>
<p>至民八九時，新婦服裝，始有禮服之製，乃對襟繡圑龍或團鶴化之短夾杉，長至膝邊。結婿時用紅色，餘用天津色，下繫紅裙，亦綉花枝，結婚時用粉紅或大紅，平時則爲大紅一色，頭上戴珠冠，且有珞瓔遮面，又兜以珠紗，結婚時乎捧鮮花，新郎裝束，長袍玄褂與西式禮服並行，袍褂則戴瓜皮帽，西式則戴高硬之大禮帽，凡有結婚，總不出些一種服裝矣。</p>
<p>迄至今日，旗袍已定爲女子禮服，結婚禮服，自以旗袍爲主，但亦有短袖長袖，與特製之分，惟色則以粉紅爲多，所兜珠紗，拖於地者尋丈，新郎則以藍袍玄褂瓜皮帽爲禮服，祇以年來西裝盛行，多以西裝大禮服爲結婚時之禮服，而政府所頒定之藍袍玄褂，反不常見，皆時代與習俗使然也。</p>

<h3>聯華廠創造三輪式游泳衣</h3>

<h3>從騎士小說説到唐吉訶德</h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>作爲騎士小說的題材底表現一之先行者，是中世的騎士詩篇一，騎士的抒情詩等樣式。中世紀的支配者的封建貴族，把自已的精神反映在這時代的文學上，從而騎士的詩篇，軍事偉業的武勳的詩歌，反映騎士的精神戀愛的抒情詩，遂成爲中世紀歐洲文學底一大主流。這些作品的主人公，時常不外是爲國土和宗敎底忠僕的從僕，感覺得「應當爲君主忍受苦熱，冱寒，缺乏，而不惜一己的血肉」，感覺得「飲食和甜蜜的睡眠，都不能像前進，「戰塲去』的呼聲那樣安慰他的心」，「以特殊的政治詩來推護君全的權益，威嚇或嘲笑其敵人」，以變愛詩來讚美封建主之妻，讚美她底美麗，崇高的德行，表白其忠良臣民底感情的騎士。</p>
<p>及至十三世紀，自然經濟的封建構成，漸爲新興的經濟——商業資本主義經濟——所侵蝕而日趨沒落，於是作爲封建主義繁榮期中的文學底主要內容的叙事詩（詩篇）和抒情詩（戀愛詩）的樣式，乃漸爲滲透着頗爲濃郁的都市氣氛的散文小說所代替。到了十四世紀布爾喬亞文化之確立於意太利，於是中世紀底詩歌型態和樣式，那種丰淸的，對於封建制度的擁護和讀美的詩歌，和充滿着禁慾主義，宗敎氣分，奇蹟的幻想的要素，唯心的象徵主義的，作爲漸次沒落的騎士階級貴族階級的意識形態之藝術的表現的，但丁（Dant）的詩歌，乃不得不爲薄伽丘（Boccacio）底現實主義的作品，散文小說的「十十日談（Decameron）所替代。</p>
<p>然而，隨着商業資本主義之發展而來的君主權的要求，於是騎士詩歌又復活於意大利。這時候十五世紀）意大利的新的騎士詩篇，「便由這兩種要素——一方是貴族化了的資產階級對於騎士的主題的兒味，他方是那欠缺藝術的完成，而充滿着一切童話式的荒唐滑稽和支離滅裂的民謠——之結合而發生出來的。這種詩篇，一面把騎士和他們的軍事的及戀愛像蹟加以理想化，同時却又把民間之蕪雜的騎士詩歌之拙劣的手法和離亂的主題引用進來了」。然而，在這裏我們能必得注意的乃是和道種現象同時發生的騎士詩篇底手法上的「戲擬」。住於佛羅倫斯的作家蒲爾齊（Pulci）的詩篇「莫爾剛特（Morgante）即在「戲擬」的形式上給與封建制度和由於商業資本階級之貴族化而來的騎士詩篇底復活以一種辛辣的諷刺和嘲笑，這種諷刺的態度直至佛倫果（Folengo）的詩篇「帕爾都斯」，乃發展爲一種獨特的完成的形態。而十六世紀的法國人文主義作家拉布萊（Francois　Rabelais）的小說，更以一種莊重而誇張的乎法，二種流行於平民及貴族間的騎士小說底諧謔的反寫，給與封建制的騎士制度的猛烈的諷刺。</p>
<p>作爲利用這種騎士小說底諧謔的反寫——「戲擬」的手法，而獲得最大的成功者，是十七世紀西班牙的聖萬提斯（Cervnntes）</p>
<p>到了十七世紀以後，西班牙的貴族階級，也因都市的新興階級及其文化之抬頭而崩潰下來，這一現象表現在文學上，一方面給與那漸趨死滅的騎士階級，其文化，詩歌以致命的打擊；而一方面則、「以最後的圓光來圍照那已成「過去的陰影』的騎士底姿態。「爲此，這時代西班牙的騎士小說之利用「戲擬」的手法，把騎士底姿態漫畫面，乃是一椿値不得奇怪的事。</p>
<p>於是，醜怪，衰老，偏執，骨瘦如柴的「唐吉訶德」，穿上了破舊的　甲，騎上可憐的劣馬羅西郎特，把一個肥胖的農家女德麗池勒亞當作貴婦人，帶了他的隨從Sancho　Panza，幹他底頂天立地的偉業去了。</p>
<p>我門的作者雖然用「戲擬」的手法，描繪出了騎士可憐的面影，而在其中滲透着溫情的嘲笑；然而，正和果戈理之描寫「外套」的主人翁阿加克阿加克維支一樣，他的笑並不是冷酷的，寗乃是憂鬰的，在那種嘲笑底深處，我們可以體味出一種幾乎是熱愛的滋味。在使人家笑後，他更人家帶走了一顆沈重的心，一種眞實的憂鬰。堅萬提斯「一面以嘲笑來埋葬騎士的世界和騎士的文學（自從「吉訶德先生」出現以後，西班牙便不再有騎士小說出現了。）同時也用着詩的光耀的圓光。來圍照着自己的「悲哀姿態的騎士」的頭，」這一表現於「吉訶德先生」的二重性，也正是作爲隨封建制度底沒落，及都市資本主義文化底達而解體的西班牙小資產階級一份子的，聖萬提斯底意識形態底反映：他明白地理解騎士制度底崩潰和死滅，因而明確地描繪出這「過去的陰影」，但却又以一種綣戀的情緒，以一種沒落者對於過往的回顧的傷感，浸透着他的筆尖；他把吉訶德描寫爲一個使人失笑的小丑般的人物，同時却又把他描寫爲一個理想主義者，一個不滿於現存的社會的人物（在盧那茶爾斯基的「被解放了的唐吉訶德」中，這種富有現代的意義的素質，就特別地被强調着。）他對於吉訶德這個可憐的騎士的嘲笑，可以說是被溶解愛中的嘲笑，是一種「含淚的笑。」</p>
<p>在對於吉訶德底侍從SanchoPanza的分析上，弗理契（Friche）也同樣地强調着他的二重性O　Sancho　Panza雖然好像被寫出欺瞞狡猾的人物，然而在實際上，這正是一個對立於貴族的理想主義的體現出農民的物質主義的典型，在盧那茶爾斯基的「被解放了的唐吉訶德」中，這種對比，是更成爲有力的明顯的了。</p>
<p>正如弗里契說的：「賤民代替了貴族了！」</p>
<h3>烟</h3>
<p>— 熾夏</p>
<p>近來，我的心境，往往容易流入無聊時節，隨便拿起一支烟來抽抽，就感覺到自己的生命有如那烟一樣的飄忽。</p>
<p>「烟！烟！什麽都是一層烟啊！」讀過屠格涅夫之Smoke的，想必記得那書的主角李維諾夫所說的這句話吧！</p>
<p>不幸的很，自己工爲生長在這個沒有希望的環境裏，若是沒有靈魂的話，自頗可以安適地渡過這個時代的，不過，略爲有點感覺的，就不然了，什麼都沒有辦法，什麼都可以使你煩悶，一切都如烟一般的迷霧，烟一般地倐忽啊！</p>
<p>現實是太醜惡了，這使應有理想的人，會感到如烟一樣的失望，正如Smoke小說的主角李維諾夫一樣，起初，雖則生長在一個惡劣的環境中，在他的心裏，倒底是懷有一片希望，不過自從他回家以後，父親死了，在古舊的貴紳的小邸第中，他只剩了一個人，他的心緒便陷於沉鬰，沒有希望，沒有熱情，並且沒有錢，他開始墾殖的工作，大家都知道墾殖是一種辦不到的夢，他最後的努力，碎了，於是他走入虛無了，一年過去了，接着又是一年，第三年開始了，偉大的理想漸漸地變爲現實的醜惡，不論是明的暗的，現在已不能掩飾地帶有灰色的面孔了。</p>
<p>這是多麼地肯像我們目前的狀態啊！正是一個活的寫照，烟，什麽都可以拿烟來代表啊！起初是很濃的，漸漸地淡起來，像做滑稽的遊戲似的，漸漸地伸長，漸漸消隱，原有的迷霧失去了，假的面具變了眞的原形，用烟的迷霧來騙人，騙自己，但是這欺騙是不久的，欺騙的結果，會使你陷於痛苦，一種失望的悲哀，夾着虛與的境情。</p>
<p>抽起烟來，往往容易發生這種思想，不抽吧！也不可能，因爲在這時代裏，也只有烟可以安慰自己，用以消磨痛苦的時間啊！</p>
<h3>龍燈馬燈</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>記得在小時侯，一過舊曆新正初五，便在期待着元宵節了，嘴裏老喜歡唱</p>
<p>「正月半，龍燈馬燈掉來看。」</p>
<p>小時侯不懂得什麽，祇曉得熱鬧，那時龍燈或是馬燈掉來了，人家便都會放爆竹來歡迎他們，有錢的牆門人家，還會在那時凑熱鬧的放了許多花筒筒、月砲，九條龍等等。</p>
<p>那時鄉下人的腰包，也似乎比現在要充實些，他們有這餘錢來弄這許多玩意兒，官廳也彷彿是俯順民情，不來管閑事的，所以精壯力健的年靑鄉農，在這一年內唯一的休息和娛樂的最末日子，便盡量的玩個暢快。</p>
<p>鑼鼓聲由遠而近的響了。於是各家的孩子，便都往屋子裏溜了出來，趕向聲音來的地方去。小孩子永遠是遊戲的熱烈擁護者，接着男子也出來了。然後是女人，和上年紀的人。</p>
<p>現在想想，其實龍燈馬燈都是十分單調，十分無味的。鑼鼓敲來敲去，老是那麽一套。馬燈的行進式，永遠是剪刀絞法。龍燈亦不過是轉東轉西，，龍頭往龍脚底下穿過去，或是往地上作一個打滾的姿式而已。動作眞是最要簡單都沒有了！而目簡單到使人嫌惡！可是鄉下人發了狂！鎭上的人也發了狂！少年老年全都發狂似的跑出來看，讚嘆！爲什麽？一句話，他們平日太缺少了娛樂！就像餓慌了的人，他祇要有東西吃，對食物再也沒有什麽選擇！</p>
<p>何况他們明知道再也不曾有比這更好的東西！</p>
<p>掉龍燈掉馬燈，不單是爲了自己娛樂，和給人娛樂。牠們是還有旁的目的的。</p>
<p>玩這許多東西的，大都是一般靑年的鄉農。他們有的是牛一般的體力，有時他們也許會給過份繁忙的工作累壞了。可是要敎他們在十幾天內，全不做事，祇是休息，他們也過不慣，他們是過不慣懶骨頭的生活的。他們喜歡勞働。抽黃烟，玩紙牌，捧着茶壺嗑閒牙，讓那般上年紀的父老們做去。他們喜歡做些吃力的，流汗的工作。那種工作才痛快！</p>
<p>掉這些燈不單要氣力，還要有膽量，這是鄉人誰都知道的冒險舉動。那一個村上的燈，掉到別的村上去，別村上的漢子，可以有充分的理由，或是說，不要什麽理由，就可以和他們尋釁，打架，把燈撕爛！所以要是去玩這種挑覺的遊戲，要懂一些拳脚還不够，還得有這打人或是被人打的膽量的，因爲結果打到傷重身死，並不是沒有的事。</p>
<p>或許你會問：爲什麽要打架？理由很簡單。就是誰都承認，玩這類燈的，在鄉人眼裏，全是英雄好漢，而同時誰都不佩服，誰會比誰英雄些。</p>
<p>玩龍燈馬燈，除掉來發洩那過剩的精力以外，是還含有發洩性慾的成分的。尤其是馬燈，馬燈裏有一個裝做「騷馬」，有一個扮做「賣婆」。這隻馬永遠跟踪着她，做出許多大膽的表情。而她也故意做出許多忸怩的抬人發笑的樣子。引那般男子大笑，引那般女人低駡。不過誰都喜歡看那種被「文明人」要鄙笑的動作的。</p>
<p>還有一個傳說，是關於龍燈的，據說當牠掉來的時侯，要是久不生育的女人，可以赤露了下身，用條竹布裙罩住，再抓一把穀悄悄的灑向龍頭上去。那一年之內，便可以有孕了。不過吃虧的是那個掉龍頭的人，要是他沒有立刻發覺，而敎這女人請利市的話，他會在一年之內大病，或是甚至病死的。這似乎龍燈又有帮助生育的大用途了。（完）</p>
<h3>戰爭雜記（二）</h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>「一個人一合的扶助糧就可以養得我們活嗎！」</p>
<p>一看見那作爲出征軍人遺族扶助糧而每月從區長那邊送兩三回來的僅少的米袋，母親總好像是給什麼人欺騙了般地憤怒着，把它丟開。她每天都用扁擔挑着巨大的簍子，到二十三團的兵營裏去担剩飯。她每天都把兵士吃剩的，或是燒糊在鍋底的飯，和剩下的湯等等，一担多少錢用投標的方法買了來。並且，把附近的同樣貧困的老闆娘們叫了來，將那些東西分給她們或是賣拾她們。</p>
<p>因此，自從父親出征以後，新煮的飯簡直一次也沒有吃過；但，無論如何，雖是蒸三蒸四的剩飯，我們總算沒有感到飢餓地過着日子。</p>
<p>第二年，我已經七歲，進了小學校。在畢校裏，無論是在遊戲的時候，或是在幹什麼的時候，先生們都教我們唱軍歌。</p>
<p>一個月只費一文錢，</p>
<p>一萬二千八百噸，</p>
<p>聞道是世界無其比，</p>
<p>名叫Ameuca　Boy</p>
<p>記不很淸楚；大概是這樣的語句。歌的調子到現在我還記得。從一年級生的時候開始，我們就每月給徵收了一個銅板的海軍軍艦建造費。</p>
<p>這種歌，的確是個在日俄戰爭中建造起來的，日本破天荒的大軍艦的祝歌。</p>
<p>那位姓津田的女先生，挺起巨大的快要臨盆的肚子，高舉着脚，揮着乎，用這種遊戲和歌兒來敎導我們。我們在先生的周圍作成圓陣，在歌舞的當兒，先生就敎訓我們，說是戰爭這事情簡直高貴到了不得，生爲人類而不去打仗，是要比廢人還要下劣的？</p>
<p>在無單純的童心裏，我覺得父親在外邊打仗這件事情非常値得誇耀；並且，在遊玩的朋友當中，也很有面子。</p>
<p>一天早上，在學校的校庭裏向天皇像行了最敬禮之後，校長就叫父親是個出征軍人的學生到講壇上去述說自己的感想。不用說，小學校的學生是不會在大家的面前述說那樣的感想等等的；都是由各主任先生在頭天把該說的語句叫我們背熟了的。一年級生的我，是第二個給校長喊到講壇上去的。</p>
<p>我心裏很着慌；只是照頭犬背熟了的語句盡量發出洪大的聲音說着。</p>
<p>「我的父親是個陸軍輜重兵第六大隊，輜重兵輜重運輸卒，德永磯吉，——」</p>
<p>我這麽一說，上級學生中的大一點的兒童們就嘻嘻地笑了起來。我莫明其妙，覺得怪難爲情的說不出話來了。校長就向着大家瞪着眼睛說：</p>
<p>「不准笑！」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>可怕的小學生肺病患者</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>這的確是一個不容忽視的極嚴重的問題！據前本市舉辦小學生結核菌試騐，有比德，西城，和安，旦華，及松雪等五校參加。試騐的結果，計五校受試騐學生，共二九一六人，已傳染者，計二一三七人，未傳染者，計七三九人，反應未知者，計四〇人。綜觀試騐後的統計，已傳染者，竟達百分之七十以上。單就五校二千餘的小學生加以試騐，已得到了這樣一個驚人的數目。若再將全上海市立小學校，全部舉行試騐，則為數之多，當更有可觀了。我國小學生患有肺病者，如此之普遍。這問題還能容我們忽視，還不算極嚴重嗎？</p>
<p>肺病是一種非常可怕的病症，小之可以殺一個人，大之可以滅一民族。故世界各國，對於這病症莫不十分注意。舉凡關於預防，治療，和杜絕等的方法，都極力講究。他們的看待肺病，無異像看待惡魔一樣，遠之惟恐其不及，除之惟恐其不遠。因為這種疾病，一旦任其傳怖蔓延，則個人的生命，民族的根苗，皆有陷於一個不可設想之絕境的危險！</p>
<p>獨我中國人，對於各種衛生，一向漠不關心。而肺病的症候，更成為極其普遍的現象。我國人之染有肺病者，若作一番精細的調查和檢驗，而加以統計，恐怕其數目也會呌人吃驚，或者不止百分之七十以上！</p>
<p>查肺病的致患，求源有二。一是先天的，從染有肺病的父母遺傳而來。一是後天的，由旁邊者肺病所傳染。我國自來關於婚姻的配合，十分自由，永不受政府的干涉。故卽使是患有肺病的男女，也可以隨便結婚。因是中國人所生出來的子女，每都有肺病的遺傳。此我國肺病者之所以多也。至若中國人之不講究衛生，隨地吐痰，也是造成肺病者增加的原因之一。</p>
<p>以此看來，防止肺病的傳染，就該從兩方面去設法救濟。治標的方法，政府應在各地多設肺病治療所，並勸人民充分注意衛生，及禁止人民隨地吐痰。治本的方法，政府對於人民結婚，應加以限制。凡男女要結合，須給醫生檢騐身體，持有健康證書者，方許共結婚。若患有肺病者，則應嚴厲禁止其結婚。這方法在外國施行很久，功效甚著，我國應從速取法。</p>
<p>對於這次檢騐過的小學生，聞敎育局已通知已注射而有肺病反應的學生家屬，令速自行治療，於相當時間後，再行檢查，限至三次勸吿，如仍置而不理者，卽命共退學。一方面衛生敎育兩局，為全市兒童健康的前途計，决於正在建築中的市立醫院內，籌設兒童療養院。這辦法是急要的。不過我們更希望敎育及衛生當局，在最近期內，對於全上海各學校，再舉行一次結核菌檢查，以便從事澈底防範。更進一步，我們要求政府當局對於肺病的傳染，加以注意，急速考慮根本的杜絕方法，肺病的為害，非常猛烈。深願我國人留心防禦，勿使其傳佈蔓延，為我國人的禍患！</p>
<h3>不如歸去</h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>（杜鵑一名子規，鳴聲凄絕，似道不如歸去，不如歸去。）</p>
<p>時間在日曆上飛跑，生命在漩渦裏打滾，聽呀！又是杜鵑啼的季節了。</p>
<p>是多麽動人歸思的音律呵！遊子們。</p>
<p>我的心深深地給感動了，是的，牠吿訴我：是回家的時候了。</p>
<p>接到玲的來信說：「快淸明了，父親的暮上已生滿着野草，你應該向來祭掃一趟。母親和我是多麽牽記你呀！還有你半年不見的藝兒，現在已會對着你的照片喊爸爸了。快回來吧！來接受人你兒子的稱呼。」</p>
<p>和杜鵑的啼聲一樣，我的心深深地給感動了。是的，我需要回去。</p>
<p>半年沒見面的故鄉呵！現在我準備重新投進你的懷裏了。</p>
<p>記得離去的當兒還是秋天，你是這們憂鬱地像話別時的玲底面龐，是多麽使人感傷呀！現在我快回來了，一定的，你會換一副裝束歡迎我。</p>
<p>於是我眨上眼睛想着—半年不見的田野舖着油綠的地毯，半年不見的樹枝，披着靑翠的外衣，半年不見的小河，澄碧地軟無力的給三月春風隨意玩弄着，在這裏還可以看到三三兩兩肥白的鵝兒舒適埤在洗操，一對對燕兒輕飄飄地在水面上窺者自己的倩影，一片片雲兒怪閒逸地在水底裏馳過。……是的，不像別時那樣了，和知道我回家消息的玲底面上一樣：充滿着靑春的微笑。</p>
<p>故鄉的春天我還這們稔熟，不知春天裏的故鄉還認識我不？那個人兒不像從前了，往年的孩子氣像秋天裏的落葉般的都給現實的暴風雨剝削光了，剩的是：枯枝般的軀殼和死灰般的心靈。</p>
<p>故鄉也許陌生我吧？可是我總得回來的，是父親死後的第一個淸明呀！我得站在他老人家的墓前致我誠虔的敬竟，我得吿訴他永別後的遭遇，我得細心地審察四圍的小草。</p>
<p>父親死後的母親是痛苦的，她把整個的希望放在兒子身上了。她關心兒子的安全比關心自身還加倍，偶然的小病是極對不願意兒子知道的，偉大的母愛呵「我有半年沒領略了。頭上的白髪又新添幾許？額上的縐紋又新添幾許？我得回去依在她的懷裏像少時那樣的，吿訴她在外面很好，呌她不要記惦，然後仰起頭看看慈祥的微笑在慈祥的面上展開。</p>
<p>有孩子後的玲憔悴多了，為着環境，不能替她僱個奶媽。於是關於小孩的一切都得她自己動手，那雙給勞作染成組糙的手眞使我不忍握上去，為誰呢？我只會自疚着。我不該再給別離的滋味她嘗，我得回去。</p>
<p>和玲對坐着，讓剛纔學走的藝兒蹌廛地　這兒到那兒。突然　他感到陌生地哭了，於是玲抱起來說：「是爸爸呢，不是和這裏一樣嗎？」說若指指掛在壁上的照片。</p>
<p>一雙小的烏溜溜的眸子看看壁上，看看我，再看看做母親的玲，他笑子，怪天眞地。</p>
<p>「爸爸」玲喊着。</p>
<p>「爸爸」藝兒學着。</p>
<p>故鄉的人物都在向我招手］我一定回去。</p>
<p>從經理室裏拿張告假條塡好，再整理着僅有的幾本書。</p>

<h3>河上夜宿</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>冬天的日子很短，我們的艒艒船還是蕩在寬闊的河心，烏鴉已是歸巢的時候了。自早上到現在，雖然動身時忽促忘了帶時計，這許多時候曲膝坐着，兩條腿已由酸痛而麻木了。袋中一盒殘烟，連襯紙都摺曡了小船放在幾十丈外的背後了。一種疲倦後的失望，我們不約而同打起呵欠來，舒展着兩條將要脫離本身的腿，但是船身猛地傾側了，那對年老的夫妻幾乎在船頭冲到河心裏去。</p>
<p>「先生，這不是玩的」！老頭子從河</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>底把篙子抽回來，一屈身，面對着船門口說。</p>
<p>「今晚到那裏下宿」？我所注意的這個問題。</p>
<p>「前面大槪有個小鎭，但是逆風逆水，搖不上勁。你們坐艙的不知船家苦，剛才險乎拋到河心裏去，天黑了，那裏去打撈」？說着努力地把篙子打到河心。</p>
<p>從艙門口探出頭來，那河道蜿　地向則伸去，好像永遠沒有歇止的時候。兩岸田畝中，被晚風吹動着，分不淸是人是草，一個塌毀的牛車棚，漸漸地向我們背後移動。把目光放到最遠的距離，我不見所謂小鎮的影踪。反受了船家的牢騷，心中憤恨起來。</p>
<p>「那鎭呌什麽名字」？</p>
<p>「好像—倒忘了，找個過路人問間看」。</p>
<p>心裏不由暗暗地駡了聲「見鬼」。坐了一天船，除了剛上船時瞧見一只獺皮狗在太陽底下打盹，就沒有見過一個人影，這時候倒說得稀鬆話？懶得和他鬥嘴，再縮進艙裏來。</p>
<p>天一會兒絕黑了。他們是以水爲家的，毫不介意地傍岸緊纜，在這荒野裏歇宿了。但是你能不同意嗎？提不起篙，划不來漿，而况四野裏是漆黑一團了</p>
<p>夫婦倆爬到船尾把煮飯的傢具靈數搬到岸上去，收拾一些野柴，問了我們要否吃他們的秈米飯，挺純熟地生了火。李媽那傢伙始終垜起嘴，現在大槪那肚子不能爭氣，把一切恐佈都丢在腦後，爬起身到岸上去了。</p>
<p>很舒適地吃了一餐飯，這是說在一天之中這個時候我能够伸手舒脚，而且肚子空了，那飯感到意外地香甜。不過問題接着來了，這一艘小小的艒艒船，如何裝得下這許多旅客，雖然老夫婦兩個舖了破被絮睡在船頭上，我們還是照舊屈膝而眠。</p>
<p>誰個都分外地疲乏，兩個工作了一天的船家，自然頭一着枕就呼呼地睡熟了。我們始終圖不上眼，一切恐佈都下意識地在腦海裏交戰，聽了遠遠的犬吠聲，好像不幸卽刻要發生在我們頭上似的，這是個亂世時代呵！</p>
<p>担憂着，提防着，等到第二天開船的時候，才安心地睡了；其實是再不能支維疲憊的磨折了。</p>
<h3>祭日</h3>
<p>— 四郞</p>
<p>「××！請快出來看舞獅子啊！」房東的小孩子在髙聲地呌，起先我以爲她是在哄我的，那來的獅子呢？故裝作聽不見，置之不理，可是，過了一會兒，房東太太也到我的房子裏來問；「那麼好看的獅子舞，爲什麽不看呢？」我才相信眞的是有這麽一回事，但，舞獅子究竟是怎麼一回事，我還是不明白。後來，經過了房東太太的一番解說之後，才知道這是日本一種祭日的景象，據說在祭日這一天，除了舞獅子的人到每一家的門前去舞了一回，算是送福外；在神社裏還搭起躉子來演戲呢。眞是熱鬧得很！於是我和房東的小孩子一道到神社逛去。</p>
<p>這一天，是個好天氣，晴朗的天空，掛着日輪，陽光普照大地，一切的生物都爲之欣欣向榮，枝頭的小鳥也爲之而歡躍，唱着自然的歌，誠然是個春已到人間的季節啊！我和房東的小孩子從家裏出來，跑過一個小邱，因爲神社就在邱的那一邊，一個彷彿是用兩個十字架合起來的石架，算是神社的第一道門，上面掛着一些像中國的廟裏用以驅邪的鏡子和瓷器一類的東西，兩旁滿植松柏，一片蒼翠；中間舖排石級，我們搶級而登，經過好幾個石架的門，才到達神社前的廣塲，廣塲上除了一座演戲的臺子外，還擺了一些賣食物和玩具的攤子，小孩子聚集得很多，有的還像中國鄉村裏的小孩子看遊神時一樣的穿着簇新的衣服呢。因爲臺上的戲還沒有開塲，我們便走進神社裏面去看了一會兒，一切的設置都和中國的差不多，只是比中國一般的神廟來得小巧而文雅些。尤其是那成羣的鴿子自由自在地在那裏跳來跳去，就有如希臘的敎堂那樣的幽靜而帶着詩意。臺上的戲開演了，我們在那裏站了半天，就祇看見一個打鼓和一個吹笛子的樂人蹲在廛上的一角在吹奏，那調子是古老的，莊嚴的，臺上的佈置很簡單，掛着兩幅門簾，擺着一隻矮桌子，上面放一碗淸水，還有就是兩把屬子；一個戴着老頭子的假面具人，身穿古服，手執朝板，不斷地在向着四方跪拜，依着那古老的莊嚴的樂調，做出種種舞蹈的恣態，再也沒有什麽新奇的戲可以看。呵！這便是日本所謂的『祭日』。</p>

<h3>落花生船</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>當我每次手中剝到落花生的時候，便會不期然的想起落花生船的故事來：尤其是有一只落花生船上的那個銀鬚的老頭兒，和一位梳著雙髻的小姑娘，直到如今，我還是時刻不忘的在懷念著他們。</p>
<p>落花生船上全是江北人，平日這些船是不到的，他們的行業除了賣落花生外，往常就是捕食魚或擺渡。一只艒艒船裏就算是一個家，起居飲食統統在這裏，便是生活也祇有靠著這樣一條破艒艒船。</p>
<p>在我們故鄉，每年一到了冬天，就有許多艒艒船，載著了一船一船的花生，停泊到前山後的每一條港裏來。每天他們便年揹了一蔴袋落花生，分頭到各村各巷去叫賣；</p>
<p>「長生果呵！長生果要　」！在這個季節裏，隨便在哪一條街上，或那一條巷子，便能夠聽到這種短促而生硬的叫聲的。於是逗得一班孩子們，都向大人吵著要銅板去買長生果，而在長輩們卻不得不每天多破鈔向個銅板了。</p>
<p>他們把落花生銷完了，女的就去替山礦裏敲石子；男人則去扒紅泥，或在灰窯上做小工。等到廢歷的新年頭上，他們卻合家老小在臂上挽著篾籃，或肩上措著布袋，挨家沿戶的去討糕　，跳獅子，唱搖錢樹，他們樣樣都做得到。因為鄉下人在新年頭上喜歡聽好話，而不願意讓人家咒罵的，所以只要他要會說會唱，添上一番「發財發福」的吉利話兒，那末一塊糕或兩個　子准不會使他們失望的。這在他們的確是一椿很好的投機生涯，每人出去兜了一天回來，至少也有十五六斤糕　。</p>
<p>記得在某一年的初冬，我們門前那條狹狹的小港裏也停著了一只落花生船。那只船已破舊不堪，差不多像快將沉下去了。船上只有兩個人，一個五十多的老頭兒，和一個　十二三歲的小姑娘，他們已像別只落花生船一樣，日間揹了落花生出去叫賣，晚上卻回來宿在船裏。不過每天當那老頭兒出去賣落花生的時候，總是留著這挽著雙髻的小姑娘在那船裏看守的。</p>
<p>那隻船停在我們門口日子多了，我也自然和那船上的小姑娘漸漸的認識起來了：並且軋起小朋友來，天天混在一起，我知道了她的名字叫小喜子；她是這老頭兒的孫女，至於她的爹媽聽她說已死了，她只知道死在水裏的，在那一年那一地方，以及怎樣死的她可全不知道，然而她的公公也不讓她知道。</p>
<p>我只要那老頭兒不在的時候，便願意跑到船邊去和她一起玩，小喜子也時常偷了許多落花生來送給我的。但是一見那老頭兒回來，我便溜回來了，小喜子也仿佛老鼠見了貓般的逃回艙去。那並不是那老頭兒凶，他並沒有叱斥過我們，他也是一們慈和的老人，不過孩子們見了大人仿佛多少總有些懼怕的心。</p>
<p>到了第二年的一月裏，他們也同別只落花生船一樣的開了出去，於是將我的伴侶—可愛的小喜子也帶走了！這時使我感到了無限的悵惘與寂寞，恍恍惚惚的像失去了一顆心一般。</p>
<p>這年冬天，那只落花生船又照例地來了，可卻沒有把我的伴侶帶回來，後來去問那老頭兒，他只冷冷的回答了一聲：「她已死了」！</p>
<p>第三年，的這個時候在落花生時節，更沒有見那老頭子的破船，我們門前港裏卻已換了別一只落花生船來。</p>
<h3>懷鄉病者</h3>
<p>— 景遙</p>
<p>在我們船上，有個老傢伙，人家都叫他精神病。我到這船上來底第二天，人家就告訴我：</p>
<p>「這具老酒鬼是個精神病。」</p>
<p>是的，他確是有點愛喝酒，衣袋子裏，老斜揮個酒瓶子。臉老那末紅紅的。每逢做事情，他都要從袋子裏拿出酒瓶子來，仰著頭，瓶口合在唇上，看那乾縐的膀子，青筯該那末幾滾，從喉頭傳出咕嚕咕嚕的響聲，幾大口酒，已竟進肚去了。馬上他那散光的眼睛也光影多了，做起事情也有勁。像不喝酒他就活不下去了似的。</p>
<p>說他有精神病呢，這卻也不見得。看那殼白頭發下的臉，老鎖著陰　的去似的。很不愛說話，也沒有人找他說話，他時常都很孤寂地望那遠方的海上。好像那海上的遠方，有他懷念著的什麼似的。也許脾氣有點古怪？精神病？我想這是造他的謠。</p>
<p>「別造孽了！這樣老的老頭。」</p>
<p>「真的！你不信？」告訴我的那位夥伴，被我激得發急起來，爭辯著。</p>
<p>「我以前也同你一樣不信，後來我就知道了。不信，我們來試試。」他拉著我站在甲板上那老傢伙面前。</p>
<p>「喂！老酒鬼……」</p>
<p>他正在出神地凝望那遠方的海上，二支手扶在船欄，全個身子微灣地向著前方。從旁看那蒼青色的瘦臉，是那末冷漠，不然的。看他這嚴靜的陰　的神情，真猜不透在他這衰老的身體裏，藏著那衰老的心，想砦什麼？懷念些什麼？</p>
<p>「喂！老酒鬼！你今天喝的酒好嗎？」</p>
<p>「酒？這算酒！我們家鄉裏，河套裏的水也比這強。」這老傢伙，說話也是這末冷漠的，他並不回轉他瞻望遠方的海上的頭，只微聳聳肩。</p>
<p>「那末，你什麼時候回家呢？」那位夥伴向我映映眼皮。</p>
<p>「回家？」這話像刺著了他的傷處似的，轉過身來反問著。他兩只眼睛燒著火似的滾著紅絲。臉是漸慘淡的。</p>
<p>「做回家的夢吧！回家？火車不讓白坐的。再退回十年，爬也爬回去；可是現在腿也老了！老了！」說到這那老年的悲哀，像海上的黃昏那末，浮泛上來。</p>
<p>「多少年前就想回家。也就只配做夢。你看這酒瓶子，跟了我這些年，我就憑他做夢，一喝了酒我就回家了。哈哈，老朋友！」他又拿出酒瓶子。</p>
<p>這老傢伙，把酒瓶子對著嘴，一邊咕嚕咕嚕的喝，一邊嘟　著：</p>
<p>「我有家，可好哪！有山，有水，有成群的羊，有漂白的雪，有大大的松樹，有紫微微的山葡萄，有比這好的酒，有……」</p>
<p>禁不住我就問了一句：</p>
<p>「你家在哪兒？」</p>
<p>「我家？我家就在那兒！」他用酒瓶子指著那籠在薄暮裏的海上。</p>
<p>在那遙遙的海上，有幾只海鳥在那兒飛。染了暮色的，那無限深遠的遠方，隱隱有幾點帆影出沒。</p>
<h3>伊洛瓦底江畔</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>除開兩季，椰林裏會揚過輕涼的伊落瓦底江的江片，長年的日子都在炙熱的太陽下慢悠悠的爬過去。當慵困的午夜，身上裹著輕滑的張江慢，躺在鋪著籐竹席的地床上，悠悠聽著金塔上的風鈴，散著寂莫的調子；椰林裏送出緬甸女人的歌聲，輕輕的和著低音階的鋼板琴，南島原始的靈潑風情，滲入了沉痛無告的亡國的悲哀，調子是悠長地拖著頭頭的聲尾，在寂寞的風鈴中慢慢的遠下去，遠下去。剩下一片懶意蔥　的椰林，松鼠唧唧的叫著，在椰樹的大葉上跳著滑稽的舞步。一種形容不出的困慵，輕飄飄的蕩著我的心，這赤道線的午夜，使我忘記了灼熱的太陽，異國飄流的苦味。</p>
<p>遠處，鴉聲淒楚的叫著。正是市集散市的時候，緬甸人的一天，又算寂寂寞寞的打發過去了。</p>
<p>走出門下，灼熱的凡從江上拂了過來。頭有些昏昏的。椰樹葉遮掩著頭頂的太陽，當江風微微的揚葉幹，篩下碎散的日影在青青的草地上。前面，波青的伊洛瓦底江，靜靜的縐著漣漪向東遊去。遠望對岸的椰林，也靜靜的蔥　地依著莊靜無語的青峰，看去一片翠綠。高空，是無逐的藍蔚，沒有一絲游雲。有時會飛來幾只山鷹，用著消遙驕傲的姿勢，盤旋而過。順著江流望去，遠遠的山光綠影，隱隱的切斷了如帶的江流。這時從上流悠悠而下的舢艇，白帆隱約，又隱復現的穿過椰林的葉影順流而來。艇上的緬甸舟人，光著梭色的背膊，舉頭呆呆的望著岸上的錄蔭也許正在羨慕椰蔭的陰涼，厭倦著痛苦的水上生涯。當白隱隱的沒在綠影叢裏，像一個吉蔔賽人的輕愁，咬著我的心，悠悠的唏噓起來了。</p>
<p>椰林的那逐，有著一條坦蕩的泥道，直向偏南的田野伸去，順著泥道望去，一片金黃豐熟的稻田，是收稻的季節呢這時，一輛車咿咿呀呀的蹣跚而過。車蓬內的緬甸女人，用著輕佻的笑聲，叫著：「德露，德露」。—中國人—……</p>
<p>牛車聲漸漸的遠去，遠去。突然，「鳴」的一聲，衝破了這瞬間的沉靜，一只掛著英國旗的輪船破江而去。靜靜的江面頓時激起不安的浪潮，白的水花濺著青青的草岸，嘶嘶沙沙的響著。橫空的濃煙，長長的拖在椰林梢頭，像一條黑色大蟒，盤旋在那裏，張大口，貪婪無厭的吞噬著伊落瓦底江畔的一切！</p>
<p>江面漸漸的平靜下去。遠處，又飛起淒楚的雅叫。金塔上的風鈴還是散著寂莫的調子。長年的日子都在炙熱的太陽下慢慢的爬去，而今又是收稻的季節呢。然而，幾十世代的無厭的榨壓，使得緬甸人只有躲在椰林裏支撐著結工作磨碎了的身心，望著盤旋在伊瓦底江上的黑色大蟒，唱出沉痛無告的亡國的歌。</p>

<h3>「自殺」謠諑聲中琪恩哈羅對於今世之留戀（下）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>「再則我最喜歡穿睡褲。昨褲就是我的弱點。在知已的朋友家裏吃便飯我總是喜歡穿著睡褲去的。如果我今晚有宴會，一一定要穿晚服的話，我的晚服以及一切零碎東西，白蘭區早就給我預備好了，不用我說一句話的。但是等到非正式晚餐的地方去，想穿了睡褲去，她就告訴我睡褲都送到洗衣房裏去了，當然我的睡褲有一打多，決不會統通都到洗衣房去的。但是白蘭區不給我睡褲穿，我就只好穿正式的晚服了。</p>
<p>「打掃房間，本來是一個男僕的職司，但是自從白蘭區來了之後，她從來沒有讓男僕進過我的寢室，化妝室，和浴室。她總是親自打掃拂拭。我的內衣，襪子，手巾，以及一切親近肌膚的東西，她亦不肯拿到外面去，總是她親手洗滌的。無論我起身早，回家晚，她總是在我身旁。在我未安睡之前，她總是不肯去的。如果我請朋友來家用膳，遇到她的假日，她就不去。她不放心叫別人做她的職務。她能辯別人的好壞。遇到不可靠的人來，她總是在我的屋子進進出出，不離我的左右。她能尋出事來做，蹀　往來，而在暗中監視那個人。</p>
<p>「再則我生性疏懶，喜歡將今天做好事，放在明天做，白蘭區每天早晨常常提醒我，我應當做的事，或應當回答信。我：「好吧，我回頭就做。」白蘭區一定要等到「回頭」的時候到了，才肯罷休。譬如我答應了回人家的電話，到了時候，如果我不回那人的電話，她就將電話接通了，使我無法延宕。我的不失信於朋友，多半是白蘭區幫忙的緣故，雖然當時覺得她討厭，但是事後是很感激她的。</p>
<p>「白蘭區對於我，有深切的了解。恐怕除了我母親之外，沒有人再深切的了。她知道我的一切脾氣性格，習慣，嗜好等等。她知道我各種毛病，懶惰，健忘，浪費，常常不穿襪，穿著長褲走出去，今天做的放到明天做。她知道這許多，但是她仍舊是愛我的。</p>
<p>「凡是女子，當她們在男子面前，總有些做作的，無論他們是父親，兄弟，以及丈夫。這種做作，或是不在意的，但總是一種做作。等到她們到了自私室之中，在她門睡覺或起床沐浴或修飾的時候，那才是她們真正的生活，一些沒有做作的。在那個時候，在那個地方，一切的防線撤除了，一切的外罩剝去了。這才是赤裸裸女子的本色。白蘭區所認識我的，就是赤裸裸的我。</p>
<p>「等我離去了這個世界，到了別一世界之後，我亦願意她將這樣的我告訴人家，而我所願意記憶和留戀的，亦就是我上文所說的一切瑣碎之事，襪子哩，長褲裏——那樣的忠誠，那樣的細心，那樣的愛護很少能將筆墨來形容的。」</p>
<p>「奇怪的很，我昨夜翻檢著我的剪報簿裏面貼著報紙上的大字標題，記載著我的一生事積，有的確的有的不確，有的揄揚，有的護諷。我心想倘使我死了，這些事都會記憶的。我所要記憶，帶到另一世界中去的，不過是些日常小事而已。」</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅的等話說完了。她會自殺的嗎？自殺，自殺，都是於今世無所留戀的緣故。須知自殺終究是怯弱的表示，於自已無益，死後徒為人恥笑，至多不過博得人們一些憐憫。要不自殺，須能了解人生的愛，領略人生的美麗，和人生發生留戀，像琪恩哈羅一樣。琪恩哈羅這樣的人，決不肯自殺的。她能領略別人對她的愛護，期望。她不想負己，負人，負世。即或受著環境的壓迫和磨折，她亦不肯輕輕屈伏的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「英雌歷險記」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Adventure　Girl　大上海映</p>
<p>在許多所謂英雄歷險影片之後。製片商給我們又看到了這張「英雌歷險記」。這是對准了「去瞧瞧娘兒們怎麼歷險」，以及對前一類作品看膩了的人們，的「生意眼」。由這個「生意眼」中產生出的東西，倘若作什麼過高的要求，自然是恐怕難以如願的。</p>
<p>這兒，除了沒有嚴密的結構，沒有中心的故事，僅是旅行，客觀上為國家侵略，主觀上是自我發財的探險，這些上是和所有的同類作品，沒有多少不同的。</p>
<p>全片據說是依照女主角自已的著作，敘述她歷險經過的遊記製成的。雖也有著Herman　Ravmaker其人，說是曾經導演過，可是片子卻實在不夠高明，嚴格地說來，僅能算是配音的新聞片，或旅行紀錄而已。</p>
<p>以女主角瓊恩洛威爾——也就是劇中人—和一個水手蘇儀作中心，分著幾個段落，首先是從瓊恩們出發航行寫起，緊接著晚風狂吹中帆船失事，蘇儀落水，瓊恩泅泳救他。第二天清晨，瓊恩等在一只破船中，搜索得一幅記著寶石所在地的地圖，決計去尋覓。可是因船上的飲水斷絕，在口渴的困難中，不得不上岸去跟毒蛇猛獸決鬥，以取得飲料。由這過場到她們的目的地某島，和土人的女王，同去實石所藏處。因為偷掘寶石讀犯了土人的宗教神聖，與女王的祖先，被土人捉來活活地火葬。正在火焚嬌健之軀，土人慶祝勝利，當兒，蘇儀趕來救了她，再歷了些被窮迫的驚險，於是逃上自已的船來，揚帆他住。</p>
<p>故事雖不夠健全，可是總算是有些情節。導演者要是比較地能夠把它結構一下，運用點電影藝術的技巧的話，無論如何。總比現在所映出的好得多。</p>
<p>如今在銀幕上所映出的，隨處都可看到不通與愚拙的地方：如船身與艙內的什物，木的鐵的多舊壞不堪而那只藏地圖的箱子卻獨自完好。在畫面上告訴觀眾的明明是僅載了五個椰果回來解渴，可是接著卻是全解決了飲水問題後的敘寫了。蘇儀手中有一管槍，曾駭飛過無數野鳥的，可是在與女王的酋長副官格鬥，以及在被土人追得要命的多少次爭鬥中，她始終不會開一響。這是如何的不通啊！至於把所謂土人的女皇也者寫得那麼平庸得像一個專自跪拜的東洋下女，以及土人群中雜有穿西服的白人，這不但不真實，而且完全失去了戲的力量。從那個女皇的手足無措上顯著她是一個極沒有訓練的臨時演員。此外把並不怎麼奇美的溪景，茂林中的水流，無原則無必要地再三重複，在極危急存亡中寫開船，也必得從笨重地轉索機，錨索漸漸地出水，解帆繩，布帆一扇扇地漸升，然後再船動，這些上，完全看不出一絲有所謂剪接這手法。</p>
<p>要是說，也有些好處的話，那就是在前面描寫船中缺了水的困苦上，以貓的伸長了舌頭，腳抓著盆喋，以及人的困乏等場面，頗為深切與簡潔地寫出了無水中的遭遇。</p>

<h3>威靈登軼事（The　Iron　Duke）（八）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>吉帝道：「不要難為他。差　不在他一個人身上。」威靈登笑著走了出去。茀蘭茜斯的丈夫，是一個瘦長個子的人，年紀很輕，他大衣已經脫去，但是頭上還頂著帽子，臉上是滿面怒容。威靈登很客氣的請他坐，他亦不坐。威靈登笑道：「你的夫人的友誼是很榮幸的，你請坐吧。」那人氣咻咻地道：「當然，我不能盡聽你一個人的話。」</p>
<p>威靈登道：「我是軍人，我亦願意做一個正人君子，當然，你亦要聽你夫人的話的。」那人勵聲道：「你命令大家留在不魯塞爾，又寫信叫內人離開，什麼道理？」威靈登道：「好讓她回到倫敦，迎接你們回來。」那人又問道：「為什麼又沒有呢？」</p>
<p>威靈登正囁嚅著，說不出所以然來的時候，突然茀蘭茜斯走了進來喊道：「威伯，我告訴你……」她的臉色是灰白的，她的嘴唇有些微顫。她繼續著道：「我聽見那裏有戰事，我要去看一看。當拿破侖打敗的時候，我就在滑鐵盧附近。我有那個機會看威靈登作戰，你要我不去看嗎？」她的丈夫怒斥道：「這與巴黎有什麼相幹？」茀蘭茜斯道：「那末你說我愛威靈登公爵嗎？不差的，我愛他，但是並不像我們所懂得的那樣……你亦可以說是崇拜尊敬，因為將來有一天，歷史上會載著：他是一惟一的偉人，忠臣，勇士……」</p>
<p>「她說著，嗚咽地哭起來了。她咽哽著道：「但是，威伯，我心愛的還是你呀。」她倒在她丈夫的懷裏了。她的丈夫臉上的怒氣，亦頓時消去了。他狠命地吻著她。威靈登看了，微笑地鞠著躬，退出去了。</p>
<p>吉蒂在大廳上等著他。她說道：「亞塞爾，我想留威伯斯特在此用晚飯，你說好不好」？威靈登笑著道：「很好，誰要他肯讓茀蘭茜斯坐在我的右面！你呢，坐在我的對面。」吉蒂又問道：「你這次來家，能否多住幾天呢？」威靈登道：「我先要回到巴黎，將那個安諾勒公爵夫人安排好了再說。我現在可以將這件禍事的底細告訴你了。這就是那個女人的陰謀。她化了錢，買通了一個無恥的倫敦報紙記者，替她寫了這段新聞。她是無法可想了，才用了這最後的卑汙的方法」。吉蒂道：「那亦很可憐了」。</p>
<p>在巴黎的皇宮之中，路易照樣的坐在實座上。他那透著傻氣的臉上，照樣地現著惶惑不安的神氣。宮門之外，鬧著一片喧嚷之聲。一般暴怒的群眾，向著宮門逼近起來。他們喊聲震天，越近越高起來，路易慌張著道：「群眾越聚越大了。為什麼沒有人去彈壓呢？」安諾勒公爵夫人站在路易的身旁，一聲不響。她面色蒼白，心中充滿恐懼」。路易又說道：「你為什麼一定要叫我簽字，將南衣大將處死呢？依了我的主意，我是不肯那樣做的，不過現在人已經死了，還有什麼法子呢」！</p>
<p>安諾勒怒道：「為什麼？就因為我要你顯出你的威權來。你是一國之君。難道叛臣不該死的嗎」？路易無可奈何似的歎著氣道：「唉，只要威靈登來了就好了」。安諾勒傲然的道：「他是不會來的了。」路易又歎著氣道：「都是那個無聊的風流案鬧的。誰幹的那件事」？外面突然發了一個巨聲，暴亂的群眾已經擁到宮裏！</p>

<h3>British Envoy Calls on Concurrently Acting Foreign Minister Wang; International Loan Issues Not Discussed; Approval Expressed for Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>

The issue of international loans to China was not discussed. However, he made some inquiries regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. According to external sources, the British Envoy's visit to Wang was purely a courtesy call and did not involve any special mission. It is expected that he will reside in Nanjing for a relatively long period. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Envoy Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, accompanied by Chinese Secretary Teichman, called on President Wang at his residence in the Ministry of Railways at 5 PM on the afternoon of the fourteenth.

<h3>Xu Tingyao Returns to His Native Place After Visiting Wang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After meeting with President Wang on the fourteenth, Xu Tingyao returned to his native place, Wuwei County in Anhui Province. Before leaving, he said that he had gone abroad in May of last year to inspect military affairs in various countries for a total of eight months, passing through England, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. He inspected the military organization, military equipment, heavy industry, etc., of those countries. Speaking of the military organization of European countries, he said that their armies are all based on a conscription system. In peacetime, every citizen must undergo one to two years of military training. There are not many standing troops. In case of emergency, they can be called up at any time to deal with war. The people have a very deep sense of national and ethnic identity, and their vitality is especially united. This point is more advanced than our conscription system. At present, the military equipment of various countries is not particularly tense. Because their industries are developed, all equipment is gradually being built in peacetime and does not need to be prepared temporarily. The progress of heavy industry in various countries is astonishing, especially in Germany, which can be considered the leader of all of Europe. There are no fewer than 100,000 factories in the country. Although they each manufacture their products in peacetime, in case of emergency, each factory can manufacture military supplies. Therefore, in terms of national defense, heavy industry occupies a crucial position. The situations of England, France, and Italy are the same. Japan's heavy industry is also advancing very rapidly, surpassing our country by thirty times. Our country still has no construction to speak of. Regarding the report on the inspection of Italy, I sent it to Nanjing last year. Drafts for England, France, Germany, and Russia are being prepared at any time and are currently being compiled. After sorting them out, they can be submitted to the central government for reference. Finally, he said, "I have observed the people of European countries and, in light of the cruelty of the European War, I am deeply afraid that war will break out again. In the next two or three years, it does not seem that a major war will occur immediately." (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

The Central Political Council reluctantly complied with your wishes and allowed you to retire. I have worked with you for three years, sharing hardships together. However, the administrative affairs are too complicated, and I have not dared to trouble you. There are many things that rely on your instructions for discussion and consultation.

<h3>Remnants of Bandits Still Causing Trouble Near Yutian</h3>

<h3>The North China Water Conservancy Association Continues to Take Over the Haihe River Project</h3>

The Yongding River Project Funds Custody Committee, and 3. The North China Water Conservancy Commission. The first two agencies have been ordered to be abolished. The North China Water Conservancy Association will abolish the titles of Secretary-General and Chief Engineer and establish two offices: a General Affairs Office and an Engineering Office, divided into six sections: General Affairs, Accounting, Documentation, Surveying, Engineering, and Design. The original monthly expenditure of 17,000 yuan will be increased by 1,000 yuan to handle the Haihe River project. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At the breach in Shuangkou, Yongding River, water has flooded dozens of villages. The torrent follows the old course and enters the Haihe River through the Xinhe River, with silt flowing down, raising the Haihe River by two feet in one week. The Qujiadian control gate is useless because the water does not pass through the breach. The soil dumping project at Tahe Lake has been completely wasted.

Chiang Kai-shek also telegraphed to inquire about the truth. The provincial government has reported the facts. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Jiangsu and Anhui provincial governments' handling of the Jun-Kui opening has caused repeated armed conflicts between Xiao and Su counties, leading to tragic incidents and developing into a deadlock, with no solution.

Currently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered Shao Hanyuan, the administrative commissioner of the Tongshan District, and the Anhui Provincial Government has ordered Lu Peizhang, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, to be responsible for jointly negotiating a thorough solution. Commissioner Lu, accompanied by local representatives from Su County Chen Xuexiang and Zhang Fangqiao, arrived in Xuzhou on the evening of the thirteenth and met with Commissioner Shao to discuss concrete measures.

<p>Hua Deming, Director of the Hebei River Bureau, Dismissed for Incompetence</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the twelfth, the directors of the construction departments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, seeing that the situation of the Yellow River project was extremely critical, went to inspect the Jiugulu and Dongliaoqiang gates, and convened a meeting of all river bureau directors in Menggang. Because the Guantai gate is dangerous and difficult to close, it was decided: 1. Build a water diversion dam or a permeable dam from west to east. 2. Close the Dongliaoqiang and Jiugulu gates to force the main stream to flow north into the main river. The three provinces agreed on the first item without objection, but Hebei was afraid that Changyuan City would be flooded and did not fully agree. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Restricting Foreign Rice Imports</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Regarding the two issues of restricting foreign rice imports and whether or not to increase taxes on No. 3 Saigon rice, although no conclusions were reached after the Executive Yuan convened a meeting to discuss them, they have already attracted widespread attention. Let us first discuss the first point, the restriction of foreign rice. Those who hold an opinion on this matter, from the perspective of farmers, fear that the continuous influx of foreign rice will depress the price of domestic rice, harming farmers. From the perspective of the people's food supply, they fear that once imports are restricted, rice merchants will manipulate the market, causing rice prices to skyrocket and leading to food shortages. Therefore, they are hesitant and unable to make a decision. As for the issue of whether or not to increase taxes on No. 3 Saigon rice, most people advocate for lower rice prices, arguing that taxation will make rice more expensive, which will hinder the people's food supply, and therefore oppose an increase. However, they do not consider the reasons for importing and taxing foreign rice, or whether or not taxes should be increased. They merely accuse rice merchants of profiteering, which only invites ridicule from the rice merchants themselves.</p>
<p>Originally, the issue of high or low grain prices is one of conflicting interests. Low grain prices hurt farmers, while high grain prices hurt the people. For three thousand years, this has been the common sentiment. Even the ever-normal granary system, while logical in theory, may not be entirely satisfactory in practice. Governing the law and governing the people are inherently difficult to reconcile. Therefore, discussing the people's food supply, especially in the current situation, is even more challenging to find a solution. However, one should not abandon the search for a solution simply because there is no easy answer. For example, what should be done with the large quantities of foreign rice currently in Shanghai? The central government is already considering this matter and will surely come up with a solution soon. Before this solution is revealed, let me briefly describe my own ideas.</p>
<p>Before discussing this issue, we must first examine the current rice prices in the city. Recently, rice prices have been quite stable and sluggish. However, the reasons for this stability and sluggishness, as far as I can surmise, are no more than: (1) The large quantities of foreign rice, mostly imported in March and April, require payment and delivery, causing a tight money supply. Merchants are forced to sell quickly to repay the import rice payments. This is due to the influx of foreign rice and the tight money supply. (2) Domestic rice that was stockpiled in previous years is difficult to store for long due to this year's tight money supply. If the rice is used as collateral for loans, it must be sold when the loan term expires. Thus, domestic rice is also sluggish. (3) The weather is gradually getting hotter. Although the mildew season is still far off, there is fear that the rice will spoil due to the heat, making it more advantageous to clear it out of the warehouses early. In addition to this, (4) there is also the psychological effect. Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been warm and there is hope for a good spring harvest. People fear that future rice prices will not be favorable. (5) The rural economy has been bankrupt for a long time. People cannot afford to buy rice when it is expensive, nor do they have the ability to buy it when it is cheap. Transactions are not as robust as in previous years, so stockpiles are growing thicker by the day, while sales are becoming increasingly sparse. Thus, rice prices are stable and sluggish. However, from the perspective of the people's food supply, stability and sluggishness are certainly a blessing. From the perspective of the market and finance, stockpiles are stagnant and there is no outlet. The money supply is bound to be strained. If there is any disturbance, the result will still be losses for domestic businesses, while foreigners will have already pocketed the profits. Therefore, even if there is an outlet for foreign rice, purchasing more foreign rice from an economic standpoint means paying more money to foreign countries, which is akin to drinking poison to quench thirst. If the outlet is not robust, then these 6 million dan of rice will still be a problem. If restrictions are not imposed and merchants are allowed to act freely, not only should we avoid purchasing more foreign goods under these circumstances to exacerbate the financial crisis, but we must also consider the future of our agricultural products and avoid increasing the pressure on them. Therefore, from the perspective of Shanghai alone, temporarily restricting the ordering of foreign rice would not be a bad idea.</p>
<p>However, how should we restrict the ordering? If restrictions are unsuccessful, what methods should be used to handle it? If restrictions are successful, but rice prices rise, what tactics should be used to stabilize them? These are questions that are indeed difficult to answer. Some say that it is not difficult, that the Social Affairs Bureau need only stop registering. But what kind of effect does the Social Affairs Bureau's registration have? It is merely intended to know the amount of rice entering and leaving the city, in order to regulate the market. If registration is stopped, can sales in the market be prohibited? Will customs not allow imports? No, it cannot. Therefore, the so-called stopping registration is merely a temporary measure taken in the absence of a better solution. It is not an effective method. Even if registration is stopped and sales are prohibited, it will only increase disputes and not solve the problem. Moreover, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreign merchants reside together, so the situation should be considered differently. Therefore, whether or not to register cannot restrict continued purchases. The only method is to advise merchants not to order anymore. But how can this be effective? If rice prices are stable and sluggish, merchants will not buy even without advice. If rice prices rise, although there is the threat of punishment, it will not outweigh their desire to profit, and they will inevitably try their luck. Moreover, foreign merchants aim to do business. If China needs it, they might as well raise prices to sell. If there is no need, they are willing to lower prices to sell. Therefore, if China's rice prices fall, foreign rice prices will also fall. When rice merchants see that the price of foreign rice is suitable for sale, they will inevitably order foreign rice. How can these rice merchants deeply consider the future consequences? They only know that the current profits are indeed substantial.</p>
<p>The method of advising has been exhausted. The most effective method is naturally to prohibit imports without registration, as advocated by some. However, prohibiting foreign rice imports should be implemented uniformly across the country, which is difficult to achieve. Guangdong relies on foreign rice for its supply. Xiang rice is prohibited from leaving the province. Anhui rice cannot be used. If foreign rice imports are prohibited, Guangdong will be plunged into a food crisis. From this, we can know that it is not feasible. If it is limited to the port of Shanghai, not only is it unreasonable, but how can we prevent foreign rice from being smuggled in? If the prohibitions are not uniform, how can we prevent it from being loaded and shipped? This is already so difficult from a domestic policy standpoint. As for foreign relations, can we be sure that it will not provoke criticism and cause disputes? We cannot be certain. Therefore, prohibiting foreign rice imports has its difficulties in today's world where customs rights are not yet complete. If diplomacy is successful, prohibition is possible and restriction is also possible. Neither would be a problem.</p>
<p>Before freely prohibiting its import, a more feasible method is the import permit system. Those who purchase foreign grain must obtain a passport. Customs releases goods based on the passport. When deemed unnecessary, the issuance of passports is stopped and imports cease naturally. When this system is implemented, it is necessary to understand the production of grain, the consumption of the people, and the supply and demand of the market. The difficulty still lies in whether or not prohibiting imports will cause additional problems. The difference is that there is no explicit prohibition of imports. It is only treated the same as military equipment and the like. Implementation seems easier. With this method, Guangdong and Shanghai can handle it separately. Guangdong can continue to issue passports, while Shanghai can stop issuing them. The foreign rice that has already been registered should be issued supplementary passports. If rice shortages still occur after the foreign rice is imported, continued issuance of passports can be considered to facilitate purchasing. Fortunately, once a telegram is sent for foreign rice, it can arrive in two weeks. At the same time, to prevent manipulation by rice merchants after purchases are stopped, a detailed investigation should be conducted on the numbers for rice in a certain region for arrival, sales, and inventory. The arrival, warehousing, sales, and destination of the licensed foreign rice, whether it is in the local or other ports, must be reported at any time for verification. Then, if rice merchants have a clear record of manipulating and hoarding, it will not be difficult to stop them. As for the issue of whether or not to increase taxes on No. 3 Saigon rice, due to space limitations, it will be discussed in another article.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Opposes Participating in International Loans, Saying It Only Loses Friendship with Debtor Nations, Advocates Assisting China with Goods Instead of Cash</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Lewis spoke in the Senate today, strongly opposing the United States' participation in international loans to China, saying that if the United States cooperates with other countries to provide China with financial assistance, the United States will be forced into a disadvantageous position. "Furthermore, we have painful experiences with lending to foreign countries. Not only are there monetary losses, but the friendship with the debtor nation is also lost. Therefore, if we want to avoid losing money and the friendship of the various countries involved in loans to China, it would be better to assist China by other means. We can suggest that if China needs loans, it may as well notify us in advance what it wants to purchase. If we can supply what it needs, we can supply it in full on credit," he said. According to reports, although congressmen have made many comments to the press about international loans to China, it is the first time that Louis has formally raised the issue on the floor of Congress.

<h3>Germany Publicly Announces Reason for Establishing Air Force, Saying Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. Are All Expanding Air Forces, France Studying Joint Action with Britain</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The official foreign press agency today publicly stated for the first time that Germany has bomber planes. Yesterday, the German government announced that the German Air Force will be established on April 1st. Today, the foreign press agency said that the reason why Germany is re-establishing the air force is that Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. have not only not abolished bombers, but have also formulated air force programs, modernized them in an organized manner, and improved bombers to make them play a decisive role in war. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government notified Britain, France, and Italy, stating that Germany will formally organize an air force from April 1st of this year. This matter has caused many legal and diplomatic problems, which are currently being studied by the responsible personnel. It is investigated that this action by Germany, in addition to openly violating Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, also contradicts the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3rd. Germany had previously accepted the London Declaration as the basis for negotiations. Now that the negotiations have not yet begun, Germany is taking the London Declaration's permission for Germany to participate in the Sky Convention as an excuse to establish an air force. However, the London Declaration clearly stipulates that the Sky Convention can only be signed after all the proposals of Britain and France have yielded results. Now that Germany has taken this action suddenly, there is no doubt that it violates the spirit of the London Declaration. It is now reported that the British and French governments have expressed their unity and will declare to Germany that all countries whose armaments are restricted by treaties have no right to unilaterally change their obligations. Germany cannot be regarded as an exception. In short, this declaration is nothing more than a reiteration of the claims announced in the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7th. In addition to the above legal issues, this move by Germany has also raised political issues in future negotiations. The governments of the countries concerned will naturally act together in accordance with the spirit of the Rome and London Agreements. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Simon Scheduled to Visit Germany, Accompanying Eden on the 24th</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to travel to Berlin by plane with Lord Privy Seal Eden on March 24th to discuss everything with German leader Hitler on the 25th and 26th. It is reported that one of the issues to be discussed is recognizing Germany's re-establishment of the air force as legal, provided that Germany concludes a Sky Locarno Pact with Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, an Eastern European Security Pact with Poland and the Soviet Union, and an Armaments Limitation Pact with various countries. Simon originally intended to travel alone, but the cabinet decided today that Eden should accompany him. In addition to serving as Lord Privy Seal, Eden is also a British disarmament expert, and the two travelling together will also make it seem more serious. According to reports, Simon was originally scheduled to go to Berlin on March 7th, but on March 5th, the day after Britain published its White Paper on National Defense, he received a letter from the German government stating that the leader was suffering from a cold and had lost his voice, and asked Simon to postpone his visit to Germany. Many believe that Germany was displeased with the White Paper's mention of Germany's rearmament and therefore took this action. The date of Simon's visit to Moscow is still under discussion with the Russian authorities and has not yet been decided. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's official gazette stated that German Foreign Minister Neurath informed the British ambassador last Saturday that Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin had been postponed due to leader Hitler's ill health. It can now be arranged within two weeks. The British ambassador suggested that March 25th or 26th be the travel date. The German government has now informed the British ambassador that it welcomes the British guest to arrive on that day. According to a London dispatch, Foreign Secretary Simon will be accompanied by Lord Privy Seal Eden, and is prepared to stay in Berlin for three days. However, it is still undecided whether Eden will go directly to Moscow from Berlin, as negotiations between Britain and Russia are still in progress. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A Havas news agency correspondent in Moscow interviewed Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, asking if it was true that the Soviet government had invited Eden to the Soviet Union, and if so, when would Eden arrive? Litvinov replied that when the Soviet government officially learned that the British government intended to send Eden to the Soviet Union, it immediately instructed its ambassador to inform the British Foreign Office that it would be very welcome for Mr. Eden to visit Moscow, and at the same time invited Mr. Eden to the Soviet capital. However, the date of Mr. Eden's departure has not yet been determined. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) British cabinet members have now decided to go to Berlin on March 24th. British officials stated that the mission of the British cabinet members to Germany is to support the entire Anglo-French Joint Declaration of February 3rd. According to reports, there have recently been many malicious interpretations that the result of the British cabinet members' visit to Germany will cause the various key points in the Anglo-French proposal to be separated. This statement by officials refutes these interpretations. There are now various reasons to believe that Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden will be ordered to explain to Premier Hitler in detail that the British government believes that the issue of security in Eastern Europe and the issue of security in Germany's western border should not be separated. In other words, the British government regards all proposals advocating abandoning France and seeking an Eastern European security organization as out of step with the times. Therefore, the countries of Eastern Europe, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, firmly believe that various instruments for preventing aggression must be interconnected. The London side is reportedly very pleased to hear this. Moreover, British diplomatic circles once believed that the Eastern European security organization could be based on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, but they no longer insist on this view, believing that only the provisions of mutual assistance can give the countries concerned a complete sense of security. Assuming, as hoped by the general public, that Germany approves the above principles and recognizes that the Eastern Pact cannot be separated from the issue of Western European security, the British representatives will continue to discuss with Germany, in proportion to the degree of satisfaction obtained in terms of security, and consider recognizing Germany's rearmament. However, in any case, there is a maximum limit to the recognition of Germany's rearmament, that is, it cannot be recognized that Germany has military power equal to that of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's military power must cope with events in the Far East, and the danger on the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border is no less than that on its European border. In addition, well-informed sources believe that the recent order issued by the German government to transfer its civil aviation personnel to the military is a clear violation of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. Before the British cabinet members went to Germany, this move by Germany was only a response to Britain's publication of the White Paper on National Defense policy, so it is not worth considering. However, upon reflection, the purpose of the Anglo-German talks is to conclude a new treaty to establish a security system. Now that these negotiations are about to begin, Germany is unilaterally abolishing the treaties it signed in the past, which is truly inconceivable. It is still unknown whether Britain will lodge a protest through diplomatic channels regarding Germany's establishment of an air force, or whether it will negotiate face-to-face when Simon goes to Germany. However, it is certain that Britain will not remain silent on this matter. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British and French Parliaments Busy Discussing Military Affairs, Britain Building Fast Fighter Planes</h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party today moved a motion in the Upper House to impeach the government's national defense policy, but it was defeated. The mover, Lord Ponsonby, criticized the government's policy for increasing international disputes, causing an arms race, and hindering the progress of the disarmament conference. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha defended the government, saying that Britain's military strength only reached the minimum level necessary to protect the country, and the government would continue to base its policy on the League of Nations policy. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, members inquired about the government's current construction of a monoplane fighter plane that can fly at 275 miles per hour. According to Sir Philip Sassoon, Under-Secretary of State for Air, the government has ordered one such plane, and it can be test-flown approximately this year. Sassoon did not want to elaborate on the details of the plane, saying that it would not be convenient to do so for the public interest. Sassoon also answered questions about Australia's recent meeting to discuss the government's air defense policy, saying that he could not provide any information. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Army Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met today to discuss the issue of extending military service. The proceedings were quite intense. Independent Deputy Leber proposed a motion demanding that the government provide an explanation to the committee. The Socialist members stated that they had also made the same request without result, and that the issue of extending military service should be discussed by the Chamber of Deputies, not just studied by the Army Committee. The Socialist proposal was ultimately passed by a majority of twenty votes to eight. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Prospects for Naval Conference Dim as Countries Race to Expand Armaments</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared today that he believes it is "not very hopeful" for the establishment of an international agreement to limit the navy to replace the Washington Treaty. The Secretary of the Navy made this statement in response to a question as to whether France's intention to build a new 35,000-ton warship meant that an arms reduction treaty could no longer be established. Swanson said, "I still hope that it can be established again, but I am afraid that it is not very hopeful. It is now learned that both the United States and Britain are very willing to sign a new treaty before the Washington Treaty expires next year. At present, all countries are waiting for Japan to reopen the London Naval Talks. Because Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto once said that Japan will be responsible for requesting the reopening of talks in the future, Japan will naturally make a proposal at that time."

<h3>Spain's Five-Year Naval Plan</h3>
<p>Madrid: Spain's five-year naval plan is about to be submitted to Congress. The contents have been disclosed in today's official gazette, including the construction of twelve submarines, each with a displacement of 400 tons; twelve torpedo boats, each with a displacement of 800 tons; eight mine sweepers; two torpedo boats; and twelve speedboats. In addition, there is a plan to expand coastal defense, with a total cost of 447,000,000 pesetas. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy Actively Building Ships, Two New Cruisers Completed</h3>
<p>(Rome) The new cruiser "Eugenio di Savoia" will be launched tomorrow in the port of Genoa. The new ship is of the same type as the "Condottieri", with a displacement of 7,000 tons, equipped with fourteen 152-mm guns, six torpedo tubes, and a speed of 30 knots per hour. There are also two cruisers of the same type under construction, which can be completed next year. In addition, Italy is also building (1) two 35,000-ton battleships, "Littorio" and "Vittorio Veneto"; (2) six destroyers; (3) five gunboats; and (4) five large and small submarines. The Italian Navy Department is studying various new plans. For example, the old cruiser "San Marco" will be abandoned within this year and used as a target for bombardment. At that time, the sailors on the ship will abandon ship and go ashore, and all changes in direction and speed will be controlled by radio. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Greece Handles Those Who Betrayed the Party According to Law, More Than 300 People Subjected to Military Trial</h3>
<p>Athens: The entire order in Greece has now been restored, and railway and telephone communications have been repaired. The reserves that were previously mobilized have also been demobilized. What the Greek government is now striving to do is to deal with the aftermath of the war and severely punish its political enemies according to law. Therefore, the original decree protecting the positions of judges and public officials has now been ordered to be suspended for three months, pending investigation by the government authorities into whether the existing officials have any suspicions of siding with the enemy. Various societies of the Venizelos faction are also strictly prohibited. Army Minister Kondylis has also declared that most of the seats in the Senate occupied by the Venizelos faction should be dissolved. A national assembly will be held in the next few days, at which time constitutional amendments such as the abolition of the Senate will also be submitted to the assembly for a vote. Senate Speaker Konatas has already been detained. In the past twenty-four hours, many people have been arrested on political charges, including Konatas. Army Minister Kondylis advocates that the leaders of the mutiny should be severely punished. There are about 300 people who should be subjected to military trial. As for the mutiny leader Venizelos himself, the government has stripped him of his citizenship and will be tried in absentia by the court. His property and that of other mutiny leaders will all be auctioned off and confiscated. Venizelos's former residence in Athens will henceforth be changed to the official residence of the mayor of Athens. In addition, a person named Pistotrakis, who is a relative of Venizelos, is said to have used his property to support the mutiny party, and has now also been arrested.

<h3>The Future of Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since the delegation of Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon arrived in San Francisco, Washington is now anticipating that the preliminary plan to establish a Philippine Republic can be realized earlier. However, if the delegation requests to amend the Philippine Independence Act, there are still many questions about the future, as follows: (1) The delegation will accept the political provisions in the Independence Act, but hopes to amend the economic provisions. If the government cannot restore its prestige in the Senate, this move will not be easy. (2) It may request earlier independence and guaranteed reciprocal agreements. (3) Based on commercial equality, abandon the attempt for complete independence and seek a permanent relationship with the United States. US Bureau of Agriculture Director Gray told Associated Press reporters today that he had assured the Philippine delegation that he would cooperate in completing independence within three years, and after three years give the Philippines the treatment given to other countries.

<h3>U.S. Army Tests Robot-Piloted Aircraft, New Weapons of Air Warfare Constantly Emerging</h3>
<p>Oakland, USA: Today, a mysterious US Army aircraft, piloted by a robot, flew over the Pacific Ocean for three hours. According to official sources, the aircraft may "automatically" fly to Hawaii. The Army authorities are keeping this matter strictly secret, but it is learned that a number of officers were indeed on board during today's test flight, and may even fly to Honolulu on it. It is also reported that today's test flight was very successful. Observers said that if the Army can fly this mysterious aircraft from Oakland to Hawaii without human assistance, this move will be the greatest advance in the history of military aviation. In this case, if the United States encounters war, it can use this type of aircraft to drop bombs on enemy capitals without losing a single soldier. However, the Army has not yet admitted that robot flight has developed to this extent. It is said that the preparations for this test flight were very thorough, and the Hawaii flight is about to take place. The news reporters saw the plane add 1,600 gallons of gasoline, and the director of the Oakland airport ordered the Honolulu radio station to broadcast the letter E as a signal from 2:00 pm tomorrow. The plane should be able to receive the signal when it is 1,000 miles into the Pacific Ocean, and fly to the Honolulu Army Airfield according to the signal. The plane flew back today, at first thought to be due to machine failure, but it was later learned that this was a test flight to prepare for future long-range flights. It is said that today it flew 170 miles and has proven that flying to Hawaii is possible. The time of departure has not yet been announced, but the press believes that it may depart tomorrow afternoon. Those on board during today's test flight were Captains Hejink Bojer and Bisser, who are usually stationed in Honolulu. An Associated Press interviewer visited Karen to talk with the mother of Captain Bisser, who said that her son had been serving in Honolulu since September last year, but returned to Oakland on March 6th for secret affairs.

<h3>US Proposal to Strengthen California's Coastal Defense</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following the announcement of the conversion of the Sunnyvale airship base into an aviation training station, there are now further proposals to Congress to study plans to strengthen California's coastal defense. Three California congressmen have jointly requested the House Naval Affairs Committee to dispatch a subcommittee to the West Coast to thoroughly investigate California's defense issues. They also advocate that the Navy Department, if necessary, acquire the pier of the old San Francisco Pittsburg Steel Company. The subcommittee should investigate the naval commands of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and inspect the naval training aircraft field on San Nicolas Island, as well as the army's air defense equipment, such as Fort Rosecrans in San Diego, Rockwell Field, and the airfields in Los Angeles and Oakland. Special attention should also be paid to the army's railway heavy artillery for repelling enemies on the California coast. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Studying Monetary Policy: White House Three-Headed Conference; Silver Faction Seeks Legislation to Raise Silver Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt told reporters today that the currency issue recently discussed in the White House was only a study of the government's gold policy. The President also said that his conversations with Secretary of State Hull, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and Attorney General Cummings, apart from gold policy, were generally about the Supreme Court's gold clause case ruling. There were no resolutions made during the conversation, so they will continue to be held from time to time. A White House spokesman said that the outside world has overemphasized the President's currency talk. In fact, the President does not plan any changes. Wall Street also believes that this kind of talk is an indication that the price of gold will change soon, so the President made this statement to the press today to dispel doubts. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>British Pound Exchange Rate Rises</h3>
<p>(London) The British pound rose today due to the revival of demand from Continental Europe. London financial newspapers all said that countries using gold are now on the verge of lowering their currency values. Today, the forward discount rate of the Belgian franc has increased from 0.55 centimes to 0.75 centimes. Although the [Dutch] guilder is still stable, the Belgian franc can be regarded as a very weak link, as Belgium's export difficulties are increasing rapidly. Only France can slightly reduce its difficulties, but if France wants to make concessions to Belgian industries, it will be greatly detrimental to its own trade. Switzerland is scheduled to hold a citizens' assembly on June 2 to decide on the country's future economic policy. It is said that its policy can easily become a devaluation of the currency through exchange restrictions. In many aspects, France also has a tendency to lower the price of the franc, but it is generally believed that the current rebound of the pound is temporary and will eventually fall, because the current price of the pound converted into US dollars is inevitably too high.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Is Not Dead; Japan Is Accustomed to Fabricating War Reports</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 13th, Fukuda Kanji of the Minseitō pursued the issue of the erroneous report of Ma Zhanshan's death and his belongings during the suppression of bandits in Manchuria. Army Minister Hayashi replied as follows: The war reports from the battlefield do not necessarily have to be the same as the army's official announcements, so war reports are sometimes wrong, which is unavoidable. However, when the army reports this to the Emperor or publishes it to the world as an official announcement, it always adds some question marks. As for the issuance of letters of thanks, it was not because of the merit of killing Ma Zhanshan, but because of the merit of defeating Ma Zhanshan's troops, so the army's actions at that time were not wrong. Regarding the items held by Ma Zhanshan at the time, such as Japanese banknotes and Manchurian currency, Nagataki, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, and Okido, Chief of the Accounting Division, replied as follows: The items held by Ma Zhanshan were all dealt with strictly and fairly in accordance with the rules. Those that should be returned have already been returned, and there was no free disposal. (Denstu News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Chiang Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting Troops from Stationing in Confucian Temples</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang issued an order to the whole country on the 12th, strictly prohibiting troops from stationing in Confucian temples. The original order stated, (Titles omitted,) "A country must have a foundation in the heavens and the earth.

All inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame all come from its source and are nurtured by it.

The establishment of a country and the transformation of the people are of great importance.

<h3>Pacific Islands: US to Build Commercial Air Stations; Approved by Secretary of the Navy Swanson; Reserved for Military Use in Emergencies</h3>
<p>(Washington) Pan American Airways, in preparation for establishing air transportation between Asia and the Americas, had planned to begin construction of airfields on Guam, Midway Island, and Wake Island in the Pacific next month. This plan has now been approved by Secretary of the Navy Swanson, but the government reserves the right to occupy these airfields in emergencies. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department is today proceeding with assisting commercial organizations to install necessary equipment to open new Pacific air routes. International observers believe the Navy Department's approval of American Airlines' use of Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam as bases for the Asia-America air route is intended to use them as a foundation for naval and military airfields in the future. It is said that, according to the Washington Treaty, the United States is not allowed to establish naval and military air bases on Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam before 1936, but there are no restrictions on commercial airfields. It is learned that construction will be actively carried out on the islands to accommodate the takeoff and landing of large aircraft. A ship will depart from San Diego at the end of this month, fully loaded with materials, workers, and technicians. Because the islands are directly under the jurisdiction of the Navy Department, Secretary of the Navy Swanson has ordered the approval of the use of the islands, but the islands remain nominally under the Navy Department and can be immediately reclaimed from the airline in times of emergency. According to Pan American Airlines officials, the Asia-America air route will conduct its first test flight in mid-July. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Japanese Navy's Perspective</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese naval authorities are unwilling to comment on the news that the United States will turn Pacific islands into air bases, preparing them as powerful strongholds in case of emergency, and placing them under the control of the Navy Department. However, summarizing the opinions within the Navy Ministry, their view is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The opening of air routes by the United States in its Pacific island territories, making them contact points for commercial air routes, and providing all necessary equipment, does not violate the treaty, even during the effective period of the Washington Treaty.</p>
<p>(1) However, the United States Navy Department, on the condition that it can transfer all commercial equipment to the Navy at any time and use it freely, is essentially disregarding the treaty by equipping civilian airlines. (1) It is difficult to understand why the United States is publishing such provocative news to Japan. If other countries do not disregard the treaty, no matter what facilities they have, we will not feel any pain or itch. No matter how they threaten, we will never yield. (1) We only hope that before the disarmament conference, all nations will strive to reach new agreements. Today, the United States' words of provocation to the world are unacceptable in a peace-loving America. (Dentsu Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Han River Steamer: Ran Aground and Destroyed off Daishan</h3>
<p>First Mate Lost at Sea, Crew and Passengers Rescued; Steamer Worth 140,000 Yuan, Salvage Impossible</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The "Han River," a steamer belonging to the Xiamen Taili Steamship Company that plies the routes between Quanzhou, Shantou, and Wenzhou, set sail from Xiamen for Shantou. On the morning of the 6th, when it reached the mouth of Mayu Island in Shantou, it ran aground on a reef due to heavy fog at sea, which obscured its direction. It was immediately stuck and could not move. At the time, it was thought to be a minor issue, and it was planned to unload the cargo to lighten the ship and hopefully pull it off. However, the wind and waves were very strong, and the hull was tossed from side to side. The areas that hit the reef broke instantly. Before the cargo could be unloaded, the bow had already taken on water and sunk, leaving only the stern exposed in an inverted position. Subsequently, the engine room machinery was also damaged and flooded. At that time, four or five fishing boats saw the situation and came to rescue. In the confusion, the first mate, Hong Shizui, jumped into the sea. The shipowner asked the fishing boats to rescue him, but they were unsuccessful. His fate is currently unknown. When the Shantou Customs received the report, they immediately sent personnel on a motorboat to rescue. They first rescued the comprador Chen Shiji and Jiehe Company manager Ming Naishou and took them to Shantou. The remaining 80-plus passengers and crew were taken to Shantou on four fishing boats. The cargo, including paper umbrellas, was lost. When the Taili Company received the telegram, it sent the "Lujiang" steamer from Xiamen to inspect. It found that the "Han River" was aground on the reef and the hull and machinery were damaged beyond repair. The boilers had floated up and could not be towed back, so it sailed to Shantou and took some of the passengers (some remained in Shantou) and the crew back to Xiamen. The "Han River" had a purchase price of over 140,000 yuan and had been operating between Quanzhou, Shantou, and Wenzhou for nine years. The captain was Hong Lu, the first mate was Hong Shizui, the second mate was Cheng Binghui, the chief engineer was Wang Jisheng, the second engineer was Chen Jinquan, and the helmsman was Hong Longgong, and others. The entire crew consisted of 56 people, and there were 28 passengers. Except for Hong Shizui, all have been rescued. Hong was over 60 years old and had been the first mate on the Taili Company's "Jiankang" steamer for a long time. There is no possibility of salvaging the "Han River". (March 14)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Branch Bureau Chief Leaving Post Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Li Ze, the chief of the Tinglin First Public Security Branch Bureau, allegedly released a morphine dealer. The Supervisory Committee of the Third District Party Department investigated the facts, obtained evidence from the detention book, and telegraphed the County Party Department to report the case. Upon hearing the news, Li first sent his family on the morning of the 9th, hiring a boat to Minhang and leaving. He also left the bureau that day and has not returned, leading to widespread rumors of desertion. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched Detective Captain Yang Shijie to Hangzhou to arrest him, but to no avail. He has already returned to the bureau to report. Since Li's departure, Jiang Jiankang, the district chief of the Seventh District, has reported to the county government by phone, citing the lack of personnel to maintain local security and the importance of public security relations, requesting instructions.

At about 11 o'clock the afternoon before yesterday, the ship was fully loaded with goods, coming from Changshu to Wuxi. When it was sailing through the area inside Guan Bridge, north of Houqiao in the Seventh District of the county, suddenly more than 30 bandits, driving two small boats, each holding pistols, knives, clubs, and other weapons, sped towards them head-on. They swarmed onto the ship, forbidding anyone from making a sound, and searched at will. After about an hour, they plundered and fled towards Lujiatang. After checking the lost items, it was found that the boat owner lost more than 100 yuan in silver dollars, 13,000 copper coins, 80 bolts of cloth from the Changshu Xinfeng Cloth Factory, worth about more than 400 yuan, as well as a large pawn package from a certain pawnshop, half of which was opened, worth about more than 100 yuan, as well as clothing, resulting in significant losses.

<h3>Zhenjiang: Provincial Treasury Borrows 1.5 Million Yuan from Shanghai Banks</h3>
<p>Since Zhao Dihua took office as the head of the provincial treasury, he has worked to rectify and reorganize the treasury. Although the province has suffered from rural bankruptcy and an unprecedented drought, causing a deficit in the provincial treasury, it has still managed to cope with various facilities and construction projects in the midst of extreme difficulties. However, the months of April, May, June, July, and August each year are lean seasons, with low tax revenue, while various provincial expenses cannot be delayed. Last April, the treasury mortgaged the province's business tax to the Shanghai banking community for 2 million yuan, which was repaid in monthly installments. It was fully repaid by February of this year. Now, the province is again mortgaging its business tax to the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Jiangsu Provincial Bank for 1.5 million yuan, to be repaid in eight months, with interest rates remaining the same. A contract has been established. This loan is originally for the use of provincial expenses, so it has not yet been used.</p>

After returning home, he incurred debts of several hundred yuan due to gambling. His father sold property to repay the debts and expelled him, severing their father-son relationship. After being expelled in the autumn of 1923, Yukang regretted his actions too late. He went to Hankou to make a living, working hard and living frugally, abandoning his previous bad habits. In 1929, he raised funds to open his own oil company. His parents thought he was dead in a foreign land and burned paper money for him every festival, but Yukang never sent a letter home. At 6:00 last night, Yukang returned to Zhenjiang from Hankou with his wife and children because he missed his parents. When they arrived home, the whole family was overjoyed and reunited. This can be described as a prodigal son returning home is worth more than gold.</p>

<h3>Letter: Letter from Shi Fangbai</h3>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper's Hong Kong dispatch on the 12th of this month, "Li Zongren sends Shi Fangbai to Beijing to meet with President Wang," which I found astonishing. Fangbai's trip to Shanghai this time was actually to return home to sweep the tombs and had no official business whatsoever. Moreover, Fangbai only stayed in Hong Kong for one day, and no one came to visit him, nor did he discuss meeting with President Wang in Beijing with anyone. Please correct this immediately to clarify the truth. Shi Fangbai bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce and Local Association Submit Proposal to Ministry of Finance: Contributing Credit Loan Measures</h3>
<p>Requesting Government to Promote Banking Industry Support; Each Allocating 2.5 Million to Form Syndicate; Banking Association Already Approved in Principle</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency: The government and the banking industry are jointly launching a 5 million yuan industrial and commercial credit loan program. The City Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance yesterday outlining measures for contributing to industrial and commercial credit loans. The Banking Association approved the principle at a meeting yesterday. The Money Exchange Association is scheduled to meet today to discuss the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Document from Chamber of Commerce and Local Association to Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Submitted Regarding a Request: Your humble organizations, previously believing that the Shanghai market is tight and urgently needs relief, discussed and formulated five measures: (1) Various industry bills should be discounted by banks and money exchanges. If there is adequate collateral, the banks and money exchanges should accept them. The Central Bank should also provide rediscounting to the banks and money exchanges. (2) Land deeds and business licenses should be added as guaranteed reserves under the Central Bank's bond program. (3) Land deeds and business licenses, and store ledgers should be sent as usual. However, the amount of credit overdraft should be determined independently. (4) Three banks should accept goods or real estate as collateral for loans or bill discounts as much as possible. The above five measures have been sent to the Central Bank, the Savings Guarantee Reserve Committee, and the two Banking Associations for adoption and implementation. Regarding items two and three, we have also submitted a request to your ministry, requesting approval for implementation. On the 9th of this month, your humble organizations received two emergency relief plans for industry and commerce from China Industrial and Commercial Bank of this city. After detailed discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the second type of material property appraisal mortgage loan in its plan is actually item five of the measures proposed by your humble organizations. We have already sent letters to the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Three Banks, requesting that they accept these mortgages as much as possible. The first type of industrial and commercial small credit loan in its plan is also consistent with item four of the measures proposed by your humble organizations. However, if the government promotes relief to industry and commerce from above, and the banking industry assists from below, then mutual linkage will be more effective. After discussion, your humble organizations have further formulated four outline of small industrial and commercial credit loan measures as a supplement to item four of the proposed measures for implementation. We respectfully submit them again to your ministry for adoption and implementation. Industry and commerce will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Outline of Credit Loan Measures</p>
<p>The four outline of small industrial and commercial credit loan measures are as follows: (1) The applicant for the loan, directly or jointly with industry and commerce, should provide the name, total capital, business status, loan amount, and guarantor's name of the small loan applicant to the Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association for verification and registration, and then forward it to the syndicate jointly formed by the banking industry and the government. After review and approval, the designated representative bank of the syndicate will provide the loan.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Met with the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing War Zone Issues and Hebei Province's Finances; Touring Shanghai's Construction, Heading to Beijing Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the Cangzhou Hotel. In the afternoon, he visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government and toured the construction of Greater Shanghai. He is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing today and then return north. When passing through Jinan, he decided to make a short stop to meet with Lu Province Chairman Han Fuqu. Yu's remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>War Zone Issues</p>
<p>According to Yu, various issues within the North China war zone have gradually been resolved. The issue of the withdrawal of the Japanese and puppet troops from Malanyu will be resolved once Military Officer Takahashi returns to Ping from Changchun. The issue of the transfer of new and old security forces has been agreed upon, except for minor disputes over the number of personnel. The issue of the reorganization of the security forces has already begun. When Li Jichun's troops were pacified and reorganized, the number of troops under Zhao Lei was originally set at 2,000, and the number of troops under Liu Zuozhou was also set at 2,000. The number of troops pacified and reorganized under Shi Yousan was 1,000. Currently, the actual number of troops under Liu Zuozhou exceeds the original number by more than 300, and the actual number of troops under Shi Yousan also exceeds the original number by more than 800, resulting in a lack of supplies and occasional disturbances. Now, Feng Shoupeng's troops have been transferred to Tangshan, Sun Jizhou's troops have been transferred to the vicinity of Tongzhou, and Liu Zuozhou's troops have been transferred to Luanzhou to facilitate the dispatch of personnel from the War Zone Clearance Committee for strict reorganization.</p>
<p>Yellow River Breach</p>
<p>The current Yellow River breach is in a precarious situation. The largest breach is in Guantai, and the first to be affected is Hebei Province, followed by Shandong Province, and then Henan Province. Changyuan in Hebei Province has already been completely submerged, and Puyang has also been affected. This is because the dikes and breaches of the Yellow River are mostly repaired during the winter when the river is frozen. The weather was warm last winter, and the river did not freeze, making repairs difficult. In addition, spring floods caused this disaster. Currently, the Guantai breach is 26 meters deep and 26 meters wide, making it extremely difficult to block. The Water Conservancy Commission is currently working with the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provincial River Bureaus to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>Hebei Province's Finances</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Luandong has become a war zone, and tax revenues have sharply decreased. In addition, local wartime expenditures have doubled, resulting in a deficit of more than 6 million yuan. As of now, the debt is only more than 1 million yuan. It is expected that the old debts will be paid off in 1935, and the income and expenditures will offset each other. As for construction, progress is limited due to economic constraints. The future construction policy will focus on water conservancy and roads. The Lingshou Canal, built last year, cost more than 400,000 yuan and is expected to be completed this spring.</p>
<p>Provincial and City Boundary Demarcation</p>
<p>The issue of boundary demarcation between Beijing and Hebei Province has not yet been resolved. The area of Beijing was originally more than 2,000 square miles, the largest of all cities in the country. It is now planned to redraw the boundaries, expanding the area to more than 16,000 square miles. A boundary demarcation conference was held in Beijing once before, but there were no results, and it has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Huang Not Fully Recovered</p>
<p>Chairman Huang Yingbai's health is gradually improving, but he has not fully recovered. I visited the provincial government in Hangzhou this time. As for coming to Shanghai, it was also to visit the Shanghai municipal government to learn from it. I plan to leave Shanghai and return north tomorrow, and I will make a short stop in Jinan to see the recent situation in Shandong Province.</p>
<h3>Gao Xibing Went to Hangzhou Yesterday; Returning to Shanghai in Four or Five Days and Transferring to Beijing</h3>
<p>Gao Xibing, a member of the Xinjiang Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department, went to Beijing to meet with the authorities and report on the recent situation in the new province. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 11th and has been frequently attending private social events for several days. He took a train to Hangzhou from the North Station at 7:50 yesterday morning to enjoy the scenic spots. According to those around him, Gao will stay in Hangzhou for about four or five days, then return to Shanghai and transfer to Beijing, taking the Longhai Railway north.</p>
<h3>Yu Jichuan Discusses the Use of Hunan Province's Bonds</h3>
<p>Two-Thirds for Building Roads, Rest for Repaying Old Debts; Finance Director Zhang Kailian May Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>National News Agency: Yu Jichuan, Director of the Construction Department of the Hunan Provincial Government, has been negotiating with the banking community in Shanghai on the mortgage of the province's construction bonds since his arrival in Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. The negotiations have been quite satisfactory. A reporter from the National News Agency met with Yu at his private residence yesterday and asked about the use of the bonds and the progress of the negotiations. Yu provided a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Issued at 98</p>
<p>According to Yu, the total amount of the bonds is 10 million, which has been approved by the Legislative Yuan and allowed to be issued at 98 starting from January 1 this year, named the Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds of 1935. There are 15 articles in the regulations: (1) The Hunan Provincial Government will issue bonds worth 10 million yuan to build roads and repay old debts to banks, named the Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds of 1935. (2) The interest rate of the bonds is set at 6% per annum. (3) The bonds are issued at 98% of the face value. (4) The bonds are issued on January 1, 1935. (5) The bonds pay interest twice a year, on June 30 and December 31. (6) The bonds will be repaid using a lottery method starting on December 31, 1935, to be repaid over ten years. The lottery will be held twice a year until June 30, 1945, when all principal and interest will be fully repaid. The aforementioned lottery will be held annually on June 15 and December 15, and the payment will begin at the end of that month. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit will send personnel to supervise each lottery. (7) The number of bonds to be drawn and the amount of principal to be repaid in each lottery are in accordance with the provisions of the attached table. (8) The Hunan Provincial Deed Tax and Business Tax revenues are the first guarantee for the bonds, and the operating income of the roads built with the bond funds is the second guarantee. The amount listed in the principal and interest repayment schedule will be allocated from the Hunan Provincial Deed Tax and Business Tax revenues on a regular basis as a fund for principal and interest repayment. (9) All income from the bonds and the principal and interest fund shall be stored in the agent national treasury and the provincial treasury banks. Representatives shall be appointed by the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan, the National Economic Council, the Hunan Provincial Finance and Construction Departments, the Banking Association, and the Provincial Chamber of Commerce to form a management committee to manage the funds. (10) The bonds are divided into four types: 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, and 10 yuan, all of which are in unregistered form. (11) The agent national treasury and the provincial treasury banks are the agencies for managing principal and interest repayment. (12) Bonds drawn in the lottery and matured interest coupons can be used to pay all taxes in the province. (13) The bonds can be freely bought, sold, transferred, and mortgaged. They can be used as collateral when guarantee money must be paid for official affairs in the province and as collateral reserve funds for banks. (14) Those who forge bonds or damage credit will be punished by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law. (15) These regulations will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Use and Allocation</p>
<p>The bonds are currently being negotiated with the banking community in Shanghai, and the cash will be mortgaged at 60%. The use is determined to be two-thirds for the construction of the Xiangqian Highway and the remaining one-third for clearing the old debts of Xiang Province. They have already been printed and stored in the treasury for use. Interest will begin to be paid in June of this year, and principal will begin to be repaid on December 31, to be repaid over ten years until 1945. A fund management committee has been specially formed. The committee members are Liu Hongnian of the Executive Yuan, Tang Chuanming of the Ministry of Audit, Yang Silian of the Economic Council, Zhang Gongquan of the Banking Association (represented by Lu Yuexiang), Finance Director Zhang Kailian, Construction Director Yu Jichuan, and Tang Gan of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce, and was officially established in February. The first interest payment of 300,000 has been allocated by the Finance Department and deposited into the committee.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract</p>
<p>I (Yu said himself) have discussed this matter with the banking community several times, and there should be no problems in general. However, the interest rate, term, guarantee, etc. have not yet been determined. I plan to make a decision after Finance Director Zhang Kailian arrives in Shanghai. Zhang has already taken a ship from Hankou yesterday to Nanjing, landed and took an express train to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive tomorrow night. If the bond mortgage can be established, Zhang and I will sign it together.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Sends Telegram to Central Government Requesting Removal of Jiangxi Province's Timber Tax</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry yesterday, (omitted titles): Recently, we received a letter from the preparatory office of the Jingdezhen, Qimen, and other timber industry associations in Jiangxi, which roughly stated: In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the government, in consideration of the people's suffering, abolished the special timber tax. The timber industry benefited, and the dried fish awaited resuscitation. Not a year has passed, and the Jiangxi Provincial Government has reimposed a timber tax for production and sales to help with bandit suppression. At that time, merchants believed that this was a time-sensitive tax and, in order to support the government's plan to suppress bandits, they endured the pain of paying the tax, hoping for cooperation between the military and the people, without asking for its removal. Now that the bandits in Jiangxi Province have relied on the government's power to be suppressed and eliminated, this time-sensitive bandit suppression tax should naturally be abolished with the elimination of the bandits. Who knew that the hope of abolishing it had vanished, and an order to double the tax on January 1 of this year suddenly arrived. Merchants and hundreds of thousands of people along the borders of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, who rely on this production as a source of livelihood, or rely on this work as a source of livelihood, will also be at a loss and await death. Therefore, merchants have telegraphed daily to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, earnestly requesting that the Jiangxi Provincial Government be ordered to immediately suspend the collection of this harsh and miscellaneous timber tax in order to emphasize production and restore construction. In response to this, we respectfully present this to your Yuan and departments for review and approval, earnestly requesting that you consider the difficulties of the people and quickly order the Jiangxi Provincial Government to suspend the collection of this timber tax in order to maintain the people's livelihood. Sincerely, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>London Art Exhibition: Opening Date of Preview Exhibition Decided: April 1</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency: The London Chinese Art Exhibition's preview exhibition has been repairing the old site of the China Bank on Renji Road in recent days, and the work of arranging the venue and restoring antiques has been very busy. Regarding the date of the preview exhibition, there have been various rumors outside. According to Gu Shusen, the association has decided to open on April 1 in order to have sufficient time for arrangement. The exhibition will last approximately three to four weeks. It is also heard that the association has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau requesting assistance, and the bureau has sent Zhou Shang, Jiang Wenbao, Shi Chongpeng, Xu Gongmei, and others to assist.</p>
<h3>The Shenxin Seven Factories Incident: The Mystery of the Purchaser's Payment</h3>
<p>The Key Lies Entirely in the Debt Repayment Issue: Rong Zongjing Says the Matter is in the Past</p>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reports that rumors have circulated about the purchaser of the Shenxin Seven Factories having made payment. A Hua Dong News Agency reporter revisited relevant parties yesterday morning to investigate. It is said that the aforementioned rumor is inaccurate. In fact, both the buyer and seller in this matter are part of the same organization. The key to resolving this issue lies entirely in the payment problem. Since this matter arose, after consistent negotiations from all levels of our government, HSBC has agreed to redeem the factories. However, they insist on full repayment of the principal and interest. Our side, after several discussions among Finance Minister Kong, Industry Minister Chen, Mayor Wu, and others, found that due to the circumstances, full repayment was realistically impossible. Therefore, they repeatedly negotiated with HSBC officials, proposing to first pay a portion of the interest, 250,000 yuan, and repay the rest in four installments. However, HSBC has consistently insisted on not allowing phased repayment. Until the deadline, the buyer falsely claimed that the payment had been cleared. Now, if our government agrees to HSBC's terms, redemption will no longer be an issue, it is said. Furthermore, sources have confirmed to Hua Dong News Agency reporters that no third party is involved in the turmoil. Since the Shenxin incident, people from all countries have been quite shocked, especially in this time of global economic recession. Although this sum of 2,250,000 yuan is small, in the eyes of most, the future business of the Shenxin Seven Factories cannot be managed as easily as it was under Mr. Rong Zongjing's management. Therefore, the current focus of resolution lies in the two issues of phased versus full repayment. As for the Shenxin side, up to now, they have not received any notification from any party. The factories are still operating as usual.</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that regarding the auction of the Shenxin Seven Factories, it has been rumored that the buyer has already made payment. Rong Zongjing told a Guowen News Agency reporter yesterday that the Shenxin Seven Factories were still operating yesterday. The auction issue is already in the past, and he hopes that the people of the country will not discuss it further. He only hopes that in the future, all compatriots will strive to use domestic goods and absolutely not buy foreign goods. On the one hand, he hopes that the government will implement the revival of rural areas, so that national cotton production will gradually increase. Then, Chinese-owned yarn factories will not need to purchase foreign cotton. If this is the case, the future of the yarn industry should be stable. As for the money owed to HSBC by the factories, part of the interest will be repaid first, and the principal will still be secured by the factory land and assets, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Association: Promoting Cotton Planting in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Commission has spared no effort in promoting the cotton industry in various regions. As a result, the cotton industry in various provinces has seen daily development. The committee estimates that within five years, it may no longer need to rely on foreign cotton. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that the number of cotton planters in the province is increasing daily and the selection of cotton seeds is extremely important, entrusted the Cotton Control Committee to procure several thousand dan of cotton seeds. It is also reported that other provinces have also sent letters entrusting the committee to procure high-quality cotton seeds. It is expected that this year's cotton harvest will be much larger than last year's. To investigate the national cotton industry's conditions, the committee originally planned to send personnel to various regions every year for investigation. However, to save expenses and time, it has decided to adopt a communication-based survey.</p>

<h3>The Cleaning Department of the Russo-Asiatic Bank Has Submitted a Lawsuit: Requesting the Seizure of the East, However, the Situation at the Wharf is Very Complex: It is Still Awaiting Court Approval</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was realized, in addition to our government's protest and planned international statement, the Cleaning Department of the local Russo-Asiatic Bank has officially applied to the local court to execute the seizure of the East Railway's assets in Shanghai, such as the Pudong Wharf, because it has an interest in the railway. However, the wharf has been registered at the US Consulate, and the situation is quite complex. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Application for Seizure</p>
<p>A few days ago, the reporter learned that the Cleaning Department of the Russo-Asiatic Bank had requested the court to seize the Yangjiadu Dong Railway Pudong Wharf and went to inquire. At that time, the spokesperson claimed that it was still under consideration, but yesterday it was no longer denied, proving that the application has indeed been submitted to the local court for execution, and entrusted to Chinese lawyers Yao Yongli and Yang Ruinian, and American lawyers Xu Li, Tai Weiss, and Lauton to handle everything. The reason for the request for seizure is that from October 1920 to the end of 1924, it had advanced funds to purchase railway materials, etc., totaling 589,637.52 yuan, but repeated demands for repayment have not been met. Now that the railway has been illegally sold, to protect its rights and interests, it has applied for execution of the seizure. However, according to the spokesperson of the bank, the court has not yet approved the application after the submission. However, the bank's legal advisor, Yawattendeski, believes that the legal basis for this action is quite solid.</p>
<p>Complex Relationships</p>
<p>However, the relationship of the wharf is quite complicated. According to reporter investigation, the wharf occupies 12 mu, 1 fen, 8 li, and 3 hao of land, with a width of 20 English feet, a riverfront of 450 English feet, a 300 English feet long pontoon, and a small warehouse and office. The total property value is 210,000 yuan. It is reported in the foreign press that it is worth 800,000 yuan, but the Russo-Asiatic Bank claims that it is not worth that much. It was registered at the US Consulate several years ago, with registration number 836. Therefore, it has actually become a four-way relationship among China, the United States, Japan, and Russia. Since Japan has declared that the Chinese Eastern Railway was purchased by a puppet state, Japan has no room to speak when the wharf is seized. Moreover, China has protested to Russia and declared to countries around the world that it does not recognize the illegal sale between Japan and Russia. Therefore, in law, China has the right to prevent the Soviet Union from transferring the wharf. However, since the United States is now involved, the problem is even more complex.</p>

<h3>Many Western Merchants Also Oppose Phone Rate Increases</h3>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company's rate increase plan is based on the company's slight losses in the past and its failure to reach a dividend rate of one point last year. Therefore, there is a proposal to increase prices. After the company submitted this proposal to the Public Works Department, the board of directors is considering it. According to the agreement between the company and the Public Works Department, the telephone rate increase may not exceed 25%. Therefore, the current rate of increase is 22%, with private telephones increasing from 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen per month to 8 yuan and 5 jiao, and business telephones decreasing from 12 yuan and 4 jiao to 10 yuan. However, the latter is limited to 100 calls per month, with a charge of 3 fen per call for exceeding the limit. Yesterday, a Public Works Department board member informally told a Hua Dong News Agency reporter that the matter is currently being discussed by the Public Works Department board of directors. After careful study by the foreign directors, they believe that the reasons are sufficient, (?) so they are likely to agree in principle. If so, the telephone rate increase may be implemented on April 1st.</p>
<p>Increased Rate Surplus</p>
<p>A Hua Dong News Agency reporter has learned that the Telephone Company estimates that after the rate increase is implemented, the number of calls made per month may be reduced by 50%. After the number of calls is reduced, the annual surplus will be 1,523,750 yuan. However, according to speculation from foreign business circles in this city, the number of calls will definitely not decrease after the telephone rate increase. This is because people are now only making calls that are necessary. Very few people are intentionally making extra calls. If the Telephone Company can achieve such a large surplus with a 50% reduction in calls, then the actual annual surplus should be double the Telephone Company's estimate, i.e., 3,047,500 yuan. At the same time, for this reason, people who want to borrow a phone to make calls will not be able to do so and will have to use public telephones. Therefore, the number of public telephone calls will also increase more than before, and the Telephone Company can earn more revenue, it is said.</p>
<p>Westerners Oppose</p>
<p>There is considerable opposition to the Telephone Company's rate increase in the city because it harms business and is unaffordable. There is also opposition from the Western community. Yesterday, the Shanghai Eacuange Brokers Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department board of directors requesting a rate reduction. The association also sent letters to various Chinese groups to gain sympathy. It is reported that the members of the association have a total of 900 lines. If the rate is increased, the losses will be significant, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wu Juenong Sets Sail Yesterday Morning to Inspect the Tea Industry in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that Wu Juenong, the director of the Tea Inspection Group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, previously went to Japan and Taiwan to inspect the tea industry because the Chinese tea market was being encroached upon by foreigners. He returned to China last month. Now, to continue to inspect the tea industry in various countries for reference, the National Economic Commission has again sent Wu Juenong abroad to investigate the tea production and sales conditions in various parts of Southeast Asia. Wu Juenong boarded the Dutch Java Mail Line's Tji Batang at 8:30 AM yesterday morning. According to Wu Juenong's conversation with a Shen Shi News Agency reporter before his departure, he was previously ordered to go abroad for inspection, but has not yet submitted a report to the ministry since returning to the country. This time, he will inspect the tea industries in Java, Ceylon, and India. Upon his return, he will write a detailed report, combining the information obtained with the previous materials, and submit them to the ministry and the National Economic Commission to improve our tea production and facilitate sales.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, in order to save the silk industry in Zhejiang Province, implemented control measures during the autumn cocoon season last year and stipulated various methods to restrict silk merchants from outside the province from collecting cocoons, resulting in the interruption of raw materials for various silk factories in the city, which successively suspended work.

<h3>Xiong Xiling Appeals for Disaster Relief for Jiangshan County Drought</h3>
<p>Two representatives from the Jiangshan County Relief Branch in Zhejiang, Yang Dezhong and Zhu Weichuan, came to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Rue Nanking yesterday to request relief and presented a handwritten letter from Mr. Xiong Xiling. A copy is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, suffered a particularly severe drought last year and was also ravaged by communist troops, making it particularly tragic. I recently returned to the county to visit relatives and witnessed the disaster, which I cannot bear. I am hereby submitting a report for your review. The county is located on the frontier and lacks publicity, so few people know the truth. Therefore, most of the groups providing relief are in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou, while only Xiaoshan County is in Jinhua, Quzhou, and Yanzhou. Jiangshan County is left out in the cold, which is very pitiful. Please provide assistance so that the disaster victims in the county can celebrate their rebirth. The merits will be immeasurable. [Signed] Xiong Xiling." Enclosed in the letter was a disaster report from Taijun, which is lengthy and omitted. It mentions that the disaster situation in the county, especially in Quzhou, is severe. Local disaster victims have exhausted their supply of bracken roots and are about to run out of food. They may not be able to survive until the wheat harvest. It is also heard that the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, recognizing the severe droughts in Jiangshan, Changshan, and Longyou, allocated 5,000 yuan last winter for emergency relief, which is a drop in the bucket and has been going on for a long time. Therefore, the spring famine is self-evident. However, all the association's relief funds have reportedly been allocated, making it difficult to cope, which is quite hesitant. However, it is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance to save these dying disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief and Universal Donation: Various Collection Points Enthusiastically Submit Funds</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Emergency Relief and Universal Donation Association has received enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life in the city, providing a great deal of relief to disaster victims in various places. It is reported that the association has recently received donations from various trade associations, factories, schools, and universal donation collection companies, shops, restaurants, and hotels, which are listed below. The Coal Industry Association donated 118 yuan in silver dollars. The North-South Goods Industry Association donated 50 yuan in silver dollars, including 10 yuan each from Tongfengxiang and Tongfaxiang, and 6 yuan each from Yuelaixin, Chengtaiheng, Shunchangqian, Zhisheng, and Changyuhao, which were collected together. The Copper and Iron Industry Association continued to donate 11 yuan in silver dollars. Workers of the Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 5 donated 180 yuan, 0 jiao, and 2 fen, and 1 li. Tongji University donated 109 yuan and 4 jiao in silver dollars and 160 jiao in small coins. Weimin Primary School donated 15 yuan in silver dollars. Lao Banzhai Restaurant donated 4 yuan.

<h3>Jardine Spinning Mill Labor Dispute Resolved: Party and Government Mediation Results in Workers Resuming Work Soon</h3>
<p>The Old Jardine Spinning Mill on Yangshupu Road in Eastern Shanghai and the New Jardine Mill on Weituoma Road employ over 11,000 workers. Due to the depressed yarn market, the factory decided through a shareholders' meeting to reduce all wages by 10%, leading to a reaction from all workers. Starting on the 24th of last month, strikes occurred successively. Although the Communist Party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate, no results were achieved as both sides held their ground. The situation has been turbulent in recent days and the situation is quite serious. The local Party and government authorities in Shanghai, concerned that the stalemate in the Jardine labor dispute was detrimental to local security, dispatched Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Committee, along with Zhang Chuqiang from the Social Affairs Bureau, to the factory again yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to conduct mediation. They summoned contractors Zhang Gensheng, Zhang Rongsheng, Ding Rongkun, etc., from the factory to inquire about the situation. Three solutions were then drafted: (1) Wages should be paid in full, with small silver dollars discounted at the full rate; (2) The contractors should come forward to welcome all workers back to work; (3) After this labor dispute is resolved, the contractors will guarantee that the factory will not dismiss any workers. The above solutions have been fully accepted by the contractors. It was originally scheduled to officially resume work yesterday. However, as the engine room and other departments in the factory still need to be organized, a formal announcement will be made by the factory to all workers to return to work after the organization is completed. It is expected to be resolved within two or three days.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Overseas Chinese Association</h3>

The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Plans to Establish an Overseas Chinese Affairs Office</h3>
<p>Jian Jinglun, Director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, has been actively handling overseas Chinese affairs in the city recently. He recently published the bureau's work and facility plans for this year. The main focus is on establishing a job placement center for unemployed returning overseas Chinese. Yesterday (the 14th), he convened a bureau meeting of all bureau staff to discuss relief and guidance measures, deciding on two matters: (1) It is proposed to establish an Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The bureau believes that the number of overseas Chinese going abroad and returning to the country is increasing daily. Overseas Chinese have been away from the country for a long time and often have little knowledge of the domestic situation, making them vulnerable to deception by local thugs. The bureau plans to submit a request to the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to petition the Ministry of Finance to approve the establishment of an Overseas Chinese Affairs Office inside the Jianghai Customs Wharf, dispatching staff to work there permanently to provide consultation and guidance to overseas Chinese, so that they will not be deceived. (2) To publish an Overseas Chinese magazine and convenient pamphlets. In addition to making efforts to guide returning overseas Chinese and promote overseas Chinese affairs, the bureau is still concerned about omissions and will roughly follow the methods of travel guides, listing detailed Shanghai concise maps and main transportation routes, as well as introductions to various major industries, commercial companies, factories, and clan associations. This publication will be carried out in cooperation with the Seamen's Union, asking crew members to distribute it widely so that all overseas Chinese know where to inquire.</p>

Since the beginning of this month, rickshaw pullers have been coming to register very enthusiastically.

<h3>Car Accident on the Shanghai-Minhang Road: Chen Adi Killed, Car Owner Flees</h3>
<p>On the 9th of this month, Chen Jingeng, who lives in Qiaojiaqiao, Fengxian, and suffers from epilepsy, had a son named Adi, only fourteen years old, who supported his elderly father by selling green onions and vegetables. On that day, he collected wolfberries and took them to Xinzhuang to sell. At about 3:00 PM, while returning past the Chang'an Cemetery, he was suddenly hit from behind by a car with license number 643 in the city and license number 5421 in the concession, which was speeding. He died instantly. This was witnessed by Li Rusong, an employee of the Chang'an Cemetery. The car owner, knowing that he had caused an accident, quickly drove to Minhang and abandoned the car by the riverbank, immediately fleeing with his servant. After an inspection by the Shanghai Local Court, it was confirmed to be true and an order was issued to prepare the body for burial and await the arrest of the perpetrator. Now, Chen Jingeng is heartbroken over the loss of his son and his old illness has relapsed. He is extremely miserable. It is now reported that he has also reported to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, asking for assistance to seek justice as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>An Old Man and a Young Man Die Pitiably</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Procuratorate reported yesterday afternoon that Jiang Pingyang, the head of the ninth ward, reported that there was a pit latrine in the Liu Tomb Alley in the nine acres of land. An old man went to the latrine the previous night. Somehow, he suddenly fell to the ground, barely breathing. Wang Amao, who was guarding the latrine, saw this and was shocked. He tried to rescue him but was unsuccessful, and he died soon after. Subsequently, a passerby claimed that the deceased was named Xia Jinsheng, 60 years old, and lived at No. 10 Gaoxing Lane, Tangjiawan. He was a coppersmith. The case is within the jurisdiction of the map, and it is appropriate to request an autopsy and burial. Also, Zhuang Hongkui, the security officer of the 24th ward and 20th district, reported that there was a young man about 17 or 18 years old in Yangjing West Town, Pudong. He had a dignified appearance, but was poorly dressed and suffered from a serious illness, lying on the road. Kind people asked him his age, place of origin, whether he had any family members, and why he came here. He claimed to be from Tongzhou. His father traded in Ningbo. This time, he was ordered by his mother to come to Shanghai from his original home to take a boat to Ningbo to find his father. Unexpectedly, due to his youth and carelessness, he was robbed of all the meager travel expenses he was carrying, leaving him in a dilemma and stranded in Shanghai. Unfortunately, due to his bad fate, he was also afflicted with illness. After speaking, his eyes were full of tears and his expression was extremely miserable, causing those who saw him to feel distressed. When asked for the detailed address of his hometown, he was unable to speak, only shaking his head repeatedly. People tried to send him to the hospital for treatment. However, the young man's illness was incurable and he was taken to a wasteland in Xiliukou in the town at about 8:00 AM yesterday to be temporarily placed, and he died soon after. Please conduct an autopsy, etc. For the above two cases, Prosecutor Wu Ying led examiner Xuan Zhiming and others to the scene to conduct an examination and confirmed that both had died of illness. An order was issued for coffins and burials.</p>
<h3>Ruan Lingyu's Funeral Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ruan Lingyu's remains were taken from the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at noon yesterday, arriving at the Lianyi Villa in Zhabei at about 3:00 PM. The funeral was held at 4:30 PM. When the funeral procession passed through various roads, many people stood and watched silently. The various events before and after yesterday's funeral are recorded below in detail:</p>
<p>Crowds of Tens of Thousands on Jiaozhou Road</p>
<p>Since Ruan Lingyu's body was placed in a coffin on the 11th, the total number of people who went to the Wanguo Funeral Home to pay their respects reached more than 100,000. Upon hearing the news that Ruan's coffin would soon be transported to the cemetery for burial, no fewer than tens of thousands of people gathered in the Jiaozhou Road area yesterday. The police station in charge of the area also anticipated that the crowds would definitely be crowded, so they specially dispatched a large number of detectives to protect the scene, and there were also many mounted patrols to clear the traffic routes. Before noon, the section of Jiaozhou Road, Avenue Road, and Connaught Road was closed to traffic, and even pedestrians were refused passage.</p>
<p>Relatives and Friends Went in Groups to Hold the Funeral Rope</p>
<p>In the morning, Ruan's coffin was still open, and relatives and friends who went to the funeral frequently went to pay their respects. Ruan's remains were slightly thinner and yellower than before, but still beautiful. There were many male and female relatives and friends from the Tang and Ruan families in the mourning hall. At about 12:10 PM, those who went to hold the funeral rope had gathered on the lawn in front of the mourning hall. It is estimated that more than 300 employees and friends from Lianhua and various film companies arrived. At one time, it was very solemn and solemn. First, a Taoist priest played cymbals to perform a religious service. Then, twelve employees from Lianhua Company and two Westerners jointly carried the coffin onto the hearse. It was led by a large horizontal banner with the words "Funeral of Artist Ruan Lingyu" written on white bamboo cloth with black edges, and the Shanghai Orphanage's full orchestra, and a hearse with a large photograph of Ruan, about six or seven feet high. Due to the restrictions of the police station, only 30 funeral cars were allowed. They departed at 2:00 PM and were still protected by a large number of detectives along the way until they passed the Xinqiao Shipyard.</p>
<p>Streets Blocked as the Hearse Passed</p>
<p>When the coffin reached Hengfeng Road from Jiaozhou Road, the streets were completely blocked by people and vehicles. After reaching North Baoxing Road, the traffic began to be slightly smoother. However, those who went to Lianyi Villa on foot or by car were continuously reaching several miles away.</p>
<p>Lush Cemetery: Artist Rests in Peace Forever</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM, the coffin arrived at Lianyi Villa. The portrait was moved into the Lianyi Hall. Those holding the funeral rope were treated to tea and snacks by the Tang residence. At that time, thousands of people had already arrived. The villa is a public cemetery run by a Cantonese man. The path is quite wide and there are many gardens and a sense of tranquility. In addition, it is early spring. The grassy fields, green willows, and red peaches seem very suitable for the long sleep of an artist. Ruan's tomb is located in the north. It is expanded with cement and is about two feet deep. Before Ruan's coffin entered the tomb, it was originally planned to open the coffin for a final viewing, but because there were too many onlookers at the time, it was feared that order could not be maintained, and it did not happen. It was immediately covered with stone slabs and sealed with cement. The funeral was then completed.</p>

<h3>Homicide Occurs in Western Shanghai: Elder Brother Stabs Younger Brother to Death Over a Boxwood Tree</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 PM yesterday, Liu Qiancheng, the police chief of the Sandaodi Police Station of the Xujiahui Police Station in western Shanghai, was patrolling with the police when he heard cries for help in the Panjiazhai area on the eastern side of the Zhongshan Road Railway. He immediately followed the sound and found many villagers. When asked about the situation, he learned that Qian Fugeng, a local resident living at No. 39 Panjiazhai and engaged in flower cultivation, and his younger brother, Qian Anan, had fought fiercely over a boxwood tree. Both men were now injured and lying by the river. Police Chief Liu saw that Qian Anan's injuries were very serious, and Qian Fugeng's head was also injured. He took the two men by car to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. However, Anan suffered two stab wounds in his chest, penetrating deep into his lungs. He died soon after without being able to be saved. The hospital notified the Xuhui Police Station, which took the murderer Qian Fugeng back to the station and detained him. At the interrogation conducted by the station chief yesterday, Qian Fugeng confessed that he was 34 years old and that the deceased was his younger brother, 29 years old. Today, his younger brother sawed off a boxwood tree planted in his garden. His mother, Ding, tried to stop him but he refused to listen and insulted his mother. His mother was angry and cried. He went home and learned about it. He reasoned with his younger brother, but it angered him. He struck his head with a rasp. He fled. Unexpectedly, the deceased chased after him and accidentally fell to the ground, causing the rasp to stab his chest. He did not hit him. After the station chief took the confession, he sent a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation, as the case involved human life.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case in Gaolang Bridge: Man Shot Three Times and Dies Miserably</h3>
<p>Near the Xiaocaichang market on Qiqihar Road, on the steps above Gaolang in eastern Shanghai, at around 8:00 PM last night, a middle-aged man, about 30 years old, wearing a Changqing silk robe, was lying on the side of the road, bleeding profusely and unconscious, barely alive. After the street patrolmen checked, they found that he had been shot three times in the back. The police quickly sent him to the Sacred Heart Hospital, but he died on the way due to his severe injuries. The police are currently ordering detectives to investigate in all directions.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Appeal Still Results in Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that Jin Xi, a young man who naturalized as a Korean citizen, has been detained by the Japanese Consulate for more than a year. Many people in Shanghai are concerned about him. According to reliable information, Jin Xi was sent to Korea after his arrest and sentenced to five years in prison. Later, a kind-hearted person in this city donated hundreds of silver dollars to hire a Japanese lawyer to defend him. The three trials have ended and he is still sentenced to five years in prison. Last month, he was sentenced to an additional eight months in prison for an unsuccessful prison break, bringing the total sentence to five years and eight months. His mother and widowed mother are still living in the Huimin Hospital in Xinmin Village, Malang Road, in the French Concession of Shanghai, and their lives are very difficult.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Derails at Xinlonghua Station: Three Cars Overturn, One Section of Steel Rail Damaged, Soldiers and Escort Police Injured</h3>
<p>The 801st freight train from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, scheduled to depart from Maigen Road Station every day, arrives at Xinlonghua Station at 10:15 AM to wait for freight cars from South Station and Richun Port Station to connect and drive to Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, at 11:25 AM yesterday, when the 801st freight train was turning around at Xinlonghua Station, because the freight cars from Maigen Road Station, totaling four cars, had not yet driven out of the No. 8 branch line, the driver did not notice the backward movement, causing it to collide with the freight cars from South Station due to insufficient avoidance. As a result, three of the four freight cars overturned, numbered 6169 and 60811, two heavy cars, and the 6144th car loaded with military supplies was also derailed at the seventh branch line, and a section of steel rail on the third track was damaged. Chen Guidong, a soldier of the machine gun company of the 589th Regiment of the 95th Brigade of the 19th Division of the Army, and Sun Huchen, an escort policeman from the Jiaza section of the railway, who were escorting military supplies in the 6144th freight car, were slightly injured on the car. They were diagnosed and bandaged by the South Station Medical Office. Fortunately, the station could pass through the first track for traffic and there was no obstacle. After the accident, the station chief urgently telegraphed the North Station's Transportation, Works, and Machinery Departments, asking them to send a rescue vehicle to provide assistance. Zhong Wenjiang, the chief of the South Station Transportation Section, accompanied by Luo, an engineer from the Engineering Department, and Han Shangying, the chief of the Police Section, led workers and others, and at 12:05 PM, they took the handcar to Xinlonghua to investigate. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, a rescue vehicle was sent from the North Station Machinery Department to Xinlonghua Station to carry out repairs separately. The goods that had been overturned in the freight car were unloaded by laborers. The damaged steel rails were then replaced, and the derailed and overturned freight car was jacked onto the track using a crane. It was completely repaired by about 8:00 PM last night and traffic was restored. Therefore, the 801st freight train was delayed until about 9:00 PM before it started to depart for Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Egg Exports Suffer a Sharp Decline: Proposed Tax Increase in the United States Not Yet Implemented, Egg Prices Plunge, Annual Loss of 10 Million, Hoping the Government Will Exempt Taxes to Enhance Competitiveness</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that China's egg industry is suffering internally from the impact of rural bankruptcy and externally from tariff barriers in various countries, resulting in a deteriorating situation for exports. Although the quantity has increased, the value has fallen to an irredeemable level. There are quite a few egg merchants in Shanghai, most of whom are small-scale operations. Only about 30 large egg merchants belong to the trade association. China's fresh eggs are usually exported from Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou. The annual export volume is very large, with a value of about tens of millions of dollars, making it one of the rural sideline industries. Recently, someone in the United States has proposed to Congress to increase taxes on Chinese eggs. At the same time, our Minister Shi also filed a protest. The reporter inquired with local egg merchants yesterday and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Source of Egg Products: Fresh eggs mainly come from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces. They are collected by small vendors in the interior and transported to Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other ports for export. The total export volume last year was 1.6 million dan. Approximately 40 million dan were sold directly in the country. Last summer, due to the drought, agricultural crops were affected, and the feed for chickens and ducks naturally became a problem. Therefore, since last year, the source of eggs from the famous egg-producing areas along the Yangtze River has also been greatly reduced. In addition, due to export restrictions, egg prices have plummeted. The total loss due to the price drop in the past year is more than 10 million dollars.</p>
<p>Egg Prices Plunge: In previous years, the prices of fresh eggs in the interior varied from season to season. In spring, each dan was from 20 to 17 or 18 dollars. In summer, it was from 15 or 16 to 17 or 18 dollars. In autumn and winter, due to slightly larger consumption, the price was from 20 to 27 or 28 dollars. However, in recent years, it has been only 14 or 15 dollars in spring, 11 or 12 dollars in summer, and smaller eggs are only 8 or 9 dollars per dan. Although autumn and winter are peak seasons, the price is only 15 or 16 to 21 or 22 dollars. The reasons for this are the infighting among the trade and the restrictions in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Exports: Among China's egg exports, the largest volume comes from Tianjin, followed by Shanghai, then Qingdao, and then Hankou. Eggs are generally divided into fresh eggs (chicken and duck), water eggs (including whole eggs, egg yolks, and egg whites), dried eggs, wet eggs, colored eggs, salted eggs, frozen eggs, etc. They are exported to Singapore, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, Japan, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, and other places. The annual business is quite considerable. In 1920, the total export value was more than 79.7 million, but last year it was only more than 30.2 million, a difference of more than one time. The following table shows the export volume and total value of China's egg products in the most recent two years:</p>
<p>Year Water, Wet, and Dried Egg Products Fresh, Colored, and Salted Eggs Total Value</p>
<p>1933 47,315 tons 354,662 pieces 36,079,624 yuan</p>
<p>1934 49,474 tons 319,545 pieces 30,243,526 yuan</p>
<p>U.S. Increases Egg Tax: It was previously reported that the United States plans to increase tariffs on Chinese egg imports. The reporter asked egg merchants and they said they only saw the report that U.S. congressmen had proposed it to Congress, and our ambassador to the United States also filed a protest. It is not yet known whether it will be implemented. As for the amount of Chinese eggs exported to the United States, according to last year's customs statistics, from January to November, the total amount of dried egg whites and yolks, as well as wet egg yolks, was 14,052 metric tons. There are no accurate statistics for fresh, colored, and salted eggs, so they are not included. The number is of course considerable. If the United States actually increases taxes, then we will have another layer of losses. Therefore, at this time of decline in the egg industry, what is hoped for from the government is that it can immediately exempt egg export taxes. What is hoped for from the trade is sincere cooperation, otherwise it will be difficult to compete in the international market and it will be difficult to avoid following in the footsteps of our country's silk and tea.</p>
<h3>Industrial Decline: Workers' Livelihoods are Precarious: Workers of Shenxin No. 5 Factory Demand the Factory Open, Workers of Meikang Silk Factory Oppose Second Wage Reduction</h3>
<p>The workers of Shenxin No. 5 Factory petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to open the factory due to livelihood reasons. The workers of the Meikang Silk Factory also petitioned the authorities to oppose the company's wage reduction. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shenxin No. 5 Factory: The Shenxin Textile Company's No. 5 Factory at 1316 Huade Road has more than 1,000 workers. The factory has not started work since it stopped work before the final accounting, and it is difficult to maintain a livelihood. They have petitioned the authorities, instructing the company to open the factory as soon as possible so that they can work. This morning, the workers of the factory sent representatives Duan Ruigen, Wang Yuqing, and others, more than ten people, to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting the company to open the factory as soon as possible. Wang Xianqing, a staff member of the Third Section, received them and promised to send staff to investigate and mediate.</p>
<p>Meikang Silk Factory: The Meikang Silk Factory on Haizhou Road, Yangshupu, has more than 150 workers, divided into day and night shifts. Since the factory started work this year, it has stopped opening the night shift and announced that wages for piecework workers will be paid at 70% of the original rate, and those paid by the day will have their wages reduced by 5 to 7 cents per day. All workers said that the factory had already reduced wages once in August last year, and now the factory is reducing wages again, making it difficult to maintain a livelihood. They sent representative Lu Zuguang to negotiate with the company, but there was no result, and he was fired by the company. Therefore, the workers sent representatives to submit a petition to the Party and government authorities for negotiation. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent mediator Zhang Chuqiang to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng Repays Debts on Behalf of Others: Couple Reconciles; Judge Persuades for Half an Hour, Record of Court Settlement Achieved</h3>
<p>Zhou Ruitang, a native of Ningbo and junior proprietor of Zhou Lin Ji Clock &amp; Watch Wholesale located at No. 15 Yuxing Lane, Nanjing Road, married Lu Sujuan, a woman from the same hometown, in March of the 16th year of the Republic of China through the introduction of Yuan Ludeng and others. After their marriage, they initially lived harmoniously and had a son. However, disagreements arose, and Lu returned to her mother's home in Ningbo, where she worked as a teacher in a church school to support herself. In total, they were married for eight years, but lived together for only two years and six months. Now, Zhou suddenly engaged a lawyer to file a suit in the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Lu. Lu also engaged lawyer Tang Youwei to file a counterclaim, demanding cohabitation and ordering Zhou to repay the seven hundred yuan in debts she had incurred outside in recent years. Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special Court had already held a hearing once, summoning them and advising them to reach an out-of-court settlement. These details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Zhang continued the hearing in the Fourth Civil Court, and Yuan Ludeng was also summoned to court to testify. Judge Zhang first summoned both the plaintiff and the defendant to the court, persuading them to reconcile. He repeatedly advised them, hoping that both parties would reconcile and continue to cohabit. Zhou seemed willing to agree to cohabitation, but was unwilling to repay Lu's debts, as she had left on her own. The judge told him that if he treated Lu Sujuan with sincerity, she would definitely not leave without a reason. Even though she had been living with her mother for the past few years, he should still provide for her livelihood. Therefore, this debt should be repaid on his behalf. However, Zhou firmly refused. Judge Zhang repeatedly advised him for half an hour, but Zhou insisted on refusing. The court then summoned Yuan Ludeng to the stand. According to Yuan, he and both the plaintiff and the defendant were family friends. There was no major animosity between the two parties, only stubbornness in their personalities, which led to today's events. He had once mediated a reconciliation, enabling both parties to reconcile unconditionally and avoid a rift. As for the debt owed by the woman, he would repay it on her behalf, and the man's parents would certainly repay him in full in the future. One day, he had invited both parties to dinner at his home, intending to have them return home together after the meal, so that both parties could save face. However, Zhou Ruitang did not arrive in time, so it was unsuccessful. Today, the only dispute is over the one hundred yuan debt. If he could bear this expense, a reconciliation could still be achieved. Judge Zhang deeply agreed with his statement and immediately summoned the two parties to further persuade them. Both the plaintiff and the defendant expressed their willingness to accept the court's advice and Yuan Ludeng's mediation plan, to reconcile and continue to cohabit. Judge Zhang further urged them to respect and love each other as husband and wife in the future, and not to act impulsively again, so that their future happiness would be boundless. After finishing his advice, he made a record of the settlement, which was signed by both parties, and then the court adjourned. This scene of a husband and wife cross-suing each other thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Trafficking in People Negotiated in a Teahouse; Fellow Villagers Truly Unreliable; Sentenced to One and a Half Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Wu Huafu from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, residing at No. 1067 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, has a daughter named Zhaodi, who is twelve years old and beautiful. Although Wu's family is poor, he loves his daughter very much. His cousin, Xu Ahe, from the same hometown, lives with him. Xu makes a living by buying paper ingots and ashes. Recently, he had malicious intentions and plotted to sell the girl. He entrusted a friend (named Jinfa) to find a buyer and peddled her to Ding Amao, a native of Ningbo. Ding immediately reported to Wang Xichang, a Chinese detective of the Yangshuqing Police Station, who disguised himself as a buyer and arranged for Xu to bring the girl to the De'an Teahouse at No. 6 Beishansi Road for negotiations on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 7:00 PM. Xu was very happy and falsely told the girl's father, Wu Huafu, that he was taking Zhaodi to the Sincere Company for fun. Wu did not know the truth and allowed it. They then went to the teahouse to drink tea and waited for a while. Detective Wang and Ding Amao arrived and spoke to Xu. Xu demanded a price of two hundred and fifty yuan before he would let go of her, and he would be responsible for everything. He was then arrested by Detective Wang and taken to the police station for detention. The girl was sent back to her father. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, detailed the situation and requested that he be severely punished. Wang, Detective Wang, then reported the process, and the victim Wu Huafu, witness Ding Amao, the teahouse waiter Zhu Shengyuan, and the girl Zhaodi all testified that it was true. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Xu Ahe to one year and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai Divorces "Confused" Woman; High Court Branch Pronounces Judgment Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai from Hangzhou had a love affair with Wu Xueli, the daughter of the late fortune-telling master "Xiao Hutu" (Little Confused), not long after representing her in a lawsuit. They then married in the auditorium of the YMCA in April of the year before last and lived together at No. 137 Maissier Terrace, French Concession. However, after the marriage, the couple's feelings deteriorated day by day, and within a year, they even filed mutual assault charges at the French Police Station. After mediation by relatives and friends, they each withdrew their charges from the Second Special District Court and restored their relationship. Soon, however, rifts reappeared. Cai then filed a suit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment to divorce Wu Xueli. The reasons he accused her of included (1) abusing elders, (2) hiding documents, (3) smashing items, (4) acting savagely, (5) throwing case files on the road, (6) secretly stealing seals and keys, (7) tearing up books and clothes, (8) illegally confining her indoors and preventing him from attending court, (9) using vulgar language and cursing, (10) secretly moving items, (11) wandering about without returning home, (12) deliberately wasting money, (13) doing her best to damage his reputation, (14) maliciously filing criminal charges, (15) using threatening words, and (16) plotting to harm his life, totaling sixteen points. The court summoned her based on the lawsuit. The defendant Wu Xueli was represented by a lawyer. After the trial, the court ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected. Cai did not accept the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, summoning the parties. This was previously reported in this newspaper. The Civil Court of the Third Branch of the High Court had already announced the end of the debate. Yesterday, Chief Judge Guo, together with Judges Li and Jia, held a court session and rendered a verdict, changing the original judgment. The marriage between the two parties was allowed to be dissolved, and the litigation costs of the first and second trials were to be borne by the respondent. At that time, neither of the two parties nor their lawyers were present.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a County Magistrate, Recruiting Staff and Swindling Money; Three People Deceived and Suing in Court; Defendant on the Run and Warrant Issued</h3>
<p>Ge Tianmin from Jinhua, Zhejiang, formerly residing at No. 12, Lane 105, Wenzhou Road, Xinza, this February, falsely claimed to Xu Mengzhou, Zhang Xiancang, and Xu Tingrui, all from the same hometown, that he had been newly appointed as the county magistrate of Nantong, and widely recruited staff. Zhou and the others had been unemployed for a long time and earnestly requested employment. Ge said that it would cost one hundred yuan and appointed Mengzhou as police chief and Xiancang and Tingrui as clerks. Believing it to be true, they struggled to raise twenty yuan each and handed it over to him first, saying that they would go to work in a few days. However, there was no news. On the 15th of this month, they found him in Room 324 of the Dahu Hotel and asked him for a receipt. Ge took out a letter of appointment from the Jiangsu Provincial Government from his side and gave it to Zhou and the others to keep, saying that he would notify them of the date of arrival at the post later, and then took the opportunity to leave. Later, they found out that the letter was forged, so they reported it to the police station, but there was no way to arrest him, and they were told to go to court to file a lawsuit. Zhou and the others immediately filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Ge Tianmin of fraud and obtaining money. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao came to court to summon him for trial. The defendant evaded and did not arrive. According to the statements of the three plaintiffs, Xu Mengzhou and others, they presented the forged letter for inspection. The court instructed that the trial be suspended and reported for a warrant to be issued.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Sues Husband for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Hu Wangshi, a young woman from Xuyi, Anhui, 27 years old, previously engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Court, accusing Hu Yunfei (31 years old), the owner of the Sino-American Department Store at Nos. 543-545 Avenue du Roi Albert and the Xishu Wanhexiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 6 Hede Lane, Xizilaihuo Street, of bigamy and abandonment. It is alleged that the two parties are cousins, and the marriage was arranged by Zhang Wanyi, Qiu Zhongshan, and others from the same hometown. They were married on November 18th of the 13th year of the Republic of China at No. 30 Sande Lane, Wansheng Bridge, and lived together. Later, Hu became prosperous in business and married another woman, Yang Suxin, and lived with her, abandoning her for three years. She requests an investigation. The court summoned him based on the lawsuit. The defendant denied marrying Wangshi, saying that although there were such words, they were not actually carried out. Later, because the spouses were incompatible, the lawsuit was dismissed through the self-prosecution procedure. Now, Hu Wangshi is unwilling to accept this and recently filed a complaint with the French Police Station, accusing Hu Yunfei of bigamy and abandonment, and requesting an investigation. The police chief approved the request and sent Detective Yin Baoke to investigate. Yesterday, the two parties were summoned to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case and filed a lawsuit for abandonment in accordance with Article 310 of the Criminal Law. The defendant was not present. According to the report of the bailiff, when he went to summon the defendant, he claimed that he had gone to Suzhou for something, so he was not summoned. Then, the complainant Hu Wangshi recounted the process of being abandoned. Judge Sun Pengxian verified the statement and announced that the defendant was not present today, and the defendant would be summoned again on the 19th for trial, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Zheng Yue, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, who arrived last month, held his official inauguration ceremony at 3:00 PM yesterday in the reception room behind the First Court of the Second Branch. Chief Zheng had previously invited representatives from various party, government, military, police, and judicial organizations in the city to attend the ceremony, and the Judicial Administration Department sent Shen Jiayi, President of the Second Branch of the High Court, to supervise the oath. The ceremony was grand and magnificent. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement: The hall was located in the reception room behind the First Court on the ground floor of the Second Branch of the High Court. The portrait and will of Sun Yat-sen were hung on the wall, along with crossed party and national flags. On both sides were party songs, oaths, and a table of ceremony order. The right side was for the supervisor, oath-taker, and party representatives, and the rest was for the guests. The hall area was not very spacious, but the arrangement was very elegant and tidy. The words "Hall" were written on the door for identification. The party and national flags were hung above the main gate of the court, and the national emblem was also displayed on the roof. The guest sign-in area was set up in the corridor at the entrance. After signing in, guests were warmly guided upstairs by staff wearing red ribbons to the reception room for tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>Guest Sign-In: After 1:00 PM, guests arrived at the court one after another, including Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Hanzuo representing the Garrison Command, Deng Peiyi representing the Municipal Security Office, Shen Xiqing, President of the Shanghai District Court, Zhong Shangbin, Chief Prosecutor of the court, Tang Zaili representing the Third Branch of the High Court and the First Special District Court, Ren Yi, Warden of the Model Prison, Sun Xiong, Deputy Warden, Guo Yunguan, President of the First Special District Court, Xiang Zhejiong, Chief Prosecutor, He Dekui of the Municipal Council, Gan Jingxian, Lawyer of the Municipal Council, Shen Junru, representative of the Shanghai Bar Association, and court presidents, judges, prosecutors, and journalists from the First Special District and the Second Branch of the High Court, totaling fifty or sixty people, filling the seats.</p>
<p>Inauguration Ritual: (1) The supervisor takes the presiding seat, (2) the oath-taker takes his place, (3) everyone stands at attention, (4) sings the party song, (5) pays the highest respects to the national flag, party flag, and Sun Yat-sen portrait, (6) the chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will, (7) three minutes of silence, (8) oath, (9) supervisor's instruction, (10) party representative's speech, (11) guests' speeches, (12) oath-taker's reply, (13) end of the ceremony.</p>

I resolve not to waste a single penny, not to misuse a single person, and never to engage in embezzlement or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to be subject to the most severe punishment. This oath.</p>
<p>Speech Outline: As the bell rang three times, the supervisor, oath-taker, guests, etc., slowly entered the hall and performed the ceremony as scheduled. Then, President Shen delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, saying that the duties of a prosecutor are nothing more than investigating crimes, filing public prosecutions, and executing judgments. But what is particularly important is the reporting of corruption and perversion of the law. If he abides by party principles, abides by laws and regulations, does not waste a single penny, does not misuse a single person, and never engages in embezzlement or bribery, he must practice what he preaches. Chief Zheng has always been honest and upright, and will certainly be able to fulfill his responsibilities and uncover evil. Then, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, saying that modern law is progressing day by day, and now we have good judges to enforce the law, represent the country in enforcing the law, and will certainly increase glory in the international arena and bring a unique color to the judiciary. Next, He Dekui gave a speech, and finally Zheng Yue replied, saying that due to the restrictions of agreements with foreign powers, he will do his best within his ability, and dare not be negligent. He is honored to receive the guidance of the supervisor and the teachings of all the guests, and hopes to receive more advice in the future to assist him.</p>

Because there was no suitable opportunity for a while, she temporarily stayed at Zhang's house. For some reason, Zhu Xia suddenly died in the attic the night before last. The incident was discovered by the police station in charge, who sent police to investigate. It was said that she died of illness. As the case involved human life, it was not convenient to be hasty.

Therefore, we should unite to promote our inherent culture and spread it to the world to prevent the tragedy of bloodshed caused by aggression.</p>

<p>(2) Prices In terms of prices, the wholesale price index and retail price index of the Gold Bloc countries have consistently shown a downward trend in recent years, with the most significant decline occurring in 1932. The impact of price drops on industrial production is undoubtedly significant.</p>

<p>(3) Production In terms of production, we can gain insight from the industrial production index of the Gold Bloc countries (1928 equals 100). In 1930, the indices of all countries except France declined. In 1931, they all declined uniformly. In 1932, the drop was even more severe, with the highest being 75.6 for France and the lowest being 63.9 for the Netherlands. Subsequently, although there was a slight improvement in 1933, it trended downwards again in 1934, except for Italy. Looking solely at the current year, the Italian index showed a sharp upward trend throughout the year. The Belgian index remained largely unchanged. The Netherlands saw its index rise above 79 in February and May of the first half of the year, but it then suffered a setback starting in June, falling to a low of 62 in September. The November index was only 63.9. The average index for the 11 months of the year was 70.9, similar to 1933. The French index showed a consistently straight downward trend throughout the year, starting at 83.5 in January and falling to 78.0 in June. The lowest point was 74.0 in October and November. The average index for the 11 months of 1934 was 78.4.</p>

<p>(4) Unemployment and Bankruptcies The rise and fall of unemployment and bankruptcy indices best illustrate the state of the social economy. Statistics on unemployment and bankruptcies in the Gold Bloc countries have shown an increasing trend since 1929, with the most significant increase occurring in 1932. Although unemployment and bankruptcy statistics in Italy and the Netherlands showed a slight decrease in 1934, they were still significantly higher than in 1931 and earlier. France, which had seen a slight decrease in 1933, experienced an increase again this year, reaching the highest record in recent years. The number of unemployed people increased from only 10,052 in 1929 to over 376,386 in 1934. The average monthly number of bankruptcies increased from 726 in 1929 to 1,214 in 1934. The increasing social burden and frequent business failures are hidden worries for the future of economic recovery.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xu Haowu)</p>
<p>The health of the body lies in the blood; the turmoil of society lies in money.</p>
<p>Blood must circulate; money is called currency. Local congestion will cause local or global organizational obstructions, which is not a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Colorful banknotes carry the same bloody odor. The difference is that the rich indulge in wine and women, and what they take without end is mostly the flesh and blood of others. They don't have the same poignant and pungent smell of sweat and blood that the poor exchange for their earnings while groaning and lamenting.</p>
<p>Because money is coagulated blood, gangsters use blood to represent money, and ordinary people regard money as blood. With money, even strangers are treated like sons; without money, one's own parents are treated like servants.</p>
<p>Money is blood; flies suck it up without hesitation. Are humans just the embodiment of flies?</p>
<h3>The Oldest Soup Kitchen</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>It is already mid-spring, and soup kitchens everywhere are either closing down or about to close down. This reminds me of the soup kitchen in Rugao County, Jiangsu—the oldest soup kitchen in our country.</p>
<p>The Rugao soup kitchen has a history of two to three hundred years, dating back to the Ming Dynasty. The kitchen has been able to operate until now thanks to the enthusiastic contributions of kind people, who donate rice or money. Rugao has always been known as "Golden Rugao." If you see a man on the street wearing a blue cloth skirt around his waist, don't laugh at him as an old man. He may have tens of thousands in assets, and that's a very common thing. Since there are so many wealthy people, it's not surprising that they would donate four or five hundred yuan to the soup kitchen. The most commendable thing is the staff who run the soup kitchen. They have no desire to profit or embezzle donations. Otherwise, with an anonymous donor donating 300 yuan and an undisclosed donor donating 500 yuan, it would be impossible to verify if they were embezzling funds, because the kind people of Rugao are unwilling to reveal their real names when making donations.</p>
<p>Every winter, poor people within fifty miles of the city load their entire families into boats and row to the vicinity of the soup kitchen to moor. They can sit and eat for three months. The soup kitchen does not refuse anyone. Therefore, when the north wind rises, the small boats in front of the soup kitchen are connected end to end, stretching for several miles, like a long serpent formation, which can be considered a spectacle. This cannot be done without a substantial soup fund!</p>
<p>The act of dispensing soup, if considered according to the principle of "benevolent governance without relief," may seem inappropriate. However, it is, after all, the intention of benevolent people, and the meaning cannot be faulted too much. Like the soup kitchen in Rugao, which has been able to continue for two to three hundred years, it is quite commendable.</p>
<h3>Jiang Kanghu's Discussion of Romance of the Three Kingdoms</h3>
<p>— Zheng Mei</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu lives in Qingliang Temple in Xin's Garden, not far from my residence, so I often have the opportunity to seek his counsel. The doctor knew that I was compiling "The Complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms," so he spoke about his feelings regarding Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which were quite witty and meaningful. Therefore, I recorded them on the left:</p>
<p>"I once read Records of the Three Kingdoms and felt that the Three Kingdoms period was truly a time of abundant Chinese talent! Wise rulers, virtuous ministers, brave generals, and resourceful strategists existed in each country. The talents of any one country were sufficient to turn chaos into order, achieve unification, and bring about peace. However, they ultimately failed because the other two countries also had comparable and equal talents, creating mutually offsetting and dissipating efforts. If the talents of the Three Kingdoms had been combined, the Eastern Han Dynasty would have been revived long ago. Even if any two countries had formed alliances to control the third country, the warfare would not have been so dramatic and prolonged. Therefore, each of the Three Kingdoms had talent, and the talent was divided among the Three Kingdoms, which means that Heaven did not want to bring peace to the world! I once again read Romance of the Three Kingdoms and felt even more deeply that the Three Kingdoms period was truly prosperous. However, the reason why the names and deeds of the figures are well-known to every household, familiar, and detailed is due to the popularizing power of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Before the Three Kingdoms, there were the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, which were not without talents similar to those of the Three Kingdoms. After the Three Kingdoms, there were the Six Dynasties and Five Dynasties, which were also not without talents similar to those of the Three Kingdoms. However, without a historical novel like Romance of the Three Kingdoms, their talents were alienated from the minds and eyes of the general populace, and the influence of their names and deeds on customs and society was limited. The effect of historical novels is great! Romance of the Three Kingdoms, based on historical materials and incorporating anecdotes, is a masterpiece crafted with originality."</p>
<p>After Dr. Jiang said this, he added that my compilation of the complete work, encompassing all aspects, not only benefits Records of the Three Kingdoms and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but also serves as a good friend for those who read Records of the Three Kingdoms and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. How unfortunate it is that talents were born in the Three Kingdoms, where they were undermined and excluded, unable to fully realize their strengths! How fortunate it is that talents were born in the Three Kingdoms, where they were recorded by famous historians and depicted by famous novelists, so that they still possess a vivid spirit after thousands of years! My work further expands their legacy and can be attached to Chen Shou and Luo Guanzhong and become immortal. He used words of encouragement that I dared not accept.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Abruptly Revealing Wealth Before a Young Lady to Entice Her, Coveting Her Through Gaps in the Wall, Worrying About Her Chastity</p>
<p>Zhang Jiefu also joined in, saying, "That's right! Master Jia has plenty of money, he doesn't care about this little bit. You can take it." This was truly beyond the dreams of Zhu Hu's wife, who immediately bent over and gave him two bows. Yueying, who had never received such great kindness, unfolded her tightly furrowed brows and smiled at Jia Duocai, saying, "Thank you very much. Poor people can only benefit from gentlemen like you." Jia Duocai never expected that once the money had changed hands, he would be able to make jokes, so he followed behind and walked out of the room, whispering, "See, am I not a very easy-going person? If you spend more time with me, you'll know that I'm the easiest person to talk to." Yueying looked at him, then lowered her head and smiled slightly, pursing her lower lip and gently biting it with her teeth. Jia Duocai had a particular fondness for seeing women in such a shy state. Yueying's doing this bewitched him somewhat. When Zhu Hu's wife came out, following Yueying, he followed Yueying as well. Zhang Jiefu was just standing there idly. The host had left, and the guests had left, so what was the point of him standing there? Therefore, seeing Jia Duocai following Zhu Hu's wife and daughter, he didn't want to disturb them, so he quietly returned to his room. At this time, only the two stacks of foreign money remained in Jia Duocai's room, guarding the table, and it was relatively quiet. However, in the darkness, there was a person whose emotions were particularly tense. It turned out that the room was partitioned with wooden boards. Although they were fitted together very neatly, there were gaps due to the age of the construction. In that room, lived a woman who was bored and had found a book on counting dominoes, which she was reading under the light. The sound of the conversation on the other side reached her ears, and she was very surprised, feeling that this was clearly a human flesh trade. When it came to making money, who wouldn't want to do something like that? (157)</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Actually, I had long known how a woman later revered as "Leizu" in ancient times taught people the story of raising silkworms, but what the Empress Dowager said was a bit more special. What she said was:</p>
<p>"In ancient times, there was a girl who one day suddenly found a silkworm. She thought it was very interesting, so she caught it and put it in a box, but later forgot about it. After three or four days, she suddenly thought of it again, and hurriedly opened the box to take a look, but the silkworm was gone. She saw only a white oval thing. She didn't have the mind to study it carefully, so she took it out and played with it. Her parents saw it and were also very surprised. Of course, there was no such name as 'cocoon' at that time, but after carefully playing with it, they discovered that there was silk on this thing that could be drawn out, and they thought of the possibility of using silk. They then went out together with the girl to look for more. Because they often found them on mulberry leaves, they determined that mulberry leaves were the food for silkworms. From then on, the business of raising silkworms and reeling silk gradually improved and developed. Today, almost half of the fields in our Chinese territory are planted with mulberry trees. In various villages, there are special temples dedicated to this girl. Silkworm-raising families go to pray every year, hoping that she can bless their silkworms to produce good cocoons. This girl has thus become a famous figure in Chinese history."</p>
<p>I don't know if what the Empress Dowager said is reliable, or if other legends are reliable? However, Leizu is indeed a highly revered inventor in our Chinese history. (268)</p>
<h3>Shoes</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Late at night, when I was taking off my shoes, I suddenly noticed a crack in the side of one of the shoes.</p>
<p>"The shoe is broken!" With a sigh, some thoughts arose in my mind:</p>
<p>When I first went to the shoe store, I chose this pair of shoes from among many. It was a pair that fit just right. The tough leather shone with a bright luster. Wearing them on my feet drew the attention of many people to my feet.</p>
<p>The shoes followed me every day, running east and west. Sometimes their surfaces inevitably got dusty. I would wipe them with a flannel cloth, apply some shoe polish, and brush them. Then they would be brand new again.</p>
<p>But as time went by, when it rained, the shoes also followed my feet on muddy roads. The tough leather was inevitably soaked in mud and water, and the bright luster was inevitably covered by dirt. Although I continued to clean them, they could no longer attract attention like they used to.</p>
<p>Now, not only are the heels of these shoes worn down, but I've also noticed a crack in the edge. They are no longer usable. They will be handed over to the maid and become discarded items in the trash can—</p>
<p>The shoes were destroyed in the process of helping me live my life. They never uttered a word of complaint. But towards these shoes that helped me—these shoes that helped me walk many roads—when I see them leaving me forever, can I not have a little bit of lingering affection?</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Changes in Wedding Attire During the Republican Era</h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>The changes in clothing over our country's five thousand years are countless. Generally, after the establishment of a new dynasty, there must be regulations regarding clothing and decoration, especially for wedding attire, which is highly valued and has a set system. However, the wedding attire of a new dynasty is only officially regulated after a change of regime. Therefore, for hundreds of years, wedding attire did not change as frequently as everyday clothing.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the system for formal attire has been undecided and frequently reformed. As a result, wedding attire has also changed with the times and lacks consistency. Since 1935, the differences in wedding attire have varied from month to year, which is very different from the one-style-per-dynasty system of the past. This is all due to the lack of defined formal attire. In summary, from the first year of the Republic to the present day, the evolution of wedding attire can be roughly divided into the following types, which are briefly described below.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic, because the Qing Dynasty had abdicated not long before, the dress code was undecided. People only knew that the Qing Dynasty's mandarin jacket was not suitable for wedding attire, but there was no fixed formal attire format, and they didn't know what to follow. Thus, wedding attire followed local customs. Generally, the groom wore a long gown and a dark outer jacket, with the color of the gown fabric being light and bright. The bride still wore a red skirt and cape, similar to the Qing Dynasty. This was the earliest wedding attire shortly after the establishment of the Republic.</p>
<p>Later, brides all knew that the cape and red skirt were not in line with the times, but without a formal attire style, they imitated European and American dress, wearing Western-style clothes, with pink as the preferred color, and a beaded veil. The length did not reach the ground. The groom still wore a long gown and a dark outer jacket with a melon-rind cap. This was the most popular attire in 1913 and 1914. After this era, brides switched back to ordinary-style dresses, in pink or bright red, wearing a beaded crown. The groom favored a small and fashionable look, with narrow-sleeved and small-front gowns and jackets, which were popular for weddings. This lasted for about two to three years.</p>
<p>Around 1919 and 1920, the bride's attire began to have a formal style, which was a short, mandarin-collar jacket embroidered with a coiled dragon or crane pattern, extending to the knees. Red was used for weddings, and other colors, such as Tianjin blue, were used at other times. A red skirt, also embroidered with floral branches, was worn underneath. Pink or bright red was used for weddings, while bright red was used at other times. A beaded crown was worn on the head, with pendants covering the face, and a beaded veil was draped over it. Flowers were held during the wedding. The groom's attire included both long gowns and dark outer jackets with melon-rind caps, and Western-style formal wear. The Western-style was worn with a tall top hat. All weddings generally followed one of these styles.</p>
<p>Up to today, the cheongsam has been designated as women's formal attire, and wedding attire is primarily based on the cheongsam. However, there are variations with short or long sleeves, and specially made ones. The color is mostly pink, and the beaded veil drags on the ground for several feet. The groom's formal attire is a blue gown and dark outer jacket with a melon-rind cap. However, due to the popularity of Western suits in recent years, Western-style formal wear is often used as wedding attire, and the blue gown and dark outer jacket mandated by the government are rarely seen. This is all due to the times and customs.</p>

<h3>Siam: After the Suppression of Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>Luo Wanli Recently Reported the Truth; Overseas Chinese Federation Asks the Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th) The Siamese government, due to the suppression of overseas Chinese schools, caused dissatisfaction among overseas Chinese. Recently, the Siamese Minister of Education, Bachasarasai, intended to find another solution and invited Lin Tianduo, the principal of Jiao Guang Middle School in Shantou, to contribute his opinions. Lin sent a letter to Bachasarasai at the end of last month, detailing the improvement methods.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) Luo Wanli recently returned to Nanjing from Siam. When reporters inquired about the truth of Siam's suppression of overseas Chinese education, he said that since the success of the revolution in Siam in 1931, the People's Party came to power and promulgated education regulations, which have been implemented for three years. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, arbitrarily banning overseas Chinese schools, or closing and taking back the school agency rights of overseas Chinese schools, and saying that if there is resistance, they will use guns and knives to solve it, even at the cost of lives. As for the rescue methods, it depends on the efforts of the government and the overseas Chinese in Siam. The issue of overseas Chinese education itself should adopt what policy, and it is urgent to discuss it.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Joint Research Association felt that the overseas Chinese education in Siam has been repeatedly suppressed and telegraphed the government yesterday as follows: To Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, and Chen Jun, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam number more than one million. In recent years, they have suffered greatly due to the extreme oppression of the local government. In addition to restricting the entry of Chinese people and strictly enforcing compulsory education regulations, they have recently issued an order to suspend Chinese people within a limited time. Schools and cultural institutions established in Siam, and the government is ignoring our country. If the government does not seriously negotiate and allow it to be trampled on, the future of overseas Chinese education will be unimaginable. It is a matter of national security and the safety of the nation. We earnestly request that you quickly ask the government to seriously negotiate to demand the improvement of overseas Chinese education and promote Sino-Siamese relations in order to appease the feelings of overseas Chinese and benefit the people. The Overseas Chinese Joint Research Association bowed humbly.</p>
<h3>International Competition for Sports Films</h3>
<p>Held in Berlin on September 10th</p>
<p>The Chinese Educational Film Association recently received a letter from the Rome International Educational Film Association, stating that at the International Educational Film Conference held in Rome last year, a proposal was made to encourage the production and promotion of sports films. The original text stated, "The International Educational Film Conference believes that encouraging the production and promotion of sports films is extremely effective and uses the 11th Summer Olympics in 1936 as a good opportunity. Therefore, it is proposed to create an International Competition for Sports Films to achieve the purpose of awarding and promoting such films. This competition is organized by the International Educational Film Association and will be held in the autumn of 1935. To make this plan effective, the International Conference proposes that the Summer Olympics International Committee award gold medals to the best sports films at the 1936 Olympic Games, following the precedent of the committee's awards for the best works on sports. It is also hoped that the representatives of the countries attending the meeting will promptly notify the representatives of the Summer Olympics Committee in their respective countries so that they can submit it for discussion. The Italian Prime Minister has always been enthusiastic about sports and exercise and is invited to support this proposal so that this case can achieve satisfactory results." After the case was passed by all members, it was sent to the Summer Olympics International Committee and submitted for discussion at the 31st meeting held in Athens. The meeting believed that the International Educational Film Association paid attention to promoting the work of films on sports in the process of developing educational films, which was greatly appreciated and unanimously passed to fully support the cause of the International Educational Film Association. As for the proposed organization of the competition, it was also strongly approved. The International Educational Film Association has been actively preparing for the competition by the association's technical and advisory committee. The regulations for the competition have been formulated with a total of fourteen articles: (1) The first International Competition will be initiated and hosted by the International Educational Film Association and organized by the association's technical and advisory committee based on the decision made at the meeting in Stresa in 1934 to select the best sports films. (2) Film production companies, private filmmakers, and film artists, regardless of nationality, may submit their works to participate in the competition. (3) The films participating in the competition are limited to those filmed from 1932 to the autumn of this year. (4) The subject matter of the film should be limited to various sports, without excluding any kind, such as gymnastics, track and field, swimming, rowing, football, basketball, tennis, baseball, skiing, cross-country running, and others. Films that are not filmed on-site but are falsely produced shall not be allowed to participate. Only the various forms of the sport itself, or some special forms, can be the main component of the film and the actions of the performance. (5) One first, second, and third prize will be awarded according to the order of classification. (6) Each competition shall be composed of an executive committee established by the technical and advisory committee of the International Educational Film Association to judge during the inspection and selection of films. The chairman of the executive committee shall be the representative of the country hosting the Summer Olympics. The president of the International Educational Film Association is an ex officio member. In addition, official representatives of seven countries including Italy, France, England, Germany, Russia, Japan, and the United States are all ex officio members. (7) The affairs of the competition will be handled by the chairman of the executive committee. (8) The honorary committee is composed of members of the executive committee and one representative from each country participating in the competition. Sports and motion figures may also be invited to participate in the honorary committee, but the right to choose candidates is purely in the hands of the executive committee. (9) The judgments of the executive committee shall be decided by a majority vote. In case of a tie, the vote of the president of the International Educational Film Association shall prevail. The results of the judgment shall be final and no changes may be requested. (10) Any country wishing to participate in the competition with its own films must pay a registration fee of 100 lire to the executive committee. The income from this item will be used to purchase medals and certificates for the best films. (11) The permanent secretariat of the competition is located at the International Educational Film Association, Via Lazzaro Spallanzani, Rome. (12) The country and city where the competition will be held shall be designated by the executive committee each time. The first competition was decided to be held in Berlin because the next Summer Olympics will be held in Germany in 1936. The director of the German National Film Bureau is the chairman of the executive committee of the first competition. (13) The judging meeting of the first competition is scheduled for September 10 to 20, 1935. (14) The winning films are still owned by the participating companies or manufacturers. The executive committee and the International Educational Film Association reserve the right to publish the results of the competition in newspapers and recommend the most effective methods for promoting these films in international sports centers to the winning companies and manufacturers.</p>
<p>The International Educational Film Association attaches great importance to this initiative and believes that it is a kind of appropriate ideal with educational and social significance, and uses physical sports as various principles of healthy sportsmanship, so it hopes that the associations of various countries will cooperate with it so that local film groups, production companies, filmmakers, or film artists can actively participate in the competition. After receiving the news, the Chinese Educational Film Association rushed to translate the original text and hoped that those in China who have such sports films would send them for participation as much as possible, but for the ex officio members of the executive committee, they are the seven major powers, and China is not among them, because our country's domestic film industry is not strong, and the promotion of educational films has only been around for three years, and there are very few products, which have not been promoted abroad, so in the future, we hope to work hard to make films and strive for international status.</p>

<h3>Lianhua Factory Creates Three-Wheel Swimsuits</h3>
<p>Swimming is a good way to stay healthy and a good way to pass the time in the summer. In recent years, swimming has become popular in our country in the summer. As a result, the number of swimming pools open during the season has been increasing year by year. The number of foreign-made swimsuits sold each year is very large. However, since the introduction of the three-wheel swimsuit, improvements have been made in the actual comfort of clothing during exercise and the propulsion of water resistance during swimming, reducing the waste of energy. The factory has conducted thorough research, so the number of athletes and swimmers who purchase and use them each year has been increasing, recovering a lot of profits. It is reported that the factory's latest 1935-style swimming suit has been created, including one style for men, one style for women, and one style for children. The wool body is made of chemically processed raw materials, so the problems of hygiene, water resistance, color fastness, and durability are all very practical.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Market Weakens and Then Becomes Firm Again</h3>
<p>April Forward Contracts: Central Bank Willing to Settle at Parity Early, Leading to a More Bullish Spread, Resulting in a Rise of Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was stimulated by news that the Central Bank urgently needed to ship spot goods for export and was willing to settle its previously purchased April futures contracts at parity half a month early, sparking buying interest. The market was weak and then became firm again, ultimately rising instead. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets rose, with London up six pence and New York up half a cent. Forward silver prices also rose. However, after large deals were made at the closing, prices remained firm because the United States was buying at a premium of 0.0625. Exchange rates fluctuated. London spot gold rose six pence. A Reuters dispatch from Guangdong stated that the provincial committee's proposal for the government to manage exchange rates and revise the ban on silver exports had little impact. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, retreated to 67 yuan, and then further retreated to 63.4 yuan. The Central Bank posted exchange rates, with both British and American rates unchanged. Customs gold units rose six yuan. The standard gold price was 918.5 yuan. Short covering was quite active and the market was slightly stable. After the opening, Chinese merchants rushed to sell, and the domestic exchange market hardened. Large players were eager to unload, and prices fell after rising. However, there was still short covering after the fall, and banks also bought on the cheap. But as HSBC also posted higher rates, the market hesitated and was uncertain. Although sentiment was weak, there were many buyers who were willing to buy on the cheap, so the Central Bank and HSBC continued to raise foreign exchange rates, making it easy to pull them up. After entering the market, transactions gradually became more ordinary, and the overall trend became hesitant. Although banks had buying appetite, the domestic market was always ordinary, so the rise lacked momentum. The morning close was slightly weak. In the afternoon, the spread market was tentatively conducted, with the bullish side still posting 1-2 yuan. The market was still weak in the upper market, but the 60 yuan mark was always difficult to approach. After the opening, large players came to cover shorts, and banks also tried hard to buy in, and the market rose. Indian silver initially reported a rise of four annas, and then went into a sideways trend, but was soon pulled up again. At this time, there were very few transactions, and the Indian silver returned to one anna. The market state was mediocre. Later, the Central Bank, due to the need to ship a large amount of cash for export today, was willing to immediately accept previously purchased April futures contracts half a month early, initially with spot firms paying half a yuan, and then even being willing to accept them at parity. With the April rollover approaching, this greatly stimulated the buying side's psychology, and the market presented an image of demand exceeding supply, with prices rising sharply, breaking through the 70 yuan mark. Finally, prices settled slightly after some selling at the high, but the market was slightly weak after the close. The overall market situation for the day was very ordinary, and transactions were also ordinary. At 3:00 PM today, the April rollover trade will officially begin. After this round of bullish stimulation, it seems that a flat rollover is possible. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 864.5 yuan, down 5 yuan from the previous close. Yuan Yi and others rose to 5.7 yuan, but Heng Yu, Yong Li, Hui Xiang, Fu Xing, Yong Fu, Changda, Dafa, Yong Yu, Qingyong all sold. Although San Bing bought May U.S. dollars at 2.25, it was difficult to sell at this point, falling to 0.04 yuan. Yong Li, Hui Xiang, Fu An, Rui Xing, and others bought on the cheap to 3 yuan. Heng Yu, Dalian Gang, Tongtai Chang, Fuyu and others sold again at 1 yuan. Zhengjin bought May U.S. dollars at 3.75. Yufeng, Yongyong, Lichang, Dayifeng Yong and others advanced to 3.5 yuan. The preview showed that HSBC posted a rise of 1.25 for British and 2.5 for American currencies. Yingxiang and Dafa Yongyong Lili Hengyu sold one after another, retreating to 60.02 yuan. There was no way to maintain as there were quite a few buyers who bought on the cheap. HSBC and the Central Bank both bought June shillings at 3.125. Tongtai, Changhan, Hengyi, Fengyong, Yicheng, Dada, Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong took advantage of the cheap to reach 5 yuan. Yong Li, Dadecheng, Yuanmao sold at high prices, falling back to 3.3 yuan. Dafa Yong Yingxiang advanced to 5.5 yuan again. Although banks had buying commitments, the domestic market was always ordinary. Yong Li, Heng Yu, Yuanmao, Jiatai, Richang sold, retreating to 1.8 yuan. Dafa Yong and Heng Yu advanced to 4.3 yuan. At this time, Heng Yu and Dafa Yong advanced and retreated alternately, hovering around 4 yuan. When Fuxing Yong took advantage of the cheap to advance to 5.2 yuan, Yong Li, Yuanmao Yong, Dada Dafa Yong Wanfeng and others successively sold down to 1.2 yuan. Shunli and Hanheng maintained on the cheap. The noon close was 862.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 860.7 yuan. Qianchang Xiang, Yuanyi, and Hongxing immediately advanced from 0.02 yuan to 2.4 yuan. Banks actively bought June shillings at 3.75. Indian silver reported 4.4.4 annas. Heng Yu advanced and retreated again, and Dakang, Dacheng, Yuanmao Yong came to sell, falling back to 0.05 yuan. Dafa Yong, Heng Yu, Yuanyi Yong Li Dadecheng still entered on the cheap, gradually rising to 4.1 yuan. Dadecheng Heng Yu and long positions sold, falling to 2.2 yuan. Fuyu accepted the order on the cheap. Indian silver returned to 1.1.1 annas for the second time, rising to more than 3 yuan. After that, news came that the Central Bank urgently needed to ship cash for export, and that the April orders could be released today. The spread has become flat, and people's hearts are greatly encouraged. Da Hengyu, Tongyu Run, Dadecheng, Yong Li Wu, Chang Xiang, Yuanmao, Chun Yuan, Yong Chang Da all advanced, gradually rising back to 71 yuan. Hengxing Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong sold at high prices, falling to 69.1 yuan. Heng Yu Yong Li still accepted. The closing price was 870 yuan. After the closing, although Yuanmao and others advanced, they fell back after Yong Li Yicheng Heng Yu all sold. The final price was about 68 yuan. The highest price for the day was 871 yuan, and the lowest price was 860.2 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 10.8 yuan. As a result, the price was half a yuan better than the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was 918.5 yuan for the Central Bank's standard gold price, about 48 yuan above the closing price, more than 2 yuan higher than the previous close. The April premium was 862 yuan, and the after-market price was 870 yuan. The make-up water was 854 yuan in the morning and 862 yuan in the afternoon. Raw gold was about 5 yuan higher, at 869.5 yuan. There was still a lack of spot transactions. Tianjin goods were about 10 yuan higher, lacking supply, and sellers needed to add 13 yuan. The April rollover will officially begin this afternoon. There were small numbers of transactions in pre-market trading yesterday, with the bullish side posting 1-2 yuan, but the Central Bank will ship a large amount of cash for export today, so the April futures purchased a few days ago are willing to accept in advance. At first, the bullish side had to pay 0.5 yuan, but in the end, it was willing to accept it at par. If the bullish side does not need to pay the spread but can receive the cash half a month early, the impact on this rollover is not small, and the atmosphere of long positions rolling over has the hope of being realized.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was very ordinary. In total, Yifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Jiatai, Wu Changxiang, Qianchangxiang, Hongxing, Yuanyi, Yongli, Yongfeng, Hongkang, Yongyi, Yuren, Fayong, Hanheng and others were on the buying side, while Qingfayong, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Wanfeng, Tongfeng, Hengyu, Qingyong, Shenkang, Hengchangyong, Yuanmaoyong, Tongtaichang, Dachangxiang, Hengxing, Shunli and others were on the selling side. Wanxing Yifeng Yong Yicheng advanced and retreated first, Qingfayong Hengyu Huixiang advanced and retreated first, Dalian Gang Wanxing jointly traded more than 800 lots, netting more than 100 lots, and Shunli jointly traded more than 600 lots, netting more than 100 lots. Qing Gang Hengxing advanced a small number, but retreated more than 100 lots. Shengda advanced and retreated little. The total number of transactions on the day was 29,974 lots in the morning market and 16,737 lots in the afternoon market. The total number of April chips was 18,144 lots, with a total of 46 long positions and 55 short positions.</p>
<h3>Supply and Demand Imbalance: Exchange Rates Ultimately Harden</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches from London, large amounts rose 125, far amounts rose 1875. It was said that after the market closed, the United States offered to buy at the listed price plus 0.0625. The price of silver in New York remained unchanged. The price of forward silver in Montreal remained unchanged or rose by varying amounts up to half a point. The price of gold in London rose by six pence. The British pound appreciated by half a point against the US dollar. The US dollar depreciated by 0.125 against the British pound. The US dollar appreciated by 20 points against the French franc. The US dollar depreciated by 1.5 points against the French franc. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for British currency at 1 shilling, 7 and 3/8 pence, and the US dollar at 38.3125 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, both British and US currencies remained unchanged. Reuters reported that the Guangdong Provincial Assembly proposed that the government manage foreign exchange and amend the Silver Prohibition Ordinance, which had little impact. Chinese merchants' sentiment was weak. The Central Bank's listed rates were announced, with both British and US currencies unchanged. The gold unit of customs duties rose by six li. However, it hardened immediately after opening. Although banks made efforts to support the market, it was inevitably a case of supply exceeding demand. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed rates were announced, with the British pound rising by 0.125 and the US dollar rising by 0.25. The process was still loose. Later, the Central Bank, HSBC, and Mercantile Bank and others took advantage of the low prices to maintain support, but it is still difficult to be optimistic about the overall trend. This is because the Dalian clique's dumping of Dalian had a significant impact on the banks' appetite. In the afternoon market, banks scrambled to cover their positions at low prices, and although it was loose, it could still be maintained. Although the price of silver rose, the overall trend was still stable. Afterwards, general rumors boosted buying interest. Although Chinese merchants' sentiment was lively, the exchange market was not particularly affected. At the close, the near-term selling price for British currency was 1 shilling and 7.5 pence, and the US dollar was 38.5 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was down 0.125, and the US dollar was up 0.1875. Chinese merchants covered approximately 100,000+ pounds and 200,000+ US dollars, and HSBC settled accounts. In addition, the Central Bank and the International Savings Society and others covered pounds. Today will record the trading after one day.</p>

<h3>Stable and Quiet Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>Limited Fluctuations... Increasing Scarcity of Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's government bond market continued its winding course, with a slightly firmer tone. Transactions were increasingly quiet. Most plates listed the exchange price, and for each plate or type, most had only the listed price, many of these had no transactions, and the market was lifeless, with most people waiting and watching. Muted environmental news led to winding course, and the trend is not easy to foresee for the time being. Yesterday's performance was best in the first morning market session, with scattered demand still enthusiastic. Although they could not be completely consistent, most showed a slight increase. Consolidated Salt Tax was up 4 jiao and Twenty-Three Customs was up 4 and a half jiao, the most favorable. The second session was slightly chaotic. Demobilization Bonds saw a rebound of 2.5 jiao due to the smaller size of the first session. The rest fluctuated greatly, meandering around 1 jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, most rose more than they fell, and the meandering range narrowed. Closing transactions were even quieter, and fluctuations were even more stagnant, only up and down by 5 fen to 1 jiao.

The total transaction volume for futures was 7,225,000 yuan, and no spot transactions were opened.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Develop; Marked Yarn Rebounds</h3>
<p>After the decline in the yarn market, it has rebounded again. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market continues to develop, with the Henan group making the most active purchases, leading to a bullish sentiment. As for the marked yarn for this month, competition between the bulls and bears is fierce. Mou Kee's short positions and Yu Da's long positions are both holding steady, making future changes difficult to predict.</p>
<p>A Sudden Surge in Buying in the Afternoon Market for Gold Chicken</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened with each month showing stagnation, as both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Near and far months were down by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. Later, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were still good, resulting in a gain of 2 and 6 jiao for the near months and 3 jiao for the far months. The opening of the afternoon market was still calm. When the second plate was shot, the wind turned purple, because the province of Henan had continued to crave for 16-count yarn, and the buying atmosphere suddenly thickened. However, according to the market, the delivery of 10-count coarse yarn was ample. As a result, each month of marked yarn rose again by 3, 5, 6, and 8 jiao. It was found that 1,600 bales were sold by Chang Feng, with 400 bales remaining; 500 bales were sold by Yi Da; 600 bales were sold by Ren Feng; 400 bales were sold by Tai Chang; 400 bales were sold by Xin Cheng; and 350 bales were sold by Jun Chang. 1,950 bales were bought by Da Fu; 900 bales were bought by Jin Chang; 550 bales were bought by Yong Da; 400 bales were bought by Da Feng; 800 bales were bought by He Xing; and 300 bales were bought by Run Kang.

<h3>Marked Cotton Recovers Due to US Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the market picture shows a trend of reactionary rebound, with US cotton rebounding by over 20 pounds of sound. Bullish sentiment is tight, but exchange rates are lengthening and the gold market is declining. According to foreign merchants' perspective, the future of US cotton is still difficult to determine, and spot cotton consumption is not strong. Indian cotton, Pinggu Ershen, has newly imported 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>Zheng Label Rebounds by 3 Angles</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened with a stable market picture, as US cotton rebounded by more than 20 pounds of sound after its decline, and Indian cotton fell by 1 rupee and 25. There were slightly fewer contestants in the arena, and the market plate reappeared nervous. However, the price of gold fell, and the exchange rate was afraid, and the market saw a slight compression. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The situation became firmer at the opening of the afternoon session, with the yarn market rebounding.

<h3>US Cotton Rebounded Yesterday</h3>
<p>There is a Saying That Cotton Stored Below Angle Fen is Determined Not To Be Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was bought by Liverpool because of good news, and the industry's spot traders and foreign merchants bought it together, so it jumped up 13 to 19 points when it opened. Afterwards, it continued to be firm and bullish. It is said that cotton stored below one jiao and two fen in May is determined not to be sold. At the same time, cotton farmers would rather borrow one jiao and two fen of loan than to be unwilling to sell at this time, so the difference between futures and southern spot is even greater. Roosevelt's statement is also enough to attract buyers, but the market situation is still unstable. In the afternoon, it was slightly weak due to local gang and New Orleans selling, and finally recovered again due to spot traders buying near months and fewer sellers, and the closing was firm. It is estimated that spot rose by 20 points, and futures rose by 11 to 31 points. British spot cotton fell by 2 points, and futures rose by 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton rose at first due to market merchants buying, and then softened due to Japanese and European exporters selling. It is estimated that Pinggu Er fell by 1 rupee, Oulam fell by 2 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (13th telegram).</p>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Foreign Merchants Have A Slight Stomach</h3>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The Xihe Flower Market is calm and the sales are not very smooth, but Western merchants have a slight stomach, and the market for good goods is trending firm. Fuka Yoko bought 200 bales, opening at 35 yuan and 5 jiao. Other foreign merchants transacted 70 bales at a price of 35 yuan and 1 jiao. Also, the American species flower is calm. After the factory had previously continued to absorb, it has been full recently, and business has become more stagnant. However, the Shen gang is still willing to sell merchants, and intends to trade 190 packages, opening at 41 yuan. The Donghe Long-staple Cotton Factory has a slight motivation, and the market atmosphere has not changed. The Beiyang Factory imported 50 packages at a price of 42 yuan and 54 packages, opening at 43 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Wheat Flour Hovers, Wheat Bran Sales Are Level</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the various months showed a tendency to fall first and then stabilize. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded one or two jiao, and Canada rebounded 4 fen. When the price opened, the current flour for this month was still tightly squeezed, but the foreign wheat continued to arrive at various factories. After this production, it can be increased. Therefore, people's hearts softened, and the bulls returned out of the powder. At the time of closing, the lowest returned to two and a half fen. The various far months also did not have many buyers and the guests did not move, so they were also one fen less. At the opening of the afternoon market, this month was still flat, and then the current flour was still tight, and the goods that had been purchased could not be released, so people's hearts were good again, and the initial price rebounded by two fen. The various far months are also stepping up because the recent period is good and the factory has no outgoing files. As a result, this month rebounded by 7.5%, April rose by half a point, May fell by half a point, June fell by two and a half points, July fell by seven and a half points, and August fell by (unspecified) points.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the various months showed a tired and stagnant image. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded one or two jiao, and Canada rebounded 4 fen. When the price opened, although foreign wheat saw a slight improvement, the factory stomach was silent in the near future due to the continued arrival of foreign wheat, and people's hearts were tired and stagnant. In the long term, the weather is good, and wheat seedlings are growing exceptionally well everywhere, so people's hearts are also weak. Various months compared to the previous day, this month fell by 3 fen, July fell by 2 fen, and August fell by 4 fen. At the opening of the afternoon market, the transactions in various months were extremely deserted. Only April opened with a price drop of 3 fen, and the rest were empty shots. Observing the situation, I am afraid that there is still time for the excitement. In the current wheat market, the factory stomach is silent, and there will be trading after it is loosened.</p>
<p>The bran market, due to the recent decline in sales, the foreign houses are not active, and the foreign wheat continues to arrive at various factories, and future production can be subsidized, so people's hearts are slightly flat, ordinary bran is 2 yuan 5 jiao and 8 fen, and Du wheat bran is 2 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Prices Will Not Rise For A While</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of He rice in Nanshi was slightly more than before, with a total of 27 or 8 (goods with a total of more than 5,000 dan), but the sales market was ordinary. Yantai, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao and other gangs only bought 7 or 8 hundred packages, so the market color turned tired. The prices of each thick japonica and thin indica rice were reduced by 5 fen. Du (unspecified), Jian and Yin Bianyuan (etc.), all lacked goods and had no market. The source of He Xia of the various roads north of Shanghai was 16 or 7 ships, and the way out for the various goods on the market was plain. The market price of white japonica was high, and the price of medium and secondary rice was close to the angle. The price of thin indica was high, and the road in the middle and secondary roads was tight. Bai Yuan was tired for several minutes, and the rest of the goods were also flat.</p>
<p>Although foreign rice has not risen, the market has been active. The inland and Nanjing have continued to be loaded. This street also moved to run high-grade rice and small twisted rice. In addition to accepting direct distribution from the industry, the Jiangxi gang also gradually transported away the previously completed goods. Yesterday, more than 2,000 packages of No. 3 Saigon and small twisted rice were bought on the market.</p>
<p>The customers of the inland have revitalized again, and they have bought more than 1,000 packages of Xiang machine brown rice and (unspecified) Jing rice. This street and the Jiangxi gang also have questions about the machine Yuan rice. Although the market is affected by foreign countries, it is still expected to be available due to lack of storage and depletion.</p>
<p>The market conditions for miscellaneous grains are all tired and weak, and only those who are in urgent need have transactions. The source is still continuously and continuously, so the supply exceeds demand and it is difficult to hawk and sell. Yesterday, the market only opened more than 1,500 packages of Hankou Zhadou, the price ranged from 3 yuan and 4 jiao to 2 jiao and 3. They were sold by this street and inland, in addition, the insiders have transactions with customers. The price of Yingzhou beans and cars is 3 yuan and 5 jiao and a half.</p>

According to yesterday's letter, a batch has been shipped from Zhangzhou and will arrive in Shanghai soon. If the goods are bright in color and the cake base is soft and cooked, it will be able to sell well. However, it is found that the remaining stocks here are all ordinary goods.

<h3>From Chivalric Romances to Don Quixote</h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>As a pioneer in expressing the themes of chivalric romances, there was the medieval chivalric poetry, including various forms of knightly lyrical poems. The feudal aristocracy, who were the rulers of the Middle Ages, reflected their spirit in the literature of that era. Consequently, chivalric poems, songs of military achievements and martial valor, and lyrical poems reflecting the knightly spirit of courtly love became a major trend in medieval European literature. The protagonists of these works were often nothing more than loyal servants of the country and religion, feeling that they "should endure hardship, cold, and deprivation for the sake of their monarch, without sparing their own flesh and blood," feeling that "food and sweet sleep cannot comfort their hearts like the call to advance to the battlefield," "using special political poems to protect the monarch's rights and threaten or ridicule his enemies," and using love poems to praise the feudal lord's wife, praising her beauty and noble virtues, and expressing the feelings of loyal subjects and knights.</p>
<p>By the 13th century, the feudal structure based on natural economy was gradually eroded and declined by the emerging economy—commercial capitalism. Consequently, the narrative poems (songs) and lyrical poems (love poems), which were the main content of literature during the flourishing period of feudalism, were gradually replaced by prose novels permeated with a strong urban atmosphere. By the 14th century, when bourgeois culture was established in Italy, the medieval poetic forms and styles, the abundant and clear poems that supported and admired the feudal system, and the elements full of asceticism, religious sentiment, miraculous fantasy, and idealistic symbolism, which were artistic expressions of the ideology of the gradually declining knightly and aristocratic classes, such as Dante's poems, had to be replaced by Boccaccio's realistic works, the prose novel "Decameron."</p>
<p>However, with the development of commercial capitalism, the demands of monarchical power arose, and chivalric poetry was revived in Italy. At this time (the 15th century), the new chivalric poems of Italy "arose from the combination of two elements—on one hand, the aristocratic bourgeoisie's taste for chivalric themes, and on the other hand, the lack of artistic completion and the folk ballads full of fairytale-like absurdity and incoherence. These poems idealized knights and their military and amorous adventures, while also incorporating the clumsy techniques and disjointed themes of vulgar folk chivalric poetry." However, what we must pay attention to here is the "parody" of chivalric poetry techniques that occurred simultaneously with this phenomenon. The poem "Morgante" by Pulci, a writer living in Florence, gave a kind of bitter satire and ridicule in the form of "parody" to the feudal system and the revival of chivalric poetry arising from the aristocraticization of the commercial capitalist class. This satirical attitude developed into a unique and complete form in Folengo's poem "Baldus." And the novel by the 16th-century French humanist writer Rabelais, with a solemn and exaggerated approach, a kind of humorous rewriting of chivalric novels popular among commoners and nobles, gave a fierce satire of the feudal knightly system.</p>
<p>The one who achieved the greatest success by utilizing this humorous rewriting of chivalric novels—the technique of "parody"—was Cervantes of 17th-century Spain.</p>
<p>After the 17th century, the Spanish aristocratic class also collapsed due to the rise of the new urban class and its culture. This phenomenon, expressed in literature, on one hand, dealt a fatal blow to the gradually dying knightly class, its culture, and poetry; and on the other hand, "surrounded the knightly posture, which had become a 'shadow of the past,' with a final halo." "Therefore, it is not surprising that the Spanish chivalric novels of this era used the technique of 'parody' to caricature the knightly posture."</p>
<p>Thus, the ugly, old, biased, and skinny "Don Quixote" put on his worn armor, rode his pitiful nag Rocinante, regarded a fat farm girl Dulcinea as a noble lady, and took his squire Sancho Panza, going to do his earth-shattering great deeds.</p>
<p>Although our author used the technique of "parody" to depict the pitiful image of the knight, and permeated it with affectionate ridicule; however, just like Gogol's depiction of the protagonist Akakiy Akakievich in "The Overcoat," his laughter is not cold, but rather melancholy. In the depths of that ridicule, we can taste a kind of almost loving flavor. After making people laugh, he took away a heavy heart, a true melancholy. Cervantes "on one hand, buried the world of knights and knightly literature with ridicule (since 'Mr. Quixote' appeared, Spain has no longer had chivalric novels.) At the same time he was surrounding the head of his own 'knight of the sorrowful countenance' with the shining halo of poetry," this duality expressed in "Mr. Quixote" is also a reflection of Cervantes' ideology as a member of the Spanish petty bourgeoisie who was disintegrating with the decline of the feudal system and the arrival of urban capitalist culture: he clearly understood the collapse and death of the knightly system, thus clearly depicting this "shadow of the past," but also permeated his pen with a lingering emotion, a fallen person's sentimentality for the past; he depicted Quixote as a clownish figure that makes people laugh, while also depicting him as an idealist, a person who is dissatisfied with the existing society (in Lunacharsky's "The Liberated Don Quixote," this quality, which is rich in modern significance, is particularly emphasized.) His ridicule of Quixote, this pitiful knight, can be said to be ridicule dissolved in love, a kind of "laughter with tears."</p>
<p>In the analysis of Quixote's squire Sancho Panza, Friche also similarly emphasizes his duality. Although Sancho Panza seems to be written as a deceitful and cunning character, in reality, this is precisely a typical representation of the materialism of the peasants, which is opposed to the idealism of the aristocrats. In Lunacharsky's "The Liberated Don Quixote," this contrast becomes even more powerful and obvious.</p>
<p>As Friche said: "The commoners have replaced the aristocrats!"</p>
<h3>Smoke</h3>
<p>— Chi Xia</p>
<p>Lately, my mood often easily slips into boredom. Casually picking up a cigarette to smoke, I feel that my life is as fleeting as that smoke.</p>
<p>"Smoke! Smoke! Everything is a layer of smoke!" Those who have read Turgenev's "Smoke" must remember these words spoken by the protagonist Litvinov!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was born and grew up in this hopeless environment. If I didn't have a soul, I could have lived through this era comfortably. However, for those who are slightly sensitive, it's not the same. Nothing can be done, everything can make you feel troubled, everything is like smoke and mist, fleeting like smoke!</p>
<p>Reality is too ugly, which makes those who should have ideals feel as disappointed as smoke. Just like the protagonist Litvinov in the novel "Smoke," although he grew up in a bad environment at first, he still held a glimmer of hope in his heart. However, since he returned home, his father died, and in the old aristocratic mansion, he was left alone. His mood fell into depression, without hope, without passion, and without money. He began land reclamation work. Everyone knows that land reclamation is an impossible dream. His final efforts were shattered, and he fell into nothingness. A year passed, then another year. The third year began, and the great ideal gradually turned into the ugliness of reality. Whether bright or dark, it now bears a gray face that cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>How much does this resemble our current state! It is a living portrayal. Smoke, everything can be represented by smoke! At first, it is very thick, gradually fading, like playing a ridiculous game, gradually lengthening, gradually disappearing. The original mist is lost, the fake mask changes into the true original form, using the mist of smoke to deceive people, to deceive oneself, but this deception is not long-lasting. The result of deception will make you fall into pain, a kind of despairing sorrow, mixed with a false and empty situation.</p>
<p>When smoking, it is easy to have such thoughts. Not smoking? It's also impossible, because in this era, only smoke can comfort oneself and be used to kill painful time!</p>
<h3>Dragon Lanterns and Horse Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, once the fifth day of the Lunar New Year had passed, I would look forward to the Lantern Festival, always happily singing:</p>
<p>"The fifteenth of the first month, dragon lanterns and horse lanterns come to see."</p>
<p>When I was a child, I didn't understand anything, I only knew about the excitement. At that time, when dragon lanterns or horse lanterns came, people would set off firecrackers to welcome them. Wealthy families would also join in the fun and set off many flower tubes, moon cannons, nine dragons, and so on.</p>
<p>At that time, the wallets of the people in the countryside seemed to be more full than they are now. They had spare money to play with these many things. The government also seemed to be accommodating the people's feelings and not interfering in their leisure activities. Therefore, the strong and healthy young farmers, on the last days of their only rest and entertainment of the year, would have as much fun as possible.</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums grew closer. Then the children of each family would sneak out of the house and rush to where the sound was coming from. Children are always enthusiastic supporters of games. Then the men would come out, followed by the women, and the elderly.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, dragon lanterns and horse lanterns are actually very monotonous and very tasteless. The gongs and drums always play the same tune. The marching style of the horse lanterns is always the scissors-like movement. The dragon lanterns are also just turning east and west, the dragon's head passing under the dragon's feet, or making a rolling posture on the ground. The movements are really as simple as can be! And so simple as to make people disgusted! But the people in the countryside were crazy! The people in the town were also crazy! Young and old all ran out to watch and admire like crazy! Why? In a word, they lacked entertainment too much on weekdays! Like a person who is starving, as long as they have something to eat, they no longer have any choice about the food!</p>
<p>Moreover, they knew that there was never anything better than this!</p>
<p>Dropping dragon lanterns and horse lanterns is not only for one's own entertainment and to entertain others. They also have other purposes.</p>
<p>Those who play these many things are mostly young farmers. They have the physical strength of oxen. Sometimes they may be exhausted by excessively busy work. But to teach them to do nothing at all for more than ten days, just to rest, they can't get used to it. They can't get used to a lazy life. They like labor. Let those elderly fathers and elders smoke yellow tobacco, play cards, and hold teapots to chat idly. They like to do strenuous, sweaty work. That kind of work is fun!</p>
<p>Dropping these lanterns not only requires strength, but also requires courage. This is a risky move that everyone in the countryside knows. If the lanterns from one village are dropped into another village, the men from the other village can have sufficient reasons, or rather, no reason at all, to provoke them, fight, and tear the lanterns apart! So if you want to play this kind of provocative game, it's not enough to know some martial arts, you also have to have the courage to hit people or be hit, because it's not uncommon for the result to be serious injury or death.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will ask: Why fight? The reason is very simple. It's that everyone admits that those who play these kinds of lanterns are all heroes in the eyes of the villagers, and at the same time, no one admires who is more heroic than whom.</p>
<p>Playing dragon lanterns and horse lanterns, in addition to venting that excess energy, also contains an element of venting sexual desire. Especially the horse lanterns. In the horse lanterns, there is one dressed as a "slutty horse" and one dressed as a "matchmaker." This horse always follows her, making many bold expressions. And she deliberately makes many coy and laughable gestures. Attracting the men to laugh loudly, and the women to scold softly. But everyone likes to watch that kind of action that "civilized people" despise.</p>
<p>There is also a legend about dragon lanterns. It is said that when it is dropped, if a woman who has not been able to conceive for a long time can bare her lower body, cover it with a bamboo cloth skirt, and then grab a handful of grain and quietly sprinkle it on the dragon's head, she will be able to conceive within that year. However, the one who suffers is the person who drops the dragon's head. If he doesn't notice it immediately and lets the woman give him a reward, he will get seriously ill or even die within a year. It seems that dragon lanterns have a great use in helping fertility. (End)</p>
<h3>War Jottings (II)</h3>
<p>— By Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>"Can one 'go' of support grain feed us to survive!"</p>
<p>Upon seeing the small bag of rice sent two or three times a month from the district chief as support grain for the bereaved families of soldiers who had gone to war, the mother always threw it aside in anger, as if she had been deceived by someone. Every day, she carried huge baskets on a shoulder pole to the barracks of the 23rd Regiment to carry leftover food. Every day, she bought the soldiers' leftovers, or the rice burnt at the bottom of the pot, and the leftover soup, etc., by bidding for a certain amount of money. And, she called the equally poor landladies in the neighborhood and distributed or sold those things to them.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the father went to war, newly cooked rice had hardly been eaten even once; but, in any case, even if it was leftover rice that had been steamed three or four times, we managed to get through the days without feeling hungry.</p>
<p>The second year, I was already seven years old and entered elementary school. At school, whether during games or doing anything, the teachers taught us to sing military songs.</p>
<p>Only costs one 'wen' a month,</p>
<p>Twelve thousand eight hundred tons,</p>
<p>Heard that it's unmatched in the world,</p>
<p>Called Ameuca Boy</p>
<p>I don't remember very clearly; it was probably these kinds of lines. I still remember the tune of the song. From the first grade onwards, we were charged one copper coin each month for the construction of naval warships.</p>
<p>This song was indeed a celebratory song for the construction of a large Japanese warship, unprecedented in the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>That female teacher named Tsuda, protruding her huge, nearly pregnant belly, raised her feet, waved her hands, and used these games and songs to teach us. We formed a circle around the teacher, and during the singing and dancing, the teacher taught us that war was simply extremely noble, and that it was more inferior than being disabled to be born as a human being and not go to war?</p>
<p>In my pure childish heart, I felt that my father fighting outside was a very praiseworthy thing; and, I had a lot of face among my playmates.</p>
<p>One morning, after paying the highest respects to the Emperor's image in the schoolyard, the principal called the students whose fathers were soldiers who had gone to war to the podium to express their feelings. Needless to say, elementary school students would not express such feelings etc. in front of everyone; the head teachers had us memorize the phrases to say the day before. I, a first-grade student, was the second to be called to the podium by the principal.</p>
<p>I was very flustered; I just tried my best to say the phrases that I had memorized by rote in a loud voice.</p>
<p>"My father is a transportation soldier of the 6th Battalion of the Army Transport Corps, Transport Soldier of the Transport Corps, Tokunaga Isokichi, ——"</p>
<p>As soon as I said this, the older children in the upper grades giggled. I was inexplicably confused and felt very embarrassed and couldn't speak. The principal glared at everyone and said:</p>
<p>"No laughing!"</p>

<h3>Dreadful Elementary School Students with Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>This is indeed an extremely serious problem that cannot be ignored! According to the previous tuberculosis test conducted by this city on elementary school students, five schools including Bede, Xicheng, He'an, Danhua, and Songxue participated. The results of the test showed that among the students tested in the five schools, a total of 2,916 students, 2,137 were infected, 739 were not infected, and the reactions of 40 were unknown. Looking at the statistics after the test, the infected reached more than 70 percent. Just testing over 2,000 elementary school students in five schools has yielded such an alarming number. If all the municipal elementary schools in Shanghai were to conduct the test, the number would be even more impressive. So many elementary school students in our country suffer from lung disease. Can we still ignore this problem? Isn't it extremely serious?</p>
<p>Lung disease is a very terrible disease, which can kill one person in a small case, and destroy a nation in a large case. Therefore, all countries in the world pay great attention to this disease. They are doing their best to study the methods of prevention, treatment, and eradication. Their view of lung disease is no different from treating a demon, staying away from it for fear of being too close, and eliminating it for fear of not being far enough. Because once this disease is allowed to spread and spread, the life of the individual and the root of the nation are in danger of falling into an unimaginable desperate situation!</p>
<p>Only we Chinese people have always been indifferent to various aspects of hygiene. And the symptoms of lung disease have become an extremely common phenomenon. If a detailed investigation and examination is made of the number of Chinese people who have contracted lung disease, and statistics are compiled, I am afraid that the number will also surprise people, or even more than 70 percent!</p>
<p>The cause of lung disease can be traced to two sources. One is congenital, inherited from parents who have lung disease. The other is acquired, transmitted by lung disease from those nearby. Chinese people have always been very free about marriage, and have never been interfered with by the government. Therefore, even men and women with lung disease can get married casually. As a result, the children born to Chinese people often have a hereditary predisposition to lung disease. This is why there are so many people with lung disease in our country. As for the fact that Chinese people do not pay attention to hygiene and spit everywhere, this is also one of the reasons for the increase in lung disease.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the prevention of lung disease should be rescued from two aspects. For the symptomatic method, the government should set up more lung disease treatment centers in various places, and persuade the people to pay full attention to hygiene, and prohibit people from spitting everywhere. For the fundamental method, the government should restrict people's marriage. All men and women who want to get married must be examined by a doctor and hold a health certificate before they can marry together. If they have lung disease, they should be strictly prohibited from marrying. This method has been implemented in foreign countries for a long time, and the effect is very significant. Our country should take it as a model as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For the elementary school students who have been examined this time, it is heard that the Bureau of Education has notified the families of students who have been injected and have a lung disease reaction to quickly seek treatment on their own, and re-examine them after a considerable period of time, limiting the admonishment to three times. If they still ignore it, they will be ordered to withdraw from school. On the one hand, the two bureaus of Health and Education, for the future of the health of all the children in the city, decided to set up a children's sanatorium in the municipal hospital which is under construction. This approach is urgent. However, we hope even more that the education and health authorities will conduct another tuberculosis test in all schools in Shanghai in the near future in order to engage in thorough prevention. Furthermore, we ask the government authorities to pay attention to the spread of lung disease, to quickly consider fundamental methods of eradication, and that the harm of lung disease is very fierce. I sincerely hope that the people of our country will pay attention to defense and prevent it from spreading, so as not to become a disaster for the people of our country!</p>
<h3>It Is Better to Return Home</h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>(The cuckoo is also known as the Zi Gui bird, its cries are utterly mournful, as if saying it is better to return home, it is better to return home.)</p>
<p>Time flies by on the calendar, life churns in a whirlpool, listen! It is the season for cuckoo cries again.</p>
<p>What touching melodies of homesickness! Travelers.</p>
<p>My heart is deeply moved; yes, it tells me: it is time to go home.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Ling saying: "Qingming is approaching, wild grasses have grown all over your father's grave, you should come back to sweep and pay respects. Your mother and I miss you so much! And Yi'er, whom you haven't seen for half a year, can now call 'Daddy' at your photo. Come back soon! Come and accept your son's call."</p>
<p>Like the cuckoo's cry, my heart is deeply moved. Yes, I need to go back.</p>
<p>My hometown, which I haven't seen for half a year! Now I am preparing to throw myself back into your embrace.</p>
<p>I remember when I left, it was autumn, you were so melancholic, like Ling's face when saying goodbye, how sad it made people! Now I'm coming back soon, surely you will change your attire to welcome me.</p>
<p>So I close my eyes and think—the fields I haven't seen for half a year are covered with a carpet of oily green, the branches I haven't seen for half a year are draped in verdant coats, the stream I haven't seen for half a year is limpid and softly manipulated by the March spring breeze at will, here you can still see two or three fat white geese comfortably splashing in the water, pairs of swallows lightly skimming over the water to glimpse their own lovely shadows, and patches of clouds leisurely racing across the bottom of the water... Yes, it's not like when I left, it's like Ling's face when she knows I'm coming home: full of youthful smiles.</p>
<p>I am still so familiar with the spring in my hometown, but I wonder if my hometown in the spring still recognizes me? That person is not like before, the childishness of past years, like the fallen leaves in autumn, has been stripped away by the storms of reality, leaving only: a husk-like body and an ash-like soul.</p>
<p>Perhaps my hometown will be unfamiliar with me? But I must come back, it is the first Qingming after my father's death! I must stand before his old tomb and offer my sincere respect, I must tell him about my experiences after our eternal farewell, I must carefully examine the surrounding grasses.</p>
<p>My mother after my father's death is in pain, she has placed all her hope on her son. She cares about her son's safety even more than she cares about her own, and she is extremely unwilling for her son to know about occasional minor illnesses, oh great maternal love! I haven't experienced it for half a year. How much new white hair has been added to her head? How much new wrinkles have been added to her forehead? I must return and lean in her arms like when I was young, tell her that I am doing well outside, tell her not to worry, and then look up and see a kind smile spread across her kind face.</p>
<p>Ling has become much haggard since having a child, and because of the environment, I can't hire a nanny for her. So she has to do everything herself regarding the child, and the pair of hands that have been dyed rough by labor truly make me unable to bear to hold them. For whom? I can only blame myself. I shouldn't let her taste the bitterness of separation again, I must go back.</p>
<p>Sitting face to face with Ling, let Yi'er, who has just learned to walk, stagger from here to there. Suddenly, he cries because he feels unfamiliar, so Ling picks him up and says: "This is Daddy, isn't he just like this picture?" Saying this, she points to the photo hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>A pair of small, dark, and round eyes look at the wall, look at me, and then look at Ling, his mother, he laughs, so innocently.</p>
<p>"Daddy," Ling calls out.</p>
<p>"Daddy," Yi'er imitates.</p>
<p>The people of my hometown are all waving to me] I must go back.</p>
<p>I take a leave form from the manager's office to fill out, and then tidy up the few books I have.</p>
<p>(Cuckoo, don't cry! I am listening to you.)</p>
<h3>Overnight Stay on the River</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The days in winter are very short, and our small boat was still drifting on the wide river, and it was already the time for crows to return to their nests. From morning until now, although I forgot to bring a watch when I set off in a hurry, I had been sitting with my knees bent for so long that my legs had gone from aching to numb. There was a pack of leftover cigarettes in my pocket, and even the lining paper was folded into small boats, which were placed dozens of feet behind me. Feeling a kind of disappointment after fatigue, we yawned in unison and stretched our legs, which were about to detach from ourselves, but the boat suddenly tilted, and the elderly couple almost rushed from the bow into the center of the river.</p>
<p>"Sir, this is not a game!" The old man pulled the pole out of the river bottom, bent over, and faced the door of the boat and said.</p>
<p>"Where will we stay tonight?" This was the question that I was concerned about.</p>
<p>"There's probably a small town ahead, but it's against the wind and against the current, and we can't muster any strength to row there. Those of you sitting in the cabin don't know the hardship of the boatmen. We almost fell into the center of the river just now, and who would fish us out in the dark?" As he spoke, he vigorously poled towards the center of the river.</p>
<p>I poked my head out from the cabin door, and the river stretched windingly forward, as if there would never be a stop. On both banks of the fields, the evening wind stirred, and it was impossible to distinguish between people and grass. A collapsed oxcart shed gradually moved behind us. Focusing my eyes on the farthest distance, I didn't see any trace of the so-called small town. Instead, I received the boatman's complaint, and I felt angry in my heart.</p>
<p>"What's the name of that town?"</p>
<p>"It seems—I've forgotten. Ask a passerby to see."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but curse "Damn it" in my heart. After sitting on the boat for a whole day, I hadn't seen a single person except for seeing a piece of otter skin dog napping under the sun when I first got on the boat. Now he was talking so easily? I was too lazy to argue with him, so I shrank back into the cabin.</p>
<p>In a moment, it was pitch black. They made their home on the water, and they didn't mind tying the boat tightly to the shore and staying overnight in this wilderness. But could you disagree? We couldn't lift the pole, we couldn't row the oars, and besides, it was pitch black in all directions.</p>
<p>The couple climbed to the stern, skillfully carried the cooking utensils to the shore, gathered some wild firewood, and asked us if we wanted to eat their Xian rice. They skillfully started a fire. That fellow Li Ma had been sulking the whole time, but now his stomach probably couldn't hold out any longer, and he threw all the terror to the back of his mind and climbed ashore.</p>
<p>I ate a very comfortable meal. This means that I could stretch my arms and legs at this time of day, and my stomach was empty, so the rice tasted unexpectedly sweet. However, the problem came next: how could this small boat accommodate so many passengers? Although the old couple spread out a tattered quilt and slept on the bow, we still slept with our knees bent as before.</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely tired. The two boatmen who had been working for a whole day naturally fell asleep as soon as their heads hit the pillows. We couldn't close our eyes the whole time. All the terrors were subconsciously fighting in our minds. Hearing the distant barking of dogs, it seemed that misfortune was about to befall us immediately. This was an era of turmoil!</p>
<p>Worrying and guarding, I didn't fall asleep peacefully until the next day when the boat set sail; in reality, I could no longer endure the torture of exhaustion.</p>
<h3>Festival Day</h3>
<p>— Si Lang</p>
<p>"××! Please come out quickly to watch the lion dance!" The landlord's child was shouting loudly. At first, I thought she was teasing me. Where did the lion come from? I pretended not to hear and ignored her, but after a while, the landlord's wife also came to my room to ask: "The lion dance is so good, why don't you watch it?" I then believed that there really was such a thing, but I still didn't understand what the lion dance was all about. Later, after the landlord's wife explained it to me, I learned that this was a scene from a Japanese festival day. It is said that on this festival day, in addition to the lion dancers going to the door of every house to perform a dance, which is considered a blessing; a platform is also set up in the shrine to perform plays. It was really lively! So I went to the shrine with the landlord's child.</p>
<p>It was a good day, a clear sky, with the sun hanging in the sky, the sun shining on the earth, and all living things were flourishing because of it. The little birds on the branches were also rejoicing because of it, singing natural songs. It was truly a season when spring had arrived in the world! The landlord's child and I came out of the house and ran over a small hill, because the shrine was on the other side of the hill. A stone frame that seemed to be made up of two crosses joined together was considered the first gate of the shrine. On top of it were hung some things like mirrors and porcelain used to ward off evil spirits in Chinese temples. Both sides were full of pine and cypress trees, a verdant green. In the middle was a stone staircase, and we rushed up the stairs, passing through several stone frame gates before reaching the square in front of the shrine. In addition to a stage for performing plays, there were also some stalls selling food and toys on the square. Many children were gathered there, and some were dressed in brand-new clothes like the children in Chinese villages when watching the parade of gods. Because the play on the stage had not yet started, we went into the shrine to take a look for a while. All the settings were similar to those in China, but they were smaller and more elegant than ordinary Chinese temples. Especially the flocks of pigeons that hopped around freely there, just like the quiet and poetic atmosphere of a Greek church. The play on the stage began, and we stood there for half a day, and only saw a drummer and a flute player squatting in a corner of the stage playing music. The tune was old and solemn. The setting on the stage was very simple, with two door curtains hanging, a low table placed, a bowl of clear water placed on top, and also two staffs. A person wearing an old man's mask, wearing ancient clothes, and holding a court tablet in his hand, kept kneeling to the four directions, making various dance-like postures according to the old and solemn music. There was no new or interesting play to watch. Ah! This is the so-called "Festival Day" in Japan.</p>

<h3>Peanut Boat</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Whenever I peel a peanut in my hand, I will inevitably think of the story of the peanut boat: especially the old man with the silver beard on a peanut boat, and a little girl with double buns, I still remember them at all times.</p>
<p>All the people on the peanut boats are from Jiangbei. Normally, these boats do not come here. Their profession, in addition to selling peanuts, is usually fishing or ferrying. A small boat is considered a home, and all the living and eating are done here. Life only relies on such a broken small boat.</p>
<p>In our hometown, every year in winter, many small boats, loaded with peanuts, are parked in every port in front of and behind the mountains. Every day, they carry a sack of peanuts on their backs and go to various villages and alleys to sell them;</p>
<p>"Long life fruit! Long life fruit for sale"! In this season, you can hear this short and harsh cry on any street or in any alley. This teases a group of children, who pester adults for copper coins to buy long life fruit, and the elders have to spend a few extra copper coins every day.</p>
<p>After they sell out the peanuts, the women go to the mountain mines to hammer stones; the men go to dig red mud, or work as small laborers in lime kilns. When the lunar new year comes, their whole family, old and young, carry bamboo baskets on their arms, or cloth bags on their shoulders, and go from house to house to beg for cakes, perform lion dances, and sing the money tree song. They can do everything. Because the villagers like to hear good words at the beginning of the new year, and do not want to be cursed, so as long as they can speak and sing, and add some auspicious words of "getting rich and blessed," then a piece of cake or two pieces of dumplings will not disappoint them. This is indeed a very good speculative career for them. After going out and peddling for a day, each person can get at least fifteen or sixteen catties of cakes and dumplings.</p>
<p>I remember in the early winter of a certain year, a peanut boat was also parked in the narrow port in front of our door. That boat was so dilapidated that it was almost about to sink. There were only two people on the boat, an old man in his fifties, and a little girl about twelve or thirteen years old. Like other peanut boats, they carried peanuts out to sell during the day and returned to sleep on the boat at night. However, every day when the old man went out to sell peanuts, he always left the little girl with double buns in the boat to guard it.</p>
<p>The boat had been parked in front of our door for many days, and I naturally gradually became acquainted with the little girl on the boat: and became friends with her, mixing together every day. I learned that her name was Xiao Xizi; she was the old man's granddaughter. As for her parents, she heard that they had died, she only knew that they had died in the water, but she didn't know in which year, which place, or how they died. However, her grandfather didn't let her know either.</p>
<p>As long as the old man was not there, I would run to the boat to play with her, and Xiao Xizi often secretly gave me many peanuts. But as soon as the old man came back, I would slip away, and Xiao Xizi would also run back to the cabin as if she were a mouse seeing a cat. It wasn't that the old man was fierce, he had never scolded us, he was also a kind old man, but children seemed to be a little afraid of adults.</p>
<p>In January of the following year, they also opened up like other peanut boats, and then took away my companion—the lovely Xiao Xizi! At this time, I felt infinite disappointment and loneliness, as if I had lost a heart.</p>
<p>That winter, the peanut boat came again as usual, but it didn't bring back my companion. Later, I went to ask the old man, and he only coldly replied: "She is dead"!</p>
<p>In the third year, at this time in the peanut season, I didn't see the old man's broken boat anymore, and another peanut boat had replaced it in the port in front of our door.</p>
<h3>Homesick Patient</h3>
<p>— Jing Yao</p>
<p>On our ship, there is an old fellow who everyone calls crazy. The second day I came to this ship, people told me:</p>
<p>"That old drunkard is crazy."</p>
<p>Yes, he does love to drink a bit. There's always a wine bottle slanting in his pocket. His face is always so red. Whenever he does something, he takes the wine bottle out of his pocket, tilts his head, puts the mouth of the bottle to his lips, and watches his dry, wrinkled arms with blue veins bulging. A gurgling sound comes from his throat. A few big gulps of wine, and it's gone into his belly. Immediately, his scattered eyes have more light, and he has more energy to do things. It's like he can't live without drinking.</p>
<p>Saying he's crazy, well, that's not necessarily true. Looking at his face under his white hair, he always looks locked in gloom. He doesn't like to talk, and no one talks to him. He's often looking at the distant sea in solitude. It's as if there's something he's longing for in the distant sea. Maybe his temper is a bit strange? Crazy? I think that's a rumor about him.</p>
<p>"Don't make trouble! He's such an old man."</p>
<p>"It's true! Don't you believe it?" The partner who told me this got agitated by my words and started arguing.</p>
<p>"I didn't believe it like you did before, but then I found out. Don't believe it? Let's try it." He pulled me to stand in front of the old fellow on the deck.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old drunkard..."</p>
<p>He was staring at the distant sea in a trance, his hands on the ship's railing, his whole body leaning slightly forward. Looking at his pale green, thin face from the side, he looked so indifferent, not at all… Looking at his solemn, gloomy expression, it's really impossible to guess what's hidden in his aging body, in that aging heart. What is he thinking? What is he longing for?</p>
<p>"Hey! Old drunkard! Is the wine you're drinking today good?"</p>
<p>"Wine? Is this even wine? The water in the Hetao area in our hometown is stronger than this." The old fellow's words were just as indifferent. He didn't turn his head away from gazing at the distant sea, he just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"So, when are you going home?" My partner winks at me.</p>
<p>"Go home?" Those words seemed to stab him in his wound, and he turns around to retort. His eyes are burning with red threads, as if they are on fire. His face is gradually turning pale.</p>
<p>"Dreaming of going home! Go home? The train isn't free. If it were ten years ago, I'd crawl back; but now my legs are old! Old!" As he said this, the sadness of old age floats up, like the dusk on the sea.</p>
<p>"I've wanted to go home for so many years. I can only dream about it. You see this wine bottle, it's been with me all these years, I rely on it to dream, as soon as I drink wine, I'm home. Haha, old friend!" He takes out his wine bottle again.</p>
<p>The old fellow puts the wine bottle to his mouth, gurgling as he drinks, mumbling as he goes:</p>
<p>"I have a home, and it's so good! There are mountains, there is water, there are herds of sheep, there is bleached snow, there are big pine trees, there are purple mountain grapes, there is better wine than this, there is..."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but ask:</p>
<p>"Where is your home?"</p>
<p>"My home? My home is right there!" He points to the sea shrouded in twilight with his wine bottle.</p>
<p>In that distant sea, there are a few seabirds flying. The infinitely distant distance, dyed with dusk, faintly has a few sails appearing and disappearing.</p>
<h3>On the Banks of the Irrawaddy River</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Except for two seasons, the gentle breeze from the Irrawaddy River will blow through the coconut groves. The days pass slowly under the scorching sun throughout the year. During a languid midnight, wrapped in a light and smooth Changjiang Man cloth, lying on a bamboo-mat-covered bed, listening leisurely to the wind chimes on the golden pagoda, scattering a lonely melody; the coconut groves send out the songs of Burmese women, gently harmonizing with the low-pitched steelpan piano. The original lively and unrestrained style of the South Island penetrates the deep and helpless sorrow of a lost country. The melody drags the tail of the sound for a long time, slowly fading away in the lonely wind chimes, fading away. What remains is a lazy and verdant coconut grove, with squirrels chirping and jumping comically on the large leaves of the coconut trees. A kind of indescribable fatigue lightly floats through my heart. This midnight on the equator makes me forget the scorching sun and the bitterness of wandering in a foreign land.</p>
<p>In the distance, crows cry mournfully. It is the time when the market disperses, and the Burmese have spent another day quietly.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the door, the scorching wind blows over from the river. My head is a little dizzy. The coconut tree leaves shield the sun above my head, and when the river breeze gently blows through the leaves, fragmented sunlight is filtered down onto the green grass. In front of me, the blue Irrawaddy River quietly ripples and flows eastward. Looking far away, the coconut groves on the opposite bank also quietly and verdantly lean against the solemn and silent green peaks, appearing as a lush green. The high sky is endlessly blue, without a single cloud. Sometimes, a few eagles will fly over, circling with a free and proud posture. Looking along the river, the distant mountain scenery and green shadows vaguely cut off the ribbon-like river flow. At this time, a sampan leisurely descends from the upper reaches, its white sails appearing and disappearing through the shadows of the coconut tree leaves as it flows downstream. The Burmese boatmen on the boat, with their bare, dark backs, look up blankly at the green shade on the shore, perhaps envying the coolness of the coconut trees and weary of the painful life on the water. When the white sails vaguely disappear into the green shadows, like a gypsy's light sorrow, it bites at my heart, causing me to sigh leisurely.</p>
<p>At the edge of the coconut grove, there is a flat dirt road that stretches straight to the southern fields. Looking along the dirt road, a golden and abundant rice field indicates that it is the harvest season. At this time, a cart creaks and staggers past. The Burmese women inside the cart emit a frivolous laughter, calling out: "Deru, Deru." —Chinese—…</p>
<p>The sound of the oxcart gradually fades away, fades away. Suddenly, with a "honk" sound, the momentary silence is broken, and a steamship with the British flag flies away across the river. The quiet river surface suddenly stirs up restless waves, and white water splashes onto the green grassy bank, hissing and rustling. The thick smoke in the air stretches long at the top of the coconut grove, like a black python coiling there, opening its mouth wide, greedily devouring everything on the banks of the Irrawaddy River!</p>
<p>The river surface gradually calms down. In the distance, mournful crow calls rise again. The wind chimes on the golden pagoda still scatter a lonely melody. The days pass slowly under the scorching sun throughout the year, and now it is the harvest season again. However, decades of insatiable exploitation have forced the Burmese to hide in the coconut groves, supporting their work-worn bodies and minds, and watching the black python circling over the Irrawaddy River, singing the deep and helpless song of a lost country.</p>

<p>This year we happily celebrate the National Goods Year, when countrymen love their country above all else.华洋雜處春申地, 商埠繁華孰並肩, Every time the lamps are lit, the streets are bustling one after another. The people mostly like foreign goods, causing the country to be weak and the people to be poor, which is truly pitiful. How many leakages are hard to calculate, causing people to sigh as if enduring torture. Therefore, countrymen advocate for Chinese goods, and national goods markets are established everywhere. They frequently use words to promote them. Most hateful are those who like to use Japanese goods, forgetting their grievances and greedily taking advantage of cheap prices. They earn our money to build guns and cannons. Their evil hearts are as poisonous as arsenic. I hope my compatriots will quickly awaken and not be as if drunk or in a dream. If we can resolutely resist, and learn from Goujian's perseverance, we can guarantee that the Japanese invaders will meet their end. Commercial competition is the trend of today, and any style is valuable if it is fresh. We should understand that economic aggression has plagued us for years, more so than tens of thousands of military feats. From now on, do not use foreign goods to avoid leakages to foreign countries. I advise you not to just pay lip service.</p>

<p>Opening "Wild Goose"</p>
<p>Wild geese shadows fly south across the blue sky. The distant Western Mountains accompany the road's splendor. Yet only the sound vanishes beyond Hengyang with no information. Startled by the cold, the vast water elaborates white clouds. The long sky's wild goose script conveys letters. The early new autumn this year quickly arrives. I sigh for the traveling husband far away. The long journey extends to Yanmen Pass. A beautiful woman suddenly dreams of longing. Boundless sorrow fills her heart. She only thinks of her good man serving in the military. I do not know what day he can return south. A line of intimate geese cry in the sky. I imagine tonight they will rest on the reed shoal. I only see those married pairs of geese. The bridal chamber's red candles light up double brilliance. Brothers all enjoy family happiness. Harmony unites as hands and feet follow along. Therefore, harmony can not be scattered. The solitary leader possesses power. Where have the snow marks and goose tracks gone? Everywhere one hears they are under command. Righteousness surpasses the sky, admired for thousands of years. A feather hopes to return south. Cat tails flower and white waves compete in flight. The sand bar shakes feathers now and again. A bay of green water happily ripples. A sad cry evokes feelings of home. Next year, the autumn wind may arrive again. I happily see the returning wild geese.</p>

<p>Duke Yin Asks About the Number of Feathers (Continued)</p>
<p>Since King Cheng used the rites and music of the Son of Heaven to worship the Duke of Zhou, it has been hundreds of years to Duke Yin. With the virtue of King Cheng, he bestowed them, and with the virtue of Bo Qin, he received them. The world did not know that it was wrong. Later, they were used in the temples of the dukes, and the country did not know that it was wrong either. Duke Yin was born hundreds of years later and was the only one who could doubt the mistakes of hundreds of years. However, he was uneasy and asked about it. His natural talent was high. Zhong Zhong told him about the proper rites of the former kings, so that the offering of six feathers could be seen again at the banquet of Zhong Zhi. It cannot be said that it was without benefit. However, the question of Duke Yin was not only for the temple of Zhong Zi. It was only because of the temple of Zhong Zi that he raised the question. Zhong Zhong fully explained that the Duke of Zhou created rites and music to bring about peace. The Son of Heaven used eight rows, and the dukes used six rows. This was the music created by the Duke of Zhou. The Duke of Zhou created the number of this music and dance because he wanted to practice it in the world and pass it on to future generations. The Duke of Zhou wanted to practice it in the world, but his descendants had already disrupted it. He wanted to pass it on to future generations, but he had already violated it after his death. If the Duke of Zhou had known, I know he would not have enjoyed the sacrifices of Lu.</p>

<h3>In the Rumors of "Suicide," Keen Harro's Attachment to This World (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>"Also, I like to wear pajamas the most. Pajamas are my weakness. I always like to wear pajamas when I have a casual meal at a friend's house. If I have a banquet tonight and must wear formal wear, Blanc has already prepared my formal wear and all the small things without me saying a word. But when I want to go to an informal dinner and wear pajamas, she tells me that the pajamas have been sent to the laundry. Of course, I have more than a dozen pairs of pajamas, and they would never all go to the laundry. But Blanc doesn't let me wear pajamas, so I have to wear formal wear.</p>
<p>"Cleaning the room is originally the duty of a male servant, but since Blanc came, she has never let a male servant enter my bedroom, dressing room, and bathroom. She always cleans and wipes herself. My underwear, socks, handkerchiefs, and everything close to my skin, she also refuses to take outside, always washing them herself. Whether I get up early or come home late, she is always by my side. She always refuses to leave before I am asleep. If I invite friends to dine at home, she doesn't go on her holidays. She doesn't trust others to do her job. She can distinguish the good from the bad. When unreliable people come, she always comes in and out of my room, never leaving my side. She can find things to do, walking back and forth, and secretly monitoring that person.</p>
<p>"Also, I am naturally lazy and like to put good things to do today until tomorrow. Blanc often reminds me every morning of what I should do or should reply to a letter. I say, "Okay, I'll do it later." Blanc must wait until the "later" time comes before she will stop. For example, if I promise to return someone's call, and the time comes, if I don't return that person's call, she will connect the phone, making it impossible for me to delay. I don't break my promises to friends, mostly because of Blanc's help. Although I felt she was annoying at the time, I am very grateful to her afterward.</p>
<p>"Blanc has a deep understanding of me. I'm afraid no one understands me more deeply except my mother. She knows all my temperaments, personalities, habits, hobbies, etc. She knows my various faults, laziness, forgetfulness, wastefulness, often not wearing socks, and walking out wearing long pants, putting things to do today until tomorrow. She knows all this, but she still loves me.</p>
<p>"All women, when they are in front of men, always act a little, whether they are fathers, brothers, or husbands. This acting, or unconscious, is always an acting. When they arrive in their private rooms, when they sleep or get up, bathe, or dress, that is their real life, without any acting. At that time, in that place, all the defenses are removed, and all the covers are stripped off. This is the true nature of naked women. What Blanc knows about me is the naked me.</p>
<p>"When I leave this world and go to another world, I also want her to tell people about me like this, and what I want to remember and cherish is all the trivial things I said above, socks, long pants—that kind of loyalty, that kind of care, that kind of love is rarely described in words."</p>
<p>"Strangely enough, last night I was flipping through my scrapbook with newspaper headlines pasted on it, recording my life's deeds. Some were accurate, some were inaccurate, some were praising, some were sarcastic. I thought that if I died, these things would be remembered. What I want to remember and take to another world are just some daily trivialities."</p>
<p>Keen Harro's words are finished. Will she commit suicide? Suicide, suicide, is all because there is nothing to miss in this world. It must be known that suicide is ultimately a sign of cowardice. It is useless to oneself, and people will laugh at it after death, at most gaining some pity. If you don't want to commit suicide, you must be able to understand the love of life, appreciate the beauty of life, and have an attachment to life, like Keen Harro. A person like Keen Harro will never commit suicide. She can appreciate the love and expectations of others for her. She doesn't want to let herself down, others down, or the world down. Even if she is oppressed and tormented by the environment, she will not lightly yield. (End)</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Adventure Girl"</h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>Adventure Girl is showing at the Great Shanghai.</p>
<p>After many so-called hero adventure movies, the producer gives us this "Heroine's Adventure". This is aimed at "Go see how women go on adventures" and the "business eye" of people who are tired of watching the previous kind of works. If you make any excessive demands on things produced from this "business eye", it is naturally afraid that it will be difficult to fulfill them.</p>
<p>Here, apart from the lack of a strict structure, the lack of a central story, and only travel, objectively for national aggression and subjectively for self-enrichment adventures, these are not much different from all similar works.</p>
<p>The whole film is said to be made according to the female protagonist's own writings, narrating her adventure experience travelogue. Although there is also Herman Ravmaker, who is said to have directed it, the film is really not brilliant enough, and strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as a dubbed news film or travel record.</p>
<p>With the female protagonist Joan Lowell—that is, the character in the play—and a sailor Su Yi as the center, it is divided into several sections. First, it starts with Joan and the others setting sail, followed by the shipwreck in the howling wind, Su Yi falling into the water, and Joan swimming to save him. The next morning, Joan and others searched a wrecked ship and found a map recording the location of the gems, and decided to find it. However, because the drinking water on the ship was cut off, in the difficulty of thirst, they had to go ashore to duel with poisonous snakes and beasts to obtain drinks. From this scene to their destination, a certain island, they went to the place where the gems were stored with the queen of the natives. Because stealing gems violated the religious sanctity of the natives and the ancestors of the queen, they were captured by the natives and burned alive. While the delicate body was being burned and the natives celebrated their victory, Su Yi rushed to save her, and after experiencing some thrilling pursuits, they escaped onto their own ship and sailed away.</p>
<p>Although the story is not sound enough, it can be regarded as having some plot. If the director could structure it more and use some film art techniques, it would be much better than what is currently being shown.</p>
<p>What is now shown on the screen is full of inconsistencies and clumsiness everywhere: such as the ship's hull and the items in the cabin, most of the wood and iron are old, broken, and unbearable, but the box containing the map is uniquely intact. What the picture tells the audience is obviously only five coconuts were carried back to quench their thirst, but then it is written that the problem of drinking water was completely solved. There is a gun in Su Yi's hand, which has frightened countless wild birds, but in the fight with the queen's chief adjutant and in the many fights where she was desperately chased by the natives, she never fired a shot. How inconsistent is this! As for writing the so-called native empress so mediocre that she looks like a bowing oriental maid, and there are white people in Western clothes mixed in the native group, this is not only untrue, but also completely loses the power of the play. From the queen's helplessness, it is obvious that she is a very untrained temporary actor. In addition, the not-so-beautiful stream scenery and the water flowing in the lush forest are repeated again and again without principle or necessity. When writing about sailing in extreme crisis, one must also start from the heavy cable machine, the anchor cable gradually comes out of the water, the sail rope is untied, and the sails are gradually raised one by one, and then the ship moves. These completely cannot see a trace of so-called editing techniques.</p>
<p>If there are any advantages, it is that the suffering of the lack of water in the ship in the front is deeply and concisely written with scenes of the cat's tongue stretching out, its feet grasping the basin, and the people's exhaustion, etc.</p>
<h3>The Stars in "The Night in Young"</h3>
<p>— Yun Shui</p>
<p>"The Night in Young", hailed as MGM's greatest musical and dance blockbuster of 1935, is now being released by "Nanjing". This is an artistic work that directly pursues "The Cat and the Fiddle". Only in the handling of the story, the background is turned into a palace, and the male and female protagonists are all brilliant big stars in Hollywood: Ramon Novarro... Ramon is a handsome and good-singing young man that everyone knows. Since he emerged in "Ben-Hur" in the silent film era, he has become a standard handsome man and a hero in the dreams of heterosexuals. Later, he co-starred with Garbo in the famous historical film about the German female spy Mata Hari, translated as "Mata Hari". His most recent work last year was "The Cat and the Fiddle" with Jeanette MacDonald. Of course, his singing talent won him a great victory here again. Ramon is Mexican. He was born in Durango on February 6th. He is rich in the study of drama, and the color of his hair and eyes is especially stimulating for Exotio (this is of course a white people's word). In "The Night in Young", he plays the Duke Paul of that kind.</p>
<p>Evelyn Laye... Evelyn is a famous singer on the British stage. Later, she joined the film and was recruited by MGM to Hollywood. She was born in London on July 10th. She now plays the actress Lise in the film.</p>
<p>We at least have a considerable understanding of the other five big stars. They are Holden, the humorous founder of the ambassador who once played "The Merry Widow". He has also appeared in famous films such as "Diary of a Lost Girl" and "The Passionate Plumber". The audience probably also likes his Zhuang Xie and wonderful art. He is Baron Schleinitz in this film. And that nice guy C. Bugger-Worth is here again. The fat man who plays the waiter is the famous German comedian Hermann Piff. And the one who plays Otto is Henry Stephenson. As for the two actresses, the one who plays Lise's companion Fanny is the exquisite Una Merkel. The one who plays the Laifei woman is the graceful Rosaline Russell.</p>
<p>Ramon Novarro and Evelyn Laye in "The Night in Young", MGM's greatest song and dance palace musical structure of this year—now showing in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Star Anecdotes</h3>
<p>(1) "Night-Blooming Jasmine Has Already" completed one-third, and director Cheng Bugao is now actively engaged in the dubbing work of the film.</p>
<p>(2) "Nostalgia" filmed a scene at an orphanage yesterday, with as many as two or three hundred child actors.</p>
<p>(3) In "When the Flowers Fall", there is a great trench set, which is now being built in a hurry. In the past few days, the Mingxing outdoor studio has been covered with wire mesh and sandbags. After this scene is finished, "When the Flowers Fall" will be completed.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (8)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Kitty said, "Don't embarrass him. The mistake is not only on him." Wellington smiled and walked out. Francis's husband was a tall, thin man, very young. He had taken off his coat, but he was still wearing his hat and his face was full of anger. Wellington politely asked him to sit down, but he didn't sit. Wellington smiled and said, "Your wife's friendship is a great honor. Please sit down." The man said angrily, "Of course, I can't listen to you alone."</p>
<p>Wellington said, "I am a soldier, and I am willing to be a gentleman. Of course, you must also listen to your wife." The man said sharply, "You ordered everyone to stay in Brussels and wrote a letter asking my wife to leave. What's the reason?" Wellington said, "To let her return to London to welcome you back." The man asked again, "Why didn't she?"</p>
<p>Wellington was about to stammer and couldn't explain why, when suddenly Francis walked in and shouted, "Weber, I'll tell you..." Her face was pale and her lips were slightly trembling. She continued, "I heard there was a war there, and I want to take a look. When Napoleon was defeated, I was near Waterloo. I had the opportunity to see Wellington fight. Don't you want me to see it?" Her husband scolded angrily, "What does this have to do with Paris?" Francis said, "Then you say I love the Duke of Wellington? That's right, I love him, but not in the way we understand it... You can also say it is admiration and respect, because one day in the future, history will record: he is the only great man, loyal minister, and warrior..."</p>
<p>"She said, sobbing. She choked and said, "But, Weber, I still love you." She fell into her husband's arms. The anger on her husband's face also disappeared instantly. He kissed her fiercely. Wellington watched, smiled, bowed, and withdrew.</p>
<p>Kitty was waiting for him in the hall. She said, "Aser, I want to keep Webster here for dinner. Is that okay?" Wellington smiled and said, "Very good, who wants him to let Francis sit on my right! You, sit opposite me." Kitty asked again, "Can you stay at home for a few more days this time?" Wellington said, "I have to go back to Paris first and arrange for the Duchess of Anoel. I can tell you the details of this disaster now. This is the conspiracy of that woman. She spent money and bribed an unscrupulous London newspaper reporter to write this piece of news for her. She had no other way, so she used this last despicable method." Kitty said, "That's also very pitiful."</p>
<p>In the palace in Paris, Louis was sitting on the real throne as usual. His foolish face still showed a look of anxiety. Outside the palace gate, there was a clamor. A group of angry people approached the palace gate. Their shouts shook the sky, getting louder and louder. Louis panicked and said, "The crowd is getting bigger and bigger. Why doesn't anyone go to suppress them?" The Duchess of Anoel stood beside Louis, silent. Her face was pale and her heart was full of fear. Louis said again, "Why did you insist on me signing the death sentence of General Nan Yi? According to my idea, I was not willing to do that, but now that the person is dead, what can I do?"</p>
<p>Anoel said angrily, "Why? Just because I want you to show your authority. You are the king of a country. Shouldn't traitors die?" Louis sighed helplessly, "Ah, if only Wellington would come." Anoel said proudly, "He won't come." Louis sighed again, "It's all because of that boring love affair. Who did that thing?" Suddenly there was a loud noise outside, and the rioting crowd had rushed into the palace!</p>
