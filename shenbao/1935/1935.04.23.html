<h3>法俄協定之波折</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自去春法俄接近以來。兩國代表。於國際壇玷之間。極盡一唱一和之能事。以是兩國先則有東歐公約之擬議。繼則有法國介紹蘇俄加入國聯之行動。其後更屢有法俄締結軍事同盟之傳說。自表面觀察。一若兩國外交和洽無間。更無參商之處。唯至最近法俄協定之草案宣露而後。始知法俄一年來之親密。固為事實。唯於締結軍事上之攻守同盟。似乎尙有間題。蓋法國所欲與俄締結者。仍為國聯機構內之協定。而蘇俄所期望者。則為自動的互助公約。前者以西歐之洛迦諾約為範式。後者則類乎戰前之攻守同盟也。據二十日歐電。李維諾夫以法國不能接受其自動互助之建議。突然終止巴黎之行。於此可知法俄兩國之交懽。雖已一年有餘。然其意志期望。迄今尙未能一致也。</p>
<p>法俄所以欲締此協定之原因。不外三端。一則蓋恐德國無意於東歐公約之訂立。故欲以此替代東歐公約之效用。二則蓋欲藉此以壓迫德國對於東歐公約之接受。三則萬一德國能加入東歐公約。則卽可以此協定作為東歐公約之副約。蓋一九二五年西歐洛迦諾約成立之時。法與波蘭捷克。亦曾分別締結此類協定。以輔助洛迦諾約之功用也。而今次之法俄協定。無非欲提前締結。藉以壓迫德國之就範耳。據九日日內瓦電。法俄協定草案之內容。大抵以國聯會章為根據。是此協定之性質。純與西歐洛迦諾約相似。尤興輔助洛迦諾約之法波法捷條約類同。一言以蔽之。此等條約之功用。無非欲於國聯之範疇內。求國聯制裁之運用。與戰前之攻守同盟。頗有差別也。其間差別。我人祇須一檢洛迦諾公約中之規定。卽可瞭然。據該約第四條之規定而觀。締約國之一方。若認另一方有侵略之行為。應舉實報吿國聯行政院。一待行政院査實之後。始能立卽通吿締約國。援助被侵之一方。此與攻守同盟之自動的互助。顯有不同。其所以有如是之規定者。無非欲以是非責任。决於國聯。不使好戰者有所假借耳。唯於國聯行政院對於報告書不能一致接受時。各國為維特正義公道之必要計。始得採取自由行動之權。（見洛約第二欵及法波法捷條約第一欵）。關於自由行動。其手續之愼重。於此可見一斑。故洛迦諾條約之功能。不僅在保障法國之安全。同時亦使法國不能自由進侵德國也。當時英國之所以肯為此約之担保者。卽由此約有此維護和平之精神耳。今法國所欲與蘇俄締結之協定。欲獲英國之贊助。自必不能超越洛約之成例。否則得一蘇俄而失一英。於法殊不合算也。</p>
<p>唯蘇俄方面。似乎着眼於軍事行動上之敏捷。不欲聽候第三團體之决議。致誤臨時軍事上之機宜。故主張自動的互助。而不以國聯為本體。此種條約茍能成立。則其制德之力量。自較洛迦諾式之條約為强。然以東歐之情勢論。蘇俄現為波蘭所疑懼。設法俄協定而果與以前之攻守同。盟相同波蘭將感不安。方今法於波蘭。正圖親善。此亦法國對於法俄協定所以堅持以國聯為本體之一因。雖然。蘇俄若以自衛為目的。同時復顧及法國之願望。則法俄協定。雖多波折。終有相互締結之可能耳。</p>

<h3>同泰莊昨停業</h3>
<p>吳陳兩律師代表宣吿淸算新聲社云、滬工商業四底轉瞬將屆、錢業同業公會會員永興錢莊、前日停業淸理後、昨晨同泰順記錢莊、亦因週轉不靈、停業淸理、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>該莊歷史</p>
<p>伺泰匯劃錢莊、創立於民國十年一月、資本總額爲三十四萬元、股東原爲譚步韶六股·樂振葆二股·譚子臨一股·黄振榮一股、總共分十股、經理爲傅裕齋·恊理傳裕經·地址北市寗波路二四〇號、於民國二十三年總結賬時、改組成功、股東樂振葆·黄振榮·拆股、譚步韶再增二股、爲八股、譚子臨再增一股、爲二股、幷改爲同泰順記、經理協理照舊、</p>
<p>前晚難關</p>
<p>該莊營業、爲數頗鉅、恒在一二百萬元以上、今因受市面不景氣影響、以致放出之欵、如信用長期、往來透支、貸物抵押等、無法收還、該莊缺乏流動金、於前晚八時、因收進與解出、相差甚鉅、以致周轉不靈、形勢甚爲危急、幸經理傅裕齋·傅裕經·之奔走、卽由股東墊欵維持、渡過難關、故昨晚錢業同業公會之同業公單、亦如數解淸、</p>
<p>決定停業</p>
<p>前晚經股東墊欵維持渡過後、錢莊同業等、均以爲該莊可無問題矣、但該莊經理傅裕齋與股東譚步韶譚子臨臨時</p>
<h3>交行昨開董監會議　增選常務董事兩人　董事長總經理照舊</h3>
<p>中央社云、交通銀行增加官股一千萬元、經股東總會通過後、並由財部派定王儒堂等八人、分任官股董事及監察人、該行全體董事及監察人、於昨午、分別舉行會議、增選宋子良·楊效甫·爲常務董事、至董事長及總經理、未有更動、詳情錄後、</p>
<p>增選常務　董事二人</p>

<p>董事長總經理聯任</p>
<p>該行董事長、依條例規定、須由財部於常務董事中指派一人担任之、總經理則由董事長商同常務董事、於董事中選定、提經董事會同意聘任、査該行現任董事長胡筆江·總經理唐壽民、自就任以來、業務猛進、本年度該行資產總額、較上年竟增至七千萬元之鉅、官商各方對之、均表信任、故仍由兩氏蟬聯、經董事會商定、當由宋子良偕錢新之、晋謁孔財長報吿、並携來委狀加委、</p>
<p>監察會議同時舉行</p>
<p>監察人會議、同時於該　舉行、到官股監察人　脩直·張嘯林·趙棣華、商股監察人葉崇勳·鄒敏初。賈士毅·等、由趙棣華主席、行禮如儀後、當由主席報吿、依該行章程第二十四條規定、請推選常駐監察人一人、結果仍由許修直担任、</p>
<p>內部組織未有變更</p>
<p>據記者探悉、該行增加股東後、除由財部增派董監事八人外、內部組織、未有變更、惟以前一切行務、由總經理處理、現在規定、常務董事亦須常川到行、執行職務、故其業務、當日益發達云、會議之結果、因放出之欵、一時難以收回、而外面危險之空氣已洩出、萬一各存戶紛紛提欵、勢必無法應付、决定昨晨起停業、於是該莊於昨晨實行停止營業、</p>
<p>宣告清算</p>
<p>該莊决定停業後、已委託同仁法律事務斯吳麟坤·陳忠蔭·律師、宜吿停業淸理、該律師公吿云、頃據同泰順記莊、經理傅裕齋·副經理傅裕經·來所聲稱、敝莊因受市面不景氣影饗、以致週轉不靈、不得不停止營業淸理賬目、爲此委託貴律師代表公吿、限各債務人於十四日內到敝莊淸算處淸償債務、逾期不理、卽請依法訴追、至於各債權人亦統希於十四日內、持同債權憑證、向敝莊淸算處登記等語、前來、據此、爲特代表公吿於右、卽希公鑒、四月二十二日、</p>

<h3>藝展　預展第十五日</h3>
<p>昨日（廿二日）為倫敦中國藝術國際展覽會上海預展第十五日、昨日為星期一、照例上午停止參觀、但該會重要職員、仍照常到會辦公、下午自一時起、照常開放、到會參觀者仍然擁擠、尤以各校學生爲多、蓋團體票星期一下午可待入參觀也、葉恭綽氏近亦運日到會參觀、葉氏爲書晝家、故對於書畫、特別感覺濃厚之與味、該會此次陳列書畫、各家都有、有用筆工緻者、有用筆粗勁者、大抵工緻者宜近觀、組勁者宣遠觀、自然興趣無窮、如文徵明·仇英之畫、即宜近觀、一草一木、一屋一橋、人物山水、備極工緻、若忽略過去、即難得其妙、如董北苑龍宿郊民圖、米芾春山瑞松圖、即宜遙觀、則覺氣魄雄渾、譬如千山萬壑、悉在吾前、可得自然之妙、其他如瓷銅器等、則宜細審其花紋與品質、將歷代出品加以比較、觀覽玉器景泰藍等、宜具有美術的觀念、觀覽考古選例、可引人回憶昔民之生活、如將此九百餘件古物遍覽一遍、確當增進知識不少也、中國畫與西洋妥不同、茲將該會所撰書畫說明第四章中國畫之特點、及其繪畫之法、披露於後、</p>
<p>國畫之特點及繪法</p>
<p>以上二系、（指山水人物寫生三系）不過就各人所專精者而言、往往一人而擅三長、茲亦母庸贅述、惟中國之畫、幾於純全可以表現作者之人格、性情、與趣、此一點爲研究中國畫者所必需明瞭及承認者、其所以如此之故、（二）因藝術與人生幾於打成一片、（二）因畫法完全與書法相通、（三）因所用之工具及便用之法、均甚微妙、故得形成此項結果、中國畫具、純用毛筆、復有粗細剛柔之別、每落筆後、即不再改、故山水之皺染、與堆砌塗飾不同、而力量及趣味、即寓其中又陰陽向背及諸比例、雖不十分嚴格、而大體不至差違、亦因有氣勢爲之籠罩映帶也、又用墨及用各顏色、除特別注意其研磨調凍之法外、其用時、復因著筆之先後、用力之輕重、水與各色、曁色與色間配合之成分、以及筆與紙（或絹）及顏色三方面相接觸時、錯綜融會、而產生之光彩及情味、因而構成種種之功能、故製紙絹顏料、筆及畫時、對紙絹顏料之加工、（如紙先水濕、絹先上攀、及調色須用某種質地之水等等、）亦須特殊之技術、即如筆之種類、即有三四十種之多、他司知也、至用紙絹之外、有繪之建築物及器皿上者、有用指用舌用刷而不用筆者、此外尙有火晝、鐵畫、紙織畫、貼絨畫者、應列於美術工藝內、尙有一節應聲明者、中國畫固自有其眞面目與精神、然歷來所受外來之影響、亦復不少、如佛敎之傳豫、使節之交通、物產工要品之輸入、皆曾令繪畫之作風、發生甚大之衝動、但大半皆能咀嚼融化、而形成一本國色彩之作品、吐世界晝派中之東方畫派、所以必推中國爲巨璧也、（尙有此次書畫出品概要一章、明日續登）</p>

<p>中央社云、本市地產商人程霖生等、提議發行地產流通券四萬五千萬元、以資調劑金融、恢復工商業之衰落、以進行困難、故籌備數月、迄未就緒、該發起人程霖生等、又於昨日下午三時、假北山西路絲繭公所、舉行會議、討論四萬五千萬元地產流通券籌發事宜、茲將其會議情形、以及金融界對此問題之表示等、分誌如次、</p>

<h3>昆蟲學家張巨伯談　植物病害檢騐　我國蟲害損失　年達四十萬萬</h3>
<p>著名昆蟲學家浙江昆蟲局局長張巨伯氏、日前因公來滬、國民社記者特往訪謁、並叩詢張氏對於植物病蟲害檢騐之意見、據談輓近世界各國、對於植物病蟲害之防除工作、極爲重視、一方面悉心研究、殲除方法、切實指導農民、一方而釐訂檢騐法規、執行進出口植物之檢騐、辦理週密、成績斐然、直接消遏病蟲禍萌於無形、問接確立植物生產之保障、意義之重大、概可想見、顧我國固有之病蟲、已成極端嚴重亟待解决之問題、</p>
<p>每年損失</p>
<p>每年所受損失、恒在四十萬萬元以上、幾佔中央政府歲人六倍左右、而國外輸入之植物、仍復不加檢騐、自由運銷、漫無限止、於是國外危險蟲菌、乘機而入者不知凡幾、例如紅鈴蟲·棉產介壳蟲·小麥黑穗病等、均係海外傅入、近來流行頗廣、幾於無地無之、爲害之大、有非一般人意想所能及者、至若未輸入而有輸人可能性之蟲菌、亦在在堪虞、即以棉鈴象鼻蟲、及甘藍根腫病而論、在美國異常猖獗、農民損失不貲、如不幸傳入我國、則今後棉作蔬菜事業、寗堪設想、抑有不能已於言者、即異地輸入之病菌害蟲、其爲害之烈、每駕原產地而上之、蓋各國之環境不同、氣候各異、蟲菌之在原產地者、往往受天敵與氣候之制裁、或因常地寄生抵抗力之强大、而不能猖獗、一旦傳至異域、頓失其天然平衡狀態、每致釀成巨災、如法國山美國傳入之葡萄微病、美國由中國傳人之舍來壽介壳蟲、皆其明證也、雖然、此不過就防止國外蟲菌一方面而言之耳、</p>
<p>檢騐必要</p>
<p>若以對外貿易論、則我國輸出植物、向無法定機關檢騐證明　運年所遭損失、尤屬可驚、良以吾國農民、昧於病蟲害防治手續、以致輸出植物、往往附帶危險蟲菌、被外國檢騐人員全部燒棄者有之、責令退同原產地者亦有之、甚至以防止病蟲害之傳布爲”實、直接禁止中國植物及植物生產品進口、我國對外貿易之不振、此亦重要原因之一也、近聞實業部上海商品檢騐局、已舉辦植物病蟲害檢騐、無論爲本國計、爲世界計、均爲不容或綏之要圖、深望社會人士、勿目爲尋常問題而忽之也云、</p>

<p>五公司特函臻通崇海各縣縣長云、各港舢舨夫爭拉旅客、不顧載暈、迭次顛覆、再示禁、各港局遵辦者固多、一載以來、而藐示禁令者亦所在多有、如最近靈甸港之覆舢慘禍、山是該處舢舨夫之强悍性成、今此案尙在召集雙方、協議調解、並擬令各輪公司、轉責船員、不准舢舨再行靠搭、如再違誤、應該船員負全責等因、按政黨機關爲謀旅客安全、納入營業正規、一律禁止舢舨爭搭乘客、自應遵辦、但舢舨夫蠻橫異常、非口舌所能理喻、實在意中、除由公司知照各輪、自五月一日起、不開把門禁舢靠搭外、懇請縣府出示布吿實行日期、俾旅客不再受舢舨夫愚弄、倘旅客仍有誤乘舢舨、致遭風險、並令駐港軍警曁靖海艦隨時杳禁云、</p>

<h3>讀書運動最後一日　潘局長播大會閉幕詞　讀書運動之目的在建設新中國　讀害運動應擴大空間延長時間</h3>
<p>日昨爲中國文化建設恊會主辦之全國讀書運動大會之最後一日、由該會書記長潘公展局長在中西電臺播送全國讀書運動大會閉幕詞、該會連日敦請學者名流作學術系統播音演講、深爲學術界所注意歡迎、該會擬將紀錄稿請演講人員加以補充修正後、發刊於文化建設月刊、以應全國讀書者之需求、潘氏閉幕詞全文如次、諸君、今天是中國文化建設協會主辦全國讀書運動大會最後一天、由兄弟祖任致閉幕詞、讀書運動大會到今天果然宣吿結束、但讀書運動决不因大會之閉幕而閉幕、這一點、應請全國同胞注意的、</p>
<p>關於中國文化建設恊會這一次主辦讀書運動大會之意義、本會理事長陳立夫先生在南京中央廣播電臺演講「民族復興與讀書運動」的時候、已有精詳的報吿、演講詞並已刋載全國各大報、兄弟也不必再來贅述、「文化建設與讀書運動的關係」、本會副理事長吳鐵城先生在四月十五日那天、也已詳細地說過、一讀書運動與中國革命、的聯繫性、本會常務理事吳醒亞先生在四月八日那天、也已經和各位談過、致於讀書的方法、以及研究各科學術應持的態度、和應取的方法、業經學術界名宿蔡孑民王雲五等十一位先生加以提綱擷要的指示、演詞原文並經在各大報發表、全國靑年聽到或讀到了這許多先生的名言儻論以後、兄弟深信沒有讀書興趣的、一定能啓發他對於學術發奮研討的决心、有讀書興趣的、一定更能堅定他對於學術研討的信心、所以讀書運動大會之意義、在喚起全國靑年對於讀書的决心和信心、在引起對於讀書的堅决的動機所以大會固然照預定的日期而閉幕、而全國同胞對於讀書的興趣與研討學術的决心、我深心一定能因大會閉幕而興趣、格外提高、决心格外堅定、現在兄弟貢獻一點關於讀書運動的意見、希望全國靑年予以注意、各界同胞予以指敎、我們大家都覺得中國民族現已到了生死存亡的關頭、能否起死回生、全在我人對於中國的這一個病人、診療是否得法、調養能否合宜、假定在目前中國、我們能診療得宜、調養合度、那麽病之痊可不待言的、也許能比前更要康强、假定診療調養失宜、說不定病轉危急、而至於死亡、大革命後中國、時期之正如孕婦之生產、而大革命之艱難困苦、以及影響於一國之社會政治經濟各方面、較諸孕婦其難易之程度、大革命後之中國、亦如孕婦產後虛弱之身體、正在一個很危險的時期、產婦之喪亡、往往因產後調養之失當、革命有二大階級、一爲破壞、一爲建設、破壞恰當於孕婦之生產、建設恰當於產後之調養、我們因爲求社會政治經濟加速度之進步、所以有大革命之發勤、這革命運動破壞了一切陳舊腐惡的社會制度、政治制度、與經濟制度、以後便須建設、建設一個健全而合理的社會制度、政治制度、與經濟制度、假定祇有破壞而無建設、正如孕之祇知生產、不知調護、祇知生育、不知撫養、孕婦生產後而不知調護與撫養、母午皆危、革命而不知建設、則不特革命失敗、抑且有亡國滅種之禍、所以在現階段的中國、破壞工作、業已大致完成、今日唯一需要的、爲猛烈的建設運動、談到建設、便需要建設的材料、建設的人才、與建設的方法、沒有建設的材料人才方法、建設如何可完成、建設的材料是需要專門家技術家去獲得、建設的人才需要專門家技術家去培養、是需要智能、儘管有五年計劃、十年計劃、假定沒有建設的材料與人才、還是紙上談兵、智能之需要旣如是迫切、那麽培養智能充實智能當然是今日唯一的急務、於此可見讀書運動在現階段中國革命之迫切與需要、所以目前中國的讀書運動、是建設的讀書運動、是爲建設新中國而來的讀書運動、倘使到了現在一般靑年、還是像革命的暴風雨時代一樣、祇知破壞、不知建設、那麼正如孕婦之祗知生產、不知調護、祇知生育、不知撫養、一樣的危險、不特靑年自身深人歧途、葬送了一生的命運、而且國家民族也受到了重大的打擊、整個的革命運動必至於失敗之境、現階段的讀書運動是建設的讀書運動、這是應該希望大家深切體會、而嚴重注意的第一點、第二方才所說的似更偏重於專門研究、一方面要培養許多專家去建設新中國、這是指已受敎育或在受敎育的一般靑年、訓練自己成爲建設新中國的幹部人地、這當然是中國所急需的、不過我們在培植專門人才之餘、也不能忽略大多數的無知文盲、假定中國廣大的文盲不設法掃除、百分之八十以上的人民沒有受敎育的機會、那麼中國的革命還是不能完成、中國的建設事業還是要受到許多障碍、我國有四萬萬七千萬同胞、即使說中國文盲不到百分之八十、至少也有百分之七十、即以百分之七十而言也、有三萬萬二千九百萬不識字的廣大文盲、這廣大文盲而遺失在知識圈之外、中國一切的建設事業如何可完成、譬如建築、其基礎不固、其成就也必小、所以我們一方面要培養許多在學的靑年、已成敎育的靑年、成爲專門家、同時更須掃除中國廣大的文盲、我深信在這廣大文盲中間、一旦受了識字敎育以後、一定有許多出類拔萃的人才、可以發現、可以爲民挨國家而服務、現在中央以及各省市政府、都致力於掃除文盲運動、兄弟希望中國文化建設協會的全體會員以及全國的同志同胞、都來參加這掃除文盲大運動、要知道掃除文盲、也正是我們讀書運動的第二要義、第三方才兄弟講的第一點、是說讀書運動的目的在乎建設、第二點是說讀書運動、應該掃除文盲、擴大空間、第三點就是說讀書運動應該延長時間、要有永久性、方才已經說過、讀書運動大會的意義、在引起大衆讀書的動機、讀書的興趣、喚醒大衆如道讀書在現階段中國革命的重要性、所以動機與興趣引起了以後、讀書運動的重要性、明白了以後、大會國然閉幕而我們對於讀書這一件重要的工作、應該養成一個良好的恒久的習慣、人生四大需要爲衣食住行、我希望以後能變成衣食住行讀、視讀書如衣食住行一樣的爲人生日常不可或缺的需要品、無論工作如何繁重的人、每天都應該抽出一小時二小時三小時讀書的時間來、在學的靑年、尤應夙興夜寐、一卷在手、務期勉勵自已造成一個建設新中國的重要的幹部人才、讀書運動應爲一恒久性的運動、讀書應成爲每一個國民日常需要之一、這是讀書運動的第三個要義、在麻煩了許多先生替我們指示了許多研究學術的方法與態度以後、兄弟在大會閉慕的日子、貢獻上述三點意見、希望全國同志同胞、深切體味、身體力行、予以指正、完了、</p>

<h3>我做籃球裁判的哲學（一）</h3>
<p>— 美國達爾氏著錢一勤譯</p>
<p>此篇係美國著名籃球裁判員達爾氏　J.Dahl所著曾於本年正二月份美國運動月刊上發表、其思想新鮮、理論精詳、亟譯之、以作吾人之借鏡、譯者</p>
<p>著者最先欲使讀者明瞭者、彼决非欲敎導他人如何祖任籃球裁判之方法、蓋彼深信此殊非易事、因在一人爲有效之裁判方法、而在他人或摘得其反、成爲無用、雖在機械式的乎續上、有一股的規律、可以適從、固屬實在、然每一裁判員應盡量發展其個人之人格及技能、凡此種種、僅能由刻苦之工作及練習方可獲得最要者、任何裁判員或一派之裁判員、不應將其某派之人格及技能、灌注他人、</p>
<p>茲須冉三申明者、本篇所述、决無使讀者照其實行之意、須知本篇之材料實不過著者個人眞誠思想之表現、蓋其對於籃球遊戲及裁判、有莫大之興趣焉、</p>
<p>倘讀者對於此種見解、有幾部或全部之贊同、則著者已屬幸甚、即或不然、不獲同意、亦係理之當然、無足爲怪、因不同之見解、乃使世界進步之一原素也、</p>
<p>欲成功上乘之裁判、須由刻苦之工作及實習中得來、前已述及、茲有金律一則、俾凡自願以裁判成功而著名者、有所適從、即「將所見之比賽、盡量宣佈、不存私見、不可畏懼、尤須按規則施行」是也、</p>
<p>難免批評　裁判受人批評、在所難免、此爲担任裁判員最先須知者、裁判員在比賽終了後、能獲得各方面之美許者、司謂經無僅有、倘執行嚴厲、則不免一部人之惡評、倘稍示寬鬆、定受他一部分之反響、雖執法無私無畏、仍不免苛評、即或依照觀衆球員或敎練員之心理而施行判決、欲免批評者、亦不可能、故不論　何執法、絕無批評者、未之有也、</p>
<p>倘遇粗魯之比賽、而裁判疏忽、則球員之抗議、源源而來、遑論敎練員及觀衆之批評矣、倘有人認爲罰球過多、則亦定獲惡評、甚至於一隊有關之人士、因該隊球員體格魁偉、欲裁判執法寬鬆、而在下季該隊球員體格若係輕小、則又求執法嚴厲、不可輕鬆、是誠難爲以極、</p>
<p>由此看來、裁判僅有一法較為安全即「照其親自所目睹者、按規則而宣佈」是也、必如此、然後批評之至、百知無誤、捫心無愧矣反而言之、倘裁判寬鬆、則批評一至自知失檢、必無立足之地、然雖不論如何執法、批評終不可免、做裁判者、自應習以為常也、</p>
<p>夫則者、乃由規則委員會厘訂、用以增進技能、、（如傳遞·投籃等）而避免昔日籃球粗魯舉動之遊戲、雖有一部份人士、認爲籃球遊戲愈趨愈下、然此不過絕對少數人士之主張、善事宣傳耳就著者所知、千萬之球員者（老或幼敎練員及觀衆、皆不作如是之想、倘澈底追就、則敎練員或球員（甚至觀衆）其願觀依規則精神執法之比賽、較裁判寬鬆之比賽、趣味多端矣、</p>
<p>著者曾親自獲得以下之經騐、在某次比賽時、雙方球隊、原係勁敵、難免惡鬥、然比賽中裁判均頗驚奇、因雙方競爭雖烈、然殊淸潔、尤奇者、賽畢後其中某隊隊長（其隊素以粗魯聞名）向裁判員曰、「今晚比賽良佳、諸位之勞也、其中裁判之「答曰、」噫、非余所知、或汝等比賽純正、致余等無多事幹耳」、該隊長忽作驚人之回答曰、「讓余吿汝、今晚敎練員叮囑吾人盡力打球、故致忘打人矣」、</p>
<p>猶有未盡欲言者、有時在純潔之比賽後、或有三五觀衆、來至裁判員前、表示執法優良可慶之意、倘比賽粗魯、賽畢亦定有人趨前、惡言向相、必謂裁判爲惡劣之表演、其實在純潔之比賽中、裁判輕而易舉、因雙方球藝優良故也、明乎此、則粗魯之比賽中爲裁判員者、即或盡其所能、亦不獲佳評也、</p>
<p>觀點各異　茲就另一方面言之、裁判之宣佈比賽、係自其個人之觀點而觀、觀衆及敎練員則又各自彼等不同之觀點及角度、而所見者亦必迪異、有自一角度而觀之爲明顯之犯規、然自另一角度而觀之、則不然、是故在此比賽中、裁判所見者係一事、而觀衆自界外所見者另係一事、其理甚明、倘裁判員高座座邊、則必盡見觀衆之所見、但事屬不可能、在比賽時、運球球員與守衛球員發生接觸之情形中、此種理由、尤為確切、</p>
<p>自然許多犯規、自各方面觀之、均極明顯、且觀衆之判斷力、亦如裁判員然、倘斯時裁員將此種明顯之犯規、輕易放過、則其直自討苦吃耳、尙有一點不得不提及者、嘗聞裁判員曰、「余之執行裁判視比賽之情形及敎練員之要求而定、若彼等喜嚴、則嚴、喜寬、則寬」、著者會親耳聞某裁判員向一敎練問曰、「君今晚喜余如何執法、嚴乎、寬乎、」此實非著者之欲吹毛求疵、喜於評論他人之裁判方法、因此實無關我事、其所以舉以爲例者、深恐此種處執之方法有禍害也、規則上之有犯規之規定、實所以促球藝之進步、此種定義與規則後所載之解檡、均極明白、倘一裁判昌能作另外之解釋、則其所負之責任、未免過重、若能按規則委員會所規訂者而施行、必得優良之結果、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顏鑫泉）</p>
<p>假使有兩張信封，一張是國貨紙張製的，需銅元一枚，一張是洋紙製的，祇須錢五文，那麽我敢說：「誰都知道揀價廉的用，那裏還顧洋貨和國貨呢！」記得陳布雷先生曾經說：「提倡國貨，總要帶幾分獃氣和幾分勇氣，纔能殼收穫成効。』這話說得眞正不錯啊！</p>
<p>『識字人的多少，關係國家的强弱很鉅。』這是誰都不能否認的。故此近年來，各地都在鬧着識字運動，廣事宣傳，勸民衆識字。他們宣傳的工具，雖有表演，演講，…等，可是貼標語也視爲重要工作之一。像「識字的人是瞎子』等句，差不多觸目皆是。不過我以爲『對不識字的人，用字來勸導，這，未免是有些矛盾吧？』</p>
<h3>燕子</h3>

<p>在春眠不覺曉的一天早晨，起來時已是日上竿頭的時分了，一聲聲呢喃的唱呌，打我耳膜裏送來，燕子來了，心裏邊欣喜地，便興奮地踱到堂屋裏，迎接着它們似的。</p>
<p>瞧着它們剪也般的雙翼，雙雙地飛翔着，一會兒飛在堂屋裏打旋，一會兒又飛到照墻外邊去了。</p>
<p>因爲對於燕子太歡喜了，愛護地，搬着梯子在樑上給它們釘上了兩支釘，下邊又掛上一隻竹絲籃。釘是給它們依住着做巢，籃可受着一塗塗落下來的屎。</p>
<p>每天總要留心着踱到那邊去呆瞧它們一兩遍，它們辛勞地啣着帶些兒稻草層的田泥做巢了。這裏瞧出了它們把啣泥的不易呵，大概田泥有粘性的綠故吧，可是這田泥要到遙遠的太湖邊才有呢。</p>
<p>瞧着它們啣泥的過程裏，那堆砌着潤濕的泥巢，一天天地已乾燥了，這時節它們作巢的工程才吿一段落。</p>
<p>巢裏邊大概生產了蛋了，聽到了我的脚聲，有一隻伏在巢裏的燕子探出頭來，瞥了我一眼又安靜地縮進去了。</p>
<p>回想小時候，曉得燕子躱在裏邊的時候，是在孵蛋了，總會偸着蛋來玩，給媽見了老是嚇我說：「拿了燕蛋要害燕瘡的。」但是嚇不怕的我，蛋到了手一破就了事，並且失去蛋以後的老燕那急躁的情形，儘自不息地呌着在堂屋裏，現在想想太殘忍了，再也下不了這下手，讓它們把孵育出可愛的乳燕來吧。</p>
<h3>小動作</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>我近來有一種習慣，愛留意朋友們的小動作。</p>
<p>上司孫先生，年歲兒遝很靑，下頷上是每天刮得光光的，但是他却說不上三句話，便得把手在下頷上摸一摸。</p>
<p>同事老李，有搔頭皮的習慣，他一壁同人說話，一壁常用右手的無名指搔頭皮，而且總是不多不少的搔二搔。</p>
<p>還有一位同事老陳，站着的時候，總是把左手撩着長衫的下擺這和他的穿西裝的弟弟小陳，向人談話時，總是把衣鈕不停的解下扣上，可說是珠聯璧合，有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>阿梁，也是同事的，同人談話時，常把右眼梢和右嘴角，上下牽動着，像在和人做眉眼。但是沒人和他談話時，他的眼梢和嘴角，却也會靜北着，不動的。</p>
<p>書記胡女士，常把小手帕繞着右手上的無名指。伊一個人坐着轉念頭時，是那麽的用手帕繞手指。同人談話時，是那麽的用手帕繞手指。有時我同伊坐在一輛電車裏回去，在車中，也見伊用手帕在那裏繞手指。</p>
<p>劉女士，也是同事，沒有肺病的，但說話時，總是做着輕輕一聲二聲假咳嗽。不說話時，咳嗽也停止了。</p>
<p>這些小動作，似乎是沒甚注意的價値，但是你若留意了一二回，下次再見有這種表情時，肚子裏便會覺得十分好笑。</p>
<h3>新女性的歸宿</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳乖帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>月英頗也口渴，這就由帳門裏伸出手臂來，將茶杯端了進去。喝完了，依然把手臂送了杯子出來。兩隻手臂，在帳門子裏一進一出，這讓北海沒有心看到書本上去了，只不住向帳子望着。因道：你老睡在程先生床上，也不是辦法，你總要催家裏人快些拿衣服來換才好。月英道：我那有衣服換呢？我舅母把濕衣拿去烘烤去了，烘乾了，自然會拿來的。北海道：上次我看你穿的衣服，式樣很新，就只有那麼一身嗎？月英道：那是這裏茶房給借來的。北海道：旣是這裏茶房給借的，你本來還有一套衣服呢？月英道：那麽衣服，也是我們從西方來，在平凉遇到了一個大官，賞給我們三代的。我自己原來穿的衣服，破得穿不上身了。他提到了由西方來的這一層上去，這正打動了北海的心事，因爲有許多問題，都納悶在心裏的，今天好問上一問了。因道：我倒想起一件事來了。朱姑娘，你在甘肅住得好好的，爲什麽要向這裏來？月英道：也無非是日子過不下去呀。一家三代，都是女子，那是怎樣的了局。我們聽說舅舅在西安唱戲呢，就投到這裏來了，不想舅舅死了好久了。北海道：一個唱戲的，每月所掙也是很有限的錢，他就是還在，我想他也養活不起你這樣一家三口。（一八八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其他一切雜念，就爲伊們能如此的忠於厥職而不再發生了！那末伊們將來衰老以後的歸宿又如何呢？自然也和尋常的老年人有些不同的！待到伊們漸漸地衰老了，！大概也不過四五十歲就衰老了，因爲刺繡這一樣工藝是極費精力的，也是最容易使人衰老的。！伊們的目力已不够再做那樣精細的挑繡工作的時候，便自然就有新進的人替上來了，讓伊們留在宮內養老着，從此伊們便絕不活動了，儘是穿衣吃飯的閑住下去，一直到壽終正寢爲止。我想伊們大家都有一條傳統的觀念，就是當伊們年富力强，正可以盡量勞作的時候，便注其全力於這富於美化的工藝上；到得老來，就仗着這一些功績，安安穩穩的在宮內吃一口閑飯過日子。</p>
<p>這個觀念究竟是否正當？是否合理？於伊們自己是否有利？我當然不能代爲答復；便是伊們爲什麽要存這一條傳統的觀念，我也萬萬解說不出。我想除非我也能有像伊們一樣靈巧的手段，常在那些貢緞上挑繡挑繡花朶，如此的身歷其境的去體察，也許我才會體察出一個確當的原故來；如今徒然憑空懸想是斷乎想不出來的！</p>
<p>上面我不是說過，每一方貢緞上是有四五副鞋樣勾描着的；伊們把這一方貢緞棚到了那繡床上去之後，便由上至下的一副副挑繡起來。（二九八）</p>
<h3>富翁的生活</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，在富翁家裏當西席。從我的朋友口中，得知了這位富翁的有趣的生活片叚。</p>
<p>這位富翁的年紀，還不過四十多歲，是一家亨字號的錢莊，二家大典當，一家雙開間門面的百貨公司的老闆，此外自然還有不少大企業的股份。據說，動產和不動產，約有三百多萬，所以他的心事，倒並不在乎營業的盛衰，而在乎綁匪的光臨。</p>
<p>他在四年之前，曾被綁過一次。之後，特地僱了二位俄國的，四位本國的保鏢。分作二班，日夜的在住宅裏巡邏着。他通常是不出門的，整天整晚的躺在烟鋪上。偶因免不得而出門時，那麽至少有三位保鏢保護着。</p>
<p>因此，他的二位兒子，一位女兒，都是不進學校的，生怕在路上出岔子。可是在他家裏當西席，被聘時，須打一張舖保之外不算，每天上他家時，還得經保鏢的在身上搜査一遍咧。在他家當車夫傭僕，甚至於婢女之類，也非具二家可靠的保人，是不行的。</p>
<p>他家的窗子，是終年不開的。住宅四周的庭園裏，也是密佈着刺網。有人去求見的，更非經他宅裏的賬房先生，像鞠訊口供那麽的問得詳盡無遺不可。就是我那朋友，雖然在他家敎讀了已有二年餘，還沒見到東翁的十次面呢。</p>
<p>咳，這種生活，我想也不見得是怎麽够味的了。</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>橫濱博覽會瑣聞（下）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>滿洲館和朝鮮的物產，都製標本陳列出來。棉花大豆人參煤鐵，每年產額都要在幾百萬以上。因交通不便，出品很少。暹邏館內有蛇皮牛角，和各種米穀。穀形細長，和我國不同，常大宗輸人日本。銀器彫刻，有埃及古風，非日本所及。</p>
<p>北海道產熊和木材，八雲地方的農民，就用褐色的木塊彫刻熊像，每個有貴至十五元者。不論書鎭，書夾，文具，都附熊像，於是熊之刻彫已成爲他們專門的鄕土美術。奈良泥像是十分有名的，全出人工，不用機器。所製日本女子人像，精美異常，所塗色彩，鮮艷精細，已在無錫惠山之上。有白樂天像，岸然道貌，彫塑至精，但定價十五元，中國已沒有這樣高貴的泥像。</p>
<p>日本木工較我國發達，一片木頭，能做各種用具。北海道木材標本館的牆壁，是用薄片編成斜形的格子，十分有趣。日本建築平屋十分便捷，木架豎好，用蘆廉　壁，塗些泥灰。再貼幾　紙頭，舖了蓆子，不到兩天，很漂亮的房就蓋成了。博覽會的房子，都是此種，所以一方面還在添建，一方面已有破壞的地方了。　利用廢物，减輕成本，式樣摩登，合人心理，這幾點是日本工藝品暢銷的唯一原因。譬如西裝袖口，水晶，琥珀，玳瑁，寶石，眞珠均有。都用合金鑲成，所以每件僅二三元。尙有人造的僅二三角一件，可以冒充眞品。玻璃器的顏色花紋，亦精美異常。因爲他們各種東西，都有賽會，所以無不窮思極想，以冀戰勝人家。</p>
<p>女子在日本社會中，地位不高。但是因爲性情溫柔，辦事精細，所以大公司職員，吃食店侍者，交通機關買賣都僱女子。展覽會裏女子職員更佔多數，所以現在日本的職業界，女子已有取男子而代之的現象。加之日本家務都由女子擔任，伊們除了在家勞作，還要出外購買一切什物。博覽會裏女性的觀客，也較男子爲多。我們曾戲稱現代的日本，是女子的世界。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市受金融打擊　浮多痛斬……市面狂瀉</h3>
<p>紗巿盤旋已久、今則　然　疲、且跌風大熾、實因報載永興錢莊業已停業、據巿塲消息、尙有他莊牽動、於是浮言蠭起、人心大爲惶惑、一般浮多威脅斬結、巿盤乃呈狂瀉之勢、壯種驚慌之狀、完全受金融之打擊也、除本月份各月期直破八十元大關口矣、</p>

<h3>現代名家演詞</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「言語」是孔門四科之一，牠和「德行」「政事」「文學」並列，可見孔子是把「言語」作爲很重要的一科了。原來春秋戰國時代，是言語的藝術已經達到很高的一個時代，只要你讀過左傳國語戰國策等書，就會知道在這個時代裏，不但各國的使臣，所謂「行人之官」，以及游說之士，所謂「縱橫家」，他們都要講究「言語」，其餘的人又何嘗不會說話？他如記載孔孟言行的論語孟子，記載墨瞿言行的墨子，以及晚出的禮記擅弓，其中記戰許多問答辯論談講的話，雖像傳道說敎的語錄，可是很有文采，不失爲古代優美的文學。自然，我們也知道古人相信「言之不文，行之不遠，」雖是當時「言語」的記載，免不了有修飾潤色的地方，然而孔門把「言語」和「文學分開，當時」言語一自成一種學問，我們總不能不承認了。</p>
<p>唐宋以來的高僧語錄，大儒語錄，都是傳道敎的話，所重不在「言語」，更不在「文學」不過他們似乎已經感覺「文以明道」並不能明，「文以載道」並不能載，只好改用口語。他們把講學的話，把和師友問答辯論的話，都用口語記下來，當然比用古文明自，眞實。但論起文學的價値來，除了作爲口語行文的嘗試，本身實在沒有幾多文學的意味。所以從來的目錄學家總把語錄列在「子」類，作爲哲學的書：不會把牠放在集類，作爲文學的書。我們知道在古代希臘羅馬，如狄摩桑士Demosthenes西塞羅Cfcero的演說，早就成爲文學中之一類：但在中國，圖書目錄上關於文學的一個部門裏有演說一類，就不能不說是最近的事了。</p>
<p>現在，我來編輯這部名家演詞選，除了梁任公先生已經逝世以外，其餘的人都很健康的生存。計錄十二篇，作者爲章太炎梁任公到杜威十一家。只有杜威先生爲外國人，錄了兩篇。最早的一篇是恰在三十年前章太炎先生的演說錄。章先生於一九零三年（淸光緒二十九年）因上海蘇報倡言「排滿」「革命」案入獄，在獄三年，一九零五年六月二十九日出獄，卽東渡日本，這是他在留日同志歡迎會上的演詞，刋在那時民黨的機關雜誌民報第陸號，章先生自述生平的歷史，這是極可珍貴的材料。最近的一篇，是蔣夢麟先生的我們怎樣求學？這是蔣先生在天津靑年會廣播電台演詞，刊在今年二月間的天津大公報，還沒有他書把牠輯錄過。在這十一家中，有的是國學家或文學家，有的是哲學家或敎育家，有的是革命家，有的是科學家。他們的演詞，有說到怎樣做人的，有說到怎樣做革命家的，也有說到怎樣做文學家的，還有說到怎樣做科學家的。有的說到怎樣努力讀書，怎樣做學問上的修養；有的說到怎樣砥礪道德，怎樣做人格上的修養。他們的術業有專攻，思想見解也不一致，可是積極向上，努力求進步，却是一致的。我把他們的演詞輯錄一起，作爲靑年朋友的一種讀物，於學行的修養上或者不無小補罷。</p>
<p>自然，在這樣的一部小書裏，收羅不盡國內一切名流的演詞，何况有些號爲名流的，未必都有什麽精彩的演詞可錄。至於外國名流學者來到中國講演的，還有羅素杜里舒幾個人，這裏却只選錄了杜威一人的演詞，因爲他的思想學說，不像羅素的數理邏輯，杜里舒的生機哲學那麽難懂。可是我得聲明一下，十年以來，因爲中國思想界的進步，杜威的實騐主義已在中國漸漸失去牠在「五四」時代的權威了。</p>
<p>這裏選錄杜威的兩次講演，一題道德與人類本性，一題情緒在道德上之地位。他提倡積極向上的道德，反對消極的束縛本能；主張養成正確的思想觀念，引起發揚踔厲的情緒。目前中國，我們靑年大部分不是閹然媚世，便是志氣頹喪，糊糊塗塗。杜威先生所說那種做人的道理，還有够得我們一顧的價値。比如他說：</p>
<p>現在世界最可痛恨的是什麼？就是這種非積極而爲消極的道義德行。所以今日所謂良民，就是庸言庸行的鄕愿，不是那有創造能力，積極精神，森轟烈烈去改造世界的人物，這不是很可痛恨的事嗎？</p>
<p>我讀了他這段話，不覺愧汗欲出，深自痛恨。又如他說：</p>
<p>情緒能激動我們，啓發我們，束縛馳驟我們，我們不能不跟他走。情緒如希望·憤惡·喜·怒·愛·欲·等，對於人生添上多少色彩，增加多少生趣熱力，要是沒有他，何等的無生氣！即使有理智，能知能行，也像機械造物，算機加數，成不喜，敗不憂，索然沒趣了。所以人生有興趣，有價値，因爲有情緒，不然，就生也像死了。</p>
<p>目前在我們靑年中間，有許多只是媚世取容，毫無生氣的鄕愿。可是我們不能不希望靑年朋友都肯「做那有創造能力，積極精神，轟轟烈烈去改造世界的人物。」杜威先生的這種新道德學說，還不够做我們靑年的一種藥石嗎？這就是我編這部演詞選，要把杜威先生的兩篇殿後的一個理由了。</p>
<h3>跳舞馬拉松（二）</h3>
<p>— （美國LI法來耳作）宜閑譯</p>
<p>他又學會了一件事情，就是怎樣跳舞得跟美國人一樣。他有一個朋友是希臘和美國的混合種。這個朋友帶了他到西麥迭生街一家名呌「跳舞會」（Taxcance）的跳舞學校去，他繳了一塊洋錢，得到十張票，每張票可以跳一分鐘到一分半鐘。這地方個個女郎都願意跟他跳舞，因爲每分鐘她有五分的收入，他手裏的票馬上用完了，他再買幾張。他會不會跳舞沒有什麽關係，女郎們是喜歡敎他的。他常期上跳舞會去，每趟化　塊，四塊，或是五塊洋錢，不時有女郎問他，肯不肯送她回家去，再化上幾塊錢，還可得些別的好處。自從他定期的上跳們會之後，他愈加積不起錢來。</p>
<p>太克司有一次用他的儲蓄買了一套衣服，那褲子是大脚管的。他留起了短髮，把頭髮搽了油膏，當中分開來。他這才像是一僩闊少了。他留心着美國闊少們所講的各種話。於是他到公共的跳舞塲去，這些跳舞塲只收一些入場費，可以跳舞得長久。那兒常有着大羣的女郎、美貌的美國女郎，有幾個又長又美麗，奶色的皮膚，櫻桃似的紅嘴脣。他要她們跳舞。她們往往就跟他跳舞一次。可是他攀談，起來，她們就注意着他的口吻，如果他要她們再跳舞一次，她們就對他告歉，說是下次跳舞有人約定了。因此他在那兒跳舞，往往只得搭着那些稱做壁上花」（Wall　llowcrs）的風騷的醜女郎。於是他又回到跳舞會去，那邊是一角錢跳一次，所有的女郎都肯跟他跳舞的。</p>
<p>一天，大克司二十五歲了。他那希臘山間的故鄕，在他的記憶裏，只剩着一點糢糢糊糊的影子。他在美國已經住了十二年，他每天在酒排間工作十小時，每星期有十塊錢的工錢，喑中還有每星期三五塊的外快。他想發財了。他想等到自己開着酒排間或是菜館，做了富人的時候，帶着美國老婆回希臘去，像大老闆似的擺一番闊。他銀行裏存着三十五元，可以當作發這麼大財的底子的。</p>
<h3>貸欵</h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>「棉花貸」發憑證的那一天，從淸晨到薄暮，人是忙得連吃杯茶的暇逸都沒有，四鄉來的農民，團團地圍滿了初級小學校。鬧洋洋地像是有集會。</p>
<p>我的身前身後是包圍着自己人，他們接收過許可證在我手底下換貸欵證，農民一批一批地進來，一批一批地出去，他們環繞着我們，這其間，是用學生們的桌椅做了一圈臨時櫃台分隔着。</p>
<p>自從我在大門外刷牙時，天色微明，新月掛天，地上面還有黑影，那時候，已經有趕早來的農民在靜候着了。這以後隨着鷄鳴，人來如潮擁，除了三間敎室改作的招待室內，坐得滿滿地之外，小操塲裏也像是開廟會，人擠着人，遙向換證處探頭。亂雜雜地吵噪，計議着。</p>
<p>「進口」出口　都塞滿了人，出入都感困難。自衛團團丁雖然拿着棍子開路，仍然是無效。我看這秩序將要不可收拾，便請一位大喉嚨喊道：</p>
<p>「諸位不准再擠，再擠，今天我門不發領錢條了。」</p>
<p>這句話是有力量的，沒有一個人披星戴月的趕來，不是爲了那每畝二元的貸欵的。爲了錢他們的緊張情况便和緩了，我們便把出入口打通，讓人們一個一個的進來，一個一個的出去。</p>
<p>在太陽初現時候，我的筆頭便在不停的動，一直到了十二點的鐘嚮還不能停，爲了窗外面黑壓壓在靜候着的一羣，良心是不允許我休息，我不能使社員們早晨來了等到天黑走。</p>
<p>「……」社員們安靜地換了證出去。</p>
<p>我的頭腦比在烈日下曝曬着還眩暈，眼睛發着黑，看着手寫出的字都好像生了腿。同時手腕子也有點酸楚起來，在我們這羣負責人中，現在還沒一個人表示倦怠的，我沒有勇氣提議休息。</p>
<p>工作又繼續了一個鐘頭。工作人交替着，我仍在寫。</p>
<p>「焦村孫大德……二畝半地，……大棉花只有一畝半地……」</p>
<p>聽到騐證人這樣喊着，我突覺得微微有點刺激，我憶及前三天，一個半老的女人到我家來送了一份禮，說是請對孫大德的名下抬一高抬手的話，說完了，拋下禮物便走了。</p>
<p>我的精神恢復了，注視了那櫃台外，瘦小的，有幾根枯黃老鼠鬚的男人，那人的頭底着。</p>
<p>「你是孫大德？……」</p>
<p>「唔—唔—」他彷彿是知道我爲什麽特別注意他的樣子，却又像有些不好意思有話說不出。</p>
<p>「你只能拿到三元了，你那二十個鷄蛋回頭呌你女人拿回去，—公事公辦——」我說。</p>
<p>「唔！唔」</p>
<p>我在一張印就的憑單上寫了「三」字，這個瘦小的老實人，接到憑單，便謹愼地收藏在懷裏走出去，又有點戰慄的回頭看了我一眼</p>
<p>賄賂事情在鄉下一樣是多的……</p>
<p>這樣一直弄到薄暮，人是越來越少。我才借機到門外要一客飯來吃。這小鈸上的茶店裏人是滿滿的，今天是大發利市。那夥計對我說：</p>
<p>「明天還貸欵嗎？先生！」</p>
<h3>晨登觀象山</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>—靑島印象之一—</p>
<p>觀象山是擁着觀象台和一些小松樹，踞立在市中心區的。</p>
<p>一登上去，週遭無數的紅屋頂和三面環着藍色海灣的靑島，便在早上鮮美的陽光中，淸淸朗朗地裏露出來，立刻給人一個完全歐洲風味的感覺。</p>
<p>西邊海面不知是受了風的影饗，還是爲早上的氣候所致，現出灰藍和灰白兩種不同的顏色。灰白的地方，相天邊的姿態相混，合而爲一，褐色的帆船，航行其上，簡直像掛在空中似的，使人勾起了海市蜃樓的幻夢</p>
<p>南面海灣上，挨近海軍棧橋的地方，現出一隻灰色的外國小軍艦，宛如一條伺人而噬的虎狼，　然地躺在那裏</p>
<p>洋化的都巿，靜靜地　在足卜，一個頗有福氣的西　少爺似的止　　貧　夜來的睡眠。</p>
<p>山東原野裏辛苦了整夜的膠濟列車，大約對此感到不平了吧，還在遠處沿着北面山脚的海邊上，就開始轟轟隆隆地，發出咆哮的怒吼。</p>
<p>鐵路旁邊，大港小港那裏的輪船，許是表同情了，也在助威似的，來個一聲兩聲的吶喊。</p>
<p>天主敎使用着雙塔的雄姿，將一切建築鈸壓在足下那麼似的凌空立着，好像在竭力表示自己的尊嚴，不受任何的驚擾一般。</p>
<p>國民大橋邊，却遙遙立着的兩個高烟囪，如同敎堂門外的流氓一樣，帶着輕視一切的神氣，張着嘴巴，對天吐着嘲笑的黑烟？</p>
<p>日頭高了，市聲漸漸宏大起來，便慢慢走下山去</p>
<h3>景色</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>不能藏起的內部的景色，</p>
<p>打太陽系里跌到人們底腦袋上。</p>
<p>殘謝了，那朶瑣碎的花。</p>
<p>靈魂表示着滿足。</p>
<p>海岸邊有一棹難溶解的船在搖擺。</p>
<p>隱秘的下邊有溫良的美，</p>
<p>倘若我能穿上一伴金衣，</p>
<p>用不到時問，</p>
<p>我會立在她底朱顏之上。</p>
<p>把她挾在懷中奮力奔跑，</p>
<p>用不到時間·用不到光綫。</p>
<p>她拼命掙脫，我拼命奔跑。</p>
<p>距離郝凸出的海岸邊不遠了，</p>
<p>她已精細的睡熟，我也停了步子。</p>
<h3>山中牧歌（二）</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>「呌呌，那倒不要緊，又不蝕本！…出門人總是濂和一點好些。」</p>
<p>「坐在舖子上不說了，在這裏大模大樣的，嚇老鴉麽？我就不愛呌的，這樣的人，吃飯要坐上八位，息店要佔好床舖，簡直有點有點…」</p>
<p>老陳還沒有找着適當的話，就聽見秦老板在後頭嘆聲嘆氣起來，便沒說出來了。</p>
<p>「這是啥子草鞋呀？就像長了嘴巴！咳簡直要咬人了，……」</p>
<p>老徐聽見秦老板的埋怨聲音，便向老陳說道：</p>
<p>「算了吧，你聽，他的足一定打脫皮了…再不等他息息，他會看出來的，大家都是出門人，總是留點情面，好些。我們是犯不着得罪人的！」</p>
<p>「怎麽？你挑不起了麼？」老陳掉回頭來，冷冷地逼問着，「你走不動了，那就息息好了！」</p>
<p>「哪裏？這算什麽？我是說等等他好些，犯不着……」</p>
<p>「你怕得罪他麽？你只管跟我走好了，由我來對付他。」接着老陳便大聲地向秦老板喊道：「唩，泰老板足走痛了麽？這一節山路息不得呀，你曉嗎馬？唉，今天要看大家運氣了。……」</p>
<p>在道樣整大都不大容易看見人家的山中走路，即使是明知沒有什麽危險，但是，倘如有人忽然提到應該留神的話，那末，也會禁不住要胆怯起來。因爲中國邊地的山道，總是常常變生莫測的。所以，秦老板雖然用懷疑的口吻回答我看不大見得吧！」但也不知不覺地加快足步起來，不再想出各種法子來叫大家休息了。</p>
<p>老陳回過頭來看見這個矮个兒一拐一搖的狼狽樣子，便一面櫃續走着，一面開心地獨自笑了。</p>
<p>這三個人都是在路上無意中碰在一塊的，因爲狐獨的寂寞和出門人愛隨便同陌生人搖話的習慣，便在用旱烟互相借火的情形之下，起始一個問「請敎，貴姓？」一個回答「不敢，包耳陳。一就接着談起天氣生意和某一街上那家酒店的盛况來了，於是，由傍人看來也彷彿是約着趕路的夥伴一樣。不過，這須得穿着相同，彼此包袱的重量，和價値，亦還相差不遠，否則，依然還是打不攏堆的。像秦老板之和老陳仙們隔核，就正是在比較上，衣衫太周正一點。更使用尖銳的眼光把老陳和老徐從頭深深地看了一下之後，才冷冷地回答他們的招呼，並且當老陳啣着孕煙管向他借大，他只唔地從鼻孔裏哼了一聲，就把他的旱烟管翹起，好像極不耐煩似的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>姓名權</h3>
<p>— 戈</p>
<p>報載來允惠律師代表楊秀瓊女士聲明姓名權啟事，謂本人研究體育，練習游泳，原屬靑年分內之事，乃有編印書籍，籍本人姓名以為號召者，殊屬不合民法第十九條規定姓名權云云。</p>
<p>楊秀瓊以參加遠東運動會而名著，被稱美人魚，曾重金請駕南昌表演，到上海來，更因觀衆擁擠，以致不能下水等事發生。是中國運動史上不可多得的游泳人材。</p>
<p>但是她發表一次談話之後，就悄悄回廣州去了，當時有人說被稱「美人魚」是侮辱女性，這三字或者要殺害了她的前途。其實「美人魚」之由來，或許不是故意輕薄。然而楊秀瓊是位「女士」、所以自有談談婚姻問題而發生無稽的誹謗了。</p>
<p>現在報上的聲明是編印書籍者以伊名號召，諒來是什麼運動書籍，可是作者沒有見到，未知惡意抑是善意？就事論事，是書賈以楊秀瓊的名字作生意眼了。又因沒有翻過民法第十九規定姓名權是若何情形。侵害到如何程度方能請求法院除去其侵害並得損害賠償？曾記得某織造廠以楊女士游泳時的玉照在廣吿上大擂大鼓他們游泳衣之比衆不同，彷彿楊女士更有親筆題字：雖然是「同意」和「不同意」之分，然而跡近「侵害」，大同小異，無多分別也。</p>
<p>這是偶然想起的話，並不責楊女士之薄此而厚彼，或者現在號召的書籍確是使人不能已於言者。但是進一步講，現社會的人是不能「出名」的，稍稍出色的人物早就被人視為利用的工具了，花柳醫生及野雞學校的廣吿，都是拉上一大堆挺挺括括的紅人、其間送一封油印信去徵求過同意的是百不得一。（同意與否自然還是個問題）楊女士返粵時云「以求深造」，那卽使人家藉之號召，只要並不存心「侵害」，有何關係，登了廣吿，或許反舊案重提作為許多人的談話資料了，使想想寫「人言可畏」的血淋淋底絕命書的死人，那姓名是怎樣被人「侵害」着！嗚呼！</p>
<h3>生活在冷漠中的時候</h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>我不會忘記的：當有一個時侯，生活的難以控制的急行列車在人底「一千個留神中的一個不小心」中衝到了無人的荒漠中去，衝進了冷酷而且無窮盡長的地下陲道裏去，於是，從過去的戚受的經騐上，我知道：前面準會有一個星月無光的走不完的長夜在等着我，前面的天氣是又將如北國之嚴冰的冷酷了。</p>
<p>沉沉的夜晚落下來的時侯，我會看不見人，也看不見自己的；一種恐怖與猜忌的想頭便永不會忘掉似地，熟悉得像走回自己的故居似的，毫不遲疑地走來訪到了被我所密藏着的一顆疲乏的心；而接着，便又毫不顧惜地，連連地用冷酷的聲音叩響了它，像蛇，像閃電。</p>
<p>結果是：這不愉快的呌人發抖的意念的來客，便粗野地把人底心臟奪去了。一種冷氣通過全身，呌我想到馳騁在北美洲的雪地的大白熊，粗野而且驕傲——是的，當生活得不很輕快，而這不很輕快的生活又落進了可怕的人世間之冷漠中去的時侯，我覺到世界離開了我；而我，在憤怒的火熖中，也許會以為良己已經不再需要這世界，與蘊藏在它中間的冷漠了，</p>
<p>難道可以說：生物的生存的本能，它本身便是一種罪惡嗎？誰又能相信呢？可是生的現象却在遠處半明半減的昭示了我們：「努力去向生存的路上走吧：生存的本能，縱然不是一種罪惡，但每一種被賦有了生存之本能的生物，却必需受到人世間的無罪的刑罰的啊！」</p>
<p>都難受嘈弄呢！但每個人都感覺到生活的急行列車所經過的地帶是沒有綺麗的風景的；相反地，列車是永遠在多風雨的氣候中顚跛着，傾跌着。而棲息在裏邊的無數的靈魂呢，却也正像被流放到荒絕區中去的囚犯，是無疑地永遠被一些人世間的冷漠與險惡的鞭子所抽打着，所刑罰着——祇能把人間的好意的熱情，毫不顧惜地，拋向外面的風雨中去了。</p>
<p>在囚籠裏也許會放大膽探出頭來看一眼的吧？但景象是呌人擔心的哪：橫在前面的是一條蜿蜒曲折的長得難以推測的狹路，而霧是不斷地在無休止的風雨中濃盛起來；於是人們全懷疑起來了：「在外界的冷漠中，也許前面便是那不可知的，作為毀滅之總淸算的世界的盡頭吧？」</p>
<p>然而，這終究是謎——霧一般的謎阿！</p>
<p>（有誰曾想到過對人間的險惡的咀咒呢？在一長串的艱難的日子中，生活得可怕且不經意的時候是常有的：於是、合着這怕人的生活的波濤，一些腐爛了的被棄的廢物與渣滓便跟着流過來了：是人的冷漠，是人的險惡，是人的相互的陷害與欺騙，是人的褐色的狡獪！）</p>
<p>彷彿像剛從一個模糊的惡夢中醒來似地，過往的苦難終於昭示了我一些若卽若離的東西了：人世間的冷漠始終像一座頑固的冰山那樣地兀立在我的面前，給生活縛住了手脚的人，要從那千仭的冷酷之絕壁中爬過去是不容易的，因為，生存的本身，據說，就是一種不可赦的罪惡；而人是必需用自己吐出的冷漠去謀害自己的呢。</p>
<p>且把這也誇作是人類的光榮吧（假如不願意說「恥辱的話），當生活落進了冷漠的時侯！</p>
<h3>海晏之行</h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>浮鬆的黃泥土層上面叢生着葱綠的蘆葦草，蔚藍色的天空反照出了海濱的淡薄和冷靜。海水的澎湃送來的響聲，永遠是一樣不變的音調，沙沙，渤渤，給人聽見也總會感到這樣冷靜的海濱有點空虛與悲哀，從海面拋盪着的火輪面瞧着可以看得很淸楚地，遼遠地展開着灣灣曲曲的海岸綫，岸邊的岩石給水浪打擊而反響出來的聲音和銀白色的浪花，老遠是一樣的，一種幽幽的悲凉。</p>
<p>帶着倥惚的流浪人的憂鬱的步調，從都市裏跳出來跟着洶湧的海浪的潮流又悄悄地飄泊到海濱的村莊來。——好像我的命運刻下來是個流浪的痛苦的人一樣，從小孩子到了年靑時沒有停息地度着不安定的生活，然而，反正，我希望在那麼黯黑的旅程上找尋出我所渴望着的奇蹟來。是呵！那沒有虛偽的都市裏的一樣可怕的猙獰的臉孔與殘酷的剝掠的鞭子的農村裏，尤其是還帶着原始的氣息的海濱上——我是那麽渴望着」在這樣的地方，找尋出我的想念着的人間的幸福來。可是，這是夢想嗎？等到事情上給予我一個更實切的明顯的體明的時候，我感到，不但靜穆的農村裏已給現代的都市裏一樣罪惡者來蹂躪得那麼冷酷與悲凉，而且，還帶着原始的氣息的遼遠的淸靜的海濱上也已明顯地啟示出到處已捲起了時代的風雲了——呵我是幻想着嗎？——未曾有怎麼的經騐的年輕人是一樣熱情的，渴望着，然而，等到事實上給予一個失望與冷颯的時候，他總會想到這社會裏到處地有着時代的罪惡的鞭子佔有着的。</p>
<p>離開了海行生活，兩條腿跨上了十八世紀的一個小市鎭同時又是一個廣大的村莊的海晏街。從繞着蘆葦草的河溪中掉着的小艇上可以看到那是一個香港型的小島似的矗立着，高的山峯有着不新不舊的樓房，塔一般的碉樓，一個純樸的影子就掠透了旅人的心懷，我就祈望着在這樣的海濱的市鎭上得到我的經騐，得到人問的一切的原形來。</p>

<p>起初，我就跟朋友在一切的特異的景色間流浪，我不忘記了我所需要的一部分是靜穆而美麗的風景，那時是初春，從老遠的印度洋上飄到南海來的溫柔的風像媚惑着旅人的心胸一樣地在盪漾着。那海風好像完全沒有特異的氣息似地，只是感到春天的美麗和可怕，然而，我踏過靑的山，盪過綠的海水，依然找不出我所渴望着想望來。只是，看到的都是蘊藏着多年前的戰爭的殘痕——又像悲哀的箭子，掠過我的心胸，那麽淡淡而凄凉的。</p>
<p>不久，當我感到海晏是那麽乏味而且已蹈進時代的悲哀的圈子裏的時候，我又在海面開始飄盪到別個地方去，依然是那麽靜悄悄的呵！</p>
<h3>鄕下的聞人</h3>
<p>— 二郞</p>
<p>「你說的是羲和先麼？我認得他，我認得他，熟人呢。」</p>
<p>來客大呌一聲，之後，就將羲和先的近况如說故事一樣地說下去了。</p>
<p>「在我們的鎭上，羲和先是最有風趣而且是一個博學的人。他雖然是一個醫生，可是，他是「半途出家」的儒醫，以前，聽說他還是一個秀才呢。一個秀才，在我們鎭上，已經够給人奪敬的了，何况他這秀才又博學？醫生是博學的而又是秀才，羲和先便給鎭上的人奉爲聖賢了。當他出診的時候，在路上走着，人們誰都合他招呼，有的呌道，「秀才那裏去？」有的呌道，「先生看病去？」都是對他表示着尊敬的。他人亦很和氣，對於向他招呼的人，無論是老人，無論是婦女，他總是笑嬉嬉地回答道，「看病去。」或者「是的，看病去。」可是，當他經過酒店的時候，酒店老板那張老頭兒却朝他先擠眉弄眼，幷以手勢暗問他：「喝一杯吧？」然後開口說道，「喝一杯，再走，不要緊，錢記在水牌上好了。」因爲　和先一碰到張老頭兒的招呼，總是說，「沒有帶錢呢」。</p>
<p>「羲和先！是我們靑年人呌他的！他旣然喜歡喝一杯半杯，亦就難怪酒店老板張老頭兒要招他的生意，而羲和先却並不是會喝酒的人，只喝一杯半杯，大頭尖類有如葫蘆的臉上便飛紅起來，用袖子揩一下嘴巴設道，「醉了，醉了」！有的時候就這樣地走了。有的時候却並不想走，而在酒店裏談天說地起來。他是一個博學的人，除了酒店老板張老頭兒，簡直沒有一個人够資格合他談話。　　　　　　　　亦是一個博學的人，聽說一部「三國演義」他能够從頭背到尾，眞是丁不得。兩個博學的人一碰在一起，少不得要爭論。有一次，就爲了爭論，三國演義裏頭的曹操是不是壞蛋這問題，甚至於翻了臉；有好幾天羲和先不上酒店去喝酒，張老頭兒亦並不招呼他喝一杯。當時，義和先是爭着曹換是了不得的人物，張老頭兒却爭着曹操是一個大壞蛋。起初還是據理力爭，後來，羲和先睜起眼睛狠狠地將指頭伸到張老頭兒的鼻尖上喝道，「你懂得個屁，曹操會做詩，劉備會不會」：張老頭兒亦不示弱，拍着桌子說道：「曹操是一個奸雄，劉備是一個仁主，會做詩有什麽用，孔明怎不未投曹操却投了劉備一？羲和先想了一想，理由爭不過，他老羞成怒，氣煞了，大喝道：「你懂得個屁，你懂得個屁」！張老頭兒被罵得亦氣煞了，說道：「你才懂得個屁，你才懂得個屁」！兩人就這樣翻臉了。羲和先有好幾天好像合張老頭兒絕了交。</p>
<p>「現在他的鬍子白了，而且張老頭兒已經死了，他雖然照常到酒店去喝酒，却沒人合他爭論什麽了」。</p>
<h3>巷</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>從天亮起，這巷內便充滿着嘈雜的聲音。菜蔬的呌賣，兒童的嬉戲，鄰舍之無謂的爭吵，送報人的車鈴，混和起來在空中糾成一片喧囂，若是到了自畫呢，一切聲音就更嘈雜了些，甚至到夜深人靜的時侯，也常常可以聽到夜行人的步履聲，敲門聲，這麽一條巷便終日終夜地奏着那討厭而俗鄙的樂曲。而我對於這樂曲，是深深地厭煩着。</p>
<p>在厭煩中，有兩個巷的印象闖進我的意識來了。</p>
<p>第一個巷是在北平，一個住了幾年的令人迴戀的地方。住的巷是深長的一條，家家朱漆的大門和門首蒼翠的樹構成極美的對映。春天的時候，滿巷都飄落若槐花，有些烏雀來啄那樹梢的葉子，一切都充滿了那麼一稱中世紀風的安閑空氣。小販不是沒有，可是那呌賣就恍如一片雅樂。早起的杏仁茶，深夜的硬麵條餑，夏天的冰盞。初秋的甜葡萄和棗子，乃至一個剃頭担子，一個收舊貨人，他們的聲音都溫雅而饒有詩意。早起起，有蝸牛樣的水車從巷裏走過，給人留下需用的水。畫間有些車馬走過，到黄昏便完全平靜了。於是，我們便可勾留在院內，享受那千金不換的幸福時走，看　角去饅慢落下去，看歸巢的烏鴉黑漆漆地飛個漫天，看蝙蝠了，夜就在不知不覺中來剷了，這樣過一天，連晚上睡覺都是安適的，做夢都是輕鬆的。</p>
<p>我是不能忘記那巷，不能忘記那巷的啊！</p>
<p>另一個巷。在蘇州，一個擁着天堂名號的滿溢着詩意的城郭裏，有一條曾為我住過的巷。雖沒有什麽水鄉的風味，但那幽靜是至今還吸引着我夢魂的。種着樹，滿巷都是綠陰地下的石板有一半是潮潤潤的，關在門內終日不聞一點喧囂，除了風吹過葉子低語的聲，和從對面院落內傳來的人聲，院內種着桃花，石榴花，鳳仙，一切都像古代詩詞中所吟咏的那種「晝境」，白天可以聽到的有人力車拖過門外，有低次的呌賣聲，一到黄昏，便都像中了魔般地靜下來了，於是我們可以聽到鄰舍上門板窗板的砑砑聲，聽到那黑越越的巷內一個賣卜人敲着小銅鑼走路的聲，聽到後面一家的一個老居士擊着淸脆的磬和木魚在誦經的聲，慢慢這些都消逝了，擺在我們前面的乃是一個長長的溫靜可愛的黑衣。而我們也沉入睡眠。</p>
<p>到第二天呢，則照這麼再來上一遍，是熟悉的，但不是單調的。我愛那巷，我更愛那巷裏的人和他們的生活！</p>
<p>這麽和我生過關係的兩條詩意的巷子，往往在我煩擾的時候光顧到我幻想中來。我沒法過這嘈雜喧囂的日子，在都巿裏，也曾一度倒各方去探訪那類似的巷子，可是得到的只有失望。在靜安寺路附近，有一條呌做Lovw　Lane的，名字很迷人，靜，有透着燈光的窗紗和從專面流出的琴聲，樹蔭在路燈下緩緩擺動，但那始終是太「都會」的了，太「現代」的了。所以那地方我沒有作個再度的訪問。</p>
<p>我只是在懷念着那兩個巷，而且是一種半悵惘半甜蜜的懷念呢呢！</p>

<h3>雷門諾伐羅脫離米高梅之內容</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>好萊塢的許多男明星，我們所喜觀看的，雷門諾伐羅卽使不能算做第一把交椅，亦可以說是數一數二的了。因此，關乎他最近的一些新聞，尤其是他被傳說着要脫離銀幕的時候，一定是大家所急於要知道的。</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅從此不再拍影片了嗎？他的榮名和他的爲榮名而奮鬥，難道已經戳破了他的銀夢了嗎？他有什麽將來的計劃？他現在的生活如何？這些都是我們所要問的。</p>
<p>他在好萊塢已經接連紅了十三年之久。他是一位美少年，千萬人所崇拜的銀慕大情人。世界的理想家，都將他奉爲男子圭臬。但是最近他好像出了什麽毛病似的，他票房的收入漸漸跌落了下來，他的影片已經缺少了動人的魔力。及到最近，本年開始的時候，他忽然和米高梅公司，他十餘年來的老東家，宣布脫離了關係。當時米高梅在攝完了“The　Night　Is　Young”之後，正想再拍一張歌舞鉅片，但是雷門卻向公司當局請求解除他的職務，公司方面因爲他情詞懇摯，不得不答應了。於是他就跳出了這銀色的電影圈。但是因此一來，外間的謠言，亦就因此蓬勃而生了。</p>
<p>最近一位新聞記者，因爲他是雷門的老朋友，特地跑到他家要去訪問他，問他到底是怎麼回事？但是雷門諾伐羅卻毫無疑義的說道：「什麼？脫離電影？當然不會的。我要是有些知識的話，决不會的。我亦不至於停止作事的。失去了我的野心？一個人失去了野心，他就是半死的人了，但是……在最近期中，我想不再拍什麼片子，因爲最近所拍的片子，那種故事，眞使我厭倦了。我覺得我的影戲事業，有一個極大的毛病。你知道是什麼？就是沒有進步。多少年以來，我一些進步沒有。在最近五年之中，我沒有做過什麽我所應當做的事。」</p>
<p>不錯的，雷門諾伐羅的話是旣誠實而透澈。他是一些沒有自欺欺人的習氣的。他又說道：「一個人的藝術，亦應當跟着他的年齡改進的。我已是成年的人了。我不願意永遠地住在昨日之中。我不願意將同樣的故事，輸逥的搬演着。維也納的羅曼斯哩，足球的故事哩。我的脫離米高梅，是友善的脫離，但那就是我的理由。同樣的題材，一再的重演，有什麼好處呢？『</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅在合同束縛之下，是沒有自己選擇故事之救的，於是他就不得不暫時宣吿脫離一下。他說：「我對於十年以前的一切問題，已經不覺得什麼興味了。雖然以我的相貌，儘可以扮演比我實在年齡幼小的角色，但我的心情，已經不是十年以前的心情了。在“The　Night　Is　Young”之中，我是飾着一位二十五歲的少年，但是在我極力的扮演之中，我所能做到的，至多是模倣我過去的作風而已。因此，我就自己問著自己：『難道這是可以永久的嗎？』</p>
<p>「就是這樣做下去，亦不是一件容易的事。永久的做著一位風流小生，每次自己想給一些異樣的東西給人家看，眞是再難沒有的了，我要是女子，那就不同了，因爲，你知道，女演員可以時時換換裝束，頭髮改改花樣，扮相亦可以更變的，但是一個男子……」他說著，很狡滑的擠眉弄眼的笑著。</p>
<p>雷門現在正編著一本戲，名字呌做「又一個故事」“Its　Another　Story”裏面是敘述一位電影明星，做了十多年的明星，覺得厭倦了，情願犧牲了明星的地位和收入，跳到舞台上去。這大概亦就是雷門諾伐羅的「夫子自道」，因爲他已頗有到倫敦去登台表演，暫時變換變換空氣之意也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「痴蝶情鶯」</h3>
<p>— 鏟非</p>
<p>Sweet　Adeline—國泰映</p>
<p>假使說誰能承認歌舞影片並不要充實的內容，祇要形式的華麗，那末「痴蝶情痴」是將被人們讚美着的，這是華納公司繼「四十二號街」，「歌舞昇平「，「華淸春暖」「花月爭輝」等片之後的大歌舞影片了。但是丟開內容祗從形式而估價，這决不是有理可以存在的論據。無論形式如何充分的表現黃金色很的煊耀，其給與觀衆的威應始終是無限空虛。</p>
<p>「痴蝶情鶯」也沒有脫除無原則的談情說愛的老調兒，這種老調兒已經使人們覺得煩膩而厭倦了。不會缺少的，這裏有醉人的爵士音樂，這裏有奢侈而淫麋的舞蹈，這裏有滑稽角色的噱頭，這裏有熱情的擁抱和接吻。這些這些，被認爲舊型的歌舞影片所必須具備的種種在「痴蝶情鶯中」是都已應有盡有的具備着了。然而由於內容的淺薄與庸俗，這一切奢侈與淫糜，無非是技術爛熟的藝人們掩飾空虛的堆砌，誰能在這中間體認出若干人生意味或時代的友映呢？新型歌舞片之在美國產生，到底是十分困難的事了。</p>
<p>是的這一影片對於要求表現眞實的人們，自然是不能如其願望的，但對於瘋狂享樂的軟性紳士們，卻是使他們迷醉的醇酒。譬如在酒店裏歡樂若狂的合唱，譬如鏡中映出的歌舞，又如燦爛星光之下的草茵流水，鞦韆架上的情歌……都極華麗的迎合了紳士淑女們的嗜好。誰能否認這些不是美國歌舞片高峯的表現呢？這眞是一部醉人的影片，但不免也是一部掩蔽着人生眞義的空虛影片。</p>
<p>以上，關於這一影片本身，我祇想說到這兒爲止。因爲這一影片是「亡命者」的導演馬文萊洛（Mervyn　Leroy）繼「歌舞昇平」後的作品，所以關於他，我想說到一些。同時中國觀衆，對於他曾經是期望很高的，自從「亡命者」給與人們深切印象後。</p>
<p>一般的說，電影導演和其他部門的藝術家一樣，自有着自己的世界觀，和各人不同的作風。在美國，我們至少可以舉出數人，如佛蘭克鮑才琪　（FrankBorzage）的純情主義，從「七重天」到「俊紅慘綠」，一貫的表現出來。如舍維多（King　Vidor在「鶴立雞羣」，「生活」……等作品中表現着一貫的人道主義和改良主義，如西席地密耳（SecilB．Demi）之作爲宗教作者而出現以及他對於歷史劇的癖好，又如劉別謙（Ernst　Labitsch）在「璇宮艷史」或「風流寡婦」中一貫的幻想與輕鬆，無一不是不保持着固有的作風。但是馬文萊洛卻和馬慕寗（Roaben　Mamoulian）卻有相似之處。馬慕寗製作傳奇的「化身博士」，也製作戀愛至上主義的「戀歌」或「瓊宮恨史」，馬文萊洛製作尖端的暴露現實的「亡命者」，也製作沒有充實內容的歌舞片「歌舞昇平」或「痴蝶情鶯」，甚至於還製作庸俗的「偵探尼萊」之類。就「歌舞昇平」來說，其中至少還挿入一塲退伍士兵的失業救濟的歌劇，若干的還接觸了現實，而這一點「痴蝶情鶯」卻連這一點都沒有做到。當然，這是劇本的限制，但是他沒有固定的作風，在他的作品不作爲自己的世界觀之表現，乃是極明顯的事實。</p>
<p>這樣說來，人們對於他，似乎不必存着過高的奢望。更從他能够成爲華納公司老闆甲克華納的乘龍一點上來說，也許他不過是一個以營業爲至高目的市會作家而已。</p>

<h3>雲天恨塞（Living　on　Velvet）（三）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>脫官抬起頭來，仰視著天空，若有斯思的說道：「我自己亦不知道。那裏其其之中，或者有樣東西……它曾經想要我的生命，而沒有成功。我不過想再給它一個機會而已。」一回兒他們已經來到華德的家裏。脫雷正在剃著鬍子，華德閒站在一旁和他談著話。脫雷忽然停住了，舉起了剃刀問華德道：「你叫我剃鬍子，到底是爲什麻麼！」華德道：「我們到一個宴會去呀。」</p>
<p>脫雷道：「誰的宴會呢？」華德道：「愛梅柏倫梯斯的宴會。她和她的姑母瑪莎柏倫梯斯同住。她的姑母　怕會不贊成你的行爲的。」脫雷又問道：「愛梅柏倫梯斯是誰呢？」華德遲疑了一下，然後說道。。「她或者會嫁給我的。我深深地愛著她，而她呢……卻愛我不到一半。」脫雷一面打着肥皂，一面繼續問道：「她是什麼樣子的人呢？」華德ｇ　本正經似的說道：「大概四十五歲……體重有些超過二百磅……她的眼睛是藍色的……我說的是好的一隻……皮色是斑斑點點的。」脫雷挿嘴道：「簡而言之，再好沒有了。」華德道：「不錯。她很美麗，可愛，有禮貌，而極聰明……」他們說完了，就相視大笑起來。</p>
<p>到了晚上，華德帶了脫雷到愛梅柏倫梯斯的家裏。脫雷覺得大家都在瞪著眼看他，因爲大家讀了晚報上的記載，而晚報所講的空軍演習之事，一大半是描寫這位狂妄的不速之客的。但是脫雷卻一些不覺得不自在。後來他遇見了一位女郎，她黑黑的頭髮，白嫩的皮膚，於是他更不在乎人家的注意他了。</p>
<p>脫雷亦不知道那位女郎是誰。他們二人好像邂逅相遇了，不知不覺的就跳起舞來。他覺得她用的香水很可愛，還有她那撇著嘴的笑，和帶著笨軍的喉音。他亦沒有想到，這位女郎亦許就是愛梅。他對於那天下午華德和他講的話，竟完全忘懷了。他祇知道現在抱在懷裏跳舞的女子，可以算是他生平所見的一般女子中，最完美的一個了。他亦管不了她到底是誰。他亦來不及去問她。</p>
<p>至於愛梅一方面呢——因爲她確是愛梅——她亦一時的爲他那種粗獷漠落的態度所誘惑了。等到音樂停止了，他們二人正在草地的門口。晚雷不知不覺的，就帶了她走了出來。他們很奇怪的，好像巳經是老朋友，不用請教姓名，連談話都用不著似的。愛梅時時聽著他的笑聲。他說的話，是沒有什麽重要性，亦沒有什麼連續性的，但是他的眼睛，卻包含着極重大的意味。脫雷忽然問道：「我們離開這裏，興不與。」愛梅連忙道：「哦，不興，不興，客人剛剛在一個一個的來。」脫雷道：「我知道，但是……請你……」愛梅好像失去了知覺似的，她竟冷不防的，等到她想着，他們二人已經坐在一輛公共汽車裏面了。（未完）</p>

<h3>最新醫院建築設計之大要（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉旣漂</p>
<p>創設醫院之責任，在能濟世活人，當此文化日進之際。建設醫院，實為要務。惟醫院建築實為科學及應用技術之實施地，一切計劃較其它建築尤為複雜。故設計者應先有醫院設備之智識。臨時又須與富有經騐之醫院主持者。作詳細之討論，方可從事進行，否則盲人瞎馬，無以着手也。以下所述，皆最新醫院設計中之要點，茲略述如下。</p>
<p>（一）牀位之規定牀位為應病人之需要而設。欲建醫院者。須預定床位之數目。然各地之情形不同。需要因之亦異。苟就繁華都市之統計而言。每二〇〇〇戶口。應設內外科床位一個，傳染病床位一個，兒童床位一個。產科床位一個。但此種比例。每有變化。其原因有四。（一）瘟疫流行。（二）社會情形不同。（三）人口增加率之不同。（四）醫院之多寡。故要作精確統計。當先作詳細之調查焉。</p>
<p>（二）地址之選擇最重要一項。為地址之選擇。地址適當則一切易於解决。故於選擇時。當注意數項。</p>
<p>A（安靜）要離開鐵路。工塲。繁盛街道。及公共集會之所。如敎堂。學校。運動塲。市塲等。</p>
<p>B（鮮潔空氣）要避烟產惡味之處。如製造廠。車站及未修之大道。</p>
<p>C（昆虫稀少）要離開馬廐。屯貨廠。池沼及濕汚之地。</p>
<p>D（外景適當）外景須靜而不囂。雅而適意。使病人得以暢其胸懷。故以田林遠山等為天然風景為宜。</p>
<p>E（方位向陽）須選一地址，能使病室之佈置。每日至少得有一部日光。</p>
<p>F（保持永久）避免將來能變為工商業中心之地。</p>

<h3>杭州市建築近況</h3>
<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>杭州市，誰也知道是浙省的省會，並且是我國歷史上的一個都市，在全市面積縱長二三·二里，橫闊三六里下的建築事業，究竟是怎樣，我想，大家是急切的要明白呢！現在，我把杭州市最近的建築槪况，來報吿給大家知道罷！</p>
<p>一個都市的一切消長，是某於人口方面的，杭州市因歷年來人口的增加，所以其對居住上的房屋建築，是此較其他各業來得發達，我們不要把悠久時期的杭州人口來比較，就是自革命軍奠定浙省後人口來相比，不由地會令我們驚奇的，當民十六年十月的調查，全市人口·不過三八〇·〇三一人，十七年，四五一·一四七人，十八年，四七四·二二八人，而十九年時，則增加至五〇六·九三〇人，二十年五二三·五六九人，二十一年比較稍减為五二二·五二九人，二十二年時，又增加了到五二九·一六三人，而去年民二十三九月調查，巳達五四六·四三四人了，在這八年裏，人口的增加，是這樣的迅速，那末，其對建築事業的槪况，不雖明白是發達的，所以，在杭州市人口的增加，建築的需要，原是必然的事實。</p>
<p>杭州市房屋的建築，在二十二年時侯，計普通住宅建築四百六十一起，佔面積八七·七六〇·〇〇平方公尺，價一·〇六八·八三〇·〇〇元；商店二百七十一起，佔土地面積三三·一二〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値五三六·四二〇·〇〇元：廠屋五十六起，佔面積一三·二八〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値一三五·九五〇·〇〇元；公館宅舍五起，佔面積六七〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値一八·〇〇〇·〇〇元；學校六起，佔面積二·一四〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇元；娛樂塲一起，佔地一〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値四〇〇·〇〇元；其他建築六十五起，佔地六·九三〇·〇〇平方公尺，價植一一九·六七〇·〇〇元，共計建築面積達一四一·七七〇·〇〇平方公尺，營造總値一·三九六·四九三·〇〇元，而去年呢，據市府報吿，一月至十月十個月裏，建築面積達十四萬〇四百六十平方公尺，營造總値一百七十九萬五千那百元，發出執照計七百八十二起，比較前年，造價增加四十萬元左右，而分類建築的報吿，只一月至六月數額，計普通住宅二九七起，佔地五五·七三〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値五五·七六〇·〇〇元；商店一二一起，佔地二八·一〇三·〇〇平方公尺，價値二一七·七七〇·〇〇元；廠房一七起，佔地六·六五〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値七六·五五〇·〇〇元；公館宅舍二起，佔地四六〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値六·七〇〇·〇〇元；學校四起，佔地三·一二〇·〇〇〇平方公尺，價値九二·七〇〇·〇〇元；其他建築四〇起，佔地木·九四〇·〇〇平方公尺，價値八一·六七〇·〇〇元；倘使來比較二十二年上年、那末，去年上年的建築，也未嘗有怎樣的衰落和减縮，這因為人口的迅速增加，和各行政商業機關的翻造，及偉大建築，有以致之呢。同時，現代的建築，都趨於華貴方面，其營造價値的增加，當然是要比較從前加增的。我們再從市政府的徵收房捐的數額看來、頻年是祗有增加而沒有什麽减退的，十六年房捐的收入、計九八·八九五·四六元，十七年三九八·七〇三·五三元、十八年四四三，〇〇七·七二元，十九年四九七·五九三·三六元，二十年四七三·二六二·八一元，二十一年四七四·六五九·四七元，去年二十三年一月至十月收入上比較减少了不少，祇一八八，三三七·一一五元，但這並不是人口的减退，和建築的衰落，實際的還是市面太不景氣，各種工商業趨於萎凋狀態，於是閉歇的閉歇，停業的停業，以致房捐收入上，受這種的影響，而减低了，據市庫收入項的統計，佔着百分之三九·六三，乃占着首位呢！</p>
<p>同時，我們更可從工務局去年一月至十月新築馬路，計有石塔兒路，淸泰路，夕照路，國貨路，蘇堤廻車道，徐溪路，茅龍路，九溪十八潤路，四烟路，及水溪路等，共計完成路面二萬六千八百二十七平方公尺。這些馬路的新建築，便利交通是事實，但因建築事業的發達，不無促成新建馬路的主要原因之一呢！上面曾經說過，都市的一切消長，是基於人口上面的，而人口的增加，對建築事業的促進和發達，所以，杭州市的建築，在去年裏能够比前年增加營造價値，未始不是光明的佳象。事實吿訴我們，建築在現時潮流下，向前的發展，巳有了許多證據，杭州市的建築，不過是典型之一罷了。</p>
<p>其次，我們對建築事有切密關係的地產，也有知道的必要，杭州市商業中心的水漾橋，淸河坊，羊壩頭，三元坊一帶地產，在從前，每畝的地價，不通是値三四千元，到現在，因建築事業的發達，已是暴漲了十分之八九了，據最近估計，水漾橋每畝値三萬元，淸河坊羊壩頭每畝約二萬元，就是下城市塲的中心忠淸大街，鑒橋大街，每畝地價也要一萬左右了，至於城區地價，新民路一帶，在民十二時候，每畝最高價値二千餘元，現在要七八千至萬元了，至於城區以外，也同着城區及商市中心地帶一般的高漲。現在，市政府的積極建設馬路，和改良的設備，目的無非繁榮杭州市，那末，其未來的地產價値，正是方興未艾呢，也許不久便會再騰貴起來</p>
<h3>工廠建築的心理設計（下）</h3>
<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>至於工塲與工塲之間的距離，最須經濟，如果距離稍遠，那末工人來來往往浪費無益的精力太多了。</p>
<p>二、保留相當空地，以備工人休憇：疲倦是工作的毒蛇，他能使工作的效率减少至最低限度。因此歐美開明的工廠，工人在廠裏都有短期的休息，三公鐘五分鐘是不等的。</p>
<p>但是休息最要的條件，須脫離工作的塲所，使之眼目一新，心地開朗，容易回復新鮮的精神。每見我國工廠，工人休暇的時間，仍舊留在工塲裏，這是十分不合心裏的。</p>
<p>可是在都市中，地價過高，寬敞的空地，不可多得，那麽在打樣時應在工塲外面留出較闊的走廊或甬道，以供工人們的休息。</p>
<p>（三）內部設備外面的輪廓旣已全部决定，就須討論內部的設備：</p>
<p>一，採光關於採光方面，心理學家已經做過許多實騐，我們可以把他們的結果加以簡單叙述：</p>
<p>窗戶和天窗裏射進來的光綫，不宜直接對着工人的眼睛，因為這是足以分散工人的注意力。牆壁的顏色宜用淡黃，幷且不能太光滑，如此可以避免返光。晚上的燈光最好砌成暗綫。如果事實上不可能，那末電燈宜用乳白色，幷且不使直接射在工人們的眼皮上。</p>
<p>二，避聲機械所發嘈雜的聲音，最最擾亂工人工作的心緒，容易使他們疲勞，神經也容易衰弱。這是在工作上最最不經濟的事情呢！在建築的時候應當竭力設法，使室內擾亂的聲减至最低限度，那眞是功德無　的事。</p>
<p>三，通氣據紐約通氣協會的研究：公衆塲所，人數衆多，口中所吐的氣，身上輻射的熱，足使室內的氣溫儘情增高，這種室內的高溫度能使人疲乏，瞌睡，頭痛，煩惱。在工塲當中當然更甚。因為除了工人自己所發熱度，還有機械所生的熱度，因此工塲中的通氣設備，眞是刻不喀緩的呢？</p>
<p>上面所提的幾點，雖然很筒略，雖然很粗淺，但是却十分重要。建築工廠的如能一一注意，工人的福利固然增高，廠主的獲益也一定非常之大的。</p>

<h3>Koreans Smuggle Silver Dollars, Shoot and Wound Customs Officers; All Inspection Stations Seriously Investigate and Suppress; Japanese Side Agrees to Assist in Stopping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) During an inspection at the Qinhuangdao Customs Station on the 21st, patrol officers discovered a Korean man in a through train smuggling 20,000 silver dollars in leather containers. When the customs officers attempted to arrest him, the man pulled out a pistol and fired seven shots, wounding two customs officers, including Li Jingxian. Subsequently, the Japanese military police team received a notification from the customs and dispatched troops to the station, arrested the Korean man, and sent the wounded patrol officers to the hospital.

<p>(Tianjin) After negotiations with our customs, the Japanese consular branches in Yuguan, Tangshan, and Hao County issued a public notice on the 22nd stating that the Chinese authorities recently reported that Japanese and Korean residents were secretly smuggling Chinese silver dollars for export, and the customs had made arrests, which was detrimental to the relationship between the countries. In the future, it is important not to engage in smuggling. Hao Gede, the Customs Commissioner of Qinhuangdao, reached a compromise with the Japanese side. From May 1st, the Shanhaiguan Japanese Police Station will dispatch police officers and the Japanese military police team will dispatch three soldiers to assist customs officers in patrolling. Each time a train arrives at the station, they will inspect passengers for smuggling silver dollars out of the customs. Chinese people will be arrested by the customs, and Japanese and Korean people will be arrested by the Japanese military police team. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Currency Reform Committee Studies Raw Materials for Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to research by the Currency Reform Committee, since the standard coins have been uniformly minted by the mint, subsidiary coins have been gradually recovered and destroyed, which has been quite effective. However, subsidiary coins are the most complicated, and there are many types circulating in the market, with different exchange rates in different regions. Now, taking the decimal system as the standard, there are three preliminary questions: (1) Which raw material is most suitable for subsidiary coins, such as copper, zinc, nickel, etc.? It is necessary to first investigate whether the domestic production of these raw materials is abundant and does not require dependence on foreign countries. (2) The texture must be strong and durable to be suitable for minting subsidiary coins. (3) How to average the exchange rate of the original old coins in the future and find a way to recover and destroy them. Detailed research is required before a decision can be made.

<h3>After the Guantai Closure, the Main Current Goes Straight to Yang Geng Dam; The Water Is Turbulent and the Situation Is Extremely Dangerous</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After the closure of the Guantai breach, the main current goes straight to Yang Geng Dam. The water is turbulent and the situation is extremely dangerous. Jiao Hongnian and Yang Shulin, the representatives of the disaster victims from Changyuan who came to Tianjin to petition, called on Zhang Houwan, the Director of Civil Affairs, and Hu Yuanhui, the Director of Construction, on the 22nd, requesting that the River Affairs Bureau be ordered to build quickly. The Relief Association for Yellow River Disaster in Hebei telegraphed the Changyuan County Government again, stating that because the willow trees on the Yellow River embankment had been completely cut down, it was appropriate to quickly repair along the Jin and Taihang Embankments to regulate the climate, control rain, absorb water, and strengthen the embankment. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Relief Association for Yellow River Disaster in Hebei telegraphed Changyuan, stating that after the Guantai closure, the Changyuan moat embankment should be temporarily suspended. The unfinished projects should be continued by the Construction Department with allocated funds. Hereafter, disaster relief work will be handled by the Relief Association, and the construction of embankments will be the responsibility of the Construction Department. Plans for repairing bridges and roads outside Changyuan City, estimating the amount of funds, should be submitted separately to the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments for review and handling. The Hebei River Affairs Bureau has retained river affairs officials and soldiers in Guantai, including five section chiefs, eight section members, ninety-two river soldiers, and hundreds of long-term laborers. The committee ordered the Yellow River Construction and Relief Team to retain them at the construction site and not allow them to be transferred back to the River Bureau. Qi Shouan, the Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province, stating that the projects in each section were urgent and there was a great need for materials, making it impossible to find people, which could delay the construction. He specifically requested the Construction Department to verify and instruct. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>People's Hearts in Western Sichuan Are Stable</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Fei Dongming and Pan Wenhua will arrive in the province in the next few days. Heavy troops from the Sichuan Army and the Central Army have arrived in Chengdu one after another.

<h3>Guizhou Bandits Are Surrounded</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xue Yue telegraphed from Guizhou, stating that most of the bandits were in layers of encirclement and would not be difficult to annihilate in one fell swoop. The small groups that were searched and suppressed by our troops will also be cleared up. In the corner of Guiyang, a total of more than 4,000 bandits have been captured and surrendered. (Central News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Guiyang: More than 3,000 Communist bandits attempted to flee to Guangxi Province. The [redacted] division was ordered by Generalissimo Chiang to prevent the bandits from entering Guangxi no matter what, and to prevent them from fleeing south. Seeing that the southern route was blocked, the Communist bandits changed their direction and fled west, apparently intending to enter Yunnan. However, they were intercepted by the [redacted] division in Shunlong (phonetic). After a fierce battle lasting five hours, the bandits suffered more than 400 casualties. They then split into small groups and fled into Zhongshan. They are now surrounded by the [redacted] division together with reinforcements. (Reuters telegram from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Appropriation; Central Government Agrees to Increase Appropriation; Chairman Chiang Also Agrees to Allocate 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The central government's appropriation for Jiangxi is 250,000 yuan. Since January, only 50,000 yuan has been issued. Representatives from all walks of life in Jiangxi went to Beijing to petition. It is now learned that the central government has especially agreed to increase the appropriation by 100,000 yuan from April onwards, and it is also heard that Chairman Chiang has agreed to allocate 100,000 yuan from the headquarters, which will make up the amount of 250,000. However, the accumulated security expenses for these four months are very large, and the new year will soon begin. How should this sum of money be raised? It has not yet been determined. Therefore, the intention of all walks of life in Jiangxi is still to implore the central government to maintain the original plan and subsidize 250,000 yuan per month to ensure the safety of the local area.

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week Reports; Dai Chuanxian: Rescuing the National Economy; Zhang Ji: The Process of Sacrificing to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Jishan, Zhang Zhen, Wang Qi, Ji Liang, and all staff members, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, and Dai Chuanxian reported that in recent years, industry and commerce in our country have been declining, rural areas have been bankrupt, and the sluggishness of the market has reached its peak. Taking the silk industry as an example, it has been hit hard by artificial silk. Therefore, there is even a trend of "buy one get eight free" in the market, which is enough to prove that merchants can no longer maintain the word "credit." Taking Shanghai as an example, since the January 28th Incident, commerce has become increasingly depressed, and real estate prices have also fallen. This phenomenon is widespread throughout the country. I personally believe that this issue is extremely important. At present, the central government is concentrating the full efforts of financial institutions to rescue domestic industry and commerce. It is hoped that the heads of the financial community in various cities across the country will work together to solve this problem and revive the rural industry and commerce in the country as soon as possible. (Central News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Musong, Chen Shuren, Chen Daqi, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lin Xiang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various Yuan, Departments, and Commissions, totaling more than 500 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Zhang Ji reported on the process of sacrificing to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum, stating that this time, the National Government sent Commissioner Deng Jiayan, the Central Government sent Commissioner Shao Yuanchong, and himself to sacrifice to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum during the National Tomb-Sweeping Festival. Regarding the process, Commissioner Deng will have a detailed report upon his return to Beijing. I have returned to Beijing, and due to the limited time, I will only report on the outline as follows:</p>
<p>The Qiaoling Mausoleum is located in the central part of中部縣, north of Xi'an, more than 400 li from Xi'an. A highway has now been built for automobile traffic. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and historically, we have a great relationship with the revolution. Before the establishment of the Republic of China, the publications issued by the revolutionary groups organized by comrades of our party, such as the Minbao of the Tongmenghui, and the oaths of comrades of our party, all used the Yellow Emperor Era. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, when compiling party history, the publications collected all used the Yellow Emperor Era. The spirit of the martyrs of our party is completely centered on the spirit of the Yellow Emperor. This time, sweeping the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum was advocated by the Chairman. Due to the short time and the construction of the 450-li highway, due to changes in the terrain and rugged mountain roads, the height above the ground reached 1,460 meters in some places. This matter was entrusted to the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and it was only recently completed. The plateau where the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is located is about 700 meters high, surrounded by mountains. The terrain is extremely majestic. However, since the Republic of China, the idea of overthrowing despotism has deeply rooted in people's hearts. All the tombs of emperors of past dynasties are not only unattended, but also sold by local people without authorization. The trees on the mountain have been almost completely felled. The only remaining ones are the ancient cypresses in the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum, about 3,000 to 4,000 trees. Those that can be verified historically include more than 1,000 trees from the Tang Dynasty. The largest ones can be embraced by seven people. There are many stories about the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum that can be known from oral accounts, especially during the Han Dynasty, particularly during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. Subsequent dynasties also had sacrificial ceremonies. The so-called Qiaoling Mausoleum is one for the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum and one for the Yellow Emperor's Temple. The temple has now been destroyed and needs to be repaired urgently. Moreover, the climate of the northern mountains is more suitable for cultivating forests and is rich in treasures, which urgently need to be developed. However, the population of more than 20 counties in northern Shaanxi is extremely small, with no more than 50,000 people in each county. If we vigorously develop transportation and move the surplus population from the southeast to the northwest, it will be very easy to develop the northwest. As for the significance of this sacrificial mausoleum, it is to commemorate the great spirit of our dynasties for thousands of years. We should strive to restore the inherent glorious history of our nation to revive our nation. (Central News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Earthquake in Fuzhou Affected by Taiwan</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) There was an earthquake in Fuzhou on the morning of the 21st due to the influence of Taiwan. It gradually subsided after Chensi, which is rare in the past ten years. (Central News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There was an earthquake on the 21st in the entire island of Taiwan and Penghu Island. As of the evening of the 22nd, we have not received a report from the Taipei Consulate on whether our overseas Chinese have suffered any losses.

<h3>Twists and Turns in the Franco-Soviet Agreement</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union last spring, the representatives of both countries have done their utmost to act in concert on the international stage. As a result, the two countries first proposed the Eastern European Pact and then France introduced Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. Subsequently, there have been frequent rumors of a military alliance between France and the Soviet Union. From a superficial observation, it seems that the diplomatic relations between the two countries are harmonious and without any differences. However, only after the recent exposure of the draft of the Franco-Soviet Agreement did it become clear that the close relationship between France and the Soviet Union over the past year is indeed a fact, but there seem to be still issues regarding the conclusion of a military alliance of offense and defense. France wants to conclude an agreement with Russia within the framework of the League of Nations, while the Soviet Union expects an automatic mutual assistance pact. The former is modeled after the Locarno Pact in Western Europe, and the latter is similar to the pre-war offensive and defensive alliance. According to a European dispatch on the 20th, Litvinov abruptly ended his trip to Paris because France could not accept his proposal for automatic mutual assistance. From this, it can be seen that although the friendship between France and the Soviet Union has been more than a year, their wills and expectations have not yet been consistent.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why France and the Soviet Union want to conclude this agreement. First, they fear that Germany has no intention of concluding the Eastern European Pact, so they want to replace the effect of the Eastern European Pact with this agreement. Second, they want to use this to pressure Germany to accept the Eastern European Pact. Third, if Germany can join the Eastern European Pact, then this agreement can be used as a supplementary pact to the Eastern European Pact. When the Western European Locarno Pact was concluded in 1925, France separately concluded similar agreements with Poland and Czechoslovakia to assist the function of the Locarno Pact. The current Franco-Soviet Agreement is nothing more than an attempt to conclude it in advance, thereby pressuring Germany to comply. According to a Geneva dispatch on the 9th, the content of the draft Franco-Soviet Agreement is largely based on the Charter of the League of Nations. The nature of this agreement is purely similar to the Western European Locarno Pact and even more similar to the Franco-Polish and Franco-Czech treaties assisting the Locarno Pact. In a word, the function of these treaties is nothing more than seeking the application of League of Nations sanctions within the scope of the League of Nations, which is quite different from the pre-war offensive and defensive alliance. The difference between them can be understood by simply examining the provisions in the Locarno Pact. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Pact, if one of the contracting states believes that the other party has committed an act of aggression, it shall report the facts to the Council of the League of Nations. Only after the Council has verified the facts can it immediately notify the contracting states to assist the invaded party. This is significantly different from the automatic mutual assistance of an offensive and defensive alliance. The reason for such a provision is nothing more than to decide the responsibility of right and wrong by the League of Nations, so as not to allow warmongers to take advantage of it. However, when the Council of the League of Nations cannot unanimously accept the report, each country has the right to take free action out of the necessity of maintaining justice and fairness (see Article 2 of the Locarno Pact and Article 1 of the Franco-Polish and Franco-Czech treaties). The caution of the procedures regarding free action can be seen from this. Therefore, the function of the Locarno Treaty is not only to guarantee the security of France, but also to prevent France from freely invading Germany. The reason why Britain was willing to guarantee this treaty at that time was because this treaty had this spirit of maintaining peace. If the agreement that France wants to conclude with the Soviet Union wants to obtain Britain's support, it will inevitably not be able to surpass the precedent of the Locarno Treaty. Otherwise, gaining one Soviet Union and losing one Britain would not be worthwhile for France.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union seems to be focusing on the agility of military action and does not want to wait for the decision of a third party, which may delay the temporary military opportunity. Therefore, it advocates automatic mutual assistance and does not take the League of Nations as its main body. If this kind of treaty can be established, its power to restrain Germany will naturally be stronger than that of the Locarno-style treaty. However, judging from the situation in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union is now suspected by Poland. If the Franco-Soviet Agreement is indeed the same as the previous offensive and defensive alliance, Poland will feel uneasy. At present, France is trying to befriend Poland. This is also one of the reasons why France insists on taking the League of Nations as the main body for the Franco-Soviet Agreement. Although, if the Soviet Union aims at self-defense and also takes into account France's wishes, then the Franco-Soviet Agreement, despite many twists and turns, will eventually have the possibility of mutual conclusion.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the announcement of the Central Meteorological Observatory, the center of the major earthquake in Taiwan is located in the lower reaches of the Daan River on the border between Hsinchu Prefecture and Taichung Prefecture. The depth of the epicenter is still shallow, about 10 kilometers or less from the surface, so the ground shaking is extremely intense locally. There may still be considerable aftershocks in the future, but they will gradually subside. (22nd Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taipei According to the investigation of the Taiwan government, the major earthquake in Taichung Prefecture is the most intense since the Chiayi earthquake in 1906.

Yoshida reported on his meeting with Nagata, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, this morning, and then began deliberation. They adjourned after lunch. It is reported that the biggest difficulties at present are (1) the issue of the Seiyukai's participation and (2) the military's opinion on the Deliberation Council. (22nd Hua-lien Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nagata, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, visited Cabinet Secretary-General Yoshida on the morning of the 22nd. After listening to the government's detailed intentions regarding the Cabinet Deliberation Council issue, he explained the army's views as follows: (1) The Cabinet Deliberation Council is to select authoritative functional representatives from all parties to investigate and study the major national policies of the current extraordinary situation. It is also a very significant organization, which is what we expect. (2) Therefore, the selection of its members should be authoritative functional representatives from all parties and be knowledgeable and capable people. If it is used to assist the work of the Cabinet, it is absolutely opposed, and it is decided that the members of the Deliberation Council must also deliberate, study, and formulate plans for the Investigation Bureau in the future, and exercise endorsement. Therefore, there is no need to decide on any members in advance. The appointment of the Director of the Investigation Bureau, who handles actual affairs, should be valued. (3) Regarding the operation of the Deliberation Council, the army is doing its best to avoid recognizing it as an auxiliary organ of the Cabinet. Therefore, in principle, the Deliberation Council should remove matters related to the budget for the next year, because it should be considered as an organ that actually decides national policies for a long period of two or three years in the future.

<h3>New England Textile Industry Declines Sharply: Fifteen Factories Close; Over Ten Thousand Workers Unemployed</h3>
<p>Boston According to a survey by a certain party, the textile industry in the New England region is currently facing extremely difficult conditions. Fifteen major textile factories have closed this year, resulting in the unemployment of 12,000 workers. It is likely that several of them will not reopen. In addition, the factories that are still in operation have had to reduce their output. It is said that this situation is due to the government's collection of cotton production business tax and is not due to competition from Japanese goods. Therefore, manufacturers believe that the tax must be abolished before the textile industry can be hoped to recover. (22nd Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Regional Mutual Assistance Pact: Franco-Soviet Negotiations Suddenly Encounter Obstacles; Differences of Opinion Still Exist; Litvinov Returns Home to Report; France Does Not Want to Conflict with Obligations Under the Locarno Pact; Russia Insists on Having the Freedom to Use Force</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that negotiations on the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty between France and the Soviet Union have been temporarily suspended. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov originally planned to come here to sign the first word on the treaty, but was temporarily recalled to Moscow by the Russian government to report to the People's Committee on the negotiations with French Foreign Minister Laval. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not explain why the setback occurred. Many believe that it is because France wants the treaty to be established within the framework of the League of Nations and not to hinder France's obligations under the Locarno Pact, while Russia clearly wants the mutual assistance clauses to be automatic. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a statement released by TASS, "Negotiations between Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and French Foreign Minister Laval on the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact have been temporarily suspended. Mr. Litvinov has been summoned back to the country to report on the progress of the negotiations to the Soviet People's Committee." Regarding the temporary suspension of negotiations mentioned in the statement, we should know that Litvinov's negotiations could not continue as he traveled from Geneva to Moscow. As for Mr. Litvinov's intention to report on the difficulties in drafting the text of the Mutual Assistance Pact to the government, this is also a matter of course. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French press is paying close attention to the issue of Franco-Soviet cooperation. Le Siècle said that this cooperation has been felt in previous diplomatic negotiations, especially at the Stresa Conference and in Geneva. It is rumored in Geneva that the Franco-Soviet agreement will be signed soon, and we cannot deny the great impact of this statement. The newspaper continued, "France's efforts to conclude the Franco-Soviet Pact as soon as possible are precisely because the governments of some European countries are trying to undermine this pact." Le Petit Journal sought the opinions of French politicians on the Franco-Soviet Pact. Former Prime Minister Pangou responded, "I believe that if the Regional Mutual Assistance Pact is concluded within the scope of the League of Nations, it will strengthen the effect of obligations." Senator Sarraut expressed his welcome to the formal confirmation of Franco-Soviet friendship. Former Education Minister Anatole said that France wants peace, and so does the Soviet Union. Therefore, if the Soviet Union and France can work together, there will be results. He said that this treaty is by no means a military alliance against any country, but a new guarantee for us and the pacification of the world. (21st TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Parisian Newspaper Reveals Secret German-Polish Agreement with Military Mutual Assistance Clause, Valid for Two Years</h3>
<p>(Moscow) It is rumored that a secret agreement exists between Germany and Poland, containing clauses for military mutual assistance in case of aggression. Soviet Russian newspapers published this major news yesterday, reprinting it from a provincial French newspaper. The original article was signed by Raimu, a former French cabinet member. Soviet Russian newspapers published the article without criticism, while officials here neither confirmed nor denied it, remaining silent. It is said that the agreement was concluded on February 25th. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Germany and Poland signed a ten-year non-aggression pact on January 26th of last year, which improved their mutual relations. Subsequently, another agreement was concluded but has not been made public. According to the "National Welfare Newspaper" of Lyon, which published the full text obtained from former Commerce Minister Raimu, the contents are divided into eight articles. The "Parisian Echo" newspaper especially carried the following: (1) The contracting countries agree to consult each other directly and cooperate effectively on any international issues affecting them. (2) Poland agrees that all its diplomatic decisions shall conform to Germany's opinions and shall safeguard Germany's interests. (3) The contracting countries agree that if any international events occur that threaten the status quo, they shall immediately notify each other and reach mutual understanding to take beneficial measures. (4) The contracting countries agree that if one of the parties is attacked by a third country without provocation, they shall immediately resist jointly with their respective military, economic, and financial power. (5) Poland agrees that if Germany's eastern and northeastern neighbors provoke Germany, it shall allow German troops to pass freely through Polish territory. (6) Germany agrees to guarantee Poland's current borders. (7) The contracting countries agree to take all economic measures within the scope of common interests, especially economic measures sufficient to consolidate the defense matters of each country. (8) This agreement shall be valid for two years. Unless one of the contracting countries declares its termination six months in advance, it shall be automatically extended. Within the two-year term of this agreement, each contracting country may declare its termination six months in advance. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germans Emphasize Geneva Resolution, Maintaining Honor by Relying on Strength, Public Opinion Supports Government Policy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers commented on the government's protest against the League of Nations Administrative Council's adoption of the French proposal condemning Germany's reintroduction of compulsory military service. They all stated that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was justified. The "Germania Newspaper" stated that the implementation of compulsory military service could no longer be delayed for Germany's political calculations. The "Berlin Daily News" stated that the German government takes the resolution passed in Geneva very seriously. The "Local News" stated that the powers should recognize that Germany's protest merely expresses the thinking of all the German people. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) All German newspapers unanimously support the German government's formal protest against the League of Nations resolution of April 17th, narrating the historical oppression suffered from foreign countries that forced Germany to seek its own survival. The "Berlin Daily News" stated that when the German government announced the implementation of conscription on March 16th, it solemnly declared that limiting the German army to twelve army corps aimed to quell the slanderous talk of Germany intending to dominate. This number does not encompass all the able-bodied men in Germany eligible for military service. The other purpose of this resolution is to proclaim to the German and other peoples that Germany will henceforth maintain its honor and security by relying on its own strength. The content of the German note is also the same. Not long ago, the countries expressed willingness to gradually abolish the military provisions in the Treaty of Versailles. This was not done out of intimidation but because they recognized that the perpetual existence of that treaty would have only harmful consequences. However, this hope was never realized, so Germany ultimately had no choice but to seek its own survival. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Forms Government of National Unity, Duchiv Appointed Prime Minister, Military Faction Predominates, Foreign and Domestic Policies Continue Previous Cabinet's Policies</h3>
<p>Sofia Duchiv has recruited talents from major political parties to form a government of national unity. The list of the new cabinet has been approved by the King, but the appointment of General Atanasov to the post of Minister of Interior has been met with public criticism, as it is believed that the new cabinet has too much of a military character. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Sofia Duchiv encountered difficulties in forming a cabinet under orders and resigned to the King. The King then ordered him to try again, and after continuing negotiations with all parties, he formed a new cabinet. The list of cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Duchiv, Foreign Minister: Gosevalov, Interior Minister: Atanasov (Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army), Education Minister: General Radev, Finance Minister: Liasgov (President of the National Bank), Justice Minister: Galakivov (President of the Supreme Court), Army Minister: General Chanev (Commander of the Capital Garrison).</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Duchiv met with the King, he issued a declaration stating, "The new government is determined to continue the policies of the previous cabinet in domestic and foreign affairs. All actions will be based on the spirit of the coup of May 19th of last year (i.e., the day former Prime Minister Georgiev overthrew the Muchanov cabinet) and there will be no reactionary events," etc. The Military League has a dominant position in the new cabinet because the coup of May 19th last year was a victory for the military faction and a loss for the parliamentarians. Since the coup, the foreign policy of successive governments has focused on rapprochement with Yugoslavia. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>King's Proclamation to the People Appeals for National Unity</p>
<p>Sofia After the formation of the new cabinet, King Boris issued a proclamation to the people, countersigned by all cabinet members. The text reads: "After the reorganization of the cabinet, the life of the nation will by no means deviate from the path indicated by the events of May 19th of last year. From now on, the affairs of our young Bulgaria must be transformed to adapt to the complex needs of national life and the spirit of the new era, to seek economic recovery, and to provide effective assistance to the poor people. This transformation should be reflected in the constitution and approved by the people. The traditional concepts of the nation and the significance of the events of May 19th, which are enthusiastically supported by our people, should also be taken into consideration in the constitution, but the restoration movement cannot be accommodated. I now appeal to the people of the country to unite with me under the national flag." According to reports, after the formation of the new cabinet, various legal entities and lower-level military officers expressed their sincere support to the new prime minister, but the post office is still guarded by the military, and the royal palace is also under guard.

<p>Foreign Policy Focuses on Good Neighborliness, Maintaining Friendly Relations Between Southern Bulgaria</p>
<p>Sofia It is generally believed that the formation of the Toshev cabinet is a sign that King Boris has overcome factionalism, so the new cabinet can be said to be an expression of the King's will and must be supported by the people of the country. Foreign Minister Gosevalov was the first to advocate rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. After his joining the cabinet, some neighboring countries can have no worries about Bulgaria's foreign policy. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Commemorating Revolutionary Martyrs, Southern Ireland Passes Peacefully, Republican Army Parades, Avoiding Conflicts With Government Troops</h3>
<p>Dublin Although the situation is quite serious, the Easter celebrations passed peacefully. However, the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, Dumi, who had been wanted for a long time, was closely guarded by the Republican Army guards and appeared at the Glasnevin Cemetery, where Republican Party members who died in the bloody battles of the Easter Uprising of 1916 were buried, and delivered a passionate speech. After the speech, he quietly withdrew without interference. The head of the Irish Free State, Fannella, also gave a speech to the public at the post office, the center of the 1916 uprising, and received the salute of 7,000 Free State troops at that place. The troops marched past him in formation, which lasted two hours. Fannella had previously held a ceremony to unveil a monument to the fallen in the uprising. The monument was moved to a safe place by the Irish Republican Army because of their resentment of the government's recent arrests of party members, and was closely guarded all day. Fannella expressed his desire for the early establishment of the Irish Republic, but he felt that the time had not yet come to implement this. The Irish Republican Army also paraded, but far less vigorously than the Free State troops. The Irish Republican Army staggered to the cemetery in heavy rain and did not hold any ceremonies. The day passed peacefully without any incidents, and the people were relieved. Previously, the government troops and the Irish Republican Army were stationed in Dublin and its surrounding areas, preparing to stage demonstrations to commemorate the martyrs of the 1916 uprising. The two armies were facing each other, and the people were worried that the two sides might inevitably clash. Although the Irish Republican Army has recently been declared an illegal organization by the government, the authorities still allowed them to parade, but Woconnell Street, the site of the 1916 uprising, was not allowed to be passed through. Fortunately, they detoured and did not try to force their way through, so a conflict was avoided. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Details of Jesus' Passion, Accuracy of Biblical Account Proven by Anatomical Research</h3>
<p>(Paris) The account of Jesus' crucifixion in the Bible has recently been supported by anatomical evidence. According to the account, Jesus suffered five wounds during his passion: his hands and feet were pierced by nails, and his heart was pierced by a spear. When the body was removed from the cross, blood stains seeped into the shroud, which is clearly discernible. This shroud is currently kept in Turin, Italy. Dr. Barbet, a surgeon at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Paris, recently studied the five wounds from an anatomical perspective and conducted real-world tests on the corpse. The results matched the blood stains on the shroud. Barbet thus concluded that the account of Jesus' execution in the Bible is completely accurate. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Independent Labor Party Opposes Joining Communist International, National Communist Party Advocates Importance</h3>
<p>(London) The Independent Labor Party held a meeting in Derby today, with the majority deciding against joining the Communist International.

At the same time, the British Labor Party also held a meeting in Oxford, advocating an agricultural policy. The chairman of the National Labor Party Executive Committee, Smith, claimed that Britain can no longer be the world's manufacturing center, so workers must consider agricultural affairs. Dr. Addison estimated that Britain can produce domestically the 200 million pounds worth of food that Britain currently imports. However, the most important condition for active farming is nationalization of land. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Investigates Truth About Nuzillon Forest Securities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industry, the Nuzillon Wing On Forest Company has recently been promoting its forest securities in Nanjing and Shanghai, with each share priced at 30 English pounds.

Continuing to plant will result in endless cycles of profit. The ministry has requested the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the consulate in Wellington to investigate the truth nearby, as follows: (1) Regarding the gains and losses of future security profits, the company's manager declared to our country's consulate in Wellington that the company is not responsible, and only stated that it will manage well on behalf of the security holders. (2) The rapid growth rate of the pine trees mentioned in the advertisement is not as fast as it actually is. (3) Regarding the use of pine trees indicated in the original advertisement, it is still doubtful whether it can generate certain profits during the implementation of manufacturing.

<p>The Great Buddha Temple and Zuo Gong's Willow Trees</p>
<p>Leaving Changwu eastward, the car initially went along the south of the city. The city walls were trenched to form moats, naturally deep and dangerous. After twenty *li*, we arrived at Ranjia Shop. The villagers live in caves, with deep pits dug into the ground, about three to four *zhang* square. On each of the three walls, caves are carved for living or storing grain. The remaining walls are only pierced with tunnels, serving as doorways, either leading up to the ground or connecting horizontally to the four directions. Cattle and horses can also enter and exit freely. The bottom of the square pit serves as a courtyard, suitable for threshing wheat. Some pits even have surrounding walls. Poor families simply carve caves into the edge of a cliff, build walls and set up doors, and they can live there. After twenty-five *li*, we reached Tingkou, a small town located between Changwu and Bin counties, where a market is held. The road had already descended from the plateau and followed the banks of the Jing River. The fertile fields were either planted with wheat or poppies, all of which had sprouted green shoots. According to the farmers, one *mu* of poppies can yield twenty *liang* of opium, which can be sold for ten foreign dollars, just enough to cover the *mu* tax. In reality, there is no surplus profit to be made.</p>
<p>Entering Xie County to the east, formerly the ancient Yong 　State, is a strategic high ground. Newly built blockhouses, with their high and sturdy design, are quite convenient for watchmen. After twenty *li*, we arrived at the Great Buddha Temple, where a large Buddha is carved into a rock cave, with a single-faced hall built outside. The Buddha is seven or eight *zhang* tall, solemn and magnificent. Entering the temple to view it, one truly feels the awe of looking up to immense height. There are also many other large and small Buddha caves. All the engineering techniques are similar to those of the Buddhist caves in Datong and Dunhuang. This temple is the Qingshou Temple of the Tang Dynasty, supervised by Yuchi Jingde, also a major historical project. From here, jujube and pear orchards are abundant. After fifteen *li*, we arrived at Huaguo Mountain, where the Water Curtain Cave is also located. The cliffs and caves are dangerous and strange, and the scenery is beautiful and secluded. Climbing and sightseeing are accompanied by numerous legends. After ten *li*, we entered Bin City. The city is rectangular, with the Bin Mountain to the south and the Jing River to the north. The western part is desolate, while the eastern part is prosperous. A tall pagoda stands in the center, visible from afar. Pears, jujubes, and honey have long been famous products. The pears have yellow skin, thick stems, and are indeed incomparably fragrant and delicious. However, after careful tasting, they are still inferior to the Snowflake Pears of Ding County. We happened to see the local militia from the four villages, each carrying spears, coming to the city for inspection. They wore blue cloth round hats, with cotton wads wrapped on top like fists, and walked with a bobbing and swaying gait, no different from those worn by the clownish family servants in Peking opera. It seems to be a continuation of ancient styles, which is quite interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Leaving the city for three or four *li*, we ascended to the plateau again. Descending the winding road, we saw people living in caves, truly a case of "carriages and horses still pass over the rooftops." By the time we reached Yongshou County, the two cities were only seventy *li* apart. Yong City stands alone on a hillside, with a very small population, and has been repeatedly captured by bandits. The county government has been temporarily relocated to other towns. After forty *li*, we reached Jianjun Ba. There are still many residents. The road is low and sunken by eight or nine *chi*. The store doors and steps face each other like high banks. The market runs between the two sides, with carriages and horses traveling in the middle. Although the layout is old, it avoids congestion. Afterwards, we traveled on a flat plain for sixty or seventy *li*, sloping slightly downwards. The car traveled very quickly, heading straight to the north gate of Qian County. The terrain was still sloping. The sun had already set in the west, so we stayed at an inn. Many areas in the city are also desolate. The bustling areas are only in one part. The market people were dispersing, and the noise was chaotic. Beggars went from house to house asking for money, knocking on bamboo clappers and singing Qin腔 opera. Each household had a different tune, craning their necks and stamping their feet, their demeanor just like on a stage. The shopkeeper threw coppers early, and the beggar would definitely finish singing the last sentence of the opera according to the tune before bowing to pick them up and leaving leisurely. Are these also opera fans?</p>
<p>The "Zuo Gong's Willow Trees" planted on both sides of the Shaanxi-Gansu post road, during their prosperous period, stretched from Tongguan in the east to Jiayuguan in the west, for a total of thirty to forty *li*. Their high branches shaded the sun, and their thick foliage covered the road. Travelers on the road, enjoying the shade, all praised the legacy of Zuo. It is not easy to advocate planting trees, and it is even more difficult to grow trees into forests. To form a forest with historical value, national defense, and transportation significance is especially commendable. Unfortunately, the government offices in the counties along the willow line do not know how to protect them, and they allow unruly people to wantonly destroy them, either peeling the bark in search of insects under the pretext of treating diseases, or claiming that they were broken by wind and rain, stealing and felling them for firewood, resulting in broken stretches, no longer as prosperous as before. Especially on the post roads we passed in the past two days, often traveling for dozens of *li* without a single tree, the desolation is overwhelming, truly letting down the predecessors.</p>
<p>The uses of forests are extremely extensive. In terms of industrial needs, in addition to construction, they can be used to make various paper materials, rayon, medicines, photographic films, paints, alcohol, and smokeless gunpowder. Among all countries, only the Soviet Union, Canada, and Poland can be self-sufficient in forest products. Our country, however, mostly relies on imports. Every year, timber imports average 30 million yuan, which is indeed a major drain. Although the Northwest has a vast area, it is mostly barren mountains and wilderness, left to waste, abandoning resources in the ground. We already feel the lack of production and suffer from droughts and floods. If we can cultivate forests on this land, we can immediately create a source of wealth. Moreover, the climate of the Northwest is continental and desert-like. When the north wind rises, dust and sand cover the sky. The idea that deserts are migrating south is not unfounded. If we do not actively afforest, the future is truly worrying. The benefits of afforestation, such as planting pines and firs, can yield more than eight times the profit after twelve years. Planting tung trees yields fruit in three years and abundant harvests in five years. By the eighth or ninth year, each tree can yield an average profit of seven or eight yuan. If you plant one thousand two hundred trees, you can earn one ten thousand yuan in profit every year. The cost is small and the profit is large, which is unmatched by other trees. In particular, Shaanxi Province, known for its tung oil, should vigorously promote planting. As for the indirect benefits of afforestation, such as regulating the climate, conserving water sources, preventing droughts and floods, sheltering against wind and sand, enhancing scenery, and benefiting sanitation, they are too numerous to mention. The French scholar Cortelbert once said, "What destroys France is not foreign enemies, but the devastation of its mountains and forests." This statement is no different from prescribing acupuncture for our Northwest. In the future, we should plant new trees extensively and protect old forests, and we should take both approaches simultaneously, without further delay.</p>
<h3>The Current State of Northern Manchurian Soybeans Under Japanese and Puppet Manipulation: The Japanese and Puppet Authorities Buy Soybeans at Low Prices for Profit; Anticipating Reduced Sales, They Will Restrict Planting</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Northern Manchurian soybeans occupy an important position in the world market. Since July of last year, when Germany temporarily banned the import of oilseed raw materials, the export of Northern Manchurian soybeans has been severely hit, and the price per *pu* dropped to around five *jiao*. The puppet Ministry of Industry, seeing the potential for profit, implemented manipulation and organized the Daxing Company to buy soybeans at low prices. Last year, Northeast China suffered from severe floods, and the soybean harvest in the flooded areas was greatly reduced, accounting for only one-third of previous years. The oilseed raw materials such as rapeseed and flaxseed in Western European countries also had poor harvests. Later, Germany resumed soybean imports due to its commercial treaty with Japan. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet authorities vigorously sought to sell soybeans to various parts of South China. As a result, soybean exports showed signs of recovery. The Japanese and puppet authorities made heavy profits in the process, and the soybean market price rose from five *jiao* to six *jiao*. During this period, the market price was temporarily stable for a while. Soon, as soybean stocks decreased day by day, speculators rushed to buy, and the market gradually increased. On February 21 of this year, the price of soybeans rose to one yuan, three *jiao*, six *fen*, five *li* per *pu*, the highest soybean price in recent years. Before long, it gradually decreased again. At present, it is one yuan, one *jiao*, six *fen*, which is still not lower than the price of seven or eight *jiao* per *pu* in December last year. Many people with stocks are waiting and watching and not selling. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities want to implement export manipulation, so they say that Western European countries have planted more rapeseed and flaxseed and other oilseeds to resist soybean imports. Japan is also using chemical methods to manufacture various fertilizers to replace the purchase of bean cakes and other things. It is predicted that soybean exports are not optimistic. Therefore, they have set a restriction plan. Those in Southern Manchuria who plant more miscellaneous grains will plant more cotton in the future. Those in Northern Manchuria who plant more soybeans will plant more wheat in the future to limit soybean production and promote exports to lower market prices. As for the wheat production in Northeast China, the annual output is often not enough for local use, and imports are more than exports. Therefore, it is also possible to restrict the planting of more wheat. At the same time, the puppet authorities are studying the promotion of soybean uses, planning to use soybeans to manufacture benzene refined oil, food, and other various oils, in order to manipulate soybean prices again. Therefore, the future of soybeans is a problem worthy of attention. (Tohoku News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Set Up Hospital in Pangjiang: The Hospital Is a Disguised Espionage Agency</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Japanese have long coveted Inner Mongolia. Recently, they established a hospital near the De Wang Mansion in Pangjiang. Although it is called a hospital, it is actually a disguised espionage agency. The Japanese in the hospital engage in various activities. The Chahar Provincial Government has repeatedly lodged protests, but the Japanese claim that they will withdraw the hospital after the Chahar Provincial Government establishes a hospital in Pangjiang. The Chahar authorities are planning to establish an Inner Mongolia Hospital in the area. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar, arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou last night. At 10 p.m., he accompanied Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying to the Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin to report on the inspection in Pangjiang. (20th)</p>
<h3>Various Products in Jiangxi Province Decline Sharply: Exports Decrease by 90 Percent; Trade Deficit Reaches More Than 30 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has fertile land, a dense population, abundant agricultural products, and many famous handicrafts. Before 1928 and 1929, export trade was increasing day by day. For example, in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, the total value of exports was 18.9 million yuan. By 1928, it had increased to 61.4 million yuan, an increase of more than three times in twenty years, and it often maintained a trade surplus. In 1919, exports were 53.4 million yuan, with a trade surplus of 23.8 million yuan. In recent years, exports have declined sharply, and imports have increased sharply, forming a contrary picture. For example, cigarette imports have increased forty times in twenty years, and kerosene, steel, and other products have increased more than ten times. By 1931, there was a trade deficit of 35,233,000 yuan, and exports were almost extinct. Money flowed out, forming a state of blood depletion. The decline of various special products is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Rice: There is no land in Jiangxi Province that does not produce rice. According to general estimates, the annual rice production is always more than 66 million *dan*. The amount exported through Jiujiang was 2.4 million *dan* in 1924, worth 17 million yuan, but later decreased to 128,000 *dan*, a decrease of 95 percent. In the past two years, we have relied on foreign rice for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Porcelain: The porcelain of Jingdezhen has a history of thousands of years and is famous overseas. During its heyday, there were more than 10,000 porcelain factories, with more than 100,000 porcelain workers. The total value of the products was 20 million taels of silver. All countries in the world were markets for our porcelain. According to the statistics of the Jiujiang Gutang Customs, our country's porcelain exports have decreased from 127,000 *dan* to 50,000 *dan*, a decrease of 61 percent. Recently, it has become even more precarious.</p>
<p>Ramie Cloth: The ramie cloth produced in Wanzai, Yihuang, Pingxiang, Yichun, Chongren, Linchuan, Qianshan, Yushan, Guangchang, Ningdu, and other places is the most common household handicraft. In 1930, 24,000 *dan* were exported, worth more than 6.7 million yuan, but it soon decreased to 3,700 *dan*, a decrease of 82 percent. Recently, it has become unspeakable.</p>
<p>Paper: The province produces bamboo everywhere, which is a natural raw material for papermaking. Qianshan, Guangfeng, Guixi, and fifty of the province's eighty-one counties produce tea. The annual output is about 500,000 *dan*. In 1923, exports reached 329,800 *dan*, worth 20 million yuan, and sales spread throughout Europe and the United States. Recently, it has decreased to 65,400 *dan*, a decrease of 80 percent. Although there are no statistics for last year, it is undeniable that it is getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>Tobacco: Tobacco such as that from Guangfeng and Guangchang is of excellent quality. The annual output is about 330,000 *dan*. Exports have decreased from 215,000 *dan* to 33,000 *dan*, a decrease of 85 percent.</p>
<p>Tungsten Ore: Southern Jiangxi is full of tungsten ore, which is a rare and valuable metal. The output accounts for 60 percent of the world's total. The amount exported from Jiujiang reached more than 100,000 *dan* in 1926, worth more than 2 million yuan. The amount exported from Guangdong must be even greater. Recently, most of the producing areas have fallen into the hands of bandits, and sales have plummeted. Other products such as jute, sesame, soybean oil, and cowhide, as well as various other products, are almost all declining. (March 15)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Bans Opium: Implementing a General Inspection; Special Inspectors from the Headquarters Arrive for Review; The Provincial Government Also Appoints Special Commissioners for Each District</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province is an absolutely prohibited opium planting province, and also a relatively prohibited opium smoking province. Therefore, although opium paste is contracted by merchants through the Opium Suppression Inspectorate for sales, opium seedlings are still ordered by the provincial government to be eradicated by various counties. The areas that have been most heavily producing opium, such as the counties of Fuan, Fuding, Ningde, and Xiapu in Eastern Fujian, the counties of Anxi, Tong'an, Jinjiang, and Hui'an in Southern Fujian, and the counties of Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Yongding, and Shanghang in Western Fujian, have mostly reported that eradication is complete. Now, in order to urge inspection, increase efficiency, and the current headquarters has specially appointed Gao Hailan as a special inspector for the suppression of opium planting in Fujian, and will jointly implement a general inspection with the provincial government. Gao has already arrived in Fujian for many days and has set up an office on Daoshan Road in the city. The provincial government has appointed Liu Jitang as the special commissioner for the suppression of opium planting in the first administrative district, Zhao Qinglian as the special commissioner for the second district, Wang Yawu as the special commissioner for the third and tenth districts, Huang Yixiong as the special commissioner for the fourth district, Shen Yuchun as the special commissioner for the fifth district, Sun Tongxi as the special commissioner for the sixth district, and Liao Ji as the special commissioner for the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts, all under the command of the special inspection commissioner, and will go to various districts to implement inspections. It can be seen that the districts to which the appointed special commissioners belong include the first district, which is Chang Le; the second district, which is Fu An; the fourth district, which is Xian You; the fifth district, which is Tong An; and the sixth district, which is Zhang Pu; all of which are opium planting areas, and the inspection procedures are very complicated. Therefore, a special commissioner is appointed for each district. The third district is Nan Ping, and the tenth district is Pu Cheng. The climate is cold and it is not suitable for opium planting. The seventh district is Shao Wu, the eighth district is Long Yan, and the ninth district is Chang Ting. All are newly recovered areas, and opium seedlings have long been cleared. The inspection procedures are relatively simple. Therefore, one special commissioner is appointed for every two or three districts. As for the expenses of the opium suppression special commissioner, the entire monthly budget must be more than 4,000 yuan, which is designated by the headquarters to be allocated from the special tax revenue of the Opium Suppression Inspectorate in this province, including the special commissioner's salary of 140 yuan, the staff member's salary of 50 yuan, the clerk's salary of 20 yuan, the public servant's wages of 14 yuan, the special commissioner's food and lodging expenses of 90 yuan, the staff member's food and lodging expenses of 60 yuan, the clerk's food and lodging expenses of 45 yuan, the public servant's food and lodging expenses of 24 yuan, the boat and vehicle expenses of each staff member and public servant of about 100 yuan, and special expenses such as pens, ink, paper, printing, postal and telegraph expenses of 50 yuan per month, totaling 604 yuan per district per month. However, the position of special commissioner is mostly filled by personnel transferred from the provincial government and various listening offices, so they only receive their original salary and do not receive additional pay. Now, as soon as each special commissioner is ready, they can set off. As for the matter of opium suppression, it will be implemented starting from Minhou County in the province. The county government has formulated and issued twelve articles of the measures for issuing opium cessation permits within a limited time, seven articles of the opium cessation measures for opium addicts, and ten articles of the opium addict's self-initiated opium cessation registration certificate form, ordering the various district offices to comply with and handle them, and announcing them to all opium addicts in the county. Those who cannot quit opium immediately due to old age or illness may report the reasons to the various districts and apply for a license in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Those who voluntarily quit opium should also report to the district office and issue a self-initiated opium cessation registration certificate within a limited time. Those who disobey or wait and see and delay in applying for a license will be arrested and sent to the county's opium cessation hospital for compulsory treatment, and will be severely punished according to law.

<h3>Suzhou: The Relocation of the High Court to Zhenjiang Has Been Called Off</h3>
<p>Three months ago, there was talk of relocating the Jiangsu Higher Court to Zhenjiang. The public interest groups of Wu County and the lawyers' associations of Changshu, Haimen, and other places submitted petitions to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting a postponement. According to news from the High Court, the proposal to relocate the High Court to Zhenjiang has now been abandoned. It is planned to set up a Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court in Zhenjiang, and the old site of the Provincial Government has been designated as the location of the court. The Suzhou High Court has jurisdiction over the appeals of twenty-five counties, including Wu County, Changshu, Wujin, Wuxi, Wujiang, Kunshan, Yixing, Jingjiang, Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Jiangyin, Shanghai, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Baoshan, Chongming, Haimen, Jinshan, Qingpu, Chuansha, Taicang, Jiading, and Qidong. The appeals of the other twenty-four counties, including Jiangpu, are handled by the Fifth Branch. The above plan is expected to be implemented this year.</p>
<h3>Land and Water Police Units Defend Against and Suppress Lake Bandits</h3>
<p>Recently, large groups of lake bandits have been frequently discovered along Tai Lake, intending to cause trouble. Fortunately, after the joint suppression by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang land and water police units, the lake bandits have fled separately, and the residents near the lake can live in peace. However, although these lake bandits have fled, there is still the possibility of them regrouping. Therefore, Zhou, the district chief of the Second District of the Water Police, and Nie, the captain of the Security Brigade, convened a meeting in Suzhou yesterday with the security captains of various counties such as Wujiang to discuss the issue of joint defense. At that time, it was decided that if bandit groups are discovered, they should cooperate in suppressing them regardless of territorial boundaries, and Wujiang will send a team to patrol various places near the lake to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Thorough Investigation of the Embezzlement Case of the Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Gao Lian (Chongshan), the chief of the Second Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau of this county, and bureau member Ji Yaping, were recently accused by Tao Shiliang and others to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of privately collecting gratuities from inns and protecting the four major vices of opium, gambling, and prostitution, requesting their dismissal and investigation. The Ministry of Civil Affairs secretly ordered the county government of this county to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a report for verification and handling. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send inspector Feng Yimao to the sub-bureau yesterday to conduct an investigation and to investigate the area along the roads under the jurisdiction of the sub-bureau. However, one theory is that the higher-ups were not accused, but rather the Ministry of Civil Affairs' report on governance work mentioned that Gao and Ji were privately collecting gratuities and protecting opium, gambling, and prostitution, so the county was ordered to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Dies from Abortion</h3>
<p>Yang Ada, a female worker at the Qingfeng Second Yarn Factory in Zhoushanbang, nicknamed "Bai'er Gou," is from Gushan, Jiangyin. She currently lives at No. 3 Xiaocaichang, Zhoushanbang, in this county. At nineteen years old, she is fond of dressing up. Last autumn, she became acquainted with Qian Huangen, the manager of the Jiaotong Rubber Company on Tonghui Road. Their love grew deeper, and they wished to grow old together. However, Qian already had a legal wife, Cao, and was hesitating. Then, Cao suddenly died. Qian immediately decided to formally marry Ada in November of this year. However, Ada was already pregnant. Qian was afraid that she would be heavily pregnant at the wedding, causing ridicule, so he bought an abortion pill and made Ada take it. However, the drug was too strong, and she suffered severe abdominal pain. She died on the 18th of this month, a tragic end.</p>
<h3>One Thief Robs Two Families in a Row</h3>
<p>In Sifang Lane, near Chenshu Town in the seventh district of the county, the home of farmer Zhu Aba was suddenly broken into by a thief in the middle of the night the other day. The thief pried open the door and dragged Aba out of bed, tied his hands, and took out a pistol, threatening him in every possible way, forcing him to reveal the location of his hidden silver. The thief searched according to the address. Then, Aba took the opportunity to break free, risked his life to escape, and shouted for help. The neighbors rose up and took up arms to catch the thief. By this time, the thief had already heard and escaped to the roof. Fearing being pursued, he hid in the Rangcun Nunnery about a *li* away. Huang, the old woman who guarded the nunnery, saw the thief and shouted to catch him. The thief immediately knelt down and begged her not to make a sound. Huang felt sorry for him and did not drive him away. Who knew that when the thief left, he robbed her second daughter of a handbag, which contained cash, clothes, and other items, worth more than 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Refugee Tragically Run Over and Killed by Train</h3>
<p>Jiang Shunjin, a refugee from Yixing, nineteen years old, recently fled the famine with his neighbors. At about 4 p.m. on the 20th, a group of eight people carried their belongings, planning to go to Wuxi from Changzhou, walking along the railway. When they reached the 167th kilometer of Dingyan, a train came head-on. Shunjin could not avoid it and fell into the tracks, tragically being run over and killed. Afterwards, the county court reported the incident, and prosecutor Guan Junjie went to examine the body on the 21st. He instructed the townspeople to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Red Cross Comes to Yangzhou to Distribute Emergency Relief</h3>

He arrived in Yangzhou on the 20th by way of Zhenjiang and Wei and went directly to the Jiangdu Red Swastika Sub-branch. Members of the association and local gentry, such as Zhu Ganchen, properly entertained him. On the morning of the 21st, the district chiefs of the two districts and representatives of the disaster victims heard the news and entered the city to report everything to Li and others, and heard that Li and others had brought relief funds ranging from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. It was decided to divide into two teams on the 22nd, one to distribute to Beiliuji and other places in the eighth district, and the other to inspect Fangjiaxiang Yijiaji and other places in the ninth district. It was also heard that Chairman Li was anxious to leave Yangzhou for Tianjin tomorrow, and Li Baozhen will be in charge of the relief work here.</p>
<h3>Sending Female Students to Train in Silkworm Breeding</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Ma of Jiangdu received an order from the Department of Construction, stating that the Sericulture Improvement Association of the National Economic Council has specially set up a trial department to study scientific methods of silkworm breeding and seed production, recruit female students for training, and send them to various places after graduation to guide the work of silkworm farmers. He was ordered to nominate a female student and report on May 1. He specially followed this (20th) to select Hu Hezhi, a female graduate of the senior department of the Beipailou Elementary School in the central district of the county, and prepared a document for nomination, so that she can report for training at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Tax Police Yin Changyin Detained on Suspicion</h3>

<h3>Fire Brigade Cables Requesting Investigation of Police Shooting Case</h3>
<p>Jiang Yanchun, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, previously got into a police shooting case for watching a play without a ticket. Now, the Fire Fighting Federation has cabled a report to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent Wang Zhuoping to the county and questioned the related people, Wang Shihua, etc., at the Xinmin Theater, and returned to the province to report. The various Yi Dragons have now been temporarily taken back by the backbone team. It is heard that many parts have been damaged, and the various members of the Dragon have resigned. The police have also gone on strike for two days in protest.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Carelessness at Dachang Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The motor department of the Dachang Silk Weaving Factory on Zhicheng Road in this city caught fire suddenly at about 10 p.m. yesterday (the 20th). The fire was very fierce.

He came to Hangzhou alone some time ago, using the alias Zhonghe, staying at the Dongxing Hotel near the city railway station. He secretly purchased sleeping pills and ingested them in an attempt to commit suicide. However, he had written a farewell letter to his wife and concubine beforehand.  After receiving the news, they rushed to Hangzhou and found Wang barely alive.  He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment.  After the doctor administered acupuncture and gastric lavage, his life was no longer in danger and he is still receiving treatment in the hospital.</p>
<h3>Children and Mothers Joint Celebration</h3>

He was arrested a few days ago by Xu Qicheng, the captain of the first security detachment stationed in Niuhong Port, and escorted to the county. Yesterday, Chen Cheng interrogated him and ordered him to be detained.</p>
<h3>Female Student Suddenly Disappears</h3>
<p>Chen Shao'an's daughter, Pinqing, 20 years old, residing on West Street in the county, is currently a third-year student in the junior high department of the Zhengfeng Literary Academy in Shanghai. She suddenly disappeared on the afternoon of the 18th.  The school ordered people to search in all directions, but to no avail. They then telegraphed her family. After receiving the news, Chen took a steamer to Shanghai to investigate that same day.  Today (the 20th), Chen sent a letter home, stating that a suicide note was found on Pinqing's bed, which read, "Because my grades in this semester's exams were too poor and I cannot graduate, I am committing suicide in the Huangpu River. I hope my parents will not be too sad." However, Pinqing has not yet been found. The family was deeply saddened by this news.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xiangmao's House Robbed</h3>
<p>In Duanwei, southeast of Qidong Jiujiang Town, farmer Zhu Xiangmao, whose family is of modest means, was suddenly visited by seven or eight bandits in the middle of the night. They spoke in mixed dialects, each holding a box gun, and broke into the house. Zhu was awakened from his sleep and escaped through the back door. The bandits then grabbed Zhu's wife, beat her severely with wooden sticks, and demanded that she hand over the hidden money, but failed.  They then rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching at will. At this time, Zhu had gathered villagers, sounded gongs, and lit fires, coming to surround and arrest the bandits. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits began to flee, making loud noises. The stolen silver dollars, clothes, ornaments, and other items were worth about 50 yuan. The victim reported the incident to the county government yesterday, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Mission Leader's Speech</p>
<p>Mission Leader Forbes issued a written statement upon arriving in Shanghai, saying, "I believe that this is the most thorough investigation by American business circles to this great country. The special development of air transport in China is of great help to this investigation. I deeply believe that this is the first time that a delegation of American business representatives has traveled to the new China by plane to conduct a detailed and extensive investigation. The railway and air travel programs have been arranged, which will be of great benefit to the work of the mission. The purpose of the mission's visit to China is to study the past, present, and future business relations between China and the United States. There are no government representatives or financial assistance in the American Economic Mission. The mission's motives and all expenses are borne by American industrial, commercial, and banking circles and states that have relations with the Far East. All members of the mission are the most relevant people in American banking, food, tobacco, textile, aviation, and shipping industries. Although the mission does not have a specific investigation task, we will do our best to promote the increase in trade between the two countries. We are fact-finders and have no executive power. The whole mission should have a common understanding and desire for the principles of developing trade between the two countries, which is the most important task in our minds. On behalf of the mission, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Mr. Zhang Fu'ao, Chairman of the reception committee, and the representatives of the reception committee, for providing various conveniences for us. After visiting Beijing and meeting with the government authorities of your country, we will return to Shanghai and exchange views with the leaders of the Shanghai business community. After that, the whole mission will tour the north, south, and central parts of China and meet with local Chinese business leaders. Another group will visit the Philippines. After the entire trip is completed, the whole mission will gather in Shanghai and collect the materials obtained to hold a final consultation with the leaders of the Shanghai business community.</p>

<h3>Tongtai Zhuang Suspended Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu and Chen, the lawyers representing the liquidation of Xinsheng News Agency, said that the Shanghai industrial and commercial situation will soon reach the bottom of the fourth quarter. Following the suspension of business liquidation of Yongxing Qianzhuang, a member of the Money Trade Association, a few days ago, Tongtai Shunji Qianzhuang also suspended business liquidation yesterday morning due to insufficient capital turnover. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Qianzhuang</p>
<p>Tongtai Huihua Qianzhuang was established in January of the tenth year of the Republic of China with a total capital of 340,000 yuan. The shareholders were originally Tan Bushao (six shares), Le Zhenbao (two shares), Tan Zilin (one share), and Huang Zhenrong (one share), a total of ten shares. The manager was Fu Yuzhai and the associate manager was Chuan Yujing. The address was No. 240 Ningbo Road, North City. During the year-end closing in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, it was successfully reorganized. Shareholders Le Zhenbao and Huang Zhenrong split their shares, Tan Bushao increased his shares by two to eight shares, and Tan Zilin increased his shares by one to two shares. It was also renamed Tongtai Shunji. The manager and associate manager remained the same.</p>
<p>Difficulty the Night Before</p>
<p>The Qianzhuang's business volume is quite large, always over one or two million yuan. Now, due to the impact of the poor market situation, the loans issued, such as long-term credit, overdrafts, and mortgages, cannot be recovered. The Qianzhuang lacks circulating funds. At 8:00 PM the night before, the difference between the amount received and the amount disbursed was very large, resulting in insufficient capital turnover and a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, manager Fu Yuzhai and Fu Yujing rushed around and the shareholders advanced money to maintain the business and overcome the difficulty. Therefore, the Qianye Tongye Gonghui (Money Trade Association) note from the Qianzhuang last night was also cleared in full.</p>
<p>Decision to Suspend Business</p>
<p>After the shareholders advanced money to maintain the business and overcome the difficulty the night before, the Qianzhuang colleagues all thought that the Qianzhuang would have no problems. However, Qianzhuang manager Fu Yuzhai and shareholders Tan Bushao and Tan Zilin temporarily decided that</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Held a Board Meeting Yesterday   Two Additional Standing Directors Elected   Chairman and General Manager Remain the Same</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that after the Bank of Communications increased government shares by 10 million yuan, which was approved by the shareholders' meeting, the Ministry of Finance appointed Wang Rutang and seven others to serve as government-share directors and supervisors. All directors and supervisors of the bank held separate meetings yesterday afternoon and elected Song Ziliang and Yang Xiaofu as standing directors. There were no changes to the chairman and general manager. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Two Additional Standing Directors Elected</p>
<p>The first board meeting of the Bank of Communications after the increase in share capital was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the conference room on the fourth floor of the bank. The attending government-share directors were Zhang Shouyong, Li Chengyi, Qin Zuce, Wang Rutang, Zhu Ziliang, Yang Dunfu, Xu Xinliu, Yang Xiaotian, Shen Shuyu, and the commercial-share directors were Hu Bijang, Tang Shoumin, Qian Yongming, Hu Zutong, Zhou Zuomin, Li Ming, Wang Chengzhu, Chen Huide, Ye Fuji, Yang Desen, etc. Qian Yongming was temporarily elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that after the increase in government shares, according to the 14th article of the revised regulations, there should be seven standing directors, and two more should be elected. After mutual election, Song Ziliang and Yang Dunfu were elected as standing directors. The terms of the original standing directors have not expired, so there were no changes.</p>
<p>Chairman and General Manager Remain in Office</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the chairman of the bank must be appointed by the Ministry of Finance from among the standing directors, and the general manager must be selected by the chairman in consultation with the standing directors from among the directors and appointed with the approval of the board of directors. Since the current chairman Hu Bijang and general manager Tang Shoumin took office, the business has made rapid progress. The total assets of the bank this year have increased by as much as 70 million yuan compared to the previous year. Both government and business parties have expressed their trust in them, so the two men were re-elected. After discussion by the board of directors, it was decided that Song Ziliang and Qian Xinzhi would visit Finance Minister Kong to report and bring the commission letter for addition.</p>
<p>Supervisory Meeting Held at the Same Time</p>
<p>The supervisory meeting was held at the same time in the bank. The attending government-share supervisors were Xu Xiuzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, and Zhao Dihua, and the commercial-share supervisors were Ye Chongxun, Zou Minchu, and Jia Shiyi, etc. Zhao Dihua chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that according to Article 24 of the bank's articles of association, one resident supervisor should be elected. As a result, Xu Xiuzhi was still elected to serve.</p>
<p>No Changes to Internal Organization</p>
<p>According to reporters, after the increase in shareholders in the bank, in addition to the Ministry of Finance adding eight directors and supervisors, there were no changes to the internal organization. However, in the past, all bank affairs were handled by the general manager, but now it is stipulated that standing directors must also go to the bank regularly to perform their duties, so their business will develop more and more. The result of the meeting was that the loans issued were difficult to recover for a while, and the dangerous atmosphere outside had been leaked. If all depositors rush to withdraw money, it will be impossible to cope with. It was decided to suspend business starting yesterday morning, so the Qianzhuang suspended business yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Announce Liquidation</p>
<p>After the Qianzhuang decided to suspend business, it entrusted Wu Linkun and Chen Zhongyin, lawyers from the Tongren Law Office, to announce the suspension of business liquidation. The lawyer's announcement stated, "Recently, Fu Yuzhai, manager of Tongtai Shunji Zhuang, and Fu Yujing, deputy manager, stated that our Zhuang has been affected by the poor market situation, resulting in insufficient capital turnover, and we have to suspend business liquidation of accounts. For this reason, we entrust your lawyers to announce to the public that all debtors are required to go to our Zhuang liquidation office within 14 days to pay off debts. Overdue debts will not be handled and will be pursued according to law. As for all creditors, it is also hoped that within 14 days, they will bring their debt certificates to register at our Zhuang liquidation office." Therefore, this special announcement is made to the right, please take note. April 22.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Meeting with reporters this morning, the Xinxin News Agency reports that Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Committee and Chairman of the Bank of China, has recently felt slightly fatigued due to his busy schedule.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company  Liu Hongsheng Returned to Shanghai Yesterday  The Ministry of Communications Approved the Waiver of Salary and Public Funds Without Discussion</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized, it was vigorously reorganized and gradually improved. However, due to the huge old debt of 28 million yuan, the annual surplus was insufficient to offset the interest. In order to save expenses, General Manager Liu Hongsheng submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for approval to waive his salary and public funds. The Ministry has approved the request without discussion. Mr. Liu went to Beijing last Saturday to visit Minister Zhu Jiaqi of the Ministry of Communications and Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, to ask for instructions on reorganizing the old debts, etc. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle important official matters. It is heard that the reorganization plan is difficult to carry out due to limited financial resources. He is still trying to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Return to His Post  Ambassador Talked About the Growing Amity Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, returned to his country on leave last November to report on the situation in China to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet Union.

The Russian Ambassador shook hands with all the welcoming personnel one by one, and after landing at the Avenue Edward VII pier, he went directly to the Consulate General to rest.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador's Talk</p>
<p>Ambassador Bogo wore a purple suit and was still in good spirits. He said on the ship that he would naturally report on his experience in China to the Foreign Affairs Committee during his leave. Now that his leave is over, he is returning to his post. He said that it is gratifying that the relations between China and Russia are getting closer. The signing of the Sino-Russian trade agreement depends on the attitude of both parties. He has just arrived in Shanghai and has not yet decided when to visit Acting Foreign Minister Wang in Beijing. It is also learned that the local Russian community will host a banquet to welcome Ambassador Bogo back and inquire about the situation in his country.</p>

<h3>China Navigation Cooperation: Board of Directors to be Established on May 1st</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's approval response for the nationwide navigation cooperation has arrived. It has been decided to formally establish the organization ahead of schedule on May 1st. As this concerns the recovery of navigation rights and the realization of cooperation, the details will be published again as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperation Principles</p>
<p>This association is established in accordance with the concrete plan for China Navigation Cooperation approved by the Ministry of Transportation on December 29th, the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). The principles of this association are coexistence and co-prosperity, striving for navigation cooperation, protecting navigation routes, regulating supply and demand, and undertaking other cooperative matters as its mission. The office and joint business offices for each navigation route will be located in Shanghai. Branch offices and agencies may be established in other locations. The concrete cooperation plan is based on the minutes of previous meetings. Regarding water and land intermodal transportation, it is still based on the resolution of the joint meeting of the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways, with civil aviation participating in the water and land intermodal transportation meeting.</p>
<p>Membership Qualifications</p>
<p>All Chinese-nationality shipping companies are eligible to be members. The cooperative matters agreed upon by members before the establishment of the cooperative shall be transferred to the association. Members have the responsibility to assist the association in carrying out various cooperative matters, abide by various resolutions, and bear various legitimate expenses. If three directors believe that a resolution of the members' meeting is difficult to implement, it can be decided by the board of directors, or the decision to approve or reject it will not be established. The standing director may submit it to the members' meeting at any time or submit it to the Ministry of Transportation for review.</p>
<p>Early Establishment</p>
<p>The cooperation plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for approval and record. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, based on the draft cooperation plan, sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipowners Association, requesting the rapid organization of the board of directors and requesting that the board of directors of the China Navigation Cooperative be formally organized and established on May 1st. Then, the board of directors will generate a secretariat, specialized committees, and joint operating offices for each route. After discussion by the Municipal Shipowners Association, it was decided to hold a board of directors election meeting next Monday at 2:00 PM. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will nominate five people, and the other private aviation representatives will nominate six people. The announcement has already been issued yesterday.</p>
<p>Recovering Navigation Rights</p>
<p>The China Navigation Cooperative is the foundation for recovering navigation rights. After the board of directors is established on May 1st, the first tasks to be handled are based on the investigation reports of the specialized committees: (1) adjusting the navigation routes of various routes in the Yangtze River and the sea; (2) balancing the supply and demand of cargo transportation based on tonnage and frequency; (3) realizing the unity and cooperation of state-owned and private aviation; (4) making everything public and permanently eliminating the deceptive and fraudulent fare reductions. Through spiritual cooperation, the aim is to gradually recover the lost navigation rights. This move by the navigation industry is truly an amazing feat, and the future of Chinese ships will be greatly illuminated.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition: Preview Day Fifteen</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd) was the fifteenth day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. Yesterday was Monday, and as usual, visits were suspended in the morning, but the important staff of the association still went to the meeting to work as usual. In the afternoon, it was open as usual from 1:00 PM, and the number of visitors was still crowded, especially students from various schools, because group tickets could be used for admission in the afternoon on Mondays. Mr. Ye Gongchuo has also recently visited the meeting to view the art. Mr. Ye is a calligrapher and painter, so he feels a special and strong interest in calligraphy and painting. The calligraphy and painting exhibited by the association this time includes works by various artists. Some use meticulous brushwork, while others use bold brushwork. Generally, meticulous works are suitable for close viewing, while bold works are suitable for viewing from a distance, and naturally, there is endless interest. For example, the paintings of Wen Zhengming and Qiu Ying are suitable for close viewing. Every blade of grass, every tree, every house, every bridge, figures, mountains, and rivers are extremely meticulous. If you overlook them, it is difficult to appreciate their beauty. For example, Dong Yuan's "Dragon Dwelling Suburban People Picture" and Mi Fu's "Spring Mountain Auspicious Pine Picture" are suitable for viewing from a distance, and you will feel that the atmosphere is majestic, as if thousands of mountains and valleys are all in front of you, and you can appreciate the beauty of nature. Other items such as porcelain and bronze wares are suitable for carefully examining their patterns and quality, comparing the products of different eras. When viewing jade artifacts and cloisonné, you should have an artistic concept. Viewing archaeological examples can evoke memories of the lives of the people in the past. If you browse through these more than 900 antiques once, it will definitely increase your knowledge a lot. Chinese painting is very different from Western painting. Here is Chapter 4 of the "Characteristics of Chinese Painting" and its painting methods written by the association, which will be revealed below.</p>
<p>Characteristics and Painting Methods of Chinese Painting</p>
<p>The above two systems (referring to landscape, figure, and sketch systems) are only for those who specialize in each field. Often, one person is proficient in all three. There is no need to elaborate here. However, Chinese painting can almost completely express the personality, temperament, and interest of the author. This point is necessary for those who study Chinese painting to understand and acknowledge. The reasons for this are: (1) art and life are almost completely integrated; (2) painting methods are completely connected to calligraphy; (3) the tools used and the methods of using them are very subtle, so this result is formed. Chinese painting tools use brushes purely, and there are distinctions between thick and thin, hard and soft. Once a stroke is made, it is no longer changed. Therefore, the wrinkles and dyes in landscapes are different from piling up and decorating, and the strength and interest are contained within them. Although the yin and yang, facing and backing, and various proportions are not very strict, the general outline is not too far off, also because there is an aura that covers and reflects it. Also, when using ink and various colors, in addition to paying special attention to the methods of grinding, blending, and freezing, when using them, it is also due to the order of strokes, the lightness and heaviness of the force, the composition of water and various colors, and the combination of colors, as well as the interaction of the brush, paper (or silk), and color, resulting in brilliance and flavor, thus forming various functions. Therefore, when making paper, silk, pigments, brushes, and painting, special techniques are required for processing paper, silk, and pigments (such as wetting the paper first, mounting the silk first, and using a certain quality of water for mixing colors, etc.). Even the types of brushes are as many as thirty or forty kinds. It is also known to others that in addition to using paper and silk, there are those who paint on buildings and utensils, and there are those who use fingers, tongues, or brushes instead of brushes. In addition, there are fire paintings, iron paintings, paper weaving paintings, and flocked paintings, which should be listed in art and crafts. One more point should be clarified: Chinese painting has its own true face and spirit, but it has also been greatly influenced by foreign cultures throughout history. For example, the transmission of Buddhism, the communication of envoys, and the import of goods and industrial products have all greatly impacted the style of painting, but most of them can be chewed and melted, forming a work with a national color. Therefore, China must be regarded as a giant in the world's painting schools. (There is also a chapter on the outline of the calligraphy and painting exhibits this time, which will be published tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Zheng Tianxi Went to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Former Vice Minister of Judicial Administration, Zheng Tianxi, has now been appointed as the Chinese Special Envoy to the London Art Exhibition.

<h3>National Goods Aid Relief Fair: Manufacturers Drew Their Booth Locations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement Aid Relief Fair at the Penglai Municipal Market has been actively preparing, and everything is ready. Because the opening day (April 26th) is approaching, the association specially convened the first representative assembly of participating manufacturers at the assembly preparation office at No. 4 Yongji Lane, Xizang Road, at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss various pending matters and hold a booth location drawing. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The manufacturers who attended the meeting included Fusheng Factory, Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory, Laotaiyuan, Wusa National Goods Company, Guohua Clothing Factory, Huaxin Underwear Factory, Yongle Cosmetics Factory, Dacheng Cloth Factory, Weiqingxuan Food Factory, Shanghai Fragrance Company, Hongxing Weaving Factory, Yuanchang Leather Goods Factory, Datong Soap Factory, Sanyou Socks Factory, Renchangyong Factory, Minsheng Rubber Factory, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, Lianyi Cosmetics Factory, and more than 150 other companies.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: The assembly publicly elected Liu Zhongying as chairman, Ge Futian as master of ceremonies, and Xu Chengde as recorder. After the ceremony, Chairman Liu Zhongying reported, stating that last year, there was no rain in eastern Zhejiang for several months, and the fields were cracked. It was truly a thousand miles of red land, and the crops were not harvested. The misery of the general disaster victims, crying from hunger and cold, was truly heartbreaking. The hope for the development of our national goods industry originally lies in the countryside, because it is impossible to talk about promoting national goods in this civilized city full of foreign influence. Therefore, if we in the national goods industry need to seek the development of our own future, we must first come to the rescue of the countryside. If the countryside does not recover, national goods will never be able to thrive. If we want to recover the countryside, we should first provide relief to the disaster victims. If we want to provide relief to the disaster victims, we should ask everyone to pay attention to the mission initiated by this association. Now that we have all sponsored and participated, we must earnestly maintain this "Shanghai National Goods Movement Aid Relief Fair" and enable it to achieve excellent results in the end.</p>
<p>Resolutions: The resolutions are as follows: (A) The opening date of the assembly is set for the 26th of this month. Please ratify the public decision. Resolution: Passed. (B) The assembly will have an attached amusement section. Each amusement ticket will cost three cents. Participating manufacturers will receive tickets from the assembly and give them to guests with their goods during business hours. The income from the tickets will be used for disaster relief. Please pass the public decision. Resolution: (1) One cent of the ticket price will be used for amusement expenses, and two cents will be used for disaster relief. (2) The amusement tickets will be issued by the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, which will send staff to be stationed at the assembly to sell them. (C) The invoices for the temporary market should be stipulated to be printed and issued by the assembly to show uniformity. Each book will cost two dimes. Please pass the resolution. Resolution: Passed. (D) The staff of the assembly and the employees of each manufacturer should wear badges to show identification. Resolution: Passed.

(G) Issue a declaration. Resolution: Hand it over to Le Qin, the secretary general of the assembly, to draft.</p>
<p>Temporary Motion: The assembly's funding is insufficient, and most of the participating manufacturers' booth fees are paid with post-dated checks, while the construction costs and the deposit for connecting electricity are very high. How should this be handled? Resolution: Instruct each manufacturer to cash in their checks to maintain the assembly.</p>
<p>Lottery Situation: First, the chairman appointed Leng Bingnan and Zhang Zhifeng as checkers, Fan Tianjin and Liu Mengying as announcers, and Wang Peichen and Liu Chunfan as recorders. There were a total of 172 lottery tickets. The booth locations were drawn one by one on the spot. There were a total of 156 manufacturers. It is said that the assembly's booth construction will be completed by the afternoon of the 24th. On the 25th, participating manufacturers will set up their booths.

<h3>Shanghai Headquarters for Recruitment Team Leaders, Aviation Association Continued to Hire a Large Number of Recruitment Team Leaders Huang Zukang and Others Received Awards for Their Previous Efforts in Recruitment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Headquarters for Recruitment Team Leaders, Aviation Association of China, has started the recruitment work and has hired leaders from all walks of life to be the team leaders for recruitment, with great efforts to expand the recruitment of members and raise funds for aviation to save the country. It is reported that the headquarters yesterday continued to hire leaders from the business community, who are enthusiastic about supporting the aviation to save the country movement, including Lu Feishuchen, Chen Ganqing, Wang Zhengxu, Bao Yaoting, Jian Jinglun, Lu Genquan, Zhu Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Mu Shuzai, Zhou Yuantai, etc., to serve as team leaders from the 421st team to the 430th team. Appointment letters and various recruitment documents have been sent to them, asking them to start the recruitment work immediately to achieve great success. In addition, the headquarters awarded certificates to Huang Zukang and Liu Naizhu, deputy team leaders of the 36th team, for their previous recruitment campaign, assisting team leader Huang Huannan in recruitment and raising more than 1,000 yuan each, to encourage them. The certificates were sent yesterday, and they were asked to continue their enthusiasm and assist team leader Huang in carrying out this recruitment and fundraising campaign. Directly recruiting members from all walks of life, since the headquarters sent letters and advertisements to recruit people from all walks of life in the city, many people have applied to join, and from as far away as Henan, Anhui, and Tianjin, letters have been sent to request copies of the Aviation Association's articles of association and membership applications, more than ten times a day, which shows that the people in various places enthusiastically support the aviation to save the country movement. It is reported that Mr. Cai Yunbin, a salesman from Yufeng Silk Shop in this city, in addition to joining as a member himself, also raised 12 yuan from relatives and friends and returned it to the headquarters for counting yesterday. Mr. Cai's enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Merchants Still Want to Raise Property Circulation Vouchers Yesterday's Meeting Still Produced No Results</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, real estate merchants in this city, such as Cheng Linsheng, proposed to issue 450 million yuan of property circulation vouchers to regulate finance and restore the decline of industry and commerce. Due to difficulties in implementation, preparations have been underway for several months, but no progress has been made. The initiators, Cheng Linsheng and others, held a meeting again at the Silk Cocoon Association on North Shansi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter of raising 450 million yuan of property circulation vouchers. The details of the meeting and the financial community's views on this issue are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Still No Results</p>
<p>For the matter of raising 450 million yuan of property circulation vouchers, real estate merchants such as Cheng Linsheng organized the Commercial Economic Association and elected dozens of people, including Cheng Linsheng and Shen Lianfang, as committee members. At yesterday's meeting, the attending committee members included Cheng Linsheng, Shen Lianfang, Qian Chengxu, Zhou Weishi, Shen Zhifang, Shen Huachen, Zhang Danru, Yu Huancheng, Wang Binyan, Wang Hanliang, Chu Huiseng, Shen Tianxin, and more than 30 others. The meeting lasted for three hours, focusing on discussing the issue of issuing the property circulation vouchers. Since the funds for the circulation vouchers could not be raised, no results were obtained. The committee will continue to hold regular meetings to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Intend to Petition Again</p>
<p>The association previously sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance, but the results were not satisfactory. Therefore, in order to quickly realize its plan, it was decided to send representatives to Beijing again to petition again. The selection of representatives and the date of going to Beijing will be determined soon. The draft of the petition, which is thousands of words long, has also been drafted. The benefits of the property circulation vouchers and the methods of raising them are described in detail in the petition.</p>
<p>Financial Community Observation</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting of the association was extremely secret, and attendance certificates were attached to the notices distributed before the meeting. According to observations by financial giants in this port, the issuance of these property circulation vouchers will definitely not be realized. The reason is very obvious. The issuance of property circulation vouchers is naturally the same as the issuance of banknotes by banks. The issuance of 450 million yuan of property circulation vouchers must have a 60% cash guarantee in order to be trusted. Otherwise, relying solely on the numbers of the property circulation vouchers, not only will people from all walks of life not trust them, but even the issuers of the association will be half-believing and half-doubting each other and unable to bear it. The cash guarantee for the issuance of 450 million yuan of circulation vouchers is 270 million yuan. The silver deposits in various banks in Shanghai are currently only 30 to 40 million yuan. Where will the 270 million yuan be raised from? The current panic in the market and the decline of all industries are also due to the lack of cash. If 470 million yuan can be raised to be used as a cash guarantee for property circulation vouchers, then the issuance of property circulation vouchers would be a superfluous act.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Build a Bronze Statue of Chairman Chiang: All Circles Enthusiastically Participating in the Initiation</h3>
<p>The temporary preparation office for building a bronze statue of Chairman Chiang in various circles of this city has decided to convene the first initiation meeting in mid-May to organize a preparatory committee and discuss all implementation plans. It also plans to stop soliciting initiation work at the end of this month. Yesterday, it has sent a notice to all circles, asking those who wish to participate in the initiation to submit their letters of participation before May 1st. It is learned that well-known people in this port, such as Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Guo Shun, Chu Minyi, Zhang Fakui, Yang Dezhao, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Yizhu, Wu Jingxiong, Zhang Weiru, Jian Yujie, etc., and Shanghai Shishi News, National Jinan University, Shanghai Municipal Martial Arts Hall, and more than ten other groups have successively participated in the initiation. It is now found that there are more than eighty initiating groups and more than sixty initiators.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approved the Chamber of Commerce's Request to Abolish the National Goods Transshipment Tax Now Preparing to Implement It on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a joint letter from the Chinese Paper Mill Federation, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Chinese Industry and Commerce Relief Association, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Promotion Association, and the National Goods Promotion Alliance, requesting the transfer to the Ministry of Finance and the immediate promulgation of the abolition of the national goods transshipment tax to save the precarious industry. After the association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the 3rd of this month, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The original reply is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, I have received the Jiang telegram. Regarding the abolition of the transshipment tax, the Ministry is now supervising its subordinates to prepare for it so that it can be implemented on a regular basis. Please be informed immediately. Official Seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association Provided Relief to the Rickshaw Pullers Affected by the Zhabei Fire Temporarily Distributing Dry Food and Raising Accommodation Sites</h3>
<p>More than 130 households and more than 400 thatched sheds were destroyed in the fire in the Jianbi area between Changan Road and Tongan Lane in Zhabei on the evening of the 20th. Most of the residents here are laborers from Jiangbei. The miserable situation at the time was heartbreaking. The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association specially sent three staff members to the fire scene early the next morning to investigate the truth. It was found that there were more than 50 households of public rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession, with more than 280 men, women, and children. It was necessary to provide assistance. More than 200 material collection certificates were immediately distributed, and in the afternoon, they were concentrated at the general association on East Jiaxing Road, and dry food was distributed according to the certificates. In the evening, Mr. Zhang Dengying, the general director of the association, personally led several staff members to the scene to express their condolences and supplement the relief certificates. The families of the rickshaw pullers in distress were all grateful and thanked them. It is reported that the distribution of dry food has been handled by the branch association in Tailai Lane, Maigen Road, yesterday, as temporary relief, and the association is also actively preparing for the accommodation problem of the victims.</p>
<h3>Entomologist Zhang Juebo Talks About Plant Disease Inspection Our Country's Insect Pest Losses Reach 400 Million Annually</h3>
<p>The famous entomologist Zhang Juebo, director of the Zhejiang Entomology Bureau, came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. A reporter from the National Society specially visited him and asked Mr. Zhang's opinions on plant disease and insect pest inspection. According to him, in recent years, countries around the world have attached great importance to the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. On the one hand, they painstakingly study and eliminate methods and provide practical guidance to farmers. On the other hand, they formulate inspection regulations and implement the inspection of imported and exported plants. The handling is meticulous and the results are remarkable. The direct suppression of the danger of disease and insects at its inception, and the indirect establishment of the guarantee of plant production, its significance is self-evident. However, the inherent diseases and insects in our country have become extremely serious problems that need to be solved urgently.</p>
<p>Annual Losses</p>
<p>The annual losses are always more than 400 million yuan, which is almost six times the annual income of the central government. However, the plants imported from abroad are still not inspected and are freely transported and sold without limit. As a result, the dangerous insects and bacteria from abroad enter at every opportunity. For example, the red bollworm, the cotton scale insect, and the wheat smut disease were all transmitted from overseas and have become quite widespread in recent years, almost everywhere. The harm is so great that it is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. As for the insects and bacteria that have not been imported but have the possibility of being imported, they are also cause for concern. Take the cotton boll weevil and the cabbage clubroot disease as examples. They are extremely rampant in the United States, and farmers suffer great losses. If they are unfortunately transmitted to our country, the future of cotton and vegetable business will be unthinkable. There is also something that cannot be said enough, that is, the severity of diseases and pests imported from other places often exceeds that of the place of origin. This is because the environments of various countries are different and the climates are different. The insects and bacteria in the place of origin are often subject to the restraint of natural enemies and climate, or because the resistance of the host in the local area is strong and cannot be rampant. Once transmitted to a foreign country, the natural balance is lost, and it often leads to major disasters. For example, the grape mildew transmitted from France to the United States and the citrus scale insect transmitted from China to the United States are all clear examples. However, this is only in terms of preventing insects and bacteria from abroad.</p>
<p>Necessity of Inspection</p>
<p>In terms of foreign trade, our country's exported plants have always had no legal authority to inspect and prove the losses suffered over the years, which is even more alarming. Because our farmers are ignorant of the procedures for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, the exported plants often carry dangerous insects and bacteria. Some are completely burned by foreign inspectors, and some are ordered to return to the place of origin. Some even prohibit the import of Chinese plants and plant products directly in order to prevent the spread of diseases and insect pests. This is also an important reason for the sluggishness of our country's foreign trade. It is recently heard that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has launched plant disease and insect pest inspection, which is an essential plan for both the country and the world, which cannot be ignored. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will not regard it as an ordinary problem and ignore it.</p>
<h3>Through Chongming and Hai'an Ships: Prohibition of Sampans Picking Up Passengers, Implemented from the First Day of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-based Ping An, Da Xing, Ju Feng, Da Da, and other companies operating ships to Chongming and Hai'an, due to repeated incidents of sampans vying for passengers, resulting in capsizing and drowning deaths, have now decided that from May 1st, the five ships on the Chongming and Hai'an routes will prohibit sampan passenger pick-up. They have requested the magistrates of the counties of Chongming and Hai'an to issue strict prohibitions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingdian Port Tragedy</p>
<p>The sampan operators in Lingdian Port are exceptionally aggressive, disregarding prohibitions. Last month, sampans competing for passengers led to a full boat capsizing, resulting in the tragic drowning of a large number of passengers. Afterwards, the government and party organizations of the county, together with the five shipping companies, carefully discussed how to handle the aftermath, and are addressing the bereaved families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Sampans Prohibited from Picking Up Passengers</p>
<p>Ping An, Da Xing, Ju Feng, Da Da, and the other five shipping companies, after discussing with the government and party organizations, decided that for future voyages to Chongming and Hai'an, in order to prevent sampan tragedies and safeguard the lives of passengers, it is essential to strictly prohibit the sampan operators at each port from forcibly approaching the ships and competing for passengers. Starting from May 1st, the five shipping companies will uniformly notify each ship to prohibit opening the gangway doors, not allowing sampans to forcibly approach, and requesting the Jinghai naval vessels to strictly investigate and prohibit. If any sampan operators forcibly solicit passengers, they will be immediately detained and dealt with. The companies are also requesting the county magistrates to issue public announcements so that passengers disembark and embark using the ship's large rowing boats.</p>
<p>Requesting County Magistrates to Issue Public Announcements</p>
<p>The five companies sent a special letter to the magistrates of the counties of Chongming and Hai'an, stating that the sampan operators at each port compete for passengers, disregarding the load capacity, causing repeated capsizing. Although many port authorities have complied with previous prohibitions, for the past year, there have also been many who have disregarded the prohibitions. Such as the recent tragic sampan capsize in Lingdian Port, which is due to the aggressive nature of the sampan operators there. The case is still in the process of convening both sides to negotiate a settlement, and it is also planned to order the shipping companies to instruct their crew members not to allow sampans to approach again. If there is any further violation, the crew members should bear full responsibility, etc. Since the government and party organizations aim to ensure passenger safety and incorporate operations into a regular business, the prohibition of sampans competing for passengers should be complied with. However, the sampan operators are exceptionally unreasonable and cannot be reasoned with through words. It is indeed necessary, in addition to the company notifying each ship that starting from May 1st, the gangway doors will not be opened to prohibit sampans from approaching, to request the county government to issue a public announcement of the implementation date, so that passengers will no longer be deceived by sampan operators. If passengers still mistakenly take sampans, resulting in risks, the port police and Jinghai naval vessels should investigate and prohibit it at any time.</p>
<h3>Dozens of Pounds of Large Bomb Explodes: Five Dead, Nine Injured. Trying to Catch Fresh Fish Fails, Instead, a Large Bomb is Discovered. First Throw Does Not Explode, Second Throw Booms and Explodes, Causing this Tragedy.</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at approximately 7:30, near the Dongyue Temple in Jiangwan, a bomb explosion occurred, killing five people and injuring nine. The following is a narrative of the incident. A man named Wang Xiaoquan from Haimen, 22 years old, residing at No. 87 Wan'an Road in Jiangwan, usually worked pulling a small cart. Yesterday evening around 5:00 PM, after Wang Xiaoquan returned home from pulling his cart, feeling tired from the day's work and lacking any side dishes for his wine, he took a basket alone to the riverbank there to catch fresh fish. Unexpectedly, instead of catching fish, he discovered a bomb, over two feet long and weighing dozens of pounds. At that time, Wang Xiaoquan did not know what it was and happily took it home, showing it to his family and neighbors. More than ten people gathered to watch, but several of them recognized it as a bomb and quickly told him what it was. However, Wang Xiaoquan paid no attention and even threw the bomb. The first attempt did not cause it to explode, so he picked it up again and threw it forcefully. Unexpectedly, the bomb exploded, creating an earth-shattering boom. A cloud of smoke filled the air, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. Screams of pain followed. All fifteen bystanders suffered serious injuries. Fortunately, the police officer on duty at the Jiangwan branch quickly arrived after hearing the explosion and urgently telegraphed Branch Chief Dai Hongen, who personally led officers Li Qingxin, Patrol Officer Li Shuchen, Police Chiefs Zhang Huan, Wang Ruiying, Chen Yushan, and the entire team of police officers to the scene to investigate, maintain order, and notify the Zhabei and Jiangwan fire brigades to dispatch all ambulances to the scene to rescue the injured. After the firefighters carried out the injured one by one, it was discovered that four people had been killed instantly: Wang Xiaoquan (the instigator), whose hands and left foot had been blown off; Wang Li, 25 years old, from Jiangwan; Wang Gendi (female), 4 years old, from Jiangwan; and Cao Ximao, 4 years old, from Tongzhou. Another person, Hou Zhiqing, 59 years old, died of his injuries on the way to the hospital, so the total number of deaths was five. There were nine other seriously injured people: Wang Lianfang (male), 51 years old, from Jiangwan; Zhao Asan (male), 49 years old, from Jiangwan; Chen Zhaodi (female), 7 years old, from Haimen; Wang Chen (female), 27 years old, from Jiangwan; Chen Saner (male), 24 years old, from Haimen; Cao Lincai (male), 15 years old, from Jiangwan; Cao Zhu (female), 70 years old, from Haimen; Lu Wang (female), 30 years old, from Tongzhou; and Lu Wang (female), 63 years old, from Tongzhou. Branch Chief Dai Hongen personally escorted them to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, the Binlong Hospital, and the New Zha Road Red Cross branch for treatment. However, because the injuries were severe, it is difficult to predict whether their lives can be saved. As for the five bodies killed by the bomb, Chief Dai ordered the local bailiff to request the court to examine them this morning, and also reported the situation to the headquarters. As for the site of the bomb explosion, a large hole was formed in the ground. Everyone in the vicinity heard the explosion, which shows the explosive power of the bomb. Considering its origin, it was likely left over from the war a few years ago. However, the ignorant people often do not know the dangers and treat them as toys, bringing them home at will, causing major disasters. This has happened frequently. Although it can be said that the disaster was self-inflicted, it is still tragic.</p>
<h3>Wu Fulin's Injury Was Not Caused by Police Officers: The Court Has Already Determined</h3>
<p>Wu Fulin, a native of Jiangbei residing in Xirongqing Lane on Laobosheng Road in West Shanghai, had owed rent for more than thirteen months. The rent collector, Li Zhigang, had repeatedly requested payment without success. On the 15th of last month, he requested the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau to handle the matter. On the afternoon of the 29th, the bureau summoned both parties for questioning. Li Zhigang stated that he was willing not to pursue the rent arrears, and Wu Fulin also agreed to move out within five days. The bureau officials, fearing that he would go back on his word, asked Wu to find a guarantor and temporarily detained him at the bureau. On the morning of the 31st, Wu still had no guarantor. The bureau then asked Wu to sign a guarantee and released him. Unexpectedly, Wu Fulin, incited by someone, sued the local court, claiming that Li had instigated the police to illegally detain and injure him. The prosecutor opened a court to investigate and examine the case. The forensic doctor found that Wu Fulin had more than ten abrasions on his chest from rubbing his skin himself, and the scrape on the back of his left thigh had already scabbed over and peeled off, indicating it was an old scrape. (See the forensic report for details.) These injuries were clearly not caused by being beaten by Li Zhigang and the police. Wu's statements were evasive and contradictory. The prosecutor concluded the investigation and, in accordance with Article 244 of the Criminal Procedure Law, decided not to prosecute. It is now heard that Li Zhigang has already filed a lawsuit with the court against Wu Fulin for false accusation of injury.</p>
<h3>Lou Changqing Pulled a Rickshaw in Violation of Regulations: Police Officer Refused to Accept a Bribe and Reported to the Headquarters for Commendation</h3>
<p>Lou Changqing, a 20-year-old from Yangzhou, residing at No. 26 Yukang Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, worked as a rickshaw puller. Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, Lou Changqing's rickshaw passed the Xinzha Bridge and was spotted by Tan Yaowu, the police officer on duty at Post No. 4 of the Xinzha Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because the rickshaw puller was in violation of the regulations, he grabbed him, intending to take him to the bureau. Lou Changqing offered a six-jiao silver coin as a bribe, asking to be released. The police officer refused and took both the rickshaw puller and the bribe to the bureau. During interrogation, Lou Changqing confessed that he did not understand the rules, so he passed the Xinzha Bridge. "I gave the police officer a small silver coin of six jiao, please forgive me," he said. In addition to fining him two yuan according to law and confiscating the six-jiao bribe, Branch Chief Ruan Kaiki considered the police officer Tan Yaowu to be honest and upright. This was the second time he had refused to accept a bribe, making him a model policeman. He plans to report this to the headquarters for commendation.</p>
<h3>Due to Stepmother's Abuse, a Girl Throws Herself into the Huangpu River: Rescued and Revived</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, a girl was seen on the bank of the North Suzhou Creek in the city, with furrowed brows, tear-stained face, taking advantage of people's inattention to throw herself into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was spotted by a police officer on the patrol boat of the Second Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, who quickly sped over and rescued her, reviving her. They then took her back to the team headquarters. When questioned by the team leader, she said that her name was Li Yinzhu, 11 years old, from Nanjing, living on Haige Road. Her father's name is Li Zhendong, and he currently works in a foreign firm. Her mother died many years ago, and her father married a stepmother, Ms. So-and-so, who is very aggressive and often beats her. This time, she committed suicide because she could no longer bear her stepmother's abuse, etc. It is rare that a child of such a young age and undeveloped mind would know to commit suicide. They enlightened and comforted her, and then prepared a document to send to the bureau for further action.</p>
<h3>Campaign to Revoke Foreman's Permit: Lawsuit for Fraudulent Money: Claiming to Know a Staff Member of the Public Security Bureau and Parading it Around: Trial Opens Yesterday After Prosecutor's Indictment</h3>
<p>The coal transportation work for the South City China Electric Company was previously contracted by Chen Defa and others. Now, a man named Ji Genfa has petitioned the Public Security Bureau to protect the transportation of coal for the China Electric Company and to revoke Chen Defa's permit as a shoulder-carrying foreman, etc. After the petition was approved, mediation was conducted first. There was a dispute at that time. Afterwards, Ji Genfa sued Chen Guansheng in the local court, accusing him of fraud for 400 yuan and requesting a thorough investigation. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu arrested Chen Guansheng, who confessed to the crime. He was indicted in the Criminal Court, stating that the defendant Chen Guansheng, claiming to know a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Mr. Wang, had been boasting about it. On February 21st of this year, Li Genfa, a foreman for the North China Coal Company, because the company had recently signed a new coal purchase contract with the China Electric Company, wanted to have the permit of Chen Defa, the shoulder-carrying foreman used when the China Electric Company purchased coal from the Yitaixing Coal Company, revoked, and wanted to take over the job himself. He knew that this kind of wish would not easily be approved by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, so he consulted Xia Liubao to ask Chen Guansheng, who promised to handle the matter for a handling fee of 400 yuan. Li Genfa borrowed 400 yuan from his relative Cai Guitang and, through Xue Dezhang and Li Yunqi, handed it to Chen Guansheng at the Lequn Inn on Wuma Road, Daxin Street, and obtained a receipt. On the next day, February 22nd, Li Genfa received a bureau notice ("Please wait for mediation"), realizing that he had been deceived. On February 25th of the same month, Li Genfa filed a lawsuit with the court against Chen Guansheng for fraud. The reasons for the indictment and the relevant articles of law are that Chen Guansheng admitted to receiving 400 yuan from Li Genfa and had repeatedly bribed Mr. Wang of the Public Security Bureau, but Mr. Wang refused to accept it. However, based on the testimony of witness Xia Liubao that Chen Guansheng wanted a handling fee of 400 yuan to get the permit, and the testimony of Li Genfa that Chen Guansheng wanted a deposit of 400 yuan, but after handing it over, there was no receipt on the approval, he knew he had been deceived, and the testimony of witness Li Lianqi that Chen Guansheng said he knew Mr. Wang and could guarantee the permit for a deposit of 400 yuan, it is sufficient to prove that Guansheng fraudulently obtained money. Chen Guansheng, intending to illegally possess it for himself, used deception to make others hand over their property, which is clearly a crime under Article 363, Paragraph 1. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke specially opened the Ninth Court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff Li Genfa testified that he was the transportation foreman at the North China Coal Company. When asked why he wanted to revoke Chen Defa's permit, Li replied that he had no right to revoke it. Chen Guansheng said that a deposit of 400 yuan was needed and he could handle it, so he borrowed 400 yuan from relatives and friends and handed it over to Chen Guansheng, but later realized he had been deceived. Next, witnesses Cai Guitang, Xia Liubao, Li Lianqi, and Xue Dezhang testified. Finally, the defendant Chen Guansheng testified that he had taken the 400 yuan, but because Mr. Wang refused to accept it, he returned it to Li Genfa, but Li wanted him to compensate for the loss and refused to accept it back. He had no choice but to take the money home, but it has now been taken away. The rest of his testimony was evasive. The judge ordered the defendant to be detained and remanded for further trial.</p>
<h3>Xie Aqiao's Tragic Death: Suspect Who Discarded Head is Apprehended: Head Had No Flesh, Only Skull Remaining: Suspect Li Guisheng Questioned and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Shao Ting, the owner of the Hongtai Construction Factory in Zhabei, because of his new lover Hou, colluded with Hou in March of the previous year, instigating her son-in-law Shen Fufu and others to kill his former lover Xie Aqiao, dismember the body, and separate the head from the body. The case caused a stir in society when it was discovered. After questioning by the local court, Hou was sentenced to death for conspiring to commit murder, Shao Ting was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder, and to nine years for instigating the abandonment of the body, with a total of thirteen years of imprisonment. Zhou Baoquan and Li Dingsheng were sentenced to one year imprisonment each for jointly abandoning the body. Hou and Shao Ting were not satisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. The local court has already sent the male and female convicts Hou and Shao Ting to Suzhou for trial. It is now learned that Li Guisheng (also known as Liu Guisheng), who assisted in abandoning the body, was also apprehended by the detective team in Zhabei a few days ago and transferred to the local court for questioning. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang questioned him thoroughly and filed charges in the criminal court. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Zhang Shao opened the court. Li Guisheng (also known as Liu Guisheng), 31 years old, from Shanghai, who makes a living selling vegetables, residing at No. 6 next to the Shaoxing Guild Hall on Baoxing Road, was questioned. "Did you dig up Aqiao's head?" The answer was, "I dug it up with Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng." "Who told you to dig it up?" The answer was, "I do not know Gong Shaoting, Li Baosheng introduced me." "Where did you throw the head after digging it up?" The answer was, "I threw it in the Yangzhou burial ground west of the Zhu family's house." "When did you dig it up?" The answer was, "October of the previous year." "How much money did you get?" The answer was, "The three of us got two yuan together." "What did the face of the head look like?" The answer was, "The head had no flesh, only a skull, I could not recognize who it was." Next, Zhou Baoquan, 59 years old, was questioned. "Did Li Guisheng take the head to abandon it?" The answer was, "Yes." Finally, Li Xiansheng, 31 years old, was questioned. "Who exactly abandoned the head?" The answer was, "Li Guisheng." At this point, the judge asked Prosecutor Lei to give his opinion. The judge concluded that the hearing was over and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 27th of this month. Li Guisheng was ordered to be detained pending a decision. Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng were ordered to be sent to the Caohejing Prison to serve their sentences.</p>
<h3>Man's Body Found Shot on Huobi Lan Road: Identified as Zhao Yantang</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, the Jing'an Temple police station received a report stating that a man was lying on the ground in a remote area about 800 yards west of Huobi Lan Road on Lincoln Road. They dispatched Chinese Detective Liu Zhengang and others to investigate. They learned that the man had died and his right chest had been shot. It was also learned that his name was Zhao Yantang, a local resident, 42 years old, residing at No. 51 Dajinjia Lane on Lincoln Road, who worked as a tailor. But why he was shot is unknown, as the murderer has escaped, so it is impossible to find out for a while. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. At around 10:00 AM, Guo Wei, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to Western Chief Detective Weilisiming, and Zhao Lu, 26 years old, a local woman, who claimed to be the wife of the deceased, her husband was a tailor and was peaceful and amicable, she knows that he has no enemies. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, after dinner, he went out from home and did not tell me where he was going. Until 4:00 AM this morning, the police came and reported that my husband had suffered this unfortunate event. Guo, after obtaining the confession, determined that the deceased Zhao Yantang, male, died of a gunshot wound to the chest while he was alive. The body was handed over to his wife, Zhao Lu, who signed a guarantee to take the coffin back for burial. The murderer is being strictly pursued by the police, and the case will be investigated.</p>
<h3>Seeking Wife, Wife Denies: Ji Changcai Has No Choice But to Sue</h3>
<p>Ji Changcai, a 41-year-old from Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, who works as a barber, his wife, Wang, 33 years old, came to Shanghai in 1926 to work as a servant and has not returned home since. He searched everywhere but could not find her. Until recently, he learned that Wang was living with Liu Qingyun (45 years old), a fellow villager, at No. 264 Pushi Road. Ji immediately traveled to Shanghai and found her at the address. Wang denied that he was her husband and knew that she had been living with Liu for six years and had two children. The daughter is six years old this year and the son is four years old, but has died. The two sides argued inconclusively. Ji reported to the police station, but because he did not provide sufficient evidence, they refused to accept the case. Ji then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second District against Liu Qingyun and Ji Wang for disrupting the family, requesting an investigation. The court accepted the lawsuit and Judge Zhang Chaozu opened the court to summon them. Both sides arrived at the court with lawyers. First, the plaintiff Ji Changcai testified that Wang was adopted by his parents when she was young and married when she came of age. She went out in March 1926 and he had been looking for her ever since. The defendant Liu Qingyun testified that in February 1929, he married Wang through the introduction of Wang's sister and his friend Zhang Weibin's wife for the price of 200 yuan. His lawyer presented a red paper receipt. When questioned, Ji Wang testified that her parents died early and she became a beggar. When she was seventeen years old, she was seduced and cohabited with Ji, but they did not get married. Because Ji did not improve, she went out the following year, first to Wuhu to work as a servant, and then came to Shanghai to work. The following year, she returned to her hometown to urge him, but he still did not try to improve, so she came to Shanghai to make a living and never wanted to go back. Later, her elder brother Ji Changfu came out and agreed to break off the relationship with Ji Changcai. She gave 200 yuan to Changfu, who issued a receipt as proof. The plaintiff Ji Changcai also claimed that Wang went out in 1926 and he had only just found her now. He had never been to Shanghai once before. Although Changfu is his elder brother, he does not know where he lives in Shanghai and has not seen him for a long time. The judge also summoned witnesses presented by the defendant. Because the case still needs to be investigated, it was decided to postpone the hearing.</p>
<h3>Qian Guanxian Sues Dahuh Bank Manager for False Accusation</h3>
<p>Qian Guanxian, a native of Ningbo, in February of this year, due to a certain incident, felt that it was difficult to cope with and once avoided seeing people. The business he operated was also stalled at the same time, causing the Dahuh Bank on Nanjing Road, with which he had economic ties, to report to the Laozha Police Station that Qian had falsely established a name and disappeared without a trace, requesting an investigation. The police then arrested Qian and filed a public prosecution according to law. After repeated trials by the First Special District Court, he was found not guilty. Qian believed that the bank's manager Yu Guozhen and business director Wang Honglai should not have acted in this way against him. He has now hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution with the First Court against Yu and Wang for making false accusations, claiming that at that time they were organizing the Shouxiang Money Shop, and because of business competition, the defendants falsely accused him of evading, causing Shouxang to be affected and shut down, and his reputation was further damaged, requesting that Yu and Wang be punished for the crime of false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Criminal Court Eight to try the case. Both defendants failed to appear. According to the defense lawyer they hired, Yu Guozhen is the manager of Dahuh Bank, and the matter in dispute with Qian at the time was handled by Wang Honglai. Yu did not know much about it. Wang Honglai has returned to his native Ningbo to handle funeral affairs, so he specially requested a postponement. Judge Liu then ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of April 27.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Dense Fog in Shanghai Throughout Yesterday; Maritime Traffic Almost Blockaded; Aircraft Delayed, Then Returned.</h3>
<p>Shanghai experienced an unprecedented heavy fog yesterday, with the weather being gloomy and dark throughout the day to an extreme degree. Air and sea transportation were both hindered. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Gloomy All Day</p>
<p>After 9 PM the night before, Shanghai experienced showers. Yesterday morning, the weather was still extremely cloudy. From 6 AM onwards, heavy fog suddenly descended, becoming increasingly dense. By 9 AM, it was difficult to distinguish faces even at close range. The atmospheric pressure dropped sharply, and the ground was extremely humid. Shops had to light lamps to operate, and offices indoors were the same. This type of fog did not dissipate until night.</p>
<p>Extremely Heavy Fog</p>
<p>The entire area of Pudong was shrouded in mist. Small ferries crossing the Huangpu River were threatened by the fog, appearing and disappearing vaguely, as if sailing in the clouds, creating a rather strange sight. At this time, not a single word could be seen on the customs' ship entry and exit boards, indicating that maritime traffic was completely blocked by the heavy fog.</p>
<p>Shipping Obstructed</p>
<p>As of yesterday evening, only a few ships had entered the port, including the Nagasaki Maru and Dalian Maru from overseas routes, and the Jiangtian, Ningshao, Gonghe, and Wusong from the Yangtze River route. Moreover, all were delayed due to the fog. Arrivals were between 3:30 PM and 5:10 PM. Many ships were blocked outside the port. For example, the Zhaoshangju's Haiyan vessel (coming from Hong Kong, expected to arrive in Shanghai at 2 PM) and the Xinming vessel (coming from Tianjin, also expected to arrive in Shanghai at 2 PM). For departures, apart from the Ningshao and Beijing vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, which left port one after the other around 5 PM, it was uncertain whether the Zhaoshangju's Yushun, heading to Xiamen, and the Jiang'an, heading to the Yangtze River, could depart at night.</p>
<p>Aircraft Returns</p>
<p>According to China National Aviation Corporation, the westbound flight on the Shanghai-Hankou route was delayed from 7 AM to 11:10 AM before finally taking off, only to return at 11:40 AM and reschedule for today. The eastbound flight on the Shanghai-Hankou route arrived in Shanghai around 4 PM, also delayed by more than two hours.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Textile Company Replies; Factories No. 2 and No. 5 Resume Operations as Ordered; Negotiations with Banking Syndicate for Further Loans.</h3>
<p>After the Shenxin Textile Company's Factories No. 2 and No. 5 suspended operations, workers from both factories petitioned party and government authorities, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume operations as soon as possible to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau has received an order from the Municipal Government instructing the company to find ways to resume operations immediately. It is reported that the company has been negotiating with a banking syndicate composed of banks such as the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for further loans to facilitate an early resumption of operations, and this has become concrete. Therefore, Rong Zongjing, the general manager of the company, has replied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that he will comply with the order to find ways to resume operations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gas Company to Voluntarily Reduce Prices Starting Next Month.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company has recently adopted a new gas manufacturing method, resulting in lower costs. Furthermore, in order to promote users, it is reported that it has decided to voluntarily implement price reductions starting on May 1st. For example, the previous charge of $2.85 per thousand cubic feet will be reduced to $2.25, a reduction of about 21%. If consumption is below 900 cubic feet, the charge will be only $2.50. Other fees, such as meter installation, will also be slightly reduced.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Urges All Industries to Expedite Fundraising for the Wusong Dredging Project.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to 25 trade associations, including the Northern Goods Industry, Flour Mill Industry, Native Goods Industry, Sugar Industry, and Fresh Fish Industry, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the matter of collecting funds from various industries for the Wusong dredging project, as instructed by the Municipal Government. Two fundraising methods have been proposed: (1) donating a certain amount; (2) collecting a certain amount per unit of goods. We have sent these methods to the relevant industries, asking you to choose one of the two and do your best to raise funds. We have repeatedly sent letters urging those who have not yet responded or have responded but not yet taken action. Now, we find that the amount of funds that various industries have paid or pledged for this project is still far short of the 150,000 yuan agreed upon with the Municipal Government. We have repeatedly reported the difficulties of various industries to the Municipal Government, and we have twice received replies from the Municipal Government urging us to do our best and not to refuse. Judging from the wording of the replies, since the section undertaken by the provincial authorities has already started construction, there is no reason to allow the section dredged by this city to be interrupted. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce cannot simply relay empty words in this matter. Various industries should do their best to raise funds in the hope of seeing the project completed soon. We are sending another letter urging you to discuss and implement this matter quickly, and to promptly reply to the Chamber of Commerce with the amount pledged. Do not delay. This is our earnest hope."</p>
<h3>Hu Maojing, Manager of Xingguang Daily, Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the Newspaper Industry; Simultaneously Purchasing New Rotary Printing Press.</h3>
<p>Hu Maojing, the general manager of the Xiamen Xingguang Daily, recently came to Shanghai on the Dutch postal ship Zibaide to prepare for the newspaper's publication. This reporter met him at the New Shanghai Hotel yesterday and inquired about the purpose of his visit. According to him, the overseas Chinese tycoon Hu Wenhu is very enthusiastic about promoting the newspaper industry. The Xingzhou Daily, which he founded in Singapore in Southeast Asia, is the center of public opinion for the overseas Chinese and holds the authority of the local newspaper industry, which is already known to everyone. After the Min Guo Daily closed down, Hu also purchased its printing press, fonts, etc., to publish the Xingwu Daily. At the same time, he founded the Xinyue and Xingguang newspapers in Guangzhou and Xiamen in China, actively proceeding with all his strength. The site of the Xinyue Daily is under construction, and the Xingguang Daily has purchased a five-story building on Zhongshan Road in Xiamen, and is currently engaged in internal installation. I (Hu referred to himself) came to Shanghai to investigate everything to learn from it, since our newspaper is about to be published and Shanghai is the center of our country's news and cultural industry. I also came to purchase the latest rotary printing press, typecasting machines, copper molds, etc. Yesterday, I was led by Hu Guigeng and Lang Jingshan to visit major newspapers and visit celebrities in the news industry. I will stay in Shanghai for a few more days before returning to Xiamen to prepare for publication.</p>
<h3>Grand Family Picnic of the Telegraph Bureau Club.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau Club of the Ministry of Communications initiated a family picnic for members to enhance the relationship between the members. It was held at the Greater Shanghai Garden in West Shanghai on the 21st of the previous day (Sunday). The director of the bureau, Manager Bao, Chief Engineer Yu, as well as all section chiefs and staff, enthusiastically participated with their families and children. Guests included Shen Shihua, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, Peng Hu, Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, Xu Baiyuan, former Deputy Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Wang Zhijing, Chief Secretary of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Zhang Chengyu, International Radio Station Management Engineer, Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer of Shanghai Telephone, Ge Zhongchao, Secretary of the Purchasing Committee of the Ministry of Communications, and representatives from other agencies, totaling over a thousand people. The weather was pleasant in late spring, and after days of continuous rain, the clouds cleared and the sun shone on that day, which can be said to be the blessing of heaven. The members' children were either playing in the green grass, boating in the clear waters, or chasing in the rockeries and pavilions, truly as if they were in a painting. The joy and harmony of the colleagues can be imagined. The club provided exquisite refreshments to entertain the guests and all family members, and prepared hundreds of toys, distributed to the children. The first prize, a children's car, was donated by Director Bao and Chief Engineer Yu. Every child received a gift, and everyone was very happy. At 3:30 PM, two group photos of all family members were taken to commemorate the occasion. The club's opera troupe temporarily participated in the performance to add to the fun, including Xu Zhen, Zhou Yiyi, and Huang Minchu's "Fish Money," Wang Jintang and Yang Yigen's "Caotun," Pan Shoubai, Gan Shushen, and Wang Yangang's "Kneeling in the Pond," Tang Qi's "Iron Lotus," Wang Jintang's "The Woman Escorted," Zhang Jiaao's "Jidian," Zhang Yuren, Feng Shuqing, and Wang Shannian's "Catching and Releasing Cao," Pan Shoubai and Wang Shushen's "Luohu River," Gu Decheng's "Joining the Army and Leaving the Kiln," Wang Pingshi's "Picking Up Gold," and Lu Zhaoyuan and Jiang Shusan's "Nantianmen." All the performers were experts in their respective fields, and they performed extremely wonderfully. The event did not end until 6:30 PM in the evening, and the club provided many group taxis to send everyone back. The bureau has been actively reorganizing in recent years. In addition to renovating the newsroom with the latest and fastest machines, it has also worked hard to promote the spirit of office work and the health of employees. Judging from the spirit of handling this picnic, it is possible to deduce a general idea.</p>
<h3>Maid Beaten to Death; Husband Comes to Shanghai to Sue; Case Has Been Heard and Awaits Judgment.</h3>
<p>Lin, a rural woman from Hefei, Anhui, who was 45 years old, was working as a maid in Shanghai. On the evening of March 1st, in front of No. 137 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, she was beaten by hooligans Fei Jinhai (nicknamed "Little Rice Cake") and Zhang Xiaomao due to a dispute over pouring sewage. She died the next morning. The French Concession police arrested the two murderers one after another and sent them to the Special First Court for trial. On the 9th of this month, Fei was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Zhang to 7 years, with their civil rights revoked for the same period as their sentences. Later, the deceased's husband, Ni Jishi, received the news in his hometown and came to Shanghai. According to the information provided by his fellow villagers Wang Benyin, Xu Shaoqing, the deceased's little sister Han Sijie, and Sister Wang, namely Chen Wangshi, the death of his wife Lin was actually instigated by Wang Yongwen, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Materials Company at No. 137 Rue Paul Beau, and Chen Guanghan, the owner of Chen Yuanmao Restaurant at No. 135 next door, who colluded with the already arrested and punished Little Rice Cake and Zhang Xiaomao, and the fugitive Little Amei, Bao San, Liang Du, A Xing, and others to beat her to death. Furthermore, the employer Chen Li's family failed to pay wages at the time of her injuries and sent her to the hospital for treatment, which also involved dereliction of duty. Ni hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against the above seven people for instigating injury, abandonment, and causing death, requesting legal investigation and punishment. He also filed a civil lawsuit, jointly seeking damages and compensation for wages of $950 and funeral expenses of $500, totaling $1,450, from Fei and Zhang, who had already been prosecuted and sentenced, and all the defendants in the private prosecution. The Special Second Court's Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened a court hearing and summoned all parties, as detailed in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, the court hearing continued. The plaintiff was still accompanied by his lawyer and the witnesses Wang Benyin, Xu Shaoqing, Han Sijie, and Sister Wang. Of the defendants, Little Amei, Bao San, Liang Du, etc. of No. 1, 2, and 3, etc., were still untraceable, and the summons could not be served. The others, such as A Xing (11 years old, surname Zhang), Wang Yongwen, Chen Guanghan, and Chen Li (employer), etc., appeared in court in response to the summons. The judge briefly questioned both parties and the witnesses, and then summoned the witness, Officer Tian Shiqing, No. 58, of the French Concession Police, who was in charge of the case, to provide testimony. He testified that on the morning of March 2, a resident of the Chungui Lane in Bedier Road came to the police station to report that a corpse had been found abandoned in the lane. I immediately went to investigate with a western detective and saw that the corpse was covered with straw mats. Upon uncovering, the deceased had injuries to the back of the head, and there was blood on the back of her clothes. After repeated inquiries, it was learned that the body had been moved out from the Fangji Introduction Shop next door. I immediately inquired with the shop, and they said that she had been hit and killed by a car. After further investigation, it was learned that her employer and the two women who testified (referring to Han Sijie and Sister Wang) initially said that she had been hit by a car as well. However, since the injuries did not seem to be caused by a car, it was determined that she had been beaten. Then, the two women revealed that she had been beaten and pointed out the murderers Little Rice Cake, Zhang Xiaomao, and Shi Bao San, etc. The women in the introduction shop who moved the body, Fang Lin's family and Luo Geng's family, were also detained. Later, the murderers were apprehended. After investigation, since there was no evidence against Shi Bao San, he was released. The murderers Fei and Zhang, and the Lin and Geng families were sent to the court for trial. Initially, no one reported that the defendants in the case were at the scene instigating and helping the crime. The judge then ordered Tian to file the testimony for the record, and then ordered the attorneys to make their arguments. The court then adjourned the hearing and announced that the judgment would be pronounced at a later date. The defendants left to await the announcement.</p>

<h3>The Final Day of the Reading Movement: Director Pan Broadcasts Closing Remarks, The Purpose of the Reading Movement is to Build a New China, the Reading Movement Should Expand Space and Extend Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the National Reading Movement Conference organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. Director Pan Gongzhan, Secretary-General of the Association, broadcast the closing remarks of the National Reading Movement Conference from the China-West Radio Station. The Association has been inviting scholars and celebrities to give academic system broadcasts and lectures for days, which has attracted much attention and welcome from the academic community. The Association plans to ask the speakers to supplement and revise the recorded manuscripts and publish them in the Cultural Construction Monthly to meet the needs of readers nationwide. The full text of Pan's closing remarks is as follows: Gentlemen, today is the last day of the National Reading Movement Conference organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. I am responsible for giving the closing remarks. The Reading Movement Conference has now officially concluded, but the Reading Movement will definitely not end with the closing of the conference. This point should be noted by our compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of this National Reading Movement Conference organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, Mr. Chen Lifu, Chairman of the Association, gave a detailed report on "National Revival and Reading Movement" in Nanjing on the Central Broadcasting Station. The speech has been published in major newspapers across the country, and I need not repeat it. The "Relationship between Cultural Construction and Reading Movement" was also discussed in detail by Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Vice-Chairman of the Association, on April 15. The connection between the Reading Movement and the Chinese Revolution was also discussed with you by Mr. Wu Xingya, Standing Director of the Association, on April 8. As for the methods of reading, the attitude that should be taken in researching various academic disciplines, and the methods that should be adopted, succinct instructions were given by academic celebrities such as Cai Yuanpei and Wang Yunwu. The original texts of the speeches have been published in major newspapers. After young people across the country have heard or read the famous sayings and theories of these gentlemen, I deeply believe that those who have no interest in reading will definitely be inspired to make a determined effort to study academic disciplines, and those who have an interest in reading will definitely be able to strengthen their confidence in academic research. Therefore, the significance of the Reading Movement Conference lies in arousing the determination and confidence of young people across the country in reading, and in arousing a firm motive for reading. Therefore, although the conference ended according to the scheduled date, I deeply believe that the interest of our compatriots across the country in reading and the determination to study academic disciplines will be stimulated and become more determined as a result of the closing of the conference. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on the Reading Movement, hoping that young people across the country will pay attention and all sectors of society will give guidance. We all feel that the Chinese nation has reached a critical moment of life and death. Whether we can recover from this crisis depends entirely on whether we are able to diagnose and treat the Chinese patient correctly and whether we are able to recuperate appropriately. Assuming that we can diagnose and treat the patient properly and recuperate appropriately, then the patient will undoubtedly recover. Perhaps we will be even stronger than before. Assuming that the diagnosis, treatment, and recuperation are not appropriate, it is possible that the disease will become critical and lead to death. Post-revolutionary China is like a pregnant woman giving birth. The difficulty and hardship of the revolution and its impact on the social, political, and economic aspects of the country are far greater than the difficulty of childbirth for a pregnant woman. Post-revolutionary China is also like the weak body of a pregnant woman after childbirth, which is in a very dangerous period. The death of a pregnant woman is often due to improper postpartum care. There are two major stages of revolution: destruction and construction. Destruction is analogous to childbirth for a pregnant woman, and construction is analogous to postpartum care. We have initiated the revolution in order to accelerate the progress of society, politics, and economy. This revolutionary movement has destroyed all outdated and corrupt social, political, and economic systems. After that, we must build a sound and rational social, political, and economic system. Assuming that there is only destruction and no construction, it is like a pregnant woman who only knows how to give birth but does not know how to take care of herself, who only knows how to give birth but does not know how to raise her child. If a pregnant woman gives birth but does not know how to take care of herself and raise her child, both the mother and the child will be in danger. If we only know how to revolt but do not know how to build, not only will the revolution fail, but there will also be the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. Therefore, in the current stage of China, the work of destruction has been largely completed. Today, the only thing needed is a vigorous construction movement. When it comes to construction, we need construction materials, construction personnel, and construction methods. Without construction materials, personnel, and methods, how can construction be completed? Construction materials need to be obtained by specialists and technicians. Construction personnel need to be trained by specialists and technicians. We need intelligence. Despite having five-year plans and ten-year plans, if there are no construction materials and personnel, it is still just empty talk. The need for intelligence is so urgent, then cultivating intelligence and enriching intelligence is of course the only urgent task today. From this, we can see the urgency and need for the Reading Movement in the current stage of the Chinese Revolution. Therefore, the current Chinese Reading Movement is a construction-oriented Reading Movement. It is a Reading Movement that aims to build a new China. If young people still only know how to destroy but do not know how to build, just like pregnant women who only know how to give birth but do not know how to take care of themselves, who only know how to give birth but do not know how to raise their children, then it is equally dangerous. Not only will young people themselves go astray and ruin their lives, but the nation will also suffer a major blow. The entire revolutionary movement will inevitably lead to failure. The Reading Movement at the current stage is a construction-oriented Reading Movement. This is the first point that I hope everyone will deeply understand and pay serious attention to. Secondly, what I just said seems to focus more on specialized research. On the one hand, we need to cultivate many experts to build a new China. This refers to the general youth who have received education or are receiving education, and train themselves to become leading personnel in building a new China. This is of course what China urgently needs. However, while cultivating specialized talents, we cannot ignore the majority of the ignorant and illiterate. Assuming that China's vast illiterate population is not eliminated and more than 80% of the people do not have the opportunity to receive education, then China's revolution will still not be completed, and China's construction cause will still be hampered by many obstacles. Our country has 470 million compatriots. Even if we say that China's illiterate population is less than 80%, it is at least 70%. Even with 70%, there are 329 million illiterate people who are excluded from the circle of knowledge. How can China's construction cause be completed if this vast illiterate population is abandoned? For example, in architecture, if the foundation is not strong, the achievement will be small. Therefore, on the one hand, we must cultivate many young people who are in school and who have received education to become specialists. At the same time, we must eliminate China's vast illiterate population. I firmly believe that among this vast illiterate population, once they have received literacy education, there will definitely be many outstanding talents who can be discovered and serve the people and the country. Now, the central government and the provincial and municipal governments are all committed to eliminating the literacy movement. I hope that all members of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association and comrades across the country will participate in this great movement to eliminate illiteracy. We must know that eliminating illiteracy is also the second key point of our Reading Movement. Thirdly, what I mentioned earlier is that the purpose of the Reading Movement is construction, and the second point is that the Reading Movement should eliminate illiteracy and expand space. The third point is that the Reading Movement should extend the time and have permanence. As I said earlier, the significance of the Reading Movement Conference lies in arousing the public's motivation and interest in reading, and in awakening the public to the importance of reading in the current stage of the Chinese Revolution. Therefore, after the motivation and interest have been aroused and the importance of the Reading Movement has been understood, although the conference has ended, we should develop a good and lasting habit of reading, which is an important task. The four basic needs of life are clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. I hope that in the future, it can become clothing, food, shelter, transportation, and reading, and regard reading as an indispensable daily necessity of life, just like clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. No matter how busy a person is at work, they should set aside one hour, two hours, or three hours a day to read. Young people who are in school should especially strive to work hard and study diligently, and be determined to create themselves into important leading personnel for building a new China. The Reading Movement should be a lasting movement, and reading should become one of the daily needs of every citizen. This is the third key point of the Reading Movement. After many gentlemen have troubled themselves to give us many instructions on the methods and attitudes of studying academic disciplines, I offer the above three points of view on the day of the closing of the conference, hoping that comrades across the country will deeply understand, put them into practice, and give corrections. The end.</p>

<h3>Social Education Society Holds Get-Together, Over a Hundred Members and Guests Attend</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Social Education Society has spared no effort in promoting social education. Last night, the society held a members' get-together and dinner at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Over 150 people attended, including directors and supervisors Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Gongsu, Zheng Zhengqiu, Chen Jicheng, Ding Nianxian, Lü Hailan, Chen Songchun, Yuan Zengyu, Wang Keyong, Ma Chonggan, Zhou Shang, Shen Xiangrui, Jin Zaizhi; honorary director Yu Hongjun; and members Zeng Shengdian, Hu Zongfan, Shen Jiesheng, Sun Yucai, Chen Dongbai, Zhu Zhiming, as well as guests Jiang Kanghu, Professor Wu Shuban of Beiping Women's Normal University, and Liang Jixian, director of the Kunming County Education Bureau of Yunnan.

<h3>Tai Shuangqiu Speaks on People's Livelihood Education</h3>
<p>This semester, Great China University in this city has established a lecture series on national salvation, inviting celebrities to give lectures from time to time. The other day, the university invited He Shuangqiu, the dean of the School of Education, to speak on people's livelihood education. The gist of Tai's speech was that the fundamental problem in China is the problem of people's livelihood. The current rural education, mass education, and production education in China all fail to emphasize people's livelihood. Therefore, he advocated promoting people's livelihood-based education (in short, people's livelihood education) with the development of people's economic activities as the backbone, to improve people's lives, support social survival, protect the lives of the masses, and achieve the goal of people's prosperity and recovery. As for the method of solving the problem of people's livelihood, Tai advocated using industry to enrich agriculture, integrating industry into agriculture, maintaining the inherent manual production, improving it, and gradually developing it into cooperative small-scale machine crafts, spreading them in China's rural areas. Finally, Tai also said that if we want to help the countryside, the fundamental plan is to promote the use of local products produced in the countryside, especially hand-spun and hand-woven local cloth. Local products should enter the city, not national products go to the countryside. Entrepreneurs should go to the countryside to promote cooperative crafts, and should not suck the money from the countryside into the city to open factories, making rural finance exhausted. He's discussion was eloquent and thorough, and the audience applauded thunderously.

<h3>Results of Yesterday's Middle School Basketball Game; Provincial Shanghai High School Wins Over Minli 36-34; Peidong Wins Over Fushi 51-33</h3>
<p>There were two Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation basketball league games yesterday. (1) Provincial Shanghai High School won over Minli with 36 to 34. (2) Peidong defeated Fushi with 51 to 33. Provincial Shanghai High School and Minli were evenly matched, and the game was unusually tense. In the first half, Minli took the lead with 17 to 16 by one point. In the second half, the two sides did not give way to each other at 33 to 22. In the last five seconds, Peng Peifeng made a long shot, which sealed the game. It can be said that it was dangerous. Peidong failed once due to an unfavorable first start, so the schools did not pay much attention. Therefore, yesterday, when they met Fushi, the strongest in the group, they thought it was insignificant. Unexpectedly, the game was full of wonderful performances and won a lot of applause from the audience, especially the forwards Wen Xian, Zhang Fuyuan, and Zhang Fuyuan, whose performances were unusually magical, causing the defenders to be unable to resist. The short and strong guard Yang Shiyu ran all over the field and made great contributions. The inside and outside responded to each other, and the game was colorful and always in the lead. They won 17 to 17 in the first half and 20 to 16 in the second half. Now the group competition has ended. The Peidong Provincial Shanghai High School and Fushi three schools originally had equal points. Because Fushi voluntarily withdrew, only the Peidong and Provincial Shanghai High School have been decided by the Basketball Committee to hold another game at 3:00 PM this Wednesday to determine the final qualification. This afternoon, there will be two games with the character "Zhong" (中), among which the game between Guanghua and Zhizhi is related to the gain and loss of the championship and will definitely be a fierce battle. The order for today and the results of yesterday's games are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Individual Track and Field Promotion Association</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Association Affairs The China Individual Track and Field Competition Promotion Association has attracted much attention from the community since its establishment in November of last year. Now, Jinan, Nanchang, and other places have successively organized individual sports events. Now, in order to actively carry out its work, the association has decided to host the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Meet on May 26, and at the same time invite the sports and news circles in Shanghai to hold a get-together. It is also scheduled to host the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai four-province/city long-distance running championship in June. Generalissimo Jiang specially donated 200 yuan to the association for this municipal track and field meet.</p>
<p>Source of Funds As for the economic source of the association, it has been established for half a year and has received the strong support of various circles. Generalissimo Jiang donated 200 yuan, Dean Wang donated 20 yuan, Minister Zhu donated 100 yuan, Minister of Cadres 100 yuan, Zhang Hanqing 40 yuan, Mayor Wu 40 yuan, Cheng Yize 19 yuan, Xue Xuehai 18 yuan, Xu Zhiyi 10 yuan, Ruan Weicun 100 yuan, and membership fee income was 105.3 yuan. In total, from November 1 of last year to the 20th of this month, the total revenue item was 702.3 yuan. The expenditure items are divided into five categories, totaling 498.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Municipal Field Manager Since its establishment, the association has hosted more than 20 sports events, large and small, with nearly 2,000 participants, making it a powerful organization for promoting mass sports. This time, the association will host the Municipal Track and Field Meet in Shen Garden and has received a large number of prizes from President Chen of the Central Bank, Supervisor Tang of the Jianghai Customs, Tianchu, Land Bureau, Commercial Press, and China.</p>
<p>Statement of Errors When the association released the news a few days ago, two errors occurred. (1) The association omitted the 10,000-meter event in the competition program. Also, the association's invitation to Shao Rugan to serve as the general manager is the general manager of the Municipal Track and Field Meet, not the general manager of the Individual Track and Field Meet. As for the public letters that the association distributed to the schools a few days ago to solicit participation, this kind of error occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Rugan's Statement</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Shao yesterday saying that the China Individual Track and Field Competition Promotion Association plans to hold the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Sports Meet in Shen Garden on May 26. The organizer invited me to serve as the general manager. Rugan had verbally agreed to assist. It is now found that in the association's recent external documents, in addition to the association's stamp, there is also a wooden stamp of the words "General Manager Shao Mou" co-signed. Without my prior consent, I am afraid there will be misunderstandings. I hereby declare. Shao Rugan, April 22.</p>

<h3>My Philosophy on Officiating Basketball (I)</h3>
<p>— Written by American J. Dahl, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>This article, written by the famous American basketball referee J. Dahl, was published in the American sports monthly in February of this year. Its ideas are fresh, and its theories are detailed and precise. It is translated here as a reference for us. - The Translator</p>
<p>First and foremost, the author wants to make it clear to the reader that he has no intention of teaching others how to act as a basketball referee. He firmly believes that this is not an easy task. A refereeing method that works for one person may be the opposite for another, rendering them useless. Although there are indeed fixed rules to follow in terms of mechanical procedures, each referee should strive to develop their own personality and skills. All of this can only be achieved through diligent work and practice. No referee or school of referees should try to instill their particular personality and skills into others.</p>
<p>It must be reiterated that this article is not intended to be followed literally by the reader. It should be understood that the material in this article is merely an expression of the author's sincere thoughts, as he has a great interest in basketball games and officiating.</p>
<p>The author would be most fortunate if the reader agrees with some or all of these views. If not, disagreement is only natural and nothing to be surprised about, as differing opinions are an element that drives the world forward.</p>
<p>To become a successful and outstanding referee, it must come from hard work and practice, as mentioned earlier. Here is a golden rule for those who aspire to be successful and well-known referees: "Call the game as you see it, without bias, without fear, and in accordance with the rules."</p>
<p>Criticism is Inevitable. It is inevitable for referees to be criticized, and this is the first thing that anyone acting as a referee must know. It is extremely rare for a referee to receive praise from all sides after a game. If the enforcement is strict, it is bound to draw criticism from some. If it is too lenient, it will surely be met with backlash from others. Even if the enforcement is selfless and fearless, harsh criticism is unavoidable. Even if judgments are made according to the psychology of the audience, players, or coaches, it is impossible to avoid criticism. Therefore, no matter how one officiates, there will always be critics.</p>
<p>If a referee is negligent during a rough game, protests from the players will pour in, not to mention the criticism from coaches and spectators. If someone thinks there are too many free throws, they will definitely be criticized. Even people associated with a team may want the referee to be lenient if their team has large players, but then ask for strict enforcement if their players are smaller the following season, which is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the only safe method for a referee is to "call it as you see it, according to the rules." Only in this way can one be sure of being correct despite the criticism, and have a clear conscience. Conversely, if a referee is lenient, they will know they have been negligent when criticism arrives and will have no ground to stand on. However, no matter how one officiates, criticism is unavoidable. Those who are referees should get used to it.</p>
<p>The rules are set by the rules committee to enhance skills (such as passing and shooting) and to avoid the rough play of basketball games of the past. Although some people believe that basketball games are getting worse, this is only the view of a very small minority. As far as the author knows, millions of players (old or young), coaches, and spectators do not think so. Upon thorough investigation, coaches or players (and even spectators) prefer games that are officiated according to the spirit of the rules to those that are officiated leniently, as they are much more interesting.</p>
<p>The author has personally experienced the following: In one game, the two teams were fierce rivals, and conflict was unavoidable. However, the referees were quite surprised during the game because, although the competition was intense, it was quite clean. What was even more surprising was that after the game, the captain of one of the teams (which was known for being rough) said to the referee, "The game was good tonight, thanks to your efforts." The referee replied, "I don't know about that, maybe it's because your game was so clean that we didn't have much to do." The captain then made a surprising reply: "Let me tell you, the coach told us to try our best to play ball tonight, so we forgot to hit people."</p>
<p>There is more to say. Sometimes, after a clean game, a few spectators may come to the referees to express their appreciation for the good officiating. If the game is rough, someone will definitely come forward after the game to say harsh words, claiming that the referee was a terrible performer. In fact, refereeing is easy in clean games because both sides have good skills. Knowing this, it is clear that a referee in a rough game will not receive good reviews even if they do their best.</p>
<p>Different Perspectives. From another perspective, the referee announces the game from their personal point of view, while the audience and coaches each have their own different perspectives and angles, so what they see will inevitably be different. What appears to be an obvious foul from one angle may not be so from another. Therefore, what the referee sees in a game is one thing, and what the audience sees from the sidelines is another. The reason for this is very clear. If the referee were seated on the sidelines, they would see everything the audience sees, but that is impossible. This reason is particularly true in situations where a dribbling player comes into contact with a defending player.</p>
<p>Of course, many fouls are obvious from all angles, and the audience's judgment is just as good as the referee's. If the referee easily overlooks these obvious fouls at this time, they are only asking for trouble. One more point must be mentioned. It has been heard that referees say, "My officiating depends on the game situation and the coaches' requests. If they like strict, I'm strict; if they like lenient, I'm lenient." The author once heard a referee ask a coach, "How would you like me to officiate tonight, strict or lenient?" This is not the author's intention to nitpick or enjoy commenting on other people's refereeing methods, as it is none of my business. The reason for giving this as an example is that I am deeply afraid that this kind of approach is harmful. The provisions for fouls in the rules are actually to promote the improvement of skills. This definition and the interpretations contained after the rules are very clear. If a referee can make another interpretation, then the responsibility they bear is too heavy. If they can implement the rules as stipulated by the rules committee, they will definitely get good results.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Xin-quan)</p>
<p>If there were two envelopes, one made of domestic paper requiring one copper coin, and one made of foreign paper requiring only five cash, then I dare say, "Everyone would know to choose the cheaper one, without even considering foreign or domestic goods!" I remember Mr. Chen Bulei once said, "To promote domestic goods, one must have some foolishness and some courage to reap the benefits." This is truly well said!</p>
<p>"The number of literate people is greatly related to the strength of a country." This is something no one can deny. Therefore, in recent years, literacy campaigns have been launched everywhere, with widespread publicity to encourage the public to become literate. Although the tools they use for publicity include performances, speeches, etc., posting slogans is also considered an important task. Phrases like "Illiterate people are blind" are almost everywhere. However, I think "to use words to persuade illiterate people is somewhat contradictory, isn't it?"</p>
<h3>Swallow</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shao-fei</p>
<p>One morning, after a spring slumber, when I woke up, the sun was already high in the sky. A murmur of singing reached my ears. The swallows had arrived! Feeling joyful, I excitedly strolled to the hall to welcome them.</p>
<p>Watching their scissor-like wings, they flew in pairs, sometimes swirling inside the hall, sometimes flying outside the patio wall.</p>
<p>Because I was so fond of swallows, out of loving care, I moved a ladder and nailed two nails onto the beams for them to perch on and build their nest, and hung a bamboo basket underneath to catch the droppings. The nails were for them to lean on while building their nest, and the basket was to catch the droppings that would fall.</p>
<p>Every day, I would remember to stroll over there and stare at them once or twice. They were diligently carrying mud mixed with bits of rice straw to build their nest. I noticed how difficult it was for them to carry the mud, probably because the mud was sticky, but this mud could only be found on the distant shores of Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Watching them carry the mud, the damp mud nest gradually dried, and only then did their nest-building project come to an end.</p>
<p>There were probably eggs in the nest. Hearing my footsteps, a swallow sitting in the nest poked its head out, glanced at me, and then quietly retreated back inside.</p>
<p>Thinking back to my childhood, when I knew the swallows were hiding inside, it meant they were incubating eggs. I would always steal the eggs to play with. When my mom saw me, she would always scare me by saying, "Taking swallow eggs will cause you to get swallow sores." But I was not afraid. Once the egg was in my hand, I would break it and be done with it. And I didn't care about the anxious state of the old swallow after losing its egg, endlessly calling out in the hall. Now, I think it was too cruel, and I can't bring myself to do it anymore. Let them hatch their lovely baby swallows.</p>
<h3>Small Habits</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>I have a habit recently of paying attention to my friends' small habits.</p>
<p>My supervisor, Mr. Sun, is very young. His chin is shaved clean every day, but he can't say three sentences without touching his chin with his hand.</p>
<p>My colleague, Lao Li, has a habit of scratching his scalp. While talking to people, he often uses the ring finger of his right hand to scratch his scalp, and always exactly twice.</p>
<p>There is also a colleague, Lao Chen, who always lifts the hem of his long gown with his left hand when standing. This and his younger brother, Xiao Chen, who wears a suit, constantly unbuttons and buttons his coat buttons when talking to people, can be said to be a perfect match, with different tunes but the same effect.</p>
<p>A-Liang, also a colleague, often twitches the outer corner of his right eye and the right corner of his mouth up and down when talking to people, as if making eyes at them. But when no one is talking to him, his eye corners and mouth corners remain still and motionless.</p>
<p>Secretary Ms. Hu often wraps a small handkerchief around the ring finger of her right hand. When she sits alone thinking, she wraps the handkerchief around her finger so much. When talking to people, she wraps the handkerchief around her finger so much. Sometimes I sit with her on a tram going back, and I see her wrapping the handkerchief around her finger there too.</p>
<p>Ms. Liu, also a colleague, doesn't have lung disease, but always makes a light cough or two when speaking. When she is not speaking, the coughing also stops.</p>
<p>These small habits don't seem to be worth paying attention to, but if you pay attention once or twice, you will find it very funny the next time you see these expressions.</p>
<h3>The Destination of the New Woman</h3>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, She Curtains Herself Off from Guests; Diligently Saves Lamp Oil, She Copies Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Yueying was quite thirsty, so she reached her arm out from the tent door to take the teacup inside. After drinking, she again sent the cup out with her arm. The two arms, going in and out of the tent door, prevented Beihai from focusing on his books, and he kept gazing at the tent. He said, "It's not a good solution for you to sleep on Mr. Cheng's bed all the time. You should urge your family to bring you clothes to change as soon as possible." Yueying said, "Where would I have clothes to change? My aunt took the wet clothes to bake dry. Once they are dry, she will naturally bring them." Beihai said, "The last time I saw you wearing clothes, the style was very new. Do you only have that one set?" Yueying said, "Those clothes were borrowed from the servants here." Beihai said, "If they were borrowed from the servants here, then you originally had a set of clothes?" Yueying said, "Those clothes were also given to our three generations by a high-ranking official we met in Pingliang while coming from the West. The clothes I was originally wearing were too torn to wear." She mentioned coming from the West, which touched Beihai's concerns, because there were many questions he was wondering about, and today was a good time to ask. He said, "I've been thinking about something. Miss Zhu, you lived well in Gansu, so why did you come here?" Yueying said, "It's just that we couldn't make a living. A family of three generations, all women, what kind of outcome is that? We heard that our uncle was performing opera in Xi'an, so we came here, but we didn't expect that our uncle had been dead for a long time." Beihai said, "An opera singer's monthly earnings are also very limited. Even if he were still alive, I don't think he could support a family of three like you." (188)</p>
<h3>The Scent of Incense Lingers</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>All other distractions ceased to exist because of their dedication to their duties! So what would be the fate of these women when they grew old? It was, of course, different from that of ordinary old people! By the time they gradually grew old! Probably no more than forty or fifty years old, because the art of embroidery was extremely exhausting and most likely to cause aging! When their eyesight was no longer sufficient to do such fine embroidery work, naturally, new people would come in to replace them, allowing them to stay in the palace and retire, from then on they would no longer be active, simply eating and wearing clothes, lazing around until they passed away peacefully. I think they all had a traditional concept that when they were young and strong and could work as hard as possible, they would devote all their efforts to this beautiful craft; and when they grew old, they would rely on these achievements to live a comfortable life eating free meals in the palace.</p>
<p>Is this concept right? Is it reasonable? Is it beneficial to them? Of course, I cannot answer for them; I cannot even explain why they held this traditional concept. I think unless I had the same skillful hands as them, and constantly embroidered flowers on those satin tributes, and experienced it firsthand, perhaps I would be able to understand the real reason; now, it is absolutely impossible to figure it out by merely imagining!</p>
<p>Didn't I say above that there were four or five shoe patterns outlined on each piece of satin tribute; after they put this piece of satin tribute on the embroidery frame, they would embroider them one by one from top to bottom. (298)</p>
<h3>The Life of a Rich Man</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>I have a friend who is a private tutor in a rich man's home. From my friend, I learned about some interesting snippets of this rich man's life.</p>
<p>This rich man is only in his forties and is the owner of a Heng-character numbered Qian Zhuang (old style bank), two large pawnshops, and a department store with a double-wide storefront. In addition, he naturally has shares in many large businesses. It is said that his movable and immovable property amounts to more than three million, so his concerns are not about the prosperity or decline of his business, but about the arrival of kidnappers.</p>
<p>He was kidnapped once four years ago. Since then, he has specially hired two Russian and four local bodyguards. They are divided into two shifts, patrolling the residence day and night. He usually doesn't go out, lying on his opium bed all day and night. Even when he has to go out, he is protected by at least three bodyguards.</p>
<p>Therefore, his two sons and one daughter do not attend school, for fear of accidents on the way. But to be a tutor in his home, in addition to providing a guarantor when hired, you must also be searched by the bodyguards every day before entering his home. To be a driver, servant, or even a maid in his house, you must have two reliable guarantors.</p>
<p>The windows in his house are never opened throughout the year. The gardens around the residence are also densely covered with barbed wire. Anyone who wants to see him must be interrogated in detail by the accountant in his house, just like a trial. Even my friend, who has been teaching in his house for more than two years, has not seen the owner more than ten times.</p>
<p>Alas, I don't think this kind of life is very enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News from the Yokohama Exposition (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The Manchurian and Korean products are displayed as specimens. The annual output of cotton, soybeans, ginseng, and coal and iron ore is in the millions. Due to inconvenient transportation, there are very few products on display. The Siamese Pavilion has snake skins, cow horns, and various grains of rice. The grain is slender and different from our country's, and is often imported to Japan in large quantities. The silver carvings have an ancient Egyptian style that is unmatched by Japan.</p>
<p>Hokkaido produces bears and wood. Farmers in the Yagumo area carve bear statues out of brown wood blocks, with each one priced as high as fifteen yuan. Whether it is a bookend, book clip, or stationery, they are all attached with bear images, and the carving of bears has become their specialized local art. Nara clay figurines are very famous, all made by hand without using machines. The Japanese female figurines they make are exceptionally exquisite, and the colors applied are bright and delicate, surpassing Huishan in Wuxi. There is a statue of Bai Letian, with a solemn and dignified appearance, carved with great precision, but priced at fifteen yuan. China does not have such expensive clay figurines.</p>
<p>Japanese woodwork is more developed than our country's. A single piece of wood can be made into various utensils. The walls of the Hokkaido Wood Specimen Hall are made of thin slices woven into diagonal grids, which is very interesting. Japanese architecture makes flat-roofed houses very quickly. After the wooden frame is erected, reed curtains are used as walls, and some mud ash is applied. Then, a few pieces of paper are pasted, and a mat is laid, and a very beautiful house is built in less than two days. The buildings at the exposition are all of this type, so while some are still being built, some are already damaged. Utilizing waste materials, reducing costs, and having modern styles that cater to people's psychology are the only reasons why Japanese handicrafts sell well. For example, cufflinks for suits are made of crystal, amber, tortoiseshell, gemstones, and pearls. They are all set in alloy, so each piece is only two or three yuan. There are also man-made ones that are only two or three jiao apiece, which can be passed off as genuine. The colors and patterns of glassware are also exceptionally exquisite. Because they have competitions for everything, they all think to the extreme in the hope of defeating others.</p>
<p>Women do not have a high status in Japanese society. But because they are gentle and meticulous, large companies, food stores, and transportation agencies all hire women as clerks, waitresses, and in sales. Female employees make up an even larger number at the exhibition, so now in Japan's workforce, there is already a phenomenon of women replacing men. In addition, Japanese housework is all done by women. Besides working at home, they also have to go out and buy everything. There are also more female visitors at the exhibition than men. We have jokingly called modern Japan a world of women.</p>

<h3>Finance: The End of April is Approaching; Tongtai Zhuang Follows Yongxing into Liquidation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign market situation, superficially, remained the same, but looking at its inner workings, with the end of April approaching, and the talk of accommodating transfers on the income side, people cannot be forced to pay. On the payout side, due to credit relations, one has to reluctantly pay. The difference between inflows and outflows is huge. Yongxing had already collapsed earlier, and yesterday, Tongtai Shun Ji followed suit. Fortunately, the bills of exchange of this Zhuang have no close relationship with other parties, so it will not affect the market. Yesterday, the discount rate in the market was one jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets. The overnight interest rate still opened at three fen, which was no different from the past few days. In the morning market, bill of exchange transactions amounted to over 3.5 million, and new transactions amounted to over 300,000. In the afternoon market, transactions amounted to over 300,000. Transactions in the small general association amounted to over 700,000. Foreign collateral transactions amounted to 700,000 for redemption and 900,000 for new loans. Currency redemption was 900,000. On the disbursement side, circulating notes were over 800,000, unmarked notes were over 1.2 million, remittances from various routes were over 500,000, customer source was 400,000, and withdrawal was 500,000. As for the bank's revenue and disbursement news, foreign banks took another holiday yesterday because the previous day was a Sunday. Chinese banks' revenue and disbursement of notes amounted to over 2.6 million, and various goods exchange and other miscellaneous revenue and disbursements amounted to over 4.4 million. Withdrawals were 300,000. Revenue and disbursement of Qian Zhuang foreign public orders amounted to over 23 million, and revenue and disbursement of foreign cash amounted to over 2.3 million. Cash receipts were 300,000, and long-term cash loans made were over 1 million. According to the latest news, the overnight interest rate in the after-market small general association has risen to three or four jiao, but no middle transactions have been made. It is said that a certain bank issued 1 million yuan in banknotes to provide relief, which shows the inside story.</p>
<h3>Small Increase in Silver Dollar and Slight Growth in Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Jiangnan small silver dollar was 835 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of one yuan from the previous day. Transactions made were 4,000 jiao in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was three jiao in the early morning, at 734 yuan and two jiao. The afternoon market rebounded by two jiao, changing to 734 yuan and four jiao. As a result, it was still one small jiao higher than the previous market. Transactions made were 160,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins still increased by 500 cash compared to the previous day, at 337,000 cash. The transaction volume was 32,354 strings of cash, equivalent to 9,600 yuan in value.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges at the local bill exchange office on the 22nd was 8,575,964 yuan, seven jiao, and one fen in silver dollars, including 3,565,264 yuan, nine jiao, and one fen in silver dollars, and 5,010,699 yuan and eight jiao in draft silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sellers Surge, Public Bonds Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, selling pressure suddenly surged, market prices weakened, and there was a great sense of imminent collapse. This was because the Yongxing Bank suddenly announced its closure due to a fourth instance of fund shortage. Shortly thereafter, the Tongtai Bank also collapsed. Rumors continued to spread widely, people's confidence was shaken, and market prices failed to rebound. The authorities' efforts to maintain financial stability still fell short. Once a crack appears, it is unknown whether it can be repaired. On the exchange, sellers poured out, and although buyers were present, they dared not cover short positions. Today is the last day for April futures, and intense competition is inevitable. The coming storm is likely just beginning. Yesterday's trading saw a continuous decline throughout the day. In the second session of the morning, the leading bonds slightly rebounded by five fen to two jiao, but the trailing bonds, such as Nos. 47 and 53, continued to decline due to selling pressure. After the afternoon opening, selling pressure was most intense for Nos. 4 and 34, continuing to fall by about one or two jiao. The market failed to stabilize at the close, and the decline persisted. The financial problems seemed quite serious and should not be underestimated. As a result, market prices declined across the board, ranging from five fen and one jiao to five or six jiao. The total transaction volume was 21.1 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Yarn Market Hit by Financial Crisis, Long Positions Suffer... Market Plunges</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering for a long time, is now suddenly weak, and the decline is intensifying. This is due to reports that the Yongxing Bank has closed down. According to market sources, other banks are also involved. As rumors spread, people became greatly alarmed. Many long position holders were forced to liquidate, and the market experienced a sharp plunge. The panic among major players was entirely due to the financial crisis. Prices for all months, including the current month, have broken through the 80 yuan mark.</p>
<p>In addition to the difficult fall of two yuan in gold</p>
<p>In the pre-market trading of standard yarn, prices for all months fell sharply. Selling pressure suddenly increased, because Shanghai's financial situation caused banks to squeeze each other at the end of April, and many rumors circulated in the market. As a result, the market deteriorated further, and prices collapsed. As a result, the near-month contracts fell by 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while the far-month contracts fell by 1.4, 6, 9 jiao to 2.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the decline in the current month was even more pronounced, and the market remained weak. It is said that inland factories and Wuxi yarn factories had significant deliveries, so many retail investors painfully liquidated their positions. At the same time, spot yarn transactions decreased significantly. As a result, the current month fell by 1.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the far months fell by 4.5 jiao. According to the report, 2,150 bales were sold by Tongji, 1,450 bales by Suilong, 550 bales by Gengfeng, 400 bales by Yichang, 1,100 bales by Run Kang, 1,350 bales by Yongda, 400 bales by Tonghe, 650 bales by Deji, 800 bales by Daji, 500 bales by Yuanyi, 450 bales by Xincheng, and 500 bales by Shengyuan. 1,300 bales were bought by Jifeng, 1,600 bales by Dafeng, 1,550 bales by Jinchang, 650 bales by Zhenda, 900 bales by Junchang, 2,050 bales by Taichang, 900 bales by Changfeng, 950 bales by Yuanda, 550 bales by Ruida, and 510 bales by Shenchang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn   Highest Price   Lowest Price   Closing Price   Increase/Decrease   Inventory</p>
<p>April     183.2      181.2      181.3      Down 2.40     3,750</p>
<p>May       180.0      178.0      178.3      Down 2.60     39,900</p>

<p>September 179.8      179.1      179.2      Down 1.90     13,500</p>
<p>Total     198,700</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Less Than 500 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of regular yarn turned clear. According to statistics, various merchant groups purchased a total of 498 bales today. The price fell by 5 jiao. The purchase amount of each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland  55   Guangdong   285  Nanjing   10</p>
<p>Fujian  5    Tianjin     20   Henan     110</p>
<p>Xiamen  8    Jiangxi     5</p>
<h3>Longs Still Struggling, Cotton Market Crack Not Yet Significant</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, and the decline is gradually increasing. However, because of the delivery issue in the current month, long position holders are still struggling. Therefore, although the yarn market has fallen sharply, the cotton market is relatively stable and has not followed the decline. However, if the yarn market does not improve, factories will naturally be unable to purchase expensive raw materials.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Universal Company Covering Shorts</p>
<p>In the pre-market trading of standard cotton, prices for all months showed signs of softening. Because cracks appeared in the yarn market, selling pressure in the cotton market was slightly stronger. However, after the second and third sessions, the Universal Company covered a large number of short positions in the current month, about 8,000 dan. Therefore, the market situation at the close was slightly firm and rebounded. As a result, the current month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day's closing price, while the far months fell by 2 to 2.5 jiao. The market sentiment was weaker in the afternoon, but the situation was stronger than the yarn market, because most spot traders did not underestimate the market. However, the general trend and prospects are not optimistic. As a result, the current month fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 fen and 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Yuda sold 7,500 dan, Mingde 1,100 dan, Suilong 1,000 dan, Gengfeng 2,400 dan, Yuanyi 1,100 dan, Yongda 1,800 dan, Huifei 1,300 dan, Yikang 4,500 dan, Ruiyuan 1,200 dan, and Xincheng 1,000 dan. Jifeng bought 6,200 dan, Dafu 3,500 dan, Dafeng 4,200 dan, Tongxing 1,100 dan, Yichang 1,200 dan, Changfeng 5,100 dan, Dachang 1,400 dan, Xinheng 1,200 dan, and Yuanda 1,200 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Increase/Decrease  Inventory</p>
<p>April    35.10      34.80      34.85      Down 0.30      54,900</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Mill Demand Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is becoming increasingly sluggish. Because yarn prices are not rising, factories find it difficult to purchase expensive raw cotton. The sources include 514 bales of Tonghua and 200 bales of Tiaohua.</p>

<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industries Are Flat and Lackluster</h3>
<p>Bombay: At the beginning of the week, the cotton market showed a reactionary trend. Afterward, the market turned firm and prices rose slightly. Export inquiries have generally declined. Japan has no intention of buying until there is definite news on British cotton. Europe is also inactive. Lancashire has some scattered transactions, selecting American cotton from Aumra, Pingguo Yu, and Benjie.</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot cotton inquiries were good last week, but transactions were mediocre. The futures market was mediocre and unremarkable due to uncertain news about American cotton. Weather reports and political news favorable to buyers, as well as rumors of cotton farmer loans, caused outside buying. However, this upward trend could not be sustained. The actual situation of Egyptian cotton is not good, and it remains lifeless before the holidays.</p>

<h3>Grain: Flour Market Stabilizes in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was uniformly sluggish. Chicago quoted foreign wheat up by 5 to 6 jiao, and Canada up by a fraction. When the market opened, prices for all months were dim. Although foreign wheat was good, the weather was enough to stir people's hearts. However, rumors have been rampant in the local financial community recently, causing panic both inside and outside the industry. Most new buyers did not enter the market, and most old transactions were closed. Therefore, prices did not rise but fell when the market opened. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly settled. Because there was no inventory of spot flour in the near term and the weather was not good in the long term, the market sentiment turned firm. As a result, the current month fell by half a fen, May fell by 1.75 fen, June fell by half a fen, July and August rose by 2.5 li, and September rose by a small fraction.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Struggle to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was initially stable after the morning opening, then fell. Chicago quoted foreign wheat up by 5 to 6 jiao, and Canada up by 2 jiao. The weather was also not good. The opening prices for all months were up by 2 to 3 fen. However, due to rumors in the financial community and the fact that the flour market did not rise but fell, people's hearts became weak. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in all months was relatively quiet, and the market sentiment remained stable. Observing this situation, it is actually financial pressure. Otherwise, there is a good outlook. As a result, the current month was down by 1 fen, July was up by 1 fen, and August and September were up by 3 fen. The spot wheat market was inactive because there was not much arrival, and factories were waiting and watching.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat  April Large Day April 20 Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>May      100.12     101.50  Up 1.375</p>
<p>July     99.375     101.875 Up 1.625</p>

<p>Spot     88.275     89.125 Up 0.70</p>
<h3>Rice Market Also Affected by Banking Industry</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of He rice in the south of Shanghai was still limited, with only about 5,000 dan arriving on the 25th and 26th (cargo). People's hearts were firm and the sales market was quite active. Gangdao, Yantai, and other merchant groups continued to purchase more than 1,000 bales. Therefore, the overall situation seemed tight, and the market was healthy. The prices of Changbang Su, Tongnan Port and other japonica, as well as Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian thin rice and other varieties, also rose by 1 to 2 jiao. Moreover, the weather was sometimes cloudy and sometimes rainy. Whether the market trend will improve in the future is still uncertain. Yin Yuan goods are scarce and the market is showing improvement. Bian Yuan is out of stock and there is no market. Few ships arrive at the river crossings in the north of Shanghai. Spot white japonica transactions continue to decline, and early thin rice sales have slightly turned around. White rice sales are still lackluster, while other goods are slightly digesting. The market price of white japonica has risen by 1 to 2 jiao, the price of thin rice has increased by 2 jiao, the price of early rice has risen by 2 to 3 jiao, and other varieties have also increased by nearly a jiao. However, the price of white rice is high and the goods are half stable, while the medium and lower grades still have a soft trend.</p>
<p>Foreign glutinous rice is selling well inland, and the market is very active. Prices could have risen by 1 to 2 jiao, and there was hope for a transaction volume of 70,000 to 80,000 bales. This was because merchant groups from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, and Ningbo were all asking about the market. However, due to the collapse of several banks yesterday and the day before, rumors were rampant in the market. Many bank drafts were suspected by people, and checks were generally rejected. Credit became tight again, and buyers could not fully enjoy the market. However, the actual strength of all parties is significant, and foreign rice still had a transaction volume of more than 48,000 bales, and glutinous rice had a transaction volume of more than 3,000 bales. No. 3 Saigon and Xiaojiao rose by 5 fen each, and other varieties rose by 2 to 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Local Refined White Sugar Rebounds by 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market remained stable. The association's trading price was 17 yuan and 4 jiao for 24-degree Dutch crude white sugar, with slight transactions, up by 5 fen. Transshipment goods were 5 yuan and 7 jiao, with transactions of about 1,200 to 1,300. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company did not intend to increase prices yesterday, but feared that tight credit would hinder sales. Therefore, Gaozhuang Cantonese crude white sugar was still 17 yuan and 3 jiao, with 780 bales sold, but not all sold. Second-grade goods were not traded at the original price. The factory's refined white sugar increased by 1 jiao due to rising raw material prices. Zhenyu No. 1 was 16 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 2 was 7 jiao, No. 3 was 5.5 jiao, and No. 4 was 4 jiao. Chaoqihao's offer remained firm and did not open, but the industry's intention to buy was not strong, so the upward trend slowed down. Yesterday, the Shan Shiba Delun ship from Holland arrived with a batch of crude white sugar of 53,585 bales and medium sugar of 1,004 bales.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Twigs and Stems Are Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Glutinous rice twigs and stems have been in short supply recently, and the stock is gradually dwindling. Moreover, the numbers in storage are low, and the number of merchants is also few. Therefore, the selling price has risen from more than 140 yuan to 150 yuan, which is very tight, and there is still a possibility of further increase.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Poor Young Silkworms Keep Silk Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The Western merchants in Shanghai took their usual Easter holiday for the previous three days, and today they resumed normal business. Recently, the overseas silk market has gradually fallen back after Japanese merchants failed to raise prices. The sales of silk in Shanghai are still quiet, and the transactions of users are also very rare. According to people in the silk industry, the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is not good because the weather has been cold and rainy this spring, and the young silkworms are developing poorly. Those who hold silk in stock believe that there are other good opportunities to sell and are unwilling to sell it easily. Therefore, the price of silk in Shanghai is not likely to fall at present.</p>
<h3>Ningzhou Black Tea Has Been Weighed</h3>
<p>The new goods of Ningzhou black tea in Ganzhou Province have been on the market in recent days. More than 20 tea factories have sent people to collect goods. According to a telegram from Xiushui, the first batch of new tea there was opened at 92 yuan yesterday, and the cost is quite large.</p>
<p>Ziyuan green tea has always been picked near the Beginning of Summer festival, resulting in most of the tea being coarse branches and large leaves, with very little precious essence. This year, the tea merchants in various villages, in view of the sluggish tea sales in recent years, are due to the old and coarse leaves that do not meet the needs of the market. They have already urged the mountain households to pick early in their spare time, in order to improve the tea.</p>
<h3>Metals: British Steel Plate is Lifeless</h3>
<p>The steel plate market has been sluggish recently, and the standard is under pressure from the unfavorable environment, gradually declining. The current price is about 7 yuan and 3 to 4 jiao per dan for 2.5 li, which is down 2 to 3 jiao from before. It is 6 yuan for 5 li, 5 yuan and 7 jiao for 7.5 li, and 5 yuan and 4 jiao for 1 point. The price of thick colored steel is 5 yuan and 3.5 jiao, which is 2 to 3 jiao less than before. However, people's hearts are very soft recently. Since yesterday, only 100 to 200 dan have been opened in the market.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Modern Masters' Speeches</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"Speech" is one of the four subjects of Confucius' school. It is listed alongside "Virtue," "Politics," and "Literature," showing that Confucius regarded "Speech" as a very important subject. In fact, during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the art of speech had already reached a very high level. As long as you have read books like "Zuo Zhuan," "Guo Yu," and "Strategies of the Warring States," you will know that in this era, not only the envoys of various countries, the so-called "officials of foreign affairs," and the persuaders, the so-called "strategists," had to pay attention to "speech," but also everyone else knew how to speak. In addition, "The Analects of Confucius," which records the words and deeds of Confucius and Mencius, "Mozi," which records the words and deeds of Mo Di, and the later "Book of Rites: Tan Gong," which record many dialogues, debates, and talks, although they are like recorded sayings for preaching and teaching, are very elegant and are no less than excellent ancient literature. Of course, we also know that the ancients believed that "words that are not refined will not travel far." Even though the records of "speech" at that time were inevitably embellished, we cannot deny that Confucius' school separated "speech" and "literature," and that "speech" was a kind of learning in itself at that time.</p>
<p>The recorded sayings of eminent monks and great Confucian scholars since the Tang and Song dynasties are all words for preaching and teaching, focusing not on "speech" or "literature." However, they seemed to have already realized that "literature to clarify the Dao" could not clarify it, and "literature to carry the Dao" could not carry it, so they had to switch to spoken language. They recorded their lectures, their dialogues and debates with teachers and friends, all in spoken language, which was naturally more authentic than using ancient prose. But in terms of literary value, apart from being an attempt at spoken language writing, it really has little literary flavor in itself. Therefore, catalogue scholars have always listed recorded sayings in the "philosophy" category, as philosophical books, and would not put them in the "collected works" category, as literary books. We know that in ancient Greece and Rome, speeches such as those of Demosthenes and Cicero had long become a category of literature. However, in China, it must be said that it is only recently that there has been a category of speeches in the department of literature in library catalogs.</p>
<p>Now, as I compile this selection of famous speeches, except for Mr. Liang Rengong, who has passed away, the rest are all alive and well. There are twelve recorded speeches in total, by eleven authors from Zhang Taiyan and Liang Rengong to John Dewey. Only Mr. Dewey is a foreigner, with two speeches recorded. The earliest speech is that of Mr. Zhang Taiyan, recorded exactly thirty years ago. Mr. Zhang was imprisoned in 1903 (the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty) for advocating "anti-Manchu" and "revolution" in the Shanghai Subao case. After three years in prison, he went to Japan on June 29, 1905, immediately after his release from prison. This is his speech at the welcome meeting for comrades in Japan, published in the sixth issue of the Minbao, the organ magazine of the Min Party at that time. Mr. Zhang's autobiography of his life is an extremely valuable material. The most recent speech is Mr. Jiang Menglin's "How Should We Study?" This is Mr. Jiang's speech on the Tianjin Youth Association Broadcasting Station, published in the Tianjin Dagongbao in February of this year, and has not yet been compiled by other books. Among these eleven figures, some are scholars of Sinology or writers, some are philosophers or educators, some are revolutionaries, and some are scientists. Their speeches talk about how to be a person, how to be a revolutionary, how to be a writer, and how to be a scientist. Some talk about how to study hard and how to cultivate oneself academically; some talk about how to hone one's morality and how to cultivate oneself personally. Their expertise may be specialized, and their thoughts and opinions may not be consistent, but they are united in their positive spirit and their efforts to progress. I have compiled their speeches together as a kind of reading material for young friends, which may be of some help in their cultivation of learning and conduct.</p>
<p>Of course, in such a small book, it is impossible to collect all the speeches of famous people in the country, and besides, some who are called famous people may not have any wonderful speeches to record. As for foreign famous scholars who have come to China to lecture, there are also Russell and Driesch, but here I have only selected Dewey's speeches, because his thoughts and theories are not as difficult to understand as Russell's mathematical logic or Driesch's organic philosophy. But I have to state that in the past ten years, due to the progress of the Chinese intellectual world, Dewey's pragmatism has gradually lost its authority in China during the "May Fourth" era.</p>
<p>Here, two lectures by Dewey are selected, one titled "Morality and Human Nature" and the other titled "The Place of Emotions in Morality." He advocates a positive and progressive morality, opposes the passive restraint of instincts, and advocates cultivating correct ideas and arousing and promoting vigorous emotions. Currently in China, most of our young people are either obsequiously flattering the world or are dispirited and muddleheaded. Mr. Dewey's principles of how to be a person are still worthy of our consideration. For example, he said:</p>
<p>What is the most hateful thing in the world now? It is this non-active but passive morality. Therefore, today's so-called good citizens are those sycophants who speak and act mediocrely, not those who have creative ability, a positive spirit, and a vigorous spirit to transform the world. Is this not a very hateful thing?</p>
<p>After reading this passage, I could not help but feel ashamed and deeply hate myself. As he also said:</p>
<p>Emotions can excite us, inspire us, and impel us. We cannot but follow them. Emotions such as hope, anger, joy, rage, love, and desire add so much color to life, so much fun and energy. Without them, how lifeless it would be! Even if there is reason, the ability to know and act, it is like a mechanical creation, a calculating machine, without joy in success or sorrow in failure, utterly boring. Therefore, life has interest and value because there are emotions. Otherwise, living is like being dead.</p>
<p>Currently, among our young people, there are many sycophants who are merely flattering the world and lack vitality. But we cannot help but hope that young friends will all be willing to "be those who have creative ability, a positive spirit, and a vigorous spirit to transform the world." Is Mr. Dewey's new moral doctrine not enough to be a kind of medicine for our youth? This is one of the reasons why I compiled this selection of speeches and put Mr. Dewey's two speeches at the end.</p>
<h3>Dance Marathon (2)</h3>
<p>— (Made by American L.I. Farael) Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>He also learned one thing, which was how to dance like an American. He had a friend who was a mixed Greek and American. This friend took him to a dance school called "Taxcance" on West Madison Street. He paid a dollar and got ten tickets, each ticket good for one to one and a half minutes of dancing. Every girl there was willing to dance with him, because she earned five cents for every minute. His tickets were used up quickly, and he bought some more. It didn't matter whether he could dance or not, the girls liked teaching him. He often went to dance halls, spending three, four, or five dollars each time. Occasionally, girls asked him if he would take her home, spending a few more dollars, and he could get some other benefits. Since he regularly went to dance halls, he was even less able to save money.</p>
<p>Once, Tax used his savings to buy a suit, with trousers that had wide legs. He kept his hair short, and put pomade on it, parting it in the middle. Only then did he look like a wealthy young man. He paid attention to all the words that American wealthy young men spoke. So he went to public dance halls, which only charged an entrance fee and allowed you to dance for a long time. There were often large groups of girls there, beautiful American girls, some with long, beautiful, milky skin and cherry-like red lips. He asked them to dance. They often danced with him once. But when he started to chat, they paid attention to his tone. If he asked them to dance again, they apologized and said that they had a date for the next dance. Therefore, when he danced there, he often had to dance with those showy, ugly girls who were called "wallflowers." So he went back to the dance halls, where it cost a dime to dance once, and all the girls were willing to dance with him.</p>
<p>One day, Tax turned twenty-five. His Greek mountain home was only a vague shadow in his memory. He had lived in America for twelve years. He worked ten hours a day in a bar, earning ten dollars a week, and secretly had three to five dollars of extra income each week. He wanted to get rich. He wanted to wait until he opened his own bar or restaurant, became rich, and took an American wife back to Greece to show off like a big boss. He had thirty-five dollars in the bank, which could be used as the foundation for making such a great fortune.</p>
<h3>Loan</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>On the day the "Cotton Loan" certificates were issued, people were so busy from dawn to dusk that they didn't even have time to drink a cup of tea. Farmers from all directions were packed tightly around the primary school. It was bustling like a gathering.</p>
<p>I was surrounded by our own people, who exchanged the permits they had received for loan certificates under my hand. Farmers came in batches and went out in batches. They surrounded us, with a circle of temporary counters made of students' desks and chairs separating us.</p>
<p>Ever since I brushed my teeth outside the door, when the sky was slightly bright, the new moon hung in the sky, and there were still shadows on the ground, there were already farmers who had come early waiting quietly. After that, with the crowing of the rooster, people came like a tide. In addition to the three classrooms that had been converted into reception rooms, which were full, the small playground also seemed like a temple fair, with people squeezing against each other, craning their necks towards the certificate exchange point, and chattering noisily.</p>
<p>Both the "entrance" and the "exit" were full of people, making it difficult to get in and out. Although the self-defense corps members were clearing the way with sticks, it was still ineffective. Seeing that the order was about to become unmanageable, I asked someone with a loud voice to shout:</p>
<p>"Everyone, stop crowding. If you crowd again, we won't issue money slips today."</p>
<p>These words were powerful. No one had rushed here before dawn without the two-yuan-per-mu loan. For the sake of the money, their tense situation eased, and we opened up the entrance and exit, allowing people to come in one by one and go out one by one.</p>
<p>At the beginning of sunrise, my pen began to move non-stop, and I couldn't stop even when the clock struck twelve. For the sake of the dark crowd waiting quietly outside the window, my conscience did not allow me to rest. I could not make the members wait from morning until dark.</p>
<p>"..." The members quietly exchanged their certificates and went out.</p>
<p>My head was dizzier than being exposed to the scorching sun, my eyes were going black, and the words I wrote seemed to have legs. At the same time, my wrist was also a little sore. Among our group of responsible people, no one had yet expressed fatigue, and I didn't have the courage to suggest a rest.</p>
<p>The work continued for another hour. The staff alternated, but I was still writing.</p>
<p>"Jiaocun Sun Dade... two and a half mu of land,... only one and a half mu of cotton..."</p>
<p>Hearing the validator shout this, I suddenly felt a slight prick. I remembered three days ago, when a middle-aged woman came to my house and sent a gift, saying that she was asking me to give Sun Dade a helping hand on his behalf. After she finished speaking, she left the gift and left.</p>
<p>My spirits were restored. I stared at the thin, small man with a few withered, yellow rat whiskers outside the counter. The man's head was bowed.</p>
<p>"Are you Sun Dade?..."</p>
<p>"Uh...uh..." He seemed to know why I was paying special attention to him, but he also seemed a little embarrassed and couldn't speak.</p>
<p>"You can only get three yuan. Take your twenty eggs back and have your woman take them back - it's official business..." I said.</p>
<p>"Uh! Uh!"</p>
<p>I wrote the number "three" on a pre-printed voucher. This thin, honest man received the voucher and carefully put it in his arms and walked out, glancing back at me a little fearfully.</p>
<p>Bribery is just as common in the countryside...</p>
<p>This continued until dusk, and there were fewer and fewer people. I took the opportunity to go outside the door to order a meal. The teahouse on this small stall was full of people. Today was a very profitable day. The waiter said to me:</p>
<p>"Will you still be giving out loans tomorrow, sir!"</p>
<h3>Morning Climb of Guānxiàng Mountain</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>—One of the Impressions of Qingdao—</p>
<p>Guānxiàng Mountain, with the observatory and some small pine trees, stands in the center of the city.</p>
<p>Once you climb up, countless red rooftops and Qingdao, surrounded by blue bays on three sides, are clearly revealed in the fresh morning sunlight, immediately giving one a completely European flavor.</p>
<p>The sea surface to the west, perhaps affected by the wind or due to the morning climate, showed two different colors: gray-blue and gray-white. The gray-white area blended with the horizon, merging into one. The brown sailboats sailing on it were simply like hanging in the air, evoking the fantasy of a mirage.</p>
<p>In the bay to the south, near the naval dock, a gray foreign warship appeared, like a tiger or wolf lying there, waiting to devour people.</p>
<p>The Westernized city, quietly lying at the foot of the mountain, was like a blessed Western young master, quietly enjoying the rest of the night's sleep.</p>
<p>The Jiaoji train, which had worked hard all night in the Shandong wilderness, was probably feeling dissatisfied with this, as it was still roaring and roaring along the seaside at the foot of the mountain to the north.</p>
<p>Next to the railway, the ships at the big and small ports, perhaps expressing sympathy, were also helping to cheer by shouting once or twice.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church, using the majestic posture of its twin towers, stood in the air as if to overwhelm all the buildings beneath its feet, as if trying to show its dignity and not be disturbed by anything.</p>
<p>However, the two tall chimneys standing far away next to the National Bridge, like hooligans outside a church door, opened their mouths with an air of contempt for everything and spewed mocking black smoke into the sky?</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, the city sounds gradually became louder, and I slowly walked down the mountain.</p>
<h3>Scenery</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The internal scenery that cannot be hidden,</p>
<p>Fell from the solar system onto people's heads.</p>
<p>Withered, that trivial flower.</p>
<p>The soul expresses satisfaction.</p>
<p>There is a boat swaying on the coast that is difficult to dissolve.</p>
<p>There is gentle beauty underneath the secret,</p>
<p>If I could put on a golden dress,</p>
<p>Without time,</p>
<p>I will stand on her vermilion face.</p>
<p>Holding her in my arms and running hard,</p>
<p>Without time, without light.</p>
<p>She struggles desperately, I run desperately.</p>
<p>Not far from the prominent coastline,</p>
<p>She is sleeping delicately, and I have stopped.</p>
<h3>Mountain Pastoral (2)</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>"Complaining, it doesn't matter, it doesn't cost anything!... It's always better for travelers to be amiable."</p>
<p>"Sitting in the shop doesn't count, acting big here, scaring crows? I just don't like complaining. People like that want to take up eight seats for eating and occupy the best beds at the inn. It's just a bit a bit..."</p>
<p>Old Chen hadn't found the right words when he heard Boss Qin sighing behind him, so he didn't say it.</p>
<p>"What kind of straw sandals are these? They're like they've grown mouths! Ugh, they're practically biting people..."</p>
<p>Old Xu heard Boss Qin's complaints and said to Old Chen:</p>
<p>"Forget it, listen, his feet must be blistered... If we don't let him rest, he'll realize it. We're all travelers, so it's better to be a little considerate. It's not worth offending people!"</p>
<p>"What? Can't you carry it anymore?" Old Chen turned around and asked coldly. "If you can't walk, then rest!"</p>
<p>"Where is it? What does this count for? I'm saying we should wait for him to get better. It's not worth..."</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of offending him? Just follow me, and I'll deal with him." Then Old Chen shouted loudly to Boss Qin: "Hey, Boss Qin, are your feet hurting? We can't rest on this section of mountain road, you know? Alas, it depends on everyone's luck today..."</p>
<p>Walking in the mountains where it is not easy to see people is difficult to do. Even if one knows that there is no danger, if someone suddenly mentions that one should be careful, then one cannot help but become timid. Because the mountain roads in the border areas of China are always unpredictable. Therefore, although Boss Qin replied with a suspicious tone, "I don't think so!", he unconsciously quickened his pace and no longer tried to come up with various ways to get everyone to rest.</p>
<p>Old Chen turned around and saw this short man limping along, and he continued walking while laughing happily to himself.</p>
<p>These three people had accidentally met on the road. Because of the loneliness and the habit of travelers chatting casually with strangers, they started by borrowing fire for their dry tobacco, one asking "May I ask your name?" and the other replying "I dare not, my surname is Chen." Then they began to talk about the weather, business, and the splendor of that hotel on a certain street. Thus, from the perspective of others, they seemed to be partners who had agreed to travel together. However, this requires that they are dressed similarly, and that the weight and value of each other's baggage are not too different; otherwise, they still cannot get along. The reason why Boss Qin and Old Chen were at odds was precisely because, comparatively, Boss Qin's clothes were too proper. Furthermore, after scrutinizing Old Chen and Old Xu deeply from head to toe with sharp eyes, he coldly replied to their greetings, and when Old Chen, with a cigarette holder in his mouth, asked him for fire, he only grunted from his nostrils and raised his dry tobacco pipe, as if he was extremely impatient.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Right to One's Name</h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>It is reported that lawyer Lai Yunhui, representing Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, issued a statement regarding the right to one's name, saying that it is proper for young people to study physical education and practice swimming, but it is inappropriate for someone to compile and print books using her name as a selling point, which violates Article 19 of the Civil Code regarding the right to one's name, and so on.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong became famous for participating in the Far Eastern Games and was called the Mermaid. She was hired at a high price to perform in Nanchang. When she came to Shanghai, there were even incidents where she could not go into the water due to the crowd. She is a rare swimming talent in Chinese sports history.</p>
<p>However, after making one speech, she quietly returned to Guangzhou. At that time, some people said that being called "Mermaid" was an insult to women, and that these three words might ruin her future. In fact, the origin of "Mermaid" may not have been intentionally frivolous. However, Yang Xiuqiong is a "lady," so unfounded slanders arose when discussing her marriage.</p>
<p>Now, the statement in the newspaper says that the publisher is using her name as a selling point for compiling and printing books. Presumably, it is some kind of sports book, but the author has not seen it and does not know whether it is malicious or well-intentioned. Judging from the matter itself, the bookseller is using Yang Xiuqiong's name for business purposes. Moreover, I have not reviewed Article 19 of the Civil Code to see what the regulations on the right to one's name are. To what extent must the infringement reach before one can request the court to remove the infringement and obtain damages? I remember that a certain weaving factory used Ms. Yang's beautiful photo while swimming in an advertisement, boasting about how their swimwear was different from the crowd, as if Ms. Yang had even personally written the inscription: Although there is a difference between "agreeing" and "disagreeing," it is similar to "infringement," with little difference.</p>
<p>These are just random thoughts, and I am not blaming Ms. Yang for favoring one over the other, or perhaps the book that is now being used as a selling point is indeed something that makes people unable to restrain themselves from speaking out. However, going one step further, people in society today cannot "become famous." Slightly outstanding figures are soon seen as tools to be exploited. The advertisements of venereal disease doctors and wild chicken schools all drag in a large number of well-known figures. In the meantime, sending a mimeographed letter to seek consent is one in a hundred. (Whether they agree or not is naturally still a question.) When Ms. Yang returned to Guangdong, she said that she was "seeking further education." Even if people use this to promote themselves, as long as they do not intentionally "infringe," what does it matter? Publishing the advertisement might revive old cases and serve as conversation material for many people. Thinking of the dead who wrote "Human Words Are Terrifying" in a bloody suicide note, how their names were being "infringed" upon! Alas!</p>
<h3>When Living in Indifference</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>I will never forget it: when there was a time when the uncontrollable express train of life, due to a moment of carelessness amongst a thousand cautions, rushed into the deserted wilderness, into the cold and endlessly long underground tunnel, then, from the past painful experiences, I knew: there would surely be a long, endless night without stars or moonlight waiting for me, and the weather ahead would be as cold as the severe ice of the North.</p>
<p>When the heavy night falls, I will not be able to see people, nor myself; a kind of terror and suspicion will never be forgotten, as familiar as returning to my old home, and without hesitation, will come to visit the tired heart that I have secretly hidden; and then, without any consideration, will continuously knock on it with cold sounds, like a snake, like lightning.</p>
<p>The result is: this unpleasant, shudder-inducing guest of thought, rudely snatches away one's heart. A kind of cold air passes through the whole body, reminding me of the great white bear galloping in the snowy lands of North America, rude and proud—yes, when life is not very easy, and this not very easy life falls into the terrible indifference of the human world, I feel that the world has abandoned me; and I, in the flames of anger, may think that I no longer need this world, and the indifference hidden within it.</p>
<p>Can it be said that the instinct for survival of living beings is itself a sin? Who can believe it? But the phenomenon of life vaguely reveals to us in the distance: "Strive to walk on the road to survival: the instinct for survival, even if it is not a sin, but every living thing endowed with the instinct for survival, must suffer the innocent punishment of the human world!"</p>
<p>It's all hard to bear! But everyone feels that the area traversed by life's express train has no beautiful scenery; on the contrary, the train is always stumbling and tumbling in windy and rainy weather. And the countless souls dwelling inside are just like prisoners exiled to a desolate area, undoubtedly forever whipped and punished by the whips of human indifference and treacherousness—only able to throw the good-hearted enthusiasm of the human world into the wind and rain outside without any consideration.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone in the cage might boldly stick their head out to take a look? But the scene is worrying: lying ahead is a winding, impossibly long, narrow road, and the fog is constantly thickening in the endless wind and rain; thus, people are filled with suspicion: "In the indifference of the outside world, perhaps ahead is the unknowable end of the world, the final reckoning of destruction?"</p>
<p>However, this is ultimately a mystery—a fog-like mystery!</p>
<p>(Who has ever thought of cursing the treacherousness of the human world? In a long string of difficult days, it is common to live a terrible and careless life: thus, along with the frightening waves of life, some rotten, abandoned waste and dregs flow along: human indifference, human treacherousness, human mutual framing and deception, human brown cunning!)</p>
<p>As if just waking up from a vague nightmare, past suffering has finally revealed to me something elusive: the indifference of the human world always stands like a stubborn iceberg in front of me, and it is not easy for people whose hands and feet are bound by life to climb over that thousand-foot cold cliff, because survival itself, it is said, is an unforgivable sin; and people must use the indifference they spit out to harm themselves.</p>
<p>Let's also praise this as the glory of mankind (if you don't want to say "shameful words"), when life falls into indifference!</p>
<h3>Trip to Haiyan</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Luxuriant reeds grow on top of the loose yellow clay soil, and the azure sky reflects the lightness and calmness of the coast. The sound of the surging sea is always the same unchanging tune, shasha, bobo, giving people the feeling that this calm coast is somewhat empty and sad. Looking from the fiery wheel tossing on the sea surface, you can clearly see the winding coastline unfolding far away. The sound of the rocks on the shore being struck by the waves and echoing, and the silvery white spray, are the same from afar, a kind of faint sorrow.</p>
<p>With the wandering melancholic steps of a vagabond, I jumped out of the city and quietly drifted to the coastal village following the tide of the surging sea. — It seems that my fate is carved as a wandering, suffering person. From childhood to youth, I have lived an unstable life without rest. However, anyway, I hope to find the miracle I yearn for on that dark journey. Yes! In that unhypocritical city, with the same terrible, ferocious faces and the cruel, plundering whips in the countryside, especially on the coast still carrying the breath of the primitive—I am so eager to find the happiness of the human world that I think of in such a place. But is this a dream? When things give me a more realistic and clear understanding, I feel that not only the quiet countryside has been ravaged as coldly and sadly by the same evildoers as the modern city, but also the remote, tranquil coast, still carrying the breath of the primitive, has clearly revealed that the storm of the times has swept everywhere—Oh, am I fantasizing? — Young people without much experience are always enthusiastic and yearning. However, when a disappointment and a cold draft are given in reality, they will always think that the whips of the evil of the times possess everything in this society.</p>
<p>Leaving the sea-going life, my two legs straddled Haiyan Street, a small town of the eighteenth century and also a vast village. From the small boats floating in the creek surrounding the reeds, you can see that it stands like a Hong Kong-style island, with high peaks with buildings that are neither new nor old, and tower-like碉樓(diaolou, watchtowers), and a simple shadow penetrates the traveler's heart. I pray to get my experience in such a coastal town, and get the original form of everything in human question.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>At first, I wandered with my friends among all the unique scenery. I did not forget that the part I needed was a quiet and beautiful landscape. It was early spring at that time, and the gentle wind drifting from the distant Indian Ocean to the South China Sea was rippling like bewitching the hearts of travelers. The sea breeze seems to have no peculiar atmosphere at all, only feeling the beauty and horror of spring. However, I stepped over the green mountains and swayed through the green sea, but still could not find what I longed to desire. Only what I saw was the traces of the war hidden many years ago—like sad arrows, passing over my heart, so faint and desolate.</p>
<p>Before long, when I felt that Haiyan was so boring and had stepped into the circle of the sorrow of the times, I began to drift to other places on the sea again, still so quietly!</p>
<h3>Celebrated Person in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>"Are you talking about Xihe Xian? I know him, I know him, we're acquainted."</p>
<p>The visitor shouted loudly, and then recounted Xihe Xian's recent situation as if telling a story.</p>
<p>"In our town, Xihe Xian is the most humorous and a learned man. Although he is a doctor, he is a 'halfway monk' Confucian doctor. In the past, I heard that he was also a Xiucai [successful candidate in the imperial examinations]. A Xiucai is already enough to be respected in our town, let alone this Xiucai is also learned? The doctor is learned and also a Xiucai, so Xihe Xian is regarded as a sage by the people of the town. When he goes out to make house calls, people greet him on the road. Some call out, 'Where are you going, Xiucai?' Some call out, 'Are you going to see a patient, doctor?' They are all expressing their respect for him. He is also very amiable. To those who greet him, whether they are old people or women, he always answers with a smile, 'Going to see a patient.' or 'Yes, going to see a patient.' However, when he passes by the tavern, the old tavern owner always winks at him and secretly asks him with gestures: 'Have a drink?' Then he opens his mouth and says, 'Have a drink and then go, it doesn't matter, the money will be recorded on the signboard.' Because Xihe Xian always says, 'I didn't bring any money' when he encounters the tavern owner's greeting.</p>
<p>"Xihe Xian! That's what we young people call him! Since he likes to have a drink or two, it's no wonder the tavern owner wants to solicit his business, but Xihe Xian is not a person who can drink, only drinks a cup or two, and the face with a large head and a sharp chin, like a gourd, turns red, wipes his mouth with his sleeve, and says, 'I'm drunk, I'm drunk'! Sometimes he just leaves like that. Sometimes he doesn't want to leave, but starts chatting in the tavern. He is a learned man, and apart from the tavern owner, no one is qualified to talk to him. He is also a learned man. I heard that he can recite the entire 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' from beginning to end, it's really amazing. When two learned men meet, they inevitably argue. Once, they even fell out over the question of whether Cao Cao in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms was a bad guy; Xihe Xian didn't go to the tavern to drink for several days, and the tavern owner didn't greet him to have a drink either. At that time, Xihe Xian was arguing that Cao Cao was an amazing figure, while the tavern owner was arguing that Cao Cao was a big villain. At first, they argued according to reason, but later, Xihe Xian opened his eyes and stretched his finger fiercely to the tavern owner's nose and shouted, 'You know shit, Cao Cao can write poetry, can Liu Bei write poetry?' The tavern owner also didn't show weakness and slapped the table and said, 'Cao Cao is a treacherous hero, Liu Bei is a benevolent lord, what's the use of being able to write poetry, why didn't Kongming join Cao Cao but joined Liu Bei? Xihe Xian thought for a while, he couldn't win the argument with reason, he was ashamed into anger, and shouted angrily, 'You know shit, you know shit'! The tavern owner was also angered by being scolded, and said, 'You only know shit, you only know shit'! The two fell out like that. Xihe Xian seemed to have broken off relations with the tavern owner for several days.</p>
<p>"Now his beard is white, and the tavern owner has already died. Although he still goes to the tavern to drink as usual, no one argues with him anymore."</p>
<h3>Alley</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>From dawn, this alley is filled with noisy sounds. The shouting of vegetable sellers, the playing of children, the senseless quarrels of neighbors, the bicycle bell of the newspaper delivery man, all mixed together to form a hubbub in the air. If it is at lunchtime, all sounds become even more noisy. Even in the dead of night, you can often hear the footsteps of night travelers, the sound of knocking on doors. This alley plays that annoying and vulgar music all day and all night. And I am deeply annoyed by this music.</p>
<p>In my annoyance, the impressions of two alleys came into my consciousness.</p>
<p>The first alley was in Beiping, a nostalgic place where I lived for several years. The alley I lived in was a long one. The vermilion gates of each house and the verdant trees at the entrance formed an extremely beautiful contrast. In spring, the alley was full of falling locust flowers. Some blackbirds came to peck at the leaves on the treetops. Everything was filled with such a medieval air of tranquility. It's not that there were no peddlers, but their cries were like a piece of court music. Early morning almond tea, late-night hard noodles, iced drinks in summer, sweet grapes and dates in early autumn, even a barber's burden, a junk collector, their voices were gentle and full of poetry. Early in the morning, a snail-like water cart passed through the alley, leaving people with the water they needed. Sometimes some carriages and horses passed by, but by dusk it was completely quiet. Then we could linger in the courtyard, enjoying those priceless moments of happiness, watching the horns slowly fall, watching the black crows returning to their nests flying all over the sky, watching the bats, and night came unnoticed. Passing the day like this, even sleeping at night was comfortable, and dreams were light.</p>
<p>I can't forget that alley, I can't forget that alley!</p>
<p>Another alley. In Suzhou, a city overflowing with poetry, embracing the name of paradise, there was an alley where I once lived. Although it didn't have much of the flavor of a waterside town, its tranquility still attracts my dreams to this day. Planted with trees, the alley was full of green shade. Half of the stone slabs underfoot were moist. Shut inside the door, you never heard a bit of noise, except for the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves whispering, and the sound of people coming from the opposite courtyard. Peaches, pomegranates, and balsam were planted in the courtyard. Everything was like the "daytime scene" chanted in ancient poetry. During the day, you could hear rickshaws dragging past outside the door, and low calls of peddlers. By dusk, everything was as if bewitched and became quiet. Then we could hear the neighbors putting up the door panels and window panels, hear the sound of a fortune teller walking in the dark alley knocking on a small copper gong, and hear the sound of an old lay Buddhist in the house behind chanting scriptures while striking a clear chime and wooden fish. Slowly all these disappeared, and what was placed in front of us was a long, gentle, and lovely black robe. And we also sank into sleep.</p>
<p>Then, on the second day, it would come again like this, familiar, but not monotonous. I love that alley, and I love the people in that alley and their lives even more!</p>
<p>These two poetic alleys that were related to my life often visit my imagination when I am upset. I can't live through these noisy days. In the city, I once visited all sides to find similar alleys, but all I got was disappointment. Near Jing'an Temple Road, there is one called Lovw Lane. The name is very charming, quiet, with window screens that let through the light, and the sound of piano flowing from the other side. The shadows of the trees swayed slowly under the streetlights, but that was always too "metropolitan" and too "modern". So I didn't make a second visit to that place.</p>
<p>I just miss those two alleys, and it's a kind of half-melancholy and half-sweet nostalgia!</p>

<h3>Excerpt from "Leimen Noveluo Leaves MGM"</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Of the many male stars in Hollywood that we enjoy watching, even if Leimen Noveluo cannot be considered the absolute top, he can certainly be ranked among the best. Therefore, any news concerning him, especially rumors that he is leaving the silver screen, is something that everyone is eager to know about.</p>
<p>Is Leimen Noveluo really not making any more films? Have his fame and his struggle for fame shattered his silver dreams? What are his future plans? How is he living now? These are all questions we want answered.</p>
<p>He has been a star in Hollywood for thirteen consecutive years. He is a handsome young man, a silver screen idol worshipped by millions. Idealists around the world regard him as the epitome of male perfection. But recently, something seems to have gone wrong. His box office earnings have gradually declined, and his films have lacked the captivating magic. Most recently, at the beginning of this year, he suddenly announced his departure from MGM, his long-time employer of over a decade. At the time, after filming "The Night Is Young," MGM was planning to shoot another grand musical film. However, Leimen requested that the company release him from his duties. The company, seeing his sincere plea, had no choice but to agree. Thus, he left the silver film circle. But as a result, rumors have flourished.</p>
<p>Recently, a journalist, being an old friend of Leimen, made a special trip to his house to interview him and ask him what was really going on. But Leimen Noveluo replied without hesitation, "What? Leave the movies? Of course not. If I have any sense, I certainly wouldn't. I wouldn't stop working either. Lost my ambition? A person who loses their ambition is half-dead. But... in the immediate future, I don't want to make any more films, because the stories in the films I've been making lately really bore me. I feel like my film career has a major problem. Do you know what it is? It's a lack of progress. For years, I haven't made any progress. In the last five years, I haven't done anything I should have done."</p>
<p>Indeed, Leimen Noveluo's words are both honest and insightful. He is not one to deceive himself. He continued, "A person's art should also improve with age. I am an adult now. I don't want to live in the past forever. I don't want to keep playing the same stories over and over again. Viennese romances, football stories... My departure from MGM was amicable, but that's the reason. What's the point of repeating the same themes over and over?"</p>
<p>Under the constraints of his contract, Leimen Noveluo did not have the freedom to choose his own stories, so he had to temporarily announce his departure. He said, "I no longer feel any interest in the issues of ten years ago. Although with my looks, I can still play characters younger than my actual age, my state of mind is no longer that of ten years ago. In 'The Night Is Young,' I played a 25-year-old young man, but in my best efforts, all I could do was imitate my past performances. Therefore, I asked myself: 'Is this sustainable?'"</p>
<p>"Even doing that is not an easy task. Constantly playing the role of a romantic lead, always trying to give people something different to see, is extremely difficult. It would be different if I were a woman, because, you know, actresses can constantly change their outfits, hairstyles, and makeup. But a man..." As he said this, he smiled mischievously and winked.</p>
<p>Leimen is now writing a play called "Another Story." It tells the story of a movie star who, after being a star for over ten years, becomes tired of it and is willing to sacrifice his star status and income to go on stage. This is likely Leimen Noveluo's own "confession," as he is seriously considering going to London to perform on stage and temporarily change his surroundings.</p>

<h3>Review of "Sweet Adeline"</h3>
<p>— Chan Fei</p>
<p>Sweet Adeline – Cathay Film</p>
<p>If one were to argue that musical films do not require substantial content and only need to be visually stunning, then "Sweet Adeline" would be praised. This is Warner Bros.'s big musical film following "42nd Street," "Footlight Parade," "Gold Diggers of 1933," and "Dames." However, judging solely on form while disregarding content is not a reasonable argument. No matter how brilliantly the form expresses its golden and dazzling aspects, the impact it has on the audience will ultimately be infinitely empty.</p>
<p>"Sweet Adeline" also fails to escape the old cliché of unprincipled romantic love, a cliché that has already made people feel bored and weary. What is never lacking here is intoxicating jazz music, extravagant and decadent dances, the gimmicks of comical characters, and passionate embraces and kisses. All these things, considered essential for old-fashioned musical films, are all present in "Sweet Adeline." However, due to the shallowness and vulgarity of the content, all this extravagance and decadence is nothing more than a technically proficient accumulation of artists trying to mask emptiness. Who can discern any meaning of life or reflection of the times in this? It is proving to be quite difficult for new types of musical films to emerge in America.</p>
<p>Yes, this film naturally cannot satisfy those who seek realistic portrayals, but for soft gentlemen who crave wild enjoyment, it is intoxicating liquor. For example, the wildly joyous chorus in the hotel, the dances reflected in the mirror, and the love songs on the swing frame under the brilliant starlight and flowing water of the lawn… all cater lavishly to the tastes of gentlemen and ladies. Who can deny that these are not the peak expressions of American musical films? It is truly an intoxicating film, but also an empty film that obscures the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>That's all I want to say about the film itself. Because this film is Mervyn Leroy's, the director of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," work following "Footlight Parade," I want to say something about him. Chinese audiences, at the same time, had high expectations for him after "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" left a deep impression.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, film directors, like artists in other fields, have their own worldviews and distinct styles. In America, we can name at least a few, such as Frank Borzage's sentimentalism, which is consistently expressed from "Seventh Heaven" to "Man's Castle." King Vidor expresses a consistent humanism and reformism in works such as "The Crowd" and "Our Daily Bread." Cecil B. DeMille appears as a religious author with a penchant for historical dramas. Ernst Lubitsch maintains a consistent fantasy and lightness in "The Love Parade" or "The Merry Widow." All of them consistently maintain their inherent styles. But Mervyn Leroy is similar to Rouben Mamoulian. Mamoulian produced the legendary "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and the love-supremacy "Song of Songs" or "Queen Christina." Mervyn Leroy produced the cutting-edge, reality-exposing "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" and the content-lacking musical "Footlight Parade" or "Sweet Adeline," and even vulgar works like "The World Changes." Taking "Footlight Parade" as an example, it at least included a scene of unemployed veterans seeking relief, touching on reality to some extent. "Sweet Adeline" does not even achieve this much. Of course, this is limited by the script, but the fact that he does not have a fixed style and that his works do not express his own worldview is very obvious.</p>
<p>With this in mind, people do not need to have overly high expectations for him. Moreover, considering that he was able to become the son-in-law of Warner Bros. boss Jack Warner, perhaps he is just a commercial writer who prioritizes business above all else.</p>

<h3>Clouds, Sky, and Hate (Living on Velvet) (3)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Tuoguan raised his head, looked up at the sky, and said thoughtfully, "I don't know myself either. There might be something in there... that wanted my life but didn't succeed. I just want to give it another chance." Soon, they arrived at Huade's house. Tuolei was shaving, and Huade was standing beside him talking to him. Tuolei suddenly stopped, raised his razor, and asked Huade, "Why are you telling me to shave?" Huade said, "We're going to a party."</p>
<p>Tuolei said, "Whose party?" Huade said, "Aimei Boluntisi's party. She lives with her aunt, Masha Boluntisi. Her aunt might not approve of your behavior." Tuolei asked again, "Who is Aimei Boluntisi?" Huade hesitated for a moment, then said, "She might marry me. I love her deeply, but she... doesn't love me quite as much." Tuolei, while lathering, continued to ask, "What kind of person is she?" Huade said seriously, "About forty-five years old... weighs a little over two hundred pounds... her eyes are blue... I mean one of them... her skin is speckled." Tuolei interjected, "In short, the best there is." Huade said, "That's right. She is beautiful, lovely, polite, and very intelligent..." They finished speaking and laughed at each other.</p>
<p>In the evening, Huade took Tuolei to Aimei Boluntisi's house. Tuolei felt that everyone was staring at him because everyone had read the evening newspaper, and most of the newspaper's account of the air force exercise described this arrogant, uninvited guest. But Tuolei didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Later, he met a girl with dark hair and fair skin, and he cared even less about people's attention.</p>
<p>Tuolei didn't know who the girl was. The two of them seemed to have met by chance and began dancing unconsciously. He found her perfume lovely, as well as her pout and her throaty voice with its slight awkwardness. He didn't even think that this girl might be Aimei. He completely forgot what Huade had told him that afternoon. All he knew was that the woman he was holding in his arms now was the most perfect woman he had ever seen in his life. He didn't care who she was. He didn't have time to ask her.</p>
<p>As for Aimei—because it was indeed Aimei—she was temporarily seduced by his rough and aloof attitude. When the music stopped, the two of them were at the entrance to the lawn. Unconsciously, Tuolei led her out. Strangely, they seemed like old friends, not needing to ask each other's names and not even needing to talk. Aimei kept listening to his laughter. What he said was not important or consistent, but his eyes contained profound meaning. Tuolei suddenly asked, "How about we leave here?" Aimei quickly said, "Oh, no, no, the guests are just arriving one by one." Tuolei said, "I know, but... please..." Aimei seemed to have lost consciousness. She was caught off guard, and by the time she realized it, the two of them were already sitting on a bus. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Key Points of the Latest Hospital Architectural Designs (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ji Piao</p>
<p>The responsibility of establishing a hospital lies in helping the world and saving lives. In this era of advancing culture, building hospitals is an essential task. However, hospital architecture is truly a place for the implementation of science and applied technology. All plans are more complex than other buildings. Therefore, designers should first have knowledge of hospital equipment. At the same time, they must have detailed discussions with experienced hospital administrators before proceeding. Otherwise, they will be like blind men leading blind horses, unable to start. The following are the key points in the latest hospital designs, briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Bed Allocation: Beds are provided to meet the needs of patients. Those wishing to build a hospital must predetermine the number of beds. However, the situation varies from place to place, and needs also differ accordingly. Generally speaking, based on statistics from prosperous cities, there should be one internal medicine/surgical bed, one infectious disease bed, one pediatric bed, and one obstetrical bed for every 2,000 residents. However, this ratio is subject to change for four reasons: (1) Epidemic outbreaks; (2) Different social situations; (3) Different population growth rates; (4) The number of hospitals. Therefore, to make accurate statistics, a detailed investigation must be conducted first.</p>
<p>(2) Site Selection: The most important aspect is site selection. If the location is appropriate, everything is easier to solve. Therefore, attention should be paid to several factors when selecting a site:</p>
<p>A (Quiet): It should be away from railroads, factories, busy streets, and public gathering places such as churches, schools, sports fields, and markets.</p>
<p>B (Fresh Air): It should avoid places with smoke and foul odors, such as manufacturing plants, train stations, and unpaved main roads.</p>
<p>C (Few Insects): It should be away from stables, warehouses, ponds, and wet, dirty areas.</p>
<p>D (Suitable Scenery): The scenery should be quiet and not noisy, elegant and pleasant, so that patients can relax their minds. Therefore, fields, forests, and distant mountains are suitable as natural scenery.</p>
<p>E (Sunlight Orientation): A site should be selected that allows the arrangement of patient rooms to receive at least some sunlight every day.</p>
<p>F (Permanence): Avoid areas that could become commercial or industrial centers in the future.</p>
<p>G (Future Expansion): The rate of future development is unpredictable. Land should be prepared for expansion to twice the current size.</p>
<p>H (Convenient Transportation): Although the above mentions being away from commercial and industrial centers, it should not be too remote. Otherwise, the transportation of patients and supplies will be difficult.</p>
<p>(3) Arrangement of Various Sections</p>
<p>A (Administration Department): This is the head of the entire plan. The plan should include a warm welcome, close friendship, and sincere hospitality to increase its development power.</p>
<p>1. Entrance Hall: Should include an information desk, public telephone, reception room, public restrooms, etc.</p>
<p>2. Offices: General office, individual offices, meeting rooms, etc.</p>
<p>3. Business Office: Patient registration room, maternity monitoring room, medical guidance room, etc.</p>
<p>4. Social Services Department: Staff offices, library, emergency room, patient transport entrance, examination room, etc.</p>
<p>B (Public Area): The public area's stairs, corridors, etc., should be located in the center of the building for easy access.</p>
<p>1. Corridors: Corridors leading to public and private patient rooms should be at least eight feet wide. This width allows two beds to pass side by side. If the corridor is longer, the width should also be increased. Patients, visitors, doctors, and nurses must all pass through the corridors. In each floor's corridor, there should be a small room of 6 feet x 7 feet for pushing in beds. Natural light and ventilation are important requirements in the corridors and should be considered.</p>
<p>2. Stairs: Must be located in the central part for easy access. There should be at least two for sufficient use. The width of the stairs cannot be less than four feet. Wall-mounted handrails should be installed. The height of each step should be less than 7 inches, and the width should not be less than 10 inches.</p>
<p>3. Elevators: Used to transport patients from patient rooms to the operating room. The size should be based on accommodating the bed, nurses, and elevator operator. Therefore, 6 feet x 8 inches is suitable. There should be a space in front of the elevator. The walls should be made of wood strips and lime, so that the mechanical sound does not transmit to the corridor and enter the patient rooms. It can also be used as a waiting area to avoid congestion in the corridor.</p>
<h3>Recent Building Situation in Hangzhou City</h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Hangzhou City is the provincial capital of Zhejiang Province and a historical city in our country. How is the construction industry doing within the city's area of 23.2 li in length and 36 li in width? I think everyone is eager to know! Now, let me report to you the recent building situation in Hangzhou City!</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a city depends on its population. Due to the increasing population of Hangzhou City over the years, the construction of residential buildings has developed more rapidly than other industries. Let's not compare the population of Hangzhou City in ancient times, but even compared to the population after the Revolutionary Army established Zhejiang Province, it will surprise us. According to the survey in October of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], the city's population was only 380,031. In the 17th year [1928], it was 451,147. In the 18th year [1929], it was 474,228. In the 19th year [1930], it increased to 506,930. In the 20th year [1931], it was 523,569. In the 21st year [1932], it decreased slightly to 522,529. In the 22nd year [1933], it increased again to 529,163. And according to the survey in September of last year, the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], it has reached 546,434. With such rapid population growth in these eight years, it is clear that the construction industry has flourished. Therefore, the increase in population and the need for construction in Hangzhou City are inevitable facts.</p>
<p>In the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the construction of houses in Hangzhou City included 461 ordinary residential buildings, covering an area of 87,760.00 square meters, with a value of 1,068,830.00 yuan; 271 stores, covering an area of 33,120.00 square meters, with a value of 536,420.00 yuan; 56 factory buildings, covering an area of 13,280.00 square meters, with a value of 135,950.00 yuan; 5 public buildings, covering an area of 670.00 square meters, with a value of 18,000.00 yuan; 6 schools, covering an area of 2,140.00 square meters, with a value of 20,000.00 yuan; 1 entertainment venue, covering an area of 10.00 square meters, with a value of 400.00 yuan; and 65 other buildings, covering an area of 6,930.00 square meters, with a value of 119,670.00 yuan. The total construction area reached 141,770.00 square meters, with a total construction value of 1,396,493.00 yuan. And last year, according to the city government's report, from January to October, the construction area reached 140,460 square meters, with a total construction value of 1,795,500 yuan. A total of 782 permits were issued, an increase of about 400,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The report on classified construction only includes figures from January to June, including 297 ordinary residential buildings, covering an area of 55,730.00 square meters, with a value of 55,760.00 yuan; 121 stores, covering an area of 28,103.00 square meters, with a value of 217,770.00 yuan; 17 factory buildings, covering an area of 6,650.00 square meters, with a value of 76,550.00 yuan; 2 public buildings, covering an area of 460.00 square meters, with a value of 6,700.00 yuan; 4 schools, covering an area of 3,120.00 square meters, with a value of 92,700.00 yuan; and 40 other buildings, covering an area of *940.00 square meters, with a value of 81,670.00 yuan. If we compare it with the first half of the 22nd year, the construction in the first half of last year did not show any decline or reduction. This is due to the rapid increase in population, the renovation of various administrative and commercial institutions, and large-scale construction. At the same time, modern buildings tend to be luxurious, and the increase in construction value is naturally greater than before. Looking at the amount of house tax collected by the municipal government, it has only increased year after year without any significant decline. The income from house tax in the 16th year was 98,895.46 yuan, in the 17th year it was 398,703.53 yuan, in the 18th year it was 443,007.72 yuan, in the 19th year it was 497,593.36 yuan, in the 20th year it was 473,262.81 yuan, and in the 21st year it was 474,659.47 yuan. Last year, from January to October of the 23rd year, the income decreased significantly to only 188,337.115 yuan. However, this is not due to a decrease in population or a decline in construction, but rather due to the sluggish market and the withering of various industries and commerce, resulting in closures and suspensions of business. This has affected the income from house tax, leading to a decrease. According to the statistics of the city treasury's income, it accounts for 39.63%, ranking first!</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also see that the Bureau of Public Works built new roads from January to October of last year, including Shita'er Road, Qingtai Road, Xizhao Road, Guohuo Road, Sudi Roundabout, Xuxi Road, Maolong Road, Jiuxi Shibajian Road, Siyan Road, and Shuixi Road, completing a total of 26,827 square meters of road surface. These new roads facilitate transportation, which is a fact. However, the development of the construction industry is one of the main reasons for the construction of new roads! As mentioned above, the rise and fall of a city is based on its population, and the increase in population promotes the development of the construction industry. Therefore, the fact that the construction value of Hangzhou City increased last year compared to the previous year is a good sign. Facts tell us that the forward development of construction under the current trend has many evidences, and the construction of Hangzhou City is just one example.</p>
<p>Secondly, we also need to know about real estate, which is closely related to the construction industry. In the past, the land price per mu in the Shuishui Bridge, Qinghefang, Yangbatou, and Sanyuanfang areas of Hangzhou City's commercial center was generally 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Now, due to the development of the construction industry, it has soared by 80% to 90%. According to recent estimates, the price per mu in Shuishui Bridge is 30,000 yuan, and in Qinghefang and Yangbatou it is about 20,000 yuan. Even in Zhongqing Street and Jianqiao Street, the center of the lower city, the land price per mu is about 10,000 yuan. As for the land price in the urban area, the highest price per mu in the Xinmin Road area was more than 2,000 yuan in the 12th year of the Republic [1923], but now it is 7,000 to 8,000 or even 10,000 yuan. The land price outside the urban area has also risen as high as in the urban area and the commercial center. Now, the municipal government is actively building roads and improving facilities, with the aim of prospering Hangzhou City. Therefore, the future value of real estate is just beginning to flourish, and it may soon rise again.</p>
<h3>Psychological Design of Factory Buildings (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>As for the distance between factories, the most important thing is to be economical. If the distance is too far, the workers will waste too much unnecessary energy going back and forth.</p>
<p>2.  Reserve sufficient open space for workers to rest: Fatigue is the venomous snake of work, which can reduce work efficiency to the minimum. Therefore, enlightened factories in Europe and America allow workers to have short breaks in the factory, ranging from three to five minutes.</p>
<p>However, the most important condition for rest is to get away from the workplace, so that their eyes are refreshed and their minds are open, making it easier to restore fresh energy. I often see that when workers in Chinese factories take breaks, they still stay in the factory, which is very psychologically inappropriate.</p>
<p>However, in cities, land prices are too high and spacious open spaces are hard to come by. Then, when designing, wider corridors or aisles should be left outside the factory for workers to rest.</p>
<p>(3) Internal Equipment: Once the external outline has been completely determined, the internal equipment must be discussed:</p>
<p>1.  Lighting: Psychologists have done many experiments on lighting, and we can briefly describe their results:</p>
<p>The light coming in from windows and skylights should not be directly facing the workers' eyes, as this is enough to distract them. The color of the walls should be light yellow and not too smooth, so as to avoid reflection. The lighting at night is best built into dark lines. If this is not possible, then the light bulbs should be milky white and not shine directly on the workers' eyelids.</p>
<p>2.  Noise Avoidance: The noisy sounds emitted by machines are most disturbing to the workers' minds, easily making them tired and weakening their nerves. This is the most uneconomical thing in work! When building, efforts should be made to reduce disturbing noises in the room to a minimum, which is really a meritorious act.</p>
<p>3.  Ventilation: According to the research of the New York Ventilation Association: in public places with many people, the air exhaled from the mouth and the heat radiated from the body can increase the indoor temperature as much as possible, which can make people tired, sleepy, headache, and irritable. This is of course even worse in the factory. Because in addition to the heat generated by the workers themselves, there is also the heat generated by the machines, so the ventilation equipment in the factory is really urgent?</p>
<p>The above points, although very brief, although very superficial, are very important. If those who build factories can pay attention to them one by one, the welfare of the workers will certainly increase, and the benefits of the factory owners will certainly be very great.</p>
