<h3>英美排斥華蛋感言</h3>

<p>蛋品在我國出口貨中向居重要地位歐戰以後行銷於歐美日本者爲數甚鉅絲茶而外堪稱大宗蓋歐美各國對於鮮蛋及蛋製品之需要夙稱股切而其本國所產以供不應求故在曩昔咸免稅獎勵其輸入查美國一九一三年稅則對鮮蛋進口完全免稅流質蛋每磅徵稅美金二分乾蛋品每磅徵稅美金六分英國於蛋類進口已往亦完全免稅據關冊統計我國鮮蛋及蛋製品出口總值在民國十九年曾達七千九百七十餘萬元之紀錄其後美英對華蛋輸入陸續增稅我國之輸出總值於二十年卽减至五千八百八十餘萬元二十一年减至四千四百三十餘萬元前年又减至三千六百四十餘萬元去年則僅三千零二十餘萬元前後五年相差已逾一倍影響所及我國內蛋價繼續下落往年鮮蛋價格春季每擔自十七八元至二十一元夏季自十五六元至十七八元秋冬因消耗較大其價較漲約在二十元至二十七八元之間近年則春季祇十四五元夏季僅十一二元秋冬雖　旺市亦不過十五六元至二十一二元以去年而論蛋價大跌之損失估計達一千萬元以上查去年鮮蛋出口約爲三萬四五千噸其中由華商之茂昌中央利寰三家輸出者僅及三分之一而營業結果大率虧耗今年存貨擁積外銷呆滯政府有免稅出口之救濟然而瞻望前途尙難樂觀</p>
<p>頃者國外消息傳來美議院又提議增加蛋類銷售稅乾蛋白須再加三角一分合計每磅稅美金五角八分徵至貨價一倍以上乾蛋黃亦加三角一分合計每磅稅美金五角八分徵至貨價四倍以上又流質蛋亦加一角五分共稅美金二角六分約當貨價二倍以上英下院對於我流質蛋之輸入曾作不良評詆指爲出產污穢母鷄食料不潔不合於人類消費報紙且載某徵蘭學家化騐樣品後杜撰之報告據謂其中含有過多之徵菌成分其某一次之化騐曾在一平方生的密達上發現生存之徵菌至一萬五十萬枚之多故未可視爲滿意之產品此項評詆當然出於英國家禽協會之促迫雖經該國衛生大臣之一再答辯並由病理學家於愼重檢查後繕具報告認爲適合淸潔純粹之美滿標準且亦與「A」級牛奶所需要關於徵菌之標準相合然其民間則已因此蓄意排斥矣</p>

<h3>意匈奧三國代表　續在威尼斯會談　以技術問題為主結果良好　意謀折衷辦法承認匈要求</h3>
<p>意大利威尼斯　意奧匈三國會議、於今晨十時半舉行第二次會議、至午後一時始畢、聞今晨會議所討論者、以技術問題為主、結果較為良好、意國謀取折衷辦法、承認匈國軍備平等之要求、並允許向匈國購買若干農產物、以示優惠、因此匈國已表示讓步、允許出席羅馬九國會議、惟此說並未徵實、蓋威尼斯會議討論經過、均嚴守秘密也、談判難關、似仍存在、三國會議現定明日舉行第二次會議、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>法報評論一斑</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國各報對於意奧匈三國威尼斯會議、尠加批評、間有若干報紙發表評論、則均深慮匈牙利所提出之要求、（卽要求重整軍備、並由國聯會行政院下屆會議、解决馬賽匈案責任問題等、）或竟為意大利所贊成、如名記者聖　里士在「白日報」發表評論、中謂「意國力圖解脫其舊日之約束、固能至何程度、意國固能使匈國加入中歐組織、而獲得一種方式、以保障奧國獨立否乎、」斐加羅報記者多爾美松謂多瑙河問題、極為複雜、希望法意兩國具有堅强意志、以保障奧國之獨立云、「新時代報」則謂「意國實處左右兩難之地位、蓋如支持匈牙利、則必招小協商三國之不滿、如反對匈牙利之主張、則又恐驅使匈國投入國社主義之懷中、二者實難兼全也、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報評詆　法蘇互助協定　稱為對德軍事聯盟　意在準備世界戰爭</h3>
<p>（柏林）今日德國各報一致評詆五月二日在巴黎簽定之法俄互協協定、稱為對德之軍事聯盟、足以危害歐州之和平、並謂正約之外、尙秘密訂有「輔助約文」、某報載有一說、謂蘇俄如須出兵、助法抗德、羅馬尼亞外相蒂台萊斯科允俄兵假道羅境云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國外交部人士、認為法蘇互助條約、係對於德國之一種直接威脅、謂除互助條約之外、法蘇兩國更訂有秘密軍事同盟、其目的專在對付德國、法國並貸欵五十萬萬法郎、以充蘇聯軍費云、德國各報則謂、俄國空軍已在捷克建造飛機塲、羅馬尼亞則與蘇聯訂約、准許蘇聯軍隊通過羅國領土云、又謂法蘇互助條約、在國聯會範圍之內、加以實施、因此愈增德國對於國聯會之嫌惡、國聯會在法俄兩國之壓迫下、從此將益復肆無忌憚矣、日耳曼尼亞報、則謂「法蘇互助公約、顯然為專對某一國家而設、此為戰前同盟觀念復活之先聲、可為寒心、此舉對於德國及歐洲、有嚴重之影饗、實為吾人所深悉、德國必設法加以報答」云、民衆觀察報則責備法蘇、謂其用意在準備世界戰爭、並謂「法國之極端國家主義政策、勢必使全歐渲染布爾希維主義而後已、蓋英國外相西門日前宣稱、英國重申對於羅卡諾條約之義務後、如法國助俄攻德、則英國必採取反對法國之立塲、莫斯科方面聞西門此語、不勝憤激、故乃與法國訂結攻守同盟」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>減秒俄日衝突</p>
<p>（柏林）德國當局今日對於法俄兩國之軍事聯盟、大不贊成、某要員向美聯社稱「此係重返戰前之軍事條約制度而已、德國對於此種制度、竭力反對、並不信軍事聯盟為有裨和平」云、同時莫斯科、巴黎甚至華盛頓各方、皆盛贊法俄條約之最後能得簽字、實為維持歐洲和平之一大進步、法國外長賴伐爾在巴黎宣布、彼將於下星期携帶東歐公約之草稿、假道柏林、前往華沙及莫斯科、賴氏雖稱彼之假道柏林、係欲節省時間、並不希望德國當避忌與彼會晤、然觀察者以為賴氏此行、或能打開法德交涉之局面、法俄兩國將邀請波蘭及捷克參加防守互助公約、已為公開之事實、且法俄條約不限他國加入、故德國或將被邀、亦未可知、惟最近法俄當局、皆曾公開表示反對德國元首希特勒之國社黨政府、故若干觀察者信、希氏於五月中旬英德海軍會議舉行之前、將不作任何交涉云、華盛頓方面之政治觀察者、及若干官員、則以為法俄條約實有裨和平、並能影響及於遠東、蓋蘇俄在歐洲方面如與他國衝突、已可得法國之援助、則其對付日本之地位、當更為穩固、美國戰略家以為祇須俄國應付歐洲之實力充足、俄日衝突之危險、卽能减少、猶憶最近德日亦有締結聯盟對付蘇俄之謠、此事德日雙方皆已絕端否認、且自中東路交涉結束之後、俄日邦交亦已大為改進矣云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>俄報一致讚揚</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今日蘇聯各報對於法蘇公約簽訂事均加評論、眞理報社論謂、此項互助公約之締結、不僅為蘇法兩國勞動羣衆所滿意、且為一切擁護和平者所歡迎、重工業委員會機關報「工業社報」稱、此項公約為法蘇兩國提携新而重要之步驟、且為彼等在增進和平途中之偉大成功、此項協定乃由偉大而强有力之國家簽訂、故於抱有侵略行經之徒、必有偉大之「預言性的」重要性、換言之、彼必能作為一種警吿也、彼等須不斷感覺法蘇兩國願將此項公約變成一種不知拒絕為何物之工具、」該報並謂法蘇政治親善之下、復須奠以適當的經濟基礎、「蘇聯與和平奮鬥之中、已獲得極大成功、此共原因乃在蘇聯以其經濟的防禦力量、已成國際上最偉大之國家、凡各國企求和平之羣衆、對此莫不抱有同情焉、」共靑團中央委員會靑年眞理報稱、此項公約正與蘇聯全部政策、及其與各國所訂協定同樣、其唯一目的乃在和平、乃在約束歐洲挑釁之徒、並鞏固力量、以協助蘇聯乃至全歐洲及全世界之安全」云、「四日塔斯電」</p>

<p>陝西古稱沃野千里、四塞（卽蕭·武·函谷·大散·四關、故陝省又號關中、）險固、今亦綰毅西北、形勢頗為重要、慨自東北淪亡、開發西北呼聲、一時風起雲湧、漸已進為事實、陝西自以史地優越關係、形成開發西北過程中建設之重心、中央地方及金融實業各界、均一致予以注意及助力、故其建設事業之進展、大有蒸蒸日上之勢、惟各方認定建設基本工作、急其所急、一為水利之整理、足以增加生產、而復甦農村經濟、二為交通之開發、俾農作生產原料、暢達濱海出口市塲、是故陝西年來建設工作、實已在水利交通上、日益著其成績撮要分述如下、</p>
<p>（甲）水利建設方面　（一）涇惠渠、原由陝省政府及華洋義賑會修築、二十二年洪水冲毀多處、繼又由全國經濟委員會估定修補費二十三萬九千餘元、從事改善引水設備、又總幹渠北幹渠修理等工程、均經全部完成、已可順利放水、南幹渠設計改良坡度、幷增修南一北一北四支渠三道、及延長南一支渠至涇河岸、架設灌溉區環境電話、以期交通靈活、本渠給水、除刻正增修三支渠不計外、計全年給水二百三十四日、每月平均最大給水量約為一三，八一秒立方公尺、最小給水量約九·五〇秒立方公尺、灌溉區域達涇陽三原高陵體泉臨潼五縣、已灌面積共五十六萬九千九百畝、除受水未享實惠地畝外、共約四十五萬三千餘畝、新修工程、今年全部完成、增加灌溉面積為六十萬畝、農產每畝收穫量、夏禾最豐者大麥三石、小麥一石七斗、菜子一石五斗、普通平均大麥一石八斗、小麥菜子各一石一斗、秋禾最豐者棉花近百斤、普通平均四五十斤、</p>
<p>（二）洛惠渠、由全國經濟委員會任其工事、目前正努力修築中、計總幹渠長二十一公里、中幹·東幹·西幹·中東·中西·各渠共長七十八公里、灌溉面積九百三十四方里、合五十萬零四千餘畝、應需工程及經常費兩項、一百四十六萬六千餘元、總幹渠工程、今夏可完成、其他中東西之幹渠支渠、各項工程、均預定在二十五年初夏竣工、</p>

<h3>三行暨銀錢兩業　今日會商放款</h3>
<p>决先辦信用放欵五百萬元　滬市銀根已漸鬆洋拆步跌</p>
<p>中央中國交通三銀行·曁銀行業同業公會·錢業同業公會等、定今日午後二時、會商二千萬滬工商業救濟放欵、一千五百萬抵押擔保放欵、决由中央中國交通三銀行分別擔任之、五百萬元信用保證放欵、除銀行業同業公會會員銀行、已認定一百八十八萬五千元、及錢業同業公會會員錢莊、認定二十五萬元、餘二百八十六萬五千元、决由中央等銀行擔任之、</p>
<p>先辦信用　新聲社記者昨回銀錢兩業探悉、抵押擔保放欵曁信用保證放欵、雖均為工商業所盼望早日實施者、但尤以信用保證放欵為最重要、因凡國貨工廠、如已有原箱貨物、向銀錢兩業抵押借欽、則較為容易、如經售國貨之商號、其貨物均須置在廚窗內、每日銷售、則必須信用保證借欵、故今决將五百萬元信用保證放欵先辦云、</p>
<p>銀根漸鬆　工商業之四月底過後、錢業市塲之洋拆行市、昨日上午下午兩市、均為一角二分、較前日又降二分、較四月底降八分、則可證滬市銀根已漸鬆、但預料江浙各地春繭上市時、因需欵較繁、故洋拆勢必再漲、此係每年必有之現象、</p>

<p>觀上表、本年度發行額之增加、仍以滬券為最多、蓋因江北內地機關擴增、滬券行使日遠之故、魯券島券烟券之推行、亦因業務發達、頗見平穩進展、漢券係於上年開始發行、深博漢皋人士之歡迎、厦券流通甫三閱月、亦着相當之成績、似前途均可樂觀、惟津券以流通區域較狹、故推展較難耳、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （楊燮理）</p>
<p>浙江義烏有兩句方言；「訓子堂前，敎夫房內」；「經訓千篇，庭訓千言，不及一句枕頭言」。</p>
<p>從前一句上看，我們覺得做妻子的責任眞是重大，非但要有敎育子女的能力，並且對於丈夫的過失，要婉言規勸，對於丈夫的事業，要盡量鼓勵，丈夫受了委曲，要加以體貼，竭力安慰，這樣才算是盡了「敎夫」的責任·</p>
<p>從後一句上看，妻子對於丈夫說的話，實在有意想不到之效力，世上往往有因妻子的一句話，弄得兄弟不睦，家庭失和，為人妻者，和丈夫的一言一語，應當要如何的謹愼呀！</p>
<h3>道南大宅</h3>
<p>— 宛松</p>
<p>京劇裏：「黃鶴樓」的主角，周　，和魯肅，凡是讀過三國演義的人，大槪沒有不曉得的吧？周瑜是舒城人，魯肅是廬江人，魯肅家裏很有錢，周瑜來靠他，他就把一所「道南大宅」，贈給了周瑜，這是歷史上記著的故事，他們的義氣，是多末可風啊！</p>
<p>但是「道南大宅」在什麽地方呢？我這回打從合肥到舒城，經過合肥的西鄉，才發現了他們的故里，和所謂「道南大宅」的所在：</p>
<p>在合肥西鄉九十多里的聚星集附近，有一座周公山，據說是因為周瑜得名的，在周公山附近，有一個瑜泉村，這就是周瑜的故里了，村南二三里路，有一　所道南書院，據說就是「道南大宅」的故址，我曾經在這所道南書院，住了一宿，它在深山之中，一段淸溪，四圍蒼翠，粉墻掩映，樓閣參差，風景的秀媚，可與江南山水媲美，本地人俗稱呌肥西書院，據說是合肥淮軍名將：劉壯肅，周剛敏，周武壯，張靖達，張勇烈，唐忠壯，唐果介，諸公，醵資建立的，在前淸的時候，許多莘莘學子，每月都樂在這個地方做月考，文風很盛！但是現在世家都沒落了，這座合肥文化中心的「道南書院」，也變成了整軍經武之塲，做了什麽聯保辦事處了，不過提起道南大宅的故事，在合肥是無人不知的，合肥的縣志，也有着這末一段紀載哩。</p>
<h3>石首魚</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>在春末夏初的時候，江浙沿海一帶，盛產一種魚類，體扁嘴闊，上覨長於下覨，鱗細，色黃如金；所以名喚「黃花魚」俗名黃魚」。因為它的頭部裏面，有二個石狀小塊；所以又呌做「石首魚」。</p>
<p>石首魚分大小兩種，大的重一二斤，油炸淸　，味都鮮美。小的長不及一尺，重只七八兩，肉不甚豐腴，祗可曝乾做鮝，名喚「自鮝一。又把它肉拌豬油：可製為「魚鬆」，小石首魚產量很多，所以售價極廉，有時候一二銅元可買一尾。在秋冬時候，這些小石首魚，因為產量很少，名喚「桂花黃魚」，每尾非一二角不能買了。吃的人，也以為價貴的味美，價賤時候不好吃，眞是笑話」。</p>
<p>在仲夏時候，小石首魚的腹內，往往生一種小蟲，蠕蠕而動，其數很多。吃的時候，應該洗滌盡凈，方可烹調佐膳。否則這些小蟲，吃入腹內，當然有害吓。</p>
<p>石首魚的肉富蛋白質用滷蝦瓜汁燉食，味很鮮美。拌麥粉，加小蘇打少許，可製炸魚球，調醋食之，是很好的點心。此外製鬆，曬鮝，石首魚的吃法多着呢。晋陸士龍答車茂安書道：「……鱠鰡　，灸　　，烝石首，臛　　，眞東海之俊味，肴膳之至妙也！」這時陸士龍在鄧縣三十餘日，所見海鮮很多，對於石首魚，也推崇備至也。（按鄭縣卽今之寗波，某君稱寗波為「魚城」，有以夫）。</p>

<h3>腿</h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>怪可憐的，我這兩條腿。</p>
<p>但，我這兩條腿，並不是和高貴人們東奔西跑的。</p>
<p>腿，給予人們便利的；不過坐在我身上，未免太可憐了；因為無論遠在十里八里的路程，都有勞這兩條腿跑。昨天，又從車站到寓所，由寓所到車站，來而復去的跑四次，足有十里遠的路程：雖然可憐我這條腿，但；不曾化掉一文車錢，却又可喜。</p>
<p>當我坐着休息的時候，時常捋起褲袖撫摩着，欣賞我自已的腿。</p>
<p>美？够不上稱讚，那黧黑的肌膚，堅硬而又野草般的毫毛，手接觸着腿，覺着刺痛，我僧惡，痛恨。用力挺直，多有勁，肌肉纍纍凸起，顯露着健康美，畢竟我這兩腿是可愛的；不過我自巳稱讚自已的腿是美的。</p>
<p>玉腿光澤，大約在稱讚女子的腿，是的，電影院里廣吿，時常看到的。據說：女子腿上還搽粉，對了，因了中國女子粉的消耗量廣大，所以國外輸入化裝品有驚人的可能，中國流出的金錢自然也多，管他媽的，只要玉腿光澤，有多數人稱讚，欣賞，顚倒，消魂，醉死，中國的金錢都流出國外，干伊屁事。</p>
<p>細膩的腿，光澤可愛，又抹上粉，香噴噴的，自然可以使人稱讚，顚倒，消魂，醉死。嘿……我的腿，够怕人的，誰都不會顚倒，消魂的；但我始終愛我自已的腿，因為能跑遠的路，更可省車錢。</p>
<p>女子的玉腿，可以顚倒衆生，我的腿能跑遠的路程，比較起來，自然我腿弗如了。</p>

<h3>蘇州的立夏節</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>四野綠陰迎夏至，」。在這一庭紅雨送春歸紅了櫻桃，綠了芭蕉的當兒，早巳春光老去。蘇州的立夏節，係人的節日，家家戶戶，都要買些應時食品，閻家大嚼，還有幾種俗例故事，須在立夏節當犬舉行。</p>
<p>立夏節頂大的事情，是「秤人；」將秤柴的大秤，懸掛在屋樑一面，闔家的人，一一吊着　鈞，在秤上秤着體重，手勁不佳的人，就在鈎上懸一隻挑東西的綳箍，然後人坐在箍上懸秤。至於小孩子，是放在籃裏秤的。秤人的舉動，據說是為避免「蛀夏；」然而我國人的身體，向來不加檢騐，秤人一端，可以檢查人身的體重，比較去年是孰重孰輕，使人得知身體的强弱，用意是很深長的。</p>
<p>立夏節，因與端午，中秋，同係人的節日，所以有幾種食物，是當天必不可少的。像菜肴中的鹹鴨蛋，黃魚，蠶豆等等。鹹鴨蛋，以前大都是人家自製的；在淸明節邊，將鴨蛋洗净後，另將食　，稻柴灰搗細，用酒和肉滷拌　。掉成漿糊般的濕滷然後金在　蛋殻外面，那　　就會沁人蛋內。吃的時候，將黑灰洗去，在飯鍋上蒸熟，在　這立夏節邊，鹹鴨蛋剛才成熟，滋味和淡，蛋黃中也含着蛋油，吃起來很好吃的。至於蠶豆和黃魚，也是新鮮的當令食品，立夏節菜肴中所少不掉的。</p>
<p>立夏節的零食，是最多的了：有酒釀，海　，麥蠶，櫻桃，　　薺，靑梅等等。酒釀的滋味，因略含酒質，吃在嘴裏，甜甜的怪有味兒，小孩子們最喜歡啖食。在立夏節邊，賣酒釀的所在，除了專售酒釀的店舖外，街頭上到處可見。海　，係海中的有殼動物，長長的殼，比螺絲略為細些，滋味却未見佳妙，吃起來也像螺　般的吸食，是很費力的。麥蠶是用新麥搗　製成的，爛爛的像靑泥，滋味也未見佳妙。蘇州的　　，是有名的土產，立夏節邊，眞是荸薺最好時季，削央了皮，吃在口裏十分甜嫩。立夏節邊的　　梅，小小的顆粒，尙未長成，滋味也很苦，不堪一嚼：然而習俗相沿，據說綴在頭上，可以不會「蛀夏」。</p>
<p>立夏節的食物中，還有一種奇怪食物，蘇州人家，是家家預備着在立夏節吃的。那食物是一塊瓦片餅，那餅是在淸明節那天買了來，用楊柳條串着，懸在通風所在吹乾的，到了立夏節，方才取下來分食衆人，那餅經長時的風吹，乾硬得像鐵石一般，然而因為要避免「蛀夏」起見，每個人都不能不略嘗一些。此外在大除夕放在門角落裏的「撑門炭，」（那也是蘇州的一種風俗，在廢歷除夕，將細條的木炭，用紅紙封着，放在各處門戶角落裏的），揀出來煎茶吃，據說這也是避免蛀夏的一種法兒。這些就是蘇州立夏節的風俗了。</p>
<h3>小天西</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>他們的窗戶，根本是墻上一個四方窟窿。就是有用木料做的格子，也是尺來見方的一格，試問這上面糊着紙，風括得破括不破呢？說到這層，我還鬧了一個笑話呢。就是我向那學生說，旣是屋子裏黑，點上燈在屋子裏抄，不比在外面强的多嗎？事後經人家點破，眞是一句何不食肉糜的笑話。那校長為讓我明白屋裏不點燈的原故，特意讓我晚半天再去一趟。在暮色蒼茫的時候，總算讓我趕到了他們的晚飯。不過那校長料定了我不能吃那苦，竟是不曾約我吃飯。那些學生們，像是很忽忙，各人趕着到廚房裏去，拿一碗小米揚出來。另一隻手拿了黑　，咬一口，喝一口小米湯，就在院子裏，用他們的晚餐。這我就明白了，他們為什麽要搶吃飯，正為的是要搶這一點蒼茫的晚光，免得在燈下吃飯。晚飯以後，二十來個學生所在的屋子裏，統共只有三盞燈，分在三個窗戶裏放出那淡黃色的光來。我索興到學生宿舍裏去看看，看到他們坑上那破舊的被褥，在細小的燈光下照着，彷彿就讓人戚到一種凄凉的意味。周有容道：二十多人學生，共兩三盞煤油燈，這自然，是不能念書，但不知道這燈油是歸學生自辦呢？還是出在學校裏呢？（一九七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>至於飲食方面，更是特別的優待，每餐也必有極豐盛的菜餚，給伊們享用，和太后所用的膳食一般都是由御廚房所承辦的；尋常當一個小官人家的宅眷用的臉食，那裏能比得上伊們？再加在進膳的時候，也有好幾個太監在旁邊給伊們端菜，盛飯，撤席，一些也不用伊們自己動手；就是伊們所住的臥房裏，每天也有小太監們輪流着進去收拾的，因此，伊們除掉為太后繡鳳鞋，裁製襪子以外，可說是一無所事了。這未免太優待了嗎？不過說穿了却是不値一笑的！原來這種刺繡的工作，若要求其光潔，對於藝工們的手指也有很大的關係；要是伊們的手指因為常和粗糙的東西接觸的緣故，弄得很粗糙了，那末繡起花朶來，那些絲線也不免要給伊們弄毛了。就為這樣，太后才不許伊們做別的工作的，倘非如此，伊們休想能有什麽太監來承値，少不得要敎伊們自己照料一切了！</p>
<p>據太后吿訴我，這些製鞋的藝工是極不容易培植的，通常每一個小女孩子，任憑怎樣的聰明伶俐，或者對於尋常的繡作工夫怎樣的精到熟練，但要進宮來為太后打鞋樣，繡鞋花，做襪子，却至少必須費三年的工夫去學習，不然是無從下手的！的確，像那樣繁複深奧的技術，依我看來，卽使學習了三年工夫，未必能完全精熱，未必就有良好的成續。我覺得非在學滿了三年，再專心從事於這項工作達四五年之久，便决不能深入堂奧，運用自如，因為有許多的秘訣，都不是一索卽得的。（三〇七）</p>

<h3>中華聯奪得中葡杯　已勝三年該杯遂為中華永有　昨戰成三比三和局驚險萬狀</h3>
<p>中葡朴昨在申園作第二次比賽、中華隊有姜瑯李寗等加入、陣綫極為齊整、但表演竟遠不如前、葡萄牙自上次失利後、整軍備武、决意報復、雖大將雷米狄缺席、但戰鬥力依然極强、中華始終受敵、岌岌可危、僥倖造成二比二和局、後又時來運來、以三比二佔優、最後三分鐘內、葡萄牙作成三比三和局、合計共中華一勝一和、本年之勝利、巳屬中華、查該杯歷史、葡勝一次、中勝三次、該杯遂成中華永有之紀念、但第三次比賽、仍繼續舉行、已定本星期日下午四時仍在申園舉行、以天熱關係、改以四十分鐘、調換方向、下年起將另製一杯、由度比賽云、茲將昨戰經過述下、</p>
<p>論形勢驚險萬狀　昨戰中華缺少聯絡、李寗　善敬表演均　甚平常、中　綫亦無特殊色彩、姜　魄力甚大、遞送美妙、惜與許文奎不能合作、賈幼良符質彬表演尙佳、孫錦順受對方監視甚嚴、鬱鬱不得志、形勢實不如對方、葡隊中衛綫異常强固、前鋒甚快、聯絡亦佳、下半時攻　益盛、中華四面受敵、危機四伏、半小時後、方見起色、遂能於惡劣之局面下、造成平手、</p>
<p>葡萄牙先發制人　三時有半、沈回春一聲號令、中華撥球先攻、浩浩蕩蕩、姜璐邊陲起義、踢而未中、孫錦順門側機關、被守門救出、葡隊揮軍　殺、考司坦高球遙遠門前、張榮才雙方抱住、法凡怯將共衝倒、成角球、法凡怯踢出甚佳、考司坦對門頭頂、拿脫加入一脚、應聲　入、</p>
<p>賈幼良還以顏色　中華一球旣失、全軍憤怒、立刻興師問罪、姜　急急傳中、孫錦順見機而作、奔前扣鬥、不意越門而過、十分可惜、二十分鐘時、江善敬受傷出塲敷藥、旋卽入塲、賈幼良遞球與符質彬、符追至底綫、救至門前、賈奔上側射、其勢甚猛、敵人束手無策、乃成和局、</p>
<p>葡萄牙猛攻不已　中華旣經收復失地、人心為之一安、許文奎雄心勃勃、力射擋回、姜　還擊、失之交臂、葡萄牙不肯甘休、法凡怯出　門前、猖獗行事、高球傳中、李寗頭項、　成不救、幸貢山夫頭頂不中、法凡怯再度來犯、斜刺遠射中鵠、但右翼越位、徒費心血、</p>
<p>張榮才化險為夷　再戰聲起、中華雖力車振作、無奈對方監視甚嚴、仍無起色、葡軍攻勢益猛、李江招架為難、孫錦順雖一度孤軍奮鬥、一事無成、貢山夫得法凡性之傳球、地位極佳、但球彈手上被罰、法凡怯捲土重來、又中一球、但又以羅柴洛越位不計、考司坦突放冷箭、球勢甚急、張榮才不慌不忙、雙手抱住、化險為夷、博得全塲掌聲如雷、</p>
<p>柯拉沙又中要害　斯時可謂葡萄牙之全盛時代、圍困中華、聯珠怒發、使中華守衛、顧此失彼、　於奔命、幾乎祇有招架之能、而無反攻之力、劇戰至半小時、卒被柯拉沙攻入一球、是球柯得力於貢山夫、連奔　躥、聲　汹汹、穿過李寗、殺至門前、一射中的、中華遂又以一比二屈居人下、觀此形勢、咸以為中華必敗無疑、安知風雲變幻、令人莫測、中華後勁可畏、忽又得勢矣、</p>
<p>質彬姜璐雙貢獻　葡隊以二對一再度領前、中華隊不廿雌服、不二分鐘、賈幼良沿邊直入、橫傳敵門前、符質彬從右路趕到、趁勢力射、球由左角竄入網底、四座觀衆、莫不敬佩中華隊用軍之神速、入後中華球勢轉旺、姜　的是名將、匹馬單槍、繞道而入、亦建一功、此球踢來淸晰美觀、中華隊反以三對二佔先、</p>
<p>考斯坦　成和局　　軍　一失冉失、士氣並不稍餒、然中華健兒、忽　倦態、葡軍乃乘機反攻、球常在中華門前、盤桓不去、在臨終前五分鐘時、法凡却得機攻門、守門張　才　起過早、接球未得、球落右方、考斯坦乘隙一掃、應聲而入、造成三對三之和局、</p>

<h3>出席國際運動會　中華預選昨日結束　錢行素女士又敗於李森</h3>

<p>千五公尺　王正林放棄、八百公尺冠軍賈連仁、初次試跑此項競賽以四分卅十秒三得第一、成　雖屬平平、但步伐之優美、衝刺之雄壯、假以時日、必大有作為、在前二圈半中、買蟄居末二、徐二下一馬放前、領先有一二十公尺、最後四百公尺時賈邁步前進、脚步寬大、直至終點、勝第二名管友文有四十公尺之遙、先前居首之徐一　、反落殿軍、</p>
<p>中欄預賽　原為日前下午之節目、因時間關係、移至昨日舉行、又因時問及恐賽員精力不濟、祗預賽而未决賽、以預賽成績、評定優劣、作為選擇標準、第一組陶英　第一、從容不迫、以無競爭之人、成績减色、祗六四秒一、第一組孫惠培以六三秒五得勝、李厚達六二秒八、假如舉行決賽、則孫陶李當有一番競爭也、</p>
<p>田賽三項　以跳高成績較為可觀、許文奎朱文極羅斗文及陳天和四人、同時跳過最後高度一米七四五、因係預選性　、為節省時間計、未另行決賽、故並列第一、上列四人、均屬可造之材、加至一米七九五時、均有　過希望、以些微之接觸、　落　木、甚為　惜、　餅宮萬育僅得卅三公尺七三、第二黃　谷卅二公尺十五、第三馬春元卅二公尺十三五、第四程必春僅卅一公尺六八五、掌竿跳人數極少、二米九十起點、即殺下二人、以後三人爭王禾以三米四五冠軍、</p>

<h3>暹罗米在中国食粮中之地位</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>一月前報載有粵省糧食調節會擬禁止暹米入口，既而復有較綏實行之說。曾幾何時；華僑聯合會亦爲暹羅壓迫華僑日益加甚，有非抵制暹米，難期暹人覺悟，而向各方作呼籲。以言暹羅與中國之關係，發生最早，即論其民族，亦與　南方民族爲相近，在海禁未開以前，我粵閩人士之赴暹者　踵相接，箄路襤褸之功，我華人有焉。乃自暹之一部分人與日人相聯結，屢對我華作不利之舉，最近之壓迫華僑，幾欲非完全同化於暹人不可，此則用意殊深，尤不可以等閒　之。</p>
<p>暹羅盛產米，故米價常賤：粵閩則缺米，故米價恒貴，因以暹米濟我之窮，清初已然。大致暹米以銷於粤港者爲多。廈門　海次之，北方之天津，所銷亦無多。暹米身質較好，其價貴。上海雖爲洋米銷路一大巨區，能食價高之米者寗食粳米；不能致者，又寗取價賤之西貢小絞諸米　食之，因此暹米在滬上，其他位爲不足重。然在粤省每年所賴以袖其米糧之不足者，洋米約居其七，本米約居其三，此七成之洋米中暹米自不在少數。　暹羅出口貨，亦以米爲大宗，出口之米又以運銷於我國者占多數。故　我國不購食其米，則此大宗剩糧，日本恐亦愛莫能助，爲之銷納，是　暹羅經濟必應受相當之影響矣。</p>
<p>在我，設一旦而實行不食暹米，所加於我民食者其影響爲如何？此則應當求之於進口暹米在我進口米糧中之地位如何？愚嘗就　冊而爲統計之，自民國以來，除民九因日人競冒之結果無進口外，歷年進口之暹米，以民國二十二年之七，五五一，五五四擔爲最多，元年之　九五　擔爲較少，進口最多之年，約占進口洋米總量之百分之三〇有奇。然以二十二年　暹米進口之數量合計之，亦不過爲二四，一五九，一〇〇擔，不及洋米總進口數之共計二七〇，二九四，二〇九擔之　　。但如民國二十一年進口之暹米其數實不再少。我人因此要加以注意，民　至二十年，關　所載之暹米進口數量，恐行大部分暹米或已列人香港進口之內。故如民國二十一·一年關　所載安南暹羅內地進口之米，皆有特殊之增加，　香港進口之米，忽見非常之減縮，故一　，非爲量之　遷，而爲海關行政手續之改變，漸注重於原產地之故要非無因。則什民國二十年以前，香港進口之米中，必有一大部分爲暹羅安南米焉明甚。果如此說．暹米之運銷於我華者數不在少；然亦未必占甚重要之地位，蓋中國所銷之米，仍以安南米爲大宗也。</p>
<p>去爲力保國族起見，雖有犧牲，亦所不惜；何况抵制一部分之食米，不難另籌抵補，原不必斤斤考量。惟應注意者，粤　素食暹米，又與香港密邇，能實行其澈底工作否，如曰不能，非惟無益，徒以賈怨，則何如另闢溪徑之爲得。但我爲暹人計，毋以中國貧弱爲可欺，毋以冰山叮恃爲無礙，不念　人相與開闢之功，頓忘親如睦鄰之誼，亦未見其計之得也。至欲獨增暹米進口稅，以爲抵制，既爲目前形勢所不許。正不必多此一說。下表即自民國元年至二十二年進口暹米與進口洋米之總數量相對照也。（單位擔）</p>

<h3>「棉業網」之新設計</h3>
<p>— 朱仙舫</p>
<p>生產，爲經濟建設要圖。國家由土地人民統治權三要素結集　建立必運用政權，導人民於其領土爲生產建設，能以所產供國民全體之需；史以其餘易其所無，而充國用，或　他國之需，而易其財，始可由國民經濟富裕，而厚具國力。現代國家縱橫　圖，求爭雄長於世界，厚增戰爭，必先之以增厚經濟，而以導領國民發揮生產，爲增厚經濟之厚。吾國生產落後，國民生活需要之物，成於農者，若米麥棉不能盡白供給，而必給自國外。成於工者，資以爲工之機械，屬重工業者無論矣；即輕工業成品　年由國外輸入之量，展閱海關貿易數字；至是足刺目。由平衡輸入差額之現銀外溢之鉅，而致農村衰落，及於工商，進而影響金融業，整個經濟　罩於不景氣之嚴重狀態中，國力脆　，已爲全國人十共知之事實。蔣委員長於剿共之餘，歷睹農村衰落，思昭蘇之，有國民經濟建設之籌謀，可謂適中時需，得與復經濟，以與復民族之眞諦者矣。顧農工爲生產唯一分子，而亦爲策勵經濟獨一之源。農之經濟建設運動，在盡吾廣十平原山林川澤，充其生產效能；工之經濟建設運動，在盡吾農產原料，爲工業品之製成，更將工能成其爲工之機械，亦悉自成之，全國所需，能以自產者供之，而不外求，爲最終目的。惟類別繁復，必考慮詳審，第其先後，分途並進，事始易舉。今就資以製衣之布，即所謂棉業一項，展視過去衰落原因，及今後建設動嚮，進而爲棉業網設計，以爲國民經濟建設運動項目中一得之計。</p>
<p>吾國棉業衰落，以生產費用不能低減爲重要因素，都會紡織工廠甚。蓋近代工業，莫不競尚低减生產費用。生產費與原料之總和，爲其成品價值。生產費低，原料價廉，則成品之值，亦因是而低廉。廉價物品，自易銷售。但物價之廉否，係比較出之，以廉者與尤廉者較，廉者亦不見其廉，　紗價值　以廉爲其比較對象者爲日紗，則莫之能敵。加之天災匪亂，農村破產深刻，購買力弱，需要之物，亦唯擇廉價之日貨購之。而吾華紗廠，更以都會爲易於資金運轉，羣集於此，又爲造成困難之原因。分析視之，則有下列各端：</p>
<p>（一）受在華外廠之傾　；</p>
<p>（二）外貨傾銷，政府無法拒絕；</p>
<p>（三）農村購買力弱，擇價廉者購買；</p>
<p>（四）資本薄弱，利息負擔綦重；</p>
<p>（五）人才不充，不能盡其技術妙用；</p>
<p>（六）機械　　，生產不能提高，消費不能節減；</p>
<p>（七）錠數過於集中，華商同業，不免相自排擠，</p>
<p>就由（四）（五）（六）項尤爲在華日廠制勝華廠之所在，蓋日廠多由其國內成績素著資金雄厚之公司所分設，即營運資金．亦不仰金融機關之調劑，利息負擔至微。中上級工務昌，歷經陶冶，於技術夙富經騐。機械則成於現代者爲多。用能生產增加，消費節减。而尤受優惠者，則爲工潮不易釀成，因有領事裁判權維護，即有發生，亦不難鎭懾制止，得以安心工作，盡力生產，凡此均非華廠所可及。欲解免之，則</p>
<p>（一）（二）受縛於國際不平等條約而不可能。</p>
<p>（三）農村迭經災祲匪亂，難即反繁榮舊觀，不能強之不擇廉價外貨購買。</p>
<p>（四）（五）（六）屬整個金融及教育問題，非急切所能改善。</p>
<p>可行之有效，唯將（七）之集中機械，分散內地，設立工廠，以爲紡織工業之經濟碉堡，堅壁清野，拒絕外貨紗布侵入。查吾國紡織工廠，大權集中通商大埠，茲將全國紡錠分佈，表示如下：</p>

<p>據上表，上海華商有錠一百十四萬七千餘枚，連日商計之，爲二百六十三萬九千餘錠，合江蘇全省各廠計之，爲三百二十二萬四千餘錠。漢口華商錠數爲三十一萬一千餘，連日商爲三十三萬五千餘。天津凡二十九萬三千餘錠。山東華商僅九萬九千餘錠，日商有三十六萬五千餘錠。故全國紡錠分佈，除山東華商佔錠較少外，餘均集中上海漢口天津；而以上海爲尤甚，超過全國華洋商總錠數之半，華商錠數，亦及全國華商總錠數之四成。就都會較優於內地之點言之，則（一）秩序安定，（二）金融活潑，（三）交通便利，（四）熟工易致，（五）營業爽利。就其不利之點言之，則（一）地價昂貴，（二）房捐地稅及一切雜支過重，（三）工資較高，工人來去無定，難於管理，（四）原料價值較高，（五）成品賣價較低，（六）同業間營業　爭較烈。由上列都會工廠所占之優點，與其不利之點，比較論列，則公安固以都會較內地爲良，然自九一八，一二八後，全國人心轉變，懍於外侮日亟，而內戰之事，已不再見，匪共肆亂，漸告肅清，地方政府，更類能保護生產事業，予以便利，一反軍閥割據時代之所需，則設廠內地，於公安自可得所保障，不亞於都會。營業方面，最關重要者，爲自盡運轉，自現金集中都會，成畸形繁榮後，金融業亦漸移其視綫於內地，謀興復農村，推動經濟，則設於內地之工廠，自不虞資金不易調劑。至花紗買賣，及生產費用所繁之消費，內地工廠較都會有獨占優勝者在，特分條言之於後：</p>
<p>（一）地價低廉，較都會爲可一之比，設廠之固定資金可减。</p>
<p>（二）營業雜費較輕。</p>

<p>（四）原棉採購便易，較都會工廠，可省運輸利息保險佣金等費，每担由一元至十餘元。</p>
<p>（五）都會紗廠，砍廣招徠，購其成品運銷內地，賣價必較內地工廠爲低，恒在四五元以上。</p>
<p>以上（一）（二）（三）項爲內地工廠，于消費得較都會爲節省。蓋地價低廉，則固定資金之利息可輕，雜費較微，勞工質率較低，則經常支出可減，均足影響生產費用，而使成品價格低降。至（四）（五）原料與銷路，尤爲發展棉業要道，內地亦均良于都會。則都會工廠，求避免在華外廠傾軋，得地利之優患，均必依原料產量，爲適應公佈。上海與江蘇其他各縣，共有紡錠三百廿二萬四千餘錠。江蘇全省棉產量，廿三年爲一百六十六萬四千餘担，各縣紗廠，多在棉產區設，立得就地採棉、上海紗廠，則以原棉不敷紡錠之需，多採自他省，補其差額，於是上述每捐較產地貴一元至十餘元之代價，歸納于紗少成本內，而不得不高其價。祚紗價低落，達于成本以下時，即爲紗廠蒙受之虧折。故適應各地棉產數量，將集中都會機錠，分散內地，更依其組要，添設新廠，分佈若網，尤屬重要。茲先將全國產棉量，表示于后，進而言棉業網之設計。</p>

<p>（甲）遷部會集中紡錠于產棉區；</p>
<p>（一）都會集中紡錠，遷于產棉之內地，每地錠數以二三萬枚爲合度。其地點由專家斟酌產棉銷紗情形；善爲選擇。建築設備，在合理化原則下，力求質樸。自成棉業碉堡，不使外貨　入；各鄉會應遷錠數，與遷往地點，略擬如下：</p>
<p>（一）上海遷移六十萬錠于河南之彰德，洛陽，陝州，許昌。山東之　縣，張店，臨清，高唐，濟寗。陕西之渭南，西安，咸陽。及江蘇之徐州。安徽之蚌埠。湖南之唱的等處。</p>

<p>（二）各廠附設準備漿紗廠，推廣手工織布。遷設內地少紡織，可逕廢七搖紗成包工程，以搖紗成句機之代價購置準備漿紗機，以細紗　經加漿，製成經軸，供給農村製織原料、在嚮不織布，或用舊式狹幅織機區域，設法使之購備。或改備新式鐵木機，推廣手工織布；機構與力織機同，僅運轉之力，一爲足力，一爲動力，自能成織機可成之布。若是，紗廠之紗，不虞滯銷，而整經漿紗所費，亦較搖紗成包工資爲廉，大可低減整個生產費用，農村則因紗廠之助，得增生產，裨益經濟。</p>

<p>按需要之棉量增加棉植，設計大要，詳見拙著推進棉業三三計劃書。惟在棉業消沉時期，都會紡織工廠，紕持現狀，已大感不易，安有餘力，將其過剩紡錠，移遷內地，則必賴政府本維護民族工業之願，指令國家銀行，予以資助。其數，動力不計，每萬錠建築及移裝費，計約九萬元，即以所成建築物爲還欵保證。至準備漿紗廠及整理漂染廠設立，亦必由政府之力助成之。此則不僅紗廠蒙受其利，而于與復農村，所得尤多。若添設新廠，增加棉植，更必以國家資力，　商爲之。能如是，都會紡織工廠衰落，原于受在華外廠頃軋者，則因外商不能在非通商口岸設廠而避免。原于外貨傾銷，及農村購買力弱，擇價廉之貨購買者，吾可因原料價廉，工價低賤，而自廉日價，與之競爭，以應其需，原于資金薄弱，與人才不充者，亦不難因地價低廉，固定資金得减，貨不存積，營運資本可少，輕其利息負担，與勞工訓練後，可常爲己用，熟習所爲，彌其缺憾。下走于此舉，信爲解除現時都俞紡廠困難，及謀發展全國棉業之有效方法。爰述　得之愚，以供國民經濟建設運動項目中，　　　　。</p>
<h3>「四底」商業動態與展望</h3>
<p>— 魏有棐</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>上年結束則極度的恐慌，這餘波一直延長到今年的「四底」還存在着。這緣故，因爲去年結束期内，除了破產的破產，倒閉的倒閉而外，尚有些微能力的，爲延長他們應該支付的債務，展期三個月，到了今年四月底。此种舉動，並不能說是一種苟延殘喘的行爲，而當時實是希冀較良好的機會到臨，可是　結束後的三個月，我們觀察商業的形態，並沒有較前生動的地方，因此，在二個月以前，就有人關念於這「四底」的難關。</p>
<p>事實昭示我們，四月底形勢的嚴重，錢莊的倒閉，商店的清理，仍是上其結束期同樣的恐慌。我們既承認四月底恐慌的淵源，出於上年結束期的　　，因此我們首先回溯到去年恐慌的成因。</p>
<p>去年恐慌最大的成因是什麽？最先顯著呆滯的，我們不能不推着地產。地產商方面估計上海的地產要值到二十萬萬，而在去年的結束期中則都呆滯了。這二十八萬萬的地產，所以形成其特殊優越地位者，則是洋商之賣買與操縱。洋商存在中國的資金，在銀價未曾高漲以前，因為滙兑上的不便宜，都從事於地産的購置。這種巨大交易的成交，再接再厲的行為，遂促成地産價格扶摇直上的趨向，促成地産事業為獲利溥厚的投資。地産既為一般人認為較優越的投資以後，那時，各種的商業都顯示江河日下的傾向，金融業者以重利收得之存欵與資本，不運用之於扶植各種企業的進展，而獨爲其一時之利潤獲得計，乃　體大量投資於地產的買賣，將許多流動的資金，換成了一紙道契。一直等到銀價高翔以後，洋商鑒於匯兌上有利可圖，就把那些地產廉價　舊，現銀運回本國。中國的地產購置者，在那時不覺時態的安危，　貪圖廉價爭售那些地產。地產在那時確還行一種廻光返照的傾向。這種地產易主以後，洋商對於地產的購置慾望减退以後，這交易就一落千丈，地產的主有人　然有意以最低的代價讓渡給買主，可是銀成的減削，使那些地產去路日少，地產就呆滯起來。金融業者以重利收得之資本以及存欵來購置大宗的地產，在地產事業衰落以後，怎麼不願着恐慌呢？最近上海有兩家錢莊的倒閉，據報紙傅述，不出於第一因。</p>
<p>地產事業的沒落，是使上海的經濟社會上减少了幾十萬萬的信用籌碼。商人對於放欵的運用感到十分拮据，什麽都不能任意施展。說到放欵，就是人聯想到錢莊。錢莊是致力於信用的放欵的，我們佔計上海的錢莊五十五家，假如每家有三十萬信用放欵，總數就在一千幾百萬以上，因爲地產事業沒落之結果，一切的金融業爲要得運用資金計，就不能不把到期的放欵的量收回，以維持自己的地位。而國內絲茶漁業等等，在沒有商品之前，其勢須先有信用放欵之接濟，現在信用放欵的數量驟然減少，那末商業上就沒有活動的憑藉，那裏說得到復興。再則在不景氣籠罩下的現在，商品都顯着沒有出路，商業上如果有新的計劃，勢非重備資本不可。如此，資金的用途加大，而來路日少，捉襟見肘之原由，就在於此了。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>在上年結束期，就感到上述的苦痛，其因流轉不得其法者，不得不出破產之一途。其次刚把應該支付的債務，遷延到四月底支付。而今四月底是一個怎樣的局面呢？什麽都是在連續着，緊縮信用的結果，就迫使商業界有日暮途窮之虞，應運而生的，是工商業五百萬的小額工商信用借欵。自然這個數目與需要的數目相去甚遠，可是人心方面一定可以和緩到許多。其中商業社會，有須急迫應付債務，而力量實在不不足者，在這個僵局中，除了再展緩三個月以外，是沒有辦法的。因此我們觀察「四底」的商業動態，雖不是深刻化，而是暫維現狀。</p>
<p>爲什麽肯定地斷定商業動態是暫維現狀呢？因爲產業界三月來並無進展，這裏只舉了上海本年一月到三月來的海關冊貿易報告：</p>
<p>年份　二十四年一月—三月　二十三年一月—三月</p>
<p>進口　一五〇、一四四、七六九　一七七、四九一、三四三</p>
<p>出口　六四、三六一、一〇八　六一、九四〇、三七五</p>
<p>總額　一二四、五〇五、八七七　二三九、四三一、七一八</p>
<p>入超　八五、七八三、六六一　一一五、五五〇、九六八</p>
<p>觸目可以稍慰的，似乎是入超額的減少，而實是民窮財盡的表現。從上表看來，今年一三期的貿易，進口要减少百分之十五，出口增加百分之四弱。出口增加數量極少，不具論，入超所以减削者，由於進口貨的减少，這足以顯示我國購買力的衰落。因爲在這銀價高漲的時候，洋貨價格便宜，宣乎有一種加多的刺激，而事實和理想却巧相反者，一方因足見提高銀價影響我國購買力者有限，他方也足爲國民購買力前途之殷憂了。</p>
<p>上海是國際化的商埠，中國的全國是國際資本主義者的殖民地，國際貿易的眞微，不用說足見國內產業界狀况之一般了。</p>
<p>信用緊縮以後，上海方面代替而生的是什麼呢。現銀的出口，有許多人在統計着，這裏不抄了。但是銀貨的出口，籌碼的减少，我們似乎覺得各行發行的兌換券，　乎有加多的傾向，可是事實是這樣的。</p>
<p>最近上海各銀行兌换券發行額之統計（單位千元）</p>
<p>去年三月末　華鈔　三六〇、九〇二　洋鈔　三、〇九八　共三六四、〇〇〇</p>
<p>本年二月末　華鈔　三九四、四二九　洋鈔　三、五七一　共三九八、〇〇〇</p>
<p>上年三月末　華鈔　三一一、一五四　洋鈔　二、八四六　共三一四、〇〇〇</p>
<p>照上面看來，上海各銀行的兌換券發行額其所增加之數量，爲數極少。根據上述之論斷，則通貨的缺乏，與去年結束期的情形，並沒有兩途。雖然地產商爲打破信用緊縮的沉悶，並爲地產覔生路計，一度曾有發行地產流通券的計識，可是沒有成功。所以地產之呆滯如故。現底之缺乏如故，產業之不進展如故，「四底」之商業動態，不過暫維現狀而已！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>這個苦悶現象的打破，是任何人期望着的事。我們試就第一節裏所舉最重要的原由來說起，我們覺得國內產業的合理化，誠是顚撲不破之原理。社會購買力之衰落，由於生產不合理，因而造成貧之。現底的缺乏，其根本原由也在於入超。大家都以爲現底缺乏由於現銀出口，現銀出口由於美國購銀。其實如果中國不是入超的國家，那運送現銀出口的權力，何至在洋商手裏。爲因洋商在上海資本界的權威，完全以本國的利害爲利害，所以忽略中國的利害。地產事業之　漲暴落就是一例，所以要移轉洋商在金融界的權威到中國來，除了復興自己的產業界外是沒有辦法的。</p>
<p>金融界應該注意本身與產業界共存共榮的原理，萬不能以小我的利害關係爲營業的出發點，造成過去的錯誤。在幾年以前，金融業從事於公債與地產的投資，早有人大聲疾呼，以爲是自掘墳墓的舉動，這話是不幸而中了。所以我們爲金融業的前途計，除了扶植產業發達外，是沒有出路的。</p>
<p>「四底」是徼倖地過去了，未來的憧憬，正是我們商業社會中人所應共同注意的一件事。如果以爲「四底」過去而逍遙，則我們前途的展望是黑暗的。</p>

<h3>醫藥衛生之國是</h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>十月一日本報時評。談推廣衛生敎育之先决問題。共三段。先從國勢與民俗習尙立言。謂衛生敎育之亟不容緩。再論衛生敎育推行之難。端賴科學醫之指導與合作　末述科學醫之不能深入於社會。幷及其補苴之道。綜核以觀。蓋已認定科學醫足以救國。非沁透於全民不可也。旨哉斯言</p>
<p>夫從衛生敎育為立言之起點。則必先求如何使科學醫普逮於社會。余之所着眼者。乃更進一步。卽所謂全民之醫藥衛生。使現代之國家究竟在法律上政治上之大方針。應作如何解决。以及是否有解决之必要。再循環言之。恐亦非有醫藥衛生問題之明快解决。則最近將來。决不能逮到科學醫普逮於社會之目的者也</p>
<p>余縱觀現代之獨立國家。其在醫藥衛生之方針。决不模稜兩可。卽將東亞言之。日本土耳其暹羅。早巳明快解决。至若僅以宣傳政策為能事者。其惟歐入之治殖民地乎。殖民地政策。大權旣在其握。對諸民生習慣。力避强制之紛擾。是以新舊醫可以並行而不悖。吾人不必遠窺印度菲列賓。而近觀租界之現况亦可矣。彼方美其名曰漸移默化。夫漸移默化者。固非毫無效力。然以堂堂中華民國。廟堂之策。游移不决。吾恥之。吾深憂之。</p>
<p>今夫醫藥衛生之國是也者維何。曰國家應認定科學醫為醫師。而有逐步改革舊醫之計劃是也。苟能若此則立法上復有一貫之精神。行政上須有一定之步驟。單從立法而言之。應先有確認醫師資格之醫師法。以正視聽。而對於現代國情之調劑。可變通其試行法。及輔佐以管理舊醫之暫行條例而已。再從行政言之。應有速製醫師之敎育方針。不能徒唱高調。執歐美之成見。以膠柱鼓瑟。而云醫師非提高程度不可也。</p>
<p>故吾敢吿施政者曰。苟以全民總投稟之方式。圖解决醫藥衛生之國是也者。則百年後存此一說。千年後亦必存此一說。欲達現代國家之程序者。最近將來。必不可能。吾為此說　蓋有本也。不觀夫二千年前。以巫為正式醫師時代乎。而在今日萬國往來之滬濱。則且祝由洽病。祈　遠疾盛行於愚夫婦間。素問靈樞之說病。千金本草之說藥。為効幾何。以云普逮。則猶未耳。革心之難。有如此也。是故重大之國是。有决於廟堂二三人之間者。不能决於道旁千百人之間。歷史告我以如此。何可强耶。孔子曰。上行下效。管子曰。政先於敎（昔者日本維新之際。大久保坂垣諸傑。與長與專齋氏作一夕談。而改革漢醫之議已定。犬久保氏之言曰「事關於科學者。一切以科學為依歸。」有識如此。宜其當國而國興也。故余以為欲全民之覺悟者。必先有為政者覺悟在先。廟堂之策不决。民衆之陋習。决不能除。可以斷言。</p>
<h3>各國學校口腔衛生過去史略（四）</h3>
<p>— 司徒學</p>
<p>德國之學校口腔衛生</p>
<p>自英國Fisher氏提倡學童之齒牙須强制檢查及治療以來，不出三年，而德國Sfrasboury市之Ernst　Jessen氏亦發起學校齒科治療所，並極力宣傳關於兒童齒牙保健上之重要事項，時為一八八八年也。此乃德國學校齒科治療所之始祖。但當時此種運動，未能引起若何影饗，故一時未能得收良效。幸Jessen氏本其不屈不撓之精神，一面開設學校齒科診療，一面盡力向民衆指導，並屢發表檢查學童口腔之成績，謂學童之齒牙　蝕，已蔓延至九十五以上，若能預防撲滅之,則對於將來兒童之身體發育上，必有極明顯之關係，於是其熱心之主張，漸為其他學者所公認，不出數年，而口腔檢查成績，各地亦皆有發表矣。至一八九四年德國口腔衛生界之偉人Paul　Ritter氏，於柏林內科學會，將國民衛生上齒牙及口腔衛生之重要等事項說明，於是從來醫學界所未顧及之本問題，羣起注意焉。</p>
<p>自Jessen氏創設學校齒科治療所，約經十年，而其他都市，亦多相繼實行。Kohler亦極力提倡學校齒科治療所之必要，遂得市當局之贊成，於一九零二年八月七日，由市預算通過，提出設備費一千二百五十馬克，每年經費一千二百馬克，創辦市立學校齒科治療所。</p>
<p>學校齒科治療所之設立，雖漸有可觀，但因各都市經濟支絀，遂致不能實施。至一九零九年，德國國內所有之學校齒科治療所，僅有三十所而已。</p>
<p>一九零九年春，機會復來，創立德國學校衛生中央委員會，Das　Deutsche　Zentralkomit　Fur　Zahnpflege　in　den　Schulen成為口腔衛生運動之中心，齒科醫與民衆共同協力，宣傳口腔衛生之重要，並於各地設立學校齒科治療所。其時W,Friedmann氏於經濟上設想，發起所謂豫約式之創業，Abonnementssyatem若依此式進行，則創立市立學校齒科治療所，較為容易，故德國學校齒科衛生中央委員會，視此式為極適應時勢之需要，乃努力宣傳，果奏良效，一九零九年春，僅有三十所設立，及至一九一三年，忽增至二百餘所云。</p>
<p>自豫約式發表以後，同年Mannheim市又有所謂自由選擇制Freizeahnarzwahlu創案，其後又有Rantrcwcs氏提倡之系統的救治制等，故現今德國所施行之學校齒科衛生制度，約可分為四種，其內容如下。</p>
<p>（一）Strasboury式，或Jassen式，此為Jassen氏自一九零二年以來，與市當局共同協定所施行之方法也。以全市兒童免費治療為原則，先檢查兒童之齒牙，將診視之結果，塡入豫約片之上，寄送兒童之家長，並勸其須來學校齒科診療所，來所之兒童，一槪勵行口腔淸掃不論小學或幼稚國兒童，均應受療，據Jassen氏報吿十年間經過之成績，受治療之兒童，為六三四八九人，充塡齒數為六五四六二枚，拔　為六七三七個，小學兒童每年口腔淸掃者十二％云</p>
<p>（二）豫約式　本法為每一兒童一年中豫繳或按月繳納一　克之豫約治療費於市立學校齒科診療所。若同一家族有二人以上者，每人繳納半　。於是關於兒童一切齒科治療，均由市院辦理。一九一零年德維斯堡市市立學校齒科治療所開始，依此方法實行Friedmann氏自任所長，監督辦理一切事項，努力宣傳，並由新聞或演講中，發表關於兒童口腔於檢查所得之實際成績，及　齒蔓延可憂之現狀。結果該市之學童三三零零零人之中，有一九四零零人，卽五九％之豫約者，平均每人所納之豫約費為一零八馬克，由一九四〇〇人所納於該市之豫約費，共計一五五二〇馬克，市當局每年祗需補助五〇〇〇馬克左右，故市立學校齒科治療所容易維持，而頗得學校衛生中央委員會之贊成也。</p>
<p>（三）自由選擇制　此為Mannheim市與市內齒科醫師會共訂協約，以所謂自由選擇為原則。為學童齒牙保健上實行計，每年决定由市當局支出診查費三〇〇馬克，治療費二五〇〇〇馬克。其診查手續，乃依各學校學級順號施行，於一定之期限內，須全部檢查完畢。兒童之齒牙狀態，自經診查後，卽指示何者應治癆，或須加以適當之處置。乃由兒童或其家長自由選擇齒科醫診治，治療費依診療據，每半年向齒科醫委員處計算收納。此方法雖可實行，但一九一三年治療費總額二九一一三馬克，竟至超出預算，及至一九一四年支出額改正，增加至三〇〇〇〇馬克云。</p>
<p>（四）系統的救治制　此為Alfed　Kantrwicz氏所主張之理想的學校齒科衛生法。本法先將學童之口腔狀態檢查後，卽勸告其家族應使兒童受齒科治療，凡受療之兒童，由一年級至七年級，均得受免費治療，將治療之見童，分成八組或十組，從每學級之一號起順序行之，以完成其治療。此制度卽將全市之學童，由市費作有系統的治療也。</p>
<p>德國學校齒科，設施之運用法，雖有前述四種，但亦依各地之狀况如何，而採取適當之制度，並參加指導者之意見而施行者。歐洲大戰之前，一九一五年，全德學校齒科治療所，已達二二九所。戰時亦僅有十分之一暫時停止，而不久又恢復原狀。戰後德國之領土雖縮小，而尙有一五六所存在，且均甚動活，與戰前無異。該國對於學童口腔衛生之注意，可想而知矣。</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（四十六）腺樣增殖症</p>
<p>我在上一期（四十五）講鼻閉塞的時候。曾經購過在少年期中。常常易由患閉塞最易引起身體發育上的障　。換一句話說。就是腺樣增殖症對於身體各部的發育。實在直接具有密切的關係。所以我現在特別專題將她一切的病情。略為一叙。</p>
<p>腺樣增殖症，又名咽頭扁桃腺肥大症。因為本症就是由咽頭扁桃腺發生肥大增殖而起的緣故。她所發生的部位。是在鼻腔後壁的上部。往往由後上方閉塞後鼻　。為凹凸不平有赤色光澤的腫瘍物。本病好發於五歲至十五歲的兒童。發於成年期以後的狠少。因為　頭扁桃腺到了成年期。自已可以由生理的退行變性而萎縮。又若反復的急性炎症，腺病，及結核等亦常作本症發生的誘因</p>
<p>本症最顯著的主要病象。可別為四。</p>
<p>（一）由鼻閉塞而來的口腔呼吸—本病病人的後鼻孔。多被肥大增殖的咽頭扁腺樣增殖症而來的一種鼻閉塞。這種鼻桃腺所閉鎖或狹窄。以致鼻腔發生閉塞。鼻呼吸旣被閉塞。當然不得不營口腔呼吸。以補呼吸的不足。口腔呼吸持續旣久。患者的容貌。卽來變形。變為一種愚笨的容貌。是卽所謂腺樣增殖症容貌。就是口常半開。鼻唇溝消失。口角流涎。鼻汁亦常流出。鼻入口部，容易發赤。或患濕疹。口蓋高舉。齒牙的排列。亦多不整。胸廓的發育。亦常不全。所以患者的外觀。狠像呆大。由口腔呼吸的結果。屢可發生氣道粘膜的炎症。睡眠的時候。常發　聲。不易熟睡。有時並可發生頭眩。頭重，頭痛等等反射性的神經症狀。本症患者，若係乳兒。則因鼻腔呼吸不能的結果。常來攝取食物的障碍。而陷入營養不良的狀態。小兒發生夜尿症及夜驚症。亦多由本症的原因而起。</p>
<p>（二）聲音的變換—發音多不正。常為壅塞的鼻聲。所以在言語或讀書的時候。往往感覺困難。</p>
<p>（三）歐氏管的換氣不完全—歐氏管的換氣。若不完全則易引起中耳炎及難聽</p>
<p>（四）智育的發育不完全—因為本症大都發生鼻性注意不能症。這個症候對於智育的。狠易障碍。以致患者多半愚鈍。在學校的成績。亦未必優良。所以歐美各國的敎育當局。對於這個病症。非常注意。校中的見童。常有受醫師檢查的規定。因為本症對於身體的發育及敎育的發達與否。實有密切的關係啊。</p>
<p>本症的預後。是絕對佳良的。祇須專科醫師誠細診察决定後。施行手術。卽可排除一切障碍。恢復健康。這種手術，是毫無危險的。</p>
<p>我現在特請漫畫家徐月玲先生代我畫了兩個圖。一個是健康無病的容貌。一個是患有腺樣增殖症的容貌。我所講的病象。都已形容出來。讀者諸公當更可明瞭啊。</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學（十三）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>風濕痛是一種平常的毛病，現在先談談預防的方法。治療方法縱是奇異但也不如預防。預防這種毛病發生或重發第一急務是不使身體受冷受濕，故衣宜時時穿暖。其次飲食起居講研普通衛生以增加身體抵抗力。從夏日起每日能以冷水擦身一次使皮　健壯也是預防風濕的一法。氣候合宜時常在新鮮空氣處散步或作合宜運動亦有益不少。鼻喉口腔部有慢性發炎症的務早日醫好。</p>
<p>治療風濕痛第一要緊的是臥床靜養。如此行，一可以减少疼痛，二可以使心臟炎漸愈。至於冶療風　痛的藥物當首推柳酸鈉。此藥宜與鹼性藥品如重炭酸鉀同服。局部治療疼痛的骨節，第一使骨節完全適宜休息，如在骨節彎處放一軟枕頭輕輕托住疼痛的骨節。</p>
<p>疼痛輕的用棉花包紮起來加以休息數日之後便可全愈，痛重的以硫酸鎂水浸藥棉包紮亦可。其他藥糊隨醫指導可也。熱濕　敷也有相當的價値。病者務勿嘗試鴉片嗎啡以麻醉神經止痛，因梢一不愼便入羅網。（未完）</p>
<h3>螳螂子</h3>
<p>— 張致果</p>
<p>螳螂子俗名也。卽乳嬰之口腔內有白色隆起之物。多位於左右頰近齒齦之處。或在牙肉上。新醫籍中未嘗見此種病狀之紀述。故無以名之。余昔不解其為何患。數年前有友某君之孩息此。由一村媼持銀針剔出白色如豆　之物約一茶匙許。友持至余處。囑為檢查。余禘視之。知為脂肪組織。置於醚內。可溶解而收縮。用顯微鏡檢視之。吳盡為脂肪組織細胞。且並無白血球等雜其間。可知非因發炎而生。余隨即給友防腐劑。囑塗創處。後無變故。然因割　　子而釀成口腔壁炎或化膿者。余常遇之。</p>
<p>余思螳鄉子卽口腔粘膜層下之脂肪組織增生而成。所以增生者。大槪因乳嬰吸乳時口腔內發生眞空所致。蓋眞空作用足以引起組織增生。而脂肪組成又為最易增生者。在病理學上本有因眞空作用而組織增生之理。卽所謂Hypeptrphie　ex　vacuo也。</p>
<p>乳嬰之患螳螂子者。雖無其他不良病象。但常多啼哭。而不肯吃乳。大槪兩頰上有隆起之螳鄉子。足以阻礙其吸乳之動作。因飢而哭。似頗近理。故摘去之後。啼哭卽止。</p>
<p>世俗間視割取螳螂子無甚危險。大槪事實上釀成發炎化膿者確占少數。最多流血而已。此或因口腔有自潔之作用使然。</p>
<p>最奇者。新醫籍內無此種病狀之紀述。（余於病理學內未見之）豈歐洲小孩無此患　。余思歐美小孩多用乳瓶吸乳。吸乳之動作較輕易。我國小孩之患此病者。或因母之洩乳困難。或乳汁不多。小孩須用力吮吸所致。然聞人言。此病僅江浙人知之。別省人多不知者。是更可異已。又剔取螳　子之法。用一平直之銀針。先挑破粘膜表面少許。然後自其下　出自色之物。（狀如芝麻大之細粒併集而成大槪如螳　之卵故有其名）多由村嫗或收生婆為之。技之佳者。可不甚出血。且歷時甚短。亦可稱為專技也。</p>
<p>戚友之小孩有患此者。余常囑聽其自然。不久亦能自消退。故小孩之患此者。可不必割治。以免發炎化膿之危險。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十七）骨軟化症</p>
<p>（Osteomalacia）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做骨軟化症？</p>
<p>（答）這是因為骨質的石灰分消失和萎縮，以致骨質異常桑軟的病變。</p>
<p>（問）發生骨軟化症的原因是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）也和伺僂病一樣，原因於營養障礙，尤其是丁種維他命的缺乏而起。所以也可以稱他為成人的佝僂病。</p>
<p>（問）發生這種病的年齡，大槪在什麽時候？</p>
<p>（答）大多數在三十歲到五十歲的時候發生；但也有在少年和年發生的。</p>
<p>（問）男女性別，有沒有關係？</p>
<p>（答）以婦女為多：尤共是在妊娠婦和產褥期中最易發生。</p>
<p>（問）和季節有沒有關係？</p>
<p>（答）冬季和早春為多，夏季較少。</p>
<p>（問）發生骨軟化症和地理的分佈，有無關係？</p>
<p>（答）有許多地方，確有關係，在華北，印度，歐洲，日本內地，比較的多些。</p>
<p>（問）發生這種病後，起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）有疼痛，運動障礙，骨形變化，和肌肉衰弱等病狀。</p>
<p>（問）疼痛的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）疼痛，是最初的病狀。在骨盆骨，腰部，背部，四肢，尤如大腿等部。又該部有壓痛。</p>
<p>（問）　動障礙的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）運動障礙，就因為疼痛或骨形的變化而起。尤於骨盆骨　骨為著明。步行的時候，不能平穩並目非常緩慢，或是蹣跚跳躍等狀態。</p>
<p>（問）骨形變化的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在骨盆胸廓脊柱等骨，都起形態的變化。</p>
<p>（問）骨盆的變形，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）在薦骨甲，因為軀幹的重量的壓力而變隆起；骨盆的側部，也因為股骨頭的壓迫而內陷。於是骨盆入口縮小是心臟形。</p>
<p>（問）胸廓的變形，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）肋骨向側方下降：胸骨　非常隆起，於是胸廓的形狀，變成不正的奇形。</p>
<p>（問）脊柱的變形，是怎極的？</p>
<p>（答）脊柱上半部，是後屈或後屈兼側彎。同時頭部前屈，因而病人的身高因而短縮。</p>
<p>（問）肢骨和面部，頭蓋等處的骨質，有沒有變化？</p>
<p>（答）　許多部分的骨質，並沒有什麽變化。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（五〇）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十一章　肺結核的合併症</p>
<p>第一節　結核性腦膜炎</p>
<p>本症患者以小兒為最多，大人則較鮮，尤以一歲至五歲間小孩頂多。他的臨床上症象，尋常可分為前驅，刺激，和麻痺三時期。在前驅時期中，大半是沒有什麼顯着症象，狠不容易診斷的。尋常狠活潑的小孩，在此時會變成性情乖僻；無遊戲興趣，不思食，多睡。大人則除頭痛外，也是沒有什麽覺着的。這一種狀態，有時可持績至數日以久的。但是到了刺激症象一發生，他的狀態完全會變成兩樣的。此時頭部劇痛，精神過敏，對光線及音饗，均現不安的狀熊；惡心，門齡，軋牙，項部也漸强直，皮膚知覺過敏，雖輕度之觸着亦覺疼痛非常；局部或全身現肌肉緊張，强直，及痙　狀態，甚至癲癎樣發作。腹部陷沒；脈膊頻數，但如腦壓愈高，則為數愈緩慢，溫度上昇並不甚高，近四十度者殊不多見，呼吸疾速，患者自是戚覺消失，人事不省，呈昏迷狀；顏面及眼肌神經均麻痺，最後則陷於不治。本症的經過時間，從前驅　到死亡，通常大槪四星期光景；但如果腦壓現象發生快速，則為期較短。關於本症的診斷，在前驅期間是非常困難的；但假使臨床上種種症象已狠顯著發生了，那是大致可加以揣測的。對於病者原來結核症之有無，也是一件狠値得注意的事情，其間結核菌素反應之為正號或負號，對於本症的診斷，是狠有助力的。至其中最有價値的證明，自莫過於腰脊椎穿刺一手術了！他的脊椎液是透明，問稍帶渾濁，但决不帶化膿性；壓力高，蛋白量增加自血球淋巴球均增加；液中可證明結核　的，這是本症唯一的證據　血液圖像的檢查，在此處是沒有多大價値的。本症預後的情形，是非常惡劣，轉愈的例證，幾乎是絕無僅有的。治療除尋常的對症療法外，腰脊椎穿刺二　術，對於高度腦壓，似不無助力；但對於全部的病症，是談不到什麽効果的。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>詹姆斯喬易斯</h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>詹姆斯·喬易斯（James　Joyce）是愛爾蘭都伯林小市民生活的描寫者。他的代表作品「優力西斯（Ulysses）的出現，是現代文學史上個奇異的現象；牠確定了喬易斯在文學中的最高的地位。喬易斯的模倣者遍了全世界，對於喬易斯的註釋和崇拜緊張了市民文學的整個的神經，而喬易斯式（Joycean）這個名詞成了最流行文學用語。</p>
<p>喬易斯於一八八一年生於愛爾蘭。出身於一個有着充分敎育的家庭。曾就學於一個耶穌會的神學校和都伯林大學。因爲不能忍耐愛爾蘭市民的腐敗的鄉國，他逃到了大陸。作爲一個窮困的英語敎員，他漫遊了全歐。他後來的市民心理的描寫和文字的新造，在這漫遊的期間，都植了深的根柢。</p>
<p>最重要的，就是在這個時期，他深入了西歐文化的大流中，感受了世界市民的最典型最中心的藝術家的影響，一方面受了亨利·詹　斯（Heocy　James）和馬色爾·普洛斯托（MarcelProust）的極端的心理主義的薰陶，另一方面受了特別表現在巴黎繪畫中的構造派立體派的感染，這都是構成他後來的特別風格的最重要的因紫。可是他的故國的「愛爾蘭文藝復興」派，也强烈地影響了他。他的最初的詩集「室內音樂（Chamber　Music）除了稍爲緊嚴，稍爲剛硬一點以外，差不多完全是模倣「文藝復興」派的偉大詩人夏芝（Ycats）和他的集團的。</p>
<p>到第一部作品「都伯林的人們」（Doibliners）發表時，喬易斯才大體脫離了「文藝復興」的詩人們的浪漫的傳統，傾向於世界的寫實主義者，模倣佛羅貝爾，莫泊桑和喬治摩爾。</p>
<p>在技巧上，喬易斯雖然成了世界主義者，可是他描寫的對象，成功的基礎差不多完全是都伯林的小市民的生活和心理，「都伯林的人們」完全是都伯林的人們的灰色的狹隘的物質生活的速寫，和幽悽的靈魂的捕捉。喬易斯的生物學的失敗主義的思想的本質，在這最初的散文裏，可以看出一個輪廓。</p>
<p>「一個靑年藝術家的　像」（A　Portuait　ofthe　Artisl　an　Young　Mfan)是作者的自傅。主人公德大拉斯（Dedalus）就是作者自己，這書是對於他的愛爾蘭的敎養的淸算，可是牠比「都伯林的人們」　着更多的愛爾蘭色彩，而且也更年靑，浪漫一點。這書的創作方法還是有些朴素，沒有獨創的地方。他的　創的風格，直到優力西斯」出版的時候，才完全確立。</p>
<p>大家知道，一優力西斯」是一部怪書，牠用七三二頁的大的篇幅，僅僅記錄都伯林三個人二十四小時間的生活。牠是有名的　褻的小說，也是有名難讀的書，在英國最初是禁止出版的。牠完成於一九二一年，出版於一九二二年，最初賞識這書，簪這書鼓吹介紹的人，是一位最有錢的美學者，其他的人，對於這書很少感到與趣，在一種無盡的語言的森林裏，披荊斬棘，祗能發見一些無價値的瑣事和偶然的形象，不是　肪過剩的人，誰也不需要牠罷？</p>
<p>「優力西斯」是喬易斯創造活動的頂點，也是牠的終結。「優力西斯」以後十餘年間，他再沒有寫一點値得注意的東西。</p>
<p>在　　喬易期作品裏，充斥了俗物。「都伯林的人們」裏的人們都是一些沒有熱情，滿腹利害打算的男女。在「優力西斯」裏，布倫姆（Blum）是俗物，他的妻馬利盎（Marion）也是祇有肉體的慾望的俗物。她想着藝術家德大拉斯，可是她所需要的並不是他的腦髓，是他的白潔的肉。統戰部現於「一個靑年藝術家的畫像」，同時又出現於「優力西斯」的德大拉斯，是作者的自畫像，也不過是一個庸俗的現代哈孟雷特·猥瑣，怯懦，淫蕩，猶疑是喬易斯的人物的特質。因此，拉提克說：「喬易斯是把那用照相機，通過顯微鏡去照取糞塊的事，作爲藝術家的任務。對於他人類是　　中的不潔的蚯蚓。」</p>
<p>爲什麼喬易斯所看到的人間是這樣地醜陋和惡心呢？第一，是他的社會的存在決定了他祗能看到這些。通過灰色的玻璃能看見灰色的對象，同樣，通過頹廢的沒落心理，祇能看見否定的人類。其次，他的那種愛無差等的速記式的寫實和毫無選擇的心理描寫，更帮助他歪曲了現實，他看到了許多沒有相互關係的表面的偶然的形象，却抓不住人間的本質，看不出人民大衆的最根本的契機，不理解發展的基本綫索，更不知道世界的動向，這樣在他的作品中當然只有毫無價値的人物和雜沓的心理。</p>
<p>世界是那麽遼闊，而他的視野却這樣狹小，因此，爲了消磨他的　暇，他不得不去摸索意識和潛　識的每一個黑暗的角落，去撫弄他的「內在的經騐」的一切微小部分。而且，爲了裝璜他的空虛的內容，他又努力於新字的創製（Word　Coinage）他最愛用許多不能排印的字。常常把許多字連在一道。在「優力西斯」裏，整整四十五頁沒有一個標點符號。形式的奇異，達於極點。</p>
<p>喬易斯的這種寄特的形式和他的空虛的內容緊緊聯擊着，對於文學，是無緣的。同樣，他的顯微鏡的方法，他的「濟意識的實現」和「內在的獨白」的方法，甚至於他的描寫外界的自然主義的手法，對於文學　　有裨益，因爲這都　着靜學的，矯揉造作的性質，是與文學，應當有新鮮的內容和崇高的目的相違反的。</p>
<h3>早晨</h3>
<p>— 劉白羽</p>
<p>濛濛朧朧的早　裏，大道上白茫茫的什麽也看不淸楚了，只一行柳樹在半空劃了幾條灰影。</p>
<p>鷄呌過兩遍——田　上，一兩個人影沒入樹底去。</p>

<p>莊西頭的張月亭，照例起來溜溜腿，可是今天，他看着一塘一塘的稻田，沒有絲毫的笑容「　中無錢—」這眞是着急的事，他正低着頭走八字步，小瓜皮帽上的紅玻璃球，在微噓的朝暾裏，一閃一閃，偏巧大車一搖一擺走來。驚破他的沉思，使他橫起眼來帶了討厭的眼光掃了一眼。</p>
<p>車轅上的人，攢了枯木枝向　子屁股上撾，後面……後面，一個娘兒們，俏俏的臉兒，映在毛藍布衫上，更是白晳晳的了，他下勁抹了一下眼角上的吃模糊，心裏盤算着「是……是小王莊上，老李家的車，那回墊道，想敲兩個錢花，都讓他破壞了……有哪，今天……哼」</p>
<p>徽微笑了，</p>
<p>張月亭忘了脚底下都　了綻了，跑兩步，提出那份啞吧桑子喊，</p>
<p>「那兒的車停着……停着</p>
<p>車攬着了繮繩，　子搖尾巴，吐一口氣，</p>
<p>「汽車道你們敢跑大車好大膽子……你是那兒的，走小道，你不知道嗎！「兩手抆在腰間，神氣十足，</p>
<p>「得哪，你抬抬手……我們眞有急事。」</p>
<p>「不行……不行，你要懂得，汽車道在那莊上，歸那莊保護……不行，警察公所……」</p>
<p>這們一嚷的功夫，霧也嚇得沒影了，一盤紅日從東方出來，莊上的人……過路的人，圍了個圈子，擠……擠，才從被窩爬出來的孩子，也一股兒跑來看熱鬧，大家誰也不言語，誰心裏都知道這是怎麽回事——車上的娘兒們，嚇得臉上和　一般黃，</p>
<p>半個多鐘頭後——趕車的和他耳語了幾句，他揮了揮手，向四圍作個收塲，</p>
<p>「我跟他去……我跟他去」</p>
<p>一塲風波平息了，太陽照着各塘的水皮，搖盪出好幾條銀蛇似的光亮，一行行柳樹欵擺起來，</p>
<p>吃飯時侯！張月亭從市上回來，一手提了一尾大魚，一手提了半瓶紹興酒，滿面春風的笑着。</p>
<h3>阿蘭</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>放了春假了。</p>
<p>我們的學校雖然不大，是私立的小學校呵！兩幢兩下的房子。可是平時有　把個小朋友們在　通着，好像灰白的總壁也會說話了。可是現在，現在是放了春假了，那麽冷濟淸地，猶如深山間的一座古　。那麽孤獨地，我坐在「敎務室」里，靜聒着壁上的鐘聲滴滴。寂寞的寒氣，雙上　來，全身都　慄了起來。</p>
<p>「抽枝烟吧」！</p>
<p>淡淡的烟絲·從嘴中，鼻孔中，婀　而出，像幾條小靑龍似地，游着。，可是立　就解了體，消失了！</p>
<p>只是更加覺得寂寞！</p>
<p>「是的！還是看幾頁書吧」！</p>
<p>可是剛把書翻開，門環兒却「答答答」地響起來了。似乎是心的歡喜，脚步是那麽迅速，奔了出去開門。</p>
<p>進來的是一位年輕的姑娘，面貌黑黑地，身體的發育是那麽强健，髮是「童化」式的，並沒有燙。脚上穿的是籃球鞋，……</p>
<p>我正在那麽考量，她却開口呌我了：</p>
<p>「×先生，」</p>
<p>「唔……」</p>
<p>我投了她僩疑間的眼光，那姑娘是那麽聰明，微笑地說，</p>
<p>「怕不認識我了吧？」</p>
<p>「唔，是，是，有點兒　不起來啦！」</p>
<p>我那麼囁嚅着，她仍微笑地：</p>
<p>「我是阿蘭！」</p>
<p>「哦！是阿蘭」我幾乎要在這位姑娘的面前跳起來了，我接續下去說：「啊！這麼大　嗎？啊，現在在哪兒唸書！請進來坐着談吧！……」</p>
<p>我領了她走進敎務室，她吿訴了我，她唸書的學校，態度是那麽謹愼，謙遜。</p>
<p>已是好幾年以前的事了，那時阿蘭還只八歲吧？到我校裏來唸書，我就歡喜她那黑黝黝的面孔的兩個笑渦兒。她上課是多頑皮呵！可是不知怎地，她的頑皮總不會使人討嫌的，反覺得有趣哩！</p>
<p>因爲我是戴的「羅克」眼鏡，所以她畫了個戴眼鏡的人，正在哭哩！她拉着我說：</p>
<p>「先生！這是你，你也要哭的哩！」</p>
<p>我有意罵了她幾句，她立刻　起小嘴巴來，不理我啦！不理我有二天之多哩！可是第三天的早上，她的兩手反放在背後，跳躍得像一隻小雀子那麽地，走到我的面前來：　　「先生：你猜我背後有什麼呀？」</p>
<p>她是完全忘了我會罵過她的！我搖了搖頭，見她那麽天眞，我的兩　捧　了她的肥胖的小黑臉：</p>
<p>「不曉得，大概是好東西啦」！</p>
<p>她笑着把　放到我的而前來啊哈！每隻手提五隻　子，兩個黑小渦兒深深地，說：</p>
<p>「先生：是湖州　子！給你吃的哩：」</p>
<p>想一兩件事情，眞像看一兩張複雜的畫片。現在她問我了：</p>
<p>「先生近來身體好嗎？」</p>
<p>自家年紀還輕得很，經不了那種像安慰老人家的話，我感動地說：</p>
<p>「很好！很好！」</p>
<p>我又向她仔細地看了起來，想從她的黑黝黝的臉上我尋那兩個黑烏烏的笑渦兒。——可是沒了！她在我的面前是多謹慎呵！</p>
<p>我們已有四個多年頭沒見面了，中間經過「一二八」戰爭後，就大家不知道大家住在哪兒了。她吿訴我，她遇見好些老同學，問起我的住址，學校還辦不？可是都說不知道。這次是因爲碰見了我的母親，才知道我的住址，因此趁這春假期內來看望我。</p>
<p>我們客氣地談了好一會兒，她留給了我一個通信處後，就吿辭了。我送她到了門口，她深深地向我鞠了一個躬，說：</p>
<p>「再會吧！先生！有空再來望你！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>我說不出什麽來，我的喉管間像有什麽東西塞着似地，我只是苦笑地點着頭。</p>
<p>她的後影在一個轉角處消失了，我沉重地歎出了口氣來。拴上門走進屋子，無意間自己的右手觸着了自己的下巴，刺一般的　子痛了自己的手背。</p>
<p>「啊！我……」</p>
<p>我又陷在像深山間的古剎一般的寂寞裏了！</p>
<h3>春天麼？</h3>
<p>— 歐陽凡海</p>
<p>已經是春天了麽？</p>
<p>我從何知曉！</p>
<p>凉風和往日同樣一聲聲帶來催行的進軍喇叭，</p>
<p>一個個油色黃昏和往日一樣帶給我一個個藍色的早朝，</p>
<p>我的脚，踏過這個連環，</p>
<p>就須要接步走進那個門限，</p>
<p>我從何知曉春天在什麽地方？</p>
<p>已經是春天了麽？</p>
<p>這是不是一個可驚可喜的慌話！</p>
<p>全世界的車輪一樣在我的身旁運轉，</p>
<p>一樣騷裂着我的耳鼓！</p>
<p>自嗚鐘也不肯停止它喲喲嗒嗒的聲響，</p>
<p>我的血脈和窗外那工廠的汽笛，</p>
<p>和那吐着白烟狂走的巨輪，</p>
<p>和一切無情地飛轉着的皮帶凑搏着</p>
<p>不管春夏秋冬都是一樣的節拍！</p>
<p>我跳在這些皮帶裏，</p>
<p>我跳在這些輪環間，</p>
<p>如果我看見春天，</p>
<p>那一定是眼花，把皮帶間和巨輪下姑娘們的紅頰</p>
<p>錯認作是春天的櫻花了！</p>
<p>這是不是一個可驚可喜的慌話！</p>
<p>已經是春天了麽？</p>
<p>聽那催行的進軍喇叭，</p>
<p>我們在開着步伐！</p>
<p>如果春天眞已來到，</p>
<p>難道說她不知道</p>
<p>我左手拖着自己，右手挽着人寰，</p>
<p>要走過這個山尖，不許停息，</p>
<p>再爬上那個難關；</p>
<p>幸福與快樂的天使早已諒解我的心懷：</p>
<p>我不要醉人的酒，只要助速的油，</p>
<p>如果春天眞已來到，</p>
<p>就讓她偸偸溜走！</p>
<p>——四月十二日·一九三五——</p>
<h3>三天（三）</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>「眞是阿　陀佛呢，你這個人怎麽這樣說不通？去年龍會裏借的二百塊錢，只有三天到期了，可是天這麽老是下雨，稻不能割，來不及　米，總得想個法子。龍會的錢是不能拆瀾汚的，只差時辰不差日子。要是下回借不動，我們以後的日子怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「我管不得這許多，我們做來做去，只在債堆裏翻筋斗，你急死也不會出頭的，到月底再說吧，他們拿不到錢，就怎樣？……」</p>
<p>有發聽着這個話便　了一　，他想不到老實勤儉的弟弟，會說出這樣古怪的話的。他睜着那雙血紅的眼，想說什麽話，可是沒等他開口，有才早姑起身子，走向門外去。</p>
<p>他紫不住獃了會兒，等到紙楣子越燒越短，燙到他手上，才猛的把手一縮，把水烟袋擱在門檻邊，埋怨着有才又到胡永良那邊去　。</p>
<p>這小子次回來不知又帶了些什麽鬼話來的，有才這麽痴頭獃腦的老跟他去說話，去年回來一次，把有才他們幾個小伙子都敎壞了，都變得那麽倔强，這眞不是好兆！有發在比子裏說；小伙子是　該　點兒苦的，只要能够耐　苦，總有一天身上會沒有責，會子子也過日子，鄉下人要個錢，那裏不是把力氣換來的。前村的王根福，他老子死後丟了他一身的債，他咬緊牙齒做，　忙時候自天替人家做短工，早晚做自己的，放着那些零星生活，到半夜爬起來再做，吃那麽十多年苦，一身債到底也還活了。難道像胡永良那麼說幾句大話，把富人們牙癢　地罵一頓，債就沒有了嗎？有發覺得這樣說大話是更糟糕的，他們只是想偷　罷了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>取締庸醫</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海的　色之一是醫生多。各馬路各弄堂，到處都可以看到掛着××醫院××醫師的招牌。這大約是因為上海居民衆多的原故。但上海這許許多多的醫生，其中正式的醫生雖不少，而沒有牌子的醫生也很多。這些沒有牌子的醫生，大都是實　生，藥局生，看護，助手等出身的，或者讀幾年醫學而未畢業者，還有的就是江湖醫生。他們旣沒有相當的醫學知識，治病又盡以營利為目的。病人受害，實非淺鮮。我們常見一班江湖醫生，為人治病，每自誇其醫術怎樣高明，能起死回生。實則視人命如草芥、，隨便下藥打針。病人之因而喪生的，正不知有多少。</p>
<p>近者聞蔣委員長以未經登記的中醫開業，本不合法，又不懂科學消毒法，隨意對患者打針營利，貽害病人不少。且包醫各病，亦屬於欺　性質。尤其是為人　牙者，絕對不能稱為醫師。更不許濫施手術注射，致生危險。因此特嚴行取締，日前已令行本市市長，分令衛生公安　兩局遵辦在案。茲悉衛生局已於日昨派定該局醫藥主任，會同公安局保健股主任，規定時間，率警按區查察，藉資取締云。</p>
<p>此舉，實於人民健康，有莫大的利益。行見本市市府當局，實行查察取締的結果，本地庸醫，得以日漸絕跡。至少亦得减少其數量，這未始不是一般居民之幸。</p>
<p>然要取締庸醫，實不應以中醫為限。　屬未經登記的庸醫，須一概加以取締，　　不問其為中為西也。因為取締庸醫，須徹底取締，才有效果。若僅取締共一部份，則他部份仍然存在。病人受害，還是一樣。這點我們希望當局有以注意之。</p>
<h3>喜訊</h3>
<p>— 筱雲</p>
<p>聽見弄堂裏呌賣「桔子」和「脆皮甘蔗」的聲　音，琳總是很忽忙地跑下樓來買着，像小孩子似的，連拿到房間裏去的一剎那時間的食念的性兒也忍煞不住，一面走着路，一面地剝食着。</p>
<p>「怎麽成呢！琳，你沒有吃過早飯就這樣地吃起來，可不是要把胃弄壞嗎」？我總是耽心着她的身體的健康，很誠懇又帶着一點生氣的樣子從她的手裏搶奪過這些廿蔗桔子來。然而，她老是嘻皮笑臉　伸出手兒來懇求討饒着，彷彿喉頭乾渴得像火燒，同時，又像抽士鴉片的「老槍」似的「烟癮」，只要分一點點給她　下，那她就很覺得心滿意足了。</p>
<p>有時，和她一同上街去，偶然從水菓攤前走過，她瞧見裏面陳擺着許多淡黃色的　菓，口涎就在她的口裏交流。帶着傷戚的氣分嘟噥着。</p>
<p>「仁，我們已經五六個年頭沒有吃過　菜了，五六年，自從我們離開暹羅至現在　什麽時候我們才能再回到暹羅去痛痛快快地吃呢？……當我一瞧見　菜的時候，我便聯想起在南國過的好日子來？……」</p>
<p>「那就買幾隻帶回去吧，琳　　」我安慰着她的流浪底心說。</p>
<p>可是，一問起價錢，又使琳縮回了手了。</p>
<p>「仁，怎麽這樣貴呢？這些又不是上等的　菓。」</p>
<p>自然，一個久住在　菜出產地的南國，吃慣　菓的人，是不大高興在這上海的水菓　頭，以高價錢來買那一點也沒有香味的下等　　哩。</p>
<p>最近，一個親戚從南洋回來，同時，並帶來一籃淺黃的可愛的　菓，這一來，眞使我快活極了！我心裏想：這回琳可以高興興地，痛快地吃着，這闊別多年，時時懷念的南洋的　菓啊！」</p>
<p>可是，意外地，琳還沒有吃上一隻就擯棄了，眉心緊皺着，呢喃着：</p>
<p>「怎麽這些　菜一點也沒有味道，全不像從前吃過的一樣？我眞個不想再吃了。」</p>
<p>「琳，這就是這所想念着的「象牙」，「象牙」是　菓中的一種佳種。）五六</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>年來沒有送進口裏去的「象牙」啊！你再嘗一嘗吧。」我從籃裏揀出一隻爛熟的軟嫩嫩的。</p>
<p>但，琳報答我的，却是搖蕩着她的腦袋。</p>
<p>琳近來確是有點兒變態了，彷彿給輕軟的春風吹倦似的，什麼事情都懶做了，整天的睜不開眼睛，骨子酥迷迷地躺在床上睡覺，像一個喝過量的酒，泥醉醉的人。那頭燙捲的頭髮更加蓬鬆起來，鏡子也因爲她多天沒有起來對照，而蒙上一層薄簿的灰塵了　有時就連吃飯，也會使她覺得很厭倦，不願起來了</p>
<p>當她吃過飯之後，胃裏頓時就感到不舒服，很難過地嘔吐出來，脖子滿　着繩子般大的靑筋，臉孔　得紅紅的，氣喘喘的嘔着。</p>
<p>「這都是你平時不小心亂吃東西的結果，現在可把好好的胃弄壞了！」我扶着她到睡床上去，躺着，心裏懊喪地埋怨她平日不聽我的勸告。</p>
<p>等琳喘定之後，於是，我對她提議</p>
<p>「琳，我賠你去看醫生吧。生起病來不是好玩的，尤其是胃病，更覺得纏人……我們都是異鄉的流浪者，身體的健康，才是寳貝啊！」</p>
<p>跨出醫院的門檻，我底耳朶里還很淸晰地嚮着醫生對我恭喜的兩句話：「尊夫人不是害胃病，她已經懷了孕了」</p>
<p>一想起小生命出世時的種種問題，我底腦袋昏沉沉地痛得發燒，簡直是壓上幾千斤重的鐵塊。天啊！窮光蛋的流浪者，怎麼能够養起兒子來呢？</p>
<h3>到家</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>——南歸散記——</p>
<p>走完一段河堤，穿出謝家莊的草坪，家屋背面的暗綠葉子的籠眼林已舉目在望了。像一隻失途的鳥，一朝飛返故巢，心歡快得跳了。（家鄉就是這麼親切可愛啊）</p>
<p>正是稻收的季節，然而，枯萎的稻苗，稀落的稻穗，乾裂的田畦，已不難看出故鄉人的豐收的美夢，已經給一度雨旱打得支離散碎了。稻田里正散着許多割稻的婦女，夕慕的軟陽下，褲管捲到大腿上，沉重地挑起像患了貧血症的稻籃，走向歸家的路。微風里，耳邊彷彿傳來她們一，長串的嗟息。</p>
<p>從屋側小巷跳進屋里，冷淸淸的，禾坪上起落着打稻的聲響。把行李安放後，就往門口走去。母親和嬸娘們紮着頭帕正在那里打稻，祖母蹲在一邊捆稻草，三歲的宣弟依。祖母身邊玩着一隻洋鐵罐子。我之突然的出現，眼花的祖母竟愕異一陣，接着顫巍巍的緊　着我的手，慈祥的眼淚竟歡喜得流下來了。</p>
<p>——呵呵，阿英，汝回來了，我念了汝兩長年啊，汝回來了。她隨即轉身拉了宣弟過來。</p>
<p>——阿妹，喏，阿哥回來了，呌聲阿哥，阿哥歡喜阿妹呢，乖妹子。</p>
<p>我一手抱起宣弟，在他白嫩的頰上吻了一下。只兩年時光，這天眞可愛的嬰孩，已長大起來會行走說說了。我不禁又抬頭望望祖母：白髮已加深了，嘴也癟了下去，額面的皺紋顯得更密；母親和嬸娘也是一副給苦作磨得黧黑的肌膚，而可　愛的母親可顯得更憔悴些。一種無可言　的內疚，幾乎要呌我跪到母親膝前。我是太忍心，太自私了！長年的流浪中，幾乎三個月還寄不到一封家信，使得祖母母親們在苦作的日子里，還要時時刻分出苦心來想念我，擔心我，爲我傷懷落淚。此日還是落拓歸來，她們的失望傷心，呌我那里還敢想下去！此刻母親拉住我，慈愛的眼光老釘在我的臉上身上，她說：</p>
<p>——英，汝瘦了啊，汝在外邊一定病</p>
<p>說到這里，梗住了。這眞如一支鋒利而長的針刺，深深的貫入我的胸，我的心，我的五臟六腑。是喲，兩長年流浪的生活，我時時刻刻都在病，病得凶，但是，這個病可不是普通的風寒感冒之類的肉體上的病。人情的冷暖，世態的刻薄，生活的顚沛，都不由我不在這千鈞的重壓下，抹去了兩頰以往的童稚的紅暈，敷上個風塵困頓，病態的油彩。欺詐，虛偽，狠毒，醜惡，都集成一排箭簇，四面八方的對着我射過來，我那能不受傷，那能不病哪。</p>
<p>可是，我能把這些委屈老老實實的吐訴在母親面前麼，我難道還有此忍心再在她傷惻的心上加上一錐打擊麼？</p>
<p>——不啊，媽。我一向很好。因爲天熱，暈船，三天吃不下一粒飯，所以……</p>
<p>扯了一個謊，連忙背轉身去，眼淚止不住地奪眶流下了。</p>
<h3>病榻小記</h3>
<p>— 溟濛</p>
<p>早上才覺得腦子有點虛暈，一到下午，週身便覺得非常不舒適。漸漸地，脈搏突然加增，額上摸起來旣然　起炎熱，太陽穴猛地也跳痛起來。黃昏以後，蓋在被子里的身子也覺得怕冷，偶然間皮膚會震起了鷄粟。喉嚨間一陣癢，咳嗽也臨上　了。湊合這些病微，顯然覺到這副素來雖不康强，却也頗爲平穩的有機組織，現在是發生一點小障礙了。</p>
<p>「好，會生一點小病也好。」自己向自己這麼說着，像希望病的到來一樣。</p>
<p>所以會發生這種想法的，倒也有其所以然的理由。自從應該倚靠着賣點文章來帮助生活費以來，成日的腦筋像被各種野馬所蹂躪般地錢踏。才放下一本厚書本，便會收到家庭間訴苦的信件；把信件拋開，馬上便持起筆來寫作。閒來時翻一翻各種雜誌，睡下來却遝要想想寫作的題材。朋友們都上健身房和運動塲，我却常常被各種思想和幻想所咬嚙。弄得來身心疲敝，讀書旣不成，寫作也不好。合起書本不念吧？不行！停下筆不寫吧？更不行！只好硬着頭皮，擔着這副並不强健的身軀向着時間邁進。</p>
<p>近兩三個月來，漸漸覺得這種生活是不能久持的了，因爲身心方面都似乎有了反應。頭腦時時不很淸明，而精神也似乎有點衰老。有一天，便　下筆桿說道；</p>
<p>「讓我小病兩三天，當做休息吧！」</p>
<p>想不到這句憤　的話語竟然實現了，我倒也滿心願意。晚上機關里的醫生來，說是流行性感冒，睡幾天會好的。</p>
<p>「謝天謝地，便讓我好好地睡幾天吧！——不過，這不是開玩笑的，只好睡幾天，太多可又不行了！」</p>
<p>醫生笑着走開，（好在機關里的醫生和藥都是不要錢的，否則倒不可以怎麼稱心如意。）把藥吃了。昏昏然睡了一天一晚，把全世界和身邊雜事都給忘掉，眞是覺得其樂無窮！此後兩三天，爲了藥力發作，各方面的病態都漸漸好起來了，於是便不能完全昏然睡去。但是靜靜地躺在牀上，不加思慮，倒也很覺快樂。無聊時翻一本「茶花女遺事」或「曼郎勒士戈」，倒也較平時讀英文書時遠覺有味。只是外面時時傳來噪聲，精神還覺得不能沈澱至安寗境界，頗覺遺憾！</p>
<p>漸漸地，會爬起床來煮粥吃了。飯香很覺可口；一只　蛋也似乎很覺有味。只是黃金色的太陽光刺得眼睛有點發花，風吹來時也覺得皮膚擔受不起，更壞的是一想起病愈後又要擔當生人的工作，眞是只好皺眉。</p>
<p>病算是好了，各種堆積的工作都擁擠上來，更加應接不暇。幾天的休息和安樂，似乎更加使現一在擔上重負，不禁眉頭皺得更深，而氣透得更長了。更不妙的是病後身體更覺虛弱，精神更覺衰頹。一做事，頭還要昏，咳嗽還偶然要襲上來……那只好怨說不用錢的醫生和藥的不中用了。</p>
<p>「還是不要把病來當做休息才好。」現在却是這麼想了。</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the 14th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government; Central Government and Various Localities Hold Commemorative Meetings</h3>
<p>President Wang Recounts the Circumstances of the Premier at the Time</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held a grand meeting on the morning of the 5th to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government. The Party headquarters inside and outside were decorated with flowers and slogans, presenting a completely fresh atmosphere. Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Chu Minyi, Fang Juehui, Chen Bijun, Deng Jiayan, Fu Rulin, Zhang Zhen, Li Zonghuang, Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, Hong Ludong, Ding Chao Wu, Wang Qi, Miao Peicheng, and representatives of various agencies Wang Yongbin, Xie Jian, and staff members of the department, totaling approximately 600 people, attended. The meeting commenced with music at 8:00 AM, presided over by Wang Zhaoming, who also delivered the opening address. The main points of Wang's speech are as follows: (1) First, he described the circumstances under which the Premier organized the revolutionary government at the time. At that time, most of China's provinces were still in the hands of the Northern Warlords. Although the Guangxi warlords had driven them out of Guangdong in November of the ninth year of the Republic, they still entrenched themselves in Guangxi and colluded with the Northern Warlords, eyeing Guangdong covetously. Although Guangdong was nominally the revolutionary base, Chen Jiongming harbored ulterior motives, posing a threat from within. It was at this time that the Premier established the revolutionary government in Guangzhou to confront the Northern Warlords. Even though the incident of June 16th in the eleventh year of the Republic was anticipated, he resolutely proceeded, determined to awaken the revolutionary ideals in all Party comrades and the national populace and to advance vigorously. His spirit of responsibility and sacrifice was truly the highest model for comrades and the nation. (2) Next, he described the current environment. In terms of the scope of governance, it is certainly wider than the provinces under the jurisdiction of the revolutionary government at the time. However, strictly speaking, it has still not achieved complete unification politically and economically, and the severity of the national crisis is even greater than it was then. Furthermore, the communist bandits have not yet been completely suppressed, and the silver issue has had an extremely detrimental impact on the nation's finance and various industries and commerce, hindering economic construction and making it difficult to proceed. In this environment, we can only emulate the Premier, taking on the spirit of responsibility and sacrifice, and working vigorously. (3) He further stated that the progress of economic construction depends on the removal of obstacles in politics and military affairs and on self-reliance in the economy itself. Although there are myriad difficulties, the key points are still nothing more than striving for austerity and savings in terms of expenditure, and striving for gradual accumulation in terms of construction. Regarding the first point, the budget for the 24th year is currently being prepared, starting with the Executive Yuan and its affiliated ministries and commissions, and jointly researching with other agencies to merge redundant organizations and reduce redundant personnel. All other administrative expenses will also be strictly reduced. This will not only make the savings available for project expenditures, but also improve administrative efficiency. Regarding the second point, the gradual accumulation over the years has not been without achievement, but we must work even harder to make it more scientific and rational. (4) Finally, he reiterated that the Premier's spirit of responsibility and sacrifice is the fundamental force for all our actions today. Whether our aspirations and goals can be achieved depends on our spirit of responsibility and sacrifice. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM after the speech. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial service for the revolutionary government at 10:00 AM on the 5th. Dai Chuanxian, Deng Jiayan, Chen Diaoyuan, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Musong, Chen Daqi, Wang Yongbin, Chen Xunyong, Lin Xiang, Chen Zhuo, Wei Huai, and other senior officers of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, as well as National Government staff, totaling more than 600 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered a speech, stating that today is the 5/5 Memorial Day, commemorating the 14th anniversary of the day when the Premier of our Party took office as the Extraordinary Grand President in Guangdong and established the revolutionary government. In the tenth year of the Republic, domestic counter-revolutionaries colluded with warlords and imperialists to extinguish the revolutionary forces led by the Premier of our Party, and the foundation of the Republic was shaken. Therefore, the Premier did not avoid all difficulties and resolutely took office, stepping forward to fight against all counter-revolutionary forces. Although some people at the time inevitably had many doubts about the Premier taking office, the day the Premier took office was delayed by as long as a month from the time of the extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly. The reason for this twist and turn was that the comrades did not fully believe in the Premier's great spirit, did not thoroughly study the Premier's doctrines, resulting in a lack of firm confidence, a lack of diligence in obeying orders, and shortsighted people were even more concerned with gains and losses, harboring the idea of temporary security, and failing to recognize the significance of the Premier taking office as President at that time in order to exercise his powers to unify China. This was the course of events when the Premier took office as President. From this, we can know that if there had been no Premier's spirit of fearlessness at that time, the revolution could not have been completed, and there would be no Republic of China today. At this time of national crisis, we should uphold the Premier's spirit of fearlessness, and advance vigorously at all times to save the country, so as not to fail the Premier's arduous efforts. Our memorial today should especially strive to carry out the legacy, make up for shortcomings, and hope that our colleagues will encourage each other, etc. Then Zheng Lusheng gave a speech. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM after the speech and music. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

Li returned to the defense zone in the afternoon of the 5th to proceed with the downsizing. Li Yuncheng said that because the downsizing system and the number of personnel in his unit have not been determined, he came to Tianjin specifically to request instructions. Now that it has been decided, one corps will have three battalions, each battalion will have three companies, and each company will have 125 men. Liu Benzhi's and Sun Yucheng's units will be downsized first, which is no problem. After the downsizing is completed, Feng Shoupeng's unit will be reorganized into one battalion. In summary, one corps will have a total of 1,000 officers and soldiers, and will be reorganized according to the prescribed number. Furthermore, Li was originally a battalion commander of the Northeast Army's reclamation unit before the 9/18 Incident, and was promoted to brigade commander for his merits.

<h3>Reflections on the Anglo-American Exclusion of Chinese Eggs</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Egg products have always held an important position among China's export goods. Since the European War, a large quantity has been sold to Europe, America, and Japan. Besides silk and tea, eggs can be considered a major commodity. European and American countries have long recognized the urgent need for fresh eggs and egg products. However, domestic production is insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, in the past, they generally exempted or even subsidized imports. According to the 1913 US tariff, fresh eggs were completely exempt from import duties. Liquid eggs were taxed at US $0.02 per pound, and dry egg products were taxed at US $0.06 per pound. The United Kingdom also completely exempted egg imports in the past. According to customs statistics, the total value of China's fresh egg and egg product exports reached a record of over 79.7 million yuan in 1930. Subsequently, the US and the UK gradually increased import taxes on Chinese eggs. China's total export value decreased to over 58.8 million yuan in 1931, over 44.3 million yuan in 1932, over 36.4 million yuan in the year before last, and only over 30.2 million yuan last year. The difference in the past five years has exceeded one time. As a result, domestic egg prices continued to fall. In previous years, fresh egg prices in spring ranged from 17 or 18 yuan to 21 yuan per load. In summer, they ranged from 15 or 16 yuan to 17 or 18 yuan. In autumn and winter, due to higher consumption, the prices increased, generally ranging from 20 yuan to 27 or 28 yuan. In recent years, however, the price has been only 14 or 15 yuan in spring and only 11 or 12 yuan in summer. Even during the peak season in autumn and winter, it is only 15 or 16 yuan to 21 or 22 yuan. Taking last year as an example, the estimated loss from the sharp drop in egg prices reached over 10 million yuan. Last year, fresh egg exports were approximately 34,500 tons, of which only one-third was exported by the Chinese businesses Maochang, Zhongyang, and Lihuan. The business results were generally losses. This year, inventories are piled up, and foreign sales are sluggish. The government has provided relief in the form of tax-exempt exports. However, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign news reported that the US Congress has proposed increasing sales taxes on eggs. Dry egg whites would be subject to an additional $0.31, totaling US $0.58 per pound, which is more than one time the cargo price. Dry egg yolks would also be subject to an additional $0.31, totaling US $0.58 per pound, which is more than four times the cargo price. Liquid eggs would also be subject to an additional $0.15, totaling US $0.26, which is approximately two times the cargo price. The UK House of Commons made unfavorable comments on the import of our liquid eggs, claiming that the production was dirty, the feed for the hens was unclean, and it did not meet human consumption standards. Newspapers also published a fabricated report after a certain British scholar's chemical test of samples. It was said that it contained excessive microbial components. One chemical test allegedly found as many as 1.5 million living microorganisms per square centimeter. Therefore, it could not be considered a satisfactory product. This criticism was undoubtedly prompted by the British Poultry Association. Although the British Secretary of Health repeatedly responded and pathologists prepared a report after careful inspection, confirming that it met the satisfactory standards of cleanliness and purity and also met the microbial standards required for "A" grade milk, the public has deliberately excluded it as a result.</p>
<p>The inspection and export of our fresh eggs and egg products are subject to strict inspection by the Bureau of Commodity Inspection. Spoiled and inferior goods should not be mixed in and damage our credibility. Now that the British are making unfounded accusations about the quality of Chinese eggs, deliberately excluding them and claiming to have chemical test results as evidence, we believe that the authorities should take urgent measures to respond to the Anglo-American increase in import taxes on Chinese eggs. However, our Bureau of Commodity Inspection should also publicize the inspection results to dispel public doubts and issue a rebuttal to counter the British's malicious propaganda to protect the reputation of our fresh eggs and egg products in foreign countries. This is also a necessary measure to promote the export of our country's products.</p>
<p>Correction: In the last section of yesterday's current affairs commentary, the phrase "Now, regarding the British Foreign Secretary's statement the day before..." should read "Prime Minister" instead of "Foreign Secretary." Also, in the same section, the sentence "He also sent a letter to the then ambassador to Germany, Gauss Tai" should read "Gauss Qin" instead of "Gauss Tai." The British ambassador to Germany at the time was Sir E. Goschen.</p>

<h3>Philippine Authorities Plan to Request Japan to Extradite Rebellious Leader Ramos Now Publishes Newspaper in Tokyo Advocating Separation from American Autocracy Quezon Asks the United States to Improve its Economic Policy Toward the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to a Manila dispatch today, the Philippine authorities are currently considering requesting Japan to extradite the rebellious leader Ramos.

<p>Quezon Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>(Washington) Philippine Senate President Quezon published an article today, which appeared in various newspapers, stating that Filipinos are complaining about the United States' restrictions on the import of Philippine goods. The independence plan places very strict restrictions on tax-free Philippine goods entering the United States. Anyone who knows the actual situation in the Philippines would have predicted two years ago that this move would greatly hinder the Philippine economy. We protested at the time, stating that if implemented, it would cause many Filipinos to lose their jobs, reduce their standard of living, and cause hardship and widespread discontent. Quezon continued, "The recent unrest in the Philippines is not political in nature," and he condemned the leaders of the rebels for exploiting the current economic difficulties and inciting the public, calling them political criminals. Quezon concluded by asking the US authorities to revise the US economic policy toward the Philippines as stipulated in the independence plan and subsequent laws so that both parties can benefit.

It is reported that today's meeting focused on technical issues, resulting in a more positive outcome. Italy is seeking a compromise to acknowledge Hungary's demands for military equality and to allow Hungary to purchase certain agricultural products as a preferential measure. Therefore, Hungary has expressed its willingness to compromise and attend the Rome Nine-Power Conference.

If Italy and Yugoslavia become closer, Hungary's exports may be affected. It is generally believed that Hungary's political demands include the following two items: (1) The Marseilles assassination case must be definitively resolved by the League of Nations before the opening of the Rome Conference. (2) The issue of Hungary's rearmament must be formally raised for discussion at the Rome Conference. Italy believes that this should be handled by the League of Nations.

<p>A Glimpse of French Press Commentary</p>
<p>(Paris) The French press has offered limited criticism of the trilateral Venice meeting between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Some newspapers have published commentaries, all expressing deep concern that Hungary's demands (namely, the demand to rearm and the demand that the League of Nations Council resolve the responsibility for the Marseilles assassination case at its next meeting) may be supported by Italy. For example, the renowned reporter Saint-Brice commented in "Le Journal" that "To what extent can Italy free itself from its old constraints? Can Italy enable Hungary to join a Central European organization and obtain a way to guarantee Austria's independence?" Figaro reporter Dolmetsch wrote that the Danube River issue is extremely complex and hopes that France and Italy have a strong will to guarantee Austria's independence. "Le Temps Nouveau" wrote that "Italy is truly in a dilemma. If it supports Hungary, it will inevitably provoke the dissatisfaction of the Little Entente. If it opposes Hungary's demands, it risks driving Hungary into the arms of National Socialism. It is difficult to achieve both." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Criticizes the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, Calling it a Military Alliance Against Germany, Intended to Prepare for a World War</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, all German newspapers unanimously criticized the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact signed in Paris on May 2nd, calling it a military alliance against Germany, sufficient to endanger European peace. They also claimed that in addition to the formal treaty, there was a secret "Supplementary Agreement." One newspaper reported a claim that if Soviet Russia needed to send troops to aid France against Germany, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu would allow Russian troops to pass through Romanian territory. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Sources in the German Foreign Ministry believe the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is a direct threat to Germany. They claim that in addition to the mutual assistance treaty, France and the Soviet Union have also concluded a secret military alliance, solely aimed at dealing with Germany. France has also lent 500 million francs to cover Soviet military expenses. German newspapers reported that the Russian air force has already built airfields in Czechoslovakia, and Romania has signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to allow Soviet troops to pass through Romanian territory. They also said that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is being implemented within the framework of the League of Nations, which further increases Germany's antipathy towards the League of Nations. Under the pressure of France and Russia, the League of Nations will become even more unscrupulous. The German newspaper "Germania" stated, "The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is clearly designed specifically for a certain country. This is the harbinger of a revival of pre-war alliance concepts, which is chilling. This move has serious repercussions for Germany and Europe, which we are deeply aware of. Germany will definitely find a way to retaliate." The "People's Observer" criticized France and the Soviet Union, saying that their intention is to prepare for a world war. They also stated, "France's extreme nationalism will inevitably lead to the spread of Bolshevism throughout Europe. British Foreign Secretary Simon recently declared that after Britain reaffirms its obligations under the Locarno Treaty, if France helps Russia attack Germany, Britain will definitely take a stance against France. Moscow was outraged by Simon's remarks, and therefore concluded a defensive alliance with France." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Reducing the Potential for Russo-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the German authorities strongly disapprove of the military alliance between France and Russia. A senior official told the Associated Press, "This is a return to the pre-war system of military treaties. Germany is strongly opposed to this system and does not believe that military alliances are conducive to peace." At the same time, Moscow, Paris, and even Washington all praised the final signing of the Franco-Russian treaty as a major step in maintaining European peace. French Foreign Minister Laval announced in Paris that he will carry a draft of the Eastern European Pact next week and travel to Warsaw and Moscow via Berlin. Although Laval said that his transit through Berlin was to save time and he did not expect Germany to avoid meeting with him, observers believe that Laval's trip may open up a channel for Franco-German negotiations. It is an open secret that France and Russia will invite Poland and Czechoslovakia to join the defensive mutual assistance pact, and the Franco-Russian treaty is not limited to other countries joining, so Germany may also be invited. However, recently both French and Russian authorities have publicly expressed opposition to the Nazi government of German leader Hitler, so some observers believe that Hitler will not conduct any negotiations before the Anglo-German naval conference in mid-May. Political observers and some officials in Washington believe that the Franco-Russian treaty is actually beneficial to peace and can affect the Far East. If Soviet Russia has the assistance of France in the European theater, its position in dealing with Japan will be more stable. American strategists believe that as long as Russia has sufficient strength to deal with Europe, the risk of a Russo-Japanese conflict can be reduced. It is also remembered that recently there were rumors of a German-Japanese alliance to deal with Soviet Russia. Both Germany and Japan have categorically denied this, and since the end of the Sino-Eastern Railway negotiations, Russo-Japanese relations have also greatly improved. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Russian Newspapers Unanimously Praise</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, all Soviet newspapers commented on the signing of the Franco-Soviet pact. An editorial in Pravda stated that the conclusion of this mutual assistance pact is not only satisfactory to the working masses of the Soviet Union and France, but also welcomed by all those who uphold peace. The "Industrial Gazette," the organ of the Heavy Industry Committee, stated that this pact is a new and important step taken by France and the Soviet Union, and a great success for them in promoting peace. This agreement was signed by great and powerful countries, so it must have great "prophetic" importance for those who harbor aggressive intentions. In other words, it must serve as a warning. They must constantly feel that France and the Soviet Union are willing to turn this pact into an instrument that knows no refusal." The newspaper also stated that the political friendship between France and the Soviet Union must be based on a suitable economic foundation. "The Soviet Union has achieved great success in its struggle for peace. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union, with its economic defense capabilities, has become the greatest country internationally. All the masses in various countries who seek peace cannot but have sympathy for this." The "Youth Pravda" of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League stated that this pact is in line with the Soviet Union's entire policy and the agreements it has signed with various countries. Its only purpose is peace, to restrain European provocateurs, and to consolidate strength to assist the Soviet Union and even the security of Europe and the world. (TASS dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Election Competition Throughout France for Municipal Elections, Newspapers Satirize Female Candidates</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today is the date for the re-election of the municipal councilors throughout the country. Most newspaper commentary focuses on this matter. In principle, the re-election of the municipal council only involves administrative and technical matters, but judging from the campaign activities and newspaper commentary everywhere, it clearly has a political nature. The French Senate will re-elect one-third of its members in October this year, which will be elected by municipal councilors from various provinces. Recently, right-wing newspapers have published articles urging voters to participate in the voting and oppose the joint front of the Socialist and Communist parties, while left-wing and far-left newspapers have called for voting against fascism.

<p>(Paris) Today, municipal elections are being held throughout the country. There are several female candidates, but French women currently do not have the right to participate in politics, and even if elected, they cannot attend. In recent days, newspapers have published many satires about female candidates. There are 38,000 ballot boxes across the country, with 450,000 councilor seats and 4 million candidates.

<h3>Rumors of Aviation Competition in the Far East among Britain, France, and the Netherlands, Britain Opens Singapore-Hong Kong Route</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a recent telegram from a certain source, the British government has ordered its aviation authorities to investigate and plan an air route in the Far East, from Singapore via Borneo to Hong Kong. The Netherlands also has a route from its own country via Bangkok to Singapore, Batavia, Surabaya, and other places. France already has a route from Singapore to Saigon, and this year it will reach Hanoi in Annam via Bangkok and then reach Hong Kong. The test flight here has been completed. Although Britain possesses the Malay archipelago, it seems to be slightly behind in the aviation business, so it has taken this action. It is mainly competing with France, so it has changed its plan and decided to go from Singapore to British Borneo, via Manila to Hong Kong, opening this new air route. The Netherlands feels threatened by Britain's above plan, so it plans to counter Britain with this route from Surabaya to Borneo. In this way, Britain, France, and the Netherlands are launching a battle for air supremacy in the Far East, which is why Japan is very concerned about the above situation.

<h3>Memel Issue, Lithuania's Reply, Britain, France, and Italy Consider it Unsatisfactory</h3>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Britain, France, and Italy consider Lithuania's reply regarding the violation of the Memel Treaty to be unsatisfactory. The reply from the powers will lead to new diplomatic action starting next week. Lithuania has learned that if the plan adopted by the governments of the powers fails to satisfy the signatories of the Memel Treaty, it will apply to the League of Nations on this matter. Britain, France, and Italy all believe that the participation of Germans in the administration is entirely possible without harming the sovereignty of the powers. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>The capitals of Lithuania, Britain, France, and Italy previously protested jointly to the Lithuanian government that the current administrative committee of the Memel region failed to obtain the trust of the autonomous parliament, and the Lithuanian government still maintained it. This clearly disregarded the Memel Convention jointly guaranteed by the three countries and violated the provisions of the region's autonomous constitution. After several days, no reply was received. Now Lithuanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ulmanis has submitted his country's reply to the diplomatic representatives of the three countries in Lithuania. The text still defends his country's position and proposes that three members of the German party can be added to the five administrative committee members of the Memel autonomous government for mediation. In addition, the Lithuanian government requested that the country's security be guaranteed. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Wu Zhihui Gives a Speech in Guizhou</h3>
<p>Guiyang: On the 4th, all schools in the province welcomed Wu Zhihui at the auditorium of the Senior High School, with thousands of people attending. Wu gave a speech for more than an hour. The main points of the speech were: 1. Guizhou's landscape is excellent and its reserves are very rich. Roads must be built to facilitate transportation and develop mineral resources. Education must be relied upon to cultivate various talents. 2. The situation in Guizhou Province was not good before, but it is different now, so I hope that you will not be estranged from the central government and not stay outside the government. If educational funding is difficult, you can ask the government to find a way. 3. China's educational regulations are quite complete, but its shortcomings are that they do not conform to actual situations and cannot be done practically. In a modern country, the revival of China lies in teaching the people of the whole country to become capable people. Education is not about learning the latest fashions, but about being realistic. 4. China's major problems are rural bankruptcy and the influx of foreign goods. To seek relief, we must resist imperialism, follow the teachings of the President, and catch up. To be able to catch up, we must make the best use of people's talents, land, and things. 5. I hope that in the future, teachers and students will work hard in a realistic way to save the nation and the country. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Northwest Inspection Report</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Shaanxi's Construction Undertakings and Plans (Part 1)</p>
<p>Shaanxi, known in ancient times as a fertile land of thousands of miles, with secure passes (namely Xiao, Wu, Hangu, and Dashan Passes), is now the hub of the Northwest, with a significant strategic position. Since the loss of the Northeast, calls for developing the Northwest have surged, gradually becoming reality. Shaanxi, with its superior historical and geographical advantages, has become the center of construction in the Northwest development process. The central government, local authorities, and financial and industrial circles all pay attention and provide assistance, so its construction undertakings are flourishing. However, all parties agree that the basic construction work needs to be expedited. One is the improvement of water conservancy, which can increase production and revive the rural economy. The other is the development of transportation, so agricultural products and raw materials can reach coastal export markets. Therefore, Shaanxi's construction work in recent years has increasingly focused on water conservancy and transportation, and the achievements are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Water Conservancy Construction</p>
<p>(1) Jinghui Canal: Originally built by the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the China International Famine Relief Commission, it was severely damaged by floods in 1933. Subsequently, the National Economic Council assessed the repair cost at more than 239,000 yuan and undertook to improve the water diversion facilities. The repair of the main canal and the north branch canal and other projects have all been completed and can release water smoothly. The design of the south branch canal has been improved to adjust the slope, and three channels, namely South One, North One and North Four branch canals, have been added, and the South One branch canal has been extended to the Jinghe River bank, and a telephone communication network has been set up in the irrigation area to facilitate transportation. In addition to the three branch canals under construction, the canal's water supply totals 234 days per year. The maximum monthly average water supply is approximately 13.81 cubic meters per second, and the minimum water supply is approximately 9.50 cubic meters per second. The irrigation area covers five counties: Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Liquan and Lintong, with a total irrigated area of 569,900 mu. Excluding the land that has not benefited, it is about 453,000 mu. The new construction projects will be fully completed this year, increasing the irrigated area by 600,000 mu. The crop yield per mu, with the most abundant summer crops, is three shi of barley, one shi and seven dou of wheat, and one shi and five dou of rapeseed. The average yield is one shi and eight dou of barley, and one shi and one dou of wheat and rapeseed, respectively. The autumn harvest is the most abundant at nearly one hundred jin of cotton, with an average of forty to fifty jin.</p>
<p>(2) Luohui Canal: Undertaken by the National Economic Council, it is currently under construction. The main canal is 21 kilometers long, and the middle, east, west, middle-east, and middle-west canals are 78 kilometers long in total. The irrigation area is 934 square li, equivalent to 500,400 mu. The project and recurring expenses require 1,466,000 yuan. The main canal project can be completed this summer. All other projects, including the main and branch canals in the middle, east and west sections, are scheduled to be completed in the early summer of 1936.</p>
<p>(3) Weihui Canal: Proposed by Lu Yizhai of Huayin, it was repeatedly discussed by Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts last year. The Water Conservancy Bureau sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys of the river course and irrigation area, and it was decided to build a barrage dam west of Mei County, and dig canals from the north bank, from the main canal to the branch canals. This can irrigate the vast plains east of Mei County, such as Wugong, Xingping, and Xianyang counties, covering 500 square kilometers. With an 80% effective irrigation area, this amounts to more than 360 square li, or about 600,000 mu. The water source will be used for all fertile land. The total project cost is approximately 2 million yuan. The loan of 1.5 million yuan guaranteed by water use donations has been jointly borrowed from Shanghai banking circles. It is estimated that the entire project will be completed in three years, and the annual increase in productivity will be at least 6 million yuan. In particular, the sharp increase in wheat and cotton production will be astonishing. Thus, three of the so-called "Eight Benefits of Guanzhong" will be realized in sequence, and half of the irrigation area will be covered. Li Yizhi, director of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, has seen the sharp increase in cotton and wheat production and the rise of cooperative ventures in the Jinghui Canal area. He believes that the Luohui and Weihui Canals will be completed soon. He further plans to divert and irrigate other rivers and consolidate and expand existing water conservancy facilities, such as the Meihui, Longhui, Lihui, Yaohui, Longhui, Dinghui, Juhui, Pinghui, and Lengshui, Lianshui, Heishui, Laoshui, Muma River, Danjiang, and Hanjiang Rivers. These are all included in Li's ten-year water conservancy project plan. If all the powerful parties can unanimously support and complete the projects on schedule, making farmland water conservancy universal throughout the province, and then extending to navigation water conservancy and other engineering facilities, then Shaanxi, which has suffered from major droughts every thirty years and minor droughts every ten years, can easily become a model agricultural water conservancy area.</p>
<p>The Wei River Baoji Gorge Reservoir Plan by water conservancy experts Xu Zhongquan and German Mr. Barge is also noteworthy. The Wei River is one of the largest tributaries of the Yellow River, and the relationship between the Yellow River and the Wei River is close, and their interests are interdependent. Every year in May and June, the Wei River's flow is constantly less than thirty cubic meters per second, when the flow of the Yellow River at Tongguan is 150 cubic meters per second. However, during the flood season, the situation changes dramatically. The flow of the Yellow River at Tongguan is only about 1,000 cubic meters, while the flow of the Wei River sometimes rises to more than 10,000 cubic meters, with turbulent waves rushing into the Yellow River. The theory that it is the main cause of the Yellow River disaster is well-founded. Tracing the Wei River from Weiyuan County in Gansu Province, passing through Liupan from the west, converging its tributaries, winding through the mountains, to the Baoji County boundary, it then exits the valley to the east and flows into the plain. The cliffs on both sides of the valley are steep and narrow, resembling a natural gateway, which is indeed a good place to build a reservoir. There are many bends in the gorge, and the slope is steep. From the mouth of the gorge to Shimen, the horizontal distance is about 40 kilometers. The tributary network is dense, and the water storage capacity is quite abundant. If a reservoir can be built here, then</p>
<h3>Two Assassination Cases Occur in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin; Two Presidents of Reactionary Newspapers Die One After Another</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Two assassination cases occurred in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin at approximately 11:00 p.m. on May 2 and 4:00 a.m. on May 3. The victims were Hu Enpu, president of Guoquan Bao, and Bai Yuhuan, president of Zhen Bao. The details are recorded as follows: Guoquan Bao of Tianjin was published in January of this year. The newspaper office was located on Suma Street in the Japanese Concession. The main person in charge was Hu Sipu, 52 years old, from Zhejiang. Hu had been a staff member under Shi Yousan and Zhang Zongchang for many years. The capital for founding Guoquan Bao came from a group of frustrated warlords and politicians. Not long after its publication, the newspaper published the declaration of the China Guoquan Society, published the party platform, and organized the Guoquan General Society. The news published in the newspaper was all original, and under the orders of frustrated warlords and politicians in the Japanese Concession, he went to Changchun with his concubine Shen Zhujun and had contact with the puppet regime. On April 29, he returned from Changchun. At that time, he seemed to know the danger he was in, so he changed his concubine's name and rented Room 16 on the lower floor of the Beiyang Hotel on Xintai Street in the Japanese Concession in the name of Shen Zhujun, a writer. At 11:05 p.m. on May 2, Hu was talking with Japanese Matsuda Hachiro and his concubine in the room. A car, marked by the concession as 1063, drove to the front of the hotel. Two people resembling workers came down from the car, went straight into the hotel, pushed open the door of Room 16, and fired two shots into the room, both hitting Hu in the chest. He fell to the ground immediately. Because the bullets were so powerful, they pierced through his back and injured Matsuda's right shoulder and spleen, and Ms. Shen's right hand. The assailant rushed out of the door, jumped into the car, and sped away along the Haihe River. The Japanese police officers originally in front of the Beiyang Hotel did not pay attention because they saw that the car number belonged to Shi Yousan, and let them speed away. When the Japanese police station heard the news, it sent Judicial Section Director Owa and Criminal Section Director Sakurai to arrive at the scene for inspection. Hu was already barely breathing and was taken to the Yanegu Hospital on Asahi Street. An injection of a cardiac stimulant was ineffective, and he died at 1:30 a.m. on the 3rd. His family did not want to report to the authorities, so they took the body back to his Chunri Street residence for funeral arrangements, and sought a place for temporary burial. Guoquan Bao suspended publication on the 3rd. Bai Yuhuan, president of Zhen Bao, relied on the Japanese Concession as a shield and published reactionary newspapers, attacking the current government and officials. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 3rd, three young men arrived in a car and stopped at the entrance of Yideli on Suma Street. There were originally six night watchmen in the alley, who were very strict in questioning outsiders. Early that morning, the gatekeepers were dozing off, so they allowed the three young men to find Bai's residence at No. 33, took out axes and saws, dug a hole in the door, drilled into the courtyard, went upstairs and went straight into Bai's bedroom. At this time, Bai and his four-year-old son Zhen</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Ying had fallen asleep. The three young men each took out a handgun and fired three shots, one hitting Bai in the head, one in the chest, and one in the buttocks. He died instantly, and a stray bullet injured his son's leg. Bai's wife, Ms. Lin, was sleeping in the next room. Hearing the sound, she put on her clothes and went out to look. The three young men rushed out, escaped through the hole in the door, got into the car at the entrance of the alley, and sped away. The Japanese police station received the report and searched for a long time, but found nothing. However, the six night watchmen at the entrance of the alley did not hear anything about the murderer's coming and going, which was very suspicious. They were specially summoned for questioning. At noon, Judge Guo from the court went to the scene for inspection and found a sealed letter written by Bai to a certain department of the Kwantung Army in a small pocket on Bai's body. The content was mostly about North China's secrets, which was a type of intelligence secret document. In the afternoon, his family bought a coffin for burial. Although Zhen Bao was not suspended, it no longer had the editorials written by Bai every day. Bai was 61 years old, from Hubei, and was an old member of the Tongmenghui. In recent years, he colluded with a certain party and a certain country, and was supported by frustrated warlords and politicians in Tianjin. His remarks and news attacked the government. Zhen Bao was published in the summer of 1933, initially as one large sheet, and later changed to two large sheets. Bai served as president and chief writer. On November 28, 1933, he was assassinated by three young men. At that time, Bai was living at No. 2 Gengyuli, Suma Street, Japanese Concession. He was taking a bath that day when he was shot twice but did not die. After recovering, he continued to scold the government. Recently, he and the traitorous ambitious warlords and politicians in the opposition, and Hu Enpu, president of Guoquan Bao, were engaged in some kind of conspiracy, which had not yet matured. He was now shot and killed in his sleep. When the news of his death spread, everyone cheered for it. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Remnant Bandits in Northeastern Fujian Gradually Cleared</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Plans to Help Farmers in Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Two groups of Red Bandits who had previously infiltrated from the Zhejiang and Jiangxi borders into northern Fujian, respectively through Chong'an, Pucheng, Jianyang, Shaowu, Mingxi, Qingliu, Yong'an, and Shaxian, attempted to gather in Shunchang and Jiangle. However, they were blocked and attacked by various troops, and the bandits' forces could not succeed. The area gradually stabilized. Currently, only scattered bandits in groups of two to three hundred people remain in the remote areas at the borders of Shaxian and Yong'an, Mingxi and Qingliu, Jiangle and Shunchang, Shunchang and Shaxian, Jiangle and Shaxian, Jiangle and Mingxi, Mingxi and Shaxian, and Mingxi and Yong'an. They appear and harass from time to time. When the military arrives to suppress them, they flee into the mountains. According to information obtained yesterday, the scattered bandits among the six counties of Jiang, Shun, Sha, Yong, Ming, and Qing have recently been killed by the 45th and 52nd Divisions, numbering more than 600 people. Only more than 400 remnant bandits remain, divided into two groups. One group fled from Shaxian to Youxi, and the other group fled from Yong'an to Liancheng. The 45th Division has dispatched teams to pursue and suppress the bandits from Yong'an to Liancheng, and the 52nd Division has dispatched teams to pursue and suppress the bandits from Shaxian to Youxi, with the aim of eliminating them.</p>
<p>Since Feng Pintai went missing and Lai Jinbiao was killed, the remnant bandits in eastern Fujian have only five to six hundred people. Under the command of Jing Yu and Liu Ying, they are surrounded by the Fujian and Zhejiang armies in the four counties of Shouning, Songxi, Jingning, and Qingyuan on the border of the two provinces. Shi Honglie, the new commander of the 10th Division, is personally supervising the suppression in Shouning. His troops have advanced to Huangpi, north of Qingyuan, to cooperate with the Zhejiang army in the pursuit and suppression. It is expected that the bandits will be wiped out in a short period of time. The authorities believe that eastern Fujian has suffered from banditry for a long time, and the people have suffered greatly. Now that the Red atmosphere has been quelled, relief should be planned as soon as possible. It has been decided to start with Lianjiang and Luoyuan counties first. The Provincial Rural Finance Relief Office will borrow 50,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank, with 30,000 yuan going to Lianjiang and 20,000 yuan going to Luoyuan, to provide rural loans to farmers for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers for spring plowing. The post-disaster affairs of Fu'an, Ningde, Xiapu, and Fuding counties are also being planned by the Second District Administrative Commissioner's Office. (4th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Pirates Rob the Lujiang Steamer</h3>
<p>More Than Twenty Highly Organized Pirates Loot a Staggering 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Cases of pirates robbing ships along the coast of Fujian Province occur from time to time. On April 30, the Lujiang steamer of the Xiamen Taili Shipping Company was robbed by more than twenty pirates while sailing from Hanjiang to Xiamen. The loss reached 200,000 yuan, breaking the previous record for large-scale robbery. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Lujiang steamer sails between Xiamen and Hanjiang, which belongs to Xinghua. On April 30, it returned from Hanjiang, carrying more than 300 passengers and goods. As usual, the customs and water police stationed there inspected the ship. It set sail southward at 11:00 a.m. After sailing for just one hour, at 12:00 noon, it sailed past "Bianbei" in Hanjiang Port. Suddenly, four gunshots were heard on the ship, and the crowd was in an uproar. More than twenty pirates disguised as passengers appeared, each holding a Browning pistol or a handgun. They divided into groups, with four people guarding the helm and four people confiscating the three rifles and one handgun prepared for anti-piracy on the ship. The remaining pirates then searched the passengers and crew one by one. The pirates guarding the helm forced the helmsman to steer the ship near Xian'an's Qian Port. They continued to rob while sailing. All passengers were forced to hand over their luggage and belongings. At 3:00 p.m., the ship arrived at Qian Port, and the pirates ordered it to drop anchor. After about half an hour, four large sailing boats were seen approaching from afar, each with three or four pirates on board. Once they were close to the ship, the pirates on board transferred the looted goods to the four boats and set sail towards the mountains near Qian Port. Afterwards, four more boats arrived, and the looted goods were transferred completely. The pirates also disembarked one after another and headed towards Dui Mountain. At that time, it was already 6:30 p.m. on the 30th. When the pirates started the robbery on the ship, the first gunshots rang out. Lin Ajiao, a passenger from Xinghua who sold eggs, was shot in the abdomen and died on the spot. Three other passengers were slightly injured. The deceased's brother, Lin Asheng, cried bitterly while holding his brother's body. The pirates told him not to cry and gave him 70 yuan after the robbery, saying that this was enough for his brother's funeral expenses. Each passenger was given back two yuan, saying it was a small amount for ferry fare. There were more than twenty pirates in total, including three women, all dressed in student attire. The rest wore a mix of long robes and short clothes. They spoke the Xinghua dialect and occasionally switched to the Minnan dialect. Their equipment was excellent and they were highly organized. After the pirates left, some people secretly recorded the license plate numbers of their sailing boats. The ship set sail immediately and sailed to Xiamen overnight to report the incident. It entered the port at 8:00 a.m. on May 1. From afar, customs officer Shan Yuansi saw the ship's flag hanging upside down, knew that something had happened, and immediately notified the Second Brigade of the Water Police. Inspector Director Zeng Shida led team leaders Li Guangwei and Wu Xueyi, and together with inspection officer Liu Zhengping, boarded the ship for inspection and took the related parties to the team for questioning. As a result, three people were detained pending further investigation. A telegram was also sent to the coastal police teams to investigate and arrest the eight sailing boats and bring them to justice. The body was inspected by the Siming District Court, and the Taili Company purchased a coffin for burial. As for the looted losses, with the recent rise in silver prices, profiteers have been purchasing silver from the mainland and transporting it to Xiamen. The Lujiang ship was carrying a large amount of cash this time, so the losses were extremely heavy. According to the investigation, the amount was 200,000 yuan, truly a massive robbery unprecedented in Fujian. Afterwards, the Taili Company submitted a report to the Shipping Association, stating, "(Omitted above) The company's ship was robbed of 8,250 yuan, three rifles, and one six-shot handgun. Passenger Lin Ajiao was killed, and three people were slightly injured. As for the silver and goods robbed from the passengers, there is no way to count them. The pirates who robbed the ship this time numbered more than twenty, all with good weapons, and should be a large and organized gang of bandits. If this situation is not strictly suppressed, how can the route be peaceful? We should submit a separate report to the military and political authorities, setting a time limit for assisting in the arrest and bringing them to justice," and so on. (May 4)</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Survey Mission Arrives in Qingdao to Investigate Industry and Commerce for Two Days</h3>

<h3>Shandong Construction Department Sends Personnel to Survey the Tuhai River</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Tuhai River passes through more than ten counties in northern Shandong, with a length of more than 700 li. It is the largest river in northern Shandong. Every year during the autumn and summer, rainwater from more than ten counties flows into the river and enters the sea from Zhanhua. It is of great importance to flood drainage. It was renovated once in the 20th year. Fortunately, there have been no floods in recent years. Construction Department Director Zhang Honglie, now that spring is going and summer is coming, in order to plan ahead, specially sent technician Zhang Junsen to survey whether it still needs to be excavated and whether the bridges are damaged. After Zhang received the order, he set off from Ji'nan on the 30th of last month, starting from the downstream estuary and heading upstream, passing through Zhanhua, Bin County, Huimin, Shanghe, Jiyang, Linyi, Qihe, Yucheng, Gaotang, Boping, Liaocheng, Yanggu, Shen County, and parts of Chaocheng and Renping counties. He returned to Ji'nan today (3rd) to report to the Construction Department. It is said that this time, the survey of the Tuhai River focused on three points: (1) Estuary: The estuary is still smooth. The section from Liuzhongkou to Huangshengdian, which is more than 30 li long, has too little water to allow ships to pass. Local people hope to excavate and repair it to allow navigation to the sea. The upper section of this section can still be excavated with dredgers, but the lower section has too little water for dredgers to enter, so only manual labor can be used. This section is more than 30 li long, and the project is not small. Manual labor may not be able to handle it. If the government has surplus capacity, it can carry out this project. (2) Bridges: From Yucheng downwards, the downstream river channel of the Tuhai River is very wide. Upstream of Yucheng, the river channel is narrow, so there are more than one hundred bridges on the entire river. The upstream projects are smaller, and there are not many damaged ones. The downstream bridges are very large. This trip paid attention to the size, number, degree of damage, repair year, and estimated cost of reconstruction of each bridge. Bridges on provincial and county roads can still be passed, but village roads are less important and need more repairs. The oldest bridges were built during the Ming Dynasty, and some were destroyed by breaches of the Yellow River. In total, about six or seven tenths of the bridges on the entire river need to be repaired. It is best to rebuild them this year. (3) Water discharge: The river's greatest function is flood discharge, so the river water is very shallow on weekdays. Above Yucheng, there are places where the riverbed is completely dry, and nearby people often go there to cultivate. The downstream water depth is also no more than two chi, and the average water depth is more than one chi. The water discharge of the river is still smooth, and places that are unsuitable have been ordered to be rectified. However, the people on the dikes cultivate at will, damaging the dikes, which is very inappropriate and should be strictly prohibited by the government to ensure safety. (4th) -Total amount is 1.5 million yuan-</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Issues Short-Term Training Bonds</h3>
<p>—Total Amount: 1.5 Million Yuan—</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Hunan Province's finances have been greatly difficult since the abolition of Lijin. Monthly government expenditure is about 1 million yuan, while income only relies on about 400,000 yuan per month from production and sales taxes, about 300,000 yuan per month from land taxes, and about 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per month from slaughter, tooth shop, deed taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, there is a monthly deficit of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The temporary expenses required for bandit suppression and bunker construction, which often cost tens of thousands or one to two hundred thousand yuan, are not included. The accumulated deficits over the years have reached three to four million yuan. Last year, the province suffered a severe drought, and the land tax item was mostly reduced or exempted, which sharply reduced the provincial treasury's income. Since the abolition of the lunar calendar year, three months have already passed, but the operating expenses of various agencies have only been issued 30% of one month's amount. Zhang Kailian, Director of the Department of Finance, intends to issue 1.5 million yuan of short-term public bonds of the Hunan Provincial Government, specifically for paying the expenses of various agencies, to seek temporary relief. Starting from June 1 of this year, the expenses of various agencies will be issued every month. In addition to cash, the shortfall will be paid with these short-term treasury bonds, to match the amount that each agency should receive. The issuance period is limited to six months, and they will be fully redeemed at the provincial treasury when due, or used to pay taxes. The issuance regulations have been drafted and submitted to today's (3rd) Provincial Affairs Conference for deliberation and approval. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Provincial Anti-Opium Association Investigation Team Cracks Down on Local Opium Traffickers</h3>
<p>According to reports received by the Provincial Anti-Opium Committee, Liu Shutang, a businessman from elsewhere residing in Songjiang, has been trafficking opium for years. Despite the strict prohibition in place, he continues to operate this business, with significant sales. The committee dispatched investigators to Songjiang to collaborate with the county's Anti-Opium Association. Using thirty dollars in marked banknotes, they sent someone to Liu's place on the afternoon of the third to purchase ten taels of opium. Once the evidence was obtained, they, along with the police force, led by the investigators, knocked on Liu's door. Liu was hosting a banquet. Liu Shutang was immediately arrested, and a mountain pistol was found on his person, which he claimed was for self-defense and had been registered at the town office. The rooms were then searched, revealing the marked banknotes and several packets of illegal opium. Liu was taken to the county jail, shackled, and imprisoned, awaiting transfer to the province for interrogation and prosecution. It is reported that Liu's residence has been sealed by the county government. Also, at 8 PM the same evening, when the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train arrived at Songjiang Station, a man carrying a large package was found suspicious by police officer Lu Zhengxiang. When ordered to be inspected, the man abandoned the package and disappeared into the crowd in the dim light, escaping. Upon inspecting the package, it was found to be full of illegal opium, weighing 240 taels. It was taken to the responsible branch station and submitted with a document to the county anti-opium committee for review.</p>

<h3>Various Public Organizations Request Collection of Reserve Grain</h3>
<p>Since the tenth year of the Republic, the county has suffered from frequent floods. As of this year, the area of Xishan has been particularly barren. Initially, the county had a reserve grain system, but later the grain was converted into money, which was then used for other purposes. Therefore, it is impossible to provide emergency relief in the event of floods or droughts. Local public organizations feel that reserve grain is essential for disaster preparedness. They jointly submitted a petition to the provincial government and the departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction, as well as the government of Jiangdu County, proposing that the total amount of the local silver surtax be used as the standard for collecting reserve grain. It is reported that the county government believes the proposal is insightful and has added its reasons, forwarding it to the provincial departments for approval.</p>

At the same time, it received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate. After the county government sent staff to investigate, it was confirmed that the matter was true. In addition to transferring the case to the court for investigation and reporting to the Department of Civil Affairs, County Magistrate Ma issued a special order to all district chiefs, stating that if any township or town chiefs illegally collect donations in the future, the district chiefs should immediately stop them.

<h3>Huzhou: Civilization Bookstore Completely Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>At 4:30 AM on the 30th, a fire suddenly broke out at the Civilization Bookstore on Yishang Street in the city. The flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to approach. After firefighters from various districts rushed to put out the fire, it was extinguished. As a result, all two buildings of the bookstore and its business equipment and goods were reduced to ashes. When the fire was raging, there were still two apprentices sleeping upstairs. By the time they woke up and thought of escaping, it was too late. They each jumped from the windows to the street, falling on the waterfront and suffering serious injuries. They were sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: County Government Burns Native Silkworm Seeds</h3>
<p>The Xiaoshan County Government, in order to universally improve the sericulture industry, has established guidance centers in places such as Changhe Jian Xiaolou Jiatacun and Daicun at the request of the people, encouraging people to breed improved silkworm seeds. The existing native silkworm seeds can be exchanged for improved seeds at the guidance centers. The exchange period has ended, and a total of 1,635 native seeds have been collected and submitted to the county. The Construction Department of Zhejiang has requested the county government to present the request. On the 3rd, a special commissioner, Liu Sizan, was sent to Xiaoshan to supervise the burning of all the native seeds at the public sports field. Representatives from various agencies and groups were sent to the site to observe.</p>
<h3>Business Stagnation and Money Shops Stop Lending</h3>
<p>Due to the extremely tight money situation at the end of the third lunar month this year, the managers of the money shops in the city and countryside of Xiaoshan have stopped all long-term lending to business owners for the sake of caution. Also, they are not lending much for monthly settlements with business owners at the beginning of the month. Business is depressed in Xiaoshan, and there is a lack of circulating funds in the market, which leads to poor turnover. The number of businesses that have declared closure has recently been no less than dozens, which shows that business is declining and difficult to recover at this time.</p>
<h3>Incense Boat Robbed Mid-Route</h3>
<p>At dawn on the 29th, an incense boat that departed from Shaoxing to Xiaoshan Yuemiao was traveling through Zunyi Bridge when it was suddenly stopped by seven or eight bandits on the shore. They boarded the boat and searched it thoroughly. All thirty-five male and female pilgrims, young and old, were searched one by one. Finding no large amounts of silver dollars, they stripped all the pilgrims of their clothes, resulting in a total loss of more than 200 yuan.</p>

<h3>14th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government: Celebratory Meeting Held by All Sectors Yesterday; Flags Flown Throughout the City to Mark the Occasion</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. At 9:00 AM, the Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from all sectors of the city to hold a celebratory meeting in the Great Auditorium. The meeting was chaired by Xing Wan, chairman of the Municipal Committee. Over a hundred representatives attended. All agencies, schools, and organizations flew flags to mark the occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Xing Wan, chairman of the Municipal Committee; Du Mengsen, recorder; Zhang Hanyun, master of ceremonies; Hu Xiongding from Jiaotong University; Lin Kecong from Shanghai Women's Association; Mao Yun from Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union; Zhang Lichun from Shanghai Education Association; Gao Minghe from Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court; Yu Yaoqiu from Baoshan Fellow Townsmen Association; Qin Haibi from South Goods Industry Trade Union; Jiang Shouchun from Tongji University; Chen Boyan from Second Special District Local Court; Gao Jie and Dong Chongshan from Second Branch of Jiangsu Higher Court; Wang Zongjian from Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office; Zhu Shide from China National Goods Maintenance Association; Ren Bin from Toothbone Utensil Trade Union; Hu Tianseng from New Movement Promotion Association; and representatives from Jie Ru, Huiqiao, Jingye, and other schools, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Xing Wan reported, stating, "Today is the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, and it is also the day our Party's Premier assumed the position of Extraordinary Grand President. As we reflect on the past and look to the future, we are reminded that the Premier devoted his life to revolution, seeking national equality, the establishment of civil rights, and the development of people's livelihood. In short, he wanted to save China through revolution. The Premier's revolution failed more than ten times, but he did not lose heart. He sacrificed many revolutionary martyrs in the midst of hardship, creating the Republic of China. After the Republic of China was established, not only did those in power fail to cherish it, but they also failed to follow the Premier's revolutionary principles and strategies. Therefore, the Premier relinquished the presidency to Yuan Shikai. All of Yuan's reactionary actions were due to a failure to recognize talent, resulting in the various disputes after the establishment of the Republic of China. But the Premier still rallied many revolutionary comrades, and although Yuan fell, the emergence of the military governors and Zhang Xun's restoration further devastated the Republic. Later, warlords successively seized power, causing the Republic to suffer even more. At this time, the Republic was in grave danger, and every warlord had an imperialist power backing them. Amidst the internal and external attacks of revolutionary forces, the Premier had no choice but to assume the position of Extraordinary Grand President in order to concentrate revolutionary forces and promote revolutionary principles. There are two points we should recognize in these years: (1) After the establishment of the Republic of China, feudal forces continued to collude with imperialists to undermine revolutionary forces because comrades at the time lacked unwavering faith. We see that the current situation is that reactionary forces are still trying to make a comeback. We must adhere to the Premier's spirit and strive to save China and seek peace. (2) Life is a combination of spirit and matter, and the country also has a life structure. Western countries only know how to value material development, so Western morality has declined. Therefore, the occurrence of a second world war in the future will certainly be the result of their emphasis on matter. Historically, China has only focused on spirit, so we Chinese not only seek to save China spiritually, but also demand material construction. Recently, Chairman Chiang has advocated two movements: (1) the New Life Movement and (2) the National Economic Construction Movement. The former is about spirit, and the latter is about matter. Only by advancing in both spirit and matter can China find a true way out."</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans: (1) All compatriots unite as one! (2) Inherit the Premier's fearless spirit! (3) Eliminate the remnants of the bandits! (4) Eradicate corruption and depravity! (5) Strive for production and construction! (6) Complete local autonomy! (7) Long live the Three People's Principles! (8) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! (9) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Railroad Party Headquarters: At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Railroad Party Headquarters held a commemorative meeting for the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government in the Great Auditorium. All staff of the headquarters and representatives from the Railway Bureau, the Railway Trade Union Office, and the vocational teachers of various Rotary Primary Schools, totaling over a hundred people, attended the meeting. After performing the prescribed rituals, Chairman Li Dasan reported on the significance of commemorating the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, stating that the Premier, seeing the deteriorating state of the nation and the intertwined internal and external troubles, resolutely went to Guangzhou fourteen years ago to assume the post of Extraordinary Grand President and establish the Revolutionary Government to engage in the National Revolution. His spirit of acting righteously and not shirking responsibility is worthy of our admiration and respect. In this time of national crisis, the perilousness of the environment is even greater than it was fourteen years ago. We should emulate the Premier's revolutionary spirit, work hard to overcome the national crisis, engage in production and construction, and fulfill the Premier's legacy. Subsequently, Fan Shouzhi, a representative of the Railway Bureau, Chen Pin, a fighter from the Railroad Party Headquarters, and Li Guohua, a representative from the First Affiliated District Party Headquarters, delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned after shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Seafarers' Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Seafarers' Party Headquarters held a commemorative meeting for the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government in the Great Auditorium of the headquarters. All committee members, staff, responsible persons from various district party headquarters across the country, and representatives from various seafarers' organizations, totaling over two hundred people, attended the meeting. Chairman Chen chaired the meeting, with Wang Rui as the recorder and Zhu Guangyu as the master of ceremonies. After performing the prescribed rituals, Chairman Chen reported, dividing his report into six points: (1) The Premier's assumption of the position of Extraordinary Grand President was the foundation for the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. (2) The tyranny of the Northern Warlords before the tenth year of the Republic and their division of territories and the general situation of wars. (3) The absurdity of Cao Kun's bribery election, Wu Peifu's military unification, and the United Provinces Autonomy Peace Conference. (4) The Premier's revolutionary spirit in protecting the Constitution and going south to assume the position of Extraordinary Grand President. (5) To commemorate the "May Fifth Movement", we must inherit the Premier's legacy and strive to complete the revolutionary work. (6) We must assist the government in suppressing the Red bandits, reviving the countryside, and strengthening national defense. A letter to the seafarers was also printed and distributed. The meeting adjourned after shouting slogans at approximately 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Zeng Zhongming Received the Press Yesterday and Delivered a Speech on Railway Construction and Debt Consolidation. Dr. Henry Munde Accepted an Invitation to China to Undertake a Mission.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Jiaer Street at 5:00 PM yesterday and delivered a written speech, stating that the public has been paying close attention to the Ministry's railway construction and debt consolidation. During his previous visit to Shanghai, he briefly answered some questions, but due to the hurried nature of the conversation, he was unable to provide detailed explanations. Now that everyone has inquired about these two matters again, he will provide a summary as follows:</p>
<p>Railways Completed Under Construction: The work of the Ministry of Railways in the past three years can be divided into several categories: (A) Railways and other projects completed under construction: (1) The Shaozhou-Lechang section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The entire line is 1,092 kilometers long. The southern section from Guangzhou to Shaozhou and the northern section from Wuchang to Zhuzhou were completed and opened to traffic long ago. The middle section is under active construction. The Lechang section, which is 50 kilometers long, was completed and opened to traffic the year before last. (2) The western end of the Hai Railway extends from Lingbao to Xi'an. It was completed and opened to traffic in December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), with a total length of 202 kilometers. The eastern end extends to Lanyao Lianyungang, with a total length of 28 kilometers, and can now reach the seaport. In addition, a branch line from Zhaodun Station to Tai'erzhuang was built in the middle section, with a total length of 31 kilometers. (3) The Zhengtai Railway built a branch line from Yuci to Taigu, with a total length of 35 kilometers, which was opened to traffic in December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). (4) The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was built by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and completed and opened to traffic at the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), with a total length of 335 kilometers. (5) The Nanjing-Wuhu and Wuhu-Sunjiabu sections are part of the Jingyue Line, built by the Jiangnan Railway Company. They are now open to traffic and are planning to connect with the Jinghu Railway for through transport. The Ministry of Railways has decided to build a central station on the Jinghu Railway. (6) The Capital Ferry was completed in October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) at a total cost of 3.8 million yuan, allowing for through transport on the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways, making travel more convenient.</p>
<p>Railways Still Under Construction: (B) Railways and other projects currently under construction: (1) The Zhuzhou-Lechang section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. This section is 406 kilometers long and is estimated to require more than 62 million yuan. It is expected to be completed and opened to traffic by the end of next year. (2) The Yuping Line, the Yushan-Nanchang section, is 300 kilometers long and requires approximately 16 million yuan. The project is managed locally by the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces and supervised by the Ministry of Railways. (3) The Suzhou-Jiaxing section is 73 kilometers long. Once completed, the journey from Beijing to Hangzhou will be shortened by 110 kilometers. (4) Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. This railway includes the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which is jointly funded by the Ministry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The section from the Qiantang River to the Cao'e River is 78 kilometers long and is under active construction.</p>
<p>New Equipment for Various Railways: (C) New equipment added to various state-owned railways in recent years, excluding materials purchased by the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, includes 59 locomotives, 775 freight cars, and 24 passenger cars.</p>
<p>Various Lines Under Survey: (D) Lines under planning for construction and survey: (1) The Xilan Line, from Xi'an to Lanzhou, is approximately 700 kilometers long. It is currently planned to be built in sections. The Xi'an-Xianyang section, which is 21 kilometers long, is under construction. The Xianyang-Baoji section, which is approximately 160 kilometers long, is under construction. The Baoji-Lanzhou section will continue to be surveyed by air within a few months. (2) The Baoji-Chengdu section is planning to implement aerial surveying. In addition, surveying teams have been organized and dispatched to survey the Nanchang-Yushan section and the Xiangchuan section.</p>
<p>Debt Consolidation Work: The Ministry needs capital for the planning, construction, and consolidation of various railways. If we want various Chinese and foreign syndicates to invest, we must first consolidate Chinese and foreign debts. The Ministry has been working hard on this work for the past three years and has gradually achieved results. Taking railway bonds as an example, their market prices have been increasing month by month in foreign countries. A comparison table will make this clear.</p>
<p>Mission of Mr. Henry Munde: In addition to delivering a written speech, Mr. Zeng also answered reporters' questions, saying that Mr. Henry Munde, a British railway authority, has been invited by our government this time and is being hosted by the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Economic Council. His term is four months. After Mr. Munde arrived in Shanghai, he met with me for quite some time. This is his first visit to China, and he has a great deal of research on the railway system. He is scheduled to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and National Economic Council Standing Committee member Song Ziwen on the 6th. He will stay in Shanghai for three or four days before going to Beijing. After staying in Beijing for a few days, he will go to various railways across the country for inspection. The Ministry of Railways has decided to send Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, to accompany him. It is said that the Economic Council will also send two members to accompany him. Mr. Munde is scheduled to inspect in May and June and compile a report in July and August. His scope of inspection will include not only the railway system but also railway management, etc., which will be examined in detail.</p>
<p>Railway Transportation Conference: The Ministry of Railways, in order to improve the transportation of various railways across the country, will convene a National Railway Transportation Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 16th of this month. Directors and heads of transportation departments of various railway bureaus will attend. It is also learned that the Ministry of Railways has appointed Yang Xianfen, Tan Yaozong, and six other people to attend as representatives, and Yuan Shaochang, Ma Tingxie, and 36 other people to attend the meeting.

<h3>British Railway Expert Henry Munde Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

He is scheduled to take a train to Beijing on the 7th to meet with our government authorities to discuss the inspection schedule and then depart to inspect various railways. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday After Accepting Invitation: After Mr. Henry Munde signed the contract of employment with representatives of our government in London, he and his assistant secretary, Leon Taylor, boarded the British ship "Lampaura" and left England for China. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Xu Jianping, the National Economic Council, and the Ministry of Railways, Zheng Baozhao, Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director of the Two Railways, Li Yushu, Director of Foreign Affairs, Cao Shengzhi, Deputy Director of Transportation, and George, British Commercial Consul, all went to greet him. Mr. Munde and the welcoming officials exchanged greetings and then disembarked. Accompanied by Zheng Baozhao, he took a car to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road to rest. Mr. Munde is 54 years old and is a leading authority on British railways. He participated in the European War and served as a brigadier general.

<p>Visited Yesterday to Discuss Inspection Schedule: Mr. Munde's visit to China is his first time, and he is not very familiar with the situation in China.

Mr. Zeng suggested that Mr. Munde depart to inspect various railways in May and June, and return to Beijing in July and August to compile a report, which would be more suitable for China's climate. The two sides talked for a long time, and Mr. Munde returned to his hotel at about 4:00 PM to rest.

<h3>Art Exhibition: The Preview Closed Last Night</h3>
<p>Exhibition for Four Weeks, Audience of 50,000 to 60,000 People. Packing Begins Tomorrow, Shipping to England on August 8th.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art opened at the old site of the Bank of China on the Bund on the 8th of last month, it has been well received by Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai due to its pioneering nature. A total of 50,000 to 60,000 people visited the exhibition in 28 days, which can be said to be a great success. The exhibition will be closed from today, and the packing and shipping of antiques to England will begin immediately. The British warship "Suffolk," specially dispatched to China to transport antiques, went to Japan a few days ago and will load the antiques in Shanghai on August 8th and transport them to England. The Central News Agency reporter has compiled the various details obtained yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Closed Last Night: The Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art closed last night (the 5th). Yesterday was Sunday and also the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government, and the number of visitors was extremely crowded, creating an unprecedented scene. The total number of visitors was about 3,000.</p>
<p>No Ceremony: No ceremony was held when the preview opened on April 8th, so the closing last night was the same as usual, with no ceremony held. However, from tomorrow, the exhibition will be closed, and the gate facing the Bund will be locked. Staff will enter and exit through the back door on Renji Road.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Visitors: The preview officially opened on the morning of April 8th and officially closed last night, lasting for four weeks. During these four weeks, the daily number of visitors varied depending on the weather, but on average, it was always around 2,000 people, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 people. These 50,000 to 60,000 people came from all countries, showing that the interest in appreciating antiques is not limited to nationality. Our Chinese culture is extremely superior and developed thousands of years earlier than Europe and the West. Eastern culture also evolved from Chinese culture. Therefore, our Chinese culture has an indelible value. The preview displayed antiques in twelve major categories. Although the number was only more than 900 pieces, it cannot be said to be many. However, after strict selection by the Chinese expert committee and the British committee, the essence was extracted, which is enough to represent a part. Moreover, the display is systematic, which is unique here. Therefore, the audience, both Chinese and foreign, expressed satisfaction, believing that the preview has important significance in any aspect of culture, education, and art.</p>
<p>Visiting Groups: Yesterday was the last day of the preview, and there were also many visiting groups, including the Guangdong Inspection Group, Wushi Commercial English School, Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Shanghai Jingwu Sports Association, Shanghai Haiyun Art and Literature Society, Shanghai Chinese Club of the Municipal Council, Shanghai Women's School, Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences, Department of Bacteriology, Society for Printing Song Dynasty Editions, Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Hangzhou YMCA, Shenchang Chinese United Welfare Association, Ant Society, Central Bank, Zhengyi Society, and others.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Arrived: Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education, arrived in Shanghai by night express from Beijing yesterday morning because the preview closed last night. He came to preside over the event. Vice Minister Duan is a standing committee member of the preparatory committee of the exhibition and is very enthusiastic about the affairs of the exhibition. After arriving at the meeting yesterday morning, he inspected the venue for a week. Gu Shusen, the executive secretary of the exhibition, accompanied him. After Mr. Duan's inspection, he was very satisfied. Mr. Duan took a car back to Beijing that evening after the exhibition closed.</p>
<p>Weekly Special Issue: The China Critic, an English weekly run by Chinese people, published a special issue because the preview was of great significance, publishing articles related to the preview. This special issue has been published and is priced at 20 cents.</p>
<p>Cai and Zeng Visited: Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, and his wife, and Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, and his wife, also visited the exhibition yesterday. Mr. Cai was very interested in antiques and has visited the exhibition many times.</p>
<p>Packing Begins: After the preview closed, the unfinished matters will be continued by the Shanghai Office of the Preparatory Committee of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. The reception staff transferred by the Ministry of Education will return to the Ministry today (the 6th) because the preview has closed. Other custodians must wait until the packing is completed before they can return to Beijing. The antiques will be packed from tomorrow and are scheduled to be completed by the 10th. Zhuang Shangyan and others from the Palace Museum will also accompany the counting and sealing. After packing, a list will be prepared and reported to the competent authorities for record. After the 10th, only a few important staff members of the exhibition will be left at the office to take care of it. At the same time, customs clearance procedures will be handled with the Ministry of Finance. Once Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese special commissioner, arrives in Shanghai, the antiques will be transported to the British warship and depart for England on August 8th. They are scheduled to be transported back to China in March next year, when they will be publicly exhibited again in the capital.</p>
<p>Various Feelings: This preview of our country's antiques in Shanghai is an unprecedented event, and its impact on the future culture of our country is extremely profound. People from all walks of life are paying close attention. In recent days, various Chinese and foreign newspapers have published the feelings of visitors, such as Ye Gongchuo, Wu Hufan, Cao Juren, Xue Quanzeng, Lin Yutang, Wang Guoxiu, Xue Jiawen, Min Bao Hu Puan, Shuang Jun, Chen Bao Fei Jun, Teng Gu, Chan Yin Daoren, Tuo, Yan Duhe, Lao Can, Shi Chongpeng, M. M. Pardoe, Haroiet, B. Lacy, ProBono Pnblico, R. L. Hobson Wm. Yinoon, Lee Florence Ayscongh, Wen Yuan-ming, Anne K. Sun, etc., have all published their feelings. Most said that this kind of preview is of great value and can truly serve as proof of the superiority of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Statistics of Antiques: Although the number of antiques in this preview has been recorded in various newspapers from time to time, the exhibition has continued to receive more than 100 additional exhibits since the start of the exhibition, which have not been included. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the exhibition that the total number of antiques in this preview, large and small, is 955 pieces. 735 pieces were selected and sent by the Palace Museum, accounting for about 77%. 111 pieces were selected and sent by the Academia Sinica, accounting for about 12%. 50 pieces were selected and sent by the National Peking Library, accounting for about 5%. 47 pieces were selected and sent by the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall, accounting for about 4.8%. 8 pieces were selected and sent by the Henan Provincial Museum, accounting for about 0.8%. 4 pieces were selected and sent by the Anhui Provincial Library, accounting for about 0.4%.</p>
<p>Tang's Talk: A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Tang Xifen, the secretary of the exhibition, yesterday. He expressed his joy at the successful conclusion of the exhibition, and said that the relatively satisfactory result was due to the cooperation of the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Bank of China, and various sectors. He should also deeply thank the authorities on behalf of the exhibition. Our country has collected the crystallization of cultural arts of various generations and made them public for exhibition. This exhibition is its beginning. Fortunately, after several months of operation, it was finally able to invite people from all walks of life in the largest city in the country and international people to browse. Unfortunately, the exhibition period was only one month due to various reasons, even though all sectors requested an extension of five days. Moreover, the first few days were slightly affected by bad weather. However, in more than 20 days, the number of visitors reached about 50,000 to 60,000 people, and many of them made criticisms. Although there were mixed reviews, the authorities of the exhibition did adopt them in depth, either immediately improving them or leaving them for future exhibitions as a reference. Therefore, they also expressed deep gratitude to those who came to the exhibition and made corrections. From tomorrow (the 6th), the exhibition will be closed, and various antique packing and other work will be carried out. The British warship "Suffolk," specially dispatched, will be entrusted to depart for England on the 8th of next month. After eight months of exhibition in London, it will be transferred back to China, when it will be publicly exhibited again in the capital.</p>
<h3>Three Banks and Silver and Money Industries to Discuss Loans Today</h3>
<p>It is decided to first handle credit loans of 5 million yuan. The Shanghai money market has gradually loosened and the foreign exchange rate has fallen.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Banking Association, the Money Dealers Association, and other institutions are scheduled to meet at 2:00 PM today to discuss industrial and commercial relief loans of 20 million yuan in Shanghai and mortgage guarantee loans of 15 million yuan. It is decided that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China will be responsible for these loans respectively. Of the 5 million yuan in credit guarantee loans, the member banks of the Banking Association have already confirmed 1,885,000 yuan, and the member money shops of the Money Dealers Association have confirmed 250,000 yuan. The remaining 2,865,000 yuan will be borne by the Central Bank and other banks.</p>
<p>First Handle Credit: A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that although both mortgage guarantee loans and credit guarantee loans are hoped to be implemented as soon as possible by industry and commerce, credit guarantee loans are the most important. This is because it is easier for national goods factories to borrow money by mortgaging their original boxed goods to the silver and money industries. If the stores selling national goods have to place their goods in the kitchen windows and sell them every day, then credit guarantee loans are necessary. Therefore, it has now been decided to handle the 5 million yuan in credit guarantee loans first.</p>
<p>Money Market Gradually Loosens: After the end of April for industry and commerce, the foreign exchange rate in the money market was 12 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets yesterday, a decrease of 2 cents compared with the previous day and a decrease of 8 cents compared with the end of April, which proves that the Shanghai money market has gradually loosened. However, it is expected that when spring cocoons are launched in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the demand for funds will be more frequent, so the foreign exchange rate will inevitably rise again. This is a phenomenon that occurs every year.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Inspection Group Visited This Newspaper Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Hosted by Ma Yinliang and others</p>
<p>The first group of the Guangdong Provincial Government sent to inspect administration in various provinces across the country, including Li Getian, Li Yupei, Wen Kecheng, Song Dejian, Zhong Shenglin, Lin Zhanjin, Zhang Jinqun, Deng Runkang, He Zhongchun, Zeng Guoguang, Chen Zonghai, and eleven others, visited the printing and typesetting and other work of this newspaper at 6:00 AM yesterday. Ma Yinliang, manager of this newspaper, and Gu Shuqi and Huang Qing, hosted them, and guided them to the various departments to explain the details for about two hours before ending. They then went to the fifth floor for tea and photos to commemorate the event. At 9:00 AM, they went to the Bank of China on the Bund to visit the China Preview of the London Art Exhibition. Mr. Yang Dezhao had previously contacted the exhibition authorities and accompanied them on the visit. At noon, they attended a private banquet at the residence of Mayor Wu Haizhou, hosted by Secretary Yu Jun and Section Chief Li Dachao, and invited Chen Shuren, a member of the Central Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Zhang Huichang, the newly appointed minister to Zhanba, and Yang Dezhao to accompany them. The guests and hosts parted happily at 2:00 PM. The group then went to Zhaofeng Garden for a tour. This morning, they visited the Commercial Press, the Maya Silk Weaving Factory, and the Gongxuetuan run by Tao Xingzhi, and inspected the recent situation of the promotion of the Little Teacher system. Lin Baisheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan, and Tang Liangli, a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, plan to hold a banquet at Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 6:00 PM tonight and invite the general managers and editors of various newspapers in the city to gather together to strengthen contacts. Whether the group will leave Shanghai on the same day will be decided at the group's meeting tonight before it can be carried out.</p>

<h3>Sixth Day of Literacy Promotion Week: Today is School Promotion Day</h3>
<p>Schools Dispatch Students to Form Propaganda Teams to Promote Literacy Education. The Municipal Education Association Issues a Letter to the Education Sector on the Literacy Movement. Director Tao Delivers a Speech on Recruiting Teachers.</p>
<p>Today is the sixth day of the Literacy Movement Promotion in this city, School Promotion Day. Students from all schools in the city will participate in promoting literacy education. The Municipal Education Association has issued a letter to the education sector to promote literacy education. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Movie Propaganda: Yesterday, the fifth day, was Movie Propaganda Day. In addition to all the cinemas in the city adding screenings of literacy education slides, movie propaganda rallies were held in the Gonghe and Zhabei theaters in Nanshi. Lu Haishan, an official of the association, presided over the Gonghe Theater, gave a speech on the intention of literacy education, and the procedures for literacy schools, and screened the Golden Age produced by Yihua. Lu Renjie presided over the World Theater, and also gave a speech on the importance of purchasing literacy education and screened the Women's Morality film produced by Mingxing. Both theaters were full.</p>
<p>School Promotion: Recently, on School Promotion Day, which happened to be a Monday, the principals of various schools gave speeches on the meaning of literacy education during the memorial week, and students were selectively dispatched to form propaganda teams to give speeches outside the school. When the students returned home, they distributed brochures and leaflets to the illiterate people in the vicinity to encourage them to read. The Municipal Education Association also issued a letter to the entire education sector to promote literacy education.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan Talks: A reporter from Shangxin News Agency met Tao Baichuan, Director-General of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee, yesterday and talked about the committee's recruitment of teachers for literacy schools. The questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Reporter asked) It is thought that there are many recent applicants for the literacy school teachers; (Answer) To date, there have been a total of more than 340 people. Compared with the number of 200 people planned to be recruited by this association, it can be said that it is not very enthusiastic. (Question) Why is this? Is it because the registration office is too far away? (Answer) The reason is inexplicable. The registration office is now located in the city center, and the transportation is very convenient. The round-trip fare from the North Railway Station to public transport is only 40 cents. This association now has a registration office in the Nanshi Wenming Road Public Education Hall, but the number of people is not increasing. (Question) Is it because the need to test phonetic symbols makes people hesitant? (Answer) Very few people have learned phonetic symbols. What is easy for everyone is difficult for everyone, and there is not much impact on the possibility of admission. Moreover, this association still needs to train on this. (Question) What will the salary of the teachers be in the future? (Answer) It depends on the number of classes they teach. Teaching six classes a day will result in a monthly salary of 40 yuan, but at least 20 yuan can be given. The treatment is not very bad. (What is the period? (Answer) About one year. (Question) Is part-time work allowed? (Answer) Part-time work is not allowed. (Question) If the number of people admitted is not enough, what will happen? (Answer) It is planned to recruit again in the future, and we will never collect fees indiscriminately. We will completely adopt the principle of talent. (Question) What is the meaning of the principle of talent? (Answer) First, there must be a sound physique. Second, there must be a spirit of labor service. Third, there must be a considerable amount of rich common sense. Fourth, there must be a considerable amount of quick eloquence.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese United Association Actively Seeks to Unite Overseas Compatriots</h3>
<p>Sends Bai Hongji to Nanyang Tomorrow to Solicit Members; Sends Letters to Chambers of Commerce in Various Regions Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association, following the order of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, has begun reorganization. To develop the association's affairs and unite overseas compatriots, Executive Committee member Mr. Bai Hongji has been specially appointed to carry official letters and travel to various parts of Nanyang tomorrow to solicit members. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sending a Representative Overseas to Solicit Members The association's Executive Committee member, Mr. Bai Hongji, is scheduled to depart tomorrow on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover for various parts of Nanyang, carrying official letters, declarations, registration forms, and organizational charters. He will meet with the persons in charge of various Chinese Chambers of Commerce, requesting them to assist in soliciting new members. It is reported that the association's committee members are scheduled to hold a farewell banquet for Mr. Bai at the German Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at approximately 6:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Sending Letters to Chambers of Commerce in Various Overseas Regions The association has sent letters to the responsible persons of Chinese General Chambers of Commerce in the American Philippines, British Malaya, Dutch Java, Borneo, Sumatra, French Vietnam, the Americas, Australia, Siam, and other places, requesting their assistance. The letter states: "We respectfully report that we are deeply grateful for your enthusiastic assistance in past endeavors of our association. During this period of reorganization, we rely especially on the enthusiastic registration of all members, so that future elections may gather talent effectively. We are taking advantage of Mr. Bai Hongji's trip to Nanyang to send him to your Chinese Chamber of Commerce with declarations, registration forms, registration regulations, and membership lists, requesting you to distribute them to all members and to have the completed registration forms sent directly to our association for compilation and periodic re-election. This matter concerns the self-interest of overseas compatriots, and we hope that you will provide your utmost support and achieve perfection. We also hope to receive a reply."</p>
<p>Publishing a Declaration from the Reorganization Committee The association's declaration states: "Since its establishment in the first year of the Republic of China, the Overseas Chinese United Association has had chairmen and presidents who were all advanced figures in the Party and renowned elders in the overseas Chinese community. They have all been committed to reorganization, both spiritually and materially. Thanks to this, the association's affairs have been maintained without decline for many years. We recall that when the Party's army launched the Northern Expedition to unify the Central Plains, and military operations ended to begin political tutelage, the sole mission of this association was to unite overseas compatriots to develop domestic industries, thereby increasing national strength. However, the trend of economic recession coincided with that time, and its impact was such that the industries painstakingly established by our overseas compatriots were nearly all overturned and collapsed, a sight rarely seen in history. Those who were able to struggle on felt exhausted and had no time to consider domestic construction. Moreover, with the rampant communists in Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, and other provinces, war was frequent. Even the few overseas Chinese who could afford to invest in the country were hesitant due to the unsettled local order. This is a fact that is clearly evident and cannot be concealed. The past is gone. Now, in this autumn of severe national crisis, looking around the globe, the clouds of East Asia are tightening daily, and the crisis in Western Europe is fraught with danger. A future war may not be far off. The entire nation, from top to bottom, is rising up and striving to catch up, fearing that once war breaks out, we will have no way to defend ourselves. How can we hesitate and wait and miss the opportunity? Our overseas compatriots, with their foresight, will certainly follow their past enthusiasm for supporting the revolution, unite together, and advance towards the path of national salvation. This is the first thing that this association expects of overseas compatriots. There are many ways to save the country, but the key is to strengthen national power. The communists who have occupied Fujian and Jiangxi for many years have been repeatedly besieged by the Central Army and have already collapsed. The remaining dregs have fled far to Sichuan and are now surrounded by the army. It will not be difficult to annihilate them like fish in a pot. However, the newly recovered bandit areas have suffered severe damage, and although the government is comforting and resettling refugees, it will not be possible to restore the original situation in a short period of time. This matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished without collective efforts. If private individuals raise funds to establish productive industries and crafts, so that the people in the bandit areas do not lose their jobs, then the restoration of the countryside can be expected within a short period of time. This is the second thing that this association expects of overseas compatriots. In recent years, our country's industry and commerce have plummeted, and shops and factories have closed down one after another. Last year, due to international competition, other countries raised the price of silver, and a large amount of our country's cash flowed abroad. Shanghai and other ports experienced financial panic, and all industries were in imminent danger. Although the government is trying to maintain the situation, if there are no fundamental remedies, the danger will be even more difficult to describe. The survival of the nation hangs by a thread. How should our overseas compatriots cooperate with domestic industry and commerce to try to save the crisis? This is the third thing that this association expects of overseas compatriots. The above are all major points. Overseas compatriots are far away in foreign lands and only know the superficial aspects of the domestic situation. Even domestic industry and commerce do not know much about the situation of overseas Chinese. How, then, can we unite the people at home and abroad, unite as one, and save ourselves and the country? The Overseas Chinese United Association is the hub of overseas Chinese around the world, so the responsibilities of the Overseas Chinese United Association in the future are even greater than before. The reorganization period is not long. Those in charge of it are like building a bridge. Once the bridge is completed, vehicles and horses can still travel from this shore directly to the other shore and drive on the road. In other words, once the reorganization is complete, officials will be re-elected to add new life to the association. It is hoped that overseas compatriots will take responsibility together. The Party and the country are fortunate, and the overseas Chinese are fortunate."</p>

<p>The number of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan and arriving in Shanghai has reached more than five hundred. It is now learned that the fifty-third batch of expelled overseas Chinese, Wu Dajie (from Fujian) and three others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Yokohama and other places on the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Maya Maru. They stayed at the Hongkou Public and Commercial Inn, and their situation was quite miserable.

<h3>Publicity: Key Points for Soliciting Funds for Aviation to Save the Country</h3>
<p>The Office of the General Captain of the Aviation Association Sends a Letter to the Education Bureau, Instructing Broadcasting Stations and Entertainment Venues to Broadcast Official Publicity Programs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association began solicitation work more than two months ago. The team leaders have been working very hard, and the people of various regions and this city have been enthusiastically supporting them, with excellent results. The office believes that this matter is of great importance and relies on collective efforts. In particular, it is necessary to conduct widespread publicity to arouse public attention and encourage generous donations. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau, instructing all broadcasting stations, storytelling venues, and entertainment venues in the city to broadcast publicity programs for the aviation salvation movement on a regular basis, and formulated several concise publicity points for the solicitation movement. The details are listed on the left: The Chinese Aviation Association's Shanghai Municipal Second Solicitation and Fundraising Aviation Salvation Movement hopes that all sectors of the city and citizens will join as members and donate as much as possible to the aviation salvation fund. (1) Organize 500 solicitation teams throughout the city, recruit 100,000 new members, and raise 1 million yuan for the aviation salvation fund. (2) The scope of solicitation includes families, shops, companies, banks, money houses, factories, schools, organizations, personnel and their families, relatives, friends, men, women, old, young, workers, etc. (3) Membership is divided into ordinary (annual membership fee of 2 yuan), special (annual membership fee of 10 yuan), supporting (annual membership fee of 50 yuan), permanent (membership fee of 500 yuan or more), and group (annual membership fee of 50 yuan or more). (4) Donations for aviation salvation, regardless of the amount, can be paid to the Xianqiao Youth Association, the Chinese Aviation Association's Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Headquarters, or various banks. Zhang, captain of the 330th team, requested that Gu Qingwei, Lu Baozhen, Jin Yizong, Zhi Lin, Zhang Jingchao, Zhu Chengzi, Liu Yongsi, Wang Cai, Wang Zongliang, Wang Xian, Xu Renzhi, Min Liang, and Zhu Jiliang, a total of 26 people, be additionally appointed as deputy captains of the team. Zi Xing, captain of the 182nd team, requested that Zhuang Zhisun be reappointed as deputy captain and that 500 more badges be issued. It is reported that the headquarters of the general team has already sent letters of appointment and badges to them separately.</p>

<p>Chadley, the foreign chief engineer of the Dredging Bureau, designed the dredging of the Shentan shoals at the mouth of the Yangtze River and ordered the construction of the giant automatic dredger Jianshe from the German Xuegao Iron Shipyard. After arriving in Shanghai, it was handed over to the Jiangnan Shipyard for dismantling and inspection, and it is said that everyone was satisfied. All dredging of Shentan will begin as soon as the test run is completed. It is reported that Chief Engineer Chadley has requested leave from Director Song to return to England for his five-year regular leave, which will take about half a year, and is expected to return to Shanghai at the end of October this year. It is reported that the duties of chief engineer left behind have been delegated to Chinese Deputy Engineer Xue Zhuobin.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Moves to New Location for Office</h3>
<p>New Location is Large, Clean, and Beautiful; Detention Center Installed with New Equipment</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau moved to its new location at 171 Penglai Road yesterday and is scheduled to officially begin operating at the new location today. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the New Location</p>
<p>The new bureau site has been completely renovated and looks brand new. The horizontal plaque with the six characters "Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau" at the front gate was written by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The walls are made of red brick, clean and beautiful. The central hall upstairs is the director's office, secretary's office, and director's reception room, and downstairs are the offices of the first and second sections.</p>
<p>Elevated Corridor</p>
<p>There are two floors each in the east and west wings. Except for a small part of the lower floor of the west end, which is used as an auditorium, the rest are the supervisory office and the offices of various divisions. Both ends of the east and west wings have elevated corridors that connect to the central hall. The small hall at the end of the lawn in the rear section is entirely for the various divisions of the third section and interrogation rooms. To the west are the detention center, the detective team, and the police dormitory, garage, etc.</p>
<p>New Style Detention Center</p>
<p>The detention center building is very modern, with two floors. There are seven prison cells on the upper floor and eight cells on the lower floor. Each cell is equipped with a Western-style flush toilet and bright iron-barred glass windows that can be opened to allow air circulation. Each cell is equipped with an electric light, and the interior is decorated cleanly. The architectural style of the other wardens' rooms is also commendable.</p>
<p>Police Team Enters</p>
<p>Since the relocation began the day before yesterday, most of it was completed by noon yesterday. The police first detachment stationed at the old bureau on Jingtian Road also marched into the new site in formation at 8:00 AM yesterday. Director Cai Jingjun personally inspected the bureau once the night before last. Yesterday, because of the busy arrangements, Hong, the chief of the second section, and Tan, the chief of the supervisory office, arrived at the bureau early in the morning.</p>
<p>Office Today</p>
<p>Detainees held in the old bureau's detention center were escorted by the third section to the new bureau's detention center for detention yesterday afternoon. A small number of remaining police officers were also withdrawn in the afternoon. The sections and divisions are scheduled to begin working at the new location at 8:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Promoting the New Movement</p>
<p>Since Director Cai Jingjun took office, he has vigorously reorganized the work inside and outside the bureau. He has paid special attention to the promotion of the New Life Movement. He can do everything in the spirit of leading by example in the army. The Public Security Bureau's office hours have been from 8:00 AM, but a few of the staff above the section level often did not arrive until 11:00 AM. Since Director Cai came, he has vigorously eliminated this drawback. Several people have been dismissed for being late or leaving early, so the atmosphere has changed. Although work still starts at 8:00 AM, the attendance books of each section and office are already full of stamps at 7:30 AM. It is reported that the bureau moved to the new bureau (the old site of Shanghai County) on the 5th of this month. In order to further promote the New Life Movement, Director Cai formulated ten measures for the first phase of the New Life Movement for Public Security Bureau staff. The most important of these is that all staff members practice military exercises for half an hour every morning from 8:00 AM. All male staff members must wear uniforms or Zhongshan suits and are prohibited from wearing long gowns. Female staff members must wear blue cloth uniforms and are not allowed to perm their hair or wear rouge. Smoking cigarettes is not allowed in the office. It is reported that orders have been issued to all sections and offices to implement this when moving into the new Shanghai County Bureau. It is expected that the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau will have a new look from now on.</p>
<h3>The Pathological State of Society: Why are There So Many Suicides? What Can't Be Done, Why Commit Suicide? Efforts Should be Made to Eliminate the Trend of Suicide</h3>
<p>Lü Yuqing</p>
<p>At the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Road in the French Concession, a female guest arrived at around 11:00 PM the night before last. She was wearing a blue silk cheongsam, had short, fashionable hair, and was a modern woman. She claimed to be Lü Yuqing, 28 years old, from Guangdong. The waiter led her upstairs and opened room 204. Unexpectedly, that night the woman secretly swallowed sleeping pills in the room and committed suicide. When the waiter discovered her at 6:20 AM at dawn, the woman was unable to speak. She was immediately hired a car to the Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 12:40 PM at noon.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhisheng</p>
<p>A traveler named Yuan Zhisheng, a local, 40 years old, committed suicide by poisoning in room 318 on the third floor of the Dahua Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road at 12:20 PM yesterday. The waiter discovered it immediately and reported it to the cashier. An ambulance was called and he was taken to the hospital for treatment, but he died soon after arriving at the hospital due to severe poisoning.</p>
<p>Wang Mao</p>
<p>Wang Mao, from Hubei, 21 years old, rented a house at 60 Disiwei Road, Jiangkou. He graduated from Fudan University in Jiangwan. However, Wang stayed at the No. 423 dormitory of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA in order to avoid the noise and engage in academic studies. Yesterday was Sunday, a school holiday. Because of the lack of freedom in marriage, he was depressed and committed suicide by secretly taking tranquilizer pills at around 10:00 AM. His life was in danger. The waiter in the dormitory discovered it and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Wu Linshi</p>
<p>A female guest named Wu Linshi, from Guangdong, 21 years old, was in room 505 of the Xin Xin Hotel on Nanjing Road. At 5:40 AM yesterday, she suddenly secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. Someone noticed it and immediately reported it to the police station. An ambulance was called to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild, and there was no danger to her life.</p>
<p>Ms. Li</p>
<p>In room 37 of the Shanghai First Taiwan Hotel at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, there was a female guest. The circulating book only listed Ms. Li, 26 years old. At around 12:15 PM yesterday, she suddenly had the thought of being tired of the world and committed suicide by poisoning. The waiter noticed it and tried to open the door, but she was dying. An ambulance was immediately called to Renji Hospital, but she died on the way due to unsuccessful treatment.</p>
<h3>2,000 Cases of Japanese Oil Sold Out; More Will Come in the Future</h3>
<p>The Mobil, Asiatic, and Guanghua companies previously agreed on prices in order to maintain a balanced sales market. Recently, Japan suddenly shipped a large amount of oil to China for dumping, which has attracted the attention of the three companies. According to reporters' inquiries to relevant parties, the first batch of 2,000 cases of Japanese oil has been sold out in Shanghai, named Chenmenpai. Each case is 20 cents cheaper. This is a trial sale. More will come in the future. It is said that their purpose is to seize the market in the China area. Mobil, Asiatic, and Guanghua companies did not pay close attention to it because there were not many goods coming. In the future, the competition between the two parties will inevitably lead to a reduction in prices, but they are unwilling to do so unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>In the Case of Chen Jinlan's Prison Break, Two Guards Appeal, Disagreeing with the Original Trial Verdict</h3>
<p>After Chen Jinlan, a murderer detained in the detention center of the Special No. 2 District Local Court, escaped from prison on December 27 last year, Gao Xiaoxiang, the warden, transferred the internal and external guards of the three shifts to the prosecutor's office for investigation. As a result, it was determined that Fang Yuqi, the internal guard of the three to seven shifts, and Zhou Wenjin, the external guard, were suspected of colluding to facilitate the escape. After trial in the criminal court, Fang was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and Zhou was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Chen was arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court by the judicial police station. The prosecutor and the police department separately filed public prosecutions. According to Chen's confession, he used lead wire to open the internal and external prison doors and escape at 1:00 AM on December 27. Sun Xiong, the current warden and concurrently warden, has transferred Yang Xingcun and Yan Ling, the internal and external guards of the 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM shift, to the prosecutor's office for investigation and questioning based on Chen's confession. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Fang and Zhou, the two guards who were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment due to Chen's escape, disagreed with the original trial verdict and hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The presiding judge of the Higher Court, Xiong, opened an investigation court to interrogate them. First, the appellants Fang and Zhou were brought to court to state the reasons for their appeal against the original verdict. The judge ordered the escaped prisoner Chen Jinlan to be brought to the case. According to his confession, he was detained in the detention center for the murder case. At 1:00 AM on December 27, he opened the door with lead wire and escaped. He did not ask Fang and Zhou to open the door and let him out. The other prisoners in the same cell did not know about it. The rest of his words were the same as those recorded in the previous report. Wu Shao亭, Zhang Asi, and Zhu Quanxing, three prisoners who were detained in the same cell as Chen before, were brought to the case. They all confessed that they did not know about Chen Jinlan's escape and had not heard Chen talk to the guards Fang and others before. Wang Guanghe and Han Haorui, the guards of the 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM shift, were brought to the case. Wang confessed that he handed over the shift to Yang Xingcun. When he was on duty, the doors of each cell were locked. He had no keys on his person. When handing over the shift to Yang, Chen was sitting in room 11 mending clothes. The prisoners were not asleep. The number of people was checked when handing over the shift to Yang. Han Haorui confessed that he was in charge of the outer gate and the iron gate. He handed over the shift to Yan Ling. Yang Xingcun and Yan Ling (of the 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM shift), the guards who were detained by the current inspection office, were brought to the case. Yang confessed that when he took over Wang Guanghe's shift, he checked seven cells, a total of 23 prisoners. Wu, Zhang, Zhu, and Chen in room 11 were not asleep. After handing over the shift to Fang Yuqi, the number of people was also checked. He usually did things seriously and inevitably made enemies. He requested an investigation. Yan Ling confessed that he was in charge of the outer gate and did not see Chen escape. Li Qin泉, the director of the guards, was summoned. According to his confession, checking the posts in the detention center was managed by Director Bai. He only managed the duties of receiving and withdrawing prisoners. At this point, it was past noon. The judge ordered the appellants and Chen, Wu, Zhang, Zhu, the four prisoners, and Yang and Yan, the two guards, to be returned to detention separately. The remaining people were dismissed and awaited a scheduled retrial, and then the court was adjourned. The public prosecution case of Chen Jinlan's escape has been tried and is scheduled to be pronounced this morning.</p>
<h3>In the American Camp, a Dispute Between Two Groups of Servants; The Leader of the Beijing Group Was Chopped; Two Murderers Were Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>Gu Wentong, also known as Quli, from Beijing, was a servant in the American camp on Xiaoshadu Road in Huxi. At around 6:00 AM on the 26th of last month, Gu passed the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Wuding Road when two people suddenly sprang out from the roadside, stopped Gu, and asked if his name was Quli. Gu replied no. They asked if his surname was Wang. Before Gu could answer, they pushed him to the ground, took out a sharp ax, and chopped him twice, causing serious injuries to Gu's left leg and hip. He fell to the ground, bleeding like a spring, almost dying. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, abandoned the ax and fled. After investigation by the patrol, the ax was recovered, and Gu was taken to the hospital for treatment, which saved him from danger. However, his injuries were serious, and he was hospitalized for treatment. The police reported to the Gordon Road Police Station and sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and hunt down the murderers. Until 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, Wu Zhongfu and Zhang Faxiang, two men from Jiangbei, were arrested at the Deyi Tea House on Xinzha Road and taken to the police station. Under interrogation, they admitted to the murder without hesitation and were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court to be prosecuted for the crime of serious injury in accordance with Article 294 of the Criminal Law. The victim Gu Wentong was also brought from the hospital. Because his leg injury had not yet healed and he could not walk properly, he was carried to the court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu then stood up and described the case in detail, saying that since the occurrence of this case, the police station had begun to investigate the truth of the case and learned that the cause of the incident was jealousy among colleagues. There were many servants in the American camp, which were divided into two factions, one was the Beijing faction and the other was the Jiangbei faction. The two factions had long-standing opinions. Gu Wentong, the victim, was the leader of the Beijing faction. The leader of the Jiangbei faction was named Tang Xiangui. A few days before the incident, several Jiangbei servants suddenly had their business suspended and suspected that Gu had provoked it, so they harbored deeper resentment, which led to this unfortunate incident. The police initially suspected Tang Xiangui, the leader of the Jiangbei faction, and the military authorities sent Tang to the police station. After investigation, there was no evidence, so Tang was released. Now that the murderers have been arrested, it is said that the instigator is someone else and should be interrogated. He also requested permission to reschedule the hearing. Because Gu Wentong could not stand, he was allowed to sit and be questioned. He said that he did not know the two defendants before the incident. When he passed the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Wuding Road that morning, the two defendants first came to question him, and then Zhang Faxiang pushed him to the ground, and Wu Zhongfu chopped him twice with an ax and fled. Wu Zhongfu confessed that Lu Asong, who used to be a servant in the camp, had now been suspended. That morning, Lu invited him to go together, but did not specify what it was for. He also asked Zhang Faxiang to go with him. When they arrived at Xiaoshadu Road, Lu said that he wanted to help him fight. After a while, he saw Gu coming towards him, and Lu shouted at him, "Move, move, move!" So Zhang pushed Gu to the ground, and he just chopped him twice, etc. Zhang Faxiang also confessed to helping. Judge Liu Yugui checked the confession and ordered Gu Wentong to be sent to the court for a medical examination. The two defendants were returned to detention and the hearing was rescheduled for next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Student National Goods Year: Tingwan Exhibition Concludes, Next Session Decided for Wusong District</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation, in order to actively promote national goods, specially held a district exhibition. The seventh district (Jiangwan) opened a few days ago at the Tongji Vocational School auditorium at the train station. Over the past two days, students from various schools and nearby residents who visited numbered no less than a thousand. The attached sales department also had brisk business.

<p>###太平 Insurance Company Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>Pacific Insurance Co., Ltd., located at No. 121 Jiangxi Road in this city, was founded in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. With strong capital and outstanding credit, its business scope is the largest among Chinese insurance companies. Currently, it has branches in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Harbin, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places. In addition to 198 agencies at various ports, including the Bank of Communications, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, Central China Bank, Continental Bank, China National Bank, and the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, there are 223 other specially appointed agencies, including Jiangsu Bank, Farmers Bank of China, Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, The National Pacific Bank, Cheng Ming Bank, Agricultural and Commercial Bank, The New China Trust and Savings Bank, The Kiangnan Bank, Shensi Provincial Bank, Honan Provincial Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Kiangsi Yumin Bank, and shops and companies, totaling 420 agencies. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month at 2:00 PM, the company convened its sixth shareholders' meeting at its head office. Thirty-five shareholders attended, representing 47,720 shares, which was sufficient to meet the statutory quorum. Zhou Zuomin, the managing director and general manager, represented the chairman of the board and delivered the opening speech. He briefly stated that the company had only been in operation for five weeks, and its business development had increased daily. The achievements of the past year were even better than in previous years. At a time when various industries are declining, the company has achieved these results, which is truly gratifying. Although the insurance business is one of the social undertakings, premium discounts should also have reasonable limits. Recently, due to competition among peers, premium discounts have been too low, which has affected the future of the business. In the future, the company will adhere to its past work ethic, provide practical service, and gradually progress in order to fully implement its original intention of serving society. Following this, he reported on the business situation of the 23rd year, the current status of the reserve fund and the reserve, briefly stating that in the 23rd year, the company's fire insurance, marine insurance (including mobile, bullion, parcel, hull, and wooden barge insurance), accident insurance (including automobile, elevator, military, theft, and glass insurance), and life insurance businesses had net premium income and commissions of 400,654.67 yuan for fire insurance, 148,923.22 yuan for marine insurance, 70,973.71 yuan for accident insurance, 75,745 yuan for life insurance, and over 220,000 yuan in interest. After deducting fire insurance claims of 113,332 yuan, marine insurance claims of 50,053.02 yuan, life insurance claims of 1,000 yuan, allocations of 100,000 yuan for the fire insurance reserve, 25,000 yuan for the marine insurance reserve, 25,000 yuan for the accident insurance reserve, 20,000 yuan for the special reserve, 44,813.05 yuan for the life insurance general reserve, 10,000 yuan for the special reserve, and all expenses of the head office, branches, and sub-branches, the total net profit was 254,267.11 yuan. The company has a statutory reserve fund of 69,000 yuan (including the current year), a fire insurance reserve of 100,000 yuan, a marine insurance reserve of 25,000 yuan, an accident insurance reserve of 25,000 yuan, a special reserve of 20,000 yuan, a life insurance general reserve of 10,000 yuan, and a staff welfare fund of 19,596.64 yuan.

<h3>A Changshu Passenger Boat Robbed at Jiwang Temple, Most Robbers Speak Local Accents, Losses Estimated at 600-700 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Taifeng, a riverboat belonging to the Shenqin Company in this city, was robbed in Jiading County, resulting in considerable losses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Encountering Robbers on the Way to Changshu</p>
<p>The Taifeng, a small passenger boat belonging to the Shenqin Company's riverboat company in this city, usually travels back and forth on the Shanghai-Changshu line, mainly carrying cargo. Most of the passengers are common people. This time, the boat departed from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 2nd, towed by boats from the Shuili and Yuechang companies. There were quite a few passengers on board, as it was approaching the time of temple fairs in various villages, and there were more passengers heading to Changshu than usual. However, not long after leaving Shanghai, it encountered robbers, and near the Shanghai area, which is extremely audacious.</p>
<p>Robbery Situation</p>
<p>The Taifeng boat arrived at Panlonggang, in the Jiwang Temple police district of Jiading County, and was proceeding forward. It was already around 1:00 AM at night when more than ten robbers, each holding a box gun and carrying a flashlight, came sailing towards them in a local ferryboat. Approaching the Taifeng boat, they immediately ordered it to stop, saying that if it did not stop, they would open fire. The captain had to stop the boat, and the robbers jumped onto the small boat and the company boat and immediately began to rob.</p>
<p>Amount of Loss</p>
<p>The robbers mostly spoke local accents, and their clothes were of varying lengths. After entering the company boat, they used firearms to threaten everyone, forbidding them from moving. At the same time, they began to rob, completely looting all the passengers, sparing no one. Boxes and clothes were opened and searched, and money and belongings, large and small, were taken. After an hour and a half, they left with shouts. The total loss robbed was estimated at 600-700 yuan.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police and Pursuit</p>
<p>When the robbers left, they ordered the captain to set sail immediately, forbidding any delay and not allowing anyone to make a sound. The boat did not carry much cargo, so it was not robbed. After the robbers left, the captain sailed to Changshu and immediately came to Shanghai on foot to report to the company. Yesterday, the Riverboat Association sent a telegram on their behalf to the provincial and county authorities, requesting them to pursue the robbers and asking them to take measures to protect the safety of navigation and travel.</p>
<p>Repeated Major Cases</p>
<p>The area around Panlonggang in Jiwang Temple has frequent cases of robbers robbing boats. In the past six months, the Xieyu, Gongmao, and Ju boats have been robbed and looted. It has been half a year since the incident, and although the Riverboat Bureau has requested a search, the case has not been solved to this day. Now there is another Taifeng boat robbery. Three boats have been robbed in a few months. In the future, small boats traveling in that port will feel very dangerous.</p>

<h3>Domestic Helper Beaten to Death, Husband's Lawsuit Verdict</h3>
<p>All Defendants Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Ni Lin, the 45-year-old wife of Ni Jikuan from Hefei, worked as a domestic helper at the home of Chen Li, a young woman from Fujian, at No. 4 Mingde Li, Huanlong Road in the French Concession of this city. On the evening of March 1, she went out to play with her fellow townsmen at the loft above No. 134 Pushi Road, and an argument arose due to the dumping of dirty water. She was dragged out and beaten by two ruffians, Fei Jinhai (nicknamed Xiao Zifan) and Zhang Xiaomao, and injured. She died the next morning. The police arrested the murderers Fei and Zhang one after another and sent them to the Second Special Court for investigation. As a result of the trial, Fei was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Zhang was sentenced to 7 years in prison, with both being deprived of their civil rights for the duration of their sentences. Ni Jikuan received the news in his hometown and came to Shanghai. According to his fellow townsmen Wang Benqian, Xu Shuqing, and women Han Sijie and Wang Jie, his wife was beaten to death by Fei and Zhang, instigated by Wang Yunwen, the owner of Shunxing Electrical Materials Company, and Chen Guanghan, the owner of Yuanmaoshun Hotel, who were at the scene, who incited Fei and Zhang to beat her together with Xiao Amei, Baoshan, Liangdu, and Axing. In addition, the employer Chen Li did not send her to the hospital and sent her directly to the pimp, which was also an act of abandonment. Ni immediately reported this to the police station, but because the statement was one-sided and no evidence was presented, it was rejected. Ni then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Wang Yunwen, Chen Guanghan, Xiao Amei, Baoshan, Liangdu, Axing, and Chen Li for instigating injury and abandonment resulting in death, and filed a civil suit, requesting 950 yuan for lost wages and 500 yuan for funeral expenses. The court summoned the defendants based on the lawsuit. Except for Xiao Amei, Baoshan, and Liangdu, who could not be summoned, the other defendants appeared in court as summoned. Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened the court for trial. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case has now been concluded. The judgment was rendered a few days ago that Wang Yunwen, Chen Guanghan, Axing, and Chen Li were all not guilty, and the plaintiff's civil suit was rejected. A series of disputes arising from a case of injury resulting in death came to an end. It is also rumored that the plaintiff was unable to transport the coffin back to his hometown because he did not receive compensation in either case. He is still difficult to accept this judgment. Whether he will appeal remains to be seen. Fei Jinhai and Zhang Xiaomao expressed their dissatisfaction with the original verdict and filed an appeal with the Third High Court. The presiding judge, Xiong, opened an investigation in the High Court the day before yesterday to summon and examine the evidence from the witnesses, and ordered the appellants to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>

<p>Celebrity Dai Writes Birthday Screens with Affordable Fees</p>
<p>Zhang Jun Dan'an is a prominent family in Lanling with a long family tradition and is diligent in studying. He is well-versed in the theories of various scholars and philosophers. His writing style imitates Sima Qian and explores Liu Zongyuan, and does not follow a fixed path. Therefore, his reputation spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, and his works were highly regarded in the art world. A certain official in Rong sui commissioned him with substantial funds to write 心 for his deceased mother and inscribe her epitaph, through the introduction of those who were familiar with Mr. Zhang. On the 20th of last month, when Mr. Cao Youshan celebrated his 70th birthday in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang wrote two birthday screens, each containing thousands of words, with each word being as precious as a pearl, rich and magnificent. Those who saw them praised them repeatedly. Therefore, those who sought his writing day and night flocked to him. Places outside Shanghai such as Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Wuhu, etc., have all sent letters to order them. Mr. Zhang is fortunate to be in good health and is willing to leave more writings in the world. Therefore, he responds to all requests and charges affordable fees. The birthday screens are made and written continuously, at six yuan per piece, and can be completed in as little as one week without delay. Other biographies, 墓志, birthday couplets, elegiac couplets, birthday poems, eulogies, and portraits are also handled urgently and with moderation. Those who need them urgently can pick them up the next day, and small items can be done immediately. The receiving address is Yada Bank, Tianjin Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item in your newspaper titled "Conflict among Porters at the North Station". After investigation, it is inconsistent with the facts. Yesterday morning, our general foreman Gao Ge, due to his special expertise, was suddenly attacked by Liu Chaoguan, Li Guangjin, and others who were carrying pistols, iron hooks, and iron rulers. Without saying a word, they severely injured Gao Ge in the left and right temples. There was no dispute over the amount of porterage. We are afraid that the rumors are untrue. We hereby send a letter to you, respectfully requesting correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Ninghangyong Railway Warehouse Workers Cooperative Society, May 5th.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>영업 Report of the Bank of Communications (8)</h3>
<p>(V) Issuance. The total balance of exchange coupons issued by our bank in the 23rd year was more than 11,251,200 yuan, an increase of more than 1,950,07,000 yuan compared to the 20th year, and an increase of more than 1,801,1000 yuan compared to the 21st year. The issuance amount of all coupons is listed as follows: (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, the increase in the amount issued this year is still the largest for Shanghai coupons, because the number of institutions in Jiangbei and inland has increased, and the use of Shanghai coupons is becoming more widespread. The promotion of Shandong, Island, and Yantai coupons is also progressing steadily due to business development. Hankou coupons were first issued last year and have been well received by people in Hankou. Xiamen coupons have been in circulation for just three months and have achieved considerable results. It seems that the future is promising. However, the promotion of Tianjin coupons is more difficult due to the narrower circulation area.</p>
<p>(VI) Profit and Loss. The net profit of our bank in the 23rd year was more than 900,07,000 yuan, an increase of more than 6,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 500,06,000 yuan compared to the 21st year. Analyzing the content of profit and loss this year, the revenue side is still dominated by interest and handling fees, with a total income of more than 5,161,000 yuan, an increase of more than 118,000 yuan compared to the 21st year. This is the result of business development. As for the loss side, the various expenses amounted to more than 300,088,000 yuan, which is still about the same as last year. Various amortizations amounted to more than 716,000 yuan, bad debts amounted to more than 120,000 yuan, and issuance tax amounted to more than 328,000 yuan. The total loss amounted to more than 4,254,000 yuan. After deducting profit and loss, the net profit was more than 900,07,000 yuan. In addition, the net profit of the savings department of our bank in the 23rd year was more than 86,000 yuan, an increase of more than 6,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. This is the general situation of profit and loss this year.</p>
<p>B. Work Situation</p>
<p>(I) Development of the Northwest. The area in western Henan and central Shaanxi is the essence of the Northwest, rich in products, especially cotton. Places such as Lingbao, Shaanxi Prefecture, Weinan, and Xianyang are famous cotton producing areas, and the cotton produced in Lingbao is of good quality and can be regarded as the best in the country. If investments are made in the above areas to develop and promote cotton fields and improve planting, the domestic shortage of raw cotton can be supplied from the Northwest. In the past, incidents occurred frequently in these areas, and investment was not possible. Now, politics has entered a normal track, banditry is gradually being eliminated, and local authorities are making efforts to advance all constructions, such as opening rivers, building roads, eradicating opium seedlings, reclaiming wasteland, and establishing cooperatives. Furthermore, the westward expansion of the 海路 line is also underway, and investment is no longer hindered. Therefore, after repeated investigations, it was decided to set up agencies in five locations: Xi'an, Xianyang, Weinan, Lingshi, and Shaanxi Prefecture, before the cotton market season. Since opening, various cotton industry investments such as cotton mortgage, cotton ticket purchase, and deposit loans for packing plants have been considerable. In the future, depending on the needs, they will be gradually promoted to other cotton producing areas.</p>
<p>(II) Development of Fujian and Guangdong. Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places are adjacent to Southeast Asia and are the hub of overseas Chinese funds and the center of foreign exchange. Fuzhou is the provincial capital, and although it is a transit port, its vicinity produces quite a lot. Guangzhou is a major city in the Southeast, and both water and land transportation are convenient. In the future, the connection of the Wuhan-Hankou full line will be completed, and the situation will be even more important. Our bank originally had considerable operations in the above areas. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the institutions established have been gradually closed down. Several years ago, it was proposed to revive them, but due to environmental reasons, it did not proceed. Now, the political situation in the Southwest is gradually stabilizing, and various constructions are making progress. Furthermore, our bank's business line has also extended south to the Wenzhou area. The re-establishment of institutions in Fujian and Guangdong cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, agencies have been set up in Hong Kong, Macau, and Fuzhou. The site of Guangzhou has also been surveyed and is actively being prepared. In addition, there are other places such as Zhangzhou and Shantou that are under investigation and are being promoted one by one in the upper reaches of the Minjiang and Pearl Rivers, so as to link up with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yang Xieli)</p>
<p>There are two phrases in the dialect of Yiwu, Zhejiang: "Teach the son in front of the hall, teach the husband in the room"; "Thousands of volumes of scriptures and thousands of words of family teachings are not as good as a word on the pillow."</p>
<p>From the first sentence, we feel that the responsibility of being a wife is really great. Not only must she have the ability to educate her children, but she must also gently persuade her husband of his faults, encourage his career as much as possible, and be considerate and comforting when her husband is wronged. Only in this way can she be considered to have fulfilled her responsibility of "teaching the husband".</p>
<p>From the second sentence, the words of a wife to her husband really have unexpected effects. Often in this world, brothers become discordant and families lose harmony because of a wife's words. How careful should wives be in their words and conversations with their husbands!</p>
<h3>Daonan Residence</h3>
<p>— Wan Song</p>
<p>In Peking opera, the main characters in "Yellow Crane Tower", Zhou Yu and Lu Su, are probably known to everyone who has read Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Zhou Yu was from Shucheng, and Lu Su was from Lujiang. Lu Su's family was very wealthy. When Zhou Yu came to rely on him, he gave Zhou Yu a "Daonan Residence." This is a story recorded in history. Their chivalry is so admirable!</p>
<p>But where is "Daonan Residence"? This time, on my way from Hefei to Shucheng, passing through the western countryside of Hefei, I discovered their hometown and the location of the so-called "Daonan Residence":</p>
<p>Near Juxingji, more than ninety li west of Hefei, there is a Mount Zhougong, said to be named after Zhou Yu. Near Mount Zhougong, there is a Yuquan Village, which is Zhou Yu's hometown. Two or three li south of the village, there is a Daonan Academy, said to be the site of the "Daonan Residence." I once stayed overnight at this Daonan Academy. It is in the depths of the mountains, with a clear stream, surrounded by lush greenery, and buildings hidden behind white walls. The charming scenery is comparable to the mountains and rivers of Jiangnan. Locals call it Feixi Academy, said to be established by Hefei's famous Huai Army generals: Liu Zhuangsu, Zhou Gangmin, Zhou Wuzhuang, Zhang Jingda, Zhang Yonglie, Tang Zhongzhuang, and Tang Guojie. During the Qing Dynasty, many students were happy to take monthly exams here, and the literary style was very prosperous! But now the noble families have declined, and this "Daonan Academy", the cultural center of Hefei, has also become a training ground for military affairs and is used as a liaison office for joint defense. However, the story of Daonan Residence is known to everyone in Hefei, and the Hefei County Chronicle also has this record.</p>
<h3>Stonehead Fish</h3>
<p>— Countryman</p>
<p>In late spring and early summer, a kind of fish is abundant along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It has a flat body, a wide mouth, with the upper jaw longer than the lower jaw, fine scales, and a yellow color like gold; so it is called "Yellow Croaker" (黃花魚), commonly known as "Yellow Fish" (黃魚). Because there are two stone-like small pieces inside its head, it is also called "Stonehead Fish" (石首魚).</p>
<p>Stonehead fish are divided into two sizes, large ones weighing one or two jin, which are delicious whether fried or steamed. Small ones are less than a foot long and weigh only seven or eight liang. The meat is not very plump and can only be dried to make salted fish, called "自鮝." It can also be mixed with pork lard to make "fish floss." Small stonehead fish are produced in large quantities, so the price is very cheap. Sometimes one or two copper coins can buy one. In autumn and winter, these small stonehead fish are produced in very small quantities, called "Osmanthus Yellow Fish" (桂花黃魚), and each one cannot be bought for less than one or two jiao. People who eat it also think that the more expensive ones taste better, and the cheaper ones don't taste good, which is really a joke.</p>
<p>In midsummer, small stonehead fish often have a kind of small worm in their abdomen, wriggling and moving, in large numbers. When eating it, you should wash it thoroughly before cooking and eating. Otherwise, these small worms will of course be harmful if eaten.</p>
<p>The meat of stonehead fish is rich in protein and is very delicious when stewed with brine shrimp melon juice. Mixed with wheat flour and a little baking soda, it can be made into fried fish balls, which are very good snacks when seasoned with vinegar. In addition, making floss and sun-drying, there are many ways to eat stonehead fish. Jin Lu Shilong answered Che Maoan's letter and said: "...Sliced 鱠鰡, roasted 　　, steamed stonehead, 臛　　, are truly the fine flavors of the East China Sea, the best of dishes!" At this time, Lu Shilong was in Deng County for more than thirty days, and he saw many seafoods. He also praised stonehead fish very much. (Note: Zheng County is now Ningbo. A certain gentleman calls Ningbo "Fish City", and there is a reason for it).</p>

<p>Look, military businessmen! Who says the industrial scene is booming?</p>
<h3>Legs</h3>
<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>How pitiful, these two legs of mine.</p>
<p>But, these two legs of mine are not for running around with noble people.</p>
<p>Legs give people convenience; but sitting on me is too pitiful; because no matter how far away the journey is, ten or eight miles, these two legs have to run. Yesterday, I went from the station to my residence, and from my residence to the station, running back and forth four times, a distance of ten miles: although I pity these legs, but; I didn't spend a penny on transportation, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>When I sit and rest, I often roll up my sleeves, stroke them, and admire my own legs.</p>
<p>Beautiful? Not worthy of praise. The dark skin, hard and weed-like hairs, when my hands touch my legs, I feel a prickling pain. I hate, I resent. When I straighten them hard, they have a lot of strength. The muscles bulge, revealing healthy beauty. After all, these two legs of mine are lovely; but I call my own legs beautiful.</p>
<p>Jade legs are shiny, and they are probably praising women's legs. Yes, I often see them in movie theater advertisements. It is said that women also put powder on their legs. That's right. Because the consumption of powder by Chinese women is huge, there is an astonishing possibility of importing cosmetics from abroad, and the money flowing out of China is naturally also large. Screw him, as long as the jade legs are shiny, and there are many people praising, admiring, turning over, losing their souls, and dying drunk, what does he care if the money flows out of the country.</p>
<p>Delicate legs, shiny and lovely, and powdered, fragrant, can naturally make people praise, turn over, lose their souls, and die drunk. Hey... my legs are scary enough, no one will turn over or lose their souls; but I always love my own legs, because they can run long distances and save money.</p>
<p>Women's jade legs can turn the world upside down, and my legs can run long distances. Compared, my legs are naturally inferior.</p>
<p>Small Local Chronicles</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Summer Festival in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>The green shade of the fields welcomes the summer solstice. Just as the red rain of flowers in the courtyard sends off the spring, and the cherries turn red and the plantain turns green, the spring light has already grown old. The Beginning of Summer Festival in Suzhou is a festival for people. Every household buys seasonal foods to enjoy, and there are also several customary stories that must be performed on the day of the Beginning of Summer Festival.</p>
<p>The biggest event of the Beginning of Summer Festival is "weighing people." A large steelyard scale is hung from a beam in the house, and each member of the family is hung on the hook to be weighed. Those who lack the strength to hold on use a carrying pole support as a seat to hang from the scale. As for the children, they are weighed in baskets. It is said that the act of weighing people is to avoid "summer wasting." However, since the health of Chinese people has never been tested, weighing people can check a person's weight and compare it to last year to see if it is heavier or lighter, allowing people to know the strength of their bodies. The intention is very profound.</p>
<p>The Beginning of Summer Festival, like the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a festival for people, so there are several foods that are essential on that day, such as salted duck eggs, yellow croaker, and broad beans. In the past, salted duck eggs were mostly homemade. Around the Qingming Festival, the duck eggs were washed clean, and then edible salt and rice straw ash were mashed finely and mixed with wine and meat broth. This was stirred into a paste-like wet brine, and then wrapped around the eggshell so that the saltiness would permeate the egg. When eating, the black ash is washed off and steamed in a rice cooker. Around the Beginning of Summer Festival, the salted duck eggs are just ripe, with a rich but mild flavor, and the yolk also contains egg oil, making them delicious to eat. As for broad beans and yellow croaker, they are also fresh seasonal foods that are indispensable in the dishes of the Beginning of Summer Festival.</p>
<p>The snacks for the Beginning of Summer Festival are the most numerous: there are fermented rice, sea snails, wheat silkworms, cherries, water chestnuts, green plums, and so on. The taste of fermented rice is slightly alcoholic, so it tastes sweet and strange in the mouth, and children love to eat it. Around the Beginning of Summer Festival, fermented rice is sold everywhere, not only in shops that specialize in selling it, but also on the streets. Sea snails are shelled animals from the sea with long shells, slightly thinner than screws, but the taste is not particularly wonderful. Eating them is like sucking on snails, which is very laborious. Wheat silkworms are made by pounding new wheat into a paste, which is mushy like blue mud, and the taste is not particularly wonderful either. Suzhou's water chestnuts are a famous local product. Around the Beginning of Summer Festival, water chestnuts are at their best, peeled and eaten, they are very sweet and tender. The green plums around the Beginning of Summer Festival are small, not yet fully grown, and taste very bitter, making them unpleasant to chew. However, according to custom, it is said that wearing them on the head can prevent "summer wasting."</p>
<p>Among the foods of the Beginning of Summer Festival, there is also a strange food that Suzhou families prepare to eat on the Beginning of Summer Festival. That food is a piece of tile cake. The cake is bought on Qingming Festival, strung with willow branches, and hung in a ventilated place to dry. It is not taken down and shared until the Beginning of Summer Festival. The cake is dried by the wind for a long time and is as hard as iron, but in order to avoid "summer wasting," everyone must taste a little. In addition, the "door-propping charcoal" placed in the corner of the door on New Year's Eve (this is also a Suzhou custom, where thin strips of charcoal are sealed with red paper and placed in the corners of doors everywhere) are picked out and used to make tea, which is said to be a way to avoid summer wasting. These are the customs of the Beginning of Summer Festival in Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Little Western Sky</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, Drawing Curtains to Avoid Guests; Diligently Saving Lamp Oil, Copying Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Their windows are basically square holes in the wall. Even the lattice made of wood is only a foot square. How can paper pasted on this survive the wind? Speaking of this, I even made a fool of myself. I said to that student, "Since the room is dark, wouldn't it be better to copy inside with a lamp than outside?" Afterwards, someone pointed it out to me, and it was truly a "why not eat meat porridge" kind of joke. The principal, to make me understand the reason why the lights were not lit in the room, specifically asked me to go back again half a day later. In the twilight, I finally made it to their dinner. However, the principal, knowing that I could not bear that hardship, did not invite me to dinner. The students seemed very rushed, each hurrying to the kitchen to get a bowl of millet soup. In the other hand, they held a black steamed bun, taking a bite and drinking a mouthful of millet soup, and had their dinner in the courtyard. Then I understood why they were rushing to eat, it was precisely to seize that little bit of twilight, to avoid eating under the lamp. After dinner, in the room where twenty or so students were, there were only three lamps in total, casting a pale yellow light from three windows. I decided to go into the student dormitory to take a look. Seeing the tattered bedding on their beds, illuminated by the small lamplight, it seemed to evoke a sense of desolation. Zhou Yourong said: "With more than twenty students sharing two or three kerosene lamps, naturally they cannot study, but I don't know if the lamp oil is paid for by the students themselves, or provided by the school?"

<h3>Records of the Fragrant Imperial Odor</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As for food and drink, they were given especially preferential treatment. Each meal was sure to have extremely sumptuous dishes for them to enjoy. Their meals were prepared by the imperial kitchen just like the Empress Dowager's. How could the food used by ordinary wives and relatives of minor officials compare to theirs? Moreover, when they ate, there were several eunuchs standing by to serve them dishes, rice, and clear the table. They did not have to lift a finger themselves. Even their bedrooms were cleaned by small eunuchs taking turns every day. Therefore, apart from embroidering phoenix shoes and making socks for the Empress Dowager, they could be said to have nothing to do. Wasn't this a bit too preferential? But to tell the truth, it was not worth smiling at! Originally, the work of embroidery, if one wanted it to be smooth and clean, was greatly related to the fingers of the artisans. If their fingers became rough because they were constantly in contact with rough things, then the silk threads would inevitably be frayed when they embroidered flowers. For this reason, the Empress Dowager did not allow them to do other work. If it were not so, they could not expect to have any eunuchs waiting on them, and they would have to take care of everything themselves!</p>
<p>According to the Empress Dowager, these shoe-making artisans were extremely difficult to cultivate. Usually, no matter how clever a little girl was, or how skilled she was at ordinary embroidery, it would take at least three years of learning to come to the palace to make shoe patterns, embroider shoe flowers, and make socks for the Empress Dowager, otherwise it would be impossible to start! Indeed, such complex and profound techniques, in my opinion, even if one studied for three years, one might not be able to master them completely, and one might not have good results. I feel that unless one has studied for three years and then dedicated oneself to this work for four or five years, one will never be able to deeply understand the secrets and use them freely, because there are many secrets that cannot be obtained with a single search.

<h3>The Chinese Team Wins the China-Portugal Cup. Having Won for Three Years, the Cup Permanently Belongs to China. Yesterday's Battle Ended in a Thrilling 3-3 Draw.</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Portuguese teams had their second match at the Shen Garden yesterday. The Chinese team had Jiang Lu, Li Ning, and others joining, and the lineup was extremely complete, but the performance was far from as good as before. After the last defeat, Portugal reorganized and prepared for revenge. Although General Remy Dee was absent, the combat power was still very strong. The Chinese team was constantly under attack and in imminent danger. Fortunately, they managed to achieve a 2-2 draw. Later, luck came and they took a 3-2 lead. In the last three minutes, Portugal scored a 3-3 draw. In total, the Chinese team had one win and one draw, and the victory for this year already belonged to China. According to the history of the cup, Portugal has won once and China has won three times, so the cup has become a permanent commemorative trophy for China. However, the third match will still be held. It has been scheduled for this Sunday afternoon at 4:00 PM, still at the Shen Garden. Due to the hot weather, it will be changed to forty minutes, with a change of direction. From next year, a new cup will be made for the competition, it is said. The details of yesterday's battle are described below:</p>
<p>The Situation Was Extremely Thrilling. In yesterday's battle, the Chinese team lacked coordination. Li Ning and Jiang Shanjing's performances were very ordinary. The midfield line also lacked special characteristics. Jiang Lu had great momentum and delivered wonderful passes, but unfortunately could not cooperate with Xu Wenkui. Jia Youliang and Fu Zhibin performed well. Sun Jinshun was closely watched by the opponent and was unable to achieve his goals. The situation was actually not as good as the opponent's. The Portuguese team's defense line was exceptionally strong, the forwards were very fast, and the coordination was also good. In the second half, the attack became even more intense. The Chinese team was under attack from all sides and was surrounded by crises. Only after half an hour did they start to improve, and they were able to create a draw under adverse circumstances.</p>
<p>Portugal Took the Initiative. At half past three, with a command from Shen Huichun, the Chinese team kicked off the attack with great momentum. Jiang Lu launched an attack on the flank but missed. Sun Jinshun made a move near the goal, but it was saved by the goalkeeper. The Portuguese team launched an attack, with Costa crossing the ball far in front of the goal. Zhang Rongcai and the opposing player hugged each other, and Fafan Ke and others charged together, resulting in a corner kick. Fafan Ke kicked a very good ball, Costa headed it in front of the goal, and Natuo added a foot, scoring a goal.</p>
<p>Jia Youliang Retaliated. After the Chinese team lost a goal, the entire army was furious and immediately launched a counterattack. Jiang Lu quickly passed the ball to the center, Sun Jinshun saw the opportunity and moved forward, but accidentally went over the goal, which was a great pity. After twenty minutes, Jiang Shanjing was injured and left the field for treatment, and immediately returned to the field. Jia Youliang passed the ball to Fu Zhibin, who chased it to the baseline and saved it to the front of the goal. Jia rushed up and shot from the side with great force. The enemy was helpless and a draw was achieved.</p>
<p>Portugal Continued to Attack Fiercely. After the Chinese team recovered lost ground, the morale of the people was at ease. Xu Wenkui was ambitious and shot with force, but it was blocked back. Jiang Lu counterattacked but missed. Portugal refused to give up, and Fafan Ke acted rampantly in front of the goal, passing the ball high to the center. Li Ning headed the ball, but could not save it. Fortunately, Gong Shanfu headed the ball wide. Fafan Ke attacked again and shot from an angle, hitting the target, but the right wing was offside, wasting effort.</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai Turned Danger into Safety. As the battle restarted, although the Chinese team tried hard to cheer up, they were unable to improve because the opponent's surveillance was very strict. The Portuguese team's offensive became more intense, and Li Jiang found it difficult to parry. Although Sun Jinshun once fought alone, he achieved nothing. Gong Shanfu received a pass from Fafan Ke, and the position was excellent, but the ball bounced off his hand and he was penalized. Fafan Ke made a comeback and scored another goal, but Luo Chailuo was offside and it was not counted. Costa suddenly released a cold arrow, the ball was very fast, Zhang Rongcai did not panic and caught it with both hands, turning danger into safety, winning thunderous applause from the entire field.</p>
<p>Kolasar Scored a Critical Goal Again. At this time, it can be said that it was the heyday of Portugal, surrounding the Chinese team and launching attacks in a continuous stream, causing the Chinese defense to lose sight of the other, and only able to parry without the power to counterattack. After half an hour of fierce fighting, Kolasar finally scored a goal. Kolasar owed his strength to Gong Shanfu, running and jumping, shouting and roaring, passing through Li Ning and killing to the front of the goal, scoring with one shot. The Chinese team was once again at a disadvantage with a score of 1-2. Seeing this situation, everyone thought that the Chinese team would definitely lose, but who knew that the situation would change unpredictably and the Chinese team's stamina was terrifying, and they suddenly gained the upper hand again.</p>
<p>Zhibin and Jiang Lu Both Contributed. The Portuguese team took the lead again with a score of 2-1. The Chinese team refused to admit defeat. In less than two minutes, Jia Youliang went straight in along the side and passed across the enemy's goal. Fu Zhibin rushed from the right and shot with force, the ball streaking into the bottom of the net from the left corner. All the spectators admired the Chinese team's speed in using their troops. After entering, the Chinese team's momentum turned stronger. Jiang Lu was a famous general, riding alone and entering the road, also making a contribution. This ball was kicked cleanly and beautifully, and the Chinese team took the lead with a score of 3-2.</p>
<p>Costa Scored a Draw. After the army lost one city after another, their morale did not decrease slightly. However, the Chinese athletes suddenly appeared tired, and the Portuguese army took the opportunity to counterattack. The ball often lingered in front of the Chinese goal. In the last five minutes, Fafan Ke had the opportunity to attack the goal. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai jumped up too early and failed to catch the ball. The ball fell to the right, and Costa took the opportunity to sweep it in, scoring a 3-3 draw.</p>

<h3>Attending the International Games. The Chinese Preliminary Selection Ended Yesterday. Ms. Qian Hangsu Lost to Li Sen Again.</h3>
<p>Representatives to be Selected on Wednesday</p>
<p>The Chinese preliminary selection for the Shanghai International Games continued at Shen Garden yesterday morning. The weather was pleasant, which was perfect for fighting fiercely and creating excellent results. Unfortunately, since the beginning of spring, it has been repeatedly blocked by the weather and lacked training, so the results were not very satisfactory. The athletes attending the International Games will be decided by the committee on Wednesday and then announced. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<p>100 Meters: Veteran Hao Chunde gave up, so it became an opportunity for the new players to compete. Xue Jianqiu, who had the best results in the preliminaries, and Dong Yinchu, who competed fiercely with Xue, were defeated by Tong Yuchun and Ye Songping. Along the way, the situation was average, and it was almost difficult to distinguish the top and bottom. As a result, Tong Yuchun won first place with 11.6 seconds, Ye came second, and Dong and Xue were in third and fourth place. Ye Songping was still strong in the 200-meter competition. Ye Songping, who was previously unknown, was elected chief, beating Dong Yinchu by only one meter. The result was 24.5 seconds.</p>
<p>1500 Meters: Wang Zhenglin gave up. Jia Lianren, the champion of the 800 meters, ran this competition for the first time and won the first place with a time of 4 minutes and 30.3 seconds. Although the result was average, the beauty of his steps and the strength of his sprint meant that he would have great achievements in the future if given time. In the first two and a half laps, he was lurking in the last two. Xu Eryi took the lead, leading by about twenty meters. In the last four hundred meters, Jia stepped forward, his steps were wide, and he won the second place, Guan Youwen, by a distance of forty meters. Xu Eryi, who had previously taken the lead, fell to the last place.</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles Preliminary Round: Originally a program for the afternoon of the previous day, it was moved to yesterday due to time constraints. Also, due to time constraints and fear that the athletes would not have enough energy, only the preliminary round was held and there was no final. The preliminary round results were used to evaluate the merits and demerits as a selection criterion. Tao Yingjie won the first group. He was calm and unhurried. Because there was no one to compete with, his results were reduced, only 64.1 seconds. Sun Hupei won the first group with 63.5 seconds, and Li Houda had 62.8 seconds. If a final was held, then Sun, Tao, and Li would have a competition.</p>
<p>Three Field Events: The high jump results were more impressive. Xu Wenkui, Zhu Wenji, Luo Douwen, and Chen Tianhe all jumped over the final height of 1.745 meters at the same time. Because it was a preliminary selection and to save time, no other final was held, so they were tied for first place. The above four people are all promising talents. When they reached 1.795 meters, they all had hoped to pass, but they accidentally touched the crossbar and fell down, which was a pity. For the discus throw, Gong Wanyu only got 33.73 meters, Huang Tinggu 32.15 meters in second place, Ma Qingyuan 32.135 meters in third place, and Cheng Bichun only 31.685 meters in fourth place. There were very few people in the pole vault. The starting point of 2.90 meters eliminated two people. After that, three people competed and Wang He won the championship with 3.45 meters.</p>
<p>Women's Track Events: Qian Hangsu still had no progress. In the 50-meter race, she was still defeated by Ms. Li Sen from the Southeast Women's Physical Education School. After five meters from the start, Li rushed to the forefront, winning by a distance of one meter. Seven seconds two was still a good result. Chen Zaichun competed for the second place, with a small difference. In the 100-meter race, someone gave up and did not compete. Li Sen was the first to be in the lead, very pleased. However, Chen Zaichun tried her best to catch up, not far behind. In the high jump, Lu Shu won first place with 1.28 meters. The female athlete Lu has a very good figure. If she can practice hard, she will definitely have great achievements. The fourth-place Liu Zuoyu is also worth considering, but her footwork is not good. Liu and Hu Yueying and Rong Shuzhen all jumped over 1.245 meters at the same time and had another jump to decide. Hu got second place, and Rong got third place. The full results are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Jointly Organized by Four Organizations – Science Toy Exhibition Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 1,000 Exhibits on Display in Two Sections – Event Runs for One Week, Closing on the 11th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Scientific Movement Association, the Children's Welfare Association, and the Civic Education Center jointly organized the city's Science Toy Exhibition, which opened yesterday. The event will run for one week, with over 1,000 exhibits. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The opening ceremony was held at 10 AM in the lecture hall of the Civic Education Center. Attendees included Tao Baichuan and Zhou Saimei from the Cultural Construction Association, Chen Gaimin from the Scientific Movement Association, Qian Fugong from the Children's Welfare Association, Chen Songchun from the Civic Education Center, and Cao Peizi, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters. The presidium consisted of Tao Baichuan, Tong Xingbai (representing Cao), and Chen Gaimin. Qian Jinglü served as the master of ceremonies, and Zhou Saimei served as the recorder. After the customary ceremonies, Chairman Chen Gaimin delivered the opening remarks, followed by a speech by Cao Peizi, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>Brief Overview of the Exhibition: This exhibition features over 1,500 exhibits, all of which are domestic products. They are displayed in two sections and are divided into categories such as national defense, transportation, specimens, furniture, agricultural tools, and sports. The collection is quite complete. However, the organizers have not paid attention to several points in terms of display: (1) Toys related to transportation should be arranged in chronological order to allow visiting children to learn about the evolution of transportation tools in China; (2) The exhibition should focus on children's visits, so the displays should not be placed too high, making it difficult for children to see; (3) The lighting in the exhibition hall is too dim. It is best to use the large outdoor space and not arrange the exhibits too densely. The aisles should be separated into inner and outer circles with barriers, with the inner circle for children and the outer circle for adults, so that children attending the exhibition will not be crowded by adults and unable to access the exhibits. Yesterday, elementary school students from Songxue Wuben and other schools visited the exhibition. The Shanghai Girls' High School Boy Scouts maintained order at the venue.</p>
<h3>Law Department Student Unions Hold Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Agreed on Response Steps, Awaiting Reply, Private School Authorities Met the Night Before to Discuss Response</p>
<p>Due to the fact that students from Zhonggong have received a reply from the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding the temporary examination for judicial officials, which does not allow graduates of private schools to participate, the emotions of the students of the Law Departments of private universities in the city are agitated. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures.</p>

Ren chaired the meeting, and Huanxin recorded. The chairman first reported on the various cases submitted by the last meeting.</p>
<p>Serious Situation, Vow to Fight for Equality: Next, the revised articles of association were discussed and passed, and the decision of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to reply to Zhonggong that it is difficult to make changes to the temporary examination for judicial officials for private school graduates was discussed. After further expressions, the general assembly studied in detail and debated for an hour. It was decided to await the reply from the relevant central authorities to the association before making a decision. The response steps (confidential) were passed by the general assembly and handed over to the executive committee for full handling.</p>
<p>Private School Authorities Also Discuss Response: The authorities of private schools also gathered at the YMCA on Yaxian Bridge the night before, attended by representatives from various schools, and discussed the content. All details were not released. It was decided that they were also discussing how to respond to the temporary examination for judicial officials.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Position of Siamese Rice in China's Food Supply</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>A month ago, it was reported that the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee intended to prohibit the import of Siamese rice, but then there was talk of a more moderate implementation. Before long, the Overseas Chinese Federation also believed that the oppression of overseas Chinese in Siam was becoming increasingly severe, and that it was necessary to boycott Siamese rice to awaken the Siamese people, and appealed to all parties. Speaking of the relationship between Siam and China, it began very early, and even in terms of its people, it is similar to the southern ethnic groups. Before the opening of the sea ban, many people from Guangdong and Fujian went to Siam, and the hard work of opening up roads was done by the Chinese. However, since a part of Siam colluded with the Japanese, they have repeatedly taken actions unfavorable to the Chinese. Recently, the oppression of overseas Chinese is almost aimed at complete assimilation into the Siamese people, which is a very deep intention and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Siam is rich in rice, so the price of rice is often cheap; Guangdong and Fujian lack rice, so the price of rice is always expensive. Therefore, Siamese rice has been used to help us out of poverty since the early Qing Dynasty. Generally, Siamese rice is mostly sold in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Xiamen is second, and Tianjin in the north does not sell much. Siamese rice has a better quality and is more expensive. Although Shanghai is a large distribution area for foreign rice, those who can afford high-priced rice prefer to eat japonica rice; those who cannot afford it prefer to eat cheap Saigon small-grained rice. Therefore, Siamese rice is not considered important in Shanghai. However, in Guangdong Province, foreign rice accounts for about 70% of the rice supply each year, and local rice accounts for about 30%. Among this 70% of foreign rice, Siamese rice is certainly a considerable portion. Rice is also the main export commodity of Siam, and most of the exported rice is sold to China. Therefore, if China does not buy its rice, Japan may not be able to help absorb this large surplus grain, and Siam's economy will inevitably be significantly affected.</p>
<p>For us, if we suddenly implement a ban on Siamese rice, what will be the impact on our people's food supply? This should be examined in terms of the position of imported Siamese rice in our total rice imports. I have made a statistical analysis based on records. Since the founding of the Republic, except for 1920, when there were no imports due to Japanese speculation, the largest amount of Siamese rice imported in any year was 7,551,554 dan in 1933, and the smallest was 195 dan in 1912. In the year with the largest imports, it accounted for more than 30% of the total amount of imported foreign rice. However, the total amount of Siamese rice imported in 1933 was only 24,159,100 dan, less than the total of 270,294,209 dan of all imported foreign rice. However, the amount of Siamese rice imported in 1932 was actually not small. Therefore, we should pay attention that before 1931, the amount of Siamese rice imported as recorded by the customs may have largely been included in the imports of Hong Kong. Therefore, in 1932, the amount of rice imported from Annam and the interior of Siam increased significantly, while the amount of rice imported from Hong Kong suddenly decreased significantly. Therefore, this was not a change in quantity, but a change in customs administrative procedures, which gradually focused on the place of origin. Before 1931, a large portion of the rice imported from Hong Kong must have been Siamese and Annamese rice. If this is the case, the amount of Siamese rice sold to China is not small, but it may not occupy a very important position, because the rice sold in China is still mainly Annamese rice.</p>
<p>To protect our nation, we are willing to make sacrifices. Moreover, it is not difficult to find alternatives to boycott a portion of rice. What should be noted is whether Guangdong, which has always consumed Siamese rice and is close to Hong Kong, can implement the boycott thoroughly. If it cannot, it will not only be useless but also cause resentment. It would be better to find another solution. But for the sake of the Siamese people, do not think that China is poor and weak and can be deceived, and do not rely on the Japanese as if they were a secure support. Do not forget the contributions of the Chinese people in developing Siam together, and do not forget the friendship of close neighbors. I do not see the benefit of this. As for increasing the import tax on Siamese rice alone as a means of boycott, it is not allowed by the current situation. There is no need to say more about this. The following table shows the comparison between the total amount of Siamese rice imported and the total amount of foreign rice imported from 1912 to 1933 (unit: dan).</p>

<h3>A New Design for the "Cotton Industry Network"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xianfang</p>
<p>Production is a crucial plan for economic construction. A country, formed by the three elements of land, people, and sovereignty, must use its political power to guide its people in its territory to engage in production and construction, so that the products can meet the needs of all citizens; then it can exchange its surplus for what it lacks to enrich the country or meet the needs of other countries and exchange for wealth. Only then can the national economy be prosperous and the country be strong. Modern countries compete with each other in the world, and to contend for supremacy, they must first strengthen their economies, and guiding the people to maximize production is the way to strengthen the economy. China's production is backward, and the things needed for the people's lives, those produced by agriculture, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, cannot be fully supplied, and must be obtained from abroad. As for those produced by industry, not to mention the heavy industry machinery used for industry, even the amount of light industrial products imported from abroad each year is startling when examining the customs trade figures. The large outflow of cash to balance the import deficit leads to the decline of rural areas, which affects industry and commerce, and then the financial industry, and the entire economy is shrouded in a serious state of depression. The weakness of national power has become a fact known to all the people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in addition to suppressing the communists, has seen the decline of rural areas and thought of reviving them, and his planning for national economic construction can be said to be timely and to understand the true meaning of restoring the economy and restoring the nation. Agriculture and industry are the only components of production and the only sources of economic stimulus. The economic construction movement in agriculture lies in maximizing the production efficiency of our vast plains, mountains, forests, and rivers; the economic construction movement in industry lies in turning our agricultural raw materials into industrial products, and even making the machinery that makes industry possible, so that the country can supply all its needs without seeking anything from abroad, which is the ultimate goal. However, the categories are complex and must be carefully considered, prioritizing them and advancing on different paths, so that things can be easily accomplished. Now, taking the cloth used to make clothes, that is, the cotton industry, as an example, I will examine the reasons for its past decline and the direction of future construction, and then design a cotton industry network as a plan for the national economic construction movement.</p>
<p>The decline of China's cotton industry is mainly due to the inability to reduce production costs, especially in urban textile factories. Modern industries all strive to reduce production costs. The sum of production costs and raw materials is the value of its finished products. Low production costs and cheap raw materials result in lower prices for finished products. Inexpensive goods are easier to sell. However, whether a price is cheap or not is relative. When compared to something even cheaper, the cheaper one no longer seems cheap. If the value of yarn is compared to Japanese yarn, which is even cheaper, it cannot compete. In addition, natural disasters and banditry have led to deep rural bankruptcy, weak purchasing power, and people can only choose to buy cheap Japanese goods. Moreover, Chinese yarn factories are concentrated in cities because it is easier to manage funds, which is also a cause of difficulties. Analyzing it, there are the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Affected by the dumping of foreign factories in China;</p>
<p>(2) Foreign goods are dumped, and the government cannot refuse;</p>
<p>(3) Rural purchasing power is weak, and people choose to buy cheaper goods;</p>
<p>(4) Weak capital and heavy interest burden;</p>
<p>(5) Insufficient talent, unable to fully utilize technical skills;</p>
<p>(6) Outdated machinery, unable to increase production and reduce consumption;</p>
<p>(7) Too many spindles are concentrated, and Chinese merchants inevitably squeeze each other out.</p>
<p>Among these, (4), (5), and (6) are where Japanese factories in China outperform Chinese factories. Japanese factories are mostly branches of well-established and well-funded companies in Japan, and their operating funds do not rely on financial institutions, so their interest burden is minimal. Their middle and upper-level engineers have undergone extensive training and are experienced in technology. Their machinery is mostly modern, which increases production and reduces consumption. What is even more advantageous is that labor strikes are not easy to occur, because they have the protection of consular jurisdiction, and even if they do occur, they are easy to suppress and stop, so they can work with peace of mind and devote themselves to production. All of these are beyond the reach of Chinese factories. To solve this,</p>
<p>(1) and (2) are impossible due to being bound by unequal international treaties.</p>
<p>(3) Rural areas have suffered from disasters and banditry, and it is difficult to quickly restore their old prosperity, so it is impossible to force them not to buy cheap foreign goods.</p>
<p>(4), (5), and (6) belong to the entire financial and educational problems, which cannot be improved urgently.</p>
<p>The feasible and effective way is to disperse the concentrated machinery in (7) to the inland, establish factories, and use them as economic bunkers for the textile industry, clearing the fields and resisting the intrusion of foreign yarn and cloth. The textile factories in China are mostly concentrated in treaty ports. The distribution of spindles in the country is shown below:</p>
<p>Distribution of Spindles in the Country</p>
<p>Location Ownership Number of Factories Number of Spindles</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese 31 1,147,804</p>
<p>Japanese 30 1,207,284</p>
<p>British 3 184,908</p>
<p>Jiangsu Chinese 22 584,544</p>
<p>Zhejiang Chinese 3 58,120</p>
<p>Anhui Chinese 1 18,400</p>
<p>Jiangxi Chinese 1 20,480</p>
<p>Hubei Chinese 7 311,144</p>
<p>Japanese 1 24,816</p>
<p>Hunan Chinese 1 50,000</p>
<p>Total for the Yangtze River Basin 100 3,707,500</p>
<p>Shanxi Chinese 6 79,824</p>
<p>Henan Chinese 4 108,828</p>
<p>Hebei Chinese 9 293,478</p>
<p>Shandong Chinese 4 99,948</p>
<p>Japanese 6 365,380</p>
<p>Total for the Yellow River Basin 29 947,458</p>
<p>Liaoning Chinese 2 4,184</p>
<p>Japanese 4 115,680</p>
<p>Chinese 1 1,200</p>
<p>Total for the Northeast and Northwest 7 158,064</p>
<p>Total 136 4,813,022</p>
<p>According to the table above, Chinese merchants in Shanghai have more than 1,147,000 spindles. Including Japanese merchants, there are more than 2,639,000 spindles. Together with all the factories in Jiangsu Province, there are more than 3,224,000 spindles. Chinese merchants in Hankou have more than 311,000 spindles, and together with Japanese merchants, there are more than 335,000 spindles. Tianjin has about 293,000 spindles. Chinese merchants in Shandong only have more than 99,000 spindles, while Japanese merchants have more than 365,000 spindles. Therefore, the distribution of spindles in the country is concentrated in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin, except that Chinese merchants in Shandong have fewer spindles. Shanghai is particularly prominent, exceeding half of the total number of spindles of Chinese and foreign merchants in the country, and the number of spindles of Chinese merchants is also 40% of the total number of spindles of Chinese merchants in the country. In terms of the advantages of cities over the inland, they are (1) stable order, (2) active finance, (3) convenient transportation, (4) easy to find skilled workers, and (5) smooth business. In terms of their disadvantages, they are (1) high land prices, (2) heavy property taxes and other miscellaneous expenses, (3) higher wages and unstable workers, making it difficult to manage, (4) higher raw material prices, (5) lower selling prices of finished products, and (6) more intense competition among the same industry. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of urban factories listed above, although public security is better in cities than in the inland, since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the national sentiment has changed, and people are alarmed by the increasing foreign aggression. Internal wars are no longer seen, and the communist bandits are gradually being suppressed. Local governments are now able to protect production and provide convenience, reversing the situation during the warlord era. Therefore, establishing factories in the inland can be guaranteed in terms of public security, no less than in cities. In terms of business, the most important thing is the circulation of funds. Since funds have concentrated in cities, resulting in distorted prosperity, the financial industry has gradually shifted its attention to the inland, seeking to revive rural areas and promote the economy. Therefore, factories established in the inland do not have to worry about the difficulty of adjusting funds. As for the purchase and sale of cotton and yarn, and the consumption of production costs, inland factories have unique advantages over cities, which are listed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Land prices are low, about one-tenth of that in cities, which can reduce the fixed capital for establishing factories.</p>
<p>(2) Business miscellaneous expenses are lower.</p>
<p>(3) Although it is not easy to recruit skilled workers, the villagers are honest and simple. Once trained, they can always be used and develop a sense of care, and their wages are low, only two-thirds of those in cities.</p>
<p>(4) It is easy to purchase raw cotton, which can save transportation, interest, insurance, and commission fees compared to urban factories, from one to more than ten yuan per dan.</p>
<p>(5) Urban yarn factories solicit widely, and the selling price of their finished products transported and sold to the inland must be lower than that of inland factories, usually by more than four or five yuan.</p>
<p>Among the above, (1), (2), and (3) show that inland factories can save more on consumption than cities. Because land prices are low, the interest on fixed capital can be reduced. Miscellaneous expenses are lower, and labor costs are lower, which can reduce regular expenses, all of which can affect production costs and lower the price of finished products. As for (4) and (5), raw materials and sales channels are the key to developing the cotton industry, and the inland is also better than cities. Therefore, urban factories, in order to avoid the squeeze of foreign factories in China and obtain the advantages of location, must adapt to the published cotton production. Shanghai and other counties in Jiangsu Province have a total of more than 3,224,000 spindles. The cotton production in Jiangsu Province in 1934 was more than 1,664,000 dan. Most of the yarn factories in the counties are located in cotton-producing areas, where they can purchase cotton locally. Shanghai yarn factories, on the other hand, purchase cotton from other provinces to make up for the difference because the raw cotton is not enough for the needs of the spindles. Therefore, the above-mentioned cost of one to more than ten yuan per dan, which is more expensive than in the producing areas, is included in the cost of the yarn, and the price must be higher. When the price of yarn falls below the cost, the yarn factory suffers losses. Therefore, adapting to the amount of cotton produced in various places, dispersing the concentrated machinery in cities to the inland, and adding new factories according to their needs, distributing them like a network, is particularly important. Now, the national cotton production is shown below, and then the design of the cotton industry network is discussed.</p>
<p>National Cotton Production in 1934</p>
<p>Province Seed Cotton Production (dan) Province Seed Cotton Production (dan)</p>
<p>Hebei 28,836,917 Hubei 1,903,888</p>
<p>Shandong 1,324,026 Hunan 100,395</p>
<p>Shanxi 601,096 Jiangxi 33,790</p>
<p>Henan 1,022,356 Anhui 39,400</p>
<p>Shaanxi 1,004,122 Jiangsu 1,664,935</p>
<p>Total 6,787,527 Zhejiang 462,618</p>
<p>Total 2,172,533 Total 4,385,026</p>
<p>According to the table above, China's cotton-producing areas can be divided into the two major basins of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. The total output of the Yangtze River Basin is more than 4,385,000 dan, and the Yellow River Basin is more than 6,787,000 dan, which is more than 2,402,000 dan more than the Yangtze River Basin. However, the number of spindles in the Yangtze River Basin is more than 2,760,000 more than in the Yellow River Basin. Therefore, the cotton production in the Yellow River Basin is more than enough for the needs of its spindles and must be transported south for sale. The cotton production in the Yangtze River Basin is not enough to supply its spindles and must be obtained from the north. The yarn and cloth products produced in the south are also used to relieve the surplus in the northwest. Therefore, the reflective supply and demand only increases the labor of transportation and wastes useless expenses. According to economic principles, there is a need for reorganization. The way to do this is to first move the concentrated machinery to the declining cotton-producing areas, and then add new factories in the cotton-producing areas according to the national clothing needs, so that the textile industry can develop evenly, the people can obtain clothing easily, and those who live by working can easily obtain work places without being limited to one corner. Hence, there is a design for a cotton industry network. The main points are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(A) Move part of the concentrated spindles to cotton-producing areas;</p>
<p>(1) Move the concentrated spindles in cities to the inland cotton-producing areas, with a suitable number of 20,000 to 30,000 spindles per location. The location should be carefully selected by experts based on the cotton production and yarn sales situation. The construction and equipment should be simple and practical under the principle of rationalization. Form cotton industry bunkers to prevent the intrusion of foreign goods. The number of spindles to be moved by each township and the location to which they are moved are tentatively proposed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Move 600,000 spindles from Shanghai to Zhangde, Luoyang, Shanzhou, and Xuchang in Henan; Yidu County, Zhangdian, Linqing, Gaotang, and Jining in Shandong; Weinan, Xi'an, and Xianyang in Shaanxi; and Xuzhou in Jiangsu; Bengbu in Anhui; and Changde in Hunan, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Move 100,000 spindles from Hankou to Xiangyang, Shashi, and Yichang, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Move more than 100,000 spindles from Tianjin to Beiping, Baodi, Gaoyang, and Wuqiao, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Each factory should have an attached preparatory sizing factory to promote hand-weaving. When moving a small number of spindles and weaving machines to the inland, the process of reeling yarn into packages can be directly abolished. The cost of reeling yarn into packages can be used to purchase preparatory sizing machines. Fine yarn can be warped and sized to make warps, which can be supplied as raw materials for rural weaving. In areas where cloth is not woven or where old-fashioned narrow-width looms are used, efforts should be made to enable them to purchase or replace new-style iron and wood looms to promote hand-weaving. The mechanism is the same as that of power looms, only the driving force is foot power and the other is power, so that the cloth that can be woven by the weaving machine can be made. If this is the case, the yarn of the yarn factory will not be unsalable, and the cost of warping and sizing will also be lower than the wages of reeling yarn into packages, which can greatly reduce the entire production cost. The rural areas will increase production with the help of the yarn factory and benefit the economy.</p>
<p>(3) Establish a finishing, bleaching, and dyeing factory</p>
<p>Choose a location with convenient transportation and that can be connected to the spinning factory to establish a finishing, bleaching, and dyeing factory, or attach it to the nearby spinning factory. The cloth produced in the concentrated weaving area will be finished, bleached, and dyed, and then transported and sold as a group, so that the cloth made in rural areas has a place to go, and it can maintain its operations without being interrupted due to difficulties in sales, which indirectly affects yarn sales.</p>
<p>(B) Add new factories in stages according to the total amount of clothing needed nationwide.</p>
<p>Increase cotton planting according to the amount of cotton needed. The outline of the design can be found in my book "Three-Three Plan for Promoting the Cotton Industry". However, during the period of cotton industry depression, urban textile factories have found it difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone have the surplus to move their excess spindles to the inland. Therefore, the government must rely on its willingness to protect the national industry and instruct the national bank to provide assistance. The number, not counting power, is about 90,000 yuan for the construction and relocation cost of each 10,000 spindles, and the completed buildings can be used as security for the loan. The establishment of preparatory sizing factories and finishing, bleaching, and dyeing factories must also be assisted by the government. In this case, not only will the yarn factory benefit, but the recovery of rural areas will also benefit even more. If new factories are added and cotton planting is increased, it is even more necessary to use national capital to enable merchants to do it. If this is the case, the decline of urban textile factories, originally due to being squeezed by foreign factories in China, can be avoided because foreign merchants cannot establish factories in non-treaty ports. The original foreign goods were dumped, and rural purchasing power was weak, and people chose to buy cheap goods. We can compete with Japanese prices because raw material prices are low, labor costs are low, and we can meet their needs. The original weak funds and insufficient talent can also be compensated for by low land prices, reduced fixed capital, no accumulation of goods, less operating capital, lighter interest burden, and labor training, which can be used for oneself for a long time, familiar with what is done, and make up for their shortcomings. I believe that this move is an effective method to solve the difficulties of the current urban yarn factories and to develop the national cotton industry. Therefore, I have described my humble opinions for the national economic construction movement.</p>
<h3>"Fourth Bottom" Commercial Trends and Prospects</h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The extreme panic at the end of last year has continued to linger into the "fourth bottom" of this year. The reason for this is that, during the closing period of last year, besides the bankruptcies and closures, those with some remaining capacity extended their debts, which were due, by three months until the end of April this year. This move cannot be said to be a mere act of prolonging life, but rather a hope that better opportunities would arise. However, in the three months after the end of the year, we observed that the commercial situation was not more vibrant than before. Therefore, two months ago, some people were already concerned about the difficulties of this "fourth bottom."</p>
<p>Facts show us that the situation at the end of April was serious. Bank failures and store closures were as alarming as during the closing period of last year. Since we acknowledge that the source of the panic at the end of April stemmed from the end of last year, we must first trace back to the causes of last year's panic.</p>
<p>What were the biggest causes of last year's panic? We must attribute the initial and most significant stagnation to real estate. Real estate developers estimated the value of Shanghai's real estate to be 280 million, but during last year's closing period, it all stagnated. The reason for the special and superior position of this 280 million in real estate was the buying and selling and manipulation by foreign merchants. Before the rise in silver prices, foreign merchants invested funds in China, because exchange rates were unfavorable, in the purchase of real estate. These huge transactions, repeated one after another, promoted the upward trend of real estate prices and made real estate a highly profitable investment. Since real estate was generally regarded as a superior investment, various commercial sectors showed a downward trend. Financial institutions, instead of using the deposits and capital they obtained at high interest rates to support the development of various enterprises, focused solely on short-term profits and invested heavily in real estate transactions, turning a lot of liquid capital into a piece of paper deed. After the silver price soared, foreign merchants, seeing the profit in exchange rates, sold off those real estate cheaply and transported the cash back to their home countries. Chinese real estate purchasers, unaware of the safety of the situation at that time, competed to buy those real estate cheaply out of greed. Real estate did show a tendency of resurgence at that time. After this real estate changed hands, and after the foreign merchants' desire to purchase real estate decreased, the transaction plummeted. Real estate owners still intended to transfer it to buyers at the lowest price, but the reduction of silver made those real estate have fewer ways out, and real estate became stagnant. Financial institutions used capital and deposits obtained at high interest rates to purchase large amounts of real estate. After the real estate business declined, how could they not feel panic? According to newspaper reports, the recent failure of two banks in Shanghai was due to this primary cause.</p>
<p>The decline of the real estate business reduced the credit chips in Shanghai's economic society by hundreds of millions. Merchants felt very constrained in the use of loans and could not act arbitrarily in anything. When it comes to loans, people think of money shops. Money shops are dedicated to credit loans. We estimate that there are 55 money shops in Shanghai. If each shop has 300,000 in credit loans, the total will be more than 16 million. As a result of the decline of the real estate business, all financial industries, in order to use funds, had to recover the amount of loans due to maintain their position. And before domestic silk, tea, fishing, etc. have commodities, they must first have the assistance of credit loans. Now that the amount of credit loans has suddenly decreased, there is no basis for commercial activities, so where can we talk about recovery? Moreover, in the current situation shrouded in depression, commodities are significantly lacking in outlets, and if there are new plans in commerce, it is necessary to prepare capital again. Thus, the use of funds has increased, while the sources are decreasing, and the reason for the inadequacy is here.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In the closing period of last year, the above-mentioned pain was felt. Those who could not circulate in the right way had to go bankrupt. Secondly, they just postponed the debts that should be paid until the end of April. And now, what is the situation at the end of April? Everything is continuing. The result of tightening credit is forcing the business community to be in danger of being at the end of its rope. What arises in response is the small industrial and commercial credit loan of 5 million for industry and commerce. Naturally, this number is far from the number needed, but it can certainly alleviate people's hearts a lot. Among them, in the business community, there are those who must urgently deal with debts, and their strength is really insufficient. In this stalemate, there is no way except to postpone it for another three months. Therefore, we observe that the commercial trend of the "fourth bottom" is not deepening, but temporarily maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>Why do we definitively determine that the commercial trend is temporarily maintaining the status quo? Because there has been no progress in the industry in the past three months. Here, we only cite the customs trade report from January to March this year in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Year January-March, 24th year January-March, 23rd year</p>
<p>Imports 150,144,769 177,491,343</p>
<p>Exports 64,361,108 61,940,375</p>
<p>Total 124,505,877 239,431,718</p>
<p>Trade Deficit 85,783,661 115,550,968</p>
<p>What is slightly comforting to the eye seems to be the reduction in the amount of the trade deficit, but it is actually a manifestation of the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth. Looking at the above table, the import of trade in the first three months of this year will decrease by 15%, and the export will increase by a little less than 4%. The increase in exports is very small, so it will not be discussed. The reason why the trade deficit has been reduced is due to the decrease in imported goods, which is enough to show the decline in my country's purchasing power. Because at this time of rising silver prices, the price of foreign goods is cheap, and it should have a stimulating effect, but the fact is exactly the opposite of the ideal. On the one hand, it is enough to see that the impact of raising silver prices on my country's purchasing power is limited, and on the other hand, it is enough to worry about the future of the national purchasing power.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international commercial port, and the whole of China is a colony of international capitalists. Needless to say, the subtleties of international trade are enough to show the general state of the domestic industry.</p>
<p>After the credit crunch, what is the substitute for Shanghai? Many people are keeping statistics on the export of cash, so I won't copy it here. But the export of silver and the reduction of chips, we seem to feel that the exchange coupons issued by various banks seem to have an increasing trend, but the fact is like this.</p>
<p>Statistics on the amount of exchange coupons issued by various banks in Shanghai recently (unit: thousands of yuan)</p>
<p>End of March last year Chinese currency 360,902 Foreign currency 3,098 Total 364,000</p>
<p>End of February this year Chinese currency 394,429 Foreign currency 3,571 Total 398,000</p>
<p>End of March last year Chinese currency 311,154 Foreign currency 2,846 Total 314,000</p>
<p>According to the above, the amount of exchange coupons issued by various banks in Shanghai has increased very little. Based on the above argument, the lack of currency is no different from the situation at the end of last year. Although real estate developers once had the idea of issuing real estate circulating coupons in order to break the dullness of the credit crunch and find a way out for real estate, it was not successful. Therefore, the stagnation of real estate is as it was, the lack of cash is as it was, and the lack of industrial progress is as it was. The commercial trend of the "fourth bottom" is only temporarily maintaining the status quo!</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Breaking this depressing phenomenon is what anyone expects. We will start with the most important reason mentioned in the first section, and we feel that the rationalization of domestic industries is really an indestructible principle. The decline in social purchasing power is due to unreasonable production, which leads to poverty. The fundamental reason for the lack of cash is also due to the trade deficit. Everyone thinks that the lack of cash is due to the export of cash, and the export of cash is due to the purchase of silver by the United States. In fact, if China were not a country with a trade deficit, why would the power to transport cash for export be in the hands of foreign merchants. Because foreign merchants' authority in Shanghai's capital sector is entirely based on their own national interests, they ignore China's interests. The sharp rise and fall of the real estate business is one example. Therefore, to transfer the authority of foreign merchants in the financial sector to China, there is no way except to revive our own industries.</p>
<p>The financial sector should pay attention to the principle of coexistence and common prosperity between itself and the industry, and must not take its own selfish interests as the starting point of its business and create past mistakes. A few years ago, financial institutions were engaged in the investment of public bonds and real estate, and some people had already shouted loudly that it was an act of digging their own graves. Unfortunately, this was correct. Therefore, for the future of the financial industry, there is no way out except to support industrial development.</p>
<p>The "fourth bottom" has passed by fluke. The future outlook is something that people in our business community should pay attention to together. If we think that the "fourth bottom" has passed and we can relax, then our future outlook is dark.</p>

<h3>Finance The Interbank Loan Rate is Slightly Looser, Sunday Market is Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. The market should have been deserted. However, the foreign interbank rate has become looser. The morning and afternoon markets were both 12%, but the content was very tense, and there was still no possibility of relaxing. It is probably difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. As usual on Sundays, there is no important news to record. In interbank bill transactions, 3.4 million were transferred in the morning market, more than 400,000 were newly transacted, and more than 100,000 were transacted in the afternoon market. The small general meeting traded 600,000 to 700,000. Banks did not collect or deliver. Money shops collected and delivered more than 18 million foreign public bills. There was no collection or delivery of foreign drafts. There was no inflow or outflow of banknotes. Remittances from various sources amounted to 150,000 to 60,000. In the auxiliary currency market, the price of Guangdong small dollars was 733 yuan and 80 cents in the morning market and 734 yuan in the afternoon market, an increase of 20 cents between the two markets. 95,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Jiangnan small dollars was 835 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets. Only 2,000 jiao were traded in the morning market, and there was no transaction in the afternoon market. Copper coins were stable at 337,000 wen. 18,982 strings of wen were traded, equivalent to 6,800 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Were Slightly Better, Up 12 Cents to Half a Yuan Last Week, 96 Transactions Were Exclusively More, Prices Were Only Around 8 Cents</h3>
<p>Last week, from April 29th to May 4th, after the settlement of the futures contract at the Yishang Securities Exchange in April, the environmental situation was unremarkable. The so-called international loan is still just a pie in the sky. The so-called Sino-Japanese friendship is still obscure. The government maintains finance, and the "fourth bottom" can be overcome, but it is not a fundamental solution. The United States' silver policy is still difficult to reverse. Various situations have not changed slightly. Therefore, the ups and downs of various bonds are almost imperceptible. However, the 96 public bond itself has suddenly undergone a substantial change. It is found that before the 18th year of the Republic of China, there were still a large number of old tickets that had not been exchanged for new tickets. Since May 3rd of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it was formally announced that old tickets could not be settled on the exchange. The number of old tickets circulating on the market, excluding the Japanese gold part, was only 30 to 40 million. Recently, from May 1st, it was announced that old tickets could be used and treated the same as new tickets. The purpose of the shorts is to use these old tickets of about 10 million yuan as a tool for attack. The longs believe that they have detected very few and that it is not difficult to buy them all up. They also believe that the government has not forgotten the old tickets and that the reorganization will eventually be realized. In short, speculative psychology has its own basis. The shorts take advantage of the fact that the principal and interest are not available and that the ticket amount has increased. The longs take advantage of the fact that the market value is very low and easy to absorb. Hedging transactions are also very profitable. The two sides are competing with each other, so a huge wave has arisen. It is rumored that most of the small ones this time were caused by the shorts, but they have not been punished. People suspect that there may be a second attack, and their tool may be to use the suspension of the auction as a threat. This matter is of great importance and cannot be rashly. It is also easy to start and difficult to stop. It can only be temporary and not permanent. Therefore, there are still many storms ahead. Judging from the fact that the current account this month is 11 to 12 million and the current account next month is 5 to 6 million, the market price is not easy to set. Moreover, it is inevitable that counterfeit tickets will be found during settlement, and no concrete measures have been planned yet. The market price has gone through. It was slightly better by 23 cents to half a yuan on Monday. It was stable on Tuesday and continued to be better by 12 cents. Transactions were very quiet on both days. On Wednesday, the 96 old tickets were generally used, and a market announcement was seen. It fell sharply by 67 cents. Other bonds also fell by 34 cents. On Thursday, the 96 was slightly stable, because there were few sellers temporarily, but transactions still accounted for the majority. On Friday, large households sold wildly again, and the 96 fell by about 7 cents again. The front line of retail investors also showed signs of shaking. On Saturday, there was a sudden reaction, rebounding by several cents, but since the rebound was weak, it was not a change in the situation. Because a lot of old tickets were delivered, the market price should still have a rebound. The result of the market price for a week is that ordinary bonds are mostly slightly better by 12 cents to about half a yuan, and the 96 is also only about 8 cents. The total number of transactions was 53.344 million yuan, and the 96 accounted for 27.28 million yuan, still accounting for more than half of the total amount.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton American Cotton Brokers Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market was very inactive. The price rose and fell by one pound. Then, due to purchases by counterparts and brokers, the shorts resisted, and there were not many buyers. At the same time, silver prices were strong, and spot goods were tight. There was little movement in the South, so the price trended upward. However, new buyers did not surge in, and counterparts were still waiting and seeing. It is rumored here that the four parties in Pakistan are very strong. The closing was firm. Spot goods rose by five pounds, and futures rose by three to ten pounds. British cotton spot goods rose by four points, and futures rose by two or three points. Indian cotton was weak due to sales of July contracts and clearing of long positions by domestic operators. Pingguo rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1 to 2 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee recently. The original telegram is recorded on the left (3rd electricity).</p>

<h3>Grain Prices of Various Rice Vary</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, various rice sources still only arrived at more than 20 numbers (more than 4,000 stones of goods in total). The sales market also continued to ship, and the market was not much higher or lower. Only the sellers tightened up due to the scarcity of goods. Nan Gang early rice continued to have intentions in the store stomach, slightly lifting the fish. The situation of Su Tong japonica rice was stable. Although the various late rice seems to have stopped, fortunately, Zhanhuo Baozi Wei Haiwei helped to take 1,000 packages, which relied on raising it by several points. Yin Biang Yuan is still similar. Changbang white japonica rice 3.90, Tuo Lai Temple 2.50, Si Jing True Special 2 1.25, and True Special Geng 13.50, Zhu Jing early rice 2.40, Chong Gu True Special 3.18</p>

The middle and secondary continued to transform, and the price was high. The goods of the middle and secondary were dull. Early thin rice arrived less and sold well, and the price was close to the corner. The price of Bai Yuan was stable, and the prices of the rest of the goods stood firm.</p>

<h3>The National Policy of Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>The newspaper's current affairs commentary on October 1 discusses the prerequisites for promoting health education in three paragraphs. First, it discusses the urgency of health education from the perspective of the national situation and folk customs. Then, it discusses the difficulty of promoting health education, which depends on the guidance and cooperation of scientific medicine. Finally, it describes the inability of scientific medicine to penetrate into society and its remedial measures. On the whole, it has been recognized that scientific medicine is sufficient to save the country and must be penetrated into the whole people. How true this is!</p>
<p>If we start from health education, we must first seek how to make scientific medicine universal to society. What I focus on is a further step, namely, the so-called national medicine and health, so that modern countries can finally solve the problem in the general direction of law and politics, and whether there is a need to solve it. To say it again in a cycle, I am afraid that without a clear solution to the medical and health problem, it will definitely not be possible to achieve the goal of making scientific medicine universal to society in the near future.</p>
<p>Looking at modern independent countries, their policies on medicine and health are never ambiguous. Even in East Asia, Japan, Turkey, and Siam have already solved the problem clearly. As for those who are only good at propaganda policies, they are only governing colonies in Europe. Colonial policies have great power in their hands, and they avoid coercive disturbances to the people's livelihood habits. Therefore, new and old medicine can coexist without conflicting with each other. We do not need to look far at India and the Philippines, but we can also look at the current situation in the concession. They beautifully call it gradual assimilation. Gradual assimilation is certainly not without effect. However, I am ashamed and deeply worried that the policy of the Republic of China is hesitant.</p>
<p>What is the national policy of medicine and health? It is that the state should recognize scientific medicine as a physician and have a plan to gradually reform old medicine. If this can be done, then there will be a consistent spirit in legislation, and there must be certain steps in administration. From the perspective of legislation alone, there should first be a physician law to confirm the qualifications of physicians to correct misunderstandings. For the adjustment of the modern national conditions, the trial implementation law can be changed, and the provisional regulations for managing old medicine can be assisted. From the administrative point of view, there should be an educational policy for rapid production of physicians. We cannot just sing high-profile tunes and cling to the preconceived ideas of Europe and the United States, so as to play the zither with glued pillars, and say that physicians must improve their level.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to tell the policy makers that if we try to solve the national policy of medicine and health in the form of a general petition of the whole people, then this saying will exist a hundred years later, and this saying will exist a thousand years later. Those who want to reach the procedures of modern countries will definitely not be possible in the near future. I say this because I have a basis. Don't you see that two thousand years ago, witches were the formal doctors? And in today's Shanghai, where all nations come and go, incantations to cure diseases and prayers to ward off distant illnesses are prevalent among ignorant couples. How effective are the theories of disease in the Suwen Ling Shu and the theories of medicine in the Qianjin Bencao? To say it is universal is still not so. The difficulty of reforming the heart is like this. Therefore, major national policies are decided between two or three people in the court, not between thousands of people on the roadside. History tells me this. How can it be forced? Confucius said, "The superior acts, the inferior imitates." Guanzi said, "Politics precedes education." (When Japan was restored, Okubo and Itagaki and other heroes had a one-night talk with Mr. Nagayo Senzai, and the proposal to reform Chinese medicine was decided. Mr. Okubo said, "For matters related to science, everything is based on science." Those who are knowledgeable like this should prosper when they are in power. Therefore, I believe that those who want the awakening of the whole people must first have the awakening of those in power. If the policy of the court is not decided, the bad habits of the masses will never be eliminated. It can be asserted.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Oral Hygiene in Schools in Various Countries (4)</h3>
<p>— Situ Xue</p>
<p>Oral Hygiene in German Schools</p>
<p>Following Mr. Fisher in England's advocacy for mandatory dental check-ups and treatment for schoolchildren, Ernst Jessen of Sfrasboury, Germany, also initiated a school dental clinic within three years. He vigorously promoted the importance of dental care for children, starting in 1888. This marked the beginning of school dental clinics in Germany. However, this movement did not initially generate significant influence, so it did not achieve good results immediately. Fortunately, Jessen persevered with his unwavering spirit, opening school dental clinics while diligently educating the public. He repeatedly published the results of oral examinations of schoolchildren, stating that tooth decay had spread to over 95%. He argued that if prevention and eradication were possible, it would have a significant impact on the physical development of children in the future. Gradually, his enthusiastic advocacy was recognized by other scholars. Within a few years, oral examination results were being published in various regions. In 1894, Paul Ritter, a great figure in German oral hygiene, explained the importance of teeth and oral hygiene for national health to the Berlin Internal Medicine Society. As a result, this issue, which had been previously neglected by the medical community, gained widespread attention.</p>
<p>Approximately ten years after Jessen established the school dental clinic, other cities also began to implement similar programs. Kohler also strongly advocated for the necessity of school dental clinics. He obtained the approval of the municipal authorities, and on August 7, 1902, the city budget approved an equipment fee of 1,250 marks and an annual operating expense of 1,200 marks to establish a municipal school dental clinic.</p>
<p>Although the establishment of school dental clinics gradually became noteworthy, economic constraints in various cities led to their inability to fully implement them. By 1909, there were only thirty school dental clinics in Germany.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1909, another opportunity arose. The Central Committee for School Hygiene in Germany (Das Deutsche Zentralkomit Fur Zahnpflege in den Schulen) was established, becoming the center of the oral hygiene movement. Dental professionals and the public worked together to promote the importance of oral hygiene and establish school dental clinics in various regions. At that time, W. Friedmann, considering the economic aspect, initiated the so-called subscription-based approach (Abonnementssyatem). If implemented this way, it would be easier to establish municipal school dental clinics. Therefore, the Central Committee for School Dental Hygiene in Germany considered this approach to be highly suitable for the current situation and vigorously promoted it. This proved effective. In the spring of 1909, there were only thirty clinics established, but by 1913, the number suddenly increased to over two hundred.</p>
<p>After the publication of the subscription-based approach, Mannheim also introduced the so-called free choice system (Freizeahnarzwahlu) in the same year. Later, Rantrcwcs advocated for a systematic treatment system. Therefore, the school dental hygiene system currently implemented in Germany can be roughly divided into four types, with the following content:</p>
<p>(1) Strasbourg Style, or Jassen Style: This is the method implemented by Jassen in collaboration with the municipal authorities since 1902. The principle is to provide free treatment to all children in the city. First, the children's teeth are examined. The results of the examination are filled out on a reservation form and sent to the children's parents, who are encouraged to come to the school dental clinic. All children who come to the clinic, whether elementary school or kindergarten children, receive oral cleaning. According to Jassen's report on the results over ten years, 63,489 children were treated, 65,462 teeth were filled, and 6,737 teeth were extracted. Twelve percent of elementary school children receive oral cleaning annually.</p>
<p>(2) Subscription Style: In this method, each child prepays or pays monthly a one-mark subscription fee to the municipal school dental clinic for treatment. If there are two or more children in the same family, each pays half a mark. Consequently, all dental treatment for the children is handled by the municipal clinic. In 1910, the Duisburg municipal school dental clinic began implementing this method. Friedmann took office as director, supervising all matters, vigorously promoting the program, and publishing the actual results of oral examinations and the alarming state of tooth decay in children through news reports and lectures. As a result, among the 33,000 schoolchildren in the city, 19,400, or 59%, subscribed. The average subscription fee paid per person was 1.08 marks. The total subscription fee paid to the city by the 19,400 people was 15,520 marks. The municipal authorities only needed to subsidize about 5,000 marks annually. Therefore, the municipal school dental clinic was easily maintained and received the support of the Central Committee for School Hygiene.</p>
<p>(3) Free Choice System: This is an agreement jointly established by the city of Mannheim and the city's dental association, based on the principle of so-called free choice. For the implementation of dental care for schoolchildren, the municipal authorities annually allocated 300 marks for consultation fees and 25,000 marks for treatment fees. The consultation procedure is implemented according to the class order in each school, and all examinations must be completed within a certain period. After the children's dental condition has been examined, it is indicated who should be treated or who needs to be given appropriate treatment. The children or their parents freely choose a dental professional for treatment. The treatment fee is calculated and collected by the dental committee every six months based on the treatment records. Although this method can be implemented, the total treatment fee in 1913 was 29,113 marks, exceeding the budget. The expenditure amount was revised in 1914, increasing to 30,000 marks.</p>
<p>(4) Systematic Treatment System: This is the ideal school dental hygiene method advocated by Alfred Kantrwicz. This method first examines the oral condition of schoolchildren and then advises their families to have their children receive dental treatment. All treated children, from first to seventh grade, receive free treatment. The children receiving treatment are divided into eight or ten groups, proceeding sequentially from number one in each grade to complete their treatment. This system systematically treats all schoolchildren in the city at the expense of the city.</p>
<p>Although there are the aforementioned four methods for operating school dental facilities in Germany, the appropriate system is adopted based on local conditions and implemented with the opinions of those involved in guidance. Before the Great War in Europe, in 1915, there were 229 school dental clinics in Germany. Only one-tenth of them temporarily stopped during the war, but they soon returned to their original state. Although Germany's territory shrunk after the war, there were still 156 clinics in existence, all of which were very active, no different from before the war. The country's attention to the oral hygiene of schoolchildren is evident.</p>

<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(46) Adenoid Hypertrophy</p>
<p>In my previous issue (45), when I was discussing nasal obstruction, I mentioned that in adolescence, obstruction can easily lead to developmental disabilities. In other words, adenoid hypertrophy has a direct and close relationship with the development of various parts of the body. Therefore, I will now specifically discuss all aspects of this condition in detail.</p>
<p>Adenoid hypertrophy, also known as hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsils, is caused by the hypertrophy and proliferation of the pharyngeal tonsils. It occurs in the upper part of the posterior wall of the nasal cavity, often obstructing the posterior nasal choanae from the upper rear. It appears as an uneven tumor with a reddish luster. This disease commonly occurs in children aged five to fifteen. It is rare after adulthood because the pharyngeal tonsils can atrophy due to physiological regression and degeneration in adulthood. Repeated acute inflammation, adenoid disease, and tuberculosis can also often be predisposing factors for this condition.</p>
<p>The most prominent main symptoms of this disease can be distinguished as four:</p>
<p>(1) Oral Breathing due to Nasal Obstruction: The posterior nasal choanae of patients with this disease are often closed or narrowed by hypertrophied and proliferated adenoids, leading to nasal obstruction. Since nasal breathing is obstructed, they naturally have to resort to oral breathing to compensate for the lack of respiration. After prolonged oral breathing, the patient's appearance changes, becoming a foolish-looking appearance, which is the so-called adenoid facies. That is, the mouth is often half-open, the nasolabial folds disappear, saliva often drools from the corners of the mouth, nasal discharge also often flows out, the nose and mouth are prone to redness or eczema, the palate is highly arched, and the arrangement of teeth is often irregular. The development of the chest is also often incomplete. Therefore, the patient's appearance is very similar to that of a dullard. As a result of oral breathing, inflammation of the respiratory tract mucosa can often occur. During sleep, sounds are often made and it is difficult to sleep soundly. Sometimes it can also cause dizziness, heaviness, headache, and other reflexive neurological symptoms. If patients with this condition are infants, nasal breathing is impossible and often leads to difficulties in taking food, resulting in malnutrition. Nocturnal enuresis and night terrors in children are also often caused by this condition.</p>
<p>(2) Changes in Voice: Pronunciation is often incorrect, often a congested nasal voice. Therefore, it is often difficult to speak or read.</p>
<p>(3) Incomplete Ventilation of the Eustachian Tube: If the ventilation of the Eustachian tube is incomplete, it can easily lead to otitis media and hearing impairment.</p>
<p>(4) Incomplete Development of Intellectual Education: Because this disease mostly occurs in children, it often leads to nasal attention deficit disorder. This symptom easily hinders intellectual education, causing the patient to be mostly dull. Their academic performance in school is also not necessarily excellent. Therefore, the educational authorities in European and American countries pay close attention to this disease. There are often regulations in schools that require children to be examined by doctors. Because this disease has a close relationship with the development of the body and the development of education.</p>
<p>The prognosis of this disease is absolutely good. After careful examination by a specialist doctor and a decision is made, surgery can be performed to eliminate all obstacles and restore health. This type of surgery is completely risk-free.</p>
<p>I have specially asked cartoonist Mr. Xu Yueling to draw two pictures for me. One is a healthy and disease-free appearance, and the other is an appearance with adenoid hypertrophy. The symptoms I have described have all been portrayed. Readers will be able to understand it more clearly.</p>

<h3>Pain Relief Medicine (13)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Rheumatic pain is a common problem. First, let's talk about prevention methods. Even if the treatment methods are extraordinary, they are not as good as prevention. The first urgent task in preventing the occurrence or recurrence of this disease is to avoid exposing the body to cold and dampness. Therefore, clothes should be kept warm at all times. Secondly, pay attention to general hygiene in diet and daily life to increase the body's resistance. Starting from summer, being able to wipe the body with cold water once a day to strengthen the skin is also a way to prevent rheumatism. When the climate is suitable, often taking walks or doing appropriate exercises in fresh air is also beneficial. Chronic inflammation of the nose, throat, and mouth should be treated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The first important thing in treating rheumatic pain is to rest in bed quietly. By doing so, one can reduce pain and two can allow the myocarditis to gradually heal. As for the drugs for treating rheumatic pain, sodium salicylate should be the first choice. This drug should be taken with alkaline drugs such as potassium bicarbonate. For local treatment of painful joints, the first thing is to make the joints completely suitable for rest, such as placing a soft pillow at the bent part of the joint to gently support the painful joint.</p>
<p>For mild pain, wrap it with cotton and rest for a few days and it will be completely healed. For severe pain, wrapping it with magnesium sulfate water-soaked cotton is also acceptable. Other plasters can also be used under medical guidance. Hot and humid compresses are also of considerable value. Patients must not try opium or morphine to anesthetize the nerves and relieve pain, because a little carelessness can lead to entrapment. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Mantis Seed</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiguo</p>
<p>Mantis seed is the common name. That is, there are white raised objects in the oral cavity of infants. Most are located near the gums on the left and right cheeks or on the gums. No records of this disease have been seen in modern medical books, so there is no way to name it. I used to not understand what the disease was. A few years ago, a friend's child had this condition. An old woman from the village used a silver needle to pick out white objects about the size of soybeans, about a teaspoon's worth. The friend brought it to my place and asked me to examine it. I examined it and knew it was fatty tissue. When placed in ether, it can be dissolved and contracted. When examined under a microscope, it was all fatty tissue cells and there were no white blood cells or other impurities in between. It can be seen that it is not caused by inflammation. I immediately gave the friend an antiseptic and told him to apply it to the wound. There were no changes afterward. However, I often encounter cases where inflammation or suppuration of the oral wall is caused by cutting mantis seed.</p>
<p>I think the mantis seed is formed by the proliferation of fatty tissue under the oral mucosa. The proliferation is probably caused by the vacuum generated in the oral cavity when infants suckle. Vacuum action is enough to cause tissue proliferation, and fat composition is the easiest to proliferate. In pathology, there is a theory that tissue proliferation is caused by vacuum action, which is the so-called Hypertrphie ex vacuo.</p>
<p>Infants with mantis seed do not have other adverse symptoms, but they often cry and refuse to breastfeed. Probably the raised mantis seed on both cheeks is enough to hinder their sucking action. It seems logical that they cry because they are hungry. Therefore, after it is removed, the crying stops immediately.</p>
<p>The world regards cutting mantis seed as not very dangerous. Probably the fact is that only a small number of people actually develop inflammation and suppuration. At most, it bleeds. This may be due to the self-cleaning effect of the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, there is no record of this disease in modern medical books. (I have not seen it in pathology.) Could it be that European children do not have this disease? I think European and American children mostly use milk bottles to suckle, and the sucking action is easier. Children in our country who suffer from this disease may be caused by the mother's difficulty in leaking milk or insufficient milk. Children have to suck hard to cause it. However, I heard people say that only people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang know about this disease, and most people in other provinces do not know about it. This is even more strange. Also, the method of picking out mantis seeds is to use a flat silver needle. First, slightly break the surface of the mucous membrane, and then extract the colored objects from below. (The shape is like small sesame-sized particles combined together, probably like the eggs of mantises, hence the name.) Mostly done by village women or midwives. Those with good skills can avoid bleeding much, and it takes very little time, so it can also be called a special skill.</p>
<p>If children of relatives and friends have this disease, I often tell them to let it go naturally. It can also recede on its own soon. Therefore, children with this disease do not need to be treated by cutting to avoid the danger of inflammation and suppuration.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(57) Osteomalacia</p>
<p>(Osteomalacia)</p>
<p>(Q) What is osteomalacia?</p>
<p>(A) This is a disease in which the lime content of the bones disappears and atrophies, resulting in abnormally soft bones.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of osteomalacia?</p>
<p>(A) Like rickets, it is caused by nutritional disorders, especially vitamin D deficiency. So it can also be called adult rickets.</p>
<p>(Q) At what age does this disease usually occur?</p>
<p>(A) Most occur between the ages of thirty and fifty; but some occur in adolescence and old age.</p>
<p>(Q) Does gender matter?</p>
<p>(A) Women are more likely to get it: especially pregnant women and women in the puerperium are most likely to get it.</p>
<p>(Q) Is it related to the seasons?</p>
<p>(A) More in winter and early spring, less in summer.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the occurrence of osteomalacia related to geographical distribution?</p>
<p>(A) In many places, there is indeed a relationship. It is more common in North China, India, Europe, and inland Japan.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms occur after developing this disease?</p>
<p>(A) There are symptoms such as pain, motor impairment, bone shape changes, and muscle weakness.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of pain?</p>
<p>(A) Pain is the initial symptom. In the pelvic bones, waist, back, limbs, especially the thighs, etc. There is also tenderness in this area.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of motor impairment?</p>
<p>(A) Motor impairment is caused by pain or changes in bone shape. Especially in the pelvic bones, the articular bones are obvious. When walking, it cannot be stable and is very slow, or in a staggering or hopping state.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of bone shape change?</p>
<p>(A) The shapes of bones such as the pelvis, rib cage, and spine all change.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the pelvis deformed?</p>
<p>(A) In the sacral promontory, it becomes bulging due to the pressure of the weight of the torso; the sides of the pelvis also sink inward due to the pressure of the femoral head. As a result, the pelvic inlet is narrowed into a heart shape.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the rib cage deformed?</p>
<p>(A) The ribs descend laterally: the sternum is very bulging, so the shape of the rib cage becomes an irregular odd shape.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the spine deformed?</p>
<p>(A) The upper half of the spine is kyphotic or kyphotic and scoliosis. At the same time, the head is flexed forward, so the patient's height is shortened.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any changes in the bones of the limbs, face, skull, etc.?</p>
<p>(A) The bones of many parts do not change much.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (50)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Complications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Section 1: Tuberculous Meningitis</p>
<p>This disease is most common in children, less so in adults, especially in children aged one to five. Its clinical symptoms can generally be divided into three stages: prodromal, irritative, and paralytic. In the prodromal stage, there are often no obvious symptoms, making diagnosis very difficult. Children who are usually very lively may become temperamental, lose interest in playing, lose their appetite, and sleep more. Adults may experience headaches, but otherwise feel nothing. This state can sometimes last for several days. However, once the irritative symptoms appear, their condition changes completely. At this time, there is severe headache, mental irritability, and unease with light and sound; nausea, vomiting, teeth grinding, and gradual stiffening of the neck also occur, and the skin becomes hypersensitive, with even light touch causing extreme pain; localized or generalized muscle tension, rigidity, and spasms occur, even epileptic-like seizures. The abdomen is sunken; the pulse is rapid, but as intracranial pressure increases, it slows down, and the temperature rise is not very high, with temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius being rare. Breathing is rapid, the patient loses consciousness and becomes comatose; facial and ocular nerve paralysis occurs, eventually leading to death. The duration of this disease, from the prodromal stage to death, is usually about four weeks; however, if intracranial pressure phenomena occur rapidly, the duration is shorter. Diagnosis of this disease is very difficult in the prodromal period; however, if the various clinical symptoms have become very pronounced, it can be roughly surmised. Whether the patient has a pre-existing tuberculous condition is also a very noteworthy matter, and whether the tuberculin reaction is positive or negative is very helpful for the diagnosis of this disease. The most valuable proof, of course, is the lumbar puncture! The cerebrospinal fluid is transparent, slightly turbid, but never purulent; the pressure is high, and the protein level is increased, with both red and white blood cells increased; the demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the fluid is the only evidence of this disease. Examination of the blood picture is of little value here. The prognosis of this disease is very poor, and examples of recovery are almost non-existent. In addition to the usual symptomatic treatment, lumbar puncture seems to be helpful for high intracranial pressure; however, it has no effect on the overall disease.</p>

<h3>James Joyce</h3>
<p>— Libo</p>
<p>James Joyce was a portrayer of the lives of Dublin's petty bourgeoisie. The appearance of his representative work, "Ulysses," was a strange phenomenon in the history of modern literature; it confirmed Joyce's highest position in literature. Joyce's imitators are all over the world, and annotations and worship of Joyce have tightened the nerves of the entire civic literature, and the term "Joycean" has become the most popular literary term.</p>
<p>Joyce was born in Ireland in 1881. He came from a family with a full education. He studied at a Jesuit seminary and Dublin University. Because he could not tolerate the corrupt homeland of the Irish citizens, he fled to the continent. As an impoverished English teacher, he roamed all over Europe. His later depiction of the civic psyche and the neologisms of his writing were deeply rooted during this roaming period.</p>
<p>Most importantly, during this period, he delved into the great currents of Western European culture and felt the influence of the most typical and central artists of the world's citizens. On the one hand, he was influenced by the extreme psychologicalism of Henry James and Marcel Proust, and on the other hand, he was infected by the constructivist cubism specially manifested in Parisian painting. These are the most important factors that constitute his later special style. However, the "Irish Literary Renaissance" movement in his homeland also strongly influenced him. His first collection of poems, "Chamber Music," is almost entirely an imitation of the great poet Yeats and his group of the "Renaissance" school, except for being slightly stricter and slightly harder.</p>
<p>By the time his first work, "Dubliners," was published, Joyce had largely broken away from the romantic tradition of the "Renaissance" poets and leaned towards the world's realists, imitating Flaubert, Maupassant, and George Moore.</p>
<p>Technically, although Joyce became a cosmopolitan, the object of his depiction, the foundation of his success, was almost entirely the life and psychology of the petty bourgeoisie of Dublin. "Dubliners" is entirely a sketch of the gray, narrow, material life and the capture of the melancholic soul of the people of Dublin. The essence of Joyce's biological pessimistic thought can be seen in outline in this first prose.</p>
<p>"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" is the author's autobiography. The protagonist Dedalus is the author himself. This book is a liquidation of his Irish education, but it has more Irish color and is more youthful and romantic than "Dubliners." The creative method of this book is still somewhat simple and lacks originality. His original style was not fully established until the publication of "Ulysses."</p>
<p>As everyone knows, "Ulysses" is a strange book. It uses 732 pages of large space to record only twenty-four hours of the lives of three people in Dublin. It is a famous blasphemous novel and also a famous difficult book to read. In the UK, it was initially banned from publication. It was completed in 1921 and published in 1922. The first person to appreciate this book and advocate and introduce it was a very wealthy American scholar. Other people rarely felt interested in this book. In a forest of endless language, slashing through thorns, one can only discover some worthless trivia and accidental images. Isn't it only for people with excessive fat? Who needs it?</p>
<p>"Ulysses" is the culmination of Joyce's creative activity and also its end. For more than ten years after "Ulysses," he did not write anything worth noting.</p>
<p>In Joyce's works, vulgar things are rampant. The people in "Dubliners" are men and women without passion and full of self-interest. In "Ulysses," Blum is vulgar, and his wife Marion is also a vulgar woman with only physical desires. She thinks of the artist Dedalus, but what she needs is not his brain, but his white flesh. The Dedalus who appears in "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" and also in "Ulysses" is a self-portrait of the author, but he is just a vulgar modern Hamlet. Obscene, cowardly, lewd, and hesitant are the characteristics of Joyce's characters. Therefore, Latteck said: "Joyce regards taking pictures of feces through a microscope as the artist's task. For him, humanity is an unclean earthworm in [illegible]."</p>
<p>Why does Joyce see the human world as so ugly and disgusting? First, his social existence determined that he could only see these. Through gray glass, you can see gray objects. Similarly, through a decadent and declining psychology, you can only see the negation of humanity. Secondly, his kind of indiscriminate shorthand-style realism and unselective psychological depiction further helped him distort reality. He saw many superficial accidental images that had no interrelationship, but he could not grasp the essence of the human world, could not see the most fundamental opportunities for the masses of people, did not understand the basic clues of development, and did not know the trends of the world. In this way, of course, there are only worthless characters and cluttered psychology in his works.</p>
<p>The world is so vast, but his vision is so narrow. Therefore, in order to kill his leisure time, he had to grope into every dark corner of consciousness and subconsciousness, to caress every small part of his "inner experience." Moreover, in order to decorate his empty content, he worked hard to create new words (Word Coinage). He loved to use many unprintable words. He often connected many words together. In "Ulysses," there is not a single punctuation mark in the entire forty-five pages. The strangeness of form reaches its extreme.</p>
<p>Joyce's peculiar form is closely linked to his empty content, and is unrelated to literature. Similarly, his microscopic method, his method of "realizing consciousness" and "internal monologue," and even his naturalistic technique of depicting the outside world, are not beneficial to literature because they all have static and artificial natures, which are contrary to literature, which should have fresh content and lofty purpose.</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Liu Baiyu</p>
<p>In the hazy dawn, the avenue was white and nothing could be seen clearly, only a row of willows drew a few gray shadows in the air.</p>
<p>The cock crowed twice—in the fields, one or two figures disappeared into the bottom of the trees.</p>
<p>"Goo... Goo..." A cart approached from the other end of the avenue, looking like a black beetle crawling in the misty fog. The [cart] was also like the teacher in the Zhang family private school, taking deep breaths on the slope every early morning... Shoo... Hiss... On the large nostrils, there was a strange sound, raising its head and striding with rough legs.</p>
<p>Zhang Yueting, from the west end of the village, got up to stretch his legs as usual, but today, looking at the ponds and ponds of rice paddies, there was not the slightest smile. "No money in my pocket"—this is really worrying. He was walking with his head down in a figure-eight pattern. The red glass ball on his melon-skin hat flashed in the dim dawn. Coincidentally, the cart came swaying along. It broke his contemplation, and he swept a glance with a disgusted look.</p>
<p>The person on the shaft of the cart squeezed the dry branches and whipped the donkey's butt. Behind... behind, a woman, with a pretty face, reflected on the blue cloth shirt, even whiter. He wiped the blurriness from the corner of his eye with effort, thinking in his heart, "Is... is the cart of the old Li family from Xiao Wangzhuang. That time, I wanted to knock two coins to spend. I almost made it... Well, today... Hmph."</p>
<p>He smiled slightly.</p>
<p>Zhang Yueting forgot that the soles of his feet were [torn]. He ran two steps and shouted with that mute voice,</p>
<p>"Stop the cart there... stop the cart there."</p>
<p>The cart pulled the reins, the donkey wagged its tail and spat out a breath.</p>
<p>"You dare to run a cart on the motor road. What a great courage... Where are you from? Take the small road, don't you know!" With both hands on his waist, he was full of energy.</p>
<p>"Okay, raise your hand... We really have something urgent."</p>
<p>"No... No, you have to understand that the motor road in that village is under the protection of that village... No, police station..."</p>
<p>While they were shouting, the fog disappeared, and a red sun came out from the east. People from the village... passersby, formed a circle, squeezing... squeezing. Children who had just crawled out of bed also ran to watch the fun. Everyone was silent. Everyone knew what was going on—the woman in the cart was so scared that her face was as yellow as the [donkey's].</p>
<p>More than half an hour later—he whispered a few words to the driver, and he waved his hand, making a scene to the surroundings,</p>
<p>"I'm going with him... I'm going with him."</p>
<p>A storm subsided, the sun shone on the surface of each pond, shaking out several silver snake-like rays of light, and rows of willows swayed.</p>
<p>At mealtime! Zhang Yueting came back from the market, carrying a big fish in one hand and half a bottle of Shaoxing wine in the other, smiling with a spring breeze on his face.</p>

<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>Spring break has begun.</p>
<p>Although our school is not big, it's a private small school! Two two-story buildings. But usually, a [something] binds the children together, as if the gray and white walls can talk. But now, now it's spring break, so cold and quiet, like an ancient temple in the deep mountains. So lonely, I sat in the "faculty office," quietly listening to the ticking of the clock on the wall. The lonely cold air enveloped me, and my whole body shivered.</p>
<p>"Have a cigarette"!</p>
<p>Faint wisps of smoke, from my mouth and nostrils, gracefully emerged, like a few small green dragons, swimming. But it immediately disintegrated and disappeared!</p>
<p>It only makes me feel more lonely!</p>
<p>"Yes! I'd better read a few pages of a book"!</p>
<p>But just as I opened the book, the door knocker rang "dong, dong, dong." Seeming to be happy, my footsteps were so quick, I ran out to open the door.</p>
<p>The person who came in was a young girl, her face dark, her body so strong, her hair in a "bob" style, not permed. She was wearing basketball shoes...</p>
<p>As I was pondering, she called out to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. ×,"</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>I gave her a suspicious look. The girl was so smart and said with a smile,</p>
<p>"You probably don't recognize me anymore?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, yes, yes, I can't quite remember"!</p>
<p>As I muttered, she still smiled and said:</p>
<p>"I'm Alan"!</p>
<p>"Oh! It's Alan." I almost jumped in front of this girl. I continued, "Ah! So big now? Ah, where are you studying now? Please come in and sit down and talk!..."</p>
<p>I led her into the faculty office. She told me the school she was studying at. Her attitude was so cautious and humble.</p>
<p>It was many years ago. At that time, Alan was only eight years old. She came to my school to study, and I liked the two dimples on her dark face. She was so naughty in class! But somehow, her naughtiness never made people dislike her, but rather found it interesting!</p>
<p>Because I wore "Rock" glasses, she drew a person wearing glasses and crying! She pulled me and said:</p>
<p>"Sir! This is you, you will also cry"!</p>
<p>I intentionally scolded her a few times, and she immediately pursed her small mouth and ignored me! She ignored me for two days! But on the morning of the third day, her hands were behind her back, and she hopped like a little sparrow, walking in front of me: [space] "Sir: guess what's behind my back?"</p>
<p>She had completely forgotten that I had scolded her! I shook my head. Seeing her so innocent, I held her chubby little black face in both hands:</p>
<p>"I don't know. It's probably something good"!</p>
<p>She smiled and put [her hands] in front of me. Aha! Each hand carried five [something], and the two small black dimples were deep, she said:</p>
<p>"Sir: It's Huzhou [something]! For you to eat!"</p>
<p>Thinking about one or two things is like looking at one or two complex pictures. Now she asked me:</p>
<p>"Sir, how have you been lately?"</p>
<p>I am still very young and cannot stand the kind of words that comfort old people. I said with emotion:</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good"!</p>
<p>I looked at her carefully again, wanting to find those two black, dark dimples on her dark face—but they were gone! She was so cautious in front of me!</p>
<p>We hadn't seen each other for more than four years. After the "January 28th" war, everyone didn't know where everyone lived. She told me that she met some old classmates who asked about my address, whether the school was still running? But they all said they didn't know. This time, she met my mother and knew my address, so she took advantage of this spring break to come and see me.</p>
<p>We talked politely for a while. She left me a mailing address and then said goodbye. I sent her to the door. She bowed deeply to me and said:</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Sir! I'll come and see you again when I have time!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>I couldn't say anything. My throat felt like something was stuck in it. I just nodded with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Her figure disappeared at a corner. I sighed heavily. I closed the door and walked into the house. Accidentally, my right hand touched my chin, and the stubble pricked the back of my hand.</p>
<p>"Ah! I..."</p>
<p>I was again trapped in the loneliness of an ancient temple in the deep mountains!</p>
<h3>Is it Spring?</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fanhai</p>
<p>Is it already spring?</p>
<p>How would I know!</p>
<p>The cool wind brings the bugle calls for marching in the same tone as in the past,</p>
<p>One oily twilight after another brings me blue mornings like in the past,</p>
<p>My feet, stepping through this link,</p>
<p>Must step into that door threshold,</p>
<p>How would I know where spring is?</p>
<p>Is it already spring?</p>
<p>Is this a startling and delightful lie!</p>
<p>The wheels of the whole world are turning around me,</p>
<p>Squealing and splitting my eardrums!</p>
<p>The alarm clock refuses to stop its yo-yo-da-da sound,</p>
<p>My blood and the factory's whistle outside the window,</p>
<p>And the giant wheels spitting white smoke and running wildly,</p>
<p>Are competing with all the ruthlessly spinning belts</p>
<p>Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, it is the same beat!</p>
<p>I jump in these belts,</p>
<p>I jump in these wheels,</p>
<p>If I see spring,</p>
<p>It must be a hallucination, mistaking the red cheeks of the girls under the belts and wheels</p>
<p>For the cherry blossoms of spring!</p>
<p>Is this a startling and delightful lie!</p>
<p>Is it already spring?</p>
<p>Listen to the marching bugle calls,</p>
<p>We are opening our steps!</p>
<p>If spring has really arrived,</p>
<p>Does she not know</p>
<p>I am dragging myself with my left hand, holding the world with my right hand,</p>
<p>To walk over this mountain peak, not allowing rest,</p>
<p>And climb up that difficult pass again;</p>
<p>The angels of happiness and joy have long understood my heart:</p>
<p>I don't want intoxicating wine, only accelerating oil,</p>
<p>If spring has really arrived,</p>
<p>Let her sneak away!</p>
<p>—April 12, 1935—</p>
<h3>Three Days (3)</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>"Really, Amitabha, why can't you understand? The two hundred yuan borrowed from the Dragon Association last year is only due in three days, but it's been raining all the time, the rice can't be harvested, and there's no time to mill the rice. We have to think of a way. The money from the Dragon Association cannot be defaulted. It's only a matter of time, not a matter of days. If we can't borrow next time, what will our days be like in the future?"</p>
<p>"I can't manage that much. We're just tumbling in debt no matter what we do. You can be anxious to death, but it won't get us ahead. Let's talk about it at the end of the month. What if they don't get the money?..."</p>
<p>Youfa was startled when he heard this. He didn't expect his honest and hardworking younger brother to say such strange things. He opened his bloodshot eyes, wanting to say something, but before he could open his mouth, Youcai got up and walked out the door.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but be stunned for a while. It wasn't until the paper cigarette holder burned shorter and shorter and scalded his hand that he suddenly withdrew his hand, put the water pipe on the threshold, and complained that Youcai was going to Hu Yongliang's place again [illegible].</p>
<p>I wonder what ghostly words this kid will bring back next time. Youcai is so foolish and keeps talking to him. Last year, he came back once and taught all the young men, including Youcai, badly. They've all become so stubborn. This is really not a good sign! Youfa said in his mind; young men should endure some hardship. As long as they can endure hardship, one day they won't have any debt and their children will live a good life. How do country people get money? Isn't it exchanged for effort? Wang Genfu in the next village, his father died and left him with a debt. He gritted his teeth and worked hard. During busy times, he worked as a day laborer for others and did his own work early and late. He put aside those odd jobs and got up in the middle of the night to do more work. After suffering for more than ten years, he finally paid off his debt. Is it possible to make a few big words like Hu Yongliang, scold the rich people until their teeth itch, and the debt will disappear? Youfa felt that saying such big words was even worse. They just wanted to be lazy.</p>

<h3>Banning Quack Doctors</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>One of Shanghai's characteristics is the abundance of doctors. On every road and in every alley, you can see signs hanging with "×× Hospital" "×× Doctor." This is probably because of the large number of residents in Shanghai. But among the many doctors in Shanghai, although there are many formal doctors, there are also many doctors without licenses. Most of these unlicensed doctors are from [something] students, pharmacy students, nurses, assistants, etc., or those who have studied medicine for a few years but have not graduated, and some are quack doctors. They have neither adequate medical knowledge nor treat diseases solely for profit. Patients suffer, which is no small matter. We often see a group of quack doctors treating people, each boasting about how skilled they are in medicine and can bring the dead back to life. In fact, they regard human life as grass, prescribing medicine and giving injections at will. It is not known how many patients have died as a result.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Chairman Chiang banned unregistered Chinese medicine practitioners from opening clinics, as it is illegal. They also do not understand scientific disinfection methods, giving patients injections at will for profit, causing harm to patients. Also, guaranteeing the cure of all diseases is also a fraudulent act. In particular, those who perform [something] for people cannot be called doctors at all. Furthermore, they are not allowed to perform surgery and injections indiscriminately, causing danger. Therefore, a strict ban was specially ordered. The Mayor of this city has been ordered to have both the Health and Public Security Bureaus comply with it. It is reported that the Health Bureau has appointed the director of the Bureau of Medicine to coordinate with the director of the Health Care Section of the Public Security Bureau, set a time, and lead the police to inspect the districts, so as to ban them.</p>
<p>This move is of great benefit to the health of the people. It can be seen that as a result of the Shanghai Municipal Government's implementation of inspection and prohibition, local quack doctors can gradually disappear. At least it can reduce their number, which is not a blessing for the general public.</p>
<p>However, to ban quack doctors, it should not be limited to Chinese medicine. All quack doctors who are unregistered must be banned, regardless of whether they are Chinese or Western. Because banning quack doctors must be thorough to be effective. If only a part of it is banned, then other parts will still exist. Patients will still suffer. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Good News</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>Hearing the sounds of "tangerines" and "crispy sugarcane" being hawked in the alley, Lin always hurriedly runs downstairs to buy some, just like a child. She can't even restrain her appetite for a moment, and peels and eats them as she walks back to her room.</p>
<p>"How can you do this! Lin, you haven't eaten breakfast and you're already eating like this. Aren't you going to ruin your stomach?" I'm always worried about her health, so I snatch the sugarcane and tangerines from her hand with sincere concern and a little bit of annoyance. However, she always smiles sheepishly, stretching out her hand to beg for mercy, as if her throat is parched and burning, and also like a "seasoned smoker" addicted to opium; just giving her a little bit is enough to satisfy her.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I go to the street with her, she happens to pass by a fruit stall and sees many light yellow fruits displayed inside, and her mouth waters. She mutters with a wistful air.</p>
<p>"Ren, we haven't eaten mangoes for five or six years. Five or six years, since we left Siam until now. When will we be able to return to Siam and eat them to our heart's content? ... Whenever I see mangoes, I'm reminded of the good days we had in the South..."</p>
<p>"Then let's buy a few to take home, Lin," I said, comforting her wandering heart.</p>
<p>However, as soon as she asks about the price, Lin withdraws her hand.</p>
<p>"Ren, how can they be so expensive? These aren't even top-quality mangoes."</p>
<p>Naturally, someone who has lived for a long time in the South, where mangoes are grown, and is used to eating mangoes, is not very happy to buy inferior mangoes with no fragrance at a high price in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, a relative returned from Nanyang and brought a basket of lovely, light yellow mangoes! This made me extremely happy! I thought to myself: This time, Lin can happily and heartily eat those mangoes from Nanyang that she has missed for so many years!"</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, Lin rejected them without even eating one, frowning and murmuring:</p>
<p>"Why do these mangoes have no taste at all? They're nothing like the ones I used to eat. I really don't want to eat them anymore."</p>
<p>"Lin, this is the 'Ivory Mango' that you've been longing for! ('Ivory Mango' is a fine variety of mango.) It's been five or six</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>years since you've had 'Ivory Mango'! Try it again." I picked out a ripe, soft one from the basket.</p>
<p>But Lin responded by shaking her head.</p>
<p>Lin has definitely been a little abnormal lately, as if she's been exhausted by a gentle spring breeze. She's too lazy to do anything, can't open her eyes all day, and lies in bed, languidly, like someone who's had too much to drink and is dead drunk. Her permed hair has become even more disheveled, and the mirror has become covered with a thin layer of dust because she hasn't gotten up to look at it for many days. Sometimes, even eating makes her feel tired, and she doesn't want to get up.</p>
<p>After she eats, she immediately feels uncomfortable in her stomach and vomits unhappily, her neck bulging with rope-like blue veins, her face flushed red, and panting as she vomits.</p>
<p>"This is the result of you carelessly eating things all the time. Now you've ruined your good stomach!" I helped her to the bed to lie down, feeling frustrated and complaining in my heart that she didn't listen to my advice.</p>
<p>After Lin calmed down, I suggested to her:</p>
<p>"Lin, I'll take you to see a doctor. It's not fun to get sick, especially stomach illnesses, which are even more troublesome... We are both wanderers in a foreign land, so our health is our treasure!"</p>
<p>Stepping out of the hospital's threshold, I could still clearly hear the doctor's two congratulatory words: "Your wife doesn't have a stomach illness, she is pregnant."</p>
<p>Thinking of all the problems that will arise when the little life is born, my head felt dizzy and ached like it was burning, as if several thousand pounds of iron were pressing down on it. Heavens! How can poor wanderers raise a child?</p>
<h3>Arriving Home</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>—Random Notes on Returning South—</p>
<p>After walking along a section of the riverbank and passing through the grassy fields of Xie Village, the dark green foliage of the woods behind my house is finally in sight. Like a lost bird, joyfully jumping, flies back to its old nest. (My hometown is so familiar and lovely!)</p>
<p>It's the rice harvest season, but the withered rice seedlings, sparse ears of rice, and dry, cracked paddy fields make it clear that the villagers' beautiful dream of a good harvest has been shattered by a period of both flood and drought. Many women are scattered in the rice fields, harvesting rice. In the soft light of the setting sun, they have their trousers rolled up to their thighs and are heavily carrying baskets of rice that look like they are suffering from anemia, heading home. In the gentle breeze, I seem to hear a long string of sighs from them.</p>
<p>Leaping from the side alley into the house, it is cold and quiet. The sound of rice threshing rises and falls in the threshing ground. After putting down my luggage, I walk towards the doorway. My mother and aunts, their heads wrapped in scarves, are threshing rice there. My grandmother is squatting on the side, tying up rice straw, and three-year-old Xuan Di is playing with a tin can by my grandmother's side. My sudden appearance surprised my grandmother, whose eyesight is failing, for a moment. Then, trembling, she tightly grasped my hand, and tears of kindness and joy flowed down her face.</p>
<p>—Ah, Aying, you're back! I've missed you for two long years! You're back. She immediately turned around and pulled Xuan Di over.</p>
<p>—Sister, look, your brother is back. Call out 'Brother.' Brother loves sister, good sister.</p>
<p>I picked up Xuan Di in one arm and kissed his tender cheeks. In just two years, this innocent and lovable infant has grown up and can walk and talk. I couldn't help but look up at my grandmother again: her white hair has become deeper, her mouth has shrunken, and the wrinkles on her forehead have become denser. My mother and aunts also have a dark complexion, worn down by hard work, and my lovely mother looks even more haggard. An unspeakable sense of guilt almost makes me want to kneel before my mother. I have been too cruel, too selfish! During my long years of wandering, I barely managed to send a letter home every three months, causing my grandmother and mother to have to set aside some of their worries to think about me, worry about me, and shed tears for me during their days of hard work. Now, still returning in a dilapidated state, I dare not even think about their disappointment and heartache! At this moment, my mother grabbed me, her loving gaze fixed on my face and body. She said:</p>
<p>—Ying, you've lost weight. You must be sick outside.</p>
<p>Saying this, she stopped. This is truly like a sharp and long needle piercing deeply into my chest, my heart, my entire being. Yes, during my two long years of wandering, I have been sick all the time, seriously sick. However, this sickness is not an ordinary cold or flu, a physical illness. The warmth and coldness of human feelings, the meanness of the world, and the instability of life have all forced me to wipe away the childish blush on my cheeks and put on a layer of dusty, troubled, and sickly greasepaint under this immense pressure. Deceit, hypocrisy, viciousness, and ugliness have all gathered into a row of arrows, shooting at me from all directions. How could I not be injured? How could I not be sick?</p>
<p>But can I honestly confide these grievances to my mother? Could I possibly have the heart to inflict another blow on her already wounded heart?</p>
<p>—No, Mom. I've been fine all along. Because of the heat, seasickness, and not being able to eat a grain of rice for three days, so...</p>
<p>I told a lie and quickly turned my back, unable to hold back the tears that streamed down my face.</p>
<h3>A Brief Note from a Sickbed</h3>
<p>— Ming Meng</p>
<p>In the morning, I only felt a bit dizzy, but by the afternoon, I felt very uncomfortable all over. Gradually, my pulse suddenly increased, and my forehead felt hot. My temples also started throbbing with pain. After dusk, even under the blankets, I felt cold, and occasionally my skin would break out in goosebumps. A tickle in my throat indicated that a cough was coming. Adding up these minor symptoms, I clearly felt that this organic structure, which had always been fairly stable, even if not particularly strong, was now experiencing a slight malfunction.</p>
<p>"Good, it's okay to be a little sick," I said to myself, almost as if I were hoping for the illness to come.</p>
<p>There were, in fact, reasons for having this kind of thought. Ever since I had to rely on writing to help with living expenses, my mind had been trampled like it was being ravaged by wild horses. As soon as I put down a thick book, I would receive letters from home complaining about their hardships. After setting aside those letters, I would immediately pick up my pen and start writing. In my spare time, I would flip through various magazines, but before going to sleep, I would have to think about writing topics. My friends all went to the gym and the sports field, but I was constantly being gnawed at by various thoughts and fantasies, leaving me physically and mentally exhausted. I couldn't study properly, and my writing wasn't good either. Should I close my books and stop reading? No! Should I stop writing? Even less so! I had no choice but to grit my teeth and push forward against time with this body that was not very strong.</p>
<p>In the past two or three months, I had gradually felt that this kind of life could not be sustained for long, because my mind and body both seemed to be reacting. My mind was often not very clear, and my spirit seemed to be aging. One day, I tossed down my pen and said:</p>
<p>"Let me be a little sick for two or three days, as a rest!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, these angry words actually came true, and I was quite willing. In the evening, the doctor from my organization came and said it was the flu and that I would be better after a few days of sleep.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness, let me get a good night's sleep! - But this is not a joke, it can only be a few days, too much is not good!"</p>
<p>The doctor smiled and left. (Fortunately, the doctor and medicine from my organization are free, otherwise, I wouldn't be so satisfied.) I took the medicine and fell into a daze, sleeping for a day and a night, forgetting about the whole world and the trivial matters around me. It really felt incredibly blissful! In the following two or three days, as the medicine took effect, the various symptoms gradually improved, so I couldn't sleep completely in a daze anymore. But lying quietly in bed without thinking was also quite enjoyable. When I was bored, I would flip through "La Dame aux Camélias" or "Manon Lescaut," which I found more interesting than reading English books usually. It's just that there was always noise from outside, and I felt that my spirit couldn't settle down to a state of peace and quiet, which was quite regrettable!</p>
<p>Gradually, I could get up and cook porridge to eat. The aroma of the rice was very appetizing; even a poached egg seemed very delicious. It's just that the golden sunlight stung my eyes a bit, and when the wind blew, I felt that my skin couldn't handle it. Even worse, when I thought about having to take on the work of living after I recovered, I could only frown.</p>
<p>The illness can be considered cured, but all the accumulated work is crowding in, making it even more overwhelming. The few days of rest and comfort seem to have made the current burden even heavier, making me frown even deeper and sigh even longer. Even more unfortunate is that my body feels weaker and my spirit more depressed after the illness. As soon as I do anything, my head still feels dizzy, and coughs still occasionally attack me... I can only complain that the doctor and medicine that cost nothing are useless.</p>
<p>"It's still not good to treat illness as rest," is what I think now.</p>

All copies have been given away. Another 20,000 copies have now been reprinted. Those in this city who have not obtained a copy can write to the Yueming Publicity Department to request one. The song was written by Li Faxi, the screenwriter of "Lunacy," and composed by Zhong Zhuru. The lyrics are recorded below for your preview.</p>
<p>Green water and green mountains,</p>
<p>Charming wildflowers smiling,</p>
<p>Happy spring breeze scatters worries,</p>
<p>Annihilates melancholy,</p>
<p>Sweet spring is no ordinary thing!</p>
<p>Sweet spring, birdsong and fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>Dense peach and plum blossoms compete to bloom,</p>
<p>Pity that spring is not long-lasting!</p>
<p>May we, the youth, remember in our hearts,</p>
<p>If you don't work hard when young, you'll be sad when old!</p>
<p>Spring is gone, falling flowers and flowing water bring empty sorrow,</p>
<p>Knowledge is as deep as the sea, think carefully,</p>
<p>Skipping classes and dancing waste your studies;</p>
<p>Misunderstanding modernism is very absurd,</p>
<p>Dancing is said to save the country, skipping classes to resist,</p>
<p>Suicidal ideology is truly lunacy!</p>
