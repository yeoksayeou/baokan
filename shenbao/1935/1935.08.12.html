<p>時評</p>
<h3>英日會議之醖釀</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>據東報所傳英國曾向日政府建議。於今年秋間。舉行英日會議。商討有關遠東之各項問題。日本方面對此建議。準備予以接受。並希望羅斯爵士與英駐華大使賈德幹。均能代表英國出席會議。此項消息雖有待徵實。要亦不爲無因。且羅斯爵士此次來華。照預定日程。擬在日停留多日。而爲避免日本人士之注意起見。將華府之行作罷。是則吾人不得不疑及英國對日已有妥協之傾向矣。</p>
<p>遠東問題。關係素極複雜。其間英國頗有舉足重輕之勢。年來遠東局勢之一張一弛。殆莫不與英國之遠東政第有關。去年八九月間。英巴恩璧調查團赴滿考察之際。英日同盟復活之說。一時甚囂塵。上外國若干報紙曾盛傳英日兩國將成立外交妥恊或締結條約。其主要目標一在於菲列賓以南設立廢除兵備地帶。一在劃分亞洲勢力範圍。英國得在中亞細亞自由行動。而日本則在中國北部自由行動。此種消息。旋以英帝國自治領殖民地與日本經濟利害衝突深刻之故。漸吿平息。海軍預備會議。亦因三角對立關。係宣吿無期休會。日本方面乃採最後手段。官吿廢除華盛頓海約。遠東問題至此似已入於無可妥恊之階段矣。</p>
<p>自日本宣吿廢棄海約以來。英國在遠東之活躍。足使吾人注意。然而在實際上。覓取妥協途徑之意。始終未曾放棄。英保守黨議員對此鼓吹尤力。據彼等王張。英國對遠東問題。應以不開罪日本爲原則。免使時局愈臻惡劣。同時應以極友好之形式。盡調解人之職務。七月十一日。英新外相郝爾在下院發表關於外交之重要演說。對遠東問題仍不忘兩國舊情。謂以敦睦英日友誼。爲其政策之基幹。希望英日兩國友誼繼續發展。而無任何　絆於其間。此種聲朋。固英國外交保守性之充分表現也。</p>
<p>頃者。海軍比率主義。英國旣已自動宣吿取消。日本在東亞之優勢。英國似又已予以尊重。雙方意見如此接近。遠東問題之妥協性自必有相當進展。惟吾人所當注意者。遠東問題非僅英日問之問題。而爲以英日美三角關係爲其主體之問題。英日妥恊。實有引起美國更深反感之可能。美國目前遠東政策。雖以睦鄰爲其表面。然其中心主張。則一在趕速完成其偉大之海軍計劃。一在力謀經濟利益之增進。此則對於英日妥協。實有嚴重之威脅性也。</p>
<p>遠東問題以英日兩國妥協性之增大。或有新的發展。亦未可知但其對於東亞和平。卽有相當效果。亦僅爲局部的。暫時的。面影響所及。則足使其他各國對遠東利益之競爭益趨劇烈。可斷言也。</p>

<h3>南遊印象紀</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記錢華</p>
<p>（一）南遊之動機</p>
<p>年來國內建設、百有進展、粵桂諸省攬南中言物之勝、亦銳意發皇、生產激增、廣西民團訓練之成績、口碑載道、其苦幹精神、殊不可進了非、記者年初一度承中國航空公司當局之邀、有飛遊港粵之計劃、終以天時惡劣、迭次展延、最后又遇霧在溫州折回、西南之遊、遂未實現、今次中國科學社、中國工程師學會、中國化學會中國地理學會、中國動物學會、中國植物學會等六學術團體、應桂省當局之邀、定八月十二日起在南寗舉行聯合年會、研究學術、兼事遊覽桂林山水、名甲天下、復獲當局之大規模招待、殊屬創舉、記者躬逢其盛、得償百聞不如一見之願、　自慶幸、六團體會員報名赴會者不期而獲三百餘人、益以粵桂本地會員、故蒞會人數預算約在四五百人左右、南中苦熱、陽歷八九月尤甚、溽暑遄征內地、復須多携行李、事先揮汗籌備、不以爲苦、乃於七月三十日由滬乘大來公司之柯立芝總統輪赴港、轉粵入桂、預定行期爲一個月、遊程凡五千餘里、走馬看花、所得亦僅、沿途見聞、信筆紀述其印象、六團體馬純粹研究學術機關、集各地學者於一堂、絕對不涉政治範團、則記者所紀、亦謹當本此原則也、</p>
<p>（二）柯立芝總統輪中</p>
<p>會員赴會路綫計分甲、由上海·香港·農州·三水·梧州·貴縣·而達南寗、乙、由上海·香港·梧州·貴縣·南寗、丙、由漢口·武昌·長沙·宜章·樂昌·廣州·三水·梧州·貴縣·南寗、甲乙爲水道、丙爲陸路由水道赴會者、多乘招商局之　元　、可享受船價對折之優待、大菜間定價七十元、僅收三一十五元記者籌備較遲、海元輪之艙位已預定一空、乃改乘三十日開行之大公司柯立芝總統輪、大來及昌興公司各輪售價最昂、二等艙九十七元、頭等百三十元、但海程則較招商縮短二天、滬港間四十二小時可達、在時間極經濟之旅行中、覺縮短海程爲可貴也柯立芝與胡佛兩總統輪爲姊妹號、在大來諸輪中爲最新者、載重二萬五千噸、各項設備最稱完善、侍役均爲粵人、彬彬有禮同輪有赴會會員馮介民、張道宏村等數人、旅途頗小寂寞、頭二等艙中美人居多、而婦女尤佔十之六七、美國婦女最活潑强健、無時不在甲板上盤桓遊戲、靜坐卽讀　寫作、高尙生活最可欽佩、日間多服游泳式之夏衣、曲綫畢露、就晚餐　、咸沐浴盛裝、穿大禮服、雍容華貴、判若兩人、而男子則終　服裝整齊、處處向女子獻殷勤、確　女權高於一切之槪、晚間有跳舞會及電影、乘客咸感興奮、途中因受颶風影響、稍右風浪、美國女子仍姚躍進出、而餐室中我國男女乘客却减少一半、體格强健之分、於此可見、有美籍老年夫婦一對、詢之男年六十有四、加利福尼亞人、購環遊世界票、至遠東尙屬初次、東方情調、最感興　云云、其國民性又如此、輪中例須塡旅客調查表、有永久住址一項、下註倘有失物可按址寄還、當時亦不注意、迨抵港後、匆促遺忘漱洗皂巾諸物、未幾卽由輪役專差至旅館送還、其管理之嚴密設想之週到足資辦理旅行業者之參考也、</p>
<p>（三）乍晴乍雨之香港</p>
<p>八月一日晨八時、輪抵香港、泊九龍、記者二十年前曾一度抵此、於今面月全非、店、室狹小湫溢、而房價奇昂、港地平均凉爽、過熱則雨雨後卽放晴、或未幾又雨、習以爲常、文居民外出、咸爲有雨具、且多爲問製大油紙傘、雖漂亮裝束之中外男女亦然、司空見慣、未足奇也夏令雨衣苦熱、咸屏棄勿御、記者抵港之日、由晨十時起至晚十一時止、乍雨乍晴達五次之多情時忽陰遠望山腰濃霧迷濛、對江莫辨景色、未及卽大雨如注、雨止、旭日高昇濃幕揭開、紡紼海市唇樓、變幻無窮、故港地建築、行人道上多有走廊、與滬市法租界大馬路之建築相同、爲市民便利也、港地黃包車漆作紅色、車夫拷衫綠笠帽、另有一種景象、復有竹轎、山路斜坡非轎莫辦、黃包車起碼爲港幣一角、轎　之西人旅客多喜乘轎、嘗試性質也　夫安步緩行、足以飽覽街市景色、出租汽車多爲一九三五年式、極講究、裝有米突計程器、起碼四角以後卽按行程遞加短途乘坐最爲便宜、居民十之六七能操流利英語、但一般除粵語外、卽普通話亦一字莫解、記者除利用英語外對旅店侍役、唯有作書面問答、啞旅行亦有相當趣味、語言不統一、幣制不統一、誠當前急待解决之問題也、</p>
<p>（四）物價與生活之矛盾</p>
<p>香港之商業及在政治上特殊地位、殆與中部之上海、北部之天津相等、西南政治中心之廣州、猶南東及北平也、故香港政客遺老雲集、富賈僑民雜處、無形中生活程度家漸提高、近來港幣價値日高、滬鈔每百元位港幣七十元左右、同時生活指數亦因之隨漲、記者勾留二日、深覺香港實爲遠東生活最高所在、例如黃包車起碼港幣一角約合滬小洋二角、汽車每小時港幣三元、約合派洋四元二角、中上旅館中級房間房價約四五元港幣、合滬洋六七元、再加以餐費另用等、日非十餘元滬洋不辦、故勞働階級有終日奔波不獲一飽者、但生活昂貴旣如此、而物價反特別低　、誠爲一種極矛盾之現象、　香港爲無稅口岸、各國運港貨物其售價較滬低廉特多、甚至有相　倍許者、宜若各商店可門庭若市矣、但事實上到處减價、而問津極少、人民購買力根本薄弱、除萬分必需者外、咸抱可省則省主義、故苟房金米菜等不能减低、其他普通物價之低落、殊無影響於高昂生活也、香港市中以小兌換舖最多、招牌曰金銀便換、專事兌換各地不同幣洋、其次財爲藥房、印度人所開之雜貨商店、以最便宜貨相號召、絲織品襯衫僅售港幣六角、領帶有賤至一二角者、十之八九爲日本貨、營業鼎盛、其他商舖向經營英美貨者、以價昂失敗、初猶勉力支持、最近亦進日貨、故日貨充斥港埠、</p>
<h3>廣州市大火警　焚商店住戶共二十二家　損失十餘萬元難民百餘</h3>

<h3>華僑聯合會　昨得荷印警訊　華僑與土人械鬥</h3>
<p>新聲社云、本埠華僑聯合會、昨忽接得由荷屬蘇門答臘發出緊急電訊、報吿一極不幸之事件、華僑與當地土人、最近發生集團械鬥、現此種不幸事件、由巴東蔓延而實武牙、而先馬達，震驚荷印全部、新聲社記者昨往訪華僑聯合會常委黃建中氏、據談經過各情誌次、</p>
<p>集團械鬥起因極微</p>
<p>據黃氏談稱、上海華僑聯合會方面、今晨接獲由荷屬東印度之蘇門答臘發來電訊、此種不幸事件、發生於蘇門答臘之東部巴東地方、啟衅事端、原因極細、因巴東地方、舉行華僑與土人足球比賽、雙方均組拉拉隊喝彩捧塲、詎竟以拉拉隊吆喝呼喊雙方發、生爭執竟至動武、最後竟各集團械鬥、</p>
<p>羣情憤激二地繼起</p>
<p>自此事由巴東發生後、消息傳至實武牙地方、華僑與土人雙方均憤懣、亦繼起衝突、於是在實武牙地方之第二次華僑與土人集團械鬥、亦以武力相見、繼實武牙之後、先馬達土人與華僑得訊後、亦發生同樣第三次集團械鬥、據今晨之電訊語氣、截至今日（十一日）止、以上三處之械鬥、固未寧息、而其他各埠、亦在蠢蠢欲動中、</p>
<p>印荷全部在恐怖中</p>
<p>故荷印全部、刻墮於恐怖混亂氛圍中、至雙方之死亡受傷人數、電訊中未有詳盡之紀載、然械鬥之慘烈與夫死亡枕籍、以此情形、於想像中可得、今後當續有電訊、以斷定此不幸事件作何解决、滬上旣有此消息、南京方面、想亦定有電訊、</p>
<p>當局動員彈壓制止</p>
<p>現此事荷印當局、鑒於由巴東、而實武牙·而先馬達·蔓延竟如斯之速、深恐將益擴大、則前途將不可收拾、現已開始用極嚴厲之警權派出全部警務人員彈壓制止、同時荷蘭政府聞訊後、亦急電荷印當局速採取有效辦法、予以制止、同時並請華僑甲必丹（華僑官長名詞）曁我國領事從速以有效方法、出而平息、使事態不致再擴大云云</p>

<h3>小男兒（十二）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>一陣發於童子們中心深處的采聲，對他的酬聲實過於許多銅子的投擲，常他停了下來，顧矚他的四周，彷彿是在說道：</p>
<p>「我已竭盡我的心了，請欣賞這個罷。』</p>
<p>「我說，你彈得眞正好呢，」韜摩說道，他自視彷彿是乃德的大阿哥一般。</p>
<p>拂朗含笑點頭道，「可以到我的音樂隊裏來，做第一位的琴手。」</p>
<p>裴夫人輕輕對她的丈夫說道：</p>
<p>「坦第是不錯的：這孩子確是可以造就的。」裴先生開言之後，頷首至再，一面拍着乃德的肩膊，滿心地說道：</p>
<p>「你彈得好，我的兒。現在來彈些我們所能够唱的。』</p>
<p>於是郤來了這個窮苦孩子一生裏最榮幸最快樂的一瞬，常他被領到了鋼琴邊旁，環列着童子們，也不留意到他破舊的衣服，　以愛敬的熊度注視他，急切等着聽他的重奏。</p>
<p>他們選了個他所知道的一篇歌曲，調整了絃索之後，他們開始奏去，於是提琴笛子和鋼琴領導了童子們聲音的齊唱，響震屋宇。至此脆弱的乃德竟受不住了；到最後一次的呼喊逐漸低落的時候，他臉上的筋肉開始抽動，他放掉了那具提琴，面着壁，哭泣得像一個五六歲的小孩子。</p>
<p>裴夫人正在十分起勁歌唱着，一面在留心阻止小羅勃勿以他的靴子　地拍節，忽然見到乃德哭泣起來，忙開道：『我的寶，這是什麼呢？』</p>
<p>『你們大家待我這麼好，—好得是我所想不到的！我忍不住了，」乃德哭着，一面咳得連氣也喘不過來。</p>
<p>「跟我來罷，寶；你現在須得去睡，好生休息；你已經乏了，這裏是大熱鬧了，」裴夫人裏他輕輕說着；一手挽他的譬領他到她自己的坐落問裏，讓他哭到安靜爲止。</p>

<p>昨日爲我國台　選手許承基表演之第二日、對老將邱飛海、許承基以七比五六比一、連勝二盤、勝來極易之至許第一日旣勝卡爾生、故昨日之勝邱飛海、原爲意料中之事、單打之後、天忽傾盆大雨、半小時後、續作雙打賽、精彩之至、許承基卡爾生直落三勝林寳華朋納費區、中國網球會七八百觀衆、無不心滿意足而歸、</p>
<p>許承基後來居上</p>
<p>老邱昨日之戰許承基、幾將其余身解數、出以就付、邱先開球、一比一後、邱憑其兩對角之深抽及恰七之邊綫球、以三比一勝許、許乃上綱投殺、繼之以發球局、追成三比三、許連發三記重球、再成四比四、然　又以五比四佔先、據戰可想、次局許發球於零—四十落後時、反敗成勝、成各五之平手、經此劇戰、老邱之疲態已見、許遂連下一局、</p>
<p>邱飛海無力應付</p>
<p>人老珠黃、第二盤之老邱、巳如在甕中、無復虎虎有生氣、球旣不能過網、因力竭臂無把握、出界之球累累惶論招架許承基之來球、一局復一局、成四對零、幾有先盤之可能、第五局奪回一局、方免覆沒、結果成六比零、昨日二人之戰、大半爲底綫之左右角抽、故在趣味方面、似不及第一日、許之上網殺球、尤不多見、</p>
<p>雙打戰滿塲精彩</p>
<p>半小時大雨、觀衆在棚下躱雨、幸中國會之球塲為「恩土卡」、故雨後仍能續戰、許卡林朋四人、皆能發重球而綱上有工夫者、故戰來極有雙打之精彩、但許卡兩人能在中塲高殺、發球之較有力、朋納費區、較欠把握、故第二盤四比一六比二、許卡再勝、第三盤又成四比一五比二、林朋連追二局、以六比四直落三分勝負、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （唐子）</p>
<p>缺雨則畏「旱災」，雨多了又怕「水災」。有人說：「天也是難做的。……」其實，這不過是「　天吃飯」的收穫，今日的中國猶係如此，不得不令人浩嘆。國家每年不知開銷多少經費，人民按歲不知耗費若干錢財，其結果則若是。還有什麼可說？</p>
<p>有謂欲達到「婦女解放」的目的，須先「兩性鬭爭」，此實絕大謬誤，蓋「婦女解放」雖以婦女本身為主體，但亦不能排斥男性，在某種條伴上，仍需男子互助一管，與通盤合作。</p>
<h3>鹽厫</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>遠遠的望去，看見一堆烏雲般的瓦蓋，十分整齊，裏邊豎着七八丈高的一根旗杆，天氣晴朗的時候，我們准可以望見那旗杆頂上飄着一扇銀紅色的長旗，近看時，可以看得淸楚上面寫着「奉部督收×鹽」的幾個大字。</p>
<p>那麼這里想介紹幾位奉部督收×鹽的司爺，有一個司爺是打秤的「秤手」，他的面容瘦削，像煞是個老槍，上鹽的時候，他高高地坐在一張高椅子上，把那大了幾兩的進秤，將一包一包的板鹽秤進，他眞是一個能手，他會把進鹽秤得非常巧妙，好比進了三百斤鹽，堆在鹽厫裏，除了折蝕以外，將來秤出去的時候，依然會三百斤，或者還多一點。他很得到厫長的寵愛，可是常被鹽戶罵做</p>
<p>「短命的，不得好死的，絕子絕孫的」</p>
<p>秤鹽的時候，坐在秤手旁邊的，還有一個「花碼司爺」，花碼司爺是記賬的。因爲花碼司爺祇要聽得幾斤幾斤便寫，不要化什麼頭腦，所以薪俸比較的少。餘外的司爺還很多，薪俸也都很大，據說都是些管賬，但是每天除掉看見他們餵鴿子，種花，打牌以外，什麼事兒都不見他們做，就是秤手和花碼除了進　時有一點事情做以外，餘下的時間也都是消費在這些雅事上面的。據熟悉人說；他們做了這件事情，也不大會出來，就是說，這是一個終身職：那麼，他們的生活將是永不會變遷的。如此說來，　厫是他們的求生之地，也是他們活活的墳墓。</p>
<h3>拾甲</h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>夏天，在海濱正是一個甲類繁殖的季節。</p>
<p>居住於海濱的人們，他們有的是常年以捕魚爲業的，有的也是務農的；那時候，漁夫們的春魚汎已告盡，都從洋裏歸來；而農家也已大家種下了禾苗，只要在每天做些車水等的田頭工作。—爲了要求補助生活上費用的不足，各人就不得不趁着餘暇的當兒，再以勞疲的軀體，在海灘上作着拾甲類的工作。</p>
<p>當每次上下半天潮水退到海裏去之間，就有許多跣着醬腿，披着破布衣的人們，從鵠候着的堤塘的上面，一個個的跨下到海灘上去。一片曠大的海灘，剎時間望去便有着無數的人們，傴僂地一上一下的跋涉着海泥，零落的在各個泥潭的所在，拾若或捉着甲類。其中有很多的是孩子，也有幾個將近成年的健美姑娘；他們一面拾著甲類，一面有時駛着泥船，擲着泥塊大學相戲着：更有時爭吵起來，哭起來了。火一般的太陽光，晒在他們每一個人的頭上，背上，汗在每個人的身上狂流；但是他們爲了生活，决不避這個赤帝的施虐，所以非到潮水復漲，或携帶的筐子提桶盛滿的時候，不會回上岸來。</p>
<p>甲類中計分爲蟶子，蛤蜊，梅蛤，海螺，海蟹……等等，但海蟹每需　潮水漲的時候，把身子浸在漫深的海水裏，用網捕捉的。他們每天將拾着或捉得的甲類，到街市裏去買給收買海產的行家：大槪一天中可換得三五角錢，而孩子的所得最多不過二角左右。可謂苦極了！</p>
<h3>大家庭</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>尊親，有扶育敎養之恩的，兄弟，如手足，痛癢相關的，夫妻，是患雖與共，甘苦同嘗的伴侶，師友，是切磋琢磨，立身社會上相互提携，大家帮忙而最不可或缺的。可是，在現社會，尤其是在我們貴國正在新舊禮敎沒有分淸楚的現社會，比較上人口最多，文物最盛的江浙一帶，咳，說也奇怪，我前面所說過的尊親，兄弟，夫妻，師友，都會爲了一個字而把一切情感，恩愛動搖，何以呢？這世界是金錢的世界，大家會得爲了一個「財」字而發生許許多多的新奇事兒，會得父不父，子不子，夫妻不是夫妻，朋友不是朋友，這力量，會得推翻一切，扛倒一切，這其間究竟還是「財」字的權威吶？還是潮流應該如此呢？還是政治不上軌道，才會如此的呢？作者實在講解不出來。</p>
<p>戲劇，是描繪人生，咒咀人生，領導人生的。電影是戲劇的一種，現在明星影片公司最近攝製的一本「大家庭」影片中，對於前面的那個「財」字，有很詳細，很透澈，很滑稽，很動人的描摹，導演是張石川先生，張先生他就是會得洞燭現社會的最裏層，這部「大家庭」，表演得如何？我可以不必先來鼓吹，好在就要在本外埠的各大電影院公映，大家自會得去批評的。不過，關於那本劇本的內容，我認爲是現社會對症發藥的一部很有力量的值得稱許的巨片，片爲全部有聲，更能助長劇中的精采，讀者且等着瞧吧！</p>

<h3>機器人</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>歐美的科學，突飛猛進，一日千里，重要的新發明品，一天一天的在增加起來，那些發明家的頭腦和手指，眞的是巧奪天工，那得不使，嘆服呢！他們能做鋼質的手指，替人紡織極細的絲，其精美光滑，遠過於人類的手指，如今他們史能做科學的眼睛，耳朶，鼻子，神經，肌肉，其效用之偉大，都在人類之上。那些眼睛是用電的，耳朶和鼻子是用吸鐵石的，神經和肌肉全是用金屬物製成的，它們儘可以日夜的工作，不覺得疲乏，旣無浪休息，也不必放假，即使擱起不用，也不會引起嚴重的失業問題。</p>
<p>有一隻機器眼能揀選橋子，它能從許多尙未成熟的靑色的橘子中，揀出已成熟的金黃色的橘子來，比了任何人類的內眼來得迅速而正確。又有一隻機器眼，它日夜看守着工廠中汔鍋下面的大火爐，看了火燄的顏色，就知道火力的過與不及，隨時加以糾止，它也比得上一個很老練的火夫。</p>
<p>有一家公司中備有一個專管打字的機器女人，它借着電力工作，一刻不停，不像普通的打字女郎，時時要拿出小鏡來，塗脂抹粉的。有一家電報局中有一個利用電力的機器人，管理着一百多個女工。又有一個守夜的機器人，從不垂民，也從不霎一霎她得眼靑，尚有甚麼偷兒向窗內張望一下，它立刻會打鐘報警。</p>
<p>有一位大學敎授發明一個機器人，能吸雪茄，紙烟和烟斗，它的喉管和肺管都是玻璃製的，每一分鐘中能吸進好多口的烟，而可以在它胸口的玻管中現出它所吸的烟色。有一家工廠裝着一面很大的電招牌，每夜用電不少，非到天色極黑的時候，是不肯旋明的。於是他們在廠　頂上裝了一個電眼，望着天空，管理那招牌上的電流，不論旋明旋滅，從無錯誤，每逢發生風潮的日子，天色突然暗了，它立刻會把那電招牌旋明起來。</p>
<p>德國首都柏林城中，有一家首飾店出售極名書的朱贊寶日，爲了方　盜賊起見，也用一個幾器人，擔任守望之責，白天尚有人在窗前　望或爬上窗門，那人影着在它的電眼上，就有警報發出。到了晚上，倘有盜賊將電筒向窗中照射它一見之下，就將警鐘亂鳴起來。要是那盜盜賊不用電筒闖入店中，那麼另有一個機器人會對付他，祇要他的身影着在那機器人的一雙無形的紫外線眼光上，也就立時報警，異常神速。這種機器人還可以放手槍或擲瓦斯　，但是店主深怕發生意外的危險，所以沒有裝上這種機關。</p>
<p>在最近一個大宴會中，有一位美麗的模特兒登臺表演伊的曲線美，演畢之後，有人介紹伊和一個機器人相見。道機器人裝扮得像一位紳士一樣，大家都稱它爲戴立魯先生。那模特兒向機器人鞠了一躬，走上前去，機器人立時站起身來，表示很謙和的樣子。模特兒開口說道：「您可好？」機器人也道：『您可好？』模特兒道：「請坐請坐。」機器人答道：「是，先生。』當下它就坐了下來。瞧道機器人對待女客的態度，確有君子之風，不過對女客稱先生，未免錯誤，然而無論男女老少，它是一視同仁的。它不會向女人賣弄風情，因此它也沒有愛人，沒有爭風吃醋，一切麻煩的事情。</p>
<p>這機器人十分能幹，它會開電風扇，熄滅燈火，管理一具眞空的去塵器，和其他種種煩瑣的工作。它也識數目，倘把它放在影戲院門口，能點算看客共有多少，使賣票員無從作弊。它在工廠中，又能整天的立在送貨機旁，一包包的貨物，經過它的眼前，一一點算淸楚，其有大小參差或標貼不整齊的，還得給它挑剔出來，退回原處。</p>
<p>機器人的效能，已足打倒人工，將來世界失業的人，恐將有增無减。至於最近美國人發明以機器人駕駛飛機，一樣的會橫行空中，擲彈殺敵，那是更足驚人咧。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>于是我才知道太后是要我們來瞧一種自然界的奇景的，這個是誰都不會不感興趣的我的視綫便牢牢地看着那些荷花的蓓蕾，當然它們的數目很多的，到處可以看到，像一頭未出巢的小鳥一樣伏在綠葉的中問；前幾天，我也見過不少的蓓蕾了，昨天我還見過，我差不多是看它們由小而大的長起來的，現在已是很肥大了，且又充滿着一股奮發的生氣。</p>
<p>灰色的天幕已漸漸地揭盡了，曉風和微波也不再無意識的活動了；彷彿是連它們兩位也在靜悄悄地等待着那奇景的顯露。晨光慢慢的透發，照遍了各處，便是我們身上的衣服，也漸見光亮了。</p>
<p>我不覺又想起了前幾天的那次早朝，以及昨晨才頒布的那條上諭，忍不住偷眼過去看了太后幾眼，從伊此刻的容色上推想，很顯然地可以知道伊早就把那被放逐的廣東巡撫忘懷了；這伴事的影響已經完全消失，伊此刻是正在全神貫注地盼望着那快要升上來的太陽，和那些含苞欲放的蓓蕾。</p>
<p>終于，我們可以看見那紅得像血，圓得像盤的太陽的項兒了，大家不由格外鄭重地注視着，連太后自己也只敢用一種耳語似的聲音，悄悄地說道：「你們快瞧着啊！」（三八七）</p>

<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>浣花道，程先生肯說這話，就難得。誰就是跟着程先生作姨太太，也是福氣。他說到這句話的時候，居然在淚痕滿而的當中，帶出一些笑容來。自然？隨着笑容，選有些紅暈。志前本就覺得這女人的而容，有些憔悴。而且又在哭中帶笑，那簡直覺得是一分凄慘。自然是隨着一呆，也就無話可說。浣花又默然了一會子道：我並不是因爲有事要求程先生，才向程先生說好話，我實在覺得程先生這個人是位忠厚長者，不能不佩服。因爲如此，所以我想求程先生，我也只好直說出來，對與不對，都請你原諒。志前對他臉上注視了一番，便笑道：果然，你要覺得我有什麼力量可以帮助你的話，你就實說，不必這樣客氣。浣花又在那滿佈淚痕的臉上，苦笑着，因道：也並沒有什麼要緊的事，不過……我想你先生也知道，我眞是說不出口來，因爲我們的交情太淺了。志前道：你的意思，我明白了，是不是爲了川資問題。浣花道：程先生自然是聰明得很的人，我還說什麼？說句不害羞的話罷，只有求程先生恩典恩典了。志前沉吟看一會道：大家都在作客中，你總也知道，這銀錢不是怎條容易的。浣花那略泛　量的臉，便有點蒼白。（二八七）</p>

<h3>醫療大衆化與公醫制（上）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>年來我們醫界有一個合乎時宜的口號，叫做「醫療大衆化」。這一句醫療大衆化的意義，就是說！醫療不應是少數人所專有，應該是屬普遍的大衆，爲全體大衆所公有，因爲有資產的人們生了病，固然需要醫治，需要療養，毫無資產的貧民害了病，也是需要醫治，需要吃藥。</p>
<p>於是在民間有了醫療大衆化的需要和呼聲，在醫界也有醫療大衆化的提倡與推動。</p>
<p>這一個「醫療大衆化」的口號，漸漸地紙頭上的提倡宣傳，進而至於實際施行。像上海有一部份的醫師，在他們的私人診所中，規出一個時間，作爲免費診病的工作。上海市醫師公會爲推行免費診病的普遍，有會員免費診察券的辦法。這種種的辦法，究其目的，也無非想使醫療大衆化，普遍化，叫無力診病的大衆，付不起診費的朋友，享受到醫療的福利咧。</p>
<p>然而這「醫療大衆化」施行後的成續怎樣？施行是實際的施行了，成績呢，只好說比未去施行好了一些吧，而與眞正的「醫療大衆化」，簡直差遠！醫師公會登了廣吿贈送免費施診劵，大衆們去領取該劵的，並未見得「門庭若市」。其他一部份私人施診的醫師，有的在施診的時間，就診的病人，不見得比例診時間　的病人增多多少。所以這少數私人的免費施診，不能得到滿好的成續；只能說是比不去施行施診多少好了一點兒，却談不上眞正的所謂「醫療大衆　　！</p>
<p>這是什麼原故？社會上，需要免費的施診嗎？不是，决計不是！社會是十二萬分的需要着免費施診的，體弱多病的勞苦大衆們，更是急需着解除病痛的醫藥！然而免費施診之所以不能普遍，是有幾種事實上的原因在。</p>
<p>第一個原因，是病人的智識問題，這句話不是說，去到醫師那兒診治毛病，必須具有如何的識，但至少亦　對於這免費施診的本身，先要認識。然要認識免費施診這事，却無形中只限於具有最低限度的粗淺智　的大衆了。就如無力診病的大衆當中說，有失業的智識分子，有小商人小職員，有拉車過日的　夫，有拖地板倒碼桶生活的娘姨，更有終日在場中做工的工人，然在這各種項業中的大衆們，越是未受敎育的勞苦大衆，越是不容易認識免費贈送施診這種事。醫如醫師公會的免費施診劵的贈送廣吿，是登載在報紙上的，這許多最下層的大衆，便無機會看報，無能　看報，又如何告他們認識，如何叫他們曉得呢？就是其他能看報紙的大衆們，他們亦不一定加以注意，或者便是看到了，仍抱壞疑態度，把牠與一般江湖醫生的滑頭廣吿同樣看待，當牠作招呼生　的吸引廣吿，亦說不定呢。</p>
<p>第二個原因，是一般人，尤其是有一些智識的人們，對於免費施診這種事的觀念問題，他們知道免費施診，的確不要出診費，但對于醫師的免費送診，總以爲是馬馬虎虎。其實，亦並不全然！醫師當中，勢利的固多，慈仁初亦不能說絕對沒有。不過話又回頭，在現社會底下，做醫師的，爲生活計，不能把全部的時間，都放在免費的施診工作上。換言之。他們的大部的時間必須放在一般例診病人身上，才能取得報酬，才得過活。不然，醫師自己不能生活，俟餓服務，也萬無是理。做醫師的，能在他的例診時間中，按出若干時間，來作免費施診，已經是盡了心力的了！要他用全力來做施診工作，這是絕對辦不到的事。這不是醫師之故，是現社會制度使然。所以社會上一般人對于施診，尤其是私人診所中的免費施診這種事的觀念，總與普通例診有醫別，總以爲無普通例診時的那麼精細，總以爲是馬馬虎虎，一部份因由于病人的過慮，然客觀的　實，　醫師不能用全力去作施診工作，現社會制度，不容許一郎份肯議牲願做大衆化工作的醫師，去作眞正醫療大衆化的工作任務，也是事實。這也是免費送診不能有好成續的一個原因。</p>
<p>第三個原因，仍然是病人的經濟問題。這句話，初看來，似乎講不通：旣然免費送診，爲什麽經濟上還成問題呢？實則，仔細一想，又是事實。免費送診，只是醫師看病免收診費；看了病後，吃藥，打針，便仍需手錢。醫師盡了義務，送了診，已能够了，再要他們拿出錢來奉送針藥，總說不過去，事實上亦萬難辦到。病人拿到藥方，不能不到華房去配藥。一張方子，普通頂便宜說，也得半元一元的樣子。對于眞正貧苦的大衆，這一元半元錢的數目，也便無力設法了，如果需要打針，需費更多，貧病的大衆們，更不易設法了。所以免費施診，表面上似乎很好聽，是在替無力醫療的大衆放個便，解决他們的診病問題，事實上，仍需要有最低限度的經濟能力的大衆，（或者只能說是小衆了）才能享受得到。至　眞正大衆化普遍化，還不能跳過這一個經濟的關口，達到「醫療大衆化」的理想目的。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（六十三）腹水（Ascites）</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做腹水</p>
<p>（答）這是身體內的水分　　在腹腔內的病狀，俗名鼓脹的就是。</p>
<p>（問）人們怎樣會起腹水？</p>
<p>（答）腹水的發生原因，不外乎三種：（一）是鬱血，像心臟病肺病的時候，全身血液循環起障礙或肝臟病時門脈起鬱血時。</p>
<p>（二）腎臟炎時。（三）貧血和惡液質等。</p>
<p>（問）腹腔內所　　的水分，性狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這種腹水，是黃色透明的液體，含有百分之一到三分的蛋白質，比重一〇一二。有時呈血性，有時是乳糜性，有時是脂肪性。</p>
<p>（問）息了腹水的病人，他的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）腹水的　積量，若不一公升半以上，他覺的不能證明。因爲最　　留在骨盆腔內，所以務　將病人的薦骨部抬高成令取膝肘位俯伏時纔得檢查。等到積　多量的時候，腹部膨滿，而在仰臥位的　候，前面成扁平，向側方擴張，好像蛙的腹部那樣。直立的時候，下腹部非常膨滿，臍窩消失或突出呈臍脫腸症的樣子（見　圖）。腹部緊張，放光澤，皮膚有時膨得成裂紋，將來病愈後留着許多花紋，像經產的婦人那樣。</p>
<p>（問）　　腹部的時候，聲音起什麽變狀？</p>
<p>（答）腹水部呈濁音，有波動，並且跟着體位而變動。</p>
<p>（問）腹部皮膚表面，現出什麽？</p>
<p>（答）在高度的腹水，皮下靜脈擴張，像蛇行狀。</p>
<p>（問）心搏和呼吸，起有什麽變化？</p>
<p>（問）因爲腹腔內積水之後，膈膜被抬高，因而心悸亢進，呼吸促迫困難，</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷腹水呢？</p>
<p>（答）只要由腹部膨滿，波動，打診音的跟體位變換而變化等並且查他過去的原因，就得診定。</p>
<p>（問）腹水症，應該和那　種病相區別？</p>
<p>（答）應當和腹膜炎，卵巢囊腫，腎臟水腫，姙娠子宮，和膀胱充盈等相區別。</p>
<p>（問）患了這種病的預後，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>（答）大多數是不良。</p>
<p>（問）腹水的治療，怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）第一須行原因療法，先查出發生這病的原病而加以治療。第二，行對症療法，就是給與利尿　瀉下劑使水分排出，或用强心劑發汗劑等也行。食物忌水分多食乾燥的食品。腹水量十分多量時，可行穿刺術以放泄積水。（完）</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（二七）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>星紅熱喉痛星紅熱初起患者也要覺到喉痛，喉痛的原因是由於扃桃腺與喉部發炎。這一種喉痛是星紅熱病狀之一。治療宜以星紅熱爲目標，不宜單注意喉痛而忽略星紅熱。</p>
<p>文森氏咽峽炎喉痛與白喉相似，這種發炎常發生於喉部與口腔內。發炎的原因是由於文森氏梭形桿菌與螺旋菌。治療除用和平性殺菌液嗽喉外在患處撒新薩乏散粉效最大。</p>
<p>梅毒喉痛梅毒於初期之末與第二期之中患者常覺喉痛。這是一種較輕的喉痛與慢性扁桃腺炎或慢性喉炎相似。這種喉痛不是任何內服藥或嗽喉藥所可收效。治療此種喉痛不必憂慮喉痛，而宜注意注射梅毒專藥。</p>
<p>耳痛</p>
<p>耳痛有幾種，因地位不同，故輕重也有不同。要辨別各種耳痛須知耳之構造。茲略述耳部之構造以作研究耳痛的基礎。</p>
<p>耳分三部：（一）外耳。我們所注重的是由外耳道口至耳膜爲止。此膜亦稱爲耳鼓膜是外耳道與中耳　的隔膜。（二）中耳。位於耳膜以內與內耳之外，係骨中一孔穴內有數小孔與內耳向通。中耳與鼻喉腔間有一隧道似的耳氣管構通中耳與鼻腔，故鼻內之毛病能影響中耳，病菌有時也能經此管侵入中耳。由中耳向上向後通耳隱窩，再由耳隱窩向後通乳突骨骨小房。此骨小房或稱竇位於耳後隆起的乳突骨內。小房係合多數小骨穴而成。乳突小房向外骨堅厚向內與大腦</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>相隔爲僅厚如紙的骨。故乳突骨房內發炎時極易腐壞此薄骨，致膿與病菌得侵入大腦。病菌一侵入腦筋就成了必死的毛病。（三）內耳。爲司聽司身體平衡的神經感覺所在與大腦相隔一層骨。</p>
<p>外耳道炎外耳道最平常發生的毛病爲耳癤小膿瘡。腫服時常是非常疼痛。其原因爲外耳道爲一小骨隧道外包一層皮，腫脹時沒有仲張的餘地。故痛之性質爲張痛。生耳癤的原因多是由指甲抓破或剃頭匠剜破。治療照以下二原則：第一在未成膿前於外耳道內滴入甘油化的石炭酸。石炭酸可麻木發炎部份的神經感覺器故能减去疼痛。第二癤一成膿卽當割一小口將膿放出，放膿後旣去張力故疼痛可以消除。</p>
<p>中耳炎中耳炎最大的原因係病菌由鼻腔中經耳氣管侵入中耳。中耳炎起始常是急性，且患者兒童居多。有時兒童啼哭噪鬧，身少發熱，若無顯著別種病狀不可不留意及中耳炎。中耳炎的危由郛突骨房達到大腦而成沉疔，故治中耳炎時亦宜注意及其嚴重性與避免生腦部膿腫。可以减少發炎期問疼痛的是用冷熱敷法一日數次。避免腦部受直接侵染的方法第一要緊的是中耳內一生有膿就割破耳膜，使膿向外而不致向內。</p>
<p>乳突骨房炎有時繼中耳發炎患者覺到耳後深處痛。乳突骨上筋肉也腫起。手按乳突骨覺骨內疼痛難忍。身體或者也少許發熱。愛克司光照可見乳突骨房內有膿影。一證明了是乳突骨房炎卽當割治，使骨房內膿由割開口向外流免向內流而成大禍。</p>
<p>眼痛</p>
<p>眼科嚴重的毛病是應當由眞正眼科醫師醫治的。但是患者若能有些常識與自己也有益處不小。此處所述是幾種要緊眼痛，略指出各種病狀與治療的南針。假設患者糢糢糊糊，再找一糢糢糊糊醫生醫治，那末，不但眼痛治不好就是斷送目光也不是難事。</p>
<p>淋病紅眼此種紅眼性質很嚴重，患者全眼腫脹，發紅疼痛。所流出膿中可查出淋病雙球菌。患者受傳染的原因是將自已淋病菌隨手帶入眼中，或將別人淋病菌藉不潔毛巾擦入眼中。此種紅眼不宜當爲普通紅眼治。假設當爲普通紅眼治患者很容易成爲瞎子。治這種眼病不是單解决眼痛的問題，故患者宜請靠得住的眼科醫師診洽，在他指揮之下可免去失明。</p>
<p>眼虹膜炎虹膜亦稱眼簾爲一圓圈形膜圍繞瞳仁，能收縮能伸張。其收縮則瞳孔放大，其伸張則瞳孔縮小。虹膜發炎時發紅部分是圍繞黑眼球，紅綫成放射狀？患者覺到眼痛，痛的部分是眼球，同時也反射痛到額部與顳　部。痛常是夜間較白畫厲害。虹膜炎最平常的原因是梅毒。由此可見梅毒在身內是無惡不作。再其次的原因是風濕痛。還有些原因非專門研究不易知道。</p>
<p>治療這種眼痛知查出係屬梅毒，除局部治眼外宜採普通治梅毒法。如果不根治梅毒這種眼病是不會好的。如果風濕病是病源須根本治療風濕病。如係別種原因也當按病理治療。至於局部治療法中以用阿妥品放大瞳孔使虹膜休息爲最要。詳細治法須請眼科專家指導。</p>
<p>全眼球炎全眼球有時發炎完全化膿，眼球非常疼痛，同時也發生頭痛，身體發冷發熱。患者多數失明有時也引起腦膜炎。患者務卽早請專家診治。</p>
<p>靑光眼是一種毛病眼內壓力特別增大。病分幾期，最終達到雙眼失明。靑光眼發作時患者覺到眼睛非常疼痛與頭痛。目光日漸糢糊，眼的視界也日漸縮小，瞳孔有蒸氣狀微發靑色故名靑光眼。這是一種非常危險的毛病，患者萬勿遷延時日。治療原則爲减去眼球內壓力。此種目的可由外科方法或用藥方法達到，由專家指導挽回失明，尚不過難</p>
<p>急性淋巴腺炎</p>
<p>全身各處都滿布細微的淋巴管，多數細微管匯合而成較大管。有些管的中間有淋巴腺。腺的功用與濾器相似。淋巴管吸收身內的組織液轉輸入血。液經淋巴腺時如內中有病菌往往被淋巴腺扣留。故淋巴腺爲身體外部的第一防綫。假設沒有這些淋巴腺病菌一由破皮處侵入就可隨淋巴液長驅直入心內，而由血流可達到身體任何部分。淋巴腺之性質也與各處公安分局相似。有時病菌之毒非常大，一經侵入淋巴腺就起嚴重反應，卽急性淋巴腺炎。</p>
<p>現在以頸項部之淋巴腺爲例。比如，面部發炎頸項之淋巴腺就腫脹疼痛。面部生瘡也有同樣之結果。口內爛牙或牙牀爛也常叫下牙牀骨下之淋巴腺起急性發炎。急性發炎起頭發紅發腫疼痛難忍，經一兩星期發炎腺或化膿或自行消腫不等。</p>
<p>身體別處的淋巴腺作用也是一樣，例如手指腫爛腋下之淋巴腺也常發炎成膿腫。脚部腿部腫爛大股土部內面之淋巴腺也腫脹生膿。生殖器生軟性下疳或淋病，腹股相接處之淋巴腺常腫脹潰爛而成滑瘍，—不潰爛的爲橫痃，其潰爛的俗稱魚口（注意梅毒之橫痃常是較平和性）。</p>
<p>此處也可順便談談淋巴管炎。淋巴管炎多是急性，其發炎原因爲皮肉部發炎病菌順淋巴管侵入。淋巴管發炎的病狀是患處起紅綫，最常見之處是手臂與腿部，同時身體也發冷發熱。淋巴管炎也常是淋巴腺炎之導火綫。</p>
<p>治療淋巴腺炎用冷熱敷，於止痛消腫有相當益處。發炎的淋巴腺一成了膿就當割開放膿出去。如果大腿上部內面發生淋巴腺炎止痛消腫最妙的方法是靜臥休息數日。如此行大槪可以消患於無形。至橫痃與魚口除普通治療外宜採專門治法。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（五十九）　喉頭梅毒</p>
<p>梅毒一症。人人都知。臨床上可以分爲初期，第二期，及第三期。到了第二期及第三期。就要侵犯內臟。現在所講的喉頭梅毒。就是在第二期及第三期所發生的。若在初期的時候。普通是很少。</p>
<p>喉頭在第二期梅毒所發生的種種病狀。有梅毒性喉頭炎，白斑，扁平胼胝腫，及續發的潰瘍等等。現在分述如左　。</p>
<p>（一）梅毒性喉頭炎梅毒感染後。經過六星期至十二星期。或更經過若干日以後。始發此種喉頭炎。此種喉頭炎和單純性喉頭炎很難區別。所以患者往往祇知是喉頭炎。而不知是由梅毒而來的。在會厭軟骨部，常有薔薇疹樣的斑點。粘膜大槪潮紅。但不是單純發赤。乃是略帶暗紅或紫赤色。往往發生表面剝脫。頭部淋巴腺現出特異的腫脹。聲音多帶嘶嗄。</p>
<p>（二）白斑白斑本爲梅毒第二期特有的徵象。所以喉頭梅毒在發赤的粘膜面上。往往現出白斑。此種白斑喜發於聲帶，會厭軟骨部，披裂會厭皺襞及後壁等處。牠的形態。頗不一樣。有圓形的。有不正形的。</p>
<p>（三）扁平胼胝腫扁平胼胝腫在梅毒第二期中。亦爲特有的症狀。但在喉頭梅毒大約比較的稀少。若是發生扁平胼胝腫的時候。那就現出表面不平的灰白色或淡紅色的扁平隆起。有時候發生淺表性潰瘍。潰瘍底常有污穢黃色膿樣物遮被。並有乳嘴樣的赤色小點突出。</p>
<p>喉頭梅毒在第三期梅毒的時候。也是發生護謨腫。通常梅毒感染後。經過五年至十年。方始發生。起初多爲限局性半球狀的隆起。大小不定。小者如粟粒。大者如榛實。表面平滑。現暗紅色。頗堅硬。周圍的粘膜。現出炎性腫脹。這種隆起或爲孤立。或爲多發。在喉頭內，無論何處。都可發生。尤其是會厭軟骨最多。這種護謨腫，經過短時間。就可破壞而成潰瘍。潰瘍多爲深襲性。潰瘍邊緣。多爲銳利。周圍現暗紅色而腫起。潰瘍的底。附着污穢豚脂樣物。</p>
<p>講到喉頭梅毒的症狀。在有炎症狀的時期。常發聲音嘶嗄。在侖厭軟骨部，發生扁平胼胝腫的時候。則有輕度的嚥下隊磚。若是一旦發生護謨腫。則來嗄聲，失聲，嚥下困難等症。在破壞而成潰瘍的時期。則咳出不潔的膿性分泌物。或混血膿汁。且放呼氣惡臭。</p>
<p>喉頭梅毒的療法。是和一般梅毒療法相同。厲行驅梅療法。同時須就專科醫師施用局部療法。方爲上策。</p>
<h3>現代花柳病學通俗演講（十三）</h3>
<p>— 陳生白（編述）殷木强（校正）</p>
<p>第二編　淋病</p>
<p>第六章關於治療淋病問題</p>
<p>由以上之列論。可知淋病之治瘉。以在初期爲最便利最確當。故在患淋病者。應有此種觀念。如已知有感染淋病之可疑時。（如旣往症之遊冶於花柳界，既在症之尿道分泌物及輕度炎症。）有立卽求治於專科醫師之必要。</p>
<p>如由旣有之症狀。依膿分泌中顯微鏡的檢靑。已經醫師之診斷。確定爲淋病時。則應絕對遵守醫師之囑付。以期迅速之治瘉。下文所述。爲一般的淋病患者所應守的法則。曁提出治療時一二注意之事項。向續者伸述之。一、攝生法</p>
<p>甲、害因之除去骨內盤。特別是陰部之充血。必須極力避免之。蓋以促進病機之發展也。故患淋病者。應限制運動。例如乘馬，乘車，體操，行軍，旅行，長距離之散步。咸須禁避。此外如正規之便通。亦足以防止炎症之進展。</p>
<p>過度之運動。不特惹起陰部之充血。且以運動之後。往往以出汗太多。而减少小便之數量。如此。不能使濃厚之膿汁。藉小便而稀薄。浮游之細菌。更不能依物輝的作用而洗滌於外方。致排尿時疼痛難堪。而淋菌之增殖更盛矣。</p>
<p>乙·與飲食物之關係酒類及刺戟性之飲食物。不僅直接刺戟尿道。且以興奮之結果。致妨害睡眠。引發勃起。間接的使本病之經過不良。故當絕對禁止之。至於多是無刺戟性飲料之攝取。確能增加尿量。呈洗滌尿道中分泌物之作用。而與以良好之影響。</p>
<p>丙·性交與勃起之避免患淋病者之性交。旣增進其病勢。又有傳染他人之危險。故宜絕對禁止。他如荒淫之小說，談話，照相，電影等。亦有免除之必要。至於勃起。當患病期問。（尤其在急性期。）以炎症之結果。而來不自然之勃起者。往往有之。此時患者每以疼痛而妨害睡眠。更來陰部之充血腫脹。致增進其炎症。及助成淋菌之內侵。故對於此病理的勃起須有處置之必要。局所冷　包之佈施。鎮靜劑之投與。衣被之須輕薄等。皆爲其有效之方法。</p>
<p>丁·使用提睪帶之注意用提睪帶以安靜陰莖及保護後尿道與睪丸。固爲良好之方法。但應注意使陰莖弛緩。不受壓迫。二·內服藥</p>
<p>內服藥直接殺菌作用有限。僅减其分泌。消其炎症。緩其痛苦。除其急性之現象。故作爲急性或亞急性期之待期療法及補助療法可也。茲將使用內服藥時之當注意者。略舉一二如次。</p>
<p>甲·檀香油是已成歷史上有名之治淋劑。此際。當注意（一）有胃病者。每致發生噯氣。减少食慾。甚至發急性胃炎。（二）有腎病者。每被刺戟而起蛋白尿。故不可濫用。觀市上所售之白濁丸。幾皆以本品爲主成分。服此者。其須謹愼出之。</p>
<p>乙·尿道消毒劑此中如Wrotropin，Salol。俱爲常用之品。惟於最急性時亦有刺戟粘膜之弊。故對於過敏性之粘膜及已有著明之炎症症狀者。當避之。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（六三）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第七節　其他的合併症</p>
<p>（一）腹部器官之澱粉變性。在腹部器官中，若脾，肝，腎，腸，等部分，都可以發生澱粉變性的；他的發生，差不多有五分之四係由於結核症的；單獨拿肺結核症來說，已佔有三分之二的數目，這裏面尤以慢性空洞性的型式為多。關於他的臨床上症像，大抵不甚顯著，肝臟和脾臟兩部分尤少，　我們可以說一句，就是：除開器官腫大和觸之平滑硬固外，是毫無其他症象可言的。腎臟澱粉變性則尿中發現蛋白，這蛋白量有時是很多的。腸部澱精變性則發生下痢，甚至不可制止，所渭崩塌性下痢是。患者往往因之而死。腹部澎漲，和腸結核症有時狠似的。——澱粉變性預後極不良；病壯的轉愈是不可能的，就是能延長至二數年之久的例子也是狠少的。治療則行對症療法。</p>
<p>（二）神經炎。急性和亞急性神經炎症，在肺核症方面也是時見發生的。時為單獨性，但多數性的神經炎也可同時發生的。他的原因，大慨是中毒的關係，因為神經中時常可發見結核　桿菌的。此種神經炎經過情形殊為頑固，但預後則大半系屬諸優良的。</p>
<p>（三）結核性僂麻質斯症。這是一個沒有完全肯定的名詞；他的內容之說明和原名之提出，系由於Pcncet氏。他是帶僂麻質斯性的關節病症，有腫脹及劇痛兩症象的。發生的關節部分，以腎，膝，和肩部關節，爲多。他的臨床上症象，是和尋常的僂麻質斯症相仿彿的。但對於水楊酸劑（急性僂麻質斯症之特效劑）的影響，遠沒有那樣大；心內膜炎癥新發生，也是狠鮮見的。在血液中·有時也可發現結核桿菌的。治療除結核症的本身治療外，其他與僂麻性斯症大致相同。</p>
<p>第八節　結核症與他症之連合</p>
<p>結核症和尋常幾種習見的病症，像梅毒糖尿病瘧症等，有時可連合同時進展的。這一種影響之爲優爲劣，以及洽療愈該特別注意的地方，我想也有一知的必要。現在且一一分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）結核與梅毒。這兩症的連合發生，比較是狠習見的；有先天性梅毒的小孩，同時兼患肺結核者，事實上的例子更多，不過沒有極準確的診斷罷了。如果在新發生的梅毒患者，同時發生結核了，則此種結核症，大半屬諸極端進行核性型式。患梅毒者是否易羅結核症一問題，則迄今還沒有完全解决的。如果三期的老梅毒患者有了結核了，則此種經過是否爲不良一層，也是說不定的。關於梅毒症的治療，也狠值得注意的。水銀劑的愈用，對於結核症是狠不合宜；但鉍剷的治療，是毫無不良影響的。六零六也無大關係，但用量須稍加考慮；碘齊在結核症方面也時常應用的那更加用不着捉了！</p>
<p>（二）結核與糖尿症。在結核症的過程中，糖尿症的發生，是不大會有的；反過來說，假使先有了糖尿症了，那末是比較容易講成的。這兩症的連合，對於預後方面，是更趨有惡劣的。我們曉得，關於糖尿病的治療治方針，是特殊注意飲食限制的，尤以含水炭素的食品，統减至而無可再减的，蛋白質有時也應該限制的。結核症是非常注重營養狀態的，幷且是兼收並蓄的，甚至有時因食慾之佳否，而揣測其預後情形的。醫者在此種狀態以下，而行適當治療方針，那不是和「兩姑之間難爲婦」一樣的碼？</p>

<h3>甯波金融風潮之回顧</h3>
<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>一　甯波金融市場的大槪</p>
<p>浙江有三大金融中心的城市：就是杭州，紹興，和甯波。紹興是生產的區域，而甯波和杭州則是近乎商業區。尤其是在上海未闢商埠之前，杭州跟甯波都佔有國際及國內商業上的重要地位。若單以杭州和甯波相比較，則杭州微近於都市，而甯波則是純粹的商業中心。</p>
<p>在宋代，甯波就有市舶司，管理國內外商船進出的事。因為在那時，甯波不論在水陸交通上都佔着相當的便利。</p>
<p>近世的甯波金融市場不能說不發達，有銀行，也有錢莊。中央，中國，交通，四明，等行，都在甯波設有辦事處或分行。但重心却在錢莊。甯波的錢莊有一種特殊的金融制度，就是大家都知道的過帳制。</p>
<p>什麽呌做過帳呢？過帳就是交換記帳的意思。大凡甯波的商場上欵項，其根據的單位，大多數是過帳。這種過帳的欵子，只能作為互相抵軋或登帳的標準，如果需要取現時，則須另外計算。例如甲商號收到一張乙莊的過帳票據，甲號可以交付任何金融機關去收帳，但是要乙莊付現，則必須另貼一種貼水。這種貼水，俗稱「現升」，他的高下，是根據現洋的供狀況而定的。</p>
<p>因此，在甯波辦貨有兩種行情，有過帳，有現洋，你上市去買貨，如果付以現欵，商店一定付還你相當的貼水，因為他們的定價是根據過帳洋的。</p>
<p>至於各錢莊的過帳方法，連如甲號應收乙號洋一千元，甲號的往來是A莊，乙號是B莊，兩號經過口頭接洽之後，各通知其往來錢莊。AB兩莊各將應收或應解的數目於過帳簿內，互相換簿子，互相核對，如相符，即過帳手續即了。等到夜裏，則由錢業公會將各莊的應收應付的過帳欵項加以清算。所以過帳制，實具票據交換所的雛形。</p>
<p>因為甯波是過帳的金融市場，對於欵項收付，都以過帳為代，所以現金的用途不繁。至於過帳洋用途之浩大，其地位實在上海的匯劃洋以上。</p>
<p>本文的目的，在研討這次金融風潮的因果，因此對過帳制度，只是一些簡略的敘述，好在學者們早已有很詳備的研究書籍出版，便是甯波的錢業公會也有一本「過帳須知」，備局外人參考的。</p>
<p>二　風潮的經過及原因分析</p>
<p>甯波這次風潮的引火綫，也由於上海的金融恐慌。六七月間，已有幾家小同行錢莊的停業。在七月三十日一天中，因漢口源裕銀號倒閉後，其中有幾家錢莊的股東跟前者有關，於是即起擠提存欵的風潮。但因為事出不備，各莊所吸收的欵項，多已變為放欵，因而周轉不靈，無法應付，只得宣告停業。但錢莊的股東或關係人因有連帶的關係，或者因為牌號的誤傳，在七月三十日一天中，又有大同行泰生，衍源，信源，的停業，泰源，永源，五源三莊的宣告清理。以後繼續有被擠倒閉者，全市大同行錢莊原有三十七家，僅存三分之二。</p>
<p>這次風潮的原因，可分下列說法：</p>
<p>（一）信用制度的動搖　原來過帳制度與過帳洋，不外是一種信用。在人心穩定的時候，對於票據的信任力強，故毋須經過掉換現金的手續，而得予以流轉。這種流轉，代替現金的效用不少。尤因過帳洋與現洋有貼水的關係，對於現金的需要上又加上一層制限。一般商社會為手續便利計，及利息的討打計，自然願意用過帳洋。現金的效用反在空間的一邊。因商業社會之信用過帳洋，其欵項的進出，也只在過帳的錢莊集團之內，故錢莊的力量更加雄厚。這一次因了整個信用制度的動搖，不但不信任錢莊，而且不信任過帳洋，演成資本逃避之趨勢。因之，其波動的範圍，乃為全體錢莊，而其所演出的風潮，也不僅在一隅。</p>
<p>（二）現底的缺乏　基於上述，甯波是過帳的金融制度，對於現金的應用不繁，因之在平時的現底存額不多。其所吸收的存欵，類多零星存戶，近乎儲蓄存欵，故其支出亦不多。甯波的錢莊極發達，而甯波的商業恰並不見如何進展，故其所吸收的資金，不能不轉放於外埠，所留存者無多。有此種種，信用制度一動搖，已放出的鉅額資金，大多數是定期的，一時不能收回；而平時不支取的存戶，卻一齊要支取現洋，這么一侵軋，就不得不宣告停業了。</p>
<p>（三）組織上的缺點　組織上的缺點，就是錢莊與股東在平時的欠檢點，這次風潮的原因，由於股東的信用動搖，牽連及於有關係的各莊，頗多累及無辜。所以各錢莊對於股東，以及股東對於錢莊，兩者實在太不協調了。因為錢莊是合夥組織，錢莊應該知道股東的能力，股東也應該體察本身的能力。如果股東自己知道不能負擔應負的責任，應該早日脫離了股東的名義，錢莊對於股東也應如此。要知道金融機關乃是金融制度中分子之一，決不能脫離而獨立。其所受的影響，也決不止本身而止，平時能夠懂得這一層意思，則臨變倉猝之舉，自可避免。</p>
<p>（四）應付方法之欠敏捷　說到應付的方法上，似乎也只在洽標的一方面。例如就六項辦法說，提現不得過一百元的舉動，對於人心的恐慌程度，是只有加深刻的。又如希望各銀行不收過帳存欵一點，也不見有什麽效驗。因為這種制限，徒然加甚資金逃出埠際的傾向而已。最適當的辦法，應該從金融機關的協調，和充實信用及現底的力量上着眼。當風潮初起的時候，錢莊本身能早一些加厚力量，政府方面一方面能早日消弭擠提的恐慌，則恐慌的範圍決不會有這樣的擴大的。</p>
<p>三　結論</p>
<p>就上面的情形來說，甯波的金融市場本來只是一種畸形的發展。因為甯波在商業上說來，是一個人超的口岸，靠着旅外人士的匯入欵項來彌補的。甯波金融機關吸收的資金，並不用之於甯波工商業之進展，反而流到外面去，這是一種失計。</p>
<p>近年農村極度衰落的結果，一般購買力也日趨低下，則金融狀態的枯竭，自然是理想中的事。在這裏，我們不能忽視一般小都市隨時有發現可能的恐慌性。</p>
<p>這一次甯波金融風潮，於各處的金融市場並不生若何影響。一般人以為甯波發生恐慌則存在各處的外埠欵項就須收回；其實這種存欵，就甯波說，固然是一種鉅額的放欵，而分散到各埠，只不過滄海的一粟而已。</p>
<p>我們所希望今後的甯波的金融機關者，是應當鞏固本身的信用組織，同時，不應該忽略金融事業與當地產業的連鎖性。　八月八日</p>

<p>這次甯波錢業風潮的經過，就各方面的消息，稍加整理，也可作為參考，且把牠彙述在下邊。</p>

<p>風潮的善後</p>
<p>甯波的錢莊，向來是很穩健的，縱偶有事故發生，都能安然的渡過難關。當淞滬二二八之時，甯波因昆連上海，受着了嚴重影響，然而終能不生風潮，也可為其穩健的明證。但是，近年來不景氣的日見深刻，使穩健的錢莊，發生空前的風潮。七月卅一日，縣政府以錢業為工商領袖，兩天來倒閉達七家，影響於社會金融至鉅。代電甯波商會，妥籌善後的具體辦法。並同時布告，即日起，存戶過賬，數目不論多少，照舊過劃；支取現幣，暫定一百元，以示限制。八月二日在甯波商會，召集銀錢業代表，開緊急會議，當場議決六項辦法：（二）各莊公單，不得逾十五萬元，如當日過進者，有逾十五萬元，其超過者，歸同業分拆，由同業共同負責。（二）自即日起，存戶提取存欵，每戶每日不得逾一百元，已經縣府佈告，各莊應共同遵守。（三）錢業公會會員，如認某莊缺單過多，得隨時調查其拆單數目，遇必要時，得令其墊本。（四）請本埠各銀行，暫時不收過賬存欵。（五）函請中央，中國，交通二銀行，合借國幣二百萬元，以資救濟。（六）已停業各莊，即日復業，過劃照常辦理；並將收付賬略，抄送商會審查，轉呈縣政府察核。一面各股東儘力增墊股本，一面各存戶之欵，暫緩提取。翌日錢業公會亦開會通過商會所議決之六項辦法。至四日大同行十一莊，一律復業，小同行十一家和現兌莊四家，亦在整飭內部，重振旗鼓，而空前風潮，頓告平息。</p>

<p>據上表，自去年年底至今年六月底止，上海現銀進口為一五，四二〇，〇〇〇元，出口為二〇，〇一〇，〇〇〇元，二者相抵，出超四，五九〇，〇〇〇元。在進口方面，由國外輸入者為七，六四〇，〇〇〇元，由國內各埠運進者為七，七八〇，〇〇〇元。在出口方面，輸出國外者為八五〇，〇〇〇元，輸至沿海各埠者為九，六一〇，〇〇〇元，輸至內地各埠者為九，五五〇，〇〇〇元，此處吾人應特加注意者，為在進口方面，由國外輸入者，幾佔進口總額之半，而在出口方面輸出國外者，僅佔出口總額百分之四，以兩者之實數相比，尚由國外入超六，七九〇，〇〇〇元。此種現象初視之殊為可喜。蓋當此美國白銀政策正在進行之中，而上海對外白銀出入，竟得入超，這豈不是美國白銀政策已不為害中國了嗎？其實不然，今年上海所以能有大量現銀由國外流入者，正是為中國現銀存底受美國白銀政策之影響，外流幾盡，而引起上海金融的大恐慌。吾財政當局及金融界為維持計，忍痛拋出大量黃金，由倫敦及香港二處，用高價換回白銀，以資周轉，所以今年上海外銀之流入，乃是一種人為的現象，於中國並無甚利益，實際上尚受損失。（因為在購買外銀時銀價正在極高峯，而現在已漸低落）輸出國外之白銀，由表面看來，為數固微，但稍加考察，則知其不然。半年來上海現銀輸至沿海各埠者，幾佔輸出總額之半，此數皆有偷運國外之可能。蓋以商業之關係而言，上海對沿海各埠立於貿易出超之地位，按理沿海各埠現銀應流入上海，而今上海現銀及流至沿海各埠，　此實為一種不合理之現象。故今年上海白銀運往沿海各埠之目的，亦可想見一斑矣。再就地理上之關係而言，天津位處華北，因有北寗鐵路之便利，某國浪人遂大事偷運現銀出關，此種事件已屢見報端。至於廈門·福州·青島·烟台·等處，亦為某國勢力之活動範圍，故吾政府雖嚴令禁止。但偷運之風，仍未稍　，由此觀之。上海運往沿海各埠之九，六一〇，〇〇〇元現銀，實際上皆偷運國外矣。再加上直接運往國外之八五〇，〇〇〇元，則佔輸出總數百分之五十四，為數之鉅，實足驚人。至於半年來由上海運往內地之白銀，九百五十餘萬元。則僅佔輸出總額百分之四十六，即實數亦不過九百五十五萬元而已，當此復興內地之際，此數實嫌過少。</p>
<p>由上述各節歸納起來，吾人應加以注意者，有以下幾點：</p>
<p>（一）半年來上海現銀存底雖有增加之勢，但較諸去年同期，和去年年底則相差遠甚，而至五月以後，又有趨減之傾向。</p>
<p>（二）半年來上海現銀存底之增加，乃為洋商銀行存底增加所造成，而華商銀行存底反較前減少。</p>
<p>（三）上海現銀仍有鉅額之出超，而輸出之方向，仍以流往國外者（包含沿海各埠偷運之數）較流至內地者為多。</p>
<p>凡此種種現象對於吾國經濟上，金融上，皆屬極端不利，故吾人對於半年來上海現銀存底之變動，殊覺悲觀。</p>
<p>以上海金融季節的變動而論，上半年為現銀流進時期，存底豐富，市面鬆弛。下半年為現銀流出時期，存底減少，市面緊縮。而今年上半年上海的現銀已有大量流出，存底已經枯竭，市面非常吃緊，那末，下半年上海金融恐慌，若不及時根本解濟。則其嚴重之程度，更不堪設想。現在讓我們引用銀行公會秘書長林康侯先生的話。以作本文的結束：林君謂「本市金融狀況，經財政部及銀錢業竭力救濟，上半年安然渡過，表面上已趨安定，但實際上危機仍深，以往救濟，尚屬治標，以後須着重治本，否則，不免崩潰。」現在我們只有翹盼「治本」的辦法早日實現！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於「純文學」</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>當戈恬（Theaphile　Gautier）百年祭之際，紀德（Andre　Gide）對於這作家，曾寫下一篇短短的評論，開頭說：</p>
<p>「對於戈恬的『爲藝術的藝術』這理論，我不想加以非難，除此以外，我不知道有什麼別的存在的理由。不過，他把藝術壓縮得只能表現出這麼些少的東西，那是不行的」。</p>
<p>這話總算是公平的了。</p>
<p>旣爲藝術，當然不能叫它不爲藝術，但是一定要使藝術從人生超脫，從現實游離，「架空」地只成爲「技巧的美」，只能表現「剎那間的經騐」，這實在把藝術的容積壓縮得太小了。</p>
<p>所謂「純文學」，便是爲藝術的藝術」之一種。倫敦大學英文文學敎授Lascelles　Abercrombie在所著文學批評原理的第二節中，論純文學的原理，說純文學乃是用文字傳達純經騐的藝術，而那種經騐是「其本身卽有可享用的價值的」純經騐（Pure　Experience）。「譬如以看風景而論，若我是個農人，我就按照風景的實用價值而下批評：我自己想，我所看見的是否一塊可耕種的好地皮。在另一方面，我也可以僅用這種觀賞風景的經騐，而使我極感滿足，並不發生任何問題。我所感得的只是這風景美麗得很。當我這樣感知時，我所經騐的事物便成爲『曾有過樣的經騐』而大大地使我滿足了。我若把這種感覺表現出來，我的表現並無什麼目的，若我的表現是用文字表達出來的，其結果便是文學了」。</p>
<p>這論調，跟「爲藝術的藝術」和唯美主義之類的論調是一樣的。</p>
<p>照這論調，古往今來的世界名著，泰半不是文學作品，因為歷來的名著，泰半倒是不僅表現着剎那間的美麗快樂的經騐，而也提示着人生的根本的問題的</p>
<p>然而據Abercrombie敎授的說法，則在另一方面，可以說是純文學的作品又很多。他舉了吉彭（Giblon）所著的「羅馬帝國的興亡史」一書說道：</p>
<p>「這書，若將其史實是否正確或說明是否可靠之點拋開不管，而僅把它當作顯現於想像中的富麗堂皇的故事看，當然是一本很好的純文學作品了，因爲此書的表現力是很好的……我們若把實用之學的作品也當作純文學看，必須把作者的目的餘開不管，換言之，凡此種作者是認爲達到目的的手段或工具，我們　認爲目的的本身。但是在純文學中，　無此將作者的目的除外的必要；因爲　了表現的本身外，純文學並無任何目的。」</p>
<p>但問手段，不問目的，但論形式，不論內容，這種見解，跟奮時中國文人對於文字的見解是十分符合的。莊子是文學，因爲它寫得好，孟子是文學，因爲它寫得好，史記漢書是文學，元非因爲它們的表現力好，而它們的哲學，政論，歷史的價值却被无視了。</p>
<p>這樣的純文學論爲是很可怪的，它將明是文學作品的作品擯諸文學之外，却把並非文學作品的作品圈到文學之中；它不但把文學和現實拆開，拋撇了現實，並把作品的內容和形式拆開，拋撇了內容。最可怪的是它本興「爲藝術的藝術」的論點同源，結局却完全否定了「爲藝術的藝術論」：吉彭，莊周，孟軻班，馬的著作本來絕對不是「爲藝術的藝術」啊！</p>
<h3>中年</h3>
<p>— 小皎</p>
<p>最近一家都輾轉在病魔中。先是孩子病，一天吵到晚，妻子在夜裏總要起牀五六次。接着就是妻子病了。現在連我也倒下來啦。</p>
<p>載着一個沉重的頭，我還要替病着的孩子哼自己也不曉得的什麼歌曲，一面還抱着他踱來踱去地走。這麼着，有時候自己倒覺得這是一件最勝任的同時也是一件最恰當的工作。</p>
<p>於是一個嚴重的問題襲擊我的心境了。</p>
<p>究竟自己是要靠自己的力氣混飯吃的，要是這樣病下去，醫治可以不必說起，速吃飯立刻就要發生問題了。怎麼辦呢</p>
<p>我燃着燈，我睡不着了。孩子的蒼白的臉橫在我的手臂上，嘴裏不斷地喘着氣，燈一亮，他一驚，乏力地啼哭起來。妻子也給我吵醒了，用嘎聲的喉嚨安慰我：</p>
<p>『不要煩吧！要是在上海活不下去，我們决計退到鄉下去，難道爸爸和媽媽會趕出我們嗎？睡吧，還是睡吧，冬。』</p>
<p>我並不理會她，我還是開着眼睛想我的。我記得一位朋友曾經對我說過，有了孩子，自己就不能再做孩子了。是的，我現在還有父母，總算還可以做一下自己父母的孩子。要是父親跟母親都死了呢？於是我又想起，我少時候死了祖父的那一年，我的父親曾經服過水銀自殺，當別人發覺，驚慌地問他：</p>
<p>「那是，那是爲了什麼？」</p>
<p>「沒有什麼，」他却淡淡然笑着，「人一到中年以後，實在還是睡着來得快活！」</p>
<p>從這一次解救以後，眞的，父親永遠是昏沈沈睡在酒裏了。</p>
<p>這情景，從前我一點也不會了解，現在我是領悟了。如果，在這生活綫上，後面沒有我的一個退路，今夜，我也許也要用着水銀了。</p>
<p>彷彿法朗士說過，人生宛若一條橋，中年人正像走到橋頂一樣，發展到最高峯，他開始要衰頹了。（大意是如此吧。）不錯，我現在正是立在橋頂上。在橋的這一邊，看我的孩子慢慢地在爬上來；在橋的那一邊看父親敗北地在蹌下去。我的形勢正好像是用右手把孩子拉上來，用左手把父親早點推下去。在父親，却是疲勞地負着我們兩個，不曉得引到那裏的烏何有之鄉去了。</p>
<p>於是，我又想到我自己。等到我的孩子走到橋頂的時候，我將會怎樣呢？啊，不能想。我的人生已經發展到最高峯，人世巳經給與我一個「型」了，而這個「型」的發展的終極，原來是如此呀！要是再衰頹下去，那將會……，不，我不願再想下去，我怕！朋友，讓我休息吧，我怕啊，我怕這一類型的尖銳化！</p>

<p>— 舒江</p>
<p>唪完晚經，夕陽也殘了，</p>
<p>佛堂掩臥着懶困的經卷。</p>
<p>鐘鈸聲早已寂滅，</p>
<p>濃厚的香烟在佛像前緩緩地迥旋。</p>
<p>但她擾起了的心再也不能安靜，</p>
<p>看着一瓣瓣的落花吁氣了。</p>
<p>了着愈發焦燥，</p>
<p>臉上飛起片片的紅暈。</p>
<p>心中似乎有小鳥撲撲地跳躍，</p>
<p>閉了眼，手緊緊地壓着胸脯。</p>
<p>希望晚風吹消臉上和心頭的熱，</p>
<p>但，不成。她跑回去，伏在床頭啜泣了！</p>
<h3>可以居里（上）</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>『可以居」的第一個尊貴的老茶客史董事像幽靈一般地竟進來的時候，當爐子阿根正屁股冲得高高地扇爐于，他沒有留意；不，他不預料史董事會這末早就上茶館來。</p>
<p>史董事照例在當窗的籐椅上坐下，微微喘着氣，額角上也冒着一層細小的汗珠，彷彿他撤腿跑過一陣路，或者斷了一件公案什麼似的。但是他强自鎭定着，從天藍夏布的窄小袖筒里抽出一方摺疊成荳腐乾那樣大小的絹帕來，他有禮貌地抹了汗珠，重謹愼地藏到袖簡管·於是用那生着一寸來長指甲的手指在白木桌上敲出一陣低微地有着音樂節奏的響聲——這舉動表示有一件重大的公案正像一條蛇咬着他的心；五家鎭上的居民只要瞧見過史　事的面就沒有一個人不曉得這「决竅」，阿根自然是看得挺多的一個。但是這一陣子他却嚇得跳了起來，嘴里粗野地駡着見鬼，眼角里巳飄上了那個拉長了臉的尊貴底客人；這一來他不知怎樣去掩飾自己的過失！掌自己一個重重的巴掌吧，心里想着時史董事却開口了：</p>
<p>「阿根，昨天什麼時候打烊的？」</p>
<p>史董事一點沒有怒意，從桌面上抽回右手來抹着那兩撇不成樣的鬚子。史董事自己也知道這個缺憾，但是做董事不留鬚子更不是個「體統」；所以只要有什麼重大心事時他就下意識地去抹那兩撇鬚子，好像那鬚子底不成樣和他的心事多少有一點牽聯關係似的。</p>
<p>阿根低着頭，預防着大禍臨頭的樣子，但是那問句是淸淸楚楚的「阿根，昨天什麼時候打烊的」？他的單純的頭腦中一時相不出這和我阿根駡了句「見鬼」有什麼關係，就被那個「關係」想呆了忘了應該先回答史董事的問話。</p>
<p>「是不是老辰光」？</p>
<p>史董事今天眞是好說話，他抹鬚子抹得更有勁了；一邊又像用他鏡利的目光在阿根面上搜尋一點什麼似的。</p>
<p>「是的。史老爺」！呌着史老爺的時候，阿根像一架鷄吃食的玩具，他總要先灣一灣腰。但是心里還老忖着那「關係」。</p>
<p>「後來有人來過嗎」？</p>
<p>這聲音有點審公案的樣子了，在阿根耳朶里彷彿響了一個雷</p>
<p>「沒有！沒有！史老爺」！阿根一連灣着腰，像眞有個響雷在他頭頂上盤旋一般不敢抬起頭來。</p>
<p>「眞的？」史老爺再釘緊了一句，才吩咐阿根冲茶來。</p>
<p>這太使阿根摸不着頭腦，他伸手到擱板下摸着那把紫沙茶壺的時候，他忽然想起狸猫換太子中包公審石頭的情形。史老爺問「打烊」一定有道理，史老爺用那種…那種…阿根呌不出來的方法，要審一件離奇的公案了。但是我阿根是出名的好人，和我打烊有什麼「關係」？不過那聲「見鬼」史老爺一定沒有聽見。心里一寬，他特別在茶壺里多加了幾朶代代花，並且揀了一裝（註一）最高的靑條（註二）捧到史老爺面前來。</p>
<p>「史老爺做幾個燒餅？」</p>
<p>其實這是阿根的多問，他不過想特別獻殷勤而己。史董事每天在「可以居」吃兩個燒餅，在五家鎭上已成了故事。譬如某家的小孩子那天特別多化了幾枚銅元，爺老子管敎起來一定要舉出「史老爺一天祇吃兩個燒餅」的話。</p>
<p>但是史董事搖搖頭，這顯然又有什麼「關係」了。他用指甲在桌上又敲了一陣，一如寫墓碑，壽文之類的時候敲着腦袋，敲呀鼓的有分把來鐘，才掌心在桌面上一擗，雖然不及阿根冲一口痰那麼有勁，在讀書人已經是有失「體統」的舉動了。不過阿根是不懂得那些「斯文」派頭的，他呆呆地站在桌邊，什麼都不是地拉開了嘴巴</p>
<p>史老爺重從袖筒里取出那方荳腐干的手帕來，現在他不是抹汗，手帕從右手遞到左手，左手遞到右手，那樣子像女人家玩弄衣角一樣有些不好意思。又是分把來鐘，壓低蒼老的喉音對阿根說，那樣溫柔，差一點他要舉起手來拍拍阿根的肩頭。</p>
<p>「你知道那阿興小鬼回來的消息嗎？」</p>
<p>那個阿興？阿根幾乎要疑心史老爺今天發神經病了，那些話頭都是阿根想不出方法來答復的。開烊什麼，阿興什麼，却不想吃燒餅，包公審石頭也不是這個樣子的。</p>
<p>「就是那個陸家里的小鬼阿興。」史老爺明白阿根摸不着頭路，補了一句。</p>
<p>「噢，那個×××…」</p>
<p>「別鬧！」史老爺這才像個活包公，面色烏靑的：「問你知道不知道，不許亂說！」</p>
<p>阿根祇有搖頭的份兒，他肚子里的什麼什麼關係一股兒嚇了個乾凈。</p>
<p>「不知道就是了。」</p>
<p>這時候門外走進兩個人來，史董事知道這樣一個局面要引起人家疑心的，就這麼說了，彷彿告訴阿根不要儘把腦袋開着機器似的搖個不停。</p>
<p>進來的客人咳着嗽，這又是「讀書人」的派頭，將入戶，聲必揚，「可以居」裏都是些斯文的茶客，不過史董事今天進「可以居」像一個倫鷄賊般地閃進來的，他沒有咳嗽，是他想着另一件事，忘了這派頭的。</p>
<p>阿根無論再笨得像一根木頭，他聽咳嗽的經騐是有的，他立即車轉身子，灣着腰喊了一陣老爺。</p>
<p>史董事故意推着茶杯出神，等到兩位老爺走到他桌子旁側問候「董事早？」的時候，他才裝做怱忙的樣子放了茶杯，站起身來，用右手掌抱着左手的拳頭，像在神前求籤的善男信女一樣，牽了幾牽，說：「慕老，蓮老，早？」</p>
<h3>如此如此</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生作</p>
<h3>海邊的悲劇（一）</h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>從娜克羅亦錫克（Lecroisie）到拔突期鎭的一條小路，並不是一條被踏得堅實的小路；一陣微風掠過，就會抹去車輸遺下的凹痕或馬蹄的足跡。但我們的嚮導的有經騐的目光，能够賴牲畜的脚跡，和羊糞來尋覓這條路的所在。這條小路，按照着陸地的形勢和它所環繞的盤石的位置，有些地方低下去通於海，有些地方高上去達於田。</p>
<p>那是中午時分，我們還只走了一半的旅程。</p>
<p>『我們可以到那邊休憇一會兒，』我說，手指着那羣石矗立的山崖。那兒看上去我們似乎可以尋出一處幽隱之所。</p>
<p>當那位漁夫，他的目光隨着我手指的方向看去，聽見我這句話的時候，他搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>『那兒有一個人！每一個行人從拔突斯到娜克羅亦錫克或是從娜克羅亦錫克到拔突斯，當常繞道而行，以免經過他的面前。』</p>
<p>漁夫用低低的調講這些話，這樣的語調，立即引起了神秘之感。</p>
<p>那末他是一位强盜，還是一位刺客？</p>
<p>我們的嚮導（指漁夫）僅有的回答，是一個深長而空泛的驚嘆，這更增加了我們的好奇心。</p>
<p>『但是，假如我們果眞從那邊走過我們會遭遇意外麼？』</p>
<p>「啊，那不會。』</p>
<p>『你願意和我們一塊兒去麼？』</p>
<p>『不，先生。』</p>
<p>『哎，假使你能擔保我們此去沒有什麼危險的話，我們一定要去。』</p>
<p>『話不是這樣講，』漁人很快的回答着。『我僅僅知道坐在那邊的人，一定不和你們攀談一句話，也不侖傷害你們。他必然絲毫不動的坐在原來的位置上。』</p>
<p>『那末他究竟是什麼樣的人呢？』</p>
<p>『一個男人！』</p>
<p>我平生從沒有聽見過用這樣悲慘的聲調來講這句話的。那時我們離開那海水澎拼的小灣約有二十步。我們的嚮導擇定了那條環繞着盤石的大道，我們向我們的前面一直走去。但是包玲緊挽着我的臂膀，我們的響導爲要達到那兩條小路交义而同時也是我們要聚頭的地方，放快了步子向前。他顯明地揣想到我們瞥見了那人以後，我們必得很快的走上去。這種情形引動我們的好奇心，這種好奇心非常蓬勃地燃熾起來，我們的心跳得很厲害，好像我們已經給一種恐怖的感情所襲擊似的。</p>

<h3>馮玉祥蒸饅頭救濟災民</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>防水救災，算是中國當前一個重要的工作。這工作政府當局固然責無旁貨，全國國民更應一致援助。馬相伯先生就出來大聲疾呼，力勸國人節約拯災。但到現在，國人眞能發動惻隱之心的，尙不多見。故除非是利用「娛樂救國」的方法，演幾天戲或跳一回舞，才可以得一筆欵子。否則要等國人自動慷慨解囊，那只好讓那些災民去吃樹皮草根。不過當仁不讓的亦並不是沒有。近日南洋華僑匯欵來助賑的。已有幾個。愛護祖國，華僑的確是最熱心的。</p>
<p>先日送報的送來一份報紙，裏面誤夾一張「大公報，」我略為一翻，竟給我看到這樣一則消息：（泰安通信）本縣收容鄆城濟寗災民千餘人，收容所多在北山坡一帶，連日馮玉祥氏，蒸就大批棗饅頭，派潘廷璽率衛士於淸晨運至各所，每人分給二枚，並囑不得驚動管理處人員，亦不得使災民知為馮氏所送，現已數日，始漸為人所悉云。</p>
<p>自然，救國工作是人人應努力的·我並不說馮先生的蒸饅頭分給災民，是怎樣値得特別稱贊，也不說馮先生所蒸的饅頭，是由自己節約而來的。人我佩服的是，馮先生的救災工作，實在幹得最切實際。他明白救濟災民，是急不容緩的。故他要救災，並不把錢捐到任何慈善機關去。因為這太費事，遠水救不得近火。他就每日蒸一批饅頭，派人運至各收容所去分發。二枚饅頭原不算什麽，但鄆城濟寗那一千餘災民，却已受賜不淺。</p>
<p>各地災民之嗷嗷待哺的，何止幾百萬。國人之有能力蒸饅頭的，將怎樣去救濟他們呢？</p>
<h3>山居小唱</h3>
<p>— 吉</p>
<p>（「夏天的山裏是艷麗的調色盤，這裏有綠油油的灌木林，有金黃色的野花，有朱紅的李子，有碧色的瓜，山是紫的，雲，當反照着太陽的時侯，是奢侈地鍍了金的！夏天的山裏，也是一堂演奏着最偉大最紛雜的交響曲的音樂會啊，在這裏，野鶯的嗓子是高音的，像潤滑的溪水一樣，一勁兒流到了靑春的尖端；在另一邊嘰咕着的是老了的烏鴉啊，用若最低音的聲調，像老敎士一樣地唱出了老年的沈寂，而，或者你也喜歡午夜小谷裏的鴟鳥的怪僻的經文吧，這，也許是啟發了宇宙間的星星的神秘，也許會告訴你地獄裏的幽靈的消息，你是會喜歡它們的，也許？夏天的山裏是自然界的聲與色的大集合，它，正像一本向你開展若的大書，把人世問的一切都儘量地向你叙述了：艷麗與沈鬱的，靑春與老年的；人有勇氣看生活，人一定也有勇氣愛夏天的山的。也許給在大都會中的汽油與打字機把心境毁了吧？找一機會到山裏來住幾時，從這兒，你是會重又獲得失去了的自己的！而况，又是夏天了啊……」）</p>
<p>彷彿一陣凉雨打了來似地；從朋友這美麗得如同夢一般的山裏的叙述中，我愕然地驚醒了：是夏天，已經是夏天了啊！</p>
<p>明白的：在這都會裏飄泊若過日子的人，不是該被嘲笑的麼？「他們是祇能記得月頭月尾，而沒有權利來留意季節的推移的」；然而，生活支配人滯留在一種凝固的區域裏，這可不是千眞萬確，而不容易更動，不充許妄想的嗎？</p>
<p>但，山是可愛的，夏天也是可愛的呀！一想到在打字機前面流汗的難　，我竟連夜夢見了夏日的深深的山林，已經是不止一兩次了。</p>
<p>終於，鼓了一口氣，對生活冒了一次小小的險，暫時別過了都會中的被晒得軟化了的柏油大街，我向着靜寂的，幽深而親熟的山裏去了。</p>
<p>在那兒，太陽永遠像中世紀的東方的閨女，羞怯地濾過繁密的樹枝的空罅，而溫文地灑落在靑石鋪成的山路上的，於是，人在金光閃耀的鋪道上延曲折地走向遼遠的前面去……</p>
<p>生長在山裏的，該誰多不會忽略這一個情境的吧：黃昏與淸晨，四週昇起的是一層柔軟的，輕淡的薄霧，在朦朧的天光裏，把太陽裏的赤金色與山的開靑調和起來，合成了一種柔味的紫色的烟，紗一般地輕籠了這山，這樹，這疏淡安閒的人家，這永無休北地流若的山泉水。</p>
<p>山裏的日子是偸偸地溜過去的——是永遠瞞着人而溜過去的：走一個圈子，向年老的鄰人們學一點種樹墾土的動作，聽他們談生活上與年成上的不如意，一笑，一憂慮，那麽着，來到了黃昏，來到了夜，來到了第二個早晨……</p>
<p>而况是夏天把由裏盛裝了起來，眞的是雜色的嗚奏曲啊。夏天是豐盛的，夏　的山也是豐盛的，大自然的色與聲在那兒集合起來，而且伴着一切的果物一同地，豐滿地成熟了，</p>
<p>一切都成熟了，整個的山！而跟着，愛山的，生長在深鬱的山林裏的人們，也許會在這一顆單純的心裏同樣地滋長了一點什麽，而且，伴着這整個的山而成熟了，而豐盛了！</p>
<p>愛山的人，是把山當做大自然的寳藏的啊！</p>
<h3>二等車廂</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>旅途散記</p>
<p>因為自己的職業關係，可以說得終年在鐵軌上奔波，但是像一個高貴的紳士一樣跨進二等車廂去，這是破例兒第一遭。事先，公司里的一位朋友預備與我同行，由他弄得兩張二等車的半價券，郤為了特殊關係他在上一天先走了。在我踏上車廂的時候，我想着舅父的病狀是否能如人們預計着的有「起色」，很有把握的事往往會得着相反的結果的。</p>
<p>坐定身沒有一分鐘，火車開行了。二等車廂中不滿十個旅客，每個人都佔了兩個人的座位，像躺在沙發里一樣地側轉身來翻着當天的報紙或是雜誌之類，一邊呼着捲烟，跟着車身的震激，彷彿一個搖籃里的孩子一樣；他們就微微盍上眼，領略旅途上特有的情趣。自己雖然被稱為「老出門」的，但是在這一點上我的經騐是太不够了。我時常敬吿同事們上火車切莫帶報紙，我們應該時時注意若自己携帶的行李。你想利用這時間來讀報，車上沒有坐在寫字台上舒服，顚簸得利害的時候，你决看不出報上印的是什麼新聞，如果被人家帶走了你的一件行李，這損失是足够後悔一輩子的。但是這經騐應甩到二等車廂中來，是完全失敗了。這里比坐在寫字台上更舒服，在悠長的旅途中你一定要想一點什麽來消遣，我的手提箱中就從來沒有擱過一張卽是幾天前的報紙。於是我想到那個提高嗓子在人叢中擠出擠進的傢伙，我每次遇見他，他沒有一次不問我要買報？現在需要他的時候，那傢伙不知他在開車之前跳上火車沒有？</p>
<p>一個穿白制服的僕歐進來了，他手里捧着一個特製的木盤，放着十來盃淸茶，走過每個客人面前，不分由說地放上這末一盃，那態度郤比之三等車中「先生，泡一壺茶？」要好看得多。走過我面前，自然不會放空這一盃的。在那樣無聊的時候，我所能挨磨時刻的是只有抽烟和喝茶了，所以心中很想拒絕他這盃不必要的茶，郤沒有說出口來。我望着在白磁碟下這盃淸澄的茶，望着一辮辮的茶葉浮沉，就遐想到一個人在社會中的大概也是那個樣子打着盤旋，在目前景物漸漸模糊的時候，或許我跌入人生的深淵中去了。</p>
<p>我就此這樣睡過去許多時候，眞是做夢都想不到的事；出門人應當時時提防着自己，我是初次那樣大意，忘了自已在旅途之上。還是那尖鉅的汽笛聲把我催醒來，已經過了好幾個碼頭，我的對面不知什麼時候來了位摩登小姐：她的右手指技巧地夾著一枝烟捲，抬高了頭，注意着自家吐出來的烟圈，彷彿考慮着一件棘手的事情那樣凝神。見我醒來，她就忙若收拾台上散亂着的報章，烟捲，奶油蛋糕，水菓，還有幾冊花花綠綠的色情畫報。她顯得那樣手足無措，抱歉地向我點了點頭，把我的茶盃送到我的面前。這樣，，使得我也有些不好意思，我隨意還了禮，舉起我的茶盃來，郤已溫了。她似乎特別注意着我的舉動，立卽推過她的茶盃，並且授我一枝捲烟。我想推却，但是說不來一句客氣的話我是那樣地率直的，普通在朋友之間我從來不曉得客氣那樣東西。然而現在當前的是一個不認識的女人，我更不知道應該說什麼好。在沒有辦法的情形下，我接過她的烟放到台上，馬上站起身來到厠所去，再裝做不在意的樣子在另一個座位上坐了。但是我的目光投到我的那個手提箱的地方，另一男子佔了我原來的座位，並且他們談着什麽的非常親熱，那女子故意高聲笑着，彷彿向什麽入示威。</p>
<p>這一次我眞開了眼界，二等車廂與三等車的分畛把我「老出門」的經騐打了個粉碎，於是我更奢望下次有機會到頭等車廂去看看是什麽情形。</p>
<h3>籠鳥</h3>
<p>— 達雲</p>
<p>記得兒時，便異樣歡喜玩着動物，家里養着一頭灰白的猫，一頭黑狗，整天除了吃飯睡覺之外，差不多大部分的時間都消磨在逗着猫和狗玩耍。家里還有三隻公鷄，四隻母鷄，母鷄生了蛋，視母便把牠蓄積起來，逢着兄弟們的誕日，總有分到四只鷄蛋任憑自己煮當點心。我和二哥常常各人捉着一隻母鷄，兩手把牠緊抱，吐一口捶沫在地上，抱着母鷄不斷地打旋轉，然後用力將牠莊在涶沫的上面，那末，暫時被我們作耍子的母鷄縱是放開手也走不脫了，要是誰的母鷄先走動，就是誰的本領小。可是，這種把戲，玩着也漸漸感到乏味，那時我的腦海里浮着一種希企，希望着養一隻美麗的小鳥，那才開心哩！</p>
<p>不久，慈愛的祖母總是那麼順從兒孫們的意志，購給我一只嬌小伶俐的秀眼鳥，光亮的綠羽，金黄的腹，活潑潑地在籠里儘情的跳躍，叫着淸脆悅耳的歌曲，我們實在高興極了，連吃飯也不肯輕易離開牠，我們珍愛牠如同珍愛自己的生命！大家輪流着省點　　的錢來供給牠的食料。以後我達到上學的年齡</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，早晨上學，要晚上方才回家，我把飼養的責任交給小梅，但每天總還放不下心，在講堂上聽先生講解，老是想起家里的那只伶俐的小鳥來。</p>
<p>那已是放年假的年節了，母親也從學校里搬回家里，母子有了廝守的機會，我那小小的心得到無限的快慰。也許是這個緣故，我漸漸對那籠里的小鳥淡漠起來，而且母親向來極端反對養鳥，尤其是養在籠里的鳥，她以爲那是一椿太殘酷的事情，小籠里不就是人間的牢獄嗎？人爲了自己的一點歡悅，不惜剝奪鳥的自由，那未免太於殘酷呵！</p>
<p>一天，我正和母親在朋友家里玩了回來，小梅一看見我便烟也似的躱到角落里去，這事情使我有點茫然，於是我追請着她，她像老鼠碰見猫兒般顫抖着，怕我盛怒起來會拿起藤條子抽打她。祖母總是息事寗人的，她一面責備小梅不應該做事不當心，一而吿訴我那籠里的鳥如何被小梅弄逃走了。她說過幾天再買一隻更美麗的給我，她簡直是在哄我，意思是要免了小梅的一頓藤條子，我雖則年紀小，可早就洞穿了祖母的意思了。母親也打哈哈地來替她說情，其實，自從母親放假回家之援，我早就不若從前的悄形般拾不得籠里的小鳥了。大家正在叨叨嘮嘮的時候，二妹嘻嘻地走來吿訴我，那小鳥在屋援的桃樹下，血淋淋地淌着蠻可怕，何媽說是剛才被阿黑追着咬了一口，幸而過着她，被她呼叱才不會被吞噬下去。這消息頓時使我們都覺驚奇，我瞧牠那慘死的情景，妻凉的氛氣佔住了我的心，眼眶里包含着滿盈盈的淚水，撲簌簌地躺下來。</p>
<p>這椿過了整整二十個年頭的事跡；直到現在還淸淸楚楚地印在腦海里。然而，環境的變遷，十年來飽嘗了社會殘酷的滋味，回顧自身，幾何不同籠鳥般的被剝奪了意志，失却了活　　的自由呢！</p>

<p>多情却是總痴情。薄命紅顏自古云。堪歎倩女離魂後。瀟湘到處不生春。怡紅公子子情難盡。哭吊靈前表寸心。但見那。草木凋零聲寂寂。妻凉滿目影沉沉。　鵡不知心緒事。喃喃詩誦葬花聲。見鞍自必當思馬。睹物焉能不想人。妹妹呀你。絕世才容今已渺。空留遺物面前存。祇望與你常相伴。誰知那。萬事由天不由人。可憐你自小多磨折。可憐你抱恨赴幽冥。想當初靑梅竹馬同遊戯。到今日耳鬢斯磨再不能。想當初玩月賞花聯詩句。到今日狂歌作賦再不能。想當初兩心相印多親愛。到今日形影相隨再不能。想當初你一頻一笑無限好。到今日欲見音容再不能。我今靈前頻默訴。你在九泉可知聞。悲切切。淚紛紛。如醉如痴欲斷魂。這眞是富貴榮華如春夜。人人聚台等秋雲。到不如跳出煩惱地。從此割斷這不了情。做個逍遙世外人。</p>
<p>唐竹坪落金扇</p>
<p>華光（一四八〇）下午三時至三時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「簡神童刺梁」</p>
<p>漢朝梁冀大奸臣。獨掌威權裏外驚。猛聽相家言一句。居然無處不留神。團團護衛嚴巡守。刻刻提防刺客臨。三尺童兒難出入。只許。歌姬一班唱怡情。河東緊急文書到。家將投來轉斗門。自家剪燈判分明。忽見燈前影閃爍。來了。杜橋李固兩忠魂。朦朦伏案沉沉睡。頃刻迥避衆家了。往來恐怕夢魂驚。飛霞是。殺父之仇怨忿久。故而混作歌姬隊裏人。時交四鼓無人在。切齒咬牙恨氣伸。有志竟成從來道。手持三寸釘門針。一旦能酬孝女心</p>

<h3>Yellow River Course Unpredictable; Major Surge Upstream Yesterday; Strong Flow Directly Impacts Zhukou, Then Subsides in the Afternoon; Water Level of Weishan Lake Increases; Dangerous Situation; Gradually Stabilizes in the Evening; Ying Shan Embankment Collapses for Several Zhang</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, the Yellow River rose sharply. The major surge upstream directly impacted Zhukou. All seven stone dams were affected by the water, and the scouring was very rapid, making the situation extremely dangerous. If Zhukou collapses, there is a risk that Cao County will revert to the old course. The upstream surge has subsided this afternoon. If the Shaanxi River does not rise again, there may be no danger.

However, its tenth dam has recently been affected by the drawdown from the breach, and the surge is exceptionally fierce. All five, three, and seven sweeping points have either been moved or destroyed. The dam foundation has collapsed by four to five zhang. In the future, the breach will undergo changes. The Quancheng people are risking their lives to protect the tens of thousands of hectares of farmland in the Hetao area. Currently, the Dongzhuang breach has a large flow that is closely pressed against the embankment. The southern section has collapsed by dozens of zhang. The Heze Zhaowang Qili and other rivers have all overflowed, flooding many villages. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Telegram from Linjiaba: The Jingshan levee was breached by water last night. The villagers worked hard to block it, so that the slight water still followed the Yan River and exited through the Lanjiaba opening, discharging into the Jing River, to avoid flooding. Now the slight water has risen quite high. Wang Gong, the local leader, has already supervised the villagers to cut the reeds in the Jing River and clear the dam to facilitate water flow. Shao Hanyuan plans to build a Jiahe bank to increase the flow of the Jing River.</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a recent report from Linjiaba, the water level on the south bank of Weishan Lake is still rising. It has risen to one meter in the last two days. The Jingshan horizontal levee north of Linjiaba, due to the connection of the Yan River, has a narrower opening and insufficient flow for discharge. On the morning of the 11th, several zhang of the levee body collapsed. Tongshan County Magistrate Wang Gong immediately led 500 villagers from Linjiaba to rush to protect the Jingshan horizontal levee. At the same time, he ordered Liu Xinyuan, the head of the construction department, to supervise the villagers to rush to build Lanjiaba, with a deadline for completion. According to a phone call on the evening of the 11th, the water level in Weishan Lake has eased, and it is expected that the upper reaches of the Yellow River will also be stable. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water level of Weishan Lake continued to rise by ten centimeters, reaching 33.25 meters, and the situation is extremely critical. The dangerous period for the Central Canal has arrived. Yaowan rose six inches, Suqian rose eight inches, and Qingjiang rose two inches. The Construction Department sent another telegram to the Jiangbei Canal Flood Control Office on the 11th to step up precautions. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Baoding states that Xin Yin, the specialist sent by the Hebei Provincial Government to Changyuan to survey the disaster, reported to the provincial government that the Yellow River's water level rose sharply on the evening of the 9th.

In addition, Qi Shou'an, the director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province, saying that a telegram from Shaanxi reported that the water level in the upper reaches had suddenly increased and the flow was rapid. The water level was one meter and seven inches higher than the previous high. It is estimated that it will reach Changyuan at noon on the 10th and Batou at 8:00 PM.

(2) Zhang Diao will carry out the construction of the diversion river before the breach is closed after on-the-spot survey and determination of the route. (3) To convene regular meetings every Monday. The flow at the Dongzhuang breach is becoming more turbulent. The eastern remnants of the head continue to collapse, approaching the Quancheng people’s self-built dike by only twenty zhang, making the situation perilous. The River Bureau ordered the use of Qing material to rush to repair the wrapped embankment to resist the dike. The backflow in the southern section is very urgent and difficult to save. The River Bureau telegraphed the heads of counties Jun, Fan, Shou, Jun, and Yang to carry out rescue efforts on the one hand and to mobilize people within the area to build retreating embankments on the other. Currently, the river water has a tendency to cross the people's embankment and move eastward within the dike. If this happens, 10,000 hectares of farmland within the river area will inevitably be flooded. However, the water flow at the breach has decreased, making it easier to start closing the breach.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has authorized Customs to manage the entry and exit of vehicles at the border, and has formulated management regulations consisting of eight chapters and twelve articles. It stipulates that vehicles registered in foreign countries that enter China for sightseeing or travel must declare to the local customs or sub-customs or inspection office upon entry and have a lead-printed stamp affixed in a prominent position. Goods carried in, except those proven to belong to personal use, will be subject to import duties.

<h3>The Brewing of an Anglo-Japanese Conference</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>According to a report from the Dongbao, the British government has suggested to the Japanese government that an Anglo-Japanese conference be held this autumn to discuss various issues related to the Far East. The Japanese side is prepared to accept this suggestion and hopes that Sir Ross and the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will both be able to represent the United Kingdom at the conference. Although this news remains to be verified, it is not without cause. Furthermore, Sir Ross's current visit to China, according to the planned schedule, intends to stay in Japan for many days. To avoid attracting the attention of the Japanese people, he has canceled his trip to Washington. Therefore, we cannot help but suspect that the United Kingdom already has a tendency to compromise with Japan.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern question is inherently extremely complex. The United Kingdom has a significant influence within it. In recent years, the tension and relaxation of the Far Eastern situation have almost all been related to the United Kingdom's Far Eastern policy. During the visit of the British Lytton Commission to Manchuria last August and September, the idea of ​​reviving the Anglo-Japanese alliance was once rampant. Several foreign newspapers had widely rumored that the United Kingdom and Japan would reach a diplomatic compromise or conclude a treaty. The main goals were to establish a demilitarized zone south of the Philippines and to divide spheres of influence in Asia. The United Kingdom would be free to act in Central Asia, while Japan would be free to act in northern China. This news gradually subsided due to the deep economic conflicts of interest between the British Empire's autonomous dominions and colonies and Japan. The naval preparatory conference was also declared indefinitely adjourned due to the triangular antagonism. Japan then adopted a final measure, officially announcing the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. At this point, the Far Eastern question seemed to have entered an irreconcilable stage.</p>
<p>Since Japan announced the abandonment of the naval treaty, the United Kingdom's activities in the Far East have been noteworthy. However, in practice, the intention to seek a compromise has never been abandoned. Conservative British parliamentarians have been particularly vocal in advocating this. According to their claims, the United Kingdom should adhere to the principle of not offending Japan in dealing with the Far Eastern question, to avoid making the situation even worse. At the same time, it should play the role of mediator in an extremely friendly manner. On July 11, the new British Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered an important speech on foreign policy in the House of Commons. Regarding the Far Eastern question, he still did not forget the old friendship between the two countries, stating that strengthening Anglo-Japanese friendship was the cornerstone of his policy and hoped that the friendship between the United Kingdom and Japan would continue to develop without any obstacles in between. This kind of statement is a full expression of the conservative nature of British diplomacy.</p>
<p>Recently, the United Kingdom has automatically announced the cancellation of the naval ratio system. The United Kingdom seems to have once again respected Japan's advantage in East Asia. With such close opinions between the two sides, the possibility of compromise on the Far Eastern question will inevitably have considerable progress. However, what we should pay attention to is that the Far Eastern question is not only a question between the United Kingdom and Japan, but a question with the triangular relationship between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States as its main body. A compromise between the United Kingdom and Japan has the potential to provoke even deeper resentment from the United States. Although the United States' current Far Eastern policy takes neighborly relations as its surface, its central主張 is to complete its great naval plan as quickly as possible and to strive for the increase of economic benefits. This poses a serious threat to an Anglo-Japanese compromise.</p>
<p>With the increased possibility of compromise between the United Kingdom and Japan, the Far Eastern question may have new developments. Even if it has a considerable effect on East Asian peace, it will only be partial and temporary. However, the impact will intensify the competition for Far Eastern interests among other countries. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Little Appointed Commander of British Fleet in China, Having Served in Important Naval Positions, Scheduled to Take Office in China at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>(London) The British Emperor has approved the appointment of Vice Admiral Little as Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China from November 8 this year, to succeed Admiral Dreyer. Little will depart for China around December 6 and is expected to take office in January next year. Little was born in Shanghai on June 14, 1882. He studied at the Britannia Royal Naval College in England. When taking the examination for the rank of captain, he ranked first in all five subjects and was particularly skilled in piloting submarines. In 1916, he served as the captain of the cruiser "Dreadnought" and commander of the submarine flotilla. After that, he held important naval positions. In 1921, he was one of the British representatives at the Washington Naval Conference. In 1930, he was promoted to Rear Admiral. In 1932, he served as Secretary of the Admiralty and Chief of Naval Staff. The following year, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. (Reuter's dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Siamese Interior Minister to London, Rumors of Unrest in Bangkok are False</h3>

<h3>Italian Air Force Exercises in the Vicinity of Venice Port, Milan is the Hypothetical Target of Attack, Attack and Defense Performance is Satisfactory</h3>
<p>(Rome) Air force exercises were held on the 8th and 9th in the vicinity of Venice Port, Padua, and Milan. The exercise procedure was based on the assumption that Milan was the target of the attack. Several bomber squadrons departed from various air bases in the north, crossed the upper reaches of the Adige River, and attacked Milan during the day. On the other hand, two fighter squadrons were dispatched from Milan and Brescia to engage in defensive warfare. According to a government communiqué issued afterward, the exercise raised various questions about how to utilize the air force and tested them. In particular, there was much research on whether the use of new-style air defense equipment could protect Milan from enemy aircraft attacks. The aircraft participating in this exercise crossed many plateaus and mountains, so the average flight altitude was 5,000 meters. Moreover, the sky was cloudy, the wind was strong, and the weather conditions were extremely unfavorable. However, under these conditions, the performance of all five bomber squadrons participating in the exercise was satisfactory. It is reported that these five air force squadrons were recently organized by recruiting a large number of reserve officers to replace the air force transferred to East Africa.

<h3>Paris Three-Power Conference, List of British Delegation, To Resolve the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute, New Proposals Will Be Put Forward</h3>
<p>(London) The United Kingdom has sent an important delegation to the upcoming Three-Power Conference in Paris. In addition to Eden, the Senior Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Robert Craigie, will also participate. In addition, there are five or six senior officials from the European Affairs Department. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Robert Vansittart, will represent Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and Colonial Secretary Thomas at the negotiations. These people are all opposed to the League of Nations and advocate that the United Kingdom adopt a neutral attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian question, so their position is extremely important. Although Vansittart will not directly suppress Eden, he will inevitably take a compromise attitude towards French proposals. According to the Morning Post, the United Kingdom will put forward a proposal at the Three-Power Conference to satisfy all parties. The content of this proposal is kept extremely secret by the United Kingdom, but it is nothing more than a peaceful solution. It is expected that the United Kingdom will resume the land concession method to Italy. The Morning Post also said that after Italy occupies Abyssinia, the United Kingdom's interests in Egypt will be threatened. This argument is gaining momentum, believing that it is not impossible.

<h3>Italian People's Newspaper Explains Position on Abyssinia, Revealing Obvious Intentions for Expansion</h3>
<p>Milan: Today, the Italian People's Newspaper published an article that still provides practical criticism of the British attitude. However, the tone is not only calm and tactful but also purely theoretical in explaining Italy's position on the Abyssinian policy. The general idea is that Italy currently has an overpopulation and must have a place to vent. However, once Italy can obtain sufficient colonies, and these colonies have the potential for development, then Italy will not only adopt a conservative colonial policy itself but also follow the example of the United Kingdom to stop others. The United Kingdom's unfriendly attitude towards Italy fears that Italy may endanger British interests in Africa. However, the reason why Italy does not want to covet British colonies in Africa is that it can turn its attention to Abyssinia. (National Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia, Defensive Preparations Cannot Be Relaxed, Minister of War Denies Large-Scale Mobilization</h3>

<h3>In the Event of War in East Africa, the United Kingdom and Egypt Maintain Neutrality, The United Kingdom Will Increase Troops Stationed in Egypt</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Dispatch reported that the situation in East Africa is tense. In the event of war between Italy and Abyssinia, the borders of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Abyssinia should remain neutral. For this reason, the British government will send five infantry battalions to Egypt next month to increase the forces stationed on the border between Sudan and Abyssinia to ensure the neutrality of the area.

<h3>Portugal Does Not Relinquish One Inch of Philippine Territory, Some Suggest Dividing Concessions to Italy and Germany, Portuguese Ambassador to France Vigorously Denounces Their Recklessness</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Echo de Paris published a London dispatch yesterday, stating that regarding the plan to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, some people suggested dividing the Portuguese colonies in Africa to Italy and Germany. Italy would get Mozambique, Germany would get Angola, and Portugal would receive considerable compensation in terms of finance. The Portuguese Embassy in France has recently vehemently denied this news and stated the reasons as follows: "First, the Portuguese colonies are an integral part of the national territory and cannot be used as the object of any negotiations or financial bargaining. Second, Portugal's current financial situation can be called a model of this era, so it is absurd to use financial compensation that the country absolutely does not need to lure the country's territory. Third, Portugal's overseas possessions are the foundation of centuries of hard work, and their sovereignty has been determined, so there is no room for any doubts. It should be noted that the Portuguese government's administrative organization for managing colonies is in no way inferior to any country in the world. If anyone thinks that Portuguese land can be split to benefit any other country, it is truly a daydream. The Portuguese government and people will oppose this attempt to the end and do everything possible to protect the territorial integrity of the country." (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Author of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Kellogg Issues Statement, The Italian-Abyssinian Dispute Cannot Be Resolved by Force, Signatory Countries Have an Obligation to Abide by Their Promises</p>
<p>St. Paul, USA: Kellogg, the first Secretary of State and the author of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, issued a statement here today, saying, "The signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact have an obligation to remind other countries to abide by their promises, and this does not violate neutrality. Italy and Abyssinia cannot use any accident as an excuse to resolve their dispute through war. Although I do not advocate that any country use force to prevent conflict, I also advocate that all countries in the world work together to maintain the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In general, only the power of public will can prevent war." It is reported that Kellogg's statement is obviously related to the recent statement issued by the current Secretary of State Hull. Hull has asked Italy and Abyssinia to pay attention to their responsibilities for the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and some aspects criticize Hull for undermining the neutrality of the United States. Kellogg's opinion on this point is particularly noteworthy. (National Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Attack British Matter, British Protest Unanswered</p>

If he has not conveyed it, the United Kingdom will lodge a formal protest with Italy. (National Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>Italian Bank Raises Discount Rate, Demonstrating Determination to Oppose Inflation</p>
<p>(Rome) The Bank of Italy recently raised the discount rate and the interest rate on collateralized securities from 3.5% to 4.5%. According to the official explanation, the reason for this move is that it demonstrates the government's determination to oppose any inflation policy and will adhere to the financial policy since 1927. It is reported that the amount of currency in circulation last month has actually increased to 8,270,000,000 lire. The same month last year was only 4,420,000,000 lire, and the same month the year before was 3,010,000,000 lire. The general public believes that the increase in the amount of currency is due to the huge amount paid out by the Treasury. As for the amount of collateralized loans for securities last month, it decreased by 118,000,000 lire. The reason for this is that the recent development of industry and commerce has absorbed all the floating funds in the market, so they can no longer be used for collateralized loans for securities. Or the government recently raised the interest rate on Treasury bills to 5%, so the move to raise the discount rate and the interest rate on collateralized securities is actually to adapt to the above measures and make them coordinated.

<h3>Italy and France Jointly Draft, The Danube Convention Draft, Contains Four Principles, The Little Entente Plans to Meet at the End of the Month to Discuss</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Danube Convention has been jointly drafted by Italy and France. According to The Times, the content of the draft is based on the following three principles: (1) Mutual non-aggression; (2) Non-interference in internal affairs; (3) Agreement not to provide assistance to countries that engage in aggression without provocation. The newspaper also said, "Among the three principles, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is the most difficult to formulate in a concrete way. Although Germany can accept the prohibition of forcibly interfering in Austrian internal affairs, it will definitely try to make the principle of non-interference in internal affairs have a certain meaning, so that it can still carry out activities to undermine Austrian autonomy within Austria. This kind of strategy must be prevented in advance." (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The semi-official Vienna Post believes that the Danube Convention will take two forms: either concluding a substantial convention, in which case only a small number of countries will sign the convention, or reducing the content of the convention to a minimum, in which case the vast majority of countries can participate in the convention. The draft Danube Convention currently being considered by the countries concerned is generally focused on the second approach. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Pacific Aviation's Final Test Flight: The American Clipper Arrives in Honolulu</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Miles in Seventeen Hours; Trans-Pacific Airmail Service Possible Within the Year</p>
<p>Honolulu - The Clipper flying boat, which departed from Alameda, California, arrived safely here today, completing the first commercial flight between the U.S. mainland and Honolulu in record time.

The flying boat is currently refueling and will soon fly to Midway Island, 1,380 miles away, and then to Wake Island, 1,248 miles further. It is widely believed that this is the Clipper's final test flight in preparation for operating trans-Pacific air service between America and the Far East. The Pacific air route, totaling 8,500 miles, has already established bases at Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Manila. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Honolulu - U.S. Postmaster General Farley, who is vacationing here, personally witnessed the arrival and landing of the "Oriental Clipper" yesterday. This flight was a trial run to Midway and Johnston Islands, in preparation for establishing an air route between San Francisco and China. According to Farley, once President Roosevelt signs off on the funding approved by Congress for the service's commencement, commercial operators can be solicited. The service should be established within three months, allowing sixty days for solicitation and an additional thirty days for preparation. It is noted that this flight of the Oriental Clipper was the third test flight. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>US Silver Nationalization Reaches First Anniversary: Activity to Restore Silver Trading, Future Silver Prices Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>(New York) - Today marks the one-year anniversary of the U.S. government's nationalization of silver. Since the 24th, the price of silver has remained at 67 and ¾ cents per ounce. Meanwhile, silver merchants have suffered significant commission losses due to the government's heavy 50% tax on speculative profits, and governments of silver-using countries have encountered serious difficulties as a result of U.S. policy. According to reliable sources, there is currently behind-the-scenes activity to restore U.S. trading in forward silver, to prevent London and Montreal markets from gaining all the trading profits due to the tax. Many people in the U.S. are now accumulating forward silver in preparation for the resumption of trading. However, observers believe that the future of silver prices is difficult to predict. The Silver Purchase Act requires the Treasury to continue purchasing silver until the silver reserves in the national treasury reach a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver. To achieve this goal, the United States must purchase another 1 billion ounces. Therefore, silver advocates in Congress and speculators hope that if the government resumes large-scale purchases, the price of silver will rise to $1.29 per ounce. If the world silver price reaches this level, the U.S. government will no longer need to purchase silver, according to the Silver Purchase Act. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Control Automobile Manufacturing Industry: U.S. Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>(Washington) - Secretary of State Hull stated today that he had received reports indicating Japan plans to control all automobile manufacturing.

<h3>German Food Panic: Laboring Classes Increasingly Dissatisfied with Government's Economic and Social Policies</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - Various essential foodstuffs are in severe shortage throughout Germany, resulting in growing dissatisfaction among the laboring classes with the government's economic and social policies. In recent weeks, butchers have lacked fresh meat, and sausage factories have been unable to procure sufficient pork for sausage making. Fresh eggs are virtually impossible to find, and fruits are in poor condition due to shortages, with prices being very high and continuing to rise. The authorities have used force to suppress price increases, and butchers in many places have been arrested and detained for selling above the legal price limit. The current National Socialist Party authorities are concerned about the food panic. However, no matter what measures are taken, price increases continue unabated. As a result, the wage issue is bound to arise. Current wage levels are still based on the extremely low levels of 1932. Half of the country's workers earn less than 30 marks per week, while food prices have risen by an average of 25% over the past three years. According to official government statistics, the agricultural products index has risen from 61% to 100%. This situation is concerning, and it is no wonder that the people of the country are voicing disapproval. Furthermore, some members of the National Socialist Party have also expressed dissatisfaction with this situation and even criticize the government's rearmament policy. Economic Minister Schacht is unwavering in importing large quantities of metals and raw materials for manufacturing military supplies, while severely restricting imports of essential goods related to people's food supply. The current food panic is due to this. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Southern Trip</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua of This Newspaper</p>
<p>(I) Motivation for the Southern Trip</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic construction has made progress in various aspects. The provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, boasting the scenic beauty of the south, are also determined to develop and increase production. The achievements of the Guangxi militia training are widely praised, and their hard-working spirit is indeed admirable. At the beginning of the year, the reporter was once invited by the China National Aviation Corporation to fly to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, but due to bad weather, the plan was repeatedly postponed. Finally, due to fog in Wenzhou, the flight had to return, and the trip to the southwest was not realized. This time, six academic organizations, including the Science Society of China, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Chemical Society, the Geographical Society of China, the Zoological Society of China, and the Botanical Society of China, were invited by the Guangxi Provincial Government to hold a joint annual conference in Nanning starting on August 12th, to conduct academic research and visit the Guilin landscape, which is known as the best in the world. They also received a large-scale invitation from the local government, which is a pioneering move. The reporter is fortunate to be a part of this and is able to fulfill the desire to see for oneself what has been heard so many times. More than 300 members of the six organizations have signed up to attend the conference, and together with local members from Guangdong and Guangxi, the estimated number of attendees is around 400 or 500. The southern region is hot and humid, especially in August and September of the lunar calendar. Despite the sweltering heat and the need to carry a lot of luggage, the reporter prepared diligently and boarded the President Coolidge steamer of the Dollar Steamship Lines on July 30th from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Guangdong and Guangxi. The scheduled trip is for one month, with a journey of more than 5,000 miles. The impressions gained along the way are only superficial, but they are recorded in writing. The six organizations are purely academic research institutions, bringing together scholars from various places and absolutely not involved in political areas. Therefore, the reporter's records will also adhere to this principle.</p>
<p>(II) On Board the President Coolidge</p>
<p>The members' travel routes to the conference are divided into three types: A, from Shanghai · Hong Kong · Guangzhou · Sanshui · Wuzhou · Guixian · to Nanning; B, from Shanghai · Hong Kong · Wuzhou · Guixian · Nanning; C, from Hankou · Wuchang · Changsha · Yizhang · Lechang · Guangzhou · Sanshui · Wuzhou · Guixian · Nanning. Routes A and B are waterways, and Route C is by land. Those traveling by waterway mostly took the Hai Yuan of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which offered a 50% discount on fares. The cost of the first-class cabin was 70 yuan, but they only charged 35 yuan. The reporter prepared relatively late, and the cabins on the Hai Yuan were already fully booked, so he switched to the President Coolidge steamer of the Dollar Steamship Lines, which departed on the 30th. The fares on the Dollar Line and the China Shipping Company's steamers were the most expensive, with second-class cabins costing 97 yuan and first-class cabins costing 130 yuan. However, the sea voyage was two days shorter than that of the China Merchants, and it was felt that shortening the sea voyage was worthwhile in the extremely economical travel time. The President Coolidge and the President Hoover are sister ships and are the newest among the Dollar Line's fleet. They have a displacement of 25,000 tons, and their facilities are excellent. The waiters are all Cantonese and are very polite. Several members attending the conference, such as Feng Jiemin and Zhang Daohongcun, were on the same ship, making the journey less lonely. Most of the passengers in the first and second-class cabins were Americans, and women accounted for six or seven out of ten. American women are the most lively and strong, always wandering and playing on the deck. When they are sitting quietly, they are reading or writing. Their noble lifestyle is admirable. During the day, they mostly wear summer clothes in the style of swimsuits, revealing their curves. When they have dinner, they bathe and dress up in formal attire, looking elegant and luxurious, completely different from their daytime appearance. Men are always neatly dressed and always offer courtesies to women, which is indeed a concept that women's rights are higher than everything else. In the evening, there are dances and movies, which passengers find exciting. During the journey, the ship was affected by a hurricane, and there were some waves. The American women were still lively and active, but the number of Chinese men and women passengers in the dining room was reduced by half, which shows the difference in physical strength. There was an elderly American couple who said that the man was sixty-four years old and from California. They had purchased tickets for a round-the-world trip and it was their first time in the Far East, and they were very interested in the oriental customs. Such is their national character. Passengers on the ship are required to fill out a survey form, which includes a permanent address with a note that if any items are lost, they can be returned to that address. At the time, the reporter did not pay attention to it, but after arriving in Hong Kong, he hastily forgot his toiletries and soap. Before long, a ship's officer delivered them to the hotel. The strict management and thoughtful planning are worthy of reference for those in the travel business.</p>
<p>(III) Hong Kong: Intermittent Sunshine and Rain</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on August 1st, the ship arrived in Hong Kong and docked in Kowloon. The reporter had been here once twenty years ago, but now the place is completely different. The stores and rooms are small and crowded, but the room rates are surprisingly high. The climate in Hong Kong is generally cool, but when it is hot, it rains. After the rain, the sun shines, or it rains again shortly after. People are used to it, and residents carry rain gear when they go out, mostly hand-made large oil paper umbrellas. Even well-dressed Chinese and foreign men and women do so, which is a common sight and not surprising. Summer raincoats are hot and humid, so people avoid wearing them. On the day the reporter arrived in Hong Kong, it rained and shined as many as five times from 10:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Sometimes it was cloudy, and looking at the mountains in the distance, the thick fog obscured the scenery, making it impossible to distinguish the opposite bank. Before long, it would rain heavily. When the rain stopped, the rising sun revealed a mirage, with buildings appearing and disappearing, infinitely changing. Therefore, many buildings in Hong Kong have corridors on the sidewalks, similar to the buildings on the Avenue in the French Concession of Shanghai, for the convenience of the public. The rickshaws in Hong Kong are painted red, and the rickshaw pullers wear green hats. They are another kind of scenery. There are also bamboo sedan chairs, which are necessary for mountain roads and slopes. The minimum fare for a rickshaw is one Hong Kong dollar, and foreign tourists who travel by sedan chair mostly like to take sedan chairs to try them out. The porters walk slowly, allowing them to enjoy the scenery of the streets and markets. Rental cars are mostly 1935 models and are very sophisticated, equipped with meters. The minimum fare is 40 cents, and then it increases according to the distance. Short trips are the cheapest. Six or seven out of ten residents can speak fluent English, but in general, apart from Cantonese, they do not understand a single word of Mandarin. In addition to using English, the reporter had to communicate with the hotel staff by writing questions and answers. Traveling while mute also has its own kind of fun. The lack of unified language and currency is indeed an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
<p>(IV) The Contradiction between Prices and Living Expenses</p>
<p>Hong Kong's commercial and special political status is roughly equivalent to Shanghai in the central region and Tianjin in the north. Guangzhou, the political center of the southwest, is like Shanghai in the south and Peiping in the north. Therefore, Hong Kong is home to many politicians, old loyalists, wealthy merchants, and overseas Chinese, which has gradually increased the level of living expenses. Recently, the value of the Hong Kong dollar has been rising, with 100 Shanghai dollars worth about 70 Hong Kong dollars. At the same time, the cost of living has also risen accordingly. The reporter stayed for two days and felt that Hong Kong is indeed the most expensive place to live in the Far East. For example, the minimum fare for a rickshaw is one Hong Kong dollar, which is equivalent to two Shanghai cents. A car costs three Hong Kong dollars per hour, which is equivalent to 4.2 Shanghai dollars. The room rate for a medium-sized room in a mid-to-upper-class hotel is about 4-5 Hong Kong dollars, which is equivalent to 6-7 Shanghai dollars. Add in meal expenses and other expenses, and it costs more than 10 Shanghai dollars per day. Therefore, members of the laboring class toil all day long but cannot afford to eat their fill. But while living expenses are so high, commodity prices are particularly low, which is a very contradictory phenomenon. Hong Kong is a tax-free port, and the prices of goods shipped to Hong Kong from various countries are much lower than in Shanghai, sometimes even half the price. It would seem that the stores should be crowded with customers, but in fact, they are constantly reducing prices, but there are very few customers. The purchasing power of the people is fundamentally weak, and they all adhere to the principle of saving where possible. Therefore, unless rent, rice, and vegetables are reduced, the low price of other ordinary goods has no impact on the high cost of living. There are the most small exchange shops in Hong Kong, with signs saying "Gold and Silver Exchange," specializing in exchanging different currencies from various places. The next most common are pharmacies and grocery stores run by Indians, which tout themselves as selling the cheapest goods. Silk shirts are only sold for six Hong Kong dollars, and ties are as cheap as one or two cents. Eight or nine out of ten of them are Japanese goods, and their business is booming. Other stores that used to sell British and American goods have failed due to high prices. At first, they struggled to support themselves, but recently, they have also started importing Japanese goods. Therefore, Japanese goods flood the port of Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Guangzhou Burns Down Twenty-Two Shops and Residences: More Than 100,000 Yuan in Losses and Hundreds of Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the opening of roads in Guangzhou, the number of fires has been decreasing. However, the inner streets that have not been developed are still prone to fires. At about 4:00 AM on the 7th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out on Zheng Street, 16th Section, Xiguan, in the city. The shop where the fire started was the "Xiongchu" weaving shop, located at number 6 on the street. The shop has been open for several years and has been doing ordinary business. This time, they were not careful with fire, and the neighbors have many comments. After the fire broke out, the wind fanned the flames, and the blaze soared into the sky. Before long, various fire brigades gathered to extinguish the fire. It was finally extinguished at about 5:00 AM. However, in an instant, more than twenty residences and shops had been reduced to ashes, leaving more than a hundred refugees homeless. The situation was miserable. After investigation, the shops that were burned down included the Shanghai Shoe Store at number 1 on Zheng Street, 16th Section, the Wanfang Shoe Factory at number 1-1, the World Shoe Store at number 2, the Global Shoe Store at number 3, the Wanxing Shoe Store at number 4, a vacant shop at number 5, the Xiongchu Weaving Factory (where the fire started) at number 6, the Yong'an Shoe Store at number 7, the Xiufang Shoe Store at number 8, the Yong'an Shoe Store at number 9, the Mei and Shoe Store at number 10, the Bin'anhe Tin Shop at number 11, the Cuigutang Bookstore at number 12, the Saixiu Shoe Store at number 13, a vacant shop at number 14, the Sanyuan Soap Factory at number 15, the Minxing Shoe Store at number 16, the Sanyuan Machine Room at number 17, the Huazhen Tin Shop at number 18, and the Tan residence at number 1 in East Lane 1, 16th Section. All of these were completely destroyed. Those that were half-burned included the Chen residence at number 2 in East Lane 1, 16th Section, and the Li residence at number 2 in West Lane 1, 16th Section. A total of twenty shops and residences were completely burned down, and two were half-burned, with a total loss of more than 100,000 yuan. When the Chen residence at number 2 in East Lane 1 was burning, an old woman, Chen He, was unable to escape and was suffocated by the smoke. A thirteen-year-old girl, Chen Dongxi, also fainted. Fortunately, the rescue team arrived and rescued them, sending them to the hospital for treatment. Their lives are not in danger. (August 8th)</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Flood in Quanzhou Prefecture: Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Anxi Counties are the Most Severely Affected; Tong'an, Hui'an, Zhangzhou, and Putian are Less Affected</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The flood in the five counties of Quanzhou Prefecture this time is unprecedented in centuries. Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Anxi counties are the most severely affected, followed by Tong'an and Hui'an. The impact has extended north to Putian and Shantou, and south to Zhangzhou, all suffering from the disaster. Now, the disaster situation in various places is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>In Jinjiang, within Quanzhou City and its suburbs, more than 1,400 houses collapsed. After the water receded, on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, more than 50 houses continued to collapse. As for the four rural districts of Jinjiang, the areas outside the West and North Gates of the first district are the most severely affected. Among them, the towns of Fuqiao and Xinnan have affected areas including: Sanliantan, Huangjia Street, Fuqiao, Wujing, Shiqi, Gaoshan, Liutou, Jingwei, Chidian, Weicuo, Zhangqi, Caizhou, Jinshan, and Shaweixia. On that day, in Fuqiao town, only one corner of Gaoshan village and a dozen households around Xinhua School on a small hill in Fuqiao were not affected. The rest of the villages were a vast expanse of water, with depths ranging from 5 feet at the shallowest to 5 or 6 feet at the deepest. Of the more than 10,000 people in the two towns, approximately 1,800 to 1,900 out of 2,200 households were flooded. Villagers climbed onto rooftops to escape the water, huddling there for two days and nights. Currently, 600 to 700 houses have collapsed in the towns, affecting over 2,000 people. In the villages of the northwest town: Tian'an, Houchucuo, Kangmei, Taqian, Tahou, Duanhu, Baishuiying, Majiapu, Tanmei, Zhongbao, Wubao, Meita, Qixia, Puming, Fengling, outside the city, Huayuantou, Dingxia, the villages of Tanmei, etc., hundreds of houses have collapsed, with an estimated loss of property worth approximately 200,000 yuan. In total, the disaster in Jinjiang, in addition to the collapse of more than 1,500 houses in Quanzhou City and the death of approximately 200 people, the corpses floating everywhere in the villages are still difficult to count. The northwest parts of Jinjiang, along the east and west streams, mostly consist of rice fields. This time, the disaster is particularly severe. It is estimated that in the first district of the northwest, with a population of 220,000, approximately 30,000 out of 40,000 households are farmers. Houses have collapsed, furniture and farm tools have been washed away, and the rice crops in the fields have been completely destroyed. Stored grain and livestock have been lost to the water. It is estimated that the loss of rice crops in the first district of the northwest this season will reach 90,000 shi (a unit of dry volume), and at least 10,000 out of 30,000 farming households need relief.</p>
<p>Nan'an is located upstream of Jinjiang, along the east and west streams. The disaster area is wider, covering almost the entire county. The losses in the rural areas are even more severe than in Jinjiang. Along the 70-mile stretch of the east and west streams, 60 to 70 villages in the Yun'er district of Dongxi Wharf have been affected, with countless houses collapsing. More than 160 houses have collapsed in Honglai Street, with Western-style buildings accounting for a quarter of them. Nearby, in Furong village, more than 100 houses have collapsed. The villages of Xiasuyuan and those near the stream have been completely submerged, with water depths of more than 1 zhang (a unit of length) in low-lying areas, and dozens of houses collapsing. The losses in Shi'an and other places are also significant. Baiye village, located at the confluence of the east and west streams, has been flooded, with 80 to 90 percent of shops and residences collapsing, almost turning into ruins. In Xingpu village, the water has reached 1 zhang, with more than 30 houses collapsing and more than 10 people crushed to death. In the west stream, such as the Da'ao village in the northern section of Xiwei district, the water depth in low-lying areas has reached more than 1 zhang, with rapid currents and more than 60 houses collapsing in the entire village. In the villages of Dunding, Lunhou, and Kucang, near the stream, the floodwaters have invaded, collapsing more than 100 houses, leaving more than 2,000 people homeless. The loss of agricultural produce is still difficult to estimate. The newly built mansion of the militia leader Chen Peiyu has completely collapsed. Only one bell tower of the Liantang School and more than 100 houses in Liantang village remain safe. More than half of the Western-style buildings and shops in Meilin New Street have collapsed, totaling more than 40. Dozens of houses have collapsed in Xiwei Street, mostly Western-style buildings. According to later reports, more than 10 people have died in Yantou and other villages. The victims along the east and west streams are all sleeping in the mountains. The villages of Xikou, Huangsuan, Linxiawei, and Dongpu are all vast expanses of water. Hundreds of residential houses have collapsed in the county seat. Most of the newly built Suilou of the county government has collapsed. Outside the city, it is a vast expanse of water, with some houses completely submerged and some half-submerged. People are climbing onto the roofs, crying for help. The county party headquarters is located on high ground, and hundreds of refugees have taken shelter there. Although the floodwaters did not reach the performing garden in Shikou village, as well as Yun'nei, Kelin, and Ban, more than 30 houses have collapsed due to wind and rain. In the Jintao district, many houses have collapsed in the villages of Duoqiao, Hounao, Caokun, Xiawei, Liucuo, and Houcuo due to flooding. Quanzhou Prefecture is close to the sea, so although the flooding is severe, Jinjiang is on the coast. After the typhoon subsides, the floodwaters should easily drain into the sea as the tide recedes. Therefore, the water in Jinjiang receded in one day. Nan'an, located upstream, also began to recede on the same day as Jinjiang and completely receded in three days. After the water receded, the county government investigated the villages near the four gates (east, south, west, and north) outside the county seat and found that up to 500 houses had collapsed. The road surfaces of Quande Motor Road Panshan, Xin'an Bridge, and the three sections of the Jinjiang West Gate have been almost completely destroyed and cannot be repaired in the short term. In the Guoxi Shitou village, the water level reached 5 zhang at its highest point. A camphor tree that was several hundred years old, requiring eight people to hold hands to encircle it, was submerged even at the treetops, and was uprooted and washed away, showing the severity of the flood. More than 2,000 houses have collapsed in the entire Nan'an county, and the loss of farmland has affected almost the entire county. There is currently no accurate estimate.</p>
<p>Anxi is the source of the east and west streams in Quanzhou Prefecture. This flood is the most severe in the basins of the east and west streams. Therefore, the disaster in Anxi is also extremely tragic. On the 30th, the wind and rain did not stop, and the streams surged. In the evening, water entered the east and west gates. The magnitude of the water was unprecedented in the records. Along the banks of the streams for more than 50 li (a unit of distance), more than 100 villages were submerged. The water depth in low-lying areas reached more than 1 zhang. On the 1st, the water began to recede. On the 3rd, it completely receded. When the floodwaters landed, the currents were rapid. Three-fifths of the county seat was submerged. Residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, moved to higher ground to take refuge. County magistrate Jiang Xian, because part of the county government also collapsed, led his staff to move to higher ground to take refuge. More than 1,000 houses collapsed in the urban area. Along the stream, from Huangkou, Fokou, Peng'an, Xidou, Wupu, Xianyuan, Guangde, Tangwei, and more than 200 villages, 2,000 houses were destroyed. Among them, approximately 1,000 houses collapsed in the first district, especially in the more than 20 villages of Yutian, Cannei, Houan, Huangtan, Chenbanyang, Xianyuan, Wupu, and Shangchang, which were the most severely affected. Farmers in the affected areas lost all their furniture, farm tools, livestock, and grains. Farmland was submerged, and rice crops were destroyed. Victims took refuge on rooftops or in the mountains, with some going without food for two or three days. The number of deaths is not yet certain. It is known that there are more than 100 deaths near the city. It is estimated that the number of victims in the entire county will reach 50,000 to 60,000 people. The Tongxi highway has been destroyed, and there is no prospect of repair. Transportation has come to a standstill. This is the general situation of the disaster in Anxi.</p>
<p>On the 30th, a flash flood occurred in Tong'an. Water entered Tong'an City, reaching a depth of 1 zhang in low-lying areas and 5 or 6 feet in high-lying areas. More than 40 houses collapsed, killing 5 people and drowning more than 10 people. The highways to Quanzhou through Tongxi and to Zhangzhou through Maxiang and Guankou were all destroyed. The eastern district in the rural areas was more severely affected. Villages were flooded, and more than 100 houses collapsed. In total, 22 villages were affected, leaving more than 3,000 people homeless. The total loss of homes, houses, fields and crops in the eastern district was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hui'an City and its surrounding areas suffered from the wind and rain, with dozens of houses collapsing. Because there are no major rivers, there were no floods. However, the maritime losses were extremely severe. It is estimated that more than 140 fishing boats and sand barges were destroyed by the typhoon along the coast of northern Hui'an. More than 100 boats were washed away along the coast of eastern and southern Hui'an. Many fruit trees and power poles were blown down, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>On July 30th and 31st, the streams rose in Yongchun. Water entered Yongchun County, reaching a depth of 1 foot in the Nanma Road area. The Dapu and Penghu areas were also flooded, but only to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The water receded on August 1st. Dozens of houses collapsed in the urban and rural areas. The losses were relatively light.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the water rose in Zhangzhou. The Xinqiao and Maping Street areas were flooded. The road surfaces of the Zhangsong and Zhangfu roads were damaged. Traffic was suspended starting on the 30th. Although the water in the urban area was not very deep, it did not completely recede until the 4th. Traffic on the Zhanggao and Zhangfu roads resumed on the 7th. The rural areas of Longxi and Haicheng, near the Jiulong River and Zhang River, were flooded. However, Zhangzhou's water conservancy facilities are very good, with ditches and canals crisscrossing the area. The area is mostly rice fields, so although it is easily flooded, it is also easily drained. Furthermore, Zhangzhou has a rainy season every year, and people are accustomed to the water and are well-prepared. This time, it was not the center of the typhoon, so only a few houses collapsed in the city and surrounding areas. The water in the rural areas receded quickly, and there was no major loss of rice crops. However, the Zhangsong, Zhangfu, and Zhanglong roads suffered significant damage. The third typhoon landed in Xiamen. In the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou area, there was heavy rain on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. In the afternoon of the 7th, the streams in the east and west of Quanzhou rose again, and the floodwaters returned in the evening. The Shuimen, Xinmen, Sanbao, Wubao, and Ximen areas were flooded by more than 2 feet. In the morning of the 8th, villages such as Caigongzhou in the suburbs were submerged, reaching a depth of more than 1 zhang. The water in Shuimen Lane also submerged a section of Zhongyou Road and South Main Street. The flooded areas in the rural areas stretched for dozens of li along the east and west streams. In Zhangzhou, in the afternoon of the 8th, the water in the Jiulong River and Zhang River rose again. The water in the Zhang River was level with the bank, and the water in the Jiulong River near Xiangshui Bridge was level with the road. At 4 p.m., the Zhangsong Road was closed. Both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou are in fear of a third flood. Fortunately, the weather cleared in the morning of the 9th. Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Anxi counties are currently busy with relief efforts, all relying on donations, but there are no designated funds. (August 9th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Implements Strict Anti-Smoking Measures: All Opium Dens Must Close</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Wuhu Public Security Bureau is strictly implementing the promulgated anti-smoking regulations. By the end of September, all opium smokers in the city will be ordered to register in order to gradually reduce their numbers and realize the plan to eradicate opium by 1940. The publicity campaign has been ongoing for a week since the beginning of this month. As the deadline of the end of September is approaching, the bureau has strictly ordered its subordinates to intensify their work. On the 10th, it convened a meeting of the heads of various departments and branches to discuss the matter in detail and decided on the following key points: "(1) Anti-smoking publicity and registration should be carried out simultaneously. The registration work should not be stopped due to the publicity campaign. (2) Opium smokers who voluntarily register should be exempted from punishment. Those who are found out by investigation, informants, or whistleblowers, in addition to being ordered to obtain a license, will be punished according to the regulations. (3) Each branch should immediately carry out investigations and report them at any time for punishment. (4) The anti-smoking publicity campaign will end this Saturday. The publicity team should comply with this order. (5) Even those who have opium licenses are not allowed to gather in groups of three or more to smoke opium." Each branch and the anti-smoking section, with strict orders and no delay allowed, have dispatched a large number of police officers to various places to conduct inspections in recent days. Currently, 30 to 40 opium smokers without licenses have been captured in the Zhongshan Road Second Street area and have been taken to the bureau for detention pending interrogation. As for opium licenses for the poor, a document has been prepared and submitted to the provincial government requesting the issuance of 2,000 licenses, which will be sent to Wuhu within days for use by the poor who have been certified by the Baotjia heads. The bureau also believes that most of the captured opium smokers cannot afford to obtain licenses. It intends to send these people to the drug rehabilitation center for compulsory rehabilitation and to expand the existing drug rehabilitation center, moving it from the Da Zhonghua Hospital to the Jixiang Temple for office. The inspector general Wang Shuxin has been appointed as the director of the center. All opium smokers who cannot afford to obtain licenses must be ordered to enter the center for rehabilitation so that the number of opium smokers in the city can be gradually reduced. According to the regulations for compulsory registration of opium smokers, opium dens cannot exist, and it is impossible for three or more people to gather in one place to smoke opium. Currently, the 200 to 300 opium dens in the city have all closed down. The anti-smoking work in Wuhu has been the most intense and strict this time. It seems that the people on the "black list" have already reached the end of the road. (11th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Graduation Ceremony for Baotjia Heads Trained This County Government, following the order to hold Baotjia head training and three weeks of course, was completed by the county governor who conducted tests, and the result was very good. This county has 815 Baotjia heads, excluding the village heads who are also the Baotjia heads, those exempted. 43 people were sick, and 582 people attended. All were on time, and all the boarders lived in Yangjiaqiao Primary School, Qixian Girls' School and Guanyinqiao Primary School and other places by the head of each district as instructor, and one additional instructor to recruit materials. Each Baotjia head paid attention to the application of the Baotjia system. Those who did not pass the test were only 42 people. At 7:00 am today, the graduation ceremony will be held in the Songjiang Grand Theater, and diplomas will be awarded. Inspector Sun Yunxia, ​​specially dispatched by the Department of Civil Affairs, will give a speech. After the ceremony, County Governor Jin led the team to the New Songjiang Sheguang Square for a photo shoot. In the afternoon, each Baotjia head carried his luggage and returned to his village.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Journalists from Various Counties in Jiangsu Province Stage a Joint Petition This Morning</p>
<p>The journalists' association of this city, for the purpose of appealing to revise the publication law and requesting an interpretation of the crime of defamation in the criminal law, specifically initiated the joint action of the press from the various counties of Jiangsu and set today (the 12th) for petitioning in Beijing. Yesterday, representatives from the various counties came to Wuxi and gathered at the Railway Hotel, including Bao Mingshu from the Zhenjiang Xin Jiangsu Newspaper, Zhang Yishan from the Ziqiang Daily, Yang Hanmei from the Lianhe News Agency, Hu Juemin from the Suzhou Wuxian Daily, Yan Yisheng from the Zaobao, Xi Xiaoxuan from the Jiangyin Zhengqi Newspaper, Cao Yichen from the Dasheng Newspaper, Chen Kehua from the Wujin Commerce Newspaper, Xia Hezhe from the Yebao, Tu Zhifang from the Chenbao, the Xin Liyang Newspaper, Fang Zhiyuan from the Yixing Pin Newspaper, Wu Guanzhu, Sun Dexian from the Wuxi Journalists' Association, Sun Xiangfeng from the Bao, Hua Jinji, Zhou Zhenhua from the Changshu Dajiang Yebao, and Kong Xiangzhen from the Qinbao and the Xinsheng Newspaper, totaling over 20 people. At 3:00 p.m., the journalists' association of this city held a tea party in the New World Western Restaurant to entertain representatives from the various counties and exchange ideas on the petition. Sun Dexian chaired the meeting, and Hua Jinji recorded the minutes. The following matters were resolved: (1) The delegation was named the "Jiangsu Province Press Petition to Amend the Publication Law Delegation." (2) Jinji was designated as treasurer and Yang Hanmei as general affairs. (3) At 8 p.m. that evening, they would gather at the Railway Hotel and take a train to Beijing. (4) They would gather at the Central Hotel in Nanjing to entertain the capital's press and encourage them to carry out the petition. (5) Bao Mingshu, Wu Guanzhu, Sun Dexian, and Hu Juemin were appointed as secretaries of the delegation. (6) They would jointly initiate the organization of a Jiangsu Province Press Association, with Bao Mingshu and Sun Xiangfeng tasked with researching the name. (7) The delegation would telegraph the whole country to unanimously advocate for judicial relief regarding the defamation portion of the criminal law. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed. That evening, representatives from the Press Association, Xibao Xishan News Agency, Guominding Newspaper, Renbao, Education News Agency, New Wuxi, and Xinmin Newspaper hosted a banquet for the representatives from the various counties at the Yingbin Building. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves. It is reported that a total of 25 counties, eight press associations, and 46 newspapers participated in the petition. There were 20 people from 15 counties departing from Wuxi, and the rest would gather in Nanjing to jointly carry out the petition. At the same time, they jointly submitted a continuing petition to the central government and ministries, requesting assistance.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Pawnshops are Prohibited from Selling Packages and Collecting Commissions The Wuyi Pawnbrokers Association, in response to the advertisement published by Attorney Zhang Zhiguo on behalf of Zhang Xueyan, which stated that there was a certificate from Fengji's appraisal clothing store and ordered all pawnshops in the county to sell packages and collect commissions, immediately convened a meeting of all colleagues to discuss the matter. They unanimously denied it and argued reasonably. Yesterday (the 10th), they telegraphed the provincial government and the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction to strictly prohibit it. The original text stated that the sale of unredeemed goods by pawnshops has been carried out independently for decades, from the Qianqing Dynasty to the present, and there is no such thing as consignment sales. Our industry is already in a state of disrepair, and we can hardly maintain it. How can we bear further burdens and be exploited again? Based on the average capital of 10,000 yuan for each of the 16 pawnshops in the county, totaling 320,000 yuan, the minimum commission of 1% would require 3,200 yuan per year. The loss of selling packages has been appealed for assistance. If commissions are charged again, it is tantamount to adding insult to injury. The situation of each pawnshop is urgent and fearful. It is difficult to maintain business without strictly prohibiting such illegal interference and arbitrary destruction.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Using the Baotjia System to Recruit Labor for Dike Defense</p>
<p>County Magistrate Ma, because the water level of the canal is gradually rising, and Jiangdu is located at the juncture of the canal, bordering the river and lake, the situation is precarious, so he ordered the seventh district head to actively handle the recruitment of labor and the collection of earth for dike defense from Shaobo Liuzha to Gaoyou Da'erjin area. He convened a meeting of the relevant township heads and decided to use the Baotjia method, requiring all able-bodied men in the township area to go to work. Work began on the 9th. The townships and towns within 20 miles of the canal dike in the fourth district will also recruit labor and collect earth immediately. The townships and towns not within 2 miles were ordered to organize consolation teams and raise money for medicines and other supplies to send to the work area for consolation.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Ferry Accident on the Jiangjing Ferry</p>
<p>The Highway Administration of the Provincial Department of Construction has been operating a ferry at Huangtiangang for ten days. On the 9th, when the typhoon passed, the river was turbulent. At 9:00 a.m., the Jiangjing ferry, traveling south from the north, was about to enter the port when it suddenly collided with a lighter carrying 180 dan (a unit of weight) of distiller's grains, loaded by Cha and Zhuding Mountain, and sank it. The men and women on the boat were rescued, and Wang Sanlin, a crew member, was cut in the leg. Later, he approached the ferry bureau to negotiate, but there was no result. He reported to the 16th Water Police Team for assistance.</p>

He will enter Beijing within days to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country to discuss the date of presenting his credentials. The details of his arrival in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Party</p>
<p>The "Tjinegara" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th, but due to encountering a storm en route, it only entered the port at 6:50 am yesterday morning and docked at the Qichang Pier in Pudong at 8:00 am. Local Chinese and foreign people chartered a special boat, the "Mona," from the New Customs Pier at around 8:00 am and sailed to Pudong to welcome the Minister. The welcoming party included Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Tang Shixuan, Secretary of the Municipal Government; Herman Heringa, Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai; Vice-Consul Wang Dun; Secretary Jaepma; Stock, President of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce; Speelman, General Manager of the International Savings Society; and Dutch business leaders Klée, Völling, Van Leeuwen Boomkamp, and Van Someren Rombout, and others, numbering dozens.</p>
<p>Arrival Details</p>
<p>Mr. Nieuwenhuis departed from the Netherlands in early June to come to China. On the way, he learned that the Chairman of our National Government had gone to Lushan to escape the summer heat, so he went ashore and stayed temporarily in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it was not until yesterday morning that he arrived in Shanghai by boat. When the welcomers boarded the boat, Mr. Nieuwenhuis shook hands with each of them and expressed his thanks. Then, a tea party was held in the reception room of the boat. At 10:45 am, he took the reception boat to the New Customs Pier and disembarked, returning to his official residence to rest.</p>
<p>Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Nieuwenhuis gave a brief statement to the reporters on the boat, saying, "I am very honored to be appointed to China. I will work hard to promote the friendship between China and the Netherlands in the future. I have just arrived in Shanghai, and it is still difficult to determine my itinerary completely. However, I will first go to Beijing within days to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your country to discuss the date of presenting my credentials, and then return to Shanghai to stay temporarily. I will go to Beijing before the date of presenting my credentials to meet with Chairman Lin, and then go to Peiping. As for the rumored anti-Chinese incident in the Dutch East Indies, the reporter asked about this, and Minister Nieuwenhuis denied it."</p>
<p>Minister Nieuwenhuis' Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Nieuwenhuis is about 40 years old and full of energy. His wife is younger. Mr. Nieuwenhuis is a Doctor of Law. He entered the diplomatic service in 1917 and has served in embassies in Colombia, Washington, Turkey, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and Peiping. This time, he was promoted from Counselor of the Berlin Embassy to Minister to China. Mr. Nieuwenhuis served in the Peiping Embassy from 1927 to 1931, so he has a clear understanding of the situation in our country. The friendship between the two countries will be even closer.</p>
<h3>Chinese Overseas Association: Received a Police Warning from the Dutch East Indies Yesterday: Overseas Chinese and Natives Engage in Fighting</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Chinese Overseas Association in Shanghai suddenly received an urgent telegram from Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies yesterday, reporting an extremely unfortunate incident: Overseas Chinese and local natives recently engaged in group fighting. This unfortunate event has spread from Padang to Sibolga and then to Siantar, shocking the entire Dutch East Indies. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Huang Jianzhong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Overseas Association, yesterday, who gave the following account of the situation:</p>
<p>The Cause of the Group Fighting Was Extremely Minor</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the Shanghai Chinese Overseas Association received a telegram this morning from Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies that this unfortunate incident occurred in Padang in eastern Sumatra. The cause of the incident was extremely minor. The local Padang held a football match between the Chinese and the natives. Both sides organized cheering squads to cheer on the teams. Unexpectedly, the cheering and shouting of the cheering squads led to a dispute and eventually turned into violence, and finally each side engaged in group fighting.</p>
<p>Emotions Were Inflamed, and Two Other Places Continued the Fighting</p>
<p>After this incident occurred in Padang, the news spread to Sibolga, and both the overseas Chinese and the natives were resentful, and conflicts continued. Therefore, the second group fighting between the Chinese and the natives in Sibolga also resulted in violence. After Sibolga, the natives and overseas Chinese in Siantar also received the news and engaged in a third group fighting. According to the tone of this morning's telegram, as of today (the 11th), the fighting in the above three places has not yet stopped, and other ports are also on the verge of action.</p>
<p>The Entire Dutch East Indies Is in Terror</p>
<p>Therefore, the entire Dutch East Indies is currently in an atmosphere of terror and chaos. The telegram did not provide detailed records of the number of deaths and injuries on both sides, but the tragedy of the fighting and the number of deaths can be imagined. There will be further telegrams to determine how to resolve this unfortunate incident. Since Shanghai has this news, it is likely that Nanjing also has a telegram.</p>
<p>The Authorities Mobilized to Suppress and Stop the Fighting</p>
<p>The authorities in the Dutch East Indies, seeing that the spread from Padang to Sibolga and then to Siantar was so rapid, were deeply concerned that it would expand further, and the future would be uncontrollable. They have now begun to use extremely strict police power to send out all police personnel to suppress and stop the fighting. At the same time, the Dutch government, after hearing the news, urgently sent a telegram to the Dutch East Indies authorities to take effective measures to stop the fighting. At the same time, they also asked the Chinese Kapitan (the title of Chinese official) and our consul to come forward quickly with effective methods to quell the matter, so that the situation would not expand further.</p>
<h3>The China Agricultural Loan Syndicate Decides on Autumn Loans, Focusing on Cotton and Rice, Totaling 3 Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Decides to Add Overseas Chinese Village; Currently in Negotiations with Jiangxi and Fujian Provincial Authorities</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, many overseas Chinese have been forced to return to China due to the impact of the global economic downturn. To properly plan relief measures, the central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously planned to establish "Overseas Chinese Villages" in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces to settle unemployed and destitute returned overseas Chinese. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the local Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to the person in charge, the planned Overseas Chinese Villages in Jiangxi and Fujian by the central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have been delayed due to limited funding. Currently, many returned overseas Chinese are registering for relief, but the quota for the Overseas Chinese Village in Xuancheng, Anhui, is full, making it impossible to accommodate them. The central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has decided to proceed with negotiations with the Jiangxi and Fujian provincial authorities to purchase barren land and prepare for cultivation. However, the realization of this plan will still take time.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Japanese pilot Mr. Ano arrived in Shanghai in the Qinghai aircraft, but has been delayed for over a week due to weather conditions.

<h3>Four Silk Factories in the Zhabei District Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Four More Factories to Resume Work This Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, eighteen silk factories in the Zhabei and Xinza districts of this city experienced a labor strike due to wage disputes. After officials from the Party and government were dispatched to mediate, the ten silk factories in the Zhabei district had already resumed work. However, the workers in the Xinza district silk factories were still hesitant. The Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau believed that at a time when the silk industry was showing signs of recovery, labor and management should sincerely cooperate and strive for development. Therefore, they jointly issued a notice the day before yesterday, advising all workers to resume work yesterday morning and dispatched Lu Yinchu and Zhu Guilin to protect the workers in conjunction with the police from the relevant public security bureau. The silk factories complied with the order and started operations at 5 AM yesterday. Workers from four factories, including Yuan Ji Jiuji on Guangfu Road and Yuan Ji Fuchang on Chang'an Road, returned to work. However, only a few workers from four factories, including Jiyu Meifeng on Gonghe Road, Yuanxing on Meiyuan Road, and Xingchang on Yutong Road, entered the factories, resulting in a failure to start operations. It is expected that all workers will resume work this morning.</p>

<h3>Through-Service Less-Than-Carload Freight Trains Between Shanghai and Beiping Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>At the end of last year, the Jinghu-Huhangyong Railway Administration, under the order of the Ministry of Railways, issued regulations for through-service less-than-carload freight trains and ordered the establishment of through-service less-than-carload freight trains between Shanghai and Beiping and between Shanghai and Xi'an. During the Ninth National Transportation Conference, representatives from the Jinpu and Beining Railways were consulted to establish regulations for through-service less-than-carload freight trains between Shanghai and Beiping, effective August 11. The details are as follows: Article 1: The operation of through-service less-than-carload freight trains and the attached train numbers are as shown in the attached table (table omitted). Article 2: Each through-service less-than-carload freight train is tentatively scheduled to have eight 40-ton covered wagons, totaling 16 wagons, as shown in the attached table (table omitted). Based on the distance traveled, the Jinghu Railway will provide four wagons, the Jinpu Railway will provide ten wagons, and the Beining Railway will provide two wagons. Rental fees for these wagons will not be calculated, nor will they be included in the interline accounting. However, they must be registered separately on a daily basis for verification. Article 3: Each train should be assigned one escort. Wagons from a certain railway should be escorted by an escort from that railway. The days off for the escorts will be determined by each railway. Article 4: The escorts should be under the command of the stationmasters along the route. Article 5: Through-service less-than-carload freight trains should only carry through-service less-than-carload freight. However, the railway's own less-than-carload freight, as well as intermodal freight between the Jinghu-Huhangyong and Zhegan Railways and the Jinpu Railway south of Xuzhou, and between the Jinghu-Huhangyong-Zhegan Railways south of Pei County and Xuzhou and the Longhai Railway, can only be loaded if there is space available in the wagons. Article 6: The escort's report should be completed in quadruplicate, one copy for the record and three copies to be submitted to the stationmaster in Shanghai or Beiping (for less-than-carload freight trains from Shanghai to Beiping, submit to the stationmaster in Beiping; for less-than-carload freight trains from Beiping to Shanghai, submit to the stationmaster in Shanghai), and distributed to the traffic departments of the Jinghu, Jinpu, and Beining Railways. Only the date and train number of the originating train should be entered in the date, train number, and other columns of the report. Article 7: Shanghai, Wuxi, Pukou, Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, the East Station, and Beiping should each prepare accommodations for the escorts. Shanghai and Wuxi should be prepared by the Jinghu Railway, Pukou, Xuzhou, Jinan, and the Tianjin West Station should be prepared by the Jinpu Railway, and the Tianjin East Station and Beiping should be prepared by the Beining Railway. Article 8: If the train is delayed, resulting in no return train the next day, the Shanghai or Beiping station should arrange for suitable wagons and assign personnel to supplement them. Article 9: If a wagon is damaged en route, the railway where it is located should allocate a wagon for transshipment. The procedure is as follows: (A) If wagons from the Jinghu or Beining Railway are damaged on the Jinpu Railway, the Jinpu Railway should allocate a wagon to replace it and repair the damaged wagon. Before the replacement wagon returns to the original railway of the damaged wagon, it should be returned to the original railway. After the original railway receives the repaired empty wagon, it should return the replacement wagon to the Jinpu Railway immediately after it arrives in Beiping or Shanghai. (B) If wagons from the Jinpu Railway are damaged on the Jinghu or Beining Railway, the respective railway should allocate a special wagon for replacement, and the damaged wagon should be repaired and returned to the original railway (Beiping or Shanghai) of the damaged wagon. (C) If wagons from the Beining Railway are damaged on the Jinghu Railway, or wagons from the Jinghu Railway are damaged on the Beining Railway, the procedure should be followed as in item (B). Article 10: Other matters should be handled in accordance with the regulations for less-than-carload freight trains promulgated by the Ministry. (Note: The regulations for through-service less-than-carload freight trains between Shanghai and Xi'an are identical to the above regulations, except for the place names.) (Details omitted)</p>

<h3>The Red Swastika Society Reports on the Disaster Situation in Henan Province</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Southeast Branches of the Red Swastika Society received a report from the Joint Office of Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces with very detailed investigations of the flood situation in Yanshi, Huaxian, Gongxian, Zhechuan, Zhangde, and Xiuwu counties in Henan. It is specially recorded as follows to inform those who are concerned about the disaster in Henan.</p>
<p>The people of Henan are unfortunate and plagued by disasters. This spring, drought was rampant, and recently there have been floods. People and animals have been submerged, houses have been turned to ruins. The various tragic situations are difficult to describe in writing. Our office is responsible for disaster relief and has already sent teams to handle emergency relief. We have also sent a dedicated team to investigate the disaster situation in various counties. The current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Henan Province has 85 counties, 1885 towns, and 13,609,370 people. According to the survey, 42 people have died as of when corpses are being retrieved. The total area of ​​farmland submerged in the whole county is 155,300 acres. Currently, the water in the city is of varying depths, with some places having over a foot. The number of people awaiting relief in various districts is 60,227.</p>
<p>1. Yancheng is the most severely affected. It first experienced drought and then flooding. The rivers overflowed their banks, the water was turbulent, dikes were breached, the water level was 1.2 feet high, submerging more than 8,700 households, collapsing more than 34,000 houses, drowning more than 100 people, submerging more than 300 villages, and destroying 50-60% of the crops in the county. The floodwater is still 6-7 feet deep in places. The number of disaster victims in various districts is 65,400.</p>
<p>2. Huaxian is the most severely affected. The terrain is low-lying. After the Yellow River breached its banks last year, the disasters have not ended. Now, due to heavy rains, the Zhanghe and Weihe rivers have also overflowed their banks, breaching dikes and flowing directly eastward, converging in the county and flooding more than 600 villages, surrounding the northwest side of the county seat, turning the area into a swamp. The water is 6-7 feet deep on the plains, drowning more than 5,760 people, collapsing 3,890 houses, submerging 80-90% of the crops in the county, killing more than 500 people and livestock, and destroying almost all of the food and clothing. The estimated property loss is more than 1.7 million yuan. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is more than 16,000.</p>
<p>3. Gongxian is the most severely affected. The old city is low-lying. The Luo River flooded, and the water upstream rushed like thousands of horses, overflowing its banks and directly hitting the villages of Guo Zhen, Luo Zhuang, Qing Yi Zhen, Heishi Guan, Xiao Yi Zhen, Baisha, Jiao Wan, Shi Guan, Shihui, and Shendi, Zhou, and other surrounding 200 villages, which were all turned into swamps. A total of over 4,100 households were submerged, more than 1,900 houses were collapsed, and the submerged farmland accounted for 40% of the county. Because the death of Yanshi has drowned, so the seriousness of the disaster in this area has not received much attention. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is 32,300. The estimated property loss is more than 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>4. Zhechuan is the most severely affected. It is located in the western frontier of Henan. It first suffered from banditry and then flooding. The disasters are overwhelming, and the severity is no less than in Yanshi. At that time, mountain torrents broke out, and the river water suddenly rose by a certain amount, a foot in height, with turbulent water, flooding the fields, accounting for 40% of the county, collapsing 1,400 houses, and drowning 1,500 households. The loss of food and property is estimated at 1.4 million yuan. Due to traffic obstructions, there is little news. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief with no food or clothing is more than 25,600.</p>
<p>5. Zhangde is the most severely affected. It first suffered from drought and then flooding. Due to heavy rains, mountain torrents broke out in the western Taihang Mountains. The Hongwei River surged, overflowing its banks and breaching dikes, submerging more than 150 villages, destroying crops, accounting for 20-30% of the county, collapsing more than 800 houses, and drowning more than 240 people and livestock. The estimated property loss is more than 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>6. Xiuwu is the second most severely affected. Due to heavy mountain torrents upstream, the river water suddenly rose, overflowing its banks and breaching dikes, rushing like galloping horses. The northeast area of ​​the county turned into a swamp, submerging more than 20 villages, collapsing 740 houses, and destroying farmland, accounting for 30% of the county, drowning 1,277 households and killing 280 people and livestock. The estimated loss of property and food is 530,000 yuan. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is more than 1,600.</p>
<p>7. Xiangxian is the second most severely affected. The Ru River suddenly rose, overflowing its banks and breaching dikes. More than 80 villages along the Ru River, such as Ludu Chang, were all flooded. The walls and houses collapsed in more than 180 places. The water was more than seven feet high, destroying crops, accounting for 20-30% of the county. The county is known as a tobacco leaf center, and the loss of tobacco leaves is no less than 100,000 jin. More than 720 households were drowned, and the estimated loss of property and food is 350,000 yuan. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is more than 3,900.</p>
<p>8. Xinye is the second most severely affected. It is located near the border between Hubei and Henan. The upper reaches of the Xiang River suddenly rose, overflowing its banks and breaching dikes, directly flowing into Xinye. The waves were turbulent and very rapid. The water was more than one foot high, destroying crops, accounting for 130-40% of the county, collapsing more than 1,800 houses, and submerging more than 4,650 households. More than 280 people and livestock were killed. The estimated loss of property and food is more than 380,000 yuan. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is more than 14,300. Because the county is remote in the southwest and traffic is obstructed, news is scarce.</p>
<p>9. The residents along the Yi and Luo rivers are the second most severely affected. The river water surged, the water was rapid, and the ground cracked. More than 3,600 houses collapsed. More than 1,200 people were unable to escape and fell into the water, drifting with the waves, and destroyed more than 100,000 acres of farmland.

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Investigates the Industrial Situation in this City; Sends Letters to Various Factories to Conduct a General Survey; Compiles the Collected Materials into a Directory of Factories</h3>
<p>In order to understand the industrial situation in this city and provide a reference for guidance and improvement, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has sent letters to various factories to conduct a general survey. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Sending Letters to Various Factories</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs sent letters to various factories stating: We are writing to inform you that in order to understand the industrial situation in this city, we have been conducting a general survey once a year and compiling the collected materials into a "Directory of Factories" for reference by all sectors of society. Last year's publication of the book was well received by society. The advertising effect on the factory side was significant. On the merchant side, it also provides guidance for the procurement and sales of goods. This year, we will continue to follow the old practice and conduct this survey. We have enclosed a blank survey form. We hope that your factory will continue to uphold the spirit of assistance from previous years, fill it out in detail, and send it back to us.</p>
<p>Survey Items</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Survey includes the following items: (A) Factory Name, (B) Address, (1) Factory, (2) Distribution Office, (C) Factory Director and Manager, (D) Capital Amount (kept confidential by the Bureau and not published), (E) Products, (1) Main Products and Annual Output, (2) By-products and Annual Output, (F) Power Source, (1) Type, (2) Energy, (G) Number of Workers, (1) Male Workers, (2) Female Workers, (3) Child Laborers, (4) Apprentices, (H) Trademark Name, (I) Date of Registration of Business or Company.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Stipulates the Method for Calculating the Fare for Special Trains; Based on the Number of First-Class Passengers at 100; Delay Fee Must Be Charged for Stopping En Route</h3>
<p>The two railway administrations received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating: According to the case presented by the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways regarding the 84th proposal of the Ninth National Railway Transportation Conference, the Jinghu-Huhangyong Railway proposed how to calculate the fare for special trains. The conference has decided in the 85th resolution, "(1) The fare for the above special train should be calculated according to the fare of the regular train. (2) Add 'and the group discount method can be applied' to the end of item (inside) of Article 34 of the Passenger Transport Regulations." This is feasible. The third to fourth articles of the transport regulations for each train are amended as follows: (C) If the number of passengers in first class is 100 or more, or in second class is 100 or more, or in third class is 200 or more, regardless of whether it is a one-way or round trip, and the mileage is more than 50 kilometers, in addition to being exempt from the special train fee, the group discount method can also be applied, and the fare is charged according to the regular train fare. However, the group discount method cannot be applied if the special train is designated by the traveler to depart and arrive at the destination, and the actual number of members in the group does not meet the requirements for 100. If the passengers on the special train hold different classes of tickets, the following conversion method should be used to calculate the fare. In addition to separate orders, they should be followed. Attached is the full text of Article 34 of the Passenger Transport Regulations. Article 34: If passengers need to open a special train, they must consult with the Director of Traffic or the Traffic Section Chief by letter at least 48 hours before the need. If there is no hindrance to the transportation situation, it can be followed. The methods are as follows: (A) If passengers need to open a special train, the special train fee, in addition to the fare and freight that should be paid, should be charged 3 yuan per kilometer for a one-way trip and 2 yuan per kilometer for a round trip. If the round trip is within 24 hours, 2.5 yuan per kilometer should be charged. (B) The special train fee, whether one-way or round trip, should be at least 100 yuan (C) has been amended, and the original scheduled time will be used. If the railway has losses due to ratio, it should first notify the correction of the scheduled time for each hour to avoid losses to the railway, and the delay fee should be exempted.</p>
<h3>News from the Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>The First Special District Rent Reduction Committee, in light of the current commercial depression and the unbearable burden of existing rents, is requesting a 40% rent reduction to maintain stability. It has decided to send representatives this Wednesday to petition Party and government organs for a clear mandate for rent reduction. It is learned that the committee, due to frequent rent disputes in various districts and tenants often being unaware of legal principles, leading to unexpected incidents, has established a tenant rent reduction consultation office to facilitate consultations for tenants in various districts and provide legal advice. Legal experts have been appointed to reside there daily to provide consultations at any time. Starting today, the office will be open at the First Special District Citizens' Association, north of the Tianhou Palace Bridge.</p>
<p>New Taian Lane, owned by Bei Runsheng, had fixed rental rates of thirty taels per building and forty taels per storefront due to the prosperous market before the January 28th Incident. After the January 28th Incident, the market declined, and the situation worsened daily. The daily business income of shops often did not cover rent expenses, and those in arrears accounted for more than 80% of the entire lane. Old Taian Lane, adjacent to it, is also owned by the Bei family, with rents estimated at twenty-two taels. Tenants believe that the landlords should not discriminate between them, as the treatment is unfair. Given the significant drop in real estate prices, they have proposed rent reductions to the landlord, but negotiations have only led to agreements to reduce rent by 20% for residences and 20% for storefronts, which is far from the tenants' demands. Both parties remain steadfast in this dispute. Recently, Tailey &amp; Co. suddenly issued a notice to tenants, demanding that all arrears be paid within five days, worsening the atmosphere. Storefronts along the street and lane representatives Qiu Minzhong, He Zhifa, Tu Daqi, Lu Rongtang, Jiang Zonghai, Cai Xueqing, Li Daozhou, Fan Yuansheng, Wang Henian, Ma Guifa, Jia Shuling, Zhou Qing, Ni Songnian, Ge Zuying, and over eighty others went to the 36th branch of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to request assistance and made the following resolutions on the spot: (1) Send a letter to landlord Bei Runsheng, requesting a reduction of at least 30% for storefront rents and at least 20% for residential rents. Arrears will be paid in installments after the rent reduction is resolved. (2) Those who privately pay rent before the case is resolved will be held fully responsible for undermining the collective effort. (3) If one household is sued, the entire group will provide assistance and share the litigation costs. (4) If one household is sealed, everyone will be prepared to sacrifice everything. The atmosphere during the discussion was tense, with a sense of no turning back.</p>
<p>The tenants of Dunhe Lane on Route La Tou in the French Concession, feeling that rents are too high, have united to form the Dunhe Lane Branch of the 8th District Branch of the Second Special District Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to implement rent reduction measures. They have sent a letter to the managing agent, Tailey &amp; Co., requesting a 30% rent reduction, to be implemented from July. Unexpectedly, the other day, a rent collector named Liu, accompanied by Wu, a representative of Zikang Qianzhuang, the landlord of the lane, went to each tenant and made an oral announcement, "The managing agent and landlord, in consideration of the heavy burden on tenants, have approved a 10% rent reduction, starting from September 1st, implementing a 10% discount on rent. However, tenants must pay off all previous arrears to enjoy the rent reduction." A tenant immediately questioned them, "If the landlord is sincerely reducing rent, then the 10% reduction is too small, showing no genuine consideration for tenants. Moreover, any notice of rent reduction should be sent in writing to our organized branch." Wu and Liu replied, "Don't believe in the association. The landlord doesn't recognize any association, only the tenants." The tenant immediately retorted, "The Dunhe Lane Branch is the association of Dunhe Lane tenants. Therefore, the tenants are the association, and the association is the tenants." Wu and Liu were speechless and left. Upon hearing this oral announcement, the tenants convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. to discuss the matter. They unanimously resolved that a 30% rent reduction is necessary and will not stop until the goal is achieved. The tenants consider the rent collector's oral announcement unreasonable and decided to ignore it. They also announced that any tenant who undermines the association's affairs will be considered a public enemy. They sent another letter to Tailey &amp; Co., urging a clear response on the 30% rent reduction starting from July 1st, with a deadline of five days. It is learned that Tailey &amp; Co. sent a letter to the 8th District Branch of the Municipal Association of Trade Unions on August 1st, asking them to relay to all tenants to pay rent according to the original amount. If they find the rent expensive, they can move elsewhere. This shows that the oral announcement by the rent collector Liu and others is not genuine and may be a strategy of the landlord. Therefore, the branch again notified all tenants yesterday to unite, obey the association's discipline, and not fall for the landlord's divisive tactics.</p>
<h3>Bar Association - Measures to Assist Criminals After Release From Prison - Original Proposer Song Shixiang Sends Letter Urging Action</h3>
<p>Lawyer Song Shixiang and over twenty others submitted a proposal at this year's spring conference of the Shanghai Bar Association, regarding the livelihood of criminals after their release from prison, or repatriation to their original domicile, requesting a discussion on the organization of an association to protect released prisoners. The conference voted to refer the matter to the new executive and supervisory committee for discussion. Having been delayed until now without any measures being discussed, member Song recently sent a letter to the Bar Association urging them to decide on measures as soon as possible. The association has now appointed a review committee to finalize the review and will submit it to the next joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion.</p>

<h3>Zhenxiang and Subsequent Handling of the Xinmaoli Steamboat Accident - Letter from Dinghai County Government to Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association</h3>
<p>The Dinghai Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, considering the tragic sinking of the Xinmaoli steamboat at the Dinghai pier a matter of great importance to the lives of fellow townsmen, held a meeting on the 29th of last month to discuss countermeasures and sent a letter to the Dinghai County Government requesting a thorough investigation. The association has now received a reply from the Dinghai County Government, providing a detailed account of the true circumstances of the accident and the subsequent handling. The original letter is transcribed below (excerpt): "After the steamboat arrived at the street pier at around 5 p.m. on July 12th and unloaded its cargo, the boat suddenly tilted towards the pier and sank after about ten minutes. At that time, all the local passengers had disembarked. All the passengers who had not disembarked were from Taizhou. Upon receiving a telephone report from Meng, a police officer from the street police station, the Public Security Section and security team were immediately dispatched to the pier for rescue. Pu [referring to the county magistrate] also personally rushed to the scene. Simultaneously, the street township office, relief home, and Baoding fire brigade were instructed to jointly establish a refugee shelter, and three measures were determined: (1) The divers hired by Xinmaoli should give priority to salvaging bodies. (2) Families of the deceased should be allowed to register the names and number of the deceased. (3) The steamboat company should provide appropriate compensation to the families of the deceased. On that day, a total of more than 400 refugees were rescued. In addition to providing food and lodging at the shelter, the company repatriated them to their hometowns one by one the next day. The company provided compensation ranging from ten to twenty yuan to the families of the victims. As of the 25th of last month, ten bodies had been salvaged, seven of which had been claimed. Various charitable organizations provided coffins and burial services. As for the issue of compensation, Chen Renshi was instructed to earnestly negotiate with the company. Chen said yesterday that it would have to wait for the old boss of the Shanghai company, Hong Baoshun, to make a decision. The main causes of the accident can be summarized as follows: (1) Both the chief mate and the second mate were novices who could not regulate the cold and hot water pipes, causing water to enter the engine room. (2) The cargo was loaded with the front light and the rear heavy, and the top heavy and the bottom light. For example, there were more than 500 packages of paper from Huangyan, all loaded at the bottom, causing the boat to be unstable. The above is the handling of the aftermath of the Xinmaoli steamboat accident and the truth of the incident. The reply is sent accordingly, for your information."</p>

Jin Runxiang, Ma Shaoquan, Luo Qinghua, Yan Esheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Shizhao, Yuan Yunxing, Qin Kai from the Huaying liquidator attended. Jin Runxiang chaired the meeting and reported that the liquidator's request had been accepted. The standing committee decided to protect the interests of creditors and reduce losses, so a reconciliation meeting was convened to facilitate reconciliation and end the case as soon as possible. Then, Yan Esheng read a letter, Ma Shaoquan reported on the balance sheet, and Luo Qinghua reported on the reconciliation plan. The reconciliation plan was unanimously approved, as follows: A. The assets of the pharmacy consist mainly of Western medicine raw materials (i.e., inventory), with a book value of over 620,000 yuan, accounting for more than 60% of the total assets. Given the current market conditions, even a discounted bulk sale would likely find no buyers. If bankruptcy were declared in court, the various legal procedures would take a long time, and the medicines might lose their effectiveness, resulting in greater losses for creditors. Therefore, it is requested that under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the pharmacy be opened for retail sales, and the proceeds, after deducting necessary expenses, be distributed pro rata to all creditors. The following measures are proposed: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send personnel, and creditors will elect twelve representatives, including two from the silver and money industry, one from the upper ranks, and eight depositors, to jointly supervise the opening of the pharmacy for sales. It will be temporarily limited to three months, and the entire inventory will be sold in batches through both wholesale and retail channels. All sales will be for cash only, with no credit or offsetting of accounts. (2) The pharmacy will categorize and classify all inventory, check quantities, mark wholesale and retail prices, and prepare a list to be submitted to the Western Medicine Industry Association for review to determine whether the prices are appropriate. (3) Daily sales proceeds will be deposited in the Central Bank. When there are sufficient funds to distribute 10%, a distribution list will be prepared, approved by the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and announced for distribution on a fixed date. (4) The opening date for sales is tentatively set for three months. If sales are brisk after opening, and the inventory is sold out early, or if the fast-moving goods have been sold out, and the remaining slow-moving goods are difficult to sell, the situation will be considered, and sales will be stopped at any time. Other disposal methods will be considered, so as not to incur excessive expenses and cause greater losses to creditors. (5) The sales personnel to be hired after opening, and all necessary management expenses, should be increased or decreased as appropriate. (6) Other detailed procedures regarding the opening of sales and management will be stipulated separately to ensure strictness. B. Other assets of the pharmacy, such as outstanding accounts receivable and real estate, should be disposed of, sold, and collected as soon as possible under the supervision of the Chamber of Commerce by the liquidator and creditor representatives, so as to obtain cash early and repay the creditors. C. After the above two types of assets, A and B, have been disposed of and the proceeds distributed in full to the creditors, it will be considered a complete settlement. The creditor representatives will be elected by mail next week, and the date for opening sales will be set later.</p>
<h3>Su-Hu Highway: Su-Kun Section Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The fare is 45 cents for the entire 34 kilometers. The Road Bureau and Kun County met yesterday to plan the construction of the Qingyang branch line.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction are jointly building the Hu-Su Highway, which is 75 kilometers long. The section south of the Jing-Hu Road, from Suzhou to Kunshan, is being built by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, while the section from Kunshan to Nanxiang is being built by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The entire project cost 800,000 yuan and took nearly a year to build. All 87 bridges have been completed. A reporter from the East China News Agency inspected the Su-Hu line by car yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>The Su-Kun section of the Su-Hu Road was opened yesterday, with Shen Shaozeng appointed as the director of preparation. The entire line starts from Jinmen in Suzhou, passes through Guanlu Li, Wai Kuatang, Weiting, Zhengyi, and ends at Zhengyang Bridge in Kunshan, totaling 34 kilometers. The fare from Suzhou to Kunshan is 45 cents for the entire route. The fares for different sections are as follows: Suzhou to Guanlu Li is 8 cents, Suzhou to Wai Kuatang is 19 cents, to Weiting is 30 cents, to Zhengyi is 35 cents, and to Kunshan. Shen Shaozeng and others have been appointed as the stationmasters of the two major stations in Kunshan and Weiting. Other stations are being handled by nearby stores. The Suzhou station is attached to the Su-Jia station, and the Kunshan station is temporarily handled by the Zhengtai Hotel. The person in charge of the management office also said that four Ford cars have been delivered for passenger transport, and more will be added soon to alleviate the travel difficulties. Extra trips will be added for transportation.</p>
<p>Hu-Kun Section</p>
<p>The route from Kunshan passes through Lvjia Bang, Huajia Bridge, Xu Gongqiao, Anting, Huangdu, Nanxiang, and connects to Zhenbei Road (Zhenru North Station), directly reaching Shanghai, totaling 41 kilometers. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic early next month.</p>
<p>Qingyang Branch Line</p>
<p>Bridge No. 50 on the Qingyanggang of the Hu-Kun section of the road is about one kilometer from the Railway Garden Hotel. Therefore, the Kunshan County Government has planned to build a branch road to directly reach the Railway Garden. Yesterday, Section Chief Mei of the First Section of the County Government told the East China News Agency that the branch road has been surveyed and measured, totaling kilometers in length. The total construction cost is estimated to be 10,000 yuan. The road company inside and outside the county city is willing to undertake 3,000 yuan, and the remaining amount will be partly paid by the county government applying to the provincial government for allocation from the county's construction fund, and partly by requesting the Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railway Bureaus to undertake. Construction will begin as soon as funding is secured. Yesterday afternoon, Kunshan County Magistrate Peng Baichuan, Deputy Directors of the two Railway Bureaus Wu Shaozeng, etc., held a meeting at the Qingyanggang Railway Hotel to discuss the matter. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that construction will begin as soon as funding is secured.</p>
<p>Boundary Sections</p>
<p>The Su-Hu Highway has been completed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Construction Department in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government. The boundary sections were originally delimited by Kunshan. The section from Kunshan west to Suzhou was built by the Su-Kun Road Engineering Office, and the section from Kunshan east to Nanxiang was built by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Later, due to funding issues, the Shanghai Municipal Government sent personnel to the Provincial Government to negotiate and decided to use Xiajia River (Qingyanggang in Kunshan County) as the boundary. The section west of Xiajia River was built by the Provincial Government, and the section east of Xiajia River was built by the Municipal Government. The Qingyanggang Bridge and Xiajia River Bridge were built by the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Suspended Due to Rain</p>
<p>According to Station Master Shen of Kunshan Station, the road surface of the Su-Hu Highway is entirely paved with coal cinder, and the lower layer of the coal cinder is earth. Therefore, when it rains, all passenger cars traveling on the Kun section must be suspended. Due to the urgent need to open the Su-Kun section, the station buildings in each station are temporarily built with straw sheds, which may need to be rebuilt in the future.</p>
<h3>Announcement by Xihu Company: The Entire Route Will Open for Business on the 17th</h3>

<h3>Citywide Slum Survey Completed - Two Bureaus Meet to Discuss Relief Measures - Construction of Public Housing to Begin After Reporting to the Municipal Government - Fire Protection Equipment in Factories in the South Shanghai District Has Been Inspected</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau started improving the fire protection equipment in various factories, the inspection of the South Shanghai District has been completed. The next steps are to continue the inspection in Zhabei and Pudong, eliminate the shantytowns, and rebuild public housing. The Social and Public Security Bureaus are jointly formulating plans and budgets. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Improving Fire Protection in Three Major Districts</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that the internal equipment of various factories in recent years has been difficult due to limited resources, has been forced to make do, resulting in frequent accidents. The local security and the lives of workers are of great importance. If active improvements are not made, the level of danger in the future, or the occurrence of tragedies, will be even worse than in the past. Therefore, it has specifically designated South Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong, areas with a high concentration of factories, to implement the supervision of factory owners to equip fire protection equipment, and the Public Security Bureau will send personnel to conduct inspections together with the sub-bureaus and fire brigades in the jurisdictions.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Completed - Zhabei Begins</p>
<p>The total number of large and small factories in the South Shanghai District is more than 1,200, located in areas such as Xieqiao, Lujiabang, Hujunying, Gaochangmiao, Rihuigang, Lujiawan, Luban Road, Xiexu Road, Pingying Bridge, Dapu Bridge, Damu Bridge, Xiaomu Bridge, Longhua, and along the South Huangpu River. Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the Laoximen Sub-Bureau, the West District, East District, and fire brigade personnel, started inspecting the fire protection equipment in various factories, the South Shanghai District has been largely completed. The inspection is now continuing in the Zhabei and Pudong districts. During the inspection, attention is paid to the construction of buildings, the location of factories and boilers, and factory owners are supervised to reform fire protection equipment at any time. Special attention is paid to factories containing flammable or explosive materials, so that the factories are isolated, and more fire extinguishers are installed to ensure the safety of workers' lives.</p>
<p>Public Housing - Jointly Formulating Plans</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important trading port, and it is related to the international outlook. In the prosperous city, shantytowns are still mixed, but these are where the general poor live. It is actually very difficult to ban them within a limited time. Although the Municipal Government has built some public housing, the number is limited, and it has not been able to accommodate all of them. Therefore, they are allowed to build their own thatched huts, rising and falling like barracks, stretching for dozens or hundreds of rooms. In the event of a fire alarm, it is impossible to contain the spread, and fire fighting is like pouring a cup of water on a cart of burning wood. In order to fundamentally alleviate the situation, the Municipal Government has ordered the Social and Public Security Bureaus to investigate the number of shantytowns and the total population of the poor in the city, and to build public housing for them. According to the reporter of Dagon Social News, who inquired with the Public Security Bureau, the work of surveying the population of shantytowns has been completed. The two bureaus are currently jointly formulating plans to add public housing, and the entire budget will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval before construction begins.</p>

<h3>Rapid Rise in River Levels Along the Yangtze - All Vessels Must Report to the Navigation Administration - The Navigation Administration Receives Instructions from the Ministry of Communications - Already Ordered All Shipping Companies to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications instructed the local Navigation Administration, stating: The Executive Yuan's instruction No. 3511 dated June 21 of this year included the National Economic Council's (Council) (Water) letter No. 6030, which stated: The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission reported that the Yangtze River Flood Control Conference, as proposed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, identified three aspects requiring attention for the Yangtze River flood control efforts: manpower, materials, and transportation. Regarding transportation, the original proposal emphasized the importance of timely information and convenient transport during the flood control emergency period, including the reporting of water levels and the replenishment of materials. It suggested maximizing the utilization of existing transportation infrastructure in the provinces along the river, such as long-distance telephones, highways, railways, telegraphs, and waterway transport using steamships and land transport using automobiles adjacent to the levees, and consulting with relevant authorities beforehand to ensure convenience. The proposal requested the Council to forward a letter to the Executive Yuan, instructing relevant transportation authorities to provide full assistance to flood control agencies along the river for information transmission and material transport when necessary. Based on this, it was determined that the points mentioned in the original proposal were crucial for flood control. With the flood season approaching, all transportation-related assistance should be provided. It was requested that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, along with the provincial governments along the river, be notified to provide coordinated assistance to benefit flood control and alleviate disasters. Accordingly, instructions were issued separately to the Ministry of Railways and the provincial governments along the river to provide coordinated assistance, and a reply was sent. The Ministry was also instructed to promptly instruct its subordinates to provide coordinated assistance. This order was issued because it was determined that all vessels navigating the Yangtze River should promptly report any sudden increases or changes in water levels to the nearest navigation authorities or customs offices for relay to flood control agencies along the river. The Navigation Administration, upon receiving the order, has already instructed all shipping companies to comply.</p>
<h3>Bund Park - Tourist Suddenly Jumps into the River - Body Surfaces Briefly, then Sinks Again</h3>

The sound startled the visitors, who rushed forward to attempt a rescue, but they could not find the man in the darkness. A short white cloth shirt was found left on the riverside. Patrol officer No. 76 and Chinese constable No. 2816 took the abandoned clothing to the police station and telegraphed the Customs River Police to investigate. Around 5:30 PM yesterday evening, the deceased's body briefly surfaced at the same location. Park visitors saw the head and chest of the body and reported it to the River Police, who immediately dispatched a gasoline-powered boat to attempt a retrieval.

<h3>Various Muslim Organizations - Welcome Yin Guangyu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Various Muslim organizations held a welcome gathering for Yin Guangyu's return to China yesterday at 3 PM at No. 222 Qingnian Street in the city.

However, Mr. Yin Guangyu, representative of the Taiyuan Islamic Preaching Association, has done much to study religious conditions abroad and share his findings with the Chinese people. He was introduced to the attendees and invited to speak about his experiences abroad. Mr. Yin then gave a lengthy speech, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Egypt is the oldest country in Arab culture, founded in 4000 BC. Its culture was highly developed over 2500 years ago. Al-Azhar University is the world's highest institution of learning, founded 300 years into the Islamic calendar, and has been in existence for over 1000 years. (2) Arabia currently has a population of over 3 million and is actively engaged in construction. The completed motorways account for one-third of the country's total. It plans to invest 4 million platinum coins in building a convenient national railway system. (3) Jerusalem's Palestine is the birthplace of the three major religions. Muslims currently make up 70% of the population, Jews 20%, and Christians (including Catholics, Protestants, etc.) 10%. The people's love for their religion is extremely strong, and they will not buy items from outside their religious community, embodying a spirit worthy of admiration. The speech concluded at 7 PM, followed immediately by a dinner reception.</p>

Its mission is to promote Eastern culture and integrate Western science to create a new world culture.

<h3>National Goods World - Requests Factory Association to Conduct On-Site Review</h3>
<p>The National Goods World on Nanjing Road has reached its one-week anniversary since its opening yesterday. According to the person in charge, the number of visitors has exceeded 200,000, and the total revenue is around 10,000 yuan. The goods sold by the participating factories are all purely national products, which have been carefully reviewed by the inspection department before being allowed to be sold. To gain the trust of the public, the National Goods World specially sent a letter to the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association yesterday, requesting the organization of a review committee to conduct another review and announce the results to the public. The original letter is transcribed as follows: Respectfully, since the opening of our business on the 5th of this month, the number of visitors has been over 30,000 per day, indicating that the public has a good impression of using national goods. However, at this stage when national goods are just budding, unscrupulous merchants often mix foreign goods into them and sell them deceptively in order to seek huge profits, which is heartbreaking. From the beginning of our business, we have paid close attention to this, so all products sold by the participating factories have been strictly reviewed before being allowed to be displayed and sold. However, without a review by a fair national goods organization, it is not enough to gain the trust of the public. We have always admired your association as a leading factory group of national goods, so we would like to request the organization of a National Goods World Review Committee to come to the business for review, to assess the quality of the products, and to provide rewards and guidance. We also request that the review results be announced to the public to demonstrate credibility. This is a matter of public interest. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Grandeur of the Xujiahui Exhibition</h3>
<p>Closing in Three Weeks - Planning a National Exhibition in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Xujiahui National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association, has been held since its opening on the 28th of last month. The participating major factories offer high-quality goods at low prices, all embracing the principle of sacrifice and promotion in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of those who love to use national goods. This has greatly aroused the enthusiasm of the people in the western part of Shanghai and the towns of Kun and Su to visit and purchase. On average, over 10,000 people visit every day, especially when the sun sets and the cool breeze arrives, men and women from all walks of life come together, making it very crowded, almost to the point of not being able to accommodate them. The sales volume of each product is extremely prosperous. In the first week, the total sales were over 18,400 yuan, and in the second week, the total sales were over 22,500 yuan, which is a great help to the economic decline of the factories, expressing infinite joy. Among them, the mosquito incense of China Chemical Industry Co., the Samsung cosmetics, the men's and women's rubber shoes of the Great China Rubber Factory, the soy milk and beef of the Tiantian Company, the various fabrics of the Renfeng Textile Factory, the summer silks and yarns of the Meiya Silk Factory, the aluminum utensils of the Huachang Steel Factory, the biscuits of the Taikang Food Company, the undershirts of the Wuhe Weaving Factory, the solid soap of the Wuzhou Gubenzao Pharmaceutical Factory, the Ningkang toothpaste of the Shende Chemical Company, the waterproof of the Lianpu Company, and the silk socks of the Zhengda Knitting Factory are the most popular. It is expected that there will be a tendency to exceed the record in the second week. It is known that the association has always strictly followed its regulations and decided to announce the closure of the exhibition on the 17th after three weeks. According to the person in charge, in response to the demands of the small and medium-sized factory members, the association will continue to expand the promotion of national goods and relieve overproduction, and is preparing for the third National Goods Exhibition in Western Shanghai, and registration will begin immediately.</p>

<h3>Record of the Fifth Team Members' Meeting of the Yangjing District Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Since Zhang Zhongxiu took office as the captain of the Fifth Team of the Pudong Yangjing District Defense Corps, he has devoted himself to reorganization without sparing any effort, and has been deeply loved by all team members. Because Zhang is moving to Shanghai and is busy with business, it is difficult for him to take care of the team affairs. On the 8th, he submitted his resignation to the team headquarters. Deputy Captain Shen believed that leadership could not be without someone for a day, so he immediately convened a meeting of all team members yesterday morning at 10 AM. 46 people attended, chaired by Dong Aosheng. After deliberation, it was decided to elect four representatives, Zhang Linhua, Lu Yunlin, Wang Zhixin, and Luo Hanren, to persuade the captain to stay. If the persuasion is unsuccessful, it is proposed to reinstate the former captain Zhang Shangzhen. After the meeting, the four representatives faced Captain Zhang and earnestly persuaded him to stay, but Zhang's resignation was firm and he could not be persuaded. Then the four representatives turned to the former Captain Zhang to inquire about his consent. It is heard that Zhang is still considering. Deputy Captain Shen has reported the situation to the group headquarters for approval.</p>

<h3>French Concession Increases Cigarette Tax - Same Trade Asks Chamber of Commerce to Negotiate Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Trade Association, because the French Concession Board of Directors collected cigarette tax from the same trade in the concession, and increased it to double the amount in June, the same trade members were generally unable to make profits due to poor business, and repeatedly asked the association for relief. In addition to sending a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to request, the association also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: It was found that on the 22nd of this month, the association received a joint letter from members Gan Ruihe, Rui Dayong, Rui Tai, Guangda, Yingchang, and Heng Hexiang, stating that since June, the French Bureau of Works has sent personnel to collect cigarette tax from our company, and repeatedly threatened and forced payment because they had to increase the amount by twice. If they did not pay as required, they would be punished. At that time, our company was under coercion and had no way to appeal, so we had to bear the pain and raise money to pay. Looking around, all industries are depressed, and our industry is even more so. It is difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone bear heavy burdens. We hereby jointly write to your association to forward a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice. It was found that Gan Ruihe and other companies used to pay 2.8 yuan per month for cigarette tax, but now it has been increased to 5.6 yuan. Moreover, Gan Ruihe et al. are all single-fronted shops, and the scope of business is very small. In addition, the price of foreign goods has increased sharply recently, and there is no profit to be made. After the roof leaks, how can we continue to face the wind and rain? We hereby submit our difficult situation and send a letter to your association to forward a letter to the French Concession Board of Directors, hoping that the original amount will still be collected from July to save the dangerous situation of the same trade. According to the previous situation in the letter, a corresponding letter is sent to you, hoping that you will quickly review and forward it, which is a matter of public interest.</p>
<h3>Xinwei Relief Association - Sends Tibetan Lamas Back to the North - Depleted of Funds in Shanghai from Putuo - Will Be Sent by China Merchants Bureau Ship Tomorrow</h3>

He lived there for several days without any unusual behavior. However, two young girls often lingered in the room, and the sound of talking and laughing reached the outside. At about 5:30 in the morning yesterday, Wang Ruihua had the idea of ​​dying and suddenly committed suicide by taking raw opium.

<h3>Bloodstains on Axe Not Blood; Song Guanlong Granted Release</h3>

Suddenly, he was attacked by an enemy with an axe, injuring his right temple. The assailant fled without a trace. Huang was sent to the hospital for treatment but died due to the severity of his injuries. Before his death, he stated that he had previously contracted with Song Guanlong, a Chuansha native living at Lane 8, North Street, Yinxiang Port, for the wooden barrel business at the China Nail Factory at 85 Funing Road. Recently, he had been handling the contract work independently, and perhaps Song harbored resentment over this business relationship and committed this malicious act. He claimed he had no other enemies. The Chinese and Western detectives from the Yulin Road police station, based on Huang's dying words, secretly went to the address and arrested Song, finding an axe with purplish bloodstains on it. Both were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. Song Guanlong vehemently denied the charges, and his lawyer, Jiang Baoli, argued that the bloodstains on the axe could be tested to determine if they were human blood, making the truth easily distinguishable. The court ordered Song to be temporarily detained and set a new date for further investigation. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial at the Third Criminal Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the purplish stains on the axe had been examined by a Western staff member, Nai Yige, from the Health Bureau and confirmed not to be blood. He requested the release of Song. Judge Xiao ordered Song Guanlong to be released.</p>

<p>Wang Yin, a Shaoxing native and former law firm clerk, 37 years old this year, was reported to the police by Zhang, who felt aggrieved. Detective Supervisor Wang Zhihao arrested both Wang and Wang. It was found that on May 20th, Wang, under the pretense of investigation, extorted 13 yuan from Xu Laikang, a vendor at the Taiping Bridge vegetable market. On May 26th, they impersonated detectives from the Yucai police station and searched the home of Liu Hanzhang, a Ningbo native, at 6 Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, under the pretext of searching for opium. They found an opium pipe and demanded money. They took Liu to the police station, but because Liu refused to pay, Wang and his cohorts had no choice but to release him midway. Based on the intelligence report, the police chief sent Wang and Wang to the Second Special District Court, where the police department's lawyer prosecuted them for extortion. After trial, Wang Yin and Wang Baosheng were sentenced to imprisonment on June 30th, as previously reported in the newspaper. Because Wang and the others did not accept the verdict, they filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court accepted the appeal, and the trial was conducted the day before yesterday by Judges Sun Honglin, Zhang Chaozuo, and Wang Yue, together with Prosecutor Dong Qi. Judge Sun served as the presiding judge, and the two appellants were brought to court for questioning. Both denied the extortion charges. Wang claimed that he had returned to Shaoxing in May when he heard that Shaoxing tea had been put on the market and could not have participated in the extortion. He blamed the events of June 8th on the absconded Xu and Xie. Wang claimed he was just passing by and invited to the scene, unaware of the extortion. After questioning the plaintiffs and the detectives who handled the case, the debate concluded, and the court announced that it would issue a verdict at a later date. The appellants were returned to custody to await the verdict.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, According to Zhang Qizhong, Chen Ruitao, and other worker representatives of the Taifeng Company, they have read the news item in your newspaper of the 9th of this month, stating that the workers of the Taifeng Biscuit Factory agreed to use the remaining wheat flour at its converted value as severance pay. This is not in accordance with the facts. The company has a total of over two hundred and fifty workers, and they were ordered by the liquidation committee to manufacture the stored raw materials into finished products for sale. They are currently still working, and there is no issue of dismissal, let alone agreeing to use this as severance pay. The previous news item is clearly inaccurate. Fearing that the outside world does not know the truth, they have entrusted me to write a letter requesting a correction in accordance with the rules, to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Lawyer Yi Guangding, August 11th.</p>

<h3>Little Men (12)</h3>
<p>— Original work by American Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>A burst of cheers from the depths of the children's hearts was more rewarding to him than throwing many coins. He stopped and looked around him as if to say:</p>
<p>"I have exhausted my heart, please appreciate this."</p>
<p>"I said, you played really well," Tao Mo said, regarding himself as if he were the Grand Duke of Nade.</p>
<p>Fu Lang smiled and nodded, "You can come to my band and be the first violinist."</p>
<p>Mrs. Pei said softly to her husband:</p>
<p>"Tanti is not bad: this child can indeed be made." After Mr. Pei opened his mouth, he nodded again and again, and patted Nade's shoulder with all his heart and said:</p>
<p>"You play well, my son. Now play something we can sing."</p>
<p>Then came the most glorious and happiest moment in the poor child's life. He was led to the side of the piano, surrounded by children, not paying attention to his worn-out clothes, looking at him with loving respect, eagerly waiting to hear his replay.</p>
<p>They chose a song that he knew, adjusted the strings, and they began to play, so the violin, flute, and piano led the children to sing in unison, resounding through the house. At this point, the fragile Nade could not bear it anymore; when the final call gradually subsided, the muscles on his face began to twitch, he let go of the violin, faced the wall, and cried like a five- or six-year-old child.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pei was singing very enthusiastically, while trying to prevent little Robert from stomping his boots to the beat. Suddenly, she saw Nade crying and hurriedly opened the way: "My dear, what is this?"</p>
<p>"Everyone is so good to me—better than I could have imagined! I can't help it," Nade cried, coughing so much that he couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>"Come with me, darling; you have to go to sleep now and get a good rest; you are tired, and it is very lively here," Mrs. Pei said softly to him; she took him by the arm and led him to her own seat and asked him to cry until he calmed down.</p>

<h3>As Expected, Xu Chengji Also Defeated Qiu Feihai. Old Qiu Tried His Best to Cope, But Eventually Succumbed. Xu-Ka Double Victory Over Lin Peng Was Wonderful.</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the performance of our Taiwanese player Xu Chengji. Against veteran Qiu Feihai, Xu Chengji won two sets in a row with 7-5 and 6-1, and the victory was extremely easy. Xu had already defeated Karlsson on the first day, so yesterday's victory over Qiu Feihai was originally expected. After the singles, a torrential rain suddenly poured down. Half an hour later, the doubles match continued, which was extremely exciting. Xu Chengji and Karlsson won three straight sets against Lin Baohua and Peng Nafei. The 700-800 spectators of the Chinese Tennis Association all returned with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Came from Behind</p>
<p>Old Qiu yesterday's battle against Xu Chengji, almost used all his skills to pay for it. Qiu served first. After one to one, Qiu relied on his two deep crosscourt shots and the seven-point sideline ball to beat Xu with three to one. Xu then took to the net to kill, followed by the service game, chasing to three to three. Xu served three heavy balls in a row, and then became four to four. Then, he took the lead with five to four. According to the battle, it is conceivable that in the next game, Xu served and lost at zero-forty, but he turned defeat into victory and became five to five. After this fierce battle, Old Qiu's fatigue was already visible, and Xu then won another game in a row.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Was Unable to Cope</p>
<p>Old and declining, Old Qiu in the second set was already like a turtle in a jar, no longer full of vitality. He could not get the ball over the net, and because he was exhausted, he had no control over his arms, and the balls went out of bounds repeatedly, let alone resist Xu Chengji's incoming balls. One game after another, it became four to zero, almost like the possibility of the first set. He won back one game in the fifth game to avoid being overthrown. The result was six to zero. Yesterday's battle between the two was mostly left and right corner shots on the baseline, so in terms of fun, it was not as good as the first day. Xu's volley kills were even less common.</p>
<p>The Doubles Match Was Full of Excitement</p>
<p>A half-hour of heavy rain, the audience hid under the shed to avoid the rain. Fortunately, the Chinese Association's stadium is "Entuka", so it can continue to fight after the rain. Xu, Ka, Lin and Peng, all four of them can serve heavy balls and have skills on the net, so the battle is very exciting in doubles. However, Xu and Ka were able to kill high in the middle of the field, and the serve was more powerful. Peng Nafei was less confident, so in the second set, Xu and Ka won again with 4-1 and 6-2. In the third set, it became 4-1 and 5-2 again. Lin and Peng chased two games in a row, and won with 6-4, three straight wins and losses.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— (Tang Zi)</p>
<p>Lack of rain causes fear of "drought", and too much rain causes fear of "flood". Some people say: "It is difficult to be heaven..." In fact, this is just the harvest of "relying on heaven for food". Today's China is still like this, which cannot but make people sigh. The country spends a lot of money every year, and the people spend a lot of money every year, but the result is like this. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>Some say that in order to achieve the goal of "women's liberation", we must first have "gender struggle". This is a huge mistake. Although "women's liberation" is mainly based on women themselves, it cannot exclude men. Under certain conditions, men still need to help each other and cooperate comprehensively.</p>

<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>Looking from afar, one sees a pile of tile roofs like a dark cloud, very orderly. Inside, there stands a flagpole seven or eight zhang tall. When the weather is clear, we can be sure to see a silver-red long flag flying at the top of the flagpole. Looking closer, one can clearly see the large characters "Ordered by the Ministry to Supervise the Collection of × Salt" written on it.</p>
<p>So here I would like to introduce a few clerks who are ordered by the Ministry to supervise the collection of × salt. One clerk is the "scale man" who weighs the salt. His face is thin, like an old gun. When the salt is being loaded, he sits high on a tall chair, using the heavily-weighted scale to weigh in bundles of slab salt. He is truly a master. He weighs the incoming salt very skillfully. For example, if 300 jin of salt are brought in and piled in the salt pan, apart from the loss due to evaporation, when it is weighed out in the future, it will still be 300 jin, or even a little more. He is greatly favored by the pan manager, but he is often cursed by the salt workers as:</p>
<p>"Short-lived, may you die a bad death, may you have no descendants!"</p>
<p>When weighing the salt, there is also a "cipher clerk" sitting next to the scale man. The cipher clerk is responsible for recording the accounts. Because the cipher clerk only needs to listen and write down the number of jin, without using much brainpower, the salary is relatively low. There are many other clerks, and their salaries are also very high. It is said that they are all in charge of accounting, but every day, besides seeing them feeding pigeons, growing flowers, and playing cards, we never see them doing anything else. Even the scale man and the cipher clerk, apart from having a little work to do when salt is being brought in, spend the rest of their time on these elegant pursuits. According to those familiar with the situation, once they take on this job, they are unlikely to leave. That is to say, it is a lifelong position. Therefore, their lives will never change. Thus, the salt pan is their place to earn a living, and also their living tomb.</p>
<h3>Shell Gathering</h3>
<p>— Zhenyan</p>
<p>Summer, on the coast, is the season when shellfish breed.</p>
<p>The people who live on the coast, some of them make a living by fishing all year round, and some of them are farmers. At that time, the fishermen's spring fishing season has come to an end, and they have all returned from the sea. The farmers have also planted rice seedlings, and only need to do some irrigation work in the fields every day. In order to supplement their living expenses, everyone has to take advantage of their spare time to do the work of gathering shellfish on the beach with their tired bodies.</p>
<p>Every time the tide recedes halfway to the sea, many people with tanned legs and wearing tattered clothes cross down to the beach from the waiting dikes, one by one. In an instant, looking out over the vast beach, there are countless people, stooping and wading through the sea mud, scattered in various mud puddles, picking up or catching shellfish. Among them are many children, and also a few beautiful girls who are almost grown up. While they are picking up shellfish, they sometimes steer mud boats, throwing mud clods at each other, playing. Sometimes they even quarrel and cry. The fiery sunlight shines on everyone's head and back, and sweat flows wildly on everyone's body. But for the sake of life, they do not avoid this abuse from the scorching sun. Therefore, they will not return to shore until the tide rises again or the baskets they carry are full.</p>
<p>Shellfish include razor clams, clams, Manila clams, sea snails, sea crabs... etc. But sea crabs often need to be caught with nets when the tide rises, immersing their bodies in the deep sea. Every day, they take the shellfish they pick up or catch to the market to sell to the dealers who buy seafood. Generally, they can exchange it for three or five jiao a day, and the children earn at most about two jiao. It can be said that it is extremely hard!</p>
<h3>The Big Family</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Respected parents, have the grace of nurturing and teaching; brothers, are like hands and feet, sharing each other's pain; husband and wife, are partners who share weal and woe, tasting sweetness and bitterness together; teachers and friends, are indispensable for learning from each other and helping each other to establish oneself in society. However, in modern society, especially in our country where the new and old ethics are not clearly distinguished, especially in the Jiangzhe area, which has the largest population and the most cultural relics, alas, it is strange to say that the respected parents, brothers, husband and wife, teachers and friends I mentioned earlier will all shake all emotions and love for the sake of one word. Why? This world is a world of money, and everyone will have many new and strange things happen for the sake of "wealth." Fathers will not be fathers, sons will not be sons, husbands and wives will not be husbands and wives, and friends will not be friends. Will this power overturn everything and knock down everything? Is it still the authority of the word "wealth"? Or should the trend be like this? Or is it because politics is not on the right track that this is the case? The author really cannot explain it.</p>
<p>Drama is to depict life, curse life, and lead life. Movies are a kind of drama. In the recent movie "The Big Family" produced by the Star Film Company, there is a very detailed, thorough, humorous, and moving depiction of the "wealth" word mentioned above. The director is Mr. Zhang Shichuan. Mr. Zhang is good at understanding the innermost layers of modern society. How is this "Big Family" performed? I don't have to promote it in advance. Fortunately, it will be released in major cinemas in this and other places. Everyone will criticize it. However, regarding the content of that script, I think it is a powerful and commendable masterpiece that prescribes the right medicine for modern society. The whole film is sound, which can further enhance the excitement of the play. Readers, wait and see!</p>
<p>World Rare News</p>
<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>European and American science is advancing by leaps and bounds, making progress a thousand miles a day. Important new inventions are increasing day by day. The brains and fingers of those inventors are truly ingenious, and one cannot help but admire them! They can make steel fingers to spin extremely fine silk for people. The fineness and smoothness are far beyond that of human fingers. Now they can also make scientific eyes, ears, noses, nerves, and muscles. The greatness of their usefulness is all above that of humans. Those eyes use electricity, the ears and noses use magnets, and the nerves and muscles are all made of metal. They can work day and night without feeling tired. They have no rest, and they don't need to take holidays. Even if they are put aside and not used, they will not cause serious unemployment problems.</p>
<p>There is a robot eye that can pick oranges. It can pick out ripe golden oranges from many unripe green oranges, which is faster and more accurate than any human eye. There is also a robot eye that guards the large furnace under the boiler in the factory day and night. It knows whether the heat is too high or too low by looking at the color of the flame, and corrects it at any time. It is also comparable to a very experienced fireman.</p>
<p>There is a company that has a robot woman who specializes in typing. It works with electricity and never stops, unlike ordinary typists who always take out a small mirror to put on makeup. There is a robot in a telegraph office that uses electricity to manage more than a hundred female workers. There is also a robot on guard duty that never slumbers and never blinks its eyes. As soon as a thief peeks into the window, it will immediately ring the alarm.</p>
<p>A university professor invented a robot that can smoke cigars, cigarettes, and pipes. Its throat and lungs are made of glass. It can inhale many puffs of smoke every minute, and the color of the smoke it inhales can be seen in the glass tube on its chest. A factory installed a large electric sign that consumes a lot of electricity every night and is unwilling to turn on until the sky is very dark. So they installed an electric eye on the roof of the factory, watching the sky and managing the current on the sign. Whether it turns on or off, there is never a mistake. Whenever there is a stormy day and the sky suddenly darkens, it will immediately turn on the electric sign.</p>
<p>In Berlin, the capital of Germany, a jewelry store sells extremely famous Zhu Zan treasures. In order to prevent thieves, it also uses a robot to guard the store. During the day, if someone peeks at the window or climbs on the window, the shadow falls on its electric eye, and an alarm will be issued. At night, if a thief shines a flashlight into the window, as soon as it sees it, it will ring the alarm bell. If the thief does not use a flashlight to break into the store, then another robot will deal with him. As long as his shadow falls on the robot's pair of invisible ultraviolet eyes, it will immediately report to the police with extraordinary speed. This kind of robot can also fire a gun or throw gas bombs, but the owner is afraid of accidental danger, so he did not install this kind of mechanism.</p>
<p>At a recent banquet, a beautiful model went on stage to show off her curves. After the performance, someone introduced her to a robot. The robot was dressed like a gentleman, and everyone called it Mr. Dai Liru. The model bowed to the robot and walked forward. The robot immediately stood up, showing a very modest appearance. The model opened her mouth and said, "How are you?" The robot also said, "How are you?" The model said, "Please sit down, please sit down." The robot replied, "Yes, sir." Then it sat down. Seeing the robot's attitude towards female guests, it is indeed gentlemanly, but it is wrong to call female guests sir. However, it treats everyone, regardless of gender or age, equally. It does not flirt with women, so it has no lover, no jealousy, and no troublesome things.</p>
<p>This robot is very capable. It can turn on the electric fan, turn off the lights, manage a vacuum cleaner, and perform other tedious tasks. It also knows numbers. If it is placed at the entrance of a cinema, it can count how many viewers there are, so that the ticket seller cannot cheat. In the factory, it can stand next to the delivery machine all day long. Packages of goods pass before its eyes, and it counts them one by one. If there are any that are different in size or the labels are not neat, it will pick them out and return them to their original place.</p>
<p>The efficiency of robots is enough to defeat manual labor. In the future, the number of unemployed people in the world is likely to increase rather than decrease. As for the recent invention by Americans of using robots to fly airplanes, which will also run rampant in the air, dropping bombs and killing enemies, that is even more amazing.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Then I realized that the Empress Dowager wanted us to see a natural wonder, which everyone would be interested in. My eyes were firmly fixed on the lotus buds, of course there were many of them, everywhere, like a fledgling bird lying in the middle of the green leaves. I had seen many buds a few days ago, and I saw them yesterday. I almost watched them grow from small to large, and now they are very plump and full of vigorous vitality.</p>
<p>The gray sky had gradually lifted, and the morning breeze and slight waves were no longer moving unconsciously. It seemed that even the two of them were quietly waiting for the appearance of that wonder. The morning light slowly penetrated and shone everywhere, and even the clothes on our bodies gradually became brighter.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but think of the early court meeting a few days ago, and the imperial edict that was issued yesterday morning. I couldn't help but steal a few glances at the Empress Dowager. From her expression at the moment, it was obvious that she had long forgotten the banished Governor of Guangdong. The influence of this incident had completely disappeared. At this moment, she was concentrating on hoping for the rising sun and the budding flowers.</p>
<p>Finally, we could see the top of the sun, which was as red as blood and as round as a plate. Everyone couldn't help but pay extra attention to it. Even the Empress Dowager herself only dared to say quietly in a whisper-like voice: "You all watch carefully!" (387)</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Don't Ask About a Daughter's Body, Difficult to Speak of Hidden Pain; Competing to See the Face of a Noble Person, Admiring the Lofty Demeanor</p>
<p>Huanhua said, it is rare that Mr. Cheng is willing to say this. Whoever follows Mr. Cheng as a concubine is also blessed. When she said this, she actually brought out some smiles from the midst of her tear-streaked face. Naturally, along with the smile, there was some blush. Zhiqian felt that this woman's appearance was a bit haggard. Moreover, she was smiling in the midst of crying, which was simply felt to be a bit miserable. Naturally, he was stunned for a while and had nothing to say. Huanhua was silent for a while and said: I am not saying good things to Mr. Cheng because I have something to ask of him. I really think that Mr. Cheng is an honest and kind elder, and I can't help but admire him. Because of this, I want to ask Mr. Cheng, and I can only say it straight out. Please forgive me whether it is right or wrong. Zhiqian looked at her face and smiled: Sure enough, if you feel that I have any power to help you, you should tell the truth, don't be so polite. Huanhua smiled bitterly on her face full of tears and said: It's not a big deal, but... I think your husband also knows, I really can't say it, because our friendship is too shallow. Zhiqian said: I understand what you mean, is it for the travel expenses? Huanhua said: Mr. Cheng is naturally a very smart person, what else can I say? To say something shameless, I can only ask Mr. Cheng to grant me grace. Zhiqian pondered for a while and said: Everyone is a guest here, you always know that this money is not easy to come by. Huanhua's slightly glowing face became a little pale. (287)</p>

<h3>Popularization of Medical Care and the Public Health System (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>In recent years, our medical community has a timely slogan called "Popularization of Medical Care." The meaning of this sentence of popularization of medical care is that medical care should not be exclusive to a few people, but should belong to the general public and be jointly owned by the entire public. Because people with assets need medical treatment and recuperation when they get sick, and poor people without assets also need medical treatment and medicine when they get sick.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a need and call for popularization of medical care among the people, and there is also promotion and promotion of popularization of medical care in the medical community.</p>
<p>This slogan of "popularization of medical care" has gradually moved from advocacy and publicity on paper to actual implementation. For example, some doctors in Shanghai set aside a time in their private clinics to do free diagnosis and treatment work. The Shanghai Medical Association has a method of member free diagnosis and treatment coupons to promote the universality of free diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of these methods is nothing more than to popularize and universalize medical care, so that the public who cannot afford to see a doctor and friends who cannot afford to pay the consultation fee can enjoy the benefits of medical care.</p>
<p>However, what is the result of this "popularization of medical care" after it is implemented? Implementation is actual implementation, but as for the results, it can only be said to be a little better than not implementing it, but it is far from the real "popularization of medical care"! The Medical Association published an advertisement to give away free medical treatment coupons, but the public who went to collect the coupons did not seem to be "crowded." The patients who consulted other private doctors who offered free treatment did not see that the number of patients during the treatment time increased much more than the patients during the consultation time. Therefore, this free treatment by a few private individuals cannot get satisfactory results; it can only be said to be a little better than not implementing it, but it cannot be called the real "popularization of medical care"!</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Does society need free treatment? No, definitely not! Society is twelve thousand points in need of free medical treatment, and the hardworking masses who are weak and sick are even more in urgent need of medicine to relieve their pain! However, there are several factual reasons why free treatment cannot be universal.</p>
<p>The first reason is the patient's knowledge. This sentence does not mean that you must have certain knowledge to go to the doctor to diagnose and treat the problem, but at least you must first understand the free treatment itself. However, to understand the matter of free treatment, it is invisibly limited to the public who have a minimum level of superficial knowledge. For example, among the public who cannot afford to see a doctor, there are unemployed intellectuals, small businessmen and small clerks, rickshaw pullers, cleaning maids, and workers who work in the factory all day long. However, among the public in these various industries, the more uneducated and hardworking the public is, the more difficult it is to understand the matter of free medical treatment. For example, the free medical treatment coupon advertisement of the Medical Association is published in the newspaper. Many of these lower-level people have no chance to read the newspaper, and are unable to read the newspaper. How can they be informed and how can they be told? Even other people who can read the newspaper may not pay attention to it, or they may still hold a skeptical attitude and treat it the same as the slippery advertisements of ordinary quack doctors, and treat it as an attractive advertisement to attract customers, which is also possible.</p>
<p>The second reason is the concept of free treatment for the general public, especially for some intellectuals. They know that free treatment does not require a consultation fee, but they always think that the doctor's free treatment is careless. In fact, it is not entirely true! Among doctors, there are many who are snobbish, but it cannot be said that there are absolutely no kind and benevolent ones. But again, under the current society, doctors cannot put all their time on free treatment work for the sake of life. In other words, most of their time must be spent on general outpatient patients in order to get paid and survive. Otherwise, the doctor himself cannot live, and it is impossible to serve without food. It is already a great effort for a doctor to set aside some time in his routine consultation time to do free treatment! It is absolutely impossible for him to use all his strength to do treatment work. This is not the doctor's fault, but the current social system makes it so. Therefore, the general public's concept of free treatment, especially free treatment in private clinics, is always different from ordinary outpatient treatment. They always think that it is not as fine as ordinary outpatient treatment, and always think that it is careless. Part of it is due to the patient's excessive consideration, but the objective fact is that doctors cannot use all their strength to do treatment work. The current social system does not allow doctors who are willing to sacrifice and do public work to carry out the real task of popularizing medical care, which is also a fact. This is also a reason why free treatment cannot have good results.</p>
<p>The third reason is still the patient's economic problem. This sentence seems incomprehensible at first glance: Since the treatment is free, why is there still an economic problem? In fact, after thinking carefully, it is a fact. Free treatment only means that the doctor does not charge a consultation fee for seeing a doctor; after seeing a doctor, taking medicine and injections still require money. The doctor has fulfilled his obligations by providing treatment, and it is enough. It is too much to ask them to take out money to give away needles and medicine, and it is impossible in fact. Patients who get prescriptions cannot help but go to the pharmacy to fill the medicine. An ordinary prescription costs at least half a dollar or a dollar. For the truly poor masses, this amount of half a dollar or a dollar is also impossible to afford. If you need an injection, it will cost more, and it will be even more difficult for the poor and sick masses to find a way. Therefore, free treatment seems very good on the surface. It is to facilitate the public who cannot afford medical treatment and solve their medical treatment problems. In fact, it still requires a public with a minimum of economic ability (or can only be said to be a small number of people) to be able to enjoy it. As for the true popularization and universality, it cannot skip this economic barrier to achieve the ideal goal of "popularization of medical care."</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(63) Ascites</p>
<p>(Q) What is ascites?</p>
<p>(A) This is a disease in which the water in the body accumulates in the abdominal cavity, commonly known as tympanites.</p>
<p>(Q) How do people get ascites?</p>
<p>(A) There are only three reasons for the occurrence of ascites: (1) Congestion, such as when there is a systemic blood circulation disorder in heart and lung diseases, or when the portal vein is congested in liver diseases.</p>
<p>(2) During nephritis. (3) Anemia and cachexia, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the nature of the water accumulated in the abdominal cavity?</p>
<p>(A) This kind of ascites is a yellow transparent liquid, containing 1% to 3% protein, and a specific gravity of 1.012. Sometimes it is bloody, sometimes it is chylous, and sometimes it is fatty.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of a patient with ascites?</p>
<p>(A) If the accumulation of ascites is not more than one and a half liters, he feels that it cannot be proven. Because most of it remains in the pelvic cavity, it is necessary to raise the patient's sacral part and make him take the knee-elbow position to check. When the accumulation is large, the abdomen is distended, and in the supine position, the front becomes flat and expands to the sides, like the abdomen of a frog. When standing, the lower abdomen is very distended, and the navel fossa disappears or protrudes in the shape of an umbilical hernia (see picture). The abdomen is tense and shiny, and the skin is sometimes so distended that it cracks. In the future, after the disease is cured, there will be many patterns left, like a multiparous woman.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the sound when percussing the abdomen?</p>
<p>(A) The ascites area is dull, with fluctuations, and changes with body position.</p>
<p>(Q) What appears on the surface of the abdominal skin?</p>
<p>(A) In severe ascites, the subcutaneous veins are dilated, like snakes.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the heartbeat and breathing?</p>
<p>(A) Because the diaphragm is raised after water accumulates in the abdominal cavity, palpitations are increased and breathing is difficult.</p>
<p>(Q) How to diagnose ascites?</p>
<p>(A) As long as the abdomen is distended, fluctuating, and the percussion sound changes with the change of body position, and the cause in the past is investigated, the diagnosis can be made.</p>
<p>(Q) What diseases should ascites be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(A) It should be distinguished from peritonitis, ovarian cysts, kidney hydrops, pregnant uterus, and bladder fullness.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Most are bad.</p>
<p>(Q) How to treat ascites?</p>
<p>(A) First, etiology therapy must be performed, and the primary disease that caused the disease must be found and treated. Second, symptomatic treatment is performed, that is, diuretics and purgatives are given to drain the water, or cardiotonics and diaphoretics can also be used. Avoid foods with too much water and eat dry foods. When the amount of ascites is very large, puncture can be performed to drain the accumulated water. (End)</p>
<h3>Medical Knowledge for Pain Relief (27)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Scarlet Fever Sore Throat: Patients in the early stages of scarlet fever also experience sore throats. The sore throat is caused by inflammation of the tonsils and throat. This type of sore throat is one of the symptoms of scarlet fever. Treatment should target the scarlet fever as the main goal, and it is not advisable to focus solely on the sore throat and ignore the scarlet fever.</p>
<p>Vincent's Angina Sore Throat: This sore throat is similar to diphtheria. This inflammation often occurs in the throat and mouth. The inflammation is caused by Vincent's fusiform bacteria and spirochetes. In addition to gargling with a mild disinfectant solution, the most effective treatment is to sprinkle Neo-Salvarsan powder on the affected area.</p>
<p>Syphilitic Sore Throat: Patients with syphilis in the late initial stage and the middle of the secondary stage often experience sore throats. This is a relatively mild sore throat, similar to chronic tonsillitis or chronic laryngitis. This type of sore throat cannot be effectively treated with any oral medication or gargling solution. To treat this type of sore throat, do not worry about the sore throat itself, but pay attention to injecting syphilis-specific medications.</p>
<p>Ear Pain</p>
<p>There are several types of ear pain, and the severity varies depending on the location. To distinguish between different types of ear pain, it is necessary to understand the structure of the ear. The following is a brief description of the structure of the ear as a foundation for studying ear pain.</p>
<p>The ear is divided into three parts: (1) Outer Ear. What we focus on is the area from the opening of the external auditory canal to the eardrum. This membrane, also known as the tympanic membrane, is the septum between the external auditory canal and the middle ear. (2) Middle Ear. Located inside the eardrum and outside the inner ear, it is a cavity in the bone with several small holes communicating with the inner ear. There is a tunnel-like Eustachian tube connecting the middle ear to the nasopharyngeal cavity, so problems in the nose can affect the middle ear, and bacteria can sometimes enter the middle ear through this tube. The middle ear communicates upward and backward to the epitympanic recess, and then from the epitympanic recess backward to the mastoid air cells. These air cells, also called sinuses, are located within the raised mastoid bone behind the ear. The air cells are composed of numerous small bone cavities. The mastoid air cells have thick bone on the outside and are separated from the brain by only a paper-thin layer of bone on the inside. Therefore, when inflammation occurs in the mastoid air cells, this thin bone is very easily destroyed, allowing pus and bacteria to invade the brain. Once bacteria invade the brain, it becomes a fatal condition. (3) Inner Ear. This is where the nerve senses for hearing and body balance are located, separated from the brain by a layer of bone.</p>
<p>External Otitis: The most common problem occurring in the external auditory canal is furuncles (small abscesses). Swelling is often very painful. The reason is that the external auditory canal is a small bone tunnel wrapped in a layer of skin, and there is no room for expansion when swelling occurs. Therefore, the nature of the pain is distension pain. The cause of ear furuncles is often scratching with fingernails or picking by barbers. Treatment should follow these two principles: First, before pus forms, instill glycerinated carbolic acid into the external auditory canal. Carbolic acid can numb the nerve sensory organs in the inflamed area, thus reducing pain. Second, once a furuncle forms pus, it should be cut with a small incision to release the pus. After the pus is released, the tension is relieved, and the pain can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Otitis Media: The biggest cause of otitis media is bacteria invading the middle ear from the nasal cavity through the Eustachian tube. Otitis media often starts as an acute condition, and it is most common in children. Sometimes, if children cry, fuss, and have a slight fever, but there are no other obvious symptoms, attention should be paid to otitis media. The danger of otitis media is that it can reach the brain from the mastoid air cells and become a deep-seated infection. Therefore, when treating otitis media, attention should also be paid to its severity and the prevention of brain abscesses. What can reduce pain during the inflammation period is using hot and cold compresses several times a day. The most important method to avoid direct brain infection is to cut the eardrum as soon as pus forms in the middle ear, so that the pus flows outward instead of inward.</p>
<p>Mastoiditis: Sometimes, following otitis media, patients feel pain deep behind the ear. The muscles on the mastoid bone also swell. Pressing the mastoid bone causes unbearable pain within the bone. The body may also have a slight fever. An X-ray can reveal pus shadows within the mastoid air cells. Once mastoiditis is confirmed, it should be surgically treated immediately to allow the pus within the bone air cells to flow out through the incision, avoiding inward flow and causing a major disaster.</p>
<p>Eye Pain</p>
<p>Serious eye problems should be treated by a real ophthalmologist. However, it is beneficial for patients to have some common sense. Described here are several important types of eye pain, briefly outlining the various symptoms and treatment guidelines. If patients are vague and confused and seek treatment from a vague and confused doctor, not only will the eye pain not be cured, but losing one's sight is also not difficult.</p>
<p>Gonorrheal Conjunctivitis: This type of conjunctivitis is very serious. The patient's entire eye is swollen, red, and painful. Gonorrheal diplococci can be found in the pus discharged. The patient is infected by bringing their own gonorrhea bacteria into the eye by hand, or by wiping someone else's gonorrhea bacteria into the eye with an unclean towel. This type of conjunctivitis should not be treated as ordinary conjunctivitis. If it is treated as ordinary conjunctivitis, the patient can easily become blind. Treating this eye disease is not just about solving the eye pain problem, so patients should consult a reliable ophthalmologist for diagnosis and treatment, and follow their instructions to avoid blindness.</p>
<p>Iritis: The iris, also known as the pupillary diaphragm, is a circular membrane surrounding the pupil that can contract and expand. Contraction dilates the pupil, while expansion constricts the pupil. When the iris is inflamed, the red part is around the black eyeball, and the red lines are radial. The patient feels eye pain, and the pain is in the eyeball, and it also reflects pain to the forehead and temples. The pain is often more severe at night than during the day. The most common cause of iritis is syphilis. This shows that syphilis is capable of anything bad inside the body. The next most common cause is rheumatism. There are also some causes that are not easy to know without specialized research.</p>
<p>If the eye pain is found to be due to syphilis, in addition to local treatment for the eye, general treatment for syphilis should be adopted. If syphilis is not cured, this eye disease will not get better. If rheumatism is the source of the disease, rheumatism must be treated fundamentally. If it is due to other causes, treatment should also be based on the pathology. As for local treatment methods, the most important is to use atropine to dilate the pupil and allow the iris to rest. Detailed treatment methods should be guided by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Panophthalmitis: Sometimes the entire eyeball becomes inflamed and completely suppurates. The eyeball is very painful, and headaches, chills, and fever also occur. Most patients lose their sight and sometimes develop meningitis. Patients must seek expert diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Glaucoma is a disease in which the pressure inside the eye is particularly increased. The disease is divided into several stages, ultimately leading to blindness in both eyes. When glaucoma occurs, the patient feels very severe eye pain and headaches. Vision gradually becomes blurred, the visual field gradually shrinks, and the pupil has a steamy, slightly bluish color, hence the name glaucoma. This is a very dangerous disease, and patients must not delay treatment. The principle of treatment is to reduce the pressure inside the eyeball. This goal can be achieved by surgical methods or medication methods, guided by experts to reverse blindness, which is not too difficult.</p>
<p>Acute Lymphadenitis</p>
<p>The entire body is covered with fine lymphatic vessels, and many fine vessels merge to form larger vessels. Some of the vessels have lymph nodes in the middle. The function of the nodes is similar to that of filters. Lymphatic vessels absorb tissue fluid from the body and transfer it into the blood. When fluid passes through the lymph nodes, bacteria inside are often retained by the lymph nodes. Therefore, lymph nodes are the body's first line of defense. If there were no lymph nodes, bacteria could enter the heart directly from a break in the skin along with the lymphatic fluid, and reach any part of the body through the bloodstream. The nature of lymph nodes is also similar to that of public security bureaus in various places. Sometimes the toxins of bacteria are very strong, and once they invade the lymph nodes, they cause a serious reaction, i.e., acute lymphadenitis.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the lymph nodes in the neck as an example. For example, when there is inflammation on the face, the lymph nodes in the neck will swell and become painful. Sores on the face can also have the same result. Rotten teeth or a rotten gums in the mouth also often cause acute inflammation of the lymph nodes under the lower jawbone. The acute inflammation starts with redness, swelling, and unbearable pain. After one or two weeks, the inflamed nodes may suppurate or resolve on their own.</p>
<p>The function of lymph nodes in other parts of the body is the same. For example, when a finger is swollen and rotten, the lymph nodes under the armpit often become inflamed and suppurate. When the legs or feet are swollen and rotten, the lymph nodes on the inner side of the upper thighs also swell and suppurate. When soft chancres or gonorrhea occur on the genitals, the lymph nodes where the groin meets the abdomen often swell, ulcerate, and form buboes. – Non-ulcerating buboes are called "hengxuan," and ulcerating ones are commonly called "fish mouth" (note that syphilitic hengxuan is often more mild).</p>
<p>Here, we can also talk about lymphangitis. Lymphangitis is mostly acute, and its inflammation is caused by bacteria from skin and muscle inflammation invading along the lymphatic vessels. The symptoms of lymphangitis are red lines on the affected area, most commonly on the arms and legs, and chills and fever also occur. Lymphangitis is often the fuse for lymphadenitis.</p>
<p>Treating lymphadenitis with hot and cold compresses is quite beneficial for relieving pain and reducing swelling. Once the inflamed lymph nodes suppurate, they should be cut open to release the pus. If lymphadenitis occurs on the inner side of the upper thigh, the best way to relieve pain and reduce swelling is to rest quietly in bed for several days. Doing so can generally eliminate the problem without a trace. As for hengxuan and "fish mouth," in addition to general treatment, specialized treatment should be adopted.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Ears, Nose, Throat, and Eyes</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(59) Laryngeal Syphilis</p>
<p>Everyone knows about syphilis. Clinically, it can be divided into the primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. In the secondary and tertiary stages, it invades the internal organs. What we are talking about now, laryngeal syphilis, occurs in the secondary and tertiary stages. It is rarely seen in the primary stage.</p>
<p>Various symptoms of laryngeal syphilis occurring in the secondary stage include syphilitic laryngitis, leukoplakia, flat condyloma, and secondary ulcers, etc. These will be described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Syphilitic Laryngitis: This type of laryngitis occurs six to twelve weeks, or even a few more days, after syphilis infection. This type of laryngitis is difficult to distinguish from simple laryngitis, so patients often only know that it is laryngitis and do not know that it comes from syphilis. In the epiglottis area, there are often roseola-like spots. The mucous membrane is generally flushed, but it is not simply red, but slightly dark red or purplish-red. Surface exfoliation often occurs. The head lymph nodes show a specific swelling. The voice is mostly hoarse.</p>
<p>(2) Leukoplakia: Leukoplakia is a characteristic symptom of the secondary stage of syphilis, so white spots often appear on the reddened mucous membrane of laryngeal syphilis. This type of leukoplakia is fond of occurring on the vocal cords, epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and posterior wall. Its shape is quite different, with round shapes and irregular shapes.</p>
<p>(3) Flat Condyloma: Flat condyloma is also a characteristic symptom in the secondary stage of syphilis, but it is relatively rare in laryngeal syphilis. If flat condyloma occurs, it shows a flat raised surface that is uneven and grayish-white or light red. Sometimes superficial ulcers occur. The base of the ulcer often has dirty yellow pus-like material covering it, and there are papilla-like red spots protruding.</p>
<p>Laryngeal syphilis in the tertiary stage of syphilis also manifests as gummas. It usually occurs five to ten years after syphilis infection. Initially, it is mostly a localized hemispherical bulge, with varying sizes, small ones like millet grains and large ones like hazelnuts. The surface is smooth and appears dark red. It is quite hard. The surrounding mucous membrane shows inflammatory swelling. This bulge can be isolated or multiple. It can occur anywhere in the larynx, especially on the epiglottis. This type of gumma can be destroyed to form an ulcer after a short period of time. The ulcer is mostly deep-seated. The edges of the ulcer are mostly sharp. The surrounding area appears dark red and swollen. The base of the ulcer is covered with dirty, lard-like material.</p>
<p>Speaking of the symptoms of laryngeal syphilis, during the period of inflammation, hoarseness often occurs. When flat condyloma occurs in the epiglottis area, there is mild difficulty in swallowing. Once gummas occur, symptoms such as hoarseness, loss of voice, and difficulty in swallowing occur. During the period when it is destroyed to form an ulcer, unclean purulent secretions or blood-mixed pus are coughed up, and the breath emits a foul odor.</p>
<p>The treatment of laryngeal syphilis is the same as the general treatment of syphilis. It is best to rigorously implement anti-syphilitic treatment while seeking local treatment from a specialist physician.</p>
<h3>Popular Lectures on Modern Venereology (13)</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengbai (compiler), Yin Muqiang (corrector)</p>
<p>Part 2: Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Chapter 6: On the Problem of Treating Gonorrhea</p>
<p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that the cure of gonorrhea is most convenient and certain in the early stages. Therefore, those who have gonorrhea should have this concept. If one knows that there is a suspicion of having contracted gonorrhea (such as a history of frequenting prostitutes, or urethral secretions and mild inflammation), it is necessary to seek treatment from a specialist physician immediately.</p>
<p>If, based on existing symptoms and microscopic examination of the pus secretions, a doctor has diagnosed gonorrhea, then one should absolutely abide by the doctor's instructions in order to be cured quickly. The following are the rules that general gonorrhea patients should follow, as well as some things to pay attention to during treatment, which I will continue to explain to readers.</p>
<p>1. Regimen</p>
<p>A. Removing the Harmful Causes and Preventing Congestion of the Bony Pelvis: Congestion, especially of the genitals, must be avoided as much as possible, as it promotes the development of the disease. Therefore, those who have gonorrhea should limit exercise, such as riding horses, riding cars, gymnastics, marching, traveling, and long-distance walks. In addition, regular bowel movements can also prevent the progression of inflammation.</p>
<p>Excessive exercise not only causes congestion of the genitals, but also often results in excessive sweating, which reduces the amount of urine. In this way, thick pus cannot be diluted by urine, and floating bacteria cannot be washed away by the action of urine, causing painful urination and further increasing the proliferation of gonorrhea bacteria.</p>
<p>B. Relationship with Diet and Drinks: Alcohol and irritating drinks not only directly irritate the urethra, but also cause excitement, which interferes with sleep and triggers erections, indirectly making the course of the disease worse. Therefore, they should be absolutely prohibited. As for the intake of more non-irritating drinks, it can indeed increase the amount of urine, washing away secretions in the urethra and having a good effect.</p>
<p>C. Avoiding Intercourse and Erections: Intercourse while having gonorrhea not only increases the severity of the disease but also carries the risk of infecting others, so it should be absolutely prohibited. Other things such as lewd novels, conversations, photographs, and movies should also be avoided. As for erections, they often occur naturally as a result of inflammation during the illness (especially in the acute phase). At this time, the patient often experiences pain that interferes with sleep, further causing congestion and swelling of the genitals, which increases inflammation and helps the gonorrhea bacteria invade internally. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with this pathological erection. Applying cold compresses locally, administering sedatives, and wearing light clothing are all effective methods.</p>
<p>D. Paying Attention to the Use of a Suspensory: Using a suspensory to keep the penis still and protect the posterior urethra and testicles is a good method, but one should pay attention to keeping the penis relaxed and not compressed.</p>
<p>2. Oral Medications</p>
<p>Oral medications have limited direct bactericidal effects. They only reduce secretions, eliminate inflammation, relieve pain, and alleviate acute symptoms. Therefore, they can be used as a wait-and-see therapy and auxiliary therapy in the acute or subacute phase. Here are a few things to pay attention to when using oral medications:</p>
<p>A. Sandalwood Oil is a Historically Famous Treatment for Gonorrhea. At this time, one should pay attention to (1) those with stomach problems may experience belching, reduced appetite, and even acute gastritis; (2) those with kidney problems may be stimulated and develop proteinuria, so it should not be used indiscriminately. Most of the commercially available pills for white discharge mainly contain this ingredient. Those who take this should be cautious.</p>
<p>B. Urethral Disinfectants: Wrotropin and Salol are commonly used products in this category. However, they may also irritate the mucous membrane in the most acute phase, so they should be avoided for those with sensitive mucous membranes and those with obvious symptoms of inflammation.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (63)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 7: Other Complications</p>
<p>(1) Amyloid Degeneration of Abdominal Organs. Among the abdominal organs, the spleen, liver, kidney, intestines, etc., can all develop amyloid degeneration. Approximately four-fifths of its occurrence is due to tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis alone accounts for two-thirds of the cases, especially the chronic cavitary type. Regarding its clinical symptoms, they are generally not very obvious, especially in the liver and spleen. It can be said that, apart from organ enlargement and a smooth, hard feel upon touch, there are no other symptoms. In renal amyloid degeneration, protein is found in the urine, and the amount of protein is sometimes very high. In intestinal amyloid degeneration, diarrhea occurs, even uncontrollably, which is called "collapsing diarrhea." Patients often die from it. Abdominal distension is sometimes very similar to intestinal tuberculosis. - Amyloid degeneration has a very poor prognosis; improvement in the condition is impossible, and even examples that can be prolonged for two or three years are very rare. Treatment is symptomatic.</p>
<p>(2) Neuritis. Acute and subacute neuritis is also sometimes seen in pulmonary tuberculosis. It is sometimes solitary, but multiple neuritis can also occur simultaneously. Its cause is probably related to poisoning, because tubercle bacilli can often be found in the nerves. This type of neuritis is particularly stubborn, but the prognosis is mostly good.</p>
<p>(3) Tuberculous Rheumatism. This is not a fully confirmed term. Its explanation and the proposal of the original name are due to Poncet. It is a rheumatic-like joint disease with symptoms of swelling and severe pain. The joint parts that occur are mostly the wrist, knee, and shoulder joints. Its clinical symptoms are similar to ordinary rheumatism. However, the effect of salicylate (the specific agent for acute rheumatism) is not as great, and the new occurrence of endocarditis is also very rare. Tubercle bacilli can sometimes be found in the blood. In addition to the treatment of tuberculosis itself, the treatment is roughly the same as that of rheumatism.</p>
<p>Section 8: The Combination of Tuberculosis with Other Diseases</p>
<p>Tuberculosis can sometimes progress in conjunction with several common diseases, such as syphilis, diabetes, and malaria. The impact of this combination, whether good or bad, and the areas that should be paid special attention to in treatment, are also necessary to know. Now, let's describe them one by one below:</p>
<p>(1) Tuberculosis and Syphilis. The combination of these two diseases is relatively common. There are many factual examples of children with congenital syphilis also suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, but there is no very accurate diagnosis. If tuberculosis occurs in a newly diagnosed syphilis patient, then this type of tuberculosis mostly belongs to the extremely progressive type. Whether syphilis patients are more likely to develop tuberculosis is a question that has not yet been fully resolved. If a patient with tertiary syphilis has tuberculosis, then whether this course is bad is also uncertain. The treatment of syphilis is also very noteworthy. The use of mercury is very inappropriate for tuberculosis, but bismuth treatment has no adverse effects. Salvarsan also has no major relationship, but the dosage needs to be considered slightly. Iodine preparations are also often used in tuberculosis, so there is even less need to avoid them!</p>
<p>(2) Tuberculosis and Diabetes. The occurrence of diabetes during the course of tuberculosis is unlikely. Conversely, if diabetes already exists, then it is relatively easy to develop. The combination of these two diseases has a worse prognosis. We know that the treatment principle for diabetes is to pay special attention to dietary restrictions, especially reducing carbohydrate-containing foods to the minimum possible amount. Protein should also be restricted sometimes. Tuberculosis is very concerned about nutritional status and is inclusive, even sometimes inferring its prognosis based on appetite. Under this condition, for the physician to implement an appropriate treatment plan, isn't it like being "a daughter-in-law caught between two mothers-in-law?"</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Retrospective on the Ningbo Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>1.  A General Overview of the Ningbo Financial Market</p>
<p>There are three major financial centers in Zhejiang: Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. Shaoxing is a production area, while Ningbo and Hangzhou are more akin to commercial districts. Especially before Shanghai was opened as a treaty port, Hangzhou and Ningbo held important positions in international and domestic commerce. Comparing Hangzhou and Ningbo, Hangzhou is more like a metropolis, while Ningbo is a purely commercial center.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, Ningbo had the Office of Merchant Shipping (市舶司), managing the entry and exit of domestic and foreign merchant ships. At that time, Ningbo enjoyed considerable convenience in both water and land transportation.</p>
<p>The modern Ningbo financial market is undeniably developed, with both banks and native banks (錢莊). The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Siming Bank all have offices or branches in Ningbo. However, the focus is on the native banks. Ningbo's native banks have a special financial system, known as the "clearing system" (過帳制), which everyone knows.</p>
<p>What is clearing? Clearing means exchanging accounts. In general, most of the transactions in the Ningbo market are based on clearing. These clearing funds can only be used as a standard for mutual offsetting or bookkeeping. If cash is required, it must be calculated separately. For example, if Merchant A receives a clearing note from Native Bank B, Merchant A can deliver it to any financial institution to collect the money, but if they want Native Bank B to pay cash, they must pay a premium. This premium is commonly called "cash uplift" (現升), and its level depends on the supply of silver dollars.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two market prices for goods in Ningbo: clearing and cash. If you go to the market to buy goods and pay in cash, the store will definitely return a considerable premium to you, because their prices are based on clearing dollars.</p>
<p>As for the clearing method of each native bank, for example, if Native Bank A should receive 1,000 yuan from Native Bank B, Native Bank A's correspondent bank is Bank A, and Native Bank B's is Bank B. After the two parties have a verbal agreement, they each notify their correspondent banks. Banks A and B each record the amount receivable or payable in the clearing ledger, exchange ledgers with each other, and verify them. If they match, the clearing procedure is completed. At night, the Native Bankers Association will settle the clearing funds receivable and payable by each bank. Therefore, the clearing system is actually a prototype of a clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Because Ningbo is a clearing financial market, all payments are made through clearing, so the use of cash is not extensive. As for the vast use of clearing dollars, its position is actually above the Shanghai exchange dollars (匯劃洋).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to study the causes and effects of this financial crisis. Therefore, the description of the clearing system is only a brief one. Fortunately, scholars have already published very detailed research books, and the Ningbo Native Bankers Association also has a "Clearing Guidelines" (過帳須知) for outsiders to refer to.</p>
<p>2.  The Course of the Crisis and Analysis of the Causes</p>
<p>The fuse of the Ningbo crisis was also due to the financial panic in Shanghai. In June and July, several small native banks had already closed down. On July 30, after the collapse of the Yuan Yu Bank in Hankou, some native bank shareholders were related to the former, so a run on deposits began. However, because the event was unexpected, most of the funds absorbed by the banks had been converted into loans, so they could not circulate and could not cope, so they had to declare closure. However, the shareholders or related persons of the native banks had joint and several liability, or because of miscommunication of the name, on July 30, the Tai Sheng, Yan Yuan, and Xin Yuan also closed, and the Tai Yuan, Yong Yuan, and Wu Yuan declared liquidation. Afterwards, there were continued bank runs and bankruptcies. Of the original 37 major native banks in the city, only two-thirds remained.</p>
<p>The causes of this crisis can be divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) Erosion of the Credit System: The clearing system and clearing dollars are nothing more than credit. When people's minds are stable, the trust in bills is strong, so there is no need to go through the procedure of exchanging cash, and it can be circulated. This circulation replaces a considerable amount of cash. Especially because of the premium relationship between clearing dollars and cash, a layer of restriction is added to the need for cash. For the convenience of procedures and the discount of interest, the general business community is naturally willing to use clearing dollars. The effectiveness of cash is instead on the side of space. Because the business community credits clearing dollars, the inflow and outflow of funds are only within the native bank group that clears accounts, so the power of the native banks is even stronger. This time, due to the erosion of the entire credit system, not only did they not trust the native banks, but also did not trust clearing dollars, which evolved into a trend of capital flight. Therefore, the scope of its fluctuation is the entire native bank industry, and the crisis it has created is not just in one corner.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Cash Reserves: Based on the above, Ningbo has a clearing financial system, and the application of cash is not extensive, so the amount of cash reserves at ordinary times is not large. Most of the deposits absorbed are small deposits, close to savings deposits, so the expenditure is not large. Ningbo's native banks are extremely developed, but Ningbo's commerce does not seem to be progressing much, so the funds absorbed have to be transferred to other ports, and not much is left. With all these things, once the credit system is eroded, the huge amount of funds that have been loaned out are mostly fixed-term and cannot be recovered for a while; and the depositors who do not withdraw at ordinary times have to withdraw cash all at once, so they have to declare closure.</p>
<p>(3) Organizational Shortcomings: The organizational shortcoming is that the native banks and shareholders did not check carefully at ordinary times. The cause of this crisis was that the erosion of the shareholders' credit affected the related banks, and many innocent people were implicated. Therefore, the various native banks are too uncoordinated with the shareholders, and the shareholders are too uncoordinated with the native banks. Because the native bank is a partnership organization, the native bank should know the ability of the shareholders, and the shareholders should also understand their own ability. If the shareholders know that they cannot bear the responsibilities they should bear, they should get rid of the name of the shareholders as soon as possible, and the native bank should do the same to the shareholders. We must know that financial institutions are one of the components of the financial system and cannot be separated and independent. The impact they receive will definitely not stop at themselves. If they can understand this meaning at ordinary times, then the hasty actions in the face of change can be avoided.</p>
<p>(4) Lack of Agility in Coping Methods: When it comes to coping methods, it seems that it is only on the one hand of negotiating bids. For example, the act of restricting withdrawals to no more than 100 yuan from the six measures only deepens the degree of panic in people's minds. Also, hoping that the banks will not accept clearing deposits does not seem to have any effect. Because this restriction only increases the tendency for funds to escape the port. The most appropriate method should focus on the coordination of financial institutions and the strengthening of credit and cash reserves. When the crisis first started, if the native banks themselves could strengthen their strength earlier, and the government could eliminate the panic of runs earlier, then the scope of the panic would definitely not have expanded like this.</p>
<p>III. Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the financial market in Ningbo was originally a deformed development. Because Ningbo is an over-spending port in terms of commerce, relying on the remittances of people living abroad to make up for it. The funds absorbed by Ningbo's financial institutions are not used for the development of Ningbo's industry and commerce, but instead flow to the outside, which is a miscalculation.</p>
<p>In recent years, as a result of the extreme decline of the rural areas, the general purchasing power has also been declining, so the exhaustion of the financial situation is naturally an ideal thing. Here, we cannot ignore the possibility of panic that can occur at any time in small cities in general.</p>
<p>This Ningbo financial crisis did not have much impact on the financial markets in various places. Some people think that if a panic occurs in Ningbo, the funds deposited in foreign ports everywhere must be recovered; in fact, for Ningbo, this deposit is indeed a huge loan, but scattered to various ports, it is only a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>What we hope for Ningbo's financial institutions in the future is that they should consolidate their own credit organizations, and at the same time, they should not ignore the linkage between the financial industry and local industries. August 8th</p>
<p>II. Tang</p>
<p>The course of this Ningbo native bank crisis, after a little整理from various sources, can also be used as a reference, and I will summarize it below.</p>
<p>The crisis occurred on July 30 and temporarily came to an end on August 3. The native banks that collapsed and ran aground in five days are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Major Native Banks: Xin Yuan, Yan Yuan, Yong Yuan, and Tai Yuan, also ran aground on July 30. Tai Sheng Bank, cleared on July 31. Yu Feng, Jing Yuan, Hui Yuan, Yu Yuan, and Tai Han, ran aground on August 2. Yuan Kang Bank, temporarily suspended business on August 3. A total of eleven banks ran aground in five days; the total capital was 711,000 yuan, and the total turnover was about 6 million yuan. The turnover of Tai Yuan, Tai Sheng, Hui Yuan, and Tai Han is unknown, but if the turnover of these four banks is added, it should be more than 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Minor Native Banks: Wu Yuan Bank, cleared on July 30, Heng Mao and Wei Kang, ran aground on August 1; Tai Yi, Yuan Cheng, Cheng Yuan, Bao He, Feng Da, Bao Yuan, and Bao Xing, ran aground on August 2; Heng Yu Bank, temporarily suspended business on August 3, a total of eleven banks, the total capital was 400,800 yuan, and the total turnover was about 5.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Cash Exchange Shops: Hui Da, cleared on July 31; Xing Yuan and Yan Kang, ran aground on August 1; Tong Chun, ran aground on August 2. A total of four shops, the total capital was 28,000 yuan, the turnover of Hui Da, Xing Yuan, and Yan Kang is unknown, but the total turnover was more than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Statistically, there are twenty-six major and minor native banks and cash exchange shops that have been affected by the crisis. The capital and total turnover of each shop are listed below. (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>

<p>(Note) The total turnover of each shop is approximate.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Crisis</p>
<p>Ningbo's native banks have always been very stable. Even if accidents occur occasionally, they can safely overcome the difficulties. During the Shanghai January 28 Incident, Ningbo was seriously affected because it was adjacent to Shanghai, but it was able to avoid a crisis, which can also be used as proof of its stability. However, in recent years, the economic downturn has become increasingly profound, causing an unprecedented crisis for stable native banks. On July 31, the county government considered the native bank industry to be the leader of industry and commerce. The bankruptcy of seven banks in two days had a significant impact on the social finance. A telegram was sent to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, properly planning specific measures for the aftermath. At the same time, a notice was issued that, starting from that day, deposits and withdrawals by checking accounts, regardless of the amount, would be processed as usual; withdrawals of cash would be temporarily limited to 100 yuan, to show restriction. On August 2, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce convened representatives of the silver and money industry for an emergency meeting, and six measures were agreed upon on the spot: (1) The public bills of each bank shall not exceed 150,000 yuan. If those passing in on the same day exceed 150,000 yuan, the excess shall be split by the same industry, and the same industry shall be jointly responsible. (2) Starting from now on, the amount of deposits withdrawn by depositors shall not exceed 100 yuan per household per day. The county government has already issued a notice, and all banks should jointly comply. (3) If a member of the Native Bankers Association believes that a certain bank has too many outstanding bills, they may investigate the number of its split bills at any time, and when necessary, they may order it to advance capital. (4) Please ask the banks in this port to temporarily not accept deposits by clearing accounts. (5) Send a letter to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, jointly borrowing 2 million yuan in national currency to provide relief. (6) The banks that have been closed should resume business immediately, and checking accounts should be processed as usual; and the details of receipts and payments should be copied and sent to the Chamber of Commerce for review and forwarded to the county government for verification. On the one hand, the shareholders tried their best to increase their capital, and on the other hand, the depositors' funds were temporarily postponed for withdrawal. The next day, the Native Bankers Association also held a meeting and passed the six measures agreed upon by the Chamber of Commerce. On the 4th, the eleven major native banks resumed business, and the eleven minor native banks and four cash exchange shops were also rectifying their internal affairs and revitalizing their operations, and the unprecedented crisis came to an end.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Shanghai Silver Reserves in the Last Six Months</h3>
<p>— Leng Bo</p>
<p>We will go further and study the movement of Shanghai's silver reserves, and the details of the movement are shown in the following table (unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>According to the above table, from the end of last year to the end of June this year, Shanghai's silver imports were 15,420,000 yuan, and exports were 20,010,000 yuan. After offsetting the two, the trade surplus was 4,590,000 yuan. On the import side, 7,640,000 yuan were imported from foreign countries, and 7,780,000 yuan were transported from domestic ports. On the export side, 850,000 yuan were exported to foreign countries, 9,610,000 yuan were transported to coastal ports, and 9,550,000 yuan were transported to inland ports. What we should pay special attention to here is that on the import side, imports from foreign countries account for almost half of the total imports, while on the export side, exports to foreign countries account for only 4% of the total exports. Compared with the actual number of the two, there is still a trade surplus of 6,790,000 yuan from foreign countries. This phenomenon seems very gratifying at first glance. Now that the US silver policy is in progress, and Shanghai's silver imports and exports have actually had a trade surplus, doesn't this mean that the US silver policy has not harmed China? In fact, it is not. The reason why Shanghai has been able to have a large amount of silver flowing in from foreign countries this year is precisely because China's silver reserves have been affected by the US silver policy, and foreign outflow is almost exhausted, which has caused a major financial panic in Shanghai. In order to maintain the situation, our financial authorities and the financial sector painfully sold a large amount of gold, and exchanged silver back from London and Hong Kong at high prices for turnover, so this year's inflow of foreign silver in Shanghai is an artificial phenomenon, which does not benefit China much, and actually suffers losses. (Because the silver price was at its peak when foreign silver was purchased, and now it has gradually fallen) From the surface, the amount of silver exported to foreign countries is very small, but after a little investigation, it is known that it is not. In the past six months, Shanghai's silver transported to coastal ports accounted for almost half of the total exports. This number has the possibility of being smuggled abroad. In terms of commercial relations, Shanghai is in a position of trade surplus with coastal ports. In theory, silver from coastal ports should flow into Shanghai, but now Shanghai's silver is flowing to coastal ports, which is actually an unreasonable phenomenon. Therefore, the purpose of Shanghai's silver transportation to coastal ports this year can also be imagined. Furthermore, in terms of geographical relations, Tianjin is located in North China. Because of the convenience of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, a certain country's浪人has greatly smuggled silver out of the customs. This kind of incident has been reported in the newspapers many times. As for Xiamen, Fuzhou, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places, they are also the sphere of activity of a certain country's forces, so although our government has strictly ordered the prohibition, the smuggling wind has not stopped slightly. From this point of view, the 9,610,000 yuan of silver that Shanghai transported to coastal ports has actually been smuggled abroad. Adding the 850,000 yuan that was directly transported to foreign countries, it accounts for 54% of the total exports, which is a huge amount and is truly shocking. As for the more than 9.5 million yuan of silver that Shanghai transported to the inland areas in the past six months, it only accounts for 46% of the total exports, and the actual number is only 9.55 million yuan. At the time of reviving the inland areas, this number is really too small.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above sections, we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Although Shanghai's silver reserves have shown an increasing trend in the past six months, they are far from the same period last year and the end of last year, and after May, there is a tendency to decrease again.</p>
<p>(2) The increase in Shanghai's silver reserves in the past six months was caused by the increase in the reserves of foreign banks, while the reserves of Chinese banks have decreased compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai still has a huge trade surplus of silver, and the direction of exports is still more to foreign countries (including the number smuggled by coastal ports) than to the inland areas.</p>
<p>All these phenomena are extremely unfavorable to our country's economy and finance, so we are very pessimistic about the changes in Shanghai's silver reserves in the past six months.</p>
<p>In terms of Shanghai's financial seasonal changes, the first half of the year is the period of silver inflow, with abundant reserves and loose market conditions. The second half of the year is the period of silver outflow, with reduced reserves and tight market conditions. In the first half of this year, Shanghai's silver has already flowed out in large quantities, the reserves have been exhausted, and the market is very tight. Then, if Shanghai's financial panic in the second half of the year is not fundamentally resolved in time, the severity of the situation is even more unimaginable. Now let us quote the words of Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, as the end of this article: Mr. Lin said, "The financial situation of this city has been safely passed in the first half of the year with the utmost relief from the Ministry of Finance and the silver and money industry. On the surface, it has tended to be stable, but in fact, the crisis is still deep. The previous relief was still a stopgap measure, and in the future, we must focus on the root cause, otherwise, it will inevitably collapse." Now we can only look forward to the early realization of the "root cause" solution!</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange Public Bills Continue to be Accepted and Cleared - Only Thirty-Eight Notes Remain Uncleared</h3>
<p>The cash settlement of the financial exchange in August has been accepting and clearing public bills since the beginning, and now only extremely scattered notes remain. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the settlement was extended to today. The shorts have already cleared their positions, accounting for 14 notes from Ying Feng Heng and 7 notes from Yong Feng. Today, the longs should receive 21 notes from She Fu Xing Yong, with a settlement price of 905 yuan. Currently, only 28 August notes remain, with longs accounting for 21 notes from永 and 7 notes from 恒永, and shorts accounting for 14 notes each from 泰永 and 丰永. In total, there are only two long and short parties.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bullish Bond Market Slightly Emerged Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, August 5th to 10th, was one of the last half-day trading periods for the Shanghai Securities Exchange (whether it will be extended will be decided today). All transactions decreased, and market prices were relatively stable, showing signs of consolidation. However, after the news of the situation in a certain county in Jiangsu Province being suppressed spread, the market price was briefly stimulated. Premier Wang's sudden actions caused another shock to the market sentiment. The bullish front gradually weakened. The major bullish players in the market, led by No. 48, continued to buy in large quantities. Recently, they have been slightly selling off. Northern traders were also selling more than buying. Numbers 4 and 16 also sold off a lot. Rumors of inflation were rampant, all of which negatively affected market prices, making it difficult for the trend to recover temporarily. Over the past week, Monday saw ups and downs, with some fluctuations, but the movements were minimal and relatively weak. On Tuesday, due to the incident in the aforementioned county, numbers 4, 16, and northern traders sold off. At the same time, the inflationary trend began to take shape. Although No. 48 continued to buy, the quantities were small, and prices fell by 20 to 30 cents to about one yuan. On Wednesday, the incident in the county did not significantly affect the market. Prices initially fell and then rose, with numbers 11 and 21 buying in, resulting in mixed outcomes. On Thursday, northern traders sold off, and No. 48 showed no appetite for buying. Market prices fluctuated with a weak undertone. On Friday, there was no new news. Numbers 20 and 21 bought in, causing prices to rebound by 5 to 10 cents to half a yuan. On Saturday, rumors suddenly spread that Premier Wang had resigned from all his positions and that new public bonds would be issued, further shaking market sentiment. At the same time, No. 48 suddenly sold off, and the bullish front showed signs of weakening, with prices falling by 10 to 60 cents. Overall, the week's trend was characterized by No. 48's reduced buying appetite and a tendency to sell off, as well as sudden changes in environmental news, all of which caused bullish investors to become apprehensive, leading to a further decline in market prices, which was not unexpected. The 96 Public Bonds suddenly rose to 11 yuan, but then weakened again. Those who suppressed the small market were the same people who had raised the price. The one who tied the bell is the one who unties it. It is said that a large amount of spot goods are being shipped from the North. The future of 96 Public Bonds may be viewed with pessimism again. As a result of the week's market prices, most bonds fell by 10 to 20 cents to 70 to 80 cents. The total volume of transactions was 49,135,000 yuan. The following table compares the results of the price increases and decreases: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<h3>Grains: River Rice Still Being Adjusted Downward</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, over twenty vendors arrived with shipments (totaling nearly 5,000 piculs). Sales in the main street market remained sluggish. Only vendors from Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other areas bought a few hundred bags. The market sentiment remained downward. Prices for various thick japonica and thin indica rice continued to decline by two cents. Due to the sunny weather, the price of Dongxin japonica rice decreased by two cents. The situation was similar for rough rice. Yinbian yuan rice had no market and no trading.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: American Cotton Merchants and Spot Traders Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened firm but lacked activity, with prices rising by three to seven points for each month. Subsequently, some traders bought at limit prices, and spot traders purchased October and December contracts, causing market prices to continue to strengthen. At the same time, favorable news from Liverpool and fewer sellers also contributed to the rise. However, buyers still intended to speculate, and the Italian-Libyan Association intended to purchase, but the quantities were limited due to loan issues. The weather was still good, and the western region needed sudden rain. In the southern regions of Bahía and Alagoas, ginning increased, and hedging was not significant. If loans are not established, hedging may increase. Spot demand is sluggish, and textiles are firm and expensive. Finally, due to some local selling, prices softened slightly. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose by one to seven points. British cotton spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by five to seven points. Indian cotton saw some bullish liquidation, with Pingguor and Omra rising by 1.25 rupees and Bailuoxi rising by 1 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 10th):</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: New Hainan Longan Rose by Six and a Half Yuan</h3>

<h3>Metals: Metal Autumn Sales Are Very Active; Sales Will Not Be Reduced Due to High Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate has tightened, and the cost of various metal goods has increased significantly. Market traders are mutually raising prices due to capital concerns and are unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market atmosphere is inflated. Moreover, since the beginning of autumn, various industries have gradually started to operate, so the metal industry also has a developing atmosphere. The main points are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Hui Si Iron: 200-pound Hui Si iron has recently been actively purchased by canneries, thermos bottle factories, and canning factories, resulting in a large number of transactions. Regarding prices, due to the shortage of foreign exchange, market sentiment is unusually optimistic, and valuations have increased significantly. Genuine goods are offered at 27 yuan per box, an increase of 1 yuan from before, and sub-standard goods are also offered at 26 yuan, an increase of 50 cents. It is reported that over 300 boxes were traded yesterday, so the future market situation is very promising.</p>
<p>Large Tinplate: 24-gauge and 26-gauge large tinplate are running out of stock in the market, and standards are frequently increasing, with prices rising by 2 yuan to 10 yuan per box. Buyers are still not reducing their demand due to high prices. Therefore, 24-gauge is offered at 70 yuan per box, and 26-gauge is offered at 52 yuan. It is reported that traders and retailers have offered more than a dozen boxes.</p>
<p>Iron: Recently, thermos bottle factories have started to purchase, so the market atmosphere is not as bleak as before. The price is offered at 7 yuan, an increase of 50 cents from before, with over 100 bundles traded. Moreover, the exchange rate has recently fallen sharply, and market sentiment is unusually strong, so the standards may rise without falling.</p>
<p>Bamboo Steel Bars: Although the outflow has not been significant recently, market sentiment is very good. Standards have risen by 2 yuan, with textured bars valued at 94-95 yuan, while credit sales cannot be lower than 97-98 yuan. Because traders all want to avoid losses, they are vigorously raising prices, so there is no hope for a price decline in the future market.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>About "Pure Literature"</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>On the centenary of Théophile Gautier, André Gide wrote a short comment on this writer, beginning:</p>
<p>"I don't want to criticize Gautier's 'art for art's sake' theory; besides that, I don't know what other reason for existence there is. However, he compresses art so that it can only express so few things, which is not acceptable."</p>
<p>This statement is fair enough.</p>
<p>Since it is art, of course, one cannot call it not art, but it is necessary to make art transcend life, divorce itself from reality, and become an "empty" "beauty of technique" that can only express "momentary experiences." This really compresses the volume of art too much.</p>
<p>So-called "pure literature" is a kind of "art for art's sake." Lascelles Abercrombie, professor of English literature at the University of London, in the second section of his book "Principles of Literary Criticism," discusses the principles of pure literature, saying that pure literature is the art of using words to convey pure experience, and that experience is a "pure experience whose value can be enjoyed in itself." "For example, when looking at scenery, if I am a farmer, I will criticize it according to the practical value of the scenery: I myself think about whether what I see is a good piece of land that can be cultivated. On the other hand, I can also just use this experience of viewing the scenery, and make myself feel very satisfied, without any problems arising. All I feel is that this scenery is very beautiful. When I perceive it in this way, what I experience becomes a 'past experience' that greatly satisfies me. If I express this feeling, my expression has no purpose. If my expression is expressed in words, the result is literature."</p>
<p>This argument is the same as "art for art's sake" and aestheticism.</p>
<p>According to this argument, most of the world's famous works from ancient times to the present are not literary works, because most of the famous works in history not only express momentary experiences of beauty and joy, but also suggest fundamental problems of life.</p>
<p>However, according to Professor Abercrombie, on the other hand, it can be said that there are many works of pure literature. He cited Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" as an example:</p>
<p>"If we disregard whether the historical facts in this book are correct or whether the explanations are reliable, and only treat it as a magnificent story that appears in the imagination, it is certainly a good work of pure literature, because the expressiveness of this book is very good... If we treat works of practical learning as pure literature, we must disregard the author's purpose. In other words, whatever the author considers a means or tool to achieve the purpose, we consider it the purpose itself. But in pure literature, there is no need to exclude the author's purpose; because pure literature has no purpose other than expression itself."</p>
<p>Only asking about means, not purpose, only discussing form, not content, this kind of view is very consistent with the views of Chinese literati on writing during the era of stagnation. Zhuangzi is literature because it is well-written, Mencius is literature because it is well-written, and Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han are literature, not because of their expressive power, but their philosophical, political, and historical values ​​are ignored.</p>
<p>Such a theory of pure literature is very strange. It excludes works that are clearly literary works from literature, but circles works that are not literary works into literature; it not only separates literature from reality and abandons reality, but also separates the content and form of works and abandons the content. The strangest thing is that it originates from the same argument as "art for art's sake," but the result completely negates "art for art's sake": Gibbon, Zhuang Zhou, Mencius, Ban Gu, and Ma Qian's works were originally absolutely not "art for art's sake"!</p>
<h3>Middle Age</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jiao</p>
<p>Recently, the whole family has been struggling with illness. First, the child was sick, crying all day and night, and my wife had to get up five or six times a night. Then my wife got sick. Now even I have fallen ill.</p>
<p>Carrying a heavy head, I still have to hum songs that I don't even know to my sick child, while holding him and pacing back and forth. In this way, sometimes I feel that this is the most competent and most appropriate job.</p>
<p>Then a serious question attacked my mind.</p>
<p>After all, I have to rely on my own strength to make a living. If I continue to be sick like this, not to mention treatment, the problem of eating quickly will arise. What should I do?</p>
<p>I lit the lamp; I couldn't sleep. The child's pale face was lying on my arm, constantly gasping for breath. When the light came on, he was startled and cried weakly. My wife also woke me up and comforted me with a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Don't worry! If we can't survive in Shanghai, we will decide to retreat to the countryside. Would Mom and Dad drive us out? Sleep, just sleep, Dong."</p>
<p>I ignored her, I was still thinking with my eyes open. I remember a friend once told me that once you have children, you can't be a child anymore. Yes, I still have parents now, so I can still be my parents' child for a while. What if my father and mother both died? Then I remembered that the year my grandfather died when I was young, my father had taken mercury to commit suicide. When others discovered it and asked him in panic:</p>
<p>"That is, what was that for?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing," he smiled faintly, "Once a person reaches middle age, it's really more comfortable to just sleep!"</p>
<p>From this rescue onwards, really, my father was always drowsily sleeping in alcohol.</p>
<p>I never understood this scene before, but now I understand it. If there were no way out for me on this line of life, tonight, I might also use mercury.</p>
<p>As if Anatole France said, life is like a bridge, and middle-aged people are like walking to the top of the bridge, developing to the highest point, and then they begin to decline. (The general idea is like this.) That's right, I am now standing on top of the bridge. On this side of the bridge, I see my child slowly climbing up; on the other side of the bridge, I see my father faltering downwards in defeat. My situation is just like using my right hand to pull my child up and using my left hand to push my father down earlier. As for my father, he is tiredly carrying the two of us, not knowing where to lead us to the non-existent land.</p>
<p>Then, I thought of myself again. When my child walks to the top of the bridge, what will happen to me? Ah, I can't think about it. My life has already developed to the highest point, and the world has already given me a "type," and the ultimate development of this "type" is like this! If I continue to decline, what will happen... No, I don't want to think about it anymore, I'm afraid! Friend, let me rest, I'm afraid, I'm afraid of this kind of sharpening!</p>
<h3>In the Nunnery</h3>
<p>— Shu Jiang</p>
<p>After chanting the evening scriptures, the setting sun was also gone,</p>
<p>The scripture scrolls lay lazily in the Buddha hall.</p>
<p>The sounds of bells and cymbals had long since died away,</p>
<p>Thick incense smoke slowly swirled in front of the Buddha statue.</p>
<p>But her disturbed heart could no longer be quiet,</p>
<p>She sighed, watching the falling petals.</p>
<p>Anxiety grew,</p>
<p>And patches of blush rose on her face.</p>
<p>It seemed that little birds were fluttering and jumping in her heart,</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and pressed her chest tightly with her hands.</p>
<p>She hoped the evening breeze would blow away the heat on her face and in her heart,</p>
<p>But, it didn't work. She ran back and sobbed at the head of the bed!</p>
<h3>Can Ju Li (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>When Director Shi, the most esteemed old tea customer of "Can Ju," entered like a ghost, A’gen, who was stoking the stove with his rear end high in the air, didn't notice him. No, he didn't expect Director Shi to come to the teahouse so early.</p>
<p>As usual, Director Shi sat down on the rattan chair by the window, breathing slightly, with a thin layer of sweat on his forehead, as if he had run a distance or settled a public case. But he forced himself to calm down, took out a silk handkerchief folded like a dried tofu from the narrow sleeve of his sky-blue linen shirt, politely wiped the sweat, and carefully tucked it back into his sleeve. Then, with fingers that had inch-long fingernails, he tapped a soft, rhythmic sound on the white wooden table—this action indicated that a major public case was biting at his heart like a snake. Anyone in Wujia Town who had seen Director Shi's face knew this "trick." A'gen, of course, had seen it many times. But this time, he was so startled that he jumped up, cursing "damn it" under his breath, his eyes already catching the elongated face of the esteemed guest. Now he didn't know how to cover up his mistake! He thought of slapping himself hard, but Director Shi opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"A'gen, what time did you close yesterday?"</p>
<p>Director Shi showed no anger, withdrawing his right hand from the table to stroke his unkempt mustache. Director Shi himself knew this was a flaw, but a director without a mustache was even more "improper." So whenever he had something important on his mind, he would subconsciously stroke his mustache, as if the disheveled mustache was somehow related to his worries.</p>
<p>A'gen lowered his head, looking as if a catastrophe was about to befall him, but the question was clear: "A'gen, what time did you close yesterday?" His simple mind couldn't figure out what relationship there was between this and his cursing "damn it," and he was so preoccupied with that "relationship" that he forgot to answer Director Shi's question first.</p>
<p>"Was it at the usual time?"</p>
<p>Director Shi was truly in a good mood today, stroking his mustache even more vigorously, while also using his sharp gaze to search for something on A'gen's face.</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Shi!" When calling him Master Shi, A'gen was like a toy chicken pecking at food, always having to bend his waist first. But in his heart, he was still pondering that "relationship."</p>
<p>"Did anyone come later?"</p>
<p>This voice sounded like he was judging a public case, and it was like thunder in A'gen's ears.</p>
<p>"No! No! Master Shi!" A'gen kept bending over, as if there was a real thunderclap circling above his head, afraid to look up.</p>
<p>"Really?" Master Shi emphasized once more before telling A'gen to brew tea.</p>
<p>This left A'gen completely bewildered. As he reached under the shelf for the purple clay teapot, he suddenly remembered the scene in "The狸猫换太子" where Judge Bao was interrogating the stone. Master Shi asking about "closing" must have a reason, Master Shi was using that... that... A'gen couldn't name the method, to try to judge a bizarre public case. But he, A'gen, was a well-known good person, what "relationship" did he have with closing up? But Master Shi must not have heard that "damn it." Relieved, he added a few extra dried orange blossoms to the teapot and selected the highest-quality green tea (Note 2) to present to Master Shi.</p>
<p>"Master Shi, how many sesame cakes will you have?"</p>
<p>Actually, this was A'gen's superfluous question, he just wanted to be particularly attentive. Director Shi eating two sesame cakes at "Can Ju" every day had become a story in Wujia Town. For example, if a child spent a few extra copper coins that day, the parents would definitely scold him, citing the fact that "Master Shi only eats two sesame cakes a day."</p>
<p>But Director Shi shook his head, this clearly had some "relationship" again. He tapped the table with his fingernails again, as if writing an epitaph or a congratulatory essay, tapping and drumming for a good quarter of an hour before slapping the table with his palm. Although it wasn't as forceful as A'gen spitting, it was already an "improper" action for a scholar. But A'gen didn't understand those "refined" airs, he stood blankly by the table, opening his mouth without purpose.</p>
<p>Master Shi took out the dried tofu handkerchief from his sleeve again. Now he wasn't wiping sweat, the handkerchief was passed from his right hand to his left, and from his left hand to his right, looking like a woman playing with the hem of her clothes, somewhat embarrassed. Again, for a good quarter of an hour, he lowered his old voice and said to A'gen so gently that he almost raised his hand to pat A'gen's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Do you know about the news of that little rascal A'xing coming back?"</p>
<p>That A'xing? A'gen almost suspected that Master Shi was going crazy today, those topics were all ones that A'gen couldn't figure out how to answer. Closing up, A'xing, but not wanting to eat sesame cakes, Judge Bao interrogating the stone wasn't like this either.</p>
<p>"It's that little rascal A'xing from the Lu family." Master Shi realized that A'gen was clueless and added.</p>
<p>"Oh, that ×××..."</p>
<p>"Don't mess around!" Master Shi was like a real Judge Bao now, his face turning green: "I'm asking if you know or not, don't talk nonsense!"</p>
<p>A'gen could only shake his head, all the relationships he had in his stomach were scared away.</p>
<p>"So you don't know."</p>
<p>At this time, two people walked in from outside. Director Shi knew that such a situation would arouse suspicion, so he said this, as if telling A'gen not to keep shaking his head like a machine.</p>
<p>The incoming guests coughed, this was another affectation of "scholars," announcing their arrival before entering. "Can Ju" was full of refined tea customers, but Director Shi entered "Can Ju" today like a thief, he didn't cough, he was thinking about something else and forgot this mannerism.</p>
<p>No matter how stupid A'gen was like a piece of wood, he had experience hearing coughs, he immediately turned around, bent over, and shouted "Master" several times.</p>
<p>Director Shi deliberately stared at the teacup in a daze, waiting until the two masters walked to his table and asked, "Director, good morning?" Then he pretended to be hurried, put down the teacup, stood up, held his left fist with his right palm, like devout men and women seeking a fortune at a temple, and pulled a few times, saying, "Master Mu, Master Lian, good morning?"</p>
<h3>Thus Thus</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<h3>The Tragedy by the Sea (1)</h3>
<p>— Original by French writer Balzac, translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>The path from Lecroisie to the town of Batut is not a firmly trodden path; a gust of wind will erase the ruts left by wheels or the footprints of hooves. But our guide's experienced eyes can rely on the tracks of livestock and sheep droppings to find the path's location. This path, according to the terrain and the position of the rocks it surrounds, dips in some places to the sea and rises in others to the fields.</p>
<p>It was noon, and we had only traveled half the journey.</p>
<p>"We can rest over there for a while," I said, pointing to the cliffs with their towering rocks. It seemed we could find a secluded place there.</p>
<p>When the fisherman, his gaze following the direction I pointed, heard my words, he shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"There is a man there! Every traveler from Batut to Lecroisie or from Lecroisie to Batut always takes a detour to avoid passing in front of him."</p>
<p>The fisherman spoke these words in a low tone, a tone that immediately evoked a sense of mystery.</p>
<p>"Then is he a robber or an assassin?"</p>
<p>Our guide (referring to the fisherman)'s only answer was a long and empty exclamation, which further increased our curiosity.</p>
<p>"But, if we really walk over there, will we encounter an accident?"</p>
<p>"Ah, no."</p>
<p>"Are you willing to go with us?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Hey, if you can guarantee that there is no danger in going there, we must go."</p>
<p>"It's not like that," the fisherman quickly replied. "I only know that the person sitting there will definitely not say a word to you, nor will he harm you. He will definitely sit motionless in his original position."</p>
<p>"Then what kind of person is he exactly?"</p>
<p>"A man!"</p>
<p>I had never heard these words spoken in such a tragic tone in my life. At that time, we were about twenty steps away from the small bay where the waves were crashing. Our guide chose the road around the rocks, and we continued to walk forward. But Bao Ling tightly held my arm, and our guide, in order to reach the intersection of the two roads, which was also where we were to meet, quickened his pace forward. He clearly anticipated that after we caught a glimpse of that person, we would have to walk away quickly. This situation aroused our curiosity, and this curiosity burned so vigorously that our hearts beat very hard, as if we had been attacked by a feeling of terror.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Steams Buns to Help Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Flood prevention and disaster relief are important tasks currently in China. While the government authorities are undoubtedly responsible, the people of the whole country should unite to help. Mr. Ma Xiangbo came out to appeal loudly, urging the people of the country to save money and relieve the disaster. But until now, not many people in the country have truly been moved with compassion. Therefore, unless the method of "entertainment to save the country" is used, performing a few days of opera or dancing once can get a sum of money. Otherwise, to wait for the people of the country to voluntarily and generously donate, the disaster victims can only eat bark and grass roots. However, those who do not shirk their responsibility are not non-existent. Recently, overseas Chinese have remitted money to help with disaster relief. There are already several. Loving the motherland, the overseas Chinese are indeed the most enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The other day, the newspaper delivery boy brought a newspaper, and mistakenly inserted a "Ta Kung Pao." I flipped through it and saw such a piece of news: (Tai'an Correspondence) This county has taken in more than a thousand disaster victims from Yuncheng and Jining, and the shelters are mostly in the Beishanpo area. In recent days, Mr. Feng Yuxiang steamed a large number of jujube steamed buns and sent Pan Tingxi to lead guards to transport them to various shelters in the early morning, giving each person two, and instructed them not to disturb the management office staff, nor to let the disaster victims know that they were sent by Mr. Feng. It has been several days now, and it has gradually become known.</p>
<p>Naturally, the work of saving the country is something everyone should strive for. I am not saying that Mr. Feng's steaming buns and distributing them to the disaster victims is worthy of special praise, nor am I saying that the buns steamed by Mr. Feng came from his own savings. What I admire is that Mr. Feng's disaster relief work is really the most practical. He understands that helping disaster victims is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, to save the disaster, he does not donate money to any charity. Because it's too much trouble, and distant water cannot put out a nearby fire. So he steams a batch of buns every day and sends people to transport them to various shelters for distribution. Two buns are not much, but more than a thousand disaster victims in Yuncheng and Jining have benefited greatly.</p>
<p>How many millions of disaster victims in various places are crying out for food? How will the people of the country who have the ability to steam buns help them?</p>
<h3>Small Songs of Mountain Life</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>("The mountains in summer are a gorgeous palette. Here are lush green bushes, golden wildflowers, crimson plums, and emerald melons. The mountain is purple, and the clouds, when reflecting the sun, are extravagantly gilded! The mountains in summer are also a concert of the grandest and most complex symphony. Here, the nightingale's voice is soprano, flowing like smooth stream water, all the way to the tip of youth. On the other side, chirping is the old crow, using the lowest tone, like an old cleric, singing out the silence of old age. Or, maybe you like the bizarre scriptures of the owl in the midnight valley, which may inspire the mystery of the stars in the universe, or may tell you the news of the ghosts in hell. You will like them, maybe? The mountains in summer are a grand gathering of nature's sounds and colors. It is like a great book unfolding to you, narrating to you everything in the world as much as possible: the gorgeous and the somber, the youthful and the old. If one has the courage to see life, one must also have the courage to love the mountains in summer. Maybe the gasoline and typewriters in the metropolis have ruined your mood? Find a chance to live in the mountains for a few days. From here, you will regain your lost self! Moreover, it's summer again...")</p>
<p>As if a gust of cool rain had struck, I was startled awake by my friend's beautiful, dream-like description of the mountains: it's summer, it's already summer!</p>
<p>Clearly, shouldn't those who wander aimlessly in this city be mocked? "They can only remember the beginning and end of the month, and have no right to pay attention to the passage of seasons." However, does life controlling people to stay in a solidified area, isn't that absolutely true, and not easy to change, not allowing wishful thinking?</p>
<p>But, the mountains are lovely, and summer is lovely too! At the thought of the difficulty of sweating in front of the typewriter, I have been dreaming of the deep mountains and forests of summer more than once or twice.</p>
<p>Finally, I took a breath and took a small risk with life, temporarily saying goodbye to the softened asphalt streets in the metropolis, and went to the quiet, deep, and familiar mountains.</p>
<p>There, the sun always shines like a medieval oriental maiden, shyly filtered through the gaps in the dense branches, and gently sprinkled on the stone-paved mountain road. Then, people walk meanderingly on the gilded pavement to the distant front...</p>
<p>Those who grow up in the mountains should not ignore this situation: at dusk and dawn, rising all around is a layer of soft, light mist. In the hazy sky, it blends the crimson gold in the sun with the cyan of the mountains, creating a soft, purple smoke that lightly envelops the mountains, the trees, the sparse and leisurely houses, and the mountain springs that flow endlessly northward.</p>
<p>The days in the mountains pass stealthily - they always pass secretly without people knowing: walk a circle, learn a little bit of planting and cultivating the land from the elderly neighbors, listen to them talk about the disappointments in life and harvests, a smile, a worry, and then, dusk comes, night comes, the next morning comes...</p>
<p>Moreover, summer has dressed it up inside and out. It really is a medley of colors. Summer is abundant, and the mountains of summer are also abundant. Nature's colors and sounds gather there, and along with all the fruits, they mature fully and richly.</p>
<p>Everything is ripe, the whole mountain! And following that, those who love the mountains and grow up in the deep forests, perhaps a little something will grow in their simple hearts, and, along with this whole mountain, it will mature and become abundant!</p>
<p>Those who love the mountains treat the mountains as a treasure trove of nature!</p>
<h3>Second Class Carriage</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<p>Due to my profession, I can say that I spend all year round traveling on the rails, but stepping into a second-class carriage like a noble gentleman is a first for me. In advance, a friend in the company prepared to travel with me, and he got two half-price tickets for the second class, but due to special reasons, he left the day before. When I stepped into the carriage, I was thinking about whether my uncle's condition could improve as people expected. Things that are very certain often have the opposite result.</p>
<p>No more than a minute after I settled down, the train started. The second-class carriage was not full with more than ten passengers, each occupying two seats, leaning back like they are in a sofa to flip through the newspaper or a magazine or something of the day, while smoking cigarettes. Following the vibration of the train, they were like a child in a cradle; they gently closed their eyes to appreciate the unique charm of the journey. Although I am called a "frequent traveler," my experience in this regard is far from enough. I often warn my colleagues not to bring newspapers on the train. We should always pay attention to our luggage. If you want to use this time to read the newspaper, sitting in the car is not as comfortable as sitting at a desk. When it's bumping so badly, you can't see what news is printed on the newspaper. If someone takes away a piece of your luggage, the loss is enough to regret for a lifetime. But this experience applied to the second-class carriage is a complete failure. It's more comfortable here than sitting at a desk. On a long journey, you must think of something to pass the time. My suitcase has never contained a newspaper, even one from a few days ago. So I thought of that guy who raises his voice and squeezes in and out of the crowd. Every time I met him, he never failed to ask me if I wanted to buy a newspaper. Now that I need him, I don't know if that guy jumped on the train before it started.</p>
<p>A servant in a white uniform came in, holding a specially made wooden tray with a dozen cups of tea on it. He walked in front of each guest and put down a cup without explanation. The attitude was much better than "Sir, would you like a pot of tea?" in the third-class carriage. Passing in front of me, he naturally wouldn't leave this cup empty. At such a boring time, all I could do to pass the time was to smoke and drink tea, so I really wanted to reject this unnecessary cup of tea, but I didn't say it. I looked at the clear tea under the white porcelain saucer, at the floating tea leaves, and imagined that a person in society is probably like that, spinning around. When the current scenery gradually became blurred, perhaps I had fallen into the abyss of life.</p>
<p>I slept through many hours just like that, it's really something I never expected. Travelers should always be on guard, it was the first time I was so careless and forgot that I was on a journey. It was that sharp whistle that woke me up. It had already passed several docks, and a modern lady had come to sit opposite me sometime. Her right finger skillfully held a cigarette, raised her head, and watched the smoke rings she exhaled, focusing as if she were considering a tricky matter. Seeing me wake up, she hurriedly packed up the newspapers, cigarettes, cream cakes, fruits, and several colorful pornographic magazines scattered on the table. She seemed so flustered, nodded apologetically to me, and brought my teacup to me. This made me feel a little embarrassed. I casually returned the greeting, picked up my teacup, but it was already warm. She seemed to be paying special attention to my actions, immediately pushed her teacup over, and offered me a cigarette. I wanted to decline, but I couldn't say a polite word. I was so straightforward that I never knew how to be polite among friends. However, now there was an unfamiliar woman in front of me, and I didn't know what to say. With no other choice, I took her cigarette and put it on the table, immediately stood up and went to the toilet, and then pretended to be nonchalant and sat in another seat. But when my gaze fell on my suitcase, another man had taken my original seat, and they were talking very intimately, the woman deliberately laughing loudly, as if showing off to someone.</p>
<p>This time I really had my eyes opened. The division between the second-class and third-class carriages shattered my experience as a "frequent traveler." So I even hoped that I would have the opportunity to go to the first-class carriage to see what it's like next time.</p>
<h3>Caged Bird</h3>
<p>— Da Yun</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I was unusually fond of playing with animals. We had a gray and white cat and a black dog at home. Apart from eating and sleeping, I spent most of my time playing with the cat and dog. We also had three roosters and four hens. When the hens laid eggs, my mother would save them up. On our brothers’ birthdays, we always got four eggs each to cook as snacks. My second brother and I would often grab a hen each, hug it tightly with both hands, spit on the ground, and spin the hen around and around. Then we would forcefully plant it on the spittle. That way, the hen we were playing with couldn't escape even if we let go. Whoever's hen moved first was the weaker one. However, this game gradually became boring. At that time, a desire floated into my mind, hoping to raise a beautiful little bird. That would be really fun!</p>
<p>Soon, my loving grandmother, always so compliant with her grandchildren's wishes, bought me a delicate and clever White-eye bird. Its feathers were bright green, its belly golden, and it hopped and jumped freely in its cage, singing clear and melodious songs. We were extremely happy! We didn't even want to leave it easily when eating. We cherished it as much as our own lives! Everyone took turns saving a little pocket money to provide for its food. Later, I reached the age to go to school.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In the morning, I would go to school and only return home in the evening. I handed over the responsibility of feeding it to Xiao Mei, but I still couldn't stop worrying about it every day. While listening to the teacher's explanations in the classroom, I always thought of that clever little bird at home.</p>
<p>It was already the Spring Festival holiday. My mother had also moved back home from school, giving us the opportunity to be together, and my little heart felt infinitely comforted. Perhaps because of this, I gradually became indifferent to the little bird in the cage. Moreover, my mother had always been extremely opposed to raising birds, especially birds in cages. She believed it was a cruel thing. Isn't a small cage like a prison on earth? People deprive birds of their freedom for their own little pleasure, which is too cruel!</p>
<p>One day, I was returning home with my mother from playing at a friend's house. As soon as Xiao Mei saw me, she scurried into a corner like smoke. This made me a little confused, so I pressed her for an explanation. She trembled as if she were a mouse meeting a cat, afraid that I would get angry and whip her with a rattan cane. My grandmother always tried to smooth things over. On one hand, she blamed Xiao Mei for being careless, and on the other hand, she told me how the bird in the cage had been let loose by Xiao Mei. She said she would buy me an even more beautiful one in a few days. She was simply coaxing me, meaning to spare Xiao Mei a whipping. Although I was young, I had already seen through my grandmother's intentions. My mother also made light of the situation, speaking up for her. In fact, since my mother had returned home for the holidays, I no longer missed the little bird in the cage as much as before. Just as everyone was chattering, my second younger sister came over happily and told me that the little bird was under the peach tree in the yard, bleeding profusely and looking quite scary. He Ma said that Ah Hei (the black dog) had just chased and bitten it. Fortunately, she was there and shouted at the dog, preventing it from being swallowed. This news immediately surprised us all. I saw its tragic death, and a chilling atmosphere filled my heart. My eyes filled with tears, which fell down in a flurry.</p>
<p>This incident that happened a full twenty years ago is still clearly imprinted in my mind. However, with the changes in the environment, I have tasted the cruelty of society for ten years. Looking back at myself, haven't I been deprived of my will and lost my lively freedom, just like a caged bird?</p>

<p>Confucius said: "Guide them with government, regulate them with punishments, and the people will avoid wrongdoing but have no sense of shame. Guide them with virtue, regulate them with ritual, and they will have shame and moreover be upright." It is because the world is made to feel shame that transformation can be achieved. If you use fraud and deceit, stealing a living and seeking favor, and superiors do this, how can you lead those below? Was Qin's defeat not fitting? During the Warring States period, the virtue of the rulers was shallow. Those who devised strategies for them had to rely on the situation and emphasize the times. Thus, the use of arms was an urgent matter. All were talented scholars, assessing what the rulers of the time could do, devising ingenious plans and extraordinary wisdom, turning danger into safety, and turning destruction into survival. This is commendable and worth observing.</p>

<h3>Storytelling Singing</h3>
<p>Lu Fengxiang, Lu Xiaoxiang, Tale of the White Snake</p>
<p>Shanghai (1200), 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Selling Jade and Crying at the Coffin"</p>
<p>The passionate are always deeply devoted. Since ancient times, beautiful women have been destined for misfortune. It is lamentable that after Qian Nv's soul departed, the Xiao and Xiang rivers no longer brought forth spring. The amorous son of Yi Hong (from Dream of the Red Chamber) cannot exhaust his feelings, and expresses his sincere heart before the coffin. All that is seen is that the grass and trees wither and the sound is silent, a desolate scene full of shadows. The parrot does not know the state of mind and chants the poem "Burying Flowers" in a murmur. Seeing the saddle, one must think of the horse. Seeing things, how can one not think of the person? Sister, your unparalleled talent and beauty have now vanished, leaving only relics before me. I only hoped to be with you forever, but who knew that everything is determined by heaven, not by man. It is pitiful that you suffered so much from a young age, and it is pitiful that you went to the underworld with regret. I remember when we were young, we played together like green plums and bamboo horses. Today, we can no longer be intimate. I remember when we admired the moon and flowers together, composing poems. Today, we can no longer write poems. I remember when our hearts were in tune and we were so close. Today, we can no longer be together. I remember when your every smile and glance was infinitely beautiful. Today, I can no longer see your face. Now, I silently plead before your coffin. Do you hear me in the underworld? Sadly, tears fall like rain, as if drunk and lost in a trance. Truly, wealth and glory are like a spring night, and everyone gathers on the stage waiting for the autumn clouds. It is better to jump out of the land of煩惱 and cut off this endless love from now on, to be a free and easy person outside the world.</p>
<p>Tang Zhuping, Fallen Golden Fan</p>
<p>Huaguang (1480), 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Jian, the Child Prodigy, Assassinating Liang"</p>
<p>Liang Ji, the great traitor of the Han Dynasty, held power and frightened everyone inside and outside the court. He overheard a fortune teller say a sentence that made him extremely cautious. He surrounded himself with guards and kept a close watch, constantly guarding against assassins. It was difficult for even a three-foot-tall child to enter, and only singers were allowed to entertain him with songs. An urgent document arrived from Hedong, delivered by a family general to the turning gate. He cut the lamp and examined it carefully. Suddenly, he saw a shadow flicker in front of the lamp. Du Qiao and Li Gu, two loyal souls, had arrived. They quietly avoided the crowd, afraid of disturbing his dreams. Fei Xia was filled with resentment for her father's murder and had disguised herself as a singer. It was the fourth watch, and no one was around. She gritted her teeth and extended her hatred. It has always been said that where there is a will, there is a way. She held a three-inch nail door pin in her hand. One day, she was able to repay her filial daughter's heart.</p>

<h3>Lu Lixia Becomes a Mother</h3>
<h3>"The Call of the Wild" Opens</h3>
<p>The famous film "The Call of the Wild" by United Artists 20th Century Corporation is originally a proud work of the great writer Jack London. The content depicts the various inevitable sins of mankind, such as the madness of money worship, the nature of greed, tyranny, cruelty, and the impulse and desire to plunder and possess. It is indeed a rare work in the genre of adventure and romance novels. The literary circles in our country have translated it and titled it with its current name. It is especially well-known in Europe and the United States, so its performance on the screen should cause a great stir among movie fans and also gain the unusual support of the literary and artistic circles. What's more, the starring star Clark Gable is an idol extremely worshiped by women all over the world, as well as the leading actress Loretta Young and others. At the same time, the backdrop of the Arctic ice and snow and the introduction of wilderness life in the film are truly novel and exciting experiences for the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai that they have never experienced before. The left picture shows the two leading actors in the film.</p>
