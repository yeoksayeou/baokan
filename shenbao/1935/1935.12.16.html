<h3>英法建議意阿和平方案</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自墨索里尼大　侵阿不列顚帝國深恐危及本身利益乃領導國聯判定意大利爲侵略國繼又實施軍火財政經濟制裁英意關係遂呈一度緊張之狀然墨索里尼自瑪加爾攻陷後北路卽按兵不動此在一方面固有阿軍之英勇抵抗及瑪加爾以南地勢之不利進攻爲其主要原因在另一方面亦表示　不願侵及英國勢力範圍致與英帝國主義發生直接衝突賴伐爾乘此機會從中斡旋而英　妥恊遂促成矣</p>
<p>英意妥恊之具體結果卽日昨發表之和平建議方案此項方案除保留英法兩國在阿固有利益一點外實乃完全迎合墨索里尼之意旨而擬定者蓋依方案所規定東蒂格省及沃迦登達那基爾兩區完全割讓意國僅以阿國通海出路一隅爲交換而富饒之高原地帶亦以三分之一供意大利殖民開發所餘留者惟有關法國利益之鐵路區域及有關英國利益之藍尼羅河水源區域而已</p>
<p>此項和平建議倔强之阿皇雖至今尙未有接受之表示然在三强勢力壓迫之下恐終非屈服不可矣此則不僅在阿國爲可哀卽在全世界之弱小民族亦大可痛心也</p>
<p>何以言之蓋此項和平解决辦法實有一極嚴重之意義在卽鼓勵法西斯主義者之胃險精神是也夫墨索里尼破壞國聯盟的精神侵略未開化之阿比西尼亞方將受其應得之敎訓而正在宣揚正義人道之郝爾賴伐爾輩忽乃翻變態度甘以阿國之土地爲餌博取墨索里尼之歡心此非對于國際間具有侵略野心者之一種啟示乎今决意阿戰爭卽能以和平方式暫吿結束而因此誘發之未來國際戰爭恐將益趨慘烈矣</p>
<p>然世界弱小民族及列强國內民衆之同情于阿比西尼亞者於此和平方案亦可獲一重大敎訓卽帝國主義者僅能在保衛本身利益之限度內贊助被侵略民族而在原則上實乃同情于侵略行爲也當國聯官布意大利爲侵略國及通過制裁案時各弱小民族固深冀英法或能主持幾分正義者今則眞相已暴露矣國聯究不過爲英法帝國主義者之工具而已</p>

<h3>赤軍戰備狀況</h3>
<p>政治精神敎育極爲健全</p>
<p>東西國境俱能獨立作戰</p>
<p>華聯社特稿　伴同着蘇聯在經濟政治上建設之偉大的成功、蘇聯在軍備上、亦已有健全之準備、首先與一般資本主義國家不同的、就是蘇聯赤軍之精神的敎育、因爲赤軍之構成份　、百分之四玉·五是工人、至於農民成份之占百分之九十、又是集團農塲中的農民、所以它們表現着具有政治階層之意議　應該擔負其强化國防與研究生　技術之統一的任務、再者其中黨員及靑年團員的比重、又爲百分之四九·三、在聯隊長之間、黨員亦佔百分之七二、師團長間佔百分之九〇、並且聯隊長百分之一五以上、師團長及軍團長的百分之五〇以上、又爲國立各陸軍大學的畢業生、精神敎育之健全、可爲世界首屈一指、</p>
<p>再說到軍器及作戰方面、「化學國防首先爲國防協會及軍民各部所注重、例如改善空軍之量與質、在戰車隊及砲隊中、都增加了充實的化學威力、並訓練各種技術兵以優秀的化學戰識、</p>
<p>還應該指出那已經壓倒世界任何國家的空軍、自蘇聯第六决會到一九三一年、已增加了百分之三三的數量、而最近幾年來、並且將戰鬥機及轟炸機之速度指數、增加一倍半至兩倍、至於轟炸機續航距離與搭載量、差不多又增大了三倍、這樣遭受敵人高射砲及戰鬥機襲擊的可能、就更少了、且對於空軍之訓練、不但注意與海陸軍的各種恊同作戰、並注意着其單獨作戰的能力、</p>
<p>提到陸戰之新武器、機械化戰車在六决大會後、袖珍型戰車驟加二·四七五％、輕戰車增七六〇％中型戰車增七九二％、這是屬於量的方面、在質的方面、戰車速度亦增大三倍至六倍、尙有砲火方面、如步騎兵的機關槍數則增加了二倍以上、飛機及戰車隊的機關槍增加了七倍、戰車砲增加了四倍半、重砲也增加了二倍以上、舊式的槍砲早就掉換過了、</p>
<p>尙有軍事之連絡上、軍隊之無綫電化已逐步完成、自第六决大會後、無綫電局已增加一·七五〇％、航空無線電局增加一。九〇〇％、如欲發號施令、則止須把電紐按幾下就得了、</p>
<p>就是蘇聯海軍、也比第六次大會時加强了數倍、如以第六　、　會當時之海軍力爲一〇〇、則現今潛水艇已達五三五、海防艦達一一·一〇〇、魚雷達四七〇、而海岸之守備方面亦大有進步、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫說得好、「我們不得不增加赤軍的員額了」、所以現今蘇聯的常備軍、已由六十萬增加到一百萬、其他能够隨時動員的黨員工人等還不在內、而軍事預算在一九三四年度爲一·六六五百萬盧布、國防人民委員會的支出爲五億盧布、但在今年——一九三五年度、國防人民委員會的預算則已增至六十五億盧布、但其在國家總預算中所佔之百分率、却小於任何資本主義國家、</p>
<p>莫氏又在蘇聯第十七决黨大會中報吿說、「我們不僅對於刺多加湖至黑海的西部國境、而且對於遠東及東部西伯利亞最受威脅的地方、也構成了强固的要塞」、在一九三四年的時候、波羅的海黑海及遠東沿海的防禦工作、已經全部建成、不過自莫斯科至海參威間迢迢萬重的距離、運起兵火來、實在不便之極、所以一方面蘇聯積極圖交通上之連絡神速、擴大空軍、並且在遠東單獨組織成了獨立的遠東空軍戰車砲兵等單位的部隊、蘇聯在東亞及西歐兩方面的軍備、都有能够獨立作戰的能力、</p>
<p>至於蘇聯赤軍的指揮人材、如總參謀長耶戈洛夫氏、更可數爲世界唯一的軍事家、在他底五十誕辰、史丹林向他致祝詞曰、「予以布爾塞維克之敬禮、祝賀閣下五十誕辰、蓋閣下爲內戰期內卓越的軍事頒袖、爲南部及西前綫紅軍光輝勝利之組織者一人、爲紅軍參謀本部第一任參謀長、令敵喪心落膽、余祝君康健並祝君精力洋溢、爲吾紅軍而努力、以令敵人喪心落膽、余憶前此與君前線共事之際、深信閣下軍事知識與組織才能、將來必能爲吾祖國謀福利」云、無論從那一方面看、蘇聯赤軍的戰備、顯然有着飛躍的發展、况且從它底生產邁進的情形來推測、它底軍備實力還更有充實的可能、</p>
<h3>犧牲弱小迴護強暴　英法建議受各方責難</h3>

<h3>科學叢談　動物與人生</h3>
<p>— 秉志</p>
<p>近來國內學校，漸知科學敎育之重要，對於數學物理學化學等門，多肯竭力設備，廣攬人才，以敎授之，使學生從事肄習，可以饒有心得，此乃敎育事業上之一好現象，倘能照此方向，進行不懈，數學物理學化學三者，在國內當可發展日新，產生高深之專門人才，應國家社會之需用，動物學原屬博物學之一部分，向爲吾國敎育家所忽視，以此學所攻治者，爲虫魚鳥獸等物，恒以其無關實用，未嘗注意，於是此學在學校功課之中，或　闕如，或卽有之，亦不得與數理化三者，居於平等地位，此蓋由國人多不習此學，不知此學之關係，而敎育制度，乃有此根本之錯誤，其實此學之重要，不亞於任何科學，以其不徒與實用有關，其影響於人類之思想，亦甚大也。</p>
<p>與動物關係最爲顯明者，首推醫學，人卽動物之一，研究人體之病象，不能不藉各種動物，以作實騐，故習人體解剖者，必先習脊椎動物之比較解剖，而後其訓練方爲堅實，習人體生理人體病理及其他各課之關於醫術者，亦必習動物生理，以爲之基礎，且在人體生理病理之學課中，其藉用動物作實騐之處極多，蓋有甚多問題，不能就人體作實騐，故須用動物以爲實騐之資料，醫學如是，獸醫學需用動物學之處更多，醫學與獸醫學之關係民生，至爲遠大，乃由動物學爲之基礎也。</p>
<p>農業與動物，關係亦最爲密切，習農業者能言之，農業中如畜牧牛乳家禽等學，需動物學之知識與訓練，以爲入門之階梯，而昆虫學尤與作物園藝造林蠶桑等學，關係最深，吾人試就農業各門觀之，幾無一不需要昆虫學，昆虫學爲動物學之一部分，習昆虫學者，未有不需動物學之訓練者，魚業或水產學不能離乎動物學，水產之中，除魚類外，軟體類甲殼類之動物，甚有經濟之價値，此類之生活史，及地理上之分佈，當有專門研究，以爲獵取保存培植之資，浮生動物足以爲各種經濟水產之食，以助其蕃殖，亦需動物學者，從事調查</p>
<p>工業亦有需乎動物之處，各種動物之羽毛骨角筋皮等質，可以作紡織器裝飾器及各種用具者甚多，捕鯨事業之發展，以鯨油之用途甚廣，海狗之皮，可以製裘，鰵魚之肝，可以製油，昆虫可以產絲產蜜產蠟產膠及顏料等物，共餘各種動物，可以充食品，其體中各質，可用化學方法，提鍊成爲工藝原料者，亦指不勝屈，人類之衣食住之有需乎動物者，幾於觸目皆是。</p>
<p>醫學農學工業之有需乎動物，至爲顯明，實用之外，動物學之最値人注意者，則其與人生觀乃最有關係，蓋以各動物，瀰漫於宇宙之間，卽以最單簡者而論，其生活現象，往往與人生相彷彿，其較爲高等者，與人生尤相近，人有普通動物學之常識，善於借鑒反省，能由動物之生活，悟及個人之優點及缺陷，善者存之，又從而加勉焉，惡者戒之，努力以避去焉，不獨個人受共益，而人與人之關係，於是可以改善，社會之秩序，人羣之幸福，無不由是而增進，此學與敎育學心理學社會學政治歷史哲學等，無不發生關係者，卽以此故。</p>
<p>以上係就此學之功用而言，脫略罣漏之處尙多，不暇詳及也，以下請言動物之本身，吾人試就動物之演化觀之，最初者爲單細胞動物，所有各種功用，均由一單獨之細胞司理之，初無所謂神經系統也，稍進則動物之體質，乃由多數細胞構造而成，其中有所謂組織者，而神經之系統，與筋肉組織，或混而不分，或已可分析，其搆造仍極單簡，稍進則動物之體質，有較堅密之搆造，各種組織，較前者爲複雜，更由組織而搆成各種系統，此時動物體中之神經糸，已有神經結之出現，此外復有較大之幹枝，及各種橫連，神經之織維，達於體之各處，等而上之，動物有健全之組織，各種系統，愈形完整，神經系有數結，集聚而成腦部，其中實心而無腦腔，復由此有較大之幹枝，延至尾部，有數神經結分佈於此幹枝之上，其數與動物之體節，多相仿焉，此種搆造，復變而爲較高之型式，所有幹枝上之神經結，皆前趨集中於頭部，成一單獨之腦，其中仍無腦腔，自此之後，動物之演化愈高，所有動物，皆有脊索，脊索之背面，皆有一脊髓，脊髓之前端，卽是眞正之腦部，腦部之中，皆有腦腔，脊索動物之稍高等者，其腦率可分爲五部，魚類至於兩棲類，兩棲類至於爬虫類，爬虫類至於鳥類，鳥類至於哺乳類，其腦皆爲五部，在最前者，謂之前腦，卽是大腦，稍後謂之間腦，稍後謂之中腦，再後謂之後腦，又曰小腦，又後謂之延腦，皆生脊髓之前，至此則神經系統之發達，已甚完全，哺乳類之中，其位置愈高者，其前腦愈發達，入類之腦，其最前一部，特別發長，四處延伸，將其餘各部，幾皆掩覆，故大腦之名，卽因此而有，各種動物之高下，由各種形體判定，皆不若由神經系統判定之之爲較妥，爲極下等之原生動物，以至最高等之哺乳類，卽所謂人類者，由下而上所經過一切之階級，其神經發達之程度，頗足以代表其位置之高下也，動物之演化，其體中各質，皆有由簡單而複雜，由零碎而完整之趨向，然時有參差舛互之現象，卽位置較下者，其體中各質，偶有發達較甚，超乎高等動物所有者，故以之追索共進化之程途，不免有迂　崎嶇之憾，若以神經系統爲標準，則此困難可以免矣，以神經愈發達者，其演化愈高也，故動物學所治者，爲動物之一切生命現象，而動物之神經系統，要當爲首先注意之問題。</p>

<p>滬市財政　已入常軌</p>
<p>審計部上海審計處之成立、係經市長吳鐵城之建議、以冀本市財政得有系統之正軌、以符合預算與决算、自該處成立以來、首先對市府本身及所屬財政·社會·敎育·公安·土地·公用·工務·衛生等各局、暨其他附屬各機關之年度預算、均經審計處、對財政收入與支出、應增應减各項詳細審核後、財政已入常軌、本年預算决算可吿相符、</p>
<p>國營機關　逐步實施</p>
<p>本市審計處、現在工作、因時間淺暫、故祇以市府及所屬各局辦理審計、但審計處之任務與職權、等於監察、凡屬國民政府隸屬之各院部會駐滬郵政·電報·輪船·航政·儲匯·航空等等各機關之經費、收支之審核、該處刻正進行逐步實施中、使各個機關之預决算、獲有良好效果也、</p>
<p>推行稽察　制度工作</p>
<p>稽察制度、與審計情形稍有不同、一方面稽核各機關之經濟情况、一方面查察各機關對內對外營業買賣、如國營機關購買動用物件、不論其價格之大小、及招標購置材料與興建房屋等等、均須經過審計處之稽核查察、但因工作繁重、現尙從事計劃推行、將來此項制度實行後、斷言一切流弊曚蔽等情事、均可减除之云云、</p>

<h3>蔡增基再度闡述　土地改革政策之意義　重估地價流通地產救濟金融登記產權劃一測丈避免訴訟</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市財政局長兼土地局長蔡增基、前日赴西人「台維」及「希賢」宴於都城飯店、是日赴會者、計中西知名人士百數十人、蔡局長在席演講土地改革辦法頗詳、茲特譯述如下、「關於土地改革問題、最近已在各報登載不少、此種問題、値得金融界商界領袖及其他各界關心社會人士之注意、近來土地局建議土地改革、會引起社會人士許多興趣及批評、鄙人對此非常感激、各位知中國文化之進展、土地占有一重要地位、上海之富裕、大部份由於土地構成、有如非洲之金礦、與南洋羣島之橡皮業、現時尙無確實統計、惟信上海多數行商、及資產階級對於土地投資、成爲一重要財產、</p>
<p>外人投資　從前投於本市土地之一大部份資本、係由國內及國外雙方輸入、上海今日之繁榮、外人投資與有力焉、中國支付對外貿易入超之資金、其一大部份留存在上海、以爲土地投資、其他因國際貿易、由國外輸入中國之資金、亦爲土地投資、世界之不景氣、中國未能逃出圈外、而在此遠東最重要之城市尤甚、其造成不景氣之理由甚多、此間雖未便詳舉、惟地產業之不振、實爲造成今日不景氣之一重要原因、</p>
<p>地產價値飛漲　由不景氣而致金融緊縮、近年來上海各商業銀行之失敗者、亦因地產發生呆滯之牽累、在不景氣之前、各種信用放欵擴大、人人以地產投資及地產抵押爲最生利之事業、因此地價飛漲、建築事業加增、釀成地產買賣之踴躍、在此人造繁榮市塲之中、地產投資一變而爲投機事業、今日之經濟恐慌、與昔日之繁榮、成反比例、設使欲再達昔日之繁榮、非得恢復舊時地產投資之情勢不可、　　　　流通不動產　欲從事改革今日之弊病、惟有使地產暢爲流通、將土地價値從新估計，以公平之方法、將繁榮時代之過高地產價値、改定一眞正價値、並組織一金融公司、該公司之使命、能使現在各銀行所有地產抵押品、隨時得以貼現、因爲各銀行、目前不能再事放欵、以其地產抵押品充斥故也、（或與外國借債以貼現之地產抵押爲抵押品）、若能求得妥善辦法、將地產抵押品貼現、當可暫時救濟目前金融之奇緊也、</p>
<p>土地改革辦法　本局建議之地產抵押改革辦法、諒各位已有寓目、本局辦法、經呈送市府、轉呈國府、其要點爲本市內經測丈完畢、證明產權後、領有土地執業證之土地、或領有水租契之上地、其設定抵押權時、業經依上海市不動產抵押註冊規則、向土地局聲請註冊者、得依本辦法實行抵押權抵押權人於債權已屆淸償而未受償時得逕交拍賣行執行拍賣、或抵押事情有發生糾葛、可以向土地局裁判所告訴、在土地裁判所未成立以前、移送法庭處理、如必要時、抵押權人應提供相當之保證、　逕行實施拍賣之條件、</p>
<p>現行法律之缺點　關於執行抵押權、現在法律裁判手續、似有欠缺、本局之建議土地改革、務使現行土地制度、成爲合理化、以保護抵押人及抵押權人雙方利益、將來對於地契買主及土地證之登記手續、務取完備劃一、在目前永租契制度之下、當土地買賣轉移時、在領事館及土地局均無正式登記、至註冊業主之登記、其手續旣非完備、又乏劃一、殊非善制、各地產抵押、如能在土地局登記、將來對於眞正合法業主、庶免無足跡可尋、而對於以欺騙或不合法手續取得契據、來借欵者、亦可减少、如有業主發生遺失土地證、將來必有保障、其放欵之抵押權人、又不致與非法業主交易、因抵押旣經登記、則抵押人之爲合法業主、毫無疑義、將來抵押人、屆時不履行契的、淸償債務時、抵押權人、經行政機關核准後、即可自然逕將抵押品執行拍賣、</p>
<p>避免訴訟　若採用登記方法、則現在缺點、當能避免、而訴訟案件、亦可减少、除拍賣有爭執或抵押人之物權發生異議外、則不須經法院也、土地制度最完善者、當推托崙氏制度、該制度創於托崙爵土、首在奧洲頒行、後爲美國及其他各國取法、按該制度、土地契據、均由政府担保、舉凡各種轉移、如抵押批留置等、均須載入地契內、關於此制度、會有一作者、評謂、「土地須經註冊確定物權、凡各種轉移與留置、須詳爲記載、並經業主以註冊證、業主旣經登記、則物權即成鑄定、徵費須輕、辦理須速、方稱完善、」在土地執業證書中、此項制度之優點、多可引用、如永租契只有註冊業主、而無原業主者、亦可取法、一契之內、所有一切轉移、無不備載、其法甚善、故楚材晋用、於土地改革、不無借助焉、</p>
<p>測丈劃一　本人履新伊始、於各積習務求整理、如測丈方法、務與租界各當局所採行者相符、以前市政府與租界各當局之測丈互異者、今後當於各方合作力求改革、在研究土地問題當中、房東與房客問題、亦不能忽略、尤以最近會有减租鼓吹、此雖屬社會局範圍、與土地局無關、惟鄙人亦忝司財政、凡因租務影響、而可以間接妨碍市府稅收及租界收入者、用特指出、務求社會人士注意、各租界當局、當請市民之熱心公益與有聲譽者、組一委員會、專司研究房東與房客問題、及與此有關之法律問題、尙望諸君共匡不逮、共同策劃、使上海土地制度得臻完善、是不獨鄙人與土地局與有榮施、即全社會人士亦同沾福利也、」</p>

<h3>電器工業參觀記　——亞浦耳電器廠——</h3>
<p>— 婁立齊</p>
<p>近年以來、我國的電燈事業、很是發達、雖至窮鄉僻壤、也有使用電燈的、每年消耗燈泡的數量、頗爲可觀、在這許多被消耗的燈泡中、有一部份是從國外輸入的、如亞司令和飛利浦等、有一部份是國人自製的、如亞浦耳和華德等。</p>
<p>亞浦耳燈泡是亞浦耳電器廠的出品、亞浦耳電器廠、不但是我國製造電燈泡的鼻祖、且是以製造國貨燈泡爲主要事業的電器廠、它最初是由一德國人、名呌亞浦耳者所創辦、在上海倍開爾路租賃普通民房、設立工廠、專製電燈泡、規模很小、僅有工人數十人、故出品不多、銷路也不大、民國十四年四月一日、該德人以三萬元的代價、把廠中全部機器生財和原用亞浦耳商標賣給華人、乃改組爲股份有限公司、後來增資擴充、先在遼陽路購地十畝、自造廠房、添置機器、出品日多、銷路也日廣、於是復在楊樹浦路購地十多畝、建造最新式廠房、製造電風扇和電氣馬達、現在該廠資本已增加到五十萬元、雇有職工叫百餘人、由胡西園先生任總經理、莊仲文先生任經理、馮家錚先生任總工程師、主要出品、有風扇、馬達、與電燈泡三種、風扇分五十六寸吊扇、三十六寸吊扇及十六寸檯扇三種、馬達大至二匹馬力、小至十六分之一匹馬力、電燈泡則有長絲泡、可樂泡和氬氣泡二種、長絲泡泡內是眞空、燈絲長而且細、很易震斷、發光帶黃色、除窮鄕僻壤外、使用的一天天地少了、可樂泡泡內也是眞空、發光也帶黃色、惟燈絲粗而且短、不易震斷、較長絲泡爲經久耐而、祇因燈絲易於揮發、故玻璃殼內、很易發黑、這種燈泡的光度、以四十瓦特爲最高限度、過此就不經用、氬氣泡又呌做哈夫泡、泡內於抽盡了空氣以後、灌有氬氣和一些淡氣、這種燈泡、燈絲細短、繞成半圓形、因它的週圍有氬氣、故不特發光潔白、且不易揮發、玻璃殼內也不發黑、至於光度、則從四十瓦特以至數百數千瓦特、無不具備、該廠所產燈泡、也以這種的銷路爲最大。</p>
<p>日前、我們一行四人、雇車前往遼陽路該廠參觀、走進了廠門、就發見一塊長方形的籃球塲、塲的東首是工塲、南首是一座二層樓的辦事室、東首是接連幾幢平房、　者引我們入會客室後、我們細細地賞鑒全廠的建築、旣聽不到機器的怒吼、也看不見工人的忙碌、很是嫺靜、過了一會、該廠職員李君入室招待我們、李君首先簡單地把該廠歷史和內容告訴了我們、然後領導我們赴工塲參觀。</p>
<p>我們首先參觀玻璃部、這是製造燈泡應用的玻璃殼、玻璃便和玻璃管的處所、那裏有四座製造玻璃的溶爐、用磚和泥打成、半聳地上、半陷地下、溶爐裏面、有熊能的火燄、溶爐的四圍、有許多工人圍繞着、從事製造光怪陸離的玻璃器、據李君告訴我們說、這許多玻璃器的原料、女部份都用國貨礦砂、至顏色玻璃、由用一定的方式、配合化學原料而得的。</p>
<p>我們看完了玻璃部、再看燈泡部、燈泡部是一間寬大的廠房、燈泡全部各步製造手續、舉凡挿梗、黏絲、截管、排氣、封口、蓋印、駝光、較準、煉絲、等等、都在這寬大的廠房內完成的、那裏有男女工人數百人、都很忙碌地在做着不同的工作、機器百餘座、都不甚高大、最小的煉絲機、長僅尺餘、最大的排氣機、也不過容三人合抱罷了、各種機器、除煉絲、騐光、較準、蓋印機外、沒有一郁份不　帶煤氣的裝置、每一部機器、都裝有許多小小煤氣龍頭、噴射着均勻而柔和的火燄、藉這火燄來挿置玻梗、黏繫燈絲、截去餘的部份和排去玻殼裏的空氣等。</p>
<h3>試驗燈光程度及燈泡耐久力情形</h3>
<p>我們因時間匆、滯留在燈泡部中、為時不足三十分鐘、不能細觀察各部份工作的原理、這固是一件憾事、但我們已看見二種不尋常的設備、其一就是較凖輪、一個巨大的環輪不息地轉動着、環輪上的圓空中揷置製成的燈泡、隨着輪環的轉動、燈泡由無光而發光、始暗後明、終至熄滅、這座機器、是供校騐燈泡的磅數用的、每一隻燈泡都須經過校騐、假如製造不準確而磅數不足、那它跟着輪環、轉動到了一定的地位、就要破裂的、其　就是試騐燈光的程度和燈泡的耐久力的設備、在鄰接工塲的一間小室的中央放置一都棚架、中懸放光燈泡數枝、據李君告訴我們說、每一批燈泡製成後、須選擇幾隻、懸掛在那裏水遠放光不停、以試燈光的程度和燈泡的耐久力、這兩種設備是普通的燈泡廠所沒有的、在這商品競銷和不景氣的時期、該廠獨　比設備、替雇各謀便利、替本身增信用、這是亞浦耳的　色。</p>

<h3>小掌故</h3>
<p>— （柳思雋）</p>
<p>淸云亭山人孔尚任所著之桃花扇一書、曲之著名者也。書中述及妓女李香君赴盒子會事。所謂盒子會者、乃是「赴會之日、各携一副盒兒、都是鮮物異品、有海錯江瑤玉液瓊漿、」並且在會期中、「大家比較技藝、撥琴絃、笙簫嘹喨、」此等事、可謂雅矣。今日靑樓中、未聞有如此雅舉也。</p>
<p>昔意大利有羅伯德氏者、鑑於當時意之雄於資者、常以高利營貸出、貧民苦之、氏憤其殘酷、乃廣募基金於慈善家、創一機關、曰慈惠貸欵銀行、專以放資於貧民、不收利息、第受其擔保品。嘉惠貧民、當非淺鮮。吾謂今日我國之苦於「高利貸」者、當不在少、設有慈惠貸欵銀行者、則貧民將莫不額手稱慶矣。惜此種機關、早已失其本來之性質、在今日資本主義時代、自更無人能爲之創設矣。</p>
<h3>拇戰小掌故</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>拇戰、一名搳拳、通俗所行之酒令、兩人相對出手、各猜其所伸手指之數而合計之、以分勝負者也。辭源云：「五代史、史宏棨與蘇逢吉飲酒、酒令作手勢、殆即今搳奉所昉也。」近予偶讀明逸本陳留謝肇淛五雜俎、有云：「後漢諸將、相宴集爲手勢令。其法以手掌爲虎膺、指節爲松根、大指爲蹲鴟、食指爲鈎戟、中指爲玉柱、無名指爲潛虬、小指爲奇兵、腕爲三洛、五指爲奇峯。」則拇戰當始於後漢矣、又：「吳門袁君著有栂經、自負天下無對、然余未之見、惟德淸半月泉有行者、百發百中、人多疑有他術、然實無之也、惟記性高耳、能記其人十决以上、則縱橫意之無不中、所謂察形觀色、若辨盜者得之矣。」拇經今不知有存吾、坊間競刊珍本、大可羅致梓行也。</p>
<p>兩榜、三元、五魁、科舉名目也、然拇戰習呼之、殊覺陳腐俗套。曩年柳亞子顧悼秋輩、在梨花里組酒社、乃首創以詞牌名代之、蓋諸子皆詞人也。如一斛珠、雙雙燕、三妹媚、四時好、五綵結同心、六花飛、七娘子、八實妝、九張機、十樣花之類。其他鵲橋仙代　、龍山會代九、滿庭芳代十、然以呼不順口、動輒有誤、未能通行也。</p>
<p>里巷小兒有一種極簡單之拇戰法、握拳爲鎚、舒掌爲布、駢伸中食二指爲剪、布遇鎚、鎚爲布裹、鎚敗、鎚遇剪、剪爲鎚擊、剪敗、剪遇布、布為剪碎、布敗、且不須呼名、稱之曰東洋拳、未知是吾日本法、容待考之。</p>
<p>猶憶我吳星社、每逢雅集、輒於席間作捉曹操之令、各拈書蜀魏將名之紙捲一、掩覆之。由諸葛亮點將出戰、遇敵例必鬥、拇戰爲之、負者飲、直至捉得曹操始止。是較尋常拇戰爲有味。茲者雅集久虛、思之思之、夢寐系之矣</p>
<h3>跳舞小掌故</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>年來跳舞塲林立、一般時髦的公子姑娘和交際明星、那個不會踏着脚步、臉兒相偎、胸兒相貼的跳上幾跳、眞可說得懿歟盛哉！那知在三四十年前、我上海也舉行過一次很盛大的跳舞會、並且這一次創舉、還是官方發起、說來有些奇怪、事情是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>作者昨翻閱舊報紙、見「時務報」上、載有「上海蔡道台跳舞會記」一則、不覺奇甚。！特述之於後。</p>
<p>光緒二十三年十月初十日、禮拜六、（西歷一八九七年十一月四日）適值慈禧皇太后萬壽聖節、照例有慶祝之舉、蔡道台（按名鈞原著未列名）爲教陸邦交起見、於是以西禮敬西人、舉行一盛大的跳舞會、以應盛典、先期由蔡道台預發請柬六百份、遍邀各國領事、英法德各水師提督、曁中外紳商仕女、地址在靜安寺路洋務局行轅、是日行轅內外、懸明燈數千盞、及電氣燈無數、照耀得宛如白畫、攔杆及門上、均紮以各國旗幟及繡幔綵綢不等、跳舞塲設於後院、院後爲大客廳、備有豐盛的西餐以饗客、道台率同譯員鳳太守儀躬目招待、西賓或佩寶星、或戎裝介胄、或公服帶刀、躋躋蹌蹌、頗極一時之盛；並有西樂一班、由班首斐納帶領、席散後、即開始舉行跳舞會、共計二十决、賓主盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>董小宛埋香處</h3>
<p>— （俠虎）</p>
<p>澉浦南北湖、羣山環抱、外有大海、風景天然、遊湖者咸以小西湖目之。然興西湖相比、又是一種風光：海昌陳仲圭謂如虢國夫人蛾眉淡掃耳。兩湖並美浙江、各有短長、未可厚此而薄彼。</p>
<p>南北湖鷄籠山麓、有董小宛埋香處、崇禎甲申之變、冒辟疆携董小宛遁居鹽官、寓胡職方孝轅家、凡書冊器具、命董收貯。福王時召爲司李不就、移郭外大白居、又去至澉浦之惹山村、茅屋漁艇、或月一徙、或日一徙、卒於馬鞍山遇大兵、幸得一小舟飛渡、骨肉得全。相傳冒董居惹山時、嘗至南北湖遊釣、美人名士、輝映一時、小宛又嘗於湖畔葬落花、傳爲佳話。一說澉浦之北、淡水村之南、有慷慨橋、爲董之故居、冒避難惹山、以董之故居相近故、不爲無因、姑誌之以待通人之考證。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議處情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>其實問他們不問他們、那全沒有關係。我們夫人已經在這裏面大客廳裹請了許多女客開會、商量這一件事。北海一跳脚道：眞的嗎？那好極了。說着、他就不再和方大德說話、立刻掉轉身來、就向大客廳外向跑了去。只走到廊子下、就聽到有一位嬌滴滴的女人聲音、在那裏演說着。他說：我們站在婦女的立塲上、不能挽救這樣一個女子、那是我們的羞恥。無論如何、我們必定耍首先樹立女子的人格。要樹立女子的人格、又必定不讓女子做人家的玩物。北海聽着、覺得這位女賓說話、實在有勁、趕快的繞了個大彎子、繞到大客廳後面、伏在窗台上、隔了玻璃、向裏面看去。只見一張大餐桌子四週、全圍坐着女人。那個說話的女人、依然在人羣中站了起來。看他穿了那窄小腰身的棗紅綢旗袍、胸面前挺起了兩塊、屁股後面、撅起了一塊。曲綫美是非常之明顯的。這西安城裏雖然也有少數燙　的、可是那樣子、總是剪得非常之難看的。這位女士的頭髮却燙得很好、頂上平坦、在頭髮梢上、却曲捲了許多層雲鈎子。他的臉上、有很濃厚的胭脂粉、允其是有那嘴唇上、濃搽着胭脂膏。在這紅的嘴唇裏、發出聲音來。他繼續着道：女人被入家看成了玩物、原因雖很多、但是女人自己愛慕虛榮、甘心作人家的奴隸、這也是原因之一。要不然、男子們就能欺侮女子嗎？現在這位朱女士、就是這麼樣一個人、靠他自己跳出火坑來、那是小可能的。說着、托住面前的茶杯托子、三個指頭、作了蘭花手的形式、夾了茶杯的把子、送到紅嘴唇邊、呷了一口香茶、將杯子放下、然後又在衣襟下面、掏出一方花綢手絹來、兩手捧着、在嘴角上按了兩下、把茶漬擦乾。（三七七）</p>
<h3>海外小掌故</h3>
<p>— （佩萸）</p>
<p>英國文學家蕭伯納氏、在來華觀光的上一年、曾到過蘇俄去遊歷一次。這次的遊歷、他覺得格外的快活。有人研究他所以格外快活的原因、却得到一個很有趣的結果。原來有幾家著名的美國出版家、事前和他接洽、肯出八先令一個字的代價、收買他遊歷蘇俄所得印象的著作品。照普通出版物如比爾遜週刋等、每一縱行的字數計算起來、大概有六百五十字左右。那麼蕭氏每寫一縱行的文字、至少可得二百六十金鎊的酬報了。記得有一著名的美國編輯者、曾對一個要求一先令一個字的稿費的著作者、說過如下的話：一極少的著作者能得一先令一個字的稿費、假使每字的稿費在一先令以上的、那是更少了。」那麼蕭氏得八先令一個字的大稿費、可說在美國是空前了。</p>
<p>西班牙廢王阿爾方索、最喜歡豢養名種的犬類、在他亡命出奔的時候、曾遺下七頭紐芬蘭種的大狗。這些狗也知道受了深恩、不忘主人。主人失蹤之後、它們竟萬分憂鬱、甚至絕食待斃。一班臨時政府的重要官官員、怨恨廢王而連帶及於廢王的遺犬、主張以槍擊斃。但臨時政府的總統阿爾卡拉。瑞馬拉、獨持異識、他說要捉一頭去飼養、因此其他六個官員也同意、每人牽一頭去飼養、使它們漸漸忘掉從前豢養它們的主人。</p>
<h3>鬯遊澄江之吳稚老</h3>
<p>— 永采</p>
<p>革命先進吳稚暉先生、以黨國兀老、雅善詼諧。而生平允喜探景尋幽、徜徉於靑山綠水之間。近年來雖已德劭年高、童顏鶴髮、但是精神矍鑠、豪放不减當年、看他風塵僕僕、北往南來、探求民隱、要遊勝地、閒情逸致、花復不淺。所以誰都對他抱着歆羨和欽佩。</p>
<p>去春、吳氏曾抽暇到作者故鄕！江陰去遊覽過。這座沿江的古老縣城、經過名人的車輪足跡、當然增光不少。同時、以吳氏的幽默詼諧、却也遺留了不少雋聞在民間。不過、他當時的行踪旣極秘密、舉動又極平民化、除了當地幾個記者之外、外間絕鮮知道。大小各報、關於他那决在江陰撒下的趣聞逸事、也沒有片紙隻字記載過。作者偶憶及此、擷述一二、作爲掌故、料想吳氏見此文時、也必掀鬚莞爾的。</p>
<p>吳氏那次到江陰、事前並未預先通知、所以黨政團體、一概沒有知道。他在無錫早晨九時動身、乘鍚澄長途汽車到江陰、下車後、緩步進城。身着靑布罩衫、外加黑色對襟馬甲、手提包裹、行動完全是一位內地商人模樣。</p>
<p>江陰在吳氏的記憶中、並不是個生疎的地方。他少年時、和鈕永建、孫寒厓等、同在江陰城內中街的南齊書院裏長期的住讀過。（現改為南菁中學、吳氏是校董之一。）這次他到江陰、確也想順便瞧瞧少年攻讀的舊地、但結果來去匆匆、仍未如願以償。</p>
<p>他和江陰、旣有過一段悠久歷史、當然對於街道還依稀認識。可是、滄桑多變、在這數十年中、江陰也已另換一番景象了。吳氏進城以後、憑藉了他記憶中的路途而走、都是走些往年熱鬧、現在荒凉的冷街僻巷、想找爿館子用些早點、也無從找到。累了半天、詢問了過路人、才得着熱鬧街市的正確指示。</p>
<p>一位異鄕口音的人、在冷僻街巷中東奔西跑、極容易引起人們的注意、所以經過不久的時候、當他在飯館裹用午餐的常兒、就被記者們找到了。</p>
<p>他的一副尊容、極易使人認識。記者們知道他是中委吳稚老、都很彬彬有禮的投刺晋謁。他告訴訊者：此來是專程拜謁吳季子祠的。按季子是春秋時人。吳氏始祖、讓國多賢、載於史册。歿後葬於延陵、後裔復在墓旁建祠、即現在的江陰申港鄉。慕碑由孔子所書「有吳延陵季子之墓」八字、是江陰的一處名勝古跡。吳氏分屬後裔、性復好遊、此行當然含有相當的意義的。</p>
<p>吳氏未出飯館前、即囑記者們不必對外傳揚。旣出飯館後、又邀記者們一路陪伴他同去拜謁先賢墓祠、藉作嚮導。記者們都非常樂意地答應了。在記者們的本意、以爲得能追隨吳氏左右、當更能得到一些珍貴的新聞材料。那裹知道、這正是吳氏的幽默詭計、他邀記者們和他一路同往的目的、無非藉此隨時監視行動、使他們一時無從向外透露消息而已。</p>
<p>大家步行出城之後、即雇了幾乘洋車、一直向申港出發。到子目的地、大家掏出銀毫、搶着付車值。結果、還是由吳氏搶先的付過了。</p>
<p>拜謁過祠墓之後、他掏出鏡箱、和大家合攝一影、用誌紀念。其餘還攝了幾張風景片。各記者因來時匆匆被邀、都沒有隨身携帶鏡箱、所以除吳氏之外、並沒有誰更攝到這堪留紀念的一鱗半爪。</p>
<p>步行返城的當兒、吳氏飢腸轆轆、推己及人、他又請各記者在申港吃了一頓粗點心。席間、他笑着說：「自己雖是熒膺中委、委實是個窮光蛋。所以點心也祇能吃些粗貨。」說畢笑笑、掏出兩枚雙毫、會了這筆粗心的賬。吳氏此次來遊澄江、倒反處處作東、居於主人的地位、豈非怪事？</p>
<p>邑紳吳漱英、和黨政領袖、聞訊趕來晋謁、吳氏一行、已行抵西外汽車站了。當由吳漱英贈以澄江縣誌和碑帖數事、吳氏稍稍寒暄、即握手言別，乘車返錫而去。</p>

<h3>史高塔盃重賽結果東華三比一淘汰法商</h3>
<p>東華始終佔優但少精彩　法商最後奮門還報一球</p>
<p>東華與法商之史高塔杯賽、自上週在逸園賽成三比三和局後、昨日再度交鋒於申園、法商表演完全失常、前後衛中祇雷米狄可稱滿意、培爾其次、餘均平平、前鋒大華特缺席、小華特獨木難擋、餘子均不能克盡厥職、老將柯萊脫、原係虎將、去年退休以後、脚頭與氣力、均已生鏽、一無作爲、全隊如一盤散沙、東華之表演、雖未見生色、但以法商之不景氣陣容下、卒以三比一獲勝，觀者並不如理想之踴躍、祇五六千人耳、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<h3>戒懼過甚心慌意亂</h3>
<p>佈陣以後、法商開球先攻、賈幼良邊疆遞送、李義臣首先發難、無功而退、法商由雷米狄督師前進、法凡怯得球欲進被阻、交球雷米狄、雷挑送鬥去、柯萊脫小華特覓機攻鬥而不果、雙方踢來、均有手忙脚亂之弊、球路不淸、蓋勁敵當前、戒懼過甚、亦難免之現象、東華幾决進攻、幼良兩决射空、麟經依樣葫蘆、義臣偷渡營壘、近門欲射、又被雷米狄橫裹殺上救出、</p>
<h3>福將秋亭先開紀錄</h3>
<p>此後十分鐘內、球常在東華門前、法凡怯幾不能捉獲一球、失機甚多、偶得角球機會、亦未能如願送出、東華力守、法商雖全力進攻、一無展開之望、局勢甚爲沈悶、東華一股銳氣、似有發洩不出之勢、力道用足、球踢不遠、奔跑遲滯、進至中錢、取被截回、直至孫錦順溜出閘口、作孤軍奮鬥、雖未奏效、精神爲之一振、繼以雷米狄勃琪斯因脚下油滑、身不由主、失去控制能力、曹秋亭於無意間得球射門、竟開紀錄之端、時離開賽後之二十五分鐘、</p>
<h3>老孫鐵腿錦上添花</h3>
<p>相距五分鐘後、曹秋亭在邊界得球、因勃琪斯之反身不及、曹得從容逼近門側、交球義臣、此球十九可中、詛料義臣操之過急、冲天而去、法商反攻、無奈前鋒不能合作、法凡怯如同虛設、謨諾特曾有一决美麗之攻門、被徐亨擋駕、東華以曹秋亭之活躍、使東華前綫個個有活動機會、一决由曹之傳送、孫蹄順由後竄前怒射、應聲入網、美妙無比、東華乃得兩球、</p>
<h3>連中三元後顧無憂</h3>
<p>自此法商益見混亂、攻守一無可取、在此種情形之下、東華竟亦不能造就巨大之比數、易門再戰、形勢較爲激烈、買幼良之一射、曹秋亭之一頂、提起觀衆來精神不少、馬山兒死樣活氣、幾誤戎機、東華李關等將、對付庸弱之法商前鋒、綽有餘裕、李義臣靜極思動、得球猛衝、雷米狄隨後窮追、卒被義臣搗入巢穴、建功而回、法商幾度奮鬥、欲圖萬一之希望、但以柯萊脫之老弱無能、鮑休脫之浪漫不覊、而素稱能戰之小華特、亦爲同化、無能爲力、</p>
<h3>不屈不撓還報一球</h3>
<p>東華愈戰俞勇、英姿畢露、原因連獲三球、膽大心雄、無復他顧矣、法商仍極力圖攻、始終不懈、表示其不甘屈服之精神、後此十分鐘內、法商幾完全處於攻的地位、至時競爭最爲劇烈、雷米狄與培爾之進攻退守、使法商全隊增加生氣不少、以其不屈不撓，果由小抖亂鮑休晚如願以償、還報一球、此球之進、不誓爲法商打一嗎啡針、東華門前、頓成多事之秋、</p>
<h3>最後演出驚險萬狀</h3>
<p>最後五分鐘時、東華再度得機進攻、其勢汹湧、而法商抵抗防禦力量、亦較前用備、全局形勢、充滿興趣、似此最後之一刹那、欲予觀衆以美滿之眼福、而看台上之球客、亦聚精會神、情願貫注、幾忘其比賽之將終也、義臣得在敵門前罰球錢邊踢任意球、因力道太輕被救、而最後之二分鐘時、東華忽遭一决大難、徐亨救球被撞跌地、球落門前不到二尺、鮑休脫轉身蹴踢不及、在混亂情形中、東華卒避此危、顧法商果能獲得此球、亦不能挽回其不敗之結果矣、</p>
<h3>六比五反敗爲勝　優游擊敗西商</h3>
<p>優游二度屈居人後卒能死裹逃生</p>
<p>西商勇猛善戰侯活汀格爾允出色</p>
<p>西聯足球會甲組賽優游對西商、昨日下午三時交鋒於逸園、寒風凛冽、觀衆寥寥、優游因小黑炭陳鎭和足傷未出塲、實力大减、上半時以一比四告敗、下半時改變戰略、全軍用命、以五對一反敗爲勝、總結果六對五優游凱旋、</p>
<h3>劉始讚首開紀錄</h3>
<p>列陣對壘、西商先取攻勢、侯活撥球前進、陳鎭祥半途截下、輸運前方、許竟成統領三軍、浩浩蕩蕩、殺奔敵軍、幾度攻門、均未命中、西商汀格爾奮臂當先、與侯活一搭一擋、長傳短逸、聯袂迫入優游腹地、侯活提起毛腿、矢如雷電、張榮才不慌不忙、候個正着、未遭毒手、優游度過難關、全軍奮發、許竟成逼成角球、王南珍開來恰到好處、鍾勇森暗放冷箭、球中麥克勞彈回、劉怡讚從人叢中衝出、舉脚猛射、紀錄遂開、</p>
<h3>優游隊連失四城</h3>
<p>西商失利後、全軍忿火中燒、個個怒髮冲冠、磨拳擦掌、抱雪恥雄心、侯活運球前敵、勢如風捲殘葉、銳不可當、時在優游門前興風作浪、侯活臥地一掃球滾入網角、西商氣熖萬丈、汀格爾得侯活之派司、連闖三壘、再建一功、侯活看見眼紅、再來一只、急得優游諸將面無人色、何奈梁樹棠賣力過甚、腿部受傷、優游門前敵踪四佈、險象環生、汀格爾命射又中、優游勇森竟成　祥之將暗通欵曲、直達敵門、惜三箭均未達目的、殊爲可惜、上半時優游遂以一對四屈居人下、</p>
<h3>陳領隊密授機宜</h3>
<p>檸檬過後、易地再决勝負、優游已抱破釜沉舟之心、領隊陳邵臨陣密授機宜、乃更動大批人馬、梁樹棠出任左內鋒、劉始讚改任右前衛、鍾勇森亦與育祥對調、局勢變更、前鋒五將相繼用命、王南珍起義邊疆、許竟成暗中協助、勢如破竹、西商連失防錢、王南珍飛起一脚、建功而返、從此聲勢稍振、但因操之過急、致有幾决良機、屢屢錯過、然優游並不氣餒、鍾勇森脚下撥動、王南珍鍾育祥聯袂攻打、麥克勞心慌意亂、觸犯法規、判罰十二碼、許竟成拉起一脚、直入網心、鍾勇森殺得興起、深入虎穴、翻身一下、又中鵠的、造成和局、</p>
<h3>優游隊死裹逃生</h3>
<p>優游此時已戰得人困馬疲、故西商仍縱描無敵、幸張榮才高檔低欄、救出險球不少、俄而球由海特萊短遞給奧爾、轉傳給侯話、畢竟大將風度、的是不凡、臥地掃射、榮才大驚失色、已挽救不及、西商乃再度佔先、優游不得不作因獸之鬥、勇森南珍雙管齊下、同時逼入西商腹地、勇森舉脚力射、應聲入網、惜竟成趨位、此球被罰作廢、王南珍東山再起、由底綫傳球中央、梁樹業拔起傷腿、忍痛趕上、果然命中、當此緊急關頭、小鬍子雲逢　特別賣力、殺開一條血路、傳干梁樹棠、一脚飛起、又告命中、俄而時間已至、優游以一球之差、死裏逃生、反敗爲勝、殊爲不易、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（二）（三）</h3>
<p>— Louiaa　M.Alcott　原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>蜀夫人看見那個孩子辛苦的收獲，那晚經過許多的折磨還自爲她珍護着，不禁感從中來，於是驀地抱她的童子起來，開始哭了，那麼溫和，却又那麼的痛切，他竟瞿然驚醒，而且似乎愕然不知所以。可是一瞬間他已恍然記得，於是緊緊地抱持着她，帶著勝利的微笑說道：</p>
<p>「我知道你會來的。啊媽爾媽爾！我真望你啊！」於是他們倆吻着，抱着，簡直忘了身外的一切；因爲游蕩子無論怎樣迷失，汚穢，疲乏，一到母親們的懷中，她們總饒恕過他們的，快樂呀那個兒子，他對於他母親的　托心是始終不變的，並且他雖然經過許多顛沛流離，還保存着一些孝敬的紀念物在報答她仁勇的慈情。</p>
<p>同時唐恩將南恩從她藏身的矮樹叢裹起了出來，居然也能很和柔地溫慰她忽然醒來時的驚　，拭去她的眼淚；因爲南恩也因歡樂之極而致放聲大哭，在她所視爲不知經歷若干世紀的寂寞蒼凉以後，忽然見了一個慈和的臉兒，並且覺得一個强壯的臂膀圍着她，那是多麼好呀。</p>

<h3>願合作事業向漁業界推進</h3>
<p>— 屈若搴</p>
<p>合作社事業在農村中，最近已得有相當基礎，合作事業的研究者以及實行者尚在積極的圖謀如何向農村中廣範圍的推進？如何促進合作社的效能？以負起救濟破產農村的責任、在政府方面，實業部添設了合作司，全國經濟委員會設立了合作事業委員會，蓋以行政的力量督促合作事業的進行，更以經濟的力量，舉辦有利全國經濟的合作事業，如此的雙管齊下，不是更足以表現合作社事業的一日千里麼？但是他的對象爲農村，然而亟待救濟而改善的漁業，依然爲各方所忽視。比較其他的經濟建設，還是相去天壤。近來不常是見到聽到漁村的破產漁民的呼請救濟麼？然而一般所認爲救濟國民經濟重心的合作事業，也不想推行到漁業方面。歸結一句，魚村是在崩潰的階段中，尚沒有得着救星。</p>
<p>漁業何以始終被人忽視而日趨於破產呢？何以救濟農業的工作是日益高漲的進展，而不救濟漁業呢？事實上漁業本身比較農是有困難之點的。普通說來：農業方面雖也受到天災，可是比海洋中的突變，當然少得多；並且在土地上，我們祗要放下種子，勤於耕作灌漑，可以固定的看到它的成長，以至於收獲，而在漁業方面，海洋中的魚類，很多因爲水流的變向，影響到水溫水質，或者發生暴風雨，多可以使它不能生存在原有漁塲，以致漁民一無收穫；進一步言，農業經濟的存在，的確比漁業有把握，因爲農業者有耕作地的土地所有權（佃農僱農固然沒有土地所有權，但是所謂經營農業者，大都必在有了土地之後），並所有土地上生產物收穫之所有權；至於漁業則在公共水面的漁塲上捕魚，所希望的收穫物—水產物，任何人捕獲後皆可以爲已有的。因此企業界很少對於漁業投資，銀行界更因爲漁民缺少有形擔保，如漁船漁其等遠不及農民的土地，房產等穩固，不敢放欺與漁民。在這種情形下，救濟漁業，似乎就有「欲進不前」的狀况。雖然，漁業眞是小足以開發的麼？吾國不需要漁業麼？中國漁業沒有開發的可能麼？要說明了這三個問題，然後可以討論如何復興吾國的漁業？以及漁業界如何的需要着合作事業的推行。</p>
<p>關於第一個問題，已可說用不到怎樣的說明，眼前的事　，海洋河沼中有着無盡量的寳藏，任何水產生物除去食用以外，尚可製造各種吾人所需要的工藝品，於是决不仟其貨棄於水而不加採捕。於是就不得不發展漁業；而亦現代的國家中，凡是沿海的，沒有一國不是注重漁業，日本即是最好一個榜樣，她的漁業生產成爲經濟生產的重要之一項，而漁民亦占了各業人口的第三位。這不是漁業大可開發麼？至於第二第三問題，也是很容易了解，中國不是擁有七千餘里的海岸錢麼？而且沿海儘有可與世界產魚區域匹敵的漁塲，不是擁有很豐當的生產麼？於是吾國就需要漁業，也即是有發展可能的漁業。再吾國漁業已有久遠之歷史，全有數百萬的漁民，民衆有復食水產品的習慣，那末如何可不需要漁業，如何可放棄漁業？再在一般的經濟方面言，如不開發漁業，那末國家經濟就少了一部份的生產收入；同時因爲本國沒有水產品的供給，不得不盡量購買舶來水產品，又增多了國民經濟的支出；同時原在漁業界工作的份子，即成爲廣大的失業羣，又將影響到社會安寗；關於此點，在目前吾國的現狀中，因爲不注意到漁業的發展，已很顯露的有這種現象，外海海盜的增多，不單是搶漁船，騎刦商輪；騷擾漁村，而逐漸的到較內地帶搶刦了，日前報載八月十七日海盜竟入樂淸縣屬的白象小學，綁去師生數十人，這巳是很明顯的事實，而海盜增多的原因，不能說不是外海漁民因於生計來幹道種營生，並且也證明外海漁村已無可搶刦了，才使海盜向較內地帶來發展，這如何可不振興漁業，和安定漁村呢！何况沿海漁業對於國防上也有一部份的關係吧！</p>
<p>吾人看到上述的幾點，實可以感覺到吾國是不可以不注意到漁業，更不可以不努力復興漁業的工作！，那末如何來復興漁業？關於問題的原則，已沒有討論的必要了。方法呢！合作事業可以救濟破產的農村，而不能同樣救濟漁業麼？若能推行合作社到漁業中去，俾有堅固的經濟組織，則於漁業前途是萬分有益的。至此吾人乃抱十一萬分的熱望於全國合作事業委員會，能撥出一部份的經費（報載將以一千萬元促進合作事業）就漁業中各業，分別組織合作社，像上海的新式漁輸業以缺乏合作性，現在已有幾艘停業，並有全部破產之說。但是很有幾家是獲利的，如果能各輸合作，即可節省無謂開支，又可增多收入，像烟台威海衛青島一帶的漁輸組織「華北漁輪業運銷消費保儲金保險有限責任合作社」成績很好，足見這是很可以實行的。但是上海漁輪業聽說負債很多，所以希望合作事業委員會能予以經濟上的帮助，成立此項合作社。此外像舊式漁業中的幾項重要漁業也可先行促成其組織合作社，像大對網漁業，溜網漁業，台州小對漁業等擁有大帮漁船的重要漁業，先行組織起來，現在浙江沈家門的大對漁業，巳在籌組大對漁業運銷消費信用兼營合作社，正在請求政府借欵促成，聞已得相常頭緒，這些多是希望能早日實現的。在實業部合作司方面，對於全國各漁業有一系統的合作社之計劃，以便在漁業上也有一個統制的機能。同時更應注意到漁村合作社的組成，因爲漁村合作社對各項漁業的合作社略有不同，前者是以一漁村爲單位以包括該村中的各較小的漁業，而後者是以一漁業爲單位，凡是附近各地相同性質漁業者俱可連而爲一的。再後吾人對各地的漁會希望全國各漁政主管當局促進它健全起來，因爲它一方面可以促成漁業合作社的成立，同時對漁業前途更有帮助開發的效能。</p>
<h3>山東漁業之現狀及其改進</h3>
<p>— 丁逢白</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>年來國人多高談國民經濟的建設運動，但對於水產經濟一部內，則大多忽視。他們不明白水產經濟（又名漁業經濟）是國民經濟之一因子，亦即是構成國民經濟之一環。所以水產經濟之興盛與吾，足以彩響於國民經濟之榮枯。因之水產經濟之重要性，在整個的國民經濟當中，其地位亦不可謂不大。</p>
<p>我國沿海七省，有二十七萬方里之漁塲，每年平均計有四萬萬元之漁利；（註一）山東在我國沿海七省中，爲一個主要的產魚區域，據最近調查佔計所得，我國沿海七省的水產經濟之生產價値，有如下表：河北省二、〇四一、四〇〇兀山東省五、八七二、五〇〇兀江蘇省四、二八七、八〇〇兀浙江省六、六九〇、八〇〇兀福建省九、八七一、四〇〇元廣東省一四、九一四、二〇〇元合計五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元（註二）</p>
<p>以全國沿海七省產魚區域而論，山東一省的生產價値就達了五，八七二，五〇○元，在總的生產價値五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇當中，他所占的生產價値也爲數不小。以七省經營漁業的資本而論，山東經營漁業的資本，在七省當中實則堪稱第一位。茲將中國現在的漁業資本，估計如下表：（註三）</p>
<p>觀上表，可知山東的漁船價格爲七，三八一，〇〇○兀，漁具價格爲七三八，一〇〇元，資本總額爲八，一一九，一〇○元，其中任何一項經營漁業的資本，都較其餘六省爲多。如果這個統計是比較精確和可靠的話，則不言而喻的我們可推知山東省實爲我國牛要的漁塲之一了。考山東沿海產漁之區，共計有十八縣，北自棣起，南至日照止，其面積不下二千餘里，一般捕魚爲生之民衆，計紙有數十萬人之多，海產之種類，當然以魚爲大宗，每年鹽魚一項的產量，也就異常驚人。在山東產魚區域的十八縣當中，又以龍口烟台威海威靑島……等處爲代表，本文所收集的一些統計村料，也大半是限於這幾處的。</p>
<p>註一：見水產月刊第一卷第七八兩期合刋的弁言</p>
<p>註二：見同刊同卷同期中國漁業經濟的地位一文的統計</p>
<p>註三；見實業統計第一卷內之報告</p>
<p>山東魚產的概况</p>
<p>山東魚產的概况，一時尚無確切的統計，就國內報章雜誌所載，多爲斷簡殘篇，語焉不詳，國人對於漁業經濟之忽視，於此可見一般。山東的魚產，其捕獲的方法，以使用的網類不同，的計可分下列八種：</p>
<p>（一）掛網捕獲。此網爲中國特有，在山東一帶沿海捕魚，最多使用，計每船得使用二十餘網，故操作極爲便利。山東全省的有二千餘網，專任沿海捕捉雜魚及蝦之用，漁期爲二月至六月間，漁塲范岡，則自大麥島而至沙子口沿岸一帶，魚獲物每船的値銀三百元左右。</p>
<p>（二）圓網捕獲。此網主用於捕帶魚，靑島附近的計有八百餘，一船乘漁夫六七人，地點多在水靈島竹盆島及大小公島近海，每船魚獲額達一二百餘元。</p>
<p>（三）流網捕獲。此網主使用於捕　鰣鯖……等，使用之漁船的有百隻，船積載量的四十石左右，可乘漁夫四五人，漁塲在塔連島及大公島一帶，漁期自三月至五月，每船魚獲額計達五百元。</p>
<p>（四）曳網捕獲。此網專使用於捕　及雜魚；在一漁期內每船平均的有三百餘元魚獲價値。</p>
<p>（五）元網捕獲。此即圓網之小者，主用於捕烏賊及雜魚，漁塲多在海湾內及沿海淺處，漁期爲三月至六月，計每船可獲得銀一百五十元。</p>
<p>（六）張網捕獲。此網專使用捕捉龍蝦之用，漁期爲三月至十月，此種漁船，普通稱爲燕尾船。</p>
<p>（七）風網捕獲。此二種網主使用於山東北部沿海一帶，爲捕捉黃花魚之用，漁船的有三百隻，每年的有三百萬元之魚獲額，漁期爲三月至五月，惟最盛時僅中間十七八日而已</p>
<p>（八）大網捕獲。此網主使用於烟台沿海一帶，多用以捕捉雜魚。</p>
<p>山東每年魚產的總量究爲若干？我們旣然無法去統計，該省建設廳對於此項漁業經濟的調查，叉無詳細的報告可供參考，我們只好根據國內的報章雜誌上所載，對於山東十八縣中主要的兩大產魚區域——威海衛和靑島加以調查。</p>
<p>關於威海衛魚產的槪况，我們可以從威海衛魚獲物的銷售數量及價值上考查：</p>
<p>威海衛魚獲物行銷數量及價値表（註四）</p>
<p>總計威海衛魚產常年所銷售的斤數共爲一九，六五六，〇〇〇斤，其價值總量則爲七八五，二四〇元；但這還是指的已經銷售了的斤數而言，其實際獲魚的總數量，當然還不止此。再看威海衛實際上捕魚的數量表，就可以知道其魚產數量之一般。</p>
<p>威海衛獲魚的數量表（註五）</p>
<p>上表已經把威海衛各村的魚獲數量，說明了一個大概，且確已可證明威海衛魚產的數量之大。</p>
<p>靑島，也是山東產魚的主要區域，凡魯省在黃海以南東海以北一帶之產魚地，均以靑島爲大宗，茲將靑島市漁業公司一年內成交的魚類斤數表，列舉如下：</p>
<p>靑島市漁業公司一年內成交魚類斤數表</p>
<p>靑島市全年的魚產成交量，共計爲四，〇〇三，三七六斤，這是單以靑島的膠州湾一帶而言，而全年實際的產量，當然還不止此。若以靑島出口的魚類數量來計算，據膠海關最近三年魚類出口的數量，作表如下：（數量係以單位担百斤計（註七）</p>
<p>威海衛和靑島，從上面各表中，可以證明牠是山東的兩大漁塲，因爲從渤海到黃海一帶的漁業，都以威海衛爲大宗；而從黃海到東海一帶的漁業，則以靑島爲中心區域了。</p>

<p>註七：民國二十三年天津大公報九月七日所載，表係經作者改編過的。</p>
<p>山東漁業貿易的現狀</p>
<p>山東的漁業貿易，在過去尚稱不惡，進自近年外國海產物之輸入，逐年增加，故我國海產物之銷售量即逐年减少，魚價日益低落　使我國漁業前途，達到異常危殆的地步。由東的潐業貿易，允在日趨下降，特別是自去年七月新稅則施行後，水產品之輸入激增，我魯省尚是舊式漁業居多，在生產上又復不能與外貨相伯仲；更加以外有日輪的壓迫，內受海盜的騷擾，苛捐雜稅的剝削，因而更一落千丈，不可收拾。即使有少數新式漁業，又因缺乏資本，不能有大規模的企圖，在此種新　都同陷於困頓之際，行見山東省的水產市塲，將全數爲舶來品所侵佔。這主要的原因，常然是由於山東的漁業未加以整頓和改良，以致故步自封，爲人排斥。但决要的原因，我們又不能不說是這是由於新稅則所給予山東漁業的一大打擊。</p>
<p>（註八）查新稅則之實行，對於海產品如介魚……等稅率實行减低，招來了日本海產品的大量輸入，因之魚價大跌，共影響於山東漁業貿易者的有三端。</p>
<p>因外貸傾銷，魚價低落，使山東漁業更陷於危境。</p>
<p>舊式漁業，叉因魚獲不豐，形成魚賤傷漁。</p>
<p>新式漁業消耗浩大，魚獲物銷路日蹙。又兼日人對我市塲之爭奪不遺餘力，使我山東沿海一帶之漁業，幾全部爲日人所把持。</p>
<p>回顧新稅則未施行前的情形，我們引用兩個進出口貨貿易的統計表，即可明白了。</p>
<p>民國廿二年山東水產物出口價値統計表（註九）</p>
<p>據上表所載，計山東三區魚塲之輸出口岸價値總額，計爲二二四，二○〇元，若以同年的進口價値相比，可知山東漁業經濟的對外貿易原已達到了如何可憐的地步。</p>
<p>民國廿二年山東水產物進口價値統計表（註十）</p>
<p>總計山東叫區進口水產物質値總額爲八五六，叫六二金單位兀，與出口額二二四，二〇〇兀相較，相差何止五六倍。又在出口貨的價値統計表中沒有龍口在內，是困爲把龍口的出口貨的數額，計算在烟台區域以內。總觀以上所引的兩表，出口貨的價値是如此小得可憐；而入貨的價值，又是如何的大得可怕！水產經濟　外貿易的低洛和不振，這很明白地告訴了我們：山東的整個漁業經濟乃至於全省的經濟組織，同時步入到破敗衰頹的地步了。</p>

<p>在「翳學故事之十二」中，我曾經說過：產科學是醫學中比較最後發達的一個部門。不信，請看下列關於分娩的迷信的種種傳說與故事。</p>
<p>我們知道，未來的孩子的性別，是由染色體决定的；但在這學說發明以前，民間對於孕婦腹中的孩子的性別往往用各種迷信的方法去猜測。在十六世紀的德國，流行着一種風俗，就是把小麥與大麥同時浸在孕婦的尿中，然後把牠們同時下種。假如小麥先出，則未來的孩子是男的；大麥先出，則是女的。在法國西南部，孕婦常把一枚銀幣擲過肩頭；假如銀幣正面落地，則男兒可望。又，從孕婦的右乳擠下一滴乳汁或血液，滴入盛淸水的玻璃杯中，看牠或沈或轉，以决定孩子的性別。</p>
<p>鵝的糞，鹿角的碎片，及象牙的末屑，都是療治不孕症的藥劑。在羅馬，當每年舉行節日饗宴的時侯，僧人拿鞭子相互打擊；假如一個不孕的婦人伸出手去而被鞭子擊中，那就她不久可以受孕了。</p>
<p>孕婦的胃慾，是應給予滿足的——這也是一種迷信。在勒夫（Jack　Ruff）所作的書上，載着一個故事，可以替這傳說作瞪據。故事的大意是這樣：</p>
<p>一個孕婦打麪包店門前走過，看到一個麪包師裸着上半身站在爐前。她突然感到一種不可抑制的慾望，耍想從麪包師的肩上咬一塊肉喫。她明知道這是辦不到的事情，只好接速幾天在麪包店門前徘徊，別的東西一點也不喫，而且沮喪得很。這情形給她的丈夫知道了；他用盡方法勸她進食，終是無效。她說，除非她咬一口那麪包師的肩上的肉，她再也不要喫別的東西了。於是丈夫走到麪包師那里，給予他一這欵項，要求　讓地咬兩口。可是，常她咬第三口的時候，麪包師因爲忍不住痛，退縮了。後來，那婦人生下三個孩子，兩個活的，一個死的。</p>
<p>關於母體感應的故事是很多的。在愛爾蘭，假如嬰孩有痣，可以用一片胎盤把牠擦去？在法國，孕婦不能做敎母，吾則她的孩子會變成一個「聾啞」。</p>
<p>在西班牙，常產婦　痛開始的時候，假如她溜倒在丈夫的褲子上，則難產可以避免。要是分娩緩慢，產婆就拿一塊熱的鐵板按在產婦的腹部，用拳頭敲擊鐵板。更好的方法是用鴿子的乾糞搽擦產婦的腹部。</p>
<p>在許多地方，分娩完畢，產婦卽起身料理家事，而丈夫却上床休息幾天，有時竟達數星期之久。這風俗被稱爲Couarde-意思就是「男子代替婦人睡憩。」</p>
<p>卽使在目前的開明社會，關於分娩的迷信的風俗亦不勝枚舉。例如：對於孕婦的胸惡，玉蜀黍是一種有效的治療劑；假如一個行經的婦人接觸受孕的牝馬，那牝馬就會流產；行經的婦人不能料理牛乳，吾則牛乳立卽變酸；她不能製果醬，吾則果醬立卽變硬：假如母親在懷孕期間患胃弱症，嬰孩一定頭髮很多：假如丈夫在新婚之夜不脫鞋子上床去睡，則第一個孩子一定是男的；假如孕婦多喫落花果，孩子多半是女的：假如孕婦把摸弄自己的面頰成爲習慣，則生下的孩子面部有痣；產後流血，把斧放在床下就會止住；婦入產後第一决走下步梯，應向後退；假如嬰孩痙攣，可用鹽放在他的掌中；嬰孩出生第一年中，不應剪除指甲與趾甲，吾則他耍做賊。</p>
<p>這些故事，不但使我們感到興味，並且使我們明瞭產科學爲什麼遲遲發達的緣故。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七十六）膽石症　Cholelithiasis</p>
<p>問　膽石症是什麼病？</p>
<p>答　是膽囊內，間或肝臟內和膽道內發生結石的病。</p>
<p>問　這種結石的成分是什麼？</p>
<p>答　膽石的成分，大都是從膽脂（Cholesterin）膽色素石灰（Bilirubinkalk）構成的。</p>
<p>問　膽石的大小，有一定的嗎？</p>
<p>答　大小不一，小的從粉末狀起，有些像留針頭大小，到豌豆大小；大的有像鷄蛋大的。</p>
<p>問　生成膽石的塊數，有一定的嗎？</p>
<p>答　也不一定，少的一個，多的有數百個。</p>
<p>問　膽石的形狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　形狀跟着發生的部位和數目而不同。生在膽囊內的面祗有一個的時候，成球狀或橢圓狀。生多數的時候，則成多角形。表面粗糙；但若和他石相對合的一面，却扁平滑澤。存於膽管內的又呈樹枝狀。</p>
<p>間　膽石的顏色怎樣？</p>
<p>答　不定。關於膽汁色素的含量而變異。從膽脂構成的，差不多呈白色；從膽色素石灰而成的，呈褐色。最多的是混合構成的，呈金黃綠色，或帶赤暗褐色。</p>
<p>問　硬度和比重怎樣？</p>
<p>答　硬度也關於構成的化學成分而異。含石灰較多的硬固；含新鮮的膽脂的則柔較而可用兩指壓扁的。比重，較水爲輕，所以可以浮在水面。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>問　膽石症的發生和年齡和性別有無關係。</p>
<p>答　四十歲以上的人居多，女子較多。</p>
<p>間　和體質有無關係？</p>
<p>答　很有關係，凡患痛風，糖尿病，肥胖病動脈硬化症，風濕痺，饑餓或食脂肪物肉類過多，及飲酒等都有容易發生膽石的傾向。</p>
<p>問　誘發膽石的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>答　凡可以使膽汁鬱積的事情，全是誘發膽石的原因。像肛門部瘉着，寄生蟲，腫瘍，異物，膽管淋巴腺腫，肝硬變和膽管炎等都是。</p>
<p>問　鄰部的器官和日常生活上影響到膽石症的發生的是什麼？</p>
<p>答　膈膜的呼吸運動障碍和膽管的壓迫，腹部的絞窄，姙娠，常習坐業者或長時臥褥等，都可爲發生膽生症的原因。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十三）咽喉異物</p>
<p>咽喉異物，多由口腔進入而成。異物進入的時侯。常與食物誤嚥。咽頭異物，大都滯留於口蓋扁桃腺，舌根扁桃腺，舌會厭窩及梨子狀　。有時可以停滯於食道入口部。講到異物的種類。要算魚骨爲最多。决爲果核，玩具片，竹片，金屬片，貨幣，針，及釘等類。魚骨，果核，及竹片的成爲咽頭異物。多由飮食不愼而起。玩具片，金屬片，及貨幣。則以小兒玩弄時，塞入口內。以致誤入咽頭的時侯爲最多。牠的中要症候。就是患者訴告咽頭部發生異物感覺及高度的嚥下疼痛。往往異物雖可自然排除。但是從牠的創面。依舊可以發生刺戟性的疼痛。因此每每引起患者憂慮異物的尙未排除。有時在受創的部位。發生浮腫。這種浮腫，常可阻碍異物的摘出。由咽頭異物所生的創面。屢可惹起續發性的創傷傳染。此時患者感覺劇烈的嚥下疼痛，壓痛，發熱，腫脹，及發赤。腫脹有時波及外頸部。或者竟可釀成膿瘍。咽頭異物最妥的治療方法。卽由醫師確定異物滯留的部位後。於喉頭鏡的照射下。使用鉗子或鑷子摘出卽愈。若有續發性的創傷傳染。則治療較難。且常危險。</p>
<p>喉頭若一旦進入異物。通常卽可由反射性的咳嗽發作。而自然咳出。這是爲喉頭所特有的一種防禦異物的機能。所以我們在食飯的時候。若有米粒誤入喉頭。則頓可發作咳嗽。須至米粒咳出。咳嗽方止。這是一種很明顯的事實證明。不過異物若大，或爲尖形。則能嵌留於喉頭。而呈劇烈的呼吸困難。小形的異物。屢可通過聲門。而達氣管或氣管枝。以致惹起肺炎症狀及相當的呼吸因難。喉頭異物確實的診斷。莫如應用愛克司光的透照。若在呼吸困難著明的時侯。則當先行氣管切開。以救吸呼。然後再爲設法取出異物。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（十三）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第七一問）牙髓充血的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）牙髓充血，可以說是牙髓炎的初期，但尙未到眞正發炎地步。遇見冷熱，感覺酸痛。若早爲治療，可以痊愈，牙髓可以保全</p>
<p>（第七二問）牙髓炎的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）牙髓充血，若不加治療，漸變爲牙髓炎。一切刺激，都能惹起劇痛。痛的時間較久。就是沒有刺激的時侯，也會覺痛。有時候疼痛能放散到牙齒周圍的各部。牙髓到了發炎地步，若欲保全，頗爲費力。大槪多趨於壞死一途。</p>
<p>（第七三問）壞死的牙髓，留在髓室內，有什麼危險？</p>
<p>（答）經過發炎而壞死的牙髓，若任其留在，極易化膿。有時侯立刻化膿。有時候經過長時期，方纔化膿。當壤疽化膿的時候，產生臭氣。若是在不開放的或是出口極小的髓室內，就會脹痛異常，非把膿汚臭氣放開不止。而此時膿毒極易穿出牙根端孔。牙根膜受其傳染而成爲化膿性牙根膜炎。牙根端部發生膿瘡。破壞局部的組織，影響全身的健康，而成爲一箇可慮的傳染病灶。蛀牙所引起的禍害，至此爲極。在下節講到傳染性牙根膜炎時，還要詳細論及。尋常一般患者，在牙髓炎劇痛的時侯，則急於求醫。及至牙髓壞死，疼痛停北，自以爲病患已消滅，復怡然不以爲意，不再求醫治，一任禍根隱伏，至將來發爲劇害。</p>
<p>第二節　牙根膜炎</p>
<p>（第七四問）什麼叫做牙根膜炎？</p>
<p>（答）就是上面第五二問內所說的包圍在牙脚外面這層薄膜，受了傳染或是受了刺激，充血發炎，甚至化膿。我們所最怕的牙痛，差不多都是從牙根膜炎和上節所講的牙髓疾患而來的。</p>
<p>（第七五問）牙根膜炎大槪可分爲幾類？</p>
<p>（答）大槪可依其原因，分爲傳染性（卽化膿性）和非傳染性兩大類。傳染性的症候較重，醫治也較難。</p>
<p>（第七六問）傳染性牙根膜炎的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）傳染性牙根膜炎，多係由上節所講的爲蛀牙所引起的牙髓疾患而來的。牙髓壞死化膿後，膿毒通出牙根端，以致牙根膜受其傳染，發炎化膿，漸被破壞。周圍牙床骨，亦多被破壞化膿，成爲齒槽膿瘡（Alveolar　Abscess）。起初破壞部分，多限於牙根端部周圍組織。</p>
<p>（第七七問）非傳染性牙根膜炎是什麼原因？</p>
<p>（答）大槪由於下列的原因而發：　藥物的刺激，如局部治療所用之砒劑石炭酸等的刺激，內服藥水銀鉛鉀等的中毒。　器械的刺激，如硬傷齒石食屑的刺激，裝鑲的假牙齒和牙根管充塡物的刺激。這種牙根膜炎，往往在牙根管治療時或牙根管充塡後發生。因爲並不由於微菌的傳染，所以謂之非傳染性。但發生後，往往易染病菌而致化膿，變爲傳染性牙根膜炎。</p>
<p>（第七八問）一切牙根膜炎大槪都有什麼症象？</p>
<p>（答）牙根膜充血增厚。局部牙肉變深紅色。患牙覺得高起，鬆動浮脹，輕敲或輕觸卽痛，咀嚼困難。此爲牙根膜炎（無論傳染性或非傳染性）所特有，而爲他症所無。</p>
<p>（第七九問）牙根膜炎的疼痛，和牙髓炎的怎樣別分？</p>
<p>（答）牙髓炎的疼痛，是放散性，病者往往不能指出患牙。牙根膜炎是限局性，疼痛限於患部。而且牙根膜富有觸覺，稍加敲壓，卽能察知患牙。</p>
<p>（第八十問）傳染性牙根膜炎最顯明的症候是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）傳染性牙根膜炎有急性慢性兩種。急性的症候，爲腫痛迅速增加，一二日後，患部牙肉高起，蓄膿澎漲，作跳搏狀痛。患牙極爲高起鬆動，一觸卽痛不可忍，因此不敢咬合。而且遇熟物亦增劇痛。患者全身違和，眠食不安，常有微熱。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（七）（八）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>開　金製劑的用法，是和鐵勃固靈狠類似的，就是：最初用極小的分量，爵後按次緩緩增加，末後可增加至數十倍以上（和第一次比較）。但本症患者對於金屬劑的適應情形，是人人不同的此外，金屬劑是狠多發現局部全身反應的，如果反應太劇烈了，十和病症本身不無損害的！所以每次注射之前後，對於病者一般狀態，溫度，脈膊，食慾，以及血球沉降的遲速，尿便之詳細檢查，發疹之又無，腹瀉之發生與否，這種種，都應該鄭重注意絲毫不苟的……對於每一次注射分量之增加與否一定要詳知病者上次注射後種種情形，方可决定；决不是一成不變的。所以醫者行使此種洽療，也應該獨具隻眼，十分小心從事，方能無遺憾的。</p>
<p>對於金屬劑適應的範圍，不妨也在此連帶一述。關於他對喉結核之功效，在前面已經講過了。他在肺結核一方面，最初是僅限於慢性一型式的，現在纔知道不然了，對於滲出性型式也是很適應的，就是帶進行性（不過分利害的）和溫度增高也無妨。在此種時際，他有時可補鐵勃固靈之所不及，和手術療法，也不以並行而不悖的。對於皮膚結核方面的狼瘡成效，更不可磨滅。但對於腸結核腎臟結核；以及這二方面的合併症，則屬禁忌之列的！</p>
<p>此外，在樑用金製劑以前，有一部分人是狠提倡銅製劑的，但現在臨床方面，已狠少有人採用了！最近又有一部分人主張用製劑，但這還在試騐時期，臨床上還未被採用。</p>
<p>（乙）肉桂酸他在過去的一度時期，曾採作普通刺激療法的，現在已咸有提及了。但愛爾邦藥片（肉桂酸製劑）之應用於高熱方面，在臨床上是很習見的。</p>
<p>（丙）矽酸劑矽酸之應用於肺結核症，在歐洲民間是早已家喻戶曉了，但正式採用於臨床一方面，乃係最近幾年的事。他們根據的理由是：凡人獸體中之結締組織，均以矽酸爲重要成分。肺結核病灶之停止進行，完全係周圍發生結締組織的緣故；這裏面含有　酸成分是特多的。那末，爲本病病灶停止進行結痂起見，矽酸劑之應用，當然是很適當的了！他對於本症任何一種型式，都沒有什麼禁忌的，就是在行使他種治療方法的時際，也可以常用無碍的。對於本症的一般症象，像咳嗽，食慾不佳，溫度增高，等情；矽酸劑之應用，也時見良好之效果的！</p>
<p>（丁）鈣鹽這是一種最普遍而爲大部分醫家所樂用的，幾乎是「無病不肺癆，無癆不用鈣了！他的學理上根據究竟何在呢？我們曉得，大凡本病的病灶，如果現石灰性硬化了，是一種很可樂觀的現象，因爲他完全係藉此而漸轉愈的：就是在舊結核性病灶瘢痕裏面，也有石灰狀遺物之存在的：尋常多呼吸石灰石膏粉末之工人，又不大會罹結核症的。凡此種種，都足以證明石灰和本症之關係匪淺鮮的。石灰爲鈣質之結合；所以鈣鹽之對於本症，也成爲治療方面不可缺少之劑了！這是一個最重要的目的。此外，鈣劑係兼有止血，消炎，及抑止滲出諸作用的；鈣質又爲人身重要細胞之基本質；所以他在臨床上應用之範圍，是非常廣闊的。</p>
<p>關於鈣質的製劑，也多如雨後春筍，指不勝屈的；最習見的係葡萄糖和鈣之合併劑，經過靜脈注射手續收入人體的。因爲葡萄糖溶液係有增加營養利尿解毒諸作用的，對於本症治療上，更加未得適應。他對於本症任何一種型式，大槪都沒有什麼禁忌的。他除開對病灶本身促進石灰化外，對於本症的一般症象，像高熱，食慾缺乏，咳血，等情：都有優良之成績的。</p>
<p>（戊）木焦油此種藥劑，係久已口碑載道的，在最初應用於本症的時候，一般人都當作特效藥的；這當然是不對的。但對於亢進食慾袪痰之效果，確是無可吾認的。惟其味極不佳，對於胃腸不康健之病者，以及有咳血之傾向者，係不宜輕用。對於腎臟部分，也不無刺激作用，所以尿便檢查之工作，是不可忽略的。關於這一類製劑，也是不勝枚舉的，某廠的含幾怪怕勒托，數年前是紅極一時的，現在已咸有人介紹和稱道了！其實用木焦油丸劑，效果完全一樣的何必浪擲無數之金錢呢！</p>

<p>電信特刊</p>
<h3>兩年來之本刊</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>日月不居，歲聿云暮，二十四年光陰，將於此十數日內盡之矣。此一年來電信業務整理之成績若何？進展之程度若何？亟須加以檢查，以資策勵。關於此點，已另有文報告不贅。本刊自二十二年十二月發行至今，已閱兩週年，此兩週年中，本刊對於電信事業之介紹若何？對於社會人士之貢獻又若何？實值得吾人討論者也。</p>
<p>本刊宗旨，厥為「電信公開」，開宗明義，已在第一期發行時標此一題，至今守不渝，良以電信為民眾通信之利器，苟不公諸社會得其同情，而獲其援助，雖有鉅萬資產與眾多人才，對於事業前途，鮮少發展。何則？閉門造車，出數合轍，供求不須，不合經濟原理故也。是為政者一方面應將事業本身充實健全，以應社會之需要，同時應將事業實在狀況，僅量公開，而得社會之贊同，私營事業，且賴招徠，況國營事業乎？</p>
<p>本刊之主旨，即在公開，惟公開要義，在於忠實，苟不忠實，何貴公開？兩年來同人對於此點，謹慎將事，凡關於電信消息，均根據事實，加以探討與闡明，始敢發表。苟非正確消息，雖新穎動人，決不採用。反之，未來事實之消息，如三年計劃五年計劃等，雖正確亦不登載。蓋本刊目的，「在公開事實」，不尚「公開言傳」，良以為政不在多言，事實勝於雄辯也。</p>
<p>兩年以來，電信事業內容是否充實？本身是否健全？吾人誠不敢以自滿，作肯定之答復。然以兩年前之情況與現今比較若何？現今民眾印象與兩年前者又若何？此社會人士自有月旦，亦無待曉曉者也。惟吾人引以自慰者，即本刊藉上海申報一角之地，　為公園，凡申報所及之各處，本刊隨之流傳，是本刊之通信範圍，本隨時增廣：計截至第一週年日，本社收到各處來函，共八百三十七件，截至今日，已逾二千件，申報發行數額，截至第一週年日，計十萬份，截至今日已逾十五萬份，是申報之銷行愈廣，即本刊介紹之機會愈多，而得民眾之同情亦愈深矣。</p>
<p>上述民眾之同情，非可一蹴而得也。須有真憑實據之事實，開誠布公之態度，將電信事業內部情況，和盤托出，使民眾瞭然於過去之成跡，現今情形，與將來趨勢，而知電政當局施政之方針。同時瞭然於電信事業之功用，引起利用電信，興趣，從而貢獻意見與能力，以備政府之採擇與運用。故本刊使命，一方面將政府政策，宣達於民眾，民眾意見，呈獻於政府，另一方面以本刊立場，將政府與民眾意見，加以調整，而策進行。惟上項工作，其主要條件，端在於各方面之通力合作。兩年以來，本刊頗承社會人士所關懷，深為榮幸。嗣後希望隨時見教，傳電信事業，日趨發展。此又同人區區之意也。</p>
<p>憶去年一週年時，本刊以申報副刊發行之故，保存不便，讀者要求編為單行本，以供參考。為答副雅意起見，曾將第一期至二十五期文字，擇尤分類編印「電信特刊　刊第一集，」不一月而銷售殆盡。嗣後奉接讀者來函，要求編印第二集者甚眾，茲擬將第二十六期至五十期文字照樣編成，以資紀念。出版日期，容當續告。</p>
<h3>兩年來電信與公眾關係調整之種種</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>歐美各國電信事　與公眾之間，聯絡極為密切。凡有新興設施，必先利用新奇廣告，廣為宣傳，以期家喻戶曉。後徵集公眾之批評，收集　廣益之效。共事業之發達，有由來矣。吾國電信事業，創辦迄今，垂五十餘年，業務狀況，迄米昌盛，雖其故多端，而平時與公眾間缺乏一種必要之聯　工作，亦為主因。返數年來，交通當局有鑒及斯，殫精竭力，從事於公眾關係之調整。兩年以來，關於此事之種種設施，有足述者，略舉於次，以饗國人；</p>
<p>一，電信刊物之發行　夫電信設施，時有改進，法規章則，常多頒佈，欲使此種新的規章與設施宣達於眾，裨知所利用也，必須利用出版物為之介，於是首先有本刊之發行。其後接踵而起者，有天津大公報之「電信特刊」，青島民報之「電信雙週刊」，以及烟台東海日報之「電信」等。各該報紙均為當地之大報，而申報大公報尤稱報業之丘壁，宣傳力量，異乎尋常，其有裨於公眾電信常識之提髙，自無疑義。</p>
<p>二，業務稽查員之設置　電信業務，頗為繁複，收發報人與電話用戶每有　　明瞭之處，若不詳予解釋，每因之發生種種誤會。且電局方面，業務上之缺陷，手續上之錯誤，往往難免，顧無傳達之機會，則一方徒生觖望之心，一方仍無改進之望。交部有　及此，特　各局設置業務稽查員，專司稽查報話業務之責。每日親赴各　行，機關，團體，報館，　通信社等處．查詢或宣傳各項報話事項。公眾對於電信業務有未明瞭者，因此得有詢問之機會，其有不滿意情　者，均得有相當之答復。如此電局信譽，因之提髙，公眾意旨，賴以溝通，誠互利之道也。</p>
<p>三，電信常識之廣播　除上述兩項外，交部尚有「電信常識播音宣傳辦法」之頒告。凡當地已設廣播電　各處之　報局及電話局，均須辦理此事．其目的在灌輸公眾通信當識，其內容約包括下列各項：　各項報話業務規章之闡明，及其價目　收費或省費力法之講解：　便利通信之各項新設施，及新添局所之報告；　講述利用　　之利益，及收音機登記之勸告，並答復公眾常向電局問訊之事項。凡此種種，省籍播音之力，收宣傳之效。裝有收音機諸君，於飽聆娛樂節目之餘，兼獲電信常識之機會矣。</p>
<p>四，電信影片及幻燈片之製映　交通部為使公眾了解電報電話通信之真相起見，曾委託中央宣傳委員會往上海各電信機關，攝製電信教育影片一　，將有無綫電及電話等機械及工作情形，一一攝入。並加配有聲說明，解釋各種電信機械之原理，及處理手續經過，俾觀眾於數十分鍾內獲得電氣通信之概念。現已攝製完竣，不久即可公開放映。此外並製成美麗悅目字句簡明之幻燈片多　，在各地電影院放映，藉以宣傳各項新興業務。</p>
<p>以上諸端，係舉其犖犖大者。他如編登　信新聞，刊載業務廣告，散發宣傳小冊。以及設置電話問訊　，以便公眾，開放電信機關，任人參觀，均為調整公眾關係之要圖，而為交通當局所注意實行者也。惟是所陳，尚係電信事業與民眾密切聯絡之造端，發揚光大，有待於今後之努力也！</p>
<h3>一年來電局組織上之改革</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>最近一年來電政當局為謀發展電信事業起見，對於電局組織方面，有重大之改革，茲特申述如次：</p>
<p>電報局台合併之完成：交通部自上年五月及十月間將上海．南京．北平．天津．漢口等五處電報局及無綫電總台實行合併後，一律稱為電報局，並規定組織系統，於局長下設總工程師一人，主持有無線電技術事項，其下分設報務．營業．工務．事務四課，詳細規定職掌事項，俾課與課之間，對於主管事項，各自負責辦理。實行之後，成效卓然！繼之合併者，有廈門．福州．青島．巴縣．成都．濟南．張家口．鄭縣．宜昌．南昌．萬縣．貴陽．長安．長沙．烟台．歸綏．蘭州．甯夏等十八處，均已自本年四月一日起實行．除廈門．福州．青島．巴縣等五局之組織大致與南京等局相彷外，其餘各局規模均比較緊縮，僅於局長之下設工程師一人，主持技術事項，業務長一人主持報務營業事項。全國各電報局台自上年五月起開始辦理合併以來，迄今僅歷年餘，均已合併完竣，從此有無線電均　屬於同一機關，其組織系統較前健全合理，不僅有無綫電聯絡傳　收發，可以增進速率；且於管理方面，亦能集中事權，指揮便利也。</p>
<p>裁撤長途電話管理處　查江蘇．安徽．山東．河南．河北等五省區，交通部均設有長途電話，並設立長途電話管理處管理之。所有各省區以內之報話營業處代辦處，及各電報局內附設之長途電話營業處，關於調度話綫.裝置機械.　訂價目．考核人員．稽核帳冊．及核發話費收據等事項，均由長途電話管理處辦理．因此在各該省區內之電報局及報話營業處代辦處，並不　屬於同一管理機關，須受電政管理局及長途電話管理處之雙重管理，事權既難集中，指揮又欠靈便。現交通部已令飭裁撤，所有一切長途電話事務移併電政管理局辦理。嗣後，各電政管理局對於轄區以內之電報局及報話營業處代辦處以及長途電話營業處，均可統一指揮監督，以收指臂之效。</p>
<p>裁撤電報幹綫工務處　各地重要電報幹綫及長途電話話綫之測勘．建築．修養．維持．改良．擴充．以及材料經費之支配等事項，向由電報幹綫工務處管理之（如前滬漢工務處等）。惟各電政管理局內亦有工務課之設置，主管本區電報綫及長途話綫之上述事項。往往同一省區以內之電報綫或長途話綫，竟分為幹綫支綫兩種名目，事權不一，影響工程匪淺！上年交通部舉行電政會議時會有裁撤電報幹綫工務處之決議案，現已令　施行。所有關於電報線及長途話線之修養。維持等事項一律歸併電政管理局主持辦理。</p>
<p>實行報話合併　電報電話均為民眾通信之重要工具，又同屬國營事業，殊有打成一片之必要。我國各大城鎮設有電話局者，大都均已設有電報局。交通部為便利管理起見，最近一年內已將吳縣．鎮江．蕪湖．江都．清苑．九江．蚌埠．沙市．鄭縣．洛陽．威海衛．榆次．南昌．安陽．龍口．宜昌．潼關．東台．蘭州．成都．銅山．貴陽等二十二處之電報局及電話局先後實行合併，仍稱為電報局。在任務為兼營電報電話。其餘首都．天津．武漢．北平．青島．烟台等電話局規模宏大，一時尚難實行合併。又聞長安（即西安）新浦。灌雲.大同等處電報局內，亦將添設市內電話，以利通信。</p>
<p>除上述各項重要改革外，其他關於充實各電政管理局之職權一事，亦推行頗力。最近曾通令各電局遇有請欵或請示事項，應先呈由主管電政管理局核轉，不得越級逕呈交通部，俾各電政管理局可以實施管理職權。此項功令，無非增加行政效率，與統一指揮。實係組織上一種重要設施也。</p>
<h3>王先生過年</h3>
<h3>一年來之電報業務</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>記者於去年十二月一日會為本刊草擬「一年來之電報業務」一交，略述一年中電報業務改進之概況，藉供社會人士之參考。韶光迅駛，又屆殘　，過去一年中電報業務之進展又何若？當為有識人士所亟欲探悉者，爰仿舊例，再述本年中電報業務改進之概況，以實本刊。</p>
<p>一、電報機械設備之改進　語云：「工欲善其事，必先利其器，」電報機械設備之完善與否，自與通信效率影響甚鉅，本年中關於機械方面之改進者，有鍵盤盤孔機之改為大小打攻用式及克利特印字機改為適合華文四碼小打電報之用，俱為增進電報速率有價值之發明，記者會於本刊為文化述其原理與功用，尤為最近電信界對於改進機械榮譽的貢獻。又因本年中全國局壹實行合併後，有無綫電報務之聯絡，益臻密切，各大繁局報房內，復均添置輸送報底空氣管及拉送器等設備，使電報　送之手續　儘量以機械替代人工．其他報務頗繁各局，次第採用韋氏收報機，以減少　應，加裝分派凝電器，以增速率，均為改進電報機械設備之犖犖大者。</p>
<p>二、電路之調度與擴展　自有無綫電合併組織以後，交部為發展雙方合作效率起見，特訂定全國無綫電機會晤時間表，減少有無綫電重複之電路，並增加遠距離通信之會晤時間，俾充分發展無綫電通信之功能，同時對於官公通電及列有數個收報地名之電報，復規定通電路由　，分發各局，使避免有無綫電傳　之重複。至本年中有綫電方面，有下列各重要電路之添設：</p>
<p>巴縣成都直達　竿城間向祇有單綫一條，　敗不堪，自經交部整理後，已於五月十六日改用快機通報嫌容量過小，交部因特就巴蓉話桿加掛報綫一條，開放雙工通報，已於九月六日正式接通工作。</p>
<p>巴縣貴陽直達　竿貴直達，本祇無綫電可通，嗣以該地報務上之需要，收興設綫路，於本年六月成立通報。</p>
<p>貴陽長沙直達　湘黔有綫電直達，亦為本年中偉大建設之一，該路因距離過遠，故在洪江局裝設幫電已於五月二十二日正式通報。</p>
<p>貴陽昆明直達　黔滇有綫電直達之成功，尚為電政史上之創舉，盡貴昆兩地，不特距離遙遠，工程浩大，且山路崎嶇，設綫困難。然卒賴當局之主持與各方之努力，已於十一月十六日正式成立通報。</p>
<p>蘭州哈密直達　蘭州哈密，均為西北繁盛之區，來往電報，向由酒泉接轉，迂緩特甚，交部有鑒於此，特在酒泉局設置幫電，於六月十八日正式開放哈蘭直達工作之將來發往新省電報，當更形迅速矣。</p>
<p>三、編印電報局名簿　現行之電報局名簿，尚係民國二十年出版，陳舊不堪適用，益以近年來各地電報局，報話營業處，代辦處及無綫電　等增設頗多，而各地地名亦有變更，亟須　行續訂，以應需要。　於本月上旬出版發行。</p>
<p>、編訂國內電報營業通則　查關於國內電報之收發辦法，交部先後公佈之法令甚多，自電報收費新章實行以來，更形繁複，不特收發報人，不易明瞭，即電局人員亦難於記憶，交部為調整公眾與電局之關係並溶冶各種收發規章於一爐起見，將編訂國內電報營業通則一種，公佈施行，從此收發報人與電局之關係，即有菜守之準繩，當可減少種種無謂之糾紛矣。</p>
<p>五、明密電碼新編再版發行　交部於二十二年八月間刊行之明密電碼新編，銷售甚速，故於本年中又將內容大加刷新，再版發行。該編內容，除將前次改良各點悉予保留外，並增時電政便　內究有電政大事年表及電政現狀述要等，以供各界之參考。</p>
<p>六、繪印電報綫路圖　近年來電報綫路之調度與增設，頗形頻繁，交部為使各電局明瞭電報綫路之敷設狀況起見，特於本年二月間繪製電報綫路圖，分發各局應用，聞最近各省電報綫路之支配，變更甚多，又將再版印行，以應需要云。</p>
<p>以上各端，僅就記者所知，略述梗概，自不能概括交部本年中全部電報業務之情形，然亦可窺我國電報業務進展之一斑矣。</p>
<h3>一年來之電話業務</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>交通部主辦之電話事業，近年以來，大有長足之進展。作者於本刊第二十六期曾作有「一年來之電話業務」，將去年電話業務改革之成績，略為闡述，以供社會人士之參考。流光如駛，斯時又閱一年，此一年中，電話業務關於便利民眾之點若何？整頓業務之點又若何？檢閱過去，推騐來茲，爰將犖犖大者縷述如左：</p>
<p>（甲）關於便利民眾方面</p>
<p>規定津滬話局用戶利用電話傳發電報辦法　交通部為推廣報話聯絡利用，俾民眾得有更大之通信便利，特訂定電話局用戶利用電話傳發電報辦法一種，飭由天津上海兩報局自本年三月起試行。按該項辦法，電報局裝置電話兩具，專供接收電話用戶所發電報之用，凡電話用戶如欲拍發電報，毌庸預存報費，亦毌庸向局方登記，即可撥叫電報局指定專用之電話，將電報傳交拍發，至所需報費，於月底彙總結算，由電話局代向用戶收取。</p>
<p>取銷京滬長途電話保證金　查市內電話用戶如欲在自用話機上接通長途電話，向須預繳保證金，以為長途話費之保證。該項辦法，在未繳保證金之用戶，即不能充分享受市內電話與長途電話聯絡利用之便利。茲為改善起見，特先在京滬兩處，予以取銷。</p>
<p>試辦電話局答復用戶詢問當地事務　交通部各電話局為供用戶詢問電話號碼之用，均有理事台之設置，茲為便利民眾計，特訂定電話局答復電話用戶詢問當地各種事務辦法，擴充理事台之職務，伙兼辦答復下列各項詢問事宜：　市內電話租費及長途電話通話地點及價目，　國內外電報通報地點及價目，　國內外郵件通達地點及寄費郵資，　郵電局每日營業時間，　標準時刻，　當地發生火警地點，　火車輸船及長途汽車開行時刻及價目，　各娛樂場所當日節目及時間。</p>
<p>訂定郵局代售公用電話簡則　此項簡則，規定凡通商大埠代售電報之郵局，經當地電報局及電話局之委託，應代售公用電話，惟代售範圍以去話為限。長途電話，以普通通話為限，其代售時間，以郵局對外辦公鍾點為準，蓋於便利民眾之中，仍期郵電業務之進展也。</p>
<p>推行車站裝設公用電話　關於車站裝設公用電話，經上海報電局及上海蘇皖郵政管理局，分別與路局訂定京滬滬杭甬兩路沿綫各車站供給公用電話地位暫行辦法。規定兩路沿綫各地，凡交通部直轄之電話局，及交通部核准之省辦市辦電話局，或商辦電話公司，均可商准路局由當地車站供給相當地位，以為話局設置公用電話零售處之用。</p>
<p>長途通話免費銷號　复照長途電話營業通則，發話人掛號後，臨時請求撤銷者，須繳一次通話費三分之一之銷號費。惟關於發話人守候時間之限度，尚未規定。茲特規定發話人掛號後，如因話務繁忙線路擁塞普通通話守候至四小時，加急通話守候至二小時仍未通話者，即得聲請免費銷號。</p>
<p>長途電話夜間減價　交通部為疏勻長途話務並發展夜間業務起見，特依照各國空閑時間通話減價收費之先例，訂定長途電話夜間減價辦法，凡長途普通通話及普通加急通話在每日下午八時至次日上午六時之間者，概照日間價目七折計算。此項時間，不以掛號為準，而以雙方用戶開始通話之時為準。</p>
<p>（乙）關於整頓業務方面</p>
<p>訂定電話局收費辦法　查各電話局收費辦法，至不一律，且多欠妥，　訂定電話局向用戶收費辦法一種，規定各電話局應視當地情形劃分為若干區域，並於每月一日至十日之期間，分　指定某一日為某一區之收費日期，屆時電話局派員携帶收據，挨戶收取，如未能依期清繳者，電話局於期滿後之第三日，先以電話催　一次，第五日即以停止通話，再逾七日，仍未清繳者，即予銷號　機，所有欠費在保證金內扣除，不足仍須追繳。自此項辦法實行後，各局每月份應收話費，均能收到，且從前所有欠費，按月均能清償一部份云。</p>
<p>推廣電信業務稽查　業務稽查辦法實行以來，頗著成效，惟該項辦法祇行於通商大埠，且所查詢事項，以報　為限，範圍未能普遍。茲特訂定電　　務稽資員兼查電話業務辦法，指定上海南京等十二處，電報局之業務稽查員負稽查當地電話局業務之責。所有稽查員對於用戶方面及話局業務方面，應稽查之事項，均一一詳予規定。</p>
<p>規定市內電話營業通則　交通部所屬各電話局，前均各訂有營業章程，辦法紛歧，內容簡陋，亟應詳加　定，以資一律。惟各地經濟狀況，自不相同，各局機械設備，亦非一律，應於統一辦法之中，仍寓各局伸縮之意。經交通部先將各局現行章程，加以研究，　根據各局現行制度，酌量各地情形，並參考歐美成規，制定營業通則一種，於二十四年七月一日起實行。</p>
<p>推行長途通話三分鍾制　各地長途電話每次通話時間，有採用三分鍾制五分鍾制兩種，殊多不便。為謀國內國際通話時間之統一，認為有普遍採用三分鍾制之必要。爰於去年年底令飭各省長途電話管理機關，先行依照三分鍾標準，重行擬訂各地通話價目，並經一一核定。該項新辦法，山東，河北，江西，福建，四區，已於本年四月實行，而蘇皖兩區，亦於本年九十兩月分別實行。</p>
<p>取締各話局免費電話　查各電話局職員，每多裝用免費電話，消耗工料，佔用號碼，有碍營業。又局用電話在，若漫無限制，在公家即係損失，均應一併取締，以資整頓。交通部有鑒於此，即根據各話局局用電話分配　表，分別核定，其應准電話具數，嗣後不得加裝。至職員職員免費電話，一律拆除，惟有接洽公務或指揮調度之必要者，得在住宅內裝設半價電話一具，仍須先經核准方可。</p>
<p>上項均係一年來電話業務整理之成績，茲將各局二十三年六月與二十四年六月電話用戶數，及增設電話局之用戶數列表如左，以示一般。</p>
<h3>請用戶諸君愛護話機</h3>
<p>— 天津電話局廣播</p>
<p>諸位：今天講一段，請電話用戶諸君愛護話機的情形。電話機器，雖然不是用戶自備的東西，一切障碍，都由電話局負責修理的，不過用戶方面，也要盡愛護的責任。這並不是僅為電話局方面着想，實際上與用戶自身也有很大的利益。因為機件發現障碍，由電話局派工修理，至少需要經過相當時間，用戶已經感到許多的不便，假使因為機件損壞，而受賠償的損失，那更不言而喻了。現將應當注意的幾點說說：</p>
<p>聽筒的軟綫不要絞結：軟綫的表面，雖然是紗織的東西，但是裏邊的心，是金屬的細絲所做成的。金屬的東西，沒有棉紗那樣柔　，幾次扭曲以後，很容易拆斷的。金屬細絲折斷了一部分，說話就要生障碍，或者發生雜音，或者竟不能通話。</p>
<p>聽筒不要重擰：說話完畢，必須將聽筒掛上，使掛鈎落下，不然電話就叫不進來。但是在聽筒掛回的時候，不要用力太猛，或故意重擰，因為這樣一來，聽筒螺絲容易寬鬆，有時內部受劇烈的振動，就有電話不通的弊病。</p>
<p>撥號時切勿用力推回：撥號盤撥動以後，須將手指離開，讓撥號盤自已退回原位。在回的時候，有一定的快慢，假使用手指著力推回，快慢就要不準，號碼容易接錯，撥號盤也常常因此損壞。</p>
<p>撥號時候，不要用筆稈等物，就是用自指，也不要深深地　着磁　，以免擦壞。</p>
<p>不要自己折弄話機：話機的構造，雖然不十分複雜，但是各部分位獨距離，都有一定的標準，沒有經騐的人，不可隨便折弄。即使發生了內部的障碍，也應當報告電話局，就會有工人來修理，才不致弄出重大的毛病來！</p>
<p>以上所說，都係極平易之事，用戶諸君，祇要稍加留意，便可辦到，「愛惜公物」，原來是每個公民的美德，何況話機的完善，與用戶諸君的利益，息息相關咧？</p>
<h3>紐約市之會議電話</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>紐約市電話公司之號簿上，載有一種新式電話業務，以備商人與各界人士之用。此項業務，謂之「會議業務」，繁忙主管人員，祇須話機在手，能與各代表晤言於一室，無論其人在海上在船中或在美國之各處也。</p>
<p>電話公司，分此項業務為二類：　主管人員，可發號施令於其僚屬，但僚屬不能回答：　祇須略加話價，公司加上兩路鈎　（　oo　way　Look-up)後，同一電路上各員，均可對答如流。此外並無其他另加費，僅照城區間電話收費。此項業務，多用於散居各處之家屬，尤以例假日為宜，家屬人數，可達接九人之多云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>明年的上海景況</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>本埠報載，某數理哲學家卜一上海之卦，卦為「本卦風雷益之卦風火家人。」照此卦推算，明年上海景況，好比青春男女，性愛彌篤，又得麟兒之狀。因此斷定明年一二月，雖稍不景氣。然自三月至八月，則市況旺盛。尤其小賣商人，將大得意。不過「風火家人」之卦，應戒濫費云。</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌，已鬧了四五年，無論　一四，都受很大的影響。我國自也不能脫逃這狂潮的製擊，尤以全國工商業中心的上　，更形　襟見肘。上海工商業的衰敗，昨今兩年，已呈奄奄之勢。各大小商戶，大減價的旗幟，終年掛着。銀行錢荘，時存倒閉。商店之宣告清理者，亦幾無日無之。凡這種種，都是說明上海景氣的每況愈下。益以白銀的大量輸出，更使昔日繁榮的上海，陷於將近崩潰的絕境。</p>
<p>邇者，聞世界各國，經濟已有轉機之象。一班預言家，政治家和經濟學者，莫不預測世界經濟，不久可以　　。預言家的話，是無根據的，不足取信於人。政治家及經濟學者的推斷，當然可靠得多。依若干政治家所報告，目前各國失業人數，已逐漸減少，各種工　業，亦日　　　　似此，經濟狀況，或果有漸入佳景的希望。</p>
<p>然我國的情形，經濟却仍　凋蔽　　。　　的工商業，雖經政府當局和各實業家，合力謀復興之計，但至今尚未能安定市面。在一般人看來，上海自財政部改革貨幣制度以遠，各業已頓呈活躍，景氣似漸好況。殊不知道稱好轉，不過是受一時的刺激而已。在人民購買力未能真實提髙，商品價格未能真實穩定之前，上海經濟，實尚難使人樂觀。</p>
<p>或者有人說，世界經濟，彼此關係甚為密切。現存各國景氣，即有轉機之兆，上海那有人不隨之而轉變之理。這話很不錯。然我們要明白，我國是一個工商業落後的國家，貿易又處於入超的地位。故恢復經濟繁榮，並不能如別人的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>容易。因是上海景況，亦恐非最近所能挽回。某數理哲學家的預言，也許只能當為一種預言看吧了。要望上海的復興，還有待於各方面的努力。</p>
<p>但據說某數理哲學家，曾以預言滿洲事變，知名於世。目前經華北來滬時，又為我們幾位要人算命，大博名人的讚　。那未他的推測，倒是不能輕視的。大家且看明年的上海景況吧。</p>
<h3>富士山遠景</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>來時是深秋，島國的容顏，恰是碧綠水，秀青山，盈盈清新。在一個涼秋九月的午夜後，從神戶到東京的夜車裏，載著一顆疲倦而又微躍的旅人的心，駛向島上腹地去。忍並了旅途上寒夜的淒寂，車窗外的疏星稀淡；人正困頓得難耐，曉風殘月，待要尋睡。霎忽間如同夢醒，灰白色濛濛罩上，清晨的氣息沁人。張開迷眼，天邊已染上一帶紅霞，綠野清鮮，啟窗而望，一輸艷美的太陽，已在遠處的山頭搖擺而上。但車後面卻突叫出伙伴們的喊聲：</p>
<p>「看喲，富士山在那兒……」就在這時候，島國的富士山，便便露臉了。童年時，會有過富士火山這幾個字的印象，那似乎是以為多麼怪異的，奇髙的，或是滿山燒焦。但當我第一眼瞥見時，是仿佛一頂白帽兒，現在遠處。給近山半遮着，又有誰個說，富士山是終年罩雪，雪不溶解呢？我全忘記旅途的困頓，而在贊嘆着：島國的早晨，那澄爽蔚藍的天邊的遠處，尋過的綠野，青山，日光便落在秀潔清奇，雪自獨聲的富士山峰。朝間庭前葉心上的白露珠在閃滾的神情，也比不上牠的可愛吧。那是怎麼樣的呢？第一遭兒見面的，秀潔絕　的富士！這不是火山，而是雪山啦。</p>
<h3>南通張孝若先生遺墨</h3>
<p>然而，無情的火車，載我前奔；終於，富士山只怱促一見，便落在後面了。到了東京，正未忘那途中的初識。偶爾聽說，登近隣的髙田馬場的草原，便可以看到富士。於是懷着歡欣之情，常登臨四望，卻全無影跡：只能徒作追憶而已。</p>
<p>秋殘風急，踏落葉上草原的時節了！也是在一個朝陽初露時，走出林裏木屋，人竟突然凝住，怎麼面前草原過去，便清晰聳現着富士山那依舊是原來的潔秀雪白的瀟灑彷如出麈的風姿！而更加嶄然在望。一時幾疑是從天而下呢。原來富士美景，雖近在目前；但島上霧多，雲濃，難得像南國那麼老是清朗朗的天色：烟雾　掩，富士山便是被遮没。而　就算是來東京的初見了。</p>
<p>山似不遠不髙，上下左右，盡是白雪，真是雪山：但却遙遙　近，只略見厚雪露縐痕，如美人的田紗衣，婆娑的拖地如成波。近旁山峰髙低，余是青綠一片，截然不同。島國氣候溫和，可是富士山下，住不得人，島國人時聞登山探險，視為奇景；</p>
<p>日前大清早到橫濱接客，這天天色分外清明，車近　濱，突然發現左邊近處，如同屋後，即顯然白峰屹立，富士山又見了。仔細打量，山頭不尖，方圓寬頂，不險不峻，潔白溫雅，秀氣沖淡，十分恬然。惜近而似遠，未易登臨，大有不識真面目之惑。車漸行山漸更現；其旁青山，又逐漸露見。原來青山間也點綴着片片白色，漫雪灑山頭，隱隱渺渺，更引新趣。追望而上，青山迤逶而北，忽又白雪厚積，接現無數白峰，不知尚有許多雪山呢！島國地小，却也有這些奇處所。</p>
<p>要窮追皓白的雪山，層層起落；但車奔甚速，轉灣入低，雪山忽隱忽現，漸去漸茫，只能臨遠嘆婉。</p>
<p>及至午後歸途，定神注望，半空裏抵懸一大白半球似的。原來富士已給電霧遮去大半，僅存山頭隱約猶存，驟見幾至莫辨，如套上面紗，有微羞情態了。富士，終年雪不化，當蔽雲霧裏，可惜只能給人以淡淡遠景。</p>
<h3>憂鬱底歌</h3>
<p>— 白玲</p>
<p>我底心壓着一串憂鬱底歌。我被一個灰白的不可破滅的陰影遮蔽了視綫。我夢想着未來的人生的場面：海里漂着紅不，沙漠長着青草，人底面孔是笑的，街道永是浮蕩着春天的和暖的陽光。</p>
<p>我現在已經沒有笑。我這個世界太小，小得簡直讓我望不到天空，喘不過氣。路，我沒有懈怠的走，但是那麼遼遠呀，一片荒涼的山野。</p>
<p>我聽，聽到四週有人幽幽的叫。只恨路途上充滿了一團暗光，竟使我望不見一個人影。</p>
<p>我的心壓着一串憂鬱底歌。我孤獨的感到了路途上的悽苦。</p>
<p>我茫茫然。我不敢哭，我知道哭是一個傷感人的微弱的表現！我撫摸我底跳躣的心窩，我讓我底心安靜下去。我張望着眼睛，我在追尋我底友伴。突然，我被一陣涼涼的輕換的　風，掀起了煩憂的幻想，我底面前浮著金光，我看見無數的黑的怪影子不住的活動狂奔。</p>
<p>我並不懼怕。我却牢牢的踏着地。我握緊了我的堅硬的手掌。</p>
<p>我終於找到友伴，然而我底友伴像我一樣年輕。但可惜他底心也壓着一串憂鬱底歌。</p>
<p>我問他，他搖搖頭。他用鬰鬰的眼光向我看。他只是揮動着手，沒有說出一句話。他張開了口，而他底喉嚨是啞的。那麼　哀，却靜靜的站在我底面前。</p>
<p>他老看我，現出不安的樣子來，用他的手指　地上劃着：世界上流滿了憂鬱底歌聲。</p>
<p>我點了點頭。我終於泣哭了。於是，我往遠處聽，那憂鬱底歌聲，是洪大了，是廣遍了！當我把眼光開放在這世界上的一個小的角落里，我所看見的都是一片黑色。</p>
<p>漸漸的，憂鬱底歌聲，我是聽熟了</p>
<p>走着，走着，但飢餓又抓紧了我们底喉嚨，於是我們的肚子開始喊叫了。我們坐在荒山之上。我底友伴看了看我，他用牙咬住了嘴唇，握了握我底手，把我按放在樹林里，讓我躺下。並且還猛力的跳起來。我大聲喊着：</p>
<p>—我飢餓！我需要吃！</p>
<p>他底臉上掠起一個苦臉，半天，他</p>
<p>—我也飢餓了……</p>
<p>他終於說話了。我才知道他底喉嚨並沒有啞。</p>
<p>我們又是走。但是夜是深沉了。荒山上沒有家，也沒有燐火。</p>
<p>於是，我底友伴唱起憂鬱底歌：</p>
<p>我們底世界，沒有春天，</p>
<p>辜着夜路，爬着山野！</p>
<p>……</p>

<h3>國防大秘密公映一個極有趣味的故事</h3>
<p>「國防大秘密，3）Steps勞勃杜奈　　　山恩仇記」後唯一大貢獻，並由美麗明星瑪黛琳卡洛合演，該片已公映於大光明，爰將其故事簡述於下，</p>
<p>銀幕啟處，但見某音樂廳中之報吿員，正在台上向聽衆介紹精神學家台泰斯之神技，謂關於過去一切問題，無分鉅細，聽衆如有所詢，均可常塲答覆：不料是時台下突然發生毆鬥情事，槍聲一響，聽衆相率奪門而出。時有一神秘之女郎，藉靑年漢納之助，得安然離去險境。旋復從女郞之請，携之返寓，晤談之餘，得悉時有右手斷去一指之喬頓敎授，企圖揭發英國室軍之重要秘密，而伊則爲一女間諜，職在偵察敎授行踪。不幸女郞竟於翌晨被刦於漢納寓中，於是漢遂决計繼續担任女郞之工作。</p>
<p>漢自女郞所遺之一幅地圖中，得悉敎授之總機關在蘇格蘭，急即乘車前往。途中漢忽發現因爲女郞被刺之嫌疑，探警已追踪而至，漢在車上來往逃避，後因形勢險惡，不得已逃往一車廂中，假冒爲一陌生女郞之情人，曳之强吻。但此僅能朦蔽於頃刻間，而結果終因探警追捕之急，在第四號鐵橋上，離車逃逸。</p>
<p>漢納飛山越嶺，經過種種危險，卒抵敎授之宅，敎授旣得悉漢之來意，舉槍射之，幸彈丸適射在漢納衣袋中之聖經上，未曾受傷，漢遂以此爲證物，訴之警廳，惟敎授在社會上地位甚高，孰能置信，於是漢反被捕，未幾，漢又設計逃出，避至一政治會議塲中，竟被誤認爲一候選者，但是時忽來一女郞，女名梅拉，即前在火車中被其强吻者，信伊爲殺人犯，急趨出報告，因此漢父被補，旋偵探以巴爲證人，强伊同往官署，車抵荒野中，因被羊羣所阻，不能前進，偵探下車視察時，深恐巴之逃逸，方將漢巴二人，鎖在一手拷上。</p>
<p>漢見有機可乘，遂强曳巴逃至一小旅館中，冒稱蜜月情侶，巴俟漢入睡後，乃設法脫去手拷，企圖逃去，但步至樓梯上時，忽聽敎授之同黨，適在旅館內的電話談話，始悉漢納所云，確非子虛，乃復回至室中。翌晨，即將此事告漢，並語以敎授等，將在倫敦派拉典劇塲，發生某項事情，漢等追踪而往，不但一切水落石出，且更有出人意外之驚人結局，那祇有請各位到銀幕上去欣賞了。</p>

The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to lead them to several places, including the Guantai Anzhan. A portion of the troops moved in, while the majority remained in the waiting room. On the morning of the 15th, Battalion Commander Li Guiying notified Liu's Battalion of the 724th Regiment of the 142nd Division of the 32nd Army stationed there, ordering them to vacate the barracks. Although the battalion had been ordered to move south, due to local defense, it had not moved yet, waiting for the 29th Army to take over. Battalion Commander Liu sent a company commander to negotiate with Li, but he was detained as a hostage, forcing the battalion to immediately withdraw and vacate the barracks. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: At about 11 AM on the 15th, due to the detention of the company commander, the troops of Liu's battalion of the 32nd Army in Tanggu were outraged. Two companies of soldiers fully armed rushed out of the barracks, surrounded the station and the Taian Inn, demanding that the security team release the company commander. A conflict ensued, and gunfire erupted, causing chaos in the city. Shops closed their doors one after another. The security team resisted from the station. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, Major Kagawa, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tanggu, and Wu Longfu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, stepped forward to mediate. The security team released the company commander, and Liu's battalion telegraphed their superiors for instructions on the withdrawal date. The security team will occupy the barracks after Liu's battalion withdraws. However, both sides were still on alert on the afternoon of the 16th. As a result of the Tanggu conflict on the 15th, two security team soldiers were killed and one was injured. The number of casualties on Liu's battalion is unknown. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>British and French Suggest Peace Plan for Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Since Mussolini brazenly invaded Abyssinia, the British Empire, fearing that its own interests would be endangered, led the League of Nations to determine that Italy was an aggressor and then implemented military, financial, and economic sanctions. The relationship between Britain and Italy became tense for a time. However, Mussolini did not move his troops north after the capture of Magal, due in part to the heroic resistance of the Abyssinian army and the unfavorable terrain south of Magal, but also because he was unwilling to encroach on the British sphere of influence and directly conflict with the British Empire. Laval took advantage of this opportunity to mediate, and the British and Italian compromise was thus facilitated.</p>
<p>The concrete result of the British-Italian compromise is the peace plan that was announced yesterday. This plan, with the exception of the reservation of the inherent interests of Britain and France in Abyssinia, is entirely tailored to Mussolini's wishes. According to the plan, the eastern Tigray province and the Ogaden and Danakil regions will be completely ceded to Italy, with only a corner of Abyssinia's access to the sea being exchanged. One-third of the rich plateau will also be used for Italian colonial development. The only areas left are the railway areas related to French interests and the Blue Nile water source areas related to British interests.</p>
<p>Although the stubborn Abyssinian emperor has not yet indicated acceptance of this peace proposal, he may ultimately have to yield under the pressure of the three powers. This is not only lamentable for Abyssinia, but also deeply regrettable for the small and weak nations of the world.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Because this peace settlement has an extremely serious significance in encouraging the adventurous spirit of the fascists. Mussolini undermined the spirit of the League of Nations and invaded uncivilized Abyssinia, and was about to receive his due lesson. But Hall and Laval, who are preaching justice and humanity, suddenly changed their attitude and willingly used Abyssinian territory as bait to win Mussolini's favor. Is this not an enlightenment for those in the international community who have aggressive ambitions? The Italian-Abyssinian war may be temporarily concluded in a peaceful manner, but the future international wars triggered by this may become even more tragic.</p>
<p>However, the sympathy of the world's small and weak nations and the people of the major powers for Abyssinia can also gain an important lesson from this peace plan, that is, the imperialists can only support the invaded nations to the extent that they protect their own interests, and in principle they sympathize with aggressive behavior. When the League of Nations officially announced that Italy was an aggressor and passed sanctions, the small and weak nations deeply hoped that Britain and France could uphold some justice, but now the truth has been exposed. The League of Nations is ultimately nothing more than a tool of the British and French imperialists.</p>

He refused to comment on the issue of the Mongolian security team assisting in the defense of Zhangbei and other six counties because the truth is unclear. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Reliable Chinese sources deny reports of renewed fighting in Guyuan yesterday, saying that on Friday, Chinese and "Manchu" soldiers fired sporadically, but there was no shooting on the Guyuan "front line" yesterday.

<h3>Eastern Hebei Prepares Custodial Vault for Issuance</h3>

The custodial vault for the issuance reserve in Eastern Hebei is being planned by a certain country, and it is planned to issue banknotes and stamps for the Eastern Hebei Bank within the coming year to replace various currencies. Due to the establishment of the General Tax Administration by the puppets to collect unified taxes, the Tangshan cement, spinning, and flour mills must still pay unified taxes within the Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi regions for goods transported out of the region, but there is no good way to negotiate, so they have reduced production.

<h3>Confrontation Between Britain, America, and Japan: Pessimism About the Future of the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Japan insists on a common upper limit requirement</p>
<p>Future adoption of private talks to break the deadlock</p>
<p>London: The naval conference is now scheduled to resume on Monday. Most delegations are taking advantage of the weekend holiday to leave London. Japanese representative Admiral Nagano has gone to the suburbs to play golf, while American representative Norman Davis is visiting friends in the countryside. The naval conference has been open for a week, and its future is relatively pessimistic. Two things have been confirmed: Regarding the right to equal naval tonnage, Japan has requested satisfaction in spirit and seeks practical concessions, and will exercise this right when necessary. Britain and the United States originally wanted to make political concessions to Japan in exchange for concessions from that country on naval issues. According to sources from the Japanese delegation, even if a political agreement on Far Eastern issues could be reached between Japan and the United States, Japan would not want to change its attitude on naval issues. The original hopes of Britain and the United States have thus vanished. In short, Britain and the United States have expressed opposition in principle to Japan's demand for naval equality. Hopes for reaching an agreement based on a "quantitative limit" (referring to total tonnage) are slim. Even if this agreement can be reached, the naval conference will still face greater difficulties. If Britain, the United States, and Japan were to establish an agreement based on a common upper limit, the existing naval systems of European countries, including the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, would have to be revised. According to what our correspondent has learned, the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, met with German Chancellor Hitler yesterday and discussed the existing Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Naval figures here believe that the German government will certainly take the opportunity to demand revision. As for the "qualitative restrictions" issue, which the French and Italian delegations wish to discuss, it is still uncertain whether a solution can be found. The key still lies in the hands of the Japanese delegation. Whether that country's delegation will agree to discuss this issue has not been formally indicated, but it is generally believed that the Japanese government believes that the "quantitative restrictions" and "qualitative restrictions" issues are closely related and cannot be prioritized. (Fourteenth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to a message obtained by a foreign reporter from an authoritative source in the Japanese delegation, the Japanese delegation has completed its general outline of the principles and proposals of disarmament in the past week's meetings. However, because the countries only engaged in opposition, there is still a suspicion that it is difficult to obtain the true meaning. Britain and the United States are willing to base their opposition on Britain's extreme advocacy of national defense vulnerability. France and Italy are still filled with vague unease. These are not the original intentions of the Japanese representatives. Therefore, during the multi-faceted private talks that will unfold in the second week of meetings, and the plenary meeting of the chairman of the first committee, they hope to obtain a clearer understanding and eliminate the following misunderstandings, and to give the impression that the legitimate reasoning of the Japanese proposals is consistent: Japan does not advocate equal rights because of the establishment of a common and universal unified treaty like the five-nation treaty. For example, if France and Italy want to introduce other necessary principles based on the local conditions in Europe, they will not hesitate to consider them together; Pointing out the vulnerability of national defense, believing that Japan's equal claims are not appropriate, Because the mobility of naval power should not be underestimated, What Japan is directly concerned with is the permanent continuation of the non-threatening and non-aggressive state of the Western Pacific, and therefore Japan will absolutely not recognize proposals that have the risk of hindering it.

<h3>Red Army Preparedness</h3>
<p>Political and Spiritual Education is Extremely Sound</p>
<p>Both Eastern and Western Borders Can Fight Independently</p>
<p>China Allied Press Special Article: Along with the great success of the Soviet Union in economic and political construction, the Soviet Union is also well prepared in terms of military equipment. First of all, what is different from general capitalist countries is the spiritual education of the Soviet Red Army. Because the composition of the Red Army, 45.5% are workers, and the proportion of farmers accounts for 90%, and they are farmers in collective farms, so they show a political class consciousness. They should shoulder the task of strengthening national defense and unifying research and technology. Furthermore, the proportion of party members and youth league members is 49.3%. Among the regiment leaders, party members also account for 72%, and among the division commanders, they account for 90%. Moreover, more than 15% of the regiment leaders and more than 50% of the division and corps commanders are graduates of national military academies. The soundness of spiritual education can be said to be the best in the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of military equipment and operations, "Chemical defense is first emphasized by the National Defense Association and various military and civilian departments. For example, improving the quantity and quality of the air force, in the tank and artillery units, have increased the substantial chemical power, and train various technical soldiers with excellent chemical warfare knowledge.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the air force has already overwhelmed any country in the world. From the Sixth Congress of the Soviet Union to 1931, the number has increased by 33%, and in recent years, the speed index of fighters and bombers has been increased by one and a half to two times. As for the range and carrying capacity of bombers, it has almost tripled. In this way, the possibility of being attacked by enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighters is even less. In addition to paying attention to various cooperative operations with the navy and army, air force training also focuses on its ability to operate independently.</p>
<p>Speaking of new weapons for land warfare, mechanized tanks increased by 2,475% in pocket-sized tanks after the Sixth Congress, light tanks increased by 760%, and medium tanks increased by 792%. This belongs to the quantitative aspect. In terms of quality, the speed of the tanks has also increased three to six times. There are also artillery aspects. For example, the number of machine guns in infantry and cavalry has increased by more than two times, the machine guns in aircraft and tank units have increased by seven times, the tank guns have increased by four and a half times, and the heavy guns have also increased by more than two times. Old-fashioned guns have long been replaced.</p>
<p>There is also the military liaison. The wireless communication of the army has been gradually completed. Since the Sixth Congress, the number of radio stations has increased by 1,750%, and the number of aviation radio stations has increased by 1,900%. If you want to issue orders, you only need to press a few times on the electric button.</p>
<p>The Soviet Navy has also been strengthened several times compared with the Sixth Congress. If the naval power at the time of the Sixth Congress is 100, the current submarines have reached 535, the coastal defense ships have reached 11,100, and the torpedoes have reached 470. There has also been great progress in coastal defense.</p>
<p>Molotov said it well, "We have to increase the number of the Red Army." So now the Soviet Union's standing army has increased from 600,000 to 1 million. Other party members and workers who can be mobilized at any time are not included. The military budget in 1934 was 1.665 million rubles, and the expenditure of the National Defense People's Committee was 500 million rubles. But this year—1935, the budget of the National Defense People's Committee has increased to 6.5 billion rubles. But the percentage it occupies in the total national budget is smaller than that of any capitalist country.</p>
<p>Molotov also reported at the 17th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, "We have built strong fortresses not only on the western border from Chertkovo to the Black Sea, but also in the most threatened areas of the Far East and eastern Siberia." In 1934, the defense work on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Far East coast had been fully completed. However, the distance from Moscow to Vladivostok is extremely inconvenient for transporting troops and firepower, so on the one hand, the Soviet Union is actively seeking rapid communication, expanding its air force, and in the Far East, it has independently organized independent units of the Far East Air Force, tank artillery, and other units. The Soviet Union has the ability to fight independently in both East Asia and Western Europe.</p>
<p>As for the command talents of the Soviet Red Army, such as Chief of General Staff Yegorov, he can be counted as the only military figure in the world. On his 50th birthday, Stalin sent him a congratulatory message, "I extend my Bolshevik greetings to congratulate you on your 50th birthday. You are an outstanding military commander during the Civil War, one of the organizers of the glorious victory of the Red Army on the southern and western fronts, and the first chief of staff of the Red Army General Staff, causing the enemy to lose heart. I wish you health and energy to work for our Red Army, so that the enemy will lose heart. I remember working with you on the front line before. I am deeply convinced that your military knowledge and organizational talent will definitely benefit our motherland in the future." From whatever aspect you look at it, the preparedness of the Soviet Red Army obviously has a leaping development. Moreover, judging from the situation of its production progress, its military strength is even more likely to be enriched.</p>
<h3>Sacrificing the Weak and Protecting the Strong: British and French Proposals Are Criticized by All Parties</h3>
<p>Fearing Serious Domestic Politics</p>
<p>Italy delays response for three days</p>
<p>London: The East African war has made no progress in recent days. Today, the most important key to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has turned to the domestic political issues of Britain and France. The Laval-Hoare peace plan seems to be difficult to resolve all disputes. Experts say that this plan is only enough to cause political strife in Britain and France. French Prime Minister Laval went to Lyon today to meet with Radical Socialist leader Herriot, because it is said that Herriot said that if this peace plan cannot be cancelled, he will be prepared to resign from his position as a minister without portfolio and overthrow Laval's cabinet. The British White Paper published yesterday stated that Hoare had instructed the British Minister to Ethiopia to "use his best efforts to persuade the Ethiopian Emperor to give careful and well-intentioned consideration to the peace proposals." This has caused a great uproar in public opinion here today, because all parties feel that this proposal is to carve up Ethiopia to benefit Italy. Some observers say that Hoare may resign due to unfavorable public opinion. Prime Minister Baldwin also discussed it in detail when speaking in the House of Commons, and said that the background of this plan has extremely important secret relations. The Daily Mail promptly urged Baldwin today to convene the House of Commons to hold a secret meeting to announce all the facts. The Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, called this plan "disgusting hypocrisy." The Ethiopian Emperor has expressed his anger at the British and French proposals. Mussolini demanded a detailed description of the content of the plan, such as how the area within the Italian sphere of influence in southwestern Ethiopia should be managed and defended. At the same time, small countries in the League of Nations, seeing that the central power of the League of Nations is about to collapse, are still loudly expressing their opposition. Hoare is still in Switzerland and will be questioned by the House of Commons next week. At that time, many members will not support him. Judging from the current situation, the East African War will be suspended next month, but the reason for the suspension will be the approaching rainy season, not the power of diplomacy. The atmosphere in Geneva is quiet. The Committee of Eighteen will meet again after the Executive Council meeting on Wednesday. Mussolini's request for detailed content seems to be a delaying tactic. It is likely that Mussolini will not take any action before the Fascist Party cadre meeting on Wednesday evening. (Fourteenth Day National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Ethiopia's Attitude is Still Unclear: The King Considers Public Opinion as His Basis</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Our correspondent Auchinate reports that the general public believes that the Italian and Ethiopian armies will cease fire on the 15th to calmly study the peace plan proposed by Britain and France, and to propose counter-proposals if necessary. It is difficult to guess what the attitude of the Ethiopian Emperor is towards the peace plan.

<p>London: The White Paper published by the government contains many letters and telegrams between Foreign Secretary Hoare, Italian Ambassador to Britain Sir Drummond, and British Minister to Ethiopia Sir Barton. One of the telegrams addressed to Sir Barton stated, "If the Ethiopian Emperor can use this new opportunity to conduct peace talks, then the talent of a great politician can be manifested." A spokesman for the Ethiopian Embassy in London recently made a statement saying that it is ridiculous to cede half of the country to the invading country, which is what a wise politician should do. Even if the League of Nations General Assembly approves the solution proposed by Britain and France, our Emperor may not act alone without seeking public opinion. Even if our Emperor personally wishes to cede half of the territory to Italy, he will still prefer to follow public opinion. (Fourteenth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Ambitions Unsatisfied: Carving Up Ethiopian Territory Still Deemed Too Small</h3>
<p>Paris: Le Journal reports, "The solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute proposed by Britain and France may not be welcomed by the League of Nations General Assembly, but Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now trying his best to add amendments, making this plan more and more different from the League of Nations Covenant. He declared as soon as he received the plan, during the first meeting with French Ambassador Chambrun, that he would never be willing to give up the holy city of Aksum in Ethiopia. (According to the first paragraph of the peace plan regarding land exchange methods, part of Ethiopia's Tigray province is ceded to Italy, but the city of Aksum remains Ethiopian territory.) In addition, according to the second paragraph of the plan, a zone is demarcated in the Ogaden region of southern Ethiopia as Italy's sphere of influence. Italy can organize a company to improve the economic facilities there. Now, the Italian Prime Minister requires that this company have the right to raise capital and establish police." (Fifteenth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers are still criticizing the British and French peace plan, predicting that Mussolini will definitely reject it. Italians oppose not only the cession of the port of Assab in Eritrea, but also the return of the holy city of Aksum to Ethiopia. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia said that all residents of that city voluntarily surrendered to Italy, so it must not be returned, and said that this proposal cannot even be used as a starting point for peace discussions, because it has not fully taken into account Italy's needs. What Italy wants to know now is whether it is allowed to station troops to protect the economic and colonial areas of Italy in Abyssinia. Italy also wants to know whether Abyssinia will truly disarm, so that Italy can safely withdraw its large army from East Africa. (Fifteenth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Final Judgment Rests with the League of Nations: British Newspapers Defend Government Policy</h3>
<p>London: The Times editorial today stated that the British government's attitude towards the peace plan should dispel the misunderstandings caused by this plan. The League of Nations may not accept this proposal, but it is the League of Nations' right to announce the verdict. No matter what the verdict, Britain will abide by it. The Observer quoted critic Garvin as saying that the British and French peace plan is a way to maintain peace. No qualified politician can replace it. Expanding sanctions to strangle Italy will likely become the fuse of a world war, but sanctions have now come to an end. If the League of Nations morally commits suicide on December 18, then this peace plan must be implemented in accordance with the agreement established by Britain, France, and Italy in 1906. The debate in the British House of Commons on December 19 will clarify the atmosphere, comfort people's hearts, and eliminate the world's worries. (Fifteenth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Bomb Solidifies the Unity of the Hui People: Serious Consequences Will Be Seen in the Near East: Criticism from a Famous Russian Reporter</h3>

Ethiopia's struggle for freedom has aroused the excitement of the local people in Africa and the Arab Muslim people in Syria and Palestine. Britain's current policy will make its position in these places more difficult. The situation is already very tense, and it is impossible to find a way out with diplomatic means alone.

<h3>British House of Commons to Convene Thursday: Debate on Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>The Government to Issue Important Declaration</p>
<p>Plans to Persuade the Opposition with All Efforts</p>
<p>London – Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare recently met with Prime Minister Baldwin to report on the formation of the Italo-Ethiopian peace plan in Paris and the discussions in Geneva. Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden has returned from Geneva and will meet with the Prime Minister tonight or tomorrow morning. These are all preparations for the Cabinet's declaration in the House of Commons on Thursday. The Prime Minister attaches great importance to the upcoming debate on foreign policy and is eager to gather all available information as a key to victory. His goal is not only to defeat the opposition but also to achieve a greater success, as defeating the opposition is already considered a certainty. However, to further persuade them is more difficult, and all efforts must be made. The Prime Minister is accustomed to the opposition's obstructionist stance and does not pay much attention to it. What shocks him most is the significant opposition within the Conservative Party itself. If the opposition party is unwilling to propose an impeachment and settles for criticizing the government, many Conservative MPs may believe that the Cabinet's fate is not in danger and therefore echo the opposition, expressing opposing views. This would impact the great authority the government currently enjoys, which is what the Prime Minister fears. Regarding this matter, various Cabinet members will contact important figures within the Conservative Party in a private capacity in the coming days, urging them not to weaken the government's position by criticizing it, and stating that such criticism, even if not expressed through votes, is still inappropriate. According to parliamentary sources, the government will declare the following points when the House of Commons convenes on Thursday: The United Kingdom will continue to actively support the League of Nations; Since the League of Nations has entrusted the responsibility of seeking peace in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict to the United Kingdom, it should do its best; The solution proposed by the United Kingdom and France is to fulfill this task; The United Kingdom continues to base its position on security and collective action; If other member states of the League of Nations are unwilling to assume responsibility, the United Kingdom does not wish to be solely responsible; Regarding various European issues, the United Kingdom must cooperate with France; In addition, the negative results of the British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps' conversation with German leader Adolf Hitler yesterday may also be mentioned.

<p>Berlin – British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps met with German leader Adolf Hitler and Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath today. The public is paying close attention to this meeting. Official sources announced that they discussed the possibility of arms limitation and the Anglo-French Locarno proposal. The discussion was very harmonious. (Reuters, 14th) The visit of British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps to German leader Hitler yesterday has been interpreted by insiders as follows: While Geneva is mediating the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and the naval conference is being held in London, the British government is proactively re-engaging with the German government on these issues, possibly including the Far East situation, to establish mutual communication. Semi-official sources later announced that the two sides had an open and honest discussion on the issues of arms limitation and the Locarno Pact. Regarding this, it is generally believed that Germany is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. Leader Hitler is very surprised by the developments in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, believing that it may affect the European situation, and that the time to resolve this issue has not yet arrived.

<h3>Founding Father of Czechoslovakia: Masaryk Old, Tired, and Retiring</h3>
<p>President for 17 Years Since Founding, Elected Four Times</p>
<p>His Meritorious Achievements in Liberating the Nation Will Live on Forever; People Remember Him Fondly</p>
<p>Prague – Former President Tomáš Masaryk, old and tired, officially retired this afternoon at Lány Castle. The Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace read the President's resignation letter, which explained that he was stepping down due to old age and inability to handle the heavy responsibilities. It also stated, "Since being elected President in 1918, I have been re-elected four times, accumulating 17 years of experience. I have come to know that the key to maintaining the country lies in adhering to the ideals we embraced when founding the nation, remaining consistent. This is what I can ask of you all, hoping that you will never forget it. I would also like to inform you that I intend to recommend Foreign Minister Beneš as my successor." The former President then returned to his original status as a common citizen. Prime Minister Hodža delivered a speech on behalf of the nation, expressing gratitude, saying that the former President had devoted himself wholeheartedly to national affairs and was now revered by the nation, without any shame. He concluded, "You are the founding father of our nation's liberation. We pledge to carry on your will, to protect the country well, and to make it even stronger."</p>
<p>Furthermore, before the former President Masaryk held his retirement ceremony today, he first signed a pardon, granting amnesty to all political prisoners except those related to foreign countries. At the same time, he also issued a proclamation to the army, stating that the Czech army should continue to serve democracy. Afterwards, Prime Minister Hodža delivered a radio address to the nation, announcing that the President had resigned and elaborating on the President's deeds to express admiration. It is expected that Prime Minister Hodža will convene the National Assembly on the 18th of this month to elect a successor to the presidency. It is also reported that the Cabinet will submit a bill to Congress stipulating that the former President should retain the salary and public funds he received while in office, and that Lány Castle should be designated as the former President's residence to honor his contributions. (Havas, 14th) Retiring Czech President</p>
<p>Former President Masaryk is 85 years old this year. Before the founding of Czechoslovakia, he was from Moravia Province in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. He came from a poor family; his father was Slovak, and his mother was Czech. He studied in Vienna in his early years and later married an American woman. In 1882, he became a professor of philosophy at Prague University, serving for several years. Later, although he once entered politics, he soon devoted himself to scholarship again. At that time, the Habsburg dynasty of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire was in political decline, and it was gradually unable to control the various ethnic groups within its territory. Masaryk had also immersed himself in nationalistic ideas, fiercely attacking the government of the time, and had become a leading figure in the Czech national liberation movement. When the European War broke out in 1914, he believed that the time had come, so he immediately traveled abroad to organize a revolutionary restoration movement, hoping to break away from the shackles of the Habsburg dynasty. He traveled to Switzerland, France, England, Russia, the United States, and other countries, appealing for the Czech national movement wherever he went. Finally, he achieved his goal when the armistice was signed in 1918. In December of that year, the Czechoslovak Republic was declared, and he returned to the country and was elected as the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic. In the past 17 years, he has been re-elected four times. According to the country's constitution, the president can be re-elected for a maximum of two terms. However, he founded the country and made great contributions. Although it is contrary to the provisions of the constitution, it is enough to show the unanimous will of the people.</p>
<h3>Demonstrations Continue After Egypt Restores Constitution</h3>
<p>Cairo – Although the 1930 Constitution has been restored, demonstrations continue. Today, many students gathered in front of the British High Commissioner's office in Egypt, shouting "Independence!" for a long time before leaving. The student committee is now demanding the resignation of the Ministers of Justice and Education and has issued a statement saying that unless the British High Commissioner provides a satisfactory response to the demands of one party regarding the terms agreed upon in London in 1930, which were subsequently rejected, the demonstrations will continue as usual. The Wafd Party recently wrote to the British High Commissioner, accepting the terms of 1930, which stipulate that Egypt should be independent, allowed to join the League of Nations, and that Britain should be responsible for the defense of Egypt, etc. (Reuters, 15th) Cairo – Wafd Party leader Nahas Pasha visited Prime Minister Nassim Pasha today, congratulating him on the restoration of the 1923 Constitution and embracing and kissing him to show his affection. This was the first meeting between Nahas Pasha and the Prime Minister since the student riots broke out on November 13. It is reported that Nahas Pasha requested that general elections be held as soon as possible. The Cabinet is expected to announce an election law based on universal and direct suffrage in the near future. There were demonstrations here today, with many female students participating. There were two incidents of attacks on British people today. One person was attacked by a mob but was rescued by students. It was announced today that the Egyptian University is scheduled to reopen at the end of December.

<h3>Spain: New Cabinet Formed: Former Interior Minister Valladares Appointed Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Strong Opposition from All Factions</p>
<p>The Government's Life May Not Be Long</p>
<p>Madrid – The new cabinet formed by former Liberal Party leader Valladares on Saturday and Sunday may not last long, as the most powerful Catholic party in Congress is strongly opposed. Catholic Fascist Party leader Robles has ordered all municipal officials affiliated with the Catholic Party to resign. (Reuters, 15th) Madrid – Former Interior Minister Valladares, who was ordered to form a cabinet, has now succeeded. The list of appointees is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Valladares, Foreign Affairs Trevillas (Agrarian Party), Finance Capapopleta (Non-partisan), former Prime Minister, Army General Molero, Navy Vice Admiral Salas, Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry Blanco (Radical Party), Public Works and Transportation Del Rio (Progressive Party), Justice and Labor Martinez (Liberal Democratic Party), Education Pecesera (Radical Party). Because the new cabinet is alienated from the most important right-wing Popular Action Party, it can only gain the support of 139 seats out of 442 in the House of Representatives. Some members of the Radical Party will also vote against it. However, the new Prime Minister Valladares said that if the new cabinet cannot obtain the support of a majority of the members, President Zamora will order the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The new Army Minister General Molero was originally the commander of the garrison in Valladolid. He was previously sentenced by the former Army Minister Robles to confinement in a fortress for dereliction of duty and is still in confinement. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The new Prime Minister Valladares recently issued a written statement to reporters, saying, "If the House of Representatives is inefficient in exercising its powers, it is necessary to dissolve and re-elect. If this happens, the government must do so with prudence and fairness, so that all citizens can enjoy all rights, all political disputes can be ended peacefully, and the results of the re-election can create a legitimate and solid foundation for the republican system." He also said that the government should maintain public security in various ways and severely punish all acts of pressure on government agencies and all acts of rebellion. Although the new Prime Minister has these aspirations, the air of opposition to the new cabinet is already very strong in the lobby of the House of Representatives, from the right-wing Royalist Popular Action Party, the Agrarian Party, the centrist Radical Party, to the left-wing Republican Party and the conservative. Former Army Minister Robles is also planning to issue a statement tonight, and the wording is said to be very strong. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Section Chief, Sakamoto, Tours Guangdong and Guangxi. Japanese Consuls Discuss Developing Business in Southern China. Sakamoto Also Aims to Promote Taiwanese Goods.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. The conference of Japanese consuls in Southern China, held in Hong Kong, concluded on the 2nd. The conference reached a special resolution on plans for Japanese business development in Southern China, which was submitted by Sakamoto Ryuki, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of Taiwan and chairman of the conference, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval and implementation. According to Sakamoto Ryuki, "Japan intends to pursue economic development in Southern China. While that is true, this ambition doesn't reflect the intent of the Japanese government. It is merely the action of Japanese expatriates residing in Taiwan. In recent years, Taiwan has become increasingly prosperous, and regarding just agriculture, it has been actively improved. In the past, farmers planted a single crop annually, but now it's changed to two crops per year. Between seven and eight hundred thousand people work in agriculture, and agricultural and by-products have exceeded the levels of previous years. Therefore, we are eagerly seeking to expand sales routes in Southern China and intend to create a large-scale foreign trade organization. The recent conference of Japanese consuls in Southern China reached specific plans for this, and after being approved by the Japanese government, they will be implemented." After the conference, Sakamoto Ryuki left Hong Kong and took a trip to Macau before returning to Hong Kong. On the 3rd, he arrived in Guangzhou by train. He was first greeted by the Japanese Consul in Guangdong, Kawaai Tatsuo, and Vice-Consul Hattori Tsuneo. On the morning of the 4th, Sakamoto, accompanied by the two consuls, paid a visit to the military and political leaders of the province and toured famous scenic spots near Guangzhou. At 9:00 AM on the 5th, he took the Southwest Aviation Company's Antarctic plane to Nanning to visit Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and others. He is scheduled to stay in Guangxi for one or two days before returning to Guangdong, then to Hong Kong, and back to Taiwan. As for the Japanese Consul in Fuzhou, Nakamura Toyoichi, and the Japanese Consul in Shantou, Harada Nakaichi, they have already returned to their respective posts from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Harada Maru Smuggles Silver Out, Resists Inspection, Assaults Customs Officers, Six Arrested</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. The Japanese trading company Harada Shokai's ship Harada Maru, which sails between Qingdao and Tokyo, recently arrived in the city from Tokyo. After loading goods and coal, it planned to leave port at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 11th). The Jiaohai Customs suddenly received a tip-off stating that the Harada Maru was smuggling silver dollars. The Customs then sent three patrols - a Russian named Lan Qin, and Chinese customs officers Yu Wenxian and Kong Guangyi - along with Yokotani, the chief of the Japanese police station, and more than ten Japanese consulate police officers, to inspect the ship. When they checked the bottom of the hold, they found more than 20,000 silver dollars hidden in the coal pile. After Lan Qin and others discovered the silver dollars, they intended to take the suspects and the silver dollars to the Customs for questioning. However, the ship's cooks and sailors not only refused to obey, but gathered a crowd, turned off the lights on the ship, and attacked the customs officers with iron tools and wooden sticks. Lan Qin, Kong Guangyi, Yu Wenxian, and others were severely beaten in the abdomen and head. Fortunately, Japanese police arrived in time to rescue Lan Qin and others from danger. The Jiaohai Customs sent personnel to take the injured officers to Qingdao Hospital for treatment. It is said that Lan Qin suffered a severe head injury and his life may be in danger. Kong and Yu both had cuts on the back of their necks and faces, and the sight was extremely gruesome. After the incident, Yokotani, the chief of the Japanese police station, led Japanese police to arrest six of the cooks who committed the assault: Nakagawa Hiroshi, Takahashi Kikuo, Funato Masakichi, Kino Saburo, Yamahira Yataro, and Izumi Kazunori. Together with the 20,000 silver dollars, they were taken back to the Japanese consulate in five cars for questioning. The Harada Maru was originally scheduled to leave port at 10:00 AM on the 11th, but because of this incident, it was detained by the Customs and did not leave until 5:00 PM. It is reported that the Jiaohai Customs will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese consulate. (11th)</p>
<h3>Zhangzhou's Rice Surtax Still Unresolved, Provincial Government Replies That Collection Must Continue, Xiamen and Quanzhou Fear Food Shortages</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence. Since December 1st, the Fujian Provincial Government has levied a rice surtax in Zhangzhou. Rice merchants in Zhangzhou have risen up in opposition, leading to a suspension of transportation, which has greatly affected the food supply in Xiamen. The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of all trade associations in the city on the 5th to discuss relief measures. It was immediately decided to send a telegram to the central and provincial governments requesting that the order for the rice surtax be rescinded. On the 10th, the provincial government replied by telegram, stating: "Your telegram is noted. This time, the abolishment of various county militia fees and miscellaneous surcharges amounts to more than 2 million yuan annually. In Zhangzhou alone, the abolition amounts to more than 300,000 yuan. The collection of the rice surtax is estimated to only amount to slightly more than 100,000 yuan annually. The abolishment is much greater than the collection, and the burden on the people of the area has been reduced. Currently, the finances are tight, and the militia expenses are all issued by the provincial treasury. It is a necessary measure to raise funds for compensation. We hope you understand this and support us." The provincial government's intention is that the rice surtax must be collected. However, the opposition of rice merchants in Zhangzhou is extremely firm. Since the 1st, transportation has been completely suspended. On the 10th, Huang Duxiang, the accounting supervisor of the Zhangzhou Customs Bureau, consulted with rice merchants in Zhangzhou, requesting that transportation be resumed immediately, and promised that export taxes would be temporarily suspended. The quantity transported will be recorded for a month. During this period, rice merchants will continue to petition the government. If they are granted an exemption, the registered quantities will be cancelled. Or, when the rice is transported for export, 50% of the tax amount will be temporarily levied, and if the government still does not allow the tax exemption at the end of the period, then the registered amount will be paid in full, or the tax amount will be made up in full. This can avoid the suspension of transportation and prevent affecting the food supply in various places. Rice merchants in Zhangzhou agreed that a decision could only be made after obtaining the consent of all relevant merchants. On the 10th, Huang Luheng, chairman of the Shima Rice Trade Association, and Gan Xiaoqing, chairman of the Haicheng Rice Trade Association, came to Xiamen to seek the opinions of rice merchants in Xiamen, which is still under discussion. Since the suspension of Zhangzhou rice transportation to Xiamen, it has already been ten days. However, miscellaneous imported white rice continues to arrive, and rice from areas such as Tongan is being transported to Xiamen at a rate of 300 bags per day. Rice from Zhangtai is also being transported to Xiamen through Tongan, and although the amount has been less in recent days, it is still more than 100 bags per day. It is estimated that within these ten days, more than 3,000 bags of rice have been transported to Xiamen from Tongan and Zhangtai. At the same time, on the 9th, Shanghai merchants also transported more than 900 bags on the Japanese ship Huashan Maru. On the same day, a provincial ship arrived in Xiamen, transporting more than 300 bags. Therefore, although Zhangzhou rice transportation has been suspended, Xiamen has been able to avoid a food shortage in the past ten days. In the past two days, the price of rice has fallen from 8.5 yuan to 8.2 yuan per 100 catties. The food supply in Quanzhou also depends on Zhangzhou rice. After the suspension of Zhangzhou rice transportation, Quanzhou rice merchants immediately purchased 1,188 bags of rice from Putian, which were detained by the Second District Administrative Office at Sanjiangkou on the 7th. After Li Yannian, the pacification commander of the Third District of Quanzhou, telegraphed Putian to prove that it was not smuggling and requested its release, it was finally approved. The opposition to the rice surtax in Zhangzhou and Xiamen is still very active. On the 10th, eleven groups including the Haicheng County Party Department, Chamber of Commerce, and Education Association, telegraphed to request the rescission of the rice surtax order.

<h3>Relief Efforts in Fujian Province, Agricultural Loans Now Underway</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. During the summer and autumn of this year, the coastal counties of southern Fujian, including Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Yongchun, Tongan, Haicheng, Zhangtai, Anxi, and Longxi, were hit by typhoons and torrential rains, causing severe damage to fields, houses, trees, roads, bridges, and dams. In addition to the establishment of the Southern Fujian Disaster Relief Association by the affected counties to solicit donations from overseas Chinese in various islands in Southeast Asia for disaster relief, the Provincial Government Relief Committee also solicited donations of money and clothing from various parties within and outside the province. The disaster relief measures were divided into three types: the first was emergency relief, which involved selecting the most severely affected areas and the poorest people and providing them with cash to purchase food and clothing on their own; the second was work relief, which involved recruiting disaster victims to repair damaged roads, bridges, and dams in the affected counties and paying them wages on a daily basis as a substitute for disaster relief; and the third was agricultural loans, which involved establishing cooperatives in various villages and lending funds to farmers to purchase agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers for cultivation, with repayment after the harvest next year. The emergency relief has been completed for a long time, the work relief is also about to be completed, and agricultural loans are now underway. Here is a summary of the amounts of money and clothing received and paid out by the Provincial Relief Committee for emergency and work relief since April: In terms of income, (A) clothing: the Provincial Capital Boy Scouts raised more than 76,000 items, the Mawei Naval Headquarters sent more than 3,000 items, the Minhou County Party Department raised more than 300 items, the Provincial Women's Association raised more than 300 items, the Youth Association raised more than 100 items, and the total number of miscellaneous items sent was approximately more than 100,000; (B) money: 40,000 yuan from the Central Relief Committee, 100,000 yuan from the Provincial Government, 20,000 yuan from the Nanchang Headquarters, 13,000 yuan from the Fuzhou West Lake Amusement Fair, and the total number of miscellaneous items sent was approximately 200,000 yuan. In terms of expenditure, (A) within the province: more than 20,000 yuan in bandit disaster relief funds for counties including Chong'an, Shaowu, Jianning, Changting, Mingxi, Ninghua, Qingliu, Longyan, and Pingnan; more than 60,000 yuan in typhoon disaster relief funds and more than 30,000 items of clothing for counties including Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Changtai, Haicheng, Anxi, Longxi, and Tongan; 25,000 yuan in disaster relief funds for fishermen in Changle County; (B) 43,000 items of clothing were sent to the Yellow River Flood Relief Association, and 13,000 yuan in cash was sent to the Central Relief Committee. A total of 150,000 yuan in cash and 90,000 items of clothing were distributed. The agricultural loans are handled by the Provincial Government's Special Rural Cooperative Committee, which sends personnel to guide the organization of farmer cooperatives in various counties. The loan funds are provided by the Farmers Bank of China. In the past year, a total of 1.5 million yuan has been loaned out. Currently, the Provincial Government intends to establish a rural cooperative treasury to promote the agricultural goods industry. The capital is set at 2 million yuan, with the Provincial Government contributing half, to be paid in full in five years, and the combined association of cooperatives in each county contributing half, to be paid in full in ten years. Detailed measures are currently being planned. (December 11th)</p>
<p>Songjiang. All Sectors Hold Health Promotion</p>
<p>The County Government, in compliance with the provincial-designated general cleaning case, convened all agencies, groups, and schools at the public sports field at 9:00 AM on the 15th to hold a health promotion ceremony. County Magistrate Li spoke about the significance of health promotion. Representatives from various agencies then delivered speeches. After the ceremony, members of various groups carried dustpans and brooms, lined up, and set off to sweep the streets according to their assigned sections. In addition to the full participation of all agency personnel, more than a hundred firefighters also joined the event this year, making the work enthusiastic and even more so than in previous years. Therefore, the public stood and watched along the roads, showing considerable interest in the fact that the township heads were urging households to clean up the garbage in front of their doors on a regular basis. The sweeping ended at noon, and everyone dispersed to go home.</p>
<p>Jiading. Supervisory Committee Member Visits Jiading for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhu Chunli, an investigation committee member from the Jiangsu Supervisory District of the Control Yuan, arrived in Jiading on the 12th and stayed at the Nanyang Hotel. It is said that his mission is to investigate the county's control cases. In recent days, he has gone to the County Government, County Party Department, Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and other places to investigate the general situation of facilities. Coincidentally, due to the illegal detention of Pan Sigui, the principal of a vocational school, by the Public Security Bureau, the teachers of various public literacy classes in the city went on strike. Committee Member Zhu has specifically gone to all relevant parties to investigate the actual situation in detail and will report it specially to the Supervisory Office for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Suzhou. Theater Conflict Resolved Peacefully</p>
<p>Dong Ziqin, the rescue director of the Fifth Section of the Western District of the Suzhou Fire Brigade, and Wang Guoliang, a supervisor in the Eastern District, went to the Suzhou Grand Theater in Beiju on the afternoon of the 13th to watch a movie. When they bought tickets to enter, a conflict occurred with Zhang Fulin, a ticket collector at the theater. At that time, Dong, Wang, and other staff members were beaten, but because they were outnumbered, they endured it and left. On the 14th, Dong reported the information to the firefighters training in each district at the air defense training center. As a result, the firefighters were very angry and went to the theater to negotiate in three cars with more than 40 firefighters at 2:00 PM that afternoon. A dispute broke out at that time. When nearby police officers heard about it and went to mediate, they were also beaten. In this incident, ticket collector Chen Fulin was seriously injured and vomited blood. There were also minor injuries to three theater staff members, Ye Shuchun, Tang Yuxiang, and Chen Bingwen. Police officer Chen Zhuting was also beaten and injured, and his belt and other items were lost. Soon after, the firefighters dispersed. After the incident, the injured were sent to Tongren Hospital and Xie Zhaoxin's injury clinic for treatment. At 11:00 AM on the 15th, County Magistrate Wu Qiyun took the lead in mediation and invited Fan Junbo, chairman of the Fire Brigade Federation, Cao Guanzhi, the training director, Zhang Shoupeng, the organization director, Tao Shousun, the general manager of the Suzhou Grand Theater, Zhang Hanwei, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and others to the China Goods Department Store to talk. He tried his best to persuade them not to cause a major misunderstanding over minor matters. Fortunately, both sides were willing to settle the matter peacefully, and a peaceful resolution was reached.</p>

<p>Nantong. Litigation Reduction Campaign in Counties Under Nantong's Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Litigation is rampant in the counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong. Xu Zhen, the administrative inspector of the Nantong District, has ordered the counties to investigate and arrest litigation mongers. Sheng Shizhen, the president of the local court, has also suggested that the county magistrates of the six counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing immediately establish district, township, and town mediation committees to reduce disputes among the people.</p>
<p>Yangzhou. Order From Higher Authority to Clear Up County-Owned Public Property</p>
<p>The County Government recently received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, stating that measures for clearing up public property have already been announced and implemented by the Provincial Government and should be earnestly implemented to facilitate rectification. However, the public land properties of various counties in the past have never been cleared up, either because the time has passed for too long and investigation is difficult to complete, or because property rights have been encroached upon. The above situations are all unavoidable. In accordance with the provisions of Article [blank], a notice should be issued within a specified period to make it public, and a detailed investigation should be conducted to ensure completeness and avoid omissions.</p>
<p>Hangzhou. Explosion of Hand Grenades Kills Four</p>
<p>Cheng Wei'en, a resident of No. 31 Maozhu Lane, East Street, Hangzhou, and his friend Chuan Changhai, ran a second-hand store together. Recently, they somehow obtained more than a hundred hand grenades and placed them in the empty house at No. 29 opposite. On the evening of the 14th, Cheng and his wife, and Chuan Changhai invited Cheng's younger brother, Wei Mao, who worked in an iron factory, to their home to discuss taking out the gunpowder in order to sell it separately from the iron casings. Due to careless handling, the ammunition exploded with a deafening roar. At that time, a wall about three zhang high suddenly collapsed, crushing many houses in the lane and injuring more than ten people. They were rushed to the Municipal Hospital and Guangji Hospital for treatment. One person, Ruan Yuan's wife, died before arriving at the hospital. Cheng's wife, You Xiang, his son, He Shang, and Chuan Changhai all died from their injuries on the morning of the 15th. The lives of the other several people are also in critical condition. It is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Ningbo. Winter Labor Service to Build River Embankment</p>
<p>The Yinxian National Winter Labor Service has been decided by the Implementation Committee to start on the 22nd with the construction of a river embankment. Because the first section of the project is located in the northern suburb town, the commencement ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Beiguo Temple. The laborers participating in the project will be subsidized by the association with half a liter of rice per person for lunch, which is equivalent to four fen in legal tender. The workers are to provide their own food for breakfast and dinner. The labor service area includes the three townships of Beijiao, Longxu, and Gaoqiao, and part of the two townships of Yinghu in the western suburbs.</p>
<p>Wenzhou. Wenyu Road to Start Construction on the 21st</p>
<p>After receiving the order for national labor service, the Yuhuan County Government has formulated a plan to build Wenyu Road, from Chumen Town in the third district to Aoyu in Wenling. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 21st of this month. All laborers in each township in the third district have been ordered to participate in the service. It is reported that the shop assistants in various businesses in Chumen Town should pay labor service fees. The stores are willing to take responsibility for paying in full to avoid hindering the business operations of the stores.</p>
<p>Bengbu. Bandit Wanted in Fuyang Arrested in Bengbu</p>
<p>Wang Leting, a notorious bandit from Fuyang, was a leader under the notorious bandit Zhang Xuelang, who had been killed. In the autumn of 1925, Wang gathered a crowd to attack Wanghua Village in Fuyang, looting the entire family of wealthy farmer Li Pinsan and seizing five of Li's self-defense rapid-fire rifles. This is on record with the Fuyang County Government. In 1933, Wang fled to Lieshan Coal Mine in Suxian County to work as a miner in order to avoid capture by local militias. Recently, Wang lost his job due to the closure of the Lieshan mine and came to Bengbu to seek other opportunities. Coincidentally, Li Pinsan also came to Bengbu for business. On the 13th, the bandit went out for business and happened to meet Li Pinsan in front of Wenfang Hospital on Erma Road. Li Pinsan immediately grabbed Wang and called the police officer on duty, who took him to the police station of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. They were then taken to the headquarters for questioning to determine how to proceed.</p>
<h3>Science Miscellany: Animals and Life</h3>
<p>— Bing Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, domestic schools have gradually recognized the importance of science education, and they are willing to make every effort to equip themselves and recruit talents in mathematics, physics, and chemistry to teach these subjects. This allows students to learn with great understanding, which is a good phenomenon in education. If we can continue in this direction, mathematics, physics, and chemistry will surely develop rapidly in China, producing highly specialized talents to meet the needs of the country and society. Zoology, originally a part of natural history, has been neglected by educators in our country. Because this field focuses on insects, fish, birds, and animals, it has always been considered impractical and has not received attention. As a result, this subject is either missing from the school curriculum or, if it exists, it does not have an equal status with mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This is because most Chinese people are not familiar with this subject and do not know its significance, which has led to this fundamental error in the education system. In fact, the importance of this subject is no less than that of any other science, as it is not only related to practical applications but also has a great influence on human thought.</p>
<p>The most obvious relationship with animals is in medicine. Humans are animals, and studying the pathology of the human body requires using various animals for experiments. Therefore, those who study human anatomy must first study the comparative anatomy of vertebrates to establish a solid foundation. Those who study human physiology, human pathology, and other medical subjects must also study animal physiology as a foundation. Moreover, in the study of human physiology and pathology, animals are used extensively for experiments. There are many problems that cannot be experimented on humans, so animals must be used as experimental materials. Medicine is like this, and veterinary medicine requires even more animal science. The relationship between medicine, veterinary medicine, and people's livelihood is very far-reaching and is based on animal science.</p>
<p>Agriculture and animals are also closely related, as those who study agriculture can attest. In agriculture, subjects such as animal husbandry, dairy farming, and poultry farming require knowledge and training in animal science as an entry point. Entomology is especially closely related to crops, horticulture, forestry, sericulture, and other subjects. If we look at the various fields of agriculture, there is almost none that does not require entomology. Entomology is a part of animal science, and those who study entomology must have training in animal science. Fisheries or aquaculture cannot be separated from animal science. Among aquatic products, in addition to fish, mollusks and crustaceans have considerable economic value. Their life histories and geographical distribution should be studied by specialists to provide resources for hunting, conservation, and cultivation. Planktonic animals are sufficient to serve as food for various economic aquatic products to help their propagation, which also requires zoologists to conduct investigations.</p>
<p>Industry also needs animals in various ways. The feathers, bones, horns, tendons, skins, and other materials of various animals can be used to make textiles, ornaments, and various utensils. The development of whaling is due to the wide use of whale oil. Sea dog skins can be used to make fur coats. Cod liver can be used to make oil. Insects can produce silk, honey, wax, glue, and pigments. Various other animals can be used as food, and various substances in their bodies can be extracted by chemical methods to become industrial raw materials, too numerous to mention. Animals are needed for human clothing, food, and shelter, almost everywhere we look.</p>
<p>The need for animal science in medicine, agriculture, and industry is very obvious. Beyond practical applications, the most noteworthy aspect of animal science is its close relationship with our view of life. Animals are ubiquitous in the universe. Even the simplest animals exhibit life phenomena that are often similar to human life. Higher animals are even closer to humans. People with a general knowledge of zoology, who are good at learning and reflecting, can understand their own strengths and weaknesses through the lives of animals. They can preserve and encourage the good qualities, and they can avoid and work to eliminate the bad ones. Not only individuals benefit, but the relationship between people can be improved, and the order of society and the happiness of the community can be increased. This is why this subject is related to education, psychology, sociology, politics, history, philosophy, and other fields.</p>
<p>The above is a discussion of the functions of this subject. There are many omissions that cannot be discussed in detail. Below, let's talk about the animals themselves. If we look at the evolution of animals, the earliest ones are single-celled animals. All their functions are managed by a single cell, and there is no so-called nervous system. A little further on, the animal's body is composed of a number of cells, among which there are tissues, and the nervous system and muscle tissue are either mixed or distinguishable, but their structure is still very simple. A little further on, the animal's body has a more solid structure, and various tissues are more complex than before. Various systems are formed from tissues. At this time, nerve ganglia appear in the animal's nervous system. In addition, there are larger trunks and various horizontal connections. Nerve fibers reach all parts of the body. Further up the scale, animals have a sound structure, and various systems become more complete. The nervous system has several ganglia that gather to form the brain, which is solid and without a brain cavity. From this, there is a larger trunk extending to the tail, with several nerve ganglia distributed on this trunk. The number of these ganglia is often similar to the number of body segments of the animal. This structure is transformed into a higher form. All the nerve ganglia on the trunks move forward and concentrate in the head, forming a single brain without a brain cavity. From then on, the evolution of animals becomes higher. All animals have a notochord, and on the back of the notochord, there is a spinal cord. The front end of the spinal cord is the true brain. In the brain, there are brain cavities. In higher chordates, the brain can be divided into five parts. From fish to amphibians, from amphibians to reptiles, from reptiles to birds, and from birds to mammals, their brains all have five parts. The foremost part is called the forebrain, which is the cerebrum. Slightly behind is the diencephalon, slightly behind that is the midbrain, then the hindbrain, also called the cerebellum, and behind that is the medulla oblongata, all of which grow in front of the spinal cord. At this point, the development of the nervous system is complete. Among mammals, the higher its position, the more developed its forebrain. The foremost part of the human brain is particularly developed, extending in all directions, almost covering the other parts. Therefore, the name "cerebrum" comes from this. The superiority and inferiority of various animals are determined by various forms, but it is better to determine them by the nervous system. From the lowest protozoa to the highest mammals, the so-called humans, the degree of development of their nervous systems is quite sufficient to represent the height of their position. In the evolution of animals, all the substances in their bodies have a tendency to move from simple to complex and from fragmented to complete, but there are often phenomena of unevenness and misalignment. That is, in the lower positions, the substances in their bodies sometimes develop more than those of higher animals. Therefore, tracing the course of evolution may be regrettable because of detours and ruggedness. If the nervous system is used as the standard, this difficulty can be avoided. The more developed the nerves, the higher the evolution. Therefore, what zoology deals with is all life phenomena of animals, and the nervous system of animals should be the first problem to pay attention to.</p>

<h3>City News: The Municipal Secondary School Education Association and More Than Eighty Secondary Schools Issue a Declaration on the North China Problem</h3>
<p>Now Attending the Last Lesson, Willing to Stand at the Forefront in the Future</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Union and more than eighty secondary schools issued a declaration on the North China issue. The declaration is recorded below: "During this period of severe national crisis, we cannot but deeply recognize our own responsibilities and bury ourselves in academic work to save the country. However, while working hard, we cannot but hope that the government will make the greatest effort to save the fate of being dissected at this time. We believe that if we cannot stop the North China separatist movement with a background, then in the near future, the devil's hand that interferes in internal affairs will surely drive out China's sovereignty from North China and carry out the colonization of North China at a very high speed, as a basis for conquering the entire China. Therefore, the North China issue is the issue of the entire China. The survival of North China is the survival of China. What we now hope for from the government is to use the most resolute attitude and the most effective means to eliminate the North China separatist movement. We oppose unlimited concessions and oppose the act of carrying firewood to put out a fire. We firmly believe that if the government makes a heroic sacrifice to protect the independence of sovereignty and the integrity of territory, then every one of the 400 million people will be willing to contribute everything they have to support the government. Even if the lives and property of these 400 million people are sacrificed to fight for national survival, they will not regret it. We are now attending the "last lesson," but we are looking forward to the arrival of glorious days and dare to declare that when the government asks the people to resist insults and fight for survival, we can stand at the forefront and not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood." This declaration is issued jointly by the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Union, the Minguang Middle School, the Private Shanghai Middle School, the Shanghai Women's Middle School, the Binhai Middle School, the Peiming Women's Middle School, the Jianguo Middle School, the Daozhong Women's Middle School, the Guangxia Middle School, the Anhui Middle School, the Meihua Women's Middle School, the Xinhua Vocational Middle School, the Shanghai Kindergarten Teachers' College, the Zhengxing Women's Middle School, the Cihang Midwifery College, the Guangshi Middle School, the Youth Middle School, the Chengdong Women's Middle School, and eighty-six other schools on December 15th.</p>

<h3>Various Provincial Flood Relief Associations Plan Winter Relief for Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors and Supervisors Will Meet This Month to Discuss Implementation</p>
<p>According to Dagong News, this summer, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River breached their banks and flooded, causing severe floods in Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and other provinces. With the support of well-known figures in domestic charity, the Shanghai community established the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces to raise funds for disaster relief in various provinces. In the first phase, fifty thousand yuan was borrowed from the banking community in this city in August this year, and directors were appointed to investigate and release funds for emergency relief in the seven disaster-stricken provinces, according to the severity of the disasters in each province. This has now been completed in turn. Recently, the central government issued a 20 million yuan flood relief public bond, which is responsible for distributing and handling the work-for-relief affairs in the disaster areas by the National Economic Commission, and is actively planning and will soon begin. It is now known that the association is gradually entering severe cold weather, and the disaster-stricken provinces have not yet fully recovered. The disaster-stricken people are surviving the disaster without clothes or food to spend the harsh winter. It has been decided to plan winter relief for the flood disasters in various provinces in accordance with the precedent of handling drought winter relief last year, so as to facilitate spring plowing next year. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be convened this month to discuss specific methods and actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Ample Preparations by Silver and Money Exchanges; Hope to Weather the Year-End Settlement Period Steadily</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Money Exchanges' Delay in Repaying Financial Public Bonds; Although Various Industries are Declining, They are All Striving for Self-Preservation</p>
<p>The year-end settlement period for various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China is tentatively set for January 23rd. It will be officially announced after being approved by the Money Exchange Executive Committee Meeting. Both silver and money exchanges are well-prepared. The Ministry of Finance has approved the money exchanges' request for a temporary postponement of financial public bond repayment. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Settlement Period Tentatively Set</p>
<p>The year-end settlement period for various industries has been tentatively set for January 23rd (Thursday). It will be officially announced after being approved by the Money Exchange Association's Executive Committee on the 24th of this month. Various industries rely on the money exchanges as their foundation. Now that the year-end settlement period is approaching rapidly, various industries have made preparations. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as per annual practice, are handling interbank overdrafts and short-term loans as the year-end settlement approaches. While this directly regulates interbank finance, it indirectly helps industries and businesses. Because various banks and firms are replenished, they can be more flexible with outstanding payments from industries and businesses.</p>
<p>Money Exchange Public Bonds Temporarily Postponed for Repayment</p>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of financial public bonds in the 24th year of the Republic of China to aid the money exchanges, and established a Money Exchange Supervisory Committee to oversee it. After receiving assistance, the various firms safely navigated the difficult times. Now that the deadline has long passed, aside from the 3 million yuan from the money exchange reserve fund and the 4 million yuan from various commercial banks which have been repaid in full, approximately 17 million yuan of the 18 million yuan from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications remains unreturned as of yesterday. The money exchanges requested a temporary postponement of repayment, and the Ministry of Finance, along with the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, have approved it. Repayment will be arranged after the year-end settlement of various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Ample Reserves in Silver and Money Exchange Reserves</p>
<p>The banks belonging to the Banking Joint Reserve Committee, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Yanye Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Siming Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, and 29 others, have collectively deposited over 60 million yuan in reserve assets. The money exchanges belonging to the Money Exchange Joint Reserve Fund, including Fuyuan, Fukang, Hengxun, Dade, Yida, Zhentai, Zifeng, Zikang, Juntai, Tongyu, and 44 others, have collectively deposited over 30 million yuan in reserve assets. The total amount of reserves in the above two institutions has reached over 100 million yuan, which is exceptionally abundant. When needed, all member banks and firms can borrow from the reserve fund for adjustment.</p>
<p>Various Industries are Declining but Striving for Self-Preservation</p>
<p>The various industries in Shanghai are affected by the global economic downturn, leading to a lack of capital. The decline is more severe than last year, especially in real estate, shipping, flour, textile, and rubber industries, which are suffering the most. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, there has been a slight resurgence due to increased capital. Currently, various industries are striving for self-preservation. For example, the shipping industry has decided to increase fares by 20% starting from New Year's Day next year to save itself. The textile industry and others are uniformly tightening their belts to maintain the status quo. As for the silk factories, due to improved foreign sales and soaring silk prices, they are able to make a profit, but they are forced to stop work due to the depletion of raw materials. The above industries have made considerable preparations for the difficult year-end settlement in the 24th year of the Republic of China and are expected to weather it with great effort.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Audit Office Implements Inspection System</h3>
<p>All Bidding and Procurement of Items Must Be Inspected; Implementation of This System Can Eliminate Malpractices – Shanghai's Financial Revenue and Expenditure Are Gradually Getting on the Right Track</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, since its establishment, the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department has been working hard on auditing, and the city's finances have gradually returned to normal. According to Director Lin Jinyu, who spoke to a reporter from Da Gong She yesterday, the office will continue to implement the inspection system, and will conduct inspections of all financial revenues and expenditures of national institutions stationed in Shanghai at any time. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai's Finances Have Returned to Normal</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department was suggested by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, with the hope that the city's finances could be systematically put on the right track to comply with the budget and final accounts. Since its establishment, the office has first audited the annual budgets of the municipal government itself and its subordinate bureaus of finance, society, education, public security, land, public utilities, public works, and health, as well as other affiliated institutions. After a detailed review of the financial revenues and expenditures, including increases and decreases, the finances have returned to normal. This year's budget and final accounts are expected to match.</p>
<p>National Institutions Are Implementing the System Gradually</p>
<p>Due to the short time since its establishment, the Shanghai Audit Office is currently only auditing the municipal government and its subordinate bureaus. However, the mission and powers of the Audit Office are equivalent to supervision. The office is currently conducting a gradual implementation of the audit of the expenses and revenues of various institutions affiliated to the National Government stationed in Shanghai, such as the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, telegraphs, shipping, maritime administration, savings and remittances, and aviation. This will ensure that the budgets and final accounts of various institutions have a good effect.</p>
<p>Implementing the Inspection System</p>
<p>The inspection system is slightly different from auditing. On the one hand, it audits the economic situation of various institutions, and on the other hand, it inspects the internal and external business operations and sales of various institutions. For example, the purchase and use of items by state-owned institutions, regardless of the price, and the bidding and procurement of materials and the construction of houses, must be inspected by the Audit Office. However, due to the heavy workload, it is currently engaged in planning and implementation. It is certain that after the implementation of this system, all kinds of malpractices and obfuscations will be reduced.</p>

<h3>Liujiang Coal Mine Company Solemnly Declares Yesterday Regarding Property Rights Case Denies Merger with Taiji Company; Currently Seeking Legal Remedies</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Liujiang Coal Mine Company, owned by Chinese merchants, is having its Heishan Yao mining area in Linyu County illegally occupied by the Japanese Taiji Company. The company has repeatedly reported this to the competent authorities for negotiations with the Japanese side, but with no results. Recently, the board of directors of the Liujiang Company decided to file a lawsuit according to law. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Daily News published a news item about the Liujiang Coal Mine Company and the Japanese Taiji Company, stating that the Liujiang Company had long been merged with the Taiji Company. The company believes that this matter concerns property rights and cannot allow the Japanese newspaper to distort the truth. Yesterday, it issued an important statement, which is as follows: We have seen a news item in the Daily News of the 12th of this month regarding the Liujiang Coal Non-Buy Alliance, which stated that the Liujiang Coal Mine Company had long been merged with the Taiji Company of our country (Japan). Our company has been licensed to mine coal in Linyu County, Hebei Province, for twenty years. The mining areas approved for our company and the Taiji Company, which is a Sino-Japanese joint venture located in the neighboring mine, have clear boundaries and do not interfere with each other. On March 8th of this year, taking advantage of the Sino-Japanese situation in North China, Ishida Hisatomo of the Taiji Company, accompanied by Japanese police, erected boundary markers within our company's area. On May 4th, he sealed off all of our company's mining property and the Qinhuangdao station coal yard in the name of the Taiji Company. Although our company reported this to the Hebei Construction Department, which ordered the county to correct it, and also requested the National Government to negotiate, the Taiji Company ignored it and transported all of our company's coal to Shanghai for sale. Our company is currently seeking legal remedies. The statement in the newspaper that our company has long been merged with the Taiji Company is not true. We hereby solemnly declare this and hope that all sectors will take note.</p>
<h3>Three Million Yuan of Shandong Disaster Relief Public Bonds Collateralized for Half Amount of Loan Eight Banks Including Central Bank's Jinan Branch Agree to Lend; Shanghai Headquarters Telephones Approval and Contract Can be Signed</h3>
<p>According to New News Agency, the Shandong Provincial Government, in order to carry out work relief, has collateralized 3 million yuan of disaster relief public bonds issued by the Economic Commission to the Central Bank of China and other banks in Jinan at 50% for 1.5 million yuan in cash. The banks have telegraphed their Shanghai headquarters for instructions, and after several consultations, the contract can be signed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Collateral Ratio Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to relieve the flood disasters in various provinces, has issued 20 million yuan of disaster relief public bonds. The National Economic Commission investigated the disaster situation in various provinces and issued them separately. The provincial authorities themselves collateralized these for cash from the banking community. The Shandong Provincial Government received 3 million yuan of these public bonds. In order to implement work relief and relieve disaster victims as soon as possible, Wang Xiangrong, the Director of Finance of the province, contacted the banking community in Jinan. As a result of the collateral negotiations, it was decided to temporarily collateralize the bonds for 1.5 million yuan in cash at 50% of the face value. It was also agreed that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Minsheng Bank would jointly assume 1.1 million yuan, and the Donglai Bank, the Continental Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and the Shanghai Bank would each assume 100,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Telegraphing Shanghai Headquarters for Instructions</p>
<p>After contacting the Shandong Provincial Government, the Central Bank and other banks immediately telegraphed their Shanghai headquarters, reporting the negotiation process and the amount to be undertaken. After receiving the telegram from the Jinan branch, the headquarters exchanged views. They agreed that the flood disaster in Shandong Province this year was particularly severe, and that this loan was entirely for work relief and should be assisted. Therefore, they expressed acceptance of the collateral principle. However, the amount of the loan, interest rate, and term of the loan still needed to be discussed in detail before a decision could be made. Various industries have telegraphed their Jinan branches to follow suit. It is expected that after several consultations, the contract can be formally signed. It is also heard that the face value of the disaster relief public bonds has not yet been printed. It was decided to first hand over the reservation coupons to the banks for safekeeping, and then exchange them later.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Received Donations for Flood Relief Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th), this newspaper received donations for flood relief, including 10 yuan from the Guangxinxiang Store of Yokohama Overseas Chinese, 3.5 yuan from students of the Sanyi New Market Private School in Guanyun (solicited by Jiao Yinlu), 5 jiao from Chen Jiayu, 2.3 yuan and 4 jiao from Zhu Jigen and others, 2 yuan from Xi Jiuda, and 1 yuan from Pan, totaling 19.3 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Long-Distance Telephone Completed Trial Calls to Begin Within Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications started to install equipment for the Shanghai-Guangdong direct long-distance telephone line in April of this year. During this period, Xu Xueyu, the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Deng Zongyao, the Director of the Guangdong Telephone Bureau, consulted on all conditions and procedures. The Shanghai station was completed in September, while the Guangdong station was delayed due to the slower progress of the project. The Ministry of Communications then added technicians to assist in Guangdong, and the entire project has now been completed. It is planned to start trial calls within days. If the results are satisfactory, official calls will begin in January of next year. It is also learned that it is planned to upgrade the line to allow direct calls between Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong in the future. Hong Kong's consent is currently being sought. Once the conditions are agreed upon, a long-distance telephone line can be laid between Hong Kong and Guangdong. In the future, calls between Hong Kong and Shanghai will only need to be relayed from Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Aircraft Accident Completed; He En Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last; Report on Investigation to Li Jingcong Today; Third Giant Aircraft to Fly to Shanghai Around 27th</h3>
<p>After the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 5 aircraft crashed in Lingtai County, Gansu Province, on the 27th of last month, the company immediately dispatched He En, the head of the aircraft and navigation group, to Xi'an, then to the scene of the accident to investigate and handle the aftermath of the deceased pilots. After arriving, He En coffined the bodies of the two pilots and decided to transport them to Shanghai via the Longhai Railway. The two injured passengers are being treated in Xi'an and are expected to recover soon. He En has completed all matters and took the Shanxi-Chengdu scheduled flight south from Shaanxi on the 14th, arriving at Longhua Airport at around 6 pm that day. Because yesterday was Sunday and the company was closed, He En will go to the company today to report the circumstances of the accident to General Manager Li Jingcong. The bodies of the two pilots will be transported to Shanghai, and a memorial service will be held at the German church on Da Xi Road. Whether they will be buried in Shanghai or returned to Germany is still up to the families of the two pilots to decide. In addition, the company has found that passenger traffic on the Xi'an-Lanzhou section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang line is extremely developed, and the existing W30 and W34 aircraft have too few passenger seats, so it has telegraphed the German Hansa Company to lease another Rongsheng 52 giant aircraft for use. The company has received a telegram from Hansa Company stating that the second giant aircraft will be flown by the famous pilot Mr. Guruge from Berlin on the 20th. If there are no delays en route, it will arrive in Shanghai around the 27th.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Takes Over the Xili Line Yesterday Other Lines Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took back its inland waterway routes from the Zhejiang Construction Department in May of this year, it has been contracting them out to merchants. Among them, the Xili (Wuxi to Liyang) line was contracted by the Da Zhonghua Hengyu and other three steamship companies, with a lease term of six months. It expired yesterday. The company believes that the revenue of this line is excellent, and has decided to take it back and operate it itself. The termination of the contract has already been agreed upon by both parties. At 9 am yesterday, Chen Weiqing, the Chairman of the Inland Waterway Small Wheel Committee of the company, accompanied by 32 staff members, went to inspect and accept the handover. The contractor immediately completed the handover. Starting tomorrow, the company will send personnel to operate it. It is heard that the company also intends to take back several other lines, but as the contracts have not yet expired, it will postpone calling the other parties for consultation.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Yushang Salt Farmers Petition Again Today</h3>
<p>Salt Fields Not Collecting in Full According to Regulations Representatives Still Need to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>The salt farmers of Yuyao are being oppressed by salt merchants, and the Transport Commissioner has approved a 60% collection rate. The salt farmers have elected representatives, including Shang Cailian, to come to Shanghai to petition the Audit General Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau. With the assistance of gentry from all sides, Director Zhu Tingqi sent personnel to receive them and conveyed that the prescribed amount of kilograms must not be shortchanged. The temporary 60% collection rate will still be supplemented by the remaining 40% of the salt amount, pending orders from the Transport Commissioner's office to comply. The representatives thought that the order had been issued and that they would no longer be oppressed by the salt merchants. Unexpectedly, almost 20 days after the representatives returned to Yuyao, the order had not arrived at the salt fields. It was suspected that the salt merchants had colluded and blocked the order. The public was in a state of anxiety and demanded that the representatives continue to come to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. The representatives, including Shang Cailian, petitioned the Audit General Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau again the day before yesterday (the 14th). An inspector Shen received them and said that the instructions had been issued and that they could return to Yuyao with peace of mind. He also relayed to Director Zhu to immediately order the Transport Commissioner's office to rush to collect salt in full. Details have been reported in the newspapers. The salt farmer representatives, including Shang Cailian, are scheduled to go to the Audit General Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau at 18 The Bund again this morning (the 16th) to petition again in order to obtain the instructions to collect salt in full and ensure that the salt fields collect in full according to the scale. Only then will the representatives leave Shanghai. Otherwise, they will have to go to Beijing to petition President Jiang of the National Government directly.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Instructs that Flower Stamps Should Be Affixed to Monthly Settlement Books</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce replied to Luodian Gongda Liquor Store yesterday, instructing on flower doubts, saying: We received your letter of the 13th of this month, inquiring about the matter of affixing stamp duty, and attached three sample sheets. We have read them carefully. We now reply as follows: Monthly settlement books for verifying profits and losses cannot be said to be unrelated to business, and should be affixed with stamp duty according to law. Account statements sent to shareholders for review are different from account statements issued to customers for collection, and there are no clear provisions for affixing flower stamps. The Ministry of Finance also has instructions to exempt them from stamping. These account statements, whether sent once a month or once a year, do not need to be stamped. However, for the sake of clarity, it seems that the words "To So-and-So Shareholder" should be noted on the back of the account statement. Liquor coupons issued are not double-linked, and checking the sample sheet attached to your letter also shows that it is in the form of an ordinary account book, and it cannot be regarded as a stub. If you do not affix a stamp, it will inevitably lead to disputes over inspection, deduction, and fines.</p>

<h3>Cai Zengji Re-Explains the Significance of Land Reform Policy: Reassessing Land Value, Circulating Real Estate, Rescuing Finance, Standardizing Property Registration, Unifying Measurement to Avoid Litigation</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Cai Zengji, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau and concurrently the Director of the Land Bureau, attended banquets hosted by the Westerners "David" and "Hisen" at the Metropolitan Hotel the day before yesterday.  That day, several hundred well-known Chinese and Western figures attended.  Director Cai gave a detailed speech on land reform measures during the banquet, which is translated below: "Regarding the issue of land reform, much has recently been published in various newspapers. This issue deserves the attention of leaders in the financial and commercial sectors, as well as socially concerned individuals from all walks of life. Recently, the Land Bureau's proposal for land reform has sparked much interest and criticism from the public, for which I am very grateful. As you all know, land occupies an important position in the development of Chinese culture. The prosperity of Shanghai is largely due to land, like the gold mines of Africa and the rubber industry of the South Seas. There are currently no accurate statistics, but it is believed that a majority of Shanghai's merchants and the bourgeoisie invest in land, making it an important asset.</p>
<p>Foreign Investment: A large portion of the capital formerly invested in land in this city was imported from both domestic and foreign sources. The prosperity of Shanghai today owes much to foreign investment. A large portion of the funds China uses to pay for import surpluses in foreign trade remains in Shanghai as land investment. Other funds imported into China from abroad through international trade are also used for land investment. The global economic downturn has not spared China, especially in this most important city in the Far East. There are many reasons for this downturn, which I will not elaborate on here, but the stagnation of the real estate industry is an important cause of today's recession.</p>
<p>Real Estate Value Soars: The financial tightening caused by the economic downturn has also implicated the failure of various commercial banks in Shanghai in recent years due to the stagnation of real estate. Before the recession, various credit facilities were expanded, and everyone considered real estate investment and mortgage lending to be the most profitable businesses. As a result, land prices soared, construction increased, and real estate transactions became lively. In this artificially prosperous market, real estate investment turned into speculation. Today's economic panic is inversely proportional to the prosperity of the past. If we want to return to the prosperity of the past, we must restore the old situation of real estate investment. Circulating Real Estate: To reform today's ills, we must make real estate flow smoothly and re-evaluate land values. In a fair manner, we must revise the excessively high real estate values ​​of the prosperous era to a real value and organize a financial company. The mission of this company is to enable all real estate mortgages currently held by banks to be rediscounted at any time, because banks cannot lend further due to the abundance of real estate mortgages. (Or borrowing from foreign countries to rediscount real estate mortgages as collateral.) If a proper solution can be found to rediscount real estate mortgages, it can temporarily alleviate the current financial crunch.</p>
<p>Land Reform Measures:  You have likely already seen the real estate mortgage reform measures proposed by this bureau. The bureau's measures have been submitted to the municipal government and then to the national government. The main points are that within this city, land that has been surveyed, proven in ownership, and issued a land license, or land with a water tax deed, when setting up a mortgage, and that has been registered with the Land Bureau in accordance with the Shanghai Real Estate Mortgage Registration Regulations, may implement mortgage rights in accordance with these measures. If the mortgagee has not been repaid when the debt is due, they may directly hand it over to an auction house for execution, or if there are disputes over the mortgage, they can sue the Land Bureau Tribunal. Before the establishment of the Land Tribunal, it will be transferred to the court for handling. If necessary, the mortgagee shall provide a corresponding guarantee and directly implement the conditions for the auction.</p>
<p>Deficiencies of Current Laws: Regarding the execution of mortgage rights, the current legal trial procedures seem to be lacking. The land reform proposed by this bureau aims to rationalize the current land system to protect the interests of both mortgagors and mortgagees. In the future, the registration procedures for land deed buyers and land certificates must be complete and unified. Under the current perpetual lease system, when land transactions are transferred, there is no formal registration in the consulate and the Land Bureau. The registration of registered owners is neither complete nor unified, which is not a good system. If all real estate mortgages can be registered in the Land Bureau, in the future, it will be easier to find the real legal owners and reduce the number of people who borrow money by obtaining deeds through fraud or illegal procedures. If the owner loses the land certificate, there will be a guarantee in the future. The mortgagee who lends money will not trade with illegal owners, because the mortgage has been registered, so there is no doubt that the mortgagor is the legal owner. In the future, if the mortgagor fails to fulfill the contract and repay the debt when it is due, the mortgagee can naturally execute the auction of the mortgaged property with the approval of the administrative agency.</p>
<p>Avoid Litigation: If the registration method is adopted, the current shortcomings can be avoided, and litigation cases can also be reduced. Except for disputes over auctions or objections to the mortgagor's property rights, there is no need to go through the court. The most perfect land system is the Torrens system. This system was created by Sir Torrens and first promulgated in Australia, and later adopted by the United States and other countries. According to this system, land deeds are guaranteed by the government, and all kinds of transfers, such as mortgages, liens, etc., must be recorded in the land deed. Regarding this system, an author commented, "Land must be registered to determine property rights, and all kinds of transfers and liens must be recorded in detail and certified by the owner's registration certificate. Once the owner is registered, the property right is fixed, and the fees should be light, and the handling should be fast to be considered perfect." In the land practice certificate, many of the advantages of this system can be cited. For example, if the perpetual lease only has a registered owner and no original owner, it can also be adopted. All transfers are recorded in one contract, which is very good. Therefore, it is helpful to learn from other countries' experiences in land reform.</p>
<p>Standardized Measurement: Since I took office, I have tried to reorganize all the old habits. For example, the measurement method must be consistent with that adopted by the authorities in the concessions. In the past, the measurement of the municipal government and the authorities in the concessions were different. In the future, we should cooperate with all parties to strive for reform. In the study of land issues, the issue of landlords and tenants cannot be ignored, especially recently there has been advocacy for rent reduction. Although this belongs to the scope of the Social Bureau and has nothing to do with the Land Bureau, I am also in charge of finance. Any impact due to rental matters that may indirectly hinder the municipal government's tax revenue and the concession's revenue is specifically pointed out to seek the attention of the community. The authorities in each concession should invite enthusiastic and reputable citizens to form a committee to specialize in studying the problems of landlords and tenants and related legal issues. I hope that you will work together to make up for the shortcomings and jointly plan to improve the land system in Shanghai. This is not only a glorious implementation for me and the Land Bureau, but also a benefit for the entire society."</p>
<h3>Stevedores at Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Petition to Party and Government Agencies of the Two Railways, Will Petition the Ministry of Railways Soon</h3>
<p>Stevedores at Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway dispatched representatives the day before yesterday (the 14th) to petition the Party Headquarters, Administration Bureau, and Trade Union of the Two Railways, requesting the revocation of the bidding order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. They will petition the Ministry of Railways soon. The original text of their petition to the Ministry of Railways is recorded below: The petition is for upholding justice. It has been learned that the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has tendered for the handling of stevedoring affairs at Wuxi Station. The workers have suffered from exploitation by contractors for a long time and cannot bear it. They implore the Railway Administration to revoke the order and allow the workers to handle the affairs themselves. It has been learned that there are more than 200 stevedores at Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, who have always been law-abiding and have never had any accidents. However, the most painful and urgently sought after relief for the workers themselves is the exploitation and oppression of the contracting system. It has been found that the stevedoring work at Wuxi Station has been contracted by Meng Jinsun and then subcontracted to Tao Ziming. Under the double oppression of the workers, they have suffered all kinds of hardships. In June of this year, they listed the exploitation of workers by the contractors and petitioned the Ministry and the Party and government agencies of the Two Railways to investigate and deal with it. The contractors Meng Jinsun and Tao Ziming still used the money they obtained from exploiting the workers to carry out large-scale activities. As a result, not only did the workers' suffering not disappear, but the contractors also oppressed them more because they resented the workers' accusations. In order to get rid of the shackles and protect their property, the workers again sent representatives to the Ministry and the Central Party Headquarters in September of this year to petition for joining the Trade Union of the Two Railways, which was approved. They registered in November. The workers were celebrating the maintenance of the parties and were thinking of asking the Party and government agencies of the Two Railways to lift the shackles and grant relief. However, the Administration Bureau of the Two Railways suddenly published an advertisement on the 12th of this month to tender for the handling of stevedoring affairs at Wuxi Station. The workers were shocked when they heard the news. No matter who wins the bid, in short, once the bidder wins the bid, their exploitation of the interests of the workers and their illegal actions of oppressing the workers will inevitably increase. Moreover, it is said that Tao Ziming is using various destructive methods in the hope of cutting off the lives of the workers. The workers have not been liberated at all, but have increased their suffering. How can this be allowed under the rule of the Qing Dynasty and the White Sun Party? Moreover, the stevedoring fees at each station have long been stipulated by the Ministry and are different from the construction of houses or the purchase of equipment, so there is no need to tender for the handling. The stevedoring workers of the Two Railways often have major labor disputes due to competition for work. Recently, such as the Shanghai Shangbei Freight Station and the McGonagall Road Freight Station, bloody tragedies have been caused by competition for work. Only Wuxi Station has never had any labor disputes since stevedoring. It can be seen from this that the workers have been abiding by their duties. However, things must turn around when they reach the extreme, and injustices must be expressed. The workers have been oppressed by the contractors to the point where they can no longer tolerate it. If the Administration Bureau of the Two Railways rashly tenders for the handling of this matter, then in order to seek the lives of hundreds of workers and more than a thousand family members, the workers will definitely fight to the death. In addition to sending representatives to the Administration Bureau of the Two Railways, the Special Party Headquarters of the Two Railways, and the Trade Union of the Two Railways to petition, it is reasonable to petition the Ministry to quickly uphold justice, order the Administration Bureau of the Two Railways to revoke the bidding order, and allow the stevedoring affairs of Wuxi Station to be handled by the workers themselves in accordance with the precedents of the Shangbei Freight Station and the McGonagall Road Freight Station, by organizing affairs or cooperatives. The workers will also strictly abide by all legal regulations stipulated by the Railway Administration. We implore you to approve it to benefit the workers and avoid incidents. We are extremely eager to await your orders. We respectfully submit this to the Minister of Railways.</p>
<h3>The Bankers Association Will Amend Its Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association believes that since the Ministry of Finance announced the improvement of the currency system on November 3 of this year, Article 5 of Chapter 4 "Standard Currency" of the industry regulations, which states that "All receipts and disbursements shall comply with the Ministry of Finance's order of April 6, 1933, and shall be in silver coins," seems to require amendment. It is reported that the standing committee members of the association have found ways to revise the wording of this article and will submit it to a meeting for decision.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Economic Downturn, Lao Tongkang Grocery Store is Liquidated</h3>
<p>Lao Tongkang North-South Grocery and Seafood Store on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, Public Concession, has been open for many years and has been doing well. Recently, due to the impact of the economic downturn, its financial resources have become unsustainable. It has already ceased operations, announced its liquidation, and the owner, Gu Jiliang, has hired lawyer Shi Qinghua to notify all creditors to register at Shi's Law Office, No. 2 Min Shenfang, Mintiniyin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, within 14 days. All debtors are also required to repay within 14 days. Those who wish to acquire the store's assets and goods are also requested to contact the lawyer's office.</p>
<h3>Social Economic Research Institute Publishes: Rice Prices in this City Last Quarter Fell Compared to the Same Period Last Year</h3>

Your brilliance surpasses the crane's perch. Your writing arises like dragons and winds, nurtured in the beauty of Dongtai, famous throughout the seas. As a child, you possessed righteousness; as an adult, you embraced great aspirations. You worked diligently in the press, faithfully serving, tirelessly burning the midnight oil. You collected news, compiled histories of journalism, and wielded a pen like a beam, receiving unanimous praise. Renewing yourself day after day, for fifteen years, you were still dissatisfied, constantly striving forward. Breaking the waves and riding the wind, you traveled thousands of miles across the oceans, attending the League of Nations expert conference, carefully examining and designing. You traveled to Europe again, earning international acclaim. You visited five or six countries, covering over eighty thousand miles. This year, on October 15th, you returned to Shanghai, intending to go to Nanjing on the 31st. Unexpectedly, on the 19th, you fell ill with peritonitis and were admitted to the Shanghai Sanatorium for surgery. You passed away in the hospital on the 22nd. The nation faces difficulties, losing such a virtuous and wise man. When the bad news arrived, everyone shed tears. It is not just those who knew you who are saddened and weep. Alas, Gongzhen, what kind of world is this? Summer greens are carved by frost, spring reds are shattered by hail. Grand plans have not been realized, and ambitions have entered the earth. Heaven has lost a wise man, and the world has lost a patriot. Although your soul has departed, your spirit is immortal, transforming into blue jade and penetrating the rainbow, no different in the realms of light and darkness. Accomplishing your aspirations is the task of those who survive. We hope your spirit will be as firm as gold and stone. We offer clear wine in a full cup and fragrant incense. May your spirit find rest here. Alas, alas, take your ease."</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech: During the memorial service, Pan Gongzhan, the chief officiant, delivered a speech stating: "Today marks the day of Mr. Gongzhen's burial. Colleagues have initiated this memorial service to express our condolences. Mr. Ge's thoughts and opinions are already scattered throughout his writings and need no further elaboration. As for the significance of memorializing Mr. Ge, there are approximately two points. First, during this period of severe national crisis, the people of the nation should strive in their own professions and seek the revival of the nation. Mr. Ge devoted himself to journalism, remaining committed to the press throughout his life. His spirit of striving in his profession is truly a model for the people of the nation. Memorializing Mr. Ge is to promote this spirit. Second, during this time of national crisis, Mr. Ge resolutely returned to the country, determined to save the nation by striving in his profession. This great spirit is also sufficient to awaken the colleagues in the press, so that they may strive in their own professions. Finally, he emphasized that Mr. Ge devoted his life to social causes, and his burial in the public cemetery today is also a commemoration of Mr. Ge's intentions. He thanked Mayor Wu for donating the land and presented the report on behalf of the funeral committee."</p>
<p>Ge's Biography: Xia Qifeng then reported on Ge's biography, briefly stating: "Mr. Ge, named Ge Shaofa, initially styled Chunpu, later Gongzhen, was from Dongtai, Jiangsu. At the age of five, he entered a private school. At fourteen, he went to work outside. When the Qing court abolished the imperial examination system, he entered school. At nineteen, he followed his uncle on official travels. In the first year of the Republic, Mr. Ge assisted in editing the Dongtai Daily. In the second year, he entered the Shanghai Youzheng Bookstore and also wrote articles for the Shibao. Soon after, he served as the local editor of the Shibao and was later promoted to editor-in-chief. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, he used his personal savings to travel to Europe, America, and Japan to study journalism, attending various international journalism conferences. After returning to the country, he served as the design director of the Shen Bao's General Management Office. During the September 18th Incident, Mr. Ge accompanied Representative Gu Weijun and the League of Nations investigation team to the northeast, where he was briefly arrested. In the twenty-first year, he traveled to Europe with the team. In addition to serving as a special correspondent for the Central News Agency, he was also entrusted by the Shanghai Daily News Association and the press in Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places to attend the International Journalism Conference in the capital of Spain. He also traveled to Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and other countries, covering over eighty thousand miles. On October 15th of this year, he returned to Shanghai, originally intending to go to Nanjing on the 31st. Unexpectedly, on the 19th, he fell ill with peritonitis and was admitted to the Shanghai Sanatorium for surgery. He passed away in the hospital on the 22nd."</p>
<p>Collection of Condolence Speeches: After Xia Qifeng reported on Ge's biography, condolence speeches were delivered by Wang Boqi, general manager of Xinwen Bao, Ma Yinliang, manager of Shen Bao, Yan Duhe, standing committee member of the Shanghai Journalists Association, Xiao Tongzi, president of the Central News Agency, and Ling Qihan, former chargé d'affaires in Belgium. Wang Boqi briefly stated: "We mourn Mr. Ge Gongzhen not only for the sake of friendship, but also for the future of journalism, which has lost a brave general. Mr. Ge's aspirations and the mission entrusted to him by all sectors of society were, on the one hand, to devote himself to foreign publicity, and on the other hand, to observe and collect the cultures and advantages of various countries overseas and introduce them to our country. Unfortunately, he passed away after returning from his study abroad, only halfway through his aspirations and mission. This should make us all feel especially sad today." Ma Yinliang briefly stated: "Mr. Ge has made many contributions to the press. I have worked with him for many years. Journalism is the most arduous and busy profession. Ge was able to endure hardship and struggle, never wavering, which I deeply admire." Yan Duhe briefly stated: "The life of a journalist is particularly difficult, and their experiences are often unparalleled by others. There are journalists who are buried in a single newspaper for their entire lives, unable to fully develop their original talents. There are other journalists who disdain to devote themselves to the press for so long. Mr. Ge is one who did not wear out his talents in the newspapers, but the result was still to serve journalism. Ge believed that one of the shortcomings of our country's press was a lack of international publicity and specialized talents, as well as a lack of excellent introductions and improvements. Ge has already done his best to address the first point and was about to proceed with the second point when he passed away, which is deeply regrettable." Xiao Tongzi briefly stated: "Mr. Ge's last trip abroad was as a special correspondent for our agency (Central News Agency). I accompanied Representative Gu to Europe, hoping to contribute to national diplomacy. Mr. Ge's clearly worded telegrams and messages have been published in newspapers across the country through our agency and need no further elaboration. Although our agency did not provide him with particularly generous treatment, Mr. Ge was content with his simple life and was able to make do. Although I met with Mr. Ge twice after his return to Shanghai, the time was too short to say everything I wanted to say. According to Mr. Ge, there were many things he learned from his study abroad that could be used as a model for our agency, but unfortunately, they were all left in his mind or in his luggage and were not organized, which is a great pity. Mr. Ge's death is not only a loss for our agency, but also a loss for the entire press of the country." Ling Qihan briefly stated: "Mr. Ge did not write much, but what he did write was of high quality. He did not say pretty words or sing high-pitched songs. Everything he did was done with a practical attitude. His purpose in going abroad was for publicity and study, as well as to introduce our country's culture."</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements: Huang Jiping, representative of the funeral committee, reported on the funeral arrangements, stating: "Since the establishment of the funeral committee after Mr. Ge's death, there have been ten meetings, and all of the decided matters have been completed. Therefore, I will briefly report as follows: The cemetery plot was donated by Mayor Wu and is quite large, allowing for the future construction of a memorial hall, etc. The construction of the tomb was undertaken by the Shanghai Stele Company at a cost of approximately eight hundred yuan. After the整理 of Mr. Ge's works, Life Bookstore has published "From the Northeast to the Soviet Union." Another book, "Notes on the Soviet Union," will also be published by the bookstore. The funeral committee's expenses totaled over 1,700 yuan. Over 1,100 obituaries were sent out. The income from condolence gifts was approximately 4,000 yuan, leaving a balance of 2,000 yuan, which will be used for the education of Mr. Ge's children. It is proposed to raise a large sum to establish a scholarship in Mr. Ge's name in order to commemorate Mr. Ge forever. The funeral committee has now concluded its work. It is hoped that Mr. Ge's close relatives and friends will form a committee to oversee the remaining matters." Ge's brother, Shudong, then delivered a speech of gratitude and bowed to the guests. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM. It was also learned that the Jiangsu Journalism Society resolved that newspapers throughout the province would issue a special edition on the day of Mr. Ge's public funeral to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year's Day: High Tide Expected in Shanghai - Prediction by the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau's Hydrology Department - Time Expected to Be Around 1:00 PM</h3>
<p>According to the prediction by the Hydrology Department of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, on the 24th of next month (i.e., Lunar New Year's Day), a high tide is expected in the Huangpu River. The quantity of flow will be above ten feet, making it the highest tide of the winter season. If the weather is bad at that time, the quantity of flow may exceed even more, and low-lying roads will inevitably be flooded. The Datong News Agency reporter has pre-recorded the tide's timing and quantity as follows: On the 24th of next month, the high tide will begin rising at 11:05 AM. At 12:05 PM, the rate of rise will suddenly become rapid, with a water flow rate of 1.8 nautical miles per hour. By 1:00 PM, it will have reached its highest point, with a predicted height of ten feet and three inches. The ebb will begin at 3:25 PM and will be completely receded by 10:00 PM. According to investigations, the reason is that at 3:18 PM that afternoon, the moon will be in its full phase. Three days later (the 27th), the moon will also be closest to the Earth, causing a surge in the tide. It is also reported that on the 25th and 26th, the tide level in the Huangpu River will also be unusually high.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather Leads to Desperate Measures: Poor People Risking Everything - Snatching Buns and Pancakes, Robbing Six Pairs of Cotton Pants</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather in Shanghai has been freezing cold, and beggars on the streets have no clothes to keep warm and lack food to fill their stomachs. Several people die from the cold every day. In recent days, in the Nanshi area and other places, there have been groups of emaciated people, barely covered in rags, gathering in groups of twenty or thirty, or forty or fifty, snatching buns, pancakes, and other foods from snack shops along the way to fill their stomachs, without exception. When police sirens are heard, the food has already been eaten. The shop owners suffer unexpected losses for no reason and can only lament helplessly. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Zhang Bingji New Clothing Shop at No. 2 Chuiyu Lane, Huining Road, Nanshi, hired two rickshaws to transport 300 sets of newly made cotton-padded jackets and pants to the Wanyuanxiang Foreign Goods Store on Nanjing Road for delivery. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaws passed the intersection of Huafa Road outside Xiaogongmen, a group of ragged people suddenly rushed up, blocking the rickshaws. They drew sharp knives, cut the ropes, and scrambled to seize the goods. By the time the police arrived to arrest them, the people had already fled without a trace. As a result, six pairs of cotton-padded pants were robbed.</p>
<h3>University Students Publish Shadow Dance Magazine - Publishing Obscene Content - Fined 150 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>Zou William and Zhao Ziang, both from Shanghai, recently co-published a shadow dance news magazine, establishing their office at No. 42 Yile Lane, Tangshan Road, at the Huishan Printing Bureau. Issue 20 of the magazine contained the article "Two Women Cross-Dress, Spring Colors Fill the Room," and Issue 21 contained the article "Prostitute Meets Scholar, Interesting Events in the Bedroom," the content of which was extremely obscene. After the Political Department of the Public Concession Police Force reviewed the content, it immediately requested that the First Special District Court issue summonses. Yesterday, Zou and Zhao were summoned for questioning. Only Zou appeared in court, while Zhao sent a lawyer to court. First, Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the Police Force, stated the facts of the case, saying that after the Police Force discovered the two articles, they ordered an investigation. According to staff at the Huishan Printing Bureau, the two defendants were the editors-in-chief. The two defendants were also students at St. John's University. The Police Force believed that the defendants, as students, did not seek progress in their studies but instead frequented places of entertainment and brothels and wrote content that harmed good social morals. Therefore, they were prosecuting them under Article 235, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, requesting that they be punished accordingly. Zou William confessed that Zhao Ziang only edited a film and that the content prosecuted by the Police Force was due to a momentary oversight. He requested leniency. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the confession and immediately sentenced Zou William and Zhao Ziang to a fine of 150 yuan each. If they were unable to pay the fine, they would have to serve one day of labor for each yuan.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Firm Scams: Five More Accomplices Arrested - Bringing the Total Number of Arrests to 28</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Force recently arrested 23 suspects, including Chen Guorui, involved in the fraudulent Yu Yu Yong, Shunchang, and Yuchanglong firm names, and Yusheng Money Exchange.

<h3>Kuang Buyang: Practicing Medicine with a Purchased Diploma - Discovered by the Public Security Bureau and Arrested on Haining Road</h3>
<p>Kuang Buyang, a Guangdong native, admired the potential of being a doctor and spent over 200 yuan to purchase a medical diploma. Exploiting the special status of the concession, he set up a practice at No. 444 Haining Road, treating patients. He had been practicing for a long time without being exposed. Recently, his secret was discovered by detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Considering the importance of the medical profession and the fact that someone without medical knowledge could not be allowed to practice medicine, the bureau chief sent a letter to the First Special District Court requesting assistance with the arrest. The court issued an arrest warrant and dispatched detectives to arrest Kuang. He was brought to court yesterday, where he was interrogated by Judge Jiang Shuzi. Kuang admitted that he had purchased his medical diploma for 250 yuan. The court then ordered that Kuang Buyang, along with the diploma and other items, be handed over to the officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

In addition to notifying the village chief to report to the Shanghai Local Court and dispatching a prosecutor to conduct an on-site examination, they also reported to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau to request that they investigate and apprehend the culprit.</p>

Among them were two female bandits who pretended to be customers. Three male bandits broke into the shop, brandished two pistols, and threatened the accountant and staff not to make a sound and to comply with their actions. They then opened the cash register, grabbed over 200 yuan in banknotes, and fled through the door. The two female bandits also followed.

<h3>City's Shelters for the Poor: Opened Yesterday - Soup Kitchens to Open Early - Charity Fair Postponed</h3>
<p>Due to the sudden cold weather and the increasing number of homeless elderly, weak, women, and children freezing to death, the United Charity Organization of Shanghai has opened the Hunan Shelter for the Poor yesterday (the 15th). In addition, the Zhabei Soup Kitchen will also open early due to concerns about the cold weather and the freezing and starving of women and children. Furthermore, the charity fair organized by the Relief Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces has been postponed for one month. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Shelter for the Poor Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>After the United Charity Organization commissioned Zhang Zixin to be in charge of the Hunan Shelter for the Poor, the internal organization has been prepared. It has been agreed that the Chaozhou Association at the South Railway Station will be the first shelter and the Chaozhou Huishan Zhuang on Xietu Road will be the second shelter. The construction of sheds and internal arrangements has been extremely busy. After the arrangements were completed the day before yesterday, the shelter began receiving people from yesterday (the 15th). By noon today, five women and children have been received. In addition to the 2,000 yuan allocated by the Municipal Government, the shelter hopes that people from all walks of life in the city will actively help.</p>
<p>Soup Kitchens to Open Early</p>
<p>In addition, the Zhabei Charity Organization's soup kitchens, all located at the Yangying Road soup kitchen site, have been repaired by hired workers. According to Wang Binyan, the director of the organization, who spoke to the Daily News reporter, the organization is trying to expand the site due to last year's overcrowding. Furthermore, the closing date, which was originally scheduled for the 25th, will be brought forward as soon as possible due to the cold weather. As for the quantity of soup provided, it will depend on the situation due to the difficulty in raising funds this year.</p>
<p>Charity Fair for Disaster Victims Extended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces also believes that, with the arrival of severe winter, the situation of the disaster victims is extremely miserable and they should be provided with relief quickly. Therefore, Li Dachao, head of the fundraising group of the association, initiated a general donation campaign, entrusting various shops, companies, banks, and money exchanges in the city to help raise funds. Since the beginning of the campaign, the results have been quite good. However, the original deadline, which was not fixed, has been extended for one month to the end of next month due to the urgent need for relief for the disaster victims in the severe winter. The Water Disaster Association has already notified the various fundraising agencies.</p>
<h3>Major Construction Projects such as the Municipal Hospital: Can Be Opened Sequentially Only Next Year - Aviation Association Around February or March, Hygiene Testing Laboratory, etc. Must Wait Until Summer</h3>
<p>Due to the large scale of the various major construction projects in the city center, the plan to gradually complete them this year will not be achieved due to the limited time. They must wait until next year to be fully completed before a date can be selected and preparations made for the opening. According to reporters' inquiries with the municipal government, the new site of the Chinese Aviation Association has almost completed the exterior walls. The site is shaped like an airplane and is quite majestic. However, the entire project will likely not be completed until January of next year. It will be necessary to complete the installation of internal odds and ends before it can be opened, which should be around February or March. The construction of the buildings for the Municipal Hospital and the Hygiene Testing Laboratory is expected to be completed by the end of the month, but the installation of electric lights, sanitary facilities, and internal engineering will have to be completed in the spring of next year. As for the purchase of medical equipment, the layout of internal wards, and the necessary equipment, it will not be accomplished before the summer of next year. Therefore, the opening date will be in June or July of next year. As for other construction projects related to construction undertakings, the municipal authorities are actively planning them.</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Association - Seeking to Aid Female and Child Beggars</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Women's Temperance Association, noting the widespread presence of female and child beggars in the city and their extreme suffering from hunger and cold during this severe winter, has specially appointed Ms. Liu Juxian, Ms. Wu Wenqing, and Mrs. Cai Bingjiu to depart today for various streets. They will give a few copper coins to any female and child beggars they encounter, engage in conversation to inquire about why they became beggars, and issue a relief certificate with the inscription: "Present this certificate to the Shanghai Beggar Relief Association, and you are guaranteed food and clothing." The beggars can present the certificate to register at the Beggar Relief Association located at 2 and 2A Seward Road, after which the association will send them to the Jiangwan Women and Children's Relief Home for care. It is said that the home can accommodate 500 people.</p>
<h3>Liaoyang Road Kidnapping Case - Body of Chauffeur Han Yueqing Discovered - Strangled to Death by Kidnappers - Body Largely Intact but Face Mangled by Wild Dogs - A Grisly Sight</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Public Concession Police Department suddenly received an anonymous letter stating that the missing driver of the Lilli Motor Company, who disappeared in the kidnapping case on Liaoyang Road in the Public Concession area on the 12th of this month, was now found deceased in a deserted field on Anhe Temple Road in the western district of Shanghai. Upon receiving this anonymous letter, the Police Department immediately dispatched detectives in patrol cars to search Anhe Temple Road, where they indeed found the body of the missing Lilli Motor Company driver, Han Yueqing, in a deserted field. Han Yueqing had been strangled to death by the kidnappers, making the state of his corpse particularly gruesome. Moreover, it appeared Han's body had been placed there for some time, as his face had been partially eaten away by wild dogs. After discovering Han Yueqing's body, the Police Department detectives immediately transported it to the Perrin Road Morgue for examination. A report will be submitted to the Shanghai First Special Court Prosecutor's Office today, requesting the dispatch of personnel for inspection. Reporters from the Hua Dong News Agency learned that Han Yueqing, the Lilli Motor Company driver who was strangled to death and whose body was found on Anhe Temple Road, was a native of the city, 32 years old, residing on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, with a wife and children. He had been employed at the Lilli Motor Company for over three years. Yesterday afternoon, after receiving notification from the Police Department, the Lilli Company immediately informed Han Yueqing's wife, instructing her to go to the Perrin Road Morgue today to collect Han Yueqing's body.</p>
<h3>Liquidation of Huang Chu-jiu's Assets Concluded After Four Years of Delay - Net Surplus Estimated at Nearly 170,000 Gold Dollars - Second Special Court Convenes Creditors' Meeting - Accountants Request 20,000 Yuan in Liquidation Fees</h3>
<p>Following Huang Chu-jiu's death in the winter of the 19th year of the Republic, the Gongfa Company, Riyeh Bank, and Dashijie Amusement Park, all founded by him, as well as his real estate companies, shops, and other ventures, simultaneously collapsed and ceased operations. Debts totaled over two million yuan. Various creditors, represented by lawyers, filed lawsuits with the former French Concession Court to seek repayment. The court appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to liquidate the accounts. Huang's family also surrendered all private property to be used for debt repayment. An initial dividend of 20% was paid to creditors. Subsequently, the Second Special District Court took over the case. Due to the complex and tangled nature of the debts and credits, as well as disputes over priority and ordinary claims requiring litigation, and the fluctuations in the market affecting the court's auction of Huang's public and private real estate and movable assets, all debt repayments have been delayed for four years. Accountant Pan Zhaobang has completed the liquidation, and after deducting secured debts for China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Wanchun Banking Group, and other four priority creditors from the proceeds of the sold assets and other income, a surplus of nearly 170,000 gold dollars remains, which can be distributed among ordinary creditors. A report was submitted to the Second Special Court for instructions. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Second Special Court Executive Judge Yang Ding, accompanied by clerk Wu Shan, convened a creditors' meeting in the Fifth Tribunal to distribute the debt amount. Attendees included nearly 30 people, such as creditor representative lawyers Xu Yannian, Dong Yu, Dong Chi, Zhou Xiao'an, Bian Jialu, Wang Shizong, Ye Changyi, and creditor representatives. After the judge announced the accountant's report and distribution figures, the representative of the American-China American Tobacco Company, which was owed over 300,000 yuan by Huang Chu-jiu's Fuchang Tobacco Company, demanded that, as the court had ruled in their favor and included them in the creditor group for execution and repayment, they should first receive the 20% dividend previously paid for Gongfa Company and other debts, which Huamei Company had not received. They requested that the previous 20% of the debt be compensated to Huamei Company from the total amount to be distributed, and then the remaining amount should be distributed to each creditor. Furthermore, accountant Pan Zhaobang requested a payment of 20,000 yuan for liquidation fees, stating that 50,000 yuan in public funds had already been received for Gongfa Company. The 20,000 yuan requested now was for fees for liquidating Huang's private property, calculated at 10 yuan per hour, and due to the lengthy period, a compromise figure of 20,000 gold dollars was being requested. The various creditor representative lawyers present generally objected to Huamei Company's request for supplementary payment of the previously issued 20% dividend. If approved and the liquidation fees were deducted, little would remain to be distributed among the ordinary creditors. Therefore, they unanimously expressed opposition to Huamei's request, asking the court to temporarily withhold it pending an appeal for legal resolution. They were understanding of the accountant's fees and requested the court to order the accountant to prepare a distribution list, distribute it to each creditor, and then make a decision. Judge Yang approved this, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Silk and Satin Industry to Destroy Old System Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, having received reports that some in the silk and satin industry were still using weights and measures of the old system, specially instructed the Silk and Satin Trade Association to promptly collect all old-system rulers and scales from its members and send them to the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures for destruction. This matter was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the trade association, in order to comply with government orders and ensure unified measurement standards, has, since the 15th of this month, been working with the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industries Trade Association and has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to take the bureau order and collect the old equipment at various addresses. Yesterday was the first day of collection, starting with the silk and satin shops and wholesale stores in the lanes of Fujian Road, Fuzhou Road, Jiujiang Road, and Nanjing Road, collecting from house to house. From morning to evening, they visited sixty to seventy shops and collected over one hundred old rulers. It is reported that some, such as Jiulan, Sanyi on Nanjing Road, Deda, Tongshun, and Yushun on Fujian Road, and Cuisheng in Chongrang Lane, Jinlunyong in Huajin Lane, Junyi in Jinghe Lane, Laoyuanxingheng, Zhenxin, Ruikang, Zhenji, and Jinji and other silk stores on Fuzhou Road, have resisted the order and refused to surrender their equipment. The two trade associations believe that these businesses are undermining the measurement policy and plan to jointly report them to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting penalties to deter others. Any businesses that voluntarily wish to destroy their old-system rulers and scales may send them directly to the two trade associations to obtain a receipt for submission to the Bureau of Weights and Measures for destruction to avoid penalties.</p>

<h3>County Government Meeting - Methods for General Reporting of Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held a tobacco prohibition meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the methods for a general reporting of opium addicts in the county. Those in attendance were: Police Chief Xu Yuyin, Education Chief Zhu Changlin, Head of the Tobacco Prohibition Section Mao Wei, chiefs of various police sub-bureaus, and patrol officers from various outposts. The county report briefly stated that the meaning of holding this county tobacco prohibition meeting is that since the general registration of opium addicts, many have naturally been able to obtain licenses in accordance with regulations, but there are still many cunning, ignorant opium offenders secretly smoking. Although the government has been leading its subordinates for a year to conduct strict inspections, and those caught are punished according to the law, unauthorized private smoking is still unavoidable. The provincial government is now aware of this situation and cannot bear to punish without educating, so they have now stipulated the general reporting of opium addicts and self-reporting registration methods in order to eliminate opium. It is hoped that everyone will assist the government in its efforts. Subsequently, the following cases were decided: It was stipulated that the period from the 21st to the 27th of this month is the publicity week for self-reporting registration of opium addicts; The dates for the tobacco prohibition meetings in each district are stipulated as follows: District 1, 1:00 PM on the 17th; District 2, 1:00 PM on the 18th; District 3, 9:00 AM on the 17th; District 4, 2:00 PM on the 17th; District 5, 11:00 AM on the 17th; The publicity methods are stipulated as follows: A. Draft publicity slogans to be printed and distributed by the county government to each district and township for posting; B. Post vernacular announcements; C. Sound gongs in each township; D. Organize publicity and lecture teams to give lectures in cities, towns, and villages, with banners bearing the words "Self-Reporting of Opium Addicts Can Avoid Punishment"; E. Publish a special publicity edition, noting that self-reporting registration for opium addicts starts on January 1 of next year and ends at the end of the month, with general reporting to be implemented in February.</p>
<h3>Shops in the Nine Acres Area Submit Petition to Public Safety Bureau Requesting Temporary Suspension of Mezzanine Demolition</h3>
<p>Director Cai of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, recognizing that the construction of mezzanines within civilian residences presents many dangers, specially ordered each sub-bureau and police station to pay close attention. Having received this order, the sub-bureaus and police stations dispatched police to summon and question residents. It is now learned that businesses such as Guanshengyuan and others on Lu Xiang Yuan Road and Qing Lian Street in the Nine Acres area of the South City have jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, requesting a temporary suspension of enforcement. The original text is copied below: "A Petition Requesting Temporary Suspension of Enforcement Due to Poor Market Conditions and High Rents, Submitted by Several Hundred Businesses Struggling to Survive by Constructing Mezzanines to Save Costs. We, the residents of the Renyi, Jizhi, and Xin lanes on Lu Xiang Yuan Road and Qing Lian Street in the Nine Acres area, have resided here for many years. The houses were formerly located on the sites of the Furun and Dejian lanes, with original rents of over 20 yuan per month. Since the reconstruction, the rents have suddenly increased by more than twofold. Since the reconstruction of these houses, we have painfully rented them, and in order to avoid the elements, most have added sheds or mezzanines to the rooftops. We have now been summoned door-to-door by the Old North Gate Police Station, causing widespread panic. Even those whose matters have been years past and whose structures are old are being ordered to demolish them. We believe that such situations are ubiquitous in Shanghai, and we are forced to do so as a last resort. In addition to jointly petitioning the Public Works Bureau for relief, we hereby submit this document to your esteemed bureau, earnestly requesting you to consider the market conditions, sympathize with the people's difficulties, and grant a temporary suspension of enforcement to allow us to eke out a meager existence. Respectfully submitted to Director Cai of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau."</p>
<h3>Fire at Da Matou Street in the South City</h3>
<p>The Hongyuantai Hat Store at No. 132 Da Matou Street in the South City, opened by Yao Shusheng from Pudong, suddenly caught fire on the ground floor around 11:00 PM the night before. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air, and the fire blazed uncontrollably, quickly piercing the roof. Fortunately, the fire brigades from various districts responded to the alarm and drove pump trucks to the scene to connect water and extinguish the fire, which was finally put out after about an hour. When the fire broke out, all the residents living upstairs were deep in sleep. When they woke up and realized what was happening, the stairs had already been burned through, so they jumped from the rear sun deck to escape and were able to get to safety. The apprentices who were sleeping downstairs had already fled. It is estimated that the fire destroyed two buildings of the shop, with no further damage. It is said that the shop had fire insurance for a certain amount. The Sixteen Pu sub-bureau is currently dispatching police officers to investigate the cause of the fire and has taken the shop owner, Yao Jisheng, to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Small Widow Poisoned by Coal Gas on Datong Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Old Maid Also Unconscious</p>
<p>Caused by Burning Coal and Sleeping with Doors and Windows Closed</p>
<p>Wang Lu, a 25-year-old woman from Suzhou, rented the front upstairs room at No. 64 Yongxiang Lane on Datong Road in Zhabei. Her husband had passed away, and as a young widow, she hired a maid, Mother Chen (52 years old, from Anhui), to keep her company and help her with tasks. Yesterday morning, when the sanitation worker came to empty the latrine, he knocked on the front door of the building. After knocking for a long time without a response, he still did not see any movement from the owner or the maid inside the house by 9:00 AM. The second landlord then knocked repeatedly but still heard no sound, realizing something was amiss. He pried open the windows and entered the room, finding that the owner and the maid were pale, and the room was filled with coal gas. There was a coal stove in the corner. It became clear that they had been poisoned by coal gas. He immediately hired a car and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>A Visit to an Electrical Factory - The Asia Electric Company -</h3>
<p>— Lou Liqi</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's electric lighting industry has been very developed. Even in remote villages, electric lights are used, and the annual consumption of light bulbs is quite considerable. Among the many light bulbs consumed, some are imported from foreign countries, such as Osram and Philips, and some are made by our own people, such as Asia Electric and Huade.</p>
<p>Asia Electric light bulbs are products of the Asia Electric Company. The Asia Electric Company is not only the pioneer in manufacturing light bulbs in our country, but also an electrical factory that specializes in manufacturing domestic light bulbs. It was originally founded by a German named Asia Electric, who rented ordinary houses on Baker Road in Shanghai to set up a factory specializing in the production of light bulbs. The scale was small, with only a few dozen workers, so the output was small and the sales were not large. On April 1, the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the German sold all the machinery and equipment in the factory and the original Asia Electric trademark to the Chinese for a price of 30,000 yuan, and then reorganized it into a joint-stock limited company. Later, it increased its capital and expanded, first buying ten mu of land on Liaoyang Road to build its own factory buildings and add machinery. The output increased day by day, and the sales also increased day by day. Then, it bought more than ten mu of land on Yangshupu Road to build the latest type of factory buildings to manufacture electric fans and electric motors. Now the factory's capital has increased to 500,000 yuan, employing more than 100 workers, with Mr. Hu Xiyuan as general manager, Mr. Zhuang Zhongwen as manager, and Mr. Feng Jiazheng as chief engineer. The main products are three types: fans, motors, and light bulbs. Fans are divided into 56-inch ceiling fans, 36-inch ceiling fans, and 16-inch desk fans. Motors range from 2 horsepower to 1/16 horsepower. Light bulbs are divided into two types: carbon filament bulbs, coke bulbs, and argon gas bulbs. The carbon filament bulb has a vacuum inside, and the filament is long and thin, making it easy to break. It emits a yellowish light. Except for remote villages, it is used less and less. The coke bulb also has a vacuum inside and emits a yellowish light, but the filament is thick and short, making it less likely to break. It is more durable than the carbon filament bulb, but because the filament is easy to volatilize, the glass shell is easily blackened. The luminosity of this type of light bulb is limited to 40 watts. Exceeding this limit will make it less durable. The argon gas bulb is also called the half-watt bulb. After the air is evacuated, the bulb is filled with argon gas and some inert gas. This type of light bulb has a fine and short filament, wound into a semi-circular shape. Because it is surrounded by argon gas, it not only emits a pure white light, but is also not easy to volatilize, and the glass shell does not blacken. As for the luminosity, it ranges from 40 watts to hundreds or thousands of watts. The light bulbs produced by the factory also have the largest sales of this type.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a group of four of us hired a car to visit the factory on Liaoyang Road. After entering the factory gate, we found a rectangular basketball court. The workshop was on the east side of the court, the office building with two floors was on the south side, and several rows of bungalows were on the east side. After the greeter led us into the reception room, we carefully admired the architecture of the entire factory. We heard neither the roar of machines nor saw the busy work of workers. It was very quiet. After a while, Mr. Li, a staff member of the factory, came into the room to greet us. Mr. Li first briefly told us about the history and content of the factory, and then led us to visit the workshop.</p>
<p>We first visited the glass department, which is where the glass shells and glass tubes used to make light bulbs are manufactured. There were four glass-making furnaces, made of bricks and mud, half above ground and half below ground. Inside the furnaces, there were powerful flames. Many workers surrounded the furnaces, engaged in the manufacture of strange and dazzling glassware. According to Mr. Li, the raw materials for these glassware are mostly made of domestic ore sand. Colored glass is obtained by combining chemical raw materials in a certain way.</p>
<p>After we finished looking at the glass department, we went to the light bulb department. The light bulb department was a large factory building. All the manufacturing procedures for the entire light bulb, including inserting the stem, attaching the filament, cutting the tube, exhausting the air, sealing the mouth, stamping the imprint, tempering the light, calibrating, and refining the filament, are all completed in this large factory building. There were hundreds of male and female workers, all busy doing different jobs. There were more than a hundred machines, none of which were very large. The smallest filament refining machine was only a foot long, and the largest air exhausting machine could only be embraced by three people. All kinds of machines, except for the filament refining, light testing, calibrating, and stamping machines, had a device with gas. Each machine was equipped with many small gas nozzles, spraying uniform and gentle flames, using these flames to insert glass stems, attach filaments, cut off excess parts, and exhaust the air from the glass shells.</p>
<h3>Testing the Degree of Light and the Durability of Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>Because of time constraints, we stayed in the light bulb department for less than 30 minutes and were unable to carefully observe the principles of each part of the work. This was indeed a regrettable thing, but we had already seen two unusual facilities. One was the calibration wheel, a huge ring wheel that was constantly rotating. The manufactured light bulbs were inserted into the round spaces on the ring wheel. As the ring wheel rotated, the light bulbs went from no light to emitting light, from dark to bright, and finally to extinguished. This machine is used to calibrate the wattage of light bulbs. Each light bulb must be calibrated. If the manufacture is not accurate and the wattage is insufficient, it will break when it rotates to a certain position following the ring wheel. The other is the equipment for testing the degree of light and the durability of the light bulbs. In the center of a small room adjacent to the workshop, there was a棚架, with several lit light bulbs suspended in the middle. According to Mr. Li, after each batch of light bulbs is manufactured, several must be selected and hung there, emitting light non-stop, to test the degree of light and the durability of the light bulbs. These two types of equipment are not available in ordinary light bulb factories. In this era of competitive sales and economic recession, the factory has 독 比 This equipment, providing convenience for customers and increasing its own credibility, is the 색 of Asia Electric.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Liu Sijun)</p>
<p>The book "The Peach Blossom Fan" written by Kong Shangren, a recluse of Qingyun Pavilion, is a famous work of 曲. The book mentions the courtesan Li Xiangjun attending the box meeting. The so-called box meeting is that "on the day of the meeting, everyone brings a set of boxes, all filled with fresh and exotic items, including seafood, jade liquor, and瓊漿," and during the meeting, "everyone compares their skills, plucking the zither strings, and playing the flute and panpipes." Such things can be said to be elegant. Today, in brothels, there is no news of such elegant gatherings.</p>
<p>In the past, there was an Italian named Robert, who, seeing that the wealthy in Italy at that time often lent money at high interest rates, causing suffering to the poor, was angered by their cruelty. He widely raised funds from philanthropists and created an organization called the Charity Loan Bank, which specialized in lending money to the poor without charging interest, only accepting their collateral. Benefiting the poor was no small matter. I say that today, there are not a few in our country who suffer from "high-interest loans." If there were Charity Loan Banks, the poor would all raise their hands and cheer. Unfortunately, this type of organization has long lost its original nature. In today's capitalist era, no one can create it.</p>
<h3>Thumb War Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>Thumb war, also known as 搳拳, is a popular drinking game. Two people face each other, each guessing the number of fingers extended and adding them up to determine the winner. The Ciyuan says: "In the Five Dynasties History, Shi Hongqi and Su Fengji drank alcohol, and the drinking game involved hand gestures, which may be the origin of today's 搳奉." Recently, I happened to read Xie Zhezhe's Five Miscellaneous Records of Chenliu in the Ming Dynasty. It says: "During the Later Han Dynasty, the generals gathered for banquets and used hand gesture orders. The method was to use the palm as a tiger's paw, the knuckles as pine roots, the thumb as a squatting owl, the index finger as a hooked halberd, the middle finger as a jade pillar, the ring finger as a hidden dragon, the little finger as a surprise soldier, the wrist as San Luo, and the five fingers as strange peaks." Then thumb war must have originated in the Later Han Dynasty. Also, "Yuan Jun of Wumen wrote a 栂經, boasting that he was unparalleled in the world, but I have never seen it. However, there is a traveler in Ban Yuequan, Deqing, who is accurate every time. Many people suspect that he has other tricks, but he actually does not. He only has a good memory. If he can remember more than ten tactics of a person, then he will be accurate in all directions. This is what is called observing the shape and watching the color, as if a thief detector obtained it." I don't know if 拇經 exists today. There are many popular editions of rare books in the market, which can be compiled and printed.</p>
<p>兩榜, 三元, 五魁, are the names of the imperial examinations, but thumb war is often called by these names, which feels very old-fashioned and vulgar. In the past, Liu Yazi and Gu Daoqiu and others formed a wine club in Lihuali and first created the use of Ci titles to replace them, because all the members were Ci writers. Such as 一斛珠, 雙雙燕, 三妹媚, 四時好, 五綵結同心, 六花飛, 七娘子, 八實妝, 九張機, 十樣花 and so on. Others use 鵲橋仙 to replace　, 龍山會 to replace nine, and 滿庭芳 to replace ten, but because they are not easy to call out and often have errors, they are not popular.</p>
<p>There is a very simple thumb war method among children in 里巷. Making a fist is a hammer, spreading the palm is cloth, and extending the middle and index fingers is scissors. If cloth meets hammer, hammer is wrapped by cloth, hammer loses. If hammer meets scissors, scissors is struck by hammer, scissors loses. If scissors meets cloth, cloth is cut by scissors, cloth loses. And there is no need to call out the names, it is called Dongyang fist. I don't know if it is a Japanese method, which needs to be examined.</p>
<p>I still remember that our Wu Xing Society, whenever there was an elegant gathering, would often make the order of catching Cao Cao at the table. Each person would draw a paper roll with the name of a general of Shu or Wei written on it and cover it up. Zhuge Liang would then order the generals to go to battle. Whenever they encountered an enemy, they would fight, and the thumb war would be used to determine the winner. The loser would drink until Cao Cao was caught. This is more interesting than ordinary thumb war. Now that the elegant gatherings have been vacant for a long time, I think about it and think about it, and I dream about it.</p>
<h3>Dancing Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Xianweisheng</p>
<p>In recent years, dance halls have sprung up everywhere. All the fashionable young men and women and social stars, who can't dance a few steps, cheek to cheek and chest to chest, can truly be said to be wonderful! Who knew that in Shanghai thirty or forty years ago, there was also a very grand dance party, and this pioneering event was actually initiated by the government, which is a bit strange. How did things come about?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the author flipped through old newspapers and saw an article in the "Shiwu Bao" entitled "Record of the Shanghai Cai Daotai Dance Party," which I found very strange! I will describe it later.</p>
<p>On the tenth day of the tenth month of the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Saturday (November 4, 1897), which was the birthday of Empress Dowager Cixi, there was a celebration as usual. Cai Daotai (name Jun not listed in the original) held a grand dance party to respect Westerners and promote relations with foreign countries, in order to respond to the grand ceremony. Cai Daotai sent out 600 invitations in advance, inviting consuls from various countries, naval admirals from England, France, and Germany, as well as Chinese and foreign gentry, merchants, ladies, etc. The address was the Yangwu Bureau in Jing'an Temple Road. On that day, thousands of bright lights and countless electric lights were hung inside and outside the bureau, illuminating it like broad daylight. The railings and doors were decorated with flags from various countries and embroidered curtains and colorful silks. The dance floor was set up in the backyard, and behind the yard was a large living room, which was stocked with a lavish Western meal to treat guests. Daotai, together with interpreter Feng Taishou, cordially greeted the guests. Western guests wore precious stars, military uniforms, or official uniforms with swords. It was very grand for a time. There was also a Western orchestra led by the band leader Fei Na. After the dinner, the dance party began, with a total of twenty決. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Where Dong Xiaowan is Buried</h3>
<p>— (Xia Hu)</p>
<p>North and South Lake, in Ganpu, is surrounded by mountains, with the sea outside. The scenery is natural. Tourists call it Small West Lake. However, compared to West Lake, it is a different kind of scenery: Chen Zhonggui of Haichang said it is like Lady Guo's lightly painted eyebrows. The two lakes are both beautiful in Zhejiang, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and neither should be favored over the other.</p>
<p>At the foot of Chicken Cage Mountain in North and South Lake, there is where Dong Xiaowan is buried. During the Rebellion in the year of Jiashen of Chongzhen, Mao Pijiang took Dong Xiaowan to live in seclusion in Yanguan, staying at the home of Hu Zhiyuan, a member of the Ministry of Justice. He ordered Dong to collect all books and utensils. When King Fu summoned him to be Sili, he refused and moved to Dabaiju outside the city. He then went to Reshan Village in Ganpu, living in thatched huts and fishing boats, moving once a month or once a day. He died at Ma'anshan when he encountered a large army. Fortunately, he escaped in a small boat, and his family was spared. It is said that when Mao and Dong lived in Reshan, they often went to North and South Lake for fishing. The beauty and the famous scholar shone together for a time. Xiaowan also once buried fallen flowers by the lake, which was passed down as a good story. It is said that to the north of Ganpu, south of Danshui Village, there is a bridge called Kangkai Bridge, which was Dong's former residence. Mao took refuge in Reshan because it was close to Dong's former residence. This is not without reason. I will record it for scholars to investigate.</p>
<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-two: The Knight's Words Move Her Rosy Lips, a Gathering of Beautiful Women Discuss Matters, a Frightening Moment, the Jade Wrist Trembles, a Poor Woman Escapes from Prison</p>
<p>In fact, whether to ask them or not makes no difference. Our Madam has already invited many female guests to the main living room here to hold a meeting to discuss this matter. Bei Hai jumped and said: Really? That's great. Saying that, he stopped talking to Fang Dade, immediately turned around, and ran towards the main living room. Just as he reached the corridor, he heard a delicate female voice speaking there. She said: Standing from the perspective of women, if we cannot save such a woman, it is our shame. In any case, we must first establish women's personality. To establish women's personality, we must not allow women to be used as playthings by others. Bei Hai listened and felt that what this female guest said was really energetic. He quickly made a big detour, went to the back of the main living room, lay on the windowsill, and looked inside through the glass. He saw that a large dining table was surrounded by women. The woman who was speaking was still standing up in the crowd. Looking at her wearing a narrow-waisted jujube-red silk cheongsam, two mounds stood up in front of her chest, and a mound stuck out behind her buttocks. The beauty of the curves was very obvious. Although there are a few permed women in this city of Xi'an, their hairstyles are always cut very badly. This lady's hair, however, was permed very well. The top was flat, but at the ends of the hair, many layers of cloud hooks were curled up. Her face had thick rouge and powder on it, especially her lips, which were thickly painted with lip rouge. From within these red lips, a voice came out. She continued: There are many reasons why women are seen as playthings by others, but one of the reasons is that women themselves love vanity and are willing to be slaves to others. Otherwise, can men bully women? Now this Ms. Zhu is such a person. It is unlikely that she can get out of the fire pit by herself. Saying that, she held the saucer of the teacup in front of her, made a蘭花 hand gesture with three fingers, grasped the handle of the teacup, brought it to her red lips, took a sip of fragrant tea, put the cup down, then took out a square of flowered silk handkerchief from under her collar, held it in both hands, pressed it against the corners of her mouth, and wiped off the tea stains. (Three hundred and seventy-seven)</p>
<h3>Overseas Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Pei Yu)</p>
<p>The British writer George Bernard Shaw had visited Soviet Russia the year before he came to China for sightseeing. He felt particularly happy about this trip. Someone researched the reason why he was so happy and got a very interesting result. It turned out that several well-known American publishers had contacted him beforehand and were willing to pay eight shillings per word to buy his impressions of his trip to Soviet Russia. According to ordinary publications such as Pearson's Weekly, each column has about 650 words. Then Shaw could get at least 260 pounds for writing one column of text. I remember a famous American editor once said to an author who asked for one shilling per word: "Very few authors can get one shilling per word. If the fee per word is more than one shilling, that's even rarer." So Shaw getting a large fee of eight shillings per word can be said to be unprecedented in the United States.</p>
<p>The Spanish deposed King Alfonso liked to raise famous breeds of dogs the most. When he fled into exile, he left behind seven Newfoundland dogs. These dogs also knew that they had received great favor and did not forget their master. After their master disappeared, they were very depressed, even starving themselves to death. A group of important officials of the provisional government hated the deposed king and extended their hatred to the deposed king's abandoned dogs, advocating that they be shot to death. But Alcalá. Zamora, the president of the provisional government, held a different view. He said he would catch one and raise it, so the other six officials agreed, each taking one to raise, so that they would gradually forget the master who raised them before.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhisui's Trip to Chengjiang</h3>
<p>— Yongcai</p>
<p>Revolutionary pioneer Mr. Wu Zhihui, as a senior member of the party and country, is well versed in humor. And he likes to explore scenery and wander between green hills and green waters. In recent years, although he is old and respected, with a youthful face and white hair, he is still energetic and as uninhibited as ever. Seeing him traveling to the north and south, exploring the people's suffering and visiting scenic spots, his leisure and elegance are not insignificant. So everyone holds him in admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Last spring, Wu took the time to visit the author's hometown! Jiangyin. This ancient riverside county city, after the wheels of famous people, has naturally gained a lot of glory. At the same time, with Wu's humor, he has also left many interesting stories among the people. However, his whereabouts at the time were very secret, and his actions were very civilian, so apart from a few local reporters, very few people outside knew about it. Large and small newspapers have not recorded a single word about the interesting anecdotes he left in Jiangyin. The author occasionally recalls this, extracts one or two, and uses them as anecdotes. I think when Wu sees this article, he will also raise his beard and smile.</p>
<p>Wu's trip to Jiangyin was not notified in advance, so all party and government organizations were unaware of it. He left Wuxi at nine o'clock in the morning, took a Xicheng long-distance bus to Jiangyin, got off the bus, and slowly entered the city. He was wearing a blue cloth gown, a black mandarin jacket, and carrying a package. His actions were completely like those of a mainland merchant.</p>
<p>Jiangyin is not a strange place in Wu's memory. When he was young, he lived and studied with Niu Yongjian, Sun Han'ai, and others at the Nanqi Academy in Zhongjie, Jiangyin City for a long time. (Now changed to Nanqi Middle School, Wu is one of the school directors.) This time he came to Jiangyin, he really wanted to take a look at the old place where he studied in his youth, but as a result, he left in a hurry and still did not get his wish.</p>
<p>He and Jiangyin had a long history, so he still vaguely recognized the streets. However, times have changed, and in these decades, Jiangyin has also taken on a new look. After entering the city, Wu walked along the roads he remembered, all of which were the cold streets and remote alleys that were bustling in the past but now desolate. He wanted to find a restaurant for breakfast, but he couldn't find one. After being tired for a long time, he asked a passerby and got the correct directions to the bustling streets.</p>
<p>A person with a foreign accent running around in cold and remote streets is very easy to attract people's attention, so it didn't take long for the reporters to find him when he was having lunch in the restaurant.</p>
<p>His appearance is very easy to recognize. The reporters knew that he was Wu Zhilao, a member of the Central Committee, and all bowed politely and presented their cards. He told the reporters: This trip is to pay homage to the Wu Jizi Temple. Jizi was a person from the Spring and Autumn Period. The Wu clan was the ancestor, ceding the country and being very virtuous, as recorded in history. After his death, he was buried in Yanling, and his descendants built a ancestral temple next to the tomb, which is now the Shengang Township in Jiangyin. The monument was inscribed with the words "Tomb of Jizi of Yanling, Wu" by Confucius, which is a famous historical site in Jiangyin. Wu belonged to the descendants, and he loved to travel. This trip naturally had considerable significance.</p>
<p>Before Wu left the restaurant, he instructed the reporters not to spread the word to the outside world. After leaving the restaurant, he invited the reporters to accompany him to pay homage to the tomb and ancestral temple of his ancestors, using them as guides. The reporters were all very happy to agree. The reporters thought that being able to follow Wu would allow them to obtain some valuable news material. How could they know that this was Wu's humorous trick? His purpose in inviting the reporters to go with him was to supervise his actions at all times, so that they would have no way to leak the news to the outside world for a while.</p>
<p>After everyone walked out of the city, they hired a few rickshaws and set off straight to Shengang. When they reached their destination, everyone took out silver coins and scrambled to pay the fare. As a result, Wu took the lead in paying.</p>
<p>After paying homage to the ancestral temple, he took out a camera and took a group photo with everyone as a souvenir. He also took a few landscape photos. Because the reporters were invited in a hurry, none of them brought a camera with them, so apart from Wu, no one else took even a fraction of the photos to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>On the way back to the city on foot, Wu was hungry and, empathizing with others, he invited the reporters to have a simple snack in Shengang. During the meal, he smiled and said: "Although I am a member of the Central Committee, I am really a poor man. So I can only eat some cheap goods." After saying that, he smiled, took out two double coins, and paid the bill for this simple snack. Wu made treats everywhere on this trip to Chengjiang, occupying the position of the host. Isn't it a strange thing?</p>
<p>Wu Shouying, a local gentry, and the leaders of the party and government heard the news and hurried to pay their respects. Wu and his party had already arrived at the Xiwai bus station. Wu Shouying presented him with several copies of the Jiangyin County Chronicles and rubbings from steles. Wu exchanged a few polite words and shook hands in farewell, then took the bus back to Wuxi.</p>

<h3>The Result of the High Tower Cup Replay: East China Eliminates French Business School Three to One</h3>
<p>East China Always Occupies the Advantage but Lacks Excitement French Business School Finally Struggles and Scores One Goal</p>
<p>East China and the French Business School's High Tower Cup match, after ending in a 3-3 draw at Yiyuan last week, clashed again at Shenyuan yesterday. The French Business School's performance was completely abnormal. Among the back guards, only Remy Dey could be considered satisfactory, with Pell coming in second. The rest were mediocre. The forward Da Huade was absent, and Xiao Huade could not bear the burden alone. The rest of the players could not fulfill their duties. The old general Collette was originally a fierce general, but after retiring last year, his footwork and strength have both rusted and he is useless. The whole team is like a plate of scattered sand. East China's performance, although not exciting, ultimately won three to one due to the French Business School's bleak lineup. The audience was not as enthusiastic as expected, only five or six thousand people. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<h3>Excessive Fear and Panic</h3>
<p>After arranging the formation, the French Business School kicked off and attacked first. Jia Youliang passed the ball on the border, and Li Yichen first launched an attack, but retreated without success. The French Business School advanced under the command of Remy Dey. Favan got the ball and wanted to advance but was blocked. He passed the ball to Remy Dey, who picked up the ball and sent it to Dou Qu. Collette and Xiao Huade looked for opportunities to attack Dou but were unsuccessful. Both sides kicked, both having the disadvantage of being flustered and panicked. The ball path was not clear. This is a phenomenon that is unavoidable when a strong enemy is in front of you and you are excessively fearful. East China decided to attack several times. Youliang shot into the air twice, and Linjing followed suit. Yichen secretly crossed the camp and wanted to shoot near the goal, but Remy Dey rushed up and rescued the ball.</p>
<h3>The Lucky General Qiu Ting Scores First</h3>
<p>After this, for ten minutes, the ball was often in front of the Tung Wah goal. Favang was timid and unable to catch a single ball, missing many opportunities. Even when they got a corner kick, they couldn't send it in as desired. Tung Wah defended strongly. Although the French merchants attacked with all their might, there was no hope of a breakthrough, and the situation was very dull. Tung Wah's momentum seemed unable to be unleashed. They used too much force, kicking the ball not far, and their running was slow. When they reached the midfield, the ball was intercepted. It wasn't until Sun Jinshun slipped out of the gate, fighting a lone battle, that, although it wasn't effective, it boosted the team's spirit. Following this, Remy, due to the slipperiness of his feet, lost control of himself. Cao Qiuting unintentionally got the ball and shot, scoring the first goal, twenty-five minutes after the start of the match.</p>
<h3>Old Sun's Iron Leg Adds the Finishing Touch</h3>
<p>Five minutes later, Cao Qiuting got the ball on the boundary line. Because Borghes couldn't turn around in time, Cao was able to calmly approach the side of the goal and pass the ball to Yi Chen. It seemed almost certain that this ball would go in, but Yi Chen rushed too hastily and shot it high into the sky. The French merchants counter-attacked, but their forwards couldn't cooperate. Favang was like a dummy. Monot had a beautiful shot, but it was blocked by Xu Heng. Cao Qiuting's activity gave every Tung Wah forward an opportunity to move. After a pass from Cao, Sun Jinshun rushed forward from behind and shot angrily, hitting the net with a sound, incomparably beautiful. Tung Wah now had two goals.</p>
<h3>Three Goals in a Row, No Worries Behind</h3>
<p>From then on, the French merchants became increasingly chaotic, with nothing commendable in either attack or defense. Under these circumstances, Tung Wah still couldn't create a huge score difference. Switching sides to fight again, the situation was more intense. Mai Youliang's shot and Cao Qiuting's header lifted the spirits of the audience a lot. Ma Shan'er was like a dead man, almost missing a military opportunity. Tung Wah's Li Guan and others easily dealt with the weak French merchant forwards. Li Yichen, after a period of inactivity, got the ball and charged forward fiercely. Remy followed closely, but was eventually tackled by Yichen, who returned with merit. The French merchants fought hard several times, hoping for a slim chance, but Ke Laituo was old and incompetent, Bao Xiutuo was romantic and unruly, and Xiao Huate, who was known for his fighting ability, was also assimilated and powerless.</p>
<h3>Unyielding, They Score One Goal Back</h3>
<p>Tung Wah fought more and more bravely, revealing their heroic posture. The reason was that after scoring three goals in a row, they were bold and fearless, with no other concerns. The French merchants still tried their best to attack, never giving up, showing their spirit of not succumbing. In the next ten minutes, the French merchants were almost entirely in an attacking position. The competition was most intense at this time. Remy and Pei'er's attack and defense added a lot of vitality to the entire French merchant team. With their unyielding spirit, Xiao Doulu Bao Xiutuo finally got his wish and scored a goal back. The entry of this goal was like giving the French merchants a shot of morphine, and the front of the Tung Wah goal suddenly became a scene of trouble.</p>
<h3>The Final Performance Was Thrilling</h3>
<p>In the last five minutes, Tung Wah had another chance to attack, with a surging momentum, while the French merchants' resistance and defense were also more prepared than before. The overall situation was full of interest, as if this last moment would give the audience a feast for the eyes, and the fans in the stands were also focused and attentive, almost forgetting that the game was about to end. Yichen got a free kick near the penalty area in front of the enemy goal, but it was saved because his force was too weak. In the last two minutes, Tung Wah suddenly encountered a great disaster. Xu Heng was knocked to the ground while saving the ball, and the ball fell less than two feet in front of the goal. Bao Xiutuo turned around and failed to kick it in. In the chaotic situation, Tung Wah finally avoided this danger. Even if the French merchants could have obtained this ball, they would not have been able to reverse their defeat.</p>
<h3>Six to Five, Turning Defeat into Victory, Youyou Defeats Western Merchants</h3>
<p>Youyou Escapes Death After Trailing Twice</p>
<p>Western Merchant's Valiant and Skilled Howard Dingger Stands Out</p>
<p>The West Union Football Association Group A match between Youyou and Western Merchants took place yesterday afternoon at three o'clock at Yiyuan. The cold wind was biting, and the audience was sparse. Youyou's strength was greatly reduced because Xiao Heitan Chen Zhenhe was injured and did not play. They lost 1-4 in the first half. In the second half, they changed their strategy, with the whole army working hard, turning defeat into victory with a score of 5-1. The final result was 6-5, with Youyou triumphing.</p>
<h3>Liu Shizan Scores First</h3>
<p>In the lined-up confrontation, the Western Merchants took the offensive first. Howard passed the ball forward, but Chen Zhenxiang intercepted it halfway and transported it to the front. Xu Jincheng led the three armies, mightily, and rushed to the enemy. Several attacks failed to hit the target. Western Merchant's Dingger took the lead, cooperating with Howard, with long passes and short escapes, jointly forcing their way into Youyou's territory. Howard raised his hairy legs, like lightning, but Zhang Rongcai was calm and unhurried, waiting for the right moment, and was not harmed. Youyou passed the difficult situation, and the whole army was inspired. Xu Jincheng forced a corner kick. Wang Nanzhen opened it just right. Zhong Yongsen secretly fired a cold arrow. The ball hit Mike Lau and bounced back. Liu Yizan rushed out from the crowd and shot fiercely with his foot, and the record was opened.</p>
<h3>Youyou Team Loses Four Cities in a Row</h3>
<p>After the Western Merchants' loss, the whole army was filled with anger, with everyone's hair standing on end, rubbing their fists and palms, harboring the ambition to avenge their shame. Howard dribbled the ball to the front, his momentum like wind sweeping away fallen leaves, unstoppable. At that time, he was making waves in front of the Youyou goal. Howard swept the ground and the ball rolled into the corner of the net. The Western Merchants' arrogance was immense. Dingger received Howard's pass, broke through three bases in a row, and scored another goal. Howard saw this and his eyes turned red, and he scored another one. The generals of Youyou were so anxious that their faces lost color. However, Liang Shutang worked too hard and injured his leg. Enemy figures were all over the front of the Youyou goal, and the situation was dangerous. Dingger's shot hit again. Youyou's Yongsen actually colluded with the general Chengxiang, directly reaching the enemy's goal. Unfortunately, three arrows failed to reach their target, which was a pity. In the first half, Youyou was defeated 1-4.</p>
<h3>Team Leader Chen Secretly Advises</h3>
<p>After the lemon break, they switched sides to decide the victory or defeat. Youyou had already embraced the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. Team leader Chen Shao secretly advised on the spot, and then changed a large number of people. Liang Shutang served as the left inside forward, Liu Shizan was changed to the right forward, and Zhong Yongsen was also exchanged with Yu Xiang. The situation changed, and the five forwards used their lives one after another. Wang Nanzhen revolted on the border, and Xu Jincheng secretly assisted. Like a broken bamboo, the Western Merchants lost their defensive line in a row. Wang Nanzhen flew up with a kick and returned with merit. From then on, the momentum was slightly boosted, but because they were too hasty, there were several good opportunities, which were repeatedly missed. However, Youyou was not discouraged. Zhong Yongsen moved his feet, and Wang Nanzhen and Zhong Yuxiang jointly attacked. Mike Lau panicked and violated the rules, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Jincheng pulled up a kick and went straight into the net. Zhong Yongsen killed with excitement, went deep into the tiger's den, turned over, and hit the bullseye again, creating a tie.</p>
<h3>Youyou Team Escapes Death</h3>
<p>At this time, Youyou had already fought to the point of exhaustion, so the Western Merchants still acted without restraint. Fortunately, Zhang Rongcai's high and low blocks saved many dangerous balls. Suddenly, the ball was short-handed by Haite Lai to Auer, and transferred to Hou Hua. After all, the demeanor of a great general was extraordinary. He swept the ground and shot. Rongcai was greatly shocked and could not save it in time. The Western Merchants took the lead again. Youyou had to fight like a trapped beast. Yongsen and Nanzhen worked together, simultaneously forcing into the Western Merchants' territory. Yongsen raised his foot and shot hard, hitting the net with a sound. Unfortunately, the position of Jincheng, this ball was penalized and invalidated. Wang Nanzhen rose again, passing the ball from the bottom line to the center. Liang Shuye pulled up his injured leg, enduring the pain to catch up, and sure enough, he hit. At this critical moment, Xiao Huizi Yun Feng was particularly motivated, cutting a bloody path, passing it to Liang Shutang, who kicked it up, and hit again. Suddenly, the time had come, and Youyou escaped from death with a goal difference, turning defeat into victory, which was not easy. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

In the fifth game, at the critical moment of victory or defeat, both sides played even more wonderfully. Guangyi's Wei Dingyi, Mai Bingyao, and Huang Yufu's smashes were extremely good, while Shanghai Jiangsu's Li Shufen, Lu Kangyuan, Xu Senlin, and others were not weak either, and the scores were often equal.

<h3>Little Men (1)(2)(3)</h3>
<p>—Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Mrs. Jo, watching the child’s laborious harvest, and remembering all the tribulations of the night, yet still prizing it for her sake, felt a sudden impulse, and, catching her little son to her bosom, began to cry so softly, yet so bitterly, that he woke up with a start, and looked as if he did not know what to make of it. But in an instant he remembered, and clung to her, saying, with a triumphant smile, -</p>
<p>“I knew you’d come. Mother mother! I did want you!” And they kissed, and hugged, and forgot all the rest; for no matter how lost, defiled, or tired the prodigals may be, mothers can always forgive them on the instant; and the love of a son, no matter through what storms of trouble it has passed, never quite loses all its grateful tenderness.</p>
<p>At the same time, Don had roused Nan from her nook among the bushes, and was comforting her newly awakened fears with tender words and looks, wiping away the tears that would flow in spite of the joy that filled her heart; for after the utter desolation of what seemed centuries of loneliness, how good it was to see a kind face, and feel strong arms about her!</p>

<h3>Advancing Cooperative Enterprises in the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Qu Ruoqian</p>
<p>Cooperative enterprises in rural areas have recently gained a considerable foundation. Researchers and practitioners of cooperative enterprises are still actively planning how to expand them extensively in rural areas and how to promote the effectiveness of cooperatives to take on the responsibility of rescuing bankrupt rural communities. On the government side, the Ministry of Industries has added a Cooperative Affairs Department, and the National Economic Council has established a Cooperative Enterprise Committee, using administrative power to supervise the implementation of cooperative enterprises and economic power to organize cooperative enterprises that benefit the national economy. Isn't such a two-pronged approach more than enough to demonstrate the rapid progress of cooperative enterprises? However, its target is rural areas, while the fishing industry, which urgently needs rescue and improvement, is still neglected by all parties, remaining far behind other economic constructions. Recently, haven't we often seen and heard the pleas for relief from bankrupt fishermen in fishing villages? However, the cooperative enterprise, generally regarded as the center of the national economy for relief, does not intend to promote it in the fishing industry. To sum it up, fishing villages are in a state of collapse and have not yet found a savior.</p>
<p>Why has the fishing industry always been neglected and is increasingly going bankrupt? Why is the work of rescuing agriculture rising steadily, while not rescuing the fishing industry? In fact, the fishing industry itself has more difficulties than agriculture. Generally speaking, although agriculture is also subject to natural disasters, it is certainly much less than the sudden changes in the ocean. Moreover, on land, we only need to put down the seeds and diligently cultivate and irrigate to see its growth steadily, until the harvest. In the fishing industry, many fish in the ocean cannot survive in their original fishing grounds due to changes in water flow affecting water temperature and quality, or the occurrence of storms, resulting in fishermen having no harvest. Furthermore, the existence of agricultural economics is indeed more certain than fishing economics, because agriculturalists have land ownership of cultivated land (although tenant farmers and hired farmers do not have land ownership, most of those who are so-called agricultural managers must have land first), and ownership of the products harvested on the land. As for the fishing industry, fishing is carried out on the public waters of the fishing grounds, and the desired harvest—aquatic products—can be possessed by anyone who catches them. Therefore, the business community rarely invests in the fishing industry, and the banking community is even more afraid to lend to fishermen because they lack tangible guarantees, such as fishing boats and fishing gear, which are far less secure than farmers' land and property. In this situation, rescuing the fishing industry seems to be in a state of "wanting to advance but not daring to." However, is the fishing industry really unworthy of development? Does our country not need the fishing industry? Is there no possibility of developing China's fishing industry? Only by explaining these three questions can we discuss how to revive our country's fishing industry and how the fishing industry needs the promotion of cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, it can be said that no explanation is needed. The current situation shows that the oceans and rivers contain endless treasures. Any aquatic organism, in addition to being edible, can also be used to manufacture various handicrafts that we need. Therefore, we must not abandon the goods in the water without collecting them. Therefore, we have to develop the fishing industry; and in modern countries, all coastal countries pay attention to the fishing industry. Japan is the best example. Its fishing production has become one of the most important parts of economic production, and fishermen account for the third largest population in various industries. Isn't this because the fishing industry is greatly developable? As for the second and third questions, they are also easy to understand. Does China not have more than seven thousand miles of coastline? And the coast has fishing grounds that can match the world's fish-producing areas. Does it not have very abundant production? Therefore, our country needs the fishing industry, which means there is a developable fishing industry. Furthermore, our country's fishing industry has a long history, with hundreds of millions of fishermen, and the public has a habit of eating aquatic products. Then how can we not need the fishing industry, how can we abandon the fishing industry? Furthermore, in general economic terms, if the fishing industry is not developed, then the national economy will have less production income; at the same time, because there is no supply of aquatic products in the country, we have to buy as many imported aquatic products as possible, which increases the expenditure of the national economy; at the same time, the people who were originally working in the fishing industry will become a large unemployed group, which will also affect social tranquility. Regarding this point, in the current situation in our country, because we do not pay attention to the development of the fishing industry, this phenomenon has been very obvious. The increase of pirates in the outer seas is not only robbing fishing boats, but also robbing merchant ships; harassing fishing villages, and gradually developing to rob in the inland areas. According to a report a few days ago, on August 17, pirates even entered Baixiang Elementary School in Leqing County and kidnapped dozens of teachers and students. This is a very obvious fact, and the reason for the increase in pirates cannot be said to be that fishermen in the outer seas are doing this kind of business for a living, and it also proves that there is nothing to rob in the outer fishing villages, so the pirates have developed to the more inland areas. How can we not revitalize the fishing industry and stabilize the fishing villages? What's more, coastal fisheries are also related to national defense!</p>
<p>When we see the above points, we can really feel that our country cannot fail to pay attention to the fishing industry, and even more cannot fail to work hard to revive the fishing industry! Then how to revive the fishing industry? Regarding the principle of the problem, there is no need for discussion. What about the method? Cooperative enterprises can rescue bankrupt rural communities, but can't they rescue the fishing industry in the same way? If cooperatives can be promoted to the fishing industry and have a solid economic organization, it will be of great benefit to the future of the fishing industry. At this point, we hold 110,000 points of enthusiasm for the National Cooperative Enterprise Committee to allocate a portion of the funds (it is reported that 10 million yuan will be used to promote cooperative enterprises) to organize cooperatives in various industries in the fishing industry. Like Shanghai's new-style fishing industry, it lacks cooperation, and several ships have now stopped operating, and there is even talk of total bankruptcy. However, there are several companies that are profitable. If they can cooperate, they can save unnecessary expenses and increase income. Like the "North China Fishing Vessel Industry Transportation, Sales, Consumption, Savings, Insurance Limited Liability Cooperative" in Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao, the results are very good, which shows that this is very feasible. However, it is said that Shanghai's fishing vessel industry has a lot of debt, so it is hoped that the Cooperative Enterprise Committee can provide economic assistance to establish this cooperative. In addition, several important fisheries in the old-style fishing industry can also be promoted to organize cooperatives first, such as large-pair net fisheries, drift net fisheries, and Taizhou small-pair fisheries, which have a large number of fishing boats, should be organized first. Now, the large-pair fishery in Shenjiamen, Zhejiang, is preparing to organize a large-pair fishery transportation, sales, consumption, and credit cooperative, and is requesting government loans to promote it. It is heard that it has made considerable progress, and these are hoped to be realized as soon as possible. In the Cooperative Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industries, there is a systematic cooperative plan for the national fishing industry, so that there is also a unified function in the fishing industry. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the formation of fishing village cooperatives, because fishing village cooperatives are slightly different from various fishing industry cooperatives. The former takes a fishing village as a unit to include various smaller fisheries in the village, while the latter takes a fishery as a unit, and fishermen of the same nature from nearby areas can be connected into one. Furthermore, we hope that the national fisheries authorities will promote the sound development of the local fishery associations, because on the one hand, it can promote the establishment of fishery cooperatives, and on the other hand, it can help develop the future of the fishery industry.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation and Improvement of Shandong Fisheries</h3>
<p>— Ding Fengbai</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In recent years, many Chinese people have talked highly about the national economic construction movement, but most of them have neglected the aquatic economic sector. They do not understand that aquatic economy (also known as fisheries economy) is one of the factors of the national economy, that is, one of the links that constitute the national economy. Therefore, the prosperity of the aquatic economy is enough to affect the prosperity and decline of the national economy. Therefore, the importance of the aquatic economy in the entire national economy cannot be said to be small.</p>
<p>My country's coastal seven provinces have 270,000 square miles of fishing grounds, with an average annual fishing profit of 400 million yuan; (Note 1) Shandong is a major fish-producing area among the coastal seven provinces in my country. According to the latest survey, the production value of the aquatic economy in the coastal seven provinces in my country is as follows: Hebei Province 2,041,400 yuan Shandong Province 5,872,500 yuan Jiangsu Province 4,287,800 yuan Zhejiang Province 6,690,800 yuan Fujian Province 9,871,400 yuan Guangdong Province 14,914,200 yuan Total 50,000,000 yuan (Note 2)</p>
<p>In terms of the fish-producing areas in the coastal seven provinces of the country, the production value of Shandong Province alone reached 5,872,500 yuan, which accounts for a not small production value in the total production value of 50,000,000 yuan. In terms of the capital for operating fisheries in the seven provinces, Shandong's capital for operating fisheries can actually be called the first place among the seven provinces. The current fisheries capital of China is estimated as follows: (Note 3)</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the price of fishing boats in Shandong is 7,381,000 yuan, the price of fishing gear is 738,100 yuan, and the total capital is 8,119,100 yuan. Any item of capital for operating fisheries is more than the remaining six provinces. If this statistic is relatively accurate and reliable, then it goes without saying that we can infer that Shandong Province is actually one of the major fishing grounds in my country. According to the study of Shandong's coastal fish-producing areas, there are a total of 18 counties, from Diqi in the north to Rizhao in the south, with an area of no less than 2,000 miles. The general public who make a living by fishing accounts for hundreds of thousands of people. The types of marine products are of course dominated by fish, and the annual output of salted fish alone is extremely alarming. Among the 18 counties in Shandong's fish-producing area, Longkou, Yantai, Weihai, Weiqingdao...etc. are representatives. Some of the statistical village materials collected in this article are mostly limited to these places.</p>
<p>Note 1: See the preface to the combined issue of the seventh and eighth issues of the Aquatic Products Monthly.</p>
<p>Note 2: See the statistics in the article "The Status of China's Fisheries Economy" in the same issue of the same volume.</p>
<p>Note 3: See the report in the first volume of Industrial Statistics</p>
<p>Overview of Shandong Fish Production</p>
<p>The overview of Shandong's fish production is still lacking accurate statistics for the time being. Most of what is published in domestic newspapers and magazines are fragmented and incomplete, and the neglect of fisheries economy by Chinese people is generally visible here. Shandong's fish production can be divided into the following eight types according to the different types of nets used for catching:</p>
<p>(1) Gill net capture. This net is unique to China. It is most used for fishing along the coast of Shandong. Each boat can use more than 20 nets, so the operation is extremely convenient. There are more than 2,000 nets in the entire province, which are used exclusively for capturing miscellaneous fish and shrimp along the coast. The fishing season is from February to June. The fishing ground is from Damaidao to Shazikou along the coast. The fish catch is worth about 300 yuan per boat.</p>
<p>(2) Round net capture. This net is mainly used for capturing ribbonfish. There are more than 800 in the vicinity of Qingdao. Each boat carries six or seven fishermen. The locations are mostly in the waters near Shuiling Island, Zhupen Island, and Daxiaogong Island. The fish catch per boat reaches more than 100 to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Drift net capture. This net is mainly used for capturing shad, mackerel...etc. There are hundreds of fishing boats using it. The ship's carrying capacity is about 40 stone, and it can carry four or five fishermen. The fishing ground is in the waters near Talian Island and Dagong Island. The fishing season is from March to May. The fish catch per boat reaches 500 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Trawl net capture. This net is exclusively used for capturing pomfret and miscellaneous fish; the average fish catch value per boat is more than 300 yuan in a fishing season.</p>
<p>(5) Yuan net capture. This is a smaller version of the round net, mainly used for capturing squid and miscellaneous fish. The fishing ground is mostly in bays and shallow areas along the coast. The fishing season is from March to June, and each boat can obtain 150 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) Zhang net capture. This net is exclusively used for capturing lobsters. The fishing season is from March to October. This type of fishing boat is commonly known as a swallowtail boat.</p>
<p>(7) Wind net capture. These two types of nets are mainly used in the northern coastal areas of Shandong for capturing yellow croaker. There are 300 fishing boats, with an annual fish catch value of 3 million yuan. The fishing season is from March to May, but the most prosperous time is only 17 or 18 days in the middle.</p>
<p>(8) Large net capture. This net is mainly used in the coastal areas of Yantai, mostly for capturing miscellaneous fish.</p>
<p>What is the total amount of fish production in Shandong each year? Since we have no way to count it, and the Provincial Department of Construction does not have detailed reports for reference on the investigation of this fishery economy, we can only conduct investigations on Weihaiwei and Qingdao, the two major fish-producing areas among the 18 counties in Shandong, based on what is published in domestic newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>Regarding the overview of Weihaiwei's fish production, we can examine it from the sales volume and value of Weihaiwei's fish catches:</p>
<p>Table of Sales Volume and Value of Weihaiwei Fish Catches (Note 4)</p>
<p>The total number of catties of fish produced in Weihaiwei that are sold all year round is 19,656,000 catties, and the total value is 785,240 yuan; but this still refers to the number of catties that have already been sold, and the actual total amount of fish caught is of course more than this. Looking at the table of the actual amount of fish caught in Weihaiwei, we can know the general amount of its fish production.</p>
<p>Table of the Amount of Fish Caught in Weihaiwei (Note 5)</p>
<p>The above table has described the approximate amount of fish caught in each village in Weihaiwei, and it can indeed prove the large amount of fish production in Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>Qingdao is also a major fish-producing area in Shandong. All fish-producing areas in the southern Yellow Sea and northern East Sea in Shandong Province take Qingdao as the main area. The following is a table of the number of catties of fish traded by Qingdao Fisheries Company in one year:</p>
<p>Table of the Number of Catties of Fish Traded by Qingdao Fisheries Company in One Year</p>
<p>The total annual transaction volume of fish production in Qingdao is 4,003,376 catties. This is only in the Jiaozhou Bay area of Qingdao, and the actual annual output is of course more than this. If we calculate based on the amount of fish exported from Qingdao, the following table shows the amount of fish exported by Jiaohai Customs in the most recent three years: (The quantity is calculated in units of dan (hundred catties) (Note 7)</p>
<p>From the above tables, Weihaiwei and Qingdao can prove that they are the two major fishing grounds in Shandong, because the fisheries from Bohai Bay to the Yellow Sea are dominated by Weihaiwei; while the fisheries from the Yellow Sea to the East Sea are centered in Qingdao.</p>

<p>The Current Situation of Shandong's Fisheries Trade</p>
<p>Shandong's fisheries trade was not bad in the past. However, in recent years, the import of foreign marine products has been increasing year by year, so the sales volume of our country's marine products has been decreasing year by year, and the price of fish has been falling, making the future of our country's fisheries reach an extremely dangerous point. Shandong's fisheries trade is declining, especially since the implementation of the new tariff in July last year, the import of aquatic products has surged. Most of Shandong Province still has old-style fisheries, and its production cannot match foreign goods; coupled with the oppression of Japanese ships, the harassment of pirates, and the exploitation of exorbitant taxes, it has fallen sharply and cannot be salvaged. Even if there are a few new-style fisheries, they cannot have large-scale attempts due to lack of capital. In this situation, both new and old are trapped in difficulties, and it is likely that Shandong Province's aquatic product market will be completely occupied by imported goods. The main reason for this is that Shandong's fisheries have not been rectified and improved, so they are conservative and excluded. However, the decisive reason is that we cannot but say that this is due to the great blow that the new tariff has given to Shandong's fisheries.</p>
<p>(Note 8) It is found that the implementation of the new tariff has reduced the tax rate for marine products such as eel, etc., attracting a large number of imports of Japanese marine products, which has greatly reduced the price of fish, affecting Shandong's fisheries traders in three aspects.</p>
<p>The dumping of foreign loans and the low price of fish have made Shandong's fisheries more dangerous.</p>
<p>Old-style fisheries are also suffering from poor fish catches, forming a situation where cheap fish hurt fishermen.</p>
<p>New-style fisheries consume huge amounts, and the sales of fish catches are decreasing day by day. In addition, the Japanese are sparing no effort to compete for our market, making the fisheries along the coast of Shandong almost entirely controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation before the implementation of the new tariff, we can understand it clearly by citing two statistical tables of import and export trade.</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Export Value of Shandong Aquatic Products in 1933 (Note 9)</p>
<p>According to the above table, the total value of exports from the three fish-producing areas in Shandong is 224,200 yuan. Compared with the import value of the same year, we can know how pitiful the foreign trade of Shandong's fisheries economy has reached.</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Import Value of Shandong Aquatic Products in 1933 (Note 10)</p>
<p>The total value of aquatic products imported into Shandong is 856,062 gold units, which is more than five or six times higher than the export value of 224,200 yuan. Also, Longkou is not included in the statistical table of the value of export goods, because the amount of Longkou's export goods is calculated within the Yantai area. Looking at the two tables cited above, the value of export goods is so pitifully small; and the value of import goods is so terribly large! The decline and lack of vitality of aquatic economy's foreign trade clearly tells us that Shandong's entire fisheries economy and even the province's economic organization are simultaneously entering a state of decline and decay.</p>

<h3>Interbank Call Loan Rate Drops by One Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in the financial market. Market transactions tended to be sluggish. The trend of foreign call loans was downward, opening at one cent in the morning and afternoon, which was one cent lower than the previous day. Interbank call loans amounted to more than 2.8 million in the morning, and new transactions were more than 300,000. Afternoon transactions were more than 100,000. Small Clearing House transactions were more than 500,000. Money houses received more than 5.1 million in foreign public bills. Remittances from various sources amounted to more than 600,000. In subsidiary currency transactions, 35,000 Guangdong small silver dollars were traded in the morning. The black market quotation was the same as the previous day, but the morning market rose by 7 mils, and the afternoon market returned to 11 cents and 2.7 mils. 22,500 strings of copper coins and 7,500 yuan of legal tender were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities Are the Bulls of Public Bonds Really in Trouble?</h3>
<p>Need 16-17 Million Cash</p>
<p>To Monopolize and Manipulate</p>
<p>The securities market on the Chinese Merchant Exchange last week (December 9th to 14th) saw highs and lows, making it one of the most peaceful weeks in the past two months. Speculation was low, and trading was sluggish. Major players' attempts to raise prices had long disappeared, and there were signs of them taking the opportunity to sell. However, the bulls on debt consolidation bonds are in a difficult situation of being heavily burdened and unable to retreat. Although the total amount of these public bonds is only 27.5 million yuan, after deducting the millions of ten-yuan and ten-thousand-yuan tickets, the remaining is only about 20 million yuan, which can be circulated on the futures market. However, due to the high price, 16-17 million cash is still needed to sweep them all. This matter is of great importance and cannot be monopolized by the current financial situation. Therefore, the majority of No. 78 only uses tricks to confuse and collects bullish bids in order to unload responsibility by expecting the bears to hedge. However, they do not know that spot goods are flowing out steadily due to the high price. The longs are in a dilemma, and the approaching settlement is even more likely to cause huge disturbances. Observing the recent situation, debt consolidation bonds have shown signs of being unique. The situation in North China is also constantly hitting the longs. The settlement date is gradually approaching, and arbitrage transactions are not possible due to unfavorable interest rates. Given the huge amount of dependent accounts, there will be fierce competition this week. In the past week, due to the initial resolution of the situation in North China, it rose one or two cents to six or seven cents, but the tail was still three cents lower. On Tuesday, it suddenly turned to hovering, and trading was extremely sluggish. Both sides watched and waited, and the market price fluctuated between highs and lows, only two or three cents, which was rare in the past two months. Wednesday was still hovering, but there were slight drop-term transactions. Buying and selling were still sluggish, and most were slightly better by three to five cents. After the situation in North China on Thursday, Guyuan reported more troubles, and the longs were exhausted and collectively weakened, down two or three cents to eight and a half cents. On Friday, major players frequently entered and exited, and there were many drop-term transactions, which returned to chaos. The market price fluctuated between highs and lows, and debt consolidation bonds still rose. On Saturday, the market price was depressed. However, debt consolidation bonds for this month have repeatedly risen, initially at 65, and finally at 22. Most of the buying in succession was done by proxies of No. 78. The rest were all tired. The market price results for the week showed that debt consolidation bonds for this month alone rose by 1.45 yuan. One or nine Guan Shan was also good by two or three cents. The rest were all down by two or three cents to 1.34 yuan. The total transaction volume was 94.52 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton American Cotton in New Orleans Sells Off and Falls</h3>
<p>Overseas Demand Shows Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was quiet, and the prices of each month fell by one to four pounds. The news from Liverpool was poor, but the industry and foreign merchants, including the Far East, all bought in unison, so it was still able to maintain. Unfortunately, there was a lack of general demand, and the industry was still watching. The spot price was firm, domestic demand was poor, and overseas inquiries were progressing. Finally, there was a sell-off in New Orleans, and the market suddenly softened, with the spot price falling by 10 pounds and the futures price falling by 13 to 16 pounds. The spot price of British cotton rose by 3 points, and the futures price fell by 2 to 4 points. The Indian cotton market was dull, and there was a slight liquidation of long positions, with Pingger falling by 0.25 to 1.75 rupees, Omura rising by 0.25 rupees, and Bairoxi falling by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (14th telegram)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 14th was 221.5 rupees, which was 1 rupee higher than the closing price of the previous day.</p>

<p>The telegram from Alexandria on the 14th announced the quantity ginned today as left (unit: Kantar)</p>
<p>Northern Gangs Actively Organize Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, with the security situation in North China turning stable, it has aroused the interest of the Tianjin Gang. The day before yesterday, they bought a total of 1,700 bales of Japanese yarn of 16 count and 20 count from a certain foreign company. 42 count was the most popular. Chinese factory yarn was mostly 10 count coarse yarn, with 750 bales purchased. The Qingdao side ordered more than 1,000 bales of Japanese factory fancy cloth twill etc. and more than 1,000 bales of plain white cloth from a Qingdao Gang foreign company, with delivery scheduled for January and February next year. Therefore, foreign companies and Japanese factories quickly completed transactions for cotton cloth reaching 5,000 bales. In addition, Japanese factory cotton yarn in Qingdao has recently been calculated at a favorable exchange rate and transported to Harbin in the Northeast, with 300 bales shipped, which is a rare occurrence in recent years.</p>
<h3>Grains    Northern traders enjoy brisk business; price of *bo dao* rice rebounds by five cents</h3>
<p>—Zhabei spot market remains sluggish—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total supply from various trading groups was only over thirty firms (with a total of over seven thousand *shi* of goods). Sales in this district remain weak, but due to the need to fill ship holds, only over three thousand packages were shipped to Tianjin, Yantai, and other northern ports. As a result, the price of *bo dao* rice has risen by five cents. The price of thick *zao geng* rice has also stabilized thanks to this. *Du yang jian* rice shows no significant movement, but *yin bian wu* rice sees more activity. The situation seems to be modestly improving.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were fifty-five or fifty-six vessels from various routes down the river. Sales of white *geng* rice at stores in the market remain flat, with warehouses experiencing slow turnover and prices slightly down. *Zao dao* rice followed with a slight decrease, while the retail of *bo dao* rice was normal, with prices slightly less than ten cents. Though demand for *yang jian* rice is not strong, retail transactions are unremarkable, with prices down slightly. *Du jian* rice is also down slightly. There is little trading in *ke jian* rice and *yin yuan* rice remains stable. *Bai yuan* rice has seen some activity among wine merchants and continued movement for resale, with prices rising further by over ten cents. Prices of other goods are showing a weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market    Local imported sugar decreases rather than increases</h3>
<p>A total of 105,143 bags. In addition, there are still 3,200 bags of miscellaneous sugar in the Swire godown.</p>
<h3>Metals    Transactions in No. 2 white lead sheets suddenly surge</h3>
<p>Since the No. 5 and No. 6 white lead sheets were sought after by battery factories, the market price has risen to over thirty-five yuan per *dan* due to limited supply. However, buyers are still active. Recently, No. 2 white lead sheets have also seen increased activity following the No. 5 and No. 6 grades. Tea merchants, cigarette factories, and armories are all increasing purchases. Unfortunately, the supply of circulating goods in the market is also feeling the shortage, and prices are trending upward. The quoted price per *dan* has reached thirty-one yuan, up by one yuan compared to before. Other grades remain stagnant due to inactive actual transactions, and the market situation remains largely unchanged.</p>

<h3>Superstitions About Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Story XIV—</p>
<p>In "Medical Story XII," I mentioned that obstetrics is one of the later-developed branches of medicine. If you don't believe me, please see the following legends and stories about various superstitions regarding childbirth.</p>
<p>We know that the sex of the future child is determined by chromosomes, but before this theory was invented, people often used various superstitious methods to guess the sex of the child in the pregnant woman's womb. In 16th-century Germany, it was customary to soak wheat and barley together in the pregnant woman's urine and then sow them at the same time. If the wheat sprouted first, the future child would be a boy; if the barley sprouted first, it would be a girl. In southwestern France, pregnant women often tossed a silver coin over their shoulders; if the coin landed heads up, a son was expected. Also, a drop of milk or blood was squeezed from the pregnant woman's right breast and dripped into a glass of clear water, and whether it sank or swirled was used to determine the sex of the child.</p>
<p>Goose dung, fragments of deer antlers, and shavings of ivory were all remedies for infertility. In Rome, during the annual festival banquet, monks whipped each other; if an infertile woman reached out and was struck by the whip, it meant that she would soon conceive.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman's cravings should be satisfied - this is also a superstition. Jack Ruff's book contains a story that can serve as evidence for this legend. The story goes like this:</p>
<p>A pregnant woman walked past a bakery and saw a baker standing in front of the oven with his upper body naked. She suddenly felt an irresistible desire to bite a piece of meat from the baker's shoulder. Knowing that this was impossible, she had to linger in front of the bakery for several days, eating nothing else and feeling very depressed. Her husband found out about this and tried every means to persuade her to eat, but to no avail. She said that unless she bit a piece of meat from the baker's shoulder, she would not eat anything else. So the husband went to the baker, gave him a sum of money, and asked him to let her take two bites. However, when she took the third bite, the baker couldn't bear the pain and recoiled. Later, the woman gave birth to three children, two alive and one dead.</p>
<p>There are many stories about maternal impressions. In Ireland, if a baby has a birthmark, can it be rubbed off with a piece of placenta? In France, a pregnant woman cannot be a godmother, otherwise her child will become deaf and mute.</p>
<p>In Spain, when labor pains begin for a woman, if she slips on her husband's trousers, a difficult delivery can be avoided. If labor is slow, the midwife takes a hot iron plate and presses it against the woman's abdomen, hitting the iron plate with her fist. A better method is to rub the woman's abdomen with dried pigeon droppings.</p>
<p>In many places, after childbirth is complete, the woman immediately gets up to take care of the housework, while the husband goes to bed and rests for a few days, sometimes even for several weeks. This custom is called Couvade—meaning "the man takes the woman's rest."</p>
<p>Even in today's enlightened society, there are countless superstitions about childbirth. For example: for morning sickness in pregnant women, corn is an effective remedy; if a menstruating woman touches a pregnant mare, the mare will miscarry; a menstruating woman cannot handle milk, otherwise the milk will immediately turn sour; she cannot make jam, otherwise the jam will immediately harden: if a mother suffers from indigestion during pregnancy, the baby will definitely have a lot of hair: if the husband goes to bed with his shoes on on the wedding night, the first child will definitely be a boy; if a pregnant woman eats a lot of fallen fruit, the child will mostly be a girl: if a pregnant woman makes it a habit to touch her cheeks, the child born will have birthmarks on the face; after childbirth, putting an axe under the bed will stop the bleeding; when a woman takes her first step down the stairs after childbirth, she should retreat backwards; if a baby has convulsions, salt can be placed in his palm; in the first year of a baby's life, fingernails and toenails should not be cut, otherwise he will become a thief.</p>
<p>These stories not only make us feel interested but also make us understand why obstetrics has been so slow to develop.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(76) Cholelithiasis</p>
<p>Q: What is cholelithiasis?</p>
<p>A: It is a disease in which stones develop in the gallbladder, and occasionally in the liver and bile ducts.</p>
<p>Q: What is the composition of these stones?</p>
<p>A: The composition of gallstones is mostly made of cholesterol and bilirubin calcium.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a fixed size for gallstones?</p>
<p>A: The size varies. The smallest can be powdery, some are the size of a needle tip, up to the size of a pea; the largest can be the size of a chicken egg.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a fixed number of gallstones that form?</p>
<p>A: Also not fixed, as few as one, as many as hundreds.</p>
<p>Q: What is the shape of gallstones?</p>
<p>A: The shape varies with the location and number of occurrences. When there is only one stone in the gallbladder, it is spherical or oval. When there are many stones, they become polygonal. The surface is rough; but if the side facing another stone is flat and smooth. Those in the bile ducts are tree-like.</p>
<p>Q: What is the color of gallstones?</p>
<p>A: Not fixed. It varies according to the content of bile pigment. Those composed of cholesterol are almost white; those made of bilirubin calcium are brown. The most common are mixed compositions, which are golden yellow-green or reddish dark brown.</p>
<p>Q: What is the hardness and specific gravity?</p>
<p>A: The hardness also varies according to the chemical composition. Those containing more lime are hard and solid; those containing fresh cholesterol are softer and can be flattened with two fingers. The specific gravity is lighter than water, so they can float on the surface of the water.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Q: Is the occurrence of cholelithiasis related to age and gender?</p>
<p>A: It is more common in people over forty years old, and more common in women.</p>
<p>Q: Is it related to physical condition?</p>
<p>A: Very related. People with gout, diabetes, obesity, arteriosclerosis, rheumatism, hunger, or excessive consumption of fatty foods and meat, and drinking alcohol are more likely to develop gallstones.</p>
<p>Q: What are the causes of gallstones?</p>
<p>A: Anything that can cause bile stasis is a cause of gallstones. Such as anal stricture, parasites, tumors, foreign bodies, swelling of bile duct lymph nodes, cirrhosis and cholangitis, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What neighboring organs and daily life issues affect the occurrence of cholelithiasis?</p>
<p>A: Impaired respiratory movement of the diaphragm and compression of the bile ducts, abdominal constriction, pregnancy, habitual sitting or prolonged bed rest, etc., can all be causes of cholelithiasis.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(73) Foreign Body in the Throat</p>
<p>Foreign bodies in the throat mostly enter through the oral cavity. Foreign bodies often enter when food is accidentally swallowed. Foreign bodies in the pharynx mostly lodge in the palatine tonsils, lingual tonsils, glossoepiglottic fossa, and pyriform sinus. Sometimes they can be trapped at the entrance of the esophagus. As for the types of foreign bodies, fish bones are the most common. Followed by fruit pits, toy pieces, bamboo pieces, metal pieces, coins, needles, and nails. Fish bones, fruit pits, and bamboo pieces become foreign bodies in the pharynx mostly due to carelessness in eating and drinking. Toy pieces, metal pieces, and coins are mostly due to children putting them in their mouths while playing, leading to accidental entry into the pharynx. The main symptom is that the patient complains of a foreign body sensation in the throat and severe pain when swallowing. Often, the foreign body can be expelled naturally, but the wound can still cause irritating pain. Therefore, it often causes the patient to worry that the foreign body has not been completely removed. Sometimes swelling occurs at the injured site. This swelling can often hinder the removal of the foreign body. The wound caused by a foreign body in the pharynx can often lead to secondary wound infections. At this time, the patient feels severe pain when swallowing, tenderness, fever, swelling, and redness. Swelling sometimes extends to the outer neck. Or it may even develop into an abscess. The most appropriate treatment for a foreign body in the pharynx is to have a doctor determine the location of the foreign body and then remove it with forceps or tweezers under the illumination of a laryngoscope. If there is a secondary wound infection, the treatment is more difficult and often dangerous.</p>
<p>If a foreign body enters the larynx, it can usually be coughed out naturally due to a reflexive cough. This is a unique function of the larynx to defend against foreign bodies. So when we eat, if a grain of rice accidentally enters the throat, a cough will start immediately. The cough will only stop when the rice grain is coughed out. This is a very clear demonstration of this fact. However, if the foreign body is large or sharp, it can become embedded in the larynx and cause severe difficulty in breathing. Small foreign bodies can often pass through the glottis and reach the trachea or tracheal branches, leading to pneumonia symptoms and considerable difficulty in breathing. The most accurate diagnosis of a foreign body in the larynx is to use X-ray fluoroscopy. If the difficulty in breathing is obvious, a tracheotomy should be performed first to save breathing. Then find a way to remove the foreign body.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers about Teeth (13)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 71) What are the symptoms of pulp hyperemia?</p>
<p>(Answer) Pulp hyperemia can be said to be the early stage of pulpitis, but it has not yet reached the point of real inflammation. It feels sore and painful when exposed to cold and heat. If treated early, it can be cured and the pulp can be preserved.</p>
<p>(Question 72) What are the symptoms of pulpitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Pulp hyperemia, if left untreated, gradually turns into pulpitis. All stimuli can cause severe pain. The pain lasts for a long time. It will also hurt even when there is no stimulus. Sometimes the pain can radiate to various parts around the teeth. Once the pulp reaches the point of inflammation, it is quite difficult to preserve it. It mostly tends to necrosis.</p>
<p>(Question 73) What are the dangers of leaving necrotic pulp in the pulp chamber?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the pulp that has become inflamed and necrotic is left behind, it is very easy to suppurate. Sometimes it suppurates immediately. Sometimes it takes a long time to suppurate. When the gangrene suppurates, it produces a foul odor. If it is in a closed pulp chamber or one with a very small opening, it will cause abnormal distending pain, and it will not stop until the pus and foul odor are released. At this time, the pus is very likely to penetrate the apical foramen. The periodontal membrane is infected and becomes suppurative periodontitis. An abscess develops at the apex of the tooth root. It destroys local tissue, affects overall health, and becomes a worrisome focus of infection. The harm caused by tooth decay is extreme at this point. I will discuss infectious periodontitis in detail in the next section. Ordinary patients, when suffering from severe pain from pulpitis, rush to seek medical treatment. When the pulp becomes necrotic and the pain stops, they think the disease has disappeared, and they no longer care, allowing the root of the trouble to lie dormant until it becomes a severe disaster in the future.</p>
<p>Section 2 Periodontitis</p>
<p>(Question 74) What is periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is the thin membrane surrounding the root of the tooth, as mentioned in Question 52 above, that becomes congested, inflamed, and even suppurated due to infection or irritation. The toothache that we fear the most is almost all caused by periodontitis and the pulp diseases discussed in the previous section.</p>
<p>(Question 75) How many types of periodontitis can be roughly divided?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be roughly divided into two categories according to its cause: infectious (i.e., suppurative) and non-infectious. The symptoms of infectious periodontitis are more severe, and treatment is more difficult.</p>
<p>(Question 76) What are the causes of infectious periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Infectious periodontitis is mostly caused by pulp diseases caused by tooth decay as discussed in the previous section. After the pulp becomes necrotic and suppurates, the pus passes out of the apex of the tooth root, so that the periodontal membrane is infected, inflamed, and suppurated, and gradually destroyed. The surrounding alveolar bone is also mostly destroyed and suppurated, becoming an alveolar abscess. Initially, the destruction is mostly limited to the tissues around the apex of the tooth root.</p>
<p>(Question 77) What are the causes of non-infectious periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is mostly caused by the following reasons: drug irritation, such as the irritation of arsenic acid and carbolic acid used in local treatment, poisoning from internal medicines such as mercury, lead, and potassium. Instrument irritation, such as the irritation of hard dental stones and food debris, and the irritation of the installed dentures and root canal filling materials. This type of periodontitis often occurs during root canal treatment or after root canal filling. Because it is not due to microbial infection, it is called non-infectious. But after it occurs, it is often easily infected with bacteria and becomes suppurative, turning into infectious periodontitis.</p>
<p>(Question 78) What are the symptoms of all types of periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The periodontal membrane is congested and thickened. The local gingiva turns deep red. The affected tooth feels high, loose, and distended, and it hurts when lightly tapped or touched, making chewing difficult. This is unique to periodontitis (whether infectious or non-infectious) and is not seen in other conditions.</p>
<p>(Question 79) How is the pain of periodontitis distinguished from that of pulpitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The pain of pulpitis is radiating, and the patient often cannot point out the affected tooth. Periodontitis is localized, and the pain is limited to the affected area. Moreover, the periodontal membrane is rich in tactile sensation, and the affected tooth can be detected with a slight tap or pressure.</p>
<p>(Question 80) What is the most obvious symptom of infectious periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Infectious periodontitis has acute and chronic types. The symptoms of the acute type are rapid increase in swelling and pain. After one or two days, the gingiva in the affected area becomes high, pus accumulates and expands, causing throbbing pain. The affected tooth is extremely high and loose, and it hurts intolerably to the touch, so one dare not bite. The pain is also aggravated by hot food. The patient feels generally unwell, cannot sleep or eat well, and often has a slight fever.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (7) (8)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The method of using gold preparations is very similar to that of Tuberculin: initially, extremely small doses are used, then gradually increased, eventually reaching dozens of times the initial dose (compared to the first dose). However, the way patients adapt to metal agents varies from person to person. Moreover, metal agents often cause local and systemic reactions. If the reaction is too severe, it will undoubtedly harm the condition itself! Therefore, before and after each injection, careful attention should be paid to the patient's general condition, temperature, pulse, appetite, the speed of blood sedimentation, detailed urine and stool examinations, the presence or absence of rashes, and the occurrence or absence of diarrhea... The decision to increase the dosage for each injection must be based on a thorough understanding of the patient's condition after the previous injection; it should never be inflexible. Therefore, doctors should exercise great caution and care when administering this treatment to avoid regrets.</p>
<p>It might be useful to discuss the scope of application for metal agents. Their effectiveness against laryngeal tuberculosis has already been mentioned. Regarding pulmonary tuberculosis, initially it was limited to chronic forms, but now it is known to be effective for exudative forms as well, including those that are progressive (but not too severe) and accompanied by elevated temperature. In such cases, it can sometimes compensate for what Tuberculin cannot, and it can be used concurrently with surgical treatments without conflict. Its effectiveness against lupus vulgaris in skin tuberculosis is undeniable. However, it is contraindicated for intestinal tuberculosis, kidney tuberculosis, and complications arising from these two!</p>
<p>Furthermore, before the widespread use of gold preparations, some people strongly advocated copper preparations, but they are now rarely used clinically! Recently, some people have advocated the use of preparations, but they are still in the experimental stage and have not yet been adopted clinically.</p>
<p>(B) Cinnamic Acid. It was once used as a common stimulant therapy in the past, but now it is rarely mentioned. However, the use of Erbon tablets (cinnamic acid preparations) for high fever is common in clinical practice.</p>
<p>(C) Silicates. The use of silicic acid for pulmonary tuberculosis has long been well known among the people in Europe, but its formal adoption in clinical practice is a recent development. Their rationale is based on the fact that connective tissue in human and animal bodies contains silicic acid as an important component. The cessation of progression in pulmonary tuberculosis lesions is entirely due to the surrounding connective tissue formation, which is particularly rich in silicic acid. Therefore, the application of silicates is obviously appropriate for stopping the progression of lesions and promoting scarring! It has no contraindications for any form of the disease, and it can be used safely even when other treatments are being administered. Silicates also often produce good results for general symptoms of the disease, such as cough, poor appetite, and elevated temperature!</p>
<p>(D) Calcium Salts. This is the most common and widely used treatment among most doctors, so common as to be the subject of the phrase "no illness without pulmonary consumption, no consumption without calcium!" What is the underlying scientific basis for this? We know that if the lesions of this disease show calcareous hardening, it is a very encouraging sign, because it is entirely through this that it gradually heals: even in old tuberculous lesions, there are calcareous remnants present: workers who regularly breathe limestone and gypsum powder are also less likely to contract tuberculosis. All of this is enough to prove that the relationship between lime and this disease is extraordinary. Lime is a combination of calcium, so calcium salts have become an indispensable agent in the treatment of this disease! This is the most important goal. In addition, calcium preparations have hemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-exudative effects; calcium is also the basic substance of important cells in the human body, so its scope of application in clinical practice is very broad.</p>
<p>There are also many calcium preparations, as numerous as bamboo shoots after rain; the most common is a combination of glucose and calcium, which is introduced into the human body through intravenous injection. Because glucose solutions have nourishing, diuretic, and detoxifying effects, they are even more adaptable to the treatment of this disease. It generally has no contraindications for any form of the disease. In addition to promoting calcification of the lesions themselves, it also has excellent results for general symptoms of the disease, such as high fever, loss of appetite, and coughing up blood.</p>
<p>(E) Wood Tar. This drug has long been praised by word of mouth. When it was first used for this disease, it was generally regarded as a specific drug; this is certainly not correct. However, its effectiveness in promoting appetite and resolving phlegm is undeniable. However, its taste is very unpleasant, and it is not suitable for patients with unhealthy gastrointestinal systems or those with a tendency to cough up blood. It also has some stimulating effects on the kidneys, so urine and stool examinations should not be neglected. There are also countless preparations in this category. A certain factory's product containing guaiac potas, which was very popular a few years ago, is now rarely introduced or praised! In fact, wood tar pills have the same effect, so why waste countless amounts of money!</p>

<p>Telegraph Special Edition</p>
<h3>This Publication Over the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Time flies, and the year draws to a close. The twenty-fourth year of the Republic will end within these next ten days or so. What is the state of the telegraph business after a year of reorganization? What is the degree of progress? It is necessary to examine these questions to encourage further efforts. This has already been reported in another article and will not be repeated here. This publication has been in circulation for two years since its first issue in December of the twenty-second year of the Republic. What has this publication done to introduce the telegraph business during these two years? What contributions has it made to the general public? These are questions that deserve our discussion.</p>
<p>The purpose of this publication is "telegraph openness." This idea was clearly stated in the first issue and has been upheld ever since. Telegraph is a powerful tool for public communication. If it is not shared with the public to gain their sympathy and support, even with huge assets and a large number of talents, there will be little development in the future. Why? Because closing the door to build a car that fits the ruts, where supply and demand are mismatched, is against economic principles. Therefore, on the one hand, the government should enrich and improve the business itself to meet the needs of society, and on the other hand, it should disclose the actual situation of the business as much as possible to gain public approval. Private businesses still rely on attracting customers, how much more so national businesses?</p>
<p>The main purpose of this publication is openness. However, the essence of openness lies in honesty. If it is not honest, what is the value of openness? Over the past two years, colleagues have been cautious in this regard. All telegraph news is based on facts, and explorations and clarifications are added before publication. If the news is not accurate, it will not be adopted, no matter how novel and moving it may be. Conversely, news of future facts, such as three-year plans and five-year plans, will not be published even if accurate. The purpose of this publication is "to disclose facts," not to "disclose words." It is believed that governance is not about talking much, and facts speak louder than words.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, has the content of the telegraph business been enriched? Has the business itself been improved? We dare not answer in the affirmative with complacency. But what about the situation two years ago compared to today? What is the public's impression now compared to two years ago? The public will judge for themselves, and there is no need for us to explain it in detail. However, what we are comforted by is that this publication borrows a corner of the Shanghai Shen Bao as a park. Wherever the Shen Bao reaches, this publication spreads with it. Therefore, the communication range of this publication is constantly expanding: as of the first anniversary, the company received a total of 837 letters from various locations. As of today, it has exceeded 2,000 letters. The circulation of the Shen Bao, as of the first anniversary, was 100,000 copies. As of today, it has exceeded 150,000 copies. Therefore, the wider the circulation of the Shen Bao, the more opportunities this publication has to introduce itself, and the deeper the public's sympathy becomes.</p>
<p>The aforementioned public sympathy cannot be obtained overnight. There must be real and reliable facts and an open and honest attitude. The internal situation of the telegraph business must be revealed completely so that the public can understand the achievements of the past, the current situation, and the future trends, and understand the policy direction of the telegraph authorities. At the same time, they should understand the function of the telegraph business, arouse their interest in using the telegraph, and contribute their opinions and abilities for the government to adopt and use. Therefore, the mission of this publication is to convey government policies to the public on the one hand, and to present public opinions to the government on the other hand. On the other hand, it adjusts the opinions of the government and the public from the perspective of this publication, and promotes progress. However, the main condition for the above work lies in the cooperation of all parties. Over the past two years, this publication has been deeply honored by the concern of the public. It is hoped that we will be enlightened at any time in the future, so that the telegraph business will develop day by day. This is also the humble intention of the colleagues.</p>
<p>Recalling the first anniversary last year, this publication was published as a supplement to the Shen Bao, which was inconvenient to preserve. Readers requested that it be compiled into a single volume for reference. To answer the elegant wishes of the supplement, we selected and classified the texts from the first to the twenty-fifth issues and printed "Telegraph Special Edition First Collection," which sold out in less than a month. Afterwards, we received many letters from readers requesting the compilation of the second collection. We now plan to compile the texts from the twenty-sixth to the fiftieth issues in the same way for commemoration. The publication date will be announced later.</p>
<h3>Various Adjustments to the Relationship Between Telegraph and the Public Over the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The relationship between the telegraph business and the public in European and American countries is extremely close. Whenever there are new facilities, they must first use novel advertisements to widely publicize them, so that every household knows about them. Then they solicit public criticism to collect the benefits of extensive opinions. The development of public enterprise has its origins. The telegraph business in our country has been established for more than fifty years. The business situation has not yet flourished. Although there are many reasons for this, the lack of a necessary connection between the telegraph business and the public is also a major reason. In recent years, the transportation authorities have been aware of this, and have devoted their energy to adjusting the relationship with the public. Over the past two years, the various facilities for this matter are worth mentioning. A brief summary is presented below to share with the people of the country:</p>
<p>1.  Publication of Telegraph Publications. Telegraph facilities are constantly being improved, and laws and regulations are often promulgated. In order to make these new rules and facilities known to the public and facilitate their use, it is necessary to use publications as a medium. Therefore, the first publication was this publication. This was followed by the "Telegraph Special Edition" of the Tianjin Dagong Bao, the "Telegraph Bi-Weekly" of the Qingdao Min Bao, and the "Telegraph" of the Yantai Donghai Daily. These newspapers are all major newspapers in their respective regions, and the Shen Bao and Dagong Bao are especially known as the leaders of the newspaper industry. Their propaganda power is extraordinary, and there is no doubt that they contribute to the improvement of public telegraph knowledge.</p>
<p>2.  Establishment of Business Inspectors. Telegraph business is quite complicated, and senders, receivers, and telephone users often have points that are not clear. If they are not explained in detail, various misunderstandings often arise. Moreover, defects in the business and errors in procedures are often unavoidable on the part of the telegraph office. If there is no opportunity to communicate them, one party will only feel disappointed, and the other party will still have no hope of improvement. The Ministry of Communications was aware of this and specially set up business inspectors in each bureau to be responsible for inspecting telegram and telephone business. They personally visit various firms, institutions, organizations, newspaper offices, and news agencies every day to inquire about or promote various telegram and telephone matters. The public has the opportunity to inquire about matters related to the telegraph business that they do not understand, and they can receive a satisfactory answer if they have any dissatisfaction. In this way, the credibility of the telegraph office is enhanced, and public opinion is communicated, which is truly a mutually beneficial way.</p>
<p>3.  Broadcasting of Telegraph Knowledge. In addition to the above two items, the Ministry of Communications also promulgated the "Measures for Broadcasting Telegraph Knowledge Propaganda." All telegraph bureaus and telephone bureaus in places where local radio stations have been established must handle this matter. The purpose is to instill public knowledge of communication. The content includes the following items: Clarification of the regulations of various telegram and telephone businesses, as well as their prices. Explanation of cost-effective or money-saving methods. Reports on various new facilities that facilitate communication and newly added bureaus. Explanations of the benefits of using , and advice on registering radios, as well as answering questions that the public often asks the telegraph bureau. All of these efforts are exerted by the provincial broadcasting stations to achieve the effect of propaganda. Those who have radios installed can gain the opportunity to acquire telegraph knowledge while enjoying entertainment programs.</p>
<p>4.  Production and Screening of Telegraph Films and Slides. In order to enable the public to understand the truth about telegraph and telephone communications, the Ministry of Communications entrusted the Central Propaganda Committee to go to various telegraph agencies in Shanghai to produce a telegraph education film, which captured the machinery and work of radio and telephone, etc., one by one. In addition, a sound explanation was added to explain the principles and procedures of various telegraph machines so that the audience could gain the concept of electrical communication within a few tens of minutes. It has now been completed and will be released to the public soon. In addition, many beautiful and eye-catching slides with simple words have been produced and shown in local cinemas to promote various emerging businesses.</p>
<p>The above points are the major ones. Other important measures include compiling and publishing telegraph news, publishing business advertisements, distributing promotional brochures, setting up telephone information to facilitate the public, and opening telegraph agencies to the public for visits. These are all important plans to adjust public relations, and they are being implemented with attention by the transportation authorities. However, what has been described is only the beginning of a close connection between the telegraph business and the people. To promote and develop it requires efforts in the future!</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Telegraph Bureau in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>In the past year, in order to develop the telegraph business, the telegraph authorities have made major reforms to the organization of the Telegraph Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completion of the Merger of Telegraph Bureaus and Stations: After the Ministry of Communications merged the telegraph bureaus and radio stations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou between May and October last year, they were uniformly called Telegraph Bureaus, and the organizational system was stipulated. Under the director, there was a chief engineer who presided over wireless radio technology matters. Under him, there were four departments: Reporting, Business, Engineering, and Administration, with detailed regulations on their respective responsibilities so that each department would be responsible for its own affairs. The implementation was effective! The subsequent mergers included 18 locations: Xiamen, Fuzhou, Qingdao, Ba County, Chengdu, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Zheng County, Yichang, Nanchang, Wan County, Guiyang, Chang'an, Changsha, Yantai, Gui Sui, Lanzhou, and Ningxia, all of which were implemented from April 1st of this year. Except for the five bureaus in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Qingdao, and Ba County, whose organization was roughly similar to that of Nanjing, the scale of the other bureaus was relatively reduced. Only one engineer was set up under the director to preside over technical matters, and one business manager was set up to preside over reporting and business matters. Since the merger of telegraph bureaus and stations across the country began in May of last year, it has only been over a year, and all mergers have been completed. From then on, both wireless and radio are under the same organization, and the organizational system is more sound and reasonable than before. Not only can wireless radio communication and transmission be used to increase speed, but also in terms of management, it can centralize authority and facilitate command.</p>
<p>Abolition of the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office: The Ministry of Communications has set up long-distance telephones in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei, and established a Long-Distance Telephone Management Office to manage them. All reporting and business offices, agencies, and long-distance telephone business offices attached to telegraph bureaus within each province are managed by the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office, including matters such as scheduling telephone lines, installing machinery, setting prices, assessing personnel, auditing accounts, and issuing telephone bill receipts. Therefore, telegraph bureaus, reporting and business offices, and agencies within each province are not under the same management organization and must be managed by both the Telegraph Administration Bureau and the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office. This makes it difficult to centralize authority and makes command inconvenient. The Ministry of Communications has now ordered its abolition, and all long-distance telephone affairs have been transferred to the Telegraph Administration Bureau. From then on, the Telegraph Administration Bureaus can uniformly direct and supervise the telegraph bureaus, reporting and business offices, agencies, and long-distance telephone business offices within their jurisdiction, so as to achieve the effect of finger and arm.</p>
<p>Abolition of the Trunk Telegraph Line Engineering Office: The survey, construction, maintenance, improvement, expansion, and distribution of materials and funds for important trunk telegraph lines and long-distance telephone lines in various places were previously managed by the Trunk Telegraph Line Engineering Office (such as the former Shanghai-Hankou Engineering Office, etc.). However, there are also engineering departments in the local Telegraph Administration Bureaus that are responsible for the above-mentioned matters of the telegraph lines and long-distance telephone lines in their respective districts. Often, the telegraph lines or long-distance telephone lines within the same province are divided into trunk lines and branch lines, which makes it difficult to unify authority and affects the project. At the Telegraph Conference held by the Ministry of Communications last year, a resolution was made to abolish the Trunk Telegraph Line Engineering Office, and it has now been ordered to be implemented. All matters related to the maintenance of telegraph lines and long-distance telephone lines are uniformly merged into the Telegraph Administration Bureau for management.</p>
<p>Implementation of Reporting and Telephone Merger: Telegraph and telephone are important tools for public communication, and they both belong to state-owned enterprises, so it is necessary to integrate them. Most major cities and towns in our country that have telephone bureaus have also set up telegraph bureaus. In order to facilitate management, the Ministry of Communications has merged the telegraph bureaus and telephone bureaus in 22 locations, including Wu County, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Jiangdu, Qingyuan, Jiujiang, Bengbu, Shashi, Zheng County, Luoyang, Weihaiwei, Yuci, Nanchang, Anyang, Longkou, Yichang, Tongguan, Dongtai, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Tongshan, and Guiyang, and renamed them Telegraph Bureaus. Their task is to operate both telegraph and telephone businesses. The remaining telephone bureaus in the capital, Tianjin, Wuhan, Beiping, Qingdao, and Yantai are large in scale and difficult to merge for the time being. It is also heard that the telegraph bureaus in Chang'an (i.e., Xi'an), Xinpu, Guanyun, and Datong will also add local telephones to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned important reforms, other efforts to enrich the authority of the local Telegraph Administration Bureaus have also been promoted. Recently, it was ordered that if each telegraph bureau has matters to request funds or instructions, they should first be submitted to the competent Telegraph Administration Bureau for verification and transfer, and should not be submitted directly to the Ministry of Communications, so that each Telegraph Administration Bureau can implement management authority. This order is nothing more than increasing administrative efficiency and unifying command. It is indeed an important facility in the organization.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's New Year</h3>
<h3>Telegraph Business of the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Last year on December 1st, the reporter drafted an article for this publication titled "Telegraph Business of the Past Year," briefly outlining the improvements in telegraph services over the past year for the reference of the public. Time flies, and the end of the year is approaching again. What has been the progress of telegraph services in the past year? This is something that informed individuals are eager to understand. Therefore, following the previous example, I will again describe the improvements in telegraph services this year to fulfill the purpose of this publication.</p>
<p>1.  Improvement of Telegraph Equipment</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." The completeness of telegraph equipment greatly affects the efficiency of communication. The improvements in mechanical equipment this year include changing the keyboard perforators to a large and small striking type and modifying the Creed printer to be suitable for Chinese four-code small-character telegrams. These are valuable inventions for increasing the speed of telegrams. The reporter has described their principles and functions in this publication, and they are recent contributions to the telegraph industry's honor in improving machinery. Furthermore, after the national bureau implemented a merger this year, the connection with wireless telegraph services became closer. Major bustling bureau reporting rooms have also added equipment such as air tubes for transporting telegram drafts and pulling devices to replace manual labor with mechanical means as much as possible in the telegram delivery process. Other bureaus with heavy telegram traffic have gradually adopted the Wheatstone automatic receiver to reduce delays and have added distribution condensers to increase speed. These are all significant improvements in telegraph equipment.</p>
<p>2.  Dispatch and Expansion of Circuits</p>
<p>Since the merger of wired and wireless telegraphs, the Ministry of Communications, in order to develop the efficiency of cooperation between the two, specially formulated a schedule for national wireless telegraph conferences to reduce redundant wired and wireless circuits and increase the meeting time for long-distance communication, so as to fully develop the function of wireless telegraph communication. At the same time, for official public telegrams and telegrams with several receiving place names listed, the Ministry also stipulated communication routes and distributed them to various bureaus to avoid duplication of wired and wireless transmission. As for wired telegraphs this year, the following important circuits were added:</p>
<p>*   Ba County to Chengdu Direct Line The line between Ba County and Chengdu previously had only one single line, which was so dilapidated that it was unusable. After being reorganized by the Ministry of Communications, it was changed to a high-speed machine for communication on May 16th, but the capacity was too small. Therefore, the Ministry specially added a telegraph line to the Ba-Rong (Chengdu) telephone pole line and opened duplex communication on September 6th.</p>
<p>*   Ba County to Guiyang Direct Line The direct line between Gan (Chongqing) and Guiyang was previously only available through wireless telegraph. Later, due to the needs of telegram services in the area, a line was built and communication was established in June of this year.</p>
<p>*   Guiyang to Changsha Direct Line The direct line between Xiang (Hunan) and Qian (Guizhou) via wired telegraph is also one of the great constructions of this year. Because the route is too long, a booster station was installed in Hongjiang Bureau, and it officially began communication on May 22nd.</p>
<p>*   Guiyang to Kunming Direct Line The success of the direct line between Qian (Guizhou) and Dian (Yunnan) via wired telegraph is an innovation in the history of telegraph administration. Between Guiyang and Kunming, not only is the distance long and the project huge, but the mountain roads are rugged, making it difficult to set up the line. However, thanks to the leadership of the authorities and the efforts of all parties, communication was officially established on November 16th.</p>
<p>*   Lanzhou to Hami Direct Line Both Lanzhou and Hami are prosperous areas in the Northwest. Telegrams to and from these areas were previously relayed through Jiuquan, which was very slow. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications specially set up a booster station in Jiuquan Bureau, and the direct line between Hami and Lanzhou officially opened on June 18th. In the future, telegrams sent to Xinjiang Province will be even faster.</p>
<p>3.  Compiling and Printing a Directory of Telegraph Bureaus The current directory of telegraph bureaus was published in 1931, and it is outdated and unsuitable. In recent years, many telegraph bureaus, telegraph and telephone business offices, agencies, and wireless stations have been added, and the names of places have also changed, making it necessary to continue to revise the directory to meet the needs. It is scheduled to be published and distributed in the early part of this month.</p>
<p>4.  Compiling and Establishing Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations The Ministry of Communications has promulgated many laws and regulations regarding the receiving and sending of domestic telegrams. Since the implementation of the new regulations on telegraph fees, it has become even more complicated, making it difficult for both senders and receivers to understand and even for telegraph bureau staff to remember. In order to adjust the relationship between the public and the telegraph bureau and to integrate various receiving and sending regulations into one, the Ministry of Communications will compile and implement a set of domestic telegraph business regulations. From now on, the relationship between senders and receivers and the telegraph bureau will have a clear standard to follow, which should reduce various unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>5.  Revising, Republishing and Distributing the New Edition of the Clear and Secret Codebook The new edition of the clear and secret codebook published by the Ministry of Communications in August 1933 sold very quickly. Therefore, this year, the content was greatly refreshed and republished. In addition to retaining all the previous improvements, the new edition also includes a chronological table of major events in telegraph administration and a description of the current situation of telegraph administration for reference by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>6.  Drawing and Printing Telegraph Line Maps In recent years, the dispatch and addition of telegraph lines has been frequent. In order to enable various telegraph bureaus to understand the layout of telegraph lines, the Ministry of Communications specially drew telegraph line maps in February of this year and distributed them to various bureaus for use. It is said that the allocation of telegraph lines in various provinces has changed a lot recently, and a new edition will be reprinted to meet the needs.</p>
<p>The above are just brief descriptions of the general situation based on what the reporter knows. They cannot cover all the telegraph business of the Ministry of Communications this year, but they can give a glimpse of the progress of telegraph business in China.</p>
<h3>Telephone Business of the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>The telephone business run by the Ministry of Communications has made great progress in recent years. In the 26th issue of this publication, the author wrote "Telephone Business of the Past Year," briefly elaborating on the achievements of telephone business reform last year for the reference of the public. Time flies, and another year has passed. In this year, what are the points of telephone business that are convenient for the public? What are the points of business consolidation? Reviewing the past and anticipating the future, the main points are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Convenience for the Public</p>
<p>Regulations on Telephone Bureaus in Tianjin and Shanghai Allowing Users to Transmit Telegrams via Telephone In order to promote the connection and utilization of telegraph and telephone services and to provide the public with greater communication convenience, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated a method for telephone bureau users to transmit telegrams via telephone and ordered the telegraph bureaus in Tianjin and Shanghai to implement it on a trial basis from March of this year. According to this method, the telegraph bureau installs two telephones specifically for receiving telegrams sent by telephone users. Telephone users who wish to send telegrams do not need to prepay telegraph fees or register with the bureau. They can dial the designated telephone number of the telegraph bureau to transmit the telegram. The required telegraph fees are totaled and settled at the end of the month, and the telephone bureau collects them from the users on behalf of the telegraph bureau.</p>
<p>Abolition of Long-Distance Telephone Deposits in Beijing and Shanghai Previously, telephone users in the city who wished to connect to long-distance telephones on their private telephones had to prepay a deposit as a guarantee for long-distance call charges. This method meant that users who had not paid the deposit could not fully enjoy the convenience of connecting local calls with long-distance calls. In order to improve this situation, the deposit requirement has been abolished in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Trial Implementation of Telephone Bureaus Answering Local Affairs Inquiries from Users Each telephone bureau under the Ministry of Communications has a service desk for users to inquire about telephone numbers. In order to facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications has formulated a method for telephone bureaus to answer telephone users' inquiries about various local affairs, expanding the functions of the service desk to include answering inquiries about the following matters: local telephone rental fees and long-distance telephone call locations and prices, domestic and international telegram communication locations and prices, domestic and international mail delivery locations and postage rates, daily business hours of post and telegraph bureaus, standard time, locations of local fires, train and ship schedules and prices, and the day's programs and times for various entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Formulating Simple Rules for Post Offices to Sell Public Telephone Services These simple rules stipulate that post offices in major trading ports that sell telegrams, entrusted by local telegraph bureaus and telephone bureaus, should sell public telephone services, but the scope of sales is limited to outgoing calls. Long-distance calls are limited to ordinary calls, and the sales time is based on the post office's business hours. This is to promote the development of postal and telecommunications services while facilitating the public.</p>
<p>Promoting the Installation of Public Telephones at Train Stations Regarding the installation of public telephones at train stations, the Shanghai Telegraph and Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Administration have separately signed interim measures with the Railway Bureau for the provision of public telephone locations at various stations along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. It is stipulated that along the two railways, all telephone bureaus directly under the Ministry of Communications, telephone bureaus approved by the Ministry of Communications and run by provinces or cities, or telephone companies run by merchants, can negotiate with the Railway Bureau to provide appropriate locations at local stations for the telephone bureau to set up public telephone retail outlets.</p>
<p>Free Cancellation of Long-Distance Calls According to the general rules for long-distance telephone business, if the caller requests cancellation after registering, they must pay one-third of the call fee as a cancellation fee. However, the limit on the waiting time for the caller has not yet been specified. It is now stipulated that if the caller has registered and has waited for four hours for an ordinary call or two hours for a priority call due to busy lines, they can apply for free cancellation.</p>
<p>Reduced Prices for Long-Distance Calls at Night In order to relieve the congestion of long-distance telephone traffic and develop nighttime business, the Ministry of Communications has formulated a method for reducing long-distance telephone prices at night, following the precedents of various countries for charging lower rates for calls during off-peak hours. All long-distance ordinary calls and ordinary priority calls between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. the next day are calculated at 70% of the daytime price. This time is based on the time when both users start talking, not the time when they register.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Business Consolidation</p>
<p>Formulating Telephone Bureau Fee Collection Methods The fee collection methods of various telephone bureaus are inconsistent and often inappropriate. Therefore, a method for telephone bureaus to collect fees from users is formulated, stipulating that each telephone bureau should divide the local area into several regions according to local conditions and specify a fee collection date for each region between the 1st and 10th of each month. At that time, the telephone bureau will send staff to carry receipts and collect fees from each household. If the fees are not paid on time, the telephone bureau will first send a reminder by telephone on the third day after the deadline, and then suspend the call on the fifth day. If the fees are still not paid after another seven days, the number will be canceled and the machine will be removed. All outstanding fees will be deducted from the deposit, and if the deposit is insufficient, the balance will still be collected. Since the implementation of this method, each bureau has been able to collect all the monthly call fees, and all previous outstanding fees have been paid off in part each month.</p>
<p>Promoting Telecommunications Business Inspection Since the implementation of the business inspection method, it has been quite effective. However, this method is only implemented in major trading ports, and the matters inquired about are limited to telegrams, so the scope is not widespread. It is now stipulated that telecommunications business inspectors should also inspect telephone business, and business inspectors from telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places are designated to be responsible for inspecting the business of local telephone bureaus. All matters that inspectors should inspect regarding users and telephone bureau business are specified in detail.</p>
<p>Formulating Regulations on Local Telephone Business The Ministry of Communications and its affiliated telephone bureaus previously had their own business regulations, which were varied and inadequate, and urgently needed to be revised in detail to make them uniform. However, the economic conditions in various places are different, and the mechanical equipment of each bureau is not the same. The unified method should still contain the meaning of flexibility for each bureau. The Ministry of Communications first studied the current regulations of each bureau, formulated business regulations based on the current system of each bureau, taking into account local conditions, and referring to European and American regulations. The new rules were implemented on July 1, 1935.</p>
<p>Promoting the Three-Minute System for Long-Distance Calls The time for each long-distance telephone call varies, with some places using a three-minute system and others using a five-minute system, which is inconvenient. In order to unify the call time for domestic and international calls, it is considered necessary to universally adopt the three-minute system. At the end of last year, the Ministry ordered the long-distance telephone management agencies of various provinces to re-draft the call prices for each region according to the three-minute standard, and each was approved. The new method has been implemented in Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces in April of this year, and in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces in September and October of this year, respectively.</p>
<p>Eliminating Free Telephones in Various Telephone Bureaus It is found that employees of various telephone bureaus often install free telephones, which consume labor and materials, occupy numbers, and hinder business. In addition, if there are unlimited official telephones, it is a loss to the public and should be eliminated to facilitate rectification. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications will review and approve the number of telephones to be approved according to the distribution schedule of official telephones in each bureau, and no additional telephones shall be installed thereafter. All free telephones for employees will be removed. However, those who need to contact official business or direct dispatching may install a half-price telephone in their residence, but they must first obtain approval.</p>
<p>The above are the results of the telephone business consolidation in the past year. The following table lists the number of telephone users in each bureau in June 1934 and June 1935, as well as the number of users in newly established telephone bureaus, to illustrate the general situation.</p>
<h3>Please Cherish the Telephone</h3>
<p>— Broadcast by Tianjin Telephone Bureau</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I am going to talk about the situation where telephone users cherish the telephone. Although the telephone machine is not something that the user provides themselves, and the telephone bureau is responsible for repairing all obstacles, the user should also fulfill the responsibility of cherishing it. This is not just for the telephone bureau's sake; in fact, it is also of great benefit to the user themselves. Because if the machine malfunctions, it will take a considerable amount of time for the telephone bureau to send someone to repair it, and the user will already feel a lot of inconvenience. If the machine is damaged and has to be compensated for, that goes without saying. Here are a few points to pay attention to:</p>
<p>Do not twist the soft cord of the earpiece: Although the surface of the soft cord is woven with yarn, the core is made of thin metal strands. Metallic things are not as flexible as cotton yarn. After being twisted a few times, it is easy to break. If the metal strands are broken, there will be obstacles to speaking, or there will be noise, or it will not be able to make calls at all.</p>
<p>Do not twist the earpiece too hard: After finishing speaking, the earpiece must be hung up to allow the hook to drop; otherwise, the telephone will not be able to receive calls. However, when hanging the earpiece back, do not use too much force or deliberately twist it hard, because this will loosen the earpiece screws. Sometimes, the internal parts are subjected to severe vibration, which will cause the telephone to not work.</p>
<p>Do not push the dial back forcefully when dialing: After the dial is moved, the finger must be removed to allow the dial to return to its original position by itself. The return has a certain speed. If you use your finger to push it back forcefully, the speed will be inaccurate, the number will be easily dialed incorrectly, and the dial will often be damaged as a result.</p>
<p>When dialing, do not use pen stems or other objects. Even when using your own finger, do not press deeply on the dial to avoid scratching it.</p>
<p>Do not take apart the telephone yourself: Although the structure of the telephone is not very complicated, each part's position and distance has a certain standard. People without experience should not take it apart casually. Even if there is an internal obstacle, you should report it to the telephone bureau, and a worker will come to repair it, so as not to cause major problems!</p>
<p>The above are all very simple things. As long as users pay a little attention, they can do it. "Cherishing public property" is originally a virtue of every citizen, and the perfection of the telephone is closely related to the interests of users!</p>
<h3>Conference Calls in New York City</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The New York City Telephone Company's directory contains a new type of telephone service for the use of merchants and people from all walks of life. This service is called "conference service." Busy executives only need to have a telephone in hand to be able to speak with representatives in one room, whether they are at sea, on a ship, or anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>The telephone company divides this service into two categories: executives can issue orders to their subordinates, but the subordinates cannot answer; by adding a little more to the price, the company adds two-way hookups, and everyone on the same circuit can answer each other fluently. There are no other additional fees; only city-to-city telephone charges apply. This service is often used for families scattered in various places, especially on holidays. The number of family members can reach up to nine people.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Situation Next Year</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>This newspaper reported that a certain mathematician and philosopher divined a hexagram for Shanghai. The hexagram is "the hexagram of increasing (益) in the Book of Changes, changing to the hexagram of the family (家人)." According to this hexagram, Shanghai's situation next year will be like a young couple with deep love, and they will have a son. Therefore, it is determined that although the market situation in January and February next year will be slightly sluggish, it will be prosperous from March to August. In particular, small business people will be very successful. However, the hexagram of "the family" implies that people should refrain from extravagance.</p>
<p>The world economic panic has been going on for four or five years, and whether it is East or West, all have been greatly affected. Our country cannot escape this tidal wave, especially Shanghai, the national industrial and commercial center, which is even more strained. The decline of Shanghai's industry and commerce has been evident in the past two years. The banners of "big price cuts" hang in various large and small shops all year round. Banks and money shops often go bankrupt. There is hardly a day without shops announcing liquidation. All these things show that Shanghai's economic situation is deteriorating. The large-scale export of silver has further plunged the once prosperous Shanghai into a near-collapse situation.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that the economies of various countries in the world have shown signs of turning around. A group of predictors, politicians, and economists have predicted that the world economy will soon recover. The words of predictors are unfounded and cannot be trusted. The inferences of politicians and economists are, of course, much more reliable. According to reports from some politicians, the number of unemployed people in various countries is gradually decreasing, and various industries are improving day by day. If this is the case, the economic situation may indeed have the hope of gradually improving.</p>
<p>However, the economic situation in our country is still depressed. Although the government authorities and various industrialists have jointly sought to revive the industry and commerce, they have not yet been able to stabilize the market. In the eyes of the general public, Shanghai has shown a sudden activity and the economic situation seems to be gradually improving since the Ministry of Finance reformed the monetary system. But they do not know that this so-called improvement is just a temporary stimulus. Before the people's purchasing power can be truly increased and the prices of goods can be truly stabilized, it is difficult to be optimistic about Shanghai's economy.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that the world's economy is closely related to each other. Now that the economies of various countries show signs of turning around, there is no reason why Shanghai should not change with them. This is very true. However, we must understand that our country is an industrially and commercially backward country, and its trade is in a state of import surplus. Therefore, restoring economic prosperity is not as easy as it is for others. Therefore, it is feared that Shanghai's situation cannot be reversed in the near future. The prediction of a certain mathematician and philosopher may only be regarded as a kind of prediction. The revival of Shanghai still depends on the efforts of all parties.</p>
<p>However, it is said that a certain mathematician and philosopher became famous in the world for predicting the Manchurian Incident. Recently, when he came to Shanghai from North China, he calculated fortunes for several of our important people, winning the praise of celebrities. In that case, his prediction cannot be taken lightly. Let's all see what Shanghai's situation will be like next year.</p>
<h3>Distant View of Mount Fuji</h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>When I came, it was late autumn, and the face of the island country was just verdant water, beautiful green mountains, full of freshness. After midnight in a cool autumn September, a night train from Kobe to Tokyo, carrying a tired and slightly leaping traveler's heart, drove toward the heart of the island. I endured the loneliness of the cold night on the journey, and the sparse stars outside the car window were faint. I was tired and could not bear it any longer, waiting to sleep in the remaining moonlight of the dawn wind. Suddenly, as if waking from a dream, a gray-white haze covered the sky, and the atmosphere of the early morning was refreshing. Opening my drowsy eyes, the horizon had been stained with a band of red glow, and the green fields were fresh and bright. I opened the window and looked out, and a beautiful sun was swaying up on the distant mountain. But the cries of my companions suddenly came from behind the car:</p>
<p>"Look, Mount Fuji is there..." At this moment, Mount Fuji in the island country showed its face. In my childhood, I had an impression of the words "Fuji volcano," which seemed to me to be strange, extremely high, or full of scorched mountains. But when I first glimpsed it, it was like a white cap, now in the distance. Half-hidden by the nearby mountains, who would say that Mount Fuji is covered with snow all year round, and the snow does not melt? I completely forgot the fatigue of the journey and admired: the morning of the island country, the clear and blue horizon in the distance, the green fields I searched for, the green mountains, the sunlight fell on the beautiful, clean, and unique Mount Fuji peak, which was covered with snow. The look of the white dewdrops rolling on the heart of the leaves in the courtyard in the morning is not as lovely as it is. What is it like? The first time I met, the exquisitely pure Fuji! This is not a volcano, but a snow mountain.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Xiaoruo's Calligraphy from Nantong</h3>
<p>However, the ruthless train carried me forward; finally, Mount Fuji only hastily glanced at and fell behind. Arriving in Tokyo, I had not forgotten the initial acquaintance along the way. I occasionally heard that if you climbed to the grassland of Takadanobaba in the neighborhood, you could see Fuji. So, with a joyful heart, I often climbed up to look around, but there was no trace: I could only make memories in vain.</p>
<p>The autumn was waning, and the wind was strong. It was the season for stepping on fallen leaves on the grassland! Also at the time of the first sunrise, I walked out of the wooden house in the forest, and people suddenly froze. How could Mount Fuji, with its original clean, elegant, snow-white, and free-spirited style, suddenly appear clearly in front of the grassland, as if emerging from the dust! And even more visible at a glance. For a moment, I almost wondered if it had fallen from the sky. It turned out that the beautiful scenery of Fuji was close at hand; but there was a lot of fog and heavy clouds on the island, and it was rare to have such clear weather as in the south: shrouded in smoke, Mount Fuji was obscured. And even if it was the first time I came to Tokyo to see it.</p>
<p>The mountain did not seem far away or high, and the top, bottom, left, and right were all white snow, it was really a snow mountain: but it was far away and close, only slightly seeing thick snow revealing wrinkles, like a beauty's field gauze clothes, swirling and dragging to the ground like waves. The nearby peaks were all green, completely different. The climate of the island country is mild, but no one can live under Mount Fuji. People in the island country often hear of mountaineering expeditions, regarding it as a wonder;</p>
<p>I went to Yokohama early in the morning to pick up customers the other day. The sky was exceptionally clear this day. As the car approached Yokohama, I suddenly discovered that on the left side, close by, like behind the house, a clear white peak stood, and Mount Fuji was seen again. Looking closely, the top of the mountain was not sharp, but round and wide, not dangerous or steep, clean, elegant, and quiet, very peaceful. It was a pity that it was near and seemed far away, and it was not easy to climb, there was a lot of confusion about not knowing its true face. As the car gradually drove, the mountain gradually appeared more; the green mountains next to it also gradually revealed themselves. It turned out that there were also patches of white dotted between the green mountains, snow sprinkled on the mountains, faintly and vaguely, attracting new interest. Looking up and chasing after it, the green mountains stretched to the north, and suddenly thick snow accumulated, and countless white peaks appeared, not knowing how many snow mountains there were! The island country is small, but it also has these strange places.</p>
<p>To relentlessly pursue the white snow mountains, layer upon layer, rising and falling; but the car was running very fast, turning into a low place, the snow mountains suddenly disappeared and appeared, gradually moving away and blurring, only able to sigh distantly.</p>
<p>By the time I returned in the afternoon, I stared intently and saw a large white hemisphere suspended in mid-air. It turned out that Fuji had been mostly covered by electric mist, leaving only a faint trace of the top of the mountain, and it was almost unrecognizable at first glance, like wearing a veil, with a slightly shy look. Fuji, the snow does not melt all year round, when covered by clouds and mist, it is a pity that it can only give people a faint distant view.</p>
<h3>Song of Melancholy</h3>
<p>— Bai Ling</p>
<p>My heart is weighed down by a string of songs of melancholy. My vision is obscured by a grey, indestructible shadow. I dream of scenes from the future of life: red buoys floating in the sea, green grass growing in the desert, people's faces smiling, streets forever filled with the warm sunlight of spring.</p>
<p>I no longer laugh now. My world is too small, so small that I can barely see the sky and can't breathe. The road, I walk without slackening, but it is so vast, a desolate mountain wilderness.</p>
<p>I listen, hearing faint cries from all around. I only hate that the path is filled with a dim light, making it impossible for me to see a single figure.</p>
<p>My heart is weighed down by a string of songs of melancholy. I feel the loneliness and bitterness of the road.</p>
<p>I am lost and confused. I dare not cry, I know that crying is a weak expression of sentimentality! I stroke my throbbing heart, I let my heart calm down. I strain my eyes, I am searching for my companions. Suddenly, a cool and gentle breeze stirs up troubling fantasies, golden light floats before me, I see countless black, strange shadows constantly moving and running wildly.</p>
<p>I am not afraid. But I firmly step on the ground. I clench my hard palms.</p>
<p>I finally found a companion, but my companion is as young as I am. But alas, his heart is also weighed down by a string of songs of melancholy.</p>
<p>I ask him, he shakes his head. He looks at me with gloomy eyes. He just waves his hand, without saying a word. He opens his mouth, but his throat is mute. So sorrowful, yet standing quietly before me.</p>
<p>He keeps looking at me, appearing uneasy, using his fingers to draw on the ground: the world is filled with the sound of songs of melancholy.</p>
<p>I nod. I finally weep. Then, I listen to the distance, that song of melancholy is vast and widespread! When I open my eyes in a small corner of this world, all I see is blackness.</p>
<p>Gradually, I grew familiar with the song of melancholy.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, but hunger grips our throats again, so our stomachs begin to cry out. We sit on a desolate mountain. My companion looks at me, he bites his lip, shakes my hand, puts me down in the woods, lets me lie down. And also jumps up violently. I shout loudly:</p>
<p>—I am hungry! I need to eat!</p>
<p>A bitter look flits across his face, after a long while, he</p>
<p>—I am also hungry...</p>
<p>He finally speaks. I then know his throat is not mute.</p>
<p>We walk again. But the night is deep. There is no home on the desolate mountain, nor will-o'-the-wisps.</p>
<p>Then, my companion sings a song of melancholy:</p>
<p>Our world has no spring,</p>
<p>Wandering the night roads, climbing the mountain wilderness!</p>
<p>...</p>

<h3>"National Defense Big Secret" Screening A Very Interesting Story</h3>
<p>"National Defense Big Secret", 3) Steps Robert Du奈　　　 Shan Enchou Ji" is the only great contribution, and it is co-starred by the beautiful star Madeline Carroll. The film has been released in Daguanming, so its story is briefly described below,</p>
<p>At the beginning of the screen, we see a reporter in a certain concert hall, who is introducing the magic of the spiritual scholar Taitais to the audience, saying that regarding all past questions, no matter how big or small, the audience can answer them in常场: unexpectedly, a fight suddenly broke out on the stage at that time, and as soon as the gunshot rang, the audience rushed out of the door. At that time, a mysterious woman, with the help of the young man Hanna, was able to safely leave the dangerous situation. Then, at the request of the woman, he took her back to her residence. After talking, he learned that Professor Qiaodun, who had lost a finger from his right hand, was trying to reveal the important secrets of the British military, and she was a female spy whose job was to侦察 the whereabouts of the professor. Unfortunately, the woman was robbed in Hanna's residence the next morning, so Han decided to continue to take on the woman's work.</p>
<p>From a map left by the woman, Han learned that the professor's main office was in Scotland, and immediately took a car to go. On the way, Han suddenly discovered that because of the suspicion that the woman had been assassinated, the detective had been追踪 and arrived. Han escaped back and forth in the car, and later, because the situation was dangerous, he had to escape into a carriage, pretending to be the lover of a strange woman, pulling her and kissing her strongly. But this can only deceive for a moment, and the result is that the detective's pursuit is urgent, on the fourth iron bridge, abandoning the car to escape.</p>
<p>Hanna flew over mountains and ridges, and after all kinds of dangers, finally arrived at the professor's house. After the professor learned of Han's intentions, he raised his gun to shoot him, fortunately, the bullet just shot on the Bible in Hanna's pocket, and he was not injured. Han then used this as evidence to sue the police station, but the professor has a very high status in the society, who can believe it, so Han was arrested instead. Not long after, Han designed to escape again, hiding in a political conference场, and was mistaken for a candidate, but at this time a woman came, the woman's name was Mela, who had been strongly kissed by him in the train before, believing that he was a murderer, rushed out to report, so Han's father was arrested, and then the detective used Ba as a witness, forcing her to go to the official office together. When the car arrived in the wilderness, because it was blocked by a flock of sheep, it could not move forward, and when the detective got out of the car to inspect, fearing that Ba would escape, he locked Han and Ba together in a handcuff.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity to take advantage, Han forced Ba to escape to a small inn, pretending to be a honeymoon couple. After Han fell asleep, Ba tried to remove the handcuffs and tried to escape, but when he walked to the stairs, he suddenly heard the professor's accomplices talking on the phone inside the inn, and learned that what Hanna said was indeed not a lie, so he returned to the room. The next morning, he told Han about this, and told him that the professor and others would be in the London Palladium Theater and something would happen. Han and others追踪 and went, not only did everything come to light, but there was also an unexpected surprise ending, which only invited everyone to enjoy on the screen.</p>
