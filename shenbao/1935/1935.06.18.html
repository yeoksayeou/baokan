<p>時評</p>
<h3>所望於各學術團體年會考者</h3>
<p>— 宣</p>
<p>據報載中國科學社將聯合若干自然科學學術團體在廣西梧州合開年會。而中國敎育學會也將聯合研究敎育之學術團體在北平合開年會。這眞是可喜的現象。惜今年發起太早。尙有若干性質類似的學術團體。因時促不及加入此南北同時舉行的兩大聯合年會。我深望今年國內各學術團體開年會時。一致議决於明年開年會時。聯合舉行。並卽席推出籌備委員。早日籌備。以期完善。地點由籌備委員開聯席會議時决定。性質暫分爲兩大類。一爲自然科學。一爲社會科學。</p>
<p>或問明年年會。一切學術團體何不皆聯合舉行。本來能辦到如此最好。不過一則人數太多。恐集會塲所不易選擇。二則興趣不同。恐聯合會議程不易安排。我提議明年年會暫分上列兩大類。如明年辦理成續不差。則後年不妨再事擴大。以後每逢單年則分兩地舉行。每逢雙年則合而爲一。</p>
<p>至於舉行聯合年會的好處甚多。第一。各種性質相似的學術團體。相聚一堂。不獨有許多共同與相關問題。可以互相研討。即不同問題亦可互聆高。論以收切磋之效。且互受精神上之鼓舞。情感上之團結。其影响於中國學術前途。將甚遠大。</p>
<p>第二。關於舟車問題。聯合舉行年會。人數旣多。往返舟車。可包定整隻船或數節車。費用比半價優待票還省。且在途中可於會前先行交換意見。互相認識。會後再繼續討論未盡事宜。</p>
<p>第三。開會地點可以普遍。而各地招待亦較簡單。全國學術團體每年舉行年會的不下一二十處。分地舉行。各地方招待不勝其煩。且因費用關係。一向開會多在沿江沿海各省。故邊遠省分希望學術團體去開。會而無會往開至東南各埠則實已厭於迎送。今後若能聯合舉行。則開會地點可以普及全國。而各地招待亦易辦理。</p>
<p>第四。可爲合組中國學會之先聲。世界各國幾莫不有全國學會的組織。中國學術團體雖多。尙無一整個組織。殊爲憾事。今先聯合舉行年會。一俟時機成熟。卽可合組一全國學會。將來分工合作。對於中國及世界學術上的貢獻必可較大。且對內可以團結。對外可以一致。便利良多。</p>
<p>聯合開年會的其他好處尙多。現不一一贅述。不過我進一步更望今後各學術團體開年會時。以學術研討爲主。應酬游覽爲次。以往年會有許多團體在開會日程上。往往應酬游覽佔總時間一半以上。殊失學術團體開年會的本意。我以爲卽有游覽。應在年會閉幕後舉行。而應酬則以當地各機關聯合公宴一次爲限。當地各機關不妨節此餘資聘到會專家於會後或會前作公開演講。這於學術之促進或不無裨益。</p>
<p>近來國內學術團體日見發達。年會問題亦較重要。故我敢貢一得之愚。就正於各學術團體。</p>

<p>外相霍爾今日在下院答覆關於「滿洲國」石汕專賣權之詢問、謂英國提出反對專賣權之抗議後、未接有日本覆文、同時專賣權業已見諸實施、英美油商遇此環境、除退出「滿洲國」市塲外、別無他法、渠聞撤退條件將由英美油公司與　滿」當局討論之、英政府對於此項專賣權及日政府責任之意見、已充分載見於四月二十九日之照會文中云、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英德海軍談判　意國復文送英</h3>
<p>今日報紙詳載英德海軍談話、觀察報之外交記者宣稱、上星期五李朋特羅浦與外相霍爾談話時、已覓得一基礎協定、其所未决者均係恊定中之細則、大槪屬於技術性質、此項談話之價値、大槪在於决定如何可以訂一更廣大協定之方法、倫敦方面無人不以爲接受德國之建議係破壞凡爾賽和約、但無關宏旨也、斯特萊薩會議通過及日內瓦確定之協定顯然假定凡爾賽和約中之第五欵已歸無效、職是之故、英人認斯特萊薩會議所决定之原則與目前之英德海軍諒解並無抵觸云、泰晤士報稱、英國之海上霸權、已不若戰時之强、惟政治狀况則頗有利、現德國所議者兩國艦隊之戰鬥力、恒成一種用率、兩國各視對方之計劃决定其艦隊之戰鬥力、德國無意在歐洲海上作戰其意甚明、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>廣州通信、近日社會經濟崩潰、不但商務因之衰落、卽交通運輸機關、亦收入驟减、故近來粵省各大鐵路路局、對於管理上、營業上、均有興革、茲將各路概况詳述如次、</p>
<p>廣九鐵路　此路由廣州至香港、中英合辦、分中英兩段、自去年改訂路約後、滿擬路務有所發展、詎事實上反呈暗淡氣象、其主因、一、年來香港商務一落千丈、往來客貨大不如前、二、往來省港者有日夜輪船數艘、常川往來、且此種省港輪、月來大减船費、外國公司輪船客票、有售至一角至三角者、因之中下階級來往港粵間、多捨陸而趨舟、廣九車受此影響、勢亦不得不貶售車票、以與競爭、營業收入、因而銳减、刻下該路每天收入僅三千餘元、比從前每天短少千餘元、該路爲補救計、日來計劃擴充貨運、由車務處負責籌備、爲適應社會要求起見對於運貨費擬從廉徵收、以廣招徠、</p>

<p>廣三鐵路　本爲粵漢路南段之支綫、路綫由廣州至三水、途經南海佛山三水各屬、當全盛時、獲利爲中國鐵路之冠、蓋路綫短而車費高昻故也、詎近來亦有不勝今昔之慨、其根本影響、在於南海佛山工業之不振、農村破產、此外則因其他</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>真實是長青的松柏，不斷地泉流，又好比人身上不滅的單腺胞，所以真實是不朽的，無窮的，抓住了真實，可以有返白髮為為紅顏樣的妙處，脫離了真實，雖生人也成為行屍走肉。</p>
<p>我們計劃好做一件事，便應該立刻去做，決不可坐失良機，等到時過境遷，再想從事，便要來不及了，許多人在因循苟且之中，貽誤了他的一生，等到年來老去，就是要努力，也已有所不及。</p>

<h3>搶帽子</h3>
<p>— 堯父</p>
<p>一種行業，各有各的『術語』：尤其是癟三流氓的『切口』特別多。『切口』也者，便是『術語』；不過切口帶些神秘色彩，跟謎語廋詞有些類似。術語是專門名詞，譬如流氓口中的寡老·老蟹·釘稍·裝筍頭等等，不是跟大律師口中的法益·繼承·準禁治產。假扣押……等，一同都是『術語』嗎？</p>
<p>『搶帽子』是兩種行業共有的專門名詞：癟三的搶帽子，切口呌做『拋頂宮』『捉烏龜』，跟『拉黃牛』—拉人力車過橋——『錄豬玀』，是一般的不法行為。交易所朋友的揩些油水，也有『搶帽子』的專門名詞，這些可不是『拋頂宮』的小癟三，所有的常識了。</p>
<p>交易所是法定公開的大賭場，你老人家大聲疾呼『百業不景氣，糊口不容易，簡直是一個傻子—無論三五百萬的賣空買空，撈十萬二十萬·易如拾芥。便如小夥計搶搶帽子，一天撈十元二十元，也很容易。</p>
<p>甚麼叫做『搶帽子』？在交易所市場上的朋友，耳朵聽到甚麼消息，—其實等於謠言—果然價格漲　跌了起來，這是『搶帽子』的絕妙機會到了，稍縱即逝，一般伸手的朋友—交易所裏叫做經紀人或代理人—便趁火打刦，推波助瀾，或賣出五萬，或買進十萬，見有一二角油水可撈，便當盤或次盤了結，至少可得到五十元或一二百元，不算甚麼希罕。</p>
<p>你想，交易所裏一天開做四盤，每盤有十四五種類別，每種少則二三個價格，多則有二十餘個價格。交易所裏的『伸手將軍』每天的進欵，不是『麥克』『麥克』嗎？—交易所當然尤其是麥克麥克。</p>
<p>因為賺錢的容易，所以逛跳舞，跑狗，狂賭，濫嫖，是不算什麼一回事。而門檻精明的朋友，便一變而成財翁了。然而，討姨太太，造洋房，坐汽車，總是罷不了的，任你是怎樣精明吝嗇的朋友。因為孟夫子早已說過，所謂『食·色·性也』。的緣故。</p>
<p>『百業不景氣，糊口不容易』。真是荒誕無稽的話。</p>
<h3>划船</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>四個人從吳家館吃了飯出來，又在橋頭化兩角錢買了一簍枇杷，南翔當地的產物，偏要偽稱洞庭山的「白沙」，小販的淺溥的欺騙真氣人，其實正不必怪內地的人，都市中一輩所謂巨商，又何嘗不用欺騙手腕呢？</p>
<p>到了「北海」，不過是一條河流罷了，這條河船家都稱它「南翔港」，一面通。「上海」，一面通「嘉定」。運窯貨，裝洋蔥，菜蔬，載豬羊牲畜的船隻，一天到晚來往不絕，河面上真熱鬧，也有犬吠，也有雞啼，也有孩子的哭叫，男女的嘻笑聲。</p>
<p>我們羨慕水面上的生活，便顧了兩只小船，我跟朱少飛合劃一只，王琢跟劉春華合劃一只，有一個婦人替我們在船尾當舵「咭哩咯，咭哩咯」，水在我們的槳板上分開而又複合，合而又告分開，這樣，我們的小船漸漸劃出了南翔鎮，岸上見到濃茂的樹蔭，綠竹，草舍，荊棘編成的籬笆。</p>
<p>王琢的船起初在我們的前面，後來被我們用務追過了，反而落在後面一丈遠，劉春華把外衣脫去努力的劃著追我們，朱少飛說：「我們還要前進，前進，」於是，兩隻船在無意中起了競爭的形勢。這正和社會和生活一樣，社支和生活的方式，是競爭的，是決鬥的，因此，時代是進展了。</p>
<p>天上黑雲中有雨點扔下來，河面浮旋著無數的圈圈，我們進程受到了阻礙，聽了船婦的勸導，暫且劃到一個樹蔭下面，躲一躲風雨。河面上頓時沉寂了，只有嗶嗶的雨聲在樹叢上叫。我們把兩只船劃靠著一起，預備抵抗某一種勢力的襲擊似的。我們翻起外衣的領子，悠閑地吸起煙來了。</p>
<h3>將來之天空！</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十四回　別有悟心西人談建設不無遺憾寒十種相思</p>
<p>他說完了這句話，才正面兒的向北海看著。北海臉是朝了那面，志前看不到他是何情景。不過他那腳步，始而想移動著向前，不久可又縮腳向後退了。他站著不動。不曾說得什麼。那月英姑娘，一雙烏眼珠，滴滔滔的向這裏轉著。他的身子，好像是被那木門框吸住，緊緊的靠著。這樣，雨人都不動，約莫有上十分鐘。北海倒有些像忍耐不住，伸了膝，向前面就鑽。月英呢，本來是沒有走動的樣子。只因北海起勢那樣的莽撞，身子也突然，向後一縮。北海走過去幾步時，看到人家縮了轉去，站著就是一怔。不過月英縮到了門裏面去了以後，卻也不曾立刻走開，又是轉了眼睛，微微的向北海一笑。正在那時，他就院子裏有人說話聲，月英答著話，就走了進去了。北海這倒很驚慌也立刻向巷子口外走去。志前不張望了，恨快的，由小西天後門，走向了大門口，更由門口的大街，轉身到旁邊的橫街上，只一拐彎，走過兩戶人家，就和北海頭相遇。北海是直了視線向前走路的，好像並沒有看到志前過來。志前只好站住了腳，連連叫了他幾聲。他這才交定了腳，臉上紅著，向志前一鞠躬道：程先生出來散步嗎？志前道：對了，在旅館裏悶得無聊。你這兩天，怎麼不來補課呢？北海笑道：怎麼好老讓程先生盡義務哩？志前道：你這話，就客氣得無味了。你想，我不盡義務，不能收你九塊錢一個月的學費嗎？（二四二）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>輪流著演奏。這種細樂，本來已是很好聽的，如今到了水面上，又有那柔和的風聲，合著碎玉般的水聲一起夾雜在內，頗覺分外的清幽悅耳了。雖然音節並不怎樣高，但越是細微輕柔，便越發令人回腸蕩氣，感到非常的舒適。還有那兩艘小船是做什麼的呢？那是等於兩間水上膳房。上面載著幾座小型的爐灶，和一班專司烹調的太監，以便端正太後的午膳；這是伊早就吩咐下的。</p>
<p>李蓮英還是像往日一樣，無論太后有什麼舉動，不管是正經的朝禮，或是尋常的遊宴，他總是負責支配一切的總指揮。遊湖自然也少不了他。還有那張德，總管照料茶水和飲食的大太監，也帶著他手下的兩名小太監，一起在御舟上承值著。太后自已依舊是極尊貴地獨坐在伊的御座上，由我們分兩邊肅立拱衛。</p>
<p>「啊！到得這晨，真可說是極盡賞心悅目之致了！」老佛爺用著很溫柔的聲調。又像自語，又像向我們說話似的讚賞道：「所以說，一個人也不可一味的忙於幹正事，必須劃出相當的時間來從事遊息。」</p>
<p>這時候的每一分鐘·甚至每一秒鐘·對於伊老人家都是很寶貴：很歡樂的；伊也一些不敢懈怠·準備利用所有的時間·盡情享受。只要看了伊臉上所透露的神情·便可以很明白地見到。</p>
<p>御船上還有一種特殊的裝飾，也是外邊所不經見的：原來在那中央一支船杆上，其實不能說是桅杆，因為字根本不需掛什麼帆，倒是稱做旗杆的來得切實。——除掉掛著一面很大很美麗的龍之外，另有兩根狹長的飄帶，那是兩根天青色的緞帶，隨著風勢，望後面的船尾吹去；這兩根飄帶委實是太長了，它們可以一直飄到水面上去，在那舟行時所留下的一道水痕裏掠過，轉出無數的圓紋來。又因它他的本身已給水所浸透的緣故，每當陽光照到它他時，真有虹一般的美麗。（三四二）</p>

<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>豆腐</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>豆腐一件物品，含有滋養料甚多，食之既合於衛生，又頗有益於身體，價廉物美，是一種最平民化而有益的食品。在天氣漸漸熱度高漲的時候，每日所應用的菜肴，不能太覺油膩，使胃口悶脹，必須要一種清爽的鮮腴的食品，方能合於夏季的口味，豆腐自最為適宜了。因豆腐是一種清腴而嫩淡的食品，只要配煮得宜，便可以成許多味的肴饌和羹湯，比較了山珍海　，還覺得清腴不能比擬豆腐咧。</p>
<p>豆腐有老嫩兩種，老的硬於嫩的，在北方的豆腐，都是老豆腐，似白石般的一塊，可以把秤鉤，在豆腐上稱豆腐的重量，硬度便可想而知了。蘇州有一種水豆腐，養在水內，比了嫩豆腐還得嫩上幾分，非得用匙杓不能取出，同豆腐花相仿。不論是硬的老的嫩的水的各種豆腐，都可以製成絕美的菜肴和羹湯，以下的幾種，便是最合於夏令的豆腐食品。</p>
<p>雞蛋豆腐花　用雞蛋一枚調和，嫩豆腐四十文搗爛，與雞蛋拌和，先用蝦米一百支，將酒浸透，煮汁一飯碗，俟蝦米鮮味一盡入湯內為度，傾出待用，以豬油少許置鍋內燒紅，將雞蛋所拌之豆腐傾入，略煎，即成塊狀，乃以蝦米汁注入鍋內，再加鹽　，陳酒，味精各少許，蓋鍋煮沸，至豆腐與雞蛋結凝為度，即成此美味之雞蛋豆腐花，味鮮而腴，較之四川館中之雞豆，且勝數倍，而價又絕廉，不足小洋一角，真為平民化之豆腐食品。</p>
<p>乳腐露燉豆腐　以酒糟乳腐之露半飯碗，加以嫩豆腐三塊搗碎，略加鹽花，陳酒，隔水燉之，至豆腐凝結為度，又為一奇鮮而清腴之素質豆腐，夏令食之最宜，惜酒糟乳腐露一品，上海是不易得的。</p>
<p>鍋貼豆腐　鍋貼豆腐是京川館中的名饌，法用老豆腐切成寸余大小的方片，厚約二三分，塗以雞蛋白，入豬油鍋內兩面煎黃，加入蝦米屑，味精，醬油，陳酒，白糖，及水　杓，蓋鍋以急火煮透，至水度將乾，湯已濃厚為度，則蝦米味精等鮮汁，已透入豆腐，即成此美味之鍋貼豆腐了。</p>
<p>生鹽豆腐　以生豆腐一塊，加醬油，麻油或辣油同拌，即成清爽無比之生鹽豆腐，下酒食粥，皆稱美饌，惟醬油須佳，以蝦子醬油或母油為上，若加以蝦子與火腿屑同拌尤佳。</p>
<p>以醬，蔥，白糖，和豆腐同燉，味極濃厚而鮮美，惟醬須自制之豆醬為佳，以鮮而純潔，若加以辣油，蝦子更妙，為夏令食品中之爽口的一種。且種豆腐食品還多。如豆腐羹，蝦仁，蟹粉豆腐，一品豆腐，都是極鮮美的菜羹，不過比了以上所述的幾種，價目均貴，沒有以前的平民化了。</p>
<h3>記友人王君軼事</h3>
<p>— 君謀</p>
<p>余友王君，北平人，略具資產，父早故，母年已五旬，畢業於工科大学，曾在沪任工程师，有女友密司李，敏慧多恣，體態尤健，素為王君年敬仰，一日，王群忽接家电促归，待至家，始悉乃母因自身年高，娶媳望孫之心尤切，祇緣王君擇偶太慎，迄未缔姻，今乃母实行強迫婚制，訂定同郡姜女士為媳，特先托故，電促王歸，即擇某日為之完姻，王君不忍再拂母意，祇得俯首受命，完成婚事，夫人姜氏，果亦美而健，且畢業醫科大學，王君得此良伴，自亦欣幸，又奉母命家居，乃需職滬江，任北平某廠工程師，如此數年，南方緒友，音信斷查，李女士亦已嫁矣，隨後國府建都南京，平市日衰，王君復辭職南遷，在申任路工程師，偕同老母嬌妻，賃屋而居，姜亦應某醫院之聘，任婦科醫，王君整理　櫃，偶獲昔日李所贈肖像，不覺引起前情，而思有以探伊近況為快，乃示其夫曰，此為余所欽佩之女友宓司李也，今不知伊近況久矣，越數日姜於臨症時，遇一病婦，形容憔悴，而似相識，頗異之，視掛號單，載有施李氏字樣，察伊病情，乃淋濁性白帶，因拖延日久，影響全身，面黃肌瘦，姜即囑伊逐日注射處方，以治全身疾病，又囑同上海法租西新橋街德行裏一號，同仁西藥社，購外用白帶藥及內服白帶丸各一盒，每盒二元，如法服用，王君夫婦閑談，述及此重，王一聞李氏，引動心念，若有所感，姜見而恍然曰，病婦與君示儂之照相，肖若一人，儂當為君探問之，次日，施李氏來復診，病勢已減，姜為之治療既畢，乃問曰，有北平王某，君知之否，病婦驚訝曰，儂果相識，而今久無音問矣，姜曰，王與儂一家人也，遂約於某曰，邀同施李夫婦及知友多人，敘餐於王君家，從此施王相交，姜李愛如姊妹，施果花柳暗疾甚深，又由姜介紹赴法租界寧波路六十四號，孫緯才父子醫院，行適當治療，不多時均而復健康矣，</p>

<h3>紗花　外紗不絕傾銷　本紗大受打擊　千後跌風又起…各月降落一元餘</h3>
<p>紗市晨平午跌、局勢異常悲觀、蓋因外紗在市頻頻跌價傾售、於是人心動搖、華紗大受打擊、至於本月份受經濟衰敗影響、收貨者殊覺艱雞、故市氣頗虛、</p>
<p>金雞外商大量拋賣</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因報載察事已和平解决、有一部分空頭抵補、多頭活動購買、市盤尙堪維持、結果各月比上日收盤價漲。　角、遠月勿動、午後開盤、市盤突然下降、且跌勢愈熾、因外商大量拋出、另有一說、外紗在市跌價求售、而布疋市價還比紗市爲低、因此外商對於標紗極端看小、壓力殊强也、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一元至一元三角、查賣出吉豐四百包、大孚二百包、益大六百包、大豐七百包、慎記四千包、義成四百包、達記四百五十包、長餘四百包、大昌成四百包、同和五百五十包、信誠八百包、買進吉豐八百包、瑞大　千六百包、大昶五百包、　人四百包、益大一千一百包、裕大八百包、明德一千一百五十包、潤康一千包、新華四百五十包、一日問最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>棉市近日市塲空氣、謂般棉商、由空翻多、心思看高、對於本月有收貨軋空之說、然存棉濃厚、事實上壓迫甚得、不易反動、兼之紗市下落、廠方對於原棉、絕無進胃、陳花前途、仍少樂觀也、</p>
<p>鄭標午後又跌</p>
<p>標花前市所盤、因美印棉市上升、有一部分心意看潑、且瑞大扒空、市氣帶昂、結果本月比上日收盤價勿動、遠漲一角、午後開盤突然下落、因紗市大跌、且各路均得甘霖、棉田獲益匪淺、且陳花充足、廠幣杜絕、於是賣風又起、七八兩月又敲破一元關口、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌　角至三角半、查賣出森康一千七百擔、愼昌二千一百擔、合興一千三百擔、同孚一千擔、均昶一千擔、愼記一千三百擔、益昶二千七百擔、大昶一千一百擔、潤康三千六百擔、牛源千擔、益康一千五百擔、買進吉豐千七百擔、大孚四千七百擔、合興一千擔、瑞大二千五百擔、益康一千一百擔、錦昌千五百擔、泰興三千六百擔、益昶、千七百擔、長豐二千一百擔、一日間最高低價及收盛價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　一雨而米價為小</h3>
<p>本米昨日滬南來源、到有二十七號（貨共五千餘石）、市况自前日一番大雨後、人心頓餒銷塲不化、故各貨行情暴瀉、雖天時晴旱無常、然在此一二朝內、恐亦難以轉色、各厚粳價回落三四角不等、各晚稻雖秦皇島帮去三百餘包、而行情貶落不小、變陰元削二尺、杜尖相仿、（滬北）昨日河下各路到船雖無幾、因內地各處已得霉雨二三寸、致人心向下、各貨去胃寂寞、市價白粳回短二三角、早薄稻亦小二角左右、其餘各貨亦小近角、惟白　到銷兩和、價形定局、</p>

<h3>漫畫資料</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>爲着「具象化」，要刻畫得詳細，又須避免武斷的嫌疑，文學總是注重「描寫」的。描寫的缺點是費事，因爲作者的意見，只能由于「弦外之音」的暗示，所以總要寫了一大堆，才能勾表達作意，不如「序述」的來得直捷痛快。</p>
<p>序述雖然簡單明瞭，但是抽象的，沒有象描寫的能勾使得讀者得到深刻的印象；只可以用在賓位陪襯等不重要的地方。因此，文學以描寫爲原則，在一篇之中，也要以描寫爲主體。</p>
<p>對于題材的採用，同繪圖比較，文學的長處是不受時間和空間的拘束；就是于許多地方發生，經歷了許多時候的事情，都可以寫在一篇里面。綸畫可不行、除掉「未來派」的稍能延長時間打破點空問的阻隔，同照相一樣，在一幅之中，只可以表現于一剎那間在一處地方所有的情形。</p>
<p>不過繪畫，總是根本由于描寫的；又是平面的，看去一目了然，不象文學的　一定要閱讀了許多時候才可以明白其中的意義。而且繪畫上的描寫來得省事，更其是漫畫，不必由于什麼色彩和筆觸，只要綫條和輪廓，寥寥的幾筆，就可以表現各種情調，顯明作意了。</p>
<p>從前在成都，時常聞見到這種情形，就是學生坐包車，校長坐散車，敎員徒步。每當傍午傍晚，經過學校的門口，正在散學的時候，總要發生些感想；以爲這種情形，對照得很强烈，但只可以做漫畫的資料，不便寫作小說，因爲，如果只是序述，簡簡單單，淡而元味；要是描寫起來，費事得很，也不會怎麼出色。可是利用繪畫的方式，這種題材，倒是容易動人，可以事半功倍的，所以認作漫畫的資料，並不想寫進小說里面去。</p>
<p>這次在輪船上，又碰着了相樣的事情，就是着作家蹲在統艙的一角，書店老闆坐在房艙中，讀者高臥在唐滄樓的官艙里。這情形，覺得比學生坐包車，校長坐散車，和敎員徒步的對照得更强烈，但也以爲只可以用作漫畫資料。自然，不但只是表明着作家在統艙中蹲着，書店老闆在房艙內坐着，和讀者在官艙里高臥着爲已足，還得把這三種人的姿態和神情都細細的刻畫出來；是多方面的、複雜的。</p>
<p>我又以爲不必替敎員和著作家抱不平，因爲他們，有的原也是由這樣的學生和讀者過來的；坐着包車，高臥在官艙里的學生和讀者，照目前的社會狀况，將來學成以后，當了敎員，做了著作家，也是難免只好陸上徒步，海行蹲到統艙的一角去的。這兩種題材，只要畫得適合，一定很醒目，委實是漫畫的好資料，不過，這樣寫成功小品文，也是並非不可以的罷！</p>
<h3>人造瘋子（中）</h3>
<p>— 何洛</p>
<p>衣裳扯破了。頭髮一撮一撮的掉下來，扯開頭皮，鼻子嘴裏都流着血。</p>
<p>泥土和血，和汗調成污淋淋的醬汁。</p>
<p>這樣的混戰就一天一天的繼續着。好像他們都是天生的打手，一天不打架，他們就活不下去了。</p>
<p>有時候，打架的形勢改變了。二三個人聯合起來對準一個人。但打敗的並不屈服，長長的躺在地上，一直到啞喉嚨破嗓子，沒有氣力了，還是在抗戰着。</p>
<p>母親是最倒楣的一個，兒子們一打架，父親就把她當做一倒水的缺罐子」，傾倒一切惡氣在她一個人身上，駡她，打她，說這些都是她生下的好兒子。這些狗樣的只會打架的兒子。</p>
<p>照中國的傳統精神，當然父親是有道理的。而且兒子們也都早已學會打他們自己的老婆了。</p>
<p>只有第四個兒子還沒有娶老婆。但並不是因爲這緣故，他就比哥哥們更利害點：倒是父親母親都偏愛着他，從小就把他培植成家裏的霸王；從小就會扯住父親的鬍子，呌着父親的名字，並且嬉笑的駡父親了。所不同的，現在他可以跑在街上呌着名字駡，或是跑在院子跟前的土崖上，父親無論如何都捉不住他了。</p>
<p>父親對於他，雖然沒有先前那樣的好臉色，好言語，但他的心裏到底還是偏愛着他。只希求他不要這般忤逆。而且他始終替他計畫着，拔尖子的好地，一定要分給他。</p>
<p>其餘的兄弟們就忌恨他。</p>
<p>每個人都想分到好地，並且多分一點。每個人都燃燒着一種醜惡的食慾，如果少一個人，財產分到自己名下就可以多富點。而且都反對父親給四兄弟劃分結婚費用的打算。</p>
<p>在父親只想懲治他一下。但是在兄弟就有更高的目的了，都想把他趕出去。</p>
<p>就在推倒父親的第二天，他回來吃午飯，豪不提防的就給兄弟們捉起來，用繩子背綁着，拴在正房檐前的石頭碌　上。伸長腿，靠緊石階，動也不敢動，一動石頭碌　，就會滾下來連骨頭都可以壓斷。</p>
<p>五月的大太陽，晒在腦袋上，蒸着熱氣：肩膊上滿都是籐條抽下的鞭痕。</p>
<p>由於打人而疲乏的的父親，躺在正房的大炕上，有時坐起來，駡幾句，咒幾聲，又躺下了。</p>
<p>兄弟們都鑽在自己房裏，和老婆孩子們低聲小氣的議論些什麼。</p>
<p>只有母親是慈愛的，陪伴着他坐在石階上，禱告老天爺敎他回心轉意。</p>
<p>他們面前，飛散着打碎的碗片，小米，玉蜀黍麵片兒，幾隻蒼蠅。</p>
<p>有時候，他就喊叫着，咒駡着，表白他並不屈服的意志，聲音是十分痛恨的。</p>
<p>以後不久，母親偷偷的解開繩子，把她心愛的兒子放走了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>他走到什麼地方去了？誰也不知道。</p>
<p>父親不願意人們提起他。</p>
<p>兄弟們只想聽到他的不好的消息。</p>
<p>母親禱告老天爺，保佑他平安無事，指點他一條人生的大路，回來是一個能够獨立成家的好兒子。</p>
<p>第二年春天，他回來了。家庭的空氣，立刻又緊張起來。兄弟們歡迎他的，是一回非常激烈的吵嘴和打架。</p>
<p>他看待一切人，更生硬，更野性。</p>
<p>當父親的念頭轉到一家三代寡婦的遠房千本家的時候，兄弟們都很高興的，母親也高興，他也高興：這是更有利益的，道比父親的四分之一的財產要好的多。</p>
<p>父親計算的很周全，把自己的兒子過房出去，就是給自己多撈一份的財產。名義顯然是巷別人傳種接代，但骨血是自己的，把自己的種子種在別人的田地裏，種子是自己的，蕃殖的實在是目已的一支。而且自己辛苦一輩子，給兒孫後代創造起來的家業，分成三份，所分的要更多些。</p>
<p>父親偏愛着他，因此這獨人獨業的承繼權，父親就心許了他。並且照着自己的心願，用盡心機的策畫着，進行着，敎訓他許多和寡婦們接近的門徑。</p>
<p>大約一年光景，他父子們終於達到了掠奪財產的目的。</p>
<p>但掠奪財產，並不只於他父子們，在寡婦們的近房裏，也有多餘的人口，饞吃懶動盪，張開嘴等飯吃。現在看見別人把這一份好財產承繼了，連眼睛都急紅了。</p>
<h3>「那首詩」</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>「我昨天（給您）」他還在喉嚨口沒有把「給您吐出來，立刻覺得用這兩個字似乎太粗率了一點，兩眼盯着右肩旁她那垂著長黑髮的半面白臉脥眏眼，很快就在腦子里面閃電似的經過一次修辭，於是又紅着臉，發着正確的音說下去：</p>
<p>「我昨天送上的那首詩，您看，覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>她的臉也紅了起來，連耳根頭都紅得透明。因爲她想起昨天那首詩還夾在一本書里，隨手丟在一張檯子上。於是慚愧地把脚步放慢一些，微微抬起臉來，向他看一眼，嘴唇動兩動，才說道：</p>
<p>「對不住。我還沒……」</p>
<p>「不要緊，不要緊，不要緊的。」他趕快向她連連點着頭，說，表示倒是自己非常抱歉的意思。等到一見她又把臉掉向前面走着了，自己就又皺着兩道黑眉，伸一隻手爪抓抓梳得油光的腦後髮脚，嘆一口氣，想：「糟，她又沒有看—究竟她是假痴假呆？是……唉咳，女入！</p>
<p>他緊跟着她的脚跟走。終於决定伸手去挽起她的手：如果她不躱開，那末那詩看不看，都沒有關係了。反正一樣。他這麼一想，便把右手向着她的左手彎伸去，同時不知怎麼隨口含糊的說道：</p>
<p>「那首詩……」</p>
<p>「有人來了！」她臉紅一下，說；趕快向旁邊躱一下。</p>
<p>他一驚地抬起臉來，就看見對面走來兩個歪戴打鳥帽的黃臉漢子。那高的一個向他擠擠小眼睛，那矮的一個就向他伸伸紅舌頭。他於是怒得把嘴唇閉起來了。但他鎭靜着，眼睛掉向一彎，走着。可是當他同她並肩走到那兩個漢子的面前，立刻就聽見劈面送來各種奇怪的聲音：</p>
<p>「咳！唔，咳咳！」</p>
<p>「噓！噓！噓！」</p>
<p>他看見肩旁的她，滿臉通紅，自己也覺得兩頰熱起來了。他避開那兩個傢伙的臉，曙暗估量一下那兩個的挙頭和自己穿着灰法蘭絨西裝的背脊，仍然覺得：「犯不上！」於是鎭靜的走過去了。再看旁邊的她，仍然低着頭，走得更快了，似乎就要離開他走去。他立刻兩眼悵惘地針着她的穿高跟皮鞋的脚跟緊跟兩步，把她趕上：但自己總覺得很抱歉，沒能把她保護着，他幾乎想伸手去撫她的肩，但他立刻警覺，右手仍然挿在褲袋里不動。</p>
<p>「咳！唔，咳！」似乎就在腦後。</p>
<p>「噓！噓！」耳朶尖似乎感到了那吹來的熱的氣息。</p>
<p>他於是氣得臉發靑，一對眼珠挺出來了。但他仍然鎭靜着。一抬頭，忽見對面街的拐角上正出現一個白皮膚高鼻子的黑衣巡捕，左手按在腰間的黑皮槍匣上，右手正一甩一甩地走來。他這下再也鎭靜不住了。一下昂着頭掉轉身來，面對着那兩個歪戴打鳥帽的黃臉。其時走在旁邊的她，忽然吃驚地伸起一隻細指手掌來掩着自己忽然張開的嘴唇，趕快站遠兩步。</p>
<p>「做甚麼！你們？」他臉靑地對着那兩個歪戴打鳥帽的黃臉喝道。哼，你們！這這這……」</p>
<p>那矮的一個把口張大起來，就要準備咆哮；但高的一個已一眼看見高鼻子巡捕正大步走來了，便悄悄扯扯他的衣角：那矮的才立刻把嘴唇改成一個〇字形·說道一聲：「噓！」而且伸一下紅舌頭。兩個就赶快轉身走去了。</p>
<p>做呵！你們？哼！簡直豈有此理！」他兩手叉腰，聳出肩頭，似乎就要進上去。</p>
<p>「算了，讓他們去吧。」站在旁邊的她皺皺眉說。但他終於跨出兩步·站一站·鼻孔里哼出一聲，「哼·流氓！」這才戚到勝利似的轉過身來。昻着頭。滿臉發光地向着她。把穿皮鞋的脚步踏得特別淸脆響亮。走到她面前。</p>
<p>「哼，這些東西，」他說。「不理他，倒以爲是怕他了！不給他們一點利害他們是不知道的。」他說到這里，向着她那白臉上的一對黑白分明水波似的眼珠深深地盯一眼，看她是否在佩服着自己這樣的勇敢。並且，　時覺到“自己在她的面前，好象比剛才馬上大了起來。</p>
<p>當他們並肩走起來的時侯。他又想起了他剛才要挽着她的計畫。「在這勝利之後，不正是好機會麼？」他想。於是不知怎麼地口里又發着含糊的聲音道：「那首詩—」同時右手也就……</p>

<p>我想，這該是夢！</p>

<h3>大學時代（五）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>過了一會兒，一對對跳舞的人都配合起來了。我是男孩子隊中第二人，娜麗就成了我的舞伴。她笑了，當她把手放在我手裏時候。「我們在各人身邊都要跳過啊！」我說。—我們的確照這樣做了。起初學習「瑪茲卡舞」，第一點鐘之後，因為旋廻舞跳得不好，我們的老敎帥已經拿琴弓敲着響盤說：「小波力嘉姑娘！菲力先生！你們二人跳給衆人看吧！「當他彈着并唱着歌曲時候，我們就跳了起來。同她跳舞，并無需甚麼技藝，我相信無論誰都不會跳錯的。但老敎師連聲不絕叫「好！」市長夫人也現出歡快神情微笑着靠倚在沙發上，—功課開始時她就坐在那裏非常細心地觀看了。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂姑娘分配給我的朋友弗里茨做舞伴。我很高興看出，她的活潑的性情不久便使弗里茨忘記他當初對裁縫女兒的欣羨了。現在我旣然相當地把這裁縫女兒當作我的私有物，那麼我的舞伴底美貌和溫柔是我所引爲誇耀的。她那裝束齊整天的敵手底一個注視的眼光，引起了我的注意，我隨着這眼光所向，終於看出，市長夫人疏忽了一件事情”手套太大了，同那雙小手不甚配稱，而且顯然是換洗過了的。</p>
<p>第二天早上我下課回來，便一刻也不能安靜。我衝向衣樹，拿出我那馬口鐵製的撲滿，盡力摸淘，搖動，一直到把一塊銀幣連着口縫那片紅布片了出來。然後我便跑到一個商店去。—「「我要買自色小手套！」我說，帶點惶恐神氣。</p>
<p>店裏夥計用他行家的眼光看了我的手一眼。第洋號！他說，同時把乎套盒子放在桌子上。「讀你給我第五號吧！」我低聲說。</p>
<p>—「第五號？那是帶不上去的」他已經要拿手套較比我的手了。</p>
<p>我臉紅了。「這手套不是給我用的！」我說，此時我比往常更加惋情我沒有一個姊妹，不然我便可以把這事推到她身上去了。但現在那些帶有白絲帶的小手套山經攤開在我面前，我看見了十分高興。我買了二雙。出了商店不久，我便在街上找到一個小孩。一把這個送給娜麗·波力嘉吧！」我說：「說是跳舞用的手套，是市長夫人送來的！回來把情形告訴我；我就在轉角地方等你。」</p>

<h3>剷除魚肉鄕民的土豪劣紳</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>這一次行營爲肅淸匪患保障民衆利益起見，特頒一「修正勦匪區內懲治土豪劣紳條例，」對於一班土豪劣紳，舉凡（一）武斷鄉曲欺壓人民，（二）恃豪估勢朦蔽官廳或變亂是非脅迫官吏，（三）逞强恃衆阻撓政令或地方公益，（四）假借公衆名義派捐派費從中歛財肥己或盤踞公共機關侵蝕公欵，（五）僞造物證指使流氓陷害良善，（六）包庇私設烟賭，（七）因擬派差役公費指官訛詐而剝奪他人身體自由者，皆依法究辦，或處死刑，或處徒刑。這眞是各匪區鄉民之幸！</p>
<p>說起士豪劣紳，誰不知道是一種逞强怙勢，魚肉鄉民的不良份子，他們的行爲，可說是無惡不作。他們盤踞一鄉，儼然是一個土帝皇，橫行不法予取予求，他們的罪惡，在上面條例上所舉，還是犖犖大者。要把他們的罪狀，詳細羅列出來，實不是幾項條例所能盡。總之，他們簡直就是個罪大惡極的魔王！一，般善良鄉民之遭受他們的壓迫，其痛苦情狀，眞不可形容。然鄉民處其淫威之下，皆畏之如虎狼，亦無奈他們何！</p>
<p>近幾年來，各地鄉民憤無可洩，於是而走入歧途，有人認這是因爲鄉民無知，受人蠱惑所致。其實鄉民之受人蠱惑者，固有其人。而鋌而走險者究居多數。故要拯救今日的匪區，懲治土豪劣紳，實屬要舉。</p>
<p>然我國土豪劣紳之蹂躪鄉民，豈僅限於匪區而已。凡屬鄉村，到處皆有這種敗類存在。是以我們若期望土豪劣紳絕跡，應把這種懲治土豪劣紳的法令，擴充至全國，作一番普遍澈底的剷除。蓋非如此，不足以言保障鄉民的利益！</p>
<h3>屠夫</h3>
<p>— 方之中</p>
<p>村景；從「芒種」亢旱到「白露」，人的眉睫毛也被煎炙得伸不直軀幹。</p>
<p>人物：拜菩薩，抬「狗老爺」求雨的法子失效後，「瘟神」倒不請自來地光顧到他們。</p>
<p>「福無變至，禍不單行啦！」</p>
<p>家有病者的人全這樣嘆息着。</p>
<p>瘟疫有眼睛睛；首先抓住孩子讓大人焦灼一會，又輪到大人身上，一家兩家，而至於全村。沒水喝，自然更沒藥吃；醫生閒着手瞧這筆生意打眼前跑過，失了信的菩薩不用說，更倒楣，—再沒人去求他。</p>
<p>「眞是刦數，天收拾人！」</p>
<p>一碰着難題，尤其是老年人好說這是「刦數」，「天意」，原因是沒有眞命天子出現，人心變壤了；懂得點歷史的老秀才們了還會搬出「五胡亂華」的故事做他的論證。並且他們有時還舉出某一個皇帝風調雨順，國泰民安，十幾個小錢一升米，七八個小錢一斤鹽，生了病，買藥和請翳生，幾百錢便足够開銷，現在到了「末年」，一切都有機會使他們回味逝去的「盛世豐年。」</p>
<p>無論白畫和黑夜，火箭似的風仍滿勇敢地掃射着，森林響起深秋蕭瑟的調子，人們心田和稻田一同龜裂得片片欲飛。</p>
<p>雖然沒飯吃，然而誰也不情願家里死人。可是病的發展却異常神速，一個徵候：上吐下瀉帶發熱。不到一對時，病人就會死。</p>
<p>山後李八爺的兒子死後，沒一天工夫，李八爺也歸天了：然而李八爺是蕃良的，大家全這樣說。</p>
<p>這時整個許家村，由饑餓轉跌入死亡的恐怖中。病人的能否從死綫上拖回來，那是要看他祖上的陰功，墳山的風水。</p>
<p>年紀五十上下的江屠夫的兒子也病了，爛桃子眼屠夫婆儘怨着他前些年白刀進，紅刀出，積下無數罪惡，報應到兒子身上，單傅二代，這點根子會救不住；她命不好，前世沒有修鍊，現在懺悔也來不及，但她自信一世沒有作惡，要是兒子死的話，準是，丈夫牽連她的。</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？孩子這樣沉重！」</p>
<p>屠夫婆蹲在一張疊着破單被的床前，探一回兒子頭額上的熱度，又捻着素珠，嘴里喃喃地唸「阿彌陀佛。」這聲音的末尾，接上兒子的撒汚聲：嘩喇——三歲的兒子，把屎撒到床上。屠夫婆來不及拿糞桶，便絕呌起來。</p>
<p>「呌我有天法！」「洞庭湖里斷槳樁」，鬼來救你！」</p>
<p>江屠夫楞着，眞像斷了槳椿沒法子，看水流舟那模樣｛</p>
<p>但他對於李八爺父子死的消息，極端秘密地不讓屠夫婆知道—這死訊是要加重她的恐怖的。（未完）</p>
<p>這屋子座落在許家村一隻山角裏，斑剝的土墻，比蔣屠夫身上那套籃布褂褲的補綻還要多。他們在這僅見天地之一角的地方也單住了三代，假如你從現在的蔣屠夫那種凝重的性格，寒酸的相貌看去，你不會相信他曾做過人們視如殘忍的殺猪老，也不會信任他少年時有過順暢的境遇。然而便是五年前的蔣屠夫、他還是走的順風。</p>
<p>自然他也和祖父及父親一樣帮人做長工，但他有副業，—殺猪，動機是：人到二十五，衣破無人補何况「單傳」的責任，又落到了自己身上；但三十六串錢一年工價，不够娶妻養子，於是他選了這條路。逢五，八，臘三個節日，或紅白喜事，他便請了假去幹這生意，一頭猪，除飽吃飯喝一頓外，尙落得三四千錢和幾斤猪毛，他有了錢，同時做工也勤儉，但使殺猪老身上有鬼，誰也不肯把女兒嫁給他做老婆。</p>
<p>直到三十六上才取來這位屠夫婆，可是到了四十六還沒生兒子，他焦急着，但屠夫婆却把這責任推到他身上：</p>
<p>「老是殺性害命的作惡哪！」</p>
<p>畢竟兒子比錢重要，他决定不幹這勾當、便請了幾個和尙來家拜懺、把刀埋到土裏。</p>
<p>果然第二年屠夫婆生下一個肥胖胖的兒子了。</p>
<p>「人要行善哪！江屠夫一放下刀，便生了一個兒子呢！」</p>
<p>鄰舍都這樣傳說着。</p>
<p>從懷胎一直到生產。江屠夫夫婦，就像從沙地上拾得一粒黃金那末歡悅，珍愛。</p>
<p>積下來的錢隨着兒子歲月的增長而化消盡了，現在是「天乾，」自己失了業，兒子也生了病，許家村上有田有土的人也沒辦法，而靠勞力召租的他，自然更走頭無路了。他瞧一趙躺在土窗的灰黯下床上的孩子，倚在床沿哭喪着臉的老婆，便又走出來看天。</p>
<p>天，仍是無憂無慮地撑起牠的火傘，連風秧子也斷絕了，他巴望的時辰快速地接近黃昏，覺得黑暗比這種殘酷的光明還稍勝一等。他在這三問一層的短屋子裏街進街出，便像一隻雄獅在樊籠裏奔突那樣着急。屠夫婆又從房裏大呌起來：</p>
<p>「老頭子！神保又撒了啊！眼晴全陷下去了，身上只勝一根刺，瞧不起醫生，也得弄口米湯給他吃！」</p>
<p>「那來的米湯，全村子也找不出米，連樹皮也吃光了，難道你還不知道嗎</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>？」江屠夫在堂屋裏應着、連忙把午飱賸下的半個樹皮耙子拿進來。</p>
<p>「天啊」這硬得像鐵，他怎麼吃得下去啊！」老婆子攔住他的手：「做老子的人總得對得住兒子！」</p>
<p>「逼我死嗎？—這年頭誰做得起老子！誰願意做老子，我情願也做他的兒子哩！」</p>
<p>山後鄭太婆把李八爺父子的死訊帶來了，並且還有用昌麻子的兩個小孩，全家排保章叔的老婆。一句一句全像針鋒剌在屠夫婆的心裏，她冷眼檢查一下自己的兒子，一種奇痛包圍了她的全身。</p>
<p>黃昏終於到來了。神保沉入了彌留深淵，他糞門內僅淌着濁水，眼珠子機械地一翻一翻像洋囡囡那麼地。屠夫婆用手探着兒子的呼息，口裏又唸起「阿彌陀佛菩隆保佑神保。」江屠夫蹣跚地在這黑晤的屋子裏儘踱去踱來，像在找尋什麼似地。突然，</p>
<p>「他鼻子沒有風了！全是你作多了惡，報應到他身上，你連累了我！」屠夫婆連哭帶頓脚。</p>
<p>「誰呌他生在窮人家裏？怪我幹麼？—殺了猪嗎？李八爺父子不曾殺過猪呀！……殺人的也多得很，難道殺猪便是罪惡！」</p>
<p>說着他又去發掘埋在地下的那把刀，做什公用誰也不知道（完）</p>
<h3>子孫太太</h3>
<h3>太陽及其他</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>當自家兒底無窮盡的歲月，不斷地在陰暗中流過去，而且又彷彿測度到了它將永久那樣地在黑暗中流到枯竭的時候，我是多羨慕而且愛好那金黃色的大而康健的向日葵啊！它是永永地勇敢而且幸福的，它是祗靠了太陽才能生活下去的——眞的，它是多麼熱切地期待着這溫熱的，光亮的太陽啊：它永遠地把眼睛瞧着他，它永遠地跟了他而轉動着方向；而，當太陽落下去，它也失掉了歡樂，失掉了生命的勇氣了——在陰地中，我曾看到過它那種倒垂了頭的嘆息沈思的神情，滬是多恰切地表現了一個生命的垂死啊——我明白了：是生活的慘劇！</p>
<p>這樣，爲了自己的弱小的靈魂給長長地幽閉在陰暗的生活的路上，我便時常會想起太陽，想起愛看太陽的大朵的金黃色的向日葵了。也許它還是比較幸福的一個吧——當太陽落了下去以後，當黑夜，當陰天，雖然說太陽是離開了它，沒有金黃色的光，也沒有三春一般的溫煖了；然而它是依舊可以擬想，可以期待，可以希望的啊！難道在泥濘得不適宜於行走的生活的路上，你也能忍心地說：希望僅僅地一個落空的夢，一個不能代表未來之幸福的夢嗎？</p>
<p>而且，在人世間，誰又能否認這作爲光與熱之母親的太陽呢。太陽是康健的，消毒的，每一個醫生都那麼說，每一個生物都那麼想；它是生命養料啊！想一想吧：在生活的立塲上，有誰敢做太陽的叛徒呢？誰反叛太陽的，誰就反叛了充滿着力與康健的生命。</p>
<p>朝夜閃耀在夢裏的光與微笑，該是多麼地美麗，然而，又是和實際的生活多麼不相襯啊。是的，夢與現實是相差得無邊際地遼遠了；在夢裏，我是彷彿生活在溫燥的土地上，有紅的花，綠的小草，也有太陽的金黃色的光，在那兒，路是平滑的，風是輕快的，四周是光亮的無需摸索的，生命是永遠給培養在太陽下面的。</p>
<p>然而，當這照着陽光的夢給破滅，而重又看到自己底生命的時候，世界是已經改變得呌人難以相信了！依然是一縷幼小者的靈魂啊！然而，同着它，我負上了累贅的生命的梏桎，一步步地在泥濘的無邊黑暗的路上踏向前去，在那兒，人已經難以辨別出橫在路前的一堆絆足的磚頭，也難以吸到一口並不汚濁的空氣了。</p>
<p>一天天地拖着生命的擔子在黑暗中摸索着走去，沒有光，也沒有熱。什麼地方才會有盡頭是難料的啊！也許這無邊的黑暗就整整地吞噬了一生，而太陽的輪廓是祇能永遠地讓人在睡夢中去摹擬了吧？——生命的路上是人世間的北極圈，有的就祗是冰雪連年的山與荒土，在那兒，太陽是被當作不易輕見的奇跡的啊！</p>
<p>可是，難道眞的說，生命的花朶是可以滋長在缺少太陽的地帶中的嗎？這有誰能相信呢？在任何的花朵，除了毒菌，是沒有能離去了陽光而生存的，生命的花朵，又怎麼會例外呢？</p>
<p>一天天馱着生命在時日的路上走，心上是多記念着這作爲光與熱之母親的太陽啊；但是，她又和我雜開得多遠呢。</p>
<p>便讓太陽永遠地消失去，便讓這生命的花朶枯萎了罷！</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>敎王弄政</h3>
<p>— 南京映</p>
<p>金城也得裝冷氣設備</p>
<p>滬上第一輪電影院，大都放映外國片，開映國產片者，現在雖有金城新光兩家：但新光有時仍映外國片，所以再說得嚴格點，實在祗有金城是專映國片的戲院，因此金城影戲院，遂成爲國片影迷的唯一消閒地。</p>
<p>在上海，國產片的聲勢，及不來外國片那樣浩大，照現在情形考察起來，倒並非國產片之不能受人歡迎，實在因爲它的產量太少，就像金城大戲院，最初的時候，祗有聯華公司的一家的出品，在它那裏放映，據說也常常感到片荒；不過因爲他們抱定了一個「提倡國產影片」的主旨做去，到了現在，除聯華外，巳有藝華，電通，天一，新時代和吉星等公司的出品，先後在該院放映，而月明公司出品的『昏狂」，亦將繼「人之初」後在該院公映了。</p>
<p>暑期已屆，凡裝有冷氣設備的戲院，大都已經開放冷氣，金城大戲院，去夏卽已裝有冷氣機，可惜不能十分滿意。聽說該院今年復犧牲巨資，請上海最負有聲譽的冷氣專家約克洋行，改裝新式冷氣設備，不日即可完工，按滬上最大影院如南京國泰等之冷氣設備，均由約克承裝，成績昭著，人所共知。所以今年金城的　氣，能使觀衆滿意，是無　　的了，而全滬的影迷，也不必憂慮今年暑天沒有好的國產影片欣賞了。</p>

<h3>倉庫建築之設計</h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>近年來，全國的鐵路，提倡負責運輸的結果，農村的經濟，確確實實活潑了許多。最近各大輪船公司，如招商三北等，又實行了連運，這樣一來，全國貨物運輸，果然便利了許多，但是有許多時候，車輪缺乏，貨物不能運走，那麼貨物必定有一個儲存的地方，所以倉庫之建築，是最需要的了。從前我國的鐵路，貨運不大發達，以所食庫的建築，是很馬虎，就是長江各埠輪船的倉庫，也很簡陋，這些都應特別的改良，方能合乎需要，我現在把設的要點，來談一談罷。</p>
<p>（一）位置之選擇　倉庫分二種，一種是鐵道倉庫，一種是輪船倉庫，選擇位置的要點，就是交通便利，裝卸極易，所以倉庫之位置，必須建築於靠近鐵路河流或馬路之處，上海麥根路的貨棧，位置是很好的，前臨蘇州河，後靠鐵路，又與馬路相述，所以兩路貨運特別發達的了，倉庫普通離河道約十米到十五米，離貨站及馬路，都應在二十米以內，因爲愈近則愈省力及愈經濟了，倉庫的建築，不可大小，因爲太小了，不敷儲存貨物，太大了，建築費用一定很大，普通都是從目前需要着手，選擇位置的時候，一定要顧到日後的需要，所以地皮不妨大一點。</p>
<p>（二）建築要點　倉庫的大小，旣然隨貨運的多少而定，那麼牠的長度，最小爲五十米‘，最大爲一百米，他的寬度，普通都是十五米，如果一個倉庫不够，可以再建築幾個，有的是平行的，有的是並列的，有的是並列而又平行的，完全視地皮的大小和形狀而定，但是每一排相隔的距離，是少十五公尺，因爲火災的避免，是體當注意的，倉庫的式樣，平房的最多，二層三層的，是最少的了。</p>
<p>（三）材料的選擇　倉庫的要件，就是堅固，和無火災的危險，及雨水的侵蝕，所以材料的選擇，是最重要的了，普通用銅鐵去造，這是很好的，但是太貴了，鋼骨混凝土，此任何材料都好，建築的倉庫個不少，木料在中國是很貴的，同時又不堅固，又怕水火，切記不可用的。</p>
<p>（四）倉庫之設備　倉庫爲儲藏貨物之用，內部的設備，應該特別的完全，普通的倉庫，都有冷藏的設備，那麼水菓半奶牲食之類不致腐敗，第二個要緊的設備，就是防火，中　倉庫防火的設備極其馬虎，所以火災時有所聞，損失不可以數計，第三個設備，就是免去潮濕的侵蝕，如棉花農產物之類，受了潮濕，馬上腐朽，那麼負責運輸，就大受其害了，這些都是極緊要的問題，又是極微小的問題，設計土，不得不注意一下，中國運輸事業，方在萌芽時期。倉庫的建築同，必一天一天的增多，建築家來研究一下罷。</p>
<h3>新式建築上的燈光設計</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>「光綫」對於人身的重要，固己盡人皆知，牠可以操縱人們的健康，同時，牠能够影響工作的效率，一個光綫不充足的建築，根本失掉整個建築的價値。</p>
<p>「光綫」的來源，不外二種，就是日光，和燈光，建築上對於日光的設計，非常簡單，僅僅把建築的方向審愼的選擇一下，同時在建築上開放適當的窗洞面積，就可以得到很好的結果。但是燈光的設計，却沒有這樣簡單，牠對於建築內部的返射，顏色，和燈光的强度，都有很密切的關係，同時，對於人身精神上的刺激，和健康上的安慰，都有直接的影響，所以設計的時候，應當特別的加以考慮。</p>
<p>「燈光」設計最需要的條件，約可分下列幾端：</p>
<p>（一）光綫性質的適宜——某種的燈光對於指定的顏色有特別的返射光作用，使發光的效率增加，所以我們應當選擇一種適宜的燈光，用來滿足我們的目的</p>
<p>（二）避免炫光——炫耀的燈光，足以使人們的神經過分刺激，雙目昏眩，結果損壞健康。</p>
<p>（三）光綫分播的平均——平均的光綫分播，使整個室內光綫强度相等，返射平均，室內的東西，可以很容易的發現</p>
<p>（四）射影應當避免——射影足以使視綫阻礙，光綫暗淡，應當避免。</p>
<p>（五）適當的光度——在各個建築物內，因爲應用的目的不同，需要的光綫强度，也隨着變更，例如，會客室需要較强的光度，休息室需要溫柔一點的光度，臥室的光度，可以比較弱一點，這種的差別，設計時應當特別的注意。</p>
<p>（六）利用簡接射送光綫——把燈光直接射入眼簾，非但不能瞧到室內的東西，同時使眼瞳緊縮，損傷眼球，我們應當利用簡接的散佈光，要達到這個目的，可把燈光的距離，放置適當一點，同時，用毛玻璃的燈泡，或用適當的返射罩。</p>
<p>完美燈光設計的需要，已如上述，至於影響燈光的返射率，約可分下列幾個因素。</p>
<p>（甲）天花板的顏色</p>
<p>（乙）牆壁的顏色</p>
<p>（丙）房室的尺寸和形狀</p>
<p>天花板和牆壁的顏色，都直接影響燈光返射的强度，淺色的返射力較强，黯色的返射力較弱，擔試騐結果，各種顏色的返射光百分比，約可分下列幾種·（一）白色—九五·（二）淡紅—八〇·（三）淡黃—六五，（四）鵝黃—五六·（五）草綠—五〇，（六）黑色—一〇。</p>
<p>其中以白色的返射力最强，宜用於寫字間，打樣間，會客室等處、淡紅和鵝黃，最宜於臥室，能够得到極溫和的美威。</p>
<p>房間的大小和需要的支光都有關係，據試騐結果，各種建築上最適宜的「尺燭光」，（Foot　Candle）可如下述：</p>
<p>種類　尺燭光</p>
<p>閱書室　八—十二</p>
<p>打樣室　一五—二〇</p>
<p>寫字間　八—十二</p>
<p>臥室五　—六</p>
<p>休息室　八—一〇</p>
<p>商店橱窗　三〇—一〇〇</p>
<p>我們在設計燈光的前面，應當先分析房室的尺寸，內部的顏色，需要的目的，然後再去把適當的燈光配置，這樣所得的效果，一定是很美滿的。</p>
<h3>出席國際建築會議之范文照建築師最近造像</h3>
<p>范文照建築師奉內政部命，出席本年七月十五日在倫敦舉國之國際建築會議，業於前日乘加拿大皇后號放洋，范氏於十六日下午四時由新關碼頭出發登輪，其親友前往送行者數十人，聞此次出國，除參加上項會議及轉赴羅馬出席各國建築師所組織之國際建築會議外，並將順道考察歐洲各國之航空建築事業云。</p>
<p>（按）范氏爲我國建築界有數人物，畢業於美國本雪文尼大畢建築科，此間中國建築師學會發起人，曾任該會第一任會長，及首都設計委員會委員，首都中山陵園計劃專門委員兼常務委員，國民政府鐵道部技術專員等職。</p>
<h3>建築行話（十六）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>犯界——築場裏做的工作，不謬小得微細，或大得「邪氣」，處處地方要一步一步依照打樣鬼（詳前）劃的圖樣爲標準，决不可胡亂自作主意。不過有些地方，本來圖樣上的尺寸和地基的天位有時配合不攏，譬如本　圖樣上的一條弄堂的闊度是十二英尺。但在汰石灰（詳前）之後，因爲兩旁房屋地位的尺寸算準，對於弄堂的尺寸祇有十英尺或十一英尺，那末，圖樣和本來地基的尺寸分明不符合。責任當然在打樣鬼。　到這種地方就是犯界「生活」、犯界兩字也似扣壓扣衝斜（讀法詳前）一般成爲築塲裏的專門名詞。（其實是動詞）</p>
<p>馬路背——就是馬路中央，因爲馬路是兩面瀉水的，祇有馬路中央，（卽馬路背），和人行道的側石是一樣高度的，不過在房屋的基地做標準高度最好依側石比較靠得住。</p>
<p>釘送——舖樓板時除用鐵馬（詳前）將樓板排緊以後，對於樓板就用洋釘釘住。但洋釘須不透露在外表而。（因爲樓板舖好後，須經過刨的刨光）恐怕釘和刨接觸着，於是將釘用釘送送下去，它的形狀是一頭尖的和釘帽頭差不多大小。（待續）</p>
<h3>鋼鐵和木材建築的比較和將來的趨勢（上）</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>近年來因爲鋼鐵事業的發展，和鋼鐵本質的堅强，差不多大一點的建築，都大部分採用鋼鐵做建築材料，例如鋼骨水泥，和組合鋼骨等等，現在差不多很普遍，處現在這個鋼鐵的世界裏，我們從幾千年遺傳下來的木材建築學，顯然的有動搖的現象，據一般人的推測，不久的將來，這種木質建築，有希望被鋼鐵建築所徘斥，但是這種推測是絕對的錯誤，木材在建築上的用途，是絕對不會消減的，現在我們且把牠們的性質，略加分析，便可明瞭一切了。</p>
<p>木材所以被過去及現在一般人視爲重要建築材料的主要原因，約可分下列幾種：</p>
<p>（一）價格低廉——比較鋼或鐵廉數倍。</p>
<p>（二）質量很輕——比任何建築材料輕。</p>
<p>（三）運輸或搬運便利——因爲質輕的緣故。</p>
<p>（四）容易工作——可以鋸或切成任何形式。</p>
<p>從上面幾種優點看來，我們就可以推想到木材建築價格的低廉，輕便，和設計的便利，所以，一般的輕便和暫時的建築，木材實在是再適宜也沒有，并且，木材建築尙有一種最大的優點，就是振動的吸收，這點對於人們的安適，實在是很有關係的。</p>
<p>至於木材建築的缺點，當然是不能免的，下列幾種，大槪是最緊要的。</p>
<p>（一）容易着火——這是木材的本身問題。</p>
<p>（二）木材的瑕疵——差不多每一根本材，都有不能免的瑕疵，例如裂縫，織維不純等等——這種瑕疵，都足以妨害木材的本身，和整個建築强度。</p>

All princes and leaders attended and were able to openly discuss and centralize opinions on various administrative policies. The overall consensus was consistent. However, Mongolia is bound by the Qing Dynasty's policy of using religion to pacify the people, resulting in a low level of education. In addition, transportation is inconvenient, and the atmosphere is closed. In the future, the focus should be on developing transportation and promoting education. The meeting adjourned after the speech. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>The National Government held its Commemorative Week on the morning of the 17th. Deng Jiayan, Niu Yongjian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Chen Xunyong, Lin Xiang, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as 600 staff members from the various departments and committees of the National Government, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a report. He first explained in detail the Prime Minister's construction of psychological construction and the establishment of the theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" and the Prime Minister's saying, "The foundation of nation-building should originate from the psychology." He said that political integrity for two thousand years has relied on the maintenance of the psychology of those who were prescient and insightful. The saying "Government lies with the people" is certainly not to be changed. Second, he said that after the Prime Minister overthrew the corrupt politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty through revolutionary means, he saw the tyranny of warlords and the increasing suffering of the people. He felt that nation-building was difficult because of weak faith. Therefore, he declared "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" to the party members, clarifying that the strategy of nation-building is practical and not lofty and difficult to achieve. It only needs to be done step by step, and its effects will be seen. If confidence is not established, even a slight difficulty will lead to interruption, and it will not succeed. He again said that the two ancient sayings "Knowing is not difficult, doing is difficult" are from the false Shangshu of Mei Ze, which is originally unreliable. He also said that after the Prime Minister proved its falsehood with various events, it has become an iron case. The establishment of the theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" has increased people's courage. This is the teaching left to us by the Prime Minister. Furthermore, the Prime Minister believed that if the Chinese nation wants to survive in the world now, it must quickly seek construction. This responsibility is still borne by the intellectuals first. If the intellectuals know the path to construction, proceed without ceasing, and lead effectively, the masses will naturally follow. Therefore, it is said that they will also act unconsciously. Finally, he said that after the party and national government unified the country, the current situation has emerged after seven or eight years of hardship and danger. This is due to the psychology of our struggle. Now, all countries in the world are talking about maintaining peace on the one hand and trying their best to expand their armaments on the other. The situation is constantly changing, and it is difficult to observe. However, the ancients said, "Heaven does not stop its winter because of the evil cold of man, and earth does not stop its breadth because of the evil danger of man." We also cannot be intimidated by the difficult environment and the great difficulties of the future and lose our ambition. We should learn from the Prime Minister's spirit of sincerity, perseverance, and perseverance, hold fast to our principles, and take a self-strengthening psychology as the foundation of nation-building, so as not to be unworthy of his profound legacy.

<h3>Zhang Qilv Achieves Victory in Bandit Suppression in Northern Fujian: Captures Puppet Chairman Wen Shaoqing Alive</h3>
<p>Wen Shaoqing, the puppet regional chairman of Northern Fujian, and Huang Dao, the puppet secretary, led several hundred bandits, using the deep mountains at the intersection of Chong and Jian counties as their nest, and constantly harassing the area. Recently, Zhang Qilv's brigade dispatched Xu's regiment to suppress them. The bandits relied on the dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly, resulting in two days and nights of fierce fighting. Except for Huang Dao, who led a small number of remnants to escape to the Longzhongmen area in the northwest of Chong County, they were still pursued by our army and are currently being encircled. The puppet chairman Wen Shaoqing and more than ten puppet officers, including Qiu Jinshan, were captured alive. All the organs of the puppet headquarters were destroyed. 400 bandits were captured or killed, 300 refugees were rescued, and more than 100 rifles, one machine gun, and various medicines and false documents were seized. With this heavy blow to the remnants of the bandits in Northern Fujian, it will not be difficult to pacify the area. The provincial government received Zhang's victory report and immediately sent a telegram of commendation. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>What is Expected of the Annual Meetings of Various Academic Organizations</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>It is reported that the China Science Society will jointly hold its annual meeting with several natural science academic organizations in Wuzhou, Guangxi. The China Education Society will also jointly hold its annual meeting with academic organizations researching education in Beiping. This is truly a gratifying phenomenon. It is a pity that the initiation was too early this year. Some academic organizations with similar natures were unable to join these two major joint annual meetings held simultaneously in the North and South due to the urgency of time. I sincerely hope that when various domestic academic organizations hold their annual meetings this year, they will unanimously decide to hold joint meetings next year and immediately elect a preparatory committee to prepare early in order to achieve perfection. The location will be determined during a joint meeting of the preparatory committee. The nature will be temporarily divided into two major categories: one for natural sciences and one for social sciences.</p>
<p>Someone may ask why all academic organizations cannot jointly hold the annual meeting next year. Originally, it would be best if this could be done. However, firstly, there are too many people, and it may be difficult to choose a meeting venue. Secondly, interests differ, and it may be difficult to arrange a joint meeting agenda. I propose that the annual meeting next year be temporarily divided into the two major categories listed above. If the results of handling next year are not bad, then expansion may be considered again the year after. In the future, meetings will be held in two locations every odd year and merged into one every even year.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of holding joint annual meetings, there are many. First, various academic organizations of similar nature gather together. Not only are there many common and related issues that can be discussed with each other, but different issues can also be listened to in order to achieve the effect of mutual learning. Moreover, they can mutually receive spiritual encouragement and emotional unity. Its impact on the future of Chinese academia will be far-reaching.</p>
<p>Second, regarding travel issues, joint annual meetings have a large number of people. Round-trip travel can book an entire boat or several train cars. The cost is even lower than a half-price discounted ticket. Moreover, opinions can be exchanged in advance on the way and acquaintances made. After the meeting, discussions on unfinished matters can continue.</p>
<p>Third, the meeting location can be widespread, and local receptions are simpler. There are no less than ten or twenty annual meetings of national academic organizations every year. Holding meetings in different locations can be overwhelming for local receptions. Moreover, due to cost considerations, meetings have always been held mostly in provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast. Therefore, remote provinces hope that academic organizations will go to hold meetings, but going to the southeast ports is already tired of welcoming and sending off. If joint meetings can be held in the future, the meeting location can be popularized throughout the country, and local receptions will be easier to handle.</p>
<p>Fourth, it can be a prelude to the joint establishment of a Chinese academic society. Almost all countries in the world have national academic organizations. Although there are many Chinese academic organizations, there is not a single overall organization, which is a great regret. Now, joint annual meetings are held first. Once the time is ripe, a national academic society can be jointly established. In the future, division of labor and cooperation will contribute more to Chinese and world academia. Moreover, it can unite internally and be consistent externally, with many conveniences.</p>
<p>There are many other benefits of holding joint annual meetings. I will not go into details here. However, I further hope that when various academic organizations hold annual meetings in the future, academic discussions will be the main focus, and social activities and sightseeing will be secondary. In the past, many organizations often spent more than half of the total time on social activities and sightseeing in the annual meeting schedule, which defeats the original purpose of academic organizations holding annual meetings. I believe that sightseeing, if any, should be held after the annual meeting closes, and social activities should be limited to one joint public banquet by local agencies. Local agencies may as well save the remaining funds to hire experts to give public lectures after or before the meeting. This may not be without benefit to the promotion of academia.</p>
<p>Recently, domestic academic organizations have become increasingly developed, and the annual meeting issue has also become more important. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinion and correct it with various academic organizations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Advocates Strengthening Policies Towards Manchuria: Reports Inspection Results to Okada. Cabinet Council Holds Second Meeting Yesterday.</h3>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Hoare Announces Policy Towards China to the House of Commons: Close Attention Paid to Economic Conditions, Political Stability Shows Steady Progress, Hebei Issue Being Discussed by Telegram.</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Foreign Secretary Hoare gave a highly anticipated speech on the overall situation in China in the House of Commons today, saying that the impact of the world's economic misfortunes on China has been later than expected for various reasons. In recent months, China's economic situation has been indeed difficult, and its position has become even more chaotic due to the recent rise in silver prices. The government is closely and sympathetically paying attention to all developments. The House of Commons knows that it is now planned to send Sir Ross, the chief of the British government's economic advisors, to China as soon as possible so that he can contribute opinions to London on the country's current economic situation. Although China's finances have encountered difficulties in recent months, its political situation has not deteriorated, and there is a steady trend towards order and consolidation. The central government's suppression of the communists also has the appearance of expanding its authority and power. However, in the past two weeks, there have been disturbing developments in North China. The various details that have been reported are contradictory, and the situation is in danger of rapid change. Japanese military authorities have made demands on the Chinese authorities because Chinese people and groups have engaged in anti-Japanese activities within the demilitarized zone delineated by the Tanggu Truce Agreement. The Chinese authorities have taken steps to meet these demands, but some points remain unresolved and will be discussed locally. As for the recent developments in North China, he has been discussing them by telegram with the British representatives stationed in Tokyo and Nanjing, and the two representatives are contacting the governments of their respective host countries. This telegram discussion is still in progress. (17th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Scourge of Opium in North China: On-the-Spot Inspection by British Social Reformer: Who Is Making the Will of the Chinese People Decline?</h3>
<p>Miss Muriel Lester, a British social reformer, recently investigated the opium trade in the demilitarized zone of North China and exposed many things. A special correspondent from the Manchester Guardian in Beiping wrote an article to elaborate on this, which was published by the newspaper along with an editorial saying, "Japan bears a major responsibility for this." According to the correspondent, Miss Lester discovered as many as 116 Japanese people selling narcotics in Changli County, Hebei Province, and there were also 47 Koreans. Among them, 65 people had only resided in the area since the beginning of this year. The narcotics they sold were very cheap. Once they were caught, they all used extraterritoriality as a shield and were able to go unpunished. In Leting alone, a place with a population of only 30,000, there were as many as 200 narcotics shops set up by Japanese and Koreans. Workers in the mining areas of Tangshan and Guye were particularly severely affected by narcotics. According to reliable sources, there were as many as 550 narcotics shops opened in Tangshan City in the past twelve months. The Manchester Guardian then published a commentary based on these figures, saying, "The increasing addiction of Chinese people is appalling. Japan bears a major responsibility. There is a lot of powerful evidence to prove that the narcotics that Chinese people are addicted to are mostly transported from or through Japanese territories, and they are promoted in North China with the consent of Japanese officials. Any fair-minded observer who sees this situation cannot help but raise the following question: Since the Japanese army harbors ambitions for the provinces south of the Great Wall, is the open sale of these narcotics, which can make the will of the Chinese people decline and be unable to resist Japanese expansionism, being encouraged by the Japanese army?" (17th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Hoare replied to an inquiry in the House of Commons today about the "Manchukuo" oil monopoly, saying that after Britain protested against the monopoly, it did not receive a reply from Japan. At the same time, the monopoly has been implemented. In this environment, British and American oil merchants have no choice but to withdraw from the "Manchukuo" market. He heard that the withdrawal conditions will be discussed by the British and American oil companies with the "Manchukuo" authorities. The British government's views on this monopoly and the Japanese government's responsibility have been fully documented in the note of April 29. (17th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Arita: There is a Rumor that He Will Resign This Autumn: Shigemitsu Kui is Most Likely to Succeed Him.</h3>
<p>In order to prepare for the naval disarmament conference at the end of this year and to refresh the atmosphere within the ministry, Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to resolutely transfer the heads of the ministry this autumn. Japanese Ambassador to China Arita will go to China again after the embassy is upgraded, but he himself hopes to resign and retire from the diplomatic world in two or three months. Therefore, his successor will be selected from either Ambassador to Belgium Arita Hachiro or the current Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu Kui. Vice Minister Shigemitsu often has disagreements with the military and has formed a large force within the ministry, so he will inevitably be transferred to a foreign country. Therefore, the rumor that he will go to China to take up the post of ambassador is the most credible. Hori, the director of the Eurasian Bureau, will succeed as vice minister. The director of the New Zealand Consulate General will be appointed to succeed Hori. (17th, China United Telegram)</p>

Everything I have seen in the Soviet Union has exceeded my expectations.

This makes my usual policy of ensuring the friendship between the two countries even more consolidated."

<h3>Anglo-German Naval Negotiations: Italian Reply Sent to Britain.</h3>
<p>Today's newspapers reported in detail on the Anglo-German naval talks. The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer declared that when Ribbentrop spoke with Foreign Secretary Hoare last Friday, a basic agreement had been found, and the only unresolved issues were technical details in the agreement. The value of these talks lies mainly in determining how to conclude a broader agreement. No one in London believes that accepting Germany's proposal is a violation of the Treaty of Versailles, but it is not of great importance. The agreement passed by the Stresa Conference and confirmed in Geneva clearly assumes that Article V of the Treaty of Versailles has become invalid. For this reason, the British believe that the principles decided by the Stresa Conference do not conflict with the current Anglo-German naval understanding. The Times said that Britain's maritime hegemony is not as strong as it was during the war, but the political situation is quite favorable. What Germany is discussing now is the combat power of the two countries' fleets, which has become a usage rate. The two countries decide the combat power of their fleets based on each other's plans. It is very clear that Germany has no intention of fighting at sea in Europe. (16th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>According to predictions in newspapers here, the Anglo-German naval talks will soon lead to an agreement. The News Agency said that the Anglo-German talks are now proceeding on the basis of Germany's request for 35 percent. The Evening News claimed that, given the current situation, Britain has no objection to this, so it is highly possible that an agreement will be reached on this basis. The newspaper continued that Hitler has clearly acknowledged that the British navy should be superior to any other country except the United States. If other European countries want to expand their navies, Britain will inevitably expand accordingly, and Germany can also expand accordingly according to the British proportion. The only question now is whether this agreement can be concluded. The Daily Telegraph said that when the Anglo-German talks began, France felt deeply uneasy. At that time, MacDonald had not yet resigned, but since Hoare took over as Foreign Secretary, he has indicated that France has no need to worry and that the British government will not allow anything to happen that would frighten France. (16th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Britain recently sent notes to the governments of the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, requesting that the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles be amended to recognize that Germany's naval tonnage accounts for 35 percent of Britain's. Except for France, the United States, Japan, and Italy have replied separately. The United States and Japan have given affirmative replies. However, the reply from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini requested that it be studied before a detailed reply is given, but he believed that the German naval issue should be included in the general German armaments issue, discussed together, and should not be treated as a special issue and resolved separately. Although the French reply has not yet been received, judging from the French newspapers' tone, the French opinion is generally the same as that of Italy. British political figures were quite shocked to hear of Italy's proposal, believing that if the general German armaments issue is to be resolved and the amendment of the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles is to be legalized, it will inevitably take a long time. Even if France and Italy give detailed replies, an agreement may not be reached immediately. However, Britain and Germany can disregard the attitudes of France and Italy and conclude an agreement first to determine the naval shipbuilding procedures of the two countries. Afterwards, they should discuss the matter at length with France and Italy through diplomatic channels to seek a final solution. The British side hopes to hold verbal consultations with France to point out to France that Germany's naval shipbuilding procedures are not inconvenient and should not be overly concerned. It hopes that France will accept it first, and Italy will inevitably follow France to accept it. Therefore, after the British government receives the French reply this week, it will probably indicate that after the German naval representatives return to the country, it hopes that France will send a delegation of naval experts to Britain to hold verbal negotiations with Britain. (17th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>The British government consulted the Italian government last week on Germany's request that its naval tonnage should account for 35 percent of Britain's. It is generally believed that Italy has replied to this note, saying that Italy considers this issue to be extremely important and extremely complex. Therefore, the Italian government has to conduct a thorough study. The Italian government will immediately conduct a detailed study and then notify the British government of the results of the study. However, the Italian government believes that the determination of Germany's naval tonnage should be discussed within the scope of Germany's general armaments and should not be regarded as a special issue and resolved separately. As for Italy's naval needs and shipbuilding plans, they have been publicly stated more than once and there is no change at present. 17th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Retaining the Shell: US Recovery Administration Reorganized: President Appoints O'Neal as Acting Director, Three New Agencies Established, Layoffs Underway.</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an executive order today appointing O'Neal, Vice Chairman of the New York Guarantee Trust Company, as the acting director of the Recovery Administration, because former Director Lee Chibao resigned today to resume his law practice. President Roosevelt reorganized the Recovery Administration as needed and has now established (1) a Business Cooperation Department to assist various industries in maintaining automatic operating standards, (2) an Advisory Committee as an advisory body to the Recovery Administration, and (3) a Research Department to investigate the impact of industry regulations. The person in charge of the Business Cooperation Department is Conley, and the head of the Research Department is Marshall. President Roosevelt has instructed O'Neal, Conley, and Marshall to expedite the reduction of the original 5,000 employees of the Recovery Administration. President Roosevelt said in his order today that the amendment of the Recovery Act will be carried out as soon as possible to adjust the work of employees to suit the current limited scope. Future legislation is not hopeless, so the usual structure of the Recovery Administration should be maintained. Observers said that President Roosevelt's remarks implied that he intended to extend the term of the Recovery Administration and make the principles of the Recovery Act permanent when it expires on April 1 next year. (16th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today issued an order extending the outline of the original Recovery Act to April 1, 1936. At the same time, he reappointed O'Neal, Vice Chairman of the Guarantee Trust Company, as Director of the Recovery Administration, and Marshall as a member of the committee. The President also established a new Business Organization Department with Conley as its director. The department's responsibility is to assist businesses in planning self-regulation. Labor representative Bailey has been appointed Deputy Director of the Administration and a member of the Advisory Committee. Other members of the committee include Charles Edison, son of inventor Edison, Vice President of the Miners' Union Morley, and AFL-CIO member Green. When announcing the above changes, the President said that the layoff of employees in the Recovery Administration will be carried out gradually and indicated that he may soon ask Congress to pass some new laws to include those parts of the Recovery Act that are not yet comprehensive. At the same time, Congress is also trying to make this temporary measure of the Recovery Act more permanent. However, the government has no definite plan. It is generally believed that as long as there is still room for improvement in the Recovery Act, the overall structure of the Administration should ultimately be maintained.

<h3>Mexican President Receives Public Support: Embarks on Organizing Labor Government, New Cabinet List to be Released Soon, Troops Gather in Capital, Former President Flees.</h3>
<p>Mexico City Mexican President General Cárdenas today mobilized troops loyal to him to the capital, preparing to organize a labor government by extremely swift means. The list of new government personnel will be released tomorrow. Cárdenas's action is obviously the result of defeating former Mexican President and dictator General Calles. Since his term as president expired, Calles has retired to Cuernavaca near the capital. According to the latest news, he was threatened by the current president's military force and has quietly fled to another place. Currently, workers, students, and Catholics who support General Cárdenas are gathering in the streets, shouting slogans supporting Cárdenas and overthrowing Calles. It is heard that Calles issued a statement before leaving, saying that although he has criticisms of the current political situation, he has no intention of interfering. His tone seems to indicate that he will permanently leave political life. It is rumored that Calles will live in northern Mexico near California, USA in the coming days. (16th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Mexico City Mexico is now a one-party state, and its only political party is the National Revolutionary Party. Last November, General Cárdenas, a member of the party, took office as President and organized the National Revolutionary Party cabinet. Its domestic policy is quite left-leaning, deeply protecting the interests of labor unions, and imposing various restrictions on the power of the Catholic Church. Therefore, it was dissatisfied with former President Calles, an important figure in Mexican politics. Calles has had disagreements with the current president for a long time. Recently, Gil, chairman of the National Executive Committee of the National Revolutionary Party, vowed to obey Calles's opinions. Therefore, the cabinet organized by President Cárdenas submitted its resignation on the 15th of this month. The cabinet is currently being organized, but the left and right factions are taking the opportunity to demonstrate and attack each other. The major labor unions of the left wing have organized a National Proletarian Defense Committee, preparing to form a labor united front to deal with various threats to restrict labor rights. The Catholic Church of the right wing convened a general meeting today, gave speeches, protested against the government's destruction of religious undertakings, and marched and demonstrated in the major avenues of the capital, with about 10,000 participants, but the police did not interfere.

<h3>Central Bank Governors of Various Countries Discuss Currency Issues; Believe Currency Stabilization is Not Yet Timely; French Representative Describes Financial Panic Situation</h3>
<p>Capital of Switzerland Central bank governors from various countries held a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements to discuss guaranteeing currency issues. They all agreed that the gold standard group of countries had won the victory in the struggle with speculators. Persons close to the central bank governors of various countries expressed doubt about the proposal of U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to convene an international monetary conference, believing that Britain would not be willing to consider truly stabilizing the currency before the parliamentary re-election. As for the implementation of currency stabilization, it only requires an understanding between the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and if necessary, the addition of Japan will be sufficient. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland During the meeting of the central bank governors of various countries, the Governor of the Bank of France, Mr. Tanary, described the recent currency panic in France, stating: "The traditional policy of the Bank of France is to maintain absolute freedom of gold circulation. Therefore, in normal times, even if the outflow of cash is very large, the Bank of France will never raise the discount rate. However, the situation is different if gold flows out specifically for speculative trading. The currency panic in France began at the end of March this year. At that time, the Bank of France did not take any defensive measures because the outflow of gold was not large at that time, and it was also the time when the Central Bank of the Netherlands raised the discount rate. France did not want to raise the discount rate at the same time to offset its effect. Subsequently, from April to the first week of May, the average daily outflow of gold did not exceed 60 million francs. However, in the second week of May, the daily outflow of gold reached 85 million francs. In the third week, the daily outflow of gold suddenly increased to 500 million francs, and in the fourth week, it was almost 1 billion francs. In total, from May 4 to June 7, the outflow of cash from France reached 9.9 billion francs, of which about half was shipped to the United States. As a result, a credit panic occurred in France. Speculators rushed to close positions and absorb cash, and the premium on cash rose to as high as 6.8% per annum. At this time, the Bank of France had to take action. The first step was to raise the discount rate from 2.5% to 6% from May 23 to 28. The second step was to strictly monitor exchange transactions to ensure the free flow of gold. In this regard, the U.S. Treasury Department provided a lot of assistance, because at that time, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau often sold U.S. dollars in the market to avoid the dangerous consequences of stopping the purchase of gold. The third step was to strictly limit bank lending. The Bank of England also assisted the policies of the Bank of France. Despite various restrictions, the bills held by the Bank of France increased from 40 billion francs to 80 billion francs in one month. From May 10 to June 7, gold reserves decreased by 9 billion francs, discount bills increased by 5 billion francs, and various accounts receivable decreased by 4 billion francs, of which current accounts decreased by 3.5 billion francs, and the amount of banknotes in circulation decreased by 500 million francs. The large reduction in current accounts was obviously due to the tightening of the currency market. Technically speaking, most of it was the result of speculative closing of positions. In addition, government budget deficits, treasury difficulties, and general publicity advocating the devaluation of currency were also one of the reasons. As for the present, the government has obtained full power to make up for the budget deficit and restore public credit. The government has now decided on various preliminary measures, which will be officially announced soon. Both the government and the Bank of France have the firm will to maintain the normal operation of the gold standard. The French government is working hard to prepare to restore economic balance through the path of stabilizing currency prices to restore international trade. We sincerely hope that it will be successful soon," and so on. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Li Zhonggong Telegraphed the Sichuan Salt Transport Envoy to Discuss the Reorganization of the Sichuan-Guizhou Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Guiyang Li Zhonggong, the Director of the Department of Finance, telegraphed Liu, the Sichuan Salt Transport Envoy, to discuss the reorganization of the Sichuan-Guizhou salt tax revenue, the abolition of the lead salt system, and the restoration of the co-funding regulations. The telegram stated: (1) Sichuan and Guizhou should cooperate to restore the co-funding, but it should be done in accordance with the chapters and regulations, with officials supervising merchants selling and taxing on the spot. The salt has a fixed price, and the merchants have a fixed line. It is the fundamental way to completely eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the Sichuan-Guizhou salt gang's business. (2) Salt is the main source of revenue for Guizhou Province, except for special goods. However, the revenue from special goods is bound to decrease gradually to zero due to the strict phased ban on opium. Afterwards, all government expenses will rely on the salt fund. Now that the Sichuan salt tax has been transferred to the central government, it will definitely provide overall subsidies to the cooperating provinces in Guizhou. It is planned to temporarily use 1.5 million as the standard for the recognized amount on the four banks of Rengong Fuyong, with an additional 50 cents for each package of salt affairs expenses, which totals 180,000 taels per year, totaling 1.68 million yuan. If it can be handled, the central and local governments can take care of it at the same time. (3) After the salt tax is taken over by the central government, the salt sold in Sichuan and Guizhou will not be taxed twice. (4) In the future, the salt sold in Guizhou should abolish the provincial organization, so that there is a glimmer of hope. (5) If the above five points are accepted, a location and time will be agreed upon to come to negotiate in person. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<h3>The Peace in Peiping is As Always</h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence The Sino-Japanese negotiations have shifted from the Hebei issue to the Zhangbei incident. However, due to the southbound journey of Acting Chairman He Yingqin, the talks have been temporarily suspended. Japanese planes often fly over Peiping to inspect the transfer of troops. There are no problems with the security of Peiping. Recently, it has been peaceful as always. Yin Rugeng went to Gubeikou on the 15th to inspect and will return to Peiping soon. The situation of each party is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation in Peiping</p>
<p>Since Acting Chairman He replied to the Japanese request, the people's hearts in Peiping have been at peace. The Xidan Shopping Mall, Dong'an Market, Zhongshan Park, Beihai Park, and Shichahai areas have returned to a lively state. Although Japanese planes often come to Peiping, there is no action, so the citizens are still calm. After the City Party Department was abolished, the mass organizations automatically disbanded invisibly, and there were no gatherings for meetings. There are very few slogans in the alleys and roads. The New Life badges on the arms of the police are not worn uniformly. However, the New Life slogans are still hung high on the archway near the former Presidential Palace. All schools are holding academic year exams, and students are taking the exams with peace of mind. There is no organization of the student council, and even the alumni associations of various schools have no meetings.</p>
<p>Yuan Liang's Talk</p>
<p>Peiping Mayor Yuan Liang told reporters that Acting Chairman He had left Peiping for Beijing on the morning of the 13th to report to the central government on the diplomatic issues in Hebei. The daily affairs of the Military Branch were handled by Bao Wenwei, the director of the office. The security of Peiping is my responsibility, so of course, I am responsible for maintaining it, and there is absolutely no problem. However, recently, I often hear rumors that incite people's hearts, most of which are unrealistic and whimsical. If the citizens do not observe, most of them will be shaken by them, which is really a meddling of fools. I hope that the press will dispel and make rational judgments on this at any time, so that citizens will not be used and seek trouble for themselves when rumors come. Moreover, the security of Peiping is jointly maintained by the military, police, and constitution. The daily precautions are very meticulous. Although Acting Chairman He has left Peiping, the security of Peiping will not be affected in any way. In the future, anyone who harms public peace and order will be severely punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Yin Goes to Gubeikou</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, the Commissioner of Jidong, left Peiping by car for Gubeikou at 6:00 am on the 15th to inspect the recent situation in the Jidong area, accompanied by Zhang Qinglin, the captain of the first special police team, and Inoue, a Japanese advisor. After arriving at noon, he met with the commander of the Gubeikou Brigade, Mr. Ishikawa, and the captain of Ishii's unit, and gave instructions to Huo Shi and others, the director of the Gubeikou Office. He returned to Miyun that evening and will go to Huairou Zunhua counties tomorrow (16th) to inspect. After a slight delay along the way, he will return to Peiping.</p>
<p>Chaiyama Arrives in Peiping</p>
<p>Former Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Chaiyama Kenshiro (the predecessor of Takahashi) arrived in Peiping from Tianjin on the sixth train of the Beining Road at 11:05 am on the 15th. According to Chaiyama, he came to Peiping this time without any mission. Because he had just returned from a tour of Europe, he disembarked in Tianjin and took the opportunity to come to Peiping to visit friends from all sides. He will stay for three or four days before going to Shanghai to take a ship back to China. Because he has not been in Peiping for a long time, he does not know much about the current problems between China and Japan and has no opinion to express.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly</p>
<p>Japanese military plane No. 23 flew from Chengde to Peiping on the 14th. At 6:00 am on the 15th, it was flown back to Chengde by the pilot Tanaka Seijyo. At about 9:00, a Japanese plane flew north from Changxindian on the Pinghan Line, circling over Xiyuan and Nanyuan several times for about ten minutes, and then flew southwest. It is reported that it was inspecting the situation of the Central Army opening south along the Pinghan Line. (15th)</p>
<h3>Brightness Bank Liquidation in Progress; Ministry of Finance Commissioner Arrives in Qingdao; Shanghai and Tianjin Branches' Debts Owed to Qingdao to Be Investigated and Reported to the Ministry for Approval</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: After the Minghua Bank ceased operations, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance to dispatch a commissioner to Qingdao to expedite the liquidation of the bank's debts. The Ministry of Finance granted his request and specially appointed Commissioner Qiu Zhenglun, who arrived in Qingdao by plane on the 13th from Shanghai to supervise the liquidation. Mayor Shen hosted a banquet for Mr. Qiu at the Yingbin (Guest Reception) Hotel on the evening of the 14th, inviting representatives from the city's Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, Liquidation Committee, and creditors to accompany him. During the banquet, they discussed the implementation plan. Mayor Shen briefly reported on the city government's handling of the situation after Minghua's closure and finally expressed three hopes for Commissioner Qiu's resolute leadership: (1) Expedite the liquidation process. At the beginning of Minghua's closure, there were originally two methods for handling the issue, either through court-led liquidation according to law or under the direction of the responsible Ministry of Finance. At that time, the city government convened discussions with court lawyers and creditor representatives, all of whom believed that court proceedings would involve extremely cumbersome liquidation and registration procedures, likely prolonging the process. Many creditors are poor and unable to wait. They hoped for administrative processing for speed, so a special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting its leadership. Local agencies and legal entities organized a liquidation committee to first ascertain the details of the bank's assets and liabilities, to serve as a reference when the Ministry of Finance's official liquidation committee is established. This time, the Commissioner is ordered to supervise the liquidation. All procedures should be expedited to complete the task within the time limit stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, to satisfy the eager expectations of all creditors. (2) Make every effort to recover the large sums of cash owed to the Qingdao branch by the Shanghai, Tianjin, and other branches, as well as the negotiable securities transported to Shanghai, to compensate the city's debts. According to the Liquidation Committee's report on Minghua's business situation in the city, it was originally profitable. However, due to the Shanghai, Tianjin, and other branches misappropriating 1.8 million yuan in large sums of cash and transporting negotiable securities worth approximately 200,000 yuan to Shanghai, the assets and liabilities became significantly imbalanced. This money originally belonged to the Qingdao branch. If it is not recovered and used to compensate Qingdao depositors, fairness will not be served. Recently, there have been rumors that the Beijing branch will repay debts at 70% of their value. If this news is confirmed, it would be equivalent to using Qingdao deposits to repay debts elsewhere, which is illogical and unfair. It is hoped that the Honorable Commissioner will thoroughly investigate the misappropriation of Qingdao branch funds by the Shanghai, Tianjin, and other branches, and make every effort to recover the negotiable securities transported to Shanghai, to meet the needs of repaying the city's debts. (3) It is hoped that the existing assets of the Qingdao branch will be quickly converted into cash to repay a portion of the debts first. The bank's depositors, numbering nearly 10,000, mostly consist of poor city residents, or the elderly and weak women, who rely on this for their livelihoods. Once their livelihoods are cut off, it could lead to major social problems. It is hoped that the Honorable Commissioner will be mindful of the people's hardships and quickly find ways to liquidate the bank's assets in Qingdao, so that a portion of the debt can be repaid as soon as possible to reassure the public," and so on. After Shen's report, Commissioner Qiu rose to give a speech, briefly stating that Minghua's closure was undertaken by the municipal government, instructing the Social Affairs Bureau to seal the books together with local groups, and organizing a Liquidation Committee to ascertain the bank's asset and liability situation, so that he would have a basis upon arrival, and he was most grateful. Before leaving Shanghai, he had consulted the Minister and Deputy Minister for policy guidelines. He was ordered to come to Qingdao as soon as possible to supervise the liquidation in accordance with the Ministry's recently established six-point liquidation method. Once the liquidation shows some progress, he will report to the Ministry for further instructions. The three points raised by Mayor Shen are extremely important. He respectfully presents his humble opinions below: (1) Mayor Shen hopes for swift progress, and he greatly sympathizes with this view. As soon as the Liquidation Committee is organized and established, it will begin work diligently. (2) The internal affairs of Minghua, as well as the debt situations of the Shanghai, Tianjin, and other branches, will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval after the Liquidation Committee has thoroughly and clearly investigated the entire situation of assets and debts. (3) How to dispose of Minghua's assets in Qingdao will be decided by the Liquidation Committee after it has approved a plan, and he will then request instructions from the Ministry of Finance and follow them accordingly," and so on.

The West route is located in the upstream counties of northern Fujian, the North route refers to the areas from Fuzhou's Northern Ridge to Funing Prefecture, and the South route is centered on Anxi. Black tea is best from the West route, followed by the North route. Green tea is more common in the North route and less common in the West route. Oolong tea, also known as Yan tea, is best produced in Wuyi, followed by Jian'ou and other places. White tea, also known as Baihao, is superior when produced in Funing Prefecture. In the South route, Tieguanyin is famous, with the best quality coming from Anxi. Before 1916, exports averaged about 10 million yuan per year. From 1916 to 1928, it was a period of decline, with exports only exceeding 6 million yuan. From 1929 to 1931, it reached 20 million yuan annually, which can be considered a prosperous period. In the last three years, the tea regions have been occupied by bandits, the people are not living in peace, production has declined daily, and it has presented a declining phenomenon. The average annual amount is only 90,000 dan, with a value of no more than several million yuan. Currently, in order to promote the tea industry in the North route (Funing Prefecture), the Construction Bureau has established a tea warehouse near the fourth pier in Taijiang, Fuzhou. The purposes are: (1) To inspect counterfeit and wet tea. Mountain households use wet tea to increase weight, suppressing prices. Tea firms, in order to rush to the market, mix un-dried tea and transport it to the province, resulting in moldy tea leaves. (2) To inspect the boxed tea packaged for transport to the province. If the box boards are too thin, they will break during transit. If transporting over long distances, it is particularly unusable and must be improved in the future. (3) To inspect and verify the packaging weight. The weight of packaged black tea is not consistent. Even under the same brand, there are differences in weight. Foreign firms, when weighing, choose the lightest as the standard, causing tea merchants to suffer losses. The weight of green tea packaged in bags is also inconsistent. Even under the same brand, there are often differences of several catties. When selling and weighing, handlers can profit from it. (4) To chemically test tea samples. Small quantities of various tea samples are sent to the Science Museum for chemical testing, comparing them with the standard tea set by the Ministry of Industry. (5) To compile tea industry statistics. The types, quantities, and prices of tea transported to the province from various counties under Funing Prefecture will be compiled. (6) To prevent tea theft. In the past, due to the lack of tea warehouse facilities, all tea shipments were transported by ships to Fuzhou, unloaded and stored in foreign go-downs, transferred to small boats, and theft from the boats was common. Tea was sold at low prices to tea shops. Boxed tea was sometimes opened with thin knives, and lead sheets were inserted, damaging the contents. (7) To avoid damage from wind and rain. The tarpaulins on foreign go-downs and small boats were not tightly sealed. When encountering wind and rain, the tea leaves would get wet. In the event of floods, the danger was even greater. Now, with on-site warehousing, this concern can be avoided. The warehouse rent charged is extremely low. This is the first step in the plan. The second step is to establish an agricultural experiment station in Fu'an, under Funing Prefecture, specializing in research on tea leaves and other products. It has been discussed with the Education Bureau to convert the county middle school in that county into a provincial vocational middle school, offering tea industry courses. The Bureau will also work with the Second District Commissioner's Office to establish an iron factory in the county, engaged in manufacturing various agricultural tools. The proposed location for the agricultural experiment station is Shekou, and the vocational middle school will also be moved there. Shekou is a tea-producing area for Fuding, Shouning, and other counties and can serve as a model for future merchants. Once instructions are received from the provincial government, it can be realized. (June 15th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Prevents Communist Bandits: Labor Institution Captures Communist Propagandists; Headquarters Restores Intelligence Team and Postal Inspection</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to the recent economic downturn in Guangzhou, the number of unemployed people is increasing daily, and the society is generally depressed. Communist bandits are taking advantage of the idleness of the unemployed and laborers, secretly sending party members to infiltrate urban areas, promoting communism to the unemployed and working classes, or distributing reactionary printed materials, engaging in large-scale activities. Recently, public security agencies have cracked down on many such cases. At the end of last month, at the Second Labor Collection Center near Haizhu Iron Bridge in Changdi, a person suddenly entered the center in the evening to seek lodging. After socializing with the coolie workers inside for a while, he used his manipulative tactics, tempting them with small benefits, then promoted communism, inciting the workers to join. The impoverished were tempted by his money, and one or two were deceived. Later, someone who understood the situation reported to the manager of the center, who arrested the communist bandit, seized evidence and more than 100 yuan in cash, and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau along with the witnesses for strict interrogation. The bandit initially denied it, but later confessed and revealed the locations of several communist organizations. The bandit confessed that his surname was Yao, his name was Sheng, he was 23 years old, and he was from Lizhou County. According to the report, police detectives searched for the remaining members of the gang and arrested many people that day. At the same time, military and political agencies recently received intelligence that communist bandits have recently organized propaganda teams composed of men and women, young and old, to promote communism, and there is also a so-called youth female espionage group, composed of young women, who are skilled at socializing, using their charm to seduce people, infiltrating the military and political circles, making friends with high-ranking military and political leaders, with the aim of gathering military secrets and political intelligence, and buying off disgruntled people for their own use. After receiving the report, the authorities issued orders to all subordinate agencies to take strict precautions, and ordered the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to purchase more informants and intensify investigations. Previously, the Headquarters had a political intelligence team, which was abolished due to government downsizing. However, recently, in order to prevent the spread of communist bandits, the Headquarters has established an intelligence team of dozens of members, led by a captain, directly under the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, specializing in investigating and arresting communist bandits and reactionary elements. Regarding transportation, postal inspection has recently been restored. Suspicious letters are intercepted and inspected before being allowed to be delivered. The Headquarters dispatched four lieutenant officers yesterday to be stationed permanently at the Guangdong Postal Administration to carry out the duty of inspecting mail. (June 12th)</p>
<h3>Overview of Guangdong Railways: Business on Each Line is Not What it Used to Be; Zhushao Road Constructed to Luojiadu</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, with the collapse of the social economy, not only is business declining, but also transportation agencies are experiencing a sharp decline in revenue. Therefore, railway bureaus are introducing reforms to both management and business. An overview of each line is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong-Kowloon Railway: This railway, from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, is jointly operated by China and Britain, divided into Chinese and British sections. After the revision of the railway agreement last year, it was hoped that the railway business would develop. However, in reality, it has presented a bleak picture. The main reasons are: 1. In the past year, business in Hong Kong has plummeted, and the volume of passengers and goods has greatly decreased. 2. There are several day and night ferries between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, which are constantly traveling. Moreover, these Guangzhou-Hong Kong ferries have greatly reduced fares in the past month. Foreign shipping companies are selling passenger tickets for as low as one to three dimes. As a result, the lower classes traveling between Hong Kong and Guangdong are mostly choosing boats over land. The Guangdong-Kowloon Railway is affected by this and has no choice but to sell tickets at a lower price to compete. Its operating revenue has therefore sharply decreased. Currently, the railway's daily revenue is only over 3,000 yuan, which is over 1,000 yuan less than before. In order to remedy this, the railway is planning to expand freight transport, with the Traffic Department responsible for preparations. In order to meet social demands, it plans to charge low freight rates to attract more business.</p>
<p>Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway: This railway, formerly known as the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, is actually the southernmost section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. It was the first to be opened, with the route from Guangzhou to Shaoguan, passing through various counties along the North River. In the past, freight transport was the main source of revenue, such as cattle, timber, stone mines, firewood, rice, salt, etc. However, due to repeated natural disasters in the rural areas along the North River, people's livelihoods are extremely strained, and production along the route has greatly decreased. The remaining products are transported by waterways, which are cheaper. As a result, very few goods are transported by train. Secondly, the Guangdong salt industry relies on the North River as a hub, with its major sales markets in southern Hunan. Recently, Guangdong salt in southern Hunan has been taken over by Huai salt, resulting in a sharp decline in the volume of salt transported by train. The railway has therefore lost a major source of revenue. In summary, due to various reasons, the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway's business is declining daily. Therefore, there are talks of reorganization. It is heard that the reorganization method will start with downsizing to balance revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway: Originally a branch line of the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the route is from Guangzhou to Sanshui, passing through Nanhai, Foshan, and Sanshui. In its heyday, it was the most profitable railway in China, because the route was short and the fares were high. However, recently, it also has sighed at the difference between the past and the present. The fundamental impact is due to the decline of industry and the bankruptcy of rural areas in Nanhai and Foshan. In addition, the development of other</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>water and land transportation means that the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway is no longer a monopoly. Since the Jiangmen-Foshan Highway was built, long-distance buses can be taken from Foshan to Jiangmen. At the same time, the number of private ferries from Guangzhou to Foshan is increasing daily, with low fares, only one-third of the Guangzhou-Sanshui train fare. With the people impoverished and resources exhausted, and with tight household budgets, it is inevitable that travelers will choose water transportation. Therefore, the Guangzhou-Sanshui train is also planning to reduce fares to compete with the ferries. Recently, fourth-class cars have been added, charging the lowest fares. Normally, the minimum fare from Guangzhou to Sanshui is 30 cents, but now it is only 15 cents. However, there is still little improvement. The Bureau is currently trying to find ways to remedy this.</p>
<p>Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway: This railway, from Shaoguan in Guangdong to Zhuzhou in Hunan, is the Guangdong-Hunan border section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and has not yet been fully opened. The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau has been established to oversee the construction project. However, the Guangdong-Hunan border is a region of high mountains and ridges, requiring tunnels, making the project large-scale. Currently, the section from Shaoguan to Lechang has been opened. Recently, the track laying project from Lechang Qimen to Luojiapu Station has also been completed, and a trial run can be conducted on the 15th of this month. According to the investigation, the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, from Shaoguan to Zhuzhou, is divided into 32 stations. Construction of each station is underway, and the names of each station have also been determined as follows: Shaoguan Station, Libutou Station, Yangxi Station, (the word "Station" is omitted below) Lechang, Qimen, Luojiadu, Jinjiling, Baishidu, Taipingli, Dengjiatang, Xiawan, Liuchuan, Xujiadong, Qifengdu, Gaotingsi, Liupingxu, Xiaoshuipo, Leiyang, Zheqiao, Wayuan, Guanyinqiao, Dongyangdu, Hengzhou, Dabao, Xiasi, Hengshan, Shangwan, Zhuting, Gantian, Zhaoling, Sanmen, Zhuzhou.

<h3>Qufu: Yansheng Duke's Mansion Must Be Protected; Executive Yuan Sends Letter to Shandong Provincial Government for Detailed Plans; Provincial Government Has Assigned to Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus for Review</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qufu is the birthplace of Confucius and the final resting place of his body. To this day, the mausoleum and temple stand majestically, the descendants of the lineage reside there, and the traces of the sage are numerous. They are closely related to our country's history and culture and should be cherished and protected. Therefore, by tradition, special protection is ordered. Since the central government issued an order granting Kong Decheng, the 76th generation descendant of the direct line, the title of Sacrificial Official, the name of the Yansheng Duke's Mansion has not yet been changed. As for the maintenance of security in the holy land and the preservation of cultural relics in the Temple of Confucius, these are the urgent tasks at present. In view of this, the central government, through the Ministry of Interior, has presented various measures on correcting the name of the Yansheng Duke's Mansion and establishing police organs, and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan believes that the province has many old cases to investigate and should be handed over to the provincial government for planning. Therefore, it specially sent a letter to the provincial government requesting detailed plans and replies. After receiving the letter, the provincial government submitted it to the provincial government affairs meeting on the 14th for discussion, resolving to assign it to the Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus for review and reply. The Executive Yuan's official letter stated: "Having received the Premier's order, we have reviewed the Ministry of Interior's presentation on correcting the name of the Yansheng Duke's Mansion, establishing police organs, maintaining security in the holy land, and preserving the cultural relics of the Temple of Confucius, requesting instructions. It should be investigated whether the security within the official residence includes the forest and temple, and according to the organizational outline of the police bureaus at all levels, the police organs should be established. Whether the organs should be established within the official residence has been referred to the Ministry of Interior for investigation and reply. Now, according to the Ministry's reply to the above points, it should be handed over to the Shandong Provincial Government for detailed plans and replies," and so on. (14th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Convenes Henan River Engineering Conference; Eight Hazardous Projects to Be Repaired Immediately, Working Day and Night</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Kong Xiangrong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council's Water Conservancy Committee and Deputy Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, was ordered to inspect the emergency defense projects for the aftermath of the Yellow River in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces. A few days ago, he rushed to the Wen, Yu, Zhongrong, Qin, and Chenqiao areas in Henan Province, examining the dangerous sections of the valley embankment one by one, inspecting them in detail, and deciding to immediately go to Hebei and Shandong provinces to continue the inspection and investigate the issue of guiding the Yellow River entrance. It has been reported in detail in various newspapers. It is now learned that after inspecting the various inspection projects in Henan Province, Mr. Kong deeply felt that with the imminent flood, it was necessary to actively concentrate, unite, and confer in order to expedite progress. On the morning of the 10th of this month, at 10 a.m., he invited relevant agencies to hold a meeting at the Relief Work Group in Bian. Those present included Fang Qidao, Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Government, Wei Xigeng, Representative Secretary, Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Construction Bureau, Yin Renxian, Director of the Finance Bureau, Dong Zhaolin, Chairman of the Henan Yellow River Qinhuai Work Material Collection Committee, Chen Ruzhen, Director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Wang Yujun, Secretary of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and Chief Engineer Fu Pucheng.

<h3>Songjiang: Jinshanwei Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>Regarding the robbery of several families, including the Qi family in Jinshanwei, Panan, Fan Zhicheng, leader of the third squad of the first district of the waterborne Provincial Public Security Team, after visiting and arresting, thought that Shen Xiaogen, Sheng Dinaliu, and Gu Aimei were suspicious. All three were taken back to the department. According to interrogation, they did not hesitate to confess to the robbery. They immediately prepared documents and transferred them to the county government to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Bureau Sends Patrol Ships to Cruise Waterways</h3>
<p>The areas of Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian and Qingpu counties have repeatedly experienced theft cases, and the waterways are particularly important. The Civil Affairs Bureau has specially appointed Hong Ping patrol ship captain Wang Daohuang to lead the ship to cruise the various places to maintain local peace. After receiving the order, Wang followed it accordingly and established an office in Minhang.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Jiaxiang Ferryboat Has Been Suspended for Four Days</h3>
<p>The Jiaxiang ferryboat stopped running on the 14th after the Nanxiang Public Security Sub-bureau arrested crew members. Chen Youmin, Director of the County Public Security Bureau, asked Jin Boqin, Chairman of the ferry company's board of directors, to persuade the employees to resume operations. Zhou Gongli, an executive member of the county party headquarters, also separately mediated, but there has been no result. It has been the fourth day now. Jiaxiang transportation has been interrupted, and joint Beijing-Shanghai train and Shanghai-Jiading tickets have also been temporarily suspended. Travelers are greatly inconvenienced. The company has submitted a document requesting the county government to punish the responsible personnel and has sent letters to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration and the County Chamber of Commerce for assistance. According to the situation, the County Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the county government on the 16th to dismiss Zheng Qi, Director of the Public Security Sub-bureau, and his secretary, and to punish Wu Jiaqi, the police cadet involved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Zhenru Murder Case Appeals Hearing</h3>
<p>The case of Zhou Pingyuan, director of the Shanghai Zhenru Police Station, and Xing Guonong, an employee, being accused of using torture to force confessions and causing a person's death, was judged by the Shanghai Court. Zhou Xie were each sentenced to ten years in prison. Zhou and Xing did not accept the original sentence and appealed to the High Court. The High Court summoned witnesses and all relevant parties yesterday (17th) at 2 p.m., and brought up Zhou and Xing, the two appellants. The presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division opened the trial. The judge said that the case was complicated and still needed investigation, and ordered Zhou and Xing to be returned to custody to await further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Eastern Tai Lake Migrant People Run Rampant</h3>
<p>There are a total of five or six thousand migrants in the Eastern Tai Lake who are enclosing lake fields. A portion of the migrants from the Kainand Company have been provided with funds by the company and dispersed. However, after receiving the funds, the migrants did not return to their native Shandong, but remained around Tai Lake and other places, running rampant, stealing items from farmers. Because of their large number, the villagers fear them like tigers. Jin Jian, the head of the district, in addition to requesting the security team to send a team to strictly guard against them, especially visited County Magistrate Wu yesterday (17th) to request that the farmers be effectively protected and that methods be found to expel the migrants from the country. County Magistrate Wu immediately ordered Nie Daidui, the head of the security team, to investigate and deal with the matter strictly.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Chamber of Commerce Discusses Business Tax Issues</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various industries on the afternoon of the 16th to discuss business tax issues. More than 90 people attended. Yu Yiqin was publicly elected chairman. Items for discussion included: (1) How should we respond to the notification from the Business Tax Bureau to submit the 24th year report within a limited time? It was resolved that the tax amounts in the notification are mostly inconsistent with the facts, and the following points of doubt should be raised to the Business Tax Bureau for auditing: (A) The various industries that are taxed according to capital amount have increased by more than ten times, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. (B) Various industries’ credit collateral loans are temporary activities in this economically difficult period and cannot be used as fixed capital. (C) This audit mistakenly included various tax-exempt goods within the scope of taxation. (D) This audit mostly used the seasonal income and busy months as the standard for the whole year's taxation. The above points should be addressed by the Chamber in a letter to the Business Tax Bureau for correction. (2) With the business of various industries declining, is it necessary to elect representatives to state the difficulties to the Business Tax Bureau and request a reduction in the tax amount in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties? It was resolved to publicly elect Wan Xiangyao, Cha Binchu, Tan Xianglin, Jiang Panfa, Lin Qiaobao, Yu Yiqin, Gao Yongni, Cao Rongzu, Zhou Jingsheng, and Shi Rubing to petition the Business Tax Bureau.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Compromise Method Decided for Wheat Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to promote the purchase and use of domestic wheat and improve its quality, the Shanghai Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association specially jointly organized a Wheat Research Association to engage in research and improvement, and to inspect goods and prevent the addition of ash and impurities. Previously, the Association sent Ge Jixian, general manager, and Gu Leshan, an employee, to Wuxi to contact flour mills and rice merchants to promote the organization. Yesterday, Ge came to Wuxi from Shanghai together with Wang Yaochen, a Shanghai flour tycoon and a native of Wuxi, to negotiate with Rong Desheng, Cai Jiansan, Zhao Zixin, Zheng Yunxiang, Chen Hongyuan, etc. again. As a result, the expenses of the Wuxi Wheat Research Association will be advanced by the Shanghai Association as a trial. The original proposal of the flour mills paying an annual membership fee of 200 yuan and charging merchants one cent per dan will not be collected for the time being. Regarding the issue of wheat inspection, because experts are afraid of causing misunderstandings among merchants and causing disputes, a compromise method was adopted. It was decided that the goods stored in the factory's warehouse must undergo inspection procedures, while retail goods from passenger ships and rural goods are exempt from inspection. Rural goods that are more than 100 dan must be inspected by the Association. If the goods on the passenger ships are purchased by the flour mills, the mills will handle the inspection procedures themselves.</p>
<h3>Various Yarn Factories Successively Reduce Working Hours</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of cheap yarn and expensive cotton, coupled with the influence of the North China situation, tight credit, and difficult financial turnover, various yarn factories in this county have decided to implement a reduction in working hours. The Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside Ximen has already implemented a 25% reduction in working hours. The Yukang Yarn Factory in Lihuazhuang outside Beimen also reduced working hours by 50% starting yesterday (the 17th), and completely suspended night shifts. Male and female workers on day and night shifts take turns working three days each week, and continue to observe four days of holiday work each week as before. The reduction in working hours at this factory is greater than that at Zhenxin. The reason for this is not only due to the suffering felt by the entire yarn industry but also related to the weather. The river in front of the factory gate is unusually shallow and difficult to draw water from, so they have no choice but to do so. The Shenxin No. 3 Factory in Taibaodun, Xidou, is currently discussing the issue of reducing working hours with Rong Desheng, Xue Mingjian, and others, and plans to reduce the number of yarn spindles in operation by 10,000, but this will reduce the work of the workers without laying them off. Other factories, such as Guangqin, Fuxing, etc., have not yet implemented a reduction in working hours.</p>
<h3>Farmer Unearths Golden Wine Cups While Weeding Field</h3>
<p>Guo Fulin, a villager from Tangjiaqiao outside the east gate of this city, is engaged in farming and has a modest livelihood. Due to the poor silk harvest this year, he converted the mulberry field next to his house into a rice paddy a few days ago. Suddenly, he unearthed twelve golden wine cups in the soil, each weighing eight taels, and a golden soup ladle weighing seven taels, totaling one hundred and three taels. The wine cups were also stamped with a fire brand. Guo Fulin was overjoyed after unearthing them and is secretly keeping them to himself, claiming that they are copper wine cups and not gold.</p>
<h3>Flying Silk Falls in Shitangwan</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th) at around 11:00 AM, in Shitangwan Town, in the tenth district of this county, flying silk suddenly fell in the sunlight. It was white and soft, either in circles or long shapes, in various forms. Because the texture was very light, it was difficult to pick up after landing, but it was easy to pick up on telephone poles, etc. It stopped at 2:30 PM. The surrounding three or four li of the town were all covered with it. The villagers were all amazed. However, according to old farmers, what fell may be "heavenly silk" or "earthly silk," so it is recorded for the study of geographers.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Farmers Rejoice at Abundant Rainfall</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, this county has experienced scarce rainfall. At this time of year when farmers are transplanting rice seedlings, water is greatly needed. Unexpectedly, for days on end, the sun blazed and there was no sign of rain, and the fields were cracked. The farmers were extremely worried. On the morning of the 16th, the weather changed and a sudden rain shower fell, stopping at noon. In the afternoon, there was more light rain. Agricultural work is expected to be worry-free.</p>
<h3>Mei Li Murder Case Scheduled for Re-examination</h3>
<p>Qin Mingyuan, a soil dealer from Mei Li, died suddenly the night after being arrested by tobacco prohibition officers. The county coroner said that he had taken poison. His family claimed that he had no opportunity to take poison and accused Liu Jinan, Zhang Jijun, and Zhang Daoming (all prohibition officers) of coercing him to death. They have now requested a re-examination. A few days ago, Ding Yuchen from the provincial committee came to Changshu to investigate secretly and believed that Liu, Zhang, and others could not escape responsibility, ordering the county to guard them. Subsequently, due to the efforts of Shi Minyong from the Party committee, they were able to be released on bail. This case has attracted considerable attention from people in society. It is now known that the Wuxi District Court has scheduled Judge Xuan Fang to come to Changshu on the 18th to conduct the re-examination procedures before a final verdict can be made.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Cotton Seedlings Damaged by Pests and Drought</h3>
<p>In the counties under Nantong's jurisdiction, the cotton seedlings have been damaged and withered very greatly by the drought. Fortunately, there was a soaking rain and farmers have been rushing to replant. In the Huainan reclamation area, the cotton fields have suffered even greater losses due to the sudden outbreak of pests caused by the prolonged drought. Various districts are currently seeking remedies.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Opening of the Jiangsu Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference</h3>
<p>In order to develop the cooperative business in the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank, convened the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference.

<h3>Haimen: Prolonged Drought Threatens Disaster</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a prolonged drought. Crops such as cotton and beans in various villages are suffering from withering due to lack of rain, as they have only recently sprouted and are only one or two inches above the ground. In the five or six districts of Xiasha, due to the dry soil, most of the various crops have not been planted. The river water is also gradually becoming shallow, and residents are panicked about drinking water. If there is still no rain this month, a drought will be unavoidable. Farmers, mindful of the painful drought last year, are all showing signs of worry.</p>
<h3>Liuhe: Welcome Rain Saves Withering Crops</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in this county, there has been a prolonged drought. The transplanted rice seedlings were about to wither. Fortunately, at around 8:00 AM yesterday (the 15th), dark clouds filled the sky and there was a heavy rain that lasted for two hours, with more than three inches of rain. The dying crops are all expected to be revived. The farmers are all overjoyed. However, rice prices are still soaring, mostly due to a small number of unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: County Magistrate Goes to the Countryside to Inspect Baodu</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Cao, in view of the importance of the third phase of inspecting Baodu, led Section Chief Wang and clerk Zhang and a party of more than ten people to Fanchuan and Zhangzhuang early on the morning of the 14th to inspect Baodu.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office,</p>
<p>Having read the Nanjing special dispatch in the fourth edition of your esteemed newspaper on the 14th of this month, with the headline "Case of Unauthorized Lake Land Construction in East Tai Lake," which stated that the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, based on successive reports from the Wu County Party Headquarters and the County Farmers' Association, etc., claimed that the unauthorized construction of lake land in East Tai Lake was hindering water conservancy. Villagers, etc., participated in the demolition of the enclosure on the 9th and 10th of this month upon the order of the County Government, but only demolished one-thirtieth of it. On the 10th, Ah Qiao, etc., were beaten by visiting residents, and the security team protected the visiting residents and threatened them. We are especially re-telegraphing to the Party and government authorities to severely punish and stop the ineffective local authorities, in order to maintain the agricultural land and the water of Tai Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and to further request the Jiangsu Construction Department to investigate, etc. We are extremely surprised. Upon investigation, the County Government of this county followed the resolution of the Provincial Government and sent personnel to lead the villagers to demolish the enclosure. In a few days, Li Fuwei and other places outside the mouth were completely demolished. The provincial security team patrols day and night, doing everything possible to maintain public order. Recently, work has been temporarily suspended due to busy agricultural affairs, with no other reason. This department has never submitted a report on this case to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. This news is likely a false rumor, or even a deliberate fabrication by villains. We are especially writing to correct the record, hoping that it will be published to clarify the facts and distinguish right from wrong.</p>

<h3>The Siamese Overseas Chinese Petition Delegation, the Third Group of Representatives Returns Home. Zheng Haoyu and Two Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Scheduled to Go to Beijing Within Days to Appeal to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The oppression of overseas Chinese by the Siamese government has been increasing without end. Recently, Siamese farmers, facing the threat of economic ruin, had a rice looting incident. Unexpectedly, the Siamese government falsely accused the overseas Chinese of instigating it and arrested nine overseas Chinese and imprisoned them. The overseas Chinese in Siam found this humiliation intolerable and specially appointed a third group of representatives to return to the country to petition. The representatives arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The details learned by the Real Estate Journal reporters are as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Representatives Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Our people are outraged by the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese by the Siamese government. Siamese rice merchants were greatly alarmed upon hearing this news. The number of unemployed farmers in the country is increasing day by day, so more than ninety farmers went to the agricultural affairs company to request employment (according to the system, Siamese farmers who are willing to cultivate the land can go to the agricultural affairs company to declare to the landlord that they are willing to cultivate a certain amount of land, and then go through the procedures). Because the company could not accommodate their request, it caused a great riot among the farmers, who looted rice. The Siamese authorities sent police to suppress the riot, and the resulting gunfire caused many casualties to the Siamese farmers. Unexpectedly, the Siamese government, taking the incident as the fault of Chinese instigation, suddenly arrested nine overseas Chinese. Our three million overseas Chinese in Siam, finding themselves repeatedly subjected to disasters, decided that it could not be tolerated. They then appointed Zheng Haonan, Li Fubiao and two others to come to Shanghai yesterday, scheduled to go to Beijing within days to appeal to the Central Government, requesting relief.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Whole Country, Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The representatives sent out a telegram: "To the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, the National Government, the Southwest Executive Department of Guangzhou, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, all newspapers in the country, and civil organizations: The matter of delaying the Chinese issue has lasted more than a month. Our three million overseas Chinese in Siam are in dire straits every day, suffering the unreasonable oppression of this small country. We cry out to the sky, but who feels our pain? Therefore, the entire overseas Chinese community in Siam especially appointed representatives to return home to request the government to strongly negotiate with the Siamese government and to announce the truth to the people of the country. Recently, the Siamese government has shown no intention of modifying these harsh regulations, and has even gone further. We, the overseas Chinese, are alarmed by the danger of future assimilation, and for the sake of implementing our demands, we have once again dispatched Haonan, Fubiao, and others to return home to continue to appeal to the authorities. We earnestly hope that the government will consider the difficulties of the overseas Chinese and continue to negotiate for the overseas Chinese, so as to maintain the feelings of the overseas Chinese and attach importance to the national system. We are deeply grateful and await your orders. Respectfully, the overseas Chinese representatives returning from Siam, Zheng Haonan and Li Fubiao (seal)."</p>
<p>Petition Delegation Returns to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The petition delegation of all circles in Qihai City to assist the Siamese overseas Chinese, went to Beijing a few days ago to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and has now arrived in Beijing. The delegation sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday, saying: "Our delegation arrived in Beijing at 7:30 AM this morning (i.e., the 16th) and is now staying at Central Hotel Room 336. After a short rest, we will decide to carry out the following tasks tomorrow: (1) Petition the government; (2) Receive the press in Beijing; (3) Send a note to the Siamese Far East Inspection Group. All circles in Beijing have expressed great sympathy to our delegation and intend to support us unanimously. The atmosphere is strong. The inspection group is scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the 18th (i.e., today). If there is not enough time, we also hope that Shanghai will prepare to launch a large-scale publicity campaign. We look forward to hearing more details from here tomorrow. We wish you success and hard work, the Petition Delegation, June 16."</p>
<h3>The NEC held its Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Next Year's Budget and the Progress of Projects. Meetings will be Held Once a Month in Both Beijing and Shanghai Hereafter.</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council convened a standing committee meeting at the residence of Zeng Zhongming on Jarre Avenue yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM to discuss the next year's budget and the progress of projects, and adjourned at around 6:40 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Standing Committee Members Present</p>
<p>The National Economic Council convened a standing committee meeting at the residence of Zeng Zhongming on Jarre Avenue yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. All four standing committee members, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, and Song Ziwen, were present, except for Chairman Jiang, who was unable to attend due to military operations directing the suppression of bandits in Sichuan. Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the NEC, also attended to report on the work situation this year and to take minutes. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration, also attended to contribute opinions on health care. The discussion of the next year's budget and project progress was very detailed, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:40 PM.</p>
<p>Meeting Results</p>
<p>According to President Wang, after the end of the standing committee meeting, the National Economic Council has decided to hold two standing committee meetings per month thereafter, one meeting in Shanghai and one meeting in Nanjing. According to Finance Minister Kong, in addition to the next year's budget, detailed decisions were made regarding the next year's project progress. According to Qin Fen, the resolutions of the standing committee meeting still need to be sorted out and will be released after returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Qin Fen's Talk</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Secretary-General Qin Fen of the NEC went to visit NEC standing committee member Song Ziwen to report. He then met with reporters from various newspapers at the NEC's Shanghai office. According to him, the cases discussed at today's (i.e., yesterday's) meeting concerned a report on the expenditures for the 23rd year. The expenses of the association in the 23rd year were reduced compared to the 22nd year. The expenses for the 22nd year for business expenses were 15 million yuan, and water conservancy expenses were 6 million yuan. The expenses for the 23rd year were reduced to 6 million for business expenses and 5 million for water conservancy expenses. The expenses for the 24th year are the same as those for the 23rd year. The 24th year has already been set to begin on July 1st, so the expenses and income for the 23rd year and the budget for the 24th year will be presented for reporting and discussion at this meeting. In terms of work, in addition to reporting on the work situation in the 23rd year, the work situation for the 24th year will also be presented for detailed discussion. The scope of the discussion is (1) highways, (2) water conservancy, (3) agriculture and industry, (4) cotton industry, (5) sericulture, and (6) health care. The detailed situation of this outline of work is yet to be discussed before it can be decided. Regarding the construction of national highways, it is actively underway. The construction of the Sichuan-Hubei, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Gansu highways is also underway and will soon be opened to traffic one after another. The three highways are not only related to the transportation of Sichuan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu, but also have a close relationship with the suppression of the remaining bandits in the four provinces. Apart from this, the early completion of the three highways is of great importance to the suppression of the remaining bandits in Sichuan. Regarding the issue of League of Nations technical cooperation, since Haas, the League of Nations technical cooperation liaison officer stationed in China, returned to Geneva, the League of Nations currently has no need to immediately send personnel to be stationed in China. However, technical cooperation will not be reduced because there is no special envoy stationed in China. As for the arrival of technical experts for guidance, they come and go as in the past. Water conservancy experts Nie Yufu, Gu De, and Womodo have all completed their terms and left China to return to Geneva.</p>
<h3>Mr. Liao Xianlie's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Central Representatives Arrive to Greet, Public Memorial Service This Morning Before Transport to Capital for State Burial</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the coffin of revolutionary martyr Mr. Liao Zhongkai arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday and was immediately transferred to a special train car prepared by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations. A public memorial service will be held at 7:00 AM this morning, after which it will be transported to the capital for a state burial. Details of the arrival of Mr. Liao Xianlie's coffin in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Special Envoy for Receiving the Coffin Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chongqing, the special envoy sent by the Central Government to Guangdong to receive the coffin, arrived in Guangzhou on the 5th of this month. After consulting with the Guangdong authorities and Mr. Liao Xianlie's family to finalize the procedures for transporting the coffin, he departed from Guangzhou on the 13th to transport it to Shanghai. Accompanying him were Madam He Xiangning, Mr. Liao Xianlie's younger brother Liao Enxun, Madam Liao's secretary Zhang Dingyi, and four female servants.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Provide Strict Security</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship arrived at the China Merchants Bureau's central pier. It was fully berthed at approximately 6:20 AM. Chief Inspector Tan of the Municipal Police Bureau, detectives, and Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the Public Concession Police patrolled the pier and provided strict security. The military band dispatched by the Municipal Police Bureau also welcomed the arrival with mournful music. Also present at the pier to oversee everything were Mr. Li Dachao, the section chief of the Municipal Government's First Section, officials from the Guangdong Native Place Association, and several relatives of the Liao family. All welcoming personnel were also waiting at the pier. Banners welcoming the arrival were displayed by the Central Military Academy, the Guangdong Native Place Association, and others.</p>
<p>More Than 300 People Greet at the Pier</p>
<p>Among those who greeted at the pier were Mr. Chen Shuren, representing the Central Party Headquarters; Mr. Gan Naiguang, representing Chairman Chiang; Central Committee members Mr. and Mrs. Liu Yazi and Chen Di; Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng; all members of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Mr. Yu Kaizhan, a consultant at the Ministry of Industries; Mr. Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office; Mr. Cai Jingjun, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau; Mr. Jian Jinglun, the director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau; Mr. Qiu Henian of the Trademark Bureau; Mr. Tang Hai'an, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs; Mr. Li Yuxuan, representing the Guangdong Native Place Association; Liu Qian, Lü Zhe, and Sheng Qunhe, representing all students and staff of the Whampoa Military Academy and the Central Military Academy; and more than 300 relatives and friends of the Liao family.</p>
<p>Representatives Console Madam Liao</p>
<p>After the ship was secured, the representatives boarded the ship to pay their respects to Madam Liao. Madam Liao was resting in the lounge, wearing a black satin cheongsam and a fur-collared overcoat. She appeared unwell and her face was filled with grief. As the representatives and relatives offered their condolences to Madam Liao, tears welled up in her eyes, making the scene extremely sorrowful. She was then assisted off the ship by relatives and briefly sat on the pier. All the welcoming personnel shook hands with Madam Liao and offered their condolences.</p>
<p>Whampoa Students Assist in Carrying the Coffin onto the Vehicle</p>
<p>Mr. Liao Xianlie's coffin was located in the hold of the ship. It was lifted to the pier by a crane. The coffin was placed in a wooden outer coffin, covered with the national flag. A hearse was prepared by the China Funeral Home, but because the wooden outer coffin was too large and the hearse was too small, the wooden outer coffin was temporarily removed. The coffin was wrapped in a red satin quilt, on which were written the words "The Spirit of Martyr Liao Xianlie Will Never Die." It was then carried onto the hearse by more than ten students from the Whampoa Military Academy, including Liu Qian, Lü Zhe, and Sheng Qunhe.</p>
<p>Departure at 7:00 AM to the North Station</p>
<p>At exactly 7:00 AM, the procession departed from the pier. The Municipal Police Bureau's military band led the way, followed by the Boy Scouts, the vehicle carrying Mr. Liao Xianlie's portrait, the hearse, and finally the Liao family relatives. Representatives from all walks of life walked in an orderly manner. The route was protected by Chinese and Western detectives, passing through Broadway Road, Avenue Road, North Sichuan Road, Yu Garden Road, North Henan Road, Baoshan Road, and Xinmin Road to the North Station.</p>
<p>Special Train Parked on Shanghai-Songhu Branch Line</p>
<p>The special train for transporting the coffin was parked on the Shanghai-Songhu branch line at the North Station. It was covered with blue cloth, on which were inscribed the white characters "Special Train for the Coffin of Martyr Liao Zhongkai." One end was decorated with the national flag. A plain-colored archway was erected at the station, and a memorial altar was set up. In front of the altar were wreaths from the Central Executive Committee, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Shanghai Fish Market Preparatory Office of the Ministry of Industries, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, the United Association of Guangdong Merchants, the Whampoa Alumni Association, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Fakui and Liu Jingrong, Yu Kaizhan, the Overseas Transportation Department of the Allied Righteousness, and various branches. The arrangement was particularly neat and solemn.</p>
<p>Central Representatives Hold Salutes</p>
<p>After the coffin arrived at the North Station, it was carried onto the train by Whampoa students, and Mr. Liao Xianlie's portrait from the portrait vehicle was placed on the memorial altar. Mr. Xu Chongqing, the Central Government's special envoy for receiving the coffin, Mr. Chen Shuren, representing the Central Government, Mayor Wu, representatives from all walks of life, and relatives of the Liao family paid their highest respects to Mr. Liao Xianlie's portrait. Finally, Madam Liao paid her respects to Mr. Liao Xianlie and thanked the representatives and relatives before departing.</p>
<p>Madam Liao Suffers from Grief and Illness</p>
<p>After the ceremony, a reporter from the Central News Agency offered condolences to Madam He Xiangning and inquired about her well-being. She stated that she had been suffering from illness recently. Traveling from Guangzhou to Shanghai had worsened her condition due to sea sickness. Therefore, after escorting the coffin to the capital for the state burial, she would return to Shanghai in approximately three days to rest and seek treatment for her chronic ailments.</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service by All Circles at 7:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM this morning, the municipal party and government organs and all circles of the city will hold a public memorial service in front of Mr. Liao Xianlie's coffin on the Shanghai-Songhu branch line at the North Station. All organs and groups will send representatives to participate. Mayor Wu Tiecheng will preside over the ceremony. The memorial pavilion has already been set up, with a bamboo cloth banner hanging in front, inscribed with the words "Public Memorial Service by All Circles in Shanghai for the State Burial of Martyr Liao Zhongkai." At 8:00 AM, the coffin car will be attached to the Shanghai-Nanjing special express train to the capital. Madam Liao and Mr. Xu Chongqing will accompany the train to the capital.</p>
<p>Madam Liao Speaks of Hoping Compatriots</p>
<p>Madam He Xiangning met with a reporter from the National News Agency on the ship. Madam He's hair was already gray, her face showed grief, and she appeared physically weak. When she met with the reporter, she said with a trembling voice, "This time, the Central Government is transporting Mr. Liao's coffin from Guangdong to the capital to be buried in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen. Recalling that Mr. Liao devoted his life to the revolution, following Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's advocacy, being unyielding and working hard for the revolution, he sacrificed himself for this cause. Almost ten years have passed since Mr. Liao's martyrdom, and yet the revolution has not yet succeeded and the national crisis remains. Although I am filled with boundless grief, I still hope that all comrades and compatriots throughout the country will continue Mr. Liao's legacy, complete the revolution, restore the nation, and hope that all the world's small and weak nations will work together." Madam He also told the reporter that she would return to Shanghai in two or three days after escorting Mr. Liao's coffin to the capital.</p>
<p>Radio Stations Report History</p>
<p>In addition to notifying all circles to send representatives to participate in the welcoming of the coffin and the public memorial service, the Municipal Party Headquarters has instructed the Shanghai Wireless Radio Broadcasting Association to direct all radio stations in the city to broadcast reports on the history of Mr. Liao Xianlie's involvement in the revolutionary cause yesterday and today, in order to promote the spirit of revolutionary martyrs' struggle to the citizens for emulation. The Municipal Party Headquarters has also printed a proclamation to comrades and compatriots, detailing Mr. Liao's revolutionary deeds.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank to Launch Chattel Mortgage Loans, Entering Into Contracts With Pawnshops in Various Places to Provide Cash, Offering Low-Interest Loans to Farmers to Regulate Rural Finance</h3>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that the China Farmers Bank, in order to regulate rural finance, has entered into contracts with pawnshops in various places, under which the bank provides cash to the pawnshops, which then offer low-interest loans to farmers to provide general relief. Because there are no banks or money shops established in rural areas of China, the only place for farmers to borrow money is to mortgage items at pawnshops in various towns and villages, with interest rates generally at two percent. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy, farmers have been unable to redeem their mortgaged items, resulting in the closure of pawnshops, making it even more difficult for farmers to borrow money. In light of this situation, the bank has specially launched chattel mortgage loans to provide relief to farmers. The bank's total loan budget for this year is 11.25 million yuan, an increase of 2.76 million yuan compared to last year. The scope of lending mainly focuses on cooperative loans, farmers' chattel mortgages, and cotton industry improvement loans.</p>

<h3>American Economic Mission Hosts Banquet for All Circles Last Night; Six Members Return to the US by Ship This Morning; The Rest to Depart on the Next Sailing; Guo Bingwen and Zhang Gongquan Deliver Sincere Speeches</h3>
<p>The American Economic Mission, which came to China for inspection, has completed its work. Six members of the mission took the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Coolidge to return to the US this morning. Last night, the mission leader, Mr. Forbes, held a banquet at the International Hotel to thank the entire reception committee and Sino-American circles in the city. The Central News Agency reporter has compiled the details as follows:</p>
<p>Departing for the United States Today</p>
<p>The mission's inspection in China has lasted nearly two months and has now been completed. Mission leader Forbes, Deputy Leader Carroll, and members Lame, Wickham, Harkins, and Landman departed last night after the farewell banquet, taking company launches at 12:00 AM and 1:45 AM respectively to board the President Coolidge. All members of the reception committee went to the dock to see them off and presented many flower baskets. Wang Yutai Tea House also prepared many tins of finely packaged tea to give to the mission members. The President Coolidge is scheduled to weigh anchor at 7:30 AM this morning. Mission members Rogers, Bispe, and Combbell will return on the next sailing due to personal matters. It is reported that the mission will still be studying the materials obtained during this inspection on the ship.</p>
<p>Hosting a Banquet for All Circles Last Night</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM last night, the mission held a banquet for the entire reception committee and Sino-American circles at the International Hotel. In addition to all the members of the host side, those present included Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Zheqing, Guo Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, He Bingxian, Wang Boqi, Cao Yunxiang, Pan Guangjiong, He Dekui, Wang Xiaolai, Jin Lüqin, Xia Xiaofang, Miao Zhongxiu, Xu Shanxiang, Zhang Xianglin, Wen Yuqing, Yang Guanghuo, Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Zengji, Xu Peihuang, Yang Hu, Ma Yinchu, Wu Liande, Wu Yunzhai, Xi Demao, Shen Shuyu, Tang Baoshu, Xi Jiming, Lu Ganchen, Li Quanshi, Ma Yinliang, He Xiya, and the commander of the US forces stationed in Shanghai, An Hai, US Consul General Ke Yinhai, and Arnold of the Sino-American Trade Association. There were over 200 people in total. After the meal, dancing was held. Afterwards, the mission members organized their luggage. The reception staff gathered on the second floor and accompanied them to the ship one after another.</p>
<p>Forbes Delivers Speech</p>
<p>At the banquet, the leader of the American Economic Mission, Forbes, stood up and delivered a speech, saying briefly that he was deeply grateful for the companionship and kindly prepared this simple meal in return for the hospitality. He hoped that they would continue to interact with each other to promote the development of Sino-American trade. During the two months of this trip, he deeply felt that China was rich in resources, and that various facilities, such as highways, civil aviation, and construction, were thriving, and that the future development was truly within reach. He and his colleagues will board the ship tonight to return to their country, and will bring back the results of the observation and the opinions exchanged with all circles in China to contribute to the government and people of their country, so as to provide a basis for the development of Sino-American trade. He then raised his glass to thank them for their warm hospitality and wished all those present good health.</p>
<p>Guo Bingwen Responds</p>
<p>Then Dr. Guo Bingwen, the vice chairman of the reception committee, responded, "Gentlemen of the American Mission, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the reception committee and all the organizations present, in response to your kindness. I must first thank you for the grand reception this evening. I heard the leader of the mission praise the thoughtfulness of our reception and the various conveniences in terms of investigation, considering it our obligation in terms of friendship. As Confucius said, 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?' Therefore, our hope is to fulfill our duty as hosts as much as possible, so that the mission can have all kinds of conveniences during their stay in China, in other words, to assist the mission in achieving the goal of increasing trade between China and the United States. Gentlemen of the Mission, it is a great honor for the people of our country to get to know you during your visit to China. The seriousness of your investigation in China, the magnanimous attitude, the humility in receiving people, and the emphasis on facts are deeply felt by all people in our country. We have no need to deny that our country's trade and economic facilities have not been as good as we would like. And the various issues discussed with your country in the past may not be completely agreed upon by each other, but we have at least achieved one goal, that is, mutual understanding and humbly accepting each other's views. Before all the Chinese and foreign guests, I must explain one thing. The problem of trade, no matter how important it is, is only one of the problems of increasing friendship between the two countries. Seeing the officials of your country present, we can know how rapid the increase of diplomatic relations between the two countries is. Recalling the educators, doctors, etc. of your country, we can know the greatness of their contribution to our country's education, medicine and religion. The students studying in the United States present tonight can be associated with the large number of Chinese students studying in American universities every year. Therefore, we believe that in politics, culture, and commerce, etc., it is sufficient to illustrate that the relationship between China and the United States for more than a century and a half has been purely friendly and cordial, and the national friendship is pure, which is justified. Governor Forbes, I recall that you once said that at any banquet in China, the people of our country never fail to mention the silver problem. It can be said that the opinions of the people of our country on the silver problem have been contributed to you as much as possible. I can make an exception tonight and no longer raise this issue. However, there is one point that can be used to help you think, that is, the commercial counselor of your country, Mr. Arnold, once said that a Chinese friend of his asked him to answer the question of how to dispose of the large amount of silver purchased by the United States. Mr. Ann replied with a smile, 'The United States has many places where dark clouds are scattered, and the white light of silver will be used to dispel them.' Gentlemen, there are also many places in our country where dark clouds are scattered, but there are also many places where white light is scattered, in other words, the hope for our country's future is also unlimited. Since the enemy country has made considerable efforts in various political foundations, economic construction, and social transformation in recent years, if we can give it time, our country is convinced that various difficulties will be gradually eliminated, and a stable and prosperous new China will be established. The gentlemen also expressed optimism after returning from the interior, although the facts are like this, but the encouragement of the gentlemen is enough to make us work hard. However, the people of our country also deeply know that the difficulties ahead of our country are heavy, and the responsibility is also very heavy, and only we ourselves can bear this responsibility. The famous saying that God helps those who help themselves is what we really believe in. However, we always welcome and accept the good intentions and assistance of friendly countries, especially the United States, because your country is most interested in the safety of our country, and there are reasons for cooperation between the two countries. Your country is rich in machinery, industrial knowledge, and capital, and our country is rich in natural resources and manpower, which is the best place for foreign investment. Therefore, I firmly believe that cooperation between the two countries will be mutually beneficial. Gentlemen, I must bring this to an end. In a few hours, our guests will leave here, which is very appropriate. The purpose of their coming to China is very large, and they will be busy with the report of the investigation afterwards. We deeply regret that we cannot keep you here any longer, but we sincerely hope that your work can be very successful. Finally, I would like to express our greatest respect to the Sino-American Trade Association and the American Foreign Trade Association, which sponsored your visit to China. The various groups in our country are always ready to work hard to cooperate. I sincerely hope that in the near future, the enemy country can also organize a Chinese mission to the United States to respond to the grand intention of your visit to China and to promote the further increase of the friendly relations between the two countries. I would like to represent the entire reception committee and the various groups in Shanghai to wish you a safe journey and all the best."</p>
<p>Zhang Gongquan's Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Gongquan, the director of the reception committee, responded, "Governor Forbes, Admiral An Hai, Consul General Ke Yinhai, Mayor Wu, and all of you ladies and gentlemen, I recall that in mid-April, I had the honor of attending the welcome to the American Economic Mission to China, and time flies, and tonight I have to bid farewell to you. I have been traveling in Beiping for a month, and I am very happy to be able to return to my hometown before you leave China. The fact that the American mission has traveled all over the world for the benefit of trade between the two countries for nearly two months and has achieved so much is unprecedented. This is to be congratulated on the noble mission. As for the reception committee, it is an honor to be able to cooperate and share all the optimistic images of the noble mission during the trip and investigation of the noble mission. Therefore, I dare to tell you that it is a pleasure to be able to do my best as a host. Now that we are about to part, I can't help but feel lost. Dr. Guo Bingwen has said it very clearly, and I don't want to say too much. I have paid close attention to the actions and all the actions of the responsible mission, and I am glad to know that every time you gather with the people of the country, you have a spirit of friendship. The fact that you can see all aspects of China's situation with the eyes of a critic will be a faithful report to your government and people after you return to your country. If you want to understand China's problems, in addition to the development you have witnessed, please do not forget the background, and the whole review of all of China's problems is the only way. When we try to solve this problem, we always feel that factors that have nothing to do with the real argument cannot be separated. Specifically, the way to increase foreign trade depends on whether the factors related to the economic and political nature can be reviewed in detail. 'What is the result of the mission?' This is what all related parties want to ask. My answer is that we do not expect immediate results, but we feel that long-term contact and the increase of friendship have brought closer understanding and goodwill between the people of the two countries. This is the best and most lasting of all results. There are many people from friendly countries who come to China and express their willingness to help China, but I hope that the noble mission will not be troubled by this. We only hope that you will understand, which is the basis for all cooperation. It is a great honor for us to have the opportunity to meet with the members of the noble mission, and it is regrettable that we have to say goodbye to you now."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's General Meeting of All Crew Members: Opposing Salary Cuts by Shipping Companies; Declaration Issued to the Government</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, citing the decline of the shipping industry, requested the Central Government to issue 10 million yuan in shipping bonds. It decided to reduce the salaries of all crew members earning 15 yuan or more by 20% starting July 1, which triggered strong opposition from all crew members. The Masters’ Association, Marine Engineers' Association, and Ship Radio Officers' Association have been holding meetings for days to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday afternoon, the three groups held a joint meeting and decided on a method of opposition. At that time, it was decided to issue a declaration of resistance to salary cuts by shipping companies and to submit a petition to the Central Government requesting fair handling. The details of this matter are described below.</p>
<p>Crew Members' General Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, all crew members gathered at the Marine Engineers' Association to convene a joint meeting of the Masters’ Association, the Radio Officers' Association. Responsible representatives, including Lin Yi, Di Guixuan, Jun Yu, Jiang Shangtao, and others, were present to discuss the issue of salary cuts by shipping companies starting on July 1. The representatives unanimously expressed their opposition, arguing that the shipping industry was not as declining as the shipping companies claimed, and that the salaries of Chinese crew members were already very low, only about two-fifths of those of foreign crew members, while the cost of living in society was not decreasing. They believed that the salary cut was intended for other purposes. The atmosphere at the meeting was very agitated, and it was decided to issue a declaration. A resolution was passed immediately, and several countermeasures were discussed, which were not announced for the time being. The meeting adjourned at around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The declaration was jointly signed by the Marine Engineers' Association, the Masters’ Association, and the Ship Radio Officers' Association. The original text is as follows: "Amidst the North China crisis, with national peril imminent, the crew members, vigilant against foreign aggression reaching its final stage, rely on the nation to unite and not allow the shipping and capital parties to create trouble and disrupt themselves, thus providing opportunities for foreigners. Therefore, in recent years, crew members, although subjected to oppression and feeling deep pain, have endured it silently, without large-scale protests to improve their own interests. This was initially motivated by patriotism, hoping for temporary peace. Unexpectedly, yesterday we received a letter from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association and a subsequent declaration published in the newspaper, citing the decline in business and deciding at a meeting that from July 1, the monthly salaries of crew members earning 15 yuan or more would be reduced by 20%, and that the government would be asked to issue shipping bonds to rescue shipping companies. Our associations believe that their statements are untrue and that these actions are purposeful, sacrificing the crew members in order to achieve their goals. The means are extremely harsh. Therefore, our associations have jointly discussed and united in opposition, first revealing their inside story, and then refuting their claims to inform the public and clarify right and wrong. Since the National Government established its capital, the rental fees paid for shipping vessels for military use have been calculated according to the tonnage of each vessel, and expenses such as coal, water, and pilotage have been paid in full. This kind of business is far superior to shipping companies carrying cargo on their own. Shipping companies cannot guarantee that each voyage will be fully loaded, but when rented for military use, they are fully paid according to tonnage. Given this income, which is better is obvious. To claim that they are losing rights and serving the government is simply untrue and shows a lack of gratitude. The September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, combined with floods and droughts, have superficially affected shipping companies, but examining the internal situation, it is not true that the shipping industry is on the verge of collapse, as the association claims. Let us cite a major example: after the Northeast Incident, with commercial goods decreasing and freight rates falling daily, new ships have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, swarming in. Such as Xinpu, Mingxing, Jing'an, Songshan, Yongjia, Shouchang, Haishang, Dalu, Dasheng, Dada, Yuanxing, Kunxing, Huachang, Huaqiang, Xinmaoli, Beian, Muyou, Fuping, Zhongxing, Yixing, Luxing, Daxing No. 1, Xinhongxing, Tianyou, Haihua, Shunfeng, Yuanchang, Minquan, Debao, as well as the Yijiang, Yixing, Qitai, Yichang, and Qichun, Xietan, etc. that are currently being negotiated, roughly totaling about 40 ships. The number is rarely seen, and the flourishing image of the shipping companies' business, is clear for all to see. Facts speak louder than words, and discerning people can see for themselves. Moreover, coal costs account for a large portion of the expenses of a ship, and before September 18th, the price of coal was about ten taels per ton, while from September 18th to the present, the price has been about ten yuan per ton. For a smaller 1,500-ton ship traveling between Shanghai and Tianjin, a round trip requires 100 to 120 tons of coal. The savings from this are about 400 to 600 yuan. And those sailing to South China use Keelung (Taiwan) coal, which costs only seven yuan per ton, or about five yuan at the market price. Therefore, factually speaking, the monthly expenses of a 1,500-ton ship are about 2,500 yuan, and 80% of that is 2,000 yuan. However, the shipping companies have benefited from the disaster, and the savings on coal are enough to offset the salary reduction. As for the financial difficulties and the difficulty in obtaining cash, this is indeed true. However, the various shipping companies have a precedent of owing wages. For example, Sanbei often owes two months' salary, which is well known. Using this as an excuse is weak. Furthermore, the company is a giant in the private shipping industry. At the beginning of its establishment, the captain of the Shengfu ship was paid 550 yuan per month, the chief engineer 400 yuan, the first assistant engineer 150 yuan, the second assistant engineer 100 yuan, and the third assistant engineer 60 yuan. In recent years, the company's crew salaries have not been so high and have long been reduced. However, the company has developed over the years from one ship, Shengfu, to as many as 18 ships, and has even spun off into Hongan and Ningyu companies, with as many as 13 ships. Also, a certain company purchased a ship with tens of thousands of capital and once paid bonuses of up to hundreds of thousands of yuan, exceeding the capital by several times, and now it has expanded to six ships. Therefore, judging by this, there is some doubt about the so-called business failure of the shipping companies. Is the failure to make ends meet due to crew expenses, or is it due to mismanagement? Are there expenses that go beyond the scope of business, and are they blaming the crew for something they didn't do? Furthermore, the shareholders of the various shipping companies receive dividends from business profits, and the staff receive bonuses, but the crew members have never enjoyed this right. Even if the shipping companies are currently suffering from the depression, they do not consider the hardships of the crew members and are willing to impose oppression and unilaterally reduce salaries. Then, why not take into account the overall situation, put oneself in the position of others, and also reduce the passenger and cargo fares by 20% across the board? The shipping companies cannot come up with this plan, clearly seeking private gain. How can they convince people? Furthermore, nationalizing the shipping industry is a plan set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was in debt for tens of millions of yuan, was nationalized, its business has been booming and improving day by day. Then, if the private companies really value transportation and know to ask the government to issue 10 million yuan in bonds, why not fundamentally solve the problem by asking to be nationalized? Because nationalization prevents the shipping companies from profiting from it, reducing a layer of exploitation on all sides, and nationalized shipping cannot do without crew members. The crew members are not likely to play tricks. Fearing that their demands will not be met, they first reduce the crew members' salaries, clearly provoking a storm and causing human-made disasters, sacrificing all the crew members as a tool to coerce the government, while still claiming that crew members losing their jobs, and their livelihood being cut off, will increase social worries. This can truly be called confusing black and white, and turning right and wrong upside down. Our associations have long known that there are many enlightened people in the shipping industry. Are our associations' words reasonable? And those who preside over this decision and give orders, are there any monopolizing attempts to benefit a few people? Someone will be able to distinguish this. Our associations, in order to break the conspiracy and not be used by others, if the national government issues 10 million yuan in shipping bonds, it would be better to nationalize all private shipping. The crew members are willing to serve the government, and all issues can be discussed. If it comes from the association, then our associations dare to be bold and see if all the members of the association can stop sailing. Our associations are a collection of laborers, but we still roughly understand things. We will not bow our heads and surrender immediately after being threatened, and allow ourselves to be slaughtered. In addition to having already decided to submit a separate petition to the government, asking for fair handling, and to unite together to seek resistance, in the event of gradual coercion, no matter what unexpected events occur, the shipping companies shall bear the responsibility. We hereby announce the inside story to the people of the country, hoping for public judgment. China Merchant Marine Masters’ Association, China Marine Engineers' Association, China Ship Radio Officers' Association. Declaration of All Crew Members Opposing Salary Cuts."</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government</p>
<p>At the same time, representatives of the three groups, on behalf of all crew members, submitted a petition to five places: the Central Government, the Ministry of Transportation, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Executive Yuan. Their wording was the same as the declaration, requesting the Central Government not to be misled by the shipping companies' distortion of right and wrong and their confusion of black and white, and asking the government to handle this matter fairly. In the event that the shipping companies are willing to sacrifice crew members in order to obtain the issuance of shipping bonds, they would rather nationalize private shipping to avoid crew members losing their jobs. The petition to the Central Government will be sent out today. Currently, crew members and shipping companies have reached extremes, and the future is quite dangerous.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce's Request That Stamp Tax Penalties Not Be Revised; Simple Procedures in Summary Court; No Need to Restore Review Committee</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce believes that the stamp tax penalty measures have caused great hardship to merchants and citizens. It sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the first of this month, requesting that Article 8 of the inspection rules be revised to alleviate merchants' difficulties. The federation received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday disapproving the request. The federation's telegram and the Ministry of Finance's reply are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegram: The federation's telegram to the Ministry of Finance stated, "We recently received a telegram from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce stating, 'Upon investigation, Article 8 of the Ministry of Finance's inspection rules for stamp tax states, 'When violations of the stamp tax law are discovered during inspections, a list of the inspected location, the inspected merchant, the name and number of documents, and the facts should be prepared and sent to the local government for transfer to the judicial authorities for legal review.' In this city, stamp tax cases investigated from the business community are immediately sent to the court by the Finance Bureau in accordance with this law, resulting in repeated litigation burdens, which often cannot be completed for several months. As a result, businesses are abandoned, and closures and bankruptcies are common. This association proposes to restore the stamp tax review committee and revise Article 8 of the inspection rules to comply with public opinion.' Upon investigation, stamp tax penalties are handled by judicial authorities, which indeed causes endless hardship to merchants and citizens. The reasons for the telegram above are reasonable. We respectfully request your ministry to investigate and approve, and to comply with public opinion to revise Article 8 of the inspection rules to alleviate merchants' difficulties.' Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully kowtows, with seal."</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Reply: "Telegram received. Based on the telegram's statement regarding the stamp tax penalty and the request to revise Article 8 of the judicial rules to alleviate merchants' difficulties, the telegram has been noted. Upon investigation, this matter was directly reported to the ministry by the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce. At that time, the reply stated, 'Upon investigation, in the past, stamp tax bureaus in various places often imposed harsh and excessive penalties on cases that violated the stamp tax laws. The review committees that were established also often showed bias and favoritism in their reviews. In order to correct long-standing abuses and ensure fairness, the ministry has specifically stipulated that since the stamp tax stamps are sold by the post office, the cases discovered by the municipal and county governments during inspections and by the provincial stamp tax bureaus during inspections must be sent to the local judicial authorities for review. In the judicial authorities' review of these cases, the summary court conducts the trial, and the procedures are quite simple. What litigation burden is there to speak of? Moreover, the establishment of the review committee was originally based on the stamp tax agencies as the main body. Now that the stamp tax bureaus in various places have been abolished, there is no need to restore it. The request should not be discussed.' You should be informed accordingly. This approval."</p>
<h3>Accountants' Association Requests to Assist in Supervising Industrial and Commercial Liquidation Matters</h3>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance promulgated six measures for supervising liquidation, and supervisors are selected for all banks and money shops that have been closed and are in liquidation to supervise the process. The National Accountants Association believes that this is a timely and effective measure, but has some comments on Articles 2 and 4 of the measures, which have already been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. Now, the Shanghai Accountants Association, in view of the recent repeated occurrences of industrial and commercial company and firm closures and liquidation events, decided yesterday to submit a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the example of the Ministry of Finance's supervisory liquidation measures be used to supervise the industrial and commercial liquidation matters in this city, and to forward the request to the Ministry of Industry and instruct the construction departments and social affairs bureaus of all provinces and cities to implement it uniformly. The original request is recorded as follows: "Request to Assist in Supervising Industrial and Commercial Liquidation Matters. We have investigated that our country's merchants and citizens cannot fully understand the laws and regulations, especially the liquidation procedures and regulations, which are complicated and difficult to understand in detail. Therefore, when our members execute liquidation cases, they often encounter difficulties due to merchants adhering to old habits. Although this is a difficulty for accountants in performing their duties, it also greatly deviates from the original intention of the legal system to protect the people. Recently, we read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Finance has stipulated six measures for supervising liquidation, selecting special commissioners to supervise the liquidation matters of various banks and money shops, bringing them into compliance with the regulations, and the effectiveness can be expected. Since there is an example, we propose that your bureau also assist in the liquidation matters of industrial and commercial companies and firms in this city, so that liquidators and liquidation staff can receive the assistance of government supervision, and merchants can understand the responsibility of complying with laws and regulations. We humbly offer our knowledge and hope that it will be adopted, and we respectfully request that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and instruct the construction departments of all provinces and the social affairs bureaus of all cities to implement it uniformly, which would be for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Generally Uses Member Bank Cashier's Checks</h3>
<p>China News Agency reports that the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange on Avenue Edward VII has recently decided through a board meeting, in order to maintain market credit in view of the extremely tight money market, that transaction chips of larger amounts will generally use cashier's checks from member banks of the Bankers Association. The board of directors has informed the brokers' association, which in turn issued a notice yesterday to inform everyone.</p>
<h3>Exchange to Auction Japanese Yarn</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that Japanese manufacturers stopped joining the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange to trade jointly after the September 18th Incident. Now, the Japanese side feels inconvenient. The chairman of the Japanese yarn mills in Shanghai, Funatsu, has negotiated with Mu Ouchu, the chairman of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, several times, and it is gradually becoming a reality. Last Tuesday, the exchange held a plenary board meeting, and it is said that it expressed acceptance of the Japanese side's requirements in principle. It will now resume the previous market transactions from August 1 of this year. The only matter currently under discussion is the division of standards. Upon investigation, there are currently a total of 30 Japanese yarn mills in Shanghai. If they join the exchange, Chinese yarn and cloth will face more pressure, and Japanese yarn will have another place to dump its products.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Urging Member Representatives to Register for the General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a notice yesterday to the various trade associations that have not registered for the current general meeting, stating: "Dear Sirs, Upon investigation, the current general meeting is scheduled to be held at 1 PM on June 23. All member registration lists and the 30% public bond fund to be paid must be submitted to the chamber before June 15. We have already sent separate notices and published announcements in the newspaper. Now, the above deadline has passed, and the date of the meeting is approaching. Upon investigation, your association's representative registration list and the fees to be paid have not been sent to the chamber, which is deficient in fulfilling the obligations of a member. We are hereby sending another letter urging you to check and submit the registration list along with the fees to be paid to the chamber before June 20. This matter concerns the necessary procedures before the general meeting, and we hope you will not delay. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders County Government to Ban Cherishing-Paper Associations; Waste Paper Can Be Used as Raw Material for Papermaking</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, based on a report from Ye Yinshan, chairman of the China Paperboard Factory Association, stating, "Our association is organized by paperboard factories across the country. The factories of our members, including Hangzhou Huafeng, Jiaxing Minfeng, Suzhou Huasheng, and Dahua, Tianjin Zhenhua, etc., are all engaged in the machine-made production of various paperboards, and have been approved by the Ministry of Industry and registered. However, waste paper, which is the raw material for making paperboard, is also a major commodity. Each factory has entrusted people to purchase it in metropolitan commercial ports. However, old customs and superstitions have not been eliminated. Cherishing-Paper Associations are still established in various places, carrying baskets on their shoulders to collect and burn waste paper, which reduces the original production of waste paper. The raw materials for papermaking are greatly affected. It is believed that in the past, when people's knowledge was not developed, they thought that waste paper was combustible, throwing ash into the sea, and could not be re-made into paper, which would desecrate the relics of sages and virtuous men. Now that the times are enlightened, such backward thinking should not be allowed to exist. Moreover, if waste paper is sold to factories to be used as raw material for papermaking, factories can make waste useful and reduce the purchase of imported raw materials. On the other hand, it can also be used to make money and supplement livelihood. However, Cherishing-Paper Associations hire workers to collect and burn waste paper, which still consumes wages. The result is the waste of natural resources. Comparing the two, it seems to have a great relationship with the problem of people's livelihood and economy. One gain and one loss cannot be counted with reason. For this reason, we submit a document and request your review and approval to instruct all subordinate units to ban the original Cherishing-Paper Associations, to cherish material resources and eliminate bad desires, which would be for the public convenience, etc. Based on this, in addition to approval, the county magistrate is ordered to comply with the above-mentioned matters."</p>

<h3>Jiande Bank Case Announced Yesterday; Chai Chuangui et al. Fined</h3>
<p>Jiande Bank went bankrupt, and all the directors and general manager Chai Chuangui et al. were sued by more than ten creditors, including Wei Haijiang et al., for crimes such as embezzlement and fraud. The First Special District Local Court repeatedly held hearings to investigate the various circumstances, which have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the case was heard and debated by the judge Liu Yugui and the lawyers of both parties on Monday afternoon, and the debate was concluded at 8 PM.

The incidental civil lawsuit in this case was transferred to the civil court of this court for trial.</p>
<h3>Bandit Fears Punishment, Hangs Himself; Corpse Examined Yesterday</h3>
<p>The bandit Chen Gaofu, age 42, from Jiangbei, gathered more than ten accomplices on the night of April 15th of this year in Yaojing Town, Songjiang, and kidnapped Lu Fushan, a farmer from the area, hiding him in a small boat in the Zhangjiagang River in Shanghai. He sent a letter to the family, demanding 15,000 yuan in foreign currency for ransom. He negotiated the ransom twice in Shanghai, but the matter was not kept secret. Detectives from the Xinzha Police Station in both the Chinese and foreign concessions arrested Chen and 14 other male and female bandits, and rescued the hostage. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court and detained for seven days. All these details have been reported in the newspapers. The police, having learned that Chen Gaofu was the ringleader, also kept him in a separate cell. Unexpectedly, fearing punishment, at 11:30 AM the day after the interrogation, he tore his pants into strips and made a rope, which he tied to a water faucet next to his cell and hanged himself.  A western policeman named Mei Yin discovered him while on duty, immediately tried to take him down and attempted artificial respiration, but to no avail. He was then sent to a nearby hospital, but it was too late. He died en route, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor specially appointed by the First Special District, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, court clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the office to examine the body. Mei Yin, a western policeman, explained the situation, stating that he had seen the deceased peacefully sleeping in his cell at 11:00 AM that morning, but half an hour later, he was discovered to have hanged himself. Judge Guo then ruled that the deceased Chen Gaofu, a male, had indeed committed suicide by hanging, and the body was handed over to the Pushan Mountain Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Contracting Dining Car, Cheating Money; Bai Hongxun Sentenced; Imprisonment for One Year and Six Months; Fined Four Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>Bai Hongxun, a resident of No. 20 Daodeli, Baylor Road, in the French Concession, from Gaoyou, worked as a lawyer in Shanghai. In August of last year, he falsely claimed to be arranging contracts for dining cars, tea rooms, and vendors on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. He successively took 1,800 yuan from Jiang Youtang, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 21 Jingdeli, Shishan Road, Zhabei, and Feng Yishen, a native of Nantong, as "arrangement fees," issuing receipts. Later, Jiang and others inquired at the Railway Bureau after a long delay without receiving any news, and discovered that Bai had committed fraud under a false name. The Railway Bureau's police reported the case, and on April 23rd of last year, detectives arrested Bai and escorted him to the Second Special Court. The Police Department's lawyer prosecuted him for fraud under Article 36 of the Criminal Law. The victims also filed an incidental private lawsuit, seeking to recover the defrauded funds. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has now been concluded after interrogation. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Qiu HuanYing presided over the Eighth Criminal Court and sentenced Bai Hongxun to one year and six months of imprisonment for continuously and jointly defrauding others into handing over their property with the intent of illegally possessing it, and fined him 400 yuan. He was also ordered to compensate Jiang Youtang and others 1,800 yuan. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on a 1,000 yuan surety to guarantee his appearance when summoned. If no surety was provided, he would be returned to custody. Bai immediately declared his dissatisfaction and wished to appeal. The court granted his request, and the bailiffs took Bai down and returned him to the detention center.</p>
<h3>After Li Pengxian's Death; Inheritance Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Li's Eldest Son Sells Farmland; Family Members Request Confirmation of Invalidity</p>
<p>Li Pengxian, a native of Ningbo, was a prominent figure in the pawnshop and banking industries. Later, due to business downturns, the businesses he ran were closed down early. Li had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son was Yisheng, and the second son was Yusheng. Zeng Duo had married early. Yisheng established Yuchang Hardware Store on Ningbo Road, and Yusheng established Dasheng Printing and Silk Factory in Shanghai and Ningbo. The two daughters were also married. In addition to his wife, Sun, with whom he had a daughter, Yusheng also took Shi Zhongde, a woman from Suzhou, as a concubine. Shi gave birth to a son named Chenghao, who is now fifteen years old. Recently, Li Pengxian passed away due to illness. His second son, Yusheng, also died about a month after Pengxian's death (January 27th of this year, according to the lunar calendar). Li Pengxian's estate has always been divided. Yisheng received it. At the end of last month, Li Yisheng suddenly sold a portion of the estate, namely five fen one li and seven hao of farmland located at No. 361, Zizhi, Gao Xihuan household, 27 Bao, 11 Tu, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, for 3,800 yuan. Although his nephew Chenghao co-signed the contract at the time, Chenghao's mother, Shi Zhongde, later claimed that Chenghao's signature was obtained under duress, and the sales contract did not bear the names of the uncle and nephew. She filed a lawsuit to confirm that the contract was invalid, and also published a statement opposing it. In the civil court of the First Special District Court, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special Court opened the Sixth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon for questioning. According to Li Shi, he explained the situation at the time. Li Yisheng was absent, but lawyer Wang Chuanbi appeared in court, stating that the plaintiff Li Chenghao and his legal representative Shi were both present at the time of signing. However, the case is a family dispute, and mediation is currently underway, with the possibility of a settlement. Judge Shen reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case: Bandit Wang Chunqi; Approved for Transfer to Zhejiang Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Did Not Commit Crimes in Shanghai; Mistress Released Without Charge</p>
<p>You A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Old Gate Police Station, and Detective Liu Junqing, previously arrested Wang Chunqi, a native of Shaoxing, a robber, and his mistress Wang Chen, at No. 59 Wu Yu Li, Mersal Tirou Road, French Concession, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation, it was found that Wang's real name was Wang Miaosheng, and he had not committed any crimes in Shanghai, but had committed robbery and other crimes in Zhejiang Province, and had been wanted by the authorities. The Zhejiang Security Bureau was notified to send personnel to Shanghai to transfer him. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for further questioning. The Second Branch of the Zhejiang Security Bureau sent personnel to the court to request permission to transfer the two. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that according to the police investigation, there was considerable evidence that Wang had committed a crime, but Wang Chen was not involved, as she only became Wang's mistress after Wang committed the crime. Therefore, they did not object to Wang's transfer, but requested that Shi be released. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned Wang and others, he ruled that Wang Chunqi be handed over to the personnel from the Zhejiang Security Bureau for return to Zhejiang for investigation and prosecution. Wang Chen was released.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Counterfeit Money Case; One Criminal Apprehended in Concession</h3>
<p>Security Bureau Sends Personnel to Transfer; Court Orders Postponement for Further Questioning</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Security Bureau and the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently cracked down on a counterfeit banknote manufacturing operation at No. 126 Hepingfang, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, seizing more than 100,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes and detaining more than 20 suspects. Last Saturday, Zhang Kangmei and Kong Rongsheng, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with the arrested criminals Wang A'gen and Wang Jin, reported to the Old Gate Police Station, stating that the two criminals had confessed that Li Fenglin, the owner of a new inn at No. 37, Lane 117, Shandong Road, from Changzhou, was significantly involved in the case and requested assistance in arresting him. Detective Wang Shusen and Detective Sun Dafa went to the inn and arrested and detained Li. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court, where Judge Qian Hongye began the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that when the police officers and the Public Security Bureau personnel went to arrest the defendant, the criminals they brought back could not identify the defendant. After further investigation by the police, it was learned that Wang A'gen's statement that Li was involved in the case was actually because Li was acquainted with the main criminal in the case, Weng Jiamei, who is currently at large. Therefore, Wang confessed to the Public Security Bureau that Weng should be arrested, and asking Li might reveal his whereabouts.  Therefore, the police believed that he could not be immediately transferred. It was found that Li had been living in the International Settlement for 18 years. Therefore, if the Public Security Bureau, etc., need to transfer him, they must have sufficient evidence to prove it. Wei Hua, a Major Staff from the Security Bureau, also submitted a case, requesting the transfer. However, Wei was completely unaware of the facts. Judge Qian briefly questioned Li and stated that the Security Bureau had no right to investigate such cases. Therefore, the application for transfer was not in accordance with the law and should be made to the court by the court or the Public Security Bureau. The court then ordered that the case be postponed for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Economic Expert Xu Peikun Talks; Our Country Should Not Abandon Silver Standard; Economic Decline and Abandonment is Self-Disturbance; Currency Research Should Adopt Strengths</h3>
<p>Xu Peikun, director of the Social and Economic Survey Institute of the National Economic Committee, gave an important speech to the Dagongshe reporter yesterday about why our country should not abandon the silver standard. The record is as follows,</p>
<p>Silver Standard System; No Need to Abolish</p>
<p>Xu first stated that our country has used the silver standard system for hundreds of years, and there has been no major harm. Most economic scholars, seeing that European and American countries have adopted the gold standard system and the national economy is gradually on track, advocate abandoning the silver standard and adopting other standards in response to the needs of the times. However, in terms of the current economic situation in our country, this view does not seem acceptable. Our country's economy is backward, and most of the people are poor. Using the silver standard system is still too high a level. If we change to another standard, it will inevitably disrupt finance.</p>
<p>Inspection of Various Countries; Our Country's Currency</p>
<p>Recently, economic experts from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and other countries plan to come to China together to investigate our country's monetary system, and divide into domestic and foreign research. The research specialists sent by various countries this time are all erudite scholars who have a thorough study of our country's financial situation. Our country should conduct a systematic study of the current situation of our country's monetary system for the research specialists of various countries, and adopt and implement the results of their research to greatly benefit our country's financial problems.</p>

Hang was so angry that he wanted to die, so he secretly swallowed poison to commit suicide. Fortunately, the shop owner discovered it early and immediately took him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He recovered his life. Unexpectedly, Hang was determined to commit suicide. As soon as he was discharged from the hospital, he sneaked into the empty car room of his relative Chen A'bao, a driver, at No. 8, Lane 2, Hobilan Road, tied his feet tightly, untied his belt, and hanged himself on the beam.

<h3>The Day Before Yesterday's Welcome Rain; Yesterday the Market Stabilized; Rice, Cotton, and Wheat Each Down Three to Five Cents, People's Hearts are Stable; Rainfall is Still Too Little, Hoping for Human Relief</h3>
<p>Since the heavy rain in the city on the afternoon of the 15th, the rice, cotton, and wheat markets have stabilized yesterday, and people's hearts have also become optimistic. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Rainfall the Day Before Yesterday; According to news from the Xujiahui Observatory, the amount of rainfall obtained in the city the day before yesterday was a total of 0.63 (inches as the unit). From January to the day before yesterday this year, the rainfall was 13.48 inches, which is 1.67 inches less than last year. Therefore, although there have been several welcome rains, there is still a lack in reality.</p>
<p>Market Recovery; Due to insufficient rainfall, all rice, cotton, and wheat transactions in the city were worried that the autumn harvest would be damaged as a result, so people were panicked and worried. After the rain on the 15th, all of them recovered yesterday. It is estimated that the highest white glutinous rice market opened at 13.8 yuan last weekend, and yesterday it fell by 12 cents. Saigon was previously at 11 yuan, but is now at 10.95 yuan. No. 3 foreign rice and Xiaojiao rice have both returned to a flat five cents. The foreign rice and Xiaojiao rice have both returned to a flat five cents. In addition, there is a current stock of 1.34 million bags of foreign rice, so it is relatively stable at present. The wheat price also rose by five cents from 3.5 yuan, falling by three or four cents. Flour previously closed at 2.385 yuan, and opened at 2.36 yuan yesterday, with a gradual equalization of one to three or four cents per month. Cotton previously closed at 30.9 yuan, and opened at 30.7 yuan yesterday, a decrease of two cents. The July and August also saw a flattening, while the futures rose by one cent. The spot price of yarn is the same as the previous day, all at 162.9 yuan. The next few months will be slightly higher.</p>
<p>Still Hoping for Planning; This rain spread throughout Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou. Rainfall cannot be called insufficient, but in order to prepare for the worst, farmers are still very eager for the authorities and charities to prepare for relief as soon as possible, because the rainfall is scarce. Unless human efforts are made to provide relief, the weather cannot be relied upon. However, according to studies by those familiar with astronomy, it is currently the time of the yellow plum, and the west wind is blowing. There will be no major drought this year, because the folks have a saying that "The west wind in the plum season brings rain, the west wind in the plum season brings rain at night," it seems that there will be no drought this year.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Paper Mill Case: Litigation Unresolved After Three Years; Zhao Guanqing Appeals, Zheng Yicheng Appears in District Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Paper Mill on Chang'an Road, Zhabei, was originally the property of Zhao Guanqing. Subsequently, in November of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], Zhao leased all the machinery, factory site, and production assets to Ningbo native Zheng Yicheng for operation, renaming it Minsheng Yuji Paper Mill. A lease contract was established. After the January 28th Incident [1932], the Minsheng Mill was destroyed by fire. Subsequently, due to Zheng Yicheng's violation of the lease contract, Zhao initiated litigation in court in May of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], which has continued for three years. Currently, although Zhao Guanqing requested the Shanghai District Court's execution division to auction off Shanghai Paper Mill (where Zheng Yicheng is currently the factory manager), Shanghai Paper Mill's manager Zhang Deming and shareholder Ye Yinshan, among others, filed an objection, so the Jiangsu High Court ordered a stay of the auction. Zhao Guanqing then filed a private prosecution in the Shanghai District Court's criminal division against Zheng Yicheng, Zhang Deming, Ye Yinshan, and others, alleging fraud and damage by Zheng Yicheng and others. The trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty for all three defendants. Zhao Guanqing, dissatisfied with the verdict, within the statutory period, retained three lawyers, Zuo Dedao, Li Mian, and Ye Kuan, to file an appeal, stating that the first defendant, Zheng Yicheng, in his capacity as representative of Minsheng Yuji Paper Mill, should be responsible for returning the factory site to its original condition and compensating for unpaid rent. After the civil judgment became final, during the compulsory execution, the machinery and other items that Zheng Yicheng had moved to the Shanghai Paper Mill were inspected and inventoried. Then, Zheng colluded with the second and third defendants, who came forward and claimed that all the sealed machinery and other items had been sold to Shanghai Paper Mill (the factory they all admitted to jointly operating) by the first defendant in June of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], with the first and third defendants jointly operating it, in an attempt to evade the responsibility of paying off debts. However, it was found that the former Minsheng Yuji Paper Mill was jointly established by the first and second defendants. Although they repeatedly denied it, when Minsheng Yuji Mill contracted with the plaintiff, it was originally stated that Ye Yinshan and Zhang Deming were internally responsible for the share capital, with the first defendant listed as the representative. On this point, not only can Sheng Pihua, the intermediary, and the certifying lawyer Tang Yingsong provide proof, but the judgment to return the factory site to its original condition was issued on May 30th of the 21st year [1932], while the second defendant claimed that the sale occurred in June of the same year. Therefore, according to the judgment, the first defendant, at all costs, concealed assets in order to obstruct creditors, and the first defendant came forward to sign the contract and tried every means to evade responsibility, hoping to stay out of it. Subsequently, he colluded with Zheng Yicheng to delay the execution and assumed a sale of the assets to be executed, intending to conceal them, which clearly constituted the crimes of fraud under Article 363 and concealment of property under Article 384 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Criminal Judge Cai Dingcheng specially opened the third court for trial. The defendants Zheng Yicheng and others also retained lawyer Pan Chenge and others to defend them. First, the plaintiff, Zhao Guanqing, and his son Zhao Yangchun, recounted the previous events. Then, Zheng Yicheng testified, stating that he was 37 years old and from Ningbo. He was asked whether Zhang Deming and Ye Yinshan had shares in the Minsheng Mill, and he replied no. He was asked about the Shanghai Mill, and he replied that Zhang Deming was the manager, Ye was a shareholder, and although he was the factory manager of the Shanghai Mill, he actually had no shares. Next, Ye Yinshan testified, stating that he was 32 years old. He was asked whether he and Zhang Deming had shares in the Minsheng Mill, and he replied that neither of them did. He was asked whether Zheng Yicheng was the sole owner, and he replied yes. He was asked whether he knew about the Shanghai Mill buying the Minsheng Mill's machinery, and he replied that he knew a little about it, because the Minsheng Mill was destroyed by fire, and Zhang Deming was a guarantor, so he bought a portion of the machinery. Finally, Zhang Deming testified, stating that he was 41 years old and the manager of the Shanghai Paper Mill. He was asked whether he had shares in the Minsheng Paper Mill, and he replied no. He was asked who the factory manager was, and he replied Zheng Yicheng. At this point, lawyer Zuo Dedao presented the contract agreement to prove that Zhang Deming was the manager of the Minsheng Mill. The judge read it and questioned Zhang Deming about the actual situation. Zhang replied that when the Minsheng Mill was founded, he helped Zheng Yicheng to liaise with various parties, so he was on the scene. The judge considered the testimony and stated that the case required investigation. Lawyer Zuo rose and requested that the defendants be detained to prevent them from fleeing. As a result, the judge ordered Zheng, Zhang, and Ye to provide a reliable shop guarantee to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Petition the Rickshaw Management Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai rickshaw pullers, in order to urge the implementation of new regulations, strictly enforce rent reductions, appropriately limit registration, and implement relief plans, yesterday sent representatives Bian Qingzhong and others to the Public Concession's Rickshaw Management Committee with a petition. Wang Zhisheng received them and promised to discuss and implement it at the next meeting. The main points of the petition are: (1) The rickshaw rental companies, who have been notified from all sides, currently charge between 12, 13, and 14 cents per shift per day. Given the current economic downturn, this should be reduced to 8 cents. (2) New rickshaws are light, fast, and stable, and should be implemented. (3) Military rickshaw registration is capped at 40,000, but recently, at the request of rickshaw rental companies, the quota has been increased by 10,000, and there is a demand for unlimited numbers, which will likely cause future disputes. The number of rickshaw puller registrations should be appropriately limited. (4) The charitable society's collection of donations from rickshaw pullers amounts to approximately 150,000 yuan over ten months. The used accounts should be settled and announced annually. (5) In ten months, the charitable society has only established two locations. More branch societies should be established. (6) Relief for rickshaw pullers should be provided immediately. Especially during this hot summer, registered rickshaw pullers should be given a straw hat, a pair of straw sandals, and a set of clothing, and tea jars should be provided along the roads, and preventative shots for epidemic diseases should be given. (7) The four rickshaw puller propaganda officers employed by the charitable society should be dismissed. (8) Rickshaw puller new villages, bathhouses, children's schools, hospitals, clubs, and other relief plans should be implemented successively. (9) The thirteen new regulations that have been established and publicly announced should be implemented immediately. (10) Do not accept any recommendations or self-recommendations for rickshaw pullers to participate in the board of directors before the general meeting is held.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Government Receives Provincial Order to Complete Unification of Weights and Measures by Year's End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: The unification of weights and measures is the foundation of all construction. All facilities have a direct or indirect relationship with it. All advanced countries in Europe and America have unified weights and measures as a standard. Their scientific development has also largely occurred after the unification of weights and measures. The importance of weights and measures administration is evident. Since the province was ordered to handle it, it has been five years. Many counties have been able to uphold the central government's intentions and promote the unification of weights and measures as scheduled, but there are also many who have taken a wait-and-see attitude, perfunctorily fulfilled their responsibilities, and have not yet completed it. Such procrastination is inappropriate. It is now set that the end of this year will be the deadline for unification throughout the province. Those who are handling unification should pay close attention to checking the work thoroughly in order to achieve thoroughness. Those who have not yet unified should unify according to the deadline and should not delay any longer, causing inconvenience. In addition, the inspection personnel in the unified counties should pay extra attention to the inspection and examination work, and should also be ordered to help handle other construction matters in a timely manner to avoid idleness. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to the county for compliance.</p>
<h3>Relief Society Sent a Large Number of Refugees Back to Their Hometowns Yesterday, Dispersed in Batches by China Merchants and Other Steamships</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to severe floods and droughts in various provinces, refugees have been unable to make a living and have come to Shanghai to beg for food. However, the Shanghai market is becoming increasingly depressed, and many factories are laying off employees and reducing wages, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed people. It is difficult to stand. It is reported that yesterday afternoon at about two o'clock, more than 300 refugees, emaciated and with their families, gathered at the entrance of Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, pleading with the Drought Relief Society of various provinces to provide relief. The society believes that the dispersal of a large number of refugees in Shanghai will have a significant impact on the safety of residents, and that providing them with appropriate relief will not be helpful. The society decided to issue each person a free steamship ticket and transport them back to their hometowns in batches on commercial ships of China Merchants Bureau, Dada, Datong, Sanbei, and other companies. The refugees boarded ships at the Xin Kaihe and other docks at the 16th Pier yesterday evening at about eight o'clock, escorted by the society's personnel and the Public Security Bureau's police officers. By eleven o'clock, all the ships had weighed anchor and left Shanghai. It is reported that these refugees are all from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Yingkou, and Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>New York Consul's Telegram Reply Regarding the Post-Mortem Examination of Deceased Sailor He Baosheng; No Wounds, Limbs Not Tightly Bound</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: Regarding the case of He Baosheng, a sailor on the Lecksiener [Likely a misspelling of a foreign name] steamship, who died under unclear circumstances, the reporter went to various parties to investigate in order to clarify the truth. It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received two reports from our country's consul in New York, which have provided sufficient clarity regarding the cause of He Baosheng's death. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suspicious Head</p>
<p>According to the previous report from the New York Consul-General, forwarded from the Overseas Chinese newspaper, the body of He Baosheng was found in the area of Nafu [Likely a misspelling of a foreign name]. Since the general company of the ship was located in Liverpool, an order was immediately issued to the consul stationed in Liverpool to investigate. The consul then replied that after the ship owner of Lecksiener investigated twice after the discovery of He Baosheng's body, there was no suspicion of murder. Later, on April 11th of this year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the New York Consul-General to inquire in detail about the circumstances after the discovery of He Baosheng's body. On May 7th, it received a reply from Zhang Zichang, the Deputy Consul of the New York Consulate, who was temporarily in charge of consular affairs, stating that according to the telegram from Dr. Paul J. Parker, the Coroner, on April 11th, when He Baosheng's body was found, it had been eaten by crabs. Because the condition of the head was suspicious, the body was examined. There were no wounds on the outside, or he may have drowned.</p>
<p>Rope Tied on Leg</p>
<p>According to the telegram from the examination enforcer on April 12th, He Baosheng's body was dragged ashore by a well-known small boat. His limbs were not bound, but there was a rope tied on his leg, presumably to drag the body to shore. Later, on the 6th of this month, another report was received from Consul Zhang, stating that the circumstances of He Baosheng's body had been reported. The consulate then sent a letter to the enforcer to ask who was present at the scene when the body was discovered and who witnessed the examination. The reply stated that Cunningham and his son were present at the time and certified that the body's limbs were not bound. There was also a Patterson, who has gone to Filihong [Likely a misspelling of a foreign name]. Because the detailed address was unclear, it was impossible to inquire. In addition, Robin, the current military doctor officer in Washington, was also present at the time.</p>
<p>No Wounds Found During Examination</p>
<p>The consulate immediately sent a letter to the military doctor officer to inquire about the details. On April 28th, the military doctor officer replied, stating that he had examined He Baosheng's body with the coroner on the scene. To the best of his recollection, there were no wounds on the body, and the limbs were not bound. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now sent this report to the Seamen's Union for review. The body of the deceased He Baosheng had no wounds, and the limbs were not bound. The theory of murder is refuted.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Commander Bubei Gengo Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Nippo reported that Bubei Gengo, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, inspected the upper reaches of the Yangtze River aboard the flagship Iwate last month, and returned to Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th. He made the following remarks to Japanese reporters: I inspected the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time, reaching as far as Chongqing. On the way back, when passing through Zhenjiang, I had a meeting with Chen Guofu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is planned that he will go to North China again around the 7th or 8th of next month.</p>
<h3>Boy Shun Gu Kidnapping Case; Kidnapper Captured in Pudong, Victim Also Rescued</h3>
<p>Shun Gu, the eight-year-old son of Ms. Chu Li, a Taizhou woman who runs a baked flatbread shop at No. 5 Yalü Road, disappeared suddenly while playing in a nearby alley at about 9:00 a.m. on the 30th of last month. She had people search for him everywhere to no avail. Between the 4th and 8th of this month, she received three letters with the name "Big Pockmarked Face" claiming that her child was in his possession and that she must prepare 3,000 yuan in silver dollars for ransom, otherwise, he would take drastic measures. He also threatened the father, saying that if he played games, he would use a pistol. Ms. Chu knew that "Big Pockmarked Face" was her fellow villager Sun Baoquan (29 years old), who had worked in her shop last autumn but had been dismissed due to some reason. He had accumulated hatred. Initially, she dared not report it to the police, fearing that her husband would be poisoned. It was not until the 14th that she reported the situation to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The case was investigated by Chinese detective Wang Chengying of the General Inspectorate, who learned that the suspect Sun was hiding at No. 8 Daqing Street, Fukang Road, Pudong. He rushed there the day before yesterday and, together with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau, arrested Sun at the address. Under interrogation, he learned that Chu's child was living with Yao Ajin, a friend of hers, in Yujia Temple, Yangjiadu.

They met Yao on the way, who had heard the news and fled. He took him along with Chu's child across the river to Pudong and brought them to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The captain ordered him to be detained. The child was taken back by his mother. Yesterday, the farm, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court.

He also stated that the defendant said in the police station that the three letters were written at a fortune-telling stall on Huishan Road and would be presented for inspection. Next, Detective Wang reported the process of solving the case. Chu's child said that he was tricked by the defendant into buying candy somewhere and was taken to Pudong. He was beaten from time to time to prevent him from speaking out. There were many wounds on his buttocks and chest, which were presented in court for examination. When questioned, the defendant's confession was vague, saying that there was another person who kidnapped the child. Judge Ye Shengchao ordered that he be remanded and scheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Middle-Aged Woman Throws Herself into the River; Rescue Fails, Joins the Water Gods</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30, the Taikoo Company's Kuai Da [Fast Big] first-class small ferry carried passengers from the Huatong Wharf in Pudong to the company's wharf in Puxi. When the boat reached the center of the river, a middle-aged woman handed a paper package to another man and pretended to go to the stern of the boat to urinate. In that instant, the woman suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. At that time, the boat was sailing very fast, and it was too late to stop the engine and rescue her. The woman died in the river and sank, her whereabouts unknown. The man took the original boat to the Customs Water Police Station to report. He said that his name was Wang Liansheng and he was a waiter at the Zhongnan Hotel in Shanghai. The deceased was about 30 years old and was from Guangdong. He did not know her name, but people called her "Guangdong Lao Wu". He knew a guest in room 503 of the hotel, and today she went to the hotel alone to play. At two o'clock in the afternoon, she asked me to accompany her to the Taikoo Company's Pudong Huatong Wharf to find a friend on the Suzhou boat, but she couldn't find him. We took the Kuai Da small ferry back to Puxi together. On the way, she handed me a paper package containing four photos. One was a picture of the deceased herself, and three were pictures of her husband. She asked me to send it to her sister Shi Aibao's house at No. 35 Maoyi Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, Baike Road. She also asked her sister to prepare two letters and send them to Li Xinglong Cake Shop on Ermalu Road, Guangzhou, and Zhang Yuanlin's house at No. 21 Yijing Lane, Chaozhou, Shantou. After saying this, she excused herself to urinate and suddenly committed suicide. As for why she took this dead end, I don't know. The police station observed that the man in the photos was wearing a suit, and the woman was wearing a black skirt and glasses. The couple looked like intellectuals. The detective ordered her sister to be detained and interrogated.</p>

<h3>Car Crash on Avenue Edward VII; One Car Crashes Through a Wall, Several Dancers Injured</h3>
<p>At 2:45 a.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road in the Public Concession, a No. 12019 yellow taxi, traveling from west to east, collided with a No. 18186 taxi from the Sichuan Taxi Company, traveling from north to south. Both taxis were carrying six or seven dancers and guests. Because they failed to yield to each other, they collided violently. With a crash, the front of the car went straight into the wall of the Wanshenxin Sauce Garden at the corner of the intersection. The foot-thick solid wall suddenly became a large hole. Because it was late at night, the people in the store were awakened from their sleep in shock. When the police arrived, they saw that the people in the car were all frightened. Several dancers were bleeding from their heads, and those who were more seriously injured were immediately sent to the nearby Baolong Hospital for treatment. Those with minor injuries either went to the hospital themselves or went home on their own. Both cars were also damaged, but the drivers were unharmed. Later, Chinese and Western detectives arrived, placed the damaged cars on the side of the road, and called the taxi companies to tow the damaged cars back. The two drivers were taken to the New Chanzha Police Station for questioning. Yesterday morning, the police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to Wanshenxin Sauce Garden to investigate the losses. According to the investigation, the fire-resistant mountain wall at the entrance of the garden was completely damaged and had to be demolished and rebuilt, with an estimated loss of about 50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I read in today's newspaper about the telegram from Xi'an stating that several thousand bales of new cotton from the Shaanxi Cooperatives were shipped to Shanghai but could not be sold due to the impact of provincial currency. They are currently still stored in Shanghai. The stagnation of cotton sales, Shaanxi's only major product, has made it impossible to regulate Shaanxi's finances, especially affecting various cotton cooperatives. After investigation, the cotton shipped to Shanghai by the Shaanxi Cooperatives has been gradually sold, and there is not much left. The above news is not true. Please correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders All Provinces and Cities to Formulate and Implement Compulsory Education Measures</h3>

The Ministry of Education recently issued another order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, ordering the issuance of detailed rules for the implementation of the compulsory education outline. The education departments and bureaus are required to draft detailed implementation measures for all aspects of the compulsory education implementation rules based on the situation in their own provinces and cities, and report them within twenty days of receiving the document for record.</p>
<h3>The Aggressive Implementation of Moral Education in Shandong Province: Fundraising Methods and Budgets Have Been Drafted; Provincial Government Cables the Central Government for Approval</h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Regarding the province's instruction to implement compulsory education, with the establishment of twenty short-term primary schools in each county, totaling more than two thousand schools across the province, and an annual expenditure of 2,868,000 yuan, the preparation and planning have been detailed in previous letters. The Director of Education, He Siyuan, and the Director of Finance, Wang Xiangrong, have complied by drafting a budget and fundraising methods, which have been submitted to the provincial government. The content regarding the budget includes a recurring expenditure of 1,229,040 yuan, a start-up expenditure of 1,578,960 yuan, and a contingency fund of 60,000 yuan. Regarding fundraising, the Departments of Education and Finance have drafted three methods: (1) Military advances from the 18th and 19th years that are to be repaid to each county in the 24th year shall be entirely allocated to compulsory education expenses. (2) The 18th-year military advances that each county should allocate as compulsory education funds. (3) An additional surcharge on head tax (丁銀) will be added in the 24th year, with an additional 2 jiao 6 fen 6 li (角分釐) per tael (兩). The total amount from the above three items is estimated to be 1,854,579 yuan, which meets the Ministry of Education's requirement of raising more than half of the funds provincially. The remaining shortfall of 1,013,421 yuan is proposed to be subsidized by the central government. At the provincial government's political affairs meeting on the 14th, it was noted that although this fundraising was ordered by the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan had repeatedly issued orders prohibiting unauthorized increases in land taxes and surcharges, which is a matter of great importance. Therefore, the provincial government did not dare to make a decision on its own and resolved to cable the Executive Yuan in the name of the provincial government to request instructions for compliance. The proposal and budget from the heads of the financial and educational departments at the provincial government meeting are detailed below.</p>
<p>Proposal: Regarding the establishment of additional short-term primary schools for the implementation of compulsory education in the 24th year, the Executive Yuan, the Beiping Political Readjustment Council, and the Ministry of Education have all sent telegrams to the province, and this government has instructed the Shanxi (山) Financial and Educational Departments to draft appropriate methods. The Ministry of Education has also successively telegraphed the Department of Education to promulgate the "Outline of Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education" and the "Outline of Measures for the Distribution of Central Compulsory Education Funds for the 24th Year," instructing that each county should increase the number of short-term primary schools by at least fifteen to twenty schools, and that more than half of the expenses should be raised by the provinces themselves. Regarding the amount of self-raised funds, instructions were also given to telegraph a response before June 14th. Xiangrong and Siyuan, after consultation, estimated that with the addition of twenty short-term primary schools per county, the total expenditure for the 24th year would be approximately 2,868,000 yuan. The methods for self-raising funds in this province are as follows: (1) Military advances from the 18th and 19th years that are to be repaid to each county in the 24th year shall be entirely allocated to compulsory education expenses, to be remitted to the provincial government by the counties for unified collection and distribution, estimated to yield 432,372 yuan. (2) The 18th-year military advances that each county should allocate as compulsory education funds, those already allocated should also be remitted to the provincial government by the counties for unified collection and distribution, estimated to yield 621,207 yuan. Those not yet allocated shall be strictly ordered by this government to be fully remitted by all counties within a specified period (including the fourteen counties in western Shandong). (3) An additional surcharge on head tax will be added in the 24th year, at a rate of 2 jiao 6 fen 6 li per tael, based on 2 million taels of head tax in the province's 108 counties, estimated to yield 800,000 yuan. The total amount from the above three items is estimated to be 1,854,579 yuan, which meets the requirement of raising more than half of the total amount provincially. The remaining shortfall of 1,013,420 yuan is proposed to be subsidized by the central government to facilitate the implementation. Whether this is appropriate, a summary table of the expenditure estimates for the additional short-term primary schools for the implementation of compulsory education in the 24th year is enclosed for public decision. Proposers: Wang Xiangrong, He Siyuan.</p>

This year's graduating students include eleven in civil engineering and four in mechanical engineering. The commissioners were very impressed with the students' examinations. The school was established more than ten years ago and is jointly run by the Chinese and French governments. It is an innovative institution among national universities and has a long-standing reputation for promoting communication between Chinese and French education and culture. It has sent students to France and Belgium for advanced studies on several occasions, and dozens of them have returned to China to serve in various fields after completing their studies. According to the school's regulations, the top student in each department will be sent to France and Belgium for further study at the school's expense. Moreover, the school's management is strict, and the curriculum and facilities are modeled after the French university system, so graduates become industrial specialists upon graduation.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Maode)</p>
<p>Truth is like an evergreen pine and cypress, a never-ending spring, and an indestructible cell in the human body. Therefore, truth is immortal and infinite. Grasping the truth can have the magic of turning white hair back to red, while deviating from the truth, even a living person becomes a walking corpse.</p>
<p>When we plan to do something, we should do it immediately. We must never miss the opportunity. If we wait until the time has passed, it will be too late to engage in it. Many people delay their lives in complacency. By the time they grow old, it is too late to work hard.</p>
<p>When the sun rises, I walk west; when the sun sets, I walk east. This is my life. Life tells me not to look back, but to look forward. However, I am always a person who cannot even see my own shadow!</p>
<h3>Scalping</h3>
<p>— Yao Fu</p>
<p>Each industry has its own "terminology"; especially the "lingo" of the petty ruffians and hooligans is particularly abundant. "Lingo" is synonymous with "terminology," but it carries some mystery and is similar to riddles and euphemisms. Terminology is a specialized noun. For example, the hooligans' terms for old widows, old crabs, nail tips, pretending to be fools, etc., are all different from the lawyers' terms for legal benefits, inheritance, quasi-incompetent, provisional attachment, etc. Aren't they all "terminology"?</p>
<p>"Scalping" is a specialized term shared by two industries. The scalping of petty ruffians is called "throwing top hats" or "catching turtles," and is generally an illegal act, like "pulling yellow cows" – pulling rickshaws across bridges – and "recording pig roe." Scalping by friends in the exchange involves skimming some profits. These are not the small-time thugs who "throw top hats," and have all the common sense.</p>
<p>The exchange is a legally sanctioned public casino. You shout loudly that "all industries are sluggish and it is not easy to make a living," which is simply foolish—whether it is short-selling or long-buying for three to five million, earning ten to twenty thousand is as easy as picking up a mustard seed. It is also easy for small clerks to do some scalping and earn ten or twenty yuan a day.</p>
<p>What is "scalping"? When friends on the exchange market hear some news—actually, it is equal to a rumor—and the price rises or falls accordingly, this is a wonderful opportunity for "scalping." Fleetingly, friends with nimble hands—called brokers or agents in the exchange—seize the opportunity, adding fuel to the fire and or selling fifty thousand, or buying a hundred thousand. Seeing that there is a cent or two of profit to be made, they settle at the current or next session. At least they can get fifty yuan or one to two hundred yuan, which is nothing rare.</p>
<p>Think about it, the exchange is open four sessions a day, and each session has fourteen or five categories, each with a minimum of two or three prices and a maximum of more than twenty prices. Isn't the daily income of the "reaching generals" in the exchange "bucks" "bucks"?—The exchange is of course especially "bucks" "bucks."</p>
<p>Because it is easy to make money, going to dances, dog racing, gambling wildly, and whoring excessively is not a big deal. And sharp-minded friends transform into wealthy men. However, taking concubines, building Western-style houses, and sitting in cars are always unavoidable, no matter how clever and stingy a friend you are. Because Mencius said long ago, "Food and sex are human nature."</p>
<p>"All industries are sluggish and it is not easy to make a living." What absurd and unfounded words.</p>
<h3>Boating</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Four people came out of the Wu Family Restaurant after having a meal, and then spent twenty cents at the bridgehead to buy a basket of loquats, a local product of Nanxiang, insisting on falsely claiming they were "White Sands" from Dongting Mountain. The peddler's shallow deception is truly infuriating. In fact, there's no need to blame the people of the interior; how are the so-called wealthy merchants in the city any different in their use of deceptive tricks?</p>
<p>We arrived at "North Sea," which is just a river. The boatmen call this river the "Nanxiang Port," which connects to "Shanghai" on one side and "Jiading" on the other. Boats carrying kiln goods, onions, vegetables, and livestock come and go all day and night, making the river surface very lively. There are dog barks, rooster crows, children's cries, and the laughter of men and women.</p>
<p>We envied the life on the water, so we hired two small boats. Zhu Shaofei and I rowed one boat together, while Wang Zhuo and Liu Chunhua rowed the other. An old woman steered our boat from the stern, making a "clink, clink" sound. The water separated and then came back together on our oars, separating and rejoining again and again. In this way, our small boat gradually rowed out of Nanxiang Town, and we saw dense tree shade, green bamboo, thatched huts, and fences made of thorns on the shore.</p>
<p>Wang Zhuo's boat was initially in front of us, but we soon overtook them, and they fell behind by about ten feet. Liu Chunhua took off his coat and rowed hard to catch up with us. Zhu Shaofei said, "We must keep moving forward, forward!" Thus, a competitive situation arose between the two boats unintentionally. This is just like society and life; the way of society and life is competitive, it is a duel, and therefore, the times are progressing.</p>
<p>Raindrops fell from the black clouds in the sky, and countless circles swirled on the river surface. Our progress was hindered, and we listened to the boatwoman's advice and temporarily rowed under a tree shade to avoid the wind and rain. The river surface suddenly became silent, with only the "beep beep" sound of rain in the bushes. We rowed our two boats close together, as if preparing to resist some kind of attack. We turned up the collars of our coats and leisurely began to smoke.</p>
<h3>The Sky of the Future!</h3>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: A Special Enlightenment: Westerners Discuss Construction, But Regrets Remain; Ten Kinds of Longing</p>
<p>After he said this, he looked directly at Beihai. Beihai's face was turned that way, so Zhiqian couldn't see his expression. However, his footsteps initially seemed to want to move forward, but soon he retreated backward again. He stood still, not saying anything. The girl Yueying's dark eyes were darting around busily. Her body seemed to be stuck to the wooden door frame, leaning against it tightly. Thus, the two people didn't move for about ten minutes. Beihai seemed to be unable to bear it and stretched his knee, lunging forward. Yueying, who originally hadn't seemed like she would move, suddenly recoiled backward because of Beihai's reckless movement. Beihai took a few steps forward and saw that she had retreated and turned away, so he paused, stunned. However, after Yueying retreated inside the door, she didn't immediately leave but turned her eyes and smiled slightly at Beihai. Just then, voices were heard from the courtyard, Yueying answered, and then went inside. Beihai was very flustered by this and immediately walked out of the alley. Zhiqian stopped looking and quickly went from the back door of Little Western Heaven to the main gate, and then from the street at the gate, he turned onto the side street. After only turning the corner and passing two houses, he met Beihai head-on. Beihai was walking forward with his eyes straight ahead, as if he hadn't seen Zhiqian coming. Zhiqian had no choice but to stop and call him several times. Only then did he stop, his face red, and bow to Zhiqian, saying: "Mr. Cheng, are you out for a walk?" Zhiqian said: "Yes, I was bored in the hotel. Why haven't you come for tutoring these past two days?" Beihai smiled: "How can I keep letting Mr. Cheng fulfill his obligations?" Zhiqian said: "Your words are too polite and meaningless. If I don't fulfill my obligations, can't I still collect your nine dollars a month tuition?" (242)</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance, Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>taking turns to play. This kind of delicate music was already very pleasant to listen to, but now on the water, with the gentle sound of the wind mixed with the jade-like sound of the water, it felt especially refreshing and pleasing to the ear. Although the notes were not particularly high, the more subtle and gentle they were, the more they stirred the heart and soul, making one feel very comfortable. And what were those two small boats for? They were like two kitchens on the water, carrying several small stoves and a group of eunuchs specially assigned to cooking, in order to prepare the Empress Dowager's lunch properly; this was what she had ordered in advance.</p>
<p>Li Lianying was still the same as before; no matter what the Empress Dowager did, whether it was a formal court ceremony or an ordinary banquet, he was always the chief commander in charge of everything. Naturally, he was indispensable on the lake tour. Zhang De, the chief eunuch in charge of tea and refreshments, also accompanied her on the imperial boat with two of his junior eunuchs. The Empress Dowager herself still sat in her throne with utmost dignity, with us standing respectfully on both sides.</p>
<p>"Ah! Coming to this morning, it can truly be said to be the ultimate in delightful and pleasing sights!" The Old Buddha said in a very gentle tone, praising as if talking to herself and as if speaking to us: "Therefore, one must not be solely busy with official business, but must set aside sufficient time for recreation."</p>
<p>Every minute, even every second, was very precious and joyful for her old self; she didn't dare to slack off at all, preparing to use all the time to enjoy herself to the fullest. Just looking at the expression revealed on her face, one could see it very clearly.</p>
<p>There was also a special decoration on the imperial boat that was not commonly seen outside: originally, on the central pole, it couldn't really be called a mast, because there was no need to hang any sails at all; it would be more appropriate to call it a flagpole. Apart from hanging a very large and beautiful dragon flag, there were also two long, narrow streamers, which were two sky-blue satin ribbons, blowing backward towards the stern of the boat with the wind. These two streamers were indeed too long; they could float all the way to the surface of the water, skimming over the wake left by the boat, swirling out countless circular patterns. Moreover, because they were already soaked in water, whenever the sunlight shone on them, they were truly as beautiful as a rainbow. (342)</p>

<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Tofu</h3>
<p>— Nanggong Sheng</p>
<p>Tofu is an item that contains many nutrients. Eating it is both hygienic and beneficial to the body. It is an affordable and high-quality food, the most popular and beneficial food for the common people. As the weather gradually heats up, the dishes used daily should not be too greasy, causing the stomach to feel stuffy and bloated. There must be a refreshing and delicious food to suit the taste of summer, and tofu is the most suitable. Because tofu is a refreshing, tender and light food, as long as it is cooked properly, it can be made into many flavors of dishes and soups. Compared with delicacies from mountains and seas, it still feels more refreshing and incomparable to tofu.</p>
<p>Tofu comes in two types, old and soft. The old is harder than the soft. In the north, the tofu is all old tofu, a block like white stone, and you can use a scale hook to weigh the tofu on it. The hardness can be imagined. Suzhou has a kind of water tofu, which is kept in water and is even more tender than soft tofu. You have to use a spoon to take it out, similar to tofu pudding. Regardless of hard, old, soft, or watery tofu, all kinds of tofu can be made into delicious dishes and soups. The following are the tofu foods most suitable for summer.</p>
<p>Egg Tofu Pudding Use one egg to mix, mash forty cents worth of soft tofu, mix with the egg, first use one hundred dried shrimps, soak them in wine, cook the juice in a rice bowl, wait for the umami flavor of the dried shrimps to be exhausted before putting it into the soup, pour it out for later use, put a little lard in the pot and heat it until red, pour in the tofu mixed with the egg, slightly fry it, and it will become lumpy, then pour the dried shrimp juice into the pot, add salt, cooking wine, and MSG each a little, cover the pot and boil, until the tofu and eggs coagulate, and this delicious egg tofu pudding is made, the taste is fresh and plump, more than several times better than the chicken beans in Sichuan restaurants, and the price is extremely cheap, less than ten cents, it is truly a popular tofu food.</p>
<p>Fermented Bean Curd Dew Stewed Tofu Use half a bowl of fermented bean curd dew, add three pieces of soft tofu and mash them, add a little salt, cooking wine, and steam over water until the tofu coagulates. It is another extraordinarily fresh and refreshing vegetarian tofu. It is best to eat it in summer. It is a pity that fermented bean curd dew is not easy to get in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Pan-Fried Tofu Pan-fried tofu is a famous dish in Beijing-Sichuan restaurants. Cut old tofu into square pieces of about an inch in size and about two or three points thick, coat with egg white, put them in a lard pot and fry them on both sides until golden brown, add dried shrimp, MSG, soy sauce, cooking wine, white sugar, and a water scoop, cover the pot and cook over high heat until transparent, until the water is almost dry and the soup is thick, then the fresh juice of dried shrimp and MSG has penetrated into the tofu, and this delicious pan-fried tofu is made.</p>
<p>Raw Salt Tofu Add soy sauce, sesame oil or chili oil to a piece of raw tofu and mix it well. It becomes an incomparably refreshing raw salt tofu, which is a delicious dish to eat with wine or porridge. However, the soy sauce must be good, preferably shrimp soy sauce or mother oil. It is even better if dried shrimp and shredded ham are added and mixed together.</p>
<p>Stewing tofu with sauce, green onions, and white sugar results in an extremely rich and delicious flavor. However, the sauce must be homemade bean sauce for the best flavor, as it is fresh and pure. It is even more wonderful if chili oil and dried shrimp are added. It is a refreshing dish among summer foods. There are also many kinds of tofu foods, such as tofu soup, shrimp, crab roe tofu, and first-class tofu, all of which are extremely delicious dishes and soups. However, compared with the ones mentioned above, the prices are all expensive and not as popular as before.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of My Friend Mr. Wang</h3>
<p>— Junmou</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Wang, is from Beijing and possesses some assets. His father passed away early, and his mother is already in her fifties. He graduated from a polytechnic university and once worked as an engineer in Shanghai. He has a girlfriend, Miss Li, who is intelligent, versatile, and particularly healthy. Mr. Wang has always admired her. One day, Mr. Wang suddenly received a telegram from home urging him to return. When he arrived home, he learned that his mother, due to her age, was particularly eager for him to marry and have grandchildren. Because Mr. Wang was too cautious in choosing a spouse, he had not yet married. Now, his mother was implementing a forced marriage system, arranging for Miss Jiang from the same county to be his wife. She had used a pretext to telegraph him home in advance and had already chosen a day for the wedding. Mr. Wang could not bear to go against his mother's wishes again and had to bow his head and obey, completing the marriage. His wife, Miss Jiang, was indeed beautiful and healthy, and she had also graduated from medical university. Mr. Wang was happy to have such a good partner. Following his mother's orders, he stayed at home and needed to find a job in Shanghai. He took a position as an engineer at a factory in Beijing. After several years, he lost contact with his friends in the South, and Miss Li had also married. Later, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and Beijing declined daily. Mr. Wang resigned again and moved south to Shanghai, where he worked as a road engineer. He lived in a rented house with his elderly mother and beautiful wife. Jiang was also hired by a hospital to work as a gynecologist. While Mr. Wang was sorting through his closet, he accidentally found a portrait that Miss Li had given him in the past. He couldn't help but recall their past relationship and wanted to find out about her current situation. He showed it to his wife, saying, "This is Miss Li, a girlfriend I admired. I haven't heard from her for a long time." A few days later, while Jiang was seeing patients, she met a sick woman who looked haggard and seemed familiar. She found it very strange. Looking at the registration form, it was written "Shi, nee Li." Examining her condition, she had purulent leucorrhea. Because it had been delayed for a long time, it had affected her whole body, and her face was sallow and emaciated. Jiang immediately instructed her to have daily injections of the prescription to treat her whole-body diseases and also told her to go to the Tongren Pharmacy at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinjiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, to buy a box each of external leucorrhea medicine and internal leucorrhea pills, two yuan per box, and to take them as instructed. While Mr. Wang and his wife were chatting, they mentioned this matter. When Wang heard "nee Li," his heart stirred, and he seemed to sense something. Jiang saw this and suddenly realized, "The sick woman in the photo you showed me looks just like her. I should ask her about it for you." The next day, Shi, nee Li, came for a follow-up visit, and her condition had improved. After Jiang finished treating her, she asked, "Do you know someone named Wang from Beijing?" The sick woman was surprised and said, "I do know him, but I haven't heard from him for a long time." Jiang said, "Wang is family." She then arranged a date to invite Mr. and Mrs. Shi and several friends for a meal at Mr. Wang's house. From then on, Shi and Wang became friends, and Jiang and Li loved each other like sisters. Shi had a deep-seated venereal disease, which Jiang introduced her to the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, for appropriate treatment. Before long, both recovered their health.</p>

<h3>Financial: August Futures Market: Gold Market Supply and Demand Remains Idle; Indian Silver Continues to Contract, Stimulating Buying; Initial Stability Followed by Firmness, Resulting in a Rally</h3>
<p>Yesterday's August gold market was characterized by a lack of enthusiasm and scattered sentiment. With the transaction tax issue unresolved, major players continued to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The morning session was extremely flat, while the afternoon session saw a turnaround driven by the continued decline in Indian silver prices, which disappointed short sellers and stimulated buying interest. The morning began with a slight increase in overseas silver markets in London and stable prices in the United States. Deferred silver prices in Monte Carlo fell slightly by five cents to one and a half cents. Exchange rates saw a minor contraction. Spot gold in London rose by one penny. Reports of the Italian government nationalizing silver and prohibiting private possession of silver coins stabilized sentiment. Although pre-market trading opened with bids of 67.70 to 67.80 yuan, buying was more active, leading to a steady trend. Considering swap rates, the market was relatively stable compared to the previous Saturday. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with no change in both British and American rates. The customs gold unit rose by one cent, and the standard price for gold tenders increased to 835 yuan, with little impact. Immediately after opening, the market consolidated. The Bank of China offered shillings, causing a slight decline, but major players took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official rates for both British and American currencies would remain unchanged. Soon, the tide gradually rose, and exchange rates also tightened slightly. Buyers became more active and pushed prices above the 70 yuan level. However, banks took advantage of the higher prices to offer gold, temporarily halting the rise. Thereafter, sentiment became mediocre, and both buyers and sellers remained silent, resulting in a sluggish market with limited fluctuations, indicating an extremely idle situation that was difficult to stir up any significant activity. The afternoon session continued to be characterized by inactivity. The market only opened at 2:30 PM. Upon opening, the report of a 15 anna contraction in Indian silver prices stimulated buying interest, pushing prices above the 70 yuan level and rapidly rising. Banks took advantage of the higher prices to offer gold, leading to a period of consolidation after the initial surge. Later, the report of a second decline in Indian silver prices by another 2.3 annas further boosted sentiment, and the market closed higher again. Swap spreads narrowed, decreasing to as low as five cents, eventually settling around 1.5 yuan. A lack of short positions left buyers seemingly alarmed. The market conditions for the day are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 768.5 yuan, down 2.1 yuan from the previous Saturday. Taking swap rates into account, the overall trend was flat. Fuxingyong, Qingfa, Yongna offered, rose to 8.8 yuan. Dda, Hui Xiang, Hengyu, Dadecheng sold. The Bank of China offered the first half of the August shilling at 6.25, retreating to 7.7 yuan. Houchang, Yongdafa, Yongxiang, Fuyu, Chengluo called for purchase, rising to 8.8 yuan. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official rates for both British and American currencies would remain unchanged. Macali offered spot US dollars at 0.0625, still consolidating. Later, Fuxingyong, Hongkang, Yongshunmao, and Hengyu stepped in, and the price rose to 0.05. Macali offered August US dollars at 0.25, Dadecheng and Huixiang sold, retreating to 69.3 yuan. At this point, there was still a rebound. Later, the Bank of England offered July shillings at 0.75, Jiatai, Rongting, Qianchangxiang slightly sold, Fuduo sold, and the price dropped from 70.3 yuan to 68.7 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongfuyu, and Fuxingyong stepped in, rising to 9.6 yuan. Macali offered June US dollars at 0.9375, Shunli sold, retreating to 9.1 yuan. Qingfa, Yongpai held, and the noon close was at 769.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened at 769 yuan (at 1:32 PM). Indian silver was reported down 15/16 annas. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, and Dafa Yong immediately moved to 72.7 yuan. Yicheng and Yiyu sold flat, retreating to X yuan and 2 cents. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Jiarun, Chunyuan, and Yongzhuxing Yong stepped in again, rising to 3.3 yuan. Macali offered spot US dollars at 0.9375, Hengyu, Yingxiang, and Fuxingyong sold, falling to 1.4 yuan. Dadecheng, Dafa Yong, and Wanfeng continued to step in, rising again to 4 yuan. Shenfeng and Fuyu took advantage of the high prices to sell slightly, retreating to 2.6 yuan. Dafa Yong, Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Hengchangyong, and Dadecheng collectively purchased, Indian silver declined a second time by a small amount, 2.3 annas, rising to 4.7 yuan. Yingxiang and Yifengyong and Fuyu sold, falling to 4 yuan. Hengxing vigorously purchased, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmao Yong also stepped in, rising again to 5.2 yuan, and the closing price was 775 yuan. After the close, Hengxing suddenly came in with aggressive sales, causing a slight decline. It was found that the highest price of the day was 775.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 767.7 yuan, with a fluctuation of 7.5 yuan. As a result, it rose 4.4 yuan compared to the previous swap rate. Adding the swap rate, the increase was more than that.</p>
<p>The settlement price was set at the Central Bank's tendered gold price, which was listed as 835 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 60 yuan, which was approximately 4 yuan weaker than the previous Saturday. The July registration was 771 yuan, the August registration was 769 yuan, the morning supplement was 771 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was 777 yuan. The price of pure gold was approximately 10 yuan, at 778.5 yuan. The spot market was flat, and swap rates turned cheaper. The water price was slightly lower. Tianjin goods were approximately 14 yuan, and pure gold was approximately 20 yuan, all with limited transactions.</p>
<p>Swap rates yesterday turned cheaper due to a lack of short positions, with the long side showing signs of panic. The lowest reached 5 cents, eventually settling around 1.5 yuan, creating an uncertain situation. This was mainly because trading was limited, making it difficult to find a counterpart. Initially, Hengyu and others offered Shunmao at 2.3 yuan. Soon, multiple parties gathered, and Yingfeng, Hengshunmao, Dadecheng, Shunli, Fuxingyong, etc., all joined in, pushing the price down due to a lack of short positions in the market. Yuantai offered Dadecheng seven orders, and the price dropped to 5 cents. Later, Fuxingyong came up to offer, but it lacked long positions, and the price rose again. At noon, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, etc., offered, raising it to 1.5 yuan. The trading in the afternoon session was average. Yuanmao Yong, Shunmaosheng, and Dda slightly offered, and Hengyu and Wanxing offered 1.5 yuan. Dadecheng offered Ddacheng fourteen orders at 1.4 yuan, and the situation has stabilized. There are 3,920 orders that have not been properly swapped in July, with 25 long parties and 15 short parties.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was limited, with Dafa Yong, Jinlong, Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong, Richang, Yuanting, and Dda being mainly on the buying side. Fuyu, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yuxinxiang, Yiyu, and Hengxing were mainly on the selling side. Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, and Yingxiang advanced first and then exited. Huixiang, Shunmao, Chunyuan Yong, and Wanfeng exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang, Wanxing, jointly made more than 400 orders, hedging more than 200 orders. Shunli jointly made more than 400 orders, hedging slightly. The Guangdong gang, Shenggda, slightly sold. Hengxing entered more than 300 orders and exited 400 orders. The new August chips totaled 12,656, with 51 long parties and 52 short parties. The total number of transactions was 12,145 in the morning and 12,020 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Silver Ingot Continues to Shrink; Foreign Exchange Wants to Loosen But Remains Tight</h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London large bar rose nearly 0.0625, New York silver price remained unchanged, and Montevideo forward silver price slightly fell by 0.005 to 0.015. London gold rose 0.1, British pound against the US dollar shrank by 0.0375, British pound against the French franc remained unchanged, US dollar against the British pound remained unchanged, and US dollar against the French franc rose by 0.05. The exchange market opened in the morning near the asking price, with British pound at 1 shilling and 8 pence, and US dollar at 41.1875 yuan, compared to last Saturday, the British pound up by 0.0625, and US hard currency up by 0.05. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both British pound and US dollar unchanged, and the Customs Gold Unit rose by 0.01, calming sentiment slightly. After opening, the market still showed some fluctuation. The Bank of China supplied British pounds, but banks also had counter-transactions, allowing it to be maintained. It was expected that HSBC's posted rates would be announced, with both British pound and US dollar unchanged. After that, Chinese merchants had a slight buying appetite, and the process became tighter. However, because banks still had a selling appetite, the final situation stabilized, lacking special developments. There was a lack of trading in the aftermarket. The market stabilized in the morning session. Later, when the Indian silver was reported to be down by 0.015 anna, Chinese merchants rushed to buy, causing the market to tighten further. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to supply, and the market still fluctuated. Later, when the second Indian silver price was reported, it was down again by 0.015 anna. The Sin Fung Company also came to buy, causing the market to tighten again. By the close of trading, the asking price for near-term British pound was 1 shilling, 7 pence, 8125 and 875, and the US dollar was 40.875 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was tighter by 0.09375, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.1875. Chinese merchants were eager to buy, but the amount was not large. Banks still had a strong selling appetite. The transaction prices for today will be recorded below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market, Easy to Fall and Difficult to Rise; Turmoil Arises Again in the "23rd Customs Bonds"; Bulls Slightly Cash Out on "96 Bonds"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, because the situation in Hebei remained deadlocked and people's hearts were still uneasy, coupled with the fact that the general public was deeply deceived by reckless remarks, they generally held the principle of selling at high prices. Therefore, as soon as the market price rose slightly, it was suppressed by pressure. Therefore, it is difficult to be optimistic about the market situation. Yesterday, the market initially showed some progress, but eventually failed due to the above-mentioned reasons. The market closed with a renewed decline due to rumors, falling several cents to about one yuan again. It is easy to fall and difficult to rise, which is a true reflection of the current bond market. The trend and future will eventually have a turnaround, but it will inevitably be short and fleeting. Yesterday, the market for "96 Bonds" also saw a decline of 30 to 40 cents due to bulls cashing out, following the trend. The "23rd Year Customs Bonds" suddenly experienced violent turmoil. Initially, large quantities were absorbed at 54, 53, and 48 successively, and the market price rose sharply by one and a half yuan. People's hearts were shaken, and it was rumored that the bulls had organized again for the bonds, and the atmosphere suddenly tightened. It seemed that the turmoil of February was reappearing today. Later, however, the bulls took advantage of the situation and large quantities of No. 54 were resold, and the market price suddenly fell back by more than one yuan. The sudden rise and fall still had its reasons. It is said that a certain party had a real shortage of goods and wanted to pay taxes, but the market price was low, so they created this kind of atmosphere to raise the market price in order to cash out. Under the influence of this wave, the future turmoil in the market will not be immediately suppressed. However, the general public has learned from the past, so it will definitely not cause the kind of frenzy that occurred in January. This can be said with certainty. Yesterday, the total transaction volume was 18,818,700 yuan, of which the "23rd Customs Bonds" accounted for a huge 4.5 million yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises for Eight Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>According to Sin Fung Company reports, the New York stock market rose again yesterday (the 15th). This is the eighth consecutive day of rising. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also set a high record since 1931. American canned goods and various stocks all reached new highs for the year. Silver stocks alone fell, because everyone believes that the Ministry of Finance is now slow to purchase silver, and there is no hope of raising the price of new mined silver for the time being. Small exchange stocks also rose, and the bond market was firm. Trading was still active. Half-day trading volume was 580,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Yarn Continues to Dump, Local Yarn is Severely Affected; Downturn Resumes After the "Thousands"; Prices Fall by More Than One Yuan in Each Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The situation is extremely pessimistic because foreign yarn is frequently falling in price and being dumped on the market. As a result, people's hearts are shaken and Chinese yarn is severely affected. As for this month, due to the impact of economic recession, those who receive the goods feel it is especially difficult. Therefore, the market sentiment is quite weak.</p>
<p>Kim Chee Foreign Firm Massively Sells Off</p>
<p>The market for tagged yarn opened in the morning. Because it was reported that the incident in Chahar had been peacefully resolved, some shorts covered their positions and bulls actively bought. The market was able to maintain itself. As a result, prices for each month rose 10 cents compared to the previous day's closing price, and long-term contracts remained unchanged. When the market opened in the afternoon, it suddenly fell, and the decline became more intense. This was because foreign firms were selling off in large quantities. Another theory is that foreign yarn is being sold at a discount in the market, and the price of cloth is even lower than the price of yarn. Therefore, foreign firms are extremely pessimistic about tagged yarn, and the pressure is particularly strong. As a result, prices for each month fell by one yuan to one yuan and thirty cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 400 bales of Gilfillan were sold, 200 bales of Dah Foong, 600 bales of Yi Da, 700 bales of Dah Foong, 4,000 bales of Shen Kee, 400 bales of Yee Cheng, 450 bales of Da Kee, 400 bales of Chang Yue, 400 bales of Da Chang Cheng, 550 bales of Tong Ho, and 800 bales of Hsin Cheng. 800 bales of Gilfillan were bought, 1,600 bales of Ruey Dah, 500 bales of Da Chang, 400 bales of Ren, 1,100 bales of Yi Da, 800 bales of Yu Da, 1,150 bales of Ming Teh, 1,000 bales of Lun Hong, and 450 bales of Hsin Hwa. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>June Yarn/Cotton Clearing</p>

<h3>Cotton: Difficult to Recover; Although There is a Bullish Sentiment... What a Pity for the Heavy Cotton Stock</h3>
<p>The cotton market's atmosphere these days is that general cotton merchants have turned from short to long and are thinking of going long. There is talk of taking delivery of goods and squeezing the shorts this month. However, heavy cotton stocks are a fact that is very oppressive and difficult to reverse. In addition, the yarn market is falling, and factories have no appetite for raw cotton. The future of old cotton is still not optimistic.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Fell Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The tagged cotton market opened in the morning. Because the American and Indian cotton markets were rising, some people had a bullish outlook, and Ruey Dah bought up short positions. The market sentiment rose. As a result, this month's price remained unchanged from the previous day's closing price, and long-term contracts rose by 10 cents. The market suddenly fell when it opened in the afternoon because the yarn market had fallen sharply, and all areas had received timely rain, which greatly benefited the cotton fields. In addition, there was a sufficient supply of old cotton, and the factory currency was cut off. As a result, the selling trend resumed, and the seven and eight-month contracts broke through the one-yuan mark again. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 20 cents to 35 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,700 dan of Shen Kang were sold, 2,100 dan of Shen Chang, 1,300 dan of He Hsing, 1,000 dan of Tong Foo, 1,000 dan of Chun Chang, 1,300 dan of Shen Kee, 2,700 dan of Yi Chang, 1,100 dan of Da Chang, 3,600 dan of Lun Hong, 1,000 dan of Niu Yuan, and 1,500 dan of Yi Kang. 1,700 dan of Gilfillan were bought, 4,700 dan of Da Foong, 1,000 dan of He Hsing, 2,500 dan of Ruey Dah, 1,100 dan of Yi Kang, 1,500 dan of Chin Chang, 3,600 dan of Tai Hsing, 1,700 dan of Yi Chang, and 2,100 dan of Chang Foong. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Type | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>August Futures | 31.90 | 30.70 | 30.70 | Down 0.20 | 75,800</p>

<p>Current Cotton Sales Only Involved Bales That Had Not Yet Been Opened</p>
<p>The current cotton sales market showed no improvement. The factories' appetite for goods was closed, and transactions only involved bales that had not yet been opened. There were 320 bales of Jiayuan Yao cotton and 150 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rain Brings Down Rice Prices Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 27 shipments of rice from Southern Shanghai (a total of more than 5,000 piculs) arrived. Since the heavy rain the day before, the market situation has been discouraging and the sales market has not improved. Therefore, prices for all goods have plummeted. Although the weather may be sunny and dry, it is unlikely to change color within these one or two days. Prices for all thick japonica rice have fallen by 30 to 40 cents. Although more than 300 packages of late rice from Qinhuangdao were sold, the price drop was not small. The price of Bian Yin Yuan was cut by 20 cents, similar to the price of Du Chien. (Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, although there were few ships from various routes on the lower reaches of the river, because there had been moldy rain of two to three inches in various inland areas, people's hearts were down and the appetite for all goods was lonely. The market price of white japonica rice fell by 20 to 30 cents, and early thin rice also fell by 20 cents. The other goods also fell by nearly 10 cents. However, the arrival and sale of white rice were both good, and the price situation was stable.</p>
<p>Foreign rice was originally in a gradual stage of recovery, but the heavy rain that penetrated everywhere the day before stabilized the minds of farmers in the interior. Yesterday, the inland area's sales were weak, and the market had a sharp downturn. However, the sales from Zhejiang were reduced, while the areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and Jiujiang and Hankou, as well as this street, all inquired about small quantities. Therefore, the market did not experience a huge drop. The high-quality foreign rice all fell by 4, 5, or 6 points. However, due to the shortage of stock and arrivals, Ke Xian rice was still able to hold its ground. The total daily openings were 6,500 packages of Saigon rice, 1,000 packages of small-pattern rice, 1,000 packages of Siam transport rice Su japonica rice, and over 400 packages of Ke Xian, including over 200 packages of Wenzhou rice and Sha City rice. Ke Xian was sent inland, while the other foreign rice was distributed to the various groups. The aftermarket is temporarily stable, but if the weather turns sunny yesterday and it does not continue to rain, then the market price will not easily fall.</p>
<h3>Rain Not Thorough; Flour and Wheat Fall and Then Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a consistent decline in prices across all months. When prices opened, foreign wheat prices were reported to be low, and since all areas had received good rain after a long drought, people's hearts were naturally greatly comforted. Therefore, after prices opened, the market immediately saw a setback, falling about 3 points compared to the previous week's closing price. At that time, there was active short covering, while the factories' selling became increasingly strong. Jin Bang also bought near-term contracts, resulting in a stable trend in the following trading. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions had cleared, and both sides were watching. Because the rain, although it had been seen, was still felt to be insufficient, the selling became average and the market showed a state of rejection. If the weather continues to be smooth in the future, then people's hearts will not easily be fixed. As a result, the price for this month fell 7.5 points, the price for July fell 3 points, the price for August fell 4 points, the price for September and October fell 2.7 points, and the price for November fell 1 point.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw a weak market for each month's market, with foreign wheat prices being quoted at 3 to 4 cents lower in Chicago and 8 cents to 1 point lower in Canada. After the market opened, the prices were dampened by the rain the day before. As people say, "a great drought meets the clouds," which greatly comforts people's hearts. The price for July immediately showed weakness, falling 5 to 6 points compared to the previous week. After that, both sides rejected each other and there were few people coming in and out. When the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market had not fallen sharply, and the inland areas were still dry. Therefore, the selling became sparse and people's hearts gradually recovered. However, after a long drought, the rain provided temporary peace of mind. As a result, the price for July fell 4 points, the price for August fell 6 points, and the price for September and October fell 5 points. The spot wheat market is still stable for high-quality goods, while medium-quality goods are lower by 2 to 3 points. It is said that wheat from Guandian, Linhuai Pass, and Mingguang is 3 yuan and 45 cents; wheat from Hankou Kunyou is 3 yuan and 26 cents; wheat from Chuzhou is 3 yuan and 42 cents; wheat from Shuangfeng is 3 yuan and 32 cents; wheat from Taiping is 3 yuan and 21 cents; wheat from Yangzhou is 2 yuan and 35 cents; wheat from Penglai is 3 yuan and 32 cents; wheat from Zhitang and Zhitang is 3 yuan and 33 cents; wheat from Wusong is 3 yuan and 31 cents; and wheat from Danyang Gaozi is 3 yuan and 27 cents. Fuxin sold 10,000 packages, Shenda sold 3,000 packages, Fufeng sold 1,000 packages, and Xinda sold 500 packages.</p>
<p>Unless the current extremely good harvest situation in overseas wheat markets changes, prices will eventually find it difficult to rise and not fall.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat | June 14 | June 15 | Change</p>

<h3>Soybean Meal Report; Soybean Prices Move Again</h3>
<p>The situation for soybean oil and bean cake has been poor due to unfavorable conditions in various aspects and frequent declines in the Dalian soybean market. The market transactions have been sporadic and the overall market price has actually collapsed. Now that telegrams are reporting price increases, the standard market situation has jumped. This has given the atmosphere in the spot market a sense of activity, and there may be a situation in the future where prices fall sharply but have small rebounds. Yesterday's total city transactions were eight to nine carloads of soybeans, over one hundred pieces of soybeans from local factories, eight hundred pieces of peanut oil, and over ten thousand pieces of various brands of bean cake.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sudden Increase in Heilongjiang and Hankou Wood Ear Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Recently, the Heilongjiang and Hankou offices have reported a shortage of wood ear inventory, and there is no new supply to replace the old. The market has suddenly seen a price rebound. It was found that the Hankou market recently had 70% to 80% new wood ear priced at 94 yuan and 80 cents. According to telegrams yesterday, the price suddenly rose to 100 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. Currently, old goods are out of stock, so they are becoming increasingly tight. The current market price here is 112 yuan for Aviation Brand wood ear, an increase of 6 to 7 yuan. Other miscellaneous wood ears have also increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Swire Sugar Becomes Easier to Obtain After Being Rejected For a Long Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw no improvement in sales and remained sluggish. The association's opening price for Grade 24 Fine White sugar was 16 yuan for spot goods and 5 yuan and 10 cents for transit goods, but no transactions were made. This store's loan was 16 yuan and 3 cents, with a slight transaction, down 7 cents. Grade 22 Medium White Sugar transit goods were also transacted at 5 yuan. Swire Sugar B Mark was increasingly sluggish in yesterday's market, with transactions at 17 yuan and 10 cents, a decrease of 15 cents. The only item mentioned on the plate was Chaozhou Long White Sugar 10 packages, with the repayment being 11 yuan and 80 cents, which was also slightly easier to obtain. Chaoqing did not open because Shantou exchange rates were high and sales were difficult. This was because the firm was extremely short of funds. (The Swire Sugar inventory chart incorrectly showed an "increase" of 1,000 packages, but it should be "decrease" and should be corrected.)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Merchants Also Understand Selling Off Goods is the Right Move</h3>
<p>Over the past week, the silk market has gradually expanded and remains active to this day. Demand from American apparel manufacturers is quite pleasing, and demand from Lyon and London is not weak either. According to current observations, there is hope that the silk market will improve. However, the recent resurgence of the silk market is due to its low prices. Manufacturers are now only seeking to remain active in the market and dare not hoard goods to maintain prices, fearing a repeat of last year's mistakes. Therefore, they are successively selling off goods at cost, resulting in a lively market atmosphere, but selling prices remain sluggish.</p>

<h3>Cartoon Material</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>For the sake of "concretization," to depict in detail, and to avoid the suspicion of arbitrariness, literature always emphasizes "description." The drawback of description is that it is troublesome, because the author's opinion can only be implied through "overtones," so a large amount must be written to express the author's intention, which is not as direct and straightforward as "narration."</p>
<p>Although narration is simple and clear, it is abstract and does not give readers as deep an impression as description. It can only be used in unimportant places such as accompanying the main subject. Therefore, literature takes description as its principle, and description should be the main body of a piece.</p>
<p>Compared with painting, the advantage of literature in the use of subject matter is that it is not restricted by time and space. Events that occur in many places and experience many times can be written in one piece. Painting cannot do this. Except for the "Futurist" style, which can slightly extend the time and break the barrier of space, like photography, only the situation at one place in one moment can be expressed in one picture.</p>
<p>However, painting is always based on description. It is also two-dimensional, and the whole picture is clear at a glance, unlike literature, which must be read for a long time to understand its meaning. Moreover, description in painting is easier, especially in comics, which do not require colors and strokes. Just a few lines and outlines can express various moods and make the author's intention clear.</p>
<p>I used to hear about this kind of situation in Chengdu, that is, students take rickshaws, principals take sedan chairs, and teachers walk. Whenever I passed by the school gate around noon or evening, when school was letting out, I always had some thoughts. I thought this situation was very stark, but it could only be used as material for comics and was not suitable for writing a novel. Because if it was just narration, it would be simple, bland, and tasteless; if it was described, it would be very troublesome and not very outstanding. However, using the method of painting, this kind of subject matter is easy to move people and can achieve twice the result with half the effort, so I regarded it as material for comics and did not want to write it into a novel.</p>
<p>This time on the ship, I encountered a similar thing, that is, the writer squats in a corner of the steerage, the bookstore owner sits in a cabin, and the reader lies high in the official cabin on the top deck. I felt that this situation was even more stark than students taking rickshaws, principals taking sedan chairs, and teachers walking, but I also thought it could only be used as comic material. Of course, it is not enough to just show that the writer is squatting in the steerage, the bookstore owner is sitting in a cabin, and the reader is lying high in the official cabin. We must also carefully depict the posture and expression of these three kinds of people; it is multifaceted and complex.</p>
<p>I also think that there is no need to feel sorry for teachers and writers, because some of them also came from such students and readers. Students and readers who take rickshaws and lie high in official cabins, according to the current social situation, will inevitably have to walk on land and squat in a corner of the steerage on the sea in the future when they become teachers and writers. As long as these two kinds of subject matter are drawn appropriately, they will definitely be eye-catching and are indeed good material for comics. However, it is also possible to write them into essays!</p>
<h3>The Man-Made Madman (Middle)</h3>
<p>— He Luo</p>
<p>His clothes were torn. Tufts of hair fell down, tearing away the scalp, and blood flowed from his nose and mouth.</p>
<p>Mud, blood, and sweat mixed into a filthy sauce.</p>
<p>Such a melee continued day after day. It was as if they were all born fighters, and they could not live without fighting.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the situation of the fight changed. Two or three people joined forces against one person. But the defeated did not give in, lying on the ground for a long time, until their throats were hoarse and they had no strength, they were still fighting.</p>
<p>The mother was the most unlucky one. Whenever her sons fought, the father treated her like a "leaky pitcher," pouring all his anger on her alone, scolding her, beating her, and saying that these were the good sons she had given birth to. These dog-like sons who only knew how to fight.</p>
<p>According to the traditional Chinese spirit, the father was of course right. And the sons had long learned to beat their own wives.</p>
<p>Only the fourth son had not yet married a wife. But it was not because of this that he was more powerful than his brothers: rather, both his father and mother favored him, and from childhood they had cultivated him into a tyrant at home; from childhood he would grab his father's beard, call his father by his name, and laughingly scold his father. The only difference was that now he could run into the street and scold by name, or run on the dirt cliff in front of the yard, and his father could not catch him no matter what.</p>
<p>Although the father did not have as good a face or as good words for him as before, he still favored him in his heart. He only hoped that he would not be so rebellious. And he was always planning for him, and he would definitely give him the best land.</p>
<p>The other brothers resented him.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to get good land, and to get a little more. Everyone burned with an ugly appetite, and if there was one less person, the property allocated to their own name would be a little richer. And they all opposed the father's plan to allocate marriage expenses to the four brothers.</p>
<p>The father only wanted to punish him a little. But the brothers had higher goals, and they all wanted to drive him out.</p>
<p>The day after they pushed the father down, he came back for lunch and was caught by his brothers without any precautions, tied behind his back with a rope, and tied to the stone roller in front of the main house eaves. He stretched his legs, leaned against the stone steps, and dared not move. If he moved the stone roller, it would roll down and even crush his bones.</p>
<p>The May sun shone on his head, steaming with heat: his shoulders were covered with welts from rattan stripes.</p>
<p>The father, exhausted from beating people, lay on the large kang in the main house, sometimes sitting up, scolding a few words, cursing a few times, and then lying down again.</p>
<p>The brothers all hid in their own rooms, whispering something with their wives and children.</p>
<p>Only the mother was loving, accompanying him sitting on the stone steps, praying to God to teach him to change his mind.</p>
<p>In front of them, scattered broken pieces of bowls, millet, and cornmeal, and several flies.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he shouted, cursed, and declared his unyielding will, his voice full of hatred.</p>
<p>Not long after, the mother secretly untied the rope and let her beloved son go.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Where did he go? No one knows.</p>
<p>The father did not want people to mention him.</p>
<p>The brothers only wanted to hear bad news about him.</p>
<p>The mother prayed to God to protect him, to show him a great road in life, and to come back as a good son who could become independent and start a family.</p>
<p>The following spring, he came back. The atmosphere in the family immediately became tense again. The brothers welcomed him with a very fierce quarrel and fight.</p>
<p>He looked at everyone with a more stiff and wild look.</p>
<p>When the father's thought turned to the remote Thousand-Book family of three generations of widows, the brothers were very happy, the mother was also happy, and he was also happy: this was more beneficial, much better than the father's quarter of the property.</p>
<p>The father calculated very carefully that by adopting his son out, he would get more property for himself. The name was obviously to pass on the lineage for others, but the blood was his own, planting his own seeds in other people's fields, the seeds were his own, and the offspring were really his own branch. Moreover, the family business that he had worked hard all his life to create for his children and grandchildren would be divided into three parts, and the share would be even greater.</p>
<p>The father favored him, so the father had promised him the right of inheritance to this unique person and unique business. And according to his own wishes, he was planning and carrying out it with all his heart, teaching him many ways to get close to widows.</p>
<p>After about a year, he and his father finally achieved the goal of plundering property.</p>
<p>But plundering property was not limited to him and his father. In the widow's close relatives, there were also superfluous people who were greedy and lazy, opening their mouths and waiting for food. Now seeing that others had inherited this good property, their eyes turned red with anxiety.</p>
<h3>"That Poem"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>"That poem I sent (to you) yesterday"—He hadn't even managed to spit out the words "to you" before he realized that using those two words seemed a little too crude. His eyes fixed on her pale cheek and dark hair, and in a flash, his mind ran through a quick revision. Red-faced, he spoke in a more refined tone:</p>
<p>"That poem I sent over yesterday, what did you think?"</p>
<p>Her face flushed as well, even her ears turning a translucent shade of red. Because she remembered that the poem was still tucked inside a book, casually tossed on a table. Ashamed, she slowed her pace a little, raised her face slightly to glance at him, and after her lips twitched twice, she said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I haven't…"</p>
<p>"It's alright, it's alright, it's perfectly alright," he hastily nodded at her, as if he were the one who was deeply apologetic. When he saw her turn her face forward again and keep walking, he furrowed his dark eyebrows, scratched at the oily hair behind his ears, and sighed. "Rats. She still hasn't read it—is she playing dumb? Is she... alas, women!"</p>
<p>He kept close to her heels. Finally, he decided to reach out and take her hand. If she didn't pull away, then it wouldn't matter if she read the poem or not. They would be the same. With that thought, he bent his right hand toward her left, and at the same time, he muttered something vague:</p>
<p>"That poem…"</p>
<p>"Someone's coming!" Her face flushed, and she quickly dodged to the side.</p>
<p>Startled, he looked up and saw two yellow-faced men wearing bird-hunting caps walking toward them. The taller one squeezed his small eyes at him, and the shorter one stuck out his red tongue. Furious, he pursed his lips. But maintaining his composure, he turned his gaze aside and kept walking. However, just as he and she walked abreast of the two men, he immediately heard strange noises coming at them head-on:</p>
<p>"Ahem! Uh, ahem, ahem!"</p>
<p>"Shhh! Shhh! Shhh!"</p>
<p>He saw that she beside him was flushed, and he felt his own cheeks heating up. Avoiding the faces of the two guys, he vaguely measured their build and the back of his own gray flannel suit, and still felt: "Not worth it!" And so, he calmly walked past. Looking at her next to him, she was still looking down, walking even faster, as if she was about to leave him behind. He immediately fixed his eyes longingly on the heels of her high-heeled shoes and took two quick steps to catch up with her. But he still felt apologetic for not protecting her. He almost reached out to touch her shoulder, but he immediately became aware and kept his right hand in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Ahem! Uh, ahem!" seemed to be right behind him.</p>
<p>"Shhh! Shhh!" The tip of his ear seemed to feel the hot breath blowing on it.</p>
<p>He became so angry that his face turned green, and his eyes bulged. But he still kept his composure. He looked up and suddenly saw a white-skinned, high-nosed, black-clothed constable appear at the corner of the street opposite. His left hand was on the black leather gun holster at his waist, and his right hand was swinging as he walked. He could no longer keep calm. He raised his head and turned around, facing the two yellow faces with bird-hunting caps. At that moment, she, who was walking beside him, suddenly covered her suddenly opened lips with a slender finger, and quickly stepped back.</p>
<p>"What are you doing!?" he yelled, green-faced, at the two yellow-faced men with bird-hunting caps. "Hmph, you! This, this, this…"</p>
<p>The shorter one opened his mouth wide, preparing to roar. But the taller one had already seen the high-nosed constable walking up quickly, and quietly tugged at his sleeve. Only then did the shorter one immediately change his lips into an "O" shape and said, "Shhh!" And stuck out his red tongue. The two of them quickly turned around and left.</p>
<p>"What do you think you're doing? Hmph! Absolutely outrageous!" He put his hands on his hips, shrugged his shoulders, as if he was about to step forward.</p>
<p>"Forget it, let them go," she said with a frown from where she stood nearby. But he finally took two steps, paused, snorted through his nostrils, "Hmph, hooligans!" Only then did he turn around, seeming to feel victorious. He raised his head, his face glowing, and walked toward her, making his leather shoes sound especially crisp and loud. He walked up to her.</p>
<p>"Hmph, these things," he said. "If you ignore them, they'll think you're afraid of them! If you don't give them a little taste of what's what, they won't know." As he said this, he stared deeply into her clear, watery eyes, wondering if she admired his bravery. Moreover, he felt as though he had suddenly grown in her eyes.</p>
<p>As they walked side by side, he thought of his plan to take her hand earlier. "After this victory, isn't this a great opportunity?" he thought. And so, in some vague way, he mumbled, "That poem—" and at the same time, his right hand also…</p>
<h3>Dreamscape</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Turning over,</p>
<p>I think, this must be a dream!</p>
<p>A light gauze veil,</p>
<p>Nets a hardworking heart.</p>
<p>In the distance,</p>
<p>There are mountains, smoking!</p>
<p>Clouds, smoke, mist, obscuring the sun,</p>
<p>Heavy, thick, and long like lead!</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the sea,</p>
<p>A vast expanse, so green, so deep,</p>
<p>Gulls, flying, still calling,</p>
<p>Waves, rolling, pushing and shoving as they run;</p>
<p>No human habitation,</p>
<p>At the end, where the sky and water meet in a line.</p>
<p>A floating boat, a leaf,</p>
<p>A sail, raising tears of bitterness!</p>
<p>Shall we walk towards that line?</p>
<p>Tall figures, holding ropes,</p>
<p>Several shadows, moving around.</p>
<p>A gust of wind rolls up,</p>
<p>The water, smiling foolishly!</p>
<p>Pull faster! Turn the rudder! Use your strength!</p>
<p>Crashing toward…</p>
<p>Waves rolling and running, mouths agape,</p>
<p>The sky and water meeting in a line, that end,</p>
<p>The water smiling foolishly.</p>
<h3>University Days (5)</h3>
<p>— By German Author Storm, Translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>After a while, the pairs of dancers all coordinated. I was the second in the boys' team, and Nali became my dance partner. She smiled when she put her hand in mine. "We have to dance past everyone!" I said—and we did. At first, while learning the "Mazurka," after the first hour, because we didn't dance the whirls well, our old instructor had already knocked on the cymbals with his bow and said: "Miss Bolika! Mr. Fili! You two dance for everyone to see!" As he strummed and sang the song, we danced. Dancing with her did not require any skill, and I believed that no one could go wrong. But the old teacher kept calling "Good!" and the mayor's wife also looked joyful, smiling and leaning on the sofa—she had been sitting there watching very carefully since the beginning of the lesson.</p>
<p>Miss Charlotte was assigned to my friend Fritz as a dance partner. I was glad to see that her lively nature soon made Fritz forget his initial admiration for the tailor's daughter. Now that I had regarded this tailor's daughter as my private property, the beauty and gentleness of my dance partner were what I boasted of. One glance from her neatly dressed rival caught my attention, and following that gaze, I finally realized that the mayor's wife had overlooked one thing: her gloves were too big, not matching her small hands, and were clearly washed ones.</p>
<p>The next morning, when I came back from class, I couldn't be still for a moment. I rushed to the clothes tree, took out my tin piggy bank, and did my best to grope and shake it until I got a silver coin out through the red cloth covering the seam. Then I ran to a store. —"I want to buy white gloves!" I said, with a bit of apprehension.</p>
<p>The clerk looked at my hand with his expert eyes. "Number five!" he said, placing the glove box on the table at the same time. "Let me have number five!" I said softly.</p>
<p>—"Number five? That won't go on," he was already about to measure the glove against my hand.</p>
<p>I blushed. "These gloves are not for me!" I said, feeling more regretful than ever that I didn't have a sister, otherwise I could have put this on her. But now the small gloves with white ribbons were spread out in front of me, and I was very happy to see them. I bought two pairs. Not long after leaving the store, I found a child on the street. "Take this to Nali Bolika!" I said. "Say the gloves for dancing are from the mayor's wife! Come back and tell me what happens; I'll wait for you at the corner."</p>

<h3>Eradicating Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry Who Prey on the People</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>This time, in order to eliminate bandits and protect the interests of the people, the General Headquarters has issued a "Revised Ordinance for Punishing Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry in Bandit Suppression Areas." For the class of local tyrants and evil gentry, anyone who (1) acts arbitrarily in the countryside, oppresses the people, (2) relies on wealth and power to deceive government offices or distort right and wrong, coercing officials, (3) flaunts strength and numbers to obstruct government orders or local public interests, (4) borrows the name of the public to levy donations and fees, embezzling wealth for personal gain or occupying public institutions, encroaching on public funds, (5) forges material evidence, directs hooligans to frame good people, (6) protects private opium dens and gambling houses, (7) extorts money from officials under the pretext of drafting corvée labor and public expenses, thereby depriving others of their physical freedom, shall be investigated and dealt with according to law, either with the death penalty or imprisonment. This is truly the good fortune of the villagers in the bandit areas!</p>
<p>Speaking of local tyrants and evil gentry, who doesn't know that they are a kind of unscrupulous elements who prey on the people, relying on their strength and influence? Their behavior can be described as committing all kinds of evil. They occupy a village, like a local emperor, acting lawlessly and demanding whatever they want. Their crimes, as listed in the above ordinance, are still only the major ones. To list their crimes in detail is really not something that a few ordinances can cover. In short, they are simply a heinous demon! The suffering of the general good villagers under their oppression is truly indescribable. However, the villagers, under their tyrannical power, all fear them like tigers and wolves, and can do nothing about them!</p>
<p>In recent years, the anger of the villagers in various places has had no outlet, and thus they have gone astray. Some people believe that this is because the villagers are ignorant and have been incited by others. In fact, there are indeed people who have been incited by others. But those who take risks out of desperation are in the majority. Therefore, to save today's bandit areas, punishing local tyrants and evil gentry is essential.</p>
<p>However, the trampling of villagers by local tyrants and evil gentry in our country is not limited to bandit areas. In all villages, such dregs exist everywhere. Therefore, if we hope that local tyrants and evil gentry will disappear, we should extend this law of punishing local tyrants and evil gentry to the whole country, and carry out a thorough and universal eradication. Unless this is done, it is not enough to talk about protecting the interests of the villagers!</p>
<h3>Butcher</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhong</p>
<p>Village Scene: From the "Grain in Ear" drought to "White Dew," people's eyebrows and eyelashes were scorched, unable to straighten up.</p>
<p>People: After methods of worshiping Bodhisattvas and carrying the "Dog Lord" to pray for rain proved ineffective, the "Plague God" visited them uninvited.</p>
<p>"Good fortune never comes in pairs, but misfortune never comes alone!"</p>
<p>Everyone with a sick person in their family lamented this way.</p>
<p>The plague had eyes; first, it seized the children, making the adults anxious for a while, then it was the adults' turn, one family after another, until it affected the entire village. There was no water to drink, and naturally no medicine to take; the doctors idled, watching this business opportunity slip through their fingers. The discredited Bodhisattvas were even more unlucky—no one went to pray to them anymore.</p>
<p>"It's truly a calamity, Heaven is punishing people!"</p>
<p>Whenever faced with a difficult problem, especially the elderly liked to say it was a "calamity," "the will of Heaven," because no true Son of Heaven had appeared, and people's hearts had become corrupted. Those old scholars who knew a little history would even bring up the story of the "Five Barbarians Uprising" as their argument. Moreover, they sometimes cited examples of emperors when the weather was favorable, the country was prosperous, rice was a few small coins per *sheng*, salt was a few small coins per *jin*, and when someone fell ill, buying medicine and hiring a doctor would only cost a few hundred coins. Now that it was the "end times," everything gave them a chance to reminisce about the bygone "golden age."</p>
<p>Regardless of day or night, the rocket-like wind still bravely swept across, the forest echoed with the desolate melody of late autumn, and the people's hearts and rice paddies alike cracked into pieces, about to fly away.</p>
<p>Although there was no food to eat, no one wanted someone to die in their home. But the disease developed with extraordinary speed, a sign: vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. In less than a couple of hours, the patient would die.</p>
<p>After Li Ba's son behind the mountain died, it wasn't even a day before Li Ba also passed away: but Li Ba was a good person, everyone said so.</p>
<p>At this time, the entire Xu Family Village transitioned from starvation to the terror of death. Whether a patient could be dragged back from the brink of death depended on the merits accumulated by their ancestors and the *feng shui* of their ancestral graves.</p>
<p>Jiang the butcher, around fifty years old, also had a sick son. The butcher's wife, with her rotten peach eyes, constantly complained that in previous years he had used a white knife to go in and a red knife to come out, accumulating countless sins, which were now being visited upon their son. With only one child in two generations, this single root could not be saved; her fate was bad, she hadn't cultivated virtue in her past life, and now it was too late to repent, but she was confident that she hadn't done anything evil in this life. If her son died, it must be because her husband had implicated her.</p>
<p>"How is he? The child is so heavy!"</p>
<p>The butcher's wife squatted in front of a bed covered with a patched quilt, testing the temperature of her son's forehead, then fingering her prayer beads, murmuring "Amitabha." At the end of this sound, she was met with the sound of her son defecating: *splatter*—the three-year-old son had defecated on the bed. The butcher's wife didn't have time to grab a dung bucket and screamed.</p>
<p>"Calling on Heaven won't help me! 'A broken oar stump in Dongting Lake,' ghosts won't save you!"</p>
<p>Jiang the butcher stood dumbfounded, truly like a broken oar stump with no way to help, watching the boat drift with the current.</p>
<p>But he kept the news of the death of Li Ba and his son extremely secret from the butcher's wife—this news would only increase her terror. (To be continued)</p>
<p>This house was located in a corner of the mountain in Xu Family Village, the mottled mud walls having more patches than Jiang the butcher's blue cloth jacket and pants. They had lived alone in this tiny corner of the world for three generations. If you looked at Jiang the butcher's solemn personality and shabby appearance, you wouldn't believe that he had once been a pig slaughterer, considered cruel by people, nor would you trust that he had had a smooth and easy life in his youth. But even five years ago, Jiang the butcher was still doing well.</p>
<p>Naturally, he helped people as a farmhand, just like his grandfather and father, but he had a side business—slaughtering pigs. The motivation was: when a man reaches twenty-five, no one will mend his clothes, especially since the responsibility of "single line of descent" had fallen on his shoulders. But thirty-six strings of cash a year wasn't enough to marry a wife and raise children, so he chose this path. On the fifth and eighth days of the month, and the three festivals of the lunar year, or for weddings and funerals, he would ask for leave to do this business. For each pig, in addition to eating and drinking his fill, he could still earn three or four thousand cash and a few *jin* of pig bristles. He had money and was diligent and thrifty in his work, but because the pig slaughterer was believed to be possessed by ghosts, no one was willing to marry their daughter to him.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he was thirty-six that he married the butcher's wife, but he still hadn't had a son by the time he was forty-six. He was anxious, but the butcher's wife blamed it on him:</p>
<p>"It's always the slaughtering, the killing that harms life!"</p>
<p>After all, a son was more important than money, so he decided to stop doing this business and invited several monks to chant repentance at home and buried the knife in the ground.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the following year, the butcher's wife gave birth to a fat son.</p>
<p>"People must do good deeds! As soon as Jiang the butcher put down the knife, he had a son!"</p>
<p>The neighbors all said this.</p>
<p>From pregnancy to childbirth, Jiang the butcher and his wife were as joyous and cherished as if they had picked up a gold nugget from the sand.</p>
<p>The money they had accumulated was spent as their son grew older. Now it was a "dry season," he had lost his job, and his son had fallen ill. Even people with fields and land in Xu Family Village were helpless, and he, who relied on labor to rent land, was naturally even more desperate. He glanced at the child lying on the bed in the dim light under the mud window, and at his wife, who was leaning against the edge of the bed, crying, and then went out to look at the sky.</p>
<p>The sky was still carefree, holding up its fiery umbrella, and even the seedlings in the wind had been cut off. He hoped that the hour would quickly approach dusk, feeling that darkness was slightly better than this cruel light. He paced back and forth in this short, three-room house, as anxious as a lion pacing in a cage. The butcher's wife screamed again from the room:</p>
<p>"Old man! Shenbao has defecated again! His eyes have sunken in, and he's nothing but skin and bones. Even if we can't afford a doctor, we have to get him some rice porridge!"</p>
<p>"Where would we get rice porridge? The whole village can't find any rice, even the tree bark has been eaten. Don't you know that?" Jiang the butcher responded in the main room, hurriedly bringing in the half-eaten bark rake left over from lunch.</p>
<p>"Heavens! It's as hard as iron, how can he eat it!" The old woman stopped his hand: "A father must always be worthy of his son!"</p>
<p>"Are you trying to force me to die?—In this day and age, who can afford to be a father! Who wants to be a father? I'd rather be his son!"</p>
<p>Zheng Tai's wife from behind the mountain brought the news of the death of Li Ba and his son, and also about Chang Mazi's two children, and the wife of the village head's uncle. Each sentence was like a needle pricking at the butcher's wife's heart. She coldly examined her own son, and a strange pain enveloped her entire body.</p>
<p>Dusk finally arrived. Shenbao sank into the depths of his dying moments, only turbid water flowing from his anus, his eyeballs mechanically turning like a foreign doll. The butcher's wife felt for her son's breath, and again recited "Amitabha, Bodhisattva bless Shenbao." Jiang the butcher staggered back and forth in this dark room, as if searching for something. Suddenly,</p>
<p>"There's no air coming from his nose! It's all because you've done too much evil, and it's being visited on him, you've implicated me!" The butcher's wife cried and stamped her feet.</p>
<p>"Who told him to be born into a poor family? Why blame me?—Did I slaughter pigs? Li Ba and his son never slaughtered pigs! ... There are many people who kill, does that mean slaughtering pigs is a sin!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he went to dig up the knife buried in the ground, for what purpose no one knew. (The End)</p>
<h3>Granddaughters and Grandsons</h3>
<h3>The Sun and Others</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>When my own endless years flow by constantly in darkness, and it seems as if they will flow into exhaustion in darkness forever, how much I envy and love those golden, large, and healthy sunflowers! They are eternally brave and happy; they live solely by relying on the sun—truly, how eagerly they await this warm and bright sun: they always look at him with their eyes, they always follow him and turn their direction; and when the sun goes down, they also lose their joy, lose the courage to live—in the shade, I have seen their drooping heads sighing and contemplating, how aptly expressing the dying of a life—I understood: it is the tragedy of life!</p>
<p>Thus, for my own small soul being imprisoned for a long time on the dark road of life, I often think of the sun, think of the large, golden sunflowers that love to look at the sun. Perhaps they are relatively happier—when the sun goes down, when it is night, when it is cloudy, although the sun has left them, there is no golden light, nor the warmth of spring; yet they can still imagine, can still anticipate, can still hope! On a muddy road of life that is unsuitable for walking, can you also bear to say: is hope merely an empty dream, a dream that cannot represent the happiness of the future?</p>
<p>Moreover, in the world, who can deny the sun, the mother of light and heat. The sun is healthy, it disinfects, every doctor says so, every living being thinks so; it is the nutrient of life! Think about it: in the arena of life, who dares to be a traitor to the sun? Whoever rebels against the sun rebels against life full of strength and health.</p>
<p>The light and smiles that shine in dreams day and night, how beautiful they should be, yet, how mismatched they are with real life. Yes, dreams and reality are separated by an immeasurable distance; in dreams, I seem to live on warm, dry land, with red flowers, green grass, and the golden light of the sun, where the road is smooth, the wind is light, the surroundings are bright and need no groping, and life is always nurtured under the sun.</p>
<p>However, when this sunlit dream is shattered, and I see my own life again, the world has changed beyond belief! It is still a young soul! However, along with it, I bear the cumbersome shackles of life, stepping forward step by step on a muddy, boundless, dark road, where it is difficult to distinguish the pile of stumbling blocks lying in front of the road, and difficult to breathe in a mouthful of uncontaminated air.</p>
<p>Dragging the burden of life day after day, groping in the dark, with no light, no heat. Where the end will be is hard to predict! Perhaps this boundless darkness will engulf an entire lifetime, and the outline of the sun can only be imitated in dreams forever?—The road of life is the Arctic Circle of the human world, with only mountains and barren land of ice and snow year after year, where the sun is treated as a rare miracle that is not easily seen!</p>
<p>But, can it really be said that the flowers of life can grow in areas lacking the sun? Who can believe this? In any flower, except for poisonous mushrooms, none can survive without sunlight, so how can the flowers of life be an exception?</p>
<p>Carrying life day by day on the road of time, in my heart I deeply remember the sun, the mother of light and heat; but, how far is she separated from me?</p>
<p>Then let the sun disappear forever, let the flowers of life wither!</p>

<h3>A King's Meddling in Politics</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>Jincheng Also Has to Install Air Conditioning</p>
<p>The first-run cinemas in Shanghai mostly screen foreign films. Currently, Jincheng and Xinguang are the two cinemas that screen domestic films. However, Xinguang sometimes still screens foreign films, so to be stricter, only Jincheng is truly a cinema that specializes in domestic films. Therefore, Jincheng Cinema has become the only place for domestic film fans to relax.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the momentum of domestic films is not as great as that of foreign films. Based on the current situation, it is not that domestic films are not popular, but because their production is too small. For example, Jincheng Grand Theater initially only screened films from Lianhua Company, and it is said that they often felt a shortage of films. However, because they adhered to the purpose of "promoting domestic films," now, in addition to Lianhua, the productions of Yihua, Diantong, Tianyi, New Era, and Jixing companies have been screened in the theater, and the "Dizzy Madness" produced by Yueming Company will also be screened after "The Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>The summer season has arrived, and most cinemas with air conditioning have already opened it. Jincheng Grand Theater already had air conditioning installed last summer, but it was not very satisfactory. It is said that this year the theater has sacrificed a huge sum of money and invited York Company, the most reputable air conditioning expert in Shanghai, to retrofit a new type of air conditioning equipment, which will be completed soon. The air conditioning equipment of the largest cinemas in Shanghai, such as Nanjing Guotai, are all installed by York, and the results are well-known. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that the air conditioning at Jincheng this year will satisfy the audience, and movie fans throughout Shanghai do not have to worry about not having good domestic films to enjoy this summer.</p>
<h3>Microphone Broadcast</h3>
<p>In Shen Xiling's directed "Nostalgia," a group of children sing an orphan song. It is extremely tragic. It is said that this film will be released next week.</p>
<p>Gong Jianong, Wang Huijuan, and Li Qing each rode a bicycle yesterday on Fuli Road in the French Concession. It is said that they plan to invite more than a dozen people to take a long trip next Sunday.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu's recent work, "Jadeite Horse," is a rough-line work. The "Jadeite Horse" title and subject matter are taken from the trademark of a drug in the play, not a martial arts style such as stealing a jade horse.</p>
<p>The New Era's sequel to "Mr. Wang Spends the New Year" was originally set as "Mr. Wang Makes Trouble in a Coffee Shop," but now it is said that the direction has been changed, and the "Coffee Shop" will be closed, and "Mr. Wang Goes to the People" to live his rural life.</p>
<p>The first sound production of Kuaihuo Forest Company, "Little Aunt," is said to have excellent content, plot, and picture and sound.</p>
<h3>Lianhua Communications</h3>
<p>Shang Guanwu's progress in performance is truly amazing. The scene of dying of illness in "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp" is performed with full emotion, making it very touching. Therefore, many colleagues say that Lao Shang died well.</p>
<p>Ma Xu Weibang acts in "Wild Geese Landing on Cold River," never leaving the car, because the character in the play has paralyzed legs.</p>
<p>The Liang family's little sister, Sai Hu, is good at singing and dancing, and is able to display her talents in "Four Sisters."</p>
<p>There is a great lack of Chinese children's educational films. The gentry should not neglect "Little Angel" for this type of film.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng is very busy preparing for his new work. Ge Zuotai was invited to listen to the plot.</p>

<h3>The Design of Warehouse Construction</h3>
<p>— Little Ang</p>
<p>In recent years, with the promotion of responsible transportation by railways across the country, the rural economy has indeed become much more vibrant. Recently, major shipping companies, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanbei Shipping, have also implemented through transport. As a result, the transportation of goods throughout the country has indeed become much more convenient. However, there are often times when wagons are lacking and goods cannot be transported. Therefore, goods must have a place to be stored, so the construction of warehouses is most needed. In the past, my country's railway freight was not very developed, so the construction of storage facilities was very careless. Even the warehouses of steamships in various ports along the Yangtze River were very simple. These should be specially improved to meet the needs. I will now talk about the main points of setting up warehouses.</p>
<p>(1) Location Selection: Warehouses are divided into two types, one is railway warehouses and the other is shipping warehouses. The key to choosing a location is convenient transportation and easy loading and unloading. Therefore, the location of the warehouse must be built near railways, rivers, or roads. The cargo depot on Maigen Road in Shanghai is in a good location, facing Suzhou Creek in front, backing onto the railway, and connected to the road. Therefore, freight transportation on both routes is particularly developed. Warehouses are generally about ten to fifteen meters away from waterways, and should be within twenty meters of freight stations and roads, because the closer, the more labor-saving and economical. The construction of warehouses should not be too small or too large. If it is too small, it is not enough to store goods, and if it is too large, the construction cost will definitely be very high. Generally, it starts with the current needs, and when choosing a location, one must consider future needs, so the land may as well be larger.</p>
<p>(2) Construction Key Points: Since the size of the warehouse is determined by the amount of freight, its length should be at least fifty meters and at most one hundred meters. Its width is generally fifteen meters. If one warehouse is not enough, several more can be built, some are parallel, some are side-by-side, and some are side-by-side and parallel, entirely depending on the size and shape of the land. However, the distance between each row should be at least fifteen meters, because fire prevention is something to pay attention to. Among the warehouse styles, single-story buildings are the most common, and two- or three-story buildings are the least common.</p>
<p>(3) Material Selection: The key to a warehouse is that it is strong, free from fire hazards, and resistant to rain erosion, so the selection of materials is the most important. It is very good to use copper and iron to build, but it is too expensive. Steel-reinforced concrete is better than any material, and many warehouses have been built with it. Wood is very expensive in China, and at the same time it is not strong and is afraid of water and fire, so remember not to use it.</p>
<p>(4) Warehouse Equipment: Since warehouses are used for storing goods, the internal equipment should be particularly complete. Ordinary warehouses have refrigeration equipment, so fruits, milk, meat, and the like will not spoil. The second important piece of equipment is fire prevention. The fire prevention equipment in Chinese warehouses is extremely careless, so fires are often heard of, and the losses cannot be counted. The third piece of equipment is to prevent moisture erosion. If cotton and agricultural products are exposed to moisture, they will rot immediately, and those responsible for transportation will suffer greatly. These are all extremely important issues, and also extremely small issues. Designers have to pay attention to them. China's transportation industry is still in its infancy. The construction of warehouses will definitely increase day by day, so let the architects study it.</p>
<h3>Lighting Design in New-Style Architecture</h3>
<p>— Xihao</p>
<p>The importance of "light" to the human body is already well known. It can control people's health, and at the same time, it can affect work efficiency. A building with insufficient light loses the value of the entire building.</p>
<p>There are only two sources of "light," namely sunlight and artificial light. The design of sunlight in architecture is very simple. Just carefully select the orientation of the building and open appropriate window areas on the building to achieve good results. However, the design of artificial light is not so simple. It has a very close relationship with the reflection, color, and intensity of the light inside the building. At the same time, it has a direct impact on the stimulation of the human spirit and the comfort of health. Therefore, special consideration should be given to it when designing.</p>
<p>The most necessary conditions for "lighting" design can be roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Appropriateness of Light Properties - A certain type of light has a special reflection effect on the specified color, which increases the efficiency of light emission, so we should choose a suitable light to meet our purpose.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid Glare - Glaring light is enough to over-stimulate people's nerves, causing dizziness and damaging health.</p>
<p>(3) Average Light Distribution - Average light distribution makes the light intensity in the entire room equal, and the reflection is average, so things in the room can be easily found.</p>
<p>(4) Shadows Should Be Avoided - Shadows can hinder vision and dim the light, so they should be avoided.</p>
<p>(5) Appropriate Light Level - In each building, because the purpose of use is different, the required light intensity also changes. For example, the reception room needs a stronger light level, the lounge needs a gentler light level, and the bedroom can have a relatively weaker light level. Such differences should be given special attention when designing.</p>
<p>(6) Utilize Indirect Light Transmission - Directing light directly into the eyes will not only prevent you from seeing things in the room, but also cause the pupils to contract, damaging the eyeballs. We should use indirect diffused light. To achieve this goal, the distance of the lights can be placed appropriately, and frosted light bulbs or appropriate reflectors can be used.</p>
<p>The requirements for perfect lighting design have been described above. As for the factors that affect the light reflectance, they can be roughly divided into the following:</p>
<p>(A) Ceiling Color</p>
<p>(B) Wall Color</p>
<p>(C) Room Size and Shape</p>
<p>The colors of the ceiling and walls directly affect the intensity of light reflection. Light colors have a stronger reflectivity, and dark colors have a weaker reflectivity. According to test results, the percentage of reflected light of various colors can be roughly divided into the following: (1) White - 95, (2) Light Red - 80, (3) Light Yellow - 65, (4) Canary Yellow - 56, (5) Grass Green - 50, (6) Black - 10.</p>
<p>Among them, white has the strongest reflectivity and is suitable for use in writing rooms, pattern-making rooms, reception rooms, etc. Light red and canary yellow are most suitable for bedrooms and can achieve extremely gentle beauty.</p>
<p>The size of the room is also related to the amount of light required. According to test results, the most suitable "foot candle" for various buildings can be described as follows:</p>
<p>Type Foot Candle</p>
<p>Reading Room 8-12</p>
<p>Pattern-Making Room 15-20</p>
<p>Writing Room 8-12</p>
<p>Bedroom 5-6</p>
<p>Lounge 8-10</p>
<p>Shop Window 30-100</p>
<p>Before designing the lighting, we should first analyze the size of the room, the interior colors, and the purpose of use, and then configure the appropriate lighting. The effect obtained in this way will definitely be very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Recent Portrait of Architect Fan Wenzhao Attending the International Architectural Conference</h3>
<p>Architect Fan Wenzhao, under the order of the Ministry of Interior, will attend the International Architectural Conference held in London on July 15th of this year. He set sail on the Empress of Canada the day before yesterday. Mr. Fan departed from the Xinguang Wharf at 4 pm on the 16th to board the ship. Dozens of his relatives and friends went to see him off. It is said that in addition to attending the above-mentioned conference and going to Rome to attend the International Architectural Conference organized by architects from various countries, he will also take the opportunity to inspect the aviation construction industry in various European countries.</p>
<p>(Note) Mr. Fan is one of the leading figures in China's architectural circle. He graduated from the Architecture Department of the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. He is the initiator of the Chinese Institute of Architects in this area, and served as the first president of the association, as well as a member of the Capital Design Committee, a specialist member and standing committee member of the Capital Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Planning Committee, and a technical specialist of the Ministry of Railways of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (16)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>Transgressing the Boundary - The work done in the construction site, no matter how small and detailed or how large and "strange," must follow the drawings made by the "ghost drawer" (detailed earlier) step by step as the standard, and must not be arbitrarily made up. However, in some places, the dimensions on the original drawings sometimes do not match the location of the foundation. For example, the width of an alley on the original drawing is twelve feet. But after the lime plastering (detailed earlier), because the dimensions of the land on both sides of the houses are accurately calculated, the dimension of the alley is only ten feet or eleven feet. In that case, the dimensions of the drawing and the original foundation clearly do not match. The responsibility, of course, lies with the ghost drawer. Such a situation is called "transgressing the boundary". The two words "transgressing the boundary," like "Kouya Kou Chong Xie" (detailed earlier), have become specialized terms in the construction site. (In fact, it is a verb)</p>
<p>Road Crown - It is the center of the road, because the road slopes on both sides, only the center of the road (i.e., the road crown), and the curb of the sidewalk are at the same height. However, it is best to use the curb as the standard height for the foundation of the house, as it is more reliable.</p>
<p>Nail Driving - When laying floorboards, in addition to using iron horses (detailed earlier) to tighten the floorboards, use wire nails to nail the floorboards in place. However, the wire nails must not be exposed on the surface. (Because after the floorboards are laid, they must be planed smooth.) Fearing that the nails will come into contact with the planer, the nails are driven down with a nail set. It is pointed at one end and about the same size as the nail head. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Comparison of Steel and Wood Construction and Future Trends (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xihao</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the development of the steel industry and the strength of steel itself, almost all larger buildings have mostly adopted steel as a building material, such as reinforced concrete and composite steel frames, etc., which are now almost universal. Living in this steel world, the wood construction knowledge inherited from thousands of years ago is obviously showing signs of wavering. According to the speculation of ordinary people, in the near future, this kind of wood construction is expected to be rejected by steel construction. But this speculation is absolutely wrong. The use of wood in construction will never diminish. Now let us briefly analyze their properties, and everything will become clear.</p>
<p>The main reasons why wood has been regarded as an important building material by past and present generations can be roughly divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) Low Price - Several times cheaper than steel or iron.</p>
<p>(2) Very Light Weight - Lighter than any building material.</p>
<p>(3) Convenient Transportation or Handling - Due to its light weight.</p>
<p>(4) Easy to Work With - Can be sawn or cut into any shape.</p>
<p>From the above advantages, we can imagine the low price, lightness, and design convenience of wood construction. Therefore, wood is really the most suitable for general light and temporary construction. Moreover, wood construction has one of the greatest advantages, which is the absorption of vibration. This point is really very important for people's comfort.</p>
<p>As for the shortcomings of wood construction, they are certainly unavoidable. The following are probably the most important.</p>
<p>(1) Easy to Catch Fire - This is a problem with the wood itself.</p>
<p>(2) Defects in Wood - Almost every piece of wood has unavoidable defects, such as cracks, impure fibers, etc. - These defects are enough to hinder the wood itself and the strength of the entire building.</p>
