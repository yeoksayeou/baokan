<h3>工廠安全與公衆安全</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>工塲多利器。且其原動之力。非水火。卽電力。機輪飛轉。引擊轆轆。稍一不愼卽易肇禍。工人之斷臂折脰。橫死非命者時有所聞。至若禍變擴大。損害且有及於職工以外之人。廠舍以外之屋。如往年某麥精廠失事。傷及行路之人。今年賽璐珞廠失愼。延及鄰居多家。死傷纍纍。凡此橫禍。至堪憫惻吾人於此不禁念及工廠安全設備之無限重要。此固非僅「禁止吸烟」與幾具「太平桶」所可盡其能事者也。</p>
<p>工塲爲營業主財產之所在。亦卽工人托命之所。勞資雙方自均不欲工塲之肇禍。然禍害仍有發生者。蓋不外數因。（一）一時之疏忽釀成大禍。（二）貪圖小利忘却大害。（三）設備過於簡陋。故爲工場計。與其設備不周。財產在在有損失之虞。則何如防患於未然。無惜目前小費。而謀安全設備之爲愈。至爲工人計。工作不愼。易生危險。大則捐軀。小則殘廢。甚至禍及旁人。累及工廠。何如隨時隨地。謹愼從事。免蹈不測之禍。工廠方面誠應時相警戒。見有技藝未臻純熟之工人。不使之任重要工作。而工人疲勞之程度。尤應加以調節。免致因精神不繼而疏忽肇禍。凡此數者皆。爲工塲與工人雙方之安全計也。</p>
<p>至公衆受工塲不愼之損害。所以時有所聞者。則以今日之工塲。因事實上之關係。難期一時改善耳。吾人爲懲前毖後計。對於工塲之檢査。自應隨時加以正確之指導。飭令改蕃。凡含有爆發性或易於炸裂之物料。及其工作塲所。亦應有預防危險之設備。貯料之所。非牆垣屋蓋堅牢者不可。或卽建築地庫。以便貯藏。凡已成立之工塲。一時不易令其改善者。得限制其材料之存儲。規定其至少限度之消防設備。以防萬一。再則工塲設立之處。機聲軋軋。至足妨害公衆之安寧。而塵灰飛揚。濁氣四播。亦足爲公衆衛生之害。故各大工業都市。均應劃置工業區域。凡工廠應就工業區覓地設立。其在非工業區域者。將來如新建廠房。亦當就工業區建築之。如是則當局對於工廠之監督檢査。及其應有之設施。卽可威不少便利。至繁盛鬧市如有易於發生危險之工塲。尤應預示限制。免致成立之後。飭令變更。而損失益大矣。以上所述。係斟酌於工廠利害及大衆安全。略抒愚見。深望工業家對於工廠安全問題。爲適宜之處置。以防止工廠慘案之重現也。</p>

<h3>滬南公共汽車　營業發達擴展路綫　四路九月初可直達打浦橋穿城綫因路狹暫時難實行</h3>
<p>滬南公共汽車、自經市公用局收回市辦後、因管理及設備完善、營業發達、第四路綫於九月初可直達浦橋、穿城路暹綫、以馬路狹隘實行困難、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>營業擴展</p>
<p>市公用局自將滬南公公共汽車收歸市辦後、即由管理處主任張登義竭力革新、所有車輛、均向美國大蒙天所訂購、式樣輕便美觀、各路車輛、因管理設備等完善、時間迅速、故自開辦迄今、營業異常發達、乘客最多、收入最大者為第三路環城圓路、其次為龍華浦東每日略有盈餘、市府為維持界交通、故票價較之法商華商之電車等低廉、</p>
<p>四路延長</p>
<p>公共汽車第四路綫其起點及終點站定爲打浦橋、因盧家灣循斜徐路至打浦橋一段馬路、工務局尙未舖築完竣、臨時暫定盧家灣爲起終點、同時上行綫亦暫時劃定魯班路　園路·斜橋·大林路·車站路·國貨路·滬軍營·折入裏馬路境、業已改為由斜橋經陸家浜、直達裏馬路、下行綫亦改爲由老西門斜橋、經斜徐路直達盧家灣、（與法商六路電車幷行）原劃定之打浦橋路綫、工務局方面、已積極進行舖築、至九月初、當可移遷該處、</p>
<p>穿城困難</p>
<p>滬南公共汽車管理處第五路路綫、由盧家灣經老西門循肇嘉路大東門至十六舖小東門、再折入方浜路市廛繁榮、惟馬路兩旁狹隘、交車困難、故該處路綫、一時尙難實行、</p>
<h3>英商公共汽車公司　開駛一九路公共汽車</h3>
<p>英商公共汽車公司爲便利交通、特開駛一九路公共汽車、共路程為一路與九路原有之路綫合併行駛、即從愚園路經過靜安寺路·志外白渡橋、折入百老匯路而赴楊樹浦電燈廠、</p>
<h3>許曉初等辦國貨世界</h3>
<p>許曉初·劉仲英·張益齋·曹志功·葛福田·許楷賢·等、鑒於提倡國貨杜塞漏巵、爲今日當務之急、爰特發起舉辦國貨世界、業已勘定本埠公共租界南京路新世界原址爲塲所、定於八月一日開幕、連日正積極佈置、着意裝璜、預定一二兩樓劃分塲位百餘方、招致本外埠各大國貨工廠參加陳列發售、三樓則增闢游藝部、表演髙尙游藝、以助來賓餘興、該世界內小公園一所、爲夏夜納凉勝境、與商塲同時開放、聞昨已通吿本外埠國貨工廠、一致參加、登記處即設在該世界二樓辦事處、</p>

<h3>明日晨前　黃浦江發高潮　如無國風及低氣壓潮水不致泛溢江岸</h3>
<p>本月十九日晨前之浦江髙潮、尙爲本年七個月以來最髙之一日、其所發數量、據濬浦局預測、達十一呎七吋、距離外灘十三呎之江岸、是爲密邇、證以去年本埠馬路低處、輙爲陰溝倒灌等情形、似足注意、大通社記者、爰爲親訪濬浦總局總工程師薛卓斌氏、茲誌於后、</p>
<p>長江泛滥浦江無關</p>
<p>大通社記者首叩薛氏以本年七個月以來浦江似尙以本月十九日晨前之潮爲最高、當茲長江洪水適又泛滥、屆時將爲超過預測水位、而致泛岸、據薛氏答謂、如無颶風發生、當不致超過預測水位、至長江泛濫、因本埠地接海濱、如無長時間之東北風吹激、自無關係、</p>
<p>預測九月尙有大潮</p>
<p>記者又叩以本年高潮、在秋迅期中、浦江發潮數量、是否尙有超過本月十九髙潮之一日、薛氏答謂、大致本年國暦九月十四·十五·兩日、沛江尙有校此爲髙之潮水、關於數量、究係若干、則該局此時尙未測定、（薛氏並聲明、其超過數量、亦僅數吋而已）、薜氏繼答記者問、關於浦江</p>
<p>風勢而外氣壓有關</p>
<p>潮水、有時意外暴漲、其原因大致不外受颶風所撳起、同時於氣候極度低壓、亦有相當關係、惟國風得吹經上海、大致以陰歷八·九·兩月機會較多、六七兩月較少、</p>
<p>明日晨前高潮數量</p>
<p>浦江高潮、其所發數量、爲十一呎七吋、距離外灘十三呎江岸、尙有一呎三吋（以十吋爲一呎）、該項髙潮、自十八日午夜開始上漲、十九日中午、大致可完全退落、惟當十九日晨前一時至二時之間、漲勢湍急、行船者不可不注意也、</p>
<h3>昨日平明倩　聞喨烈雷聲　連發兩響相距約五分鐘晴天霹靂本年尙係創聞</h3>
<p>本埠連日氣候炎熱、尤以前日爲最燠悶、因之各時疫醫院、莫不病人激增、中暑者頗多、昨晨平明前四時許、忽發雷聲兩響、前後相距約五分鐘、聲極喨烈、聞之悚然、其時晨光微曦、天際湛湛、不留片雲、是種晴天霹靂、在本年夏季中、尙屬創聞、</p>
<h3>本年洋米入口額驚人　居進口貨首位　本市半年來進口近四千萬元六月份已趨减少値四百餘萬</h3>
<p>本年洋米入口、破近年來之紀錄、爲數極鉅、本市上半年洋米進口總數、達國幣三千八百餘萬元、頗足驚人、佔進口貨之第一位、六月份一月洋米入口較少、居第四位、値四百餘萬元、茲據申時社記者探得各情如下、</p>
<p>進口數額鉅大</p>
<p>本年上半年本市洋米入口、據海關方面之統計、共入口五·三七五·六九〇公担、値關金二一·七〇二·一四九元、合國幣爲三八·一三七·一四二元、佔進口洋貨之第一位、內以安南佔第一位、共三·五八三·四〇一公担、値一四·四三三·三二九關金元、印度居第二位、八九二·六三八公担、値三·九六一·一七六關金元、暹羅第三入口八九二，九七七公担、値三·二七八·六四二關金元、日本二·四三二公担、值一〇·九一三關金元、香港二四二公祖、値一·一七九關金元、</p>
<p>六月份輸入數</p>
<p>六月份一月本市洋米進口、較前已减少、共入口六一九·〇八〇公担、値關二·四二〇·一一四元、合國幣四·〇一九·八〇九元、佔六月份進口貨之第四位、其中安南米輸入四一·六九九公担、値關金一·五五八。四三九元、印度米一一五·〇五一公担、値關金五五二·一九三元、退羅米九三·三二九公担、値關金三〇九·四七六元、此外香港一公担、値關金六元二角</p>
<h3>我國　桐油外銷暢旺　本年來對外貿易躍居首位油商如能覺悟前途尙光明</h3>
<p>桐油爲我國之重要出口商品、歷年對外輸出、民國二十年爲八一八·八七四擔、二十一年爲八〇二·七六八擔、二十二年爲一·二四六·八四七擔、二十三年爲六五二·八三六擔、卽在本年對外貿易　落聲中、輸出亦獨見激增、據海關昨發表本年六個月來油類輸出計達四·三二一·〇四一擔、其中以桐油佔大部竟躍居出口貨之首位、卽較歷年來、亦超增極多、尙不失為對外貿易衰落聲中之一好現象、職是市價飛漲、桐油商多趨利市三倍、惟年來國內銷路、一落千丈、銷數有限、不能左右市面、是今後該業之盛衰、將完全以洋莊銷路之暢淡爲轉移、據桐油業方面息、聞邇來洞油大主顧之美國、需要有增無减、故如桐汕業者能澈底覺悟、不攙假油改進品質、尙不致蹈絲茶之覆轍、</p>

<p>池水鼎沸影響成績</p>
<p>該隊於赴杭前、曾約章風及航空兩隊作友館對抗、到杭後旋接航空隊來函、以近來飛行訓練忙碌、所約作罷、故改於星期六與長風隊作水上游藝表演、而於星期日與長風作正式對抗、第二日之八項對抗賽、雖完全將浙省最髙紀錄打破、但成績尙未達最頂點、（一）因杭州天氣、比上海更熱、賽員精神、極感疲乏、（二）池水受烈日蒸曬、幾成滾水、（三）池水久不更換、混濁不淸、邊綫底綫、不易見到、致影響成績頗多、該項成績、原可於返滬後即行發表、因隊員經劇烈動作後、均感小恙、致遲至今日方始發表云云、</p>
<p>水球賽長風吃鴨蛋</p>

<p>水上游藝精彩奪人</p>
<p>第二節目為縛手足一十五公尺泳、長風俞賽鑑及李應生勝、時間三十秒、次為二人足泳、距離亦爲二十五公尺、中靑梁偉生張榮光組與陸偉傑簡而明組勝、時間二十五秒、再次爲　燭泳、參加者中靑及長風各兩人、惟因是日風勢過大、均遭失敗、僅長風兪寳鑑泳至二十公尺左右、亦遭吹滅、最後花式跳水、兩隊共有十餘人參加、結果中靑老將余榮基發揮其拿手傑作、予杭人以不少好影像、這一大批水裏英雄、鬧得西子心痛頭脹、直至六時許始畢、</p>
<p>省紀錄均擊得粉碎</p>

<h3>誰的力量大（貢獻話）</h3>
<p>— 伊葊</p>
<p>服用國貨，是誰的權力大，以前人家都不在主公，而在主婆：所以東來一個婦女國貨年，西來一個婦女國貨會，婦女爲一家的主持人，她們的權力確乎不小，可是我今天想想，婦女的權力，還不及那烹飪的廚夫，縫衣的成衣匠，建造房屋的水木作頭，供應服役的堂倌，來得更大。這一般人，如果不是拋却良心，知道些樂用國貨的利害，吾想决不會閙出笑話的。目下依我看來，識字敎育普遍以後，無論任何人的知識，當然要高些，愛國的心，當然發皇起來，如果這個廚夫深明大義起來，凡是非國貨的食料，一概不用，倒很有力量的。尤其是裁縫，倘使同業中定一個公約，凡是非國貨的衣料，一概不願承製。這力量是多麽的偉大呢？水木作頭，一向是盈利慣了，可是目下說一句有良心的話，落得來試用國貨。講到堂倌這般人，更不荒謬的，人家不喝冷，他們拚命的來傾銷汽水橘子水，他們不問國貸非國貨，只要多賺錢罷了。有時非國貨飲料要佔到四分之三，這是多麼痛心呢？</p>
<p>廚夫，成衣匠，堂倌，水木作頭，你們都是中國人，中國不景氣如此，你們感覺到這樣？爲國犧牲些，也是値得的啊。須要念着『人生都靠衣食住，未可拋除一片心。』</p>
<h3>努力國貨產銷運動（國貨論壇）</h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>這個世界是什麽世界？我們有口，不許說我們心裏要說的話；我們有手，不許做我們生存競爭上應做的事，我們有足，不許走我們生活奮鬥上應走的路。這個世界，究竟是什麽世界！</p>
<p>別人家表面上抬舉我們，和我們交換大使，提高我們的國際塲面，然而事實上是怎麽樣呢？不要說法國，英國，這些眞正老牌的一等國家，它們對於非本國貨，可以絕對自由地限制進口，來保護本國貨的銷售。便是任何一國的殖民地，例如荷屬東印度，法屬安南，意屬東菲等地，它們不是正式國家，沒有國際地位可言，它們却也可以絕對自由地銷售國產或土產貨品，髙唱抵制某貨。</p>
<p>我們現在國際的塲面是提高了，可是我們是步步如緊地給鄰人綑縛着，替你張冠李戴，替你拕肉補倉。不許你叫一聲屈，喊一聲痛。開着鷄棚門聽黄狼來偸鷄吃，不許你喚一聲。</p>
<p>我們的領海，横着外人的鐵艦；我們的領空，翔着外來的飛機；我們的市場，滿列着各種各式非本國的貨品。別人做好了衣服給我們現現成成地穿；別人種好了米穀，焙好了麫包給我們舒舒服服地吃；別人製好了各種摩登而適用的貨物給我們寫寫意意地用，我們在這世上不是做了個十足地行尸走肉嗎？</p>
<p>我們民族經濟的陣綫，已完全給人衝破了！經濟自衛的壁壘一個個被轟燬了。我們今後只有本手良心，人自爲戰，努力產銷國貨，服用國貨！</p>
<p>「置之死地而後生，置之亡地而後存」。我們現在是站在死地和亡地了，「其亡其亡！繋於苞桑」，出乎良心的人自爲戰，是我們最後自敎的僅有的策略！</p>
<h3>國貨與識字運動（國貨論壇）</h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>在文盲充斥下的中國推行識字敎育，確是刻不容緩的一件工作。因爲識字運動也是國民黨七大運動之一，所以現在上海市政府市黨部等機關，都在積極的進行　掃除全市文盲的偉大工作。據調查所得，目下正在進行籌備的識字學校，已有五百餘所之多，當然這是極好的現象，値得我們的欣慰與贊助！</p>
<p>不過在這識字運動風起雲湧的現在，我認爲與中國生死存亡有關的國貸運動，似乎更不宜漠視，而且我們大可利用這識字運動的機會，來兼做國貨運動的工作。記者始終認爲國貸運動其識字運動是絕對維緊而能相互並進的！</p>
<p>數年來國貨運動沒有顯著的成效，和洋貨的依舊充斥市塲，雖說是由各方面的種種原因所造成的，但是中國敎育的不普及，人民智識稈度低下，對於國家觀念的薄弱，實也造成國貨不振的主因；所以我以爲提倡國貨的首次條伴，還是要普及敎育，提高人民的智識；實施國貨敎育，使中國人民對國貨有相當的認識，從此自動的放棄洋貨，採用國貨。</p>
<p>在這裏，我敢武斷的說一句，大凡入識字學校的學生，大都對國家觀念，非常薄弱，購貨只知以錢易物，在他們簡單的腦筋中，根本沒有什麼國貨外貨的影象，更不知有關國計民生的利害。所以我們現在第一步旣使他們受識字的敎育，進一步就可貫輸他們國貨的智識，現在卽就上海一隅而論，識字學校已有五六百所之多，入學者何止數十萬，假使把各人都養成一種服用國貨的習慣，那國貨運動的前途，不是得着莫大的帮助而頓現曙光嗎？</p>
<h3>為各地國貨公司進忠告（國貨意見）</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>國貨公司在各地風起雲湧般設立，這眞是値得欣喜的一件事情。在春假裏我在各地——杭州蘇州松江——參觀一下，知道這許多貨品都是上海的廠商運去推銷的：因此公司內的一切佈置和設施，甚至職員之對待顧客，都帶些上海商店化。我看了之後，一方感佩他們的熱忱，替國貨作一根中流砥柱；一方也有些許意見，貢獻給他們作參考。</p>
<p>（一）須抱價廉物美的宗旨　「商人將本求利，千做萬做，蝕本勿做」。這句話固然是不錯。不過我們現在爲國貨界奮鬥，須稍盡一些義務，稍放出一些犧牲之心。本雖不蝕，也不可拿次貨當高貨賣，或故意抬髙價格。這種種惡習，旣損商業道德，也喪國貨信譽，切切不可取巧嘗試。因爲上海商家有一種心理，以爲上海人是老門檻，內地人是阿木林，所以到內地去推銷國貨次等貨色，亦滿不在乎。這樣一來，內地的國貨公司，豈不變成了柏賣底貨和次貨的塲所嗎？他們便算不識貨，拿外國貨來比一比，豈不要大呼上當嗎？這樣一來，國貨還會有發展嗎？所以到內地去的廠商，眞的要把「價廉物美四字去實行。</p>
<p>（二）訓練售貨員　上海各商店售貨員的慢客，早已成爲無庸諱言的事實：而各國貨公司也難免這種陋習。虹口的日本商店，他們對於顧客，無論成交不成交，總必鞠躬送至門口：顧客無論若何麻　，他們决不出惡言以報。這種謙和的熊度，我們不必全學，只要有其一半。」已經很好的了。內地商店的售貨員，多少總比上海的謙和一些。倘使上海的售貨員，也到內地去耀武揚威，動不動出口傷人，那末你的貸品雖好，顧客見了這等售貨員，也惟有退避三舍，謹謝不敢的了。所以我以爲到內地去的售貨員，必須嚴格地訓練一下，養成其謙和忍耐的心情，誠懇周到的態度，到內地去做一個模範的售貨員。</p>
<p>（三）革除無謂的宣傳　「生意靠宣傳而發達」。這句話固然不錯。不過宣傳也須有相當的分寸「大减價」「大放盤」這一類幌子，旣已不靈：便是「出賣血本」「賣一尺送五尺」這一類的噱頭，也無人領敎。所以我以爲除了標明價格和說明貨物的功効外，切不可沿用這類的宣傳。還有門口吹着軍樂，敲着大鼓，這一類也成爲俗劣不堪的宣傳品，在內地眞不必玩這一套咧。</p>
<h3>讀「飲料國貨運」後之我感</h3>
<p>— 秉儒</p>
<p>讀了前期本刊仰葊先生一篇「飮料國貨運動」之後，我們爲國貨飮料想，爲我們的民族性講，都不禁威慨係之！爲什麼我們國人尤其是一般摩登哥兒姐兒，酷嗜外貨？試一想國勢的危殆，又豈祇椎心泣血而已，國忘無日，還得做夢似的和外貨做熱烈的推銷者，這不是奴性，還待何說！</p>
<p>我常想我們中國人的好用外貨，別說是對於飮料，無論那一樣東西，總是外貨好，恰和外國人愛用其本國貨卽小至如一根火柴，一支香烟，亦非國貨不行，這樣的相形之下，我們中國人够多麽慚愧！在這炎夏的時候，飮料當然是應時而興，在我看，這些飮料，非生活必要，但旣要吃，則非國貨不可。像啤酒，桔子水，汽水，好的不比外貨差多少，又何必喪心病狂，甘做外貨的順奴？同時對於營國貨飮料的人，切不可以利之所在，就粗製濫造，對於品質，衛生，罔所顧忌，結果，自己旣不蒙其利，反貽國貨界之羞，且堅愛用外貨者之心，這眞是馬虎不得的，還有一點，似乎平淡而實在是最最嚴重的一個問題，就是國貨界對於他的製口歡喜冐充外貨，甚至用洋商名稱發行，以投合國人好用外貨的心理，這樣居然給他計售利得，我認爲這種事對於國人好用外貸的心理，實與有「互爲因果」的關係。在弄此玄虛者，還正以聰明自許，實在是至愚至愚的行爲，也可以說是最可痛心的行爲。我們希望有志氣的國人，有則改之，無則加勉，總之無論對於製造以及發行，要有整個的計劃，繼之以奮鬬的精神，在國人消費者的方面，要快些一致的覺悟，明白自己的責任，眞的到了那「悔之晚矣」的時候，恐怕你要用國貨，亦沒有國貨可用了。</p>
<h3>冷飲品與國貨（國貨談話）</h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>時代的輪子，迅捷地轉到了夏的季節，馬路上已經到處可以看到冰淇淋汽水的廣吿牌子和飄揚在空中的旗識。的確在這樣炎熱的天氣，是誰都需要吃些冷飮品來解解熱的！</p>
<p>不過現在市上所售的汽水和泳淇淋，國貨的固然很多，但是外貨的却也不少。就像現在最普遍銷行於飲冰室和電影院的泳淇淋，都是外商所製造。據記者調査所得，美女牌冰淇淋從前銷數最盛的時候，每天能賣千打左右，計算每打批發價目約合一元六七角之譜，那末中國人每天就有一千六七百元的金錢流到外國人的手裏，日積月累，其數也就很足驚人了！現在銷數雖較衰落，但仍佔冰淇淋銷路的第一位。而且這種冰淇淋的享用者，大都還是布爾喬亞的智識階級，這不得不使我們有些痛心！</p>
<p>在從前，或者還可以說中國的冷飲品是不十分科學化而合於衛生，但是現在我認爲中國工商業雖則仍舊落後，科學雖則還沒有如西洋的發達，不過區區的自造冰淇淋却擔保還能服用，不見得有遜於外貨，那又何必定要服用舶來冰淇淋而使利源外溢呢！</p>
<p>歡喜服用外貨汽水冰淇淋的先生們，在炎熱的夏天，你們能常吃什麽外國的冰淇淋，固能使你凉澈心肺，但是假使你回頭一想，中國國難是如叱的嚴重，外人經濟侵略是如此的利害，而你自己連飮冰之微，也尙不肯服用國貨，那時你良心的內疚，恐怕遍體生凉將變爲汗流浹背哩！</p>
<p>同胞們！假使冰淇淋沒有冰住你的心，凍冷了你的血，那末就請你不再服用外貨的冰淇淋和汽水，中國的冷飮品也足以却熱的呀！</p>
<h3>夏令的國貨用品（國貨談話）</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>一到了夏天，除了洋裝少年摩登小姐以外，普通人穿的用的，倒是國貨居多，這眞是一種好現象。所以夏季也可以稱做國貨季，我也很願其他三季和夏季一般的現象，那末入超的數目，一定會降到低落的度數咧。現在我姑且把夏令的用品，約略說一下吧：</p>
<p>（一）衣料……單薄的衣料，若夏布，香雲紗，紡綢等，倒是道地的國貨。中等的人們，很喜歡穿；而且也有能力穿。至於高貴的小姐們，她們穿的甚麽喬其紗和華而紗等，旣不耐洗，而且又是外貸，眞不及上邊所說那幾種的實在。還有些勞動階級的女子和小孩，他們都穿花標布，那也不是純粹的國貨，我看還是穿土布的好。還有一事，便是夏布近十年來不時行，以致無人穿着，那也是一件痛心的事情。其實夏布輕爽耐洗，我看還在喬其紗華而紗之上。愛國的人們，不妨提倡一下。</p>
<p>（二）草帽軟木帽……草帽有上中下三等：上等的是金絲草做成，是否純粹國貨，我却有些懷疑，中等和下等的是用麥桿製成，我國已能自製，其中雖攙雜一些外貨原料，（橡皮圈等）可說是國貨了。還有近來盛行的軟木帽，好的是用軟木作墊，雖是國人自製，不過原料還是外貨。下等的是硬紙板作襯，多少也攙雜一些外貨原料在裏邊。</p>
<p>（三）扇子……上等的人家，都使用電風扇，那電扇國人多能自製了。不過國人又有一種外貨迷的心裏，所以購買外貨的居多。普通所用的竹骨扇，鵝毛扇，絹扇蒲葵扇等，那倒是純粹的國貨，所以在這點上國人倒很可以自誇的。</p>
<p>（四）飮料……菓子露，汽水，冰淇淋等，雖免不掉攙雜一些外貨原料，可是國人已能自製，所以也可以說外貨並不得勢。而且這些冷飲品是銷售於高貴的人們，普通的人們，仍舊靠着西瓜綠豆湯一類解暑，這點倒也不足為慮的。</p>
<p>（五）蚊香……鄉間仍在用着硫磺和木屑做的蚊香，他們貪着價賤，也顧不得衛生不衛生了。都市裏所用的是用除蟲菊製成，效騐很巨，又合衛生，而且又是國貨，外貨竟無厠足的餘地咧。</p>
<h3>値得介紹的一個團體（國貨消息）</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>頃接蚌埠舊友張君來函：述及該地近有熱心同志，組織市民勸用國貨實行團，附有簡章信條等印刷品，囑代宣傳，展誦之下，覺値得介紹，爰特摘錄一二如下：（一）緣起內以外貨傾銷，如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，輾轉相循，工商業益趨疲蔽，若不急起提倡國貨，則金錢流出甚鉅，將有不堪收拾之勢，我人懍國家興亡匹夫有責之意，力刷五分鐘熱度之恥，組織是團，以免國貸運動，在蚌埠地方落後，故以各人之力量，爲實際之勸告，不尙空談，不唱高調，互相顯砥，互相推進，由個人而及家庭，由家庭而及社會等主張。識見高超；洞悉弊病，苟能脚蹈實地，從事推進，收效之宏，可操左券，與一般專做嘴上功夫，而不肯埋頭苦幹以身作則者，不可同日而語。（二）章程內規定該團除努力提倡國貨外，其他社會事項，概不聞問，與該團經費純由熱心者自動籌助，不向外界募捐，及盡力勸吿親友，一律服用國貨，不特力嬌以團體爲背景，而活動個人，借此斂錢沽名者之弊病，並且不肯獨善其身，處處從勸吿方面着想，具有苦口婆心之意，人非木石，頑石尙能點頭，積久勢必感化，由一而十，由十而百，全體團員皆能遵守此項章程，市上外貨絕跡，不抵制而自抵制矣。（三）信條中如個人及家庭，以愛用國貨爲主體。勸婦女勿用外國化妝品，不吸外國烟，不飮外國酒，隨時勸人提倡國貨，勸吿商店職員盡力推銷國貨，應牢記工商業不振，及農村衰落之危機，購買外國貨，雖一分錢也要注意，不要忽略這是一件小事等語；處處想到，含有啟發思想，令人默念此信條時，如鋩刺在背，應深自警戒，（四）各種標語，除寫成觸目驚心之句語外邊上印有「義美齋國貨毛邊紙印刷上海森記紙廠出品」等字樣。是以身作則的好榜樣，令人一望而知中國紙廠雖不多，但欲印標語之數尙有不必一定要用來路貨之紙張，一言蔽之各省市縣，苟能均有是項勸用國貨實行團，則海關貿易冊上之入超數目字，不特不再增加，並且可以低落，希望各地熱心同志，一致起來組織，莫讓蚌埠一處專美於前，不禁引領翹首而待。</p>
<h3>改良粗紙以救農村之我見（國貨研究）</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>我國人有十男九痔；十女九帶之病，大都由於所用粗紙，內含石灰甚多，未能漂凈之故，造紙用料，無論稻草，麥桿樹皮麻皮，竹籜，以及玉蜀黍之包皮等等，凡欲取其纖維（卽煮不化之筋絡）必用强鹻性物，腐爛其皮肉，並溶解其脂肪，始能達其目的，任何鹻性物之最廉者，實無過於石灰，故用石灰以醃紙料，實爲古法，但必因其相傳已久，手續上只圖省便，遂致失其本耳，以我之見，其作用，並不在於石灰，而在另一物中，取其精華而棄糟粕，人蓋未之察耳，厥物維何，則卽桑柴，或稻草，麥桿，豆莢，棉子壳，艾蓬，樹葉，雜草等等之用爲燃料時，積取其灰，以水浸出汁湯，是皆「炭酸鉀」之原料品也，於此灰汁中，加入「生石灰」，則發熱沸騰，而起交換作用，一方成「炭酸鈣」之沉澱，而一方則成「苛性鉀」之溶液，其方程式如左，</p>
<p>觀於上述，足知腐蝕之功用，全在苛性鉀，而不在於石灰，且石灰已成炭酸鈣，若令包被物面，反足以保護物質抵抗腐蝕，故必去其沈澱但用其上淸液以浸植物，則成品之中，可以不含石灰，且淸液之中，仍不免有水化石灰在，尤當用鹽滷或食鹽少許，加入其中，使起變化，一方成「鹽化鈣」爲可溶解性，庶免包蔽於物，而一方則成「苛性鈉」以助腐蝕之功，其方程如左，</p>
<p>觀於上述，足知石灰全歸無用，不過取其一份之養，使與（輕二養）化合以成苛性用爲交換之媒介品耳，依此方法，所成之紙，其性質必軟而細，但其配合用量如何，必爲作業者所求知，而其實多用少用，毫無關係，不過多用爲不經濟，少用則爲放棄而已，茲爲詳述如左，</p>
<p>灰汁之量，以灰加水，滿過二三寸爲度，假定A爲漏底之池，其旁有閘，閘中攔以篾墊或蒲蓆，閘外爲溝，使流出之汁水，另貯於B池，則取B池中之灰汁，盛於長約尺餘之竹筒中，卽可用「蒲梅氏比重表」量之，大抵不過五度，是知五度者，其中所含炭酸鉀之成分，等於百分之五，如爲三度，則卽百分之三，A池中之濕炭，雖已去汁，但仍可以壅田，蓋卽「加里性肥田粉」也，帶水之石灰脚，亦可壅田，凡泥土過實者，得此可變爲鬆與用石膏相反，至於炭酸鉀與生石灰之配合量，當如左，</p>
<p>每用固體炭酸鉀一百斤，應用生石灰五十六斤，但石灰中每含求經燒透之石質，故不妨用六十斤，以便容易推算，今如灰汁比重爲五度，卽一百斤中只含五斤而已，應用石灰，祇需三斤已足，多用卽爲浪費，少用則爲放棄有效成分，均不合算，最簡便之計算方式，卽以木桶盛水，稱其重量若干，後傾其水，但稱木桶，除去木桶之重量，卽知水重若干，假定爲一百斤，乃於此桶之中，換貯灰汁，稱重若干，除去木桶之重量，卽知灰汁比水加重若干，如眞水重百斤，而同量之灰汁，重至一百零五斤時，是卽等於「蒲梅氏表」之五度，竟可無須購表，亦能知其含量之比重矣。</p>
<p>造紙用料，不論爲稻草，麥桿，樹皮，竹籜，麻絲，破布，等等每重百斤，應用苛性鉀，不過十五斤，但寗可使過量以取速腐，則加二成之量，應用十八斤爲適當，上述之五度灰汁百斤，加入生石灰三斤，所成之上淸液中含有苛性鉀亦不過三斤，是則紙料百斤，卽應配用上淸液六百斤，其中方有十八斤之苛性鉀含量，此六百斤之灰汁，並不値錢，所値錢者，不過十八斤之生石灰耳，石灰之價，每擔不過一元二角，且是雙斤秤，每斤不過六釐，十八斤作二十斤論，亦祇一角二分而已，比用苛性鈉二十五磅之力相同，其成本之廉，良不可以道里計也。</p>
<p>稻草等物，本不値錢，因其龐大，運力甚昂，故在都市中之價値，卽與任何燃料相等，每百斤乃需三角以上，若在鄉間，可取茅屋上換下之腐草，則價必廉而且容易腐爛，每百斤姑以一角二分論，則連石灰之價，共不過二角四分，成料約得三十五斤，以對工對料論，是則每百斤之紙料，但售一元四角足矣，每以一千六百八十斤爲一噸，是不過廿四元耳，若以篩漉之成餅如豆餅然，曝乾成綑，與造紙廠合作，利用機力以造粗紙，論其消費之量卽四萬萬人，每人每日用一張，亦可觀矣，合作方式，宜於售價中派分成數，或以原料與成品，爲物物交換之式，則雙方皆得便利，若認紙廠爲大買主，則外國廠家可放三對月賬，而且無庸加工精製，卽可直捷變錢，欲其舍彼就此，非有大資本之組織不能與之對抗，故我以爲當從粗紙改良合作入手，則咄嗟之間，可成事實，不致永在夢想中也，救濟農村，抵制舶來品之草紙以及機製灰報紙，實惟有此一條生路，奈何不自奮作，徒喚奈何，其愚誠不可及也，實深惜之，病中作此，或許認爲遺囑預言，視同劉基一般之讖語，有識者必能一旦豁然，使我四千餘年之造紙業，不致竟歸淘汰，則吾目瞑矣，乙亥天貺節誌於西湖南山路之蝶莊，如願合作，可與無錫惠商橋利用造紙廠直接，恕不作寫書郵也。</p>

<p>無軌電車活像一隻箱子，容量極小，但總滿滿地擠着人。座位上不消說是難得空的，就是籐圈上也總弔着一條條細白的或粗黑的手臂。有時候更擠得利害，弄到女人也沒有人讓坐，藤圈也沒有弔，只東撞西碰地投在人家懷裏，小夥子自然樂開啦，不過年事老些的人也會發出警吿：</p>
<p>——當心扒兒手呀！人擠，賊骨頭就要上來哉啊，大家當心自家格袋袋呵</p>
<p>可是人越擠，賣票的便越加好揩油，他的眼睛不住地向站上探着，肚子裏不住地在計算着，手裏不住地在播弄着票子或銅子，把下車人手裏的票子收回來，再塞給出了銅子還沒有票子的客人。有時為彌補破綻起見，更得向別的乘客們互相掉換，總努力使每張票子的途程與票價符合，不使査票的看出。等到乘客稍微少了一點的時候，他彷彿很難為情地用食指敲敲自己的太陽穴，强笑着說。</p>
<p>——頭也痛殺快哉！</p>
<p>一位著黑印度綢長衫的乘客却接上去說：</p>
<p>——頭末痛，銅錢也賺得寫意格！</p>
<p>賣票員索性老着面皮來答覆了：</p>
<p>——碰着客人好末，還好；碰着壞點個客人，就要罵山門哉。賺兩個銅錢也弗容易——</p>
<p>話還不曾說完，新世界站又到了；他把剛剛討到的一張頭等票子，塞給了一位剛上車的三等客人，似乎是好意地請他到頭等去坐，那客人倒反而給弄得莫名其妙哩。</p>
<p>坐無軌電車，雖然很不舒服，但却能看到幅幅浮世畫。</p>
<h3>黑白分明</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>賞鑒每個藝術展覽會，我想任何人是為了在這沉悶的時代享受一些心境的淸凉：黑白社三屆影展的引力吸我到那會塲去觀光。很巧的碰到該社的主幹陳傳霖君，一別兩年，旁的話莫待說，先去看他的幾十幅出品；「獨樂樂」，是一個鵝兒正在撲撲學蝴蝶兒飛，周圍水浪一環一環地，十分生動。更妙的是上角還有兩道長短不齊的黑影漾着，彷彿是岸上柳絲或水中蘆葦的倒影，充滿了詩情畫意。</p>
<p>看到盧施福的攝物，有一幅「弄潮兒」，在談音中又刺探得是在驚濤駭浪中拍回岸上的景物，在平凡的題材中表現出新頴。</p>
<p>晨雲的姿態，秋雨的氣息，和輕顰淺笑的曲線，在過去的攝物中領略得太多了：本屆黑白展中有幾位新進的藝人出品，如：「麥管」「圖案」「過去的事實」等，富於圖案攝影趣味，都創造的淸新可喜。</p>
<p>這，就是我對於黑白三屆影展的特寫！總而言之，全部的出品，都是「黑白分明」。</p>
<p>臨了，我驀地想起了有悠久歷史而沉沉酣睡的華社；在這兒謹以一瓣心香，企待着他們的舉行展覽，使中華影藝的園地，迅速地開拓！名震宇宙！</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　廉幕隱啼痕難逃冷限衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>那位新娘子。這時可露了面了，手掀了門簾子，有大半截身子，在門簾子縫裏。而同時也就看到他的臉色，似乎由黃瘦方面，帶了一分憔悴。兩隻眼睛泡，彷彿都有些浮腫。於是就想到他臉上那憔悴的顏色，和若隱若隠若顯斑痕，好像都是眼淚所沾染的了。他倒不是在這裏偷看志前，却是在　邊張望著茶房。及至發現了志前也在人叢中看報以後，他立刻身子向裏一縮，將門簾放下來了。志前想看，這倒不必在這裏只管去窺探他。他不解窺探人的意思，或者要認為別人是有意調戲他的。於是放下報不看，走出小西天大門外去了。到了下午四點鐘，差不多吃晚飯的時候，也方才走回去。可是一到那最後一進的院子裏，沒有進得房去，就讓張介去截住來談話了。他今天格外穿得端整，在長衫外面，再加了一件馬褂。那頂古銅色的呢帽，也不像往日七顛八倒的戴在頭上，四週的邊沿，非常的整齊，繞着腦袋轉一個圈。帽子項上那一道折縫，和鼻子成了一直綫。臉上是不必說，更是正正當當的向人看着，沒有一些子不正確的顏色。本來志前也不注意到他的顏色上去，只是他把人攔住，不能不理他。他站得定了，然後舉了馬褂袖子，作了兩個揖。志前這可有些茫然了，他為什麽施上這一禮？便只好站定了，也回他一個揖。（二六八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>然而難保伊不把這事牢記在心，永遠當我是一個有罪的人，只消遇到任何一次相巧的機會，便舊事重提的將我一併處責起來，豈不敎我有寃難伸？</p>
<p>「我實在不知道啊！」我帶着哀懇的語氣，再向那女官問道：「那末就請你告訴我，究竟該受何等的責罰啊？」</p>
<p>「殺頭！」</p>
<p>啊！這可眞要把我嚇死了！雖然老佛爺當面是沒有給我說過什麽話，但是也許伊此刻早有懿旨下去了，到明天早上，說不定我就要給他們抓去殺頭了！</p>
<p>「可是你知道我祇是一片好心，為伊老人家的寒熱還不曾退，所以才勸阻伊的！」我於是就忙着把眞情吿訴那女官，大有希望伊能可憐我，給我想法子排解排解的意思。「我何嘗是存心想違旨呢？」</p>
<p>「好吧！你且留心着！如今呢，老佛爺正在寵愛你的當兒，多半是可以不追究的；但是誰人敢保得定你能永遠的受伊寵信呢？而這一回事又是斷不能使伊老人家忘掉的。—到得那時候，我瞧你再有什麽聰明的方法，能使你的腦袋留在頸上不吊下來？你不是以為自己是最聰明的嗎！」（三六八）</p>

<h3>御醫之苦况</h3>
<p>— 吳愛伯</p>
<p>本刋「御香縹緲錄」，近日連載西太后患病御醫四人跪而診脈之怪狀，讀之令人失笑。專制之朝，臣下之事君上，其苦况有如此者，誠非吾輩共和之民所能夢見也。</p>
<p>頃閱「烟靄晴暉都好齋筆記」，中有一段，亦記為御醫者之苦况，謂出自某老太醫（卽御醫）之口，可為「御香縹緲錄」添一佐證，錄之如下：</p>
<p>友人房君言，昔嘗就醫於一老人，譚次審曾為太醫，因叩以宮中事。老人曰：供奉不易為也，吾年逾五十，始補官，入值視諸曹為最苦，居輙三日留，破曉卽整朝服坐，然或竟日無事，而逾子方敢寐，以密邇宮掖，所居卽乾淸門側也。，門禁凡生鬚男子，不經宣召，闌入者死，是以伏處不敢少游散。或入夜方欲睡，忽有內監出宣，卽攝衣隨之。殿陛高峻，徑復曲折，只內監携絳紗小燈，光至微暗，其徑熟，行絕速，竭蹶隨至，則汗下坌息焉。若在宮卷，尙可坐診，一夕膺帝召，入，跪榻前切脈，而喘息幾不自勝。帝語曰；何戰慄乃爾？面朕猶然，朝他人當驚惕死矣。實則寅畏之懷，竟不若趨走之勞，亦惟以尺咫天顏震越失次對。旣出，就廡下脈案方劑進，藥否未可知，而常有賜賚每領於內務府，輒需例銀，賞物且潛易，而薄祿幾因而罄焉。所譚蓋光緒間事，眞不啻白髮梨園，按舊日霓裳也。</p>
<p>吾嘗謂吾國之注重於切脈，其一由於醴敎，其二由於政體，觀「御香縹緲錄」及烟靄晴暉都好齋筆記」所言，可知吾言之非妄也。</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>閔行雨游</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>上　個星期六。蔭之兄要到上海中學去望望劍雲先生的文郎，我承他終了一同去，　為上海中學在漕河涇的西南，距離閔行已不恨遠了。當我們出發的時候，天氣還非常的亮，一些沒有雨意，同去的還有蔭兄的少君，和一位姓孫的先生。</p>
<p>從前聽說閔行　地方，有小上海之稱，雖則去上海有四五十里地，據說那裏的風物是很不差的。我們行四人，在上海中學出來，車首南指，開足速力，飛也似的直放目的地而去。</p>
<p>可是，不宰得很，也許，這不幸，在鄕裏人口中還要額手稱慶呢！這短短的旅途中，很不客氣的傾盆大雨下來了。車子在滬閔公路上，倒還不感到什麽，僅僅車篷水林。各人的衣帽沾濕而已。隔不多久，閔行是到了，駕駛人對於這裏的塗徑也不大熟悉，而自任響導的孫先生，還是二十年前來過一次，此刻已大為改觀，所以，他也有些認不得了。</p>
<p>車子停在黃沛灘頭水碼頭相近的地方，雨，一陣緊一陣的下着，蔭兄很想掉頭回去，那知老興勃發的孫先生，一個勁兒的說：「旣來之則安之」，這兒有的是好酒館，我們何不歇上一歇呢！我倒無可不可的，於是冒雨下車，可笑市鎮在那裏還沒有找到，我們沿着黃浦望西走了三四百步，各人的內衣也都濕透，非但望去沒有店面，連人面也衝不到一個，恰巧在進退兩難的時候，有一個水手似的船老大，朝我們走來，問了他一個信，才知市鎭須往東南首行，我們正背道而馳，莫怪愈走愈不對了。</p>
<p>那個船老大倒很好，他說；你們何不先在前面一家「民敎館」去泡碗茶吃，等雨停了，再到鎭上去不好嗎？於是就聽了他，走到離停車地方沒有一箭遠近的民敎館，那地方是劃一部份賣茶的，挺潔凈。門楣墻壁，雖則寫的「民敎」的許多標語和圖畫，而大多數的民衆就是一輩茶客。孫先生打聽了茶博士？才曉得此間有挺漂亮的跳舞塲，廣東的年靑舞女，所做的全是船上的水手和外國人生意，孫先生雙足有些躍躍欲試，使性子拉我們上跳舞塲去，幸而有一輛包車來攬他的生意，拉車的說，跳舞還早，這時候要不要先兜全鎭一轉。再上火山不遲。我同蔭兄也慫恿他，於是，他坐了全鎭僅有的一輛包車，馬世兄也跟他坐在一起，我們倆向茶館裏借到了兩柄雨傘，老孫還想去訪酒館子呢，我倆跟在車子後面，冒雨游街，徒步而行。那知，全鎭三條街都跑下來。沒有一家好好的酒館的，原來也是「傳聞失實」了。</p>
<p>全鎭市容很不差，各式的店也都有，一下雨，生意也消了。店夥們大都扒在櫃檯上看雨景。</p>
<p>這樣的三條街跑完，雨還是不住，時候却快垂暮了。大家重新坐上汽車，呌他快回上海，那知老孫還以未上火山為大「掃興哩」。</p>
<h3>枉費千元</h3>
<p>— （映煇）</p>
<p>某君。於數年前。曾經踄足花叢。染得五淋白濁之症。東西就醫。終鮮效果。自罹患以來。時發時愈。醫藥所費。何止千元。遂感經濟据拮之困苦。惟有置不之醫。然而病毒在身。無惡不作。近且變本加厲。小便中時有血液之混在。週身骨節痠痛。睪丸腫大。步履之際。不勝其苦。少腹膀胱之部。時感脹痛。小便遺瀝。某君深感病苦之難受。思欲繼續醫藥。又恐仍如前之失望。徒耗金錢。不醫則長此遷延。明知對於健康前途。完全失望。正在無可進退之際。偶見報載有上海法大馬路。西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社。經售之治淋聖藥。哥那多登」者。每盒二元。因購而試服之。果一盒服完。病勢大减。二盒而病告安全。為求穩妥計。再購服一盒。則數年痼疾。從此根治。某君深感哥那多登之靈效。故其知友間之有患淋濁者。無不轉　介紹。而均獲藥到病除者。故某君謂「哥那多登」。如果早日岀而問世。　我昔日之枉費千元云。</p>
<h3>優劣立見</h3>
<p>— （君謀）</p>
<p>有某女士者。曾患赤白帶下之症多年。因害醜心重。故絶未就醫。祗購市售治赤白帶之成藥服用。不下數十種之多。毫無效騐。近更影響全身衰　。以致面黄肌瘦。食慾不振。少腹脹痛。腰痠肢軟。值此夏季輕衣單薄之時。尤盛困苦。蓋以赤白帶下之症。不止汚及小褲而已也。有時累及外衣。亦被汚染。更覺難堪。如果常以月經帶之類以緊縛之。又感悶熱不爽。普通婦女之在炎夏。即健狀態之月經時數天。尚感下部之不適。何况所患赤白帶下之症。一日不除。即一日不能舒適也。某女士果不勝其苦矣。某日有女友自申歸。見女士而問曰。姊何如此之面黄肌瘦耶。女士曰。曾患赤白帶下之症多年。服過市售成藥不下數十種之多。毫無效果。精神上既感痛苦。思想上復感沉悶。安得不瘦耶。女友曰。何不早日告我。當不致若此也。我自身亦曾經此症。經服用上海法租界寧波路六十四號。孫緯才父子醫院岀售之内服白帶丸。與外用白帶藥。所費不過每種二元。而今已根治矣。某女士聞之。遂亦郵購數盒。如法服用。此多年痼疾。竟旬日而治。於此可證市售成藥之優劣立見矣。</p>

<h3>糧食　客帮爭裝本月份</h3>
<p>昨粉市一致騰漲、以洋麥報價、雖上落甚微、芝加哥近好四分、遠跌一角另、坎拿大好四分故初開時、人心尙定、惟本月份因長江一路、如九江漢口長沙、均以水災之故、頗有辦裝、天津帮亦因人心轉佳、亦繼起吸進、致市面步開步佳、至收盤之最髙價、提至三角四分二厘半、較之週初、計回漲五六分、至遠期各月份、市面亦佳、不過廠方亦趁勢出檔、漲度遂不及本月份、此後情形、如實銷續動、洋麥未有軋脚、本月份或須提高也、結果本月份較漲二分半、八月份漲二分二厘半、九月份漲一分七厘半、十月份漲一分、十一月份漲七厘半、十二月份漲一分二厘半、</p>
<h3>遠期麥浮空抵補</h3>
<p>昨麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近疲遠穩之象、本月份因受現麥之積壓、在廠胃呆頓之時、自然難以振作、故喊價步軟、至遠期各月份、以拋戶見稀、又因浮空抵補、人心比較穩住、且最近匯市較緊、或者洋麥兜售、暫可停止、是以市氣較定也、結果本月份跌四分、八月份漲二分、九十月份漲一分、現麥市面、廠方仍未全動、市勢髙貨轉穩、中次仍數、開山東麥三元三角八九分、瑤灣洋河麥三元三角八分、次六分、明光麥三元三角七分、烏衣麥三元三角四分、髙郵麥三元三角一分、江新州麥三元三角、次二角九分、和州麥三元一角七分、邵伯麥三元二角八分、五河麥三元三角三四分、鎮江麥三元二角二分、次二角、由福新去七千包、</p>

<p>天熱囤米急於求售</p>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各帮來源與前相仿、仍衹到十來號、故雖本街銷化續滯、靑島烟台等帮繼辦四五百包、市况得以保持、計各厚粳及薄稻等行情、髙料者仍定、僅中市者再貶數分至角砠、至若陰變元、亦然平疲、（滬北）各路來源十一二號、市上去胃白粳略爲轉鮮、價形定局、薄稻零胃仍滯、價形鮮者定勢、中次者價小一二角、早稻取短價者稍化、市形髙小尺許、宿次者其價所小不一、白元逐日修削不堪、店方進胃轉活、致價轉漲三四角不等、</p>
<p>洋米市况、繼續步跌、良以邇日天氣過炎、囤戶貨主均以心虛求脫、兼之河廠各米狂跌於前、洋米不免受其影響、囤戶更多貶價求售、行情乃見繼續跌下一角至數分不等、午後以長江去化活潑、跌勢已定、惟去數不多、市面未克轉機、全市開出西貢四千五百包、髙貢小絞暑　三千包、由漢口沙市九江寗波南京內地本街等分去云、</p>

<h3>南北貨　湘蓮頗受水災損害</h3>
<p>湘蓮自產地水災以來、市勢步漲、據昨漢訊、冲九溪蓮辦價、巳暴漲至三十六七元、衡州蓮該處存貨雖有、惟成本昂貴、不肯裝漢、常德蓮因水災收成大減、損失最重、後市尙有續企之可能、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油站在四十元關口</h3>
<p>白桐油本月國外去路、似較上月爲懈、上週以來、洋行辦貨更無大票、致價格每擔由四十三元現已跌至四十元二三角、因每屆夏令、恒不及春冬之盛、共所以尙能維持四十元一關者、蓋因產地存積不厚、漢市來源亦無往年之盛、不至暴跌、職是故也、亦似無再跌之可能、</p>

<p>花園鉛絲新近到貨充斥、出路開散、標準每扎守二元九角、比之先前又跌一角、聞大批行情尚可低落、昨日交易祗七八十扎、有建築帮辦去、　元邊釘、自北帮停辦後、長江路受水災影響、供過於求、步步下降、如三分沒箱開四十元、四分三十九元、五分三十八元、六分三十七元五角、七八十扎、</p>

<h3>小戲所表現的世界</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>是陶庵夢憶裏面吧，記鄉間賽會，派人四出去搜求扮演水滸傳戲文的人物，曾有人覺得這種閒散而又頂眞的心情，頗可羨美。不過其所搜求得的人物，是否眞如所描寫的那樣生龍活虎，似很可懷疑。梅蘭芳的演戲，被一些人捧得如何美妙，然而有人說他不相信楊貴妃眼睛會那樣鈍，嘴唇會那樣厚，却是更可相信的。固然演戲原只能達某種程度的像眞，形貌態度的十分逼似，本是不可能的，但演戲旣以再現一個人為目的，眞是太難再現的人物，戲劇中就每每避免。</p>
<p>歷史上的故事很適宜於編戲劇，但是歷史戲劇却極不容易編好，演好。近代劇作家大槪除是用特別眼光描繪某一歷史人物以外，都不寫歷史劇了。古代的歷史要比較多得多。中國古代戲劇，更簡直是以歷史為主要題材。就並非眞實的歷史上的故事，也每每根據着別的已成故事而來。譬如水滸，紅樓夢中的故事，故事本身，雖出創造，而因這些書給人的印象太深，要把其中的故事編成戲劇，是和用歷史故事編劇有同樣困難的。</p>
<p>由歷史劇之多，似可說歷史劇很受人歡迎，及一般人對歷史劇頗有會心。但我總以為這是觀衆受劇作家支配，而劇作家所為寫作的對象，却並不是一般人。在中國未有成形的戲劇以前，在話就已開了戲劇故事的局格。說話人的家數，是各為其一班聽衆的，因爲有一班佛敎信徒，所以有談經，因為有一斑風流子弟，所以有銀字兒，因為多的是游勇流氓，所以有鐵騎兒，公案。至於講史畫，則大致是投讀書人的嗜好，而合生或者才是家常瑣話為一般人而設。如果合生眞是最通俗的，勢力當會逐漸擴大，後來評話中的瑣屑故事的逐漸加多，頗可認為是這種趨勢的證明，不過合生之名，不曾隨以俱傳。實在合生這一名，也很不可解，在當時說不定並不是說話中的正式一家，僅僅是民間自生的一種說話而已。</p>
<p>承襲都會的評話而成的戲劇，故事仍偏向烟粉，公案，鐵騎，但是民間大槪總也自有其戲劇。中國戲劇的來源是以前者或後者為先，似頗可當作一個問題，不過這裏並不想加以考慮，因為我對於各種地方土戲，實在不大了解。僅僅花鼓戲是常聽人提起，並且自己也替人在漢口收集過花鼓戲本，從花鼓戲中，也就看得出這種超出民間的戲劇，其題材就都是日常事件。把辭店那樣的劇本和沈從文所寫的湘西風土的小說印證，還可看出那些戲一定源出湘西。至於喻老四那樣的戲，則其戲情簡直是各地日常都會有的。更如拔麻也可寫戲，下茅房也可寫戲，單純簡陋，誠然是太單純簡陋，但實在也表現出鄉村的生活，鄉村就是這樣的單調，只有老三老四，而並無武松林黛玉。</p>
<p>花鼓戲中不知道有沒有王婆罵雞這齣戲，平劇徽劇中是有的，鄉下特別稱這類為小戲，演起社戲來，正戲四闋照例非大戲不可的，後四闋戲劇，則大都是小戲了。正戲是給神看的，小戲倒正是給人看，這就見小戲戲比較受人歡迎。老實，鄉下人所接觸的僅是這類生活，自然只能了解這類戲的？雖然最近並沒有看至社戲，然而回到鄉間，終日都爲小孩打一架而爭吵，為失去一把蒲扇而爭吵，爭吵得鬼哭神嚎，天翻地覆，彷彿世界僅僅只為這些而存在，駡雞的戲劇，眞如時時都在目前，不禁想這小戲的價値，或不下於阿Q正傳。有人說過，駡雞是無可發洩時的發洩，這固是憤語，但再想到駡雞確是許多人的實生活，則該不僅是可憤而是可悲吧！</p>
<h3>小徑幽情</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>因為學校里上半天有功課，每天早上照例是起得很早的，洗過了臉，吃了一點早點，就抱着書包去上課，我的住所離車站約有一里路遠，要經過許多綠蔭的小徑才能走到車站，雖然每天老是走着這些路，可是我對於這小徑中的一樹一草都生了一點情感，淸早上的空氣是那麽新鮮那麽甜，小石子的路是那麼濕濕的，一些飛塵也沒有，如果是昨晚下過小雨的話，你還可以看見一粒粒地雨珠綴在嫩綠的葉子上，被太陽照着發出一種銀色的光，這景緻常會把人的思想引到極遙遠極微細的境界里去。</p>
<p>每到星期天，大淸早上我總歡喜一個人在這些小徑上走，走着，想着，想自己歡喜想的那些事件，有的時候，那些葉子的氣息，那些泥土的氣息，會變成了一種特有的氣味吹向你鼻子里來，這種氣味說牠芬芳也不是，說牠渾濁也不是，不過，你嗅到牠心頭會感到一點愉快的。</p>
<p>這些小徑上，在靜夜里獨自一個人走，好像不很適宜，並不是怕鬼或怕什麼，總覺得靜夜里一個人走，有許多寂寞的手去招誘人的心似的，或許會使你感到生命的空虛和自身的渺小，所以最好是伴着二三知己，在這小徑上慢步，淡些往事，談些未來，那是最適宜沒有了。</p>
<p>住在都市的中心區的人，好些人全不知道早晨是什麽東西，早上的風，早上的葉子的氣息，早上的甜的空氣，與他們全都沒有份，這份福要住在郊外的人們才能享受到的，住在上海的人自然更夢想不到了。</p>
<p>以前我住在上海，總是九點十點鐘才能起床的，其實早起來又有什麽用處呢？看不到一點綠的東西，吸不到一點新鮮的空氣，全是洗馬桶的聲音與怪的臭味，所以還不如躱在床上，追憶着昨宵的夢境來得好。在上海住了好多年，從沒有一次看到初出的紅日，現在想來，應該承認是遺憾的。</p>
<p>自從來到東京以後，又恢復了往昔在故鄉時那種對於早晨的愛好心，每天早上伴着紅日一同起來，氣分是十分爽快的。在小徑上走着，有的時候悠風送來一陣花香，常會懷疑自己或許住在深山中的。</p>
<p>不過，感到不快的是：常常看見許多小飛蟲在自由自在地飛着，一不當心，就落在蜘蛛早已預設的網上，由於這一點就使人聯想到現實的社會上。這社會又何常不一樣呢，到處都埋伏着陷阱，埋伏着網，一不留心，就落在陷阱里去了。</p>
<p>陷阱，網，佈滿了這社會任何一個角落里，來捕捉小飛蟲似的那些未入世故的年靑人的。</p>
<h3>駐綦江縣</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>……山地雜寫之二</p>
<p>都市的煩悶，給了我們以一種膩厭，無論在生活上或感受上，那死了的情緒會緊緊地撲上了心頭，這樣，新的企求便會咬着我們，不但沒有方法去擺脫，反要漸續的增長。</p>
<p>可是，當新　的山色跳進了我們的眸子，按晚，這新的賜予總該引起了欣幸，然而，山色的新麗，也總是那樣一律，接觸了附天以後，一切又都不足誇耀了。</p>
<p>——人，就是這樣，在無窮盡的企望中生存着，也在無窮盡的希求中消滅下去。不由的。我想了一下。</p>
<p>天上的日頭，掛上西山脚了，山腰上的樹叢幌着，晚霧迷蕩了這靜肅的山窩，黃昏的暮色是多難描繪呵！</p>
<p>白天，六月的大暑天，熱的程度是可以的，但一到傍晚時候，熱的氣息在山吼谷應下一點都不見了。那正是上絃，月亮像淑女的眉弔在空虛的天上，幾片白雲浮來浮去，從柔和的懷埋裏，看見了綦江的縣城。</p>
<p>——黃大老爺。住城裏城外？打先鋒的一個伕子問。</p>
<p>——你說那里好，張伕頭？老黃翻過險來問後面的小頭目。</p>
<p>——那還不隨便，橫豎這兒的客棧都差不多。張伕頭頓了一下又說：不過，城裏有點悶氣，還是城外頭明天好走路。</p>
<p>決定了，劉伕頭在後面也跟上來，忽忙的往前跑去，喊着：</p>
<p>——綦江落棧，一個不够兩個，小五，毛頭，聽見沒有？</p>
<p>先頭人馬已拐進了城門外的那條長街，浩浩蕩蕩地，我們緊跟着。</p>
<p>街上的人，站了兩個行列，嘴裏不知喞咕點什麼，火油的燈光射到了他們的身上，那不同的醬紫色的臉堂，也刻劃着不同的想念。</p>
<p>客棧，眞不能算小，一速兩進正房統統的佔住了，照舊的，把舖蓋由轎子里拉了出來，攤到床上，第一件需要解决的，當然是吃飯問題。計算一下，出了重慶，到現在已是第三天了，伕子們是有規定的，大站打靶（註）在他們的心里已成了急切的需求。本來，上脚（註）一天五六毛錢，除了吃飯抽烟喝茶等等開銷，再除了伕頭預先扣存的準備錢（註）以外，簡直的沒有餘錢能供給他們吃一點較好的油水，那醬紫的色彩里，包藏了營養不足的鐵靑。</p>
<p>——黃大老爺。張伕頭進來了，掛着滿臉的笑。</p>
<p>——要牙祭錢是不？</p>
<p>伕頭沒有說什麽，難以出現的酒渦到現在是露了出來。老黃瞅了他一眼說：「要牙察會笑，抬起東西只會哼哼。」其實，老黃不是不知道他們的苦痛的，假使不這樣，被他們看出了自己的外行，路上的麻煩，才眞够你受。</p>
<p>洋錢，多圓，多白，亮光一閃心里就會一動的，鈔票，在這里已失去了牠的效能，來往的過客必須的要帶了洋錢定路。</p>
<p>方桌子的四周，圍滿了人，有的嘴里，禁不住的流着口水，老黃同張劉兩個佚頭計算着：「每人半斤猪肉，共有七十五名伕子合計應用肉三十七斤半，每塊現洋能買四斤，大約十塊錢還有我頭。」說着，老黃就挖出了十塊錢放在桌上。空氣立時的緊張起來，在伕子們的眼中，認為半斤是還不足通常的數目，但是他們不敢說，後來仍舊是張伕頭開口了，「請黃大爺再添添吧，他們都是苦人，下次要赶到松坎才能打呢，路上還有四天，抬好點就是。」他說完又笑了，在笑里，含蘊着無限的辛酸味的。</p>
<p>結果，由於我們的說合，老黃又加了五塊錢，也許他們認為滿足了，呼嗎着走去，隨着，在這條長的街上，山歌哼遍了，調子是不同的。隨着，白煮肉的香，酒的香，飯的香，混做了一團，說，笑，猜拳，表現着不能名狀的快慰呵！</p>
<p>菜，擺上了，一碗豆腐花，一盤炒蛋，一聲炒辣角，外加燜肉一碗，這是兩天以來不容易看到的。</p>
<p>老板娘怪時髦的，不停的張羅着。客棧里，沒有什麽廚師傅，都是老板娘自己下手的。眞怪，不知是她做的實在好吃還是「飢不擇食」的緣故，這頓晚飯，給了我們相當的滿意。</p>
<p>十點過後，駐在城里的團丁挨戶的查過了棧，為了第二天的趕路，伕子們安靜的入睡了，一攤一攤的。</p>
<p>夜里，長街是靜的，沒有路燈，黑黝黝地像一條靜臥的蛇子，除掉幾個夜行的掮客外，是少有行人的。躺在床上，聽附近的山風水鳴，是一面手提琴吧？在奏着幽訴的調子呢！</p>
<p>註：打靶——就是犒勞。</p>
<p>上脚——從下頭往上走。</p>
<p>準備錢—由伕頭預先扣除，等到站後再發，作為沒有生意的維持費。</p>

<h3>大學時代（二六）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>有一天晚上，那時新年過後幾個星期了，我在我的住房裏聽見街上有吵鬧聲音。當我把窗戶打開時候，我看見一羣人擁擠過去，其中有幾個戴紅色的學生帽子；最後我在街燈映射之下認出了一個人是我們的校役。</p>
<p>「有甚麽事靑，道斯？」我向下喊。</p>
<p>「剛才有人打架，博士先生！」道斯總呌我做「博士先生」，理由祗有我門二人知道。</p>
<p>「呵？又是在跳舞館吧？」</p>
<p>「不在那裏還在甚麼地方呢？」</p>
<p>這個跳舞錧是一個公開的跳舞塲所，學生和工匠兩方面傳統下來的仇憤常常在那裏爆發。這次事情似乎閙得很兇，因爲道斯揑起拳頭用力一揮，暗示了這個意思。</p>
<p>「誰捱打了？」我還問。</p>
<p>老頭子用手遮住嘴角，低聲對我說：「這次倒打得對了，博士先生。」有一個相識正在底下經過，聽見我們談話便喊說：「是『土伯爵』啊！那些工人揍了他一頓。」</p>
<p>這個綽綽呌做「土伯爵」的人，是一個非常荒唐的美少年，他很少在敎室裏聽敎授講書，却常到决鬥塲上去，至於遊戲娛樂的地方，那是風雨無阻有約必至了。他是屬於那一類的人，他們在大學讀書時候頗出了一陣風頭，後來就消滅得無踪無影了。他常把靑年工匠底女友佔奪過來，因此惹得他們恨入骨髓，但却有一部分年紀蛟輕的大學生把他當作畏懼欣羨的對象。他進了好幾個大學，不久就離開了，多半被開除出來，現在也光顧到我們的大學了。起初因為他的學費很可觀，後來因為他的負債更可觀，所以關於他的各種各式的傳說流播得很廣。他帶來的土伯爵銜頭是恰合他的身份的，因為他的行為能使我們述想起從前「拳頭即公理」的時代，而舊式公子少爺拿弱者任意擺佈的脾氣也似乎完全給他承繼下來了。</p>
<p>我不甚認識「土伯爵」，對他本人也沒有甚麽興趣，於是把窗戶關起來，再不想這件事情而上床睡覺了。</p>
<p>第二天下午，運命又使我想起這件事情來。——我剛喝完咖啡，坐在沙發上讀一本討論羅馬法律的書，忽然有人敲我房門。</p>
<p>我的朋友克里斯多夫底壯美恣態，在我喊的「進來」聲中，小心地遲疑地走進房內來。</p>
<p>「你是一個人在這兒麽？」他問。</p>
<p>「你看不是一個人麽，克里斯多夫。」</p>
<p>他沉默了好一會。「我要離開此地，菲力，」他以後說，「今晚就要動身了；到很遠地方去，到萊茵河我的舅父那裏去：他身體多病，需要一個夥計給他處理一切。但我害怕手頭的錢不够到那裏的路費，賣藝求乞走去又不是我的事情。」</p>

<h3>怎樣去觀察一國的人情風俗？</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>我常驚服一班考察家眼光的銳利，他們只消費幾天——有時是幾小時——的工夫，到某地方去兜一個圈子，立刻就明瞭該地方的社會狀况是怎樣，人民生活又是怎樣。他們不但明瞭，而且確信自己所明瞭的種種，是不會有絲毫錯誤的。其實呢，這些考察家所親眼目見的，眞是有限得很，也許是某一地方某一角落的社會狀態，或某一部分的人民生活的浮面面已。</p>
<p>近日從日本來了一位德國哲學家博士胡爾斯曼氏，他今番出來游歷遠東，所取的態度，的確與衆不同。他由橫濱到上海，坐的是三等艙。據他自己說，他之所以坐三等艙，不是全爲省錢起見，他尙有比省錢更大的目的。卽要知一國的人情風俗，非能就其領袖的舉動看得出，必須由普通人民去觀察，故當與之共處，與之工作，而後始能得到眞相。這就是他所以要雜於羣衆中而旅行的原因了。聽說他這次曾由神戶步行至橫濱，和普通人民相處，入夜隨地寄宿，其費用皆以苦力生活所必需的爲限。又抵日本以前，他亦曾經過印度南華，其日食亦和苦力所需的相同。蓋他深信飲食問題，關係於人民生活，十分重要。非親自嘗試之，實無從知其甘苦。</p>
<p>這位德國胡爾斯曼氏，眞不愧是一個哲學家。他爲要認識一國的人情風俗，自願坐三等艙，去體騐普通人民的苦生活，這是一般考察家所辦不到的。我們很相信，他這回出來遊歷的結果，一定可以獲得許多別人所不能獲得的東西，收拾去做他的遊記的材料。</p>
<p>記得前不久，吳稚暉先生曾到四川遊歷了好些時。他的旅行也是很別緻的，自己一個人，帶一件簡單的包袱，日食則荳腐漿，宿則小客店，東跑西馳，這裏那裏和販夫走卒接觸，仔細探索民間的人情風俗。當時有人問他爲什麼要這樣？他很爽快答說，我若不這樣，到處只和一些大官小吏應酬，日後回去，要是有人問我，四川的米價幾個錢一斗，黃包車拉一里路要多少車資，教我將怎麼回答呢？</p>
<p>像這樣的人，才算得起是一位眞正的考察家。</p>
<h3>妒</h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>所長的辦公室中，一切都靜默着，只有書記宜在寫字臺上抄錄文件發出來的索索索地聲音在嚮。</p>
<p>所長這時，好像平時在沉思着如何籌劃經濟的情形似的沉默，他斜躺在沙法椅上吸着雪茄，手是不停地摸着那兩撮架在嘴唇上的稀疏的鬍子，兩隻像老鼠般的又黑又小的眼睛，在金絲邊的眼鏡裏發着光的閃動，臉孔上雖沒有一點表情的呆滯，但隱隱地却流露出一陣陣漲紅的顏色，那是生氣的火在燃燒着，從心底裏一直的漲到面孔上來。</p>
<p>他躺在沙法上足足有一小時的時間，終於很不安的站起來，他開始在房子裏左旋右轉地踱着方步，很侷促似地兩隻手忽放進褲袋裏，忽交又在背後，忽又摸着鬍子或下巴，他的手幾乎是沒有一刻地安寗。臉孔更是愈來愈漲紅而且變成了紫色或靑色。突然地，他把那半條巳經熄滅了的雪茄，從嘴角拿下來，用力的擲在地板上，雪茄與地板接吻的「柏」的一聲音嚮，却把書記官驚動着的轉過頭來，他那畏縮的眼睛向着所長的臉上一瞟之後，又埋下頭去做着他的工作了。</p>
<p>「我應該怎樣措置那傢伙？」這一個念頭，從昨天晚上到現在一直的在也的腦裏旋繞着，尤其是今天早上從蘭妹家裏回來之後，他更加的感到那傢伙的可惡，恨不得馬上想出一個最滿意的措置的辦法：然而經過十幾固鐘頭的思慮，辦法却依然未有想得出，整個的心，都給這問題苦惱着。</p>
<p>「他不過是一個警長，我是有措置他的一切的權力的，把他免職吧！把他叫來痛駡一頓吧！不，甚至把他殺掉吧！」一切的措置的辦法在他的心裏蠢動，一個消滅又浮現一個新的，但是，這些都不是好的辦法。他又想：「不，我把她趕快的要來，把她藏進我的新屋中，他還有什麼辦法呢？」不，他又認爲這個想念是不應該，假如是這樣，那不是措置他，而是顯出自己的懦弱，而且是會給他嘲笑的。總之，他怎樣的想，結果還是沒有想出辦法來。</p>
<p>午後的陽光，從窗外射進窗裏來，辦公室中到處的顯出明亮，他已經踱得厭倦了，看看時間已是快過完了一個下午，他又復躺下沙法去。</p>
<p>「媽的，我總得措置他一下。」</p>
<p>他不自覺的叫起來，眼睛死釘着窗外。這時書記官已做完了他的每日應做的工作，他眼睛不住的望着所長，使他感到驚異的是所長今天到底爲了什麼事而生氣？他想：「不會對我有什麼脾氣要發作吧！」終於書記官忍耐不住的低心下氣的說：</p>
<p>「所長；今天很不舒服吧，我想還是到市外去玩玩吧！」</p>
<p>書記官一面說着一面做出很安靜的笑臉，他那久已得到所長的稱讚的有觀察力和判斷力的眼睛在所長的臉上左右的流轉着。然而他的話，在所長却好似是一點也沒聽見的依舊沉默着，看也不看一下。這使書記官感到了失敗的悲哀，但他不會就這樣的也跟着沉默起來，他自己知道，所長不論那一次有難於解决的事，都會和他談起而且是給他解决了。他有這樣的自信，並且也知道所長是時時說他很能幹的，所以，他再鼓起了嘴作着第二次的嘗試，他笑着說；</p>
<p>「所長；不大舒服的話，還是到蘭姑娘那裏去走一走吧！」</p>
<h3>最誠實的商人</h3>
<p>— 阿敏作</p>
<p>臭豆腐肉干！……</p>
<h3>元康布莊</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>吳平律師代表元康布莊淸理通告</p>
<p>茲據當事人元康布莊經理何永衡君，來所聲稱：因市面不佳，營業淸淡，以致週轉不靈無法維持，今不得已，祇得委託貴律師代表淸理賬目，……合亟代爲聲明如上。所有元康各債權人請儘於三日內來所登記，各債務人亦希於一星期內將所該欵項送交來所……</p>
<p>有一天新豐街上那爿素稱營業發達信用堅固的元康布莊，到了九點鐘敲過</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>还没有開門，排門前却圍着一大堆人，像在讀什麼吿示似的唸着。</p>
<p>自從元康貼出了這張淸理通吿以後，便引起了許多人的懷疑，猜想，議論；大家對這元康布莊的倒閉，彷彿戚到了一個意外的突變。</p>
<p>在幾天以前，經理何永衡每天總是眉頭打了一個苦結，東奔西走的設法，要想把這爿在風雨飄搖中的元康布莊多維持些時侯；但是在他竭力設法的結果，依然毫無辦法！然而所打出的支票，却都要到期快了。各處的門路全已斷絕，銀記名下的一千元存項，到月底又說要來提取，店中貨物已空，上行往來是早斷了，開了門沒有貨物賣，那還成個什麽店……他這幾天給這些問題煎熬得坐立不安起來；可是這爿雖然是合夥的店，而股東却誰也肯負責的，卽楚那位在店中恊理兼總賬房的王月淸，他也是股東一份子，但是他什麽斤量都不會擔負，只知吃飯做事拿薪水，同普通夥友一樣。</p>
<p>何永衡在大毒的日頭下奔走了一天，看了不少怪臉，聽了無數鬼叫，終於失望地回到了自己房裏，猛的向床上一躺，眼珠子瞪着天花板；憤怒和怨恨儘在腦子裏交織着：</p>
<p>「好，利益是大家享受，責任却全向我一個人身上一推」！他想到前天股東緊急談話會上的情形，實在太使人生氣了。</p>
<p>「今天召諸位來談話，是因爲元康自從受了市面不景氣的影響，所以營業就一天一天的儘管淸淡下去，而店裏的銀根也一天一天的週轉不靈，上行的往來又被拒絕，貨物均須現批。可是目前店裏的經濟支絀已達到了山窮水盡的地步，所有銀記戶下的一千元存項又要提取，還有房租及賬項打出的支票也有約近千元。—」他說到這裏頓了一頓又接下去說：「這半年以來的苦力掙扎，我已經精疲力竭；但是現在我向各處張羅設法都沒有辦法，所以如今我委實是力不勝逮了。而這緊急的危局尤其無法應付，現在希望諸位同舟共濟，像個辦法出來，保全了這爿店；只要這月底就可以敷衍過去，過了這夏天，等到入秋營業或許會起色些；不然，我只能對諸位不起宣告清理了。」他將店中情形和自已的意見報吿完了，接着用一種痛苦而希冀的目光向他們每一個人的臉上掃瞥了一轉；但見他們你望着我，我望着你，沒有表情也沒有意見，更沒有答復。</p>
<p>「請問諸位還是要維持下去呢？還是爽快淸理？倘若要維持下去的話，大家再掏一點腰包。否則祇有淸理！」何永衡等到燃去了半支捲烟，還不見他們有動靜，於是又站了起來向他們發問，但是坐了下去又站起來補充了這樣一句：「諸位有意見請儘量發表，有可以接受的我當接受。」</p>
<p>「何先生，兄弟有句不大中聽的話；你旣然身爲經理，責任所在自應設法維持，我們股東已經拿出股欵，自然要想享受應得的利益，但央無出兩次股欵之理！」坐在何永衡右側，鼻架眼鏡的那個中年胖子也正在發表他的意見，但是話還沒有完，何永衡却接上去說：</p>
<p>「金仁兄，你的話錯了，我雖身爲經理，這是承你們諸位的推重，可沒有包賺錢的責任，要知道這是市面關係，並不是我曠廢職務和自挪用空的……」</p>
<p>沒有結果的會沒有結果的散了，他終於沒有辦法，正式宣吿了淸理，在六月三十日的那天，元康布莊就沒有開門，而徘門上却發現了一張律師代表淸理的通吿。</p>
<h3>夏日小品</h3>
<p>— 安遷</p>
<p>一，布穀烏</p>
<p>撒灰，車水，十日八日接速慇懃的照顧，忠實的看護，碧綠的秧針一天長似一天，農民站在旁邊，微笑了。</p>
<p>布穀鳥還是不分畫夜在頭頂上聲聲催喚，不偷懶，似乎也不覺得疲倦。我心裏想說：</p>
<p>——怱忙的鳥兒呀，請休息休息罷！卽使你不催，種田人關係自身的工作，自身的糧食，這田地也楚不肯荒廢的啊。你看他們日出而作，日入而息，多麽辛勤！</p>
<p>靑蛙「閣閣閣」，會集在秧田裏，合唱着希望的歌。</p>
<p>撒好灰，車完水，農民站在旁邊，對着一天長似一天的碧綠的秧針，微笑了。這時候，過去的悲苦：捐，租，稅，債，利息一個個上門來的凶惡的臉相！現在的哀愁：桑葉賤，養蠶賠本，繭子不值錢，半飢半飽的苦惱的日子。—這些，在別的時候，他們準會想到，並且憂慮；然而現在，在微笑中，在秧針的旁邊，却沒有一絲陰影籠罩在他們的心裏或掠過他們的腦際，他們是把整個的希望安放在未來，收穫上去了。</p>
<p>然而未來呢？水災，旱災，蟲災，還要經過無數次堅忍的苦鬥，然後才能從汗血所寄的田裏收到些穀；收到之後，卽使還了租有餘多，却又會碰到兩塊六角一擔，不值錢，依舊不够上利息，沒有好日子過！</p>
<p>然而現在他們不想，他們微笑，他們在希望——</p>
<p>布糓鳥還楚忙忙碌碌地催喚着。</p>
<p>二，傍晚</p>
<p>夏的原野是旣生動而又深沉，並且也非常寗靜。</p>
<p>西方佈滿了彩色的雲霞，咖啡色，玫瑰色，檸檬色的，相互併吞，相互追逐，破有些鬧意。夕陽，已失却了威嚴的光輝，僅只剩半個殘觖的血盆延擱在還山的項巔。炊烟，一縷縷，昇騰起來，和暮靄交織成夜底前衛；潮河頭嗚嗚鳴，小火輸，在發出滿載歸來的歡欣的長嘯。</p>
<p>從靜靜的原野望出去：麥桿，靑葱；秧針，碧綠；樹，像是（柄柄巨大的傘，看上去非常肥碩而飽滿。整個的田間顯得很有含蓄，使人想像到那關外千山萬里相昆連的秋季的靑紗帳來。——不錯，靑紗帳是我們弱者的烟幕彈。</p>
<p>牧童，騎在牛背上，嘴裏躺着山歌，在慢慢地走回家去。婦女們都提了蒲包，隱身在桑樹田裏採晚蠶吃的桑葉。農夫們有的挑了糞桶，有的掮了鋤頭，有的背了一草籃萵苣葉想背回家去給豬吃。總之，田間的人是都能勤懇地工作着的。</p>
<p>農村，表面上很平靜，也很繁榮，然而這是自然與人類的問隔，實際上，農民的生活是悲慘到無以復加了！</p>

<h3>Han Dike Defense Crisis Slightly Reduced; Zhang Gong Dike and Other Dangerous Works Have Been Blocked; Future Flood Control Administration Slightly Changed; Jianghan Engineering Bureau Takes Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The upstream water level has now receded slightly. Today's Hankou water level is 50 feet 9 inches, a decrease of 4.5 inches compared to the highest water level of 51 feet 3.5 inches on the 14th of this month. The water level outside Zhang Gong Dike today is 54 feet 2 inches, a decrease of 1 foot 9 inches compared to the highest water level of 56 feet 1 inch on the 13th of this month. The Wuhan dike defense crisis has slightly reduced. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Ye Peng resigns as flood control supervisor. The Jianghan Bureau takes full responsibility for Zhang Dike. A second line of defense is built along the Pinghan Railway. Wuchang also builds a second line of defense along the city, under the unified command of Liu Shoupeng. Zhang Qun told reporters that the Wuhan dike is gradually stabilizing. 100,000 yuan has been issued and 300,000 yuan borrowed for emergency relief in the 33 disaster-stricken counties. Yang Si claims illness and has requested a thorough investigation by the Economic Commission. He will also request the central government to implement the river dredging plan. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun told reporters from this newspaper: 1. More than ten leaks in the Wujin Dike in Wuchang have been blocked, and the Wuhui Dike is expected to be preserved. 2. Zhang Gong Dike has been inspected and rescued by Ye Peng. Collapses and leaks have been repaired separately. The degree of danger has been slightly reduced. For the sake of complete safety, the Pinghan Railway dike is still being raised as a second line of defense, costing about 100,000 yuan. 3. The disaster in Hubei has reached 33 counties. 100,000 yuan has been allocated for emergency relief, and no disaster relief bonds will be issued. 4. Loans from banks are in progress. 5. The fundamental solution for flood prevention lies in dredging the Jiang and Xiang rivers. He has suggested this to the central government, and the water conservancy authorities also have plans. He will again ask the central government to promote its realization, ensuring lasting peace. 6. Yang Silian's illness is unknown. The Economic Commission has been telegraphed to conduct a thorough investigation. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Huang Wenzhi telegraphed from Shanghai, reporting his meeting with Song Kong to discuss relief for Hubei's financial and flood disasters. A solution has been determined. Kong has telegraphed the Hankou Bank Association to accept goods as collateral for 2 million yuan, first to maintain the market. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Party, government, military, and business held an emergency meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on the 16th. Wu Guozhen reported the dangerous situation of Zhang Dike. It was decided to use the dike as the first line of defense, and to build a second line of defense based on the Pinghan Railway, with 700,000 sandbags purchased by the Chamber of Commerce. Workers will be mobilized by the Party headquarters. If necessary, all factories will be closed for a few days to mobilize workers for defense. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Under the military command of Ye Peng, the danger of Zhang Gong Dike has been slightly reduced. 4,000 people have been mobilized in Wuchang for emergency repairs. Volunteers, including many women, have automatically participated in the work at Saihu Dike and Wuqing Gate. Currently, there are more than 200,000 flood victims in Wuhan and Hanyang. The Disaster Relief Association has purchased 4,000 shi of rice and 10,000 bags of flour to relieve the disaster victims. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) More than ten places in Zhang Dike, such as Gushaoshu and Fenjinlu Jinkou, have collapsed and leaked in the past two days. Although the water is continuing to recede, the wind direction is unfavorable, and the entire dike remains dangerous. Under Ye Peng's military command, today a police officer, Li Cheng, was sentenced to death for neglecting his duty and delaying the opportunity for inspection. A notice was also issued stating that any personnel ordered to prevent flooding, regardless of their affiliation, will be subject to military law if any negligence or delay is found. All employees on the dike are trembling with fear, and the work is extremely tense. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) On the 17th, the Xiang River receded another foot or so, but it is still more than three feet higher than the Yangtze River. Regarding the plan for engineers to blow up the Chenjiaji railway tracks to divert river water into the Yangtze River, it is still under consideration due to concerns that construction may harm nearby areas too much. If the situation gradually recedes, it may be terminated. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The dangerous works at Zhang Gong Dike, Gushaoshu, Jinkou, etc., have been completely blocked by Ye Peng's supervision of tens of thousands of soldiers and workers day and night on the 17th. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau convened a city flood control meeting the night before, and there have been slight changes to the flood control administration. The police department, municipal government, public security bureau, and other responsible agencies, because the dangerous works of Zhang Gong Dike have been rescued and the water has also receded slightly, transferred the flood control responsibility to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau from yesterday, with all military and political leaders still assisting at any time. Ye Peng has worked hard day and night to supervise strictly, so that Zhang Gong Dike, which has been repeatedly on the verge of danger, can be spared from collapsing. However, Ye has not been able to sleep peacefully for several days and nights, and is extremely tired, resulting in the recurrence of his old illness and extreme pain. On the 17th, he still went to Zhang Gong Dike to inspect several times. Mayor Wu and Director Chen are preparing to fully supervise the workers to raise the railway dike (from Qiaokou to Zhuakou) as the city's second flood control line, fearing that they will not be able to be stationed on the dike all the time. As for Jin Jutang of the police department and Shen Chengyan, the brigade commander of the police brigade, because new cracks were found at Jinkou again on the 17th, and the situation has not completely escaped danger, they are still stationed on the dike to supervise the soldiers and workers to work hard to rescue and protect. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters held a regular meeting at 8:00 a.m. on the 16th. Regarding the Jianghan Engineering Bureau Chief Yang Silian's claim of illness and resignation, it was generally believed that the bureau chief was solely responsible during this period of serious flood, and should work hard in spite of his illness. It was heard that a resolution was made to submit it to the central government and the executive headquarters, instructing the bureau chief to take active responsibility to reassure the people. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level here was 51 feet 15 last morning, and this morning it dropped to 50 feet 9. People here are greatly relieved to see the water receding. At the same time, the authorities are now building the railway embankment to a height of 53 feet, fearing that if Zhang Gong Dike collapses, the railway embankment can be relied upon to protect Hankou. The situation is gradually improving, but optimism is not yet permitted, because Zhang Gong Dike is still under great pressure from the river water. There are about 48,000 flood victims in Wuchang and Hanyang who have nowhere to return. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water has receded today, and the situation is slightly relaxed, but the authorities are still vigilant. Workers are working along the dike as usual. Although the Pinghan train is interrupted, a foreign woman arrived here from Jigong Mountain today. She traveled by train and sampan, taking a total of 26 hours to reach her destination. Relief work is now underway. Zhang Xueliang has now begun fundraising to supplement relief funds. It is thought that the embankments of the Han River have all collapsed. According to Chinese sources, the worst-hit area is Tianmen, where thousands of people have drowned. However, local officials reported that only a few bodies were retrieved from the river. Hundreds of women and children were rescued from rooftops. Whether Zhang Gong Dike can last for a long time is uncertain, but the future seems more optimistic. Zhang Xueliang's private plane soared in the sky this afternoon, and the public believes that he must be carrying food to relieve the hunger of the disaster victims in the disaster area. According to the driver of the China National Aviation Corporation, who arrived here today, the situation in Yichang and Shashi was normal yesterday, but Shashi was slightly flooded on the 10th due to the sudden rise of the river. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Economic Commission and Water Conservancy Association Discuss Various Flood Control Plans; All Proposals Regarding Fundamental Jiang and River Facilities Have Been Fully Discussed and Will Be Published Separately After Sorting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission's Water Conservancy Conference continued to hold a regular meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th. More than 20 people attended, including Kong Xiangxi, Chen Guofu, Fu Rulin, Kong Xiangrong, and Qin Fen. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 p.m. Resolution proposals have been made on the fundamental facilities and preliminary engineering plans for the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Grand Canal, and Wei River. They are being sorted out and will be published within days. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The second meeting of the Economic Council's Water Conservancy Committee was held at Shen time on the 17th. Attendees included Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Honglie, Qin Fen, Chen Guofu, Kong Xiangrong, Ding Wenjiang, Shen Shuyu, Zeng Rongpu, Zhu Guangcai, Han Guojun, Li Yizhi, Fu Rulin, Qian Changzhao, and Mao Yisheng. All 30 of the proposals were fully discussed. Some of the proposals decided on fundamental governance, while others decided on partial solutions. The principles were handed over to the various water conservancy committees for handling. The cases discussed today included various water conservancy projects such as the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Huai River, Grand Canal, Wei River, and Ruyin River. The proposals will be sorted out and published separately on the 18th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Guofu returned to Zhenjiang on the night of the 17th after attending the Water Conservancy Conference to preside over the flood control meeting on the 18th. Mao Yisheng, Sun Fushi, and others went to the meeting on the morning of the 18th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, came to Beijing to attend the Water Conservancy Conference and is scheduled to return to Jinan on the evening of the 18th. According to him, the levee between Dongzhuang and Linpuji on the Yellow River has breached five times in a row, and the water flow is huge. When the breaches first occurred, the river water flow was 13,000 cubic meters per second (that is, the water flow rate per second). 70% of the total amount was diverted southward from the breaches. Although the water flow has receded, there are still 2,000 cubic meters per second flowing down, spreading across the plain, 70 li wide. Good fields and houses have been submerged, and hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and gathered on the embankment, eating and sleeping in the open air. The current has reached Juye and is expected to reach Weishan Lake in Su territory within a week. The flood season is approaching, and the river water will flow out more dramatically. If it cannot be blocked within the month, the disaster in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu will be irreparable. Tens of thousands of people around Weishan Lake are building dikes to prevent the lake from overflowing after the water arrives. However, the capacity of the lake is very small, the water is coming in unlimited quantities, and the downstream is inevitably overflowing. Even if the water is diverted to the Grand Canal, the river scene can only accommodate 400 cubic meters per second, and there are still 1,600 cubic meters per second that cannot be discharged. The current plan is that blocking the breaches, if they can be joined, can alleviate the situation for a while. Apart from attending the Water Conference, I came here to present two points to the central government on behalf of Chairman Han: (1) Please allocate huge sums to block the breaches and seek fundamental river management methods. Although Shandong's strength is limited, it will do its best. (2) Please allocate relief funds to help the disaster victims. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianmen Suffers the Most Severe Flood Disaster; Rumors of 100,000 People Drowned</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Tianmen is the worst hit by the Hubei disaster. It is rumored that 100,000 people have drowned. More than 14,000 bodies have been recovered from Zhangjie Port near Yuekou in recent days. The water in Mianyang and Hanchuan has not yet receded. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Counties in the Upper Reaches of the Xiang River Have All Become Unprecedentedly Huge Disasters</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The counties in the upper reaches of the Xiang River have all become unprecedentedly severe disasters. Countless people have drowned. In recent days, large numbers of floating corpses have been flowing down the river, some with entire families tied together with ropes, and many livestock corpses. It is impossible to completely retrieve and bury them. Straw huts, wooden furniture, etc. are all over the river. The situation is extremely tragic. Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, instructing them to block the collapsed dike breaches along the river after the Xiang River recedes slightly, and to complete the project within a time limit. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Flows into Weishan Lake; Another Breach in the Old Official Dike in Lijin; Water Enters Juye City; Wenning Submerged; Jining County Mobilizes All Civilians to Build Dikes</h3>
<p>Shao Hanyuan Inspects Peibei; Jiangsu Province Technicians Go to Shandong to Survey the Water Situation</p>
<p>(Jinan) After the Yellow River breach water entered Nanyang Lake, the lake water flowed back and all the rivers rose, and the situation became serious again. Jining County mobilized all civilians to build dikes, the water entered Juye City, and Wenshang and Ningyang were submerged again. The provincial government sent one person to each of the six counties of Heze, Jiaxiang, Juye, Juancheng, Yuncheng, and Dongping with 10,000 yuan for emergency relief. Han ordered the Juye disaster victims to flee to Jining and Yanzhou, and the Yuncheng disaster victims to flee to Tai'an. The respective county chiefs were instructed to find temples and build straw sheds for them to live in, and to find them jobs and teach the children to read. More than 700 villages have been submerged in Juye, and many women, children, and the elderly have drowned. Corpses are often seen in the river east of the city. The disaster is unprecedented in nearly a century.</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Han Fuju set out to inspect the Yellow River breach. He had already gotten into the car, but a heavy rain suddenly fell, and he was unable to go. Han said that he would go as soon as the road was passable. After a severe drought this year, the province has suffered this flood disaster. There is no money to block the breaches and provide disaster relief. It is necessary to ask the central government to allocate funds quickly, otherwise the disaster victims will have no food or shelter and will have to live in public places. Because the people are the masters and the civil servants are the servants, we must not sit idly by while the masters are suffering. He has telegraphed key figures in the central government again, making an earnest appeal. The current disaster area extends from Juancheng through Heze, Yuncheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Jining, Dongping, Wenshang, Ningyang, and Shou Zhang for more than ten counties, 300 li long and 80 li wide. More than 2 million disaster victims. If it floods further south, Jinxiang, Yutai, Chengwu, and Dingtao will also be difficult to escape. Li Yizhi telegraphed Han, saying that the Jin Dike will be inspected and accepted on the 20th. Liu Zhi has sent Zhang Jingyu as a representative. Li is scheduled to come to Jinan from Beijing with Zhang Honglie on the 19th. Please ask Han to send Zhang as a representative to go to the inspection and acceptance. Today, Luokou rose by 5 cm, and the water level was 28.91 meters. At the Yellow River People's Dike at the junction of Puyang County and Puyang County, Puyang refused to cooperate in emergency repairs. The provincial government has telegraphed the Hebei provincial government, asking them to order the county to cooperate. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Another breach occurred in the old official dike downstream of the Yellow River in Lijin, 5 zhang wide and 1 zhang deep. The water is rushing towards the old course of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(Jinan) Fang Juehui came from the north today and went to Yanzhou to transfer to Jining to inspect the flood disaster. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Zhou Yushan, a technician from the Jiangsu Construction Department, and Zhao Yusu, a technician from the Huai River Guidance Association, passed through Xuzhou to Shandong today to survey the water situation. After Zhou Zhao met with Han in Jinan, they went to western Shandong for inspection, and also visited the new dikes in eastern Henan. Commissioner Wang of the Huai River District telegraphed Xu, saying that he had stepped up flood prevention and asked the Construction Department to rush to build the Pibei Canal Gate to prevent the Yellow River water from seizing the canal. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) On the 16th, the Special Commissioner's Office received a telegram from Tian Suixiang, a water inspector specially dispatched from Jining, stating that the Yellow River water had flooded into Nanyang Lake. The counties in Shandong are currently busy with rescue work and have little flood prevention work. Investigation showed that Nanyang Lake is connected to Weishan Lake. If a large amount of water is poured into Weishan Lake, northern Jiangsu is very worrying. Now the Construction Department has added technician Yu Shufang to Xuzhou to assist in flood prevention work. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan arrived in Pei yesterday and went to the banks of Weishan Lake in Peibei for inspection. This afternoon, he summoned the county chiefs of Pei and Feng to discuss conscription and decided to mobilize all on the 18th to start building dikes. After the Yellow River water entered Nanyang Lake, it is now pouring into Weishan Lake. Because the water is still slow and the reeds in the lake are blocking the flow, Weishan Lake has not risen much. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Relief Association is scheduled to meet on the morning of the 18th to discuss flood prevention measures. Xu Xinkang, Director of the Canal Engineering Bureau, and Ge Hanlou, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Project, will both attend the meeting to report. The Canal Engineering Bureau has appointed Ge as the commissioner for supervising the repair of the Pisu Sihua embankment. The four counties of Huaisi Sushu telegraphed the province, ordering the district chiefs along the six Tang rivers in the Central Canal to quickly raise the dikes. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huaiyin: The Huaiyin County Government convened a Yellow River flood prevention meeting and immediately presented two opinions to the provincial government, led by water conservancy expert Wang Shuxiang: (1) Please send a senior official to Shandong to investigate and report on the water situation, and assist the people of Shandong in repairing and blocking the breaches to fundamentally eliminate the flood disaster, imitating the actions of the 14th year of the Republic of China. (2) If the Yellow River water seizes the flow and enters Jiangsu, please divert it into the old Yellow Sea. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water in western Shandong has entered the Niutou River in Peibei and converged into Weishan Lake. In recent days, the lake water has risen sharply. The people of Tongshan and Pei County are extremely worried. Shao Hanyuan, the special commissioner of the Tongshan district, personally went to Pei to supervise the civilian laborers in the counties to pick up and build the Jiangsu Dike to prevent the Yellow River. The two county chiefs of Tongpei, Wang Gongyu and Su Min, were both on the lake, personally collecting civilian laborers. Construction began on the 17th. The people were shaken by the Yellow River disaster, so they enthusiastically went to work, and they never slackened even under the fiery sun. The current dike body is 160 li long, and it is planned to be 1 zhang 8 chi high and 6 chi wide at the top. It is scheduled to be built in two weeks. This dike can serve as a barrier for northern Jiangsu. The officials and people of Tongpei are doing their best. The main flow of the Yellow River has now tended towards Weishan Lake, with a tendency to seize the Huai River and enter the sea. The entire Huai River guidance project is based on the Weishan Lake Dike, so the province and the entire Xuhuai people are all worried. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level of Weishan Lake in northern Xuzhou continued to rise. The water level on the 16th and 17th was about 3 or 4 chi higher. In order to prevent the Yellow River water from flowing into Xuzhou, the Xubu authorities decided to repair the old Yellow River Dike in northern Xuzhou and fill in all the breaches within three days.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Factory Safety and Public Safety</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>Factories have many sharp instruments. And their driving force is either water, fire, or electricity. Flying wheels spin, and engines rumble. A slight carelessness can easily lead to disaster. It is common to hear of workers losing arms, breaking necks, or dying violently. If the disaster expands, the damage may extend to people outside the workers and houses outside the factory buildings. For example, the accident at a certain malt extract factory in the past injured people on the road. This year, the careless handling of the celluloid factory extended to many neighboring houses, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. All these unexpected disasters are extremely pitiful. Here, we cannot help but think of the infinite importance of factory safety equipment. This is certainly not something that can be fully achieved with just "No Smoking" signs and a few "fire buckets."</p>
<p>The factory is where the business owner's property is located, and it is also where the workers entrust their lives. Both labor and management certainly do not want accidents to happen in the factory. However, disasters still occur, mainly due to several reasons. (1) A moment of carelessness leads to a major disaster. (2) Greedy for small profits and forgetting about major harms. (3) Equipment is too simple. Therefore, for the sake of the factory, instead of having inadequate equipment and the risk of property loss everywhere, it is better to prevent problems before they happen and not begrudge small expenses now to seek better safety equipment. As for the sake of the workers, careless work can easily lead to danger. The worst case is death, and the least case is disability. It may even harm others and implicate the factory. It is better to be cautious at all times and in all places to avoid unexpected disasters. The factory should always be vigilant. Workers who are not yet skilled should not be allowed to take on important work. The level of fatigue of workers should also be adjusted to avoid carelessness due to lack of energy. All of these are for the safety of both the factory and the workers.</p>
<p>As for the public suffering damage from the factory's carelessness, the reason why this is often heard is that it is difficult to expect immediate improvements in today's factories due to practical reasons. For the sake of punishing the past and preventing the future, the inspection of factories should be given correct guidance at any time and ordered to improve. All materials containing explosive or easily explosive materials, and their workplaces, should also have equipment to prevent danger. The storage location of materials must be strong with walls and roofs, or even built in a basement for storage. For factories that have already been established and are not easy to improve immediately, their storage of materials can be restricted and the minimum fire-fighting equipment can be stipulated to prevent any unforeseen events. Furthermore, the location of the factory, the sound of the machines, is enough to disturb the peace of the public, and the flying dust and the spread of turbid air are also harmful to the public's health. Therefore, all major industrial cities should delineate industrial areas. All factories should find land in the industrial area to establish themselves. Those in non-industrial areas should also build in the industrial area if they build new factory buildings in the future. If so, the authorities can easily supervise and inspect the factory and the facilities it should have. If there are factories that are prone to danger in prosperous and bustling cities, they should be warned and restricted in advance to avoid ordering changes after they are established, which would lead to greater losses. The above is based on a consideration of factory interests and public safety. I have expressed my humble opinions. I sincerely hope that industrialists will take appropriate measures on the issue of factory safety to prevent the recurrence of factory tragedies.</p>
<h3>New Soviet Aviation Plan: Trial Non-stop Arctic Flight between Moscow and San Francisco</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Japanese newspapers here report that Moscow news says that the Russian government authorities have a new aviation plan, that is, to fly directly from Moscow to San Francisco via the Arctic Ocean, a long-distance non-stop flight of more than 5,000 kilometers. If this plan is successful, it will open a new era in the aviation industry and is extremely worthy of world attention. (17th Hualian Electric)</p>
<p>(Moscow) If the climate is suitable, the Northern Sea Route Administration will organize a non-stop flight from Moscow to San Francisco via the Arctic. The current route is from Moscow via Arctic Pengqi Island to Simpson Fortress, then across Wankov City, along the coast to San Francisco. This flight will use a single-engine aircraft, with Soviet hero Levanevsky as the first pilot, Bedokov as the second pilot, and Levchenkov as the navigator. For this flight, the Foreign Affairs Committee asked the British government to allow it to pass through Canadian territory, and asked the U.S. government to allow it to pass through U.S. territory and land in San Francisco. The U.S. government has already expressed its consent to this, and the British government's reply will be received soon. (17th Tass Electric)</p>
<h3>Hess Suffers Minor Injury in Skating; Rumors of Critical Illness Are Groundless</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The previous rumors that Hess, a cabinet member of the Department of Inaction, was critically ill seem to be groundless. Hess only injured his shoulder in a skating fall and is now being treated at the Hohenlychen Village Hospital. Hess also attended the reception when representatives of the British Veterans of War came to Berlin recently. (16th Havas Electric)</p>
<h3>Peaceful Resolution of Italian-Ethiopian Dispute; Britain and France Negotiate a New Plan; Finding a Way Out of Difficulties Is Nothing More Than Supporting the Strong and Suppressing the Weak; Italian Actions Are Active, I'm Afraid There Will Be Little Effect</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news from diplomatic circles here, Britain and France have reached a solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, that is, to find a way out of difficulties. On the one hand, Italy can be satisfied, and on the other hand, the dignity of the League of Nations can be taken into account. The responsibility for reconciliation is completely shirked to Ethiopia. Italy will submit a proposal to the next meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council to impeach Ethiopia, accusing Ethiopia of failing to abolish slavery and fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations. If Ethiopia tacitly acknowledges its faults, Italy can obtain the right to administer part of Ethiopia on its behalf. If Ethiopia refuses this accusation, Italy may formally request the League of Nations to revoke Ethiopia's membership and automatically take responsibility for maintaining order and peace in Ethiopia. The plan is the final draft for a peaceful resolution of the dispute, but it is believed here that it may not have any effect. Recent news from Addis Ababa claims that the Ethiopian king is determined to reject any suggestions that harm Ethiopia's sovereignty, and Italy is actively carrying out military actions, and war seems inevitable.

<h3>League of Nations Executive Council to Meet in Early Next Month; Avenol Visits French Foreign Minister; Eden Departs for Geneva</h3>
<p>(Paris) After arriving here from London, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with Ethiopian Ambassador to France Haharia De today, and tomorrow he will meet with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. According to well-informed sources, the League of Nations Executive Council will convene a meeting in early next month to discuss the situation in Ethiopia. (16th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>(London) Minister of Inaction Eden set out for Geneva today to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Thursday to consider the Italian-Ethiopian issue. Eden's actions this time are actually an indirect expression of Britain's assistance to Italy, because at this Executive Council meeting, Britain and France may allow Italy to denounce Ethiopia's illegal continuation of the slave system and its unworthiness to be a member of the League of Nations. If Britain and France adopt this attitude in the Executive Council, then Italy's war against Ethiopia will be no less than a legitimate action. (17th National News Agency Electric)</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Minister Visits Rome; Consultations with the Blackshirt Minister</h3>
<p>Vienna: According to newspapers here, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has now set out for Italy to consult with Mussolini. Litvinov's trip has aroused speculation among the general public. Litvinov is the chairman of this year's League of Nations Executive Council. According to the plan proposed by Litvinov in May, he intends to include the Addis Ababa issue on the agenda of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on August 25, which will have a major impact on the Italian-Ethiopian issue. Furthermore, Litvinov's trip may be due to the recent visit of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to Britain and France to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian issue in detail, so he intends to take this opportunity to inquire about Mussolini's entire opinion on this issue. In addition, Litvinov will also explore Mussolini's attitude towards the Soviet-Romanian military mutual assistance agreement. (17th National Electric)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Continues to Deploy to East Africa; Plans to Use Air Force to Subdue Abyssinians</h3>
<p>Naples: Italian army and navy vessels continue to depart for North Africa in an endless stream. The aircraft carrier "Miraglia," carrying 24 aircraft and 80 aviators, set sail today for Massawa in Eritrea. Two troop transport ships departed for Africa yesterday, and six more are being loaded with troops and will depart soon. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from Rome, 300 bombers will soon depart for Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, commanded by Army Undersecretary General Valle. There are already 100 aircraft in the Italian colonies in Africa. It is rumored that Mussolini plans to quickly subdue Abyssinia with air power. At the start of the war, he will launch a concentrated air attack to intimidate the Abyssinian people. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italian Aviator Sets New East Africa Flight Record; Travels 3,000 Miles in 25 Hours</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian aviator Stoppani flew a seaplane from Monfalcone to Italian Somaliland, traveling 3,087 miles in 25 hours, breaking the long-distance seaplane flight record. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Criticize Third-Party Intervention; Territorial Ambitions Clearly Revealed</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers continue to vehemently criticize foreign governments for attempting to interfere. "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that the proposed solutions from various governments are not only unsuitable for Italy's policy rights and needs, but also incompatible with the nature of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Abyssinian people have repeatedly insulted the Italian flag, which must be punished to satisfaction. Furthermore, Abyssinians frequently encroach upon Italian territory, which can no longer be tolerated. Italy must put an end to such actions to prevent future occurrences. Italy also needs territorial expansion. The proposed solutions from various governments disregard this and other conditions. Past events and the current situation make clear Italy's responsibility to clarify the situation for a lasting solution. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official "Il Giornale d'Italia" published an article stating that Italy will only accept a complete, concrete, and definitive resolution to the Abyssinian problem. Italy's objectives are threefold: (1) Abyssinia must compensate Italy for various disrespectful actions, especially the Walwal incident. "Italy's national prestige is tied to the resolution of the Abyssinian problem, therefore, all external interference will be rejected. The League of Nations can only recognize that Abyssinia does not qualify as an independent nation and should be excluded from the civilized world." (2) Obtain the necessary guarantees to prevent the recurrence of incidents, as a guarantee signed by Abyssinia is insufficient. (3) Pursue the development that Italy needs. Regarding this point, the newspaper explained that Italy could demand changes to Abyssinia's current system but prefers to take on the task of bringing culture to a barbaric nation. It concluded that all civilized nations should support Italy. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>White Russians Offer Services to Italy; Plan to Build a New Country in East Africa</h3>
<p>Belgrade: According to today's newspaper, former anti-Red soldiers who belonged to Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel, etc., during the Russian Revolution have initiated a new movement to establish a new Russia in East Africa to settle the displaced people driven out by the Red Party. Their plan is to serve Italy in the event of war between Italy and Abyssinia. After success, Mussolini would cede a portion of Abyssinian territory for them to establish a new country, under Italian protection. It is said that there are thousands of White Russians who wish to serve Italy. According to their leader, it is not difficult to recruit several expeditionary regiments. The newspaper also stated that whether this proposal is successful depends on Italy's willingness and the attitude of other countries. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy Purchases Cargo Ships from Greece; Exclusively for Transporting Troops</h3>
<p>Athens: According to various newspapers, representatives of Italian shipping companies have arrived here to negotiate the purchase of Greek cargo ships for transporting Italian troops to East Africa. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italy Denies Borrowing from the United States</h3>
<p>(New York) Rumors circulated that Italy was borrowing from Wall Street financiers in this city for the purpose of waging war against Abyssinia. A prominent Italian-American banker in New York spoke to the "New York Times," denying these rumors. He claimed that if Italy wanted to borrow from Europe, it would be easier; why seek afar when it is near? Moreover, the US Senate and House of Representatives passed Senator Johnson's bill last April, stipulating that countries in arrears with war debts are not allowed to borrow in the United States. Italy has not yet paid off its war debts; how could it be an exception? According to this gentleman, who has lived in New York for a long time and closely followed financial issues between the United States and Italy for 20 years, his statement is noteworthy. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain and America Continuously Exchange Views</h3>
<p>(London) Britain and the United States are constantly exchanging views on the Italo-Abyssinian problem. According to the "Daily Mail," British authorities greatly praise Italy's achievements in managing its colonies in Africa. At the same time, it is said that it would be fortunate for Abyssinia to be ruled by Italy. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Sympathetic to Italy; Ambassador Declares No Desire to Intervene</h3>
<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Sugimura called on Prime Minister Mussolini today, offering assurances that Japan has no interests in Abyssinia and therefore has no intention of interfering in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Yesterday, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Sugimura and French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun separately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss matters. Political circles believe that the two ambassadors' visits are an important step for Italy to act freely in Abyssinia. Italy faces three main difficulties in acting freely in Abyssinia: first, Japan's interests in East Africa; second, the procedures stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant; and third, the restrictions Italy adopted towards Britain and France in the 1906 Tripartite Treaty. With Japanese Ambassador Sugimura's formal assurance to the Prime Minister that Japan has no political interests in Abyssinia and therefore will not interfere in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it seems that the first difficulty has disappeared. Recently, when Italian newspapers debated with British newspapers over the Abyssinian problem, they repeatedly compared Italy's actions in Africa with Japan's actions in Asia. Now, the Japanese Ambassador's visit to the Palazzo Venezia can be regarded as a sign of sympathy for Italy. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Greek-Yugoslav Talks Conclude; Continue to Maintain the Balkan Status Quo Based on a Policy of Consultation</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Before leaving the Yugoslav capital to return to his country, Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Army Kondylis told the local "Times," "The policy of Balkan consultation has been determined and cannot be easily changed. We are not hostile to anyone. What we desire is to maintain the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula." He also said, "I believe the monarchists will win the Greek referendum. As for Greece's domestic policy, there will be no change due to the restoration. Even after the restoration, Greece will still be a republic, but with a king on top of it. The Balkan Entente will always be the basis of Greece's foreign policy, and there will be no change in that either." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>To Restore Budget Balance, France Implements Austerity; Government Issues 23 Decrees, Cutting Salaries of National Civil Servants and Lowering the Standard of Living; This Measure Can Save One Hundred Million Francs</h3>
<p>(Paris) A total of 23 decree-laws regarding balancing the budget, reducing government spending, and reducing administrative costs have been promulgated today. In general, these financial measures can be summarized as follows: (1) Eliminate all improper expenditures and strive to avoid abuse. (2) Reduce all extra expenditures. (3) All administrative expenses will be paid at 90%. (4) Increase securities tax. Those with income over 8,000 francs will be subject to a special tax in addition to the regular income tax. In addition, the arms industry will also be subject to a special tax. After the implementation of the above measures, the national budget can be reduced by 7,063,000,000 francs, the local budget by 1,385,000,000 francs, the railway budget by 2,316,000,000 francs, and other reductions by 195,000,000 francs, for a total reduction of 10,959,000,000 francs. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a meeting in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to discuss the content of various decrees for implementing the full power law on finance. The meeting lasted from morning until midnight, with only a brief pause for meals. The various decrees were sent to the Presidential Palace at midnight, and President Lebrun signed them for promulgation. It is generally believed that the main methods of saving government expenses and reducing the cost of living stipulated in the decree include the following: (1) Salaries, preferential treatment, and supplies for state-owned enterprises will be paid at 90%. (2) Civil servants' salaries will be reduced according to a progressive rate: 3% for annual salaries below 8,000 francs, 5% for those between 8,000 francs and 10,000 francs, and 10% for all those above 10,000 francs. (3) In addition, measures to reduce the cost of living include a 10% reduction in rent, a 10-cent reduction in the price of bread per kilogram, and price reductions for gas, electricity, and coal. (4) Regarding income tax, it is proposed to increase it progressively. For those with income above 80,000 francs, an additional 50% will be levied in addition to the current tax rate. In addition, the securities tax will be increased from 17% to 24%. (5) A 25% tax will be levied on the profits of the munitions industry. The above is a glimpse of the content of the decree. After the implementation of this decree, total national expenditures can be saved by 700 million francs. In addition, 300 million can be saved in various provinces, cities, and railways, for a total expected savings of 1 billion francs. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The impression caused by the government's 20 decrees is quite good. The banking sector now believes that the price of public bonds can be expected to recover as a result, and negotiations on stabilizing the currency are closer. However, the government is now pursuing an austerity policy and expressing its determination to maintain the current price of the franc, so there is no question of devaluation of the franc. It is generally expected that civil servants will not have major objections. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval has now split the combination of civil servants and workers and completely dismantled the "Popular Front" by reducing civil servants' salaries on the one hand and reducing rents on the other, thus benefiting workers. Outside of admiring Laval's courage and determination, the London press is unwilling to express any definite opinion. Securities brokers and bankers are all waiting for the reaction of the French people and asking each other: Will civil servants accept the pay cuts peacefully? Will landlords and armaments merchants regard the government's orders as discriminatory plans? The future of the franc will depend on the reaction of large businesses to the 10% reduction in public bond interest rates. Some people fear that continued interest rate reductions will lead to the sale of all bonds, but the government's orders have balanced the budget and restored much of France's financial credit.

(Dentsu, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory issued an earthquake report this morning, stating that the major earthquake in Hsinchu Prefecture this morning was an aftershock of the major earthquake on April 21. Aftershocks of this magnitude may occur in the future. There were also earthquakes in China, Shikoku, and northern Kyushu in Japan this morning. The earthquake was stronger northeast of Fukuoka City and in Yamaguchi Prefecture, but there was not much damage. (United Chinese Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Central Meteorological Observatory issued a statement regarding the earthquake in Taiwan as follows: This earthquake in Taiwan is an aftershock of the previous major earthquake. It is not yet possible to determine whether there will be vibrations of this magnitude in the future, but the frequent occurrence of considerable damage is due to the incomplete construction of houses in Taiwan. Therefore, the reconstruction of houses is an urgent task. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<p>Taipei: All of the victims of this major earthquake in the Taipei area are Taiwanese natives. The areas most severely affected are the Gongsiliao of Miaoli County and the Houjing Zhuang of Zhunan County, but the situation has not yet been ascertained. The victims in Gongsiliao have been successively escaping. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Extends a Meeting with Director-General Watanabe; Meeting of Military Councilors Convened; Major Personnel Changes to be Announced Next Month</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Director-General Watanabe received a telegram from the Minister of the Army at 8:00 AM this morning and returned to Tokyo. He immediately requested an exchange of views with the Minister of the Army. The Minister of the Army explained the policy of strengthening the control of the army internally and the content of the personnel changes. Watanabe expressed his agreement. The issue of personnel changes to be announced in August does not need to be discussed in the chiefs' meeting and can be implemented according to the established policy. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army held an informal military councilors' meeting at 1:00 PM on the 17th in the Ministry of the Army. Minister of the Army Hayashi, and councilors Hishikari, Masaki, Abe, Araki, Matsui, and Kawashima attended. The Minister of the Army explained the process of changing the Director-General of Education. The newly appointed Director-General Watanabe gave a speech. The councilors questioned the Minister of the Army about the reasons for changing the Director-General. The Minister of the Army responded in detail. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The informal military councilors' meeting was held from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM in the conference room of the Ministry of the Army. The meeting lasted four hours, attracting attention from all sides. Fearing that it would easily lead to misunderstandings, the Ministry of the Army announced the content of the meeting at 6:30 PM as follows: The councilors' meeting today was originally a routine meeting. First, the Deputy Chief of Staff spoke about the recent situation of the Kwantung Army. Next, the minister and the new and old Director-Generals of Education made customary remarks regarding the change. All members present expressed their appreciation for the efforts of the former Director-General. Next, regarding the future guidance of the national army, the councilors exchanged views and discussed it fully, and then discussed other sections before adjourning. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) General Masaki's opinions differed from those of Minister of the Army Hayashi, and he was forced to resign. The Minister of the Army's forceful measures were based on the internal situation of the army, believing that there was a need for thorough cleaning and strengthening of control. General Masaki's opinions on such major issues, since they differed from those of the Minister of the Army, and still holding a key position as a military councilor, would have a major impact on the unification of the military. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate for General Masaki's reputation as a soldier. It is generally expected that Masaki will definitely resign from all current official duties and retire to the reserve army. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The dismissal of General Masaki, Director-General of Military Education of the Japanese Ministry of the Army, is a topic of criticism for newspapers here. The newspapers recognize this as a victory for the steady elements in the Japanese army and predict that the Ministry of the Army will implement other plans to rectify discipline. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Another Dispute Between Japan and Russia; Two Russians Arrested by "Manchukuo" Police, Kwantung Army Suspects Conspiracy</h3>
<p>(Changchun) On June 11, the "Manchukuo" police team arrested two Russians at the Pukelaniqi Najiye Station who had a major purpose for entering "Manchukuo." After strict interrogation, they claimed to be senior officials of the Ussuri Railway, named I. Ailin and Yeroslaviz. The two confessed that they had entered "Manchukuo" under secret orders from the Soviet Union, and had ambushed "Manchukuo" officials on patrol and kidnapped a police inspector. However, the Soviet Consul General in Harbin requested Special Envoy Shi Luben from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to extradite the two and filed a protest. The Kwantung Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are very indignant about the Soviet conspiracy and have decided to resolve the issue with a tough stance. The whereabouts of the kidnapped police inspector are still unknown. (Dentsu, 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to the "Harbin Times," the "Manchukuo" government, because the Soviet government refused to establish "Manchukuo" consulates in Hailanpao and Bolii, and only allowed the "Manchukuo" government to establish one consulate each in Chita and Heihe, has decided to reduce the six Soviet consulates in "Manchukuo" to two in retaliation. It is expected that the Soviet authorities will be given a deadline of four months to implement this. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Fishery Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding fishery negotiations, on the 16th, according to a report from Ambassador Ota stationed in the Soviet Union to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Union is still reluctant to Japan's requests, and strongly opposes the abolition of the auction system in particular. Negotiations are completely stalled. The Soviet Union's claims are roughly as follows: (1) Abolition of the auction system demanded by Japan and determining the acquisition of fishing areas through agreements. They are absolutely opposed on the grounds that the auction has always been very fair, and that new fishing areas to be auctioned in the future will be reduced. (2) Oppose Japan-Soviet joint facilities to protect fish stocks. (3) Regarding the ruble conversion rate, Japan claims around 10%, while the Soviet Union demands raising it above the current 3.25%. (4) Regarding the allocation of fishing areas, the Japanese side claims that the number of state-owned fishing areas should be equal to the fixed fishing areas held by Japan, while the Soviet Union claims that state-owned fishing areas should account for the majority. (5) Restrictions on cooperative fishing areas. The Japanese side demands strict regulations, which the Soviet Union refuses. (Rengo, 17th)</p>
<h3>American Business Leaders Fete US Fact-Finding Mission; Forbes Criticizes Government Silver Policy in Speech; China Needs Foreign Investment</h3>
<p>(New York) Today, more than 150 business leaders in this city gave a luncheon to the American economic fact-finding mission that had just returned from the Far East. The chairman of the mission, Forbes, gave a speech, vigorously attacking the adverse effects of the American silver policy on China. Forbes also stated that the trade deficit between the United States and Japan is too great for Japan to bear. Therefore, Japan may soon purchase important raw materials from elsewhere, especially cotton. When Forbes mentioned China, he strongly stated that China needs foreign financial assistance to build railways and steamships. Therefore, he suggested that the American business community should invest in China. As for the Philippine Islands, Forbes believes they are an important market for American goods. After Forbes's speech, the Chinese and Japanese Ambassadors to the United States, Shi Zhaoji and Saito, also gave speeches in succession, praising the efforts of the mission. The State Department had Far East Director Hornbeck give a speech on behalf of Secretary of State Hull, saying that the results of the mission's visit to the Far East should be beneficial to trade between China and Japan with the United States, and this trade should benefit all countries involved. Mr. Shi Zhaoji's speech reiterated China's commitment to maintaining the open-door policy and predicted that Sino-American trade would develop greatly because China will soon industrialize, and at that time, foreign goods and capital will be greatly needed, and he will also strive to promote exports. Forbes's reference to the adverse impact of American silver policy on China was as follows: "There is no doubt that the US silver policy has seriously harmed the Chinese business community. If the US currency can be stabilized, many businesses in China will not fail." (Guomin, 16th)</p>

<h3>Romanian-Russian Military Alliance; Possible Realization; Speculation by Czech Newspaper</h3>
<p>Prague: The Czech Daily News, the organ of Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, predicts that Soviet Russia and Romania will conclude a military agreement. The agreement will effectively make Romania a base of operations for Soviet troops in wartime. The newspaper stated that, according to French news reports, the passage of Soviet troops through Romanian territory will be an important issue for Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu to discuss in Moscow. This agreement could greatly enhance the effectiveness of the Soviet-Czech pact, as the Little Entente and Soviet Russia would form a military bloc, which is feared by Germany. (Guomin, 16th)</p>
<h3>America Expands Air Force Strength</h3>
<p>House Military Committee Requests Funds; Adds 700 Aircraft; Another Giant Aircraft Completed</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Military Affairs Committee has begun its campaign to request Congress to allocate $40 million to build 600 to 800 aircraft. This campaign was decided after long discussions between the House Military Affairs Committee and key Army personnel, such as the Secretary of War. It is said that its purpose is to expand the combat power of the US Army Air Corps. The Army Department told the Military Affairs Committee that the Air Corps needs 700 more aircraft to be equivalent to the strength advocated by the investigative committee. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Seattle: An aircraft factory here has recently completed a giant aircraft, the largest American aircraft.

At an altitude of 3,000 meters, the flight speed can reach 275 kilometers per hour, and it can continue flying in the air for 6 to 10 hours. The maximum climbing power can reach 7,500 meters. The aircraft is equipped with several machine guns. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Emperor Inspects the Navy</h3>
<p>Battleship Royal Authority: Amidst the brilliant sunshine today, the British Emperor stood on the bridge of the royal yacht Victoria and Albert, receiving the salute of the entire fleet off Spithead. The Crown Prince, the Duke of York, and the Duke of Connaught accompanied him. 157 warships were arranged in a ten-mile area, along with a hundred other ships fully decorated with flags and banners. The Emperor, in naval attire, looked to be in excellent health. This afternoon, he sailed from Portsmouth to begin the commemorative review of his reign. As the royal yacht left the harbor, the Emperor saw warships and large merchant ships lined up in long rows. Before the review began, the Emperor took his position as Commander-in-Chief of the fleet. His three sons stood below the bridge, while the Emperor stood alone on the bridge, keenly observing left and right with the sharp eyes of a naval expert. Each time he passed a ship, the sailors cheered enthusiastically, and the aircraft of the attached fleet tilted their noses down to show their respect. It was a truly magnificent sight. The Duke of Gloucester was not on the royal yacht, but on the bridge of the Australian cruiser HMAS Australia, saluting his father. The future flagship of the Indian Navy, INS India, represented India in the grand ceremony, with officers from Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa on board. Then, eighteen battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers fired a twenty-one-gun salute. The guards on each ship presented arms, and the band played the national anthem. Its solemnity was rarely seen. Crowds of people gathered along several miles of the coastline, most of whom stayed until night to watch the lights and searchlights shine in all directions. After the royal yacht returned to its original anchorage, the Emperor received the captains of the various ships, and the crews of merchant ships and fishing boats were also allowed to attend the audience to show the democracy in the ocean. Tomorrow, the Emperor will lead the fleet into a mock battle on the royal yacht. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Crack Down on Communists</h3>
<p>Nearly 200 People Arrested; Female Leader is a Young University Student</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Communist Party has recently begun to be active again. The Metropolitan Police Department, aware of this fact, secretly conducted investigations. From July 2nd to 16th, they have arrested the top leader, Shigeo Ueyama, 18 executives, and 189 party members (including 37 female members). Orders for the Japanese Communist Party used to come from the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai. However, this time, the movement relayed orders from the American Communist Party. The method used was the "lucky letter" that was popular in the world for a while, or other magazines, to work on the defendants in prison. The leader of the female party members arrested this time is Michiko Ozawa, a student at Tokyo Women's University, a beautiful young woman of 27 years old. (Japan United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the large-scale arrest of the reborn Communist Party in May 1934, the Ministry of Home Affairs believed that the communist movement in the country had disappeared. However, when another party member was arrested in March of this year, he confessed that the Japanese Communist Party had a new organization. The Police Bureau and the National Police encouraged to step up the search. It was not until the end of June that the full picture was known. An order was issued to mobilize the national police. From July 2nd to July 15th, a total of 180 Japanese people, including Kageyama, and Koreans, including Kim, were arrested, all of whom belonged to the central part of the Communist Party. Among them, there were 32 female party members. The details are not yet clear and are currently being investigated at the police station. (China United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>Manchester Chamber of Commerce Report on Trade with China</h3>
<p>Business in Cotton Goods, etc. is Sluggish; Urges Government to Pay Attention to Japanese Competition</p>
<p>(London) A delegation of representatives from the textile, chemical, and machinery industries of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce today submitted a report to the Ministry of Commerce on British trade in China. This report was prepared by the China and Far East division of the Chamber of Commerce and details the unfavorable situation of British machinery, chemicals, and heavy industry in China, discusses the future of British policy toward China, and asks the government to pay special attention to Japanese competition. In recent months, several submissions have been made to the government from various parties. The Manchester Chamber of Commerce report is just one of them. The attention of the British people to Chinese affairs has never been greater than it is now. The progress made by the Nanjing government, its financial difficulties, and especially Japan's aggressive policies and commercial competition, have given the people of the whole country a sense that Britain's indifferent policy in the Far East in recent years must be replaced by a more active policy. Business leaders here who have commercial relations with China feel the need to avoid any form of opposition to Japan, believing that for the sake of happiness in the Far East, it is advisable to seek Japan's cooperation. Japan's special interests in the Far East should be recognized, but Japan should also give the same recognition to all the interests of China and foreign countries, so that things can be successful.

<h3>German Steel Helmet League's Relationship with the Government Deteriorates</h3>
<p>45 Branches Dissolved</p>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, the relationship between the Steel Helmet League and the government has gradually deteriorated. Forty-five branches of the Steel Helmet League in the Baden area were dissolved because they opposed the National Socialist movement. Yesterday afternoon, the Steel Helmet League originally planned to host a delegation of British veterans in Berlin, but it was temporarily cancelled, probably due to government prohibition. Today, the authorities dissolved the Steel Helmet League branches in Taeso and Kordan for actions that endangered the country. Also, the leader of the Steel Helmet League in the Port of Kiel was sentenced to seven days in prison for making provocative speeches. In prison, he wrote a note to his friend, saying that he would never commit suicide, and if he died in prison, he must have been murdered, and asked for redress. (Havas, 17th)</p>

The central reserve fund will of course supplement the inadequacy of the provinces and cities. However, how to decide is still up to the custody committee to discuss.

Xu finally told reporters that the frequent disasters are all caused by floods, and fundamental measures should be taken to increase a good tax revenue and raise huge amounts of money on a monthly basis to specialize in water conservancy. The term should be ten years, and the success of the matter should be guaranteed, so that the Jianghuai Rivers and Lakes can be harmed and benefited, and disasters can be avoided.

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Titles omitted. To all concerned: I, Yanshi, is located in an area with mountains to the north and south, and the Yi and Luo rivers running through it. Droughts and floods easily become disasters. Since 1928, there has been no year without disasters, including war, bandits, drought, and locusts. Floods have been especially severe. An investigation of the 1931 Yi and Luo rivers outbreak showed that the levees collapsed and flooded the city. Of the seven districts in the county, five were affected. The water depth in the city was more than one zhang, and the shallowest was five or six chi. Government offices and businesses were mostly flooded. This time, the water depth was over three zhang, more than one zhang higher than in 1931. The entire city was submerged. Here are the real facts: This year, from spring to summer, there was no rain for several months. The wheat harvest was poor and autumn sowing was not done. Just as we were looking forward to rain, it suddenly rained lightly on July 6th. It started raining heavily on the 7th and continued non-stop into the night. At 12:00, the Yi and Luo rivers suddenly rose sharply and the water surrounded the city walls. The county government led all agencies and the people to try their best to defend until 12:00 noon on August 8th, when the water breached the levee in the northeast corner. After another two hours of rescue efforts, breaches were reported nearby, and alarming reports came from the southwest, leading to resignation. We retreated to the city gates and ordered the people to flee for their lives. By 5:00 p.m., the water had collapsed the southeast gates, and both the northwest gates had been flooded. All the houses in the city collapsed. The city was surrounded and communication was cut off. The power lines were down. The county government was trapped in the Daxian Building, the middle school students were trapped in the Zunjing Pavilion, and the higher primary school was trapped in the Ercheng Pavilion. More than 2,000 people who did not escape fled to the north city wall and the high hall behind the Minsheng Factory. Before long, night fell. Many people were still on treetops or rooftops, and their cries were unbearable to hear. No less than several hundred people drowned. There were approximately 1,000 head of livestock. The sanitation team is currently verifying and hiring people to bury them. All equipment, clothing, food, and business goods have been submerged, the value of which is incalculable. On the 9th, the county government escaped and temporarily moved to the higher primary school north of the city to conduct business. The situation inside the city is like this, and the situation in the other districts is a vast expanse of water. The magnitude of the disaster is imaginable. In addition to reporting to the higher authorities, we hereby respectfully submit this to charitable organizations both in China and abroad, hoping that you will show great compassion and provide assistance. We are in extreme distress awaiting your orders. Yanshi County Relief Branch Temporary Disaster Relief Association (seal). Extremely Urgent. Shanghai Red Cross Society, Red Swastika Society, all newspapers, newspapers in all provinces and cities, and please forward to all charitable organizations for consideration. In Yichang County, Hubei, heavy rain poured down from the morning of July 3rd, and mountain floods broke out, continuing for five days and nights. The river water rose sharply and overflowed, causing the villages and towns along the river in the first district to become a watery world. The towns of Xiaoxita, Xujiahe, and Houping in the fourth district were especially severely affected. Fields, crops, and houses were all swept away by the floods, and countless people and livestock died. In total, the disaster area covers more than 100 li, and there are more than 100,000 victims, with scenes of displacement and mourning everywhere. This catastrophic disaster is unprecedented. This association witnessed the tragic situation and felt deeply saddened. We immediately organized and established emergency relief efforts and rushed to provide assistance. On the one hand, we telegraphed the provincial and central governments to allocate funds for emergency relief. However, the disaster area is vast, and there are many victims. A drop in the bucket cannot provide universal relief. Therefore, we are making a wide appeal and asking for donations. We hope that kind people from all walks of life will show compassion and generously donate, and also help with fundraising, so that the survivors of this disaster can receive compassionate aid, get out of misery and enter comfort, and bring boundless blessings.

<h3>Dangerous Situation in Wuhan, Two Lines of Defense Built: Materials and Labor Responsible by Chamber of Commerce and Party Department, Zhang Gong Dyke Vulnerable Points Rescued Separately, Those who Fail to Supervise Executed</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, July 16th. As the river water continues to recede, the Wuhan dikes are still not out of danger. Cracks, subsidence, and seepage have occurred successively in various sections of the Zhang Gong Dyke, including Qiaokou, Huangjingtang, Hezi Watchtower, Huangjiadawan, Xiaowan, Jingkou, Zhayangang, Gusaoshu, and Jinyintan, but they have not yet been completely repaired. Moreover, collapses or leaks have been found at the Daijiashan and Edong Automobile Road dike sections, and on the embankment line from Daijiashan to the Bozi Watchtower. Ye Peng, the garrison commander in charge of flood control, is stationed on the dike day and night in this tense situation, inspecting and supervising the work. He also organized a military law office to use military orders to urge employees to work hard on rescue efforts. All the collapses, subsidence, and seepage are being repaired separately, and the work is about to be completed. At 3:00 a.m. on the 16th, Ye inspected the various sections and discovered that Li Cheng, a service member of the police department, had failed to supervise the work effectively and had delayed the opportunity. He was executed on the Gusaoshu dike and issued a notice stating: "Investigation reveals that the rescue work has been extremely urgent in recent days. All of our flood control personnel should be responsible and diligent, and promptly go to the scene. However, Li Cheng, a service member of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, failed to supervise the work effectively and delayed the opportunity. He is hereby sentenced to death as a warning. In the future, all personnel ordered to control floods, regardless of which agency they belong to, will be subject to military law if they are found to be negligent or delayed in performing their duties. All must comply." Before Ye unified command of the dike, the civilians were often not fed and there was no punishment for dereliction of duty, resulting in disorganization and many dangers. After Ye unified command, the civilians received food, and those who performed well were given an additional reward of two dimes per day in addition to their six dimes in wages. Those who failed to supervise the work effectively were also severely punished. Because of the clear rewards and punishments, all the employees were shocked and motivated. The reporter inspected the dike on the 16th and saw that the situation had completely changed, and the degree of danger seemed to be gradually decreasing. It is believed that success depends on human effort. However, the water is fierce and the dike body is weak, making it difficult to repair completely. If there is any negligence, the entire city will still be at risk of being submerged. In order to fundamentally protect Wuhan, government, military, and business leaders held an emergency joint meeting at the Chamber of Commerce at 6:00 p.m. on the 16th. Mayor Wu Guozhen reported that the Zhang Gong Dyke surrounding the city is experiencing repeated dangers. The Fenjinlu section has had three instances of water seepage, and the Sixhegou Asia section also has many cracks. Danshuichi, which was the first place to breach in 1931, also had a breach of about 300 meters long a few days ago. The Guanghua section had a crack of about 30 meters long. There was a surge of water in one section of the dike corner. Daijiashan also had a leak today. The water in Jintan and Yintan almost overflowed. The Gusaoshu dike collapsed by half. Although it has been rescued, it is still not out of danger. The entire city of Wuhan is still threatened by water. We should seek a safe plan, he said. It was then decided to designate the Zhang Gong Dyke as the first line of defense and continue to rush to repair the dangerous areas. The Pinghan Railway embankment base was designated as the second line of defense, and all were raised. The Chamber of Commerce is responsible for purchasing approximately 70,000 sacks, and the Municipal Party Department is responsible for gathering workers. If necessary, all factories in the city will be closed, vehicles will be suspended from rental, and workers will be mobilized to repair the dike, which must be completed within five days.

<h3>XuZhou and Neighboring Regions: Joint Efforts to Prevent Yellow River Floods, Deciding to Build a Large Embankment on the South Bank of Weishan Lake and Dispatch Representatives to Inspect the Lanfeng Stone Dam</h3>
<p>XuZhou Correspondence: A breach occurred in the Juye and Linpu areas of southwestern Shandong, causing the Yellow River's waters to flow rapidly southeastward. In just a few days, it had already passed Yuncheng and Juye counties, and was poised to flow directly into northern Jiangsu, inundating Weishan Lake. If the main current arrives, it will inevitably divert the Grand Canal, joining it with the Huai River in the XuZhou area. The counties in that area will be hit first and will be in a state of urgency. Upon receiving the alert from Shandong Province, the Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed the Tongshan Qu Commissioner's Office on the 12th, urging them to pay close attention to prevention. Commissioner Shao Hanyuan immediately sent telegrams to Tongshan, Pei, Feng, Dangshan, Xiao, and Pi counties, instructing them to prepare for flood prevention as quickly as possible. As of the 16th, the construction of embankments in Tongshan, Pei, and Feng counties, as well as flood prevention along the Grand Canal in Pi county, and the prevention of the former Yellow River's course in Tongshan, Xiao, and Dangshan counties, were all underway. Fortunately, the water coming from southwestern Shandong is still flowing relatively slowly. However, if the main current continues to arrive, the situation will remain precarious.</p>
<p>Weishan Lake's Situation</p>
<p>Weishan Lake is situated between Tongshan and Pei counties in the XuZhou region and Yutai and Yi counties in southern Shandong. It is connected to Zhaoyang and Nanyang lakes in Shandong Province to the north, reaching Jinning, and connected to the Grand Canal mouth in Hanzhuang to the southeast, reaching the central section of the Grand Canal in Pi and Su counties. The southwest and south banks of the lake, along the borders of Pei and Tongshan counties, are connected to the Da Shao Ke in Pei county and the Wanzhai River in Tongshan county. This lake serves as the only water storage area in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. Within the lake is Weishan Mountain, where the tomb of Weizi is located. In the past, before the grain transport system was abolished, it was a waterway for smooth north-south passage. The lake's accumulation was deep and wide, providing resources for grain transport. Since the abolition of the grain transport route, the lake has become silted and shallow, reducing its capacity. The dried-up areas along the lake have largely become fertile fields. Each time the Yellow River breaches in southwestern Shandong, Weishan Lake inevitably serves as the final destination. An increase in the lake's water level results in either the submersion of lake fields in a minor case, or the overflow of water into the Grand Canal in a serious case, affecting the waterways connecting Tongshan and Pei to the lake. This is because a small amount of water can still be contained by Weishan Lake, but a large amount of water will inevitably be expelled by Weishan Lake. If the Yellow River changes course and the main current arrives, it will inevitably overflow westward, inundating Feng and Pei counties, overflow southward, inundating Tongshan county, and overflow eastward, diverting the Grand Canal. Pi, Su, and Sui, as well as various districts in the Huai River region, will all become areas for flood discharge. The XuZhou and Huai River regions will face unprecedented disaster, with the XuZhou region bearing the brunt.</p>
<p>Organizing a Joint Flood Prevention Effort</p>
<p>Upon receiving the provincial order, Commissioner Shao, in addition to instructing various counties to implement flood prevention measures, dispatched Yu Keyu, the chief of the First Section of the Commissioner's Office, to Pei county on the 12th, as Pei county is located directly on the south bank of Weishan Lake and its city walls are built along the lake, and is also the tenth most important city. Yu was tasked with guiding the organization of a flood prevention committee and expediting all related work. After arriving in Pei county, Yu, together with County Magistrate Su Min, invited local figures to establish a flood prevention committee and went to Sanshui Tower to investigate the water situation. According to a report on the 15th, the Yellow River's water had already passed Juye and reached the Niutou River between Jinxiang and Yutai. The water flow seemed relatively slow. Fishermen on Weishan Lake, who have considerable experience in this matter, stated that at this speed, it would take ten days for the water to reach Pei county, unless there is a major surge. However, according to a telegram from Tian Suixiang, a staff member dispatched by the Commissioner's Office to Jining to investigate the water situation, to XuZhou on the 16th, Shandong Province is currently busy with disaster relief efforts and is unable to undertake flood prevention work due to the large breach. Thus, if Shandong Province is unable to actively work on preventing the breach, the continued arrival of a major surge remains a cause for concern, and the possibility of the Yellow River changing course is even more worrying. The Pei County Government has completely sealed off Weishan Lake's fishing boats to prepare for unforeseen events and is telegraphing the Commissioner's Office daily to report on the water situation to assist in prevention efforts.</p>
<p>Building an Embankment North of XuZhou</p>
<p>On the 13th and 14th, Commissioner Shao repeatedly summoned gentry from various counties to consult on flood prevention strategies. It was immediately decided to build a large embankment along the south bank of Weishan Lake, along the northern borders of Tongshan, Pei, and Feng counties, to prevent the flooding of the Yellow River into Weishan Lake. The embankment would run along the northern border of Feng county, the northeastern border of Pei county, and the northwestern border of Tongshan county, with a length of approximately 120 li. It was estimated that the embankment would be one zhang high, four zhang wide at the base, and one zhang wide at the top. After this plan was decided, Shao summoned representatives in charge of water conservancy from Tongshan, Pei, and Feng counties on the 15th for discussions. It was decided to begin construction on the 16th, with a deadline of 15 days for completion. Shao traveled to Pei county by car on the 16th to supervise the county magistrates of Pei and Feng in recruiting laborers for construction. Wang Gongyu, the county magistrate of Tongshan, also led mounted police to Weishan Lake on the afternoon of the 16th to recruit laborers for construction in the second, third, and fifth districts along the lake. Engineer Wang Shiyi, dispatched by the Construction Department and stationed in XuZhou, has already accompanied Shao to Pei county. The Construction Department has also dispatched Yu Shufang, a technical specialist, to XuZhou to assist in guiding the construction. It is expected that the completion of this embankment will serve as a barrier for the five counties of Feng, Pei, Tongshan, Xiao, and Dangshan. If the Yellow River changes course and flows into Weishan Lake, the effectiveness of flood prevention will depend on the strength of the embankment. However, if additional embankments are built outside the main one, it could create substantial new fertile fields.</p>
<p>Telegraphing for Canal Flood Prevention</p>
<p>The Grand Canal has been blocked for a long time, resulting in unsmooth water flow. The entrance of the Grand Canal into Weishan Lake used to have sturdy sluice gates, allowing for free storage and discharge, but it has been neglected for a long time. The construction of an embankment north of XuZhou is primarily intended to shield the northwest of the XuZhou area, while the northeastern and eastern regions, along with the sections of the Grand Canal in the Huai River area, have also implemented prevention measures in response to telegrams from the Construction Department. According to a telegram from Suqian on the 16th, the central section of the Grand Canal has risen by one chi. However, as this occurred before the Yellow River's water entered Weishan Lake, it can be inferred that the rise in the central section of the Grand Canal is due to the influx of rivers. It also indicates that the Grand Canal is blocked and unsmooth, reducing its capacity.</p>
<p>Repairing Embankments and Inspecting Dams</p>
<p>Tongshan, Dangshan, and Xiao counties, located along the former course of the Yellow River, all have old embankments that are incomplete and dilapidated. The former course connects to Lanfeng. The stone dam in Lanfeng is crucial for the safety of the XuZhou region. Since the Yellow River breached in eastern Henan and flooded the XuZhou region the year before last, the people of XuZhou have been appealing for the reconstruction of the Lanfeng stone dam. Eventually, with the help of funds from Jiangsu Province, the dam was completed this spring. The Commissioner's Office specially summoned representatives from seven counties in the XuZhou region to form a tour group, led by Wang Picheng, the Chief of Staff of the Commissioner's Office. On the 15th, they traveled west by car to Lanfeng to inspect the stone dam project. The group of over ten people is scheduled to return to XuZhou on the 17th. In Tongshan, the county government convened a meeting of townships and towns in the first district on the 16th to discuss the restoration of the encircling embankment along the former Yellow River's course. It was decided to begin repairing the embankment in sections immediately. The terrain of the town is several zhang lower than the former Yellow River's course, relying solely on the embankment for protection. The embankment was damaged once by a military unit building a public cemetery and again by the sale of government-owned land by the government land reclamation office. When the flood from eastern Henan inundated XuZhou the year before last, a committee was established to repair the embankment, but it only made superficial repairs. After the event passed, it was forgotten. Now, the county government has decided to completely restore it to maintain the town's safety. All the counties have already mobilized their workforces.

<h3>Shandong Province: Juye Suffers the Most Severe Disaster - Yellow River's Waters Reach Nanwang Lake</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the breaches in Dongzhuang and Linpu of the Shandong Yellow River, the main current has surged. Another stream from Shangshikou in Heze has rushed madly south-east, directly into the Juye county territory. Therefore, the disaster situation in Juye is particularly serious among the disaster areas in western Shandong. Now the county seat of the county has been surrounded, and the west, north and east are all in swamps. The flooded area is one hundred li east-west, and forty-five li north-south. There are five hundred villages, all submerged in water. The number of disaster victims reaches 200,000, and food and shelter are both lacking. The situation is too terrible to bear. Xu Zhongcheng, the county magistrate of the county, and the flood relief committee, telegraphed the provincial government on the 16th and requested a huge amount of money to be allocated quickly for emergency relief to save the lives of the people. Li Wenqi, a standing committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Department, and Wang Yingxin, the deputy director of the Rural Construction Research Institute, carried 10,000 yuan of provincial funds to the disaster areas of western Shandong for emergency relief to save the suffering people. On the 14th, they arrived in Juye. Recently, a report arrived in the province, stating that the disaster situation is extremely serious and the worst of all the counties in western Shandong. The flooded area is 1,400 square li, with more than 290 villages. Ships are now being hired to rush to rescue the disaster victims trapped by the water, and emergency relief is being provided.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Heze is also extremely serious. According to a telegram from Wang Shaochang, the chief of the actual examination district, the main current of the Yellow River headed straight for more than 100 villages near Shangshikou, Heze, and plunged them into the water. The situation is too terrible to bear, and active rescue is underway. A breach occurred at Meihuazhuang in Wenshang, with a gate width of 16 meters and a depth of 3 meters. The Yellow River's water has flowed to the southern part of Nanwang Lake. The disaster situation is serious, and the counties are rushing to build dams and embankments and urgently implement relief measures. (16th)</p>
<h3>Yuan Shu Case: Hubei High Court Opens Trial, Yuan Firmly Denies Ever Joining the Communist Party, Trial Ends, Verdict Scheduled for 20th</h3>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: Yuan Shu, also known as Yuan Xueyi, who was involved in the Joseph Valton case in Shanghai, a westerner with a notorious left-wing literary reputation who once served as an editor for the Foreign Affairs Agency, surrendered himself to the Songhu Garrison Command after the westerner was arrested. He was sent to the Wuchang Military Commission Chairman's Headquarters and handed over to the Hubei Higher Court for investigation, which filed a public prosecution against him for endangering the Republic of China. The court opened the trial at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th. The president of the first criminal court, Zuo Jingchang, judge Xiong Sichang, and Hu Shi'ao summoned Yuan Shu to the case. Prosecutor Lian and Ge Xiujian and Zhang Yeyu, the lawyers selected by Yuan, also took their seats. The prosecutor first stated the purpose of the prosecution, saying that the defendant in this case was a key figure in the left-wing cultural movement, often expressing dissatisfaction with the current social situation in his articles, and was therefore noticed by the Communist Party, which absorbed him and appointed him as the chief editor of Chinese for the China Forum, promoting doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. He had committed the crime of endangering the Republic of China according to Article 6 of the Emergency Punishment Law, so the prosecutor specially filed a lawsuit for a public ruling. As for the defendant's surrender, it was after Joseph Valton was found with various cards hidden on his person, so it cannot be said to be legitimate. However, his criminal circumstances, the pressure of life, and emotional impulses are not without their justifications, and should be judged appropriately. Then the chief judge Zuo questioned him in detail. Yuan's confession was roughly: he was 25 years old, from Qichun, studied for many years, but never graduated. In 1931, he edited the Literary Weekly. After the September 18th Incident, he also submitted poetry drafts to the Beidou Magazine. Because he was greatly stimulated by the September 18th Incident, and out of emotional impulse, his poems were dissatisfied with the current social situation, and his thoughts became increasingly left-leaning. After the January 28th Incident, before the Shanghai War Agreement, people in the left-wing literary world organized the China Forum and asked me to be the Chinese editor. Because I was unemployed, I agreed to take the job. After taking office, I found that the materials it received were mostly Communist propaganda texts. I was not a Communist, and I realized the fallacy of my previous thinking, so I generally did not publish Communist propaganda texts. Soon I wrote a paper on the united national front, attacking class struggle, and was immediately criticized by the Communist Party. I then broke away from it and became a reporter for the New Voice News Agency and also worked as an editor for the Foreign Affairs Translation Agency. The manuscripts I adopted were all anti-Communist. On May 21st of this year, the Songhu Garrison Department called me, and on the 23rd, I surrendered myself. If I were a Communist and had promoted it, why would I surrender myself, etc. Then Ge Xiujian, Yuan's defense lawyer, said that according to Article 68 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the facts of a crime should be determined based on evidence, and Article 69 states that the confession of the offender may be adopted as evidence if it is consistent with the facts. Although the China Forum is a reactionary publication, it is not yet known whether the two issues edited by the defendant contained any words promoting Communism. Criminal cases should discover the true facts, and cannot assume that he is promoting doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People just because he edited the China Forum. As for the defendant's surrender, it was before the prosecutor's determination that the facts of the crime were discovered. Joseph Valton's list of names hidden on his person is not a fact of the defendant's crime. You can't consider it illegal just because he surrendered after the list was found. According to the self-surrender rules, his punishment should be reduced. The defendant's criminal circumstances are also worthy of pity. Please give him a cumulative reduction. Furthermore, the defendant is a useful young man and the country is in urgent need of talent, so it would be appropriate not to enforce the penalty. Then the lawyer Zhang Yeyu argued that the defendant only confessed to editing the China Forum, but there is no evidence to prove that he promoted communism. Although the China Forum is a Communist publication, it is possible that it adopted anti-imperialist and other literary manuscripts that do not involve so-called doctrines. You cannot consider it a fact with presumptive words. He should be declared innocent, etc. At this point, the judge announced that the debate on this case was over and the verdict was scheduled for the 20th. The defendant was returned to custody. The court adjourned. (16th)</p>
<h3>Nanxiang</h3>
<p>Ancient Tombs Discovered During Road Construction in Guyi Garden</p>
<p>Guyi Garden is a famous scenic garden in Nanxiang. Since the January 28th Incident, Nanxiang was on the front line, and the garden suffered destruction by the Japanese army. After the settlement, local gentry such as Wang Quanshi initiated and organized a reorganization committee to design and construct the garden, giving the entire garden a completely new look. To facilitate transportation for foreign tourists, a new gate was opened at the south end of Zhuzhi Mountain last winter, connecting to the Xiangzhen Motor Road, which leads directly to the garden gate. Due to disputes with the landowner of the section, the plan could not be realized. It was not until mid-May of this year that an agreement was reached. On June 7th, road construction began, and suddenly an ancient tomb was discovered. It is said to have been buried during the Song Dynasty. Inside were two unique coffins, one made of Phoebe zhennan wood and the other of dark wood, as well as a foot washbasin. Later, the coffins were opened, and the corpses had not yet decomposed. Coffins will be re-matched and reburied. Inside the coffins were also more than 30 pieces of white jade, jadeite, porcelain, gold beads, etc., with considerable value. The committee has now properly stored and preserved the coffins, jadeite, porcelain, gold beads and other items.</p>

<p>Han Wentai, the former chief of Xuxie Township in the third district of this county, was kidnapped by bandits in March 1932, who extorted a huge amount of 2,500 yuan. Subsequently, Han's family paid the ransom in full, but the bandits still tore up the ticket. Han's son, Ke Liang, petitioned the authorities to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. After investigations by the Public Security Bureau, five bandits involved in the case, namely Zhou Zhihe, Yang Abao, Luo Sanxing, Li Zhiping, and Jiang Hanchen, were arrested one after another. After thorough interrogation, they were confirmed to be guilty and executed according to law. The remaining fugitives, including Chen Fugen, etc., were wanted by order. The other day, detective Zhong Lihe received a tip from an informant that Chen was hiding in Bao's capture at No. 43, Tieping Lane, Suzhou. He captured Chen and escorted him to the Fourth Sub-Bureau of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Head of a Kidnapping Gang Arrested and Brought to Justice</p>
<p>Jiang Yizheng and Lu Zonghan, who lived in Yuanjia Village, Danyang, have long been the leaders of a kidnapping gang. Between 1928 and 1929, they committed murder and kidnapping at the junction of Wu and Dan counties, doing all kinds of evil. In the winter of 1928, Jing Peiyin, the son of Jing Jiji of Dingqiao Town, Danyang, studied at Soochow University in Suzhou. On New Year's Eve, he returned home for the holidays. The two bandits Jiang and Lu led more than ten bandits, including the already convicted bandit Jing Hongsheng, and kidnapped Jing Peiyin, demanding a huge ransom. Before the ransom was fulfilled, they still tore up the ticket. In March 1929, Qi Zhihai was kidnapped from the Wang Clan Ancestral Hall in Xuanwang Village and shot dead. The families of the two victims filed separate lawsuits. Some of the gang members have been arrested and punished according to law, but Jiang Yizheng and Lu Zonghan have been detained repeatedly without success. This spring, Jiang Yizheng was arrested in Shanghai, and the Wuyi Court Procuratorate escorted him to Changzhou for trial. Unexpectedly, the net of justice is vast, and the bandit leader Lu Zonghan, who had been at large for seven or eight years, was also captured by the Danyang County Government. Upon hearing the news, the Local Court Procuratorate dispatched bailiffs to Changzhou on the 16th to escort him. After interrogation by Prosecutor Guan Junjie, he was ordered to be detained pending prosecution and trial by the Criminal Court.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Recently, I read newspapers from all over the place, which contained news that the Bahe Railway Bridge on the western section of the Longhai Railway was destroyed by water. I was very surprised. Since July 4th, along the Tongxi section of this road, there has been continuous rain, and mountain floods have occurred. The rivers have surged. After the Bahe River between Chang'an and Lintong was breached, it merged into hundreds of streams, resulting in two breaches of the embankment between Lintong and Zhouzhi, with a total length of more than 40 meters. The Engineering Section of the Administration is rushing to repair it, and it will be open to traffic soon. As for the bridges and culverts along the line, there is no damage. The news about the bridge being destroyed by water is probably a misunderstanding. In addition to sending letters to various newspapers to request corrections, I hope that your newspaper will publish the corrections. Sincerely, Shanghai Shen Bao, Longhai Railway West Section Engineering Bureau, July 13th.</p>

The reporter from the East China News Agency inquired about the number of registrations and the conditions of the patients at various seasonal disease hospitals after 7:00 p.m. yesterday. The Hongkou Seasonal Disease Hospital received 425 patients, including two cases of true cholera: (1) Lin Shixin, local, 18 years old, admitted to the hospital in the morning yesterday, cured at 2:00 p.m., and still hospitalized. (2) Li Chen, from Ningbo, 25 years old, admitted to the hospital at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and cured and discharged immediately. There were also cases of false cholera, palpitation, and gastroenteritis. According to Wang Boyuan, the president of the hospital, to the reporter from the East China News Agency, the prevention method for true cholera is to reduce food slightly more than usual before suffering from the disease, walk less in the hot sun, and get vaccinated from time to time. After suffering from the disease, in addition to sending to the hospital for first aid, you must also get a heatstroke vaccine. Last time, most of the patients with acute palpitation were from the working class. Factory owners should be especially cautious. Moreover, four people died at the Shanghai Seasonal Disease Hospital on Xizang Road yesterday due to being unable to be rescued from heatstroke: Shen Fangyuan (8-year-old child), Li Zhenshan (23 years old), Wang Zaochu (Ningbo man, 44 years old), and an old man with no name who was brought in from the road. The Emergency Seasonal Disease Hospital on North Xizang Road had 204 registered patients, including Wu Delin, a 26-year-old Hubei native, who died of heatstroke, and one person with false cholera who was resuscitated. As for the Red Cross Society General Branch Hospital, because it only provides temporary first aid, there are no registrations and it is difficult to count.</p>

<h3>Four New China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships Obtain International Maritime Safety Certificates; Can Apply for Passenger Permits Upon Presentation to Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have agreed to allow the new sea ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to employ Chinese crew members and issue passenger licenses. Now that the Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen ships of the company have arrived in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government is requested to inspect the ships and issue licenses so that passengers can be boarded as soon as possible.

<p>Hong Kong Requests Presentation of Ministry Certificates</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government recognizes Chinese sea ships and treats them equally with those of other countries. Now that the Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen ships have arrived in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Port Authority is requested to inspect the ship hulls to facilitate the issuance of passenger permits. The Hong Kong authorities stated that China is a signatory to the 1929 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and is eligible to receive the same treatment as international sea ships.

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Personnel to Obtain Certificates</p>
<p>The company has sent Zhou Houkun, deputy director of the Shipping Department, to Nanjing to contact Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Transportation and Gao Tingzi, Director of the Maritime Administration, to obtain the International Maritime Safety Certificates so that they can be forwarded to the sea ships to enable them to freely carry passengers on international coastlines.

<p>The International Maritime Safety Certificate states that the items stipulated in the 1929 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea have been inspected and approved as follows, and a safety certificate is issued for a period of one year, after which it must be applied for again. The ship meets the requirements of the convention regarding (1) hull, auxiliary boilers, and machinery, (2) configuration of watertight bulkheads and related details, (3) load lines on both sides of the hull amidships and the parts where passenger capacity can be varied, (4) lifeboats and life-saving equipment, its maximum limit, can be equipped with the number of passengers and crew members, respectively, for lifeboats, rafts, buoys, life rings, the number of life jackets qualified lifeboat crew members, and wireless equipment, listening time, and automatic alarm, etc., all must fill in the exact number.</p>
<p>Adding Electrical Equipment</p>
<p>The wireless equipment on the four sea ships is already very strict. Now, a further step has been taken. The Chief Shipowner of the Shipping Department has decided to add eight more wireless operators in addition to the original wireless operators, assigning two additional persons to each ship, who will be responsible for the wireless watch on each sea ship, so that there will be reliable wireless personnel on duty at all times, 24 hours a day, so that news will be more sensitive, and ordering all sea ships to close the double iron gates at the same time after sailing, so that passengers can be guaranteed safety.</p>
<p>Certificates Issued to Hong Kong for Licensing</p>
<p>The International Maritime Safety Certificates, which have been issued by the Ministry of Transportation, were filled out yesterday by the company in strict compliance with the regulations, based on the equipment conditions and the number of crew and passengers of the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen ships, etc. They were distributed to the captains of each ship, and upon arrival in Hong Kong, they will be presented to the Hong Kong government for review and passenger licenses will be obtained immediately. Therefore, tickets for the Haiheng and other ships will be sold on the next trip from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Shanghai will have to wait a few more days.</p>
<h3>International Wireless Telephone Trial Conversation Results in Success; Successful Test Calls to UK, Japan, Manila, etc. Audio Wave Clarity is Better Than Telephone; Opening Still Awaits</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to further facilitate international telecommunications traffic, after the successful Sino-British broadcast last year, immediately began preparing for international direct wireless telephone calls. All wireless telephone equipment, in addition to utilizing a portion of the original antenna and telephone, the majority of the equipment was ordered from the United Kingdom. Having long been transported to Shanghai, and under the responsibility of the Renji Road International Radio Station in this city for installation, it has been completed one after another. According to the spokesperson of the station, speaking to a New News Agency reporter, the International Radio Station, ordered to install wireless telephone equipment, has reported its completion. On June 8th, 12th and 17th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, using the terminal station installed at the Liu Administrative Reporting Station, trial conversations with the Tokyo Radio Station in Japan proved to have very clear audio quality. Recently, test calls with the United Kingdom and Manila have yielded excellent results. In the future, it will be gradually extended to other countries. As for the exact date of official conversation, it still awaits the superior agency and the respective countries to determine the contract and then schedule the opening. The International Radio Station is only responsible for the technical aspects. All communication equipment installations have a fixed direction, so it is not possible to use one machine to communicate with two countries at the same time. Overall, the results of the trial conversation showed that the audio wave was clearer than the local telephone. When officially opened in the future, it should be more convenient for Chinese and foreign individuals.</p>

<h3>Aid to the Siamese Overseas Chinese Association; Guangdong and Guangxi Aid Overseas Chinese Association Prohibit the Sale of Siamese Rice; Sales in Fujian and Guangdong Account for One-Quarter of the National Sales</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Groups United Association for Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam, after the last meeting's resolution on the incident of prohibiting the transportation and sale of Siamese rice, originally planned to send personnel to the Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou areas. Now that the Guangdong groups have established the Association for Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam, the association decided to send a letter to the Guangdong Aid Overseas Chinese Association, requesting them to handle the prohibition of transporting and selling Siamese rice in the Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou areas nearby. The association also included a detailed account of the process of prohibiting the transportation and sale of Siamese rice in Shanghai, requesting them to actively carry out the work. Because sales of Siamese rice in Shanghai only account for one-quarter of the national sales, and three-quarters are still transported and sold in the aforementioned areas, if the prohibition of transporting and selling Siamese rice in South China can follow the same steps as Shanghai, then the Siamese economy can be immediately sanctioned.</p>

It is learned that the overseas Chinese in Siam, because the Siamese government has not yet repented, are implementing a strike to show their firm opposition. The following is a record of the various situations.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Workers in Siam Strike in Opposition</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United Association in Siam telegraphed the Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association yesterday, saying, "Since there is no intention to repent, starting on the first day of this month, the Chinese merchant capital rice mill workers along the Mae Nam River have gone on strike, and the overseas Chinese fishermen in the more distant ports have also responded in unison. Siamese capital is agitated, and overseas Chinese have prepared for major sacrifices, vowing to oppose to the death. If these harsh regulations are not abolished, they will never return to work. I earnestly request the authorities to negotiate urgently to strengthen overseas Chinese sentiment and promote the awakening of the other party. The telegram is urgent and I await orders."</p>
<p>Guangdong Sends Representatives to Siam to Negotiate</p>
<p>Since Shanghai, Guangdong, Shantou, and Hong Kong have unanimously boycotted Siamese rice, Xiao Focheng of the Guangdong Provincial Committee telegraphed the Guangdong authorities, stating that the Siamese government has been greatly affected since China lowered Siamese rice, but there is still no indication of abolishing harsh regulations. It is better to send representatives to directly and seriously negotiate with the Siamese government to achieve results. It is learned that the Guangdong Provincial Authority has specially appointed Huang Linfang as the representative to go to Siam to negotiate the abolition of the harsh regulations on abuse of overseas Chinese and to comfort the overseas Chinese. Mr. Huang left the country for Siam on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Guangdong Aid Overseas Chinese Association Issues Declaration</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United Association received a declaration from the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Groups Aid Overseas Chinese Association yesterday, saying that American economic doctor Jia Feng has said that the leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors of Siam are overseas Chinese, and that the actual power of the economy is also controlled by overseas Chinese. King Rama VII of Siam also once said, "The only countries most related to world nationalities are China and Siam. The highest-ranking officials in Siam, whether past or present, are mostly Chinese." The words of Jia and the King of Siam can clearly understand the superior position of our overseas Chinese in Siam. However, this position was not obtained by force or cunning by our overseas Chinese, but by enduring hardships, facing dangers, and striving for the development and cultivation of Siam. Looking at the wilderness of Siam in the past, and now transformed into a magnificent port, it is the credit of the overseas Chinese who have cut through thorns. In the past, Siam's foreign trade was low, but now it has become a country with a surplus in the world, which is the special merit of the overseas Chinese's hard work. Other aspects such as the construction of transportation and culture are all operated and promoted by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, it can be asserted that Siam's prosperity today could not have been achieved without the hard work and efforts of the overseas Chinese. Since the two countries have such close ties, they should work together for the welfare of both countries to maintain peace in East Asia. Moreover, Siam was a tributary of our country in the past and should renew old ties. Now, there is no such plan. Enmity and gratitude are not distinguished, and news of various harsh regulations is sent, and the whole country is shocked. We shoulder the heavy responsibility of the masses, the danger of the overseas Chinese, and sincerely hope that the Siamese government will cancel all harsh regulations against overseas Chinese as soon as possible in order to maintain the commercial interests of the two countries. The two countries of China and Siam should promote friendship in order to promote the welfare of the country, and make plans for the welfare of the country from the perspective of the national government. The two countries of China and Siam should conclude a Sino-Siamese treaty as soon as possible. If the Siamese authorities can cherish the past intimacy between China and Siam, and weigh the interests of their respective national positions, and consider the changes in the international situation, they should live up to our expectations. If they still insist on their own way, and do not listen to human advice, we vow to use hot blood and sincerity to fight for the country's dignity and the overseas Chinese's extreme danger. This spirit will not be discouraged, blood can flow, this ambition will not change, this is declared.</p>
<h3>US Consulate General in Shanghai Building Fund Passed by the US Senate Yesterday; US President Will Also Approve</h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the American Chamber of Commerce in this city received a telegram from Washington representative Hao Erkang today (17th), stating that the Senate has passed the US Consulate General in Shanghai building fund of US$750,000 today, and President Luo will approve it in the next few days. The House of Representatives passed the case last month, so now, after President Luo approves it, construction can begin. President Luo's approval is likely to happen at the end of this week. Mr. Ke Ninghan, the US Consul General in Shanghai, was delighted by this news. However, whether the drawings of the new building of the US Consulate General, which were made in 1930, need to be revised to suit the latest style is a problem. It is said that the American Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting within a week to discuss this matter. The American Chamber of Commerce is the strongest advocate of this move, so naturally, it is very concerned about the drawings of the new building. The US Consulate General was originally located on the Bund of Huangpu Road, but because the buildings were old and dilapidated, they moved to the former site of the Ke Li Hotel on Jiangxi Road a few years ago. The new building will still be built on the original site of Huangpu Road.</p>
<h3>Locusts Passed Through This City Yesterday; Seemed to Fly From Pudong Towards the Southwest; Also Found in Baoshan County, and Precautions Have Been Taken</h3>
<p>According to the Da Bai News Agency, at 4:05 PM yesterday, a large number of locusts suddenly passed through this city, presumably flying across the Huangpu River from the Pudong area, passing through the French Concession and Huajie nearby, such as Route Lafayette, Route Geler, Lujiawan, and other places, flying towards the southwest. When passing through the above roads, the buzzing sound was very loud, and the sunlight was also obscured. Passersby all stood and watched, and after about ten minutes, they finished. It is expected that the batch of locusts will harm the fields of Jinshanwei, Minhang, Sijing, and other places along the south bank of the Huangpu River. According to people from Wusong, a few days ago, locusts were also found in the Baoshan County in that area, but only a very small number, staying for a few hours, and then flying towards Pudong. Therefore, after receiving the report, Baoshan County Magistrate Long Tiyao ordered his subordinates to take precautions and kill them to avoid harming agricultural products.</p>

<h3>Savings Guarantee Reserve Fund: Ministry of Finance Approves Land Deed Discount Payment; Restrictions on Banknote Issuance Reserve</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Trade Association, among others, previously submitted a petition to the Savings Guarantee Reserve Fund Custody Committee of the Central Bank, requesting that banks and companies in the city handling savings be allowed to include title deeds and land business licenses in the savings guarantee reserve fund they are required to pay. The Custody Committee, after deliberation, decided that title deeds with confirmed income and properly completed procedures would be allowed to be calculated at half the market price for payment of a quarter of the savings reserve guarantee fund, but not exceeding half of the total amount. This measure was submitted by the Custody Committee to the Ministry of Finance for review. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has approved the proposed measure and ordered its implementation, but has restricted that it should not be used as an example for banknote issuance reserves. Banks and companies handling savings, with the start of the new year, are due to pay the savings guarantee reserve fund. A small number of banks and silver companies have already paid according to the new measure. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has also decided to send personnel to Shanghai to investigate within a few days, so as to order the savings banks and companies to comply.</p>

<h3>Plea for Relief from the Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee has recently received numerous letters and telegrams from various provinces and counties regarding the unusually severe floods. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Telegram from the Fancheng Flood Relief Committee, Hubei Province: "Fancheng experienced torrential rain on the night of July 6th. On the morning of the 7th, the Xiang River surged more than several tens of feet. Houses in the city were submerged, and even higher places were sealed off by the flood. Thousands of people drowned. Half of the houses collapsed. Outside the city is a vast expanse of water. The number of deaths is countless. The tragic scene cannot be described by any painful words in the dictionary. As of the morning of the 10th, the floodwaters had receded slightly. The entire city is filled with wailing, the sound of crying even more terrible than before. Those who have died cannot be buried, and those who are alive, whether rich or poor, are all crying for food. Local authorities and gentry from all factions, dressed in short clothes and barefoot, have gathered to form a temporary flood relief committee to provide temporary relief to the disaster victims. However, this flood is so fierce that goods and food have been washed away. The disaster victims are on the verge of death, eagerly awaiting relief. In addition, Fancheng has experienced commercial collapse in recent years. Facing this great disaster, how can people survive? We hereby urgently appeal for relief. Your great kindness will be eternally remembered." (2) Telegram from the Xiangyang Temporary Relief Committee: "After the third day, Xiangyang experienced continuous torrential rain, and the Han River surged sharply. The entire county has been submerged. The number of people drowned and displaced is countless. We are currently trying to provide relief, but after the flood, there are injured and sick people everywhere, and the outbreak of epidemics is unavoidable. At this time, the survivors are suffering and have no good medicine for treatment. We hereby urgently request the rapid provision of medicine for rescue. We are anxiously awaiting orders." (3) Letter from Father Li, Catholic Church in Dongming, Hebei: "The victims of floods within the dikes of Dongming and Changyuan counties have been extremely impoverished for several years. Unexpectedly, this spring's drought caused a complete crop failure. Recently, continuous rain has opened the heavens, and the entire dike has become a swamp. All food and belongings have been washed away. The people have all become wailing refugees, a heartbreaking sight. They urgently need relief. Therefore, on behalf of the people, I beg for assistance."</p>
<p>The China Relief Association recently received a true telegram from the Fancheng Flood Relief Committee in Hubei Province stating: "Fancheng experienced torrential rain on the night of July 6th. On the morning of the 7th, the Xiang River surged more than several tens of feet. Houses in the city were submerged, and even higher places were sealed off by the flood. Thousands of people drowned. Half of the houses collapsed. Outside the city is a vast expanse of water. The number of deaths is countless. The tragic scene is difficult to describe. As of the morning of the 10th, the floodwaters had receded slightly. The entire city is filled with wailing, the sound of crying even more terrible than before. Those who have died cannot be buried, and those who are alive, whether rich or poor, are all crying for food. Local authorities and gentry from all factions, dressed in short clothes and barefoot, have gathered to form a temporary flood relief committee to provide temporary relief. However, this flood is so fierce that the water rose six feet in an hour. People barely had time to escape. Goods and food have all been submerged. This is an unprecedented catastrophe. The disaster victims are on the verge of death, eagerly awaiting relief. In addition, Fancheng has experienced commercial collapse in recent years and is no longer a city. Facing this great hardship, how can people survive? We urgently telegraph our plea for rapid relief." Furthermore, according to a telegram from the Yanshi County Native Association in Bian, "The people of Yanshi are unfortunate and have suffered repeated disasters. For several months, no rain has fallen, and the wheat harvest has been less than 30%. The autumn rice seeds are on barren land. Suddenly, on the 6th of this month, torrential rain caused the Yi and Luo Rivers to overflow more than twenty li. The floodwaters turned everywhere into a swamp. Residents along the city walls were all turned into victims of the waves. The situation within the county seat was especially tragic. Because the city walls are low-lying, the water rose several tens of feet, surging and rushing like water entering an anthill. At that time, the dikes were lost, and there was no time to escape. More than ten thousand lives were floating in the waves. The old and weak drowned instantly, and a small number of the young and strong floated out. The floating corpses are piled up, a heart-wrenching sight. In the deep water, only dangerous buildings remain. Currently, there is still more than ten feet of accumulated water in the city, making it impossible to investigate the casualties and losses in detail. Most heartbreakingly, hundreds of male and female corpses cannot be buried. People weep in despair, a tragic sound to hear. We urgently appeal for rapid relief." Previously, the Association, together with various charitable organizations, handled relief efforts in Liyang, Yixing, and Chun in Jiangsu, spending a large sum of money. Old debts have not been repaid, and new disasters have struck again. The city has been submerged, and the tragic situation can be imagined. The dead are gone, but the living are urgently awaiting rescue. The orphaned survivors are truly unable to survive the day.</p>
<h3>Floods Affect Aviation and Postal Services; China National Aviation Corporation Orders All Stations to Expedite Measures; Full-Line Air Service Expected to Resume Next Week</h3>
<p>The Hankou and Shashi airport stations of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation have been completely submerged due to the surge in the Han River. Aircraft cannot land, so the Ping-Yue (Beijing-Guangdong) air route has been blocked, temporarily stopping at Zhengzhou. All mail, etc., is carried by plane from Ping to Zheng, and then transported by train to Hankou, where it is transferred to China National Aviation Corporation aircraft for forwarding to Guangzhou and other stations. Ticket sales for the Guangzhou and Yuehan stations have been temporarily suspended. The company has telegraphed all stations to expedite measures, and it is expected that full-line air service will resume within the next week.</p>
<h3>Five Representatives of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Travel to Beijing</h3>
<p>Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Mengbai, Yuan Hesong, Tu Kunhua, Sun Choucheng, and others, representatives elected by the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Factory Association, took the express train to Beijing last night. Pharmacies such as the Sino-French Sino-Western Jihua Tang believe that at this time of intense summer heat, the representatives have sacrificed their personal duties for the sake of the industry association, putting the public interest before their own, which is truly admirable. Therefore, in addition to hosting a farewell banquet, they also sent people to the station to express their sincerity. The letter from the association to Director Liu Ruiheng of the National Health Administration is as follows: Last month, the representatives elected by the association visited you and presented everything in person. We were honored to have you agree to make flexible arrangements for the regulations on the management of proprietary Chinese medicines and the regulations on pharmaceutical merchants, and to allow representatives from the association to attend meetings during the revision to present opinions and facilitate consultation. We are deeply grateful for your concern for the difficulties of merchants. We have recently learned that the Administration has decided to hold a general registration for proprietary Chinese medicine registration cases from August 1st to the end of this year, appropriately reducing testing fees, revising the regulations on the management of proprietary Chinese medicines, appropriately relaxing the restrictions on the amount of matching raw material medicines, and agreeing to send personnel to Shanghai to handle the receipt and issuance of instructions and inspection procedures for proprietary Chinese medicines. Therefore, we have publicly elected Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Mengbai, and Tu Kunhua, five committee members, and Secretary-General Sun Choucheng to go to Beijing to receive guidance and earnestly request an audience. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Bus: Prosperous Business and Expanded Routes; Route 4 Expected to Reach Dapu Bridge Directly in Early September; Cross-City Route Difficult to Implement Temporarily Due to Narrow Roads</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai South Public Bus was taken over by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, it has seen prosperous business due to improved management and facilities. Route 4 is expected to reach Dapu Bridge directly in early September. The cross-city route is difficult to implement due to narrow roads. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Business Expansion</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities took over the Shanghai South Public Bus, Director Zhang Dengyi of the Management Office has made great efforts to innovate. All vehicles have been ordered from Daimon-Tian in the United States, with lightweight and beautiful designs. Due to improved management and facilities, the vehicles on each route are fast and efficient. Since the opening, the business has been exceptionally prosperous, with the largest number of passengers and the highest revenue being Route 3, the circular route around the city, followed by Longhua and Pudong, which have slight surpluses every day. The municipal government maintains low fares compared to French and Chinese trams to maintain transportation in the district.</p>
<p>Route 4 Extension</p>
<p>The starting and ending stations of Public Bus Route 4 are designated as Dapu Bridge. Because the Public Works Bureau has not yet completed the paving of the road from Lujiawan along Xie Xu Road to Dapu Bridge, Lujiawan is temporarily designated as the starting and ending point. At the same time, the inbound route is also temporarily designated as Luban Road, Yuanyuan Road, Xieqiao, Dalin Road, Chezhan Road, Guohuo Road, and Hujunying, folding into Li Ma Road. It has been changed to go straight to Li Ma Road via Lujiabang. The outbound route has also been changed to go straight to Lujiawan from Laoximen Xieqiao via Xie Xu Road (parallel to French Route 6 tram). The Public Works Bureau is actively paving the originally designated Dapu Bridge route, which should be able to be moved there by early September.</p>
<p>Cross-City Difficulty</p>
<p>The fifth route of the Shanghai South Public Bus Management Office runs from Lujiawan via Laoximen along Zhaojia Road, Dadongmen to Shiliupu Xiaodongmen, and then folds into Fangbang Road, a prosperous commercial area. However, the roads on both sides are narrow, making it difficult to pass vehicles, so this route is difficult to implement for the time being.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company Starts Route 19</h3>
<p>To facilitate transportation, the British Public Bus Company has started Route 19. The route combines the original routes of Routes 1 and 9, running from Yuyuan Road, passing Jing'an Temple Road, Zhiliwai Baidu Bridge, folding into Broadway Road, and going to the Yangshupu Power Plant.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiaochu and Others Organize the National Goods World</h3>
<p>Xu Xiaochu, Liu Zhongying, Zhang Yizhai, Cao Zhigong, Ge Futian, Xu Kaixian, and others, in view of the urgent need to promote national goods and prevent economic leakage, have initiated the organization of the National Goods World. They have already surveyed the original site of the New World on Nanjing Road in the Shanghai International Settlement as the venue and scheduled the opening for August 1st. They are actively arranging and elaborating decorations these days. It is planned to divide the first and second floors into more than one hundred squares to attract major national goods factories from this city and other places to participate in the display and sale. The third floor will add a recreation department to perform noble recreational activities to help guests enjoy themselves. The small park in the World is a great place to cool off on summer nights and will open at the same time as the commercial venue. It is heard that notices have been sent to national goods factories in this city and other places, encouraging them to participate and register. The registration office is located in the office on the second floor of the World.</p>
<h3>Baseless Rumor: Lin Jing Marries a Beautiful Woman</h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that, according to a Reuters dispatch from Columbus yesterday, the news that Lin Jing, son of Lin Sen, Chairman of the Chinese National Government, is about to marry Ms. Brown, an American woman, has caused a stir in diplomatic circles in both China and the United States, serving as a topic of conversation. A reporter from the Daily News specially visited a relative of Lin to inquire about the truth. According to him, this rumor is an attempt by busybodies to create buzz and confuse listeners, and is definitely not true.</p>

<h3>High Tide in the Huangpu River Before Dawn Tomorrow; If There Are No Typhoons or Low Air Pressure, the Tide Will Not Overflow the Riverbank</h3>
<p>The high tide in the Huangpu River before dawn on the 19th of this month will be one of the highest days in the past seven months of this year. According to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau's prediction, the amount of water will reach 11 feet 7 inches, which is close to the 13-foot riverbank of the Bund. Considering the situation last year where the low-lying roads in this city were often flooded by backflow from sewers, attention should be paid. A reporter from Datong News Agency personally visited Mr. Xue Zhuobin, Chief Engineer of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, and the following is a report:</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Flood Is Not Related to the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Datong News reporter first asked Mr. Xue whether the tide in the Huangpu River seemed to be the highest on the morning of the 19th of this month in the past seven months. Considering that the Yangtze River flood is also rampant at this time, will it exceed the predicted water level and cause the riverbank to overflow? Mr. Xue replied that if there is no hurricane, it will not exceed the predicted water level. As for the Yangtze River flood, because this city is adjacent to the coast, unless there is a long period of northeast wind blowing, it will not be related.</p>
<p>A High Tide Is Predicted for September</p>
<p>The reporter also asked whether there will be a day when the amount of tide in the Huangpu River during the autumn flood season this year will exceed the high tide on the 19th of this month. Mr. Xue replied that generally, the Huangpu River will have a higher tide around the 14th and 15th of September this year. As for the exact amount, the Bureau has not yet measured it at this time. (Mr. Xue also stated that the excess amount is only a few inches). Mr. Xue continued to answer the reporter's question about the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Wind Direction and Air Pressure Are Related</p>
<p>Tides sometimes rise unexpectedly, mainly due to the impact of hurricanes. At the same time, extremely low air pressure also has a considerable relationship. However, the chances of a typhoon blowing through Shanghai are generally higher in August and September of the lunar calendar, and less likely in June and July.</p>
<p>Amount of High Tide Before Dawn Tomorrow</p>
<p>The amount of the high tide in the Huangpu River is 11 feet 7 inches, which is 1 foot 3 inches from the 13-foot riverbank of the Bund (10 inches per foot). The high tide will start to rise from midnight on the 18th and will generally recede completely by noon on the 19th. However, between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. on the morning of the 19th, the rising tide will be rapid, and sailors must pay attention.</p>
<h3>Clear Sky at Dawn Yesterday; Loud Thunder Heard; Two Loud Thunderclaps Five Minutes Apart; Thunder Out of a Clear Sky Is Unprecedented This Year</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been hot for days, especially the day before yesterday, which was the most sultry. As a result, the number of patients in various infectious disease hospitals has increased sharply, and there are many cases of heatstroke. Yesterday morning at about 4 a.m. before dawn, two thunderclaps were heard suddenly, about five minutes apart, with extremely loud sounds, which were frightening to hear. At that time, the morning light was faint, and the sky was clear, without a trace of cloud. This type of thunder out of a clear sky is unprecedented in the summer of this year.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Foreign Rice Imported This Year Is Staggering; It Ranks First Among Imported Goods; Nearly 40 Million Yuan Imported Into This City in the First Half of the Year; Imports Decreased in June, Valued at More Than 4 Million</h3>
<p>The import of foreign rice this year has broken the records of recent years, with a huge amount. The total amount of foreign rice imported into this city in the first half of the year reached more than 38 million yuan in national currency, which is quite staggering. It ranks first among imported goods. The import of foreign rice in June was less, ranking fourth, valued at more than 4 million yuan. The following are the details obtained by the reporter from the Shen Times News Agency:</p>
<p>Huge Amount of Imports</p>
<p>According to statistics from the customs, the total amount of foreign rice imported into this city in the first half of this year was 5,375,690 metric tons, valued at 21,702,149 customs gold units, equivalent to 38,137,142 yuan in national currency, accounting for the first place in imported foreign goods. Annam accounted for the first place, with a total of 3,583,401 metric tons, valued at 14,433,329 customs gold units. India ranked second, with 892,638 metric tons, valued at 3,961,176 customs gold units. Siam ranked third, with 892,977 metric tons, valued at 3,278,642 customs gold units. Japan had 2,432 metric tons, valued at 10,913 customs gold units. Hong Kong had 242 metric tons, valued at 1,179 customs gold units.</p>
<p>Amount Imported in June</p>
<p>The import of foreign rice into this city in June decreased compared to before, with a total of 619,080 metric tons, valued at 2,420,114 customs gold units, equivalent to 4,019,809 yuan in national currency, accounting for the fourth place in imported goods in June. Among them, Annam rice was imported at 41,699 metric tons, valued at 1,558,439 customs gold units. India rice was imported at 115,051 metric tons, valued at 552,193 customs gold units. Siamese rice was imported at 93,329 metric tons, valued at 309,476 customs gold units. In addition, Hong Kong had 1 metric ton, valued at 6.2 customs gold units.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Tung Oil Exports Are Booming; They Have Risen to the First Place in Foreign Trade This Year; If Oil Merchants Can Realize the Situation, the Future Is Still Bright</h3>
<p>Tung oil is an important export commodity of our country. The annual exports to foreign countries were 818,874 dan in 1931, 802,768 dan in 1932, 1,246,847 dan in 1933, and 652,836 dan in 1934. Even in the midst of the decline in foreign trade this year, exports have increased dramatically. According to the customs announcement yesterday, the export of oils in the past six months of this year reached 4,321,041 dan, of which tung oil accounted for the majority, surprisingly rising to the first place among exported goods. Even compared with previous years, the increase is extremely large, which is still a good phenomenon in the midst of the decline in foreign trade. As a result, market prices have soared, and tung oil merchants have mostly tripled their profits. However, in recent years, domestic sales have plummeted, and the number of sales is limited, which cannot control the market. Therefore, the future prosperity or decline of the industry will completely depend on the prosperity or decline of foreign sales by foreign companies. According to news from the tung oil industry, the demand from the United States, the major customer of tung oil, is increasing. Therefore, if tung oil merchants can thoroughly realize the situation, avoid adulterating the oil and improve the quality, they will not repeat the mistakes of silk and tea.</p>
<h3>News of Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>La Dou Road, Dunhe Lane</p>
<p>La Dou Road in the French Concession is located in a remote area. Although there are a few shops, the market has always been bleak. Since the January 28th Incident, it has become even more desolate. The 19 households in Dunhe Lane, including Lihua Company, Huixing, Yongqing, Huang Sanji, Nanchang Yangxingfa, Yongfayuan, and Dayuan, united to form the Dunhe Lane Branch, joining the Eighth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation because the rent was too expensive and unbearable. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., a preparatory meeting was held, and Nanchang Jin Tifang was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and Zhou Fusu was the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the significance of organizing the branch and the purpose of the meeting, emphasizing that rent reduction was urgently needed. His words were pertinent, and all the tenants were moved. It was then decided to proceed with the following measures: (1) Send a letter to the landlord, Zikang Qianzhuang, and the renting agency, Taylor &amp; Co., requesting that they consider the bleak market conditions and the depressed business, especially in the Dunhe Lane section of La Dou Road, where business is sparse during the day and completely deserted at night, and request that they actually collect 70% of the original rent from this month, reducing it by 30%, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. (2) All tenants in Dunhe Lane, in addition to the current tenants, should join to strengthen the solidarity. (3) The Dunhe Lane Branch should be organized and reported to the Second Special District Citizens' Federation for registration and guidance. (4) Dayuan, Yongfayuan, Huang Sanji, and Nanchang Zeng Jinchun were designated as representatives to handle the affairs of the branch. (5) Lawyer Wang Peiyuan was hired as a legal advisor. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Gan Si Dong Road, Shencheng Lane</p>
<p>The tenants of Shencheng Lane on Gan Si Dong Road and Xi Ai Xian Si Road in the French Concession previously organized the Shencheng Lane Assembly because the rent was too expensive and they could not afford it. They sent a letter to the renting agency of the landlord, Lawyer Qiu Fenling, requesting a 30% reduction in rent and the implementation of 70% rent collection, and reported it to the Municipal Federation for registration. It is now known that the Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District has approved the branch and allowed it to be registered. The branch is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 3 p.m. today, and the legal advisor, Wang Peiyuan, will also attend to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Zhabei Baoxing Lane</p>
<p>The tenants of Baoxing Lane in Zhabei held an emergency meeting last night at 8 p.m. The executive committee members present were Hu Jianbo, Zhu Peizhi, Wang Yitang, Wang Hongqing, Fan Zengquan, Lu Fen, Shi Bosheng, Cao Runzhang, Wu Fudi, and Min Xie. Matters discussed: (1) The tenants of this association have been repeatedly oppressed, arrested, and meetings sealed, arousing public outrage. The Municipal Rent Reduction Association is responsible for negotiating with the Public Security Bureau and the landlord, and the Municipal Association has sent Commissioner Jiu Feng to persuade them to resume business and await good news to avoid further losses. Business should resume unanimously on the afternoon of the 13th, and each store should be notified to issue a list of losses for statistics and negotiate compensation with the landlord. (2) Two types of leaflets have been received in the past two days, signed by the Sixth Team of the Zhabei District Defense Corps of the North Shanghai District, the Fourth Section Fire Brigade of Zhabei, and the 25th District Branch of the Citizens' Association. The wording is biased, stating that the tenants' association was sealed by the Public Security Bureau, leading to fights and strikes, which is inappropriate. This association is a local public organization and should pay attention to public security relations. The tenants of this lane have not engaged in any fights. The public organization clearly has other motives and how to negotiate should be discussed. It was decided that the leaflets were not stamped and should be ignored. Another type of leaflet was signed by the Sixth Team of the Zhabei District Defense Corps of the North Shanghai District, the Fourth Section Fire Brigade of Zhabei, and the 25th District Branch of the Citizens' Association, and the Twelfth Section of the Sixth District, advising all stores in the city to open for business now to maintain the city's appearance. How to thank them should be discussed. It was decided that all stores in the lane had already accepted the advice of the Municipal Rent Reduction Association and resumed business as early as the 13th, so there was no need to discuss it further. (3) According to Executive Committee Member Le Junbao's report, he was forcibly pulled to a meeting of the Fourth Section Fire Brigade of Zhabei by the landlord Ding Liansun last night. Because he was forced, he went in his private capacity. When he arrived, he saw tenants Wang Yujun and Chen Zipei in attendance. Le said that he did not inform the tenants in advance, and the tenants' association before the January 28th Incident was destroyed by traitors bribed by the landlord. Past events serve as a lesson, and precautions must be taken.</p>
<h3>Cheng Linsheng, et al., Accused Case Rescheduled for Trial: Plaintiff Recounts Three Instances of Owing Over 60,000 Yuan Without Repayment</h3>
<p>The Gen Taihe Coarse Noodle Factory and Rongxingkang Coal Company have had business dealings involving goods and payments. Around April of this year, the factory leased its business rights to a Mr. Hu, who added the "Yi Ji" mark. After taking over the business, they failed to repay the debts owed to Rongxingkang. Xu Yi, the owner of Rongxingkang who now works as a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against the person in charge of the Gen Tai factory. The court has held hearings several times, but no verdict has been reached. Subsequently, Xu Yi's younger brother, Xu Yiming, also filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special Court, accusing the Gen Tai factory owner Cheng Linsheng, his nephew Cheng Yize, and manager Li Quanhuan of forgery and other offenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang held a hearing to examine the case. The plaintiff, Xu Yi, recounted three instances of the defendants forging documents, defrauding money, and damaging creditors' rights. He stated that Gen Tai owed Rongxingkang over 60,000 yuan in goods payments and bounced checks. When the factory registered with the Northern Government in previous years, Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize were not the signatories; instead, a fabricated name was used. Since the two Chengs did not claim to be shareholders, there was a risk of Rongxingkang suffering losses. When they demanded the owed payments, the defendants would always say that the factory owner was a large landowner but had suffered losses in the gold business and would repay the debt after mortgaging the land. This was actually a means of defrauding money. Regarding the damage to creditors' rights, when the plaintiff's relative, Zhao Pei, requested to seal up the Gen Tai factory, the defendants suddenly privately sold the factory to Yi Ji and others. When questioned, the defendant Li Quanchen stated that the debt owed to Rongxingkang was only over 30,000 yuan, and the factory had other disputes with Xu Yi, which had already been filed in a separate case. Cheng Linsheng admitted to being the owner of the Gen Tai factory, but regarding the dispute over the goods payments with Rongxingkang, he said that the manager should be held responsible, as he did not know much about it and did not know who Zhao Pei was. Cheng Yize firmly claimed that he was not a shareholder of Gen Tai and was unaware of any matters concerning the factory. Judge Yang then adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of July 29th for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Coin Operation on Zhoujiazui Road: Awaiting Set Date for Trial Due to the Complex Nature of the Case and Lengthy Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Police, Feng Zhiming, Liu Zhaokui, and Detective Yan Hanzhang, previously cracked a large-scale counterfeit coin operation at 806 Zhoujiazui Road. They seized 331 finished counterfeit silver dollars, 371 unfinished ones, six silver dollar molds, three silver bars, fifteen pieces of silver alloy, several pounds of yellow and purple copper, and 100 paper dollars. They arrested the suspects Zhang Xueyuan from Jiading, Bao Xuewen from Ningbo, and Zhang Zhiqian, along with ten others, and brought them to the Huishan Police Station. They were sent to the First Special District Court. After investigating and finding that Zhang Zhiqian was not involved in the case, he was released, and the others were returned to custody for further investigation. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The lawyer Wang Yaotang from the Public Works Department stated that further investigation had revealed that the defendants Zhang Xueyuan and Li Yucai were employees of the operation, Bao Xuewen, Yang Agen, Qu Heshang, and Zhu Yuanzhi were responsible for smelting silver and managing the machinery, Hua Haiqing was a tea servant and managed the back door key, and Zhang Shixin was riding a bicycle to the operation to contact Li Baicai about purchasing counterfeit silver dollars when he was arrested. One hundred paper dollars were found in his bicycle basket. Chen Shifu was a cook. The house was rented by Wang Zhaoxiang, who is currently at large, and guaranteed by Xu Wensheng, the owner of Hong Taiyuan Foreign Goods at 1399 Rue Robert. Xu Wensheng also fled upon hearing the news. There are also two accomplices, Zhang Peikui and Yang Shangzhi, who are at large. The silver used to manufacture the counterfeit silver dollars was purchased from various silver shops by Wang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Peikui. There are many defendants in this case, the circumstances are complex, and the interrogation will take a considerable amount of time. He requested a special court hearing to be scheduled. The defendants Zhang Xueyuan and Bao Xuewen hired lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng to defend them. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants briefly and then ordered them to be returned to custody, with a special hearing date to be set.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Shoe Store Employee, Huan Yin-sen, Awaiting Autopsy; Japanese Doctor Watanabe Handed Over to Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Shoe Store at 436 North Sichuan Road is owned by Chen Zhichang from Guangdong. Huan Yin-sen, a shop employee from Jiangbei, is 20 years old and lives in his hometown. Huan lived in the store. Two months ago, he fell ill with a foot ailment and had not recovered. On the morning of the 16th of this month, around 11:00 AM, he sought treatment from Japanese doctor Watanabe at 166 Zhapu Road. After examining him, the doctor diagnosed Huan with insomnia and other symptoms. He gave him five small packets of powdered medicine and instructed him to swallow them. However, after Huan took the medicine, his colleagues noticed that his condition worsened, and he seemed to be in a coma. They took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died around 3:30 PM that day. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Inspector Zhu Fenghuang, Western Inspector White, and Chinese Detective Bai Mingfu to investigate. They reported to the Japanese Consulate and, in cooperation with the consulate's judicial police, went to the Japanese doctor's clinic to investigate. As the doctor did not have a medical license, he was taken to the Japanese Consulate along with a bottle of medicine and doctor Watanabe for legal processing. Huan's body was sent to the Fei Lun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue. After the detectives explained the situation and stated that there was a packet of medicine available for chemical analysis, they requested an autopsy to determine the truth. Tang questioned the witness Liang Jinfang briefly and then approved the autopsy of Huan Yin-sen's body, with a decision to be made at a later date.</p>

<h3>After Overseas Chinese Lin Yuting Died, Concubine Sues Main Wife and Son, Claiming Abuse and Unbearable Cohabitation; Requests the Court to Divide the Estate</h3>
<p>After the deceased overseas Chinese Lin Yuting died of illness on July 19th of last year, his estate of several hundred thousand was entirely managed by his legal wife and son, Lin Ruobo. Now, Lin Yuting's concubine, Lin Jiangshan, has hired lawyer Song Yan to petition the local court to divide the estate, claiming that she was abused by the main wife and son after her husband's death and could not bear to live with them. After receiving the petition, the court, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, held a special hearing in the 14th courtroom presided over by Judge He Jingxian. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. First, Jiangshan Song testified that she was 28 years old. (Question) When Lin Yuting was alive, did you live with the main wife? (Answer) Yes, we lived together. (Question) After Lin Yuting died, did you continue to live together? (Answer) Yes, we lived together. (Question) How much property did Lin Yuting have in total? (Answer) He told me before he died that there were houses and land in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. I heard that there were also many business partnerships in the United States, but I haven't investigated them clearly. (Question) Are you still living with Lin Ruobo and others? (Answer) Because I was abused, I moved out and live in the front building of an ordinary city house. (Question) How much are your monthly living expenses? (Answer) About 60 yuan is enough. Next, Lin Ruobo testified that he was 24 years old, from Guangdong, and lived on Route Ghisi Fei Ai in Shanghai. My father died, and there is no inventory of all the property he left behind. (Question) How much property did your father leave behind after his death? (Answer) Real estate in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, worth a total of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. (Question) How much money is in the Shanghai Bank? (Answer) 8,300 yuan. (Question) Is there anything else? (Answer) No. (Question) Who is Lin Jiangshan to your family?

There are 35 city houses there, each costing 1,300 yuan to build. The land was purchased for over 30,000 yuan. There is also a piece of land on Zhongshan Road in Nanjing. I did not handle the property in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, so I don't know the actual amounts. After hearing the testimony, the judge stated that this case required further investigation and adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Egg Fried Rice Mixed with Flies: Gangsters Intentionally Trouble Restaurant, Gathering Gang and Destroying the Shop with Weapons</h3>
<p>In the French Concession, around North Chejiaqiao on Route Tenant de Viliers, there have recently been hoodlums and gangsters who are entrenched in small teahouses and inns, specializing in extracting money from people. Some time ago, Huang Shanfa and a person named A Jin were fighting over the right to set up watermelon stalls at the intersection of the bridge on Caishi Street. The two parties agreed to meet at the Xiafei Teahouse at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Rollock at 11:00 AM to have the issue arbitrated. The two sides scuffled, and a Chinese constable No. 379 stepped forward to stop them and was beaten by the gang, tearing his uniform. As a result, Huang Shanfa was arrested and sent to the court for trial. The gang was responsible for the melee at the scene. As a result, the shops in the area are all afraid of them, avoiding them like snakes. Recently, a gangster from the gang named Chang Fukang, nicknamed "Turtle Little Boss," has been selling red pills and gathering a gang in front of the Jin Yuan Guan Dim Sum Shop (owned by Hu Jinlin, a 24-year-old Fujianese) at the entrance of Jin Yu Li, North Chejiaqiao on Route Tenant de Viliers. Whenever they saw the police patrolling, they would hide in the Jin Yuan Guan to avoid the eyes and ears of the police. The owner of the shop, Hu Jinlin, was afraid that he would be implicated if the police found out, so he prevented them from hiding in the shop in the future to avoid trouble. However, Chang harbored a grudge because of this. Around 3:00 PM on the 16th, Chang, along with his companions Wang Heshang and Zhu Fugen (nicknamed "Little Fugen"), went to the Jin Yuan Guan Dim Sum Shop and ordered three bowls of egg fried rice. The three of them started eating at the table. When they were about halfway through, Chang and others took out twenty or thirty flies that they had pre-killed and secretly mixed them into the bowls of egg fried rice. They immediately claimed that the food in the shop was not clean and concerned hygiene. They looked for the shop owner, Hu Jinlin, to argue with, but he was not there. They grabbed the shop's chef, Zhang Abao (22-year-old from Wusong), and beat Zhang's ears twenty or thirty times without asking why. After people persuaded them to stop, Chang and others left in anger. Still unwilling, a moment later, they gathered twenty or thirty gangsters, each holding weapons, iron and wooden sticks, and rushed to the Jin Yuan Guan. Without asking why, they destroyed all the stoves, bowls, and other items in the shop, causing a loss of about 100 yuan. The gang celebrated their victory and dispersed happily. Afterwards, the shop owner provided a detailed bill and reported to the French Police Department, requesting an investigation. Towards evening, Constable Xue Youlin arrested the accomplice Zhu Fugen (also known as Little Fugen, 28 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 18 Dexing Li, West Xinjiao Street) at the entrance of Taiyuan Fang, Xizilaihuo Street on Caishi Street. The other perpetrators had already fled. Zhu was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Dong Qiming of the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court interrogated him. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, stating that the defendant was arrested for intimidation and destruction, and the police department still needed to investigate the case and arrest the fugitives, requesting a postponement of the trial. Then, the plaintiff, Hu Jinlin, stated the situation. After the court verified the report and questioned the defendant, it ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and approved a seven-day postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association Submits Another Petition to the Taxpayers' Association Yesterday; Wang Xiaolai Promises to Forward to the Police Department for Release of Confiscated Vehicles</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council announced that it would increase rickshaw taxes starting in the fall, rickshaw owners have strongly opposed it due to the increased burden and difficulty in making a living. They have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association, contacting rickshaw colleagues to jointly oppose it. They have repeatedly sent letters to various industry associations in the city to appeal and have sent representatives to the Municipal Council, Chinese Directors, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concession to petition. The Municipal Council's Chinese Director He De-kui and Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing accepted the requests, advising them to work peacefully and wait for a solution. They also assured them that old passes would be valid until a solution was reached. The Public Concession Police in various jurisdictions, without prior notification from the Municipal Council, suddenly began confiscating vehicles in their respective jurisdictions yesterday (the Hongkou Police Department confiscated seven rickshaws in the Kunshan Road and Wusong Road area, and the Central Police Department and the Shanhai Pass Road and Xinza Road Police Departments each confiscated one rickshaw), causing panic among rickshaw owners. Many went to the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association, requesting assistance to release the vehicles. From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM yesterday, as many as eighty or ninety people arrived, some with their families, causing disorder and panic. Due to the hot weather, the association feared that accidents would occur, so committee members Shen Yong, Cheng Zhongdao, Gao Youyu, and others led thirty representatives of rickshaw pullers to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to petition again. Chairman Wang Xiaolai received them, promising to inform the Municipal Council and forward the request to the police department for release. The atmosphere then calmed down. It is said that if the police deliberately make things difficult and do not release the vehicles, the association has decided to launch a larger-scale petition to the Municipal Council today.

<h3>Preliminary Review of City Song Nearing Completion; Announcement Possible Before the 15th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government solicited submissions for a city song and received hundreds of submissions by the end of June. These submissions have been handed over to the Second Section for preliminary review. It is understood that the submissions are currently being reviewed in conjunction with music experts. Due to the large number of submissions and the importance of the matter, it must be done carefully, so progress is slow. It is estimated that about fifty submissions have been reviewed so far, and the remaining submissions should be completed by the end of this month. They will then be handed over to Secretary-General Yu, Education Bureau Director Pan, and Committee Member Lu of the Municipal Party Department for a second review. It is expected that the official announcement can be made before the 15th of next month.</p>

<p>Lin Shaoheng, a native of Fujian and 47 years old, previously served as a secretary in the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. After leaving his position on May 18th, he resided at No. 74, Dahua Apartment, No. 431 Rue Pèlerin (Datiebang) in the French Concession, for nearly two months. He sought employment everywhere, but was never persistent. He was also addicted to gambling, which led to financial difficulties. With a large family to support, he felt a heavy burden and became despondent. On the evening of the 16th of this month, he committed suicide in the apartment by taking sleeping pills, "Fumian Pills," and raw opium.

The apartment reported to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for examination. Today, the Second Special District Court will be requested to send personnel for examination. According to the deceased's resume note, his brother was notified, who then notified the deceased's son, Lin Yingfeng (19 years old, working as a draftsman at the Jiangnan Shipyard), who came to the morgue to identify the body. The deceased's resume is recorded below: Lin Shaoheng, from Minhou, Fujian, 47 years old, graduated from the former Imperial University.

<h3>Leprosy Relief Association Holds Second Board Meeting Yesterday to Prepare for the Second National Leprosy Conference</h3>
<p>The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held its second board meeting of the year at 5:30 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Trust Company conference room. Ding Fubao, Lai Douyan, Li Yuanxin, Cheng Lian, Hu Guigeng, Zhu Shaoping, Yan Feiwen, Yu Zhijian, and others were present. Chairman Yan Fuqing was absent due to other business and was temporarily replaced by Li Wuxin. The most important items on the agenda were: 1. The issue of the Second National Leprosy Conference. The conference is scheduled to be held in Guangzhou from November 8th to 9th of this year. Yan Fuqing, Mai Yagu, Luo Aisi, Lai Douyan, Chen Hongkang, and Ying Yuanyue were immediately appointed to begin preparations. 2. The equipment issue of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium.

Except for the Hu Wenhu Memorial Sanatorium and the auditorium, other buildings are largely completed, and all arrangements are expected to be completed by the end of August. The board of directors then appointed Mai Yagu, Bartson, Lai Douyan, and Yu Zhijian as equipment committee members to jointly study and strive for the latest equipment under the principle of economy. The association also decided to discontinue the Hongkou Skin Clinic at the end of next month, and its capable staff will be transferred to the new sanatorium. The association is also in detailed discussions with Renji, Tongren, and Red Cross hospitals, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Bureau, to set up leprosy clinics and coordinate with each other to facilitate the treatment of mild cases and examine new cases, serving as an assistant to the leprosy sanatorium.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Cracks Down on Substandard Food and Drink</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau believes that every summer, street vendors and vegetable stalls often cut open and sell melons and vegetables without adding gauze covers, or even sprinkle raw water, and arbitrarily discard melon rinds, attracting flies. There are also those who sell soda, sour plum soup, ice cream, and other items, mixing raw water, saccharin, or toxic colorings and flavorings. This not only harms the health of individual diners, but also serves as a medium for spreading infectious diseases. Now that it is summer, if strict crackdowns are not carried out, it will be extremely harmful to public health. The bureau has instructed its subordinates to crack down on these activities at any time and has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing all police officers to pay attention to crackdowns at any time in accordance with the regulations. It is reported that those who sell cut-open melons and fruits without using gauze covers, sprinkle raw water, arbitrarily discard melon and fruit residues, manufacture ice cream, use crushed ice mixed in it, or have deteriorated quality, use saccharin, and contain toxic colorings and flavorings will be fined up to 15 yuan in accordance with the regulations, and unsanitary items will be destroyed immediately. Repeat offenders will be fined and their businesses will be suspended. Furthermore, those who manufacture or sell unsanitary food and drink in the urban area will have all such items confiscated and destroyed, and may be fined up to 20 yuan. Those who violate criminal law should be sent to court for punishment.</p>
<h3>China Salvage Company Begins Salvaging the Maoli Xinlun; Continues to Send Laborers to Assist in Salvaging Goods</h3>

<h3>This Afternoon: Zheng Zhengqiu's Funeral; Over Ten Organizations Hold Public Memorial Service; Condolence Messages Pour in from All Sides</h3>
<p>Our nation's pioneering film director and assistant manager of the Star Film Company, Zheng Zhengqiu, unfortunately passed away suddenly from heart failure at 7:00 AM on the 16th. The shocking news caused widespread mourning. Upon hearing the news the day before yesterday, people from all walks of life flocked to the Shanghai Funeral Home east of Maple Bridge to pay their respects, lamenting with sighs. Mr. Zheng was a renowned figure in the art world, dedicating his life to film art and making significant contributions to the cultural sphere. He was also passionate about social endeavors, actively participating in public affairs and sparing no effort.</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service to Be Held Today</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's remains are scheduled for a grand funeral examination at the Shanghai Funeral Home this afternoon (the 18th). Over ten organizations, including the Star Film Company, the Guangzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, the Chaozhou Guild Hall, the Chaozhou Heji Hospital, the Jushenghe Sports Association, the Xiayi Society, the Zhiguang Society, the Qun'an Sports Association, the Qun'an Free School, and the Mingde Charity Hall, will hold a public memorial service to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaojian Sculpts a Face Mold</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited the Shanghai Funeral Home to pay respects to Mr. Zheng's remains. The renowned sculptor Jiang Xiaojian, along with cartoonists Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan, were using plaster to create a concave face mold of Mr. Zheng. The process took twenty minutes to complete. This concave mold will be used to replicate Mr. Zheng's face for commemorative purposes. It is reported that Mr. Jiang Xiaojian had just returned to Shanghai from Changsha and Hankou in Hunan province yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Zheng's Mother Discusses His Background</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's mother, Madam Zhang, was also sitting silently in the mourning hall, her expression grief-stricken and overwhelmed by sorrow. Madam Zheng spoke to the reporter about Mr. Zheng's background, saying that Zheng's ancestors were all wealthy merchants. However, Zheng's father entered the bureaucracy, serving as the magistrate of Sansui and other positions. Zheng Zhengqiu also entered officialdom in his early years, once serving as a probationary magistrate in Hubei during Zhang Zhidong's time. However, due to the decline of honest government and his innate love for art, he pursued a career in writing, eventually dedicating himself to the stage and screen, leading to his accomplishments today. Madam Zheng also stated that Zheng Zhengqiu was her biological son, born at 8:00 AM on the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month of the fourteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor. Unfortunately, he was born weak and prone to illness, so he was traditionally adopted to ensure the continuation of the family line and longevity. Reports stating that he was an adopted son are a misunderstanding. It is also reported that the Zheng family estate at Damatou in the Nanshi district of this city has recently been divided among the branches. Zheng Zhengqiu was discussing with Mr. Zhang Shiyong the possibility of organizing a national goods market to revitalize commerce in Nanshi, but this has now become an unfulfilled wish of Mr. Zheng's.</p>
<p>Condolence Messages Pour in from All Sides</p>
<p>Since the news of Mr. Zheng's passing spread, condolence messages have been pouring in from all sides. Here are a few excerpts: The China Educational Film Association cabled: "To Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu at the Star Film Company, Maple Bridge: We are deeply saddened to hear of your father's passing. Your father guided the progress of our country's drama and film industry more than anyone else. The loss of this mentor is a loss to society, not just the artistic community. We send our condolences to express our sorrow." The Central Film Enterprise Guidance Committee cabled: "To the Star Film Company, Maple Bridge: We were shocked to hear of the passing of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu. The Chinese film industry has suddenly lost a mentor, and we share your grief. Fortunately, Mr. Zheng's legacy will endure, and we rely on you all to continue to advance his aspirations.

The loss of this star has deprived the film world of a mentor, and we are deeply saddened. We send our condolences and hope you will take comfort in your grief." (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Mr. Hu Yongqi, the general manager of the Ning Shao Life Insurance Company and a standing committee member of the Insurance Industry Association, believes that the insurance business is essential for safeguarding individual and family happiness and for the revival and prosperity of industry and commerce. Observing the development of the insurance business in Europe and America, he notes that it is due to the public's awareness of the benefits of insurance, leading them to purchase policies. In many foreign countries, insurance courses have been incorporated into elementary school textbooks, so the effectiveness of insurance has been deeply ingrained in the minds of children. However, textbooks published in our country do not include insurance courses, which hinders the promotion and full utilization of insurance benefits. Mr. Hu recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association, requesting that the association consult with the Postal Savings Life Insurance Department and submit a petition to the Ministry of Education to incorporate insurance knowledge into elementary school textbooks, hoping that the Chinese public will recognize the benefits of insurance. It is also reported that several universities in Shanghai, such as Fudan and Shanghai University, have followed Mr. Hu's request and included insurance as a required course in their business schools.</p>
<h3>Grave Robbing Rampant Again in Chongde; Shanghai-Based Gentry Petition for Strict Investigation and Prosecution</h3>
<p>Since April of this year, multiple cases of grave robbing and coffin desecration have occurred in Shangsi Experimental Township in the first district of Chongde County. The township convened a temporary implementation committee to discuss investigation and prevention measures, requesting the county government to dispatch patrol boats to patrol the waterways and recruiting eight local strongmen to patrol the land day and night. They also secretly reported the names of several well-known grave robbers to the county government, requesting that they be arrested and prosecuted by name. After these strict precautions were taken, grave robbing disappeared for several months. Recently, however, gambling has become prevalent in the nearby Sihongtou area, attracting unscrupulous people. Within a few days, grave robbing resurfaced. The ancestral grave of the township head of the experimental township was the first to be desecrated. The graves of the Zhong and Sheng families were also affected, causing widespread panic and fear. Since the township is an experimental township, it places more emphasis on key policies such as the Baojia system than other townships. Currently, gentry in Shanghai, such as Sheng Linshu, have submitted a petition to Luo Zhongda, the magistrate of Chongde County, requesting an on-site inspection and a swift and strict investigation and prosecution to deter illegal activities and reassure the people.</p>

<h3>Maid Commits Suicide in Actress Liu Yunfang's Home, Dies in Hospital</h3>
<p>Bai Li, a wet nurse from Beijing working for the Jingju actress Liu Yunfang, wanted to return to her hometown last month due to water and soil incompatibility. Liu Yunfang and her husband persuaded her to stay until the autumn. She agreed to stay temporarily and try to wean the child. However, her family sent a letter urging her to return. She was unable to wean the child immediately and seemed dissatisfied with her family, so she suddenly had the idea of suicide. The details were published in this newspaper yesterday. It is now reported that after she was sent to Guangren Hospital, she was still conscious at the time. Police detectives questioned her about the reason for her suicide. Bai Li stated that it was due to family problems and had nothing to do with the Liu family. However, due to severe injuries, she died at around 7:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Savior of Stomach and Intestinal Diseases: Stomine is Most Effective</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the mortality rate in the Shanghai International Settlement in June of this year was lower than in the same month last year. Various respiratory infectious diseases, except whooping cough, have decreased. However, gastrointestinal diseases are gradually increasing. According to Dr. Jordan, the increase in these diseases is normal with the arrival of summer. "Stomine" tablets, a German stomach and intestinal tonic and nutrient, are rich in a variety of nutrients that immediately transform into new energy, spreading throughout the body, and stimulating the digestive system's secretory function and peristalsis. Introduced by famous doctors from various countries, it is considered the most effective and reliable tablet for treating hyperacidity, liver and stomach pain, acute and chronic gastroenteritis, acid reflux, chest tightness, indigestion, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, dysentery, anemia, post-illness weakness, malnutrition, mental fatigue, beriberi, and other conditions. It is a must-have medicine for the summer. It is sold in major pharmacies in the city and elsewhere. The main wholesalers are Shanghai Jihuatang, Wuzhou, Zhongxi, Huamei, Zhongfa, Dalu, Jicheng, Kefa, Taihe, and Zhengwei pharmacies.</p>
<h3>Dr. Wang Tiecheng's Enthusiasm for Education: Teaching English for Free Without Tuition</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Tiecheng, the principal of the Continental English School on Laobazi Road, has written the book "Spoken English in the Air" based on his experience of more than ten years of teaching and his frequent conversations with Westerners. This book enables those who are interested in learning English to speak common and applied English. For the purpose of popularizing the language, he is teaching through the Buddhist Radio Station. Mr. Enpei, an American, is hired to teach pronunciation, and Ms. Shao Yunqing is translating. The pronunciation is clear, accurate, and fluent. Each lesson is broadcast from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 8:15 PM to 9:00 PM, and the lessons are conducted during a full hour without any advertising. This allows young students to learn everyday English during the summer vacation, and businessmen can learn in their spare time without leaving their homes. To facilitate the purchase of the book, an online purchase service is available. Those who wish to purchase the book can call 44184 or 46933, and someone will be sent to deliver it immediately. Since the broadcasting began on July 10, letters and phone calls requesting purchases have been very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Civil Ship Boatmen's Job Placement Center; Representatives from Various Agencies and Organizations Participate</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held at 147 Min'guo Road, opposite the French Concession Buddhist Republic Road, on the street. Representatives from various agencies came to the site to provide guidance. Huang Yaohua from the Social Bureau, Fang Rusheng from the General Labor Union, Wang Peiting from the Public Security Bureau, Huang Longhua from the textile industry, and Liang Chunlai and Huang Le'an from the shipping industry, among others, about 100 people, participated. Zhang Jin'an chaired the meeting, performing the ceremonies accordingly. The chairman then reported, stating that the Bureau is holding the inaugural meeting in this extremely hot weather, the Bureau is deeply grateful for the guidance of the representatives of the Party and government organs and everyone's presence. When civil ship boatmen who come and go on the sea lose their jobs, it is very difficult to find work. From the shipowner's perspective, employing ship boatmen is also perceived to be insufficient in terms of driving skills and lack of experience. Therefore, both parties have many difficulties. In view of this, the Bureau formed the Shanghai Civil Ship Boatmen's Job Placement Center, striving for progress, in order to make the shipowner and the boatmen walk towards a happy path. Because the comrades in the Bureau feel that their own abilities are limited, we also ask the representatives of the Party and government organs and everyone to provide as much guidance as possible. After the representatives of the Party and government organs and guests made their speeches one after another, the whole body took photographs, had tea and snacks, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>People in the Hangzhou area participated in a swimming event like swimming with candles, with two people from both Zhongqing and Changfeng participating, but both failed due to the strong winds that day. Only Yu Baojian from Changfeng completed the swim. Over twenty people participated in all, and the veteran Yu Rongji from Zhongqing demonstrated his forte, giving the people of Hangzhou many good images. This large group of heroes in the water made Xizi Lake feel sore and swollen until it was over at six o'clock.</p>
<p>Provincial Records All Shattered</p>
<p>At 3 PM on the second afternoon, the Zhongqing and Changfeng teams held a formal friendly match at the Hangzhou High School swimming pool. Gao Shangzhi was the chief referee, Zhu Jiasheng the starter, and Peng Sanmei the recorder. There were hundreds of spectators watching by the pool. The entire program consisted of eight events, and all Zhejiang provincial records were broken. Zhongqing swept seven events. The most unfortunate thing was that Zhongqing failed by one lap in the medley relay, otherwise they could have dominated everything. What is especially valuable is that even though the results were not the best due to the above reasons, the Zhejiang provincial records were still shattered. Without the above reasons, breaking the national record would not be difficult. Although the Changfeng team is a hero of West Lake, they abandoned their armor and weapons and fled upon encountering the Zhongqing team. However, they were still able to defeat Zhongqing in the medley relay and set a new record, which is truly commendable. In the end, Zhongqing scored 45 points and Changfeng scored 20 points. The results of the competition are recorded below, with the top three in each event listed.</p>
<p>50-meter Freestyle: Liang Weisheng (Zhong), Zhang Rongguang (Zhong), Zhou Zhaohua (Chang) 30.4 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>

<h3>International Swimming Competition: Chinese Team Begins Registration; Must First Register with the Sports Association</h3>
<p>The 4th International Swimming Competition was resolved by the International Swimming Committee the day before yesterday. The preliminary competition will be held on the 14th of last month, and the final competition will be held on the 17th. The venue will be the YMCA swimming pool on Jing'an Temple Road. Each country is allowed to send two representatives to participate in each event, and only one representative per country is allowed to participate in the 800-yard freestyle. The registration deadline has been set for 5:00 PM on August 9th. All of this information has been reported in previous issues. Participants in this competition will include the Republic of China, Great Britain, the United States, Japan, and a combined European and American team, among five units. The Japanese team won the championship in the previous competition, so the selection of representatives for the Chinese team in this competition is of great concern to those who care about sports. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited the committee member Chu Xitao yesterday, who said that the selection of representatives for the Chinese team must be reviewed and confirmed by the National Sports Association before registering with the International Swimming Committee. Anyone who believes that their performance is qualified and is confident can register directly with the Sports Association. The association will then hold a selection in early next month to formally determine the representatives of the Chinese team. Registration has begun today, and all of our aquatic heroes can quickly register with the Sports Association and strive to practice hard to wash away the shame.</p>
<h3>Confrontation between the Central Youth and Western Youth Swimming Teams on the 27th of this Month at the Western Youth</h3>
<p>After achieving double victories in their southern expedition to Hangzhou, the Central Youth Swimming Team received a letter from the Western Youth Team, known as the aquatic hegemon of Shanghai, inviting them to a contest. It has now been decided that the fierce battle will take place at the Western Youth pool this month on the 27th (Saturday) at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Central Youth Swimming Team in Hangzhou: Eight Zhejiang Province Records Broken; Aviation Retreats; Evergreen Wind Suffers; Exciting Water Polo Match: Six to Zero</h3>
<p>The Central Youth Swimming Team of the Sichuan Road YMCA, a group of fourteen led by coach Peng Sanmei and team leader Jian Erming, took the early Shanghai-Hangzhou express train last Friday morning to conquer Hangzhou. They returned to Shanghai on the overnight express train this Monday. Coach Peng Sanmei told reporters yesterday that the team's journey to Hangzhou was quite detailed, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>Pool Water Too Hot Affects Performance</p>
<p>Before going to Hangzhou, the team had arranged friendly matches with the Evergreen Wind and Aviation teams. After arriving in Hangzhou, they received a letter from the Aviation team stating that they were busy with flight training and had to cancel the arrangement. Therefore, they switched to a water sports performance with the Evergreen Wind team on Saturday and a formal contest on Sunday. Although all eight Zhejiang Province high records were broken in the contest on the second day, the results did not reach the highest point. (1) Because the weather in Hangzhou was hotter than in Shanghai, the players felt very tired. (2) The pool water was exposed to the scorching sun and almost became boiling water. (3) The pool water had not been changed for a long time, it was turbid and unclear, and the sidelines and bottom lines were not easy to see, which greatly affected the results. The results could have been published immediately after returning to Shanghai, but the team members felt unwell after the strenuous exercise, so the publication was delayed until today.</p>
<p>Evergreen Wind Suffers a Water Polo Shutout</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the first afternoon, the Central Youth and Evergreen Wind teams held a water sports gala in the West Lake swimming pool, with thousands of spectators. The event concluded at 6:00 PM. Zhu Jiasheng, head of the Hangzhou Public Sports Field, served as the announcer. The first item on the program was the Central Youth team's masterpiece, water polo. Because the Evergreen Wind team was short of players, they temporarily pulled in Yu Rongji and Lu Huijie, who defected to the Central Youth. Evergreen Wind was not adequately trained and could not withstand the attack of a well-trained team, especially since the Central Youth team included many water polo experts and Hong Kong inter-port representatives such as Zhang Rongguang, Liang Weisheng, and Jian Erming, whose skills were superb. As a result of the fierce battle, the Central Youth team won a decisive victory of six to zero with a casual attitude. Otherwise, the Evergreen Wind team would have been too embarrassed. The lineup was as follows: (Central Youth) Goalkeeper Jian Erjie, defenders Jian Erming and Zhou Rui, center Yu Rongbang, center forward Liang Weisheng, wingers Zhang Rongguang and Chen Zhijie; (Evergreen Wind) Goalkeeper Yu Dechu, defenders Huang Guangrun and Ling Nanli, center Li Yizhong, center forward Zhou Zhaohua, wingers Yu Rongji and Lu Huijie. Referee Peng Sanmei. The first half was three to zero, the second half was three to zero, resulting in six to zero, Central Youth won.</p>
<p>Spectacular Water Sports Gala</p>
<p>The second program was a fifteen-meter swim with hands and feet tied. Yu Saijian and Li Yingsheng of Evergreen Wind won, with a time of thirty seconds. Next was a two-person foot swim, also at a distance of twenty-five meters. Liang Weisheng and Zhang Rongguang of Central Youth, and Lu Weijie and Jian Erming won, with a time of twenty-five seconds. Then there was candle swimming, with two participants from Central Youth and Evergreen Wind. However, due to the strong wind that day, all failed. Only Yu Baojian of Evergreen Wind swam about twenty meters before the candle was blown out. Finally, more than ten people from both teams participated in fancy diving. As a result, the Central Youth veteran Yu Rongji displayed his masterpiece, giving the people of Hangzhou many good impressions. This group of aquatic heroes caused West Lake to ache and swell their heads until it was over at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Provincial Records Smashed</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the second afternoon, the Central Youth and Evergreen Wind teams held a formal friendly contest at the Hangzhou High School swimming pool. The chief referee was Gao Shangzhi, the starter was Zhu Jia, and the recorder was Peng Sanmei. Hundreds of people watched by the pool. All eight items on the program broke the Zhejiang Province record without exception, and Central Youth monopolized seven of them. The most regrettable thing was that Central Youth failed by a hair in the three-style relay, otherwise they could have looked down on everything. What is especially valuable is that although the results were not the highest point due to the above reasons, they had already smashed the Zhejiang Province record. Without the above reasons, breaking the national record would not have been difficult. Although the Evergreen Wind team is a hero of West Lake, they abandoned their armor and fled when they encountered the Central Youth team. However, they were able to overcome Central Youth in the three-style relay and create a new record, which is truly commendable. As a result of the competition, Central Youth scored forty-five points and Evergreen Wind scored twenty points. The results of the competition are recorded below, with the top three in each item:</p>
<p>Fifty-meter freestyle: Liang Weisheng (Central), Zhang Rongguang (Central), Zhou Zhaohua (Evergreen) 30.4 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>
<p>One-hundred-meter backstroke: Zhou Ruiqin (Central), Jian Erming (Central), Xu Shouqiang (Evergreen) 1 minute 30 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>
<p>One-hundred-meter freestyle: Zhang Rongguang (Central), Xu Shouqiang (Evergreen), Mo Tongzhe (Evergreen) 1 minute 17 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>
<p>One-hundred-meter breaststroke: Jian Erlian (Central), Yu Baojian (Evergreen), Huang Guangrun (Evergreen) 1 minute 29.3 seconds (breaks provincial new record)</p>
<p>Two-hundred-meter breaststroke: Jian Erlian (Central), Yu Baojian (Evergreen), Huang Guangrun (Evergreen) 3 minutes 18.6 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>

<p>One-hundred-fifty-meter three-style relay: Evergreen Wind Team Xu Shouqiang (backstroke), Zhou Zhaohua (breaststroke), Mo Tongzhe (freestyle); Central Youth Team Yu Rongji (backstroke), Jian Erjie (breaststroke), Liang Weisheng (freestyle) 1 minute 57 seconds (provincial new record)</p>
<p>Two-hundred-meter relay: Central Youth Team Shi Bogen, Liang Weisheng, Zhou Ruiqin, Zhang Rongguang; Evergreen Wind Team Mo Tongzhe, Zhou Zhaohua, Ling Nanli, Jin Dechu 2 minutes 16.5 seconds (breaks provincial record)</p>

The Jiaoji team defeated the Longhai team, the Jinpu team defeated the Tangda team, the Banhan team defeated the Xiang'e team, and the Railway Department team defeated the Zhushao team, all with a score of three to zero. The teams felt that the championship had already been decided, and their morale was very relaxed. The heavy rain in the afternoon required postponement. The Beining team scored the most points in the entire team.</p>
<h3>Central Guoshu Institute Cultivates Guoshu Teachers for Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Primary and Secondary Schools to Take Note</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, stating: Based on the letter from the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, the Minister handed down a public letter from the Central Guoshu Institute, which stated: "After investigation, Guoshu has been approved by your Ministry to be a required course in physical education for middle and primary schools. Guoshu is a good method for our nation to strengthen itself. It is sufficient to strengthen the body and the race, and it can even resist insults. Compared with other sports, it is superior. It is a pity that although many schools in the country have this course, many others have not yet set up Guoshu courses, especially girls' schools. The reason is nothing more than the lack of teachers, which makes the required courses like a country that has never been. This Institute, in view of this, has been actively cultivating male and female teachers for many years for schools to hire. This summer, it is estimated that there will be fifteen male students and six female students graduating from the Institute's training class. They are all selected by the Institute for their solid foundations and have come to the Institute for further study. They have studied for three years and passed rigorous examinations. They are extremely suitable for the selection of Guoshu teachers for primary and secondary schools. I am afraid that you will not be fully aware, so I hereby write to your Ministry to check and forward it to your subordinates. If you lack male and female Guoshu teachers, please specify the required level of teachers and the salaries to be paid so that we can select the appropriate candidates. In addition to sending separate letters, I am writing to inform you, hoping that you will check and take the matter to heart." The Minister ordered the Department to inform the Education Departments and Bureaus of the provinces and cities to forward the notice. It is appropriate to order all primary and secondary schools in this city to take note. This order.</p>

However, no matter what, it is not about talking more, but about implementation, and it is especially important for sports.

Mr. Ratwick has a great reputation in the German sports world. This time he comes to China, he may be able to contribute to sports. I wish your meeting a complete success, etc. Next, the German Ratwick delivered a speech. Finally, Principal Liu and others from the Chinese Vocational Education Society spoke one after another. Because Shen had not yet returned to the meeting, the meeting was temporarily adjourned. After arriving at the Science Museum, they took photos behind it. At this time, Mayor Shen and Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaolu Committee, etc., were waiting for the president to return to the hospital. After arriving at the meeting together, they joined in the photography. Chairman Wang Zhengting still asked Mayor Shen to say a few words to the conference. Shen stood up and said that today the three summer training lectures and discussion meetings are opening at the same time. The training session is to train athletes from all over the country in preparation for participating in the World Games to promote national culture. The lectures and discussions are to communicate opinions from all walks of life and study how to improve sports. The three are closely related and indispensable. Qingdao's sports were originally very young. Now that the three conferences are held in Qingdao, it will give sports personnel in this city a good opportunity to participate in practice, which is especially rare. Also, the scenery in the rural areas of this city is very good, and there are also famous scenic spots in Laoshan. When there is time, I plan to invite you to visit and guide you, etc. At 12:30 PM, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Whose Power Is Greater (Contribution)</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>Using domestic goods, whose power is greater? In the past, people did not care about the husband, but the wife: so there was a women's domestic goods year in the east, and a women's domestic goods association in the west. Women are the head of the family, and their power is indeed not small, but when I think about it today, the power of women is not as great as that of the cooks who cook, the tailors who sew clothes, the head carpenters and carpenters who build houses, and the waiters who provide services. If these people do not abandon their conscience and know the advantages and disadvantages of using domestic goods, I don’t think they will make jokes. At present, it seems to me that after the popularization of literacy education, the knowledge of anyone will naturally be higher, and the heart of patriotism will naturally flourish. If this cook has a deep understanding of righteousness and refuses to use any non-domestic food materials, it will be very powerful. Especially tailors, if the industry agrees on a covenant, they will refuse to make any non-domestic fabrics. How great is this power? The head carpenters and carpenters have always been used to making profits, but now, to say a conscientious word, it is worth trying domestic goods. Speaking of waiters, it is even more absurd. People don’t drink cold drinks, but they desperately sell soda and orange juice. They don’t ask whether the goods are domestic or not, as long as they make more money. Sometimes non-domestic beverages account for three-quarters, which is so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Cooks, tailors, waiters, head carpenters and carpenters, you are all Chinese. China is in such a recession, do you feel this way? It is worth sacrificing some for the country. You must remember, "Life depends on clothing, food, and housing, and we must not abandon our hearts."</p>
<h3>Strive to Promote the Production and Sales of Domestic Goods (Domestic Goods Forum)</h3>
<p>— Nanhai Seagull</p>
<p>What kind of world is this world? We have mouths, but we are not allowed to say what we want to say in our hearts; we have hands, but we are not allowed to do what we should do in our survival competition; we have feet, but we are not allowed to walk the path we should take in our life struggle. What kind of world is this world after all!</p>
<p>Other people praise us on the surface, exchange ambassadors with us, and improve our international status, but what is the reality? Not to mention France and the United Kingdom, these truly old-fashioned first-class countries, they can absolutely freely restrict the import of non-domestic goods to protect the sales of domestic goods. Even any country’s colony, such as the Dutch East Indies, French Annam, and Italian East Africa, are not formal countries and have no international status, but they can also absolutely freely sell domestic or local products and loudly advocate boycotting certain goods.</p>
<p>Our international status has now improved, but we are being bound by our neighbors step by step, replacing your hat and putting it on Li’s head for you, and taking meat from you to fill your wounds. You are not allowed to cry out injustice or pain. Opening the chicken coop door and listening to the weasel steal the chicken, you are not allowed to call out.</p>
<p>Our territorial waters are crossed by foreign iron warships; our airspace is filled with foreign aircraft; our markets are full of various non-domestic goods. Others have made clothes for us to wear ready-made; others have grown rice, baked bread for us to eat comfortably; others have made various modern and practical goods for us to use casually. Aren’t we just doing a thorough walking corpse in this world?</p>
<p>The front line of our national economy has been completely broken through! The economic defense barriers have been destroyed one by one. From now on, we can only rely on our conscience, fight on our own, and strive to produce and sell domestic goods and use domestic goods!</p>
<p>"Die to live, die to survive." We are now standing in a dead and dying place, "Its death, its death! Tied to the Bao Mulberry Tree," a conscientious war for oneself is our last self-education and only strategy!</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods and Literacy Movement (Domestic Goods Forum)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>It is indeed an urgent task to promote literacy education in China, where illiteracy is rampant. Because the literacy movement is also one of the seven major movements of the Kuomintang, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and other agencies are actively carrying out the great work of eliminating illiteracy in the city. According to surveys, there are already more than 500 literacy schools in preparation, which is of course an excellent phenomenon worthy of our gratification and support!</p>
<p>However, in the current situation where the literacy movement is booming, I believe that the domestic goods movement, which is related to the survival of China, should not be ignored, and we can take advantage of this opportunity of the literacy movement to also do the work of the domestic goods movement. The reporter has always believed that the domestic goods movement and the literacy movement are absolutely closely linked and can progress together!</p>
<p>Over the years, the domestic goods movement has not achieved significant results, and foreign goods are still filling the market. Although this is caused by various reasons, the lack of popular education in China, the low level of people's knowledge, and the weakness of the concept of the country have also caused the main reason for the sluggishness of domestic goods. Therefore, I believe that the first condition for promoting domestic goods is to popularize education and improve the people's knowledge; implement domestic goods education, so that the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of domestic goods, and from then on automatically abandon foreign goods and adopt domestic goods.</p>
<p>Here, I dare to say bluntly that most of the students who enter literacy schools have a very weak concept of the country. They only know how to exchange money for goods when buying goods. In their simple minds, there is no image of domestic or foreign goods at all, and they do not know the advantages and disadvantages of national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the first step now is to give them literacy education, and then we can instill in them the knowledge of domestic goods. Now, taking Shanghai as an example, there are already five or six hundred literacy schools, and there are no less than hundreds of thousands of students. If everyone is cultivated with a habit of using domestic goods, will the future of the domestic goods movement not be greatly helped and see the dawn?</p>
<h3>Sincere Advice to National Goods Companies in Various Places (Opinions on National Goods)</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The establishment of national goods companies in various places like a rising tide is truly a gratifying thing. During the spring vacation, I visited various places—Hangzhou, Suzhou, Songjiang—and learned that many of these goods were transported from Shanghai by manufacturers for promotion. Therefore, all the layouts and facilities within the companies, and even the way employees treat customers, carry some Shanghai store characteristics. After seeing this, on one hand, I admired their enthusiasm in acting as a mainstay for national goods; on the other hand, I also have some opinions to offer them for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Must Embrace the Principle of Affordable and High-Quality "Merchants seek profit, doing everything possible, and never operating at a loss." This saying is certainly correct. However, now that we are striving for the national goods industry, we must fulfill some obligations and show some willingness to sacrifice. While not operating at a loss, we must not sell inferior goods as high-quality goods or deliberately raise prices. These bad habits not only damage commercial ethics but also damage the reputation of national goods. We must not try to be clever. Because Shanghai merchants have a mentality that Shanghai people are experienced and knowledgeable, while inland people are naive, they are not concerned about promoting inferior national goods in the inland areas. In this way, wouldn't the national goods companies in the inland areas become places for selling off substandard and inferior goods? Even if they don't recognize the goods, if they compare them with foreign goods, wouldn't they cry out that they have been cheated? In this way, will national goods still have development? Therefore, manufacturers going to the inland areas must truly implement the four words "affordable and high-quality."</p>
<p>(2) Train Salespeople The slow service of salespeople in Shanghai stores has long been an undeniable fact. National goods companies also inevitably have this bad habit. In Japanese stores in Hongkou, they always bow and see customers to the door, regardless of whether a transaction is made or not. No matter how troublesome the customers are, they will never respond with harsh words. We don't need to learn all of this humble attitude, just half of it would be excellent. Salespeople in inland stores are generally more humble than those in Shanghai. If salespeople from Shanghai also go to the inland areas to show off their power and frequently speak offensively, then even if your goods are good, customers will only retreat and politely decline upon seeing these salespeople. Therefore, I believe that salespeople going to the inland areas must be strictly trained to cultivate a humble and patient attitude, as well as a sincere and thoughtful demeanor, to become model salespeople in the inland areas.</p>
<p>(3) Eliminate Unnecessary Promotion "Business thrives on promotion." This saying is certainly correct. However, promotion must also have appropriate limits. Tricks like "big sale" and "big clearance" are no longer effective. Even gimmicks like "selling at a loss" and "buy one foot, get five feet free" are not appreciated. Therefore, I believe that besides marking prices and explaining the functions of the goods, one must not use these types of promotions. Also, playing military music and beating big drums at the entrance has become a vulgar and unbearable form of promotion, and it is really unnecessary to play this game in the inland areas.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts After Reading "The National Beverage Movement"</h3>
<p>— Bing Ru</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yang An's article "The National Beverage Movement" in the previous issue of this publication, we cannot help but feel indignant for the national beverage industry and for our national character! Why do our people, especially the fashionable young men and women, love foreign goods so much? Thinking about the precariousness of our national situation, it is more than just heart-wrenching to weep blood. With the nation's demise imminent, we are still dreamily promoting foreign goods enthusiastically. If this is not servility, what else could it be!</p>
<p>I often think that Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods, not just beverages, but everything, is always "foreign goods are better." This is in stark contrast to foreigners who love to use their own national goods, even for small things like a match or a cigarette. Compared to this, how ashamed should we Chinese people be! In this hot summer, beverages are naturally booming. In my opinion, these beverages are not essential for life, but if we must consume them, then they must be national goods. Like beer, orange juice, and soda, the good ones are not much different from foreign goods, so why be insane and willingly be slaves to foreign goods? At the same time, those who run national beverage businesses must not focus solely on profit and produce inferior goods. They must not disregard quality and hygiene. As a result, they not only fail to benefit themselves but also bring shame to the national goods industry and strengthen the resolve of those who love foreign goods. This is truly something that cannot be taken lightly. Another point, which seems ordinary but is actually the most serious problem, is that the national goods industry likes to imitate foreign goods in its product labels and even uses foreign merchant names for distribution to cater to the Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods. They actually manage to achieve sales and profits this way. I believe that this kind of behavior has a "cause-and-effect" relationship with the Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods. Those who engage in this trickery may consider themselves clever, but in reality, it is an extremely foolish act and can be said to be the most heartbreaking behavior. We hope that patriotic Chinese people will correct their mistakes if they have them and strive to improve if they don't. In short, whether it is in manufacturing or distribution, there must be a comprehensive plan, followed by a spirit of struggle. On the consumer side, Chinese people must quickly and consistently become aware of their responsibilities. When the time comes when it is "too late to regret," you may not even have national goods to use.</p>
<h3>Cold Drinks and National Goods (National Goods Talk)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei Xuan</p>
<p>The wheels of time have swiftly turned to the summer season. Everywhere on the streets, one can see advertisements for ice cream and soda and flags fluttering in the air. Indeed, in such hot weather, everyone needs to consume some cold drinks to relieve the heat!</p>
<p>However, among the soda and ice cream sold on the market now, there are many national goods, but there are also quite a few foreign goods. For example, the ice cream that is most commonly sold in ice cream parlors and cinemas is manufactured by foreign merchants. According to a reporter's investigation, when the "Beauty" brand ice cream was at its peak, it could sell about a thousand dozen a day. Calculating the wholesale price per dozen at about one dollar and sixty or seventy cents, that means Chinese people are sending one thousand six or seven hundred dollars into the hands of foreigners every day. Over time, the amount becomes quite staggering! Although sales have declined somewhat now, it still occupies the top spot in ice cream sales. Moreover, the enjoyers of this ice cream are mostly from the bourgeois intellectual class, which cannot help but make us feel somewhat heartbroken!</p>
<p>In the past, one could perhaps say that Chinese cold drinks were not very scientific or hygienic, but now I believe that although Chinese industry and commerce are still lagging behind, and science is not as developed as in the West, the simple task of making ice cream ourselves is guaranteed to be safe to consume and is not inferior to foreign goods. So why must we consume imported ice cream and let the profits flow overseas!</p>
<p>Gentlemen who like to consume foreign soda and ice cream, in the hot summer, eating foreign ice cream can certainly cool your heart and lungs, but if you turn your head and think about how severe the Chinese national crisis is and how serious foreign economic aggression is, and you yourself are unwilling to consume national goods even for something as trivial as drinking ice cream, then the guilt in your conscience may cause the coolness all over your body to turn into sweat!</p>
<p>Compatriots! If ice cream has not frozen your heart and chilled your blood, then please stop consuming foreign ice cream and soda. Chinese cold drinks are also sufficient to relieve the heat!</p>
<h3>National Goods for Summer Use (National Goods Talk)</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Once summer arrives, apart from young men and fashionable ladies in Western attire, most ordinary people wear and use national goods, which is truly a good phenomenon. Therefore, summer can also be called the "National Goods Season." I also hope that the other three seasons will have the same phenomenon as summer, so that the number of excess imports will definitely drop to a low level. Now, let me briefly talk about the supplies for summer:</p>
<p>(1) Clothing Materials… Thin clothing materials, such as ramie cloth, Xiangyun yarn, and spun silk, are authentic national goods. Middle-class people like to wear them and have the ability to wear them. As for noble ladies, the georgette and voile they wear are neither durable nor national goods. They are truly not as practical as the ones mentioned above. There are also some working-class women and children who wear printed cotton cloth, which is not purely national goods either. I think it is better to wear homespun cloth. Another thing is that ramie cloth has not been popular in the past ten years, so no one wears it, which is also a heartbreaking thing. In fact, ramie cloth is light, refreshing, and durable. I think it is even better than georgette and voile. Patriotic people may wish to promote it.</p>
<p>(2) Straw Hats and Cork Hats… Straw hats have three grades: upper, middle, and lower. The upper grade is made of golden silk grass. I have some doubts about whether it is purely a national product. The middle and lower grades are made of wheat straw. Our country can make them ourselves. Although some foreign raw materials are mixed in (rubber bands, etc.), they can be said to be national goods. Also, the cork hats that have been popular recently, the good ones are made with cork pads. Although they are made by Chinese people, the raw materials are still foreign. The lower grades are lined with cardboard, and some foreign raw materials are also mixed in.</p>
<p>(3) Fans… Upper-class families use electric fans, and Chinese people can mostly make electric fans themselves. However, Chinese people have a mentality of being infatuated with foreign goods, so most of them buy foreign goods. The commonly used bamboo bone fans, goose feather fans, silk fans, and palm leaf fans are purely national goods. So in this regard, Chinese people can be very proud.</p>
<p>(4) Drinks… Fruit syrup, soda, ice cream, etc., inevitably contain some foreign raw materials, but Chinese people can make them themselves, so it can be said that foreign goods are not dominant. Moreover, these cold drinks are sold to noble people. Ordinary people still rely on watermelon and mung bean soup to relieve the heat, so this is not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>(5) Mosquito Coils… In rural areas, people are still using mosquito coils made of sulfur and wood chips. They covet the cheap price and do not care about hygiene. The ones used in cities are made of pyrethrum. They are very effective, hygienic, and national goods. Foreign goods have no room to intervene.</p>
<h3>A Worthy Organization to Introduce (National Goods News)</h3>
<p>— Sun Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Recently received a letter from an old friend Zhang in Bengbu: mentioning that there are enthusiastic comrades in the area who have organized a "Civic Group to Encourage the Use of National Goods," attached with printed materials such as charters and creeds, instructing me to promote them. After reading them, I felt they were worth introducing, so I excerpted one or two as follows: (1) Origins: Foreign goods are sold like mercury pouring onto the ground, penetrating every pore. Repeatedly, industry and commerce are increasingly exhausted. If we do not urgently promote national goods, then a large amount of money will flow out, leading to an unmanageable situation. We are aware of the responsibility of every citizen for the rise and fall of the nation, striving to wipe out the shame of "five-minute enthusiasm," organizing this group to prevent the national loan movement from falling behind in the Bengbu area. Therefore, we use everyone's strength to provide practical advice, not engaging in empty talk, not singing high-pitched tunes, supporting each other, and promoting each other, from individuals to families, and from families to society. The vision is outstanding; the drawbacks are clearly understood. If we can work practically and promote them from the ground up, the benefits of the harvest can be controlled. In general, those who only do lip service and are unwilling to work hard and set an example are not the same. (2) The charter stipulates that in addition to striving to promote national goods, the group will not inquire about other social matters, and the group's expenses are purely supported by enthusiastic people, without soliciting donations from the outside world, and doing their best to persuade relatives and friends to use national goods uniformly, not only focusing on the organization as a background, but also mobilizing individuals, borrowing this to collect money and selling their names. The drawbacks of this are prevented, and they are unwilling to take care of themselves alone, thinking from the aspect of persuasion everywhere, with the intention of painstaking effort. People are not wood or stone, and stubborn stones can still nod. Over time, they will inevitably be infected, from one to ten, and from ten to one hundred. All members can abide by this charter. Foreign goods will disappear from the market, resisting without resisting. (3) The creed is that individuals and families should prioritize the use of national goods. Persuade women not to use foreign cosmetics, not to smoke foreign cigarettes, not to drink foreign wine, persuade people to promote national goods at any time, and persuade store employees to do their best to promote national goods. We should keep in mind the crisis of the decline of industry and commerce and the decline of the countryside. Even if it is a penny, we must pay attention to buying foreign goods and not ignore that this is a small matter. Thinking everywhere, containing enlightenment of thought, making people silently recite this creed, like a thorn on the back, should be deeply vigilant. (4) In addition to writing striking sentences on various slogans, the edges are printed with words such as "Yimeizhai National Goods Mao Bian Paper Printing Shanghai Senji Paper Factory Production." This is a good example of leading by example, making people know at a glance that although there are not many Chinese paper mills, if you want to print slogans, you do not have to use paper from foreign sources. In a nutshell, if all provinces, cities, and counties can have this group to encourage the use of national goods, then the number of excess imports on the customs trade register will not only no longer increase, but can also decrease. I hope that enthusiastic comrades from all over the world will unite and organize, and do not let Bengbu alone be beautiful in the past. I can't help but lead the neck and wait.</p>
<h3>My Views on Improving Coarse Paper to Save the Countryside (National Goods Research)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Ten out of ten Chinese men suffer from hemorrhoids, and nine out of ten women suffer from leukorrhea, mostly due to the coarse paper used, which contains a lot of lime and has not been bleached clean. Regardless of whether papermaking materials are rice straw, wheat stalks, tree bark, hemp bark, bamboo shoots, or corn husks, etc., if you want to extract its fiber (that is, the tendons that do not dissolve when cooked), you must use strong alkaline substances to rot the skin and flesh and dissolve the fat to achieve the goal. The cheapest of any alkaline substance is lime, so using lime to pickle paper materials is indeed an ancient method, but it must be because it has been passed down for a long time, and the procedures are only for the sake of convenience, resulting in the loss of its essence. In my opinion, its function does not lie in lime, but in another thing, taking its essence and abandoning the dross, but people have not noticed it. What is it, it is mulberry firewood, or rice straw, wheat stalks, bean pods, cotton seed shells, wormwood, leaves, weeds, etc., when used as fuel, accumulate its ash, soak it with water to extract the juice, these are all raw materials of "potassium carbonate," in this ash juice, add "quicklime," it will heat up and boil, and a substitution reaction will occur, one side forms a precipitate of "calcium carbonate," and the other side forms a solution of "caustic potash," the equation is as follows,</p>
<p>From the above, it is sufficient to know that the function of corrosion lies entirely in caustic potash, and not in lime, and lime has become calcium carbonate, if it covers the surface of the substance, it is enough to protect the material from corrosion, so it must be removed the precipitate but use the supernatant to soak the plants, then the finished product can be free of lime, and there is still some hydrated lime in the supernatant, especially when a little salt brine or salt is added to it, so that it can change, one side forms "calcium chloride" for solubility, to avoid covering the object, and the other side forms "caustic soda" to help the corrosion, the equation is as follows,</p>
<p>From the above, it is sufficient to know that lime is completely useless, but only takes a portion of its nourishment, so that it combines with (light two nourish) to form caustic used as a medium for exchange, according to this method, the paper made, its nature must be soft and fine, but how its matching dosage, must be known by the operator, and in fact more use less use, has nothing to do, but more use is uneconomical, less use is abandonment, now described in detail as follows,</p>
<p>The amount of ash juice is such that the ash is added with water, and it is full for two or three inches. Assume that A is a pool with a leaking bottom, with a gate next to it, with a bamboo mat or reed mat in the gate, and a ditch outside the gate, so that the juice flows out and is stored in pool B, then take the ash juice in pool B, and put it in a bamboo tube about one foot long, and use a "Poe Mei Specific Gravity Table" to measure it, mostly not more than five degrees, that is, five degrees, the component of potassium carbonate contained therein is equal to five percent, if it is three degrees, then that is three percent, although the wet charcoal in pool A has been juiced, it can still be used to fertilize the field, that is, "potassium-containing fertilizer," the lime foot with water can also be used to fertilize the field, where the soil is too solid, it can be changed into loose and opposite to gypsum, as for the matching amount of potassium carbonate and quicklime, it should be as follows,</p>
<p>For every 100 jin of solid potassium carbonate used, 56 jin of quicklime should be used, but lime contains stone that has been burned through, so it is okay to use 60 jin for easy calculation, now if the specific gravity of the ash juice is five degrees, that is, 100 jin only contains 5 jin, quicklime should only need 3 jin, more use is waste, less use is to abandon the effective ingredients, which are not cost-effective, the easiest calculation method is to put water in a wooden bucket, weigh its weight, then pour out the water, but weigh the wooden bucket, remove the weight of the wooden bucket, you will know how much water weighs, assuming it is 100 jin, then put ash juice in this bucket instead, weigh it, remove the weight of the wooden bucket, you will know how much heavier the ash juice is than water, if real water weighs 100 jin, and the same amount of ash juice, weighs up to 105 jin, that is equal to five degrees of "Poe Mei Table," you can know the specific gravity of its content without having to buy a table.</p>
<p>Papermaking materials, whether rice straw, wheat stalks, tree bark, bamboo shoots, hemp silk, rags, etc., should be used per 100 jin, but only 15 jin of caustic potash should be used, but you can make it excessive to take speed rot, then add 20% of the amount, 18 jin should be used as appropriate, the above-mentioned 100 jin of 5-degree ash juice, add 3 jin of quicklime, the supernatant contains caustic potash is also only 3 jin, then 100 jin of paper material, that is, 600 jin of supernatant should be used, of which there is 18 jin of caustic potash content, this 600 jin of ash juice is not valuable, the valuable is only 18 jin of quicklime, the price of lime is only 1 yuan and 2 cents per load, and it is a double-jin scale, each jin is only 6 cents, 18 jin is calculated as 20 jin, which is only 1 cent and 2 points, compared to the same force using 25 pounds of caustic soda, its cost is not reasonable.</p>
<p>Rice straw and other things are not valuable, because they are huge, the transportation cost is very expensive, so the price in the city is equal to any fuel, each 100 jin needs 3 cents or more, if in the countryside, you can take the rotten grass changed from the thatched house, the price must be cheap and easy to rot, each 100 jin is temporarily 1 cent and 2 points, then the price of lime is 2 cents and 4 points in total, the finished material is about 35 jin, in terms of labor and materials, then each 100 jin of paper material, but sell 1 yuan and 4 corners is enough, each 1,680 jin is one ton, that is only 24 yuan, if the pie is formed by screening like bean cake, dried and bundled, and cooperate with the paper mill, using mechanical power to make coarse paper, in terms of its consumption, that is, 400 million people, each person uses one sheet every day, which is also considerable, the cooperation method should be divided into percentages in the selling price, or the raw materials and finished products, for the exchange of goods, then both sides can get convenience, if you think that the paper mill is a big buyer, then foreign manufacturers can release a three-month account, and there is no need for processing and refinement, that is, you can directly change money, if you want him to abandon this and take this, without a large capital organization, you cannot compete with it, so I think that you should start with the improvement of coarse paper cooperation, then in an instant, you can become a reality, and will not always be in a dream, to save the countryside, to resist the imported grass paper and machine-made gray newspaper, there is really only this one way out, why not work hard, but shout why, its stupidity is not reachable, it is deeply regretted, I made this in the disease, may think that the will is a prophecy, regarded as the same as Liu Ji's prophecy, those who know will be able to suddenly, so that my papermaking industry of more than 4,000 years, will not be eliminated, then my eyes are closed, on the Heavenly Gift Festival of Yi Hai in Die Zhuang on the South Mountain Road of West Lake, such as willing to cooperate, can directly contact the Liyong Papermill of Huishan Bridge in Wuxi, sorry for not writing letters.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Children are born like a blank sheet of paper, with a pure body and a spirit as soft as white wax, just waiting for us to paint and print on it at any time.</p>
<p>"A clever child may not be a successful adult," which proves that a child is affected by the adverse environment and poor education when growing up.</p>
<p>Confucius often liked to display sacrificial utensils when he was young, Mencius' mother moved three times because of Mencius' bad habits, and the French general Napoleon liked to set up stones as a formation when he was young. It can be seen that the choice of leisure life has a significant impact on children.</p>
<p>European and American children's games often like to imitate professional behavior, Japanese children's games like to simulate war, and the games of our uncompetitive Chinese children often end up on the road to gambling.</p>
<h3>Sketch of a Trolley Bus</h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>A trolley bus is like a box, with a very small capacity, but it is always packed with people. Needless to say, seats are rarely empty, and even the rattan rings are always hanging with thin white or thick black arms. Sometimes it is even more crowded, so that women are not given seats, and they don't hang on the rattan rings, but are thrown into people's arms, bumping east and west. The young men are naturally happy, but older people will also issue warnings:</p>
<p>——Be careful of pickpockets! When people are crowded, thieves will come up. Everyone be careful of your pockets!</p>
<p>But the more crowded the people, the better the ticket seller is at exploiting them. His eyes are constantly probing the station, his stomach is constantly calculating, and his hands are constantly fiddling with the tickets or copper coins, taking back the tickets from the people getting off the bus and stuffing them to the passengers who have given the copper coins but have not yet received the tickets. Sometimes, in order to make up for the loopholes, he has to exchange them with other passengers, always trying to make the route and price of each ticket match, so that the ticket inspectors cannot see it. When there are slightly fewer passengers, he seems to tap his temples with his index finger in embarrassment, and says with a forced smile.</p>
<p>——My head is killing me!</p>
<p>A passenger in a black Indian silk gown interjected and said:</p>
<p>——Your head doesn't hurt, but you earn your money comfortably!</p>
<p>The ticket seller simply put on a bold face to reply:</p>
<p>——It's okay if I run into good passengers; if I run into bad ones, I'll be scolded. It's not easy to earn a few pennies——</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the New World Station had arrived; he stuffed a first-class ticket that he had just received to a third-class passenger who had just boarded the bus, seemingly kindly inviting him to sit in first class, but that passenger was confused instead.</p>
<p>Sitting on a trolley bus, although very uncomfortable, allows you to see every Ukiyo-e picture.</p>
<h3>Clear Distinction Between Black and White</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Appreciating every art exhibition, I think anyone is enjoying some coolness of mind in this dull era: the attraction of the Black and White Society's Third Shadow Exhibition drew me to visit the venue. Coincidentally, I ran into Mr. Chen Chuanlin, the backbone of the society. After two years apart, without saying anything else, I first went to see dozens of his works; "Solo Joy" is a goose learning to fly like a butterfly, with water waves circling around, very vivid. Even more wonderful is that there are two black shadows of unequal length rippling in the upper corner, as if they are the reflections of willow branches on the shore or reeds in the water, full of poetic and artistic flavor.</p>
<p>Seeing Lu Shifu's photography, there is a "Tidal Bore Child," and in the conversation, I learned that it was a scene of being photographed back to shore in the midst of stormy waves, expressing novelty in ordinary subjects.</p>
<p>The posture of morning clouds, the breath of autumn rain, and the curves of light frowns and shallow smiles have been appreciated too much in past photography: In this year's Black and White Exhibition, there are several newcomers who have produced works such as "Wheat Pipe," "Pattern," and "Past Facts," which are rich in the interest of pattern photography, and are all created in a fresh and pleasing way.</p>
<p>This is my feature of the Black and White Third Shadow Exhibition! All in all, all of the works are "clearly distinguished between black and white."</p>
<p>In the end, I suddenly thought of the Huashi Society, which has a long history but is sleeping soundly; here I respectfully offer a little incense, looking forward to their holding an exhibition, so that the garden of Chinese film and art can be quickly expanded! Fame shakes the universe!</p>
<h3>Collaborative Efforts, Collective Strength</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: The Cheap Curtains Conceal Tear Stains, It's Hard to Escape Cold Fate; Fine Garments Flaunt Fortune, Having Once Reached the Halls of Power</p>
<p>That bride. At this moment, she finally revealed herself, her hand lifting the door curtain, revealing more than half of her body through the crack. At the same time, one could see her complexion, which seemed to carry a hint of fatigue on her yellowed and thin face. Her two eyes were puffy, as if somewhat swollen. This led one to think that the weary color on her face, and the faintly visible marks, all seemed to be stained by tears. She wasn't secretly watching Zhiqian here, but was peering towards the tea room. When she noticed that Zhiqian was also reading the newspaper in the crowd, she immediately shrank back inside and lowered the curtain. Zhiqian thought that if he wanted to see her, there was no need to keep peeping at her here. He didn't understand the meaning of peeping, and she might think he was intentionally teasing her. So, he put down the newspaper and walked out of the Little Western Paradise's main gate. It was almost dinnertime at four o'clock in the afternoon when he finally went back. But as soon as he reached the last courtyard, before he could enter the room, Zhang Jie stopped him to talk. Today, he was particularly well-dressed, wearing a mandarin jacket over his long gown. The bronze-colored felt hat wasn't tilted haphazardly on his head as usual, but its edges were very neat, circling his head. The crease on the top of the hat formed a straight line with his nose. Needless to say, his face was looking directly at people, without any incorrect expression. Originally, Zhiqian hadn't paid attention to his expression, but since he had stopped him, he couldn't ignore him. He stood firmly, then raised the sleeves of his mandarin jacket and bowed twice. Zhiqian was a little bewildered by this. Why was he giving him this salute? He had no choice but to stand still and return the bow. (268)</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance, Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, it's hard to guarantee that she won't keep this matter in mind, always considering me a guilty person. As long as she encounters any convenient opportunity, she will bring up the old matter and blame me as well, wouldn't that leave me with no way to redress my grievances?</p>
<p>"I really don't know!" I asked the female official again with a pleading tone, "Then please tell me, what kind of punishment should I receive?"</p>
<p>"Beheading!"</p>
<p>Ah! This really scared me to death! Although the Empress Dowager didn't say anything to me in person, maybe she had already issued an imperial decree. Tomorrow morning, perhaps, I would be captured and beheaded!</p>
<p>"But you know I was just acting out of good intentions, because her old self's fever hadn't subsided, so I advised her against it!" I hurriedly told the female official the truth, hoping she would pity me and find a way to resolve the situation. "I never intended to disobey the imperial decree!"</p>
<p>"Alright! Just be careful! Right now, the Empress Dowager is favoring you, so she might not pursue the matter. But who can guarantee that you will always be favored by her? And she will never forget this matter. When that time comes, I'll see what clever ways you have to keep your head on your neck! Don't you think you're the smartest!" (368)</p>
<p>Translator's note: My draft's handwriting is too careless, causing the proofreaders to often misread, mistaking characters frequently (such as "three fingers taking the pulse," where "three" was mistaken for five, being one such example). I am honored by the readers pointing out errors, thank you very much.</p>
<h3>The Plight of Imperial Physicians</h3>
<p>— Wu Aibo</p>
<p>This publication's "Imperial Fragrance, Misty Record" recently serialized the strange scene of four imperial physicians kneeling to take the pulse of the Empress Dowager when she was ill, which made readers laugh. In an autocratic dynasty, the plight of subjects serving their rulers was like this, truly beyond the dreams of us republican citizens.</p>
<p>Recently, I read "Notes from the Studio of Fine Weather and Haze," which also contained a passage recording the plight of being an imperial physician, said to be from the mouth of an old imperial physician, which can serve as additional evidence for "Imperial Fragrance, Misty Record." I record it below:</p>
<p>My friend, Fang Jun, said that he once consulted an old doctor who had served as a grand physician, so he inquired about matters in the palace. The old man said: Serving the court is not easy. I was over fifty years old when I was appointed to the position. Being on duty was the most difficult of all the tasks. One often had to stay for three days. At daybreak, one had to put on court attire and sit upright, but sometimes nothing happened all day, and one didn't dare to sleep until after midnight. Because one was so close to the inner palace, one resided next to the Qianqing Gate. Any man with a beard who entered without being summoned would be put to death, so one had to stay hidden and dare not wander around. Or, just as one was about to fall asleep at night, a eunuch would suddenly come out to summon one, and one would immediately put on one's clothes and follow him. The palace steps were high and steep, and the paths were winding. Only the eunuch carried a small red gauze lantern, the light was very dim, but he was familiar with the path and walked very fast. One had to stumble along to keep up, so that one was sweating profusely. If one was in the palace compound, one could still sit to take the pulse. One night, I received an imperial summons and entered. Kneeling before the couch, I took the emperor's pulse, but my panting was almost uncontrollable. The emperor said, "Why are you trembling so much? If you're like this in front of me, you must be terrified to death in front of others." In reality, the sense of awe and fear was not as exhausting as the labor of rushing around. It was only because the proximity of the emperor's face caused one to lose one's composure. After leaving, one would present the pulse records and prescriptions under the corridor. Whether the medicine was effective was unknown, but there were often rewards. However, every time one received them from the Imperial Household Department, one had to pay customary fees, and the awarded items were often secretly exchanged, so that one's meager salary was almost exhausted as a result. What he talked about was probably during the Guangxu period, truly no different from an aging actor in the imperial garden, recalling old days.</p>
<p>I have always said that our country's emphasis on taking the pulse is due in part to etiquette and in part to the political system. Looking at what "Imperial Fragrance, Misty Record" and "Notes from the Studio of Fine Weather and Haze" say, one can see that my words are not false.</p>
<p>Travels</p>
<h3>Rainy Tour of Minhang</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Last Saturday, Brother Yin wanted to go to Shanghai High School to visit Mr. Jianyun's son, and I ended up going with him because Shanghai High School is southwest of Caohejing, not far from Minhang. When we set off, the weather was very bright, with no hint of rain. Brother Yin's young son and a Mr. Sun also went with us.</p>
<p>I had heard before that Minhang was called "Little Shanghai." Although it's forty or fifty miles from Shanghai, it's said that the scenery there is quite good. The four of us left Shanghai High School and headed south in the car, stepping on the gas and flying straight to our destination.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, perhaps this misfortune, in the mouths of the local people, would be considered a cause for celebration! On this short trip, a heavy downpour came down without any courtesy. The car was on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, so we didn't feel it much, only the car roof dripped water, and everyone's clothes and hats got wet. Before long, we arrived in Minhang. The driver wasn't very familiar with the roads here, and Mr. Sun, who volunteered to be our guide, had only been there once twenty years ago, and it had changed a lot since then, so he couldn't recognize it either.</p>
<p>The car stopped near the Huangpei Bund water terminal. The rain was coming down harder and harder. Brother Yin really wanted to turn back, but Mr. Sun, with his sudden burst of enthusiasm, kept saying, "Since we're here, let's make the best of it." There are plenty of good taverns here, why don't we take a break? I was agreeable to anything, so we got out of the car in the rain. It was funny, we hadn't even found the town yet. We walked three or four hundred steps west along the Huangpu River, and everyone's underwear was soaked. Not only could we not see any shops, we couldn't even run into a single person. Just when we were in a dilemma, a boatman who looked like a sailor walked towards us. We asked him for directions, and he told us that the town was to the southeast. We were going in the opposite direction, no wonder we were getting further and further away from it.</p>
<p>That boatman was very kind. He said, "Why don't you go to the 'People's Education Hall' up ahead for a bowl of tea, and wait for the rain to stop before going into town?" So we listened to him and walked to the People's Education Hall, not far from where we had parked. Part of the place was set aside for selling tea, and it was quite clean. Although the doors and walls were covered with many slogans and pictures about "People's Education," most of the people were just tea drinkers. Mr. Sun asked the tea server and found out that there was a very nice dance hall here, where young Cantonese dancers catered exclusively to the sailors and foreigners. Mr. Sun was eager to try it out and insisted on dragging us to the dance hall. Fortunately, a chartered rickshaw came to solicit his business. The rickshaw puller said that it was too early to dance, why not take a tour of the whole town first? It's not too late to go to the "volcano" later. Brother Yin and I also encouraged him, so he sat in the only chartered rickshaw in the whole town. Brother Ma also sat with him. The two of us borrowed two umbrellas from the teahouse and followed the rickshaw, touring the streets in the rain on foot. As it turned out, we ran down all three streets in the town, but there wasn't a single decent tavern. It was also a case of "hearsay is unreliable."</p>
<p>The town itself was not bad. There were all kinds of shops, but the rain had dampened business. Most of the shopkeepers were leaning on the counters, watching the rain.</p>
<p>After running down these three streets, the rain still hadn't stopped, and it was almost dusk. Everyone got back in the car and told him to hurry back to Shanghai. Mr. Sun still thought it was a great "disappointment" that he hadn't made it to the "volcano."</p>
<h3>A Waste of a Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>— (Yinghui)</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, several years ago, once ventured into the world of pleasure and contracted gonorrhea and leukorrhea. He sought medical treatment east and west, but to little effect. Since contracting the illness, it came and went. The cost of medicine was more than a thousand yuan. He felt economically constrained and had no choice but to abandon treatment. However, the virus was in his body, and it caused all sorts of problems. Recently, it had even worsened, with blood mixed in his urine from time to time. His joints ached all over, and his testicles were swollen. He suffered greatly when walking. He often felt bloating and pain in the lower abdomen and bladder, and his urine dripped. The gentleman deeply felt the difficulty of suffering from the illness. He thought about continuing treatment, but was afraid of being disappointed as before and wasting money. If he didn't treat it, it would drag on and on. He knew that he had completely lost hope for his health and future. Just when he was in a dilemma, he happened to see in the newspaper that the Tongren Western Medicine Company, located at No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, sold a holy medicine for treating gonorrhea called "Gonado Den," priced at two yuan per box. So he bought it and tried taking it. Sure enough, after finishing one box, his condition was greatly reduced. After two boxes, the disease was completely cured. To be on the safe side, he bought and took another box, and the chronic illness of several years was completely cured from then on. The gentleman deeply felt the efficacy of Gonado Den, so he introduced it to all his friends who suffered from gonorrhea and leukorrhea, and they all recovered as soon as they took the medicine. Therefore, the gentleman said that if "Gonado Den" had come out earlier, I wouldn't have wasted a thousand yuan in the past.</p>
<h3>Superiority and Inferiority Immediately Visible</h3>
<p>— (Junmou)</p>
<p>There is a certain lady who has suffered from red and white vaginal discharge for many years. Because she is very ashamed, she has never sought medical treatment. She only bought and took ready-made medicines for treating red and white vaginal discharge sold on the market. She took no fewer than dozens of kinds, but none of them had any effect. Recently, it has even affected her whole body, causing her to become thin and sallow, lose her appetite, have bloating and pain in her lower abdomen, and have sore waist and weak limbs. She is particularly miserable in this summer season when she wears light and thin clothes. This is because the symptoms of red and white vaginal discharge not only stain her underwear. Sometimes it affects her outer clothing and is also stained, making her feel even more embarrassed. If she often ties menstrual belts tightly, she feels hot and uncomfortable. Ordinary women in the hot summer, even during the few days of menstruation when they are healthy, still feel discomfort in the lower body. How much more uncomfortable is she, suffering from red and white vaginal discharge, unable to feel comfortable for a single day until the disease is cured. The lady was really unbearable. One day, a girlfriend returned from Shanghai and saw the lady and asked, "Why are you so thin and sallow, sister?" The lady said, "I have suffered from red and white vaginal discharge for many years. I have taken no fewer than dozens of kinds of ready-made medicines sold on the market, but none of them have had any effect. I feel pain in my mind and depression in my thoughts. How can I not be thin?" Her girlfriend said, "Why didn't you tell me sooner? It wouldn't have come to this. I myself have also had this disease. After taking the internal White Discharge Pills and the external White Discharge Medicine sold by the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, it only cost two yuan for each kind, and now it is completely cured." The lady heard this and immediately mailed to purchase several boxes and took them according to the instructions. This chronic disease of many years was cured in just ten days. From this, it can be proved that the superiority and inferiority of ready-made medicines sold on the market are immediately visible.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Bullish Sentiment in the Gold Market Remains Unabated, Repeatedly Breaking the 60 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>However, Restricted by the Standard Price, Supply is Abundant After Reaching High Levels; Although the Foreign Exchange Market is Relaxed, People Are Optimistic and Expect Another 3 Yuan Increase</p>
<p>The market continued to rise yesterday, and buying interest was easily triggered. However, due to the Central Bank's restriction on the standard gold price, supply became abundant after reaching high levels. Moreover, the foreign exchange market was not entirely consistent, and there were still signs of decline midway. With people being optimistic, the results were still firm. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a slight contraction, New York remained unchanged, and the forward silver price in Montreal rose by one to two and a half points. Exchange rates were flat, and the price of raw gold in London rose by two pence, but people seemed difficult to satisfy.

The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both British and American exchange rates remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit rising by two points.

In addition, the informal market eased, with the Associated Press reporting news that the United States might abolish the silver profits tax, breaking below the 60 yuan mark again, suddenly turning weak. Unexpectedly, the selling momentum stopped when it saw a low price, and the market again showed signs of demand exceeding supply. Soon after, it rebounded above 60 yuan, stabilizing by the noon close. Continued gains occurred after the market closed. Although the morning market was strong, people were still somewhat uncertain. The forward premium rose to 3 yuan again. Today, the morning market situation is recorded below:</p>

Guangdong small silver dollars rose 8 "jiao" in the morning, opening at 735.2 yuan, and then increased by another 3 "jiao" in the afternoon, opening at 735.5 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rise Sharply to Cover Short Positions; Gold Shorts Rise by a Maximum of One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a clear public bond market. After repeated support from various parties, short sellers could no longer hold out and retreated, leading to a strong upward trend. Various bonds rose in succession, and the situation was extremely sharp. It appeared that short positions were gradually being covered on the trading floor, and there was a possibility of continued gains in the future. Yesterday's activity saw the "Bian Qian" bond initially decline slightly in the morning opening, but numerous buyers emerged, absorbing bonds at 47, 34, and 59. Furthermore, the 48 bond, which held a large long position of over 10 million, increased its position, further threatening short sellers. All bonds rose along the way, ranging from 20 to 60 cents. In the second session, 46 and other bonds continued to be absorbed, and all bonds rose by about 50 cents again. In summary, the market prices in both sessions rose sharply, ranging from 30 to 50 cents to one yuan. The total transaction volume was 1,571 yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Unchanged</p>
<p>Sin Fung Yoko reported yesterday (16th) that the New York stock market was largely unchanged. Speculators were uncertain when Congress would adjourn and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The main event of the day was the Boston Court of Appeals' ruling that the stamp tax was unconstitutional. However, it had no impact on the stock market. Sugar and cotton fell as a result of the ruling, but commodities did not plummet, which was unexpected. This was because speculators still wanted to await the Supreme Court's review. The bond market was mixed, with Italian public bonds experiencing a sharp decline before slightly recovering. The atmosphere in the small exchange stock market was slightly looser. The total volume of transactions for the day was 900,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>15th 16th Change</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Prices Rise Increasingly Fiercely</h3>
<p>Active Yarn Sales… Auction Prices Rise… Severe Flooding</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with cash sales developing. The Sichuanese merchants, who had been stagnant for a long time, began purchasing large quantities of Chinese yarn. The supply of spot yarn was tight. At the same time, the chips in the yarn warehouse became more active. The recent rise was particularly strong. Covering of short positions further boosted the market.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Price Rise Is Strongest</p>
<p>Auctioned yarn opened higher across all months. Due to the improvement in the spot yarn market the previous day, Sichuanese merchants initiated purchases. In addition, chip trading on the exchange became more active. Many yarn mills were closed, further boosting sentiment. As the auction progressed through the second and third sessions, raw cotton advanced step by step, and the yarn market tightened further, with prices rising steadily. However, as the auction approached the closing bell, those who profited sold off, and the distant months weakened slightly. As a result, the near months rose by 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 "jiao" compared to the previous day's closing price, while the distant months rose by 6 and 8 "jiao." Sold lots included: Da Fu 550 bales, Tong Fu 1,000 bales, Tong Ji 600 bales, Yi Da 500 bales, Yu Da 650 bales, Sui Long 550 bales, Yuan Da 1,000 bales, He Xing 1,250 bales, Geng Feng 450 bales, Jun Chang 850 bales, Yuan Yi 750 bales, De Ji 750 bales, Ji Feng 900 bales, Yu Kang 1,000 bales, Da Feng 600 bales, Da Ji 800 bales, Jin Chang 850 bales, Rui Da 850 bales, Chang Yu 700 bales, Shen Ji 550 bales, Ren Feng 450 bales, Da Chang Cheng 500 bales, and Yi Chang 1,000 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Auctioned Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>July 163.6 162.7 163.5 Up 1.70 17,800</p>
<p>August 165.9 164.6 165.9 Up 1.80 39,550</p>
<p>September 167.7 166.5 167.6 Up 1.60 37,900</p>

<p>December 169.3 168.5 169.0 Up 0.60 13,900</p>
<p>Total 186,150</p>
<p>Sichuanese Merchants Purchase Large Quantities of Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales continued smoothly. It was found that all merchants bought a total of 3,505 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 1.2 yuan. Over 300 bales of Japanese yarn were traded. The purchase amounts for each merchant are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 340, "You Tou" 215, Hai Zhou 141</p>
<p>Nanjing 30, Lu Zhou 40, Inland 50</p>
<p>Sichuan 2,050, Jiangxi 100, Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Henan 225, Changsha 510, Weihaiwei 20</p>
<p>Da Tong 20</p>
<p>The cotton market price increase has intensified, and auction prices have gradually reached new highs. There is also a saying that upstream areas have experienced severe flooding, severely damaging cotton fields and significantly reducing the new cotton harvest. As a result, buyers are enthusiastically purchasing. However, the recent rise has been particularly aggressive. Considering the market situation, new cotton may break through the 3-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao: Strong Sentiment</p>
<p>Auctioned cotton opened higher across all months. However, U.S. cotton fell 10 points, while Indian cotton rose 1.5 rupees. As the auction progressed through the second and third sessions, the upward trend intensified, and prices jumped sharply. Sellers were scarce in the market. Generally, due to the tightness of the trading floor, those with floating positions rushed to cover short positions. Due to the severe flooding in the Henan area and the significant losses of new cotton, they continued to buy and go long. It is said that Japanese merchants also purchased in the distant months. As a result, the market rose higher and higher. The prices for each month rose by 2, 3, and 4 "jiao" compared to the previous day's closing price. Sold lots included: Tong Fu 1,200 "dan," Tong Ji 2,100 "dan," Yu Da 1,500 "dan," Sui Long 1,400 "zu," Yuan Da 4,000 "dan," Jin Chang 3,000 "dan," Ming De 1,200 "niu," He Xing 2,400 "dan," Geng Feng 1,000 "dan," Xie Cheng 1,200 "dan," Yong Da 1,000 "dan," Xin Hua 1,100 "dan," De Ji 1,100 "dan," Yuan Xing Chang 1,900 "dan," and Yi Feng 1,700 "dan." Bought lots included: Ji Feng 1,600 "dan," Da Fu 2,900 "dan," Da Feng 2,500 "dan," Ming Hua 1,100 "dan," Jun Chang 2,000 "dan," Shen Ji 3,200 "dan," Bai Dan, and Yi Kang 1,800 "dan." The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>July 33.40 33.05 33.30 Up 0.40 75,80</p>

<p>Total 558,400</p>
<p>Factory Demand Remains Ordinary</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still ordinary. The source of supply is estimated to be 276 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Closes Positions, Indian Cotton Covers Shorts</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened higher due to good news from Liverpool, with all months rising by 1 to 5 points. Subsequently, as Wall Street sold off and long positions were closed, prices gradually declined. The closing was flat. Spot prices fell by 5 points, while futures prices fell by 11 to 13 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 1 point. Indian cotton initially softened due to selling by a few European exporters, but then rose due to short covering and speculative buying. The Pingguo Er rose by 1.5 rupees, the Aomula rose by 1 to 2.25 rupees, and the Bairuo Creek rose by 0.5 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 16th). According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the Bairuo Creek cotton for the 4th and 5th periods on the 17th was 222 rupees, down 2.75 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>

<h3>Grains: Merchants Compete to Load This Month's Cargo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market rose unanimously. Although the quotation for foreign wheat fluctuated slightly, with Chicago up 4 points for near months and down 1 "jiao" for distant months, and Canada up 4 points, sentiment was initially stable. However, due to the floods along the Yangtze River, such as in Jiujiang, Hankou, and Changsha, there was considerable demand for loading cargo. The Tianjin merchants also joined in, absorbing supplies as sentiment improved, causing the market to improve gradually. The highest closing price was raised to 3.425 "jiao," a rebound of 5 to 6 "fen" compared to the beginning of the week. The market for distant months was also good, but factory owners took the opportunity to sell off, so the increase was not as large as for the current month. If actual sales continue to be active and foreign wheat does not become scarce, the current month's price may have to be raised. As a result, the current month rose by 2.5 "fen," August rose by 2.225 "fen," September rose by 1.7 "fen," October rose by 1 "fen," November rose by 0.7 "fen," and December rose by 1.2 "fen."</p>
<h3>Short Covering in Distant Wheat Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon sessions, the market for each month showed signs of weakness in the near months and stability in the distant months. The current month was naturally difficult to boost due to the accumulation of spot wheat and the stagnant demand in factories, so bidding was weak. As for the distant months, as sellers were scarce and short positions were covered, sentiment was relatively stable. Furthermore, the recent exchange rate was tighter, so the dumping of foreign wheat may be temporarily halted, making the market more stable. As a result, the current month fell by 4 "fen," August rose by 2 "fen," and September and October rose by 1 "fen." The spot wheat market was still not fully active in the factories. The market was stable for high-priced goods, while medium and low-priced goods remained at their previous levels. Shandong wheat was priced at 3.389 yuan, Yao Wan Yanghe wheat was priced at 3.38 yuan, secondary wheat was priced at 6 "fen," Mingguang wheat was priced at 3.37 yuan, Wuyi wheat was priced at 3.34 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was priced at 3.31 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat was priced at 3.3 yuan, secondary wheat was priced at 2.9 yuan, Hezhou wheat was priced at 3.17 yuan, Shaobo wheat was priced at 3.28 yuan, Wuhe wheat was priced at 3.334 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat was priced at 3.22 yuan, and secondary wheat was priced at 2.2 "jiao." 7,000 bags were taken by Fu Xin.</p>

<p>Hot Weather Leads to Panic Selling of Rice Stocks</p>
<p>The source of rice (South Shanghai) for each merchant was similar to before, with only about ten or so arriving. Therefore, although sales continued to be sluggish on this street, merchants from Qingdao, Yantai, and other regions continued to purchase 400 to 500 bags, allowing the market to maintain its position. The prices of various thick "geng" and thin "dao" varieties remained stable for high-quality rice, while medium-quality rice depreciated by several "fen" to a "jiao." "Yin Bian Yuan" rice also remained flat and weak (North Shanghai). The source of rice from various routes was about eleven or twelve. The market for "Bai Geng" rice slightly improved, and prices were stable. Sales of thin "dao" rice remained sluggish, and prices were stable for high-quality rice, while medium and low-quality rice prices decreased by a small amount of 1 to 2 "jiao." Early rice was slightly more liquid for short-term purchases, and the market was slightly higher. Old, low-quality rice varied in price. "Bai Yuan" rice was gradually declining and becoming unsustainable. Store purchases became more active, causing prices to rise by 3 to 4 "jiao."</p>
<p>The market for foreign rice continued to decline. Due to the excessively hot weather in recent days, warehouse owners and cargo owners were all panicking and trying to sell. In addition, the prices of river factories' rice had previously plummeted, inevitably affecting foreign rice. More warehouse owners lowered prices to sell, causing prices to continue to fall by 1 "jiao" to several "fen." In the afternoon, sales to the Yangtze River region were active, stabilizing the downward trend. However, the quantity sold was not large, and the market did not improve. The city sold a total of 4,500 bags of Saigon rice and 3,000 bags of high-quality "Gong Xiao Jiao Shu" rice. They were distributed to Hankou, Shashi, Jiujiang, Ningbo, Nanjing, inland areas, and this street.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slightly Increased Transactions in Coarse Sand and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly stabilized by the strong rise in customs gold, and transactions increased. The association's auction of spot goods for No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was completed at 15.95 yuan, with 300 to 400 bags traded. Re-export goods were priced at 4.8 yuan, with no transactions. Taikoo's B-mark car white sugar was priced at 17.25 yuan, up 5 "fen." The local factory's Zhenyu No. 1 refined sugar was priced at 15.25 yuan, also up 5 "fen." The domestic Zhengmian Chi sugar was still soft due to the lack of insistence from the manufacturers. Another one hundred or so bags were opened yesterday, priced at 10.07 to 10.06 yuan. Dongbai sugar was priced at 16.25 yuan and remained stable. Dongchi sugar was weaker, priced at 11.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds Severely Damaged by Floods</h3>
<p>Since the floods in the producing areas, the market for Hunan lotus seeds has been rising. According to news from Hankou yesterday, the purchase price for "Chong Jiu Xi" lotus seeds has skyrocketed to 36 to 37 yuan. Although there are stocks of Hengzhou lotus seeds, the cost is high, and they are unwilling to ship to Hankou. The harvest of Changde lotus seeds has been greatly reduced due to the floods, resulting in the heaviest losses. There is still a possibility of continued price increases in the future.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Stands at the 40 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The overseas sales of white tung oil this month seem to be looser than last month. Since last week, foreign firms have not made large purchases, causing the price per "dan" to fall from the current 43 yuan to 40.23 yuan. This is because sales are usually not as strong in the summer as in the spring and winter. The reason it can still maintain the 40 yuan mark is that the stock in the producing areas is not high, and the supply from the Hankou market is not as strong as in previous years, preventing a sharp drop. It seems that there is no possibility of further decline.</p>
<h3>Metals: Garden Galvanized Wire and Edge Nails Fall Continuously</h3>
<p>The market is flooded with newly arrived garden galvanized wire, and sales are widespread. The standard price is 2.9 yuan per bundle, down another 1 "jiao" from before. It is said that large quantities can be purchased at even lower prices. Yesterday, only 70 to 80 bundles were traded, with purchases from the construction industry. Since the North merchants stopped purchasing, the supply of edge nails exceeds demand due to the impact of the floods in the Yangtze River region, causing prices to decline steadily. Three- "fen" nails are priced at 40 yuan per box, four-"fen" nails at 39 yuan, five-"fen" nails at 38 yuan, and six-"fen" nails at 37.5 yuan. 70 to 80 bundles were traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qimen Black Tea Sales Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of Qimen black tea in English packaging were active. The city sold a total of over 1,300 boxes through Tianyu, Xie Wo, Tong Fu, Jin Long, Doud and other firms, priced at 40 to 55 yuan. The green tea market remained stable. Sales of "Feng Mei Zhu Cha" from the incoming merchants were active. The market for various "Zhen Mei" green teas did not make significant progress yesterday, but prices remained unchanged. In addition, "Gong Xi" tea was slightly more sluggish than before.</p>

<h3>The World Represented in Short Plays</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Was it in *Tao'an Meng Yi* [Dream Memoirs from Tao'an] where it was recorded that during a village festival, people were sent out in all directions to seek actors to perform scenes from *Water Margin*? Someone once felt that such a leisurely yet utterly genuine sentiment was quite enviable. However, whether the characters they found were as vividly lifelike as described seems highly doubtful. Mei Lanfang's acting is lauded as wonderfully beautiful by some, yet others say they find it more believable that Yang Guifei's eyes would be less sharp and her lips less full. Of course, acting can only achieve a certain degree of realism; perfectly imitating appearance and manner is impossible. But since the purpose of acting is to recreate a person, characters that are too difficult to recreate are often avoided in dramas.</p>
<p>Historical stories are very suitable for adaptation into dramas, but historical dramas are extremely difficult to write and perform well. Modern playwrights generally avoid writing historical dramas, unless they are portraying a particular historical figure from a unique perspective. There were considerably more historical dramas in ancient times. Chinese ancient drama, in fact, primarily used history as its subject matter. Even stories that were not true historical events were often based on already established tales. For example, stories from *Water Margin* and *Dream of the Red Chamber*, although fictional, have made such a deep impression on people that adapting them into dramas presents the same difficulties as adapting historical stories.</p>
<p>The abundance of historical dramas might suggest that they are very popular and that the general public has a good understanding of them. But I always believe that the audience is being led by the playwright, and the playwright's target audience is not the general public. Before formal Chinese drama developed, storytellers had already established the format for dramatic narratives. Storytellers catered to different audiences: those who followed Buddhism had sermons, those who were romantic young men had love stories, and those who were vagrant rogues had tales of chivalry and legal cases. As for historical painting storytelling, it largely catered to the tastes of scholars, while *Hesheng* [family storytelling] or everyday gossip was intended for the general public. If *Hesheng* was truly the most popular, its influence should have gradually expanded, and the increasing inclusion of trivial stories in later storytelling could be seen as evidence of this trend. However, the name *Hesheng* did not survive along with this development. In fact, the term *Hesheng* is quite puzzling; it might not have been a formal category of storytelling at the time, but simply a kind of folk storytelling that arose spontaneously.</p>
<p>Drama, which inherited storytelling from urban centers, still leaned towards themes of romance, legal cases, and chivalry, but the common people probably had their own forms of drama. Whether Chinese drama originated more from the former or the latter is a question worth considering, but I don't want to delve into it here, as I really don't know much about various local folk operas. Only Flower Drum Opera is often mentioned, and I myself have even collected Flower Drum Opera scripts for others in Hankou. From Flower Drum Opera, one can see that the subject matter of this kind of drama originating from the common people is all about everyday events. Comparing scripts like "Resigning from the Shop" with the novels about Western Hunan customs written by Shen Congwen, one can see that those plays must have originated in Western Hunan. As for plays like "Yu Lao Si," the situations in the play are simply common everyday occurrences everywhere. Even plucking hemp or going to the outhouse can be made into a play. Simple and crude, admittedly too simple and crude, but they really do represent rural life. The countryside is that monotonous, with only Old Three and Old Four, and no Wu Song or Lin Daiyu.</p>
<p>I don't know if Flower Drum Opera has a play called "Wang Po Scolds Chickens." Beijing Opera and Anhui Opera do have it. In the countryside, these are especially called short plays. When performing village operas, the main pieces are always large operas, but the subsequent pieces are mostly short plays. The main pieces are for the gods to watch, while the short plays are precisely for people to watch, which shows that short plays are more popular. Honestly, rural people only encounter this kind of life, so naturally they can only understand this kind of play. Although I haven't seen any village operas recently, returning to the countryside, people argue all day long over a child's fight, over the loss of a palm-leaf fan, arguing with wailing and howling, as if the world exists only for these things. The drama of scolding chickens seems to be constantly before my eyes, and I can't help but think that the value of these short plays may not be less than *The True Story of Ah Q*. Someone has said that scolding chickens is a way to vent when there is no other outlet, which is certainly an angry remark, but when I think that scolding chickens is indeed the real life of many people, then it should not only be infuriating but also tragic!</p>
<h3>Quiet Feelings on the Path</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Because there are classes in the school for half a day, I habitually get up very early every morning. After washing my face and having a little breakfast, I take my satchel and go to school. My residence is about a mile away from the station, and I have to go through many small paths with green shade to get to the station. Although I always walk these paths every day, I have developed some feelings for every tree and every blade of grass in these paths. The air in the early morning is so fresh and sweet, the pebble roads are so wet, and there is no dust. If it rained a little last night, you can still see raindrops dotted on the tender green leaves, shining with a silvery light in the sun. This scenery often leads people's thoughts to extremely distant and extremely subtle realms.</p>
<p>Every Sunday, I always like to walk alone on these small paths in the early morning, walking, thinking, thinking about the things I like to think about. Sometimes, the scent of those leaves, the scent of those soils, will turn into a unique smell and blow into your nose. This smell is not fragrant, nor is it turbid, but when you smell it, you will feel a little happy in your heart.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem very suitable to walk alone on these small paths on quiet nights. It's not because I'm afraid of ghosts or anything, but I always feel that when a person walks alone on a quiet night, there are many lonely hands beckoning people's hearts, which may make you feel the emptiness of life and the insignificance of yourself. Therefore, it is best to walk slowly on this small path with two or three close friends, talk about the past, and talk about the future. That is the most suitable.</p>
<p>Many people who live in the center of the city don't know what morning is at all. The morning breeze, the scent of morning leaves, and the sweet air of the morning have nothing to do with them. This blessing can only be enjoyed by people who live in the suburbs, and people who live in Shanghai naturally can't dream of it.</p>
<p>I used to live in Shanghai, and I always got up at nine or ten o'clock. In fact, what's the use of getting up early? You can't see any green things, you can't breathe any fresh air, all you hear are the sounds of washing toilets and strange stenches, so it's better to hide in bed and recall the dreams of last night. I lived in Shanghai for many years, and I never saw the rising red sun once. Looking back now, I should admit it's a regret.</p>
<p>Since coming to Tokyo, I have regained the love for the morning that I had in my hometown. I get up with the red sun every morning, and the atmosphere is very refreshing. Walking on the small path, sometimes a gentle breeze brings a burst of floral fragrance, and I often wonder if I might be living in the depths of the mountains.</p>
<p>However, what I feel unpleasant is that I often see many small flying insects flying freely. If I'm not careful, they will fall on the spider's already pre-set web. This makes people think of real society. Isn't this society the same? There are traps and nets everywhere, and if you are not careful, you will fall into the trap.</p>
<p>Traps and nets fill every corner of this society, catching young people who are inexperienced in the world like small flying insects.</p>
<h3>Stationed in Qijiang County</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>......Miscellaneous Writings on Mountainous Areas, Part Two</p>
<p>The boredom of the city gives us a kind of weariness. Whether in life or in feelings, that dead emotion will cling tightly to our hearts. In this way, new desires will bite at us, and not only is there no way to get rid of them, but they will gradually increase.</p>
<p>However, when the fresh mountain scenery leaps into our eyes, this new gift should always evoke happiness in the evening. However, the novelty of the mountain scenery is always the same, and after touching the sky, everything is no longer worth boasting about.</p>
<p>--People, that's how they live in endless hopes, and they also die in endless requests. Involuntarily, I thought for a moment.</p>
<p>The sun in the sky is hanging on the foot of the western mountain, the trees on the hillside are swaying, and the evening mist is rippling in this quiet mountain nest. How difficult it is to describe the twilight of dusk!</p>
<p>During the day, in the great heat of June, the heat can be tolerated, but once it gets to the evening, the hot air disappears in the mountain's roar and the valley's response. That's when the waxing moon is like a delicate woman's eyebrows hanging in the empty sky, and a few white clouds float around, and from the gentle embrace, you can see the county town of Qijiang.</p>
<p>——Old Master Huang, do you live inside or outside the city? A porter who was the vanguard asked.</p>
<p>——Where do you think is better, Zhang porter? Old Huang turned over the dangerous place and asked the little headman behind.</p>
<p>——That's up to you, anyway, the inns here are about the same. Zhang porter paused and said again: However, the city is a bit stuffy, and it's better to walk outside the city tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was decided, and Liu porter also followed up from behind, running forward in a hurry, shouting:</p>
<p>——Qijiang is falling into the inn, one is not enough for two, Little Wu, Maotou, did you hear?</p>
<p>The vanguard had already turned into the long street outside the city gate, and we followed closely in a mighty manner.</p>
<p>The people on the street stood in two rows, mumbling something in their mouths, and the kerosene lamp light shone on them, and their different purplish-brown faces also carved out different thoughts.</p>
<p>The inn can't really be considered small, and all the rooms in both the front and back courtyards are occupied. As usual, we pulled the bedding out of the sedan chair and spread it on the bed. The first thing that needs to be solved is of course the food problem. Calculating it, it has been three days since we left Chongqing. The porters have regulations, and *daba* (Note) has become an urgent need in their hearts. Originally, one day on *shangjiao* [uphill] (Note) cost five or six dimes, and after deducting the expenses for eating, smoking, drinking tea, etc., and then deducting the preparation money (Note) that the porter had deducted in advance, there was simply no money left to provide them with a little better oil and water, and the purplish-brown color contained iron deficiency.</p>
<p>——Old Master Huang. Zhang porter came in, with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>——Do you want money for a feast?</p>
<p>The porter didn't say anything, and the hard-to-see dimples were now revealed. Old Huang glanced at him and said, "You can laugh when you want a tooth feast, but you can only hum when you carry things." In fact, Old Huang didn't know their pain. If he didn't do this, and they saw that he was an amateur, the troubles on the road would be enough for you to bear.</p>
<p>Silver dollars are round and white, and a flash of light will move your heart. Paper money has lost its effectiveness here, and passing travelers must bring silver dollars to set the price.</p>
<p>People were crowded around the square table, some with saliva flowing uncontrollably from their mouths. Old Huang and the two porter chiefs calculated: "Half a pound of pork per person, a total of seventy-five porters, a total of thirty-seven and a half pounds of meat should be used, each silver dollar can buy four pounds, about ten yuan, and I still have a head." Saying that, Old Huang dug out ten yuan and put it on the table. The atmosphere was tense immediately. In the eyes of the porters, they thought that half a pound was not enough for the usual amount, but they didn't dare to say it. Later, Zhang porter still spoke, "Please add more, Master Huang, they are all poor people, and they will have to rush to Songkan next time to fight, and there are still four days on the road, so it's better to carry it well." He smiled after he finished speaking, and in the smile, there was an infinite taste of sadness.</p>
<p>As a result, due to our mediation, Old Huang added another five yuan. Maybe they thought they were satisfied, and they mumbled and walked away. Afterwards, mountain songs spread throughout this long street, and the tunes were different. Afterwards, the fragrance of boiled meat, the fragrance of wine, and the fragrance of rice were mixed together, and the saying, laughing, and guessing of fists expressed indescribable joy!</p>
<p>The dishes were set out, a bowl of tofu flowers, a plate of scrambled eggs, a fried chili pepper, and a bowl of stewed meat. This was not easy to see in two days.</p>
<p>The landlady is very fashionable, and she keeps arranging things. There are no chefs in the inn, and the landlady does it herself. It's really strange, I don't know if what she made is really delicious or because "hunger chooses no food", this dinner gave us considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, the local soldiers stationed in the city checked the inns door to door. In order to catch the road the next day, the porters went to sleep quietly, one pile after another.</p>
<p>At night, the long street is quiet, there are no street lights, and it is as dark as a sleeping snake. Except for a few night porters, there are few pedestrians. Lying in bed, listening to the mountain wind and water near the mountain, is it a violin? Playing a melancholy tune!</p>
<p>Note: *Daba*——is to reward.</p>
<p>*Shangjiao*——Go up from the bottom.</p>
<p>Preparation money—deducted by the porter in advance, and then issued after the station, as maintenance money for no business.</p>

<h3>University Days (26)</h3>
<p>— by Theodor Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>One evening, a few weeks after the New Year, I heard a commotion on the street in front of my apartment. When I opened the window, I saw a crowd surging past, several of them wearing red student caps; finally, in the light of the street lamp, I recognized one of them as our janitor.</p>
<p>"What's going on, Doss?" I called down.</p>
<p>"There was a fight, Mr. Doctor!" Doss always called me "Mr. Doctor," for reasons only the two of us knew.</p>
<p>"Oh? At the dance hall again?"</p>
<p>"Where else would it be?"</p>
<p>This dance hall was a public dance venue where the traditional animosity between students and tradesmen often erupted. This time it seemed pretty bad because Doss clenched his fist and gave a strong swing, indicating as much.</p>
<p>"Who got beat up?" I asked.</p>
<p>The old man covered his mouth with his hand and whispered, "This time it was a good beating, Mr. Doctor." An acquaintance passing by below overheard our conversation and shouted, "It's 'Count Earth'! The workers gave him a thrashing."</p>
<p>This character, nicknamed "Count Earth," was a very extravagant pretty boy, rarely listening to professors lecture in the classroom, but always going to the dueling field, and attending entertainment venues without fail, rain or shine. He was one of those people who created a stir while in university, only to vanish without a trace later. He often stole the girlfriends of young tradesmen, earning their bitter hatred, but was also feared and envied by some younger students. He'd attended several universities, soon leaving, mostly expelled, and now he was gracing our university as well. At first, his tuition fees were considerable, and later, his debts were even more so, so various tales about him spread widely. The title of "Count Earth" that he brought with him suited his status, because his behavior reminded us of the old days when "might makes right," and he seemed to have completely inherited the old-fashioned young master's habit of arbitrarily manipulating the weak.</p>
<p>I didn't know "Count Earth" very well and wasn't very interested in him personally, so I closed the window, dismissed the matter, and went to bed.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, fate brought the matter to my attention again. — I had just finished coffee, sitting on the sofa reading a book discussing Roman law, when someone knocked on my door.</p>
<p>My friend Christopher, in all his handsome splendor, cautiously and hesitantly entered the room as I called "Come in."</p>
<p>"Are you alone here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You can see that I am, Christopher."</p>
<p>He was silent for a long moment. "I have to leave this place, Philip," he said afterward, "I'm leaving tonight; going far away, to my uncle's place on the Rhine: he's in poor health and needs a fellow to handle everything for him. But I'm afraid I don't have enough money for the fare there, and it's not my thing to go begging for money on the way."</p>

<h3>How to Observe the Customs of a Country?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>I am often amazed by the sharpness of the eyes of a group of investigators. They only spend a few days - sometimes a few hours - to go to a certain place for a tour, and immediately understand the social situation of the place and the people's lives. They not only understand, but also firmly believe that what they understand will not have any errors. In fact, what these investigators have seen with their own eyes is very limited, perhaps the social state of a certain place in a certain corner, or the superficial aspects of the lives of a certain part of the people.</p>
<p>Recently, Dr. Hulsmann, a German philosopher, came from Japan. This time, he is traveling in the Far East, and his attitude is indeed different from others. He took a third-class cabin from Yokohama to Shanghai. According to him, the reason why he took the third-class cabin was not entirely for the sake of saving money. He had a greater purpose than saving money. That is, to know the customs of a country, one can't see it from the actions of its leaders. One must observe the ordinary people, so one must live with them and work with them before one can get the truth. This is why he wants to travel among the masses. It is said that this time he walked from Kobe to Yokohama, lived with ordinary people, and stayed anywhere at night. The cost was limited to what was necessary for the hard work life. Before arriving in Japan, he also passed through South China in India, and his daily food was the same as that required for hard work. He firmly believes that food issues are very important to people's lives. Without trying it yourself, you can't really know its joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>This German Hulsmann is worthy of being a philosopher. In order to understand the customs of a country, he is willing to take a third-class cabin and experience the hard life of ordinary people. This is something that ordinary investigators cannot do. We are very confident that the result of his trip will definitely be able to obtain many things that others cannot obtain, and collect them as materials for his travelogue.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, Mr. Wu Zhihui traveled to Sichuan for quite a while. His trip was also very unique. He was alone, carrying a simple package, eating tofu soup for daily meals, and staying in small inns. He ran around, contacted coolies everywhere, and carefully explored the customs of the people. At that time, someone asked him why he wanted to do this? He replied very readily, if I don't do this, I will only socialize with some high and low officials everywhere. If someone asks me in the future, how much does a *dou* of rice cost in Sichuan, and how much does it cost to pull a rickshaw for a mile, how should I answer?</p>
<p>People like this can be regarded as real investigators.</p>
<h3>Jealousy</h3>
<p>— Tuo Ren</p>
<p>In the director's office, everything was silent, only the scribbling sound of the secretary copying documents on the writing desk echoed.</p>
<p>At this time, the director seemed to be silent, as if he was usually thinking about how to plan the economy. He was lying diagonally on the sofa, smoking a cigar, and his hand was constantly touching the sparse beard on his lips. His two small, black eyes, like mice, were shining in the gold-rimmed glasses. Although there was no expression on his face, a burst of flushing color was faintly revealed. It was the fire of anger burning, rising from the bottom of his heart all the way to his face.</p>
<p>He lay on the sofa for a full hour, and finally stood up restlessly. He began to pace back and forth in the room, awkwardly putting his hands in his pockets, then crossing them behind his back, then touching his beard or chin. His hands were almost never at peace for a moment. His face became more and more flushed and turned purple or cyan. Suddenly, he took the half-smoked cigar that had been extinguished from the corner of his mouth and threw it forcefully on the floor. The sound of the cigar kissing the floor startled the secretary, who turned his head to glance at the director's face, and then buried his head to do his work again.</p>
<p>"How should I deal with that guy?" This thought had been swirling in his mind from last night until now. Especially after returning from Lanmei's house this morning, he felt even more that that guy was abominable, and he couldn't wait to think of the most satisfactory way to deal with it immediately: but after thinking for more than ten minutes, he still couldn't come up with a solution, and his whole heart was troubled by this problem.</p>
<p>"He's just a police chief, and I have the power to deal with everything about him. Let's dismiss him! Let's call him and scold him! No, let's even kill him!" All kinds of measures were stirring in his heart, one disappearing and a new one appearing, but none of these were good measures. He also thought: "No, I'll quickly get her over here and hide her in my new house. What can he do then?" No, he thought again that this idea was not right. If that were the case, it would not be dealing with him, but showing his own cowardice, and it would give him a chance to laugh at him. In short, no matter how he thought, he still couldn't come up with a solution.</p>
<p>The afternoon sun shone into the room from outside the window, and the office was bright everywhere. He was tired of pacing, and seeing that it was almost the end of the afternoon, he lay back on the sofa again.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I have to deal with him somehow."</p>
<p>He shouted unconsciously, his eyes fixed on the outside of the window. At this time, the secretary had finished his daily work, and his eyes kept looking at the director, making him feel surprised about what the director was angry about today. He thought, "Wouldn't he have any temper to lose on me!" Finally, the secretary couldn't bear it and said humbly:</p>
<p>"Director; you're not feeling well today, I think it's better to go out of town to play!"</p>
<p>As the secretary spoke, he made a very quiet smiling face. His eyes, which had long been praised by the director for their observation and judgment, were flowing left and right on the director's face. However, his words seemed to have not been heard at all by the director, who remained silent and did not even look at him. This made the secretary feel the sadness of failure, but he would not just remain silent like this. He knew that whenever the director had a difficult problem to solve, he would talk to him and it would be solved for him. He had such confidence, and he also knew that the director always said that he was very capable, so he mustered up his courage again and made a second attempt, he said with a smile;</p>
<p>"Director; if you're not feeling well, why not go to Miss Lan's place for a walk!"</p>
<h3>The Most Honest Merchant</h3>

<p>Stinky tofu and dried meat!……</p>
<h3>Yuan Kang Cloth Shop</h3>
<p>— By Xinye</p>
<p>Wu Ping, Lawyer, Notice of Liquidation on behalf of Yuan Kang Cloth Shop</p>
<p>Hereby, He Yongheng, the manager of Yuan Kang Cloth Shop, has stated that due to the poor market conditions and sluggish business, he is unable to maintain operations due to financial difficulties. He has no choice but to entrust our esteemed lawyer to handle the liquidation of accounts... We are making the above announcement on his behalf. All creditors of Yuan Kang are requested to register with us within three days, and all debtors are requested to submit the due payments to us within one week…</p>
<p>One day on Xinfeng Street, Yuan Kang Cloth Shop, known for its flourishing business and solid reputation, had not opened its doors by nine o'clock.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Instead, a large crowd gathered in front of the door, reciting something like a notice.</p>
<p>Since Yuan Kang posted this liquidation notice, it has caused many people to suspect, speculate, and discuss. Everyone felt that the closure of Yuan Kang Cloth Shop was an unexpected and sudden change.</p>
<p>In the days before, the manager, He Yongheng, always had a bitter knot in his brow, running around trying to find a way to keep Yuan Kang Cloth Shop, which was swaying in the wind and rain, going for a little longer. However, despite his best efforts, there was still no way out! But the checks he had issued were about to expire soon. All avenues had been cut off, and the one thousand yuan in the savings account under Yin Ji's name was said to be withdrawn at the end of the month. The shop was empty of goods, and business with suppliers had long been cut off. What kind of shop could it be if it opened without goods to sell... These problems tormented him so much that he couldn't sit or stand still. However, although the shop was a partnership, none of the shareholders were willing to take responsibility. Even Wang Yueqing, the assistant manager and chief accountant, was a shareholder, but he wouldn't bear any burden. He only knew how to eat, work, and take his salary, just like an ordinary partner.</p>
<p>He Yongheng ran around all day in the scorching sun, saw many strange faces, and heard countless ghostly cries. Finally, he returned to his room in disappointment, threw himself on the bed, and stared at the ceiling. Anger and resentment were intertwined in his mind:</p>
<p>"Fine, everyone enjoys the benefits, but the responsibility is all pushed onto me alone!" He thought of the emergency shareholders' meeting the day before and felt extremely angry.</p>
<p>"The reason I called everyone here today is that Yuan Kang has been affected by the sluggish market, so business has been getting quieter day by day, and the shop's finances have been getting tighter day by day. Business with suppliers has been rejected, and goods must be purchased with cash. But the shop's current financial deficit has reached a dead end. The one thousand yuan in the savings account under Yin Ji's name is about to be withdrawn, and there are also nearly a thousand yuan in rent and checks issued." He paused here and continued, "I have been exhausted by the hard work and struggle of the past six months. But now I have tried every way to raise money without success, so I am really overwhelmed. And this emergency situation is especially impossible to deal with. Now I hope that everyone can work together to find a way to save this shop. As long as we can get through this month, perhaps business will improve after the summer, when autumn comes. Otherwise, I can only apologize to everyone and announce the liquidation." He finished reporting the situation of the shop and his own opinions, and then scanned the faces of each of them with a painful and hopeful look. But he saw them looking at each other, without expression or opinion, and even without a reply.</p>
<p>"Do you still want to maintain it, or should we liquidate it frankly? If you want to maintain it, everyone should contribute a little more from your pockets. Otherwise, we can only liquidate!" He Yongheng waited until half a cigarette had burned out, and he still didn't see them move. So he stood up again and asked them, but sat down again and added this sentence: "If you have any opinions, please express them as much as possible. I will accept any that can be accepted."</p>
<p>"Mr. He, I have something unpleasant to say. Since you are the manager, it is your responsibility to find a way to maintain the shop. We shareholders have already invested our shares, so naturally we want to enjoy the benefits we deserve. There is no reason to pay for shares twice!" The middle-aged fat man with glasses sitting to He Yongheng's right was also expressing his opinion, but before he could finish, He Yongheng interjected:</p>
<p>"Brother Jin, you are wrong. Although I am the manager, it is because of your respect for me, but I am not responsible for guaranteeing profits. You have to know that this is due to market conditions, not because I have neglected my duties or misappropriated funds..."</p>
<p>The fruitless meeting ended fruitlessly. He finally had no choice but to formally announce the liquidation. On June 30th, Yuan Kang Cloth Shop did not open its doors, but a lawyer's liquidation notice was found on the door.</p>
<h3>Summer Sketches</h3>
<p>— By An Qian</p>
<p>I. Cuckoo</p>
<p>Spreading ashes, drawing water, ten days or eight days of attentive care and faithful watching, the emerald green rice seedlings grow taller day by day, and the farmers stand beside them, smiling.</p>
<p>The cuckoo still calls incessantly overhead, day and night, without laziness, seemingly without fatigue. I want to say in my heart:</p>
<p>——Busy bird, please rest! Even if you don't urge them, the farmers care about their own work, their own food, and they certainly won't let this field go to waste. Look how diligently they work, rising with the sun and resting at sunset!</p>
<p>Frogs "croak, croak, croak," gathering in the rice paddies, singing songs of hope.</p>
<p>After spreading the ashes and drawing the water, the farmers stand beside the emerald green rice seedlings that grow taller day by day, smiling. At this time, the past sorrows: donations, rents, taxes, debts, and the ferocious faces of interest collectors coming to the door! The present worries: cheap mulberry leaves, losses in silkworm farming, worthless cocoons, and the hardship of a half-starved life. —They would definitely think of these things and worry about them at other times; but now, in the smile, beside the rice seedlings, not a trace of shadow shrouds their hearts or flashes across their minds. They place their entire hope on the future, on the harvest.</p>
<p>But what about the future? Floods, droughts, insect plagues, and countless tenacious struggles must be endured before they can harvest some grain from the fields sown with sweat and blood. After the harvest, even if there is plenty left after paying the rent, they will still encounter a price of two dollars and sixty cents per dan, which is worthless and still not enough to pay the interest, and there will be no good days to live!</p>
<p>But now they don't think about it, they smile, they hope——</p>
<p>The cuckoo is still calling busily.</p>
<p>II. Evening</p>
<p>The summer wilderness is both vivid and profound, and also very tranquil.</p>
<p>The west is filled with colorful clouds, coffee-colored, rose-colored, lemon-colored, devouring each other, chasing each other, a bit noisy. The setting sun has lost its majestic brilliance, leaving only half a broken and bloody basin lingering on the peak of the mountain. Wisps of cooking smoke rise, intertwined with the evening mist, forming the vanguard of the night; the tide river roars, and the small fire trucks emit long howls of joy, fully loaded with returns.</p>
<p>Looking out from the quiet wilderness: wheat stalks, verdant; rice seedlings, emerald green; trees, like (huge umbrellas, look very plump and full. The entire field seems very reserved, making people imagine the vast green gauze tents of autumn connected by thousands of miles beyond the pass. ——Yes, the green gauze tent is our weak's smoke screen.</p>
<p>The shepherd boy, riding on the back of an ox, humming mountain songs, is slowly walking home. The women all carry baskets, hiding in the mulberry fields, picking mulberry leaves for the late silkworms to eat. Some farmers carry dung buckets, some carry hoes, and some carry a grass basket of lettuce leaves, wanting to carry them home to feed the pigs. In short, the people in the fields are all working diligently.</p>
<p>The countryside, on the surface, is very peaceful and prosperous, but this is the separation between nature and humanity. In reality, the lives of farmers are miserably beyond description!</p>

<p>The weather is spring, and the hibiscus blooms. Falling flowers do not bring luck. He sighs that he has no land to stand on. He suffers in a dilapidated kiln. His heart is烦闷 (fán mèn, vexed and bored). He appeals to the heavens. His family was also from a scholarly family. They never spent money extravagantly. Why is he so poor? He does not do evil or wrong things, so why is he so unlucky? No one knows how poor he is. The two words "hunger and cold" are difficult to survive the winter. He has a thousand sorrows and ten thousand hardships. He doesn't want to be an official and enjoy honor. Poetry and books have ruined his life. Why should he study and work hard? Miss listens. Call her husband. You are, a beautiful article hidden in your chest. Your luck has not yet come, so please be patient. When you meet good luck, you will prosper. I advise you to study hard. I will accompany you to do needlework. Poor scholar listens. Look at the beautiful face. Miss, I think you are surrounded by pearls and emeralds in your boudoir. Why does your father not understand? Why doesn't he marry you to a rich man? He only marries me, Jian Shentong. It hurts you to suffer. It has ruined your life. Don't blame me, blame your father. Ma Yaocao's face flushed red. Her sad face shows her beauty. Father originally wanted to seek glory and wealth. He wanted to send me to the extravagant Liang family. But I didn't want to. I didn't want glory and wealth, I wanted poverty. Father commanded, but I didn't obey. So I married you. I hope you will make a name for yourself. Work hard in your studies and gain honor. Now you are poor, but I don't complain. I don't blame my father or my fate. Husband, why do you worry?</p>

<h3>More Than Ten Groups Including Mingxing Company to Hold Public Memorial Service for Zheng Zhengqiu's Spirit Today</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM at Shanghai Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>Our country's senior film director, Zheng Zhengqiu, assistant manager of Mingxing Film Company, unfortunately passed away suddenly from a heart weakness on the 16th. The news of his death shocked the nation and caused great mourning. Yesterday, various circles heard the news and went to Zheng's body at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor east of Fenglin Bridge on Xujiahui Road to offer condolences. Many people cried out in grief. Zheng was a well-known figure in the art world, who dedicated his life to film art and made many contributions to the cultural world. He was particularly enthusiastic about social undertakings, eagerly serving the public and sparing no effort. Zheng's body is scheduled to be encoffined at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor at 2:00 PM today (the 18th). Mingxing Film Company, all members of Mingxing Company, as well as the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Food Association, Chaozhou Guild Hall, Chaozhou Heji Hospital, Zheng Clan Fellow Villagers in Shanghai, Jushenghe Sports Association, Xiayi Society, Zhiguang Society, Quntuo Sports Association, Qun'an Yixue, Mingde Shantang, and other groups will hold a public memorial service at that time to express their condolences. Transportation expenses will not be provided to guests attending the funeral.</p>
<h3>Zhou Boxun's Love Triangle</h3>
<p>Zhou Boxun can be considered an interesting figure in the film industry. Some say that he has the skills to socialize in the social arena, and he also has the demeanor of a gentleman. He has many male friends and quite a few female friends. After starring in Situ Huimin's "The Goddess of Freedom," he shaved off his beard, making him more handsome and elegant than before. In the play, he plays a doctor who always rejects the nurse, Miss Wu Mei, who is pursuing him in a hesitant manner. But he himself ardently pursues Wang Ying, whom he cannot win over. Wang Ying was his former classmate, who not only has a beautiful face but also a clear mind. She is truly his ideal lover. But she married Shi Chao, a teacher training student. Later, because Shi Chao died early, she cohabited with the military officer Gu Menghu, which ultimately led to Boxun's unrequited love. At this time, he felt the loveliness of Wu Mei.</p>
<h3>Public Showing of "Prison Visitor"</h3>
<p>"Prison Visitor" is a humorous and revealing satire that nakedly portrays the corruption of the judicial system. At the same time, it also has many sketches of the background of a reporter's life. It is co-starred by James Dunn, Shirley Temple's partner. The female lead is May Clark. This will indeed provide the audience with a hilarious summer treat, especially since the air conditioning equipment of the "Nanjing" cinema, where the film is being shown, often gives the audience a fresh and refreshing feeling. Short film programs include Fox newsreels, excellent cartoons, etc. Below is a scene from the film.</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>"Film, Comics," Issue 4, published by Manlu Bookstore Company, was published yesterday. The material arrangement is more exciting than the previous issue. The photography includes more than 100 photos of the 24 hours of celebrities and Li Lili's swimming photos, etc. The comics include the proud works of Hu Kao, Wan Xiangming, Shen Yiqian, Zhou Hanming, Wang Zimei, etc. The texts include the works of Mr. Li Baoquan, Ms. Jingzi, Qian Chunnong, etc. The printing and binding are exquisite. Each book is still sold for two corners, and nine original 6-inch autographed photos of big stars are given away. The general sales are handled by Shanghai Life Bookstore on Fuzhou Road, and major bookstores also have it for sale.</p>
<h3>Mingyue Society Performs "Peanuts"</h3>
<p>Since this spring, the Mingyue Opera Society has begun rehearsing the grand song and dance drama "Peanuts." It is now fully rehearsed and has a magnificent, sorrowful, and humorous plot. The costumes and scenery alone for this play have cost more than a thousand yuan. It is reported that the company has been hired by the Xinguang Grand Theater and will begin its public performance on the 19th (Friday). At that time, Ningbo Road will be crowded with traffic, and it is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
