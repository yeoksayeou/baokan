<h3 id="c26">英法接近之由來 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>英國對於歐陸之政策。向來於德法之間。無所偏袒。唯自去年以來。態度漸見轉變。如初則對於法俄之携手。加以默視。繼則贊助蘇俄之加入國聯。及至今年。旣對法意協定表示同情。復於二月三日與法協調。至於斯特里薩會議。則更與法意成立聯合對德陣線。而於國聯行政院中。又贊助法國申斥德國之廢約行動。綜其一舉一動。方其未定局也。每不露聲色。若將同情德國者然。及其終也。每出於反德。似今日英人心自中對德不無若干之疑忌。其所以於歐陸糾紛比較的採取超然態度者。蓋仍欲以調人自居耳。</p>
<p>然則英人今日忌德之原因果何在乎。依我人觀測。一為德國當局邁厲無前之行動所促成。蓋希特勒與國社黨人抱定恢復德國戰前地位之决心。勇往直前。不顧一切。觀於去年圖奧一舉。巳有破釜沉舟之概。設使實力充足。益將不以引起戰禍為慮。然今日之英。持盈保泰。安能以平日之同情。而投入旋漩。致影饗自身之安全。此所以贊助法國計劃。以安戢歐局為職志也。</p>
<p>其次。則為德國空軍之發展。一日千里。去春戈林宣稱。德國需要空軍一千二百架。其後德國某半官報則主張德國應有六千架。最近希特勒更向英國要求空軍的平等權。今日德國軍用飛機。果有若干架。局外人雖不能知。然觀其對英要求之意味。可知其事實上巳有極大之空軍存在。至少亦予人以如是之印象。按前次大戰時。德國空軍。曾以比利時為根據地。累次襲擊英倫。成為英國莫大之威脅。十八年來。空軍進步。遠過曩時。故德國郎無比利時之根據地。而英德設有違和。德之空軍未嘗不可威脅英國。如由德之萊茵地帶到倫敦。僅須二小時。卽至威爾斯。亦三小時巳足。故今日之英國。若欲防禦德國之空襲。其第一防綫。决不能設於己國海岸。而必須推向荷比等國之國境。此卽包爾溫所謂英國之國防巳不在杜佛沿海而在萊茵也。蓋防禦空襲。必須有從容布置之餘暇。如防守飛機之騰駕。陣勢之排列。城市目的物之隱藏對。於民衆之曉喻。皆須事前為之。依據軍事學者之計算。對於空襲之第一防綫。至少必須設在國境一百五十哩之外。否則卽難應付。故今日法國之北部與荷蘭比利時等地。實為英國對德空襲之最適宜之防禦綫。英國今日之所以重視荷比等國之安全。及與法國保持大戰時之友誼。原因卽在於此。而其所以發起天空公約。用意亦在於此。蓋往昔洛迦諾條約。僅有英國助法之義務。而天空公約則不特英須助法。而英如有事。法亦須助英。其相維相擊。關係自極關切。明乎此。則一年來英法交誼之日臻親密。不難了解矣。</p>

<p>中央社云、我國江浙一帶海岸、漁民衆多、產魚極旺、惟以外貨傾銷、且海盜猖獗、而漁民撈捕技術、多守舊法、故漁業未見振興、今年復以受不景氣影響、更使漁業受極大打擊、現在當局正在設法挽救、茲據探悉各情如次、</p>
<p>魚價趨跌　本年自春汛漁期後、因天時不調、氣候又多寒冷、故在此時期、雖漁民盡力打撈、所獲者較之去年、大為遜色、且以不景氣之影饗、人民購買力極為薄弱、故銷路滯呆、價格不得不趨跌、去年黃魚每担達九元之譜、今年祗三元許、漁民原以春汛漁期為大量生產時期、今年撈獲旣少、價格又廉、則於漁民生活、當有極大影饗云、</p>
<p>當局注意　現在當局對於漁民痛苦極為注意、關於防範匪盜一事、年來嚴密進行故今年巳無匪踪、關於產銷方面、極力提倡合作事業之進行、指導改善撈漁辦法、蓋目前一般漁民墨守舊法、殊非所宜、將來逐謀利用漁輪、舉行大規模撈漁、關於需用經費、當局正在極力設法</p>
<p>建築漁港　關於建築漁港一事、當局亦極加注意、曾派員赴各漁區內視察各港口、以便將來入手興建漁港、惟建築漁港、需欵至鉅、在此國庫支絀之際、一時殊難實現、且漁港之建築、在目前尙非必要、當目前中國尙乏大規模之撈漁辦法、將來撈漁辦法、得以改進、利用大漁輪、撈魚產量可增、則漁港必待興建矣、故目前惟在計劃耳、</p>

<p>頗為完善　如（一）使投資人不限定資力、（二）避免空租之弊患、（三）提高房產投資利率、（四）减去管理修繕及折舊等項支出、（五）以全部房地產為個別保陣並减收原值一成、（六）無普通房產脫售之困難等等、皆是其優點、在此市面不景氣之狀態下、此為投資房產者唯一穩健之途徑、目下房產事業、缺憾正多、若以新村房產合作投資辦法為藍本、進而澈底革新房產投資制度、則房產事業前途、庶幾有豸、余意新村房產合作投資之最大意義、厥為鼓勵</p>

<p>對於棚戶　強迫注射</p>
<p>按往年情形疫癘發生、大多在棚戶方面、其原因則為飲食起居不衛生之故、因此夏季以霍亂傷寒赤痢三種疾病為最多、極易傳染、故今年决計對於棚戶、非挨戶强迫注射不可、</p>

<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>我國的出版界原來自始就不曾有過出版的計畫，全憑市塲的需要，隨機出書，這情形恰與市塲的投機相似。這原因由於大書鋪不曾想到有計畫的出書，而小書舖則雖然意識上要想有計畫，以限於資力，勢不可能，何况一般的小書舖，又都以大書舖為規範，亦步亦趨，模擬惟恐不肯。所以我國的新書業，自商務啟其端，以後起來的許多家，莫不與商務相似，很少能專出一種書籍，別樹一幟者。而以此故，彼此在市塲上的競爭，形成非常的激烈。這在市况活動時，固尙可應付，但一到市面不景氣時，却就要戚到無書可出了。</p>
<p>因為書籍缺乏銷路，於是想到了出書的計畫，但此所謂計畫者，由最近在市塲上的表現，似尙是惰性因襲的氣分多於積極創造的傾向。如大部古書的翻印以及所謂文庫之編行，都是大半依據舊有的書籍，凑合以成。這是一種因陋就簡的辦法，所以若說是欲由此以打開新局面，母寗說是保持現狀，藉以應付此不景氣的市面，還是等於無計畫。然而卽是此種無計畫的辦法，也非具有相當資力的大書舖不辦，至於小書舖則根本不可能。</p>
<p>為今之計，如欲創造新局面，為自己的營業，為國民的文化，都盡一點相當的力量，那末第一，我以為首須打破那種一窠蜂的習氣，看見一家出什麽書有銷路，於是大家來出什麽書。第二，每家書舖要能自標異點，專出某一種書，蓋凡生產事業，分工愈細者，愈為精良，我以為出版業亦當如此。尤其是小書舖，能力所限，正不必以商務為模範，貧多務得，兼收並蓄。如此則彼此間的競爭可以緩和，而有通力合作的可能。第三，在生產發達的今日，照例凡生產者必與分配者分工，斷無自己生產自行販賣之理。故我以為小書舖如欲求存於此不景氣的現狀下，為節省開支，集中經營，實有聯合開設共同門市的必要。且惟如此，乃能在外埠防止中間商人的操縱，而有利於讀者的購買。</p>
<p>至於大出版家，則我以為憑其雄厚的資力，大可不必與小書舖爭勝，而自定出書計畫，老實的說，我們現在是什麼書都零零碎碎，沒有系統地編印譬如文學，我們有一部包括古今中外的文學史與作品麽？所以如各國各時代文學史以及各重要作家作品的介紹，都是目前最為需要的。且不僅文學，其他如政治經濟哲學科學等，亦莫不如此。在縱的方面，我們需要系統地史的介紹，而在橫的方面，則亟需有分門別類地明白的認識。而這是非火出版家的能力不辦的</p>
<h3 id="c200">出版界的檢閱和期望（續） <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 葉清</p>
<p>我們不應該是宿命論者，應該做，應該想辦法改正。從根本上說來，須謀生產發達。而如何取得生產發達的可能，例如使關稅能够完全自主好給幼稚的生產以保護，又是問題，並且這也不是短期內所能解决的。出版事業在此時停止來等待麽？依然活動呢？我以為是應該活動的。這好比工人在未獲得根本解决以前，仍要生活，不得不做些改善目前生活的事情一樣。</p>
<p>而它一方面，一切都是人做出　的。在我們未明白自己的缺點，自可依樣葫度地做下去。而一經明白了，我們不獨應改革，並且也有可能。這裏是有着自由意志之餘地的。我們不是無意識的動物，我們要覺悟地實踐，追隨我們所願意的目的。</p>
<p>這裏，我首先覺得多出哲學科學書，而少出古書，完全是可能的。問題只在出版界中各方面的主持人，例如書店的總編輯等，是否了解此中的是非得失。關於這點，我想另文討論。這裏，我作為問題巳被解决一樣地看待。從此後要多出哲學，科學書乃至文學書。</p>
<p>對於高深的著作，固然購買者少。但我看是會多起來的。無論如何，敎育和生產都在發達中，只不過緩慢罷了。研究的設施和努力，也有些須的進步。雖然這些都不够，但總可添一分購買力。它一方面，少出古書，則古書的購買力便會移到這方面來。所以高深著作也有相當的銷路。</p>
<p>以上關於多出哲學，科學書並及其高深著作一事，我以為出版事業家不能完全站在被動的立塲，只求客觀需要的供應。必須明白出版事業家對於研究的人是造成其客觀需要的條件。沒有新式小說，人們只有讀舊式小說的慾望。有了新式小說，便有人來買它讀它。需要產生於有。坐火車的需要是來於火車之有的。</p>
<p>至於增加數量的問題，與經費有關係。假使上述的書在銷路與生產不相應時，亦需要錢來周轉。怎辦呢？我以為各方面的出版事業家應結合起來要求津貼。文化旣然重要，而且要謀建設，要謀復興，自可將出版事業津貼費列入國家正當開支裏面。與其拿錢養活駢枝機關，倒不如裁撤一些，把人移於翻譯著作，把錢移入出版津貼轉化為稿費或版稅以支給他們還有意思。</p>
<p>要發達文化，必發達出版事業。所以我在檢閱出版事業後提出我的期望。顧從事出版及文化的人，予以注意。</p>
<h3 id="c201">日常心理漫談 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 祖舜</p>
<p>DrJeephJastrow　曾寳葹譯</p>
<p>生活書店實價一元</p>
<p>每年，當課堂裏換了一班新人的時候，我總給他們一個測驗——關於一般的心境，使我吃驚的是，在這些正當英年的大學生中，有這麽多的人是抱悲觀的；對於自己的前途覺得毫無希望，社會上有許多事情使他們束手無策——害怕，戚到思想與生活相矛盾的痛苦，有幾個更自己深深地覺得他們的缺憾，很誠懇的同我商量袖救的辦法，我雖然也看過幾本心理學的書，但想不出有甚麽原理和法則可以帮助他們。</p>
<p>看到有『日常心理漫談』一書，翻了翻牠的目錄，似乎和我心裏所常想着的幾個問題很有關係，可是，在詳讀了以後，我是失望了，不是因為牠沒有解答我的問題，本來，這種世紀末病，不但這年輕的心理學醫治不了，就是哲學，雖然比心理學有效些，也不是拔除病根的好方子，這些悲的靑年，除非他們明白，該是他們自己做醫生去帮助人——在發見了眞正的病根以後——是不會得救的。心理學無能為力，同時，也當然不能怪這一本書。</p>
<p>我對於這本書的失望是在於他所講的話太局促於『心理學』以內，作者絕對不分釋社會組織在個人心理上的影響，以至於所成就的非常有限，雖然是這麽厚的一厚冊，但是我還是想介紹這一本書給一般想知道一些心理學是什麽東西，而被心理學敎科裏的神經組織，刺激與反應所嚇退的人，在這裏，作者平淡無奇的談着日常生活，沒有講起什麽律，也沒有提出什麽則，但你讀了以後，有許多方面，你的確可以『心理學地』了解你自己和人們的行為，你會知道怎麽一個小小的行動或習慣裏暗藏着一種很嚴重或是很有趣的意義。</p>
<p>在全書中，作者大部是在分析，而不給解答，間或有時，他的說敎却不大健全，太屈服於社會現狀，譬如他所引的伯亨敎授的兒童心理健康規律說是應當呌小孩子信仰宗敎，敬畏天地的主宰：以及解釋堂表親可以結婚時引着舊約裏撒拉和亞伯拉罕的事情來做根據之一，那簡直和康梁引用「三年無改於父之道，可謂孝矣」來主祖宗成法可以修改，一樣的可笑。</p>
<p>這本書裏有幾節可以特別來介紹的是下面的幾節。如第一篇裏；第十節，如何塡補你心靈的缺憾；第十二節，意結造成的悲劇；第十八節，强硬；第二篇裏；第十節，疲倦是兒童危險的符號；第十六節，應當責打呢不是不應當責打；第十七節，變野；第三篇裏；第三節，為什麽你要做作；第六節你討厭人麼；第四篇裏；第七節，心境與工作的關係：第六篇裏，顏裝的巧妙；第十篇裏：第十一節，下意識與習慣等。這幾節都寫的不差，但我總覺得是可以寫得再好一些的。</p>
<p>關於譯筆，下半部似勝於上半部，有幾個名辭正可以商酌，如把Forgetting譯為健忘。</p>
<h3 id="c202">介紹倍根的「新工具」（續） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 杜若遺</p>
<p>辛墾書店出版　沈因明譯</p>
<p>新工具是培根的代表作。速對他最苛刻的批評家也不能不說：「培根最偉大的作品是新工具的第一卷」（Macaulay）。在培根以前研究科學的唯一方法是亞里士多德的論理學—即三段論法。培根在這書中，郤提倡一種新論理學即歸納法，這種歸納法，至約翰·穆勒而大成，實為近世研究方法的一大特點，而為中世的研究方法所無者。培根最初的計劃，是試作一綜合的著述，名曰科學之再興，內分六部：第一部為當時的智識狀態之概觀；第二部論解釋自然時當如何正確地運用悟性：第三部將宇宙的種種的現象視為適用於新方法的材料而重新分類；第四部是說明新方法之運用及其結果；第五部叙述著者運用用其獨創的方法在自然哲學上所成就的事實；第六部則為把新哲學　即新方法應用於宇宙一切現象的結果之預測。但是這個計劃的大部分，未嘗完成。只有第一部成為學問之進步，第二部成為新工具而實現，其他皆係斷片，第六部則全未着乎。故新工具一書不過是科學之再與的一部分而巳，而且本書自身亦未完成。據著者在本書第二卷第二十一節所說，預備在本書中討論的問題：有（一）特選的事例：（二）歸納的支待物：（三）歸納的訂正；（四）研究方法因題目的性質而變化；（五）特選的性質：（六）研究的範圍；（七）應用；（八）研究的準備：（九）公理的舁降之階段等項，但本書中實際地討論到的，僅一特選的事例一一項：其他諸項，不獨本書中未嘗涉及，即別的著作中亦未之見。</p>
<p>本書是用拉丁文字寫成的。內容又分二部：第一部反駁亞里士多德式的論證樣式，又指摘向來的各種學說的缺點，這可以說是「理智的洗滌一，是「破邪」。在第二部，他提出他的新的論理學，這纔是「顯正」。故本書的缺　，實在於第二部，但第一部亦頗多富於興味之點，例如說明科學上新時代之到來及偶像論等等。</p>
<p>倍根有句不朽的標語是「知識即力」。他的全部思想，旣非這個觀念的展開和完成。培根覺悟到人類向來所有的知識，全是無用的東西。但他以為知識本來可以成為一種權力。他看到世界上現有的知識——尤其是關於自然的知識——並沒有什麽成果，而且並不確實，靠了這種知識，人類不能支配自然。故對于向來的科學，他感到絕望。但他相信，人類若能運用新的方法，則支配自然的最高權就可以恢復。不過要運用新方法，必須把中古的學說規則統統望郤，人們必得如嬰孩一般，不為任何主義觀念所感染，蕩滌一切偏執成見，毀減心中的偶像（Idols）。</p>
<p>培根所說的偶像，是指一個假像被視作一個實體，一個思想被認為一個實物而言。他以為偶像是一切謬誤的根源，而偶像的種類可分為四，即「種族的偶像」，「洞窟的偶像」，「市塲的偶像一，一劇塲的偶像一。</p>
<p>倍根的學說，對於歐洲文化，曾有非常偉大的影響。他的時代，正當中古的黑暗時代剛剛過去。歐洲的知識　增，恐怖日除；人們崇拜「不可知」的思想减少，而我勝不可知的思想加多了。一切生機的精神，莫不為一種新信力鼓舞起來；障礙物摧倒了，這是一個有成功有希望有活力的時代；各界都有新發軔新事業的時代：這個時代正守待一個呼聲，要一個綜合的心靈來把它的精神，和判决作一個總結。這便是倍根了。、</p>
<p>總而言之，倍根是近代勢力最大的心靈。他的學說是非常重要的。現在他的名著新工具經沈因明君譯成中文，使中國的學子能够直接去理解他的學說，這是很好的一件事。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c213">章友三講　怎樣研究敎育學 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>昨為中國文化建設協會、主辦全國讀書運動大會之第十日、該會特請曁南大學敎授章友三、於中西電臺、播送一怎樣　究　育學　之　　　　錄章友　之演講全文如</p>
<p>先確定立塲　文化建設恊會之招、來　自動樣研究敎育學、首先要確定從什麽立塲來研究、然後才能談　樣尖研究、因為敎育學是大家都應該心的一　　　、敎育是社會過程中一種承前啓後的工作、凡是社會中的一份子、就該研究敎育做家庭中父兄的人、負有敎育子女的責任、最好亦　得一點敎育原理、假　我們志願從事於敎育事業、那　更不容不研究敎育學了、不過從事敎育的人、還可分為兩類、一類是普通敎師、他們研究敎育寧祇須　白一個大概就够了、另一類是敎育專家、他們是以研究敎育上的種種問題為終身職業的、他們的研究、須要精深一點、我今天所講、是以專家們的研究為主、其餘的人亦可川昨參考、</p>
<p>科學的研究　研究敎育學可從三方面入手、第　是事實的認識、這種研究可以稱為科學的研究、他們的研究態度、種自然科學的熊度完全相同、其　的在搜集與敎育有關的　種事實、以作實旗敎育　根據、敎育學裏所要搜集的事實、大致可分一項、一項是屬於心鉀的、就是對於個人的本性及其變化求一正確的認識、二項是屬於社會的、就是對於社會的實況及其需要、求　正確的認識、三項是屬於敎育本身的、「就是對於敎育　實施及其影響與結果　求一正確的認識、關於搜集事實的方法敎育學里巳有很多的發明、我可以約略舉幾個例子、一是觀察法、科學的觀察、與尋常的觀察不同之點、在於前者更外精確、如何能精確呢、就是把觀察的對象確定範圍、每次只集中觀察一件事、而且隨時把觀察所得紀錄下來、自然可以精密了、前說三項的事實、都可以應用觀察法的、觀察法中又演化出一種跟踪法、這也是一種觀察、不過敎育事業的效果、往往不是目前所能見到的、必須過了好多年、才能表現、比方採用一種敎育方法來敎育大才兒童、這樣的方法是否適合天才的培養、必須等到這些天才兒童都長成了、才能表現、所以必須耐心地跟踪好幾年、才能看到結果的、二是徵詢法、就預備了徵詢表（一稱問卷）或是寄給被徵詢的人、請他塡答、或是當面該問紀錄下來、這個方法適用於調查敎育實施狀况、以及徵求專家的意見、不過編造徵詢表的時候、需要把問題的範圍和性質寫得明白、又要使被徵詢者易於塡寫、三是分析法、譬如業務分析、是把人生中某種特殊業務、分析為最細碎的活動、以便幫助個人選業時或是訓練個人的生活準備時用作參考、分析法中又包含一種診斷法、這是一種分析、特別用以發現學生的個別困難、以便施以救劑、四是統計法、一般的事實往往是凌亂的、不加以整理、就看不出什麽意義來、經過統計之後、可以看出分配的情形、明瞭其集中趨勢與離中趨勢、因而决定材料的可靠性、統計法中有一個方法　做計數法、是把某一類的事實發現的次數、認眞數出來、看他次數的多寡、以决定其重要性之高低、例如要考查小學生寫別字、什麼字最容易寫別、最好是從小學生的作文簿以及他種作品內去一一檢查、將數目計算下來、就可得到客觀的答案、五是考騐法、這方法可分兩　、甲是測騐法、最宜於測定個性中的特點以及各人問的個性差異、乙是實騐法、就是把一縣想的問題實地試騐一下、然後看其效果如佝、上面說的科學的研究方法、比較專門研究考須受過科學的訓練、要有客觀的態度、縝密的分析、於統計知識需有根柢、不僅在自己研究的時候須受過相當的訓練、而且若是未經訓練、甚至於別人寫出的討論或是報吿的文章、其中有些術語、都不易讀得明白了、</p>
<p>哲學的研究　第二研究敎育學的方法是敎育理想的確立、這種方法可種　哲學的研究、敎育固然該以事實為根據、但不應被事實所束縛、敎育不僅維持已存的文化、還要改進舊文化、創造新文化、對於未來的社會、未來的個人、都該具有一種理想、這理想如何確立呢、當然必需學有根抵、眼光遠大的人、才能够定出有價值的理想、這樣的研究、不能僅從敎育學本身裏斛斗的、必須對於各種舉問、部有潦解、尤其是經濟政治等學術、有了極深的研究、然後用綜合的眼光、才能定出敎育的目標來、這可以稱為粽合的方法、其次要知道歷史是綿延的、一切社會制度都有其旣往的源流、不明旣往、就不能明白演變的趨勢、所以研究敎育、須用歷史法、第三是比較法、就是各國的制度理論等等、可以供我參考者、均應研究云、然後可以定出此時此地所需要的敎育理想、哲學的方法是包含綜合歷史、比較一種法子、在這樣研究敎育以前、應當先對社會科學下一番功夫、因為敎育學是科學、所以須要精密的分析、因為敎育學是哲學、所以須要廣博的綜合、研究敎育學的人、旣要精密、又要廣博、美國式的敎育學偏重科學的研究、歐洲式的教育學偏重哲學的研究、其實二者俱屬重要、是不可偏廢、不過研究者不妨斟酌本人個性之相近、而側重一方面未嘗不可、</p>
<p>實踐的研究　至於第三種的研究、可以稱為實踐的研究、他的作用在從事實出發、到理想歸來、中間如何渡過、所需的步驟如何、這部分的敎育學、屬於方法論的部門、我此地所謂方法論、是廣義的、可以包括敎育·行政·學校組識·及管理、選擇敎村·敎育方法等等、這些問題、固然亦有許多理論可以探討、然應當從實踐中求貫澈的云、</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所、市面依然毫無活動之象多空雙方、亦不過少數掉期交易、新買賣甚少成交、雙方觀望檳持之堅定、數月來所罕見、而套利交易、因合息太低、且以銀根關係、不易引起興趣、市價乃始終萎廳、閃爍不定、惟九六又有無稽之謠、大都出於空方受壓迫過重之揑造、而北帮則因之頗有賣出、終未免庸人自擾耳、四月份期貨、祇餘三天、雙方壁壘高尙、斷不能常此安定盤旋也、昨日經過、市面極為平穩、開盤略疲五分一角、餘則均恍惚混沌、高低互見、為數祇在一角左右盤旋、範圍愈窄、交易愈清、惟九六經十一及三十五號北帮之大賣、跌落三角及四角半、成交總數、共計九百零二萬、而九六成交、竟有四百九十一萬、佔全額半數以上、前途尙有波濤也、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>陰寒了多久的一個晴天，快樂地給公共汽車帶到了大上海的市中心。</p>
<p>宮殿式的軒敞的市府。顏色鮮艷的黨　旗，跟柔風在高聳的旗桿上微拂着。</p>
<p>遊客乘休沐餘暇，帶着欣賞的神情，緩步跨上府前中間聲有黨徽的石階。重裘初卸，步　輕健。</p>
<p>三三兩兩的自由車。蓄意熟練騎車的年靑個子，薄衫短袴，沉着頭，一用力，車輪在周遭坦闊的馬路上直溜過去。</p>
<p>租界盛名，不差，租界有繁密的市　，摩天的高樓——國際的陰謀，都市的罪惡！</p>
<p>脚踏到國人自己設計的市中心：精　的新村，平滑的道路，嫩綠的田野：整齊淸潔，充滿了大自然的朝氣！</p>
<p>大上海孕育下的市中心，生前受砲火威脅；生後遭風雨侵凌，該是奄奄一息的。可是伊小小年紀，有的是西方民族的精神。伊要奮鬥，伊要競存。伊要有合理的組織，完美的設備，嚴整的市容，伊要迅速地，努力地，積極地替大上海開出一朵光明燦爛的花來，來振奮國人，矯正視聽。</p>

<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>去歸化城—今綏遠省會—西北四十里許，就是大靑山麓，他為陰山的支脈。山僅有一石洞，土人稱做「洪洋洞」。云是楊家部將一焦贊孟良盜骨之所。據說：「宋將楊繼業，為遼兵所困，不屈自刎，遼人藏楊尸於洪洋洞，部將焦贊孟良，八洞盜骨，並死洞中，就是這個地方。」石洞口窄中闊，迂迴曲折，暗不見底，曾有人秉炬深入，沿壁升降，約行十餘里，漸聞泉水澎湃，響如怒濤，寒風刺骨，不能再進，只得中途折回。距洞的西邊半里多路，更有一巨塚，土人指為焦贊墳。墳基很大，隆起像一座小丘陵，有石馬數匹，倒臥地上，衰草斜陽，殊形寥落。事雖出於稗官，可是摩娑斷碣，憑弔前人，也可以令人發生出許多感慨哩。在歸化城南，還有一個盡人皆知的漢昭君墳—靑塚—忠魂　骨，永垂千古，至今、永留下抗敵和戎的陳跡，却替這漠南古都，生色不少哩。</p>
<h3 id="c233">玄武湖泛舟 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<p>春神蹣跚地降臨，大地穿上一件絢欄的衣服，紅花，碧樹，靑山，綠水點綴着廣漠的空間，窒悶許久的心靈，充溢活躍精神，不忍辜負美景良辰，和洛奔……到玄湖去遊玩。</p>
<p>出了玄武門，湖邊嬝嬝的垂柳，嬌羞地隨風浪飄蕩，白茫茫的湖上，浮滿許多游船，來往如織，頭上覆蓋蔚藍無瑕的太空，與官僚氣息濃重的南京城比較，像又踏入另一個幽絕的世界，湖邊聚集成百的遊人與划船的姑娘，嘈雜聲浪，在空間劇烈波動，馬路上的車馬好似螞蟻，載了許多游人，向五洲公園飛馳，表示春光明媚，人們在及時行樂呵！</p>
<p>我們也雇一隻游船，自己充任船夫，慢慢地划往湖心，湖水淸澈，微風似在與湖水接吻，漾成起伏不定的碧波，船眞像一片荷葉，輕輕地在湖面飄浮。安臥在大自然的懷抱裏。五洲公園靜靜地沈默不語，讓人們欣賞它人工培植的藝術，臨湖，修竹幾叢，顯得春色宜人。猙獰的城牆，像一條蜿蜒的長蛇，蹲伏湖邊。遠遠的重重的山嶺錯綜排列。雞嗚寺有如聳立天際的一座宮闕。五洲有如五顆棋子；分置湖面。暖和的陽光沐浴着宇宙。給人們以無限的　存。船游遍全湖，使我對玄武湖有一番深刻的認識。</p>

<p>— 定明</p>
<p>交通發展的利益是無窮的，瑞士因為水陸交通都很便利，所以雖然介於德·奧·意·法四國間，處阿爾卑斯山中，世界人士去遊覽的，每年總有幾百萬人，所擲旅費，一年也達一萬萬，做了瑞士主要富源。這就是最好的例子；交通的障礙，常可以促成一個民族到麻木狀態；而交通便利，　可以使一個民族蓋活，充滿生機；若說瑞　　　由瀑布，明湖秀谷，在在可以招致遊客，那麽，偌大的中國，　論山：擺着五嶽和天台·雁蕩·莫干·廬山·黃山·峨嵋·等，論水：有黃河·畏江·珠江以及西湖·太湖·洞庭·都陽等；豈不能彼此一競賽麽？</p>
<p>不過因為自己的第一個先决條件是交通不便，所以湖光山色都黯淡了；尤其是風景絕佳的內地，外省人們的足跡只是零零星星的點綴着</p>
<p>四四兒童節晨，上海出發了一隊「正太鐵路獵影團，」巳由攝影家郎靜山氏臨時約了他的藝友鍾山隱·黃仲長·劉旭滄·四人結伴前往，這眞是寂寞的藝壇的良好動熊。聽說郎氏之行，是應了正太鐵路局長朱霽靑氏的電請，將特攝由石家莊到陽曲（太原）二百四十三公里的沿綫風景，輯印專冊，以發揚交通；這麽一來，北國裏雄偉的名勝，正不讓秀麗的江甫專美了。</p>

<p>從胡師母家中出來的時候，又獨個兒騎着自由車到玉泉去。</p>
<p>一進寺門，就去觀魚。</p>
<p>池中的魚，都在慢呑呑的遊來遊去。因為水很淸澈；一望見底。差不多可以數淸大魚的鱗片。大的大約有十五六斤重；小的也有大人指頭那樣長，顏色也極不一致：有紅黃的；有紅黃黑相間的；我最心愛的，還算那肥大的紅鯉魚；它的嘴最美，那嘴唇的豐厚，那短鬢在水中的漂動。它們在同一環境中生活着，找不出隔膜的瘍跡，有時一堆一堆的疊着，好像我們的疊羅漢；有時嘴與嘴相親，好像我們接吻，它們沒有爭鬥，沒有領袖，沒有侵略的行為，也不會為了一點遊人們所施給的食物分配不均而起了暴動！此情此景，怎不敎我們人類黯然魂消呢！</p>
<h3 id="c236">石鐘山與鞋山 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— （老鈴）</p>
<p>石鐘山在江西湖口縣的東門外，山頂有一小部分的石塊，若用磗或小石擲上去，發出「鐺鐺」的聲饗，和廟宇裏晨鐘的聲音彷彿，「石鐘山」命名的由來就在在此。我曾屢次拿手杖和磚塊擊打這些石頭，聲音錚鏘清脆，確實奇怪得很。</p>
<p>這山上面積　不大，房屋倒不少。有建築得頗講究的「昭忠寺」，裏百完全供着會國藩等平定洪楊之役將官的牌位，還藏有不少彭玉麟，胡林翼等的手蹟。還有幾幢洋房，那是以前杜鍚珪做海軍總司令時代造的，現在其中長期駐紮着一營海軍陸戰隊。樹木花草，却並不茂盛。</p>
<p>從湖口坐船向鄱陽湖直駛去，約莫行了二十里的光景，就可以看見一座像隻鞋子的小山，那就是因樣式而命名的鞋山了。這山四面是水，情景會呌我們聯想起小孤山來，不過高度和面積，却要比小孤山來得小。山上有僩道庵，所供的偶像是封神榜上的碧霞元君，據一個道士吿訴我，說這座山就是碧霞元君的一隻鞋子變成的，眞楚愚妄得可笑。</p>
<p>山上有極多菓樹竹子，野花遍山都是，萬紫千紅，極其好看。站在山頂看得見與雲霞援的廬山五老峰，那一片白茫茫的鄱陽湖也隱約在望。</p>
<p>據道士說：前年夏季蔣委員長乘巡視長江鄱湖防務之便，也曾上山玩過，還捐助道庵兩百塊錢。</p>

<p>— （謝名燦）</p>
<p>春，或許是秋，白鶴泉總成了每個登臨　麓山頭者的必　之地：儘　　　　　孤零幽雅的愛晚亭晚亭，多像樣的建築物和滿山滿谷的楓樹，在它周圍　　着各自的長處。</p>
<p>白鶴泉位於麓山寺後左，旁邊有條山路，地勢比寺頂稍高，用麻石築成，長廣各不及二尺，水由山腰石縫滴出，流入石井中，淸瑩鑑　，淡而有味，灣署得此，頗足遺熱。</p>
<p>這里看不見水陸洲邊一綫淺綠的細柳，這里也望不着湘江河里一片一片的帆船；兩擔販賣零食的小攤子，幾塊雜亂臥着經過雕琢的石頭，便是此間經常的點綴品。</p>
<p>泉名白鶴，其來由無從查考，不過民間有兩種傳說：一說以這泉水燒茶，蒸氣凝成鶴形，色白，故名白鶴；一說俯視井底，內現雙鶴，淸時，會為土物，某次，因進貢者不謹愼，泉水傾於中途，鶴遂不見。到如今，揆以現代科學家的眼光，二者自然都沒有它的立足的餘地。但拿它來解釋這糸名的來由，却不無價值，須知我國有許多地名的來歷，都是以這類似的傳說來解釋的呵！</p>
<p>白鶴泉是這麽單調，它的味道較之鄕間的泉水，不見怎樣高超，然無論新交舊識，一登麓山，便要來拜望拜望，固然，位置是恰鄰山徑；它那帶引誘性的名字，許是一部原因吧？</p>

<p>時序的巨輸，己轉到了春光大好的季節，各地的名勝，頻添了許多遊人的足跡。江南的春天，使人最懷想的，要算天堂似的蘇州了！雖然，杭州的西子湖也是一個遊眷的好所在，但是總沒有吳儂軟語的蘇州好。</p>
<p>在秋風沒有起了多白的時候，觀前街上巳有很多的女人穿了緊身大衣。然而春到人間以後，料峭的春風還不絕的侵人肌骨，蘇州的女子巳早換上了春裝，我們如果加以凝睇，玉臂顯露了風侵的紫痕，酥胸微微的顫動的寒形，呵！可眞是合着蘇州人的俗諺：「若要嬌，凍來叫。」醉人的春天呀！你是賴着女人點綴的吧</p>
<p>虎邱，是最有趣的地方，到了蘇州，不可不暢遊的，山上的景色，是值得人們的留戀。可是回到逆旅中，睡進被窩的時候，懷想日間的遊景：又聽得隔房的鶯鶯燕燕，反來覆去的睡不着，那時我們正要哼一聲；「春色惱人眠不得，月移花影上欄杆。」</p>
<p>蘇州的名勝很多，如天平，靈巖，天池，華山穹窿，觀音等等，一時說也說不完，很合宜一般嬉春的士女們，暢遊和飽覽春色。</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>船進了龜山渚，便能够望到一座不十分崇高的山崗；它在羣山環繞中却是一座最矮的靑石山。上面沒有大樹，更找不到叢林，牛山濯濯，禿然矗立，巖壑峋嶙，懸崖千仞。山坡下有學生石洞二個，那就是林屋洞，也有人叫它龍洞的。洞高可丈餘，寬亦盈丈，深約三四丈，然而並不見底，因為漸深漸小，故無從測其深淺。洞口頗多碑碣，多巳剝蝕，字跡亦糢糊難辨；可是那「天下第九洞天」的幾個古老體的大字却還隱隱看得出。洞內多蝙蝠，見人並不怕，終日飛翔在右孔之間。洞下有淺水，叮咚之聲不絕。相傳這洞可通湖廣，祇須全通燭一支，鹹鴨蛋一個，卽可照到湖廣，吃到湖廣的。洞的深處有龍床，石桌，及異寳奇珍之類；因為洞裏從前本來有兩條玉龍盤踞其間的。這座山，本叫林屋山，但是為了這傳說的關係？所以鄉人們只知道它叫龍洞山了。　在朝東的半山也有一「暘谷洞」，這洞高敞而亁燥，洞口却有一　觀音石像。山上出香谷劍，形似丁香草，呢淸香而甜，多吃了鼻孔裏會出血的。天下過了梅雨，那石版上更會長出一種石滋菌來，採了下來，漂去砂泥，可以作羹，其味極佳。</p>
<p>從鎭夏港裏上了岸，穿過一條漫長的磚街，站在一條小橋上，就可以看見一溜砂條路，蜿蜓着由田勝間接至林屋山脚。山南一隻「無礙庵，」聽說就是劉香女的得道處，庵裏香火也很盛，不過這雖是一隻庵，而裏面却沒有尼姑，而只有和尙。</p>
<p>庵裏東邊天井裏有一個花藥壇，壇上植着各種四時不斷的奇花異卉，靠南是一列書齊，明窗凈几，古玩書畫，陳設得十分雅潔。推開窗子更可還眺白茫茫的太湖和點點的帆影；尤其是淸晨，望着那顆銅鑼大的朝旭，冉冉地從東方的水平綫下昇起來。到了夏天，那裏更是避暑勝地，因為山上的氣候，至多也不過九十度。要是在秋天嚮晚，置身其間，那眞有「落霞與孤繁齊飛，秋水共長天「色」之概了！</p>
<p>經過一綫天，便攀籐附葛的上了山巓；平坦如桌面，廣闊像蘆蓆的石版到處都有，一座未完工的石塔，聳然如一老人。上面更有一洞，大可似斗，深不見底，鄕人燒了字紙，都將灰燼傾在這裏的。</p>
<p>站在一座懸崖上，俯首下瞰，只見山下一　淸流，沿着山脚，一直向前面田隴頭通了過去。</p>
<p>己是傍晚的時分，村中人家的屋頂上都透着了一縷」縷的炊烟，於是把這林屋山也包圍在烟霧彌漫之中了。眞是奇景；我們感到像置身在白雲深處，迷迷離離的，週遭的景物全變了糢糊的姿態：「眞美麗呵！眞偉大呵！」我們不禁這樣地歡呼了起來。</p>

<h3 id="c241">最新6G7複作用真空管 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>—全波整流與五極强力輸出管—</p>
<p>因爲摩登的收音機，要以機身巧小玲瓏爲重要的條件，所以便不得不從减少眞空管數目的問題上着想，要减少眞空管的數目，便非得使每隻眞空管兼任數種職務不可。過去的眞空管，如zA76B7和55等，都是應着這項需要而產生的。</p>
<p>最近英國加拿大無綫電合組公司（CanadianRadioCorporation）新出一種6G7眞空管，是將全波整流管和五極强力輸出管合而爲一的。預料此種眞空管問世後，一般小型的收音機，必將更有顯著的進步和驚人的發展！6G7眞空管的燈絲電壓爲636V．五極部份的輸出力約爲I．8W．底座共有七脚。該管舊名爲89RS，新近爲適合美國無綫電製造協會（RadioMannfacturedAssociation）標準命名起見，便改爲今名．</p>
<p>附圖示6G7眞空管內部之構造及使用時之接綫。H爲公用之燈絲，P1及P2爲整流部份之屏極，k1爲該部之陰極，通常代B電器內的濾波綫路，大概多接在B十的地方，此處爲减少眞空管一只底脚起見，便改接在B1的一端。（如接在B十。五極部份之簾柵極，便不能與K1直接相連。）P3，G1SG，K2等均爲五極部份之相當極，其作用和普通五極管同，已為讀者所深知，茲不贅述。</p>
<p>6G7真空管與6A7及合用後，便成一架絕妙的三燈外差式收音機。過去市上風行的小型外差式收音機，向來至少也須四燈纔能分配各項職務，至此，便可一改舊觀，一新耳目了。</p>

<p>— 擎石</p>
<p>關於變量耗阻的各種不同的用法，且把我所知的十二種寫下來。這裏所用的，最好是十萬歐姆，因爲在以下的大部份試騐中，這個數量最爲適合。不過在圖一，四，十，十一中，則用一只一萬歐姆的比較適宜些。</p>
<p>圖一——那耗阻是串連在天綫中，或接連在天綫和地綫之間，這樣就可以把過强的播音，隨</p>
<p>圖二——那只十萬或二十萬歐姆的耗阻，是串連在高週率，或中間週率放大管的屏極綫路上，這可以讓我們把正確的電壓，用在這屏極上。</p>
<p>圖三——十音量控制，（十萬歐姆，）這是裝置在一只低週率變壓器的次級上，這也是把過强的播音减低的簡便方法。</p>
<p>圖四——是檢波管中的回授管理方法，利用牠來减弱那回授綫路。（一萬歐姆）那回授綫圈是正對着那次級綫圈，而固定在機內，回授力的增减，是祇由那變量耗阻得來。</p>
<p>圖五——音質變換器，是和一只〇〇〇三兆分法拉特的固定電容器，串連起來，裝置在那揚聲器上的。當把耗阻的數量减少時，就會將那些低音調和好，那在比例上，也把那些尖銳的噓聲减少了。</p>
<p>圖六——那耗阻，（十萬至二十萬歐姆。）是裝置在一只檢波管的屏極上，這可讓那屏極得到正確適宜的電壓。</p>
<p>圖七——音量控制，和音質變換，是利用一只十萬至二十萬歐姆的耗阻，分接在那只低放管柵極的耗阻的兩端，那只串連的電容器，是〇〇四，至〇〇六兆分法拉特。</p>
<p>圖八——接在揚聲器上的音量控制，可把能力壓低而不必變換音質。（十萬歐姆。</p>
<p>圖九——亦變量耗阻（二十萬歐姆）是安放在簾柵極的綫路中，以便調整那只高週率或中間週率放大管，或檢波管的電力，那只斷流電容器，是一非分法拉特。（待續）</p>

<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>揚聲器是收音機的喉舌，要是揚聲器欠佳，任你收音機構造如何精細，發音必不能佳，故在購買時不得不加以相當留意，以免誤買劣質貨品。茲介紹一簡單的試騐法如下：</p>
<p>試騐時，串聯一耗阻器（如電壓爲交流二百廿弗打，此耗阻器用一萬歐姆，一百十弗打用五千歐姆，此敎並不一定，可以隨意略加增减。），而揷入家用電綫的朴落孔內。此時若揚聲器的綫圈完好，則有五十週（或六十或廿五週）的交流聲發出，否則綫圈有斷綫處；若除交流聲外又有雜碎聲，則必紙盆有破裂處，或震動發聲的鐵片（Armature）地位不當，應該加以修理。若發出之交流聲分和悅而不尖噪，則此揚聲器對於低週率的音浪，必能忠實發出，收聽西樂時，十分和　悅耳。</p>
<p>試騐時應該　加留意，以　　電，對於揚聲器則並無危險。</p>

<p>第一所卽是成立最早的北平廣播無綫電臺（呼號是XGOP，電力一〇〇瓦特，週率九五二·三千週）每天播放約八小時，但是幾乎全用在播送劇院戲曲，而且因爲機械陳舊，播送時，時常發生障碍。</p>
<p>第二所是英商增茂洋行的（Marconolo）電臺（呼號是XOMO，電力一一八民特）每天播送亦約八小時，這是一個西人電臺，雖然已竟在交通部註冊，但是播音權仍然不屬於我，每日除去播送西樂唱片以外，也有時播送北東飯店的音樂，另外每天放送二小時的中國唱片同廣告。</p>
<p>第三所是成立不久的河北廣播電臺，（呼號是PGOT，電力五〇〇瓦特，週率一二三〇千週）每天播送十小時，節目比較其他電臺爲好，而且放送的成績也不壞。在江南若用選擇性好些的收音機，也能收到牠的播音。</p>
<p>第四所是育英中學無綫電臺（呼號是XHPA，電力三〇瓦特，週率一一九四千週）這是業餘性質的電臺播送，沒有一定的時間，節目只有唱片，音樂，及名人議演等，現在也不常播放。</p>

<h3 id="c246">雪茄烟灰間解決積世深仇 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 峰</p>
<p>十七日國民社巴黎電，法德兩國之外交家，不久或能於會議席畔雪茄姻灰之間，解决積世之深仇云云，我想雪茄姻灰之間，可以解决積世深仇，則陳公膏的姻灰，眞可以治國平天下哩。</p>
<p>此次國聯行政院會議，雖經通過了法英意三國的議决案，但是仍解决不了因德國重整軍備所引起歐洲的困難問題，因為國聯的紙糊老虎，早已為人西洋鏡拆穿，結果一錢不值，因為現在欲控制德國的重整軍備，再來串一齣羣英會的把戲，這時的雪茄姻灰，儘管吃得多，我恐愈覺烏烟瘴氣，仍解决不了對德問題。</p>
<p>任何機關團體，祇有少數人居間操縱，絕對顧不到全體團員的利益安寗，這是集體組織中普通的弊病，卽國聯亦何能例外，所以此次大會，第一根雪茄煙灰中，蘇聯外委李維諾夫，（因為蘇聯代表首先發言）便擲下了一個炸彈，什麼呌做主張斥責片面廢棄條約義務之舉，應施於其他各洲，而與歐洲相同云云，這一個炸彈擲了下來，雖經英西門外相，連忙請李氏撤回其保留，法國賴伐爾與阿洛錫，亦從而為之辭，這一個炸彈，結果雖未曾爆發，但已驚得各委面如土色，雪茄煙灰有時非但不足以解決宿世寃仇，有時並可以增加宿世寃仇，亦未可知。</p>
<p>並且在國聯行政院會議，未曾通過三國議决案之前，德國曾發出警吿，謂如世界各國苟採取斯特萊薩會議之議决，則在國家社會黨統治下之德國，將永不再返國聯，德國政府將採取獨立態度，卽德國已受他國歧視，當須更大之軍力，此種警吿，係德國元首希特勒之發言人所發表，當非尋常不負責任者之言所可比擬，更從這處看來，雪茄的姻灰，未必能收解决積世寃仇的效果，轉恐火上添油增加了積世寃仇的報復性。</p>
<p>總之事實勝於雄辯，從前的許多雪茄姻灰，旣解决不了當前的難局，則安望現在的雪茄姻灰，能收意想不到的效力，這是人人能見的事，並且從前的撕破條約，除撕破條約外，還以暴力強佔人家土地，現在的撕破條約，不過重整軍備，藉以自衛，一個國家，而不許他們整軍經武，不許他們自衛疆土，此語如何說起，如以二者來比較，其理由何者為充分，不待言而可決，而國聯對之，亦只有不痴不聲，不作阿家翁，何怪今日國聯會中雪茄姻灰雖多，亦等於酒排問的雪茄烟灰，徒供一時談笑的與趣，不久卽風馳電掣過去而已，效力云乎哉。</p>
<h3 id="c247">識字敎育運動 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>報載上海市將於七月一日起全市總動員實施强迫識字敎育，這是值得令人注意的一件事。據市長的報告，上海三百五十萬人有五分之三是住在市區，五分之二件在租界；住在市區的五分之三，約計二百萬人左右，其中估計有五十萬人不識字，（這五十萬人是從十三歲到五十歲的）換言之，在市區二百萬人中成年文　有五十萬人，其餘自六歲至十三歲的失學兄童照敎育局的統計有十</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>五萬人，兩共不識字者有六十五萬人。！這眞是一個可驚的數目！</p>
<p>如今要實施强迫識字敎育，將上海市區共劃爲二十二區，每區設十個學校，每校分六班，每班分成年與見童兩種，額定五十人，上課分早午晚三次，第一期一月畢業，在二月中敎他識六百字，並能瞭解和運用；設學校之外，又組織識字敎育服務團，凡全市敎育界中小學校長敎職員及年齡較大的學生爲組織中心，全體公務員黨員也加入此團，團內人到人家去或出去找不識字者去敎他，再組織識字敎育互助團在家庭，工廠，或商店內，每一個單位中的識字者組織一個互助團，所有該單位中的不識字者其不能入校讀書的，就帮助敎他，使不能入學校的不識字者也有識字的機會，而且期滿不識字，究出應懲罰。！這一種計劃是很週密的了，上海市的文盲從此不難撲滅。</p>
<p>可是人類的本能是好學的，試看小孩子遇着不懂得的事物總要嘮嘮叨叨地向成人一問再問，就可以知道。然而，試問上海市區的六十五萬個文盲，是不是他們不願意識字的？他們是生下來就爲了生活給敎育拒絕於桃李門牆之外呵。如今要他們識字，他們何曾不高興，可是他們一天到晚要爲吃飯而工作着，那裏有時間允許他們去識字呢？將來實施强迫識字敎育的時候，我想最好是這樣凡是沒有固定職業的不識字者，每日酌量給他的工錢要他一心來識字，又在工廠商店中的不識字者，責令工廠與商店允許他們每日停工兩小時來識字，（工錢不扣）這才是辦法。</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>—山居雜記—</p>
<p>到這裏山裏來，是冬大；雖然是落木蕭蕭的季節，但是從什麽都沒有的都會來，使人無限興奮。那些禿頭的山木，靜謐的淸溪，我把兩個月的光陰迅速地送走了，現　已是春天了呵！</p>
<p>携着小弟弟的手，踏出友人的家，向這淸幽的小屋瞥了最後的一眼，不禁威傷起來。這是個溫馨的暖房，流浪人枯萎了的心靈底歇息地，短短二個月的歡聚，如今又是天南地北的飄盪了！從友人家直抵河埠的小路，四周被春風吹發了的山林，卽是幾頭不知名的侯烏，如今是分別了，然而相見未可期？我慢慢地走向前去，像駱駝一樣地蹣跚，想向牠們作最後的惜別，但是眼前彷彿被霧迷住了去路，我祇能聽見自己心臟的跳躍。這是新雨初霽的早晨，脚掌踩着如絨一般的泥路上的聲息都沒有呢。</p>
<p>那七歲的小弟弟，同樣沉着頭，慢慢地走，他弱小的心雪也被上離別的傷威嗎？如果沒有這次偶然的機綠，我們是永遠不相識的，偶然的聚會，必然的離別，我們就不能這樣情感。那是個僅僅七歲的孩子呵，使他懷留着或許不可磨滅的影像是太殘酷了！走到我們大雪天被小河阻止了遊程的小溪畔，我指着那帶靑松向他：那是誰家的墳墓呢？」顯然是隨意地。</p>
<p>他仰起頭來，和我打了個照面，一對黑而且大的小眼珠那樣天眞地旋轉着，「我問過奶奶哩，是一個從前做大官人家的祖墓。」他活潑地跳到我們上次歇息過的靑石上，向前作了個探望的姿勢。</p>
<p>「上海伯伯，我看不到，奶奶說裏面有個很大很大的墳哩。」</p>
<p>我也跳到那方靑石上，從叢密的松林中透進視綫去，却是個塌毀了的土阜而已。「從前做大官人家的後裔恐怕已衰落了吧？祖宗墓上的野車已是那末高大了」。心裏想着誑對孩子說：</p>
<p>「是的，很大很大呢」！我故意笑了起來，一那天我們坐在這裏以爲是絕地了，却不知前面還有很多很多好看的景物呢」。</p>
<p>「我奶奶不喜歡我出來呢，上海伯伯」他側着頭思索起來，「那天回家我就告訴奶奶，我們已經走完了山里的路，以外不知還有好玩的地方沒有。奶奶就問我那天到了什麽地方，我說前面有條小河，右手是個很大的樹林—奶奶聽了，笑了老半天，就講我聽，那是個做大官人家的祖墓，過去還有半個山這末大呢一。</p>
<p>說着談着，我幾乎忘了趕頭班小汽輪了，兩個月在這勝地勾留，我應該怎末去感謝友人的盛情呢！卽使你在這裏再站上十年八年，亦終有一天要走的。「這裏不是你的家呵」！那似乎使人死去的壓迫，我抱他下了靑石說：</p>
<p>「走吧，小汽輪已經呌過了。！下回再到這裏來的時候，我帶個照相來，那才更有趣呢。」</p>
<p>孩子聽說帶照相來，拍着手說：「爸老是說帶我上海去拍照，那東西一定好玩，　照出來像眞的人一般模樣的。」他又思索了半晌，遲疑地，「上海伯伯，還是對爸爸說，帶我到上海去，上海好玩呢！」</p>
<p>我輕輕拍着他的頭，「對你爸爸說了，我到山裏來接你，好嗎、」</p>
<p>「」那末，夏天來，」仿佛已是允許他到上海去似的呌了起來，「我們到山後去玩，那裏有很多很多好看的花，呌做——奶奶說過的哩。」</p>
<p>他抓着自己的頭磣，對我笑了，表示他的抱歉。</p>
<p>河埠已在望了，小汽輸第二次呌了起來，我就拉了他手加快地向前走去。</p>

<p>— 净夫</p>
<p>今年的春天，還是這樣凄冷、便凉風吹過，落在沉鬰的胸懷裏的，是夾着無限的溫柔的意味，使人微微的湧縐着如死水的心波。畢竟是春天的風了呵！獨個子有點驚嘆的念着。</p>
<p>這樣的春風，吹着我這樣的心，不由我不泛起無限的哀思！</p>
<p>是幾許年前的光景，記不淸楚了。可是，那春天的嶺南的風·那味兒·盈盈然猶在我的迷惘的記憶裏飄着，飄着……飄得我的心那麼酸溜溜的呢！惹人懷念的嶺南的風呵！</p>
<p>一顆無邪的天眞的白玉般的童心，在輕柔秀溫的嶺南的春風的飄盪中跳躍，老遠是愉快的，歡樂的，沒有絲微的灰壁的澄淸潔美的景物，人心喲！然而，這些是如烟如夢般消逝得那麽杳查如絕。童年的心，童年時的嶺南的風，永遠也許再無從追尋了！這亦正更令人不能已於懷的呵！那歡樂的歲底的過年過了，春正的遊神剛畢，春風日暖；靑山，綠水，柔媚美恬的配着那安閒幽在的農村。到處散佈着在嬉玩歡跳的孩子，數不淸的許多開心的玩意兒呀！日出而作，日沒而息，人們是那麽和愛親善。的快的、懷滿着希望的播了種、挿了秧，不久田野碧綠的勃發的禾間，應和着農夫農婦們那溫和的呼喚聲，樹林傍山臨水，幽秀淸靜，溪水孱孱而流，鳥聲婉轉輕嗚·溫風漫飄，綠水泛起美麗愉柔波；竹林蕭蕭然而奏；勞夫婦們停立以迎，面風吐着舒適的氣；行人飄然拂動着衣衫，閒逸的走着：孩子們望着在搖舞的柳葉，也喜歡得跳着輕盡的脚。溫柔的風，吹過這一切的幽閒靜美的景物，是多麽沉醉呢！……</p>
<p>可是，想起這張片的舊情景，更悲亂的聽到那不息的，從嶺南傳來的嗚咽的哀嗚……那遙遠的嶺南喲，所飄着的風，不是溫柔輕飄的春風了！而是哀泣的，血腥的風，獨自吹過那凄凉殘破的荒村！</p>
<p>越過聳天的高山峻嶺，像深幽無底的荒谷絕林，鑽完萬峰，始曲達鳳凰山內的嶺南的故鄉。幽然望着側的陳家花園的竹林蕭蕭而搖，無數的粉白的高房子羅列山麓，北山宮古色蒼然的秀出，宮前的松樹臨水暢茂，彷彿如在目前呵！但是，現在，火燒北山宮，松櫥枯死了，陳家花園的竹林殘落無幾，粉白的高屋，已成零亂舊落，廢垣破牆，瓦土混雜，沒有炊烟樓樓，不復是鷄犬相聞了。田野的春天，沒有綠禾，沒有牧牛者，沒有跳躍的孩子，沒有和愛的互應，聲。只有溪水靜靜的低微的，獨自嘆息般的悠流不止。春天的風，掠過那像死了去的山水，只夾帶着濃厚的血腥的氣味！全變了的嶺南的風呀！……</p>
<p>「誰不是說我們鳳凰是桃源洞，可是幾次兵亂得雞犬不安，接着土匪騷掠了多少遍，種田的又不能過活，還要遇災……完了，完了，鄉散人亡，」嶺南的春風，是變成血腥的風了！</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>悄悄地跨上了歸途，心裏就這樣的想着，想著；</p>
<p>流浪人底家呵，你是隔得我太遠了哪！</p>
<p>一年二年三年……我就這樣的流浪着，流浪着；在異鄉，在十字街頭；我以前從不曾懷念過那個隔得遼遠的故鄉，更沒有想到別了十多年底家。</p>
<p>我離開了故鄉整整有十一個年頭了，這悠長的十一個年頭中，我只在幾個都市里流浪着；母親雖然常常來信這樣說：</p>
<p>「雲，你離家已經十多年了，應該回來一躺，看看你年老的祖母；你的姊姊和弟弟也很紀念你……」</p>
<p>是呵！我早應該回去一躺了；去看看十多年不見的故鄉情形，祖母和母親想來該比從前老了吧？姊姊弟弟們見了我，也一定會驚奇一個二十多歲的靑年就變得這麽憔悴的呢！</p>
<p>我的家是在江南，那兒是個有名的水鄉，四面是水，矗立在驚濤駭浪中的孤島上就有我們底家。這里沒有岸道可通，水路也只有民船，所以從前我的不願回去，和我的怕乘民船也有很大關係的。現在聽說已有小輪船在行駛了，於是使我這流浪在外面十多年的遊子，也重燃起思鄉之念來。</p>
<p>（去走一躺吧！故鄉終究是可愛的，老家也是值得懷念的，况且那兄還有紀念我的祖母母親；姊姊和弟弟們，也正在盼望這飄泊者底歸音呢！）</p>
<p>不，我現在應該怎樣回去呢？流浪了十多年的遊子就這樣回去了嗎？應該帶些她們老人家所期望的成功去安慰她們才好啊！可是沒有，什麼都沒有！只有一個二十多歲的被生活所磨壞了底身體，和那蒼老瘦損得像三十多歲人底臉龐。—這樣回去不要太使她們失望嗎？但是又有什麽辦法呢！</p>
<p>說起來自家兒也覺得慚愧！在都市里掙扎了十多個年頭，非但一些兒沒有成就，而只落得受盡了冷酷的待遇，和嘲笑底白眼。我一想到這些就要哭，可是因爲我的淚腺早已涸渴了，所以終於沒有哭：—當一個人在要想痛痛快快的哭一塲、而偏是哭不出來，那眞是比什麽都難過。</p>
<p>十多年的流浪生活所給予我的，只是那無盡的寂寞，空虛，悲哀與痛苦；祗有那辛酸的眼淚來做了我的同情者，安慰者，然而我的眼淚也就在這悠長底歲月中淌盡了，如今是連了這僅有的安慰都沒有了。</p>
<p>「整歸鞭兮心忐忑，未嘗不思前途黑，餐風宿露忍且行，只因高堂鬢　白。一第一次踏上了向着故鄉進行底輪船；在歸途中，探首窗外，遙望着向眼前漸漸移近底故鄉山影，不禁興了「風景依舊，人事已非」之慨！便翻開一頁日記來，默默地寫了上面四句：</p>
<p>（「流浪人底家呵，你是隔得我太遠了哪！」）</p>

<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>投資百萬攝製新片　戀愛成熟滿城風雨</p>
<p>笑匠卓別麟的消息，在報紙上第一版重要的新聞地們，至少當有三四年不見了，我們在這三四年中，不過偶然得到他將攝製新片的消息，但也不十分確實。</p>
<p>此後偶然得到消息，說是卓別麟又要攝製新片了，一般的人便特別注意起來，更要注意到這張新片是默片，還是聲片？可是這種消息，不久又逝滅了。同時，又有人說卓別麟回到美國之後，又要獨自製片，可是結果他是新片同樣沒有和我們見面。最近又有一種傳說，關於卓別麟的家庭生活，說是和葆萊歌黛特Paulette　God　dard打得火熱，不久將結婚了，而且他們倆將合攝一張影片。可是這影片直到如今還未着手，我們又要把這段新聞，無形的放過了。</p>
<p>就爲了關於卓別麟的消息非常神秘，捉摸不定，所以最近又有許多新聞記者到他家裏去訪問。結果人們又知道他不久將開始攝制新片了，女主角當然是葆萊歌黛特，倘然一般的人判斷沒有錯誤，那麽她一定是未來的卓別麟夫人。因爲有一們記者去訪問之時，卓別麟不在家裏，便由歌黛特接見。總之，任何人可以看出她雖然沒有和卓別麟結婚，但現在已在爲卓別麟料理一部分家事了。無疑，她不久將為卓別麟夫人了。</p>
<p>據卓別麟自己的表示，他們倆不久將合攝一張新片，這影片的名稱是The　Mass，攝製的時間大致有五個月之久，但在本年八月以前，恐怕還不能在洛杉磯公映。我們回想起來，卓別麟的第一張影片，攝製經過，費去四年半的時間呢！卓別麟這次攝製新片The　Mass　，在他的企圖之中，任何方面，將比過往所攝的影片偉大。他個人這次在新片之中，預備投資一百萬美金，但我們可回想到當他攝製「城市之光」City　light一片時，曾費去五百萬元成本呢！這筆鉅大的投資，在他自然以爲新片公映而後，可以賺回來的。</p>
<p>卓別的新片，據說不用對白，但有音響加入，不過卓別麟本人在這影片中將不開一次口。故事描寫一個美國高壓力工廠裏的典型工人，卓別麟是一個裝配螺釘的工匠，廠裏雇用他就專司裝釘於傳動機上的職守；故事搬演下去，卓別麟因爲犯了過失而停職了，而且更被人誣爲共黨領袖而下獄。從上文所述，我們可以知道卓別麟的新片：（一）在描寫一個工人的無辜受罪，（二）在諷刺現代的實業界。據卓別麟所說，這影片並不含絲毫政治作用，而且他更很深信公映之後，能够受到南非蠻族，暹羅人，英國人或其他各國人民的歡迎，但蘇聯不包括在裏面。</p>
<p>最後，我們將一述卓別麟和歌黛特小姐的戀愛史。這們小姐，面貌很像卓氏早期的戀人愛特波兒文絲。卓別麟自己雖然對於他的婚姻問題，表示否認不會和歌黛特結婚，但和卓氏接近的人，却任何人相信新片攝製完成而後，立刻會結婚的。歌黛特更時常在卓別麟的家裏，到了每一個週末她更時常和卓別麟的兩個孩子小却爾斯賓塞和雪尼歐爾在一起，這兩個孩子，目前餘閒之時，在一所軍事學校裏受軍事訓練。在這裏，卓別麟和葆萊歌黛特是否已打得火熱，行將結婚，蛛絲馬跡，已不無可尋了！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c256">評「夜行多露」 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>After　Office　Hour</p>
<p>這「夜行多露」從取材，編劇，到演出各方面看來都和不久以前同一男主角克拉克蓋博爾主演的「舊約新盟」沒有多大的不同。它的內容雖然是空無所有的，然而劇本編製的技巧却是清麗，瀟灑，玲瓏，這些倒頗適合　主演者如克拉克蓋博爾這類風流小生，所謂銀幕大情人者流的所長的，這或者就是這類片子的優點吧。</p>
<p>現在先把編劇方法這一方面來說吧，這兒製作者和導演爽利地只用極經濟的二十多個塲面，表演了相當總錯的劇情，發揮了不很泛淺的演技。以交際花莎侖瑙瑚和某報主筆傑姆勃朗契的戀愛爲經，用湯與莎侖及富商柏德生夫人間的三角關係形成的謀殺案作穿插。演進上頗合於三幕的舞臺劇。從主筆的認識女記者以及攝影記者的三張照片到東江水上夜總會中的五個人各懷鬼胎的分開是介紹。從莎侖的投向湯密懷中到謀殺案的展開這一段，是發展也是波折從傑姆與攝影記者的再度偵察湯密住宅到莎侖的對湯密動搖是頂點。倘若在這兒就結束的話，全劇倒不會覺得缺少什麽。可是作者却以大團圓來落了舊套。</p>
<p>這樣形式的劇作，也許就是很美的了。那末藝術，電影自然也在內，美化人生的作用，也算是相當地做到的了。衹是稍微還不免有點缺憾的，是在美化之外，也無意地暴露了點紐約現社會的面相。比如富商者流的太太和法律顧問間的曖昧竟無法解決，待顧問另愛上漂亮的少女時就不惜下着殺人的毒手，而黃色報紙的主筆，攝影記者等的不惜和人拚命去採得這類新聞來增加報紙銷路等事實，也在甜吻熱戀中流露出來了。</p>
<p>跟着編劇的精巧，導演做到了很大的成績，簡單，明凈，清快，有力。衹是還未脫却許多無謂的地方，如女婢的打人巴掌，鬥拳時的尷尬姿勢等，除了低級趣味地要人發噱外，沒有關聯內容的意義。至於曠野追車這麽長的一段，簡直多餘的。人物修改描寫方面也未能盡善。在夜總會中傑姆與莎侖忙着談情說愛時，偏偏來了一對對的高貴客人要忙着分別去打招呼，這加重兩人的心理表現，也說明了莎侖交際花的身份，尚屬可取。寫傑姆兩次和湯密打架時的前三敗後三勝，却不免模糊了他的性格。</p>
<p>演技方面，克拉克給人的除了若有其事的認眞與相當活動外，並不比在過去的片子中見勝什麽。女主角康司登史培納悅，不免使人失望，她幾乎成爲沒有自我的表現，衹是加長了別人的活佈景而已。</p>
<h3 id="c257">評「瓊宮艷史」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Adorable——新光</p>
<p>關於「瓊宮艷史」，我們不能不對主演者珍妮蓋諾（Janet　Gaynor）聊說一些。中國觀衆對於她眞是太熟悉了，而她在「七重天」，「安琪兒」，「四大天王」，這些影片中都使人們流過不少眼淚，因而她的姿態，給與人們深切的印象。差不多不常看影片的老太太們，也會認得出那是珍妮蓋諾。人們對於她，真是太熟悉了。因此「瓊宮艷史」在新光開映，正可說明電影商人是深知觀衆心埋；看珍妮蓋諾和看「姊妹花」或「再生花」中的胡蝶，是有着同樣興味的了。</p>
<p>在鮑才琪（Frank　Borzagc）　的「七重天」或「安琪兒」之中，珍妮蓋諾是純情主義的以窮苦女兒的凄涼身世，博得了人們極大的同情。同樣在「四大天王」中，她仍然是同一的姿態出現在觀衆之前。但是從「結婚第一年」之後，她和被認爲銀幕情侶的却爾斯佛雷分手了，她也開始以輕鬆的姿態而出現。當然，這是和整個的美國電影之輕鬆風氣之流行有着絕大的關聯。大家都要輕鬆明快，珍妮蓋諾當然也不能例外的，不能再以凄涼悲切賺人眼淚，不能以所謂活潑香甜來逗人歡笑了。</p>
<p>然而近幾年來，她和中國觀衆漸漸的生疏起來。一直到現在的「瓊宮艷史」，不過是三四部片子罷了。同時她也不像以前那樣的使人震驚，差不多都是平凡的不能給與人們比較深刻的印象。人們嘆息着：從此珍妮蓋諾是沒落下去了。</p>
<p>現在我們來看這「瓊宮艷史」罷。首先便是故事的架空，引不起人們的興趣。你會相信嗎？在中歐有一個地圖上找不到着的王國，那邊有一個公證，突然的愛上了一個下級副官，於是便將他任意陞級。……這很明白的是沒有眞實性的荒唐無稽。僅僅是如此，劇作者以爲還不够輕鬆發笑，還不够戲的糾紛，於是又來了一個鄰國王子，構成三角的關係，使許多王公大臣，鬧着許多笑話。在這種種的笑話之下，我們除了耐著心情聽笑話之外，乃是得不到其他的意義的。</p>
<p>其中最精采的一塲，是皇帝的出場。劇作者和導演用了誇大的方法，使觀衆推測中，一定以爲那皇帝是一個了不起而威赫一時的偉人了，可是到最後出現的却是七八歲的傀儡皇帝，於是觀衆們嘩然大笑了。這歡笑的高潮，作爲劇的結束，求嘗不是精采的一幕，但是人們是體認不出其深切的諷刺意味的。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們不能不說導演Wilhelm　Dicterle　的手法純熟，這無論是在情調上，畫面上，音響上，都是優秀的把握住了輕鬆的風趣。特別是歌舞塲面的相當華麗，更使這空虛的故事披上了黃金的彩衣。然而我們在這裏是看不到珍妮蓋諾卓絕的演技了，她和男主角亨利加萊（Henry　Garat）一樣，僅是平平盡職。於此可證明，她是不太適宜於出演這種輕鬆的喜劇的了。</p>

<p>— 志</p>
<p>蘇格蘭人。本來是一種熱情奔放的人。他們覺得巴白娜爲了覺民夫人比爲了她自己還要緊。她和平常的吉普西女人是完全兩樣。他們的心裏不覺愛慕起來。那裡覺民夫人已經忙着下來問有什麽事。同時門也開了。一個人衝進來，臉色灰白地說道：「牧師來到教堂的時候，有很多人還沒有散。彼得已經把門鎖上，不允開給牧師進去。立道執着刀要他開門，但是彼得終於不肯。他刺擊彼得的時候，牧師將身護他。所以就受了重傷。他們快要把他抬到了。這裏沒有人去請過醫生嗎？」立時有十多人說道：「快去請醫生去！」不久覺民已經抬了回來，斑斑的鮮血染滿了衣服。他進了門就站着說道：「好，現在你們都來了。你們定我什麼罪都好。」當他　見了巴白娜，他便續着說道：「今晚我應該到教堂的時候，我是和她在一起。你們恐怕要說我是犯罪，他是你們一些都不知道。她是我選擇的。如果你們以爲她沒有價值，那麼我也是一樣的沒有價值。我們倆是相愛的。上帝已經祝福我：？」他說到這裏，就合了眼睛，但是仍然的續著說道：「…上帝已經祝福我，使她屬於我，沒有人能够把我們分開的。」</p>
<p>他說完了幾乎要跌下了。湯姆士把他扶到床上睡下。覺民夫人哭着說道：「可憐我的兒子。上帝不會使得你有不幸的，」他慢慢的答道：「你不要哭，你看見過巴白娜了嗎？」「哦，她眞可愛，我們已經是很好的朋友了。」那時巴白娜俯下去安慰着他，說這都是她的錯處。她安慰着他說道：「親愛的，我們幾時結婚呢？」他望着她微笑地答道：「我希望明天呢」。「那麽等你好了就結婚吧。那時湯姆士和史潘士兩位先生會給我們證婚的，是嗎？」她說着，用她的眼睛祈求着那兩位長老。湯姆士還在遲疑着。等到史潘士用手推了他一下，他們就同時的答應了。</p>
<p>醫生來了，除了幾倍長老還在屋裏，巴白娜還陪着覺民之外，其他的人都走了。巴白娜靠在門口，仰着臉，合着手凄慘地禱告着上帝。那些長老都在看着她，她的信仰心已把他們感動了。經過了一晚，覺民已經沒有危險。那裡凌多爾竟親自來探望覺民。當然，巴白娜一開門就知道這是他的托詞。她原原本本的告訴了他一切的情形。他聽完了說道：「你竟這樣愛他嗎？對於我你竟沒有一些憐惜嗎？」他和藹地答道：「現在你雖然不快活，但是不久你就會忘記的。你根本是不愛我的。」「你是要好食好住，一切都華貴的，在這裏一些都沒有，你可忍耐得住嗎？世界上什麽東西我都可以買給你，這還不是愛你嗎？」「你不懂什麽是愛情。他一切都這樣愛護我，所以我也要一樣的愛護他。」凌多爾說：「巴白娜，我真不懂你，你是完全改變了。」</p>
<p>那時覺民夫人出來說道：「巴白娜，他要見你呢。」巴白娜說着再會，續着問公爵道：「真的，這連我自己也不明白。但是愛情不是上帝創造出來的嗎？所以一個女人和別人發生了愛情，上帝一定帮她的忙的。」覺民夫人接着說道：「當我們有了愛情，上帝是護佑着我們的。巴白娜進去吧，但是不要太長遠。他身體還衰弱。他是需要你的力量的，望上帝保佑着你。」（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Report from the Magistrate of Changyuan County: Six Proposed Relief Measures; Request for Awards for Deserving Personnel from the He River Bureau <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Qi Shou'an, Director of the Ji-Yellow River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government, reporting on the successful closure of the breach at Guantai and the completion of the joining [of the dikes], and requesting awards for river workers who contributed significantly. Zhang Qinglu, Magistrate of Changyuan County, telegraphed the provincial government, submitting six proposed measures for post-disaster relief in Changyuan: 1. Of the 7,000 mu of land flooded, 5,000 mu have receded, and 2,000 mu remain submerged. Dredging ditches and roads will require a total of 40,000 yuan. 2. When people return to their villages to cultivate, they must be settled and protected. 3. Approximately 50,000 disaster victims await relief and require a general aid distribution. Upon restoration of transportation, work-relief programs will be implemented. 4. Surveying and organizing civilian residences, as well as selecting and purchasing oxen and seeds, will require 250,000 yuan. 5. Constructing crescent-shaped willow dams along the main embankment, and reinforcing the embankment with willow stakes to prevent erosion during major floods. 6. Blocking internal ditches within the main embankment. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that post-Yellow River disaster engineering work is being actively accelerated. According to the county magistrate's survey, Changyuan County requires 270,000 yuan for disaster relief and spring plowing loans. The provincial treasury is empty, and efforts are underway to find a solution. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government regular meeting on the 19th resolved: 1. With the closure of the breach at Guantai, water levels in the disaster-stricken counties are receding daily. Subsequent funding for projects such as the main embankment will be allocated by the responsible authorities. 2. The Department of Construction will draft and implement a trial method for fundamentally eliminating floods in the province, to be circulated for compliance. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee telegraphed the Central Government, stating that urgent relief is required for Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang counties, along with additional funds for agricultural loans to aid spring plowing, totaling over 500,000 yuan. It is hoped that the Central Government will allocate the funds. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The people of Lijin County have sent representatives to the provincial government to petition that the Yellow River estuary is a national concern and should not be solely the responsibility of the county to repair. The Director of the Department of Construction and the Director of the River Bureau are scheduled to investigate on the 20th. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

Each county, party, government, military, and academic sectors should jointly or merge their existing sports organizations to form a county Sports Promotion Sub-Committee to act on behalf of the committee and oversee sports activities throughout the county (in counties without military garrisons, this shall be handled by the party, government, and academic sectors). 3. All staff members of each provincial (city) committee and county sub-committee should be concurrently appointed by officials (teachers) from various agencies or schools and will be unpaid. When necessary, sports experts may be hired. 4. The organizational bylaws of each provincial (city) committee shall be drafted jointly by representatives from the provincial (city) government, party, government, military, and academic sectors, submitted to a preliminary meeting for resolution, and then submitted to this headquarters by the provincial government for approval before implementation. The organizational bylaws of each county sub-committee shall be established by the committee, submitted to a meeting for resolution, and then implemented. 5. Each provincial (city) committee should properly establish comprehensive implementation guidelines. 6. All officials and teachers from party, government, and military agencies, as well as students from schools, should participate in sports. Detailed implementation measures shall be drafted by each party, government, military, and academic agency, in accordance with the implementation guidelines, considering the circumstances of their agency, and submitted to the directly affiliated committee for decision and implementation. 7. The implementation guidelines should include provisions for performance evaluation methods. 8. Each provincial (city) committee and county sub-committee should also strive to remedy the equipment for sports activities in rainy weather so that they can continue uninterrupted. In addition to strictly adhering to the existing regulations stipulated in the winter confidential telegram, I hope that you will follow these instructions separately and report back at any time as necessary.

<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government ordered the counties east of Aodong: According to reports, the export of silver dollars is increasing daily and should be strictly prohibited. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance for verification, prevent external transportation and do not be negligent. The Luanyu Administrative Commissioner's Office plans to transfer police officers from various counties to form a smuggling interdiction team to patrol and arrest those smuggling silver dollars for export. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7:00 AM on the 17th, the Peiping-Shenyang train arrived in Qinhuangdao from Peiping. A Korean passenger and five Chinese companions unloaded 33 burlap sacks and 2 leather suitcases from the train, intending to move them to a waiting cart outside the station. Customs officials inspected the items, but the Korean national refused. Eventually, due to the customs' insistence on inspection, the Korean national reluctantly went to report to the consul. Customs officials waited for a long time without his return and opened the burlap sacks. Aside from one containing copper coins, the rest were all silver dollars, totaling over 78,000 yuan. It is reported that they were transported from Guye. The customs has already moved them away. Silver dollars are extremely scarce in various places east of Tianjin. On the 18th, the exchange rate in Tangdong rose to 118 yuan in banknotes per 100 silver dollars. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bian Shouhao, Director of the Bank of China, Zhong Duo, Director of the Bank of Communications, and Li Da, Director of the Central Bank, accompanied each other to the Provincial Government on the 19th to visit Chairman Yu to discuss measures to crack down on the outflow of silver from North China and prevent smuggling. The talks lasted about an hour. Yu stated that recently, silver from Tianjin has been smuggled out of the country daily, amounting to about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per day. The directors of the China, Communications, and Central Banks came to negotiate on cracking down on this issue. It is planned to convene all banks to jointly deliberate on strategies to prevent the outflow. Then, implement and announce them. The three banks have reached a settlement with foreign banks, and the foreign banks have agreed to assist in preventing smuggling. It has been found that smugglers mostly transport [silver] from Tianjin to Tangshan, and then transship it through Shanhaiguan. If strict prevention is not implemented, North China will experience a shortage of silver and panic, and at the same time, the price of paper money will not be easy to maintain. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the continuous smuggling of silver dollars out of various counties in eastern Tianjin, the market is circulating entirely paper money.

The provincial government has telegraphed orders to the county governments to strictly prevent smuggling. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Origin of the Anglo-French Rapprochement <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Great Britain's policy towards continental Europe has always been impartial between Germany and France. However, since last year, its attitude has gradually changed. Initially, it tacitly approved of the Franco-Russian alliance. Then, it supported Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations. This year, it not only expressed sympathy for the Franco-Italian agreement, but also coordinated with France on February 3. At the Stresa Conference, it formed a united front with France and Italy against Germany. Furthermore, in the League of Nations Council, it supported France in condemning Germany's abrogation of treaties. Looking at its actions as a whole, before a situation is determined, it often remains silent, appearing to sympathize with Germany. But in the end, it invariably opposes Germany. It seems that today, the British people harbor some suspicion and concern toward Germany. Its relatively detached attitude toward European disputes is probably still aimed at acting as a mediator.</p>
<p>What, then, are the reasons for Britain's current distrust of Germany? According to our observations, one reason is the impetus given by the German authorities' vigorous and unprecedented actions. Hitler and the National Socialists are determined to restore Germany to its pre-war status, advancing bravely and disregarding everything. Last year's actions in the Saarland already showed a "burn the bridges" attitude. If its strength were sufficient, it would not hesitate to provoke war. However, today's Britain, focused on maintaining its prosperity and security, cannot, based on past sympathy, plunge into a vortex that threatens its own safety. This is why it supports the French plan, taking the pacification of the European situation as its mission.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is due to the rapid development of the German air force. Last spring, Göring declared that Germany needed 1,200 aircraft. Later, a semi-official German newspaper argued that Germany should have 6,000 aircraft. Recently, Hitler even demanded equality in air power from Britain. Outsiders cannot know how many military aircraft Germany actually has today. However, judging from the implications of its demands on Britain, it is clear that a very large air force already exists in reality, or at least gives that impression. During the last World War, the German air force used Belgium as a base to repeatedly attack Britain, posing a major threat to Britain. In the eighteen years since then, the progress of air power far exceeds that of the past. Therefore, even if Germany has no base in Belgium, and if there is discord between Britain and Germany, the German air force could still threaten Britain. It takes only two hours to reach London from the Rhineland region of Germany, and three hours to reach Wales. Therefore, today, if Britain wants to defend against German air raids, its first line of defense cannot be on its own coast, but must be pushed to the borders of countries like the Netherlands and Belgium. This is what Baldwin meant when he said that Britain's defense was no longer on the Dover coast, but on the Rhine. Defending against air raids requires ample time for deployment, such as the take-off of defense aircraft, the arrangement of formations, the concealment of urban targets, and informing the public, all of which must be done in advance. According to calculations by military experts, the first line of defense against air raids must be at least 150 miles outside the national border, otherwise it will be difficult to cope. Therefore, today, northern France and the Netherlands and Belgium are the most suitable defense lines for Britain against German air raids. The reason why Britain today values the safety of the Netherlands and Belgium and maintains wartime friendship with France lies in this. This is also the reason why it initiated the "Air Pact." In the past, the Locarno Treaty only obligated Britain to assist France, but the "Air Pact" stipulates that not only must Britain assist France, but if Britain is in trouble, France must also assist Britain. The relationship of mutual support and defense is naturally extremely close. Understanding this, it is not difficult to understand the increasingly close relationship between Britain and France over the past year.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Hitler Convenes Party, Government, and Military Conference in Munich to Discuss Formal Reply to the League of Nations; Document Finalized and Issued Yesterday <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is announced here that Germany's formal reply to the League of Nations' condemnation of its rearmament plan will be issued on Saturday. The government strongly opposes the League of Nations' resolution. Führer Hitler has convened a special meeting of senior National Socialist authorities in Munich to draft the reply. Those attending also include Foreign Minister Neurath and military experts Ribbentrop, etc. Army Minister Blomberg is also present. As for whether the form of the reply will be a declaration by the Führer or a statement with the government seal, this is not yet known here. However, observers predict that Germany's world policy will likely undergo an astonishing development. Officials say that, in any case, Germany will solemnly declare that the League of Nations' condemnation has made it impossible for Germany to rejoin this international body. Furthermore, British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, yesterday, on behalf of Britain and Italy, re-warned Germany not to further damage the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. The German government has not yet announced its attitude on this matter. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The entire European diplomatic community is very anxious today. According to news from Munich, Germany, Führer Hitler is preparing to launch another "bomb" on international diplomacy. At the same time, France and Russia's plan to encircle Germany with military force is also intensifying. However, most countries want to wait quietly for Germany's reply to the League of Nations' condemnation before taking action. According to news here, Germany has expressed its opposition to the League of Nations' resolution to Britain and France. Its formal reply is already being prepared. The general opinion in Britain is that Hitler will adopt a calm attitude and is unlikely to carry out his threat of non-cooperation with the various international agreements under consideration. The Associated Press has learned that when British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, visited the German Foreign Office, German Foreign Minister Representative, Bülow, explained Germany's views on the League of Nations' resolution. Phipps also formally notified the German Foreign Office that Britain and Italy, in the Stresa Declaration, had reiterated their responsibility for the Locarno Treaty. Officials say that efforts are currently being made to ensure that Germany participates in cooperation on a friendly basis in various non-aggression plans to maintain peace in Eastern Europe. However, if Germany refuses to participate, an effective front can also be formed, at least temporarily preventing bloodshed. Foreign Secretary Simon is confident that Britain's peace plan will not fail, and the British people have given him full authority to handle it. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, was invited to the German Foreign Ministry today, where General Bülow, representing Foreign Minister Neurath, lodged a verbal protest in strong terms against Britain's attitude at the Stresa Conference and the League of Nations Council meeting. The Italian ambassador was also present. It is believed that Bülow asked the two ambassadors whether Britain and Italy, as guarantors of the Locarno Treaty, would consider themselves able to fulfill their responsibilities in the event of a future French invasion to the same extent as their responsibilities towards a German invasion. It is said that both ambassadors replied in the affirmative. Britain has ignored the German protest. According to news from London, cabinet members are now finalizing their official duties in order to take a break for Easter. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov has departed from Geneva and is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to continue negotiations with French authorities on the Mutual Assistance Pact. Foreign Minister Laval was originally scheduled to visit Russia on the 23rd of this month, but due to Litvinov's visit to France, the trip has been postponed until early next month after the elections of the municipal councilors of various cities. Currently, the two governments have reached an agreement on the basic clauses of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. The pact stipulates that if one of the contracting states, not provoking other countries, is invaded by another country, the other contracting state shall immediately provide assistance. In order to prevent this obligation from conflicting with the obligations of the Locarno Pact, France has proposed a method to which the Soviet Union has not yet expressed agreement, so further negotiations are necessary. According to the Locarno Pact, France and Germany agree to respect the Rhine border, but if one of the two countries engages in aggression, and the League of Nations Council recognizes it as such, the other contracting states may not be bound by this clause. (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov departed from Geneva today for Paris. As for the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, Foreign Ministry officials are now, together with Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin, organizing the wording of the articles. If Moscow and Paris reach a final agreement, the treaty will be initialed tomorrow by Foreign Minister Laval and Litvinov, and Franco-Soviet relations will henceforth move a step further. Furthermore, Laval was originally scheduled to go to Moscow around April 20th, but because Litvinov has already come to Paris, Laval will postpone the trip to Russia until May. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers are closely watching the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, believing that the organizational work is quite complicated, and the formal signing may be delayed for a few days, but there do not seem to be any major difficulties. Le Petit Journal said, "The final articles of this treaty may be initialed on Saturday or Sunday." Le Journal said, "The content of the Franco-Soviet pact is different from the original form of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The Soviet Union has concerns about its national security, and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact should console it. However, Poland should not be put in a difficult position, either reluctantly approving it or becoming an enemy of France and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union may not feel unhappy about this, because the Franco-Polish alliance has not died out." L'Économiste said, "Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Warsaw will not be fruitless. The Franco-Polish military alliance has not died out. It would not be a miscalculation if Poland made Germany aware of this in its relations with Germany." (19th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) European politicians are now engaged in negotiating new agreements, aiming to prevent the possibility of future wars. It is learned here today that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš held discussions before public lawyers, aiming to conclude a mutual assistance agreement. Everything will be modeled after the Franco-Soviet agreement recently negotiated, which is intended to replace the Eastern European Pact in the event that Germany and Poland refuse to participate in the Eastern European Pact. It is heard that the Soviet-Czech negotiations are proceeding very smoothly, and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš will probably go to Moscow within days to sign the first word of the new agreement.

<p>(Berlin) The government has recently issued formal regulations for the recruitment of new soldiers into the national defense forces, stipulating that only young men who are physically strong and without defects may join the national defense forces. However, if they are decisive, mentally strong, full of righteousness, and have been physically trained in their youth, then even if they have physical defects, they may still be allowed to enlist if necessary.

This year's Air Force Day falls on a Sunday and also coincides with the Easter holiday, so there will be a grand celebration. German pilots will march through the streets of Berlin on this day.

<p>Warsaw The semi-official Polish Guide Newspaper editorial criticized the Geneva resolution, stating that the passage of the resolution by the three Western European countries is only a formality, without a practical course of action. What was passed is only a principle, not a practical step. Therefore, the task today is still to bring this issue to an end without creating a deeper level of dispute. Polish Foreign Minister Beck has systematically addressed the unclear points, saying that creating an environment in Eastern Europe that fully benefits Poland, thereby promoting universal peace, is an urgent task. The newspaper's Berlin telegram also said that the Geneva resolution is certainly not welcome to Germany, but Hitler should be able to distinguish between form and reality. In terms of reality, Germany's unilateral abrogation of treaties and the restoration of conscription have not been sanctioned. Furthermore, Foreign Secretary Simon has solemnly declared that the door to future negotiations is still fully open. Germany should not be excluded from this. Therefore, the Geneva resolution may cause resentment in Germany, but it should not lead it astray. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Sofia The arrest of many opposition leaders on political charges and their confinement in Burgas, Eastern Rumelia, has triggered a serious political crisis in Bulgaria. The cabinet has submitted its resignation today, protesting the mass arrests of politicians. The situation in Sofia, Bulgaria, is extremely tense, as the leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Tsankov and General Georgiev, have been arrested, causing widespread fear. Troops are stationed in camps all day, preparing to deal with events. Tsankov was arrested for distributing leaflets to his comrades, defying the law abolishing political parties. Former Police Chief Nachemov is also among those arrested. It is expected that a military cabinet will be formed. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Sofia General Slavev, the Prime Minister, reported to reporters that the resignation of the Bulgarian cabinet was approved by the King this afternoon. At the same time, the King ordered the current Prime Minister to temporarily maintain the status quo pending the formation of a new cabinet. Slavev later said that he took this action because former Prime Minister Georgiev and several of his political allies had been constantly conspiring to overthrow the government. In addition, Professor Zankov also frequently attacked the government, demanding the return of the troops to their camps, so that the unity of the royal family, the army, and the state could be restored. Recently, another conspiracy was discovered, so Slavev ordered the arrest and expulsion of Georgiev and Zankov. However, this action of his prompted those in the cabinet who sympathized with him to leave. How to deal with this matter in the future will be according to the King's wishes, but the King's intentions have not yet been expressed. (18th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that the United States has once again protested to Japan against the "Manchukuo's" monopoly on kerosene. The government solemnly stated that the reason for the repeated protests is that this monopoly has a greater impact than the American oil industry in the Far East. It is understood that the United States believes that this move concerns a very important principle, which may have a profound impact on the relations between countries in the Pacific. If "Manchukuo" is allowed to establish a kerosene monopoly, then monopolies on other commodities can also be established in the future. If this continues, Manchuria will eventually have no free trade. Deputy Secretary of State Phillips stated this afternoon that Ambassador Grew in Japan has been instructed to reiterate the U.S. position to Japan. The United States believes that "Manchukuo's" monopoly on kerosene violates the Open Door Policy, and Japan cannot evade responsibility for "Manchukuo's" actions. The U.S. Ambassador was also instructed to review previous U.S. declarations, namely that the United States reserves all rights under international treaties regarding Manchuria. It is reported that the previous protests lodged with Japan by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have not received satisfactory replies. Japan only stated that it is not responsible for the actions of "Manchukuo." (National News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British and American governments have protested to the Japanese government regarding the implementation of the petroleum monopoly law by "Manchukuo," stating that it violates the Open Door Policy. The Japanese government replied to the British government on March 25th, and then replied to the U.S. government on April 10th with a document containing largely the same content. However, on the 11th of this month, the British side instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Clive, and the American side instructed its ambassador to Japan, Grew, on the 15th of this month to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota, respectively. After expressing the intention of their respective governments to not recognize the third memorandum from Japan, they also submitted formal documents to draw attention and at the same time inquire about the true intentions of the Japanese government. Foreign Minister Hirota stated that the Japanese government had already clearly expressed its true intentions in the response memorandum and believed that there was no need for any changes. However, if British and American oil merchants wish to substantively negotiate with "Manchukuo," Japan would not hesitate to act as an intermediary. Therefore, the position of the Japanese government was solemnly clarified orally, and Japan's position was explained. (Nippon Rengo dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain has decided to stipulate new tax rates for grains, rice, and soybeans in the next budget, increasing import tariffs on grains, rice, and soybeans imported from Manchuria. It is reported that this measure is based on the recommendations of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and in response to requests from the British West Indies and Ceylon. Since the increase in imports of grains, rice, and soybeans produced in Manchuria, the import of similar goods from the West Indies and Ceylon to the United Kingdom has greatly decreased. Therefore, the West Indies and Ceylon specifically requested the British government to provide assistance in order to develop the colonies' exports to the United Kingdom. At the same time, it is permitted to restrict the import quota of Japanese cotton cloth in the two colonies, so as to increase the import of British goods. (Havas dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Despite strong opposition from the American people, the U.S. Navy is determined to be active in the North Pacific and conduct large-scale naval exercises in the area. This is a free action of the U.S. Navy. Although the Japanese Navy absolutely avoids criticism, it attaches great importance to this matter from the following perspectives: The northern end of the U.S. Navy's exercise area, Attu Island, is only 700 nautical miles from the northern end of the Japanese Kuril Islands and only 1,700 nautical miles from the base of the Northern Army in Tatzihaba. Starting exercises so close to Japanese territory and bases is no different from Japan establishing a base in the Marshall Islands and starting exercises. If Japan were to conduct exercises in this way, it is questionable whether the United States would be stimulated. Therefore, the U.S. Navy's exercise this time may not make the Japanese Navy nervous, and it cannot but doubt the true intention of the U.S. Navy. (Den Tsushin dispatch of the 19th)</p>

In addition, according to the Ministry of Communications, this air route has a lot of military significance. The Shmidta Peninsula is very close to U.S. Alaska. There is already an air route between New York and Alaska, so the Soviet Union's new air route can connect with Alaska and New York. (Hua Lian dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Pan American Airways' plan to fly across the Pacific Ocean to connect U.S. and Asian aviation has now achieved success in the first step of connecting San Francisco and Hawaii. In terms of the U.S. Far East aviation policy, it can be said to have established a major foundation, arousing attention from all sides. Wake Island is a restricted defense area stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty, and the airfield established by Pan American Airways is located there. Since Wake Island is U.S. territory and the airfield is for commercial aircraft, it should not have any military significance. If according to the U.S. side's opinion, Japan has no need to criticize it. However, the company planning U.S.-Asia connection has not mentioned anything about Japan-U.S. aviation connection in advance. Given the current state of Japan-U.S. transportation, this fact has to be considered an unexpected situation. The section of the air route from San Francisco to Manila is close to the Sea of Japan and flies across Japan's South Seas Mandate Territory. It is extremely unpleasant that it is being constructed without any contact with Japan. Therefore, from the perspective of Japan-U.S. relations centered on Pacific transportation, it is necessary to express regret. (Nippon Rengo dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today overwhelmingly rejected Townsend's proposed old-age pension plan. According to this plan, anyone over the age of sixty would receive a pension of $200 per month. This money would be raised by levying a 2% tax on any business. People consider this plan purely ideal and not feasible. The authorities also opposed it, so the plan was eventually rejected. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Northwest Inspection Notes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— By our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Changwu County, a Vital Point in Gansu and Shaanxi</p>
<p>Seventeen kilometers east of Pingliang is a town called Sishilipu, with a large population. Several dozen small carts come and go. Thirteen kilometers further is Baishui, also with a considerable population. There is a newly built old-style theater stage, with elaborate oil paintings. Another ten kilometers leads to Wangcun. Along the southern foothills, a new road is being built, but it is not yet completed. The Jing River meanders like a ring and must be crossed by wading. Fifteen kilometers away is Jingchuan, where the Rui River flows south to join the Jing. A mountain juts out at the confluence of the Jing and Rui, about thirty meters high, forming a triangle. A solitary tree grows at the top, and two or three temples are built in the middle. One is a three-story building called the Western Queen Mother Temple. At the foot of the mountain is a stone tablet inscribed "Ancient Yaochi, where the Queen Mother descended." Legend has it that King Mu of Zhou drove his eight steeds to meet the Western Queen Mother at Yaochi, which is this place. Crossing the Rui River eastward, one finds the Jingchuan public sports field, located in a willow grove by the water, with beautiful scenery. Passing the field is the west gate of Jingcheng. The road is not yet open to traffic, and only the city defense soldiers (belonging to the 61st Division) can be seen, holding sharp scissors to wait for the locals. When they encounter someone with a queue, they laugh and cut it off, saying, "It's been how many years of the Republic, and you still haven't cut your queue!" If someone is unwilling to cut it, the officials politely persuade them, and eventually they cut it off as well. It is said that several hundred queues are cut off daily in the four cities. The custom of keeping queues is even more prevalent in the west than in the east. If this practice can be followed, the backward custom can be eliminated. Jingcheng is strategically important. During the confrontation between the Song Dynasty and Western Xia, and during Zuo Zongtang's suppression of the Tongzhi Rebellion, it served as a base. It was also at Jingzhou Slope east of the city that Guo Ziyi single-handedly met with the Uyghur chieftain.</p>
<p>Leaving Jingcheng to the east, newly planted roadside willows, barely thick enough to encircle with one's hands, are lovely. Since Wating, the road has run alongside the Jing River, with cave dwellings visible on the mountains on both sides. Suddenly, the road veers away from the river, winding uphill to a flat plateau. We passed through a narrow road with deep pits and sheer cliffs, just wide enough for one vehicle to pass. Although there were protective walls on both sides, they seemed bottomless, causing anxiety. Twenty-two kilometers away is Gaozhen, and fourteen kilometers further is Yaodian, both small towns in Jingchuan where food and lodging are available. The border of Gansu Province ends at Yaodian. From Lanzhou to here, the total distance is more than four hundred and ninety kilometers. The mountains are layered and the road winds and turns, and it rained, so it took four and a half days to travel. Thirty li east of Yaodian, we entered the territory of Shaanxi and arrived at Changwu City. It was already dusk, and we stayed at the West Gate. We visited the county magistrate, Dang Bohu. According to him, the county covers an area of seventy li from east to west and eighty li from north to south, totaling more than fifty thousand square li, mostly plains. The county government collects a total of twenty-four thousand yuan in regular and additional taxes annually. The Jing River can naturally irrigate a portion of the fields, and the Guangren Canal can also irrigate more than five hundred mu. One landlord owns fifteen qing of land, and about thirty families own five or six qing, while the rest own dozens of mu. Tenant farmers account for only ten percent of the population, so there are few disputes over rent. The agricultural products are wheat and miscellaneous grains. Animal husbandry is also practiced on the slopes. There is a surplus of miscellaneous grains for self-sufficiency, but not enough wheat. It is commonly said that the surplus grain can be transported to Qianzhou and Liquan, but in reality, it is imported from Lingtai and Jingchuan in Gansu. Shaanxi Province is implementing a smoking ban, dividing the area into zones with deadlines. Changyi is scheduled to ban it completely by the end of this year. Cotton cultivation was first promoted last year, with good results. Sideline occupations for farmers include raising pigs and sheep. They drive them to Li Quan in herds of a hundred or more. The three types of wood – poplar, ailanthus, and tung – are also exported to other counties annually. In the early years of the Republic, Japanese merchants came to Chang in droves to buy tung wood specifically for making wooden clogs. In terms of school education, there is one higher primary school with more than seventy students, eighty-one primary schools with a total of more than two thousand four hundred students, and one private Zhaoren Primary School, founded by the county magistrate and various bureau chiefs, who also serve as teachers and are quite spirited. The people are simple and honest, but the atmosphere is not open. Foot binding for women and queue-keeping for men are common in the countryside. It is said that these customs will be thoroughly eliminated after the reorganization of the Baojia system.</p>
<p>The city is three li in circumference, with a moat about three zhang deep. To the southeast is an open plain, and to the northwest is a large valley. Therefore, there is a moat to the southeast but not to the northwest. There is a spring in the north city, emerging from under the city wall, which never dries up even in extreme drought. It is called Xiushui, and residents draw water from it. Although Changwu has a small population and lacks commercial prosperity, Shaanxi's tax collection agencies and highway stations are located here. Whenever there is trouble in the Central Plains, it is easily captured and becomes a battlefield. The Tang Dynasty established Zhaoren Temple to commemorate the fallen soldiers. Li Hua wrote an essay lamenting the ancient battlefields, and Ran Dian Town, where the Shaanxi-Gansu armies fought fiercely during the Xinhai Revolution, is also located in the county. At the end of January this spring, a group led by Liu Zidan suddenly led hundreds of cavalry to attack the county seat. County Magistrate Dang led the militia in street fighting for two hours before repelling them. Fortunately, the area was not devastated. Changwu is located on a plateau and is a vital point for transportation between Shaanxi and Gansu. As the saying goes, it is a place that must be contested for both offense and defense, as it has been throughout history.</p>
<p>The living conditions of the people are slightly better than in Gansu, as the Central Army was stationed here earlier and did not arbitrarily impose corvée and taxes like the mixed troops in Gansu. The tobacco tax of ten yuan per mu (last year, Chang County collected more than fourteen thousand yuan, all of which was handed over to the Shaanxi Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee) is paid by those who have obtained permits and actually cultivate tobacco. This is different from Gansu and Ningxia provinces, where taxes are levied on a per-mu basis regardless of whether tobacco is cultivated or not, causing farmers to lament that their land is a burden. In Chang County, one yuan can buy fifty jin of wheat flour, five or six jin of meat, and ten jin of salt. Most people can afford wheat flour, but fewer than one in a hundred can afford meat. Even having salt to eat and wearing cotton clothes in winter is only possible for half of the population. Boys and girls aged thirteen or fourteen are almost entirely without trousers. However, this situation is not unique to one place. Almost all rural areas affected by foreign economic invasion and domestic natural and man-made disasters are facing a tragic scene of hunger and cold.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Zhang Xueliang Returns to Hankou: Two Meetings with Liu Xiang and He Guoguang in Chongqing; Progress in Bandit Suppression and Political Improvement in Sichuan and Guizhou <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Chairman's Headquarters of the Military Commission, flew to Guizhou on the 13th to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on important matters. While en route to the Sichuan-Guizhou border, the plane was forced to turn back and land in Chongqing due to fog. That evening, he met with Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Province, and He Guoguang, Director of the Staff Group stationed in Sichuan, and others. On the 14th, he flew south again on the original plane, arriving in Guiyang at noon. By then, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had returned to Guiyang from Kunming. After Zhang's arrival, he immediately went to the headquarters to pay his respects and report on the situation of the suppression and reconstruction in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and to seek instructions. On the 16th, Zhang flew from Guiyang to Chongqing with Zhang Jiluan, Editor-in-Chief of the Tianjin Dagongbao, for official business, and met with Liu Xiang, He Guoguang, and others again. On the 17th, they flew east together, arriving in Hankou at noon and returning to Wuchang. Under the command of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces are making substantial progress. The defense of the Fujiang River is extremely solid. Zitong and Jiangyou are still in the hands of Deng Xihou's forces. Although the bandits have launched repeated fierce attacks, they have all failed. It is said that the bandits have suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, the Feng Brigade of the Deng Army stationed in Guangyuan has captured Chaotian Pass. Hu Zongnan's division has also captured Shenshengyi and is in contact with Deng's army for joint suppression. The bandits in Guizhou have been wiped out near Guiyang, and their strength has been reduced by seventy to eighty percent. Their elimination is only a matter of time. With Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, the politics of Guizhou Province have also been improved. Wang Jialie's resignation as Chairman of the province has been approved, and he will now specialize in military affairs. The Central Government has appointed Wu Zhongxin as his successor. Wu recently paid his respects to Chiang and then passed through Hankou to go to Beijing. He will soon pass through Hankou again to go to Guiyang to take office. In terms of finance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed Wang Cheng-ying to go and reorganize it. Wang flew from Hankou to Chongqing on the 17th and then took a military plane to Guizhou to pay his respects. The China Farmers Bank has also sent Wang Jue to Guizhou to prepare for the establishment of a branch, which is scheduled to open on May 1st. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">May 2nd: Jing-Wu Railway Opens to Traffic; Fourth-Class Cars to Open First on April 21st; Connection with Jing-Hu Railway within Three Months <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Jing-Wu Railway, built by the Jiangnan Railway Company, has been actively rushed to completion. Due to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram ordering that it be connected to the Jing-Hu Railway within three months, the track laying work for the entire line has now reached the outskirts of Beijing. In addition to the section between Wuhu and Dangtu, which was opened to traffic and passengers on March 22nd, it has now been decided to open direct fourth-class passenger cars on the entire Jing-Wu line on the 21st of this month to facilitate passengers and merchants. There will be four round trips per day. However, due to the new construction, the roadbed may not be completely stable, so the travel time will be slightly extended to four hours. Once the ballast is thickened, the speed will be increased, and it will take about two and a half hours. The fare for the entire fourth-class trip is set at seven corners, which is only a quarter of the price of 2.60 yuan for a long-distance bus on the Jing-Wu highway. The Jing-Wu Motor Transport Company will suffer a major blow as a result. In order to maintain its business, the company has obtained approval from the Jiangsu and Anhui provincial construction departments to reduce fares at all stations along the line by 30% from April 21st. However, with more frequent bus services, it may still be able to survive. The thirteen new locomotives ordered by the Jiangnan Company in England have already arrived in Shanghai, and the first, second, and third class passenger cars ordered in Shanghai will be shipped to Wuhu soon. Therefore, it is scheduled to open all classes of passenger cars on May 2nd. The Nanjing connection station has been selected at Honghuadi (i.e., Guanyin'an), and construction is planned. In Beijing, three branch stations will be set up at Zhonghuamen, Xinjiekou, and Xiaguan. As for the issue of connecting with the Jing-Hu Railway, personnel have been dispatched to Beijing to negotiate, and it should be possible to meet the deadline within three months. It is decided that a test run will be held tomorrow (the 19th). A special train will depart from Wuhu at 11:00 a.m., arriving at Zhonghuamen in Beijing at approximately 3:00 p.m. It will then be tested on the return trip to Wuhu that day. In addition, the Wuhu-Xuan and Xuan-Sun sections of the company have long been officially open to traffic. As it is now the time when tea from the Xuanhui area is being marketed, the number of merchants transporting tea to North China is the highest. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and the export of Hui tea was extremely difficult and expensive. In order to facilitate tea merchants, special joint transportation arrangements have been made with the Jing-Hu and Pu-Jin lines. Tea merchants are spared the trouble of transshipment midway, and the cost savings are even greater, which is welcomed by all. Several thousand merchants have already delivered tea in recent days. Before the Jing-Wu section is officially open to traffic, tea will be transported to Dangtu and then by bus. However, in a week, Sunjiabu to Nanjing will be completely directly accessible. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Upstream of the Yellow River in Shandong: Sudden Rise in the Kangtun People's Embankment Due to Influence After the Guantai Confluence <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The breach at the Guantai mouth of the Yellow River has been blocked by personnel dispatched by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission after several weeks of efforts. The water level in Changyuan and Puyang has dropped, and planting is hopeful. The Yellow River still flows down the old course of the people's embankment. However, because the breach has been blocked, the river works in Shandong Province have been affected. In recent days, the water level of the Kangtun people's embankment in Juancheng upstream has risen sharply and uncontrollably. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau has reported this and telegraphed the section to pay close attention. The spring embankment project of the Yellow River in Shandong requires a total of more than 299,000 yuan, which the Finance Department has already allocated. The River Affairs Bureau has purchased straw and is preparing flood defenses, which are now largely completed. The materials and labor for flood prevention have been prepared. The River Affairs Bureau previously sent Zhao Luren, the section chief of the General Affairs Section, to the downstream to inspect the straw materials. Zhao returned to Jinan yesterday and will soon go to the upstream of the Yellow River to inspect the materials and labor for flood prevention. After the inspection is completed, the provincial government will be requested to send personnel to inspect. Furthermore, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is now concerned that the flood season is approaching and that the defense of the Yellow River is of utmost importance. Shandong is the downstream of the Yellow River, and the matter is of particular importance. It has sent a letter to the provincial government instructing the River Affairs Bureau to report on the flood prevention situation this year. The bureau received the order and immediately reported the preparations for flood prevention to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. (17th)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Jingdezhen: Abolition of Kiln Prohibition in the Porcelain Industry <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jingdezhen is one of China's four famous towns, and its main product is porcelain. At the same time, it is known throughout the world for its porcelain and once occupied the most glorious and indelible page in the history of world industry. This cannot be denied by people all over the world. However, in recent years, it has completely lost its former glory and entered a path of decline and decay. The reasons for its failure are due to objective circumstances, but also to the conservatism of the workers, who do not know how to improve, the division of factions, and the failure to merge, and ignorance of the world trend. Among the various bad habits, the prohibition of opening a kiln is the biggest obstacle to improving the ceramic industry. Therefore, in order to develop the ceramic industry in Jiangxi Province, the Jiangxi authorities have specially established a Pottery Industry Administration in Jingdezhen to revitalize the dream of the pottery industry and commissioned Du Chongyuan, an expert in the porcelain industry, to preside over the improvement matters. In Du's plan, the first step is to abolish the "kiln prohibition," which has been the biggest obstacle to the ceramic industry for the past forty years.</p>
<p>The beginning of the kiln prohibition dates back to the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, kiln owners (i.e., those who opened kiln factories) sacrificed the interests of other businesses for their own benefit, and gathered their peers to jointly formulate this self-defeating suicide policy. From then on, kiln owners only managed the firing of the kiln, and did not care whether the porcelain was good or bad after firing. If there was under-firing (meaning not cooked), over-firing (meaning overcooked), or collapse, the kiln owners not only did not bear the responsibility for compensation, but also had to ask the kiln owners for firewood costs. Kiln owners were not allowed to express dissatisfaction. Otherwise, the next time they fired, they would deliberately damage the porcelain to blackmail them. Because kiln owners were unable to fire themselves, they still had to entrust them to fire for them. Otherwise, the kiln owners would unanimously refuse. The suffering of the kiln owners was great and extreme. In recent years, there have been many incidents of collapse. The main reason is that the kiln owners only care about the quantity of goods, so they have expanded the kiln body (twice as large as before), but they do not know that after the kiln body is enlarged, the sagger (a refractory container used to hold porcelain in the kiln) becomes heavier. At the same time, the firepower is increased. When the firepower is strong and the sagger is heavy, there is often a danger of the kiln collapsing.</p>
<p>This corrupt habit has been around for a long time and is not easy to eradicate. When Du Chongyuan took office, in order to be cautious, he convened various businesses and explained them in detail, resolutely abolishing the prohibition and issuing a notice. The notice said, "Jingdezhen's porcelain industry has a long history and is famous at home and abroad. However, because the work is conservative, unchangeable, and divided into factions, the glorious history and vast sales market of thousands of years have been taken away by foreign porcelain, which is extremely painful. The director of this bureau has insight into the accumulated abuses and is determined to eliminate bad habits and improve the Chinese porcelain industry. Since arriving in Zhen, I have carefully studied and realized that the biggest of the bad rules is the prohibition of opening a kiln. Once a kiln is prohibited, the number of damaged products in the damaged area increases, making it impossible to work. Porcelain merchants lack goods to purchase and can only sit and wait, which hinders production internally and loses reputation externally. In addition, the volume of the kiln body has been enlarged, and there are many cases of collapse. The number of firings has been reduced, and the cost must be huge. Over time, the kiln owners will be in deficit and the porcelain merchants will be insufficient, and they will inevitably perish together. The management of pottery affairs by this bureau is primarily to promote benefits and eliminate abuses. From now on, the kiln prohibition will be permanently abolished. No one is allowed to comply in appearance but disobey in reality, or to continue the accumulated habits of the past, lest they offend. Comply immediately, this is the notice." In the future, the bureau also plans to organize the Jiangxi Pottery Industry Improvement Committee and the Pottery Workers Affairs Improvement Committee, whose main members are all local people who are enthusiastic about improving the pottery industry and workers with experience, and they will be combined. The opportunity for improvement is not far away, and we should wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiangxi Province Expands Agricultural Loans — Provincial Government is Currently Deploying Implementation — <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi suffered from eight years of banditry and the unprecedented drought last year. The countryside is fragmented and desolate. Not only have people gone bankrupt, but the banditry was most tragic in southern Jiangxi and the secluded areas bordering neighboring provinces. Houses were destroyed and the number of adult men decreased. The drought was most tragic in the counties of northern Jiangxi. People were displaced, and deaths were frequent. The disaster areas are of course unable to resume spring plowing. Even in the hinterland near the provincial capital and eastern Jiangxi, which were formerly known as rich areas, farmers have no food grains or seeds and cannot maintain their livelihoods. In order to save the countryside, the provincial government recently convened the directors of the agricultural college, Dong Shijin, and others to discuss relief measures. They all agreed that the most urgent needs of farmers at the moment are food and seeds. Therefore, it was decided to expand agricultural loans and plan to raise 1.2 million yuan as capital for farmers' loans in various places. After consulting with the agricultural loan group, Zou Bingwen, and the banking sector to provide loan capital, the Rural Cooperative Committee will distribute loans by region to provide relief, and Wen Qun, chairman of the Provincial Rural Cooperative Association, has been requested to return to Jiangxi from Hankou to plan the implementation.

<h3 id="e94">After the Closing of the Mouth: A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Guantai: Rising Water and Wind Blow the Main Current Back to the River; Height of the Jinmenkou is Level with the Two Dams <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Guantai closing project is of great importance to the lives and property of the people of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces. On the 11th, Bianyuan suddenly received a report from Kong Xiangrong that it had been closed. All parties felt surprised. On the 12th, the reporter went to the Work Relief Group to inquire. Because its important staff were all at the construction site, the details were not clear. In order to understand the situation, I personally went to inspect at 11:00 a.m. today. Those who accompanied me were Zheng Kanghou, the magistrate of Kaifeng County. The car left Caomen, crossed the moat embankment, and drove along the Kai-Cao Road. Passing through the fifth district of Kaifeng, the wheat fields were green and endless. Compared with the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts, where the land was covered with yellow sand and people had nothing to live on except planting willows and peanuts, the difference was like heaven and earth. After Zhaotaoying, about forty li from Zhizhi, we entered the jurisdiction of Chenliu County. After another twenty li to Quxingji, we turned north for a li or so, passed Guantai, and drove more than ten li into the beach to reach the Chenliu ferry. On the south bank, stones were transported from the Lanfeng Station, and thousands of large and small carts carrying willow branches and straw from Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Minquan, Chenliu, and other counties came and went endlessly. The unloaded piles of willow straw were like mountains. Many boats transported materials from the river to the north bank. The materials on the north bank were even more numerous. The iron anchor alone was amazing. Walking east along the bank for dozens of steps, there was a water-permeable willow dam, and the degree of siltation had reached nine points. In front of it was another dam, which was similar in shape. These two dams were both built on the mouth last month on the 27th and 28th. Because of their effect, the main current moved south. Climbing the earthen embankment to the north, the supervisors, soldiers, and Maofu, and the disaster victims' teams from Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Dongming, Changyuan, Fengqiu Puyang, Hua County, etc., totaled about more than two thousand people. Those who pushed the soil and those who carried the materials came and went like a shuttle. Some were raising and thickening the earthen embankment, preparing to protect the eaves with willow branches at the appropriate time. It was heard from the supervisors that they would build it three meters high and one zhang and five wide. When the entire embankment is completed, it will take more than a day. Going east to Longmenkou, Kong Xiangrong and Secretary Xu Shihao, Inspector Zhu Changan, Yao Zeton, and Huanglihui engineer Zheng Yaoxi were all engaged in supervision. Ma River's current trended east, opening its mouth due east. Originally, there was no water. After the 20th, the peach blossom water rose, and the northwest wind blew strongly, gradually washing away, eventually causing the main current to flow east and return to the main river. This was the main reason for the rapid closing of the mouth. The current height of Jinmenkou has been built to the same level as the east and west dams, forming a unified whole. Because it is blocked with willow and stone bags, a closing willow broom is being added on the side facing the river to completely seal off the air. According to measurements, the water surface of the mouth facing the river is five feet higher than the water surface behind the river. The Huayang embankment on the back river originally had a river surface one kilometer wide and about four meters deep. Now the water surface is only about thirty meters wide, and the water depth is less than one meter, and the siltation is very fast. The disaster areas of Changyuan and Kaifeng have both reported a five-foot drop in water level and will soon be dry. According to Kong Xiangrong, since the Work Relief Group took over the closing of the mouth on the 21st of last month, they have tried their best to concentrate materials and manpower and proceed accordingly. First, they rushed to build the eave protection project on the east and west dams previously built in a short period of time, that is, willow bundles and stone piles were placed along the river on both dams, and the two ends were sunk with ropes to make them come out of the water, and then stones were thrown, or the rear section was staked and stoned to make them quite solid and without worries. At the bottom of the kernel willow stone pillow, the rope was tied to the boat in front of the dam, and the boat was fixed with an iron anchor. Willow stone pillows were made on the boat, the stones were wrapped in willow lead wire, and the waist was tied with hemp rope to make the length the same as the mouth and strong. Then they were slowly sent down from the two boats to sink to the bottom. Then another layer was lowered to make it silt up. Day and night, a total of 419 pillows were dropped in the mouth of the two main dams before the closure was successful, 374 facing the river, 84 behind the river, and 246 on the edge of the back river. 350 pillows were dropped in the mouth of the East Dam, 949 facing the river, and 226 on the edge of the back river, for a total of 2,648 pillows, which was very effective. When it reached a considerable level, more than ten feet from the water surface, personnel, soldiers, laborers, materials, and materials were gathered before dawn on the 11th to start rushing to block, and it was successful. As of the 11th of this month, about 3.5 million jin of willow branches, about 1,800 market squares of stone, about 1.3 million jin of straw, about 88,000 sacks, about 191,000 jin of hemp, and about 810 bundles of lead wire were used, which was much more than the budget. The remaining materials will be handed over to the future protective agencies, etc. About half a li northwest of the mouth, a play was being performed. Then I went to the office of the Work Relief Group to rest for a while. At seven o'clock, I braved the rain to cross the river and return. It was already ten o'clock when I returned to the juice.

<h3 id="e96">Eastern Zhejiang: Lifting of the Blockade of Quzhou Territory - No Trace of Bandits on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Quzhou Dispatch: The counties of Jiangshan, Changshan, and Kaihua in Quzhou territory, Eastern Zhejiang, are adjacent to Wuyuan, Yushan, and Dexing in Jiangxi province. Previously, due to the occupation of the bandit rebels in the Eastern Jiangxi area, in order to cut off their material supplies, these counties strictly blockaded and uniformly prohibited the transportation of goods into Jiangxi. Even the few law-abiding citizens were only allowed to purchase necessary items like salt and kerosene based on their good citizen certificates, and even then, restrictions were imposed to prevent them from flowing into the bandit areas. After the implementation of this policy, the annual business of trade goods transported from Jiangshan, Changshan, and Kaihua to Eastern Jiangxi decreased from over 1.2 million yuan to over 100,000 yuan, causing a huge impact on the local economy and losses to merchants. It is now known that Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government, considering that the bandit disturbances in Jiangxi have been suppressed, recently sent Lu Zhongxiu, the Chief of the Third Branch of the Security Preservation Division, to participate in the post-bandit conference held by the Border Area Pacification Headquarters of the four provinces, to discuss this matter. It was decided that since the local bandit disturbances have been quelled, the blockade of the bandit areas will be lifted starting this month, so that goods from Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, and other counties can be freely transported and sold into Jiangxi, in order to benefit the merchants and help revive the local economy. The border defenses at present are quite solid, and no trace of bandits has been discovered. However, in the eastern countryside of Wuyuan, bordering Kaihua and Kunlian, scattered bandits have been entering from Fuliang and Anhui in the past two weeks, hoping to regroup in Jiangxi. The Zhejiang garrison is strictly preventing and suppressing them, so that the ashes of the bandit rebellion will not rekindle.</p>

<p>The county government, considering that the route of the Song-Si Road county road has long been surveyed and should be expanded as soon as possible to facilitate transportation, issued a public announcement for bidding. The Construction Department dispatched Yi Shouchu to Songjiang today (the 19th) to open the bids in public at the county government. County Magistrate Jin Tigan and Technical Section Chief Xu Mojia attended to supervise. The bids were opened, and the prices were as follows: Zhu Bingji's bid was 7,691.8 yuan for earthwork, 20,189.05 yuan for road surface materials and labor, and 1,120 yuan for water pipes, totaling 29,000.85 yuan. Tang Jiangji's bid was 7,384.8 yuan for earthwork, 18,610.2 yuan for road surface materials and labor, and 1,000 yuan for water pipes, totaling 26,994.1 yuan. Heji Company's bid totaled 31,142.6 yuan. Since Tang Jiangji's estimate was the cheapest, they should be awarded the bid. However, considering the time and economic factors, it was feared that Tang Jiangji alone would have difficulty undertaking the project. After consultation, it was agreed to cooperate with Zhu Bingji according to their respective bid prices, with Zhu Bingji also undertaking a portion of the project. After the negotiations were settled, it was decided that the successful bidder would come to the county government immediately to sign the contract, in order to start construction.</p>

<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 18th, a traveler wearing a brocade crepe cotton robe checked into the Railway Hotel on Chezhan Road. He claimed to be named Shen Jikang, 25 years old, from Zhejiang. He immediately booked room number seven to rest. He went out at around 6:00 PM and returned to the hotel at 10:00 PM, closed the door, and went to sleep.

<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery tickets in this county are sold by four businesses: Da Li Yuan, Tian Fu Lai, and Da Ji Xiang. On the 15th of this month, the draw for the eleventh period was held in Tianjin, and the winning numbers were announced early. Unexpectedly, the four selling businesses published an announcement on the 16th, stating that counterfeit tickets had been discovered and, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between real and fake tickets, they would redeem the original tickets for their original price. It happened that a local man from Hupu Township, surnamed Kong, had purchased a ticket from the local Tian Fu Lai shop, and his number was 115923, which had won the third prize, entitling him to a prize of 4,000 yuan. Now seeing the advertisement to redeem the tickets, Kong was unwilling to be left empty-handed. Because the ticket he purchased had the Tian Fu Lai shop's stamp on the back, he believed it was not counterfeit. Therefore, he deeply suspects the selling shops and is now preparing to negotiate, or even resort to legal action, to seek a thorough resolution.</p>

<p>In the river of Hupu, our county, there are often ships sailing to and from various ports, carrying cargo. In the first ten days of this month, there was a ship named Gongda that was commissioned to carry bean cakes to Haizhou. However, ships leaving the port are usually loaded with local products for sale before loading goods for the return trip. The Gongda ship, because the owner was poor, was already mortgaged to a bank in the city for 20,000 yuan and lacked the funds to load goods, so it left the port empty. There were five other ships traveling with it, but they were all heavily loaded. Unexpectedly, when the ships were near the Menshan area near Haizhou, they suddenly encountered a hurricane. Because the Gongda was an empty ship, it could not withstand the storm and immediately capsized. The shipowner Jiang Dashi (from Hengjing, Taicang) and nineteen of his companions were all drowned without any survivors. An elder named Zhu has already arrived at the port to report the incident. The total loss of the entire ship is estimated to be around 40,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The street light donation in the provincial capital has always been collected by the Public Security Bureau on a household basis and handed over to the Electric Light Company. When Zhong Zhiying was the director of the Construction Bureau, he and the Public Security Bureau jointly formulated a rectification plan, intending to change it to a 5% surcharge on the monthly electricity bill for citizens. However, it could not be implemented due to obstacles. Last year, the county government was ordered to rectify the street lights in the provincial capital, and it was planned to implement the previously established plan. The only question was whether users would be willing to pay this donation. Therefore, the Electric Light Company, the Public Security Bureau, and the Construction Bureau were called together for discussion. It was decided that the company should first issue a notice to solicit users' opinions before making a decision. However, the Electric Light Company was eager to implement it and did not hesitate to submit a report to the Construction Department, stating that after the meeting, it was decided that the company would submit a request to the Construction Department to forward it to the Construction Committee, so that the revised collection plan and regulations could be approved and then announced for implementation. The Construction Department then ordered the Zhenjiang County government to reply. The county government recorded the agreed-upon method and submitted it to the Construction Department. After receiving the report, the Construction Department issued an order to the county government yesterday, stating that the submitted documents had been noted. The company had changed the agreed-upon method of the meeting on its own and submitted a report to the department, which was extremely absurd and has been reprimanded. It has also been instructed to proceed according to the county's meeting decision, which should be noted.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Nanjing: Porcelain Merchants Petition for the Abolition of Miscellaneous Taxes <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The porcelain merchants of various ports, opposing Jingdezhen's illegal establishment of a porcelain liquidation donation, have repeatedly consulted and petitioned for its abolition, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that porcelain merchants from Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Nantong, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other ports have jointly petitioned the relevant authorities to abolish it and have sent representatives Wang Shoushan, Yuan Shouchun, Hu Gan, Cheng Zhang Diqian, Yan Qing, and Hu Aigu to the Chairman's Headquarters and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to request relief. The memorandum to Chairman Chiang from the representatives states that the recent revival of the porcelain donation in Jingdezhen contradicts the central government's decree to abolish likin and other donations, the decision of the Second National Financial Conference to abolish miscellaneous taxes within a limited time, and the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department's approval in document No. 2243 of the 21st year of the Republic, granting porcelain taxes the same treatment as other taxes. The merchants dare to petition for abolition because their leader is advocating the National Economic Construction Movement, the initial step of which is to eliminate exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and alleviate the suffering of the people. This proves that the porcelain liquidation donation should not be allowed to exist under any circumstances. Moreover, the quota for the donation is 169,000 yuan, and the amount collected has already reached over 100,000 yuan. The remaining 39,000 yuan is a drop in the bucket and cannot compensate for the larger plan. It only harms the law and discipline. If it is allowed to continue indefinitely without being abolished, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Therefore, they urgently petition for an order to abolish it, and so on.</p>

<p>The recent continuous spring rains have caused the Qiantang River to rise sharply. Yesterday, the water level reached eight meters. The beach at the Qin Yin Tang area on the north bank has been eroded by water for over two hundred feet, and the situation is quite dangerous. The Construction Department has ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to work with the municipal government to devise a method to urgently repair the water diversion dam that has been damaged by the river, in order to control the water flow. It is estimated that over 63,000 yuan will be needed, with each of the two organizations contributing half. Construction will begin on a set date. In addition, hundreds of thousands of mu of newly formed sand land have recently risen above the Qibao area on the Hangzhou-Hai'ning embankment. This can be used to protect the embankment and construct a water dam. The Qiantang River tide has changed direction due to the rise of sand and is now surging fiercely towards Nansha, Xiaoshan. In the future, those who want to watch the tide at Hai'ning will have to change their location.</p>

It is learned that the three banks are currently discussing detailed measures for implementation. It is also reported that the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the mortgage loan of 15 million yuan will be managed by the three banks, as the increase in capital of the three banks this time is for loan relief to industry and commerce and to stabilize the social economy. As for the remaining credit guarantee loan of 5 million yuan, it will be handled by the three banks in conjunction with the Bankers' Association. In response to the requests of the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, the Bankers' Association had previously established a sub-committee to discuss measures, and 1.885 million yuan had already been recognized by the member banks. Therefore, the Bankers' Association decided to join in the handling after the three banks have agreed on the measures.

In the future, a committee will be organized to preside over the matter.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday (the 19th) was the 12th day of the Shanghai preview of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. People from all walks of life have been visiting in recent days. Because the exhibits have unparalleled artistic value and are systematically arranged, they are very convenient for research, so they have been well received. The number of visitors yesterday was even greater, and many were from the art world. They were very interested in each exhibit and lingered for a long time before leaving, which shows the depth of art's appeal to people. The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Art Circles Discuss Photographing Mr. Shiwei</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fine Arts Life Magazine Society sent a letter to the association yesterday, saying: "We aim to develop Chinese art and make it universal. We pay special attention to ancient Chinese art. Because your association will use ancient Chinese art to win glory for the country overseas, we are willing to do our best to promote it and plan to publish a special issue. We have specially sent Mr. Luo Guxun to contact you and hope that you will grant us permission to take photographs." This is addressed to the Chinese Art International Exhibition Association and signed by the Shanghai Fine Arts Life Magazine Society.</p>
<p>General Outline of Explanations of Calligraphy and Painting</p>
<p>The exhibits of this exhibition are divided into four parts: (1) Bronzes, (2) Porcelain, (3) Calligraphy and Painting, (4) Miscellaneous Items. Explanations of bronzes and porcelain have been stated in the catalog of exhibits for the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London sold by the association. The explanations of calligraphy and painting have also been written by the association. The first chapter of the explanation is recorded below for the reference of those who appreciate calligraphy and painting. The first chapter of the explanation says: "The study of Chinese calligraphy and painting has a very long history. Its characteristic lies in the mutual connection between the study of calligraphy and the study of painting, so it occupies an important position in world art. Only China has the study of painting and no study of calligraphy. Although Japan has the study of calligraphy, it takes the study of Chinese calligraphy as its study of calligraphy. Chinese calligraphy and painting are both based on the premise of expressing inner thoughts. There is a close connection between them, and there is no limit to each other. All the nobility of personality and the profoundness of knowledge are based on the spiritual expression, inner accumulation and external manifestation, which is different from simply depicting the entity of objects. The techniques are also sufficient to support it. The surviving relics of ancient objects (referring to silk and paper) such as Zhong Yao, Wang Xizhi, and Gu Kaizhi of the Six Dynasties are relatively old and difficult to determine their authenticity. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, there are still many remaining, which are sufficient for research. Now, we will explore the sources and schools of calligraphy and painting of past dynasties and list them to introduce them to scholars at home and abroad who are interested in Chinese calligraphy and painting as follows." (The following is the evolution of the study of calligraphy in the second chapter and its famous artists will be continued tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Various Schools Request Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>The exhibits of this exhibition are rich in educational and artistic value. In recent days, various schools have sent letters requesting preferential visits, including Shanghai Law College, Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Women's Middle School, Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Guanghua University, and Daxia University. Regarding Shanghai Law College, Guanghua University, Daxia University, and other schools, the association has replied to contact the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education directly regarding the preferential measures and the arrangement of visit dates. Regarding Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Women's Middle School and Shanghai Middle School, the association has directly replied to approve them.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the equipment for the International Telecommunications Bureau's wireless radio station for opening international wireless telephone lines was shipped, it is being rushed to be installed, with the goal of completing the installation by the end of this month and connecting to various countries within the year. Domestic wireless telephones in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan can also be opened for calls simultaneously. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>All Reporting Machines Have Arrived, Installation to Be Completed by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The international wireless telephone reporting machines have been shipped to Shanghai one after another since the end of last year, and now they have all arrived and are being rushed to be installed. It is estimated that the installation can be completed by the end of this month. The countries to be connected include England, Germany, Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Japan, Saigon, Geneva, and other places. It is estimated that the calls can be fully opened within the year. If the reporting service is busy in the future, more equipment may be added. It is still possible to cope with the different times in Europe and the United States. The difficulty is in the Philippines and Japan, because the time is the same, and it is feared that the existing equipment will not be sufficient when the reporting service is busy.</p>
<p>Actively Contacting Various Countries to Connect for Calls</p>
<p>The contact with various countries for calls, the European countries and Japan, is handled by the Ministry of Communications. The United States and the Philippines are handled by the International Telecommunications Bureau. The timing of formal calls must be determined according to the outcome of the negotiations. The call price is determined by the Ministry of Communications. International calls are based on international standard prices, while the calculation of domestic and international transfer call costs is more complicated, so it is still being drafted.</p>
<p>Domestic Calls Will Be Fully Open by the End of the Year</p>
<p>As for domestic wireless telephone calls, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan are all installing equipment, and it is estimated that it will also be completed by the end of this month or early next month. Formal calls must also be fully opened within this year. The northern areas can use wired telephones, so there is no need to install wireless telephones separately. When domestic and international telephones are fully opened at that time, China's telephone business will become more developed.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Zhejiang Province Cleans Up Drugs, Zhejiang Provincial Association Requests Extension of Two Years <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The All Zhejiang Provincial Association wired the Zhejiang Provincial Government, saying: "To the esteemed Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The achievements of Zhejiang Province in banning opium are superior to those of other provinces. Since Chairman Lu presented to the Central Government for approval the Provisional Regulations for Cleaning Up Drugs in Zhejiang Province and selected and appointed special commissioners for opium suppression to go to various counties to conduct on-site investigations, the results have been increasingly remarkable. However, it is found that in Article 2 of the newly promulgated Measures for Opium Suppression, Zhejiang Province has been listed as an absolutely prohibited province for planting. Article 4 deals with cracking down on opium smokers, organizing opium smoker registration, and collectively referring to provinces and cities. Article 6 allows for the purchase of opium from border provinces, and Article 7 allows for the establishment of opium shops in various provinces and cities, all of which restore the opium suppression measures of the late Qing Dynasty. This method of restricting and collecting opium is a good method for provinces where opium addiction is rampant, but from the perspective of Zhejiang Province, where opium suppression has always been strict, having opium smoker licenses and opium shops in operation is tantamount to the revival of opium and the spread of opium disasters. Opium has spread for more than a century, and because Zhejiang is close to Shanghai, with convenient land and water transportation, private smuggling is easy, and secret private smoking has not been completely eliminated. However, according to the special article of the criminal law punishing people for opium smoking, those who commit the crime must be punished. Openly selling and smoking opium is absolutely impossible. Therefore, the measures for implementing opium suppression may be feasible in other provinces, but they are not feasible in our Zhejiang. Recently, rumors have spread in Shanghai that someone has recognized to run opium shops in Zhejiang Province for 2.5 million yuan. In the past, those who were executed for private sales were numerous. If opium is allowed to be sold openly now, what kind of government system will it be? This saying is probably a rumor. Furthermore, Article 1 of the Measures for Implementing Opium Suppression stipulates that in addition to handling according to other opium suppression regulations, the existing Regulations for Cleaning Up Drugs in Zhejiang Province should be in the excluded list and can still be strictly investigated and banned according to the province's separate regulations to eliminate the opium disaster. Please, Your Excellency, quickly wire the Central Government to approve the extension of the Provisional Regulations for Cleaning Up Drugs in Zhejiang Province for two years, so that it can continue to be strictly implemented to eliminate the opium disaster. The people of Zhejiang are very worried. The All Shanghai Zhejiang Provincial Association bows respectfully."</p>

It was unanimously agreed that you have led the work of this Association for eight years, enabling the Association's achievements in participating in the municipal administration of the Concession to progress with each passing year. We deeply admire your virtuous labor. At present, the foundation of this Association is not yet fully consolidated, and there is still much work to be done. All affairs depend on your continued leadership to achieve complete success. It is definitely not the time to retreat. As for the term of the Chairman, it has been decided by the General Assembly to be referred to the Election Regulations Drafting Committee for research. If the regulations stipulate a term limit, then the position will be replaced according to law, and there will be an opportunity for a short break. It was decided to unanimously retain you.

<h3 id="e150">Jisheng Association Continues Spring Relief in Yili Area <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association and other charities, such as the Huayang Yizhen Association, are handling spring relief in Yixing and Liyang. They are currently dispatching relief workers to conduct surveys by region. Relief in Yi includes investigating the four districts of 4, 5, 6, and 7. Relief in Li includes investigating the four districts of 1, 2, 3, and 6. Because the disaster areas in these two counties are very large and the resources of the charities are limited, they can only handle relief by region according to their capabilities. It has now been reported by the relief chief, Mr. Li Yunmen, that the relief in Yixing has completed the surveys of districts 6 and 7. There are more than 9,000 households in district 7 and 7,800 households in district 6. The number of households in other districts is also not small. The relief workers have personally witnessed that the disaster victims in the area either eat grass roots and tree bark, or eat Guanyin powder, appearing emaciated and barely alive. Some commit suicide by poisoning, drowning, or hanging. Others sell their children, resulting in separation or death. Others flee famine and never return, resulting in death and family destruction. Still others flee to other counties but are blocked from advancing and return to their hometowns, unable to survive and left to die. All kinds of tragic scenes are heartbreaking and bring tears to the eyes. If we calculate 5 or 6 family members per household, one district already has more than 9,000 households. The porridge is scarce, and there are too many monks, making it difficult to distribute. If one district is like this, other districts can be imagined. Even if the charity tries its best to solicit funds, its ability does not match its intentions. How much can it get? Moreover, because of rural bankruptcy and economic depression, fundraising has become difficult for charitable organizations. In this day and age, where can we find so much money to save the starving and rescue lives? We hope that charitable comrades within the country, while still alive, can offer ten spoons of soup to save a life, and share their clothes and food to create immeasurable blessings. This is the time to do so! By saving people today, they will surely receive good karma in the future. The disaster victims in the dried-up ruts are looking forward to it and waiting for orders.</p>

<p>The General Office of the Red Swastika Society's Relief for Jiangxi Disaster dispatched relief teams to Jiangxi last year to handle emergency relief and burial and medical treatment work in disaster areas such as Ningdu, Guangchang, Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Qianshan. The work is nearing completion. However, because the disaster area is vast and there is a spring famine, with refugees everywhere, it is still necessary to continue the relief efforts. It has now been decided to continue relief operations in counties such as Lichuan, Nanfeng, Nancheng, and Gaoan. In addition, 10,000 yuan has been allocated to Ruichang County, 5,000 yuan to Pengze County, 1,000 yuan to Wuning County, and 2,000 yuan to Wanzai County. It is reported that the 15,000 yuan for Ruichang and Pengze counties has already been used to purchase and distribute seeds.</p>

Three new-style Damengtian buses have been temporarily allocated to run back and forth, with a temporary office set up on Dongchang Road and personnel dispatched to manage it. As for the parking lot and office buildings, more than one mu of land has been rented, which will be completed soon. The original plan was to go from Dongchang Road to Qinci Yangdian.</p>
<p>The road surface of the Qinci Yangdian section has been newly paved, but due to the dangerous construction, the management office was notified to redefine the route, changing it to Dongchang Road, Zhangjiazhai, Yangjiazhai, Qichangzhan, Fujiazhai, Lingjiaqiao, and Yangjing Town as the terminal. The fare is six cents per stop. From Dongchang Road, the starting station, to Yangjing Town, the terminal station, the fare is thirty-six cents.</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Line 5 route has been defined, starting from Luban Road, Xinhang Road, Jumen Road, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Fangxie Road, Zhonghua Road, Railway Station Road, Guohuo Road, Limalu Road, Minguo Road, Fangbang Road, Zhaojiabang Road, Xieqiao, Liyuan Road, etc. There are a total of nineteen stops, including the call stops.

<h3 id="e154">Township Residents in Luodian Town Are Superstitious; Offering Heavenly Provisions Causes Tragedy; More Than Thirty People Injured and Killed <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Luodian Town in Baoshan County is the leading town at the border between the county and Jiading County. Its market is not inferior to Liuhe Town in Taicang County. There is a Jade Emperor Temple on North Street in the town, which is revered by the townspeople as the Heavenly Palace. Therefore, every year, the City God Temples in the surrounding villages must make offerings of heavenly provisions. In recent years, due to the impact of agricultural bankruptcy, the residents have become increasingly superstitious, believing that the heavenly provisions are insufficient and suspecting that the gods are causing trouble. Some people have long proposed making offerings of heavenly provisions. After Long County Chief heard about this, he issued a notice prohibiting it. Until yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, the City God Temples in the four villages around the town, numbering as many as thirty-six, along with other secret inspectors' land temples, all carried paper-pasted silver ingots, etc., to the Jade Emperor Palace to offer provisions. Thousands of villagers from the four villages came to watch the excitement, causing the road to become congested. While the audience was absorbed in the spectacle, the stone railings on both sides of the Xin Bridge (behind the bus station) in the town suddenly collapsed with a loud crash. The audience on the bridge, along with the stones, all fell into the river. At that time, an old woman, aged sixty, whose son's name was Zhou Xunhe, lived in Zhoujia Village, southwest of Luodian. Her skull cracked and she died instantly. About thirty others were slightly or seriously injured. The villagers carried them back on their own, and their life or death cannot be investigated (some were as far as twenty li away). The rest were sent to the injured. The injured were bandaged by Doctor Li and others, and sent out. The seriously injured were all. The following is what was learned from yesterday's investigation: Fang Shenshi, 40 years old; Chen Shi, 40 years old; Hong Chenshi, 64 years old; Zhou Tushi, 70 years old; Jin Yangshi, 65 years old; Zhu Aizhong, 27 years old; Wang Yaoshi, 25 years old, all female. There were also males Liu Huisheng, 48 years old, and Shen Ayu, 20 years old, etc. All are currently not out of danger.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Parricide by Strangulation Case: Exhumation for Autopsy Held Yesterday; Yu Guanhong Addicted to Drugs and Fallen; Rope Marks Found on Neck <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>No. 2 New House, Yujiatang, south of Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, is the address of Yu Huogen (62 years old), a local resident who makes a living by farming. He had a son named Guanhong (also known as Jilin), who is now 36 years old. He married a Chen and has one son and two daughters. Unfortunately, Guanhong does not engage in proper work, is greedy and lazy, and has addictions. Recently, he has been using morphine and smoking red pills. His father and wife have repeatedly advised him to quit, but to no avail. Therefore, his father hates him to the core. Starting this spring, Guanhong has been deprived of food. Guanhong has no choice but to go out to beg for food every day, looking like a beggar. Yu Huogen is extremely resentful of his unfilial son and has murderous intentions. Therefore, on the night of the 11th of this month, he colluded with his daughter-in-law, Chen (Guanhong's wife), and an accomplice, Zhang Ajin, and strangled Guanhong with a rope. The next day, they falsely claimed that he had died of illness and hastily put him in a coffin and buried him. However, rumors spread among the villagers, and they all said that Chen had murdered her husband. Now, the Hongqiao Town Police Station has learned of the situation. Because the case involves a human life, Yu Huogen and Yu Chen were summoned for interrogation the day before yesterday. After interrogation, Yu Huogen was released on bail, pending further instructions. At the same time, the police were ordered to escort Yu Chen to the local court. After questioning by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, she was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. It was ordered to exhume the body for autopsy to clarify the truth. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lei, along with Examiner Xuan Zhiming, took a car to the countryside and went directly to Yujiatang, south of Hongqiao Town. The mortuary had already prepared everything, and the coffin of Yu Guanhong was carried to the mortuary. The small coffin workers opened the coffin and performed the autopsy according to the law. It was confirmed that the deceased Yu Guanhong had obvious rope marks on his neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death before his death. The death certificate was filled out, and it was ordered to reseal the coffin. After the judge completed the autopsy, Yu Huogen, the deceased's father, was summoned to the case for a brief interrogation. He was ordered to be handed over to the local bailiff for proper custody, pending further investigation. According to general accounts, Yu Huogen, in his twilight years, took advantage of his son's sound sleep and tightly strangled Guanhong's neck with a rope. Guanhong woke up from his sleep and resisted, and Yu Huogen called his daughter-in-law, Chen, to help him commit the crime. The deceased was no match and was eventually strangled to death.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Giant Snake Discovered in Ye Tomb in Pudong; Raising Head Towards Foreman; Grave Diggers Intended to Steal and Sell <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Near the Milk Shed on Xujiaqiang, Yangjiadu, Pudong, a new road is being built. Beside it is a Ye family tomb field, covering an area of more than four mu. The grain deed holder is Ye Deru Tang. Many coffins are buried inside. The tomb field has been cultivated by gravekeeper Lu Heshang (over 70 years old). The Hua family descendants have not visited for more than ten years. Initially, the farmers rotated grain for cultivation. After it was developed into a road, the land prices on both sides rose sharply, and someone intercepted the grain deeds, stole the grain, and intended to steal and sell the land. Early in the morning the day before yesterday, a person resembling a foreman led more than twenty Jiangbei laborers, carrying tools, to excavate tombs in the tomb field. Twenty-six coffins were exhumed (more than ten of which had tombstones with the names, ages, and titles of the deceased, buried more than two hundred years ago). When one tomb was opened, poisonous snakes (red-banded snakes and gray snakes) were found. Many were several feet long to one or two zhang long, all of which were killed by the laborers with iron tools. Among them was a giant snake of more than five zhang long, with a head the size of a large bowl, blood-red all over, and eyes like blood. The foreman ordered the workers to beat and tie it according to law. The giant snake seemed to be spiritual, and upon hearing this, it raised its head towards the foreman, acting as if it were begging for mercy. The ignorant workers shouted that it was kowtowing and begging for mercy. The foreman then ordered the workers to stop beating and tying it, and let it go. The giant snake then swam to the edge of the field and turned its head back towards the foreman. At that time, many nearby villagers heard the news and went to watch. Later, they saw the giant snake swimming towards a certain family's tomb field nearby. The laborers removed the corpses from the exhumed coffins and placed them in bone boxes (shaped like soap boxes) for relocation elsewhere. When the tombs were being dug, the gravekeeper Lu Heshang and the foreman of the diggers had a dispute over the unearthed tombstones. Lu managed to seize six tombstones. He has now found the descendants of the tomb owner and is seriously negotiating with the grave diggers. It is reported that the tomb field has been exchanged by the grave diggers for a land business license from the Land Bureau, and the grain has been transferred in preparation for stealing and selling the land.</p>

<p>A candy vendor came to Yangxing Village, northwest of Wusong, a few days ago, selling yellow sugar blocks at a very low price. For only two or three copper coins, one could buy a foot-square piece of sugar, or exchange it for old copper and scrap iron. However, they would not exchange it for rags or old clothes. This sugar seemed to be made of dry flour mixed with saccharin and soda, so it fermented very strongly. Children in the area, because of its low price, competed to buy and eat it. Unexpectedly, those who consumed it suffered from poisoning, abdominal distension, and severe pain. Before they could be rescued, six children, including those with the surname Li, died from eating this sugar. After the incident, the vendor had already fled without a trace. Upon learning of the situation, the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched police to search for him everywhere. They have already captured several other candy vendors and are conducting a strict investigation. It is also reported that similar incidents have occurred in the villages near the Wusong Fort in Taiwan. Therefore, recently, schools and parents in the Wusong area have warned all students and children not to buy candy from vendors again to avoid endangering their lives. It is said that the toxic effects of this poisonous candy are not immediately apparent after consumption, and illness only occurs after several days. Taking lily root and reed rhizome, etc., can supposedly detoxify, but it is not known for sure. It is deeply hoped that the health authorities will take appropriate measures to handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>Tang Fusheng, a native of Tongzhou, resides at No. 4, Lane 120, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. He works as a foreman in the cold working section of the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui. At 11 o'clock the night before last, Tang was sound asleep when he suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door and his name being called repeatedly. Tang woke up with a start, got up, pulled the bolt, and opened the door. Suddenly, two men with painted faces and wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers pointed handguns at Tang's face and fired. The bullet entered through Tang's nose and became deeply embedded. Tang was injured, collapsed to the ground, and lost consciousness. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the assailants fled without a trace. Tang's wife immediately reported the incident to the Pudong Sub-bureau. Captain Wang of the bureau's detective team led officers to arrest the assailants. Two bullets were found at the entrance of the house, but the assailants were nowhere to be found. The injured Tang was carried by his family to Pudong Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was transferred to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Director Zhang of the sub-bureau yesterday instructed detectives to rigorously pursue and apprehend the criminals to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Zhou Fashan, a native of Liuhe County, and Xu Zhenggui, a native of Nanjing, both earned their living by selling straw in the Hongkou area. Zhou's sister-in-law, Lin, ran a stove shop at No. 1 Miller Road, so Zhou lodged at his sister-in-law's house, while Xu rented a garret at No. 142 Jiaxing Road. They became friends in their poverty. On the morning of the 28th of last month, Zhou and Xu went together to the Pinfang Teahouse next to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to drink tea and chat. Suddenly, Wang Agui, a follower of the local ruffian Xu Songbao, and his mistress, Ama, led more than a dozen people and swarmed upstairs. Wang immediately accused Zhou of introducing Ama to someone for adultery and receiving a reward of thirty yuan, ordering him to hand over the money. Both Zhou and Xu firmly denied it. Wang then, seeing that both men were paupers, reduced the amount to fifteen yuan. However, Zhou and Xu still claimed ignorance and, feeling intimidated by the crowd, went downstairs to avoid them. Just as they stepped out of the teahouse, they were intercepted by Jin Awu, an informant, and Zhang Desheng, a detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and taken into the police station. After questioning by the head detective, Xu was released, while Zhou Fashan suddenly suffered an acute illness and died before he could receive medical treatment. The head detective ordered the body to be sent to the coroner's office. On the 30th, a report was made to the First Special District Local Court, and a prosecutor was appointed to lead a forensic doctor to the office.</p>
<p>Upon examination, the forensic doctor determined that the deceased had no injuries on his body and that he had died from a sudden heart attack due to stress. However, at that time, the deceased's wife, Zhou Zhao, was still in her hometown of Liuhe. Zhou Lin, the sister-in-law of the deceased, went to the station and refused to acknowledge that her uncle had died of illness, refusing to sign and claim the body. The prosecutor then ordered Pushan Villa to provide a coffin and temporarily bury the body. Later, the deceased's wife, Zhou Zhao, received a telegram and came to Shanghai, hiring a lawyer along with Xu Zhenggui to file a</p>
<p>criminal lawsuit against Jin Awu, Zhang Desheng, Wang Agui, and Ama and others in the First Special District Local Court, accusing Wang and his mistress Ama of using pretexts to extort money, and Jin and Zhang of using torture to extract confessions, resulting in injury and death, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan held a court hearing, but all four defendants failed to appear. Only the two plaintiffs, Zhou Zhao and Xu Zhenggui, and the witness Zhou Lin, came forward. The court first questioned Xu Zhenggui, who testified that at around 11 o'clock that morning, he and Zhou Fashan were drinking tea at Pinfang Teahouse when Wang Agui and Ama led more than a dozen people upstairs and attempted to extort money under false pretenses. They ignored them and immediately went downstairs, but were detained by Jin Awu and Zhang Desheng and taken to the police station. A foreigner first questioned Zhou</p>
<p>briefly. Because Zhou denied soliciting prostitution on behalf of others, Jin took Zhou away, and he never saw Zhou again. Later, he was also taken by Jin to another room for questioning and was slapped on both cheeks with a shoe sole. He is now also accusing Jin and Zhang of using torture to extract confessions, and accusing Wang et al. of attempted extortion. As for how Zhou died and whether he bled at the police station, he could not know because he did not see him. However, he heard Jin Awu say that Zhou was ill, and then said that Zhou had died of illness, but he knew that Zhou</p>
<p>had no signs of illness, etc. Then Zhou Zhao testified that she came to Shanghai after receiving a telegram from her hometown and was informed of everything by Xu Zhenggui before filing the lawsuit, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer then asked the court to examine the evidence of Zhou Zhao's accusation of torture to extract confessions in order to facilitate the investigation. He then requested on behalf of the woman to re-open the coffin and examine the body, saying that the evidence regarding torture to extract confessions was particularly difficult to collect. In order to accurately clarify the cause of death, it would be best to ask the Zhenru Forensic Institute to re-examine the body.

<p>Xiang Huian, a member of the China Black and White Photography Society, has a deep understanding of photography. Since becoming the chief photographer of the International News Photography Agency, he has been particularly interested in news photography. He felt that the old methods of magnesium flash photography were inconvenient and that it was impossible to photograph indoor and outdoor night sports photos, which he considered a pity. He resolved to research and overcome all the difficulties of high-speed photography in dark places. Recently, he assembled a high-speed magnesium flash camera that can take photographs of moving objects in indoor and outdoor dark places at speeds of 1/10th to 1/1000th of a second. It is easy to carry and simple to use. He has conducted several tests, all of which have been satisfactory. He is currently continuing to research and develop a high-speed magnesium flash lamp vapor camera, which will be completed soon.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Spring Fishing Season Production and Sales Decline – Authorities Pay Attention to Fishermen's Suffering – Vigorously Promote Cooperative Enterprises <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, many fishermen live along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces in China, and fish production is very high. However, due to the dumping of foreign goods and rampant piracy, and the fact that fishermen's fishing techniques are mostly outdated, the fishing industry has not been revitalized. This year, it has been further affected by the recession, which has had a major impact on the fishing industry. The authorities are now trying to rescue the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Falling Fish Prices: Since the spring fishing season this year, due to unfavorable weather and cold temperatures, although fishermen have tried their best to fish, their catches have been much lower than last year. Moreover, due to the impact of the recession, people's purchasing power is very weak, so sales are sluggish and prices have to fall. Last year, yellow croaker reached 9 yuan per dan, but this year it is only about 3 yuan. Fishermen originally regarded the spring fishing season as a period of mass production, but this year the catch is small and the price is low, which will have a major impact on the livelihoods of fishermen.</p>
<p>Authorities Pay Attention: The authorities are now paying close attention to the suffering of fishermen. Regarding the prevention of bandits, strict measures have been taken in recent years, so there has been no trace of bandits this year. Regarding production and sales, they are vigorously promoting cooperative enterprises and guiding the improvement of fishing methods. It is not appropriate for the current fishermen to stick to outdated methods. In the future, they will gradually plan to use fishing vessels for large-scale fishing. Regarding the required funding, the authorities are trying their best to find ways.</p>
<p>Building Fishing Ports: The authorities are also paying close attention to the construction of fishing ports. They have sent personnel to inspect the ports in various fishing areas in order to start building fishing ports in the future. However, the construction of fishing ports requires a lot of money, which is difficult to realize at a time when the national treasury is stretched. Moreover, the construction of fishing ports is not necessary at present. China still lacks large-scale fishing methods. In the future, fishing methods can be improved, and the production of fish can be increased by using large fishing vessels. Then fishing ports must be built. Therefore, it is only in the planning stage at present.</p>

<p>At about 8 p.m. last night, a bather wearing a gray silk robe and a Tibetan tweed collar, about 40 years old, looking like a member of the academic community, and speaking with a Zhenjiang accent, came to the Shuangfeng Pavilion Bathhouse on Shiqikou, Sima Road in the British Concession. He took off his robe in the warm room, sat on the couch, and read the newspaper. Suddenly, he fell down and lost consciousness. The tea attendant called him but received no response, and he was barely breathing. He immediately reported it to the cashier, who telegraphed the fire brigade, who sent an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He also reported it to the Dama Road Police Station, who sent detective Xie Guisheng to investigate the bathhouse. The bathhouse handed over the long robe and two letters left by the guest to the detective. Both letters were addressed to Pan Bingxia of Xidouwai, Zhenjiang.

<h3 id="e174">Zhang Shouyong Discusses Real Estate Investment Issues – Says New Village Real Estate Investment Methods are Sound – Shanghai People Should Shift Their Focus to the Suburbs <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Recently, newspapers have published suggestions from the China New Village Construction Society on reforming the real estate investment system, advocating a new village real estate cooperative investment method to break the market deadlock. The reporter then visited Mr. Zhang Shouyong, a member of the Fund Management Committee of the China Economic Credit Cooperative, which manages the investment funds of the society, to ask for his opinion. According to him, he knows the new method in great detail. The society's new village real estate cooperative investment is partly to expand the scope of the Qiangwei Garden New Village and partly to open up a new path for real estate investors. The method was devised by specialized talent who devoted themselves to research and sought advice from economists, so it is</p>
<p>quite sound. For example, (1) investors are not limited by financial resources, (2) the drawbacks of vacant rentals are avoided, (3) the interest rate on real estate investment is increased, (4) management, repair, and depreciation expenses are reduced, (5) all real estate is individually guaranteed and the original value is reduced by 10%, and (6) there is no difficulty in selling ordinary real estate, etc. These are all its advantages. In the current state of economic downturn, this is the only stable path for real estate investors. At present, there are many shortcomings in the real estate industry. If the new village real estate cooperative investment method is used as a blueprint to thoroughly reform the real estate investment system, then the future of the real estate industry may be promising. In my opinion, the greatest significance of new village real estate cooperative investment lies in encouraging</p>
<p>rural investment and promoting rural construction. In recent years, the bankruptcy of rural areas in the interior has also affected the crisis in Shanghai's future. Now, people have realized the current crisis, and everyone has attempted to go to the interior. For example, the number of banks going to the interior to establish branches has gradually increased. However, general real estate investors still regard this path as a dangerous one because interior investment lacks protection. Investors should be concerned about the issue of whether lending to the interior is appropriate. However, I believe that the beginning of all undertakings must have a great spirit. On the other hand, we must plan a good way to deal with the environment. Now, the society is opening up a stable path for those who want to invest in rural areas, and everyone does not have to doubt whether lending to the interior is appropriate. I hope that Shanghai people will shift their focus to the interior, open up their own prosperous gardens, and promote Shanghai's development.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Health Bureau to Start Vaccinations on May 1 – Compulsory Vaccinations for Slum Dwellers – Schools and Factories to Proceed in Order <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau is concerned about the spread of epidemics and the detriment to hygiene as summer approaches, so its epidemic prevention work brooks no delay. According to Yu Jihua, director of the Hunnan Health Clinic, the bureau has decided to start vaccinations in various places from May 1. The issue of funding has been submitted to the municipal government for allocation, and they are now actively preparing medicines, materials, and equipment for application. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Additional Personnel: Vaccinations in Groups</p>
<p>The Health Bureau will routinely add more than a dozen temporary personnel in the summer to specialize in epidemic prevention work, from May 1 to September 15, which can be completed in about four and a half months. Three groups of six people will be set up to carry the medicines to start work first. Eight more vaccination groups will be added in June to prevent infection.</p>
<p>Compulsory Vaccination for Slum Dwellers</p>
<p>According to the situation in previous years, epidemics mostly occur in slums, the reason being unhygienic diet and living. Therefore, cholera, typhoid, and bacillary dysentery are the most common diseases in summer and are extremely contagious. Therefore, it has been decided this year that it is necessary to force vaccinations on every household in the slums.</p>
<p>Schools and Factories: Vaccinations in Order</p>
<p>Prior notice will be sent to all public and private primary and secondary schools in the city to arrange dates and times. Personnel will be sent to the schools during the summer vacation to provide vaccinations in order to prevent the spread of epidemics. As for the male and female workers in the various factories in the city, they will also be notified in advance in accordance with the above-mentioned method and dates will be set before personnel are sent to administer vaccinations.</p>
<p>Budgeted Expenses: Approximately 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The bureau's vaccinations, regardless of age, require at least two injections per person, preferably three. The budget for staff salaries, transportation, meals, and equipment, medicines, materials, and other expenses, calculated at 80,000 injections, requires approximately 30,000 yuan. Director Li has submitted a request to the municipal government for allocation.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Pregnant Woman Dies Tragically After Abortion; Lover and Midwife Sentenced <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>A woman surnamed Wang, known as Wang Bao, from the northern countryside of Yangzhou, was 28 years old this year. She had a husband and three children at home, earning a living by farming. Due to famine in her hometown, she came to Shanghai alone to work as a domestic helper to earn wages and supplement the family income. She worked for a family surnamed Mou in Yuqing Lane, Wenzhou Road. Last November, while fetching water, she met Li Xiujian, a fellow villager who worked as a back scrubber at the Hot Springs Bathhouse on Rue Doumer. This year, he is 24 years old. The two immediately took a liking to each other and engaged in a clandestine affair. After several encounters, she became pregnant. Fearing she would lose face in front of her husband if she gave birth, she discussed the matter with her lover. They decided to have an abortion. On the 28th of last month, she was accompanied by Fu Pei to the home of Li Wang, an elderly midwife from Nanjing (68 years old this year), located at No. 6, Rue Pottier in the French Concession, to request an abortion. They agreed on a price of fifteen yuan, which was paid. Wang then stayed at the midwife's home. The next day, the midwife gave her a root of medicinal herb and a dose of labor-inducing drugs. On the afternoon of the 30th, the fetus was aborted. On the 1st of this month, Li Xiujian went to pick her up. However, due to internal injuries, she suffered unbearable abdominal pain. On the morning of the 3rd, Li took her to Huilü Hospital on Avenue Haig. He falsely claimed that she had a miscarriage and sought treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and she died on the morning of the 4th. After examining her condition, the doctor determined that it was definitely not a miscarriage but was caused by a forced abortion. He reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Li Xiujian and take him to the police station. The French police station dispatched Detective Bu Zhenglong to arrest the midwife, Li Wang, and sent the body to the coroner's office. The Second Special District Court sent personnel to investigate and confirm the cause of death. Since no family members of the deceased could be found, the body was buried by a charity organization. Meanwhile, the Chinese police station sent Li Wang and Li Xiujian to the Second Special District Court. The prosecutor, based on articles 306 and 308 of the Criminal Code regarding the crime of abortion, filed a public prosecution. These details have already been reported in the newspapers. Presiding Judge Sun Peng interrogated and concluded the case. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Judge Sun presided over the criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. Li Wang was sentenced to two years and four months of imprisonment for performing an abortion at the request of a pregnant woman, resulting in the woman's death. Li Xiujian was sentenced to two years and three months of imprisonment for instigating an abortion resulting in the woman's death. The number of days detained before the final judgment was determined, with two days of detention offsetting two days of imprisonment. Within the appeal period, both defendants will be held in the detention center pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Lu Fubao, a local resident, 26 years old, working as a member of the security corps in the Chinese district, lives at No. 156, Zhongzhou Road, Zhabei. He recently had a daughter named Xuezhen, just over a month old. A white growth suddenly appeared on the child's gums, commonly known as "mantis eggs." Lu hired Ma Pan, a kind person and a midwife living at No. 622, Chen Da Lane, Ju Tong Road, to treat the child. The condition did not improve, and after being sent to the hospital, she died. The Hongkou Police Station, upon receiving the report, ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office on Avenue Foch. The First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Lian, along with a forensic doctor, to examine the body. Since the cause of death could not be determined from the external appearance, and fearing that the midwife's treatment was negligent and led to death, for the sake of caution, it was ordered that an autopsy be performed for a detailed examination. This was reported in this newspaper a few days ago. Yesterday morning, the forensic doctor of the First Special District Court completed the autopsy. It was found that the child died of hemophilia. The diagnosis by Ma Pan had no bearing on the death. Therefore, Prosecutor Guo and others went to the office to inform the relevant police station and the family of the deceased of the above situation. It was concluded that the deceased girl, Lu Xuezhen, died of hemophilia. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Han Xuezhong, from Gaoyou, 21 years old, a dockworker, lives in a simple shed without a number at the southern end of Ao Jiazhai Road, Peidong. His wife, Yang, 23 years old, has a two-year-old son. The couple had a good relationship. On the 17th of this month, Han's brother-in-law visited for the first time and brought lucky money of eighty cents, distributing it to Han's son and the neighborhood children. At that time, Yang collected forty cents. In the evening, Han's mother thought that Yang should not keep all the money and wanted to get twenty cents back from her. Because of this, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law started arguing. Unexpectedly, Han's mother became angry and grabbed Yang's hair, hitting her slightly. Yang was angry and cried in bed. When Han returned home from work, he also blamed her for disobeying his mother. Yang became even more angry. The next evening (the 18th), Han suddenly saw that Yang's body was slightly swollen and she was mentally unclear, as if she had taken poison. He hurriedly sent her to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. The hospital diagnosed that her condition was critical and could not be saved. She was carried back home and died at 8 a.m. At that time, Han and his mother both fled in fear. It was not until evening that a neighbor reported it to the Peidong Public Security Bureau. The bureau, considering the case involved a human life, immediately summoned the local leader, Zhang Dunlong. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., Zhang requested the local court to send Prosecutor Kong to conduct an on-site examination. There were no injuries on the surface. To clarify the truth of the death, it was decided to have the body transported to the Zhenru Examination Institute today for an autopsy. The deceased's husband also surrendered to the Pudong branch yesterday to await questioning. According to nearby neighbors, the deceased seemed to have died from swallowing sulfur ore.</p>

<p>Chen Dimin, a wealthy businessman currently living at No. 15, Lafayette New Village, Route Lafayette, in the French Concession, is 43 years old this year. He used to be a comprador for a foreign firm. He married Tan Kunfan from Wuxing (39 years old this year). They have been married for nearly 20 years and have six children, two sons and four daughters. The couple's relationship has always been very good. Ten years ago, Chen took Hu Luo'e, a prostitute from Suzhou (31 years old this year; her sister was once elected the first Flower Queen), as his concubine. They lived together in Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. However, two years ago, disagreements arose. Chen stopped visiting and ignored Hu. Hu was forced to file a petition with the Second Special District Court, requesting a support order. This was previously reported in the newspaper. After the trial, the court ordered Chen to pay her 1,000 yuan. Chen was not satisfied with the original judgment and is now appealing to the Third High Court. On February 27 of this year, Chen and his wife, Chen Tan Kunfan, suddenly had an argument over a trivial matter and began fighting. After family members intervened, Tan Kunfan angrily took her three or four daughters and left home to live with her mother. Relatives and friends repeatedly mediated and tried to persuade her to return, but Tan refused. Chen then hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for reconciliation. Chen Tan Kunfan also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Hua Maosheng. Yesterday, Judge Li Liang of the Second Special District Court opened the seventh civil court for mediation.

<h3 id="e180">Report from the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association on Sending Relief Workers to Liyang <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association on Renji Road, due to the severe drought and spring famine in various places, has been working together with the Jisheng Association and other charitable organizations. However, both financial and human resources are severely insufficient. Liyang is in urgent need of relief. The association has specially transferred Mr. Yu, a relief worker stationed in Changzhou, to assist Mr. Li Yunmen, the director dispatched to the area, in investigating the situation. According to Mr. Yu's report, the association is responsible for relief in the first, second, third, and sixth districts of Liyang, together with the Jisheng Association. The first, third, and second districts are the most urgent. At this time of year, when the old crops have run out and the new crops have yet to come in, the disaster victims are mainly filling their stomachs with wild vegetables and Guanyin soil. Recently, they have exhausted everything they can dig up and are resorting to eating grass and tree bark. Entering their homes, the pungent smell of grass is unbearable. Many of those who fled to Wuxi and Changzhou have been sent back. Deaths from starvation occur in every village, and refugees are everywhere, a truly miserable sight. The situation in the first, second, third, and sixth districts is particularly urgent. If relief is delayed any longer, the consequences will be unthinkable. The best way to provide emergency relief is to distribute relief tickets. Sometimes, when people are about to die of starvation, giving them soybean cakes can immediately turn the situation around. Having witnessed the truth with his own eyes, he cannot remain silent. The association feels that both financial and human resources are lacking and urgently hopes that all sectors of society can provide assistance to save these remaining lives.</p>

<p>(1) Chen Zhengfa, from Ningbo, 20 years old, checked into room 14 of the Xiaohua Runhua Hotel on Zhejiang Road on the 12th of this month and showed no unusual behavior. However, at about 12 p.m. yesterday, a tea boy from the hotel, seeing that he had not yet gotten up, went to check on him. He found Chen lying stiffly in bed, barely breathing. A Lysol bottle was found next to the bed, indicating that he had taken poison. The police were notified, and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. His condition is very critical. (2) Yin Chuntong, from Zhenjiang, checked into the Shengtai Hotel on Tianjin Road on the 14th. He claimed to be 28 years old. The hotel assigned him room 20 for his stay. However, at about 7 a.m. yesterday, a tea boy from the hotel suddenly discovered that Yin had secretly swallowed sleeping pills in his room to commit suicide. The police were immediately notified, and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Due to the overdose of poison, his life is in danger. (3) At about 8:30 p.m. yesterday, a bathhouse customer, about 40 years old, went to the Shuangfeng Pavilion Bathhouse at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Fujian Road to take a bath. After he finished washing, he lay on the pit bed and read a newspaper. The bathhouse attendants suddenly saw that his expression changed drastically and he was breathing heavily. He then became breathless and seemed about to die. The attendants were greatly shocked and reported it to the police. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The body was sent to the coroner's office to determine if he had been poisoned. Without an examination, it is impossible to know the cause of death.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Going to See Peonies: Nanjing Linggu Temple, Guojiadou in Punan, Songjiang <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The peony is the king of flowers, but it is difficult to cultivate, and good varieties are extremely rare. In addition to the peonies at Chongxiao Temple in Beiping, which are famous (but still far from blooming), the peonies in Linggu Temple in Nanjing have many valuable varieties and are highly regarded. In addition, the Qin family courtyard in Guojiadou Village, Punan, Songjiang, has peony plants that were left over from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, more than 300 years ago. Despite repeated changes, only this plant remains. Its quality is extremely high, the flowers are as big as bowls, and the petals are deep red and purple, exquisite and brilliant, rare in the world. People with a fondness for peonies in Nanjing and other places often travel long distances to see them when they bloom. According to a person from the village, the peonies in Qin's collection already have seven or eight buds and are expected to bloom by the end of this month. It takes about four hours to hire a private boat from Songjiang to Yinyin, and a 45-minute walk from the shore to Guojiadou Village. The round-trip boat fare is about two yuan. During this beautiful spring season, there will be many people going to Linggu Temple and Guojiadou to see the flowers.</p>

<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>China's publishing industry has never had a publishing plan from the beginning, relying entirely on market needs to publish books on a case-by-case basis, which is similar to market speculation. This is because large bookstores have never thought of publishing books in a planned way, while small bookstores, although consciously wanting to have a plan, are limited by their financial resources and cannot do so. Moreover, most small bookstores take large bookstores as their standard, following their steps closely and imitating them without any hesitation. Therefore, China's new book industry, since the Commercial Press pioneered it, many subsequent companies have been similar to the Commercial Press, rarely specializing in one type of book and establishing their own unique style. Because of this, the competition between them in the market is extremely fierce. This can still be dealt with when the market is active, but when the market is sluggish, it becomes difficult to find books to publish.</p>
<p>Because books lack sales, the idea of a publishing plan came to mind, but this so-called plan, based on recent market performance, seems to be more of a lazy and inherited mindset than an active and creative tendency. For example, the reprinting of large collections of ancient books and the compilation of so-called libraries are mostly based on existing books, piecing them together. This is a makeshift solution, so if it is said that this is intended to open up a new situation, it would be better to say that it is maintaining the status quo in order to cope with this sluggish market, which is still equivalent to having no plan. However, even this kind of unplanned approach cannot be undertaken by large bookstores with considerable financial resources, let alone small bookstores.</p>
<p>For the present, if we want to create a new situation and contribute a corresponding effort to our own business and to the culture of the nation, then first, I believe that we must break the habit of following the crowd. When we see that a certain bookstore is publishing a book that sells well, everyone comes to publish that book. Second, each bookstore should be able to distinguish itself and specialize in a certain type of book. In general, the more specialized the division of labor in a production industry, the better the quality. I think the publishing industry should also be like this. Especially for small bookstores, which are limited in their ability, there is no need to model themselves after the Commercial Press, trying to do too much and gather everything together. In this way, competition between them can be eased, and there is the possibility of cooperation. Third, in today's developed production, as a rule, producers and distributors must divide labor, and there is no reason to produce and sell by oneself. Therefore, I believe that if small bookstores want to survive in this sluggish situation, it is necessary to jointly establish a common retail outlet in order to save expenses and concentrate management. Only in this way can we prevent the manipulation of intermediaries in other cities, which will benefit readers' purchases.</p>
<p>As for large publishers, I believe that with their strong financial resources, they do not need to compete with small bookstores, but should set their own publishing plans. To be honest, we now have all kinds of books in fragments, without systematic editing and printing. For example, in literature, do we have a literary history and works that include ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign? Therefore, introductions to the literary history of various countries and eras, as well as the works of various important writers, are the most needed at present. Not only in literature, but also in politics, economics, philosophy, science, etc., it is the same. In the vertical aspect, we need a systematic historical introduction, and in the horizontal aspect, we urgently need a clear understanding of different categories. This can only be done with the abilities of fire publishers.</p>

<p>We should not be fatalists, we should do and we should think of ways to correct. Fundamentally, we must seek production development. And how to obtain the possibility of production development, such as enabling tariffs to be completely autonomous in order to protect nascent production, is also a problem, and it cannot be solved in the short term. Does the publishing industry stop at this time to wait? Or continue to operate? I think it should operate. This is like workers who still have to live and have to do things to improve their current lives before a fundamental solution is found.</p>
<p>On the other hand, everything is done by people. If we do not understand our own shortcomings, we can continue to do it in the same old way. But once we understand, we should not only reform, but we also have the possibility to do so. There is room for free will here. We are not unconscious animals, we want to consciously practice and pursue the purpose we desire.</p>
<p>Here, I first feel that it is entirely possible to publish more philosophy and science books and fewer ancient books. The only question is whether the people in charge of various aspects of the publishing industry, such as the editors-in-chief of bookstores, understand the pros and cons of this. Regarding this point, I would like to discuss it in another article. Here, I treat the problem as if it has been solved. From now on, we will publish more philosophy, science books, and even literature books.</p>
<p>Of course, there are fewer buyers for advanced works. But I think it will increase. In any case, education and production are developing, albeit slowly. There is also some progress in research facilities and efforts. Although these are not enough, they can always add a bit of purchasing power. On the other hand, fewer ancient books will shift the purchasing power of ancient books to this aspect. Therefore, advanced works also have considerable sales.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of publishing more philosophy, science books, and their advanced works, I believe that publishing entrepreneurs cannot completely stand in a passive position and only seek to supply objective needs. We must understand that publishing entrepreneurs are the conditions for creating the objective needs of researchers. Without new-style novels, people can only read old-style novels. With new-style novels, people will buy them and read them. Need arises from existence. The need to take the train comes from the existence of the train.</p>
<p>As for the problem of increasing quantity, it is related to funding. If the sales and production of the above-mentioned books are not commensurate, money is also needed to turn around. What to do? I think publishing entrepreneurs in all aspects should unite to demand subsidies. Since culture is important, and construction and revival are to be sought, publishing subsidies can be included in the legitimate expenditures of the state. Rather than spending money to support redundant agencies, it is better to abolish some and transfer people to translation and writing, and transfer money to publishing subsidies to be converted into royalties or royalties to pay them. There is still meaning.</p>
<p>To develop culture, it is necessary to develop the publishing industry. Therefore, after reviewing the publishing industry, I put forward my expectations. I hope that those engaged in publishing and culture will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Casual Talks on Everyday Psychology <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zu Shun</p>
<p>Dr. Jeeph Jastrow Translated by Zeng Baochi</p>
<p>Life Bookstore Price: One Yuan</p>
<p>Every year, when a new class of students comes into the classroom, I always give them a test—regarding their general state of mind. What surprises me is that among these college students in their prime, so many are pessimistic; they feel hopeless about their future, and there are many things in society that make them helpless—afraid, and feel the pain of the contradiction between thought and life. Several people even deeply feel their shortcomings and sincerely discuss rescue methods with me. Although I have also read a few psychology books, I cannot think of any principles or rules that can help them.</p>
<p>When I saw the book "Casual Talks on Everyday Psychology," I flipped through its table of contents, which seemed to be very related to several questions I often thought about in my heart. However, after reading it in detail, I was disappointed. It was not because it did not answer my questions. Originally, this end-of-the-century disease cannot be cured not only by this young psychology, but even philosophy, although it is more effective than psychology, is not a good prescription for removing the root of the disease. These sad youth, unless they understand that they should be doctors themselves to help people—after discovering the real root of the disease—they will not be saved. Psychology is powerless, and at the same time, it is certainly not to blame this book.</p>
<p>My disappointment with this book is that what it says is too limited to "psychology." The author absolutely does not separate the influence of social organization on individual psychology, so that what is achieved is very limited. Although it is such a thick book, I still want to introduce this book to people who want to know what psychology is and who are deterred by the nerve organization, stimuli, and reactions in psychology textbooks. Here, the author talks about everyday life in a plain and unremarkable way, without talking about any laws or proposing any rules, but after you read it, in many aspects, you can indeed understand yourself and people's behavior "psychologically." You will know how a small action or habit hides a very serious or very interesting meaning.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, the author mostly analyzes without giving answers. Occasionally, his sermons are not very sound and are too submissive to the social status quo. For example, the Professor Bokham children's mental health rules he cites say that children should be made to believe in religion and revere the master of heaven and earth: and when explaining that cousins can marry, he cites the story of Sarah and Abraham in the Old Testament as one of the bases, which is simply as ridiculous as Kang Liang citing "Three years without changing the way of the father, it can be called filial piety" to advocate that the ancestral laws can be modified.</p>
<p>There are several sections in this book that can be specially introduced, such as the following sections. In the first chapter; section 10, how to fill the deficiencies in your soul; section 12, the tragedy caused by fixation; section 18, stubbornness; in the second chapter; section 10, fatigue is a dangerous symbol for children; section 16, should it be beaten or should it not be beaten; section 17, degenerate; in the third chapter; section 3, why do you want to act; section 6, do you hate people; in the fourth chapter; section 7, the relationship between mood and work: in the sixth chapter, the ingenuity of makeup; in the tenth chapter: section 11, the subconscious and habits, etc. These sections are all written well, but I always feel that they could be written better.</p>
<p>Regarding the translation, the second half seems to be better than the first half. There are several terms that can be discussed, such as translating Forgetting as amnesia.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Introduction to Bacon's "New Organon" (Continued) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Du Ruoyi</p>
<p>Published by Xin Ken Bookstore Translated by Shen Yinming</p>
<p>"New Organon" is Bacon's masterpiece. Even his most critical critics cannot but say: "Bacon's greatest work is the first volume of "New Organon"" (Macaulay). Before Bacon, the only method of studying science was Aristotle's logic—that is, syllogism. In this book, Bacon advocated a new logic, namely induction, which was completed by John Stuart Mill. It is a major feature of modern research methods, which was not available in medieval research methods. Bacon's original plan was to attempt a comprehensive work called "The Great Instauration", divided into six parts: the first part was an overview of the intellectual state at the time; the second part discussed how to correctly use the intellect when explaining nature; the third part reclassified the various phenomena of the universe as materials applicable to the new method; the fourth part explained the application of the new method and its results; the fifth part narrated the facts achieved by the author in natural philosophy using his original method; and the sixth part was the prediction of the results of applying the new philosophy, that is, the new method, to all phenomena in the universe. However, most of this plan was never completed. Only the first part became "The Advancement of Learning" and the second part became "New Organon" and was realized. The others were all fragments, and the sixth part was never written at all. Therefore, the book "New Organon" is only a part of "The Great Instauration", and even the book itself was not completed. According to the author in section 21 of the second volume of this book, the problems to be discussed in this book are: (1) specially selected examples: (2) inductive supports: (3) inductive revisions; (4) research methods vary according to the nature of the topic; (5) the nature of specially selected examples: (6) the scope of research; (7) application; (8) preparation for research: (9) the stages of axiomatic decline, etc., but only one specially selected example is actually discussed in this book: other items are not only not mentioned in this book, but also not found in other works.</p>
<p>This book is written in Latin. The content is divided into two parts: the first part refutes Aristotle's style of argumentation and points out the shortcomings of various previous theories. This can be said to be "intellectual cleansing", which is "breaking evil". In the second part, he put forward his new logic, which is "manifesting the correct". Therefore, the defect of this book lies in the second part, but the first part also has many points of interest, such as explaining the arrival of a new era in science and the theory of idols, etc.</p>
<p>Bacon has an immortal slogan: "Knowledge is power". His entire thought is an expansion and completion of this concept. Bacon realized that all the knowledge that humans have always possessed is useless. But he believed that knowledge could originally become a power. He saw that the existing knowledge in the world—especially the knowledge about nature—had no results and was not reliable. With this kind of knowledge, humans cannot control nature. Therefore, he felt hopeless about the previous sciences. But he believed that if humans could use new methods, the highest power to control nature could be restored. However, to use new methods, it is necessary to completely abandon the medieval doctrines and rules. People must be like infants, not infected by any doctrines or ideas, cleanse all prejudices and reduce the idols (Idols) in their hearts.</p>
<p>The idol that Bacon said refers to a false image being regarded as an entity, and an idea being regarded as a physical object. He believed that idols are the source of all fallacies, and the types of idols can be divided into four, namely "idols of the tribe", "idols of the cave", "idols of the market", and "idols of the theater".</p>
<p>Bacon's theory has had a very great impact on European culture. His era was just after the dark ages of the Middle Ages. European knowledge increased, and terror decreased; people worshiped "unknowable" thoughts less, and I won more unknowable thoughts. All the spirits of life were inspired by a new belief; obstacles were overthrown. This was an era of success, hope, and vitality; an era of new beginnings and new undertakings in all fields: this era was waiting for a call, and needed a comprehensive mind to summarize its spirit and judgment. This was Bacon. 、</p>
<p>In short, Bacon is the most powerful mind in modern times. His theory is very important. Now, his masterpiece "New Organon" has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Shen Yinming, so that Chinese students can directly understand his theory. This is a very good thing. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e204">World Games Weightlifting Rules – Translation and Publication by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation for Training and Reference of Domestic Martial Arts Practitioners <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Our country's weightlifting (stone lock and stone dumbbell), and the weightlifting competition specified in the World Games program are largely the same in method, but their application of movements and competition rules have special regulations. Only through legal training and considerable experience can one compete in strength. The National Amateur Athletic Federation has specially translated and published the general rules of weightlifting competition and training rules in the World Games, for the training and reference of domestic martial arts practitioners. The rules are as follows (these English rules have been reviewed and approved by the International Weightlifting Federation and reviewed, approved, and adopted by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation):</p>
<p>(1) Lifting Rules</p>
<p>First Type: Two-Handed Press</p>
<p>First Movement: Place the bar horizontally in front of you, grasp it with both hands, and with a simple and clear movement, take one leg into a half-lunge or a bent-leg bouncing stance, lifting the bar to shoulder height, then pause with the bar resting on the chest or close to the upper arms. Move both feet closer on a straight line to a distance of no more than 40 centimeters.</p>
<p>Second Movement: After completing the first movement, hold still for two seconds, then use both arms simultaneously to slowly lift the bar upwards (without using quick movements to gain momentum) until both arms are fully extended. Hold still in this position for two seconds. During this upward movement, the athlete's head and body should remain on a vertical line at all times. (Important Point) After completing the first movement, the bar must touch the chest. After touching, do not start the upward movement before the referee signals (a pat is the signal). If the athlete cannot hold the bar on the chest, they should notify the referee before the competition. The basis for these athletes' initial upward movement should be at the point where the collarbone and sternum connect.</p>
<p>Illegal Movements: During the upward movement, if the athlete's head and body are not on a vertical line, the heels are raised, or the legs show a slight bend, these are all illegal movements.</p>
<p>Second Type: Two-Handed Snatch</p>
<p>Place the bar horizontally in front of you, grasp it with both hands, and with a simple and clear movement, snatch it up from the ground, lifting it over the head until both arms are vertically extended. Taking one leg into a half-lunge or a bent-leg bouncing stance is acceptable. The bar rises along the body, the movement is continuous and uninterrupted, and no part of the body other than the feet may touch the ground.</p>
<p>After lifting the bar, hold still for two seconds. The arms and legs must remain in their original position. The feet should stand on a straight line no more than 40 centimeters apart.</p>
<p>When performing this movement, the hands should extend directly from the shoulders, be on the same plane as the shoulders, and not move left or right. (Important Point) A single movement is the basic principle of this exercise. Do not delay the movement before the wrist rotates. The wrist should rotate after the bar passes overhead.</p>
<p>Third Type: Two-Handed Clean and Jerk</p>
<p>Place the bar horizontally in front, grasp it with both hands, and with a simple and clear movement, take one leg into a half-lunge or a bent-leg bouncing stance, lifting the bar to shoulder height. The bar should rest on the chest or close to the upper arms. The bar must not touch the chest before reaching shoulder height. After this, move both feet along a straight line, bend both legs, and with a sudden movement, straighten the legs and arms, pushing the bar up into a vertically extended position. In this final position, hold still for two seconds. The feet should be on a straight line, no more than 40 centimeters apart. The upward movement must not be re-tried.</p>
<p>(Illegal Movements) Using the knees to support the ground, or the bar touching any part of the body before reaching shoulder height, are illegal movements.</p>
<p>(2) General Competition Rules</p>
<p>(A) Whether pressing, snatching, or clean and jerking, there are no special restrictions on the leg movements when thrusting the chest or bouncing up. (B) When gripping the bar, it is absolutely forbidden to cover the last segment of the thumb with all four fingers together to gain an advantage. (C) If the results of the lifted weight are equal, the athlete with the lighter body weight wins the competition.</p>
<p>(3) Trial Lift Rules</p>
<p>(A) Each athlete has three attempts for each type of lift (not for each weight). (B) Each time the weight is increased, it must not be less than five kilograms. However, on the third attempt, they may be allowed to increase it by 2.5 kilograms. An increase of 2.5 kilograms indicates that it is their final attempt. (C) Each time the weight is attempted, it can be increased, but not reduced compared to the previous one. (If the first attempt is successful, the second attempt should be increased. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, the second attempt should be with the original weight, not reduced.) (D) All types of trial lifts should be held within a square area of four meters. (E) Each weight class of athletes can determine their own minimum weight, which the competition management prepares and places in the arena in advance. (F) Once the weight has been attempted, it must not be reduced. (G) Attempts held inside the trial lift area are considered official attempts. (H) If an attempt fails, the referee should grant a three-minute rest period before the second attempt. Before completing all types of attempts, the bar must not be taken out of the arena, except for increasing the weight. (I) Even if the movements are not perfectly aligned, but there is a clear tendency to lift, the referee may judge it as one attempt. Lifting the bar to knee height is also counted as one attempt.</p>
<p>(4) Heavy Bar Structure</p>
<p>The heavy bar consists of a steel round shaft with metal discs attached to each end (the total weight of the bar is adjusted by adding or removing discs). The gap between the shaft and the ground for heavy bars used in international competitions is at most 21.1 centimeters, and the diameter of the largest disc must not exceed 45 centimeters. The diameter of the shaft is 2.8 kilograms.</p>
<p>(5) Weight Classes</p>
<p>The weighing of each athlete's body weight is held before the competition, divided into five classes according to the following standards: Light, Junior Lightweight, Middleweight, Junior Heavyweight, and Heavyweight.</p>
<p>Lightweight: Body weight 60 kilograms (132.2 pounds) and below</p>
<p>Junior Lightweight: Body weight 67.5 kilograms (148.5 pounds) and below</p>
<p>Middleweight: Body weight 75 kilograms (165 pounds) and below</p>
<p>Junior Heavyweight: Body weight 82.5 kilograms (181.5 pounds) and below</p>
<p>Heavyweight: Body weight 8.5 kilograms (181.5 pounds) and above</p>
<p>(6) Penalties</p>
<p>Athletes with improper behavior or loud disputes should receive one warning. If they receive two warnings, they will be disqualified from the competition. If disrespectful or insulting behavior is discovered, they may be immediately disqualified without warning.</p>

<p>The Huaguang and Jiangnan track and field teams, considering the approaching All-China Games, have decided to hold a joint training competition at the Chizhi University track and field field on Jiangwan Water and Electricity Road this Sunday at 2 PM to prepare for the Games. The purpose of this training session is to improve team members and produce excellent results, with the competition being a practice match without rankings or scores. Both teams have many national-level athletes. Each athlete will focus on one or two events, rather than multiple events, which will lead to better results.

<h3 id="e211">Ministry of Education Order: Submit Reports on Nursing Vocational Schools <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The Ministry of Education ordered all departments to state that nursing education is a type of vocational education facility. The Ministry previously decided to follow the regulations for vocational schools and established temporary regulations for senior nursing vocational schools, ordering compliance. However, many of the vocational school survey forms reported by the provinces and cities did not include this type of school, and many privately established schools were not registered according to regulations. Therefore, all public and private hospitals in the provinces and cities that have nursing schools, training classes, or training institutes, totaling more than 160, should quickly investigate and clarify the situation within their jurisdiction and complete registration by the end of this month. Those that do not meet the senior level should also fill out the forms and submit them for approval. In addition to following the regulations for private schools and filling out various forms, they should also report a summary of the teaching hospitals for evaluation. Furthermore, if there are already public senior nursing vocational schools or nursing departments affiliated with schools in the provinces and cities, they should be identified and reported to the Ministry for reference within two weeks of receiving this document. Compliance and reporting are required.</p>
<h3 id="e212">City Education Bureau Issues List of Self-Study Books for Summer School Students; Submission of Notes Required on Schedule; Reading to Commence Immediately <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all municipal and registered private primary schools in the city, stating: "Regarding the regulations for the Education Bureau's summer school for primary school teachers and staff, they have been revised and promulgated. As Article 4 of these regulations stipulates that 'students should engage in self-study before enrollment, based on a reading list of books for various subjects provided by the Bureau; each student should select and read books from the designated list for each subject, and create notes to be submitted for review upon the opening of summer school,' the Bureau hereby issues a list of self-study books for students of this year's summer school. All students who are to enroll from each school must strictly adhere to the regulations, carefully assess their own academic abilities, and commence purchasing and reading books immediately. Each subject should involve reading at least 80,000 characters, and notes must be submitted on schedule. However, as the list of books for each subject offered this year may not fully suit the level of all students, permission is granted for students to select and read other similar books with approval, in addition to the designated list. Notes, however, must still be submitted uniformly. No excuses or delays should be made. As this concerns the self-improvement of students, all school teachers and staff should diligently comply. The principals of each school bear the responsibility for leadership and supervision, and should especially lead by example and diligently carry out these duties. Further regulations regarding the registration procedures and the establishment of addresses for the summer school, as well as admission tickets, will be announced later. For now, a list of self-study books for students of this year's summer school is issued for compliance. Do not neglect this order."

<p>Yesterday marked the tenth day of the National Reading Movement Conference, organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. The association specially invited Professor Zhang You San of Jinan University to broadcast a lecture on "How to Study Education" on the Sino-Western Radio Station. The full transcript of Zhang You San's lecture is as follows:</p>
<p>First Determine the Standpoint: The invitation from the Cultural Construction Association asks about how to study education. First, it is necessary to determine from what standpoint to study, and then we can talk about how to study. Because education is a subject that everyone should care about. Education is a process in society that carries on the past and opens up the future. Everyone in society should study education. Those who are fathers and brothers in the family have the responsibility to educate their children and should also learn a little about the principles of education. If we are willing to engage in education, then we must study education. However, those engaged in education can also be divided into two categories. One category is ordinary teachers. Their study of education only needs to be a general understanding. The other category is education experts. They take the study of various issues in education as a lifelong career. Their research needs to be more in-depth. What I am talking about today is mainly for the research of experts. Others can also use it as a reference.</p>
<p>Scientific Research: There are three ways to study education. The first is the recognition of facts. This type of research can be called scientific research. Their research attitude is exactly the same as that of natural sciences. Their purpose is to collect all kinds of facts related to education to provide a factual basis for education. The facts to be collected in education can be roughly divided into three categories. One category belongs to the psychological, which is to seek a correct understanding of the individual's nature and its changes. The second category belongs to the social, which is to seek a correct understanding of the actual situation and needs of the society. The third category belongs to education itself, which is to seek a correct understanding of the implementation of education and its impact and results. There are many inventions in education about the methods of collecting facts. I can briefly give a few examples. One is the observation method. The difference between scientific observation and ordinary observation is that the former is more precise. How can it be precise? That is to determine the scope of the observation object and only focus on observing one thing at a time, and record what is observed at any time, so naturally it can be precise. The three categories of facts mentioned earlier can all use the observation method. The observation method has evolved into a tracking method. This is also a kind of observation, but the effect of education is often not visible in the present, but must be expressed after many years. For example, using an educational method to educate gifted children, whether this method is suitable for the cultivation of genius must wait until these genius children have grown up to be expressed. Therefore, we must patiently track for several years to see the results. The second is the consultation method, which is to prepare a consultation form (also known as a questionnaire) or send it to the person being consulted and ask them to fill it out, or record the questions face-to-face. This method is suitable for investigating the implementation of education and soliciting the opinions of experts. However, when compiling the consultation form, the scope and nature of the questions need to be written clearly, and it should be easy for the person being consulted to fill it out. The third is the analysis method. For example, business analysis is to analyze a certain special business in life into the most detailed activities, so as to help individuals choose a career or prepare for personal life. The analysis method also includes a diagnostic method. This is an analysis specifically used to discover the individual difficulties of students in order to apply remedies. The fourth is the statistical method. General facts are often messy. If they are not sorted out, they will not show any meaning. After statistics, you can see the distribution situation, understand the central tendency and the dispersion tendency, and thus determine the reliability of the material. There is a method in statistics called counting method, which is to seriously count the number of times a certain type of fact is discovered and see how many times it is to determine the level of its importance. For example, to investigate primary school students writing wrong characters, which characters are the easiest to write wrong, it is best to check one by one from the primary school students' composition books and other works, and calculate the number to get an objective answer. The fifth is the verification method. This method can be divided into two types. A is the testing method, which is most suitable for measuring the characteristics of personality and the personality differences between people. B is the experimental method, which is to try a problem that you want to solve in the field, and then see the effect. The scientific research methods mentioned above require specialized research and must have received scientific training, have an objective attitude, meticulous analysis, and need to have a foundation in statistical knowledge. Not only must they have received considerable training when doing their own research, but also if they have not been trained, even articles written by others with discussions or reports, some of the terms in them are not easy to understand.</p>
<p>Philosophical Research: The second method of studying education is the establishment of educational ideals. This method can be called philosophical research. Education should indeed be based on facts, but it should not be bound by facts. Education not only maintains the existing culture, but also improves the old culture and creates a new culture. It should have an ideal for the future society and the future individual. How is this ideal established? Of course, it is necessary for people with a solid foundation and a broad vision to be able to set a valuable ideal. This kind of research cannot only be learned from education itself, but must have an understanding of various academic issues, especially economics, politics and other academic disciplines. After having a very deep research, and then using a comprehensive perspective, can we set the goal of education. This can be called the method of synthesis. Secondly, we must know that history is continuous, and all social systems have their past origins. If we do not understand the past, we cannot understand the trend of evolution. Therefore, to study education, we must use the historical method. The third is the comparative method, that is, the systems and theories of various countries, etc., that can be used for my reference should be studied. Then, we can determine the educational ideals needed at this time and place. The philosophical method includes synthesis, history, and comparison as one method. Before studying education in this way, we should first put in some effort in social science. Because education is science, it needs precise analysis. Because education is philosophy, it needs broad synthesis. People who study education need to be both precise and broad. American-style education focuses on scientific research, and European-style education focuses on philosophical research. In fact, both are important and cannot be neglected. However, researchers may as well consider the similarity of their personality and focus on one aspect.</p>
<p>Practical Research: As for the third type of research, it can be called practical research. Its role is to start from the facts and return to the ideal, how to cross the middle, and what steps are required. This part of education belongs to the department of methodology. The methodology I am referring to here is broad, and can include education, administration, school organization, management, selection of teaching materials, teaching methods, and so on. Although there are many theories to explore these issues, they should be thoroughly sought from practice.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Finance: Call Loan Rate Still at One Percent <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Easter, and foreign firms and banks were uniformly closed for three days. However, the majority of Chinese firms operated as usual. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Commercial Bank of China also remained closed as in the past. As a result, the overnight call loan rate weakened and fell back to only 0.2%, although it later improved to 0.3%, still down 0.3% from the previous day. Since Hui merchants do not usually engage in this practice, the situation remains exceptionally stable, with the rate remaining at 1% throughout the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous market. Call loan transactions amounted to over 3.3 million yuan in morning transfers, with over 400,000 yuan in new transactions. Afternoon transactions amounted to over 100,000 yuan. Transactions in the small general association amounted to over 400,000 yuan. Redemption of foreign mortgage loans amounted to over 600,000 yuan, with over 800,000 yuan in new loans. Currency transactions saw the withdrawal of over 1.2 million yuan. On the issuing side, circulating notes amounted to over 800,000 yuan, marked notes amounted to 500,000 yuan, remittances to various locations amounted to 400,000 yuan, customer sources amounted to 200,000 yuan, and outgoing remittances amounted to 150,000 yuan. According to banking clearing reports, Chinese banks cleared over 2.1 million yuan in ticket payments, and various goods, remittance mortgages, tax sundries, etc., totaled over 2.9 million yuan, with 200,000 yuan entering the warehouse. Foreign public bond receipts from money houses amounted to over 21 million yuan, foreign exchange clearing amounted to over 1.8 million yuan, and cash clearing amounted to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar remained at 836 yuan in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Transactions amounted to only 2,000 jiao in the morning, with no activity in the afternoon. Although transactions in the Guangdong small silver dollar were not bad, due to repatriation, the opening price in the morning immediately fell by 1.4 yuan to 734 yuan. The afternoon saw a further small decline of 0.1 yuan, changing to 733.9 yuan. The result was a decrease of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 145,000 jiao in the morning and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were also the same as in the previous market, remaining at 336,000 wen. The transaction volume was 32,256 strings of wen, amounting to 9,600 yuan. In addition, the total amount exchanged at the local bill exchange was 7,294,659.89 silver yuan, including 4,256,991.18 silver yuan in cash, 3,037,668.71 silver yuan in remittances, and other transactions were clear, with only slight fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Securities: 96 Bond Suffers Greater Losses; Other Transactions Stagnant with Minor Fluctuations <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange remained largely inactive. Both buyers and sellers were primarily engaged in speculative transactions, with few new trades executed. The steadfastness of both sides was rarely seen in recent months. Arbitrage trading failed to generate interest due to low interest rates and tight credit conditions. Market prices remained weak, flickering and uncertain. However, groundless rumors concerning the 96 Bond, mostly fabricated by bears under heavy pressure, caused some selling by Northern firms, ultimately proving to be unnecessary anxiety. With only three days remaining in the April futures, both sides remained entrenched, unable to maintain this stable stalemate. The market was extremely calm yesterday, with the opening price slightly weak at 0.05 yuan. Otherwise, the market was largely hazy and chaotic, with ups and downs fluctuating only around 0.1 yuan. As the range narrowed, transactions became clearer. However, the 96 Bond fell by 0.3 yuan and 0.45 yuan due to large sales by Northern firms numbered 11 and 35. The total turnover was 9,020,000 yuan, with the 96 Bond accounting for 4,910,000 yuan, more than half of the total volume, indicating potential future volatility. A comparative table of price fluctuations is presented below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported yesterday (the 18th) that the New York stock market, due to the dissipation of various pressures and the eagerness of bearish speculators to stay out of the market during the holidays, saw a surge in buying. Consequently, the market soared. High-grade stocks skyrocketed, led by Coca-Cola. The company's 1934 operating report was exceptionally good, and its stock surged $11 to reach $206, an all-time high for the stock. The Exchange Board did not approve closing the market this Saturday (April 20th). The bond market was mixed. Stocks on the small exchange were very firm. Total daily trading volume was 820,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e217">Yarn and Cloth: Few Deliveries, Continued Firmness in Yarn This Month <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is quiet, and the overall trend is still brewing. However, this month is expected to remain firm because the delivery period is approaching and sellers are not delivering actively. Therefore, the market appears solid. However, according to market sources, there are delivery reports of 700 bales of 20-count Golden Pagoda yarn, 500 bales of Double Fish yarn, and 300 bales of Lion yarn. However, after thorough investigation, the Golden Pagoda Yarn Factory may recall its yarn due to its low grade, and Double Fish is also hesitant.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster is Brewing</p>
<p>Before the opening of the marked yarn market, except for the near-term contract for this month, which was firm and expensive, the other months showed stagnant prices. However, the market generally believes that deliveries for this month are not rushing. A certain individual has a large amount, as many as four or five thousand bales, and still has no intention to close out his position. Therefore, general floating traders have no choice but to buy in, and the market is still able to stabilize. However, the price limit is 183.9 yuan, and there was a slight outflow. As a result, the near-term contract for this month rose 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far-term contracts did not change. In the afternoon opening, the market price for this month was strongly maintained, and there was a rumor of over one thousand bales for delivery. However, the market price was still not affected. As a result, the near-term contract for this month was the same as the morning closing price. Far-term contracts were heavily dumped, and the market sentiment was slightly weak. According to reports, Yuda sold 800 bales, Ruida 2,000 bales, Yongda 300 bales, Tonghe 800 bales, Runyuan 200 bales, and Hengchang 200 bales. Changfeng bought 800 bales, Tongji 700 bales, Xiecheng 300 bales, Xincheng 350 bales, Yuanda 250 bales, and Gengfeng 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Still Lack Progress</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales are still stagnant. According to statistics, all the buying firms only purchased 365 bales for the entire day. The market conditions are similar to the previous day. The buying amounts for each firm are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e218">The Marked Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Weak <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was stable in the morning but turned weak in the afternoon. However, the near-term market for this month suddenly showed signs of weakness. According to market sources, 2,000 dan of cotton have passed inspection at the Cotton Inspection Bureau. Another source said that Tongcheng Company has 4,000 dan. Samples of Tianjin rough cotton have been sent to the Inspection Bureau for testing. As a result, market sentiment has loosened.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao: Stable Morning, Weak Afternoon</p>
<p>Before the opening of the marked cotton market, the market generally believed that there were not many delivery shares for this month, and the market sentiment was stronger. General floating traders were active in hedging. However, Tongji came to sell more, and the market turned flat. As a result, there were no changes in any of the contracts compared to the previous day's closing price. U.S. cotton rebounded by more than ten points, and Indian cotton fell slightly by one rupee. The marked gold foreign exchange market was closed due to the Easter holiday in the Western world. In the afternoon, the market for near-term contracts suddenly showed weakness. Market sources said that Tongcheng Company had brought in 4,000 dan of rough cotton from Tianjin. This type of cotton has already been sent to the Inspection Bureau for review. The market sentiment was suddenly hit by this news, and it fell by 0.15 yuan. However, the far-term contracts were still high, rising by 0.05 yuan. According to reports, Tongji sold 1,000 dan, Hexing 700 dan, Yongchang 800 dan, Yongda 1,600 dan, Changfeng 1,200 dan, Xincheng 1,000 dan, and Ruiyuan 1,000 dan. Dafu bought 800 dan, Changfeng 800 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,000 dan, Dafeng 900 dan, Shenji 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan, and Yichang 900 dan.

<p>Raw Cotton Factory Needs Are Even Quieter</p>
<p>Actual cotton consumption is becoming more and more common. Factory needs are slightly stagnant. The source is 150 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>Lingbao Cotton 48.75 Yuan Shenxin Factory Received 167 Pieces of Spot Goods Sent to the Factory</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Rebounds After Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened lower due to unfavorable foreign telegraphic dispatches. Foreign merchants sold, and each month fell 3 to 11 points. Then, because there were not many sellers, the market price showed a slight rotation. In the afternoon, traders bought and short sellers hedged, and the market situation became firm again. The closing was stable. Spot prices rose 15 points, and futures prices rose 10 to 12 points. British cotton spot prices fell 6 points, and futures prices fell 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to a lack of buyers and long positions closing out. Pingguoer fell 1.25 rupees, Aomula fell 3 to 3.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 0.75 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 17th):</p>

<p>(Tianjin Communication) The market conditions in the Xihua cotton market in this city are flat. Foreign merchants are sluggish in purchasing due to unfavorable exchange rates, but the actual position has not fallen. Tongcheng bought 130 bales at a price of 35 yuan. Beiyang Textile Factory bought 77 bales at a price of 35 yuan. In addition, Shanxi cotton is trending strong, and factory purchasing is relatively smooth. Beiyang Factory bought 120 bales at a price of 44 yuan and another 120 bales at a price of 45 to 47 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month showed a flat initial trend, followed by a continuous rise, and then flattening again. With foreign wheat prices, both Chicago and Canada were slightly down by 0.08 to 0.10 yuan. When the prices opened, this month opened flat. Then, due to the current tight supply of actual flour, some small factories and outside speculators, seeing that the spring rains had been too long and fearing problems, rushed to hedge their positions. Most clients were long and did not want to sell, so the asking price steadily rose, reaching a high of 0.09 yuan. Deferred months also continued to rise by about 0.01 yuan due to smooth purchases by inland buyers. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month's prices were still very stable due to higher spot prices. Deferred months, however, were heavily sold by factories, and the weather turned sunny and milder, so from July onwards, prices uniformly retracted. Looking at the future, if the weather does not change, a bearish trend is expected. As a result, this month was still up by 0.015 yuan, May and June were unchanged, July fell by 0.01 yuan, and August and September each fell by 0.0125 yuan—sales sentiment was triggered for deferred months.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed a generally quiet trend after opening in the morning. With foreign wheat prices, both Chicago and Canada were only slightly down by 0.08 to 0.10 yuan. During the slack period, near-term and far-term trading was still active, and prices rotated with little gains or losses. Although there were reports of flooding in various provinces, it was not expected to cause problems with the wheat harvest, so sentiment was still peaceful. When the market opened in the afternoon, the weather was clear and sunny, and deferred flour had also retreated, so selling sentiment became smooth and sentiment turned negative. This month, due to the scarcity of deliveries, was still seeing high prices. As a result, this month rose by 0.04 yuan, July fell by 0.04 yuan, August fell by 0.06 yuan, and September fell by 0.06 yuan. The spot wheat market was still stable. Shandong Bengbu wheat opened at 4 yuan, and Hebei Ping wheat at 3.99 yuan, totaling 4,000 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source from each firm in the South Shanghai was particularly scarce, with only No. 16 and 17 arriving (totaling over 3,000 stones). At the start of the market, it was immediately tight. Sellers' bids were quite high, and the market prices for thick japonica and late rice saw frequent increases. The situation was very lively at the time. By the later market, only the Qingdao firm purchased over 400 bags, and the local street also saw a decline. The market situation at the close of the market was slightly subdued, but the prices of Jiangsu-Tongxiang firms, Nangang, etc., were still up by 0.15 to 0.20 yuan, and various late rice varieties were up by 0.20 yuan, and "Yin Bian Yuan Ting Xiu" (a brand name) was up by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Yesterday, in North Shanghai, the source of each route from Hebei, No. 30, was smooth for white japonica, and early cloth was acceptable. Market prices still wanted to be tightened. Mid-market sales were stagnant, and prices turned sluggish. There were few thin rice varieties and high-priced goods, and prices were still firm. Other goods were similar to before.</p>
<p>The situation for foreign guest rice was initially flat, then firm, and then turned hopeful again. After the market opened in the morning, the destocking of this guest was not very active. Also, foreign quotations had loosened, and foreign firms were releasing their stored rice at high prices, so the high-grade foreign rice was flat and lifeless. Then, the Changjiang firm in Hankou and Jiujiang started loading, and inland destocking was more active. Both the local street and other scattered firms responded, and the destocking of disaster relief households in various places was also massive. 38,000 bags of Saigon rice, 5,000 bags of small twisted rice, and 2,000 bags of Calabria brown rice were traded. 4,000 bags of Siam Mendang Annam japonica were also sold. A batch of Tianjin rice was sold new for the guest, with prices opening at 12.55 yuan to 12.20 yuan. Kicked by foreign rice, the previous asking price was cheaper, The total sales of various guest and foreign rice present goods in the city again exceeded 50,000 bags, and the market immediately changed from flat to tight. If destocking is strong today and tomorrow, the market price may have to increase again. However, previously fixed orders are expected to arrive in whole numbers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, manufacturers continued to inquire about soybeans. The trend of destocking in Guangdong and Shantou was no longer possible. There were still a few purchases in the local street, and sentiment was hesitant. Yesterday, 3 cars of Yingzhou beans were traded at a price of 3.65 yuan to 3.64 yuan, 2 cars of Quanhe beans were traded at a price of 3.8 yuan and 3.76 yuan, 1 car of Feihe beans was traded at a price of 3.51 yuan, 600 bags of Hanzha beans were traded at a price from 3.81 yuan to 3.71 yuan, 500 bags of Han Late beans were traded at a price from 3.69 yuan to 3.55 yuan, 100 bags of Yingou beans were traded at a price from 4 yuan to 3.95 yuan, 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow were traded at a price from 3.8 yuan to 3.65 yuan, and 50 bags of Haiyan Du beans were traded at a price of 4.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with Customs Gold still firm at 1.710, and rumors of a tax increase on May 1st, the trend was initially weak and then tight. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company tendered 3,100 bags of Guangdong raw white sugar: (1) 2,000 bags of high-quality sugar at a price of 17.3 yuan, (2) 1,100 bags of slightly lower quality sugar at a price of 17.2 yuan. As a result, only 10 bags were traded. However, the market sentiment in the association was tighter. The initial price of No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar was 17.2 yuan, and then rose to 17.25 yuan, up 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The initial price for re-export goods was 5.4 yuan, and then tightened to 5.5 yuan, but there was also a lack of goods. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 17.8 yuan, with some transactions. Mian white Zhenyu No. 1 was 16.7 yuan, and the trend was also tight. The rest were returned.</p>
<p>In other news, Dong Sugar had a large number of transactions in the past two days, with 7,000 bags opened by Zenghua and Mitsui, all of which were Yanshui Port factory car whites, including 3,000 bags opened first on the previous day, (4.5 temperature) 7.1 yuan (Japanese gold), (3.5 temperature) 6.9 yuan. Yesterday, 4,000 bags were opened successively, with the price rising 0.1 yuan, (4.5 temperature) 7.2 yuan, (3.5 temperature) 7 yuan, all of which are for May shipment.</p>

<p>White tung oil has been rising and falling repeatedly in the past month, with a wide range of fluctuations. It soars when it rises and plummets when it falls. Within a week, it rises and falls, and the price per dan fluctuates constantly by 5 to 6 yuan. Therefore, those engaged in this business find it difficult to cope with. Just two weeks ago, foreign firms in Hankou actually reached 41 yuan, but by the previous week, they had plummeted to 33 to 34 yuan. Last week, they added to 39 yuan. This week, they have seen a sharp fall again. According to a telegram received from Hankou yesterday, it has fallen to 36.2 yuan, and the situation is still difficult to establish a foothold. It is feared that 35 yuan is imminent. It is said that the reason is that the source from Changde is surging, and although the various foreign firms in Hankou are still interested in purchasing, they also want to lower the price, so Hankou firms are making transactions for Xiang tung at 21 taels of light money, revealing the fatigue of the market. However, in this era of booming export trade, it is often the case that a sharp rise follows a severe fall. This has been proven in the past, and it is generally believed that the price of 34 to 35 yuan, even if there is no possibility of a turnaround, also has a foothold. Therefore, in the current market, although it is said to be extremely tired, there is also a limit to how much further it can fall, because European and American countries still need goods, and it is common to purchase in large quantities during periods of fatigue. This is unpredictable. Although the business of foreign firms in the local area has seen some development in recent years, it is not as continuous as the source in Hankou, so transactions are sometimes available and sometimes not.</p>

<p>Power cloth had very wide sales and unusually high prices last year, and the distributors earned large profits. This year, imports of Power cloth flooded the market, and transactions have already been made in various places. The market price has indeed fallen sharply. Ordinary brands of solid-colored Power cloth are only selling for 3.6 yuan per yard, and patterned goods are 4.3 to 4.4 yuan, which is obviously due to too many orders being placed.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Hardware: German Tinplate is Out of Stock and Prices are Rising <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>German tinplate has recently become scarce in the market, and very few goods are arriving. Therefore, those holding the goods are very firm in their thinking. However, in the past two days, can factories have been searching everywhere for supplies, and Tianjin firms also have sales grounds, so the market goods are becoming increasingly scarce, and the valuation is soaring. Each box is selling for 19.5 yuan, which is 0.5 yuan higher than before. Although the overseas fixed price is still estimated at 34 shillings and 5 pence, there are no recent spot goods, so traders still feel confident. In addition, the prices of Italian and British goods remain largely unchanged due to different materials. British goods are valued at 28.75 yuan, and Italian goods are selling for 29.25 yuan.</p>

<p>Sui'an green tea in Zhejiang Province has always been the earliest to come out. This year, due to the cold weather, the tea buds are developing slowly. The tea farmers only started picking the tea the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a telegram came from that place saying that new first-batch green tea had been launched. Calculated according to the city scale, the market price opened at 60 yuan. Currently, tea merchants from all over are eager to get new tea, and demand is high. Also, because the weather is cold and deliveries are not active, the market is expected to go higher.</p>
<h3 id="e230">New Voices from the Anhui-Jiangxi Tea Market <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>After Grain Rain and approaching the Start of Summer, the tea market, traditionally a major export commodity, is once again entering its active season. Red and green tea merchants in Anhui and Jiangxi are busy strategizing and preparing to enter the market. A tense atmosphere surrounds the tea market in various production areas. Mountain dwellers who rely on tea for their livelihoods are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the "Tea God" to rescue them from poverty. However, with the overseas market experiencing a downturn, it is difficult to predict whether this year's tea market will be prosperous or bleak. The reporter will now provide an account of the recent tea industry activities in various production areas:</p>
<p>She County green tea is traditionally divided into foreign and domestic operations. Last year, those engaged in foreign operations suffered losses due to sluggish sales and price drops, regardless of the quality of their goods. Even though the first batch yielded a small profit, the overall result was still a deficit. Domestic tea operations focusing on scented tea suffered as routes to various provinces outside the customs were blocked, and the influx of Japanese tea into Shandong led to a decline in business. This year, foreign tea merchants, seeing no improvement in the overseas tea market, are only preparing to open about 40% of the operations compared to last year, with the rest adopting a wait-and-see approach. However, in the Choumu Cen and Wenzheng Mountain areas, some scented tea operations are still preparing to enter the market, and merchants from Hebei and Shandong are also bringing funds to the mountains to establish businesses and purchase tea. Although the market is more active than the foreign operations, it is only about 60% of what it was in previous years and cannot be considered bustling.</p>
<p>Tunxi is the center of the tea market in Huizhou. Since 1925, merchants have suffered repeated losses, with only a few years of small profits. In the end, they still lost more than they gained. Most of the dozens of tea merchants in the city are exhausted and lack the funds to sustain themselves. This year, only about twenty merchants have confirmed their plans to operate, while the rest are hoping for assistance from the warehouse operators and the financial sector to resume business. The decline in market activity is unprecedented. In the past, wealthy tea firms would lend money to tea vendors after Pure Brightness to cover the cost of tea picking and rice for food. Now, they are closing their doors and refusing to lend, leaving them helpless. Mountain dwellers, unable to secure loans from tea merchants, lack the resources to purchase rice, fertilizer, hire labor, and repair equipment. The stagnant atmosphere among warehouse operators, merchants, and mountain dwellers has left the Tunxi tea market without any signs of life.</p>
<p>Qimen black tea has suffered repeated setbacks, and tea merchants are impoverished due to heavy losses. However, as the economic lifeline of the county largely depends on tea, those tea firms that can muster the strength are struggling to resume business, hoping for some late-season gains. Currently, the new tea in the county is benefiting from the recent warm and rainy weather, and the tea buds are sprouting. White hair Mao Feng tea is ready for picking. Warehouse operators and tea merchants believe that the mountain prices may decrease this year, transportation is convenient, and tea inventories are low, so they are turning their pessimism into optimism. Various warehouses in Qimen have already started releasing funds, and the credit situation is more active than before. In addition, the Agricultural Bank of the Four Provinces is directly lending money to tea merchants. Although the financial situation is not as flexible as in previous years, it is still better than nothing. With this assistance, the tea firms are not exactly reviving, but it is estimated that about 180 tea firms in the county have resumed operations as of this ten-day period, a decrease of about 100 compared to last year.</p>
<p>Wuyuan green tea has excellent quality and taste and could command a high price due to its scarcity. However, the foreign merchants' appetite is weak. Although there are precious varieties, it is difficult to force them to purchase. Many of last year's high-quality eyebrow teas are still stored in Shanghai, unsold. The inventory of Shi Xiuxiu eyebrow tea is particularly large. The tea merchants have suffered losses and are unable to settle their accounts. The depth of their pain is beyond words. This year's new tea in various villages will be ready for picking at the end of the month. Fewer Shanghai warehouses are stationed in Wuyuan to release funds this year, with only Yong Shenchang no longer present. The rest are also adopting a wait-and-see approach. The tea market is relatively active only in the Beiyuan, Yanchuan, Wangcun, and Xichong areas, where preparations for operations, such as purchasing boxes, boards, firewood, and charcoal, are underway. Elsewhere, there is little news. In general, mountain dwellers lack the funds to hire labor to pick tea due to the lack of tea money released by the tea merchants and the high price of rice due to crop failures. Their predicament is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>In addition, Yushan green tea has the advantage of convenient transportation via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the banditry in the production area has been suppressed. It is said that several tea firms are planning to open operations, so the tea market is not without hope. In Dexing, the tea-producing areas have been disrupted by bandits for many years, and farmers have migrated to other regions. The tea trees are barren, and the local economy cannot be restored in a short period of time. Households with some assets currently have no intention of engaging in the tea industry.</p>

<p>— (Xu Haowu)</p>
<p>After a long spell of cold and gloomy weather, a sunny day joyfully carried me to the heart of Shanghai on a public bus.</p>
<p>The palatial and spacious Municipal Government building. The brightly colored Party flags fluttered atop the towering flagpoles in the gentle breeze.</p>
<p>Tourists, taking advantage of their leisure time, strolled up the stone steps in front of the building, admiring the Party emblem in the middle. Shedding their heavy winter clothes, their steps were light and nimble.</p>
<p>Clusters of pedicabs. Young men, intentionally skilled at riding, wore thin shirts and shorts, heads down, exerting their strength, the wheels whizzing across the wide surrounding roads.</p>
<p>The concession lived up to its name; it has dense markets and towering skyscrapers - international conspiracy, urban crime!</p>
<p>Stepping into the city center designed by our own people: exquisite new villages, smooth roads, lush green fields: neat and clean, full of the vitality of nature!</p>
<p>The city center nurtured by Shanghai, threatened by gunfire before its birth and battered by wind and rain after, should be gasping for breath. But, young as it is, it has the spirit of the Western nations. It wants to fight, it wants to compete. It wants a rational organization, perfect facilities, and an orderly cityscape. It wants to quickly, diligently, and actively bloom into a bright and splendid flower for Shanghai, to inspire the people and correct their perceptions.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Lamenting the Past at Hongyang Cave <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>About forty li northwest of Guihua City—now the capital of Suiyuan Province—is the foot of the Daqing Mountains, which are a branch of the Yin Mountains. The mountain only has a stone cave, which the locals call "Hongyang Cave." It is said to be the place where Jiao Zan and Meng Liang, generals of the Yang family, stole bones. It is said that: "The Song general Yang Jiye was trapped by Liao soldiers, and committed suicide rather than surrender. The Liao people hid Yang's body in Hongyang Cave. Generals Jiao Zan and Meng Liang stole the bones from eight caves and died in the cave. This is that place." The cave entrance is narrow but wide inside, winding and twisting, dark and bottomless. Some people have ventured deep into the cave with torches, ascending and descending along the walls. After walking for about ten miles, they gradually heard the sound of rushing springs, sounding like angry waves. The cold wind was biting, and they could not go any further, so they had to turn back midway. More than half a li west of the cave, there is a large tomb, which the locals identify as the tomb of Jiao Zan. The tomb base is very large, rising like a small hill, with several stone horses lying on the ground. The withered grass and setting sun create a desolate scene. Although the story comes from fiction, stroking the broken steles and lamenting the predecessors can evoke many emotions. To the south of Guihua City, there is also the well-known tomb of Han Zhaojun—Qingzhong—whose loyal soul and bones will forever be remembered. Even now, it still bears traces of resisting the enemy and making peace, adding much color to this ancient capital of the southern desert.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Boating on Xuanwu Lake <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lilin</p>
<p>The Spring God staggers down, and the earth puts on a dazzling coat. Red flowers, green trees, green mountains, and green water decorate the vast space. A heart that has been suffocated for a long time is filled with active spirit. Unwilling to waste the beautiful scenery and good times, I went with Luo Ben... to Xuanwu Lake for a stroll.</p>
<p>After leaving Xuanwu Gate, the swaying willows by the lake flirtatiously fluttered in the wind and waves. The vast white lake was filled with many boats, weaving back and forth. Overhead was a clear blue sky. Compared to the bureaucratically heavy Nanjing city, it felt like entering another secluded world. Hundreds of tourists and boat girls gathered by the lake, the clamorous sound waves vibrating violently in the space. The cars and horses on the road were like ants, carrying many tourists, speeding towards Wuzhou Park, indicating that the spring is bright and people are enjoying themselves in time!</p>
<p>We also hired a boat and served as boatmen ourselves, slowly rowing to the center of the lake. The water was clear, and the breeze seemed to be kissing the lake, rippling into fluctuating blue waves. The boat was really like a lotus leaf, gently floating on the surface of the lake. Nestled in the arms of nature. Wuzhou Park was quietly silent, allowing people to appreciate its artificially cultivated art. By the lake, several clumps of bamboo made the spring scenery pleasant. The grotesque city walls were like a winding serpent, crouching by the lake. In the distance, the towering mountains were arranged in a staggered array. Jiming Temple was like a palace standing tall on the horizon. The five continents were like five chess pieces, placed on the lake. The warm sunshine bathed the universe, giving people unlimited possibilities for existence. We boated all over the lake, giving me a deep understanding of Xuanwu Lake.</p>
<p>As night gradually fell, we leisurely embarked on our return journey.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Snapshots along the Zhengtai Railway <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>The benefits of transportation development are infinite. Switzerland, because both water and land transportation are very convenient, although located between Germany, Austria, Italy, and France, in the Alps, there are millions of tourists who visit every year, and the travel expenses amount to 100 million a year, making it Switzerland's main source of wealth. This is the best example; transportation barriers can often cause a nation to become numb; while convenient transportation can make a nation invigorated and full of vitality; if you say that Switzerland is driven by waterfalls, clear lakes, and beautiful valleys, all of which can attract tourists, then, in such a large China, whether mountains: there are the Five Sacred Mountains and Tiantai, Yandang, Mogan, Lushan, Huangshan, Emei, etc., or water: there are the Yellow River, Wei River, Pearl River, as well as West Lake, Tai Lake, Dongting, Poyang, etc.; can't they compete with each other?</p>
<p>However, because the first prerequisite is inconvenient transportation, the landscape is dimmed; especially in the inland areas with excellent scenery, the footprints of people from other provinces are only scattered.</p>
<p>On the morning of Children's Day, April 4th, a team of "Zhengtai Railway Snapshot Group" departed from Shanghai. The photographer Lang Jingshan temporarily invited his artist friends Zhong Shanyin, Huang Zhongchang, and Liu Xucang, four people to travel together. This is really a good trend in the lonely art world. I heard that Mr. Lang's trip was at the invitation of Mr. Zhu Jiqing, the director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau, to specially photograph the scenery along the 243-kilometer line from Shijiazhuang to Yangqu (Taiyuan), compile and print a special album to promote transportation; in this way, the magnificent scenic spots in the northern country are not allowed to be exclusively favored by the beautiful Jiangnan.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Watching Fish at Yuquan Temple <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— (Ji Chengxing)</p>
<p>When I came out of Mrs. Hu's house, I rode my bike alone to Yuquan.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the temple gate, I went to watch the fish.</p>
<p>The fish in the pool were swimming slowly. Because the water was very clear, I could see the bottom at a glance. I could almost count the scales of the big fish. The big ones were about fifteen or sixteen catties; the small ones were also as long as an adult's finger. The colors were also very different: some were red and yellow; some were red, yellow, and black; my favorite was the fat red carp; its mouth was the most beautiful, the fullness of its lips, and the swaying of its short temples in the water. They lived in the same environment, and I could not find any traces of estrangement. Sometimes they piled up in heaps, like our human pyramid; sometimes they kissed mouth to mouth, like we do. They did not fight, had no leaders, had no acts of aggression, and would not riot over the uneven distribution of food given by the tourists! How could this situation not make us humans feel disheartened!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Stone Bell Mountain and Shoe Mountain <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— (Old Bell)</p>
<p>Stone Bell Mountain is outside the East Gate of Hukou County, Jiangxi. On the top of the mountain, there are small stone blocks that make a "clang clang" sound when hit with bricks or small stones, similar to the sound of a morning bell in a temple. This is how "Stone Bell Mountain" got its name. I have repeatedly struck these stones with my cane and bricks, and the sound is clear and crisp, which is really strange.</p>
<p>The area on top of the mountain is not very large, but there are quite a few houses. There is a "Zhaozhong Temple" that is quite well-built, completely dedicated to the memorial tablets of generals who pacified the Hong Yang rebellion, such as Zeng Guofan. There are also many works by Peng Yulin, Hu Linyi, and others. There are also several Western-style houses, which were built when Du Xigui was the commander of the Navy. Now, a battalion of Marines is stationed there for a long time. However, the trees and flowers are not lush.</p>
<p>Taking a boat from Hukou directly into Poyang Lake, after traveling about twenty miles, you can see a small mountain that looks like a shoe, which is Shoe Mountain, named after its shape. The mountain is surrounded by water, and the scene will remind us of Little Lonely Mountain, but the height and area are smaller than Little Lonely Mountain. There is a Handao Nunnery on the mountain, and the idol enshrined is the Bixia Yuanjun on the Investiture of the Gods. According to a Taoist priest, this mountain was transformed from a shoe of the Bixia Yuanjun, which is really foolish and ridiculous.</p>
<p>There are many fruit trees and bamboos on the mountain, and wildflowers are all over the mountain, colorful and extremely beautiful. Standing on the top of the mountain, you can see the Five Elders Peak of Lushan Mountain, which is connected to the clouds, and the vast white Poyang Lake is also faintly visible.</p>
<p>According to the Taoist priest, Chiang Kai-shek once visited the mountain in the summer of the year before last, taking advantage of his inspection of the Yangtze and Poyang Lake defenses, and donated two hundred yuan to the nunnery.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Lushan Mountain and White Crane Spring <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— (Xie Mingcan)</p>
<p>Spring, or perhaps autumn, White Crane Spring has become a must-visit place for everyone who climbs the head of Lushan Mountain: despite the isolated and elegant Aiwanting Pavilion, with the most decorative buildings and maple trees all over the mountains and valleys, each shows its own strengths around it.</p>
<p>White Crane Spring is located behind the left side of Lushan Temple. There is a mountain road next to it, which is slightly higher than the top of the temple. It is built of bluestone, and its length and width are each less than two feet. The water drips from the stone crevices in the mountainside and flows into the stone well. It is clear and tasteful. The bay is well-known for dissipating heat.</p>
<p>Here you cannot see the thin green willows along the banks of Shuilu Chau, nor can you see the sails on the Xiangjiang River; two small stalls selling snacks and a few randomly lying carved stones are the usual decorations here.</p>
<p>The spring is named White Crane, and its origin is unknown, but there are two folk legends: one says that when tea is boiled with this spring water, the steam condenses into the shape of a crane, which is white, hence the name White Crane; the other says that when looking down at the bottom of the well, two cranes appear in the well. During the Qing Dynasty, it would be a local product. Once, due to the carelessness of the tribute bearer, the spring water spilled on the way, and the crane disappeared. Nowadays, judged by the eyes of modern scientists, neither has its place to stand. But taking it to explain the origin of the name is not without value, you must know that the origin of many place names in our country is explained by similar legends!</p>
<p>White Crane Spring is so monotonous, and its taste is no more superb than the springs in the countryside, but whether it is new or old friends, once they climb Lushan Mountain, they will pay a visit. Of course, the location is adjacent to the mountain path; its alluring name may be part of the reason?</p>
<h3 id="e238">Spring Frolic in Suzhou City <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Boguang</p>
<p>The huge wheel of time has turned to the season of great spring, and famous scenic spots everywhere have added many footprints of tourists. Of the springs in the south of the Yangtze River, the one that makes people most nostalgic has to be Suzhou, which is like paradise! Although West Lake in Hangzhou is also a good place for tourists to linger, it is not as good as Suzhou with its soft Wu dialect.</p>
<p>Before the autumn wind has been blowing for too long, there are already many women on Guanqian Street wearing tight coats. However, after spring has arrived in the world, the biting spring breeze still relentlessly invades people's muscles and bones, but the women of Suzhou have already changed into spring clothes. If we stare at them, we can see the purple marks of the wind on their jade arms, and the cold shape of their breasts trembling slightly, ah! It really fits the common saying of Suzhou people: "If you want to be charming, freeze to scream." Intoxicating spring! You rely on women to embellish it!</p>
<p>Tiger Hill is the most interesting place, and it is impossible not to enjoy it in Suzhou. The scenery on the mountain is worth lingering on. But when we return to the inn and climb into bed, we think of the scenery of the day: and we hear the nightingales and swallows in the next room, tossing and turning and unable to sleep. At that time, we are about to hum a song; "The colors of spring annoy people and they can't sleep, the moon moves the shadow of the flower onto the railing."</p>
<p>There are many scenic spots in Suzhou, such as Tianping, Lingyan, Tianchi, Huashan Qionglong, Guanyin, etc., which cannot be said all at once, and are very suitable for ordinary ladies and gentlemen to have fun in spring, to enjoy and feast on the spring colors.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Grand Reunion of Classical and Emerging <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<h3 id="e240">Evening Smoke at Linwu Mountain <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>As the boat enters Turtle Mountain Islet, one can see a not-so-high hill; surrounded by mountains, it is the shortest bluestone mountain. There are no large trees on it, and no forests can be found. The mountain is barren and bare, standing abruptly, with rugged rocks and towering cliffs. At the foot of the mountain slope, there are two student stone caves, which are Linwu Caves, and some people call them Dragon Caves. The cave is more than a zhang high, and also a zhang wide, and about three or four zhang deep, but it is not bottomless, because it is gradually deeper and smaller, so there is no way to measure its depth. There are many steles at the entrance of the cave, many of which have been eroded, and the handwriting is also blurred and difficult to distinguish; however, the ancient characters of "Ninth Cave Heaven under Heaven" can still be faintly seen. There are many bats in the cave, and they are not afraid of people, flying all day long between the right holes. There is shallow water under the cave, and the sound of ding-dong is endless. It is said that this cave can lead to Hubei and Hunan. It is only necessary to have a full torch and a salted duck egg to illuminate Hubei and Hunan and eat Hubei and Hunan. In the depths of the cave are dragon beds, stone tables, and exotic treasures; because there were originally two jade dragons entrenched in the cave. This mountain was originally called Linwu Mountain, but because of this legend? Therefore, the villagers only know that it is called Longdong Mountain. On the mountainside facing east, there is also a "Yanggu Cave", which is high, open, and dry. However, there is a Guanyin stone statue at the entrance of the cave. The mountain produces fragrant valley swords, which are shaped like lilac grass, with a clear fragrance and sweetness. Eating too much will cause bleeding in the nostrils. After the plum rain season, a kind of stone fungus will grow on the stone slab. After picking it off and washing away the sand and mud, it can be made into a soup, and its taste is excellent.</p>
<p>After going ashore from Zhenxia Port, walking through a long brick street, and standing on a small bridge, you can see a row of sandy roads, winding from the field to the foot of Linwu Mountain. There is a "Wuai Nunnery" to the south of the mountain, which is said to be the place where Liu Xiangnu attained enlightenment. The incense in the nunnery is also very prosperous, but although this is a nunnery, there are no nuns in it, but only monks.</p>
<p>There is a flower medicine altar in the east courtyard of the nunnery, on which various wonderful flowers and plants that bloom in all seasons are planted. To the south is a row of study rooms, with bright windows and clean desks, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, which are arranged very elegantly. Pushing open the window, you can also overlook the vast Taihu Lake and the dots of sails; especially in the early morning, watching the sunrise, which is as big as a gong, slowly rising from the horizon in the east. In summer, it is even more of a summer resort, because the climate on the mountain is at most only ninety degrees. If you are there in the evening in autumn, you will really have the feeling of "the falling glow and the lonely prosper flying together, and the autumn water sharing the same color with the long sky"!</p>
<p>After passing through a line of sky, we climbed up the mountain peak by grasping vines. Flat as a tabletop, wide as a reed mat, stone slabs are everywhere, and an unfinished stone tower rises up like an old man. There is also a hole on it, as big as a dou, and the depth is bottomless. The villagers burn discarded paper, and all the ashes are poured here.</p>
<p>Standing on a cliff and looking down, we can only see a clear stream at the foot of the mountain, running along the foot of the mountain, all the way to the rice paddies in front.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, and the roofs of the houses in the village were showing wisps of smoke, so the Linwu Mountain was also surrounded by mist. It is really a strange scene; we feel like we are in the depths of white clouds, misty and hazy, and all the surrounding scenery has changed into a blurred posture: "It's so beautiful! It's so great!" We couldn't help but shout like this.</p>

<h3 id="e241">New 6G7 Composite Vacuum Tube <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>— Full-Wave Rectification and Pentode Powerful Output Tube —</p>
<p>Because modern radios require a small and exquisite body as an important condition, it is necessary to think about the problem of reducing the number of vacuum tubes. To reduce the number of vacuum tubes, each vacuum tube must serve several functions. Past vacuum tubes, such as zA76B7 and 55, were produced in response to this need.</p>
<p>Recently, Canadian Radio Corporation has released a new 6G7 vacuum tube, which combines a full-wave rectifier tube and a pentode powerful output tube. It is expected that after the introduction of this vacuum tube, the general small radios will have more significant progress and amazing development! The filament voltage of the 6G7 vacuum tube is 636V. The output power of the pentode part is about I.8W. The base has seven pins. The old name of the tube was 89RS. Recently, in order to meet the standard naming of the Radio Manufactured Association of the United States, it has been renamed.</p>
<p>The attached diagram shows the internal structure and wiring of the 6G7 vacuum tube when in use. H is the common filament, P1 and P2 are the screen poles of the rectifier part, and k1 is the cathode of the part. Usually, the filter circuit in the B electrical appliance is probably connected to the B+ place. Here, in order to reduce the bottom foot of a vacuum tube, it is changed to the B1 end. (If it is connected to B+, the curtain grid of the pentode part cannot be directly connected to K1.) P3, G1SG, K2, etc. are all the corresponding poles of the pentode part. Their function is the same as that of ordinary pentode tubes, which readers already know well, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>After the 6G7 vacuum tube is used together with 6A7, it becomes a wonderful three-lamp superheterodyne radio. In the past, the popular small superheterodyne radios on the market always required at least four lamps to distribute various functions. At this point, the old appearance can be changed and a new look can be given.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Various Uses of Variable Resistors <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Shi</p>
<p>Regarding the various different uses of variable resistors, let me write down the twelve types I know. The one used here is best at 100,000 ohms, because this amount is the most suitable for most of the following experiments. However, in Figures 1, 4, 10, and 11, it is more appropriate to use a 10,000 ohm one.</p>
<p>Figure 1 - The resistor is connected in series in the antenna, or connected between the antenna and the ground wire, so that the excessive broadcasting can be</p>
<p>Figure 2 - The 100,000 or 200,000 ohm resistor is connected in series on the screen grid circuit of the high-frequency or intermediate-frequency amplifier tube, which allows us to use the correct voltage on the screen grid.</p>
<p>Figure 3 - A volume control (100,000 ohms), which is installed on the secondary side of a low-frequency transformer, is also a simple way to reduce excessive broadcasting.</p>
<p>Figure 4 - A method of feedback management in a detector tube, using it to weaken the feedback circuit. (10,000 ohms) The feedback coil is directly facing the secondary coil and fixed inside the machine. The increase or decrease of the feedback force is only obtained from the variable resistor.</p>
<p>Figure 5 - The tone quality converter is connected in series with a fixed capacitor of 0.0003 microfarads and installed on the loudspeaker. When the amount of resistance is reduced, the bass tones will be adjusted well, and the sharp hiss will also be reduced proportionally.</p>
<p>Figure 6 - The resistor (100,000 to 200,000 ohms) is installed on the screen grid of a detector tube, which allows the screen grid to obtain the correct and appropriate voltage.</p>
<p>Figure 7 - Volume control and tone quality conversion use a 100,000 to 200,000 ohm resistor, which is connected to both ends of the grid resistor of the low-frequency amplifier tube. The capacitor connected in series is 0.004 to 0.006 microfarads.</p>
<p>Figure 8 - Volume control connected to the loudspeaker can reduce the power without changing the tone quality. (100,000 ohms).</p>
<p>Figure 9 - The variable resistor (200,000 ohms) is placed in the screen grid circuit to adjust the power of the high-frequency or intermediate-frequency amplifier tube, or the detector tube. The blocking capacitor is one microfarad. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e243">Another Simple Test Method for Good or Bad Magnetic Loudspeakers <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>The loudspeaker is the voice of the radio. If the loudspeaker is not good, no matter how sophisticated the structure of the radio is, the sound must not be good. Therefore, considerable attention must be paid to it when purchasing to avoid mistakenly buying inferior products. Now I will introduce a simple test method as follows:</p>
<p>During the test, connect a resistor in series (if the voltage is 220 volts AC, use a 10,000 ohm resistor; for 110 volts, use a 5,000 ohm resistor. This instruction is not necessarily fixed, and can be slightly increased or decreased at will.) and insert it into the socket of the household power cord. At this time, if the speaker coil is intact, an AC sound of 50 cycles (or 60 or 25 cycles) will be emitted; otherwise, there is a break in the coil. If there is miscellaneous noise in addition to the AC sound, the paper cone must be broken, or the position of the iron sheet (Armature) that vibrates to make sound is improper and should be repaired. If the emitted AC sound is harmonious and not sharp, this loudspeaker will be able to faithfully emit low-frequency sound waves. When listening to Western music, it is very harmonious and pleasant.</p>
<p>Pay close attention during the test to prevent electric shock. There is no danger to the loudspeaker.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Radio in Beiping <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Dian</p>
<p>There is no need to introduce Beiping to readers. It is the area with the highest culture in the whole country and the most developed education, but the latest tool for communication and culture - radio - is too backward in this ancient city. It is neither as popular as in Shanghai, nor does it have a broadcasting station as large as in Nanjing. There are now a total of four formal broadcasting stations in Beiping:</p>
<p>The first one is the earliest established Beiping Radio Broadcasting Station (call sign is XGOP, power is 100 watts, frequency is 952.3 kHz). It broadcasts for about eight hours a day, but almost all of it is used to broadcast theater operas, and because the machinery is outdated, obstacles often occur during broadcasting.</p>
<p>The second one is the British merchant Zengmao Foreign Company's (Marconolo) radio station (call sign is XOMO, power is 118 watts). It also broadcasts for about eight hours a day. This is a Western radio station. Although it has been registered with the Ministry of Transportation, the broadcasting rights still do not belong to us. In addition to broadcasting Western music records every day, it also sometimes broadcasts music from the Beidong Hotel. In addition, it broadcasts two hours of Chinese records and advertisements every day.</p>
<p>The third one is the newly established Hebei Broadcasting Station (call sign is PGOT, power is 500 watts, frequency is 1230 kHz). It broadcasts for ten hours a day, and the programs are better than other radio stations, and the broadcasting results are not bad. In Jiangnan, if you use a radio with better selectivity, you can also receive its broadcasts.</p>
<p>The fourth one is the Yuying Middle School Radio Station (call sign is XHPA, power is 30 watts, frequency is 1194 kHz). This is an amateur radio station. The broadcasting time is not fixed, and the programs only include records, music, and celebrity speeches. It is not often broadcast now.</p>

<p>Kangmao Radio Company, located at 47 Ningbo Road in this city, has always managed famous American radios, such as Yuais, Eagle King, Feige, Aikai, etc. The company's repair department used to only repair radios of its own company. Now it is heard that the company will expand the repair department in response to the needs of all sectors of society, and purchase the latest instruments to serve all sectors of society. In order to facilitate all sectors of society, the repair department will be moved to Daqinglikou, Nanjing Road for business, which is truly good news for those who have radios.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Resolving Age-Old Feuds in the Ash of Cigars <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Paris on the 17th stated that diplomats from France and Germany may soon be able to resolve age-old feuds over cigars and ashes at the conference table. I think that if age-old feuds can be resolved over cigars and ashes, then Chen Gongbo's ashes can really govern the country and bring peace to the world.</p>
<p>Although the Council of the League of Nations passed the resolutions of France, Britain, and Italy, it still could not solve the difficult problems in Europe caused by Germany's rearmament, because the paper tiger of the League of Nations had long been seen through, and the result was worthless. Now, to control Germany's rearmament and stage another performance of "Heroes' Meeting," no matter how many cigars and ashes are consumed, I am afraid that the more they consume, the more they will feel smoggy and still unable to solve the German problem.</p>
<p>Any organization or group, if only a few people manipulate it in the middle, will absolutely not be able to take care of the interests and well-being of all members. This is a common problem in collective organizations, and the League of Nations is no exception. Therefore, at this conference, with the first cigar ash, Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov (because the Soviet representative spoke first) dropped a bomb, what is called advocating the reprimand of unilateral abandonment of treaty obligations should be applied to other continents, the same as in Europe, etc. When this bomb was dropped, even though British Foreign Minister Simon immediately asked Litvinov to withdraw his reservation, and Frenchmen Laval and Aloisi also resigned for it, although this bomb did not explode in the end, it had already frightened the committee members pale. Cigar ashes sometimes cannot only fail to resolve old feuds, but can sometimes increase old feuds, which is also unpredictable.</p>
<p>Moreover, before the Council of the League of Nations passed the resolutions of the three countries, Germany had issued a warning, saying that if the countries of the world adopt the resolutions of the Stresa Conference, Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party will never return to the League of Nations, and the German government will take an independent attitude, that is, Germany has been discriminated against by other countries and must have greater military power. This warning was issued by the spokesperson of German leader Hitler, and it cannot be compared to the words of ordinary irresponsible people. Looking at it from this point of view, the ashes of cigars may not have the effect of resolving age-old feuds, but may instead add fuel to the fire and increase the retaliatory nature of age-old feuds.</p>
<p>In short, facts speak louder than words. Since the many cigar ashes in the past could not solve the current difficulties, how can we expect the current cigar ashes to have unexpected effects? This is something that everyone can see, and the tearing up of treaties in the past, in addition to tearing up treaties, also forcibly occupied other people's land with violence. The tearing up of treaties now is just rearming for self-defense. How can we say that a country is not allowed to build up its military and defend its territory? If we compare the two, which reason is sufficient? It can be decided without saying a word, and the League of Nations can only pretend to be deaf and dumb and not act as a matchmaker. No wonder today there are many cigar ashes in the League of Nations meeting, which are equal to the cigar ashes in a wine shop, only for temporary talking and laughing, and will soon pass by like lightning. Where is the effect?</p>
<h3 id="e247">Literacy Education Movement <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Er Lang</p>
<p>Reports say that Shanghai will mobilize the entire city to implement compulsory literacy education starting on July 1st. This is something that deserves attention. According to the mayor's report, three-fifths of Shanghai's 3.5 million people live in the urban area, and two-fifths live in the concessions; three-fifths of those living in the urban area, about 2 million people, are estimated to have 500,000 illiterate people (these 500,000 people are from 13 to 50 years old). In other words, among the 2 million people in the urban area, there are 500,000 illiterate adults, and the Education Bureau estimates that there are 150,000 school-age children from 6 to 13 years old who are out of school. The total number of illiterate people is 650,000! This is really an alarming number!</p>
<p>Now, to implement compulsory literacy education, the urban area of ​​Shanghai will be divided into 22 districts, with 10 schools in each district, 6 classes in each school, and each class divided into adult and child classes, with a quota of 50 people. Classes are held three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening. The first phase will graduate in one month, teaching them to recognize 600 characters in the middle of February, and be able to understand and use them. In addition to setting up schools, a literacy education service team is also organized, with principals, teachers, and staff of primary and secondary schools in the city and older students as the organizational center. All civil servants and party members also join this team. People in the team go to people's homes or go out to find illiterate people to teach them. Then, literacy education mutual aid groups are organized in families, factories, or shops. Literate people in each unit organize a mutual aid group. All illiterate people in the unit who cannot go to school are helped to teach them, so that illiterate people who cannot go to school also have the opportunity to become literate, and those who are not literate at the end of the period will be punished! This kind of plan is very thorough, and it will not be difficult to eradicate illiteracy in Shanghai from now on.</p>
<p>However, the human instinct is to be eager to learn. Just look at how children always ask adults again and again when they encounter things they don't understand, and you can know this. However, may I ask, are the 650,000 illiterate people in Shanghai willing to be aware of the words? They were born to be rejected from the school gates by life for the sake of living. Now that they want to become literate, how can they not be happy, but they have to work all day long to eat, where can they find the time to allow them to become literate? When implementing compulsory literacy education in the future, I think it is best to do this: for illiterate people who do not have a fixed job, give them wages in proportion to their work every day and ask them to concentrate on becoming literate; and for illiterate people in factories and shops, order the factories and shops to allow them to stop work for two hours every day to become literate (wages are not deducted). This is the only way.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The End of Two Months <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>—Mountain Residence Notes—</p>
<p>Coming here to the mountains was during the winter solstice; although it was the season of falling leaves, it was infinitely exciting to come from a city where there was nothing. Those bald mountain trees, the quiet clear streams, I sent two months of time quickly, and now it is spring!</p>
<p>Holding my younger brother's hand, I stepped out of my friend's house and glanced at this secluded hut for the last time, and I couldn't help but feel hurt. This is a warm and cozy room, a resting place for the withered soul of a wanderer. After a short gathering of two months, now it is a wandering in the north and south again! From my friend's house directly to the small road of the river pier, the mountains and forests around me were blown by the spring breeze, that is, a few unknown migratory birds, now it is goodbye, but when will we meet again? I slowly walked forward, staggering like a camel, wanting to say goodbye to them for the last time, but it seemed that the way ahead was obscured by fog, and I could only hear the beating of my own heart. This is the morning after a new rain has cleared, and there is no sound of footsteps on the mud road that is like velvet.</p>
<p>The seven-year-old younger brother also lowered his head and walked slowly. Was his weak heart also hurt by the separation? If there was no accidental opportunity this time, we would never have known each other. Accidental gatherings and inevitable departures, we cannot be so emotional. That is just a seven-year-old child, it is too cruel to make him hold on to perhaps indelible images! When we came to the stream where our journey was blocked by the small river on a snowy day, I pointed to the green pine and asked him: "Whose tomb is that?" Obviously it was casual.</p>
<p>He raised his head, met my gaze, and a pair of black and large little eyeballs rotated so innocently, "I asked grandma, it is the ancestral tomb of a former high-ranking official." He jumped lively onto the blue stone where we had rested last time, and made a gesture of looking forward.</p>
<p>"Uncle Shanghai, I can't see it. Grandma said there is a very, very big tomb inside."</p>
<p>I also jumped onto that blue stone, and peered through the dense pine forest, but it was just a collapsed earth mound. "The descendants of the former high-ranking official's family are probably declining, right? The weeds on the ancestral tomb are already so tall." Thinking in my heart, I lied to the child:</p>
<p>"Yes, it's very, very big!" I laughed deliberately, "That day we sat here thinking it was the end of the road, but we didn't know there were still many, many beautiful sights ahead."</p>
<p>"My grandma doesn't like me to come out, Uncle Shanghai." He tilted his head and thought, "When I went home that day, I told grandma that we had finished walking the mountain road, and I didn't know if there were any fun places outside. Grandma asked me where I went that day, I said there was a small river in front, and the right hand side was a very large forest - grandma listened and laughed for a long time, and told me that it was the ancestral tomb of a high-ranking official's family, and in the past there was half a mountain this big -.</p>
<p>While talking and talking, I almost forgot to catch the first small steamship. I should be so grateful to my friend for his hospitality during these two months in this scenic spot! Even if you stand here for another ten or eight years, you will have to leave one day. "This is not your home!" That oppression that seemed to kill people, I hugged him down from the green stone and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go, the small steamship has already called out! Next time I come here, I will bring a photo to make it even more interesting."</p>
<p>The child heard that he would bring a photo and clapped his hands and said, "Dad always said he would take me to Shanghai to take pictures. That thing must be fun, taking pictures that look like real people." He thought for a long time, hesitatingly, "Uncle Shanghai, tell Dad to take me to Shanghai, Shanghai is fun!"</p>
<p>I patted his head gently, "I told your dad, I'll come to the mountain to pick you up, okay?"</p>
<p>"Then, come in the summer," he called out as if he had allowed him to go to Shanghai, "Let's go to the back of the mountain to play, there are many, many beautiful flowers, called - grandma said it."</p>
<p>He scratched his head and smiled at me, expressing his apology.</p>
<p>The river pier was already in sight, and the small steamship called out a second time, so I took his hand and hurried forward.</p>
<h3 id="e249">The Wind of Lingnan <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>This year's spring is still so bleak, and when the cold wind blows over, it falls into the depressed chest, carrying an infinite meaning of tenderness, making people slightly wrinkle the ripples of a stagnant heart. After all, it is the spring wind! I murmured to myself with a bit of amazement.</p>
<p>Such a spring wind, blowing on my heart like this, cannot help but stir up endless sorrow!</p>
<p>It was the scenery of many years ago, I don't remember clearly. However, the spring wind of Lingnan, that taste, is still floating in my confused memory, floating... floating my heart so sour! The spring wind of Lingnan that makes people miss!</p>
<p>An innocent, pure white jade-like child's heart, leaping in the gentle and beautiful spring wind of Lingnan, is always joyful, happy, and there is no trace of the gray walls of the clear and beautiful scenery, people's hearts! However, these things have disappeared like smoke and dreams so silently and completely. The childhood heart, the Lingnan wind of childhood, may never be found again! This is even more unbearable! After the happy year-end of the old year passed, and the spring procession was just over, the spring breeze was warm; the green mountains, the green waters, the gentle and beautiful scenery matched the peaceful and secluded countryside. Children playing and jumping were scattered everywhere, countless happy toys! People worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, and they were so loving and kind. They happily sowed seeds and transplanted seedlings full of hope. Soon the green and vigorous rice fields echoed the gentle shouts of the farmers and their wives. The trees were near the mountains and rivers, secluded and quiet, the streams flowed slowly, the birds chirped softly, the warm wind drifted slowly, and the green water rippled with beautiful and gentle waves; the bamboo forest rustled and played; the hard-working couples stopped to greet them, and the wind blew comfortably; the pedestrians fluttered their clothes and walked leisurely; the children watched the dancing willow leaves and jumped happily. How intoxicating is the gentle wind blowing through all this secluded and beautiful scenery!……</p>
<p>However, remembering these old scenes, I am even more sadly hearing the incessant, wailing from Lingnan... That distant Lingnan, the wind that is floating, is no longer the gentle and light spring wind! But the crying, bloody wind, blowing alone through the desolate and broken wasteland!</p>
<p>Crossing the towering mountains and ridges, like a deep, bottomless wasteland and forest, after drilling through the ten thousand peaks, you can reach the hometown of Lingnan inside the Phoenix Mountain. Gazing at the rustling bamboo forest of Chen's Garden on the side, countless pink and white high houses are listed on the hillside, and the ancient and majestic North Mountain Palace stands out beautifully, and the pine trees in front of the palace are lush and facing the water, as if they are right in front of me! However, now, the North Mountain Palace has been burned, the pine trees have withered, there are few bamboo forests left in Chen's Garden, and the pink and white high houses have become scattered, dilapidated, ruined walls, and mixed with tiles and soil. There is no smoke from the cooking, and no longer can the sounds of chickens and dogs be heard. In the spring fields, there is no green rice, no herders, no jumping children, and no loving and mutual response sounds. The spring wind sweeps across the mountains and rivers that seem to have died, only carrying a strong smell of blood! The wind of Lingnan has completely changed!……</p>
<p>"Who doesn't say that our Phoenix is ​​a paradise, but we have been disturbed by several wars, and then bandits have looted us many times. Farmers can't make a living, and they have to encounter disasters... It's over, it's over, the countryside is scattered and people are dead," the spring wind of Lingnan has become a bloody wind!</p>

<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Quietly stepping onto the road back home, I thought like this in my heart, thinking;</p>
<p>The home of a wanderer, you are too far away from me!</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years... I have been wandering like this, wandering; in a foreign land, at the crossroads; I have never missed that distant hometown before, let alone thought about the home I left more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for exactly eleven years. In these long eleven years, I have only wandered in a few cities; although my mother often writes like this:</p>
<p>"Yun, you have been away from home for more than ten years. You should come back for a visit and see your elderly grandmother; your sisters and brothers also miss you very much..."</p>
<p>Yes! I should have gone back for a visit long ago; to see what the hometown is like after more than ten years, and my grandmother and mother must be older than before, right? My sisters and brothers will also be surprised when they see me, a young man in his twenties, has become so haggard!</p>
<p>My home is in Jiangnan, which is a famous water town. It is surrounded by water, and our home is on a isolated island that stands tall in the raging waves. There is no road to pass through here, and there are only civilian boats on the waterway. Therefore, my unwillingness to go back in the past was also largely related to my fear of taking civilian boats. Now I heard that there are small steamboats running, which has made me, a traveler who has been wandering outside for more than ten years, rekindle the thought of homesickness.</p>
<p>(Go for a visit! After all, the hometown is lovely, and the old home is also worth missing. What's more, there is also my grandmother and mother who miss me; my sisters and brothers are also looking forward to the return of this wanderer!)</p>
<p>No, how should I go back now? Is the wanderer who has been wandering for more than ten years just going back like this? I should bring some success that the elders expect to comfort them! But there is nothing, nothing! Only a body of a man in his twenties that has been worn out by life, and a face that is so old and thin that it looks like a man in his thirties—isn't it too disappointing for them to go back like this? But what can be done!</p>
<p>Speaking of my own son, I also feel ashamed! After struggling in the city for more than ten years, not only did I not achieve anything, but I only ended up with cold treatment and contemptuous looks. I want to cry when I think of these things, but because my tear glands have long been dry, I finally didn't cry:—when a person wants to cry heartily, but can't cry, that is really more difficult than anything.</p>
<p>The wandering life of more than ten years has given me only endless loneliness, emptiness, sadness and pain; only the bitter tears have been my sympathizers and comforters, but my tears have also been shed in these long years, and now I don't even have this only comfort.</p>
<p>"I am uneasy when I whip my horse to return home. I have never stopped thinking about the darkness of the future. I endure the wind and dew and keep going, just because the hair of my old parents is white." The first time I stepped on the ship heading towards my hometown; on the way back, I poked my head out of the window and looked at the shadow of the hometown mountain gradually approaching in front of me. I couldn't help but feel that "the scenery is still the same, but people are no longer the same!" Then I opened a page of diary and silently wrote the above four sentences:</p>
<p>("The home of a wanderer, you are too far away from me!")</p>

<h3 id="e255">Charlie Chaplin, the Comedian, Makes a Comeback <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Investing a Million to Film a New Movie, Love Has Matured, Causing a Sensation Throughout the City</p>
<p>The news of Charlie Chaplin, the comedian, has not appeared on the front pages of newspapers for at least three or four years. In these three or four years, we have only occasionally heard news that he will be filming a new movie, but it was not very certain.</p>
<p>After this, we occasionally received news that Chaplin was going to film a new movie, and people paid special attention. Even more, they wanted to know if the new movie was a silent film or a talkie. However, this news soon faded away. At the same time, some people said that after Chaplin returned to the United States, he would make a movie on his own, but in the end, the new movie did not appear before us. Recently, there has been a rumor about Chaplin's family life, saying that he and Paulette Goddard are deeply in love and will soon be married, and that they will co-star in a movie. However, this movie has not yet started, and we have let this piece of news pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>Because the news about Chaplin is very mysterious and unpredictable, many journalists have recently visited him at his home. As a result, people know that he will start filming a new movie soon. The female lead is, of course, Paulette Goddard. If the general public's judgment is correct, then she must be the future Mrs. Chaplin. Because when a reporter went to visit, Chaplin was not at home, so Goddard received him. In short, anyone can see that although she has not married Chaplin, she is now taking care of some of Chaplin's household affairs. Undoubtedly, she will soon be Mrs. Chaplin.</p>
<p>According to Chaplin himself, they will soon co-star in a new movie, which is titled "The Mass". The filming time will be about five months, but it probably will not be released in Los Angeles before August of this year. We recall that Chaplin's first movie took four and a half years to film! Chaplin's new movie, "The Mass," is intended to be greater in every way than any of his previous movies. He personally intends to invest one million US dollars in this new movie, but we can recall that when he made "City Lights," it cost five million dollars! He naturally believes that this huge investment can be recouped after the new movie is released.</p>
<p>Chaplin's new movie will reportedly not have dialogue but will have sound effects. However, Chaplin himself will not say a single word in the movie. The story depicts a typical worker in a high-pressure American factory. Chaplin is a craftsman who assembles screws and is hired in the factory to specialize in assembling screws on the transmission. As the story unfolds, Chaplin is suspended from his job for committing a fault and is even falsely accused of being a Communist leader and imprisoned. From the above, we can see that Chaplin's new movie: (1) depicts the innocent suffering of a worker, and (2) satirizes modern industry. According to Chaplin, the movie does not contain the slightest political element, and he is very confident that it will be welcomed by South African barbarians, Siamese, British, or people from other countries, but the Soviet Union is not included.</p>
<p>Finally, we will discuss the love story between Chaplin and Miss Goddard. This miss is very similar in appearance to Chaplin's early lover, Ieta Boone Elkins. Although Chaplin himself denies that he will marry Goddard, anyone close to Chaplin believes that they will get married immediately after the new movie is finished. Goddard is often at Chaplin's house, and every weekend she is often with Chaplin's two children, Charles Spencer Jr. and Sydney Earl. These two children are currently receiving military training at a military school during their free time. Here, it is not without clues that Chaplin and Paulette Goddard are deeply in love and will soon be married!</p>

<h3 id="e256">Review of "After Office Hours" <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>From the perspective of material selection, scriptwriting, and performance, "After Office Hours" is not much different from "The Easiest Way," which was recently starred by the same male lead, Clark Gable. Although its content is empty, the scriptwriting skills are clear, elegant, and exquisite. These are quite suitable for leading actors such as Clark Gable, the so-called screen heartthrobs. This may be the advantage of this type of movie.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about the scriptwriting method. Here, the producers and directors simply used more than 20 scenes to perform a fairly wrong plot and exert a not very shallow acting skills. The love between Sharon Norwood, a socialite, and James Brach, an editor of a certain newspaper, is the warp, and the murder case formed by the love triangle between Tommy, Sharon, and rich businessman Mr. Baterson is the woof. The progress is quite in line with the three-act stage play. The introduction is from the newspaper editor's acquaintance with the female reporter and the three photos of the photographer to the separation of the five people with ulterior motives in the Dongjiang Water Nightclub. From Sharon's throwing herself into Tommy's arms to the unfolding of the murder case, this section is the development and also the twists and turns from James and the photographer's re-investigation of Tommy's residence to Sharon's wavering towards Tommy is the climax. If it ended here, the whole play would not feel like it was missing anything. However, the author ended with a happy ending, which is an old cliché.</p>
<p>This kind of drama may be very beautiful. Then, art, including movies, naturally does a considerable job of beautifying life. It's just that it is still a bit regrettable that, in addition to beautification, it also unintentionally exposes a bit of the face of New York society. For example, the ambiguity between the wife of a rich businessman and the legal advisor cannot be resolved. When the advisor falls in love with a beautiful young girl, he does not hesitate to use murder. The fact that the editor of the yellow newspaper, the photographer, and others do not hesitate to risk their lives to obtain such news to increase newspaper sales is also revealed in sweet kisses and passionate love.</p>
<p>Following the exquisite scriptwriting, the director achieved great results: simple, clean, clear, fast, and powerful. It's just that it has not yet gotten rid of many unnecessary things, such as the maid's slapping people, the awkward posture during the boxing fight, etc., which, in addition to low-level fun to make people laugh, have no meaning related to the content. As for the long section of the chase in the wilderness, it is simply redundant. The modification and description of the characters are also not perfect. In the nightclub, when James and Sharon are busy talking about love, a pair of noble guests come to say hello, which increases the psychological expression of the two and also explains Sharon's identity as a socialite, which is still acceptable. The fact that James fought Tommy twice, losing the first three times and winning the last three times, inevitably blurred his personality.</p>
<p>In terms of acting skills, Clark, in addition to his earnestness and considerable activity, does not seem to be better than in his past movies. The female lead, Constance Bennett, is inevitably disappointing. She has almost become a self-less expression, just lengthening the background of others.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Review of "Adorable" <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhaoren</p>
<p>Xin Guang</p>
<p>Regarding "Adorable," we cannot help but say a few words about the leading actress, Janet Gaynor. Chinese audiences are really too familiar with her, and she made people shed a lot of tears in movies such as "Seventh Heaven," "Angel," and "Street Angel." Therefore, her demeanor has left a deep impression on people. Almost old ladies who don't often watch movies can recognize that it is Janet Gaynor. People are really too familiar with her. Therefore, the opening of "Adorable" at Xin Guang can just illustrate that movie merchants know the audience's psychology well; watching Janet Gaynor is the same as watching Hu Die in "Twin Sisters" or "Rebirth Flower."</p>
<p>In Frank Borzage's "Seventh Heaven" or "Angel," Janet Gaynor is a pure-hearted woman who has won great sympathy for her miserable life as a poor daughter. Similarly, in "Street Angel," she still appeared before the audience in the same posture. However, after "First Year Honeymoon," she broke up with Charles Farrell, who was considered a screen couple, and she also began to appear in a relaxed posture. Of course, this is closely related to the trend of relaxation throughout American movies. Everyone wants to be relaxed and cheerful, and Janet Gaynor is, of course, no exception. She can no longer earn people's tears with sadness, nor can she amuse people with so-called lively sweetness.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, she has gradually become estranged from Chinese audiences. Until now, "Adorable" is only three or four movies. At the same time, she no longer shocks people as she did before. Almost all of them are ordinary and cannot give people a deeper impression. People sigh that Janet Gaynor has fallen from grace.</p>
<p>Now let's look at "Adorable". First of all, the story is fictional, which does not arouse people's interest. Would you believe it? In Central Europe, there is a kingdom that cannot be found on the map. There, a notary suddenly falls in love with a lower-ranking lieutenant and then arbitrarily promotes him. … It is very clear that it is a nonsensical absurdity without any truth. Just like that, the playwright thought that it was not funny enough, not enough drama conflicts, so he brought in a prince from a neighboring country to form a love triangle, making many princes and ministers make many jokes. Under these kinds of jokes, we can only patiently listen to the jokes, but we cannot get any other meaning.</p>
<p>The most brilliant scene is the appearance of the emperor. The playwright and director used exaggerated methods to make the audience guess that the emperor must be a remarkable and powerful figure. However, the final appearance was a seven- or eight-year-old puppet emperor. Therefore, the audience laughed loudly. This climax of laughter, as the end of the play, is not a brilliant scene, but people cannot recognize its deep satirical meaning.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we cannot but say that director Wilhelm Dieterle's technique is skillful. Whether it is in the mood, the picture, or the sound, he has excellently grasped the relaxed fun. In particular, the dance scenes are quite gorgeous, which adds a golden coat to this empty story. However, we cannot see Janet Gaynor's superb acting skills here. She, like the male lead Henry Garat, is just doing her job plainly. This proves that she is not very suitable for appearing in this kind of light comedy.</p>

<h3 id="e259">The Little Minister (5) <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The Scots are originally passionate people. They feel that Babbie is more important to Lady Carmichael than she is to herself. She is completely different from the ordinary Gypsy woman. They can't help but admire her in their hearts. Lady Carmichael is already busy coming down to ask what's going on. At the same time, the door opened. A person rushed in, his face pale, and said, "When the minister arrived at the church, many people had not yet dispersed. Peter had locked the door and would not allow it to be opened for the minister to enter. Li Dao held a knife and wanted him to open the door, but Peter finally refused. When he stabbed Peter, the minister shielded him with his body. So he was seriously injured. They are about to carry him here. Has no one gone to call a doctor?" Immediately, more than ten people said, "Go and call a doctor quickly!" Soon, Carmichael was carried back, and his clothes were covered in blood. He stood at the door and said, "Okay, now you're all here. You can convict me of anything." When he saw Babbie, he continued, "I was with her when I should have been at the church tonight. You probably want to say I'm a criminal, but none of you know. She is the one I chose. If you think she is worthless, then I am just as worthless. We are in love. God has blessed me:?" He closed his eyes as he said this, but continued, "...God has blessed me and made her belong to me, and no one can separate us."</p>
<p>He almost fell after he finished speaking. Thomas helped him to bed. Lady Carmichael cried and said, "Poor my son. God won't let you be unhappy." He slowly replied, "Don't cry. Have you seen Babbie?" "Oh, she is so lovely, and we are already good friends." At that time, Babbie leaned down to comfort him, saying that it was all her fault. She comforted him, saying, "Darling, when shall we get married?" He looked at her and smiled, answering, "I hope tomorrow." "Then let's get married when you're better. Then Mr. Thomas and Mr. Spence will be our witnesses, right?" She said, looking at those two elders with her eyes imploringly. Thomas was still hesitating. After Spence pushed him with his hand, they both agreed at the same time.</p>
<p>The doctor came, and everyone left except for a few elders who were still in the room, and Babbie was still with Carmichael. Babbie leaned against the door, looking up and clasping her hands, desperately praying to God. Those elders were all looking at her, and her faith had moved them. After one night, Carmichael was no longer in danger. Then Lord Rildore came to visit Carmichael in person. Of course, Babbie knew as soon as she opened the door that this was his excuse. She told him the whole situation from beginning to end. After he heard it, he said, "Do you love him that much? Don't you have any pity for me?" She replied gently, "Although you are not happy now, you will forget soon. You don't love me at all." "You want good food and good living, everything is luxurious. There is none of that here. Can you endure it? I can buy you anything in the world. Isn't that loving you?" "You don't understand what love is. He cherishes me like this in everything, so I want to cherish him in the same way." Rildore said, "Babbie, I really don't understand you. You have completely changed."</p>
<p>At that time, Lady Carmichael came out and said, "Babbie, he wants to see you." Babbie said goodbye and continued to ask the Duke, "Really, even I don't understand myself. But isn't love created by God? So, if a woman falls in love with someone, God will definitely help her." Lady Carmichael continued, "When we have love, God protects us. Babbie, go in, but don't be too long. He is still weak. He needs your strength. May God bless you." (The End)</p>
