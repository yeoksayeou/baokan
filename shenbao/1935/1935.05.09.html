<h3 id="c21">第二十次國恥紀念 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>旗懸半程。宴樂全停。國人今日。又悽然以紀念被迫承認二十一條之國恥矣。自民國四年之此臼。袁世凱於強國使臣「惟諾與否」之威逼下。造成此國恥紀念。以時間言。已歷二十年。以程度言。則國家之恥辱愈增。一若年年紀念。效力毫無。悲憤沉痛。徒資發洩老。嗚呼。其然。豈其然乎。</p>
<p>吾人深信。國恥紀念日之年年來臨。不啻一高嗚之警鐘按時向國人發共警吿。國人有委靡之習。此警鐘之聲至少可使之奮發。國人有麻木之病。此警鐘之聲至少可使之振作。此外如人心之渙散。民族自信力之缺乏。在此警鐘高嗚之下。均得有矯正之可能。二十年前之今日。日本送達最後覺書之消」電傳至滬。本報時評中甘言日。「所謂覺書覺書者。中國屢屢受之。共亦因此而有覺悟否耶。如其覺悟也。則誠日本之賜。」今日之所以重視國恥紀念之效用。意亦猶是。特望此警鈸之效更爲宏大。國人之聞此鐘聲而奮發振作。及有所矯正者。弗限於鐘鳴之短時期耳。有人以爲「中國人國恥愈多。志氣愈薄。國恥愈深。志氣愈弱。」此偏於一面之觀察之言也。當此國恥紀念來臨之日。凡有血氣者受此刺戟。未有不感今後責任之重大者。是卽其所以督勵國人。激其志氣也。</p>
<p>嗚呼。朱爾典「埋頭十年。或可與日本抬頭相見」之語。在二十年後之今日。徙作回憶之資料。袁世凱「十年以後。中國之危險更甚於今日」之恐懼。竟成今日之事實。如使羅輯上因果之律尚有可據。則以前種種。皆當歸咎於所以紀念國恥者尚未恪盡其紀念之責任。深得其紀念之方法。今者第二十次之警鐘嗚聲。已示吾人以努力奮發不可更緩。急起圖強不容濡遲矣。時乎不再。國人其注意焉。</p>

<p>中國以農立國、挽救之圖、仍祇有從農產入手、照前述情形、凡救濟農村、扶助生產之要義、就銀行立塲說、當以金融上種種便利方法、培養其萌芽、扶植具長成、使生產之品、各自得其出路、析言之、即一面增長其生產力量、一面引導與消費接近、减少中問種種隔閡、本行負有發展實業使命、自當認定此項着力基點、以爲業務上進行準則、試將本行今後努力之方針、略舉其要、</p>

<h3 id="c181">暹邏敎育部長　對取締華校強詞狡辯 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>藉口華校越法取消強迫班　華僑各代表意見未予接受</p>
<p>暹邏政府頒布苛律限制華僑敎育事件、巳引起朝野憤慨、正在紛紛籌謀對謀辦法、本市華僑聯合會昨接旅暹僑胞來電報吿、該國敎育部長柏　沙拉巴攀氏曾於日前召集暹京華僑各校代表及報界、對頒布之華僑敎育苛例、强詞狡辯、茲特分誌如次、</p>
<p>發表荒謬之聲明書</p>
<p>是日暹邏敎育部長柏訕沙拉巴攀氏偕同次長曁秘書乃威叨出見各代表、首由該部長發言、略謂今天請諸位到此、乃爲關於向大衆解釋取消强迫班事性、倘用口頭叙述、則恐有言之不詳及容易漏忘之弊、故今天印發解釋聲明、此次敎育部之所以取消强迫班之原因、詞畢特將荒謬之聲明書分發各代表、（聲明書從略）常各代表將聲明書閱完後、該部長發言謂關於此次收回强迫班之一切理山及答案、俱載聲明書內科諸君閱畢當能明瞭、（衆未啓口）該部長繼謂倘諸君對於聲明書記述、如未明白、則可自山發詞、於是各代表提出質問如下、</p>
<p>藉口越法收回華校</p>
<p>（一）玫瑰學校代表天主敎神父首先發問、華校辦理旣無錯誤、且未犯任何條例、教部何以令其停辦收回、（按玫瑰與校係天主敎所辦、專敎信仰該敎之華僑子弟）、該敎長答（以下簡用答字）並非爲錯誤與否之問題、敎部爲遵照憲法所規定之敎育主旨、欲促其實現、乃有着令停辦之舉、（二）廣肇代表問鈞長謂華人在暹與辦敎育、其裨益於暹國者甚鉅、且華校爲邋敎部代肩重任、至今爲時已久、今敎部决將自行肩負此重任、教部此舉、對華校實有功成、見棄之嫌、此鈞長之意乎、答當然已預備淸楚、（三）暹邏新聞報代表乃儂問、（按乃儂係暹人、廣肇學校校長、同情於華人者）、依照憲法、則人民吿有享受初等敎育之權利、故任華校自行辦理、能代敎部効勞、而所得結果、豈不相同、現敎部要收回自己辦理、以余之見、似可無須、答因華校均未能照辦、故應收回、乃儂再問、不遵照條例的學校、敎部可行封閉、但因一部份越法而全數收回、可謂公平乎、答不如此、則華校私自越法、何能知之、</p>
<p>失業人數勢必激增</p>
<p>乃儂再問敎部可派員管理否、答若如辦理、則教部必須增多三倍之職、以便分配各校敎室而行管理、此尙未合乎道理也、乃儂再問、以余見之、照原有之職員、已足用、無須再行增加、至於辦理成績如何、可在年終將各華校學生會考、倘辦理未有相當成結者、敎部亦可令其停辦、答諸君所提問者、多係事實問題、此種問題、經於聲明書內答復詳卷、至於敎育部將各華校强迫停辦而收回强迫班、緣敎部照各華校所負責敎育之見童、共有（一）未達强迫年齡、與（二）超過强迫年齡、（三）在强迫年齡內三種之多所負責任、太爲煩重、且敎部收回强迫班、亦僅將在强迫年齡內之學生收歸强迫學校而已、比他未達强追敎育年齡內之學生、及已超過敎育年齡者、尙希各華校能爲本部代勞、代表冉問、倘如是、則不久華校、將多數歸於停閉、大部份之職員、將行失業、失業人數必增、約部細思及此舉、乃與民黨之大政綱相抵觸　、答否、敎部所施行、係根據憲法而來者、當不致與憲法抵觸也云、</p>
<p>他國學校并不取締</p>
<p>暹報代表再問、國籍問題、爲華人誤解强迫敎育之憲結、因中暹兩國之國籍法、根本有互於抵觸之處蓋中國國籍、係指無論生長何地、其國籍皆以生父之國籍爲根據、而暹國國籍法、則認爲凡在暹境生長者皆爲暹邏國民、故敎部對於此點、應有所聲明、使華僑能明瞭其子弟已屬暹人、而應受暹國之敎育及其他之要務與權利、答對於國籍問題、非本部所能致答之範圍、亦非教部之責任、倘諸君願知其詳、可向內務部詢問、華僑代表問、此次其他外國學校、也曾令取消乎、答時機若到、當絡繹取消、該代表復問此際而井時機乎、但爲使事待其平、應一律加以取消、答若是余須有四手四而、方能同時做到、此時只有手一面、故惟其易舉者行之、各代表至此、以暹敎部强詞飾非、毫無誠意接受各代表之意見、遂興辭退川、聞已擬具書而駁復矣、</p>

<p>現在一般人知道蔬菜多含維太命，因此喜歡素食的人很多，可是仔細查查海關貿易冊，只是日本一國每年進口的蔬菜果品，要一千四五百萬元，再到飮食店菜館裏去看看，所用的蔬菜水果，大部分是舶來品，這樣情形，農村安得不破產？，財富安得不枯涸？吾前天和許多老友到漕河涇王君志莘經營的滬西農塲去吃飯，覺得八十餘畝農田所種的，有花菜，有番茄，有蘆笋，有捲心菜，有香菜，有豌豆蠶豆。有果品，應有盡有，吾想這是農村的富源所在，一般菜館居戶爲什麽不買國產蔬菜果食，反去用舶來品？也許還沒有知道嗎？可是像滬西農塲的還很多，都是愁在沒有用路。任士剛君呌我發表出來，介紹於愛用國貨的同志。</p>

<h3 id="c227">五九與提倡國貨 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天是五九國恥紀念日，換一句話說：「是中華民國第一次受到帝國主義者施以最毒辣的國恥紀念日。我們回想到在二十年前的今天，不禁發生了無窮的感想與憤慨！這種心理，我想凡是我們中華民國的同胞，恐怕都是人同此心，心同此理吧！</p>
<p>但是，怎樣能够澈底的昭雪這個奇恥大辱的國恥紀念呢？有人說：「必須全國上下，一致的努力，一致的力謀對外的方法，一致的力求本位的發展，本位的向上，才有辦法。」有人說：「必須整頓軍備，向侵略我們的帝國主義，準備决戰，才能打開出路，才能從死裏逃生。」這許多論調，我們固然不能說牠沒有意義，沒有價値。然而就我的淺薄的見解看來，提倡國貨，實在也是有效的一個雪恥的方法，這話怎樣講呢？請一聽我道來。</p>
<p>我們知道，中國所以不能和列强對立的原因，一言以蔽之，便是因爲國貧民窮的綠故。爲什麽會弄到國貧民窮的地步呢？澈底的講起來，國人之不愛用國貨，專門喜歡用外貨，以致於把雪白的銀圓，滾滾外流，每年幾萬萬幾萬萬的輸出，實在是一個莫大的致命傷。自民元以來，我們假如把每年入超的數字，以及白銀出口的數字細細的統計一下，其數目一定是十二分的駭人聽聞的！試問：一個國家，受外貨的入超，侵略，竟達到如此境地，那能不淪於國貧民窮的地步呢？所以，我深切的覺得，提倡國貨，實在是雪恥的有效方法之一。</p>
<p>因此，我很希望，在今天舉國紀念五九國恥的時候，大家立下一個决心來，不論農工商學兵的任何一界，大家都立下一個服用國貨的信念，自今而後，不論吃的，穿的，住的，以至於任何物品，凡有國貨可用的，絕對的不購買外貨，如果全國同胞，大家都有這麽一個觀念，一個决心，我可以說：不出五年，中華民國的失業問題，一定可以解决，所謂國貧民窮的中國，二十年來蒙着很大的國恥，也自然能雪掉了。</p>
<p>願全國親愛的同胞們，大家趕快起來努力吧！抓住這個五九國恥紀念日的機會，來向這條救國的國貨之路上進行吧！</p>

<p>— 洪福楣</p>
<p>上海市商會以中國工業因毫無統制而造成生產過剩。因生產過剩而致互相傾軋。因互相傾札而同歸於盡。以是工業衰頹。不足以抵抗外貨。故特呈行政院請辦工業統制。以謀挽救。事關全國工業前途。吾人當詳加檢討焉。夫以外人認爲傾銷尾閭之中國。工業絕端幼稚之中國。而言生產過剩。恐非事實。彰彰明甚。旣無統計。又乏調查。而惶惶然以生產過剩爲杞憂。似覺不安。</p>
<p>國貨所以不能與外貨相爭衡者。以技術，管理，組織，設備，機械，等落後於人。國內工業亦以上述各項問題之不同。而異其成本。成本有高低。售價亦因之有上下。工業競爭於是起由競爭之結果。工業本身方能力謀改進。减輕成本。革新技術於是國人乃得廉價物品以使用。抵抗外貨於無形矣。且優勝劣敗。天演公例。故統制工業。以免避生產過剩。似尙非現代中國之所宜。恐利未見而害先發。徒予外貨以長驅之機會耳。</p>
<p>愚見挽救工業衰頹之急切要圖。莫如左列數端。</p>
<p>（一）政府應確切保障國內工業。並處處予以便利。</p>
<p>（二）增加進口稅。防止外貨傾銷。</p>
<p>（三）减免國內不生產之原料進口稅。</p>
<p>（四）裁撤轉口稅及出口稅。並各項苛捐雜稅。</p>
<p>（五）獎勵出口。凡工業品出口。政府應將其原料所完納稅餉退還之。或予以特別津貼。使之踴躍從事。以謀對外發展。</p>
<p>（六）由政府調查產銷。及進出口情形。隨時公佈。使全國工業有所適從。</p>
<p>（七）政府從速施行貿易統制及匯兌管理。以求出入相抵。而限化無益金錢之外流。以穩定國家財政。使國內工業發展更易。</p>
<p>（八）由政府設立研究改進機關。隨時指導全國工業界。以謀技術，管理，等種種改良。</p>
<p>（九）由各業自設貨品檢查處。查騐貨品有無缺點。然後發售。嚴防粗製濫造。碍及國貨信譽。</p>
<p>（十）獎勵國人服用國貨。管見所及。拉雜書之。聊備關心國內工業者商榷云耳。</p>

<p>— 甘純權</p>
<p>洪達藝花廠，廠址在上海閘北姚家石橋，發行所在法租界貝勒路康悌路三零四號，由胡融達君主持工稈，吳警世君主持營業，論其營業種類，專製藝花，一名貼花，按藝花原係歐美發明，嗣經日人仿製，運售中國，其大部份之傾銷地，係江西省各磁器店，用作磁器上之山水花草人物，他如我國各地所用縫紉機，無綫電機，留聲機，網球拍，自由車以及噴漆之器具不易用印刷機印上商標或其他彩色套版者，均可用藝花貼上，鮮艷奪目，旣不易剝落，又不易假冒，故皆樂用。</p>
<p>該廠工程師胡君融達，鑒於我國每年漏巵至鉅，悉心研究，而最初顏色之深淺，配合未能均勻合度，所用金線亦未能十分鮮艷，嗣經數年之實地經騐，始告成功，可與外貨相埒，現上海保暖自來壺上之金字商標，卽爲該廠出品。</p>
<p>該廠之組織，因値初創，極爲簡單，分（一）營業（二）製紙（三）落石（四）機器四部，除營業部專司發行接洽等事宜與本文無甚關係不述外，此外（一）製紙部設化學室，專配各種藥品，化成麵糊之水質，塗在紙上，又設風乾室，使其風乾，成爲藥水紙（二）落石部設書圖室及落石室，係將接受各界來樣，照樣描成，落在石上（三）機器部，由落石部交到已做好之印石架，放上機器，將藥水白紙印上各種顏色，成爲藝花紙，轉印於各種器具。康元製罐廠亦有藝花之製造，當另文詳之。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>整萬兒郞齊舉手　保家保國保蒼生</p>
<p>在上月十八日午後三時，市政府面前的廣塲上，舉起了一萬多隻右手；衆口一聲的念着　用國貨的誓言。悲壯熱烈，得未曾有。這便是上海全市的大中小男女學生派定代表，舉行服用國貨宣誓典禮。</p>
<p>由這一萬多學生肯認眞勸導自己的家人和戚友，由萬而億，由億而兆，眞不是一件難事情。不過我希望這天宣誓的學生，不要把宣誓認爲一件通常禮節。誓宣過了，事體便完結了，儘可以大購洋貨，把國貨視如敝蓰，這豈不是多此一舉的嗎？</p>
<p>古人因爲迷信神權，所以把誓言看得很重要，一語旣出，憑着皇天，后十·山·川·日·月作證，終生不敢淪變。所以曹沫刼齊桓，毛遂刼楚王，都要他歃血爲盟，纔肯放手；而這操生死之權的霸主人君，也决不敢違背盟誓，致招神怒。歷史上類此的事很多，不能一一枚舉。現在的人總明了，知道皇天·后土·山·水·日·月之神，實不來管這些閑事；便是人人敬拜的城隍和觀音，他們也只知享受香火血食，全不理會這牙疼咒語，嘴裏儘管說得好聽，實際却完全相反。所以我希望這天宣誓的學生，要眞的照誓言做去。我們並不迷信神權，我們也並不以爲違背了誓言「天降之罰」。不過進誓言是表示我們的「堅决」和勇往。這「堅决」和「勇往」，並不是空口說說便算了事的，須要眞實地做去才對。</p>
<p>「五分鐘熟度」。「健忘」敵人常常把這些言語譏笑吾們。不錯！我們從前確實犯這毛病。不過從今天起；更從號稱智識階級的學生起，把這惡習慣革除。能說能做，旣然宣誓服用國貨，便認眞地自己起來服用，還勸吿別人服用。</p>

<p>— （巴玲）</p>
<p>悲壯的五月，巳經臨頭了！我們不知道咱們中國的同胞，對于這個悲壯而凄慘的五月的到來，發生什麽戚想？我想：凡是有血氣有志氣的同胞，不致於不無動於中吧？</p>
<p>「雪恥，「雪恥，」不是口頭上喊，筆頭上寫，所能收效的。最最要緊的，還是在全國上下，一致的奮發起來，各求本位之向上，本位之發展，共同一致的服用國貨，才能迷漸的收到良效。</p>
<p>五月，大家認爲是一個「不祥之月，」有的人甚至說它是一個「毒月，」然而，在我看來，五月大可以稱它一聲「奮鬥之月，」只要大家看到五月中國恥之多，而奮發起來，立志要替國家民族，做些事業，五月不是一個「奮鬥之月」嗎？如果在五月中，遇到國恥紀念日，還是和平常一般的渾渾噩噩的過去，那末，五月眞是一個「毒月，」五月眞是一個「不祥之月」了！</p>
<h3 id="c236">偷酒妙術 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>這裏說的「酒」，是指「紹興酒」紹酒運銷各處，必借重過塘行。我們試閉眼一想，一隻大船上載著數百罎酒，什麽京莊，本色，花雕等都有，要不要使酒鬼垂涎？一輩船家，遂發明出二種偸酒妙術來：</p>
<p>一種偸酒的方法較爲簡單，卽，用一根長鐵管，業準酒罎，封泥當中一戳，以嘴吸取之；或將罎橫置，使酒漏出不過這法有時也要失敗，因爲有些罎口上，並小用箬葉等裏封，而蓋上一隻碟子的。這，就使偸酒者無所施其技了。今春我曾開過兩罎酒，一罎口止有隻碟子。當時我猶不知這碟作何用，現在方知這是爲偸酒而設的</p>
<p>還有一種方法是靠著一種秘藥。把這藥敷在酒罎的外面，約如杯口大；再說到小一些，或者像一塊洋錢這樣大。據說，約隔吸了兩根香烟的時候，敷藥處罎質已鬆，起有無數砂眼，而酒自會沁出了。待得酒已偸够，他們再把棗泥輕輕一塗，那罎又變天衣無縫；如非把罎秤過，是誰也看不出它已經出了毛病的。</p>
<p>行行本來有弊端，固不但運酒爲然。况偸酒究不失爲雅事，似可不必深責。不過爲防弊計，我到要勸勸一輩愛酒的朋友。倘使你們要託紹興酒家或者友人運酒，最好起運時，在過塘行內先過一過磅，看有多重，載朋運單；那末，可以保證萬無一失的了。</p>

<p>—參觀倫敦預展以後</p>
<p>上海通裏有位「心眞」先生，做了一首洋涇浜竹枝詞，有說：「者番運出西洋云去，回來人定刮目看。」辭雖俚俗，但言外之意，可想。</p>
<p>眞的，這非想像所及，幾千年累積存下的　寳，會得橫渡大西洋。這是中國門戶開放以後的一伴大事，也是中國文化史値得大書的一件大事。</p>
<p>可是在參觀，這盛大的藝術品預展以後，我又不禁想起作爲中國雕刻品的一個範疇—龜和師之頃的占物。</p>
<p>獅的形態，是代表雄壯，威武。現在，無論鄉村城市，在那舊式的所謂「金粉世界」的門前，總還可以看見一對石頭雕成的獅子，踞坐在石鼓上。要是在北平，那更好，還可以看到銅刻的。那樣子是更爲偉麗。看到這些柬西，會使人嘆賞當時藝術手叚的可驚，而詫異於世人這樣卑視着古代的文化的。</p>
<p>至於龜，在古代人的眼光中，許是一種帶有神秘意味的靈物，有時拿來，象徵壽康」和「吉祥」的意義的。古有「龜下」，有呌「龜年」，有「神龜」，等等。所以，在北平，那宮殿式的房屋外面，往往有「銅龜」這類的東西擺列着。看那姿態，也是那麽昻然似的，毫無可鄙的形狀。</p>
<p>古代的文化，原是靜止的。龜，天賦一付渾厚的儀容，不失爲落落大方，所以，還可登諸廟堂之上，雖然民間直的覺，是把它看做低賤的動物。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說，龜和獅，在廟堂藝術的觀戚中，是占有相當地位。然而，這一類品物，却只有雕刻，而無繪畫，頗又不解。</p>

<p>當程志前和周有容，談到了西北師資的時侯，王北海這小伙子，却是在旁邊深深的歎了一口氣。周有容笑道：沒有報吿之前，這小兄弟倒先歎了一口氣，這裏，自然有一種難堪之處，就請你慢慢的說罷。王北海道：我沒有說之先，要請兩位先生明瞭的，就是西北這地方，本來吃飯也有問題，那裏還談到敎育經費。所以敎員待遇微薄，那並不是那一方面要負的責任。志前笑道：你這孩子，將來可以當新聞記者。爲了免着得罪人起見，先來上這樣一個帽子。那麽，帽子有了，你就說罷。北海笑了一笑道：我們談到是小學，就說小說敎員罷。當然在交通便利，或者地，富足的所在，學校裏面，自然有校長，有級任，敎員也都凖備得相當充足。但是這在全省，是極少數的成分，除此以外，那就無所不有了。普通小學敎員的薪金，總在三十塊錢以上。可是西北地方，有那很窮的幾縣，小學敎員的一年，也掙不了三十塊錢。我那位親戚，原先在一個外縣小學裏，每月掙八塊錢，後來經費不够，凉减到每月六塊錢。因爲那縣城，交通還是相當的便利，這六塊錢一個月的敎員，鑽營的，還是非常的多。結果，我那親戚飯碗不穩，自己見機而作，向校長吿辭，由甲縣調到了乙縣。（二〇〇）</p>

<p>如今且說當日太后聽到了黑寳玉已生下小狗的消息之後，便立卽欣然說道：</p>
<p>「等一會待我們下了早朝，我們必須先到那狗房裏去走一遭，瞧瞧那四頭新產的小狗」。</p>
<p>無論什麽事情，不管它大到怎樣，或小到那樣，只要太后對它發生了興趣，想認眞去做它的話，便永遠是可以實現的！所以我想就是不幸在這一天的早朝上，那些大臣們有什麽關係國家興亡的大事奏上來，伊必然也不會注意；除非說京城外巳到了什麽外國軍隊軍立，立刻就要打進宮來，這樣伊也許還會注意注意，否則是决不能把伊全神貫注在那四頭新產的小狗上的注意力，移轉過來的。說實話，我那時候的心上，也完全給許多的狗影包圍住了，只望早朝快些完畢，好趕快去探訪那一座御犬廐。因爲在這一日之前，我雖然已進宮了多時了，但太后的狗房，却還不曾去過一次。我那時已養成了一種習慣，就是每天渴望着能够隨侍太后，上各處未曾涉足的新地方去看看；尤其深中下懷的是太后每帶我上一處新地方去，必然有許多很有趣的話說給我聽，使我感覺到非常滿意。</p>

<p>— 放庵</p>
<p>立夏爲二十四節氣之一，每在廢歷四月之間。塘棲習俗，例有秤人，燒野米飯之類，且必於立夏前數日往馬鞍由曹大將軍廟，爲小兒祈免瘡痍，此種事關風土之舉，容待考據，茲姑勿贅。惟所謂三燒五臘九時新者，因特記之如次，亦立夏之小食譜也。</p>
<p>三燒爲燒酒燒鵝燒餅。燒酒乃土製者，非以高粱釀成，而以糟製，故曰糟燒，又名本燒，性烈味香，數十年前，凡醬園中必自製，頃亦漸以製自江北之麥燒代之矣。立夏飲之，謂夏令常有薰蒸之氣，觸穢陽腑，用以解之也。燒鵝則選肥嫩之鵝製成，味香可口，燒餅則各處皆有，不復述矣。</p>
<p>五臘者爲臘魚臘肉臘腸臘鴨灰蛋，各以鑒漬成，魚肉等則待其乾而蒸食之，灰蛋則以泥滲鹽滷，封納甕中，過相當時日，即可煮熟而食。凡此數種，皆各家自製，製於冬日，故曰臘，然亦有未必製於冬日者，臘肉且有經夕卽成者，按丹鉛總錄云云·臘之爲言夕也，經夕而成也，意即此耳。鹽魚肉等味，尙香。亦如火腿風肉之爲夏令妙品之例也。灰蛋亦曰鹹蛋，醃臘店雖有出售，然不及自製之佳，凡鷄鴨之卵，均可製。惟鴨卵較佳，佳者蛋黃作火紅色，有如蟹膏，設以陳醋拌之，味亦如蟹。</p>
<p>九時新之名，沿襲至今，今人已不能盡道其祥，據余所知，則爲枇杷靑梅櫻桃烏菱蠶荳黃魚大蒜蝦餅土園笋等等，雖未闕如，然亦不能盡謂即是前人所定之九時新也。枇杷故塘棲名產，有白沙紅沙兩種，而以楊墩種爲最佳，近年產銷甚旺，無遠勿屆。味勝嶺南荔校，然立夏之時，未必枝頭黃綻也。靑梅亦土產之一，邇來冠生　之陳皮梅，亦取給於是。立夏之時正當綠葉成蔭子滿校也。櫻桃粒粒若紅豆子，堪稱席上珍，烏菱則沼中老菱，應時而已，實乏美味。蠶荳維時正肥。新鮮採摘，無論炒之蒸之，翠綠可愛，其色不變，香糯可口，園蔬之上品也。黃魚此間又名石首魚，昔以海帕稽延，僅夏日始克應市，故列時珍，茲則四時皆有矣。大蒜斯時正及令，脆而嫩，佐餐之外，並具解黴功效。蝦餅以蝦和　粉以油熬製如餅故云，亦稱蝦球，塘棲素爲水鄕，魚蝦之屬，所產者特富，籠蝦者不下千百人，價亦甚廉，初出水時，活潑潑地，不論如何烹製，皆鮮　絕倫，不僅蝦餅爲佳也。惟蝦餅製成時，但剪其鬚，留其甲殼，故鬆脆異常，誠下酒之佳肴耳。土園笋異於毛笋，又別於春笋，蓋產於農家園中者，此時亦正應市也。</p>
<p>立夏盤餐，又有所謂合景者，以蝦餅及燒肝（以猪油包猪肝人油鍋沸成，）酥腸（用肉　包以腐皮熬製，）灰蛋，火腿、白肚等合置一盂，亦夏令佳饌，嗜飮者尤喜食之。然過塘棲三十里外，耶無此餚　矣。惟言　狀，則似全家福耳。</p>

<p>— 周劭</p>
<p>江寄萍君在自由談發表「論詩」一文，讀后頗有和自己意見相同的地方；寄萍君是袁枚的愛好者，我亦極推崇隨園，尤是喜歡他的詩話，有淸一代，著詩話的雖極多，著名的如拱稚存的「北江詩話」，趙翼的「甌北時話」，若提倡「性靈」，摒去「格調」，推崇「風趣」，唯有「隨園詩話」無愧色。</p>
<p>「隨園詩話」最大的好處，便是下筆揮灑如是，他從不以爲寫詩話，便一本正經的寫關於詩的話。所以詩話內說人情，講笑話，管閑事，都可以見得，令人讀來覺得並不嚴肅，如記王漁洋一段云：</p>
<p>漁洋先生爲司冠時，夙過慈仁寺。主價某，名動公卿間，漁洋頗厭薄之。一日，價向其歎忙，蓋以其常受王公貴戚之邀以自炫也。漁洋不答良久，始作莊語曰：「何不出家？」（手邊無書，大意如此。）</p>
<p>這是絕好幽默材料，與詩話無關，若他人則必在摒棄之列；他却隨手記下，然而我們讀來，從不覺其多事。</p>
<p>其實詩話之可貴便是此等處，若一味斤以批評詩句爲事，則枯澀得尙有何滋味？且詩與文從不可一列批評，文以實境道實爲貴；詩則在性靈，在神韻，在曲，不在格調，更不在字句之推敲。西崖云：「詩話作而詩亡。」這話也確實，然只對一般而已，非眞的不可有詩話也。張繼詩云：「楓落烏啼霜滿天，江火漁船對愁眠；姑蘇城外寒山寺，夜半鐘聲到客船。」欵陽修謂夜半並無鐘聲，另一詩話作者方辯夜半有鐘聲。這等事與「詩」有何干係來？皮光業句云；「行人折柳和輕絮，飛燕舍泥帶落花。」裴光約謂：「柳當有絮，燕或無泥。」（漁隱叢話）另有一人駁杜　，「濁醪誰造汝？一醉散千愁」曰：「酒是杜康所造，而杜甫不知，安得謂之詩人者？」作詩話而至此，眞如西崖所云：「詩話作而詩亡」矣！</p>
<p>詩人亦有愛管閑事者，隨園詩話謂越沒要緊的事愈佳，所謂吹皺一池春水，干卿底事也。楊鐵崖味柳花云：「飛入畫樓花幾點，不知楊柳在誰家？」陳德榮七紗詩：「請問半郞與織女，是誰先過鵲橋來？」這等處極有風趣：但是蔣苕生却大不爲然，他作牛郞織女辯，力言無是人且無是事。豈不令人可笑。憶苕生持其文示隨國時，隨園只報以「殺風景」三字，這種批評態度是極好的，以之作詩話，便令人讀得下去。</p>
<p>有淸詩人，我最推崇兩人王漁洋與袁子才，漁洋張「神韻」，子才主「性靈」，原是同道人，而兩人最長處，乃能泯除詩人之惡習，一生不次韻，不集句，不聯句，不疊韻，不和古人韻。此五者都是詩人的大病，能泯除是不容易的。更進一步最好能不用典，這恐怕漁洋和子才也做不到吧！</p>

<p>— 枕石</p>
<p>皎月掛在淸徹的天空，竹林樹葉間簌簌的吹來了秋天的寒風，浸透了人們的心情冰冷。我穿了單薄的羅衫，我手裏拿着母親給我的幾塊月餅。在夜深人靜的時候，我凄凉的在急速的走，走，老年父母嘆息着的姿態，恍惚間追隨在我的心頭不去，祗覺得凄凉，迷惘，悶塞着的空虛。那天晚上就祇有你在伴送着我。我們並肩走着，默默的，默默的，彼此都不作聲。但是我們是以沉默共語，萬語千言，敎我們從何說起呢？且讓斷續的犬吠聲點綴着秋虫的合奏。夜的蒼茫，悉人的明月，人影在地，路上的沙土，在我們的脚底下擦着切切的聲音。雖然那夜依然有田野間的淸香，可是那對於當時的我們一乃是完全失去詩意的了。</p>
<p>我們走着，默默的走着，一直到北門城外的飛星橋頭，我們是非分手不可了，我站住了緊緊的握着你的手，我用力迸出來的聲音說：</p>
<p>「二弟！我是不知道什麼時候可以再回到我們的家鄉的。……你今後打算怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>你當時半響沒有作聲，你的眼光緊緊的望着我，隨後你啞着嗓子說：</p>
<p>「我不能說定怎樣？不過我一定要出門去，這個家我待不下去。」……</p>
<p>從那一晚起，我開始漂泊。因着生活的折磨，我連家信也不願多寫，而你不會知道我的旅視何處。我們是四年來不通書訊了。一九三一年秋，從故　來客的口中，知道你的一些淸息，這使我有着說不出的歡喜，同時也有着說不出的慚愧。可是爲時不久，你死去了，母親也死去了。對於你的死我怎能哭泣呢？我只有憤恨來安慰你的英靈！熱了我的心靈。爲了人類的眞愛與和平，爲了惡　們的仇讐的報服，我憤恨着，面對着這世問醜惡的一切。</p>

<p>— 風子</p>
<p>昇曙夢批評安特列夫說：「把過去二十年間安特列夫的作品一看，除出極少數外，是都觸著社會問題的。」又說：「撇開社會而想理解安特列夫，和撇開火而講究烟一樣。」</p>
<p>這話非常確切。</p>
<p>雖然安特列夫曾經用悲觀消極的眼光估計過一切，然而他的作品大都不曾離開社會，却是磨不去的事實。這樣一個通俗文學家——如果他必得被目爲通俗文學家的話——其作品的不爲一般人所理解，乃是必然的事。</p>
<p>一切聯繫著社會問題的現實的描寫，至一般人看來，是無甚趣味的。</p>
<p>他們完全爲尋開心而看小說，而弄文學，所以注意點就集中在趣味上。他們的趣味是：才子佳人的悲歡離合，達官貴眷的奇行怪癖，生著三只脚的孩子，活到二百六十歲的和尙，鶯花老六的一笑，歌舞皇后的大腿，鼻孔裏吐出一道白光，追著殺人的俠客，以及怪誕的血案，離奇的風俗等等，這些都使他們覺得有趣，好玩。</p>
<p>此所以野人記要出到十本，而柯南道爾也終於能够擁有廣火的讀衆。</p>
<p>不過倘把上述這種趣味移植到比較嚴正的所謂純文學裏來，那結果，我看是不會好的，會使讀者無心去找尋文章的正意。如果抽去了毒質呢，那就也抽去了一般人們的趣味。</p>
<p>剩下的仍舊只有不能得到廣大讀衆的純文學。</p>
<p>所以，比較嚴正的所謂純文學裏也需要多多地加入趣味去，這是千準萬確，毫無問題的。然而要抽去毒質，而仍舊保留著趣味，卻是一件困難的工作，至少在我們這個社會裏是如此的。</p>
<p>我們要讀者能够欣賞純文學，懂得眞正的趣味，必須把他們從有毒的低趣味裏解放出來。四月二十日。</p>
<h3 id="c247">街 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 希雋</p>
<p>摩天的高曆立體建築，接連地豎立在兩　，是街的骨骼，街的動脈管，却是一串串的電車的行列，汽車的行列，以及人流的行列，而這些交織物景就組成街的複雜的內容了。容載在街的身上的東西，多分是騷亂的，除了無生命的屋子以及旁的靜物之外。街留在你記憶上的是無理的呌囂和粗雜的混合奏響的凝集，印象，街的畫面是不恊調而醜劣的，小痊三和呌化子是街的累贅的寄生蟲，像人身上的爛瘡疤，可是怎麽也去不掉，而且儘是到處滋生着。</p>
<p>紳士們絡着高貴的女人的胳臂打街上走，忽然掠半邊兒伸出隻汚　的手求施捨，鼻涕眼淚攪不淸的拖滿一臉，跟上去鳴呀地叫裏　着。這不能不認爲是雅緻的街最大的缺憾，然而更大的缺憾還有着哩！入夜的街，在嘹曉的强烈的燈光里邊，在人們的刺刺的眼簾底，一羣一羣的臉孔潻着濃厚胭脂，滿身噴着香味的專出賣自家的肉體過日子的俏娘兒們儘笑嘻嘻地排列到街上來了。蛺蝶似的在人業穿梭的，投擲着誘或的笑，邪妄的眼珠，向着水流的人們兜　着。</p>
<p>這更是麗的衝的大黑埤了。街的確是太綢惡的。人們也將以爲這些無恥的人家把街弄得奧濁不堪了，然而那街的另一面的高洋房子上邊，蠕動在爵士樂的音律里的同是身子等於商品一樣，拍賣的女人却覺得可以陶醉與接近，而樂得糜費金子去換取摟抱的關係。是的，街就在這樣矛盾的當中生存着，隨着一天天的繁華起來，新的高大建築物無限量地產生，新的缺憾亦同時繼續擴張，站在街上做賣笑生涯的人越來越多了。</p>
<p>因爲街上所有的東西是五相消長着。有的生產，有的自然要耗費。先前的街熱閙的，現在也還是熱鬧的，只是平添好些玩藝兕，空中老是飄着無數的終年大减價的大幅布廣吿，街上的店子每日里有關門的字條貼出來，這種事，以後的街是很少見的，如今倒成了最奪目的街的點綴物。</p>
<p>街原是靜的，不變的，可是容載在街的身上的東西，却漸漸地變，有些是增加，有些反消滅了。</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>「新加拉惹」傍着阿沙漢的碼頭了。在海關里，爲子二本帶來在旅途上消遣的漢文小說，給關員糾纏個不淸。虧得林君精通馬來話，向關員釋明這是爲旅行的消遣用的：「這是「玩玩」的，沒有什麽意思。」並且我們是從荷屬的鄰近口岸轉來，並非新從別國入口的。結果才被允許放行。</p>
<p>「荷屬地在施政上，因爲地勢和歷史的關係，是不十分統一的。」林君在我們離開海關後，便對我說：『所以便是在旅程上帶書籍，也是麻煩而帶有危險性的。』他遼加着說：</p>
<p>『總以不帶爲最好。』</p>
<p>我唯唯無語。對於東方人的殖民地子民，我能够說什麽呢？</p>
<p>進了旅館，冲過凉之後，我們便到附近的一家海南人的飯館去進晚餐。</p>
<p>飯館里人雖不多，却是異常喧噪。尤其是鄰桌的二位中國老僑，月着馬來來讞談國內的形勢的，更是震耳欲聾。他們似乎完全不會講中國話，（這是經過我一番考察而證明了的。）却是對於國事異常關心。看他們兩方爭論勝負，把白色的口沫都掛在嘴角，甚至幾至動武的，便可知道。我知道，自從國民革命以來，僑界間是很受着一番激動的。看本來是巳經馬來化了的華僑，也都關心國事，令人對民族的前途抱着很大的奢望。可是，此後，國事除用馬來話來爭辯勝負人外，更有什麼人引起與趣的呢？</p>
<p>飯後林君陪我巡行於阿沙漢的街道上。對於曾經引起華，巫糾紛的「巴塞（市塲），更引起我的注意。這里的「巴塞」，有一種特徵的，便是充滿了馬來人：和別處的差不多由中國人完全獨佔的，存着很大的差異。</p>
<p>「這里的馬來人是很猖獗的，」林君吿訴我：「前些時，爲了爭「巴塞」上的販賣權，曾引起了馬來人排華的鬥毆。後來，荷蘭政府於暗地黑對這事加以煽動和彼勵之後，却用武力制止了。至今阿沙漢的「巴塞」，中國人總算讓步了。試想，假使處處的馬來人都這樣頑强，不要說中國人要吃虧，便是白種人的治理也恐怕不容易吧！」</p>
<p>我默默地聽着，不曾說什麼話。心想中國人底「夾板」式的地位，是可憐和可恥的。同是一樣被壓迫的中國人和馬來人，爲什麽不會和協地聯合在一起呢？爲什麽反要互相鬥毆呢？這不正是帝國主義所希望的麽？</p>
<p>「自從經過了那次的風潮之後，」林君又機續說下去。『中國人便把「巴塞」的販賣權退讓了。而殖民政府，看見這種被煽動的排華風潮，是會轉變爲搖動着自己的統治權的，便用武力和調解的方式把道事件抑制下去。現在，中國人對這里的馬來人是有準備的，而這里的馬來人，也比別地方土人底團結力來得高强。所以馬來人的排華，是有再度被煽動的可能的。</p>
<p>我急切地問：</p>
<p>「那麼，自從那次以後，風潮可曾再爆發過麽？」（未完）</p>

<p>雨脚還沒有住，東北風吹來，全是一股濕氣，看天色一時還不能放晴。黃忠樸提着兩隻沉重的雨鞋，走在泥濘的路上，身子搖擺不定的，常常有倒下去的份兒。可是那濕漉漉的泥地上面，隱約地映着有發那可憐的臉，好像在哀求着他：黃先生，你可憐可憐我吧，求你去跟陸大爺商量一下，請他發點慈悲，那筆欵子就借一借，龍會的錢只有三天期咧。那時候他黃忠樸一定要在鼻子裏哼了一聲，放點顏色給他們看，敎他們認識認識他黃忠樸的厲害，這村子裏在陸大爺跟前最有面子的，除了他便沒有第二個人。他還得敎訓有發一番，那不識利害的有才要管敎管敎，年紀輕輕不要那麽全身是一副倔强的骨頭，回頭吃了虧不上算的。這時候有發的可憐樣子一定很惹人好笑。他故意要說只有三天事情怕不好辦，陸大爺的錢，也不是現成放在家裏的。一直說到後來，他才好容易答應了辦這樁事，不過要有才的老婆立刻進陸府做奶媽。</p>
<p>他得意地走着泥濘的路，想想心裏就發出笑來。剛走過二尺來寬的板橋，便看見有才跟胡永良他們幾倘人，正站在豆腐店那邊，胡永良嘴裏正咕暇着什麽話。有。那個高觀骨長方的臉子，叫他看了心上就給什麽擊了一下地，猛的一抖。有發那可憐的影子也不知溜到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>「黃先生，怎麼你的牙齒掉了一個呢，可是給陸大爺……」胡永良身傍的一個小伙子，說到這裏便笑了起來。</p>
<p>有才也淸脆地笑了一下。</p>
<p>黃忠樸連忙把舌尖舐了舐上排牙齒間的一個空缺。十來隻眼睛都釘住着他，他來不及在鼻子裏哼着他們一聲，怕拖住似的，匆匆地走了過去。</p>
<p>你們這些小子不要那麼放　，看你們有好結果的！有才你這猴子不要，還有三天，三天……</p>
<p>黃忠樸在肚子裏這麽咕農着他斷定這些小子沒有好結果，將來要給縣裏當土匪重辦的。他的步子加快起來，他到他保那邊去，一定叫地保催緊點，只有這三天，一天也不能放鬆他們的。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c250">取締迎神賽會 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>跟着時輪金剛法會而風起雲湧於我國社會民間的，是各地方次第舉行的迎神賽會。遠的不必說，最近浦東迎神於前，江灣賽會於後。此倡彼和，全市若狂，熱鬧之至。頃聞閘北居民不甘落後，亦在醞釀。只要經費有着，當局不禁，盛事當不减於浦東江灣。</p>
<p>然事極不幸，前日江灣舉行迎神賽會，却意外發生了一件救火會員焚毀神像事件。救火會員此舉，意在破除迷信，而快人心。但這事已引起了當地人士的憤慨。商民己呈請市商會主持公道，並停付江灣救火會補助金。市民方面，亦以神像被毀，深示痛心，羣相臂纏黑紗，以表哀悼。並要求焚毀神像者，照前裝修，以平衆憤。中國一般無知人民迷信之深，可見一斑。</p>
<p>查迎神賽會，旣屬迷信之舉，又極勞民傷財，事實無益而有損。只因我國民自來迷信甚深，又緣於腐舊的風習，故時有這種愚傎舉動發生。而當局者爲順從人民心理起見，亦並不加以制止，因是此風至今不絕，甚且愈益變本加厲。</p>
<p>近者市黨部鹽於本市各地方迎神賽會之舉，非常盛行，不但有干例禁，而於社會治安，亦不無妨害。且以上海爲中外觀瞻所擊，文化倡導之源，風聲所播，全國是從。際此新生活運動積極進行之時，而又有這迎神賽會之舉，恐爲外人疑我所謂新生活運動者，大抵如此，故特函請市府迅行佈吿，並嚴令公安局負責取締。這對於民族復興上，當不無多少裨益也。羅伽</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>（我是懼怕若命運底權威的哪！）</p>
<p>夢幻似的情緒，我常常如同一隻飄洋船一樣地，浮游在寂寞的人海里，浪費着我底不再歸來的靑春，是那麽毫不用心地。</p>
<p>——飄泊難道是永遠地限制了我底生命底光輝了嗎？</p>
<p>我這樣問，這個問是沒有人來替我做解答的，惟有期待自己底答覆吧！然而，我是永遠不會有一個答覆的，是的，我這隻生命底小卅航駛於險風惡濤的大海里，而我底小舟又缺乏了生活底舵，那末我將如何答覆了自己底問呢？</p>
<p>（我底小室中，你是尋覓不出一本日曆來的，因爲它是最能招致我底太息。）</p>
<p>我是在一個長長的噩夢里，打發我底日子輕易得好像吸完一根紙烟，而且，我更常常被現代底交通利器，搬柬又搬西地移動着，我相信我底行蹤，還不及候烏底遷徙，來得準確啦！然則，我是沒有打主意的。</p>
<p>在一個小小的山城里過了冬天，我隨着春天，到這個繁華的海濱地了，而我是第二次以黃浦江底濁水做飮品的。</p>
<p>命運底指揮刀，驅策着我，走進了貧苦的潭子灣，我是這樣沒有目的地，做了潭子灣底陌生旅客。</p>
<p>（我應該吿訴你：我底住所是一隻小小方匣，東面有一扇小小的窗，是銜破了的洋鉛皮做的，而我這小室底四壁，是原紙板似的本板。角隅里掛滿了塵灰蛛絲。你不必驚奇，我這間小室，在潭子灣是等於一座二十四層的洋樓，從小窗望出去，是櫛比的茅草棚，這些屋子里，棲息着體力勞働者底一家人哪！他們底靈魂是善良的，你是會相信我底話的吧！）</p>
<p>每一個早晨，工廠底汽笛瘋狂似的相互響應。牠們把我底靈魂，從夢中拖回來，於是，我跳下床，開始一天的生活。是這樣地，我畢竟住下了！潭子灣底整個形體，潭子灣底居民底面譜，以及它們底一切生活狀態，對於我是有點太陌生了！</p>
<p>然而，我願意慢慢地熟悉它們，我忍受不住潭子灣所投擲給我底陌生眼光，這是對於我的一種侮辱。</p>
<p>（不是嗎？我僅僅是穿了一伴敝舊的藍布棉袍，踱在小街上歸寓所去，我便看見一羣衣衫襤褸的小孩子，放射着揶揄的眼光，而使我會無端地感覺到，自己是在一個互相不了解的環境里生活着。是啦！潭子灣底人們是鄙棄長衣的，他們相信體力勞働是最偉大的，所以它們是穿着短衣，短衣者羣里，是容不下一個長衣服的人的哪！）</p>
<p>於是，我就謹慎地，拋棄了我底固有的觀念，去觀察潭子灣底靈魂深處，從它底側面像，橫剖面，我應該去了解潭子灣，我相信，假若要潭子灣了解我，復得由我先去了解它。</p>
<p>由此，我漸漸地了解了潭子灣。而潭子灣底陌生旅客的名號，也就成爲我底過去生活底雅謚了！</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>到河埠頭，小汽輪已拉第三回響了。挑行李的僱夫告訴我了艙位，我向小弟弟吿別了上小汽輪。因爲是春天，作客歸來過年的商人，這時候又得離別家鄉了，小小的通艙中擠滿了乘客。我站在船首向小弟弟揮了兩次手，船亦蠕蠕地離岸了：望着我的小侶伴拉了僱夫的手，——他的背形在松林中消逝的時候，才擠進艙中。</p>
<p>這裏二十里的水程，小汽輪每天來往一次，陸行是不通的：然而這小汽輪往往爲了沒有乘客而數天不開行的我到從裏來的時候，是冬天，和現在是同樣地擠滿一艙人，他們懷了終年辛勤所得的代價而在年尾到溫暖的「家」中來聚天倫之樂，和我得了三個月意外的假期到山中來休養，一種快意的喜悅，何嘗不是同樣地呢？</p>
<p>太像一個淪落在異鄉的兒子，一旦歸家來，受着母愛的撫拂，——朋友母親底股動地欵待，及我的小伴侶底陪伴我的寂寞，——一百天的生活，使我血股的創傷在溫馨的暖窩中溶化了。自家是一個沒有家的流浪子，在模糊的記憶中彷彿勾起童年的黃金時代，但是這一些幻想的歡樂每被現實的生活像浪花一般地擊破了，三個月的從居，重使我溫　依稀的暖意；可是，現在，我又將被這小汽輪帶到殘酷的世界去了！於是我盍上了像眼睛，彷彿想驅除一切不快意的襲擊底來臨似的，倦伏在艙面裏，把世界與我隔離。</p>
<p>我默默地聽着，船尼的水聲，被機輪打的嘩啦嘩啦的嚮，有時又似乎不勝其壓迫地怒吼起來；我就不得已睜開眼來巡視這現實的世界：有…下垂着長長白鬚的老者，有掛着哭喪臉的婦人，有應該享受高等敎育的學齡兒童，更有嗎？或許和我同類的無家可歸的人了。這些人都要趕完三十里的水程，再向各方面飛去，「爲什麽呢？」我自問起來一回答我的嘩啦嘩啦的水聲。</p>
<p>可惜我沒有注意來時的同輸乘客，當他們撞了一個快樂之夢飛歸到温暖的窩裏來，或許他們把一切的痛苦拋諸腦後，但是他們早已預期到有這末一個日子請載歸的汽輪送出去，「這又是爲了什麽呢？」快樂與痛苦是相對的，抑是快樂藏在痛苦的背後呢？</p>
<p>船尾的水聲更嚮大起來，我向窗外瞥了一眼，小汽輪已駛入官河。辨方向，是經過孝女寺的，沿岸的景物，依稀故人一般熟識。彷彿自己跳入小划子，和舟子努力泛着將，抵孝女寺的河埠。那反映着燦爛的陽光的，不是孝女寺的紅牆嗎？那一聲聲傳來的鐘聲，不是孝女寺中早課的梵音嗎？雖然當初孝女寺的影像，打破了由居一切幽靜出俗的好感；然而孝女寺中的和尙，他們同是一般無家可歸的人啊，　　　　同是溫暖的窩裏飛出來的，正如　　　輪的旅客一樣。他們裝起了正經面不驅取施主的錢財，這不是罪惡，這是他們求生存的方略，在我們周圍的世界中，更有許多用不正當的手段來剝奪他人生存的權利呢？</p>
<p>望着孝女寺向　舷逝去，我覺得這裏隱藏着一個悽痛的故事呢！我感到這紅牆可愛，我感到這梵音動聽，是的山裏的一切，都是可愛的，然而這拖着嘩啦嘩啦水聲的小汽輪正把長向相反的方向駛去呢。</p>
<h3 id="c254">酒店 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>大銅鑼般大的　蛋黃的太陽，走完了它的旅稈，帶着倦憊的身體，懶洋洋的鑽進西邊的樹膠園背後去了。</p>
<p>大地上的熱氣，已漸漸地消退了。一陣陣的凉風，輕淸淸的，從膠樹的梢頭漏過來，吻着人們的身心，彷彿有如吃過一杯泳洪淋那麽的爽適，凉快，使人們王掉了白天的勞苦與酷熱。</p>
<p>這時，永興頭家挺着凸出的肚皮，站在他的酒店的門口，迎着輕飄飄的晚風，悠閒地，輕鬆地，望着藍天里鱗鱗的紅霞，和歸林的倦烏，等候着從樹膠園里出來的顧客。</p>
<p>永興頭家的酒店，是開設在樹膠園的右邊的，約莫距離樹膠園有十幾步遠的平坡上。店里的規模幷不大，低矮的亞答屋，擺設着十幾隻舊陋的桌子，櫃檯的旁邊高高的陳列一排「白酒」　，櫃檯上擺放着一些廉價的下酒物—如：沙汀魚，魚乾，菜荳，家居雜鹹等。—他的主顧就是那些從樹膠國里出來，滿身淌流着臭汗，臉孔黑油得像炭頭的工人。除此之外，終年是很少瞧見一個過路的陌生的主顧走上他的店里來喝個三五杯的。</p>
<p>當每天太陽收歛了驕炎的熟力，像　蛋黃似的，懶洋洋地掛在膠樹梢頭的時候，永興頭家便泛上得意的微笑，站在他的酒店門口，彷彿在歡迎客人。自然，這時正是樹膠園的工人放工的時候。同時，他的酒店的生意也正跟者　里的工人放工的這個時候，開始地熟鬧起來，有生氣了。</p>
<p>「哈　，坤孟德先生，怎麽好幾天不上小店來喝幾杯呢？近來的「生活」一定很忙吧。……」永興頭家瞧見那全身黑油得像炭頭似的，滿身針刺若花紋的工頭坤孟德跟蹌蹌地跨出國門來，忙衝</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>上前去，拉着他的粗臂膊，打着不純正的「番話」說。「怎麽幾天沒有看見，你就有點兒瘦了，神色眞難看，可不是夜里睡不甜？……嘻嘻！……」</p>
<p>那個呌做坤孟德的，却好像一點也沒有理會，沉着腦袋，心里像裝滿了萬般心事，慢條斯理地跟着永興頭家走進了酒店。</p>
<p>「阿福，給坤孟德先生打半斤「白酒」，來一碟魚乾，……揀新鮮的，大的。」永興頭家吩咐店夥之後，就凑近坤孟德的桌邊，坐下去。「這魚乾今天剛從綱谷運來，又大，又鮮，多適合口胃進坤孟德先生，這回包管你吃得不想走開了。」永興頭家嘻皮笑臉地搭訕着，他知道那個人是最喜歡吃魚乾的。</p>
<p>「呃，……那個人的口里却隨便的嗯着，隨後，就像木偶般的沉默。</p>
<p>「坤孟德先生，今天可不是受了家內人的氣，怎麽這樣不高興呢？」永興頭家是深知道坤孟德是一個極爽快的人，笑話在他的口里，簡直像湄南河里的流水，滔滔地流瀉個不盡哩。但像今天這樣沉默的態度這是永興頭家認識他二十幾年來所不曾見到的。於是，永典頭家的心里也有點不安起來了。</p>
<p>「永興頭家，你的生意恐怕要做不長久了。……」停了一會，坤孟德終於開口了，像很費力似的拉長着嘶啞的嗓音說。「膠園的「座山」已不想做這生意了。……你知道，幾年來樹膠的生意是虧蝕得厲害，把他整千整萬的家產都賠到里面去了。現在「訕頂」又嚴厲地限制樹膠出口，使許多樹膠都賣不出去，滿堆在棧里。可是，最近又要徵收什麼「營業稅」，這眞使「座山」心灰志冷—現在，「座山」已决定在最近的期間內把膠園結束收歇了。……」他斟滿了一杯「白酒」，咕的一聲，恨恨地灌到肚子里去了，隨後又再斟一杯。</p>
<p>永興頭家這時可有點茫然了，他像喝醉了酒似的腦袋沉重得發昏，眼睛老不轉動地釘住着坤孟德的紅眼，一句話也說不出來。他的心坎給煩惱的網緊緊地纏繞着。他想：「膠園收歇之後，這　酒店。——維持一家人的生活的酒店，要遷移到什麽地方去呢？」</p>

<p>— 微茫</p>
<p>落花時節，春是歸去了！</p>
<p>懷着悵惘幻滅之感，孤寂地站在孤獨的桃樹之前。</p>
<p>做着過去的春的夢吧？春是歸去了！</p>
<p>春，是靑春之謎，是人間的夢吧？在春天，這靑春的心兒是不勝其苦惱的。然而春一去，看洛紅是化成汚泥了，靑春的心可又像被戮傷般的哀痛了！</p>
<p>——春，愛的季節；春一去，愛也隨之而去了！</p>
<p>想着往事，會不悽然淚下麽？</p>
<p>輕愁而惱人的落花時節呵！</p>

<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>掠過了帶有着些微酒意的灼熱的臉上底春夜里的輕微的風，在這午夜的路面上吹拂着。刺進千個萬個的毛孔中，就好似是從冷氣箱中吹來的透凉。從口里哼出的帶着濃烈地氣味的熱氣，隨着輕風撲進鼻管里，一陣陣難堪的酒氣，壓得呼吸也都感到窒息的難過。</p>
<p>疲倦迷曚的眼睛微微地睜開着，展現在視綫中的一切，就都好似在跳着快步舞的旋轉，腦袋已經是感到不自如的沉重了。然而，在紊亂的視綫中，雖已消失去了那華貴富麗的大廳，消失去了那燈紅影綠地景象，可是，她，一個蛋圓地，已經是憔悴了的臉，却還在眼簾上忽現忽滅的閃動着。</p>
<p>在二點鐘之前，當着才走進那富麗華貴的大廳，木就發現了她坐在那一列女人的位置上。當木吿訴我之後，我突然地感到了腦袋的緊縮，血流好似受到了槍聲的震刺而急劇地旋轉起來，我不敢注視她，然而她那憔悴的臉，却已深深地印進了我的腦中。已在記憶里將近消逝了的她的幻影，又加强了力量地威脅着我的腦神經，我完全沉入在深思的夢景中了。</p>
<p>是一年之前吧！那是一個初夏的晚上，悶熱的空氣壓迫着呼吸，在深夜里，我突然地驚醒，大地上一切都是沉浸在靜穆的深淵里了，房子里是一片漆黑，從巷角上射來的瓦斯燈的昏黃的光，在那時是顯得格外的明亮。我依在窗前探望着黑夜里的都市的景色，突然地在我的眼前却浮現出了一個少女的面影。她，住在我的窗的對面，那時的她，正是已經很疲倦的從那華貴的大廳歸來的時候。</p>
<p>自從那一夜起，她是引起了我的注意了。我是在極力的想知道她的身世和名字的，這種好奇的尋味的動機，是當在我發覺她在休息的時候，還在努力的用工讀書的原故，我很想明白，她已經是一個都市中不幸的女子，終夜的去把生命消磨在那酒肉的交流的華貴富麗的魔窟中，她還有什麼心情可以努力用工呢？</p>
<p>然而我的好奇終於失望，在沒有尋求到的時候，我已是離開了那所房子了，從那時起，我已再沒有看到了她，而她給我的影象也漸漸地在記憶里淡薄而將至於消失了。</p>
<p>但是，在今晚，她又浮現在我的眼前了，她給我的印象又在我的腦中强調起來了，然而今晚的她，已不是一年前的她，已不是我所要尋味的一個不幸女子的生活的她了。但是，她今晚給我的印象是比前更深了，從她的臉上，我己看出她是爲生活而憔悴了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">War Zone Security Force Confirmed to Rotate Garrisons on the 11th, Hebei Provincial Government Issued Rotation Order Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Turnover Procedures, Defense Area Numbers All Specified</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government issued an order on the 8th: The Second Regiment of the Security Force stationed in Changli, Qian'an, Zunhua, and Leting, and the First Regiment of the Security Force stationed in Ji County, Shunyi, and Miyun, shall, no later than three days after the newly formed special police force enters to take over the defense, withdraw completely from the war zone. Furthermore, the Zhou Yuying unit stationed in Yutian will move to the Zunhua and Qian'an areas to suppress bandits, and the garrison rotation will be temporarily postponed. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng left Tianjin for Ping at 7:40 a.m. on the 8th. Yi Wo returned to Yuguan at 12:00 p.m. on the 7th. Tao Shangming plans to return to Tangshan by night train on the 8th. The Hebei Provincial Government formally issued the garrison rotation order for the newly formed special police force on the 8th. Zhang Qingyu's unit is delayed until the morning of the 11th due to insufficient requisitioned carts and will mobilize and march on foot into Yutian. Zhang Yantian's unit is negotiating with the Beining Railway Bureau for vehicles and can move on the 13th. The Hebei Provincial Government still prefers to use the title of the First and Second Regiments of the Hebei Provincial Special Police for Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian's units to distinguish them from the Liu Zuo Zhou and Zhao Lei units. The War Zone Security Supplementary Regiment of Li Yunsheng's unit stationed in Yanjiao began downsizing on the 8th, which will be completed next week. After the downsizing, one month's salary will be issued. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the garrison rotation issue of the War Zone Security Force, a satisfactory outcome has been achieved through talks between representatives of both sides in Tianjin. Japanese military officer Takahashi, who went to Tianjin to participate in the talks, and Yin Rugeng returned to Ping yesterday and today, respectively. Takahashi stated that the garrison rotation of the security force is expected to be realized on the 10th. The dispute regarding this issue has been satisfactorily resolved as a result of the Kwantung Army sending Yi Wo to Tianjin to discuss with Yu Xuezhong. He hopes that both China and Japan will strengthen communication in the future, and all issues within the war zone can be resolved at any time. He did not meet with Yu in Tianjin. After getting off the train, Yin Rugeng immediately visited Wang Kemin to report everything. Yin is scheduled to go to Tong County within days to preside over the garrison rotation of the security force. According to sources, the new security force is approved to begin garrison rotation on the 11th of this month. Zhang Qingyu is the First Regiment and will march on foot from Cai Village on the 11th, gathering in Tongzhou. Zhang Yantian is the Second Regiment and will travel by vehicle from Cangzhou to Tangshan on the same day to gather, and then move separately to their designated defense areas. The headquarters of the First Regiment is located in Ji County, and the headquarters of the Second Regiment is located in Liushouying. The Fan and Yang units to be transferred out will withdraw after the new unit completes the takeover of the defense. The Zhou Yuying, Zhao Lei, and Liu Zuo Zhou units will remain stationed in their original defense areas. The future titles have been agreed upon, changing to the First and Second Regiments of the Hebei Provincial Special Police Force, with 1,500 men in each regiment, totaling 3,000 men. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the turnover procedures and dates for the new and old security forces, a complete agreement has now been reached after discussions in Tianjin between Chinese and Japanese personnel. Yi Wo and Takahashi returned to Yuguan and Ping separately on the 7th. Yin Rugeng also returned to Ping on the morning of the 8th. After getting off the train, he went to the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee to visit Wang Kemin and report everything. According to sources, the Hebei Provincial Government issued two orders on the 8th, determining that the new and old security forces will rotate garrisons on the 11th. The First Regiment, Zhang Qingyu's unit, will march on foot from Cai Village to Ji County on the 12th to gather, and then depart to take over the defense of Miyun, Shunyi, Huairou, and Sanhe counties. The regimental headquarters is located in Ji County. The Second Regiment, Zhang Yantian's unit, will travel by train from Cangzhou to Tangshan on the same day to gather, and then disperse to take over the defense of Lu County, Changli, Funing, Qian'an, and Fengrun counties. The regimental headquarters is located in Liushouying. The old security force in the Ji-Mi area, except for Li Yunsheng's unit, which will remain stationed in Yanjiao and Xiasi after downsizing, and Zhou Yuying's unit, which will temporarily be stationed in Yutian to handle the clearance of the countryside, the Fan Jinghua unit stationed in Shunyi, Huairou, and Sanhe area will be transferred to Nanyuan first, and after reorganization, will be transferred south. In the Lu-Yu area, except for the Zhao Lei and Liu Zuo Zhou units, which will only be reorganized and not transferred for the time being, and the Feng Shou Peng unit, which will be downsized within days, the Yang Yucheng unit stationed in Lu County will be transferred back to Junliangcheng, reorganized, and then transferred to other locations for training. The old units will leave their original defense areas only after the new units arrive and complete the turnover of defense duties. The new units will uniformly change their designations to the Hebei Provincial Special Police Force. The number of personnel and firearms will remain as originally agreed, with no increases or decreases. There will be no more mustering before departure. All vehicles, rations, and housing needed for departure are being actively prepared. The Lu-Yu area may depart one or two days later due to more complicated procedures. Tao Shangming and Rugeng are scheduled to go to Tangshan and Tong County in person to coordinate the rotation in the coming days. The Tianjin meeting has already agreed on the future defense areas of Zhao Lei and Liu Zuo Zhou, and there are no problems. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming stated that the newly formed special police force's garrison rotation, the troops in the Ji-Mi area, are determined to depart on foot from Cai Village on the 10th. The Lu-Yu area is in the process of negotiating for vehicles. If there is not enough time, it may be delayed by two or three days. The garrison rotation will be completed within a week. The uniform naming and numbering of the units are currently being discussed. Tao is scheduled to return to Dianshan on the 8th. Yi Wo returned to Yuguan by night train on the 7th. Takahashi returned to Ping at 4:00 p.m. on the 7th. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The headquarters of the Second Regiment of the new special police force is determined to be located in Liushouying. The Liu Zuo Zhou unit, in addition to assigning two battalions to be stationed in Changli and Leting, will have its other two battalions stationed in Lu County, and the regimental headquarters will also be located there. The Zhao Lei unit's regimental headquarters is in Tangshan. The headquarters of the First and Third Battalions are located in Dian, the headquarters of the Second Battalion is located in Fengrun, and the Fourth Battalion is located in Kaiping. After Feng Shou Peng is reorganized into one battalion, he will also go to Xiasi to be stationed and clearly demarcate the defense area with the Zhao Xu unit. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Kwantung Army Restricts Japanese Merchants from Entering Mongolia <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the past, Japanese people bought Mongolian salt and wool in the Silingol League, the Ujumqin Erharana and other banners connected to Rehe, and the Chahar Department. After negotiations, the Japanese gradually withdrew, so the local areas of the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia have been peaceful for nearly a month. The Japanese Kwantung Army, due to the unrestricted entry of Japanese people into Mongolia, which led to unscrupulous merchants often causing resentment among the Mongolians, has specially stipulated measures to restrict Japanese merchants from entering Mongolia. Anyone who goes to Mongolia for profit or engages in activities that infringe upon the rights of Mongolians shall not be allowed to enter Mongolia.

<h3 id="e10">Ministry of Finance Stipulates to Abolish Transit Tax <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ministry of Finance News: 1. The abolition of transit tax has been decided to be implemented on June 1. The procedures are extremely simple. After the abolition, the issue of the retention or abolition of the sub-customs along the Yangtze River has been decided in principle to be abolished successively. However, the sub-customs usually bear the responsibility of collecting wharf fees in addition to transit taxes, so they will not be abolished immediately when the transit tax is abolished. This can only be achieved after the follow-up work is properly handled and other tax collection tasks are assigned to other agencies to handle at the same time, and it will take three or four months after the transit tax is abolished. 2. The measures for reducing or exempting export taxes, after research by the Tariff Research Association, include three principles: A. Tax exemptions will be granted to national products that the government should encourage for export. B. Appropriate reductions will be made for those that are needed in the domestic market and can replace imported goods. C. Those that are raw materials or have always been popular abroad will continue to be taxed as usual. The initial idea was to completely exempt national products from taxes in order to encourage them, but in order to take into account tax revenue, it was necessary to formulate them separately. If time permits, this measure can also be implemented on June 1. 3. Regarding the issue of prohibiting silver exports, the customs has always been very strict in cracking down on smuggling. After the silver crisis occurred, strict orders were issued to pay attention to smuggling exports and consulted with provincial and municipal governments for assistance, so the trend of smuggling silver exports has long disappeared. Although there were smuggling incidents by unscrupulous merchants in Hebei, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces in the past, they have also disappeared recently. As for the recent situation of customs revenue, it still maintains a normal state. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Twentieth National Humiliation Day Commemoration <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Flags are flown at half-mast. Banquets and entertainments are all suspended. Today, the people of the country are once again sadly commemorating the national humiliation of being forced to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. Since this day in the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai, under the duress of the "yes or no" threat from the ministers of the powerful nations, created this National Humiliation Day commemoration. In terms of time, twenty years have passed. In terms of degree, the nation's humiliation has increased, as if the annual commemoration has no effect at all. Grief and pain are only used for venting. Alas. Is it so? Is it really so?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the annual arrival of National Humiliation Day is like a loud alarm bell that sounds on time to warn the people of the country. The people of the country have the habit of languishing. The sound of this alarm bell can at least make them strive forward. The people of the country have the disease of numbness. The sound of this alarm bell can at least invigorate them. In addition, the disintegration of people's hearts and the lack of national self-confidence can all be corrected under the loud sound of this alarm bell. On this day twenty years ago, the "news" of Japan's delivery of the final ultimatum reached Shanghai. In its current commentary, this newspaper said, "The so-called ultimatum is something China has received many times. Has it therefore awakened? If it has awakened, then it is truly a gift from Japan." Today's emphasis on the effectiveness of the National Humiliation Day commemoration is also in this spirit. We especially hope that the effect of this bell will be even greater. The people of the country who hear the sound of this bell and strive forward, invigorate themselves, and make corrections should not be limited to the short period of time when the bell rings. Some people think that "the more national humiliations the Chinese people have, the thinner their aspirations become; the deeper the national humiliations, the weaker their aspirations become." This is a one-sided observation. On the day when the National Humiliation Day commemoration arrives, anyone with vitality who is stimulated by it will not fail to feel the importance of future responsibilities. This is precisely how it encourages the people of the country and stimulates their aspirations.</p>
<p>Alas. Sir John Jordan's words, "bury your head for ten years, and you may be able to look up at Japan," have become just a source of reminiscence today, twenty years later. Yuan Shikai's fear that "ten years later, China's danger will be even greater than it is today" has actually become today's reality. If the logical law of cause and effect is still valid, then everything in the past should be blamed on those who commemorate the National Humiliation Day not having fulfilled their commemorative responsibilities and not having found the deep way of commemoration. Now, the twentieth ringing of the alarm bell has shown us that the effort to strive forward cannot be delayed any longer, and the urgent effort to become strong will not allow procrastination. Time is no longer there. The people of the country should pay attention to it.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Because the Ministry of Justice's provisional examination for judicial officers was limited to graduates of national universities, graduates of private schools demanded to participate. A reporter went to inquire about the truth. According to the spokesman of the Ministry, this examination was due to the fact that last year, the Law School of Pingda University was allowed to recommend graduates with scores of 80 or above to enter the Judicial Officer Training Institute without examination. Later, after consulting the Examination Yuan, the Yuan replied that these students had not passed the examination and had no way to recognize that they had the equivalent qualifications to pass the preliminary examination for judicial officers in accordance with the law. That is to say, even if the training period of these students expires, they cannot obtain the qualifications of judicial officers. However, this case has been launched for more than half a year, and it would be difficult to withdraw the original case, so this provisional examination was specially held and approved by the National Government, and it will be limited to this time only. As for private university graduates, they can participate in the higher civil service examination for judicial officers. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Germany's Foreign Policy Leans Towards Compromise: Hitler to Deliver Speech, Completion of Military Buildup Not to be Rushed <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) German leader Hitler will convene the Reichstag on May 17th (some say the 15th) to deliver a speech reporting on Germany's foreign policy. According to sources in Berlin, Hitler's speech will likely lean towards a compromise attitude. Hitler will express his hope to conclude the Sky Mutual Assistance Agreement stipulated in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3rd, conclude a convention limiting aerial armaments, and conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty for Eastern Europe. Germany's adoption of this compromising attitude is due to the British government's expression of a firm stance at the Stresa Conference and during the recent House of Commons discussions on defense issues. In addition, the German National Defense Forces believe that diplomacy must be used as a cover to complete the plan for military reorganization, and therefore advocate a temporary moderate attitude. Meanwhile, Minister of Economy Schacht believes that the Central Bank currently lacks funds, and it would be difficult to remit large sums of money to purchase the raw materials necessary for manufacturing munitions, so he also advocates not rushing things too much. All of these are the reasons for the moderation of Germany's diplomatic attitude. (Seventh Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) After several members of the House of Lords expressed sympathy for Germany and approved of the foreign policy announced by Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons on May 2nd, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Stanhope stood up and replied that the British government earnestly hoped that Hitler's foreign policy statement, which he promised to deliver next week, would be the prelude to Germany's constructive actions and could be seen as the realization of his oft-proclaimed peaceful wishes. Stanhope also cited the words of Foreign Secretary Simon last week, saying that Germany should restore Europe's sense of security through actions rather than words. In response to a suggestion from a member that the government should reorganize the Disarmament Conference, Stanhope said that it was currently difficult for Britain to propose European land army figures that could be approved by the public. It would be good if Hitler could give us figures. Now that Germany has put forward practical proposals, we will see if we can obtain a sky convention in accordance with our policy. The British government has drafted a sky convention for reference. He has no doubt that France and Italy will do the same. We can exchange drafts with each other, and wait for Germany to put forward one as well. Then we can see whether Germany will put forward practical proposals that can allow us to hold disarmament talks in a military manner. Germany is very unhappy with the Eastern European Convention and other agreements we have made with other countries. We should see if we can approve Germany's proposals. Disarmament proposals, if they are concrete, practical, and fair, can be made by anyone. Stanhope then mentioned naval affairs, saying that we are currently proposing negotiations, but any proposals put forward must be submitted to the signatories of the Washington and London Naval Treaties for review.

<p>(London) Sir Dickinson moved in the House of Lords today, arguing that the House should express regret for the resolution passed by the League of Nations Executive Council on April 16th condemning Germany's military reorganization, as it could cause international disputes. The British government should unite with other countries and reopen negotiations with Germany based on principles that can be accepted by the Germans and guarantee lasting peace. Dickinson solemnly announced the reasons for his motion, stating that restoring the atmosphere before the war would definitely lead to conflict. Therefore, it is unwise to accuse Germany of violating the treaty without giving it a chance to defend itself. It is essential to consider the events of March with a fair view. If Europe is divided into two major hostile groups, and Germany and the Allied Powers are in a stalemate, there can be no peace. We must end mutual hostility and seek coordination on the basis of cooperation. It is in our interest for Germany to gain its proper place in the international arena. We should be frank with each other. The House then began to debate. Sir Mather claimed that it was not too late to avoid Germany's isolation. Germany's isolation will definitely lead to a new world war. He deeply believes that no one in Germany today wants to provoke Britain. Lord Cecil held the opposite view and spoke out against Germany.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons today that if any signatory of the Air Defense Convention is attacked by an enemy, Britain's air force will definitely take action to protect it. This was the Foreign Secretary's reply to a question from Member of Parliament Monte. Simon also said, "Our responsibilities are clearly stated in the Locarno Treaty, and we will faithfully fulfill them if necessary." It is reported that Monte asked whether Britain would assist France with its full military force based on the Air Defense Convention. Although the Foreign Secretary's reply did not explicitly state that Britain would fully fulfill the treaty, observers believe that France's operations cannot be carried out solely by the air force. Therefore, if British aircraft fight with other countries' aircraft, it is equivalent to a formal declaration of war. The Locarno Treaty was an agreement between Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany that if any country is attacked, the remaining signatory countries will jointly assist it. If the attack is not of an aggressive nature, the League of Nations must determine who is right and who is wrong before deciding which country to assist. British politicians believe that this treaty has the function of maintaining peace in Europe. The Foreign Secretary's statement in the House of Commons today is generally regarded as a new promise from Britain to show goodwill to other countries. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The British overseas dominions now support maintaining the group guarantee system for European peace. According to reports from political visitors in this morning's newspapers, this was the result of yesterday's meeting between the prime ministers of the various dominions and British cabinet members to discuss the international situation. The dominions all believe that Germany should be treated equally, but require German leader Hitler to show that Germany's words and deeds are trustworthy. The most important issue at yesterday's meeting was the dominions' opinions on British foreign policy and European obligations. Every Day News reported that a method could be established allowing British representatives to make quick decisions on behalf of the British Empire at European conferences without consulting with each individual dominion. However, the dominions reserve the right to approve or reject such decisions. If so, Britain will no longer have the current difficulty of having to consult with the dominions before making a decision at European conferences. (Eighth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The British King, accompanied by the Queen and the Duke of Gloucester, traveled by car from Buckingham Palace to St. James's Palace today to thank the world for their congratulations on the Silver Jubilee of his reign. Although the King and Queen traveled in a carriage and there were no formalities, a large number of people gathered along the way to watch them pass by. The King received ambassadors and envoys from various countries and representatives of the Empire in the Throne Room. The prime ministers of the dominions were also among them. Prime Minister MacDonald and several cabinet members wore Jubilee Medals and were also present. First, the leader of the diplomatic corps, the Brazilian ambassador, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the diplomatic corps. Then, the four prime ministers of the Empire represented the dominions to offer their congratulations in turn, presenting their congratulatory messages. Next, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Huggins, delivered a short speech. Then, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Thomas, represented Newfoundland, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lister, represented the various colonies, and Sir Parr represented India, delivering speeches in order. Finally, the King spoke, thanking the world for the congratulatory telegrams sent from all over the world, and expressing his gratitude to the representatives of the dominions, saying that the dominions and the motherland are truly one family, sharing joys and sorrows without borders. This spirit of unity may be the bond of peace, which is what I deeply believe and pray for. Many of the ministers are close to my age. I pray that God will continue to bless your labor. I will work with you in my remaining years to seek the happiness of the motherland, overseas dominions, and India, as well as their joy and good reputation. The King's words were very sincere and moved the listeners. Yesterday, the King and Queen were able to rest a little after the busy celebrations. The King remained quiet all day, and he and the Queen drove to Hyde Park in the afternoon, receiving cheers from thousands of people. Yesterday's ceremony only consisted of the Crown Prince hosting guests at St. James's Palace, shaking hands with 2,000 people, including cabinet members, dominion representatives, and the diplomatic corps. In the evening, a large crowd gathered outside Buckingham Palace, cheering incessantly. The King and Queen appeared on the porch for a few minutes, during which the crowd shouted "God Save the King" and sang the national anthem. The King and Queen waved repeatedly to express their gratitude. (Eighth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Honolulu: Forty-two U.S. Navy aircraft are scheduled to fly out of Pearl Harbor at 6:00 a.m. on Thursday, a scale that will set a new record in U.S. aviation history. More than 200 officers are participating in the exercise, commanded by Commander Dodd. This exercise is part of the U.S. Navy's determination of its future tactics. At the same time, this air force will join the U.S. Navy, which is currently approaching Midway Island, and then form an offensive force. It is said that this time the U.S. Navy's exercise in the Pacific includes more than 450 aircraft carried by aircraft carriers and battleships. However, the details of a certain exercise have never been made public. Even naval officers cannot know the current location of the various ships, because wireless communications have been stopped and they rely solely on the various confidential introductions prepared in advance for timely use. Even the 42 aircraft that are now preparing to depart from Pearl Harbor were ordered by General Leff of the U.S. Navy Headquarters, the reason for which is not clear at all. Therefore, for the time being, even the officers participating in this exercise will find it difficult to understand the reason until they reach the appropriate location. The U.S. Navy aircraft surveyed the flight site on Midway Island in February 1934. Therefore, it is not impossible to say that this formation flight of 42 aircraft was planned a year ago.

Therefore, this is enough to make the Little Entente prevent Hungary and Bulgaria from implementing conscription.

<p>(Paris) The Soviet Russian authorities have refused to issue passports to several French newspaper special reporters who planned to accompany French Foreign Minister Laval to Moscow. Therefore, while the French Foreign Minister is visiting the Russian capital with good intentions, the French newspapers are severely criticizing Soviet Russia.

However, other French newspapers that have obtained reporter passports are also voicing their grievances for their colleagues, protesting the actions of the Russian authorities.

<p>Warsaw: Poland promulgated a new constitution on April 23 of this year. However, the election law for members of Congress is stipulated to be formulated separately. This draft election law has now been completed. The main point is to seriously restrict the activities of various political parties, stipulating that candidates for members of Congress shall not be nominated by political parties, but shall be nominated by election committees in various districts. The election of the House of Representatives divides the country into 100 election districts, with each election district electing two members, for a total of 200 members of the House of Representatives. It is stipulated that each election district nominates four candidates. Before the election, representatives from the county, township, city, chamber of commerce, labor union, farmers' association, and other professional organizations in each election district form an election committee to nominate candidates for members of Congress. Representatives attending the election committee may nominate candidates for members of Congress. If the number of candidates for members of Congress nominated exceeds four, the election committee will hold a vote to determine the four candidates with the most votes as the candidates for the district. The Senate has 96 senators, one-third of whom, or 32, are appointed by the President. In addition, 64 members are elected by election committees organized by each province separately. Citizens with special qualifications and prestige are required to serve as representatives of the Senate election committee. Once this draft election law is implemented, the power of various political parties will inevitably decline. Therefore, the various Polish parties are now strongly opposed to the draft election law.

<p>Over 280,000 Italian Troops Gather in East Africa</p>
<p>(Rome) According to the semi-official Stefani News Agency, Italy's plan to further safeguard its East African territories has become necessary. The reasons are as follows: (1) It has been confirmed that European arms companies are transporting large quantities of arms to the Abyssinian capital. (2) Abyssinia has already adopted a mobilization plan. (3) The Abyssinian King recently made a statement. Therefore, Prime Minister Mussolini has ordered the mobilization of one regular army division and two Blackshirt divisions. According to reliable estimates, the number of soldiers sent to East Africa has exceeded 280,000. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini today ordered 280,000 Italian soldiers to prepare for war to deal with the crisis on the border between Italian East Africa and Abyssinia. The number of troops Italy has sent to East Africa to assist 25,000 Italian colonial soldiers is already over 105,000. Mussolini claimed that his actions were purely to ensure the safety of Italian East Africa, because recently Abyssinia has not only purchased large quantities of military supplies from abroad, but the Abyssinian King has also mobilized various tribes to prepare for war. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Following the issuance of the new mobilization order today, Colonial Undersecretary Lessona declared in the Chamber of Deputies that Italy must ensure that the attacks on Walwal and Afduu are prevented from happening again. Italy is willing to respect the 1928 treaty, so the future of African colonies is expected to be peaceful. In the past forty years, with the assistance of certain European countries, Abyssinia has used force to destroy three indigenous states and has become a large slave-trading colony. The Italian government can no longer tolerate the current situation in Abyssinia, and it is now time to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian relationship once and for all. The Abyssinian government has violated the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty of Friendship. Of the three actual bloodshed incidents that occurred in East Africa, the Abyssinian government has only handled one satisfactorily. However, there is something more important than this: there is solid evidence that Abyssinia harbors animosity towards Italy. The Italian government has treated Abyssinia generously, opening a free zone in the port of Assab against the wishes of the Abyssinian Emperor and providing trade facilities in its East African colonies. The Abyssinian government is now repaying kindness with ingratitude and harbors a very serious aggressive intent towards Italy. Abyssinia is not a country of the same race or the same religion. This is an undeniable fact. Therefore, Italy really needs to clarify the overall situation. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated regarding today's new mobilization order that Abyssinia has recently imported large quantities of military supplies, especially machine guns. This matter is extremely noteworthy. Several European countries are now supplying arms to non-white people to be used to kill white Italians, so Italy has no choice but to prepare. Mussolini cannot tolerate this situation. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council convened a meeting in the east wing of the Imperial Palace at 7:00 this morning. All Privy Councilors, including Vice-Chairman Hiranuma, attended. Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Okada, and Kanamori, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, also attended the meeting. The meeting began under the personal presence of the Emperor. First, Tomii, Chairman of the Examination Committee, reported on the content of the Cabinet Deliberative Council and the Investigation Bureau, saying that the Examination Committee trusted the government's explanation that the Deliberative Council was an advisory body and would not restrict the government's administration, and attached hope to it. Subsequently, a vote was taken, and the result was unanimous approval. The establishment of the two bodies has completed the procedural formalities. (Hualian News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Cabinet Secretary Yoshida Shigeru has been transferred to the post of Director of the Investigation Bureau. It has now been confirmed that Takesuke Shirane, the former governor of Hyogo Prefecture, will succeed him as Chief Secretary. (Japan News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Cabinet Secretary, Takesuke Shirane, was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture in the 16th year of the Meiji era [1883]. In the 41st year of Meiji [1908], he graduated from the Department of Political Science at Tokyo University. He first served in the Shizuoka Prefectural Office, and later served as the Director of Internal Affairs in the prefectural governments of Yamagata, Kyoto, and Tokyo. In the 2nd year of Showa [1927], he was appointed Governor of Toyama Prefecture, and then Governor of Hyogo Prefecture. He is 53 years old this year and has a very close relationship with Interior Minister Goto. This appointment is said to be due to Interior Minister Goto's strong recommendation.

<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" government, which is implementing the replacement of Japanese officials in "Manchukuo," has contacted and studied the matter with the Kwantung Army and other overseas government offices. A policy has already been decided. Lieutenant General Itagaki, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, who came to Tokyo after attending the Chief of Staff meeting, took this policy and negotiated with other related parties in the Army Central Department. The Central Department has expressed its approval, so Lieutenant General Itagaki hurriedly returned to Manchukuo on the 5th in order to implement it immediately. The scope of this change is quite extensive, and it emphasizes the replacement of senior officials. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">US Senate Passes Patman Bill; Issue Paper Money Worth 2 Billion Dollars to Pay Veteran Bonuses <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Presidential Veto Expected</p>
<p>(Washington) There are three types of veteran bonus bills: the Vinson Bill, the Harrison Bill, and the Patman Bill. The Vinson Bill proposes to issue transferable treasury bonds to raise funds. The Harrison Bill proposes to advance the maturity date of the bonus certificates held by veterans from 1945 to 1938 and issue 3% bonds to exchange for the currently held certificates. Those who wish to wait until 1945 to redeem them will be given 4% compound interest. The Patman Bill proposes to issue paper money worth 2 billion dollars to pay the bonuses in cash. Today, the Senate disregarded President Roosevelt's warning and voted to replace the Harrison Bill with the Vinson Bill. Thus, the Harrison Bill was shelved, and the Senate only had to choose between the Patman Bill and the Vinson Bill. It was expected that the Senate would not consider the Patman Bill until tomorrow, but the Senate acted quickly and passed the Patman Bill today by a vote of 55 to 33. Since the Patman Bill had already been passed by the House of Representatives, it is now sent to the White House. A presidential veto is expected. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Banking circles today predicted that if the President vetoes the veteran bonus bill and the Senate still passes it by a two-thirds majority, the United States will experience temporary inflation, and some businesses may be stimulated by it. As for the unprepared issuance of 2 billion dollars in paper money, although it may not have a serious impact, if it is implemented, it may trigger a real inflationary policy. The financial community believes that prices may not rise sharply immediately as a result, and stocks may not fall sharply either. The general public will probably wait and see and take action after the bonus advocates demonstrate their strength. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">US Monetary Policy to Undergo Major Changes; Treasury Secretary Scheduled to Broadcast Speech on Monday <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will deliver a radio broadcast to the nation next Monday. Today, various speculations have arisen here. Some believe that the government's accumulated cash is increasing too rapidly, causing anxiety. Therefore, the Treasury Secretary may announce that the government's monetary policy will undergo extremely important changes. It is reported that as of yesterday, the Treasury Department's gold reserves had reached a new record of $8,725,321,3788, while the current silver reserves are only about $1,500,000,000. Recently, the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly consulted with Professor Warren of Cornell University and the famous economist Professor Fisher, who originally initiated the silver purchase policy. It is also understood that the Treasury Secretary has studied in detail various statistics on foreign trade. According to some opinions, the US silver policy not only disrupts world finance but also harms the government's main goal, which is to stabilize the currency. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House silver faction members are dissatisfied with the progress of the silver purchase program and have drafted a petition. If half of the 435 members sign it, the 16-to-1 silver coinage plan will be considered by the House by a special committee. However, it is doubtful whether the necessary number of signatures can be obtained. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is scheduled to deliver a radio address on Monday night to inform the nation, entitled "The Dollar." Whether the Treasury Secretary can express the government's correct opinion at that time has aroused general speculation. The Treasury Secretary stated today that the topic of his speech is quite broad. He will answer questions about the steps the government has already taken and review the past history of monetary policy. It is expected that the Treasury Secretary will also mention the silver issue, but when asked by reporters today, Morgenthau only said that the meaning of Congress's order is very clear and does not need further elaboration. It is generally rumored that the Treasury Secretary's speech will include various important announcements, perhaps mentioning the possibility of the government raising the price of silver to $1.29 and limiting silver purchases to domestic sources, but there is no basis for this rumor. It is also said that the Treasury Secretary's radio address is only intended to test the nation's attitude towards the movement to stabilize currency values, as all parties now acknowledge that the time for stabilization has arrived. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House Democrat Representative Wright introduced a bill today calling for the 16-to-1 gold and silver bimetallism plan to be put to a vote immediately. Wright stated that issuing silver certificates to purchase silver to increase the use of silver is clearly the only way to replenish the gold certificates that have been withdrawn. After the use of silver and silver certificates is expanded, silver can become a currency without interest payments. It is claimed that to restore silver as currency, a majority of 217 votes is required, but silver faction members believe that this number can be obtained soon. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Conditional on Not Bearing Obligation of Armed Intervention</p>
<p>(Washington) The issue of the United States joining the League of Nations has now been revived. Senator Pope has introduced a bill in the Senate to allow the United States to become a member of the League of Nations under certain conditions. The main conditions are: (1) The clauses of the League Covenant regarding cooperation to prevent war shall not compel the United States to use force. (2) The decision on what action the United States should take in the event of a breach of peace shall be made by the US government itself. Pope stated that passive action alone is not enough. The world cannot create peace and place it before the United States. The United States must obtain it through constructive efforts. Prevention in advance is more important than trying to avoid war after it has broken out. Pope did not ask the Senate to deal with this proposal immediately, so Congress may not publicly debate it at present, but this case is bound to spark national discussion. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee on Traffic in Women and Children of the League of Nations recently met here to discuss the living conditions of White Russian women in the Far East. Chaired by Chilean representative Garcí-Oldo, the meeting was attended by Father Jin, elder of the Catholic Church of the Three Virtues, who has lived in China for many years. He reported that there are about 20,000 White Russian women in China, of whom about 3,000 to 6,000 rely on prostitution for a living. The proportion is shockingly high. The reason is that after White Russian women arrive in China, they fall into extreme poverty and have no way to make a living, which leads them to being forced into brothels. Therefore, Father Jin suggested cooperating with the Chinese authorities to study the problem of trafficking in White Russian women, first establishing agencies in Shanghai, Tianjin, Harbin, and Shenyang to engage in relief work. He also said that church personnel in China have organized voluntary relief agencies, which have been assisted by local governments, and have achieved good results. In the future, the League of Nations should coordinate the relief work of local churches and governments to rescue White Russian women from misery. The Committee on Traffic in Women and Children is now drafting a resolution based on Father Jin's suggestions. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Havana: The Cuban government has decided to impose high tariffs on Japanese goods again. The situation as announced on the 7th is as follows:</p>
<p>All Japanese-made textiles and the like must be subject to import tax. (1) The tax rate on cotton textiles must be increased by another 25% over the highest tax rate. (2) A 100% tariff must be levied on rayon textiles and rayon-cotton blended textiles and silk textiles. (Japan News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cuban government has increased tariffs on Japanese cloth on the 7th. Cotton textiles are subject to a 25% increase in addition to the highest tax rate, and silk and rayon textiles are subject to a 100% tariff. It is rumored that because cotton textiles are subject to ad valorem duty, a total of 9.84 million square yards were exported from January to March this year, but the future export of Japanese cloth will be quite difficult. This tariff increase is a fatal blow to cloth merchants. Since silk and rayon textiles were originally subject to ad valorem duty, the 100% tariff can be described as a ban on imports. Therefore, the export of Japanese goods will be completely impossible in the future. However, since the export volume has always been minimal, it will not affect the overall situation.

<p>Springfield, USA: A serious situation has arisen in Illinois. All relief stations have been closed, causing 200,000 men, women, and children to starve and freeze. Today, 500 starving people marched in protest to the capital of Illinois, demanding the immediate reopening of relief stations. It is reported that the Illinois authorities did not hand over the relief funds to the central government, so Hopkins, Director of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, retaliated by closing the relief stations in the state. A delegation representing the demonstrators today petitioned the Illinois legislature to raise the necessary relief funds. Illinois Governor Horner replied that the only way to raise funds is for the legislature to pass two proposals authorizing the sales tax to be increased from 2% to 3%, which would generate 3 million dollars per month. However, a few Republican state legislators said that they would oppose the increase in the sales tax and would not allow it to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) Hunan Anti-Smoking Committee Chairman He Jian yesterday hosted the Changsha press to report on the steps to ban opium, which are divided into four categories: banning planting, banning transportation, banning sales, and banning smoking. The measures include strictly implementing general denunciations to eradicate the roots of poisonous plants; banning sales by cracking down on raw opium shops and enforcing strict management; banning smoking by setting deadlines for registration and gradually reducing the number of smokers; and banning transportation by the Anti-Smoking Inspection Office, which is responsible for strictly following Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's six-year anti-drug policy to completely ban it. This time, the order to ban opium is extremely serious. Anyone who violates the opium ban will be shot without exception. It is hoped that the public will be awakened to automatically quit and not ignore it, lest they fall into the clutches of the law. Subsequently, Committee Member Zhang Gangfeng made a detailed report on the gradual implementation of anti-smoking measures and plans to imitate Jiangsu's anti-smoking model by establishing designated smoking areas to show restrictions. As for party, government, military, and public officials, as well as school staff and students, smoking is absolutely prohibited, and they must obtain joint and several liability pledges. If anyone is found smoking, they will be shot without exception and without leniency. (7th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Disputes over Coal Mine Boundaries in Liujiang <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military Police Demolish Light Railway, Construction Department Orders Linyu County Magistrate to Negotiate</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: At around 9:00 AM on the 4th of this month, more than 30 Japanese policemen from Qinhuangdao and Yuguan, led by Sato, the chief of the Japanese Police Station in Dongluocheng, Shanhaiguan, along with a squad of Japanese military police, forcibly sealed off the pier and warehouses of the Liujiang Coal Mine in Qinhuangdao and demolished the railway connecting Qinhuangdao to the Liujiang mining area. At that time, a passenger train on the line was about to start, but it was forcibly stopped by the Japanese military police, and all the passengers on the train were driven off, cutting off transportation. Because it was difficult to transport coal, the Liujiang Coal Mine stopped work on the afternoon of the 4th, and the manager telegraphed the Construction Department, requesting a speedy negotiation to avoid long-term losses. Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, met with Sato, the chief of the Shanhaiguan Japanese Police Station, and Ishida Hisatomo, the Japanese manager of the Taiki Coal Mining Company, who was involved in the incident, and discussed the matter. The Japanese side also did not want the negotiation to escalate and planned to resolve it locally. Magistrate Yuan came to Tianjin on the night of the 4th to ask for instructions from the provincial government's Construction Department and decided to return to Linyu on the night of the 6th to invite all parties involved to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>The cause of this incident was investigated as follows: The Liujiang Coal Mine is a commercial joint-stock company, and its major shareholder is Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The mine's smokeless coal is one of the leading mineral products in North China and is sold throughout the country. The business is very good. A light railway of more than 40 li was built from Qinhuangdao to the mining area. In addition to transporting coal, it also handles passenger and freight transportation. It has been in operation for more than 20 years. The mining area covers more than 4,000 mu. Adjacent to it is the Taiki Coal Mining Company, whose original license holder was Sun Jiwu. It was approved by the Ministry in the third year of the Republic of China. Later, Sun formed a Sino-Japanese joint venture with the Japanese, with Sun as the Chinese chairman and the Japanese, Ishida Hisatomo, as the Japanese chairman. The mining area also occupies an area of 4,000 mu. However, since obtaining the license, although mining has been carried out, it has been repeatedly interrupted. In March of this year, Ishida claimed that since Jiwu had died, he planned to start operations himself. However, because the coal seam was slightly inferior to Liujiang, fearing that the output would not be strong, Ishida, based on the unclear replacement map from the sixth year of the Republic of China, strongly argued that the Black Stone Nest mining area, which is adjacent to the two mines and covers an area of about 1,000 mu, belonged to Taiki. The two sides argued privately several times, but without results. Later, Ishida filed a complaint with the Tianjin Consulate, which was forwarded to the Shanhaiguan Police Station and the Linyu County Magistrate for negotiation (because the two mining areas are south of the Great Wall and are both under the jurisdiction of Linyu County). The Linyu County Magistrate forwarded the details to the Construction Department, which checked the mining law and the Ministry's records and found that Liujiang Coal Mine's mining of the Black Stone Nest mine did not infringe on any facts. Just as the Linyu County Magistrate Yuan Tai was ordered to handle the matter, the Japanese military police, led by Ishida, demolished the railway and sealed off the warehouse as a threat. Yuan Tai returned to Linyu to negotiate under the order of the provincial government's Construction Department. As for the outcome, it depends on the attitude of the Japanese side. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Conditions of Relief Undertakings in Guangdong Province <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Essential Work in the Administration Plan, Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Assist Counties in Handling</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province, in accordance with Article 11 of the Founding Program, has clearly defined relief undertakings as essential work in the administration in the three-year administration plan, and the Civil Affairs Department is actively supervising its implementation. In addition to allocating funds for disaster relief in the event of temporary disasters and ordering various counties to sort out warehouse storage and store grain to prepare for famine, strictly prohibiting adulteration to maintain people's food supply, special attention is paid to supervising various counties to handle old-age homes, infant care centers, public hospitals, and pauper asylums, etc., in accordance with the current three-year plan. Because various counties have difficulty raising funds, they have also been ordered to handle matters flexibly, combining old-age homes, orphanages, orphanages, pauper asylums, and hospitals into relief homes to handle various relief matters, or to run public hospitals separately. However, most counties are poor and have difficulty raising funds. Few counties have established or prepared relief homes and public hospitals in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Therefore, in January of this year, it was approved that counties that can raise funds locally to establish or prepare various institutions will be given a subsidy of 200 yuan each by the province. Counties that have received this subsidy include Longmen, Chixi, Heshan, Chaoyang, Chenghai, Xingning, Lechang, Qujiang, Lianshan, Wuchuan, Suixi, and Wenchang for the funding of the establishment of relief homes, and Huaxian, Conghua, Deqing, Longchuan, Lufeng, Dapu, Xingning, Wuhua, Haifeng, Chaoyang, Chenghai, and Wenchang for the funding of the establishment of public hospitals. However, most counties are unable to raise funds to establish various institutions, so they submitted a request to the provincial government, requesting a large amount of funding to be allocated in stages as funding for the establishment of relief homes and public hospitals. It is estimated that Lianping, Fogang, Jiaoling, Lezeng, Ruyuan, and Kaijian will each receive 4,000 yuan, and Haifeng, Raoping, Beixian, Dapu, Yangshan, Heping, Wengyuan, Longmen, Xinfeng, Xuwen, Lingshui, Pingsu, Lianshan, Qiongdong, Ganen, Changjiang, and Nanao, 17 counties, will each receive 3,000 yuan, Huiyang, Qujiang, Hepu, Lingshan, Xinyi, Xingning, Lufeng, Yingde, Lianjiang, Boluo, Qinxian, Heyuan, Zengcheng, Puning, Nanxiong, Wuhua, Yunfu, Suixi, Huilai, Deqing, Longchuan, Enping, Yunan, Lianxian, Zijin, Yaxian, Dingan, Sihui, Wanning, Xinxing, Chengmai, Fengshun, Huaxian, Shixing, Lingao, Baoan, Wuchuan, Lechang, Gaoming, and Renhua, Chixi, 41 counties, will each receive 2,000 yuan, Guangning, Huaxian, Dianbai, Conghua, Fengchuan, 5 counties, will each receive 1,000 yuan, Meilu Administration Bureau 1,000 yuan, and Lianyang Huayi Bureau medical expenses 1,000 yuan, for a total allocation of 164,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Currently, the counties that have achieved more success in handling relief undertakings are: Panyu Old-Age Home, which houses more than 60 poor elderly men and women; the Skills Training Center, which houses more than 150 apprentices; Nanhai Foshan Relief Home, which houses more than 80 orphans; Jiujiang Relief Home, which houses more than 50 poor men and women; Heshan Relief Home, which houses more than 110 poor men and women; Zengcheng Infant Care Center, which houses about 20 female infants; Yunfu Old-Age Relief Home, which houses more than 30 poor men and women; Infant Care Center, which houses about 20 female infants; Huilai Infant Care Center, which houses more than 10 female infants; Luoding Infant Hall, which houses 16 female infants; Guangning Relief Home, which houses 37 poor men and women; Gaoyao Relief Home, which houses 49 poor men and women; Heyuan Relief Home, which houses 16 poor men and women; Zengyang Old-Age Home and Pauper Asylum, which house more than 60 poor men and women; Infant Care Center, which houses 72 infants; Dongguan Relief Home, which houses 112 orphans; Deqing Infant Care Center, which houses 26 infants; Shunde Relief Home, which houses 135 poor people and 30 homeless elderly people. In addition, Daliang Infant Care Center and Chencun Infant Care Center, the number of housed is not known; Chaoan Pauper Asylum, which houses 291 poor men and women; Infant Hall, which houses 46 female infants; Conghua Relief Home, the number of housed is not known; Qingyuan Infant Hall, which houses 22 female infants; Chenghai Infant Care Center, the number of housed is not known; Old-Age Home, which houses more than 10 poor men and women; Gaoming Old-Age Home, which houses 18 poor elderly men and women; Haikang Old-Age Home and Disability Center, which house more than 50 poor elderly people and disabled poor people; Qi Infant Center houses seven female infants; Maoming Relief Home and Universal Relief Home house over 100 poor men and women; the Infant Care Center houses eight female infants; Shantou Pauper Labor Arts Institute, which houses 477 homeless poor people, 90 orphans, 108 poor elderly people, and 113 disabled poor people.</p>
<p>As for the counties that have been planning to establish public hospitals or public hospitals, there are 49 counties and cities, including Panyu, Nanhai, Dongguan, Shunde, Zhongshan, Xinhui, Taishan, Baoan, Zengcheng, Qingyuan, Sihui, Chixi, Gaoming, Guangning, Heshan, Kaijian, Fengshun, Lufeng, Chaoyang, Jieyang, Chenghai, Huilai, Nanxiong, Lechang, Shixing, Maoming, Xinyi, Lianjiang, Haikang, Yangjiang, Yangchun, Qiongshan, Dingan, Lingshui, Fangcheng, Lingshan, Luoding, Kaiping, Yunfu, Yunan, Huiyang, Boluo, Chaoan, Xingning, Qujiang, Wengyuan, Yingde, Dianbai, and Shantou. Other unformed relief homes and public hospitals are still being urged to prepare for establishment.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department has now promulgated the Relief Home Organization Rules, stipulating that each county and municipal government must establish a relief home to handle old-age homes, orphanages, disability homes, infant care centers, medical clinics, and loan centers, etc. The management of equipment in each institution and the procedures for entering and leaving the institution are clearly stipulated and must be supervised by the county government. The loan center is specifically for those who do not have bad habits and are willing to start a small business. If they have the above-mentioned aspirations and have a guarantor or equivalent guarantor, they will be given a loan of five to twenty yuan, without interest. After that, they will repay it in installments on schedule. If they fail to repay it on time, the guarantor will repay it on their behalf. If there are special circumstances, it can be handled according to the circumstances. If this relief home can be promoted and expanded, not only will the lonely and helpless each find their place, but the unemployed poor will also be reduced. As for the rules of the relief home, the most important thing is the provision of funds. The funds of the home are supplemented by local income and donations. However, the fund should be organized by local legal groups to elect a number of people to form a fund management committee to manage separately. All immovable property must be approved by the competent authority before it can be sold. In this way, there is not only a source of funds, but also strict supervision and management, so that there will be no corruption or self-enrichment.</p>
<h3 id="e87">76 Notorious Bandits in Jiaodong Executed <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Xu Rongzhang and 4 Other Bandits Beheaded Inside the Provincial Government, the Remaining 69 Escorted to the Execution Ground for Justice</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In order to pacify Jiaodong, Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, specially appointed Liu Yaoting, captain of the Third Route Special Detective Team, as the guerrilla commander of Jiaodong last month to go to more than ten counties in eastern Shandong, including Gaomi, Jiaozhou, Jimo, Pingdu, Changyi, Zhucheng, and Rizhao, to carry out the work of eliminating bandits, combining suppression and appeasement to achieve lasting peace. After Liu received the order, he set up an office to work. The famous Jiaodong bandit leaders Xu Rongzhang, Shi Linfu, Guo Bingzhong, Guo Pijian, and Shan Yizhi surrendered one after another. Xu and others had been bandit leaders for seven or eight to ten years, leading hundreds to two or three thousand bandits. They claimed to have turned over a new leaf, willing to serve the local area, and take full responsibility for Jiaodong's security and bandit suppression. Currently, there are 74 bandits who have all been concentrated in Gaomi. After Liu Yaoting contacted them in many ways and completed the formalities, he followed Han Fuju's order and transferred all 74 bandits to Jinan to await inspection and training. It was originally planned to incorporate them into a detective team to serve the local area and be responsible for eliminating scattered bandits in eastern Shandong. Unexpectedly, although Xu and other bandits had surrendered, they still secretly left a group of followers in the Jiaodong area, secretly kidnapping and extorting ransoms, selling tickets, and other illegal activities. A few days ago, they even kidnapped more than a dozen students in Jimo. Liu Yaoting discovered the matter and reported it to Han Fuju and Shi Jingzhou, director of the Military Law Department of the headquarters. At the same time, the detectives of the detective team also hated Xu and other bandits and were unwilling to associate with them. After receiving the report, Han Fuju believed that Xu and other bandits were so lawless, which was extremely heinous, and ordered that Xu and other bandits be executed to show a warning. After receiving the order, Liu Yaoting brought Xu and others to the Military Law Department inside the provincial government at 6:00 PM on the 6th under the pretext of training. With an order, Liu Yaoting directed the detectives to behead Xu Rongzhang, Shi Linfu, Guo Bingzhong, Guo Pijian, and Shan Yizhi in the courtyard. At the same time, he tied up the remaining 69 bandits, including Sun Jingshan, and escorted them to an empty space outside Nanweimen, verified their identities, and completely shot them. The execution was completed by 8:00 PM. All those who were tied up and taken to the execution ground were handled by the members of the detective team, who were swift and agile. The names of the bandits who were shot are recorded below: Bandit leaders Xu Rongzhang, Shan Yizhi, Shi Linfu, Guo Bingzhong, Guo Pijian, notorious bandits Zhang Zifu, Guo Zixiu, Dong Yuntian, Yu Dengyuan, Guo Cunhe, Pan Shaojiu, Li Baichuan, Chu Jilu, Tang Qishan, Yu Zhanhao, Dong Yunmei, Yu Shengzhi, Zhang Qingdao, Zhang Derui, Guo Jincheng, Li Jiuchun, Sun Mingshan, Zhang Minggong, Sun Baolong, Dong Shuqi, Sun Ruiting, Liu Youlu, Kuang Guangchun, Wan Xuchang, Wu Jinzhi, Dou Xuekong, Wu Yongcai, Gao Yueshou, Yin Dexin, Xue Fuzhen, Xu Shuqing, Wu Xisheng, Guo Xuli, Lu Xicai, Sun Jingshan, Dai Jusheng, Sun Weiting, Leng Xitang, Dai Zengshan, Chen Fushan, Zhang Fuxun, Liu Futian, Gao Huan, Wang Jinyu, Wang Zifa, Liu Bulin, Wang Mingshan, Zhang Junyan, Zhang Yunting, Wu Xiaofeng, Zhang Yuanxiu, Gao Zhenming, Zhang Zhongjing, Zhang Ziyu, Gao Zengtang, Wang Fengting, Liu Xidong, Zhang Shouxu, Shi Yudong, Shi Yulu, Cui Naiqi, Hua Kun, Leng Fubin, Gao Cunben, Wan Demi, Liu Shouxian, Zheng Zhiguang, Li Taichen, and Wan Renchen.

<h3 id="e88">Notorious Bandit of Southern Shandong, Zhang Black Face, Brought to Justice (Continued) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Special Detective of Shandong captured Zhang while he was hiding in Anhui Province, and after interrogation by Han Fuju, he was immediately executed.</p>
<p>Zhang terrorized the border regions of Shandong and Jiangsu, leading over ten thousand men, causing havoc for nearly twenty years. Now that he has been captured, he is attracting great attention. Recently, our reporter paid a special visit to the headquarters of the Special Detective Brigade to interview the bandit Zhang and inquire about everything. The Detective Brigade brought Zhang to the room to meet the reporter. Zhang is not very fat, only of medium build, with a refined appearance, dark complexion, and a short, bristly beard. It is fitting that he is known as Black Face. He wore a light gray short coat, stained with oil, with blue cloth trousers, gray socks, and blue cloth shoes. He was in good spirits and looked amiable, but his eyes flashed with ferocity. He spoke with a Jiaxiang (Shandong Province) accent, with slight Jiangsu and Anhui tones. He talked and laughed freely, as if unaware that he was a prisoner. The reporter invited him to sit down and asked about his past as a bandit and his current thoughts. Zhang spoke freely about the past, saying that he had been a bandit for nearly twenty years, money came like water, and he squandered it like dirt. He had been a highwayman for half his life and had no savings. His eighty-year-old father had no means of support, which he deeply lamented. Zhang also stated that he was currently forty-six years old, from Dongzhuang Village, sixty-five li north of Yixian County (now part of Tengzhou), Shandong Province. His ancestors were farmers and originally good, honest people. He still has an elderly father, Zhang Yunrang, who is eighty-two years old, living in Peikou. He has one wife and three daughters, living in XInji, Lingbi County, Anhui Province. His original name was Zhang Jiadong, also known as Zhang Jiansheng. After becoming a bandit, he was called Zhang Black Face because of his dark complexion. The nickname became well-known in the underworld, and his real name was forgotten. In the seventh year of the Republic (1918), he lived in Dongzhuang Village, Yixian County. He had an older brother, Zhang Jiayi, who served as a soldier under Zhang Xun in the Dingwu Army. When he returned home to visit his family, it happened that his cousin, Zhang Kaikin, was murdered. The county authorities accused his brother of the murder, arrested him, and imprisoned him, where he died of cold and starvation. Feeling deeply aggrieved and impoverished, he joined Wang Yutang, a bandit leader from Gaozhuang, Yixian County. Soon after, the Lincheng train robbery occurred, and Sun Meiyao was appointed to recruit new troops. At that time, Zhang already led seven or eight hundred bandits. Knowing that recruitment was unreliable, he did not participate. Soon after, Sun Meiyao was executed, and the remnants of his band scattered. Zhang took the opportunity to recruit his old subordinates. At this time, Liu Heiqi also rose as a bandit. Zhang and Liu were on par with each other, and there was talk of the "Two Blacks of Southern Shandong." Not long after, Wang Yutang died of illness, and Zhang's forces grew even larger, numbering seven or eight thousand, even ten thousand men, terrorizing the border regions of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Zhang's fifth brother, Zhang Jiade, nicknamed Manbazi, was the most ferocious bandit under Zhang's command, having led troops to capture cities such as Ju County and Yishui County. Later, Liu Guitang repeatedly offered recruitment, but Zhang never participated. During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, Zhang's troops remained in the mountains. In the twenty-first year (1932), Chairman Han (Fuju) recruited Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng, Yin Shigui, and Yin Shishan, gathering them at Dawenkou, living in Gaotang. Xia Ziming and others went to the mountains to offer recruitment to Zhang's troops, which at that time numbered about seven or eight thousand men. They gathered at Dongguozhuang, more than twenty li east of Teng County. First, seven or eight hundred men boarded trains to advance north, but when they arrived at Xiache Station, they heard that Liu Guitang had fled from Gaotang, so they also got off the train midway and fled into the Mengshan and Culaishan mountains, scattering their weapons. Zhang also stated that the most notorious bandits under his command were all his adopted sons, including Li Doujin, Li Douyin, Mao Xuetian, Sun Yewen, Li Yingxiang, Song Guixin, Xu Yude, and thirty others, who were the most famous. Li Doujin and Li Douyin were brothers, leading over a thousand bandits. Mao Xuetian led over a thousand bandits. Sun Yewen led several hundred bandits. Li Yingxiang led over a hundred bandits. Song Guixin led seven or eight hundred bandits. Xu Yude led over two thousand bandits. The rest each led several hundred to a thousand men. Most have died, scattered, or fled. The Li brothers are already dead, leaving only Mao Xuetian, who still leads two or three hundred men, in the border areas of Jiangsu. However, in southern Shandong, Teng County, Yixian County, Linyi, Yicheng, Fei County, Ju County, and Rizhao, those who act as bandits are all under Zhang Shaoqian and no others. Zhang finally said that after leaving Shandong, he lived in Xinmaqiao, north of Zaozhuang. Unexpectedly, his luck had waned, and he was captured and brought here. Although he had been a bandit for nearly twenty years and had seen a lot of money, he had given it all to friends and had no savings. His eighty-two-year-old father had no means of support. If Chairman Han would show kindness and give him a chance to reform, he could gather two or three hundred of his old subordinates to serve the local area, ensuring peace and tranquility in the Teng, Yi, Lin, Fei, Ju, and Ri areas, eliminating banditry, and so on.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 5th, Provincial Chairman Han Fuju personally interrogated Zhang Black Face, Sun Yewen, Liu Yuzhen, and others in his office. Liu Yaoting, the captain of the Special Detective Brigade, transported the three bandits from the brigade headquarters to the Provincial Government by car to await interrogation. Han first interrogated Zhang Black Face. Upon seeing Han, Zhang immediately asked, "Is this the Governor?" Han slightly nodded his head. Zhang then said, "I really feel sorry for having disappointed the Governor with the previous recruitment." Han said, "That is in the past, it is nothing." Han slowly asked how many years he had been a leader. Zhang confessed, "I have been in charge for about seventeen or eighteen years." Han asked, "Have you accumulated any savings from being a bandit for so many years?" Zhang confessed, "Since I became a bandit, I have received no less than several hundred thousand dollars, but I have always been fond of making friends and spent it all. I have no savings now." Han then asked, "Are there still people in your family?" Zhang confessed, "I still have an elderly father, a wife, and three daughters." At this point, Han ordered them to be taken down to rest. He then interrogated Sun Yewen. Han asked how many years he had been a bandit. Sun confessed that he had been a bandit since the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), which is already more than ten years. Finally, he asked Liu Yuzhen how many years he had been a bandit. Liu confessed that he had been a leader since the seventh year of the Republic (1918), which is already seventeen or eighteen years. During the Northern Expedition of the Central Army, he was once recruited by the Central Army and served as a battalion commander, regimental commander, clan leader, and other positions, and had led troops to capture counties such as Yishui. Han ordered them all to be taken down. Han, considering that all the bandits had committed heinous crimes, sentenced them all to death, specifying that they would be executed by firing squad at 7:00 AM on the 6th. However, Han also believed that although Zhang Black Face and others were bandits, they were generous by nature and worthy of being considered heroes. However, due to the law of the land, they could not be spared. He specially ordered that thick coffins be prepared for their bodies, and that they be buried in deep pits. He also ordered that Zhang be informed before the execution so that he would know. He further ordered that Shi Jingzhou, the director of the Military Law Department, and Liu Yaoting, the commander of the Special Detective Brigade, be responsible for handling the matter. At 7:00 AM on the 6th, before the bandits were executed by firing squad, it was feared that since Zhang and others had been rampant for many years and had many followers, unexpected incidents might occur. Therefore, soldiers from the pistol brigade and enforcers from the Military Law Department, a total of forty men, were dispatched to guard everything. Military judges Qiao Langting, Zhang Qiao, Yang Jinqing, and Deputy Commander Feng Xiuan of the Special Task Force were appointed as execution supervisors. At 7:30 AM on the 6th, the execution supervisors and troops arrived at the Public Security Bureau and brought out the three bandits, Zhang Black Face, Sun Yewen, and Liu Yuzhen. After a brief interrogation, the bandits were tied up and put into cars, riding in three cars in total. The first car carried soldiers from the pistol brigade, the second car carried the bandits, and the third car carried the execution supervisors. They left the Public Security Bureau and headed to the Houjia Dayuan execution ground on Weiba Road. Upon arriving at Houjia Dayuan, troops had already been stationed around the area to provide security. The three bandits were then ordered to kneel facing south. Zhang Black Face was on the east side, Sun Yewen was on the west side, and Liu Yuzhen was in the center. Their identities were verified at the same time, and they were executed by firing squad simultaneously. The bandits all faced their execution generously, without saying a word. Zhang and Liu were each shot twice, and Sun was shot once. The executions were completed by 8:30 AM. The government provided coffins for their bodies and buried them, and also telegraphed their families to come and claim the bodies. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Songjiang: Road Construction Cuts Off Water Supply, Farmers Appeal <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Since automobiles have been travelling on the Songwei County Road, transportation has been very convenient. Recently, the expansion of the Songjiang to Sijing County Road began with contracting out the construction of culverts and road surfaces and has already begun work. It is expected that it will be open to traffic in mid-June, and transportation in Songyi will become even more convenient in the future. However, the farmland in Shijiutu and Baiwo Township, including the 18th Tu, 10th Gang, and 11th Tu, is divided into two parts by the road. The originally planned number of culverts is insufficient, and it is feared that the fields traversed by the road will not have enough water for irrigation and will become barren. It is difficult to irrigate them by detouring to scoop water, and it is unbearable to watch them become barren. Therefore, the township chief Chen Liuzhang and landowners Wang Zhilin, Yu Zhongchi, Yang Tianjue, and others have successively petitioned the district office to forward their request to the county government, which is in charge of the road project, for prompt relief. The acting district chief Lu Dai believes that the farmland in that area is within the scope of the road construction and that the tenants have suffered losses. The addition of water pipes to connect the farmland irrigation is indeed an essential plan.

Before long, the workers in the fine yarn department also rose up in response. The yarn factory employees all fled. The workers also poured out of the factory, gathered in the trade union for a meeting, and then returned to the factory, demanding that the factory restore the reduced wages to their previous levels. At that time, the order was chaotic. The factory's workshop, general affairs office, security department, test and examination department, and dormitories were destroyed. At that time, the county party department, public security bureau, and security team received the news one after another, and sent personnel to the scene to suppress and persuade the workers to resume work first.

After going to Hangzhou on the morning of the 9th as scheduled, they are expected to return to Shanghai around the 20th and then go to Nanjing for inspection.</p>

<p>Regarding the 5 million yuan credit guarantee loan to rescue industry and commerce, after Minister Kong of Finance decided on the measures, the Money Industry Association held a summer meeting of managers of each firm yesterday. The Bankers Association tried its best to persuade acceptance. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Bankers Association Re-Urges Acceptance</p>
<p>Of the 5 million yuan credit guarantee loan, the Central Bank and the Bank of China each undertook 1 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications undertook 500,000 yuan, all of which have been complied with. The Bankers Association undertook 1.5 million yuan. In addition to doubling the amount originally accepted by member banks, the Secretary-General Lin Kanghou has again urged member banks and non-member banks to accept the deficit. At the same time, member banks that have already accepted the amount have been notified to first send the doubled amount to the Bank of China for collection in order to implement the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Money Industry Resolves Not to Increase</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association held a summer meeting of managers of each firm at 3:00 PM yesterday. 55 managers, including Pei Yunqing, Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, and Qian Yuansheng, from 55 firms, including Fuyuan, Dade, Baofeng, Hengxun, Chunyuan, Yida, and Dunyu, attended. Chairman Qin Runqing reported on the industrial and commercial credit guarantee loan case and the Ministry of Finance's intention to increase the amount to 1 million yuan. A public resolution was requested. However, the public opinion was that each firm's credit loans to various industries, such as a fixed-term and current account of 300,000 yuan each, totaled over 30 million yuan for 55 firms, which is slightly different from the banking industry. It was advocated that there was no need to increase the amount again and that it should remain the same as the previous resolution, joining with 250,000 yuan to express sympathy. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e124">This Year's International Labor Conference: Our Side Prepares Important Proposals; Various Groups Host Farewell Banquets for Delegates Leaving the Country <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the delegates attending this year's International Labor Conference are scheduled to depart on the 10th, and various parties are currently hosting farewells. A Central News Agency reporter learned that our side's proposals for this conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Restricting Dumping to Save Decline</p>
<p>The most important proposal prepared by our side this time is regarding the policy of dumping. In recent times, various countries in the world have been increasing the production of goods as much as possible, reducing the cost of goods on one hand, and dumping them abroad on the other. This policy is detrimental to the domestic labor force, as it reduces wages and increases working hours. Furthermore, the result of their dumping has further caused our country to fall into a state of industrial and commercial recession and increased unemployment. This proposal will request the conference to formulate restrictions on dumping policies. In addition, the issue of factory inspections in the concessions will also be submitted to the International Labor Organization authorities for early implementation.</p>
<p>Selling Chinese Laborers is Inhumane</p>
<p>Youth unemployment has become a serious problem in our country. This time, some statistics on this issue have been collected and prepared to be submitted to the conference to request the deliberation of relief measures. Many Chinese laborers have been sold to Nanyang and other places as coolies. Treating people as livestock is truly inhumane and will also be raised. The proposal on equal treatment for colored laborers, which was proposed by our country's delegate Ma Chaojun at the previous conference, will be further elaborated. The above proposals may have some difficulties in implementation, but for the sake of the interests of our country's labor force, it is said that the delegates will still work hard to coordinate.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Groups Hosted Farewell Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Labor Association, and the Shanghai Wharf Business Office, three groups, held a farewell banquet at 7:00 PM yesterday on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for the labor and management representatives from our country attending the 19th International Labor Conference. Mr. Wang Jinxia, the labor representative from our country, and Mr. Wang Zhisheng, the management representative, attended, as well as Zhu Xuefan, He Haifeng, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Shusheng, Zhang Xiaotong, and more than 30 others. Labor advisor Wu Wentian, Secretary Zhang Daoming, management advisor Gu Bingyuan, and Secretary Zhang Hualian were also invited. During the banquet, Zhu Xuefan, publicly recommended by the three groups, delivered a farewell speech, the general idea being to hope that our labor representative would uphold the principle of labor-management coordination, seek welfare for our country's workers, and wish this trip success. The two representatives then delivered thank-you speeches, and at the same time, the attending personnel from both sides exchanged opinions until the meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Chinese National Federation of Industries also held a farewell banquet at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road at 7:00 PM yesterday afternoon to see off the representatives from our country attending the 19th International Labor Conference. Those who attended included representative Wang Zhisheng, advisor Gu Bingyuan, Secretary Zhang Hualian, labor representative Wang Jinxia, advisor Wu Wentian, Secretary Zhang Daoming, Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Gu Huaibing, Guo Shun of the National Federation of Industries, Nie Lusheng, Hu Xiyuan, Wu Yun Chu, Qian Chengxu, and more than 20 others. Lin Kanghou and Guo Shun delivered farewell speeches, and Wang Zhisheng and Wang Jinxia delivered thank-you speeches. They enjoyed themselves until 9:00 PM and then said goodbye. The International Labor Organization Association is scheduled to hold a banquet at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road at noon today to entertain our country's employer and labor representatives attending this year's International Labor Conference. Lang Xingshi, Wu Qingtai, He Haifeng, and Yang Youren will chair the meeting, and celebrities from all walks of life, including Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Tong Hangbai, Guo Shun, Lin Kanghou, Qian Chengxu, Yu Zuoting, and Du Yuesheng, have been invited to accompany them. The association also sent letters to all members in advance, stating that the representatives are scheduled to depart on May 10th. In order to connect feelings and assist in preparations, this association is scheduled to hold a farewell banquet at the Yiyou Society at noon on the 9th. At the same time, the first annual meeting will be held to discuss all association affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Foreign Merchants Offering Small Life Insurance Policies: Government to Ban Them <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate the general working class, has planned to offer simple life insurance, which has been approved by the Legislative Yuan and is scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. However, foreign merchants have recently imitated this, which is in conflict with our country's laws. According to sources in the Postal Savings Bureau yesterday, it was reported the other day that the American-registered American Foreign Life Insurance Company recently founded small life insurance by Yang Shupai, which is quite similar to the simple life insurance founded by the Postal Savings Bureau. Simple life insurance is life insurance. In European and American countries, it is called industrial life insurance because its wages are paid weekly and its premiums are also paid weekly. The purpose of the simple life insurance offered by the Postal Savings Bureau this time is to seek the interests of the people, not to make profits. It has been approved by the Legislative Yuan and is scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. Last month, the Legislative Yuan passed the Simple Life Insurance Law, the first article of which stipulates that simple life insurance is a state-run enterprise, and other insurance companies may not operate it. That is, no company may operate small insurance policies below 500 yuan, which is very clear. The small life insurance offered by the foreign merchant American Foreign Company is quite in conflict with the law passed by the Legislative Yuan. In order to maintain state-run enterprises and the solemnity of the law, the government will ban it.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegrahs the Ministry of Finance Requesting Increased Import Taxes on Foreign Goods <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Should Ensure That the Sales Price of Foreign Goods That Can Be Replaced by Domestic Goods Does Not Decrease to Below the Sales Price of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the proposal of Executive Committee member Hu Xiguo, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday to increase import taxes on foreign goods that can be replaced by domestic goods: "Ministry of Finance: In recent times, the trend of the world economy has shifted from tariff wars to trade management. Under this import quota, it is equivalent to the elimination of imports, and on the other hand, the policy of reducing currency values and abolishing the gold standard is used to create an unprecedentedly cheap record for foreign exports in order to occupy other people's markets. Unfortunately, our country is caught in the middle of these two major policies. Over the past decades, the gradually created modern industry will be completely submerged by this frenzy. Anyone who is familiar with domestic and foreign business conditions has this feeling. If the current tariff policy is not changed and all foreign goods that can be replaced by domestic goods are subject to increased import taxes so that their sales price does not decrease to below the sales price of domestic goods, then the existing factories in the country will have no chance of revival. This matter is even more fundamental and essential than providing loans for relief. Only hope that your ministry will resolutely preside over and approve the requested handling. It would be the great fortune of the industrial community. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, respectfully. Yang."</p>

<h3 id="e130">Certificates Required for Goods Shipped to Belgium <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Belgian Consul General in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating that goods shipped to Belgium and the Luxembourg Economic Union must have a certificate of origin and a visa from the resident consul. The regulations regarding consular visas are hereby copied for your review, but Section 1 of the regulations requires the most attention, because many goods from your country sold to our federation often violate the regulations and do not have a consular identity certificate, and most of these goods are transshipped through a certain port in Europe. Correspondingly, I hereby request that you check and inform the relevant trade associations. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has already informed the relevant trade associations.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Court Explaining: Delivery Receipts Do Not Need Stamps <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to clarify that delivery receipts are not merchandise vouchers issued by shops, and therefore, according to the provisional regulations, do not require stamp duty, specifically sent letters to the Shanghai Local Court and the Second Branch of the Higher Court for explanation. The two letters are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Local Court</p>
<p>In direct reply: We received your letter of the 7th of this month, forwarding the ministry order to temporarily suspend stamp duty on delivery receipts for reference. Upon investigation, Article 2, Category 1 of the current Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations only stipulates stamp duty for cash receipts, and does not stipulate stamp duty for merchandise receipts. Therefore, such documents have never been affixed with stamps, and there has never been any penalty for violating the regulations. Last year, the Legislative Yuan deliberated and the government promulgated the Stamp Tax Law on December 8, which included both cash and merchandise receipts, stipulating that both should be stamped. In fact, the law has not yet reached its effective date and has not yet come into force. However, general enforcement personnel misunderstood the intention of the law and frequently sent such cases for penalties. In order to avoid misunderstandings by public officials, our Chamber presented a request to the Ministry of Finance and received the above-mentioned instruction. The so-called temporary suspension of stamp duty is because once the Stamp Tax Law is implemented, merchandise receipts will naturally require stamps. Because the time is very short, the word "temporary" is used to distinguish it. Following the previous letter, we enclose a copy of the Ministry's instruction and briefly describe the background of this matter. We request your court to take note.</p>
<p>Letter to the First Branch Court</p>
<p>In direct reply: On the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Color Printing Industry Association stating that on the 4th of this month, member Heji Printing Company reported that in February, the Public Works Bureau, following an order from the Special District Court, came to inspect account books and vouchers to see if any stamp duty had been omitted. As a result, 104 delivery receipts from Zhu Hongji and Heji were taken away, and 8 unused ones were recorded. Subsequently, the court imposed a fine of 1,100 yuan on the 15th of the month. Upon investigation, these delivery receipts were in triplicate form. The first copy was the delivery note, given to the customer, and was stamped. The second copy was the receipt, which the customer stamped and returned as proof of receipt of the goods. The third copy was the stub. Upon investigation, the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations do not specify any stamp duty for delivery receipts, and the Ministry of Finance has a clear order to temporarily suspend stamp duty, so there is no need to affix stamps. Therefore, an appeal was filed according to law. Subsequently, on April 8, an appeal ruling was issued, stating that the second copy of the receipt is a merchandise voucher issued by a shop as described in Category 1, Item 8 of the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations, and is also a voucher that should be stamped. Except for the 8 unused receipts that were exempted from penalty, the remaining 104 receipts were still subject to a fine of 1,040 yuan. According to the regulations, a merchandise voucher issued by a shop is issued when a customer purchases goods but does not take them immediately. The shop then issues a merchandise storage voucher so that the customer can pick up the goods later with the voucher. This is completely different from the nature of a delivery receipt, which is a merchandise receipt. Moreover, the phrase "issued by a shop" in the case of a merchandise voucher issued by a shop clearly means that the voucher should be held by the recipient as proof. As for the delivery receipt, it is still collected by the shipping shop as proof that the customer has received the goods. The two cannot be compared at all, which is very obvious. The court is not familiar with business practices and misinterprets these provisions, which is a mistake. Although the appeal ruling is wrong, the merchant's suffering has no way to be addressed. The current state of commerce is such that even with year-round operations, it is difficult to obtain even a small profit. Now, because the court misquotes the provisions, the merchant is suffering and has no way to appeal. Is this the intent of the legislation? As a last resort, we specially send this letter to you, urging you to forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to seek relief, and send separate letters to the court and the tax bureau, to understand the difficulties of businesses and to allow for correction. Based on this, it is found that the receipt used by Zhu Hongji, which is Heji, is in triplicate form. The first copy is the delivery note, given to the customer, and has already been stamped. The second copy is the receipt, which the customer stamps and returns. Since it is a merchandise receipt, according to the current Stamp Tax Regulations, there is no explicit provision for it, so it can be temporarily exempted from stamp duty, and it is absolutely different from the merchandise voucher issued by a shop as described in Category 1, Item 8 of the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations. The statement in the letter from Heji Printing Company, which is Zhu Hongji, is very clear. Accordingly, we report the situation truthfully, urging your association to seek relief, and send a letter to the court and the tax bureau, allowing for correction, which is fair. Upon investigation, a merchandise voucher issued by a shop is received by the customer for future pick-up from the shop, such as deposit slips, reservation slips issued by bookstores, dyeing slips issued by dyeing shops, and receipts issued to customers by photo studios and clock repair shops. All of these belong to this category. As for the delivery receipt, it is a receipt that the customer should issue to the shop after receiving the goods. The main party is the customer, not the shop, and what matters is the customer's stamp. Otherwise, it is just a blank receipt pre-printed by the shop for the customer, which has no evidentiary effect on the voucher. Based on this, it is absolutely not considered a merchandise voucher issued by the shop. Therefore, there has always been an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that it is a merchandise receipt, which is not specified in the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations and does not require stamp duty. However, although this case has already gone through appeal procedures and there is no way to obtain further relief, the issue concerns the standard for stamp duty penalties. For the sake of future remedies, we accordingly send this letter to your court, asking you to pay attention to it and hoping that your court can investigate such cases with the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Bureau at any time, which would greatly benefit businesses. To the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court.</p>
<h3 id="e132">People from All Regions Eagerly Join the Aviation Association <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai City Recruitment Team Office of the China Aviation Association directly recruited members, people from provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as cities and counties, have been eagerly requesting to join as members, with more than a dozen requests arriving daily. Some have asked for various recruitment documents to be sent to them to help with introductions, showing the enthusiastic support of people from all regions for the aviation-national salvation movement. In Shanghai, people from military, commercial, industrial, and academic circles have been particularly enthusiastic about joining. It is reported that yesterday, Li Chengxu from the Shanghai Arsenal Storage Department joined as a special member, and Wang Dongliang and more than a dozen others joined as ordinary members, personally delivering their membership applications and fees to the office for tallying.</p>
<p>The Team Office received 300 yuan in fees from Team Leader Wu Qiding of Team 161, 200 yuan in the third installment of fees and donations from Team Leader Jin Liren of Team 152, and 800 yuan in fees from Team Leader Wu Kaixian of Team 46. It is said that the above achievements were all due to the efforts of Zhou Guangrong, a director of the Water and Electricity Industry Union in one of the team's districts. Mr. Zhou's enthusiasm and efforts are admirable, and he is still continuing his work. Also, Tao Guangchuan, the leader of Team 325, requested that Song Qiyuan and Sun Letao be added as deputy team leaders. The office has already issued appointment letters to them, requesting their efforts to assist in the work.</p>

<h3 id="e134">National Seamen's Special Party Department Conference Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The conference of responsible persons from all seamen's district party departments nationwide, convened by the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen, discussed many important issues in the previous two days, including urgently requesting the authorities to recover navigation rights. Yesterday was the closing day of the conference. Executive Committee member Yang Hu and others held a closing ceremony in the assembly hall of the association, and also hosted a banquet for the representatives from each district. Committee member Yang Hu chaired the meeting, and Li Jianbai served as the recorder. After the ceremonial proceedings, Committee member Yang Hu delivered an instruction speech, and Secretary Chen Songping gave a speech. Representatives from the Wuhu district, Tong Daosheng, and representatives from the Fuzhou district, Qi Baoxiang, gave responses. Afterwards, a banquet was held. During the banquet, the guests and hosts toasted each other, making it a grand occasion. Around 4 PM, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The instruction speech of Committee member Yang Hu of the association is recorded below. Comrades, representatives, regarding the conference of responsible persons of the lower-level party departments convened by our association recently, I was unable to attend the opening ceremony because I had just returned to Shanghai from Beijing and was limited by time. I am very sorry, but I am very happy to be able to meet with all of you comrades at this closing ceremony. We know that the significance of convening this conference by our association is, on the one hand, to make a general report and a general review of our past work, to serve as an observation and a lesson. Furthermore, comrades, the difficulties or questions you feel in various places can all be brought here for resolution. On the other hand, we want to use this meeting to determine our future work policies and to give us some warnings and excitement, and to advance the seamen's party work on a bright path. We now hope that through the efforts of all of you comrades after this meeting, we can achieve this goal. But now I still have two points of view that I hope all of you comrades will do. First, we must tighten the organization of the party. The Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen has only been established for more than two years. The history is short, and the work is complicated. In the future, I hope that everyone will tighten up the organization of the lower-level party departments of the seamen, making them as solid as iron, so that they can become a vital force in the revival of the nation. Second, we must step up the training of seamen. In the past, seamen were limited by economics and could not get a good education from the country. In the future, all of you comrades must work hard to train them, so that they can become a healthy citizen in private and a warrior who defends the nation in public. Comrades, the international situation is urgent, and the Third World War is about to break out in an instant. We are responsible for the seamen’s wartime transportation and reconnaissance responsibilities. The responsibility is very heavy. We must be able to mobilize the entire population in wartime. We must work hard during peacetime. I hope that all of you will return to your districts and work hard, so that you will not fail the party and the country, and serve the country. Today I can’t talk much because of something. Finally, I wish you all hard work, finished.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Pudong Public Office Letter States Opinions on Dismantling Dongjiadu Wooden Wharf <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Public Office raised funds to build a public cement wharf at Dongjiadu, and two public wooden wharves on either side. Since the Public Utilities Bureau borrowed it to set up the Shipping Affairs Office and the Shipping Donation Office, and the long-distance bus Liuliqiao ferry occupied the public wooden wharf on the south side, only the public wooden wharf on the north side was used for the berthing of ships from Pudong West, passenger ships, and cargo ships. Now the Public Utilities Bureau mistakenly intends to dismantle this public wooden wharf. The Pudong Public Office has sent a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau, asking it to consider the convenience of merchants and people coming and going to load and unload goods, and to avoid dismantling it for the convenience of transportation. The letter draft is recorded below. Dear Sirs, according to the report of Xi Amao and others from Dongjiadu, the wharf management office inspector ordered the demolition of the reed mat shed on the north public wooden wharf of the Dongjiadu cement public wharf on the 5th of this month. The reed mat shed has been demolished on the 7th. They also ordered the demolition of the public wooden wharf within three days. Upon investigation, this public wooden wharf was built by the Pudong Public Office through fundraising. Since the cement public wharf was used by the Public Utilities Bureau to set up the Shipping Affairs Office, the Finance Bureau to set up the Shipping Donation Office, and the South Public Wooden Wharf was used by the South Long-Distance Bus Liuliqiao ferry for berthing, this North Public Wooden Wharf is the only one relied upon by ships from Zhoupu Zhangjiang Zha Xian Nantai and other townships, as well as passenger ships, civilian ships, and cargo ships from various towns in Pudong West for loading and unloading. It is impossible to do without a wharf for even a moment. Inspector Tang did not understand that the reed mat shed was to shelter merchants and people from the wind and rain, and suddenly ordered its demolition, which was already very painful. If he wants to demolish the wharf again, there must be a temporary wharf before people can come and go to load and unload. Moreover, this public wooden wharf was built by the Public Office, and Amao is not in a position to demolish it on its behalf. For this reason, we are reporting to the Public Office. According to this, if the demolition is carried out, a temporary wharf should be built first to avoid obstructing transportation, which is indeed the case. If a temporary wharf cannot be built first, and it hinders dredging of the Pu River, we ask that you comply with the will of the people and consider the demolition so that ships can still come and go to load and unload. For the sake of inter-agency harmony, we still request a reply. To the Wharf and Warehouse Management Office of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, Pudong Public Office, May 8.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Yongxing Money Exchange Case: Court Orders Withdrawal of Criminal Lawsuit <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yongxing Money Exchange at No. 11 Xingren Lane, Lane 120, Ningbo Road, declared bankruptcy on October 20 due to unsustainable real estate business. Lawyers were appointed for liquidation. Xu Baolin, manager of the Tianjin Yujin Bank Shanghai Branch at No. 266 Yongheng Building, Ningbo Road, deposited more than 16,700 yuan into the exchange on April 18 and 19. However, the exchange declared bankruptcy on the 20th. He believed that the exchange knew it could not sustain itself and still accepted deposits, which constituted fraudulent misappropriation. Therefore, he hired lawyer Zhang Deqin to file a criminal lawsuit against the exchange's manager Chen Jingtao, assistant manager Wang Hanqing, shareholders Chen Meibai, Chen Zhongchi, Guo Ruoyu, Chen Dizhou, and six others at the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, First Special Court Judge Xiang Yinghua summoned them in the Second Criminal Court. In addition to Chen Jingtao, who appeared in person, none of the other defendants appeared. Lawyer Xu Zuyan was appointed to appear in court as their representative. Xu Baolin first stated, "I paid in more than 16,700 yuan in drafts on the 18th and 19th, and Yongxing closed down on the 20th. The defendants knew that it would close down on the 20th, so they should not have accepted my money on the 19th. Therefore, their actions did constitute fraud." Chen Jingtao stated in his defense that he had a good relationship with the plaintiff, and there were frequent dealings between them, with mutual deposits and debts. This closure was simply because the exchange invested in many real estate businesses. When it needed funds, it could not pledge them, resulting in unsustainable turnover, and therefore, it was forced to close down. As for the plaintiff's charges, it was entirely a civil dispute, which could be pursued in the civil court. After Judge Xiang's investigation, he ordered the plaintiff to withdraw the criminal lawsuit and file a civil lawsuit instead. Xu Baolin agreed and declared that he would withdraw the complaint. Judge Xiang ruled that the court would not accept the case.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Military Officer Accused by Concubine, Requests Withdrawal After Trial Begins <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Deng Jianhao, a former high-ranking military officer, when stationed in Hubei in previous years, often took advantage of his spare time from military affairs to dress casually and visit Wuhan. He fulfilled his wish of offering a jade pendant, taking Liu Meiying as a concubine. At that time, Liu was only fifteen years old, beautiful both inside and out. Deng favored her greatly, so wherever his banner pointed, whether south or north, he would take this "Madam" with him. It wasn't until March of the year before last that they moved to Shanghai together, building a golden house to hide her beauty. Soon, Deng also abandoned his military life to enjoy the pleasures of the boudoir. Unexpectedly, things changed, and Deng was suddenly accused in court for some reason. However, he dared not appear in court to confront the accuser. Recently, he vacated the rented residence and secretly took his beloved concubine to room 429 of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road, hoping to evade legal sanctions. But from then on, he could not help but vent his anger on Liu, starting with daily quarrels, followed by him leaving alone, abandoning her and treating her like a stranger. Now, Liu Meiying, abandoned for so long and with her livelihood dwindling, had to seek a legal solution to avoid destitution. She hired lawyer Fan Gang and filed a criminal self-accusation against Deng Jianhao with the First Special District Court, requesting an investigation. The court, based on the complaint, issued a summons and ordered it to be served at the Nanjing Hotel. However, he had long left the residence, so when the trial date arrived yesterday afternoon, the defendant could not be summoned. The plaintiff also submitted a request to withdraw the charges, reportedly because Deng had attempted to reconcile with the plaintiff after being accused, hence Liu's request. Judge Yang, considering that the plaintiff had requested the dismissal, ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>

Recently, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. Judge Yu, along with Judges Xiao and Wu, reheard Shen's case.

<p>Local kidnapper Zheng Tangsheng, a notorious criminal who committed a series of kidnappings in Shanghai, including those of Huang Yuyi of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe of the Siming Bank, and Huang Baohua, a paint merchant, fled to Tianjin. In July of the year before last, the French police sent detectives to Tianjin, arrested him, brought him back to Shanghai, and sent him to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. At the conclusion of the trial, he was sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely. The criminal, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. The case was sent back to the Second Special Court for retrial. On the twelfth of last month, the final judgment was announced, upholding the original sentence. He is currently being detained in the detention center, awaiting the Second Special Court to report to the High Third Branch for submission to the Provincial Government for review and approval for execution. However, before the conclusion of the original trial and before the judgment, while detained in the police station, the criminal, out of fear of punishment, once attempted suicide by hanging, but was discovered and saved. After the verdict, during the retrial period, while detained in the detention center, he colluded with a guard to write a letter to his friend, plotting to escape from prison. This was discovered by the French police, and the plan failed. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Zheng, while detained in the Second Special Court detention center, again, out of fear of punishment, took advantage of the quietness in the detention center yesterday morning to secretly swallow poison and commit suicide. The guards discovered this and reported it to the director and warden, who urgently summoned a doctor to the detention center to provide medical assistance. At 10:30 AM, the criminal was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a Xiang Sheng Motor Company car hired by the detention center. When the criminal was helped into the car by the detention center staff and guards, he was already unconscious. It is believed that he had taken a severe dose of poison, and it is uncertain whether he can be saved. Further inquiries will be made and reported later. Meanwhile, the warden is investigating the circumstances of the criminal's poisoning and awaiting further instructions.</p>

<p>Last year, there were over 240,000 crates; this year, an increase is expected.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has historically transported large quantities of crated tea produced in the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi annually. This crated tea is specifically supplied for export, with Russia being the largest destination. Due to seasonal factors, this year's new crated tea has been released earlier than usual. It is now known that the first batch of crated tea is being transported by the Huitong Transportation Company and is being reported and loaded in batches from the Zhakou Station to Shanghai. Over the past two days, over 1,780 crates have arrived at the Shanghai South Station, unloaded from the train. These crates are handled by over 20 tea merchants from the mainland, including Yongxingxiang, Cheng Dafeng, Tongxingxiang, Hengtaihe, and Yonghuachang, and are delivered to Shanghai tea merchants such as Yongxinglong, Gong Shengyong, Shenyuan, Zhongxin Chang, Yuanfeng, and Runqianji. After arriving at the station, the crates are transported by the Huayun Company to the Yuanji Foreign Warehouse on the Suzhou Creek in northern Shanghai for storage and then successively declared for export and sold overseas. Last year, the total number of crated tea transported by this railway was over 240,000 crates. It is expected that this year's transportation will increase compared to previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Wuxi Red Pill Case: Principal Offender Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Photo Identifications Confirmed, Wuxi Sends Personnel to Arrest</p>
<p>In September of last year, the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau detected and dismantled a "Red Pill" (amphetamine) manufacturing facility in Shirangjun Alley in the city, seizing red pills and machinery, and arresting five suspects. Under interrogation, they confessed that the principal offender of the facility was Wang Guiqing from Anhui, who had fled. The five suspects were handed over to the military court for punishment according to the law. At the same time, a photograph of Wang Guiqing was obtained, and an arrest warrant was issued. However, after escaping from Wuxi, Wang Guiqing secretly fled to Shanghai, fearing discovery by the authorities. He used the alias Zhang Kexiang, initially staying in hotels, moving frequently, and acting mysteriously. Later, he rented a room in Shanchang Lane on Carter Road, living in seclusion to avoid detection. Until recently, about two weeks ago, Wang, believing that the situation had eased after more than half a year, moved to a pavilion room on the upper floor of No. 36 Hongxiang Lane on Xinzha Road, living alone in seclusion. However, this was discovered by inspectors Ge Xinde and Feng Yimao of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, who reported it to the bureau chief. Two official letters were prepared, one addressed to the Xinzha Police Station and one to the First Special District Court, requesting assistance in the arrest, along with the warrant and Wang's wanted photograph. At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, they traveled to Shanghai by car and submitted the letters to the Xinzha Police Station, stating everything and requesting assistance. The police chief sent detectives Ruan Yao and Xing Lai to arrest Wang Guiqing at the address, seizing a letter and taking him to the police station. Yesterday morning, Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, stating that when the defendant was arrested, he denied being Wang Guiqing and claimed to be Zhang Kexiang. Later, personnel from the Wuxi Public Security Bureau identified the defendant as Wang Guiqing and presented the wanted photograph for verification. A torn letter from an accomplice in Wuxi was also found in the wastepaper basket, asking the defendant for four sums of money. He was taken to the police station, where he admitted that his real name was Wang Guiqing and that Zhang Kexiang was his alias. He also confessed that he was in charge of the Wuxi Red Pill facility and fled to Shanghai after the incident. The Shanghai Municipal Council agreed to the extradition. Subsequently, inspectors Ge Xinde and Feng Yimao of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau submitted official documents, presented evidence, and requested permission to transfer the suspect. The defendant's testimony was evasive. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Yang Zhao ordered that Wang Guiqing be handed over to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau personnel for return to Wuxi for interrogation and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Yu Huogen's Son-Killing Case Prosecuted <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yu Guanhong (also known as Yu Jilin), son of Yu Huogen, a villager at No. 2 Xinzhaizhi, Yujiatang, west of Hongqiao, Shanghai, was addicted to morphine injections and, more recently, to smoking red pills. He was lazy and refused to work, and committed many evils, causing his family to hate him intensely and refuse to share food with him. As a result, he wore tattered clothes and went out to beg during the day, returning home at night to sleep. His father, Yu Huogen, due to his son's unfilial behavior and persistent refusal to change despite repeated admonitions, and his recent descent into begging, which had severely eroded his face, conceived the idea of killing his son. On the night of April 12th of this year, he colluded with his daughter-in-law, Yu Chen (Yu Guanhong's wife), to strangle Huogen to death with a rope. After the incident, the local police station detained Yu Chen, the murderer of her husband, and sent her to the district court for interrogation and detention. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang arrived on the scene to conduct an examination and confirmed that he had been strangled to death, ordering a coffin to be prepared for burial. In fact, the perpetrator was Yu Huogen, who should have been arrested and detained. However, it was discovered that he was suffering from severe dropsy, so he was not detained. At the time, it was ordered that he be handed over to the local security chief for supervision pending further instructions. Details of this were recorded in a previous report. It is now learned that the case has been investigated and confirmed by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, who has filed charges of homicide with the criminal court, requesting a public trial. Yesterday, the presiding judge ordered the security chief of the 28th Bao, 1st Tu, Chen Wentang, to inform Yu Huogen to surrender to the court at the appointed time to await trial.</p>

<p>Deceased Wife Found Innocent, Released</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the death of Shen Jifeng, a rickshaw puller from Yancheng, who lived in a flat adjacent to the Xizhongxing Cotton Mill on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, who allegedly stabbed himself in the chest with a sharp blade due to suspicions of his wife's infidelity, have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that due to time constraints on the day of the incident, Wang Shaoting, the security chief of the Jin Er Tu area, did not report the death for investigation. Therefore, it was not until yesterday morning that a report was submitted to the Shanghai District Court requesting an investigation. At around 5:00 PM, Prosecutor Zhang Zi was dispatched to the scene. He found that the deceased, Shen Jifeng, had indeed died from injuries sustained during his lifetime. A burial permit was issued, instructing the security chief to arrange for the coffin and burial. It is also learned that Shen Qi, the deceased's wife, was sent to the Xinzha Branch Bureau by the Taiyangmiao Police Station. Bureau officer Ouyang Liu took her statement, in which she stated, "My husband drinks several times a day. This morning, he was drunk and said that I had come home too late yesterday (Tuesday) from my mother's house. He scolded me and hit me and wouldn't let me cry. He took a knife to stab me, but I rolled on the ground, and he couldn't stab me. So, he stabbed himself. Many people saw it but couldn't stop him. We don't usually argue much, only once last year," and so on. After reviewing the statement, the interrogating officer reported it to the Inspectorate of the General Bureau for further review after the court's investigation. The investigation was completed yesterday, so the officer ordered that Shen Qi be released and that the details be reported to the General Bureau for record.</p>

Upon receiving the information, Squad Leader Bao Ziying and Chu Jingwu immediately dispatched Deputy Leaders Dong Wenrui and Xie Qihua, and detectives Zhong Da, Mao Gongzhao, Zhang Shuwen, and Zang Nai to intercept the kidnappers. When they reached the Guangzhao Road intersection, the hostage, Xue Da Shizi, had already been taken out by the kidnappers. The female kidnapper had hired a rickshaw and was holding the child, attempting to escape. The detectives, prompted by the informant, approached and apprehended the female kidnapper, recovering the hostage. They noticed several suspicious-looking individuals ahead, who were turning back to look. They sent officers to pursue them. It turned out that those individuals were the kidnappers. Upon seeing the officers pursuing them, they drew guns and fired two shots before scattering and fleeing. The officers escorted the female kidnapper back to the squad and, after a brief interrogation, she admitted to the kidnapping.

<p>A Week of Epidemic Prevention Work</p>
<p>The city's epidemic prevention campaign, which began on May 1st, has already been underway for a week. During this week, the first round of vaccinations in the municipal schools in the southern district of Shanghai has been nearly completed. Work has also begun in the Zhabei area, and both concessions are also proceeding.</p>
<p>North and South Municipalities: The Municipal Health Bureau has nearly completed the first round of vaccinations in the municipal schools in the southern district of Shanghai. In the Zhabei area, several schools have already undergone the first round of vaccinations. A total of 15,819 people have been vaccinated within the week: 11,199 males and 4,620 females. It is expected that the work in the urban area will be completed within the week, and vaccinations will be given in rural schools next week. Work in factories and households will begin next month. So far, no epidemics have been detected this year, and it is expected that this year's epidemic will decrease.</p>
<p>Both Concessions: The first round of vaccinations in both concessions is underway. The Public Concession Health Department has dispatched vaccination teams to various schools for vaccinations. However, the effectiveness of each vaccination only lasts for one month, and the epidemic season will last until September. Therefore, the Epidemic Prevention Committee is expected to instruct the health authorities of the concession to continue with the second round of vaccinations in order to achieve complete success. In the French Concession, the French Concession Health Department and the Municipal Health Bureau are working together, with the Municipal Health Bureau vaccination team vaccinating the municipal schools within the concession, and the concession health department vaccinating the private schools. It is expected that all vaccinations will be completed before the summer vacation. As for slums and factories, they will be assigned after the school vaccination work is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Domestically Made Electric Refrigerators <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Displayed at China National Products Company and Other Stores</p>
<p>Thousands of electric refrigerators are imported into China each year, worth over one million yuan. Most of the refrigerators sold by various foreign firms in Shanghai are American-made, with over a dozen brands. Initially, most of the purchasers were foreigners, but in recent years, an increasing number of Chinese people have been purchasing them. The monthly electricity cost of an electric refrigerator is only three or four yuan, which is not more expensive than using natural or artificial ice. However, the cleanliness, hygiene, convenience, aesthetics, and appropriate temperature control are vastly superior. In this era of global economic recession, various American industries, such as automobile manufacturing, are facing oversupply, but the manufacturing of electric refrigerators is still thriving. Although the use of electric refrigerators in China is limited to urban areas, their popularity has been increasing recently, especially in Shanghai and Nanjing. The Yaguang Manufacturing Company in Shanghai has always been famous in the domestic goods industry for its creation of Bakelite jade products and various electrical appliances. Recently, recognizing the urgent need for self-sufficiency in electric refrigerators, they invested in long-term research and trial manufacturing, and have now completely succeeded. The refrigerator's shell is made entirely of steel, with an enameled interior and a top-quality white paint exterior. The design is very novel, and the interior capacity and shelf area are specially enlarged compared to foreign products to suit Chinese families' needs. There are two models, 5 cubic feet and 6.5 cubic feet. The motor switch is fully automatic and equipped with a temperature controller and an automatic bright lighting system for maximum convenience. Electricity consumption is also very economical. All components have been rigorously tested and are guaranteed to be in perfect working order. The China National Products Company and other major stores in Shanghai are displaying and selling these refrigerators. It is reported that there has been a great deal of interest and purchases in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Mediation of the Case Against Increased Pig Industry Fees by the Four Meat Guilds <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>No Results Due to the Insistent Attitudes of Both Parties, The Entire Fresh Meat Industry Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>More than 1,000 fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai Public Concession have been in dispute for two months due to their opposition to the extra fees charged by the pig industries in Wusong, and the issue remains unresolved. The various fresh meat guilds are deeply concerned that the situation will escalate, so they convened both parties for mediation the day before yesterday. As a result of the insistence of the industry side, the matter was not resolved. The entire fresh meat industry held another meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mediation by the Four Guilds Fails</p>
<p>More than 1,000 fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai Public Concession have been affected by the extra fees charged by the pig industries in Wusong, resulting in difficult operations and unbearable burdens. Therefore, they have risen up in opposition and organized an opposition committee to conduct negotiations. Because the industry side has persisted with its views, no progress has been made, so the dispute remains at a standstill. The various fresh meat guilds are deeply concerned that the situation will escalate, so they convened both parties for mediation at Dunrentang in Nanshi at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 6th). More than ten representatives from both sides attended, including Gu Baoxiang from the pig industry and Chen Longhu and Mao Yicheng from the fresh meat industry. First, Fan Deyu, a representative of the guilds, reported the intention of the mediation and advised both sides to make concessions. Then, the industry representative stood up and briefly stated, "The fees charged by our industry are long-standing precedents of decades and are not newly created. The fresh meat industry's request to abolish them all is difficult to comply with. We can only reduce the warehouse fee and store commission by three cents per pig, and a contract must be signed that there will be no objection forever. All the remaining cannot be changed," etc. The fresh meat industry representative then stated that the warehouse fee, store commission, and foot binding fee charged by the industry are unreasonable. Historical precedents have also changed. The old system of the warlord era should be abolished. Because the opinions of both sides were divergent, the mediation could not be established.</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Held Another Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Because the Wusong pig industries persisted with their opinions, the Public Concession's fresh meat industry specially convened a general meeting of representatives of all businesses at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than thirty representatives from various districts attended, including Ju Zusa, Liu Maofang, Wang Liangbao, Yang Yinyou, Sun Hongyang, Wu Wenguang, Ye Shifan, Qiu Shixian, Chen Longhu, and Huang Qixun. First, Chairman Chen Longhu reported on the mediation process of the guild. Then, the following cases were resolved: (1) The Wusong pig industries are only willing to reduce the warehouse fee and store commission by three cents. Should this be accepted? Resolution: We will not rest until the goal of abolishing all fees is achieved. Otherwise, by the Dragon Boat Festival, starting from the January 28th Shanghai Incident, all the fees charged will be deducted from the industry's account and transactions will be stopped. (2) Our industry admitted in a newspaper advertisement last month that it was 3.2 cents per pig. This was due to a misunderstanding at the time. According to Nanshi, it is only 2.3 cents per pig. It should be notified to the Wusong pig industries to handle it the same way as Nanshi. Resolution: Passed. (3) Notice to the industry. Resolution: The secretariat will be responsible for handling it.</p>

<p>Li Pansheng, a native of Wuxi, was 44 years old this year. He worked as a food delivery worker at the Dalichun Restaurant downstairs in the Great World building on Avenue Muntigny in the French Concession. At 8:00 PM on the 12th of last month, he entered the Shaoxing opera theater on the third floor of the Great World amusement park to collect bowls. He had an argument with the tea house staff. He was immediately twisted and beaten by Huang Rutang (age 27, native of Ningbo), the tea house accountant of the theater, and three or four other people. Li was kicked in the abdomen and died after ineffective treatment. The French Concession police sent Detective Liu Dianlong to arrest Huang Rutang. Regarding the part of the victim's family requesting compensation for damages, the Dalichun Restaurant and the Great World accountant gave consolation to settle the case. Regarding the criminal complaint, the police sent Huang to the Second Special Court to file a public prosecution on the crime of causing death by injury. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has been completed by Judge Sun Penghan of the Second Special Court. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Sun brought the defendant to the court in the First Criminal Court and sentenced Huang Rutang to four years and eight months of imprisonment for causing death by injury. The number of days detained before the verdict is determined will be offset by one day of imprisonment for every two days. During the appeal period, the defendant will be transferred to the detention center to await instructions.</p>

<p>Liu Chunhui, a native of Ningbo who used to run a small cigarette and paper shop on Yangshupu Road, closed the shop due to economic difficulties and inability to maintain his livelihood. He often quarreled with his wife, Fang. In November of last year, Fang ran away from her husband and had an affair with a fellow villager named Bao Caisheng, living together at No. 9 Taopeng Road. Liu also often went there to ask his wife for money. At about 1:00 PM on the 30th of last month, he went again for lunch and drank too much alcohol. He demanded 120 yuan as a complete severance of the marital relationship with his wife. Because he did not get his wish, he was very angry. He grabbed a pair of scissors from the table and stabbed her in the eye. She was injured and screamed for help. Chinese Detective Tang Pengfei and Chinese Police No. 2530 from the Yulin Road Police Station arrived, arrested him, took him to the police station, and sent him to the First Special District Court. Because Fang was not present at the Sacred Heart Hospital, he was ordered to send the defendant back to custody and reschedule the hearing after the victim recovered from her injuries. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that Fang's eye injury had slightly improved and that she was present in court to testify. According to Fang, who claimed to be 28 years old, the defendant intended to use scissors to blind her eye and deliberately inflict such poison. If she went home with him, her life would be in danger, and she requested that the court punish him. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Wu sentenced Liu Chunhui to three months of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the verdict is determined will be offset by one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

<p>Seemed to Be Disappointed in Love</p>
<p>At about 12:00 PM yesterday, a woman who was about 20 years old, wearing a black serge cheongsam and black leather shoes, walked alone to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf on the 16th Pier and boarded a ferry to cross the river. When the ferry reached the middle of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Her body sank and then floated up. Fortunately, she was rescued by the crew. Because she had inhaled a lot of water, she was quickly sent to the police post at the Pudong ferry terminal and taken to the Pudong Branch Bureau. After being given clothes to change into, the bureau questioned her about her name, age, and origin, but the woman refused to tell the truth. As for the reason for her suicide, she was questioned repeatedly, but she did not reveal it, only saying that she had a relative in the city named Chen Shifan, who lived on Connaught Road and had a telephone at home. The bureau immediately called the place, and there was indeed such a person, but he had not yet returned home. A suicide note was found in the woman's wet clothes, addressed to Tiaohua, which roughly said, "Please wash and dress my body yourself, do not let others do it, and do not use a coffin to bury it, throw it into the sea, this is my last request, you must allow me to do this, from now on we will never meet again, I wish you two happiness and take care of your health, of course." Judging from her tone, it seemed that she was disappointed in love. The bureau also asked if she had been married before, and she replied that she had not yet married. She was first sent to Pudong Hospital for treatment, and her relatives would be notified to come to the case for verification.</p>

<p>4.  Future Efforts of the Bank</p>
<p>Due to internal and external difficulties in China's economic affairs, the economic circle and the Bank's efforts to improve the situation have been described above. If we want to see a turnaround from now on, we must make further plans.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country. The way to save the country is to start with agricultural products. As mentioned above, the essence of rescuing the countryside and supporting production, from the bank's point of view, should be to cultivate its germination and support its growth with various financial methods to make its products find their own way out. In other words, it is to increase its production capacity on the one hand, and to guide it closer to consumption on the other hand, reducing various barriers in the middle. The Bank is responsible for developing the industrial mission, and should recognize this key point of effort as a guideline for business operations. The following is a brief description of the Bank's future efforts:</p>
<p>(1) Continue to promote the Bank in the interior. This year, the Bank has established agencies in the Northwest and Guangdong, which are generally arranged. In the future, we will set up important production areas in the interior, along the new railway lines, and along the open roads, and in the areas where the chaos has been settled. Those who have already been developed will be more closely arranged. Those who have not been developed will be divided into sections and managed in order. The advancement procedures and the density of settings are often determined by the needs and decided at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Really seek closer to the production business. In recent years, the production business has been very depressed, but it is indeed gradually approaching the consumer side. From this point on, we will lead the way and give it a real help. The production business will be able to gradually advance. In the future, we plan to rely on various forms of cooperatives for agricultural products, and provide loans for production and sales to the village. For various industries, we plan to provide various working capital financing for those who can absorb large amounts of domestic raw materials. For the handicrafts of daily necessities, we also plan to select types and give appropriate support to save costs and increase production. Often, different sections are determined, types are determined, and the situation is considered and managed in order.</p>
<p>(3) Support export trade. In order to seek a way out for production, we must guide it to get closer to consumption. On the one hand, we propose to use domestic goods, and on the other hand, we support export trade. We want to provide access to market conditions in various places, plan overseas sales, and offer preferential conditions for export. There are many benefits, so hope is far away. In the future, we plan to expand foreign exchange business in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong and Xiamen, and set up agency offices in Europe, America and South American business locations, in order to undertake export negotiations as much as possible and support sales. (4) Increase the number of inland warehouses. This year, the number of warehouses has been increased in the mainland, as mentioned above. In the future, we still plan to closely increase the number of sleeves, Jiang Yi in the increase of agricultural warehouses, and its improvement in construction equipment, back to make various domestic production, it is easy to obtain financial financing, when the water line and the freight three categories, examine the needs of the situation, and plan in order.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Siamese Minister of Education's Sophistry Justifying the Suppression of Chinese Schools <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Pretending Chinese Schools Violated Laws, Cancelled Compulsory Classes; Did Not Accept the Opinions of Overseas Chinese Representatives</p>
<p>The Siamese government's promulgation of harsh laws restricting overseas Chinese education has aroused public outrage, and people are planning ways to deal with it. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation received a telegram from overseas Chinese in Siam yesterday, reporting that the country's Minister of Education, Pak Son Saraban, summoned representatives of Chinese schools and newspapers in Bangkok a few days ago, to sophistically justify the harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Publishing an Absurd Statement</p>
<p>On that day, Siamese Minister of Education Pak Son Saraban, accompanied by Deputy Minister and Secretary Nai Wei Tao, met with the representatives. The Minister spoke first, saying that today, we have invited you here to explain the cancellation of compulsory classes. If we describe it verbally, we are afraid that we will not be able to explain it in detail and that we will easily forget something. Therefore, we have issued an explanatory statement today. The reason why the Ministry of Education cancelled compulsory classes this time... After the Minister finished speaking, he distributed the absurd statement to the representatives (the statement is omitted). After the representatives finished reading the statement, the Minister said that all the reasons and answers for the recall of compulsory classes are recorded in the statement, and you should be able to understand it after reading it. (The public did not open their mouths.) The Minister continued, saying that if you have any questions about the statement, you can speak up. So the representatives asked the following questions:</p>
<p>Pretending to Violate Laws to Recall Chinese Schools</p>
<p>(1) A Catholic priest representing the Rose School asked first, "If the Chinese school is run without error and does not violate any regulations, why did the Ministry order it to be suspended and taken back?" (Note: The Rose School is run by Catholics and specializes in teaching the children of overseas Chinese who believe in the religion.) The headmaster replied (hereinafter referred to as "replied" for short), "It is not a question of whether it is wrong or not. The Ministry of Education wants to promote the realization of the educational purpose stipulated in the Constitution, so it ordered the suspension." (2) The Guangzhao representative asked, "Your Excellency said that the Chinese in Siam and running education have greatly benefited Siam, and Chinese schools have shouldered heavy responsibilities for the Ministry of Education for a long time. Now the Ministry of Education has decided to shoulder this heavy responsibility itself. Is this move by the Ministry of Education intended to abandon Chinese schools after they have achieved success?" Replied, "Of course, it has been prepared clearly." (3) Nai Nong, representative of the Siam News, asked (Note: Nai Nong is a Siamese, the principal of Guangzhao School, and sympathetic to the Chinese), "According to the Constitution, people have the right to enjoy elementary education, so let Chinese schools run themselves, which can serve the Ministry of Education, and the results obtained will be the same. Now the Ministry of Education wants to take it back to run it itself. In my opinion, it seems unnecessary." Replied, "Because Chinese schools have failed to comply, they should be taken back." Nai Nong asked again, "If a school does not comply with the regulations, the Ministry of Education can close it, but is it fair to take back all the schools because a part of them violated the law?" Replied, "If not, how can we know that Chinese schools violate the law privately?"</p>
<p>The Number of Unemployed is Bound to Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Nai Nong asked again, "Can the Ministry of Education send staff to manage it?" Replied, "If it is handled like this, the Ministry of Education must increase the number of posts by three times in order to distribute them to the classrooms of each school for management. This is not reasonable." Nai Nong asked again, "In my opinion, the existing staff is sufficient, and there is no need to increase it. As for the results of the management, the students of each Chinese school can be tested at the end of the year. If the management does not have considerable results, the Ministry of Education can also order it to be suspended." Replied, "The questions you have asked are mostly factual questions. These questions have been answered in detail in the statement. As for the Ministry of Education forcibly suspending and taking back the compulsory classes of each Chinese school, the reason is that the Ministry of Education is responsible for the education of children in each Chinese school. There are (1) those who have not reached the age of compulsion, (2) those who have exceeded the age of compulsion, and (3) those who are within the age of compulsion, which is too burdensome. Moreover, the Ministry of Education only takes back the students who are within the age of compulsion to compulsory schools. For students who have not reached the age of compulsory education and those who have exceeded the age of education, I hope that each Chinese school can work for the Ministry." The representative Ren asked, "If so, most Chinese schools will soon be closed down, and most of the staff will be unemployed, and the number of unemployed will inevitably increase. I hope the Ministry will think carefully about this move, which contradicts the major policy of the People's Party." Replied, "No, what the Ministry of Education has implemented is based on the Constitution, and it will not conflict with the Constitution."</p>
<p>Other Foreign Schools are Not Banned</p>
<p>The representative of the Siam News asked again, "Has any other foreign school been ordered to be cancelled this time?" Replied, "When the time comes, they will be cancelled one after another." The representative asked again, "Is this the time or not? In order to make things wait for their peace, they should be cancelled uniformly." Replied, "If so, I need to have four hands and four heads to do it at the same time. At this time, there is only one hand, so only the easy ones are done." At this point, the representatives believed that the Ministry of Education of Siam was trying to cover up its mistakes and had no sincerity in accepting the opinions of the representatives, so they resigned. It is said that they have prepared a book to refute it.</p>

<p>Despite Stable Foreign Exchange, Optimism Remains Strong, Resulting in Another Increase of 9 Yuan and 9 Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday, breaking through the 800 yuan mark. Optimism remains strong, showing no signs of weakening. Although trading in the market was not particularly busy, demand still exceeded supply, and the market situation was very firm. Without special stimulus, it seems difficult to see a decline before the swap period. Earlier in the day, overseas calls indicated that London rose while New York shrank. However, the large speculators' area was weak, and sentiment was unaffected. In addition, the forward silver price in Montr[ea]l fell by 2 to 3 points. The exchange rate opened higher but closed lower. The price of raw gold in London fell by 5 and a half pence. The preliminary trading opened at 96.7 yuan. The trading surface was narrow, and sellers watched from the sidelines, further breaking through the 800 yuan mark, rising to 034 yuan. Large accounts took advantage of the high price to sell, and soon it retreated back into the 800 yuan mark. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British rate remaining flat and the US rate shrinking. The Customs Gold Unit shrank by 5 li, and the standard gold price retreated to 826 yuan and 1 jiao, even lower. However, the price opened high, remaining stable after opening. Later, due to banks cashing out at a high price, the upward trend was blocked and went downstream. Large accounts came to dump again, and the exchange market also hardened due to the banks' selling pressure, once weakening. The exchange rates announced by HSBC Bank remained flat for the British rate and shrank by 0.0625 for the American rate, and then stabilized. Although buying efforts came into play at a low price, due to the banks still supplying, the fluctuations remained uncertain, but generally there was no special change. The psychology of the industry remained good, with repeated short covering. Later, the exchange market gradually tightened, stimulating buying, and finally broke through the 800 yuan mark. At noon, it was even more firm. The situation in the first half of the day remained healthy, but the swap prices for May and June had already fallen back. Yesterday, the short sellers posted 3 yuan, and today the situation in the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>

Huiyuan Huixiang Tongfeng Changshun Li Houyu sold at a high price, falling to 4 yuan and 1 jiao. Huixiang Huodeceng Bichang sold, rising to 7 yuan and 8 jiao.

Huixiang Dade Cheng Heng Yu Yuanmao Yongfu Xingyong came to buy, rising to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. China came out with 5 yuan worth of shillings at 25. Fuxingyong Hengchangyong sold at 7 yuan and 3 jiao. Huixiang Fuxingyong Dada Decheng joined forces to buy, breaking through the 800 yuan mark, rising to 800 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengyu took advantage of the high price to sell, retreating to 799 yuan and 1 jiao. Yongli Fuxing Yongshang advanced to 801 yuan and 1 jiao. Wabi sold July shillings at 7 pence. Dade Cheng Shunfa sold, falling within 800 yuan. Sentiment remained strong, demand exceeded supply. Fuxing Yongwan Yu Chang Dada Dafu Hengyu Dafa Yongqian Changxiang bought, gradually rising.

The spot market situation was slightly looser yesterday. Tianjin goods added 13 yuan yesterday, but no transactions were made. Footing Red was also only increased by sixteen yuan.

The foreign interest rate market was 1 jiao and 2 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, and the overnight loans were initially made with a blank stroke, but later, because there were still many seekers, the closing price was 3 points. As for the trading of discount bills, the morning market had a turnover of more than 3.9 million yuan, the new transactions were more than 400,000 yuan, the afternoon market had a turnover of more than 200,000 yuan, and the total transaction volume in the small association was 500,000 yuan. In the foreign mortgage loan transaction, more than 600,000 yuan were redeemed, and more than 800,000 yuan were newly made. As for the trading of banknotes, more than 1.3 million yuan were recovered. In terms of issuance, there were 500,000 yuan of circulating notes, 600,000 yuan of secret notes, more than 40,000 yuan of various cabinet payments, 100,000 yuan of customer road categories, and 2.1 million yuan of money house foreign public bill settlements. The Chinese merchant banks collected and settled more than 2.5 million yuan in bills and more than 400,000 yuan in payments. All kinds of cargo tax miscellaneous and other payments were collected and settled for more than 4 million yuan. 200,000 yuan of membership fees were paid out. In addition, although foreign merchant banks regularly collected and settled payments in the morning, the amounts were very small, so no report was made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the auxiliary currency market also felt sluggish. The Jiangnan small foreign coins were 834 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, 5 jiao less than the previous day. There were only 2,000 jiao in transactions made in the afternoon market, and nothing was heard in the morning market. The Guangdong small foreign coins still opened at 733 yuan and 7 jiao in the morning market, and changed to 733 yuan and 5 jiao in the afternoon market, so the result was 2 jiao less than the previous day. 180,000 jiao were made in the morning market, and 70,000 jiao were made in the afternoon market. Because the supply of copper coins was not large, the market tended to decline. The market yesterday was shortened by 1,000 cash compared to the previous day, to 335,000 cash. The transaction amount was 28,475 strings of cash, with a total price of 8,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges on the 8th at the Shanghai Clearing House was 6,317,148 yuan, 5 jiao and 3 fen, including 3,300,701 yuan and 7 jiao of silver dollars and 3,009,446 yuan, 9 jiao and 8 fen and 2 li of exchange silver dollars.</p>

<p>Today, the May Fifth Memorial is a Market Holiday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was even more sluggish. The sparseness of transactions can be considered a new record since January 28th. The total turnover for the entire day was only 3.37 million yuan. Looking back at the daily turnover of 30 to 40 million yuan last year, one cannot help but feel the changes of the times. The bond market has been brewing and fluctuating for quite some time. Its state of wanting to rise but lacking strength, and wanting to fall but stopping, is also unprecedented in previous fluctuations. The underlying reason is that both the bulls and bears have had their fill. The bulls, due to tight credit and high market prices, are unwilling to absorb as much as possible. The bears, seeing a stable environment and a depletion of chips, do not dare to short sell. Both sides are watching and holding each other, and the market has no development to speak of. Based on the current situation, it is difficult to be active for the time being. The total number of accounts held by the Shanghai Office is approximately 60 million, with the 96 account being the largest, accounting for one-third of the accounts. Its future waves are likely to be many. Yesterday's market results showed more declines than gains. The 96 bond fell by a fraction. The results of the gains and losses are listed below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<p>New Feng Yanghang reported that yesterday (the 7th), the New York stock market was weak in sentiment. Also, because silver prices tended to fall, the market situation also went downstream. Secretary of the Treasury Morgen Thao is scheduled to give a radio speech next Monday, and traders are quite uneasy. The bond market saw mixed gains and losses. After the railroad retirement fund case ruling, a large number of railroad bonds came out, and US government bonds also fell. Small exchange stocks had no significant fluctuations. The total turnover for the day was 810,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market has been trending down this month, and the market condition is very weak. According to market sources, a certain merchant is due to deliver goods this month. Because they cannot reach an agreement with a certain party, they have recently continued to sell off, causing panic and intensifying the selling trend. This month alone, the price has fallen by 1.3 yuan. The situation for distant months is slightly calmer. As for spot yarn, procurement from the South continues unabated.</p>
<p>A Certain Party Sells Off Near-Term Marked Yarn</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, this month was flat. The distant months saw an increase. In the second session, due to the rise in the cotton market, the situation tightened, and buying interest was stronger, showing an upward trend in the market. Unexpectedly, in the third session, a sudden drop occurred in this month, with market rumors saying that a certain merchant came to sell again at a high price. According to market rumors, due to the lack of cooperation from the factory, they were unable to deliver goods last month. They are currently extremely discouraged towards the bulls, so the near months are extremely depressed. As a result, this month's closing price fell by 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day, while distant months rose or fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. At the afternoon opening, this month was weak, but spot yarn transactions still had over 1,000 bales traded by the Guang Gang. However, the marked yarn remained sluggish and failed to stimulate market sentiment. As a result, this month's price fell another 0.6 yuan compared to the morning price, while distant months dropped by 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. It was found that Yu Da sold 350 bales, Da Feng 450 bales, Sui Long 400 bales, Tai Xing 400 bales, Jun Chang 600 bales, Run Kang 2,450 bales, and Tong Ji 950 bales. Da Feng bought 300 bales, Tong Ji 550 bales, Chang Yu 400 bales, Geng Feng 1,200 bales, Yuan Yi 900 bales, Yong Da 550 bales, Xin Cheng 350 bales, Shen Ji 450 bales, and Chang Feng 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Inventory</p>
<p>May Term 174.7 173.1 173.1 Fell 3.0 33,650</p>

<p>October Term 178.6 177.9 178.0 0.10 8,300</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Over 1,000 Bales for the Day Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,025 bales for the day, similar to the previous day. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 885 Shantou 10 Weihaiwei 10</p>
<p>Inland 80 Ningbo 40</p>
<h3 id="e215">Marked Cotton Tables are Particularly Tight <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains high, with rising trends occurring from time to time. Because general cotton merchants are closing out large amounts of quota cotton, a certain company has shifted from short to long, and Geng Feng continues to short, so the table is quite tight. However, in reality, each route still has 40% of the cotton in storage that has not been shipped out. The amount of cotton in storage in Shanghai is one to two times higher than at the same time ten years ago. There are also several yarn factories that have closed their doors and have not yet resumed work.</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Close Out Large Amounts of Zheng Standard Cotton</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, each month tended to rise, and the situation was quite fierce. Because there were too many shorts this month, the climate in the north has been slightly earlier recently, but it is still early. However, general spot cotton merchants have purchased quite a lot in the past. Currently, seeing that the environment is slightly favorable, they take the opportunity to buy in the market. There is also some discussion that in recent years, during the transition between new and old cotton, cotton prices will inevitably rise. Therefore, a certain company and the Tongzhou Gang have successively bought to turn long, and the Yong Gang is also buying. Therefore, the table is still tight and the opening yarn market is inversely proportional. July and August saw 35 yuan again. Later, the bulls spit out and rebounded slightly. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, it was flat. The first session fell, and the third session rebounded again. Because Geng Feng came to cover shorts again, the closing was flat. As a result, each month was the same as the morning closing price. It was found that Tong Ji sold 5,000 dan, Yuan Da 2,100 dan, Rui Da 2,300 dan, Ren Feng 1,100 dan, Yuan Yi 2,100 dan, Heng Chang 1,500 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,200 dan, Xin Cheng 5,300 dan, and Yi Kang 2,200 dan. Da Fu bought 1,400 dan, Ji Jian 2,500 dan, Tong Ji 1,000 dan, Yi Yu 2,600 dan, Yu Kang 1,400 dan, Da Feng 3,000 dan, Geng Feng 7,900 dan, Chang Feng 3,400 dan, Nai Xing Chang 4,900 dan, and Shui Da 1,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>May Term 33.95 33.85 33.85 Rose 0.10 127,100</p>

<p>Raw Cotton Demand is Light</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is becoming more and more light. Factory demand is quite slack. The sources are estimated to be 1,500 bales of Yao cotton, 260 bales of Tong cotton, and 800 dan (market jin) of Tianjin crude cotton were purchased by Guangfeng Factory. Spot goods were sent to Wuxi.</p>
<p>Lingbao cotton 51.15 public, Da Chang allowed 300 pieces, spot goods sent to the factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, the market was quiet and firm. Except for the March term, which fell by 4 points, the remaining months fell by 1 point. The amount sold off by the bulls was absorbed by peers and Japanese merchants. The Liverpool gang solely sold off the March term in the morning. The central oilcake belt continued to have rain, but the weather next month was irrelevant to market prices. In the afternoon, due to the weakness of the wheat market and the stock market, New Orleans sold off, and the market was sluggish. Before the close, peers bought cotton, causing the decline to be blocked. Spot cotton demand is still good, but unfortunately, due to high prices, there were not many transactions. The closing was stable. It is estimated that spot prices remained unchanged, old cotton rose by 1 to 2 points, and new cotton fell by 2 to 6 points. English spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 2 to 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to Japanese merchants buying and speculator support. It is estimated that Pingguo remained unchanged, Aomula rose by half a rupee, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.75 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th telegram):</p>

<p>Flour merchants look forward to the market every day. After the opening of the market in the morning, each month's contracts showed signs of fluctuating and turning upward. However, foreign wheat quotations showed that Chicago fell by around 45 points, and Canada fell by 0.20 yuan or less. When the opening prices were announced, due to favorable weather and falling foreign wheat prices, the sentiment was stable. However, as the spot flour supply for this month was not abundant, the guest gangs remained steadfast in their bids. The factory's selling of distant-month contracts was very quiet, and outsiders were quite willing to buy, and the market seemed to have more purchases than sales, and the market atmosphere became more firm. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading in each month's contracts was generally quiet, as actual sales only focused on the near-term. The new wheat in the distant months was already approaching, so they did not dare to be overly greedy. Observing the current situation, it seemed difficult for both gains and losses to occur. However, there were widespread rumors in the market that the foreign wheat tariff would revert to the old tariff plus around 70%, and if this was announced, the distant months should improve slightly. As a result, this month improved by 0.002 yuan or leveled, June improved by 0.0075 yuan, July 0.005 yuan, August improved by 0.0075 yuan, September improved by 0.01 yuan, and October improved by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<p>Although yesterday's futures wheat market first leveled and then turned upward, foreign wheat quotations showed that Chicago fell by around 45 points, and Canada fell by 0.20 yuan. When the opening prices were announced, due to falling foreign wheat prices, the sentiment was leveled. The initial opening was similar to the previous day. Then, as there were fewer sellers and more buyers, because of the transformation of the flour market, demand was quite urgent, and subsequent opening prices gradually improved. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading in each month's contracts was quite lively, and prices were again fluctuating. As the weather was clear, it was difficult for sentiment to become too high. As a result, this month rose by 0.02 yuan, and August rose by 0.02 yuan. , September rose by 0.01 yuan. For spot wheat, as the factories saw that the spot flour sales were still good, they were quite greedy and reduced their asking prices. The general bids were 0.05 yuan higher, with Shandong wheat opening at 4.05 yuan, Xuzhou wheat at 4.03 yuan, Bengbu Haizhou wheat at 4.00 yuan, Henan wheat at 3.98 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 3.92 yuan, Zhumadian wheat at 3.889 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.74 yuan. Youquxin went to 3,000 bags, and Xinda went to 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday (South Shanghai), a total of more than 50 companies arrived with native rice (totaling more than 10,000 dan), which caused the sentiment to slump and sales to be strangely stagnant. All the rice dealers suspended purchases. At the same time, because the sellers had not been able to sell for a long time, they inevitably panicked and lowered their asking prices to seek sales. As a result, the market tone suddenly softened, and prices of all thick-grained and thin-grained rice fell sharply by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. However, the noon market recovered slightly after this drop, and the situation seemed bearish. Except for 變元, which did not soften, (North Shanghai) more than 30 boats arrived from the river. All the goods on the market were cleared out. 高貨價 prices of high-quality 开白粳 rice rose by a small fraction of a yuan, and secondary goods also rose by a small amount of just over 0.10 yuan. 薄稻 high-quality goods were stable, and secondary goods saw abundance. Prices of early rice generally fell by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, and the price of 白元 also fell slightly. The prices of other goods fell more than they rose.</p>
<p>The arrival of imported rice has been constant in recent days, and there are still goods on the way arriving daily. Therefore, merchants and wholesalers are seeking to sell. After a small number of goods on the way were sold off at low prices the night before, all rice prices were weak at yesterday's opening. However, the inland gangs were still able to take advantage of small profits, and the market did not see another crazy drop. However, Saigon No. 3 had already recovered by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan, and other rice had also been reduced by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Inland demand is still strong, and Zhejiang needs even more. However, yesterday most were intent on reducing prices for continued purchases, so trading was not as active as in previous days. In the total market, more than 9,000 bags of Saigon spot rice and rice on the way, more than 2,000 bags of 小绞, and more than 5,000 bags of Siamese 暹茄辣地 高贡回範 大绞, etc., were offered. For 客秈 rice, 1,600 bags of Han口 沙市 rough rice were offered, of which, except for more than 1,000 bags of 西贡 going to the local market, all were bought by the inland market.</p>

<p>Recently, the soybean cake market conditions have been flat, leading to a softening of the market atmosphere. Yesterday, a Tongsheng relative's factory, due to the new opening, was operating day and night. As a result, the stock of spot cake has accumulated daily. Therefore, they depreciated prices in the market to attract purchases. It is estimated that 15,000 pieces of Four-Brand cake were sold at a price of 1.138 yuan, which were purchased by gangs from inland and Shantou. Other factories were unwilling to sell cheaply, but the buyers were not greedy either, leading to stagnation. Currently, Four-Brand cake is the most sought-after in the soybean cake market, so the prices of other cakes rise or fall accordingly. It is heard that for each cake factory, apart from Dayouyu Factory, all brands above Four-Brand will rise by 0.10 yuan, and all brands below Four-Brand will fall by 0.09 yuan. For other factories, prices must rise by 0.11 yuan or fall by 0.10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Silk and Tea 婺休 (Wu Xiu) New Tea 斋帮 (Zhai Gang) Opening <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The development of new tea in Wuyuan is later than in Xiu, but this year the climate is particularly early. Coupled with the continuous rainy days in the first two sentences, the tea trees in the counties and Zhouyuan gardens are already lush and flourishing. A small number of mountain households in the north townships have advanced the production of Mao Feng. Recently, with clear weather, the tea leaves have been exposed to dew every morning, and the quality has turned from Qingkong to soft and thick. From yesterday onwards, tea gardens in various villages in the four townships have been harvested. The poor see tea mornings in the east township, and most imitate the "tea example," selling zero kilograms. Because tea merchants have suffered losses due to continuous business, they are unwilling to take in tea unless they cut prices. Therefore, although the mountain households want to seek high prices, they cannot. The new spot market yesterday only sold for 0.33 yuan per kilogram, equivalent to 33 yuan per dan, which is lower than last year's mountain price by just over a few yuan. However, in the eighth district of Beixiang Jujian Yuan and the seventh district of Xigu Yuan, the areas with the most abundant tea production, due to rampant bandits, the tea that can be harvested cannot be harvested and produced in time. Both the merchants and the households have not yet opened their gardens and entered the market.</p>
<p>The new tea in Xiuyi County is developing very rapidly. Mountain households in the west have opened their gardens early. Among them, the poor tea farmers have no tea silver to release goods, so they can only produce and sell at will, selling the tea produced daily to the merchants. The merchants also search for and select tender leaves. The new spot market opens at only 0.434 yuan per kilogram, equivalent to about 434 yuan per dan, which is lower than last year's mountain price by more than 20 yuan. The market atmosphere is sluggish, and the mountain households are suffering, which is rare.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Sugar Market 加税 (Tax Increase) is Optimistic for Guangdong Coarse White Sugar <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to a certain party's message, there is a saying that the tax increase will definitely be implemented on June 1st. Therefore, the market atmosphere and sentiment are both good. The guild divided the market for No. 24 Dutch coarse white spot goods, and the price rose by 0.1 yuan to 16.5 yuan. Re-exported tariffed goods were 5.45 yuan, all of which were traded. The number of sellers was very low, indicating that the future trend is still promising. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company was scheduled to tender yesterday. Guangdong coarse white sugar was temporarily held due to the optimistic outlook for the tax increase. 1,000 bags of Dutch coarse white sugar were still tendered at 16.7 yuan, which was 0.25 yuan different from the marked price, and of course, could not be traded. Zhenyu No. 1 of this factory's Mian Bai sugar opened at 15.9 yuan, and then called down to 6 yuan. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were returned as is. Taikoo sugar, today's Mark spot goods, were at 17.3 yuan, and the marked price was short of trading volume, and were still in progress.</p>

<p>Glutinous rice branches are the highest quality of dried lychee. Recently, due to both arrivals and inventory being severely low, the base is very scarce, so the trend is suddenly tight, and it has risen by more than 10 yuan. It was found that the previous price was 150 yuan, and yesterday the market had already reached 165 yuan. The next batch of goods from the merchants is said to require 200 yuan. Although no transaction has been made, it shows a glimpse of the tight prices.</p>

<p>The price of raw peanuts is gradually tightening because foreign merchants in Qingdao are making moves. Local Guang gangs are very interested in importing.

<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Nowadays, most people know that vegetables contain many vitamins, so many people like vegetarian food. However, if you carefully check the customs trade books, the vegetables and fruits imported from Japan alone amount to 14 to 15 million yuan each year. Furthermore, if you go to restaurants and eateries to take a look, most of the vegetables and fruits used are imported goods. In this situation, how can the rural areas not go bankrupt? How can wealth not be depleted? The day before yesterday, I went with many old friends to the Shanghai West Farm run by Wang Junzhixin in Caohejing for a meal. I felt that the more than eighty acres of farmland were planted with cauliflower, tomatoes, asparagus, cabbage, coriander, peas, broad beans, and fruits of all kinds. I think this is where the wealth of the rural areas lies. Why don't general restaurants and residents buy domestic vegetables and fruits, but instead use imported goods? Perhaps they still don't know? However, there are many like the Shanghai West Farm, all worried about not having a way to sell their products. Ren Shigang asked me to publish this and introduce it to comrades who love using domestic goods.</p>
<p>Mr. Tianxu Wosheng, recently, in his spare time, has enjoyed writing articles very much. What he likes to talk about most is the issue of paper. I haven't seen him for a long time, but what he always keeps in mind is to solve the problem of paper's outlet. This year is the Student National Goods Year, and it is also the year when everyone is unanimously encouraging young people to read. However, the many books and newspapers that students read are all printed on foreign paper. How wasteful is this? The Promotion Association of Student National Goods Year, because primary school textbooks are mostly printed with foreign paper, conducted an investigation. If domestic paper is used instead, each student will spend an additional two dimes of silver each year on books. They hope that parents are willing to spend an extra two dimes per year for their children to make up for this great regret. This is very meaningful. I think book industry figures such as Wang Yunwu, Lu Feibohong, and Lu Gaoyi must be thinking of a good way to prevent students in the Student National Goods Year from painfully reading materials printed on foreign paper?</p>
<h3 id="e227">### May Ninth and the Promotion of National Goods <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Today is the May Ninth National Humiliation Memorial Day. In other words: "It is the first National Humiliation Memorial Day on which the Republic of China suffered the most vicious treatment from imperialists." When we think back to this day twenty years ago, we can't help but have endless thoughts and indignation! I think that all compatriots of the Republic of China probably share this sentiment!</p>
<p>However, how can we thoroughly redress this extraordinary national humiliation? Some people say: "We must have the whole country, from top to bottom, make concerted efforts, strive for external solutions, and strive for the development and improvement of our own capabilities in order to find a way." Some people say: "We must strengthen our military and prepare for a decisive battle with the imperialists who have invaded us in order to find a way out and escape from death." While we cannot say that these arguments are meaningless or without value, in my humble opinion, promoting national goods is also an effective way to avenge this humiliation. How so? Please listen to my explanation.</p>
<p>We know that the reason why China cannot stand against the great powers can be summed up in one sentence: it is because the country is poor and the people are impoverished. Why has it come to this state of national poverty and popular impoverishment? To put it thoroughly, it is because the Chinese people do not love to use national goods but specialize in using foreign goods, resulting in the outflow of snow-white silver dollars, with hundreds of millions upon hundreds of millions being exported each year, which is a huge fatal blow. Since the founding of the Republic of China, if we carefully calculate the annual trade deficit figures and the silver export figures, the numbers would certainly be extremely alarming! I ask: If a country suffers from the trade deficit and invasion of foreign goods to such an extent, how can it not fall into a state of national poverty and popular impoverishment? Therefore, I deeply feel that promoting national goods is indeed one of the effective ways to avenge our humiliation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I sincerely hope that when the whole country commemorates the May Ninth National Humiliation today, everyone will make a resolution. No matter what field one is in—agriculture, industry, commerce, education, or the military—everyone should establish a belief in using national goods. From now on, whether it is what we eat, wear, live in, or any other item, if there is a national product available, we will absolutely not buy foreign goods. If all compatriots throughout the country have such a concept and such a determination, I can say that within five years, the unemployment problem in the Republic of China will definitely be resolved. The so-called state of national poverty and popular impoverishment in China, which has been covered by great national humiliation for twenty years, will naturally be avenged.</p>
<p>I hope that all beloved compatriots throughout the country will quickly rise up and make efforts! Seize this opportunity of the May Ninth National Humiliation Memorial Day to advance on this path of national goods for national salvation!</p>
<h3 id="e228">My Views on Industrial Control <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Fumei</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that Chinese industry has caused overproduction due to the lack of control. Because of overproduction, there is mutual infighting. Because of mutual infighting, everyone perishes together. Therefore, industry is declining and cannot resist foreign goods. Therefore, it has specifically submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to handle industrial control in order to save the situation. This matter concerns the future of the national industry, and we should carefully review it. To say that China, which is regarded by foreigners as the end of dumping and whose industry is extremely immature, is suffering from overproduction is probably not a fact. This is very obvious. Without statistics or investigation, to be alarmed by overproduction seems uneasy.</p>
<p>The reason why national goods cannot compete with foreign goods is that technology, management, organization, equipment, machinery, and other aspects are behind others. The domestic industry also differs in its costs due to the differences in the above-mentioned issues. Costs vary, and prices also rise and fall accordingly. Industrial competition thus arises. As a result of competition, the industry itself is able to strive for improvement, reduce costs, and innovate technology. Thus, the people can use cheap goods to resist foreign goods invisibly. Moreover, survival of the fittest is a natural law. Therefore, controlling industry to avoid overproduction does not seem appropriate for modern China. I fear that the harm will come before the benefits are seen, only giving foreign goods the opportunity to drive straight in.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the urgent measures to save the decline of industry are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>(1) The government should ensure the protection of domestic industries and provide convenience everywhere.</p>
<p>(2) Increase import taxes to prevent the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<p>(3) Reduce or exempt import taxes on raw materials that are not produced domestically.</p>
<p>(4) Abolish transit taxes and export taxes, as well as various exorbitant taxes.</p>
<p>(5) Encourage exports. For industrial products that are exported, the government should refund the taxes paid on the raw materials or provide special subsidies to encourage them to engage in foreign development.</p>
<p>(6) The government should investigate production and sales, as well as import and export situations, and publish them from time to time so that the national industry can follow suit.</p>
<p>(7) The government should promptly implement trade control and exchange rate management to seek offsetting revenues and expenditures and limit the outflow of useless money in order to stabilize national finances and make domestic industrial development easier.</p>
<p>(8) The government should establish research and improvement institutions to guide the national industry at any time in order to seek technical, management, and other improvements.</p>
<p>(9) Each industry should establish its own goods inspection office to inspect whether the goods have any defects before they are sold. Strictly prevent shoddy manufacturing that hinders the reputation of national goods.</p>
<p>(10) Encourage Chinese people to use national goods. As far as my limited knowledge is concerned, I have written this in a disorganized manner, hoping to provide something for those who care about the domestic industry to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="e229">What Sai Jinhua Said About Mr. Hong Jun <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>— A Small Anecdote of Officials Who Loved National Goods —</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion of the Gengzi year! In the midst of the Eight-Nation Alliance's attack on Beijing, Sai Jinhua, the female heroine who reversed the situation and supported the endangered, in Liu Bannong's "The Story of Sai Jinhua," there is a small anecdote about her husband, Mr. Hong Jun, loving national goods! She said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hong has been in Europe for a full three years. During these three years, besides handling official duties, he spent almost all his time studying. Mr. Hong is very shrewd, but his temperament is too stubborn. When he arrived in Europe, he refused to use any foreign items at all. He still wore those three-layered 'Fu' character shoes, cloth socks..." and so on.</p>
<p>When I saw that Mr. Hong Jun, as the Qing Dynasty's envoy to Germany, could love national goods in this way, I couldn't help but feel a sense of respect and admiration arise spontaneously! It is especially commendable that he could stand out from the crowd in an environment of Westernization! We cannot dismiss him with a single stroke simply because he was a stubborn feudal figure! As the times have progressed to the present, things have only gotten worse! In the minds of consumers, they think that Western materials are more advanced, and that only by using foreign goods can one be considered fashionable! But the white silver is flowing away! Withered to death! Can you survive alone? According to this argument! We may be able to be careless about other matters, but only by purchasing and using national goods should the public use stubborn habits, unchanging for life! To save our Chinese nation, which is critically ill!</p>
<h3 id="e230">A Glimpse of Visiting the Hongda Art Flower Factory <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Chunquan</p>
<p>The Hongda Art Flower Factory is located at Yaojiashiqiao, Zhabei, Shanghai. The distribution address is No. 304 Kangti Road, Beile Road, French Concession. Mr. Hu Rongda is in charge of the engineering, and Mr. Wu Jingshi is in charge of the business. In terms of its business category, it specializes in making art flowers, also known as decalcomania. Art flowers were originally invented in Europe and the United States, and were later imitated by the Japanese and sold to China. The largest portion of its sales is to porcelain shops in Jiangxi Province, used as landscapes, flowers, and figures on porcelain. In addition, sewing machines, wireless radios, phonographs, tennis rackets, bicycles, and spray-painted equipment that are difficult to print trademarks or other color separations on with a printing press can all be pasted with art flowers. They are bright and eye-catching, not easy to peel off, and not easy to counterfeit, so everyone likes to use them.</p>
<p>Engineer Hu Rongda of the factory, in view of the huge outflow of our country's funds every year, studied with great care. Initially, the depth and matching of colors were not uniform and appropriate, and the gold thread used was not bright enough. After several years of practical experience, he finally succeeded and can match foreign goods. The gold trademark on the Shanghai Baonuan vacuum flask is produced by the factory.</p>
<p>The organization of the factory is very simple due to its initial creation, and it is divided into four departments: (1) business, (2) paper making, (3) stone engraving, and (4) machinery. Except for the business department, which is solely responsible for distribution and liaison and is not very relevant to this article and will not be described, in addition: (1) The paper making department has a chemistry room, which specializes in mixing various chemicals to form a paste-like liquid and coating it on paper. It also has a drying room to dry it into chemical paper. (2) The stone engraving department has a drawing room and a stone engraving room, which accepts samples from all walks of life, copies them, and engraves them on the stone. (3) The machinery department receives the completed printing stone frame from the stone engraving department, places it on the machine, and prints various colors on the chemical white paper to make art flower paper, which is transferred to various utensils. Kangyuan Can Manufacturing Factory also manufactures art flowers, which will be described in detail in another article.</p>

<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Let us talk about the past, in those years, the Chinese people did not compete to love their country, the great powers were fighting for supremacy on Earth, our country was weak and it was difficult to stand shoulder to shoulder. Whenever great disasters came, we would sing and dance wildly, and at the same time, greedily purchase foreign goods, causing the country to be weak and the people poor, it was truly pitiful. So much outflow of funds is difficult to calculate, causing people to sigh deeply as if being tortured. That is why the Chinese people advocate Chinese goods, and national goods markets are established everywhere, frequently using words to promote them. It is most hateful that the Chinese people are addicted to foreign goods, ignoring the harms and being greedy for cheapness. They are earning our money to make guns and cannons, and their intentions are as vicious as arsenic. I hope that our compatriots will quickly wake up, and no longer be like fools, drunkards, or sleepers. Commercial competition is the current era, any style is valuable and new, and the people loving their country must compete to be first, knowing that economic aggression is like long guns and cannons stealing people's money. From now on, let us no longer use foreign goods, so as not to donate funds abroad, saving the crisis is right before our eyes!</p>

<h3 id="e234">"Swearing" and "Implementation" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of children raise their hands together,</p>
<p>Protecting the family, the country, and the people.</p>
<p>At 3 PM on the 18th of last month, more than 10,000 right hands were raised in the square in front of the Municipal Government; a chorus of voices recited the oath to use national goods. It was tragic, passionate, and unprecedented. This was the swearing-in ceremony held by representatives selected from all the large, medium, and small male and female students in Shanghai to use national goods.</p>
<p>If these more than 10,000 students sincerely persuade their family members and friends, from ten thousand to hundreds of millions, from hundreds of millions to trillions, it is really not a difficult thing. However, I hope that the students who took the oath on that day do not regard the oath as a routine formality. Once the oath is taken, the matter is over, and they can freely buy foreign goods and regard national goods as worthless. Wouldn't this be superfluous?</p>
<p>In ancient times, people believed in divine power, so they regarded oaths as very important. Once a word was spoken, with the testimony of Heaven, Earth, mountains, rivers, the sun, and the moon, they dared not change their minds for the rest of their lives. Therefore, Cao Mo kidnapped Duke Huan of Qi, and Mao Sui kidnapped King of Chu, both demanding that they take a blood oath before letting them go. And these hegemonic rulers who controlled the power of life and death dared not violate their oaths, lest they provoke divine wrath. There are many similar things in history, and I cannot list them all one by one. Now people generally understand that the gods of Heaven, Earth, mountains, rivers, the sun, and the moon do not actually care about these trivial matters; even the city gods and Guanyin, who are worshipped by everyone, only know how to enjoy incense and blood sacrifices, and completely ignore these toothache spells. They may say nice things in their mouths, but in reality, they do exactly the opposite. Therefore, I hope that the students who took the oath on that day will truly act according to the oath. We do not believe in divine power, and we do not believe that violating the oath will bring "divine punishment." However, taking the oath is to express our "determination" and courage. This "determination" and "courage" are not just empty words; we must truly act on them.</p>
<p>"Five-minute maturity." "Forgetfulness." Enemies often use these words to ridicule us. That's right! We have indeed made these mistakes in the past. But from today onwards, especially starting with the students who are known as the intellectual class, let us get rid of these bad habits. Be able to speak and act. Since we have sworn to use national goods, then let us earnestly start using them ourselves and also persuade others to use them.</p>

<p>— (Baling)</p>
<p>The tragic May is already upon us! We do not know what feelings our Chinese compatriots have about the arrival of this tragic and miserable May? I think: all compatriots with blood and ambition cannot be unmoved, right?</p>
<p>"Avenging humiliation," "avenging humiliation," cannot be effective by shouting it out or writing it down. The most important thing is that the whole country, from top to bottom, must strive to rise up, seek the improvement and development of their own positions, and jointly use national goods in order to gradually achieve good results.</p>
<p>Everyone considers May to be an "inauspicious month." Some people even say that it is a "poisonous month." However, in my opinion, May can be called a "month of struggle." As long as everyone sees the many national humiliations of China in May and strives to rise up, determined to do something for the country and the nation, isn't May a "month of struggle"? If we still pass the national humiliation memorial days in May in the same muddleheaded way as usual, then May is truly a "poisonous month," May is truly an "inauspicious month"!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Wonderful Art of Stealing Wine <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The "wine" referred to here is "Shaoxing wine." Shaoxing wine is transported and sold everywhere, and it must rely on the Guotang Bank. Let's close our eyes and imagine: a large ship carrying hundreds of jars of wine, including all kinds of Jingzhuang, natural color, Huadiao, etc., wouldn't that make the wine ghosts drool? A generation of boatmen then invented two wonderful arts of stealing wine:</p>
<p>One method of stealing wine is relatively simple, that is, using a long iron pipe, aiming at the wine jar and poking it in the middle of the sealing mud, and sucking it with the mouth; or placing the jar horizontally to allow the wine to leak out. However, this method may sometimes fail, because some jar mouths are sealed with small bamboo leaves, etc., and covered with a dish. This makes the wine thieves unable to use their skills. This spring, I opened two jars of wine, one with only a dish covering the mouth. At that time, I still didn't know what the dish was for, but now I know that it was set up for stealing wine.</p>
<p>There is also a method that relies on a secret medicine. Apply this medicine to the outside of the wine jar, about the size of a cup mouth; to say it a little smaller, perhaps the size of a foreign coin. It is said that after smoking about two cigarettes, the jar material at the application site has loosened, and there are countless sand eyes, and the wine will naturally seep out. After enough wine has been stolen, they gently apply date paste, and the jar becomes seamless again; unless the jar is weighed, no one can see that there is already a problem with it.</p>
<p>Every industry originally has its drawbacks, and it is not only the transportation of wine that is the case. Moreover, stealing wine is still an elegant matter, so it seems that there is no need to blame it deeply. However, in order to prevent fraud, I would like to persuade a generation of wine-loving friends. If you want to entrust Shaoxing wine merchants or friends to transport wine, it is best to weigh it at the Guotang Bank before transporting it to see how heavy it is and record it on the bill of lading; then, you can guarantee that there will be no loss.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Tortoise and Lion <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>— After visiting the London Preview —</p>
<p>There is a Mr. "Xinzhen" in Shanghai Tongli who wrote a Yangjingbang bamboo branch poem, saying: "This time, it is shipped to the West, and when it returns, people will look at it with new eyes." Although the words are colloquial, the implication is imaginable.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is beyond imagination, the treasures accumulated over thousands of years will cross the Atlantic Ocean. This is a major event after China's opening up, and also a major event in Chinese cultural history worth writing about.</p>
<p>But after visiting this grand art preview, I couldn't help but think of the categories of Chinese sculptures—the objects near the tortoise and the lion.</p>
<p>The form of the lion represents majesty and power. Now, whether in rural villages or cities, in front of the old-fashioned so-called "gilded world" gates, you can always see a pair of stone-carved lions sitting on stone drums. If it is in Peiping, that is even better, you can also see copper carvings. The appearance is even more magnificent. Seeing these things will make people admire the amazing artistic skills of the time and be surprised that the world despises ancient culture in this way.</p>
<p>As for the tortoise, in the eyes of ancient people, it may have been a kind of spiritual creature with a mysterious meaning, sometimes used to symbolize "longevity, health, and auspiciousness." In ancient times, there were "tortoise shells," "tortoise years," "divine tortoises," and so on. Therefore, in Peiping, outside the palace-style houses, there were often "copper tortoises" and the like placed. Looking at that posture, it is also so proud, with no despicable shape.</p>
<p>Ancient culture was originally static. The tortoise, with its natural thick appearance, is still generous, so it can also be displayed in temples, although the common people feel that it is regarded as a lowly animal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the tortoise and the lion occupy a considerable position in the temple art. However, this type of object only has sculptures and no paintings, which is quite perplexing.</p>

<p>Chapter 13: It's Difficult to Make Wedding Clothes for Others, and It's Pitiful to Sell Oneself; Commodities as Slaves are Also Happy to Go Bankrupt, Speaking of Farmers</p>
<p>When Cheng Zhiqian and Zhou Yourong were talking about the teachers in the Northwest, Wang Beihai, this young man, sighed deeply next to them. Zhou Yourong smiled and said: Before the report, this little brother sighed first, there must be something embarrassing here, so please speak slowly. Wang Beihai said: Before I say it, I want the two gentlemen to understand that the Northwest is a place where even eating is a problem, so where can we talk about education funding? Therefore, the teachers' treatment is meager, and it is not the responsibility of any one party. Zhiqian smiled and said: You child, you can be a journalist in the future. In order to avoid offending people, I will put such a hat on first. So, now that you have a hat, you can speak. Beihai smiled and said: We are talking about primary schools, so let's talk about primary school teachers. Of course, in places with convenient transportation or wealth, the schools will naturally have principals, grade teachers, and the teachers will be adequately prepared. But this is a very small proportion of the entire province, and other than that, everything is possible. The salaries of ordinary primary school teachers are always above thirty yuan. But in the Northwest, there are some very poor counties where primary school teachers cannot earn thirty yuan a year. My relative originally earned eight yuan a month in a primary school in an outlying county, but later, due to insufficient funding, it was reduced to six yuan a month. Because that county seat still had relatively convenient transportation, there were still many people vying for this six-yuan-a-month teacher position. As a result, my relative's job was unstable, and he saw the opportunity to act, bidding farewell to the principal and being transferred from County A to County B. (200)</p>

<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about how, on the day the Empress Dowager heard the news that Black Jade had given birth to puppies, she immediately said with delight:</p>
<p>"After the morning court session, we must first go to the dog kennel and take a look at the four newborn puppies."</p>
<p>No matter what the matter, whether it was large or small, as long as the Empress Dowager was interested in it and wanted to do it seriously, it could always be achieved! So, I think even if during the morning court session that day, the ministers brought up important matters concerning the rise and fall of the country, she would certainly not pay attention; unless foreign troops had arrived outside the capital and were about to invade the palace, then she might pay some attention, otherwise, it was absolutely impossible to shift her full attention away from those four newborn puppies. To be honest, at that time, my mind was also completely surrounded by the images of many dogs, and I only hoped that the morning court session would end quickly so that I could hurry to visit that imperial dog kennel. Because before this day, although I had been in the palace for a long time, I had never been to the Empress Dowager's dog kennel. I had then developed a habit of longing to be able to accompany the Empress Dowager every day to see new places that I had not yet visited; especially close to my heart was that every time the Empress Dowager took me to a new place, she would definitely have many interesting things to tell me, which made me feel very satisfied.</p>
<p>We were all standing in the hall, watching the many princes and ministers below the steps, one by one, walking over as usual, chanting their own names, and respectfully kowtowing upwards. (310)</p>

<p>Little Recipes</p>
<h3 id="e243">Lichun Dishes <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Fang'an</p>
<p>Lixia is one of the twenty-four solar terms, usually in the fourth month of the lunar calendar. In Tangqi, it is customary to weigh people and burn wild rice, and a few days before Lixia, people must go to the General Cao Temple in Ma'an Mountain to pray for children to be spared from sores and ulcers. These matters related to local customs will be examined and verified later, so I will not elaborate on them for now. However, the so-called "three roasts, five cured, and nine seasonal fresh," I will specifically record them as follows, which are also small recipes for Lixia.</p>
<p>The three roasts are roasted liquor, roasted goose, and roasted sesame cake. Roasted liquor is homemade, not brewed from sorghum, but made from lees, so it is called lees roast, also known as ben roast. It is strong and fragrant. Decades ago, all sauce gardens had to make it themselves, but recently it has gradually been replaced by wheat roast made in Jiangbei. Drinking it on Lixia is said to dispel the steaming air that often occurs in summer and affects the yang organs. Roasted goose is made from fat and tender geese, and it is fragrant and delicious. Roasted sesame cakes are available everywhere, so I will not describe them further.</p>
<p>The five cured are cured fish, cured meat, cured sausage, cured duck, and ash eggs, all of which are made by pickling. The fish and meat are dried and steamed, while the ash eggs are soaked in mud, salt, and brine, sealed in jars, and cooked after a certain period of time. All of these are homemade, made in winter, so they are called cured. However, some are not necessarily made in winter. Some cured meats can even be made overnight. According to Danqian Zonglu, "Cured means evening, made overnight," which is what it means. The taste of salted fish and meat is still fragrant, just like ham and cured meat are wonderful summer delicacies. Ash eggs are also called salted eggs. Although pickled goods shops sell them, they are not as good as homemade ones. Eggs from both chickens and ducks can be made, but duck eggs are better. The best ones have egg yolks that are fire-red, like crab roe. If mixed with aged vinegar, the taste is also like crab.</p>
<p>The name of the nine seasonal fresh has been passed down to this day, but people today cannot fully describe their details. As far as I know, they are loquat, green plum, cherry, black caltrop, broad bean, yellow croaker, garlic, shrimp cake, garden bamboo shoot, etc. Although they have not been completely lost, they cannot be fully said to be the nine seasonal fresh defined by the ancients. Loquat is a famous Tangqi product, with two types: white sand and red sand, and the Yangdun variety is the best. In recent years, the production and sales have been very strong, reaching far and wide. The taste is better than the lychee in Lingnan, but at the time of Lixia, it may not be yellow and blooming on the branches. Green plum is also a local product. Recently, the preserved plum with tangerine peel from Guanshengyuan is also sourced from here. At the time of Lixia, it is just when the green leaves become shady and the fruits fill the branches. Cherry fruits are like red beans, worthy of being a delicacy on the table. Black caltrop is just old caltrop in the swamp, seasonal, but lacks deliciousness. Broad beans are fat at this time. Freshly picked, whether stir-fried or steamed, they are emerald green and lovely, and their color does not change. They are fragrant, waxy, and delicious, and they are a top-grade garden vegetable. Yellow croaker is also known as stonehead fish here. In the past, they were delayed by sea permits, and they were only available in the market in summer, so they were listed as seasonal delicacies. Now, they are available all year round. Garlic is just at its peak at this time, crispy and tender. In addition to being a side dish, it also has the effect of relieving mold. Shrimp cake is made by mixing shrimp with flour and frying it in oil like a cake, so it is called shrimp cake, also known as shrimp ball. Tangqi has always been a water town, and the products of fish and shrimp are particularly abundant. No less than hundreds of thousands of people are engaged in catching shrimp, and the price is very cheap. When they first come out of the water, they are lively and fresh, and no matter how they are cooked, they are fresh and unparalleled, not only the shrimp cakes are good. However, when the shrimp cakes are made, only the whiskers are trimmed, and the carapace is left, so they are exceptionally crispy, truly a delicious snack to accompany wine. Garden bamboo shoot is different from maosun and spring bamboo shoot, because it is produced in farmers' gardens, and it is also just in season at this time.</p>
<p>Lixia dishes also include the so-called "combined scenery," which is to combine shrimp cakes, roasted liver (pork liver wrapped in pork oil and boiled in a pot of oil), crispy sausage (meat stuffing wrapped in bean curd skin and boiled), ash eggs, ham, white belly, etc. in a bowl, which is also a good summer delicacy, especially favored by those who like to drink. However, thirty miles outside of Tangqi, there is no such dish. Only the description is similar to the "All Happiness" dish.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e244">"Poetry Talk" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jiang Jiping's article "On Poetry" published in Free Talk, I found that it had many points in common with my own views. Mr. Jiping is a fan of Yuan Mei, and I also greatly admire Suiyuan. In particular, I like his Poetry Talk. Among the Qing Dynasty poets, although there were many who wrote Poetry Talk, famous ones such as Gong Zhicun's "Beijiang Poetry Talk" and Zhao Yi's "Oubei Poetry Talk", only "Suiyuan Poetry Talk" can be seen to advocate "spirit" and abandon "style", and to promote "humor".</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of "Suiyuan Poetry Talk" is that it is written with a free and easy style, and he never thinks that writing Poetry Talk should be a serious writing about poetry. So people can find in the Poetry Talk discussions about human feelings, jokes, and gossiping. It does not come across as serious. For example, one passage about Wang Yuyang says:</p>
<p>When Mr. Yuyang was the Minister of Justice, he often passed by Ciren Temple. The abbot, someone named Dong, was famous among high officials. Yuyang was quite disdainful of him. One day, Dong complained to him about being busy, probably to show off that he was often invited by princes and nobles. Yuyang did not answer for a long time, and then said solemnly, "Why don't you become a monk?" (I don't have the book at hand, but the general idea is like this.)</p>
<p>This is excellent humorous material, unrelated to poetry, and others would have rejected it. However, he recorded it casually, and we never feel that it is meddlesome.</p>
<p>In fact, what is valuable in Poetry Talk is precisely these kinds of things. If one is simply concerned with criticizing lines of poetry, what taste is left? Furthermore, poetry and prose can never be criticized in the same way. Prose values ​​truth and reality; poetry lies in spirit, in charm, in subtlety, not in style, and even less in word-by-word scrutiny. Xiya said, "When Poetry Talk is written, poetry dies." This saying is indeed true, but only for the general case. A true poetry talk is not impossible. Zhang Ji's poem says: "Maple leaves fall, crows cry, frost fills the sky, river fire, fishing boat, facing sorrow and sleep; outside Gusu city, Hanshan Temple, midnight bell rings to the passenger boat." Ouyang Xiu said that there was no bell sound at midnight, and another Poetry Talk writer argued that there was a bell sound at midnight. What does this kind of thing have to do with "poetry"? Pi Guangye's line says: "Travelers break willows with light catkins, flying swallows abandon mud with fallen flowers." Pei Guangyue said: "Willows should have catkins, swallows may not have mud." (Yuyin Conghua) Another person criticized Du Fu, "Who made you turbid wine? One drunk scatters a thousand sorrows," and said: "Wine was made by Du Kang, and Du Fu did not know it, so how can he be called a poet?" To write Poetry Talk to this extent is truly like Xiya said, "When Poetry Talk is written, poetry dies!"</p>
<p>Poets also like to meddle in other people's business. Suiyuan Poetry Talk says that the more unimportant the matter, the better, so-called blowing ripples in a pool of spring water, what business is it of yours? Yang Tieya tasted willow flowers and said: "Flying into the painted building a few spots of flowers, I don't know whose home the willows are in?" Chen Derong's Qisha poem: "May I ask Half-Lang and Weaver Girl, who crossed the magpie bridge first?" These kinds of things are extremely humorous, but Jiang Shaosheng strongly disagrees. He wrote a debate on Cowherd and Weaver Girl, forcefully saying that there were no such people and no such things. Isn't that ridiculous? I remember when Shaosheng showed his article to Suiyuan, Suiyuan only replied with the words "spoils the fun." This kind of critical attitude is extremely good, and with it to write Poetry Talk, people can keep reading.</p>
<p>Among Qing Dynasty poets, I most admire two people, Wang Yuyang and Yuan Zicai. Yuyang advocated "charm" and Zicai advocated "spirit," which were originally the same path, and their greatest strength was to eliminate the bad habits of poets, never rhyming in sequence, never collecting lines, never linking lines, never stacking rhymes, and never rhyming with ancient people. These five are all major diseases of poets, and being able to eliminate them is not easy. One step further, it is best not to use allusions, but I am afraid that Yuyang and Zicai could not do that!</p>

<p>— Zhen Shi</p>
<p>The bright moon hangs in the clear sky, and the autumn wind rustles through the bamboo forest leaves, chilling people's hearts. I put on my thin silk shirt and held a few mooncakes that my mother gave me. In the deep of night, I walked forlornly, quickly, quickly, the sighing faces of my elderly parents haunting my mind, feeling only desolation, bewilderment, and a suffocating emptiness. That night, you were the only one who accompanied me. We walked side by side, silently, silently, neither of us speaking. But we spoke with silence, ten thousand words, how could we begin to say them? Let the intermittent barking of dogs punctuate the chorus of autumn insects. The vastness of the night, the bright moon, our shadows on the ground, the sand on the road, scraped against our feet with a soft sound. Although that night still had the fragrance of the fields, it was completely devoid of poetry for us at that time.</p>
<p>We walked, silently walking, all the way to the Flying Star Bridge outside the north gate of the city. We had to part, I stopped and tightly clasped your hand, and I burst out the words with all my might:</p>
<p>"Second brother! I don't know when I can return to our hometown again... What are your plans for the future?"</p>
<p>You did not speak for a long time at that time, your eyes fixed on me, then you said in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"I can't say for sure what will happen? But I must go out, I can't stay in this house."...</p>
<p>From that night on, I began to wander. Because of the torment of life, I was unwilling to write many letters home, and you would not know where I was. We have not exchanged letters for four years. In the autumn of 1931, I learned some news about you from a visitor from my hometown, which made me unspeakably happy, and at the same time, unspeakably ashamed. But soon after, you died, and my mother also died. How can I cry for your death? I can only comfort your spirit with anger! To warm my soul. For the true love and peace of mankind, for the vengeance of the devils, I am angry, facing all the ugliness in this world.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Interest <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>Sheng Shumeng criticized Andreyev, saying: "Looking at Andreyev's works over the past twenty years, except for a very few, they all touch on social issues." He also said: "To understand Andreyev while ignoring society is like studying smoke while ignoring fire."</p>
<p>This statement is very accurate.</p>
<p>Although Andreyev once estimated everything with a pessimistic and negative eye, his works have mostly not deviated from society, which is an undeniable fact. Such a popular writer—if he must be regarded as a popular writer—whose works are not understood by the general public is inevitable.</p>
<p>All realistic depictions linked to social issues, to the general public, are not very interesting.</p>
<p>They completely read novels and do literature to find happiness, so the focus is on interest. Their interests are: the joys and sorrows of talented scholars and beautiful women, the strange behaviors and quirks of high officials and nobles, children born with three feet, monks who live to be two hundred and sixty years old, the smiles of courtesans, the thighs of dancing queens, white light spewing from nostrils, chivalrous people chasing and killing, and bizarre blood cases, strange customs, etc., all of which make them feel interesting and fun.</p>
<p>This is why Savage Notes have been published in ten volumes, and Conan Doyle has finally been able to have a broad audience.</p>
<p>However, if the above-mentioned kind of interest is transplanted into the more serious so-called pure literature, the result, I think, will not be good, and it will make readers have no intention to find the true meaning of the article. If the toxic elements are removed, then the interest of the general public will also be removed.</p>
<p>What remains is still only pure literature that cannot gain a wide audience.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is absolutely certain and unquestionable that more interest needs to be added to the more serious so-called pure literature. However, to remove the toxic elements while still retaining the interest is a difficult task, at least in our society.</p>
<p>If we want readers to be able to appreciate pure literature and understand true interest, we must liberate them from toxic, low-level interests. April 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Street <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>Skyscraper-high three-dimensional buildings, standing one after another on both sides, are the bones of the street. The arteries of the street, however, are strings of streetcars, rows of cars, and the rows of people, and these interwoven scenes constitute the complex content of the street. The things carried on the street are mostly noisy, except for lifeless houses and other still objects. What the street leaves in your memory is an incoherent agglomeration of clamorous cries and crude mixed sounds, impressions. The scene of the street is discordant and ugly. The tricycle drivers and beggars are cumbersome parasites on the street, like sores and scars on a person's body, but they can't be removed no matter what, and they are always breeding everywhere.</p>
<p>Gentlemen walking down the street arm-in-arm with noble women suddenly have a dirty hand thrust out from the side begging for alms, snot and tears mixed together running all over the face, following them and making a whining sound. This cannot but be regarded as the biggest shortcoming of an elegant street, but there are even bigger shortcomings! On the street at night, in the dazzling bright light, under people's prickly eyelids, groups of women with heavy rouge on their faces and perfume all over their bodies, whose livelihoods depend on selling their own bodies, are arranged smiling on the street. Like butterflies shuttling through the crowds, throwing seductive smiles, wicked eyeballs, and soliciting the flow of people.</p>
<p>This is an even bigger black spot on the beautiful street. The street is indeed too wretched. People may also think that these shameless people have made the street unbearable, but on the other side of the street, on the high foreign-style buildings, women wriggling in the rhythm of jazz music, whose bodies are also like commodities, feel that they can be intoxicated and intimate when they are auctioned off, and they are happy to spend money to exchange for embracing relationships. Yes, the street exists in such contradictions, thriving day by day, with new tall buildings being produced in unlimited quantities, and new shortcomings also continuing to expand at the same time. More and more people are making a living on the street by selling laughter.</p>
<p>Because everything on the street waxes and wanes together. Some things are produced, and some things are naturally consumed. The street was lively before, and it is still lively now, but it has added a lot of new tricks. Countless large cloth advertisements for year-round sales are always floating in the air. On the street, there are storefronts posting signs saying they are closing down every day. This kind of thing was rarely seen on the street in the past, but now it has become the most eye-catching ornament on the street.</p>
<p>The street was originally static and unchanging, but the things carried on the street are gradually changing. Some are increasing, and some are disappearing.</p>

<p>"Singapore" is next to the pier of Asahan. In the customs, the two Chinese novels that I brought for entertainment on the journey were entangled by the customs officers. Thanks to Mr. Lin's proficiency in Malay, he explained to the customs officers that these were for travel entertainment: "This is for 'fun', it doesn't mean anything." And we transferred from a neighboring port in the Dutch territory, not newly imported from another country. As a result, we were allowed to pass.</p>
<p>"The Dutch territory is not very unified in its administration due to its geography and history," Mr. Lin said to me after we left the customs: "So even bringing books on a journey is troublesome and risky." He added:</p>
<p>"It's best not to bring them."</p>
<p>I could only nod in silence. What could I say to the colonial subjects of the East?</p>
<p>After entering the hotel and taking a shower, we went to a Hainanese restaurant nearby for dinner.</p>
<p>Although there were not many people in the restaurant, it was very noisy. In particular, two elderly Chinese immigrants at the next table, discussing the domestic situation in Malay, were deafening. They seemed to not speak Chinese at all (this was proven after my investigation), but they were extremely concerned about national affairs. It could be seen from the fact that they were arguing about the outcome of the debate, with white foam hanging on their mouths, even to the point of fighting. I knew that since the National Revolution, the overseas Chinese community had been greatly stirred up. Seeing that even the Chinese immigrants who had already become Malayized were concerned about national affairs, it gave people great hope for the future of the nation. However, after that, what else aroused interest besides using Malay to argue about the outcome of the debate?</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. Lin accompanied me on a tour of the streets of Asahan. The "Pasar (market)," which had once caused conflicts between the Chinese and Malay people, attracted my attention even more. The "Pasar" here has a characteristic, which is that it is full of Malay people: and is quite different from other places where it is almost entirely monopolized by the Chinese.</p>
<p>"The Malay people here are very rampant," Mr. Lin told me: "Some time ago, in order to compete for the sales rights in the 'Pasar,' it caused Malay people to boycott and fight the Chinese. Later, the Dutch government secretly incited and encouraged this matter, but then used force to stop it. So far, the Chinese in Asahan have conceded in the 'Pasar.' Just imagine, if the Malay people everywhere were so stubborn, not to mention that the Chinese would suffer, even the rule of the white people would be difficult!"</p>
<p>I listened silently, without saying anything. I thought that the Chinese people's "sandwiched" position was pitiful and shameful. The Chinese and Malay people, who are both oppressed, why can't they unite harmoniously? Why do they have to fight each other? Isn't this exactly what imperialism hopes for?</p>
<p>"Since that incident," Mr. Lin continued, "the Chinese have given up the sales rights in the 'Pasar.' And the colonial government, seeing that this incited anti-Chinese trend would turn into shaking their own rule, used force and mediation to suppress the incident. Now, the Chinese are prepared for the Malay people here, and the unity of the Malay people here is also stronger than that of the natives in other places. So the Malay people's anti-Chinese sentiment may be incited again.</p>
<p>I eagerly asked:</p>
<p>"So, since that time, has the trend ever broken out again?" (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e249">Three Days (6) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>The rain still hadn’t stopped, and the northeast wind brought with it a dampness that permeated everything. Looking at the sky, it seemed it wouldn't clear up anytime soon. Huang Zhongpu carried two heavy rain boots, walking on the muddy road, his body swaying precariously, often on the verge of falling. But on the wet, muddy ground, he could vaguely see Youfa’s pitiful face, as if begging him: "Mr. Huang, please have pity on me, please go and discuss it with Master Lu, ask him to show some compassion and lend us that money. The Longhui money is only due in three days!" At those moments, Huang Zhongpu would definitely hum in his nose, showing them a bit of his power, letting them know how formidable Huang Zhongpu was. In this village, he was the one with the most face in front of Master Lu; there was no one else. He also had to teach Youfa a lesson, that ignorant fellow Youcai needed some discipline; so young and yet so stubbornly unyielding. In the end, he’d suffer losses that wouldn't be worth it. At this moment, Youfa’s pitiful appearance must be quite amusing. He would deliberately say that three days was too short and the matter might be difficult. Master Lu’s money wasn’t readily available at home. He’d keep saying this until, with great difficulty, he finally agreed to handle the matter, but only if Youcai’s wife immediately entered the Lu household as a wet nurse.</p>
<p>He walked triumphantly on the muddy road, laughing in his heart at the thought. Just as he crossed the narrow plank bridge, he saw Youcai and Hu Yongliang and a few others standing by the tofu shop. Hu Yongliang was mumbling something. Youfa’s high cheekbones and square face struck him like a blow, making him tremble violently. Youfa’s pitiful shadow disappeared to who knows where.</p>
<p>"Mr. Huang, why are you missing a tooth? Did Master Lu…" A young man beside Hu Yongliang said, and then burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Youcai also laughed crisply.</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu quickly licked the gap in his upper row of teeth with his tongue. A dozen eyes were fixed on him. He didn’t have time to hum at them dismissively. Afraid of being held up, he hurriedly walked past.</p>
<p>You little brats, don’t be so unrestrained. See if you’ll have a good outcome! Youcai, you monkey, don’t… there are still three days, three days…</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu grumbled this in his stomach. He was sure that these youngsters would come to no good end and would be severely punished as bandits by the county. He quickened his pace. He would go to the head of his bao (neighborhood watch) and make sure the bao chief urged them to pay up quickly. There were only these three days; not a single day could they be allowed to relax.

<h3 id="e250">Banning the Welcoming of Gods and Temple Fairs <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Following the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly, the welcoming of gods and temple fairs have sprung up in various localities throughout our society. Not to mention distant events, but recently, there was a welcoming of gods in Pudong followed by a temple fair in Jiangwan. This echoed throughout the city, driving everyone wild with excitement. Recently, I heard that residents of Zhabei, not wanting to be outdone, are also brewing something similar. As long as the funds are available and the authorities don't prohibit it, the grand occasion will not be less than that of Pudong and Jiangwan.</p>
<p>However, it is extremely unfortunate that during the welcoming of gods and temple fair held in Jiangwan the other day, an incident unexpectedly occurred where a member of the fire brigade burned down a statue of a god. The fire brigade member's action was intended to break superstition, and it gladdened the hearts of the people. However, this matter has aroused the anger of the local people. Merchants have petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice and to suspend the subsidy to the Jiangwan Fire Brigade. On the citizen's side, the destruction of the god statue has caused deep grief, and people are wearing black gauze armbands to express their mourning. They are also demanding that those who burned the god statue restore it to its original condition to appease public anger. The depth of superstition among the ignorant Chinese people is evident.</p>
<p>Welcoming gods and temple fairs are superstitious practices that waste manpower and money, providing no real benefit and causing harm. It is only because the Chinese people have always been deeply superstitious, and because of corrupt and outdated customs, that such foolish actions occur from time to time. And the authorities, in order to accommodate the psychology of the people, do not stop them, so this trend continues to this day, and even becomes more intense.</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Party Headquarters stated that the welcoming of gods and temple fairs in various places in the city is very prevalent, which not only violates the prohibitions, but also harms social order. Moreover, Shanghai is regarded as a place of observation by both Chinese and foreigners, and a source of cultural guidance. What is heard there is followed by the whole country. At a time when the New Life Movement is being actively carried out, the holding of these welcoming of gods and temple fairs may cause foreigners to suspect that our so-called New Life Movement is mostly like this. Therefore, it has specially sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting that it issue a prompt announcement and strictly order the Public Security Bureau to take responsibility for banning them. This will undoubtedly be of some benefit to national rejuvenation. Luo Jia</p>
<h3 id="e251">A Strange Traveler at the Bottom of Tanzi Bay <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>(I am afraid of the authority of fate!)</p>
<p>In dreamlike emotions, I often float like a drifting ship in the lonely sea of people, wasting my unrecoverable youth so carelessly.</p>
<p>— Is wandering to forever restrict the brilliance of my life?</p>
<p>I ask this question, but no one answers it for me. I can only expect my own answer! However, I will never have an answer. Yes, my little boat of life sails in the stormy sea, and my boat lacks the rudder of life. How then will I answer my own question?</p>
<p>(In my small room, you will not find a calendar, because it is most likely to cause my sighs.)</p>
<p>I spend my days in a long nightmare, as easily as smoking a cigarette. Moreover, I am often moved east and west by modern transportation tools. I believe that my travels are not as accurate as the migration of migratory birds! However, I have no definite plan.</p>
<p>After spending the winter in a small mountain town, I came to this bustling seaside city with the spring. This is the second time I have used the muddy water of the Huangpu River for drinking.</p>
<p>The baton of fate drives me to enter the impoverished Tanzi Bay. I became a strange traveler at the bottom of Tanzi Bay without a specific destination.</p>
<p>(I should tell you: my residence is a small box with a small window on the east side, made of broken tinplate. The four walls of my small room are like original cardboard. Dust and cobwebs fill the corners. Don't be surprised. In Tanzi Bay, my small room is like a twenty-four-story building. Looking out from the small window, there are rows of thatched sheds. These houses are inhabited by families of manual laborers! Their souls are kind. You will believe my words, right!)</p>
<p>Every morning, the factory sirens respond to each other like madmen. They drag my soul back from dreams. Then, I jump out of bed and begin the day. This is how I finally settled down! The entire shape of Tanzi Bay, the faces of the residents of Tanzi Bay, and all their lifestyles are a bit too unfamiliar to me!</p>
<p>However, I am willing to slowly get to know them. I cannot bear the strange looks that Tanzi Bay throws at me. This is an insult to me.</p>
<p>(Isn't it? I am only wearing a worn-out blue cotton robe and walking on the small street back to my residence, but I see a group of ragged children casting mocking glances, making me feel for no reason that I am living in an environment where people do not understand each other. Yes! The people of Tanzi Bay despise long clothes. They believe that manual labor is the greatest, so they wear short clothes. The group of short-clothed people cannot tolerate a long-clothed person!)</p>
<p>Therefore, I carefully abandoned my inherent notions and began to observe the depths of the souls of Tanzi Bay. From its side profile, from its cross-section, I should understand Tanzi Bay. I believe that if Tanzi Bay is to understand me, it must first be through me understanding it.</p>
<p>As a result, I gradually understood Tanzi Bay. The name of the strange traveler at the bottom of Tanzi Bay has become a gracious epithet for my past life!</p>
<h3 id="e252">The Heaviest Burden! <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<h3 id="e253">Wayside <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Reaching the river dock, the small steamer had already sounded its horn for the third time. The porter carrying my luggage told me my cabin number. I said goodbye to my little brother and boarded the steamer. Because it was spring, merchants who had returned home for the New Year were now leaving their hometowns again. The small passenger cabin was crowded with passengers. I stood at the bow of the ship and waved to my little brother twice. The ship slowly pulled away from the shore. I watched my little companion holding the porter's hand—his figure disappearing into the pine forest—before squeezing into the cabin.</p>
<p>The water journey here is twenty li, and the small steamer makes a round trip once a day. Land travel is impossible. However, this small steamer often doesn't run for several days for lack of passengers. When I came from there, it was winter, and the cabin was just as crowded. They were carrying the fruits of their year-long hard work, returning to the warm "home" at the end of the year to enjoy family happiness. I had gained a three-month unexpected vacation to recuperate in the mountains. Wasn't a kind of joyful delight the same for both of us?</p>
<p>It was like a son who had fallen into a foreign land, once returning home, being caressed by motherly love—the moving hospitality of a friend's mother, and the companionship of my little friend alleviating my loneliness—one hundred days of life allowed the wounds in my blood to melt in the warmth of this cozy nest. I myself am a homeless wanderer, vaguely recalling the golden age of childhood in my dim memories. But these imagined joys are shattered like waves by the reality of life. Three months of cohabitation have rekindled my dim warmth. But now, I am being taken back to the cruel world by this small steamer! So I closed my eyes, as if trying to ward off the arrival of all unpleasant attacks, and slumped on the deck, isolating the world from myself.</p>
<p>I listened silently to the sound of the ship cutting through the water, loudly splattering as the engine churned. Sometimes, it seemed to roar as if unable to bear the pressure. Involuntarily, I opened my eyes to survey this real world: there were old men with long white beards hanging down, women with mournful faces, school-aged children who should be enjoying higher education, and perhaps others like me, homeless people. These people all had to complete the thirty-li water journey before flying off in various directions. "Why?" I asked myself. The splattering sound of the water answered me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to the passengers on the steamer coming here. When they were flying back to their warm nests, drunk on a joyful dream, perhaps they had cast all their pain behind them. But they had already anticipated the day when the steamer would carry them back out. "What is this for?" Is happiness and pain relative, or is happiness hidden behind pain?</p>
<p>The sound of the water at the stern of the ship grew louder. I glanced out the window. The small steamer had entered the official river. Orienting myself, I saw we were passing the Filial Daughter Temple. The scenery along the shore was familiar, like old acquaintances. It was as if I had jumped into a small boat, and the boatman was eagerly rowing, reaching the river dock of the Filial Daughter Temple. Isn't that the red wall of the Filial Daughter Temple, reflecting the brilliant sunlight? Aren't those the chimes coming, the morning chanting of the monks from the Filial Daughter Temple? Although the image of the Filial Daughter Temple initially shattered all the pleasant feelings of being secluded and otherworldly, the monks in the Filial Daughter Temple were all homeless people, just like the travelers on the steamer. They put on a serious face and didn't try to take money from the donors. This is not a crime; this is their strategy for survival. In the world around us, there are many who use improper means to deprive others of their right to exist!</p>
<p>Watching the Filial Daughter Temple fade away on the starboard side, I felt that a poignant story was hidden here! I felt that this red wall was lovely, I felt that this chanting was melodious. Yes, everything in the mountains is lovely. But this small steamer, with its splattering water sound, is heading in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Hotel <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>The sun, as big as a large bronze gong, with its egg-yolk-like color, finished its journey, and with a tired body, lazily drilled behind the rubber plantation to the west.</p>
<p>The heat on the earth had gradually dissipated. A gust of cool wind, light and clear, leaked from the tops of the rubber trees, kissing people's bodies and minds, as refreshing and cool as having eaten a cup of ice cream, making people forget the labor and heat of the day.</p>
<p>At this time, Yongxing Toujia, with his bulging belly, stood at the door of his hotel, facing the light evening breeze, leisurely and relaxed, watching the scaly red clouds in the blue sky and the tired crows returning to the forest, waiting for customers coming out of the rubber plantation.</p>
<p>Yongxing Toujia’s hotel was located on the right side of the rubber plantation, on a gentle slope about a dozen steps away from the rubber plantation. The scale of the shop was not large. The low-lying attap roof house was furnished with a dozen old and dilapidated tables. A row of "white wine" bottles was displayed high next to the counter, and some inexpensive snacks to go with the wine were placed on the counter, such as sardines, dried fish, green beans, and assorted salted pickles. His customers were those workers who came out of the rubber forest, their bodies dripping with foul sweat, and their faces as black as charcoal. Besides them, it was rare to see a passing stranger walking into his shop to drink three or five cups throughout the year.</p>
<p>When the sun reined in the power of its scorching flames every day, lazily hanging like an egg yolk on the top of the rubber trees, Yongxing Toujia would show a triumphant smile, standing at the door of his hotel, as if welcoming guests. Naturally, this was the time when the workers in the rubber plantation finished work. At the same time, his hotel’s business was just starting to get lively and energetic following the time when the workers in the plantation finished work.</p>
<p>"Ha, Mr. Kun Mengde, why haven't you come to my little shop for a few cups in the past few days? You must be very busy with 'life' recently…" Yongxing Toujia saw the foreman Kun Mengde, whose whole body was as black as charcoal and covered in needle-like tattoos, staggering out of the forest gate. He rushed</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>forward, grabbing his thick arm, and said in broken "foreign language". "Why, you look a little thinner after not seeing you for a few days, your complexion is really terrible, could it be that you can't sleep well at night? …Hehe!…"</p>
<p>The man called Kun Mengde seemed to ignore him, lowered his head, his heart seemed to be full of all kinds of worries, and slowly followed Yongxing Toujia into the hotel.</p>
<p>"Afu, get half a catty of 'white wine' for Mr. Kun Mengde, and a plate of dried fish… choose the fresh, big ones." After Yongxing Toujia ordered the shop assistant, he approached Kun Mengde's table and sat down. "This dried fish just arrived from Ganggu today, it's big and fresh, very suitable for your taste, Mr. Kun Mengde, I guarantee you won't want to leave after eating it." Yongxing Toujia said flatteringly, he knew that this man liked to eat dried fish the most.</p>
<p>"Uh…" that person casually grunted in his mouth, then remained silent like a wooden puppet.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kun Mengde, could it be that you got angry with your family today, why are you so unhappy?" Yongxing Toujia knew very well that Kun Mengde was an extremely cheerful person. Jokes from his mouth were like the flowing water in the Chao Phraya River, gushing endlessly. But such a silent attitude today was something that Yongxing Toujia had never seen in the twenty-odd years he had known him. As a result, Yongxing Toujia also felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>"Yongxing Toujia, I'm afraid your business won't last long…" After a while, Kun Mengde finally opened his mouth, stretching his hoarse voice as if with great effort. "The 'boss' of the rubber plantation doesn't want to do this business anymore… you know, the rubber business has been losing money severely for the past few years, putting his thousands of dollars of family property into it. Now, 'Shanding' is strictly restricting rubber exports, causing a lot of rubber to be unsellable and piled up in the warehouse. But recently, they are going to levy some kind of 'business tax', which really makes the 'boss' feel disheartened—now, the 'boss' has decided to close down the rubber plantation in the near future…" He filled a cup of "white wine" and gulped it down his throat with a "gulp," then poured another cup.</p>
<p>Yongxing Toujia was a little dazed at this time. His head felt heavy and dizzy as if he were drunk, and his eyes stared motionlessly at Kun Mengde's red eyes, unable to say a word. His heart was tightly entangled in a web of worries. He thought: "After the rubber plantation closes, where will this hotel—the hotel that supports my family—relocate to?"</p>

<p>— Wei Mang</p>
<p>When flowers fall, spring has returned!</p>
<p>With a sense of despondency and disillusionment, I stand forlornly before the lonely peach tree.</p>
<p>Am I dreaming of the spring that has passed? Spring has returned!</p>
<p>Is spring the mystery of youth, the dream of humanity? In spring, the heart of youth is overwhelmed with pain. But when spring leaves, and the falling red turns to mud, the heart of youth aches as if it has been stabbed!</p>
<p>— Spring, the season of love; when spring leaves, love also leaves with it!</p>
<p>Thinking of the past, how can I not shed tears of sorrow?</p>
<p>A time of light sorrow and vexing falling flowers!</p>
<h3 id="e256">Life <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Zhi</p>
<p>The slight wind in the spring night, blowing across a flushed face with a hint of alcohol, sweeps across this midnight road. Piercing through thousands of pores, it feels as cool as if it were blowing from an air conditioner. The hot air, filled with a strong smell, that escapes from the mouth, rushes into the nostrils with the light wind. The waves of unbearable alcohol press so hard that even breathing feels stifled and painful.</p>
<p>Tired and dazed eyes are slightly open, and everything in sight seems to be dancing a quick waltz, spinning. The head already feels uncomfortably heavy. However, in the chaotic vision, although the magnificent and luxurious hall has disappeared, and the scene of red lights and green shadows has vanished, her face, an oval one that is already haggard, still flickers on and off in the eyelids.</p>
<p>Before two o'clock, as soon as I entered that magnificent and luxurious hall, Mu discovered her sitting in that row of women’s seats. When Mu told me, I suddenly felt a tightening in my head, and the blood flow seemed to be stung by the sound of gunfire, spinning rapidly. I didn't dare to look at her, but her haggard face had already been deeply imprinted in my mind. Her phantom, which had been fading in my memory, intensified its power and threatened my nerves. I was completely immersed in the dream scene of deep thought.</p>
<p>It was a year ago! It was a summer evening, and the stuffy air oppressed my breathing. In the middle of the night, I suddenly woke up. Everything on earth was immersed in a sea of stillness. The house was pitch black, and the dim yellow light from the gas lamp at the corner of the alley seemed exceptionally bright at that time. I leaned against the window, peering out at the urban scene in the dark night. Suddenly, the face of a young woman appeared before my eyes. She lived opposite my window. At that time, she was already very tired from returning from that magnificent hall.</p>
<p>Since that night, she had caught my attention. I was trying hard to find out her background and name. This motive for curious inquiry arose because I discovered that she was still working hard to study when she was resting. I really wanted to understand, since she was already an unfortunate woman in the city, spending her life all night in that luxurious and magnificent den of exchanging wine and meat, what kind of mood could she still have to work hard?</p>
<p>However, my curiosity finally disappointed me. Before finding out, I had already left that house. From then on, I had no longer seen her, and her image had gradually faded in my memory and was about to disappear.</p>
<p>But tonight, she appeared before my eyes again. Her impression on me was emphasized again in my mind. However, tonight she was not the her of a year ago, not the life of an unfortunate woman that I wanted to inquire about. However, the impression she gave me tonight was deeper than before. From her face, I could see that she was haggard because of life.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Grand Opening Ceremony of Cultural Film Company <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The up-and-coming Cultural Film Company held its opening ceremony at midnight yesterday. About two to three hundred people from all walks of life participated in the company's opening ceremony. Celebrities in Shanghai such as Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Yonglin, and Zhang Weiru also participated. The first scene filmed that night was a stage scene, namely the "Jiangnan Drought Relief Entertainment Gala" in the play. In order to be realistic in the play, Mr. Wang Xiaolai was invited to give a speech, and Mr. Cai Diaotu, a reporter from the Social Evening News, was responsible for recording. Mr. Wang Xiaolai's speech was very poignant and moving. Mr. Wang Xiaolai said: "Floods occur in one line, droughts occur everywhere, so droughts are actually more harmful than floods... To be honest, the compatriots in the disaster areas now have no clothes or food, and are suffering from hunger and cold. Please, gentlemen, transfer the cost of smoking cigarettes to help the victims..." Everyone who heard this was moved.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang Xiaolai's speech, the company's debut work, "Parents and Children," the first program of the entertainment gala in the play, "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold," was filmed. The richness of the stage scene in "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold" is rare in domestic films. The singers and dancers performing in the play have undergone long-term training before filming, so the various dance postures performed are extremely exquisite and unparalleled. It is said that the dance was taught by a famous European dancer, and the accompaniment was also by a famous foreign orchestra in Shanghai. The lead actress is the nationally renowned singer and dance star Gong Qiuxia.</p>
<h3 id="e261">"Grace of a Beauty" Successfully Completed <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>"Grace of a Beauty" is a famous work by Zhang Henshui. Tianyi Company put it on the screen, directed by Wen Yimin, starring Lu Lixia, Li Ying, Wei Pengfei, Zhang Zhenduo, Shen Yalen, Zhao Xiaofo, Xiao Zhengzhong, Tian Taixuan and other male and female stars. In addition, there are dozens of first-class singers from the "Mingyue" and "Xinhua" dance troupes, Bai Hong, Li Mingjian, Yan Fei, Zhou Xuan, and Xu Jian participating in the performance, which is the perfect combination and like icing on the cake.</p>
<p>The film was shot two months ago, but because of the insertion of subtitles, the addition of music and singing, the work was extremely complicated, so it was not until recently that all the merits were completed. It is expected that it will be sent to Beijing for review within a few days, and the public release period will also be in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Difficulty of Producing the Mother Script <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>The preliminary review of "Mother" has already passed. Although the re-review script has been printed, Mr. Shao Cunren and directors Wen Yimin, Gao Lihen, and Gao Tianqi discussed at the production meeting and believed that there were still inevitable shortcomings. In order to improve the script, it still needs to be revised. Therefore, Mr. Gao Tianqi has been responsible for the revision, reprinting, and submitting it for review.</p>
