<p>自政府管理通貨。集中現金。迄今巳有四日。在過去三日中。市塲雖仍見不安。然已無未宣布前之憧恐擾攘。蓋金融漸趨於安定矣。惟一般家庭生活。頓覺「洋價短。物價高」。此固一時現象。有改革不能無痛苦。經過一番變動。進而謀產業復與。物價安定。生活有向上之樂。則忍須臾之痛苦何礙。但如物價上騰。購買力不能隨之俱進。轉以騰貴之結果。購買更形無力。亦滋可慮。或謂此必無之事。物價上漲。生產發達。購買力寗有不促進之理。要知在多數祗圖享用不事生產之中國人民。此種不幸現象之發生。亦頗有可能性也。此後設祗以扶助地產事業。為金融活動之樞紐。則於產業復興全般問題上。究有幾何利益。實屬疑問。萬一地產投機。死灰復然。其听加惠於工商業者何。如固不難由回憶而推知也。</p>
<p>雖然。我國金融循是以往。無大變化。匯價平準。物價安定。外匯之投機减少。正當事業之資金有着。一切未始不可漸入正軌。惟此尙有待於極大之努力耳。</p>
<p>中國幅員廣大。一種改革之成功。非如各國之易易。然無外力之破壞。終必有成功之一日。英商銀行已奉其政府之命。與我合作。美國政府雖不願表示是否將勸令在華美僑。與中國政府合作。但已表明繼續以前美國對華之諾言。竭力避免妨害中國政府最近穩定幣價之方法。不願在此時期。擾亂世界之銀價。可知美國至少已願為間接之合作矣。惟日本尙無明確表示。果如其使館所傳。日政昨對於在華之日商銀行。是否與我合作。將取消極態度。不願保障。則此乃大可扼腕者。蓋中日正謀親善。中國正當之改革。日本理應加以援助。况匯價安定。於兩國貿易為有利。奈何猶懷偏狹之見解。作獨占之企圖。而以日匯一百三四十元落至一百零三元。致心懷不安歟。</p>
<p>現銀未集中之前。津沽烟靑濟南滬厦各地。走私頗盛。照倫敦之銀價。現一元之値仍在面値。六成以上。大利所在。難保不作有組織之販運。此固大有妨於我現銀集中者也。今艱巨之工作。正加於我國人之肩上。人方以我能否排萬難。袪危疑。保信用。為推察我國貨幣前途之標準。我人安可沾沾自喜而不知有以自勉耶。</p>
<h3>英意繼續商討　緩和地中海局勢</h3>
<p>羅馬發表公報談話友好　意撤軍以英撤艦爲條件</p>
<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼於午後延見英國大使德魯蒙爵士、事後發表正式公報、謂兩人會見係討論地中海之英意局勢、據本社訪員所知、兩人曾研究如何改善兩國間之關係、當經德魯蒙要求意國繼續撤退駐利比亞軍隊、此外二人對於未來倫敦海軍會議、亦曾加以討論、而於地中海新海軍均勢之基礎、則尤為注重、據半官式人士所稱、墨索里尼曾向德魯蒙申說、意國業將利比亞軍隊撤退一師、而德魯蒙則說明英國仍以不减少地中海軍艦之理由云、一般人士對於談話均感良好印象、政界方面指出意相與英使迭次會晤、在外表上雖並未獲得具體結果、然其能使意阿爭端局勢獲有進步、則必然之事也、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼與英大使德魯蒙今日續談地中海時局事、仍無結果、據公報稱、墨氏言及意國撤回利比亞意兵一師事後、德魯蒙表示英政府對於意國此舉之欽佩、但謂意國駐利比亞之軍隊較諸埃及境內之英埃軍隊現仍約多三倍、故英政府認此局勢尙未許地中海英艦隊之撤除、英艦隊之存在地中海、純為戒備而已云、此次談話尙屬友好、但意國方面發言人不作過分之樂觀、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>意相主擴大談話範圍　要求地中海海軍均勢</p>
<p>（倫敦）聞意相墨索里尼與英國大使德魯蒙爵士本日右羅馬會見時、曾討論緩和地中海緊張局勢所可採取之步驟、關於此層、據消息靈通人士說明、意國報紙若仍繼續作反英宣傳、該國駐利比西軍隊若不再撤退一師、則英國决不减少地中海軍艦之數額、但意國若能照辦、則英國不僅擬將「霍特」號及「雷囊」號兩大戰艦召回本國或尙將調回巡洋艦及魚雷艇一隊、亦未可知、傳聞意相墨索里尼擬擴大談話範圍、而將地中海海軍均勢問題提出討論、關於此事、官塲方面申說、目前唯一問題、係在恢復菲洲和平、他非所問、至英意兩國海軍專家雖定於明日開始談話、但其性質、亦當嚴格限於籌備十二月二日舉行之海軍會議云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>意允再撤利比亞駐軍　英法合作談判有進展</p>
<p>（倫敦）據每日郵報與每日快報兩報所知、關於英意兩國所爭之撤軍事宜、倘意國應允减少利比亞駐軍軍額、則英國駐泊地中海之海軍、是否有撤退戰艦兩艘、乃至不止此數之可能、昨日鮑爾溫首相曾邀集若干閣僚、有所討論、又據新聞紀事報載稱、意相墨索里尼業已接受再將利比亞駐軍撤退兩師、連前撤退之數、共為三萬員名、但以英國調回在地中海所駐戰艦數艘為條件、關於此事、晨郵報以為英國對於减少地中海軍艦數額之間題、非俟海軍合作問題與法國獲得完全妥協而後、殆不能加以考慮、按合作問題、日前由法國海軍專家德古提督與婁士上校來英討論、業已大有進展、現僅餘數點尙未解决、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英懷抱三種畏懼心理　運用策略以離間意法</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間官方人士宣稱、英意兩國目下在國聯會以外進行之談判、其主要目的不在解决意阿爭端、而在解决地中海之困難局勢、此間某要人頃並向哈瓦斯社記者發表意見、謂「意阿爭端發生後、英國政府對意國探取空前之嚴峻態度、此實由於英國挾有三種畏懼心理之所致、一則深恐意大利在阿比西尼亞得手後、將在英埃蘇丹及英屬法尼亞與紅海之間、編練阿國軍隊五十萬員名、使成為菲洲最强大之軍隊、二則恐意國海軍日見發展、三則恐法意兩國友好日益增進、以致危及英國、有此三種畏懼、故英國督促國聯會探取最堅强之行動、以防止意國勢力伸入阿國、且意國始終相信、英國本意實欲採取軍事制裁手段、蓋英國以為惟有用海軍壓迫意國、方可使英國三種畏懼心理完全消解、嗣後因軍事制裁政策未獲各國同意、致遭失敗、英國乃轉而進行談判、以冀在造成地中海均勢與離間法意關係之兩點上、覓求補償辦法云、據本社訪員所知、英國政府目前確在進行上述政策、英意兩國對於地中海問題如能獲得妥協、則阿比西尼亞問題當不難迎刃而解矣、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英海軍擬在地中海　建立新根據地　英意專家倫敦舉行談話　爲未來海軍會議之準備</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據講壇報駐英訪員探悉、英國海軍部擬與意國海軍專家商議、建立地中海英國海軍根據地之新系統、保護蘇彝士運河與摩蘇爾煤油管、以防萬一之事變、目前英國海軍在地中海係以直布羅陀海峽與瑪爾泰島為主要根據地、與新加坡均相距甚遠、按照所擬之新系統、則英國艦隊可在地中海東部集中、與新加坡距離較近、據該訪員聲稱、英國海軍現巳在蘇彝士運河及紅海附近如貝林島等處、建造新根據地、故上項計畫殆巳在實行中云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意國海軍專家卽海軍少將皮西亞與艦長馬谷蒂尼、業於今晚抵此、將與英國專家舉行談話、俾作未來海軍會議之準備、官方人士申說、此項談話與目前地中海形勢絕對無關云（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯經濟制裁小組委員會、今日通過議案、規定十一月十八日起、將以鋼鐵油煤四物亦列入對意禁運之主要物產表中、惟須德美合作、該案係加拿大代表今日在會議中提出、當時智利代表加以反對、稱為不能實行、此間多數外交家稱、美國法律不能禁止此四項物品出口、且國聯如通過此項議案、實為自討美國之拒絕、惟贊成該案者信意國飛機或可因缺乏汽油而不能飛行、故亦不妨一試、且意國之坦克車亦將因無油而不能前進、意船亦將因無煤而不能開行、各種軍火工業亦將因無鋼鐵而致停頓、蓋意國之戰爭機械全恃他國供給原料也、（五日國民社電）</p>

<h3>禁運石油計畫　英國異常重視　認爲非美德合作不爲功</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此問政界人士對於國聯會對意禁運石油之計畫、加以十分重視、查一九三四年度、意國鍊油消費量、達四十二萬二千公担、瓦斯油消費量達二十二萬六千公担、潤機油消費量達二十五萬一千公担、汽油消費量、達一百六十三萬公担、自軍與以來、各種石油消費量、尤見倍增、倘欲斷絕意國石油來源、非美國禁止運油不爲功、但除對意實施封鎖、使美國石油不能運入外、美國是否願意參加禁運、殊成疑問、卽令美國參加禁運、他國運入煤油、取道奧國、以入意境、（因奧國並未參加製裁）如是則對意禁運煤奧國並未參加制裁）如是則對意禁運媒油、恐難收効、此外阿爾巴尼亞國每給意國原油約近五十萬公担、其質羅馬尼亞所產者相等、意國煤油公司享有阿爾巴尼亞國西塞斯塞拉尼加與狄伏里兩處之油井讓與權、其所產之油、則由長七十公里之油管、通至伏羅號附近之亞德里亞海岸、轉運意國云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>阿京　此間若干官員今日聲稱、阿國以前雖曾表示對於意軍進攻、擬不加抵抗、惟瑪加爾仍將固守云、以阿國陸軍部之計畫觀之、防軍將不致以全力抵抗、因瑪加爾實際上並不重要、故阿軍將候至較為衝要之地點、再决一勝負、阿國如略為抵抗、顯係欲使竭力主張公開戰爭之酋長稍平怒氣而已、太子瑪康能大槪將於二三日內由台西抵此、其後阿皇卽將親赴北路前綫、（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>英美觀察　中國通貨穩定　加入英鎊集團不免過早</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間金融界對於中國國幣貶價百分之四十之一舉、甚表贊成、以為貶價百分之四十、適與英國廢棄金本位後、英鎊貶價之比率相同、若干人士以為中國貨幣貶價後、將加入鎊幣集團、但目前作此種解釋、似尙不免過早、一般人以為南京政府此次所採取之决定、係本諸數年來大多數國家之貨幣經騐、其用意首在保護國內存銀、次在創造健全穩固之貨幣組織、復次則在保護中國經濟、以免受外國之競爭、至於加入英鎊集團與否、則尙未計及於此云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日滿軍侵入俄境　蘇俄對日抗議全文</h3>
<p>滿洲防務全由關東軍執行　日政府不能推卸糾紛責任</p>
<p>（莫斯科）十月十二十四兩日、蘇聯駐日一大使優列湼夫對於滿洲武裝軍隊於十月六日八日及十二日在格羅德科伏區侵入蘇聯國境事、先後向日廣田外相抗議、二十五日廣田提出覆文、十一月四日優氏復向廣田提覺書如下、</p>
<p>「閣下備忘錄所提、蘇聯邊防巡衛隊於十月六日及十二日衝突中曾有非法行為、此點全然無根、故蘇聯政府須加拒絕、余於十月十六及十四兩次學書內、早經聲明、此等衝突均發生於蘇聯境內、其起因為日滿武裝隊伍非法侵入蘇境、同時向蘇聯邊防巡衛隊襲擊、閣下十月二十五日備忘錄、對於此等事端發生於蘇聯境內一點、亦未否認、</p>
<p>「閣下復稱、日滿武裝隊伍在出事地點出現、目的僅在調查、此點亦非拒斥不可、因日滿軍隊絕無在蘇聯境內從事調查之權利也、又蘇聯巡衛未發警吿、卽向日滿軍隊開槍云云、亦非事實、蓋蘇聯第一隊巡衛隊有騎兵二人先向侵入蘇境之日滿部隊警告、後者非唯不離蘇境、且向蘇聯邊防衛兵開槍、衛兵科推尼科夫身死、其餘二人受傷、在此塲合、蘇聯衛兵自應遵照服務規程、向侵入國境並向彼等襲擊之日滿軍隊開槍、故閣下對於蘇聯邊防衛兵行為反作抗議，乃絕無根據、蘇聯政府於出事之初、明知資在日滿方面、唯仍設法令日本政府深信此項事實、故建議兩國應卽各推代表、組織混合委員會、赴肇事地點澈查、蘇聯政府對此不得不表遺憾、因日本政府以為可無須由混合委員會從事調查、實際言之、此項方法實為不偏不依、證明事實之最佳保證余受蘇聯政府之命、向閣下提醒、日本政府對於八月十七日余所提交之組織蘇滿邊境混合委員會之草案、迄今仍未答覆、此項建議確能提出一種切實辦法、迅速調查類於十月十二日衝突之邊境糾紛、同時得令此項破壞邊境安靜和平之糾紛、不再發生焉、</p>
<p>閣閣下復稱、此類糾紛原因乃在蘇滿境界劃分不淸、此點亦全非事實、蓋蘇滿邊境早經中俄兩國簽約議定、並附地圖說明、滿國成立之際、宣稱此類條約仍須遵守、此等條約所訂定之境界不能有所懷疑、當日本軍隊未入滿洲之前、此類糾紛從未發生、</p>
<p>「最後日本政府以為此事須向滿國政府理直、蘇聯政府對於此點不能不表　異、蘇聯政府已一再喚起日本政府注意、日本政府關於日滿當局對於蘇聯有所行動、則决不能推卸責任、因滿洲軍事佈防全由日本執行、而關東軍者適爲滿州之統治者也、同時蘇滿邊境糾紛、如有何種後果、對於蘇日關係顯有直接影響、此外在此事件內、正如閣下所稱、日滿軍隊內有日本士兵參加此項衝突、僅就此點而論、日本應為此項事變之一員、同時閣下本人認蘇方無端向日滿軍隊開槍、應予抗議一節、亦足證明日本初未能自外於此事件也、由此種種、蘇聯政府認其於十月二十四日所提抗議完全合理云、（五日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>種族關係上意阿戰爭的意義</h3>
<p>— 恩霖</p>
<p>意大利已經不顧一切，向阿比西尼亞進攻了·阿比西尼亞也以傾國的力量抵禦着·當然，這不僅是黑衣宰相墨索里尼和阿皇海利塞拉西利，兩個人的鬥法？這戰爭還包含着種族關係和經濟關係上的意義·黑人杜博愛士（W．E．B．Du　Bois）就這種族關係，撰有一篇論文。大要可分為兩點：（一）意大利為什麼不顧一切，硬要估據阿比西尼亞。（二）全世界有色種人從這件事情可以得到怎樣的敎訓。原文大實如下。　（一）</p>
<p>中古時代，本沒有眞正的所謂種族問題。關於人類的研究和討論，祗限於國籍，文化，和宗敎罷了。後來有一部份人口繫殖的民族，謀向外發展，需要一班做苦工的，來做他們開拓殖民的工具，於是販運奴隸，成了一種專門行業。販奴的風氣到處盛行起來，而在美洲新大陸，　遇到了種種阻力。第一是思想純正的人士，對於販奴制度非常反對；其次是德謨克拉西運動的發揚，把工人地位提高。表面上，販奴和運奴這兩件事，在那裏好像吿一段落，其實這祇是白人的一套戲法，來個換湯不換藥罷了。至於歐洲的帝國主義國家，則把他們的菲洲領土做了一個大棧房，在那里轉運着許多奴隸。等到十九世紀，白人變更方法，羊毛出在羊身上，索性大量地移殖菲洲黑人，去開拓菲洲本土。在這種情形之下，如果歐洲人和他們的領屬土人，文化智識程度不相上下的話，那末也不至於發生什麽種族問題了。可是在歐洲人思想中，種族上有貴賤的不同，開拓領土是必需而正當的；並目事實上這給予了他們非常的厚利，弄得大家欲罷不能。日耳曼，比利時，和意大利，看見別國弄到了殖民領土後，收進了許多利益，自然不勝其眼紅，也要四面想法子，來增光門楣。他們的確早巳感覺到，如果要踏上近代工業主義的途徑，祇有這樣辦，否則就等死。</p>
<p>亞細亞，南美洲，和菲洲，都是開着門給歐洲人開拓的地方，不過開拓的方法，各有巧妙不同。亞洲是文化之源，可以算得簪纓世家，不容許歐洲人用直接的政治勢力來統轄，他們祇好用投資的方式，來做經濟侵略的先導。不過在大戰之前，日本却能單獨逃出了歐人的主宰。南美洲托庇在門羅主義的蔭下，沒有受到歐洲政治勢力的干涉，但是在那里的統治階級白人，受盡了印第安人的侍奉，種族上的區別，雖沒有像亞洲和菲洲的壁壘深嚴，可是也涇渭分明。至於在菲洲和西印度，白人不過統制土着的勞工，給予低微的工資，而在政治上並無什麼設施，敎育或工業上，也不給牠們以訓練機會。總之一句話，只要從這苦工階級榨取最肥厚的利益就是了。</p>
<p>歐洲人堅持了種族觀念，從事於經濟的開拓之外，又在領屬的土人之中，利用基督敎的幌子，來做他們別具隻眼的工作。這樣的雙管齊下，便成了近代一種不可恩議的奇象。譬如說基督敎對於菲洲和南美黑人的文化建設，着實有些貢獻，即衽亞洲也有若干的影響。但是在另一方面，實業和經濟的開拓上，又無疑地，連續利用基督敎作為烟幕，使得土人順服，沒有革命的異志。有時候傳敎徒雖被利用，可是自己始終沒有明白，在那齣戲中是做着什麼脚色。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>上面所講的多半為大戰前的情形。戰後世界的人種關係便起了一重劇烈變化，可以說是種族思想上的一種革命。日本除了逃避歐洲人的宰割之外，在世界的列强中又仲出了一隻新的手來，從此白人不能逞意的統治世界，也要和漸漸抬頭，而踏到自由之途的有色人種，分庭抗禮了。譬如，中國現方進展到她新秩序的途徑上去，一旦擺脫了目下的分娩痛苦之後，便要脫離白種人的制宰，成為一個自主的國家，這是誰都承認的。此外如印度，海地，里比亞等，也都漸次擺脫東縛，不難還她們的本來面目。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞向來所受的束縛，比較輕鬆，政治上的自主力量，也有相當的大，並且巳開始改變她的陳舊政策，就各方面看起來，這一個沒有被近代開拓主義者，和種族偏狹觀念者染指的黑種族，前途很有希望。可惜不凑巧得很，這個美滿的好夢，被那鐵腕宰相統治下的意大利驚破了。因為她不是一個工業國家，而且還保持着蓄奴制度，意大利便把阿比西尼亞看作未開化的蠻族。要知道阿比西尼亞所存在的奴隸制度，和販奴及現代工業主義的開拓領土是絕不相同的。意大利公然主張剝奪這些菲洲人的居土，這種方法常為斷絕他們經濟上和政治上後援的初步手段。其實意大利人此舉，是效法他們的前輩英，法，　的。</p>
<p>這些國家最先在菲洲樹立經濟力量，開門第一砲就是這個方法。不過在多數塲合，用合法的幌子，巧妙地遮蔽着罷了。像目下意大利老着臉，公開地喊着：她為了自己的佃農，她要阿比西尼亞的土地，到眞是少見的！</p>
<p>大戰的主因，為了有幾個國家要插足於菲洲領土的開拓，是很少疑義的，而這里呢，却又埋下了另外一個火種。在戰前，德國在亞洲和小亞細亞，都有她的經濟立足點，而且前途很有希望。但是她對於菲洲却不滿意；她為了喪失烏干達而抱憾，因為開拓上尼羅河流域的均等機會是失去了，她無疑地，遲早要主張比利時放棄剛果，並且不願使法蘭西獨羈却特湖和奈遮上流流域。她要完成這幾種主張，便是她歡迎戰爭的主因之一。</p>
<p>現在大家又有些把舊調重彈的樣子。德國决計要恢復他的屬領，意大利又决計要英法履行一九一五年倫教條約，所給予意大利的諾言。為了這一點，德意氣味相投，莫索里尼和希特勒便如膠如漆，扭着在一起，可是美竟不常，中途突生變化，為了德人企圖佔據奧地利亞，無端把這些計劃打破了。德人此舉把法意嚇得一跳，不由地兩方面便手灣手兒要好起來，結果呢法蘭西對於意大利的開拓東菲，不再加以反對。不過意大利如果操刀硬割了人家一磅肉，有誰敢担保德國不要原版重刻一下麽？此外還有別的顧忌在！阿拉伯人為了意大利攫奪鐵里甫黎和息里內易卡，會經把阿民大加屠殺，至今恨之切骨。日本在阿比西尼亞的市塲，貿易數額不在少數，而印度人在東菲的做賣買，又是無孔不入的。菲洲的白人開拓者對於亞洲人，向來不許他們來染指，現在却被這些東方勢力滲雜進去，在政治主權和人民自由等問題上巳起了個劇烈變化了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>意大利如果一面不惜工本，用大量的軍火去攻打阿國，一面和歐洲各國間的禮讓，仍舊保持着，那末意大利的戰勝阿比西尼亞，也許是可能的。如果此言而中，意大利和白人間為了這個勝利，其所付的代價是非常大的。凡是有色人種—中國·印度·日本·菲洲·和美國的菲洲人，曾經感覺到壓迫和凌侮的，會被白人奴視和侵略的—都要心裏想：「我早就說過了！他們是不講信義的，連同伴中也是如此。他們不信基督的道理，他們决不會自動地認識人類的生要質素，或者放棄那祇為私利而想統治大多數人的令頭。要求自由和平等，祇有靠力量，靠極大的力量。」</p>
<p>我們現在且不管刀光血影的可怕景象，如果我們預期着阿比西亞竟能够抗拒意大利的進攻，或者經過幾個月的時期不分勝負。這種想像在目下看起來好似難能，但是可以的。那末結果將要怎樣呢？黑人國裏便要奏着毛骨悚然的音樂歡呼道：「歐洲人的束縛破除了，這是結局的開端，白種人再不能靠着他們的暴力，來把黃種人，黑種人，棕色人做他們的農奴」。這個見解近於幻想，而且也太覺過分了，歐洲人和白種人對於多靈敏人的敎化的貢獻，似也不能一筆抹煞。不過這種理解實是無可避免的</p>
<p>意大利這一次戰事，無論是贏或是輸，他巳經把全世界推到一條岔路上，就是人種間的嫉視，從此將格外深刻化；如果意大利戰不得手而敗的話，那末白人世界的威名就要受到一個嚴重的打擊，好像俄國被日本戰敗時一樣。</p>
<p>現在世界各地的有色種人，除了日本是驕子之外，其餘像黑人，棕色種人漸漸地自覺着在抬頭了。日本人更仿照了歐洲白人的方式，用軍事力量，和商業的經濟力量向外開拓。意大利在這時候，却不顧一切的給人家一個可怕的印象。雖然她是天主敎的中心，現代文化文藝復與的家鄉，她却率直地說：我們要征服一個低級的民族，不是為了他們，乃是為了我們自己的利益。我們要去拿阿比西尼亞，正和我們取索馬利蘭，和英國取拿甘亞一般。我們要把黑人弄成沒有田地的農奴。因為我們有力量做這件事，而沒有一個白人國敢，沒有有色種人國能，阻止我們。所以由黑人看起來，在這種論調之下，如果有色種國要維持他們自身，則對白歐希冀什麽，訴諸宗敎和文化，都是沒有用的，唯一的出路便是實力。世界上弱小國家，和有色人種，對於意阿糾紛，祇有忍氣呑聲，等待着罷了。全世界，或世界的任何一部份，為什麽不能阻止這個大攪擾呢？我們所能明白的，就是其餘各國的行徑，也和意大利一式無二！</p>

<p>鄭洪年氏　發表意見</p>
<p>民國十九年間、美國因銀價過賤、有意借給我國十萬萬盎期白銀、當時如進行接受、拿來做基礎、並進一步向生產白銀國家訂約收買、使中國爲世界銀市塲、這二年來的金融恐慌風潮、便不至發生、去年十月間、政府下令徵收銀出口稅及平衡稅、其補救漏出亦甚微、現在財政當局、毅然實行統一幣制政策、杜絕白銀外流、這是我國經濟起死回生的惟一樞紐、此舉至爲適應我國現狀、惟對旅行辦法、須切實顧到各方面、據個人意見、（一）政府應切實使全國民衆明瞭此項政策、不是通貨膨脹、最要的務使窮鄕僻壤、都能明瞭、此須責由各區村長負責曉喻、因民間雖無大批現銀可以窖藏、但少數當然是有的、故須曉喻、以免將來不良份子、藉此原故、發生騷擾、（二）關於準備管理委員會的組織、由金融界領袖參加、我固贊同、但金融界領袖、有時决不能不着重本身利益、故同時須有其他各界領袖參加、如自由職業的律師·會計師·經濟專家、敎育界等領袖、均應使之參加、至銀行所在各地方、亦應設立準備分庫、使民衆就近知曉、亦須有此類領袖參加、此外尙有兩點、即（甲）須組織一審査委員會、其人選照上述、每週須嚴査一次、由其公佈、此因我國人民程度不齊、徵信方法、須格外眞確、（乙）準備庫除現金及有價證券外、地產亦可列入、惟須規定一律成分、相信地產必漲價、以免將來有所影響（三）統制國際貿易、政府爲使國幣滙價穩定、對外滙爲無限制之購售、固是甚對、但商人往往不免藉此投機、政府應同時統制國際貿易、對需要貨物、由政府躉購、售與商人、（四）統制銅幣、我國人民生活程度過低、（現在尙有每月一元餘過活者）銅元是無法可以廢去、但對各地銅元的需要、應有切實統計、務祈供求相應、由政府規定法價、交由各地銀錢莊流通、不許收藏、因中國此時銅少、如任由收藏、必發生恐慌、此層須先顧慮到、記得民國紀元前三十二年間、因銅幣缺少、寗鄂曾發生極大恐慌、後趕加鑄、銅價飛漲、庫欵吃虧不少、近來世界及本國所發生情形、我國遠近歷史、均有相當專例可稽、對此點所以不能不先事預防、各經濟專家、巳發有極好意見、我不再多談、惟望全國從事實上研究適當辦法、上下一心一德、與政府聯爲一體、以挽救經濟危機、</p>

<p>政府於十一月三日公佈幣制改革六條、其大意第一、以中央中國交通三行紙幣爲法幣、第二、其他發行銀行之紙幣、照舊行使、惟以截至十一日三日流通之總額爲限、不得增發、由財部酌定限期、遂漸以中央鈔票換回、第三、設立發行準備管理委員會、集中銀準備之保管、第四、自十一月四日起、銀幣不准流通、應立即兌換法幣行使、第五、銀幣單位訂定之契約、槪以法幣結算收付、第六、穩定外滙價格、由中中交三行無限制買賣外滙、懿　盛哉、斯誠爲中國金融制度步入世界金融演進最新階叚之起始也、如此規定、其對於中國今後金融史上之地位、等於一八四四年英之庇爾條例、Pelu　ac一八四八年之法蘭西銀行紙幣條例、對於英法金融史上所造成之偉績、窺情論勢、我政府三日所公布之幣制法案將來之結果、且尤過之、蓋自一八三三年英政府正式規定英格蘭銀行紙幣爲法幣後、銀行紙幣之得爲法幣、遂立其基、十九世紀初葉、拿破崙戰事以後、英格蘭曾繼之發生金融恐慌、當時政府爲應付現金支付之局面起見、即規定英格蘭銀行鈔票爲法幣、代替各其他發行銀行之紙幣流通、施行之後、成效大著、一八四八年後之法國、一八七五年後之德國、相繼行之、歐洲大戰以後、舉世幣制發生空前變動、近十五年來歐美各國、若英·若美·若法·若意·若德等、市塲流通、無不以中央銀行紙幣爲法幣、金屬貨幣、除輔幣外、無有行使者、美之美金、英之金鎊、法之法郞、德之馬克、意之里拉、即在金本位未放棄以前、其有以金幣行使者否、曰無有也、市塲流通、盡爲紙幣、所有金幣及金貨、完全集中中央銀行、除爲抵補國際收支華額起見、運用黄金外、國內無有本位幣之流通、即或兌現、而亦規定兌現之最低額、如法蘭西銀行之紙幣兌現、最低限額尙在二十一萬法郞以上是、如是、則對內用以金貨作準備之紙幣而對外則以金貨作國際債務償還之用、此最近歐美各國幣制運用之準則也、究其功用、則市塲通貨、可以自由伸縮、物價水準、可以設法控制、而國家經濟亦可藉通貨管理之法、而大現其效能、世有以通貨政策、作爲經濟恐慌之方略者、即是理也、我國幣制在最近法案公佈以前、實爲一朱上軌道之貨幣制度、紙幣發行分散、市塲貨幣、仍以金屬本位幣行使自美國提高銀價以後、其弱點愈著、銀貨流出、防不勝防、而市塲籌碼復無集中管理之機關、其不能以通貨政業、調整金融節季、控制物價水準之變動也明矣、今我政府毅然乾綱獨斷、規定以三行紙幣爲法幣、銀質本位幣不准流通、發行銀行準備集中管理、並載明其他　行銀行之鈔票、由財部限期、以中央紙幣換回、其與歐美各國最新之貨幣制度、完全相同、將來有裨於吾國經濟之發展、豈淺鮮哉、此法公布以後、舉世稱譽、然國人尙有誤解之點二、第一、物價是否因之而上漲、曰、物價不必因新貨幣法案而上漲、最近兩天物價之渦度上漲者、人心浮動、與不明白貨幣原理之漲、往往由於貨幣之膨脹、然最後政府當局一再明言、通貨決不膨脹也、通貨不膨脹、則物價不致隨便上漲、然則我國最近物價、以後决不上漲否、日、可以上漲、而使經濟繁樂、但其上漲之原因、可以由於下列兩點、第一、因通貨制度之改　、市面籌碼、可以得合理之流通、信用不致停滯、而社會購買力得以增加、生產銷路、可以大增、物價因之而逐漸恢復常態、於是間接足以刺激國內工商業之發展、第二、因通貨制度之改善、外匯可以控制、年來我國貨幣、因銀價之影響、而價値過度增高者、至是可以恢復常態、如是、則外國貨幣價昂、外國貨物輸入成本大增、而外貨價格、將隨之而上漲、其結果足以鼓勵輸出、减少輸入、而國際收支、可以調整、有此上列二因、則物價今後之即或上漲、非通貨膨脹之結果、而爲經濟繁榮之結果、如是、則我政府最近公佈之新貨幣法案、於物價固有利也、世之皇皇然驚於通貨膨脹之誤會者、可以冰然釋矣、第二、外匯是否因之而發生劇變、曰、我之外匯、今後可以穩定、新法案足以改善外匯也、自客歲八月、世界銀價大漲以後、我外滙率規定之方法有二、第一、隨世界銀價之變動而變動、即所謂盤旋於平價左右、如是則年來我國外匯、應當盤旋於二十便士至二十四便士左右、而不應盤旋於一先令五辨士上下也、第二，脫離世界銀價、而自定匯價、我國最近一年來外匯率之厘定、即是法也、因之我國外滙、在事實上、一年來已成爲廢棄銀本位國家之外匯、其變動之主因、由於市塲匯票之需要與供給、或因於政府之控制、然我國外匯、在此一年脫離銀價關係之下、其形勢非常穩定也、凡熟悉我國外滙最近一年來之决定方法者、其原則、與其謂基於世界銀價、無寗謂其基於世界金價、且上海市塲、外商銀行對於外匯率之勢力、羣知其不可忽視、刻不聞外商銀行之有力者、歌頌我國幣制政策、在此形勢之下、諒不至與我爲難、又况我對外匯、政府明令中·中·交三行、盡力供給、而已有準備之應付歟、故我國今後外匯、尙穩定於適合我國經濟之一點、以過去三四年我國外滙變動之經過、與最近放棄金本位國家之外匯衡之、最近我國外滙、或可即由此而合理穩定者也、最近政府新貨幣法案、在外匯變動原理方面、固無大影響於外匯率之波動、且在此法案公佈前後、我國外滙、在事實上已爲脫離銀價、而自固其藩籬、今後之形勢、仍自若也、</p>

<h3>中興路午夜盜刦　警士奮勇捕盜被殺</h3>
<p>警士持槍入門盜匪對准其胸擊殺　閘北商店痛惜死者集議補助喪費</p>
<p>閘北盜匪横行、近來屢出刧案、前夜十一時五十分、中興路（共和新路西）兆豐里對過一二二九號小弄內第二十二·二十三·號瓦平房、（係坐東朝西、前面是一大空地、即數年前捉逃兵焚毀草棚之處）、有臯寗人張國康、年四十五歲、在該處放黄包車爲生、不料</p>
<p>爲匪垂涏</p>
<p>乘車夫入內交班時、突有身穿藍布衫褲及黑布褂褲之匪四人、口操北方音及江北聲音、出示手槍三枝、嚇　聲張、先將張妻曹氏與媳姜氏耳上金環各一副脫下、幷將各人身上所藏鈔洋共六十九元六角刦取、當搶劫時、張有女名小妹、十七歲、聞聲後節從擱上之</p>
<p>窗洞躍出</p>
<p>擬奔至中興路派出所報吿、緣兩足受傷、行至半途、巳走不動、坐在地上、其時適有一不識姓名之買菜老者經過、小妹即吿以我家有强盜、該買菜人即代向派出所報吿、此時門崗唐尙錦、係上九至十二之差、</p>
<p>正要下差</p>
<p>時、所以上落兩班警長郝立開·莊敬藻·皆在準備、一聞報告盜刧、一警長立即率同門崗唐尙錦赶往、唐抵事主門首、見大門半開、該警乃拔出手槍奮勇上前、詎此時匪等已搶畢、四人均聚在大門內、爲欲爭戴銅盆帽、故尙未出門、匪見唐警入門、隨即對凖該警</p>
<p>胸口一槍</p>
<p>唐警中槍後、知已受傷、立即退出、行約二十步左右、遂倒臥在弄中、後匪見外面無人、相繼逃出、而二警長則伏於路旁、且見唐警受傷倒地、亦奮不顧身、上前追趕、匪等乃亂發手槍、且戰且逃、無如</p>
<p>時在黑夜</p>
<p>該處又皆係荒地、致被鬼脫、迨中興路派出所巡官謝中一聞得槍聲、率領大隊警士趕至、匪已不知去向、遂一面搖電話至救火會、派救護車到來、而唐警</p>
<p>早已氣絕</p>
<p>幷一面報吿新閘分局、寥分局長立飭偵緝分隊值正班長劉長佩、率領偵緝員朱金榮·感鼐·前往、在出事地點、檢獲匣子砲彈壳二粒、係在荒地上拾得、又事主家匪徒遺落銅盆帽兩頂、手電洞二個各帶案、事後該警所於昨日上午、着金二圖地保王少廷投上海</p>

<p>作事勇敢</p>
<p>家有妻女各一、妻唐氏、年二十四歲、嘉定人、女年僅十四、係前妻所生、此事發生後、當地各商店等、以該警爲公捐軀、昨特邀請各店主如胡一波·丁懷德堂藥店丁壽彭·三茂米店李標元·順新糟坊余良　，仁大水行戴恩溥·同心洽水電行任師濤·三豐米店談明賢·等討論、結果除請新閘分局設法從優撫恤外、死者家族伊等亦將補治喪費用、</p>

<h3>交部謀防止流弊　整飭廣播電台</h3>
<p>近年以來、我國各地廣播電台、時有增設、民衆裝用收音機者、爲數尤衆、交通部以廣播事業、關於一國之政治文化、至爲鉅大、爲謀收正當功效、而免意外流弊起見、對於廣播電台之監督、極爲嚴格、茲將各情誌後、</p>
<p>停發給許可證</p>
<p>交通部規定用於廣播電台之週率、係自五百五十千週、至一千五百千週、各台應相差之數、並規定爲十千週、故事實上許可設立電台九十餘處、茲該部以此項週率、業將分配罄盡、而已成立各電台、又亟待整理、一律停止發給許可證、</p>
<p>取締不善電台</p>
<p>交通部劉於各廣播電台、於准許設立後、仍隨時嚴密稽査、其辦理不善者、分別取締、如情節重大即予懲處、最近實行取締之電台、已有十數處、其原因有係於准於設立後、迄未依限成立者、有係機件不良、迭經令飭改善未能遵辦者、有係播送淫詞邪曲、復不遵令受罰者、有係私自轉讓頂替者、</p>
<p>稽核播音節目</p>
<p>關於各電台播音節目、交通部巳迭將應播送曁禁止播送事項、隨時指示、茲爲稽核便利起見、特通飭各台、將播音節目檢呈一份、嗣後如有變更、並應於五日前呈報、再該部計劃、俟各台播昔節目收集齊全後、加以縝密之審核、對於一般廣播電台應有之節目、及其時間之分配、擬作一適當之規定云、</p>
<h3>郵局钜刦案辯理論終結</h3>
<p>悟空和尙供詞狡賴完全否認　吉文彬向捕房報告自投羅綱　法院定下星期三宣判</p>
<p>北四川路郵政總局、被劇盜持械刦去鉅欵、並開槍傷斃人命、後經狄思戚路捕房派探馳赴江北阜寗等處、陸續緝獲盜僧悟空和尙（即吉仁堂）等男婦、起出少數贓欵、迭次解由第一特區地方法院、審訊各情、屢誌報章、昨日下午、又爲該案續審之期、由承辦探員將在押之吉仁堂·邱國斌·周堯石·劉道生·吉文斌·李學士·李儀生·吳泮桂·王陳氏·吉陳氏·男婦十名口、解至第三法庭候審室、尙有陳邱氏一口、業經諭令交保出外、茲則</p>
<p>臨訉不到</p>
<p>二時半，美樹滋推事升座、命提李儀生·吳泮桂·兩名到案、宣吿彼輩被訴部份之判决、按李原充某輪茶役、因王陳氏於案發後、潛以所分贓欵一千元、縫入枕內、包就誧蓋、携乘該輪逃回江北、中途王陳氏被拘、而其鋪蓋當時由李儀生保管、嗣經捕房檢査、詎包藏枕內之千金、巳不翼而飛、故捕房訴李犯業務侵占罪、姜推事乃判以處徒刑三月、並科罰金三百元、如無力繳納、准以三元易科勞役一日、吳泮桂係市公安局派往郵局之請願警、因有</p>
<p>參加刦盜</p>
<p>事前密謀之嫌疑、而被以敎唆搶刦起訴者、茲與陳邱氏同被判决無罪、惟陳邱氏業經具保、且宣判時未曾投案、庭上祇諭吳在上訴期內亦具五百元保證齊、否則仍暫覊押、判畢、李吳即由探捕解返、而將其餘各被吿、除李學士猶留候審室外、概提至法庭、經姜推事逐一反覆硏詰、邱國斌承認由吉仁堂（即悟空和尙）分給贓洋二百五十元、該欵業已用罄、並承認將黑長衫借給</p>
<p>悟空和尙</p>
<p>不諱、對於事前爲盜匪墊付用費、則堅决否認、又稱在王陳氏·吉陳氏·兩家、見過悟空等、會議兩次、王陳氏供、盜共在家議過四次、第一次會議爲六月間、搶得鉅欵後、當夜悟空與我往閘北、分得七千元、以半數分給劉小四子、邱國斌得二百五十元、吉陳氏得二百元、故悟空實得三千元、以一千元給我、存入金城銀行、彼於翌日逃回江北、帶去一千元、尙餘一千元、則命我帶去、一我遂蔽於枕中、及被捕後、而枕內之欵、査已烏有、吉陳氏供認分得二百元不諱、迨質之悟空和尙、仍</p>
<p>一味狡賴</p>
<p>、不但在捕房歷次之自白、完全否認、即在阜寗被捕時、經阜寗縣府鞠訊之供詞、亦不自承、周堯石亦祇供認在王陳氏家與悟空同榻吸鴉片、否認參預槍刦會議、及事後分得贓洋一百五十元之種種事實、劉道生則稱、係被告吉文斌挾嫌誣陷、而吉文斌供、渠因失業、由梁姓收容在家充庖丁、梁等每次會議、劉皆在座、手槍係陳姓從江北帶來、彼輩於九月八日下午、由梁家出發、搶俊</p>
<p>均未復返</p>
<p>嗣途遇陳姓、始知劉分有贓欵、巳交其姨帶歸江北、故即以此事向滙司捕房二九七七號華捕報吿等語、姜推事以案情已經審究明瞭、論令開始辯論、各被吿之未委任律師者隨爲指定律師辯護、先由捕房律師張師竹發言、就各被吿之犯罪行爲、加以分別、以悟空雖極狡展、然參以共犯之供詞及種種證據、實屬無可抵賴、至吉文斌旣能詳悉盜匪密議之計劃、自係盜黨、嗣其出首吿發、當爲未得分贓或嫌所分稀少、自首乃洩忿之間、兼冀獲得捕房獎賞、蓋其初未料、</p>
<p>自投羅綱</p>
<p>應請按律懲治、繼由被吿律師次第辯護之下、庭諭候下星期三下午宣判、最後命提李學士至案、訊據供稱、因劉小四子之母、在阜寗波廳拘押、我被田主遣來上海找尋其女朱小毛、由朱給我二百餘元、着帶回籍、俾充其母訟事費用云云、姜推事以關於李學士部份、尙須調查、論改期本月十九日下午再訊、李因無保、仍被連同悟空等解回捕房、分別羈押、</p>

<h3>上海工商業槪況（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>三　異動數字之分業觀察</p>
<p>欲研究各業間之消長，必須注意各業間之異動數字，今將二十三年份及本年上期各業新創數字，列表如左：（單位一家）</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉</p>
<p>廿三年　廿四年上期　廿三年　廿四年上期　廿三年　廿四年上期</p>
<p>銀行　六　三　一　六　九</p>
<p>特種事業　錢莊　三　二六　二　八　八</p>
<p>銀號滙兌莊等　二　六　一四　一　四</p>
<p>經紀人　一一　七　四　一七　四　一〇</p>
<p>新創　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>廿三年　廿四年上期　廿三年　廿四年上期　廿三年　廿四年上期</p>
<p>紗廠　二</p>
<p>其他紡織業　二　五九　三一　九　一一</p>
<p>金屬工業　三　二八　二〇　七　七</p>
<p>化學工業　二　一九　八　八　二</p>
<p>製造業　槍膠工業　一五　一　五　五</p>
<p>日用品工業　一五　三　七一　四〇　二四　七</p>
<p>捲烟　五　一　三　二</p>
<p>麵粉　二　一　一　一</p>
<p>其他飲食品業　八　一　九〇　一七　一三</p>
<p>呢絨綢布　七　三　三〇　二八　一八　一〇</p>
<p>五金號　七　三　二六　二一　三〇　一二</p>
<p>販賣商　百貨業　九　四　一七〇　九六　八〇　四四</p>
<p>飲食品　三　二　三七八　二三九　七六　四五</p>
<p>烟兌　二　四　八〇　一</p>
<p>其他　六九　二〇　三五四　三一五　七二　七三</p>
<p>合計　一四七　四八　三九〇　九三一　三六六　二五〇</p>
<p>觀上表，吾人可知近年來除一般工商業外，金融業亦同陷於不景氣之洪爐，其他主要工業，如紗廠，橡膠，捲烟，麵粉諸業，均了無生氣，至减工或一部份停工之工廠，尙未與焉。</p>
<p>四　異動原因之分析</p>
<p>硏究各業間之異動原因，亦頗有興趣，通常除新創外，改組與閉歇，必有極明顯之理由，或係政治的，如戰事及政府收回國營等，或係一般經濟的，如市面衰落，營業淸淡，外貨傾銷等，或係內部病態，如意見不洽，作僞舞弊等，茲將二十三年份及本年上期上海各工商業之改組原因，分析如次：</p>
<p>廿三年家數　百分比　廿四年上期家數　百分比</p>

<h3>小男兒（八七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>衣服破爛，骯髒，消瘦，疲乏，—是他的開竅　一腳裸着，另一腳是用老在舊姜黃色的短衫縛着，分明是從他自己的背上取下來聊以包裏一些創傷的。他似乎想藏身一個乾草堆的後面，可是睡夢中不知不覺伸出了一個臂膀便使人發現了他。他嘆息着，咕嚕着，彷佛是在做惡夢，有一次他動了，就呻吟着恍似作痛，可是實在困　極了，所以不久又儘自睡去了。</p>
<p>「他不宜睡在這裏的，」裴夫人說道，於是俯伏在他的身上，輕輕的呌他的名字。他張開了眼睛望着她，彷佛她也是夢境的一部，因為他微笑朦朧地說道：「裴媽媽，我歸來了。」</p>
<p>他的一種神色和寥寥幾個字使她十分感動，她伸手在他頭上，幫他起來，並且以她那種懇摯的態度說道：</p>
<p>「我原想你會歸來的，我很喜歡看見你，唐恩。」其時他似乎已豁然醒了，忽然廻顧他的左右，彷佛他猛憶了他所在的地方，便是對於那種懇切的歡迎也覺懷疑。他的臉面驟然變了，以他舊有粗暴的神氣說道：</p>
<p>「我原定明天早上就走的。我只半路停下來一看罷了。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不進來呢，唐恩？你不聽見我呌你嗎？坦第看見了，大聲嚷着要見你。」</p>
<p>「我想你會許我進來的，」他說道，一面已經拿起了一個小包裏翻來覆去，彷彿立刻要走模樣。</p>
<p>「你目試試看，裴夫人簡單作答道，伸出她的手指點着屋子的門，就這裏可以望見熒熒的燈光，像是在歡迎遠客的樣子。</p>
<p>唐恩嘆了一口長氣，好似丢了心上的一塊重石，然後拿起一根粗杖開始一蹺一拐走向那所屋子，忽停下，似有所叩問道，</p>

<h3>新貨幣政策與國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>易經上說過；『窮則變，變則通。』天下的事，總不脫這一個原則。最近爲了貨幣問題，巳弄到山窮水盡的地步，主張不一，學說紛紜，尤其是國貨界受到很深切的痛苦。最近中央財政當局，用快刃新亂麻的手段頒布新貨幣政策，發表宣言，鄭重解釋，實應時勢的要求，爲改革財政上應有的行動，苟能運用滴當，辦理得人，於經濟金融不但沒有不良的影響，今後我國經濟上金融上之恐慌，轉可逐漸消滅，此種政策，很値得國人所一致贊同的。不過新貨幣政策頒布以後，於我國貨界之影響很大，在頒布之前夕，國貨界奔走相告，停止發貨，認爲今後物價之騰貴，爲必趨之塗徑，先事預防，亦屬廳有之舉動。果焉明令早頒，物價夕漲，蓋新貨幣政策之效力，因有刺激物價上漲之可能，物價上漲，大可流通國內貨物，使停滯之工商業，有舒暢發展之機會，苟非過度的漲上，並避免投機者之壟斷操縱，轉足促進國貨事業之活躍，有利於全國之經濟復興。宋子文氏謂『防止投機及過度抬高物價者之企圖，目前實爲政府從速實現此遠大的財政金融改革之良機，全國人民之福利舉將因此而增加。』這是極有價値的談話，記者就國貨的立塲，發表鄙見五項，希望國內賢者切實指敎</p>
<p>一，法幣以無限制買賣外匯，與國際貿易上關係最巨，深盼經營外匯事業中對於不需要的進口貨物，設法限制，免奪國貨的原有市塲。</p>
<p>二，政府與社會應從速注意市面之安定，安定外匯尤須安定物價，宵小造謠，奸商操縱，均應從數取締，以安市面。</p>
<p>三，法幣政策頒布以後，國際貿易必見活躍，尤其是出口貿易，有顯著的進步，希望國貨界改善製造，精究出品，以得外商的信任，尤其應當研究成本减低，出品迅速，萬勿僅僅於抬高物價上用工夫。</p>
<p>四，法幣政策，旣非通貨膨脹，亦非低幣政策，實係通貨管理政業。故國貨界應力持鎭靜，沈着應付，與金融業開誠布公，求出品的暢銷，以遏金錢之外流。尤應放遠眼光，專力對外貿易的發展，使外貨减少一分進口卽爲國貨增加一分銷路，以復興國內凋敝之工商事業。</p>
<p>五，國貨界年來最大之苦痛，爲籌碼枯竭，資金呆擱，農村不景氣，社會購買力極度不振，自法幣政策頒布以後，不僅資金可供應國貨界正當企業之需要，抑且修正不動產抵押法令，以謀地產之活潑，如果一心一德，力循正軌，則工商之繁榮，可以預卜，今後輸出入貿易，可以有平衡之希望。此尤爲國貨最有希望之一點。</p>
<h3>法幣政策與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>最近，咱們中國政府，有一件含有重大意義的工作，頒佈了一個極有意思極有價値的命令，那便是前天（十一月四日）各報上所刊載的財政部所頒佈的實行法幣政策的命令。記者把財政部的佈吿，細細的研究一下之後，覺得這不僅與咱們中國的國計民生，社會經濟，國家命脈，有着重大的關係，同時，對於國貨的前途，也有很好的影響呢。所以。我覺得這是一件很値的欣慰的事，我們站在國貨界的立塲而論，尤其覺得這是一件很値的欣慰的事。</p>
<p>據財政部的佈吿上說：「自從白銀價格劇烈變動以來，國內通貨緊縮的現象，至爲顯著，因之工商凋敝，百業不振，而又資金源源外流，國際收支，大蒙不利，國民經濟，日就萎敗，種種不良狀况，紛然並起，計自上年七月至十月中間，三個半月之間，白銀流出凡二萬萬元以上，設不採有效措施，則國內現銀存底？必有外流罄盡之虞！……云云，我們看了這張佈吿，可知政府的緊急頒佈實行法幣政策令，的確是適應環境的需求，含有內在的時代的重大意義。</p>
<p>有人問我說：「實行法幣政策，固然與國計民生，大有關係，爲什麽對於國貨前途，也有很好的影響呢？」這位朋友的問題，我認爲是很有意思的，我們要知道，實行了法幣政策以後，市面上所通行的，大都是中央，交通，中國，三銀行的紙幣，一遇銀元，卽隨時收進，不使外流，這樣一來，全國的現金，都變爲國家所有，國人與國人之間的交涉，完全以法幣爲中心，設如有人要私運白銀出口，事實上已不可能，卽能蒙蔽一時，但一經査出，就要全部沒收，卽以國人的購買外貨而論，在過去是毫無問題的，但是，實行法幣制度以後，外人是需要現金交易的，怎樣能接受你的紙幣呢？於是要購買外貨的人，自然也沒有辦法了，而國貨的出品，倒有了一個暢銷的機會，這不是一件很好的事嗎？提倡國貨，高喊了好幾年，什麽國貨年，婦女國貨年，都已試過，終不能得到良好的效果，而法幣政策實行以來，眼見得國貨事業，可以馬上得到一個活躍的生機，這是如何的値得我們高興呀！所以我覺得實行法幣政策，對於國貨的前途，是有密切的關係的。</p>
<h3>請學生們應最後努力完成工作</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>從前古人說：「勿謂今日不學，而有來日，歲月逝兮，時不我再」！這幾句話，勗勉後人至深！光陰祗向前奔從不暫駐的，像本年號稱學生國貨年，已忽忽消逝將盡！所餘仍僅數十天了，試問淹忽過去的大半年來，學生們提倡國貨的成績如何？說來恐怕也很慚愧吧！可是消逝去的光陰，已無法挽回了，最緊要的，還是抓住現在，請全國的學生，在這短短的數十天賚貴駒光中，作最後的努力，來做勸用國貨的救國工作。</p>
<p>有人駁我道：「你也太無謂，一年快完了，還說這類廢話！」我道：不然！講得滑稽些，以萬米賽跑來比例；你在跑到六七千米的辰光，還在後面到不要緊，最是迫近九千米至終點的一刹那，果能鼓勇急急追趕得上，錦標仍屬於你的！所以凡事總在結束時問爲準的，况且現在氣候由凉轉寒，民衆方面對於飲食服用諸品，不似夏日的簡單，必須多量的購備，以應所需，這時正是諸位學生工作緊張之秋，一方面勸勉民衆，應該一致服用國貨，一方面組織調査團，詳確檢査以偽亂眞的國貨，和指導民衆各種國貨的商標及形態，俾民衆得有深切的認識，不致誤購贗品，如此切實幹去，雖在短時期中，我决定必獲良好的効果，建樹最後的奇績，而完成學生國貨年的全部工作。</p>
<h3>婦女與提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 玉珂</p>
<p>一個很大的窮字，已　澈了我們整個的中國，可是爲什麽這樣窮呢？近年來的天災人禍，固然爲窮的一種原因，但最大的原因，還是因爲農工商業的不發達。在帝國主義經濟侵略的壓迫下，我國的農工商業，祇有遲早地走上死路的。我們要脫離這條死，自然只有取消不平等條的；不過還有一件重要的工作，就是要把農工商業建設起來，是故提倡國貨，實爲很重要的辦法。</p>
<p>農工商業是互相依賴的，工業不發達，農業不會發達，商業更不會發達，商業發達了，農業工業也會跟者發達，是帶有因果的連璦性的；我們要使工商業發達，先要使自己的工業物暢銷？商業成爲自己的商業，第一步要使中國的金錢不流到外國去；要使金錢不向外流，便要極力提倡國貨，排去外國貨，使自己的國貨畅銷，於是農工商業可以振與，國家的貧窮，可以打破！</p>
<p>這是一定的，尤以女子們最愛用洋貨；女子們喜歡漂亮，酷愛時髦，我們只要看，各公司商店裏的洋貨全是婦女用品居多，衣料和化裝品是最大宗，其餘關於婦女方面的東西，尤不勝數說。假定婦女能猛然反悟個個用國貨，洋貨就幾乎可以斷路絕跡。女同胞同爲國家民衆之一，有應享之權利，有應盡之義務；換言之：婦女同有負起提倡國貨，挽救國家之責任。否則，國家破亡，受壓迫，做人奴隸，决無男女之分呵！但婦女們怎樣提倡國貨呢？簡述之於下：</p>
<p>甲，提倡節儉，購用國貨：</p>
<p>（一）婦女所有衣飾及應用物品，須一律購用國貨；並廣勸家族親友，切實購用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）婦女服飾應以樸素爲尙，一切番裝異服，及過於華麗貴重物品，均宜屛除。</p>
<p>乙，提倡女子職業：</p>
<p>（一）提倡婦女實行操作，不得安逸好閒。</p>
<p>（二）獎勵婦女家庭工藝。</p>
<p>（三）組織婦女用品國貨消費合作社。</p>
<p>丙，敎育兒童養成購用國貨習慣：</p>
<p>（一）兒童玩具均應購用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）應爲兒童灌輸愛國及購用國貨之知識。</p>
<h3>轉變心理</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>年來「洋貨」中，很有許多東西，「國貨」中也有了。而且有的「國貨」，還勝過了「洋貨」，價錢也有的較「洋貨」爲廉。但是，國人依然是大多數喜歡服用「洋貨」，而不愛用「國貨！」有人問我說：這是哈個道理？我說：這是一種心理，在那裏作的怪啊！</p>
<p>因爲，大家的心理上，都覺得「洋貨」不好而好，那怕價貴，也要去買它。至於「國貨」，似乎總覺得是粗俗不堪，那怕價廉物美，視若敝屣！唉！大家存了這種心理，「國貨」那得抬頭？</p>
<p>所以，我要用「轉變心理」四個字，作爲本文的題目，意之所在，無非是要希望國人從今以後，快把這種愛用「洋貨」而不愛「國貨」的心理，轉變一下。說得明白點，便是希望大家快拿對待「洋貨」的心理來對待「國貨」。如果，眞能彀人人這樣，「洋貨」一定不打而倒，「國貨」便可以抬頭。謂予不信，大家不妨試試看。</p>
<h3>談店員的訓練問題</h3>
<p>— 葉奕頤</p>
<p>—店員的訓練，對於國貨的銷售，有着密切關係—</p>
<p>寫這篇文字的動機，我有下面幾段斷片的事實：</p>
<p>爲着學校開學未久，種種課業用品還沒有齊備完全，因此，趁者星期假日，就到外邊去購買一點東西。先跑到四馬路，到一家買標語圖表的書店，看到幾個店員在閒談，衣服是滿穿得漂亮洋灑，生意好像滿不在乎。我進去後，看了看圖表，問了問價錢；那知幾個店員的上身又伏在玻璃板上在閒談了。我一見情形如此，價格也很昂貴，就走了出來。沿着四馬路朝西，到了福建路，踏進了一家紙店，想買一些毛邊紙來叫我的孩子們自己訂簿子，作爲練習寫字之用；豈知那店員在我問他價格的時候，來了一個電話，因此就把我這個顧客，丢在旁邊，自己去了；我問別的店員，別的店員理都不理，頭歪了去，大槪這生意不是他接的，所以不關：苦我等了一刻多鐘，才買到了紙頭回去。經過蓬萊市塲，到一家店舖裏去買一隻長城牌的熱水壺，進去看了幾種式樣，在我問着價格的時候，來了幾位女性顧客，那店員見我問着價格，也許太麻煩討厭，就傲聲對我發問：「喂！你到底要不要買」？我聽着這一問，並不光火，悠然地說：「當然囉！要買的。大槪你先生有什麽事吧？那末，可以請別位店員來代替你好啦！」他默然，我就揀了一種一元半的，給了他錢，拿了張沒有印花的發票，就走了。</p>
<p>根據着上面幾樁事實，我個人覺得，店員的訓練，確是一個很値得萬分注意的問題。因爲這個問題，影響於國貨用品的銷售，其關係實在是至重且大，非常密切。要是店員的訓練不良，表面視之，固然爲老闆股東之損失；而實際上，要亦爲國貨工業品之直接損失也。反而言之，店員態度誠懇，言語和藹，服裝簡潔，禮貌有方，顧客自然滿意而購，去後下次再來；如此，營業之得有發達，方有可待。</p>
<p>所以，店員的訓練，對於國貨的銷售，有着非常深切之關係；因此，店員的訓練，確然爲國貨界同仁，宜有加以注意的問題。茲略就管見所及，寫幾點訓練的目標於后：</p>
<p>（一）態度要誠懇一個店員的態度，對於顧客，是大有關係的；態度誠懇者，可以使顧客戚動得不買東西，好像是萬分說不過去的事。反之，熊度傲慢者，則顧客看了看就去，因爲別處也可以買到的。</p>
<p>（二）言語要流利如果言語不流利，往往要冒犯顧客。譬如當一個顧客來的時候，做店員的就得竭力介紹，該種國貨用品，很客氣的說明其優點所在。</p>
<p>（三）禮貌要恭敬一個顧客的前來，是好的現象，你就應該用着很恭敬的禮貌對待他；你管你，任他去看，那就糟了。他前來時，你就得很恭敬的招待他，須知有禮貌，不是一件無恥的事啊！</p>
<p>（四）服裝要簡潔一個店員的服裝，初視之，似無關重要；實際上，亦宜簡潔爲是。因爲滿身舶來之貨，亦非模範店員也。</p>
<p>上述四點，是否有當，尙祈讀者先生，有以指正。</p>
<h3>國貨小玩具</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>國貨的小玩具，我前天已經介紹了惠山的泥塑；近日到蘇州去旅行，又給我發見了一件値得介紹的東西，便是木凟鎭產的木製玩具。</p>
<p>木瀆鎭離蘇州城有二十多里路，那邊有靈岩山天平山等好風景，所以去玩的人倒也不少。從前水路行船，來往要化費半天工夫，現在築有公路，公共汽車不消一點鐘便到，因此益發熱鬧了。我旣已到了蘇州，當然也去賞光一番，半山紅樹，兩岸野花，自有一種風景，因無關本文，無庸細述。在靈岩山和天平山兩處，我發見許多鄉人，帶了若干木製小玩具來兜售，使我心中陡然一動。這些木製玩具，在我小時，也曾和無錫大阿福風行各地：我做小孩時又很歡喜玩弄牠。想不到牠現在給舶來品玩具打倒，躱在山脚下，祇供遊山的人買去作紀念品，您想可嘆不可嘆！我再看看牠的種類和製法，也比我小時進步許多。種類有本蛋，木彈，燭台，茶碗，酒杯，飯碗，花瓶，筆筒，缸甏，　碗等等，而且式樣也小巧玲瓏，色澤也光滑文雅，倘使置在大公司的橱窗內，一定能善價而沽，可惜落在鄉人手內，最高的價格，也不到五分小洋一件，你想悽慘不悽慘呢！</p>
<p>我從一位老年的小販手裏，化了四角小洋，買了十多件，順便問問他的製法。他說：「這種木器原料，倒是堅硬的楡樹做的。因爲大塊的楡木，已經製成了家用的器具，鋸下的邊角，沒有用塲，我們便論斤的批下來，先在太陽中晒透，因爲潮濕的木頭，做成的東西，一乾便豁坼，那末前功盡棄，難以變錢了：木晒乾後，用墨綫畫了樣子，用刀鑿製成粗胚：再在車木上一車，便光滑細緻了！要色彩油潤，那末塗上一層熟油就可。我們做成這些東西，本錢雖不大，功夫却很費的」。我聽了他一番話，心想中國的手工業產品那一伴不是這般呢！要改良生產，首須注意到機械。</p>
<p>回到上海，把這些小木器送給戚友，沒一個不稱好，因此做這篇文字來宣傳和介紹。</p>
<h3>一品夫人</h3>
<p>— 愛吾</p>
<p>「一品夫人」這是帝王時代一種榮譽的封號，只有宰相大臣才能領受這種封號的。現在雖然巳經沒有帝王的封號，但是「夫人」這種稱呼却很流行。</p>
<p>由官爵判定品級，這是專治而不合理的；可是用人品來分高低，那却値得人們同意。譬如說稱顧先生的夫人爲「一品夫人」，她就當之</p>
<p>顧夫人有相當的學識，並且善於烹調縫袵，自從她嫁給顧先生後，眞是顧先生的一個好內助，她帮助着她的丈夫，處理着家庭的瑣務；無論是到她家裏去過的賓客，或者她的鄰居，都贊嘆着她的賢明，</p>
<p>顧夫人的容貌也很是秀美，據她自己說注重容貌美還要兼顧內心的美，因爲內心和容貌是有連帶的關係的。至於她所用的化妝品，也很簡單，僅有兩三種也都是國貨，她秋冬潤面的就是五洲藥房的「一品香雪花」，她常對人說，提倡國貨是我們的天職，何况這種出品質美而價廉呢。</p>
<p>像顧夫人這樣一個有學識，有技能，有德行，並且有愛國的精神的女性，我們稱她爲一品夫人，誰說不宜？</p>

<h3>人造汽油的發明</h3>
<p>— 象賢</p>
<p>在二十世紀的世界裏，汽油爲一種極重要的原動力，但是我國所使用的各種汽油，莫不仰賴舶來，根據二十二年海關報吿册，汽油進口總數爲二千一百三十二萬九千元，又二十三年汽油進口總額爲一千九百三十一萬二千元，今年公路發展，進行甚爲積極，有連帶關係的運輸汽車，當然要大批添購，那末汽油的消耗，當超出已往的額數，長此以往將何堪設想，國人自造汽油之發明，實爲刻不容緩的事，最近杭州民生製造廠研究部主任徐伯鋆先生，發明一種人造汽油，巳經航空學校試用，結果成續極佳，爲國人一大貢獻，關係民族前送極大，現在把他發明經過情形，筆之以告讀者，希望大家加以深刻的注意。</p>
<p>徐伯鋆先生爲浙江上虞人，現年二十九歲，曾在日本千葉醫科大學攻醫學，得學士位，民國二十一年返國，擔任民生廠硏究部主任，平日常在研究室中，孜孜從事化騐工作，亦曾先後發明殆炭靈，喜美靈等藥品，此次之發明人造汽油，確在偶然無意之中發見，係偶在鄉人手中發現一種特殊性狀的礦土，於是從事研究他的性質及效用，因此得知此種礦土，在化學上有特殊的良好效用，卽以觸煤分解之，結果產生極微的瓦斯，和產生多量的油焦油，色作淡黄，有螢光，比較用油類乾溜所得的黑褐色的油焦油更佳，於是用普通提煉汽油的方法把他堤煉，再檢査他的化學和物理上的各種性質和狀况，遂得證明這種所提煉出來的汽油，和天然汽油是同一性質，於是經中央航空學校周校長，和了浙江省建設廳曾廳長的嘉勉和贊助，在去年十二月十五日試騐於一百二十匹馬力的飛機發動機上，試騐成績，反而比較天然汽油良好，這種意外的收獲，不能不算一件極大的貢獻，何况國產汽油爲當前的急需，亟願政府當軸，和了社會大衆予以提倡援助，這樣纔可以替中國工業前途，放出一綫光明啊！</p>

<h3>出版界與軍隊</h3>
<p>— 謝炳文</p>
<p>出版界與軍隊，在我們中國，是隔着南北極那樣的遼遠。</p>
<p>出版家做生意，以爲圖書館學校，才是自己的大顧主；印了圖書是給敎授學生們，以及一般智識份子讀的。至於軍人，大家總以爲除了拿槍桿子之外，彷彿是再不需要書本子的。若夫一般士兵，那不僅爲出版家的忽視，其實自古以來，就被擯出於文化的圈外了。這層傳統的隔閡，造成了中國軍隊的落後，使一般士兵變得非常愚昧和粗魯。很明顯的，這原因當然是由於軍隊文化敎育的不振。但是不振的原因，並非是因爲兵營裏面的人不喜歡讀書，厭惡文化敎靑的緣故；而其實是歷來中國士大夫抱着偏見，以爲武人只是學藝，用不着通文理的。故此文武雙全的人，在先前是非常希罕的，而軍隊中文盲的普遍化，至今也還是最平凡的現象。</p>
<p>但是，世界是進化了。月前是二十世紀。文武的界限已被科學技術的狂飈所摧毀。軍人使用現代的武器，不但要武裝手和身子，而且要充分的武裝自己的頭腦了。</p>
<p>例如歐美日本之所以强盛與文明，據出版界與軍隊間的密切情形來看，也是顯而易見的。日本每年所出版的士兵讀物，據說佔全國出版物總量的百分之二十以上。爲着士兵而編的軍事政治經濟的小册子，雖是無從統計，但單就供給軍隊閱讀的流行雜誌，就有了四十多種哩。在英法諸國，文學家描寫戰爭與軍隊生活的作品是很多的，而他們主要的讀者對象，也就在兵營之中。雷馬克，盧梭，巴比塞之熱烈的擁戴者，有許多便是軍人。因爲他們的作品，刻畫着軍人的內心，軍人的靈魂。而現在，在德，意諸國，文人也有奉命寫着作品獻給軍人的，那是帶着鼓勵的作用——歌頌戰爭或宣傳軍國主義的。若夫蘇俄那樣的國家，出版界更是有計劃地大規模的印刷着士兵的讀物。他們所出版的「紅軍文庫，」委實是頗可注意的？</p>
<p>返觀我們中國，情形就完全兩樣了。出版界對於軍隊的文化敎育，差不多沒有什麼恊助。因之，適用的軍士讀物，簡直是鳳毛麟角。固然一二個當過少爺兵小姐兵的作家，也寫過一些從軍日記，但那些究竟不是軍士們所能理解的。必須知道，現在中國一般士兵所讀的東西，還祇有一種『士兵日課』。自然，這是不能滿足士兵的智識慾的。但實際上有許多士兵，在崗位上偷看着小說唱本的事，我是常時親眼看到過的。于此司見：中國士兵大多數雖是文盲，但愛好智識的慾望則是人人都燃燒着。如果中國出版界能够倣效日本需店的辦法，有系統的編輯幾種有趣味的士兵讀物，包含各種軍事，政治，經濟，地理和自然科學的基本軍用課本；我想：那銷路一定是不壞的。</p>
<p>而且，因爲中國軍隊在近年來的確經過了一番整理，紀律與建制上比較的有了不少進步；在將來編制國防軍時，自然更少不了要以文化敎育同時並施的。現在當局正積極的在進行着軍隊中的啟蒙敎育，所以客觀上需要出版界很大的協助。這種協助，無疑的，是中國出版界非常光榮的神聖的任務。何况目前出版界，正陷於不景氣的氛圍中，受着經濟恐慌的襲擊；假如出版界眞正能把翻印大批古書的一部份財力與人力，去協助軍隊中的文化敎育事業，那末，這不僅是對國家盡了忠實的服務，而且也爲出版界自身開闢了一個新的領域。</p>

<h3>略談文學的翻譯</h3>
<p>— 得中</p>
<p>自所謂「歐風東漸」以來，將中國的封條啟開。歐美的槍砲，不但打開了中國的關口要塞，而且打開了中國人的眼睛。大家睜開眼睛看看，外國並不像自己想像的那樣蠻夷鄙陋，而且還有些什麽東西，我們是應該學習的。</p>
<p>憑眼睛能够看到的，只有「聲光化電」和「船堅砲利」了。外國只有這些物質方面的東西，我們應該去學。於是出了「中學爲體，西學爲用」的口號。</p>
<p>同時在文學方面，也發生了應和的表現，便是林紓的譯品。他在哈葛德「斐洲烟水愁城錄」譯本的自序說：</p>
<p>「處處無不以洛巴革爲針綫，何乃甚類我史遷也。……觀其着眼，必描寫洛巴革爲全篇之樞紐，此即史遷大宛傳篇法也。』</p>
<p>又在迭更司孝女耐兒傳譯本自序說：</p>
<p>「余嘗謂古文中敍事，惟叙家常平淡之事爲最難着筆，史記外戚傳述寳長君之目陳，謂「姊與我別逆旅中，丐沐沐我，飯我，乃去。」其足生人惋愴者，亦祗此數語。……究竟史公於此等筆墨，亦不多見。以史公之書，亦不專爲家常之事發也。今迭更司則專意爲家常之言，而又專寫下等社會家常之事，用墨着意爲尤難。』</p>
<p>這很顯然以「中學爲體，西學爲用」爲標榜。所以翻譯的原故，還是因爲原作有「類我史遷」，或「史遷於此等筆墨，亦不多見」的地方　當時此種影響廣及於各雜誌報紙上，所有譯品，差不多都以這種思想爲準則。</p>
<p>「中學爲體，西學爲用」的觀念，到五四時代才消滅。在文學的翻譯上，也同時因之起了一個長足的改進。第一，翻譯注重於原作的風格，不再牽强於中國的什麽什麼。第二，爲要保持原作的風格，用語體文，絕對忠實的翻譯。</p>
<p>此後，人們對於翻譯，確實能按照這新的改進而努力下去，但除了少數的雜誌和譯者，能注重於某一個方面以外，大多數還是無系統無目的的翻譯。鄭振鐸說：</p>
<p>『我們介紹歐美文學，已有三四十年的歷史，却從來不曾有過有計劃的介紹；往往都是隨手抓到一本便譯，或爲流行觀念所拘束，往往費了很大的力量，去譯些二三流的著作。（世界文庫編例）」</p>
<p>這話是對三四十年來翻譯上的針砭，可以代表中國翻譯界全體的一種新認識。</p>
<p>與這種認識，前後相伴而生的，從去年後半年到今年前半年，有三種重要的刊物。</p>
<p>第一種是「譯文」。</p>
<p>在「譯文」的「前記」里，沒有標榜什麼大目標，大計劃，只是說：</p>
<p>『不是想豎起「重振譯事」的大旗來，——這種登高一呼的野心是沒有的，不過得這麽幾個同好互相硏究，印出來給喜歡看譯品的人們作爲參考而已」。</p>
<p>但我們試一翻看這刊物的內容，便可以看到許多近代的而至於現代的，現實主義或反現社會的作家的作品，和弱小民挨的作品。</p>
<p>他們雖然沒有什麽大吹大擂，但從刋物的內一客吿訴我們，並不是隨隨便便的『幾個同好互一相究硏。」</p>
<p>第二是「世界文學」。</p>
<p>在「世界文學」的「發刋詞」上說：</p>
<p>「在現代中國文學里，形式的，文字的一般化是一個大問題。此外，把內容納入世界文學的領土去確立中國文學的面向，深化情思，澤潤外貌，這也是一個大問題。尤其從內容上講，中國文學也正如中國其它若干問題，都須捲入世界澎湃的巨浪，才有相當解决」。又說：</p>
<p>『本刋誕生，要勉盡新文學建樹途中的千百高分之一的責任。介紹各國文學，估量它對於世界文學抑即新文學的價値；登載形式或內容可以取資的作品；用絕對客觀態度，探尋中國文學的徑途。無時不是希望着這種旨趣在中國能够形成新的文學觀。引起國人對於新文學的注意。』</p>
<p>我們從這刊物的內容看來，大部也是注意在近代和現代作家的作品，但戰綫不及「譯文」那樣整齊，尤其是「詩歌」那部分。</p>
<p>以前兩刊物，都是全部介紹外國文學的，還有一種是一半刋登中國古籍，一半介紹國外的作品。即第三：「世界文庫」。</p>
<p>在「世界文庫」的「發刊緣起」上說：</p>
<p>「世界文學名著的介紹和誦讀，乃是我們這時代的人的最大任務（或權利）和愉快。』又說：</p>
<p>「我們的工作，便是有計劃的介紹和整理，將以最便利的方法，呈獻世界文學名著於一般讀者之前』。</p>
<p>從『世界文庫』已出的幾冊中看來，除了果戈理的死魂靈，西萬提斯的吉訶德先生傳，和高爾基，巴爾札克幾篇譯品，在現代讀者有着需要外，有些譯品頗類乎補白的的樣子，只可做文學史的參考，並且還有些算不得第一流作品的。固然，『世界文庫」的發刋，便是抱着介紹國外古今名著，和刊載中國古籍，以爲文學史的參考的目的，對於一般讀者的是否需要，好像是完全忽略了。但讀者爲了讀幾篇文章，而購買好多本包括着大部無需要的東西的書，未免太不便當。</p>
<p>綜觀以上，近一年來，文學的繙譯，確有了重振的趨勢。而對文學的繙譯的目的，也與從前大不相同，歸納之，可約爲三方；一，在現在這時候，中國的新文學，尙且少見很充實的作品出現，而讀者對國外的文學也很少接觸的機會，爲供給讀者的這些需要，繙譯國外文學作品，乃當前之急務。二，國外文學作品的風格的介紹，以供中國作者的參考和學習。三，文學是有世界性的，爲了使之成爲世界文學之一部，必有對國外文學的認識。</p>
<p>雖然現在對文學的繙譯，有了這樣進步的認識，和積極的努力，但不能對之過於樂觀，許多對繙譯的攻擊，沒有一日停止過，而讀者對譯品能够發生與趣和需要的，仍奮不很普遍。</p>
<p>現在『譯文』已經停刊了。而『世界文學』，據時事新報的『靑光』上說，也有將停刊的傳說。現在只有一個價貴而質並不甚充實的，且已經拖了一期的「世界文庫」還存在着。</p>
<h3>介紹三本趣味的數學書</h3>
<p>— 器重</p>
<p>歐洲中世紀流傳下來一首討厭算學的打油詩，大意說：「乘法令人煩悶，除法也很討厭，比例使人走投無路，演算要使人發癲』。的確，數學這一門功課，大多數的人不但感不到興趣，而且見了還要感到頭痛，所以一般學生的成績，終是數學最低劣。就是我個人，十幾年前在學校中，遇到考試數學，老是吃湯糰，數學教師每爲他本人的面子而特送二十分，我也就却之不恭而受之無愧。像我這樣的人，事實上多得很，就是有差別，相差也　得很，所以一般學生的成績，比較最不行的是數學。</p>
<p>爲什麽一般學生都不喜歡數學？不用說，這完全是趣味問題。無論求什麽學問第一是要有趣味。沒有趣味，决不會有什麽成績的。即以旅行而諭，如果對於旅行是有興趣的，則其登山涉水，雖然滿頭流汗而口中不停的喘氣，還是感釗十分快樂，不久就能達到「獨立山頭我爲峯』之目的的。反是，對於旅行沒有趣味的人，强其登山涉水，他只有感到痛苦而已。所以，求取學問，第一要緊的是興味。因爲數學是枯燥無味的學問，因些般學生的成績，也就最不行了。</p>
<p>很多的人，以爲學習數學，只求日常的應用，而現在學校中所學的算學，完全超出日常的應用了。因其不合日常的應用，所以對於枯燥的抽象的數學，見之益感頭痛，成績益見低劣。歐幾里得的學生，有一天問着歐幾里得『學了這樣難的桌西，到底有何好處？」這問題可以說是現在學生對於數學這門功課所大抵具有的，尤其是一班中學生。然則求取學問，不是就供目前之用，歐幾里得對於他學生的問題，就在袋中摸出三個銅元回答『你想得此三個銅元比獲得知識史甚吧』！我們要知道數學是硏究科學的基礎，我們决不能貪了眼前的三個銅元而就荒棄了科學的基礎，所以我們决不能以學校中所學的數學不合日常的應用而對之不熱心學習。</p>
<p>多數人知道硏究科學的重要，多數人也知道數學是研究科學的基礎，然而明知道這門功課的重要，而偏是對此重要的功課大家都要感到頭痛，所以敎授數學的先生，必須從新的方面去找尋材料，使枯燥無味的東西，學做新鮮有趣的材料，這等於苦味的藥物，誰都不喜服用，必須醫生想法滲入香甜之味，使人不覺雖服一樣。然而所謂敎科書，大都是枯燥無味的東西，所以我在這裏介紹的，並不是敎科書，乃是一般讀物的數　書。就是開明書店所出劉薰宇先生所著的「數學的園地」（四角半）『數學趣味』（八角）中學生雜誌　刊「數學與天才」（六角）三書。</p>
<p>這三本書，完全是用着富有趣味的筆調，講述數學的道理，使讀者閱讀的時候，像是看着富有趣味的小說，像是走進了美麗的花園之中，令人留戀忘返。「數學的園地」，是比較有系統的算理的說明：「數學趣味」是日常生活中隨處拾來的數學文章：『數學與天才』是集取幾個數學專家用趣味文字寫成的數學文章，內容與『數畢趣味』相似。我們且看看這幾個題目，究竟是不是有趣，『堆羅漢』『八仙過海』『韓信點兵』「王老頭子的湯摑』『假如我有十二僩指頭一……這不過是題目中的一部分，三本書中共有三十九篇文章，這三十九篇富有趣味的文章，通體讀了一遍，對於數學感得討厭的人，一定會對於數學發生很大的興趣。豐子愷先生說：『我一直沒有嘗過數學的興味，一道　有遊覽過數學的世界，到底是損失』。我覺得先生這幾句話，竟把我心中的話明顯地說出來了，我想和我同感者一定很有其人吧！</p>
<p>我不想爲開明書店做廣吿，使讀者貿然去購買此三書，我很希望讀者，不妨先到圖書館去借這三本書——或是借不到三本而僅借一本——來讀一本，如果讀了確實有興味的，那你再去買還不遲；因爲書店方面，决不會爲着目前的生活一天高貴一天而就把書的定價增加的。</p>
<p>對於數學感不到興趣的同志（因爲我是數學不行的人，與我一樣的，我不妨稱之爲同志），請注意我的話，能够由這三本書而引起了你們的數學的典味，這不僅是著作人的功績，也是同志們的　運啊！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>電話加價與減租</h3>
<p>— 忻忻</p>
<p>上海市塲的百業蕭條，自從滬戰之後，是更形深刻化起來，（這經過和原因，說起來不是這千字左右的短文中所能盡的，姑從略。）一直到現在，「經濟恐慌」這四個字不僅成了家喻戶曉的字眼，並且是成了『大拍賣」「大廉價」的市招了。恐慌程度的深入，已似第三期的肺病患者，無可遮掩的暴露了出來</p>
<p>隨了這非常露骨的形態而來的，必然的是减低房租的呼聲的高漲，因爲，在普通每月祗　千元左右營業的店舖，他的房租差不多便得一百元，以三分利計算，一家店舖每月的利益，祗有三百元左右，而除了房租之外，夥計的薪金，以友日常其他的開支，所得純利幾何？已是成爲一個問題：何况，在滬戰以後，一般店舖的營業至少得打個對折，那麽在打了對折以後的營業項下，是否出得起如許高昻的房租？已經是不言而喩的了。减低房租的呼聲原是非常合理的，而要復興上海，回復到先前的繁榮，那史是非實行减低房租不可。</p>
<p>然而，在减租的呼聲，響了二年之後的現在，除了一小部份的店舖住戶享受了八折，九折的優待之外，火部份的，還是「外甥撑燈籠」——照舊。</p>
<p>而在這减租問題尙未解决的時候，電話却又要按照新定價，按次收値的加價起來了。</p>
<p>昻貴的房租之外，在此百業簫條的當兒，市民們是否還再能擔負起更貴的電話費來呢？這用不到筆者來曉舌，適當其衝的市民們，是更明白的。</p>
<p>然而，房租沒减成，電話費要增加，却是鐵也似的事實。並且，這鐵也似的事實，在最近期間，又將實行了。</p>
<p>雖然，减低房租正在向六中全會請願中，電話的漲價也正繼續不斷的在反對，緣南京路市民聯合會的表示，在必要的時候，寗願電話局的剪綫，然而，以一個團體的力爭，因爲勢孤力單，不會得好結果原是必然的，而電話公司當局，却是一意孤行，堅持到底。</p>
<p>那麼，難道就在負得喘不過氣的負擔上再加上載重嗎？</p>
<p>當然是不的爲了復興上海，更爲了爭生存，减低房租和反對電話費漲價，那不僅氣憤塡膺的起來反抗一陣，狂呼一陣，我們還得堅决地採取一致行動，來貫澈我們的主張的。</p>
<p>我們知道，各自爲謀的以各個單位來要求，不是有條伴的被剝削之外，便是各個繫破。結果，除了被施行局部麻醉，短時間减輕痛苦之外，便毫無所得，興所謂復興上海，那自然更相差十萬八千里。</p>
<h3>五十塊錢</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>昏黄的太陽爬過「五子登科」的屋脊，照着這五間正屋的西窗了。正屋南向是一個寬闊的天井，左右的角里植着兩株玉蘭和丹桂，像兩個守門神似的把正屋藏在牠們底陰蔭下。正屋臨而是一垜高墻，高過正屋的樓房，墻外的過路人無從瞧見那個「五子登科」的屋脊；祗有一陣陣的丹桂幽香從墻里飄出來，使他們貪婪地向高墻瞥這末一眼。</p>
<p>是下午四點過後了，三五只烏鴉在玉蘭樹頂上盤旋，但是正屋里還沒有聲息，彷彿一座空樓似的罩在死寂的沉靜中。屋主人是本邑的鄉紳，大田地，這時候剛被他的姨太太從好夢中喊醒。他—有一個總稱叫胡太爺，雖然僅是四十歲的中年人，在華絲葛的被窩中翻了個身，伸出焦黄的手指揉着被眼尿迷糊了的眼睛，見姨太太在床前扳起面孔，（因爲她已經喚過他十幾次了，胡太爺始終把頭蒙在被窩里，這脾氣胡太爺自己也明白，他沒有睡醒什麽大事都不能喚他起身。）忙拉開嘴裝了個難看的笑容，想乘勢把姨太太樓過來。姨太太却彷佛一尊石柱一樣，不像平時弱不禁風地</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>一滑脚把上半身投到胡太爺的懷里，咯咯地笑起來：現在她　緊了臉，把胡太爺伸上來的手打了回去，眞怒地：</p>
<p>「睡不清的　　　了　　　，高　根上死了，看你……」</p>
<p>就背轉身，跌在床前的沙發椅里。胡太爺頓然把一對高關的眉毛鎖了起來，　但是　　　　是姨太太的醋勁。他把高阿根的女人弄來那天，就吵了個通宵，一尊二尺來高的玉佛被姨太太摔個粉碎，還是自己千求萬說，安靜下來的。高阿根的女人也眞有她的勁：把頭髪撤散了，衣服撕破了，尋死覓活，劉媽那張把死的說出活來的嘴還是不中用！姨太太却反而高興起來，她對胡太爺說：「那女人有什麽好看呢，這兩天更弄得不像個人，還是放她回去吧。聽說阿根早稻收得很好，把他的穀搬來就是了！」胡太爺笑着，他知道那女人兩天沒有飯吃之後，有些回心轉　，祗要瞞過姨太太的眼睛，玩過了就放她回家；而九十塊錢還是不怕阿根賴了的。昨天晚上，胡太爺偸偸地到密寳里去過，那女人安靜地坐在坑上吃飯，劉媽凑着他的耳朶說：這兩天內就有路道了，胡太爺你不要來，弄僵了我劉媽担不起這干係！謂媚地笑着把胡太爺推了出來。</p>
<p>胡太爺坐起上半身靠著枕，他從湖縐的帳門中偸窺姨太太的動靜；姨太太是背向着帳門，那個賭氣的樣子胡太爺知道誰走了風，那個女人一定被劉媽說活了。想着這，胡太爺心里開了花，但是他咳了聲嗽，幽幽地說：</p>
<p>「何必生氣呢？我又不存心娶她進門，玩一下子就算了……」</p>
<p>「哼！姨太太從沙發上跳了起來：「別做你的夢吧！誰高興來吃這乾醋？阿根上了吊，你的寳貝當差在門外等了二個多鐘頭呢！」姨太太最後竟是放聲喊起來。</p>
<p>胡太爺這才跳了起來，「眞有這般事嗎？阿二在那里？」他從床角落里搶過長袍，跨下床來。</p>
<p>阿二從門外閃了進來，他低着頭，垂着手，不知胡太爺到底站在那里，對着床說話：「胡太爺，小的照着吩咐到阿根家里去，他說糶了穀五十塊錢一定歸還，求小的對太爺說好話，把他老婆放回去。太爺吩咐的，不能這樣答應…他昨晚上床吊死了……」</p>
<p>「混蛋！混蛋！」胡太爺趿着拖鞋在房里打旋，「這點小事都幹不來，還有臉來見我！以後怎末樣？快說！快說！」</p>
<p>「他們已報了局……」阿二退後了幾步，提防胡太爺要打他似的。</p>
<p>「唔！」胡太爺斗地站定了，高闊的眉毛打了結，眼睛里彷彿冒着火星，他望望姨太太站在床前仰起了頭，阿二却退到門檻邊了，胡太爺用自己的拳頭鑿着自己的手掌「混蛋！混蛋，還站着幹麽？快拿我的名片到局里去！」一邊對姨太太說：「再拿五十塊錢給阿二，對局長說！我馬上到局里來！」</p>
<p>「五十塊錢沒有收來，反要化五十塊錢嗎？」姨太太冷笑着。</p>
<p>「多說什麽！」胡太爺把地板頓得蹦蹦地「混蛋！混蛋！」</p>
<h3>小茶館</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>——古城印象記</p>
<p>在灰色的街上，獨有着小茶館是明顯地點綴着灰色的，寂寞的；一塊塗上金黄色油漆的市招，灰灰地剝落着，色彩和調子，顯著着那麽灰灰的，寂寞的</p>
<p>在一邊是賣開水的，灰色的壁和灰色的灶晒在明朗的陽光裏面。平時有着一二個女人和孩子們，手中提了一把銅壺上街去買水的，當銅子在竹筒裏寂寞地響了一下；那一個高大男子，永遠是擺着這一副平凡的嘴臉，替他們勺上了一壺開水，不聲不響地放好了勺子。寂寞地在爐灶邊站着，聽着茶客們有趣地講着市井瑣聞，或是在灶肚子裏加一點煤。有時逢着女人們，也知趣地同她們搭訕，同她們調情。</p>
<p>在那灰灰的圓柱子上面，貼着一張褪了色的紅紙條兒，上面是用着描紅的手筆寫着二個斗大的「理髮」的字眼。有時我們可以看見那紅紙條兒寂實地隨着風飄；在那紅紙條下面，是一個年靑的小夥子，在胸前圍上一條白色的布裙，在上面抹着直一條和歪一條的許多鼻涕，那是個理髮師。他是寂寞者的吧，我們可以看到他的一對眼睛賊忒忒地知道那一個買水女人的美麗呢。</p>
<p>許多茶客的一張嘴和一對眼睛，也許永遠是灰色和寂寞的；他們在小茶館裏添上了灰色的資料，興添上了灰色的寂寞呵。他們每一個人憧憬着江南的美麗和著名的上海，在他們心的深處，藏着這一種美麗的金礦，同卑鄙的希望吧。</p>
<p>在這裏面的茶客，大多是一些偸鷄換毛之流的小商人，也有着一二個流浪人和粗野高大的小車夫。每天讓灰色寂寞的歲月在灰色寂寞的小茶館裏消磨。他們談着女人趣話和市井瑣聞——有趣地談着女人們時，他們會卑鄙地笑着、。有時聽着同神話一般的無稽的市井瑣聞時！大家都關心地問着，說着，那些小車夫們粗野的嘩笑點綴在周遭。</p>
<p>在這裏面，小車夫們是最率直，粗魯的，他們沒有一句有趣的話總會藏在心中的；他們會低低地，細細說着他們女人　他們自己的有趣的故事，而添作笑料　；在他們——小　夫們——心中，只靈要着一點溫馨的安慰呢。</p>
<p>夫，每天，他們這抱屈着生長在灰色　天下和灰色的古城裏面；有一個流浪　會說着這古城灰色的寂寞會蛀蝕着　　的生命和　　的，於是他們都憧憬着遼還的美麗的水鄕江南和繁華的上海了，只有這是他們的談資最生色，豐富和複雜的哪，他們是羨慕着上海的奢侈，同時也希冀着到上海或江南去盤桓上大半年呢。在灰色的生命中，人是需要著一點點溫馨的吧。</p>
<p>每天說着上海的見聞，那個知趣，臉孔　得扁扁的，矮矮底個子的堂倌，他會低低地附和着，那一對張大的眼珠裏是憧憬着上海呢。一到黄昏，茶客是絡綴地踏上灰色的街和小巷子裏，回到灰色的家裏去。在小茶館裏只留下那一個寂寞的堂倌，整理着桌面狼藉着的茶盤，同爐灶子上的開水在寂寞　響着。</p>
<h3>紫葡萄的誘惑</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>這是個小型古樸風的園林，有白楊，有丹楓，有銀杏，有靑石砌成的幽徑，有松桿搭成的葡萄架，每天，當一抹糜軟的秋末的夕　　上文魁閣第三層朱欄的時候，我便有着一集詩選，幾支淡味的姻捲和一個閒逸的情緒，在生滿野　菜，陀蔓蘿花藤…的小池　踱着了。</p>
<p>在這裏，我遭受不着色欲的迷惑，富貴的威脅，我可以作一切私願的遐想，任意撥起一些已往的回憶，不論是甜的，辛酸的？或是黄連般的苦味，我總認爲一種刺激，讓麻痺痺的生命顫動一回。偶爾亦可倚着陰凉的假山石唱一支凄淸的心曲，秋雲是淡薄的，人情也是淡薄的，眞不知有多少次，我被虛僞騙去了熱情，騙去哀怨的淚。淚，現在我可惜這種生理的分泌液了。</p>
<p>草木經過季節風的撫摩，愈顯得頹衰而蒼老，白楊落了一池的頭髪，丹楓被吹紅了臉，老大的梧桐葉片不住地在園徑上滾，呵，我是看它們萌芽的，我是看它們在夏季爲人們遮蔽了烈陽，而現在，我又看它們凋零，凋零，多麽快呵，這過程祗似乎從早晨到夜！以前坐在它們濃蔭下喁喁情語的男女呢？我想去找回他們，讓他們再倚嚐在頹殘的枝桿下，相顧而嘆息。</p>
<p>這時候，我對生物的空虛，不免起了哀怨之感，我需要一些果實的慰安，那株雄性的銀杏不結子，一片焦葉黏貼在廊簷下的蛛網上，噓噓地在秋晚的凉風裏輕鳴，這音韻顯得多麼空洞，這園林裏不結一個果，每天總帶着空洞的意念尋訪，沒有，沒有……蔓陀蘿的褐色的子亦已爆裂埋進了泥土。</p>
<p>前天，前天可是意外的發見，當我抽着一支淺味的烟捲在葡萄架下小坐的時候，我突然受到一種誘惑，一串紫色的葡萄半掩在焦黄的叢葉間，我數着，一顆，二顆，三顆……纍纍然擠在一起，也數不淸，我再細細的審察，那邊又是一串，那邊又是一串，一串一串紫色的透明的顆粒，這不是秋末的豐富的果實嗎，這小園林裏又何嘗空虛！</p>
<p>當晚，我有一個美滿的夢：世界的每個角落都包含着充實的成份，人生的每個枝節都懸着鮮熟的果實，祇等待人一們自己去發掘，去找尋，去飽嗜恰如已意的甜漿。……</p>
<p>（不錯的，世上一切事物都含有如紫葡萄般晶瑩而光潔的誘惑性，尤其是在將吿成熟的時期，可是人們偏急不及待的把那尙未成熟，靑色而帶酸澀味的果實摘吞了，於是人們便起了兩種悲嘆：嘆在世上做人祇嗜到了皺眉的酸澀味，嘆到了眞正果熟的季節，反不見多量熱甜的果實，以勻配自己的希求，因此，前者是失望，後者也是失望。）</p>
<p>然而，自己又豈是有耐性的人呢。在未發現紫葡萄成熟於藤架上之前，我總認這小型古樸風林的　是空虛的。</p>

<p>夜月之歌</p>
<p>耶兒深深，人兒靜靜，風兒輕輕，星兒明明。半　的白雲，把那光明燦爛的明月，籠罩罩乾凈。一片昏昏沉沉的晚景，誰都不愜心。願我們努力著前程！揭開那白雲，讓那明明亮亮，白白凈凈的明月，衝出那白雲，照鑒著世界黑暗，產生了絕處光明。不願那月兒灣，不願那月兒沉，願天上明月，永遠處光明燦爛，燦爛光明。</p>
<p>夜兒迢迢，蟲兒聲聲，風兒蕭蕭，星兒晶晶。臨空的浮雲，把那光明燦爛的明月，遮蓋了乾凈。一段寂寂清清的晚景，誰都不開心。願我們振起那精神！打開那浮雲，讓那清清秀秀，團團圓圓的明月，湧出那浮雲，鑒照着世界黑暗，產生了絕處光明。不願那月兒灣，不願那月兒沉，願天上明月，永遠地光明燦爛，燦爛光明。</p>

<h3>The Closing of the Sixth Plenary Session Yesterday: Chairman Yu Youren Delivers Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>The Session Concluded Successfully; National Crisis is Severe and Requires Sincere Unity</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sixth Plenary Session, after opening on the 1st, held a total of five days of meetings. All agenda items were discussed and completed. At 9:00 AM on the 6th, the closing ceremony was held in the Central Auditorium. Central Committee members Jiang Zhongzheng, Lin Sen, Fang Juehui, Ding Chaowu, Chen Gongbo, Chen Ce, Zhao Pilian, Zhang Xueliang, Jing Xiangyi, Qian Dajun, Cai Yuanpei, Huang Fusheng, Li Wenfan, Liu Yazi, Sun Ke, Zhu Jiahua, Duan Xipeng, He Yingqin, Dai Kuisheng, Chen Shuren, Wang Boqun, Bai Wenwei, Chen Qingyun, Wang Maogong, Zhu Peide, Mao Zuquan, Shi Ying, Liang Hancao, Yu Youren, Zhang Zhiben, Deng Feihuang, Zhang Zhen, Xiao Zhongzhen, Cheng Qian, Qin Zhen, Gu Zhenggang, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Wang Qi, Zhang Ji, Zhou Fo hai, Xia Douyin, Liu Shouchong, Shao Yuanchong, Xie Zuomin, Chen Zhaoying, Li Jingzhai, Sun Jingya, Lu Zhonglin, Xue Dubi, Deng Qingyang, Huang Shaoxiong, Gan Naiguang, Hong Ludong, Kong Xiangxi, Gui Chongji, Fu Rulin, Yuan Suren, Guo Chuntao, Li Zonghuang, Jiao Yitang, Yang Hu, He Chengjun, Kexinge, Miao Peicheng, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, Chen Guofu, Luo Jialun, Xiao Jishan, Ji Liang, Cui Guangxiu, Zeng Yangfu, Ju Zheng, Zeng Kuoqing, Li Ciwen, Wang Luyi, Huang Jilu, Li Fulin, Enkeguo, Zhang Qun, Zhou Qigang, and others, totaling eighty-five people, as well as over two hundred Central Party Headquarters staff members, attended. Chairman Yu Youren led the ceremony and then delivered the closing address, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, this plenary session has been held for five days. Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members, with the exception of those far overseas and a small number of officers directly commanding bandit suppression, have almost all attended, making it a grand gathering of the Fourth Central Committee's first meeting. This enthusiastic atmosphere encouraged the progress of the meeting, and everyone felt boundless excitement, fully demonstrating the historical spirit of sincere unity within the party. The process can be said to have been exceptionally successful. What is regrettable is that on the opening day, a sudden incident occurred where a rogue infiltrated and fired shots, injuring Committee Member Wang, preventing him from attending the meeting. Such a rogue who harms the party and the country is truly the object of universal indignation within our party. Committee Member Wang, with the sacrificial spirit of a revolutionary, shouldered the difficulties of the nation, placing his personal safety aside. When we recall the times our party's important comrades encountered danger and sacrifice since Premier Sun Yat-sen led the revolution, it further proves that our party's revolution, whenever it develops to a new stage, will inevitably have reactionary forces who wish to destroy our party and be content. To complete our predestined mission, every comrade must carry on the spirit left by the Premier and the martyrs, and be prepared to sacrifice everything personally. Currently, Committee Member Wang's injury treatment is progressing very well. We are all relieved and sincerely hope for his speedy recovery, so that he can continue to work hard for the party and the country. The mission of the plenary session is to review the past and plan for the future. The Sixth Plenary Session is less than ten days away from the opening of the Fifth National Congress, and it is indeed the last plenary session of the Fourth Central Committee. Therefore, our work is to conclude previous proposals and review past facts. Regarding party affairs, politics, education, and the economy, we have also discussed several proposals, but the future implementation of major party and government plans should be left for the Fifth National Congress to discuss and decide. Therefore, this time, in addition to announcing the meeting's proceedings, we will not issue a separate closing declaration. We have reviewed the situation in the ten months since the Fifth Plenary Session and deeply feel that the nation's and the people's situation is becoming more and more precarious. In these ten months, although compatriots nationwide and party members have done their best in all aspects, and national construction and social forces have shown considerable progress, bandit suppression military affairs and pacification work have also achieved many successes, but water and drought disasters have followed one after another, and the tense international environment and the impact of global economic changes have made our country, which is in a severe national crisis, face increasing difficulties every day. We cannot deny the hardships and struggles of the entire nation in these ten months, but we must point out that to overcome this extremely difficult period, we still need more sincere unity and tenfold, hundredfold efforts. To save the nation and ensure its survival, we must concentrate national strength and enrich the people's strength, using our own struggles to save the difficult environment. This is the policy decided by the Central Committee for several years and is indeed a definite truth. Since the Third Plenary Session decided to convene the National Assembly and draft the constitution, after the Legislative Yuan drafted, solicited, discussed, and revised various procedures, the Fifth Plenary Session handed it over to the Standing Committee for review and the Legislative Yuan for further revision. Recently, the Legislative Yuan sent the revised version to the Sixth Plenary Session. Colleagues at the meeting felt that promulgating the constitution, a grand plan for the nation's centuries, is a matter that should be taken very seriously. It was decided to send the draft to the Fifth National Congress for guidance and to consider a longer period of intensive research to achieve perfection. But on the other hand, we feel that to enhance the national ambition and willingness to struggle together, we must implement constitutional government as soon as possible. Therefore, it was also decided to suggest that the Fifth National Congress first decide on the date of convening the National Assembly to refresh the public's perception, so that our goal of concentrating national strength can be fully realized. Judging from the recent trend of opinion, the public is gradually increasing its understanding of our party's proposition of revolution to save the country. After the implementation of constitutional government, it will surely have a great effect on saving the nation and reviving the nation. This is a point that colleagues at this meeting deeply believe in. Starting from enriching national strength and cultivating popular strength is certainly a matter with thousands of threads. We expect that the Fifth National Congress will have extremely detailed decisions, but the most important key is to make the national economy sound. In the past one or two years, amidst the heavy national crisis, we have also felt a severe economic crisis. Without saving the economic crisis, there is no way to talk about enriching national strength to save the nation and ensure its survival. Recently, we have made more efforts to stabilize it. If all industries, whether in urban or rural areas, continue to collapse, they will be beyond saving. Therefore, this meeting did not wait for the Fifth National Congress but accepted the government's financial authorities' currency reform plan of unified issuance and centralized reserves. Since the promulgation of this plan, societies in various places have been able to follow it peacefully in the face of such an unprecedented reform. The financial community and the government echoed each other and worked together. This cannot be said to be a kind of progress in our people's acceptance of national policies. Based on this spirit of unity from top to bottom, we should further seek the active construction of the national economy and sacrifice with hard work and endurance. China will surely be able to revive through its own efforts. This is the second point that colleagues at this meeting deeply believe in. Combining the points reported above, the current environment of our nation is indeed extremely dangerous, with survival hanging by a thread. At the same time, we dare to assert that compatriots nationwide have indeed deeply realized the necessity of united struggle. I hope everyone understands the current situation, increases our self-confidence, follows Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, vows to be diligent and brave, and works hard to complete our mission of revolution to save the country."

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and all directors and supervisors, had previously submitted their resignations to the ministry. After being persuaded to stay, they resubmitted their resignations, citing the lack of practical solutions for repaying old debts and cash flow. The ministry believes that since the company was nationalized, the directors and supervisors have presided over planning for many years, demonstrating commendable hard work. Currently, they are actively reorganizing and relying on positive shares. Moreover, the state-run business is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The directors and supervisors should continue their efforts and bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility. A telegram has been sent to Liu Hongsheng, and separate telegrams have been sent to the directors and supervisors, persuading them to stay. As for the debt portion, a detailed plan will be drafted and a proper solution will be determined. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>The Southwest Political Council: Meeting with Dai and Ma Yesterday; Feng Yuxiang Will Fly to Guangzhou Soon</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dai and Ma are still in consultation with the Guangdong Committee on various matters. As of the evening of the 5th, no decision had been reached. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, the Political Council convened a meeting to discuss. Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, etc., all attended. The meeting concluded at 12:00 PM. After the meeting, Ma met with reporters and talked about the mission to the south: 1. To report on the central government's domestic and foreign policies over the past few years. 2. To invite veteran comrades from the southwest to attend the Fifth National Congress in Nanjing. The results of our visit to Guangzhou are still satisfactory. The future is certain and there is a glimmer of hope. More Southwest Central Committee members will go to Nanjing to attend the Fifth National Congress. The identity of these people is still under discussion. We will wait a few more days and go north together. It is reported that Hu has left France for the United States. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun continued to visit Chen Jitang and Li Zongren at 9:00 AM on the 6th. They left after talking for an hour and went to the Provincial Party Headquarters for inspection. At 5:00 PM, the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters hosted a banquet for Dai and Ma at the hotel. Chen Jitang plans to send Lin Yizhong as a representative to Nanjing. Feng Yuxiang is scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the 10th to persuade Chen and Li to go to Nanjing. Chen and Li telegraphed Feng to welcome him to Guangzhou. Lin Yunhai and Lin Yizhong are scheduled to lead the Guangzhou Fifth National Congress representatives to Hong Kong on the 7th and then go to Nanjing to attend. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Dai Jitao and Ma Chaojun's mission to Guangzhou to promote cooperation between Nanjing and Guangdong is now gradually taking effect. It is now known that after Dai and Ma had a day of discussions with the leaders of the southwest, Li Zongren has decided to go to Nanjing to participate in the Fifth National Congress. He will travel with the Nanjing representatives to Nanjing on or around November 7th or 8th. It is expected that Chen Jitang will also send a representative to Nanjing to attend the meeting. Dai and Ma are scheduled to return to Nanjing by the Ford aircraft that brought them to Guangzhou today. It is evident that Dai and Ma will stay in Guangzhou for at least a few more days to await the decisions of the various important figures in the southwest. After the Nanjing representatives visited the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang, they attended a banquet hosted by Chen Jitang and Zou Lu. Dai Jitao explained the views of Nanjing in detail at the meeting of the Southwest Political Committee, repeatedly stating the earnest hope for national unity. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>

Recently, due to the rapid changes in the situation, the rebellious people who occupied Xianghe County for a total of sixteen days have agreed to return the county administration. The Hebei Provincial Government sent Commissioner Kobayashi, a Japanese, and Jinjing, an advisor to the Ji-Mi District Office, to negotiate with the rebellious people. A decision has been made on the solution to the Xianghe issue. The county residents have now released Liu Yaodong, the counselor sent by the Provincial Government to act as the County Magistrate. After being released, Liu came to Shang Zhen in Beiping this morning to report everything. The Provincial Government has internally decided on the successor to the Xianghe County Magistrate and will announce it soon. The security team stationed outside the county to monitor the rebellious people is not needed to enter the city.

<h3>Prospects for Currency Management</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>It has been four days since the government managed the currency and centralized cash. In the past three days, although the market is still uneasy, there has been no panic or disturbance as before the announcement. The financial situation is gradually stabilizing. However, ordinary family life suddenly feels that "foreign prices are low, but domestic prices are high." This is indeed a temporary phenomenon. There is no reform without pain. After a series of changes, we should seek industrial recovery and price stability, so that life is enjoyable. Why should we hesitate to endure temporary pain? However, if prices rise and purchasing power cannot keep up, resulting in a situation where higher prices lead to weaker purchasing power, it is also worrying. Some say that this will never happen. As prices rise and production develops, how can purchasing power not increase? It should be noted that among the majority of Chinese people who only seek enjoyment and do not engage in production, the occurrence of this unfortunate phenomenon is quite possible. Thereafter, if the financial activities focus solely on supporting the real estate industry, how much benefit will it bring to the overall issue of industrial recovery? It is questionable. If real estate speculation were to revive, what benefits would it bring to industrialists and businessmen? It is not difficult to know by looking back.</p>
<p>However, if our country's finances follow the past, without major changes, the exchange rate will be stable, prices will be stable, speculation in foreign exchange will be reduced, and funds for legitimate businesses will be available. Everything may gradually get on the right track. However, this still requires great effort.</p>
<p>China has a vast territory, and the success of a reform is not as easy as in other countries. However, without external destruction, there will eventually be a day of success. British banks have been ordered by their government to cooperate with us. Although the US government is unwilling to indicate whether it will advise American overseas Chinese to cooperate with the Chinese government, it has stated that it will continue its previous promises to China and do its best to avoid interfering with the Chinese government's recent efforts to stabilize the currency. It is unwilling to disrupt world silver prices during this period. It can be seen that the United States is at least willing to cooperate indirectly. However, Japan has not yet made a clear statement. If what its embassy has said is true, that the Japanese government will cancel its positive attitude towards whether Japanese banks in China will cooperate with us and is unwilling to guarantee them, then this is something to be deeply regretted. China and Japan are seeking friendship, and Japan should assist China's legitimate reforms. Moreover, a stable exchange rate is beneficial to trade between the two countries. Why does it still hold narrow-minded views and attempt to monopolize, and become uneasy because the Japanese exchange rate has fallen from 130 or 140 yuan to 103 yuan?</p>
<p>Before the centralization of silver, smuggling was rampant in Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Shanghai, Xiamen, and other places. According to the price of silver in London, the value of one yuan is still more than 60% of its face value. Where there is great profit, it is hard to guarantee that there will be no organized trafficking. This is indeed a great obstacle to our current silver centralization. Now, a difficult task is placed on the shoulders of our Chinese people. People are using our ability to overcome all difficulties, dispel suspicions, and maintain credit as a standard for observing the future of our country's currency. How can we be complacent and not know how to encourage ourselves?</p>
<h3>Continuing Discussions Between Britain and Italy to Ease Mediterranean Tensions</h3>
<p>Rome Publishes Communiqué, Talks Friendly; Italian Troop Withdrawal Conditioned on British Ship Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini received British Ambassador Sir Drummond in the afternoon and subsequently issued an official communiqué stating that the meeting involved discussions on the Anglo-Italian situation in the Mediterranean. According to this newspaper's correspondent, the two men explored ways to improve relations between the two countries. Drummond requested that Italy continue to withdraw troops stationed in Libya. The two also discussed the upcoming London Naval Conference, with particular emphasis on the basis for a new naval balance in the Mediterranean. According to semi-official sources, Mussolini stated to Drummond that Italy had already withdrawn one division of troops from Libya, while Drummond explained that Britain still did not have grounds to reduce its naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The general public had a favorable impression of the talks, and political circles pointed out that although the repeated meetings between the Italian Prime Minister and the British Ambassador had not outwardly yielded concrete results, they were bound to bring about progress in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Ambassador Drummond continued their discussions on the Mediterranean situation today, but without any resolution. According to a communiqué, Mr. Mussolini mentioned that Italy had withdrawn one division of Italian troops from Libya, after which Drummond expressed the British government's admiration for this action. However, he stated that the number of Italian troops stationed in Libya still outnumbered the British and Egyptian troops in Egypt by approximately three times, and therefore the British government did not believe that this situation warranted the withdrawal of British naval vessels from the Mediterranean. The presence of the British fleet in the Mediterranean was purely for precautionary purposes. The talks were generally friendly, but the Italian side's spokesperson did not express excessive optimism. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Advocates Expanding Scope of Talks; Demands Naval Parity in Mediterranean</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that during a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Ambassador Sir Drummond in Rome today, they discussed steps that could be taken to ease tensions in the Mediterranean. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources explained that if Italian newspapers continued to engage in anti-British propaganda, and if the Italian troops stationed in Libya did not withdraw another division, Britain would not reduce the number of its naval vessels in the Mediterranean. However, if Italy were to comply, Britain not only intended to recall the two large battleships "Hotspur" and "Renown" to their home country, but might also recall a squadron of cruisers and torpedo boats. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to expand the scope of the talks and raise the issue of naval parity in the Mediterranean for discussion. Regarding this matter, official circles stated that the only current issue was restoring peace in Africa, and nothing else was under consideration. Although naval experts from Britain and Italy were scheduled to begin talks tomorrow, their nature would also be strictly limited to preparations for the naval conference to be held on December 2nd. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Italy Agrees to Further Withdrawal of Libyan Troops; Anglo-French Cooperation in Negotiations Sees Progress</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, regarding the troop withdrawal issue between Britain and Italy, if Italy agreed to reduce the number of troops stationed in Libya, there was a possibility that Britain's navy stationed in the Mediterranean might withdraw two or even more warships. Prime Minister Baldwin convened several cabinet members yesterday for discussion. According to the News Chronicle, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had already accepted the further withdrawal of two divisions of troops stationed in Libya, bringing the total number of troops withdrawn to 30,000, but on the condition that Britain recall several warships stationed in the Mediterranean. Regarding this matter, the Morning Post believed that Britain would not consider reducing the number of naval vessels in the Mediterranean until the issue of naval cooperation with France had reached complete agreement. According to reports, French naval experts Admiral Darlan and Colonel Roux had come to Britain to discuss the cooperation issue, and significant progress had been made. Only a few points remained unresolved. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Britain Harboring Three Types of Fears; Employing Strategies to Alienate Italy and France</p>
<p>(Rome) According to official sources here, the main purpose of the negotiations currently being conducted by Britain and Italy outside the League of Nations is not to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but to resolve the difficult situation in the Mediterranean. A prominent figure here recently expressed to a Havas reporter that "After the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the British government adopted an unprecedentedly harsh attitude towards Italy, which was due to three types of fears harbored by Britain. First, it was deeply concerned that after Italy succeeded in Abyssinia, it would train an army of 500,000 Abyssinian troops between British Egypt and the British Sudan and the Red Sea, making it the most powerful army in Africa. Second, it was afraid that the Italian navy would continue to develop. Third, it was afraid that the friendship between France and Italy would increasingly improve, thereby endangering Britain. Because of these three types of fears, Britain urged the League of Nations to take the strongest possible action to prevent Italy's power from extending into Abyssinia, and Italy has always believed that Britain's original intention was to take military sanctions. Britain believed that only by using naval pressure on Italy could Britain's three types of fears be completely dispelled. Later, because the military sanctions policy failed to gain the agreement of all countries, it failed. Britain then turned to negotiations, hoping to seek compensation in two areas: creating a balance of power in the Mediterranean and alienating Franco-Italian relations. According to this newspaper's correspondent, the British government is indeed currently pursuing the above-mentioned policy. If Britain and Italy can reach a compromise on the Mediterranean issue, then the Abyssinian problem will not be difficult to solve." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Navy Plans to Establish New Base in Mediterranean; British and Italian Experts Hold Talks in London in Preparation for Future Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to the London correspondent of the Tribune, the British Admiralty plans to discuss with Italian naval experts the establishment of a new system of British naval bases in the Mediterranean to protect the Suez Canal and the Mosul oil pipeline in case of unforeseen events. Currently, the British navy's main bases in the Mediterranean are the Strait of Gibraltar and Malta, which are both very far from Singapore. According to the proposed new system, the British fleet could be concentrated in the eastern Mediterranean, which is closer to Singapore. According to the correspondent, the British navy has already been building new bases near the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, such as on Perim Island, so the above plan is already being implemented. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian naval experts, including Rear Admiral Piscia and Captain Magguttini, arrived here this evening and will hold talks with British experts in preparation for the future naval conference. Officials stated that these talks are absolutely unrelated to the current situation in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Economic Sanctions Against Italy; Expansion of Scope of Embargoed Goods; Oil, Coal, and Steel All Included in Embargo List; 18-Member Committee to Present for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 18-member committee will present concrete proposals tonight to ban the transport of oil, coal and steel to Italy. It is now expected that when enough countries have approved of the proposal to make it effective, it will be decided when to implement it. The main business of today's committee will be to consider the reports of the five-member subcommittee regarding discussions of various technical issues arising from the implementation of sanctions. Eden and others have returned home to campaign for elections, so British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Stanhope, will arrive in Geneva today to represent the British government at the meeting of the 18-member committee. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) General agreement has been reached today on various outstanding issues regarding the implementation of sanctions against Italy, such as the difficulties of transit, clearing contracts and currency contracts. The 18-member committee will be able to approve the resolutions established by the subcommittees when it meets tonight. The transit subcommittee has found a solution today to the problem of preventing major items from being transported to other countries and then to Italy in order to circumvent the ban. The subcommittee maintains that countries participating in the sanctions need not apply quotas, but that member states must find ways to manage the destinations of prohibited goods. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Economic Sanctions Subcommittee today passed a resolution stipulating that, starting November 18, steel, oil, coal and iron will also be added to the list of major products embargoed against Italy. However, this requires cooperation from Germany and the United States. The proposal was made by the Canadian representative at today's meeting, at which the Chilean representative opposed it, calling it impractical. Most diplomats here said that US law could not prohibit the export of these four items, and that if the League of Nations passed this resolution, it would be asking for the US to reject it. However, those who supported the proposal believed that Italian aircraft might not be able to fly due to lack of gasoline, so it might be worth a try. Furthermore, Italian tanks would not be able to move forward without oil, Italian ships would not be able to sail without coal, and various arms industries would come to a standstill without steel, as Italy's war machine relied entirely on other countries for raw materials. (National Society, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Sanctions Committee of the 18-Nation Committee recently discussed the draft resolution submitted by the Barter Issues Subcommittee, stipulating that all governments should cease to implement barter agreements with Italy no later than November 18, and that from that date onwards, the acceptance of deposits in various Italian currencies for the purpose of paying for exports to Italy should be prohibited. After discussion, the Dutch representative submitted an amendment, and the committee decided to send the original draft resolution, along with the amendment, to the subcommittee for reconsideration. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Give Unusual Importance to Oil Embargo Plan; Believe That It Cannot Succeed Without US and German Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) Political figures here attach great importance to the League of Nations' plan to embargo oil against Italy. According to an investigation of 1934, Italy's oil refining consumption reached 422,000 tons, gas oil consumption reached 226,000 tons, lubricating oil consumption reached 251,000 tons, and gasoline consumption reached 1.63 million tons. Since the military action, the consumption of various oils has increased even more. If the source of oil to Italy is to be cut off, it will not succeed without the United States banning oil transport. But apart from implementing a blockade against Italy to prevent American oil from entering, it is questionable whether the United States is willing to participate in the embargo. Even if the United States participates in the embargo, other countries can transport kerosene through Austria to enter Italy (because Austria has not participated in the sanctions). If this is the case, then the embargo on oil against Italy may be difficult to achieve. In addition, Albania provides Italy with approximately 500,000 tons of crude oil each year, the quality of which is equivalent to that produced in Romania. Italian oil companies enjoy the concession rights to the oil wells in Sissesarani and Divoli in Albania, and the oil produced is transported through a 70-kilometer pipeline to the Adriatic coast near Fiero, and then transported to Italy. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italy Employs Thrift to Resist Economic Sanctions; Soaring Oil Prices Cause Public Complaints</h3>
<p>(Rome) Starting today, Italy is adopting various strict measures nationwide to resist economic sanctions against Italy. Butcher shops in various places will be closed for two days today and tomorrow to reduce meat consumption. People across the country will uniformly advance their living time by one hour to reduce electricity consumption. Except for electric railways, trains in various places will reduce the number of runs to save coal used by the railways. Foreign films and foreign books and newspapers will be uniformly boycotted. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the price of gasoline in Italy has risen from 51 pence per gallon to 64 pence. The price two months ago was 34 pence. According to orders from the authorities, the price increase is for the purpose of saving, but in reality, it is affected by the League of Nations' sanctions. Motorists in particular have many complaints about this. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Postponed; Opening Changed to December 5</h3>
<p>(London) The naval conference originally scheduled to open here on December 2 has now been changed to December 5 because the Japanese representative is unable to arrive in London in time. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Naval Conference, originally scheduled to open on December 2, has now been postponed to December 5 because the Japanese government informed the United States that the Japanese representatives attending the Naval Conference could not arrive in London before December 4. Therefore, Britain decided to postpone the conference to December 5. Furthermore, the French government's official reply accepting participation in the Naval Conference was delivered to London today. At the same time, the Indian government has also agreed to send representatives to the conference. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Italian Troops in the North Advance in the Rain</h3>
<p>Vanguard Once Entered Magal City; Abyssinian Army Counterattacks at Night to Repel Enemy</p>
<p>Abyssinia, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, O'Shaughnessy, reports: The Abyssinian government issued a communiqué late yesterday, officially announcing that a vanguard team of Italian troops had once entered the city of Magal. After the Abyssinian army launched a night counterattack, they forced the Italian troops to withdraw from the city. In this battle, ten Italian soldiers were killed and four captured. Two Abyssinian soldiers were killed and two wounded. At present, Magal City is still in the hands of the Abyssinian army. As for the southern town of Gorahei, it was bombed by Italian planes, injuring seven Abyssinian soldiers. Italian troops also attacked Abyssinian guard posts near the Webe Shebelle River. After fierce resistance, the Abyssinian army was forced to retreat. According to this newspaper's special correspondent, Italian troops will soon launch a large-scale offensive against Magal City, but the Abyssinian army has transported a batch of military supplies from abroad and is now stepping up preparations to resist. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to semi-official sources today, heavy rain has hampered the Italian army's progress, especially for the heavy artillery units. However, this obstacle is not expected to disrupt the Italian army's plans. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Italian Troops at the Northern Front: Although heavy rain has prevented Italian troops from attacking Magal, they will continue to advance after the road construction is completed and military supplies are delivered. The weather impeding the Italian army is completely abnormal, with thick clouds and heavy rain, even causing the Italian soldiers to fear the cold. The territory now occupied by the Italian army has increased by 4,300 square miles. The town of Ho-Hsing, captured yesterday, is an important junction where five camel routes converge. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Asmara: Despite the extremely harsh weather, Italian troops at the northern front continued to advance today toward their main target, Magal. In the afternoon, they advanced to Agra, 16 miles north of the city. The troops advancing from Adigrat, Adowa, and Axum are scheduled to meet here. It is now expected that the main force of the Italian army will occupy Magal on Sunday. There was a heavy thunderstorm today, and the mountainsides became torrents. The Italian troops traveled on rugged paths with great difficulty, but the soldiers still marched in the rain all day long. By the time they reached Agra, they were soaked to the skin. The Italian army uses more than 7,000 mules, donkeys, and camels to transport food to the forward positions. There are also hundreds of trucks shuttling back and forth. It is reported that the bishop of Magal City has raised a white flag and it is expected that the entire clergy will surrender to the Italian army. Taigas, the chairman of the Agam region, surrendered to the Italian army headquarters today. It is expected that more minor chairmen will continue to surrender. The previous rumor that the wife and family members of Abyssinian commander Kufsa, who had surrendered to the Italian army, had all been slaughtered has not been verified. Well-informed sources indicate that this statement is completely unfounded. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Wogga Garden Front: Abyssinian Army Fortifies Positions</h3>
<p>King Prepares to Depart for Personal Command; Northern Strategy Lures Enemy Deep</p>
<p>Abyssinia: Today, twenty cargo trucks loaded with various materials drove to Taishi City to repair the bridges that were destroyed by floods for two seasons, so that when the Abyssinian Emperor went on a personal expedition, the large army could pass through. It is reported that the Abyssinian Emperor will have 500 donkeys carrying butter, wine, military supplies and silk money. According to private sources, the Abyssinian army has built strong fortifications on the Wogga Garden front and is preparing to fight when the Italian army attacks. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia: Some officials here stated today that although Abyssinia had previously stated that it did not intend to resist the Italian army's advance, Magal would still be defended. According to the plans of the Abyssinian Army, the defending army will not resist with all its strength, because Magal is not important in practice. Therefore, the Abyssinian army will wait until they reach a more important location before deciding on a victory or defeat. Abyssinia's slight resistance is apparently to appease the chiefs who are strongly advocating open warfare. Prince Makonnen will probably arrive here from Taishi within two or three days, after which the Abyssinian Emperor will personally go to the northern front. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Financial Assistance Hopeless; Abyssinia Raises Domestic Public Debt</h3>
<p>Haile Selassie Donates Large Sums as Advocate; Large Batch of Military Supplies to Arrive Successively</p>
<p>Abyssinia, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, O'Shaughnessy, reports: The Abyssinian Emperor recently adopted the suggestion of Haile Selassie, the former representative to the League of Nations and minister to France, to raise public debt throughout the country to fund the war effort. Haile Selassie was the first to donate a large sum of money and a piece of real estate to encourage others. Haile Selassie also plans to personally go to the Qalqel region tomorrow to sell all of his farm's harvests to replenish the country's treasury. According to officials, Abyssinia's request to the League of Nations for financial assistance is bound to be rejected, so it intends to raise public debt domestically instead. Furthermore, the Abyssinian government will soon prohibit the import of various Italian goods, with alcohol and automobiles being the largest categories. After various countries lifted their orders to stop the transport of military supplies to Abyssinia, a large batch of military supplies will arrive successively. Government officials are contacting representatives of military supply companies in various countries every day to place orders. In addition, the government will purchase a large batch of radio materials to increase the number of mobile military radio stations. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Egypt Actively Deploys Defenses</h3>
<p>Heavy Artillery Placed on Mountain Peaks; Auto Stations Built Posthaste</p>
<p>Cairo: The Egyptian government has taken important defensive measures. Heavy artillery has been deployed on the peaks of mountains near Suleim, and anti-aircraft guns have been installed. At the same time, the city of Marsa Matruh has also been fortified, as troops and military supplies will be concentrated in the city. Transportation agencies are busy repairing roads in the western desert. In addition, the government has allocated 100,000 pounds to build a car road from Cairo to Alexandria, which is 300 kilometers long. This road passes through Wadi and Natrun, which is of great benefit to local chemical industries in these areas, especially salt and nitrate products. Furthermore, 45 British warships recently set sail from Alexandria to participate in air force exercises. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance has decided to send Takeo Yumoto, Director of the Treasury Division of the Financial Bureau, and Masamichi Yamagiwa, Official of the Banking Bureau, to North China and Shanghai to study the issue of Chinese currency reform. (Nichi-Nichi Allied, 6th)</p>
<h3>British and American Observations: Chinese Currency Stabilized; Joining the Sterling Bloc Premature</h3>
<p>(London) Financial circles here are very supportive of China's move to devalue its currency by 40 percent, believing that a 40 percent devaluation is in line with the rate of devaluation of the pound sterling after Britain abandoned the gold standard. Some people believe that after the devaluation of the Chinese currency, it will join the pound sterling bloc, but it seems too early to make such an interpretation at present. Generally, it is believed that the decision taken by the Nanjing government this time is based on the monetary experience of most countries in recent years. Its intention is primarily to protect domestic silver reserves, second, to create a sound and stable monetary organization, and third, to protect the Chinese economy from foreign competition. As for joining the Sterling Bloc, it has not yet been considered. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senior officials and financial experts here believe that the Chinese government's nationalization of silver has gradually stabilized Chinese currency. In theory, it can promote trade relations between China and the United States, but it still depends on other components of this new policy to succeed. Businesses, because they can predict that exchange rates will no longer fluctuate, will of course carefully consider their interests. Furthermore, the Chinese side has long advocated that stable silver prices are more valuable than rising prices. However, the flow of capital and price reactions are very important for trade. The State Department and the Treasury Department stated again today that the United States has no immediate response to this. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Post stated in an editorial today regarding the Chinese government's nationalization of silver, "American silver senators have shamelessly stated that high silver prices can increase China's purchasing power. Now, they are not ashamed to attribute the results of this assistance to China and the restoration of silver prices." (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Golden Rivers Flowing into America</h3>
<p>Inflation Crisis Looms – Citibank Issues Warning</p>
<p>(New York) Citibank today reiterated its warning regarding potential credit inflation following the increase in domestic gold reserves. According to the bank's trade investigation report, if gold inflows into the United States exceed $475,000,000 in December, and concerning the excess reserves of the Federal Reserve Banks, this excess is neither normal nor sound, and a decline in currency value would be dangerous. The opportunity for inflation is already present. This can be seen by observing the gold inflows during the European war and the consequences of the Reserve Bank's currency purchase policy in 1927. The bank also believes that the unbalanced Federal government budget is a contributing factor to inflation. If the budget cannot be balanced, the authorities will find it difficult to curb inflation. If the Treasury Department raises funds from the market, the Federal Reserve Board will not have the freedom to act. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Head of US Economic Survey Mission – Opinions on China's Currency Policy</h3>
<p>The head of the American Far East Economic Survey Mission, Forbes, stated today that the written opinions submitted by Chinese bankers during the mission's visit to China foreshadowed the Chinese government's intention to nationalize silver. Regarding the future participation of the United States in the Chinese market, Forbes expressed optimism, differing significantly from the skepticism and pessimism of others. He stated that the mission members discovered many opportunities for Sino-American cooperation to restore China's finances and industries. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Major Cities in the Northeast – Native Banks Closing Doors in Succession – Result of Japanese and Puppet Financial Organization</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Since the currency unification implemented by the Japanese and Manchukuo, the exchange rate between "Manchukuo" currency and Japanese Yen has remained stable since September of this year. As a result, native bank businesses in major cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun have lost their business grounds, leading to the hardship of store closures. The puppet Ministry of Finance stated that previously sound native banks have been reorganized into new banks. Therefore, they can only passively observe the plight of the remaining native banks.

<h3>Japanese-Manchukuo Troops Invade Russian Territory – Full Text of Soviet Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>Kwantung Army Fully Responsible for Manchurian Defense – Japanese Government Cannot Shirk Responsibility for Disputes</p>
<p>(Moscow) On October 16th and 24th, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, protested to the Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota regarding the intrusion of armed Manchurian troops into Soviet territory in the Grodekovo region on October 6th, 8th, and 12th. On the 25th, Hirota submitted a reply. On November 4th, Yurenev submitted the following memorandum to Hirota:</p>
<p>"The point raised in Your Excellency's memorandum that the Soviet border guards engaged in illegal acts during the clashes on October 6th and 12th is entirely unfounded and is therefore rejected by the Soviet government. I have already stated in my memorandum of October 16th and 14th that these clashes occurred within Soviet territory and were caused by the illegal intrusion of Japanese-Manchukuo armed forces into Soviet territory and their attack on Soviet border guards. Your Excellency's memorandum of October 25th does not deny that these incidents occurred within Soviet territory.</p>
<p>"Your Excellency also stated that the Japanese-Manchukuo armed forces were present at the scene for the sole purpose of investigation. This point must also be rejected, as the Japanese-Manchukuo troops have no right to conduct investigations within Soviet territory. Furthermore, the claim that the Soviet guards opened fire on the Japanese-Manchukuo troops without warning is also untrue. The Soviet patrol team, consisting of two cavalrymen, first warned the Japanese-Manchukuo troops who had intruded into Soviet territory. The latter not only did not leave Soviet territory but also opened fire on the Soviet border guards, resulting in the death of Guard Kotnikov and injuries to the other two. In this situation, the Soviet guards were obligated to follow service regulations and open fire on the Japanese-Manchukuo troops who had intruded into the country and attacked them. Therefore, Your Excellency's protest against the actions of the Soviet border guards is completely unfounded. At the outset of the incident, the Soviet government knew that the fault lay with the Japanese-Manchukuo side, but it still sought to convince the Japanese government of this fact. Therefore, it suggested that both countries immediately send representatives to form a joint commission to investigate the incident at the site. The Soviet government must express its regret that the Japanese government believes that an investigation by a joint commission is unnecessary. In fact, this method is the best guarantee of impartial and accurate fact-finding. I am instructed by the Soviet government to remind Your Excellency that the Japanese government has not yet responded to the draft proposal submitted by me on August 17th for the establishment of a joint Soviet-Manchukuo border commission. This proposal would provide a practical way to quickly investigate border disputes similar to the clash on October 12th and prevent such disputes, which disrupt border tranquility and peace, from recurring.</p>
<p>Your Excellency also stated that the cause of such disputes lies in the unclear demarcation of the Soviet-Manchukuo border. This point is also completely untrue. The Soviet-Manchukuo border was long ago agreed upon in a treaty signed by China and Russia, with an attached map for clarification. Upon the establishment of Manchukuo, it declared that such treaties must still be observed. There can be no doubt about the border established by these treaties. Before the entry of Japanese troops into Manchuria, such disputes never occurred.</p>
<p>"Finally, the Japanese government believes that this matter should be addressed to the Manchukuo government. The Soviet government must express its disagreement on this point. The Soviet government has repeatedly drawn the Japanese government's attention to the fact that the Japanese government cannot evade responsibility for any actions taken by the Japanese-Manchukuo authorities against the Soviet Union, as the military deployment in Manchuria is entirely carried out by Japan, and the Kwantung Army is the de facto ruler of Manchuria. At the same time, any consequences of the Soviet-Manchukuo border disputes will directly affect Soviet-Japanese relations. Furthermore, in this incident, as Your Excellency has stated, Japanese soldiers participated in this clash within the Japanese-Manchukuo forces. This fact alone proves that Japan is a party to this incident. At the same time, Your Excellency's recognition that the Soviet side opened fire on the Japanese-Manchukuo troops without provocation and should be protested also proves that Japan initially could not exclude itself from this incident. For all these reasons, the Soviet government considers its protest of October 24th to be entirely justified." (5th TASS Telegram)</p>

Generally, hats must be straight and clothes must be tight to avoid developing lazy habits. Students wearing yellow uniforms should preferably wear leather belts to tighten them.

<h3>He Yingqin Talks About the Heavy Losses Suffered by Sichuan Bandits</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the communist bandits in Sichuan Province fled north, people generally believed that the bandits led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Xu Xiangqian had all fled into Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces. It was also rumored that the bandit suppression army in northern Shaanxi was slightly disadvantaged, and that our Wang Yizhe's army had engaged in several fierce battles with the bandits, with heavy casualties on both sides. It was said that He Lizhong, the division commander, and two regimental commanders had died in battle due to serious injuries. On the 6th, the reporter specifically visited He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, to inquire about the recent bandit disturbances. He replied, stating that after our army carried out a large-scale encirclement and suppression operation against the bandits led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Xu Xiangqian on the border of Sichuan and Kangding Provinces, they suffered extremely heavy losses. The forces led by Mao Zedong and Peng Dehuai, numbering about 5,000 people and about 4,000 guns, who fled into Shaanxi Province, have joined forces with a force led by Liu Zidan and Xu Haidong in Wuqizhen, Jindingshan, and other places. One force is confronting our army east of Wangjiatai. Another force led by Liu Zidan and Xu Haidong is still near Ganquan. Their main force has fled from Xiasiwan, Wangjiaping, and Longfangzhen to the front and rear Taoyuan. Last month, our Wang Yizhe's army engaged in a fierce battle with Xu Liu's main force near Ganquan. It is true that He Lizhong, the division commander of Wang's army, the chief of staff of the division, and two regimental commanders were killed in action, but the casualties of the bandits were also extremely heavy. As for the main forces led by Zhu De and Xu Xiangqian in northwestern Sichuan, they have now fled to Maogong, Fubian, Suijing, Chonghua, Danba, and other areas. One force has advanced to the east of the Lilong Pass, and another force has attacked Dapaoshan, but was defeated by our unit and fled back to Maoniu. One force has fled to Jinjun, Baoxing, and other places. However, the bandit army is running around in exhaustion, coupled with the lack of materials and manpower, and many people have fallen ill and died along the way due to hunger and cold. Our army's bunkers are tightly layered and layered, and the time for encirclement and annihilation is not far away. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Jinghui Electric Report from Shandong: Expediting the Plugging of the Dongzhuang Breach; Funding of 670,000 Yuan Already Remitted</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dongzhuang breach plugging project requires an estimated 2,670,000+ yuan in funding. The Economic Commission has decided to bear the entire cost and has telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government, urging them to expedite the plugging construction. It is projected that the breach will be closed by April of next year and completed by June. 670,000 yuan of construction funds have already been remitted, with the remaining funds being planned for subsequent allocation. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Economic Commission telegraphed the Provincial Government, stating that the Central Government should be responsible for 2,570,000 yuan of the breach plugging costs. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) If another 1,200,000 yuan is not received before the end of the year for the breach plugging project, then the straw and stone materials will not be delivered in 80% quantity, which will inevitably delay the closing of the breach before the peach blossom flood. Zhang Honglie is determined to fight for it even at the cost of his position. Due to disaster relief efforts, the province needs 300,000 yuan per month, and all resources have been exhausted, making it impossible to take on additional burdens. Han has entrusted Kong Xiangrong to speak favorably on their behalf to the Central Government, urging the prompt allocation of construction funds. Kong is leaving for Beijing tonight, and the construction of the large materials transportation railway will be temporarily postponed. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Significance of the Italy-Abyssinia War in Terms of Racial Relations</h3>
<p>— Enlin</p>
<p>Italy has disregarded everything and launched an attack on Abyssinia. Abyssinia is also resisting with all its national strength. Of course, this is not just a battle of wits between Black Shirt leader Mussolini and Emperor Haile Selassie. This war also encompasses significance in terms of racial and economic relations. The Black scholar W.E.B. Du Bois has written a paper on this racial relationship. The main points can be divided into two: (1) Why Italy is so determined to seize Abyssinia. (2) What lessons can colored people all over the world learn from this event? The original text is roughly as follows: (1)</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, there was no real so-called race problem. Research and discussion about humanity were limited to nationality, culture, and religion. Later, a portion of the prolific ethnic groups sought to develop outwards and needed a group of laborers to serve as tools for their colonial expansion. Thus, the slave trade became a specialized industry. The practice of slave trading became prevalent everywhere, and in the New World of the Americas, various obstacles were encountered. First, people with upright ideas strongly opposed the slave system; second, the development of the democratic movement raised the status of workers. On the surface, the slave trade and slave transport seemed to have come to an end there, but in reality, this was just a trick of the white people, a mere change of the soup without changing the ingredients. As for the European imperialist countries, they turned their African territories into large warehouses, where many slaves were transshipped. By the nineteenth century, white people changed their methods and took wool from the sheep themselves, simply transplanting large numbers of African blacks to develop the African mainland. Under such circumstances, if the cultural and intellectual levels of Europeans and their subject peoples were not far apart, then the race problem would not have arisen. However, in the minds of Europeans, there were differences in status among races, and territorial expansion was necessary and justifiable; and in fact, this gave them enormous profits, making it difficult for everyone to stop. Germany, Belgium, and Italy, seeing that other countries had obtained colonial territories and reaped many benefits, naturally became envious and tried to find ways to enhance their prestige. They indeed felt early on that if they wanted to embark on the path of modern industrialism, they had to do so, or they would face death.</p>
<p>Asia, South America, and Africa were all open to European expansion, but the methods of expansion varied subtly. Asia is the source of culture and can be considered a family of officials and nobles, not allowing European powers to directly dominate through political force. They had to use investment as a precursor to economic invasion. However, before the Great War, Japan was able to escape European domination on its own. South America, sheltered by the Monroe Doctrine, did not suffer interference from European political forces, but the ruling white class there was served by the Indians. Although racial distinctions were not as deeply entrenched as in Asia and Africa, they were still clearly defined. As for Africa and the West Indies, white people only controlled the indigenous laborers, paying them meager wages, and there were no political facilities, education, or industrial training opportunities for them. In short, the goal was to extract the fattest profits from this laboring class.</p>
<p>In addition to engaging in economic development, European people insisted on racial concepts and used the guise of Christianity among the subject natives to carry out their own ulterior motives. This two-pronged approach became a bizarre phenomenon in modern times. For example, Christianity did make some contributions to the cultural construction of Africans and blacks in South America, and it also had some influence on Asia. However, in terms of industrial and economic development, it undoubtedly continuously used Christianity as a smokescreen to make the natives obedient and without revolutionary ambitions. Sometimes the missionaries were used, but they never understood what role they were playing in the play.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>What has been said above mostly refers to the situation before the Great War. After the war, the racial relations of the world underwent a dramatic change, which can be said to be a revolution in racial thought. In addition to escaping the domination of Europeans, Japan emerged as a new force among the world's powers. From then on, white people could no longer arbitrarily rule the world, but had to contend with the colored races who were gradually rising and embarking on the path to freedom. For example, China is currently progressing towards her new order, and once she shakes off the current birth pangs, she will break away from the domination of white people and become an autonomous country, which everyone acknowledges. In addition, countries such as India, Haiti, and Liberia are also gradually breaking free from Eastern bonds and will soon regain their original appearance.</p>
<p>Abyssinia has always been subjected to relatively light restrictions, and its political autonomy has been considerable. It has also begun to change its old policies. In all respects, this black race, which has not been tainted by modern developmentists and racial prejudice, has a promising future. Unfortunately, this beautiful dream was shattered by Italy under the rule of the iron-fisted prime minister. Because she is not an industrial country and still maintains a slave system, Italy regards Abyssinia as an uncivilized barbarian. It should be known that the slave system existing in Abyssinia is completely different from slave trading and the development of territories in modern industrialism. Italy openly advocates depriving these Africans of their land, which is often the first step in cutting off their economic and political support. In fact, Italy's move is imitating its predecessors, England and France.</p>
<p>These countries first established economic power in Africa, and the opening shot was this method. However, in most cases, it was cleverly concealed under the guise of legality. Like Italy, which is now brazenly shouting: For the sake of our tenant farmers, we want the land of Abyssinia, which is truly rare!</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the main reason for the Great War was that several countries wanted to gain a foothold in the development of African territories, and here, another spark was buried. Before the war, Germany had its economic foothold in Asia and Asia Minor, and its future was very promising. However, she was not satisfied with Africa; she regretted the loss of Uganda, because the equal opportunity to develop the upper Nile basin was lost, and she undoubtedly would sooner or later advocate that Belgium abandon the Congo, and was unwilling to allow France to exclusively occupy Lake Chad and the upper Niger basin. Her desire to accomplish these claims was one of the main reasons she welcomed war.</p>
<p>Now everyone seems to be replaying the old tunes. Germany is determined to restore its colonies, and Italy is determined to have Britain and France fulfill the promises given to Italy in the 1915 Treaty of London. Because of this, Germany and Italy were like-minded, and Mussolini and Hitler were as close as glue, twisting together. However, good times do not last, and a sudden change occurred in the middle, because the Germans' attempt to occupy Austria inadvertently broke these plans. The Germans' move startled France and Italy, and they could not help but join hands and become friends. As a result, France no longer opposed Italy's development of East Africa. However, if Italy cuts off a pound of meat from someone by force, who can guarantee that Germany will not reproduce the original version? There are other concerns! The Arabs massacred the Armenians on a large scale because Italy seized Tripoli and Cyrenaica, and they hate them to the bone. Japan's trade volume in the Abyssinian market is not small, and Indians are ubiquitous in East African business. White developers in Africa have always forbidden them from getting involved, but now these Eastern forces have infiltrated, causing a dramatic change in issues such as political sovereignty and people's freedom.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>If Italy, on the one hand, does not hesitate to spend a lot of money and use a large amount of armaments to attack Abyssinia, and on the other hand, still maintains courtesy among European countries, then Italy's victory over Abyssinia may be possible. If this is the case, the price paid by Italy and the white people for this victory will be very high. All colored races—China, India, Japan, Africa, and Africans in America—who have felt oppression and insults, and who have been enslaved and invaded by white people—should think in their hearts: "I told you so! They are untrustworthy, even among their companions. They do not believe in the principles of Christ, and they will never automatically recognize the essential elements of humanity or give up their desire to rule the majority for their own self-interest. Freedom and equality can only be achieved through strength, through great strength."</p>
<p>Let us now ignore the terrible scenes of bloodshed. If we expect that Abyssinia can resist the Italian invasion or remain undefeated after several months, this imagination seems difficult at present, but it is possible. Then what will be the result? The black countries will cheer with eerie music: "The shackles of the Europeans have been broken, this is the beginning of the end, and white people can no longer rely on their violence to make yellow, black, and brown people their slaves." This view is close to fantasy and is too excessive, and the contributions of Europeans and white people to the education of the spiritually-sensitive cannot be dismissed. However, this understanding is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Whether Italy wins or loses this war, it has already pushed the world to a fork in the road, and the envy among races will be even more profound. If Italy loses the war, the prestige of the white world will suffer a serious blow, just like Russia was defeated by Japan.</p>
<p>Now, among the colored races around the world, except for Japan, which is the pride of the race, the others, such as black and brown people, are gradually becoming aware and rising up. The Japanese have also imitated the ways of European white people, using military power and commercial economic power to expand outwards. At this time, Italy, disregarding everything, gives people a terrible impression. Although she is the center of Catholicism and the home of modern cultural and artistic revival, she frankly says: We want to conquer an inferior nation, not for their sake, but for our own benefit. We are going to take Abyssinia, just like we took Somaliland and Britain took Nyasaland. We want to turn black people into landless slaves. Because we have the power to do this, and no white country dares to, and no colored country can, stop us. Therefore, from the black people's point of view, under this argument, if colored countries want to maintain themselves, it is useless to hope for anything from white Europe or to appeal to religion and culture. The only way out is strength. Small and weak countries and colored races around the world can only endure and wait for the outcome of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute. Why can't the world, or any part of the world, stop this great disturbance? What we can understand is that the actions of the other countries are no different from Italy's!</p>

<h3>The Bank of China Reorganized into a Reserve Bank; Extreme Support from All Quarters</h3>
<p>Reorganization Procedures Can Be Easily Realized in a Short Time; Deliberate Inclusion of Private Shares; Oversight of Government Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi declared that the reorganization of the Central Bank into a Central Reserve Bank, to become a detached organization able to fully maintain the stability of the national currency, has been met with extreme support from all quarters. According to Kong, the existing Central Bank is already, in practice, acting as a bank among banks. Reorganization into the Central Reserve Bank is an easy process and can be achieved in the shortest time possible. To ensure that the people understand the actual reserve situation of the legal tender, Kong also plans to sell a proportion of the Central Reserve Bank's shares to the people, so that they can be elected as directors and supervisors of the bank in their capacity as shareholders, allowing them to oversee the government's measures regarding the new monetary policy. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A well-known monetary economist stated that, according to Song Ziwen's assurances, the reserve amount for banknotes currently circulating on the market already exceeds 10% of the amount issued. In other words, every 100 yuan banknote has 110 yuan in reserve, an unprecedentedly ample reserve. The Chinese people have always trusted the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Now that they have been reorganized into legal tender and have ample reserves, trust should be even more solid than before, and the success of the new monetary policy can be predicted. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong today told Reuters reporters his confidence that China's new currency system is bound to succeed. It is said that this new approach stabilizes the currency, restores credit, revives trade, and reverses the recession. Stability of the currency is essential. Now, the Finance Ministry's struggle against monetary instability has achieved a great victory. Reports from all over the country have indicated that the public understands and supports the Finance Ministry's policies. Friendly nations and their banks are also giving close cooperation, for which we are deeply grateful, and hope that they will continue to cooperate with the Chinese people to usher in a new era beneficial to industry and commerce, so that the Chinese and foreign people can all benefit from it.

<h3>Uniform Implementation of the New Currency System in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance Also Issues Announcement of Compliance, Along with Six Measures</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance issued an announcement on the 6th to comply with the Ministry of Finance's new monetary laws, laying down six measures: 1. From November 7th onwards, all public and private receipts and payments shall be limited to legal tender. Cash may not be used, nor may it be privately hoarded. 2. The management and issuance of legal tender reserves shall be handled by a management committee jointly formed by the government and the people. 3. From the 7th, people shall exchange their existing silver for silver yuan notes at the government custodial association, with an added value of 2 jiao for small silver coins and 4 jiao for large silver coins. 4. All silver shall be sold to the provincial bank from the 7th onwards and may not be privately hoarded. 5. Contracts previously made in silver coins shall be settled in legal tender uniformly. 6. People may freely buy and sell foreign currencies they originally possess, but they may not be directly used. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping city government has been ordered to use legal tender to redeem silver and banknotes from various commercial banks, so that legal tender is used uniformly on the market. After the banking association decided on the steps, each bank has separately compiled a clear statistic of its silver reserves and the amount of banknotes issued, which has been reported to the association. The association believes that the existing legal tender, Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, in Beiping city are not sufficient for its own use. Therefore, the association telegraphed Shanghai requesting a large batch of legal tender to be sent to Beiping quickly, so that the second step of the redemption work can be carried out. It is also heard that after the collection of all silver in the city, it is planned to transport it to the Central Government for preservation, so Beiping does not plan to set up a separate custodial institution. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Banking Association and the Money Trade Association held another joint meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the investigation of the amount of silver reserves in various banks in the city and requested the Ministry of Finance to establish a custodial association in Tianjin. The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to Tianjin on the 5th, inquiring about the amount of silver reserves in Tianjin and urging a prompt report. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Banking and Money Trade Associations decided to seal up 7.8 million yuan of silver in various banks in Tianjin and plan to telegraph the Ministry of Finance requesting a temporary suspension of shipment to Shanghai as a reserve for the future Tianjin Custodial Committee. On the 6th, various commodity prices fell slightly, and the market situation was more stable. Merchants and the public believe that the Central Government's unified legal tender system is a perfect method and are enthusiastically promoting it. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since receiving the notice from the Central Bank's Hankou branch, banks in Hankou have reported in detail the amount of silver in stock and the number of banknotes issued as of November 3rd from the 6th. Foreign banks in Hankou, such as Citibank and HSBC, are able to implement the measures stipulated by the Central Government. It is heard that the number of hard coins in Hankou is about 10 million yuan. The Central Bank's Hankou branch has received several million yuan in legal tender from the head office on the 6th, which can be exchanged as much as possible at any time. For deposits in various Nanye banks, legal tender will be provided to assist in case of withdrawals and crowding. Although some foreign firms have taken a wait-and-see attitude in purchasing goods in recent days, this pause will only last for a few days. The rise in commodity prices on the market and the lack of copper coins are due to merchants and the public not understanding the situation. It is expected that it will not be difficult to calm down within a few days. The market in various places in the province, such as Yichang and Shashi, is also extremely stable. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Central Bank's Hankou branch notified various banks on the 5th to investigate and report the types and amounts of banknotes in stock and the amount of cash. Foreign Citibank and HSBC also changed to legal tender. However, it is difficult for unscrupulous merchants to exchange copper coins for small-scale trade, and suppression is being planned. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After the improvement of the currency system, the Wuhan market is still stable, but commodity prices are soaring. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has strictly ordered the crackdown on hoarding and speculation and has convened the chairman of the Wuyang Chamber of Commerce to discuss stabilizing commodity prices in order to maintain finance. The Hankou authorities will also take strict measures. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Since the Ministry of Finance issued the order to reform the currency system, the price of silver dollars in the city has skyrocketed. Every 100 yuan can be exchanged for 140 to 150 yuan of paper currency. Petty merchants are secretly buying them, and the prices of various commodities have also skyrocketed. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) The county chamber of commerce convened a joint meeting of various industries at 4:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the implementation of a unified currency system. Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Ma Lingfu attended the meeting to provide instructions.

<p>(Jinan) Today, the Central Bank convened a meeting of all banks and money houses in the city at the Banking Association, reported on the currency reform order, and ordered each bank to report the number of silver and banknote reserves held by itself and on behalf of others as of the 3rd of this month to the bank tonight in order to report it to the head office. The city's silver reserves are about 7 million yuan. Since the Department of Finance prohibited all banks from exchanging cash two months ago, the market is not affected. However, commodity prices are soaring, and finance is still tight. The Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to go to the Department of Finance on the 7th to request that the banks handle mortgage loans to activate the market, because local products are now on the market. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Provincial Government has issued a circular to all counties stating that all receipts and payments should be made in legal tender. The city's economy is exhausted, and there is no circulation function. Silver is still extremely tight. After the various money shops were dismantled from the Central Yumin, the transaction that had fallen into stagnation was restored. However, there are still very few deposits and withdrawals. The prices of various commodities have risen. The dockworkers' union appealed to the general labor union to suppress commodity prices in order to maintain their livelihood. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The number of people exchanging cash for legal tender at the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications has been quite enthusiastic in recent days, about 200,000. However, unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise the market prices of goods. The price of rice in each stall has risen by 4 jiao uniformly from today. The city chamber of commerce has specially convened a joint meeting of various industry associations to discuss suppressing commodity prices. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Since the Central Government announced the legal tender decree, all merchants in Zhenjiang have complied, and the market is stable. However, the exchange industry has almost invisibly closed due to the lack of market prices. Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department of Finance, specially convened the leaders of the Zhenjiang silver and money industries at noon on the 6th to discuss the issue of copper coin exchange rates. The Department of Finance stipulated that each banknote should be exchanged for 1 jiao and 2 jiao of small silver coins and 3,000 wen of copper coins, which has been submitted to the Provincial Government for review and to the Ministry of Finance for record. Once approved, it will be announced in about seven days to reassure merchants and the public and stabilize the market and will be notified to all counties for uniform compliance. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) Since the promulgation of the nationalization of hard coins, the price of small silver coins has skyrocketed. On this day, the auxiliary coins of the Republic of China in the second and third years, transported from Hong Kong, and the silver coins cast by the province's officials, were 1 yuan of foreign currency for every ten haos of small foreign currency. Various money shops in the city are still secretly buying and selling silver, which is mostly handed over to Taiwanese to transport to Taiwan and then to Japan, which can earn a 3 jiao profit. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) stopped paying hard coins on the 6th and issued approximately 100,000 yuan in new one-yuan banknotes. It is widely rumored in financial circles that the Hong Kong government will take the same steps as our government to implement currency management policies. Speculators are extremely active and are buying silver, causing the discount on every thousand silver dollars to be 90 yuan. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was one shilling and six and a half pence when the Agricultural Bank opened today, a decrease of half a pence compared to the 5th. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong government officially endorsed the Central Government's currency reform measures today and issued a circular tonight, prohibiting the use of silver as currency from tomorrow. The current silver situation requires the government to adopt a plan for currency control. Therefore, in addition to prohibiting the use of silver as currency, the people are not allowed to hoard silver dollars or large silver bars. Violators will be punished according to law. It is also stated that the government will never adopt a currency inflation method, and the issuance of national currency will be supervised by a preparatory committee jointly organized by the people and the government. The circular does not mention the stability measures for the exchange of Guangdong currency with foreign currencies, but the circular allows the public to continue to buy and sell Hong Kong dollars in order to facilitate foreign exchange, but Hong Kong dollars must not be directly circulated in domestic transactions. In the past two days, the price of Hong Kong dollars has skyrocketed, as the public believes that the government will eventually endorse the Central Government's currency reform measures. The premium on Hong Kong dollars reached a record high of 5 jiao 2 fen 2 today. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peking City Government Strictly Prohibits Price Gouging and Orders Military Police to Protect All Banks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Peking City Government received a telegram from Chairman Chiang stating that the Ministry of Finance has announced that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will manage currency circulation with legal tender. This concerns the rectification of the currency system, the activation of finance, the relief of industry and commerce, and the stabilization of public sentiment. It is imperative to assist in the implementation of this measure to ensure its widespread adoption. However, at the beginning of the announcement, there is deep concern that the general public may not understand the true situation, leading to misunderstandings, which would allow unscrupulous elements to take the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt public order. It is requested that subordinates be instructed to protect banks in all localities and to carefully explain the situation to the public so that they understand the truth. The City Government has replied that, as Peking is the capital of the country, all eyes are on it, and price gouging must be stopped to ensure stability. It has already sent letters to the military police, party headquarters, chambers of commerce, and guilds of money dealers to discuss methods of prevention. At the same time, in conjunction with the military police agencies, it issued a public notice. In addition to sending letters to the military police agencies to protect the banks properly, it also instructed subordinates to pay attention to the soaring prices of commodities in the market at all times and to find ways to stop it.

<h3>Mayor of Peiping, Yuan Liang, Approved to Resign</h3>
<p>—Vacancy Temporarily Filled by Song Zheyuan—</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Yuan Liang, the mayor of Peiping, has been in office here and has made considerable achievements in local construction. The most notable of these is that most of the main roads in the city have been paved with asphalt. The reorganization of cultural relics of the old capital has also been effective. As for the supervision of water and electricity utilities, both companies have been able to comply with orders. In the field of education, he trained and selected teachers and increased the number of schools. Unexpectedly, a bolt from the blue struck, and he was subject to extraordinary constraints. Therefore, on November 1, he submitted a request to the Central Government to resign from his post. On the 3rd, he received a reply from the Executive Yuan approving his request. Yuan immediately summoned the principals of various schools that evening to say goodbye. They were silent and speechless. Yuan said with emotion that the responsibility of those who run education is greater than those who run politics, and the methods of those who run politics are more difficult than those who run education. Therefore, I hope that you will continue to work hard in education with the spirit of enjoying it. As for my running politics, looking back, I cannot say that I have no perseverance, but I still cannot break through or resist the difficulties. How painful it is! Many of those present wept when they heard this. Finally, they said goodbye to each other. On the 4th, Yuan had already left Peiping by car to go south.</p>
<p>The Peiping Municipal Government's administrative plan for the 24th year is to complete the first step of the construction of the scenic area. As of now, one-third of the first step has been completed. Yuan's plan was to make visitors enjoy themselves so much that they would forget to return, and to thoroughly understand the long history of Chinese culture and its great spirit. He never expected that this plan would encounter unexpected setbacks just as it was beginning. The unfinished work will rely on the successor to complete. Song Zheyuan, who was ordered to temporarily take over as mayor, took office on the morning of the 5th. In his speech to the staff after taking office, Song also said that he would like to continue to work on Yuan's plan and declared that he hoped that you would continue to work hard with the spirit of service you had when Mayor Yuan was in office. Therefore, it is expected that Yuan's unfinished work will not be interrupted. However, Chen Baoshu, the secretary-general of the Municipal Government, and others resigned and have been approved by Yuan before his departure. Cai Yuan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others also requested to resign to Song in person, and Song earnestly tried to persuade them to stay. (5th)</p>
<h3>More Than 50 Organizations in Guangzhou Welcome Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>2,000 People from All Walks of Life Arrived at the Station to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Commanders Chen and Li Both Hosted Banquets to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu, a member of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and a leader in sports among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, personally led the Malaysian Chinese athletes to attend the National Games and was warmly welcomed by people from all over the country. On the 1st, he arrived in Hong Kong by boat. Hu took the opportunity to return to the country and made a special trip to Guangdong to visit and inspect the construction of the province. When the local authorities here heard the news, they sent representatives to Hong Kong to welcome Hu. Yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, Hu, along with the welcoming representatives and accompanying secretaries Ye Guisong, You Fanwu, and Hu Cimei, arrived in the province on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express. The details of their arrival in the port are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrival at Port</p>
<p>The express train that Hu was on departed from Hong Kong at 8:00 a.m. and arrived at the Da Shatou Station at 11:25 a.m. In advance, a platoon of 15 military police was dispatched, and the Qianjian Branch dispatched police officers to protect the station. The people who arrived at the station to welcome him included Wen Taihua, representing Commander Chen, Chen Guoliang, representing Commander Li, Lin Yizhong, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Huang Linshu, Director of the Department of Education, Hu Weiwan, President of the Aviation School, Shen Yangong, representing the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, Zeng Xiaofeng and Shao Zongmeng, Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Hu Shuxin, representing the Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce and the Guangdong Provincial Hu Clan Association, representatives from the Guangdong Renai Benevolent Hall, the Sacred Spirit Orphanage, the Holy Infant Nursery, the Jianzhong Middle School, the Huadi Orphanage, the National University, Lingnan University, and various overseas Chinese charitable organizations, and about 2,000 people from all walks of life. They were all lined up on the platform of the Da Shatou Station. After the train arrived, Hu stepped out of the carriage, music played loudly, and the welcoming personnel boarded the train one after another to shake hands with Hu as a courtesy. Then, they filed out of the station, changed to cars, and toured along Baiyun Road, Changdi, Taiping Road, and Yonghan Road, and arrived at the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee on Dadong Road. There were more than 100 cars to welcome him at the station. Firecrackers were set off along the way, and the scene was extremely lively.</p>
<p>Welcome Reception</p>
<p>The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Provincial Council Hall on Dadong Road to welcome Hu as a giant among overseas Chinese. All the members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee were present, as well as representatives from the Joint Office of the British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia, the American Alliance Association, the China National Federation of Machine Workers, the Overseas Comrades Society, the Overseas Chinese Industrial Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Headquarters, the Renai Benevolent Hall, the Army General Hospital, Zhongshan University, Lingnan University, and more than 50 other organizations, as well as all the boy scouts of the National University and Jianzhong Middle School, the Orphan Education Institute, and all the staff and students of the Holy Infant Nursery. During the meeting, Lin Yizhong delivered a welcoming speech, briefly inviting Mr. Hu to come to Guangdong this time. The association is holding a meeting here to welcome him and hopes that Mr. Hu will strongly support the charitable undertakings, industry, culture, and construction of this province. Then, Hu gave a reply, saying that he had two purposes for returning to the country this time: (1) to lead the Malaysian Chinese athletes to Shanghai to participate in the National Games; (2) to visit various construction projects in the motherland and inspect the industries of various provinces, in preparation for future investment. I am very honored to be invited by you today. The speakers included Wen Taihua, representing the General Headquarters, Huang Linshu, Director of the Department of Education, and representatives from the Overseas Comrades Society and the Overseas Chinese Industrial Federation of Southeast Asia, who highly praised Hu's various undertakings. At about 1:00 p.m., the meeting ended happily, and they went to the New Asia Hotel to rest. At 2:30 p.m., he attended a banquet hosted by Chairman Lin of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee at the Taiping Restaurant, and then went to the Hu Clan Ancestral Hall for a welcome meeting, and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of the Hu Clan Memorial Hall. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Commander Chen at Meihua Village, where they had a very pleasant conversation. The next day, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National University held a welcome banquet. On the third day, he returned to Hong Kong by car.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Two Thieves Who Hid Jewelry Captured</p>
<p>The 14th Security Brigade, while protecting the highway the day before yesterday, discovered that one of the passengers in Minhang was hiding gunpowder, which violated the prohibition. They also found a lot of jewelry, gold, and silverware hidden in the legs of his trousers. Recognizing that he was not a good person, they detained him together with another passenger who looked flustered. They found more pieces of gold and silver jewelry. After interrogating them, they confessed that they had robbed the home of an unknown person outside the South Gate of Songjiang County and the home of Xi Genfa in Yexie. There was also a small boat moored in the Xiaonei River in Minhang. They were taken there for a search, and four more accomplices were captured. After questioning, they confessed their names: Wang Asan, Chen Ada, Zhu Aer, Xu Dezhong, Zhou Aer, and Wang Ada. After hearing the news, the County Public Security Bureau sent Detective Sun Shaoqing to Minhang with the victim Xi Genfa to identify them. The people and the stolen goods were correct. They returned to Songjiang and reported, and will send a document to Minhang to transfer them to Songjiang for trial.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Hongtai Money Shop Suddenly Closes</p>
<p>The Hongtai Money Shop in the Dongzhong Market of Banmennei, which was a Shouzih-grade shop, had been open for five years. It was jointly opened by the Xi Honggao Opera Costume Shop. The manager was Bian Rongsen from Zhenjiang, and the assistant manager was Chen Jieliang. Because the assistant manager embezzled money, they all ran away at about 4:00 a.m. on the 6th, along with more than ten employees. The manager also disappeared at the same time. Bian's family had moved to Suzhou and left Suzhou a week earlier. The shop's cash ledger and employee guarantee were also taken away. The preparations were extremely thorough in advance. After hearing the news, the Money Dealers' Guild held an emergency meeting in the afternoon. It is reported that more than 100,000 yuan was embezzled. Because the dealings with other money shops were not large, the bad debts were not large.</p>
<p>The Son Murder Case Proved to Be Suicide by Hanging</p>
<p>Zao Wang, the son of Wu Jiangshi, who lived on Guimen Street outside Banmen, suddenly died. There were rumors that he was strangled to death by his mother. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the local prosecutor's office sent personnel to conduct a detailed examination on the afternoon of the 5th. The conclusion was that he had indeed committed suicide by hanging himself. When the examination was conducted, there were one or two thousand spectators. Only after the examination was confirmed was the truth revealed.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Copper Coins Plunge, Shaking the Market</p>
<p>In Wuxi, the market price of copper coins in the past month was as high as 3,500 wen per yuan due to the large number of coins being released. At the beginning of this month, the price gradually fell back to 3,260 wen due to the gradual increase in sales. Unexpectedly, after the Ministry of Finance announced its policy of reforming the currency system, a certain yarn factory took advantage of the opportunity to purchase cotton clothes at the place of production and collected a large number of copper coins. Various tobacco shops took the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing a sudden shortage of copper coins in the market and a plunge in the exchange rate to 1,000 wen. On the morning of the 5th, the Money Dealers' Guild also stated that there was a great demand for copper coins from all parties, but very few were released, so they made an opening price, which fell to 2,700 wen. In the afternoon, the market was even more short of copper coins. The tobacco shops were manipulating the market again, and it was even impossible to exchange them anywhere. The market was extremely chaotic. The Chamber of Commerce also received long-distance telephone calls from the chambers of commerce of Wujin and Suzhou, inquiring about the market situation and reporting that the market price in Suzhou and Changzhou was still 3,050 wen per yuan. On the morning of the 6th, the Money Dealers' Guild saw that there was very little source of copper coins and that the demand was still strong, so they made an opening price, which fell sharply to 1,400 wen for purchase and 2,400 wen for sale. Within three days, the exchange rate per yuan differed by as much as 8 or 900 wen, which was unprecedented in previous years. Compared with Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the difference was also significant. It was clearly a deliberate attempt to raise prices and monopolize the market. On the 6th, a special telegram was sent to the Central Government, requesting the county to investigate the matter thoroughly in order to stabilize the market and prevent disruption.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Red Pill Manufacturer Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Xu Jinshan from Jiangxi used to run a paper-making business in Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province. From 1925 to 1926, he secretly set up a red pill manufacturing plant in the county and sold them widely in Qu County, Suichang, Chun'an and other counties, accumulating huge wealth. Someone secretly reported him to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to search and found more than a dozen bags of red pills, weighing more than 170 taels, and arrested Miao Zunzhou, the red pill manufacturing technician, and Chen Sanshou and other accomplices. Unexpectedly, the criminal was very capable and colluded with Yang Chun, a member of the county party headquarters, and Miao Maolian, a patrol officer, who actually allowed him to be released on bail. The case was referred to the province, and Xu Jinshan, Chen Sanshou, and Miao Zunzhou were sentenced to death. Wu Bingwang, Yang Chun, Miao Maolian, and others were sentenced to imprisonment. At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, the Security Department escorted the two criminals Xu and Chen to the Zhakou execution ground and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Chief Justice of Jiangsu High Court Visits Yangzhou for Inspection</p>
<p>Zhu Shusheng, the Chief Justice of the Jiangsu High Court, believes that the judiciary of the counties north of the Yangtze River urgently needs to be thoroughly reformed. Although he usually receives written reports from local courts, he wants to seek reform, but he has no way to start because he doesn't know the real situation. He has visited Xuzhou and Huai'an. After completing the inspection in Huaiyin, he went south on the Qingjia wheel with Shi, a clerk from the High Court. He arrived in Yangzhou on the evening of the 4th and stayed at the Dalu Hotel on Xinsheng Street. On the morning of the 5th, he went to Yizheng County for inspection. In the afternoon, he returned to Yangzhou and then went to the Jiangdu District Court for a week of inspection. He inquired in detail about the judicial situation in the county. Then, Luo Zhikao, the president of the Jiangdu Court, Li Weishan, the chief prosecutor, and Zou Shumin, the clerk, accompanied Judge Zhu to visit the detention center. Zhu first read through the various prisoner registers, and then went to the prison to inspect separately, giving many instructions on the hygiene and reform of the prisoners.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Regulations on Legal Tender and the Real Situation of Financial Stability in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Issuing Reserve Committee Investigates the Reserves of Various Banks Yesterday and Designates a Treasury to Store Legal Tender Reserves. Various Countries Issue Announcements Endorsing Legal Tender.</p>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement that the notes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender, the financial situation in Shanghai has tended towards stability. The Issuing Reserve Committee investigated the issuing reserves of various banks yesterday. The Municipal Joint Association issued an announcement endorsing the legal tender. Silver firms and money shops are setting "Hui Tou" and "Hua Tou" exchange rates. The secretly marked notes of the three banks have ceased to be reissued and are being gradually withdrawn. The Central Mint is preparing to mint subsidiary currency. The China Industrial Association held a meeting yesterday to increase production. Detailed information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Legal Tender Reserves - Designated Treasury</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, the rules of procedure have been drafted by Xu Kan and others and are nearing completion. After the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, returns to Shanghai, a second meeting will be held to pass them. As for the legal tender reserves, the committee has designated the treasuries of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as reserve treasuries. However, the silver dollar ingots, etc., minted by the Central Mint, after being examined and approved, will be stored in the factory, completing the Ministry of Finance's great treasury, and will not be used as legal tender issuing reserves.</p>
<p>Investigating the Issuing Reserves of Various Banks</p>
<p>In addition to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, whose banknotes have been announced by the Ministry of Finance as legal tender, there are still ten other banks issuing banknotes (i.e., Zhongnan), China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Commercial Bank, Reclamation Bank, Agricultural and Commercial Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, China Agricultural Cooperative Bank, and Zhejiang Local Bank. However, the head office of Zhejiang Local Bank is in Hangzhou, and the head office of China Farmers' Bank is in Hankou. Yesterday, the Issuing Reserve Management Committee sent Committee Member Ye Zhuotang to Zhejiang Industrial Bank and others to investigate the issuing reserves. It is reported that he will continue to investigate China Industrial Bank and others today.</p>
<p>Bank's Secretly Marked Notes Have Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>After the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were designated as legal tender, market demand increased sharply. Taking Shanghai as an example, the three banks issued approximately six million yuan in banknotes on the fourth day and approximately ten million yuan in banknotes on the fifth day. As for the secretly marked notes previously issued by the three banks to adjust the financial situation, they were issued to various money shops and banks with preferential measures. Since the fourth day, they have been gradually withdrawn and have ceased to be reissued. However, small banks and small money shops that rely on secretly marked notes as an important part of their business will be affected and will have to change their business policies.</p>
<p>Separate Research on "Hui Tou" and "Hua Tou" Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, manager of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, and Qin Xiqing, manager of the Money Shop Joint Reserve, have conducted separate research. After drafting detailed measures, they will schedule a meeting with the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to determine the rates. The negotiable instruments circulating in the Shanghai silver and money industry are divided into "Hui Tou" and "Hua Tou". "Hui Tou" refers to the money that money shops exchange between each other, which can be offset against each other at the "Hui Hua Zong Hui" on the same night. "Hua Tou" refers to the silver that money shops exchange with Chinese and foreign banks, which must be delivered in cash on the same day. In other words, "Hui Tou" refers to next-day transactions, while "Hua Tou" refers to same-day transactions.</p>
<p>Bank of China Announces Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China announced foreign exchange rates yesterday morning: one British pound was equal to one shilling and two and a half pence, twenty-nine yuan and seventy-five cents for New York, four hundred and fifty francs for Paris, seventy-three and a half marks for Berlin, one hundred and three yuan for Japan, and seventy-nine yuan for Hong Kong. The above rates are per one hundred yuan of foreign currency, equivalent to one thousand one hundred and forty-nine yuan of Shanghai tael silver. One Customs Gold Unit is equivalent to two yuan, two jiao, seven fen, and one li of national currency, equivalent to thirty-two pence and nine three seven five of British gold, and sixty-seven cents and six two five of American gold. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced the equalization tax rate at 10:00 yesterday morning as 57.25%, a decrease of 1.25% from the previous day.</p>
<p>Municipal Joint Association Announces Support Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Joint Association issued a special notice to its members yesterday in support of the currency system policy, stating: "This notice concerns the six major points of the currency policy announced by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on the fourth of this month. Its main purpose is to seek financial stability and achieve the revival of the national economy, enriching the country and benefiting the people. It is truly admirable. All measures are well-considered. All citizens, for the sake of the country and for their own sake, should express their support and jointly enter the path of prosperity. Therefore, we hereby notify all members to widely publicize and ensure that all citizens know the beauty and goodness of the policy, rise up together to support it, and diligently implement it. This is not only the duty of our citizens, but also a good sign for the future of the country. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>National Goods Industry Association's Telegram of Support</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, supporting the legal tender: "To Minister Kong, Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: We have previously submitted a document requesting the abandonment of the silver standard and the reform of the currency system to prevent the outflow of silver and to relieve the plight of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and have sent representatives to Beijing to petition. We are grateful for your humble inquiries. We have long known that you are determined to implement the great plan to save the country. Now, we have received the emergency decree promulgated on November 4, stipulating that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender and cannot be redeemed for cash, and that violators will have their assets confiscated in full. From now on, we will use legal tender to relieve agriculture and industry, compile international exchange rates, strictly manage the issuance, and strive to realize the great plan of revival as soon as possible. Friendly nations are assisting us, and Chinese and foreigners alike admire your plans. Our association will lead all members and factories to express our sincerity and respectfully submit our sentiments. We sincerely hope that you will take note of this. Lu Xingzhuang, Chairman of the Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association; Zhang Zilian, Ma Jisheng, Tu Kaizheng, and other standing committee members; and all members kowtow." (Seal)</p>
<p>Industrial Meeting Discusses Steps</p>
<p>The China Industrial Association convened a temporary membership meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss financial issues. Representatives from the Meilin Company, Ya Pu Er Electric Appliance Factory, Great China Rubber Factory, Fuxin Flour Mill, Commercial Press, Dachen Yarn Factory, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, Wing On Yarn Factory, China Cement Company, Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Tianli Gas Factory, and others attended. Guo Shun chaired the meeting (Qian Chengxu substituted). As a result of the discussions, the following steps that the production sector should take after the currency system reform were agreed upon in principle: (A) purchase of raw materials, (B) financial transactions, (C) contract orders, and (D) price stability. After detailed study by each member, the opinions will be submitted to the general secretary within three days to compile a catalog, which will be explained in detail and submitted to the Economic Struggle Committee for research. Representatives from the Qingdao, Jinan, Suzhou, and Changzhou branches will then convene a regular meeting to discuss implementation. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Announces Strict Prohibition of Intentionally Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Excessive Price Increases Beyond Cost Will Be Deemed as Violations of Orders. Four Measures Are Stipulated, and the Chamber of Commerce Is Instructed to Advise.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's promulgation of legal tender this time was originally a major plan for economic recovery and financial stability. However, some unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to manipulate and hoard goods, causing various prices to rise sharply, especially rice, which is related to the people's food. Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, under the order of the Municipal Government, issued a notice this morning stipulating four measures, and violators will be severely punished. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instructed to advise. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Notice: The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Notice states: "The currency policy promulgated by the Ministry of Finance this time is a crucial plan for economic recovery, financial stability, and national welfare. We have repeatedly and clearly prohibited any attempts to speculate and raise prices. However, in the past two days, prices in this city have soared, which is obviously due to the manipulation and hoarding by a small number of merchants, which is extremely illegal. In addition to instructing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to order all trade associations to submit fair price lists for review, anyone who intentionally raises prices will be dealt with according to the law. In addition to reporting and issuing separate orders, the measures for dealing with price increases are hereby announced to the public. This notice."</p>
<p>Stipulated Measures: Four attached measures: (1) Each trade association should, within three days, negotiate prices based on the amount of cost. If the negotiated prices exceed the cost too much and there is suspicion of intentionally raising prices, it will be deemed as resisting central government orders, and all executive committee members of the trade association will be held responsible. (2) Each trade association may notify all members to comply with the negotiated prices in advance and submit the negotiated price list and verification standards to the bureau for record at the same time. (3) Regardless of whether each trade association has industry regulations or whether the industry regulations have been approved, the negotiated price list must be compulsorily observed by all members, whether they are exclusively or concurrently operating, and whether they are members or non-members. (4) Those who violate the negotiated prices and arbitrarily lower prices may still be dealt with in accordance with the approved industry regulations.</p>
<p>Instructing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Government's instruction No. 16162 states: "The currency policy promulgated by the Ministry of Finance this time is a crucial plan for economic recovery and financial stability. We have repeatedly and clearly prohibited any attempts to speculate and raise prices. However, in the past two days, prices in this city have soared. For example, the price of rice has risen by as much as one or two yuan, which is obviously due to the manipulation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. If they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to deter evil and maintain local peace. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to promptly and effectively crack down on this and arrest unscrupulous merchants who violate orders for investigation and prosecution according to the law, we hereby instruct you to earnestly comply and promptly report the compliance situation." Upon receiving this instruction, the bureau found that a small number of merchants were manipulating prices and intentionally raising them, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, the bureau instructed the chamber to comply and order all trade associations to negotiate balanced prices based on the amount of cost within three days of receiving this document, and to notify all trades to comply compulsorily, regardless of whether they are exclusively or concurrently operating, and whether they are members or non-members. The price list and verification standards should be submitted to the bureau for record. If the price list is found to exceed the cost excessively and there is suspicion of intentionally raising prices, it will be deemed as resisting central government orders and will be severely punished. All executive committee members of the trade association will be held fully responsible. Those who do not comply with the prices negotiated by the trade association and intentionally raise prices will be punished in accordance with central government orders. Those who violate the price list approved by the bureau and arbitrarily lower prices may still be dealt with in accordance with the promulgated industry regulations. In addition to reporting and announcing, you are hereby ordered to comply and report the compliance situation for record without delay. This order.</p>
<p>Mint to Mint Subsidiary Currency</p>
<p>After the Money Trade Association received instructions to regulate the price of subsidiary currency, with small silver dollars set at 1.2 jiao per legal tender yuan and copper coins set at 300 coins per legal tender yuan, the market price in the money trade market has been set at 833.3 yuan per jiao and 300,000 per copper coin. It is reported that the Central Mint will also mint nickel subsidiary currency in four denominations: 5 li, 1 jiao, 1.5 jiao, and 2.5 jiao, to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>Nationalization of Silver Has Shown Practical Results</p>
<p>After the six measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all silver should be nationalized, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee, in order to actively prevent the outflow of silver, has been increasing the export equalization tax rate on silver daily since the fourth day. The tax rate announced the day before yesterday was 58.5%, reaching the highest level. This morning, Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen, members of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, jointly discussed and determined the equalization tax rate to be 57.25%, restoring the same tax rate as on the fourth day, which is still 50.5% higher than the 6.75% of the previous month. Judging from the situation, the nationalization of silver has shown practical results.</p>
<p>Mortgage of Real Estate Will Be Realized</p>
<p>Regarding the mortgage of real estate, in addition to stipulating that the Central Bank will be the reserve bank and will no longer engage in ordinary commercial banking business, the promulgated decree specifically allows the establishment of real estate mortgage banks to invigorate real estate and alleviate the stagnant state of the real estate economy in the past. The declining real estate industry in the city is reportedly delighted by this news and will proceed to discuss the realization of real estate mortgages. However, all parties believe that this should be handled prudently to avoid affecting the gradually stabilizing financial situation.</p>
<p>Unity of the Industry and Unified Market Prices</p>
<p>During this autumn of industrial and commercial decline, most industries are engaging in large-scale dumping due to market depression in order to sell off goods. If this continues, they will all perish. However, since the implementation of the new currency system, each industry, in order to seek the development of its own interests, deeply knows that it will not succeed without the unity of the industry and unified market prices. Therefore, in recent days, various industry associations have held meetings one after another to discuss various issues such as unified market prices and the cessation of dumping. This is truly the only good sign for the future of China's industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Confirmed Silver Deposits of Chinese and Foreign Banks</p>
<p>In the past three years, the confirmed silver deposits of various Chinese and foreign banks in the city are listed in the table below. The deposits of Chinese banks have increased from over 200 million to nearly 300 million, while the deposits of foreign banks have decreased from over 200 million to over 30 million. The difference in increase and decrease is almost tenfold. The details are specifically recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Year 22  Year 23  Year 24</p>
<p>January 265,185  284,585  294,983</p>
<p>February 281,973  287,819  289,657</p>

<p>Mr. Zheng Hongnian Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>During the 19th year of the Republic of China, the United States, due to the excessively low price of silver, intended to lend us 100 million ounces of silver. If we had accepted it at that time and used it as a foundation, and further contracted with silver-producing countries to purchase it, making China the world's silver market, the financial panic in the past two years would not have occurred. In October of last year, the government ordered the collection of silver export tax and equalization tax, but the remedy for the outflow was very small. Now, the financial authorities have resolutely implemented a unified currency system policy to prevent the outflow of silver. This is the only pivot for the economic recovery of our country. This move is most suitable for the current situation in our country, but the implementation method must realistically take into account all aspects. According to my personal opinion: (1) The government should realistically make it clear to the national populace that this policy is not currency inflation. Most importantly, it must be made clear to the remote villages and hamlets. This must be the responsibility of the village chiefs of each district to explain it. Although the people do not have large amounts of silver to hoard, some of them certainly do. Therefore, it must be explained to avoid future disturbances by unscrupulous elements under this pretext. (2) I agree with the participation of financial leaders in the organization of the Reserve Management Committee, but financial leaders sometimes cannot but focus on their own interests. Therefore, other leaders from all walks of life must participate at the same time, such as leaders from free professions such as lawyers, accountants, economic experts, and the education sector. Also, reserve sub-treasuries should be established in various places where banks are located, so that the public can know about them nearby, and leaders of this kind must also participate. In addition, there are two other points: (A) A review committee must be organized, and the selection of personnel should be as above. They must conduct a strict review once a week and make it public. This is because the level of the Chinese people is uneven, and the method of credit investigation must be particularly truthful. (B) In addition to cash and securities, real estate can also be included in the reserve treasury, but a uniform composition must be stipulated. I believe that real estate prices will definitely rise to avoid future impact. (3) Controlling international trade, it is very right for the government to unconditionally purchase and sell foreign exchange in order to stabilize the exchange rate of the national currency, but merchants often inevitably take this opportunity to speculate. The government should also control international trade at the same time, and the government should purchase needed goods in bulk and sell them to merchants. (4) Controlling copper coins, the living standard of the Chinese people is too low (there are still people living on more than one yuan per month). Copper coins cannot be abolished, but there should be a realistic statistic on the demand for copper coins in various places, and we must pray that the supply and demand correspond. The government should stipulate a legal price and hand it over to silver and money shops in various places for circulation, and hoarding is not allowed. Because China is currently short of copper, a panic will definitely occur if it is allowed to be hoarded. This level must be considered first. I remember that in the 32nd year before the founding of the Republic of China, a great panic occurred in Ning'e due to the shortage of copper coins. Later, casting was rushed, and the price of copper soared, causing the treasury to suffer a great loss. In recent times, situations that have occurred in the world and in our own country, and historical precedents near and far in our country, can be examined in considerable detail. Therefore, it is impossible not to prevent this in advance. Various economic experts have issued very good opinions, and I will not talk about it anymore. I only hope that the whole country will study appropriate methods in practice and work together with one heart and one mind with the government to save the economic crisis.</p>

<p>Foreign Banks Awaiting Discussion Before Submitting Silver</p>
<p>The Daily News Agency reported that after the Ministry of Finance announced that the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, the Central Bank sent a letter to foreign banks yesterday, requesting them to hand over their silver in exchange for legal tender. A Daily News Agency reporter specifically inquired about everything from the "Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banks Association" yesterday. The president of the association is Manager McLeigh-Kelly, who was out at the time. Secretary Talbat received the reporter and stated that the matter had not been discussed at a meeting and it was inconvenient to make any comments. The official letter has now been distributed to various foreign banks. It is reported that most of the banks are likely to accept it and will be able to deliver all the silver to the Central Bank for exchange into legal tender within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Seek National Goods for Exhibition in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Special Request for Consul-General Song to Come to Shanghai for Negotiations and Letter to National Products Manufacturers Association for Assistance</p>
<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that the United Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies, the General Association of Overseas Chinese Importers, and the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce have jointly launched the "National Products Touring Exhibition in Southeast Asia" to promote trade in Southeast Asia and provide overseas Chinese in various places with the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of national goods. It is scheduled to be held in April next year. In addition to inviting Consul-General Song to come to Shanghai for negotiations, these organizations have also sent a letter to the Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association for assistance. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Consul Song's Letter: (Beginnings Omitted) I, Faxiang, am attending the Fifth National Congress and arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. I will enter Beijing tomorrow night. I plan to meet with your association during my stay in Shanghai to discuss the preparations for the National Goods Exhibition and report on the restrictions on imports by the Dutch East Indies authorities to seek advice. I respectfully request that you discuss this matter with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China in advance and designate a time and place for a meeting for this purpose. To the China National Products Manufacturers Association, Song Faxiang.</p>
<p>Letter from Overseas Chinese Merchants: It has been investigated that this port originally intended to invite representatives of domestic manufacturers who participated in the Singapore National Goods Exhibition of British Malaya to bring samples to Batavia for display. However, the representatives of the manufacturers were unable to complete the preparations in time due to the short time, and the progress was reported to the Ministry of Industry by our Consul-General Song stationed in Batavia for inspection. Now, we have received a notice from Consul-General Song, a letter from Mr. Wang Zhisheng, the chief representative of the Shanghai National Goods Manufacturers Delegation, stating that it has been decided to prepare for the National Goods Touring Exhibition in Southeast Asia in 1925, to be held in April next year. Taking advantage of the night markets held in various regions of the Dutch East Indies, the exhibition will tour Batavia, Bandung, Semarang, and Surabaya. This move is extremely important for the promotion of national goods and should be a priority for us to strive to prepare. It has been investigated that the largest-scale night markets held in the Dutch East Indies are the Gambir Night Market in Batavia, which is held from the end of August to the beginning of September each year, for about 10 or 14 days. All special products or manufactured goods from various islands of the Dutch East Indies are transported to the night market for exhibition and promotion. Hundreds of thousands of people from various ports and provinces come to visit. In recent years, an Annam Pavilion has been set up in the night market to exhibit and promote Annam's products. The pavilion is organized by the French Annam government, and all liaison matters here are presided over by the French Consul-General stationed in Batavia. Since the exhibitions over the years, it has given people here a very good impression of the local products. For the sake of promoting national goods in Southeast Asia, we should imitate the Annam method. Our association has held meetings to discuss and decided to set up a Chinese Pavilion to participate in the night market to be held in August next year, expand publicity, and facilitate promotion. Since many people from various ports come to Batavia to visit the Gambir Night Market, it seems unnecessary to expand the exhibition in Surabaya, Semarang, and Bandung to save costs. The cost of establishing the Chinese Pavilion is estimated to be about 3,000 guilders for construction and lighting. We plan to collect several types of goods for the Chinese Pavilion this time and display them in several rooms, which will require a certain amount of land. All of this should be prepared accurately, and the required expenses will inevitably be considerable. It is necessary to request a subsidy from the central government. All issues concerning the entry tax to be paid by each manufacturer's representative coming to Batavia for the exhibition and the permission for the entry of goods can be said to be the responsibility of Consul-General Song, who will liaise with the Immigration Bureau and the Ministry of Economy of the Dutch East Indies government. The round-trip tickets for the representatives coming to Batavia and Shanghai can also be handled by Consul-General Song, who will liaise with the Java Steamship Company and request a half-price discount. The Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce can raise 2,000 to 3,000 guilders to subsidize the expenses of this exhibition. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry of Industry for inspection and approval for a subsidy, our association has specifically invited Consul-General Song to be the plenipotentiary representative to be responsible for liaising with the Ministry of Industry, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to prepare for this matter. In addition to sending separate letters, this letter is sent to your association for your information. We hope that you will provide assistance when Consul-General Song visits your association to facilitate the progress. To the China Manufacturers Association, Jian Fuhui, Chairman of the United Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies; Liang Bingnong, General Affairs; Zhuang Xiyan, Chairman of the General Association of Overseas Chinese Importers; Lin Qiansun, General Affairs; Guo Tianru, Chairman of the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce; Wu Weikang, General Director.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Decides to Enter Beijing</h3>

<h3>Pledge Loan for Telegraph Administration Bonds Totaling Six Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Draft Contract Agreed Upon, to be Taken to Beijing for Report, Solely for the Development of Telegraph Administration</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications issued ten million yuan of Telegraph Administration Bonds, the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, led by Director Shen Shuyu, negotiated a pledge with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank, which was successful. The total amount was determined to be six million yuan. The contract has been negotiated and will be signed soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Amount Determined: Six Million Yuan</p>
<p>After negotiations between Shen Shuyu, Director of the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, Zhou Shouliang, Deputy Director, Zhou Youduan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications, and various banks, the total amount of the Telegraph Administration Bond pledge loan has now been determined. Bonds with a face value of ten million yuan will be pledged for six million yuan in cash at a 60% discount. The loan contract has been drafted and has been negotiated with the borrowing banks by Section Chief Zhou Youduan in recent days. Agreements have been reached on interest rates and terms. Only textual revisions remain.</p>
<p>Bank of China and Other Banks Separately Acknowledge Borrowing</p>
<p>The borrowing banks are the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Shanghai Bank, the Jin City Bank, the Continental Bank, the Yanyeh Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Kenye Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China National Goods Bank, and the Guohua Bank. The allocated amounts have been determined, ranging from ten thousand yuan to one million yuan. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank account for the majority. Except for the Central Bank, the other banks, such as the Bank of China and the Communications Bank, have decided to organize a syndicate to handle it. In the future, when the contract is signed, the Central Bank will sign a separate contract, while the others will sign a general contract.</p>
<p>After Draft Contract is Signed, Return to Beijing Immediately</p>
<p>Zhou Youduan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications, has decided that after the draft pledge loan contract is negotiated, he will first sign the draft contract, and then Section Chief Zhou will take the contract back to Beijing to report to Minister Zhu Jiahua. After the Ministry of Communications approves it, it will be formally signed. This loan is entirely for the development of the telegraph administration. It has been decided to first print pre-subscription coupons and then exchange them after the official bonds are printed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador Johnson Arrives in Beijing Today</h3>

<h3>Yuan Liang Visited Huang Fu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resting Briefly Before Entering Beijing to Report</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Peiping, resigned and was approved. He then took the Shanghai-Peiping train on the 4th and went south, not stopping in Beijing, but going directly to Shanghai. He arrived here at 7:40 yesterday morning. Liang Fuchu, director of the North Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Dagang, secretary to Huang Fu, and Yuan's relatives, friends, and former subordinates in Shanghai all went to the North Station to welcome him. The North Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau also sent a squad of police officers to the station to cooperate with the railway police to maintain strict security. After Yuan got off the train, he exchanged greetings with those who welcomed him and then took a car to rest at the residence of his friend on Yu Guo Road. At 8:30, he accompanied Wang Dagang in the same car to visit Huang Fu at his private residence on Qiqi Road to report on his resignation. It was not until around 11:00 that he left. According to Yuan's conversation with the Xin Xin News Agency reporter at the station, "I have been in politics for many years, and my mind and body are exhausted. I am very fortunate to be relieved of my responsibilities this time. After meeting with Chairman Huang in Shanghai, I will rest briefly and then enter Beijing to pay my respects to the Central Government and report everything. After that, I plan to stay in Shanghai to recuperate." He also said that his wife is still staying in Peiping to take care of household affairs and will start south as soon as she is finished.</p>
<h3>Ross Talks to Japanese Reporters About the New Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>Hoping that This Reform Will be Successful, Kong's Statement Has Five Elements, Budget Balance is Especially Important</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, Ross met with Ambassador Ariyoshi on the 4th and then invited reporters to express his views on the new monetary policy as follows: "The rumors that the United Kingdom is providing credit loans to China are completely unfounded. Originally, I had contacted the U.S. and Japanese ambassadors and the French side regarding the loan issue. I will never take a separate position, and it is not even the official time for loan negotiations. This reform of the national currency by the National Government is really a major decision by the Chinese government. Now that it has been implemented, I sincerely hope that it will be successful. In my opinion, the first half of Finance Minister Kong's statement is entirely the autonomy of the Chinese financial authorities. I really don't know what the future countermeasures will be, and it is difficult to predict. However, the second half of Minister Kong's statement, first, to maintain the credibility of the new policy, second, to realize the independence of the Central Bank, third, to seek foreign aid to a certain extent, fourth, to open up market blockages, and fifth, to balance the budget, are the fundamental elements of reform. Therefore, whether the new policy is successful or not depends on how these elements are realized. Among them, budget balance is especially important. The future of countermeasures is most related to assets. The cash held by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank is thirty million pounds sterling."</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Left Hangzhou for Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

After arriving in Shanghai, the group stayed at the Fengyang Hotel and were hosted at a banquet at the 63 Garden by the Shanghai branch of the Electric Communications Agency. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai at 9:00 this morning and return to Japan on the Shanghai Maru.</p>
<h3>Economic Doctorate Cheng Shaode's Opinion on the Currency Reform Bill</h3>
<p>Major Success Achieved After Long-term Implementation in European and American Countries, Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange and Commodity Prices Arise Without Impact</p>
<p>In order to stabilize finance, the Ministry of Finance officially telegraphed the implementation of the new currency system the day before yesterday. This matter has aroused significant attention both domestically and abroad. However, various circles may not yet fully understand the implementation of this new currency system. The Xin Shi News Agency reporter specially visited Dr. Cheng Shaode, an economist, yesterday, and he agreed to express his opinion on the currency reform bill in detail. The following is a special record:</p>
<p>The government announced six articles of currency reform on November 3. The main points are: first, the banknotes of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank shall be legal tender; second, the banknotes of other issuing banks shall continue to be used, but only to the total amount circulating as of November 3, and no additional issuance shall be allowed. The Ministry of Finance shall determine a deadline and gradually exchange them for Central Bank banknotes; third, establish a management committee for the issuance reserve, and centralize the custody of silver reserves; fourth, from November 4, silver coins are not allowed to circulate and should be immediately exchanged for legal tender; fifth, contracts denominated in silver coins shall be settled in legal tender; sixth, stabilize foreign exchange rates, and the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank shall buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. Splendid! This is truly the beginning of China's financial system entering the latest stage of world financial evolution. Such regulations, its position in China's future financial history, equals England's Peel's Act of 1844, and the French Bank's banknote regulations of 1848. Regarding the great achievements created in the financial history of England and France, and considering the situation, the results of the currency system bill announced by our government on the 3rd will even surpass them in the future. Since the British government formally stipulated the Bank of England's banknotes as legal tender in 1833, the basis for bank banknotes to become legal tender was established. After the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century, England subsequently experienced financial panic. At that time, in order to cope with the situation of cash payments, it was stipulated that Bank of England banknotes would be legal tender and replace the banknotes of other issuing banks. After implementation, significant success was achieved. After 1848, France, and after 1875, Germany, followed suit. After the European War, unprecedented changes occurred in currency systems around the world. In the past fifteen years, in European and American countries such as England, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany, the currency in circulation in the market has been the central bank's banknotes as legal tender. Except for auxiliary coins, no metal currency is used. Whether the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the French franc, the German mark, or the Italian lira was used in gold coins before the gold standard was abandoned, there were none. The currency in circulation in the market is entirely banknotes. All gold coins and gold are completely concentrated in the central bank. Except for the use of gold to offset the balance of international payments, there is no circulation of standard currency domestically. Even if cash is exchanged, the minimum amount for exchange is also stipulated, such as the exchange of French Bank banknotes, the minimum limit is still above 210,000 francs. Thus, banknotes are used domestically with gold as reserve, and gold is used externally to repay international debts. This is the guideline for the use of currency systems in recent European and American countries. In terms of its function, the currency in the market can be freely expanded and contracted, the price level can be controlled, and the national economy can also exert its effectiveness through currency management methods. It is reasonable that there are those in the world who use currency policy as a strategy for economic panic. Before the recent announcement of the bill, China's currency system was actually a chaotic monetary system. The issuance of banknotes was decentralized, and the currency in the market was still used in metal standard currency. Since the United States raised the price of silver, its weaknesses have become more obvious. Silver outflow is impossible to prevent, and there is no centralized management agency for market chips. It is clear that it cannot use currency politics to adjust financial seasons and control price level fluctuations. Now, our government has resolutely made a decisive decision to stipulate that the banknotes of the three banks are legal tender, silver standard currency is not allowed to circulate, the preparation of issuing banks is centrally managed, and it is stated that the banknotes of other banks shall be exchanged for central banknotes by the Ministry of Finance within a time limit. It is completely the same as the latest currency system in European and American countries. In the future, it will be beneficial to the development of our country's economy, and it is by no means superficial. Since the promulgation of this law, the world has praised it, but there are still two misunderstandings among the Chinese people. First, will prices rise as a result? Prices do not necessarily rise as a result of the new currency law. The surge in prices in the past two days is due to the volatility of people's hearts and the rise due to a misunderstanding of currency principles, which is often due to currency expansion. However, the government authorities have repeatedly stated that currency will never expand. If currency does not expand, prices will not rise casually. So, will prices in our country never rise in the future? Yes, they can rise and make the economy prosperous, but the reason for the rise can be due to the following two points. First, due to the reform of the currency system, market chips can obtain reasonable circulation, credit will not stagnate, and social purchasing power can be increased. Production and sales can be greatly increased, and prices will gradually return to normal. Thus, it can indirectly stimulate the development of domestic industry and commerce. Second, due to the improvement of the currency system, foreign exchange can be controlled. In recent years, our country's currency has been excessively valued due to the impact of silver prices, but this can be restored to normal. If so, the price of foreign currency will be high, the import cost of foreign goods will increase greatly, and the price of foreign goods will rise accordingly. As a result, it will be sufficient to encourage exports, reduce imports, and the international balance of payments can be adjusted. With these two reasons listed above, even if prices rise in the future, it is not the result of currency inflation, but the result of economic prosperity. In this way, the new currency law recently promulgated by our government is indeed beneficial to prices. Those who are terrified of the misunderstanding of currency inflation can be relieved. Second, will drastic changes occur in foreign exchange as a result? Our foreign exchange can be stabilized in the future, and the new law is sufficient to improve foreign exchange. Since August of last year, after the world silver price rose sharply, there have been two ways to determine our foreign exchange rate. First, to change with the changes in the world silver price, that is, to fluctuate around the parity price. If so, in recent years, our country's foreign exchange should fluctuate around 20 pence to 24 pence, but should not fluctuate around one shilling and five pence. Second, to break away from the world silver price and set the exchange rate by ourselves. The determination of our country's foreign exchange rate in the past year is the law. As a result, in fact, our country's foreign exchange has become the foreign exchange of a country that has abandoned the silver standard in the past year. The main cause of its changes is due to the need and supply of market drafts, or due to government control. However, in the past year, our country's foreign exchange has been very stable under the circumstance of breaking away from the silver price relationship. Anyone who is familiar with the recent year's determination methods of our country's foreign exchange, its principle, and its basis on the world gold price, and the power of foreign banks in the Shanghai market over the foreign exchange rate is known to be unavoidable. I have never heard of a powerful foreign bank praising our country's currency system policy. Under this situation, I don't think it will be difficult for me. Moreover, our government clearly ordered the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank to do their best to supply foreign exchange, and there are already preparations for coping with it. Therefore, our country's foreign exchange in the future is still stable at a point suitable for our country's economy. Based on the past three or four years of changes in our country's foreign exchange, and the recent abandonment of the gold standard in the foreign exchange balance of countries, recently our country's foreign exchange may be rationally stabilized as a result. The government's new currency bill recently has no major impact on the fluctuation of the foreign exchange rate in terms of the principle of foreign exchange change. Moreover, before and after the promulgation of this bill, our country's foreign exchange has in fact broken away from the silver price and consolidated its defenses. The future situation is still the same.</p>
<h3>Directors and Supervisors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Still Firmly Request Resignation</h3>
<p>Second Letter of Resignation Submitted to the Ministry, General Manager Liu Now Expresses Co-Movement</p>
<p>The directors of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ye Zhuotang, Zhang Shouchang, and others, as well as the supervisors Chen Guangfu, Lu Xuepu, and others, and General Manager Liu Hongsheng and others, previously submitted their resignations to the Ministry of Communications on the grounds that the bureau's finances were exhausted and operations were difficult. Since the date of submission, they have not been to the bureau to work. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, believed that the directors and supervisors had been in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for several years and had made significant contributions. At this time of active rectification, the government relied heavily on them. How could they resign so quickly? Therefore, he personally came to Shanghai to sincerely retain them. At that time, several directors and supervisors went to Japan with the economic inspection group and were not able to express their views definitively. On the 29th of last month, Supervisor Chen Guangfu and General Manager Liu Hongsheng returned to Shanghai from Japan and convened a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors to discuss the Ministry of Communications' retention. The directors and supervisors expressed that they had no opinion on whether to stay or leave, but there must be practical measures for the repayment of old debts and cash turnover in the future before they would agree to remain in office. Otherwise, even a skilled woman cannot cook without rice. Rather than occupying a seat without performing duties, it is better to give way to someone more capable. As a result, there were still no long-term strategies for future policies. Therefore, the directors and supervisors still expressed their firm resignation. They submitted a second letter of resignation the day before yesterday, and General Manager Liu Hongsheng will advance and retreat with the entire group. Therefore, although he had been to the bureau since returning to the country, he had not yet reported to the Ministry for leave. However, the bureau's affairs are proceeding as usual.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Zhongxing Road at Midnight, Police Officer Killed While Bravely Arresting Thieves</h3>
<p>Police Officer Entered with Gun, Thief Aimed at Chest and Killed Him, Shops in Zhabei Mourn Death and Discuss Subsidizing Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>Thieves in Zhabei are rampant, and robberies have occurred frequently recently. At 11:50 the night before, at No. 1229 in the small alley across from Zhaofengli (west of Gonghe Xin Road) on Zhongxing Road, at No. 22 and 23 of the tile bungalows (facing west and east, with a large open space in front, the place where fugitive soldiers were captured and straw sheds burned a few years ago), Zhang Guokang, a native of Gaoyou, 45 years old, lived by pulling rickshaws. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>Coveted by Thieves</p>
<p>When the rickshaw puller entered to hand over the shift, four thieves suddenly appeared, wearing blue cloth shirts and pants and black cloth vests and pants, speaking in a northern accent and Jiangbei accent, and showed three pistols, scaring them and first taking off one pair each of gold earrings from Zhang's wife, Cao, and his daughter-in-law, Jiang, and then robbing them of a total of 69 yuan and 6 jiao in cash and silver dollars from their persons. During the robbery, Zhang had a daughter named Xiaomei, 17 years old. After hearing the sound, she jumped out of the</p>
<p>Window Hole</p>
<p>Intending to rush to the Zhongxing Road Police Station to report. Because of injuries to both feet, she could not walk halfway and sat on the ground. At that time, an unnamed old vegetable buyer happened to pass by, and Xiaomei told him that there were robbers in her home. The vegetable buyer reported to the police station on her behalf. At this time, Tang Shangjin, the guard at the gate, who was on duty from 9:00 PM to 12:00 PM,</p>
<p>Was About to Go Off Duty</p>
<p>Therefore, Hao Likai and Zhuang Jingzao, the two police chiefs on duty, were preparing. Upon hearing the robbery report, one police chief immediately led the gate guard Tang Shangjin to rush to the scene. When Tang arrived at the entrance of the owner, he saw that the gate was half open. The police officer then pulled out his pistol and bravely stepped forward. Unexpectedly, at this time, the thieves had finished robbing and all four were gathered inside the gate. Because they wanted to fight to wear the copper helmet, they had not yet left. When the thieves saw the police officer Tang entering, they immediately aimed at the police officer's</p>
<p>Chest and Fired</p>
<p>After Tang was shot, knowing that he was injured, he immediately retreated. After walking about 20 steps, he fell to the ground in the alley. Later, the thieves saw that there was no one outside and fled one after another. The two police chiefs were lying in ambush on the side of the road, and when they saw that Tang was injured and fell to the ground, they rushed forward to chase regardless of their own safety. The thieves fired their pistols indiscriminately while fighting and fleeing.</p>
<p>But it Was Night</p>
<p>The area was all wasteland, so they were able to escape. When Xie Zhongyi, the patrol officer of the Zhongxing Road Police Station, heard the gunshots, he led a large group of police officers to rush to the scene. The thieves were nowhere to be found. He immediately called the fire department and sent an ambulance, but police officer Tang</p>
<p>Had Already Died</p>
<p>He also reported to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. Director Liao immediately ordered Liu Changpei, the chief of the detective squad on duty, to lead detectives Zhu Jinrong and Gan Nai to the scene. At the scene of the incident, they found two cartridge shells, which were picked up on the wasteland, and two copper helmets and two flashlights left by the robbers at the owner's house were taken into custody. Afterwards, the police station instructed Wang Shaoting, the local bailiff of Jin'ertu, to report to the Shanghai</p>
<p>Local Court</p>
<p>For autopsy. In the afternoon, at about 3:00 PM, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying, accompanied by clerk Zhang Guowei, arrived to examine the body. It was found that the deceased, Tang Shangjin, died from a gunshot wound sustained during his life. The bullet was still in his chest bone and had not penetrated. There was also no blood. The body was handed over to the police station for proper burial, pending the arrest of the murderer. It was also learned that the deceased was 33 years old, a native of Wuhu, Anhui, and had served for many years.</p>
<p>He Was Brave in His Work</p>
<p>He had a wife and daughter. His wife, Tang, was 24 years old, a native of Jiading, and his daughter was only 14 years old, born to his first wife. After this incident occurred, the local shops invited shop owners such as Hu Yibo, Ding Huaide of the Tongrentang pharmacy, Ding Shoupeng, Li Biaoyuan of the Sanmao Rice Store, Yu Liang of the Shunxin Distillery, Dai Enpu of the Renda Water Company, Ren Shitao of the Tongxinqia Water and Electricity Company, Tan Mingxian of the Sanfeng Rice Store, and others to discuss the matter, as the police officer died in the line of duty. In addition to asking the Xinzha Sub-bureau to find ways to provide preferential treatment, they will also subsidize the deceased's family for funeral expenses.</p>
<h3>Zhoujiazui Road Robbery: Two Victims Shot</h3>
<p>Qian Yixing Noodle Shop, located at number 763 Zhoujiazui Road near Gongping Road in Eastern Shanghai, had been closed since August due to poor business and financial difficulties, and has not yet reopened. Yesterday afternoon, the owner's married daughter, named Shuming (18 years old), went to the Qi family with a child to attend a wedding banquet. As it was still early, she stopped by her parents' home. However, Shuming was a young woman dressed in modern fashion, wearing several gold rings, and the child also wore a gold necklace. This attracted the attention of robbers. Around 6 p.m., several robbers suddenly broke in, pulled out weapons, and threatened them. While they were searching, Shuming's mother, Ms. Xiao (44 years old), and her uncle, Shengshen, were present. Ms. Xiao immediately shouted "Robbers!" One of the robbers fired a shot at her, hitting her right leg, and the bullet passed through. Shengshen was also shot twice, once in the head and once in the abdomen. Realizing they had caused a major incident, the robbers fled without stealing anything. By the time the police arrived, the robbers had vanished. Shengshen was taken to the Tongren Hospital by police car and is said to be seriously injured. Ms. Xiao was transferred to the Bazilu Sanatorium for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Prevent Abuses and Rectify Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of broadcasting stations in various parts of China has been increasing, and the number of people using radios has also been rising rapidly. The Ministry of Communications believes that broadcasting is of great importance to a nation's politics and culture. To ensure its proper function and prevent unexpected abuses, the Ministry is implementing strict supervision of broadcasting stations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Issuing Licenses</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications stipulates that the frequency used by broadcasting stations should be from 550 kHz to 1500 kHz, with a difference of 10 kHz between each station. In practice, permits have been issued for over ninety broadcasting stations. The Ministry believes that this frequency range is now fully allocated, and existing stations are in urgent need of reorganization. Therefore, the Ministry has suspended the issuance of any new permits.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Poorly Managed Stations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications closely monitors all broadcasting stations after they are approved for establishment. Those that are poorly managed will be dealt with accordingly. Serious cases will be punished. Recently, over ten stations have been cracked down upon. Some of these stations failed to establish themselves within the prescribed time after being approved. Others had faulty equipment and failed to comply with orders to improve. Some broadcast obscene content and refused to comply with orders to be punished. Others transferred or sublet their licenses without authorization.</p>
<p>Auditing Broadcast Programs</p>
<p>Regarding the broadcasting programs of each station, the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly issued instructions on what should be broadcast and what is prohibited. For the sake of convenience, the Ministry has specially ordered each station to submit a copy of its broadcast schedule. Future changes must be reported five days in advance. The Ministry plans to thoroughly review all collected broadcast schedules and make appropriate regulations regarding the general content of broadcasting stations and the allocation of time slots.</p>
<h3>Closing Arguments Concluded in the Major Post Office Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Monk Wukong's testimony was evasive, completely denying everything. Ji Wenbin reported to the police station and surrendered. The court has scheduled the verdict for next Wednesday.</p>
<p>The major robbery at the North Sichuan Road Post Office, where armed robbers stole a large sum of money and shot and killed a person, was investigated by detectives from the Dixciqi Road Police Station who went to Funing and other places in northern Jiangsu. They successively arrested the thief monk Wukong (i.e., Ji Rentang) and other men and women, recovering a small amount of the stolen money. They were repeatedly brought to the First Special District Court for trial, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon was the continuation of the trial. The detectives brought Ji Rentang, Qiu Guobin, Zhou Yaoshi, Liu Daosheng, Ji Wenbin, Li Xueshi, Li Yisheng, Wu Pangui, Wang Chenshi, Ji Chenshi, a total of ten men and women, to the waiting room of the Third Tribunal. Chen Qiushi had already been released on bail.</p>
<p>Failure to Appear</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m., Judge Meishuizi took the bench and ordered Li Yisheng and Wu Pangui to be brought before the court. He announced the verdict on the charges against them. Li was originally a tea worker on a ship. Because Wang Chenshi secretly sewed 1,000 yuan of the stolen money she had been given into a pillow and wrapped it up, intending to take it back to northern Jiangsu on the ship. Wang Chenshi was arrested en route, and her bedding was then kept by Li Yisheng. During a police search, the 1,000 yuan hidden in the pillow had disappeared. Therefore, the police accused Li of embezzlement. Judge Jiang sentenced him to three months in prison and a fine of 300 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he could commute it to one day of labor for every three yuan. Wu Pangui was a petition policeman sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the post office. Because he had</p>
<p>Participated in the Robbery</p>
<p>And was suspected of conspiring beforehand, he was prosecuted for inciting robbery. He and Chen Qiushi were acquitted. However, Chen Qiushi had already been released on bail and did not appear in court for the verdict. The court ordered Wu to provide a 500-yuan bond within the appeal period, otherwise he would remain in custody. After the verdict, Li and Wu were taken away by the detectives, and the remaining defendants, except for Li Xueshi, who remained in the waiting room, were brought to the courtroom. Judge Jiang questioned them repeatedly. Qiu Guobin admitted that Ji Rentang (i.e., Monk Wukong) had given him 250 yuan of the stolen money, which he had already spent. He also admitted to lending a black long gown to</p>
<p>Monk Wukong</p>
<p>Without reservation. However, he firmly denied paying expenses for the robbers beforehand. He also said that he had seen Wukong and others at Wang Chenshi's and Ji Chenshi's homes, meeting twice. Wang Chenshi testified that the robbers had met at her house four times. The first meeting was in June. After robbing the large sum of money, Wukong and I went to Zhabei that night and divided 7,000 yuan, half of which was given to Liu Xiaosizi. Qiu Guobin got 250 yuan, and Ji Chenshi got 200 yuan. So Wukong actually got 3,000 yuan, and gave me 1,000 yuan to deposit in Jin Cheng Bank. The next day, he fled back to northern Jiangsu, taking 1,000 yuan with him. The remaining 1,000 yuan he ordered me to take, so I hid it in the pillow. After being arrested, the money in the pillow had already disappeared. Ji Chenshi admitted without reservation to receiving 200 yuan. When questioned, Monk Wukong still</p>
<p>Evaded Responsibility</p>
<p>Not only did he completely deny his previous confessions to the police station, but he also denied the testimony he gave during interrogation by the Funing County Government when he was arrested in Funing. Zhou Yaoshi also only admitted to sharing an opium couch with Wukong at Wang Chenshi's house. He denied participating in the robbery conspiracy or receiving 150 yuan of the stolen money afterwards. Liu Daosheng claimed that he had been falsely accused by the defendant Ji Wenbin due to a grudge. Ji Wenbin testified that he was unemployed and was taken in by a man surnamed Liang to work as a cook. Liu was present at every meeting of Liang and others. The handgun was brought from northern Jiangsu by a man surnamed Chen. On the afternoon of September 8, they left Liang's house to rob, but</p>
<p>Did Not Return</p>
<p>Later, he met Chen, and learned that Liu had received stolen money and had it taken back to northern Jiangsu by his aunt. Therefore, he reported this matter to Huishi Police Station number 2977, etc. Judge Jiang, believing that the case had been thoroughly investigated, ordered the commencement of closing arguments. Lawyers were appointed to defend the defendants who did not have their own lawyers. First, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu spoke, distinguishing the criminal acts of each defendant. Although Wukong was extremely evasive, considering the testimony of the accomplices and various pieces of evidence, he was undeniably guilty. As for Ji Wenbin, who was able to detail the robbers' conspiracy plans, he was obviously part of the gang. His subsequent surrender was due to not receiving any stolen money or being unhappy with the small amount he received. His surrender was an act of venting anger and hoping to get a reward from the police station. He did not expect to</p>
<p>Fall Into a Trap</p>
<p>And should be punished according to the law. Then, the defendants' lawyers successively made their defenses. The court ordered that the verdict be announced next Wednesday afternoon. Finally, Li Xueshi was brought to the stand. He testified that Liu Xiaosizi's mother was being detained in Boting, Funing. He was sent by the landlord to Shanghai to find her daughter, Zhu Xiaomao. Zhu gave him over 200 yuan to take back home to pay for her mother's legal fees, etc. Judge Jiang believed that the part concerning Li Xueshi still needed to be investigated. He ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of the 19th of this month. Because Li had no bail, he was taken back to the police station along with Wukong and others for separate detention.</p>
<h3>Dismembered Human Arm Found in Cemetery Next to the Special Court</h3>
<p>From hand to wrist, the skin was completely yellowed. A rag picker caught a glimpse and screamed in terror.</p>
<p>—The Haining Road Police Station is now investigating—</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., in the Baoantang Cemetery next to the First Special District Court on the east side of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road, a rag picker from Tongzhou named Cui Shuangtao (17 years old) entered the cemetery from a gap in the short wall on the south side (near Alabaisi Gu Road) to scavenge. Because the cemetery had been abandoned for a long time, the weeds were knee-high. Cui pushed through the weeds, not far, he suddenly found a pair of dismembered arms on the ground. He was terrified, ran back, and exited the wall, still screaming. Passersby gathered. The Haizhao Road Police Station was notified and sent several Chinese and foreign detectives in a police car. They searched the area but found nothing other than the pair of arms already discovered. They took the arms back to the police station for study and investigation. They also summoned the rag picker for questioning and then released him. It is understood that the arms, from hand to wrist, were complete, and the skin had turned yellow, as if they had been discarded for several days.</p>
<h3>Shipowner Ni Abao Repeatedly Receives Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>Extorting 500 yuan. Duo Zhongkang and Ji Helin were arrested.</p>
<p>Shipowner Ni Bao, who lives at number 23 Weixinfang, Meibaige Battle, received a threatening letter on October 5, extorting 500 yuan. If he did not comply, he would be killed and the money was to be sent to the trash can at the entrance of the alley below the Wulong Jingshui Terrace on Xinzha Road. Someone would come to pick it up. Ni ignored the letter. Afterwards, Ni continued to receive five threatening letters. The fifth letter, received on the 4th of this month, demanded that the money be sent to the north end of Wuzhen Bridge in Zhabei. Ni reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent Detective Ma Zhongrong, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, to wait at Wuzhen Bridge on the evening of the 4th. Ni sent representative Pu Xingxian with a paper package. At 9:30 p.m., Duo Zhongkang, a native of Changshu, came to collect the money and was captured by the detectives. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau and brought back to the police station the day before yesterday. Under interrogation, he confessed that his accomplice, Ji Helin, was hiding at number 258 Xinzha Road. Ji was captured and both were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and explained the previous circumstances, requesting investigation. When questioned, Zhongkang admitted that all five threatening letters were written by him alone, but Ji Helin initiated the idea. Ji used to be a boatman at Ni Abao's place, but was dismissed and became extremely poor. He discussed writing a letter to Ni to borrow money, no matter how much, so he could return to his hometown, etc. Ji Helin also confessed without reservation. After Judge Wu verified the confession, he ordered the two defendants to be detained pending sentencing on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Drivers of Private Rickshaws Must Obtain Licenses Without Further Delay</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of self-use rickshaw pullers donating and obtaining new licenses, the Public Works Department previously issued Notice number 4637, which was published in various newspapers on the 22nd of last month, informing all car owners and pullers to quickly donate and obtain new licenses. However, since the issuance of the notice, only a small number of self-use rickshaw pullers have gone to the license issuing office to apply for new licenses. The previous self-use rickshaw licenses expired on September 30th of this year, and the new licenses are valid from October 1st of this year until September 30th of next year. It is now early November, and the deadline for donating and obtaining new licenses has passed for many days. They should not continue to wait and see, which would be detrimental to themselves. The license issuing office is located at the corner of Wusong Road and Bazilu, and office hours are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. All self-use rickshaw pullers should go to obtain licenses as soon as possible, bringing their existing license cards and a license fee of five dimes. They should know that the old licenses have now expired and cannot be used any longer.</p>

The arrangements in the research room and the guest calligraphy and painting area are all very elegant. It is reported that the garden has hired Xie Gongzhan, Jiang Jianbai, Hong Songjun, Bao Boqing, Yu Songru, and others as judges. Once the judging results are out, prizes will be awarded according to level. It is expected to be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Exhibition Held at Guyi Garden in Nanxiang</h3>

In October, spring returns, see the grand gathering of the garden. Sincerely."</p>
<h3>Sudden Cold Weather: Prevent the Spread of Smallpox and Diphtheria</h3>
<p>Those who have not been vaccinated against smallpox should be vaccinated quickly. Inject antitoxin to prevent diphtheria.</p>
<p>Yesterday the weather suddenly turned cold. If citizens do not take care of themselves, it will easily lead to disease. When the weather suddenly turns cold, the diseases most likely to spread are smallpox and diphtheria. As a preventative measure, citizens who have not been vaccinated against smallpox should go to the health offices in each district of the city and designated vaccination branches to get vaccinated to avoid contracting smallpox. To prevent diphtheria, parents should take children under the age of fifteen to hospitals or reputable doctors to inject antitoxin during this cold season when it is easy to spread. Injection can prevent infection. If one child in the family has diphtheria, the other children should be kept away from the sick child to prevent infection. These are important for our health, and it is hoped that citizens will pay attention, take preventative measures as soon as possible, and reduce the possibility of these diseases occurring.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau: Tea House Registration Deadline Today</h3>
<p>Registration of Employment Agencies to be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>The registration of tea houses by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which began on July 1, was originally scheduled to end at the end of last month. However, in order to avoid omissions, the Bureau extended the deadline by one week, setting today (7th) as the official deadline. Since April, approximately 1,400 tea houses have applied for registration, of which over 700 have been approved and over 600 have been rejected. Once the registration is officially closed, those whose registration has been rejected will be ordered to close down. Furthermore, after the Bureau decided to rectify the employment agencies in the city starting on the 1st of this month, it has been sending personnel to investigate the internal situation of each agency in recent days, looking for any cases of abduction or other illegal activities. Starting next month, it will conduct the registration of each agency and limit the establishment of new agencies in the future, in order to thoroughly eliminate the various illegal activities of employment agencies in the past.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Petitions the Municipal Government to Ban Dance Halls</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government should strictly prohibit the nightly revelry and dancing that squanders the ambition of youth in order to salvage decent morals.</p>
<p>Dagong News: The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation received letters from the 7th, 18th, 27th, 35th, 38th, and other branches, stating that the abnormal development of dance halls in the city attracts young men and women, not only consuming huge amounts of money and the ambitions of young people, but also fostering an atmosphere of decadence. At a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, our young people should be especially vigilant about their future and work together to overcome national difficulties. After approving the letter, the Citizens' Federation petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday to implement a ban. The original petition is recorded below. We petition for a ban on the operation of dance halls in order to salvage decent morals and maintain public interests. According to the letters from the 7th, 18th, 27th, 35th, 38th, and other branches of this federation, the operation of dance halls has developed abnormally in recent years, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Every night, they attract young men and women, reveling and dancing throughout the night, not only causing decent young people to squander their ambitions and consume huge amounts of money, but also fostering an atmosphere of decadence. The Ministry of Education has explicitly banned middle school and above students from participating in dancing, which shows that dancing is an indecent form of entertainment. At a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, patriotic young people should be especially vigilant about their future and work together to overcome national difficulties. Today, dance halls use licentious entertainment to harm the bodies and minds of young people, which is intolerable to the society and the nation. Therefore, we specially jointly request that the authorities be petitioned to promptly ban them. After careful discussion by the fifth executive committee of this federation, it was said that proper dancing is inherently a form of physical exercise and should not be criticized too harshly. However, today's dance halls in the city are aimed at making profits, and their extravagance has reached the extreme, harming good morals and being nothing short of a trap for young people. Moreover, at a time when national crisis is pressing and disasters are severe in various places, this display of extravagant and licentious joy is even more heartbreaking. If it is not banned, it will directly harm the bodies and minds of young people and destroy the lifeblood of the country. The harm caused will also affect public interests. Look at today's rampant theft cases. Investigating the reasons, it is because these people live dissolute lives and indulge in extravagance and debauchery. Therefore, tolerating the existence of dance halls is sufficient to cause great chaos and increase social unrest. Therefore, it was decided to request that the authorities promptly order a ban. Even if there are practical difficulties and it is inconvenient to take severe measures at once, in the view of this federation, the following two restrictions should be implemented first: (1) The authorities should stop issuing licenses for the operation of new dance halls in the future; (2) The operating hours of dance halls should not exceed 12 p.m. in order to gradually achieve the goal of banning them. The matter concerns social stability and public interests, so we specially petition your government to approve and implement a ban in order to correct good morals and maintain public interests. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely presented to Wu, the Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government (The wording of the letter to the Public Works Department is omitted).</p>

<h3>Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company: Passenger Cars Fitted with Wood-Burning Generators as a Substitute for Oil, Formal Contract Signed with Zhongming Factory</h3>
<p>According to customs reports, the annual excess of gasoline imports exceeds 100 million yuan. At present, gasoline prices have risen by two-tenths, so the excess of imports will also increase by two-tenths. Patriotic people are all thinking of ways to stop this leak. Therefore, the wood-burning generator invented by Tang Shenming has been noticed and valued by the Chinese people. The Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company test-fitted it to a large passenger car a month ago and ran it between Shanghai and Changshu. The results were not bad. Its speed is slightly lower than gasoline, but it can still travel at up to 40 miles per hour. According to the company's regulations, such a speed is not required. If the speed can be maintained between 25 miles per hour and 30 miles per hour, it is sufficient for the application of long-distance bus companies. If the cost of consumption is considered, it can save two-thirds of the cost. Therefore, the general manager of the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company, Wang Xiaolai, and the manager, Zhu Kaichou, were concerned about the increasing price of gasoline and felt that it had an impact on the company's expenditure. Seeing that the test use of the wood-burning generator by the company was still good, they resolutely decided to convert all of the large passenger cars to wood-burning generators and formally signed a contract with the Zhongming Factory at the Dengtuomo Hotel on the 5th of this month, setting a completion date of three months. Those present at the time included the general manager of the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company, Wang Xiaolai, the manager, Zhu Kaichou, the director of the engineering department, Wang Zongshan, the director of the vehicle department, Wu Zhongyi, and others. The representatives of the Zhongming Factory included the general manager, Fan Zhengbo, the engineer, Tang Zhongming, and others. Everyone parted on good terms.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's Youth Concert at the Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<p>During the last meeting convened by the Municipal Council's Music Committee, it was decided to hold two special concerts suitable for young people within this year, and the dates were agreed upon as November 8th and December 20th. Therefore, tomorrow is the date of the first special youth concert, still at the Lyceum Theatre, at 5:15 PM. The purpose of holding such youth concerts is not only to give young people ninety minutes of musical enjoyment but also to develop their musical appreciation while listening to music. Therefore, the Municipal Council Orchestra has put a lot of effort into selecting the program for this concert. The conductor will explain the structure, musical themes, and advantages of each piece to the audience before the performance, with "The Making of Music and its Main Forms" as the general title of the first youth concert lecture. During the lecture, the orchestra conductor will strive to avoid all advanced artistic terms and will not involve the analysis of the highest forms of music. He will only use simple language and basic theory to explain how composers combine thoughts and sounds in each piece. Furthermore, to help beginners understand various musical rhythms, several dances from different countries have been specially selected as the main body of this program, so that beginners can understand and appreciate them intuitively.</p>

<h3>Opium Addict Loses Opium Cessation License</h3>
<p>Whether to Investigate Unpurchased Official Soil</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Shanghai County Magistrate Ye Zhendong has drafted two measures regarding how to handle the loss of opium cessation licenses by opium addicts and has submitted them to the Civil Affairs Department for review. It is now heard that the provincial government has revised the measures as follows: (1) If an opium addict loses his opium cessation license and takes the initiative to report it for reissuance before it is discovered, in addition to handling it in accordance with Article 11 of the Jiangsu Province Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium Addiction within a Specified Period, it should also be investigated whether he has failed to purchase official soil and should be severely punished according to law. (2) If an opium addict loses his opium cessation license and does not report it for reissuance according to law, after it is discovered, in addition to handling it in accordance with Article 11 of the Jiangsu Province Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium Addiction within a Specified Period, it should also be investigated whether he has failed to purchase official soil and should be punished accordingly. If someone, after obtaining an opium cessation license, has not purchased official soil according to the regulations and falsely claims to have lost the license in the hope of secretly purchasing private goods, he will be dealt with as a private addict. The above two measures have been ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to be followed.</p>

<h3>Opium Addicts in Longhua on Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>Punish the Leaders to End the Disturbance - Zhang Houyuan from Ningbo, a coppersmith, and Zhou Zhiliang, a peddler, were both deeply addicted to opium. Knowing that the prohibition of opium was strict and they were unable to register, they voluntarily went to the Longhua Shanghai Municipal Criminal Addiction Rehabilitation Hospital for treatment. In order to eliminate opium addiction and encourage voluntary cessation, the hospital admitted them. However, these inmates usually did not comply with the hospital rules, and recently incited other inmates to demand a complete hunger strike on various pretexts. The hospital director's persuasion was ineffective, so he sent the two leading opium addicts, Zhang and Zhou, to the Caojing Police Station to inquire about the situation and transfer them to the headquarters for punishment according to the law. At this point, the remaining inmates realized they had been deceived and declared to the director that they had been completely blindly following and begged for leniency. The director, considering their ignorance, agreed to lenient treatment, and the hunger strike ended.</p>

Neighbors, feeling injustice, reported it to the police, who detained Chen in the police station. The injured boy was sent to the Wusong Health Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Wang was already unconscious upon arrival at the hospital. Despite the doctor's efforts to save him, his injuries were too severe and could not be reversed, and he soon died. Yesterday afternoon, the local guarantor reported it to the local court for an autopsy. Inspector Xiao and coroner Shen from the Prosecutor's Office arrived at the hospital and confirmed that Wang Guisheng died as a result of injuries. They filled out the form and ordered the coffin to be prepared, and the police station would transfer Chen to the case for interrogation and legal action.</p>

Shi, in order to hitch a ride, jumped onto the truck. When the truck reached the front of the private residence of the Japanese Minister near the intersection of Route Dollfus and Route Tenant de la Tour, Shi had reached his destination.

<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Bureau</p>
<p>3.  Observational Analysis of Changes by Industry</p>
<p>To study the rise and fall of various industries, it is necessary to pay attention to the changing figures between them. Now, the new establishments in various industries for the twenty-third year and the first half of this year are listed in the table below: (Unit: One)</p>
<p>New Establishments　Reorganization　Closure</p>
<p>Year 23　First Half of Year 24　Year 23　First Half of Year 24　Year 23　First Half of Year 24</p>
<p>Banks　6　3　1　6　9</p>
<p>Special Industries　Native Banks　3　26　2　8　8</p>
<p>Silver Houses, Exchange Shops, etc.　2　6　14　1　4</p>
<p>Brokers　11　7　4　17　4　10</p>
<p>New Establishments　Reorganization　Closure</p>
<p>Year 23　First Half of Year 24　Year 23　First Half of Year 24　Year 23　First Half of Year 24</p>
<p>Cotton Mills　2</p>
<p>Other Textile Industries　2　59　31　9　11</p>
<p>Metal Industry　3　28　20　7　7</p>
<p>Chemical Industry　2　19　8　8　2</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry　Rubber Industry　15　1　5　5</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Industry　15　3　71　40　24　7</p>
<p>Cigarettes　5　1　3　2</p>
<p>Flour　2　1　1　1</p>
<p>Other Food and Beverage Industries　8　1　90　17　13</p>
<p>Woolen, Silk and Cloth　7　3　30　28　18　10</p>
<p>Hardware Stores　7　3　26　21　30　12</p>
<p>Retailers　Department Stores　9　4　170　96　80　44</p>
<p>Food and Beverages　3　2　378　239　76　45</p>
<p>Cigarette Exchange　2　4　80　1</p>
<p>Others　69　20　354　315　72　73</p>
<p>Total　147　48　390　931　366　250</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that in recent years, in addition to general industry and commerce, the financial industry has also fallen into the furnace of recession. Other major industries, such as cotton mills, rubber, cigarettes, and flour, are all lifeless. The factories that have reduced work or partially stopped work are not included.</p>
<p>4.  Analysis of the Reasons for Changes</p>
<p>It is also quite interesting to study the reasons for changes between industries. Usually, in addition to new establishments, reorganization and closure must have very obvious reasons, such as political reasons, such as wars and government recovery of state-owned enterprises, or general economic reasons, such as market decline, sluggish business, and dumping of foreign goods, or internal pathologies, such as disagreement and fraud. The reasons for the reorganization of various industries and businesses in Shanghai in the 23rd year and the first half of this year are analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Households in Year 23　Percentage　Number of Households in First Half of Year 24　Percentage</p>
<p>Market Depression and Losses　69　4.96　158　16.65</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties　5　0.34　18　1.90</p>
<p>Internal Disagreement or Fraud　32　2.32　21　2.22</p>
<p>Unwilling to Operate　58　4.23　349　36.78</p>
<p>Shareholders Splitting Shares　6　0.44　157　16.54</p>
<p>Owner's Death or Inability to Manage　71　5.14　68　7.16</p>
<p>Expansion of Scale　19　1.37　7　0.74</p>
<p>Others　18　1.30　8　0.84</p>
<p>Unknown Reason　579　41.90　163　17.17</p>
<p>Total　1383　100　949　100</p>
<p>(Note) The total number of households is higher than the original figure because the reasons for the reorganization of one household often involve more than one. Now, the reasons for the closure of various industries and businesses in Shanghai in the 23rd year and the first half of this year are analyzed again.</p>
<p>Number of Households in Year 23　Percentage　Number of Households in First Half of Year 24　Percentage</p>
<p>Market Depression and Losses　149　35.06　133　49.26</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties　54　12.71　68　25.19</p>
<p>Internal Disagreement and Fraud　28　6.59　11　4.07</p>
<p>Affected by Losses and Closures in Other Industries　14　3.30　3　1.11</p>
<p>Others　19　4.47　3　1.11</p>
<p>Unknown Reason　161　37.87　52　19.26</p>
<p>Total　425 (Note)　100　270 (Note)　100</p>
<p>(Note) The total number of households is higher than the original figure because the reasons for the closure of one household often involve more than one. According to the above two tables, apart from a part of unknown reasons, in the first table, the number of those who are unwilling to operate is the most, followed by market depression and losses, and most of those who are unwilling to operate are due to market depression and difficulty in maintaining, so the two are actually similar. The sum of the two items was 653 in the 23rd year, accounting for 47.19%, and in the first half of the 24th year, there were 507, and the percentage also rose to 53.43. The number of those who reorganized due to expansion of scale was the least, accounting for only 1.37% in the 23rd year, and further decreased to 0.74 in the first half of the 24th year. In the second table, the most numerous is also market depression, followed by financial difficulties. The number of households in the two items in the first half of the 24th year is almost equal to the whole year of the 23rd year, and the percentage has increased sharply from 47.77 to 74.45. In summary, the industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai seems to be still struggling in exhaustion. The way to revival has been discussed by many contemporary sages, and it is not within the scope of this article, so I will not elaborate on it.</p>
<p>Corrigendum: There were errors in the arrangement of numbers in the change table published yesterday. Now, it is corrected as follows: the number of new establishments in September of the 23rd year was 78, not 100; the number of reorganizations in December of the same year was 91, not 15; the number of closures in January and February of the same year was 28 and 27, not 118 and 117.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Inspects Students in the Capital City and Strictly Orders Correction of Student Uniforms and Living Habits. The Capital City Social Affairs Bureau Immediately Convened a Meeting of School Principals to Discuss Measures.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th dispatch) Chairman Chiang recently inspected the uniforms and living habits of students in various schools in the capital city and believes that they urgently need to be rectified. He sent a letter to Director Wang of the Department of Education, stating that the uniforms and hats of students in various schools in the capital are mostly untidy and unclean. He should strictly order the principals of each school to pay special attention to rectification. When students enter the school for class, each teacher should be responsible for checking and correcting them. In general, hats must be worn straight and clothes must be worn tightly, so as to avoid developing a slack habit. Students wearing yellow uniforms should preferably wear belts to tighten them. He also said that it is not appropriate for middle school students to grow long hair. The rectification will be easier if principals and teachers set an example. It is best for principals and teachers to wear uniforms when they are at school. He also said that the students in the capital lack neatness and seriousness in terms of clothing and actions, and the Social Affairs Bureau and the principals of each school must be instructed to correct them seriously. After receiving the letter, Wang Jiao has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and principals to formulate strict measures for the rectification of students' clothing system and the revitalization of their daily life and actions, in order to achieve practical improvement, and will urge all schools across the country to pay attention to improvement.</p>

<h3>Little Men (87)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Clothes torn, dirty, emaciated, exhausted—it was his awakening—one foot bare, the other bound with an old yellowed tunic, clearly taken from his own back to wrap some wound. He seemed to want to hide behind a haystack, but a unconsciously stretched out arm in his sleep made him discovered. He sighed, mumbled, as if he was having a nightmare, and once he moved, he groaned as if in pain, but he was so sleepy that he soon fell asleep again.</p>
<p>"He shouldn't be sleeping here," said Mrs. Bhaer, and then bent over him and gently called his name. He opened his eyes and looked at her, as if she was also part of a dream, for he smiled hazily and said, "Mother Bhaer, I have returned."</p>
<p>His expression and few words touched her deeply. She reached out to his head, helped him up, and said in her earnest manner:</p>
<p>"I thought you would come back. I'm very happy to see you, Don." At this time, he seemed to have suddenly woken up, and suddenly looked around him, as if he suddenly remembered where he was, and even doubted the earnest welcome. His face changed abruptly, and he said with his old rough spirit:</p>
<p>"I was going to leave tomorrow morning. I only stopped halfway to take a look."</p>
<p>"Why don't you come in, Don? Didn't you hear me calling you? Tandy saw you and shouted to see you."</p>
<p>"I thought you might let me in," he said, already picking up a small bag and turning it over and over, as if he was about to leave immediately.</p>
<p>"You should try," Mrs. Bhaer replied simply, pointing her finger at the door of the house, where the shimmering lights could be seen, as if welcoming distant guests.</p>
<p>Don sighed a long sigh, as if a heavy stone had been dropped from his heart, then picked up a rough stick and began to limp towards the house, suddenly stopping, as if asking:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Meeting Has Not Yet Made a Concrete Decision</p>
<p>But Participation in the World Games Should Not Be a Problem</p>

<h3>French Professional Tennis Player Ke Xian'aide Cancels Trip to Shanghai</h3>
<p>He Linxiao Receives a Telegram from Hong Kong and Decides to Abandon the Plan</p>
<p>The news that French professional tennis player Ke Xian'aide would come to Shanghai for a performance, was revealed by Qiu Feihai, who planned to take the French mail ship Zhennusha from Hong Kong, and was expected to arrive yesterday. Therefore, the reporter inquired with He Linxiao, president of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club. According to He, based on Ke's telegram from Hong Kong yesterday, the plan to come to Shanghai has been completely abandoned. Ke had high hopes for income from performing in Shanghai. His contact with Qiu required at least 7,000 yuan before he would come to Shanghai, and the performance was only two days, and there was a lack of opponents. Even if Canafanlo was to compete, the skill level was too different. Ke Xian'aide had conceded two games in Hong Kong, but still lost 6-3, 6-4. This time, the assistant did not come either, so it was difficult to have a wonderful performance, so he had to give up.</p>

<h3>Coins Exchanged for Banknotes, Six to Seven Million</h3>
<p>Corner Dollars Secretly Opened at Eleven Jiao and Nine Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver industry was mostly calmed after the government reformed the currency system and centralized cash. However, small money merchants in the middle and lower classes were still half-doubtful. Inland neighboring areas, such as big towns, were shipping banknotes to Shanghai for use. Yesterday, it was estimated that another 1.5 to 1.6 million were shipped. However, the market situation announced by the money industry market was generally stable, so the foreign exchange split was still the same. The morning and noon markets were both one jiao and eight fen. The marking and adding water were not counted in the market, and were written off. In the banknote splitting transaction, the morning market had a transfer of more than 3.2 million, the new transaction was more than 400,000, the noon market transaction was more than 200,000, and the small general association had a transaction of more than 300,000. The marking and adding water situation was gradually becoming balanced. There was no news of banknotes being recovered, and the amount issued by exchanging coins and using silver coins totaled no less than six to seven million. In the foreign exchange pledge transaction, more than 400,000 were redeemed, and more than 1.2 million were newly made. It is heard that the loan bank organized by the government will soon be realized, and from then on, the mortgage of real estate can gradually become active. Money shops collected and resolved more than 52 million foreign public bills, more than 3.2 million foreign marking bills, and more than 300,000 from various routes. The banks collected and resolved bills and payments. Yesterday was still the third day of the Western Merchants' horse race, so the customs were still closed in the afternoon. Foreign banks collected and resolved more than 1.4 million bills and payments, more than 3.4 million miscellaneous payments for various goods and exchange pledges, more than 500,000 telegraphic transfers, and more than 400,000 special transfers. Chinese merchants' banks collected and resolved more than 2 million bills and payments, more than 3.6 million miscellaneous payments for various goods and tax pledges, more than 700,000 special transfers, and more than 900,000 telegraphic transfers.

The prices of various auxiliary currency markets were all the same on the surface and had not changed. However, private secret markets were also opened among small money shops. Corner dollars, regardless of single or double corners, were all eleven jiao and nine fen per foreign dollar. Copper coins were stable and unchanged because the overall supply and demand was moderate. The transactions made were generally without a basis, so they could not be calculated. It is observed that the current trend is to reform the currency system, which is an unprecedented event for thousands of years. It is not easy to maintain such a stable market situation now. Therefore, in the future, it will rely on the unanimous support of the financial community and the leaders of the entire commercial field for the government's painstaking reform intentions, and the prosperity of the market will soon be realized. In addition, the total number of documents at the clearing house on the 6th was national currency 14,449,189 yuan and 4 cents, including a total exchange of 19,339,307 yuan and 3 cents, a total collection of 2,855,553 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen for the money industry, and 2,296,628 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen for others.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bonds Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and the market were relatively stable. The downward trend seemed to have slightly subsided. An excessive rise was expected to trigger a reaction. The bull position of No. 78 had already turned into a short position. The northern syndicate also sold off their holdings. Numbers 54 and 63 also emerged from their holdings. The stormy weather was gradually calming down, and rumors resurfaced in the market, but they were all unfounded. Only two trading sessions were conducted yesterday. In the morning session, the initial auction showed a slight increase, but it wasn't very strong. The No. 19 bond, which had previously hit the daily limit down, only recovered a little over one yuan. Due to the frenzied selling of No. 6, the upward momentum of the military bonds also gradually weakened. Numbers 20 and 78 from the northern syndicate were both selling. Most of the retail investors in the bull position also exited the market. Starting from the forward No. 20 bond, selling pressure increased, and the trend gradually declined. All subsequent bonds went downstream. The salt tax bond was down slightly more than one yuan for this month. In the afternoon session, although the trend was still chaotic, market sentiment had weakened, and most investors found it difficult to struggle. The military bonds fluctuated by a small fraction of a yuan to about one yuan. No. 19 bonds showed a slight increase of five to six jiao. Due to the hedging or arbitrage activities of long and short positions, the No. 20 bonds showed mixed trends. Subsequently, the downward trend intensified, with the No. 23 bond falling by as much as one yuan and three jiao. The northern syndicate and Numbers 54 and 63, among others, were selling. The situation remained chaotic, and the future is likely to be volatile. The market prices from the two sessions were also quite disorderly. Generally speaking, the earlier bonds, from the military bonds to the No. 20 bonds, generally rose by one or two jiao to one yuan and one and a half jiao. The later bonds showed smaller fluctuations, with some bonds falling by several jiao to one yuan and four and a half jiao. The total transaction volume amounted to 32.08 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Marked Yarn Market Gradually Becomes Moderate</h3>
<p>The yarn market advanced and then retreated, with the situation gradually becoming moderate. However, a certain party continued to hold onto a large amount, refusing to let go. Changfeng took advantage of the lower prices to absorb more, with increasing determination. The market's available supply was drying up. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market was developing further. The Hunan syndicate was particularly eager to buy, boosting morale. In the afternoon, slightly negative news emerged, causing the market price to fall back, but new sellers were not eager to sell.</p>
<p>Changfeng's Appetite Undiminished</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the marked yarn market, all months rose in unison, indicating a tight market. Short sellers appeared to be startled birds, afraid to take action rashly. Changfeng and the securities syndicates also came to buy, causing the market to gradually tighten. However, the Jinzi syndicate and Tongcheng Company sold off their holdings. As a result, all months rose by 1.60 yuan to 2.50 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the April contract, which only rose by 0.70 yuan. The market suddenly reversed in the afternoon opening, weakening due to the decline in raw cotton prices, causing market sentiment to soften. The market price tended to decline. As a result, all months fell by 1.30 yuan to 2.40 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 2,700 bales, Shenji sold 900 bales, Tongji sold 450 bales, Runkang sold 1,750 bales, Xincheng sold 1,400 bales, Dafeng sold 1,600 bales, and Zhenda sold 450 bales. Taifeng bought 1,250 bales, Jinchang bought 1,500 bales, Minghua bought 1,650 bales, Gengfeng bought 950 bales, Changfeng bought 3,200 bales, and Shenji bought 900 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Stock Account</p>
<p>November 197.0 195.1 195.1 Increase 0.30 26,000</p>
<p>December 197.8 196.1 196.1 0.60 47,000</p>

<p>Total 196,700</p>
<p>Hunan Syndicate Emerges to Purchase Spot Goods</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are still brisk, with Hunan and Changsha syndicates being the most active buyers. It was found that a total of 1,385 bales were purchased throughout the day. The market price was the same as the previous day. The Shenxin factory opened up a large amount of spot yarn, with 655 bales going to inland areas, 60 to Shantou, 70 to the same trade, 5 to Ningbo, 575 to Changsha, 10 to Nanjing, 5 to Chaozhou and Wuhu, and 5 to Xiamen and Dou.</p>
<h3>Sellers Appear in the Forward Marked Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with the bearish sentiment still strong. A portion of investors were keen to see high prices, pulling in a large amount, causing the market to tighten. Changfeng and Changhe frequently bought in large quantities. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that imported cotton would be tax-exempt, with proposals supposedly submitted to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. As a result, speculators became suspicious.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rises in the Morning, Falls Back in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, all months moved upwards in unison. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the market atmosphere was particularly strong. Changfeng and Guangfeng bought in large quantities, making the market even tighter. As a result, all months rose by 0.30 to 0.60 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, Dafu and Tongzhou spot cotton merchants actively sold short the near-term contracts. The market suddenly weakened at the afternoon opening, and the downward trend resurfaced due to rumors that the import tax on American cotton was 5.65 yuan per picul. Speculators were thus active in selling, causing the market to fall. However, Changfeng and Changhe continued to buy. The closing price then rebounded by 0.20 yuan. As a result, all months fell by 0.30 to 0.50 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongfu sold 3,900 dan, Dafu sold 12,400 dan, Renfeng sold 1,300 dan, Yuan Yi sold 1,500 dan, Xincheng sold 2,200 dan, Tongji sold 4,500 dan, Yongda sold 1,700 dan, Tonghe sold 1,400 dan, Xinhua sold 1,500 dan, and Yikang sold 1,500 dan. Dafeng bought 2,300 dan, Zhenda bought 1,300 dan, Gengfeng bought 9,500 dan, Changfeng bought 10,700 dan, Runkang bought 4,100 dan, Changhe bought 5,800 dan, and Minghua bought 1,500 dan.

<h3>New Orleans Cotton Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York Cotton Exchange was closed due to the election holiday, and there were no market conditions. In New Orleans, due to positive news from Liverpool and frost in western Oklahoma and Texas, market conditions were firm. All months rose by one to four points. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, while futures rose by three points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to selling by operators, but later became firm due to positive Liverpool telegrams and buying by brokers. The prices for Pingguoer fell by half a rupee, Aomula fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 5th).</p>

<h3>Food: Long Positions Unload Distant Month Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months fell sharply across the board. Because of the quotation for foreign barley, in both Chicago and Canada, prices fell by about 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Market sentiment, seeing the weakness of foreign barley, predicted that the future supply of foreign barley would eventually be sufficient. Afterwards, due to demand, the government may have to take this into consideration. As for speculators outside the industry, their enthusiasm has waned, and most are taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, opening prices were weak. Afterwards, with long positions being actively sold, the decline in distant month flour prices was even more severe, falling by a massive 0.35 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was lighter, and the market became more stable. Due to still tight spot demand, the market sentiment for this month was weak but recovered. For distant months, market sentiment remained weak, and there was concern that prices might continue to fall back.</p>

<h3>March Contract Wheat Falls 0.18 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat futures market, both in the morning and afternoon, asking prices for all months fell sharply across the board. Because of few transactions during the morning sessions, both buyers and sellers took a wait-and-see approach, and the market was stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the sharp decline in marked flour prices, the issue of currency inflation came to an end. Once the objectives of all parties were revealed, speculators had no opportunity to exploit them. As a result, market sentiment was greatly weakened, and inexperienced long positions were actively liquidated. Near-term contracts fell sharply by 0.10 yuan, and distant-term contracts, such as the March contract, fell by as much as 0.18 yuan. From this observation, it is clear that the frenzied rise a few days ago was indeed driven by speculation. Spot wheat prices, due to the consistent decline in marked flour and wheat prices, also fell by 0.05 yuan. Opening prices were 4.80 yuan for Kaishan East and West Ping wheat, 4.70 yuan for Hankou wheat, and 4.65 yuan for Shaoxing wheat. A total of 3,000 bags were taken by Xinda.</p>

<p>Abundant Arrivals; Rice Prices Fall Again by 0.60 to 0.70 Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various syndicates were abundant, arriving at No. 78 (a total of over 15,000 shi), causing market sentiment to turn downward and prices to plummet. Prices for thick and thin new japonica rice, as well as damaged rice and Du Yangjian rice, fell by 0.60 to 0.80 yuan. Yinbian Yuan rice also decreased by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. However, market conditions in the afternoon showed renewed activity due to the sharp decline, and sales were particularly brisk. Customers even purchased 1,500 to 1,600 bags of new goods from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao syndicates.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various rivers were gradually increasing, with about 40 to 50 vessels carrying various goods. The morning market was still sluggish, causing prices to fall again by 0.50 to 0.60 yuan. Afterwards, due to improved purchases by shops, the market for new japonica rice recovered by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Customer varieties fell again by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan in the evening, Yangbu Jian rice fell by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan, and 100 yuan also fell by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. In the afternoon, prices for all goods showed signs of stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Foreign Buyers and Hoarders Seek to Exit</h3>
<p>Northern Ocean Sales Have Weakened... Prices Fall Slightly by 0.20 to 0.60 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of foreign xiang rice continued to be abundant, with most of the goods already arriving at the port. However, sales were sluggish. The Northern Ocean syndicate had already handled a large amount of goods in recent days, and their purchase intentions had weakened. Hoarders, seeing the unfavorable situation in all directions, were keen to exit the market at the current price. New purchases stopped, and purchases from Mujie were limited. The market immediately trended downward. The arrival and storage of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice were both abundant, and prices suddenly fell by 0.50 to 0.60 yuan. Other goods fell by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. A total of 530 bags of Jiangxi rice, 75 bags of Yongbo rice, 2,000 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, and 500 bags of Hankou rice were sold, all of which were handled by this street. Due to the scarcity of floating storage for foreign rice, hoarders were unwilling to sell at lower prices. However, some merchants and hoarders, unwilling to persist, offered 500 bags of Xiaojiao Saigon No. 1 and Siamese broken rice, with prices falling by about 0.20 yuan each, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign-Sourced Sesame Falls Again by 0.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign-sourced sesame fell again by 0.20 yuan, with 500 tons traded. Contracts were still for delivery in November and December. Yihua handled the import of spot sesame, which remained stable, because it had not risen during the price surge, and foreign-sourced sales were continuous. Therefore, the market was stable. Only small transactions were made by the Eastern Ocean syndicate, with 100 bags of Guandian sesame traded at a price of 8.15 yuan. Soybeans continued to be adjusted upward by 0.05 to 0.13 yuan, and sales to the Nanyang syndicate were quite frequent, with a total of 1,600 to 1,700 bags of various beans traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Maintains Clear and Firm Status Quo</h3>
<p>Since the currency reform, commodity prices have generally increased, but the silk industry is the only one that has not seen any changes. The rise in silk prices has already reached its peak, and there is a shortage of raw materials and goods. In addition to the market price remaining high, transactions have not been active. The market atmosphere is clear and firm, as it has always been. The opening of new prices of 900 yuan for white factory silk with 13 to 15 filaments is also as expected.</p>
<h3>Core-Extracted Zhenmei Tea Sales Brisk, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market was not desolate. European firms were particularly interested in core-extracted Zhenmei green tea, because market inventories were low and foreign demand was not weak. Although it was during the autumn racing season, market sentiment remained excited. Yihua, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu and other foreign firms purchased a total of over 1,100 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei-needle, and other green teas. The spot market price for core-extracted goods was 100 yuan, slightly higher than before. There were no other changes. For Pingshui pearl tea, supply could not meet demand, and merchants were sending personnel to the mountains to search for supplies to meet the needs of foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Metals: Reaction After the Sharp Rise in Metals</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metals trend showed signs of a reaction after the sharp rise. The reason was the impact of sluggish actual sales. Asking prices for all goods fell across the board. However, the downturn was not significant, so market sentiment was not very panicked. English steel plates (5 mm) opened at 7.50 yuan, down 0.05 yuan, with 170 to 180 dan traded, which were purchased by the Hankou and Yantai syndicates. Six-foot Dongbai iron was estimated at 1.04 yuan per sheet, also down 0.01 to 0.02 yuan from the previous day, with 4,000 sheets traded, which were discounted on this street and purchased by traders. For company iron, the asking price was as high as 30 yuan, but it was rumored that the actual price was 28.75 yuan, with deals being made, but transactions were not active. Black iron sheet and tinplate were traded by both domestic and foreign syndicates yesterday, but market prices had not changed. Thirty-five-pound thin tinplate for cigarette factories traded for 50 boxes at a price of 52 yuan. The market for lead was still strong due to a lack of spot goods, with an opening price of 20 yuan. It was rumored that many new shipments of ribbed steel bars had arrived, weakening market sentiment, and prices fell by 2 yuan, to 117 to 118 yuan per ton, with 30 to 40 tons traded. In addition, there were transactions in all types of metal products, but market prices had not increased or decreased.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Rise Is Set</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned flat. The association allocated 22 yuan for spot No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar. The transit goods that had previously been offered at 7.10 yuan but not traded were traded at 6.90 yuan yesterday, showing a slight softening. The Benchang Mianbai Zhenji No. 1 remained unchanged at 21.20 yuan. Transactions in the sugar industry cooperative's marked exchange decreased. A total of 890 bags of Huizhou medium-grade white sand were traded at 20.60 yuan, 1,000 bags of transit Dutch coarse white at 7 yuan, and 1,276 bags of Guangdong Mianbai No. 2 at 21.10 yuan. The next 100 bags of No. 2 Libai were offered at 20.65 yuan but were not traded. However, 103 bags of Wuyang No. 6 white sugar were traded at 18.20 yuan, and 44 bags of Wuyang No. 10 Mianchi were traded at 16.80 yuan. All the other East Red and East White sugars were offered at the original prices but were not traded. New shipments of Guangdong Chaoqing have been seen, and the trend is also flat and soft. The market may need to loosen slightly in the future.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Wood Ear Suddenly Scarce in Hankou</h3>
<p>According to news from Hankou regarding wood ear, after the implementation of the legal tender, market sentiment turned upward, and most sellers tightened their holdings and refused to sell, waiting for prices to rise. As a result, prices gradually increased. Goods from Hekou and Anyancheng were priced at 90 yuan, and Gucheng ear was priced at 86 yuan. Gao Kui ear was priced as high as 140 yuan. However, market inventories in Hankou were still ample, and it was difficult for prices in Shanghai to rise too high. Therefore, the overall trend may turn flat in the future.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Cottonseed Oil Rises by 1.50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cottonseed oil market situation had been stagnant for half a month. After the surge in soybean oil prices, factories were unwilling to sell. Traders on this street, seeing the recent activity in oil sales, were keen to add to their holdings. Yesterday, Dayou Factory sold 200 dan, with the price at 16 yuan, a significant increase of 1.50 yuan from before. However, due to slow sales and stable conditions, the market sentiment remained firm. Future developments will depend on sales and the movement of soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Survey: Tea Exports Decreased in September</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, tea exports in September that passed inspection for export totaled 26,636.66 quintals, a decrease of 7,047 quintals compared to the 33,683.97 quintals in the previous month. The decrease in green tea exports to Africa was the most significant. The quantities of Chinese tea exported in September and their destinations are listed in the table below.</p>

<h3>New Monetary Policy and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says; 'When things are exhausted, there is change, and with change, there is flow.' Matters of the world cannot escape this principle. Recently, the currency issue has reached a dead end. There are different opinions and diverse theories. The national goods industry has suffered deeply. Recently, the central financial authorities have issued a new monetary policy with swift and decisive measures, and issued a declaration, solemnly explaining that it is a necessary response to the demands of the times and an action that should be taken to reform finance. If it can be used appropriately and managed by capable people, it will not only have no adverse impact on the economy and finance, but also gradually eliminate the panic in China's economy and finance in the future. This policy is very worthy of the unanimous support of the people of the country. However, the new monetary policy has a great impact on China's national goods industry after its promulgation. On the eve of its promulgation, the national goods industry rushed to tell each other to stop shipping goods, believing that the soaring prices in the future would be an inevitable path, and it was also a necessary move to take precautions. As expected, the explicit order was issued early, and prices rose in the evening. The effect of the new monetary policy has the possibility of stimulating price increases. Price increases can greatly circulate domestic goods, giving stagnant industry and commerce the opportunity to develop smoothly. If it is not an excessive rise and avoids the monopoly and manipulation of speculators, it will be sufficient to promote the activity of the national goods industry and be beneficial to the economic recovery of the whole country. Mr. Song Ziwen said, 'Preventing speculation and attempts to excessively raise prices is currently a good opportunity for the government to quickly realize this far-reaching financial reform, and the welfare of the people of the whole country will increase as a result.' This is a very valuable speech. From the standpoint of national goods, the reporter expresses five humble opinions, hoping that the sages in the country will give practical guidance.</p>
<p>1.  The legal tender buys and sells foreign exchange without restriction, which has the greatest relationship with international trade. It is hoped that in the operation of foreign exchange business, unnecessary imported goods will be restricted to avoid depriving the original market of national goods.</p>
<p>2.  The government and society should promptly pay attention to the stability of the market. To stabilize foreign exchange, it is especially necessary to stabilize prices. Rumors made by petty people and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants should be strictly prohibited to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>3.  After the promulgation of the legal tender policy, international trade will inevitably become active, especially export trade, which will have significant progress. It is hoped that the national goods industry will improve manufacturing, refine products, and gain the trust of foreign merchants. In particular, it should study cost reduction and speed up production. Do not just work on raising prices.</p>
<p>4.  The legal tender policy is neither inflation nor a low currency policy, but a currency management policy. Therefore, the national goods industry should remain calm and deal with it calmly, be open and honest with the financial industry, seek smooth sales of products, and curb the outflow of money. In particular, it should take a long-term view and focus on the development of foreign trade, so that every point of reduction in foreign goods imported is one point of increase in sales of national goods, so as to revive the declining industrial and commercial enterprises in the country.</p>
<p>5.  The biggest pain of the national goods industry in recent years is the depletion of chips, the stagnation of funds, the depression of the rural economy, and the extreme depression of social purchasing power. Since the promulgation of the legal tender policy, not only can funds be supplied to meet the needs of legitimate enterprises in the national goods industry, but also the real estate mortgage law is revised to seek the vitality of real estate. If we are of one heart and one mind and follow the right track, the prosperity of industry and commerce can be predicted, and in the future, import and export trade can have the hope of balance. This is especially one of the most promising points for national goods.</p>
<h3>The Legal Tender Policy and the Future of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Recently, our Chinese government has done a very meaningful work and issued a very interesting and valuable order, which is the order issued by the Ministry of Finance on the implementation of the legal tender policy, which was published in the newspapers the day before yesterday (November 4). After carefully studying the Ministry of Finance's announcement, the reporter felt that this is not only of great importance to China's national economy and people's livelihood, social economy, and national lifeline, but also has a good impact on the future of national goods. Therefore, I think this is a very gratifying thing. From the standpoint of the national goods industry, I especially feel that this is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Ministry of Finance: "Since the drastic changes in silver prices, the phenomenon of domestic currency contraction has been very significant, resulting in the decline of industry and commerce, the depression of all industries, and the outflow of funds, which has greatly harmed the international balance of payments, and the national economy has become increasingly weak. All kinds of bad situations have arisen together. It is estimated that from July to October last year, in the middle of three and a half months, more than 200 million yuan of silver flowed out. If effective measures are not taken, then the domestic cash reserves? There is a danger of being exhausted by outflow!... etc. "After reading this announcement, we can see that the government's emergency promulgation of the legal tender policy is indeed in response to the needs of the environment and contains inherent, epoch-making significance.</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "The implementation of the legal tender policy is certainly closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Why does it also have a good impact on the future of national goods?" I think this friend's question is very interesting. We must know that after the implementation of the legal tender policy, the currency in circulation on the market is mostly paper money from the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China. Once silver dollars are encountered, they are collected at any time to prevent them from flowing out. In this way, all the cash in the country becomes the property of the state. The exchanges between Chinese people are completely centered on legal tender. If someone wants to smuggle silver out of the country privately, it is actually impossible. Even if they can deceive for a while, once it is found out, it will be confiscated in its entirety. Even if we take the purchase of foreign goods by Chinese people as an example, there was no problem in the past. However, after the implementation of the legal tender system, foreigners need cash transactions. How can they accept your paper money? Therefore, people who want to buy foreign goods naturally have no way, and the products of national goods have a chance to sell well. Isn't this a good thing? Promoting national goods has been shouted for several years, what national goods year, women's national goods year, have all been tried, but in the end, no good results can be obtained. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, it can be seen that the national goods industry can immediately get an active opportunity. How worthy is this of our joy! Therefore, I feel that the implementation of the legal tender policy has a close relationship with the future of national goods.</p>
<h3>Please Students Make a Final Effort to Complete the Work</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>In the past, the ancients said: "Do not say that you will not learn today, and there will be a tomorrow. Time flies, time will not come again"! These words are deeply encouraging to future generations! Time only rushes forward and never stops temporarily. Like this year, which is called the Student National Goods Year, it has passed quickly and is about to end! There are only a few dozen days left. May I ask how the students have done in promoting national goods in the past half a year or so? I am afraid it is also very ashamed to say! However, the time that has passed cannot be recovered. The most important thing is to seize the present. Please all the students in the country, in these short dozens of days, make a final effort to do the patriotic work of persuading the use of national goods.</p>
<p>Someone retorted to me: "You are too meaningless, the year is almost over, and you are still talking about this kind of nonsense!" I said: No! To put it humorously, take the 10,000-meter race as an analogy; it doesn't matter if you are behind when you run 6,000 to 7,000 meters. The most important thing is that when you are approaching 9,000 meters to the finish line, if you can courageously and quickly catch up, the championship still belongs to you! Therefore, everything is always based on the end result. Moreover, the weather is changing from cool to cold, and the people's demand for food, drink, and clothing is not as simple as in summer. They must purchase a large amount to meet their needs. This is the time when you students are working hard. On the one hand, persuade the people to use national goods consistently. On the other hand, organize investigation teams to carefully check national goods that are mixed with fake ones, and guide the people on the trademarks and forms of various national goods, so that the people can have a deep understanding and will not mistakenly purchase counterfeit products. If you do this diligently, even in a short period of time, I am sure you will get good results, build the final miracle, and complete all the work of the Student National Goods Year.</p>
<h3>Women and the Promotion of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yu Ke</p>
<p>A big word 'poverty' has thoroughly penetrated our entire China, but why is it so poor? Natural and man-made disasters in recent years are certainly one reason for poverty, but the biggest reason is still the underdevelopment of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Under the oppression of imperialist economic aggression, the agriculture, industry, and commerce of our country will only sooner or later embark on the road to death. If we want to get rid of this death, we can naturally only abolish the unequal treaties; however, there is another important task, which is to build up agriculture, industry, and commerce. Therefore, promoting national goods is a very important method.</p>
<p>Agriculture, industry, and commerce are interdependent. Without the development of industry, agriculture will not develop, and commerce will not develop. With the development of commerce, agriculture and industry will also develop. It has a causal chain; if we want to develop industry and commerce, we must first make our own industrial products sell well? Commerce becomes our own commerce, and the first step is to prevent Chinese money from flowing to foreign countries; if we want to prevent money from flowing abroad, we must vigorously promote national goods, exclude foreign goods, and make our own national goods sell well, so that agriculture, industry, and commerce can be revitalized, and the poverty of the country can be broken!</p>
<p>This is certain, especially women are most fond of using foreign goods; women like to be beautiful and love fashion. We only need to see that the foreign goods in various companies and stores are mostly women's supplies, and clothing and cosmetics are the largest. There are countless other things related to women. Suppose women can suddenly realize that everyone uses national goods, and foreign goods can almost be cut off and disappear. Female compatriots are one of the people of the country, and they have the rights to be enjoyed and the obligations to be fulfilled; in other words: women have the responsibility to promote national goods and save the country. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed, oppressed, and made a slave, there will be no distinction between men and women! But how do women promote national goods? Briefly describe it below:</p>
<p>A. Promote thrift and purchase national goods:</p>
<p>(1) All women's clothing, accessories, and supplies must be purchased with national goods; and widely persuade family and friends to purchase national goods in a practical way.</p>
<p>(2) Women's clothing should be simple and elegant, and all foreign costumes and excessively gorgeous and valuable items should be discarded.</p>
<p>B. Promote women's occupations:</p>
<p>(1) Promote women to engage in practical operations and not be leisurely and idle.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage women's home crafts.</p>
<p>(3) Organize women's supplies national goods consumer cooperatives.</p>
<p>C. Educate children to develop the habit of purchasing national goods:</p>
<p>(1) Children's toys should be purchased with national goods.</p>
<p>(2) Children should be instilled with knowledge of patriotism and purchasing national goods.</p>
<h3>Transforming Psychology</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guanzhu</p>
<p>In recent years, many things in "foreign goods" are now available in "national goods." Moreover, some "national goods" are even better than "foreign goods," and the price is sometimes cheaper than "foreign goods." However, most Chinese people still like to use "foreign goods" and do not like to use "national goods!" Someone asked me: What is the reason for this? I said: This is a kind of psychology, playing tricks there!</p>
<p>Because, in everyone's mind, they think that "foreign goods" are good and good, even if the price is expensive, they will buy it. As for "national goods," it always seems to be crude and unbearable, even if the price is cheap and the quality is good, they are regarded as worthless! Alas! Everyone has this kind of psychology, how can "national goods" raise their heads?</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to use the four words "transforming psychology" as the title of this article. The intention is nothing more than to hope that Chinese people will quickly transform this psychology of loving "foreign goods" and not loving "national goods" from now on. To put it bluntly, it is to hope that everyone will quickly treat "national goods" with the psychology of treating "foreign goods." If everyone can really do this, "foreign goods" will definitely fall without being attacked, and "national goods" can raise their heads. If you don't believe me, everyone may as well try it.</p>
<h3>On the Training of Shop Assistants</h3>
<p>— Ye Yiyi</p>
<p>—The training of shop assistants is closely related to the sales of national goods—</p>
<p>I have the following fragments of facts as the motivation for writing this article:</p>
<p>Because the school has not been in session for a long time, and various school supplies are not yet fully prepared, therefore, taking advantage of the weekend holidays, I went outside to buy some things. First, I ran to Simma Road, to a bookstore that sells slogan charts. I saw several shop assistants chatting idly. They were wearing beautiful and foreign clothes, and they didn't seem to care about business. After I went in, I looked at the charts and asked about the price; but the upper bodies of several shop assistants were lying on the glass panel and chatting again. When I saw the situation was like this, and the price was also very expensive, I walked out. Along Simma Road to the west, I arrived at Fujian Road and stepped into a paper shop. I wanted to buy some maobian paper to ask my children to bind their own notebooks for practicing writing; but when I asked him the price, a phone call came to the shop assistant, so he left me, this customer, aside and went away; I asked another shop assistant, but the other shop assistant ignored me and turned his head away, probably because this business was not taken by him, so it didn't matter: I waited for more than a quarter of an hour before I bought the paper and went back. After passing through Penglai Market, I went to a shop to buy a Great Wall brand thermos. I went in and looked at several styles. When I was asking about the price, several female customers came. The shop assistant saw that I was asking about the price, maybe it was too troublesome and annoying, so he asked me arrogantly: "Hey! Do you want to buy it or not?" I didn't get angry when I heard this question. I said leisurely: "Of course! I want to buy it. Maybe something happened to your husband? Then, you can ask another shop assistant to replace you!" He was silent, so I chose one for one and a half yuan, gave him the money, took an invoice without a stamp, and left.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, I personally feel that the training of shop assistants is indeed a very important issue that deserves attention. Because this issue affects the sales of national goods, its relationship is really important and big, and very close. If the training of shop assistants is poor, on the surface, it is certainly a loss for the boss and shareholders; but in reality, it is also a direct loss for national goods and industrial products. Conversely, if the shop assistant's attitude is sincere, his language is kind, his clothing is simple, and his manners are appropriate, the customer will naturally be satisfied and buy, and come again next time after leaving; in this way, the development of business can be expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, the training of shop assistants has a very deep relationship with the sales of national goods; therefore, the training of shop assistants is indeed an issue that should be paid attention to by colleagues in the national goods industry. Now I will briefly write down a few goals of training based on my limited knowledge:</p>
<p>(1) The attitude should be sincere. A shop assistant's attitude is very important to customers; a sincere attitude can make customers feel so moved that they feel like it is very unreasonable not to buy something. Conversely, if the attitude is arrogant, then the customer will look at it and leave, because it can also be bought elsewhere.</p>
<p>(2) The language should be fluent. If the language is not fluent, it is often offensive to customers. For example, when a customer comes, the shop assistant must try his best to introduce the national goods and very politely explain its advantages.</p>
<p>(3) The manners should be respectful. A customer's visit is a good phenomenon, so you should treat him with very respectful manners; if you ignore him and let him look at it, that would be terrible. When he comes, you should treat him very respectfully. You must know that being polite is not a shameless thing!</p>
<p>(4) The clothing should be simple. At first glance, a shop assistant's clothing seems unimportant; in reality, it should also be simple. Because being covered in imported goods is not a model shop assistant.</p>
<p>Whether the above four points are appropriate or not, I hope that readers will give me some pointers.</p>
<h3>National Goods Small Toys</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>I introduced the clay sculptures of Huishan as national goods small toys the day before yesterday; recently, I traveled to Suzhou and found something worth introducing, which is the wooden toys produced in Mudu Town.</p>
<p>Mudu Town is more than 20 miles away from Suzhou City. There are good scenery such as Lingyan Mountain and Tianping Mountain, so there are quite a few people who go to play. In the past, traveling by boat took half a day to go back and forth. Now there are highways, and public buses can arrive in less than an hour, so it is even more lively. Since I had already arrived in Suzhou, I naturally went to enjoy it. The red trees on the mountainside and the wildflowers on both banks have a kind of scenery, which is not related to this article, so there is no need to describe it in detail. In Lingyan Mountain and Tianping Mountain, I found many villagers selling some wooden small toys, which suddenly moved my heart. These wooden toys, when I was a child, were also popular all over the country with the big A Fu of Wuxi: I also liked to play with them when I was a child. Unexpectedly, they are now defeated by imported toys and hiding at the foot of the mountain, only for people who visit the mountain to buy as souvenirs. Do you think it is pitiful or not! I looked at its types and manufacturing methods again, and it was much more advanced than when I was a child. The types include wooden eggs, wooden bullets, candlesticks, teacups, wine glasses, rice bowls, vases, pen holders, jars, small bowls, etc., and the styles are also small and exquisite, and the colors are smooth and elegant. If they were placed in the windows of large companies, they would definitely be able to sell at a good price, but unfortunately they fell into the hands of the villagers, and the highest price is less than five cents a piece. Do you think it is miserable or not!</p>
<p>I spent four dimes from an old hawker and bought more than a dozen pieces, and incidentally asked him about his manufacturing method. He said: "The raw materials for this kind of woodenware are made of hard elm wood. Because the large pieces of elm wood have already been made into household utensils, the sawed-off edges and corners have no use, so we buy them by the pound, and first dry them in the sun, because the things made of wet wood will split when they are dry, then all the previous efforts will be abandoned and it will be difficult to change money: After the wood is dried, draw the shape with an ink line, and use a knife to chisel it into a rough blank: then put it on a wood lathe and it will be smooth and delicate! If you want the color to be oily and moist, then apply a layer of cooked oil. Although the capital to make these things is not large, the effort is very costly." After listening to him, I thought that what kind of Chinese handicraft products are not like this! To improve production, we must first pay attention to machinery.</p>
<p>Back in Shanghai, I gave these small wooden objects to relatives and friends, and everyone praised them, so I wrote this article to promote and introduce them.</p>
<h3>First-Rank Lady</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>"First-Rank Lady" This is an honorary title of the imperial era, only prime ministers and ministers can receive this title. Although there is no imperial title now, the title "lady" is very popular.</p>
<p>Judging grades by official ranks is autocratic and unreasonable; however, dividing high and low by character is worthy of people's agreement. For example, calling Mr. Gu's wife "First-Rank Lady" is appropriate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu has considerable knowledge and is good at cooking and sewing. Since she married Mr. Gu, she has been a good help to Mr. Gu. She helps her husband handle household chores; whether it is guests who have been to her house or her neighbors, they all praise her for her wisdom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu's appearance is also very beautiful. According to her, she pays attention to the beauty of her appearance and also takes care of the beauty of her heart, because the heart and the appearance are related. As for the cosmetics she uses, they are also very simple, only two or three kinds, and they are all national goods. She often says to people that it is our duty to promote national goods, let alone this kind of product is beautiful in quality and cheap in price.</p>
<p>Like Mrs. Gu, a woman with knowledge, skills, virtue, and a patriotic spirit, we call her First-Rank Lady. Who says it is inappropriate?</p>

<h3>The Invention of Synthetic Gasoline</h3>
<p>— Xiang Xian</p>
<p>In the 20th century world, gasoline is a very important driving force, but all kinds of gasoline used in our country rely on imports. According to the customs report book of the 22nd year, the total number of gasoline imports was 21,329,000 yuan, and the total amount of gasoline imports in the 23rd year was 19,312,000 yuan. This year, the development of highways is progressing very actively, and the transportation vehicles that are related to it will of course be purchased in large quantities, then the consumption of gasoline should exceed the previous amount. How can we imagine going on like this? The invention of self-made gasoline by Chinese people is really a matter of urgency. Recently, Mr. Xu Boyun, director of the research department of Hangzhou Minsheng Manufacturing Plant, invented a kind of synthetic gasoline, which has been tested by the aviation school. The results are excellent and are a great contribution to the Chinese people, which is of great importance to the future of the nation. Now I will write down the process of his invention to tell the readers, hoping that everyone will pay deep attention to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Boyun is from Shangyu, Zhejiang, and is 29 years old this year. He studied medicine at Chiba Medical University in Japan and obtained a bachelor's degree. He returned to China in the 21st year of the Republic of China and served as the director of the research department of Minsheng Plant. He is always diligent in the laboratory, engaged in chemical experiments. He has also invented pharmaceutical products such as Daitanling and Ximeiling. This time, the invention of synthetic gasoline was indeed discovered accidentally and unintentionally. It was discovered occasionally from a special type of mineral soil in the hands of a villager, so he engaged in researching its properties and effects, so he learned that this type of mineral soil has a special and good effect in chemistry. That is, when it is catalytically decomposed, it produces very little gas and produces a large amount of oil tar, which is light yellow in color and has fluorescence, which is better than the dark brown oil tar obtained by dry distillation of oil. Therefore, he refined it with the ordinary method of refining gasoline, and then checked its various chemical and physical properties and conditions, and proved that the gasoline refined in this way has the same properties as natural gasoline. Therefore, with the commendation and support of Principal Zhou of the Central Aviation School and Director Zeng of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, it was tested on a 120-horsepower aircraft engine on December 15 last year. The test results were better than natural gasoline. This unexpected harvest cannot be regarded as a great contribution, not to mention that domestic gasoline is an urgent need at present. I earnestly hope that the government authorities and the general public will promote and assist it, so that we can release a ray of light for the future of Chinese industry!</p>

<h3>Publishing and the Military</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingwen</p>
<p>Publishing and the military, in our China, are as distant as the North and South Poles.</p>
<p>Publishers do business, believing that libraries and schools are their major clients; they print books for professors, students, and general intellectuals. As for soldiers, everyone generally believes that they don't need books besides holding guns. As for ordinary soldiers, they are not only ignored by publishers, but also, in fact, have been excluded from the circle of culture since ancient times. This traditional separation has led to the backwardness of the Chinese military, making ordinary soldiers extremely ignorant and crude. Obviously, this is due to the lack of cultural education in the military. However, the reason for this lack is not that people in the barracks dislike reading or are averse to cultural education; rather, it is that Chinese scholar-officials have historically held the prejudice that military men only need to learn skills and do not need to understand literature. Therefore, people proficient in both literary and military arts were very rare in the past, and the widespread illiteracy in the military is still a very common phenomenon today.</p>
<p>However, the world is evolving. The last century was the 20th century. The boundaries between literary and military affairs have been destroyed by the fierce winds of science and technology. Soldiers using modern weapons must not only arm their hands and bodies, but also fully arm their minds.</p>
<p>For example, the strength and civilization of Europe, America, and Japan are obviously due to the close relationship between publishing and the military. It is said that soldiers' reading materials published in Japan each year account for more than 20% of the total number of publications in the country. Although there are no statistics on the number of pamphlets on military affairs, politics, and economics compiled for soldiers, there are more than forty types of popular magazines for the military alone. In countries such as England and France, many literary figures write works depicting war and military life, and their main target audience is in the barracks. Many soldiers are ardent supporters of Remarque, Rousseau, and Barbusse, because their works depict the inner world and soul of soldiers. And now, in countries such as Germany and Italy, writers are also ordered to write works dedicated to soldiers, which are intended to encourage them—to glorify war or promote militarism. As for countries like Soviet Russia, the publishing industry is even printing soldiers' reading materials on a planned and large scale. Their published "Red Army Library" is indeed quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Looking back at our China, the situation is completely different. The publishing industry provides almost no assistance to the cultural education of the military. As a result, suitable reading materials for soldiers are extremely rare. Of course, one or two writers who were once young masters or young ladies have written some military diaries, but those are ultimately not understandable to soldiers. It must be known that the only thing that ordinary Chinese soldiers read now is a kind of "Soldier's Daily Lessons." Naturally, this cannot satisfy the soldiers' intellectual desires. But in fact, I have often seen many soldiers secretly reading novels and songbooks on duty. This shows that although most Chinese soldiers are illiterate, everyone has a burning desire for knowledge. If the Chinese publishing industry can imitate the methods of Japanese bookstores and systematically compile several interesting soldiers' reading materials, including basic military textbooks on various military, political, economic, geographical, and natural sciences, I think the sales would definitely be good.</p>
<p>Moreover, because the Chinese military has indeed undergone some reorganization in recent years, and there has been considerable progress in discipline and organization, when forming a national defense force in the future, cultural education will naturally be indispensable. The authorities are now actively carrying out enlightenment education in the military, so objectively, there is a great need for assistance from the publishing industry. This assistance is undoubtedly a very glorious and sacred task for the Chinese publishing industry. Moreover, the publishing industry is currently mired in an atmosphere of recession, suffering from the economic panic. If the publishing industry can truly use part of the financial and human resources used to reprint large numbers of ancient books to assist the cultural education cause in the military, then this would not only be a loyal service to the country, but also open up a new field for the publishing industry itself.</p>
<p>This publication welcomes submissions. Please send them to the Publishing Business Committee of the China Cultural Construction Association at No. 500 Lafayette Road, Shanghai. After publication, we will pay three to four yuan per thousand words.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Literary Translation</h3>
<p>— Dezhong</p>
<p>Since the so-called "Eastern Advance of Western Culture," China's seals were opened. European and American guns not only opened China's ports and fortresses, but also opened the eyes of the Chinese people. Everyone opened their eyes to see that foreign countries were not as barbaric and backward as they had imagined, and that there were some things we should learn.</p>
<p>What the eyes could see were only "sound, light, electricity, and chemistry" and "strong ships and powerful guns." Foreign countries only had these material things that we should learn. Thus, the slogan "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical use" was born.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the field of literature, there was also a corresponding expression, which was Lin Shu's translations. In the preface to his translation of Haggard's "Allan Quatermain," he said:</p>
<p>"Everywhere it is guided by Lobag as the thread, how is it not very similar to my Sima Qian? ... Observing his focus, he must describe Lobag as the key to the entire chapter, which is the writing method of Sima Qian's Biography of Dawan."</p>
<p>Also, in the preface to his translation of Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop," he said:</p>
<p>"I have always said that in ancient texts, narrating everyday and plain matters is the most difficult to write. In Sima Qian's Biographies of the Empresses' Relatives, the description of Bao Changjun said, 'My sister bid me farewell in an inn, begged to wash me, fed me, and then left.' What makes people feel sad is only these few words. ... After all, Sima Qian does not often use this kind of writing, because Sima Qian's book is not specifically about everyday matters. Now Dickens specializes in everyday language, and specializes in writing about the everyday affairs of the lower classes of society, which makes using ink even more difficult."</p>
<p>This very clearly uses "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical use" as a banner. Therefore, the reason for translation is still because the original work has places that "resemble my Sima Qian," or that "Sima Qian rarely uses this kind of writing." At that time, this kind of influence spread to various magazines and newspapers, and almost all translations were based on this kind of thought.</p>
<p>The concept of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical use" was eliminated during the May Fourth Movement. In literary translation, it also ushered in a long-term improvement at the same time. First, translation focused on the style of the original work, no longer forcibly incorporating anything from China. Second, in order to maintain the style of the original work, vernacular Chinese was used, and the translation was absolutely faithful.</p>
<p>After this, people were indeed able to work hard according to this new improvement in translation, but apart from a few magazines and translators who could focus on a certain aspect, most translations were still unsystematic and without a purpose. Zheng Zhenduo said:</p>
<p>"We have been introducing European and American literature for thirty or forty years, but we have never had a planned introduction; often, we just grab a book and translate it, or we are constrained by popular ideas, and we often spend a lot of effort translating second- or third-rate works. (World Literature Series)"</p>
<p>These words are a critique of translation over the past three or four decades, and can represent a new understanding of the entire Chinese translation industry.</p>
<p>Accompanied by this kind of understanding, from the second half of last year to the first half of this year, there were three important publications.</p>
<p>The first is "Translation."</p>
<p>In the "Preface" of "Translation," there was no flaunting of any great goals or plans, only saying:</p>
<p>"It is not intended to raise the banner of 'reviving translation'—there is no ambition for this kind of high-pitched call, but just to have a few like-minded people study each other and print it out for people who like to read translations to use as reference."</p>
<p>But if we try to flip through the content of this publication, we can see many works by modern and even contemporary writers, realist or anti-social writers, and works by weak and small peoples.</p>
<p>Although they did not boast much, the content of the publication tells us that it is not just "a few like-minded people studying each other casually."</p>
<p>The second is "World Literature."</p>
<p>In the "Inaugural Statement" of "World Literature," it says:</p>
<p>"In modern Chinese literature, the generalization of form and language is a major problem. In addition, incorporating content into the territory of world literature to establish the direction of Chinese literature, deepen emotions, and enrich appearances is also a major problem. Especially in terms of content, Chinese literature, like other Chinese problems, must be involved in the surging waves of the world to have a considerable solution." It also says:</p>
<p>"This publication is born to strive to fulfill one percent of the thousands of responsibilities in the construction of new literature. Introduce the literature of various countries, estimate its value to world literature, that is, new literature; publish works that can be used in form or content; explore the path of Chinese literature with an absolutely objective attitude. At all times, we hope that this kind of purpose can form a new literary view in China, arousing the attention of the people to new literature."</p>
<p>From the content of this publication, we can see that most of it also pays attention to the works of modern and contemporary writers, but the battle line is not as neat as "Translation," especially in the "Poetry" section.</p>
<p>The previous two publications were all about introducing foreign literature. There is also a third type that publishes half Chinese classics and half foreign works, namely the third: "World Library."</p>
<p>In the "Inaugural Declaration" of "World Library," it says:</p>
<p>"The introduction and recitation of world literary masterpieces is the greatest task (or right) and joy of the people of our time." It also says:</p>
<p>"Our work is to introduce and organize in a planned way, presenting world literary masterpieces to the general readers in the most convenient way."</p>
<p>Judging from the several volumes of "World Library" that have been published, apart from Gogol's "Dead Souls," Cervantes' "Don Quixote," and a few translations by Gorky and Balzac that are needed by modern readers, some translations seem to be fillers, which can only be used as literary history references, and some of them are not even first-rate works. Of course, the publication of "World Library" is intended to introduce ancient and modern masterpieces from abroad and publish Chinese classics as literary history references, and it seems that the needs of the general readers have been completely ignored. But it is too inconvenient for readers to buy so many books that include a lot of unnecessary things in order to read a few articles.</p>
<p>Overall, in the past year, literary translation has indeed had a trend of revival. And the purpose of literary translation is also very different from the past. To sum it up, it can be roughly divided into three aspects: First, at this time, new Chinese literature rarely has very substantial works appearing, and readers have few opportunities to come into contact with foreign literature, so translating foreign literary works to meet these needs of readers is an urgent task. Second, introducing the styles of foreign literary works is for the reference and learning of Chinese authors. Third, literature is universal, and in order to make it a part of world literature, it is necessary to have an understanding of foreign literature.</p>
<p>Although there is now such a progressive understanding and active effort in literary translation, we cannot be too optimistic about it. Many attacks on translation have not stopped for a single day, and the ability of readers to develop interest and need for translated works is still not very widespread.</p>
<p>Now "Translation" has already ceased publication. And according to the "Qingguang" in the "Shishi Xinbao," there are also rumors that "World Literature" will also cease publication. Now there is only one "World Library" that is expensive and not very substantial, and has already been delayed by one issue.</p>
<h3>Introducing Three Interesting Mathematics Books</h3>
<p>— Qizhong</p>
<p>There is an annoying limerick about mathematics that has been passed down from the European Middle Ages, which roughly says: "Multiplication is annoying, division is also annoying, ratios make people feel helpless, and calculations make people go crazy." Indeed, most people not only don't find mathematics interesting, but also feel a headache when they see it, so the grades of general students are always the worst in mathematics. Even for me personally, more than ten years ago in school, when I encountered a mathematics exam, I always ate tangyuan (a type of dessert, meaning I failed). The mathematics teacher would specially give me twenty points for his own face, and I would accept it without hesitation. There are many people like me in reality, and even if there are differences, they are not very different, so the grades of general students are relatively the worst in mathematics.</p>
<p>Why do most students not like mathematics? Needless to say, this is entirely a matter of interest. The first thing in pursuing any knowledge is to have interest. Without interest, there will never be any achievements. Even with travel, if you are interested in traveling, then even if you climb mountains and wade through water, sweating all over and panting non-stop, you will still feel very happy and soon be able to achieve the goal of "Standing alone on the top of the mountain, I am the peak." On the contrary, for people who have no interest in traveling, forcing them to climb mountains and wade through water will only make them feel pain. Therefore, the most important thing in pursuing knowledge is interest. Because mathematics is a dry and tasteless subject, the grades of general students are also the worst.</p>
<p>Many people think that learning mathematics is only for daily application, but the mathematics learned in schools now completely exceeds daily application. Because it is not suitable for daily application, they feel more and more of a headache when they see dry and abstract mathematics, and their grades become more and more inferior. One day, Euclid's student asked Euclid, "What is the benefit of learning such difficult things?" This question can be said to be generally held by students now for the subject of mathematics, especially a group of middle school students. However, pursuing knowledge is not just for current use. Euclid, in response to his student's question, took out three copper coins from his pocket and replied, "Do you think getting these three copper coins is better than acquiring knowledge?" We must know that mathematics is the foundation for studying science, and we must not be greedy for the three copper coins in front of us and abandon the foundation of science. Therefore, we must not be unenthusiastic about learning mathematics because the mathematics learned in schools is not suitable for daily application.</p>
<p>Most people know the importance of studying science, and most people also know that mathematics is the foundation for studying science. However, knowing the importance of this subject, everyone has to feel a headache for this important subject. Therefore, teachers who teach mathematics must find materials from new aspects to make dry and tasteless things into fresh and interesting materials. This is like bitter medicine, which no one likes to take. Doctors must find a way to infiltrate a sweet taste so that people don't realize they are taking the same medicine. However, so-called textbooks are mostly dry and tasteless things, so what I am introducing here is not textbooks, but mathematics books for general reading. That is, the three books published by Kaiming Bookstore written by Mr. Liu Xunyu: "The Garden of Mathematics" (half a dollar), "Mathematical Interest" (eight jiao), and the "Mathematics and Genius" (six jiao) published in the Middle School Student Magazine.</p>
<p>These three books completely use a rich and interesting style to explain the principles of mathematics, so that readers feel like they are reading an interesting novel, like they are walking into a beautiful garden, making them reluctant to leave. "The Garden of Mathematics" is a relatively systematic explanation of the principles of arithmetic: "Mathematical Interest" is a mathematical article picked up everywhere in daily life: "Mathematics and Genius" is a collection of mathematical articles written by several mathematics experts in interesting language, and the content is similar to "Mathematical Interest." Let's take a look at these topics to see if they are interesting: "Stacking Arhats," "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea," "Han Xin Counting Soldiers," "Old Man Wang's Soup Dumplings," "If I Had Twelve Fingers"... This is just a part of the topics. There are a total of thirty-nine articles in the three books. After reading these thirty-nine interesting articles, people who feel annoyed by mathematics will definitely develop a great interest in mathematics. Mr. Feng Zikai said: "I have never tasted the interest of mathematics, and I have never visited the world of mathematics, which is a loss." I feel that Mr. Feng's words clearly expressed what was in my heart, and I think there must be many people who feel the same as me!</p>
<p>I don't want to advertise for Kaiming Bookstore and make readers rashly buy these three books. I really hope that readers may first go to the library to borrow these three books—or only borrow one if they can't borrow three—to read. If you read it and it is indeed interesting, then it is not too late to buy it; because the bookstore will never increase the price of the book because the cost of living is becoming more and more expensive day by day.</p>
<p>Comrades who do not feel interested in mathematics (because I am not good at mathematics, and I might as well call people who are like me comrades), please pay attention to my words. If you can arouse your mathematical taste from these three books, it is not only the achievement of the author, but also the good fortune of the comrades!</p>

<h3>Telephone Price Increase and Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>The Shanghai market has been in a depression in all industries, and has become more and more profound since the Shanghai War (the process and reasons cannot be fully explained in this short article of about a thousand words, so I will omit it for now). Up to now, the four words "economic panic" have not only become a household name, but have also become the slogans of "big sales" and "big bargains." The depth of the panic has been exposed like a patient in the third stage of lung disease, and cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>Accompanying this very blatant form is inevitably the rising call for rent reduction, because for ordinary shops with a monthly business of only one thousand yuan or so, their rent is almost one hundred yuan. Calculated at a profit of 3%, a shop's monthly profit is only about three hundred yuan, and after deducting rent, employee salaries, and other daily expenses, what is the net profit? It has become a problem. Moreover, after the Shanghai War, the business of general shops has to be discounted by at least half, so under the business after the discount, can they afford such high rents? It is already self-evident. The call for rent reduction is very reasonable, and to revive Shanghai and restore it to its previous prosperity, it is necessary to implement rent reduction.</p>
<p>However, after two years of the call for rent reduction, apart from a small number of shops and residents enjoying preferential treatment of 20% or 10% off, the majority are still "nephews holding lanterns"—as usual.</p>
<p>While this rent reduction issue has not yet been resolved, the telephone is about to increase its price according to the new pricing, charging by the number of calls.</p>
<p>In addition to expensive rent, at this time of economic downturn, can citizens still afford even more expensive telephone bills? There is no need for the author to explain, the citizens who are directly affected understand it even better.</p>
<p>However, the fact that rent has not been reduced but telephone bills are increasing is ironclad. Moreover, this ironclad fact will be implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>Although rent reduction is being petitioned to the Sixth Plenary Session, and the telephone price increase is being continuously opposed, according to the Nanjing Road Citizens' Federation, they would rather cut off the telephone lines of the telephone bureau when necessary. However, it is inevitable that the efforts of a single organization will not have good results because they are isolated and weak, and the telephone company authorities are going their own way and insisting to the end.</p>
<p>So, is it to add more weight to a burden that is already suffocating?</p>
<p>Of course not. In order to revive Shanghai, and even more to fight for survival, rent reduction and opposition to the telephone bill increase are not only a matter of rising up in anger and shouting for a while. We must also resolutely take concerted action to implement our demands.</p>
<p>We know that seeking individual gains and demanding as individual units, besides being exploited in an orderly manner, will lead to individual bankruptcy. As a result, apart from being given local anesthesia and temporarily alleviating pain, there will be nothing gained, and it will naturally be even more different from the so-called revival of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fifty Dollars</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The dim sunlight climbed over the "Five Sons Pass the Examination" roof ridge, shining on the west-facing windows of these five main rooms. Facing south from the main rooms was a wide courtyard, with two magnolia and osmanthus trees planted in the left and right corners, guarding the main rooms in their shade like two gatekeepers. Facing the main rooms was a high wall, taller than the main building, so passersby outside the wall could not see the "Five Sons Pass the Examination" roof ridge; only bursts of osmanthus fragrance wafted out from the wall, making them cast greedy glances at the top of the high wall.</p>
<p>It was past four in the afternoon, and three or five crows circled the tops of the magnolia trees, but there was still no sound from the main rooms, as if a deserted building was shrouded in deadly silence. The owner of the house was a local gentry, a large landowner, who was being woken from a good dream by his concubine. He—generally called Master Hu, although only a forty-year-old middle-aged man—turned over in his silk quilt, stretched out his yellowish fingers and rubbed his eyes, which were blurred with sleep. He saw his concubine standing in front of the bed with a stern face (because she had called him more than a dozen times, but Master Hu always covered his head with the quilt. Master Hu himself understood this temper; nothing important could wake him up before he was fully awake). He quickly forced an ugly smile and tried to pull the concubine over. But the concubine was like a stone pillar, not at all like she usually was, weakly and</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>easily losing her footing and throwing her upper body into Master Hu's arms with a giggle. Now she tightened her face and slapped away Master Hu's outstretched hand, genuinely angry:</p>
<p>"You can't wake up from your sleep, that Gao...died because of you, see if you..."</p>
<p>She turned her back and slumped into the sofa chair in front of the bed. Master Hu immediately furrowed his bushy eyebrows, but he knew that this was his concubine's jealousy. The day he brought Gao Agen's woman here, they quarreled all night. A jade Buddha more than two feet tall was smashed to pieces by the concubine. Only after he begged and pleaded a thousand times did she calm down. Gao Agen's woman was truly something: she let her hair down, tore her clothes, and tried to kill herself. Even Aunt Liu's silver tongue, which could make the dead speak, was useless! But the concubine was happy instead. She said to Master Hu: "What's so good about that woman? These days, she looks even less like a person. Just let her go back. I heard that Agen had a good early rice harvest. Just bring his grain here!" Master Hu smiled, knowing that the woman, after two days without food, had changed her mind somewhat. He just needed to deceive his concubine's eyes, play with her a bit, and then let her go home; and he wasn't afraid that Agen would welsh on the ninety dollars. Last night, Master Hu secretly went to the secret chamber. The woman was sitting quietly on the bed eating. Aunt Liu whispered in his ear: "There will be a way out in the next two days, Master Hu, don't come. If it goes wrong, Aunt Liu can't bear the responsibility!" She smiled flatteringly and pushed Master Hu out.</p>
<p>Master Hu sat up, leaning against the pillow. He peeked at his concubine's movements through the silk gauze curtain. The concubine had her back to the curtain, and Master Hu knew who had leaked the news about her angry appearance—that woman must have been persuaded by Aunt Liu. Thinking of this, Master Hu's heart bloomed, but he coughed and said softly:</p>
<p>"Why be angry? I don't intend to marry her, just play with her for a while..."</p>
<p>"Hmph!" The concubine jumped up from the sofa: "Don't dream! Who wants to eat this vinegar? Agen hanged himself, and your darling bailiff has been waiting outside the door for more than two hours!" The concubine finally shouted.</p>
<p>Only then did Master Hu jump up. "Is this really the case? Where's A'er?" He grabbed a long robe from the corner of the bed and stepped down.</p>
<p>A'er slipped in from outside the door. He lowered his head, drooped his hands, and didn't know where Master Hu was standing, speaking to the bed: "Master Hu, I went to Agen's house as instructed. He said he would definitely return the fifty dollars from selling the grain and begged me to say good words to the master to let his wife go back. As the master instructed, I couldn't agree... He hanged himself last night..."</p>
<p>"Bastard! Bastard!" Master Hu spun around in the room in his slippers. "You can't even handle this little thing, and you still have the nerve to see me! What happens next? Speak! Speak!"</p>
<p>"They've already reported it to the bureau..." A'er took a few steps back, as if afraid that Master Hu would hit him.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Master Hu stopped abruptly, his broad eyebrows furrowed, his eyes seemingly spitting sparks. He looked at the concubine standing in front of the bed with her head held high, while A'er retreated to the threshold. Master Hu struck his palm with his fist. "Bastard! Bastard, what are you still standing there for? Quickly take my card to the bureau!" He said to the concubine, "Also, give A'er another fifty dollars. Tell the bureau chief that I'll be there right away!"</p>
<p>"We haven't received the fifty dollars, and we have to spend another fifty dollars?" The concubine sneered.</p>
<p>"What are you saying?!" Master Hu stomped on the floor. "Bastard! Bastard!"</p>
<h3>Small Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Green Leaves</p>
<p>— Impressions of an Ancient City</p>
<p>On the gray street, only the small teahouse clearly punctuated the gray, lonely atmosphere; a sign painted with golden yellow paint peeled off in patches of gray, its color and tone distinctly gray and lonely.</p>
<p>On one side, water was being sold, the gray wall and gray stove basking in the bright sunlight. Usually, one or two women and children, carrying copper kettles, would come to buy water. As the copper coins clinked lonesomely in the bamboo container, a tall man, always wearing the same ordinary expression, would scoop a kettle of hot water for them and silently put the ladle away. He stood listlessly by the stove, listening to the interesting gossip of the townspeople, or adding some coal to the stove. Sometimes, when he met the women, he would also knowingly strike up a conversation and flirt with them.</p>
<p>On that gray pillar, a faded red strip of paper was pasted, on which the words "Hairdressing" were written in large, red-filled characters. Sometimes, we could see the red strip of paper fluttering quietly in the wind; beneath it was a young lad with a white cloth skirt tied around his chest, smeared with many streaks of snot, straight and crooked—he was a barber. He was a lonely one, wasn't he? We could see his pair of eyes stealthily sizing up the beauty of the woman buying water.</p>
<p>The mouths and eyes of many of the teahouse's patrons were perhaps forever gray and lonely; they added gray material and gray loneliness to the small teahouse. Each of them longed for the beauty of Jiangnan and the famous city of Shanghai, harboring in the depths of their hearts this kind of beautiful gold mine, and base hopes.</p>
<p>Most of the customers in this teahouse were small merchants of the "chicken-stealing-for-feathers" variety, and there were also one or two vagrants and crude, tall rickshaw pullers. Every day, they let gray and lonely years slip away in the gray and lonely small teahouse. They talked about women's jokes and town gossip—when talking about women interestingly, they would laugh basely. Sometimes, when they heard town gossip that was as absurd as a myth, everyone would ask and talk about it with concern, the crude laughter of the rickshaw pullers punctuating the surroundings.</p>
<p>Here, the rickshaw pullers were the most straightforward and crude; they would never hide an interesting word in their hearts; they would say in low, soft voices the interesting stories of their women, adding to the laughter. In their—the rickshaw pullers'—hearts, there was only a glimmer of warm comfort.</p>
<p>Every day, they bore their resentment, growing up in the gray world and the gray ancient city. One vagrant would say that the gray loneliness of this ancient city would eat away at their lives and their spirits, so they all longed for the beautiful watery towns of distant Jiangnan and the bustling Shanghai. Only this was their most colorful, rich, and complex topic of conversation. They envied the luxury of Shanghai, and at the same time hoped to visit Shanghai or Jiangnan for half a year. In a gray life, people need a little bit of warmth.</p>
<p>Every day, they talked about the sights of Shanghai, and that knowledgeable, flat-faced, short waiter would agree in a low voice, his wide eyes longing for Shanghai. At dusk, customers would stream out onto the gray streets and alleys, returning to their gray homes. In the small teahouse, only the lonely waiter was left, tidying up the messy tea trays on the tables, and the boiling water on the stove hissed in loneliness.</p>
<h3>The Temptation of Purple Grapes</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>This is a small, rustic garden, with poplars, maple trees, ginkgos, secluded paths paved with green stones, and grape trellises made of pine branches. Every day, when a soft ray of late autumn sunset shines on the vermillion railing of the third floor of the Wen Kui Pavilion, I would have a collection of poetry, a few mild cigarettes, and a leisurely mood, strolling by the small pond filled with wild vegetables and dodder vines.</p>
<p>Here, I am not subjected to the temptation of lust or the threat of wealth. I can indulge in all private fantasies and freely conjure up some past memories, whether sweet, bitter, or as bitter as coptis, I always consider it a kind of stimulation, letting my numb life tremble once. Occasionally, I can also lean against the cool rocks of the artificial hill and sing a mournful tune. The autumn clouds are faint, and human feelings are also faint. I really don't know how many times my enthusiasm and tearful grievances have been deceived by hypocrisy. Now, I pity this physiological secretion.</p>
<p>The grass and trees, caressed by the seasonal winds, appear even more decadent and old. Poplars shed a pond full of hair, maple trees flushed red in the face, and the old sycamore leaves kept rolling on the garden path. Ah, I watched them sprout, I watched them shield people from the scorching sun in the summer, and now, I see them wither, wither, how fast! This process seems to only go from morning to night! What about the men and women who used to sit under their thick shade, whispering sweet nothings? I want to find them back, let them lean again under the decaying branches and sigh to each other.</p>
<p>At this time, I can't help but feel a sense of sorrow about the emptiness of living things. I need the comfort of some fruits. The male ginkgo doesn't bear fruit, and a scorched leaf sticks to the spider web under the eaves, whistling softly in the cool autumn wind. This sound seems so hollow. I always visit this garden with an empty mind, looking for fruits, but there are none, none... The brown seeds of the dodder have also burst and been buried in the soil.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the day before yesterday was an unexpected discovery. When I was smoking a mild cigarette, sitting under the grape trellis, I suddenly felt a temptation. A bunch of purple grapes was half-hidden in the scorched yellow leaves. I counted, one, two, three... crowded together in clusters, so many that I couldn't count them all. I examined them carefully, and there was another bunch over there, and another bunch over there, bunches and bunches of purple, translucent berries. Isn't this the rich fruit of late autumn? How can this small garden be empty!</p>
<p>That night, I had a wonderful dream: every corner of the world contains fulfilling components, and every branch of life hangs with ripe fruits, just waiting for people to discover, seek, and indulge in their desired sweetness. ...</p>
<p>(Indeed, everything in the world contains temptations as crystal-clear and radiant as purple grapes, especially when they are about to ripen. But people are too impatient to pick and swallow those unripe, green, and sour fruits. Therefore, people have two kinds of lament: lamenting that in life, they only tasted the frowning sourness, and lamenting that in the season of truly ripe fruits, they can't find a large quantity of sweet fruits to satisfy their desires. Therefore, the former is disappointment, and the latter is also disappointment.)</p>
<p>However, am I a patient person? Before discovering the purple grapes ripening on the trellis, I always thought that this small, rustic garden was empty.</p>

<p>Opening "Su Qin"</p>
<p>Unsuccessful Su Qin humiliated and ashamed. Burst into anger in his heart. He hated his parents for not acknowledging their own son. His brother was ruthless and would not let him stay. His wife was unwilling to lower the loom. All affection as husband and wife was abandoned. If I had known this day, I would have been greatly deceived. I regret not shaving my head and becoming a monk. Without worries or concerns, why pursue riches and honor? Flesh and blood are like strangers. Married couples are like enemies. What use is this life? It would be better to die and end all things. He looked into the well with both hands. Life seemed very insignificant. He was about to throw himself into the well when his uncle grabbed his clothes. Could it be that fame and fortune are difficult to obtain? Quickly tell me the reason. I presented a ten-thousand-word memorial. But it was opposed by Shang Yang. He was unwilling to present my request to the king. Crestfallen, I returned home ashamed. Just now, I went home. My family was heartless and unwilling to let me stay. Causing me to feel anger and have no way to vent. I would rather end my life by jumping into the well. Ah, my son, fame and fortune are determined by fate. How can wealth and honor be easily obtained? If you don't pass the imperial examination this time, there will be another time to pass. Don't be so short-sighted. Quickly go home with me. Bury yourself in your studies by the window. Uncle, I am grateful for your help. If I go to my aunt, she will surely take me in. Read ten thousand volumes of ancient books. Fame and fortune will come easily without worry. Su Qin had no choice but to follow his uncle home. Later, he was granted nobility by the six states. At that time, he returned in triumph.</p>

<p>Opening "West Chamber"</p>
<p>Apricot blossoms ten miles red. Miss Yingying in the room. Only for Zhang Junrui of the West Chamber. Too lazy to embroider in the boudoir. Yesterday, Hongniang went to the West Chamber. She said that Zhang Xiang Gong was sick in bed. I wanted to go and see him. But I am afraid of my mother's family rules. I had no choice but to write a letter to Zhang Junrui. Don't hang me in your heart. I immediately took out the writing tools. My slender fingers ground the ink. Gently writing the letter. Drawing the flower seal over and over. Then she cut off her fragrant hair. Wrapped with red and green velvet. She told Hongniang to take the letter to Zhang Xiang Gong. Hongniang obeyed the order. She passed through the corridors and turned east. Entering the two purple bamboo doors. All she saw was that the flowers and trees in the garden were brightly colored. Flowers and stones lined up in a chessboard pattern. Roses were woven into brocade screens. Happily, white cranes and crabapple trees were planted along the street. The old plum trees were very delicate. Banana trees were planted on the east side. Large phoenix trees on the west side. Thousand-year bamboo and pines faced each other. Red Niang was walking alone across the Shouxian Bridge. All she saw was the small bridge and flowing water. On the east side of the bridge were willows. Lotuses had not yet turned red in the pond. Mandarin ducks were embracing each other by the pond. Golden fish transformed into dragons in the lake. Hongniang was. Then she walked under the wisteria trellis. All she saw were hydrangeas facing her. She turned into the Peach Blossom Cave. Inside the Immortal Cave was the Old Man Peak. Enjoying the night scene in the Moon Gazing Pavilion. Rabbits often played in the grass. All she saw was the Mandarin Duck Hall built ingeniously. Chicken crowns, young and old, were planted by the rockery. She saw a study facing south. The furnishings were very exquisite inside. In the center was a rosewood table. Six fine plum stools on both sides. Mica screens were placed facing outwards. The God of Literature was enshrined in the center. Incense was burned in a bronze censer. Quickly descending, the incense smoke penetrated nine layers of clouds. A famous painting hung in the center. The brushwork was delicate and fine. A pair of couplets was on both sides. Silk-edged, rice paper red. The first line was, the wind blows the willow branches in lines. The second line was, the rain hits the peach blossoms in petals. She could not finish seeing all the sights of the study. She had already arrived at the inner room. She walked to the bed and stood still. She saw a scholar half-asleep. He was panting and leaning against a mandarin duck pillow. There was no page nearby. "Xiang Gong, I have been ordered to deliver a letter." Zhang Sheng heard and smiled. He took the letter and immediately opened it. Carefully reading it from beginning to end. The writing inside was very affectionate. Since that visit to the Puji Temple. Our hearts have been in love. That year, the bandits caused chaos. My mother betrothed me to my brother. You exerted yourself to repel the soldiers. You were a heroic white horse general. Unexpectedly, my mother suddenly regretted the marriage. I heard you were full of hatred. I urge you to take care of yourself first. Do not hang me in your heart. Wait until the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. I will send Hongniang to deliver a letter again. I will tell you my love under the moon.</p>
