<p>今日何日乃「一二八」之三週紀念也。苟一回想當日閘北戰鬭之慘酷地方之糜爛人物死亡損失之重大。我知凡有血氣者無不疾首痛心以寄其憤慨也。然三年以來。痛心固痛心矣。憤慨亦憤慨矣。試問其效能又何耶已失之東北曾因我之憤慨而收回耶日人政策曾因我之憤慨而改張耶。皆未也。至於我國物質上精神上之種種建設曾因我之憤慨而有急激之進步耶亦。未也。以是言之徒有憤慨外固不足以却敵内亦不足以建國。設今之紀而仍以鼓舞熱血爲能事。徒致憤慨爲了事。則此紀念亦多事耳。　　世間任何國家其盛衰强弱皆有其自致之道。我人若忽略其所以盛强衰弱之理。而徒致其一時之熱血。瞬刻之情感則必事過境遷。淡焉若忘旣無補於實際抑亦有礙於國家之大計。故今日國人所最應注意者。莫過於檢閱自身之弱點。而後痛改之。就我人觀察。國人弱點蓋有下列數種。除易感情衝動。缺乏理智的思考外。其一爲依賴心。自已之力量。旣不足自衛照理應先從充實國力着手。然多數之國人。今至今猶望外力之援助。非致其希望於美國卽致其希望於英國更有致其希望於蘇俄者。殊不知英美蘇俄。雖有不慊日本之行動。然以言對曰。則皆有特殊之立塲利害上有頗多關之處、必不能貿然出而相助也。其二則爲消極悲觀。以爲國事至此。已不足有爲則失望自殺。或則頽廢縱慾或則獨善其身。爲一已謀此三者不問其消極之程度何若。其自暴自棄。不能有補於國家則一也。其三爲推諉責任人民方面。每以國難責任歸之政府當局。而政府方面。又因意見不一。互相責備則政府人民以及任何方面。對於此次國難。皆應負相當之責任。蓋國家大難任何皆有責任若任何一個人皆能發憤有爲。則國家自强。國家旣强。政府亦强也。其四則爲缺乏民族國家觀念任何國家。於外患侵陵之中。無不立刻捐棄黨派個人之私。以謀團結禦侮之道。唯我中國過。遇此重大之國難猶不足以驚其心動其魄而消除其意氣。融洽其精神。謂爲民族國家觀念之缺乏。不亦宜哉。其五則爲長於議論空想。國人應付事情之眼光創建事業之計劃。就議論文字上言之。雖皆未嘗後人。然於事實上觀察皇皇計劃每多止於空言議諭。甚少進一步之行動。如是則雖有若何偉大之計劃。有何裨益。其六爲靑年缺乏刻苦耐勞之精神。如日本大學中之靑年。不分男女。每藉送報紙牛乳以補學費之不足。絕不稍感其執役之可恥。此種刻苦耐勞獨立自尊以圖他日爲國效力之精神。二十年前卽已如此試問我國靑年。有此精神否其七。爲民衆對外行動之缺乏紀律。我國歷次喪權辱國之事多由於此。所受敎訓甚多猶未覺悟無論任何國家對彼當局政策。縱有不滿。然國家個人之間。應加區分。故我人所應提倡者乃對於外人。保持自尊之精神。而去其浮誇採取彬彬有禮之態度。而去其狂妄自大。苟能嚴以律已動循軌範。則人又將何隙可乘乎。其八。則爲文盲過多。民族意識之强弱。依敎育爲比例薩爾投票之有此成績因十九皆受敎育之故。最後當爲我國人自私自利之心太重。民族團結之不易實現。一切事業之難以成遂莫不以此爲原因。此而不去則無論何事皆不可爲。况乎其爲救國大業乎。</p>
<p>總之國家之盛衰興亡。皆非無故苟我有可衰可亡之點。則雖無敵國餐患。亦必喪亡。苟不然者。則雖强鄰環伺亦可屹立於世也。</p>

<h3 id="c50">德國政治内幕 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>（國民新聞社德國通信）記者留德多年、對於德國政界情形、頗爲熟悉、今將德國新政府之設施、略述如下、</p>
<p>希特勒對其政敵之勝利、於德國有各種情形、吾人試將此等情形作概括之研討、可知實因時代之轉變、卽時代本身旣已成熟是也、德國國民自經大戰後、國政均有五十歲左右之人物統攝、而此等人物於同時代中、反覆援用同一之政制、</p>
<p>若吾人研究之、則可知昔日各政黨之行政及經濟政策、隨處均可發見其時政治人物之最高目的、在互相傾軋、互相攻撃、爲爰伯特、艾斯伯克爾、布勞及施特萊斯曼、拉特拿、與路得、此皆屬於當代參加政爭之人物也、</p>
<p>此種時代、經過二十五年至四十五年之久、政制未稍變更、以德國之血汗、賠償戰費、從無人能於德國實顯其有把握之政治才能、彼輩政治人物、只一意勇於政爭、而致自絕其出路、自造其後患、自布魯寗初次組成「前鋒内閣」後、而希特勒之呼聲、始日漸顯著、因此各國對德國之眼光一新、至此、彼輩專挖戰壕自衛之政治人物、始迫於不得已乃放棄其政治統治慾、</p>
<p>今日德國之新政府領袖人物、年壯力强比之曩昔之政府人物、少二十歲至三十歲有差、若吾人卽於年齡上一點觀之、則可知國社主義之政治與宇宙觀理想、與各國之政府、純然不同、辨别顯然、惟意大利之進展、則與德國之情形相彷佛、此種時代之先鋒、能使國家强盛者、法國固無、卽英國亦望塵莫及、</p>
<p>今日之德國、反覆以其和平意志、宣揚於世、今日之德國政府、於反覆呼籲和平聲中、致力於和平事業、因德國人民、本身深感戰爭之利害、故吾人之和平呼聲、確是最眞實的正義引證、德國之和平鐘聲、惟其同致力於和平公共事業範圍者、始能聞之、此鐘聲乃新德意志第三種國家、於外交重重困難情形中所發出者也、以爲解放歐洲形勢之心理因子、德國不僅願與法國或英國和平相見、卽凡本此旨之各國人民、亦莫不樂意與之親善也、</p>

<h3 id="c72">日本的石油問題（東京通信） <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>資源缺乏自給困難</p>
<p>日本資本主義向上發展、對外輸出、積極增加、如棉布的輸出、過去一年中比英國多了五萬萬餘平方碼、她一面普遍的開拓新市塲、同時更在英國擴張了不少的舊市塲、因此工業生產能力、突然膨脹、日本遂成了一個新興的資本主義國家、可是單靠經濟上和平的發展、很有許多障礙、所以必須用武力作後盾、極力把軍備擴張起來、</p>
<p>然而軍事上的擴張、除煤鐵兩項要自給自足之外、液體燃料石油、更加重要、日本國内所出產的石油、連北海道·台灣·以及庫頁島北部租賃蘇聯的油鑛、一齊算上、也是一年比一年减少、在一九二九年時、以上各地所產的石油、還占全日本所消費的百分之一四·二、到一九三三年、竟跌至百分之七·八、去年的統計、還没有得到確數、但據一般情勢推測、的確是更見减少了、那末海陸軍兩方面·以及民間工業界、在此需要大量石油的時候、能不視爲一種極大的問題嗎、</p>
<p>在兩三年前、日本曾經用過最大的努力、同荷屬南洋羣島當局交涉、想在那邊得到石油開採權、借以補助其國内出產之不足、但交涉結果、無所成就、因爲英荷石油公司、絕不肯輕易放棄她的權利、荷蘭也十分愼重、不願引外資隨便進出、現在比較有希望的、祇有庫頁島的油田了、但因這塊地方、氣候寒冷、開採上有種種的不方便、在冬季的運輸、尤感覺困難、要積極開發、是很費事情的、并具蘇聯又運用其國家統制經濟的權力、從事於油鑛的開發、蘇方鑛區的埋藏、雖比日方所租的更豐富得多、然絕不能出讓、所以日本對該處油鑛内想法、還不見得有充分的把握、</p>
<p>且蘇聯最近擴大其第二五年計劃ＢＡＭ大鐵道、在兩三年後卽可完成、該路終點是庫頁島對岸的廟街、她已據有運輸交通的便利、在平時日本的「北樺太石油公司」、决不是蘇聯經營的敵手、况日本的私營產業、在赤色法律規定底下、凡勞工待遇·資本運用·都要感受限制、要和赤油開發竸爭、自然更加困難了、假如一旦發生軍事動作、更覺没有把握、日本之努力開發石油、主要的目標、原在軍用、尤其是戰時的運用、所以格外擔心、</p>
<p>照目前國際情形、日蘇兩國間自不至立卽發生意外、但將來的衝突、恐怕終不可免、那末日本欲超越北海而掌握庫頁島的石油鑛、事實上大概很困難罷、一九一九年對西比利亞出兵的往事、那時候日本何嘗不曾以兵力占領庫頁島呢、結果還是無法控制、當蘇俄國力疲敝的時候、猶且如此、現在旣力足以自衛、恐怕更不容易應付了、</p>
<p>日本於此、遂不得不竭力設法凖備代用燃料、如木炭·酒精·油母頁岩的蒸溜等等、經過長期研究之後、在撫順設立了油頁工塲、可是這種製造、生產費旣比較高、所出的數量、也不很大、在目前是很不合算的、據聞日本各石油公司、最近都輸入美國與英荷所產的原油來自行精製、這樣辦法、在平時是很合算的、不過到了戰時、英美雙方、特别是輸入量最大的加利福尼亞的原油、必然要被摭斷、則燃料仍爲重大問題、所以一九三四年七月所頒布的石油業法、要該產業各公司都保有半年以上的存油、這在各公司的資本上和設備上、都發生問題、卽令能如數保存、而需要年年增多、也是一件長久麻煩的事、（一月十七日）</p>

<p>敵乎？友乎？（再）（續（</p>
<p>｜中日關係的檢討｜</p>
<p>㈣對中國當代人物認議之錯誤、對於人物的觀察和分析能胃之强，這是日本人所向西方人自豪的。但對於中國主要人物、吾人殊未見日本人能認議正確。即以日本外交時報等刋物屢次對於蔣氏之論評爲例、在日本人的評論中，常以蔣氏與中國過去人物如袁世凱李鴻章等相提並論，這眞是擬於不倫。袁世凱及李鴻章在中國歷史上有其各目的地位、此處不必加以討論，但蔣氏與袁李所處的時代，至少相隔一世（在中國以三十年爲一世），無論其出身不同，敎育不同，環境不同，即其所處之時代，尤絕對不同。袁李兩氏是帝制時代或科舉時代出身的，蔣氏自幼年時代，即已參加革命組織，以後三二十餘年間，在人生可型性最豐富的期間，始終不曾離開革命的事業，其敎育其思想可說一手由孫中山先生所陶鑄，其生涯始終没有脫離過革命的環境。吾人不認世界有所謂超人，每個人都受時代環境的影響，蔣氏之爲蔣氏，完全是在革命環境中成長出來，可說其血液其腦筋中没有一點前期帝制時代的意識習性之遺留，蔣氏與袁李之間的距離、可說是一個近代民國與幾百年前專制國家間的距離一樣，是屬於完全不同之兩個時代兩種型式的，今以蔣氏與袁李兩氏並論，以袁李的習性與識解來推斷蔣氏，眞如中國古　語所稱「老子與韓非同傳」一樣的滑稽。我所以斷言日本人對蔣氏實在没有認識清楚，因爲没有認清時代與人物，遂欲以從前所施於帝制時代遺留人物的方法，施之於現在，而希望得到同樣的效果、這是不言而知其不可能的。我在此處且舉一例，我非中國國民黨黨員，當然不知國民黨的對外方略的内容與底藴，但知國民黨之所謂對外的革命方略，是有其特殊一貫的微略的。當濟南事件以後，曾聞國民政府主席譚延闓責問當時的軍事統師蔣介石「旣要死守濟南，保以撤退北伐主力之兵？若要放棄濟南，何以又留一團兵力來死守濟南城，而最後又命其退出？」蔣氏答稱，「這就是我們革命軍的戰略、第一當然要表示不屈服的革命精神，並且表示濟南是日本兵力强佔的而不是中國自已放棄的。第二是要顧到革命的全局，不有牽住北伐的進行。第三是要保全中國軍隊，不作無意義的犧牲，只要濟南抵抗到三天之後，日晒强佔行爲已暴露於世界，則目的已逹，所以到後來仍命死守的一團冒險撤退，且使外間知我們要以一團人的力量，來對抗福田整個的一師團的兵力。」吾人觀察蔣氏對日本用兵，自上海，長城戰役，以至最後退出密雲之抗戰，可說都是濟南事件以來之一貫精神，這至少可以表示革命軍力量所在之地，不能無找價的放棄，日本欲以唾手而得瀋陽的先例，應用到全呀國，到底爲不可能。我們一再研究蔣氏對日本外交方針，回想到他民國二十一年一月間所發表的意見書，就可以看出他的主張對日本外交是「不絕交，不宣戰，不講和，不訂約。」他這個外交政策是與他對日戰略之所謂節節抵抗的消極戰術，與堅强不屈變動不居的革命戰略，是完全相應一貫，始終不變的。然而之種政策並不是澈底的，國内當時亦曾有人極端反對，但由今追昔，不能不說這個政策比較是無法之法，因爲國力兵力絕不相等的國家，只可用這個政策和戰略與之相周旋。日本如明白這個道理，應知日本若再欲以武力威脅中國而得到屈服的結果，可說是不能達到目的。此並非革命當局有如何突過前人的本領，就因爲時代不同，從前帝制時代或軍閥時代，遇到危險時期，就因爲當局者有保全自身利益名位的觀念，不能不畏怯而屈服，現在中國革命期内民族意識的高張，已絕不容當局有一毫之自私，旣然抱定「與國同殉」與「列而後已」的觀念，還有什麽畏怯顧慮的地方？中國方面採取這種「時時可死，步步求生」的革命戰略與方針到底，相持不下的結果，也必使日本同歸於盡。</p>
<p>㈤忽略中國民心理的錯誤　由日本近來對中國所取的種種步驟而言，不能不說「相煎太急而相知太疎」。日本人一面造成中國國民絕不能與日晒妥恊的錯誤的前提，因而認爲唯有消滅中國民族，日本纔可以安枕，而且認爲消滅中國，非出以極毒辣之手段，合萬刦不能翻身不可。關於第一點，我敢斷言中日之間並没有絕對不能轉圜的情形，此不必遠微其他，即就中國對於英國來說，中國國民對於帝國主義的侵略，當然要竭力掙扎以求得眞正之獨立平等的，英國爲帝國主義領袖的國家，對中國一切不平等條約，又是山對英鴉片戰爭而起，英國其始以殺人的毒物害我，其繼以不能擺脫的鎖鍊困我，這是中國國民深入骨髓的仇懚。著說中國國民自二十一條以來對日交惡有十餘年的歷史，那麽對英交惡就有八十餘年的歷史，但是在今日中國，可以說反英的感情並不如何濃厚，這固然因爲英國近來已改變鴉片政策，最大原因則由於英國近幾十年來對中國没有土地野心，所經營的祇在商業經濟方面，所以祇要許多不平等條約得以改正，中國是願與英國爲經濟的互利而與之友好的。日本人祇要認識此一點，便知道中國没有百世不可解的仇恨觀念、而好惡友敵，完全可以事實相轉移。日本如眞能放棄土地侵略的行爲，中國對西方各國，尙且願引爲朋友，何况同洲同種之日本？全日本爲東方民族，應明瞭東方心理，東方人的特性，尤其是中國人，就是重感情，重氣節，重禮貎與道義，今日本以估領中國土地極端傷損中國感情與尊嚴，復爲防制中國復仇而施以違反道義的行爲，中國即欲與日本提携，亦何能忍受此種屈辱形態下之提携？日本人唯其對中日關係看得太悲觀，以爲絕無挽回希望，所以日本爲猜防中國，要置之死地而後快。在這個方針之下，日本人一方面則用種種方法使中國疲於奔命，不但使用兵力，而且直接間接放任莠民擾亂中國各地的法律秩序，破壞中國的善良風俗，以前中國目前之死命，在另一方面，又不惜用極殘忍方法，企圖殘害並斷絕中國民族將來之生命，中國各地海洛英的販賣，多由日本商民經營，至少日本官憲是放任的。中國受鴉片之害，民族健康已受斷喪，至今對英國，雖恢復感情，但此一仇恨，百世亦難磨滅其痕跡。日本現在踵行其事，毒害愈烈，將使中國世世子孫永難忘却。日本爲消滅中國復儧力量，現在並且假手於各地無知漢奸或軍閥官僚，來仇視並加害於中國知識分子，不知中國知識分子永難除盡，百日本此日利用最下等之漢奸，此等漢奸將來亦即爲日本之大患，出爾反爾，其道正復相同。且日本所深惡者爲共產黨之方法，所標榜者爲東方民族之特性，現在日本常常想利用中國過去的無聊軍閥官僚，在各地造成日本式的政治，或成爲日本傀儡的政權，此事正令中國人民回想到從前第三國際，想在武漢，廣州造成俄國式政治的情形，畢竟廣州或武漢至今尙存有這類外力强造的政治痕跡没有？還不是因爲民衆共憤，起而驅除，歸於曇花一現？吾人敢正告日本，凡是有特性有國家意識的國民，最難忍受的行爲，即爲欲消滅其民族性與歷史文化。東方民族爲講道義的民族，東方人應痊重東方的習慣思想，凡是違反道義，出以暴力强制而近於虚僞殘酷的辦法，都不是東方人怕以容忍的辦法，日本如不欲在中國種下世代的深仇，我以爲應平心自反。</p>
<p>總之，日本的錯誤，在乎以通常國家視革命期中的中國，在乎誤認二十世紀爲十八九世紀而依然採用前世紀的乎段或傳統政策，在誤認革命勢力而視同帝制時代之遺留，在以對待官僚政治的手段而對付革命策略，而不悟日本之武力壓迫，只有脅制無知識之官僚軍閥，而不能屈服民族主義正在發達之國民。在另一方面，對於兩國關係的惡劣又認爲大悲觀，而不悟迷途未遠，只要抛棄武力與土地侵略，兩國國家間與人民間關係之好轉，實大有可能。</p>

<p>間接的舉措上的錯誤</p>
<p>以上已備論日本對於中國認識的錯誤，現在願進一步指出日本在對付國際所取舉指的謬誤，因本文爲討論中日關係而作，故祇以由對中國問題而引起者爲限。</p>
<p>㈠脫退聯盟而孤立的錯誤日本對中國旣造成一發難收的形勢，於是一方面則拒絕友邦的勸告，一方面則排斥國聯的决議，甚至不惜脫退聯盟，出於驚人的舉動，在日本所以自已說明者，即爲日本有獨自之立塲。但吾人局外觀察，日本口頭上以獨立爲標榜而實際則得到孤立的結果，實在就日本以言，獨立則可，孤立則不可。現在世界的趨勢，爲國際合作的趨勢，幾乎没有一個國家願意孤立於國際集團以外。譬如對於國際聯盟，蘇俄以主羲不同的國家尙且斷然加入，美國也放棄其傳統的不合作政策百傾向於加入國聯，今日本乃適在這個時期退出國際集團以外而願意孤立起來，溯其原因，由於欲貫澈佔領滿蒙混一東亞，與獨覇太平洋的政微所致，而不知完全陷於違反時代越勢的錯誤。世界上祇有一般革命未成的弱國，不得不主張獨自立塲而願意孤立於國際集團或條約以外，因國力不等，加入以後不能取得均等的地位和利益，只有義務而没有權利，寗以不加入爲得計；若在已有基礎的國家，斷没有自願孤立於國際以外的。日本在脫退聯盟以前，謀及重臣，咨及學者，可知也認爲問題嚴重，但欲罷不能，最後終出於毅然之一决。自從廣田登臺以來，雖然自命以各别折衝代替國聯的束縛，但日本旣不惜投一重大之暗影於世界和平之上，在此國際關係日益密切之時，自已造成舉世側目的地位，終不是日本國家的福利罷。（未完　）</p>

<p>救濟商業政策</p>
<p>實行統制并以整個政治力量推動</p>
<p>消極提倡國貨積極運用海關政策</p>
<p>年來因社會不景氣、全國商業、瀕於破產之境、日日社記者前日（二十五）特訪實部商業司長梁上楝、叩詢實部救濟計劃之内容、梁氏當發表談話如次、</p>
<h3 id="c131">破產原因 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>中國商業不景氣之原因、極爲複雜、舉其大要、約有數端、㈠</p>
<p>農村經濟破產、社會失其購買力、㈡國内生產落後、年年入超、社會流動金錢多被外人吸收以去、㈢國際貿易不發達、而國内市塲又多被外貨侵奪、㈣一切出品、失其調劑力、㈤過去外資因交通不發達、未能侵入内地、今則利用運輸上優越力量、逐漸擴展、達於鄉村、㈥海關無操縱運用之力、總上六點、牽涉範圍甚廣、故非一簡單問題、尤非簡單救濟所可生效、</p>
<h3 id="c132">救濟辦法 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>陳部長（公博）對於救濟全國、</p>
<p>商業、甚爲注意、個人亦頗富於研究興趣、曾作長時間之週密討論、覺根本辦法、非從統制着手不可、并須集合政府整個力量、統籌兼顧、蓋表面觀察救濟方法、僅屬之於實業部、至多與財政部有關、但實際上牽涉之處甚多、如鐵道·交通·外交·甚至軍事機關、亦莫不與此問題有密切之關連、據個人意見、是項整個救濟計劃、須由中央政治會議决定原則、然後分交各關係機關會同辦理、以最高之政治力量推行、庶可求得一完備之辦法、局部進行、恐無多大裨益、</p>
<h3 id="c133">各地商業 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>本年全國各地商業、受不景氣之徿罩、如天津·北平·開封·鄭州·太原·漢口·等處、大概情形均同、而北平開設二百餘年之瑞增祥、基礎動搖、現由商會出面維持中、其他各地·商店、倒閉亦多、悉由當地政治或商業集團力量、予以救濟、雖非根本之道、然拾此辦法以外、亦殊無其他完善之策、上海全體商店、去歲營業情形、亦屬盈少虧多、各公司之宣告清理或暫時停業、卽其明證、他如麵粉廠·紗廠·雖間有盈餘、實質上非本身商業之眞正盈餘、乃爲商業政策之盈餘、其所受之打撃、社會不景氣、固居其半、但外貨進口與傾銷、亦居其半、譬如前歲全國棉產豐收、而價格大漲、去歲棉花减少、而價格反跌、亦其明證、據上海糧食交易所經理顧馨一告余、去歲上海定購及已進口之洋米、共爲六百萬袋、價値七八千萬元、均銷售於内地、如許巨量之金錢、源源流出、社會上驟失其運用、商業上自然受重大影響、上海商業瀕於破產、雖不止此一端、要亦爲重要原因之一也、</p>
<h3 id="c134">提倡國貨 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>提倡國貨、本爲復興商業方法之一、但「提倡」二字、實係消極的、並非積極的、消極辦法、收效甚奧、外貨儘可運用傾銷政微、以爲打破之工具、積阿的則須賴運用海關政策、又非現在情勢所許可、故消極辦法、雖屬收效甚淺、但較之無辦法、似又略勝一籌也、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>我帶了人去騐屍，那城樓上的駐兵，他竟不讓我去。我跳着脚說：我是這一縣的縣長我房門口出了人命了，我自已看看，這是我自已的事，你管得着嗎？你除非把我打死，我就不過去。那兵没有了法子，才讓我過去。我一看那死人𩓐子上，有好幾道繩索的印子，當然是勒死的。我一搜死屍身上，有兩張信件，證明他是客邊人。旣是客邊人，當然在本縣曾住下客店。於是我把本縣城裏開客店的人，一齊找了來，問這死屍，是那家的客人。根底是相出來了，客店老板，只說他帶病出店去的，不敢招出軍隊勒斃的事。後來我嚇那老板，要打死他，他才實說了。我氣不過去找司令。他睡在床上燒大烟，笑着說：周縣長，你太多事。死個把老百姓，算什麽，當管的軍餉大事，三請四催，你也不來。城下死一個人，芝蔴大的事，你不管，也没有誰問你，與你何干？與我何干？你倒來見我。二位，你想這是人說的話嗎？然而他可是個小小司令。這一口氣，我是至今没有出得，只覺對那死人不住。第二，就是他們要錢。本來省政府籌辦得很週到，派來財政專員到那邊去，所有若干縣的財政，統收統支，餉由財政專員去發，不干縣長的事。可是那班軍人，一月等不及一月，不到日子，就向財政專員去要。財政專員也不會變錢，還是來找縣知事。這次，專員帶了一名連長，二三十名弟兄，突然駕臨縣署，限我三天之内，交出兩萬塊錢來。照着舊規矩，縣長遇到了這樣大難臨頭，便是把全縣各鄉的堡長找來，將他們一個個綑綁吊打。（一二三）</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>默默地，没有歡樂感，没有哀悉感，是情緒的眞空。</p>
<p>我以一束素色的水仙，一盅淡味的清酒，和一腔致誠，致祭於一二八烈士墓前。我没有做作的悲哀，亦不淌一滴弱者的眼淚，沉着，沉着讓熱血在肌膚裏沉着地奔流。野外透骨的寒冷，刀剌似的朔風，我都不怕，儘自握着兩個堅實的拳頭，悄悄地，低下我的腦袋。</p>
<p>黃色的墓土，枯了的蔓草，呵，烈士們；你們的血所灌漑了民族光榮之花，是永遠不會衰萎的。依稀地還能記憶，那是一個夢，那夥人是誰呵？滿身染着血紅，他們戰裏拖着血劍，歌着，那聲音···没有哀怨，没有悔恨，勇壯的曲調把我感動。他們向我招手說：過來吧，我們都是民族的先鋒！不曾生前相識，自然死後亦可相逢。便醒了。幽靈呵，我感到週身的血液變得更熱了。</p>
<p>烈士們！你們都先我們而死了，你們在天空如雨的炸彈之下嘶喊，你們在樹林似的三八式步槍陣中奔殺，爲着中華民族，不惜把胸膛去抵當敵人刺刀，血，流，流在竹園墩，流在廟行，流在江灣，····那敵人嗎，那敵人的頭顱也曾在我們勇士的刀下抛滾。嘿嘿！民族的英雄呵。你們這次的抗戰，是呌各帝國主義者稍稍顧忌了，他們目中的魚肉已變了一塊鋼鐵。</p>
<p>烈士們！我並不再想在你們靈前，多說出一些關於你們的豐功偉績，我不該悲哀你們爲民族爭光榮的死，同時，也不應該過份地歌頌你們的功績，因爲，這都是爲民族盡了極大的義務。我們後死者都應盡的責任。</p>
<p>我把水仙移上墓碑，我把淡酒潤濕着墓上，我希望暖熱的季節早早降臨，烈士的墓上重萌出綠色的草芽和血色的野花。揑着兩個堅實的拳頭，默默地仰望着天，天是青的，太陽是白的，情緒的眞空。</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>我有一個表弟，家境也並不怎麽好，所以自從表弟初中畢業之後，便東羅西掘的把他送到上海來，考進了某大學附屬中學的高中部。</p>
<p>表弟初來上海時，剪的是十數年前上海也曾流行過的東洋頭。身上穿的是自由布長衫，足上穿的是白紗襪，黑布面的布底鞋。</p>
<p>自從到了上海，才只一個月，頭髮便蓄長了。接着，便把中山裝式的校服，當儿了家常及服穿，把自由布長衫，去塞在箱底裏，而同時呢，白紗襪換上了花紗襪，黑布面的布底鞋，也已換上了籃球鞋了。</p>
<p>一學期之後，頭髮是朝後梳了，臉上搽着雪花膏了。上身是嗶嘰長衫，下身是西裝袴了。籃球鞋不過在校裏穿穿，出外時穿的是皮鞋了。</p>
<p>從第三學期起，身上穿起吳淞路上買來而修改着的西裝。白襯衫，花領帶，頭髮光光，臉兒白白的，竟然瞧不出是一位從農村中來的靑年，而居然是一位都市中的人物了。</p>
<p>同時呢，他也開始坐咖啡館，跑影戲院，有時還到跳舞塲裏去溜溜。而一方面呢。竟也玩起交女朋肥的調兒來了。</p>
<p>又這麽混過了一學期期，一弟忽然輟學了。起初我還以爲是經濟發生了恐慌。一天，表叔到上海來，談起了這一回事，才知輟學的原因，一小部份是爲了不勝負担，大部份，還是爲了表弟在上海有了女朋友，要和未婚妻解除婚約了。</p>
<p>我於是不覺喟然而歎曰：「上海是一個大染缸！」</p>

<p>關於闢除迷信的一點，我和光緒的見在是相同的，但我爲避免發生什麽意外的不幸事件起見，不願作過分露骨的表示，只得用一種富於外交家的氣息的圓活詞調來答復他。「除此以外，其實我也不能再有旁的表示了！不知皇上以爲怎樣？」「這都是迷信得可笑的奇談！」光緖倒一些不肯含蓄。因爲他知道在宫中所看的一起人物裏頭，不論上下，不論尊卑，差不多没有一個不要把他的言語行動去密告太后的；連隆裕也不可靠。其中只有一個人例外，這人就是我。所以他肯放膽的向我直說。「去年、還有一件事情，也許你是不曾知道的。就是當祭告太生廟的那一日，我彷彿是才聽到了一件比較有趣味的新聞，心上不免比往常要興奮一些；於是在祭禮告終的時候，我故意站到香案前去，挺着身子，舉起右手，行了一個外國人所習用的敬禮，同時還說了一句「老袓宗，請你瞧外國人的敬禮。可好不好？」這原是自已引自已笑笑的思意思，對於祖宗並未褻辱，要是他們眞有靈的話，也斷乎不致見罪。可是站在我近旁的幾個太監却早聽到了，光是給他們聽見，實在還是不妨的；偏是天下眞有那樣凑巧的事情，就在這一天的晚上，大槪總是白天裏所燃的香燭没有完全熄滅的緣故，竟死灰復燃的延燒起來，待到看守的人發覺時，太廟的一角已着火了，幸面人手衆多，拼命的灌救，才把這一座重要的建築物保留住了。這樣一來，那些迷信心最重的太監便紛紛議論起來了？（二三三）</p>

<p>— 緒鑫</p>
<p>自寗都收復後，余隨軍住地中月餘，偏僻小邑，苦無遊散之所，無聊殊甚。土人曰：離城西北八里許，有翠微峰，在剿匪歷史上頗爲著名，盍往一遊？惟其山勢，儉峻不易登，近數日來，上海報亦連日有專電，載江西熊主席等多人，某日乘汽車至翠微峰遊覽云云；觀乎是，大人先生尙去光顧，則該處或者確値一遊歟？遂於元旦後三日，請一導者，偕同事黃君慕陶張君英及小張君公仁，步出北門，循汽車路而往，此路爲新近修築，可直達山麓，路盡處，竪立一木製之牌坊，顏曰翠微峰，新建設物也。旣入口，山形展開如兩手，中抱一空坪，觀其氣象，已产平凡。内有田數畝，田之旁有溪流一，其聲淙淙。行纔數十步，一大山岩，突兀怪偉，若巨厦，若天柱，當路而立，氣象萬千。折而西行，山路愈上愈高，关途突有峭壁數仭，一東一西，中僅可容一人，我輩乃從其空縫中，傴偉循路，跋涉而上，旣出巉岩，其路始分岐。導者曰：欲上翠微峰之赤面寨者，須望右走；欲之翠微峰之金精山洞者，須向左轉。時我輩自册麓以抵山腰，已覺氣喘吁吁，汗流浹背，乃就岐路口少憇，討論片刻。因登赤面寨，較金精山洞尤艱，故我輩决議，趁此一鼓作氣，先從其難處前進。未幾，所謂翠微峯最高處之赤面寨，即高聳天半，屹峙於前矣。正面視之，乃一偌大之岩石，黝黑奇秀，奚止峭壁千仭！丁詩謂標峯綵虹外，置嶺白雲間，傾壁忽斜豎，絶頂復孤員，差可仿擬。我輩以旣登此峯，而不造其極，廢然而返，是太無勇氣，乃一一攀岩而上。以胸貼一壁，以手支一壁，效猿猱之上升，在岩罅中，曲曲折折，忽明忽暗，五步一頓，十步一喘，如是小心翼翼，如陟危棧，如登天梯者，凡半小時；忽覺凉風拂拂，空氣一新，跨過一天門，則我輩已至其巓矣，於是樂甚，盤桓其頂，長可百步，寬則半之，中立棋杆一，國旗迎風飄揚於天際，其他一無所有有之，僅數處腐草頽垣，委於荒草坪中而已。導者曰：民國十九年十二月，寗都二十六路兵變，城鄉富户，避赤匪之禍，類率結廬於此，腐草頽垣者，即昔日之臨時宿舍也。導者復指右面之峯曰黃竹寨，左曰觀音寨，合为面寨，計凡五寨，形勢均屬天險，寨中民團，遇匪不須開槍，只以巨石下投，孥可殲匪多人，故當時赤匪雖盡力圍攻，一二年不得破，惟當年各寨，雖貯有極豐富之糧食，而富人愛黃金，要不如藏金之爲多，金銀珠玉，不可充飢，經過一二年之支持，糧盡矣，民衆食及樹皮草葉，而寗都仍未收復，寨中民衆，除有數百人衝出逃生者外，不知餓死幾許，二十一年六月，觀音寨繼諸小寨攻破後，互爲犄角之勢遂失，而獨此赤面寨，猶未破也。十二月，匪方用僞計騙赤面寨諸富户下山後，即一一綑縛之，殺戮凡二百餘，慘哉！當年中央軍，亦嘗一度派飛機載麵粉食鹽，接濟之，惟投擲未中，爲匪所得，洵可惜也！我輩坐談良久，乃復攀援而下，折回到岐路口，經一碉堡側，而往金精山洞。洞在赤面寨後，低於該寨，其前有水一池，諸寨飲料，大半仰給於此，洞爲天然大岩石構成，洞旁刻四大字，曰金精勝槪。復有小靈官殿，旣入洞，豁然開郎，山花怒放，樹鳥爭啼。其岩環立三面，尢以其向右面出之岩，半蓋天空，抽前傾斜，長約數十步，石乳倒豎，如疊如削，如屏幃，極陸離光层怪之致。導者曰：此昔日避匪者之傏庫也。時日已西斜，人亦微倦，乃興盡而返。</p>

<p>— 余雲岫講　江晦鳴記</p>
<p>本刋自徵求各地醫藥衛生狀况後、應徵文字中，每對於各地醫藥衛生之叙述，不曰雛型粗具，卽謂尙在萌芽，良深慨嘆！二十三年冬，吾校曾舉行國語演說竸賽會，題爲『怎樣能使中國科學醫之普及』，承蒙余雲岫先生擔任評判，並擷取各演講員之論說，作最後一大評述，具見頗合時宜。本徧卽余先生之評詞，其所持議論，不僅精警透闢，發聾振聵！尤以歷數吾國醫藥衛生不發達之原因，披竅導窾，追根尋源，可謂針針見血如影如繪！爰爲公諸本刋刋，以備負有改進中國醫藥衛生之責者，懸爲借鏡。　　記者識於上海東南醫學院</p>
<p>諸君今日演講的題目：是「怎樣能使中國科學醫之普及」。諸君的演講：大多數以普及敎育爲普及科學醫的前提；我以爲單單要從普及敎育去着手，是没有用的。請看現在受過相當敎育的中小學敎員，大學敎授，以及政府裏面，黨部裏面的要人，他們生起病來，還不是有人要請舊醫去診治嗎？難道說他們的理智還不够嗎？從這一點事實年起來，我以爲普及敎育，是普及中國科學醫的後盾，並不是前提。根本的問題，還是在有知識的人缺乏明辨是非的頭腦和一貫主張的意志。</p>
<p>剛纔有一位同學提及，說是國府某要人，他病了還要請敎舊醫；還有一位提及日本新舊醫學的改革，我以爲很可做比例。日本自維新以後，科學醫的發達，全靠着政治的力量；我们中國的科學醫不能普及，也就是缺乏在政汉的力量，政治和醫學實在是聯繫爲一的。</p>
<p>我們知道，日本的醫學在明治未維新以以前，完全是漢醫的勢力，可謂風行一時。何以能自維新以後，就很迅速的轉變，而漢醫廢除，而科學醫中興，並不像我們中國，直到如今還在徬徨歧路，趦趄不前：這最大的原因，就是在日本漢醫界裏，早就有了力闢陰陽五行的革命論說。像後藤艮山，香川德修，吉益東洞等，他們醫學的著述，到處是實事求是，反對向來的陰陽五行，說是虚玄無用的。香川氏的書呌做「藥選」，吉益氏的書近來人把他集合刋行起來，呌做「東洞全集」，眞是漢醫學一部革新的偉著，諸君可以參考。就中有一部呌做「藥徵」，他用很樸實的觀察和記述，來推測藥的和用，絕對不講什麽五色配五藏五行合五色｜｜你脾色内屬土，腎色黑屬水的荒謬理論；而且時時對於陰陽五行加以駁斥。後籐是一七三三年死的，吉益是一七七一年死的，都是十八世紀時代的人。他們當時已經有了排除空論，進向實際的思想和議論，並且這兩人的門弟子很多，吉益東洞的聲名更大，門人更多，他的學說布滿全國，四方諸侯大夫，許多階級層中，都推服他的學說，所以政治的分子，也就因此有了相當的覺悟。故在和蘭醫學輸入以後，於是運用政治的力量，就很容易接受了。到了明治維新以後，政治的分子，抱定了宗旨，認清了事實，確見西醫學一字一名者有根據，乾脆就有和快刀斬亂麻的手段，澈　底把醫廢除，纔有科學醫的普及和躋列世界醫學第二位的今日。由此看來，這都是東洞等的學說影響，而達到醫學改革的政治力量！</p>
<h3 id="c249">屍體剖騐爲醫獄定讞之唯一根據 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>南通尹樂仁醫師被控一案，歷時已逾半載，南通地方法院曾有被告罰金一千元之判决，嗣尹醫師不服，乃上訴於高等法院，高等法院爲明瞭該案之眞相起見，遂函請眞如法醫研究所鑑定，該所鑑定之復文，其要點有二㈠施行手術時是否有相當數目之助手在塲㈡施行脊椎穿剌手術時突然針斷爲常有之事實，惟是否足以致死，須視斷針之部位而定，如斷針適在脊骨之間或脊椎外，毫無致死理由，如斷針適在脊骨間脊髓之内者，則可移行他處，一經剖騐，卽可明瞭，以上二點，洵爲最合理最公允之鑑定，而「一經剖騐，卽可明瞭」八字，則更有味乎其言之也，請申論之。</p>
<p>年來醫病訟案，數見不鮮，法院於處置此種案件之時，雖間亦徵求各地醫學機關之鑑定，以爲判决之參考。但鑑定者終属根據來文所叙之事實，而未嘗身歷其境也。夫病在人身，醫師爲人治病，不幸而病人死，是否爲醫師之過失，决非第三者理想揣測之詞所能洞中其肯棨，欲求徹底之明瞭，而使兩造心服，則非解剖已死病者之屍體，加以切實之檢騐不可。卽如轟傳已久之尹案，依法醫研究所之意見，其癥結卽在斷針是否適在脊骨之間或脊髓之内爲定。此種論定，誠爲精極，但究在脊骨之間，抑在脊髓之内，則旣非外人所得知，亦非空言所能斷。法院若根據此言，卽判决被告無罪，則病者似難心服，反之而判定被告爲過失殺人，則尹醫師亦可反問判决之法官從何知其斷針之適在於脊髓之内耶？凡此種種，皆属至難解决之事。最後之方法。惟有剖騐死者之屍體，以求徹底之明瞭而已·屍體旣行解剖，則斷針究在何處，不難一望而知，前此之疑團自可渙然氷釋矣。</p>
<p>夫訴訟之宗旨，在於求得眞正之是非，故法官之斷獄，自當根據眞確之事實，醫案之眞憑實據，全在死者之屍體，舍病人之屍體而尙訴狀或口頭辯論之空談，吾未見其能得是非之眞相也。故以吾之見，嗣後如有醫病之案件發生，法院首當以剖騐死者之屍體爲第一要義，苟或病家拒絕騐屍，則法官亦當拒絕受理，如是則法院於處理上可收事半功倍之效，而原被二告皆可省若干無謂之唇舌，而得眞正之是非。病家乎？如願犧牲死者之遣骸，則自可洩一時之憤，不然，則仍以息事寗人爲妙也。</p>

<p>麻瘋病，於公共衛生之預防上之重要性，夫人盡知。一年來上海麻瘋恊會，懸黨徵文，頗能引起醫學生之注意，可紀述事也。諸如上海慈幼恊會之努力，家庭工業社創辦兒童齒科醫院，對於公共衛生上，至足以補助衛生當局力所不及，吾人更望今後有關公共衛生之會社，能日日蓬興也。</p>
<p>暑期中，上海市衛生當局，對於市民疾病之預防｜｜如注射預防疫功，檢查飲水，處置糞便，捕殺野犬等頗爲認眞。故二十三年中霍亂天花等傳染病，極爲罕見！於此可見預防醫學價値之一斑。不寗惟是、南京·漢口·北平等各地，亦均致力防疫不稍疏忽，一年來中國境内之兇惡傳染病，除傷寒赤痢等外，很少流行。由此以言，凡吾國人，應知預防醫學之重要。</p>
<p>更有一事新喜而屬創舉者，上海市防癆恊會，兒童幸福會，兒童晨報社，市敎育局，市衛生局等五機關，於二十三年暑期，以半官式性質，假吳淞同濟大學中學部，開辦兒童健康營。時間雖僅短短六戥期，成績之良，出於意表，入營兒童，多能滿足吾人理想之目的｜｜｜養成良好衛生習慣，增進不少身心健康。復儧民族，卜於斯營，誠屬大有希望。</p>
<p>在未來大戰醞釀之危機中，當局怵於防空之重要，先後於上海南京試行防空演習，情形尙見逼眞。當地各大醫院及紅十字會，均有假想救護之設計，預料今後各大都市，或將仿效舉行。</p>
<p>一年來，新生活運動高潮揭起，當局對於禁烟問題、頗有以雷霆萬鈞之力厲行之决心，各地槍斃烟販，南京逮捕烟客，强令禁絕，均於公共衛生上有莫大良好之影響。至於北平檢查公娼，取締暗娼之綦嚴，同爲增進民族健康之善舉也。吾人敢竭誠以望，今後不蹶。</p>
<p>諸如贛南收復後之匪區，曾由上海地方恊會請託龐京周先生，担任災後救護事宜，河北河南上海南京等地設立平民產科醫院，免費接產，求治赤子產婦之槓天苦厄，在此一年中，谥公共衛生之設施上，均爲吾人聞之喜而不寐之事也。</p>
<p>（十三）結論</p>
<p>一年來吾國醫藥衛生之狀况，大致已如上述，其間雖有遺漏之事實，大體上之輸廓，差已呈現。結束此文，吾人所得之印象；卽二十三年中之中國醫藥徫生｜｜醫育異化之危險潛伏滋深，醫事糾紛逢起，醫團暗鬥至烈，醫派界限</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>未泯，舊醫迷夢仍酣，公共衛生未能普及，醫學出版界荒蕪待墾，新藥業僅發其凡，由是以言，吾人今後之動向，將何去何從乎？請認清事實眞相，在二十四年中，拂最大之努力，轉捩危局，確定目標，共同奮鬥！（完）</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十二）熱帶巨痞病（俗稱黑熱病）</p>
<p>（問）熱帶巨痞病，是什麽病？</p>
<p>（答）是一種地方性流行的慢性發熱的傳染病，而病變主要部，在脾臓肝臓的非常腫大，兼以貧血，消耗和浮腫的症狀。近來江北一帶，流行很猛烈。</p>
<p>（問）爲什麽報紙上常常有黑熱病的稱呼？</p>
<p>（答）這個名稱是從西文；ＢｌａｃｋＦｅｖｅｒ；譯成的。因爲西洋民間，把這種病俗稱爲「黑熱病。」但同時他們對於另外一種原因不同的傳染病，就是洛基山斑疹熱，也稱爲「黑熱病。」所以這種名稱，根本是外國錯誤的俗稱，（外國的一切事情，不一定是都對的）我們不必效尤。</p>
<p>（問）這種熱帶巨痞病，正確的西文是怎樣，還有其他的名稱嗎？</p>
<p>（答）拉丁文是ＳｐｌｅｎｏｍｅｇａｌｉａＴｒｌｐｉｃａ德文是ＴｒｏｐｉｓｃｈｅＳｐｌｅｎｏｍｅｇａｌｉｅ英文是ＴｒｏｐｉｃａｌＳｐｌｅｎｏｍｅｇａｌｙ；還有一個别名呌「卡拉阿薩」（ＫａｌａＡｚａｒ）。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的病原體是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）是一種鞭毛蟲類，因爲由拉西門氏和杜諾文氏所發見的，所以特稱爲ＬｃｉｓｈｍａｎｉａＤｏｎｏｖａｎｉ。</p>
<p>（問）這種病原體，寄生在病人身體的那一部分？</p>
<p>（答）寄生於體内的器官中，尤其多數存在於脾臓，骨髓和肝臓中。以寄生在内皮細胞爲主。</p>
<p>（問）患熱帶巨痞病的病人，和年齡有没有關係？</p>
<p>（答）患這種病的，以少年人居多數。</p>
<p>（問）病原體的傳播情形，是怎樣的</p>
<p>（答）以現在所知，這種病的病原，是由數種蚊蟲呌Ｐｈｌｅｂｏｔｏｍｕｓａｒｇｅｎｔｉｐｅｓ及Ａｎｏｐｈｅｌｅｓｐｕｎｃｔｉｐｅｎｎｉｓ、和一種臭蟲Ｃｉｍｅｓｈｅｍｉｐｔｅｒｕｓ的吮螫，從犬類傳播到人體。往往有一家族中，多人被侵的事實。</p>
<p>（問）熱帶巨痞病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）開始發病的時候，先有數星期的連續發熱，而這類發熱往往每天有數回的大上下（這是第一期）。此外，還伴有痢疾狀的病狀，見肝臓和脾臓的腫大；並且起貧血，很是强度。這樣的發熱和各種病狀，經過二三星期之後，消失；但脾臓肝臓的增大，都不絕進行；而貧血也漸漸增强。</p>
<p>（問）這樣的發熱和停歇，是不是反復不絕？</p>
<p>（答）是的。發熱屢次反復而停歇的無熱期，却逐漸短縮，這樣經過數月之後，脾腫漸大，到非常巨大的程度，有下達小骨盆内的。（第二期）。這時侯貧血的程度更深，並且增進到全身起惡液質和羸瘦不堪的情形。</p>
<p>（問）到第三期的病狀，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）病勢到第三期是已達極度。腹部非常隆起，皮膚顯出土汚色，所以有黑熱病的俗名。</p>
<p>（問）黑熱病的全部經過，要多少時間結果怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這種病，全部經過須半年到三年；結果是因爲惡液質和别種併發症（像肺炎，肺癆，敗血症等）而死。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的治療，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）現在都用銻製劑，像吐酒石，新斯銻波霜（Ｎｅｏ－ｓｔｉｂｏｓａｎ）或鈕奥斯登（Ｎｅｏｓｔａｍ）等的靜脈内注射，有相當的效力。每體重一百磅，注射○。一克，製爲百分之四溶液，隔日一次。注射的總量約計三克。</p>

<p>（三十三）猩紅熱（續）</p>
<p>。因爲發疹形同一片赤丹。故有稱本病爲丹痧。發疹的部位。一概先從鎖骨下部和頸部。漸次（二十四小時左右）蔓延於顏面較少，頭部，驅幹及上下肢等處。然而口唇周圍及鼻部。反呈蒼白色。並不發疹。這個特異的一點。對於猩紅熱診斷上。很有重大的價値。有時皮膚發疹。可以變爲異樣的疹子。因其形狀的不同。所以特有丘疹性粟粒性，水疱性，天疱性，斑紋性及出血性等猩紅熱的名稱。出血性猩紅熱大都病勢沈重。易致生命危險。所幸這等異形發疹的猩紅熱在臨診上，尙不多見啊。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的咽頭症候｜咽頭粘膜和扁桃腺，顯著發赤腫脹，稱爲猩紅熱性扁桃膜炎，如若炎症症狀更爲增進，那就軟口蓋同懸壅垂，料均腫大，同時扁桃腺上，發生灰白帶綠色或帶褐黄色的被覆物，病人的痛苦，更爲劇烈，嚥下當益困難，這等症狀狠像咽頭實扶的裏。</p>
<p>本病舌苔的變化，也狠特别，頗有注意的價値，就是在初期的時候，尙有灰白色或白色的舌苔，但是不久卽漸次剝脫，舌的表面，反而變爲清潔，顯出著明的深紅色，菌狀乳頭亦均腫脹，以致舌面凹凸不平，外觀上狠像貓的舌面，故特稱爲貓舌，但是近年來流行的猩紅熱，狠少貓舌的發現。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的落悄｜當發疹後的第三四天，疹子方始漸次褪色，普通疹子發得最早的部位，他的褪色也最早，大約經過一星期。反膚就可轉爲正常的色澤，體溫亦隨着疹子的褪色而漸次下降，復於正常的體溫，此時大概也就開始落屑，落屑的次序，也和發疹一樣，先從頸部，漸次及於軀幹和上下肢等處，落屑的形狀，有的像糠粃狀，有的如膜狀，所以臨床上有糠粃狀落屑及膜狀落屑的兩個名稱。（未完）</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>｜丙種齒槽膿漏症之療法｜</p>
<p>此症因其病原係全身疾病所致。故其治療方針。首在除去其病原。此時牙醫生必須與普通醫生合作。方可收効。其治療法分全身與局部兩種。局部療法。所有外科手術。及藥物等。與上述甲乙二種相同。其全身治療。則當委諸普通醫生。如係糖尿病所發生之齒槽膿漏。其口腔内之病狀非常明顯。故診斷較易。惟初期症候。並未顯著。故尿質之檢騐。對於牙醫診斷上。頗占主要。</p>
<p>｜齒槽膿漏症之預防法｜</p>
<p>齒槽膿漏之主要病原。係因齒牙周圍堆積之齒石除去齒石。清潔口腔。使無發生之機會。今略述數點于下：</p>
<p>㈠每半年請牙醫生檢查口腔。及手術洗牙一次。將齒石完全刮去洗凈。同時又可詳細檢查口腔狀態。怕費不多。而得益非淺。</p>
<p>㈡平時應多刷齒牙。每日洗刷三次。所用之牙粉牙膏。應含有防腐藥及收歛劑。同時對于牙肉亦須用牙刷摩擦。使其堅强清潔。此種方法對于預防齒齦炎。及齒槽膿漏。頗爲有効。因其藥物。可以直接與牙肉及粘膜接觸。並可浸入牙縫周圍。發揮藥力功効。</p>
<p>㈢如口腔内發現齒齦炎。牙肉紅腫。酸疼出血。有變成齒槽膿漏之趨勢時。必須立卽請牙醫生治療。同時用上述之牙膏洗刷牙齒。及摩擦牙肉。使口腔常保持清潔狀態。炎症早日消散。</p>
<p>㈣日常飲食起居。宜注意衛生。不可縱慾過勞。又宜多得空氣。日光及適當運動。</p>
<p>㈤如發現各種全身疾病時。必須立卽請普通醫生醫治。以免累及齒牙。</p>
<p>上述五種預防法。對于預防齒槽膿漏非常有効。如能早期注意。則可免除後患。此篇僅舉簡易有効之方法。其涉專門手術。過于複雜。非一般讀者所易明瞭者悉從略。（完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>Ｘ光在本病診斷上的眞正價値，是如何的情形呢？我們當然决不能說，他對於一切的種種，都有堅决的是非的：就是此外的種種檢查法，也不能說，自有Ｘ光的應用後，都可消除無餘的。但是尋常臨床上檢查之所得，因藉Ｘ光的診查，加以最後修正和補亡的地方，確不在少處的。像上面所述的病灶面積的大小，疏密，形式，都是最好的例子：空洞的面積大小，形式，也是一樣的。至於距離肺表面較遠的病灶，所謂中心性的本病是；在物理檢查一方面，幾乎是毫無的得的，甚至範圍擴大的病灶，也是如此。但經Ｘ光照視，卽可完全發現，而無所遁逃的。對於本病種類上的辯别，滲出性增生性硬變性三者不同的地方，這在病理解剖上，有時已有好多困難的地方了！Ｘ光的診查，當然不能完全擔負的。但硬變性的病灶留影，是和周圍的界限分得特殊明顯的；石灰體沈着的留影，也是特殊濃厚的；這和滲出性的留影，是完全不同的。關於早期診斷一層，所謂初期病灶的認識，Ｘ光的診視，也是没有什麽驚人成績的。我們如果說：病理解剖所得，佔百分之九十：則他所得不過是百分之十景。這雙方的距離當然是太遠了，但也是限於事實如此的。讀者們要曉得，肺臓是帶立方體的器民，Ｘ光診查的留影，不過一平方面積：在這許多平方中發生的病變，都重複堆積在一平方上面的。我們僅藉留影方面所發現，而欲處處得必然的决斷，當然不是個個可以辦得到的了！此外，他對於幾種模範型式的本病，像肺門肺脈體結核，肺尖結核，乾酪性肺炎，急性粒結核等，也有不少的發現，足以補充其他種種檢查之所不及的：但這都嫌太專門了，尋常的人們，也用不着這樣清楚的，所以本文也一一概從略了！</p>
<p>關於他的診查，尋常大概都經過「透視」和「攝影」兩重手續的；這在被檢查者大半認作重複而無意義的。其實他們是各有短長，未可放棄任何一種的。攝影是可以長期保存，俾可繼續探究，不像透視是刻頃的探視，并且是一過而不留的。但透一手續，也有他的特殊地方；像樸隔膜和助骨當呼吸時的動作，肺部的擴張與收縮，肺尖在咳嗽時的變化，心臓及大血管的搏動，種種情形，都要藉透視手續方能認識清楚的。這是攝影方面萬萬達不到的。</p>
<p>Ｘ光診查在本病診斷上的價値，上面已經述過大概了！總結一句，他對於其他臨床上檢查之所得，加以補亡訂誤的地方，確不在少處，値得人們禮讚的。但對於本病種類的辯别，以及病灶變化是否在急端進行中一層，係没有多大成績的。這一個斷案，當然使一部分人覺得失望的。但卽就此點而論，其造福於人羣之大，已非作者這枝笨筆所可形容的了！（第八章完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c256">三年前的今天 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>三年前的今天，上半天，我是在吳淞過的。我還記得，一，清早起來，照慣例一個人跑到黄浦江邊去踱着子，一面眺望遠海烟霧迷濛的海面。</p>
<p>我翻開一本書，看了幾行，放下了，不行，完全没有讀書的心情。九一八日本帝國主義的砲聲，轟燬了我讀書的旨趣。本來從前我每早都要來江邊看一點鐘書，這以後，十回有九回看不成功。望着遠海的景物，每每就給我相起東北的故鄉，每每就擔心起故鄉遭受的蹂躪與痛創。我並不是抱着「救國不忘講」宗旨的人，其實我那時旣不想救國，也無心讀書，整天整夜緊纒着我的是說不出口的苦悶與悲憤！</p>
<p>吃過午飯，我打算再到江邊走走，剛要走，韓章跑來跟我說：</p>
<p>「走｜！到上海開會去！開同鄉會，就走！」</p>
<p>我搖頭，但他硬把我拉走了，他一邊走，一邊哮噥着：</p>
<p>「你這書呆子，國難當頭，還不起來救國麽！你不參加行麽！」</p>
<p>聽他話，好像一開了同鄉會，就可以救了國似的。我雖然不想救國，但是聽說别人能救國，想救國，那我是非常高興的，尤其是我們東北人，更應救國。</p>
<p>如果開了同鄉會就可以救國救家，那我無論如何也要參加的。</p>
<p>下半天，我們乘了免費火車，到了上海。</p>
<p>所以是，三年前今天的下半天，我是在上海過的。</p>
<p>在中社開完了同鄉會，時候已經六點半鐘，街上臨時戒嚴的租界當局布告，阻住民們回吳淞的途程。同時，又聽别人說淞滬車停了夜班，就縱然跑到北站，也未必能回得去，我跟着幾個同鄉到一個住在貝勒路的同鄉處借宿。</p>
<p>這個同鄉只住着一間小前樓，平空添了這許多人，睡眠上就大起恐慌，不但床舖不敷分配，被頭也不足用。這是一月的二十八日呀，時候還是在冬的季節中，夜裏没有被蓋是難得睡覺的。怎麽辦呢。大家有些發悉。</p>
<p>猶豫一會，讓屋主人想到了辦法。他並没有說出來，他先跑到樓下二房東處去，然後再上來時，我們就都明白了。他手裏拿着一盒麻雀牌。都笑了，問題跟着解决了。</p>
<p>打麻將，每個人大概見到都想玩玩的，雖在國難，也不能停止這種消遣。我們人數多，後來决定抽簽，我落選了，但我却有了睡覺的地方。我睡了，那時約有十點鐘。記得睡前我跟四個戰將說：</p>
<p>「明早早些喊着，我要早一點回吳淞。」</p>
<p>睡着睡着，打牌的人把我喊醒了，我還以爲亮了天，但是電燈還没有熄。同時，我聽到屋前屋後　　　的人語聲。</p>
<p>「快起來，打起來了，一定日本兵打起來了」！</p>
<p>這個喊我的人說完，抛下我，跑到晒臺上去。屋中只剩我一個人，伴陪我的是桌上零亂的麻雀。</p>
<p>時睺是半夜。我穿上衣服到晒臺上，迎面揭起一片紅光，槍砲聲連珠般響個不停。</p>
<p>「這算是打起來了」。</p>
<p>「好，這回可出了氣，日本人太欺負人了」。</p>
<p>「打得對」！</p>
<p>「一定着着了大火，要不不會這樣紅」。</p>
<p>「寳山路一帶地方吧，北站左近吧」？</p>
<p>晒臺上，弄堂中，人們七嘴八舌說着話，都在對着同一個地方出神。我想，這次戰事總該不是中國發動的吧·｜｜自然不會的。</p>
<p>第二個九一八的武劇，到底又在上海開演了。日本兵這樣横蠻？我想，這大概就是帝國主義比我們弱小民族文明的地方吧？</p>
<p>三年後的今天又到了，使我想起三年前的今天使我寫這樣一篇簡短的回憶。</p>
<h3 id="c257">話從什麽地方說起 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>假使不是多餘的、到了這樣一個有其重要歷史意義的日子，又得講幾句話。不過話從什麽地方說起，却成了問題。方面是太廣了，問題是太嚴重了。我們如果不是全無心矸的話，我們對於那近在我們眼前的被人摧毁的敗壁頽垣，自然要起無限的傷感，我們對淪亡的領土，自然要起無限的悲哀，我們對於那正在侵犯我們的疆土的漢奸及指揮漢奸的敵騎，自然要起無限的憤慨。土地與權益，是有限的，而他們的貪欲是無饜的。未解决舊的糾紛，又生出了新的糾紛，連續不斷。他們三年來的外交策略，軍事行動，其一網的目的，就是如此。軍事行動，繼之以外交的宣言，外交的宣言，又斷之以軍事的行動，眞理的樹，永遠是裁種强横的敵人的庭園中。在這有重要歷史意義的日子，對於這問題，我們至少也得考慮一下了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c258">没有月亮的月夜 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>大家都嘗聞名吧；南歐意大利一帶的海濱湖畔，景色多半是那公地秀麗，那麽地澄清可愛！但倒似乎很少聽見我們的中國，也嘗有一個地方｜｜連在夜裏，没有月亮的時份，也活像一個散佈着幽美皎清的銀光的月夜，那樣的景色。</p>
<p>這就是提起不北，便要想及的西南呵！那邉疆僻地的雲南大理。就是出產世界有名的大理石的地方呢。莫怪山水氣色，是那麽地秀雅：可是，誰還担念這些可愛山河｜大理呢！</p>
<p>一面是臨着　海，一面是靠住蒼山，這海和山環抱的中間，便是百里平地的大理了呵｜比四川的貧地還要好些，從頭看到尾去，盡是同樣的田野房子，其他的便是上面蔚南的天色，澄靑的海水，秀綠的高山。大理的地勢就像一條魚兒吧，長長的一百里，横史有十多里至二三十里，那頭尾出入口的地方，便是海與山相接之處。</p>
<p>這兒憑着天然的出產豐富，和没怎　樣遭受資本主義經濟的摧殘，農村配合着那樣安靜幽美的景色，還似乎較幽閒的躺着。</p>
<p>在夜裏，登高山而望，幾乎全大理都可隠約看出，二三十里之内，連一支樹木也可以辯别出來。甚至二十里之遙的喚聲，都可以清楚聽見。空氣的澄清和高爽，天色的潔白一片，看去就彷彿像月圓時的月夜時分！</p>
<p>天上的雲兒陰鬱的散飄着，月亮是收歛了牠的容姿；但是，從大理城和城外的鄉下，可以仰望見蒼山上的樹木，一支支，清楚的幽豎着。大地是籠罩着皎皎銀光似的。從外邊到大理去的客人們處身在那兒，一定要瞪眼凝神的驚呌：</p>
<p>「這樣幽美的月夜喲！：：：」</p>
<p>但是，穿破四週皎潔的白霧，找不到一輪圓月。這没有月亮的月夜，會使人們疑是在做夢呢！</p>
<p>幽曠，皎潔，清新，秀爽，這大理的夜呵！好像不是人間！那麽地清靜皎潔的氣色。</p>
<p>到了這没有月亮的月夜的大理，會使人好像踏進了世外桃源，心腦輕快清爽了萬倍。這該是可沉醉的山河吧｜可留戀的處所吧！</p>
<p>然而，好像做着美夢的大理，誰能老記掛着牠呢｜那邊僻之地，誰能多去見見牠呢？</p>
<p>百里綠水的洱海，百里靑山的蒼山夾抱着的大理喲，没有月亮的月夜的景色。</p>
<p>幾時再能翎識你的容姿？</p>
<h3 id="c259">自然科學小品文究竟要寫些什麽？ <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 怊兼</p>
<p>我自已連一篇科學小品文也不曾寫過，如是很狂妄地說别人的科學小品文差不多都寫得不好；假使有人問：自然科學小品文究竟要寫些什麽呢？這一問，會要問得我噁口無言；因爲我自已也不曾把這件事通盤地計劃過。</p>
<p>現在，就把我一時想得到的寫一點出來吧。至於寫得不够或是錯誤的地方，我是希望有些朋友們出來補足或是糾正的。</p>
<p>第一，自然科學小品文似乎要去指出當前自然科學上的缺點，尤其是方法上的缺點；因爲不僅演繹法，就是師納法也不能驾駁下目前已經積存的許多經騐材料了。、</p>
<p>第二，要去指出過去的自然科學家，他們那種拒絕採用新方法的不當；同時，還要指出，他們在事實上早已有意無意地採用過一部份新的方法了。</p>
<p>第三，要去提醒一般的自然科學家，從此放棄那種只管「自然」不管「社會」的態度；因爲自然科學的發達生發達以及牠一時的停滯，都是和人們的生活息息相關。</p>
<p>第四，要把進步的方法，去整理每一科裏面由經騐得來的材料；同時，要在這些材料上去發現牠本身上内在的組織與過程。要用運動的法則，去代替因果的法則。由這樣的辦去，把每一科的基礎都建築在牠本身的矛盾上，使牠全部的材料，構成一個有機的系統。</p>
<p>第五，把自然科學的各科，連成一個網串的組織；在牠們的本身上去發現由這一科向那一科的推移。</p>
<p>第六，指出新的方法，牠在自然科學上的特殊表現；同時，更指出牠在思维上在社會科學上的一般表現。</p>
<p>第七，由上述這些方法所得到的成果，更去充實哲學的内容。一方面使那些歪曲的理論，失去牠最後的逃難所。</p>
<p>第八，當這個你也喊嫠國我也喊救國的時候，「科工救國」的口號也有人喊出來了。在最近所出的刋物上也有些在那里大談其「科工」。我們應該指出；目前的自然科學已經走到了哪一個站口；我們應該要怎樣才算是「迎頭趕上」，要怎樣才不是「跟屁股追」。並且要指出；科工和救國究竟有多少關係。</p>
<p>第九，國内出版的「科學」「科學季刋」，和近年出版的「科學的中國」一類的刋物，我們對於牠們應該加以一番檢討。在這種塲合，我們也應該提醒過去一部份人「只管社會不管自然」的不當。</p>
<p>自然，上述的那些問題，有許多在目前還只能算是一個目標，並不是馬上就能够一一地實，「科工」對於「救國」的問題，舊的自然科學拿做了「新」的哲學容的問題，都已經擺在我們的面前等待我們去研究呢？</p>
<h3 id="c260">小牛和阿福 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>接連發了兩天西北風，今天早晨起來，紅紅的太陽光照在波璃窗上；風聲不再吹響，天已晴正，可是冷了。偶然到窗口去探視，看到小河裏已經顯露了底。記得昨天傍晚，河水還是滿滿的，覺得有點奇怪。向前望去，同小河連通着的大池子裏，也已没有了水。原來閘已打開，放乾了水，許多人正在捕魚。</p>
<p>隠隠約約的可以望見，高舉着的網上，有魚在閃閃的發亮。爲着看個清楚，洗好乎臉以後，我就走了過去。</p>
<p>校工長生已經先我站在那裏，他正在向着一個瘦長的人發問，「小牛，你已捕了多少魚了？」</p>
<p>「還只有兩三條，」小牛仰起頭來回答，古銅色的臉孔上面，濺着不少泥點了。他很用勁，跨一步，仆下身子伸着兩手去捉摸。再跨一步，照前的動作一下。</p>
<p>「阿福！你也來捕魚麽？」</p>
<p>聽到了長生這問話，我旋轉臉去，就年垤個笑嬉嬉的小夥子，是新來到的。</p>
<p>「我也來捕魚，你要喫麽？」</p>
<p>阿福一邊這樣回對，一邊緩緩的捲他的袴脚；點上了根紙烟，嘴上咬着，他才慢慢的跨下池子去。</p>
<p>到了池子中間，阿福只是站在一個水潭裏；靜靜的等着，看到水面起暈了，才很快的伸下手去，隨即拏起一條白白的魚來，甩動着尾巴，被他塞進他背着的簍子裏去。</p>
<p>預備鐘鐺鐺的響了，我有課，連連忙趕回校中。上完了第一堂的課，我才吃稀飯。第二第三兩堂我都空，就又踱到池子邊上去年捕魚。阿福已經看不見，只是小牛，仍在跨一步，仆下身子伸着奧手去扣摸；再跨一步，照前的動作一下。</p>
<p>他的兩隻袴脚上已經濺滿了泥，手臂上也已見不到一點皮膚，好像原是兩段泥藕。偶然他仰起身子來伸了伸腰，哦！他的臉孔顯現了，已經變了個大黑麻子。但他馬上又俯下去、</p>
<p>，依然跨一步，仆下身子伸着兩手去扣摸；瑞跨一步，照前的動作一下。</p>
<p>傍晚，長生給我送飯來了。擺好了菜籃，他先向我笑了笑，隨即問我，「許先生！你要吃魚麽？要吃我可以給你送來的！」</p>
<p>「你也去捕了魚麽？」我回問。</p>
<p>「不，」他答，「是小牛給我的。說起來，是｜｜許先生！我告訴你；今天小牛和阿福兩個人都去捕魚，早上你也看見的。小牛工夫捕得多，阿福去的時候，小牛已經捕了許多時候。小牛是第一批去捕的人。阿福不過捕得一個鐘頭就走了，小牛是最後走的。魚自然也是小牛捕得多點，要差一半的樣子。其實是阿福捕得快，一個鐘頭捕了四五斤。｜｜小牛四五個鐘頭，一起不過七八斤。但是錢還是阿福賣得多；他趕先挑着去賣，兩角四分錢一斤，馬上賣完。等到小牛挑着去賣，一角六分錢一斤，没有人要買了，因爲都已買好；時候也遲了，人家已在吃中飯。後來只賣一角錢一斤，還是賣不脫。没有辦法，他索性送人，也給了我一條！」</p>
<p>這樣說了，長生瞪眼看看我，顯得不勝慨歎的樣子。我說這幾天胃裏不好，吃不得魚，他才彳亍走去。</p>
<p>人原有着聰明的和不聰明的兩種；不聰明叫做笨。要是没有笨的人，也就無所謂聰明了。</p>
<h3 id="c261">人間世（十）（一） <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>「不行！不行！今天没有你就别想再開！」</p>
<p>「那麽你等到十二點好不好？過十點才能上客，那時候也許差不多的。」</p>
<p>她又退了一步要求着。</p>
<p>「不行！不行！」</p>
<p>朝鮮人是要錢，非要把錢要到手不可。</p>
<p>他這人眞是蠻横，簡直不容人說話。但他爲什麽就這樣不和氣呢？就算是欠他錢，也未必幾點鐘工夫都不能緩一緩。</p>
<p>他反倒更氣冲冲地說：</p>
<p>「别的錢可以緩緩，這筆錢怎能不按時交！」</p>
<p>現在，又給我進一步明白出來，他是在烟館事業上行使他的職權的，所以他才會蠻横到這種地步。他確是烟館的主子。女主人一味馴地回答着他，就像一條耗子擺在老貓的眼前似的，不敢錯哼出一聲。</p>
<p>弄得没有辦法，實在求不下情，女主人退下來自已手上一只金戒指，還摘下小菊手上的一只，放到這位金先生的手裏，還是帶着笑臉說；</p>
<p>「那麽金先生，費你心給賣賣好不好？」</p>
<p>誰說她們的生活是如意的呢？她們才可憐得很，她們是奴隸的奴隸！是的，我這一趟没有白來，靠我的朋友的領導，到底讓我開到了風氣。</p>
<p>小菊呆呆地站着，我的朋友默然不語，但他那臉紅氣喘的情形，顯然是在生這生客的氣；什麽氣，攪了他的好事？我呢。我覺得人們生在這世界上，如果不甘進取，想苟安偷生，有永世遭受别人的踐踏！</p>
<p>擺在我面前的，就是很好的一個證例。</p>
<p>女主人趁這時把事情講出來，好像怕我們不明白。她說這是應繳的月費，，不怪金先生生氣，只怪自已不好，没有在事先凑足錢。然後她還笑着說，請金先生不要見怪。金先生並没有回她話，把戒指揣到懷中，也不和誰打招呼，昂然不拔地走出去了。</p>
<p>「我們也走罷。」</p>
<p>說完，我和我的朋友跟她們作别，我們又在黑暗的小路上走起來了。我直感地以爲我的兩脚是走在另一個世界上，但是不對，依然還是没有脫離人世，没有溜出這哈爾濱的人間世。</p>
<p>我開了風氣了。確確實開了風氣了。（完）</p>

<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>（二）結價標凖之變更</p>
<p>在歐洲大戰以前，英京倫敦爲世界金融之中心，其遠東方面之經濟勢力極大，故彼時上海標金之結價、係用英鎊爲標準。迨歐戰爆發後，歐洲方面之金融，俱告紊亂，我國標金之結價，亦放棄金鎊，而改用日金。及至一九三一年底，日本放棄金本位以後、日匯跌落甚鉅，我國且不開日匯，上海標金乃改以美匯爲結價標準。一九三三年四月，美國放棄金本位以後，直到去年一二月間，美匯變動，飄忽無定，而羅斯福貨幣政策之將來趨向，尤莫測高深，聞當時現行貨幣改低幣值之傳說，因此上海金業交易所爲防止發生變化起見、乃於去年二月二日，議定新規，改以英匯爲根據，進而求美匯之新價，從價値穏固立塲論之，其已成之交易，仍照舊法清理，至三月份止，即三月期結價時，每標金一條，以美金二百四十元爲標準。同時復創新法，將標金結價，變更計算方法，凡標金一條，成色爲，九七八，重八·五二五漕平者，自二月十六日起，四月期登塲起舉行，結價時則標金一條，以美金三百四十六元爲標準，故三月期與四月期市價之差額，達地百數址元之多。向例標金結價，根據美匯，每條標金，計値美金二百四十元，同時標金之秤量係以漕平爲標準，當時奉行政院功令，將於四月期新交易開始買賣時，改用市平，市平之折合率爲漕平之八五·二五，去年三月一日美國正式宣佈法定金價，每盎斯三十五元、每元美金貶値爲五角九分零六毫，由是以美金新定成色，與上海標金新定秤量，相互折合，其計算式如下：</p>
<p>（２４０＋５９０６）Ｘ８５２５＝３４６４２７帮故標金改秤後，與美金改値後，其新折合之標金價値，每條標金，値美金三百四十六元四角二分七厘，因此之變動，基其計算標金結價之方式如次：</p>
<p>＄３４６·４２７÷（若當日美滙行市）＝１０１８·８元（標金結價）</p>
<p>至去年十月十五日，復因財政部爲防止標金投機起見，管理標金之買賣，頒令今後標金之結價，須以中央銀行掛牌之海關金單位爲根據，標金一條，等於市平十兩，成色爲·九七八，每一市平兩，則等於四八二·二六一一格蘭純金，而每一格蘭，實等於·零六四七九八九一八公分純金，故標金一條，實等於三零五·六二公分。</p>
<p>１０×·９７８×４８２·２６１１×·０６４７９８１８＝３０５·６２公分</p>
<p>今關金一元，合得·六零一八六六公分，故標金一條·所得之關金數，應爲五零七·七九。</p>
<p>３０５６２／６０１８６６＝５０７·７９關金（定數）</p>
<p>設本日之關金市價，爲一·九四九元。則標金市價，應爲國幣九八九·六八元。</p>
<p>５０７·７９×１·９４９＝９８９·６８元</p>
<p>（三）外滙標金投機之取締</p>
<p>去年九月九日財政部訓令上海各銀行，限制國外匯兌買賣交易。據訓令大意謂：外匯交易除㈠合法及通常營業所必需者。㈡二十三年</p>
<p>私人需要者，同時標金方面，又令金業交易所取缔標金之投機，所有新做交易，應用現金交易，不准再用外滙結價。於是經濟人召集開議，决議十月份期貨交易以時間侷促延至十月底了結，十月十五日起，開做新標準，遵照財政部命令，改用世界金塊折算之關金爲標準結價。詎後接財政部訓令，十月份舊交易，凖於延期一個月，不准再做新交。應即日起，開做新標凖，依照英京倫敦生金核計之中央銀行掛牌關金結價，經金業交易所理事會議决，十月十七日起十一月份爲延期了結，同時開做十二月期貨。</p>
<p>財政部之取締標金之投機，緣近年來交易所標金投機之風甚熾，買賣標金實際上並無需要，仰外滙之鼻息，以爲投機之趨向，美金高，則購買爭先，標金因而高漲，反之，則售出恐後，標金因又致降落，實際形同賭博，徒擾亂標金市塲。且外匯權操自外人，以致轉瞬之間，傾家蕩產者，指不勝屈，故不得不毅然加以取締，旣所以保障人民之身家性命，亦所以穏定社會金融。</p>
<p>再則所以取締標金用外滙結價，而易以中央銀行關金掛牌爲標凖者，即中央關金之掛牌，乃根據於倫敦鑫塊及在條行市而定，換言之，標金依海關金單位結價，一方面使金價置之於倫敦金銀供求自然狀態之下，不爲人力量所操縱。（倫敦爲金銀礦主及商人菌集之處，故其金塊價値在平時足以代表金銀供求之天然價格。）一方面使滙兌視綫，由滙豐銀行而移轉於中央銀行，使中央銀行對於匯兌上之機能擴大，且使逐漸有統制金價之可能。對於金價有相當之統制，而能使之穏定，不隨飄搖無定之美元而趨向，此則不但使商人爲之欣慰，於其商品之價値，可有確定之計算，即對我國滙兌業上，亦樹立了一種光榮的權威，但其完全實現，自須加以相當之努力也。｜二十四年一月九日。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c269">又是一二八 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>又是一二八！這慘痛的傷痕，到今天雖已滿三年，不但尙未復元，甚且愈增劇重！敵人給與我們的致命的打撃，是何等的厲害！我國民心不死，此恥必有洗雪的一日！</p>
<p>一二八是日本繼九一八後發動的一個陰謀。這個陰謀是有深遠的計劃的。不只有深遠的計劃，其計劃且是一貫的。看吧！三省失陷後，日本的野心，還不能滿足，更進而侵略淞滬。淞滬之役不得逞，乃轉而佔奪熱河。再以後，又屢次擾亂華北，圖謀華南。迨至近日，察東又告急了。日人之謀我，眞無所不用其極！</p>
<p>痛定思痛，國人今日紀念這一二八，應有一種覺悟。卽一二八的日子，雖已過去，但一二八的慘禍，却隨時隨地有重演的危險。不久以前，日本駐滬海陸軍，不是又在北四川路及南京路一帶，舉行一個大規模的武裝演習嗎？當時出動的兵員，約有二三千。機關槍鐵甲車坦克車，應有齊有。一時頗驚動全上海市的居民。這是幹什麽呢？是示威給我們上海民衆看呀！當日的晚報及隔天的日報記載此事，皆用大字的標題標出。有一家報紙的題目，很驚心觸日，這樣寫着：「當日慘象重現於今日。」</p>
<p>「當日慘象重現於今日事」是未必不可能的事！全國民氣若再這樣消沈下去，不猛醒振作，前途眞危險哩！</p>
<h3 id="c270">踏上新加坡 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 僑生</p>
<p>「新加坡！瞧哪；海岸邊有着那麽高大的房子，有着靑蛙似的爬着的汽車，有着螞蟻般的人羣，：：：」站在甲板上，我的朋友Ｓ孩子氣地呌着，而我可注意到一去大不列顚帝國的旗幟挿在一座，摩天樓上，被帶着海味的風吹盪着，在夕陽裏顯得分外的驕傲。那麽楞可似地站在那裏瞧了大半天，太古輪船公司的ＸＸ號已經停了，抛下了錨，汽笛子嗚嗚地高呌了兩聲，猛地給摧醒過來，咦！「上岸呀！新加坡已經到了！」Ｓ提着他那簡單的行李，我也提着我的，一前一後地上了岸。</p>
<p>岸邊擠着旅館的掮客，一齊向我們衝過來，高喊着他們的旅館名字。我們雖然不熟稔，却早聽說過「南天」是最大，最好的一家。於是當聽到「南天大酒店！南天｜」喊過來的當兒，便讓那個有馬來人的面孔的中國人點清了我們的行李也坐了車子到南天大酒店來。</p>
<p>很快地，夜色一塊烏布那麽地掛了起來。</p>
<p>和每一個大都市一樣，新加坡到了夜裏是會活躍起來的。不是麽？南天酒店的每一層的房間裏都是活躍的。麻將，妇人，酒，烟：：：交織而成的南天的靈魂呵。隔鄰是一家出演着有名的京劇的舞台，從那裏經過可以聽到鬧雜的鑼鼓聲音。街上；汽車，電車，羅里車，風似地吹了過去，落後的是人力車和牛車了。電影廣各用最奪目的形式出現在街頭，Ｃａｏｕｔａｋ映着希佛萊的片子！Ａｌａｍｂｒａ映着嘉寳的片子！｜｜｜女人的偶希佛萊和男人的對象嘉寳，都在新加坡毫不留情地奪取他們的觀衆。而我，「看電影去吧！」那麽地對Ｓ說了，就呌了人力車到Ｃａｐｉｔａｌ去。</p>
<p>寬暢的馬路，遊盪着無數的人羣。播音機在百貨公司的門外傳送着阿美利亞黑人最擅長的曲子。夜報卻記載着歐羅巴的動亂和世界第二次大戰的來臨。｜｜現在，新加坡的軍港早在大不列顚帝國慘淡經營之下完成了；大戰到來的一天，這馬來半島唯一的大都會得遭到怎麽一種命運呵！</p>
<p>半夜，從希佛萊的笑聲裏回到南天的五層樓上已經安息了兩個鐘頭，Ｓ早睡着啦。我推開窗子，呼了口氣，抬起頭、滿天的繁星像無數的眼球子似地發着亮。偶然低下視綫，却看到冷清清的街頭有幾輛人力車嬾散地在走着。在舖着摩天樓的陰影的角落裏，卻有背靠着壁站在那裏的出賣肉體的女人。｜｜｜哦！新加坡給予我的印象是多麽的可怕</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>！還有兇惡的印度警察，成夜巡邏於街上，監視着每一個失業者的行動：：：</p>
<p>踏上新加坡之岸，我只覺得大都會的可怕，一種不能自制的颤抖使我整夜失眼，直到第二天的太陽光照在床前，Ｓ醒來以後，驚奇地問我：「没有睡過嗎？」我可太息起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c271">夜泊 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 三郎</p>
<p>是午夜的時分，黑漆的天空里躱着那麽廣闊的黑雲，那疏遠的小星兒像是凄凉地流淚的在閃盪，海面狂暴的風，深深地顯現在南國的冬夜有一點兒寒凉，當火船剛剛從大海面駛進廣海灣的當兒，全船的旅客們紛紛地擾動，站在艙口，很當心地看着行李，一邊兒迎着狂暴的風煽動了自家兒底心頭。</p>
<p>好大風的夜哪！我是那魔地太息着，那時，幾隻駁渡的蛋婦人拚命地擋着巨浪，把渡子掉到火船的艙門前。每個人都　着巨大的風和飛着的絲雨，跳落那小小的渡子上去了。</p>
<p>我坐的位置是在艇的旁邊，所以，那浪花在黑夜裏飄出銀白色的，一朶朶地，沙沙地｜｜那麽好看的浪花呵！</p>
<p>我瞧着這樣的奇景的時候，不知不覺已給浪花飄濕了我的臉兒和衣裳，迎着飄飄的絲雨夾着的海風，更感到寒凉，身子漸漸兒顫抖着了。</p>
<p>大約半點鐘的時間，我們的渡子泊了石板岸邊，我跳上了碼頭，那兒已高高地吊着淡黄的電燈光，可以清清楚楚地瞧見那些挑夫們的兜攬生意，那些擾雜的聲音，我感到深深的異地情調的可怕來。</p>
<p>｜｜先生｜喂｜到廣海灣去還是廣海城？</p>
<p>幾個挑夫挨着寒冷，伸伸縮縮地圍着我。我的心里早就打算呌一個挑夫帶路的。這黑夜里，異地的路途總是可怕的。同時我又暗暗地害怕那些流氓的鬼計，因爲廣海城早幾年是賊的世界的。</p>
<p>｜｜喂！廣海灣的廣源隆可曉得嗎？</p>
<p>｜｜曉得，是陳老先生新落成的店舖啦。我帶你去。</p>
<p>好個三十多歲的男子便挑着我的東西，呌我跟着跑了。經過了一座牌門，便折進高山峯上的小道。那時，什麽都看不見，只是一些猙獰的山石在我的眼睛里動着。没有人行，没有聲息，我吃了一驚地｜｜難道帶我到賊窠去嗎？</p>
<p>那麽艱難的，經過了幾個灣曲的凸　的路，和到了那殘破的街上，一條長長的石街。遠望過去是一些新的房子，很漂亮的都市建築產，也還在熱鬧的夜市聲里呢。那麽地，我才安心没有給賊綁了去的。</p>
<p>到了我的朋友的家，我才感到廣海灣泊頭的前後的神妙來。</p>
<p>｜｜是一個美麗的海濱的小都市呢。</p>
<h3 id="c272">流浪人的滋味 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 浪人</p>
<p>我深深地嘗味著流浪人的滋味：｜</p>
<p>乘著巨大的海輪在僑民呌做七洲洋的大海上漂流，看月光在浩蕩的狂濤上浮沈；駕着一葉馬來小舟在蘇門答臘的溪港間浮泛，看熱帶的森林罩住空曠的叢林底兩岸；騎着一只脚踏車在馬來的原野上迂迴，看熱帶的赤土在炎炎的太陽下激起了塵烟。：：：</p>
<p>在中國，我踏上了香港的太平山峯，望着那對岸的灰黯的故國；在古老的中國靈魂所寄託着的有名的蘇，杭，我深味着這古國的封建味；在罪惡的都市上海，我在都市的黑暗的角落里觀察着淪落人的靈魂；而在我的故鄉，我被窒息在古國的黑暗的巨掌之下。：：：</p>
<p>每當靜夜，在寂寞咬　着心的深處的時候，我常常回味着那過去的流浪的滋味，一陣悵惘與愉快便潮過我的心頭。想着在一個混亂的世代里不住地在人潮間打滾，不住地在地球的一個角落里流浪，已屬是歷史所賦給我的命運。將來爲了要在人生的大道上掙扎，流浪和漂泊似乎總不會離棄我，一陣灰色的哀愁便蒙住了我的心。然而一想到在不住的流浪里看到了各種的人間的世相，從世界的每一個角落里拾得了這大地的智慧，將來如果有一天會從生的掙扎里看見人類的光明的面相，則這種痛苦的流浪豈不是命運賜給我的寳物？</p>
<p>想着有一次在蘇島的野林的巷道間涉着積雨的水窪渡了一個長途，在長長的四個鐘頭間踏在汚泥和水深没膝的野森林里。提心吊胆地害怕熱帶巨大的野　會出來咬人，聽着野禽在黑𩲢魃的樹叢間怪呌；一步一步地把足陷在爛泥里又出力拔起來，拔起來又復跌進去，眼着着落日已近黄昏　而茫茫的巨道還看不見人影，（除了我們自已的夥伴之外。）那時的焦急和困苦是怎樣熬煞人！然而現在的回味又怎樣地令人愉快！想着如果没有了這次的跋涉，不但那時的生活没得解决，便是以後的對赤道國土的深刻的了解和愛戀，怎麽會在我的一生上刻上了深刻的痕蹟？</p>
<p>又想着有一次和一個靑年夥友駕着一只馬來小舟去趕一個墟市。在限定的時間内趁着急流急驟奔馳。在一段窄窄的河道間突然一棵野林的大樹從岸旁倒下來，薜震的像山崩地陷般的横落在我</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>們小舟的跟前。那時小舟受着樹的椏枝的挑撥·險些兒被翻落入河道。虧得掌舵的夥友熟識御舟術，用着一臂的大力把小舟掙住。待鎭靜着嚇慌的魂魄和用着隨身帶來的鋸子鋸去粗大的樹幹的一段之後·便流了一身大汗·讓舟從鋸斷的樹隙里通過·我們總算脫離了險境。然而事後一想到設或那時的小舟稍稍前進一步、則二個年靑的生命豈不要被壓死在那樹幹底下？這怵目驚心的故事使我想起來都覺心跳·而事前朋友的阻我做此行的却使我事後都不會反悔。因爲没有此行我怎麽能够深入蠻荒？没有此行我怎麽能够看見南洋土人的更原始的面相？没有此行我怎麽能够對於那次所得的智識覺到滿心的歡悅？</p>
<p>在中國·由流流所給我的好處也不算少。在蘇州的茶館子裏，我可以看見悠久的帮國的古魂：在南中國的珠江浪潮上，我可以看見一個民族的英魂從壯揚以至消沈：從資本主義的都市上海、我可以看見由帝國主義所給帶來的黑暗的面相。：：：</p>
<p>在靜靜的黑夜裏我細數着過去的流浪所给我的快樂和痛苦，一陣生的矛盾的感覺便錯綜地交織在我的心頭。曾經靜靜地想：如果這社會能給以合理的調整、則將來在世界上流浪和工作，那光明而快樂的鮮明味將使我永沈浸在裏頭。抺去了黑暗面，而來了向上性，流浪將成爲男一種味道，我也將歌頌起流浪人底隨時隨地的工作來了！</p>
<p>讓流浪人的滋味從交織着快樂和痛苦的網裏而渡到唯一的快樂，從交織着黑暗和光明的兩面相而渡到唯一的光明的方向去吧！抛棄着生的流浪的苦惱，把面向着未來吧！</p>

<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>你相信不相信，喬治賴甫脫（ＧｅｏｒｇｅＲａｆｔ）曾經化了三千五百美金。做了一套禮服？但那却是事實。你且聽我講來。</p>
<p>那是喬治賴甫低微的時候，在紐約的一椿逸聞，很少人知道、。現在才有一位老朋友，替他說了出來。他現在闊了，穿得整整齊齊的，由他的化裝室裏走了出來。他身上穿的是晚餐服，他遇見了那位老朋友，就指着他自已的衣服，問着他道；「你看看，景緻如何？不錯吧，唉？」那位朋友慢吞吞地說道；「唔，不錯。但是，你還記得那套三千五百塊錢買來的嗎？」等喬治走開了，那位朋友就將三千五百塊錢的故事，講了出來。</p>
<p>好幾年以前，喬治在紐約一家德克斯昆娜夜總會跳舞的時候，他在一度辛苦工作之後，告了兩個星期的假，想休息一下子。他在休息的第一晚，跑到一個五十六街的一個柯克里賭塲。骰子是他自已選擇的。他那時並不算闊，所以下的注，當然是很小的，而是很小心的。但是那天，正是賭神菩薩收徒弟的日了。喬治賴甫脫賭星高照，一個鐘頭完結，他已經贏了三千五百塊。那是他生平没有贏過那許多錢的。他一時興發，就問他旁邊的一位朋友，就是現在講這段故事的朋友：「今天晚上到倫敦去的船，什麽时候開？」他說：「十二點」。喬治又問道：「現在什麽時候？」他說：「十點半」。喬治連忙將一大捲花花綠綠的紙，望衣服口袋裏一塞，拉着他的朋友，往外就跑。他說：「我今晚到倫敦去，有要緊的公事！」</p>
<p>閒言少叙，喬治果然坐了那船到倫敦去了。他爲什麽跋涉重洋，到英國倫敦去的理由，亦是喬治自已回到紐約之後、才講出來的。他說：</p>
<p>「我有一個怪癖，就是喜歡穿得講究。那個怪癖那裏來的呢？我來講給你們聽了吧。那時我在紐約各處夜總會裏跳着舞。德克斯昆娜給了我一個事做。她叫我去見她。我没有去過什麽上等的夜總會，所以亦不知道那裏的内容。我就竭力打扮着我自已，穿上我以爲最漂亮的行頭｜就是紫色的襯衫，加上一條煊紅的領帶。</p>
<p>「等到我走進了那總會，我四面一年，大家穿的都是晚餐服，雪白的硬襯衫。我頓時覺得自已的臉上，飛紅滾燙起來。那條紅領結，差不多在我紫色的襯衫上，燒了一個大窟　。我四面張望了一下，尋着了最近的一個出口，亦不去見德克斯昆娜，就急速地溜了出來。從此以後，我才知道穿衣服，怎樣叫做上等。從此以後，我就得了這個講究穿衣服的怪癖。</p>
<p>「後來，我又得到了穿晚餐服的脾氣。每天晚上，非穿上體服不敢見人。那時我惟一的野」</p>
<p>心，就是要穿一套金錢所能買得到的，最講究的禮服。那天晚上，在賭塲裏憑空贏了三千五百塊錢，我想我大概一時高興，發了神經病，立刻想起了英國倫敦，是著名做大禮服的地方，所以就想到倫敦去，素性做他一套最講究的禮服。</p>
<p>「我就坐了那條船，到了倫敦，在最有名氣的　　郝同冠蒂斯服裝店定做一套大禮服。」</p>
<p>當然，一套禮服决用不了那許多錢的。但　等到我回到紐約的時候，却已兩手空空，不名一文了。</p>
<p>「在我坐船回來的時候，在船上我又贏了些打彈子的東道。等到船開出　散姆頓的那天，我數了一數我的錢，已經少了一段，但是還有整整的兩千塊，還有一套簇新的大禮服。我自已想，手氣旣是那麽好，不如大賭它一下。我就加入了一次撲克的賭局。不想這次糟了，遇見了老鬼了。他們給了我一個大大的敎訓。等到我到了紐約，上了岸，我已經成了一個窮光蛋了。</p>
<p>「但亦不盡然。我以爲自已是個窮光蛋，但是過了些時，我在那套禮服的馬中口袋裏，又摸出一個十元的小金幣出來。那亦是我頭一次在柯克生賭塲贏來的錢。」</p>

<h3 id="c278">評「今古奇觀」 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＬｒｅＷｅｃｉｖｉｌｉｚｅｄ｜大光明</p>
<p>我幾乎不能不向續者諸君承認，我給這「我們文明嗎？」深深的感動？雖然這裏還包含着好些缺點。（至於爲什麽便將原名譯成「今古奇觀」的？那是不會理解的。）</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的殘酷，給與了歐美各國人民留下極慘痛的回憶。大戰毁滅了他們的家，大戰將世界變爲墳地，戰爭毁滅了人類的文明，於是從　大戰之後不久，一直到現在爲止，我們看了很多的關於世界大戰的影片，而具其中有不少反對帝國主義戰爭的名片。很顯然的，進步的，人道主義的電影作家們，他們厭惡戰爭，他們反對戰爭，這些都在他們的作品中表現出來。</p>
<p>現在第一次大戰二十年後的今日，第二次世界大戰又在一觸即發的當中。各帝國主義國家軍備的擴張，表現着他們之間的矛盾，非從戰爭中不能得着所謂解决。這些，在美國正羲感的電影作家中是看到了的，而且在作品中表現着他們的憂慮。關於這一方面，我們可以舉出「氣壯山河」（ＴｈｅＷｏｒｌｄＭｏｖｒｄｏｎ）作爲例證，雖然其中將爲了人類生活的向上而加强防衛的武裝之鞏固，和帝國主義之擴充軍備同一估價未免是作品的缺點。現在我們又看到愛德文卡維（ＥｄｖｉｎＣａｒｅｗｅ）的這一反對第二次大戰的影片了。</p>
<p>那末，我們來看他是怎樣認識戰爭的眞義？他是以什麽樣的態度來反戰的？從這一方面來給與作品適當的評價。在這裏，作者是正義感的人道主義的爲和平而呼籲。他說明人類的進步，由野蠻以至於文明。而就因爲這文明釀成了第一次大戰，這大戰却又毁滅了世界的文明。現在這野蠻的第二次大戰又將到臨，於是作者便化裝了一個學者向窮兵讀武的人們說敎，苦口婆心，雖以身殉亦在所不惜，結果學者總角之交的朋友，掌握軍政大權的將軍，也給他感動了。然而這正是作品的缺點，大戰的爆發，决不是少數好武的人們可以製造起來，因此，這裏向軍官們說敎並不能消弭戰爭的。更一進步說，帝國主義之間的所謂和平，卽是戰爭的準備，而眞正的和平，祇有從新與舊的戰爭中以消滅帝國主義戰爭，才能獲得。所以，世界大戰是反進步的，是文明人的野蠻行動，而消滅阻碍進步的戰爭的戰爭，乃是我們所需要的。</p>
<p>關於這些，作品中没有明確的指示，這正說明愛德文卡維還停止在舊的世界觀中。因而，說這是一部比較現實的作品，但不是批判的地深入到現實的本質。</p>
<p>如上述，也許是對作者過於苛求，退一步說，在第二次大戰的前夜，有如此正義感的反戰作品在美國出現，使我們覺得甚爲欣慰，至少作者的態度乃是十分嚴肅的。很明白的事實，作者完全爲了說明自已的意思而採取了非常樸質的手法表現出來，所以在技術上我們儘可以指出許多缺點，但這决不是作品致命的損害，主要的是在形式不够表現之外，在内容方面還有若干錯誤存在。</p>

<p>ＤｏｗｎｔｏＴｈｅｉｒＬａｓｔＹａｃｈｔ｜大上海映</p>
<p>交際花妮拉買了破落户少女玲黛家僅有的一艘舊游艇，邀請許多達官貴婦，富商鉅賈往南海去游覽。</p>
<p>玲黛爲了维持生活，仍在船上充當僕役。她的情人福勃斯因請求同去，遭受拒絕，就和他的隨身僕人佛萊迪設法躱在船上跟了去。</p>
<p>船主打算掠奪全體乘客的財寳，有意把船擱了淺，到一個孤島上去和女王計劃搶刦的陰謀。誰知女王却並不頹罕金錢財寳，只缺少着美男子。於是在所有來避難的水手與乘客中間，愛上了福勃斯這小白臉，要他做丈夫，做國王。她不管福勃斯已否和誰有了婚約，便命令全島的土人，大開結婚與禪位的慶祝宴。突如其來的，在樂隊之外，見了一個吹銅號的男子，說是像她的丈夫，就抛開了福勃斯拼命地愛他。</p>
<p>船被女王游戲地炸毁了，所有的人就此全留在荒島上，過他們歌舞，戀愛，任性縱慾的生活。</p>
<p>支架在玉褪，酥胸，酣歌，浪舞，熱戀，狂吻之下的這一類的故事，我們對於它是不能作什麽較有意義的企求的。一般脆弱的幻滅的人們，對於自已的生活失望到連自已都不能信任的當兒，拼命地作着死前的歡笑。幻想又幻想，還有什麽荒唐，怪誔與狂妄的事兒想不出來呢｜</p>
<p>爲了躱避現實而現實却給了這些享樂者以更正面的顯示，幻想却永遠破滅着。這「香悄海」無論怎樣的努力來掙扎，終不免沾染着前期同型片的氣息。原始的性的愛慕，由急遽，獷悍，清新，與瀟洒的追求，衰退到飄忽，柔弱，陳舊，浮泛與澀膩的憧憬了。</p>
<p>從處理的手法到表現出的調子，氛圍都如上面所述，不但船上生活的大段演出嫌平淡，連到了荒島後的種種也殊不够味兒。比如船舷上站着一羣高貴華麗的人們看着岸畔樹幹下那羣裸男的唱歌。那一塲，畫面上竟那麽呆板得直到冗長的歌唱完才有些變化。女王性感的表現不能與動作做到很好的統一。土人與避難者間的動蕩，各别地，零碎地，在畫面上缺少潑瀉的開朗的大景子，以及在旋律間缺乏之氣魄的洪韵等。</p>
<p>因着演出者努力集中於歌舞方面，以致演員間就不免少了過人的成绩。</p>

<p>黎莉莉的戀愛婚姻，却眞成了一個問題。起初在「小玩意」裏，她和羅朋戀愛在「秋扇明燈」裏，不是因爲羅朋個性的關係，差一點兒倆人就結了婚。如今在羅明佑朱石麟合導的「國風」裏呢：關於黎莉莉的戀愛，婚姻問題簡直曲折是更多了。原先莉莉鍾情於鄭君里，終於她是得到勝利，而與鄭君里结婚，但與鄭君里結婚不久，因爲環境的轉戀，莉莉也就隨之轉變了。雖然鄭君里後來因供給她讀書化用幾乎破產，可是她對於這事一點也不關懷。結果：鄭君里竟做了棄夫，莉莉和誰相愛了呢？到底還是與羅朋有緣。因爲他倆自合作戲以來，向是扮做相愛的角色，於是一般人都這樣說：「莉莉與小羅倒可稱爲一對影壇的情人呢」</p>

<p>金田村外，懸了白布横旗，上面寫着歡迎韋昌輝先生，許多小旗，和屋檐下掛的燈籠，也寫着同樣字句，韋昌輝坐在馬上，左右顧盼，石達開隨在後面，把馬趕上一步，向前指着說：「韋大哥！前面立在村口的，就是洪秀全楊秀清幾位了」，韋即向前看去，說道：「這樣重的禮節，眞是不敢當啊」。到了村前，韋等即行下馬。洪秀全上前相迎，執禮甚恭，號砲三聲，鼓樂大作，在這歡呼熱烈聲中，迎接入内。廳中設立了宴席，韋昌輝中坐，洪楊曾石以次均在陪坐。洪秀全斟上酒來，執杯在手，向韋說道：「今天承蒙韋先生不以我們微賤，加入我們這會，這眞是無上的榮幸，實足以鼓勵我們奮鬥的意志，說着，把杯舉起說：「大家同飲這杯酒，敬祝韋先生康健」，說着大家立起，一飲而盡，韋飲了一杯之後，含着笑意，回答說：一多蒙諸位這樣厚待，實在不收當，我是一個平常用的人，本也想做點事業，可没有機緣，現在得加入貴會，這眞是我發奮有爲的時候，只要諸位兄長的使命，是我能力所能及的，我無不竭盡力量去做到的」。席上諸人，凝神聽着，聽到最後的說話，一齊鼓起掌來，舉起杯兒飲酒。這時庭院中擠滿了人們，院中耍　舞各種燈彩雜要等等。戲臺上還演着京劇，一番熱鬧，暫且按下不提。</p>
<p>却說一天大家正在金田村内坐着閒談，忽然一然一匹馬飛奔而來，至村口下馬，却是秦日綱，神色倉后皇，飛步入内，衆人見秦奔了進來，都很驚愕，秦日綱神經錯亂，話都說不清：「不好了！洪秀全大哥被桂平縣衙門裏捉去了」，幾個人驚駭的立了起來，問說：「怎樣的」？韋和曾也立起問說：「怎麽會的」！秦日綱喘氣說：「我陪着洪大哥到縣裏辦一點事情，縣裏有個差人，是從廣東來的，見了洪大哥，就去報了官，說洪大哥在花縣犯了案，宣傳耶穌敎，謀反朝廷，縣裏就派了差人，跟到半路上，把洪大哥抓去了」。蕭朝貴聽了這般說話，勃然大怒道：「」這個瘟官，敢替我們作對，我們趕快殺進城去，救大哥出來」，說着，氣憤憤地，洪宣嬌也喊着：「我們今天就殺進城去」。楊秀清馮雲山聽了，都很悉慮，楊微微搖頭說：「現在我們還没有到起事的時候，不能就輕易宣露出去，」秦日綱在旁忙喊着說：「不能就讓洪大哥陷在牢裏不出來」，韋昌輝於是對大家說：「我倒有點計較，不知諸位能否贊成，我知道桂平縣知縣是個貪官，如果多用些賄賂，我能保定洪大哥安然回來」，曾王珩聽了接着說：「照這個辦法，最爲穏妥，如果實在辦不成！我們再照蕭大哥的說話就是了，」韋昌輝於是向衆人拱拱乎說：「事不宜遲，我立刻進城去辦這件事」。衆人送韋昌輝出來，韋對衆人說：「諸位坐聽好消息吧」！說了上馬而去，果然錢能通神，洪秀全得了韋昌輝的營救，從桂平縣釋放出來，洪秀全對着大衆說：「這次幸而有韋先生搭救，不然眞要遭他們的毒手，不過我想官廳遲早要找到我們頭上來的，我們倒要决心預備」。那蕭朝貴聽了搶前一步說：「我們應該殺了出去，奪了桂平城，誰耐煩在這裏受這種悶氣」。馮雲山楊秀清說道：「事情當然不容我們遲緩了，現在糧餉已經有了着落，祇要等四方豪傑，聯絡好了，就可以一鼓起來了。」洪秀全曾玉珩聽說，點頭稱是，未後說道：「現在祇有加緊訓練士卒，責成達開日綱朝貴三位負責，不得怠慢」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Negotiations for the Chahar East Incident Location Still Undecided <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Japan Proposes Datan, We Insist on Zhangjiakou or Ping, Takahashi to Consult Before Finalizing</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Troops' Transport Concludes</p>
<p>(Beiping) Preliminary discussions on the Chahar East issue were held yesterday by Zhu Shikqin, Yue Kaixian, Takahashi, and Matsui. The Japanese side proposed holding the meeting in Datan, while the Chinese side advocated conducting negotiations in Ping (Beiping) or Zhangjiakou. According to Takahashi, holding the meeting in Zhangjiakou was not out of the question, and he has telegraphed the Kwantung Army headquarters in Changchun for instructions. After receiving a reply within the next few days, the Chinese military and political committees will each send one representative, together with representatives from the 29th Army, to negotiate with the other side. Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying went to Juren Hall this morning at 11:00 to meet with He (Yingqin), seeking instructions on how to handle the Chahar East incident. After the incident occurred, the Chahar Provincial Government has repeatedly telegraphed the central government with detailed reports. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chahar East remained calm and uneventful on the 27th. Out of respect for peace, our army has consistently maintained a firm and patient attitude, without adding a single soldier to Chahar East. If the Japanese army does not advance further, the situation will not escalate. During the embassy's peace talks on the 26th, the Japanese side requested that the meeting be held in Datan or Gubeikou, while the Chinese side insisted on Beiping or Zhangjiakou. In the end, it was decided that the Japanese military attaché Takahashi would telegraph the Kwantung Army for instructions. A reply is expected in two or three days, at which time the discussions will continue. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Chief of Staff Sakai told reporters that China and Japan are discussing ways to resolve the Chahar East incident, and it will not escalate. The Japanese army has now been ordered to stop advancing and has no intention of occupying Chahar. As for the meeting location, the Japanese side initially proposed Datan, but because the Chinese side advocated for Beiping, the future location will likely be more inclined towards Beiping. The Japanese side has already designated Matsui as their representative. Matsui has flown to Rehe to meet with Commander Sugihara for instructions. Discussions will begin as soon as Matsui returns to Beiping. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Lianggu Brigade of the Japanese army advanced to Xiaochang and Nanweizi, five li from Dushikou, this afternoon, while the puppet army cavalry advanced to Hongnitan, two li from Dongzhaizi. There were no actions taken by either side. A Zhangjiakou telegram stated that the people here are calm, the markets are as usual, and residents have no intention of fleeing in panic. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Zhangjiakou telegram stated that a detachment of the Japanese army's Nagami unit stationed yesterday in Xiaochangzi, west of Wuni River, and used a small number of troops with machine guns to attack our police at Wunitan. Currently, the majority of the Nagami unit is on the high ground four kilometers northwest of Wunitan. Fourteen Japanese planes from Chengde have arrived in Datan. In the past two days, Japanese planes have frequently flown reconnaissance missions over the Great Wall line of Guyuan and Dushikou, but have not yet dropped bombs. Forty members of the Japanese Self-Defense Corps arrived in Changliang yesterday, and another eighteen arrived today. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun and Zhang Weifan telegraphed Ping on the 27th stating that there was no activity by Japanese and puppet troops on the Chahar-Rehe border, and the area was calm. A Japanese reconnaissance plane flew to Guyuan at 9:00 AM on the 26th, circled, and then flew south to the areas of Chicheng and Dushikou for reconnaissance. Residents were panicked.

<p>Mongolian Authorities Explain the Truth of the Conflict</p>
<p>(Moscow) In recent days, foreign newspapers have widely reported that Soviet and Japanese-Manchukuo troops clashed near Lake Buir. TASS is now instructed to declare that this news is purely contradictory and malicious fabrication. Lake Buir is located on the border between the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchukuo, about 200 kilometers from the Soviet border. There are no and can never be Soviet troops in that area, which is very clear. The report also claimed that the Mongolian troops involved in the border dispute with the Japanese army were commanded by a Soviet Red Army officer, which is also malicious fabrication. There are no Soviet officers commanding the Mongolian national army. The report also stated that Soviet aircraft crossed into Manchukuo territory and bombed villages near Hailar, which is also arbitrary fabrication. Well-informed sources in Moscow believe that such sensational rumors are the tricks of those who dream of causing war in the Far East, as they are counting on such a war to break out soon. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Kulun All newspapers have reported that on the 24th of this month, border troops of the Mongolian People's Republic invaded Manchukuo territory near Lake Buir and attacked the Manchukuo army. Genden, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian Republic, stated that such news is completely inconsistent with the facts. The truth is as follows: at 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month, Mongolian border troops saw 17 armed personnel invading Mongolian territory from Manchukuo territory, near Khalha-gol Sum, 2 kilometers from the border. Dundub, the commander of the Mongolian border troops, immediately stepped forward to identify them. These armed personnel invading the border attempted to seize the commander, and Dundub resisted, resulting in serious injuries and death. A skirmish then broke out, with both sides suffering losses. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic immediately dispatched responsible officials to the scene of the incident to investigate. Genden concluded that Khalha-gol Sum has always belonged to the Khalha Mongols who live there. Since 1921, the area has been part of the Mongolian Republic. The border markers established there have never been changed since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Director of the Postal Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the 27th. According to him, the Savings and Remittance Bureau originally had two systems, savings books and postal savings stamps. It added three types: checking accounts, regular small deposits, and interest-bearing fixed deposits. The savings business has been promoted year by year, and the number of savings and remittance bureaus has increased to more than 600. The total amount of savings nationwide is now about 36 million yuan, of which savings book savings account for the majority, about 20 million yuan. Postal remittances have always been the main channel for small remittances under 100 or 200 yuan domestically. Other remittance businesses are also developing, but the remittance fees are higher than those of ordinary banks. In order to compete for business, the Bureau halved domestic remittance fees after its establishment. As for international remittances, because exchange rates change at any time, good methods are being planned. Currently, the total amount of savings is 36 million yuan. The total amount of investment in various industries and various loans is only over 20 million yuan. The preparation of funds is required to be above 40 percent. Regarding the issue of loans to rural areas, it has been planned and is now planned to be piloted in Hunan first and can be implemented in the spring and then promoted in the future. The postal conference of the Ministry of Communications passed nine items related to postal remittances, which are to be handled and improved by the Bureau. The small money order that is currently planned to be created will be for a minimum of 5 yuan and a maximum of 20 yuan. It will be remitted uniformly throughout the country and will not be attached to the stub, which is very convenient and profitable. It will be implemented on March 1 this year. Regarding the payment of interest on savings, a unified method is being planned. The Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to prepare for postal simple life insurance. A special committee was set up to study the plan two years ago and drafted a draft that is being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and will soon be passed. It is planned to open on July 1 this year. The Bureau has been ordered to move to Beijing for office work. However, the various procedures that must be handled near the banks are difficult to complete for a while. It will be difficult to implement next month. After the relocation, a branch bureau will be set up in Shanghai. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Reflections and Commemoration of "January 28th" <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>What day is today? It is the third anniversary of "January 28th." If we recall the cruelty of the battle in Zhabei on that day, the devastation of the area, and the enormous loss of life and property, I know that anyone with blood in their veins will feel resentment and grief. However, in the three years since then, grief is still grief, and resentment is still resentment. But what has been the effect? Has the lost Northeast been recovered because of our resentment? Have the Japanese policies changed because of our resentment? Neither has happened. As for the various material and spiritual developments in our country, have they made rapid progress because of our resentment? Also, no. Therefore, resentment alone is not enough to repel the enemy externally, nor is it enough to build the country internally. If today's commemoration is still aimed at stirring up enthusiasm and only results in resentment, then this commemoration is superfluous.</p>
<p>Every country in the world has its own reasons for its prosperity, decline, strength, and weakness. If we ignore the reasons for its prosperity, strength, decline, and weakness, and only rely on temporary enthusiasm and fleeting emotions, then the matter will pass and be forgotten. It will not only fail to help in practice but will also hinder the overall national plan. Therefore, what the people of the country should pay the most attention to today is examining their own weaknesses and then correcting them. From our observation, the weaknesses of the people of the country can be summarized in the following ways. In addition to being easily swayed by emotions and lacking rational thinking, one is reliance. One's own strength is insufficient for self-defense. Logically, one should first start by strengthening the country, but most people still hope for external assistance. Some place their hopes on the United States, some place their hopes on the United Kingdom, and some even place their hopes on Soviet Russia. Little do they know that although the UK, the US, and Soviet Russia may have actions that displease Japan, they all have special positions and many interests at stake when it comes to dealing with Japan. They will not rashly come to help. The second is pessimism. They believe that the national situation is hopeless, so they are disappointed and commit suicide, or they become depraved and indulge in pleasure, or they cultivate personal virtue and seek personal gain. No matter how passive they are, their abandonment of themselves will not help the country. The third is shirking responsibility. The people often attribute the responsibility for the national crisis to the government, while the government, due to differing opinions, blames each other. The government, the people, and all parties should bear considerable responsibility for this national crisis. The national disaster is everyone's responsibility. If everyone can be motivated, the country will naturally become strong. And if the country becomes strong, the government will also be strong. The fourth is the lack of a national concept. In the midst of foreign invasion, every country immediately abandons the selfishness of parties and individuals to seek unity in resisting the enemy. Only China, even in the face of such a major national crisis, is not shocked to eliminate its disagreements and harmonize its spirit. It is appropriate to say that there is a lack of a national concept. The fifth is being good at discussion and fantasy. The people of the country are never inferior to others in terms of discussion and writing when it comes to handling things and planning undertakings. However, in practice, many grand plans often stop at empty words and discussions, with little further action. If this is the case, what benefit can great plans have? The sixth is that young people lack the spirit of hard work and endurance. For example, young people in Japanese universities, regardless of gender, often supplement their tuition fees by delivering newspapers and milk. They never feel ashamed of their labor. This spirit of hard work, endurance, independence, and self-respect in order to serve the country in the future has been the case for twenty years. I ask, do the young people of our country have this spirit? The seventh is the lack of discipline in the foreign actions of the people. Our country has suffered many losses of rights and humiliations because of this. We have learned many lessons but have not yet awakened. Regardless of any country, even if they are dissatisfied with the policies of the authorities, there should be a distinction between the country and the individual. Therefore, what we should advocate is maintaining a spirit of self-respect towards foreigners, getting rid of our flamboyance, adopting a polite attitude, getting rid of our arrogance and conceit. If we can strictly discipline ourselves and act according to standards, then what opportunity will others have to exploit? The eighth is that there are too many illiterate people. The strength of national consciousness is proportional to education. The Saar plebiscite had this result because all nineteen received education. Finally, it is that the Chinese people are too selfish and self-interested. The difficulty in achieving national unity and the difficulty in achieving all undertakings are all due to this. If this is not removed, then nothing can be done, let alone the great cause of saving the country.</p>
<p>In short, the prosperity, decline, rise, and fall of a country are not without reason. If we have points that can lead to decline and fall, then even without enemy threats, we will perish. If not, then even surrounded by strong neighbors, we can stand in the world.</p>

<p>The Second World Economic Conference Will Be Held in Washington in September</p>
<p>(London) According to the political editor of the Sunday Chronicle, officials in London and Washington are currently discussing convening a second World Economic Conference. It is understood that representatives of the two countries have tentatively scheduled the meeting to be held in Washington in September this year. Stabilizing international finance, repaying war debts, and important issues such as sugar, wheat, and shipping will all be on the agenda of the meeting.

<p>(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce's monthly summary of China's commercial situation, the financial situation in Shanghai has now become much more stable than before. Last year, the import of silver bars and silver ingots to Hong Kong was worth a total of HK$3,573,000, of which HK$1,637,000 was imported from the United States. The total value of exports was HK$9,127,000, of which HK$5,288,000 was shipped to the United States. The import of silver coins was HK$43,956,000, almost all of which was imported from China, India, and Macau. The export of silver coins was HK$34,437,000, mostly shipped to England, the United States, and China. (National News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Calm the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>London Public Opinion Publishes Proposal</p>
<p>Lloyd George Deplores Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>Birmingham Former Prime Minister Lloyd George gave a speech here today, greatly supporting China, saying that he was very concerned about the situation in the Far East. The situation in that area is gradually making it impossible for the UK and the US to delay and hesitate any longer. He also said that he did not want to see Chinese territory swallowed up by wolves, resulting in Japan shrinking the country by hundreds of miles. This phenomenon must be stopped. (National News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Observer said in an editorial today regarding the situation in the Far East, strongly advocating the necessity of cooperation between the UK, the US, and Russia, saying that these three countries should have a solid understanding that does not harm Japan's existing position. Only in this way can the situation in the Far East be calmed and the deterioration of the situation prevented. If the arrogant extremists in Japan always believe that there is no force that can restrain their ambitions and that they can do whatever they want, then the situation will become increasingly worse. It is a pity that London and Washington have not clearly expressed their views on the necessity of establishing a practical defense agreement between the UK, the US, and the UK, US, and Russia. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Gang Xiaoluo, commander of the Soviet Russian Far Eastern Army, arrived today, accompanied by a detachment of the Far Eastern Army. After arriving, Gang Xiaoluo issued a declaration, stating that the power of the Soviet Russian Far Eastern Army is sufficient to resist any aggression in the Far East and has sufficient defense against enemies who can invade Soviet Russia in the Far East. Gang Xiaoluo's declaration came after Japan's recent military action in Chahar, so the diplomatic community is paying great attention to it. I have also received an important report that Tai Luofu, who was most effective in reorganizing the Far Eastern Army, has now been dismissed from the Red Army and transferred to other work. The reason has not been announced. Tai Luofu was very prestigious in General Galen's staff, and his sudden transfer has caused surprise among the general public. (National News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Former director of the Recovery Administration, General Johnson, strongly opposed the proposal for war-time state-owned enterprises to the House Military Committee today. Johnson said that if the national industry is nationalized in the next war, our country will definitely be defeated, because the next great war will be very intense, and all departments of the country should invigorate their spirits and work together. Johnson only advocated that the wartime government should control the industry and that the government should manufacture military goods in peacetime, but it still cannot forcibly requisition or nationalize the country's financial resources or industry, which is enough to disperse military power and lead to defeat.

<p>No Political Mission in China</p>
<p>Yokohama. Mr. Haas, Minister of Communications of the League of Nations, has now been appointed as Chairman of the Committee for Assistance to China, as the successor to Dr. Rajchman. This time, he is traveling on the Empress of Canada with his wife to take up his post, passing through Yokohama today. Haas served as secretary-general of the Lytton Commission two years ago, visiting the East once. Given the current situation, great attention is being paid to his words and deeds. According to what he said on the ship, he hurriedly departed from Geneva for China on December 26 last year. As for the various matters concerning China, the Council of the League of Nations has decided to provide technical assistance to the Chinese government. In addition, it does not contain any political mission. I once knew Vice Minister Shigemitsu. If I want to visit him, I may be able to meet him, but the League of Nations has not ordered me to visit the Japanese government. (Japanese Allied News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Haas, the chairman of the League of Nations Committee for Technical Assistance to China, originally planned to meet with Vice Minister Shigemitsu in Yokohama to exchange views on Chinese issues.

<p>(Tokyo) More than 30 members of the Seiyukai, including the Tokonami faction and Jintaro Ito and Heitaro Uehara, who advocated avoiding dissolution, gathered at the Aviation Hall in Shiba Ward from 6 PM on the 26th to exchange views on the following two items: ㈠ Recently, the actions of our party have been criticized by public opinion. The executives should clarify their responsibilities and not implicate our party and the president. ㈡ In view of the need for national unity, our party must dedicate itself to the country. As a result of the discussion, they all requested the nomination of mediators to expand the work. Regarding the bomb motion and the disciplinary issues of Tokonami's succession, the self-respecting faction has now moved to the surface. Therefore, some of the executives have expressed strong opinions such as seceding from the party at this time. The confrontation between the hard-line faction and the self-respecting faction within the Seiyukai is gradually intensifying, so its future is worthy of attention.

<p>Roosevelt Manages It Himself</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, President Roosevelt will personally manage the US$4 billion relief fund previously requested from Congress. The rumors that the president plans to set up another agency are clearly misrepresentations. It is said that this statement did not pay attention to what the president said in his message that the money should be given to him personally, and when the House passed the bill, it also stated that it should be given to the president "to be used in the most beneficial way for the country as the situation requires." Advisers close to the government believe that the president may convene his confidants to assist in this matter, but no decision has been made yet. At the same time, Republican senators in the Senate unanimously resolved to demand a public report in the Senate Appropriations Committee. (National News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) Leo K. Cabble, executive director of the Reconstruction Administration, said in a speech to the New York Bar Association today that when President Roosevelt took office, the country was on the verge of revolution. If the US courts' interpretation of the Constitution does not conform to the government's views on human rights, then there is still a danger of revolution. Therefore, he asked the nation's lawyers to cooperate with the government to fight the economic panic. Mr. Li also asked lawyers to interpret the Constitution in such a way that it could implement the principles of the "New Deal" and not argue with the government over political power. Mr. Li finally said that the spirit of the Constitution has been greatly damaged by lawyers attacking the reconstruction movement. Former US government legal adviser Saque asked Mr. Li, saying that the judiciary has been encroached upon by the executive. Mr. Li replied that the government must prevent material destruction and chaos, and its temporary privileges have always been recognized. (National News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski, German Forestry Director Gendel, Hunting Director Hosenfeld, and Military Attaché General Yachintler of the German Embassy in Poland also came with him. The flower car carrying Göring arrived at the central station here last night, strictly guarded by a large team of police. Because it was late at night, no one noticed. After a short stop, it drove to the East Station. After getting off the car, Göring went to the German Embassy for a rest and is scheduled to take a special train to Białowieża this afternoon with other guests. Every year, the Polish president hunts in the forest in that area, which has an area of 2,500 square kilometers and is considered the largest forest in Europe. The hunting ground is in its center, covering an area of 5,000 hectares. The last of Europe's rare bison live here, and there are also many lynxes and large wild boars. Emperor Alexander of Russia had a palace built in the forest, but he never came to live there during his reign. Now, President Mościcki will host two groups of guests in the palace. Göring is included in the second group, and his hunting days are set for the 28th and 29th. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>Warsaw. The German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was signed on January 26, 1934. Today marks its first anniversary. The semi-official Iskra News Agency published an article commenting that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact neither harms others nor opposes any other country. Since its signing, the good neighborly relations between Germany and Poland have been developing day by day. Whether this kind of good neighborly relation can last for a long time to create long-term stability will be indicated by future history. In short, the bilateral treaty is an excellent international political tool, more effective than various conventions and general and vague international guarantees. However, the "Daily News" said that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels came to Poland before, and there is also talk that Prussian Premier Göring will come to Poland, which shows that the improvement of German-Polish relations is valued more by Germany than by Poland, because the deterioration of relations between the two countries was originally the fault of Germany.

The French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will be accompanied by Diplomatic Secretary Silaire and Director of General Affairs of the Prime Minister's Office Gayère. In addition, French representative to the League of Nations Massigli may also accompany them. The date of departure is now set for January 31.

Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Laval cannot make any decisions to Henderson, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, regarding the date of reopening the Disarmament Conference for useful discussions. Therefore, the exchange of views between the British and French cabinet members will only be limited to the Rome Agreement, and only to those aspects of the Rome Agreement that are related to the UK and France. In addition, more important issues will be temporarily suspended and useful discussions can only be made after Germany expresses its attitude. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Inside German Politics <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency German Correspondent) I have lived in Germany for many years and am quite familiar with the situation in German political circles. Now I will briefly describe the measures of the new German government.</p>
<p>Hitler's victory over his political enemies has various aspects in Germany. If we make a comprehensive study of these situations, we can know that it is actually due to the transformation of the times, that is, the times themselves have matured. Since the Great War, German citizens have been governed by people around the age of fifty, and these people have repeatedly used the same political system in the same era.</p>
<p>If we study it, we can know that the administrative and economic policies of the various parties in the past reveal that the highest goal of the political figures at that time was to attack and destroy each other. Ebert, Eisberkel, Brou, Stresemann, Rathenau, and Luther all belonged to the political figures who participated in the political struggle of that era.</p>
<p>After this era, which lasted for twenty-five to forty-five years, the political system has not changed slightly. With the blood and sweat of Germany, war reparations were paid. No one could truly show their political talent in Germany. These political figures were only intent on being brave in political struggle, which led to cutting off their own way out, creating their own troubles, and creating their own troubles. After Bruning first formed the "Vanguard Cabinet," Hitler's voice began to become increasingly prominent. Therefore, all countries have a new perspective on Germany. At this point, those political figures who specialized in digging trenches for self-defense were forced to abandon their political desire to rule.</p>
<p>Today's leaders of the new German government are young and strong, twenty to thirty years younger than the government figures of the past. If we look at it from the perspective of age alone, we can know that the National Socialist political and cosmic ideal is completely different from the governments of various countries. The distinction is obvious. Only Italy's progress is similar to the situation in Germany. The vanguard of this era can make the country strong. France does not have it, and even the UK is far behind.</p>
<p>Today's Germany repeatedly proclaims its will for peace to the world. Today's German government is dedicated to peace in the midst of repeatedly calling for peace, because the German people themselves deeply feel the harm and benefit of war. Therefore, our call for peace is indeed the most true and just proof. Germany's bell of peace can only be heard by those who are dedicated to the scope of peaceful public undertakings. This bell is issued by the new German Third Reich in the midst of heavy diplomatic difficulties, with the psychological factor of liberating the European situation. Germany not only wishes to see France or the United Kingdom in peace, but also all the people of various countries who share this goal are happy to be friendly with it.</p>

<p>(London) England and Ireland continue to be battered by gales today. Many trees have been uprooted, and numerous utility poles have been snapped. British Columbia in Canada is also suffering from wind and snow, with fourteen deaths reported. The Fraser River has overflowed, leaving thousands homeless and drowning hundreds of cattle. This afternoon in Britain, strong winds, accompanied by snowflakes and hailstones, reached speeds of eighty-six miles per hour. According to the elderly, this is unprecedented. The damage inland is significant. Heavy snow fell in London and the northern and eastern districts today, blocking many roads. This evening, a gale struck Ilfracombe, Devon, with winds reaching ninety miles per hour, toppling houses and destroying many fishing boats, but there have been no reports of loss of life. Heroic acts of rescue have been reported during the storm. A doctor and a nurse braved the storm and traveled ten miles by boat to rescue an injured person on the Shetland Islands.

<p>(London) A Hillman Airways plane flying from Paris to London lost gold bars worth £6,000 en route. It is believed they fell into the sea off the coasts of Kent and Sussex. This afternoon, when the plane arrived at Aylesbury, it was discovered that the luggage compartment had been torn apart by the strong winds encountered en route, and other items were lost in addition to the gold bars.</p>

<p>Discuss Saar Post-Settlement</p>
<p>Basel Various economic and financial issues arising from the return of the Saar to Germany are currently being discussed at a conference here between German and French representatives. Today was the first meeting. The chairman is the French representative, Mr. Routh. The most important issue discussed today was the conversion of the French franc, currently circulating in the Saar region, to the mark. Other matters, such as tariffs, railways, coal mines, changes in administrative bodies, and various technical details, were also discussed, as well as the impact on private contracts and the responsibilities of the Saar Governing Commission. After the first meeting today, a joint communiqué was issued, stating that the delegates from Germany and France, along with the Saar Governing Commission and the League of Nations Financial Committee, had discussed the transfer of various administrative agencies in the Saar to the German authorities. It was the consensus that this issue was beyond the authority of those assembled in Basel and should be negotiated directly between the German government and the Saar Governing Commission. As for other matters within the authority of those assembled in Basel, committees have been formed to examine them separately. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) Randolph Churchill, son of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill, is running as an opposition Conservative candidate in the Warwick and Leamington by-election, competing with the mainstream Conservative candidate. As a result, there is a risk of division within the Conservative Party. Today, Conservative leader and Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin removed Randolph Churchill from his position within the party and issued a statement to the Conservative opposition, stating: "I deeply regret the disagreements within the Conservative Party caused by the India issue. However, the prosperity of Britain depends on the unity of the Conservative Party, and to maintain internal unity and prevent it from being undermined, all conflicts of opinion must be eliminated. This is what we all agree on. Now, if a candidate is put forward without the party's permission, the result will be a split in the Conservative vote, and the Labour Party will reap the benefits and win. If this happens, all our efforts will be in vain, and all future plans will be destroyed." Following this, Air Minister Londonderry declared, "These people are now trying to divide our party. If they succeed, our danger in the next general election will be very great. I am not saying that we will fail. However, if the National Unity Cabinet wants to implement the great plans we have, it must have a majority in Parliament. If our party is divided, it will be difficult to secure a majority in the next election." (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Chahar Eastern Incident <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Informal Talks Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Chinese Representatives: Zhu Shiqin and Yue Kaixian</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives: Matsui and Takahashi Tan</p>
<p>Beijing Communication: In the Chahar Eastern area, from 2:00 p.m. on the 24th (previous) to 6:00 p.m. on the 26th (present), the situation at the front line has been peaceful and uneventful. However, Japanese troops near Xifengkou near Dushikou and Datanzhen near Guyuan have been very busy increasing their deployments in recent days. According to a telephone call from Zhangjiakou, it has been determined that the Japanese troops in these two locations have increased by more than 1,600 men, and the number of armored vehicles has also increased to more than 70. In the Rehe-Western Dagakouzhen area, in addition to the Japanese army gathering more than 8,000 men and attaching a squadron of aircraft (nine aircraft), about 3,000 puppet troops under Zhang Haipeng, led by puppet Brigade Commander Wang Yongqing, are also deployed in Datanzhen and other places. Assessing the situation, the Japanese intentions towards Dushikou and Guyuan do not seem to have eased. Regarding the statement that the issue will be resolved through diplomatic means, although it has been widely broadcast today (26th), judging from the busy increase in Japanese troop deployments at the front line, whether a peaceful resolution can be achieved depends on whether the Japanese side has sincerity. Matsui, the Japanese Kwantung Army military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou who came to Beiping to negotiate peace, arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou at 9:30 a.m. today (26th). He told people at the station that the incident could be resolved peacefully. The Japanese attitude towards this matter is to determine the "Manchu" border with China. At this point, someone handed a map to Matsui for review and asked about the Rehe-Chahar provincial border, which was clearly marked. What is the basis for the Japanese claim that the Chahar Eastern areas belong to Rehe? Matsui replied that current maps cannot be compared with old maps. Don't you know about the "Manchurian Incident"? You are not up-to-date, and I suppose you have not seen the new maps. His words were extremely arrogant. When Matsui discussed the peaceful resolution, he stated that the Japanese side hoped that China would send representatives to Datanzhen for consultation. As for what will be discussed at the meeting, he said that since he is not directly responsible, it is difficult to predict. After getting off the train, Matsui went to the Japanese embassy to meet with Takahashi Tan. Around 10:00 a.m., Zhu Shiqin, a standing committee member of the War Zone Clearing Committee, and Yue Kaixian, the Special Foreign Affairs Commissioner of Chahar Province, went to the Japanese embassy to meet with Matsui. Takahashi Tan was also present. The meeting ended at 12:00 p.m. Matsui left Beiping at 1:15 p.m. to go to Tianjin to meet with Mezu Yoshijiro, commander of the Japanese North China Garrison Army, and Chief of Staff Sakai, to report on the situation. He is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou via Beiping next Thursday. It is reported that the Chinese side can generally send representatives to attend the peace talks. However, the selection of representatives is still under consideration, and there is a need to continue to negotiate with the Japanese side on the location of the meeting, as it should be in a convenient location. According to sources, during the informal talks between the Chinese and Japanese representatives this morning (26th), the Japanese side put forward two points: (1) The meeting location can be selected from Datanzhen, Gubeikou, and Chengde; (2) The Chinese side has not yet made any indication regarding the representatives attending the meeting. Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan and Committee Member Xiao Zhenying went to Jurentang this afternoon to meet with He Yingqin to report on the situation at the front line and listen to Zhu Shiqin and Yue Kaixian's report on their meeting with Takahashi and Matsui. Although there was some discussion on the spot, no specific decision was made because everything needed to be reported to the Central Government for instructions. The national army at the front line is determined to deal with the situation with patience. Unless the Japanese army engages in further oppression before the two sides officially negotiate a solution, the situation should not escalate, and a peaceful resolution is hoped for. The various foreign embassies in this country are paying close attention to the future of the incident and are inquiring about the truth from our relevant parties. According to well-informed sources, the formal talks between the two sides are scheduled to take place at the end of this month, but it is difficult to say for sure until the facts are materialized.

<h3 id="e68">Nanchang Headquarters Closes <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Suppression and Aftermath Handled by Pacification Headquarters</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: On January 29, 1933, Chairman Chiang came to Jiangxi from Nanjing to supervise the bandit suppression and established the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Committee, commanding the armies of the five provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Hunan to encircle and suppress Zhu Mao. After the start of the suppression, eastern Jiangxi and the interior areas were gradually recovered. However, there was the Shi Sun Incident in the northwest and the Chen Li uprising in Fujian. However, because the Red bandits could not be relaxed for a moment, the military affairs of the above areas were also under the control and dispatch of the Nanchang Headquarters. Suppressing bandits and rebellion were carried out simultaneously. For a time, the Nanchang Headquarters was the center of national military affairs and the general hub for restoring order. Chiang believed that the occurrence of bandit disasters and the recurrence of internal strife were mostly due to poor politics in the long run. Therefore, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government to grant full power to handle military affairs in the military area, in addition to using military means to treat the symptoms, he also vigorously implemented political improvements to treat the root causes. Therefore, the Second Department of the Headquarters carried out major reforms in the politics of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, especially with Jiangxi as the center for refreshing internal affairs. Therefore, for three years, Nanchang was not only a military center, but also the focus of national political attention. Since Chiang launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang last February, it has swept the country. The military, political, and new movements led by Chiang in Jiangxi have all made a distinction in an era of China's rejuvenation. In November last year, the bandit nest in southern Jiangxi and the Soviet areas of the puppet central government were razed to the ground. Only a few remnants of the bandits fled into Hunan and Guizhou. The bandit suppression military operations in Jiangxi Province were completely over. When Chiang entered Nanjing to participate in the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the Nanchang Headquarters prepared to close down due to the lack of military needs. However, the political part was related to the aftermath of the bandit areas and the revitalization of the ten provinces. At that time, it was impossible to abandon the project halfway. Therefore, it was postponed until January this year before it was stopped. According to official news, the Nanchang Headquarters will be abolished at the end of the month. The staff members will, except for most of them who will follow the staff to Sichuan, some will return to the Third Department of the Military Affairs Committee, and another part will be transferred to the Jiangxi Provincial Pacification Headquarters to work. The rest will be given a month's salary and dismissed. The task of completing the uncompleted bandit suppression and aftermath will be assigned to the various pacification headquarters. At the time of the closing of the Nanchang Headquarters, a brief overview of military and political affairs is given to provide a retrospect.</p>
<p>In 1933 and 1934, Chairman Chiang was completely in Jiangxi, except for a trip to Fujian. He frequently traveled to Fuzhou, Nancheng, and Mount Lu. In terms of military affairs, in addition to quelling the rebellion in Fujian and the Shi Sun rebellion, continuing to complete the joint suppression by the three provinces, and directing the bandit suppression operations in Sichuan, more than 40 counties were recovered in Jiangxi, and more than 30 counties were recovered in Fujian. At their peak, the Zhu Mao Peng Lin Fang (Zhimin) Xiao (Ke) Luo (Binghui) factions had no less than 100,000 guns and 300,000 men. Only 30,000 to 40,000 guns entered Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou. In terms of political affairs, in addition to completely reforming the bandit areas, for the ten provinces, in terms of civil administration, the Baojia system was vigorously implemented, household registration was checked, compulsory labor was universally compiled, and conscription was implemented. In terms of construction, a general mobilization was carried out to build roads to facilitate transportation, and forests were planted to prevent floods and droughts. Finance was uniformly collected and disbursed, and education vigorously implemented education that combined production, upbringing, and hygiene. The judiciary cleared accumulated cases and did its best to provide convenience to the people. In addition, the provincial government worked together, the county government expanded its organization, and administrative commissioners were added to change to a three-level political system. The ten provinces were strictly ordered to complete the four major political tasks of checking household registration, clearing land and repairing dams, building roads, compiling Baojia, and completing self-defense during the training period in 1935, which were major reforms in our country's politics.

<h3 id="e69">New Tenth Division <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Recovers Eastern Fujian Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Captures Many Bandits</p>
<p>Remnants Flee Towards Shouning</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Xiao Gan, commander of the newly compiled Tenth Division stationed in eastern Fujian, recently took a ship from Fuding to Xiapu to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits. The boiler exploded en route, and Xiao drowned. Xiao's coffin has been transported to Fuzhou from Sandu on the 25th. Many staff members of the Security Department went to Taijiang Wharf to greet it. The provincial government sent a military band to send it to Xilin Temple outside the West Gate. On the 26th, the coffin was re-changed and encoffined, and a meeting will be held at a later date to mourn him. The provincial government has appointed Secretary-General Gao Dengting and Security Department Chief of Staff She Nianci as funeral committee members and requested central government condolences.</p>
<p>After Xiao's death, Shi Honglie, deputy commander of the Eighty-seventh Division, was appointed as the acting commander of the New Tenth Division. His troops still follow the original bandit suppression plan, dividing the entire division into twenty-three detachments, which were dispatched from the Shekou Saiqi line in Fu'an County to carry out a major sweep of the bandit areas. In the past three days, they have fought fiercely with various bandits and captured many of them. According to a telegram report from the division to the province yesterday, a total of more than 100 long and short guns, more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 10 loads of propaganda materials, more than 20 loads of grain guns and machines, several loads of ammunition raw materials and steel, dozens of loads of ploughing fodder, hundreds of counterfeit coins, and a pile of banners and seals were seized. More than 30 fake government offices, fake team headquarters, military hospitals, and cooperative agencies were destroyed, and more than 100 hostages were rescued. More than 200 wounded and sick bandits were captured. The so-called strongest bandit area in eastern Fujian, with a width of more than 200 li and more than 100 large and small villages, was completely recovered. The remaining bandits fled towards Shouning. The names of the people in the bandit group were learned from the seized documents, such as Feng Pintai, the fake commander of the Fujian-East Independent Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army; Ye Qi, the fake political commissar; Hu Shiru, the fake commander of the First Regiment; Commissar Cai; You Shou, the commander of the Second Regiment; Zhu Desheng, the commissar; Wei Geng, the commander of the Third Regiment; Yang Yingshan, the commissar; Wu Debiao, the commander of the Fourth Regiment; and Huang Lishu, the commissar. The names of the commanders and political commissars of the two independent regiments are unknown. In addition, each of the seven counties of Ningde, Fu'an, Shouning, Fuding, Xiapu, Luoyuan, and Lianjiang has a fake government, each with an independent battalion, with hundreds of people in each battalion and dozens of guns. Each district has a guerrilla team, with a total of 76 teams, with dozens of people and a dozen guns in each team. The fake independent division has a total of four regiments, each with four companies and another special company. The fake division has a total of more than 700 bandits and soldiers, more than 500 rifles, two heavy machine guns, one mortar, one hundred light automatic guns, more than 20 hand-held submachine guns, 140 Mauser pistols (that is, box guns) (7 or 8 Mauser pistols in each of the seven squads of the special team), 40 pistols, an average of 40 rounds of ammunition per gun, and one hand grenade per two people. According to the records in the bandit documents, these guns and ammunition were all purchased from Gutian, Changle, and Putian. Even more strangely, the bandit records show that 6,000 rounds of ammunition were received from Fu'an County. The authorities have now ordered reconnaissance and strict prevention, and are implementing river blockades in each county. The method is to set up card checkpoints in Ningde, Fu'an, Fuding, Xiapu, and Shouning to stop ships. Each county will set up a ship inspection station and, together with the garrison troops in each area, conduct strict inspections and issue inspection certificates, filling in the starting point. If the ship exceeds the starting point, it should be subject to the same inspection again, in order to be thorough and avoid theft. This matter is hosted by the county magistrates. Recently, it has been decided to issue good citizen certificates, self-renewal certificates, and residence permits to distinguish between good and bad, and to facilitate the progress of rural clearing matters. The county governments have fully prepared for this. To enrich the countryside and prosper the locality, people living outside and refugees in various townships will be ordered to return to their hometowns. Those who fail to do so within the deadline will have their property confiscated as appropriate, and implementation measures are being drafted. (January 26)</p>

<p>Inspection Schedule for the Yellow River</p>
<p>Guthrie and Purdy to Depart as Scheduled</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: League of Nations water conservancy experts Nie Yufu and Guthrie, among others, traveled by car from Bian on the 23rd, along the south bank of the Yellow River, to the Pinghan Railway Bridge. After crossing the river, they inspected the sections on the north bank of the Yellow River near Wuzhi and the mouth of the Qin River, observing the water conditions and river defenses. They returned to Bian at 8 PM on the 24th. It is now reported that expert Guthrie and Economic Commission advisor Purdy are planning to depart from Bian on the 26th, traveling along the Yellow River in Henan province to inspect the sections within Hebei and Shandong provinces.

After inspecting the north bank, they will proceed south along the river bank and are expected to arrive in Jinan around the 28th or 29th of this month. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission previously telegraphed the Hebei and Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureaus to inquire about local conditions along the route and whether there would be any difficulties in crossing the river. They have now received replies from both sides, stating that the local areas are relatively peaceful and that there are no difficulties in crossing the river. Shandong has also dispatched cars and troops to meet them at the border between Shandong and Hebei, with Song, a technician from the Shandong Construction Bureau, and Zhang Lianjia, the director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, also going to welcome them.

These recruits will be trained and then appointed. The qualifications for the team members recommended by the counties are as follows: 1. Must be graduates of senior elementary school or complete elementary school; 2. Must be between 18 and 40 years old; 3. Must be physically healthy and free from bad habits; 4. Must be of a docile nature, able to endure hardship, and suitable for rural fieldwork.

In addition, they should pay attention to the following matters: 1. Changes in the river's course; 2. The condition of engineering projects; 3. The extent of damage to embankments and dams; 4. Rat burrows, infiltration points, and gullies; 5. The types, quantities, and locations of materials stored along the river; 6. Assisting in emergency rescue in various provinces; 7. Assisting in protecting power lines, highways, forests, buildings, and other objects in the flooded areas; 8. Cracking down on acts that damage embankments and other actions that hinder river defenses. It is also reported that after the team members are selected from various locations, they are scheduled to be concentrated at the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission in Kaifeng before March 1st to be inspected and begin training.

<h3 id="e72">Japan's Oil Problem (Tokyo Correspondence) <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Lack of Resources Makes Self-Sufficiency Difficult</p>
<p>As Japanese capitalism develops upward, exports actively increase. For example, the export of cotton cloth has exceeded that of the United Kingdom by more than 500 million square yards in the past year. Japan is both extensively developing new markets and expanding considerably in the old markets of the United Kingdom. Consequently, industrial production capacity has suddenly expanded, and Japan has become a newly emerging capitalist country. However, relying solely on peaceful economic development faces many obstacles, so military force must be used as a backing, and military preparations must be vigorously expanded.</p>
<p>However, in military expansion, in addition to coal and iron needing to be self-sufficient, liquid fuel, i.e., petroleum, is even more important. The amount of petroleum produced domestically in Japan, even including Hokkaido, Taiwan, and the oil mines leased from the Soviet Union in the northern part of Sakhalin Island, is decreasing year by year. In 1929, the petroleum produced in the above areas still accounted for 14.2% of Japan's total consumption, but by 1933, it had dropped to 7.8%. The statistics for last year have not yet been confirmed, but based on the general situation, it is indeed decreasing further. Therefore, can the army, navy, and the private industrial sector not regard this as a major problem at a time when a large amount of petroleum is needed?</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, Japan made its greatest effort to negotiate with the authorities of the Dutch East Indies in an attempt to obtain oil exploitation rights there to supplement the domestic production shortfall. However, the negotiations were unsuccessful because the Anglo-Dutch petroleum company was unwilling to easily relinquish its rights, and the Netherlands was also very cautious and unwilling to allow foreign capital to enter and exit casually. Currently, the only relatively promising area is the oil field on Sakhalin Island. However, due to the cold climate in this area, there are various inconveniences in exploitation, and transportation in winter is especially difficult. Active development is very troublesome. Furthermore, the Soviet Union is using its national controlled economic power to engage in oil mine development. Although the deposits in the Soviet mine areas are much more abundant than those in the areas leased by Japan, they can never be transferred. Therefore, Japan's ideas about the oil mines there are still not fully assured.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Soviet Union has recently expanded its Second Five-Year Plan, the BAM Railway, which will be completed in two or three years. The terminal of this railway is Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, across from Sakhalin Island. It already has the convenience of transportation. In peacetime, Japan's "North Sakhalin Oil Company" is definitely not a match for Soviet operations. Moreover, under the red legal regulations, Japan's private industry must be subject to restrictions on labor treatment and capital utilization. It is naturally more difficult to compete with red oil development. If military action occurs, it will feel even less secure. Japan's efforts to develop petroleum are primarily aimed at military use, especially wartime use, so it is particularly worried.</p>
<p>According to the current international situation, an accident is unlikely to occur immediately between Japan and the Soviet Union, but a future conflict is probably unavoidable. Then it will probably be very difficult for Japan to cross the Sea of Okhotsk and control the oil mines on Sakhalin Island. The past event of the Siberian Intervention in 1919 shows that Japan once occupied Sakhalin Island with military force. In the end, it was still unable to control it. When Russia was exhausted, it was still like this. Now that it has the power to defend itself, it is probably even more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan has no choice but to make every effort to prepare alternative fuels, such as charcoal, alcohol, and the distillation of oil shale. After a long period of research, an oil shale plant was established in Fushun. However, this type of manufacturing has relatively high production costs, and the quantity produced is not very large. It is very uneconomical at present. It is reported that Japanese petroleum companies have recently been importing crude oil produced in the United States and Anglo-Dutch countries for self-refining. This method is very economical in peacetime. However, in wartime, both the United States and the United Kingdom, especially the crude oil from California, which has the largest import volume, will inevitably be cut off, and fuel will still be a major problem. Therefore, the Petroleum Industry Law promulgated in July 1934 requires that companies in the industry maintain an oil reserve of more than six months. This raises issues with the capital and equipment of the companies. Even if they can store the required amount, the need increases year by year, which is also a long-term troublesome matter.

<h3 id="e73">Gansu Province <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing Appropriations and Exorbitant Taxes</p>
<p>Annual Revenue Reduced by Approximately 380,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Finance Director Zhu Jingzhou Sends Personnel to Investigate Again</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Gansu, located in a remote border area, has always been known for its poverty and was a province that received subsidies during the late Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the subsidies were cut off, and for military and administrative expenses, appropriations became the only way to cope. Regardless of whether the counties had funds, they were assessed each month and appropriated accordingly. Once an assessment was made, it was apportioned to the people, which burdened officials and distressed the people. Since Zhu Jingzhou took charge of finance, he had long planned to eliminate this practice, but the Ningxia war prevented him from realizing it. Until recently, with military and administrative expenses slightly reduced compared to before, he presented a request to the provincial government last year to abolish all appropriations in the counties of Longdong, Longnan, and the former Lan Mountain Circuit, starting from January of the 24th year of the Republic, to alleviate the people's hardship. It is said that the counties in Hexi are still under overall planning. Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are even worse policies. Therefore, Zhu eliminated 57 types that were excessively disruptive and detrimental to the livelihood of ordinary people, which collected approximately 380,000 yuan annually, and those listed in the first phase were also determined to be abolished starting from January 1, 24th year of the Republic. Although the public sector may suffer a slight loss, the people of the entire province will greatly benefit. It is now reported that Zhu has sent personnel to investigate by region, and if there are any similar exorbitant taxes or miscellaneous levies that are inconvenient to the people's livelihood after a detailed report, they will all be eliminated in order. The following is a list of the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies that Gansu Province has implemented to abolish starting from the 24th year of the Republic.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Henan Finance Department Formulates <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Financial Consolidation Measures</p>
<p>Estimated Deficit of Approximately One Million Yuan This Year</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Finance Director Yin Renxian, in order to consolidate the province's finances, has formulated consolidation measures, which have been submitted to the provincial government and notified to various agencies. The original report stated that according to the budget, the province's finances could be offset, but in recent years, although politics has become stable, finances have not yet been brought into line, and the budget has lost its effectiveness. For example, the contingency fund was originally set at over 330,000 yuan, intended to meet urgent needs within a year. However, within four months of the start of the year, it has been completely exhausted, and temporary funds continue to come in endlessly. Therefore, since Renxian took office, only two months ago, temporary expenditures of approximately 300,000 yuan, which were not included in the budget, have been approved. Together with the road construction costs in southern Henan, an additional 1,360,000 yuan needs to be raised, totaling approximately 1,663,000 yuan in expenditures approved outside the budget. Among them, 884,000 yuan have been made up through various savings by Renxian, but the remaining 777,800 yuan are still outstanding and have no source. Furthermore, revenue is expected to decrease by approximately 210,000 yuan, while expenditures have increased by 770,000 yuan, resulting in an estimated deficit of approximately one million yuan. Therefore, the following four measures are proposed: 1. Maintain the budget. The budget is the standard for administrative facilities and must be maintained jointly to be effective. In the future, any funds not included in the budget will not be paid; 2. If there are urgent and unavoidable projects, they cannot be stopped due to lack of funds. However, the department must first raise the funds and approve them after the funds are secured; 3. Savings from various agencies are mostly used for self-funded expenses and are not willing to be deposited. In the future, any requests for expenses from savings will not be approved, and they will be required to deposit the full amount to meet urgent needs; 4. The revenue and expenditure of various public institutions will also be required to be deposited, and the necessary expenses will be re-issued by the provincial treasury. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Yuehan Railway Zhushao Section <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Two Sections of Construction Completed</p>
<p>A Small Section of Luojiadu to be Completed by the End of March</p>
<p>Yuehan Railway Can Be Reached in Three Days After Opening to Jinjiling</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the completion and opening of the Shaole section of the Yuehan Railway Zhushao section, construction north of Lechang is also proceeding actively. The section from Lechang to Chumen, with a length of 23 kilometers, has been completed and began selling tickets on the 18th of this month. Passengers and goods are temporarily transported by engineering vehicles. The Luojiadu section is scheduled to open to traffic on February 15th, and the Jinjiling section is expected to open to traffic in April. According to the engineering report of the Zhushao Engineering Bureau, the second section and the third section were connected, and construction began in April of the 23rd year of the Republic. Among them, a small section from Luojiadu to Jinjiling, with a length of about 60 kilometers, is expected to be completed by the end of March of the 24th year of the Republic. Starting from April of the 24th year of the Republic, it can be connected to the second section for traffic. Currently, the Hunan Provincial Highway has been opened from Changsha to Hengzhou, and from Hengzhou to Pingshi in Guangdong Province. The Guangdong Provincial Construction Department is accelerating the expansion, striving to connect with the Jinjiling Railway in April of this year. At that time, those traveling from Guangdong to Hankou can take the Yuehan Railway train from Guangzhou to Jinjiling, transfer to a public bus to Changsha in Hunan, and then transfer to the Xiang-E section of the Yuehan Railway to reach Hankou directly, which will only take three days. At the same time, the joint operation of the Zhushao Railway and the Hunan Provincial Highway will make freight and travel more convenient. As for the tunnel construction on the section from Lechang to Luojiadu, there are as many as 34 tunnels, with a total length of more than 7,000 feet. After sending a team to re-measure, avoiding the difficult, the route runs along the east bank of the Wu River to avoid the complicated tunnel construction, focusing on the construction of retaining walls. The original survey location was deeper, transportation was inconvenient, excavation was difficult, and the supply of materials was particularly difficult. The re-surveyed line only requires eight tunnels, and after construction began, after observing the local conditions, three more tunnels were removed, so the final decision is to have only five tunnels, namely Dazi Water Tunnel, Qimen Tunnel, Meimen Tunnel, Xinqin Tunnel, and Yuanluojiao Tunnel.</p>

<p>Sending Personnel to Anhui to Distribute Relief</p>
<p>Initial Allocation of 150,000 Yuan for Relief Funds</p>
<p>A Total of Twenty Heavily Affected Counties</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province has suffered severely from drought and banditry, and the disaster victims are displaced on the roads. In this cold winter, the sound of hunger and cold can be heard everywhere. The Anhui Disaster Relief Association, due to the provincial government's lack of funds, is heartbroken by what they see. The relief grain that was previously relied upon for urgent relief has now been ordered to be suspended. In addition to using the 100,000 dan that has been collected and stored to urgently relieve the most severely affected counties, it was agreed with the Shanghai Relief Association for the Relief of Drought Disasters in Various Provinces to send investigator, Chief Master Hong San, etc., to urgently distribute the relief funds in advance. The dispatched investigators are departing for the northern and southern counties of Anhui. The first batch of 13 counties in southern Anhui includes Shen Nianci, the head of the investigation team from Dongliu to Zhide, Peng Guangguang from Shitai to Qingyang, Fang Weilan from Shexian to Xiuning, Zhang Zigan from Huo County, Qimen is undecided, Chen Moyan from Jixi, Xu Yuntao from Ningguo, and Jingde, Jixi, and Taiping, because they have suffered the most from bandit disasters, are designated as special zones, with Zhu Jiatian as the chief executive and the executive director of Jingde, Xie Ji'an as the executive director of Jing County, and Jiang Xuwu as the executive director of Taiping. The seven counties in northern Anhui include Wang Choutian from Qianshan, Zhang Qiaofu from Taihu, Zhang Ziyang from Lihuang and Huoqiu, Heng Yongquan from Huoshan, and Huaining (i.e., Anqing). Tongcheng are currently undecided. Zhu Jiatian and Xie Ji'an, etc., have departed today to go to Wuhu, visiting people from the three counties of Jing, Jingde, and Tai who are residing in Wuhu, inquiring about the disaster situation in those counties. The total amount of relief funds allocated to Anhui by the relief association is 150,000 yuan. Even if there is an increase in the future, it will be difficult to reach 300,000 yuan. With such a wide disaster area and such a severe disaster situation, it is feared that it will be a drop in the bucket and will not help. An appeal has been made to fellow villagers living abroad to donate more, so that disaster victims who are about to die can survive. In a subsequent conversation with reporters, it was stated that the standard for this relief distribution is to prioritize those who have suffered the most from both banditry and drought. After careful review, the first batch is 20 counties, including Jing and Tai, and the rest will be distributed in order. The disaster victims who receive relief should be over 50 years old, under 15 years old, or disabled, or those who cannot survive without relief. The principle of saving the dying but not the poor will be strictly enforced. After the investigators arrive in the disaster-stricken counties, they will go to the disaster area to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure speed. Each adult will receive one yuan, and each child will receive five jiao. Relief tickets will be issued directly to the disaster victims without the intervention of any organizations to avoid malpractice. Another review will be conducted, and then the investigator will jointly determine the location with the county government, distribute them by region, and issue them by name to avoid crowding. However, it is now the coldest period, and the beginning of spring is coming soon. The disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief, so there can be no delay in Wuhu, and it has been decided to set off tomorrow morning. It is also reported that Jing County's fellow villagers in Wuhu have raised more than 10,000 yuan in relief funds, Jingde's fellow villagers have raised 6,000 yuan in relief funds, and Taiping's fellow villagers have raised 5,000 yuan in relief funds, all of which have been handed over to Zhu and others for distribution. Chief Master Hong San, the resident investigator in Anhui, seeing the vast disaster situation in southern Anhui, will come to Wuhu in the next few days to inspect various counties and supervise the distribution of relief by the investigators.

<p>County Government Thoroughly Investigating Bottled Seasoning Powder</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce recently reported to the Dried Goods and Tea Food Industry Association, stating that according to reports from association members such as Juchangsheng, a seasoning powder with red or yellow halls has been found on the market recently, which does not indicate the manufacturer's name or the manager's brand name. It is inevitable that it is a substandard product mixed with harmful substances that endanger the people. They have requested an investigation. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the matter concerns public health and is of great importance, so it has reported the situation to the county government and ordered a crackdown. It is now known that the county government has instructed the Public Security Bureau to conduct strict inspections and arrests.</p>

<p>The family of the late resident Xi Jinlan in Yangjiawan, District 3 of this county, was previously robbed of property by bandits, and his son Xi Xuechun was kidnapped. Gu A'nan, the main criminal in the case, was arrested by the Lujiaweizhen Chamber of Commerce and the merchant corps, along with Wang Xiangsheng, who was hiding the kidnapped victim in Zhuanqiao, Fengxian County, about four li south of the town. The kidnapped victim was rescued, and suspects Cai Shunqian, Yang Heshang, Chen Qinshi, Sun Genxiang, and Chen Jinlin were arrested at the same time and sent to the county for interrogation. After repeated and clear investigations by the county government, the date for sentencing was yesterday. Wu, the presiding judge, presented Gu A'nan and others and sentenced Gu A'nan in court to death for directly and importantly assisting in kidnapping and extortion, with permanent deprivation of public rights. Wang Xiangsheng was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for directly and importantly assisting in kidnapping and extortion, with deprivation of personal rights for twelve years.

<p>Yang Xiangqi, the leader of the Daqiangmen branch of the 13th branch of the County Chamber of Commerce merchant corps, heard a very urgent gong sound south of Daqiangmen Town when he went out on patrol at midnight on the 24th of this month. He immediately led more than a dozen members of the corps to patrol and learned that the home of Zhou Genbao in Tangjiaqiao, about three li from the town, had been broken into and robbed by six or seven thieves. They searched with live ammunition and arrested Jiang Tianbao and Sun Lin on the spot, while the others escaped. After bringing them back to the corps, they were strictly interrogated, and the thieves confessed that they had been arrested for robbery. They were presented to the county government yesterday, and staff member Yu opened a court hearing and ordered them to be detained pending transfer to the local branch court for investigation. The home of Hu Dalaoguan, a resident of Si Tou Village near Donghutang in District 6, was also robbed of twelve dan of white rice by masked bandits.</p>

<p>This county has always been known as a region with developed industry and commerce, and there are numerous silk and yarn mills throughout the county. In recent years, silk mills have been unable to maintain production due to low silk prices and a sharp decline in foreign silk sales. Currently, only fifteen silk mills, such as Yongtai, are勉强 maintained, which is less than 40% compared to the peak period. As the end of the lunar year approaches, all the silk mills that are still operating are closing down one after another because the final closing period is approaching. Four mills, including Longchang, closed down yesterday, and the rest must close down by the end of this month at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Businesses of All Sizes Closing Down One After Another <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, due to frequent natural disasters, the rural economy has collapsed, and urban commerce has also plummeted. Bankruptcies are caused by tight financial turnover. As the end of the lunar year approaches, the final settlement period is approaching, and stores with high debts are unable to maintain themselves. For example, Sanmao Dried Goods Store outside the South Gate, Sun Chunyang Tea Food Store at the North Suspension Bridge, Hangzhou Hengfeng Silk Factory on Tongyun Road, and Yongmao Clothing Store, Shunxing Noodle Restaurant, etc., have all closed down one after another in the past few days. Xinmeihua Shoe and Hat Foreign Goods Store, which was opened by Shen Yuting and his son, has been in business for more than ten years. Recently, due to slow business, it has been unable to maintain itself, so it stopped operating yesterday and hired lawyer Sun Xiangcheng as a representative to announce the liquidation and solicit bids. The sluggish state of society has reached its peak.</p>

<p>Xing Heshang, a man from Bao'ying, 30 years old, came to Wuxi with his wife Xu a few years ago to make a living and moved to Changan Bridge in this county, where he opened Zhang Hengsheng Noodle Shop. The business was still good, so life was quite comfortable. However, at about 3 PM yesterday, Xing went to Baimuqiao and returned to the city. While passing by the bend near the Railway Hotel, a Xicheng long-distance bus sped towards him. The monk could not avoid it in time and was knocked down by the bus. The front wheel ran over Xing's left calf, causing the skin to break and the bones to shatter. His leg was crushed off, and blood flowed all over the ground, a terrible sight. The Xicheng Company knew that an accident had occurred and immediately sent Xing's child to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Zhu, the injury was very serious, and even if he survived, he would become disabled.</p>

<p>Jingbo, the abbot of Qingliang Temple outside the South Gate of Wuyi, had transferred over 60,000 yuan in savings accumulated over the years from Shanghai to build the Sutra Repository. Recently, it was completely completed. The total construction costs required more than 100,000 yuan, still leaving a considerable deficit. Abbot Jingbo went to Shanghai again to find ways to raise funds, bringing back more than 3,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, with over 1,200 yuan remaining, which was placed in a drawer in the bedroom and locked at all times. Jingbo then went to Shanghai to raise funds and made a long-distance call to the temple, instructing the assistant abbot to send the savings passbook to Shanghai by express mail. Unexpectedly, when the assistant abbot went to the room to retrieve the item, both the door lock and the desk lock had been destroyed. He immediately telegraphed Abbot Jingbo. Jingbo returned upon hearing the alarm. Upon checking, the foreign currency stored in the drawer had vanished. After questioning the caretaker thoroughly, he was considered highly suspicious and was planned to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation in the coming days.</p>

Jia immediately bribed Zhou Fuchen, the younger brother of the county magistrate, with 3,000 yuan, obtaining a lenient sentence of a fine and release. Subsequently, someone reported the matter to the Nanchang Headquarters, and after investigation by officials sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was confirmed. Consequently, County Magistrate Zhou Heng was dismissed from his post. Zhou Xieyun, Fang Jimin, and Zhang Younan, the director of the western granary responsible for grain collection, who handled the bribe, were all sent to the Zhenjiang Court for interrogation. After several court hearings, Zhou and Fang were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Zhang Younan alone was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, fined 500 yuan, and jailed, which he deeply resented. He immediately appealed to the High Court, which remanded the case to the Zhenjiang Court for retrial. According to news from Zhenjiang, Zhang was granted bail and temporarily released after the interrogation on the 24th and is expected to return to Changshu in the coming days.</p>

<p>Opium smuggling still persists. At about 4 PM on the 25th, the Datong Company's Hongda steamer arrived upstream. Passengers disembarked one after another. Li Fengyun, a patrolman from the First Branch of the port, found Zhang Jinlin in possession of a paper package and discovered 80 taels of opium, which he confiscated and transferred to the branch bureau and then to the general bureau. According to Zhang's statement, the opium was entrusted to him by Li Heshang, a tea server at Jiang Juxing Inn. The person has already fled. Currently, the sources of opium at the port are all soil dealers such as Cheng Tiansheng, Zhang Zongsi, and Jiang Achun, who purchase it from Hankou and entrust it to Jiang steamers for smuggling, making it difficult to eradicate. He will be handed over to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>Huang Youmei, a policeman from the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Sanyang Town, Fourth District, came to the county the day before yesterday (the 23rd) and stayed at the Xinsheng Inn on Fuxi Street. At about 9 PM that evening, Wang Xiong, an inspector, and Liu Yuting, an adjutant, from the county Public Security Bureau, inspected the hotel's guests. Seeing that Huang was wearing a police uniform but did not have an外出證, they subjected him to inspection and found a packet of heroin in his pocket. They immediately took both the person and the evidence to the bureau. Yesterday afternoon (the 24th), he was transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of rickshaw pullers in Zhenjiang who own their vehicles petitioning for business licenses, after an investigation by officials sent by the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, the county government feared that the method of purchasing privately-owned vehicles was not sound. Therefore, the committee stipulated two measures and telegraphed them to the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government for joint review and implementation. The measures are as follows: 1. Rickshaw pullers owning vehicles should purchase private vehicle licenses. Illegal business operations should be banned, and they should be instructed to obtain business vehicle licenses instead. 2. The government should consider the actual needs when issuing business licenses for privately-owned vehicles. The number of licenses should be jointly determined by the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government but should not be less than the number of people applying for business vehicle licenses this time.</p>

<p>Li Dehai Oil Mill in Wangjia Alley, about two miles from Shiqiao, Jiangdu, was attacked by a large group of bandits armed with guns at about 7 PM on the 24th. They forbade any outcry and ordered the mill owner, Li Fuyi, to hand over silver and cash. When Li hesitated in his response, they shot him in the head, piercing one eye, killing him instantly. They also shot and wounded Yan Shu, a mill worker. Simultaneously, the bandits divided into groups and went to Li's residence (diagonally opposite the oil mill), arbitrarily looting and stealing loot before fleeing with shouts. After inspecting the losses, it was found that 98 silver dollars, four jiao in small coins, 12,300 copper coins, and four pieces of men's and women's leather and cotton clothing were stolen from the oil mill. From the house, 130 silver dollars, 6,000 copper coins, a gold hairpin, a gold ear pick, a gold ring, and many pieces of men's and women's clothing were stolen. At the time, the local police station, citing insufficient police force, rushed to report to the Second Branch in Zhouzhou. While passing through Xinqiao Town, they encountered Director Tang Chuliang and Adjutant Zhao on patrol, who immediately led the police to rush to the scene. The bandits had already fled.</p>

<p>More than a thousand members of the Small Sword Society in the Second District of Huaiyin have been suppressed by the two regiments of the Provincial Security Brigade and the security teams of the Huai and Si counties since the 20th of this month, and their momentum has been somewhat diminished. According to the county magistrate of Huaiyin, who returned to the city on the 22nd, after the Small Sword Society bandits were suppressed in Huai, a part of them fled to Siyang. On the morning of the 21st, the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Brigade received a notice from the First Regiment and entered Huangxu, Siyang, to assist in the suppression. They engaged in battle in the area of the Twelfth Bao and Nanxinji in Siyang. Both sides exchanged heavy gunfire, killing more than 200 bandits. The First Regiment of the Provincial Security Brigade also engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in Tianxu, Siyang, killing more than 100 bandits. The bandit side suffered heavy losses. Currently, all units are still in pursuit. However, the provincial government has telegraphed again, ordering the dispatch of more troops to suppress them in order to eliminate the bandit scourge permanently and ensure local peace.</p>

<p>In Pingtiaozhuang, Jianshui Township, Eighth District, west of the lake in this county, seven or eight bandits suddenly arrived at about 1 AM last night. Each carried pistols and rifles. They first went to the home of farmer Yang Zhensan and broke in. The family members were awakened from their sleep. The bandits dragged Yang's wife from the bed, tied her with ropes, and poured kerosene on her, forcing her to reveal where the silver was hidden. After being doused, Yang's wife was on the verge of death. Helpless, the bandits searched everywhere, losing over a thousand yuan worth of silver dollars and valuables. The bandits were still not satisfied and went to the home of their neighbor, Yang Bolin. Yang had already woken up upon hearing the alarm, and he and his wife used their bodies to block the door. Unable to enter, the bandits fired two shots, both hitting Bolin's waist. He fell to the ground instantly, severely injured, and his life may be in danger.</p>

At about 11 PM last night, more than ten bandits, similar to salt smugglers, armed with sharp weapons, arrived at the home of farmer Wei Guihe in Xujiayanqiao, east of Zhanghui Town. Taking advantage of a gap, they escaped to the roof, where the bandits spotted them. They fired shots to threaten them. Startled, they fell from the roof. His wife, Shen, rushed out of the door, crying for help, and was shot by the bandits. As a result, she was shot three times, fell to the ground, and died. The loss was several thousand yuan. As the bandits were about to leave, they dropped a hat and several rifle bullets. Fei Gongxia, the director of the Fengjing Beizhen Public Security Bureau, together with the water patrol captain, went to the countryside to investigate and arrest the bandits. 2. In Fengjiadou, Tianren Village, more than ten robbers arrived at Shen Erguan's house the day before yesterday while they were husking rice. They shouted and wielded sharp weapons, broke down the door, and tied Erguan and his family members with hemp ropes. They looted and stole eight shi of white rice, clothes, and other items worth about 200 yuan. They spent an hour looting before leaving by boat.</p>

<p>At the end of the year in Xiaoshan, due to rural bankruptcy, business in various industries is exceptionally sluggish. Even the loans made to the countryside have not been collected at all. For example, grocery stores rely entirely on receivables to repay other debts. Having encountered such a lean year, the receivables have been severely impacted, and many cannot even sustain themselves. Furthermore, the money shops, which were originally scheduled to close and cease payments on the 20th of the lunar calendar, have had to delay the settlement date due to uncollected receivables from various industries. It is estimated that the accounts can only be settled on the day before New Year's Eve. Moreover, there are more than twenty merchants who have closed down in both urban and rural areas, which shows the decline of commerce in Xiaoshan.</p>

<p>4.  Errors in the Recognition of Contemporary Chinese Figures. The Japanese pride themselves on their ability to keenly observe and analyze figures, a skill in which they claim to surpass Westerners. However, when it comes to key Chinese figures, I have yet to see the Japanese make accurate assessments. Take, for example, the frequent commentaries on Mr. Chiang in publications like the Japan Diplomatic Times. In the Japanese commentary, Mr. Chiang is often compared with past Chinese figures such as Yuan Shikai and Li Hongzhang, which is truly an inappropriate analogy. Yuan Shikai and Li Hongzhang each have their place in Chinese history, and it is not necessary to discuss them here. However, Mr. Chiang and Yuan and Li lived in eras separated by at least a generation (in China, 30 years is considered a generation). Regardless of their different backgrounds, educations, or environments, the times in which they lived are absolutely different. Yuan and Li rose from the imperial era or the imperial examination era. Mr. Chiang, since his youth, had already participated in revolutionary organizations. For more than thirty years afterward, during the period of greatest malleability in life, he never left the revolutionary cause. His education and thought can be said to have been molded entirely by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. His life has never escaped the revolutionary environment. I do not believe that there are so-called supermen in the world. Everyone is influenced by the times and the environment. Mr. Chiang is who he is entirely because he grew up in a revolutionary environment. It can be said that there is not a single trace of the consciousness or habits of the pre-imperial era in his blood or mind. The distance between Mr. Chiang and Yuan and Li can be said to be like the distance between a modern Republic of China and a despotic state hundreds of years ago. They belong to two completely different eras and two completely different types. Comparing Mr. Chiang with Yuan and Li and using the habits and understanding of Yuan and Li to judge Mr. Chiang is truly as ridiculous as the Chinese saying, "Laozi and Han Fei are transmitted together." I assert that the Japanese have not really understood Mr. Chiang because they have not recognized the era and the figure. Therefore, they want to apply the methods previously used on the remnant figures of the imperial era to the present, hoping to achieve the same effect, which is obviously impossible. Let me give an example here. I am not a member of the Chinese Kuomintang, so of course I do not know the content and details of the Kuomintang's foreign policy. However, I know that the Kuomintang's so-called revolutionary foreign policy has its own unique and consistent strategy. After the Jinan Incident, I heard that Tan Yankai, the chairman of the National Government, questioned Chiang Kai-shek, the military commander at the time, "If you want to defend Jinan to the death, how can you withdraw the main force of the Northern Expedition? If you want to abandon Jinan, why leave a regiment of troops to defend Jinan to the death, and finally order them to withdraw?" Mr. Chiang replied, "This is the strategy of our revolutionary army. First, of course, we must show the revolutionary spirit of not yielding, and show that Jinan was forcibly occupied by Japanese troops, not abandoned by China itself. Second, we must consider the overall situation of the revolution and not hinder the progress of the Northern Expedition. Third, we must preserve the Chinese army and not make meaningless sacrifices. As long as Jinan resists for three days, the Japanese act of forceful occupation will be exposed to the world, then the purpose will have been achieved. Therefore, in the end, I ordered the regiment that was defending to the death to risk withdrawing, and let the outside world know that we wanted to use the strength of a regiment of men to confront the entire division of Fukuda." I observed Mr. Chiang's use of troops against Japan, from Shanghai, the Battle of the Great Wall, to the final withdrawal from the Battle of Miyun. It can be said that it is all a consistent spirit since the Jinan Incident. At least it can show that the revolutionary army cannot abandon any place where its strength lies without paying a price. Japan wanted to apply the precedent of easily obtaining Shenyang to all of China, but it is ultimately impossible. We have repeatedly studied Mr. Chiang's diplomatic policy toward Japan and recalled the opinion letter he issued in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China. We can see that his position on Japanese diplomacy is "no severance of relations, no declaration of war, no peace talks, no treaty." This diplomatic policy of his is completely consistent with his so-called defensive tactics of gradual resistance and the revolutionary strategy of being strong, unyielding, and adaptable, and it has never changed. However, this policy is not thorough, and some people in the country at the time strongly opposed it. But looking back now, one cannot help but say that this policy is relatively the only way out, because countries with unequal national and military strength can only use this policy and strategy to deal with each other. If Japan understands this principle, it should know that if Japan wants to threaten China again with force and obtain a result of submission, it can be said that it will not achieve its purpose. This is not because the revolutionary authorities have any ability that surpasses their predecessors, but simply because the times are different. In the past, in the imperial era or the warlord era, when encountering dangerous times, the authorities were afraid and submitted because of the concept of preserving their own interests and positions. Now, in the revolutionary period in China, the high degree of national consciousness no longer allows the authorities to have a single bit of selfishness. Since they have embraced the idea of "dying for the country" and "laying down their lives," what is there to fear or worry about? In the end, China's adoption of this revolutionary strategy and policy of "always ready to die, seeking survival at every step" will also lead Japan to the same fate.</p>
<p>5.  Ignoring the Errors of Chinese National Mentality. Judging from the various steps Japan has taken towards China recently, one cannot help but say that "they are too eager to harm each other but too ignorant of each other." Japan, on the one hand, creates the false premise that the Chinese people can never compromise with Japan, and therefore believes that only by destroying the Chinese nation can Japan rest easy. Moreover, it believes that to destroy China, it must use extremely vicious means to prevent it from ever recovering. Regarding the first point, I dare to assert that there is no absolutely irreconcilable situation between China and Japan. It is not necessary to go far to find other examples. Just take China's relationship with Britain. The Chinese people, of course, must strive to struggle to obtain true independence and equality from the aggression of imperialism. Britain, as the leader of imperialism, has all the unequal treaties with China that arose from the Opium War against Britain. In the beginning, Britain harmed us with deadly toxins, and then bound us with inescapable chains. This is a deep-rooted hatred in the bones of the Chinese people. If it is said that China's deteriorating relations with Japan have a history of more than ten years since the Twenty-One Demands, then its deteriorating relations with Britain have a history of more than eighty years. However, in China today, it can be said that anti-British sentiment is not very strong. This is, of course, because Britain has recently changed its opium policy. The biggest reason is that Britain has not had any territorial ambitions toward China in recent decades. What it has been engaged in is only in the commercial and economic fields. Therefore, as long as many unequal treaties can be corrected, China is willing to be friends with Britain for economic mutual benefit. If Japan only recognizes this point, it will know that China does not have a hundred-generation hatred concept. Whether it likes or dislikes, friends or enemies, can be completely shifted by facts. If Japan can truly abandon the act of territorial aggression, China is still willing to take Western countries as friends, let alone Japan, which is of the same continent and the same race? The entire Japan, as an Eastern nation, should understand Eastern psychology. The characteristics of Easterners, especially the Chinese, are that they value emotions, integrity, etiquette, and morality. Now, Japan's estimation of China's territory has extremely damaged Chinese emotions and dignity. To prevent China from seeking revenge, it is taking actions that violate morality. Even if China wants to cooperate with Japan, how can it endure such a humiliating form of cooperation? Japan sees Sino-Japanese relations too pessimistically, thinking that there is no hope of recovery. Therefore, Japan wants to put China to death in order to guard against it. Under this policy, Japan, on the one hand, uses various methods to exhaust China. It not only uses military force, but also directly and indirectly allows unscrupulous people to disturb the legal order in various parts of China and destroy China's good customs, in order to seek China's current death. On the other hand, it does not hesitate to use extremely cruel methods, attempting to harm and cut off the future life of the Chinese nation. The sale of heroin in various parts of China is mostly operated by Japanese merchants, or at least Japanese officials allow it. China has suffered from the harm of opium, and the health of the nation has been destroyed. Even today, although it has restored feelings for Britain, this hatred will be difficult to erase its traces for hundreds of generations. Japan is now following suit, and the poisoning is becoming more intense, which will make it difficult for future generations of China to forget. In order to eliminate China's retaliatory power, Japan is now also using ignorant Chinese traitors or warlord bureaucrats to hate and harm Chinese intellectuals. It does not know that Chinese intellectuals can never be completely eliminated. On this day, Japan is using the lowest-level traitors. These traitors will also become a major disaster for Japan in the future. To renege on one's words is the same. Moreover, what Japan deeply dislikes is the method of the Communist Party, and what it advocates is the characteristics of the Eastern nation. Now, Japan often wants to use the past boring warlords and bureaucrats in China to create Japanese-style politics in various places or to become puppet regimes of Japan. This matter is causing the Chinese people to recall the situation of the Third International, which wanted to create Russian-style politics in Wuhan and Guangzhou. After all, do Guangzhou or Wuhan still have traces of this kind of politics forcibly created by foreign forces? Isn't it because the public was indignant, rose up to expel them, and it was like a flash in the pan? We dare to tell Japan that the behavior that is most difficult for any national with characteristics and national consciousness to endure is the desire to eliminate its national character and historical culture. Eastern nations are nations that value morality. Easterners should value Eastern habits and thoughts. All methods that violate morality, use violent coercion, and are close to hypocrisy and cruelty are not methods that Easterners fear to tolerate. If Japan does not want to sow deep hatred for generations in China, I think it should reflect on itself calmly.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's error lies in treating China in the midst of revolution as a normal country, in mistakenly recognizing the twentieth century as the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and still adopting the methods or traditional policies of the previous century, in mistakenly recognizing revolutionary forces and treating them as remnants of the imperial era, in dealing with revolutionary strategies with the means of dealing with bureaucratic politics, and not realizing that Japan's military oppression can only coerce ignorant bureaucrats and warlords, but cannot subdue a nation whose nationalism is developing. On the other hand, it also considers the deterioration of relations between the two countries to be too pessimistic, and does not realize that it is not too far to stray. As long as it abandons military force and territorial aggression, it is very possible to improve the relations between the two countries and between the people.</p>
<h3 id="e114">6. Japanese Errors (2):：： <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Errors in Indirect Measures</p>
<p>The errors in Japan's understanding of China have been discussed above. Now, I would like to further point out the fallacies in the measures Japan has taken in dealing with international affairs. Since this article is written to discuss Sino-Japanese relations, it is limited to those caused by the China issue.</p>
<p>1.  The Error of Withdrawing from the League and Becoming Isolated Japan has created an irreversible situation in China. On the one hand, it rejects the advice of friendly countries, and on the other hand, it rejects the resolutions of the League of Nations, and even does not hesitate to withdraw from the League, which is a shocking move. As for Japan's own explanation, it is that Japan has its own independent stance. However, from an outsider's perspective, Japan verbally touts independence but actually achieves isolation. In fact, for Japan, independence is possible, but isolation is not. The current trend in the world is the trend of international cooperation. Almost no country is willing to be isolated outside of international groups. For example, regarding the League of Nations, the Soviet Union, a country with different doctrines, resolutely joined, and the United States also abandoned its traditional policy of non-cooperation and tended to join the League of Nations. Now Japan is in this period of withdrawing from international groups and is willing to be isolated. Tracing the reason, it is due to the desire to implement the annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia, the unification of East Asia, and the monopoly of the Pacific Ocean, but it does not know that it has completely fallen into the error of violating the trend of the times. In the world, only generally weak countries that have not yet completed the revolution have to advocate an independent stance and are willing to be isolated from international groups or treaties, because the national strength is unequal, and after joining, they cannot obtain equal status and interests, but only obligations and no rights, and it is better not to join; if in countries with an existing foundation, there is no one who voluntarily isolates themselves from international affairs. Before Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it sought advice from senior officials and scholars, which shows that it also considered the issue to be serious, but it could not stop, and finally made a resolute decision. Since Hirota came to power, although he has appointed himself to replace the restraints of the League of Nations with separate negotiations, Japan has not hesitated to cast a dark shadow on world peace. At a time when international relations are becoming increasingly close, it has created a position of being watched by the world, which is ultimately not the benefit of Japan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Yesterday, hosted the press.</p>
<p>Issued a declaration and a letter to the citizens.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Industrial and Commercial Research Society on the second floor of Taichangfang, Zhejiang Road, at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty people attended, and members of the association, including Wu Jiangdong, Hu Shaomei, and Zhu Jiandong, provided courteous hospitality on the scene. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Chairman's Report <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>First, Chairman Zheng Jianbo reported the purpose of the meeting and the significance of organizing this association, stating briefly that the purpose of the associates forming this association is to promote national products by setting an example, and to promote the consistent use of national products by all citizens of the city. Don’t just pay lip service, but do it in practice, to fulfill the national duty of the people. He stated that he had participated in the work of the Volunteer Army in the past, organized the Northeast Four Provinces Transportation Corps, all of which were patriotic movements. This time, forming an association to promote national products is also based on the concept of patriotism. Hard work is the key. In short, patriotic movements within the legal framework will not be obstructed by anyone and can proceed smoothly. He hoped that the press would provide assistance, etc. Then, Hu Shaomei and others gave speeches successively, and distributed national product cigarettes and refreshments produced by the China Merchants People's Tobacco Company before the meeting ended.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Declaration Issued <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The association issued a declaration yesterday, saying: Since the Opium War, China has traded with Western countries. Due to the restrictions of unequal treaties, tariffs are not independent, so that foreign goods can be imported with only a small amount of tariffs, and can be unimpeded. In recent years, the import of foreign goods has become more and more rampant, with an annual trade deficit of more than 300 million yuan. Natural disasters and man-made disasters at home have been frequent, and the rural economy has been bankrupted, and it is almost impossible to recover. In addition, the loss of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe has sharply reduced agricultural exports, and the purchasing power of the people is becoming increasingly low. Since 1920, the world economic depression has gradually spread around the globe, and industrial countries have launched economic struggles, devaluing currency prices, building tariff barriers, and dumping goods. As a result, Chinese markets are flooded with foreign goods, and domestic factories are in a world economic panic, and the collapse of the domestic rural economy, under the dual oppression, is already dying. It has also been attacked by the annexation policies of various countries, like fallen leaves swept away by the autumn wind. Therefore, the closure of industrial and commercial enterprises is almost daily, and the national economy is becoming more and more empty due to the large outflow of cash over the years. If this continues, the country will not be a country. However, if the skin is gone, what will the hair be attached to? The call for promoting national products by the people of the country, from the May 30th Movement to the present, has been working hard to implement it, and it has been popular for a while, but so far no results have been seen. It is only because the people's hearts are depraved, and they have been intoxicated with foreign goods for a long time, and they compete for luxury, and they are ashamed to use national products. Although the call for promoting national products has reached the clouds, due to the accumulated burden, it is still of no help. The associates, based on the late Premier’s teachings, in view of the creation of the New Life Movement, the failure of past promoters of national products, and for the sake of stabilizing the national economy and the prosperity of rural life, under the principle of self-sufficiency, developing domestic industry and commerce, in order to save the situation and stop the leakage. It is hoped that in the world economic depression, the country will survive. The associates have a patriotic heart, and they have no way to save the poor. They are willing to set an example, use national products, set the tone first, and advocate the trend. Therefore, the Shanghai Citizens National Products Association is organized to persuade all walks of life in the city to use national products. The associates do not feel ashamed of their own insignificance, and they are encouraged to encourage themselves, adhering to the courage to move forward, the spirit of perseverance, and strive to implement, to fulfill their national duties. I hope that all institutions, all groups, and people from all walks of life will guide them and work together to complete the work. Then the national industry will be fortunate, and the future of national products will really rely on it. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Letter to the Citizens <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The association respectfully informs the citizens, saying: Dear comrades and compatriots, in this world economic gloom that cages the Chinese national economy, it is exactly like being exposed to wind and rain, and the arrival of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident has shattered the Chinese people's attempt to gradually pass the prosperous illusion. In this critical moment of survival, we should use all our strength to reverse our own destiny. Living in a drunken life and dreaming of death is not how we can live our lives. The paper image of singing and dancing has been torn apart by the power of the times. Now the Dongcha incident is another powerful bomb. The collapse of the national rural economy, the various problems of banditry and foreign insults, all have the possibility of turning us from a semi-colonial place into a non-two-price colony. And judging from the trade reports of the customs over the years, since the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it has been necessary to average more than 300 to 400 million yuan every year. This big leak tightens us and falls into a position of eternal doom. Compatriots, please don’t be infatuated anymore and rely on the strength of others to consolidate yourself. There is absolutely no such beautiful ideal in the world that can become a reality. We must understand that "only our own strength can save ourselves." This is an unchanging rule for thousands of years. The associates feel the current crisis in China, and individual abilities are weak. Therefore, we want to start with our own practical and effective self-help methods, that is, to use national products in our daily life, restore rights, and strive to develop national industry and commerce and survive under the self-sufficient nationalist economy. Compatriots, I hope that with the power of the public, we can support the growth of our small contribution, and in Shanghai, which holds the economic lifeline of the whole country, we can reap great results. Compatriots who are determined to save the country, please be able to implement it faithfully, swear faithfully, and everyone rises up together to protect the beloved motherland of the Republic of China!</p>

<p>The China Aviation Association, in order to give the people of the country a deep understanding of aviation to save the country, has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications, ordering the Shanghai Postal Administration to add the four characters "Aviation Saves the Country" to each letter on January 28th.

<h3 id="e129">From February 1st <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Silk fabrics will be increased in price.</p>
<p>Because the price of silk has skyrocketed, the sales are not enough to cover the cost.</p>
<p>The price increase method will be determined by each gang.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Fabrics United Association, in view of the current economic depression, declining sales, and sharp drop in prices, coupled with the soaring price of silk, resulting in sales that are almost insufficient to cover the cost, has repeatedly received letters from various silk fabric guilds in the two provinces, requesting a public announcement of price increases. Therefore, a joint meeting was held on the 19th of this month and it was resolved that all silk fabrics would be increased in price uniformly from February 1st. The method of price increase will be determined by each gang. The price increase notices of each association are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">United Association Announcement <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>For the matter of announcement, I recently received reports from various silk fabrics guilds in the two provinces, saying that the current price of silk has skyrocketed (factory silk has increased by 40 cents, and local silk has increased by 20 cents). As a result, the cost of silk fabrics has increased, and the sales price is too disparate. It should be discussed publicly, etc. In view of this, the association convened representatives of silk industry guilds from Jiangsu and Zhejiang on the 19th of this month for a joint meeting. It was publicly decided to publish in the newspaper that all silk fabrics will be increased in price uniformly from February 1st of this year. However, the situation of each gang is different, and the announcement should be published by each gang's guild, etc., recorded on file. Corresponding to the discussion, publish the announcement as above, I hope you will see it.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Electrical Machinery Industry Price Increase <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>It is found that the decline of the silk weaving industry in this city is entirely due to the impact of the tragic drop in the price of goods. In recent years, especially the soaring price of silk has increased by more than 40 cents, resulting in excessively high costs of making goods and heavy losses in secret. Colleagues feel the pain, which is really unbearable to imagine. In order to rectify the market price of fabrics and maintain the survival of the industry, this association convened the ninth executive committee meeting on January 19 and resolved that the spring plate of each goods will be increased by 30 cents for pure silk fabrics and 15 cents for artificial silk interwoven fabrics in accordance with the original price, in order to maintain costs. In addition, at this time of economic depression and tight monetary supply, all customer transaction funds must be cleared completely at the end of the month, so as to circulate funds and avoid excessive secret losses. All our colleagues, whether members or non-members, should strictly abide by the record on file. In addition to the separate letter, a special record is announced. Please understand that the customers of each gang will be allocated goods afterwards, and I hope you will do so, Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association.</p>

<p>Professor Siren arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Hoping to complete his early history of Chinese painting.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Professor Siren, an employee of the National Museum of Stockholm, Sweden, has been studying Chinese art for many years and is known as an authority in the contemporary art world. He arrived in Shanghai last Friday. Mr. Siren has been away from China for more than five years, and this time he intends to continue his research on Chinese language, history, and civilization, in order to complete his great work "Early History of Chinese Painting." The two volumes he wrote about paintings from the early Han Dynasty to the late Yuan Dynasty have been published in London. Commentators say that his dedication to Chinese art and his profound attainments surpass those of ancient and modern times. Mr. Siren said that since he left China, his Chinese has become rusty, and he has come again to review his old lessons. However, when he was stationed in Stockholm, he spent almost all his time reading and translating famous works of art and painting from the Tang and Song dynasties. He also said that Chinese painting emphasizes spirituality and does not emphasize ornamentation, just like music to us. China only had art after it broke away from copying nature. Chinese art is actually painting to write thoughts and express feelings. According to Mr. Siren, he recently traveled from Vietnam. When he was in Vietnam, the French authorities guided him to visit the Hanoi Museum and the sites where ancient monuments were excavated in Tokyo. Tokyo used to be a Chinese vassal state, so there are many ancient works of art with Chinese style. Recently, exquisite Han tombs have been discovered, which archaeologists are paying close attention to.</p>

After arriving in Shanghai, Jiang will not stay long and will immediately go to Nanjing to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on everything.</p>

<p>To Nanjing this morning and return to Jinan</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, Zhang Honglie, a member of the Shandong Provincial Committee and Director of Construction, came to Shanghai to consult with the industrial and commercial circles of this city on investing in Shandong Province to carry out construction projects. Yesterday morning, Lin Kanghou and Zou Bingwen of the banking industry visited Mr. Zhang to make the final discussion. Now the general plan has been decided. Mr. Zhang will take the special express train from Shanghai to Nanjing at 8:00 this morning to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and contact the Ministry of Railways to purchase the Boshan light railway. After staying in Nanjing for two or three days, he will go north to Jinan. The reporter of the Daily News visited Mr. Zhang at the inn yesterday morning and made the following conversation:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Investment Initially Set at 800,000 <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, and Zou Bingwen, Standing Committee Member of the Cotton Control Committee, visited Mr. Zhang successively at around 10:00 yesterday morning to make the final discussion on investing in Shandong Province to carry out various construction projects. According to Mr. Zhang, the general plan has now been completed. Regarding the siphon siltation project, Yao Tichang, a leader of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, went to Jinan to inspect it a few days ago. Mr. Yao has now taken the plan back to Shanghai and is having in-depth consultations with the banking industry. They all think it is satisfactory. Approximately 800,000 will be invested first, and the Daoxu area on the south bank of the Yellow River, that is, the junction of Putai and Boxing, will be selected to start the project first.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Purchasing the Boshan Light Railway <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the plan to purchase the Boshan light railway, because the Boshan area is rich in coal, the railway is privately owned, and its freight is usually eight or nine times more expensive than usual. Therefore, national coal cannot be developed. The Shandong Provincial Government has realized this, so it has asked the Ministry of Railways to bid for the railway from the Jiaoji Railway, and plans to extend the railway to Laiwu.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Appointing Ge Guangting to Confer in Nanjing <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>As for the purchase price, the price offered by the company is very high, originally 1.5 million yuan, but has now been reduced to 1 million yuan. The government has offered 800,000 yuan. Because Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways was recuperating in Shanghai, I had a discussion with Vice Minister Zeng (Zhongming) in Nanjing, and there were some clues. However, this matter requires Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, to jointly discuss everything. I have telegraphed to Ge, who arrived in Nanjing on the 24th. After I arrive in Nanjing tomorrow, I can start discussing the specific methods. It is expected to be successful in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e139">To Nanjing this morning and transfer back to Jinan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>As for the small Qing River dredging funds, after I discussed with Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission, the full amount of 2 million yuan will be allocated in three phases. The first phase of 900,000 yuan will be allocated 400,000 yuan in the 23rd year, and the remaining 500,000 yuan will be allocated under the 24th year budget. The task of this trip has been completed. It has been decided to take the early train to Nanjing tomorrow morning (that is, this morning), because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has an appointment, and I will visit Nanjing again to discuss matters. After staying in Nanjing for two or three days, I will return to Jinan from Nanjing.</p>

<p>Actively planning agricultural relief.</p>
<p>Continuing to hire inspectors in six provinces.</p>
<p>Designing the distribution of spring planting seeds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drought Relief Association for various provinces has been increasingly busy with relief work recently due to the arrival of severe winter. Furthermore, at a recent standing committee meeting, it was decided to plan the distribution of spring planting seeds in disaster areas next spring, and appointed newly hired foreign consultant Baker to be responsible for the design, so that in addition to work relief and emergency relief, agricultural relief can be carried out. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Baker and Eight Others Design Agricultural Relief <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The severity of the disaster situation in various provinces last year was rarely seen in the last sixty years. After the establishment of the Drought Relief Association, in addition to the work relief being handled by the local authorities in each province to issue bonds or raise funds, the emergency relief was the responsibility of the central government and the association to raise funds and handle it. Now it has been gradually implemented. The most important thing is agricultural relief. Now, after investigation by the association, the disaster areas in various provinces are vast, and there is no grass in the farmland. In a blink of an eye, the spring plowing season is approaching, and the need for seeds is very urgent. The distribution of seeds must not be delayed. Therefore, the newly hired consultant Baker, as well as Chu Huiseng, Quan Shaowu, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Bodu, Li Dachao, and Huang Yinzhou were elected to be responsible for the design. According to Mr. Chu Huiseng yesterday, the previous report that a seed research committee was organized was not true. The purpose of the current work is to plan agricultural relief, and there is no need to delay the research. Baker is currently investigating whether there is a surplus from the previous customs surtax and the US wheat loan, in order to report to the association as a reference for designing agricultural relief.</p>

<p>After the association successively assigned investigation and relief personnel to work in the disaster areas of various provinces, the directors of each investigation and relief successively reported the work situation to the association. In order to understand the relief work in various disaster areas and supervise and urge them, President Kong specially appointed inspectors to visit the provinces. In addition to Cheng Yiqing and Feng Yangshan, who have been appointed to inspect Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Wan Shuxi was appointed as the inspector of Anhui, Ye Jingcong was appointed as the inspector of Jiangxi, Shen Zuoding was appointed as the inspector of Hunan, Liu Guidian was appointed as the inspector of Hubei, and Huang Zhenying was appointed as the inspector of Henan and Hebei provinces. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the directors of investigation and relief in various provinces, urging them to strictly follow the principles of investigation and relief, strictly eliminate and relax, and report the actual situation of each county as soon as possible, so that it can be announced and the society can know it.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Relief Association Reply Regarding Tax Exemption Matters <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Relief Committee, yesterday consulted with the Railway Ministry regarding tax exemption for advance shipment of relief supplies, replied to the association in a letter stating: (Official title omitted) With reference to your association's previous letter, regarding the purchase of rice, flour, and cotton clothing for distribution in disaster areas, requesting the Railway Ministry be petitioned to issue a general order to all railway bureaus, that relief goods transported by your association, whether relief grain or relief clothing, be uniformly exempted from taxes and shipped in advance, etc., the matter was forwarded to the Railway Ministry for consideration and reply. We have now received a letter from the Railway Ministry, Reference Character 業, No. 100, dated January 22 of this year, stating that the request for a general order for free shipment of relief clothing and relief grain is inconsistent with regulations and cannot be granted. Upon investigation, rice and flour are fine grains and not included in the relief goods listed in Article 2 of the Railway Transport Relief Goods Regulations. However, the shipment of relief clothing or coarse grains can be handled in accordance with Article 3 of the said regulations, charged at 50% of the ordinary freight rate in cash. However, the type, quantity, and starting and ending stations, etc., should be listed in detail and forwarded in advance for verification and preparation for transport. Please check and inform accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Director Liang Shanglian of the Ministry of Industry's Commerce Department Speaks On <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Policies for Relief</p>
<p>Implementing Control and Promoting with the Entire Political Power</p>
<p>Passively Promoting Domestic Goods, Actively Utilizing Customs Policies</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the economic downturn, the nation's commerce is on the verge of bankruptcy. A reporter from the Daily News recently (the 25th) specially interviewed Liang Shanglian, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry, to inquire about the content of the Ministry's relief plan. Mr. Liang then gave the following statement:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Causes of Bankruptcy <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The causes of China's commercial downturn are extremely complex. To list the main ones, there are approximately several points: ㈠ The rural economy is bankrupt, and society has lost its purchasing power. ㈡ Domestic production is lagging behind, and there is an annual trade deficit, with much of society's circulating money being absorbed by foreigners and taken away. ㈢ International trade is underdeveloped, and the domestic market is mostly seized by foreign goods. ㈣ All products have lost their ability to be regulated. ㈤ In the past, foreign capital could not penetrate the interior due to underdeveloped transportation, but now they are using their superior transportation power to gradually expand and reach the countryside. ㈥ The customs has no power to manipulate and utilize [policies]. The above six points involve a very wide scope, so it is not a simple problem, and simple relief measures alone cannot be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Relief Methods <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Minister Chen (Gongbo) is very concerned about providing relief to national commerce. I myself am also very interested in research and have had lengthy and thorough discussions. I feel that the fundamental solution must start with control and must gather the entire power of the government to make overall plans, taking everything into consideration. Superficially observing relief methods, they only belong to the Ministry of Industry, and at most are related to the Ministry of Finance, but in reality, many areas are involved, such as railways, transportation, foreign affairs, and even military agencies, which are all closely related to this issue. In my personal opinion, this overall relief plan must be decided upon in principle by the Central Political Council, and then distributed to the relevant agencies for joint handling, so that it can be implemented with the highest political power in order to seek a complete solution. Localized action may not be of much benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Commerce in Various Places <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>This year, commerce in various parts of the country has been shrouded in the shadow of the economic downturn. Places such as Tianjin, Beiping, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Hankou, etc., are generally in the same situation. Rui Zengxiang, a store in Beiping that has been open for more than 200 years, has had its foundations shaken and is now being maintained by the Chamber of Commerce. In other places, many stores have also closed down and have been given relief by local political or commercial groups. Although this is not a fundamental solution, there seems to be no other perfect plan besides using this method. Last year, the overall business situation for stores in Shanghai was also mostly a case of losses exceeding profits. The declarations of liquidation or temporary closure of various companies are clear evidence of this. Others, such as flour mills and yarn factories, although occasionally there are profits, in essence, they are not true profits from the commercial enterprises themselves, but profits from commercial policies. The blow they have received is partly due to the economic downturn, but also partly due to the import and dumping of foreign goods. For example, the year before last, the national cotton harvest was abundant, but prices rose sharply. Last year, cotton production decreased, but prices fell instead. This is clear evidence of this. According to Gu Xinyi, manager of the Shanghai Grain Exchange, last year Shanghai ordered and imported a total of six million bags of foreign rice, worth seventy or eighty million yuan, which were all sold in the interior. With such a huge amount of money flowing out, society suddenly lost its ability to utilize it, and commerce naturally suffered a major impact. Shanghai's commerce is on the verge of bankruptcy, which is not due to this one reason alone, but it is also an important cause.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Promoting Domestic Goods <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Promoting domestic goods is originally one of the methods for revitalizing commerce, but the word "promoting" is actually passive, not active. Passive methods have very little effect. Foreign goods can use dumping policies as a tool to break through. Active methods must rely on the use of customs policies, which is not permissible in the current situation. Therefore, although passive methods have little effect, they seem to be slightly better than no method at all.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shanxi Example <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Finally, when the reporter asked about Shanxi's economic control policies, Mr. Liang said that Shanxi's economic control had achieved considerable results, the most notable of which was the cigarette industry. Self-sufficiency was achieved, and the entry of foreign cigarettes was prohibited. Later, after protests from British and American companies, a compromise was reached, allowing the import of several hundred boxes per year, but the quantity was quite small.</p>

<p>Jiangxi Provincial Government Chairman Xiong Shihui, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, has been very busy socializing with various circles in this city these past few days. Mr. Xiong has determined that Jiangxi provincial affairs urgently need to be handled, so he is scheduled to enter Beijing in the next few days with Gong Xuesui, Director of the Provincial Department of Construction, to meet with Chairman Chiang again, and then return to Jiangxi. It is also understood that during this trip to Shanghai, he contacted the banking sector in this city to discuss loan matters for the Jiangxi hydropower plant, and has achieved considerable results.</p>

<p>Suiyuan Provincial Government Chairman Fu Zuoyi, because Suiyuan Province has always been a barren region, and political, cultural, educational, construction, and other undertakings are relatively backward, Chairman Fu has striven to improve them in recent years. Recently, he specially appointed Fan Ku, Director of the Provincial People's Education Hall, as the province's political inspector, to come to various provinces in the interior for inspection. The inspection period is set at six months, and the results of the inspection will be compiled into a report to serve as a reference for the province's local political facilities. Mr. Fan arrived in Shanghai yesterday and took a train to Hangzhou today. He will stay in Zhejiang for about half a month, then return to Zhejiang Province for inspection, and then travel through Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces, returning to Suiyuan along the Pinghan Railway.</p>

<p>According to information from the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office, the Ministry of Finance, because the customs administration systems of various European and American countries have many aspects that can be used as a model, has decided to send Ding Guitang, Customs Inspector of the General Taxation Section of the Inspectorate General of Customs, as a special commissioner to inspect the customs administration of various European and American countries, so that after returning to the country, he can plan improvements to China's customs administration. After receiving the order, Mr. Ding is actively preparing for the various procedures for going abroad for inspection and is expected to be able to depart in mid-February. The inspection period has been set at six months.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Plans to Formulate <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Rural Cooperation Experiment Zone Plan</p>
<p>To Save the Rural Economy from Recession</p>
<p>Designating Yinhang District for Pilot Implementation</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to save the rural economy from recession, and following the precedents of Denmark and other countries, has formulated a rural cooperation experiment zone plan and submitted it to the municipal government for approval. Once approved by the municipal government, it will be implemented according to the plan. The original text of the plan is excerpted below:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Location <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The selection of a location is extremely important, and the following points should be noted: ㈠ The local farmers must have a higher level of knowledge and education must be more common (the vicinity of a location with a rural school is most suitable). ㈡ The location must be a central location, with convenient transportation, and easy to connect with other villages and towns. ㈢ The scope of the area should be within three to five li, and should not be too broad. ㈣ Based on the above reasons, it is proposed to designate Yinhang District for pilot implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Organization <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The experiment zone will be directly under the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, with cooperative instructors from the bureau rotating to work in the district. A Cooperative Experiment Zone Promotion Committee will also be organized, composed of local elementary school principals, municipal committee members, representatives of farmers' associations, and impartial people who are enthusiastic about the peasant movement, to handle various cooperative undertakings in the district and be responsible for promotion and organization (the charter will be formulated separately).</p>
<h3 id="e158">Survey <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>㈠ The survey methods will be divided into individual surveys and overall surveys. Individual surveys will cover matters such as the personal, family, living, and economic conditions of individuals. Overall surveys will cover matters such as the organization, production, and education of a village or township. The most important thing to note during the survey is the attitude of the surveyors, which should be amiable and approachable, and the language should be simple and easy to understand. ㈡ The survey materials will list the various materials needed in the form of tables and fill them out separately. The most important ones are divided into eleven categories: 1. Table of Economic Income and Expenditure of Farmers' Families for One Year; 2. Table of Production Conditions of Farmers' Families; 3. Table of Education Level of Farmers' Families; 4. Table of General Conditions of Farmland and Agricultural Production of Farmers' Families; 5. Table of Sideline Business Operations of Farmers' Families; 6. Table of Social Organization Conditions in Rural Areas; 7. Table of Educational Undertakings in Rural Areas; 8. Table of Production Conditions in Rural Areas; 9. Table of Economic Organization Conditions in Rural Areas; 10. Table of Sales and Purchase Conditions in Rural Areas; 11. Table of Customs and Habits in Rural Areas.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Propaganda <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>After the survey, propaganda work must be carried out. The organization of this propaganda must go through a long period of cultivation and influence, and cannot be effective with just a few words. It is planned to implement two aspects of propaganda: language and written. ㈠ Written Propaganda: Print the essence, benefits, and organizational methods of cooperative undertakings into booklets, slogans, and short articles, or pictures, etc., and distribute them to each household or post them in various places, so that farmers can have a deep understanding and knowledge. ㈡ Language Propaganda: Open-air speeches, roving propaganda, convening representatives of farmers from the entire district for talks.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Guidance <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After the propaganda, guide their organization. Regarding guidance matters, the important ones are described below: 1. Guide them in preparing to establish a cooperative society. 2. Guide them in drafting the charter. 3. Guide them in the procedures for establishing a cooperative society. 4. Guide the society's business plan. 5. Guide the society's business direction. 6. Other guidance matters.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Organization <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The rural situation in this city is slightly different from the interior, so the undertakings of its organization should be determined with reference to the actual situation. It is planned to first carry out those that are practical and suitable for the rural environment of this district. Regarding the organizational methods, it is planned to adopt a multi-business approach, operating the following undertakings so that they can develop mutually: ㈠ Rural Credit Cooperation: Rural areas in our country have always lacked sound economic organizations. Urban banks are mostly too busy to care about them, and pawnshops and pawnshops often engage in exploitation and usury. Other institutions such as money clubs also inevitably have certain shortcomings and abuses. Credit cooperatives are the most complete rural economic organization, and they have two advantages: 1. They can provide small loans in installments; 1. They can absorb small deposits in installments, thereby connecting the activities of the rural economy, cultivating the virtues of diligence and thrift, and eliminating the exploitation of high-interest loans. ㈡ Rural Sales and Purchase Cooperation: Farmers' various supplies are mostly purchased indirectly from intermediaries, and the prices and quality of goods are often deceived. As for the sale of agricultural products, because the quantity is small, they cannot directly trade with factories, and trading and transportation are inconvenient. Every time they are monopolized by unscrupulous merchants and peddlers, the losses of farmers are even greater. Now, if we want to obtain low-priced and high-quality goods and eliminate the monopoly of intermediaries, organizing purchasing and sales cooperatives can obtain various benefits. ㈢ Rural Grain Storage Cooperation: The theory of storing grain for disaster prevention has recently become widespread, but the fundamental method is to organize a grain storage cooperative. It benefits oneself and others, uses each other, and there is no fear of disaster. It can also regulate the quantity and price of the market so that it will not be manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. ㈣ Rural Side Occupations: Natural disasters and man-made disasters are difficult to predict. Preventing them before they happen requires proactive measures. Otherwise, once a disaster strikes, they will become starving corpses. Therefore, farmers should also engage in other side occupations in addition to agricultural work, such as weaving, raising fish, pigs, chickens, ducks, knitting handicrafts, etc., to make up for the inadequacy of the income from their main occupation, and sometimes it is greater than the main income from agriculture, which should be promoted and organized as soon as possible. Regarding agricultural production cooperatives, the use of cooperatives is planned to be promoted in the second step.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Training <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>All good systems, without suitable talents, cannot have excellent performances. The people of our country lack sufficient understanding of the cooperative system. Once they are rashly asked to handle it, it will naturally be difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the cultivation of talents cannot be delayed. Therefore, a cooperative business lecture hall or training class is attached to this district to train cooperative talents and increase the development of cooperative businesses.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Supervision <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the cooperative societies in various places recently, many abuses have occurred. Their organization is not sound, and a lack of supervision is also one of the important reasons. Therefore, after the establishment of a cooperative society, the supervision method should be strict. The cooperative society should report the various conditions in the society once a month. The competent authority will send personnel to supervise the business situation and accounting books at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Joint Association of Machinery Industries <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Special Committee Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>New Sound News reports: After the French Concession Public Works Department overstepped its authority in managing Chinese factories and announced that it would refuse our factory inspection, the Joint Association of Machinery Industries launched the organization of a special committee and nominated 13 members. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held today, but because it is the end of the accounting period, and businesses are extremely busy, the association has decided to postpone the meeting. Furthermore, Joint Association of Machinery Industries General Secretary Cheng Shouchong, regarding the Motor Vehicle Management Regulations promulgated by the French Concession, specially visited Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter and plans to further study it with various industrial and commercial experts in order to contribute to the special committee, using it as a reference for negotiations.</p>

<p>Agreed to Resume Business Today</p>
<p>All Branches Will Operate as Usual</p>
<p>Jicheng Pharmacy on Nanjing Road, after the board of directors decided to temporarily suspend business, formulated a settlement plan and submitted it to the shareholders' meeting on January 12, which was unanimously approved, allowing the business to resume on or before January 25, provided that the consent of more than three-quarters of the creditors was obtained. The general deputy manager and key staff of the pharmacy made individual contacts and, as a result, reached an understanding far exceeding three-quarters of the required amount well before the deadline. However, due to cumbersome procedures and the need for time to prepare, it was decided to resume business on the 28th of this month. All branches will operate as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Jiang Jiangshi Requests <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Changsheng to Return to the Clan</p>
<p>Filing a Lawsuit to Confirm Parentage</p>
<p>Qiu Weiqing, who started his business by operating pigments, left a substantial inheritance after his death, all of which is controlled by his son, Qiu Changsheng. Two years ago, Qiu's family members, due to disputes over property division, sued Changsheng in the First Special District Local Court, stating that Changsheng was not Weiqing's biological son, but a foster child since childhood. The lawsuit lasted for a long time and was eventually settled through mediation. Now, Jiang Jiangshi, a 65-year-old woman from Jiangdu, has come forward to admit that Changsheng was born to her and asked Changsheng to recognize his ancestors, thus confirming the question of whether Changsheng is Weiqing's biological son. However, Changsheng is now enjoying a life of affluence and will not abandon his wealthy status to follow a poor woman back to her hometown. He absolutely denies that Jiang Jiangshi is his biological mother. The woman presented a petition to the First Special Court, claiming that a son should not be ungrateful and could not forget his parents' boundless kindness. She stated that her late husband, Xianxiang, due to the decline of the family and the difficulty of raising children, entrusted his biological son Changsheng to Qiu Weiqing in the same village with the introduction of Mr. Xu Zhen, a director of the village, in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Later, the Qiu family took their family and Changsheng to Shanghai for business, and her late husband died soon after. The second son also died. At that time, she knew that the Qiu family already had children, so she came to Shanghai in August of the 21st year to have Changsheng return to the clan. At that time, the Qiu family was experiencing domestic disputes, and it was difficult for Changsheng to move elsewhere. She was persuaded by mediators to postpone it for one or two years, which she thought was reasonable, so she let it be delayed until today. Unexpectedly, Changsheng has recently turned against her and acted as if they were strangers. Considering her age and her eagerness to see her son, she petitioned the court to summon Changsheng for mediation and persuade him to return to the clan in order to preserve the bloodline of the Jiang family. The court has already held a hearing for mediation, but because it was ineffective, Jiang Jiangshi hired attorney Chen Daxun to file a lawsuit to confirm parentage. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi summoned the defendant for trial, but he failed to appear. Jiang Jiangshi stated the circumstances of the Qiu family's adoption and the circumstances of being persuaded to postpone the order to return to the clan in Shanghai the year before last. Bu Shaoru and lawyer Wang Siji, gentry and merchants from Jiangdu who were traveling in Shanghai, both participated in the mediation and asked to summon the two men to the case, which would be able to prove [the truth]. Judge Peng then ordered a change of date to summon the witnesses for further questioning.</p>

<p>Thieves Opened Fire and Resisted Arrest</p>
<p>Vigilant Members of the Defense Corps Surrounded and Arrested</p>
<p>Seven Thieves Escaped, Factory Did Not Suffer Any Losses</p>
<p>At about 4 a.m. yesterday morning, seven armed thieves at the Huadong Manufacturing Factory at the intersection of the Lincolns Branch Road in Xinjing, Northwest Shanghai, pulled open the bamboo fence gate and sneaked in, then broke the glass window and climbed into the factory, going straight to the bedrooms of the factory manager Huang Xishan and others. All the employees were awakened. Just as the thieves were about to commit robbery, they were spotted by a passerby outside the factory, who reported the thieves' actions to Gong Yifei, a member of the First Defense Team of the Puzong District Gongjiazhai Defense Corps. After receiving the report, Gong immediately led eight armed corps members to the Huadong Manufacturing Factory to surround and arrest the thieves. Knowing that things were not going well, the thieves turned around and rushed to escape, taking the initiative to fire a pistol to resist arrest and demonstrate. Corps member Gong and others followed them in the dark, chasing and arresting them all the way, and also fired three shots in retaliation, but fortunately no one was injured. As a result, the thieves took the opportunity to flee east along the Lincoln Road without a trace. Afterwards, the factory reported the incident to Wang Dasui, Director of the Caojiadu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who sent personnel to investigate. After receiving the report, Director Wang sent Inspector Long to investigate. The factory did not suffer any losses and reported the incident to the headquarters for record.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Murder of Indian Constable Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Witnesses Summoned to Court</p>
<p>Two Indian Constables and a Teahouse Worker Testified in Court</p>
<p>Luo Xinfa Stated Insistently That It Was Someone Named Bao</p>
<p>At 10:45 p.m. on the ninth day of the tenth month of last year, Indian Constable No. 258 of the Public Concession Police was patrolling the Hejian Road when he was shot and killed in a vital area. Afterwards, Chinese Detectives Liu Wenzao and Su Yinggen arrested two suspects, Zhou Hongtian and Wang Jinsheng, both from Taizhou. Wang confessed that the pistol used to shoot the Indian constable belonged to Wang Jinfa (i.e., Luo Xinfa), a thief arrested by the French Concession. The pistol was then brought in and verified to be genuine. The two criminals, Zhou and Wang, were escorted to the First Special District Court and interrogated several times. Initially, they pushed the blame on each other, but then they jointly retracted their confessions, claiming that the real murderer was someone named Bao who was on the run. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan visited the Criminal Third Court for investigation. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated that today there are two Indian constables and a teahouse worker from Room 20 of the Huidong Hotel on Route Doumer, where the defendant stayed before the incident, to testify. Luo Xinfa also made a proposal. According to Luo, the pistol from the White Russia Road robbery case in the French Concession was handed over to him near the Great World by someone named Bao, who was on the run, on the evening of December 16 of last year, and he went to rob with Wang Jinsheng. He did not know about the shooting of the Indian constable. The court read out the words from his confession in the Second Special Court that the pistol was given to Wang Jinsheng and handed over at the corner of White Russia Road, and Zhou went to rob. Luo replied that he was being falsely accused. According to Indian Constable Dai Jiaxing, who was a horse patrolman, he was patrolling the area when he saw Indian Constable No. 258 lying on the ground after being shot. He was still able to speak and said that he was shot in the back by a robber. According to Da Jiaxing, who worked as a supervisor at a factory at No. 55 Huaji Road, he rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and Indian Constable No. 256 was already sleeping on the ground. He said that he was robbed and injured by a Chinese person who fled, and did not say how many people there were. According to Yin Ziwen, a teahouse worker at the Huidong Hotel, the two defendants came with a man and a woman on the 3rd of this month and stayed in Room 20. They left early and returned late. They went out on the evening of the 9th and did not know when they returned to the hotel. When questioned, the two defendants insisted that the one who shot the Indian constable that night was Bao, and the rest of their confessions were vague. Judge Wu ordered them to be taken back into custody and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>Constructing the Xicheng Road Project</p>
<p>The Xicheng Highway is the only transportation route between Wuxi and Jiangyin. It has been contracted by the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company, which specializes in operating long-distance buses. The business is relatively developed, but the roadbed construction is not solid, and maintenance is not good, resulting in the roadbed collapsing and being uneven. Whenever it rains, the wheels turn into muddy ditches. In addition, the company's vehicles are old and often have accidents such as overturning and injuring people. Transportation has not yet been perfected. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, seeing this, has specially allocated funds to build a macadam road surface. Now, the Xihu Road Engineering Office is handling it nearby. According to the person in charge of the Xihu Road Engineering Office, since the road started construction in early December of last year, the project has been progressing rapidly. The section from Wuxi to Yanqiao can be completely paved within the month. Travelers are all praising the change from rugged to smooth. However, due to poor maintenance, the original roads and ditches on both sides have been occupied by villagers, who are farming mulberry and wheat. As a result, when the road surface is being built, the villagers often misunderstand that the mulberry and wheat are being damaged, causing disputes. In fact, the land on both sides of the roadbed was originally the roads and ditches for the earth base, which have been measured and priced by the Wuxi County Government and belong to the roadbed area.</p>

<p>Flower Association Offender Xu Changrong</p>
<p>Cash Guarantee of Four Thousand Yuan Confiscated</p>
<p>Xu Changrong, a local resident nicknamed "Xu Xiaokai," was the accountant for a large flower association. In the autumn of the 22nd year [of the Republic], he was arrested by the French police and transferred to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. After investigation, he was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, with a fine of two thousand yuan. Xu, dissatisfied, repeatedly appealed to the High Third Branch Court and the Supreme Court, hoping to reduce his sentence. The Supreme Court upheld the original judgment. During the appeal period, Xu was detained in the detention center. Due to illness, he applied for suspension of detention and was released on bail for medical treatment. After examination by a doctor appointed by the High Third Branch Court, Xu was allowed to provide a cash guarantee of four thousand yuan and a shop guarantee to ensure his availability for questioning. Xu's family then paid the deposit and found a shop guarantor to bail him out. Now Xu learned of the final judgment of the Supreme Court, still unconvinced. He submitted another petition to the High Third Branch Court, requesting a retrial. It is now learned that the High Third Branch Court received the judgment and case files from the Supreme Court. The execution division issued a warrant to Xu Changrong to appear in court for execution the day before yesterday. Xu still claimed to be ill and receiving treatment in the hospital, refusing to appear.

<p>Wax Paper Stencil Printing Successful</p>
<p>The Yu-style Chinese typewriter, which has been granted a patent certificate by the Ministry of Industry, has been repeatedly improved. It uses steel-cast characters, with a hardness approaching that of copper. The machine is sensitive, and with a little practice, one can type thirty characters per minute, making sixteen copies at once. Recent experiments have shown that typing on dual-purpose wax paper and printing with a mimeograph machine can produce tens of thousands of copies, and the text remains clear. It is extremely suitable for schools to mimeograph lecture notes and announcements, being the most economical and efficient method. It has been purchased by Central, China, Agricultural and Industrial, Continental, Dazhong, Xinhua, Zhejiang Industrial, and other banks, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and various national agencies, law schools, and commercial firms, with over five hundred units adopted. Those who have purchased it have praised it unanimously. It is heard that the inventor, Mr. Yu Jun Binqi, in order to popularize this tool for improving culture, is offering a special discount of 15% off the list price of three hundred yuan to purchasers, including all shipping fees for distant locations, and a ten-year warranty. If the typewriter is returned after ten years, it is still worth one hundred yuan. The manufacturing plant is located at 622 Zhoujiazui Road, Shanghai. Those who wish to visit or request samples are most welcome.</p>

<p>Debate Concluded, Defendant Remanded Pending Decision</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a native of Henan, age 27, and his 18-year-old younger brother Zhang,</p>
<p>Lived in the attic room of the three-story building owned by Old Woman Dai Chen of Ningbo, at number 24. Guanghua worked at the Shanghai Navigation Bureau on the Sichuan Road Enterprise Bank building. On November 22nd of last year, he took a break from work. Zhang Guanghua returned home and told the sub-letter he was ending the lease. He was preparing to return to his hometown, unexpectedly that night Zhang Guangzhou was suddenly killed by having his neck severed. Zhang Guanghua also suffered knife wounds to his head and jumped out of the window, shouting for help. The sub-letter contacted police, who brought Guanghua to the police station and transferred him to the hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the police sent Guangzhou's body to the coroner's office. After verification by the court, as there were no other relatives in Shanghai, the body was buried by the charity hall. After Guanghua's knife wounds healed, he was brought back to the police station for investigation. The results showed that the deceased Guangzhou tried to kill his elder brother with a knife, and Guanghua seized the knife and killed him in self-defense. Guanghua was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court, and the police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution for murder. Judge Xiong Huiping held repeated hearings. Zhang Guanghua vehemently denied killing his younger brother and hired a lawyer to defend him. For the sake of caution, the judge personally went to the scene of the incident to investigate and brought all the books and documents from Zhang's house to the court for strict review, rescheduling the hearing. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiong held another hearing. The defendant's testimony was the same as in previous hearings. At this point, the court considered the investigation of facts and evidence to be complete and ordered the start of the debate. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi and the defendant's defense lawyer debated with each other for an hour. The court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 30th. The defendant was still remanded pending the decision.</p>

<h3 id="e188">National Mining Association Seeks Members' Opinions <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>On Banning Unlicensed Small Mines</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Agrees to Formulate Careful Banning Measures</p>
<p>Hoping Everyone Will Contribute as Much as Possible for Review</p>
<p>The Industrial Association says that the National Mining Association, according to proposals from its members, the United Office of China Fu companies, Zou Le, Jinbei, Baojin, and other coal mining companies, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to rigorously formulate measures to ban unlicensed small mines, in order to maintain mining rights and ensure safety. However, the mining areas of each are different, and the situations also vary. To understand the crux of the matter, an on-the-ground investigation is necessary. The Ministry of Industry, in view of the deep and great future of the overall mining industry development, has instructed the association to ask its members for detailed opinions, collect them, and submit them to the ministry for reference and review. After receiving the Ministry of Industry Mining Character No. 10595 approval, the association immediately sought the opinions of its members. The Ministry of Industry's approval and the association's request for member opinions are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Ministry of Industry Approval <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>All submitted items have been noted. Previously, the association submitted a request for strict banning of small mines. An order was issued to the responsible authorities in each province and city to handle applications for small mines carefully and not to issue licenses indiscriminately. The existing small mines that had obtained mining rights should also be supervised and guided at any time. Subsequently, the responsible authorities in each province and city submitted reports one after another, stating that they had earnestly followed the previous order. Even Shanxi, which has the most small mines, has established restrictions on small mines along railway lines and has obtained approval for implementation. It can be seen that the Ministry's banning of small mines has been actively carried out, and each province is gradually achieving visible results. The standard for the approval of small mining rights, according to Article 59 of the Mining Law, requires that the small mine be located in an area with inconvenient transportation, or with very small mineral resources, or in an undeveloped mining area, before mining rights can be established. Therefore, within the established mining areas of large coal mines in various provinces, such as near Zhongxing, Liuhegou, Cixian, Lincheng, Jiawang, Zou Le, Zhongyuan, as well as Kailuan, Luda, and other mining areas, the Ministry has not approved the establishment of small mining rights by the people, always aiming to maintain the main purpose of large mines, in order to protect mining interests. Those who are mining small mines near large mines without submitting for approval should be regarded as private mining behavior, and most are inherited earth kilns. The large mine itself can report to the responsible authorities in each province according to law, and the Ministry has been very strict in handling cases of private mining recently, repeatedly ordering the responsible authorities in each province and city to investigate strictly, prohibit according to law, and take careful measures. It has now been reported that a request to strictly formulate measures to ban small mines has been received by the Ministry. The Ministry is now studying how to formulate these banning measures carefully. If each company of the association has detailed opinions, they should be immediately submitted to the Ministry for reference. This approval is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Request for Opinions <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The association's letter to each member states, "Regarding the case of strictly banning small mines using indigenous methods, the China Po Le Coal Mining Company and the United Office of the China Fu Companies proposed one after another, and the association reported to the Ministry of Industry for approval, which has been separately ordered to the responsible authorities for supervision and guidance and notified to each. Subsequently, the Po Le Coal Mining Company sent a letter, requesting to submit to the Ministry again, to promptly and clearly define measures to prohibit small mines using indigenous methods. After reporting the circumstances earnestly again, we received the Ministry of Industry Mining Character No. 10595, briefly stating, 'The Ministry is currently studying how to formulate these banning measures carefully. Each company of the association should immediately submit to the Ministry for reference.' Therefore, in addition to sending a separate letter, the original submission and ministry approval are copied and sent together, hoping you will check and comply. If there are any opinions to be stated, please promptly prepare them in detail and send them to the association for collection and submission."</p>

<p>Director Wu Xingya of the Seventh Labor Movement Training Institute reported, "Today is the opening ceremony of the Labor Movement Training Institute organized by the Municipal Party Headquarters. It is an honor to have representatives from various labor unions participating in the ceremony. Since the January 28th Incident, the labor movement has made considerable progress and foundation on the whole. In terms of passive work, the communists who used to parasitize on community groups and engage in destructive work have been completely purged, which should be attributed to the efforts of those who lead the labor movement. The labor movement policy is not limited to passive work, but should also engage in active work. First, train cadres and go deep into the ranks of workers, leading the workers with the spirit of hard work, sacrifice, and struggle to achieve labor-capital coordination, communicate the emotions of the workers, promote the workers' production technology, believe in our party, and obey the leader. Looking at the domestic rural industry and commerce, all are showing signs of depression. In the international capitalist arena, the emerging industries are fragile and cannot resist. If we do not seek relief immediately, and are instead anesthetized by reactionary emotional language, it will only hasten our demise. It is hoped that all students will serve in the ranks of workers after graduation and must be loyal to our party, loyal to the country, and loyal to the leader, to complete the work of the revolution. This is the purpose of the Municipal Party Headquarters in organizing this institute."</p>
<h3 id="e194">Representative Speeches <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Supervisor of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech saying, "The purpose of the Municipal Party Headquarters in preparing to establish a Labor Movement Training Institute is because it feels that there is a shortage of labor movement talents, not enough to allocate, so it hopes to create cadre talents to strengthen the force and to engage in the development of national capital in accordance with our party's labor policy." Subsequently, Tao Baichuan, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, spoke, saying, "The labor movement advocated by our party is to protect workers on the one hand and develop production on the other, standing on the position of developing production to protect the interests of workers, and standing on the position of protecting the interests of workers to develop production. Both are equally important. If we only focus on developing production and abandon the interests of workers, it is the proposition of international capitalism. If we only care about the interests of workers and do not strive to develop production, it is the proposition of the Communist Party. I hope that all students will do biological work entirely after graduation in the future, and at the same time, everyone should not forget the labor movement." Finally, Lu Jingshi gave a speech, and the music was played to complete the ceremony. Photos were taken, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>To Avoid Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Lawyer Tang Deheng, with the courtesy name Gonglian, is a native of Yixing, Jiangsu. He joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in August of the 23rd year of the Republic and organized a law firm at Room 72, No. 416 Sichuan Road, practicing law in Shanghai. This time, while handling a case, he used the name Tang Gonglian, resulting in Lawyer Cao Lin finding no lawyer named Tang Gonglian and sending a letter to the Lawyers Association, accusing Tang of impersonating a lawyer and requesting a review. The association proposed a discussion at the 188th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, resolving to send a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting the Industry Bureau Police Department to investigate. Before this letter was sent, the matter had already been clarified: Tang Deheng is Tang Gonglian. The misunderstanding was due to the mistaken use of the courtesy name. The association now intends to notify all members that in the future, when handling cases or representing parties in newspapers, they must use their real name (i.e., the name on the lawyer's certificate from the Ministry of Justice) and never use their courtesy name again, to avoid similar incidents and misunderstandings.</p>

There is also no shortage of talent in statistics, accounting, art, writing, Chinese and English typing, and male and female teachers in various subjects for primary and secondary schools. If industrial, commercial, administrative organizations, and large and small schools need various talents, they can contact the institute at No. 80 Hualong Road, and they will definitely be able to quickly obtain suitable talent that is satisfactory.

<p>Number of Refugees Increases to 25,000</p>
<p>Factory Unable to Accommodate, Gate Crushed</p>
<p>The Organization Has Decided to Resume on February 10th</p>
<p>Rice Tickets Will Be Issued Appropriately During the Closure</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Group started operating the second porridge kitchen on Liuying Road at 6:00 AM on January 1st. Subsequently, due to the sudden increase in the number of poor people drinking porridge, the kitchen was unable to accommodate them, and it was forced to announce a temporary closure starting on January 5th. Then, more than 20 reed sheds were added to the east of the factory, and stoves were added. On the morning of January 13th, it reopened. The situation was recorded in previous reports. Now, the porridge kitchen has only been reopened for two weeks. Unexpectedly, starting on the morning of the day before yesterday (26th), it suddenly announced another closure. The situation is described below:</p>
<h3 id="e200">Refugees Crush the Factory Gate <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Since the porridge kitchen added reed sheds to the east end of the factory and added stoves, reopening on the 13th of this month, the number of poor people drinking porridge has continuously increased to 18,000 to 19,000. The group then increased the porridge to 40 shi, which was just enough to meet the demand. Unexpectedly, the number of refugees has increased more and more in recent days. As of the morning of the 25th, it has increased to more than 25,000. The factory is again unable to accommodate them, and the refugees, driven by hunger, still forced their way in. The factory gate was crushed. At that time, the situation was extremely chaotic.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Fortunately, No Food Scramble Occurred <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, the group had prepared in advance, increasing the rice for the porridge to 55 shi, and cooking 86 vats of porridge. Therefore, the porridge was distributed according to the list, which was enough to meet the demand, and a food scramble was avoided. After the refugees dispersed, the group felt deeply that the situation was dangerous, and the number of people was still likely to increase, which was worrying. Therefore, starting on the morning of the 26th, it re-announced the closure and posted a notice outside the factory. It was heard that many refugees still went to the porridge kitchen the previous morning hoping to get porridge.</p>

His treatment method mainly uses pungent and cool antipyretics, with repeated remarkable effects. For example, a Wang family member in Ximenli with diphtheria and cold fever was cured after three doses. A Qi family child on Datong Road in Zhabei had a fever that was already receding into the body, but two doses allowed it to break out and be safe. He also advises people to take white radishes regularly to clear the lungs and prevent infection, which is also very effective.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Remote Place, Light Official, Arriving with Strong Opinions; Grand Hall, Lavish Banquet, Outside There are Pitiful Creatures</p>
<p>I took people to examine the body, but the garrison soldiers on the city gate actually wouldn't let me go. I jumped up and down, saying: I am the magistrate of this county, a person died right outside my door, I'm just taking a look myself, it's my own business, is it any of your concern? Unless you beat me to death, I won't leave. The soldiers had no choice but to let me through. I saw several rope marks on the dead man's neck, he was obviously strangled to death. I searched the dead man's body and found two letters, proving that he was a traveler from elsewhere. Since he was a traveler from elsewhere, he must have stayed at an inn in this county. So I gathered all the innkeepers in the county and asked if the dead man was a guest at their establishment. The truth finally came out, the innkeeper only said that he had left the inn while ill, not daring to reveal the fact that the army had strangled him. Later, I threatened to beat the innkeeper to death, and he finally told the truth. I couldn't hold back my anger and went to find the commander. He was lying in bed smoking opium, and said with a smile: Magistrate Zhou, you are meddling too much. What does it matter if a few ordinary people die? The important matter of military pay, I have asked for repeatedly, but you never provide it. A person died outside the city, a trivial matter, even if you didn't care, no one would ask you, what does it have to do with you? What does it have to do with me? Yet you come to see me. Gentlemen, do you think these are the words a human would say? Yet he was just a minor commander. I still haven't been able to get over this, I just feel sorry for the dead man. Secondly, it's about them wanting money. Originally, the provincial government had made very thorough preparations, sending a financial commissioner to that area, with all the finances of several counties being centrally collected and distributed, and pay being issued by the financial commissioner, not involving the county magistrate. But those soldiers couldn't wait from one month to the next, and would demand money from the financial commissioner before the due date. The financial commissioner couldn't conjure up money either, so he came to find the county magistrate. This time, the commissioner brought a company commander and twenty or thirty soldiers, suddenly descending upon the county office, demanding that I hand over twenty thousand dollars within three days. According to the old custom, when a county magistrate encountered such a disaster, he would gather all the village chiefs from the county, and have them tied up and beaten one by one. (123)</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Silently, without a sense of joy, without a sense of grief, it is an emotional void.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to the martyrs of the January 28th Incident with a bouquet of plain-colored daffodils, a cup of light-flavored clear wine, and a sincere heart. I do not feign sorrow, nor do I shed a single tear of the weak. Calmly, calmly let the hot blood flow calmly within my skin. I am not afraid of the piercing cold of the wilderness, nor the knife-like north wind. I just clench my two firm fists, and quietly lower my head.</p>
<p>Yellow tomb soil, withered vines, ah, martyrs; the flower of national glory irrigated by your blood will never wither. I can still vaguely remember, it was a dream, who were those people? Covered in blood, they dragged their blood-stained swords in battle, singing, that voice... without sorrow, without regret, the brave melody moved me. They waved to me and said: Come over, we are all pioneers of the nation! Never having known each other in life, we can naturally meet after death. Then I woke up. Ghost, I feel the blood all over my body becoming even hotter.</p>
<p>Martyrs! You have all died before us, you shouted under the bombs raining from the sky, you charged in the forest-like ranks of Type 38 rifles, for the sake of the Chinese nation, not hesitating to use your chests to resist the enemy's bayonets, blood, flowing, flowing in Zhuyuantun, flowing in Miaohang, flowing in Jiangwan,... As for the enemy, the heads of those enemies have also rolled under the knives of our brave warriors. Hehe! Heroes of the nation. Your resistance this time has made all the imperialists show some restraint. The fish and meat in their eyes have turned into a piece of steel.</p>
<p>Martyrs! I no longer want to say more about your great achievements before your spirits. I should not grieve for your deaths for the glory of the nation, and at the same time, I should not excessively praise your merits, because this is all fulfilling the greatest duty for the nation. It is the responsibility that all of us who die later should fulfill.</p>
<p>I put the daffodils on the tombstone, I moisten the tomb with light wine, I hope that the warm season will arrive early, and that green grass sprouts and blood-colored wildflowers re-emerge on the martyrs' tombs. Clenching two firm fists, silently looking up at the sky, the sky is blue, the sun is white, an emotional void.</p>

<p>The ancients said, "In the fourth month in the countryside, there are few idle people." I say, "In the city at the end of the year, everyone is busy." Don't you see? In recent days, the pedestrians in the market, those buying New Year's goods, those delivering New Year's gifts, and those finishing up all the affairs of the New Year, are bustling and hustling, much more than usual, and the goods sold in the stores are cheaper and cheaper, with extra gifts added. They are all making a final struggle in the fleeting end of the year, a momentary shout!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Shanghai is a Big Dye Vat <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>I have a younger cousin whose family circumstances aren't very good, so after he graduated from junior high school, we scrambled around to send him to Shanghai, where he was admitted to the high school affiliated with a certain university.</p>
<p>When my cousin first came to Shanghai, he had a "Tokyo head," a hairstyle that had been popular in Shanghai a dozen years ago. He wore a free-cloth long gown and white cotton socks with black cloth-soled shoes.</p>
<p>After being in Shanghai for only a month, he let his hair grow longer. Then, he started wearing his Zhongshan suit-style school uniform as everyday clothes, and stuffed his free-cloth long gown into the bottom of a trunk. At the same time, he replaced his white cotton socks with patterned ones, and his black cloth-soled shoes with basketball shoes.</p>
<p>After one semester, his hair was combed back and he was applying snow cream to his face. He wore a serge long gown and Western-style trousers. He only wore basketball shoes at school, and leather shoes when he went out.</p>
<p>Starting from the third semester, he began to wear Western suits bought and altered on Wusong Road. White shirts, patterned ties, neatly combed hair, a fair face—you couldn't tell he was a young man from the countryside; he actually looked like a city person.</p>
<p>At the same time, he started going to cafes, movie theaters, and sometimes even slipped into dance halls. On the other hand, he even started flirting with girls.</p>
<p>After muddling through another semester, my cousin suddenly dropped out of school. At first, I thought it was because of financial problems. One day, my uncle came to Shanghai and talked about it, and I learned that the reason for dropping out was partly due to the financial burden, but mostly because my cousin had a girlfriend in Shanghai and wanted to break off his engagement with his fiancée.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sigh and say, "Shanghai is a big dye vat!"</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Regarding the elimination of superstition, Guangxu and I shared the same view, but to avoid any unexpected unfortunate events, I was unwilling to express it too openly, so I had to respond with a diplomatic, rounded tone. "Apart from this, I really can't express anything else! I wonder what Your Majesty thinks?" "These are ridiculous superstitious tales!" Guangxu was unwilling to be subtle at all. Because he knew that among all the people he saw in the palace, whether high or low, almost everyone would secretly report his words and actions to the Empress Dowager; even Empress Longyu was unreliable. There was only one exception, and that was me. So he dared to speak frankly to me. "Last year, there was another matter that perhaps you didn't know about. That is, on the day of the ancestral temple sacrifice, I seemed to hear some relatively interesting news, and I couldn't help but feel more excited than usual. So at the end of the sacrificial ceremony, I deliberately stood in front of the incense table, straightened my body, raised my right hand, gave a salute commonly used by foreigners, and said at the same time, 'Ancestors, please look at the foreigner's salute. Is it good or not?' This was originally just to amuse myself, and there was no disrespect to the ancestors. If they really had spirits, they certainly wouldn't be offended. But several eunuchs standing near me heard it early on. It wouldn't have mattered if only they had heard it; it just so happened that there was such a coincidental thing in the world, on that very night, probably because the incense and candles burned during the day had not been completely extinguished, they actually rekindled and spread, and by the time the guards discovered it, one corner of the ancestral temple was already on fire. Fortunately, there were many people and they desperately poured water to extinguish it, only then was this important building preserved. As a result, those eunuchs who were most superstitious began to discuss it." (233)</p>

<h3 id="e226">A Trip to Cuiwei Peak <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xuxin</p>
<p>Since the recovery of Ningdu, I have been stationed with the army in the city for more than a month. The remote small town has no places for leisure, and I am extremely bored. A local said: About eight miles northwest of the city, there is Cuiwei Peak, which is quite famous in the history of bandit suppression. Why not take a trip there? However, the mountain is steep and not easy to climb. In recent days, Shanghai newspapers have also carried special dispatches for several days, reporting that Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi and others have visited Cuiwei Peak by car on a certain day. Seeing that the authorities and gentlemen have patronized it, then perhaps the place is indeed worth a visit? So, three days after New Year's Day, I asked a guide and, together with colleagues Mr. Huang Mutao, Mr. Zhang Ying, and young Mr. Zhang Gongren, walked out of the north gate and followed the motor road. This road was recently built and can lead directly to the foot of the mountain. At the end of the road, a wooden archway is erected, with the words "Cuiwei Peak" written on it, a newly constructed structure. Upon entering, the mountain shape unfolds like two hands, embracing an open space in the middle. Observing its atmosphere, it is already extraordinary. Inside, there are several acres of fields, and next to the fields there is a stream, its sound gurgling. Walking only a few dozen steps, a large rock face rises abruptly, strange and majestic, like a giant mansion, like a pillar of heaven, standing in the way, with a myriad of forms. Turning to the west, the mountain road becomes higher and higher. Along the way, there are several cliffs, one east and one west, with only enough space for one person in between. We then stooped and followed the road through the gap, trudging upwards. Having passed the jagged rocks, the road begins to diverge. The guide said: Those who wish to ascend the Crimson Fortress of Cuiwei Peak must go to the right; those who wish to go to the Gold Essence Cave of Cuiwei Peak must turn to the left. At this time, we had already reached the mountainside from the foot of the mountain, and we felt breathless and drenched in sweat. So we rested briefly at the crossroads and discussed for a moment. Because climbing the Crimson Fortress is even more difficult than going to the Gold Essence Cave, we decided to seize the opportunity and advance to the more difficult place first. Before long, the so-called Crimson Fortress, the highest point of Cuiwei Peak, was towering in the middle of the sky, standing firmly in front of us. Viewed from the front, it is a huge rock, dark and strangely beautiful, how can it be just a thousand cliffs! Ding Shi said, "The peak marks outside the rainbow, the ridge is placed among the white clouds, the tilted wall suddenly stands upright, the absolute peak is isolated and round," which can be imitated. We thought that if we had already climbed this peak but did not reach its peak and returned in disappointment, it would be too lacking in courage, so we all climbed up the rocks. With our chests against one wall and our hands supporting another, imitating the ascent of apes, we zigzagged in the rock crevices, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, pausing every five steps and panting every ten steps. Thus, we were careful, as if climbing a dangerous plank road, as if climbing a ladder to heaven, for half an hour. Suddenly, we felt a cool breeze and a refreshing atmosphere. Crossing a "Heavenly Gate," we had reached its summit. So we were very happy and lingered on its top. It is about a hundred steps long and half as wide. In the middle stands a flagpole, and the national flag flutters in the sky. There is nothing else except a few places of rotten grass and dilapidated walls, abandoned in the wilderness. The guide said: In December of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, during the Ningdu 26th Route Army mutiny, wealthy households in the city and countryside, avoiding the scourge of the Red bandits, mostly built huts here. The rotten grass and dilapidated walls are the temporary dormitories of the past. The guide then pointed to the peak on the right and said, "Yellow Bamboo Fortress," and on the left, "Guanyin Fortress," forming five fortresses in total. The terrain is all naturally dangerous. The local militia in the fortresses do not need to fire their guns when encountering bandits. They only need to throw large stones down, and they can annihilate many bandits. Therefore, although the Red bandits tried their best to besiege, they could not break through in one or two years. However, although each fortress stored extremely abundant grain, the wealthy people loved gold, and it was better to hide gold. Gold, silver, and jewels could not satisfy hunger. After one or two years of support, the grain was exhausted, and the people ate tree bark and grass leaves, but Ningdu had not yet been recovered. Of the people in the fortresses, except for several hundred who broke out and escaped, it is unknown how many starved to death. In June of the twenty-first year, after Guanyin Fortress and the other small fortresses were breached, the mutual supporting momentum was lost, but only this Crimson Fortress had not yet been breached. In December, the bandits used a false plan to deceive the wealthy households in the Crimson Fortress to go down the mountain, and then they tied them up one by one and killed more than two hundred, a tragic event! In those years, the Central Army also once sent planes to carry flour and salt to provide relief, but the throws were not accurate and were seized by the bandits, which was truly a pity! We sat and talked for a long time, and then climbed down again, turned back to the crossroads, passed the side of a bunker, and went to the Gold Essence Cave. The cave is behind the Crimson Fortress, lower than that fortress. In front of it is a pond, and most of the drinking water for the fortresses is supplied from this. The cave is composed of natural large rocks. Next to the cave are carved four large characters, "Gold Essence Victory." There is also the Little Spiritual Official Temple. Upon entering the cave, it is suddenly spacious and bright, mountain flowers blooming, and tree birds chirping. The rock surrounds three sides, especially the rock extending out to the right, half-covering the sky, leaning forward and downward, about dozens of steps long. Stalactites hang upside down, like layers and shavings, like screens, extremely magnificent and strangely beautiful. The guide said: This was the granary of those who avoided the bandits in the past. At this time, the sun was already setting in the west, and people were also slightly tired, so we returned with our interest exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Zhejiang Provincial Government Allocates One Million in Land Bonds <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>To Supplement the Educational Reserve Fund</p>
<p>According to the report submitted by the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, the case of allocating one million yuan in local public bonds from the province to supplement the educational reserve fund was previously resolved and passed by the provincial government meeting. The original charter of the reserve fund was also reviewed by the Legal Regulations Review Committee and reported to the 734th meeting for review and passage.

<h3 id="e236">Saint Francis Xavier's College Plans to Build a New School <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Saint Francis Xavier's College, located on Nansun Road in Hongkou, has been run by French clergy for 60 years. Upon investigating the internal organization of the school, it was found that it has a Chinese department and a Western department. In recent years, considering the increasing number of Chinese students applying to the school, the school staff had already resolved to build a new school for the Chinese department. As early as 1913, they had started planning to separate the Chinese and Western departments and establish separate schools. However, due to the impact of the war, the plan was shelved. Nevertheless, the number of applicants increased daily, and every year, hundreds of new applicants were turned away due to limited enrollment. Therefore, the school staff deeply regretted this. In 1922, despite the poor economic conditions, they launched the first fundraising campaign, raising 18,775 taels of silver. The following year, the students at the school continued the fundraising efforts, raising another 31,581 yuan. Later, alumnus Cheng Yize generously donated 10,000 taels of silver. At the same time, graduates from 1914 initiated the organization of a branch school to accommodate the new applicants from previous years, increase revenue, and expedite the realization of the new school in the shortest possible time. Thus, this branch school was established in February 1923. Initially, it only rented old-fashioned buildings on Seward Road in the city for two and a half years before moving to the current Western-style building on Rue Tenant de la Tour. This location can accommodate 350 students, hence the current enrollment of over 750 students. As for the funds raised earlier, they were used to purchase a 37-mu plot of land at the end of Tangshan Road (currently the school's temporary sports field) for over 100,000 taels of silver. The shortfall was covered by the school's operational funds. At that time, the area was mostly residential, so it was decided in 1927 to start construction. However, the construction was halted due to the Northern Expedition. Now, the surrounding area has transformed from a residential area into a factory area, which is not suitable for establishing a school. Therefore, the latest plan is to sell the land first and purchase a new, more suitable location. Thus, they are launching another fundraising campaign during this 60th-anniversary celebration, hoping that the new school can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Zhaohe Middle School in this city was originally established to commemorate the Zhaohe warship uprising in 1915. After the vice chairmen of the board, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Yu Qiaqing, and other members painfully managed the school, they got vigorous support from leaders from all walks of life in society, such as Wu Xingya, Du Yong, Huang Jinrong, and Chen Qun. Since its establishment, the school has already achieved a certain scale. Now, the board of directors of the school, in order to seek the school's own development, held a meeting to discuss and unanimously agreed that the initiator and vice chairman of the board, Mr. Yang Hu, has a glorious history in the Zhaohe uprising. It is appropriate for him to preside over the school. Mr. Yang also believes that education is one of the social undertakings and cannot refuse the role, so he immediately agreed to go to the school to take charge. The transfer of authority between the old and new principals was completed yesterday. It is heard that Mr. Yang has formulated a meticulous plan for improvement in order to seek development.

<p>Furen Defeats Donghua</p>
<p>Result 53 to 39</p>
<p>! Tomorrow Night Battle with McLings!</p>
<p>The Furen University basketball team played against the Shanghai powerhouse Donghua team last night at Shen Garden. This was the third match of the team's visit to Shanghai. More than 500 spectators attended, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. After a two-day rest, the athletes from the north have recovered their original condition. Their offense was energetic and colorful. The powerful Donghua team was helpless and struggled to resist. They lost 39 to 53. They are worthy of being the elite troops who were once invincible in the north. (Tomorrow night's battle with McLings)</p>
<h3 id="e242">Donghua Wins by a Narrow Margin <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>When the two armies engaged, they shuttled back and forth several times. Sun Baoqing detoured straight in and scored two points. Li Baoshan returned the favor, and Lu Zhongen scored a point for taking the lead. Liu Xueqi immediately showed great courage, supporting the moon with clouds, and ascended to the top with three arrows from Tianshan in one leap. Feng and Qian's two generals were resourceful on both sides, creating a 6-6 tie. The two Lis from the north did not lag behind and took the lead again. Chen Xianglong hit three consecutive shots, leading with 16 to 10. This was Donghua's golden age.</p>
<p>The Northern Army led the way before and after. Although Furen was in a bad environment, the entire army calmly responded. Li, the forward, broke the silence, and Liu and Zhao successively made contributions, chasing to 16 to 18, only one point behind. The new force, Wu Bixian, immediately came to support, and Li Baoshan was replaced, greatly boosting the military situation. The score gradually approached and reached a 20-20 tie for the third time. At this time, the battle became more intense. After Sun Baoqing's long shot was ineffective, Wu Bixian and Li Yunzhong took the opportunity to scout the camp and ended the first half with 24 to 20.</p>
<p>Do Whatever You Want, Lemon is Ten Points, the war restarted, Donghua made great efforts to turn defeat into victory. But the generals of Furen were all powerful. Donghua used left and right corner attacks, and they were able to turn the tables and make use of the situation, and moved forward from the middle road. Donghua was cut off by them for a while, and Zhao, Li and others were able to do whatever they wanted. In a short time, they occupied the highest peak with 39 to 29.</p>
<p>Getting Worse and Worse, Donghua suffered from this pressure and frequently wanted to come up with unexpected ways to win, but the opponent's defense was tight and they were unable to succeed many times, forming a stalemate for a while. After Jia transferred Qian, the situation became even worse. Furen became more and more colorful. In the last three minutes, Feng Nianhua had a good performance and won back two goals. It was a pity that the time was no longer with them, and they were defeated by the Furen team with 53 to 39.</p>

<p>Donghua Youyou Draws Again</p>
<p>Result 2-2</p>
<p>In the Western Union Football Association's Chinese Character Forest Cup, the Donghua Youyou two B teams drew 3-3 last Saturday. The strengths of the two teams were not determined. Therefore, the two teams re-decided the outcome at Shen Garden Stadium at 3 pm yesterday. As a result, the two teams drew again with a tie of 2-2. There were only about 200 spectators. The details of the competition are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Guangzhong Makes the First Contribution</p>
<p>The Donghua team kicked off the attack first. Before they had gone a few steps, they were intercepted by Youyou's Huang Weihua. He fought bravely, faced the enemy alone, and retreated with one kick, so that the territory was safe. After Donghua's crisis was resolved, the morale of the entire army suddenly increased. There were stormy waves in front of the Youyou gate. After about a quarter of an hour, Xue Wenxiu received assistance from the front, galloped along the side, and picked towards the center. The ball landed about ten yards in front of the goal, which could be kicked in. Unexpectedly, Yang Renwei panicked and was too hasty, kicking the ball out of bounds, and the good opportunity was lost. Youyou's goalkeeper kicked the ball out, and it was intercepted by Fu Zhibin before he could kick it far, and passed it to Zhou Guangzhong. Zhou was about to shoot hard. Youyou Xu Wenkui's eagerness to save the ball was penalized for a free kick, which was kicked by Zhou Guangzhong. He raised his foot, and the ball went into the goal after rubbing the goal post. The record was opened. Afterwards, both sides had many opportunities, but they all missed them. The first half ended in a melee, with Donghua leading 1-0.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Xu Wenkui Hits Two Goals in a Row <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the sides changed and fought again. One side took advantage of the victory to pursue, while the other side was determined to retaliate. The competition between the two sides became more intense. Youyou's team had good ball handling skills, and Xu Wenkui was extremely heroic. He rushed into the forbidden area with the ball, and when he reached an appropriate position, he raised his foot to shoot. The goalkeeper Fan Jiaju caught the ball and kicked it out. Shi Jinsheng caught a glimpse of a ball flying over, so he intercepted the ball at lightning speed and sent it far to Youcheng. Youcheng hovered slightly, and the goalkeeper Fan Jiaju ran out to stop him. Youcheng gently passed the ball to Xu Wenkui, and Xu shot immediately without stopping, hitting the empty goal, making the score 1-1. Youyou's momentum was greatly enhanced, and the five forwards fought bravely and showed their talents. Xu and Xi's two generals cooperated and advanced, using high balls to pass over the two lines of defense. Donghua's right defender Zheng Zhiyun accidentally touched the ball, and the referee was impartial and penalized a 12-yard penalty. Xu Wenkui used the penalty as an axe and kicked it successfully, making the score 1-2. Youyou took the lead.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Guangzhong's Foot Creates a Draw <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>After Donghua lost a goal, everyone became brave and extraordinary. Fu Zhibin repeatedly led the army deep into the enemy's territory, and the Youyou gate was constantly in turmoil and in danger of being lost. Only relying on the tight defense of the inner guards, there was no gap to take advantage of. In the last ten minutes, Donghua Ding Zhaocheng passed a ball from afar, and Fu Zhibin headed the ball to Zhou Guangzhong, who was waiting to make a sure shot. With a violent kick, the ball shot out like an arrow from a bow. Goalkeeper Li Zhi was also helpless. Before long, the time was up. Donghua and Youyou each scored two goals, drawing again.</p>

<p>The fight between the Eagles and Jiangwan followed the Jian You battle. Chen Zongqi and Zhang Jingxiang did not play, causing Jiangwan's defense to be empty. The Eagles were able to soar freely, and the score led all the way. At the end of the first half, the Eagles were 19 and Jiangwan was 16. When the defense was changed and the battle was resumed, Jiangwan's military appearance was relatively neat and had chased to 26 and 32 to tie the game twice, and Zhou Dayun took the lead with a goal. However, in an instant, Liang Guoquan made a close shot and a long shot, creating a better future. Before long, they tied again for the second time. The intensity of the battle at this time was refreshing, and the number of wins and losses, such as being in a fog of five miles, was entirely judged by the arrival of luck.

Professional players from the United States, Germany, England, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, India, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Canada, and Ireland have registered to participate. It is expected that this championship will compete fiercely with the Davis Cup.</p>

<p>— Lecture by Yu Yunxiu, Recorded by Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>Since this publication began soliciting reports on medical and health conditions from various regions, the submitted articles often describe the situation as being in its rudimentary stages or just beginning to sprout. This is deeply regrettable! In the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic, our school held a Mandarin speech contest on the topic of "How to Popularize Scientific Medicine in China." We were fortunate to have Mr. Yu Yunxiu as the judge, who summarized the arguments of the various speakers and provided a final evaluation that was highly relevant and timely. This article is based on Mr. Yu's comments, which are not only insightful and incisive but also enlightening! In particular, his enumeration of the reasons for the underdevelopment of medicine and health in our country, his analysis of the root causes, and his exposure of the problems can be described as hitting the nail on the head and providing a vivid depiction! Therefore, we are publishing it in this journal to serve as a guide for those responsible for improving Chinese medicine and health. Reporter's note from Southeast Medical College, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The topic of your speeches today is: "How to Popularize Scientific Medicine in China." Most of your speeches take the view that popular education is a prerequisite for popularizing scientific medicine. I believe that simply starting with popular education is not useful. Consider the current elementary and secondary school teachers, university professors, and important figures in the government and the party. When they get sick, don't they still ask traditional doctors to treat them? Can it be said that their rationality is insufficient? Based on this fact, I believe that popular education is the backing for popularizing scientific medicine in China, not a prerequisite. The fundamental problem is that people with knowledge lack the ability to distinguish right from wrong and the will to consistently uphold their beliefs.</p>
<p>One student mentioned that a certain important figure in the Nationalist Government still consults traditional doctors when he is ill. Another mentioned the reform of old and new medicine in Japan, which I think is a good comparison. Since the Meiji Restoration, the development of scientific medicine in Japan has relied entirely on political power. The reason why scientific medicine cannot be popularized in China is that it lacks political power. Politics and medicine are closely linked.</p>
<p>We know that before the Meiji Restoration, traditional Chinese medicine dominated the medical scene in Japan. How was it possible to rapidly transform after the Meiji Restoration, abolish traditional Chinese medicine, and revive scientific medicine, unlike in China, where we are still hesitating and unable to move forward? The biggest reason is that the traditional Chinese medicine community in Japan had already begun to question the theories of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. Scholars such as Goto Konzan, Kagawa Shūkei, and Yoshimasu Tōdō emphasized empiricism and opposed the traditional Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories, considering them to be abstract and useless. Kagawa's book is called "Selection of Medicines," and Yoshimasu's book has been collected and published as "Complete Works of Tōdō." It is truly a groundbreaking work in traditional Chinese medicine. You can refer to it. One part is called "Evidences of Medicines," in which he uses practical observation and description to deduce the effects of medicines, completely ignoring the theories of five colors matching the five internal organs and the five elements matching the five colors – the absurd theory that the spleen corresponds to earth and the kidney corresponds to water. Moreover, he frequently refutes the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories. Goto died in 1733, and Yoshimasu died in 1771, both in the 18th century. At that time, they already had the idea of eliminating empty talk and moving towards practicality, and these two had many disciples. Yoshimasu Tōdō was even more famous and had more disciples. His doctrines spread throughout the country, and people of all levels, including feudal lords and officials, admired his doctrines. Therefore, political figures had a considerable degree of awareness. As a result, after the introduction of Dutch medicine, it was easy to accept it through the use of political power. After the Meiji Restoration, political figures adopted a clear principle, recognized the facts, and saw that Western medicine had a basis for every word and name. They simply used decisive measures to completely abolish traditional Chinese medicine, thus achieving the popularization of scientific medicine and reaching the second position in the world of medicine today. From this point of view, this is all due to the influence of Tōdō's doctrines and the political power that achieved medical reform!</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The case of Dr. Yin Leren of Nantong being accused of medical malpractice has lasted for over half a year. The Nantong District Court initially sentenced the defendant to a fine of 1,000 yuan. Dr. Yin, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. To clarify the truth of the case, the High Court requested an assessment from the Zhenru Institute of Forensic Medicine. The main points of the institute's response were: (1) Whether there were a sufficient number of assistants present during the surgery; (2) It is common for needles to break suddenly during spinal puncture surgery, but whether this is sufficient to cause death depends on the location of the broken needle. If the broken needle is between the vertebrae or outside the spine, there is no reason for it to cause death. If the broken needle is between the vertebrae and inside the spinal cord, it can migrate to other locations. This can only be clarified through autopsy. The above two points are the most reasonable and fair assessment, and the phrase "This can only be clarified through autopsy" is particularly meaningful. Please elaborate on it.</p>
<p>In recent years, medical malpractice lawsuits have become increasingly common. When dealing with such cases, courts occasionally seek assessments from medical institutions in various regions as a reference for their judgments. However, the assessments are ultimately based on the facts described in the documents submitted, without the assessors having personally witnessed the situation. Disease resides within the human body, and doctors treat patients. Unfortunately, if a patient dies, whether this is due to the doctor's negligence cannot be determined solely by the speculation of a third party. To achieve complete clarity and convince both sides, it is necessary to dissect the deceased patient's body and conduct a thorough examination. In the well-publicized Yin case, according to the opinion of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the crux of the matter is whether the broken needle was located between the vertebrae or inside the spinal cord. This conclusion is extremely accurate, but whether it was between the vertebrae or inside the spinal cord is not known to outsiders and cannot be determined by mere words. If the court, based on this statement, declares the defendant innocent, the patient's family may find it difficult to accept. Conversely, if the defendant is found guilty of negligent homicide, Dr. Yin can ask the judge how he knows that the broken needle was inside the spinal cord. All of these are extremely difficult issues to resolve. The only solution is to dissect the deceased's body to seek complete clarity. Once the body is dissected, the location of the broken needle can be easily determined, and previous doubts can be dispelled.</p>
<p>The purpose of litigation is to seek true right and wrong. Therefore, judges should base their judgments on accurate facts. The true evidence in medical cases lies in the deceased's body. Abandoning the patient's body and relying solely on the empty talk of pleadings or oral arguments will not reveal the truth. Therefore, in my opinion, if medical malpractice cases occur in the future, the court should make autopsy of the deceased's body the first priority. If the patient's family refuses the autopsy, the judge should refuse to accept the case. In this way, the court can achieve twice the result with half the effort, and both the plaintiff and defendant can save unnecessary arguments and obtain the true right and wrong. For the patient's family, if they are willing to sacrifice the remains of the deceased, they can vent their anger for a time. Otherwise, it is best to settle the matter peacefully.</p>

<p>(12) Urban Health Perspectives</p>
<p>Urban health in China, such as in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, etc., although they have initial models, seems to have progressed more in Shanghai. In the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association initiated by Shanghai medical celebrities and social figures effectively aroused public awareness. Recently, they established tuberculosis clinics and published anti-tuberculosis publications, showing great effort. Based on the proposed three-year anti-tuberculosis plan, we hope it will be realized.</p>
<p>The importance of leprosy prevention in public health is well known. Over the past year, the Shanghai Leprosy Association has offered rewards for articles, attracting medical students' attention, which is worth noting. Efforts such as those of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association and the establishment of children's dental hospitals by the Home Industries Cooperative can supplement the efforts of health authorities in public health. We hope that more public health associations will flourish in the future.</p>
<p>During the summer, the Shanghai Municipal Health Authorities diligently worked to prevent diseases among citizens, such as administering preventive injections, inspecting drinking water, handling waste, and killing stray dogs. As a result, infectious diseases such as cholera and smallpox were rare in the 23rd year of the Republic! This shows the value of preventive medicine. Not only that, Nanjing, Hankou, Beijing, and other places have also focused on disease prevention without negligence. In the past year, few vicious infectious diseases have spread within China, except for typhoid fever and dysentery. Therefore, all Chinese people should recognize the importance of preventive medicine.</p>
<p>There is another new and groundbreaking initiative: the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the Children's Welfare Association, the Children's Morning Post, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Health Bureau, and other five organizations jointly established a children's health camp at the middle school department of Tongji University in Wusong during the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic, with a semi-official character. Although the time was only six weeks, the results were unexpected. Most of the children who entered the camp were able to fulfill our ideal goals: developing good hygiene habits and improving their physical and mental health. Resting our hopes on the future of the nation with this camp is truly promising.</p>
<p>In the impending crisis of future wars, the authorities are aware of the importance of air defense and have conducted air defense exercises in Shanghai and Nanjing, which seem quite realistic. Major hospitals and the Red Cross in the area have designed simulated rescue plans, and it is expected that major cities will follow suit in the future.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the New Life Movement has gained momentum. The authorities have shown great determination to address the opium problem with a thunderous force, executing opium dealers and arresting opium smokers in various places in Nanjing and other places, mandating the strict prohibition of opium, which has had a significant and positive impact on public health. The strict inspections of public prostitutes and suppression of secret prostitutes in Beijing are also good deeds to improve national health. We sincerely hope that these efforts will continue.</p>
<p>After the recovery of the bandit areas in southern Jiangxi, the Shanghai Local Association commissioned Mr. Pang Jingzhou to take charge of disaster relief. Popular obstetrics hospitals were established in Hebei, Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places to provide free childbirth services to alleviate the suffering of poor mothers and children. In this year, these public health facilities were all things that we heard and were so happy that we could not sleep.</p>
<p>(13) Conclusion</p>
<p>The medical and health situation in our country in the past year has been roughly as described above. Although there may be omissions of certain facts, the general outline has been presented. Concluding this article, our impression is that Chinese medicine and health in the 23rd year of the Republic face: the lurking danger of medical education deviating from its purpose, frequent medical disputes, intense infighting among medical groups, the lingering boundaries of medical schools, traditional doctors still lost in dreams, public health failing to be popularized, the medical publishing industry barren and awaiting cultivation, and the new pharmaceutical industry only in its nascent stages. Therefore, where do we go from here? Please recognize the truth, make the greatest efforts in the 24th year of the Republic, reverse the critical situation, determine the goal, and work together!

<h3 id="e265">Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(52) Tropical Splenomegaly (Commonly Known as Black Fever)</p>
<p>(Q) What is tropical splenomegaly?</p>
<p>(A) It is a chronic feverish infectious disease that is endemic to certain regions, characterized by a very large spleen and liver, as well as anemia, wasting, and edema. It has been spreading rapidly in the Jiangbei area recently.</p>
<p>(Q) Why is it often referred to as black fever in the newspapers?</p>
<p>(A) This name is translated from the English "Black Fever." Because Westerners commonly call this disease "Black Fever." At the same time, they also call another infectious disease with a different cause, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, "Black Fever." Therefore, this name is fundamentally a mistaken common name from abroad (not everything from abroad is necessarily correct), and we do not need to imitate it.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the correct Western name for this tropical splenomegaly, and are there any other names?</p>
<p>(A) In Latin, it is Splenomegalia Tropica. In German, it is Tropische Splenomegalie. In English, it is Tropical Splenomegaly. There is also another name called "Kala Azar."</p>
<p>(Q) What is the pathogen of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) It is a type of flagellate, named Leishmania Donovani in honor of its discoverers, Leishman and Donovan.</p>
<p>(Q) Where does this pathogen parasitize in the patient's body?</p>
<p>(A) It parasitizes in the internal organs, especially in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. It primarily parasitizes in endothelial cells.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a relationship between the age of the patient and tropical splenomegaly?</p>
<p>(A) Most patients with this disease are young people.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the pathogen spread?</p>
<p>(A) As far as we know, the pathogen of this disease is transmitted from dogs to humans by the bites of several types of mosquitoes called Phlebotomus argentipes and Anopheles punctipennis, and a type of bedbug called Cimes hemipterus. There are often cases where multiple members of a family are infected.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of tropical splenomegaly?</p>
<p>(A) At the onset of the disease, there are several weeks of continuous fever, and this type of fever often has large daily fluctuations (this is the first stage). In addition, it is accompanied by symptoms similar to dysentery, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and severe anemia. After two or three weeks of such fever and various symptoms, they disappear, but the enlargement of the spleen and liver continues, and the anemia gradually worsens.</p>
<p>(Q) Does this fever and remission repeat endlessly?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. The non-feverish periods of repeated fever and remission gradually shorten. After several months, the spleen gradually enlarges to a very large extent, extending into the lesser pelvis (second stage). At this time, the degree of anemia is even greater, and it progresses to the point of causing general cachexia and emaciation.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms in the third stage?</p>
<p>(A) The disease reaches its extreme in the third stage. The abdomen is very distended, and the skin takes on a dull, earthy color, hence the common name "black fever."</p>
<p>(Q) How long does the entire course of black fever take, and what is the outcome?</p>
<p>(A) The entire course of this disease takes six months to three years. The outcome is death due to cachexia and other complications (such as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, septicemia, etc.).</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Antimony preparations, such as tartar emetic, Neostibosan, or Neostam, are now used for intravenous injection, which is quite effective. Inject 0.1 grams per 100 pounds of body weight, made into a 4% solution, every other day. The total injection amount is approximately 3 grams.</p>

<p>(33) Scarlet Fever (Continued)</p>
<p>Because the rash resembles a sheet of red, the disease is also known as "Dan Sha". The rash usually first appears below the collarbone and on the neck, gradually (in about 24 hours) spreading to the face (less so), head, torso, and limbs. However, the area around the mouth and nose remains pale and does not develop a rash. This unique characteristic is of significant value in diagnosing scarlet fever. Sometimes, the rash can appear in different forms, leading to names such as papular, miliary, vesicular, pemphigoid, mottled, and hemorrhagic scarlet fever, based on its specific appearance. Hemorrhagic scarlet fever is usually severe and can be life-threatening. Fortunately, these atypical forms of scarlet fever are not very common in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Symptoms of the Throat in Scarlet Fever | The mucous membrane of the throat and tonsils become significantly red and swollen, known as scarlet fever tonsillitis. If the inflammation worsens, the soft palate and uvula also swell. At the same time, gray-white, greenish, or brownish coatings appear on the tonsils. The patient's suffering intensifies, and swallowing becomes increasingly difficult. These symptoms closely resemble pharyngeal diphtheria.</p>
<p>Changes in the Tongue Coating in this Disease | Are also quite distinctive and worth noting. Initially, there is a grayish-white or white coating on the tongue, but it soon gradually peels off, and the surface of the tongue becomes clean and bright red. The fungiform papillae also swell, making the tongue surface uneven and resembling the surface of a cat's tongue, hence the term "cat tongue." However, the "cat tongue" is rarely found in recent epidemics of scarlet fever.</p>
<p>Desquamation of Scarlet Fever | From the third or fourth day after the rash appears, the rash gradually fades. The areas where the rash appeared first also fade first. After about a week, the skin returns to its normal color, and the body temperature gradually decreases to normal. At this time, desquamation usually begins, following the same pattern as the rash, starting from the neck and gradually spreading to the torso and limbs. The desquamation can be like bran or in membrane-like sheets, hence the clinical terms "pityriasiform desquamation" and "membranous desquamation." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>| Treatment for Type C Pyorrhea Alveolaris |</p>
<p>This type of pyorrhea is caused by systemic diseases. Therefore, the primary treatment strategy is to eliminate the underlying cause. In this case, dentists must collaborate with general physicians to achieve effective results. The treatment is divided into systemic and local approaches. Local treatments, including surgical procedures and medications, are the same as those for Types A and B. Systemic treatment should be handled by general physicians. For pyorrhea caused by diabetes, the oral symptoms are very obvious, making diagnosis easier. However, the initial symptoms may not be apparent, so urine tests are crucial for dental diagnosis.</p>
<p>| Prevention of Pyorrhea Alveolaris |</p>
<p>The main cause of pyorrhea is the accumulation of calculus around the teeth. Therefore, removing calculus and maintaining oral hygiene eliminates the chance of developing the disease. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>(1) Visit a dentist every six months for an oral examination and professional teeth cleaning to completely remove calculus. This also allows for a detailed examination of the oral condition. The cost is minimal, and the benefits are significant.</p>
<p>(2) Brush your teeth regularly, three times a day. Use toothpaste or tooth powder containing antiseptics and astringents. Also, massage the gums with a toothbrush to strengthen and cleanse them. This method is effective in preventing gingivitis and pyorrhea because the medications can directly contact the gums and mucous membranes and penetrate the spaces around the teeth to exert their effects.</p>
<p>(3) If you notice gingivitis, red and swollen gums, soreness, or bleeding, which may indicate the onset of pyorrhea, consult a dentist immediately. At the same time, use the toothpaste mentioned above to brush your teeth and massage your gums to keep the mouth clean and promote early resolution of the inflammation.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to hygiene in daily diet and lifestyle. Avoid excessive indulgence and overwork. Also, get plenty of fresh air, sunlight, and appropriate exercise.</p>
<p>(5) If you discover any systemic diseases, consult a general physician immediately to prevent them from affecting your teeth.</p>
<p>The above five preventative measures are very effective for preventing pyorrhea. Early attention can prevent future problems. This article only covers simple and effective methods. Specialized surgical procedures that are too complex and difficult for the average reader to understand are omitted. (End)</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>What is the real value of X-rays in the diagnosis of this disease? We certainly cannot say that it is definitive for everything, nor can we say that all other examination methods can be eliminated after the application of X-rays. However, in ordinary clinical examinations, X-ray examinations often provide final corrections and supplements. The size, density, and shape of lesions, as described above, are excellent examples, as are the size and shape of cavities. As for lesions far from the surface of the lung, so-called central tuberculosis, physical examinations yield almost no information, even for extensive lesions. However, X-ray examination can completely reveal them, leaving no escape. As for differentiating between different types of the disease—exudative, proliferative, and cirrhotic—this can be difficult even in pathological anatomy! X-ray examination cannot completely take over this task, but the images of cirrhotic lesions are especially clearly defined, and the images of calcified lesions are especially dense. These are completely different from the images of exudative lesions. Regarding early diagnosis, the recognition of early lesions, X-ray examinations do not yield impressive results. If pathological anatomy yields 90%, then X-rays yield only about 10%. This gap is obviously too large, but it is limited by the facts. Readers should understand that the lungs are three-dimensional organs, and X-ray examination produces only a two-dimensional image. Lesions occurring in these many planes are all superimposed on a single plane. We cannot expect to make definitive judgments based solely on the image! In addition, for several model types of the disease, such as hilar and pulmonary vascular tuberculosis, apical tuberculosis, caseous pneumonia, and acute miliary tuberculosis, X-rays often reveal findings that supplement other examinations. However, these are all too specialized, and ordinary people do not need to know them in such detail, so they are all omitted here!</p>
<p>Regarding X-ray examinations, they usually involve both "fluoroscopy" and "photography." Most patients consider these to be redundant and meaningless. In fact, they each have their strengths and weaknesses, and neither should be abandoned. Photography allows for long-term preservation for continuous research, unlike fluoroscopy, which is a fleeting examination that leaves no record. However, fluoroscopy also has its unique advantages. For example, the movement of the diaphragm and ribs during breathing, the expansion and contraction of the lungs, the changes in the apex of the lung during coughing, and the pulsation of the heart and major blood vessels can only be clearly observed with fluoroscopy. Photography cannot achieve this.</p>
<p>The value of X-ray examination in the diagnosis of this disease has been outlined above! In summary, it often provides supplements and corrections to other clinical examinations and is worthy of praise. However, it does not contribute much to differentiating between types of the disease or determining whether lesions are rapidly progressing. This conclusion may disappoint some people. However, even from this point of view, its contribution to the benefit of humanity is beyond the description of this humble pen! (End of Chapter 8)</p>

<h3 id="e270">Three Years Ago Today <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>Three years ago today, in the first half of the day, I was in Wusong. I still remember getting up early in the morning and, as usual, taking a walk along the Huangpu River, looking out at the misty sea in the distance.</p>
<p>I opened a book and read a few lines, but I put it down. No, I was completely unable to concentrate on reading. The sound of the guns of Japanese imperialism on September 18th shattered my interest in reading. In the past, I used to come to the river every morning to read for an hour, but after that, I failed nine times out of ten. Looking at the scenery of the distant sea, I often thought of my hometown in the Northeast and worried about the devastation and pain my hometown was suffering. I was not someone who believed in "studying without forgetting to save the country." In fact, at that time, I neither wanted to save the country nor wanted to study. What bothered me day and night was an unspeakable feeling of depression and indignation!</p>
<p>After lunch, I planned to go for another walk by the river. Just as I was about to leave, Han Zhang ran up to me and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go! Let's go to Shanghai for a meeting! A fellow townsmen's association meeting. Let's go!"</p>
<p>I shook my head, but he dragged me away. As he walked, he muttered:</p>
<p>"You bookworm, the country is in trouble. Why aren't you rising up to save the country! You have to participate!"</p>
<p>Listening to him, it seemed that holding a fellow townsmen's association could save the country. Although I didn't want to save the country, I was very happy to hear that others could save the country and wanted to save the country. Especially we Northeasterners, we should save the country even more.</p>
<p>If holding a fellow townsmen's association could save the country and our homes, then I had to participate no matter what.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we took a free train to Shanghai.</p>
<p>So, in the afternoon of today three years ago, I was in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The fellow townsmen's association meeting at the Zhongshe ended at half past six. The temporary curfew announced by the authorities of the concession blocked the residents' journey back to Wusong. At the same time, I heard others say that the Shanghai-Wusong trains had stopped running for the night, so even if I ran to the North Station, I might not be able to get back. I followed some fellow townsmen to the home of a fellow townsman living on Beler Road to stay overnight.</p>
<p>This fellow townsman lived in a small front room on the second floor. Adding so many people caused a great panic regarding sleeping arrangements. Not only were there not enough beds, but there were also not enough quilts. It was January 28th, still in the winter season, and it was difficult to sleep without a quilt at night. What to do? Everyone was a little anxious.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, the homeowner came up with a solution. He didn't say it out loud. He first ran downstairs to the sub-landlord, and then when he came back up, we all understood. He was holding a box of mahjong tiles in his hand. Everyone laughed, and the problem was solved.</p>
<p>Almost everyone wants to play mahjong when they see it. Even in a national crisis, this pastime cannot be stopped. There were many of us, so we decided to draw lots. I lost, but I did have a place to sleep. I went to sleep at around ten o'clock. I remember telling the four warriors before going to sleep:</p>
<p>"Call me early tomorrow morning. I want to go back to Wusong early."</p>
<p>As I was sleeping, the people playing cards woke me up. I thought it was dawn, but the electric lights were still on. At the same time, I heard the voices of people in the front and back of the house.</p>
<p>"Get up quickly! It's started! The Japanese soldiers must have started fighting!"</p>
<p>After saying this, the person who woke me up left me and ran to the sundeck. Only I was left in the room, accompanied by the messy mahjong on the table.</p>
<p>It was midnight. I put on my clothes and went to the sundeck. A red glow rose to meet me. The sound of gunfire rang out like a string of pearls.</p>
<p>"So this is the start of the fighting."</p>
<p>"Good, this time we can vent our anger. The Japanese are too bullying!"</p>
<p>"That's right!"</p>
<p>"There must be a big fire, otherwise it wouldn't be so red."</p>
<p>"Probably in the Baoshan Road area, near the North Station?"</p>
<p>On the sundeck, in the alleyway, people were talking and staring at the same place in a daze. I thought, this time the war probably wasn't started by China, right? Of course not.</p>
<p>The second September 18th tragedy had begun again in Shanghai. The Japanese soldiers were so barbaric? I thought, this is probably what makes imperialism more civilized than our small and weak nation?</p>
<p>Today, three years later, has arrived again, reminding me of that day three years ago and prompting me to write this short memoir.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Where to Begin? <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>If it weren't excessive, I would have to say a few words on such an important historical day. But where to begin has become the problem. The scope is too broad, and the problem is too serious. If we are not completely indifferent, we will naturally feel endless sadness for the ruined walls and crumbling buildings that are before our eyes, we will naturally feel endless sorrow for the lost territories, and we will naturally feel endless indignation for the traitors who are invading our territories and the enemy cavalry commanding them. Land and rights are finite, but their greed is insatiable. Old disputes are not resolved, and new disputes arise, continuously. Their diplomatic strategies and military actions over the past three years have been aimed at this single goal. Military actions are followed by diplomatic declarations, and diplomatic declarations are followed by military actions. The tree of truth is always planted in the garden of the strong and tyrannical enemy. On this day of great historical significance, we must at least consider this issue, right?</p>
<h3 id="e272">Moonless Moonlit Night <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>Everyone has probably heard of the scenery along the coasts and lakes of Southern Europe, such as Italy, which is mostly so beautiful and clear! But it seems that few have heard of a place in our China that, even at night, when there is no moon, still resembles a moonlit night scattered with beautiful, clear, silvery light.</p>
<p>This is the southwest that you think of whenever you mention the north! That remote border area of Dali, Yunnan, is the place where the world-famous marble is produced. No wonder the scenery and colors are so elegant. But who still worries about these lovely mountains and rivers—Dali!</p>
<p>On one side, it faces the sea, and on the other, it leans against Cangshan Mountain. In the middle of this embrace of sea and mountains is Dali, a hundred li of flat land—even better than the poor land of Sichuan. From beginning to end, it is all the same fields and houses, with the blue sky above, the clear blue sea, and the lush green mountains. The terrain of Dali is like a fish, a hundred li long and ten to twenty li wide. The entrances at the head and tail are where the sea and mountains meet.</p>
<p>Here, thanks to the abundance of natural products and the lack of capitalist economic devastation, the countryside, combined with such quiet and beautiful scenery, still seems to be lying leisurely.</p>
<p>At night, if you climb a high mountain and look out, almost all of Dali can be seen faintly. Within twenty or thirty li, even a tree can be distinguished. Even a shout from twenty li away can be heard clearly. The clarity and invigorating nature of the air and the pure white color of the sky make it look like a moonlit night at the time of the full moon!</p>
<p>The clouds in the sky are scattered gloomily, and the moon has hidden its face. However, from Dali city and the surrounding countryside, you can look up and see the trees on Cangshan Mountain, each one clearly and quietly standing tall. The earth is shrouded in a silvery light. Guests who come to Dali from outside must stare and exclaim in surprise:</p>
<p>"What a beautiful moonlit night!..."</p>
<p>But, piercing through the surrounding white mist, you cannot find a full moon. This moonless moonlit night makes people wonder if they are dreaming!</p>
<p>Desolate, bright, fresh, and refreshing, this night in Dali! It is as if it is not of this world! The atmosphere is so quiet and bright.</p>
<p>Arriving in Dali on this moonless moonlit night makes one feel as if they have stepped into a paradise, and their mind and spirit are lightened ten thousand times. This should be a mountain and river to be intoxicated with, a place to be reluctant to leave!</p>
<p>However, who can always remember Dali, which seems to be dreaming a beautiful dream? Who can visit it more often?</p>
<p>The Bai Li Erhai Lake of green water, the Cangshan Mountain of green mountains embracing Dali, and the scenery of the moonless moonlit night.</p>
<p>When will I be able to see your beauty again?</p>
<h3 id="e273">What Should Essays on Natural Science Actually Be About? <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Chao Jian</p>
<p>I myself have never written a scientific essay, so it is quite arrogant of me to say that other people's scientific essays are almost all badly written. If someone asked: What should essays on natural science actually be about? This question would leave me speechless, because I myself have never planned this matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down some of the things that come to my mind at the moment. As for the places that are not enough or wrong, I hope that some friends will come out to supplement or correct them.</p>
<p>First, essays on natural science should seem to point out the shortcomings of current natural science, especially the shortcomings in methodology; because neither deduction nor induction can refute the many accumulated empirical materials.</p>
<p>Second, they should point out the inappropriateness of past natural scientists refusing to adopt new methods; at the same time, they should also point out that they had already intentionally or unintentionally adopted a part of the new methods in practice.</p>
<p>Third, they should remind ordinary natural scientists to abandon the attitude of only caring about "nature" and not caring about "society"; because the development of natural science, its prosperity, and its temporary stagnation are all closely related to people's lives.</p>
<p>Fourth, progressive methods should be used to organize the materials obtained from experience in each discipline; at the same time, the inherent organization and process of these materials should be discovered. The law of motion should be used to replace the law of cause and effect. By doing so, the foundation of each discipline will be built on its own contradictions, so that all of its materials constitute an organic system.</p>
<p>Fifth, the various disciplines of natural science should be connected into a network organization; the shifts from one discipline to another should be discovered in themselves.</p>
<p>Sixth, the special manifestations of new methods in natural science should be pointed out; at the same time, the general manifestations of new methods in thinking and social science should be pointed out.</p>
<p>Seventh, the achievements obtained by the above methods should be used to enrich the content of philosophy. On the one hand, they will make those distorted theories lose their last refuge.</p>
<p>Eighth, when you and I are shouting about saving the country, some people are also shouting the slogan of "saving the country through science and engineering." In recent publications, some people are also talking a lot about "science and engineering." We should point out which station current natural science has reached; how should we "catch up" to be called that; how should we not "chase the butt." And to point out how much relationship there is between science and engineering and saving the country.</p>
<p>Ninth, we should conduct a review of domestic publications such as "Science," "Science Quarterly," and "Scientific China" published in recent years. In this venue, we should also remind some people in the past that it is inappropriate to "only care about society and not nature."</p>
<p>Of course, many of the above questions can only be regarded as a goal at present, and cannot be implemented immediately. The question of "science and engineering" for "saving the country," the question of the old natural science taking the position of the "new" philosophy, have already been placed in front of us waiting for us to study, haven't they?</p>
<h3 id="e274">Little Ox and A-Fu <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>After two consecutive days of northwest winds, this morning when I woke up, the red sunlight was shining on the glass windows; the wind no longer howled, and the sky was clear, but it was cold. I happened to go to the window to look out and saw that the bottom of the small river was already visible. I remembered that yesterday evening, the river was still full, which I found a bit strange. Looking ahead, the large pond connected to the small river was also empty. It turned out that the sluice gate had been opened, draining the water, and many people were catching fish.</p>
<p>I could vaguely see fish flashing brightly on the raised nets. To get a clearer view, I washed my face and went over there.</p>
<p>The school foreman, Changsheng, was already standing there before me, asking a thin, tall man, "Little Ox, how many fish have you caught?"</p>
<p>"Only two or three," Little Ox replied, looking up, his bronze-colored face splattered with mud. He put in a lot of effort, taking a step, then throwing himself down to feel around with both hands. Then he took another step and repeated the same action.</p>
<p>"A-Fu! Are you here to catch fish too?"</p>
<p>Hearing Changsheng's question, I turned my head and saw a smiling young man, a newcomer.</p>
<p>"I'm here to catch fish. Do you want some?"</p>
<p>A-Fu replied like this while slowly rolling up his trousers; he lit a cigarette, biting it in his mouth, before slowly stepping into the pond.</p>
<p>Once in the middle of the pond, A-Fu just stood in a pool of water, quietly waiting. When he saw ripples on the surface, he quickly reached down, immediately grabbing a white fish, which he stuffed into the basket on his back as it flailed its tail.</p>
<p>The preparatory bell rang loudly. I had a class, so I hurried back to school. After the first class, I had congee for breakfast. I had no classes for the second and third periods, so I strolled back to the pond to watch them catch fish again. A-Fu was nowhere to be seen, but Little Ox was still taking a step, throwing himself down to feel around with both hands; then he took another step and repeated the same action.</p>
<p>His trouser legs were covered in mud, and there was no skin visible on his arms, as if they were two sections of muddy lotus root. Occasionally, he straightened up to stretch his back. Oh! His face was revealed, now covered with large black speckles. But he immediately bent down again,</p>
<p>still taking a step, throwing himself down to feel around with both hands; then taking another step and repeating the same action.</p>
<p>In the evening, Changsheng brought me dinner. After setting out the food basket, he smiled at me and then asked, "Mr. Xu! Do you want to eat fish? If you want some, I can bring it to you!"</p>
<p>"Did you catch fish too?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," he replied, "Little Ox gave it to me. Speaking of which—Mr. Xu! Let me tell you; Little Ox and A-Fu both went to catch fish today, as you saw this morning. Little Ox worked harder and caught more. A-Fu arrived after Little Ox had been catching fish for a while. Little Ox was among the first to go. A-Fu only fished for an hour before leaving, while Little Ox was the last to leave. Naturally, Little Ox caught a bit more fish, maybe about half as much again. Actually, A-Fu caught fish faster, about four or five catties in an hour. Little Ox, in four or five hours, only caught about seven or eight catties in total. But A-Fu made more money; he rushed to sell his fish first, getting 24 cents a catty, and sold out quickly. When Little Ox carried his to sell, he could only get 16 cents a catty, and nobody wanted to buy it because they had already bought fish; also, it was late, and people were already eating lunch. Later, he could only sell it for 10 cents a catty, and still couldn't sell it all. He had no choice but to give it away, and he gave me one!"</p>
<p>Having said this, Changsheng stared at me, looking rather melancholic. I said that my stomach hadn't been feeling well lately and I couldn't eat fish, so he reluctantly walked away.</p>
<p>People are inherently either clever or not; not clever is called foolish. If there were no foolish people, there would be no such thing as cleverness.</p>
<h3 id="e275">The Human World (10) (1) <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>"No! No! You can't open today without me!"</p>
<p>"Then can you wait until twelve o'clock? We can't take customers until after ten, maybe it will be about right then."</p>
<p>She stepped back again, pleading.</p>
<p>"No! No!"</p>
<p>The Korean wanted the money; he had to get the money no matter what.</p>
<p>He was truly unreasonable, simply not letting anyone speak. But why was he being so unfriendly? Even if she owed him money, surely he could wait a few hours.</p>
<p>He retorted even more angrily:</p>
<p>"Other money can wait, but this money can't be paid on time!"</p>
<p>Now, it became even clearer to me that he was exercising his authority in the opium den business, which was why he could be so unreasonable. He was indeed the master of the opium den. The madam answered him meekly, like a mouse in front of an old cat, not daring to utter a single sound.</p>
<p>Finding no other way and unable to plead any further, the madam took off a gold ring from her own hand and another from Xiaoju's hand, placing them in Mr. Jin's hands, still saying with a smile:</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Jin, would you please be so kind as to sell these for us?"</p>
<p>Who says their lives are easy? They are truly pitiful; they are slaves of slaves! Yes, my trip was not in vain; thanks to the guidance of my friend, I finally opened my mind to the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Xiaoju stood there blankly; my friend remained silent, but his flushed face and heavy breathing clearly showed that he was angry with this stranger. What was he angry about? Disrupting his good time? As for me, I felt that if people are born into this world and are unwilling to strive for progress, wanting only to live a life of complacent ease, they will be trampled upon by others for eternity!</p>
<p>What was unfolding before me was a perfect example.</p>
<p>The madam took this opportunity to explain the situation, as if afraid we wouldn't understand. She said that this was the monthly fee that had to be paid, and she didn't blame Mr. Jin for being angry, only herself for not having enough money beforehand. Then she smiled and asked Mr. Jin not to take it to heart. Mr. Jin didn't reply, tucked the rings into his pocket, and strode out without greeting anyone.</p>
<p>"Let's go too."</p>
<p>With that, my friend and I said goodbye to them and walked back onto the dark path. I instinctively felt that my feet were walking in another world, but no, I still hadn't escaped the human world, hadn't slipped out of this Harbin human world.</p>
<p>I have opened my mind to the ways of the world. I have definitely opened my mind to the ways of the world. (The End)</p>

<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>(2) Changes in Pricing Standards</p>
<p>Before the European War, London was the financial center of the world, and its economic power in the Far East was immense. Therefore, Shanghai's gold bar pricing was based on the British pound. After the outbreak of the European War, the finances of Europe were disrupted, and our country's gold bar pricing also abandoned the gold pound and switched to Japanese gold. By the end of 1931, after Japan abandoned the gold standard, the Japanese exchange rate fell sharply, and our country no longer opened Japanese exchanges. Shanghai gold bars then switched to the American exchange rate as the pricing standard. After the United States abandoned the gold standard in April 1933, until December of last year, the American exchange rate fluctuated unpredictably, and the future trend of Roosevelt's monetary policy was even more unfathomable. It was rumored at the time that the current currency would be devalued. Therefore, the Shanghai Gold Exchange, in order to prevent changes from occurring, passed a new regulation on February 2nd of last year, changing the basis to the British exchange rate to seek a new price for the American exchange rate. From the standpoint of stable value, the existing transactions would still be cleared according to the old method. Until March, that is, at the settlement of the March term, each gold bar was priced at US$240 as the standard. At the same time, a new method was created to change the calculation method for gold bar pricing. For each gold bar with a fineness of .978 and a weight of 8.525 Shanghai taels, starting from February 16th, the April term would be listed and held. At the time of settlement, each gold bar would be priced at US$346 as the standard. Therefore, the difference between the March term and the April term market prices reached more than one hundred yuan. According to the usual practice, gold bar pricing was based on the American exchange rate, with each gold bar valued at US$240. At the same time, the weighing of gold bars was based on Shanghai taels. At that time, the Executive Yuan issued an order to switch to market taels when new transactions began to be traded in the April term. The conversion rate of market taels to Shanghai taels was 85.25. On March 1st of last year, the United States officially announced the legal gold price, with each ounce at $35 and each US dollar devalued to 59.06 cents. Therefore, the new fineness set by the US dollar and the new weight set by Shanghai gold bars were mutually converted, and the calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(240 + .5906) x .8525 = 346.427. Therefore, after the gold bar was re-weighed and the US dollar revalued, the new converted gold bar value was US$346.427 per gold bar. Because of this change, the method of calculating the gold bar pricing is as follows:</p>
<p>$346.427 ÷ (the market price of the US exchange rate on that day) = 1018.8 yuan (gold bar pricing)</p>
<p>On October 15th of last year, the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent gold bar speculation, managed the buying and selling of gold bars and ordered that the pricing of gold bars must be based on the customs gold unit listed by the Central Bank. Each gold bar is equal to ten market taels, with a fineness of .978. Each market tael is equal to 482.2611 grains of pure gold, and each grain is actually equal to .064798918 grams of pure gold. Therefore, each gold bar is actually equal to 305.62 grams.</p>
<p>10 x .978 x 482.2611 x .06479818 = 305.62 grams</p>
<p>Now, one customs gold unit is equivalent to .601866 grams, so the number of customs gold units obtained for one gold bar should be 507.79.</p>
<p>305.62 / .601866 = 507.79 customs gold units (fixed number)</p>
<p>Suppose the market price of customs gold on this day is 1.949 yuan. Then the market price of the gold bar should be 989.68 national currency.</p>
<p>507.79 x 1.949 = 989.68 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Suppression of Foreign Exchange Gold Bar Speculation</p>
<p>On September 9th of last year, the Ministry of Finance instructed Shanghai banks to restrict foreign exchange trading. The general meaning of the instruction was: foreign exchange transactions, except for (1) those necessary for legal and normal business operations, (2) private needs in the 1934. At the same time, the Gold Exchange was ordered to crack down on gold bar speculation. All new transactions should be conducted in cash, and the use of foreign exchange pricing was no longer allowed. Therefore, economists convened a meeting and decided that the October futures trading should be extended to the end of October due to time constraints. Starting from October 15th, a new standard would be implemented, and the customs gold converted from world gold bullion would be used as the standard for pricing in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Finance then instructed that the old October transactions should be allowed to be extended for one month, and no new transactions should be made. Starting from that day, a new standard would be implemented, and the customs gold price listed by the Central Bank, calculated according to the London gold bullion, would be used as the pricing standard. After a resolution by the board of directors of the Gold Exchange, the November term would be extended for settlement from October 17th, and the December futures would be opened at the same time.</p>
<p>The reason why the Ministry of Finance cracked down on gold bar speculation was that in recent years, the trend of gold bar speculation on the exchange has been very rampant. The buying and selling of gold bars is actually unnecessary, relying on the whims of foreign exchange as a speculative trend. When the US dollar is high, people rush to buy, and gold bars rise accordingly. Conversely, they are afraid of being left behind, and gold bars fall again. In fact, it is like gambling, which only disrupts the gold bar market. Moreover, the power of foreign exchange is controlled by foreigners, so that in the blink of an eye, countless people are ruined. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely crack down on it, not only to protect the lives and property of the people, but also to stabilize social finance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason for cracking down on the use of foreign exchange for gold bar pricing and replacing it with the Central Bank's customs gold listing as the standard is that the Central Bank's customs gold listing is based on the London bullion and the market price of gold bars. In other words, gold bar pricing is based on the customs gold unit, on the one hand, so that the price of gold is placed under the natural state of gold and silver supply and demand in London, and is not manipulated by human forces. (London is where gold and silver mine owners and merchants gather, so its bullion value usually represents the natural price of gold and silver supply and demand.) On the other hand, the focus of exchange is shifted from HSBC to the Central Bank, so that the Central Bank's function in exchange is expanded, and the possibility of gradually controlling the price of gold is enabled. Having considerable control over the price of gold can stabilize it, not following the fluctuating US dollar. This not only pleases businessmen, allowing them to have a definite calculation of the value of their goods, but also establishes a glorious authority in our country's exchange industry. However, its complete realization still requires considerable effort. — January 9, 1935. (The End)</p>

<p>Unfinished Procedures for the Closing of Silver Firms</p>
<p>This year's sluggish market is unprecedented since Shanghai was opened as a trading port. Therefore, the turnover ability of various industries is quite difficult. Generally, silver firms concentrate cash but have no way out, which makes it difficult to bridge the gaps. The continuous bankruptcies of stores have been endless, and the indirect and direct burdens are mostly unavoidable. Therefore, it is expected that this year's big closing will be more difficult than in previous years. The market atmosphere is outwardly relaxed but inwardly tight. The open market rate for foreign exchange is still 8%, the same price in the morning and afternoon. The dark market is actually only quoted, not traded. Most people are seeking prudence and are unwilling to release funds rashly, so the market atmosphere is rather calm. The trading volume of clearinghouse bills and bank collections, due to the weekly holiday, has no news to report. The trading volume of call loans was over 1.3 million in the morning session for transfers, over 200,000 for new transactions, over 400,000 in the afternoon session, and over 50,000 in the Small General Association. The trading volume of foreign exchange collateral loans was only over 400,000 for redemption by money shops and over 600,000 for new loans. The remittances from various places were over 300,000. The collection of foreign public single bills by money shops was over 29 million. The annual settlement of other silver firms was over 2 million. The inflow and outflow situation is not very smooth.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins (auxiliary coinage), in both the morning and afternoon markets, were uniformly priced at 848 yuan, an increase of three yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Transactions amounted to 2,000 *jiao* in the morning market and 2,500 *jiao* in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 751 yuan in the morning market and 751.5 *jiao* in the afternoon market, with a difference of 5 *jiao* between the two markets. Transactions totaled 185,000 *jiao* in the morning market and 75,000 *jiao* in the afternoon market.

<p>Bond Market Trended Downward Last Week</p>
<p>From January 21st to 26th of last week, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced the final week of January futures trading. The environment was turbulent and fraught with disturbances. Although the surface silver exchange rate retreated to 8 *fen*, this was not related to the actual tightness of the silver market. The collapse of Tongyi Bank further exposed the cracks in the sluggish business climate. Observing the changing situation, which tightened and loosened unexpectedly, especially as settlement approached, was enough to incite infighting. With the Lunar New Year approaching and a long holiday period imminent, most traders were unwilling to hold positions for too long, fearing the dangers of changes during the holiday. Therefore, the March futures, which would be listed simultaneously with the reopening on February 8th for the remaining two days, were not expected to experience much price fluctuation. Over the past week, on Monday, it appeared that the situation would not escalate. However, the sudden collapse of Tongyi Bank raised concerns about potential repercussions in the silver market. Confidence plummeted, and large holders rushed to sell. However, the "Northern Faction" and "No. 16" groups bought in at the lower prices. Market prices rose slightly across three sessions, recovering somewhat by closing, but still down two or three *jiao*, to seven or eight *jiao*. On Tuesday, there was great hope for a peaceful resolution of the situation. The "Northern Faction" actively covered their short positions. Although many large holders also sold, the market saw demand exceeding supply, creating a slight short squeeze. On Wednesday, the "Northern Faction" and "No. 16" continued to cover, and market prices continued to rise, with the short squeeze intensifying, pushing prices up another three to five *jiao*, to seven *jiao*. On Thursday, a sudden conflict arose, and the news differed greatly from before. The market, which had just experienced a short squeeze, abruptly shifted to a long squeeze, causing a severe drop. The "Northern Faction" also sold heavily, leading to a sharp fall of two yuan at the opening. Although there was some rebound, the result was still a drop of several *jiao*, to one yuan and two or three *jiao*. Friday was the final day of January futures trading, and there was a renewed short squeeze, with prices rising by two or three *jiao*, to about half a yuan. On Saturday, only February futures were traded, and with the situation remaining unresolved, confidence waned, and prices fell again by three to five *jiao*. Overall, during the week, January contracts mostly rose by one or two *jiao*, to one yuan and one or two *jiao*, while February contracts mostly fell by one or two *jiao*, to six or seven *jiao*. The total trading volume amounted to 13,115,100 yuan. The resulting price changes are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Trading Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>Foreign Cotton Mostly Fell Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and sluggish spot trading. Prices for all months fell by four to seven points. After the market price declined slightly, dealers engaged in buying, but the volume of transactions was not high, so the range of fluctuations was not large. At the close, there was some short covering, resulting in a slight firming. Spot prices were unchanged, while futures prices fell by two to four points. The British cotton market was quiet and dull. Spot prices fell by two points, while futures prices fell by one point. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering, but weakened later due to selling by European exporters. Bengal fell by three rupees, while Omra and White Broach both fell by one and a half rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 26th)</p>

<p>Rice Market Continues to Plunge</p>
<p>Thick *Geng* Rice Down 1.3 Jiao, Late Rice Down 3-4 Jiao</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly scarcer than before, with only about a dozen or twenty firms arriving (totaling over 6,000 *shi*). However, due to the previous slow sales of *Puzhongzai* rice, vendors, facing the end of the year, and having sufficient remaining stock, were eager to sell quickly, and had no choice but to lower prices to seek sales. This led to a revitalized after-sales market, allowing existing stocks to be cleared. As for orders from customers, the Qingdao and Yantai gangs continued to handle over 2,000 bags. As a result, prices for thick *geng* rice and late rice, among others, continued to plummet by as much as three or four *jiao*. However, the future market situation seems to have stabilized. Various grades of "Yinbianyuan" rice also experienced declines of two or three *jiao*, up to four or five *jiao*. "Duyangjian" rice was out of stock and had no market.</p>

<p>Limited Delivery Volume of Flour</p>
<p>Most Receivers Are Local Merchants</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast of Market Conditions on the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for January flour futures. The overall delivery volume for the day was not brisk, as the goods from various factories were gradually taken away by customers. A portion was also withdrawn in advance for hedging purposes. As a result, only 22,000 bags of "Green Cannon Platform" from Xin Da were delivered, half of which were returned goods, and the other half were new warehouse receipts for the "Foot Pedal" brand from Fufeng, totaling 2,000 bags. The majority of the receivers were local merchants, while customers only took 3,000 to 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>The Happy Broadcasting Station of the local Lao Ximen (Old West Gate) has specially contracted with Zhi Shi Yong, located at No. 11 Xingye Lane, Tianzhutang Street, to broadcast flour market conditions. At 11:00 AM, it will report the opening and closing prices of the pre-market session. At 4:00 PM, it will report the opening and closing prices of the afternoon session. Those in the local and external communities who wish to stay informed about flour market conditions should tune in at the specified times for more detailed information.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Another January 28th Incident <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Another January 28th! This painful scar, although three years have passed since that day, has not only failed to heal but has even worsened! The deadly blow the enemy dealt us was so severe! The spirit of our people has not died, and we will certainly avenge this humiliation one day!</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident was a conspiracy launched by Japan following the September 18th Incident. This conspiracy had a far-reaching plan. Not only did it have a far-reaching plan, but the plan was also consistent. Look! After the loss of the three northeastern provinces, Japan's ambitions were not satisfied, and they further invaded Shanghai. When the Shanghai Battle failed, they turned to seize Rehe. Later, they repeatedly disturbed North China and plotted to invade South China. And recently, Eastern Chahar is also in a state of emergency. The Japanese are using every means to plot against us!</p>
<p>After enduring the pain, the people of the country should have an awareness when commemorating this January 28th. That is, although the day of January 28th has passed, the tragedy of January 28th is in danger of being re-enacted anytime, anywhere. Not long ago, the Japanese army and navy stationed in Shanghai again conducted a large-scale armed exercise in the North Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road areas. About two or three thousand soldiers were mobilized at that time. Machine guns, armored vehicles, and tanks were all available. For a time, it shocked the residents of Shanghai. What was this for? It was a demonstration to our Shanghai people! The evening newspapers and the next day's newspapers recorded the incident, all using large-character headlines. One newspaper's title was very startling, writing: "The Tragic Scene of That Day Reappears Today."</p>
<p>"The tragic scene of that day reappearing today" is not necessarily impossible! If the national morale continues to decline like this, without a sudden awakening and revitalization, the future is truly dangerous!</p>
<h3 id="e284">Stepping onto Singapore <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Overseas Student</p>
<p>"Singapore! Look there; on the coast are such tall houses, cars crawling like frogs, crowds of people like ants:..." Standing on the deck, my friend S shouted childishly, while I noticed the flag of the British Empire planted on a skyscraper, swaying in the sea-scented wind, appearing particularly proud in the sunset. Standing there blankly for a long time, the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's XX ship had already stopped, dropped anchor, and the whistle cried loudly twice, suddenly waking me up, "Hey! Get ashore! Singapore has arrived!" S carried his simple luggage, and I carried mine, one in front and one behind, going ashore.</p>
<p>The brokers of the hotels crowded the shore, rushing toward us together, shouting their hotel names. Although we were not familiar with them, we had heard that "Nantian" was the biggest and best. So when we heard the shout "Nantian Hotel! Nantian!", we let the Chinese man with the Malay face check our luggage and took a car to the Nantian Hotel.</p>
<p>Soon, the night hung up like a piece of black cloth.</p>
<p>Like every big city, Singapore comes alive at night. Isn't it? Every room in the Nantian Hotel is active. Mahjong, women, wine, cigarettes: ... the soul of Nantian woven together. Next door is a stage performing a famous Beijing opera, and you can hear the noisy sounds of gongs and drums passing by. On the street; cars, trams, lorries, blew past like the wind, followed by rickshaws and bullock carts. Movie posters appeared on the streets in the most dazzling form, Caoutak showing a film of Shepley! Alhambra showing a film of Garbo! Women's idol Shepley and men's object Garbo, are mercilessly stealing their audience in Singapore. And I, "Let's go to the movies!" I said to S, and hailed a rickshaw to Capital.</p>
<p>The wide roads were filled with countless crowds. A broadcasting machine outside the department store transmitted the songs most adept at by black American. The night news recorded the turmoil of Europe and the coming of the Second World War. Now, Singapore's naval port has been completed under the British Empire's painstaking management; the day the great war arrives, what kind of fate will this only metropolis of the Malay Peninsula encounter!</p>
<p>At midnight, returning to the fifth floor of Nantian from Shepely's laughter, having been at rest for two hours, S was already asleep. I pushed open the window, took a breath, and looked up, the sky full of stars shining like countless eyeballs. Occasionally, looking down, I saw a few rickshaws lazily walking on the deserted streets. In the corner covered by the shadow of the skyscraper, there were women selling their bodies standing against the wall. Oh! The impression Singapore gave me was so terrible! There were also ferocious Indian police, patrolling the streets all night, monitoring the actions of every unemployed person:...</p>
<p>Stepping onto the shore of Singapore, I only felt the terror of the metropolis, an uncontrollable tremor made me lose sleep all night, until the next day when the sunlight shone on the bed, S woke up and asked me in surprise, "Didn't you sleep?" I could only sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Anchored at Night <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— San Lang</p>
<p>It was midnight, the black sky hiding such vast black clouds, the distant little stars flashing as if shedding desolate tears, the violent wind on the sea, deeply showing that the winter night in the South was a bit cold, as the steamer had just sailed into Guanghai Bay from the vast sea, the passengers on the whole ship moved and stood at the hatch, carefully watching the luggage, while facing the violent wind stirring the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>What a windy night! I sighed so much, at that time, several sampan women desperately resisted the huge waves, dropping the ferry in front of the hatch of the steamer. Everyone, withstanding the huge wind and flying rain, jumped onto the small ferry.</p>
<p>My seat was beside the boat, so the waves in the dark night flew out silver white, one by one, rustling - what beautiful waves!</p>
<p>When I was watching such a spectacle, I unconsciously had the waves wet my face and clothes, facing the sea breeze mixed with fluttering drizzle, I felt even colder, and my body gradually trembled.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, our ferry berthed on the stone wharf, I jumped on the pier, where high yellow electric lights were hung high, you could clearly see those porters soliciting business, those noisy voices, I felt the terrible strange local flavor deeply.</p>
<p>- Sir - Hey - To Guanghai Bay or Guanghai City?</p>
<p>Several porters endured the cold, stretching and shrinking, surrounding me. I had already planned to call a porter to lead the way in my heart. In this dark night, the strange road is always terrible. At the same time, I secretly feared the tricks of those hooligans, because Guanghai City had been a world of thieves for several years.</p>
<p>- Hey! Does Guang Yuanlong of Guanghai Bay know?</p>
<p>- I know, it is the newly completed shop of Mr. Chen. I'll take you there.</p>
<p>A man in his thirties picked up my things and asked me to follow him. After passing through a memorial arch, he folded into the small road on Gao Shanfeng. At that time, I couldn't see anything, only some hideous rocks were moving in my eyes. No one was walking, no sound, I was shocked - could it be that he was taking me to the thief's den?</p>
<p>So difficult, after several crooked roads, and arrived at the dilapidated street, a long stone street. Looking into the distance are some new houses, very beautiful urban architectural production, but also in the bustling night market sounds. So, I was relieved that I had not been kidnapped by thieves.</p>
<p>When I arrived at my friend's house, I felt the wonder of the front and back of Guanghai Bay Wharf.</p>
<p>- It is a beautiful seaside little city.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Taste of a Wanderer <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Wanderer</p>
<p>I deeply savor the taste of a wanderer:</p>
<p>Riding a huge ocean liner, drifting on the sea that overseas Chinese call the Seven Seas, watching the moonlight rise and fall on the vast, turbulent waves; sailing in a small Malay boat among the creek harbors of Sumatra, watching the tropical forest cover both banks of the open jungle floor; riding a bicycle winding through the Malay plains, watching the red tropical earth stir up dust and smoke under the scorching sun...</p>
<p>In China, I climbed the peak of Hong Kong's Victoria Peak, gazing at the gray, dim homeland across the water; in the famous Suzhou and Hangzhou, where the ancient Chinese soul resides, I deeply tasted the feudal flavor of this ancient land; in the sinful city of Shanghai, I observed the souls of fallen people in the dark corners of the city; and in my hometown, I was suffocated under the dark, giant palm of the ancient nation...</p>
<p>Whenever it is a quiet night, when loneliness bites into the depths of my heart, I often recall the taste of my past wandering, and a wave of melancholy and joy surges through my heart. Thinking of ceaselessly rolling in the crowd in a chaotic era, ceaselessly wandering in a corner of the globe, is already the destiny that history has bestowed upon me. In the future, in order to struggle on the road of life, wandering and drifting seem to never abandon me, and a wave of gray sorrow covers my heart. However, when I think of seeing all kinds of human conditions in constant wandering, and gathering the wisdom of the earth from every corner of the world, if one day I see the bright side of humanity from the struggle of life, then isn't this painful wandering a treasure bestowed upon me by fate?</p>
<p>I remember once wading through puddles of accumulated rain on a long journey through the wild forest paths of Sumatra, stepping through mud and knee-deep water in the wild forest for four long hours. Nervously fearing that huge tropical beasts would come out and bite people, listening to wild birds screeching strangely in the black, thick trees; step by step, sinking my feet into the mud and then struggling to pull them out, pulling them out only to fall back in, watching the setting sun approaching dusk, yet the vast path still showed no sign of people (except for our own companions). How excruciating was the anxiety and hardship at that time! But how pleasant is the recollection now! I think, without this trek, not only would my livelihood at that time not have been resolved, but how could such a profound understanding and love for the equatorial land have left such a deep mark on my life?</p>
<p>I also remember once going with a young companion in a small Malay boat to catch a market fair, rushing along the rapids in a limited time. In a narrow section of the river, suddenly a large wild tree fell from the bank, collapsing across our small boat with a crash like a landslide. At that time, the small boat was being tossed by the tree's branches, and it was almost overturned into the river. Fortunately, the helmsman was skilled in boating, and used all his strength to hold the boat steady. After calming our frightened souls and using the saw we had brought with us to cut off a section of the thick trunk, we were drenched in sweat, and let the boat pass through the gap in the sawn tree. We finally escaped the danger. However, afterwards, when I think that if the small boat had moved forward a little further, wouldn't two young lives have been crushed under that tree trunk? This shocking story makes my heart race whenever I think of it, and the fact that friends had tried to stop me from making this trip makes me not regret it afterwards. Because without this trip, how could I have gone deep into the wilderness? Without this trip, how could I have seen the more primitive faces of the native people of Southeast Asia? Without this trip, how could I have felt so much joy for the knowledge I gained that time?</p>
<p>In China, the benefits given to me by wandering are not few. In the teahouses of Suzhou, I can see the ancient soul of the long-standing nation; on the waves of the Pearl River in southern China, I can see the heroic soul of a nation from its flourishing to its decline; from the capitalist city of Shanghai, I can see the dark face brought about by imperialism...</p>
<p>In the quiet night, I count the joys and pains that past wandering has given me, and a feeling of life's contradictions is intricately woven into my heart. I have quietly thought: if this society can make reasonable adjustments, then in the future, wandering and working in the world, that bright and happy vivid taste will immerse me in it forever. Erasing the dark side, and bringing upward mobility, wandering will become another kind of taste, and I will sing the praises of the wanderer's work anytime, anywhere!</p>
<p>Let the taste of the wanderer pass from the net woven with joy and pain to the only joy, from the two faces woven with darkness and light to the only bright direction! Abandon the suffering of life's wandering, and face the future!</p>

<p>Today is the anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident in Shanghai. All Shanghai Chinese business radio stations will suspend entertainment programs for the day.

<p>"Blood of the Northeast" Plot</p>
<p>The enemy invades our Northeast. A group of passionate young people have no way to join the army. They join the volunteer army one after another. Set off to the front line. Serve the country. Xiao Gou is a patriotic youth in his teens. Finally abandoned his old mother and weak sister at home. Joined the army. Rushed to the front to fight the enemy, wounded and fought hard. Before dying, he shouted loudly: I would rather be a heroic ghost of the Republic of China. I never want to be a slave to a fallen country!</p>
<p>(For details of this play, please read the "Blood of the Northeast" script published by Yuanchang Radio Station. Send a letter with a five-cent stamp to Yuanchang and it will be given as a gift)</p>
<p>"Peanuts" Plot</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the country is about the public. Don't look down on Lin Ren, who sells peanuts. But he also has a patriotic heart. This time, when the bandit army attacked our country's territory, he was willing to throw away his peanut basket and do something big for the country. How great is this spirit!</p>
<p>Lin Ren's younger sister, Ruhua, is born a beauty. Because her brother wanted to work hard for the country. Therefore. She did not hesitate to sacrifice herself to approach the bandits. So that her brother could sneak into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When the two sides signed the Twenty-One Demands. He desperately destroyed the treaty. As a result, he was cut off his nose by the bandits. Eyes gouged out. How terrible and pitiful. Later, his sister finally avenged her brother.</p>
<p>"Soul of the Nation" Plot</p>
<p>Seeing that the country was in trouble, Zhang Tianhua did not want to see the country perish. So he joined the army. He said goodbye to his lover to serve the country. This scene made people sad. But his lover. It's also bloody. Determined to join the army too. Secretly protect his lover. In the end, he sacrificed for the country. Only then did he find his lover.</p>
<p>"Night of January 28th" Plot</p>
<p>The "Night of January 28th" Incident broke out suddenly. I don’t know how many people were killed. Old Zhao Fengting and his daughter Mei Zhen fled to escape. On the way, they encountered the corpse of their son Xiao Mao. Hit the vital point in the gun. The old man was crying in pain. He was hit and killed by stray bullets again. (For details and dialogue, see the second issue of Mimi Collection published by Yuanchang Radio Station.)</p>

<h3 id="e291">George Raft's Tuxedo Worth $3,500 USD <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>Do you believe it or not, George Raft once spent $3,500 USD to make a tuxedo? But that is the fact. Let me tell you about it.</p>
<p>That was an anecdote from when George Raft was still humble, in New York. Few people know about it. Only now an old friend has told it for him. He is rich now, dressed neatly, walking out of his dressing room. He was wearing a dinner suit, and he met the old friend, and pointed to his clothes, asking him: "Look, how is it? Not bad, eh?" The friend said slowly: "Well, not bad. But, do you remember that $3,500 one?" After George walked away, the friend told the story of the $3,500.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when George was dancing at the Texas Guinan nightclub in New York, he took two weeks off after a period of hard work to rest. On the first night of his rest, he ran to a Kirkleigh gambling den on 56th Street. The dice were his own choice. He wasn't rich at that time, so the bets he placed were naturally small and very careful. But that day was the day that the God of Gamblers was taking on a disciple. George Raft was lucky in gambling, and after an hour, he had already won three thousand five hundred dollars. That was the most money he had ever won in his life. He was so excited that he asked a friend next to him, who is now telling this story: "What time does the boat to London leave tonight?" He said: "Twelve o'clock." George asked again: "What time is it now?" He said: "Half past ten." George quickly stuffed a large roll of colorful paper into his pocket, grabbed his friend, and ran out. He said: "I'm going to London tonight, I have urgent business!"</p>
<p>Without further ado, George did indeed take that boat to London. The reason why he traveled across the ocean to London, England, was only told by George himself after returning to New York. He said:</p>
<p>"I have a quirk, which is that I like to dress well. Where did that quirk come from? Let me tell you. At that time, I was dancing in various nightclubs in New York. Texas Guinan gave me something to do. She told me to meet her. I had never been to any high-class nightclubs, so I didn't know what was inside. So I tried my best to dress myself up, wearing what I thought was the most beautiful outfit - a purple shirt, plus a fiery red tie.</p>
<p>"When I walked into the nightclub, I looked around, and everyone was wearing dinner suits, snow-white hard shirts. I suddenly felt my face flushing. That red bow tie almost burned a big hole in my purple shirt. I looked around, found the nearest exit, and without meeting Texas Guinan, I quickly slipped out. From then on, I knew what it meant to dress in a high-class way. From then on, I got this quirk of being particular about dressing.</p>
<p>"Later, I also developed the habit of wearing dinner suits. Every night, I wouldn't dare to meet people without wearing formal attire. At that time, my only ambition was to wear the most exquisite tuxedo that money could buy. That night, I won three thousand five hundred dollars out of nowhere in the gambling den. I thought I was probably happy for a moment, and went crazy. I immediately thought of London, England, which is famous for making tuxedos, so I thought of going to London and having them make me the most exquisite tuxedo.</p>
<p>"So I took that boat to London and ordered a tuxedo from the most famous H. Huntsman &amp; Sons clothing store."</p>
<p>Of course, a tuxedo wouldn't cost that much money. But when I returned to New York, I was empty-handed and penniless.</p>
<p>"When I was on the boat back, I won some games of billiards on the boat. When the boat left Southampton, I counted my money, and it had decreased by a bit, but there was still a full two thousand dollars, and a brand new tuxedo. I thought to myself, since I'm so lucky, why not gamble big. So I joined a poker game. Unexpectedly, this time was bad, I met the old ghosts. They gave me a big lesson. By the time I arrived in New York and got ashore, I was already a pauper.</p>
<p>"But not entirely. I thought I was a pauper, but after a while, I found a small ten-dollar gold coin in the pocket of the tuxedo. That was also the first money I had ever won at the Kirkleigh gambling den."</p>

<h3 id="e292">Review of "Are We Civilized?" <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"Are We Civilized?" / Da Guangming</p>
<p>I almost cannot help but admit to the readers that I was deeply moved by "Are We Civilized?" Although it still contains some shortcomings. (As for why the original name was translated into "An Anthology of Ancient and Modern Wonders," that is incomprehensible.)</p>
<p>The cruelty of the First World War left a very painful memory for the people of European and American countries. The war destroyed their homes, the war turned the world into a cemetery, and the war destroyed human civilization. Therefore, from not long after the war until now, we have seen many films about the World War, and among them there are many famous films against imperialist wars. Obviously, progressive, humanitarian filmmakers abhor war, and they oppose war, all of which are expressed in their works.</p>
<p>Now, twenty years after the First World War, the Second World War is on the verge of breaking out again. The expansion of armaments by various imperialist countries shows that the contradictions between them cannot be resolved without war. These have been seen by American filmmakers with a sense of justice, and their concerns are expressed in their works. In this regard, we can cite "The World Moves On" as an example, although it is a shortcoming of the work that it equates strengthening the armed forces for the sake of improving human life with the imperialist expansion of armaments. Now we have also seen Edwin Carewe's film against the Second World War.</p>
<p>So, let's see how he understands the true meaning of war? What attitude does he take to oppose war? From this point of view, give the work a proper evaluation. Here, the author is a righteous and humanitarian advocate for peace. He explains that human progress is from barbarism to civilization. And it is because of this civilization that the First World War was brewed, but this war destroyed the world's civilization. Now this barbaric Second World War is about to come again, so the author disguises himself as a scholar and preaches to the warmongers, painstakingly and sparing no effort to sacrifice himself, and as a result, the scholar's childhood friend, the general who holds military and political power, is also moved by him. However, this is precisely the shortcoming of the work. The outbreak of the war is by no means something that a small number of warlike people can create. Therefore, preaching to the officers here cannot eliminate war. Furthermore, the so-called peace between imperialists is the preparation for war, and true peace can only be obtained by eliminating imperialist wars through new and old wars. Therefore, the World War is anti-progressive, it is a barbaric act of civilized people, and the war to eliminate the war that hinders progress is what we need.</p>
<p>The work does not have a clear indication of these, which shows that Edwin Carewe is still stuck in the old worldview. Therefore, this is a relatively realistic work, but it does not penetrate deeply into the essence of reality in a critical way.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, perhaps this is too demanding of the author. To take a step back, it is very gratifying to see such a righteous anti-war work appearing in the United States on the eve of the Second World War. At least the author's attitude is very serious. It is a very clear fact that the author has adopted a very simple approach to express his own ideas completely, so we can certainly point out many shortcomings in the technology, but this is by no means a fatal damage to the work. The main thing is that in addition to the insufficient expression of the form, there are still some errors in the content.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Review of "Down to Their Last Yacht" <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>"Down to Their Last Yacht" / Da Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>The socialite Nila buys the only old yacht of the bankrupt girl Lingdai, and invites many dignitaries, wealthy merchants and magnates to travel to the South China Sea.</p>
<p>In order to maintain her livelihood, Lingdai still serves as a servant on the ship. Her lover Forbes was rejected when he asked to go with her, so he and his personal servant Freddie found a way to hide on the ship and follow her.</p>
<p>The shipowner intends to plunder the wealth of all the passengers, deliberately runs the ship aground, and goes to a deserted island to plan a robbery with the queen. Who knows that the queen does not lack money and wealth, but lacks handsome men. So among all the sailors and passengers who came to seek refuge, she fell in love with Forbes, this pretty boy, and wanted him to be her husband and king. She does not care whether Forbes is engaged to anyone, and orders all the natives of the island to open a celebration banquet for the wedding and abdication. Suddenly, outside the band, a man blowing a bugle appears, saying that he looks like her husband, so she abandons Forbes and desperately loves him.</p>
<p>The ship was playfully destroyed by the queen, and all the people were left on the desert island to live their lives of singing, dancing, love, and unbridled indulgence.</p>
<p>For this kind of story propped up by jade-like thighs, creamy breasts, singing, dancing, passionate love, and crazy kisses, we cannot make any more meaningful demands on it. General fragile and disillusioned people, when they are so disappointed with their lives that they cannot even trust themselves, try their best to laugh before death. Fantasy and fantasy, what absurd, strange, and arrogant things can't they think of?</p>
<p>In order to escape reality, reality gives these pleasure-seekers a more positive display, but fantasy is always being shattered. No matter how hard "Down to Their Last Yacht" struggles, it cannot avoid being stained with the atmosphere of similar films in the previous period. Primitive sexual love, from the rapid, wild, fresh, and unrestrained pursuit, has declined into a fluctuating, weak, old, floating, and astringent yearning.</p>
<p>From the handling methods to the tone and atmosphere shown, they are as described above. Not only is the large segment of shipboard life lackluster, but even the various things after arriving on the desert island are not flavorful enough. For example, a group of noble and gorgeous people stand on the ship's railing watching a group of naked men singing under the trees on the shore. That scene was so dull until the lengthy singing was over before there was some change. The queen's sensual performance cannot be well unified with the action. The turmoil between the natives and the refugees, individually and piecemeal, lacks splashing, open scenes on the screen, and the melodies lack the grandeur of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Because the performers focus their efforts on singing and dancing, the actors inevitably lack outstanding achievements.</p>

<p>Li Lili's love and marriage have truly become a problem. Initially, in "Little Toys," she and Luo Peng were in love. In "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp," it was almost because of Luo Peng's personality that the two got married. Now, in the "National Customs" co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin, the love and marriage issues surrounding Li Lili are even more complicated. Originally, Lili was fond of Zheng Junli and finally she won and married Zheng Junli. However, not long after marrying Zheng Junli, Lili changed due to changes in the environment. Although Zheng Junli later almost went bankrupt providing her with money for education, she didn't care about it at all. As a result, Zheng Junli was abandoned. Who did Lili fall in love with? In the end, she still had a fate with Luo Peng. Because since they cooperated in plays, they have always played loving roles, so people generally say: "Lili and Little Luo can be called a pair of screen lovers."</p>

<p>The sound film "The Red Sheep Heroic Legend," which promotes the national spirit, is Xinhua Film Company's maiden work. It was informally screened yesterday, and reporters got a sneak peek. The actors in this film, such as Xu Qinfang, Tian Fang, Yan Ying, and Wang Zhengqing, all have enthusiastic voices and sincere expressions. Wang Huchen and Tong Yuejuan have transitioned from the stage to the silver screen. Stage plays and film plays each have their own unique position and nature. Wang Huchen plays Wei Changhui in the Red Sheep sound film, and Tong Yuejuan plays a wandering singing girl. They have completely shed their habitual postures on stage, which is particularly commendable. The most magnificent scenes include Wei Changhui's late-night visit to Hong Xuanjiao in prison to learn swordsmanship, and the burning of villages during the Jintian Uprising. The blazing flames, the impassioned military songs, and the earth-shaking sounds are rarely seen in domestic films. It is said that it will be released on the first day of the Lunar New Year, and it will surely cause a sensation among the people of Shanghai at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e296">The Red Sheep Heroic Legend (7) <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>Outside Jintian Village, white cloth banners were hung, with the words "Welcome Mr. Wei Changhui" written on them. Many small flags and lanterns hanging under the eaves also had the same words written on them. Wei Changhui sat on his horse, looking around. Shi Dakai followed behind, urging the horse forward and pointing ahead, saying, "Brother Wei! The ones standing at the entrance of the village are Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing." Wei then looked forward and said, "Such heavy etiquette is truly undeserved." Upon arriving at the village entrance, Wei and the others dismounted. Hong Xiuquan stepped forward to greet them with great respect. Three cannons were fired, and music was played loudly. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, they were welcomed inside. A banquet was set up in the hall, with Wei Changhui sitting in the center, and Hong, Yang, Zeng, and Shi sitting beside him in order. Hong Xiuquan poured wine and, holding the cup in his hand, said to Wei, "Today, we are honored that Mr. Wei does not despise our humble selves and joins our society. This is truly the supreme honor and is enough to encourage our fighting spirit." Saying this, he raised the cup and said, "Let's all drink this cup of wine and wish Mr. Wei good health." Everyone stood up and drank it all. After drinking a cup, Wei replied with a smile, "I am truly undeserving of such generous treatment from everyone. I am an ordinary person who originally wanted to do something, but I had no opportunity. Now that I have joined your esteemed society, this is truly the time for me to strive and be promising. As long as the mission of you brothers is within my ability, I will do my best to do it." Everyone at the table listened attentively. Hearing the last words, they all applauded and raised their cups to drink. At this time, the courtyard was crowded with people, and various lantern dances and acrobatics were being performed in the courtyard. The Beijing opera was also being performed on the stage. Let's leave the excitement aside for now.</p>
<p>It is said that one day, everyone was sitting and chatting idly in Jintian Village when suddenly a horse galloped in and dismounted at the village entrance. It was Qin Rigang, looking flustered and panicked. He rushed inside. Everyone was shocked to see Qin rushing in. Qin Rigang was distraught and unable to speak clearly: "Something bad has happened! Brother Hong Xiuquan has been arrested by the Guiping County government!" Several people stood up in shock and asked, "What happened?" Wei and Zeng also stood up and asked, "How could this happen?" Qin Rigang panted and said, "I accompanied Brother Hong to the county to take care of something. There was a yamen runner in the county who came from Guangdong. When he saw Brother Hong, he reported to the official, saying that Brother Hong had committed a crime in Huaxian, propagating the teachings of Jesus and plotting against the court. The county then sent yamen runners to follow us halfway and arrest Brother Hong." Xiao Chaogui was furious when he heard this and said, "This plague official dares to oppose us! Let's quickly kill our way into the city and rescue Brother Hong!" Saying this, he was indignant. Hong Xuanjiao also shouted, "Let's kill our way into the city today!" Yang Xiuqing and Feng Yunshan were both concerned when they heard this. Yang shook his head slightly and said, "Now is not the time for us to start an uprising. We cannot easily reveal ourselves." Qin Rigang hurriedly shouted from the side, "We can't just let Brother Hong be trapped in prison without doing anything!" Wei Changhui then said to everyone, "I have a plan, I don't know if everyone will agree. I know that the magistrate of Guiping County is a corrupt official. If we use more bribes, I can guarantee that Brother Hong will return safely." Zeng Wangheng listened and then said, "This method is the most stable. If it really doesn't work, then we will do as Brother Xiao said." Wei Changhui then cupped his hands to everyone and said, "The matter should not be delayed, I will go to the city immediately to take care of this matter." Everyone saw Wei Changhui off. Wei said to everyone, "Everyone, sit and wait for good news!" Saying that, he mounted his horse and left. As expected, money can work miracles. Hong Xiuquan was released from Guiping County thanks to Wei Changhui's rescue. Hong Xiuquan said to the crowd, "This time, we were fortunate to have Mr. Wei's help, otherwise, we would have suffered their poisonous hands. However, I think the government will find us sooner or later. We must be determined to prepare." Xiao Chaogui stepped forward and said, "We should kill our way out and seize Guiping City. Who can stand to be stifled here?" Feng Yunshan and Yang Xiuqing said, "Of course, we can't delay matters any longer. Now that the grain and supplies have been settled, we just need to wait for the heroes from all sides to be contacted, and then we can rise up in one fell swoop." Hong Xiuquan and Zeng Yuheng nodded in agreement and then said, "Now we can only intensify the training of soldiers and assign Dakai, Rigang, and Chaogui to be responsible, and they must not be negligent."
