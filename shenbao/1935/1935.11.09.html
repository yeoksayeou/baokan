<h3 id="c16">實施憲政之要點 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>六中全會閉幕時。對於憲政之實施。有極懇切之表示。其言曰。「我們耍提高國民共同奮鬥之志趣和願力。非提早實施憲政不可。所以又决定建議五次代表大會。請先將召集國民大會日期。加以决定。以一新國民的觀聽。使我們集中國力的目的。得以充分發揮。」按實施憲政。本爲孫中山先生一生革命之鵠的。而於其手訂之建國大綱中。尤有明確之規定。其後民十八年三月三全大會開會時。又有實施訓政促成憲政之决議案。同年六月中旬開會之三屆二中全會。更有六年訓政期於民國二十四年完成之决議。至民二十一年冬四屆三中全會時。又决定於民國二十四年三月召開國民大會。頒布憲法。以是二十二年春。立法院卽開始制憲之工作迄今易稿六次。發表四次。遂成今日之狀態。故實施憲政。原爲孫中山先生之遺志。亦爲國民政府成立以來一貫之方針。如能如期貫澈其目的。履行其諾言。則在國民黨固足以表示其無上之誠信。卽國民對之。亦將湧現其敬佩愛戴之忱也。</p>
<p>國民黨中樞諸公。對於實施憲政之熱誠與願望。雖已爲世所共見。顧於事實方面。實施憲政之預備工作。去完成之階段固尙遼遠。按照孫中山先生之建國大綱。必須「人民受四權使用之訓練誓行革命之主義。」且已實行選舉縣長縣議員之時。始得謂爲「完全自治之縣。」「凡一省全數之縣皆達完全自治之時。始得選舉省長。」更須至全國過半數之省分。皆達「完全自治」之境。始得召「開國民大會决定憲法而頒布之。」唯訓政六年以來。四權訓練。固尙未開始。而縣長省長民選諾事。亦尙未有所預備。是今日當國諸公雖亟亟於憲政之實施。然事實方面之預備。顯然尙未予以充分之注意也。故我人以爲六中全會建議五全大會决定召開國民大會之日期。固屬重要唯注意事實上之預備。則尤爲重要。蓋就國民黨自民十八年來之種種表示觀之。完成訓政。原不過六年。而三屈二中全會中更有本年三月召開國民大會之决議。然事實上不獨訓政尙未完成卽憲法草案之形態。迄今尙在斟酌時期。可知徒然决定日期而不於預備工作上。予以充分之注意。則决定之後亦必不能如期遵行也。</p>
<p>我人以爲今日黨政諸公所應注意者。乃在設定如何實施憲政之必要步驟。如人民識字運動之推進。四權訓練之實施。皆爲實行憲政必不可少之條件。故與其决定召開國民大會之日期而不能如期召開。實不若先行趕辦此種先决工作。若恐執事者因循怠忽。不能趕速完成此種先决工作。則亦不妨限以日期。但所限日期必須切合事實上的可能性。俾不至再蹈如期不能完成之覆轍。此種預備若有過半數地方之完成。則於其時召開國民大會。實行普遍之憲政。必少許多窒礙。至欲滿足沿海人文發達各地人士之期望。則不妨於此先行開始憲政。蓋中國幅員遼闊民智殊不齊一。上述預備工作之完成。步驟必有先援憲政之開始。大可因地而參差按建國大綱之規定。亦屬如此。想黨政諸公必能考慮及此也。</p>

<h3 id="c71">徐屬的黃水 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 兪慶棠主編　楊汝熊</p>
<p>津浦火車自南京北上，過了徐州，再走剛三站，從車窗向西一望，一泓淸靜的湖水立刻顯現在我們眼前。那便是近來時常在報紙上引起全國人注意的微山湖。它距徐州有五六十里路，是江蘇省西北邊陲唯一的大湖。津浦路上的韓莊大鐵橋，便是架在它和運河滙流的口門上。湖的面積很大，每年湖水漸涸，湖邊有幾百頃肥田出了世，收成頗有可觀。</p>
<p>今年黃河上游水勢盛漲，山東董莊臨濮集黃河决口，水頭由西北直向東南奔放而來，徐屬一帶居民，好似在夢中陡被驚醒，「黃水來了！」喊遍了徐州，喊遍了微山湖邊的鄉下老百姓！</p>
<p>「趕快築堤去！」「趕快打壩去！」靠近湖邊的兩三鄉，首先接到銅山縣政府的緊急命令「，匡匡的鑼聲在各莊上大嚮着，鄉長保甲長督率着全鄉的壯丁，連天連夜的幹築起來！徐州是黃河故道所經的地方，比較年紀大些的人，提到黃水二字，早已全身抖顫！因此，一道緊急命令下來，大家齊心一致的幹起來，踴躍極了！這個堤，便呌做「蘇北大堤」，後來改名爲微湖西堤。」離了原來湖水，約計還有二三里</p>
<p>沛縣和豐縣也接藩幹了，六萬民伕活躍着在微山湖西邊準備和黃水拼命！</p>
<p>那是八月十九號夜裏吧！西北風大作，徵山湖裏狂濤洶湧，波浪翻天，漸漲，漸漲，漸漸漲；新築的沙質土堤，原來是很疏鬆的，怎禁得起猛浪的衝撞？於是，你聽吧！這一段守堤的民伕狂呌了，在堤身上發現了一個過水的洞，幾千人一擁而上，拼命撿堵；一霎那，那一段守堤民伕又呼救起來了，又幾千幾白人馬上集中到那一塊去。水勢愈來愈猛，驚天動地般嘩喇一聲大溜衝過來了，萬馬奔騰的聲浪，和數千萬人的狂呼，響徹數十里以外！</p>
<p>接着藺家壩也守不住了。幾萬策堤守堤的農民心裏着憐了，鬼哭狼嚎。臂挽着臂，水到了頸項，大家慢慢游水逃出澤國，回到自已莊上去。</p>
<p>翻開現在的徐州地圖來看吧！　山湖以南以至徐州北鄉和東鄉那一片原野，已經加上一層灰黃的水的色彩了！</p>
<p>今年徐屬各地的麥季，收成比較還算滿意；滿望秋收再好，那麽今年的年成就算過得去了。又誰知黃水來到，除了早熟的秫秫（就是高梁）收了一點，什麼豆子，花生，紅芋一類的「秋」，完完全全變成海中的水藻和浮萍！可憐的農民，眼巴巴地望着收一點今冬和明春的食糧，現在完全形成泡影了！單以銅山一縣而論，被淹秋禾估値在三百八十萬元以上。</p>
<p>徐北張谷山一帶村莊，盡已浮沉於狂流中，登張谷山一望，四境一片汪洋，竟疑心已置身大海一小島中！據父老相吿：較光緒元年，水還深二尺，水離莊不遠了，有的扛着衣服和被褥，有的拘着小孩，有的牽着黃牛和小驢，有的用驢駝或用牛車拉着糧食，紛紛逃難，絡繹於途·年老的，守着田園，不願出逃，坐在晒塲邊啼哭起來！有的半夜裏堤突然潰决，大溜直奔莊上來，睡夢中爲守堤保安隊十警告的槍聲驚醒，水已到了床下，連忙爬起，奪門而出，便朝牆上，屋頂上，樹梢上爬。那一種悽慘，恐怖，惶急的情况，眞是筆墨靴狀其萬一</p>
<p>中秋，是鄉間家人團聚的佳節，在鄉間這一天是非常熱鬧的。今年，中秋節下午陡然西北風狂吹不已，各處堤壩均吿吃緊，未到半夜，潰决了，潰决了，這聲浪在每一次打來的電話中都可聽到！鄉間老百姓，十個就有八個正在各處堤壩上看守搶險，城裏各鎭各保的人也被挨門挨戶的微調到「黃工」上去，歡樂的中秋佳節，就在這般悽慘冷落，膽顫心驚的情况之下過去。</p>
<p>徵山湖西面的沛縣和豐縣，也早已在和水拚命！還有東面的邳縣，自黃水打微山湖竄出以後，順着不老河，中運河，直向祁縣瀉去，經數萬民夫打壩築堤的奮鬥，終究「人不能勝天（？）」，一再衝潰了兩三道防綫，碩果僅存的只是縣城一方！在隴海鐵路運河車站旁背着中運河的江蘇省立運河鄉村師範學校新校舍，便在如此情勢之下犧牲了！</p>
<p>我們乘隴海車由徐州東去，打大許家站起，到運河站止，車身便好像輪船（不是火車了）一械航行到大海裏·一條畏蛇，在海水中蠕蠕前進，倒是一幅奇異的海景！原來所謂隴海鐵路，這時候有的路身一段已形成攔水壩，有的一段已形成伸出海心的撑浪堤了！</p>
<p>自黃水衝遍了徐州以後，許多村莊都已陸沉，草木，傢俱，犧屍，糞料，棺木等，隨處漂流。農民們顧不得收「秋」不收「秋」，第一逃命要緊！扶老携幼，成羣結隊，向乾地逃奔求生。趕得及把糧食搬出來的，便靠糧食吃飯。趕得及把牛驢牽出來的，便賣牛賣驢過活。有親戚可投的，便可親戚家去借宿。不然的話，只好餐風露宿，搭一個茅棚在鐵路之側，或孤山之巔，以鵠候慈善大家和放振委員的駕臨救命！</p>
<p>有少數人家，本來住在河邊，備有小小木船，黃水來了，他們便大發利市，一方面替人家從被水淹沒了的村落裏向外搬運糧食和傢俱，一方面還在要津地點，實行擺起渡來。滿天耍價，投機取利，比種地賣柴的收入要豐富得多了！</p>
<p>徐屬素稱多匪之區，鄉村治安極不易維持，微山湖一帶爲尤甚．此次水災發生，原來家裏有自衛槍枝的農民，也帶着槍逃亡於外，饑寒交迫，於是「挺而走險」的不乏其人．而道路傳聞，湖匪及小毛賊「趁水打刦」，就連那些已遭水刦的難民，又遇搏刦的已不一而聞了！明年歲首春飢，洽安定是嚴重問題哩！</p>
<p>政府命令開辦災民收容所了，各縣都派了好幾隻船四出尋找災區難民，入所留養。沒有幾天，銅山已收容兩千餘人在雲龍山下，祁縣沛縣也都收容二千多人，豐縣收容一千多人，這幾千人總算暫時有了安身的塲所。最近，銅山縣收容所因爲每天要經費大洋百餘元，無力支持了，把難民資遺回籟，商得隴海津浦兩路同意，用車代爲送回本鄉。一部份已跟車走了；一部份却仍逗留在徐州的東車站，脚蹰不前，要求站長用車送到臨淮關去謀生，原因是田廬宅舍，盡已倒塌黃流中；食糧農具，一些也沒有，不甘因死在鄉中。無家可歸，無路可走，在車站隙地露宿着。囚首垢面，兒童復哭鬧不已，其狀慘極！</p>
<p>天眞會作弄人！一堤之隔，堤那邊水深數尺，雖然到了種麥子的時候，而束手無策；誰知堤道邊雖然黃水未到，可是「老天」已幾個月沒有落雨，沙質的土地，怎禁得起沒有充足的雨水？也是無法種麥。兩般情况一般苦，老農們聚首一塊，莫不疾首蹙額而相吿曰：今秋顆粒未收，今寒二麥未種，明春靑黃不接之際，明夏麥季收穫無望，我們怎麽過？我們怎麽得了？「天啊！」「天啊！」</p>
<p>黃水肆虐於徐州，暫時不再繼長增高；大溜由中運灌入六塘河，於是海州一帶又已成災，此點留待將來再爲報吿，關於徐屬各縣災情，碭山，蕭縣，和睢寗現正鬧早災，而銅山，邳縣，豐縣，和沛縣却相反的在鬧水災。水災結果，據最近的統計報吿如下：（一）受災人數：</p>
<p>銅山　二〇二、八五二人</p>
<p>沛縣　一四四、九六二人</p>

<p>石）（銅山未計在內）</p>
<p>（五）漂沒甡畜</p>
<p>銅山　二、五二九頭（規存三一九七〇頭）</p>
<p>沛縣　三、五四三頭（現存九九四九頭）</p>

<p>邳縣　三、六四九頭（現存四三七〇九頭）</p>
<p>合計　二、九二頭（現存九三二〇六頭）</p>
<p>總計徐屬四縣：「茫茫白水，綜八千方里有餘：待哺嗷嗷，達七十萬人左右!」眞是一個可驚的數目!「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，我們的同胞向來是具有熱烈的同情心的，願　首望望江蘇北部的同胞！</p>

<h3 id="c75">日月星辰怎樣運行及運行結果所發生之現象（一）（十月十八二十一二十七二十八日對全國民衆講） <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 中央研究際天文研究所研究員　陳遵嬀</p>
<p>今天所要講的題目是「日月星辰怎樣運行」但是什麽是日月星辰呢？大家都知道日就是太陽，月就是月亮，除了太陽月亮以外，一切的星，都呌做星辰。這樣分別的理由，不過因爲太陽月亮其他一切星辰都大，並且和我們人類的關係特別密切的原故。這是一般人對於羅列空中光點的觀念，所以「日月星辰」的名詞，也就是一種普通的言語，絕不是一個科學上的術語。</p>
<p>我們按科學的方法說起來，就是以天文學上的術語來說，就不呌做「日月星辰」，而以「天體」三字代表之。就是凡是空間一切的星，都呌做天體。所以以「天體」二字代表各種不同的星，因爲宇宙空間，不止一個太陽（我們肉服所看見的五六千個的空中小光點，或者天文家照相所得的數千萬個的星像，除了極少數的幾個以界，每一個小光點，都是一個太陽，因爲他們距離我們非常的遠，所以我們有過去不能像我們的太陽那樣大），也不止一個月亮（現在已經知道我們太陽系裏頭的月亮一共有二十六個），還有其他不同現像的種柿星體。所以天文家把宇宙裏頭所有的星，分做幾種，至於怎樣的分類，那就是以他們的運行的情形和形狀爲標準，所以我們要知道某一個星怎樣的運行，就可以知道這一個星是屬於那一類了，我們現在就按天體的種類說明他們的運行。</p>
<p>宇宙空間一切的天體，可以分做兩大類。一個呌做太陽系，一個呌做恒星界。什麽呌做太陽系呢？太陽系是以太陽做主人翁，以行星，衛星，彗星，流星，做他們的分子。除了屬於太陽系的天體以外的天體，我們都歸在恒星界裏頭，恒星界自然都是恒星，恒星是什麽呢？就是天空裏開除了太陽系的天體之外；所有其他一切天體彼此間的位置的關係，差不多沒有變動的，這些天體呌做恒星，乃恒久不動的意趣。但是恒星的裏頭又有所謂雙星，變星，星團星雲等名稱，至於去年所發見的武仙座新星，就是新星，那又不過是變星的一種而已。現在我們就把各種天體的運行情形，分別說明之。</p>
<p>我們先就太陽系說，第一就是太陽，上面說過每一恒星都是一個太陽，反過來說，我們的太陽就是幾千萬恒星裏頭的一個，所以他們的位置可以說永久不動，就是說沒有什麽運行。但是各位一定要說我們每天看見太陽從束方出來而向西方下去，難道這不是太陽變化他的位置嗎？不是他亦有運行嗎？其實不然，太陽每天的出沒，並不是太陽　運行，那是地球·自轉的原故，因爲地球每天自轉一次，我們向着太陽的時候，就是白天，背着太陽的時候，就是夜晚，我們看過去好像是太陽的移動，其實太陽沒有運行的。</p>
<p>第二，就楚行星。行星的運行，簡單的說，就是以太陽爲中心，他們繞着太陽四周而迥轉的。就是太陽居於中心不動，每個行星，每年環繞太陽運行一周。地球也是行星的一個，所以我們就以地球環繞太陽運行一周，所需要的時間定爲一年。</p>
<p>我們現在所知道的行星，可以分做大小兩種。大行星一共是九個，按他們距離太陽的遠近說的話，是水星，金星，地球，火星，木星，土星大王皇，海王星和冥十星。這九個大行星，都是繞着太陽周圍而運行的。但是因爲他們和太陽距離不一樣，所以他們運行一周所需要的時間也不同，現在以地球繞太陽周所需要的時間爲一年，即約一百六十五日做　標準，則水星金星比地球更近於太陽所以他們運行一周所需的時間不及一年，就是水星僅約八—八日，金星約一百廿五日。自火星以至於冥土星，和太陽的距離都比地球遠，所以他們運行一周所需要的時間比一年長。就是火星需六百八十七日，約爲二年，木星四千三百卅二日（約十二年），土星約二十九年半，天王星約八十四年，海王星約百六十五年，冥王星距離晨遠，所以需二百四十九年而一周。至於小行星，現在已經確定者共一千二百六十四個，未確定者還有一千個左右。他們的運行樣子，和大行星一樣是以太陽爲中心，環太陽周圍而運行，他們運行的軌道是在於火星和木星軌道之間。</p>
<p>第三，就是衛星。凡以行星爲中心，環繞其周圍而運行的，呌做衛星。衛星是保衛行星的意思。月亮就是地球的衛星。因爲他是以地球爲中心，每月環繞地球而運行一周。所以普通月亮雖然僅指地球的衛星而說，但　天文學上的意義說起來。月亮就是衛星，所以上面說過，月亮不只一個，共有二十六個，但是地球的月亮則只有個。至於其他行星的月亮，例如火星有兩個月亮，木星有九個，土星也有九個，天王星四個，海土星九個。各繞行星的周團而運行，他們的進行狀况，我們可以從望遠鏡裏頭看出來的。其中般顯著的，是木星第一到第四的四個月亮的運行，我們用小遠鏡觀測木星的時候，就可以看見他們周圍有四個小星，那四個小星，就是他的月亮（還有五個太小，小鏡子看不見），有的時候只有見三個，就是因爲另有一個走對木星的背後去了。</p>
<p>行星瓊繞太陽一周所需要的時候，呌做一年，衛星　繞行星一周所需要的時間呌做一月。一年的長短是隨行星和太陽的距離而不同，上面已經說過的。一月的長短則隨衛星和他的行星，距離而不一樣。現在就我們的地球說的話，月亮繞地球一周所需的時間二十七日七時四十三分十一秒。次就木星的月亮談的話最近的月亮，只要一日十八時二十八分三十六秒，就可以　繞木星一周，最遠的則要六百三十六日才可以環繞木星一周。所以木星上面若然有人類的話，他們可以看見九個的月亮，同在一天也可以看見好幾個的月亮，那是多麽好看呢！我們地球上的人類，不幸只有一個月亮，那些風雅才子，每逢滿月尙且吟詩賞月，若然遇到像木土二星的九個月亮，則此出彼落，光怪陸離的現象，必不勝吟賞之煩矣。</p>
<p>以上所說的是行星和衛星，眞正運行的情形。但是我們在地球的上面，不是在太陽的上面，所以我們眼睛所看見行星在天空上運行的狀况，又是另外一種的狀况。天文學上把我們眼看的運行，呌做視運動。醫如太陽本來是不動，但是因爲地球自轉的原因我們覺得太陽每天是東出西沒不斷的運行，這就是我們所看見的太陽運行狀况，並不楚太陽眞正的運行。至於我們從地球上看行星在天空中所運行的狀况，只覺得他們是運行於黃道左右，或者由西向束而行或月由東向西而行。前者呌做順行，後者呌做逆行。從順行改爲逆行或且從逆行改做順行的時候，我們看過去，好像行星沒有變動的樣子，這個時候呌做留，就是不動的意思，譬如今年七月中旬，晚上八九時時候，我們看見西南方面有一個最亮的白色的星，就是木星。在他的西邊一點有一個紅色的星，就是火星。其後他們的距離漸漸的接近，至八月二十八日左右，差不多是在一塊的，以後反而木星在火星的西邊這些時候木星和火星都是順行，就是都是由西向東而行，不過他們的速度不同而已。但是木星在七月十二日以前是由東向西逆行，至十二日留而不動，後再由西向東順行。</p>

<p>招商局於連雲港水陸聯運班船、營業最佳、初時用租船行駛、甚不合算、每一船租金、年費十萬至十一萬元、故總經理劉鴻生特向法國購買一船、衹費七萬餘鎊、連修造亦僅十六七萬元、今已竣工、船員水手早已派定、該輪噸位較專航老窑、尤</p>
<p>爲合算、第一班首航、已定本月十三日、</p>
<p>由滬開出、以後常川行駛、</p>
<p>西北來貨</p>
<p>該局與隴海路辦理水陸聯運後、引起民營公司之注意、大振·合衆·近且合作開行非聯運上海老窑班、謀與競爭、至於西北來貨、究以何貨爲主、年有若干、雖航輪界亦未能確切明瞭、自聯運開航至今、招商局已將上年全年西北聯運來貨、派專員根據艙單、分類彙合、編成統計、其來貨最大宗爲黃荳·花生·麥子·棉花·瓜子·雜糧·與其仙皮毛水菸等雜貨、</p>

<p>按次收費結果影響租界繁榮　特別用戶早已實行此舉無必要</p>
<p>中華工業總聯合會、以上海電話將計次收費、加重工商兩業負担、且有違中國人民習性、爰於本月五日於會員大會召集時、由華商紗廠聯合會提出討論、當塲通過向工部局書面抗議、譯文如次、</p>
<p>驟增負担　影響生產</p>
<p>逕啟者、據敝會上海工廠部份七十四廠之經理函稱、最近上海電話公司、取消用具制度、而將改爲按次計數收費區度、於負担驟然增加、行將直接間接影響生產與營業、請求敝會、據情向貴董事會力爭三塲勿爲公司方面、以片面理由、謠惑觀聽、受此朦蔽、而使一般用戶、俱蒙不利等語前來、所持理由、歸納於下列數點、以備考慮、</p>
<p>租界繁榮　將趨衰落</p>
<p>（一）心理與習慣、對物質上之使用、有絕大關係、緣往昔時日、工商業營業上之設備、與人事往返、不若現在之繁瑣複雜、故時在今日、某於用戶之心理上言、衹須有電話通訊設備、彼此即可有多數營業往來、因此用戶額數增加電話公司卽可保持號數、不致减少、此蓋一半心理作用、而一半亦爲習慣之所使然、今如變更舊制、使一般用戶、均感鱟每打電話一次、將來於次數上、卽須有增加費用之憂、則在用話之時、已早存戒懼之念、其所打次數自必斟酌再三非於萬不得已時、决不通話、時期一久、通話次數、當然减低、至於最後、一公司或用一戶、漸覺無裝置電話之必要、必須出於拆裝電話機器之一途關於此節、敝會會員爲公共租界工商業之營業繁榮上着想、工部局主腦部、當能權衡重輕、勿受電話公司之愚、蓋公用事業之與工商、息息相關、倘今日予工商業以直接之便、即是他日間接予公司以發、達之機、利害有關。出入至巨。如僅爲保證公司資本之利息、所謂在瑞狀下、必須達到某種情況、股東資本保障、方能安全、是誠目光短淺、不識時備、揆其結果、公共租界之繁榮、必將日趨衰落、</p>
<p>壓榨用戶　捐人利已</p>
<p>（二）世界各國各大都市、如倫敦柏林巴黎寺市、均皆按具收費、其所具唯一目的與優點、是爲利便用戶、繁榮市面、簡言之、凡有爲股東經營人等業者、均能依時報吿消息、敏活市塲、金融賴以有充分之週轉、歷久用戶已成習慣、在經營電話事業者、以及一般專家研究電話事業者、亦從未聞收費、其利較諸按具收費爲電話公司所發之書面、揆其用戶方面之利益、毫不注意方面、本身所應負之責任、更一字不提、而確斤斤於計算公司之利益、及如何壓榨用戶、方能得到資本利息之保障、是其利已損人之惡念、可測而知、</p>
<p>請持正義　予以駁斥</p>
<p>總之敝會站立於保障工商之立塲、以負全體會員對外之靑任、認爲以上兩點、均有相當理由、爰在抗議之形式下、提出意見、並請於貴董事會召集開會討論專家報告書之時、力持正義與大體、駁斥上海電話公司之主張、同時並要求貴董事會、轉詢於該公司、在實質上與理由上該公司對於此次變更章程、究負何種責任、並有何種把握、（一）以現在之事實言、租界與華界電話之接綫、已早按次數收費、而記數之錯誤與不準確、不斷發生糾紛、如此次廢棄舊制改用按次收費時、其記數能否保蹬準確、（二）假定此屆變更章程、在公司收入之增加、究有何種把握、又如將來收入、仍屬不能加增時、屆時公司將採何種步驟（三）上海西區接綫尙屬人工、如每次記數不準確、實爲接綫生之錯誤、至用戶對於付費、應負何種責任、</p>
<p>徒起糾紛　政策錯誤</p>
<p>在敝會意見所及、以爲上海電話公司、在今日之情况下、所有特別用戶、如旅館飯店及其他各種之娛樂塲所、均皆一律改按次收費制度、公司方面、在能以加增其收入之利益部份、早經挖掘一空、值此工商業極度不景氣、市面極端衰頹之中、該公司目光所在、不從大處着想、而注重於比較少用竄話之用戶、使其加重負担、似未必能收若何之效果、徒引起社會糾紛、用戶反感、權衡利害、後者爲多、關於此節敝會與會員方面、以及與多數外國僑商、迭次交換意見、咸認爲該公司政策錯誤、變更章制、實非其時、且按次計數、實核與中國人民習慣不合、不能實行、用特提出抗議、卽請考慮、此致上海工部局董事會、</p>

<p>— 婁立齊</p>
<p>楊先生和洪先生在領導我們參觀的時候，還吿訴我們，該廠的產銷情形。</p>
<p>該廠的生產能力，最大量每月能產回力球鞋，萬里鞋，和膠鞋，共六十萬雙。現因市面蕭條，减少產量，月出鞋四十五萬雙，回力球鞋和萬里鞋，月銷各三萬雙，大喜牌膠鞋月銷三萬打。</p>
<p>至於該廠的人事，亦經兩位先生吿訴我們，該廠有男女工人共一千餘名，女工多於男工，工資最多的每月三十多元，最少的十二元，以技術的高下，來决定工資的多少，工人的膳宿，都歸工人自理。惟醫藥費則由廠方負擔，工人的子弟。由廠方設工人子弟學校，實施普通教育，至於女工，在生產前後，得休息三星期，不扣工資，廠方並設哺乳室，以備女工扶育嬰兒。</p>
<p>我們以很短促的時間去參觀比較複雜的橡膠工業，在生產過程方面，當然難免觀察不週。但我們參觀後却有一個戚想，願以獻給橡膠工業者，我們以爲橡膠工業過去的失敗，固由於原料價格飛漲，而生產品因市面蕭條，不能不以廉價脫售的緣故。但橡膠工業者都以製造套鞋球鞋爲它們的事業中心，也不失爲原因之一。因爲製造套鞋球鞋的愈多，則競爭愈烈，競爭的方法，不外改良出品　减低售價，前者不易討好顧客，於是大家就不得不一再削價競爭，以至不能贏利，停工倒閉的時有所聞。所以我們希望橡膠工業者，今後能改變方針，另製他品，例如汽車胎，本來衹有陳嘉庚公司出品，陳氏停業後，國產絕跡，悉由英，美，法，三國輸入，漏巵也不小。現在公路通車的日益增多，須要車胎也日增，深望橡膠工業者能起而自製，杜絕漏巵。（最近方有大中華橡膠廠出品國貨車胎）他如人力車胎，自由車胎，熱水袋，膠帶，玩具，和雨衣等都是橡膠工業中的重要製品。國產尙少，市塲大半爲外貸所奪，也望橡膠工業者能分途在這幾方面，努力生產，推陳出新。打破人爲亦爲的因襲心理，亦未始非自救的一法也。</p>

<p>專家意見</p>

<p>文人韻事，中外所回。卽如日本之文字戲謔，亦有與我國吻合者。茲錄數則於下，以資談助。</p>
<p>日本五山堂詩話云：棲碧東下之日，途經岐蘇。入夜失路，就山中一小家宿。主人欵接相話。旣寢，聽床下有人囁語。審之，皆是山客，行剽竊以爲生者。聽之心悸，終夕不寢，主人亦竟不敢動手。明朝臨去，題詩壁間云：投宿山中三戶村，綠林豪客夜相親：披襟同語君休怪，我亦陳編剽竊人。我邦李涉博士遇盜，盜知其有詩名，索其詞。涉贈之詩云：春雨瀟瀟江上村，綠林豪傑夜知聞：相逢不用相迴避，世上於今半是君。盜喜其詩，果不之奪。日人藻洲子謂，「半」作「多」覺更切於今世。我謂，我亦作「都是」，更近情理，即作者亦白知不免一笑。</p>
<p>棲碧名驥，字德稱，別號詩牛，又曰麻溪，日本讚岐象頭山下人。天生頴悟，生平喜作滑稽語。五山堂詩話又載棲碧事云。棲碧在家，一夕苦吟，妻謂曰：呻吟聲促，何苦如此，殆如我曹免身之時。棲碧笑曰：卿曹免身，腹自有物；我腹中空洞無一物，而强要出奇，自不勝其苦矣。</p>
<p>無媒逕路草蕭蕭，自古雲林遠市朝，公道世間惟白髮，貴人頭上不曾饒。是小杜牧詩，誠哉言也。一夕話載翻案云：近來白髮無公道，偏向愁人頂上催。亦佳。日本故相原一山，自少白髮。是由貴而然耶，抑由愁而然耶？試舉而問我白髮，白髮不答。旣而聽之，若有言曰，乃如一等公，則偏由愁而然。解答之沙，妙在不着邊際。</p>

<p>— 吳毓雋</p>
<p>銀幕藝術。其最重要點，在乎表情的透澈，扮某角，就要把某一個角色的神情舉止，描摹盡致，所謂「面部表情」，「內心表演」，須要兼而有之，始足使觀者心領神會，拍案呌絕。</p>
<p>可是，成功一個電影明星，也頗非易事，因爲喜，怒，哀，樂的種種表情，在一忽兒的工夫，要聽從導演的指揮，就得在面部顯露出來，那就難上加難。</p>
<p>常時，我們同幾個朋友閑譚，甲說：表演戲劇，只有電影最隨便最容易了，不比別種戲的要工架要台步要嗓子，非經習練多時，是出不來塲的，乙說：你以爲演電影容易嗎？那未，現在就請你來試騐，你跟我要在一分鐘內做出極悲哀的神氣，甚且要淚落哭泣的，甲扮了好久，儘是的笑，却一哭也哭不出來，更那裏去要眼淚呢，從這一點上，可見演電影實在也不容易了。</p>
<p>但，我們曉得，電影是片段攝成，然後再聯接起來的，許多地方，也許是從「技巧」方面得來，終還可以藏拙，說這話的也有幾分理由。</p>
<p>這一次，明星公司的四五十位男女明星先後在本市與首都一個個親自登台表演話劇「月兒彎彎」，那才是露骨的表演，平薄視銀幕藝術的這一下便可知道時這輩明星當塲出彩的表演爲何如了。</p>

<p>「那末日本和俄羅斯之間畢竟誰是誰非呢？他們這樣突然的開起仗來，難道也算是正式的國際戰爭嗎？我眞不明白爲什麼這些外國人老是歡喜打仗！儘有許多事情是可以和和平平地解决的，何必一定要互相鬥爭，互相殘殺呢？我瞧它們簡直是天性如此。現在且不管這些，只問日本和俄羅斯今番又是怎樣打起來的呢？」</p>
<p>「因爲日本先起兵攻襲了旅順口」。</p>
<p>「你可是說旅順口嗎？那眞奇怪了！旅順口是我們的海口啊」！</p>
<p>「是的！太后。」</p>
<p>「這是十二分詫異的事！它們旣然要打仗，爲什麼不上日本去打，或是上西伯利亞去打呢？我瞧它們這兩個國家對於我們都有很不好的心思懷着呢」！</p>
<p>「可是，太后，這一次的戰爭委實是和我們不相干的」！</p>
<p>「你敢這樣說嗎？旣然是這一次的戰爭於我們是無涉的，那末爲什麼他們要在旅順口打起仗來呢」？</p>
<p>太后這一句尖利的反問眞使那顢預無用的慶親王無言可對了。其實這一些淺顯的利害，他也未嘗分辨不出，他也知道這一番日本和俄羅斯在旅順口作戰的結果，對於中國必然是有害無益：但他們那些當大臣的都已習慣於萬事不說眞話，能够哄得過的事情便想竭力哄過伊，因此慶親王也故意的說出這種言不從心的假話來了。（四五三）</p>

<p>一　犬的種類很多，全世界共有九十餘種，然而無論那一種犬，各具有特點，就是各有各的用途，實用犬中有守護犬·狩獵犬·軍用犬·警犬·牧羊犬·賽跑犬·牽引犬·等七種·守護犬以英國產的狐犬爲最著，獵犬以西透炮隱得種爲上，軍用犬以德國　　德種爲官，警犬以英國產勃拉特好姆特種爲最敏，他如蘇格蘭的哥利種牧犬，、英國產的克雷杭種賽跑犬，皆爲全世界所聞名的，我們如欲畜犬，應依目的選擇佳種，選擇的方法：第一要種類純粹，明白血統，並調査其兩親的性能，第二在家庭中畜養，以中形犬爲宜，驕小者多爲神經質，碩大者不易管理，第三，性宜溫柔，兇猛的犬，不易訓練，第四選購時以生後二個月爲宜，成長一二歲者，性情習慣，不易改正，第五，購時注意是否健康，先看牠有否皮膚病，再檢牠糞，大概鼻端濕而冷，眼睛澄消，齒亦潔白，耳根陰凉，糞已暗黄，或暗灰色中帶有黄斑，體溫三十八度內外，後肢內側的脈搏，一分間在八十內外，具有一列各種條件，那可算健康的犬了。倘若鼻端乾燥，是患風邪，鼻涕交流，是患呼吸病，眼球充血有淚，齒色黄汚，耳根焦熱，體溫脈搏不正，那是爲病犬。又辨別年齡，門外漢不知道的，普通看牠牙齒生長，就可以判斷出來，査犬齒共有四十二個，其排列的順序，前齒三個，牙齒一個，前　齒四個，臼齒上二下三，計左右上十下十一，乳齒在生後二三星期生長，前齒生後二個月至五個月生長，牙齒四個月至六個月生長，前臼齒臼齒五六側月至七八個月。我們記牢齒的生長樣子，就可推知其年，如齒已全部出齊種類而不同，小形大過了一年，發育完全，中形犬要一年半，大形犬中的馬斯帝夫種，要二年成熟，雌狗的發情期，大抵在春二季，約有半個月光景，雄狗無所謂發情期，平時安靜的雌狗，到了發情期，舉動很亂暴了·普遍當紅潮後五六日爲交尾最適期，過此低减受胎率，交配的雄狗，應選擇血統，純良，切忌雜種，交尾前數小時，雄狗喂以生雞蛋二三個，如一次不受胎，過了兩三星期，雌狗再會發情，如已受胎，過了三日，雌狗就嫌惡雄狗近身，受胎後一個半月，乳房漸漸肥大，普通六十二二日，即可產生，在分娩期前一二日，母犬神經過敏，很感不安樣子，速把狗屋的草藥換新，分娩後，先喂以淸潔的微溫水，再喂以牛乳生雞蛋，切不可去騷擾，小孩很多的家，尤宜儆戒，到了第二日，再換柔軟草藥，草稿用木棍敲得很軟，以免傷害小犬，小狗過了十日內外，就會開眼，分娩後，對於母狗應當特別營養，免得母乳不足</p>

<h3 id="c151">電子學説 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑齡</p>
<p>Electron　theory</p>
<p>根據電子的學說構成物質（matter）的原子（atom　並非不可再分，凡物質的原子，皆由帶陽竄的（positively　charged陽電也稱正電）原核（nucieus）和帶陰電的（negatively　charged陰電也稱負電）的電子所集　而成；電子始爲含在物質內最微小而不可冉分的東西。原核和電子在原子　的排列，恰和「以太陽爲中心以行星在太陽周圍迴轉的太陽系」的情形相似，原核居中心，電子在周轉　轉。一種原子，必有一定數的電子，依一定的規　在原核周轉週轉；各種原子，所含電子數旣不相同，其原核的構造亦各自不同，原核由於帶陽電的陽雷子（protcn）和帶陰電的陰電子（eleetron）所構成，其陽電子數必此陰電子（簡稱電子）數爲多，故原核必帶陽電：廻轉於原核周圍的電子均帶陰電。普通所稱電子，均指陰電子而言，換言之，電子卽爲陰電不可再分的電量。不論含在何原子內，電子和電子都是一樣。依電子學說，一個物體帶陰電，所含電子數必比其未帶電時爲多；反之，一個物體帶陽電，所含電子數必比其未帶電時爲少。故物體收到外來的電子時必帶陰電，反之，物體失去所含的電子時，必帶陽電。尋常物體不帶　，因爲所含原核的陽電恰和周圍迥轉的電子的陰電相等，換言之，即陽電子數恰等於電子數，是故中和。中和的物體，對於其他物體沒有電的引力成斥力存在着，假如某種行爲能破壞　物體的中和，換言之，卽破壞電子和原核的平衡，電子卽有離此物體而去的　　，　的作用因此便可發生。</p>

<p>— 華馨</p>
<p>電流名稱，大衆都曉有，但電流究竟是什麼？根據電子學說，流卽是電子的連續運動，電子從陰極流向陽極，便成電流·尋常一個固體，個如一條銅綫，其原子與原子間是　贛地在互換電子，但其變遷結果等於零，因爲失一電子而得一電子，其結果卽好像電子沒有移動一樣。如果將一條銅綫放在一個電塲內，例如將一條銅綫的兩端接到一個電池的陽陰極上（陽極也　正極陰極也稱負極），如圖一，帶陰電的電子便被推向接到陽極的一端，因爲電子爲陰電所推拒而爲陽電所吸引；是故電子便由陰極流向陽極經電池而回，是爲電流通過此銅綫，電流的大小與導電體（Condutor）（銅綫卽爲一種導電體）的特性及電塲的强弱有密切關係，導體良，阻力小，電塲强，則電流大；導體劣，阻力大，電塲弱，則電流小。</p>
<p>電子是原子裏極微極微不可再分的東西，要是以之來量電流的大小，動輒要以萬累計，實際上極不便當，故通常以安培（anpere）用一做電流的單位。一個千分安培（mili-ampere）爲安培的千分之一；再少些的單位爲兆分安培（micro-ampere）兆分安培爲安培的兆分之一。</p>
<p>1安培＝1000千分安培</p>
<p>1安培＝1000000兆分安培</p>
<p>1千分安培＝1000兆分安培</p>
<p>關於電流的方向這一點，讀者恐怕要有些撲朔離迷。電子說未發明　前，電流方向的定義是由陽極經導電流向陰極，恰和上述由陰極流向陽極相反，這並非矛盾。前者之說，以爲電流是陽電由陽極流向陰極，電的性質的觀念稍異；自電子發明電的性質確　之後，電流纔確定是陰電子的流動。讀者倘認淸電流是電子循　電體由陰極流向陽極，即不致辯別不淸楚。</p>

<p>如上圖所示電池與銅綫接通時，銅綫便有電流流過；如果將銅綫脫離了電池，綫路（circuit）不通，銅綫便沒有電流了，電池所以使電流流通銅綫，因爲電池的兩極間保持着相當電壓，故能使電子由陰極循導電體流向陽極。這電壓便稱爲電動力，電動力的單位爲弗打（volt）尋常生電動力的機械爲發電機（　generator）與電池（cell）兩種。發電機分直流發電機與交流電機，電池也分乾電池（dry　cell），蓄電池，空氣電池，及各種濕電池。普通一個乾電池的電力爲1.5或1.6弗。兩個乾電池接成串聯（inseries），接一個電池的陽極接到另一個電池的陰極，這兩個乾電池串聯的電壓（卽圖AB間的電壓）當爲一個乾電池電壓的兩倍，故有3.0或3.2弗。兩個以上第二圖的電池接成串聯，卽稱爲組電池（battery），普通無綫電收音機所用6弗甲電池（A　battery）卽爲三蓄電池（storage　battey）接成串聯，一個蓄電池有2弗的電壓，乙電池（Bbattery）爲許許多多的電池池的電壓的總和。</p>
<p>第三圖另外有一種組電池，是由許許多多電池接成並聯，卽各電池的陽極接在一處，陰極另接一處，如圖三所示，卽爲三個電池的並聯in　parallel）接法。並聯電池，其電壓（卽圖三AB間的竄壓）與一個電池的電壓相同，不過這並聯的組電池，能供給多量的電流。</p>
<h3 id="c154">導電體與絕緣體 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 恩元</p>
<p>什麼是導電體？什麼是絕緣體？一般說起來，容易傳導電流的物質，便是導電體，其耗阻（resistance）甚少；不容易傳導電流的，便是絕緣體，其耗阻極大。以電子來解。一種物質其電子離開原核比較遠些，很容易由一個原子轉移到另一個原子，卽是說其電子是自由的電子、（free　electrons），很容易流動，這種物質卽稱爲良好導電體，如銅，銀，鋁等金屬便是。電子不大容易由一個原子轉移到另一個原子，我們卽說道導電體育更大的耗阻，如水銀，鐵便此銅銀等的耗阻爲大，便是一例。至於電子，離開原核比較很近，差不多不能够由原子裏逃出來，即是說其電子是束縛的電子（bound　electrons）爲原核所束縛住，這樣的物質，便極不容易傳電，卽叫做絕緣髒（insulator），也叫做非導電體non-conductor），有時也叫做通感體（dielectric）如玻璃，松香，雲母（mica，空氣，火漆，絲綢，毛巾，樹膠，橡皮，甃器，乾木等都是很好的絕緣體。</p>
<p>一個物質的耗阻，與物體的溫度極有關係；有時物體本來是一個絕緣體，因爲溫度升高至很高度竟至變成導電體。尋常金屬導電體的耗阻是隨溫度升高而增大；但液體及炭質體的耗阻恰相反，隨溫度升高而减小。</p>
<h3 id="c155">導電的種類 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 華萌</p>
<p>無綫電應用上除了利用銅綫鋁質等固體物做導電體外，尙有三種導電方式，爲無綫學電所很重視的，卽（一）液體導電，（二）氣體導電，（三）眞空內純粹電子導電尤其以第（三）方式爲最重要。</p>
<p>液體導，試舉一例，如食鹽液（common　salt）的導電。食鹽化學上的名詞氯化鈉（sodium　chloricde），含有氯與鈉兩原素。當食鹽放入水中，變成氯化鈉溶液，食鹽的每個分子都分爲兩都份，一部份爲鈉原子的原核，一　份爲氣原子的原核：這兩部份並非眞正的原子，因爲溶液中的鈉失去一個電子，故帶有陽電，氯多餘一個電子，故帶陰電。這帶陽電的鈉和帶陰電的氯在溶液中並非本來的原子，我們卽叫它們爲陽離子與陰離子（Ions）。假使現在把電池的兩極接到兩個金屬板去，把金屬板放入食鹽溶液內，於是鈵陽離子便被陰極板吸引而流向陰極板，到達陰極板時鈉離子便得到ｇ　個電子而中和，變爲尋常的鈵原子；氯陰離子便被吸向陽極板，把它所多餘的一個電子給與陽極板，氯於是也變成中和的氯原子。這種動作，在電池綫路未斷前，是繼續的，這樣繼續的動作，便是電流通過這液體。這樣的現象，我們卽叫它電液導電（electrolytie　conduction），無綫電應用上如電液整流器（electrolytic　rectifier）便是應用電液導電。</p>
<p>氣體導電，對於無綫電機也有用處，卽如供給晚綫電機的電力，也有用氣體整流器（gaseous　rectifier）。氣體導電的原理與液體導電稍異，氣體內自由流動的電子，因其速度很高，與氣體原子和碰，足以使原子內的電子離原核而逃出，於是自由電子愈碰愈多，若爲陽極所吸引，便成爲電流。例如年紅燈（neon　lamp）（做招牌廣吿的電燈）便是利用這原理，年紅燈泡內裝有兩塊金屬板，並裝滿年紅氣。年紅氣裏除其分子外並有少數自由電子。如將此二金屬板接到電池的兩極，此少數的自由電子便被引向陽極板，因陽極的電塲很大，電子速度也卽很高，此高速度電子與年紅原子相碰，足以使原子裏的電子離原子而出，失去電子的年紅原子便成爲陽離子此陽離子爲陰極所吸，並於陰極得到所需要的電子而中和，仍變爲尋常年紅原子。此種現象，繼續發生，其結果爲電子繼續由陰極流向陽極，是爲電流。年紅燈會發很亮的光。實由於年紅陽離子在陰極附近與自由電子再結合所致。</p>
<p>第三種眞空內純粹電子導電（pureelcrronic　conduction），爲無綫電學上最重要的一個用處，因爲各種無綫電機所用的眞空管（vacuum　lube)卽是應用這個原理，圖五爲最簡單的一個兩極眞空管，管內爲眞空，差不多沒有一些氣體存在着；屛極（plate）也稱陽極爲一金屬片，其接頭應接到乙電池的陽極；絲極（filament）也稱陰極，爲一金屬絲，其一端應接到乙電池的陰極。甲電池爲供給絲極之用，使其灼熱發光，一　平常小電燈然。絲極因灼熱故溫度增高，電子便由絲極射出，是爲熱電子的放射（the，rmionic　electron　emission）。臨近絲極電子最密，離絲極愈遠電子也愈疏絲極射出的電子因屛極爲陽電電塲，便爲屛極所吸收，間也有轉回者，但轉回的電子，復爲悃集於絲　臨近的電子所迫，仍內純粹電子導電向陽極流去。但因爲陽極的電壓頗高，流向陽極電子的速度也很高，足以使少數已經到達陽極的電子爲之折回，不過　回的電子和至達陽極的電子比　起來是少數罷了。這樣由陽極折回子的現象，便稱爲第二次放射（secondary　emission），折回的電子便稱爲第二次放射電子。</p>

<p>凡患傷寒痢疾等症者。其腸壁類皆難受食物渣滓磨擦。故如食不易消化或有渣滓之食物。往往引起腸出血之患。而致病變加重。</p>
<p>此際患者不惟不能食飯。且普通略厚之粥。亦所匪宜。換言之。卽不宜粒米進口。直須飲米湯或極稀薄之粥湯耳。蓋患者旣不易覺餓。儘可禁食。如覺餓者。亦以流質或極易消化之食物爲宜。所謂努力加餐。非其時也。</p>
<p>國人每逢此等患者。常以醬瓜紫薑醬蘿蔔之類供病人佐膳。又極意希望其由粥而飯。殊不知其謬誤百出。貽害於病家甚巨也。幸注意之。</p>

<p>時交冬令。天氣寒冷。百物皆呈收斂之性。故人體如於此時進補。洵屬最宜。</p>
<p>惟補品之選擇。不得不大費週章。一般補品。或偏於膠膩。或失諸燥烈。且效力欠缺。精血腦髓。不能兼顧。就吾人經騐心得。以內分泌製劑「生殖素」爲最上選。良以「生殖素」能促進人體新陳代謝。服入後能使人體分泌作用入於健全。且有補血健腦添精益髓之功。而尤爲一般神經衰弱。病後失調。發育不全。氣血虧損者唯一治補兼顧之良劑。故「生殖素」推爲冬令進補之上選也。</p>

<h3 id="c188">取締樂隊 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 章繼</p>
<p>不久以前，本市某要人參加一家商鋪的揭幕典禮，在行禮的時候，所雇樂隊奏演國歌，輕率無序，頗爲不滿。最近市府復公佈樂隊取締辦法，並令社會局辦理樂隊登記，嚴厲取締未經登記擅自營業及已登記而違反公佈辦法各項規定之樂隊，當局的重視樂隊，由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>音樂不僅對　　有密切的關係，對民族國家社會，尤有極大的影響。我國，對音樂極爲重視，定爲六藝之一，與禮並重·自西樂傅入，我國固有的，便發生很大的變化，這種變化，從音樂的本身上講，是一種進步，但由此變化而陷於過亂，也是不可否認的事實，如今日市上的樂隊，便是一個例子</p>
<p>音樂是一種技術，非有相當條養的人，决不能貿然從事。今日市上的樂隊，他的組織份子，大都是不學無術，或者失業得沒有辦法的人，他們根本不瞧音樂是什麽東西，只要學會幾套時行的小調，便可吹奏起來，目的只在熱鬧，什麽是節奏，在他們根本不瞭解，於是哀樂也可不分，喪喜事同一律，而音樂原有雜持秩序的效能，至此反成了擾亂秩序的東西。尤其在中外觀瞻所在的上海，當行嚴厲取締。</p>
<p>但是筆者又想到今日與樂隊一樣可恥，一樣可惡的小堂名之類，也有加以取締或整理的必要。實在的，今日小堂名之類的組成，與其說是小堂名，無寗說一般無業游民的集合，他們的服裝旣不整齊，行動也沒有規律，擠在莊嚴肅穆的典禮中，眞可說是不倫不類之極，破壞整個典禮的秩序：至於經濟上的損失，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>在厲行新生活的今日，一切不合理的怪現象，應該從速由政府嚴厲取締，尤其是關於禮節方面的，那種不中不西，封建意識與摩登思想雜然紛陳的舉動，應該加以制止。豈祗樂隊而已哉！</p>
<h3 id="c189">船泊硫磺山 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵鳴</p>
<p>曉雲已經發白了，無邊際的海洋，潮水平滑地向了四面溢流着，帶來一陣陣森京的氣息息。天空，孚滿了乾燥的雲　，濃烟以地東面一　，西面一團。</p>
<p>船在濃密的白霧裏，無力地，喘息地在冷冷的海面上蠕動着。昨夜刮了一夜狂風，今晨却完全安靜下來了；海浪也感到疲倦似地，一碰在船身的鋼皮上，便發出呻吟地退避下去，悄悄地。從船頭的鐵欄杆上，望見遠遠的糢糊的水平綫上，一個好像島嶼的黑東西漸漸浮出來。——</p>
<p>這便是有名的硫磺山。</p>
<p>到南洋去過的人，一提到硫磺山就好像是個黑暗的地獄一般，覺得可怕。因爲很久以前中國人跑到南洋去，當船經過這裏的時候，照例要停下來檢査旅客的身體，這叫做「檢身」。如果檢過後被認爲有毛病的人，便囚徒似地永久被關禁在這四面繞着海的小島裏，天天用硫磺水淋浴，薰着惡臭的硫磺烟，而且天天要做長時間的苦工，無數的中國人就這樣地死在這炎熱的硫磺山上了　。……</p>
<p>船駛過了兩座燈塔，慢慢地停泊在硫磺山下的碼頭邊。用很長的鐵皮油管子伸入到深深的艙底艙從，從山的大油池裏，把火油自來水似地灌進艙下的貯油缸去。</p>
<p>太陽已從水平綫下滾出來，廣寥的海面上佈滿了晶亮的顏色。硫磺山的黄泥山，山麓四周的許多銀白色的油池，以及鐵皮屋頂的機器房，都渲染了朝陽暖熱的光輝，好像把整個的硫磺山塗上了一片鮮紅的血色。</p>
<p>海洋仍然靜默地流動着，燈塔兩側的一帶的石堆，漸漸地快被潮水淹沒了。</p>
<p>一個高大的個子，突然從碼頭的踏板上跳進艙裏來，他的後面還跟了十幾個兇蠻的馬來男子，他們的手裏都捏着鐵鎚，手電筒，鐵鑿……他們好像森由裏的餓狠猛虎似地，在船艙裏鑽竄着，艙裏立刻呼喊地喧騷起來。</p>
<p>「開箱！開！開！」命令地咆哮着</p>
<p>「唉，東西不要亂拋呀！」……</p>
<p>「這是什麽？」……</p>
<p>「都是衣裳啊，朋友！」……</p>
<p>在近貨艙口的角落上，一個捲髪的檢查員從婦人的皮箱搜出一　瓶子來，他生氣地把塞子拔掉，捧到鼻子旁嗅了一下：</p>
<p>「嘿，燒酒！」</p>
<p>「不，這是吐血吃的藥酒。」婦人慄慄的聲音嚷着，望着自己的丈夫。</p>
<p>「不行，這是燒酒，禁品！」馬來人難看的樣子看了那男人一眼。</p>
<p>「啊，啊。」男人機警地把鈔票塞到他的手心去：「算了吧，朋友。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>於是，馬來人用粉筆在箱面上畫個×字，便高興地，怱忽地向別的角落裏走去。……</p>
<p>太陽已經高出船頭了，硫磺山的機器廠冒着白烟，烟霧把山頂上的樹木湮沒了。苦力們推着運鐵車的行列，在曲蜿繁雜的鐵道上奔馳，烈日晒在他們汗濕的背脊上。</p>
<p>潮水漲的更高，燈塔下面的一帶石堆，完全沉沒在浪花的下面，波浪不停地往燈塔的石柱上沖洗着。海風也漸漸狂大起來，山上的旗幟拍拍地在煤烟中狂飄着。</p>
<p>船尾的發動機激烈地旋轉了，船，又迫速地離開了孤獨的，黄泥色的硫磺山，繼續向那暖暖的狂嘯着的海洋飄去了。</p>
<h3 id="c190">林中 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>余老頭坐在潮濕的土地上和他的同伴阿楊很吃力拉着木鋸，一來一往地工作着，微微的木屑，雪珠似的，輕飄飄地飄落在他們的赤脚板上，把赤脚板密密地舖蓋起來。</p>
<p>淸早的柚林中，恬靜靜的彷彿深谷里般的落寞，只有木鋸在柚木的身幹上來回的磨着發出來的沙沙的喘息，和斧斤的叮噹的尖銳的聲音。有時間，或有一兩隻小鳥兄，離開了樹林，牠的輕微的拍翼聲，撲撲的劃破了淸晨的靜穆，除此之外，什麼聲浪都沒有了。</p>
<p>余老頭的年紀約莫五十多歲，瘦個子，背脊已有點兒駝了，額上刻印着無數深深的縐紋，這好像刻錄着他的一生的辛苦的痕跡，頭頂的頭髪已禿得變成一片光滑滑的臘臘石。據他自己說，因爲幼年時營養不好，在壯年時候已經脫髪了。因此，同伴們就叫他做余老頭。這稱呼一直順口稱叫下來，而今除了他自已能够知道他的名字之外，一般的同伴們，誰也不曉得他的正名是叫做什麽。</p>
<p>一陣風從樹梢上掠過來，枝葉沙沙的顫　　　　　　　　　　　　的皮　，使余老頭也有點兒感到冷意，遍身浮起疙瘩來，於是，他停下工作，搖蕩着腦袋，嘟噥着：</p>
<p>「現在眞是不中用了！——這一點兒風，就有些兒受不了，唉！……</p>
<p>對面的阿楊，從腰間抽出來一根旱烟管，裝上一口烟絲，嗤嗤地抽着，鼻管里噴出兩條細長的靑烟。</p>
<p>『老頭，你還是回歸「唐山」雲吧，－－這樣的年紀。」他對余老頭是很同情的，他覺得一個上了年紀的人，是不應該在這異邦上流浪，過着「浪帮」式的生活。每當余老頭若有所思喟然興嘆的時候，他總是勸他及早回歸「唐山」去。</p>
<p>「你看，你的身體不是越來越不行嗎？……倘使再過多一個年頭，恐怕連一點工作也都不能做了！」阿楊瞧瞧余老頭沒有回腔，又說。</p>
<p>余老頭依然靜默默地，腦袋低沈，那雙隻深陷的像兩個窟窿的眼睛，緊緊地閉起來了。約莫過了半袋烟的時間，他才睜開了眼睛，憤恨地咀咒着：「死好了！——死，死在番邦倒乾净！」聲音，像一面敲破了的銅鑼。</p>
<p>一提起家，余老頭的心板上頓時就有點不好過，彷彿給毒蛇咬住一口似的疼痛！他不知道是不是年紀老了踏上暮年的悒鬱的心情，還是爲了什麽？那股末來由的思家的熱情，近來却時時繚繞在他的心坎上，很濃厚的。可是，家呢，家已給那滔滔的洪流捲破了！</p>
<p>「余老頭，不要發獃吧，——你瞧，監工那麻皮已從山下來了！」阿楊的聲音把余老頭的思索戳斷了。於是，他無精打采地拿起了木鋸，很吃力的和阿楊在　木的身幹上一來一往沙沙地磨鋸起來，雪上珠似的木屑，輕飄飄的飄落在他們的赤脚板上。</p>
<p>淸晨的山林，像一片恬靜的碧海，乳白色的朝霧，還隱約地在山林間遊行二　　烟，　　　遠近　　　　　　　的單純的音響，此外什麽聲浪都沒有了。</p>
<h3 id="c191">歲暮 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>幾暮，想從府城趕回家去過年，在屈曲和泥滑的山途上給一陣大風雨阻北，於是便閃進山腰的一所破土地廟暫時躱避一下。不久，我聽見了山坡下一陣氣急的噓喘和紊什的脚步聲從遠遠嚮將過來，我詫異地伸出頭一看，原來是一個路過的莊稼人，他年紀約有五十多，戴着一頂破氈帽，全身淋濕地，踏着沉重的脚步趕向土地廟來。</p>
<p>我靜默地向他抬着眼端詳了好一會，於是又低下。廟外的雨聲伴着風鳴在山野里尖聲的呼嘯着。</p>
<p>老人說下透濕破耗帽，輕聲的累語着，又用袖口去揩他額角上的兩漬他似乎很憂鬱，然而却感到憂鬱的不安和愁苦，他柔和的向我笑了笑，接着便用試探的口吻問道：</p>
<p>「客官去城？……」</p>
<p>「不！我是回家去的。」沒等說完我便搶着糾正過來。</p>
<p>老人焦急地用手搔搔頭，又皺皺面，沒等我問下便自己介紹着道：</p>
<p>「而我却是上城去的！客官你說在這樣大冷天還要冒着風雨趕上上三四十里山路，好不叫人苦哩。像你們這樣年紀靑靑的也許不算什麽，上了年紀的我們却就吃力了。……」</p>
<p>沉默了一會，他似乎在等待我進一步問：「爲什麽上城去？」然而我却沒問，於是他便叉自己接着下來：</p>
<p>「你知道我爲什麽要進城嗎？」我搖搖頭。「當然客官你是外地人，沒說怎麽會知道。本來這丟面的事誰還願意老着面孔到處去吿人？但是我又不能不說；因爲它給我的打擊太大了，不說我便要感到心里悒悶悶的，好像梗住一塊什麽東西似的。</p>
<p>樣，　　你將　　　　！上月間的一天，我底大女兒和幾個同伴</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>上山去割點什柴草想放在家里過年。但是整整的去了一天却沒見回來，我正在着急時，却見她底同伴「我們六房三嫂的女兒」氣急敗壞地，滿頭打散着頭髮，全身衣服扯得不成樣子，從山上跑來報說：我底大女兒和兩個同伴一同給土匪綁上洞去了。</p>
<p>「你想這事將叫我怎樣吃驚呢！我底婆子就在當天便嚇倒，」一直到現在沒起過床，而我則流着淚到村長同時又是保衛團團長的老爺家去，他說沒辦法，我只是又回到家里來流淚了。</p>
<p>「於是有一天，我們村里來了一個陌生人，說是要來找我。我便出來見他，他先說了一大篇客套話，又說我底女兒家有信息叫他帶來，便從身上掏出一封信來，我拆開一看原來是一封告急信（別人替她的），說她給土匪綁去，現身禁在山洞裏，飢寒交迫，痛苦萬分，叫我無論賣地賣屋也得替她設法。當時我看着便禁不住眼淚直流，嚎啕痛哭起來，我底婆子也從後房床上爬起，直着喉嚨一聲兒一聲苦的直哭嚷出來，我們便抱在一起哭叫，也不管客人在我們面前等待信息。</p>
<p>「這樣我們便决定無論賣盡當光也得把女兒贖出來。就在當天我便上鎮去，找一家叫元利的錢莊設法，這家錢莊原是和四方八面的土匪都有來往的，當時我向他們說明了來意，并說願拿田產來抵押，他便答應下。大家三面三并議定先交一半錢，交了人後二天再交完。那兒知道在幾天前我底女兒被放出來，它不是一個會說會笑的，而是一個半生不死的連路也走不動的廢人了，你想對這事我能夠甘心嗎？不，我一定上城告狀去，事主我都知道：錢莊老板還有一個是保衛團長老爺的親戚。…」</p>
<p>老人說罷了話，次重的嘆息着便又嗚咽着道，</p>
<p>「不！我一定不能看自家底女兒活受罪！……」</p>
<p>雨滴急遽地打在野樹上，嚮來了清皙的瀟索嚮聲。</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>暑期開學的時候，學校里送來的通知單上比往期多一項十八元的制服費：下面註明單的六元，呢的十二元，要交足後才能上課。陸財富—一個木匠的兒子，他父親根福雖然從燒飯洗尿布的學徒做起，現在爬到一個工頭的地位了，他却不願意自己惟一的兒子再繼續他的飯碗；他以為做工人總是沒出息的：一年到頭穿着短衣服，見了主顧要老爺太太的恭維人家。他想到自己是一個人，老爺也是個人的時候，他的簡單的頭腦中以為這人與那人的區別，就是讀書與不讀書的關係。根福自己從小沒有讀過一天書，現在一張賬單還是懇求人家代寫，接到一封關於生意的信，又要懇求人家代讀，不便還在其次，他想運用一點手段亦因為不識字而使生意减色。但是根福已是四十多歲的人了，做了個工頭，事情又是那樣忙，八十歲學「吹打」他沒有這種雄心了。自然這希望就輕易地放到他兒子身上。他先鄭重地考試兒子，問他願意做木匠，還是讀書將來做老爺。兒子的答覆是要做老爺，這使根福的希望有了着落；他為兒子取了個「財富」的學名，報名入學，現在已是××小學三年級生了。</p>
<p>財富讀書很聰敏，學期終的報告單各科總列入甲乙等，而且學校還有一點石板，毛筆的獎品。根福對於兒子的力圖上進，他的希望仿佛已在眼前了。他每天從工作場所歸家，在昏黃的燈光下把盞獨酌的時候，督促兒子在一邊溫課，什麽算學，自然等等他都不懂，祗有兒子讀敎科書時的朗朗書聲，他滿足地聽着，有時亦搖頭擺腦和着財富的調門。但是父親心里也有一種担憂，就是兒子的費用每學期都增加，學費，書費，他是知道的，以外還有什麽費，什麽捐，常常應付不了。而兒子却是一大篇道理解釋給父親聽：那費用是校里要造圖書館，我們付了這費就能每天到圖書館里看書，那些書本來要買來課外讀的，但是很多很多，買起來要許許多多錢哩。那種捐又是什麽救國的，根福更是聽不懂了。這學期通知單上要她付十八元制服費，雖然經他兒子一邊講述一邊作手勢地說了半天，根福還是想不透學校里到底鬧什麽花樣？他曉得的：讀書是將來做老爺，老爺是穿長袍馬褂的，頭上是瓜皮帽，現在是大禮帽了。現在學校里却做什麽制服，要大家一樣，這算什麽呢？財富的衣服多着，爲了兒子讀書，每季總添一二套漂亮的衣服，穿了制服，不是把那些衣服擱起來嗎？讀書有這末許多以外的費用，根福無論如何想不透的。看看開學近了，這筆制服費根福手頭還有，不過被兒子穿到身上去後，他是沒有辦法彌補這項欵子的。那末，預備兒子做老爺好呢，還是把做老爺的制服費留着？根福委直有些不能决斷了。</p>
<h3 id="c193">橫濱之行 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 李從心</p>
<p>橫濱，像有什麽別緻，總聽見說：到橫濱去玩。但我却未敢有這念頭。這次算是送至友回國，得親親橫濱的容姿，領略異邦的勝地。</p>
<p>東京市和橫濱，簡直我是分別不出兩地的界綫在那裏。可是，開着極快的汽車直駛，要飛馳一個鐘頭。任汽車飛了好多時，我老如舊的，瞥見所經過俱是：青綠的樹木，精巧的木屋，夾着馬路，夾着幽秀的沙土路，一派新綠。到了後半段路，漸近橫濱，地方仍是同一樣的活潑的情調氣色；而更覺曠逸。山堆更多，更起伏秀雅。却沒有殘秋的蕭索的意味。有水，有橋，精神越加瀟灑了。</p>
<p>有人說香港是綠色的城，港島青綠可愛。那麼，橫濱，這島國的海濱城，是尤為清新青綠得如同春葉初露啊！</p>
<p>沿途除了這快感的印象外，最醒人目的是：數不盡的橫濱的：南京街平安樓的中國料理的廣告。日本人的吃很簡單：但中國人便相反，挺講究吃，在異國也仍是更出色此　。橫濱的中國菜是最有名的，東京的中國人，時時就爲了這美味，而特別花了許多時間，和幾塊汽車錢，到這兒來吃一頓的。</p>
<p>可惜到了海關前下車，忙着上船的事，便忘記好好的鑑賞一番。也以為送客回歸，總可以留戀一回吧。但船開客去，日已黃昏了。</p>
<p>安置妥當，與客相對船樓岸上，離別的時候，只差半小時。而天色由淡漸灰，薄暮沉沉，秋風又吹縐海水；五時卽將晚，深深感着秋殘了。不由不泛起幾陣惆悵。</p>
<p>樓船上汽笛疾呼，倍增別意。登與船遙望的屋頂鐵板上，和離人點首。悽然四顧·碧空·青山·綠樹裏的城市·雲·海，一片灰陰凄迷，正是蒼茫日暮時。</p>
<p>秋雲灰暗，晚霞略露微黃色：但瞬間卽消散，變幻多端，濃澹不一。山間青綠已染上蒼老色，隱隱約約，山下樹和木屋，也不可辨，橫濱市已沒入如烟霧的暮色裏，像罩上面紗。</p>
<p>注視大船，三四等處的上船門已關，鐵欄為門，鐵欄上倚着好多個旅客，遙望岸上人，默默不語，不禁有慘肅感懷。旅人！海上浪濤裏的旅程，是困苦的麽？我低低的太息起來了。</p>
<p>最後的一刻，汽笛催得更急。船裏客和岸上人的中間，拉起密密的五光雜色的紙條。但暮風頻吹，飛揚武斷，船正轉身，想把兩方　起的絃似的紙條已紛紛折斷，垂於船側而及水面，紅綠如落花，在黃昏的凄迷灰黯的氣色下，顯得格外憐人。</p>
<p>望着海面，剩下無限的凄凉的寒意。晚風吹得我頻打冷顫。於是迷茫的拖動雙脚，只有歸去了！</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun bid farewell to Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, and others on the morning of the 8th. At 9:00 AM, they flew north on a Junkers aircraft. Dozens of people, including Li and Zou, went to the airport to see them off. Due to bad weather, they planned to stay overnight in Nanchang and continue flying to Beijing on the 9th. No one from the Guangdong Provincial Committee accompanied them. Zou Lu arrived in Hong Kong by late train and said that he would take the "General Pusheng" steamer to Beijing on the afternoon of the 9th to attend the plenary session. This trip of Dai and Ma to Guangdong was very satisfactory. In addition to Zou Lu, Guangdong tentatively appointed Lin Yungkai, Lin Yizhong, Liu Jiwen, and Chen Yaoyuan to attend the plenary session, awaiting Huang Xuchu's arrival in Guangdong to fly to Beijing together. The five representatives from Guangxi are expected to arrive in Guangdong on the 10th and will travel to Hong Kong with the Guangdong representatives to go north on the "President Garland" on the 12th. Chen and Li have canceled their plans to go to Beijing. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun sent a telegram from Guangzhou stating that they departed by plane with the Guangdong Provincial Committee members at 7:00 AM on the 8th and arrived in Nanchang at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. After resting for one night, they will fly to Beijing from Xun at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 9th and arrive at 9:00 AM. Due to the brevity of their telegram, the exact number of accompanying committee members is unknown, but it is reported that Zou Lu, Huang Xuchu, Lin Yizhong, Liu Jiwen, Chen Yaoyuan, and other committee members have already come together. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai and Ma met with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and other Central Committee members staying in Guangdong for four days. The outcome was very satisfactory. On the morning of the 8th, they took a Junkers aircraft with several Central Committee members staying in Guangdong and returned north, arriving in Nanchang around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Due to physical fatigue, they stayed in Nanchang to rest and will fly to Beijing at approximately 7:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, arriving around 9:00 AM. Dai and Ma both telegraphed Nanjing to report. The telegram did not mention how many Central Committee members stayed in Guangdong and came together. Furthermore, Dai and Ma telegraphed President Wang from Guangdong on the 7th, reporting that after arriving in the province, they immediately met with various comrades, conveyed your wishes, and informed them of the illness, all of which were very touching. They wished him peace. The negotiations have now concluded, and they will return as soon as a plane is available. They asked him to take good care of himself. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun arrived in Nanchang by Ford aircraft from Gui at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th and stayed at the Hongdu Guest House. They did not receive any guests and only took a tour of the city. Due to the fatigue of the journey, they went to bed around 7:00 PM and plan to fly to Beijing at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. According to their secretary, Chen Tianxi, the outcome of the negotiations in Guangdong was very satisfactory. The Central Committee members staying in Guangdong have now decided to go north by sea and are expected to arrive in Beijing before the 15th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun completed their official duties in Guangdong. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, they took a Junkers aircraft with their entourage of six people and returned north. Those who went to the airport to see them off included Lin Yungkai, Liu Jiwen, Qu Fangpu, Lin Yizhong, and others, as well as Chen Jitang's representative Zeng Qiang, Li Zongren's representative Zhang Renmin, and dozens of others. The military police authorities dispatched teams to provide protection, and the security was very strict. After Dai and Ma left Guangdong, Zou Lu took a train to Hong Kong at 4:00 PM to await a steamer to go to Beijing to attend the conference. The remaining four committee members will travel north together in the next few days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Dai Jitao and Ma Chaojun have completed their mission here and are scheduled to return to Beijing by plane today. The special plane arrived here from the north last night. According to news circulating among the Chinese, Feng Yuxiang is scheduled to come to Guangzhou before November 10th. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Reuters reporters learned from well-informed sources that the negotiations between Nanjing and Guangdong have been very satisfactory, and cooperation between the Southwest and the Central Government will soon be realized. Dai Jitao and Ma Chaojun returned to Beijing by special plane this morning, and Lin Yungkai, Liu Jiwen, and other important figures from the Southwest will also fly to Beijing in the next few days to participate in the Fifth National Congress. It is now heard that Li Zongren and Chen Jitang will also travel to Beijing together, but this has not yet been confirmed. According to officials here, Chen Jitang will send representatives to Beijing, but if there are urgent matters when the Fifth National Congress opens, Chen can also fly to Beijing.

<h3 id="e16">Key Points for Implementing Constitutional Government <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>-- Tao</p>
<p>At the close of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, there was a very sincere expression regarding the implementation of constitutional government. It stated, "We must enhance the common aspirations and willingness of the people to struggle together. It is imperative to implement constitutional government as early as possible. Therefore, it has been decided to suggest to the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang to first decide on the date of convening the National Assembly, in order to give the people a new vision and hearing, so that our goal of concentrating national strength can be fully realized." The implementation of constitutional government was originally the goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong revolution, and there are clear provisions in the Outline of National Reconstruction that he personally drafted. Later, at the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in March 1929, there was also a resolution on implementing political tutelage to promote constitutional government. At the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in mid-June of the same year, there was a resolution to complete the six-year period of political tutelage in 1935. At the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in the winter of 1932, it was decided to convene the National Assembly in March 1935 to promulgate the Constitution. Therefore, in the spring of 1933, the Legislative Yuan began the work of drafting the Constitution, which has been revised six times, published four times, and has become what it is today. Therefore, the implementation of constitutional government was originally Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and a consistent policy of the National Government since its establishment. If it can achieve its purpose and fulfill its promises as scheduled, it will be enough to show the Kuomintang's supreme sincerity. The people will also show their respect and love for it.</p>
<p>Although the enthusiasm and desire of the senior officials of the Kuomintang for the implementation of constitutional government has been generally seen by the world, in terms of facts, the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutional government is still far from completion. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction, "the people must receive training in the use of the four powers and swear to carry out the principles of the revolution," and only when the election of county magistrates and county councilors has been implemented can it be called a "completely autonomous county." "Only when all the counties in a province have reached complete autonomy can the provincial governor be elected." Furthermore, more than half of the provinces in the country must reach the state of "complete autonomy" before the "National Assembly can be convened to decide on the Constitution and promulgate it." However, in the six years of political tutelage, the training of the four powers has not yet begun, and the promise of popular elections of county magistrates and provincial governors has not yet been prepared. Although the current officials in power are eager to implement constitutional government, they have clearly not paid enough attention to the preparations in terms of facts. Therefore, we believe that the Sixth Plenary Session's suggestion to the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang to decide on the date of convening the National Assembly is important, but paying attention to the preparations in fact is even more important. Judging from the various expressions of the Kuomintang since 1929, the completion of political tutelage was originally only six years, and the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang even had a resolution to convene the National Assembly in March of this year. However, in fact, not only has political tutelage not been completed, but the form of the draft Constitution is still under consideration. It can be seen that merely deciding on a date without paying enough attention to the preparatory work will inevitably lead to the inability to follow through as scheduled after the decision is made.</p>
<p>We believe that what the Party and government officials should pay attention to today is to set the necessary steps for how to implement constitutional government. The promotion of literacy among the people and the implementation of training in the four powers are essential conditions for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, it is better to first expedite such prerequisite work than to decide on a date for convening the National Assembly but not be able to convene it as scheduled. If there is concern that the responsible officials will procrastinate and neglect, and will not be able to complete such prerequisite work quickly, it may be possible to set a deadline, but the deadline must be in line with factual possibilities so as not to repeat the failure to complete it as scheduled. If such preparations are completed in more than half of the localities, then convening the National Assembly and implementing universal constitutional government at that time will have fewer obstacles. As for satisfying the expectations of people in coastal areas with developed cultures, it may be possible to start constitutional government in these areas first. China has a vast territory, and the people's intelligence is very uneven. The completion of the above-mentioned preparatory work will inevitably have different steps. Starting constitutional government first can vary from place to place according to the provisions of the Outline of National Reconstruction. We believe that Party and government officials will be able to consider this.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Completion of the Second Phase of Military Plan: Italian Forces Occupy Magal Town <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Rain, No Resistance Encountered, Lost Territory of More Than 20,000 Square Miles</p>
<p>Asmara The Italian forces occupied Magal this morning. It is located 65 miles southeast of Adwa and is the main objective of the Italian forces attacking in the north. The Italian forces entered the city at 9:00 AM and encountered no resistance. The African chieftain Guxas, who surrendered to Italy before the war, first led his followers and a brigade of Italian forces and a battalion of Italian colonial soldiers into the city. Then, in the name of the Italian king, he appointed himself as the civil administrator of Magal and raised the tricolor flag. At the same time, bomber and fighter planes flew in the sky. Outside the city of Magal, many civilians waved white flags, shouting welcome, expressing their intention not to resist the advancing troops. There were ten people leading sheep and carrying chickens to reward the Italian army, and many clergymen came to welcome them. The Italian commander received them one by one. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Magal General Santini led his troops into Magal today. This town is very small, like Adigrat. General Gasha's residence is the only building. Although the troops were drenched by the rain like drowned chickens, they were in high spirits and ready to continue their advance. They will now be deployed from the Tekeze River and the Kefar River, and the second phase of the military plan has been completed. After that, they will stop for a while to build roads and transport military supplies. As of now, the Italian army has occupied 25,000 square miles of Ashi. There is still heavy rain here from time to time. (National Telegraph on the 8th)</p>
<p>Tigray Province Front Line Our correspondent with the army, Ball, reported that the Italian army entered and occupied the city of Magal at 9:00 AM this morning, encountering no resistance. When the Italian army entered the city, there was one brigade of infantry and a battalion of surrendered General Guxas's troops. The Italian flag was immediately raised on the city's fortress. The fortress was originally the place where the African army fired cannons during the Italian-African War in 1896. Guxas then represented the King of Italy in his capacity as the governor of Tigray Province to formally receive the city of Magal. In addition, the Italian army completely occupied all the military strategic locations outside the city. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) People from the Ministry of Colonies claimed that although the Italian army in East Africa launched a large-scale offensive this time, it did not actually encounter strong resistance from the African army. The reason is that when the Italian army advanced, it adopted a team formation, with each team echoing each other, so as to avoid being ambushed by the Chinese army. When each column advanced, its left flank was protected by the native soldiers in the Donna Caye area, and the right flank was taken over by the Second Army Corps, so it was able to capture the city of Marcaer in one fell swoop. It is currently known that the African army is concentrated in an area 20 kilometers south of the city, preparing to resist. The Italian army plans to use its air force and heavy artillery to repel it. It is learned that the road south of the city of Magar is relatively solid, and it will not be difficult for Italian heavy artillery to reach it. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian mixed-race troops crossed the Cold Ted River on the Northwest Front today and attacked south. The river is the northwestern boundary between Africa and Eritrea. The Italian army took a defensive position here. At the same time, it was heard that the First Army Corps under the command of Italian General Maravigna had completely occupied the Adimbo region of Africa between Aksum and the Setit River. People here believe that these two simultaneous offensives are intended to capture Gondar. The Italian army also plans to encircle the Danping Plateau and the towns of Simin and Massif. These two towns are currently guarded by the troops of African General Seum. If the Italian army wins, it will approach Lake Tana. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>(London) The Italian army is still advancing deep into Abyssinian territory on the northern route without encountering resistance. According to news from Harar, the southern front now has three major Abyssinian army groups. It is expected that a general offensive will be launched against the Italian army soon. One group is composed of the Banno people, also known as the wild hunters, and is advancing along the Juba River towards Dolo. The second group is approaching Wokaden, and the third group is composed of 30,000 members of the famous short-legged Gofa people, currently gathered in Diredawa, all preparing to attack the troops of Italian General Graziani. It is widely believed that the Abyssinian army intends to take the offensive in the south to contain the fierce attack of the Italian army in the north. The Italian army in the north has now occupied 8,000 square miles of land between the Tekeze River and Chefa. The main force of the Italian army occupied positions outside the city of Magale last night and can enter the city at dawn today. (Reuter, 8th)</p>

<p>Abyssinian Capital. The Abyssinian government finally rescinded the order prohibiting news reporters from leaving the Abyssinian capital and the vicinity of Harar. They are now allowed to travel within 200 miles northeast of the Abyssinian capital, but still about 300 miles from the northern front. The Abyssinian capital is currently very active, and it is widely believed that the Abyssinian King will soon personally go to the front to command the battle from a large base camp near Dessie. It is not yet known whether the Abyssinian King will depart by car. In recent weeks, engineers have been working hard to repair the road to Dessie, but according to some sources, the Abyssinian King may depart by plane, as the car journey takes 15 days, while the plane only takes 90 minutes. The Abyssinian King's advisors are all opposed to traveling by car, as the large entourage would be an easy target for Italian aircraft attacks. (Reuter, 8th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. Our special correspondent, O'Chaina, reports that the Abyssinian Emperor will go to Harar Province on Saturday and Sunday for several days, then return to the capital for a trip, and then depart for the front line to supervise the battle. The Crown Prince has now returned to the capital. It is generally believed that during the Emperor's inspection tour, the Crown Prince will administer political affairs. According to semi-official sources, General Seyoum, commander of the Abyssinian army on the Tigray front, has been ordered to adopt a defensive posture and not to attack the Italian army unless strategically necessary, and it is permissible to retreat.

<h3 id="e23">It is Reported That Germany Secretly Expressed to Britain its Request to Recover Former Colonial Territories in East Africa as a Bargaining Chip for Sanctions Against Italy. Britain Is Secretly Active, and Italy Is on High Alert <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The future of the Italian-Abyssinian War is sufficient to affect the overall situation in Europe, but Germany has remained silent until now, without expressing anything. In order to actively promote economic sanctions against Italy, Britain has recently been active in persuading Germany to participate. If Germany does not participate in economic sanctions against Italy, the sanctions will be powerless, and Italy will not be afraid. Hitler secretly indicated to British representatives that if Germany were allowed to recover its former colonial territories in East Africa, Tanganyika, then Germany could accept Britain's proposal and jointly impose economic sanctions on Italy. The Italian authorities were extremely shocked upon hearing this and, in addition to being on high alert, intend to change their original policy of preventing Germany from moving south, and would cede southern Tyrol from Austria to Germany, so that Germany would not be instigated by Britain. Tanganyika has an area of 950,000 square miles and a population of approximately four million. The main products are rubber, sisal, cotton, mica, gold, etc. It was lost due to the Brussels Treaty and is under British mandate. Germany intends to take this opportunity to recover it.

<p>(Berlin) Semi-official sources recently explained the main points of Germany's attitude towards the sanctions issue, stating: (1) prohibiting the transportation of military supplies to the belligerent countries of Italy and Abyssinia; (2) maintaining the current amount of trade with Italy; (3) implementing certain measures to prevent the increase of exports to Italy, which is abnormal. It is generally believed that the last point is the most important. However, one thing must be noted: the amount of coal Germany exports to Italy is twice as much as last year. Regarding this, the government has not taken any measures. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently made a declaration in Hyde Park, stating that he is currently more concerned about the situation in Europe than the situation in the United States, but regarding the international situation, the government does not intend to take any new actions at present. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The member states of the League of Nations are now clearly unable to hope that the United States will quickly prohibit the transportation of iron, steel, oil, and coal to Italy. The government intends to continue to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to Italy and Abyssinia, and only wants to use moral force to curb trade, without wanting to expand the scope of the current Neutrality Act. The government will also encourage the discussion of the shortcomings of the law in the hopes that Congress will pass a permanent Neutrality Act when it convenes in January next year, increasing the President's power to handle matters freely and abolishing the mandatory regulations in the law.

<p>(Geneva) The Brazilian government replied to the League of Nations, stating that Brazil is not a member state of the League of Nations and cannot participate in sanctions against Italy. At the same time, according to news from the Brazilian capital, Italy recently concluded an important trade agreement with Brazil. (Reuter, 8th)</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital. It was rumored that the Brazilian-Italian trade negotiations had been completed, but the government formally denied this, stating that negotiations between the two countries are continuing. The agreement reached yesterday was purely a transaction involving the sale of Brazilian meat to Italy in the past and is unrelated to trade agreements. (Havas, 7th)</p>

However, the French-Italian trade agreement stipulates that trade between the two countries should be based on the principle of balanced imports and exports.

<p>Suspending Liquidation Contracts is Beneficial to Italy. American Kerosene Exports to Italy Are Increasing</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's economic structure is based on a system of vocational groups, making it very convenient to resist economic sanctions. Important domestic products are controlled by various vocational groups or vocational federations, and the executive committees of each group study the supply and distribution of these products on a regular basis, stipulating retail prices. The most important domestic products, such as shoes, mineral oil, medicines, coffee, and milk, are actually absolutely controlled. In addition, the government is currently studying the use of other metals to replace various major metals. For example, the consumption of tin has now been reduced by 50% and replaced with lead. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The suspension of liquidation contracts related to sanctions against Italy by member states of the League of Nations will benefit Italy by more than eight million British pounds, as it is unknown how and when these funds can be recovered from Italy. The Siamese government has ordered nine torpedo boats and two mine-laying ships and paid Italy a huge amount. Because it urgently needs these warships, it has requested exemption from the sanctions measures. (Reuter, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce, the amount of American kerosene shipped to Italy in August and September of this year increased six-fold compared to the same period last year. In addition, the amount of kerosene shipped from New Orleans (Mississippi), Galveston and Sabine (both in Texas) to unknown destinations in August and September of last year was only 666,074 barrels, while in August and September of this year, it has increased to 872,721 barrels.

<p>Osaka. Currently, due to the intensification of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and the gradual retreat of Italian rayon in the Eastern market, the progress of Japanese rayon in India, China, Australia, and other major competitive markets has become significant.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army is currently considering the regular army transfer plan for this December. This is the first regular transfer since Army Minister Kawashima took office. It is noteworthy how Army Minister Kawashima will use his skills to strengthen control within the Ministry. However, Army Minister Kawashima is also extremely cautious about various aspects of the evaluation, intending to devote all his efforts to strengthening control within the Ministry and maintaining the prestige of the army. For the most important personnel, such as army commanders, division commanders, deputy chiefs of staff, directors-general of the education directorate, heads of aviation headquarters, and other central departments, he plans to conduct a considerable range of transfers. He will solicit the opinions of the directors of the personnel bureau and the military affairs bureau at the site of the large-scale maneuvers, and then inquire about the opinions of the General Staff Headquarters.

<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke convened a meeting of representatives of the Tianjin silver and money industries on the 8th to discuss stabilizing the price of copper coins and sealing up silver. Decisions: 1. The silver and money industries will investigate the amount of silver in stock and seal it up, and will not forward it to the capital for the time being to avoid affecting the market. 2. The standard price for copper coins in the market will be determined by the Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Silver and Money Industry Association, using the exchange rate four days ago as the standard. Contact will also be made with the tram company to prevent monopolies. It was also decided to hold another meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th. Representatives from the Grain and Rice Industry Association will also attend to discuss stabilizing the price of rice and flour and prohibiting price increases. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Money Industry Association and other groups have petitioned the Municipal Government to quickly stipulate the exchange rate and enforce price stabilization due to the soaring price of copper coins, which is affecting the people's livelihood, at 400 coins per dollar, to avoid public panic. The reason for the increase in the price of copper coins is that farmers in the four suburban areas do not understand the method of abolishing silver and changing to banknotes, and are hoarding copper coins. Profiteers are also smuggling and profiting from it. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Qian Lu, the accounting director sent by the Central Bank, is investigating the number of banknotes and cash in stock in various money shops. Jiao Piao of the Hefeng Company will be redeemed in legal tender from Weike to Zhongke every day starting on the 8th, and the market is already circulating. (Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Since the government announced the regulations on legal tender, the prices of goods in Quanzhou, such as oil, sugar, flour, etc., have all increased, and sales have been sluggish. Smugglers import sugar and mostly trade in silver. The amount of local sugar produced and shipped to Shanghai in the past month has reached more than 5,000 dan, and each dan has increased by five or six yuan. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) In recent days, various banks have rushed to the Central Bank to exchange silver dollars for legal tender. The Bankers' Association held a meeting today and resolved that the exchange rate for retail sales in the province will be reduced from one yuan per thousand yuan to five jiao, and the exchange rate for outside the province will be one yuan per thousand yuan. All bank drafts will be renamed national currency. The issue of cracking down on embezzlement will be temporarily left to each bank's discretion, as it is feared that the capital of each bank will be insufficient to cope. Due to the rise in silk prices, silkworm farmers in the province have been rushing to the Construction Department to request improved silkworm breeds, reaching 60,000 sheets. The Construction Department has telegraphed the Hangzhou Silkworm and Silk Improvement Association to order 40,000 sheets. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial expert Wei Tingsheng expressed his views on the new currency policy, saying, "I fully agree with the Ministry of Finance's new currency policy. I am even more pleased with the speeches and declarations made by Kong and Song. Last summer, I suggested a plan for controlling currency and finance, advocating the centralization of issuance reserves, unified issuance management, and the establishment of an issuance management committee, with the participation of various issuing banks and representatives of agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and the control of financial undertakings, so that they are rationally distributed in terms of business and region. The Ministry of Finance's new currency policy is almost identical to my original plan, and its decisive move to stop the use of hard coins and the nationalization of silver is a step further than my original plan. This is the best way to manage currency, and it has been adopted by most important countries in modern times. It is beneficial and harmless, and it is not currency expansion, nor is it the same as the exchangeable banknotes issued by ordinary banks that cannot be exchanged. Kong and Song have repeatedly stated that they will never expand the currency due to the cessation of the use of hard coins. I firmly believe that the two men have always been magnanimous and impartial in implementing policies and will be able to stand on an absolutely national welfare-oriented position, vigorously maintain their consistently consistent official statements, and avoid any danger. I also predict that the new currency policy will be followed by a new financial policy, which is the only way to revive the national economy. All of our people should unanimously safeguard it." (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy, it has recently received telegrams from Chen Yi, Song Zheyuan, He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, Shen Honglie, Chen Jicheng, Han Fuju, the Guizhou Provincial Government, and the Chambers of Commerce of Shanghai and Hankou, expressing their determination to earnestly comply. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang and Kong telegraphed the provincial, municipal, military, and political authorities on the 8th, ordering them to swiftly take effective measures to deal with profiteers who raise prices and disrupt finance. 12 million in silver has been sealed up in Hankou. The Central, Communications, and China Banks shipped 10 million in legal tender to Hankou on the 8th, including 1 million in subsidiary coins, divided into 2 jiao, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao denominations. The Silver Association resolved to waive the premium on inter-port remittances, waive the handling fee for remittances to Shanghai, and charge a small handling fee for mutual remittances in various places. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The banks here reopened this morning, but only for a short time, before closing again, because they were unable to clearly understand the Guangdong Provincial Government's currency order. Representatives of the Bankers' Association are currently meeting with the Director of the Finance Department to discuss and study the provisions of the order regarding the repayment of depositors, etc. The market situation is still uncertain, and prices have risen by about 20%. The authorities here are currently promoting the plan for nationalizing silver. The Issuance Reserve Management Committee will be established within a week, and will be organized by 15 government representatives and 19 representatives from financial, commercial, and other groups. Armed troops are stationed in various places here and near Shamian to prevent the outflow of silver. (Reuter, 8th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Well-informed sources estimate that 2,500 boxes of silver worth 1.25 million British pounds will be shipped out tomorrow on the vessel Soromoli, mostly owned by British commercial banks here. It is also heard that British commercial banks here have ordered a batch of wooden boxes and require them to be delivered by a certain date, which proves that a large amount of silver is still being shipped out of Hong Kong within days. It is expected that the Hong Kong government will issue a public announcement on the currency issue at the end of this week, because the day after next week is a bank holiday, so speculators cannot take the opportunity to profit. It is rumored that the Hong Kong dollar will be fixed at a price of one shilling and three pence, or one shilling and four pence, or one shilling and pence. Most believe that one shilling and five pence is closer, but the fixed price of the Hong Kong dollar may be a temporary plan, as it must wait for further study of the central government's currency system plan and understand all its aspects before a proper method can be determined.

<p>(Kaifeng) On the 8th, many people held cash to exchange for legal tender at the Central, Communications, and China Banks, totaling 3,000 yuan. The currency price has rebounded from 7,600 to 8,000. Food prices have stabilized. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles have learned that after the Ministry of Finance implemented the emergency decree on currency management, the British Ambassador first instructed British commercial banks to comply with the exchange of legal tender. Other countries with banks or close commercial relations in China have also sent telegrams to their governments through their ministers, requesting instructions, and will implement them separately upon receiving instructions. According to investigations, the foreign banks that issue banknotes in our country include HSBC, Citibank, Mercantile Bank, and Yokohama Specie Bank. HSBC once reached a maximum issuance amount of 60 million yuan in the past, but now only a few hundred thousand are in circulation, so there is not much problem with recalling the issuance, and it has no impact on foreign commercial banks.

<p>(London) Financial circles here believe that the future of the silver market depends on how the Chinese government handles the reserve funds deposited in the central bank and the attitude of the United States. The US silver policy will still be a factor in determining the price of silver. The "Financial Times" believes that the United States will not change its silver policy, especially as the US general election is approaching, and the government will not change its silver policy to lose the favor of voters. (Havas, 7th) The "Wall Street Journal" of New York has many negative comments on China's silver nationalization policy. According to the newspaper, China will use silver as a currency reserve, and the central bank will be the standard for the value of Chinese currency to the outside world. The newspaper commented on the matter, saying that since China has now fixed the British exchange rate at one shilling and two and a half pence, the influence of the British pound in the Far East will become more consolidated. This exchange rate proves that the Shanghai exchange rate will eventually decrease to the price of the Japanese yen, which is one shilling and two pence. (National, 7th)</p>

<p>Silver Policy Certainly Increases Severity of China's Economic Situation; Main Proposal is to Establish Agency in China to Handle Installment Sales of American Goods</p>
<p>(New York) The report of the U.S. Far East Economic Mission, long awaited by the general public, was finally released today. It states that the United States' silver purchasing policy has indeed increased the severity of China's economic situation. However, the collapse of the Shanghai real estate industry is unrelated to this policy. The mission's most important recommendation is that the United States find a way to establish an agency in China with the authority to provide long-term credit to Chinese who purchase American goods. Furthermore, in order to increase China's exports, the United States should purchase large quantities of pig iron in China. It also stated that the U.S. silver purchasing policy was expected to have good effects, but in reality, it had the opposite effect. However, the slump in Shanghai's real estate industry was caused by excessive construction and foolish speculation, and cannot be blamed on the silver purchasing policy. The report also cited a memorandum issued to the mission by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, which also stated that China's economic decline was entirely due to external forces affecting the livelihood of the Chinese people, the most notable being the decline in purchasing power. The currency policies of other countries have caused the value of Chinese silver coins to increase, resulting in increasingly dangerous economic difficulties for China. The report also advocated the establishment of an agency in China to compete commercially with other countries, and stated that countries such as Britain and Italy are using Boxer Indemnity funds as a foundation to sell building, factory, shipbuilding and railway materials. Therefore, the United States should also find ways to promote long-term lending. As for the methods of this lending, the mission could not suggest a specific approach, but advocated that there should be the following three points: (1) U.S. capital should have a controlled mechanism with the authority to guarantee that this capital will not be diverted to other uses, (2) if it is a construction project, it should be supervised by Americans to ensure the standards of the building, (3) Americans should participate in management to ensure efficiency and full repayment of American funds. The report also stated that China has very rich iron ore deposits, so it strongly recommends that the United States contact China to cooperate as much as possible in the extraction, transportation and sales. After success, both countries can benefit greatly. (7th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>All Countries Will Surely Support China's Currency System Policy</p>
<p>American Cambridge. China's opposition to extraterritoriality was once again raised today by Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji in a speech at the East Asian Association here. Shi quoted experts as saying that extraterritoriality damages the dignity of civilized great powers and hinders China's development of unlimited commercial traffic in the interior. Since the implementation of extraterritoriality, Chinese plaintiffs have often been unable to obtain fair judgments, nor can they restrain the actions of foreigners, because foreign laws are not suitable for local conditions. Shi also stated that although some say that extraterritoriality can cause anti-foreign sentiment, this kind of sentiment is not directed at the United States. Since foreigners are not bound by local laws, China cannot allow foreigners to have the right to reside, inherit property, and do business in the interior. (7th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Boston. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji hosted a banquet for Boston Mayor Mansfield this afternoon, and in his speech, he said that he firmly believes that all countries can support the Chinese government's nationalization of silver and currency stabilization policies. Shi also said that since 1911, China has changed from an autocratic system to a republic, and fundamental changes have also taken place in social, commercial, and cultural life within weeks, resulting in extremely big problems. However, the spirit and perseverance of the Chinese people have solved these difficulties one by one. The recent currency policy is an effort to stop economic decline, which is not only beneficial to China itself, but all countries that have commercial relations with China will benefit from it, and it is completely in line with the efforts of other countries to seek recovery and prosperity. The Chinese government firmly believes that this move can stabilize currency prices, prevent drastic changes in exchange rates, and prevent it from hindering trade with China, so a major obstacle to international trade has also been removed, so it is natural for friendly countries to support it.

<p>(Nanjing) The bullet that hit President Wang's cheek had the bone fragments and shrapnel removed on the 1st, but because of the swelling of the face, the bullet was not removed. Now, after a week of treatment, the swelling has subsided by 80-90%. It was discovered that the bullet had moved upward and was close to the temple. On the morning of the 8th, it was decided to perform surgery. At 11:00 a.m., Shen Kefei led his assistants to prepare the operating room and moved Wang in. First, an X-ray was taken, and then local anesthesia was administered. Shen then used swift and exquisite surgery to remove the bullet from behind the temple, sutured it, and covered it with ice and medicine. The time was no more than five minutes. From the time Wang entered the room until he left, it was only 15 minutes. Wang felt quite good after the surgery and had no pain. When Wang returned to the ward, he had to pass Zhang Jingjiang's Ward No. 278. A sign was posted at the door saying "No Visitors." Wang turned his head to Mrs. Wang and asked, "Is this Mr. Zhang's pain room?" This shows that he was clear-headed and had no pain. After Wang returned to the ward, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Shuren, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, and others entered the ward to express their condolences and chatted briefly. At 12:00 p.m., Wang ate a bowl of rice porridge, milk, and chicken broth, and his appetite was better than before. The swelling of his face had also completely subsided. His body temperature was 37 degrees, his pulse was 84 beats per minute, and his respiration was 16 breaths per minute, which was the same as a normal person. As for the bullet in his back ribs, it was embedded between the two ribs and was irrelevant, so it was decided not to remove it. Now, the stitches on his back have also been removed. According to Chen Shuren, Wang's injuries, under these circumstances, can be completely recovered within ten days. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>—Civilian in Name, Military in Reality—</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: Dalian City is the foremost gateway to the Northeast by both land and sea. In terms of aviation, it can also be called the foremost gateway. Therefore, the Japanese Postal Bureau has recently been diligently working to construct this first aviation gateway's airfield, hoping to achieve complete and flawless facilities for the air force. Since the spring of this year, they have been working to renovate the Zhoushuizi airfield, expanding it to the largest scale. A phase is expected to be completed within this year, realizing a state-of-the-art aviation landing field. This renovation, on the surface, emphasizes passenger convenience. In front of the existing hangars, a very convenient road is being built, allowing passage in all weather conditions. Takeoff and landing positions are being demarcated, and welcoming and sending areas, mail receiving points, and mail sorting offices are being established. The six-meter-wide road for automobiles and the automobile parking area are being built. Furthermore, the new construction for the Postal Bureau, the airfield office, the Manchuria Aviation Company, the radio room, and the weather station are planned for next year. Within the airfield, three runways, each sixty meters wide and six hundred meters long, are being laid. After the entire project is completed, it will become a large airfield with a total area of 450,000 "ping" (approximately 330 acres). Once fully completed next year, they claim, it could be considered the largest airfield in the Orient.</p>

<p>The Central Bank Convenes a Meeting of Banks and Money Houses to Orderly Report the Amount of Notes and Silver in Storage by a Deadline</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Central Government announced the monetary policy, the Central Bank of this city immediately received orders from the head office. On the 4th, a meeting of the Banking Association was specifically convened, and it was resolved to make efforts to comply. On the 6th, Central Bank Director Ma Duo, Bank of China Director Chen Junren, and Bank of Communications Director Lu Tingxuan went together to visit Finance Director Wang Xiangrong to report on the handling situation. At 10:00 AM, the Central Bank convened another meeting of all banks and money houses in the city at the Banking Association (Bank of Communications), setting a deadline for reporting the amount of notes and silver in storage. More than seventy people attended. After the meeting began, Chairman Ma Duo reported, in brief, stating that he had called everyone here today to report matters and ask for everyone's help. The matters being reported were probably seen in the newspapers. The Ministry of Finance issued an order on the 3rd of this month, stating that cash would no longer be used from that day forward, and that notes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks were designated as legal tender. Those with cash could exchange it for legal tender. Notes from other banks, once approved, would still be allowed to circulate. After the announcement that coins were no longer to be used, they could no longer be stored or used, or else they would be punished. The most important intention of the Central Government's resolute announcement and implementation of the monetary policy was to prevent the outflow of silver, because during the two months in which silver was purchased from the United States, two hundred million yuan of silver flowed out of China. Later, the government implemented a balancing tax to limit the outflow, which had some effect, but not for foreign merchants, because they could concentrate silver at any time and take the opportunity to transport it out. Therefore, for practical needs, the government announced the implementation of the monetary policy: (1) to thoroughly prevent the outflow of silver; (2) to address the bankruptcy of rural areas and call for relief, the government had studied with Chinese and foreign economic experts, who all believed that there was no other way; (3) in international exchange rates, the government also took this into consideration, so it also ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to buy and sell foreign exchange as much as possible. The results have been very good since this method was implemented for two days. Foreign banks are also using silver to exchange for legal tender. Even if there are a few who obstruct it, it is not important. It is hoped that this matter will be promoted smoothly. As for this city, because some people have been smuggling silver out of the country in the past two months, the Department of Finance and various banks have stipulated joint and several redemption methods, and silver has not been going out for a long time. The method of the Department of Finance has already been implemented in this province. Now that the central government's order has been issued, there is even more security. He then convened a meeting of various banks to stipulate three measures: 1. The industry will implement flat exchange rates and settle accounts with each other in Shanghai; 2. Outlets will waive remittance fees for remittances, only charging a postal and telecommunications handling fee of one yuan per thousand yuan; 3. Restrictions will also be strictly enforced on dialing codes in this city, and banks will no longer accept them. One more point: fellow silver businesses can exchange silver for legal tender to avoid the impact of shortage of funds. Today, I hope that everyone will thoroughly understand and follow this policy. Today, the three banks also reported the handling process to the Department of Finance. I hope that you will check the notes and silver in storage and report them in detail to the Central Bank tonight, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned, and the various banks and money houses immediately prepared to check their storage and report. The Central Bank's branch in this city received a telegram from the head office stating, "The Ministry of Finance has issued a letter stating that the notes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks have been designated as legal tender, which has been announced. All banks and money houses outside of Shanghai, up to November 3, must ascertain the types and amounts of notes and the amounts of cash in storage, whether the bank or house owns them or is holding them on behalf of others. Except for places where there is a Central Bank, the Central Bank should be responsible for convening the local silver industry to quickly report to the Central Bank for reporting to the headquarters. In places where there is no Central Bank, the China and Communications Banks should be responsible for convening the joint management and forwarding the report to the headquarters for verification. In addition to the branch office, a letter is sent to the branch offices in various places to notify the local silver industry to comply with the instructions, etc. This is approved, in addition to the Ministry sending another telegram to the local government offices, it is appropriate to telegraph to follow up and report as required by the head office branch," (6th)</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Yellow Waters of the Xuzhou Region <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qing-tang, Written by Yang Ru-xiong</p>
<p>The Jinpu Railway, heading north from Nanjing, after passing Xuzhou, and going just three more stations, looking west from the train window, a tranquil lake immediately appears before our eyes. That is Weishan Lake, which has recently been attracting national attention in the newspapers. It is located fifty to sixty "li" (approximately 17-20 miles) from Xuzhou and is the only large lake on the northwestern border of Jiangsu Province. The Hanzhuang Grand Iron Bridge on the Jinpu Railway is built at the confluence of the lake and the Grand Canal. The area of the lake is very large. Every year as the lake water gradually dries up, hundreds of "qing" (approximately 16 acres) of fertile land on the lake's edge emerge, yielding a considerable harvest.</p>
<p>This year, the water flow in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was exceptionally strong. The Yellow River breached at Dongzhuang and Linpu Collection in Shandong, and the water surged from the northwest directly southeast. Residents in the Xuzhou region were suddenly awakened as if from a dream. "The Yellow Water is coming!" The cry spread throughout Xuzhou and the rural villages along the edge of Weishan Lake!</p>
<p>"Hurry and build dikes!" "Hurry and build dams!" The two or three townships closest to the lake were the first to receive the emergency order from the Tongshan County government. The "kuang kuang" sound of gongs echoed loudly in each village. The township chiefs and "baojia" leaders supervised the able-bodied men of the entire township, working day and night to build. Xuzhou is a place through which the old course of the Yellow River passes. Those who are older tremble at the mention of the words "Yellow Water"! Therefore, when an emergency order was issued, everyone worked together with one heart and one mind, extremely enthusiastically! This dike was called the "Northern Jiangsu Grand Dike," later renamed the "Weihu West Dike." It was about two or three "li" away from the original lake water.</p>
<p>Peixian and Fengxian also followed suit, with 60,000 laborers actively preparing on the west side of Weishan Lake to fight the Yellow Water!</p>
<p>It was the night of August 19th, right? The northwest wind blew strongly, and the waves in Weishan Lake surged, rising higher and higher. The newly built sandy soil dike was originally very loose. How could it withstand the violent waves? And so, listen! The dike-guarding laborers on this section cried out wildly, discovering a hole in the dike where water was passing through. Thousands of people rushed forward to block it desperately. In an instant, the dike-guarding laborers on that section cried for help again, and thousands upon thousands of people immediately concentrated on that area. The water became more and more fierce. With an earth-shattering crash, a huge torrent rushed over, and the sound of ten thousand galloping horses, along with the shouts of tens of millions of people, echoed for tens of "li"!</p>
<p>Then Linjiaba could not be held either. Tens of thousands of peasants guarding the dikes were filled with pity, wailing like ghosts. Arm in arm, with the water up to their necks, everyone slowly swam out of the watery land, returning to their own villages.</p>
<p>Open the current map of Xuzhou and look! The wilderness south of Weishan Lake all the way to the northern and eastern townships of Xuzhou has been covered with a layer of grayish-yellow water!</p>
<p>This year, the harvest during the wheat season in various places in the Xuzhou region was relatively satisfactory. Everyone hoped that the autumn harvest would be good, so that this year could be considered passable. But who knew that the Yellow Water would come? Except for a little early-maturing sorghum (gaoliang) that was harvested, all the beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other "autumn" crops were completely transformed into seaweed and duckweed in the water! The poor farmers were looking forward to harvesting a little food for this winter and next spring, but now it has completely become a pipe dream! Taking Tongshan County alone, the value of autumn crops submerged is estimated at over 3.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Villages in the Zhanggushan area north of Xuzhou have all sunk into the raging torrent. Climbing Zhanggushan and looking around, the surrounding area is a vast expanse of water, making one suspect that one is on a small island in the sea! According to the elders, the water is two "chi" (approximately 2 feet) deeper than in the first year of the Guangxu reign. The water is not far from the village. Some carried clothes and bedding, some held children, some led yellow cattle and small donkeys, and some used donkeys or ox carts to haul grain, fleeing in droves along the road. The elderly, guarding their fields, unwilling to flee, sat by the threshing floor and cried! Some, in the middle of the night, the dike suddenly collapsed, and the torrent rushed straight into the village. They were awakened from their sleep by the warning shots of the dike-guarding security team. The water had already reached under the bed. They quickly got up, rushed out the door, and climbed onto the walls, rooftops, and treetops. The misery, terror, and panic of that situation are truly beyond description.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is a joyous time for family reunions in the countryside, and it is very lively on this day. This year, on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the northwest wind suddenly blew violently. The dikes and dams everywhere were under extreme pressure. Before midnight, they collapsed, they collapsed! This sound could be heard in every phone call that came in! Eight out of ten villagers were watching over and rushing to repair the dikes everywhere. People from towns and villages in the city were also levied door-to-door to go to the "Yellow Works." The joyous Mid-Autumn Festival passed under such a miserable, desolate, and frightened situation.</p>
<p>Peixian and Fengxian on the west side of Weishan Lake had also long been fighting the water desperately! And Picheng to the east, after the Yellow Water broke out of Weishan Lake, followed the Bulao River and the Central Canal, flowing straight towards Picheng. After the efforts of tens of thousands of laborers to build dams and dikes, ultimately "man cannot conquer heaven (?!)," and two or three defense lines were breached repeatedly. The only thing that remained was the county seat! The new campus of the Jiangsu Provincial Canal Rural Normal School, located next to the Grand Canal at the Yunhe Station on the Longhai Railway, was sacrificed under such circumstances!</p>
<p>Taking the Longhai train east from Xuzhou, from Daxujia Station to Yunhe Station, the train body seemed like a ship (not a train anymore) sailing in the sea. A venomous snake wriggled forward in the sea, creating a strange seascape! The so-called Longhai Railway, at this time, some sections of the roadbed had become water barriers, and some sections had become wave-bracing dikes extending into the sea!</p>
<p>Since the Yellow Water swept through Xuzhou, many villages have sunk, with grass, trees, furniture, sacrificial objects, manure, coffins, etc., floating everywhere. The farmers could not care less about harvesting the "autumn" crops. The first priority was to escape for their lives! Supporting the old and carrying the young, they fled in groups to high ground for survival. Those who managed to move their grain out relied on the grain for food. Those who managed to lead their cattle and donkeys out sold them to make a living. Those who had relatives to turn to could borrow lodging from their relatives. Otherwise, they had to live exposed to the wind and dew, building a thatched shed next to the railway or on the top of a lonely mountain, waiting for the arrival of charitable people and relief committee members to save their lives!</p>
<p>A few families, who originally lived by the river and had small wooden boats, made a fortune when the Yellow Water came. On the one hand, they helped people transport grain and furniture from the flooded villages. On the other hand, they set up ferries at key locations. They overcharged, speculating and profiting, making much more than they would by farming or selling firewood!</p>
<p>The Xuzhou region has always been known as an area with many bandits, and maintaining rural security is extremely difficult, especially in the Weishan Lake area. This time, after the flood occurred, farmers who originally had self-defense guns at home also took their guns and fled. Overcome by hunger and cold, there were many who "took risks." And rumors spread that lake bandits and petty thieves were "taking advantage of the flood to rob," and it was not uncommon to hear that even the refugees who had already suffered water robbery were being robbed again! Next year, at the beginning of the year, during the spring famine, maintaining stability will be a serious issue!</p>
<p>The government has ordered the establishment of disaster relief shelters, and each county has sent several boats to search for refugees in the disaster areas and take them in for shelter. Within a few days, Tongshan had taken in more than 2,000 people under Yunlong Mountain, and Picheng and Peixian had also taken in more than 2,000 people each, and Fengxian had taken in more than 1,000 people. These thousands of people have finally found a temporary place to stay. Recently, the Tongshan County shelter, because it cost more than 100 silver dollars every day, was unable to support it, and sent the refugees back to their hometowns, having negotiated with the Longhai and Jinpu railways to use trains to send them back to their hometowns. Some have already left by train, but some are still lingering at the east station of Xuzhou, hesitating, asking the stationmaster to use the train to send them to Linhuai Pass to make a living, because their fields and houses have all collapsed into the Yellow River, and they have no food or farming tools. They are unwilling to starve to death in their hometowns. With no home to return to and no way to go, they are sleeping rough on the open ground at the station. With disheveled hair and dirty faces, the children are crying endlessly, their condition is extremely miserable!</p>
<p>Heaven truly plays tricks on people! On one side of the dike, the water is several "chi" deep. Although it is time to plant wheat, there is nothing to be done. Who knew that although the Yellow Water had not reached the side of the dike, "Heaven" had not rained for several months, and the sandy soil could not withstand the lack of sufficient rain? It was also impossible to plant wheat. With both situations equally difficult, the old farmers gathered together, all sighing and frowning, telling each other: this autumn, no grain was harvested, and this winter, no wheat was planted. When spring comes and the old crop runs out, and there is no hope of harvesting wheat next summer, how will we survive? How will we get through this? "Heaven! Ah, Heaven!"</p>
<p>The Yellow Water is raging in Xuzhou, temporarily no longer continuing to rise; the torrent flows from the Central Canal into the Liutang River, so the Haizhou area has again become a disaster area. This point will be reported later. Regarding the disaster situation in the various counties of Xuzhou, Dangshan, Xiaoxian, and Suining are currently experiencing drought, while Tongshan, Picheng, Fengxian, and Peixian, on the contrary, are experiencing floods. The results of the flood, according to the latest statistical report, are as follows: (1) Number of people affected by the disaster:</p>
<p>Tongshan 202,852 people</p>
<p>Peixian 144,962 people</p>

<p>Picheng 3,649 heads (43,709 heads still exist)</p>
<p>Total 2,92 heads (93,206 heads still exist)</p>
<p>In total, the four counties of Xuzhou: "Vast white water, covering more than 8,000 square "li"; awaiting feeding, nearly 700,000 people!" Truly an alarming number! "A heart of compassion, everyone has it." Our compatriots have always possessed a warm sense of sympathy. May [our leaders] look to our compatriots in northern Jiangsu!</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Case of Liu, the Governor of Leizhou: Li Zhen's Confirmed Confession <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>—Inconsistent with Japanese Newspapers—</p>
<p>Beijing News: Recently, Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Shanghai published the confession of Li Zhenhua, the perpetrator in the assassination of Liu Zuozhou in Leizhou, which implicated the Beiping Military Affairs Branch. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with a certain authority in Beijing. The responsible person of the authority stated that the suspect had been interrogated by Yin Rugeng, the special commissioner of the Leiyu District, and a record of the suspect's confession from August 28th of this year had been sent to Beijing. At that time, there were plans to publish this confession to clarify the truth. However, as the accomplices mentioned in the confession had not yet been apprehended, it was feared that it would hinder the investigation. Furthermore, the confession implicated Japanese military institutions and figures like Shi Yousan, which would only increase disputes. Therefore, secrecy was maintained. Now that Japanese newspapers have published the information, our side can no longer remain silent, lest we be unjustly slandered. Thereupon, they produced the full text of the suspect's confession, which is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Confession of Li Zhenhua at 9:00 AM on August 28th:</p>
<p>Question: Name, age, and native place?</p>
<p>Answer: Li Zhenhua, 30 years old, from Heishan County, Fengtian Province.</p>
<p>Question: Were you in the military before?</p>
<p>Answer: In 1925, I was a sergeant in the Second Company of the Second Battalion of the 32nd Regiment of the Eighth Division in the Northeast. Later, I fought in Zhuoxian County and was promoted to company commander. In 1927, when the unit was reorganized into the Eastern Border Garrison Commissioner's Office, I was promoted to acting major and battalion commander. Subsequently, I entered the Officer Training School for training. After graduating seven months later, I was promoted to regiment commander of the Third Regiment. After the Northeast Army's military defeat in 1932, I was unemployed.</p>
<p>Question: Tell me the whole story of your assassination of Chief Liu, clearly.</p>
<p>Answer: Three days later, Zhang Jieshi went to Tangshan to investigate and returned to Tanggu. We went straight back to the Tianjin concession together in the evening to discuss taking action. The next day (the 4th), early in the morning (around 4 or 5 AM), I took a train to Le Station around 10 o'clock, and had a meal in a small restaurant. They (i.e., Zhang and Li) arrived later, around 12 o'clock. We agreed to meet on the Lehe railway bridge and discussed how to escape after the assassination.</p>
<p>Question: How did you split up after the assassination?</p>
<p>Answer: We first gathered at Beishan. I went south, and they went northwest.</p>
<p>Question: How were you positioned when Chief Liu's train arrived at the station?</p>
<p>Answer: When Liu got off the train, I was at the west entrance of the station, Zhang Jieshi was at the east end of the train station, and Li Chunyu was fifty meters east of me.</p>
<p>Question: What weapons did Zhang and Li have?</p>
<p>Answer: Mostly box cannons. Li also carried a bomb.</p>
<p>Question: How long after Chief Liu got off the train did you take action?</p>
<p>Answer: Three or four minutes later, I saw him talking to the Japanese. I drew my gun from my waist from behind and aimed and fired.</p>
<p>Question: How did you recognize Chief Liu?</p>
<p>Answer: I saw him at Tangshan Station a month ago. I also saw him during drills in Aocheng.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you stay in Tangshan?</p>
<p>Answer: I stayed one night in a small shop at the foot of Xiaoshan.</p>
<p>Question: What was your purpose in going to Tangshan?</p>
<p>Answer: I came to take a look and find some odd jobs to make a living, but I couldn't find any employment.</p>
<p>Question: What did you do in Le County?</p>
<p>Answer: I prepared to identify Liu's appearance in advance so that it would be easier to take action in the future.</p>
<p>Question: What clothes and hat were you wearing?</p>
<p>Answer: I was wearing a blue worker's outfit and a reed hat. (Without asking when he changed clothes later, he answered: I changed them on Xiaoshan.)</p>
<p>Question: Where did you hide your gun?</p>
<p>Answer: My "lotus mouth" gun was inserted behind my waist, with the barrel facing upwards.</p>
<p>Question: How many bullets did you have?</p>
<p>Answer: Twenty.</p>
<p>Question: Did you fire from a high place or a low place?</p>
<p>Answer: I fired from the west end of the platform in a low place. I saw Chief Liu talking to Japanese soldiers. There were more than ten guards and many bystanders.</p>
<p>Question: Why didn't you implicate the others?</p>
<p>Answer: Because I aimed very accurately.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you run after firing the gun?</p>
<p>Answer: After firing the gun, I first went north towards the ticket office, then east to the bridge.</p>
<p>Question: Did anyone chase you at the time?</p>
<p>Answer: No one chased me.</p>
<p>Question: Who threw the bomb?</p>
<p>Answer: The bomb was carried by Li (i.e., Chunyu). It was placed far away. Its purpose was just to scare people. Later, he was careless and set off the explosive, injuring himself slightly on the back of his left leg.</p>
<p>Question: Where did Li hide the bomb when he brought it?</p>
<p>Answer: Wrapped in newspaper.</p>
<p>Question: What newspaper?</p>
<p>Answer: A small newspaper from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Question: Was the paper-wrapped bomb placed in a small basket?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Question: What else was in the small basket?</p>
<p>Answer: A few pears.</p>
<p>Question: How far were you from Chief Liu when you fired the gun?</p>
<p>Answer: About ten or twenty meters. I was inside the fence, shooting outwards. I didn't draw my gun; I shot with my hand behind me. Chief Liu was hit by two shots. Later, the Japanese drew their guns, and I quickly fired another shot.</p>
<p>Question: Did you run away immediately after firing the gun?</p>
<p>Answer: I didn't run away immediately. Li ran away in a hurry because everyone thought he had fired the gun, so he ran away. In fact, I fired with my hand behind my back, so at first, many people couldn't see it.</p>
<p>Question: Where did your gun go?</p>
<p>Answer: I have returned it to Zhang Jieshi.</p>
<p>Question: What about the small basket?</p>
<p>Answer: The small basket was discarded near the station's small shop.</p>
<p>Question: Where did Li Chunyu run to at the time?</p>
<p>Answer: He ran west, and I ran northwest.</p>
<p>Question: What about the clothes you changed?</p>
<p>Answer: They were packed up and taken away by Li.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you get the worker's clothes you were wearing?</p>
<p>Answer: Bought in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Question: What were your plans when you left?</p>
<p>Answer: They two returned to Tianjin and then out of the pass. I planned to go back by boat.</p>
<p>Question: How much money did you have on you?</p>
<p>Answer: Seven dollars.</p>
<p>Question: Can seven dollars get you outside the pass?</p>
<p>Answer: The travel expenses are enough; you don't need much money.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you hide on the first day (i.e., the 4th)?</p>
<p>Answer: I stayed overnight in a small shop east of Tingliu River.</p>
<p>Question: What about the second day?</p>
<p>Answer: I went to Xinzhai on the 5th, Xugezhuang on the 6th, and then to Qianying, hoping to take a train back to Tianjin. Because I heard that the hunt for the murderers was very strict, I changed my route to Wulituo and took a boat, paying four yuan. Since the boat had not yet departed, I returned to Xugezhuang to stay temporarily.</p>
<p>Question: How did you meet this man named Zhang?</p>
<p>Answer: I went to Yingkou on March 17th of the lunar calendar, then returned to Heishan. In early April, I went from Heishan to Tianzhuangtai to wait for a boat, took a sailboat to Wulituo, and then walked to Xugezhuang, took a train to Junliangcheng (May 14th) to look for a friend but couldn't find him. Then I went to Tanggu and stayed at Tianhe Inn for four days (using the name Zhang Zhihe). Then I went to Tianjin and stayed in a small inn next to the train station for three days. I also forgot the name of the inn. Then I returned to Tanggu (around May 20th) and stayed at the Fushun Inn, using the name Li Zhenhua.</p>
<p>Question: Why did you change your name the first time but not the second time?</p>
<p>Answer: Because at first, I didn't know the situation in Tanggu. Later, I learned that Tanggu didn't check inns (i.e., investigate travelers), so I used my real name the second time.</p>
<p>Question: How did you get to know Zhang Jieshi while staying at the inn?</p>
<p>Answer: I fell ill three or four days after I arrived. He was also staying there. I was sick for eight or nine days and had financial difficulties. He saw that I had no money to buy medicine and came to visit me (around June 4th or 5th) and greeted me. That's how I got to know him. When he left for Tianjin, he left a lot of money and told the innkeeper to take care of me. When he returned from Tianjin (around June 7th or 8th), I told him all my past experiences, and he considered me a confidant. Later, he went to Tianjin again and returned to Tanggu and told me that he was Shi Yousan's chief secret agent, and he was planning to expand his territory and occupy North China. It was decided in Wutaishan that the uprising would start on the 15th of the winter month, and I could be appointed as the commander of the Zunshan area.</p>
<p>Question: Did he give you the letter of appointment?</p>
<p>Answer: He brought it from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Question: Did you receive it and where did you put it?</p>
<p>Answer: I was afraid of being searched along the way and revealing the secret, so I didn't dare to receive it.</p>
<p>Question: Why did you believe he was telling the truth?</p>
<p>Answer: The official seal procedures were complete. He also said at the time that there were orders from above and that he needed my help. I asked him what was going on. He said he wanted to assassinate Liu. I asked why he wanted to kill Liu. He said it was because Liu refused to obey. As for how he refused to obey, I really didn't know the details. However, because I received his favor while I was sick, I was willing to listen to his command. Moreover, at that time, I was not fully committed. I only said that I would talk about it after I recovered from my illness. He also returned to Tianjin. Later, I came to Tangshan once.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you stay in Tangshan and what date was it?</p>
<p>Answer: Around the 7th or 8th of the first lunar month. At that time, a robbery happened, and I was afraid of being suspected, so I hid in the woods to enjoy the shade and avoid attention. I returned to Tanggu the same day and stayed in room 7 of the Fushun Inn. Later, on the 10-oddth of July, I met Zhang Jieshi. He said it was about to happen (referring to the assassination of Liu). I said I didn't recognize Liu's appearance. He said that even if I didn't recognize him, he still needed my help, and I could first go to Leizhou to "match the light" (i.e., recognize Liu's appearance). So, on July 20-something, I went to Le County and ate at the Tianjin Restaurant (early in the morning). I inquired and found out that the training corps was drilling at the north gate that day, so I went to take a look, and that's how I recognized Liu's appearance. Then I returned to Tanggu. On July 30th, he (Zhang Jieshi) came to Tangshan to inquire about news. I didn't come with him and waited for him in Tanggu. On August 3rd, Zhang Jieshi returned from Tangshan. That night, I took a car with him to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Question: Where did Zhang Jieshi stay in Tangshan?</p>
<p>Answer: I don't know.</p>
<p>Question: Did you see Shi Yousan in Tianjin?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not seen him.</p>
<p>Question: When did you first meet Li Chunyu?</p>
<p>Answer: I met him for the first time in Tanggu.</p>
<p>Question: Why did they stay in Tanggu?</p>
<p>Answer: They (i.e., Zhang and Li) often came and went and were regular customers of the Fushun Inn.</p>
<p>Question: Were all three of you wearing blue worker's clothes during the assassination?</p>
<p>Answer: Most of us were wearing blue worker's clothes.</p>
<p>Question: How much money did Zhang Jieshi give you?</p>
<p>Answer: A total of several tens of dollars.</p>
<p>Question: How many places did you have in Tianjin?</p>
<p>Answer: I have been to No. 44, 39th Road in the British Concession. I have not been to No. 3, Yoshino-cho in the Japanese Concession. Zhang Jieshi told me about it.</p>
<p>Question: How is No. 44 in Tianjin arranged?</p>

<h3 id="e73">Guangzhou Branch of Guangdong Bank Resumes Business and Liquidation Measures <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Cash will first be used to repay 10% of the debt, and liquidation bonds will be issued to clear the debt amount. A supervisory liquidation committee will be formed to auction off assets.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Guangzhou branch of Guangdong Bank was ordered to suspend operations by its head office, the Finance Department immediately dispatched personnel to take custody of its assets, awaiting liquidation. Recently, the branch manager, Chen Shanming, stated that the total debt of the Guangzhou branch was no more than three million yuan, while the cash in the warehouse was approximately 290,000 yuan. Moreover, the value of the properties owned could offset the debt amount. Therefore, he proposed to plan for the resumption of business, first using the existing cash of 290,000 yuan to repay depositors 10% in cash. Then, while resuming business, the properties would be auctioned off to gradually clear the debt amount. He drafted fourteen articles for the "Resumption of Business and Debt Liquidation Measures" and submitted them to the Guangdong Finance Department for review and approval. This was recently approved, and personnel were additionally assigned to form a supervisory liquidation committee to oversee the liquidation. The following is an appendix of the "Measures for the Resumption of Business and Debt Liquidation of the Guangzhou Branch of Guangdong Bank":</p>
<p>Article 1: To safeguard the interests of creditors, this branch has requested the Guangdong Finance Department for special permission to resume business, under the sole supervision and direction of the liquidation committee. This branch, operating under the name of the Guangzhou Branch of Guangdong Bank, will be the principal responsible for clearing debts and liabilities.</p>
<p>Article 2: The debts of this branch, whether registered or unregistered, will be addressed by first using the cash sealed in the bank's vaults to repay one-tenth of the debts. In addition, assets deemed by the supervisory liquidation committee to be equivalent to the branch's liabilities at current market value shall be designated as assets within the scope of liquidation.</p>
<p>Article 3: Debts incurred before the resumption of business of this branch will be liquidated in accordance with these measures. All business operations of the bank after the resumption of business will be handled in accordance with general banking practices and will not be subject to the supervision and direction of the supervisory liquidation committee. However, the business after the resumption of business shall absolutely not directly or indirectly utilize assets provided for the scope of liquidation.</p>
<p>Article 4: The supervisory liquidation committee shall be composed of a senior official appointed by the Finance Department, and one person each recommended by the Guangzhou District Court, the Banking Association, and a senior bank employee with accounting expertise recommended by the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The committee is responsible to the Finance Department. Its regulations shall be drafted by the committee and submitted to the Finance Department for approval. The expenses of the supervisory liquidation committee shall be minimized as much as possible.</p>
<p>Article 5: Within one week from the date of announcement of the resumption of business, this branch shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of these measures, first repay one-tenth of the principal of its debts in cash. The remaining principal and interest shall be cleared in full with "Liquidation Bonds of the Guangzhou Branch of Guangdong Bank" (hereinafter referred to as "Liquidation Bonds") prepared by this branch and affixed with the seal of the supervisory liquidation committee. The amount of Liquidation Bonds issued shall be limited to the amount of debt repaid by this branch.</p>
<p>Article 6: Small debts of less than one hundred yuan shall be paid in full in cash at the time of repayment of one-tenth in cash upon the announcement of the resumption of business.</p>
<p>Article 7: Within two weeks from the date of announcement of the resumption of business, the assets within the scope of liquidation shall be numbered and auctioned off daily in multiple installments.</p>
<p>Article 8: The bid price in the preceding article may be paid in full with Liquidation Bonds as if they were cash. However, bids paid in cash shall also be accepted.</p>
<p>Article 9: Those who owe debts to this branch before the resumption of business may purchase Liquidation Bonds received by creditors of this branch during the liquidation period and use them as full cash payment to this branch.</p>
<p>Article 10: The reserve price of the assets shall be assessed by the supervisory liquidation committee and submitted to the Finance Department for approval. The reserve price of assets that are subject to mortgage rights shall not exceed the principal and interest thereof.</p>
<p>Article 11: The auction of assets shall cease after two months from the date of commencement. Within two months after the end of the period, bondholders may exchange their bonds for assets at the reserve price. If two or more persons apply to exchange for the same asset, it shall be determined by drawing lots. Exchangers may also combine their bonds with cash to make up the difference. At the end of the period, the supervisory liquidation committee shall tally the cash sealed in the vaults of this branch. After deducting the 10% repayment, the remaining amount, along with the total cash received from those who paid for assets in cash and the total cash received from those who repaid debts to this branch, shall be used for a second cash repayment. In addition, for any remaining debt, the creditors shall hold the Liquidation Bonds issued by this branch. At that time, this branch shall again provide assets within the scope of liquidation, deemed by the supervisory liquidation committee to be equivalent to the branch's liabilities at current market value. The supervisory liquidation committee shall convene a meeting of creditors at that time to discuss the custody of these assets. The assets may be kept by a creditors' association, or entrusted to a trust company for management, as determined by the creditors' meeting. All income or proceeds from the sale of these assets, regardless of amount, shall be distributed to the bondholding creditors at that time. Upon completion of these matters, the supervisory liquidation committee may be dissolved, and the liquidation task of this branch shall be completed.</p>
<p>Article 12: Expenses incurred as a result of the liquidation shall be paid from the assets of this branch that are not designated as within the scope of liquidation.</p>
<p>Article 13: These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Finance Department.</p>
<p>Article 14: Any matters not covered by these measures may be amended by this branch upon submission by the supervisory liquidation committee to the Finance Department for approval.</p>
<p>Taicang: Public Security Bureau Intercepts Bandits</p>
<p>A suspicious boat was anchored under the Dongtingzi Bridge outside the East Gate at approximately 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The boat contained a small amount of rice straw, three reed mats, and an old man in his fifties. Seven or eight burly men were scattered on the shore, arousing suspicion among nearby residents. They immediately reported the information to Zhu Anxiang, the stationed police officer, who, together with Yang Qingyun and other police officers from the East Gate station, first detained the boat and placed the old man under surveillance. A search of the boat yielded one Bai Langlin pistol with serial number 639150 and one with serial number 607783, along with bullets and one magazine. The bandits on shore scattered and fled. The personnel and items were immediately taken to the bureau for investigation. Upon receiving the report, the county bureau immediately dispatched groups to search the area and apprehended nine individuals, including Yao Genyuan from Shanghai and Zhou Jinwen from the local area, at the home of Liang Guiqing in the third ward of Dongyi Township. They also apprehended Li Zifang from Henan at Xidoukou, and Chai Mingchen, Wang Baoyuan, and Chen Helin, all from elsewhere, near the Sihulu bus station. All were wearing tattered military uniforms. All of the above individuals are highly suspected and have been taken to the bureau for interrogation. A temporary curfew was imposed that night, and all city gates were closed early for strict searches in order to maintain order and public safety.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Chamber of Commerce Headquarters, upon receiving orders to reorganize all Chambers of Commerce into guard posts under the command of the township heads, and to convert all volunteer members into reserve militiamen, and considering the importance of local security, especially at the beginning of winter, specially convened a meeting of branch chiefs. They unanimously advocated for a temporary postponement of the reorganization due to the urgent need for urban and rural defense. However, as this matter concerns all counties, a unified stance should be adopted. Vice-officer Zhang Haishan was specially dispatched to Wuxi to solicit opinions. Wu Shuying from the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce recently came to Suzhou to discuss the matter. It is heard that after contacting each county, representatives from the Chambers of Commerce of various counties will be convened in Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce in the coming days to discuss methods together, or perhaps send representatives to the provincial government to plead their case.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Embezzlement and Flight Suspect Arrested in Xicheng</p>
<p>Zhang Xichen, a Jiangyin native working as a runner at the Ruichangrun money exchange in this city, failed in his speculative business ventures. On the 29th of last month, he impersonated others to embezzle 6,000 yuan in circulating loans from the Fuyuanfu and Yuyu money exchanges and fled. His wife, Ms. Di (also known as Zhiming), committed suicide by cutting herself on the 2nd of this month, late at night. His mother-in-law, Di Lu, also committed suicide by jumping into a well in Cheng on the 6th of this month, late at night. Zhang himself was apprehended by the Cheng Public Security Bureau and is currently under custody. It is learned that after being arrested, Zhang has refused to eat or drink, intending to starve himself to death. Yesterday (the 8th), the city Public Security Bureau ordered detectives to go to Cheng to bring Zhang back to Wuxi for trial in court.</p>
<p>The Famous Poison Pill Case Concludes</p>
<p>Chen Shaokun, an accomplice of the famous poison pill offender Wang Guiqing, along with his concubine Ms. Tu Hu, and seven others, were arrested last year and sentenced to imprisonment by the provincial court. Wang himself was arrested in Shanghai this May and transferred to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command, where he was executed by shooting on the 30th of last month. Su Guoliang and Zheng Deliang, two others involved in the same case as Wang, were sentenced at the same time. Su was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zheng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 500 yuan. After being sent back to the Wuxi County Government for execution, Ms. Wang Hu, who had been sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, vehemently denied assisting her husband in producing poison, and Wang Guiqing also insisted that his wife was not involved. The case was thoroughly investigated and clarified, and no guilt could be found. The county was ordered to revoke the original judgment. Upon receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang immediately instructed Judge He to bring Ms. Wang Hu to court for release.</p>

<h3 id="e75">How the Sun, Moon, and Stars Move and the Phenomena Resulting from Their Movement (I) (Lectures to the National Public on October 18, 21, 27, and 28) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>—Researcher at the Institute of Astronomy, Academia Sinica, Chen Zun'gui</p>
<p>The topic I will be discussing today is "How the Sun, Moon, and Stars Move." But what are the sun, moon, and stars? Everyone knows that the sun is the sun, the moon is the moon, and all the stars besides the sun and moon are called stars. The reason for this distinction is simply because the sun and moon are larger than all other stars, and their relationship with us humans is particularly close. This is the general public's concept of the scattered points of light in the sky, so the term "sun, moon, and stars" is a common phrase, not a scientific term.</p>
<p>From a scientific perspective, using astronomical terminology, we don't call them "sun, moon, and stars," but rather use the term "celestial bodies" to represent them. That is, all the stars in space are called celestial bodies. So the term "celestial bodies" represents various different stars, because there is more than one sun in the universe (the five or six thousand small points of light in the sky that we see with the naked eye, or the tens of millions of star images obtained by astronomers through photography, with the exception of a very few, each small point of light is a sun, because they are very far away from us, so we cannot see them as large as our sun). Nor is there only one moon (it is now known that there are a total of twenty-six moons in our solar system), and there are other types of celestial bodies with different phenomena. So astronomers divide all the stars in the universe into several types, and the way they are classified is based on their movement and shape. Therefore, if we want to know how a certain star moves, we can know which category it belongs to. We will now explain the movement of each type of celestial body.</p>
<p>All celestial bodies in the universe can be divided into two major categories: the solar system and the stellar realm. What is the solar system? The solar system takes the sun as the protagonist, and planets, satellites, comets, and meteors as its members. All celestial bodies other than those belonging to the solar system are classified into the stellar realm. The stellar realm is naturally all fixed stars. What are fixed stars? Fixed stars are all the other celestial bodies besides those in the solar system; the relative positions of these celestial bodies remain almost unchanged, and these celestial bodies are called fixed stars, meaning that they are permanently unmoving. However, within fixed stars, there are also names such as double stars, variable stars, star clusters, and nebulae. As for the Nova Herculis discovered last year, it is a nova, which is just one type of variable star. Now we will explain the movement of each type of celestial body separately.</p>
<p>Let's start with the solar system. First is the sun. As mentioned above, every fixed star is a sun. Conversely, our sun is one of the tens of millions of fixed stars, so their position can be said to be permanently unmoving, that is to say, they have no movement. But everyone must say that we see the sun rising in the east and setting in the west every day, isn't this the sun changing its position? Doesn't it also have movement? In fact, it is not so. The daily rising and setting of the sun is not the sun's own movement, but the earth's rotation. Because the earth rotates once a day, when we are facing the sun, it is daytime, and when we are facing away from the sun, it is night. It looks like the sun is moving, but in fact the sun is not moving.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about planets. Simply put, the movement of planets is that they revolve around the sun as their center. That is, the sun remains stationary in the center, and each planet revolves around the sun once a year. The earth is also a planet, so we define the time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun once as a year.</p>
<p>The planets we currently know can be divided into two types: large and small. There are nine large planets in total. In order of distance from the sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. These nine large planets all revolve around the sun. But because their distances from the sun are different, the time they need to complete one revolution is also different. Now, taking the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun as one year, which is about 365 days, as the standard, Mercury and Venus are closer to the sun than the Earth, so the time they need to complete one revolution is less than one year. Mercury is only about 88 days, and Venus is about 225 days. From Mars to Pluto, their distance from the sun is farther than the Earth, so the time they need to complete one revolution is longer than one year. Mars requires 687 days, about two years, Jupiter 4,332 days (about twelve years), Saturn about twenty-nine and a half years, Uranus about eighty-four years, Neptune about 165 years, and Pluto is farther away, so it requires 249 years for one revolution. As for the small planets, there are currently 1,264 confirmed ones, and about 1,000 more that are not yet confirmed. Their movement is the same as that of the large planets: they revolve around the sun as their center, and their orbital paths are between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<p>Third, satellites. Anything that revolves around a planet as its center is called a satellite. A satellite means to protect the planet. The moon is the Earth's satellite. Because it revolves around the Earth as its center once a month. So the ordinary moon only refers to the Earth's satellite, but in the astronomical sense. The moon is a satellite, so as mentioned above, there is more than one moon, there are a total of twenty-six, but the Earth only has one moon. As for the moons of other planets, for example, Mars has two moons, Jupiter has nine, Saturn also has nine, Uranus four, and Neptune nine. Each revolves around the planet, and we can see their movement through a telescope. The most obvious are the movements of Jupiter's first through fourth moons. When we observe Jupiter with a small telescope, we can see four small stars around it. Those four small stars are its moons (the other five are too small, and the small telescope cannot see them). Sometimes we only see three, because one of them has gone behind Jupiter.</p>
<p>The time it takes for a planet to revolve around the sun is called a year, and the time it takes for a satellite to revolve around a planet is called a month. The length of a year varies depending on the distance between the planet and the sun, as mentioned above. The length of a month varies depending on the distance between the satellite and its planet. Now, speaking of our Earth, the time it takes for the moon to revolve around the Earth is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 11 seconds. Speaking of Jupiter's moon, the closest moon only needs 1 day, 18 hours, 28 minutes, and 36 seconds to revolve around Jupiter, while the farthest one needs 636 days to revolve around Jupiter. So if there were humans on Jupiter, they could see nine moons, and they could see several moons on the same day, which would be so beautiful! We humans on Earth are unfortunate to only have one moon, and those elegant talents still write poems and admire the moon when it is full. If they encountered the nine moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the phenomena of the moons rising and setting, and the strange and beautiful lights, would surely be too much for them to admire!</p>
<p>The above is the true movement of planets and satellites. But we are on the Earth, not on the sun, so the way we see planets moving in the sky is different. In astronomy, the movement we see with our eyes is called apparent motion. For example, the sun is originally stationary, but because of the Earth's rotation, we feel that the sun is constantly moving, rising in the east and setting in the west every day. This is the movement of the sun that we see, and it is not the true movement of the sun. As for how we see planets moving in the sky from the Earth, we only feel that they are moving around the ecliptic, either from west to east or from east to west. The former is called direct motion, and the latter is called retrograde motion. When changing from direct motion to retrograde motion, or from retrograde motion to direct motion, we see the planet as if it is not moving, which is called stationary, meaning not moving. For example, in mid-July of this year, at 8 or 9 p.m., we can see a very bright white star in the southwest, which is Jupiter. A little to its west is a red star, which is Mars. Later, their distance gradually approaches, until about August 28, they are almost together. Afterwards, Jupiter is to the west of Mars. During these times, Jupiter and Mars are both in direct motion, that is, they are both moving from west to east, but their speeds are different. However, Jupiter was in retrograde motion from east to west before July 12, and stopped moving on the 12th, and then resumed direct motion from west to east.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Mayor Wu's Announcement to the Citizens Yesterday: Fundraising for the Boy Scouts for Disaster Relief <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's announcement to the citizens regarding the Boy Scout fundraising for disaster relief stated: "Our country has suffered frequent disasters for many years. This summer, continuous heavy rain led to mountain torrents and floods. The Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and Han River have all reported disasters successively. The disaster areas cover more than ten provinces, including Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Henan. The number of disaster victims is tens of millions, exceeding that of the 20th year of the Republic. The refugees are displaced and homeless, their faces gaunt and emaciated, lying stiffly on the roadsides. The misery is so great that it does not require Zheng Xia's map to know. Now that the severe winter climate has arrived, they are suffering from hunger and cold. Putting ourselves in their place, how can we not feel sorrow? Shanghai is the wealthiest area in the country, but in recent years, the market has been sluggish, and all industries are depressed. In addition, the rural economy in the interior has collapsed, and the impact has gradually led to the decline of past prosperity. However, we, facing these difficult times, should even more demonstrate the spirit of mutual aid and self-rescue among the Chinese people, to provide a glimmer of hope for the disaster victims, and to preserve a portion of the nation's vitality. Moreover, the extravagant lifestyle in Shanghai today has still not been avoided. A little frugality does not seem difficult. We live in peace in Shanghai, with clothing and food. Based on the principle of being mindful of danger in times of peace, we should do our best to have compassion for our compatriots in various places who have no clothing and food. Otherwise, when disasters come, the consequences will be unimaginable. Recently, the Shanghai fundraising committee for the flood disaster relief in various provinces is organizing a city-wide mobilization of Boy Scouts. On the 9th and 10th of this month, they will solicit donations for the flood disaster. All our citizens and various industry groups should embrace the spirit of regarding others' hunger and drowning as their own, and fulfill the great wishes of compassion and mercy. Actively contribute and generously donate to help the disaster victims and benefit the country. This is truly what is hoped for."</p>
<h3 id="e77">Boy Scout Fundraising Begins Today <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors Issues an Announcement to All Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>The fundraising group of the Shanghai flood disaster relief association for various provinces, because of this year's mountain torrents and floods in the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and Han River, one after another disaster was reported. The people were suffering, displaced and homeless. The misery was unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. Moreover, it has already reached the cold winter season, suffering from hunger and crying in the cold. Their situation is especially miserable. Therefore, it appeals for donations to save the disaster victims. Since the start of the work, it has been deeply supported by all parties. Fortunately, the results have been very significant. However, it is like a cup of water trying to put out a cartload of burning firewood. It is difficult to be universal. Therefore, in addition to the fundraising by various sectors and the various recreational activities held one after another to help with disaster relief, it was also agreed with the China Boy Scout Council to hold a city-wide Boy Scout mobilization to raise donations to assist in disaster relief. The Boy Scouts in this city have a long history, and are astute and capable. They can be said to be involved in all matters related to local public welfare. In terms of disaster relief, they have already participated twice, and each time the results have been good, and they have been respected by the people of Shanghai. This year, the disaster situation in various places is particularly serious. Although the people of Shanghai have donated generously, it is difficult to achieve universality. Therefore, after considering many people's opinions, it was decided to ask the entire Boy Scout organization in this city to mobilize and raise donations for nine days. The 9th and 10th were designated as the days for external fundraising, and the 11th to 17th were designated as the days for internal fundraising. The donation tickets are divided into four types: 10 cents, 20 cents, 1 yuan, and 20 cents and 40 cents. It is up to the donors to choose the amount. During this fundraising period, Li Dachao, deputy director of the fundraising group of the flood disaster relief association, and Luo Lie and Xie Yanbo of the Boy Scout Council will be responsible. A temporary office will be jointly established on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. It will be open all day from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM to facilitate contact at any time. The association has previously sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Public Security Bureau and the Security Office, and has also sent letters to the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to provide protection. It has received letters in reply from the Municipal Government, the Public Concession, and the French Concession, promising to provide practical assistance during the fundraising period. In addition to Mayor Wu's announcement to the citizens, which can be seen in another section, the announcement to all fellow citizens by the Shanghai Special City Council of the China Boy Scout and the fundraising guidelines for the Boy Scout mobilization are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement to Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Council of the China Boy Scout, for the city-wide Boy Scout flood disaster relief mobilization, respectfully announces to all fellow citizens: "In this time of frequent national disasters, when our entire nation is seeking survival, the vast heavens have unexpectedly sent continuous heavy rain. According to investigations from various parties, the disaster areas cover more than ten provinces, and the number of affected people is over tens of millions, exceeding that of the 20th year of the Republic. The disaster victims are everywhere, suffering from hunger and waiting for death. Cities have sunk and been submerged, corpses are scattered everywhere, crying for husbands and searching for sons. It is unbearable to witness. Now that autumn is over and winter is coming, looking at those poor people, displaced and destitute, suffering from hunger and cold, enduring death and waiting for rescue, everyone feels compassion. Putting ourselves in their place, how can we not shed tears in silence? Our Boy Scouts take benevolence and courage as their training, and know and act in a habitual manner. In particular, taking daily good deeds as the purpose of their embrace, and the sincerity of helping others at any time and any place, we should rise up bravely for this major responsibility of disaster relief, saving people, and saving the country. Therefore, from November 9th to 17th of this year, we will hold a city-wide Boy Scout flood disaster relief mobilization to broadly implement fundraising, so that we can gather strength and benefit the disaster victims, and save this major crisis of the Chinese nation. We hope that all fellow citizens and people from all walks of life will generously donate to do their best, embrace the heart of regarding others' drowning as their own, and the responsibility of saving others as saving themselves. Actively contribute, and the future of our Chinese nation truly depends on it."</p>
<p>Fundraising Guidelines</p>
<p>Fundraising Guidelines for the City-Wide Boy Scout Mobilization for Flood Disaster Relief in Various Provinces in Shanghai: 1. This time, according to the order of the China Boy Scout General Association and the letter from the Shanghai Flood Disaster Relief Association, the Shanghai Special City Council of the China Boy Scout (hereinafter referred to as "this Council") will be responsible for organizing the city-wide Boy Scout mobilization for flood disaster relief in various provinces. 2. All Boy Scout groups in this city that have been registered and approved or are in the process of registration must send all Boy Scouts to participate in the fundraising work. 3. The date of the Boy Scout mobilization for flood disaster relief in this city is set from November 9th to 17th, a total of nine days. The 9th and 10th are the days for Boy Scouts to conduct external fundraising, and the week from the 11th to the 17th is the day for Boy Scouts to conduct internal fundraising. 4. On the Boy Scout's external fundraising days (i.e., the 9th and 10th), Boy Scouts can solicit donations from residents, businesses, foreign firms, organizations, hotels, amusement parks, and other various places within the areas designated by this Council from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day (absolutely avoid soliciting donations along the way). 5. On the Boy Scout's internal fundraising days (i.e., the week from the 11th to the 17th), each Boy Scout can do their best to solicit donations from their relatives and friends during their spare time. 6. Boy Scouts participating in external fundraising will have their schools excuse them from classes, through a letter from this Council to the Municipal Education Bureau, asking the schools to do so. 7. The donation tickets used are divided into 10 cents, 20 cents, 1 yuan, and 20 cents and 40 cents. 8. Each group of Boy Scouts participating in external fundraising should consist of three to five people. 9. When Boy Scouts go out to solicit donations, they must be neatly dressed. 10. Special attention must be paid to the language and attitude during fundraising. 11. Be sure to use donation tickets to make up the amount of the donations received. For example, if the amount of the donations received is 30 cents, you can give one 10-cent donation ticket and one 20-cent donation ticket. If the amount of the donations received is 1 yuan and 50 cents, you can give five 10-cent donation tickets and one 1-yuan donation ticket. And so on. The most important thing is that the number of donation tickets matches the amount of the donation. 12. When soliciting donations, be sure to explain the reasons for fundraising in detail, and use tactful words. Do not force donations or speak rudely. 13. When soliciting donations, be sure to bring a grain bag or a small box to store the donations. Special attention must be paid to the safekeeping of the donations received. 14. If there is a special situation or the donation tickets are insufficient, you can contact the temporary office at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on the external fundraising days. During the internal fundraising period, you can contact this Council at the Nanshi Daji Road Public Sports Field. 15. Boy Scouts should adhere to the spirit of love and cooperation. In the same area, it is even more inappropriate to have conflicts. 16. The donations raised by each Boy Scout group should be submitted to this Council at any time before November 18th so that they can be remitted to the flood disaster relief association. 17. Each group should submit a report to this Council before November 6th, reporting the exact number of participants. 18. The donation ticket booklet must be signed and stamped by the group leader and the group. Each group should send personnel to the Council between November 7th and 8th to collect donation tickets, badges, and area maps. 19. All Boy Scouts participating in fundraising who raise more than 3 yuan will be issued a commemorative badge. Those with particularly excellent results, in the top 20 individuals, will also be given a special award by Mayor Wu. 20. All Boy Scout groups participating in fundraising with more than 20 participants, and an average of more than 3 yuan raised per person, will be issued a commemorative certificate. Those with particularly excellent results, in the top 10 groups, will also be given a special award by Mayor Wu. The Boy Scout groups whose total amount of donations raised is in proportion to the number of participants, and whose results are excellent in the top 10, will also be given a special award by Mayor Wu. 21. All Boy Scout halls should do their best to solicit donations in order to achieve the purpose of helping people and disaster relief. 22. When each group finishes fundraising, they should immediately announce the receipts given by this Council and the fundraising results of each member of the group within the group. 23. Each group should submit the total amount of donations and the individual fundraising results of the Boy Scouts to this Council before November 18th so that commemorative badges can be issued.</p>

<p>Minister Kong arrived at the Central Bank around 8:00 AM yesterday morning to handle official business. He immediately summoned Finance Vice Minister Xu Kan, Central Bank Vice Presidents Zhang Gongquan and Chen Hang, and Director of the Business Bureau Xi Desheng, and inquired in detail about the bank's affairs.

<p>Subsequently, at 10:30 AM, Minister Kong convened the second regular meeting of the Issuance Preparation Management Committee in the conference room of the bank's board of directors. Standing Committee members Song Ziwen, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, and Li Jue attended, as well as Drafting Committee member Xu Kan, and committee members Zhu Ziliang and Zhang Peishen.

The draft was prepared by the Drafting Committee, and two meetings have been held to discuss it. After yesterday's discussion, it was decided to submit it to the committee members for research. A second plenary meeting will be convened in the coming days to approve it, submit it to the Ministry for approval, and then announce it for implementation.</p>
<p>Central Mint Review Committee</p>
<p>The 27th regular meeting of the Central Mint Review Committee was held at 4:30 PM yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. The committee members present were Minister Kong, Hao Shumin, Yabuki Keiichi, Mackay, Beisson, Yoshida Masaharu, Xu Jikang, David, Xi Demao, Lin Shu, Geng Aide, Steedman, Rice, Staging, Ye Zhuotang, Xue Layton, Chen Zheqing, Xu Xinliu, Ye Fuxiao, Hu Mengjia, and Hu Yunzhuang, a total of 22 people. Chen Jian'an, Director of the Mint, Wei Xianzhang, Deputy Director of the Mint, Qiao Fusan, Secretary of the Review Committee, Ge Laide, Chemical Inspector, Chairman Minister Kong, and Recorder Li Zhelang attended as observers.</p>
<p>Legal New Currency of Over 4 Million</p>
<p>After the Chairman announced the opening of the meeting and passed the minutes of the previous meeting, Secretary Qiao Fusan reported that the review of the legal new currency in October amounted to 4,450,000 yuan, which had been approved for delivery and would be listed for announcement and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. A detailed report was also given on the assessment of factory affairs, the review of the factory's accounts, and the committee's work in October. The Chemical Inspector then reported that the color and weight of the new currency produced in October were all within the legal tolerance. The meeting adjourned at 4:55 PM.</p>
<p>New Auxiliary Currency; Foreign Exchange as Usual</p>
<p>From yesterday, the Central Bank issued new printed dark green 10-cent auxiliary currency notes and purple 50-cent auxiliary currency notes. They are the same as the 10-cent, 20-cent, and 25-cent auxiliary currency notes previously issued. A public announcement has been made. The foreign exchange rates announced by the bank yesterday were the same as the previous few days, except that the Hong Kong dollar slightly increased by 5 yuan, with 100 yuan of national currency equivalent to 85 yuan. It is said that this is the result of the implementation of the suspension of the use of coins in Hong Kong. The balance tax announced by the Foreign Exchange Equilibrium Committee is still 57.25%.</p>
<p>Allocation of Head and Tail Already Implemented</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new currency system policy, the issue of allocating heads and tails in the silver and money industry was raised by the Bankers Association for discussion. It was decided that the association's joint reserve treasury, together with the money industry's reserve treasury, would consult with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to equalize the allocation. It is said that the two industry reserve treasuries have now notified the banks and shops to implement it. Those who had more tails but lacked heads have complied and have conducted non-profit allocation of heads with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Therefore, the previous so-called adding water to the head has now become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>International Chamber of Commerce Soliciting Essays</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the International Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Chinese branch yesterday, inviting Chairman Zhang Gongquan and Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu to write an essay on China's currency system reform and international trade to be published in the International Commerce Monthly, so that people of all countries can understand the significance of China's currency system reform.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Reissue a Notice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau that, after the Municipal Government ordered the stabilization of currency policy, the prices of goods in this city have risen, and strict suppression should be carried out. All guilds were instructed to submit appropriate price lists within three days of receiving the order for review. The Chamber of Commerce has replied that the association has already sent separate letters to the bean and rice industry, rice shop industry, and tobacco exchange industry to stabilize prices and exchange rates, and must not exceed a price increase or arbitrary depression. Now, after receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, another circular has been sent to all guilds to comply, and the handling situation will be reported.</p>
<p>Seamen's Union Sends Telegram to the Ministry in Support</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shi Society, the representative office of the Chinese Seamen's Union recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to support the Ministry's promulgation of the fixed legal currency policy. The telegram reads: "To the Ministry of Finance of the Nanjing National Government: Your ministry's promulgation of the fixed legal currency case will stabilize finance and prosper the market. After the promulgation of this case, China and foreign countries alike have celebrated and rejoiced. All shops in the country have followed suit. Moreover, cash management is strict and reserves are sufficient, which is the best currency policy. The entire staff of the General Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union sincerely supports it. This telegram is respectfully submitted, and we pray for your inspection. The representative office of the Chinese Seamen's Union, on the day."</p>
<h3 id="e79">The General Labor Union Notifies All Labor Unions to Prevent Smuggling of Silver <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Transport Workers Must Not Transport for Unscrupulous Merchants; If Discovered, Report to the Military Police at Any Time</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong Society, the Municipal General Labor Union, fearing that unscrupulous merchants would use workers to smuggle silver for export after the Ministry of Finance implemented currency reform, especially notified transportation unions and other industry unions yesterday, requesting them to instruct their members to strictly prevent it. The original text reads: "In order to issue a notification, since the world economic panic in recent years, various countries have changed their currency policies. As a result, the price of silver has soared. As a result, our country is the first to bear the brunt. Huge trade deficits and the overflow of large amounts of silver have caused domestic industry and commerce to decline, rural areas to go bankrupt, and the entire financial foundation to fall into a crisis. Our government, in view of the urgency, resolutely announced currency reform, nationalizing the existing silver and implementing currency management, hoping that the endangered industry and commerce can be restored and the economic foundation can be further stabilized. The news came and we were deeply rejoiced. However, at the beginning of the implementation of the new policy, unscrupulous merchants will inevitably privately collect silver coins and silver coins and smuggle them for export. The authorities have already strictly investigated and cracked down. All of our city's workers should assist in preventing it. This special notification is given to the association, requesting you to instruct your members not to privately transport silver for unscrupulous merchants. If any of the above situations are found, they should report to the military police at any time to protect the national funds and jointly promote the prosperity of the market. This is very important. This is a special notification. Chairman Zhu Xuefan, Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, Ye Xiangdou."</p>

<h3 id="e82">Miscellaneous Grain Merchants Work Hard to Eliminate Donations; Petitioning the Fifth National Congress <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xin Yi Went to Nanjing First to Present the Petition; Representatives of Manufacturers from Various Places Will Come to Shanghai Separately</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong Society, the national delegation of miscellaneous grain and oil cake manufacturers, in order to request the abolition of the donation, decided to petition the Fifth National Congress. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Guild, went to Nanjing first yesterday morning to submit the petition to the Central Committee members. Representatives from various places can arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing a Petition Group</p>
<p>The National Federation of Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Manufacturers, in order to strive for the abolition of the additional donation on bran in Guangdong Province, previously appointed representatives of manufacturers from Shanghai, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Jinan, Bengbu, Shantou, and Hankou to organize a petition group. It was originally scheduled to hold a petition at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. However, due to insufficient procedures and the fact that representatives from various places have not yet arrived, it was decided to change it to an expanded petition at the Fifth National Congress on the 12th of this month to achieve the goal of abolishing the bran donation.</p>
<p>Gu Xin Yi Goes to Nanjing</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild in this city, in order to make the Central Committee understand the request to abolish the bran donation, as well as the operating difficulties of manufacturers over the years, so as to provide a reference for the representatives of the Fifth National Congress and provide strong assistance, took the petition prepared by the National Federation of Manufacturers and took a train to Nanjing yesterday morning to deliver it to the Central Committee members in Nanjing and representatives attending the meeting, requesting their assistance.</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Places Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Representatives of oil cake manufacturers from Hankou, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, Jinan, and Shantou will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The National Federation of Manufacturers plans to hold another joint meeting after representatives from various places arrive in Shanghai to discuss all the steps for the petition and supplement the various opinions on the petition.</p>

<h3 id="e84">American Merchants Resuming River Shipping on the Yangtze River <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Currently in the Planning Stage</p>
<p>In recent months, the rise of river shipping on the Yangtze River has broken records of the past ten years. The American Yangtze River Shipping Company was originally engaged in river shipping on the Yangtze River. This year, it suddenly sold all nine of its river vessels to Taikoo and Minsheng. Unexpectedly, after the ships were sold, business was restored. Larger ships, running on a single route, had cargo and passenger income of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The water freight for a single piece of cargo increased to more than 36 yuan, four times higher than before. There is still a trend for continued increases in the future. For cargo on this route, cash must be paid first before loading. To date, the Yangtze River route is not only the first route in China, but also has such high freight rates that are unmatched by any other shipping route in the world. Currently, there are foreign ships from England, Japan, Italy, and France on the Yangtze River. Since the American Yangtze River Shipping Company sold its ships and stopped running, there have been no American ships on inland waterways in China. It has now been confirmed that it will send ships again to retain its shipping rights in China. The Yangtze River Shipping Company has decided to make a comeback. Many American merchants have discussed it several times, advocating the reconstruction of the latest type of diesel river ships to sail on the Shanghai-Chongqing route. It is now known that the planning has already begun to take shape. It is still under discussion whether the Yangtze River name will still be used in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Haiyun Shipping Company: Regular Service to Lǎojiào <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A General Overview of Goods from the Northwest</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's combined land and water transportation route at Lianyungang is operating very successfully. Initially, chartered ships were used, which was very uneconomical, with each ship costing 100,000 to 110,000 yuan per year in charter fees. Therefore, General Manager Liu Hongsheng specially purchased a ship from France, costing just over 70,000 pounds, with construction and repairs totaling only 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. It has now been completed, and the crew and sailors have already been assigned. This ship is larger than those dedicated to the Lǎojiào route, making it even more cost-effective. The maiden voyage has been set for the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>It will depart from Shanghai, and then operate on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Goods from the Northwest</p>
<p>After the company established the combined land and water transportation route with the Longhai Railway, it attracted the attention of private companies. Dà Zhèn and Hé Zhòng have recently cooperated to launch a non-combined transportation service between Shanghai and Lǎojiào, intending to compete. However, regarding the goods coming from the Northwest, the main commodities and annual quantities are not clearly understood even by those in the shipping industry. Since the combined transportation route was established, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has assigned specialists to classify and compile statistics based on the cargo manifests of all combined transportation goods from the Northwest throughout the previous year. The largest categories of goods are soybeans, peanuts, wheat, cotton, melon seeds, miscellaneous grains, and miscellaneous goods such as furs and water tobacco.</p>
<p>Annual Statistics</p>
<p>In 1934, the goods transported from the Northwest to Shanghai via the Longhai Railway and loaded at Lianyungang were thoroughly investigated. A total of 137,420 tons arrived during the year, including 41,961 tons of soybeans, 37,916 tons of peanut kernels, 31,616 tons of wheat, 6,013 tons of cotton, 4,562 tons of melon seeds, and 4,439 tons of miscellaneous grains, which were the largest quantities. Other goods totaled 10,919 tons. This statistical compilation took several months of effort by the combined transportation department and will be submitted to the General Manager for review once the draft report is completed.</p>
<p>Business Overview</p>
<p>Looking at the overall business of the Northwest combined transportation, the months with the most incoming goods are January, November, and December, while July and August are relatively quiet. For cotton, there were no shipments in July, August, and September throughout the year. According to last year's statistics, the Longhai Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company jointly transported over 137,000 tons of goods. The Longhai Railway received three-quarters of the freight revenue, while China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received one-quarter. Based on a net income of four yuan per ton, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company earned over 540,000 yuan annually, while the Longhai Railway had an income of approximately 1.67 million yuan.</p>

<p>Per-Call Charges Will Impact Concession Prosperity; Special Users Have Already Implemented This Measure, Making It Unnecessary</p>
<p>The China National Industries Association believes that Shanghai Telephone Company's plan to charge per call will increase the burden on industry and commerce and goes against the habits of the Chinese people. Therefore, at a members' meeting on the 5th of this month, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association proposed a discussion, which was immediately passed to protest in writing to the Municipal Council. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Burden Impacts Production</p>
<p>To the esteemed Shanghai Municipal Council,</p>
<p>We are writing to you on behalf of the managers of 74 factories, members of our association’s Shanghai factories section. They have informed us that the Shanghai Telephone Company recently eliminated the fixed-rate system and will change to a per-call charging scheme, which will suddenly increase the burden and directly and indirectly impact production and business. They request our association to make a strong appeal to your board of directors to avoid being swayed by one-sided reasons from the company and being misled, so that general users do not suffer disadvantages. The reasons they hold can be summarized in the following points for your consideration:</p>
<p>Concession Prosperity Will Decline</p>
<p>(1) Psychology and habits have a great relationship with the use of materials. In the past, business facilities and personnel exchanges in industry and commerce were not as cumbersome and complex as they are today. Therefore, in today's world, from the psychological point of view of a user, as long as there is telephone communication equipment, there can be many business exchanges. Therefore, the number of users increases, and the telephone company can maintain the number of lines without reducing it. This is half psychological effect and half the result of habit. If the old system is changed now, and general users feel that every time they make a phone call, they will have to worry about increased costs in the future, then they will have a sense of caution when making calls, and they will definitely consider the number of calls again and again. They will never call unless it is absolutely necessary. Over time, the number of calls will naturally decrease. As for the final result, a company or a household gradually feels that there is no need to install a telephone, and it must resort to dismantling the telephone equipment. Regarding this, our association members are thinking about the business prosperity of industry and commerce in the Public Concession. The heads of the Municipal Council should weigh the importance of things and not be fooled by the telephone company. After all, public utilities are closely related to industry and commerce. If industry and commerce are given direct convenience today, it will indirectly give the company a chance to develop in the future. The interests are related and the difference is huge. If it is only to guarantee the interest on the company’s capital, and it is said that under the so-called healthy situation, a certain situation must be reached, and the shareholder capital must be guaranteed, then it is truly short-sighted and does not recognize the times. As a result, the prosperity of the Public Concession will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>Oppressing Users, Harming People to Benefit Oneself</p>
<p>(2) In major cities around the world, such as London, Berlin, Paris, etc., fees are charged according to equipment. The only purpose and advantage of this equipment is to facilitate users and prosper the market. In short, anyone who operates for shareholders can report news in a timely manner and activate the market. The financial market relies on it for sufficient turnover, and users have become accustomed to it for a long time. Among those engaged in telephone business and those who specialize in telephone business, I have never heard of charging. Comparing the benefits with the written statement issued by the telephone company regarding charging according to equipment, it does not pay attention to the interests of users at all, and does not mention the responsibilities that it should bear. It only calculates the interests of the company and how to oppress users in order to guarantee the interest on capital. Its evil intentions of harming others to benefit itself can be measured.</p>
<p>Please Uphold Justice and Refute It</p>
<p>In short, our association stands on the position of protecting industry and commerce and is responsible to all members. We believe that the above two points are quite reasonable. Therefore, in the form of a protest, we put forward our opinions and ask you to uphold justice and the big picture when the board of directors convenes a meeting to discuss the expert report, and refute the Shanghai Telephone Company's proposal. At the same time, we also ask your board of directors to ask the company what responsibilities it bears and what certainty it has in terms of substance and reasons for this change in regulations. (1) In terms of the current situation, the connection between the Concession and the Chinese area telephones has long been charged by the number of times, and disputes over the error and inaccuracy of the count continue to occur. If the old system is abolished and per-call charging is used this time, can the count be guaranteed to be accurate? (2) Assuming that this change in regulations will increase the company's income, what certainty is there? If the income still cannot be increased in the future, what steps will the company take at that time? (3) The connection in the Western District of Shanghai is still manual. If the count is inaccurate every time, it is the fault of the operator. What responsibilities should users bear for the payment?</p>
<p>Only Causes Disputes; Policy is Wrong</p>
<p>In our association’s opinion, in the current situation of the Shanghai Telephone Company, all special users, such as hotels, restaurants, and other entertainment venues, have all been changed to a per-call charging system. The company has already exploited the part of the revenue that can be increased. In the midst of this extremely depressed industry and commerce and the extremely declining market, the company’s focus is not on thinking about the big picture, but on focusing on users who use less traffic, increasing their burden. It seems that it may not be able to achieve any results, only causing social disputes. The users are resentful. Weighing the pros and cons, the latter is more. Regarding this, our association and members, as well as many foreign merchants, have repeatedly exchanged opinions and believe that the company’s policy is wrong. Changing the regulations is not the time. Moreover, charging by the number of times is actually not in line with the habits of the Chinese people and cannot be implemented. Therefore, we especially put forward this protest. Please consider it. To the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, in recent years, the Guānghuá Petroleum Company of this port has found it difficult to compete with foreign petroleum merchants due to the global economic recession. There was once a proposal to request nationalization. The Ministry of Industry sent Huáng Jīntāo, Director of the Industry Department, to Shanghai to investigate the company's assets. He returned to Beijing the night before last. According to the company's chairman, Xǔ Shìyīng, the company's total assets exceed 20 million yuan. If it is to be nationalized, it would require at least 10 million yuan. At a time when the national treasury is strained, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve this in the short term. However, detailed plans are currently under discussion, and whether it will be nationalized depends on the future negotiations between the two parties.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Yellow Mountain Construction Committee Emphasizes Protecting the Natural State of Yellow Mountain; Obtaining Permission Required for Specimen Collection and Engraving Inscriptions <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Office of the Yellow Mountain Construction Committee, the Yellow Mountain Construction Committee recently sent a letter to Commissioner Shí Dānshēng of Xiūníng and Shí Tǎi Counties in Anhui Province, stating that Yellow Mountain is a scenic spot renowned in the southeast. With the construction of facilities, there are more and more tourists. It should be strongly protected. As for Ganoderma lucidum, precious flowers, rare birds, exotic animals, and unique local products, they are all precious and should be carefully protected. Arbitrary destruction is not allowed. If specimens are indeed collected for research purposes, the permission of the on-mountain office must be obtained in advance before collecting them. In this way, contribution can be made, and maintenance is also intended. In addition, literati and poets may be moved by the scenery and engrave inscriptions on the sand and rocks. This can be unrestricted. However, there are endless tourists and limited space. Although it is said to be beautiful, it is still considered too much. Therefore, all poems and inscriptions that must be engraved must first be submitted to the office for consideration and determination of the location to show caution. As for mountain villas and guesthouses, the extraction of rocks for construction needs, all within the mountain area, must also obtain permission and guidance from the office to avoid destroying the natural environment and preserving the original appearance. Furthermore, mountain pines are raised everywhere to embellish the scenery. All seedlings and large trees should be preserved uniformly and strictly prohibit felling.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Fire at a Prostitute Brothel on Fújiàn Road; One Prostitute and a Customer Injured Jumping from Window; Fire Burns for Two Hours, Causing Significant Losses <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The sub-landlord of the house at No. 18, Lane 112, Fújiàn Road in the Public Concession is the concubine of Fù Ruìróng, manager of the Lèqún Hotel on Húběi Road and Guǎngdōng Road. Most of the house is rented to several prostitute brothels. At around 4:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out downstairs in the house. The entire house was shocked and in chaos. A group of prostitutes fled with their customers. However, the fire was fierce and the staircase was burned down in an instant. One Yangzhou prostitute named Lǐ Lǎosì, 18 years old, and a customer named Lín Fèngyì, a 23-year-old from Húběi, were sleeping soundly under the covers. When they woke up to the alarm, they put on their clothes and got out of bed. They saw that the ladder had been burned down. They rushed out of the fire pit, pushed open the upstairs window, and jumped down, injuring their backs, arms, heads, and waists. They were taken to Rénjì Hospital by firefighters. The flames spread to the neighboring houses at Nos. 16, 20, 22, 24, and 26, which were all reduced to ashes. The front building of Nos. 30 and 32 was slightly damaged. No. 30 is a warehouse of the Ruìshèng Woolen Company. Ten pieces of woolen fabric were burned, resulting in significant losses. In the end, seven houses were burned down. When the fire was raging, the Central Fire Brigade quickly dispatched several hose wagons to the scene to put out the fire. It took more than two hours to stop. After being notified, the police in charge immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene and tried their best to maintain order to ensure stability. After the incident, the detectives summoned Fù's concubine to the Lǎozhá Police Station to inquire about the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Record of the Great Fire at Tiándù Road, East of Xiǎoyángjīng Temple, Pǔdōng; Hundreds of Straw and Tile Houses Destroyed; Over Seventy Pigs and Coffins Burned to Death; Jiǎng Āfā Confesses Cause of Fire <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>At around 11:15 AM yesterday, a wood shop opened by local Jiǎng Āfā at No. 1, Tiándù Road, east of Xiǎoyángjīng Temple on Lànnídù, Pǔdōng, suddenly caught fire in the woodpile behind the house. Because the wood was dry and flammable, by the time it was noticed, it was out of control. The flames shot high into the sky, and with the help of the strong north wind, the fire quickly spread in all directions, causing the surrounding woodpiles to catch fire one after another, and the wood shop's houses were also engulfed in the fire.</p>
<p>The intensity was so great that it could not be approached. Upon hearing the alarm, the Pǔdōng District Fire Brigade, led by Director Zhào Lóngshēng, drove to the scene to put out the fire. After a while, Pān Guāngqǐ and others from the Yángjīng District Fire Brigade also drove to the scene to assist. However, the entrance to the wood shop was a small creek. There were several acres of open space on the south side of the creek. Since Xīngyè Trust Company built new houses in the Shìfànlǐ neighborhood last year on the open space next to Dōngchāng Road Shàntáng Road on the south side, most of the shacks erected on the open space have been moved here, totaling more than one hundred. At that time,</p>
<p>fire sparks flew out from the wood shop and drifted south with the wind, falling on the roofs of the straw shacks, causing the straw shacks to catch fire everywhere, making the firefighters unable to attend to everything at once and exhausted. Zhāng Míngqīn, Director of the Pǔdōng Public Security Sub-bureau, believed that the shack dwellers were all from Jiāngběi, supporting the old and carrying the young, and grabbing their belongings, which was quite chaotic. Therefore, he immediately ordered Commissioner Cài and Inspector Liú to lead many policemen to the scene to suppress the situation and persuade the onlookers to gather on the roadside, so that the disaster victims</p>
<p>could easily move in and out. At the same time, Teams 2 and 3 of the Yángjīng District Security Corps also dispatched members to the scene to maintain order. The firefighters poured water for about an hour, and except for a few dozen straw shacks on the west side of the creek, the rest of the straw shacks were reduced to ashes. The speed of the fire was shocking. The houses and woodpiles in the wood shop were also completely reduced to ashes. The firefighters stopped watering at around 5:00 PM because the inside of the fire site was still burning. In this operation, a total of six or seven woodpiles were burned, with a loss of about 600 yuan.</p>
<p>The wood shop's three tile houses were worth about 500 yuan. Ninety-four straw houses of various sizes south of the creek were lost, with a loss of more than 2,000 yuan. More than a dozen piglets raised by Lǐ Zǐlán and Zhū Shèng from Gāoyóu, who were engaged in pig farming, were burned to death, along with property. The total loss was approximately 4,000 yuan. Seven or eight coffins placed near the straw shacks were also burned, including one coffin with the body and clothes,</p>
<p>not yet rotten. Onlookers learned that the coffin had been placed for seven or eight years, so they gathered to watch and marveled. Some even suspected that the body was about to become a zombie. After the fire was extinguished, Director Zhāng ordered the police to take the fire starter, Jiǎng Āfā, to the bureau for interrogation to find out the cause of the disaster. According to Jiǎng's confession, he was 34 years old, a local, and had been running the wood shop for five years. The cause of the fire was that sparks from the chimney fell into the woodpile when cooking at home,</p>
<p>causing a prairie fire. He was ordered to wait for further interrogation. After reporters investigated the scene of the disaster, there were a total of four landlords, including Zhāng Lóngbǎo, Lù Jīnfǎ, Zhāng Fùlín, and the brothers Zhāng Shíshēng and Zhāng Hǎijīn, who rented out the land to the households to build shacks. The disaster victims included Wú Cháozhū, Chén Yín Dà, Yáo Guózhǒng, Zhū Dàkuí, Chén Zhàoyú, Xú Zhèngguì, Zhāng Bǎoqún, Wú Jiǔmíng, Gān Měigāo, Wū Yǒngquán, Lín Bìliáng, Yán Wànfú, Zhū Xiǎoshān, Chén Fùshān, Tāng Dàniú, Zhū Jiǔcái, Xiǎo Lóngzi, Chén Xiànsī,</p>
<p>Chén Xiǎo Èrzi, Liú Wànxiáng, Shā Chánglè, Chén Zhàoxiáng, Lǐ Hóngcái, Yáo Hèbīn, Dà Dāizi, Fàn Chūnyáng, Zhū Chángshēng, Huáng Xuézhú, Lín Yǒngróng, Xiāo Huáxiáng, Miù Guìhuá, Miù Guìzōng, Sānliánzi, Zhū Bǐnglián, Chén Zhàohóng, Chén Xīnnián, Lǐ Zǐgāo, Zhū Shèng, Yán Wénhàn, Liú Wànfā, Jì Hóngcái, Chén Xuānlián, Yáo Yīng, Wáng Róng, Wú Xī Sān, and other forty households. Zhāng Qīnggēn, Director of the Pǔdōng Branch of the Youth Association, specially took several photos of the disaster situation to ask philanthropists to provide relief to the victims.</p>

<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, Lǐ Jùnqīng, a policeman from the Tiāntóng Road Police Station of the Línpíng Road Police Station in Zháběi, was on duty at his post near Hújiāmù Bridge when he saw a young man riding an unlicensed bicycle speeding past. The policeman shouted for him to stop, but he did not respond, so he chased after him to Shājīnggǎng Road. The policeman accidentally stepped on a banana peel, fell to the ground, and died due to internal injuries. After the police officer from the other post arrived, he sent Li to Tóngrén Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The police station immediately ordered the bailiff Li Āyī to report to the local court and asked for an autopsy. In the morning, Prosecutor Lǐ Fēn and Coroner Shěn of the prosecutor's office went to Tóngrénjì Hospital for an autopsy and determined that he had died from internal injuries caused by the fall. The police station was instructed to take charge of the funeral arrangements. At the same time, the police station investigated and detained the young man riding the bicycle and will verify it.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Autopsy of a Thief Shot and Killed on Huánlóng Road; Released from Prison After a Previous Theft Case; Several Stolen Items Found <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The home of Yáo Cǎipíng, a native of Chángzhōu, at No. 6, Zhìfēng Alley, Lane 88, Huánlóng Road, French Concession, had a thief break into the second-floor room at 7:45 the night before last. Yáo's son, Shūmǐn, returned home from outside and saw the light in the upstairs room flickering. The father and son went upstairs to check. The thief, feeling guilty, fled and climbed onto the wall between Nos. 8 and 9. The homeowner shouted to catch the thief, which attracted many residents in the alley. Coincidentally, Zheng Bǎozhāng (22 years old, from Tiānjīn), a Chinese policeman from Team 626 of the French Police Station, was passing by. He heard the shout and entered the alley to arrest the thief. He fired a shot, killing the thief. The Central Police Station was notified and sent someone to transport the body to the autopsy room to await an autopsy. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after the incident, the French Police Station sent detectives to investigate the thief, who was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers and a black copper basin hat. He was shot in the right breast. The bullet did not exit. The police station sent officers to take photos at the scene and print the deceased's fingerprints. It was found that the deceased was Wáng Jīnshēng, 36 years old, from Pǔdōng. He had previously committed the same theft and was handled by the Second Special Court last month. He had been released from prison not long ago. At that time, the detective found a pair of children's leather shoes, several silk scarves, and a captain's license issued by the Yuǎnběi City Security Corps of Nánhuì County in 1929. A package of stolen goods was also found on the balcony of the homeowner's house, including several pieces of clothing and a pair of black leather shoes. At 11:00 yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wáng Rèn, forensic doctor, clerk, and others came to the station to examine the body. According to the detective's report on the case, the homeowner Yáo Cǎipíng stated that his home had also been robbed of 180 yuan in cash and gold jewelry in July. Last night, his son discovered the robbery upon returning home. He and his son went upstairs to check, and the thief fled out the door. The drawers in the room had been ransacked. He went to the balcony and saw the thief climbing the wall, crossing to Nos. 7, 8, and finally to the wall of No. 9. They shouted to catch the thief, and the patrolmen came. Then they heard a gunshot. They hid in the room. They didn't know what happened later. Zheng Bǎozhāng, a Chinese policeman from Team 626, stated that he heard the shout and entered the alley. He saw the deceased climbing on the wall, with his right hand reaching into his pocket, as if he was feeling for a gun. So he fired a shot. Later, the police station sent detectives to investigate and search the deceased's body. Prosecutor Wáng verified the confession and ruled that Wáng Jīnshēng had died from a gunshot wound. The body was handed over to the Tóngrén Fǔyuántáng for photographing and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Municipal Federation Requests Various Organizations to Respond to the Banning of Dance Halls and Urges the Authorities to Strictly Enforce It <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dàgōng News Agency, the Municipal Federation of Citizens of the First Special District believes that the abnormal development of dance halls in this city attracts young men and women to sing and dance wildly all night long, which wears away their ambitions and harms society deeply. It specially requested the municipal government and wrote to the Municipal Council some days ago, asking them to strictly ban it. Yesterday, it also sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Association, the Women's Association, and the Municipal Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District, asking them to unanimously advocate and urge the authorities to quickly and strictly enforce the ban. The original letter said: We are writing to you to inform you that at a time when our country's rural areas are bankrupt, commerce is declining, and people are struggling to make a living, the business of dance halls in this city has developed abnormally, singing and dancing wildly all night long, causing good young people to wear away their ambitions. At a time when international relations are deepening, patriotic young people should be especially vigilant and work together to overcome the national crisis. Instead, they are still singing and dancing wildly, which is enough to make foreigners laugh at them. After deliberation at the standing committee meeting of our association, we have requested the municipal government and written to the Municipal Council to request a ban. We have always admired your association as the leader of Shanghai's society. For businesses that affect society and harm the country, you should jointly advocate and urge the authorities to quickly and strictly enforce them in order to save good customs. If our humble opinions can be adopted, we would be grateful. Accordingly, we are writing to inform you, hoping you will take note.</p>

<p>Qian Zhenzhen, 54 years old, from Changshu, lived at No. 763 Zhoujiazuilu. On the 6th, his niece-granddaughter Wang Qian went to Ningbo for leisure. The jewelry such as gold bracelets and rings she was wearing attracted the attention of robbers. At about 5:00 PM that afternoon, Qian and others were having dinner at home when two robbers suddenly broke in, warning them not to make a sound. One robber tried to snatch the gold jewelry from Wang Qian's hand. Qian bravely stepped forward and grabbed the robber, shouting loudly for help. Another robber, seeing this and panicking, shot at Qian, hitting a vital spot. Qian fell to the ground. Qian Xiao, Qian's niece-in-law, who was nearby, was also injured in the leg by a stray bullet. The two robbers, realizing they had caused trouble, fled and disappeared. Upon the arrival of the police after being notified, the Huishan Police Station ordered detectives Li Zhaogen and others to investigate. They sent the injured Qian Zhenzhen and Qian Xiao to Tongren and other hospitals. Unfortunately, Qian Zhenzhen's abdominal wound was too severe, and he died at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. His body was taken to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, was appointed to perform the autopsy. According to the head of the Western patrol, Philip, who explained the situation, Wang Qian stated that she was 18 years old and lived on Donghan Bili Road. She had gone to her mother's house for a visit the day before. While they were having dinner, two robbers broke in. One had a pistol, and the robber without the pistol tried to snatch her gold bracelets and rings. Her uncle stood up and grabbed the robber, and she fled into the inner room. She heard the robbers fire five shots. Qian Xiao was her mother and was now injured in the leg. After hearing the statement, Guo concluded that Qian Zhenzhen, a male, had indeed died from a gunshot wound to the abdomen inflicted by robbers. The police station was ordered to strictly arrest the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice. The body was handed over to Qian Dingming, the deceased's nephew-grandson, who signed a guarantee for the coffin and burial.</p>

<p>The pathological autopsy of Mr. Ge Gongzhen's body has been completed after a detailed examination by Ai Shiguang, Associate Professor of Pathology at the National Shanghai Medical College. The college issued a report yesterday detailing the findings. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Case Report of Ge Gongzhen</p>
<p>Name: Ge Gongzhen, Gender: Male, Age: 46, Nationality: Chinese, Occupation: Journalist, Hospital Admission Number: 393 at Hongqiao Sanitarium, Date of Death: 2:00 PM, October 22, 1935, Date of Autopsy: 3:15 PM, October 22, 1935.</p>
<p>(A) Summary of Clinical History</p>
<p>Date of Admission: October 20, 1935. According to the patient, he returned to China from Soviet Russia, arriving in Shanghai on October 15. He felt very tired en route. After arriving in Shanghai, the patient experienced chills and cold sweats several times. Although he took aspirin tablets and had hot baths, he still felt like he was developing a severe cold. He stayed at the Xinya Hotel for two days, where he was bitten by mosquitoes several times. After the onset of symptoms, he did not feel pain in any part of his body. Friends noticed that his face was pale and advised him to rest and receive treatment at the Hongqiao Sanitarium. The patient's past medical history was not inquired into in detail, but the patient recalled having purple urine several times in Lushun (on the way back). He did not feel pain or notice any odor during urination. Upon admission, Dr. Liang found his body temperature to be 37.3 degrees Celsius, pulse 90 beats per minute, and respiration 25 breaths per minute. His skin was pale, lips dry, tongue slightly coated, and throat normal. His abdomen was flat and soft, without pain or tenderness. An X-ray examination of his chest showed a slight lesion in the upper left part. Four hours after admission, his temperature rose to 39.6 degrees. The next morning, blood tests showed no signs of blood parasites, but his white blood cell count was elevated at 10,600. Due to the X-ray report, Dr. Liu Deqi was consulted. At this time (October 21), tenderness was found in the lower right abdomen, so Dr. Dong was consulted. That afternoon, Dr. Dong found the patient to be restless, with abdominal wall movement during respiration. Obvious tenderness and abdominal wall muscle spasm were present in the lower right abdomen, but no mass could be palpated. A rectal examination also revealed tenderness on the right side. At that time, the white blood cell count was 13,000, with the most significant increase in neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Another examination was performed at 4:00 PM that afternoon, and the symptoms were the same as before, but more pronounced. Therefore, Dr. Dong, to prevent the spread of the disease, advised the patient's family to undergo an appendectomy immediately. With the family's consent, surgery was performed that afternoon at 5:28 PM under spinal anesthesia, with Dr. Liang as the assistant and Dr. Zhou as the observer. When the abdomen was opened, the muscle layer of the abdominal wall showed obvious edema, and the peritoneal surface was dark. A large amount of yellow watery pus was found in the abdominal cavity. The fluid was removed and sent to the First Hospital of the Red Cross for culture. The outer membrane of the appendix was found to be congested and covered with pus. It was removed, and after examination of the other parts, a drainage tube was placed in the abdominal wall incision, and the abdominal wall was sutured. The surgery lasted only ten minutes from beginning to end. The patient's condition was the same when he left the operating room as when he entered. After the surgery, 2,000 cc of saline solution was injected subcutaneously. The next morning, the patient's blood was taken for culture. At this time, the bacterial test report arrived, stating that hemolytic streptococcus was detected in the abdominal cavity fluid. Streptococcal serum was immediately injected, along with sugar water and saline solution. Cold compresses and cardiac stimulants were also used, but all were ineffective. The patient's breathing stopped at 2:00 PM on October 22, 1935. Clinical diagnoses: septicemia (hemolytic streptococcus), acute peritonitis (hemolytic streptococcus), acute periappendicitis, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, upper left lung lesion.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Murder and Robbery Case: Two More Accomplices Apprehended <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>A Request to Transfer the Case to the Second Special Court for Joint Trial of the Two Accomplices</p>
<p>Zhang Juyang, Chen Buzhao, and Shi Jinzhu, residing at No. 70, Lane 2125, Yangshupu Road, made a living by lending money and collecting interest. On the morning of May 27th this year, at 9:45 AM, six or seven robbers, armed with weapons, suddenly broke into their residence, intimidated them with inspection warrants, and robbed Zhang Juyang of 200 silver dollars, as well as Mrs. Zhang's gold rings and hairpins. As they fled, they fired several shots from their pistols, fatally wounding Chen Buzhao, and seriously injuring Zhang and Shi. Upon receiving the alarm, the local police dispatched detectives, but the robbers had already escaped. The injured were transported to Juxin Hospital for treatment, and the deceased was taken to the coroner's office for examination. Subsequently, the French police apprehended the robbers Liu Yulong, Chen Bao, Lin Changgen, and Tang Bingguang, and transferred them to the Second Special Court. After interrogation, it was determined that Liu and the other three were involved in the robbery and murder case at Zhang Juyang's residence. They were then transferred to the Public Concession Police, who sent them to the First Special Court for trial and sentencing. However, Lin Changgen died in the hospital due to illness. Now, Huatan Chang Shangwu of the Huishi Police Station apprehended two more suspects, Wang Jincai (also known as Yi Quan or Li Si) and Wang Fu, at a hotel located at No. 979, Haining Road, on the afternoon before yesterday at approximately 5 PM. They were brought back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, filed charges of murder and attempted robbery, stating that the defendants not only went to rob the victims but also intentionally committed murder. After obtaining the loot, the robbers forced Zhang Juyang, Chen Buzhao, and Shi Jinzhu to stand facing the wall and fired seven or eight shots at them, killing Chen Buzhao on the spot and seriously wounding Zhang and Shi, who had to undergo lengthy treatment at Sacred Heart Hospital before recovering. According to the statements made by the two defendants at the police station, Gu Lanyu initiated the robbery, and a total of seven people participated. Gu owned the pistol. After the incident, Wang Jincai received eleven silver dollars, a raincoat, and a robe. The raincoat was pawned in Zhabei, and Wang was still wearing the robe. Wang Fu received nine silver dollars and twenty-four double-horn coins. The defendants requested a postponement of the case and requested that a document be sent to the Second Special Court to transfer the already convicted accomplices Liu Yulong and Tang Bingyuan for cross-examination. Wang Jincai confessed that he was misled by Gu Lanyu, as someone nicknamed "Little Guanzi" had a grudge against the victims and offered Gu 200 silver dollars to take revenge. Gu pocketed the 200 dollars and did not mention revenge. Instead, he gathered Wang and others, including Liu Laosan, Little Guangdong (Tang Bingguang), Liu Yulong, and Ma Jinbiao, seven people in total, to rob them. Gu brought the pistol from the countryside, and Wang did not enter the house. He only heard two gunshots and fled. According to Zhang Juyang's complaint about the robbery, Chang Ting pointed out that Wang Jincai was present at the scene and fired a shot that hit his left shoulder, which he still hasn't been able to have removed. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the statements and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody pending further investigation and questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>The Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang is scheduled to open on November 12th. The Central Organization Committee dispatched Xie Chengyu and three others to Shanghai to handle the reception of overseas representatives. The reception office is located at the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. More than thirty overseas representatives have already returned to China and reported to Beijing.

<p>Mr. Yang Xingqin, a design committee member of the Central Organization Committee, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to negotiate important matters. Having completed his duties, he returned to Beijing by the overnight train last night. In discussions yesterday, he mentioned the selection of representatives from various provinces and cities for the upcoming Fifth National Congress, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the number of representatives elected by various provinces, cities, and railway party branches is 182, not 113 as reported in yesterday morning's paper, which was a recording error by the reporter.</p>

<p>Wang Yansong Scheduled to Depart for Beijing Tomorrow</p>
<p>With the Fifth National Congress about to open, the central authorities are busy with preparations and arrangements. Representatives from various regions are departing for Beijing one after another to participate. The representatives from this city, including Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Tao Baichuan, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Liu Weichi, Long Tiyao, and Zhang Guoyuan, were elected on June 1, 1933. At that time, the Central Committee sent member Hong Ludong to oversee the election. They were originally representatives for the Provisional National Congress, but due to circumstances, the Provisional National Congress was suspended. Therefore, the central government ordered that the representatives for the Provisional National Congress be changed to representatives for the Fifth National Congress. It was initially scheduled to open the Fifth National Congress on November 12th last year, but at that time, the suppression of bandits was at its peak. Some representatives were deeply involved in military operations to suppress bandits and found it difficult to attend. This led to the postponement to November 12th this year. It is now reported that all representatives from this city, except for Wang Yansong, who must travel to Beijing tomorrow (the 10th) due to business, have already arrived in Beijing one after another.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Zhendian, a prominent overseas Chinese figure from Singapore, has resided overseas for decades. In the past, he vigorously supported Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.

<h3 id="e110">China and Jiaotong Banks Commit to a Silkworm Seed Loan of 150,000 Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>China Bank 100,000, Jiaotong Bank 50,000; Contract to be Signed Once Collateral is Confirmed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department's Silkworm Silk Control Committee, based on reports from various counties regarding the need for improved silkworm seeds for next spring, which is estimated to be about 1.3 million sheets, is preparing to order 1 million sheets of silkworm seeds from Zhenjiang, Hushuguan, Wuxi, Suzhou, and various silkworm seed farms in Zhejiang Province. If the supply is still insufficient, another 200,000 to 300,000 sheets of Italian silkworm seeds will be ordered from overseas to meet the needs of silkworm farmers. The required funds are difficult to raise because the provincial treasury is depleted. It is impossible to raise the funds in a short time without borrowing from banks. Therefore, the Silkworm Control Committee sent Secretary-General Wang Guohua to Shanghai to negotiate a silkworm seed loan of 300,000 yuan with the China and Jiaotong Banks, which will be fully repaid when the raw silk is sold next spring. According to sources in Shanghai's banking industry yesterday, the China and Jiaotong Banks, after negotiations with Director Wang, believe that the Silkworm Control Committee has an excellent credit history with past loans. Furthermore, the matter concerns assisting the revival of the silk industry in rural areas, so even though credit is tight these days, they have expressed their support. The China and Jiaotong Banks have now agreed to lend 150,000 yuan, with China Bank lending 100,000 yuan and Jiaotong Bank lending 50,000 yuan. The interest rate is between 7 and 8%, and the principal and interest are due by the end of April 25th. Director Wang has returned to Hangzhou to report that negotiations are on track. Once the Silkworm Control Committee submits the appropriate collateral, a formal contract will be signed with the county government.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Records of Relief Efforts by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The fundraising department of the China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, located at No. 505 Henan Road, recently received donations from the Chinese Red Cross Society, including 40,000 silver dollars, 8,000 bags of flour, 10,000 articles of clothing, and 20 boxes of epidemic prevention medicine, to be distributed equally to the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, and Jiangsu. After receiving the donations, the committee has already remitted them to the respective provincial branches for distribution, except for Jiangsu Province, which is still awaiting allocation. In addition, clothing, hats, shoes, socks, quilts, medicines, and other items donated by major philanthropists in this city have also been transported to Jining, Shandong, for relief efforts. As the weather is gradually getting colder and winter is approaching, the survivors of the disaster will be spared from the risk of freezing thanks to these donations. Currently, donations continue to be received from various ports within and outside China, as well as from major benefactors among overseas Chinese, and are being remitted to the committee. For example, the Soenda Archipel Chinese Committee for the Relief of Disaster Victims in the Motherland remitted 1,400 national currency. The Shanghai General Branch of the Chinese Christian Youth Association and the staff of the Huxi Public Advocacy, Pudong New Village, and other organizations, as well as teachers, students, and workers from the Brain Gym, jointly donated 671.53 silver dollars (including 216.05 yuan donated as the Xie An Dao Memorial Fund). Furthermore, Mr. Peng Kaixu, an engineer from the Longhua Shanghai Cement Factory, also solicited donations from his colleagues, raising a total of 107 silver dollars on behalf of the committee. It is also worth noting that the students of the Jixi Feier Lu Jue Min Elementary School saved their snack money to donate to disaster relief. The school's principal, Ms. Ni Fengmei, specially encouraged them, raising a total of 80 silver dollars. The principal's concern for the public good and the students' generosity are commendable. Recently, the committee also received a cable from the secretariat of the "Chinese Disaster Relief Association" in New York, stating that the board of directors had decided to assist the committee in holding a fundraising campaign in the United States to relieve disaster victims in China. This is truly good news for disaster victims and further demonstrates the deep trust that people at home and abroad have in the committee.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper on November 倕, regarding the record of Chairman Chen's talks in Fujian Province, there are some errors in it: 1. There is no World Bank in Fujian. 2. Chairman Chen's trip to Taiwan last month was purely to visit the Expo and inspect various construction projects. The report in your newspaper that "because there were disturbances in Taiwan, he took the opportunity to contact the Taiwan authorities" is incorrect. Chairman Chen did not say this. Please investigate and correct this, and please publish the original letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lu Linchang, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Government</p>

<h3 id="e123">Rubber Industry Tour Notes (Continued) – Zhengtai Rubber Factory – <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Liqi</p>
<p>Mr. Yang and Mr. Hong also told us about the factory's production and sales situation while leading us on the tour.</p>
<p>The factory's maximum production capacity is 600,000 pairs of Warrior athletic shoes, Wanli shoes, and rubber shoes per month. Due to the current market depression, production has been reduced to 450,000 pairs of shoes per month. The monthly sales of Warrior athletic shoes and Wanli shoes are 30,000 pairs each, and the monthly sales of Daxi brand rubber shoes are 30,000 dozen.</p>
<p>Regarding the factory's personnel, the two gentlemen also told us that the factory has more than 1,000 male and female workers, with more female workers than male workers. The highest monthly salary is more than 30 yuan, and the lowest is 12 yuan, with the amount of the salary determined by the level of skill. The workers are responsible for their own food and lodging. However, medical expenses are borne by the factory. The factory provides a school for the children of the workers, providing general education. As for female workers, they are allowed to rest for three weeks before and after childbirth without any deduction in salary, and the factory provides a breastfeeding room for female workers to nurse their babies.</p>
<p>We only had a short time to visit the relatively complex rubber industry, so it is inevitable that we missed some observations regarding the production process. But after the visit, we have a thought that we would like to offer to the rubber industry. We believe that the past failures of the rubber industry were not only due to the soaring price of raw materials and the need to sell products at low prices due to the market depression. One of the reasons is that rubber manufacturers have focused on the manufacture of galoshes and athletic shoes. The more galoshes and athletic shoes that are manufactured, the more intense the competition becomes. The methods of competition are nothing more than improving products and reducing prices. The former is not easy to please customers, so everyone has to compete by cutting prices repeatedly, to the point where they cannot make a profit, and closures are often heard of. Therefore, we hope that rubber manufacturers will change their direction in the future and manufacture other products. For example, car tires were originally only produced by Chen Jiageng's company. After Chen's company closed down, domestic production disappeared and was entirely imported from England, the United States, and France, resulting in significant leakage. Now, with the increasing number of highways being opened to traffic, the demand for car tires is also increasing. We hope that rubber manufacturers can rise up and manufacture them themselves to stop the leakage. (Recently, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory has produced domestic car tires.) Other important products in the rubber industry include rickshaw tires, bicycle tires, hot water bottles, rubber bands, toys, and raincoats. Domestic production is still low, and most of the market is taken by foreign products. We also hope that rubber manufacturers can make efforts to produce in these areas, promote innovation, and break the psychological inertia of human causes, which may also be a way to save themselves.</p>

<p>Attending Members</p>
<p>Attendees included Section Chief Zeng from the Bureau of Education, Inspector Xie, expert Liao Maoru, and members Chen Jicheng, Tao Guangchuan, Shen Tilan, Cheng Kuanzheng, Jia Foru, Yan Zhenyu, Zhang Yi, Wu Zhiqian, Hu Changzhi, Tong Xingbai, Feng Yixian, Jin Yuezhang, Yan Junyi, Shen Tongyi, Tao ZaiGen, Huang Zaoxiong, Ma Jiazhen, Zhang Zaibo, Zhou Xianchu, and more than fifty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Section Chief Zeng reported briefly, stating that the research association in the previous semester was entrusted by the Ministry of Education and the research questions were also proposed by the Ministry. The results were quite satisfactory, and a special volume has already been compiled and distributed. This time, the research questions are freely proposed by each school, with no time limit, so they can be fully researched. Since the Bureau of Education solicited research questions from various schools, the schools enthusiastically proposed many, which have been compiled into a special issue. However, those received later have not yet been included and will be submitted for discussion next time. As for research methods, etc., please express your opinions.</p>
<p>Expert Opinion</p>
<p>Next, expert member Liao Maoru expressed his opinions, stating briefly that the results of the meeting convened by the Ministry of Education, which he attended last time, were quite similar to the results of the research conducted by this city in the previous semester, such as (1) reducing the amount of curriculum, grouping in high school, and adding vocational elective courses; (2) although the entrance examination issue was not formally discussed, there was a discussion session, and the entrance examination method may be changed next year, which is slightly the same as the research results of this city; (3) At the meeting, in view of the lack of contact in the national education sector, it was decided to organize a group similar to the National Education Association, which has close relations with research institutes in various places. There are many issues to discuss today, and it seems that group research is still a good idea.</p>
<p>Group Research</p>
<p>The method of group research was then discussed: (1) The issues are divided into five groups: curriculum teaching group, teacher training group, graduation entrance examination group, funding equipment group, and moral and military training group. (2) The members participating in the research of each group will still be handled in the same way as the previous session. New members and those who voluntarily transfer can immediately report to the Education Bureau by letter. (3) The conveners of each group are Liao Maoru, Chen Jicheng, Lin Meiyan, Zhang Yi, Shen Tong, etc. (6) The issues of curriculum teaching are determined to be studied by subject, and the research method is submitted to the curriculum teaching group for discussion.</p>

<p>Zhong Daozan, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, inspected education in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The day before yesterday (the 6th), he went to the Rural Education Department of the High School Department of Lida Academy in Nanxiang to conduct a detailed inspection of the department's educational facilities, student life, farms, experimental primary schools, rural clinics, etc. He believed that the department was run with a new experimental spirit and gave a brief speech to the students, saying, "The colleagues of the Ministry of Education have long paid close attention to the Lida Rural Education Department and have an imagination in their minds. Today, I came here and listened to Director Chen Fanyu and observed the actual situation. Everything is completely consistent with the previous imagination of the colleagues. Today, China's education has a new trend of adding education subjects to agricultural schools and agricultural subjects to normal schools. Colleagues believe that this emerging trend is not only enough to meet the needs of rural reconstruction in China, but also has its theoretical basis. At the previous National Vocational Education Conference, Fujian had a proposal to add agricultural subjects to normal schools. This new trend can be fully realized in the Lida Rural Education Department today, and it has a considerable spirit, which makes the colleagues feel very happy. The Rural Education Department integrates agriculture and education, and implements a semi-work and semi-study life. This education is completely a new experiment. The Ministry of Education also believes that schools with this experimental nature should be allowed to develop freely. If you work hard to study today, you will be the backbone of rural construction in the future."</p>

<p>He could only look up at her, his eyes full of gratitude, as he drank the wine she put to his lips, and then slowly ate the food she gave him. Each bite seemed to add to his courage, and soon he began to speak, as if eager to let her know everything about him.</p>
<p>She took out some gauze at random and asked, "Where have you been lately, Dan?"</p>
<p>"I ran away a month ago. Mr. Bhaer is a good man, but too strict. I couldn't stand it, so I left him immediately and went downstream with someone who was on his boat, so they don't know where I went. After I left that person, I worked for a farmer, but I hit his child, so the old man hit me, and then I had to run away and come here."</p>
<p>"Have you been walking all the way?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that man didn't give me any money, and I didn't want to ask him for it. Everything was offset by the incident of hitting that child," Dan smiled, but felt ashamed when he saw his tattered clothes and dirty hands.</p>

<p>— (Xian Zheng Sheng)</p>
<p>A pair of old-fashioned "thick" wooden chopsticks, held in the hand, doesn't require much force, a light twist and they "break." If you hold a large handful of "extremely thin" sandalwood chopsticks, then, no matter how much strength you use, you won't be able to "break" a single one. This is a clear lesson in "group cooperation" and "unity." Therefore, from the family to the nation, if opinions are "divergent" and people cannot "unite" as one, things will never go "well." As the saying goes: If the fence is tightly woven, stray dogs can't get in. Wise words! Strictly speaking: if men and women are truly "equal," then men can "remarry" one after another after their wives die, and women can of course "remarry" one after another after their husbands die. To take it a step further: men can visit brothels and have several "concubines," and women can of course visit brothels and have several "male courtesans (invented)."</p>

<p>— Shou Dong</p>
<p>Anecdotes about men of letters are known both at home and abroad. For example, the literary jokes of Japan also coincide with those of our country. I will record a few below to help the discussion.</p>
<p>The Japanese "Five Mountains Hall Poetry Talk" says: When Qibi was going down to the east, he passed through Qisu. He lost his way at night and stayed at a small house in the mountains. The owner greeted him warmly and talked to him. After going to bed, he heard someone whispering under the bed. Upon closer inspection, they were all mountain bandits who made a living by stealing. He felt terrified and couldn't sleep all night. The owner didn't dare to move either. The next morning, before leaving, he wrote a poem on the wall: "Staying overnight in a three-household village in the mountains, the heroes of the green forest are close to each other at night. Don't be surprised that I'm talking with my clothes open, I'm also a plagiarist of old books." When our country's Dr. Li She met bandits, the bandits knew he had a reputation as a poet and asked for his lyrics. She presented them with a poem: "Spring rain drizzles on the village on the river, the heroes of the green forest know each other at night. There's no need to avoid each other when we meet, half the world is like you today." The bandits were delighted with the poem and didn't take anything. Japanese man Zaozhouzi said, "It would be more appropriate to make 'half' 'more' in today's world." I said, I also use "all," which is closer to the truth, and even the author himself knows he can't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Qibi, whose real name was Ji and courtesy name was Decheng, also known as the Poetry Bull and Maxie, was from the foot of Mount Zantou in Sanqi, Japan. He was naturally intelligent and liked to make humorous remarks throughout his life. The "Five Mountains Hall Poetry Talk" also records Qibi's deeds. Qibi was at home, reciting poetry bitterly one night. His wife said: "Your groaning is so rapid, why are you so bitter? It's almost like when we are giving birth." Qibi laughed and said: "When you give birth, your belly has something in it; my belly is empty and has nothing in it, but I have to force out something extraordinary, so I can't help but be bitter."</p>
<p>"No matchmaker, the path is overgrown with weeds, since ancient times Yunlin has been far from the market. The only fair thing in the world is white hair, it has never spared the heads of noble people." This is a poem by Du Mu, and it is truly well said. A "One Night Talk" anecdote says: "In recent years, white hair has no fairness, it especially urges on the heads of sorrowful people." This is also good. The former Japanese Prime Minister Aihara Ichiyama had white hair from a young age. Was it because he was noble, or because he was sad? I tried to ask my white hair, but the white hair didn't answer. After listening to it, it seemed to say, "Like a first-class public official, it is definitely due to sorrow." The charm of the answer lies in its irrelevance.</p>

<p>— Han</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Guitang of the General Affairs Department's Taxation Department is the leader of the Chinese staff of the customs and also an outstanding talent in taxation. Recently, many improvements in customs administration have been due to Mr. Ding's planning. As a result, he is loved by his colleagues and admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Moreover, Mr. Ding is from Liaoning. He grieves the loss of his hometown, mourns the shrinking of the border, worries about the current difficulties, and is deeply troubled. Recently, after returning from a study tour of Europe and the United States, he felt that the world's catastrophe was approaching, the situation was becoming increasingly urgent, and when he looked back at the people in the country, they were still like sparrows living under the eaves, unaware that the nest would soon be overturned. He specially invited his comrades to advocate abandoning all hobbies and making plans to strengthen their willpower. He also did not aim too high, but took what was near at hand as the priority, and also considered that customs personnel often had many social events and unavoidable expenses. He should save unnecessary consumption and transfer it to useful expenses. In his public letter to his colleagues, he said that from now on, except for banquets for outside friends, for banquets for customs colleagues, it would be very good if they could prepare at home. Otherwise, they should prepare at the customs club, and the cost per table should not exceed ten yuan at most. Even if there are special reasons and it is necessary to set up a table in a restaurant, the cost per table should also be limited to this amount. The main thing is to be respectful and sincere, and not to be proud of extravagance and luxury. This measure is really to uphold the current difficulties and take care of our economic considerations. He is willing to set an example and also hopes to extend it to others. He still hopes that our colleagues will appreciate his sincerity, accept his humble opinions, promote frugality, and reverse the declining trend. It is heard that most of the staff of the General Taxation Department and the Jianghai Customs have signed to support the above circular, and anyone who has approved but still violates the above measures will be fined ten yuan, which will be transferred to charitable causes.</p>

<p>— Wu Yujun</p>
<p>The most important point of silver screen art is the thoroughness of expression. To play a certain role, one must portray the character's expression and behavior to the fullest extent. So-called "facial expressions" and "inner performance" must be combined to make the audience understand and applaud.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to create a successful movie star, because all kinds of expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness must be shown on the face in an instant according to the director's instructions, which is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Often, when we chat with a few friends, A says: "Performing in a play is the easiest and most casual with movies. It's not like other kinds of plays that require skills, stage steps, and voices. You can't come out on stage without practicing for a long time." B says: "Do you think it's easy to act in movies? Well, let me ask you to try it now. I want you to make an extremely sad expression within a minute, and even cry with tears." A acted for a long time, all he did was laugh, but he couldn't cry at all, let alone shed tears. From this point, it can be seen that acting in movies is really not easy."</p>
<p>However, we know that movies are made up of fragments and then connected together. In many places, it may be obtained from "techniques," and it can still hide clumsiness after all. There is some reason to say this.</p>
<p>This time, forty or fifty male and female stars of the Mingxing Film Company personally took to the stage to perform the play "Moon Bends" in this city and the capital. That is a blatant performance. Those who belittle the art of the silver screen can now know why these stars performed so well on the spot.</p>

<p>Yueying said with a wry smile: "You, Madam, how dare I be worthy of such a title as you address me? Ever since I came here, I have been confused. Although the food, drink, and clothing are all better than at my home, I always live here as if I am in a dream. Moreover, I am always thinking about my grandmother's health. The meat soup and boiled white noodles, such good things, when I eat them, I often don't know what they taste like." Madam Zhou smiled and said: "How do you say you often don't know what they taste like? Do they always cook noodles for you to eat?" Old Madam Zhu interjected from the bed: "It's a good thing to be able to eat noodles often." Madam Zhou supported her chin, thought for a while, and laughed: "I was reminded of a joke. I have a fellow villager who works on the Gansu Highway. He often lives in towns and villages. The landlord he borrows from is a small businessman, and his life is naturally very bitter. One day, he earned some extra money by helping with the highway project, and he bought several pounds of local yam noodles. He added salt to boiling water and cooked it for his family, and it was considered a treat. There were two children in his family, one five years old and one eight years old. From the time the water boiled in the pot, they stood straight, watching the noodles go into the pot, without leaving the stove for a step. Their mother felt sorry for the children, who were looking forward to it, so she served them a bowl of noodles first. Unexpectedly, the two children were still standing by the stove, holding chopsticks and bowls to eat. They weren't just eating into their mouths, they were simply pouring it into their stomachs. After eating one bowl, they ate another bowl. What do you think happened after the whole family didn't finish eating this meal?" (357)</p>

<p>This news was really beyond our expectations, and the Empress Dowager had a strange feeling. She couldn't wait to ask for the details of this matter immediately.</p>
<p>"So who is right and who is wrong between Japan and Russia after all? Do they suddenly start fighting like this, does it even count as a formal international war? I really don't understand why these foreigners always like to fight! There are many things that can be resolved peacefully, why must they fight each other and kill each other? I think they are simply born that way. Let's not care about these things for now, just ask how Japan and Russia started fighting this time?"</p>
<p>"Because Japan launched an attack on Lushunkou first."</p>
<p>"Are you talking about Lushunkou? That's really strange! Lushunkou is our seaport!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Empress Dowager."</p>
<p>"This is a very surprising thing! Since they want to fight, why don't they go to Japan to fight, or go to Siberia to fight? I think these two countries have very bad intentions towards us!"</p>
<p>"But, Empress Dowager, this war really has nothing to do with us!"</p>
<p>"How dare you say that? Since this war has nothing to do with us, then why are they fighting in Lushunkou?"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's sharp counter-question left the muddle-headed and useless Prince Qing speechless. In fact, he was not unable to distinguish these simple advantages and disadvantages. He also knew that the result of this battle between Japan and Russia in Lushunkou would definitely be harmful and not beneficial to China. However, those ministers were used to not telling the truth in everything, and they wanted to do their best to fool her about things that could be fooled, so Prince Qing also deliberately said this insincere lie.

<h3 id="e150">Dog Breeding Tips <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>1.  There are many kinds of dogs, more than 90 in the world. However, no matter what kind of dog, each has its own characteristics, that is, each has its own use. Among the practical dogs, there are seven kinds: guard dogs, hunting dogs, military dogs, police dogs, sheepdogs, racing dogs, and sled dogs. Guard dogs are best known for the British foxhound. Hunting dogs are best known for the West透炮隱得种. Military dogs are best known for the German species. Police dogs are best known for the British产勃拉特好姆特种. Other breeds, such as the Scottish Collie sheepdog and the British Creighton racing dog, are world-renowned. If we want to raise dogs, we should choose good breeds according to the purpose. The first method is to have pure breeds, understand the pedigree, and investigate the performance of their parents. The second is to raise medium-sized dogs at home, as small ones are mostly nervous and large ones are difficult to manage. Third, the temperament should be gentle, and fierce dogs are not easy to train. Fourth, it is best to buy them when they are two months old, as the temperament and habits of those who are one or two years old are not easy to change. Fifth, pay attention to whether they are healthy when buying. First check whether they have skin diseases, and then check their stools. Generally, the nose is wet and cold, the eyes are clear, the teeth are white, the ear roots are cool, the stools are dark yellow, or dark gray with yellow spots, and the body temperature is around 38 degrees. The pulse on the inside of the hind legs is around 80 beats per minute. If they have all kinds of conditions, then they can be considered healthy dogs. If the nose is dry, they have a cold, if they have a runny nose, they have a respiratory disease, if their eyes are congested with tears, their teeth are yellow and dirty, their ear roots are hot, and their body temperature and pulse are incorrect, then they are sick dogs. Also, amateurs don't know how to distinguish age, but they can generally judge by looking at the growth of the teeth. There are 42 canine teeth in total, and their arrangement order is: three front teeth, one canine tooth, four premolars, two molars on the upper jaw and three on the lower jaw, a total of ten on the upper jaw and eleven on the lower jaw. Milk teeth grow in two or three weeks after birth, front teeth grow in two to five months after birth, canine teeth grow in four to six months, and premolars and molars grow in five or six to seven or eight months. If we remember the appearance of the teeth growing, we can deduce its age. If all the teeth have grown, but the type is different, small dogs will be fully developed in one year, medium-sized dogs will take a year and a half, and Mastiff dogs in large dogs will take two years to mature. The estrus period of female dogs is generally in the two seasons of spring, about half a month. Male dogs do not have an estrus period. Female dogs that are usually quiet become very restless during estrus. Generally, the best time for mating is five or six days after the tide of red, and the conception rate will decrease after this. If conception does not occur once, the female dog will be in heat again after two or three weeks. If she is already pregnant, after three days, the female dog will dislike the male dog approaching her. The mammary glands gradually enlarge one and a half months after conception. Generally, they can be produced in sixty-two days. One or two days before delivery, the mother dog is nervous and looks very uneasy. Quickly replace the grass in the dog house with new ones. After delivery, first feed them clean, slightly warm water, and then feed them milk and raw eggs. Do not disturb them. Families with many children should be especially careful. On the second day, replace the soft grass, and knock the grass very softly with a wooden stick to avoid hurting the puppies. Puppies will open their eyes in about ten days. After delivery, the mother dog should be specially nourished to avoid insufficient milk.</p>

<p>— Jian Ling</p>
<p>Electron theory</p>
<p>According to the electron theory, the atoms that make up matter (matter) (atom are not indivisible. All atoms of matter are composed of positively charged nuclei (nucleus) and negatively charged electrons. Electrons are the smallest and indivisible thing contained in matter. The arrangement of the nucleus and electrons in the atom is similar to the "solar system with the sun as the center and the planets revolving around the sun." The nucleus is in the center, and the electrons are revolving around. An atom must have a certain number of electrons, revolving around the nucleus in a certain rule. Various atoms contain different numbers of electrons, and their nuclear structures are also different. The nucleus is composed of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. The number of protons must be greater than the number of electrons (referred to as electrons), so the nucleus must be positively charged. The electrons revolving around the nucleus are all negatively charged. The electrons commonly referred to are all negative electrons. In other words, electrons are the indivisible amount of negative electricity. No matter which atom they are contained in, electrons are all the same. According to the electron theory, an object is negatively charged, the number of electrons it contains must be greater than when it is uncharged; conversely, an object is positively charged, the number of electrons it contains must be less than when it is uncharged. Therefore, an object must be negatively charged when it receives external electrons; conversely, an object must be positively charged when it loses the electrons it contains. Ordinary objects are not charged because the positive electricity of the nucleus they contain is exactly equal to the negative electricity of the revolving electrons, in other words, the number of protons is exactly equal to the number of electrons, so it is neutral. Neutral objects have no electrical attraction or repulsion to other objects. If a certain behavior can destroy the neutralization of the object, in other words, it can destroy the balance between electrons and the nucleus, the electrons will be able to leave the object, and the effect can therefore occur.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Current <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Xin</p>
<p>Everyone knows the name "electric current," but what exactly is electric current? According to the theory of electrons, current is the continuous movement of electrons. Electrons flow from the cathode to the anode, forming an electric current. In a common solid, such as a copper wire, the atoms exchange electrons with each other in a chaotic manner, but the net change is zero because for every electron lost, one is gained. The result is as if no electrons moved. If a copper wire is placed in an electric field, for example, by connecting the two ends of a copper wire to the positive and negative terminals of a battery (the anode is also called the positive terminal, and the cathode is called the negative terminal), as shown in Figure 1, the negatively charged electrons are pushed towards the end connected to the anode because electrons are repelled by negative charges and attracted by positive charges. Therefore, electrons flow from the cathode, through the battery, and back to the anode. This is the current flowing through the copper wire. The magnitude of the current is closely related to the characteristics of the conductor (conductor) (copper wire is a type of conductor) and the strength of the electric field. A good conductor has low resistance and a strong electric field results in a large current. A poor conductor has high resistance and a weak electric field results in a small current.</p>
<p>An electron is an extremely small, indivisible particle inside an atom. If it were used to measure the magnitude of electric current, the numbers would be in the tens of thousands, which would be extremely inconvenient. Therefore, an ampere (ampere) is usually used as the unit of current. One milliampere (mili-ampere) is one-thousandth of an ampere; an even smaller unit is the microampere (micro-ampere), which is one-millionth of an ampere.</p>
<p>1 ampere = 1000 milliamperes</p>
<p>1 ampere = 1000000 microamperes</p>
<p>1 milliampere = 1000 microamperes</p>
<p>Readers may find the direction of electric current somewhat confusing. Before the theory of electrons was invented, the direction of electric current was defined as flowing from the anode through the conductor to the cathode, which is exactly the opposite of the above-mentioned flow from the cathode to the anode. This is not a contradiction. The former theory believed that electric current was positive charge flowing from the anode to the cathode, which has a slightly different concept of the nature of electricity. After the discovery of electrons, the nature of electricity was clarified, and electric current was definitively determined to be the flow of negative electrons. If the reader clearly understands that electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor from the cathode to the anode, then they will not be confused.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Electromotive Force and Voltage <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>As shown in the figure above, when a battery is connected to a copper wire, current flows through the copper wire. If the copper wire is disconnected from the battery, the circuit is broken, and there is no current in the copper wire. The battery causes current to flow through the copper wire because the battery maintains a certain voltage between its two terminals, which enables electrons to flow from the cathode through the conductor to the anode. This voltage is called electromotive force, and the unit of electromotive force is the volt. Common machines for generating electromotive force are generators (generator) and batteries (cell). Generators are divided into DC generators and AC generators. Batteries are also divided into dry cells (dry cell), storage batteries, air batteries, and various wet batteries. The voltage of a typical dry cell is 1.5 or 1.6 volts. When two dry cells are connected in series (inseries), connecting the anode of one battery to the cathode of the other battery, the voltage of these two dry cells in series (i.e., the voltage between points A and B in the diagram) is twice the voltage of one dry cell, hence 3.0 or 3.2 volts. Two or more batteries connected in series as in the second figure is called a battery (battery). The 6-volt A battery (A battery) used in ordinary radio receivers is three storage batteries (storage battey) connected in series. A single storage battery has a voltage of 2 volts. The B battery (Bbattery) is the sum of the voltages of many battery cells.</p>
<p>The third figure shows another type of battery, which is formed by connecting many batteries in parallel. That is, the anodes of each battery are connected together, and the cathodes are connected together separately, as shown in Figure 3. This is the connection method for three batteries in parallel. Parallel batteries have the same voltage (i.e., the voltage between points AB in Figure 3) as a single battery, but this parallel battery can supply a large amount of current.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Conductors and Insulators <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— En Yuan</p>
<p>What is a conductor? What is an insulator? Generally speaking, a substance that easily conducts electric current is a conductor, with very little resistance. A substance that does not easily conduct electric current is an insulator, with extremely high resistance. From an electron perspective, a substance whose electrons are relatively far from the nucleus, and easily transferred from one atom to another, that is, whose electrons are free electrons (free electrons), and easily flows, this substance is called a good conductor, such as copper, silver, aluminum, and other metals. Electrons do not easily transfer from one atom to another, we say that the conductor has a greater resistance. For example, mercury and iron have a greater resistance than copper and silver. As for electrons, that are close to the nucleus, and almost cannot escape from the atom, that is, whose electrons are bound electrons (bound electrons) that are bound by the nucleus, such a substance is extremely difficult to conduct electricity, which is called an insulator (insulator), also called a non-conductor (non-conductor), and sometimes called a dielectric (dielectric). For example, glass, rosin, mica (mica), air, sealing wax, silk, wool, rubber, porcelain, and dry wood are all good insulators.</p>
<p>The resistance of a substance is extremely related to the temperature of the object. Sometimes an object that is originally an insulator can become a conductor when the temperature rises to a very high level. The resistance of ordinary metal conductors increases with increasing temperature. However, the resistance of liquids and carbonaceous substances is exactly the opposite, decreasing with increasing temperature.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Types of Electrical Conduction <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Meng</p>
<p>In addition to using solid materials such as copper wire and aluminum for conductors, there are three other types of conduction used in radio applications that are very important to wireless science: (1) liquid conduction, (2) gas conduction, and (3) pure electron conduction in a vacuum, with the third method being the most important.</p>
<p>For liquid conduction, let's take the example of the conduction of a common salt solution (common salt). The chemical name of common salt is sodium chloride (sodium chloricde), which contains the two elements chlorine and sodium. When common salt is placed in water, forming a sodium chloride solution, each molecule of common salt is divided into two parts, one part is the nucleus of the sodium atom, and one part is the nucleus of the chlorine atom. These two parts are not true atoms because the sodium in the solution loses an electron, so it carries a positive charge, and the chlorine has an extra electron, so it carries a negative charge. These positively charged sodium and negatively charged chlorine in the solution are not the original atoms, so we call them ions (Ions). If we now connect the two terminals of a battery to two metal plates and place the metal plates in the salt solution, then the sodium ions will be attracted by the cathode plate and flow to the cathode plate. When the sodium ions reach the cathode plate, they gain one electron and neutralize, becoming ordinary sodium atoms. The chlorine ions are attracted to the anode plate, giving the extra electron to the anode plate, and the chlorine also becomes neutral chlorine atoms. This action continues as long as the battery circuit is not broken. This continuous action is the current passing through the liquid. We call this phenomenon electrolytic conduction (electrolytie conduction). Radio applications such as electrolytic rectifiers (electrolytic rectifier) use electrolytic conduction.</p>
<p>Gas conduction is also useful for radio machines. For example, supplying power to late-line machines also uses gaseous rectifiers (gaseous rectifier). The principle of gas conduction is slightly different from liquid conduction. Free-flowing electrons in the gas, due to their high speed, collide with the gas atoms, enough to make the electrons in the atoms escape from the nucleus. Thus, the number of free electrons increases with each collision. If they are attracted by the anode, they become electric current. For example, neon lamps (neon lamp) (electric lights used for signs and advertisements) use this principle. Neon bulbs contain two metal plates and are filled with neon gas. In addition to its molecules, neon gas also contains a small number of free electrons. If these two metal plates are connected to the two terminals of a battery, these few free electrons are attracted to the anode plate. Because the electric field of the anode is very large, the speed of the electrons is also very high. These high-speed electrons collide with the neon atoms, enough to make the electrons in the atoms leave the atoms, and the neon atoms that lose electrons become positive ions. These positive ions are attracted to the cathode, and obtain the electrons they need at the cathode to neutralize, and still become ordinary neon atoms. This phenomenon continues to occur. The result is that electrons continue to flow from the cathode to the anode, which is the electric current. Neon lamps emit very bright light, which is due to the recombination of neon positive ions with free electrons near the cathode.</p>
<p>The third type, pure electronic conduction in a vacuum (pureelcrronic conduction), is the most important use in radio science, because the vacuum tubes (vacuum lube) used in various radio machines apply this principle. Figure 5 shows the simplest two-electrode vacuum tube. The tube is a vacuum, with almost no gas present. The plate (plate), also called the anode, is a metal plate whose connection should be connected to the anode of the B battery. The filament (filament), also called the cathode, is a metal wire whose one end should be connected to the cathode of the B battery. The A battery is used to supply power to the filament, making it glow brightly, like an ordinary small light bulb. The filament gets hot and the temperature increases, so electrons are emitted from the filament. This is the emission of thermionic electrons (the,rmionic electron emission). The electrons are densest near the filament, and the farther away from the filament, the sparser the electrons. The electrons emitted by the filament are absorbed by the plate because the plate has a positive electric field. Some electrons also turn back, but the electrons that turn back are forced by the electrons gathered near the filament and still flow towards the anode. However, because the voltage of the anode is quite high, the speed of the electrons flowing to the anode is also very high, enough to cause a small number of electrons that have already reached the anode to be reflected back. However, the number of electrons that turn back is small compared to the number of electrons that reach the anode. This phenomenon of electrons reflected back from the anode is called secondary emission (secondary emission), and the reflected electrons are called secondary emission electrons.</p>

<p>Total turnover for the day was only over eight thousand taels, with chips reduced to nine thousand seven hundred and two. After a day of hovering at one price, it continued to drop by one yuan and nine jiao.</p>
<p>The gold market was even more stagnant yesterday. The price only fluctuated by three yuan throughout the day, and hovered at just a few jiao in the middle, an idle image rarely seen in recent years. The overall trend succumbed to the settlement price. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed a slight increase in London and stability in the US. Large traders said that after the market closed, there would be forward sales at the listed price. The forward silver price in Montedori also rose by five hao to one and a half li. Exchange rates were slightly higher, with the London pound rising by one penny. People's hearts were calm. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with both the US and UK remaining unchanged, and the Customs Gold Unit unchanged. The standard gold price was listed as 1150 yuan and 3 jiao. The morning opening was flat. After the opening, because major clients supplied eagerly, the 50 yuan level was difficult to maintain. Banks sold shillings and started to fall, but buyers saw the low price and maintained their position. Thereafter, the price hovered around eight yuan for a long time, with only a few jiao of fluctuations. The Bank of Japan slightly bought forward shillings, and Mobil also acquired US dollars, with a slight increase. Many parties took advantage of the high price to sell, but it was still difficult to change the situation. It was predicted that the price of Indian silver would be slightly higher by two annas. At noon, the overall trend was idle. In the afternoon, the market opened lower due to bank sales, but as the initial report of Indian silver was reduced by five annas and Bombay bought shillings, it slightly recovered. However, due to the scarcity of transactions, the fluctuations were even narrower. Banks slightly sold Indian silver, and then reduced it by another anna. As a result, the market price remained stagnant, and the market presented a cool image. There was no change at the close. The daily market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1150 yuan, a slight increase of one jiao compared to the previous close. Fuyu, Shunli, Richang, Dada, Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuan, Yongyi, Feng, Yongshen, and Shuzhi sold, and the price fell from 50 yuan and 1 jiao to 47 yuan and 4 jiao. Shanghai sold November shillings at 5625. Yongli Yuanyi Hongxing advanced to eight yuan, Fuxing Yongda Dai Yuanmao Yongchang sold to seven yuan and one jiao. Yongli Hengyu Yuanyi took advantage of the low price to buy in, rising to eight yuan and one jiao. It was predicted that HSBC's listing would be flat for both the UK and the US and remain unchanged. Yuqing Yongfu Xingyong sold, retreating to seven yuan and a half. Dingli Yongli Yifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Shang Na, rising to eight yuan. Yuqing Yongshen Feng limited the supply. Sheng Datongfu also sold, and then fell to seven yuan and three jiao. Qingfa Yongdeli Shunli Laijin, rising back to eight yuan and a half. The positive gold bought January shillings at 4375. However, Tong Taichang still sold at a high price, retreating to seven yuan and seven jiao. Indian silver was predicted to be two annas higher. Huixiang Lichang slightly bought in and remained peaceful. At noon, the price was 1148 yuan and 1 jiao. In the afternoon, the market opened at 1148 yuan and 3 jiao. Youli released November US dollars at 75. Yuxin Xiangfu Xingyong sold, retreating to anna, gradually rising to over eight yuan, reaching eight yuan and three jiao. Hengyu Shenfeng Yuanmao Yong sold, retreating to seven yuan and six jiao. Yongli Shangjin rose to eight yuan and one jiao. Indian silver was reduced by another anna. Fuxingyong provided taels, and then retreated to seven yuan and six jiao. Yifengyong took advantage of the low price to buy taels, and the market situation became even calmer. Extending to the close at 1148 yuan. The settlement price was determined by the Central Bank's standard gold, with the listed price rising to 150 yuan and 3 jiao. According to the closing price, it was approximately two yuan lower, approximately two yuan higher than the previous close. This month's relief bond was 1138 yuan, and December's was 1148 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1138 yuan, and the afternoon was the same price. The price of pure gold was reduced by three yuan to 1147 yuan. The spot market situation was peaceful. Tianjin goods were increased by one yuan and there were no transactions. Cooked pure gold was increased by two to three yuan and was bought by the spot firm Yingfeng Heng, totaling about two hundred taels. Finally, about five yuan was needed. The swap was given to Shengda by Yingfeng Heng yesterday for thirty-five taels, ten yuan.</p>
<p>The volume of transactions was even more sluggish, with a total of Yuanyi Hongxing Yuanmao Yongding Kang Futai Heng Shunmao Dachang Xiang Qingfa Yong Yifeng Yong Yongfeng Yong Fuxing Yong Fuyu Wanfeng Hengyu Shengda and others on the selling side, and Yuanmao Yongding Kang Shunmao Chunyuan Yong and others entering and exiting first. Richang Fuyu exited and entered first, and Wanfeng allocated two hundred and ten taels to Fuyu, priced at 48 yuan. Dalian's Wanxing had no transactions throughout the day. Shunli only had a small number of entries and exits in the morning, and the market was also quiet in the afternoon. Guangdong Hengxing was calm, and Shengda gave up.</p>
<p>The market situation was even more depressed in Tianjin, with the opening at 1150 yuan and the closing at 1148 yuan. The highest price was 1150 yuan and 1 jiao, and the lowest price was 1140 yuan and 1 jiao, with only three yuan of fluctuations.

<h3 id="e159">There is talk of credit lending revival <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>But it is inconvenient to lend as much as possible as the end of the year approaches.</p>
<p>Since the spring of this year, due to the sluggish market conditions, the Shanghai banking and financial industry has adopted a cautious policy, which has made it impossible for various businesses to operate. Thereafter, since the large-scale contraction at the end of April, the tightening has gradually increased, and by the end of the year, it has become particularly tense, with the image of only collecting and not lending. Since the Ministry of Finance reformed the new Bank of China note method, cash has been concentrated, and the financial chips have been able to increase, market liquidity can be activated, and the banking and financial industry has had surplus power to cope with the lending business. Therefore, from the day before yesterday, news of lending has been released one after another, but it is only for a part of solid banks and firms with solid old accounts. As for ordinary stores, they still cannot get considerable credit lending, so according to our intention, a little lending, although a drop in the bucket, is ultimately a small supplement to the vitality of the market. The market price of foreign dismantling remains unchanged from the previous day, with both the morning and afternoon markets at one jiao and six fen. Dismantling ticket transactions have also gradually increased, with over four million four hundred and forty thousand in the morning, over ninety thousand in new transactions, and over thirty thousand in afternoon transactions. The small General Association also has between five and six hundred thousand open. Also, pawned funds transactions yesterday also had between one million seven and eight hundred thousand to various industrial and commercial shops, generally with real estate and goods as collateral. As for adding water, with the current market atmosphere active and the tops abundant, there is no water to add. All are white lines. It is heard that there is a shortage of medicine money, and yesterday there was over ten million. Because foreign demand for loading banknotes has been very strong recently, yesterday another one hundred and twenty-three million continued to be loaded to the interior and various ports, and the local banking and financial industry and various foreign firms took out two hundred thousand banknotes. The news of bank collection and settlement yesterday was relatively flat, with foreign banks collecting and settling over one million six hundred thousand bills, various goods and remittance pawns collected and settled over three million one hundred thousand, electric remittance funds over fifty thousand, special remittance funds also over fifty thousand, and US dollars settled out over forty thousand, which were directly mortgaged to the central government. Chinese banks collected and settled over one million nine hundred thousand bills, various goods and remittance money collected and settled over three million four hundred thousand, electric remittance money over forty thousand, special remittance money over eighty thousand, difference money over one million three hundred and forty thousand.

<p>Closing Buying Enthusiasm Particularly Strong, Rising Trend Reemerges</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market shifted from a fatigued decline to an upward trend. Rumors gradually subsided, and most bullish investors actively took positions and then covered them. This was simply a reversal after excessive gains. As news shifted slightly, a rebound occurred. After the currency system reform, there was no connection to the rise and fall of public bonds. The increase was initially fueled by speculation, followed by suppression, a cyclical pattern. Yesterday, only three sessions were held, one in the morning. The downward trend had not abated. Northern traders and firms numbered 43, 14, and 18 showed considerable selling activity. Numbers 4 and 48 maintained strong buying interest. Gold shorts were pulled up significantly, while other market prices were slightly suppressed. However, the largest decline was in far-term salt tax, which fell by one yuan and one jiao and a half. In the afternoon session, initially, numbers 7 and 8 saw some selling, and the weak trend continued. They fell by another one jiao to one jiao and four fen. Zheng Liu and Jiu Liu salt taxes both recovered by three jiao and five fen. Towards the close, rumors circulated that bank deposit rates would be reduced. The earlier part of the day saw a flat and weak market. Starting from number 20, large firms such as 22, 32, 43, 48, 71, 72, and 78 all aggressively bought. Number 20 surged by five jiao and seven fen. The far-term salt tax even increased by one yuan and six jiao. A flying rise and upward trend is about to reemerge. The market results were as follows: Earlier issues were down by two or three jiao to one yuan and eight jiao for Disbandment bonds.

<p>The yarn market experienced morning declines and afternoon gains, with sudden rises and falls, making it difficult to predict. Initially, sales of spot yarn were sluggish, and selling prices trended downward. The price of thread fell particularly sharply. Confidence was shaken, and the market felt increasingly lax. In the afternoon, buyers became very active due to rising raw cotton prices. The supply tightened, and speculators aggressively covered their short positions. The market price then rebounded. However, actual demand remained extremely weak.</p>
<p>Jinji Covers Short Positions</p>
<p>The opening of the morning session for marked yarn saw slight increases in all months. However, the market situation did not show any signs of tightening.

As a result, each month's closing price was down five jiao to one yuan and four jiao and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market price suddenly rose sharply, and buying enthusiasm increased rapidly. The supply became scarce.

<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market opened with continuous increases in all months. Foreign wheat was quoted at around 24 jiao in Chicago and zero jiao in Canada. The market sentiment was that the source of wheat was not smooth, and domestic reserves were gradually depleting. The situation of current foreign wheat was that no one inquired about it during this chaotic time. Therefore, the minds of those inside and outside the industry turned old and hard again. Trading was very smooth in the morning, reaching over 700,000 bags, and the price increased by three or four fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the recent sentiment became even more bullish. The current month once reached 9 jiao and 8 fen. Later, factories slightly hedged, and the bullish side also took the opportunity to sell back, gradually easing off. Far-term offers were not abundant and remained firm. In terms of the environment, the people of the industry can relax when foreign wheat negotiations start.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat trading was not active, and the market remained in a narrow range. Outside investors were unable to become excessively active, partially due to financial reasons and partially because the market speculated that foreign wheat might be subject to tax reductions in the future due to concerns about food. Therefore, the buying was not smooth, and prices showed little change. However, the current foundation seemed firm, and it should be able to stand firm if there are no unexpected changes. The months compared showed very little change. Spot wheat was bid up by five fen due to good factory demand and insufficient arrivals. Medium and inferior qualities remained the same. Shandong Sizhou wheat opened at four yuan, eight jiao, and a half, Huaian wheat at four yuan, eight jiao, and three fen, Jiangbei wheat at four yuan, eight jiao, Liuhe wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, and four fen, Hankou wheat at four yuan, six jiao, and three fen, and Shaoxing wheat at four yuan and seven jiao.

<h3 id="e168">Rice Market in North and South Continues to Decline <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>More Than 400 Stored on the River</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply from various firms was nearly 60 (goods totaled more than 12,000 shi). Since the sales market turned sluggish the day before yesterday, yesterday the situation was particularly abnormal. In addition, arrivals have been strong for consecutive days, and the amount stored on the river has reached more than 400. Confidence was floating and empty, and the market situation immediately saw a downstream. Early-season new japonica rice fell by two or three jiao, while although the light new rice had nearly 1,000 bags purchased by Tianjin and Qingdao firms, the eating was harsh, causing a strange falling angle. Du Jian followed down by two or three jiao, foreign Jian fell by three or four jiao, barely breaking through to pass the order without distinction, while Yin Yuan also stepped down by two jiao or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) More than 50 ships arrived from various routes, and the number of ships accumulated on the river gradually thickened. The market saw each good's purchase power disappear. The new rice sales were sluggish in piecemeal, and the price fell by two or three jiao. The new light rice of the Bai Ge variety was slightly down by one or two jiao. There were continued transactions in Moubu Jian Linghua, with short prices slightly lower, about two jiao. In addition to the small price of Du Jian, the foreign Jian was soft, and the new Yin Bian Yuan was down by a small two jiao. All the remaining goods were also slightly lower by a jiao or so.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued to arrive, especially from Yongjiang, Wenzhou, Taiwan, and Jiangxi. There was also cargo en route from Hunan that could arrive. Sales were lower, and Northern firms were not reliable. Storing households were also not as active as in recent days, and only one firm in the same street continued to respond. However, the rumors subsided, and the quality has been expressed. The market has entered a semi-naked state. Therefore, all grades of high and secondary quality were uniformly lower by a jiao or so. Ningbo processed rice was slightly down by two jiao. Foreign rice was watched by the business community. The floating reserve has long dried up, and the future market does not seem to be looking down on Ke Xian. Foreign rice did not have any transactions throughout the day. It is estimated that Yong Rice opened at 1,400 bags, Gan Rice 2,500 bags, Tai Rice 135 bags, and Zhangzhou Rice New opened 100 bags, with the price at 11 yuan, three jiao, and nine fen. Northern firms purchased over 1,000 bags of Yong Rice, while the rest were purchased in three grades.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to strong foreign purchasing power, the market for foreign sesame rose again. The previous night, Paohe searched for and handled 1,100 tons, and the price went from 10 yuan and eight jiao to 10 yuan and nine jiao. The same was still ordered for future delivery. Yesterday morning, 300 tons were added, and the price still opened at 10 yuan and nine jiao. The outlook for the future is still unlikely to fade for the time being, based on the foreign sales market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be soft due to a decline in sales. The guild allocated 24 raw and white sand. Spot goods had some transactions at 21 yuan and nine jiao and a half, slightly lower by five fen. The transshipment price was six yuan and nine jiao, but no transactions were made. Cotton wool from the factories declined by corners and the proposed brands were as follows: No. 1 at 21 yuan and 1 jiao, No. 2 at 10 yuan and 9 jiao, No. 3 at 20 yuan and 6 jiao, No. 4 at 20 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, and No. 5 at 20 yuan, 3 jiao and a half. Jingye Cooperative Company marked down Huizhou medium-grade white sand at 2,680 bags, 20 yuan and 6 jiao, and assigned all of them to circulation. No transactions were made for all other cotton wool and Dutch raw white grades at original prices. A helping firm opened more than one hundred bags of Zhangdiaoqing goods at 11 yuan to 10 yuan and a half. No transactions were made for Dongchi Dongbai at the original prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, green tea prices were firm. The Luzhuang Zhenmei was in great demand from British merchants such as Jinlong, Xiehe, Baochang, and Yihe. Because the exchange rate has become increasingly stable after China's monetary reform, the value of goods when converted is the lowest it has been in more than ten years. Therefore, European sales have greatly increased. However, the market has begun to lack goods of the highest Zhuang grade. Yesterday, transactions in Zhenmei and Zhenmei needle goods of upper-middle Zhuang grades, as well as Hee Shrimp Eyes and other goods, totaled over 1,200 boxes. Prices were firm.</p>

<p>Military uniform yellow serge has seen very active purchases from Nanjing firms recently, because military, political, and academic circles have been continuously making large orders for clothing. The wide use for leggings has led Beijing clients to come and request purchases. The serge around two yuan is the most popular and suitable for sales. Goods priced at three or four yuan a yard also continue to be needed. The goods imported from Poland have seen major openings by trading companies. Domestic Zhanghua Haijing brands have also had considerable transactions, and sales prices are all up one or two jiao compared to ten days ago. Most must be paid in cash or Zhuang banknotes for delivery.</p>

<p>After the Tianjin and Qingdao companies madly rushed to purchase, the market for 26-inch 18-gauge black iron sheets is lacking. Recently, porcelain enamel factories and thermos manufacturers have also been madly purchasing, due to rising raw material prices. The bottom goods have been depleted, and confidence is even stronger. The market price has risen further to an estimated nine yuan and seven jiao and a half per bundle, which is two jiao and a half better than before.

<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Patients suffering from typhoid fever, dysentery, and other illnesses should avoid food residue. The intestinal walls are sensitive and easily irritated by the friction of undigested food, often leading to intestinal bleeding and worsening the condition.</p>
<p>During this time, patients should not only avoid rice, but also ordinary, slightly thick porridge. In other words, they should avoid rice grains altogether and only drink rice water or very thin porridge. Patients are less likely to feel hungry and can abstain from food. If they do feel hungry, they should eat liquid or easily digestible foods. Forcing oneself to eat more is not appropriate at this time.</p>
<p>When dealing with such patients, people often provide pickled cucumbers, purple ginger, and pickled radishes as side dishes, and eagerly hope they will progress from porridge to rice. Little do they know how misguided this is and how much harm it causes to the patient. Please pay attention.</p>

<p>— Physician Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>As winter approaches and the weather turns cold, all things tend to contract. It is most appropriate for people to nourish their bodies at this time.</p>
<p>However, the choice of tonics requires careful consideration. General tonics are often too sticky or too drying, and their efficacy is insufficient. They fail to address essence, blood, brain, and marrow. Based on our experiences, we believe that "Reproductive Hormones" endocrine preparations are the best choice. "Reproductive Hormones" can promote human metabolism. After taking it, it can bring the body's secretory functions into a healthy state, and it has the effect of replenishing blood, strengthening the brain, adding essence, and benefiting marrow. It is the only medicine that can both treat and nourish the common types of youth that suffer from nervous breakdown, post-illness dysregulation, developmental deficiencies, and qi and blood deficiencies. Therefore, "Reproductive Hormones" are promoted as the top choice for winter nourishment.</p>

<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Patient Wang Youlu, 22 years old, suffered from severe masturbation during his childhood, resulting in nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and a severely weakened youth gland. He had injections and oral tonics with little effect. Last autumn, he had about 20 nocturnal emissions per month and was physically exhausted. He sought treatment from me. I used the Simito solid essence method to cure his nocturnal emission and the Steinach reproductive hormone to cure his premature ejaculation and youth gland weakness. After targeting the medication, the symptoms disappeared. This spring and autumn, he repeatedly introduced his friends to me to treat similar youth ailments. Mr. Wang's body is strong and his qi and blood are abundant, as different as two people when compared to when he first came last autumn.</p>

<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Patient Xia Shijiang. Formerly worked at a yarn factory. Is now thirty-six years old. In his youth, he was enticed by bad friends and indulged in the evil habit of self-harm. Although he later quit, his seminal glands had already been damaged, leading to a state of weakness. He suffered from symptoms such as uncontrolled seminal emission and kidney atrophy. What he suffered from most was the inability to sleep soundly through the night, resulting in a haggard and sallow complexion. After marriage, he also suffered from premature ejaculation, making it difficult to have children. The relationship between husband and wife broke down, leading to divorce. Mr. Xia suffered a major shock from this, and his nervous system also showed various signs of weakness. In early autumn this year, he was introduced by Mr. Yu Jiansheng to seek treatment from me. I instructed him to purchase Semen Tholis Pills and Reproductive Essence from Chinese and Western pharmacies and take them according to the instructions. At the end of last month, Mr. Xia came to me to report that his symptoms had completely disappeared. I observed that he was radiant, his complexion was rosy, and his muscles were strong, which he said had never been the case before.</p>

<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Patient Qu Zhiming. From Xiamen. Is now forty-seven years old. Has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. His stomach is exceptionally weak, which he said was caused by excessive eating and consuming raw and cold foods more than twenty years ago. His appetite is extremely poor, and his digestive power is very weak. He has never eaten more than two bowls per meal, and sometimes he loses his appetite halfway through and stops eating. He has tried all kinds of stomach remedies on the market, but they only work temporarily, and there is a risk of becoming dependent on them. Therefore, for the past twenty years, he has regarded himself as incurable and has not sought medical treatment. Recently, because his close friend Mr. Guo Yuankai suffered from stomach problems for many years and was cured by me, he introduced him to me. I observed the weakness of his stomach and immediately instructed him to purchase Stomachic Essence from Huamei Pharmacy and take it according to the instructions. Before finishing three boxes, his appetite increased, his digestive power became stronger, and his weight increased. He said that he had never experienced such miraculous efficacy from any stomach remedies he had taken before.</p>

<p>— Submitted by Yuan Yunhai</p>
<p>I unfortunately became addicted to smoking in order to alleviate the pain of illness. For eleven years, I have always wanted to find a way to quit, but there are many smoking cessation products that cannot take into account the pain of my illness, causing me to quit and then resume smoking more than once. Moreover, quitting makes me mentally weak and unable to work as usual, which is a great drawback. Recently, because the government is determined to ban smoking and eliminate drugs, I inquired in detail from a close friend who had already successfully quit. I learned that Reproductive Essence can eliminate all the pain and suffering of quitters and can also allow quitters to work as usual. Therefore, I purchased it from the Sino-British Pharmacy and took it according to the instructions. As a result, I was exceptionally happy during the quitting period, and the quitting period was shortened. My body recovered quickly after quitting, and the joy of feeling refreshed was a first for me in my life.</p>

<p>— Submitted by Mu Xuande</p>
<p>After my wife came with me to the Northwest, she suffered from poor health due to acclimatization. What she suffered from most was severe leukorrhea. Our place is remote, with no hospitals or pharmacies. We consulted one or two old doctors, and after taking medicine for several months, there was no improvement. In desperation, I sent a letter to your publication this spring, requesting the introduction of medication and asking for self-treatment methods. You recommended the external use of "Leukorrhea Remedy" and the internal use of "Female Reproductive Essence." Therefore, I sent a letter to Anliss Foreign Firm to purchase two bottles of each and used them according to the instructions. Before finishing one bottle, the condition was greatly reduced. After using half a bottle more, the leukorrhea was completely cured. Moreover, the "Female Reproductive Essence" was able to make my wife's menstrual cycle accurate and her body strong and healthy, truly a supreme gospel for gynecology.</p>
<p>(Note) Male Reproductive Essence is available in major pharmacies, but the female version is only available at Anliss Foreign Firm.</p>

<p>Mental Confusion and Aversion to Things</p>
<p>Patient Huo Yimin. Thirty-six years old. From Jinan. Businessman. (Chief complaint) - Weak brain and forgetfulness. Fear of activity and aversion to labor. (Medical history) - The case of '6/3'. Mr. Huo suffered great fear and his nerves were greatly affected. Since then, he has been mentally confused, has many dreams and murmurs at night, and suffers from insomnia. During the day, he feels tired after a little work. After coming to Shanghai at the age of thirty-four, his body became even weaker, his muscles thinned, his spirits were depressed, his appetite was greatly reduced, and his stomach was weak and unable to digest. He repeatedly consulted Chinese and Western doctors for diagnosis and treatment, but they could not cure the root cause. The symptoms of weakness became more serious. It was not until the fall of last year that he was introduced by Mr. Xing Fu to seek treatment from me. (Current symptoms) - Weak stomach. Neurasthenia. Endocrine disorders. (Treatment) - I prescribed Stomachic Essence to strengthen his stomach, and his appetite immediately became strong, and his digestive power was also stronger than before. I also prescribed that he purchase Steiner's (Reproductive Essence) from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take it according to the instructions. His mind immediately recovered, and all symptoms of neurasthenia were completely cured. He was cheerful and fat, and even when encountering great labor, he did not show any signs of fatigue.</p>

(Medical history) - Ten years ago, Mr. Zhang was tempted by bad friends and mistakenly committed masturbation. He did it day and night, causing great damage. Later, although his cousin told him the pros and cons and he painfully quit, he still had uncontrolled seminal emission five to eight times a month. Sometimes he had dreams, sometimes he did not. His mental essence was depleted, his limbs were tired, and his brain often felt dizzy and painful. His memory and thinking ability were greatly reduced. He felt great difficulty every time he took the examination. He purchased and took various tonics, but they were not very effective. Since the spring of last year, he has had sore waist and back, and a sallow complexion, showing signs of premature aging. In mid-February of this year, he was introduced by Mr. Lu Jiguang to seek treatment from me. (Current symptoms) - Kidney deficiency. Blood deficiency. Neurasthenia. Body tremors and cold limbs. (Treatment) - His condition was very similar to that of Mr. Lu Jiguang. I also prescribed Semen Tholis Pills to cure his uncontrolled seminal emission, and used (Reproductive Essence) to treat his various weaknesses. I also nourished his essence, blood, brain, and marrow. By early April, he had completely recovered. His body was strong and healthy, and his mind was sharp.

<p>Treatment Method for Seminal Gland Weakness During Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Qian Yulin. Thirty-nine years old. Sixteen years ago, due to the weakness of his seminal glands, he could not bear the pain. He consulted doctors and took medicine, but it had no effect. Therefore, he did not seek other proper treatments. He smoked opium to temporarily alleviate the pain. After smoking several times, he became addicted to opium. His good youth and golden age were wasted in exhaling smoke, which he deeply regretted. However, there was nothing he could do. At the age of thirty-six, he once quit smoking, but the uncontrolled seminal emission, insomnia, and the recurrence of old pain forced him to resume smoking. This spring, because his close friend Mr. Xie Lixian had many ailments when quitting smoking and was cured by me, he introduced him to me. In addition to using Semen Tholis Pills to cure his uncontrolled seminal emission, I also instructed him to purchase Reproductive Essence from Wuzhou Pharmacy and take it during the smoking cessation period. As expected, the quitting period was shortened and there was no pain. Up to now, not only has he not had any symptoms, but he is also strong, healthy, and energetic, which he has never experienced before in his life.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled Seminal Emission and Premature Ejaculation Saved</p>
<p>Patient Fei Lifan. Twenty-two years old. He committed masturbation as a child. He was forced to marry early at seventeen, which caused his body to not fully develop. He suffered from symptoms such as uncontrolled seminal emission and premature ejaculation, which he found very painful. He repeatedly took various tonic pills, but they were not fully effective. Since the fall of 1919, his seminal glands have become even weaker, showing symptoms such as back pain and kidney deficiency. After much searching, he came to me for treatment in the spring of last year. I observed that he also suffered from kidney atrophy and that his vas deferens was also extremely loose. Therefore, I instructed him to purchase Semen Tholis Pills from Jicheng Pharmacy and take two pills every night before going to bed. He also took two Reproductive Essence pills three times a day. After two months and five days, all the symptoms disappeared and his body recovered. He also had good development, and his seminal glands were restored to youth, which he could not have dreamed of in the past.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Banning Bands <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ji</p>
<p>Not long ago, a VIP in this city attended the opening ceremony of a business establishment. During the ceremony, the hired band performed the national anthem in a slipshod manner, which was quite unsatisfactory. Recently, the municipal government re-promulgated measures to ban bands and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to register bands, strictly banning those that operate without registration and those that violate the promulgated regulations, even after registration. The authorities' emphasis on bands is evident from this.</p>
<p>Music is not only closely related to aesthetics, but also has a great influence on the nation, state, and society. Our country attaches great importance to music and regards it as one of the six arts, on par with etiquette. Since the introduction of Western music, there has been a great change in our country's inherent music. From the perspective of music itself, this change is a kind of progress, but it is undeniable that this change has led to excessive disorder. The bands on the market today are an example of this.</p>
<p>Music is a skill, and those who do not have considerable training cannot rashly engage in it. The organizational members of the bands on the market today are mostly uneducated or unemployed people. They do not regard music as anything at all. They only need to learn a few popular tunes to play them. Their purpose is only to create excitement. They do not understand what rhythm is. Therefore, they do not distinguish between mourning and joy, and treat funerals and celebrations the same. The original function of music to maintain order has become something that disrupts order. Especially in Shanghai, where the Chinese and foreigners are watching, strict bans should be enforced.</p>
<p>However, I also think that it is necessary to ban or regulate similar petty outfits which are as shameful and hateful as the bands. In reality, the composition of the petty outfits today is not so much that of petty outfits, but rather a collection of unemployed vagrants. Their costumes are not neat, and their actions are not disciplined. Squeezing into solemn ceremonies, it can be said to be extremely incongruous, destroying the order of the entire ceremony. As for the economic loss, it is a minor matter.</p>
<p>Today, as we vigorously promote the New Life Movement, all unreasonable and strange phenomena should be strictly banned by the government as soon as possible, especially those related to etiquette. Actions that are neither Chinese nor Western, and that mix feudal consciousness with modern thinking, should be stopped. It is not just the bands that should be banned!</p>
<h3 id="e189">Ship Moored at Sulfur Mountain <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Ming</p>
<p>The dawn had already broken, and the boundless ocean, the tide flowing smoothly in all directions, bringing with it a chilling breath. The sky was full of dry clouds, with a plume of dense smoke on the eastern side and a clump on the western side.</p>
<p>The ship was moving weakly and pantingly on the cold sea in the dense white fog. Last night, a strong wind blew all night, but this morning it was completely calm. The waves also seemed tired, and when they touched the steel skin of the ship, they retreated with a moan, quietly. From the iron railing at the bow of the ship, a black thing that looked like an island gradually emerged on the distant, blurred horizon. ——</p>
<p>This is the famous Sulfur Mountain.</p>
<p>Those who have been to the South Seas think of Sulfur Mountain as a dark hell and find it terrifying. Because long ago, when the Chinese went to the South Seas, the ship had to stop here to inspect the passengers' bodies. This was called "body inspection." If, after the inspection, people were found to have problems, they would be imprisoned forever on this small island surrounded by the sea like prisoners, bathing in sulfur water every day, inhaling the foul-smelling sulfur smoke, and doing hard labor for long hours every day. Countless Chinese people died in this hot Sulfur Mountain…</p>
<p>The ship passed two lighthouses and slowly docked at the pier below Sulfur Mountain. Very long iron-skinned oil pipes were extended into the deep holds from the large oil pools on the mountain, pumping kerosene into the oil storage tanks in the holds like tap water.</p>
<p>The sun had rolled out from below the horizon, and the vast sea was covered with glittering colors. The yellow mud mountain of Sulfur Mountain, the many silvery-white oil pools around the foot of the mountain, and the machine rooms with iron sheet roofs were all stained with the warm light of the morning sun, as if the entire Sulfur Mountain had been painted with a bright red blood color.</p>
<p>The ocean was still flowing silently, and the stone piles on either side of the lighthouse were gradually being submerged by the tide.</p>
<p>A tall figure suddenly jumped into the cabin from the gangway of the dock, followed by a dozen fierce Malay men, all of whom were holding iron hammers, flashlights, and iron chisels… They darted around in the cabin like hungry tigers from the forest, and the cabin immediately became noisy with shouts.</p>
<p>"Open the boxes! Open! Open!" they roared commandingly.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't throw things around!"…</p>
<p>"What is this?"…</p>
<p>"They're all clothes, friends!"…</p>
<p>In the corner near the cargo hold entrance, a curly-haired inspector pulled a bottle from a woman's suitcase. He angrily pulled out the cork and sniffed it next to his nose:</p>
<p>"Hey, shochu!"</p>
<p>"No, it's medicinal wine for coughing up blood," the woman cried in a trembling voice, looking at her husband.</p>
<p>"No, this is shochu, contraband!" The Malay looked at the man with an ugly expression.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah," the man deftly stuffed banknotes into his palm: "Let it go, friend."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>Then, the Malay drew an × on the surface of the box with chalk and walked happily and hurriedly to another corner…</p>
<p>The sun was already high above the bow of the ship, and the machine factory on Sulfur Mountain was billowing white smoke, which drowned out the trees on the top of the mountain. The coolies pushed rows of iron carts, running on the winding and complicated railways, the scorching sun shining on their sweaty backs.</p>
<p>The tide was rising higher, and the stone piles under the lighthouse were completely submerged under the waves, which were constantly washing against the stone pillars of the lighthouse. The sea breeze was also gradually getting stronger, and the flags on the mountain were flapping wildly in the smoke.</p>
<p>The engine at the stern of the ship spun violently, and the ship quickly left the lonely, yellow-mud Sulfur Mountain and continued to drift towards the warm, howling ocean.</p>
<h3 id="e190">In the Forest <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>Old Man Yu sat on the damp ground and, with his companion Ah Yang, labored to pull the wood saw, working back and forth. Fine sawdust, like snowflakes, floated lightly and fell on their bare feet, densely covering them.</p>
<p>In the early morning pomelo forest, it was as quiet and lonely as a deep valley, with only the wood saw rasping against the trunk of the pomelo tree, and the sharp sounds of axes and chisels clanging. Occasionally, one or two small birds would leave the forest, the gentle fluttering of their wings cutting through the morning stillness, but otherwise, there was no sound.</p>
<p>Old Man Yu was about fifty years old, thin, his back a little hunched, his forehead etched with countless deep wrinkles, as if recording the traces of his life's hard work. The hair on the top of his head was bald and had become a smooth, waxy stone. According to him, his hair had already fallen out in his prime because of poor nutrition in his childhood. Therefore, his companions called him Old Man Yu. This name had been called smoothly, and now, apart from himself being able to know his name, none of his companions knew what his real name was.</p>
<p>A gust of wind swept over from the treetops, the branches and leaves rustling, and the bark of the trees creaking, causing Old Man Yu to feel a little cold, goosebumps rising all over his body. So he stopped working, shook his head, and muttered:</p>
<p>"I'm really useless now! —— This little bit of wind, and I can't stand it, alas!…"</p>
<p>Ah Yang, opposite him, took out a dry tobacco pipe from his waist, filled it with a mouthful of tobacco shreds, and puffed on it, two thin streams of green smoke spraying out of his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Old Man, you should still return to 'Tangshan'," he said, he was very sympathetic to Old Man Yu, he felt that an old man should not be wandering in this foreign land, living a "vagrant" life. Whenever Old Man Yu was pensive and sighed with emotion, he would always advise him to return to "Tangshan" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"Look, isn't your body getting worse and worse?… If you spend another year, I'm afraid you won't be able to do any work at all!" Ah Yang saw that Old Man Yu did not reply and said again.</p>
<p>Old Man Yu was still quiet and silent, his head lowered, his eyes sunken deep like two holes, tightly closed. After about half a bag of tobacco, he opened his eyes and cursed bitterly: "It's better to die! —— Dying in a foreign land is cleaner!" The sound was like a broken bronze gong.</p>
<p>Whenever home was mentioned, Old Man Yu's heart felt a little uncomfortable, as if he had been bitten by a poisonous snake! He didn't know if it was the gloomy mood of old age and approaching twilight, or what. The unexplained passion for home had recently been lingering in his heart, very strong. But home, home had been destroyed by the turbulent torrent!</p>
<p>"Old Man Yu, don't daydream, —— look, that pockmarked foreman is coming down from the mountain!" Ah Yang's voice broke off Old Man Yu's thoughts. So he listlessly picked up the wood saw and labored with Ah Yang to saw back and forth on the trunk of the tree, the sawdust like snowflakes falling lightly on their bare feet.</p>
<p>The mountain forest in the early morning was like a tranquil green sea, and milky-white morning mist was still faintly traveling between the mountain forests. The sounds of the 　　　　".*:　　　　　　　　　　  simple sound, there was no other sound.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Year-End <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yego</p>
<p>Several evenings, I intended to rush home from the city to celebrate the New Year, but a burst of heavy wind and rain obstructed my way north on the winding and muddy mountain path. Consequently, I sought temporary shelter in a dilapidated earth god temple on the hillside. Before long, I heard hurried gasps and disordered footsteps from afar approaching the mountain slope. Surprised, I peered out and saw a passing farmer, about fifty years old, wearing a tattered felt hat and drenched, trudging heavily towards the temple.</p>
<p>Silently, I scrutinized him for a while before looking down again. Outside the temple, the sound of rain accompanied by the wind howled shrilly in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The old man took off his soaked and worn hat, muttering wearily, and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. He seemed troubled, yet he felt a restless anxiety and sorrow. He smiled gently at me and asked tentatively:</p>
<p>"Are you, sir, heading to the city?..."</p>
<p>"No! I'm going home." I interrupted, eager to correct him.</p>
<p>The old man scratched his head anxiously, furrowed his brow, and without waiting for me to ask, introduced himself:</p>
<p>"But I'm going to the city! Sir, to brave the wind and rain on such a cold day and travel thirty or forty *li* of mountain road, it's truly exhausting. For young people like you, it might not be much, but for us older folks, it's a struggle..."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he seemed to be waiting for me to inquire further: "Why are you going to the city?" But I didn't ask, so he continued on his own:</p>
<p>"Do you know why I need to go to the city?" I shook my head. "Of course, you're a stranger, sir, so how would you know? Originally, who would willingly go around telling people about such a shameful matter? But I can't help but speak; because it has struck me so deeply, if I don't speak, I feel a stifling sensation in my heart, as if something is stuck there.</p>
<p>Like that, You will! One day last month, my eldest daughter and some companions</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>went up the mountain to gather some firewood to have at home for the New Year. But they were gone all day and didn't return. Just as I was getting anxious, her companion – the daughter of our Sixth Household's Third Sister-in-law – came running down the mountain in a frantic state, her hair disheveled and her clothes torn, to report that my eldest daughter and two companions had been kidnapped by bandits to their lair.</p>
<p>"Imagine how shocked I was! My wife collapsed that very day," and hasn't gotten out of bed since. I went to the village head, who is also the head of the defense corps, with tears in my eyes. He said there was nothing he could do, so I just returned home and continued to weep.</p>
<p>"Then one day, a stranger came to our village, saying he was looking for me. I went out to meet him, and he first offered a lot of pleasantries, then said he had a message from my daughter and took out a letter. I opened it and saw it was a plea for help (written for her by someone else), saying she had been kidnapped by bandits and was being held in a mountain cave, suffering from hunger and cold, in terrible pain, and urging me to find a way to redeem her, even if it meant selling our land and house. I couldn't help but cry bitterly. My wife crawled out of bed in the back room, her voice hoarse with grief, and we embraced and wept together, not caring that the visitor was waiting for a response.</p>
<p>"So, we decided to sell everything we had to redeem our daughter. That very day, I went to town and sought help from a money shop called Yuanli. This money shop often dealt with bandits from all directions. I explained my situation and said I was willing to mortgage my land. They agreed. After some negotiation, we agreed to pay half the money first, and the rest two days after the person was handed over. Who knew that a few days ago, my daughter was released? She wasn't a lively, laughing girl, but a half-dead, crippled person who couldn't even walk. Do you think I can accept this? No, I must go to the city to file a lawsuit. I know who the culprits are: the owner of the money shop and a relative of the defense corps leader..."</p>
<p>The old man finished speaking, sighed heavily, and then sobbed:</p>
<p>"No! I can't bear to see my own daughter suffer!..."</p>
<p>Raindrops beat sharply against the wild trees, echoing with a clear rustling sound.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Uniforms <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>When the summer term began, the notice sent from the school included an extra item compared to previous terms: an eighteen-dollar uniform fee, with a note specifying six dollars for the cotton and twelve dollars for the woolen fabric. Payment had to be made in full before classes could be attended. Lu Caifu—the son of a carpenter, Genfu—while his father had climbed from an apprentice cooking and washing diapers to the position of a foreman, he was unwilling for his only son to continue his trade. He believed that being a worker was always a dead-end: wearing short clothes all year round, having to flatter customers as "master" and "madam". When he thought about how he was a person, and the master was also a person, his simple mind thought the difference between one person and another was the difference between being educated and uneducated. Genfu himself had never studied a day in his life; even now, he still had to beg people to write receipts for him, and when he received a business letter, he had to beg people to read it for him. Inconvenience aside, he thought he could use a few tricks, but his illiteracy diminished the business. However, Genfu was already over forty years old, had become a foreman, and was very busy. He didn't have the ambition to learn "wind and percussion" at eighty years old. Naturally, this hope was easily placed on his son. He first solemnly examined his son, asking whether he wanted to be a carpenter or study to become a master in the future. His son's reply was that he wanted to become a master, which settled Genfu's hopes; he gave his son the school name "Caifu" (wealth) and enrolled him in school. Now, he was already a third-year student at ×× Elementary School.</p>
<p>Caifu was very clever in his studies. At the end of the term, his report card showed that all subjects were graded A or B, and the school even gave prizes of slate and calligraphy brushes. Genfu's hope seemed to be right before his eyes, given his son's efforts to improve himself. Every day when he returned home from work, he would urge his son to review his lessons by the dim lamplight. He didn't understand anything about arithmetic or science, etc.; he only listened contentedly to his son's clear reading of textbooks, sometimes nodding his head and humming along with Caifu's tone. But the father also had a kind of worry in his heart, which was that his son's expenses increased every semester. He knew about tuition fees and book fees, but there were other fees and donations that he often couldn't handle. But his son would give a long explanation to his father: those fees were for the school to build a library, and if we paid those fees, we could go to the library to read every day. Those books were originally meant to be bought for extracurricular reading, but there were so many, and buying them would cost a lot of money. Genfu understood even less about what kind of national salvation the donation was for. This semester, the notice asked her to pay an eighteen-dollar uniform fee. Although his son explained and gestured for a long time, Genfu still couldn't figure out what the school was up to. What he knew was: studying was to become a master in the future, and masters wore long robes and mandarin jackets, with a melon-skin hat on their heads, and now it was a top hat. But now the school was making uniforms, making everyone the same, what was that about? Caifu had plenty of clothes, and for his son's studies, he always added one or two sets of nice clothes every season. If he wore a uniform, wouldn't those clothes be put aside? Genfu couldn't understand why there were so many additional expenses for studying. Seeing that the start of school was approaching, Genfu had the uniform fee on hand, but once his son wore it, he would have no way to make up for this expense. So, was it better to prepare his son to be a master, or to save the uniform fee for being a master? Genfu was really unable to decide.</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Trip to Yokohama <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Li Congxin</p>
<p>Yokohama, as if there is something unique, always hear people say: go to Yokohama for fun. But I have never dared to have this idea. This time, I was sending a close friend back to the country, and I was able to experience the appearance of Yokohama and appreciate the scenic spots of a foreign land.</p>
<p>I simply cannot distinguish between the boundaries of Tokyo City and Yokohama. However, driving directly in a very fast car takes a full hour. No matter how long the car flew, I was still as old as before, and what I saw passing by was: green trees, exquisite wooden houses, sandwiched between roads, sandwiched between secluded sandy roads, a scene of fresh green. Towards the latter half of the road, gradually approaching Yokohama, the place still had the same lively mood and color; and felt even more open and free. There were more hills, even more undulating and elegant. But there was no desolate feeling of late autumn. With water and bridges, the spirit was even more unrestrained.</p>
<p>Some say that Hong Kong is a green city, and Hong Kong Island is lovely in its greenness. Then, Yokohama, this seaside city of an island nation, is even more fresh and green, as if the first leaves of spring are just emerging!</p>
<p>In addition to this pleasant impression along the way, the most striking thing is: the countless advertisements in Yokohama for Chinese cuisine from Nanjing Street's Ping'an Restaurant. The Japanese eat very simply: but the Chinese are the opposite, very particular about eating, and even more outstanding in foreign countries. Yokohama's Chinese cuisine is the most famous, and the Chinese in Tokyo often spend a lot of time and money on car rides to come here for a meal, just for this delicacy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after getting out of the car in front of the customs, I was busy with boarding matters and forgot to appreciate the scene properly. I also thought that sending guests back home, I could always cherish it once. But when the ship set sail and the guests left, the sun had already set.</p>
<p>After getting settled, I faced the guest on the deck of the ship, the time of parting was only half an hour away. And the sky gradually turned gray, the twilight was heavy, and the autumn wind ruffled the seawater; at five o'clock it was almost evening, and I deeply felt the end of autumn. I couldn't help but feel a few bursts of melancholy.</p>
<p>The ship's whistle cried out urgently, increasing the feeling of parting. I climbed onto the iron plate on the roof of the building and waved to the departing people. Looking around sadly, the blue sky, green mountains, city in green trees, clouds, and sea were all in a gray and dreary mist, it was precisely the desolate dusk.</p>
<p>Autumn clouds were dark gray, and the evening glow slightly revealed a faint yellow color: but it disappeared in an instant, changing constantly, with varying degrees of darkness. The greenness of the mountains had been dyed with an old color, faintly, and the trees and wooden houses at the foot of the mountain were also indistinguishable. Yokohama City had disappeared into the misty twilight, like a veil covering it.</p>
<p>Watching the big ship, the boarding gates for the third and fourth classes had been closed, with iron railings as the gate, and many passengers leaned on the iron railings, looking at the people on the shore from afar, silently, I couldn't help but feel a sense of solemnity. Travelers! Is the journey in the waves at sea difficult? I sighed softly.</p>
<p>In the final moment, the whistle urged even more urgently. From inside the ship to the people on the shore, dense strips of colorful paper were pulled up. But the evening wind blew frequently, domineeringly, and the ship turned around, wanting to break the paper strips that seemed to connect the two sides, and they broke one after another, hanging down on the side of the ship and reaching the water surface, the red and green like fallen flowers, appearing particularly pitiful under the dreary and gray complexion of dusk.</p>
<p>Looking at the sea, there was only endless desolation and coldness left. The evening wind blew me and I shivered frequently. So, I vaguely dragged my feet, and could only go home!</p>

Plum loves snow. Snow pities plum. Plum and snow together, pure companions. Snow shadows float outside the study in front of the steps. The fragrance of pepper sends embroidery from beyond the curtain. Snow reflects old plum, chilling to the bone. Plum, after heavy snow, increases in_. Cold river, fishing for snow, the fishing boat is steady. Returning from seeking plum on the back of a donkey, treading on snow. Snow dances across the sky, plum is about to bloom. Plum blooms across the tree, snow follows. Having finished admiring the plum blossoms and seeing the snow, composing white snow and plum again. Enjoying snow beside the plum adds secluded interest. Appreciating plum under the snow, one's ambition is unfulfilled. Plum Wife Crane Son, Lin Hejing. Lying in the snow, Yuan An doesn't occupy the first position. Snow is three parts, plum loses to snow. Plum fragrance, one section, snow loses to plum. Snowflakes turn to water as the wind turns. Plum calyx will wither as the warm air returns.

Donning armor, struts around, boasting of many legs. Taking advantage of the tide, coming and going like a swarm of fierce creatures. The滔滔 Jiang water chases the fish_. Seeking troubles on its own, competing for autumn looks. Suddenly, that, yellow flower beside the fence, sees with cold eyes. Smiling and celebrating meeting again. He says that, this year you were born one month late. You should have more knowledge than before. I envy autumn light, flowers competing to bloom. Clumps beside the fence in the courtyard corner. You may soar at the right time. The thorns on the path of life must be learned to be clear-sighted. But it is, the young master has no guts and no insight. With no resistance, it sees the fisherman. In the morning, it still boasts in the watery village. In a flash, the blue robe is taken off, the body is full of red. What is precious about ruling the world? Everything is in the hands of others. Accompanying chrysanthemums as his drinking food. Making people's mouths happy, endless joy. I am. Coming late, with nothing to do, I often pour and wait until. The young master ascends the stage, it's different. The mood of drinking is suddenly better than usual. Holding _, seeking sentences, the rhyme is relaxed. What I like most is that, after Double Ninth, the meat should be fat. No matter the round tip, they are all abundant. If an old _ encounters this day, it will definitely be. Raising the cup and eating wildly, a happy heart. Moreover, it is, able to eliminate the puppets and add interest. Not the same as ordinary tastes. I think you, reign in the depths of the reeds. Free and unrestrained to the east and west. Today, the saw, the cauldron and the money, you personally taste. Providing people to inscribe and appreciate, distinguish the male and female. The world is flowery and people are 草草. To be a person, one needs to know how to be accommodating. The young master is ignorant and enters the cages.</p>

<p>Every Saturday night, Wang Die, _Jie, Xu Wenbi, Zhu Qi, _Huishu, Zhou _Lu, Yao Ying, Bao Xuexue and other singers _ New York Teng _Yan International four dance halls can find _ them, they will never forget the work that can jump out of the water.</p>
<p>In addition to their straightforward and generous enjoyment in the dance hall, most of the other male and female singers (like Zhou Xuan, Xu Jian, Bai Hong, Ji Ying, Ye Ying, Ye Hong, Yan Hua, Manli, Yingying, Little Zhu, Big Zhu, Daili, Bubble, Wu Fang, Wen Xian, etc.) are gathered at Old Ding's house, drinking and smoking, everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency's souvenirs from Hankou back to Shanghai for us were the cohabitation of Da Jin and ××× in the French Concession "Morality" Lane, where Gu Hong contracted "golden" sores, and Wu Ju pawned the evil spirit's pawn ticket.</p>
<p>It is said that the Rose Troupe has invited Mr. Xu Tiansheng, the third boss of Xinfaxing, to be the general leader, which seems very necessary. If a pottery body does not have such a backing leader, someone will come to fight. I hope he can realize it effectively.</p>
<p>Reading yesterday's afterthoughts, seven or eight representatives from a certain society went to the Orient to find Yang Zengshu, believing that he had the qualifications of a bronze thunderbolt. Fortunately, there were the explanations of Xie and Yao. Otherwise, it would have been another unfortunate all-out brawl;</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>I think the society's behavior is inappropriate. For singing groups to fight each other is really a way to self-destruction. False records should be corrected. Moreover, before it is clear who is "walking without distinguishing directions" and who is the "bronze thunderbolt", it is confused, and people in the singing world should express their opinion on this kind of "group".</p>

<p>— Zhi'er</p>
<p>Someone drafted a eulogy for "The Emerald Horse," saying: "The mechanical sets are all complete, the eroticism and humor are all there, and Gu Lanjun's singing of 'Down to the Jade Tower' is even more pleasant to the ear than the nine-tone zither."</p>
<p>Someone predicted: "If 'The Emerald Horse' loses money, then so-called 'detective films' that are nominally detective films but actually disguised martial arts films will be like carp crossing the river, because they can make money. These days, whatever can make money is popular." Of course, whether "The Emerald Horse" can make money or not is still up in the air. To know how things turn out, wait for the next episode.</p>
<p>Someone who saw the preview of "The Emerald Horse" said: For a great detective to dare to enter a secret room with mechanisms alone, the director himself would have to do it. After entering the secret room, the drug dealers don't know how to shoot, they only know how to fight hand-to-hand. After knocking out the great detective, they don't know how to "finish" him, which is even more deserving of death. Perhaps, this is where the director puts himself in the situation, because life is important.</p>
<p>The Eletone's line-up has recently undergone major changes. Xu Xingzhi, Yuan Muzhi, Zhao Bangyin, Zhou Boxun, and others have all been laid off. Sun Shiyi's "Streets and Alleys" has also been changed to a per-episode contract (it is said that filming has already begun). Situ Huimin, the founding father of Eletone, has been reassigned as the director of the manufacturing department and the director of the secretariat. As for other actors, there have been no changes.</p>
<p>Cang Yin is ill, and it is said that he has typhoid fever. He is currently seeing a Western doctor for treatment.</p>

<p>The Fox singing and dancing musical masterpiece "Red Dancing Star," starring golden-voiced John Boles and red-haired beauty Dixie Lee, with the participation of forty-eight red-haired beauty pageant winners representing all the states of America, is now being shown publicly in Greater Shanghai. The song and dance scenes in this film are extremely brilliant and novel, truly a rare masterpiece on the screen. Its ability to create a sensation among movie fans in Shanghai is to be expected. The two leads of the film are on the left.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Drama and Film Institute, founded by Lu Shi and others at Park Lane, Jiangwan Road, has received more than 150 applications since its recruitment advertisement appeared in the newspaper. In order to select genuine talent, the institute has also set up examination centers in Tianjin, Beiping, Anqing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangdong, and other places, each recruiting three or four students. Yesterday, in Shanghai, twenty people including Cheng Shuqin, Yang Yifei, Yang Chuqin, and Shen Chen were admitted. It is said that classes will begin around the middle of this month, and preparations for everything are underway.</p>
