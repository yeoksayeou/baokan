<h3>英法聯名公函　同時送國聯秘書長</h3>
<p>日內瓦　英法兩國政府所提意阿爭端解决方案全文、及法國賴伐爾總理與英國不管部大臣艾登聯名送達國聯會秘書長愛文諾函件、頃由秘書處予以發表、原函略謂、英法兩國政府、依照國聯會行政院與大會所表示之願望、進行調解工作、業已擬就解决方案、並於本月十二日、令行各該國駐意大使駐阿公使、分別送達駐在國政府、所望意阿爭端從此宣告結束云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英發表白皮書　陳述外相調解經過</h3>
<p>倫敦　今晨英政府發表白皮書、內載關於意阿爭議之文件、外交界與一般人因意阿議和條件所發生之印象、似不致因以有大變動、書中主要文件、爲英外相霍爾致羅馬英大使與阿京英公使載有建議與提交意相墨索里尼及阿王之緊急公文之電報、其措詞幾同、公文內謂英法政府切望在十二月十二日日內瓦十八國委員會中見意阿戰爭藉諸方面依照十二月二日在日內瓦所接意阿代表之請書商獲之妥協而得早日解决、國聯多數會員在近今霍爾與賴伐爾會談之際、曾竭力草定妥協之根據、彼等切欲就意國願望所能使之適合國聯盟約原則之各點、加以注意、而一方面擬尊重阿國之權、彼等威覺今應在五人委員會指導之下草定辦法、彼等决議立卽以某種建議提交該委員會、繼謂賴伐爾與霍爾均切欲確知墨索里尼（致阿之公文爲阿皇）在原則上接受此談判基礎、而勿碍及此後該委員會之討論結果、彼等乃决議嚴守機密、以彼等政府議向五人委員會提出之各項建議通告之、文內又切言如受此公文者允依此條件會同五國委員會進行談判宜早日答覆、末稱、解决之根據擬以通海之出路給予阿國、最先爲通阿蔭白港之伊利特里土地一隅、吾則英法政府願照所陳告五國委員會者使阿國獲通海之便利云云、霍爾又有一電、爲十二月十日發致阿京英公使者、內稱、君應施用極度之勢力勸喩阿皇對此建議作審愼良好之考慮、决不能稍予駁絕、余敢决阿皇可再證明其政治手腕、了解建議中所給予之利益與談判機會、而有以利用之云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼答覆　仍請解釋數點</h3>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼今日正式答覆英法府、要求將意阿和平方案中數點予以解釋、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　豫料意國後此之正式步驟、將請對若干點分別釋明、意國對和平方案不致下切實之「接受　或　拒絕」之斷語、惟對於以阿薩白港割予阿國一節，必作保留、」（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　據消息靈通之政治方面聲稱、意政府或可接受英法方案爲肘論之基礎、但因該方案之「不適當」、將提出保留、衆覺該方案已减少和平之希望、因所給予意國者、較其所希望者低甚也、墨索里尼接受該方案之機會頗弱、如果接受、亦必有重要之保留、意人士對於割讓意國之土地、範圍殊「小」、故甚失望、而對於以伊利特里之阿薩白港割讓與阿一節、大約必將竭力反對、再、對於所議闢之經濟開拓區域、殊以易爲阿人潛入及侵略爲懼、其地之農產與礦產、能吾開採今多爲人所未知、故是吾可適合歐人移殖、猶不可必、惟意人現承認英法之方案非一成不變者、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　名記者蓋達、頃在意大利日報發表論文、對於英法兩國報紙所表示之態度有　論列、其言曰　此際情形　毫無　以亟亟樂觀之處、英法兩國所提建　案　務必有以滿足意國要求、並與意國菲　政策所依據之原則相適應而後可、一般人當俟意國切實表示意見之後、始可謂　行局勢已　變遷云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿國要求無效　國聯不開大會　問題交行政院討論</h3>
<p>日內瓦　阿國政府頃以照會送達國聯會秘書長愛文諾、單於英法兩國所提方案有所論列　並耍求召集大會、內開「除意大利俊略行爲之外、該國與國聯會之間、亦有衝突之處、」又云「阿國在自今情形之下、對於任何行動、凡可認爲違反國聯會　權者、均有加以避免之義務、此外、阿國政府對於英法所提方案、並未詳細討論、僅謂　意國侵略行爲、巳爲國聯會所一致承認、茲有人焉、竟以改頭換面的方式、交換領士的口實　要求阿國割讓國土之半、俾侵略國的以移殖一部分人口，阿國政府在答復此種要求之前、應請立刻召集國聯大會、公開討論、俾各會員國均得表示意見」云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　阿國政府昨曾要求召集國聯大會、討論意阿爭端解决方案、國聯會秘書長愛文諾、頃發出復電云、來電所請、擬俟下星期三日國聯會行政院對於本案表示意見之後、再行加以考慮、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　阿皇要求卽行召開國聯大會、討論英法和平計劃、今日已爲國聯大會主席捷克外交皮宜斯拒絕、皮氏以國聯行政院將於星期三討論此事、故謂無召集大會之必要云　小國反對英法方案蔓延甚速、各小國代表現已决定一致拒絕該方案、十八國委員會今日開會、决定展緩實施對意禁油後、卽告休會、待行政院會議後再開（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院　可望不致拒絕　艾登仍作有力表示</h3>
<p>日內瓦　英代表艾登今日對十八國委員會發言、謂英政府絕不鬆懈其謀復和平與維持國聯權威之努力、英政府必就其能力、對於十八國委員會之工作予以各種援助云、艾登此言已造成有力的印象、蓋以其含有英政府不欲避免或延緩擴充制裁辦法也、同時召集國聯大會考慮英法和平方案之問題、現已擱置、俟下星期三日行政院開會時再議、雖和平方案現　一般之反對、但眾料行政院未必拒絕英法兩國所贊助之計畫、衆信此項計畫、必可得滿塲一致之通過、不過有數國放棄投票權耳、大約行政院將設法以避免直接投票法、總理賴伐爾或將建議指派一委員會研究此方案、果爾　則進行勢將迂緩、而現行禁令之擴充、亦將爲之擱置、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日內瓦空氣緊張各方一片責難聲</h3>
<p>日內瓦　英法兩國所提意阿爭端解决方案公佈之後、此間空氣極爲緊張、國聯會人士以爲、全世界凡擁護國聯會之人、必因而大譁、而阿國反抗之志、亦因而愈益堅决、他日國聯會行政院若將此案提付國聯大會審議、則大會五十四國中、必以大多數吾决此項方案、自屬無疑云、（十三日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院反對派工黨黨團主席阿德里少校、頃在諾丁漢郡倍塞脫勞地方發表演說、討論意阿問題云、「英法兩國所擬之解決方案、實乃英國榮譽之汚點各弱小國家對於英國誠意、不復加以信賴、此在英國民衆視之、鮑爾溫首相及其所領導之政府、實已背叛英國人民國聯會與阿比西尼亞矣」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　國聯會協會倫敦區代表上議員達維斯勛爵、日前在上議院提出動議案、對於意阿爭端解决方案、凡給與侵略國以讓步、而其程度、較之該國經由和平談判所可獲得尤爲廣大者、應嚴予貶斥、上議院現定於十八日（星期三）表决通過、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院反對派工黨議員籃斯柏雷頃向報界發表談話云、「英法兩國所擬意阿爭端解决方案、對於阿國所提條件、卽在戰勝國强戰敗國爲城下之盟、亦嫌苛酷、矧意阿兩國之戰、勝負誰屬、今猶未决乎、如以國聯會各會員國間現在之相互關係而論、余實未見可獲良好之解决辦法、蓋列强均不願從全世界政治經濟之一般狀况、一加考慮、而唯知縱橫捭闔、講斤論價、如是而欲獲得滿意之和平、余實未敢置信、余對制裁辦法、並不贊成、余所贊成者爲停戰、爲竭智盡力以求和平解决耳、」嗣又一再聲明其所抱之觀念、謂暴力終不能獲得和平云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英法和平方案發表後、引起世界各處之批評、紐約時報謂歐美千百萬人今皆以不能照此辦理爲言、據德里傳來消息、印度各報紙一律抨擊此案、謂此方案已成廢紙、阿皇與全世界皆不欲有之、惟據柏林路透電訊、德意志日報則爲此方案辯護、謂英法向意所提議者、承認意國開拓領土與覓取原料之權、此爲實施英國諾言之第一次計劃云、巴黎各報雖不信此次方案有成功希望、但右翼報紙有爲此方案辯護者、巴黎日報與小巴黎人報論調略同、謂此項方案並未侵略國以特殊利益、蓋所擬割讓之土地、並不較前所擬割讓者爲更優也云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　倫敦每日電聞今日評論英法和平方案、謂首相鮑爾溫前曾有言、如渠可自由發揮其胸中意見、則反對黨之抨擊、卽可終止、故目前輿論界宜勿對此方案遽下最後判語、以待首相說明其意見、如英政府果確知意國必認油禁爲軍事制裁、並確知國聯其他會員國不準備根據盟約第十六條共同出兵以保護盟約、但欲使英國獨當其衝、則政府並使國人明白各種事實云、晨郵據稱、英法方案欲割裂阿國以惠意國、公憤勃發、非艾登與賴伐爾在日內瓦所發之言論所可緩和云、每日驛報稱、當地與意、僅爲土地互換之說、實屬虛偽、此種方案、直爲從遭遇有計畫的侵略之犧牲者奪取共土地與經濟之辦法耳、泰晤士報稱、和平方案之原文、未能消减前已發生之焦慮、報紙前所載之方案槪略、現已有全文徵實之、方案槪略初發表時、卽已引起英下院與世界各處之反對聲浪、今讀原文而得之印象、亦猶前此所得之印象耳、蓋方案原文無非欲以阿國半壁江山這所有權與管理權奉送意國而已、除意國外、作品處對此方案、未必歡迎之也、彙聞報稱、方案原文已證明反對聲浪確有理由、此種方案、簡言之、直對墨索里尼完全降服耳、每日郵報則為鮑爾溫辯護，謂首相已召集下院秘密會議、由將全部事實明白告之云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>瑞士休養之英外相　霍爾又傷鼻</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日英外部發出公報、載稱英外相霍爾抵瑞士後、偶遇意外事件、致傷其鼻、須愼重療治、吾則此時當已可返英矣、外相擬於可出外旅行時、卽行返國、但無論如何、必於下院開始辯論英法和平方案以前遄　倫敦云、英國對於和平方案之態度、贊成由國聯條改之、如國聯允予修改、則耶穌聖誕節前東菲或有停戰希望、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>海軍會議僵局　日本謀會外活動　已與英代表一度會談惟各方多存决裂心境</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議今日已成僵局、各國代表現正私自計議完全破裂之可能性、若干方面且以爲耶穌聖誕後一月二日、重行開會、又何裨益、現擬於十二月廿一日起至一月二日止宣布休會、惟亦有若干方面以爲日本可允討論平等問題以外之次要問題、以免日本負破壞會議之責、（十四日國民電)</p>
<p>倫敦　日本代表團十三日與英國代表舉行私的會談、擬與下星期初與美國代表會談、再及法意兩國、第一委員會自下週起、變爲各國全權代表秘密會議、同時由各國代表分別進行私的會談、日代表之方針始終主張共通最大限、而在他方根據各國地理與戰術之不同、擬加以適當調整、而不喜委員會等　卓會議、專以私的會談之形式、分別說伏各國代表、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<h3>英反對日平等　已有直率之說明</h3>
<p>倫敦　昨夜英日海軍代表團之領袖舉行非公開之會議、交換意見、英代表乃以坦率態度說明其反對海軍平等之理由、聞英海軍參謀長查德菲向日代表永野說明之要點如下、　海軍同等將使英國在遠東居於人後、因無論遠東時局如何、英國艦隊必須有一大部份駐於歐洲海上也、　英國所負帝國責任、至爲重大、實有維持較大海軍、以保護平等與安全之必要、永野答詞大致謂日本亦有領土與甚長海岸錢、新式軍艦速度甚高、故英國海軍於必要時不難全部開往遠東云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議英日兩國代表、昨日一度會晤之後、雖已發表公報、但語焉不詳、茲據每日電聞報載稱、海相孟塞爾子爵、當日曾向日本首席代表永野大將發表意見、略謂、「遠東危殆局勢、若果加甚、英國所能派往該處保護本國利益之海軍、不能超過全部艦隊半數以上、準此而論、日本與英國若果保有相等海軍兵力、則日本在太平洋中之實力、自必兩倍於英國、英國所保有之廣大利益、實際上自無法加以維護、此種事實、旣屬顯而易見、則英國海軍部無論在何人主持之下、對於日本要求平等權利之舉均難加以考慮、又况日本現已擁有龐大海軍、其在軍略上所處地位、遠較他國爲優、其不易受他國海軍之襲擊、尤爲他國所不及、故以國家安全而賒、日本要求平等權利一層、殊無充分理由可言、此外日本尚有一種理論、卽該國海軍所接受之比率、若較他國爲低、實於國家體面有碍、此項論據、原爲一般人所諗知、但若以德國爲例、此說亦難使入折服、蓋德國亦屬大國、其自尊心並不亞於何國、但已與英國簽訂海軍協定、允將其海軍實力、加以限制、而以英國海軍百分之三十五爲度、德國此舉、固未聞其認爲屈辱也」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議英日兩國代表昨日一度會晤之後、當發表公報稱、「海相孟塞爾子爵及英國代表團主要顧問數員、頃與日本代表永野大將永井大使及該國顧問兩員相會晤、當將現在海會第一委員會考慮中之各項問題、提出加以討論」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日方修正意見　法國海軍亦可平等</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日得悉、倫敦海軍會議日本首席代表永野業已修正其海軍共同最高限度三要求、謂日本並不反對英美日以外之國家享受此項共同最高限度、英國屬地代表因卽起問、彼等是吾有權享受與英國同等之海軍、此項辯論因此毫無結果而散、若干代表深信永野僅欲使法意兩國享受平等原則、永野曾問不列顚帝國究係單一組織、抑各屬地自視為不相聯續之體、美國首席代表臺羅斯今天日發言、各國一致贊成　安全之平等、　各國之需耍應以不同之地勢及責任爲根據、日本之建議漠視不同地勢之原則云、星期一之會議、規定僅許各國首席代表發言、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今晨海軍會議開會，日代表團發出出人意料之言論、謂日本願意將共同最高限額、不獨適用於英美日三國、且亦適用於法意兩國云、日代表團此言、蓋因法代表咋日發責難之詞、謂不應始終漠視法國也、美代表台維斯聲稱、日本之提議、並不變更美國之見解、美國以爲各國需要不同、此點必須考慮云、日代表答稱、若干國間確有需要不同之處、但在日英美三國之問、則需要適同云、海軍會議現已展至星期一日複開、屆時會議將爲非公開之性質與會者將僅爲各國總代表、日代表永井松三今日對路透訪員、以簡明言論、解釋日本對於海會之態度、謂共同最高限額、應規定甚低、務使任何一國不致有賸餘力量、以攻擊他國、日本至少與他國同一切望减低海軍經費云、聞法代表對於日代表提案之說明、頗為滿意、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英遷就法意見　某報所載內慕</h3>
<p>巴黎　據知法總理賴伐爾與英外相霍爾和平談話內容之某某報紙載稱、英國在巴黎談判之某階段中、曾因將有與意開戰之可能性而作讓步、駐巴黎意大使塞呂蒂曾告賴伐爾、謂實施對意油禁、卽對意宣戰之謂、賴卽以此轉達霍爾、且謂法國不欲參加此禁、法艦隊在兩週之內不能動員云、霍爾鑒於與意國决裂、不能卽獲法艦隊之援助、乃决議於和平方案遷就法國之意見、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>宋哲元　將召政委談話</h3>
<p>討論籌辦政委會事宜</p>
<p>何應欽業已離平南旋</p>
<p>沽源城外尙在相持中</p>
<p>北平通信、冀察政務委員會委員名單發表後、時局問題、表面似已趨於緩和、在頤和園養雲軒休養之宋哲元、十二日午前、接見各記者、發表談片略謂、「有人謂予與日方有某種交涉者、實屬誣蔑之甚、蓋自六月二十日交卸察政、至九月二十日接任平津衛戍司令新職止、其問僅拜會津日軍司令多田駿一决、此外絕未與任何日人會晤、後因時局問題、不獲已間與日方要員晤談、但始終未涉及任何具體問題、」嗣談至冀察新行政機構問題時、宋　、彼不希望、　賣國者、　在社會上有汚點者·之兩種人物、參加政委、被希望在野而有責任心者、來為國服勞、同時主張在職者應避免參加、談至此、有人詢宋　將來華北外交如何、宋答、一切公開討論、决不袖來袖去、最後宋談至冀東偽組織之處置、表示進行要快、手段要和平。</p>
<p>軍政部長何應欽、十二日晨十時、始决定南返、察主席蕭振瀛、平市長秦德純·聞訊、卽赴居仁堂謁何、有所請示、嗣卽出城赴頤和園向宋報吿、宋遂於正午十二時半進城、逕赴居仁堂謁何懇談、至三時許始辭出、何於三時半、赴古物陳列所參觀福開森捐贈之文物、五時返居仁堂、六時赴武衣庫胡同應宋歡宴、七時返居仁堂、八時由西車站登車、行時、指派其高級參謀嚴寬留平、辦理聯絡事宜、何於行前、因閱外報恒載所謂河北協定云云、乃由其親信對新聞界傳述河北交涉眞相、並以前日軍司令梅津之宣言為證、藉闢外謠之無稽、</p>
<p>冀察政委會委員名額、最初擬議為三十六名、國府發表十七名後、此間某當局曾表示、未發表者、將呈請政府准許保留、如有缺額、隨時遞補、會址原定舊迎賓館東西兩樓、旋經勘查結果、不敷應用、乃擬以前軍分會會址為會址、俟將手續辦竣、卽開始布置、政會成立期、大體在本月以內、委員長宋哲元、將於日內先召集委員、舉行談話會、討論籌辦事宜、委員王克敏、由滬來電表示不就、刻哲於十三日亦電致中央、懇請開職、以便休養、王揖唐曾一度電請辭職、經陳儀於十二晚赴津、當面慰留、可望打銷辭意、</p>
<p>十三日午、有人赴武衣庫訪宋、懇談時局、談至冀東僞組織問題、據宋稱、無論如何、在職權所及之範圍內、當設法使殷逆自動取消現有之非法名稱、另據消息靈通者談、此間當局、對冀東僞組織之處置、已决定步驟、俟冀察政會成立、卽可着手辦理、又據通州十三晚電話稱、殷汝耕對北平空氣、甚為注意、但渠近來正在忙於「區」內勦匪事宜、同時正利用其地位特殊、建築公路、所有材料及計設人物、大半來自關外、據曾往通州視察歸來者談、該縣男女師範學校、自停辦後、近已為日軍所駐紮、儼然有入異域之戚、冀東問題、如不從速解决、未來隱憂、殊不可測、</p>
<p>河北省府主席商震·天津市長程克、先後因病呈請辭職、俱經中央令准、而以宋哲元蕭振瀛分別繼任、聞商早有去志、在養病期間、卽飭屬趕辦結束、商對調主豫政新命、仍表示辭意、業已電呈中央、懇切陳詞、堅决求去、其三十二軍司令部、十三日亦由平南移、津新市長蕭振瀛、奉到中央電令後、十二晚亦電京表示謙遜、另據天津電話稱、蕭所派赴津接洽要公之宋抱一、巳於十三午到津、蕭本人曾與天津公安局長劉玉書通電話、有所詢問、一般推測、蕭於短期內、卽將到津履新、宋哲元對冀省府主席新職、十二日謁何應欽時、曾表謙遜、因何勗以為國盡瘁、勉任艱鉅、故宋已决定先派前軍分會委員門致中、於日內赴保定、辦理接收手續、新廳委人選、宋十三日晨已電中央保舉、俟國府任命後、宋再定就職日期、在就冀省府主席職之前、關於冀察綏靖主任職、以其關係冀察治安之維持、故將先行就任、屆時平津衛戍司令部、卽遵中央令撤銷、</p>
<p>華北時局、因人事上已有確定、故一般情緒、頗為興奮、　日傳述於衆口之外交問題、表面上似已和緩、但沽源被僞軍進攻事件、究將如何善後、對方所要求以沽源·　昌·張北·商都·康保·化德·六縣、由蒙政會所編之蒙古保安隊駐防、事關察哈爾之存亡、想當局决不接納、目下僞軍進攻、沽源城外、尙在相持中、外傳已商有解决辦法、殊不可靠、同時日參謀本部中國部長喜多、十三日抵津、傳達日中央軍部命令、未來演變、正在裏面醞釀、故華北大局、尙談不到樂觀也、（十三日）</p>

<h3>義務教育　敎育部普通敎育司司長顧樹森</h3>
<p>上决講的「義務敎育」已經把義務敎育的意義，世界各國的義務敎育概况，和我們為甚麼要急切推行義敎等問題，分別講過。今天再把我國推行義務敎育的經過情形，本年度各省市實施義務敎育狀况，以及本人對於推行義務敎育的意見，繼續說一說。</p>
<p>我國推行義務敎育，可說是從前淸末年已經開始了。那個時候，因為感受到外力的壓迫，不得不力事維新，就設立學校，提倡敎育，對於義務敎育方面，當時會經訂過强迫敎育章程十條，咨行各省，可是僅是紙上談兵，沒有見到　實表現，那章程裏規定兒童入學的年齡是七歲，各地設校數，各省城須設蒙學一百處，學額五千名，各府州縣須設蒙學四十處，學額二千名，各　設蒙學一處，學額四十名，各零星的小村落可合數村設立一處。關於獎勵設學方面，凡有紳董熱心提倡多設學堂者，分別給奬。關於强迫人學方面，幼童到了入學年齡，不合人學者，罪其父兄。細查這個章程，雖然並沒有具體的辦法，但是假使那時各省區眞能照章切實施行，對於義務敎育，也可以樹立相當的基礎。</p>
<p>到了民國元年把初，以前的等小學堂改稱小學校，並定修業年限為四年，就是義務敎育的年限。可是對於義務敎育施行的程序以及詳細辦法，都沒有規定。</p>
<p>到了民國四年，頒佈籌辦義務敎育命令，幷訂定義務敎育施行程序三十一條，關於調查學齡兒童及劃分　區等，方才見諸法令。那個時候，因為國內政治戰事的混亂，除了山西省聞始進行以外，其餘各地，大都未能推行。</p>
<p>民國九年全國敎育聯合會，議决呈請推行義務敎育，後來由敎育部訂定推行義務敎育辦法，規定於民國年開始，至民國十七年辦理完竣。當時因為感覺到實施方面的困難，不易解决，所以敎育部設立義務敎育實施硏究會，幷咨行各省也設立同樣的研究會，以便硏究討論各項問題。</p>
<p>民國十六年國民政府建都南京，根據中國國民黨政綱對內政策第十三項「勵行敎育普及」及地方自治實行法第六項以敎育為兒童權利的規定，深切注意義務敎育的推行·十七年全國敎育會議，主張在中央各省區各縣市均設立義務敎育委員會，襄助敎育行政機關，促進義務敎育，十八年第三次全國代表大會，也有厲行義務敎育的决定，同年國民黨第三屆中央執行委員二决全體大會，决議厲行强迫敎育，責由中央訓練部會同敎育部制定計劃及規程與實施程序，限於民國二十三年底實現·敎育部根據這個議案，制定實行義務敎育初步計劃，這個計劃裹面，對於中央，省，地方分担義務敎育經費的支配，師資的培養，增設校舍等，均有確切的規定。</p>
<p>在民國十九年春天敎育部召集第二次全國代表大會，擬定實施義務敎育方案，這方案的內容，除訂明義務敎育年限仍為四年外，貧寒的兒童，得變通或縮短在學期間，其他關於訓練師資，設置實騐區，增加敎室辦法，經費預算等，都計劃甚詳，那時敎育部又統計全國就學兒童數，僅佔學齡兒童百分之二一八，並覺得各地鄕村小學不發達，特頒行鄉村小學充實學額辦法，及繁盛都市推廣小學敎育辦法，到了二十一年六月，又頒佈短期義務敎育實施辦法及第一期實施義務敎育辦法大網，令各省斟酌地方情形，擬訂詳細計劃，積極試行，先後把計劃送部的共計十八省，但是三年以來，因為設施經費，未能盡量籌劃，以致未得大效。</p>
<p>因此我們知道過去推行義務敎育，從國民政府成立以來，全國專家集會研究，政府方面，頒行法令努力推行，但是實際的效果，仍未能顯著。考其原因，大概有三點：　經費艱窘，不易籌措，　四年期限過長，在短期間難以實行，　基本組織不能健全，以致推行義務敎育缺乏負責的人。因此敎育部復根據五中全會决議，重訂實施義務敎育暫行辦法大綱，於本年五月二十八日呈經行政院頒佈厲行。這决重打實施辦法的重要之點，在經費方面，除中央籌撥大宗補助費外，並責成各地方切實自行籌措。在設校及敎育年限方面，從二十四年起，至二十八年度止五年內，廣設一年制短期小學，在此期內，凡九足歲至十二足歲之兒童至少須受一年期的義務敎育。從二十九年度至三十三年度止五年內；應把一年制短期小學悉改為二年制，凡八足歲至十二足歲的兒童至少須受二年期義務敎育·從三十四年度起，遂漸把二年期的短期小學改為四年期的小學。在第一第二期內同時並限令將原有私塾整理改良，試行巡迴敎學，酌量增設普通小學，限令普通小學酌採二部制，充實原有普通小學的學額。此外還規定劃分小學區辦法，一·小學區平均以一千人為準，每區至少須設短期小學十所，並設學董一人，主持區內的設校，籌欵。調查學童。强迫入學等事，做實施義務敎育的基本單位。並且從中央起到各省市縣都要設立各級義務委員會，以為襄助辦理義務敎育的機關。其他關於實施的一切詳細規章，也經先後頒佈。所以這决的計劃實施，可說很是具體而切實的，力避過去紙上談兵的弊病，以期達到普及義務敎育的目的。</p>
<p>這次實施義務敎育的進行，很是順利，自經敎育部頒布實施辦法以後，各省市都是很能努力籌欵，計劃進行。本年度各省市自籌義敎經費的總數共計一千一百餘萬元，再加中央補助費三百二十萬元，總共約有一千五百萬元，各省市的實施計劃，除了廣西省仍照原定計劃進行不另擬訂外，其他二十九省市，都已報部備案。各省市報吿設立的短期小學，及機關學校附設的短期小學班連同增設普通小學，及原有小學擴充的學級，一併計算起來，的有五萬校又二萬餘級，估計本年度增收學生數當有三百數十萬人。假使以後逐年增加的經費，能够確定穩固的來源，那末預定普及的時期，不難各期實現。</p>
<p>就各省市報到敎育部的計劃及種種實施情、形而論，山東省本年度自籌義敎經費，較最迅速，因為他從前有兩項軍事　欵，共八十五萬元，現在移充本年度義敎經費，當然就比較容易着手了。所以他們的一切計　設施，都交省敎育廳主持辦理，猛進的努力去幹，據預定的計劃，全省共設短期小學三千二百七十校附設短期小學班共四百八十三班。江西省的短期小學是就保立小學附設的，他們的經費除省撥十萬元外，都是按保責令自籌的，據報告共計設立短期小學一千五百五十五校，保立小學附設短期小學共九千八百三十八班又普通小學增設四百七十四級，查江西省遭受共匪盤踞，地方被災甚深，現在匪禍雖已肅淸，原氣未復，努力實施雜敎，不遺餘力，這樣的苦幹硬幹，實在很不容易。廣西省的義務敎育設施，和他省不同，他們是就街坊設校，另有名稱呌做國民基礎學校，據敎育廳報吿，以前已經成立一萬三千餘校，本年度起，繼續設立一萬一千八百餘校。所需經費，完全歸各縣統籌，平均每校需要經常費，每年的二百元。其他各省市都有詳細計劃，因限於時間，未及一一詳細報吿，現在大概都已積極進行，並且大都努力的苦幹，這是提倡義務敎育二十餘年以來從未曾有的好現象，因此，敎育部為着急於要確切明瞭各省市的實施情形起見，巳經派定大批視察人員，分赴各雀市實地去規察，乘此機會，各省市在設施方面，如有困難問題，或中央對於該省市的設施上有指示的意見，都可以作懇切的解决。（未完）</p>

<p>年度總結賬將屆　救濟工商辦法</p>
<p>市商會奉部批通告各會員</p>
<p>銀錢兩業均已準備總結賬</p>
<p>三行控制國外匯兌收成效</p>
<p>新聲社云、民國二十四年度各業總結賬期轉瞬將屆、錢業後日開冬季經理會議、準備一切、市商會通告會員、救濟工商業、財政部已定辦法、三行控制國外匯兌、頗收成效、茲探誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>銀錢兩業　準備結賬</p>
<p>各業二十四年度總結賬將屆、錢業同業公會定十七日下午二時、舉行冬季經理會議討論準備總結賬事宜、並定二十四日、開執行委員會議、决定總結賬日期、銀行業同業公會、定二十八日開會員常會、報告會務、各銀行連日對內辦理結賬事宜、甚為忙碌、錢業市塲洋拆、因收解較繁、昨日上下牛兩市均爲一角一分、</p>
<p>救濟實業　已定辦法</p>
<p>市商會昨通告會員云、逕啟者、案於十一月二十五日、據輪船業同業公會來函、請召集各業商議向政府情願、從速增設特種銀行、確定最低利率、以救濟實業等情、當經第七十次常務會議議决、所請召集各公會之處、暫從緩辦、先將本案轉呈財政　核辦、並通函各業徵詢意見等語、經分別照辦在案、本月十四日、奉錢字第八一零六號財政部批開呈悉、　增設不動產抵押銀行、本部正積極籌辦中、並爲活動土地信用、已再呈請行政院轉商立法司法兩院、修正不動產抵押法規、使地產及廠基廠產、均得便利押欵、至確定最低利率一節、於工商業之發展、頗有重要關係、業由部函令中·中·交三行、就社會經濟狀况、逐漸施行、本部復爲改善現行金融制度、便利助企業發展、現正草擬及修正各項金融法規、同時復商請中央銀行儘速辦理票據重貼現、以利資金流通，又爲調劑產業金融、扶助農礦工商之發展起見、並已决定同業透支辦法四項、函令中中交三行照辦、仰即知照、等因奉此、相應備函通告、卽希查照爲荷、順頌公綏、上海市商會啟、二十四年十二月十四日、</p>
<p>控制匯兌　頗收成效</p>
<p>中·中·交三銀行對外匯無限制買賣後、頗收成效、國外銀價慘落、而我國中央銀行每日公佈電匯賣價折合、仍與標準數目相差甚微、例如昨日公佈倫敦每國幣一元爲一先令二辦士半、紐的每國幣一百元爲二十九美元七五、巴黎每國幣一百元爲四百五十法郎、柏林每國幣一百元爲七十三馬克半、日本每國幣一百元爲一百零三日元、香港每國幣一百元爲九十三港元、</p>
<p>國外銀賤　衡稅降低</p>
<p>自美國停止購買白銀後、倫敦市塲銀價低落、我國工商業雖不受影響、惟外匯平市委員會每日公佈之平衡稅率、不得不因之而降、例如昨晨十時公佈之稅率爲百分之四一·二五、較前低落約百分之十、</p>

<p>大敗猶太</p>
<p>易地再較高下、猶太抱破釜沈舟决心、氣燄萬大、　軍用命、勢如風捲殘葉、時在優游境內搗亂、但曇花一現、又告現寂、但見優游如長江傾水、一瀉千里、直入敵軍內地、鐘勇森得開角球之機、巧生坐收漁利、繼着巧生又得許文奎之助遠射中的、猶太屢失陣地、不覺怒髮冲冠、奮臂直起、聯絡前進、王章寳見勢不佳、趕出檔球、不愼犯規、D　軋林勃罰來落點佳妙、搿漢曼奔上叩門、張榮才手忙脚亂、救已不及、眼看滾八網角、三對一猶太免吃鴨蛋之恥、小錘一聲暗號、將球偷傳巧生、計上心來、運球逼進敵陣，不負衆望而歸、小孟嘗見自已人馬大獲勝利、不覺脚下淸鬆、偷偷摸摸、把阿斗暗送小錘、頂上開花凑成兩雙、此時猶太大局已去、知難挽回在瀾、一仟優游侵略、巧生又中、江善敬看得眼紅、特由中衛綫奔出、闖過三關、攻破敵門、眞是别開生面、許文奎亦建功而返、總計優游以八對一大勝猶太隊、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>東華二比一敗西商</h3>
<p>東華乙對西商作初級杯賽於申園球塲、戰來殊爲劇烈、東華雖　將如震、西商實力却亦可觀、並不能全盤控制、東華幸　最後之努力、以二對一克服西商、</p>
<p>各無所獲　三時正即開始作戰、東華五鋒一齊前進、聲勢浩大、連過三關、邵濟華得張金海之接濟、拉起一脚、彈柱而返、西商乃開始反攻、陳祥龍未能截住、尹政達乃攔住去路、一塲風波、就此告息、西商雖得順風之利、因射門不凖頻失良機、幾度之攻擊、均失之交臂、東華因逆風而待、殊難進展、加以西商之竭力反抗、毫無建樹、你來我往、各無所獲、零對零結束上半時、</p>
<p>東華得勝　　　過後、東華得順風之利、前鋒益見活躍、薛文繡邊陲起義、向前直殺、立傳中綫、張金海接得來球、盤過敵軍、在十碼處、照準一脚、球從斜角而人、淸晰美觀、紀錄就此而開、中綫開球、西商乃奮力前進、陳公與送出未遠、西商又捲土重來、惜爲逆風所阻、每次不利、而東華却個個精神飽滿、黃瑞華遙傳炳浩、炳浩乃轉送濟華、幾度之傳送、球已至陳虞添脚下、虞添眼快脚快、一踢中的、東華乃以二對零佔先、西商處此危局、乃出其全力應付、果然如願以償、此球雖結束時間僅二秒鐘耳、二對一東華獲勝、</p>

<h3>江大足球錦標賽　曁南力挫復旦</h3>
<p>結果爲一與零之比　蔡今才一脚定江山</p>
<p>江南各大學體協會足球錦標賽、昨日下午二時半、暨南對復旦於復旦球塲、雙方實力、相差微幾、戰來始終緊張、上半時暨南得角球機會、由蔡今才踢進一球、一半時雙方防制嚴密、各無所獲、惟因求勝心切、手脚未免粗魯、引起小小糾紛、但不久即告平息、茲將戰况、誌之如下、</p>
<p>暨南首開紀錄　咋日下午二時半開始、裁判陳吉祥、巡邊何春暉沈回春、開戰後、復旦因地制宜、五前鋒即一湧而進、約在十二碼處、龔子文翻身一脚、失之過高、暨南錘育祥不甘不弱、盤過中綫、傳與左翼王南珍、王即帶球前進、爲關洵安所阻、逼成角球、由王主踢、落點甚佳、惜爲復旦張容以頭頂出、此時復旦翁仁安截得來球、三五盤旋、即傳與右翼劉承澍、劉載欣載奔、盤至底綫、一脚傳中、方寳琳來個正着、捺起一脚、應聲入網、惜以越位作廢、此後你來我往、各無建樹、直至最後數分鐘內、由暨南王南珍主踢角球、落在復旦門前二三碼處、蔡今才一馬衝出、只見橫身一掃、球遂入網、上半時終了時、暨南以一比零占勝、</p>
<p>復旦失機甚多　下半時開始、復旦前鋒、略有調動、中鋒龔子文率領三軍、大舉反攻、中堅翁仁安居中策應、余澤汎鍾啟雄左右輸送、聲勢頓壯、但前鋒缺乏射門人才、致失機甚多、嗣後左內鋒程式昌負傷出塲、代以沃錦文、形勢即一蹶不振、此時暨南五前鋒活躍異常、時出復旦門前環攻不已、幸關洵安張容沉着應戰、守門周達云穩重老練、救出險球不少、至終了時、彼此各無所獲、茲錄兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>昨晚西青籃球　南星敗於滬江</h3>
<p>—三十三比三十—</p>
<p>西靑籃球、昨晚甲組、祇南星對滬江一塲、結果滬江以三十三比三十勝南星三分、滬江一路居先、南星急起直追、已嫌太遲、競爭情形、尚稱劇烈、四塲結果如下、</p>
<p>（乙）西靑勝同文　二二比十五（上十六比六）</p>
<p>（乙）國光勝慕爾　二六比二（上十五比十二）</p>
<p>（乙）麥令勝稅專　四叫比二九（上二一比十四）</p>
<p>（甲）滬江勝南星　三三比三十（上二一比十七）</p>
<p>麥令勝稅專　乙組麥令乙勝稅專之戰、最爲緊張、稅專雖敗、戰來極爲精彩之至、麥令乙憑其高大之身材、縱橫一時、稅專想盡方法、以謀應付、始終以五六分落後、最後數分鐘、精疲力盡、一落千丈而敗、深爲可惜、</p>
<p>滬江勝南星　雙方勢均力敵、俱非上乘之表演、上塲滬江曾一氣呵成、連中三、旋南星反以八比六居上、滬江反攻、一躍再度超出、從此佔居上風、上半時滬江以二十一比十七佔先、下半時南星調動陣綫、滬江扶搖直上、以三十三比十九居前、南星受此大挫、努力應付、逐漸追上、終以三十三比三十、相差三分失敗、南星陳文誇表演頗有獨到之處、</p>

<p>上半時　崇德對啟秀、於昨日下午三時在崇德球塲舉行、由陸翔千裁判、因此役關係錦標、故雙方競爭至爲激烈、崇德李韞芝、精悍異常、首開紀錄、啟秀溫媛亦不甘示弱、顯還顏色、第二節開始、崇德中鋒楊少璣、即告中的、林寬堯錦上添花、殺得啟秀小姐、只有招架之功、却無還刀之力、上半時結束、崇德以八比二高據上風、</p>
<p>下半時　下半時開始、啟秀力圖反攻、但嚴蔚雯爲崇德陳月娥、郭信華監視甚嚴、致毫無發展、崇德三鋒你傳我遞反獲分纍、第四節開始、啟秀溫媛與許佩英有美妙之合作、故得扳回四分、此後則又陷於一蹶不振狀態、而崇德李韞芝楊少璣等、活躍滿塲、聲勢浩大、至下半時終了時、崇德父以八比四占勝、結果崇德以十六比六克服啟秀、茲列表如下、</p>

<h3>鐵城盃華東輕取愛國</h3>
<p>張素梅身手不凡得分獨多　東亞江灣之戰昨因故改期</p>
<p>鐵城盃籃球賽、昨原有五塲、臨時幽默江灣兩隊、均以參加江大足球比賽、請求改期、故男子甲組江灣對東亞、及乙組二部天行對幽默、均未舉行、佈賽三塲、爲輔誼全黑華東獲勝、其結果如下、</p>
<p>輔誼勝江東（乙三）　廿七比廿六</p>
<p>華東勝愛國（女乙）　十七比九</p>
<p>全黑勝海鯨（乙一）　卅叫比六</p>
<p>男子形勢一斑　此决鐵城盃籃球賽、男子甲組參加者、原有七隊、漢良退出後、僅有六隊、爲江灣·眞如·持志·東亞·同濟·光華·以實力觀察、錦標最有望者爲江灣柬亞持志、而尤以江灣最具把握、惟以往兩塲、江灣均因故尚未顯身手、如逢東亞持志比賽、當有精彩表演、娛我眼目也、至女子甲組祇兩江東亞暨南三校參加、兩江首戰已克東亞、暨南實力平平、鍾標當各兩江莫屬矣、女子乙組以兩江華東崇德三校實力較强、以形勢觀測、華東或能勝崇德、然遇兩江時必有一番劇烈鬬爭、鹿死誰手、尚難預測</p>
<p>華東擊敗愛國　昨華東與愛國作女子乙組之戰、鄉村觀衆、依然踴躍、小姐們均不慣健身房戰、蓋地板光滑如溜冰塲、動足即仆、故行動每似小鳥步舞、不能大刀闊斧、奮勇行之、其狀頗滑稽、雖脚底沾有石灰、仍不免有行不得也之慨、華東路將、因於上决雲試一塲、昨日資格較爲老到、張素梅身手不凡、矯捷如飛、施藕卿亦能應付裕如、而愛國葉喜華身材最小、而動作敏捷、大有兩江潘夢之風、假以時日、必成良將也、上半時華東以十三比四佔先、結果十七比九、華東獲勝、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（二）（四）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>他跳過來牆頭，跑去得那麼快，因此幾乎要趕不上；可是等到她到了那但地點，他放下燈來，歡歡喜喜給她看泉旁鬆土上小脚的印痕。她便跽下來去一騐那些連續的足印，隨即跳起來急切說道：　　「眞的；這是我羅勃小靴子的痕跡！走這條路罷，他們或許是走道裏去的」。　　這是多麼困疲的檢尋呀！可是這憂心如擣的母親，自有一種不可解說的木能在引導她因爲不久唐恩又呼喊一聲，他在路上又攫到了一件發亮的小物品了。這是那個錫製新手桶的蓋，大概是起初發現迷路時失落了的。蜀夫人忙把它拿起，緊緊抱着它，吻着它，好像這是個活寳；等到唐恩正要歡呼出來，要別人都到這裏的時候，她反止住他，但急急行去，口中並說道，『不，讓我去找他們；我讓種勃去的，所以我要親手把他送回他的父親』。　　稍微過去一點發見了南恩的帽，一再經過了孩子們所在的地方，終於發現了兩個小孩，都深深睡去在樹林裹。唐恩從不能忘記那晚他熾籠的光所照見的那一小幅的圖畫，他想蜀夫人是要呌喊出來了，可是她只細聲說「勿響」！一面輕輕揭起那圍裙，已瞧見了裙下面的小小紅潤的臉兒。他呼吸時染了菓苺顏色的雨唇是半開的，額角上的黃髮已被汗水漬透，而那圖個厚胖的手還是緊持着那滿滿的小手桶。</p>

<h3>證券　諸債皆跌裁兵獨漲</h3>
<p>—多頭轉賣了結—</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市况愈爲不支、大戶多頭已不能維持其原有陣綫、出籠及翻空者絡繹不絕、市塲謠傳大都利於小面、人心慚虛、前途尚有步跌之勢、惟裁兵公債忽有變態之漲風、全日猛騰起　元之鉅、不無爲做手關係、進銳退驟、能無反動、</p>
<p>昨日經過、上午開盤、先則編遣微疲、繼裁兵開拍、二十二·六十五·忽有巨量買進、市價由八十二元半、高峯抬至八十三元二角、劇漲近元、論理後列自應趨漲、詛一般多頭乘機粉粉出籠、七十八及二十二拋賣尤爲勁厲、跌風忽起、後列竟反跌落三五角、决盤裁兵櫃續抬漲二角、十九關善以决均皆步跌、惟廿關起、散戶進胃忽轉暢、後列竟又回上二三角、午市開盤、編遣漲半元弱、裁兵又漲二角、迨後多頭斬結趨勁、　風斷而復續、多數咸跌五分三角許、收市賣戶允湧、抬面多頭了結允多、市價再跌三五角、</p>

<h3>紗花　期紗空方施壓力</h3>
<p>紗市初漲後跌、局勢漸見疲弱、蓋以本月份因交割時期接近、空方準備充量現紗交解、壓力驟覺嚴事、人心見挫、惟金融界之多額、尚未完全出籠、遠月市况仍昂、而有一部份金業帮依然拖進、</p>
<p>賣　起收　回跌　　紗前市開盤、因海外紗花狀況回升、市塲人心略平定、近月升起七八角、拍至遠月、漲力薄弱、二盤開出、忽見下落、幸棉花堅挺、紗市尚可帶緊一步、結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲二·三·四·七角、午後開盤、漲風驟起、各月跳高七、八角、因粉麥在漲之故、詎料徐杲又來猛力拋賣、市塲籌碼頓見鬆濫、三收盤傾向下墮、結果、近月比上午收盤價跌一角至一元、遠跌·三四·五角、惟五月期漲三角、查　出達記一千二白五十包、明德一千八百五十包、錦昌六百包、明華五百五十包、仁豐四百五十包、大昌成四百五十包、泰昌六百九十包、賡豐五百包、義成　百包、益昶八百五十包、恒昌八百包、買進錦昌七百包、大孚五百五十包、大豐五百包、森康九百包、義成四百五十包、永大六百五十包、信誠七白五十包、泰昌七百五十包、永昌一千包、晋康二千一百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現貨行情無甚上落　現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮賀去統計六百十五包行情與上無異、各帮冒額如下、</p>
<h3>棉花多方揚威</h3>
<p>棉市　堅、且漲勢甚力、良以海外印美棉市跌後轉向上昇、同時大戶信誠通記之多頭拉力殊强、以致市象愈挺、與紗價適成反比例、但現棉需要頗滯、</p>
<p>期棉幾乎步步上勝　標棉前市開盤、以美棉跌後轉漲十一至十八磅音、印棉漲三羅比半、大阪三品棉花亦漲數角、市塲人心略見振昨、市價步步上騰、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲　角至四角、午後開盤、忽然橫跳三角半、以粉市飛騰、人心激昂、買氣濃密、拍至二三盤、因紗市不靈、盤盤轉向下落、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲五分至一角半、查賣出賡豐二千一百担、達記二千七百担、源大一千四百担、明德二千担、大昌成二千担、益昶二千担、長和七千一百担、生源一千二百祖、信誠一千一百担、源興昌千二百担、買進合興一千四百担、明德一千三百祖、大孚二千四百担、通記一千二百担、裕大三千八百担、振大一千三百担、賡豐、千担、潤康四千三百担、信誠五千四百担、益康一千六百担、泰昌一千四百擔、永昌　千四百担、一日問最高低　及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現貨到銷均見冷淡　現棉銷費益覺沉寂、廠帮停頓、來源計姚花二〇五〇包、通洲花一七五〇包、</p>
<p>美棉業等候高法院判决</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因利物浦消息良好、麥市有力、同業及外商吸收套賣及多頭轉出之額、各月漲九至十一磅音、惟需要大致呆滯、實際上自新近大批多頭了結之後、似較　穩、惜新買刻不多、同時同業均在等候最高法院之判决、現棉靜寂、脚地尚機、紡織品堅而呆滯、海斯德氏估計本週廠用爲三零八、零零零包、利物浦存底爲二九四、零零零包、收盤堅定、計現貨漲。五磅音、期貨漲十一至十八磅音、英棉現貨漲九點、期貨漲十二三點、印棉因期貨商及操業者買進而堅、歐洲出口商則買賣均有、計平果爾漲一·二五至一·五羅比、奧姆辣漲　五羅比、白羅溪漲二·五羅比、原電錄左、（十三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十四日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百二十一羅比半、較上日收盤漲一羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥大漲　粉麥飛騰</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤、各月突見高漲、各月份差度平均達一角二三分之中、成交計達十八餘萬包、至查漲風之由來、因國外報價、芝加哥漲一元五六角之巨、坎拿大漲一元左右、物利浦漲四便士七五、而市塲人心、更因幾日來廠方吸收籌碼、人心惶惶、復有國外橫跳之消息、是以開價即漲五六分、旋以外行空頭忍痛抵補、市面又暴漲五六分、較前日收　、均漲一角三四分之巨、迨至下午開盤、近期初見平穩、惟遠期因獲利多頭回出、會小一二分、後因多頭復有大量收買、市面又續回振、結局與上午收價相仿、觀乎國外麥市之變遷、與我國市塲、實有巨大之關係、所以投機者亦不能傾重一面云、</p>
<p>麥市開盤後、亦一致暴漲、以洋麥在騰、一般人推測、以爲白銀發生問題、或者輸出者限制出口、致漲風奇特、經營者無從措手、故各檔喊價、初暴漲一角外、繼則續漲至二角左右、迨至下午開盤、以粉市高昂、市塲買氣旺盛、熱奮異常、各月份又續漲一角左右、查目下之漲風、純受陶外麥價所帶動、故此後　沉、仍以國外爲轉移、與國內之供求、一時仿彷談不到也、現麥因標準混亂、各廠停住、至客戶方面、高貨又喊至五　一關云、</p>
<p>海外小麥、以阿根廷政府宜佈最低價　九角、猶如晴天霹靂、世界市塲乃一致暴騰、本日加麥出口聞共達　千萬斛、但係照昨日價格結價、照今日價格出售則國外之反應如何、殊難逆料、芝加哥收盤時或尚欲購一百五十萬斛、聞阿麥漲二角、</p>
<h3>米價步步回小</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到四十餘號（貨共八千餘石）、本街銷塲依然呆滯、包子則天津靑島等帮辦有四千餘包、然市况不振、行情仍難維持、故結果若薄稻小去五分、厚早粳價低落數分角許、社羊尖亦修五分、僅陰變元去路尚定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源頗旺、約五六十號、市上白粳銷胃、店銷依然呆木、囤戶取巧、價又小數分至近角、早粳亦小近尺、薄稻包胃乏交、零化亦滯、市形疲角許、羊埠尖零胃平常、市形羊尖價小一角左右、埠尖價小數分、客尖乏交、白元酒戶稍動、零拆頗活、價加起二角、其餘各貨價形較前市又見疲勞、</p>
<p>（洋米）交易沉寂、　市上浮存已稀、而行囤則擬扳俏、進戶以客秈到旺、無意問訊、客秈昨日到仍頭湧、允以江西米源源不絕、去化不旺、貨主不得不貶價求悅、因次售價立小近角至角外不等其他各秈到銷兩平、互有小數之升降、統市開出江西米一千二百五十包、溢台米　千一百二九包、京秈二百五十包、閩米三百四十包、統由本銜辦去云、</p>
<h3>洋荘芝蔴再漲二角</h3>
<p>黃豆銷塲轉機</p>
<p>昨日洋莊芝蔴再漲二角、開三百噸、仍訂一二兩月份交貨、現貨毛　因之成交各蔴二千餘包、黃豆因內地油坊問訊、本市廠家亦有採取、故市氣轉呈活潑、行情　砌二三分、共訐做開各豆五千餘包、除廣帮福州本街辦去杜豆沙黃等二千包外、其餘均爲榨油廠坊兩帮去路、</p>
<h3>絲茶　十一月份上海生絲出口統計</h3>

<h3>糖市　粗砂白上漲未止</h3>
<p>昨日糖市仍呈緊象、惟値週六成交無多、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌二十二元一角半、轉口六元九角、各廾五分、本廠綿白振記一號二十元八角、二號五角、　號一角、四號十九元九角、五號七角、無變動、東赤高貨呌十七兀、普通十六元六角、東白八號呌升五分、爲二十一元八角半、轉口N嘜六元八角、　嘜七元、EP嘜七元零五分、九號SH嘜呌升一角、爲二十一元七角、轉口六元六角半、</p>
<p>南北貨　黑瓜子存底不豐</p>
<p>黑瓜子今庚因收成甚歉、自出新以來、時在上漲之中、近以國歷年關伊邇、而銷路亦見减色、故此漲勢轉懈、且見回鬆、比之最高價、前後已小去近元、但查現在市上行號、存底統共僅　萬餘包、比之往年大相懸殊、市價乃有上展之望</p>
<h3>疋頭　套頭呢拆貨店不欲躉售</h3>
<p>—過年後可望升漲—</p>
<p>西裝套頭花呢、雖亦見漲、究因花色關係、不比大路貨一漲數角、不是爲奇、拆貨店出有樣板者、因有種種關係、多難扒漲、故對於躉批分料生意、刻亦改變宗旨、律停止跑街兜售、掮客有上門購買者、價目悉照樣板碼子而算、吾　寗不躉售、抱定過年再說、蓋業中人均預測開年呢羢進口大减、血本大貴、貨價定必再可升漲二分鈿也、故拆貨帮預備擯到年底、將樣板統皆收歸、多不歡迎目前交易、</p>

<h3>願你做個慈善家</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>天氣一天冷似一天，住在災區裏的同胞，當然十分苦惱！他們身上只穿着單衣，立在北風怒號，撲面如割，戰戰兢兢，正待我們去救，小朋友啊！靜聽我一句話罷！你要想做個慈善家嗎？哈！哈！我們已經把買糖的錢，捐給去拯災了。你不是又要我們出錢麼？不，不，决不，我不需要你們出一文錢，你不必急，且靜聽我一句話吧！</p>
<p>天氣是冷了，你們的母親，早已把你們所穿的棉襖棉袴，拿出來晒晒，就待你們穿了。但是在穿的時候，你們是吾有不好穿的，太小的衣服嗎？要是有的話，那末，就可以請父親做件新的。把舊的，不好穿的衣服，捐給申報館賑災委員會去。這樣豈不是不要你們一文錢的嗎？若有棉帽、棉鞋等，也是無任歡迎的。</p>
<p>全國的小友們！你們趕快到箱子裏去看一看·穿一穿·有舊的，小的衣服，集在一處，數一數，共有幾件，譬如全國的小朋友。共有二萬萬個，每個兒童捐一套棉襖棉袴，那末，已有二萬萬套的衣服了，對於災區裏的兒童，都可以不致於冷死了。唉！小友們！你們願意做個不費一文錢的慈善家嗎？起來吧！實行這個救災的有效方法。</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞的兒童</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>菲洲的阿比西尼亞，現在正竭其全力的抵抗着意大利。阿比西尼亞，雖是一個菲洲的小國，地瘠民貧，文化又是那麼的低落，但是阿比西尼亞的民衆，却有的是堅强的體魄，不屈的精神。儘着意大利的新式的轟炸機，坦克車的壓迫，但阿比西尼亞人，却儘是前仆後繼的衝上前去。其勇敢，强悍，是任何民族所趕不上的。因此，在這裏，我想把阿比西尼亞的兒童，介紹給小朋友們。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞，是一個熱帶國，所以兒童們是終年不穿衣服的，到了十歲左右，才穿起短袴來。有農村中的兒童，也絕少有穿短袴的，普通都用一狹條布，遮着前後陰就算了。</p>
<p>那裏的兒童，先天本來是很壯健的，所以滿足二歲時，已都會得奔跑了。自從會得奔跑之後，幾乎每天，而且是整天的在屋外玩要。他們不怕太陽，不怕雨，仙們能在一百度以上的太陽光下玩要。他們也能在雨中奔跑追逐。因爲終年是這　日炙雨淋着的，所以身體是再也腱康不過的。</p>
<p>學校，在阿比西尼亞，是很少的。在京城中，只有五個學校，除了二個是法國敎會主辦者外，阿國自設的學校，只有三所。法國敎會主辦的那二個，一個是完全小學，一個是中學二年和小學的　課程除阿文之外，兼授法語，共有學生一百六十餘。阿國自設的，全授阿文，學生共二百二十餘。不分中小學，以四年爲畢業。在阿國，入學讀書的，至少也該是地主的兒子。女孩子是沒有讀書的權利的。平民的兒子，是不讀書的</p>
<p>依照那裏的習俗，習文儘沒有習武那麼的被重視，所以每一個男孩子，到了十歲左右，不拘貴族或平民，都得練習爬山，騎馬，拳鬬，射箭等技　。雖然在山中，給野獸吃掉了，或是和別個孩子，打架而受傷了，父母是絕不憐惜的。越是愛打架，愛冒險的，越得父母的喜愛，女孩子到了十歲左右，也得受這種訓練，越是身强力壯的，越能得人的愛慕。</p>
<p>但是很不幸的，在阿比西尼亞，有很多的兒童，因父母貧窮，無力扶養，或被拐匪所誘，賣給地主們家去充奴隸，給像畜類一般的軀策着，耕田，負重，或任其他的勞役。　然是十歲左右的孩子，也有已淪爲奴隸的。</p>
<h3>下半旗</h3>
<p>— 陳崢</p>
<p>國恥紀念下半旗，</p>
<p>小朋友們心中不歡喜！</p>
<p>先生！爲什麼不把國旗高高升起，</p>
<p>好讓它在和風中揚眉吐氣？</p>
<p>小朋友們！你要牢記，</p>
<p>大好中華的男兒，</p>
<p>爲什麼常被外人欺？</p>
<p>你要國旗在空中揚眉吐氣，</p>
<p>先要大家把心齊。</p>
<p>臥薪嘗膽，全國團結在一起。</p>
<p>認淸目標，努力奮鬬把國恥洗；</p>
<p>那末國旗　永遠在空中揚眉吐氣！</p>
<p>不再下半旗。</p>

<p>香蕉共和國—宏都拉斯</p>
<p>（一）宏都拉期中國旗（二）宏都拉斯的地形（三）宏都拉斯的女人（四）宏都拉斯的物產（五）宏都拉斯的男人</p>
<p>一個香蕉國</p>
<p>香蕉，誰沒有吃過？這可愛的水菓，眞値得　讚它一聲：『價廉物美』但是小朋友，你們也知道，在中亞美利加有一個以出產香蕉著名的國家麼？這就是宏都拉斯。</p>
<p>地形像香蕈</p>
<p>宏都拉斯在什麼地方呢？它東面和北面臨着加勒比安海，南面和尼加拉瓜做隣居，西面和薩爾瓦多做隣居。從地形上看來，東，北，西三面大，而南面獨小，活像是隻香　　（圖二）</p>
<p>五星的國旗</p>
<p>宏都拉斯的國旗：上　和下端是兩條藍色的條子，中問一條白條子，這白條子上面還有五個藍星，樣式是很美麗。（圖一）</p>
<p>暖和的首都</p>
<p>宏都拉斯的首都是特古西哥爾坡，在本國的南　，建設於高出海　九百七十五米的高地方。那裹的天氣很　暖和，適宜於衛生，不過人口却不多，只有四萬，比我們中國的一等都　還不如呢。</p>
<p>靠香蕉度日</p>
<p>上面已經說過：宏都拉斯是以出產香蕉而著名的。香蕉是他們國裏最主要的物產，國民的收入，大部分是靠種植香蕉和販賣香蕉，那末我們如果說：宏都拉斯人是靠香蕉過日子的，也不算過分吧。</p>
<p>其他的物產</p>
<p>除了香蕉之外，宏都拉斯還有大宗咖啡出口，此外如可可，烟草，出產也不少。草帽也是很有名的。（圖四）</p>
<p>混血種人民</p>
<p>宏都拉斯全國面積四萬四千二百七十五方哩，人口七十七萬四千。其中美斯的索人和黑人的混血種占大多數，其餘是印第安人和黑人，西班牙語是他們的國語。我們看了圖三和圖五，就知道這國裏的男人和女人的服裝是怎樣的。</p>

<h3>答案（圖二）</h3>
<h3>防空演習</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>什麼叫「防空演習」，小朋友們或許有不知道的，所以我今天特地來談一談這防空演習，這也是一種必需的常識啊！</p>
<p>因爲科學發達的緣故，所以現在的戰爭工具，共計分爲三種，第一就是陸軍：是由旱路前進的，像騎兵；步兵；都是屬於陸軍的。第二是海軍；就是由水路前進的。第三就是空軍了！因爲他們乘着飛機在天空裏飛來飛去，所以就叫做空軍。在現在，空軍的戰鬥力最强，他們由空中拋擲炸彈，任是地域遼闊，人口衆多的大都市裏，只要幾個巨量的炸彈，就可以炸成平地，在一二八上海事變的時候，我們很吃了日本人的飛機的虧，所以一二八滬戰結束以後，我國對於防止飛機的襲擊，認爲非常重要，於是就舉行防空演習，在這兩年裏，南京：漢口等地，都曾舉行過。</p>
<p>防空演習中，最要緊的，就是演習防空警報，這種警報分做四種：第一是空襲　報；我們接到這種警報，就知道敵人的飛機（假設的）已經要來了！第二　緊急緊報；這種警報是告訴我們敵人的飛機已經到了　這時我們要趕快的施行「燈火管制」，把一切的燈都熄滅，使敵機得不到目標。第三是毒氣警報：這是敵機散發毒氣的警告，我們要把窗戶和門等關緊，同時更帶上防毒的面罩，以防毒氣的侵襲，第四是解除警報：那就是敵機已經去了的表示，我們可以照常工作了！</p>
<p>小朋友們，防空演習，是一種預備，萬一將來發生不幸的事伴，我們就不致張皇失措了，所以防空演習的意義是很重大的。</p>
<h3>哲人與羣兒</h3>
<p>— 吳宙亢</p>
<p>有有一天一個東方的哲人走到一個和他鄰近的國　，在一座村莊裏，看見有幾個小孩子正嚷着肚子餓，那母親就給他們做好了早飯，端放在他們的面前，分配好後纔吩咐他們開始吃。</p>
<p>恰巧這些小孩子把食物放到嘴邊的時候，有許多鹵莽的人突然闖了進來，把他們的杯盤都搶了去。這時候，他們的母親靜悄悄地毫不作聲的而這些小孩子們也一些不動聲色。</p>
<p>那哲人看了覺得非常詫異，就問那母親說：「這是什麼道理呢？」她回答道：「先生，現在你可不必問，請你看下去就是了！」那些孩子剛待她說完這兩句話，都雄赳赳的出發奔向各處去尋覓他們的早飯。但是那早飯已被藏開了，他們用盡了探索的方法，終究被找着了。</p>
<p>那母親回轉來頭對哲人說：「先生，你看淸楚了罷！在我國裏我們一切的子女，當兒童的時候，就是這樣的敎育着培養着。使他們都富有忍耐和不畏縮不怯懦的性質，充滿着勇敢的精神，堅决的志向。一切艱難的事情，都須他們自動的去設法解决，一絲也沒有倚靠他人的惰性。要知道人們之所以會發達到成功的一步，完全建築在他們事業開始的時侯，能刻苦忍耐，抱着不失望的精神和毅力。這就是我們國裏培養我們兒童自治的方法。</p>

<h3>魚卵孵化奇談</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>（一）鯉魚鯽魚金魚，產卵在水　草中，是自然孵化的，（二）　魚產卵於溪川的石上孵化。（三）鮭魚罇魚爲海水魚，產卵時，溯河川而上，用尾鰭爬去小石產卵其中，產卵旣畢，再用鰭蓋好小石於卵上面。（四）大口魚產卵，非常奇異，雌魚所產的卵，雄魚以口接入，含　口內孵化，非等到卵子孵化，雄魚無論怎麼腹飢，决不食物。（五）海魚中的哈太魚，所產的卵，連貫海草上，好像貫珠。（六）小魚亦爲海魚之一，雌魚產出的卵，落在雄魚腹部的袋中孵化，（七）鰻魚產卵，要俯伏在最深的水底，歐洲美洲東岸的鰻，必要游到古巴島北方的深海底產卵。</p>
<h3>讀了「兒童之友」以後</h3>
<p>— 啟秀女學校學生　沈韻芳</p>

<p>「兒童之友」眞是我們兒童之「友」呵！</p>
<h3>義狗傳（一）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>南洛和柏德希在這世界中都是孤零的了。他們是一對好朋友，那友誼的深切，還在弟兄之上。</p>
<p>他們要是以出世的年期算起，那麼恰是同年，然而一個還在幼年，個却已老了。他們差不多常常厮守在一起，兩　裹是一樣孤單和窮苦，因此相依爲命，變做了生死之交。他們最初的結合，全中於一片同情心，兩顆心彷彿打成　個　兒，一天一天的堅固起來，直達到了相親相愛難角難分的地步。</p>
<p>他們的家是一個小村落邊上的一所小小茅屋！這村落離盎凡爾地方約有三英里，坐落在草原和許多稻田的中間，一條大運河的沿岸，有一行行長長的白楊和赤楊在微風中搖動。</p>
<p>村落中約有二家人家，窗　都是淺　色或天藍色的，屋頂都是玫瑰紅或黑色和白色的，墻壁都刷得很白，在陽光中照得像雪一樣。在這村落的中央立着一座風車，恰在一個滿生着靑苔的斜坡上，做！四鄉都可望見的一個目標。這風車先前是漆成紅色的，那時是在五十多年以前，它給拿破崙的兵十們磨麥的時候：只因一年一年的給風霜雨露侵襲着，如今變做紅棕色的了。它老是很奇怪的轉動着，好像老年人害了風濕症，而骨節僵硬似的，然四隣近的人都很重視它，以爲這村中能將　　運到別處去，全是它的力量。但這風車的對面，是一座小小的深灰色的老禮拜堂，屋頂上矗立着一座圓錐形的鐘塔，每天早上，中午和夜晚總發出沈着而空洞的鐘聲來，於是四隣四鄉的鐘也應和着響起來了。</p>
<p>在　小鐘塔中鐘聲所可達到的區域內，南洛和柏德希就住在那　所小小的茅屋裏頭，他們可以瞧見東北方上立着那盎凡爾的大禮拜堂的尖頂，此外便是一大片一大片的草原和稻田，在他們瞧去了，似是一片沒有風浪的碧海一般。中　茅屋是屬於很窮苦的老人達的，他老人家在壯年的時候，曾當過兵，他還記得戰爭</p>
<p>踐踏着各處的田野，眞好似　牛踏過犁溝一樣，而他從軍後所帶回來的，甚麼都沒有，只有一個重傷，使他成了殘廢。</p>
<p>當老達士八十歲的那一年，他的女兒在亞特納地方死了，遺下了一個兩歲的兒子，託他撫養。他老人家實在窮得連自己也難以　活，然而他並不抱怨的擔負下來，並且對於這小外孫是很歡迎很寳貴的。從此以後，小南洛和他老人家便很滿足地住在這窮苦的小茅屋中。</p>
<p>這茅屋是用泥土蓋成的，但是很白很淸潔，有如一個海中的貝殼，四面有一小片園地，長着豆，菜，南瓜和草本的植物。</p>

<h3>淋病免疫療法</h3>
<p>— 袁一民醫師</p>
<p>所以淋病血清，病原菌或淋菌毒素注入於患者體內，使其身體內產生對於淋病之免疫體，以收治療之功，此三者之中，較爲準確而恒用者，胥爲淋病病原菌是項針藥之製造，係將多種類之淋菌及木症之附帶病菌如葡萄狀菌是，嚴密殺死，特種無碍肌肉之消液混和而成，卽俗謂淋苗，以此治淋疾功效優良，卽年不治之慢性淋病，及淋毒性各疾息，如節炎，睪丸炎，卵巢炎，膀胱炎等，用之能收速效，叉本藥亦可爲本症診斷之助，蓋有時假愈之淋病，實在是潛伏，一經本藥之注射，則立現反應，重復尿道流膿，好像初患淋症一樣，當此時，只須繼續行混合淋菌之注射，一方面再施以短波透熱機之電療，發電機發生之透熱力，直透組織之深層，將淋菌完全撲滅，同時可用强力透膜殺菌之「滅殺淋」Me:allropin內服，以减除尿道痛苦及收通力合作之功，至於尿道局部，或行「可拉窪兒」之藥液殺菌法，或行淋病血淸「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-Serol之注入，以補充混合淋菌注射之力量，如此治淋，是爲治療慢性淋病之根本方法，亦爲現時療淋法中之最新運用，上海法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院，醫治淋症及淋毒性各疾患，久負時譽，聘有男女醫師多位，電療器械，療淋藥物，設備完全，莫怪其治療成績，有出人意表之速效。</p>
<h3>關于戒煙</h3>
<p>— （醫師佘　雷）</p>
<p>（一）時令的影響有謂戒煙須擇相當時令，春秋和暖之日爲佳，而以暑冬爲不宜者，然而此乃無根據之談，試問何以暑冬季候，不宜戒煙？有何種不良影響？彼必不能置答，據個人淺薄經騐，時令實無碍於戒煙，僅於正染傳疾息猖獗之時，特於夏秋之交的胃腸疾患爲甚，則不宜施戒，此蓋因就戒者之體質，必遜於常人，且神經衰弱，胃陽抵抗力薄弱，爲有煙癮者所特具的現象，恐易招胃腸疾患之感傳，他如天氣之陰晴寒暖，固絲毫無碍於戒煙之經過也。</p>
<p>（二）疾病的關係雅　片能障蔽人之疾病，故無論其爲因病上癮，或爲玩吸上癮者，於施戒之前，必須詳爲診察，將其疚患的原因除去不可，設有時因事前並無任何他覺症狀，未得迅卽斷定有何疾患之因素，則於施戒經過中，務須繼續探求，以期早去，吾則疾病存在而欲除煙癮，不啻緣木求魚。</p>
<p>（三）年齡與性別　戒煙第一要義，須一而設法使其體力增進，然後一面可漸除其煙癮，年事高者，大都體力較弱於少壯，施戒自較不易，至於男女施戒，本無難易之參差，女子除在行將分娩之時，不宜施戒與夫月經來潮時之藥物注意外，餘無他異，此點只可從心理上加以區分，蓋女子善懷疑，多恐怖，意志不堅，所以從比例上看來，女性恒不及男性。（未完）</p>

<h3>神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 馮善木醫生</p>
<p>神經衰弱症之發生，有因　精神及神經病家族之緊因，有因生活競爭，過度思慮而營養不良而來者，故有人謂本　　都市病，或社會病，但尤以靑年期間之手淫惡習，房事過度，或精神作　太甚之故爲習見，診察所見，亦大都爲遺精，早洩等性神經衰弱爲多。</p>
<p>本症之症狀，其　　者通常爲嫌惡就業，記憶及思考力衰减，頭重頭暈，不眠，精神倦怠等，精神　　，亦與衆縣殊，如易憤怒，易變更思緒，忽而悲哀，忽而沈靜，忽而瘋狂，忽而懷疑等等，此外他覺的身體情狀，如身體逐漸瘦削，面色蒼白，眼臉震顫，食思不振，營養不良，牠如生殖器性神經衰弱症狀之顆著者，則除有遺精，早洩等性神經衰弱之應有現象外，對於色情之興奮，遠超常人，其容易疲勞，亦較常人爲特甚，致罹陰養者有之。</p>
<p>治療本症，先須正思慮，絕慾念，能轉地療養，改換實際之生活環境更佳，食品賣禁絕刺激品，卽輕微之激刺，亦須嚴爲禁忌，電氣療法，可謂本症有效之助，藥物療法當以內分泌及有機性燐爲最有特效，此項藥物之優良製劑，當推仁壽西藥社經售之「安爾神」Arolsen爲最有確效。</p>

<h3>恢復學生運動</h3>
<p>— 籟士</p>
<p>誰都在說近年來中國民氣太消沉了。就在疆土被侵，民族危亡的時候，全國人民，無論土農工商都沒有一點表示。這真不能不說是一種很奇怪的現象！</p>
<p>然而我們相信中國人民都是有愛國熱情的，絕不會一聲不抗響地就失地乃至亡國。本月九日上午北平各校學生就因為感到了華北形勢的嚴重，由於愛國熱情的驅使，曾結隊遊行，向華北當局請願，堅決反對所謂“自治運動”，並叫出了“保障華北安全“維護國家權利”的口號。這不僅是在實際上回答了偽造民意圖謀“自治”的奸徒們的叛逆行為，而且是為有口難言的全國人民出了一口大氣，表現了我國人民的愛國熱情並未消減。十一日的“申報”時評會指出“北平學生代表全國民眾而為實言”，這便是對這次北平學生的愛國運動的正確認識。</p>
<p>此次北平學生的愛國運動發生後，為時不過數日，就引起了三個值得注意的響應。第一是浙江大學的全體學生決議：一，通電響應北平大學生示威運動，二，通電全國各學校一致響應，三，組織宣傳隊，向民眾宣傳反對“華北自治”。第二是杭州學生在朔風凜烈中游行示威，反對“華北自治”。第三是新嘉坡中華總商會通電認為北平學生的愛國運動是“民心未死，國尚可為”的表現，並懇請當局轉　軍警勿加以壓迫。單是這三件事實已可充分表現我海內外同胞與北平學生具有同威，都願努力“維護國家權利”。如果沒有客觀阻礙的話，那我敢相信全國各地學生，一般國民都必然會效法北平學生，繼續“五卅”“五四”的精神，負起自己的國民的責任，以努力“維護國家權利”，挽救民族於危亡。</p>
<p>自然，學生應以讀書為其天職，但當著國家土地被掠奪，全國國民都快要作亡國奴的時候，如果有血氣有知識的青年學生還死死地坐在課室里，不出來喚起民眾，共同救國，那試問讀書又有什麼用呢？蔡孑民先生曾在“五四”運動後說：“讀書不忘救國，救國不忘讀書。”這話在目前尤有重大的意義。況且青年學生對於國家民族的問題比較一般國民當然是先為了解，假使目前全國各地的青年學生都能一齊起來喚醒全國人民起來救國，負起自己的責任，那其結果必可成為全國國民的愛國運動，必可以全國人民的力量來挽救國家。因此，我們說恢復學生運動，便是恢復全國民眾的愛國運動的先聲；而國內各地學生在目前責任之重大於此亦可概見了。</p>
<p>學生運動乃至一般民眾的愛國運動之恢復，當然可以表現出我們的民氣，可以增強我們的外交力量和抗敵精神。譬如，在“五四”“五卅”和北伐時代，由於我國民氣之高漲，強敵便不敢輕視我們，更不敢向我們提出無理要求的掠奪我們土地；在北伐時代中，我國民且自動收回了漢　租界。反之，在“九一八”以前，在“一二八”以後，因為我國民氣消沉，情形就大不相同了。基於這些事實和理由，所以我們贊成新嘉坡中國總商會的意見：對於學生與一般國民的愛國運動，當局應“電飭軍警，毌加強壓”。</p>
<p>國家是人民的國家，政府應是人民的政府。在目前的嚴重形勢下，人民當然應自動起來，援助政府，共同救國；政府雖因外交關係，不便積極來領導人民努力愛國運動，但學生與一般國民的自發的愛國運動，我們總希望政府不要加以限制　好。</p>

<h3>「歐洲樂園」</h3>
<p>— 己辰</p>
<p>日內瓦通訉</p>
<p>要講繁華，要講摩登，那就請你到巴黎　倫敦去。但叵要瀏覽勝景，要怡悅心情，要解愁散悶，那就請你往遊瑞士。在這裏有四時皆雪，冰河瀑布很多的阿爾卑斯山，有平靜的湖水，有風景美麗的河流，有“古雅”和“文明”的都市；而這裏也就是歐洲人所稱為“歐洲樂園”，“世界公園”以及“歐洲的和平境地”的地方。</p>
<p>在“歐洲樂園”中，最著名的地方當然要算是在日內瓦湖出口處的日內瓦了。這裏有馳名世界的鍾表，還有國際聯盟的本部和萬國紅十字會，因此瑞士人常自誇為“世界之首都”，但瑞士本國的首都卻是伯爾尼。這個城市計高出海面五百四十五米，現在約有人口十一萬九千，比較起一般大的都市來當然算不得什麼，但其人口的密度卻在任何地方之上，凡是到這兒來的人都會有人多之　的。</p>
<p>伯爾尼又名熊城，因其以熊為市標。在這裏有著很多的古蹟，如十字街頭的泉水，在泉水上的穿著甲　的熊像，食孩子的人，正義的女神，所有這些現在還存在著。同時，在另一方面，這裏當然也有“文明的”汽車和單車，也有</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>現代化的建築，因之便構成了「歐洲樂園」的首都的混合了「古典」和「糜登」的不調和的風景綫。站在亞爾河岸，你可看出自然的河流彎曲之妙，共形態好像一個W字樣。與淸秀的山川成對比的，這裹還有敎會的高塔，萬國郵政聯合會的紀念塔，公園和巨大的議事室，歷史博物館和其前面萬國電信聯合會的紀念塔；這些是更顯出了伯爾尼風光的不單調。</p>
<p>瑞士風景最美麗的要算魯色內湖，特別是這湖的左岸的魯色內城。所謂魯色內湖又名四州湖，瑞士的羅尼河卽發源於此。魯色內城有登山鐵道，各地來此遊歷的人非常之多，可謂絡繹不絕。這裹也和其他的名勝地方一樣，有許多古蹟和美妙的風景存在。如果站在停車塲的附近眺望，便可以見到羅尼河中的八角塔和河上的古橋。這古橋，像長蛇波河似的斜臥在河上，是一座木橋，是一四〇七年建修的；這裹有一個小小的禮拜堂，激十六世紀的畫家加士巴，麥古林加所畫的著名的「死的跳舞」，還有守護神，殉敎者的像等等的古蹟。</p>
<p>因爲瑞士有美好的自然風景，所以歐美人士來這裏遊覽者特別多，尤其楚在夏季。同時，瑞士人也就盡量設法在各方面給與他們以便利。如修築山間鐵路和隧道，以便利旅客乘車往來；如開股旅館於孤峯絕頂，以供遊人之休息；如闢溫泉浴塲，湖畔公園，以增加他們的興趣；此外如旅舍飯館對一般外來遊客招待之週到，那更是不消說的。</p>
<p>至於端士在國際上的地位，當然並不因爲它是「歐洲樂園」而减低其重要性。如前述的日內瓦是國際聯盟的所在地，歐洲列强的一切重耍問題都要在這裏求解决，因之從列强在這裏以所玩的外交把戲，便可看出歐洲乃至世界形勢之發展和變化；此外如洛桑和洛迦諾，也是近年來列强召集重要會議和簽訂重要公的的所在地。當然，瑞士之所以成爲這樣的國家，一則是由其地勢所使然，但在另一方面，其政治制度，其與列强之關係，也是其主耍原因之一。因爲它所施行的是聯邦共和制，在這裏的人們行動都比較自由，所以過去各國亡命的政治家都到瑞士來避難，而各國的重要交涉也都來這要進行；更主要的，是因爲它是各國所承認的永久局外中立國，所以什麼國聯和各種國際的重要機關都設在牠的國境內，許多重要的國際會議也都在這裏舉行。但是，近年來因爲國際矛盾的發展，就是瑞士也不很自由了，很顯然的是目前有些亡命的政治家也不能在瑞士安身了。</p>
<p>最近，因爲國際形勢的緊張，各國巨頭都不斷地來訪瑞士，在這裹鈎心鬬角地玩把戲，因之使得「歐洲樂園」也充滿了火藥氣，充滿了戰爭的恐怖，所謂快樂的景象早已成爲一種形式了，雖然阿爾卑斯山仍是那樣的露出白頭，魯色內湖仍是那樣的幽美。</p>
<p>哲學講座</p>
<h3>論經騐</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>我們常聽見人們說：「某人很有經騐」或「某人經騐　富」。這樣看來，有經騐便是好的了。的確，我們　認識外物，由此獲得知識，唯一的是要靠經騐。我們從理念外界的客觀事物之發展的必然法則，以此知道如何在實踐中去適應客觀的發展，用以指導自己的行動使之正確而有效。也是要靠經騐的，經騐因此是絕對必要的。</p>
<p>但是經騐的本質如何？又如何才能算是眞正的經騐論？乃至如何去經騐外物等等，若哲學地談論起來，便不如我們通常所想像的那樣簡單了。所以在哲學史上，對於這兩個字就有許多哲學家各自做出不少的意見紛歧的文章，甚至發生許多哲學派別。</p>
<p>一切天賦觀念論者或先天概念論者的哲學家們，他們是老老實實地反對經騐諭的。他們認爲經騐是完全無用的東西，因爲他們以爲由感覺並不能獲得什麼知識，由感覺得不着什麼眞理。他們認爲沒有所謂外界的實在，只有我們的心意和無形的自我精神才是唯一的實在。感覺的表象並不是外界的現實物向我們行動的結果，也不是外界事物之反映所生的，乃是我們心理的幻像，完全是我們心理自己生起的色相或概念。桌子並不是外界實存的桌子，桌子只存在於我們的心裏或者是存在於上帝的心裹，巴克萊就是如此說着。自然，這種完全反對經騐論的哲學是十足的觀念論的哲學。他們從不想到外物之反映於頭腦中的表象如果盡是幻像，外物本身如果根本不存在，那麼這些哲學家自身的肉體不是也是宇宙萬物之一種嗎？縱然在別人看來他們或者也是假的，但在他們自己看來，到底還是不是有自己這樣一個肉身存在呢，如果說自己的肉身也只是一個幻像，沒有實體，那麼他們的心又怎樣能存在呢？據笛卡兒說，「我思故我在，」寬細看他這話的意義，已經是自己證明他的理論不確。因爲旣能思則必有我在，如此不是我在所以才能思嗎？然而我也是一個和別的外物一樣的外物，我旣能由思而經騐我自己這一外物之存在，則我們亦能經騐別的外物之存在，不是也很自然的嗎？因此，這種絕對吾認經騐之可能的哲學是絕對觀念論的哲學，牠是根本不正確的。</p>
<p>但是，說反對經騐諭的哲學是錯誤的和觀念的東西，並不是就說只要是主張經騐論的哲學就完全是正確的非觀念的了。其實在經騐中義中也有觀念的不正確的哲學派刖，因爲在這裹面尚有純經騐論的，二元論的經騐論　和唯物論的經騐論的種種哲學，應當加以區別。</p>
<p>康德是先騐中義的哲學家，他把時空當作先騐的先天形式的東西看待，他也認爲在純粹理性之中存在着先騐的理念和法則，這要完全靠自我的悟性去達到。但是，康德却並不完全吾認經騐，他主張知識是由感覺和經騐的道路而獲得的，甚至經騐是有必然性和因果法則的，認識亦起於客觀事物對於我們本性之作用。不過他以爲單憑感覺的經騐所獲得的知識不是眞知，因此在經騐的範揮內說，外物是不可知的，要達到外物和獲得眞知，必須經過悟性作用，經過存在於純粹理性中之先天的理念的思維形式與法則。這樣，康德是一面認識有物目體，承認經騐之一定的作用和其必然因果性，但他一面則又認爲物自體不可知，不能由經騐去獲得，而在經過外界反映的經騐之外，尚有先天的理念和思維形式與法則。所以康德是一隻脚站在唯物諭的船上，另一隻脚則站在唯心理的神秘主義的船上，成爲二元論的哲學家。正爲了這點，所以左邊的唯物諭者反對他，右邊的唯　諭者如蘇爾慈，費希特等等也反對他。當然，在我們看來，他的罪過不在於承認有物自體和經騐之可能並以它作爲知識之泉源等等，而是在於他的物不可知論和思維及其法則之先騐主義。因爲物自身旣完全是不可知的，那我們又經騐什麼呢？不由經騐反映外界的法則，以構成思維法則和其形式，則先騐的法則從何得來，悟性叉如何能憑空地去創造它呢？這都是他的不澈底的神秘性之所在。</p>
<p>至於馬赫一派的感覺論者，他們外觀上打着經騐論的旗幟，其實是比康德的二元論退後得更遠的唯心論。因爲他們雖口頭說一切知識都由經騐，並且說我們的思維與觀念的形成並不是有一個預存的心，但他們却說形成我們的觀念或槪念的東西旣不是心也不是物，而只是一些感覺要素之綜合。他們和絕對的唯心諭者一樣，不承認有外界的實在性，即連康德的物自身是存在的那種前提也是不承認的。自然，他們即使有時也前進一步，承認外物存在了，但他們仍一樣不能超過休謨的懷疑論，而認爲物自身是不可知的，當然更只能像康德那樣成爲物不可知論者了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，在經騐論的陣營中，對於怎樣認識經騐本身和怎樣運用經騐方法去認識世界，是有着完全不同的哲學體系的。純經騐論者之運用經騐的方法去認識世界，始終是把經騐圈在主觀的唯心的圈子裏，不使它達到物的彼岸，經騐不是經騐外的世界，而經騐就只是主觀的心理要素之分離結合而已。在他們手裹的經騐並不是認識外界的方法，外界也不是經騐的終點，而經騐就是以它自己爲究極和終點。這樣的經騐諭者能經騐出什麼來，我想不待反駁也可以使人明白了。因爲沒有外物便沒有認識和經騐的對象；外物不可知則認識和經騐便無用武之地；完全不接觸外界，則所謂經騐只是主觀的精神在那裏幻想一切，妄造一切，那還算什麼對於外界的經騐呢？</p>
<p>正確的哲畢的確是經騐論本質的哲學，但它所認識的經騐本質，乃是人類精神在經騐外在世界，却不是只經騐經騐自己本身。因爲除外物作用於我們的感覺器官而生起感覺，就不能有經騐，經騐是物我的交互作用，沒有物的作用就不能有空虛的精神的經騐發生。要談經騐就有外物存在，由經騐之可能也證明外物是實際存在了的。並且經騐就是一種認識外物的過程，雖然因爲人類的文化程度和所運用的思維方法不同，而使經騐的效能有大小，但不能說外物是不可知的，因爲外物如不可知就不能談經騐。經騐是一種認識的方法和道路，我們所謂運用經騐是在依於這種道路和方法去達到外界，不是以經騐爲目的，爲終結。因此我們不能把經騐當作神物看待，以爲經騐自身就可以滿足一切，甚至萬有都只藏在經騐本身之中而不存在於經騐以外的世界，這便是正確的新的經騐論哲學。</p>

<h3>不列顚產業界的一斑</h3>
<p>— 沅君</p>
<p>許多人都把英國譬作「紳士型」的國家，從外表看去，確是雍容華貴，無論新興的美利堅合衆國也沒有他的瀟洒大方，然而這位紳士近幾年來却也表示了襄頹敗落的若幹苦况，他是不是仍能保留他的青春叫經？確是當下我們所代爲疑慮的。</p>
<p>英國近幾年來的經濟地位差不多經常的襄落下去，生產量也一月少於一月。一年來的物價低落得　至不可制止。失業的人數是增加着，據官塲統計，失業人數增加了三十萬人。</p>
<p>在他方面，英吉利顯然是在圖最後的掙扎。他的產業界正有很深厚的變遷，這就是一切產業的合理化，獨占組織的形成，世界市塲上英國工業競爭力之再造。這個進程，在英國遭遇很大的難關，以一塲堅强的鬥爭才克服下來。某項產業部門，允其是新工業，已經在世界市塲上佔據了成功的地位了。電料工業品的出口，英國在現在佔全世界的第一位。許多人說英國工業資本家是絕望於恢復英國的工業了，其實這是錯誤的，觀乎投資於工業的總數之增加，就可知道了。</p>
<p>在個別的部門上，低落的現象最甚的莫如媒炭業。可是從資本家的立塲上講，却已較前幾年有了顯著的進步。銅鐵生產在停滯中，國內消費也不發揚。</p>
<p>據報告，關於新工業如化學，電氣，汽車，影片等的營業趨勢是很好的。</p>
<p>這里我們應該叙述到英國產業界的轉化運動之槪况：所謂轉化運動之方向不出於兩途：一是獨占組織，一爲工資减削。英國獨占組織之困離，很明顯的，是以借貸資本來扶助工業企業之特殊方法，因爲這資本的利息首先就成爲公司的負担。他們現在還希望高利潤之繼續，但他們現在是在合併中經受嚴重的犧牲了。</p>
<p>恰巧在許多企業之過渡的資本主義化的見地上，獨占組織是遭遇着很大的困難，雖然這種困難還是容易克服的。大的托辣斯的組成，當以南威爾士煤礦之合併一事爲最値得紀錄。</p>
<p>這里有一件有趣的事，就是在集中媒礦管理方面，引起了反私人「皇產」鬥爭。工黨就主張「皇產」收歸國有，資本家頗贊成此議，蓋所以便其絕對獨占之私圖也。</p>
<p>在棉織業界也具同一現象。</p>
<p>從資本主義的立塲上，英國經濟地位之一般的促進，其最大的希望是勞動階級爲「產業和平」而合作的趨勢。這個計劃的基礎是在孟特頭勒大會（Mond-Turner　Conference）上所建立的。該會主要自的在「階級協調」。</p>
<p>產業中這種新精神的結果，就有這樣的事實，在最初七個月中一百十萬勞動者的工資是减少了。此後鐵路工人的工資平均减低百分之二半，於是鐵路公司每年從工人身上可儉省至三百萬磅。</p>
<p>英國工會的勢力，因爲失業人數的增加，是大大的不爲勞動羣衆所滿意了。曠工在職人數由九五八·〇〇〇人减至六二六·〇〇〇人，這個失業形勢與資本家之强制减少工資，使得工會領袖恐懼有任何鬥爭危機的到來。</p>
<p>至於英國政府對於救濟貿易的辦法，則不外是减少地方稅，减少媒鐵出口鐵路運輸費，這樣自然並木會立刻挽回了舊工業的危機，所以政府有採用保護政策的必要。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫之言曰：「我們已担負起這個保證，而且要與之始終，就是對於食物絕不採取保護或相同的政策。自然，保障依然是本黨的政策，根據經騐，或者在形式上有相當的簡單化。」這就無異爲此政策之宣言了。</p>
<h3>名人軼名</h3>
<p>— 仰安</p>
<p>（一）名人的健忘</p>
<p>班樂衛是一位出名的數學家，會三任法國內閣總理；照一般的情形說，這種人的腦筋總該是很淸醒的，可是他却恰恰相反的糊塗，甚至連自己的洗車停在門口也會忘記，另自叫街車出門。後來到街上買了一點東西回來，那汽車夫間他住宅的門牌號數，他誤把電話的號碼說了出來，害得車夫苦找了半天，而他却坐在車子裏睡着了。</p>
<p>有一决他的好一個朋友談話，可是等時間快到了，他却又要出去一下，於是便在門上釘了一張紙條，這樣的寫着：「班樂衛十分鐘內卽回，請等一會。」後來他從外而回來，一看門上說明了班樂衛不在家，便坐在台階上苦苦的等着，等他的朋友出來時問他爲什麼坐在門口，他才恍　記起自己就是班樂衛。</p>
<p>英國的化學家兼電學家法拉脫，他的記憶力也壞得很可驚人。有一决，英皇召見他，可是他竟忘記了；後來苦想了半天，却又錯跑到一個公爵那裏去了。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>有一回，他朋友差人找他去談話，他答應馬上就去。等來人去後，他立刻披上外衣出來，可是還沒走上十多步路，便忘了朋友的約會，還自言自語地說：「這麼晚還出去散步作什麼？」於是又走了回來。</p>
<p>他在試騐室裏更是笑話百出。他常是手裏拿着了這樣東西，還要到各處亂找；苦找了半天再沒發現時，他便要大發脾氣把手裏東西一丟，跑上街去買；結果總是走到半途忘了所要買的東西的名稱，又走回來，才看到他所要的那樣東西了。</p>
<p>科學家牛頓，更是一位糊塗得出名的名人，有一次，他朋友到他家裏去訪他，他便自己跑去取酒　客，誰知他這一去就是兩個鐘頭，把酒也忘了，客人也忘了；他朋友坐在客廳裏等得耐不住了，才跑到各處去找他，却發現他竟若無其事地在實騐室裹實騐起來了。</p>
<p>又一次，他的知己朋友司托克列來找他，這時牛頓正在實騐室裏工作，司托克列便走到他臥室裏坐下。見那邊桌上正放着一盤蒸鷄，是他的午餐，司托克列便毫不客氣的替他吃了。牛頓跑過來一看，不見了桌上的蒸鷄，還很驚異地望着司托克列說：「我這人記性眞不行，我還以爲沒吃飯，却原來早就吃了。」</p>
<p>更有一回，在冬天夜裏，牛頓在火爐旁邊看書，爐子裏的火燒得很紅，他覺得太熱了，便加上許多灰，以减少火力，可是仍舊熱不可當。於是他把僕人喊來，吩咐他說：「這爐旁太熱了，你帮我把牠移遠些。」</p>
<p>僕人聽了他的話，很奇怪地回答說：「主人，，移爐子是沒有方法的，頂好是你把椅子移遠些，不是可以不熱了嗎？」</p>
<p>牛頓想了一想，恍然道：「對呀，我怎麼就沒想到呢？」</p>
<p>第二回他又在爐旁看書，爐上放着一隻鍋，正在燒水，僕人預備給他作晚餐，可是他却吩咐僕人說：「你祇要拿幾只鷄蛋來，我要吃時自己會煮，你去好了！」</p>
<p>僕人把鷄蛋送來放在桌子上，便自己去了；牛頓看書看到一段落時，覺得有點餓了，便順手把鷄蛋放入鍋裏，仍舊去看書。</p>
<p>等到看書看完了，他才想到要吃鷄蛋；可是抬頭一看，鷄蛋仍在桌上沒有動，再向鍋裏一看，原來煮的却是一隻從他身上取下來的掛錶。</p>
<p>（二）偉人的壯語</p>
<p>紀元前四世紀，希臘君主亞力山大東征西伐，闢地萬里，世界上所有的土地差不多都歸入他的掌握中，可是他心還不足，當他征服埃及之後，便問左右隨從：「埃及以西是什麼地方？」</p>
<p>「撒哈拉大沙漠，一直到大地的極端沒有植物生長。」</p>
<p>於是他便領兵折回亞細亞，刦掠中亞各地，然後又橫渡裏海，攀登俯視世界的雪山，指着北方一片荒凉的地帶問道：「那地方之外又是何處？」</p>
<p>「那邊盡是些冰凍的河流，綿延不斷，直至地辦的邊緣；除冰雪而外，別無他物。」</p>
<p>他又率兵向南進展，抵印度，各城都給他一一攻下，最後到達恒河，又問左右：「此地以東還有何地？」</p>
<p>「從此地到世界極端都是叢生的樹木，漫山遍野的怪獸，並無路可走。」</p>
<p>他聽了這許多掃興的話，心裏氣得沒有辦法，遂令建造大批的船隻，順流西向走入大海，又問道：「水的對方還有什麼？」</p>
<p>「盡是一片汪洋，銜接到大地的邊際，沒有人跡的。」</p>
<p>回答的人還沒有把話說完，亞力山大便縱聲大笑起來，說：「凡有人跡可到的世界，不管東，西，南，北，都已屬我所有，再無可征了，然而倒沒有想到世界竟是這樣的渺小，竟經不起我幾次的征伐啊！」</p>
<p>二千年前，還有個不可一世的怪物，那便是羅馬大帝凱撒。他在羅馬當政時代，也和亞力山大似的東征西伐，闢地萬里；在世界歷史中，也算得是一個不可多見的偉入了。</p>
<p>有一次，他乘船渡海峽，途中遇暴風雨，一時海中巨浪洶湧，似乎在頃刻間船有沉沒的可能。船主嚇得面無人色，祇得跪下來望着天說：「萬事休了，萬事休了！」</p>
<p>他看到船主那副神氣，心裏眞有說不出的好笑，可是他還是一本正經地把船主拉起來，關照他說：「怕什麼，有我凱撒在這裏，船是不能沉的呀！」</p>

<h3>提賬簿（七）</h3>
<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>老頭子翻起一雙眼睛，痴呆的望着我，似乎失掉了魂魄，又像一個快要落氣的病人；這副可憐的樣兒，忽然使我記起父親那年給禁烟委員敲詐的情形，不由的全身起了一次冷噤，情緒慈軟了幾分。但是轉而一想：心軟的人兒不適於在現社會中生存。的確，目前當大官的，發大財的，誰不是一副硬心腸？我的希望是：同大官坐在一條凳兒上，同有錢人握手行禮。那麼自己就不得不撈錢，撈錢就得把同情心丟到址圾堆里去。這麼一打算，便混身澎漲着惡毒的血液；轉眼瞧那老頭子，覺得可惱可恨：他那吝嗇的樣兒，恰成了我的昇官圖上底障碍，如果我要達到自己的慾望，首先就要向老頭子開刀，剝他的皮，抽他的筋，還要拿他的骨頭熬成油。於是挺起胸膛，操着嚴厲的口吻：（未完）</p>

<h3>滑稽博士趣事李阿毛情塲敗北記</h3>
<p>李阿毛博士（徐卓呆）因爲和她的愛女徐綦小姐在婚姻問題上意見相左，父女倆發生了一點小小衝突。這事情知道的人很多了，可是大家一定不知道李阿毛先生在不久以前，曾經在情塲上做過一次敗兵之將，當過一回愛喜戀劇中的丑角哩。</p>
<p>李博士的戀愛對手很多，倉隱秋，英茵，雷夢娜等都是，而他集中力量進攻的假想敵却是殷明珠。</p>
<p>在有一個時候，（那時李博士在一個戲院子裹當經理，殷明珠她們便是那戲院裹的舞星。）他常常帶着殷明珠上街買東西，衣飾等物，每天都有報效。一天，他自己一手做成了機會，的殷明珠晚上去游玩，她居然答應了。於是這位肥頭胖耳，眼睛一眨一眨，比哈代還耐人尋味的胖子，樂得無以復加，速他自己的太太的約會也拒絕了。不料到了晚上，殷明珠忽然失約，和戲院老闆喜尋歡作樂去了。直氣得李博士一雙尊眼，受了催眠似的貶個不停。</p>
<p>類似這樣的笑話，不知鬧了多少。有一次他正在老闆面前大講殷明珠的壞話，（他不知道她的失約原是爲了老闆，）不斜殷明珠却笑嘻嘻的站在他後面，弄得他一時大窘，眼睛又尷尬得大貶而特貶起來。而一轉眼之間，殷明珠竟和老闆兩個，並肩把臂，得意揚揚地出去了。……總之，他完全做了一個戀愛喜劇中的丑角。</p>
<p>以上云云，雖然事出無因，却是查有實據，不過那幽默故事的演出，是在銀幕上面——上海公司出品，但杜宇導演的歌舞片「桃花夢」中而已。</p>
<h3>明星有聲攝影塲舉行奠基典禮</h3>
<p>明星影片公司自從搬到楓林橋新址之後，一方面積極準備產量的增加，以期在量與質各方面同時幷進爲中國電影打開一條血路。要量與質的同時幷進，非有完備的工具不可，在這樣的前提下，明星公司在縝密的設計下，大規模的起建有聲攝影塲的計劃便完成了。並且，在今晨（十二月十五日）十時，舉行了盛大的奠基典禮，預期在明年春之神降臨了人間的時候，這美奐美輪設備完美的有聲攝影塲，便能宣告落成，屆時明星的出品，和預定的計劃相吻合，那自然是意料中的事。</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>有人說：「中國電影界有許多導演，都是懷才不遇的外交人材。一其實，這些寶貝如果眞的呌他們幹起　交來，恐怕還是殷汝耕之流</p>
<p>開麥拉載：「看天倫」後，對羅明佑的導演手法，較之處女作「國風」有飛速的進步，甚爲欣慰。第三部片諒來必更有可觀，惟不知將與誰聯合導演？」</p>
<p>據另一看過「天倫」的朋友說，「天倫」之與國風」，不僅有飛速的進步，即連作風也頗不同也，觀此，羅總理明佑的作風似與費穆相似，第三部片子自然以與費穆聯合導演爲佳。不然，恐「作風」又將一變矣。</p>
<p>周劍雲日前晋京，據說爲的是水災遊藝會的事兒。</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Returned to Nanjing Yesterday; President Chiang Reported on His Trip North; Song Zheyuan and Others Consistently Supported the Central Government; Student Petition in Beiping Did Not Result in Conflict</h3>
<p>Nanjing – He Yingqin arrived at Pukou at 3:00 PM on the 14th via special train, accompanied by Secretary Xie Zhongyuan and over ten staff members. He was dressed in military attire, wearing a greatcoat. After disembarking, he boarded the Chengping ferry to cross the river, arriving at Xiaguan at 3:30 PM, where he transferred to a car to return to his private residence. Subsequently, he visited President Chiang to provide a detailed report on the handling of the North China situation. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing – He Yingqin, accompanied by Secretary Xie Zhongyuan and guards, arrived at Pukou at 3:00 PM on the 14th via train. The station was under tight security by military police. Those welcoming him across the river included Cao Haosen, Gu Zhenglun, Zhang [blank], Wang Boling, Wang Gu Pan, and over a hundred senior officials from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Upon the train's arrival, they stood at attention in formation to salute. He disembarked, shook hands with the welcomers, then crossed the river into the city, returning to his private residence to rest. He then proceeded to the military academy to visit President Chiang, reporting on his trip. When a reporter from the Central News Agency visited He at his residence to inquire about the situation in the north, He responded that after arriving in Beiping, he met with Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and others to discuss the Hebei-Chahar situation, and the discussions were extremely positive. Commander Song and others have been working hard to support the critical situation in the north, and their spirit is commendable. They consistently and faithfully support the central government. Now, for the sake of facilitating the overall management of Hebei-Chahar affairs, the central government has explicitly ordered the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Political Affairs Committee, with Song as the chairman. From now on, the political affairs of the two provinces will be planned and handled under Song's responsibility, which will surely lead to continuous improvement and excellent achievements. The reporter then asked about the student petition in Beiping. He replied that on the 9th, university students organized processions and petitions, and the order was excellent at the time. However, local military police, fearing that reactionary elements might take the opportunity to act and affect public order, persuaded and peacefully stopped them separately. Students from various schools also returned to their respective schools. The rumor that a student was killed in a conflict between students and military police is completely untrue. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – All case files and documents from the Military and Political Affairs Department of Zhongnanhai were ordered to be transported to Nanjing, according to a telegram from He. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xuzhou – He Yingqin's special train passed through Xuzhou southward at 6:20 AM on the 14th. Only military officers were present to welcome him at the station, and no visitors were seen. Chen Yi arrived in Tianjin from Beiping yesterday, and after attending Sun Chuanfang's funeral, also took the Beiping-Shanghai train through Xuzhou this afternoon to return to Nanjing.

<h3>East Hebei Puppet Organization Decides to Take Over Customs and Salt Taxes; Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Tax Bureaus Discuss Countermeasures; Treasury Established in Tangshan, Preparations Completed; Export of Cash Prohibited in East Hebei Area</h3>
<p>Beiping – Tongxian Telephone: The Tongxian puppet East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Council has ordered the governments of 22 counties in East Hebei to prepare to take over customs and salt taxes, and has ordered the Tangshan Tax Administration to immediately proceed with planning the takeover. The Anti-Communist Council has now appointed Wang Xiacai as the takeover commissioner, who has convened meetings to discuss takeover methods and procedures. The takeover date has not yet been determined. The personnel dispatched by the Anti-Communist Council to take over tax offices in various places have been reporting by telegram to Tongxian, saying that all places have refused the takeover. After the counties in the original war zone implemented autonomy, all customs duties have not been remitted since December 1, but no one has withdrawn them either. Local tax offices have not received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, so they cannot hand them over either. A certain British tax official from the Qinhuangdao Customs Office has gone from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin to report on the situation in Qinhuangdao and request instructions on everything. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The puppet East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee has promulgated five articles on methods for prohibiting the export of cash and five articles on general rules for tax management. The articles stipulate that no cash within the East Hebei area may be exported, and the use of banknotes printed with the Shanghai mark by the Central Bank and other banks is prohibited. Customs and salt taxes will be temporarily retained by the collecting agencies and may not be used. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Tangshan Telephone: The Tangshan Tax Administration of the puppet East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Council has established a treasury in Tangshan under the order of the Anti-Communist Council. The preparations have been completed, and it is planned to be established on January 1 of next year. The plan will be to hire members of the Tangshan banking community as commissioners. After the establishment, the treasury will manage the tax revenues and finances of all counties in eastern Tianjin. The annual tax revenue for the entire area is 15 million yuan. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping – The Japanese military spokesperson returned today after participating in the Tianjin military conference. According to him, although many Japanese officials believe that the Japanese army in North China should be increased, the senior Japanese officials who attended the Tianjin conference have not yet made any decision on this point. In his personal opinion, if it is necessary to protect non-garrison areas, the existing Japanese military strength in North China is indeed insufficient. In recent years, since the establishment of "Manchukuo" and the establishment of non-garrison areas, the situation in North China has greatly changed, so the responsibilities borne by the Japanese side have exceeded those stipulated in the Boxer Protocol. According to sources in charge, the Japanese army in Shanhaiguan has been greatly reduced since December 11. Ten of the twenty aircraft have flown away from Shanhaiguan, and two of the three armed trains have left for Shenyang. The Japanese soldiers who previously occupied the Shanhaiguan station have all withdrawn. The troops that have been gradually transferred to Shanhaiguan in the past four weeks have now all left.

<h3>The Renewal of the Central Administration and Our Hopes</h3>
<p>Since the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang last month inspired the national spirit with its atmosphere of unity for survival, the nation has been looking forward to the renewal of the central administration. In today's critical state of national fortune, while the establishment of a grand plan for survival rests with the party's central authorities, its effective implementation to achieve practical results in saving the nation must rely on a central administration with sufficient capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can see today in this renewal of the central administration is Chiang's replacement as head of the Executive Yuan and the replacement of the ministers of interior affairs, foreign affairs, railways, and industry, as well as the appointment of scholars as secretary-general and director of political affairs. At least, what has been reflected in public opinion recently has not shown any dissatisfaction. The new central administrative personnel seem to be fairly satisfactory. However, what we are concerned with is not merely the composition of these new central administrative members. The most important thing is whether, after this renewal, the administrative capacity can be strengthened so that the Executive Yuan can effectively shoulder its responsibilities. In the past, the biggest flaw of the central administration was its "inability to act." The reason for this inability was insufficient capacity to fulfill its responsibilities. Past events are still vivid in our memory, and the damage to national affairs caused by this is immeasurable. Now, the replacement of Chiang as the head of the administration is seen as a sign of strengthening administrative power. How will the new and old personnel within the Yuan, many of whom are respected or have a long record of political achievements, concentrate and exert their abilities to fulfill their due responsibilities? This is our first hope.</p>
<p>Today, the most important issue facing us, which is sufficient to test the ability of this new central administration, is the issue of survival in the face of external threats. Since the Tanggu Truce failed to alleviate China's national crisis, it was followed by the North China Incident in June of this year and the recent Hebei-Chahar issue. The idea that no further concessions can be made and that concessions are useless has been widely understood. If we want to survive, we must have the means and ability to seek survival. If we want to coexist in the international community, we must prepare for those who do not allow us to coexist. Recently, critics attributed the external humiliation to the authorities' inability to "defend" after the Tanggu Truce. But how easy is it to defend? Without the means and ability, how can one defend with empty words? We do not want to hastily doubt the ability of the current new central administration, and we believe that it can have the means to cope with the serious situation. President Chiang of the Executive Yuan said in his speech at the Fifth Plenary Session that he would "never give up peace until peace is completely hopeless, and never lightly speak of sacrifice until sacrifice reaches the final juncture." How to prevent peace from becoming hopeless and how to avoid sacrifice will depend entirely on the new central administration's ability to handle foreign affairs. This is our second hope.</p>
<p>Turning to domestic affairs, the convocation of the National Assembly has already been scheduled by the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Since the National Crisis Conference passed the "Political Reform Proposal" in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), there have been attempts to convene a National Assembly, proposals to establish a National Political Council, and postponements of the National Assembly to open up political power. Although the disturbances have lasted for a long time, they have all come to nothing. In the past, the domestic situation was complex, and the administrative authorities could not be held solely responsible. Now that the party's central authorities have formally passed and announced the constitutional draft and the election process has been scheduled, the responsibility lies with the central administration and cannot be shirked. How to complete the election matters on schedule and how to ensure that the establishment of the National Assembly can live up to its name is also an important test of China's domestic politics. This is our third hope.</p>
<h3>The US Stops Buying Silver, Which Has a Major Impact; Shifts World Attention</h3>
<p>Nanjing – A certain financial expert said that the US Treasury Department's decision to stop buying silver in London has a major impact. The truth is out. Recently, the US speculated that it was due to our currency reform and the large-scale sale of silver in London. This was nothing more than an attempt to use this kind of propaganda to shift world attention away from the US silver purchase policy. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York – The Bank Journal published an article today mocking the US government's silver purchase policy. According to the newspaper, the policy has caused serious problems and is very inappropriate for a government that prides itself on its good neighbor policy. The government cannot ignore China's plight. China is now caught in a whirlpool of financial panic, all thanks to the US silver policy. In addition, Mexico, Peru, Canada, India, and other parts of the Far East have also been affected. (13th Kuomintang Telegram)</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Someone saw Feng Yuxiang at his residence in Sifangcheng. Feng was wearing a large blue cotton robe, only knee-length, a Qing wool bird hunting cap, and cotton shoes. Feng said that the weather in Jiangnan was unusually cold for early winter, likely due to excessive rainfall this year. He was concerned that in the flood-stricken areas, the disaster victims would suffer from both cold and hunger, and that an epidemic would break out next spring, causing many deaths. He also said that overly long clothes are inconvenient for movement, and if the Chinese shortened their long robes by one foot, the amount of material saved would be considerable and could be used for beneficial purposes. For buttons, cloth buttons could be used, utilizing leftover fabric scraps. Western-style bone buttons are both expensive and easily lost. The money saved on bone buttons each year could buy a bullet, which could be used against external enemies. He also said that he had just received a report from the north that Li Kechang, the commander of the Chahar-East Security Brigade, had died in battle. Li used to serve in the Northwest Army. The report mistakenly wrote Kechang as Kecheng. Li was from Luoyang. After graduating from middle school in 1917, he joined the Northwest Army's training corps and served as a company commander. In 1925, he was a battalion commander. He participated in the Nankou Campaign in 1926 and the Northern Expedition in 1927. Li was stationed in Luoyang, under the command of Shi Jingting. When the Anti-Japanese Allied Army was established in Zhangjiakou, Li served as the director of the ordnance depot and contributed to the recovery of Dolun and other places. Next year, Li followed the army to Mount Tai to form a military research class. Li was the class leader. This year, the Chahar-East Security Brigade was formed, and Song Zheyuan and Zhang Yunrong consulted with him. He ultimately died in service at the age of 26. His mother passed away last year, and he has six children. His family is in dire straits. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Kellogg, Initiator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Sees No War, Says Far East Situation Not Dangerous</h3>
<p>Washington. Kellogg, former US Secretary of State who initiated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, told guests here today that he did not think the situation in the Far East was harmful. He has not seen any signs of war there, nor has he seen any actions by Japan in China that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. He has not seen any reason to prove that a major war is about to break out. The world is indeed uneasy, but this is caused by economics, he said. Kellogg spoke of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, severely criticizing Italy and pointing out that Italy had no reason whatsoever. However, he did not believe in any sanctions. He believes that the world does not currently maintain peace through the implementation of sanctions. He also did not see the need for the United States to enact any further legislation on the issue of neutrality, he said. Secretary of State Hull met today with Earl, Governor of Pennsylvania, and Senator Guffey. It is heard that they discussed the issue of US neutrality, but Hull was unwilling to discuss the content of the conversation. It is widely speculated that this conversation must be related to the issue of embargoes on media and oil. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Germany to Return to the League of Nations, Negotiations to Begin Early Next Year</h3>
<p>London. When Foreign Secretary Hoare recently held talks in Paris with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, his main task was to negotiate a solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. In addition, there was another objective, which was the issue of Germany's return to the League of Nations. In this regard, British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps' audience yesterday with German leader Hitler was a prelude to negotiations between Britain, France, and Germany. These negotiations are expected to begin early next year. Former British Ambassador to Germany Phipps and French Ambassador to Germany Poncet had previously contacted Hitler, who replied that it would be more convenient to discuss this issue after the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was resolved. In addition to working to urge Germany to return to the League of Nations, the governments of Britain and France have two other objectives: first, to jointly conclude an agreement limiting land and air armaments; and second, to conclude a Sky Assistance Pact to supplement the Locarno Pact.

<h3>The Past and Present of Anglo-Egyptian Relations</h3>
<p>London - Lord Lloyd, former British High Commissioner to Egypt, recently delivered a speech at a dinner hosted by the British Indian Association, addressing the issue of restoring the 1923 Egyptian Constitution. He stated that the current situation is precarious, and Egypt's decision to alter its political system at this juncture is inherently dangerous. "In accordance with the principles of the declaration issued by the British government in 1922, the government cannot oppose Egypt's restoration of the constitution. However, the current situation is significantly different from that of 1922. Given the perilous strategic importance of the Mediterranean at this critical moment, it is extremely serious for Egypt to seek to negotiate and conclude a treaty with Britain." Lord Lloyd then referred to the treaty negotiated in London in 1930 between Egyptian representatives and the late British Foreign Secretary Henderson, stating that the treaty not only prohibited Britain from occupying Egypt by force but also placed all foreign interests in Egypt entirely under the jurisdiction of the Egyptian authorities. However, that treaty was rejected by Egypt at the time. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Amidst International Speculation: The Anglo-French Plan Announced - In Addition to Land Swaps and Boundary Adjustments, Southern Abyssinia is Granted to Italy for Development</h3>
<p>Rome - The Anglo-French peace plan, which has aroused speculation in European countries in recent days, was announced here last night. The plan is divided into two parts: the first concerns the exchange of territories, and the second concerns the economic concessions granted to Italy. The territory ceded to Italy includes the eastern Tigre Province, bordered by Hecuba to the south and a north-to-south line from Aksum to Adwa to the west. The holy city of Aksum remains Abyssinian, while Adwa is granted to Italy. The border between Eritrea and Danakil will be adjusted, with the town of Wossa in the south and a corner of territory granting Abyssinia access to the sea, belonging to Abyssinia. A new boundary will be drawn between Abyssinia's Wogadaen province and Italian Somaliland, bisecting the Webi Shebeli River at Iddiddu, extending eastward from Gorahei, and westward from Warandabait, ultimately connecting with the border of British Somaliland at longitude 45 degrees. All water sources within the territory ceded to Italy must be carefully protected for their original use. Abyssinia is granted access to the sea, either through the cession of the port of Assab or through the cession of a corner of land along the border of French Somaliland, at Abyssinia's discretion. The British and French governments will undertake to suppress the slave trade and arms trafficking within the territories ceded by Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The second section announces that the British and French governments will use their influence in Addis Ababa and Geneva to designate an area in southern Abyssinia for Italian economic development and immigration, bounded to the east by the revised border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, to the north by the 8th parallel, to the west by the 35th meridian, and to the south by the border between Abyssinia and British Kenya. This area remains an integral part of Abyssinia. The economic rights enjoyed by Italy within this area: The area will be managed by a privileged economic company or a similar institution. This company will have absolute property rights over unoccupied land and exclusive rights to exploit minerals and forests. The company must allocate a portion of its profits to the indigenous population for the economic development of the area. The administration of Abyssinia within this area will be assisted by personnel appointed by the League of Nations, working in conjunction with the Abyssinian emperor. This task may be managed by a single commissioner, who may be Italian. He will serve as the League of Nations' chief representative's agent at the Abyssinian court, provided that the chief agent is not a citizen of any bordering country. One of the main responsibilities of this auxiliary mission will be to guarantee complete freedom for Italians to conduct business in Addis Ababa and the designated area.</p>
<p>Before the Anglo-French plan was delivered to Italy and Abyssinia, it underwent significant revisions. The draft presented to Italy stated that the British and French governments would exert pressure on Abyssinia to accept the proposed chartered company, while the document presented to the Abyssinian government only requested its acceptance of the proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Joint Letter Simultaneously Sent to the League of Nations Secretary-General</h3>
<p>Geneva - The full text of the Anglo-French proposal for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, as well as the letter jointly sent by French Prime Minister Laval and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, has been released by the Secretariat. The letter stated that the British and French governments, in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations, have undertaken mediation efforts and have drafted a proposed solution, which was sent to the respective governments by their ambassadors to Italy and ministers to Abyssinia on the 12th of this month, in the hope that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute would thereby be resolved. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Releases White Paper: Statement on Foreign Secretary's Mediation Process</h3>
<p>London - The British government released a White Paper this morning containing documents related to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The impressions formed by diplomatic circles and the general public regarding the Italo-Abyssinian peace terms are unlikely to undergo significant changes as a result. The main documents in the White Paper are telegrams from British Foreign Secretary Hoare to the British Ambassador in Rome and the British Minister in Addis Ababa, containing urgent official letters conveying proposals to Italian Premier Mussolini and the Abyssinian Emperor. Their wording is nearly identical. The letters state that the British and French governments earnestly desire to see the Italo-Abyssinian war resolved through a compromise based on the requests made by Italian and Abyssinian representatives in Geneva on December 2, at the meeting of the Committee of Eighteen in Geneva on December 12. A majority of League members have diligently drafted the basis for a compromise during recent talks between Hoare and Laval. They earnestly desire to pay attention to those points that can make Italy's wishes compatible with the principles of the League Covenant, and at the same time, intend to respect Abyssinia's rights. They feel that arrangements should now be drafted under the guidance of the Committee of Five. They have decided to immediately submit certain proposals to the Committee. Furthermore, Laval and Hoare both earnestly wish to ascertain that Mussolini (or the Abyssinian Emperor, in the letter to Abyssinia) accepts this basis for negotiation in principle, without prejudice to the subsequent discussion results of the Committee. They have decided to strictly maintain confidentiality, informing the Committee of Five of the various proposals that their governments intend to make. The documents also earnestly state that if the recipient of this letter agrees to conduct negotiations with the Committee of Five under these conditions, they should reply as soon as possible. Finally, it states that the basis for a resolution intends to grant Abyssinia access to the sea, initially through a corner of the territory of Eritrean Assab. The British and French governments are willing to ensure that Abyssinia obtains access to the sea, as they have informed the Committee of Five. Hoare also sent a telegram to the British Minister in Addis Ababa on December 10, stating that you should use your utmost influence to persuade the Abyssinian Emperor to give careful and positive consideration to this proposal, and that it must not be rejected lightly. I dare say the Abyssinian Emperor can once again demonstrate his political skill, understanding the benefits and negotiating opportunities offered in the proposal, and be able to utilize them. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Reply: Still Requests Clarification on Several Points</h3>
<p>Rome - Mussolini today formally replied to the British and French governments, requesting clarification on several points in the Italo-Abyssinian peace plan. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome - It is anticipated that Italy's next formal step will be to request clarification on several points separately. Italy will not issue a definitive "acceptance or rejection" of the peace plan, but will make reservations regarding the cession of Assab to Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to well-informed political sources, the Italian government may accept the Anglo-French plan as a basis for discussion, but will raise reservations due to its "inadequacy." It is generally felt that the plan has reduced hopes for peace, as what is granted to Italy is far less than what it had hoped for. Mussolini's chances of accepting the plan are slim, and if he does accept it, it will be with significant reservations. Italians are very disappointed with the "small" scope of territory ceded to Italy, and will likely strongly oppose the cession of Eritrean Assab to Abyssinia. Furthermore, there are fears that the proposed economic development area will be easily infiltrated and invaded by Abyssinians. It is largely unknown whether the area's agricultural and mineral resources can be exploited, making it uncertain whether it is suitable for European colonization. However, Italians now acknowledge that the Anglo-French plan is not immutable. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome - Renowned journalist Gayda recently published an article in the Italian newspaper, commenting on the attitude expressed by the British and French newspapers. He stated that the current situation is by no means cause for optimism. The proposals put forward by Britain and France must satisfy Italy's demands and align with the principles upon which Italian policy is based. The general public should wait until Italy has clearly expressed its views before claiming that the situation has changed. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia's Request Denied: League of Nations Will Not Convene an Assembly, Issue Referred to Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>Geneva - The Abyssinian government recently sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, discussing the proposals put forward by Britain and France, and requesting the convening of an assembly, stating that "in addition to Italy's act of aggression, there is also a conflict between that country and the League of Nations." It also stated that "under the current circumstances, Abyssinia has a duty to avoid any action that could be construed as violating the authority of the League of Nations. Furthermore, the Abyssinian government has not thoroughly discussed the Anglo-French proposal, merely stating that Italy's act of aggression has been unanimously recognized by the League of Nations. Now, someone is attempting to disguise the request for Abyssinia to cede half of its territory under the pretext of exchanging territories, so that the aggressor can relocate a portion of its population. Before responding to this request, the Abyssinian government requests the immediate convening of the League of Nations Assembly for open discussion, so that all member states can express their opinions." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The Abyssinian government yesterday requested the convening of the League of Nations Assembly to discuss the proposed solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently issued a reply stating that the request will be considered after the League of Nations Council expresses its opinion on the matter next Wednesday. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The Abyssinian Emperor's request for the immediate convening of the League of Nations Assembly to discuss the Anglo-French peace plan has been rejected today by League of Nations Assembly President Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. Beneš stated that there is no need to convene an assembly because the League of Nations Council will discuss the matter on Wednesday. Opposition to the Anglo-French plan from small countries is spreading rapidly. Representatives of the small countries have now decided to unanimously reject the plan. The Committee of Eighteen met today and decided to postpone the implementation of the oil embargo against Italy before adjourning, pending a meeting of the Council. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council: Expected Not to Reject, Eden Still Making Strong Statements</h3>
<p>Geneva - British representative Eden stated to the Committee of Eighteen today that the British government will never slacken in its efforts to restore peace and maintain the authority of the League of Nations. The British government will provide all possible assistance to the work of the Committee of Eighteen to the best of its ability. Eden's remarks have created a powerful impression, as they imply that the British government does not wish to avoid or delay the expansion of sanctions. At the same time, the issue of convening the League of Nations Assembly to consider the Anglo-French peace plan has been shelved, pending further discussion at the Council meeting next Wednesday. Although there is currently general opposition to the peace plan, it is generally expected that the Council will not reject the plan sponsored by Britain and France. It is believed that this plan will pass with unanimous approval, although several countries may abstain from voting. The Council will likely seek to avoid a direct vote. Prime Minister Laval may suggest appointing a committee to study the plan. If so, progress will be slow, and the expansion of current sanctions will be postponed. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Tense Atmosphere in Geneva: Widespread Condemnation</h3>
<p>Geneva - The atmosphere here is extremely tense following the release of the Anglo-French proposal for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. League of Nations officials believe that all those around the world who support the League of Nations will be outraged, and that Abyssinia's determination to resist will be further strengthened. It is undoubtedly believed that if the League of Nations Council submits this proposal to the League of Nations Assembly for consideration, the majority of the 54 countries in the Assembly will reject the proposal. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Major Attlee, chairman of the opposition Labour Party caucus in the House of Commons, delivered a speech in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, discussing the Italo-Abyssinian issue, stating, "The solution proposed by Britain and France is a stain on British honor. Smaller countries no longer trust Britain's sincerity. From the perspective of the British public, Prime Minister Baldwin and his government have betrayed the British people, the League of Nations, and Abyssinia." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Lord Davies, representative of the League of Nations Union in London, recently introduced a motion in the House of Lords, strongly condemning any proposed solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute that grants concessions to the aggressor that are greater than what that country could have obtained through peaceful negotiations. The House of Lords is scheduled to vote on the motion on the 18th (Wednesday). (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Lansbury, an opposition Labour Party MP in the House of Commons, recently told the press, "The conditions proposed by Britain and France for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute are so harsh that they would be considered cruel even if a victorious nation were imposing terms on a defeated nation, let alone in a war where the outcome is still undecided. Given the current relationships between the member states of the League of Nations, I see no good solution, as the great powers are unwilling to consider the overall political and economic situation of the world, but only engage in maneuvering and haggling. I dare not believe that a satisfactory peace can be achieved in this way. I do not support sanctions; I support a ceasefire and exerting every effort to find a peaceful solution." He then repeatedly stated his belief that violence cannot ultimately achieve peace. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - The release of the Anglo-French peace plan has sparked criticism worldwide. The New York Times stated that millions of people in Europe and America are now saying that this cannot be done. According to reports from Delhi, Indian newspapers have unanimously attacked the plan, stating that it has become a scrap of paper, and that the Abyssinian Emperor and the entire world do not want it. However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the Deutsche Tageszeitung defended the plan, stating that the British and French proposal to Italy recognizes Italy's right to develop territory and seek raw materials, and that this is the first plan to implement Britain's promise. While the Paris newspapers do not believe that the plan has any chance of success, some right-wing newspapers have defended it. Le Journal and Le Petit Parisien share a similar view, stating that the plan does not grant special benefits to the aggressor, as the proposed cession of territory is no better than what was previously proposed. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - The Daily Telegraph commented on the Anglo-French peace plan today, stating that Prime Minister Baldwin had previously said that if he could freely express his opinion, the attacks from the opposition would cease. Therefore, public opinion should not rush to make a final judgment on the plan, but wait for the Prime Minister to explain his views. If the British government is certain that Italy will regard an oil embargo as a military sanction, and is certain that other members of the League of Nations are not prepared to deploy troops jointly to protect the covenant under Article 16 of the covenant, and only wish Britain to bear the brunt, then the government should make various facts clear to the people. The Morning Post claimed that public outrage has erupted over the Anglo-French plan to carve up Abyssinia to benefit Italy, and that the statements made by Eden and Laval in Geneva cannot mitigate this. The Daily Express stated that the notion that the plan is merely an exchange of land is false, and that this plan is a way to steal land and economic opportunities from the victims of planned aggression. The Times stated that the text of the peace plan has not lessened the anxiety that had already arisen. The summary of the plan previously published by the newspaper has now been substantiated by the full text. The initial summary of the plan had already caused an outcry in the British House of Commons and around the world, and the impression gained from reading the full text is the same as the impression gained previously. The original plan only seeks to offer half of Abyssinia's territory, ownership, and management to Italy. Apart from Italy, few parties are likely to welcome this plan. The Daily News stated that the full text of the plan has proven that the outcry is justified. In short, this plan is a complete surrender to Mussolini. The Daily Mail defended Baldwin, saying that the Prime Minister has convened a secret meeting of the House of Commons to fully inform them of all the facts. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Hoare Injured His Nose Again While Resting in Switzerland</h3>
<p>London - The British Foreign Office issued a statement today stating that British Foreign Secretary Hoare suffered an accidental injury to his nose after arriving in Switzerland and requires careful treatment. It is not yet known when he will be able to return to England. The Foreign Secretary intends to return to the country as soon as he is able to travel, but will definitely return to London before the House of Commons begins debating the Anglo-French peace plan. Britain's attitude towards the peace plan is to support its revision by the League of Nations. If the League agrees to revise it, there may be hope for a ceasefire in East Africa before Christmas.

<h3>Naval Conference Stalemate: Japan Seeks Extraconference Activities, Has Met with British Representatives Once, But Many Parties Harbor Thoughts of a Breakdown</h3>
<p>London - The naval conference has reached a stalemate today. Representatives from various countries are now privately considering the possibility of a complete breakdown. Some parties even believe that there is no point in reconvening on January 2 after Christmas. There are plans to announce a recess from December 21 to January 2. However, some parties also believe that Japan may agree to discuss secondary issues other than the issue of equality, in order to avoid being blamed for sabotaging the conference. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>London - The Japanese delegation held a private meeting with British representatives on the 13th, and plans to meet with American representatives early next week, followed by French and Italian representatives. The First Committee will transform into a secret meeting of plenipotentiaries from various countries starting next week. At the same time, representatives from various countries will conduct private meetings separately. Japan's policy has always been to advocate a common maximum, while proposing appropriate adjustments based on the different geographical and tactical conditions of various countries, and preferring private meetings to committee meetings, using private meetings to persuade representatives from various countries separately. (Japanese League Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Opposition to Japanese Equality Has Been Straightforwardly Explained</h3>
<p>London - Last night, the leaders of the British and Japanese naval delegations held a non-public meeting to exchange views. The British representative frankly explained the reasons for his opposition to naval equality. It is reported that British Chief of Naval Staff Chatfield explained the following key points to the Japanese representative Nagano: Naval equality would place Britain at a disadvantage in the Far East, because no matter what the situation in the Far East, a large portion of the British fleet must be stationed in European waters. Britain bears a heavy imperial responsibility, making it necessary to maintain a larger navy to protect equality and safety. Nagano replied that Japan also has territories and very long coastlines, and that modern warships are very fast, so the British navy could easily move its entire fleet to the Far East if necessary. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Although a statement was issued after the British and Japanese naval representatives met yesterday, it was vague. According to the Daily Telegraph, Naval Minister Viscount Monsell expressed his views to Japanese chief delegate Admiral Nagano, stating that "if the dangerous situation in the Far East worsens, the British navy that can be sent there to protect its national interests cannot exceed more than half of its total fleet. Accordingly, if Japan and Britain maintain equal naval forces, Japan's strength in the Pacific will naturally be twice that of Britain. Britain cannot practically maintain its vast interests. Given that this fact is obvious, the British Admiralty, regardless of who is in charge, will find it difficult to consider Japan's request for equal rights. Furthermore, Japan already possesses a large navy, and its strategic position is far superior to that of other countries, and it is less susceptible to naval attacks from other countries. Therefore, in terms of national security, there is no sufficient reason for Japan to demand equal rights. In addition, Japan has a theory that if the proportion of the navy it receives is lower than that of other countries, it would harm the nation's dignity. This argument is generally acknowledged, but taking Germany as an example, it is difficult to convince people. Germany is also a major country, and its self-esteem is no less than that of any other country, but it has signed a naval agreement with Britain, agreeing to limit its naval strength to 35 percent of the British navy. It has not been heard that Germany considers this humiliating." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - After the British and Japanese naval representatives met yesterday, a statement was issued stating that "Naval Minister Viscount Monsell and several key advisors from the British delegation met with Japanese representatives Admiral Nagano, Ambassador Nagai, and two advisors from that country to discuss the various issues currently under consideration by the First Naval Conference Committee." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Revise Opinion: French Navy Can Also Be Equal</h3>
<p>London - It was learned today that Admiral Nagano, the chief Japanese representative at the London Naval Conference, has revised his three-point request for a common maximum limit on naval forces, stating that Japan does not object to countries other than Britain, the United States, and Japan enjoying this common maximum limit. Representatives from British dominions immediately asked whether they had the right to enjoy the same naval forces as Britain. The debate ended inconclusively as a result. Some representatives believe that Nagano only wants France and Italy to enjoy the principle of equality. Nagano asked whether the British Empire was a single organization, or whether the various dominions considered themselves to be unrelated entities. American chief representative Davis spoke today, and all countries agreed on "equality of security." The needs of each country should be based on different geographical conditions and responsibilities. Japan's proposal ignores the principle of different geographical conditions. Monday's meeting is scheduled to allow only chief representatives from each country to speak. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The naval conference opened this morning. The Japanese delegation made an unexpected statement, saying that Japan is willing to apply the common maximum limit not only to Britain, the United States, and Japan, but also to France and Italy. The Japanese delegation made this statement because the French representative had yesterday issued critical remarks, saying that France should not be constantly ignored. American representative Davis stated that Japan's proposal does not change America's view. America believes that the needs of each country are different, and this point must be considered. The Japanese representative replied that there are indeed differences in needs between some countries, but that the needs of Britain, Japan, and the United States are the same. The naval conference has now been adjourned until Monday. At that time, the conference will be of a non-public nature, and will only include the chief representatives from each country. Japanese representative Matsuzo Nagai explained Japan's attitude towards the naval conference to a Reuters reporter today in a concise statement, saying that the common maximum limit should be set very low, so that no country would have surplus strength to attack another country. Japan, at least, wants to reduce naval expenditures as much as any other country. It is reported that the French representative was quite satisfied with the explanation of the Japanese representative's proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Compromise on French Opinion: Inside Story According to a Certain Newspaper</h3>
<p>Paris: A certain newspaper, reporting on the peace talks between French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare, stated that the United Kingdom, during a certain stage of the Paris negotiations, made concessions due to the possibility of war with Italy. The Italian Ambassador to Paris, Cerruti, reportedly told Laval that imposing an oil embargo on Italy would be tantamount to declaring war. Laval relayed this to Hoare, adding that France did not wish to participate in the embargo and that the French fleet could not be mobilized within two weeks. Hoare, realizing that he could not obtain immediate assistance from the French fleet in the event of a break with Italy, decided to compromise on the peace plan to accommodate French opinions.

<h3>Song Zheyuan to Convene Meeting with Political Committee Members</h3>
<p>Discussion on preparations for the establishment of the Political Committee</p>
<p>He Yingqin has already left Beiping and returned south</p>
<p>Fighting outside Guyuan City continues</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Following the announcement of the list of members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, the situation appeared to ease on the surface. Song Zheyuan, recuperating at Yangyunxuan in the Summer Palace, met with reporters on the morning of the 12th and made the following remarks: "Some people have said that I have had certain dealings with the Japanese, which is a great slander. From the time I relinquished my position in Chahar on June 20th until I took up my new position as the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison on September 20th, I only met with the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, Tada Hayao, once. I have not met with any other Japanese people. Later, due to the situation, I was compelled to meet with key Japanese officials, but I never discussed any concrete issues." When the discussion turned to the new administrative structure of Hebei-Chahar, Song expressed that he did not want two types of people to participate in the Political Committee: those who would betray the country and those with a sullied reputation in society. He hoped that those who were out of office but had a sense of responsibility would come forward to serve the country, while at the same time advocating that those currently in office should avoid participating. When asked about the future of diplomacy in North China, Song replied that everything would be discussed openly and that there would be no behind-the-scenes dealings. Finally, Song addressed the handling of the East Hebei puppet organization, expressing that progress should be made quickly and peacefully.</p>
<p>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin finally decided to return south at 10:00 AM on the 12th. Chahar Chairman Xiao Zhenying and Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun, upon hearing the news, immediately went to Jurentang to meet with He and request instructions. They then left the city to report to Song at the Summer Palace. Song then entered the city at 12:30 PM and went directly to Jurentang to meet with He for talks, leaving after 3:00 PM. At 3:30 PM, He visited the Palace Museum to view the artifacts donated by Ferguson. He returned to Jurentang at 5:00 PM and attended a banquet hosted by Song at Wuyikuhutong at 6:00 PM. At 7:00 PM, he returned to Jurentang and boarded a train at the West Railway Station at 8:00 PM. Before departing, he appointed his senior staff officer, Yan Kuan, to remain in Beiping to handle liaison matters. Before his departure, He, having read foreign newspapers that constantly referred to the so-called Hebei Agreement, had his confidants convey the truth about the Hebei negotiations to the press, using the declaration of former Japanese Army Commander Umezu as proof, in order to dispel the baseless rumors from abroad.</p>
<p>The number of members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee was initially planned to be 36. After the National Government announced 17 names, certain authorities here indicated that those not yet announced would be submitted to the government for approval to be retained, and vacancies would be filled as needed. The original site for the committee was the east and west buildings of the former Yingbinguan (Guest House), but after an inspection, it was found to be insufficient, so it was proposed to use the site of the former Military Affairs Committee as the committee's headquarters. Preparations will begin as soon as the procedures are completed. The date of the committee's establishment is generally within this month. Chairman Song Zheyuan will convene a meeting of the committee members within days to discuss preparations. Committee member Wang Kemin telegraphed from Shanghai, expressing his unwillingness to take office. Zhe also telegraphed the central government on the 13th, requesting to be relieved of his duties in order to recuperate. Wang Yitang once telegraphed to resign, but Chen Yi went to Tianjin on the evening of the 12th to personally persuade him to stay, and it is hoped that he will withdraw his resignation.</p>
<p>At noon on the 13th, someone visited Song at Wuyiku to discuss the current situation. When the discussion turned to the issue of the East Hebei puppet organization, Song stated that, in any case, within the scope of his authority, he would find a way to make Yin Rugeng voluntarily abolish the existing illegal title. According to well-informed sources, the authorities here have decided on the steps to take in dealing with the East Hebei puppet organization. Once the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee is established, they will begin to handle it. According to a telephone call from Tongzhou on the evening of the 13th, Yin Rugeng is paying close attention to the atmosphere in Beiping. However, he has recently been busy with "bandit suppression" within the "district" and is also taking advantage of his special position to build highways. Most of the materials and planners come from outside the customs. According to someone who returned from an inspection in Tongzhou, the county's normal schools for men and women have been occupied by the Japanese army since their closure, giving the impression of being in foreign territory. If the East Hebei problem is not resolved quickly, the future hidden dangers are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Government Chairman Shang Zhen and Tianjin Mayor Cheng Ke have successively submitted their resignations due to illness, which have been approved by the Central Government, with Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying succeeding them respectively. It is reported that Shang had long intended to leave office and had instructed his subordinates to expedite the winding-up process during his sick leave. Shang still expressed his intention to resign regarding the new appointment to govern Henan, and has telegraphed the Central Government, earnestly pleading and firmly requesting to leave. His 32nd Army Headquarters also moved south from Beiping on the 13th. The new Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying, upon receiving the telegram from the Central Government, also telegraphed Beijing on the evening of the 12th, expressing his humility. According to a Tianjin telephone call, Song Bao-yi, who was sent by Xiao to Tianjin to handle important official matters, arrived in Tianjin at noon on the 13th. Xiao himself had a telephone conversation with Liu Yushu, the director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, to make inquiries. It is generally speculated that Xiao will take office in Tianjin in the near future. Song Zheyuan expressed his humility regarding the new position as Chairman of Hebei Province when he met He Yingqin on the 12th. He encouraged him to devote himself to the country and take on the difficult task. Therefore, Song has decided to first send Men Zhizhong, a former member of the Military Affairs Committee, to Baoding within days to handle the handover procedures. Song telegraphed the Central Government on the morning of the 13th, recommending candidates for the new department committees. After the National Government appoints them, Song will set a date for taking office. Before taking office as Chairman of Hebei Province, he will first take office as Director of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office, as it relates to the maintenance of security in Hebei and Chahar. At that time, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters will be abolished in accordance with the Central Government's order.</p>
<p>The North China situation is quite exciting due to the confirmed personnel changes. The diplomatic issues rumored among the public seem to have eased on the surface, but how the attack on Guyuan by the puppet army will be handled remains to be seen. The other side's request that Guyuan, Duolun, Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, and Huade six counties be garrisoned by the Mongolian Security Force organized by the Mongolian Political Council concerns the survival of Chahar, and it is assumed that the authorities will not accept it. Currently, the puppet army's attack on Guyuan is still ongoing outside the city, and rumors of a negotiated solution are unreliable. At the same time, Kita, the head of the China Department of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, arrived in Tianjin on the 13th to convey orders from the Japanese Central Military Department. Future developments are brewing within, so the overall situation in North China is still far from optimistic. (13th)</p>
<h3>Beiping University Students Strive for National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Most Universities on Strike, Public Security Bureau Forbids Parades</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The national salvation movement of Beiping university students has not diminished. The principals' orders to persuade them have not been effective. Details from various parties are as follows:</p>
<p>Student National Salvation Guidelines</p>
<p>A committee member of the student union stated that the union is currently conducting national salvation work in many ways. They will hold a second major petition soon to express their opinions to influential people. They will send representatives south to contact universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guangxi, Wuhan, and other places to unite for national salvation. They will launch a general petition to the central government with universities across the country. They will publish a general declaration, translated into English, French, German, and other languages, and send it to universities and governments in various countries to elicit sympathy. As for the date of the strike, it cannot be predicted at this time. In short, it will continue until the goal of ultimate victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Principals' Persuasion Methods</p>
<p>Xu Songming, the president of Beiping University; Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University; Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University; Li Zheng, the president of Normal University; Li Linyu, the president of Sino-French University; Lu Zhiwei, the president of Yenching University, etc., held a luncheon at the European and American Alumni Association on the 13th. During the meal, they had a detailed discussion on the aftermath of stopping the student strikes at various schools. It was said that the schools had already issued notices separately, advising students to resume classes. To date, many students have obeyed and attended classes, but many others are still watching and waiting. Therefore, without effective specific measures, it will not be a good solution. It is now urgent to find a method that is suitable for the current environmental conditions, uses persuasion, and at the same time allows all parties to reach an understanding, in order to calm the student activities. The final discussion resulted in each school first trying to find ways on its own and examining the results. A gathering will be held later to discuss further.</p>
<p>Strike Situation in Various Schools</p>
<p>Li Zheng, the president of National Normal University, went to the classrooms of the Faculty of Arts at 8:00 AM on the 13th to inspect and had some words with the registration staff. He then issued a notice, which read: "A notice was previously issued prohibiting the obstruction of teachers from teaching and students from attending classes. Upon inspection, this is still happening. It is hereby notified to the students that if they do not repent and continue to engage in such behavior, they will be expelled from the school upon investigation. This notice." It has been found that the Faculty of Education has gone on strike. Peking University has also posted a notice by the president, the gist of which is that students must not act rashly and that anyone found inciting a strike will be immediately expelled from the school. However, students at the school still neglected classes on the 13th. According to President Jiang Menglin, rumors that he will be going to Nanjing recently due to some relationship are completely untrue. In addition to advising students on the current student movement, he also strictly prohibits them from engaging in external activities. Xu Songming, the president of Beiping University, convened a temporary administrative meeting on the 13th, attended by Xu Shoushang, the director of the Women's College; Bai Pengfei, the director of the College of Law and Commerce; Liu Yunchou, the director of the College of Agriculture; Zhang Yihui, the director of the College of Engineering; and Wu Xiangfeng, the director of the College of Medicine, to discuss ways to persuade the students. As a result, it was decided that each college should issue a notice to the students, prohibiting them from striking. At the College of Law and Commerce, students in the third and fourth grades of the first department attended classes on the 12th, while students in the second grade of the second department and the first grade of the third department were still on strike. On the 13th, all classes were on strike. Female arts and sciences students at the College of Engineering held meetings separately on the evening of the 12th and, as a result, did not strike, but issued a declaration expressing their opposition to the puppet autonomy. At Tsinghua University, President Mei Yiqi and the heads of various departments advised students on the evening of the 12th not to strike and not to be swayed by rumors. On the 13th, President Mei went to the city to discuss matters with the presidents of various universities in the city. Zhu Qiming, the principal of the First Municipal Women's Middle School of Beiping, found it difficult to prevent students from striking and submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that she was resigning due to illness. The bureau sent Li Yingyu, the school's director of studies, to temporarily serve as acting principal on the 13th.</p>
<p>More Students from Northeastern University Arrested</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Northeastern University has moved from Shenyang to Beiping to continue its operations. Students at the school have always been at the forefront of the patriotic movement. Now, for some reason, facing the school authorities, they have promulgated emergency measures to deal with the strike issue: Students must attend classes. Leave will not be granted for any reason. Students who are ill must have a certificate from the school doctor. Attendance will be taken by Wang Guan personnel for class, self-study, and bedtime. Anyone who does not attend attendance on time will be considered to have violated school rules. Students who continue to be absent from class without permission will be demoted to self-funded auditors from the next semester. Students who are absent from class without permission will be expelled from the school. Anyone with one of the following circumstances will also be expelled from the school: 1. Interfering with other people's classes; 2. Interfering with teachers and staff in the performance of their duties; 3. Holding meetings without permission; 4. Damaging school equipment and property; 5. Other acts that endanger public safety or order. After the measures were announced, many student leaders at the school were arrested, and their whereabouts are unknown. Therefore, students have gradually resumed classes, but many are still active in secret. On the evening of the 13th, a meeting was held somewhere, and the resolutions were not made public.</p>
<p>Normal University Students Hold Meeting</p>
<p>The Normal University Student Union held a representative meeting on the 13th and passed various resolutions: 1. The school's patriotic work will be handled by the executive committee. 2. The school's decision to continue the strike was decided to be consistent with the Student Association and other schools. A declaration was also issued. 3. The school's plan on how to handle students who attend class without permission was decided that representatives from each class will be responsible for persuading. 4. The executive committee will ask the school to file a record. 5. An emergency motion was passed that all students will support students who sacrifice themselves for the patriotic movement and group service.</p>
<p>Notice Prohibiting Parades</p>
<p>The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau recently posted a notice prohibiting parades by university students, which read: "Currently, the situation is unstable, and it is the winter defense period. Local security is extremely important. All unauthorized gatherings, parades, lectures, distribution of leaflets, slogans, etc., are most likely to cause misunderstandings and disturb the public. All regulations are strictly prohibited. Currently, there are young students who are listening to rumors, gathering crowds to parade, distributing leaflets, and not listening to prohibitions. The motives of these students may be excusable, but their actions are close to causing disturbances.

<h3>Hidden Dangers in Southern Hebei Counties</h3>
<p>Instigation of Rebellion in Twelve Counties Including Xingtai, Riot by Treacherous People in Renqiu Quickly Resolved</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In the southern part of Hebei Province, in twelve counties including Julu, Nangong, Pingxiang, Yaoshan, Renxian, Neiqiu, Jize, Gaoyi, Shahe, Guanping, Lincheng, and Xingtai, people were found promoting the idea of anti-communist autonomy a week ago. A large amount of firearms and ammunition were secretly transported from Tianjin and distributed to treacherous people as preparation for an attempt to riot. The Feixiang area, because its activities were not within these twelve counties, was detected by the county government, which secretly reported to Sun Dequan, the commander of the 319th Division stationed in Daming, under the command of Wan Fulin's 53rd Army. Sun ordered his troops to search and arrest more than ten leaders, thus suppressing the trouble before it could materialize. However, the preparations for autonomy in the twelve counties, including Julu, fearing that they would be prevented by the authorities, are accelerating their efforts and intensifying their actions. Although Shang Zhen has considered resigning, he considers local security to be paramount. He ordered Li Xingcun, the director of the Provincial Security Department, to rush to Xingtai on the 7th of this month and summon the county magistrates of the twelve counties, including Xingtai and Julu, to gather in Daming on the 10th of this month to hold a joint defense and village cleaning conference. It was decided that the military police teams of each county would cooperate to search for reactionary elements to prevent the occurrence of false autonomy. It is also planned that after the 32nd Army moves south, the troops that are being deployed will assist in eradicating unstable elements. Li himself will temporarily reside in Xingtai to direct the operation. The false autonomy in each county may not occur, but Renqiu County suddenly, on the 7th of this month, with treacherous people and gentry Liu Feipeng and former security team leader Ma Debiao as leaders, contacted Zhao Jingyu and Li Qingguo, former brigade commanders of a certain army, and team leader Yang Qi, secretly gathering more than two thousand ignorant people to surround the county seat and petition. County Magistrate Li Tianmin, hearing the alarm, quickly led the county police team and security team to close the city gates to defend. However, the deputy commander of the security team had a secret agreement with Ma Debiao and disobeyed orders, opening the city gates and letting the rioters in. The county magistrate, the director of public security, and the commander of the security team were arrested and imprisoned in the county government. Ma Debiao's wife, Wang Lianqing, organized a propaganda team and promoted autonomy along the streets. For a time, various agencies in the city were occupied by the rebels. The city gates were closed, and telephones and telegrams were cut off. On the 8th, the treacherous people organized a puppet maintenance association, with Ma Debiao as chairman. Liu Feipeng, Zhao Jingyu, and Li Qingguo occupied the Finance Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Security Team Headquarters, respectively, and declared themselves directors or team leaders. After receiving the report, Shang Zhen immediately ordered the Tang Guoliang regiment of his 32nd Army, stationed in the two counties of Xiongba, to rush to suppress them, hoping that the rioters would withdraw from the county seat and resolve the situation peacefully. After the regiment arrived, they learned that the rioters had four machine guns and hundreds of rifles, and that there were foreigners among them. Therefore, in resolving the situation, they were hesitant to act rashly and reported to Shang Zhen for instructions. Shang ordered Chen Dongsheng, a counselor at the Tianjin Office, to negotiate with a certain party and send several military police to bring back the people mixed in. Ma Debiao and others lost their support. At the same time, more than a thousand special police officers from the First Regiment of Special Police stationed in Cangxian, led by Regiment Commander Ma Deji, rushed to assist the Tang Regiment. The treacherous people realized that it was difficult to fight the enemy and fled in secret. By the 10th, there were no traces of rioters in the county. County Magistrate Li Tianmin and others were freed. The special police entered the city to deploy and were ordered to garrison the area. A riot was quelled. (12th)</p>
<h3>Tao Luqian Resigns from Internal Affairs Position</h3>
<p>Tao Luqian, Acting Minister of the Interior, and Xu Xiuzhi, a permanent decision-maker, submitted their resignations yesterday. Tao's letter stated: "I, Luqian, am unworthy and unskilled, yet I was unexpectedly promoted to a crucial and difficult position, assisting in civilian affairs and temporarily managing departmental affairs. Since taking office, almost a year has passed. Although I have tried my best, my efforts have been hampered by circumstances, and I have seen no results. I am daily exhausted by paperwork and running to meetings, which does not benefit the party or the country. I am deeply ashamed. Now, as the central government reorganizes and implements comprehensive reforms, I deeply consider the words of offering my services and fear the warning against holding a position without contributing. I respectfully request permission to resign from the position of decision-maker for the Ministry of the Interior, to avoid further mistakes. I await orders with apprehension."</p>
<p>Songjiang: Huangliangbang Robbery in Fengjing</p>
<p>Robberies have occurred repeatedly in various districts south of the Huangpu River. Since the water patrol team dispatched ships to patrol and the security brigade sent a detachment to station in the Jinshanwei, Caojing, and Shanyang areas, the bandits have somewhat restrained themselves. Unexpectedly, another robbery was reported in the Fengjing area. Around 12 o'clock the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of villager Jin Caigen in Huangliangbang, Wuwu Temple, Fengjing. Two of them carried firearms, and the rest held bayonets. They broke down the door and entered the house. Six or seven of them rushed into the bedroom, dragged the homeowner out, tied him up, and silenced him. They then divided up to search and rob the house. After looting the valuables, they kicked Jin Erguan and his younger sister, injuring them, before fleeing with the loot. It is estimated that they stole over ten silver dollars, gold rings, silver necklaces, silver locks, silk fabrics, over twenty pieces of clothing, and one dan of rice, resulting in a loss of over a hundred silver dollars. The case has been reported to the district office and the public security bureau, who have requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Smuggling of Children's Organization Cracked</p>
<p>Recently, cases of child abduction have occurred frequently in Suzhou. The public security authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Tang, a police officer from the Fifth Precinct, learned that Li Zixin, at No. 43 Xiatang, mentioned that some Cantonese merchants staying in his inn were involved in a child abduction ring. On the afternoon of the 13th, at 8 PM, he led police officers to search the premises. They arrested five people from Guangdong: Li Zixin, Li Rongxuan, Li Zhangshi, Zhang Heshi, and He Lishi, as well as two abducted children from Suzhou, Yusheng and Mugen. They also arrested Liu Jintang, the introducer, at No. 5 Sanyuan Lane outside the gate. All were taken to the station and interrogated overnight. They confessed to the abduction. On the 14th, they were transferred to the general bureau and sent to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Plan to Promote the Prosperity of Wuxi-Cheng Industrial Commerce</p>
<p>Jiangyin, located at a crucial point on the Yangtze River, is rich in natural resources. Recently, the Wuxi-Chengjiang and Zhenjiang-Chengjiang roads have been completed, and the Huangtian Port was successfully dredged last year, greatly improving transportation and increasing commercial prosperity. Two years ago, the Zhenjiang Customs established a sub-customs office in the county. However, commercial wharves located in Jingjiang, across the river from Jiangyin, could not directly import tung oil, kerosene, grains, cotton yarn, sugar, hemp, and other goods needed by the counties south of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Chengyi Chamber of Commerce requested Liu Hongsheng, the current general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai, to ask the Kailuan Mining Company to build a wharf in Chengjiang. The location is excellent and can accommodate merchant ships of over 10,000 tons. The coal needed by various factories in Wuxi is transported from Jiangyin to Wuxi, no longer detouring through Zhenjiang, which has proven to be very effective. Recently, the Ministry of Finance decided to abolish the sub-customs office in Nantong on January 1 of next year, as Nantong is not a treaty port. At the same time, the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Ministry of Finance to designate Jiangyin as a cargo stacking area, allowing all merchant ships to dock on the south bank of Jiangyin to promote commercial prosperity. The wharf would be the Kailuan Company's wharf. The Ministry of Finance approved the petition and dispatched Li Guirong, the Zhenjiang Customs Commissioner, and his secretary, Lu Bingyao, to Jiangyin to inspect the sub-customs office and the Huangtian Port dredging project. Accompanied by Wu Liying, Chairman of the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce, Li and his entourage visited Wuxi yesterday to inquire about the state of Wuxi's industry and commerce, as well as its products and exports. They then visited the Lixin and Qingfeng factories before returning to Chengjiang in the evening.</p>
<p>Fire at Tianlai Sugar Warehouse</p>
<p>The Tianlai Sugar Warehouse, located under the bridge outside the North Gate, was established by Dai Tongsheng and others. Business was average. Unexpectedly, around 8 PM the night before last (the 13th), a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse's kitchen, filling the area with thick smoke that broke through the roof. It was uncontrollable and spread to the rear of the Ruitai Chang Tea Warehouse. After receiving the alarm, fire brigades from various sections immediately rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire. In total, one house was burned down, with losses estimated at two to three hundred yuan. It is reported that the Tianlai Sugar Warehouse had fire insurance of over 30,000 yuan with insurance managers Zhang Renshan, Hu Guanjie, and Cao Zuocai. When the fire was raging, the Rixin Silk Shop used its "Taiping" water dragon to extinguish the fire at Tianlai, but the Tianlai staff dared to stop them, which caused complaints from nearby residents.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Hard Currency Recovery Involves Pawnshops</p>
<p>The Xixiashu Patrol Team of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Wuyi Public Security Bureau arrested Wang Wanxian and Geng Taikun, two suspects involved in the recovery of hard currency, in the town on the 27th of last month. They seized over 1,200 paper dollars and 66 silver dollars. They were handed over to the county government for interrogation. After the facts were confirmed, they were transferred to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for questioning. The Garrison Headquarters ordered the Public Security Bureau, led by Chief Inspector Wu Shengfang, to go to Benniu Town with the town mayor to conduct a detailed search of the Hengyuan pawnshop's iron cabinets and counters. No hard currency was found. Zhou Xiaopu, the person in charge of the pawnshop, and Zhou Haoquan, the clerk, as well as a copy of this year's foreign currency general ledger, were taken to the sub-bureau, along with Yu Boqin and four other police officers who handled the original case, and sent to the city bureau. After a preliminary hearing, they were transferred to the county government on the 13th and then to the Zhenjiang Police Department for investigation on the 14th.</p>
<p>Nantong: Remedy for Detaining Opium Addicts</p>
<p>The number of male and female opium addicts in the counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong is extremely high, and the prisons and detention centers are insufficient to accommodate them. The county magistrates have decided to establish a detention center in a suitable location in Nantong to hold opium addicts from the district with longer sentences. They will also increase the number of opium addicts who can work in factories in each county to ease the situation. Commissioner Xu has telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department for approval.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Investigate Commerce</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs believed that Nantong was not a treaty port and should not be allowed to load and unload goods. They sent a special representative to reside at the Tianshenggang wharf to inspect the goods and issue inspection certificates. Merchants would then take the certificates to the Jianghai Customs or Zhenjiang Customs to pay taxes. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to abolish the Nantong sub-customs office on January 1 of next year. Considering Jiangyin's strategic importance on the Yangtze River, the Ministry of Finance ordered Li Guirong, the Zhenjiang Customs Commissioner, and his secretary, Lu Jingtang, to come to Chengjiang on the 12th to investigate. After meeting with Wu Shuying and others from the Chamber of Commerce, they inspected Huangtian Port. The first step will be to allow Jiangyin ships to dock on the south bank to load and unload goods. The second step will be to establish a sub-customs office to become an inland commercial port. On the 13th, Li and his secretary went to Wuxi and Wu counties to investigate and prepare for the development of Jiangyin.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Education by Gu Shusen, Director of the Department of General Education, Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>In my previous speech on "compulsory education," I have already discussed the meaning of compulsory education, the general situation of compulsory education in various countries around the world, and why we must urgently promote compulsory education. Today, I will continue to discuss the progress of compulsory education in our country, the status of implementation of compulsory education in various provinces and cities this year, and my opinions on promoting compulsory education.</p>
<p>The promotion of compulsory education in our country can be said to have already started in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, feeling the pressure of external forces, we had to vigorously promote reform, establish schools, and promote education. Regarding compulsory education, ten articles of compulsory education regulations were formulated and sent to various provinces, but they were merely words on paper and were not actually implemented. The regulations stipulated that the age for children to enter school was seven. The number of schools to be established in each province was as follows: 100 elementary schools in each provincial capital, with 5,000 students; 40 elementary schools in each prefecture, state, and county, with 2,000 students; and one elementary school in each town, with 40 students. Small villages could combine several villages to establish one school. Regarding incentives for establishing schools, those who enthusiastically promoted the establishment of more schools would be rewarded. Regarding compulsory attendance, the parents or elder brothers of children who reached the age of admission but did not attend school would be punished. Upon close examination, although these regulations did not have concrete measures, if the provinces and regions could have implemented them earnestly, a considerable foundation for compulsory education could have been established.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, the former elementary schools were renamed primary schools, and the length of study was set at four years, which was the length of compulsory education. However, the procedures and detailed measures for implementing compulsory education were not specified.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Republic of China, an order was issued to prepare for compulsory education, and 31 articles of procedures for implementing compulsory education were defined, which included surveying school-age children and dividing school districts. At that time, due to the domestic political turmoil and wars, only Shanxi Province began to implement it, while most other places failed to promote it.</p>
<p>In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the National Education Federation resolved to petition for the promotion of compulsory education. Later, the Ministry of Education formulated measures for the promotion of compulsory education, stipulating that it would begin in the Republic of China year and be completed by the Republic of China year seventeen. At that time, feeling the difficulty of implementation and the difficulty of resolving it, the Ministry of Education established a Compulsory Education Implementation Research Association and consulted various provinces to establish similar research associations to study and discuss various issues.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. Based on item 13 of the domestic policy of the Chinese Kuomintang's political program, "promoting popular education," and item 6 of the Local Autonomy Implementation Law, which stipulated that education was a right of children, it paid close attention to the promotion of compulsory education. The National Education Conference in the seventeenth year advocated the establishment of compulsory education committees in the central government, provinces, regions, counties, and cities to assist educational administrative organs and promote compulsory education. The Third National Congress in the eighteenth year also made a decision to vigorously implement compulsory education. In the same year, the Third Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang passed a resolution to vigorously implement compulsory education, instructing the Central Training Department to formulate a plan, regulations, and implementation procedures jointly with the Ministry of Education, and to achieve it by the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Based on this proposal, the Ministry of Education formulated a preliminary plan for implementing compulsory education. This plan included clear regulations on the distribution of compulsory education funds, teacher training, and the addition of school buildings at the central, provincial, and local levels.</p>
<p>In the spring of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education convened the Second National Congress to formulate a plan for implementing compulsory education. The content of this plan, in addition to stipulating that the length of compulsory education would still be four years, allowed for flexibility or shortening of the study period for poor children. Other aspects, such as teacher training, the establishment of experimental zones, the addition of classroom measures, and budget estimates, were planned in detail. At that time, the Ministry of Education also statistically analyzed the number of children attending school nationwide, which accounted for only 218% of school-age children. They also felt that rural primary schools in various places were underdeveloped, so they issued measures to increase the number of students in rural primary schools and measures to promote primary education in prosperous cities. In June of the twenty-first year, they promulgated short-term compulsory education implementation measures and the first phase of the compulsory education implementation outline, ordering various provinces to consider local conditions, formulate detailed plans, and actively implement them on a trial basis. A total of eighteen provinces submitted plans to the ministry, but for three years, due to the failure to fully raise funds, the results were not significant.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know that in the past, since the establishment of the National Government, experts from all over the country have gathered to study the promotion of compulsory education, and the government has issued laws and regulations to promote it vigorously, but the actual effect has not been significant. The reasons for this are probably three points:　Difficulties in raising funds;　The four-year term is too long and difficult to implement in a short period of time;　The basic organization is not sound, so there is a lack of responsible people to promote compulsory education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education, based on the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, re-formulated the Provisional Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education and submitted it to the Executive Yuan on May 28 of this year for promulgation and vigorous implementation. The important points of this resolution are that, in terms of funding, in addition to the central government allocating large subsidies, it also requires local governments to effectively raise funds on their own. In terms of school establishment and length of education, from the 24th to the 28th year, short-term primary schools with a one-year system will be widely established within five years. During this period, children aged nine to twelve must receive at least one year of compulsory education. From the 29th to the 33rd year, within five years, all one-year short-term primary schools should be changed to two-year systems, and children aged eight to twelve must receive at least two years of compulsory education. From the 34th year, the two-year short-term primary schools will gradually be changed to four-year primary schools. During the first and second phases, the original private schools will be reorganized and improved, circuit teaching will be tried, the number of ordinary primary schools will be increased appropriately, ordinary primary schools will be limited to adopt a two-part system, and the number of students in the original ordinary primary schools will be increased. In addition, regulations are also stipulated for dividing primary school districts. One primary school district is based on an average of 1,000 people, and each district must have at least ten short-term primary schools, and one school director must be set up to preside over the establishment of schools, fundraising, surveying students, and compulsory enrollment in the district, as the basic unit for implementing compulsory education. In addition, compulsory committees at all levels must be established from the central government to the provinces, cities, and counties as organs to assist in the implementation of compulsory education. Other detailed regulations on all aspects of implementation have also been promulgated successively. Therefore, the implementation of this resolution can be said to be very concrete and practical, avoiding the past drawbacks of empty talk, in order to achieve the goal of universal compulsory education.</p>
<p>The implementation of compulsory education this time is very smooth. Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the implementation measures, the provinces and cities have been able to raise funds and plan for implementation. The total amount of compulsory education funds raised by the provinces and cities this year is more than 11 million yuan, plus the central subsidy of 3.2 million yuan, totaling about 15 million yuan. All provinces and cities have reported their implementation plans to the Ministry for filing, except for Guangxi Province, which is still proceeding according to the original plan and has not formulated a new one. The number of short-term primary schools established and reported by the provinces and cities, as well as the short-term primary school classes attached to the institutions and schools, together with the ordinary primary schools that have been added and the grades that have been expanded in the original primary schools, total 50,000 schools and more than 20,000 grades. It is estimated that the number of students enrolled this year will be 3.3 million. If the increasing funds in the future can have a definite and stable source, then the predetermined period of universalization will not be difficult to achieve in each phase.</p>
<p>Based on the plans and various implementation situations reported by the provinces and cities to the Ministry of Education, Shandong Province has been the most rapid in raising compulsory education funds this year, because they previously had two military funds, totaling 850,000 yuan, which have now been transferred to this year's compulsory education funds, so it is of course easier to start. Therefore, all their plans and facilities are handled by the Provincial Department of Education, and they are working hard to make rapid progress. According to the predetermined plan, the province will establish a total of 3,270 short-term primary schools and 483 short-term primary school classes attached. The short-term primary schools in Jiangxi Province are attached to Bao Li primary schools. Their funds, in addition to the 100,000 yuan allocated by the province, are all raised by the Bao according to their responsibilities. According to reports, a total of 1,555 short-term primary schools have been established, 9,838 short-term primary school classes attached to Bao Li primary schools, and 474 grades have been added to ordinary primary schools. After investigation, Jiangxi Province has suffered from the occupation of communist bandits, and the local area has been severely affected by disasters. Although the bandit disaster has now been cleared, the original strength has not been restored, but they are working hard to implement miscellaneous education without reservation. Such hard work is really not easy. The compulsory education facilities in Guangxi Province are different from other provinces. They establish schools in neighborhoods, which are also called national basic schools. According to the report from the Department of Education, more than 13,000 schools have been established before, and more than 11,800 schools will continue to be established this year. The funds required are entirely planned by each county, and the average recurring expenses required for each school are 200 yuan per year. Other provinces and cities have detailed plans, and due to time constraints, I have not been able to report them in detail one by one. Now they are probably all actively implementing them, and most of them are working hard. This is a good phenomenon that has never happened since the promotion of compulsory education for more than 20 years. Therefore, in order to accurately understand the implementation situation in the provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education has dispatched a large number of inspectors to go to the various provinces and cities to inspect on the ground. Taking this opportunity, if there are any difficulties in the facilities in the provinces and cities, or if the central government has any guiding opinions on the facilities in the province, they can be earnestly resolved.

<h3>University Presidents Meet with Mayor Wu Yesterday to Discuss Patriotic Movement; Political and Academic Authorities Decide on Two Principles and Actively Prevent Dangerous Incitement</h3>
<p>Except for President Li Zhaohuan of Jiaotong University, who was unable to attend due to illness, other university presidents in the city, including Weng Zhilong of Tongji University, Li Denghui of Fudan University, Ou Yuanhuai, Vice President of Daxia University, Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University, He Bingsong of Jinan University, Chu Fucheng, Dean of Shanghai Law School, Shen Junru, Dean of Academic Affairs, Xiao Youmei, President of the Conservatory of Music, Sun Xiaolou and Yan Shixiong, representatives of Soochow University, Zhu Gongjin, representative of Guanghua University, Chen Mengyu, President of East Asia College of Physical Education, Nong Ruihui, representative of Sino-French Institute of Technology, and Yan Kechang, representative of the Academy of Fine Arts, and more than ten others, met with Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government around 11 AM yesterday. On behalf of the Shanghai education community, they expressed their opposition to the pseudo-autonomous movement in North China, mainly focusing on the following points: Maintaining administrative unity, territorial integrity, opening up freedom of speech, and making diplomacy public. In addition to promising to report these opinions to the Central Government, Mayor Wu also made some explanations regarding the North China issue, stating that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee had been announced, and the North China issue had come to an end. The Central Government was adhering to the principles of administrative unity and territorial integrity, while also taking into account the facts to seek appropriate solutions, which was no different from what the students hoped for. The purpose of the student movement in Peiping was to oppose the pseudo-autonomous movement in North China. Now that the North China issue has been resolved, it is said that students in Peiping have also stopped demonstrations and accepted the advice of the government and school authorities, taking the overall situation into account and returning to classes as usual, taking a calm and attentive attitude towards the current situation. The patriotic movement is an expression of national consciousness, and the student movement is a precursor to the national movement, which is not blameworthy and has always been advocated by us. However, it must be well-led. Otherwise, in the complex relationship of diplomacy and domestic politics, if actions are not carefully considered, they often unknowingly become seduced by complex environments or controlled by those who have other political purposes. The result is not only not what was originally expected, but may even be beyond expectations. Subsequently, Chu, President of Shanghai Law School, Liu, President of Shanghai University, and He, President of Daxia University, spoke successively and exchanged opinions with Mayor Wu. After the Municipal Government and the school authorities reached a consensus, it was decided that the student patriotic movement must be jointly and actively prevented from dangerous incitement by the Municipal Government Party Department, the school authorities, and the students of each school, and must not violate the following two principles: No strikes and no marches. The presidents and others talked until around 1 PM before taking their leave from the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Labor Union Cables Central Government to Vigorously Punish Rebels, Eradicate Them and Protect Our Territory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union cabled the Central Government yesterday, requesting a clear order to vigorously punish the rebellious Yin Rugeng. The original text reads: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee and the National Government: Since Yin Rugeng claimed autonomy and occupied eastern Hebei, betraying the country and undermining unity, the people of the whole country have been pained by the imminent loss of the country and filled with grief and anger. Our government authorities, in order to maintain the integrity of territory and sovereignty, are determined to fight to the death, and immediately issued an order to dismiss and arrest the rebellious Yin. The news spread, and we were extremely grateful. However, more than ten days have passed, and we have not seen a single soldier from the Central Government dispatched, allowing the rebellious Yin to be arrogant and carefree. As a result, rioters in Renqiu have continued to cause disturbances, and autonomy in North China is still brewing. At this critical juncture of national crisis, if we continue to tolerate this heinous traitor who harms the country and the people without immediately suppressing him, where is the rule of law, and where does the law of the country exist? And how can the Central Government (your government)'s clear order to dismiss and arrest him be justified? The people of the union cannot bear to see the sinking of the mainland and are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered country. We dare to offer our sincerity and express our humble opinions, begging your Excellency (government) to dispatch elite troops to launch a vigorous punishment as soon as possible, eradicate them and protect our territory. Our union vows to lead 800,000 workers in Shanghai to be the government's backing. We are extremely panicked by this urgent cable. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Ye Xianggao, Qiu Xubai, and Long Peiyun, respectfully bow. Seal."</p>
<h3>First Special District Municipal Federation Sends Two Important Cables Yesterday</h3>
<p>The First Special District Municipal Federation of this city sent cables to Song Zheyuan in Peiping yesterday, asking him to express his attitude towards the political situation in North China, and also sent cables of condolence to Chairman Shang Qiyu in Baoding, hoping that he would uphold the spirit of struggle to stabilize the national situation. The original cables are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cable to Song Zheyuan: "To General Song Zheyuan, Commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison: Our country is an independent and complete nation. Territory and sovereignty belong to the Central Government and must not be occupied by any forces. Your Excellency's loyalty and patriotism in the Battle of Xifengkou and the Battle of Chahar will be remembered for generations. Since taking office as the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, due to the pressure of the environment, the Yin Rugeng incident in eastern Hebei occurred before, and the North China situation is brewing organization after. When the news spread, people were outraged. People from all over the country have risen to demonstrate to express their opposition, reflecting a glimpse of the will of the people, as the country's survival is at stake. Your Excellency's difficult situation can be understood by the people of the country. However, for this kind of organization that falsely claims autonomy and acts as an accomplice to the tiger, you should absolutely refuse to do so in order to be worthy of the people's trust, and you must never delay and mislead the country, leaving a bad name for future generations. We respectfully inform you by cable and hope that you will express your attitude to reassure the people. The First Special District Municipal Federation of Shanghai respectfully bows. Cold."</p>
<p>Cable to Chairman Shang: "To Chairman Shang Qiyu of the Hebei Provincial Government: The people of the whole country have long admired your Excellency's loyalty to the country. This Yin Rugeng has forged public opinion and organized autonomy in eastern Hebei, betraying the party and the country to the extreme. Your Excellency has upheld the orders of the Central Government and took the lead in criticizing him, which was met with unanimous approval. We have heard that the Central Government has appointed your Excellency as the Chairman of Henan Province. We hope that you will prioritize national affairs and take office as soon as possible. We also ask that you uphold your original proposition of saving the country, refuse to participate in any pseudo-organizations, and encourage the three armies to launch a crusade. Our association, as a citizen group in the special district of Shanghai, will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and is determined to mobilize all sectors of the country to unite in support and provide backing. We send this cable of condolence and hope that you will uphold the spirit of struggle. The First Special District Municipal Federation of Shanghai respectfully bows. Cold."</p>

<p>Since the so-called autonomous movement in North China occurred, students in Beiping have made patriotic petitions, and students in various regions have responded one after another.

Details of the situation in each school are recorded below:</p>
<p>National Salvation United Association of University Students</p>
<p>University students in this city, recognizing the increasing urgency of the national crisis and the deepening national humiliation, believe that it is difficult to save the country and ensure its survival without the public exerting its power to assist the government. Finally, students in Beiping and other regions have successively sent telegrams to demonstrate their feelings, and public sentiment is excited. Students from various schools in Shanghai are all filled with righteous indignation and have held meetings to respond. In order to demonstrate the power of unity and coordinate steps, student representatives from Fudan, Jinan, Zhong Gong, Datong, and other universities initiated the organization of a city-wide university student association a few days ago, with many joining.

We hereby inform you of this. Shanghai University Student National Salvation United Association respectfully. Cold. Also, a quick mail telegram says: To all compatriots throughout the country: The national crisis is increasingly urgent, and national humiliation is increasingly deep. For the past four years, pseudo-organizations have instigated pseudo-armies to invade the eastern territory of the Chahar Province, and have also forcibly violated public opinion and threatened local areas, using the name of autonomy to covertly annex North China, the birthplace of our nation. They are pursuing their traditional continental policy, pressing upon us step by step, intending to encompass our entire territory and destroy our national life. All of us in the country, from top to bottom, have endured humiliation and swallowed our anger, sacrificing countless things, and we can no longer endure it. Therefore, people from all regions and students from all provinces are either sending telegrams and appeals or holding demonstrations and petitions, hoping to seek national survival from a position of near death. We express our deep sympathy for this shared sense of righteous indignation, and we are even more willing to rise up together, vowing to emulate Wang Yi's courage in serving the country with a spirit of fearlessness, acting as the vanguard of the people and the backing of the government, to resist the aggression of the violent and firmly oppose all conspiracies that undermine national unity and territorial integrity, and reject the false "goodwill and cooperation." We must thoroughly eradicate the actions of traitors who betray the country. As for the pseudo-autonomous organization, we respectfully request the government to discuss it quickly in order to preserve the integrity of the national territory and vent the public's anger. The nation's survival is imminent. Talking about peace is no longer possible. There is no way to survive without gathering the strength of all compatriots in the country and coordinating our steps. We hope that we will be of one heart and one mind, with a firm will, and fight to the end. This association vows to lead all the enthusiastic young people of Shanghai and act as the vanguard. We hereby declare this. Shanghai University Student National Salvation United Association, December 14th.</p>

<p>The Annual Closing of Accounts is Approaching: Measures to Relieve Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sent a Notice to Members Approved by the Ministry</p>
<p>Both Banking and Money Industries are Preparing to Close Accounts</p>
<p>The Three Banks Control Foreign Exchange with Success</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The time for the annual closing of accounts for various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China is approaching rapidly. The money industry will hold its winter managers' meeting the day after tomorrow to prepare everything. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has notified its members that the Ministry of Finance has decided on measures to relieve industry and commerce. The three banks' control of foreign exchange has been quite successful. Details are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>The Banking and Money Industries Prepare to Close Accounts</p>
<p>The annual closing of accounts for various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China is approaching. The Money Industry Association will hold a winter managers' meeting at 2:00 PM on the 17th to discuss and prepare for the closing of accounts, and will hold an executive committee meeting on the 24th to determine the date for the closing of accounts. The Bankers Association will hold a regular members' meeting on the 28th to report on association affairs. Various banks have been very busy handling internal closing matters in recent days. Due to the complexity of collection and remittance, the Shanghai money market foreign exchange spread was consistently one jiao and one fen in both the morning and afternoon markets yesterday.</p>
<p>Measures to Relieve Industry Already Determined</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified its members yesterday: Respectfully, on November 25th, we received a letter from the Shipping Industry Association requesting that various industries be convened to discuss petitioning the government to quickly establish special banks and determine the lowest interest rate in order to relieve industry, etc. At the 70th standing committee meeting, it was resolved that the request to convene various associations should be temporarily postponed, and the case should first be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and action, and letters should be sent to various industries to solicit opinions, etc. This has been done separately. On the 14th of this month, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zi No. 8106: "I have been informed of the submission. The Ministry is actively preparing to establish a real estate mortgage bank. In order to activate land credit, we have submitted another request to the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative and Judicial Yuan to revise the real estate mortgage laws and regulations so that land and factory bases and factory property can be easily mortgaged. As for determining the lowest interest rate, it has an important relationship to the development of industry and commerce, and the Ministry has ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to gradually implement it based on the social and economic situation. In order to improve the current financial system and facilitate the development of enterprise, the Ministry is currently drafting and revising various financial laws and regulations, and has also consulted with the Central Bank to expedite the re-discounting of bills in order to facilitate the circulation of funds. In order to regulate industrial finance and support the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce, it has also been decided on four items for the overdraft methods of the industry and ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to follow them. Please take note," etc. Accordingly, we send this letter of notification. We hope you will take note. Best wishes for your health, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, December 14th, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Control of Foreign Exchange Quite Effective</p>
<p>After the Central, China, and Communications Banks lifted restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, it has been quite effective. Foreign silver prices have fallen drastically, but the exchange rate for telegraphic transfers announced daily by the Central Bank of our country is still very close to the standard amount. For example, yesterday's announcement was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence for every national currency in London, 29.75 US dollars for every 100 national currency in New York, 450 francs for every 100 national currency in Paris, 73.5 marks for every 100 national currency in Berlin, 103 yen for every 100 national currency in Japan, and 93 Hong Kong dollars for every 100 national currency in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Low Foreign Silver Prices, Lower Balancing Tax</p>
<p>Since the United States stopped buying silver, the price of silver in the London market has fallen. Although our country's industry and commerce are not affected, the balancing tax rate announced daily by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee has had to be lowered accordingly. For example, the tax rate announced at 10:00 AM yesterday was 41.25%, which is about 10% lower than before.</p>

<h3>Quan Shaowu Speaks: Hopes for Two Points from the National Media: Awaken the Public to Work Hard for National Salvation: The Strengths of the Chinese People Should Be Publicized Internationally</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Quan Shaowu, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, and inquired about the recent situation in the north. According to him, the situation in the north, on the surface, does not seem to have any special manifestations. He himself went to Tongzhou and there were no special circumstances either. However, the situation is actually very serious. He believes that no matter how serious the national situation is, public morale cannot be extinguished. Therefore, he hopes that the national media will awaken the national public to rise up and work hard for national salvation. He also hopes that the national media, in addition to awakening the public, should publicize the strengths of the Chinese people internationally.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Salt Farmers in Yuyao Continue to Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shang Cailian and other representatives of salt farmers in Yuyao continued to petition the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office yesterday morning. Their petition states: We are submitting a petition concerning merchants oppressing salt farmers, colluding with clerks, and preventing orders from being carried out. We humbly beg you to issue a strict order to continue collecting 40% of the salt quota to alleviate the people's hardship. The Yuyao salt field collects 381 catties of salt per plate, and the salt price is 8 jiao and 4 fen per dan. Since the Yuantai and Gongxing Zhexi four salt merchants in the five prefectures of western Zhejiang took advantage of last year's bumper harvest, they have suppressed the price to 8 jiao per dan this year. Salt farmers, considering their livelihoods, have reluctantly accepted this. However, since then, they have become even more unscrupulous. The Huaiyun Division collects salt at a 60% rate, and the salt farmers' livelihoods are repeatedly suppressed, creating a dangerous situation. The situation is urgent. Representatives, acting on behalf of the salt farmers, petitioned your office on the 22nd and 25th of the previous month. We were received by an official who conveyed the order that the fixed quota should not be reduced, that 60% would be collected temporarily, and that the remaining 40% would be collected after the transfer division instructed the salt farmers, etc. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Yuyao to report. The people were at ease, waiting for the order to be implemented. Unexpectedly, two weeks have passed, and the order has not arrived at the salt farm. The merchants are still suppressing the collection of salt. There must be collusion with the clerks, causing repeated delays and preventing the order from being implemented within the year. Salt farmers rely on salt for food. The end of winter is approaching, and the year is coming to an end. They are crying from cold and hunger and may resort to desperate measures. The matter is a cause for concern. The representatives have no choice but to appeal to your office again, requesting you to investigate and punish the offenders, and to order the merchants not to prevent the order from being carried out and to continue collecting 40% of the salt quota in order to maintain the livelihoods of the salt farmers. We will be eternally grateful. Respectfully submitted to Zhu, the Director-General of the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office and the Director of the Salt Affairs Office.</p>

<h3>The New Life Movement Association on Two Railways Donates to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways sent a letter to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces on Yunnan Road, saying: The floods in various provinces this year have been extremely severe. Our association previously received a letter from the General Association for the Promotion of the New Life Movement, instructing us to focus our work on disaster relief and epidemic prevention. We have always instructed the New Life Labor Service Teams in various sections to follow these instructions and proceed with the work. Furthermore, considering that our colleagues have already been fundraising through the Party Headquarters, and the Central Government has decided on a method for public officials to donate salaries, and that local charitable organizations also make contributions from time to time, this time we will focus on collecting used clothing so that disaster victims can use it to keep warm. Since the beginning, up to the present, we have received a total of 1,578 pieces of used clothing, as well as 201 yuan and 1 jiao and a half in national currency, 25 jiao in small foreign currency, and 94 copper coins. We deeply know that a cart of firewood and a cup of water cannot help with the difficulties of the time, but we hope that the smallest contribution will bring some relief. We are sending the above-mentioned clothing and money to your association for distribution to the disaster areas to benefit the disaster victims. We are endlessly grateful. Frugality and saving disaster victims is the main aim of the New Life Movement. The fact that the association takes the lead in advocating this shows their concern for the disaster victims and their eagerness to provide relief, which is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Provides Instructions on Doubts about Stamp Duty on House Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Tao Jinchang Rongji Estate Agency yesterday to provide instructions on doubts about stamp duty on house tickets, saying: We received your letter of the 13th of this month inquiring about the stamp duty on house tickets. We understand. We now reply as follows: The Stamp Tax Law is a law applicable throughout the country and is not specifically stipulated for Shanghai alone. Shanghai uses house tickets to collect rent, while the rest of the country mostly uses rent books. Therefore, this item is like the regulation that Zhoubu records should be used as a basis for collecting rent. There is no so-called ambiguity. This item only stipulates that if a record book is used, stamp duty should be paid according to the example of record books in the fourth category of this table. The single-page house ticket is not included in the fourth category. It should be taxed according to the regulation in the first category of the table. The meaning of the text is very clear, and there is no need for any further doubt. The tenth category of this table stipulates that stamp duty should be paid 2 fen for each item, not 2 fen for every certain amount of money. It is not intended to be incrementally added. The meaning of the text is also very clear. The notice is a pre-notification of rent collection and does not have any explicit stamp duty provisions under the law. Therefore, it does not need to be stamped. If the tenant insists, you can reason with them. If the tenant's claim is correct, the homeowner who issues the notice will be penalized, not the tenant.</p>
<h3>Chinese Institute of Engineers: Newly Elected Shanghai Branch Officers; General Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday with a Lecture by Mr. Zhixue</h3>

Our Institute of Engineers should gather the abilities of engineers to help the government, help industrialists, and help the people, to revitalize industry. I am honored to be elected and will always follow you all and do my best, and so on. Afterwards, Mr. Lu Zhixue was invited to lecture on the Chinese soap industry. Mr. Lu displayed various soap raw materials and described in detail the methods of manufacturing soap, especially the soap-making method of the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, with detailed charts, statistics, and sample instructions, proving the excellence of Guben Soap, which surpasses imported products. Afterwards, many attending members who were experts in applied chemistry discussed methods for improving soap making. The meeting adjourned at 11 o'clock.</p>

The Java Company liners, which sail to Java and the South Sea Islands, have decided to reduce passenger fares from Shanghai to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Luzon. This has already been reported. It is now learned that Shanghai to Xiamen has been reduced from 85 yuan to 70 yuan for first class, to Hong Kong from 110 yuan to 100 yuan, and to Luzon from 175 yuan to 140 yuan, starting with the Zhini Jiala liner.</p>
<h3>Survey of Living Standards of Public Servants: Shanghai Municipal Council Expresses Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is responding to a request from the Pacific International Institute to conduct a survey of the living standards of public servants in the Council and other institutions of equal status. This matter is currently being handled by the Council's Factory Investigation Group in cooperation with the International Institute. In the near future, public utility companies and organizations will be invited to join this survey. The original plan of the director of the Research Group of the International Institute was to investigate and compare the living standards of people in various countries. The part related to Shanghai is the salaries and living expenses of certain levels of personnel in the Council and personnel in public utilities. The Council will try to obtain statistics on those who have a cooperative relationship with the Council. It is also reported that the authorities in various Far Eastern countries have received this request, and the survey work has already begun in Tokyo, Japan.

<h3>Land Bureau Stipulates Submission Procedures: Regarding Property Rights and Disputes, Security and Seals Required, with Impression</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau's handling of land survey and certificate exchange often involves property rights disputes and boundary disputes. The Land Bureau has now revised its procedures and issued a special announcement, the text of which is as follows: It has been found that in the past, the Bureau has handled important cases involving people's requests, claims of property rights, and resolution of disputes. The names of the submitters were either marked with crosses or signed with flourishes, and sometimes the signatures did not match. There was no seal as proof, nor was there security from shops as evidence. Such perfunctory handling is prone to lead to fraudulent practices. In order to prevent such abuses, it is decided that in the future, when people submit documents to the Bureau claiming property rights or complaining of other disputes, they must have the seal of a reputable shop as security on the first document submitted, and the submitter must also submit their personal seal. In the future, if there are follow-up submissions or when receiving documents upon conclusion of the case, this will be used as the basis to ensure solemnity and eliminate malpractices. This announcement is hereby issued to all property owners in the city, who are requested to comply accordingly. This special announcement is issued on the 24th day of the 12th month of the 24th year of the Republic of China by Cai Zengji, Acting Director.</p>
<h3>Taifeng Canned Foods Company: Preparing to Resume Operations; Soliciting Priority Shares to Repay Old Debts in Installments Over 10 Years</h3>
<p>The Taifeng Canned Foods Company, located at No. 83 Nanjing Road, was forced to suspend operations last December due to debt. Creditors filed lawsuits in court, demanding that the company's assets, totaling over 700,000 yuan, be sold to repay the debts. After the court summoned the parties several times, some shareholders of the company stated that debts owed to them by others were sufficient to offset the debts. The company's business was generally good, and they urgently wanted to resume operations, so they requested a settlement. After the court convened a meeting of creditors in accordance with settlement procedures and passed the settlement plan, it was immediately approved. The company's board of directors appointed Deng Ruiren, Chen Zemin, Li Hanhua, Zhong Ruiqi, Li Enpu, and Cui Xiaoting as members of the resumption preparation committee to actively prepare for the resumption of operations. According to a reporter's investigation, the resumption plan includes reducing the company's original capital of 300,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan and soliciting an additional 200,000 yuan in priority shares. All old debts of over 500,000 yuan will be repaid in installments over 10 years, with the company repaying 55,000 yuan each year. Currently, more than half of the new shares have been subscribed, and the opening will take place as soon as they are fully subscribed.

After the meal, Chairman Cao Yunxiang gave a speech, followed by a lecture by Zhisheng on "Labor Issues," with Xie Chongshan as the recorder. The main points of the speech were: First, he described the seven important proposals discussed at the current International Labor Conference: 1. Maintaining the acquired and vested rights to disability, old age, and widowhood insurance for workers who move from one country to another; 2. Prohibiting women from working underground; 3. Youth unemployment; 4. Labor recruitment in colonies; 5. Paid vacations; 6. Reducing working hours; 7. Amending the convention on limiting coal miners' working hours. Among them, with regard to the sixth item, the labor side demanded a 40-hour work week, which was mostly opposed by the capital side. Although a few countries have since recognized it, it is feared that it will still be difficult to implement in practice. Finally, he said that during his inspection of Nanyang, he felt that overseas Chinese were quite welcome to national products.

<h3>Zhang Chongfu's Lawsuit Against Liu Huizhi: Criminal Case Halted, Proceeding to Civil Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Chongfu of Hangzhou purchased 1,000 shares of the China Industrial Bank in the past. After Liu Huizhi, the general manager of the bank, retired, Zhang accused Liu of engaging in private gain and embezzlement of public funds during his tenure as general manager. He hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Liu in the First Special District District Court, accusing him of embezzlement and breach of trust. After several court sessions, witnesses were summoned, and the account books of Hengshun Real Estate Company, founded by Liu, were subpoenaed for review.

<h3>Foreign Monk Zhaokong Denies Requesting Exemption from Examining Female Corpse's Lower Body</h3>
<p>The Second Special District District Court replied to the Tiantai County Government that the foreign monk Zhaokong, along with his male and female disciples, had gone to Tiantai Mountain in Zhejiang Province to offer incense. When they stayed at a certain temple, his disciple, a female nun named Daoda (transliteration) from Germany, suddenly committed suicide. After the mountain police and security personnel reported the case to the Tiantai County Government and requested them to send someone to examine the corpse, Zhaokong submitted a request to exempt the examination of the deceased's lower body. Later, the German Consulate learned of this and requested Tiantai to investigate. However, Zhaokong had already left Tiantai Mountain with his disciples, and his whereabouts were unknown, making it impossible to investigate. Recently, the Tiantai County Government saw a report in the newspaper that Monk Zhaokong was involved in a defamation case in the Second Special District Court in Shanghai, in which he accused the Russian-language "Chai La Wan Bao" of damaging his reputation. Knowing that Zhaokong was in Shanghai, they sent a document to the Second Special District Court entrusting them to summon Monk Zhaokong to the court to inquire about the reason why he had requested to exempt the examination of the deceased's lower body at that time. The Second Special District Court issued a subpoena and sent a police officer to deliver it to the office of Russian lawyer Sheng Min at No. 12 Fada Road, scheduling the inquiry for 2 p.m. yesterday. Zhaokong received the subpoena and arrived at the court at 3 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by lawyer Sheng Min. Judge Li Changnian questioned him in the Second Criminal Court. Because Zhaokong spoke French, the translator Chang Wenhuang provided interpretation. According to Zhaokong's confession, he denied requesting to exempt the examination of the deceased Daoda's (transliteration) lower body. The court verified the confession and instructed that a letter be sent back to the Tiantai County Government for verification. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Abducting Young Girl to Sell, Arrested: Met Cui Xiqing on the Way and Handed Over to the Law</h3>
<p>Yu Huangshi, a woman from Zhenjiang, had a fruit stall at the Taikoo Steamboat Wharf on the Bund. Her home was at No. 11 Guanyinge, Xinkaihe. She had a daughter, Yu Maotou (five years old), who was quite clever. She loved her like the apple of her eye. Cui Xiqing, who also had a fruit stall at the wharf, was unemployed and corrupt because he did not work hard and often associated with bad people. He often chatted with Yu Huangshi. A month ago, Yu Huangshi went out on business and left her daughter Maotou at home. Cui Xiqing happened to come and, seeing that she was not there, had bad intentions. He tricked Maotou into going out to buy candy and abducted her without a trace. When Yu returned home and did not see her beloved daughter, she searched everywhere for her, but there was no trace of her. At first, she did not know that Cui had abducted her. However, Cui, along with his accomplices Wang and Zhang, hid Yu Maotou in the countryside of Xujiahui after abducting her, waiting to sell her. However, Maotou cried day and night, arousing the suspicion of the landlord, who secretly reported the case to the police station in charge. Yu Maotou and the two abductors, Wang and Zhang, were all arrested and taken into custody. After questioning, the girl confessed her address. She was then escorted to the General Bureau for legal action. Maotou was taken back by her mother, and the family was reunited. However, the main culprit Cui Xiqing was on the run. A few days ago, Yu's adopted son, Jin A'er, met Cui Xiqing on the road and immediately called the police to arrest him and take him to the Old North Gate Police Station for investigation. After investigating, Director Shen found that the case involved the abduction of a girl and was extremely illegal. He escorted him to the Bureau for legal action.</p>

<h3>Japanese Police Intercept Huge Amount of Cash at Huishan Wharf Yesterday: Totaling 242,262 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, at 10:30 a.m. on the 14th, when the postal ship "Tatsuta Maru" was about to leave Huishan Wharf, the police station of the Consulate General suddenly dispatched a large number of officers to severely crack down on the smuggling of cash. Twenty minutes before weighing anchor, they ordered 139 passengers, mostly silver shop operators, to disembark. These people then elected several representatives, claiming that most of them had purchased group tickets and that all their luggage had been packed the night before and moved to the ship's warehouse. The authorities considered this a deception and, under the command of Officer Yamazaki, removed all the luggage from the warehouse and piled it on the open space next to the second rest area of the wharf. After checking each item, it was found that all 190-odd suitcases, wicker trunks, and beer crates were extremely heavy and full of cash. The authorities then called out the owners of each item and informed them of the appropriate punishment. Among them, two women were carrying as much as 11,400 yuan, while the smallest amount was 1,000 yuan and the average was about 5,000 yuan, totaling 242,262 yuan. The Japanese authorities immediately took the four elected representatives, Kusano, Aikawa, Takada, and Ishimaru, to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Pirate Nakamura Sueko Was Escorted Back to Her Country Yesterday; Japanese Newspaper Records Her Brief History</h3>
<p>A young Japanese woman, Nakamura Sueko, only 26 years old, committed robbery of merchant ships and kidnapped people for ransom in the seas of our Nanyang region, with countless victims. Recently, due to strict pursuit from various parties, the bandit fled to Xiamen and hid in an inn. Initially, no one knew, but due to financial difficulties and unpaid lodging fees, she was exposed. The hotel authorities reported this to the Japanese police, who arrested her. The Japanese Consulate in Xiamen, after consulting with its government and receiving a reply, ordered the female bandit to be escorted back to her country for interrogation. The Xiamen Japanese Consulate then telegraphed the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, stating that since Xiamen had no direct ships to the Orient, the bandit was dispatched with police escorts on the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Shengjing Maru to Shanghai, and then transferred to a Japanese mail ship to return home.</p>
<p>Departed Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, the female bandit was escorted by the Shengjing Maru and temporarily detained at the Japanese Consulate, with several police officers assigned to guard her. The bandit confessed in detail to her robberies in Nanhua and past robberies to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai. The Japanese Consulate has now agreed with the Japanese Mail Steamship Company and specially presented the female bandit yesterday, dispatching many Japanese police officers to escort her onto the Ryuta Maru, sending her back to her country. She departed Shanghai at 3 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Nakamura Sueko</p>
<p>Brief History of the Female Bandit</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the beautiful and talented female pirate Nakamura Sueko, who occupied Nanri Island in the Jianfu Qing County area and robbed passing merchant ships, was arrested by the Japanese Consul General in Fujian and escorted to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the story of her half-life is briefly described below: Sueko graduated from Kutsugata Elementary School in Rishiri County, Soya Branch Office, Hokkaido, in Taisho 3 (Republic of China Year 3). In April of the same year, she entered the teacher training course in Mashike Town, Rumoi County, and obtained a teacher's license. In the summer of Taisho 5, due to disagreements over marriage, she reluctantly left home and became acquainted with Zheng Wencai, a silk merchant from Fuqing County, Fujian, who was an overseas Chinese. Later, Zheng received news of his father's death and hurriedly returned to China. Sueko also decided to follow Zheng to China. Sueko was very well-liked by Zheng's mother and stayed in the countryside. Zheng returned to Japan alone. Later, Sueko was kidnapped by pirates on her way to Japan and became the concubine of the pirate leader Chen Changlin. In May of last year, Sueko led the pirates to rob merchant ships traveling between Haikou, Fuqing County, and Fuzhou in Pingtan County, obtaining over 7,000 yuan in foreign currency and kidnapping one passenger, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. From the 9th to the 7th, she robbed four sailing ships and three steamships, obtaining over 40,000 yuan in foreign currency. She was then attacked by the Chinese army and fled from Nanri Island to Xiamen. In the autumn of the same year, she indulged in extravagant entertainment with the pirate leader Chen in Tokyo. Sueko, feeling homesick, returned to her hometown alone. However, due to her deeply ingrained pirate habits and violent temper, she was despised by the villagers. Knowing that she was not welcome in the country, she suddenly appeared in Shanghai in March of this year and secretly returned to the pirate den. Not long after, the pirate leader Chen Changlin was arrested by government troops and beheaded in Fuzhou. Because Sueko was Japanese, she was spared from punishment. She then came up with a wild idea and opened a casino in Fuzhou, also working as a prostitute. The Japanese Consulate in Fuzhou ordered her expulsion, and she was escorted to Shanghai by the Shengjing Maru, preparing to be sent back to her brother in Yokohama.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Jimeng and Minghua Laojiu Cohabit Again, Committing Adultery; Old Romance Rekindled After a Triangular Meeting; Arrested in Court While Sound Asleep in the Early Morning</h3>
<p>Zhuang Jimeng, the young owner of Zhuangyuan Dazao Workshop in Dongxi Huade Road, Hongkou, Ningbo native, was arrested by the Second Special District Local Court last year due to his involvement in the case of the theft of a large sum of money from Xue Mailuo's accounting office. After being found not guilty and released, he has repeatedly been criminally sued in the First Special District Local Court for issuing bad checks over the past year, which remains unresolved. Now, he is accused of cohabiting with the prostitute Minghua Laojiu from Shantou Road, and his legal wife, Zhuang Zhang Yuexing, reported him to the police for adultery. This morning, Zhuang and the prostitute were arrested by the police and escorted to the First Special Court for investigation. The details are recorded as follows: Zhuang Jimeng, 22 years old, married Zhang Yuexing, a woman from his hometown, on February 14, Republic of China Year 20. At the time of their wedding at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, Zhang was already 19, one year older than Zhuang. After their marriage, the couple lived together on the upper floor of the Zhuangyuan Dazao Workshop. Their relationship was initially harmonious. It has been only nine years since their marriage, and they already have four children. However, in recent years, Zhuang suddenly became dissolute and fond of visiting brothels. Minghua Laojiu, originally surnamed Feng, is a famous Shanghai prostitute. She is 18 years old and was listed on the Shantou Road prostitute registry. Zhuang first met her on March 17 of last year, and they fell in love at first sight. By April 3, they had sworn an oath of eternal love. After the Dragon Boat Festival, Zhuang ordered her to close her business and rented a house on Parker Road to hide her. The prostitute's mother also came to live with Zhuang. From then on, Zhuang established an outer residence and did not return home at night. His wife, Zhang, became suspicious and investigated, only discovering in March of this year that her husband had a secret affair. She confronted him sternly, and Zhuang, knowing that he was in the wrong, held a "triangular meeting" with his legal wife and the prostitute at the Yangtze Hotel on the 18th of that month. At the meeting, it was agreed that Zhuang and Minghua Laojiu would sign a separation agreement, severing their relationship. Zhuang would give Laojiu 4,000 gold coins, and Laojiu would leave and remarry, returning to her old profession. Zhang feared that her husband would not forget his love, so she accompanied him to Zhenjiang to avoid gossip. Unexpectedly, a month later, Zhuang happened to meet Laojiu at a theater. They were particularly intimate after a long separation, and Zhuang's previous agreement was actually forced by his wife's authority and not his true intention. Now, they met again and wanted to rekindle their romance. Laojiu seized the opportunity and said, "Although I am separated from you, the child in my belly is yours. Even if you don't remember our love, can you forget this?" Zhuang was bewildered. Therefore, he reignited the ashes of their love and ordered Laojiu to close her business again, starting their second cohabitation. Zhang Yuexing's husband was once again taken away, but she did not know it at first. On the 18th of last month, Zhang returned to her hometown of Ningbo for a family celebration. Zhuang seized the opportunity to move all of his belongings and bedding to 27 Duofuli, Fuxu Road, intending to live with Minghua Laojiu forever and abandon his legal wife. Later, Zhang learned of this in her hometown and rushed back to Shanghai, finding out where they were hiding and reporting them to the Chengdu Road police station. At 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, detectives Wang Yongjun rushed to arrest them. Zhuang and Laojiu were still sound asleep together when they were awakened and arrested. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Dai Rongduo conducted the interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xun Jiu explained the case, stating that the two defendants had committed a crime under Article 239 of the Criminal Law and requesting that they be punished according to the law. Then, Zhuang Zhang Yuexing recounted the details of her husband's adultery with Minghua Laojiu and also requested that the two defendants be punished according to the law. When questioned, Zhuang Jimeng confessed that he had taken the prostitute as a concubine because his legal wife treated him coldly. Minghua Laojiu confessed that she did not know that Zhuang had a wife. After the defendant's lawyer's defense, the court ordered Zhuang Jimeng and Feng Minghua to each provide a 300 yuan bond and await sentencing next Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage and a native of Yancheng, was implicated in the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng and was arrested by the legal police based on the accusation of the arrested criminal Zhao Guangfu. He was prosecuted and tried by the Second Special Court and sentenced to 15 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights.

The court had already held a hearing on the 27th of last month and adjourned the hearing to a later date for a more detailed investigation of the case. The defense lawyer, Shan Yuhua, requested the Third Branch of the Higher Court to review the case files in detail, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that Judge Yue, who is handling this case in the Third Branch of the Higher Court, is conducting a thorough investigation. Yesterday morning, Chen Rong, a tea room waiter from the Asian Hotel at 135 Edward Road, was summoned to court at around 10 o'clock. Judge Wang opened the court and questioned him. According to Chen, he has been a tea room waiter for ship brokers at the Asian Hotel for a long time. He said that the important account books, such as the circulation books from June 22, were taken back to Guangdong by the former supervisor. When asked if he could retrieve these account books, he replied that he would try to find a way. As a result, the court ordered Chen to retrieve these account books as soon as possible and submit them to the court for verification, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Secret Den Uncovered on Beidi'e Road in the French Concession; Drugs and Equipment Complete; Some Admit to Small-Scale Production, Others Deny All Responsibility</h3>
<p>Guo Rusheng, a native of Changshu, 32 years old, originally a tailor residing at No. 44 Beidi'e Road in the French Concession, recently abandoned his old profession and secretly produced red pills for sale in the city at the home of his fellow townsman Zhao Ada (41 years old) in Qingchengfang, Guojielou, No. 85 on the same road. This was discovered by French police detectives Zhang Ziying and Qin Youyu, who led detectives Wang Dongwan, Ma Yizhi, and Tao Ronglin to the address at noon on the 13th to arrest Guo Rusheng. A porcelain bowl containing red chemical compounds ready to be made into red pills, 8 pounds of sugar powder, a package of morphine (worth about 10 yuan), and 6 small packages of quinine powder were seized in his residence. Two small packages of opium were also found in his pocket. They then took Guo to Zhao Ada's house on the upper floor of Qingchengfang, Guojielou. Zhao was setting up a baked sweet potato stall at the intersection of Beidi'e Road and Pushi Road, and no one was home. Detective Ma Yizhi first went to Zhao's sweet potato stall, pretending to buy sweet potatoes and secretly monitoring his movements. Meanwhile, detectives Zhang and Qin and detectives Wang and Tao searched Zhao's home, seizing 14,500 red pills, a pill-making board, a pill-making mold, a sieve, a baking basket, a stove, a lead bucket, and miscellaneous equipment. They then searched the room of Gu Xiaoru (27 years old, a vegetable vendor from Changshu), a lodger on the third floor of Qingchengfang, Guojielou, seizing 10,000 red pills and a rattan basket. While the search was underway, Han Yucai (30 years old, a barber from Yangzhou), who lived in the same building, learned about it and rushed to the sweet potato stall at the intersection of Pushi Road to inform Zhao Ada, the landlord. Detective Ma Yizhi, who was monitoring him, arrested Zhao and Han, along with Guo and Gu, and took them and the seized evidence back to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan explained the case, stating that the police needed to investigate the case and requested a one-week extension before requesting a trial. Detective Qin Youyu then reported the arrest of the defendants and the search process and presented the seized red pills and other items to the court. When questioned, Guo Rusheng confessed that he made the red pills alone and that Xiaojiangbei had asked him to do it. He borrowed Zhao Ada's house to make them and paid 2 yuan a month in rent. He had been making them for nearly two months, with a capital of 50 yuan. After they were made, Xiaojiangbei took them to sell, selling a total of 15 packages. He had previously worked for Yang Aizi and a Mr. Wang's red pill company as a tea room waiter, learning how to make them. Later, Yang Gan and others stopped making them because of the increased scrutiny, and he obtained the red pill-making equipment. Recently, Xiaojiangbei asked him to make them because he had nothing to do. He rented Zhao's house on September 21 and started making them on the 22nd. Zhao Ada confessed that he was not a shareholder and that Guo borrowed his place to make red pills, for which he received 4 yuan in rent. Gu Xiaoru confessed that he usually sold vegetables and did not make red pills. He said that Guo put the red pills in his room. Han Yucai confessed that he lived on the third floor of No. 85 Guojie and was a barber at a barber shop at No. 87 next door. Yesterday, because the stove in the shop was being repaired, he was looking for screws at home and saw the search at Zhao's house. Because there was no one at Zhao's house, he went to inform Zhao Ada. He said that he did not know about the red pill making and did not intentionally tip him off. Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed the confessions and ordered the case to be adjourned to the 21st for further questioning. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>British Police Court Questions Two British Police Officers in Drowning Case</h3>
<p>According to the Damei Evening News, British police officer Peters and probationary police officer Gutte, from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, were accused of throwing beggar Mao Debiao into the Hongkou River on December 1, causing bodily harm and resulting in his death. This morning (the 14th), the British Consulate Police Court reopened the case for trial. According to witness Sun, a vendor, he left home at around 3:00 AM on December 1 to go to the vegetable market to buy vegetables when he saw a car parked on the road along the Hongkou River. He then saw two foreigners standing by the river, shining a light. Soon after, they got into the car and drove away. He saw that the car number was 8501. He then approached the river to see what they were shining the light on and saw a person's head protruding from the water. He immediately shouted for help and asked a nearby boatman to use a bamboo pole to rescue the person. Since the two of them could not lift the person, they asked a neighbor for help. At that time, a Chinese police officer happened to walk by, number 903, and they handed the person they had rescued to the officer and placed him on the shore. The officer then made a phone call to request an ambulance. He told the officer the car number he had seen, his name, address, and the situation he had seen before the ambulance arrived. They then carried the dying person onto the ambulance, and the officer followed the car. He later went to the Tongren Hospital with several foreign patrol officers and detectives on December 3 to see the person they had rescued. Sun and the previous witness, the driver, both stated that the tide was high at the time. Although the driver did not see the water, he stated that he heard a splash when Peters and Gutte threw the beggar into the river that day. After the testimony was completed, the judge adjourned the court and scheduled the trial to continue on December 19.</p>

<p>Japanese Takahashi Seiji and Korean Wei Huilin rented a house at No. 8, Lane 167, Xiaoshapo Road, West Shanghai, and established a manufacturing agency for highly addictive drugs such as heroin and morphine. Ningbo native Gao Jinglan and Shandong native Jiang Yingsan cooperated with them, and all manufacturing, transportation, and sales were extremely secretive. Recently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station began to hear rumors about it and immediately investigated. On the day before yesterday, they applied to the First Special District Local Court for a search warrant and rushed to the location, seizing manufactured heroin, raw material drug powder and liquid, and manufacturing equipment. They quickly took the four Chinese and Japanese people back to the police station. After being interrogated by the police chief, Takahashi Seiji and Wei Huilin were handed over to the Japanese Consulate for investigation, while Gao Jinglan and Jiang Yingsan were escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Jiang Shuzi conducted the interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the details of the case after it was solved, presented the seized drugs, and requested that they be punished according to the law. When questioned, the defendant Gao Jinglan confessed that the agency was jointly established by Japanese and Korean Takahashi and Zhang Huilin and that he was hired. Jiang Yingsan also confessed that he was hired by Takahashi to be the chief steward and that he did not know anything about the drug-making behavior. Judge Jiang then ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial to next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Fire at Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Many Deaths and Injuries; Printing Room Burned, Loss Not Too Great; Fire Truck Kills Two, Injures Three</h3>
<p>The Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory Third Factory, located at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Liaoyang Road, had a fire at around 2:30 PM yesterday. Sparks were caused by prolonged friction on the printing machine wheel in the printing room, igniting the printed cloth. A dense smoke spread, threatening to engulf the factory. The workers in the room, seeing that things were not going well, immediately sounded the whistle to warn others. The workers in the factory and the workers in the neighboring Second Factory gathered upon hearing the news, carrying the fire-fighting equipment prepared by the factory and making efforts to put out the fire. At the same time, the Fire Brigade also received the report and rushed to the scene with fire trucks to put out the fire. When they arrived at the factory, the fire had already been extinguished, so it did not become a major disaster. When the fire trucks were rushing to the scene near Dalianwan Road, the workers and residents there gathered in the middle of the road and did not have time to get out of the way, causing four men to be hit by the fire trucks. One of them died on the spot, with blood flowing all over the ground. The name and surname are unknown. Three other men were also injured. One of them, Cao Yinshi, 23 years old, from Tongzhou, a worker at the Zhonghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, had his right leg bone crushed and died of his injuries after being sent to the hospital. One of them, Wang Enrong, 26 years old, from Gaoniu, and one of them, Zhang Ziqiang, 17 years old, from Chongming, an apprentice at a nearby pastry shop, had their back bones and legs injured and are currently being treated. One of the factory staff, Wang Mengzhong, broke his hand bone after jumping from the printing room upstairs when the fire broke out and has been sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Xiangguang Lane, Dongxi Huade Road: Court Orders 20% Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Xiangguang Lane, Dongxi Huade Road, has more than 50 houses in total, which are the property of Xiangmao foreign company. Tenants Shi Jichao and others requested the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee to negotiate a rent reduction because the rent was too expensive and they could not afford it.

<h3>A Couple, One Arrested, One Escaped</h3>
<p>Chen Fuliang, a 38-year-old Shanghai resident who runs a truck business, residing at No. 5 Rendeli, Hope Road, previously took Pan Lanying, a 22-year-old from Yuhang, as a concubine. She used to work as a No. 3 female tea server at Wing On Company. Dissatisfied with her confined life, she became acquainted with Wang Wenrong, a loafer, and absconded with over 4,000 yuan worth of gold jewelry, leaving no trace. Chen reported the incident to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. Recently, Pan Lanying was found repairing a clock at Ronghua Xiang Clock Shop on Fourth Road. Chen apprehended her and handed her over to the police station. Subsequently, Xin Jingsheng, the deputy squad leader of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau's detective team, along with squad leaders Liu Bingyuan and Liu Shaoqing, went to the police station to take the woman back. After interrogating her, they learned that she resided in a three-story pavilion room at No. 12 Dexingli, West Xinqiao Street, in the French Concession. They immediately took the original plaintiff and, together with West Detective No. 23 from the French police and Chinese Detective Xue Youlin, searched the address. They found keys and hairpins, among other original stolen goods, in the room. The other gold jewelry had already been taken away. They also questioned the second landlord, a woman surnamed Zhu, who stated that the house was indeed rented and cohabited by Wang Wenrong and Pan Lanying. Pan Lanying was taken back to the branch bureau, and a document was prepared to be submitted to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>International Art Theatre to Regularly Perform Ancient Greek Plays</h3>
<p>The International Art Theatre's production of the Greek comedy "Lysistrata" is scheduled to premiere at the Grand Theatre on the evenings of the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month at 9:15 PM. The play was originally written by Aristophanes, the only comedic playwright in Greece 2,200 years ago. For two millennia, theaters around the world have competed to stage it, making it one of the most famous comedies in the world. The characters in the play are vivid, and their portrayal of the relationship between men and women, with all its joys, laughter, anger, and scolding, is particularly colorful. The Athenian people's love for the bold and poignant depiction of life from 2,000 years ago can be seen in this play. Although this play is popular everywhere, some conservatives still criticize it for having flaws in its moral concepts. In fact, the characters in the play, although from thousands of years ago, are just like the young women of today in their words, deeds, thoughts, and behaviors. Therefore, the audience can make their own judgment about its value. The play features 60 actors, with Ms. Emily Hahn playing the lead role. Seats can be booked in advance at the Moutrie Company on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Disappeared Shortly After Marriage</h3>
<p>Song Wenhuan, from Hebei, joined the military at a young age and is now a sergeant in the Garrison Command. Approaching his forties, he had never married. Song usually saved his money and accumulated over a hundred yuan. Last month, through matchmakers such as Du Guangzhi, he married Xiao Erzi, the younger sister of Ruan Li, a Jiangbei native residing at the Longhua Dog Breeding Center, as his wife. However, less than a month after the marriage, Xiao Erzi disappeared without a trace. Despite asking people to search in all directions, she was never found. Song, having lost his life's savings, was filled with resentment and handed Ruan Li over to the police station in charge, requesting an investigation. Director Wu interrogated Ruan Li, who stated that her sister, Xiao Erzi, and Song Wenhuan had been cohabiting before the marriage. She claimed that she was unaware of the escape. Director Wu, considering that the case involved accusations and control, ordered both parties to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Caohojing Township, Political Agency: Shop Assistant Detained for Stealing Stamps</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuxing Rice Shop in Caohojing Township, West Shanghai, also serves as a postal agency. Zhang Rongjiang, the shopkeeper, secretly tore off stamps from letters and sold them. Recently, the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau learned of this and secretly sent an internal inspector, Fang Guorong, to investigate. It was estimated that stamps had been torn from envelopes (each worth five cents), totaling six jiao. Fang, with conclusive evidence, reported the case to the town's Public Security Bureau, which detained Zhang Rongjiang and brought him in for questioning. Zhang confessed to secretly tearing and selling the stamps. A document has been prepared to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. Aid, the rickshaw pullers work from door to door every day, braving the wind, rain, cold and snow.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Adultery Case between a Rickshaw Puller and a Young Mistress: The Judge Sternly Interrogates and Advises for Out-of-Court Settlement; The Parties' Dishonesty Inconveniences the Witness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trial took place. Liu Zirong, the third son of Liu Huizhi, the former general manager of the China Industrial Bank, married Liu Xi (also known as Xi Yunxiao, or Yunqing), the daughter of Xi Xunxian, a wealthy dye merchant from Jiangyin, in the 20th year of the Republic of China. They lived together in the Xizhong New Village on Dilun Road, Yuyuan Road. The couple's relationship was quite good. However, Zirong enjoyed indulging in pleasure and was rarely at home. Xi Yunqing felt lonely in her boudoir and was seduced into adultery by Wu Wenxiang, a rickshaw puller. They planned to become a permanent couple and, in the autumn of this year, they eloped together, taking everything with them, and hid in a pavilion room at No. 84 Jixiangfang, Qianjiatang, French Concession. They lived together like a married couple. Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered. Recently, Liu Zirong found out their hiding place and reported it to the police. Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang were arrested together and sent to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the local court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu conducted the investigation and ordered them to be detained separately. This was reported in the previous newspapers. Now, it is known that Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu has completed the trial and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court, scheduling a public trial for 2 PM on the 14th. The facts of the crime, the relevant legal provisions, and the details of the interrogation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime: It is generally stated that the defendants' adultery has been admitted by them in the Public Security Bureau. It is also clear from Liu Zirong's testimony that defendant Liu Xi took away 5,000 yuan entrusted to her by Liu Zirong for safekeeping. Based on their actions, Liu Xi committed the offense specified in the first paragraph of Article 239 and Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and Wu Wenxiang committed the offense specified in the second paragraph of Article 239 of the same code. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Yesterday, on the scheduled trial date, the gallery in the Third Tribunal was packed at 2 PM. Those who arrived later could not find a place to stand. Most of them were relatives and friends of the plaintiff and defendants. Judicial Constable Zhang Shuping supervised four bailiffs to maintain order around the courtroom. Plaintiff Liu Zirong hired lawyer Shan Yuhua to appear in court and requested a private claim of 5,000 yuan in national currency. Defendants Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang also hired lawyers Chao Kun and Gao Junxiang to appear in court to defend them.</p>
<p>The Judge Opens the Court: At 2:30 PM, Judge Shao Qinzhi took the bench and ordered Wu Wenxiang and Liu Xi, who were in custody, to be brought to the case. (Wu Wenxiang wore a gray Zhongshan cloth jacket and flower velvet shoes; Liu Xi wore a light gray woolen overcoat, a coffee-colored floral satin cheongsam, and flower velvet shoes.) First, their ages, native places, and addresses were asked. Wu Wenxiang stated that he was 22 years old, from Chuansha, and resided at No. 44 Kangleli, Fuxu Road. Liu Xi stated that she was 25 years old, from Jiangyin, and resided at No. 84 Jixiangfang, Qianjiatang. To be cautious, the judge ordered Liu Xi to be taken down and questioned separately.</p>
<p>Wu Wenxiang's Testimony: Judge: Wu Wenxiang, when did you start working as a rickshaw puller at Liu Zirong's house? Wu: In the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Judge: When did you quit? Wu: In June of this year. Judge: How much was your monthly salary? Wu: Twenty-seven yuan. Judge: How did the young master and mistress treat you? Wu: They were good to me. Judge: Whose car did you drive? Wu: I drove the car specifically for the young master. Judge: The young master treated you very well. Why did you quit? Wu: Because I had a fever, so I quit. Judge: Did you borrow money from the young mistress? Wu: I borrowed money because I was sick. Judge: When did the young mistress leave? Wu: I don't know. Judge: Have you sworn brotherhood with anyone? Wu: Yes, I have. Judge: Who is the eldest brother? Wu: His name is Du Jiazhen. Judge: Do you know Xiuying? Wu: I don't know her. Judge: Do you have a diary? Wu: No, I don't. Judge: Did you have an affair with the young mistress? Wu: No, I didn't. Judge: Then why were you arrested? Wu: Because I couldn't work due to illness, I planned to return to my hometown, but I didn't have enough travel expenses, so I borrowed money from the young mistress. I was arrested as soon as I arrived at the young mistress's place. Judge: You admitted it unequivocally in the Public Security Bureau. Are you still trying to deny it today? Wu: I confessed indiscriminately because I was tortured. Judge: According to you, you borrowed money from the young mistress. If the young mistress refused to lend you money, what would you have done? Wu: I would have to find a way to ask friends for help. Judge: What are you going to do in your hometown? Wu: Recover from my illness. Judge: Why didn't you bring your bedding and luggage to your hometown? Wu: I have relatives in my hometown, and it is inconvenient to carry them while traveling. Judge: Why is your photo in the young mistress's place? Wu: I had it with me when I went to borrow money. Judge: Where was your photo taken? Wu: It was taken when I was working at the Liu family. Judge: Have you ever been to Hangzhou? Wu: The young master took me there. Judge: Did your sworn brother and Chen Dejun also borrow money from the young mistress? Wu: I don't know. Judge: Whose horoscope is this? Wu: I don't have one. Judge: If the young mistress didn't have an affair with you, why would she go live in a pavilion room alone? Wu: I don't know. The judge ordered him to step down and brought Liu Xi to the case.</p>
<p>Questioning Liu Xi: The judge said: "Now, this court will inform you first. You should tell the truth in court today. It is useless for you to try to deny it. If you have suffered all kinds of persecution in your family, which is why you ended up on this path, the general public can understand you. How many years have you been married to Liu Zirong?" Liu: "Four years." Judge: "Was the relationship good?" Liu: "It was good at first, but after I gave birth, he changed and became unhappy. The child is now three years old. I can't leave the child. He likes to dance and go to brothels. Can you dance?" Liu: "Yes, I can. He doesn't take me. My money has been used up by him." Judge: "Is Wu Wenxiang a rickshaw puller?" Liu: "Yes, he is. When did your relationship with him begin?" Liu: "It didn't." Judge: "You don't need to deny it. I couldn't stand it at home, so I left. As for the rickshaw puller, because he was going to the countryside, he borrowed money from me." Judge: "You don't want to live in your husband's house, nor do you live in your mother's house. Besides, your family is well-off. You are making trouble for yourself and being despised." Liu: "If I go home, wouldn't it implicate my mother's family?" The judge said, "If you really go home, what harm is there?" Judge: "When did you leave?" Liu: "On the fourth day of the seventh month." Judge: "Did you quarrel with your husband?" Liu: "We often quarrel." Judge: "Do you know Fei Shunde?" Liu: "Yes, I do. He is a friend of the rickshaw puller and came to borrow money." Judge: "You live in Jixiangfang. How many times did he come to borrow money?" Liu: "Three times." Judge: "Did the rickshaw puller's eldest brother (the one he swore brotherhood with) borrow money from you?" Liu: "He borrowed a hundred yuan." Judge: "Why do they know your address?" Liu: "I went to the company to shop and met them." Judge: "Who is A-San?" Liu: "The rickshaw puller's brother." Judge: "Does the rickshaw puller Wu Wenxiang have another name?" Liu: "Yes, his nickname is A-Jin." Judge: "Who is Xiuying?" Liu: "The rickshaw puller's little girl from the countryside." Judge: "Is this diary found yours?" Liu: "Yes, it is." Judge: "Why did you give A-San seventy-five yuan the first day you went to live in Jixiangfang?" Liu: "A-San borrowed it from me." The judge said, "You are a young mistress. How do you associate with rickshaw pullers? It is obvious that you are on good terms with Wu Wenxiang." Judge: "The little girl came to your place on the ninth day of the eighth month. You gave her four yuan as a gift. If you say Wu Wenxiang doesn't know where you live, why do they all come to your place?" Liu Xi was speechless. Judge: "Who is the little girl?" Liu: "She is the daughter of the rickshaw puller's brother." The judge took out more than ten photos and asked Liu Xi to identify them. She answered them one by one and said that the rickshaw puller brought them. The judge said, "You still don't tell the truth. If you don't have a close relationship with the rickshaw puller, how do you know so much in detail? You should tell the truth. If he seduced you, then you are the victim, and he will be the one to bear the crime. Or, if your husband is not on good terms with you, so you left out of anger, then the law can also forgive your crime. You don't tell the truth, and it's not allowed. You are having an affair, and the truth is not clear. You are a young mistress having an affair with a rickshaw puller. The newspapers are publishing it with large headlines, and theaters are staging new plays about it. Now you have a chance to state the facts clearly, and this court will judge the case based on the circumstances. Otherwise, if you continue to be confused, the truth will never be known. You have to think clearly." Liu Xi still argued.</p>
<p>Liu Zirong's Testimony: The judge ordered Liu Zirong to the case. He testified that he was 26 years old, from Anhui, and worked in a bank. His relationship with Xi was quite good. On August 2 of this year, she disappeared without a trace. Judge: "After Xi left, did you receive a letter?" Liu: "Yes, I did." Judge: "How did you know where Xi was hiding?" Liu: "Someone told me, so I went to arrest them on November 26 at seven or eight in the morning. They were still sleeping in bed. Did you accuse her of adultery and elopement?" Liu: "Yes, I did. I also want to recover 5,000 yuan." Judge: "Have you already filed for divorce?" Liu: "Yes, I have filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court." Judge: "If you both agree to a divorce, will you still prosecute them?" Liu: "Yes, I will." The judge said, "This case involves morals. I hope you can settle it out of court. Next time, you must bring Xi's letter to the court." Liu obeyed.</p>
<p>Witnesses Released on Bail: Finally, Zhou A-Mei, the wife of the second landlord Zhou Donglin, testified. She was seventeen years old and lived at No. 84 Jixiangfang. The building has three floors and houses seven families. Liu Xi moved in in early July and lived in the pavilion room. The monthly rent was six and a half yuan. Xi rented it alone. There were few furnishings, only a bed, two boxes, a table, several stools, and bedding. There were no men there. The judge said, "You are the second landlord. Their affairs have nothing to do with you. You should tell the truth. If you tell lies, you will be committing a crime." He ordered her to provide a testimony. Judge: "Did Liu Xi go out often?" Zhou: "No, she didn't." Judge: "If she didn't go out, how did she pass the time?" Zhou: "She did knitting." Judge: "Have you seen this rickshaw puller?" Zhou: "He came in through the back door that day. I opened the door. He was arrested shortly after." The judge questioned her in detail and told her that witnesses must tell the truth. Zhou A-Mei did not know the seriousness of the matter and sided with them. The judge, considering that Zhou A-Mei had deceived the court, ordered her to be released on bail. Wu Wenxiang and Liu Xi were returned to custody, and Liu Zirong was told to leave. The trial will continue later. By the time the court adjourned, it was already dusk.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers in the Public Concession Petition the Mutual Aid Society to Provide Relief for Stolen Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the French Concession Police Department have repeatedly arrested the masterminds and accomplices in the city's rickshaw theft and extortion cases and transferred them to the courts or work-study centers for vagrants. However, the remaining gang members are still scattered throughout the concession and the northern and southern parts of the city. Once a rickshaw puller's rickshaw falls into their clutches, the ransom is doubled or tripled compared to before. Honest rickshaw owners who find out about these channels or know someone are often prepared to pay the ransom but have no way to retrieve the rickshaw. The suffering of rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession is particularly severe. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society has been established for more than a year, and the mutual aid fees collected from the rickshaw pullers have reached more than 200,000 yuan. However, the problem of rickshaw theft, which is a painful and urgent problem for the rickshaw pullers and unavoidable in their business, has not yet been addressed. Recently, rickshaw pullers Zheng Deren, Liang Yugong, Yang Changsheng, Huang Delian, Xia Huaicheng, Huang Atang, Xu Zhubin, Xiao Guofu, Chen Zhizhong, Wu Youlin, Jiang Fuchang, Zheng Jinqing, Zhao Shujin, etc., who pull rickshaws in the Public Concession, specifically requested the Mutual Aid Society to plan relief measures. The original text is as follows: "Petition for Promptly Establishing Relief Measures for Stolen Rickshaws to Show Compassion. Since the establishment of your society, you have spent a considerable amount on rickshaw pullers' relief efforts, such as providing medical treatment, medicine, clothing, and rice. However, when rickshaw pullers are working and are deceived by thieves, their rickshaws are suddenly lost. The situation at that time can be described as extremely miserable. Rickshaw owners, under the accumulation of power, dare not deal with these thieves. Moreover, if they stop working for a day, they will lose a day's income. They all follow the practice of contacting these people to pay the ransom, ranging from more than 20 yuan to as much as 160 yuan, to continue working. Rickshaw pullers usually eat today and worry about tomorrow. If they don't work, they don't eat. They must borrow money and pay high interest rates to take care of their immediate needs. We believe that your society is aware of their situation. For many years, no relief measures have been planned. The rickshaw pullers are deeply concerned and cannot remain silent after witnessing it firsthand. Therefore, we submit this document, hoping that your esteemed society will establish prompt relief measures with the spirit of saving people and saving them thoroughly, so that rickshaw pullers can escape from this sea of suffering in the short term and no longer suffer such unexpected losses. The rickshaw pullers will be very grateful, and society will be very fortunate. We humbly await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society."</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Night Soil Carters' Association Resolves to Collect One Copper Coin Per Bucket Per Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Night Soil Carters' Association convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. Fifty-two people, including Liu Changbai, Zhao Wenfu, Geng Zhen, Zhu Shengyao, Shen Wensheng, Tang Ling, Cai Kesheng, and Lu Yuqiao, attended. Chen Jintang was elected chairman, and Gu Jinyi was the recorder. After the rituals, the chairman reported that due to the recent bankruptcy of rural areas and the stagnation of night soil fertilizer, the members were facing difficulties in their lives. However, they had to pay fees for licenses and repairs, which were very high. Since the government did not have sufficient funds, it was difficult to maintain their livelihoods. It was unfair to fulfill unlimited obligations to the residents. After discussions, it was resolved to cancel all the old regulations and fees and instead collect one copper coin per bucket per day from the bucket owners, for a monthly wage of thirty copper coins, to cover expenses such as license fees and vehicle repair wages. The rickshaw puller Liu Luoshi was beaten by resident Wu A-Er for collecting liquor money. The lawyer Zhu Honglie, representing the association, has filed a lawsuit with the local court. Wu A-Er was sentenced to a fine of five yuan and medical expenses of fifteen yuan. The execution period has expired long ago, but the court has not yet arrested him. It was resolved to continue to request the arrest and handling of the case. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Junior Cup Matches: All Three Chinese Teams Win</h3>
<p>Youyou Defeats Jewish Team, Tung Wah Defeats Western Merchants, Qinghua Loses to PB</p>
<p>In yesterday's Western Union Football Junior Cup matches, the Chinese teams playing were Youyou vs. Jewish Team, Tung Wah vs. Western Merchants, and Qinghua vs. PB. All three Chinese teams emerged victorious. Qinghua defeated PB with a score of ten to one. The details of the Youyou vs. Jewish Team and Tung Wah vs. Western Merchants matches are described below.</p>
<h3>Youyou Defeats Jewish Team Eight to One</h3>
<p>Youyou played against the Jewish team at 3 PM yesterday at Jiaozhou Park on Jiaozhou Road. Relying on their complete lineup and skillful coordination, Youyou took the lead in the first half with a score of one to zero. In the second half, they changed their strategy and had a smooth ride, leaving the Jewish team exhausted. Youyou won a major victory with a score of seven to one. Overall, Youyou triumphed with a score of eight to one.</p>
<p>Youyou Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Youyou launched an offensive first. Xu Wenkui advanced the ball, and Zhong Yongsheng started a revolt on the periphery, dribbling the ball bravely forward and shooting powerfully at the goal. Unfortunately, the goalkeeper blocked it. Little Zhong was not discouraged and continued to do his own thing, partnering with Little Mengchang to advance together. However, their aim was not accurate enough and they did not score. After that, the ball was often in front of the Jewish team's goal, stirring up trouble. Fortunately, the goalkeeper, Huarfen, performed brilliantly, saving many dangerous shots. Qiaosheng, who had been quiet for a long time, assisted by Little Zhong, acted decisively, attacking the enemy camp and kicking the ball, hitting Fenna's back and bouncing into the net. This goal can truly be called ingenious. The score was opened. Afterwards, Youyou repeatedly pressed into the enemy's territory. Qiaosheng shot from afar and scored, but it was disallowed due to offside. In the first half, Youyou took the lead with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>Major Defeat for Jewish Team</p>
<p>Switching sides for the second half, the Jewish team had a do-or-die determination and a great momentum. The army used their lives and their momentum was like wind sweeping away leaves. They were stirring up trouble in Youyou's territory, but it was a fleeting moment. Youyou was like the Yangtze River pouring down, rushing straight into the enemy's territory. Zhong Yongsheng got the chance to take a corner kick, and Qiaosheng reaped the benefits. Then, Qiaosheng, assisted by Xu Wenkui, shot from afar and scored. The Jewish team repeatedly lost ground, and could not help but be furious, raising their arms and advancing together. Wang Zhangbao saw the situation was not good and hurried to block the ball, inadvertently committing a foul. D. Galingbo took the penalty and the landing point was excellent. Gehanman rushed up and knocked on the door. Zhang Rongcai was flustered and could not save it in time, watching the ball roll into the corner of the net. The Jewish team avoided the shame of being blanked with a score of three to one. Little Chui gave a signal and secretly passed the ball to Qiaosheng, who had a plan in mind. He dribbled the ball into the enemy's camp and lived up to expectations. Little Mengchang saw that his own team had won a great victory and felt relaxed, secretly sending A Dou to Little Chui, adding two more goals. At this time, the Jewish team had lost the overall situation and knew it was difficult to turn the tide. A thousand Youyou invaded and Qiaosheng scored again. Jiang Shanqing was envious and ran out of the center back line, broke through three barriers, and broke the enemy's goal, which was truly unique. Xu Wenkui also returned with merit. In total, Youyou defeated the Jewish team with a score of eight to one. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Jiang Shanqing, Zhu Qiu, Wang Zhangbao, Chen Zhenxiang, Shen Baigui, Shen Shiqi, Cheng Yize, Xu Wenkui, Xi Qiaosheng, Zhong Yongsheng</p>
<p>Jewish Team</p>
<p>Huarfen, Fenna, R. Ge Ke, H. Ge Ke, Ke Han, Xu Shi, W. Ge Ke, Pi Lifushi, Ge Hanman, D. Galingbo, Q. Galingbo</p>
<h3>Tung Wah Defeats Western Merchants Two to One</h3>
<p>Tung Wah B played Western Merchants in the Junior Cup at Shen Garden. The battle was very intense. Although Tung Wah was as fierce as a thunderbolt, Western Merchants' strength was also considerable, and they could not be completely controlled. Fortunately, Tung Wah made a final effort to defeat Western Merchants with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>Neither Side Gains Anything</p>
<p>The battle began at exactly three o'clock. Tung Wah's five forwards advanced together with great momentum, passing through three barriers in a row. Shao Jihua received Zhang Jinhai's support and kicked the ball, but it bounced back from the post. Western Merchants then began to counterattack. Chen Xianglong failed to intercept, and Yin Zhengda blocked the way. The disturbance ended there. Although Western Merchants had the advantage of the wind, they frequently missed good opportunities due to inaccurate shooting. Several attacks all failed. Tung Wah waited due to the headwind, and it was difficult to advance, coupled with the Western Merchants' desperate resistance, they achieved nothing. Back and forth, neither side gained anything. The first half ended with a score of zero to zero.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Wins</p>
<p>After switching sides, Tung Wah had the advantage of the wind, and the forwards became more active. Xue Wenxiu started a revolt on the periphery, attacking straight forward and passing to the center line. Zhang Jinhai received the ball, dribbled past the enemy troops, and shot accurately from the ten-yard line. The ball went in from an oblique angle, clear and beautiful, and the score was opened. After the center line kickoff, Western Merchants struggled forward. Chen Gongyu did not send it far, and Western Merchants came back again, but were hindered by the headwind, which was always unfavorable. However, Tung Wah was full of energy, Huang Ruihua passed remotely to Binghao, who then passed to Jihua. After several passes, the ball was at Chen Yutian's feet. Yutian was quick-eyed and quick-footed, and kicked the ball in. Tung Wah took the lead with a score of two to zero. Western Merchants faced this crisis and did their best to cope, and it worked as they managed to score a goal only two seconds before the end. Two to one, Tung Wah won.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Football Championship: Jinan Defeats Fudan</h3>
<p>The result was a ratio of one to zero. Cai Jincai determined the outcome with one kick.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association Football Championship, Jinan versus Fudan, was held at the Fudan stadium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. The strength of the two sides was only slightly different, and the battle was tense throughout. In the first half, Jinan got a corner kick opportunity, and Cai Jincai kicked in a goal. In the other half, the two sides defended tightly and neither side gained anything. However, due to their eagerness to win, their hands and feet were inevitably rough, causing a small dispute, but it was soon calmed down. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan Opens the Record</p>
<p>It started at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, referee Chen Jixiang, linesmen He Chunhui and Shen Huichun. After the start of the battle, Fudan took advantage of the local conditions, and the five forwards rushed in. About twelve yards away, Gong Ziwen turned around and kicked, but it was too high. Jinan Chui Yuxiang refused to be weak, dribbled past the center line and passed to left winger Wang Nanzhen, who dribbled the ball forward and was blocked by Guan Xun'an, forcing a corner kick. Wang took the kick, and the landing point was very good, but Fudan's Zhang Rong headed it out. At this time, Fudan's Weng Ren'an intercepted the ball, rotated it three or five times, and passed it to right winger Liu Chengshu. Liu ran with joy, dribbled to the baseline, and passed it into the center. Fang Baolin came head-on and kicked it into the net, but it was disallowed due to offside. After that, they went back and forth and achieved nothing. Until the last few minutes, Jinan's Wang Nanzhen took the corner kick, landing two or three yards in front of Fudan's goal. Cai Jincai rushed out, and with a horizontal sweep, the ball entered the net. At the end of the first half, Jinan won with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>Fudan Misses Many Opportunities</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Fudan's forwards made some adjustments. Center forward Gong Ziwen led the three armies and launched a large-scale counterattack, with center defender Weng Ren'an coordinating in the center, and Yu Zefan and Zhong Qixiong delivering on the left and right, and the momentum increased sharply. However, the forwards lacked shooting talent, resulting in many missed opportunities. Afterwards, left inside forward Cheng Shichang was injured and left the field, replaced by Wo Jinwen, and the situation immediately plummeted. At this time, Jinan's five forwards were unusually active, and repeatedly attacked Fudan's goal, but Guan Xun'an and Zhang Rong calmly responded, and goalkeeper Zhou Dayun was steady and experienced, saving many dangerous shots. Until the end, neither side gained anything. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jinan University</p>
<p>Ye Peichu, Chen Chunshou, Wen Naibin, Yun Feng, Liang Shutang, Wu Shufen, Wang Nanzhen, Cai Jincai, Zhong Yuxiang, Xue Quanyuan, Qiu Zhen'an</p>
<p>Fudan University</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun, Zhang Rong, Guan Xun'an, Yu Zefan, Weng Ren'an, Zhong Qixiong, Cheng Shichang, Fang Baolin, Chen Shixi (out), Gong Ziwen, Li Changchi, Liu Chengshu (in)</p>
<h3>Western Youth Basketball Last Night: Nansing Loses to Hujiang</h3>
<p>—Thirty-three to Thirty—</p>
<p>In Western Youth Basketball, only one Group A match was played last night, Nansing versus Hujiang. As a result, Hujiang defeated Nansing by three points, with a score of thirty-three to thirty. Hujiang was in the lead all the way, and Nansing's late surge was too late. The competition was still fierce. The results of the four matches are as follows:</p>
<p>(B) Western Youth defeats Tongwen, 22 to 15 (first half 16 to 6)</p>
<p>(B) Guoguang defeats Moore, 26 to 2 (first half 15 to 12)</p>
<p>(B) Mailing defeats Tax Academy, 44 to 29 (first half 21 to 14)</p>
<p>(A) Hujiang defeats Nansing, 33 to 30 (first half 21 to 17)</p>
<p>Mailing Defeats Tax Academy</p>
<p>The match between Mailing B and Tax Academy in Group B was the most intense. Although Tax Academy lost, the battle was extremely exciting. Mailing B relied on its tall stature to dominate for a while. Tax Academy tried everything to cope, but was always five or six points behind. In the last few minutes, they were exhausted and collapsed, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Hujiang Defeats Nansing</p>
<p>The two sides were evenly matched, and neither side performed well. In the first half, Hujiang scored three consecutive baskets, and then Nansing took the lead with a score of eight to six. Hujiang counterattacked and took the lead again, and from then on took the lead. In the first half, Hujiang took the lead with a score of twenty-one to seventeen. In the second half, Nansing adjusted its lineup, and Hujiang soared, taking the lead with a score of thirty-three to nineteen. Nansing suffered a major setback, tried its best to cope, and gradually caught up, but in the end lost by three points with a score of thirty-three to thirty. Nansing's Chen Wenkuo's performance was unique.</p>
<h3>China Sports Federation Women's Basketball Tournament: Chongde Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The strength of sixteen to six is vastly different. Yan Weiwen was monitored, resulting in a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>The China Sports Federation's annual women's basketball league, since its inception, Chongde first defeated Patriot with a score of nineteen to nine, then defeated Guanghua with a score of twenty-five to one. Yesterday, they defeated Qixiu again with a score of sixteen to six, winning this year's championship. Another match between Patriot and Guanghua was postponed to Wednesday due to unforeseen circumstances. If Patriot defeats Guanghua at that time, they will have to compete with Qixiu for the second and third place positions. The situation of yesterday's game is recorded below.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Chongde versus Qixiu, held at Chongde Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, judged by Lu Xiangqian. Because this battle was related to the championship, the competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. Chongde's Li Yunzhi was unusually fierce and opened the scoring. Qixiu's Wen Yuan was not to be outdone and returned the favor. At the beginning of the second quarter, Chongde's center Yang Shaoqi scored, and Lin Kuanrao added icing to the cake, leaving the Qixiu ladies with only the ability to parry, but no ability to retaliate. At the end of the first half, Chongde took the lead with a score of eight to two.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Qixiu tried to counterattack, but Yan Weiwen was closely monitored by Chongde's Chen Yue'e and Guo Xinhua, resulting in no development at all. Chongde's three forwards passed to each other and gained points. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Qixiu's Wen Yuan and Xu Peiying had a wonderful cooperation, so they managed to pull back four points. After that, they fell into a slump again, while Chongde's Li Yunzhi, Yang Shaoqi, and others were active all over the field and had great momentum. At the end of the second half, Chongde took the lead again with a score of eight to four. As a result, Chongde defeated Qixiu with a score of sixteen to six. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Special Silver Shield Football Begins: South China Draws with Lincoln</h3>
<p>Neither side scores</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 14th) The Hong Kong Special Silver Shield Football Tournament began on the 14th. South China drew with the Lincoln team with a score of zero to zero.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private High School Football Tournament: Jinling Retains Championship</h3>
<p>John defeats Yancheng to win second place</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) In the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private High School Football Tournament, Jinling and John competed for the football championship at 9 AM on the 14th.

In the end, Jinling defeated John with a score of eight to one and retained the championship. At 3 PM, John and Yancheng competed for second place. As a result, John scored one goal in the first half, and each side scored two goals in the second half. In summary, John won with a score of three to two.</p>
<h3>Tiecheng Cup: East China Easily Defeats Patriot</h3>
<p>Zhang Sumei is extraordinary and scores the most points. The East Asia vs. Jiangwan match was postponed yesterday due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Of the five Tiecheng Cup basketball matches originally scheduled yesterday, both teams from Youmo and Jiangwan requested a postponement because they were participating in the Jiangnan University football match. Therefore, the men's Group A match between Jiangwan and East Asia, and the men's Group B match between Tianxing and Youmo, were not held. The results of the three matches that were held are as follows:</p>
<p>Fuyi defeats Jiangdong (B3) 27 to 26</p>
<p>East China defeats Patriot (Women's B) 17 to 9</p>
<p>All Blacks defeat Sea Whale (B1) 34 to 6</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Men's Situation</p>
<p>Originally, there were seven teams participating in the Men's Group A of the Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament. After Hanliang withdrew, there were only six teams: Jiangwan, Zhenru, Chizhi, East Asia, Tongji, and Guanghua. Based on their strength, the teams with the best chance of winning the championship are Jiangwan, East Asia, and Chizhi, especially Jiangwan. However, in the past two matches, Jiangwan has not shown its skills due to unforeseen circumstances. If they compete against East Asia and Chizhi, there will be exciting performances to entertain us. As for the Women's Group A, only three schools are participating: Liangjiang, East Asia, and Jinan. Liangjiang has already defeated East Asia in the first match. Jinan's strength is average, so the championship will belong to Liangjiang. The strength of Liangjiang, East China, and Chongde is relatively strong in the Women's Group B. Based on the situation, East China may be able to defeat Chongde, but there will be a fierce battle when they meet Liangjiang. It is still difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>East China Defeats Patriot</p>
<p>Yesterday, East China and Patriot played in the Women's Group B match. The rural audience was still enthusiastic. The ladies were not used to the gym battle, because the floor was as smooth as an ice rink, and they would fall as soon as they moved their feet. Therefore, their actions were like little birds dancing, unable to act boldly and courageously. The situation was quite funny. Although their feet were covered in lime, they still had the feeling of not being able to move. The East China players were more experienced because they had already played a match in the Cloud Trial. Zhang Sumei was extraordinary and agile as a swallow. Shi Ouqing was also able to cope with ease, while Patriot's Ye Xihua was the smallest in stature, but her movements were agile, like Liangjiang's Pan Meng. Given time, she will definitely become a good general. In the first half, East China took the lead with a score of thirteen to four. As a result, East China won with a score of seventeen to nine.</p>

Graduates from previous sessions who have served in various telecommunications agencies of the national transportation, military, and political sectors have been highly praised and trusted by all parties.

In order to take into account the economic situation of the general public, the school, starting from the next term, will reduce part of the tuition, accommodation, and other fees. The number of free places will still be set up, and in order to facilitate young people from distant provinces to study, the school will consider the situation and allow them to take the exam upon arrival.

<h3>Little Women (1)(2)(4)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>He jumped over the wall and ran so fast that she almost couldn't catch up. But when she reached that place, he put down the lantern and happily showed her the small footprints on the loose soil by the spring. She knelt down to examine the continuous footprints, then jumped up and said eagerly, "Really; these are the marks of my Rob's little boots! Let's go this way, they might have gone into the path." This was such a tiring search! But this worried mother had an inexplicable power guiding her because soon Don called out again, he had found another shiny little thing on the road. This was the lid of that tin toy bucket, probably lost when they first realized they were lost. Mrs. Shu hurriedly picked it up, hugged it tightly, and kissed it as if it were a treasure. When Don was about to cheer and call everyone over, she stopped him, but hurried on, saying, "No, let me find them; I let Rob go, so I want to send him back to his father myself." A little further on, Nan's hat was found, and after repeatedly passing through the place where the children were, they finally found the two children, both fast asleep in the woods. Don could never forget that little picture that the light of his lantern illuminated that night. He thought Mrs. Shu was going to shout, but she only whispered, "Don't make a sound!" Gently lifting the apron, she saw the little rosy faces under the skirt. Their breathing, their lips dyed with the color of berries, were half-open, the yellow hair on their foreheads was soaked with sweat, and the little, thick, chubby hands were still tightly holding onto the full little bucket.</p>

<h3>Finance: Hovering and Preparing, Standard Gold Price Falls Another Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Many Arbitrage Transactions in This Term's Swap Finance, New Lineup of February Contracts Exceeds 10,000</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw swap transactions; the half-day market situation was flat and mostly speculative. Although the price once retreated into the 40-yuan range, it was only briefly so. The foreign exchange market was still stable, the discount narrowed, gradually becoming peaceful after weakness. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market reported large volumes of forward contracts, still halted, near-term contracts shrank to 43.75. It was still said that there were a large number of sellers, and the United States bought 18% of the supply. US banks further reduced by one cent. The Montreux forward silver price had rebounded by 2.5% to 2 cents. Exchange rates lengthened slightly. London spot gold fell by one penny. Because of swap-related concerns, it was difficult for sentiment to change. The central bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The customs gold unit fell by four cents, and the standard gold price listing retreated to 1147.3 yuan. The off-market pre-trading opened at 43.4 yuan, and major players such as Fuxing, Yongchunyuan, Yongyifeng, and Yonghuixiang immediately sold, falling to 41.2 yuan. The morning opened with a low market, and swap transactions had already begun, with the bulls posting around 9.5 yuan. After the opening, major players continued to exert pressure, suddenly showing an oversupply, immediately breaking the 40-yuan mark, falling to 39.8 yuan. However, because most of the sellers were floating, it was quickly maintained. Mobil continued to buy US dollars, the foreign exchange market was peaceful, and buyers were able to easily pull up the price. However, because the HSBC bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the swap discount rose and fell suddenly, the market price lacked special changes, making short-term hovering, lingering between 41 and 42 yuan for quite a while. The silver equalization tax fell by 2.25 cents, but sentiment was not stimulated. Major players made purchases, rising to 43.2 yuan, but sellers also surged along with the high price. Soon there was another small setback. Finally, demand and supply were mediocre, and the Indian silver forecast was also flat, so the overall trend was stable, but the close reversed and became firm. This term's swap for February contracts saw the shorts posting 8.8 to 10 yuan, the overall trend stabilized, and there were quite a few arbitrageurs in the financial sector. The discount narrowed from high to low. Here are the records of this half-day market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1141.6 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from the previous close. Qianyuan Yong Fuxing Yong immediately reached 39.8 yuan. Yifeng Yongheng Yu Dacheng Zhentai Nata raised to 41 yuan. Fuxing, Yong Yuanmao Yong sold off, but Hengyu Houyu Shangjin and many bulls Hongkang Yongda Dacheng Huixiang sold together, falling to 0.8 yuan. Yuanmao Yongsheng Mao Yifeng Yongwuyi Yongli bought in succession, rising to 2.4 yuan. Chunyuan Yongda Dacheng Fuxing Yong Tongyu Runyu Xinxiang took the opportunity to supply at high prices, retreating to 1.7 yuan. The HSBC bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, and sentiment remained stable. The swap was slightly cheaper. Dacheng Hengyu Shangjin reached 2.2 yuan. Fuxing Yongda Feng Yuanchang Yongyicheng sold their positions, falling to 1.1 yuan. Fuxing Yong Yuan Yi Dafayong Da Dacheng Lichang took the opportunity to buy in, rising to 3 yuan. However, because the swap returned to large volumes, Dafayong Fuxing Yong Da Dacheng sold to 2 yuan. Chunyuan Yong Dingtai Dingkang Da Dacheng Shunmao Hengyu Nata put down positions. The silver equalization tax was announced, falling by 2.25 cents, reversing and rising to 3.2 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Jinlong Yifeng Yong Qingfa Yong Da Dacheng Wuyi Heng and others sold slightly, falling to 1.3 yuan. Hengyu Yifeng Yong Chunyuan Yong and others took advantage of the low price to reach 2.4 yuan. Zhentai took the opportunity to supply at high prices, retreating to 1.7 yuan. The Indian silver forecast did not move, the overall trend was mediocre. Fuxing Yong Shang slightly bought in, rising to 2.3 yuan. After hovering, the noon close was 1142.1 yuan. After the close, Yifeng Yong bought positions from time to time, once rising to 4 yuan. After Chunyuan Yong took the opportunity to supply at high prices, it retreated to within 3.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was 247.3 yuan according to the central bank's standard gold price listing, which, according to the closing price, was about 5 yuan lower, more than 1 yuan lower than the previous close.

Red gold was still at parity with the futures price, at 1141.6 yuan. The spot market was stable. Refined red gold was quoted at 6.5 yuan more, and Tianjin goods were also quoted at 6.5 yuan more, both transacted. This was because this month's positions have been cleared, and various firms were paying attention to the new swap contracts.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In summary, Yuanyi Dingkang Chunyuan Yong Hengyu Dingtai Yifeng Yong Xiang Feng Xiang and Shunmao, etc., were on the buying side. Yuxinxiang Shenfeng Yuanshengyong Fuxing Yong Yongli Run Huixiang Fuyu Dacheng Wanfeng Yongde, etc., were on the selling side.

The central bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The customs gold unit fell by 4 , and Chinese merchants' sentiment was once depressed, but because banks took advantage of the cheap price to buy settlements, Mobil also paid, and after the opening, it turned slightly tight. The HSBC bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. At this time, because banks took advantage of the high price to sell, there was a lot of speculation, and after the silver equalization tax was announced, it fell by 2.25 cents. Banks engaged in both buying and selling, and there was no impact. Chinese merchants slightly had a stomach, and the trend was still stable. The forecast for Indian silver did not move.

<h3>Securities: All Bonds Fell, Except for Troop Reduction Bonds, Which Rose Uniquely</h3>
<p>—Bulls Turned to Sell and Close—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange's market situation became increasingly unsustainable. Most of the large bull players could not maintain their original lines, and those who came out of the cage and went short were endless. Market rumors mostly favored the short side, sentiment was gradually weakening, and the future still had a downward trend. However, the troop reduction bonds suddenly had an abnormal upward trend, soaring by a huge yuan throughout the day, which was not without the involvement of market makers. With rapid advances and sudden retreats, could there be no reaction?</p>
<p>Yesterday's course: at the morning opening, the demobilization bonds were slightly weak first, followed by the troop reduction bonds opening. At 22.65, there were suddenly huge volumes of buying, and the market price was raised from 82.5 yuan to a peak of 83.2 yuan, a sharp rise of nearly a yuan. In theory, the subsequent series should have trended upward, but general bulls took the opportunity to come out of the cage one after another, and the selling of 78 and 22 was particularly strong. A downward trend suddenly arose, and the subsequent series actually fell back by three to five cents. In the final settlement, the troop reduction counter continued to raise by two cents. The 19 Customs bonds and the good settlement all fell. However, the retail appetite suddenly turned smooth at the 20 Customs bonds, and the subsequent series actually returned to two or three cents. At the noon opening, the demobilization bonds rose by half a yuan weakly, and the troop reduction bonds rose by another two cents. Later, the bulls tended to cut positions, and the downward trend was interrupted and then continued. Most fell by about five to three cents. At the close, the selling side surged, and the bulls on the bidding side closed a lot, and the market price fell by another three to five cents.</p>
<p>In summary, the result of the market price for the whole day, except for the troop reduction bonds, which soared by a yuan, the demobilization bonds and troop reduction bonds forward were flat, and the remaining months fell by three to five cents to as much as seven to eight cents. The total transaction volume was 19,415,000 yuan. Here is a list of the highs and lows: (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market: Many Bulls Come Out of the Cage</h3>
<p>According to a report from New Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 13th) the New York stock market saw many bulls taking profits and coming out of the cage, part of which were European clients, and the price slightly decreased with a difference. Small exchange stocks fell slightly, and the bond market saw ups and downs. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.89 million shares. Here is a list of the Dow Jones New York Index:</p>
<h3>Yarn: Short Pressure on Futures Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, and the situation gradually became weak. This was because, in this month, as the delivery period approached, the short side prepared a sufficient amount of spot yarn for delivery, and the pressure suddenly became severe. Sentiment was frustrated. However, the large amounts of money from the financial sector had not completely come out of the cage, and the market situation for far-term months was still high, and some financial firms were still dragging in.</p>
<p>Selling Starts and Falls Back. At the yarn market pre-opening, because the overseas yarn flower situation rebounded, the market sentiment was slightly stabilized, and the near-term month rose by seven to eight cents. When bidding to far-term months, the upward force was weak. At the second bid opening, a decline was suddenly seen. Fortunately, cotton was firm, and the yarn market could still bring a tighter step. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, 4, and 7 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the upward trend suddenly rose, with each month jumping seven or eight cents, because fenmai was rising. Unexpectedly, Xu Gao came to vigorously sell off again, and the market chips suddenly became loose and flooded. The third closing price tended to fall downward. As a result, the near-term month fell by one cent to one yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the far-term fell by 3, 4, and 5 cents. However, the May contract rose by three cents. It was found that Da Ji sold 1,250 bales, Mingde 1,850 bales, Jinchang 600 bales, Minghua 550 bales, Renfeng 450 bales, Dachangcheng 450 bales, Taichang 690 bales, Gengfeng 500 bales, Yicheng hundred bales, Yichang 850 bales, and Hengchang 800 bales. Jinchang bought 700 bales, Dafu 550 bales, Dafeng 500 bales, Senkang 900 bales, Yicheng 450 bales, Yongda 650 bales, Xincheng 750 bales, Taichang 750 bales, Yongchang 1,000 bales, and Jinkang 2,100 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are as follows:</p>
<p>The spot market price did not rise much. Spot yarn sales were still good. It was found that the statistics of each firm's congratulatory goings for the whole day were 615 bales, and the market situation was no different from the above. The amounts for each firm are as follows:</p>
<h3>Cotton Bulls Display Their Power</h3>
<p>The cotton market was firm and the rising trend was very strong. This was because the overseas Indian and American cotton markets turned upward after falling, and at the same time, the bull pulling force of the major firm Xincheng Tongji was particularly strong, so the market situation became more and more firm, which was inversely proportional to the yarn price. However, the demand for spot cotton was quite sluggish.</p>
<p>Futures cotton almost rose step by step. At the standard cotton pre-opening, the American cotton rose 11 to 18 pounds after falling, the Indian cotton rose 3.5 rupees, and the Osaka three-product cotton also rose by several cents. The market sentiment was slightly shaken yesterday, and the market price rose step by step. As a result, each month rose from four cents from prior closing. At the afternoon opening, it suddenly jumped up three and a half cents. Because the fen market was soaring, the market was excited and the buying was strong. When bidding to the second and third bids, the cotton market began to decrease as the yarn market wasn’t working out so well. Consequently, the numbers were slightly different with the prior day numbers with 0.05 to 0.15 cents from the first closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 2,100 dan, Daji 2,700 dan, Yuanda 1,400 dan, Mingde 2,000 dan, Dachangcheng 2,000 dan, Yichang 2,000 dan, Changhe 7,100 dan, Shengyuan 1,200 zu, Xincheng 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,200 dan, Hexing bought 1,400 dan, Mingde 1,300 zu, Dafu 2,400 dan, Tongji 1,200 dan, Yuda 3,800 dan, Zhenda 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Runkang 4,300 dan, Xincheng 5,400 dan, Yikang 1,600 dan, Taichang 1,400 dan, Yongchang 1,400 dan. The highest and lowest in a day, as well as the day's closing, is shown in the following table.</p>
<p>Spot Arrival and Sales are Both Cold. Spot cotton sales are becoming more and more silent. Factory helpers are stopping. The sources count Yao flower 2,050 bales, and Tongzhou flower 1,750 bales.</p>
<p>American Cotton Industry Awaits Supreme Court Ruling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, because the Liverpool news was good, the wheat market was strong, and the industry and foreign firms absorbed the amounts of set selling and bullish selling, so each month rose from nine to eleven pounds. However, the needs were mostly sluggish. In fact, after the recent large number of bulls closed out, it seemed more stable. Unfortunately, there were not many new buys at the moment. At the same time, the industry was waiting for the ruling of the Supreme Court. Spot cotton was silent, and the feet were still available. Textiles were firm and sluggish. Hestad estimates that this week's factory use was 308,000 bales, and Liverpool's reserves were 294,000 bales. The closing was firm, counting the spot rise by 0.5 pounds, and the futures rise by 11 to 18 pounds. British cotton spot rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 12 to 13 points. Indian cotton was firm because of buying by futures traders and operators. European exporters had both buying and selling, counting Pingguo Er rising by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, Aomura rising by 0.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising by 2.5 rupees. The original telegraph record is on the left (13th electric).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi flower on the 14th was 221.5 rupees, a rise of 1 rupee compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Wheat Soars, Fenmai Soars</h3>
<p>The fen market opened in the morning, and each month suddenly saw a high rise, with the degree of difference in each month averaging 0.123. Transactions totaled more than 180,000 bags. As for the source of the rising trend, the foreign quotation, Chicago rose by a huge 1.56 yuan, Canada rose by about 1 yuan, and 物利浦 rose by 4.75 pence. The market sentiment was even more panic-stricken because the factories had absorbed chips for several days. There was also news of overseas sideways jumps, so the opening price rose by five or six cents, and then the non-industry shorts painfully made up their positions, and the market price soared by another five or six cents, compared to the previous day's closing. , all rose by a huge 0.134 yuan. When the afternoon opened, the near term initially saw stability, but the far term returned because the profit-making bulls returned, and there would be a small one or two cents. Later, because the bulls had a large number of purchases again, the market continued to rebound. The ending was similar to the morning closing price. Looking at the changes in the overseas wheat market, there is a huge relationship with our country's market, so speculators cannot lean too heavily on one side.</p>
<p>The wheat market also soared unanimously after the opening. Because foreign wheat was soaring, the general people speculated that there was a problem with silver, or that exporters restricted exports, resulting in a peculiar rising trend, and operators could not do anything. Therefore, the quotations of each file initially soared by one dime, and then continued to rise to about two dimes. When the afternoon opened, the wheat market was high, the market's buying was strong, and the enthusiasm was abnormal. Each month continued to rise by about one dime. The current rising trend is purely driven by the price of wheat outside of Tao, so the subsequent decline will still be transferred from abroad, and the domestic supply and demand can't be talked about for a while. The current wheat is stopped because of the chaotic standards of factories. To the customer, high goods shout again to five levels.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat, because the Argentine government announced a minimum price of 90 cents, was like a bolt from the blue. The world market soared unanimously. Today, Canada's wheat exports reached 10 million bushels, but the price was settled at yesterday's price. If it is sold at today's price, what will be the reaction of foreign countries? It is difficult to reverse the forecast. Chicago may still want to buy 1.5 million bushels when it closes. I heard that Argentina's wheat rose by 20 cents.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Step Back Small</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, each helper's source arrived at more than 40 (a total of more than 8,000 stones of goods), and the sales market in this street was still sluggish. Buns were handled by helpers from Tianjin and Qingdao, with more than 4,000 buns. However, the market situation was depressed, and the market price was still difficult to maintain, so the result was that the thin rice went for a little bit. The price of thick early japonica rice fell a few cents. Sheyangjian also had a little bit left over for five cents. Only the shadow became yuan, the way was still steady.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various riversides were quite prosperous, about 50 or 60. The sale of white japonica rice in the market was brisk. The store sales were still sluggish. The hoarders were skillful, and the price was again a few cents to nearly a dime. Early japonica rice was also a small dime. The bao stomach of thin rice was lacking in trade, and the retail was also stagnant. The market was tired for a dime. The lamb ridge tips were normal, the market was small for one cent, the lamb ridge tips were small for a few cents, the guest tips were lacking, the white yuan wine users moved a little, and the retail was quite active. The price rose two dimes, and the price shape of the remaining goods was more tired than the previous market.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) The transaction was silent, the floating inventory in the market was sparse, and the warehouses planned to pull up. The shippers had no intention of asking about the prosperous arrival of客秈. 客秈 arrived yesterday still涌,允 because Jiangxi rice came in uninterruptedly, and the turning was not strong, the owners had to depreciate the price for pleasure, because the price was reduced to near a dime to the outside of the dime. The arrivals and sales of other各秈 were flat, with small increases and decreases. The tong market opened 1,250 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,129 bags of Yi台rice, 250 bags of Beijing rice, and 340 bags of闽米. All were handled by this office.</p>
<h3>Foreign Zhuang Sesame Rises Again Two Dimes</h3>
<p>Soybean Sales Market Turns Around</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign zhuang sesame rose another two dimes, opening 300 tons, and still ordered the delivery of January and February. As a result, more than 2,000 bags of spot raw goods were traded. Because the mainland oil mills asked about soybeans, the factories in this city also took measures, so the market atmosphere turned lively, and the market price rose two or three cents. A total of more than 5,000 bags of beans were opened. In addition to the 2,000 bags of Du, soy sauce, and yellow handled by the Guangzhou helper Fuzhou in this street, the rest were for the two-way path of the oil pressing factories.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Statistics on Shanghai Raw Silk Exports in November</h3>
<p>According to the report of the silk inspection group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the number of Shanghai raw silk exports in November of this year was 7,191 bales, a decrease of 1,752 bales compared with 8,943 bales last month. The number of waste silk bales was 3,809 bales, an increase of 943 bales compared with 2,866 bales last month. Detailed figures are in the table below:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Unrefined and Refined White Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The sugar market remained tight yesterday. However, due to it being Saturday, there were few transactions. The association's price quotations were: 24 grade unrefined white sugar, spot price, called at $22.15; re-export price at $6.95. For the following, each one is $0.25.

<p>North-South Goods: Watermelon Seeds Supply Not Abundant</p>
<p>Due to the poor harvest of black watermelon seeds this year, prices have been rising since the new crop came out. Recently, with the Lunar New Year approaching, sales have decreased, causing the upward trend to ease and even decline. Compared to the highest price, it has dropped nearly a dollar. However, a check of current market inventory shows only around 　ten thousand packages, significantly less than in previous years, so the market price is expected to rise again.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Tailored Suit Fabric Shops Reluctant to Wholesale</h3>
<p>— Prices Expected to Rise After the New Year —</p>
<p>Although tailored suit flannel is also seeing price increases, due to the variety of colors, it is not as significant as the increases in general merchandise, which are not surprising even at several dimes. Fabric shops with samples available are finding it difficult to raise prices due to various reasons. Therefore, their policy on wholesale fabric business has also changed. They have stopped door-to-door sales. Brokers who come to buy will have prices calculated according to the sample code. They would rather not wholesale, deciding to wait until after the New Year. Insiders predict that flannel imports will decrease significantly after the New Year, resulting in high costs, and fabric prices are sure to rise another two cents. Therefore, fabric shops plan to hold on until the end of the year, collecting all the samples, and are generally not welcoming current transactions.</p>

<h3>Wishing You to Be a Philanthropist</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>The weather gets colder day by day. The compatriots living in the disaster areas are certainly very distressed! They are only wearing thin clothes, standing in the howling north wind, feeling as if their faces are being cut. They are waiting for us to rescue them. Little friends! Please listen to a word from me! Do you want to be a philanthropist? Ha! Ha! We have already donated the money we would have spent on candy to help with disaster relief. Are you asking us to give money again? No, no, absolutely not. I don't need you to give a single cent. Don't be anxious, just listen to what I have to say!</p>
<p>The weather is cold, and your mothers have already taken out your cotton-padded jackets and pants to air them out, waiting for you to wear them. But when you wear them, are there any that you don't want to wear, clothes that are too small? If so, then you can ask your father to make you new ones. Donate the old, unwearable clothes to the Shanghai News Disaster Relief Committee. Wouldn't that mean you don't have to spend a single cent? If you have cotton hats, cotton shoes, etc., they are also very welcome.</p>
<p>Little friends all over the country! Hurry up and look in your boxes, try them on. Gather the old, small clothes together, count them, how many pieces are there in total? For example, if there are two hundred million children in the country, and each child donates a set of cotton-padded jackets and pants, then there will be two hundred million sets of clothes. The children in the disaster areas will not freeze to death. Alas! Little friends! Would you like to be a philanthropist without spending a single cent? Get up! Put this effective disaster relief method into practice.</p>
<h3>The Children of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Abyssinia in Africa is now resisting Italy with all its might. Although Abyssinia is a small African country with barren land, poor people, and a low level of culture, the people of Abyssinia have strong physiques and an indomitable spirit. Despite the oppression of Italy's modern bombers and tanks, the Abyssinians keep charging forward wave after wave. Their bravery and strength are unmatched by any other nation. Therefore, I would like to introduce the children of Abyssinia to the little friends here.</p>
<p>Abyssinia is a tropical country, so children there do not wear clothes all year round. They only start wearing short trousers at around the age of ten. Children in rural areas rarely wear short trousers, usually just using a narrow strip of cloth to cover their front and back private parts.</p>
<p>The children there are naturally very strong and healthy, so they can run by the time they are two years old. After they can run, they play outdoors almost every day, all day long. They are not afraid of the sun, not afraid of the rain. They can play in sunlight above 100 degrees. They can also run and chase in the rain. Because they are exposed to the sun and rain all year round, their bodies are extremely healthy.</p>
<p>Schools are very few in Abyssinia. There are only five schools in the capital. Apart from two run by the French Church, the Abyssinian-owned schools only have three. The two run by the French Church, one is a complete primary school, and the other is a secondary school with a two-year program and a primary school course. In addition to the Amharic language, they also teach French. There are a total of more than one hundred and sixty students. The Abyssinian-owned schools only teach Amharic, with a total of more than two hundred and twenty students. There is no distinction between primary and secondary schools, and it takes four years to graduate. In Abyssinia, at least the sons of landowners should be able to go to school. Girls do not have the right to study. The sons of commoners do not study.</p>
<p>According to the customs there, learning martial arts is more valued than learning literature. So every boy, around the age of ten, whether noble or commoner, must practice climbing mountains, riding horses, boxing, and archery. Even if they are eaten by wild animals in the mountains, or injured in fights with other children, their parents will never feel sorry for them. The more they love to fight and take risks, the more their parents love them. Girls must also undergo this kind of training at around the age of ten. The stronger they are, the more admired they are.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, in Abyssinia, many children are sold to landlords' homes to be slaves because their parents are poor and unable to support them, or they are lured by kidnappers. They are driven like livestock to farm, carry heavy loads, or perform other labor. 　Even children around the age of ten have already become slaves.</p>
<h3>Lowering the Flag</h3>
<p>— Chen Zheng</p>
<p>Lowering the flag on National Humiliation Memorial Day,</p>
<p>The children are unhappy in their hearts!</p>
<p>Teacher! Why not raise the flag high,</p>
<p>So that it can raise its eyebrows and exhale in the gentle breeze?</p>
<p>Children! You must remember,</p>
<p>Why are the sons of great China,</p>
<p>Often bullied by foreigners?</p>
<p>If you want the flag to raise its eyebrows and exhale in the air,</p>
<p>First, everyone must unite their hearts.</p>
<p>Endure hardship and bide our time, the whole country unites together.</p>
<p>Identify the goal, work hard and fight to wash away the national humiliation;</p>
<p>Then the national flag 　will always raise its eyebrows and exhale in the air!</p>
<p>No longer lower the flag.</p>

<p>A Banana Country</p>
<p>Who hasn't eaten bananas? This lovely fruit is really worth praising: "Cheap and good!" But little friends, do you also know that in Central America there is a country famous for producing bananas? This is Honduras.</p>
<p>Terrain Like a Mushroom</p>
<p>Where is Honduras? It faces the Caribbean Sea to the east and north, borders Nicaragua to the south, and borders El Salvador to the west. From the terrain, the east, north, and west sides are large, while the south side is uniquely small, looking just like a mushroom 　　(Figure 2).</p>
<p>A Five-Star Flag</p>
<p>The flag of Honduras: the upper 　and lower ends are two blue stripes, with a white stripe in the middle. There are also five blue stars on this white stripe. The style is very beautiful. (Figure 1)</p>
<p>A Warm Capital</p>
<p>The capital of Honduras is Tegucigalpa, located in the south 　of the country, built at a high place 　975 meters above sea level. The weather there is very warm and suitable for health, but the population is not large, only 40,000, which is not as good as our first-class cities in China.</p>
<p>Living on Bananas</p>
<p>As mentioned above: Honduras is famous for producing bananas. Bananas are the country's main product. The income of the people mainly relies on growing bananas and selling bananas. Then, if we say that Hondurans live on bananas, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Other Products</p>
<p>In addition to bananas, Honduras also exports large amounts of coffee. In addition, cocoa and tobacco are also produced in large quantities. Straw hats are also very famous. (Figure 4)</p>
<p>Mixed-Race People</p>
<p>Honduras has a total area of 44,275 square miles and a population of 774,000. The majority of them are mixed-race people of Mestizos and blacks, and the rest are Indians and blacks. Spanish is their national language. When we look at Figures 3 and 5, we will know what the clothing of men and women in this country is like.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>What is an "air defense drill"? Little friends may not know, so I am here today to talk about this air defense drill. This is also a necessary piece of common sense!</p>
<p>Because of the development of science, the current war tools are divided into three types. The first is the army: which advances by land, like cavalry and infantry, are all part of the army. The second is the navy; which advances by water. The third is the air force! Because they ride airplanes and fly around in the sky, they are called the air force. Nowadays, the combat power of the air force is the strongest. They throw bombs from the air. No matter how vast the area or how populous the large city is, just a few huge bombs can turn it into a flat land. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, we suffered a lot from the Japanese airplanes. Therefore, after the end of the January 28th Shanghai War, our country considered the prevention of airplane attacks to be very important, so we held air defense drills. In the past two years, Nanjing, Hankou and other places have held them.</p>
<p>In air defense drills, the most important thing is to practice air raid warnings. This warning is divided into four types: The first is an air raid 　warning; when we receive this warning, we know that the enemy's planes (hypothetical) are coming! The second 　is an emergency warning; this warning tells us that the enemy's plane has arrived. At this time, we must quickly implement "light control", turn off all the lights, so that the enemy planes cannot get a target. The third is a poison gas warning: this is a warning that the enemy plane is releasing poison gas. We must close the windows and doors tightly, and at the same time wear a gas mask to prevent the attack of poison gas. The fourth is a cancellation of the warning: that is a sign that the enemy plane has left, and we can work as usual!</p>
<p>Little friends, air defense drills are a preparation. In case something unfortunate happens in the future, we will not be flustered. Therefore, the significance of air defense drills is very important.</p>
<h3>The Philosopher and the Children</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhoukang</p>
<p>One day, an Eastern philosopher walked to a country near him 　. In a village, he saw several children clamoring that they were hungry. The mother made breakfast for them, placed it in front of them, distributed it, and then told them to start eating.</p>
<p>Just as these children were putting food to their mouths, many rude people suddenly broke in and snatched their cups and plates. At this time, their mother remained quiet and silent, and these children also remained calm.</p>
<p>The philosopher was very surprised when he saw this, and asked the mother, "What is the reason for this?" She replied, "Sir, you don't have to ask now, please watch and see!" Just as the children were about to finish these two sentences, they all set off heroically and went to find their breakfast. But the breakfast had been hidden, and they used all their searching methods and finally found it.</p>
<p>The mother turned her head and said to the philosopher, "Sir, you have seen clearly! In our country, all our children are educated and cultivated like this when they are children. So that they are rich in patience and the qualities of not being timid or cowardly, full of courage and firm ambition. All difficult things must be solved by them automatically, without any dependence on others. You must know that the reason why people develop to a successful step is entirely built on the fact that they can endure hardships and hold on to a spirit and perseverance without disappointment when they start their careers. This is the method of cultivating our children's autonomy in our country."</p>

<p>Instructions</p>
<p>Mei, Niu, and Lan Sheng wanted to learn art, but couldn't find materials, so they went out on stilts to enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>The elder brother took out a telescope to look at the winter scenery, the younger brother was not careful, lost his footing and fell to the ground, covered in snow.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a painter sketching the snow scene, and the two went closer to take a closer look. After the brothers returned home, they first made a snowman as a painting model. 　This　painting is their first practice work.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Fish Egg Incubation</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>(1) Carp, crucian carp, and goldfish lay their eggs in aquatic 　plants in the water, which are naturally incubated. (2) 　Fish lay their eggs on the rocks in streams and incubate them. (3) Salmon and cod are marine fish. When they lay eggs, they go upstream to the river and use their tails to scrape away small stones to lay their eggs in them. After laying their eggs, they use their fins to cover the small stones over the eggs. (4) The largemouth bass lays eggs in a very strange way. The male fish uses its mouth to receive the eggs laid by the female fish, holding them in its mouth for incubation. The male fish will not eat no matter how hungry it is until the eggs hatch. (5) The eggs laid by the Hata fish in the sea are strung on seaweed, like a string of beads. (6) The small fish is also one of the marine fish. The eggs laid by the female fish fall into the pouch on the abdomen of the male fish for incubation. (7) Eels lay their eggs, and they must lie on the deepest seabed. Eels on the east coast of Europe and America must swim to the deep seabed north of Cuba to lay their eggs.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Children's Friend"</h3>
<p>— Shen Yunfang, Student of Qixiu Girls' School</p>
<p>I am a child, so of course I like to make friends. Now that we 　have a "Children's Friend" that everyone recognizes, we naturally have to get to know it.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I and Sister Yan Ying combined two dimes to ask my brother to buy this thick "Children's Friend" in the Shanghai News. We have to read it for a long time every day, and we are very happy. There are children's forums, children's science, labor, common sense, celebrity anecdotes... and other twelve chapters, plus exquisite newspapers and magazines. The content can be said to be very rich.</p>
<p>Now that we children have this good friend, everything feels happy! Our compositions have improved, our stories have increased, and we don't have to worry about lacking entertainment.</p>
<p>"Children's Friend" is really our children's "Friend"!</p>
<h3>The Legend of the Righteous Dog (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Nello and Patrasche were both alone in this world. They were a good friend and their friendship ran deeper than brotherhood.</p>
<p>They were born the same year in this world, but one was young while the other was old. They were always together, both were lonely and poor, and so they depended on each other for survival as the best of friends. Their intial connection was born of sympathy, as if their hearts were one. They became closer each day, inseparable from each other.</p>
<p>Their home was a small cottage near a small village! This village was three miles away from Antwerp, located in the middle of meadows and rice fields. Long rows of poplars and alders moved in the breeze along the bank of a large canal.</p>
<p>The village contained about twenty houses, with light-green or sky-blue windows. The roofs were rose-red or black and white, and the walls were very white, which shined in the sun like snow. At the center of the village, there stood a windmill upon a mossy slope! People from around the village could see the landmark. The windmill was painted red fifty years ago, when it was used by Napoleon's troops to grind wheat: only the years of wind and weather had changed the color to red-brown. The windmill always moves in a curious fashion, as if an old person suffers from rheumatism, which stiffens the joints. But the neighbours were grateful for it, as it was said that the windmill transported luck and prosperity to the village. Across from the windmill there was a small, dark-grey church. Above the building was a bell tower, which tolled a low, empty sound at morning, noon, and night. Nearby villages answered with the same sound.</p>
<p>Within the area that the small bell tower could reach, Nello and Patrasche lived in a small cottage. To the northeast, they could see the tower of the Antwerp cathedral in the distance, plus plains and rice fields, which appeared to them as a green sea. The small cottage belonged to old man Daas, who had been a soldier in his youth. He still remembered the wars that trampled on the fields like bulls across the trenches. All he returned from the war with was an injury that left him disabled.</p>
<p>When old Daas was 80, his daughter died in Ath, leaving behind a two-year-old son for him to raise. He was too poor to support himself, but he welcomed his grandson without a word of complaint. After that, Nello and his old man were content to live in their cottage.</p>
<p>The cottage was made of dirt, but was very white and clean, like a shell by the sea. A small garden in four sides grew beans, vegetables, pumpkins, and plants.</p>

<h3>Gonorrhea Immunotherapy</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yuan Yimin</p>
<p>Therefore, the injection of gonorrhea serum, pathogens, or gonococcal toxins into the patient's body causes the body to produce immunity to gonorrhea in order to achieve a therapeutic effect. Among these three, the more accurate and commonly used one is gonorrhea pathogens. The production of this injection is to strictly kill multiple types of gonococci and accompanying bacteria of wood disease, such as staphylococcus, and mix them with a special, harmless muscular fluid. That is what is commonly known as gonorrhea vaccine. This is very effective for treating gonorrhea. Even chronic gonorrhea that has been incurable for many years, and various gonococcal diseases, such as arthritis, orchitis, oophoritis, and cystitis, can be rapidly effective with it. Cross-this drug can also help diagnose this disease. Sometimes, gonorrhea that appears to be cured is actually latent. Once this drug is injected, it will immediately react, repeating urethral discharge, just like the first onset of gonorrhea. At this time, it is only necessary to continue the injection of mixed gonococci, and then apply short-wave diathermy electrical therapy. The heat generated by the generator penetrates the deep layers of the tissue, completely destroying the gonococci. At the same time, "Me:allropin," a powerful membrane-penetrating bactericide, can be taken internally to reduce urethral pain and achieve a synergistic effect. As for the urethra locally, either the "Collargol" drug sterilization method is used, or the gonorrhea serum "Gono-Serol" is injected to supplement the power of the mixed gonococcal injection. This is the fundamental method of treating chronic gonorrhea, and it is also the latest application in the current treatment of gonorrhea. Chunzai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has long been famous for treating gonorrhea and various gonococcal diseases. It employs many male and female doctors, and is fully equipped with electrotherapy equipment and gonorrhea drugs. No wonder its treatment results have an unexpected rapid effect.</p>
<h3>On Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— (Physician She 　Lei)</p>
<p>(1) The influence of the season It is said that quitting smoking should be done in a suitable season, with warm spring and autumn days being better, and hot summer and winter being unsuitable. However, this is unfounded talk. May I ask why summer and winter are not suitable for quitting smoking? What are the adverse effects? He will definitely not be able to answer. According to my personal experience, the season does not hinder quitting smoking. Only when infectious diseases are rampant, especially gastrointestinal diseases in the turn of summer and autumn, is it not suitable to quit. This is because the constitution of the quitter must be inferior to that of ordinary people, and nervous weakness and weak gastric resistance are phenomena unique to those with smoking habits. It is feared that it will easily cause the transmission of gastrointestinal diseases. As for the sunny, cloudy, cold, and warm weather, it does not hinder the process of quitting smoking.</p>
<p>(2) The relationship between diseases Opium can block people's diseases. Therefore, whether it is addiction due to illness or addiction due to play, a detailed examination must be done before quitting, and the cause of the disease must be removed. If there are no other subjective symptoms beforehand and it is not possible to quickly determine the factors of any disease, then during the quitting process, it is necessary to continue to explore in order to remove it early. If you want to remove smoking habits while the disease exists, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>(3) Age and gender 　The first priority of quitting smoking is to find a way to improve physical strength, and then gradually remove smoking habits. Older people generally have weaker physical strength than young people, and quitting is naturally more difficult. As for men and women quitting, there is no difference in difficulty. Except that women should not quit when they are about to give birth and attention should be paid to medication during menstruation, there are no other differences. This point can only be distinguished psychologically. Women are suspicious, fearful, and lack willpower, so from a proportional point of view, women are always inferior to men. (To be continued)</p>
<p>(Due to the crowding of the question and answer column in this issue, your manuscript could not be fully published. It will be continued in the medical lecture section on the 27th of this month. Apologies to the author, Yimin.)</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatment of Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— (Physician Jiang Guofan)</p>
<p>When this disease occurs, the stomach often experiences paroxysmal spasmodic pain, often fainting and tossing and turning in bed. However, it is relieved by pressing the painful area with the hand. Similar to this disease are biliary colic, but the pain is in the liver and is often accompanied by jaundice, and there are gallstones in the stool. Like intercostal neuralgia, although it is in the lower part, the pain follows the path of the nerve. Like stomach ulcers, the severe pain increases when pressed with the hand. Like abdominal muscle rheumatism, it is not paroxysmal spasmodic pain. There are various causes of this disease: such as neurasthenia, masturbation, spinal cord tuberculosis, stomach ulcers, stomach diseases, stomach catarrh, anemia, chlorosis, gout, intermittent fever, female reproductive organ diseases, alcohol, tobacco, tea, and excessively cold or spicy stimulants, etc., especially in women. However, it is usually caused by stomach catarrh, mental stimulation, and stimulants. When treating this disease, attention should first be paid to the cause. For those caused by stomach catarrh and mental stimulation, internal use of alkali is best. The best preparation among alkali is "Weibao." There is really no other drug besides that. This drug is one of the good medicines sold at Renji 　Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Each box sells for two yuan.</p>
<h3>Warts and Eczema</h3>
<p>— (Doctor Sun Zhi)</p>
<p>Although eczema and lichen planus are skin diseases, they are not easy to eradicate. The cause of lichen planus is said to be unpredictable in nature, appearing on the trunk, face, limbs, inner sides of the limbs, etc., as millet-sized yellowish-red or brown papules, sometimes occurring all over the body. The cause of eczema is generally related to internal heat, but the exact cause is still unclear. There are no inflammatory symptoms around the papules, and they cause burning and itching at night. If you try to puncture them with a needle, only watery fluid leaks out, sometimes forming scabs, pustules, or becoming eczematous. In the past, there were no corresponding drugs for the treatment of these two conditions, but since the advent of "Germ Destroyer," a thorough solution has been found. Germ Destroyer has unique functions for all skin diseases. Not only are these two conditions eliminated, but the medicine is sold at Ren Shou Pharmacy, No. 1, Lao De Xing Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, for one yuan per box.</p>

<h3>Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Doctor Feng Shanmu</p>
<p>Neurasthenia can be caused by hereditary factors related to mental and nervous diseases, or by poor nutrition due to excessive thinking caused by the pressures of life and competition. Therefore, some people call this an urban disease or a social disease. However, it is most commonly seen due to the bad habit of masturbation, excessive sexual activity, or excessive mental work during adolescence. Clinical examinations often reveal sexual neurasthenia such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>The common symptoms of this disease are aversion to employment, decreased memory and thinking ability, heavy head and dizziness, insomnia, and mental fatigue. Mental changes are also different from ordinary people, such as being easily angered, easily changing thoughts, suddenly being sad, suddenly being calm, suddenly being crazy, suddenly being suspicious, and so on. In addition, objective physical conditions include gradual weight loss, pale complexion, eyelid tremors, loss of appetite, and poor nutrition. For those with pronounced symptoms of genital sexual neurasthenia, in addition to the expected phenomena of sexual neurasthenia such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, their sexual excitement is far beyond that of ordinary people, and they are particularly prone to fatigue, even leading to atrophy of the genitals.</p>
<p>To treat this disease, one must first correct one's thoughts, eliminate desires, and it is better to change to a different environment for recuperation. All stimulants should be prohibited, even mild ones. Electrical therapy can be said to be an effective aid for this disease. In terms of drug therapy, endocrine and organic phosphorus are the most effective. The best preparation of this type of medicine is "Arolsen," sold by Ren Shou Pharmacy, which is the most effective.</p>

<h3>Reviving Student Movements</h3>
<p>— Lai Shi</p>
<p>Everyone is saying that the morale of the Chinese people has been too depressed in recent years. Even when our territory is being invaded and the nation is in danger, the people of the whole country, whether farmers, workers, or merchants, have not shown any reaction. This is truly a very strange phenomenon!</p>
<p>However, we believe that the Chinese people all have patriotic enthusiasm and will never lose their land or even their country without a sound of resistance. On the morning of the ninth of this month, students from various schools in Beiping felt the seriousness of the situation in North China, and driven by patriotic enthusiasm, they marched in teams to petition the authorities in North China, resolutely opposing the so-called "autonomy movement" and shouting slogans such as "Protect the security of North China" and "Maintain national rights." This not only effectively responded to the rebellious acts of the traitors who fabricated public opinion and plotted "autonomy," but also vented anger for the people of the whole country who had difficulty speaking out, showing that the patriotic enthusiasm of our people has not diminished. The "Shen Bao" editorial on the 11th pointed out that "Beiping students represent the people of the whole country and speak the truth," which is a correct understanding of this patriotic movement of Beiping students.</p>
<p>The patriotic movement of Beiping students has only been going on for a few days, but it has already aroused three noteworthy responses. First, the entire student body of Zhejiang University resolved to: 1. Send a telegram to respond to the demonstration movement of Beiping university students; 2. Send a telegram to all schools across the country to respond in unison; 3. Organize a propaganda team to promote opposition to "North China Autonomy" to the public. Second, Hangzhou students marched and demonstrated in the biting cold wind to oppose "North China Autonomy." Third, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram stating that the patriotic movement of Beiping students was a manifestation of "the people's hearts not being dead and the country still being able to be saved," and earnestly requested the authorities to instruct the military police not to oppress them. These three facts alone can fully demonstrate that our compatriots at home and abroad share the same power with Beiping students and are willing to work hard to "maintain national rights." If there are no objective obstacles, then I dare to believe that students and ordinary citizens across the country will inevitably follow the example of Beiping students, continue the spirit of the "May Thirtieth" and "May Fourth" movements, take on their responsibilities as citizens, and work hard to "maintain national rights" and save the nation from danger.</p>
<p>Naturally, students should make studying their primary duty, but when the country's land is being plundered and the people of the whole country are about to become slaves of a conquered nation, if young students with blood and knowledge are still sitting firmly in the classroom, not coming out to awaken the people and save the country together, then what is the use of studying? Mr. Cai Yuanpei said after the "May Fourth" movement: "Study without forgetting to save the country, save the country without forgetting to study." This statement is of particular significance at present. Moreover, young students, compared to the general public, of course understand national and ethnic issues first. If young students across the country can all rise up together to awaken the people of the whole country to save the country and take on their responsibilities, then the result will inevitably become a patriotic movement of the people of the whole country, and the power of the people of the whole country can be used to save the country. Therefore, we say that the revival of student movements is the prelude to the revival of the patriotic movement of the people of the whole country; and the great responsibility of students across the country at present can also be seen in general.</p>
<p>The revival of student movements and even the patriotic movements of the general public can of course demonstrate our national spirit and enhance our diplomatic power and spirit of resistance. For example, during the "May Fourth," "May Thirtieth," and Northern Expedition eras, due to the high morale of our people, powerful enemies dared not underestimate us, let alone make unreasonable demands on us to plunder our land; during the Northern Expedition era, our people even automatically recovered the Hankou Concession. On the contrary, before "September 18th" and after "January 28th," because the morale of our people was depressed, the situation was very different. Based on these facts and reasons, we therefore agree with the opinion of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce: the authorities should "telegraph the military police not to strengthen repression" of the patriotic movements of students and the general public.</p>
<p>The country is the people's country, and the government should be the people's government. In the current serious situation, the people should of course automatically rise up to assist the government and save the country together; although the government, due to diplomatic relations, is inconvenient to actively lead the people in their efforts to love the country, we always hope that the government will not restrict the spontaneous patriotic movements of students and the general public.</p>

<h3>"European Paradise"</h3>
<p>— Ji Chen</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence</p>
<p>If you want to talk about prosperity and modernity, then please go to Paris or London. But if you want to browse scenic spots, to please your mood, to relieve sorrow and dispel boredom, then please visit Switzerland. Here are the Alps, with snow all year round, many glaciers and waterfalls; there are calm lakes, beautiful rivers, and "quaint" and "civilized" cities; and this is what Europeans call the "European Paradise," the "World Park," and the "European Land of Peace."</p>
<p>Among the "European Paradise," the most famous place is of course Geneva at the exit of Lake Geneva. Here are the world-famous watches, as well as the headquarters of the League of Nations and the International Red Cross, so the Swiss often boast of being the "Capital of the World," but the capital of Switzerland itself is Bern. This city is 545 meters above sea level, and now has a population of about 119,000, which of course is nothing compared to general big cities, but its population density is higher than anywhere else, and anyone who comes here will feel that there are many people.</p>
<p>Bern is also known as the Bear City, because it uses the bear as its city symbol. Here are many historical sites, such as the spring water at the crossroads, the bear statue wearing armor on the spring water, the child-eater, and the goddess of justice, all of which still exist today. At the same time, on the other hand, there are of course also "civilized" cars and bicycles, and also</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>modernized buildings, which constitute the capital of the "European Paradise", a disharmonious landscape line that mixes "classical" and "modern". Standing on the banks of the Aare River, you can see the wonder of the natural river bend, its shape like a W. Contrasting with the beautiful mountains and rivers, there are also the high towers of churches, the memorial tower of the Universal Postal Union, parks and huge chambers, the historical museum and the memorial tower of the International Telecommunication Union in front of it; these further highlight the non-monotonicity of Bern's scenery.</p>
<p>The most beautiful scenery in Switzerland is Lake Lucerne, especially the city of Lucerne on the left bank of this lake. Lake Lucerne is also known as the Lake of the Four Cantons, and the Swiss Rhone River originates here. The city of Lucerne has mountain railways, and many people from all over the world come here to travel, so it can be said that there is an endless stream of people. Like other scenic spots, there are many historical sites and beautiful scenery. If you stand near the parking lot and look out, you can see the octagonal tower in the Rhone River and the ancient bridge on the river. This ancient bridge, like a long snake, lies diagonally on the river. It is a wooden bridge built in 1407; there is a small chapel here, famous for the "Dance of Death" painted by the 16th-century painter Casper Meglinger, as well as the patron saint, martyr statues and other historical sites.</p>
<p>Because Switzerland has beautiful natural scenery, many people from Europe and the United States come here to travel, especially in summer. At the same time, the Swiss also try their best to provide them with convenience in all aspects. For example, building mountain railways and tunnels to facilitate passengers to travel by car; such as opening hotels on isolated peaks to provide tourists with rest; such as opening hot spring baths and lakeside parks to increase their interest; in addition, such as the thoughtfulness of hostels and restaurants to general foreign tourists, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>As for Switzerland's international status, it is certainly not reduced in importance because it is a "European Paradise." As mentioned earlier, Geneva is the location of the League of Nations, and all the important issues of the European powers must be resolved here. Therefore, from the diplomatic tricks played by the powers here, the development and changes of the European and even the world situation can be seen; in addition, Lausanne and Locarno are also the locations where the powers have convened important conferences and signed important agreements in recent years. Of course, the reason why Switzerland has become such a country is partly due to its terrain, but on the other hand, its political system and its relationship with the powers are also one of its main reasons. Because it implements a federal republic system, people here have more freedom of action, so political exiles from various countries in the past came to Switzerland to take refuge, and important negotiations from various countries also came here to be carried out; more importantly, it is because it is a permanently neutral country recognized by all countries, so the League of Nations and various important international institutions are located within its borders, and many important international conferences are also held here. However, in recent years, due to the development of international contradictions, even Switzerland is not very free, and it is obvious that some exiled politicians cannot settle down in Switzerland at present.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the tense international situation, the heads of various countries have constantly visited Switzerland, playing tricks and scheming against each other here, which has made the "European Paradise" also full of gunpowder and full of the horror of war. The so-called happy scene has long become a formality, although the Alps are still showing their white heads, and Lake Lucerne is still so beautiful.</p>
<p>Philosophy Lecture</p>
<h3>On Experience</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>We often hear people say, "So-and-so is very experienced" or "So-and-so is rich in experience." It seems that having experience is a good thing. Indeed, the only way we come to know external things and acquire knowledge is through experience. We understand the inevitable laws of the development of objective things outside of our ideas, and from this, we know how to adapt to objective developments in practice, guiding our actions to be correct and effective. This too relies on experience, and therefore experience is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>However, what is the essence of experience? How can one be considered a true empiricist? Furthermore, how does one experience external things? Discussing these questions philosophically is not as simple as we usually imagine. Therefore, in the history of philosophy, many philosophers have expressed differing opinions on these two words, even leading to the emergence of many philosophical schools.</p>
<p>All philosophers who are proponents of innate ideas or a priori concepts steadfastly oppose empiricism. They believe that experience is completely useless because they think that one cannot gain any knowledge through the senses, nor can one obtain any truth. They believe that there is no such thing as external reality, and that only our mind and intangible self-spirit are the only realities. Sensory appearances are not the result of external real objects acting upon us, nor are they produced by the reflection of external things, but rather are illusions of our minds, entirely self-generated colors or concepts of our psychology. A table is not a real, existing table outside of us; the table exists only in our minds or in the mind of God, as Berkeley said. Naturally, this philosophy that completely opposes empiricism is a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy. They never consider that if the representations of external things reflected in the mind are all illusions, and if external things themselves do not exist at all, then aren't the philosophers' own bodies also a type of everything in the universe? Even if they seem false to others, do they not still believe in their own bodily existence? If they say that their own body is just an illusion, without substance, then how can their minds exist? According to Descartes, "I think, therefore I am." Upon closer examination, the meaning of his words already proves his theory to be inaccurate. For if one can think, then there must be an "I" that exists. Isn't it that I exist, therefore I can think? Furthermore, I am an external object just like other external objects. Since I can experience the existence of myself, this external object, through thought, isn't it natural that we can also experience the existence of other external objects? Therefore, this philosophy that absolutely denies the possibility of experience is an absolute idealist philosophy, and it is fundamentally incorrect.</p>
<p>However, saying that philosophies opposing empiricism are wrong and idealistic does not mean that any philosophy that advocates empiricism is completely correct and non-idealistic. In fact, within empiricism, there are also idealistic and incorrect philosophical schools. Because within it, there are pure empiricism, dualistic empiricism, and materialistic empiricism, all of which should be distinguished.</p>
<p>Kant is a transcendentalist philosopher. He regards time and space as a priori, innate forms. He also believes that there are a priori ideas and laws within pure reason, which can only be attained through one's own understanding. However, Kant does not completely deny experience. He argues that knowledge is obtained through the paths of sensation and experience, and that experience even has necessity and causal laws. Knowledge also arises from the effects of objective things on our nature. However, he believes that the knowledge gained solely through sensory experience is not true knowledge. Therefore, within the scope of experience, external things are unknowable. To reach external things and gain true knowledge, one must go through the activity of understanding, through the forms and laws of thought of the a priori ideas existing in pure reason. In this way, Kant recognizes the existence of things-in-themselves, acknowledges the certain role of experience and its necessary causality, but on the other hand, he also believes that things-in-themselves are unknowable, cannot be obtained through experience, and that beyond experience reflecting the external world, there are still a priori ideas and forms and laws of thought. Therefore, Kant has one foot on the boat of materialism and the other foot on the boat of idealistic mysticism, becoming a dualistic philosopher. Precisely for this reason, the materialists on the left oppose him, and the idealists on the right, such as Schulze and Fichte, also oppose him. Of course, in our view, his fault lies not in acknowledging the possibility of things-in-themselves and experience, and using them as sources of knowledge, but in his doctrine of the unknowability of things-in-themselves and the a priorism of thought and its laws. Because if things-in-themselves are completely unknowable, then what are we experiencing? If the laws of the external world are not reflected through experience to form the laws of thought and its forms, then where do the a priori laws come from? How can the understanding create them out of thin air? This is where his incompleteness and mysteriousness lie.</p>
<p>As for the sensationalists of the Mach school, they outwardly wave the banner of empiricism, but in reality, they are even more regressive idealists than Kant's dualism. Because although they verbally say that all knowledge comes from experience, and that the formation of our thoughts and ideas does not have a pre-existing mind, they say that what forms our ideas or concepts is neither the mind nor things, but only a synthesis of some sensory elements. Like absolute idealists, they do not acknowledge the reality of the external world, not even Kant's premise that things-in-themselves exist. Naturally, even if they sometimes take a step forward and acknowledge the existence of external things, they still cannot go beyond Hume's skepticism and believe that things-in-themselves are unknowable, and of course, they can only become advocates of the unknowability of things-in-themselves like Kant.</p>
<p>In this way, within the camp of empiricism, there are completely different philosophical systems regarding how to understand experience itself and how to use the method of experience to understand the world. The pure empiricists' method of using experience to understand the world always confines experience within the subjective idealistic circle, preventing it from reaching the other shore of things. Experience is not experiencing the world outside of experience, but experience is just the separation and combination of subjective psychological elements. In their hands, experience is not a method of understanding the external world, the external world is not the end point of experience, but experience takes itself as the ultimate and end point. What can such empiricists experience? I think it is clear without rebuttal. Because without external things, there is no object of knowledge and experience; if external things are unknowable, then knowledge and experience have no use; if there is no contact with the external world at all, then the so-called experience is just the subjective spirit imagining everything and fabricating everything. What kind of experience of the external world is that?</p>
<p>The correct philosophy is indeed a philosophy of the essence of empiricism, but the essence of experience that it recognizes is that the human spirit is experiencing the external world, but not just experiencing itself. Because there can be no experience unless external things act on our sensory organs to produce sensations. Experience is the interaction of things and self. Without the action of things, there can be no empty spiritual experience. To talk about experience, there must be the existence of external things. The possibility of experience also proves that external things are actually existent. Furthermore, experience is a process of knowing external things. Although the effectiveness of experience varies due to the level of human culture and the thinking methods used, one cannot say that external things are unknowable. Because if external things are unknowable, then one cannot talk about experience. Experience is a method and path of knowledge. What we call using experience is relying on this path and method to reach the external world, not taking experience as the purpose or end. Therefore, we cannot regard experience as a sacred object, thinking that experience itself can satisfy everything, and even that everything is hidden only within experience itself and does not exist in the world outside of experience. This is the correct, new philosophy of empiricism.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of British Industry</h3>
<p>— Yuan Jun</p>
<p>Many people compare England to a "gentlemanly" nation. From the outside, it is indeed elegant and luxurious. Even the emerging United States of America does not have its suave and generosity. However, this gentleman has also shown some signs of decline in recent years. Can he still maintain his youth and vibrancy? This is indeed a matter of concern for us today.</p>
<p>In recent years, England's economic position has been almost constantly declining, and its production volume has been decreasing month by month. The price of goods has been falling year after year to an uncontrollable extent. The number of unemployed people is increasing. According to official statistics, the number of unemployed people has increased by 300,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, England is clearly making a final struggle. Its industry is undergoing profound changes, namely the rationalization of all industries, the formation of monopolistic organizations, and the reconstruction of the competitiveness of British industry in the world market. This process has encountered great difficulties in England, which have been overcome through a strong struggle. Some industrial sectors, especially new industries, have already occupied a successful position in the world market. England currently ranks first in the world in the export of electrical products. Many people say that British industrial capitalists have given up hope of reviving British industry, but this is a mistake. This can be seen from the increase in the total amount of investment in industry.</p>
<p>In individual sectors, the decline is most severe in the coal industry. However, from the capitalists' point of view, it has made significant progress compared to previous years. The production of copper and iron is stagnating, and domestic consumption is not growing.</p>
<p>According to reports, the business trends of new industries such as chemicals, electrical appliances, automobiles, and films are very good.</p>
<p>Here, we should describe the general situation of the transformation movement in British industry. The direction of the so-called transformation movement does not go beyond two paths: one is monopolistic organization, and the other is wage reduction. The difficulty of British monopolistic organizations is clearly a special method of supporting industrial enterprises with borrowed capital, because the interest on this capital becomes a burden on the company first. They still hope for continued high profits, but they are now undergoing serious sacrifices in the merger.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on the transitional capitalist viewpoint of many enterprises, monopolistic organizations are encountering great difficulties, although these difficulties are still easy to overcome. The formation of large trusts is most noteworthy in the merger of South Wales coal mines.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting thing, that is, in the centralized management of coal mines, it has aroused the struggle against private "royal properties." The Labor Party advocates nationalizing "royal properties," and capitalists quite agree with this proposal, in order to facilitate their private plans for absolute monopoly.</p>
<p>The same phenomenon exists in the cotton textile industry.</p>
<p>From the capitalist point of view, the greatest hope for the general promotion of England's economic position is the trend of the working class cooperating for "industrial peace." The basis of this plan was established at the Mond-Turner Conference. The main purpose of this meeting is "class coordination."</p>
<p>The result of this new spirit in industry is the fact that in the first seven months, the wages of 1.1 million workers were reduced. Since then, the wages of railway workers have been reduced by an average of 2.5 percent, so the railway company can save up to 3 million pounds from workers every year.</p>
<p>The strength of British trade unions is greatly unsatisfactory to the laboring masses due to the increase in the number of unemployed people. The number of miners in employment has decreased from 958,000 to 626,000. This unemployment situation, coupled with the capitalists' forced reduction of wages, makes trade union leaders fear the arrival of any struggle crisis.</p>
<p>As for the British government's measures to relieve trade, they are nothing more than reducing local taxes and reducing railway transportation fees for coal and iron exports. Naturally, this will not immediately reverse the crisis of the old industry, so the government has the necessity of adopting a protection policy.</p>
<p>Baldwin said: "We have taken on this guarantee and will carry it through to the end, that is, we will never adopt protection or similar policies for food. Naturally, security is still the party's policy, and based on experience, it may be considerably simplified in form." This is no different from a declaration of this policy.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>(1) The Forgetfulness of Celebrities</p>
<p>Painlevé was a famous mathematician and served as the Prime Minister of France three times. Under normal circumstances, such a person's brain should be very clear, but he was confused, even forgetting that his own car was parked at the door, and instead calling a streetcar to go out. Later, he went to the street to buy something and came back. The driver asked him for the house number, but he mistakenly said the telephone number, causing the driver to search hard for a long time, while he was sleeping in the car.</p>
<p>Once, he was talking to a good friend, but when the time was almost up, he had to go out for a while, so he nailed a note on the door, writing: "Painlevé will be back in ten minutes, please wait a while." Later, he came back from outside and saw the note on the door saying that Painlevé was not at home, so he sat on the steps waiting. When his friend came out and asked him why he was sitting at the door, he suddenly remembered that he was Painlevé himself.</p>
<p>The British chemist and electrician Faraday also had a terrible memory. Once, the King summoned him, but he forgot. Later, after thinking hard for a long time, he went to the wrong place, to a Duke's house.</p>

<p>Once, a friend sent someone to ask him to talk, and he agreed to go right away. After the person left, he immediately put on his coat and came out, but before he had walked more than ten steps, he forgot about his appointment with his friend, and said to himself: "What am I doing going out for a walk so late?" So he walked back.</p>
<p>He was even more comical in the laboratory. He often held something in his hand, but still searched everywhere for it. After searching hard for a long time and still not finding it, he would get angry and throw the thing in his hand away, running to the street to buy it. As a result, he always forgot the name of what he wanted to buy halfway, and walked back, only to see the thing he wanted.</p>
<p>The scientist Newton was even more famous for being muddleheaded. Once, a friend came to visit him at his house, so he ran to get wine for the guest. Who knew that this trip would take two hours? He forgot about the wine and forgot about the guest. His friend waited in the living room until he couldn't bear it anymore, and then ran everywhere to look for him, only to find that he was experimenting in the laboratory as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Once, his close friend Stukeley came to find him. At this time, Newton was working in the laboratory, so Stukeley went to his bedroom and sat down. Seeing a plate of steamed chicken on the table, which was his lunch, Stukeley ate it without hesitation. When Newton ran over and saw that the steamed chicken was gone, he looked at Stukeley in surprise and said: "My memory is really bad. I thought I hadn't eaten, but it turns out I had already eaten."</p>
<p>Once again, on a winter night, Newton was reading a book next to the stove. The fire in the stove was burning very red. He felt too hot, so he added a lot of ash to reduce the heat, but it was still unbearably hot. So he called the servant and instructed him: "It's too hot next to this stove. Help me move it further away."</p>
<p>The servant listened to his words and replied strangely: "Master, there is no way to move the stove. It's better if you move the chair further away, wouldn't that be less hot?"</p>
<p>Newton thought for a while and suddenly realized: "That's right, how did I not think of that?"</p>
<p>The second time, he was reading a book next to the stove again, and a pot was on the stove, boiling water. The servant was preparing his dinner, but he instructed the servant: "Just bring a few eggs. I'll cook them myself when I want to eat. You can go!"</p>
<p>The servant brought the eggs and put them on the table, and then left. When Newton finished reading a paragraph, he felt a little hungry, so he put the eggs into the pot and continued reading.</p>
<p>When he finished reading the book, he thought about eating the eggs. But when he looked up, the eggs were still on the table, untouched. When he looked into the pot again, he found that what was cooking was a pocket watch that he had taken off his body.</p>
<p>(2) Grand Statements of Great Men</p>
<p>In the fourth century BC, the Greek monarch Alexander the Great conquered the East and West, opening up tens of thousands of miles of land. Almost all the land in the world came under his control, but his heart was still not satisfied. After he conquered Egypt, he asked his entourage: "What is west of Egypt?"</p>
<p>"The Sahara Desert, all the way to the end of the earth, where no plants grow."</p>
<p>So he led his troops back to Asia, plundering various parts of Central Asia, and then crossed the Caspian Sea, climbing the snow-capped mountains overlooking the world, pointing to a desolate area in the north and asking: "What is beyond that place?"</p>
<p>"Over there are all frozen rivers, stretching endlessly to the edge of the earth. Other than ice and snow, there is nothing else."</p>
<p>He then led his troops southward, reaching India, and all the cities were captured by him one by one. Finally, he arrived at the Ganges River and asked his entourage: "What is east of this place?"</p>
<p>"From this place to the end of the world are dense trees, strange beasts all over the mountains and plains, and there is no road to walk."</p>
<p>Hearing these disappointing words, he was so angry that he had no choice but to order the construction of a large number of ships, and sailed westward into the sea, and asked: "What is on the other side of the water?"</p>
<p>"It's all a vast ocean, connected to the edge of the earth, with no human traces."</p>
<p>Before the person answering could finish speaking, Alexander burst out laughing and said: "The world that can be reached by human traces, regardless of East, West, South, or North, is already all mine, and there is nothing more to conquer. However, I didn't expect the world to be so small, and it couldn't withstand my several conquests!"</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, there was another arrogant monster, and that was the Roman Emperor Caesar. During his reign in Rome, he also conquered the East and West like Alexander, opening up tens of thousands of miles of land. In world history, he can also be considered a rare great man.</p>
<p>Once, he was crossing the strait by boat, and encountered a storm on the way. For a time, huge waves surged in the sea, and it seemed that the boat might sink at any moment. The captain was so frightened that his face turned pale, and he had to kneel down and look at the sky, saying: "Everything is over, everything is over!"</p>
<p>Seeing the captain's expression, he couldn't help but find it funny, but he still straightened his face and pulled the captain up, telling him: "What are you afraid of? With Caesar here, the ship cannot sink!"</p>

<h3>Bringing Up the Account Book (7)</h3>
<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>The old man rolled up his eyes and stared at me blankly, as if he had lost his soul, or like a dying patient. This pitiful appearance suddenly reminded me of the scene when my father was extorted by the anti-smoking committee that year. I couldn't help but feel a chill all over my body, and my emotions softened a bit. But then I thought: A kindhearted person is not suitable for living in the current society. Indeed, who among the high officials and the wealthy does not have a hard heart? My hope is to sit on the same bench as the high officials and shake hands and greet the rich. Then I have to make money. To make money, I have to throw compassion into the garbage dump. With this in mind, poisonous blood swelled all over me. Looking at the old man, I felt annoyed and hateful: his stingy appearance became an obstacle on my path to promotion. If I want to achieve my desires, I must first use the old man, skin him, draw his tendons, and even boil his bones into oil. So I straightened my chest and spoke in a stern tone: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Humorous Anecdotes of Dr. Li Amao: A Record of His Defeat in Love</h3>
<p>Dr. Li Amao (Xu Zhuodai) had a slight conflict with his beloved daughter, Miss Xu Qi, due to differing opinions on her marriage. Many people know about this, but what they probably don't know is that Dr. Li Amao had, not long ago, been a defeated general in the battlefield of love, playing the role of a clown in a love comedy.</p>
<p>Dr. Li's love rivals were numerous, including Cang Yinqiu, Ying Yin, and Lei Mengna. However, his main target of attack was Yin Mingzhu.</p>
<p>At one point (when Dr. Li was a manager in a theater, and Yin Mingzhu and others were dance stars there), he often took Yin Mingzhu out to buy things like clothes and accessories, showering her with gifts every day. One day, he single-handedly created an opportunity and invited Yin Mingzhu out for an evening outing, and she actually agreed. This made the fat, heavy-headed man, whose eyes blinked incessantly, and who was even more intriguing than Hardy, overjoyed. He even refused an appointment with his own wife. Unexpectedly, Yin Mingzhu suddenly stood him up that evening and went out to have fun with the theater owner. This infuriated Dr. Li so much that his eyes blinked non-stop as if they were hypnotized.</p>
<p>Similar jokes like this happened countless times. Once, he was loudly speaking ill of Yin Mingzhu in front of the boss (unaware that her broken appointment was because of the boss), not realizing that Yin Mingzhu was standing behind him, smiling gleefully. This made him extremely embarrassed, and his eyes blinked even more exaggeratedly out of awkwardness. In the blink of an eye, Yin Mingzhu and the boss walked out together, arm in arm, looking triumphant. … In short, he completely played the role of a clown in a love comedy.</p>
<p>The above, although seemingly unfounded, is based on verified facts. However, the performance of that humorous story was on the silver screen—in the Shanghai Film Company's musical film "Peach Blossom Dream," directed by Bu Wancang.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for Star Motion Picture Company's Sound Stage</h3>
<p>Since moving to its new location at Fenglin Bridge, the Star Motion Picture Company has been actively preparing to increase production, aiming to simultaneously advance in both quantity and quality to forge a path for Chinese cinema. To simultaneously advance in both quantity and quality, complete tools are necessary. Based on this premise, the Star Company, under meticulous planning, completed a large-scale plan to build a sound stage. Furthermore, this morning (December 15th) at 10:00 AM, a grand groundbreaking ceremony was held. It is expected that when the spirit of spring descends upon the world next year, this magnificent and perfectly equipped sound stage will be completed. At that time, Star's productions will naturally align with its pre-determined plans, which is certainly to be expected.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Someone said: "There are many directors in the Chinese film industry who are diplomatic talents whose potential is unrealized." In reality, if these treasures were truly asked to engage in diplomacy, they would probably be of the same ilk as Yin Rugeng.</p>
<p>Kaimaila [Camera] states: "After seeing 'Tian Lun' [Heavenly Ethics], I am delighted with the rapid progress in Luo Mingyou's directing techniques compared to his debut work, 'Guo Feng' [National Customs]. The third film will certainly be even more impressive, but I wonder who he will co-direct it with?"</p>
<p>According to another friend who saw "Tian Lun," "'Tian Lun' compared to 'Guo Feng' not only shows rapid progress, but also has a rather different style. Seeing this, Premier Luo Mingyou's style seems similar to Fei Mu's. The third film should naturally be best co-directed with Fei Mu. Otherwise, I fear the 'style' will change again."</p>
<p>Zhou Jianyun recently went to Beijing, reportedly for the matter of the flood relief entertainment fair.</p>
<p>It is rumored that in Wu Cun's "Spring Flowers," there is a play within a play called "Love Song Not Intended." What are Jia Gong's thoughts upon hearing this?</p>
<p>The disaster relief lottery bonds offer both disaster relief and the hope of getting rich, achieving two benefits at once. Now, clever merchants have risen up to imitate this, with what is called "Mutual Aid Ten Thousand Profit Bonds," and they are beautifully called "referral fees."</p>
