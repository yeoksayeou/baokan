<h3>時評紡織業困難與原棉課税問題</h3>
<p>自報載某中委倡議救全國紗廠以來。於是紡織業如何困難之呼撀又復甚囂塵上。當此商業習慣正逢一年總结算之時期。國内一二厰家資力稍嫌脆弱者。固因市面不景氣之影響。而陷於停業整理之狀態即平日實力較强之紗厰似亦不免有羣感紗賤花貴之苦痛益以年來國民經濟之衰落。遂使困難日深全國紡織業在此情勢之下。究將如何渡過。誠値得吾人予以深切之考慮者也。</p>
<p>吾人默察日來各方救濟紗業之説似其目光皆集中於紗賤花貴之一黠。以爲非减輕原棉價値（即原料成本）不爲功推是説之用意殆以標紗價格日低降至一百八十餘元。而原棉價格則因居奇操緃之故竟日形昻貴因是每件紗之成本超過紗價甚鉅爲壓低棉價起見乃有减低目前原棉進口關税之説言之固覺成理然就吾所知。棉貴既非紗業之根本困難而减低原棉進口關税能否即收棉賤之效。尤不能令人無疑也。　　我國號稱以農立國雖棉產不能完全给。然在年來全國復與農村之口</p>
<p>號下。種棉事業。似已爲銀行業主要農業之投資。棉產之漸進於豊收。固爲極顯明之利益。不能關非一大佳事。蓋以其復興農村以後應有之現象也。且尤有不可忽視者。自一九三四年七月間現行税則公布以來原棉進口税率爲每百公徵五金單位。較原訂税則徵三點五金單位者增重逹百分之四十三。當時國人莫不以爲國内消用外棉最多之外厰如日商者。必受甚大之打轚。華厰於此正可作有利之競爭。日商各厰對於原棉加税所以有反對之表示也此事雖已過去。然至今日。我國人若爲一時利益。爲欲壓低國棉之故。而主張增進外棉之進口。恐所得结局。徒爲外商所竊笑。如云棉花價格。可以由是壓低。則殊未必。須知目前棉價之趨於昂贵貴。乃因美國昨年大旱影響。完全基於國際市塲供求變動之原則。非區區一國税則所能操縱於其間也。</p>
<p>抑吾人於今日紗厰根本困難所在。有不能不予以充分之認識者。即不外生產效率之落後與外資勢力之壓迫。二者是也。前者屬於生產成本問題。而後者則爲一般所謂獨立國家之市塲保護政策。尤不能忽視。果欲於此世界競爭日激之時。從事國内紡織業之振發。舍此根本上之救濟方法外。恐未必别有他種特殊有效之策劃。若徒知從枝節問題上解决。將不特有出爾反爾之嫌。抑亦非國人所以謀自救之本意也。</p>

<h3>國聯行政院會展期薩爾問題生波折</h3>
<p>德要求規定移交日期</p>
<p>國聯進退維谷尋覓妥協案</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據消息靈通者觀察、英法要求將薩爾劃爲非武裝之萊茵區之一部、致使國聯行政院預定今日將薩爾移交德國之會議、展期舉行、行政院方面宣布、關於薩爾之许多問題统期於本届會議解决、而不願將詳細辨法留交委員會處理、德國方面對此新發展之反響如何、希特勒之代表並無隻字表示、微聞仼何稽延、將使德意志全國發生惡感、蓋德國政府與人民一致堅求薩爾即行歸還祖國也、况德國之要求在投票之前即已堅决、今茲投票結果已經揭暁、其中贊成歸德國竟佔百分之九十强鉅數、則失地歸還之無可遲貳、更不待論矣、是以英法之要求、將國聯行政院處於進退維谷之境、蓋國聯方面主張即行解决薩爾問題、而不願橫生枝節也、惟國聯中兩强既有此要求、行政院唯有英法之馬首是瞻而已、薩爾問題之最後解决既須稽延時日、則各國又須作會外之接洽、以期獲得四面圓通之妥恊案云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院今日午後舉行重要會議、考慮薩爾公民投票委員會之報吿書、並展緩作關於以薩爾交還德國之决議、日内瓦人士對於臨時展緩原因、紛加猜測、某某數界謂此舉與今晨政界所表示交還薩爾恊定應力求寛大之願望有關、或今於技術上之佈置已發生頓挫云、惟此項展緩、爲時不久、聞行政院明日或尙將集議、同時據柏林消息、德政府已向國聯提出嚴厲要求、请定期交還薩爾、並撤退駐薩爾之國際軍隊云、惟據官塲聲稱、日内瓦德總領事克鲁魯爾今日會唔阿洛錫男爵時、並未提出要求、但會切實聲明、今宜儘早交還薩爾、俾德政府可於一月之内接管該地、德國現覺絶無理由延緩交還、德國現處於堅持其權利、而不必請任何人讓步之地位云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>續電、據負責方面消息、行政院會議對交還薩爾事展緩議决之原因、乃由法國提出薩爾解除軍備問題所致、蓋按照凡爾賽和約第四十二至四十四條、萊因河左岸之德國土地全須解除軍備、法國現要求拆毁與用兵有關之鐵路、並供運兵火車裝卸之各項設備等事、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英人方面宣稱、即使對廢止凡爾賽和約中之軍事條文、薩爾必須爲不駐兵區域云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）各方面關於薩爾問題、現正在國聯會行政院之外進行談話、俾得覓獲法德兩國皆可滿意之解决辦法、法德兩國意見參差之點、着重在薩爾區域解除武裝一事、法國方面以爲凡爾賽和約、規定萊茵河左岸撤廢武裝區域、當包括薩爾在内、而在公民投票决定薩爾命運之前、此一問題、實無提出之必要、但在德國方面、則以爲公民投票德國勝利之後、凡爾賽和約所載之軍事條欵、關於薩爾區域一層、自無繼續存在之理由、一般人以爲此層、仍可順利解决、各國外交談話、現在賡續進行中、今晨蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫、會與波蘭外長柏克商談東歐互助公約問題、柏克仍在病中、法國外長頼伐爾將於午後訪問柏克、雙方所討論者不外法國與波蘭全部關係東歐公約、及意法兩國羅馬恊定各項問題、一般人對於此等事極感興趣、此外南斯拉夫總理兼外長葉夫的區行將來此、英國西門外相亦將重返此間、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府現主張從速决定國聯薩爾管理委員會以薩爾行政移交德國當局之時期、並主張從速决定撤退國際警備軍、英政府之意見、將由外相西門在國聯行政院會議中發表、西門明日或星期五日可啓程赴日内瓦、薩爾與德國各處間現存在之關卡、行將撤除、現料薩爾與法國間、將設同樣之關卡、且將商定辦法、使薩　爾人民能將佛郎易爲德幣、倫敦消息靈通各界之意、凡爾赛賽和約中關於德國解除武裝之條文、今當然將施於薩爾、因薩爾已後爲德國土地之一部分也、法國現信此次投票之結果、將鞏固希特勒在國内之地位、大約尙將增重外交事務之毅力、恐奥國國社黨將因此復圖　蠢動、時報謂大局現宜極審愼應付之、並謂法英意三國當恊同對付、希特勒化之德國、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院定於今日下午四時先舉行秘密會議、後即開正式會議、正式聰取薩爾投票結果、及薩爾投票委員會主席維德之報告、國聯主席魯希悌然後請阿樂西致辭、阿樂西將提議即請薩爾區全部歸還德國、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>選票運抵日内瓦</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）薩爾區域公民投票委員會全體人員携带選票數十箱、昨日由薩爾白魯根城乘專車啟程、業於本日午後行抵此間、國聯會高級人員以及國際報界代表皆往歡迎、並由大隊警察出發、加以保護、此項選票如何銷毁、當俟行政院决定、至於復核選票一層、則一般人以爲贊成歸還德國者既佔如此多數、殊無復核之必要云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>薩爾恢復常態</h3>
<p>（薩爾白魯克根、此間景象業已恢復常態、但到處仍見旗幟飄揚、公民投票委員會及薩爾行政委員會辦公地點、至爲安靜、與數日前前熱閙狀態適相對照、行政委員會主席諾克斯業於今晨乘汽車前往日内瓦、向國聯會行政院明薩爾區域、主張移轉時期愈早愈妙、緣在薩爾居民視之、行政委員會殆已因公民投票之結果而喪威槿、萬一治安感受威脅、則行政委員會殊難採取嚴重之决議也、一般人以爲諾克斯將主張、主權移交不於三月十五日至四月一日間、而於三月一日行之支、目前反國社主義派薩爾人移殖運動繼續進行、每日向法國領事館要求保護者、輙有千人左右、贊成維持現狀派各報現已停止出版、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德人一夜狂歡</h3>
<p>提燈遊行袤長逹數哩</p>
<p>黨國歌薩爾歌相應和喪服舁棺嘲弄現狀</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根、此次投票、國社黨獲根大之多數、德國發薩爾均大爲歡忭、薩爾各街道昨夜均張燈結綵、男婦兒童數萬人、高擎中國燈籠、游行於市、長可數哩、觀中竚觀者如堵、當提燈會過時、萬聲歡呼、其狀若狂、此外並有軍樂及其他音樂隊數十、集於道中、奏愛國進行曲、德國國歌·黨歌·薩爾歌、似示歡欣「萬歲」之呼聲、東起西應、不絶於耳、有青年一團、衣喪服、戴高冠、舁一棺、上書「局先生殰」葬、周游於市、羣衆見者、均狂笑歡呼、以花圏一枚、上書「君已勝利矣」數字、置於預料反希特勒派必勝之勞工報館前、諸於此類之幽默事件、紀不勝紀、所幸受者均安忍之、毫未發生事端、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>白魯根　薩爾投票結果已揭暁、國社黨所謂之「本世紀慶祝節」、即於晚間舉行、民衆持火炬游行、其熱烈之狀、匪言可喻、入晚六時、绵延不絕之民衆、即排隊行者、當有二十萬人之多、就觀察所得謂其確逹此數、當非過甚之詞、蓋羣衆行過歴三小時、綿亘不絕、衝鋒隊有機器脚踏車及連旁坐之機器脚踏車、爲之前導、皆蔽之以卍字旗幟、又有荷假人以行者、用以代表維持現狀派、則有羣衆拍掌歡呼以嘲弄之、軍樂隊則奏薩爾歌、間之以德國國歌、及國社黨黨歌、及暮色茫之際、全城電炬照耀、家家房屋幾皆有一巨大之希特勒像、高逹一公尺、惟國社黨熱烈情绪緒、頃刻即消淡、蓋至晚間十時、大多數參加慶祝者、以一日奔波勞頓疲乏、即均悄然歸去矣、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>海外僑民慶勝利</h3>
<p>（青島）本市德僑十六日懸旗慶祝薩爾投票勝利、（十六日專電）</p>
<p>阿根廷京城、政府頃許此間德僑、高懸德國國旗、以慶祝薩爾區域歸還德國之舉、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國全國舉行大規模示威、慶祝薩爾投票之勝利、宣傳部長戈爾培在柏林演説、詆斥凡爾賽條約、謂「既無意義復背自然」對於薩爾行政委員會亦加斥責、最後並向薩爾社會黨領袖樸朗建議、謂不如掘一墳穴、將德國旅外亡命之徒盡埋其中云、結語則謂「德國領土今乃完整無缺、吾人其團結以向前程猛進歟」云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>反對派安全堪虞</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根、在此永不可忘之歡樂聲中、有多人悄然束裝、而注意火車開行時刻表、若輩皆爲反對希特勒主義之薩爾人、今恐處希特勒治制之下、終必遭禍、故作遷地爲良之計、聞至少有社會黨共產黨著名人物亦六七人、已過邊界、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　　至目前爲止、各處僅有若干輕微事端、均無關重要、例如社會黨黨部遭德國陣綫團員包圍、意欲攻入黨部、當局乃將該黨部封閉、以避免衝突、國社黨員屢次侵入平民家宅、有數處地方、警察自動放棄崗位、改由衣制服之國社黨員站崗、（十五日來瓦斯電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　公民投票結果揭暁後、當局即採取防範措置、令反對國社黨各機關内之人員一律退出、因此「民聲報」與「勞工幸福團」及其他反希特勒派之大本營、均已瓦解、似將歸於消滅、當反對國社黨各機關瓦解時、並未發生越軌行動、此或因懼國際警察之故、但維持現狀派投票結果、既遭失敗、而個人安全、又復可慮、亦可謂禍不單行矣、且各國際機關、於公民投票揭暁後、似以爲任務業已完畢、例如天主敎反希特勒派領袖霍夫曼、因恐生命危險、已請求薩爾警務督察長英人漢纳西上尉加以保護、竟無效果、不得已乃另求他人保護、直至昨夜離薩爾區域時爲止、此外有法國人十五家、因受國社黨威嚇、被迫離家屋、面在法國所管轄之礦厰周圍、暫時躱避、有此種種事故、反國社黨方面人土、士、昨晚期望國聯會通知各國際權關、告以彼等現尙負維持薩爾地方秩序之責、但國社黨中最有聲望之若干領袖、則向哈瓦斯社代表宣佈、該黨擬在薩爾區域繼續採取之政策、現表緩和之傾向、此項政策、可分以下四點、（一）國社黨對於薩爾問題之勝利、不至損害法德兩國關係、蓋薩爾問題解决後、法德間不復有領土問題存在也、（二）關於反國社黨之首領、則國社黨認爲此等當自知其所處地位、甚爲困難、（三）國社黨擬以勸導方法、説服反對黨徒、（四）就宗敎觀點、則此次薩爾投票結果、對於德國與羅馬敎廷間、可提供若干有關係之談判要素、蓋德國天主敎徒深知德國與敎廷有更密切合作之可能、今薩爾天主敎徒既表示贊成希特勒、則可使德國天主敎徒更受激厲云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>市街改名誌紀念</h3>
<p>（柏林）本市當局宣布、史特萊斯曼街改名爲「薩爾街」所以紀念一月十三日、查此通衢通兩車站、火車可自該站直逹薩爾、故特選定此街爲薩爾街、以示勝利而誌不忘、並由柏林市長親自舉行更名典禮、（十五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>各國之表示</h3>
<p>意官塲滿意</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利官塲方面對於薩爾民衆歸附祖國之熱忱、一致表示公開之滿意、且贊成合併於德國之票數既如是之多、則完全顯明之局面已經造成、决無異議矣、國聯對於該問題之處置、亦得一定遵循之道、無庸多所顧慮矣、（十五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>奥人民歡欣</h3>
<p>（維也納）薩爾民衆投票之結果、奥國人民聞之、凡有國家思想者、俱爲之歡欣歌舞、惟政府當局則對於民情之表示、力爲防範、並在維也納禁止報紙對於此事之刋行號外、或舉行示威集會、但外省各大城接得投票結果之消息後、人民不覺自動集合於各街道、狂呼德國萬歲、薩爾萬歲等口號、以資慶祝云、午後各報即將薩爾柏林及日内瓦等地傳來之電訙、以巨大篇幅詳細登載、至街頭喚賣時、頃刻即盡、維也納日報復於社論中引起前法總理克萊孟梭所稱薩爾區内有法籍人民十五萬法人今民已淘汰、僅存二千人之譜、蓋克萊孟梭生前固主張法國吞併薩爾者也、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（維也納）聯邦宣傳委員會主任愛國特務隊長亞當氏、頃發麦無綫電廣播演説、謂此次薩爾公民投票、百分之九十贊成歸還德國、非僅國社黨之願望如此、其他各黨之願望亦復如此、但此輩所贊成者乃德國、而非國社黨所主持之德國、又謂「薩爾投票德國勝利、德國民族之希望、由此實現、此吾人所當欣幸者也、吾奥人對於德國之觀念、與對於黨派之意見、絕然分爲兩事、毫不相混、奥國係自由之德題、奥國自有其觀察點、對於德國與德國一時執掌政權者、絕不願如以混合了也」云支、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各報之社評</h3>
<p>法德提携架成橋樑</p>
<p>（柏林）今日各報評論、稱述薩爾投票結果之快慰後、均引希特勒演説中之語、謂「薩爾歸還德國後、法德間之領土爭執問題、已完全消失」云、宣傳部戈培爾演説中、亦謂「隣接兩大民族間之提携、今已架成一過渡之橋樑、吾人今日或即在歐洲政治之歷史的轉變期、此則當歸功於德國之果斷政策、而惟希特勒足以代表之」云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>俄慮德人東進野心（莫斯科）蘇聯消息靈通人士對於薩爾公民投票、歸併德國派獲得絕大多數一事、多表示驚　異、但謂薩爾投票獲此結果、實由國社黨猛力宣傳及薩爾人民　愛國觀念之所致、此外蘇聯人士亦與其他各國人十抱同樣見解、以爲投票結果分明、使西歐局勢爲之澄清、而以法德關係爲尢然、一般人復以爲希特勒最近或將作益之具體建議、以期成立法德之諒解、但德國於薩爾投票後權威增加、趾高氣揚、或將在中歐政治前線抵抗力較薄弱處、再作胃險徼倖之舉、則殊爲可慮云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>社會道德應予尊重　　梵諦岡敎廷機關報「羅馬觀察報」評論薩爾投票結果、希望立即發生社會的道德的反　、以有裨於廣大之各平事業、但嗣後薩爾區域、是否不至發生殘暴復仇之行動、則屬未定云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）季諾維夫·加米尼夫·及其他人員案件之公訴狀、已由此間公佈如下、前此謀殺基洛夫氏之秘密反革命恐怖團體案、當其偵查之際、證明有所謂［莫斯科中心團］者、乃由前季諾維夫反蘇維埃派領袖組成、該轉雖經投降、然其秘密工作並未停止、究其目的乃在遵照所謂季諾維夫·特羅茨基政綱、實現其反革命企圖、同時在莫斯科進行秘密反革命工作、現經證明所謂［莫斯科中心團］者、其團員爲季諾維夫·愛夫杜基莫夫·格爾迪克·巴卡耶夫·古克令·加米尼夫·莎浴夫·費杜洛夫·及戈爾希寗等、彼等復在自己周圍組織前季諾維夫反蘇維埃派積極之分子、同時與列寗格拉團體各份子（卽於一九三四年十二月二十八二十九兩日經最高法院軍法處判者）保持經常關係、根據費杜洛夫本人供辭、證明「莫斯科中心團」爲數年來指揮莫斯科及列寗格拉兩地黨徒之政治中心、此項由「莫斯科中心團」領導之秘密反革命團體、其主要目的之一乃在保存其「幹部」、積累其實力、增强團員對於黨及蘇聯政府領袖之惡感、關於國内外事件在其團員中廣傳歪曲事實之報告、並爲之作公開反革命之说説明等等、此等反革命「報告」、乃由最接近季諾維夫及愛夫杜基莫夫者傳播、而季愛二人則利用其在政治上之地位、以實行其犯罪目的、審訙時證明「莫斯科中心團」團員古克令·格爾迪克·愛夫杜基莫夫·及莎洛夫等、卽循此而行、彼等經常至列寗格拉、而與「列寗格拉中心團」團員保持反革命之聯繫、據費杜洛夫供稱、此項秘密反革命團體、當其作反蘇聯政府鬭爭之際、恒不擇手段、在此季諾維夫秘密團體酖毒氛圍之中、法西鬭爭方法及公開恐怖心理之養成與加强、初非偶然、而結果遂釀成基洛夫暗殺事件、關於此案之被告以及須行繼續調查案件之被告、均謂此種傾向乃季諾維夫派秘密工作整個性質與内容之必然結果、且爲無可避免者、被告柴爾科夫亦如是云云、並稱、尼科萊耶夫之暗殺手段與此「極端傾向」直接有關、彼謂後者乃以季諾維夫反革命企圖爲根據云、又被告巴希吉洛夫稱、「尼科萊耶夫之出於暗殺、正以其爲特羅茨基委諾維夫反革命組織成員、且受其敎育之故、故整個特羅茨基委諾維夫反革命組織對此應負責任、」審訙時並未證明「莫斯科中心團」對於暗殺基洛夫行爲曾經允准或經指令、唯就「莫斯科中心團」之空氣與性質而論、彼等必深知該團團員之有恐怖主義傾向、甚且對此傾向加以煽動、「莫斯科中心團」團員、特别爲季諾維夫·愛夫杜基莫夫·格爾迪克·及加米尼夫諸人、在道德上及政治上須負全部責任、不僅如是、按照蘇聯法律而言、彼等對於自身反革命行動之成果、（即迫令彼等列寗格拉團體走向恐怖行動之途、）亦須負責、被告等本人對於此種責任、至少在道德及政治上、亦無法否認、</p>
<p>被告季諾維夫述及彼對十二月一日殺事所負任時、曾謂、「事態之客觀發展如是、予祇能服罪、藎前年列寗格拉反黨運動既尖説若是、則不能不促成此等革命家之堕落也、此次暗殺對於前此整個反黨運動投上如是不觪觧之光、故予承認、谓前季諾維夫反黨謂體對基洛夫暗殺事件應負政治上之責任云云、乃應對正確者、」</p>
<p>其他如與此案有關而經審訙之被告如巴卡耶夫·戈爾希寗·費杜洛夫·愛夫杜基莫夫·莎洛夫·古克令·及格爾迪克等、均承認爲「莫斯科中心團」團員、格森·潘列莫夫·勃拉伏·黑爾茲堡·伐維洛維契·及薩霍夫等、承認參加諾維夫反革命團體、柴爾科夫·安尼希·巴希吉洛夫·及泰拉索夫等、承認彼等參與列寗格拉季諾維夫反革命團體、</p>
<p>加米尼夫承認其罪狀、且謂直至一九三二年爲止、彼曾參加秘密反革命行動、且曾爲「莫斯科中心團」團員、唯至今並未與季維諾夫完全斷絕關係者、僅因若干日常生活條件之關係耳、加氏並承認彼「對墮落現象未能作十分積極與有力之鬭爭、此種現象爲反黨運動之結果、同時根據於此、前此反黨團體之渣滓、遂有產生匪類之可能、同時彼等遂能實現其犯罪行爲、」</p>
<p>季諾維夫承認其罪狀、且證實確有季諾維夫派中心之存在、同時彼確參與其事、根據上述各節、被告十九人所犯罪狀如下、其中多數參加秘密反革命團體「莫斯科中心團」、其餘則積極參加莫斯科及列寗格拉兩地秘密反革命團體之活動、結果造成暗殺基洛夫之舉、換言之彼等乃犯刑法第十七欵及第五十八欵第八第十一兩節所舉之罪云、（十五日塔斯電）</p>

<p>彭祥瑛</p>
<p>講演市民與防空關係</p>
<p>中西廣擴電台、前日由彭祥瑛氏講演、「市民與防空的關係」、立論頗爲精詳、茲將其講詞刊錄如左、</p>
<p>防空」這個名詞、在最近確是引起了世界上許多國家、許多人民的深切注意、不過、這個名詞的來源、到現在也只有十幾年的歷史、自從歐戰時、德·英·法·三國、彼此使用飛機、參加作戰、襲轚她們的敵對國家的重要地點、摧毀戰鬥力量、以之用爲屈服敵人的手段、而才產生了這個新名詞、當時作戰的國家、因爲忽然間遭受了這種天中飛機襲轚的損害、才感覺現時的國防設備、非先有防空的設備、是不能够作戰的資格、所以世界各國、爲保全國家的立塲、領土的完整、無不積極建設防空、就是各國的人民、也深感到生命財產的保障、在現時代中、没有防空的設備、是無從企托的、因此大家也就拼命的援助政府、從事防空建設、同時並積極的從事個人的防護設施、尤其在現在這個名詞的活躍、在人們的腦海中、更加估據了一個大大的地位、時時刻刻、都爲着這種新的刺激、大聲疾呼的喚着「救命救命」、只有「防空防空、」才是有效的方法、這個名詞、受着人們這様的狂熱呼喚、於是格外的新興起來了、</p>
<p>但是這個新興名詞、在過去十幾年、已經在世界各國極度的活躍、而我們中國、却是視若無睹、直至「九一八」和「一二八」的事變發生、日本用她新銳優越的飛機、烽毀了我們的錦州·烽毀了我們的上海·等處、尤其在虹口及閘北一带的上空、大施殺戮的乎段、燒燬了我們無數的房屋、烽死了我們無數的人民以後、這個名詞、方如天空中落下無數鋒銳的尖刀似的、給予了我們的認識、使我們知道飛機的轟炸、確是不能不畏懼的、因此、這個在我們中國十幾年來無人注意的新興的「防空」名詞、也漸漸地給予一般國人的賞識、而認爲是注意的必要、</p>
<p>可是現在還有許多人、以爲防空的設備、祇要有飛機和高射砲去擔任空中與對空的防禦、就可以够了、同時以爲防空的責任、完全是應由政府負擔、與人民毫不相干、這種錯誤觀念、完全是因爲對於空軍和任務和防空的要素、没有澈底明瞭的原因、我們要知道、敵人的飛機、是取各種高度、由各主面襲來、無論我們的軍事防空、配備如何完密、高射砲的射轚、如何精確、欲將敵機掃數驅透、掃數轚堕於都市之外、是不容易做得到的、同時、還是需要我們赤手空拳的民衆、從事消極防禦、才能逹到防空的全般目的、譬如、在歐戰末期的倫敦、以十二隊的防空飛機、四百門的防空砲、防衛其領空來作一個證例、就可以使我們明瞭了、那時候、倫敦雖然有這様偉大的防空配備、然而敵機尙有百分之十至百分之三十乘間隙而侵入倫敦的上空、逹其轟炸之目的、這便是一個　明的鐵證、况購置各種高射砲和　飛機、須要莫大的經費、以我國現在的經濟狀况、一時必難購買多量的防空兵器、所以在今日的我國、尤其是要有民間防空的週密設備、是更需要人民有自動的防護設施、因爲民間防空、能組織完密、直接雖不能與敵機作若何的對抗、但間接確可避免或减少敵機空襲時候所受的損害、因爲敵機來襲的時候、最可怕的、是燃燒彈和　毒氣彈的投下、至於爆炸彈的威力、是只限於命中點的局部、其爲害沿屬有限、可是燃燒彈或毒氣彈、那就不同了、牠能使一個全市的精華、頃刻化爲灰燼、全城市的生命、也就立刻葬於毒墓、造成滿目焦土、鷄犬不留的慘况、至於毒氣的利害、盡人皆知、現在因時間關係、在此不能多講、祇好僅就燃燒彈的猛烈狀况來略加叙述、</p>
<p>燃燒彈種類的大小、有與手溜彈同様者、有重二公斤至二十公斤者、又依其使用目的的不同、有不發觸即、或侵入若干時後始發火者、其發火時、可發出三千度以上的高熱、雖是鋼鐵之類的物體、也就可以馬上溶化、燃燒的時間、可逹十五分鐘之久、延燒的範圍、且可逹一百平方公尺、而不能用水使之熄滅、</p>
<p>現今的轟炸機、携带的重量、已經有兩千公斤的能力、假若全載十二公斤重的燃燒彈、至少可裝載一百五十個、飛到我們的都市上空、立時就可以炸毀我們繁華的街市、同時還會引起一百五十處的火災、假若來襲的敵機是兩架、便可引起三百處的火災、假設牠的彈着點有三分之一不能命中、也就可以使兩百處地方起火、在這個時候、無論消防隊如何努力、救火車如何充實、也就有顧此失彼、陷於不能施救的危局、况且在道路橋　、同時被其破壤、房屋崩倒、通信綫燒斷的時候、救火車因爲行動和通信、受不靈的阻障、不能發揮其能力、市民的財產和　身命、也就只有任聽火災之摧　毀而已、（未完）</p>

<p>明年柏林世界運動會</p>
<h3>會塲建築偉大可驚</h3>
<p>建筑費一千萬馬克</p>
<p>希特勒視此大運動會</p>
<p>與國家政府尊嚴有關</p>
<p>（柏林十四日國民電）偉大無匹之明年柏林世界運動會塲、目下正在建築之中、儘多之工人皆在積極工作、使此偉大之建築、能凖時告竣、建築之計劃、悉出元首希特勒之意、自希握政後、即反對將原有之運動塲、加以修葺、此塲原爲一九一六年之大會而建、卒因歐戰而未曾舉行、</p>
<h3>各項建築計劃槪觀</h3>
<p>目下之新計劃、即將原有建築、全部取銷、僅用留下之地基耳、新計劃不特在原址起建一大運動塲、且在與運動塲接連之處、建一預備開幕典禮所用之空大草地、四週圍以大看台、再有露天戲院、一獨立之大游泳池、一自由車用之跑道、一大網球塲、供足球及曲棍球用之塲地凡十二、更有二橢圓形跑道、以供練習之用、再有一小湖、可供練習游泳之用、僅僅在一角之原有之運動廳、保存未拆、共計六個之最新設備之運動廳、將作擊劍及其他户内運動比賽之用、除上述跑道大看台馬房水塔等等之外、將再建通達運動塲之新道路、與運動塲附近、將建立兩火車站、及地下車站、以備將來交通上之需用、</p>
<h3>容納觀衆人數可驚</h3>
<p>各項建築、俱偉大無比、大運動塲、可容觀衆十萬人、開幕用之空大草地、可容四十萬人、大會閉幕後、此大草地、將作普通比賽之用、在此大草地四週之一主要看台之上、將建一「希特勒塔」、高度達六十米、此外再有高屋四座、其下即爲大草地之進出口、露天戲院可容二萬人、網球塲游泳池各一萬人、自由車跑道看台一萬五千人、賽馬跑道七千人、馬房各可容馬一百匹、</p>
<h3>建築費一千萬馬克</h3>
<p>此偉大之工程、預計需一千萬馬克、一部份由政府津貼、其餘出諸各體育會、爲凑集此項鉅欵、故各種運動比賽門票、抽以一種特别稅、據專家觀察、一千萬馬克、恐尙嫌不足、然經費可毫無問題、因政府當局、及希特勒本人、皆視此大運動會、與國家及政府之尊嚴、有直接之關係、無論時間財力、皆將竭其所有、以使此大運動會、成功而偉大無匹、</p>

<h3>江蘇社會敎育之設施（三）</h3>
<p>（蘇敎廳長周佛海在省府紀念週報告）</p>
<p>上邊所說的、是江蘇社會敎育近二年來的重要設施、我們從多方面去考察、知道各縣縣政府和敎育局、對於社會敎育、大半還能悉心規盡、最值得我們注意的、便是社敎機關服務人員的態度、根本變更了、往前大家都以爲在社會敎育機關服務是很舒服的、現在這種觀念已根本没有了、從前大家做事的時候、都是隨便的做、現在每做一件事、都知道預先訂一個計畫、照着做了、從前所注意的、只是些靜的工作、與民衆没有什麽關係、現在已逐漸注意動的工作、與民衆發生關係了、往前的工作、是毫無目的的、現在大家都知道以標凖工作爲鵠的了、雖然現在辦理毫無成績的館不能說没有、但是大體說來、已經比從前進步得多了、只是社會敎育機關服務人員、尙未能眞正的到民間去、以後亦當設法推進、現在再說一說我們現在的計劃、</p>
<p>第一是重畫省立民衆敎育館輔導區域、過去各省立民衆敎育館所轄的民衆敎育輔導區域、縣份太多、輔導不無困難、現在已將六區董爲八區、將原設第二區之省立湯山農民敎育館、遷設南通區、另於東海區增設省立民衆敎育館一所、使各省立民衆敎育館輔導工作、得以進行便利、這一點現在已經實行了、</p>
<p>第二是切實推進各縣社敎機關標凖工作、各縣社會敎育機關已能注意標凖工作之實施、這是很好的璨象、惟對於實施的方法、還有未能十分明瞭、現在再訂一個「標凖工作推進方案」、令飭各縣社敎機關遵照推進、並令省立社會敎育機關、於輔導各縣社會敎育時、切實加以指導、</p>
<p>第二是實施電影敎育、我們爲用電影作爲實施社會敎育的工具起見、本年度對於電影敎育、擬特别注意、除已令各省立社會敎育機關、購置電影機、巡廻至各縣設映電影外、並擬自製電影影片若干種、主席所編的飲水衛生、已攝製完成好朋友、江蘇省會等、正在攝製中、</p>
<p>第三是試行政敎合一、我們知道現在各縣社敎機關所做的事、往往與區公所做事、相重複、結果、社敎機關因爲没有政治的力量、推行不能盡利、區公所因缺乏敎育的方法、進行也不能有園滿的結果、爲補救這種缺點起見、特會同民政廳指定崑山··宜興·南通等縣、試以農民敎育館長兼任區長、以試行政敎育合一、如果將來試騐有成效、那才是我們社會敎育大好的出路哩、</p>
<p>第四是整頓社敎機關、以往省立社會敎育機關的組織、多未能一致、縣立社會敎育機關的組織、亦不免紛歧、現在擬製訂規程、令飭統一組織、以便管理、且縣立社會敎育機關有的經費太少、不能發展、擬盡量設法增加經費、使每館每年至少要有兩千元、如一時辦不到、以後擬逐漸增加、至於縣館每年經費在三千元以上的、亦不免浪費、以後也要逐漸的核减、至於其他無甚成績的駢枝機關、以後擬酌量裁併、以資節省、</p>
<p>第五積極惟行新生活、新生活運動、可以說就是實施民衆的公民訓練、社會敎育機關、應努力的推行、我們已經製訂社會敎育機關推行新生活辦法大綱、令各社會敎育機關、切實推行、以後還有加緊的督促、使新生活運動、在社會敎育方面、能著有特殊的成效、</p>
<p>總之江蘇社會敎育應改進的地方正多、還有待吾人去努力、　　（完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>於是就接二連三的招着手，意思是呌他過去。李士廉看是看見了，無如這一下大撞，全身都撞得失了知覺，展動不得，只好假裝在想什麽心事，對張介夫微笑而後，依然昻了頭向天上望着。張介夫和他，也是在潼關相遇，初交中的朋友，自然也不便問他，在這裏爲什麽出神。而况自已還是别有點用意，也是不能大聲問話的，只好把頭縮轉回房去了。可是也不到五分鐘，他又伸出來望着。李士廉站着呆了許久，精神也就恢復過來了，不好老是不理他，就順着他招手走進他屋子來。張介夫掩上了房門，立刻刻了他的手，低聲道；你和程程先生説話，我已經都聽到了。旣是他和高廳長袁廳長都認識，我們大可以借這個機會，進行起來，你，看怎麽様？剛才你那様的出神，想好了什麽主意没有？李士廉心想，我剛剛探出一條路子來，你就要來進行，假如你有這様的機會，肯不肯携帶我呢？你這可惡的東西。於是笑道；當然呵！我們都是東方來的，難得在這裏遇着，若是能够在一處共事，豈不是好嗎？又低着聲音道；只是這位程先生，有些古怪脾氣，肯不肯和我們這生朋友帮忙呢？張介夫道；我們若是就要求人家介紹事情，那自然是太早了。我們只要他言前語後，在兩位廳長面前提一聲兒，得着機會，許我們見面談談。我們本來是要請人寫八行介紹的了。現在見着了廳長，讓他腦筋裏，留下我們一個印象，再經八行一催，那時，他想着是有這麽一個人，還不壞。（一一四）</p>
<h3>剛鬣公小史</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>公，姓（朱），名（羅），以歲次亥年生，故字日（豕），或謂以在母胎，滿四月而分娩，又日以食不潔，乃以（豕）屬之，未知孰是；考揚子方言，（豕，關東西，亦謂之（　），恒與母雞並處，爲農家所喜，記云（豕肥，則毛鬣剛大，（自是遂以（剛鬣公）三字名於世顧公禀賦愚魯，鮮思慮，人以其馴而易畜，日以豆渣飼之，漸壯碩，防其逸，植其笠，而公乃食飽則睡，睡醒則又食，不半載，而産子，多至二十四頭，豢者大喜，日，（此致富之基也，）昔范蠡嘗以畜牧，三散其家財，稱（朱公），其術蓋非無由。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （萍）</p>
<p>薩爾歸返德國，已經華爾堡廳正式公佈，這一幕轟動世界的競選，揭開了歐洲和平的曙光，滿天陰　，一朝消散，德人戰後的恥辱，努务十五年而完全湔雪，他們舉國慶祝，自是理所當然。</p>
<p>薩爾歸德，東北如何？這是國人應有的感想。薩爾人在此期間忍辱負重，未嘗一日或忘祖國，這次選舉，竟有百分之九十贊成歸德，正是東北同胞絶好的教訓！我以爲收回東北，最好能避免武力，也由國聯倡議，實行選舉，以定東北之誰屬？</p>
<h3>冬的雨夜</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>冬季裏的夜雨，老是那麽不激不驟的飄着，像微塵那麽的輕輕飄着電桿木上的電燈，白茫茫的像籠罩在大霧裏，只顯着像西瓜那麽大的一團沉寂的白光。</p>
<p>大商舖門口的霓虹燈，十九都已熄滅了，雖然時候還只黄昏的十點鐘。間或有一二家，還没把霓虹燈旋熄的，可是櫃裏的夥友們，都已把手籠在衣袖裏，伏在櫃上發着怔，靜靜地聽着收音機裏播送着的催眠曲。</p>
<p>冬季大减價的旗幟，給雨打得紅綠字都褪了色了。水從下綠滴上怱迫而蹣跚着步子的行人的肩頭。</p>
<p>街道是那麽泥濘，泥濘得汽車駛過時，汚水隨着車輪子，直飛上人行道上的行人的臉上。</p>
<p>空氣是沉悶得甚麽似的，若末有嘴裏咬着烟蒂兒，嘴裏和身上放着難聞的氣息的乞丐，跟在背後閙蹩扭，行人們或許會疑心着這是在倫敦，而不是置身在這個東方第一大都市裏了。</p>
<p>賣夜報的童子的喊聲，無力地在路口的懶懶地放着光的紅綠燈下面顫抖着，在行人稀疎的人行道上顫抖着。夜報裏是滿含着水份，也特别地顯得沉重。</p>
<p>在某飯店門口，洋車夫坐在泥汚的車踏上候着主顧，無聊的撩天。</p>
<p>（他媽的，這雨再下三天，咱可就一家子都餓死啦）。其中的一個咕嚕着。</p>
<p>（可不是麽？俺昨兒個只拉了八個小八開，完了租，大餅都没得啃呢。今兒也只拉了一吊多些兒，·····）</p>
<p>猛的從大飯店門口，傳出了一聲（黄包車），便把他們的話頭打斷了，爭着把車子凑過去。</p>
<p>但是除了其中的一個，拉着主顧去了，其餘的，依然是坐在泥汚的車踏上守着，哈着氣，瞧着不激不驟的雨，像微塵般的飄着。</p>
<h3>勿蹈前轍</h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<h3>九出十三歸</h3>
<p>— 黄權</p>
<p>前幾天在春秋上看見一篇關於歐洲當業的文章，不禁使我想起廣州當舖的（九出十三歸）。</p>
<p>怎麽呌做（九出十三歸）呢？</p>
<p>我在廣州的時候，很多時都要跑進當舖的，我抱的主見是；（有當有贖上等人，有當無贖中等人，無當無贖才是下等人（；因此我進當舖的時候，並不害羞，而且不但敢和朝奉説價錢，有時還多談幾句話。</p>
<p>在我和朝奉的談話中，我懂得了所謂（九出十三歸）。</p>
<p>當你拿一件東西到當舖上當的時候，説明是可以當得一塊錢的了，而且當票也明明是寫着一元，但他只給你九角，白白的替你打個九折，這就呌做（九出）。當你拿當票去贖的時候，你須要加三給他，卽早贖這件東西就要一元三角了，這呌做（十三歸）。</p>
<p>很多時我曾和朝奉爭論起來，但他却説！（這是行規，當不當隨你），教人没有辦法，窮困得很，才去當東西的呀！有什麽辦法敢跟他門氣，説不當呢！</p>
<p>（九出十三歸）的確是重利剥削窮人的勾當，廣東政府也曾幾次通令禁止，但多數的當舖還是陽奉陰違呢。</p>

<p>這是專門給初學射箭的人所備的！因爲要求射出去的箭能够有凖確的方向，第一便不可不講究射箭的姿勢；而要講究射箭的姿勢，又必先注意兩條臂膀的部位，旣不可太高，更不能太低，也就是必須使那縬弓擎得恰到好處。話雖然很簡單，學習起來，却委實非常不易，而且又不是教師們口頭所能教導得會的，必須本人自已下苦工；要下苦工，這兩個懸空的鐵環便是一件絶好的輔助品！每個學習弓箭的人，不借重它們是不能希望有進步的！理由是人的肩膀極容易活動，舉弓的時候，往往不免太高，太低，或偏側，不能永遠保持着適當的位置，於是一起首學習就用這兩個鐵環來範鑄他，先將兩手從鐵環中穿過去，恰好使他的肩膀給鐵環吊起，同時在旁指導的人，更酌量了他的身材的長短，把那兩條繫着環的繩或是拉高些，或是放下些，總是弄到恰巧適宜爲度，然後再把弓箭授給他，讓他就在這兩個鐵環的牽制之下，一次一次的學習。箭就從這後户中穿出去，落到箭道上；最初祇是毫無目標的亂射，但求他的姿勢能够凖確而已；待過了相當的時日之後，他的姿勢已因久受鐵環的束縛而由習慣成爲自然了，這様，他就得脫離了鐵環，走上箭道來專心學習有箭靶的射法了。你們大槪都不曾想得學射箭竟得下這様的苦功）！</p>
<p>這又是一課我們向來所不曾聽到的新功課！我眞不由暗暗地佩服太后的見多識廣了！後來伊自已告訴我，伊之所以能獲得這些零星夾雜的頟識，全在多看書，可見看書正是一種最良好的習慣！（二二四）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>世界最貴偶像　西班牙的泰拉哥那市立銀行的地下室，現在保存了一個世界最貴的偶像，價值百萬元，因爲這偶像是在紀元三百年前死的小兒墓中掘出的，全身用大理石雕刻，長不過三寸，面容似猿，玲瓏百愛。</p>
<p>獨身者課重稅　大凡到過歐洲的人，誰都知道獨身無偶者，不但爲社會所不齒，而且受政府種種虐待，近來南斯拉夫國規定一種法律，凡年在三十歲以上，如未配偶，不論男女，均須課重稅，交通部對於新婚旅行者，在國内的鐵道，得享車資半價的權利，可是該國百計奬勵結婚，而結婚之數，依然不多，這是社會不景氣的一種象徵</p>
<p>妻妾廉價出售　南非洲的德蘭司維亞爾地方的土人，以妻妾爲一種主要財産，蓄養愈多即表示其財産愈實，倘若經濟拮据的時候，就可轉讓他人，有錢時亦得隨時購入，最近世界不景氣，妻妾的售價暴落，竟不值畜牛之價一半，上等年輕婦女，最高僅售十六金鎊，次等售十金鎊，三十歲以下二十五歲以上的中年婦人，每名六金鎊，三十歲以上至三十五歲的半老徐娘，僅售二鎊，但是該處的耕牛每頭也要售三鎊，所以人反不及牛值錢啊。</p>
<p>世界最高電話　從商馬里到阿爾布斯的却波雷支亞山上，有一所小屋，這屋内裝設一座電話，通達歐洲重要各都市，電話機離海拔達九午六百八十尺，爲全世界裝置電話最高的地方，最近又在屋外裝設無綫電臺，亦將凌駕全世界所有無綫電臺的高度。</p>
<p>世界最大家族　美匣人强司乞司篤那德氏，年已八十六歲，其家族中有一百二十八人，爲美國向所未聞的新紀錄，他在六十六年的結婚生活中，生了男兒十一人，孫子三十六人，曾孫七十五人，玄孫四人，連同兒壻孫壻共有一百二十八人。</p>
<p>砂漠發見都市　阿刺比亞大沙漠南部的黑支拉馬德地方，最近爲德國探險家發見了文明的都市，這都市是在沙漠的當中，和像一座小島様子，其建設規摸甚大，街市清潔，溝渠排水等設備，亦很完全，中有高樓大厦，皆係煉瓦青磚築成，市的周圍，土質肥厚，宜於種種植，實爲天然的樂土</p>
<p>世界最大車頭　瑞士中部與意大利相聯絡的聖哥泰爾特鐵道，此次使用世界未聞的機關車，因爲運轉山地的急勾配方法，用八千八百馬力的電氣機關，這車頭重二百四十噸，能在時速四十哩疾駛時，突然停止，内裝有最新式馬達十六具，超越從前美國所誇的七千百二十五馬力的最在的機關車了。（冰玉）</p>

<h3>對（學生國貨年）的展望</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>時代的輪子，終于把多災多難的（婦女國貨年），很輕快地輾去了，而接着來的（學生國貨年），却也就開始啟露了他的序幕，從婦女到學生，國貨運動史上，又可添增了新的一頁，一般從事國貨的我們。自也不得不有一番更新的願望，從黑漆的途中，再去尋找光明的出路，現在，我們就在（學生國貨），這四個字上，作一度新的展望吧！</p>
<p>學生本是社會的中堅，知識階級的後備隊，現在，我們集全國大，中，小學校的學生人數，而推進這國貨運動，這力量自是偉大的，不過，我們更要知道，去年的婦女人數並不少，但，所得的成績却如此，那末，對於計劃未來的本年，自不能不更有一度精密的考慮，顯然的，目下阻碍國貨進行的唯一　結，是崇拜洋貨心理的依然未棄，婦女這様，學生也正這様，所以，這一點，我們要首先加以認清的。</p>
<p>崇尚洋貨心理的造成，依過去的事實，大學生本不能避免這（首倡）的責任的，無論是男的或女的，他們總因爲高度的虚榮心，爭眩鬥勝，把歐風美化，儘量採用，自大學而中學，小學而社會，全國靡然從風，弄到目下不可收拾的様子，所以，我們在這裏，雖不能説洋貨充斥這責任，完全要學生們來負，但，至少在未來的我們國産發展上，務必要根本斬絶這種惡劣心理始。</p>
<p>因此，我們在（學生國貨年）的展望上，首先就是需要學生們心理的改變，要知道，這是什麽時候了，外貨傾銷，已到要呑滅我全民族生機的階段，我們還要作物質享受的迷夢嗎？爲救民族，是擲頭顛，拚血肉，尚且不顧的，難道同民恊力，拒外貨於千里之外，就不能嗎？想站在時代尖端，豐有智識的我全國學生們，是早有這様深切認識的。</p>
<p>在最後，我就有很大的希望，要學生們負起這雙重的責任，第一是在消費的立塲上，來抵制洋貨，作有組織的宣傳，有計劃的制止，（繫鈴解鈴），使全國的人民，轉移過來樹立起服用國貨的信心，第二是在生産的立塲上，來求國貨的發展，從本年起，更努力於探研生産技能，尣識的充實，以備將來服務社會，國家的凖備，這様，我們的（學生國貨年）纔不虚負，經濟狂潮的挽回，也就有望了。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨的計劃</h3>
<p>— 楊燮理</p>
<p>去年是婦女國貨年，可是據海關公佈的報告，去年婦女所用的香水脂粉首飾等奢侈品輸入額竟超過二百萬元以上，所以大家都在痛駡婦女國貨年的没有成績！今年是學生國貨年，這個責任要輪到我們學生頭上來了。我想我們學生都是年輕氣壯，富有好勝心的，豈甘落人之後，受人卑棄！不過，凡事貴乎先有計劃，然後方有成效可期，現在不妨把我個人提倡國貨的計劃説一説。</p>
<p>在我没有説我的計劃之前，先得要把我的身世説明；我是無錫教育學院的大學生，教院是以致力民衆教育，從事農村運動聞名於世的，平日對於學生儉樸耐勞的生活習慣底養成，很是注意，並且規定凡是將要畢業的學生，都得下鄉實習，深入民間。我卽是受了三年多民衆教育的陶鎔，現在已經到鄉間來工作的一個。所以我們人的不用外貨，根本不是問題，我的計劃是怎様在民間提倡國貨？我預備；</p>
<p>（一）要改變民衆愛好的心理我們到鄉間來第一要緊的，就是接近民衆，使民衆信任你，然後可以在潛移默化中引他們上軌道。我們下鄉數月來，對於這方面很費一點心力，現在差不多已和民衆打成一片，民衆隨處有跟我們動的現象。</p>
<p>我們是一向就不用外貨的，我已經説過了。以後更可以以身作則，購用國貨，轉換民衆目光，改變民衆心理，或者藉着民衆的這點信任心，能够移風易俗！况且，所謂（時髦），本没有一定標凖，不過一時風尚所趨罷了，我們又何難以服用國貨爲風尚呢？</p>
<p>（二）要提高民衆國家觀念鄉間的民衆對於國家觀念，很是薄弱，所以根本就不知道什麽（國貨）（外貨）。對於抵制外貨，提倡國貨的道理，更是莫明其妙。所以我們在教育民衆的時候，要注意提高民衆國家觀念；對於愛國志士的事實，民族英雄的史跡，要多多爲民衆講解。國際間現勢，和我國前途的危急，最好也使民衆得到一個大槪。</p>
<p>（三）要灌輸民衆國貨常識民衆對於外貨的種類，不大留意，買時又祗揀便宜，靈巧，和美觀的東西，所以最易被奸商利用，往往買了外貨，自已還不知道，所以我們要隨處替他們識别東西，或者合了幾家，將外貨用品收集起來，作爲標本，供大衆參觀，减少大衆受愚的機會；或徵集日用國貨，舉行展覧會，爲民衆講解其優點，灌輸他們國貨常識。</p>
<h3>維護國營實業</h3>
<p>— 徵</p>
<p>我國政府對於外商經營之工廠。其待遇及保護。較諸國人自已所經營者爲優厚。外商工廠所負担之捐稅。往往輕於國人工廠。因此在市塲上。本國工廠之出品。成本反而較重。難與外商工廠競爭。卽如硫酸一項。上海製造硫酸之工廠。祇有兩家，一爲英商所經營之江蘇藥水廠。一爲國人所辦之開成造酸廠。此兩廠所用之原料。進口同様納稅。開成未能邀免。而對於出品硫酸。江蘇硝磺總局所徵之稅。每箱一元。江蘇藥水廠。則因外商經營之故。可以拒納。而開成之出品。則必須照繳。因此每箱成本加重一元。而售價又須與外貨相等。否則不能競銷。最近一月一日起，政府又增加火酒統稅。租界内外商所辦者一槪不繳。而華商所辦者均須照納。否則火酒統稅局。派員駐廠監視。不准出售。因之華商火酒廠其出品與外貨比較。每介侖成本加重一元。無法競爭。以上情形。與一月九日英文大美晚報社論。所舉中國政府苛待外商工廠之異議。事實上適得其反。最近東西各國。對於本國能充分自給之出品。莫不加重進口稅。或由政府特予奬勵金。以資保護。所以維持國内之工業。處處爲國防着想。歐美各國之對付日本。以及日本之對付歐美各國。莫不採用此政策。中國今日國内工業所以不能發達。其最大原因卽在政府未能充分行此保護政策。不平这鳴。應出之於受害華商。而不應出之於享受特權之外商。虎狼之食牛羊。虎狼反作悲鳴。豈不怪哉。國人所希望於政府者。不求其驅逐虎狼。惟求其築防禦之具。以保護牛羊。使不受虎狼之殘害而已。否則萌牙之工業。永無長成之希望。國家何能賴外貨以生存。深願我當局注意及之。</p>
<h3>服用國貨之意見</h3>
<p>— 劉平寄塵</p>
<p>我國歷年受列强經濟侵略之後，一切生産事業莫不因之土崩瓦解，卽以國貨而論，雖經政府竭力提倡，社會人士一致努力，如公定（國貨年）（婦女國貨年（及（學生國貨年）以資號召，但結果依然不能抵制外貨之輸入。推原其故多係國人不愛用國貨所致。而國貨廠商及各公司對於産銷方面。亦多缺點，際茲學生國貨年開始之時，凡我國民，除個人服用國貨以身作则外，當务勸家人親友一致崇尚國貨，爰就管見所及，分述於後；</p>
<p>（一）改良貨品　我國國貨，經久耐用，人所共知。惟對於製造方面，墨守成法，不求精進，或粗製濫造，偷工减料，一與歐美出品相較，難免相形見拙，國人所以捨國貨而購外國貨者以上。嗣後務使國貨與外貨同様精美，甚至駕舶來品而上之，行見國貨銷行，突飛猛進</p>
<p>（二）减低價格　國貨正值萌牙時代，又因外貨傾銷貶價，一般喜用洋貨者，趨之若騖，如國貨價格過高，則人皆裹足，亟應抱定薄利主義，减低成本，使人人腦中有國貨價廉物美之印象，庶幾國貨推銷，事半而功倍。</p>
<p>（三）確保信譽　我國商人，誠實無欺者固不乏人，間有一二商家，或以次貨而售高價，或以僞貨而圖冒牌；不惜以滑頭手段對付顧客，此種行爲，於商人道德信譽，喪失殆盡，國貨之不振，亦無不受此影響，亟應劃一定價，貨眞價實，以保信譽。</p>
<p>（四）訓練店員　嘗見日本商店，職員對待顧客，和露可親，極盡禮貎，反視我國商店人員，招待顧客，毫無誠意，甚至盛氣凌人，尤以大商店職員習氣最壞。鄙意男女店員，應嚴加訓練，使人人有商業經騐，養成温和性格，顧客光臨，殷戁招待，倘得人人滿意，何患不顧客盈門，賓至如歸？</p>
<p>（五）宣傳之道　商業競爭，不外宣傳，外貨品之能暢銷於我國市塲者，類多得力於宣傳二字，我國對於此道，僅在廣告上大吹大擂收效尚微，宜添用交際廣闊經騐豐富之男女宣傳員，深入民間，作切實之勸導，以激發其愛國之心，俾家喻户曉，口頭與紙上宣傳，同時並進，則收效必宏。</p>
<h3>歡迎學生國貨年</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>在强國貨的人民，用國是天職，惟有中國人，用國貨要賴提倡和宣傳，甚有（笑駡由他笑駡！洋貨我自購之！）是何等羞恥的事！從國貨年遞到婦女國貨年，脂粉香水，入超的數字，反變本加厲！提倡和宣傳，似乎多此一舉！</p>
<p>物換星移，各機關團體所定的（學生國貨年）又已呈現在吾人的眼前，誰不知學生是頭腦最清醒，心地最愛國的有爲分子，過去的五四運動，曾留爲中國歷史上最光明的一頁！則在（學生國貨年）中，賴學生做暢銷國貨的推動機，必有非常滿意的成績！而在各商業機關中的學生，尤應共同起來，站在一條戰綫！</p>

<h3>南洋市塲考察記（二）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>丨項康元先生的談話丨</p>
<p>（問）日人旣拓展南洋商塲，殖民政府曾有什麽對策？</p>
<p>（答）南洋羣島除英荷兩國的殖民地以外，如美屬菲律賓法屬安南，早有極高的關稅壁壘，阻止非宗主國貨品的大量輸入，故在以上兩地，日本自難滿足其慾望。而英屬馬來亞及荷屬東印度，深感日貨傾銷，影響其本國工商業的發展，近已先後實施統制貿易，限制日貨輸入，因此日貨在南洋市塲，已大受打擊，日商已起恐慌，紛紛要求其政府與英荷兩國殖民地當局交涉，但英國政府爲保護其主要工業蘭開夏紡織品原有的市塲，因此對於限制日本棉樴品輸入南洋英屬殖民地，似已抱有極大的决心，所以日方雖數次抗議，而終無效果。至於荷屬方面，自荷印政府宣佈五十六種商品入口限制律後，因日方嚴重抗議，爲和緩尖銳衝突起見，乃有日荷會議之召集。但此會議，數月中開幕以來，爲時數月，時而開展，時而緊張，到如今却没有絲毫的進步。日方處這惡劣環境之下，旣不甘束手待斃，惟有在南洋另闢途徑，以求其商品的生路。他們眞是苦思焦慮，努力鑽營，結果便得一很有擴充希望的新市塲，這新市塲是什麽，便是暹羅。提到暹羅，大家都曉得是南洋唯一獨立國，位於馬來半島東北之印度支那半島之上，面積約十九萬五千方里，人口約一千萬，人民以務農爲業，工業除碾米廠及鋸木廠外，其他輕重工業極落後，故爲工業品最良的市塲。暹羅對於日本，在政治上，暗中也有相當聯絡，如去年國聯大會表示否認僞國時，各會員國代表一致投否認票，而暹羅代表獨棄權，表示對日的好感，所以現在日本遭受南洋各國殖民地限制其商品輸入的時候，不得不向暹羅擴充其市塲，以謀補救。</p>
<p>（問）現在國貨向南洋推銷，能否順利進行？</p>
<p>（答）我以爲國貨欲向南洋發展，除貨品本身應力求精美適用外，第一要有政治力量來保護，第二須與當地政府訂立商約派遣使領；第三要解决運輸問題。我們華商要如向外找出路只靠自已的力量，政治未必能切實的保護，這一點來和日商相比，我們就望塵莫及了。有幾處地方，我們尚不曾派遣領事，訂立商約，（如暹羅安南）貿易上就很多窒礙，商品入口，他們可以自由抽稅或拒絶，你没有辦法。有時發生什麽交涉，中華總商會權宜行事，但商會不是辦理外交的對手，何能代表講話，他們也可以不理會的。依我看來，這兩點非從速解决不可！至於運輸一項，也非常重要，日本貨有日本國輪船負責輸送，可以説毫無困難，我們的國貨，非靠外國輪船裝運不可，運費一層，當然增加。例如日貨運往暹羅，每噸六元，而我國貨則需二十元，相差之鉅，可以想見。</p>
<p>（問）南洋華僑工商業的現狀如何？</p>
<p>（答）南洋市塲近幾年經過樹膠錫礦兩次風潮之後，市面已大不景氣，華商大資本營業，多半動搖，尤其小本營商，不易維持原狀。譬如一顆樹木，大資本工商業是樹幹，小工商業是根鬚，這樹幹與根鬚，是相維相助的，未有根鬚動搖而樹幹不搖撼者，欲固其本，先培其根，故我以爲爲這些基本力量，必須培養健全。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>春草與詩</h3>
<p>— 若無</p>
<p>王靜安先生在人間詞話裏這様寫着；（人知和靖點絳脣，舜兪蘇幕遮，永叔少年游三關爲詠春草絶調，不知先有正中細雨濕流光五字，皆能攝春草之魂者也，（這當然是很值得玩味的話，春草入詩詞，實在是極饒意象的。在江南二三月的時光，看着萋萋無數的草色，便容易使人得到一種百無聊賴的凄寂之感。寫春草可説是中國文人的特色，這或是氣質和環境使然吧！除了王氏説出的幾闋詞以外，我們還可看到秦少游的（倚危亭，恨如芳草，萋萋剗盡還生。）和梅聖兪另一闋詠草的少年游；（闌干十二獨凭春，晴碧遠連雲，千里萬里，二月三月，行色苦愁人，）都是充滿了淡淡的哀愁情緒的。至如元朝李梅谿六　令中的（依約天涯芳草，染得春風碧。）好雖好，但意境却完全兩様了。在古詩十九首裏，（青青河畔草）和（四顧何茫茫，東風搖百草。）都是引起人生出一種意境的句子，牠裏面没有什麽怨啦恨啦一類抽象的説明字眼，而是以具體的形象來傳達出詩人内心感情，遂使讀着的人得到一種無法抗拒的凄凉印象。魏晋時的名句（池塘生春草。）和（春草碧色。）也寫得十分自然，後來的如王胄的（春草無人隨意綠。）白居易的（草綠裙腰一道斜。）也都能以簡短的字句，來傳出微妙的抒情旨趣。後來我們在南宋的詞篇裏，常常看到有專詠春草的詞，而且多半是長調，在鋪排與對仗上，固然不缺乏優秀的技巧，但都未免（汐社）雕琢的風氣，所以每當我們讀讀很長的漫詞之後，覺得那詠物確是很（工），但留給讀者的總印象（Totalimpression)却反不及過去一些簡短的句子；從這裏，就可看出鋪排與用典，是反足以損壞藝術之統一與完整的了。近來讀到盧冀野的弱歲集，第一首板橋行是首六言詩，句子是；（春去王孫夢老，春來帝子魂銷，七十二家芳草，不知何處長橋。也頗能表現出一種春天的夢幻般的寂寞。</p>
<p>其實，詠春草的詩詞眞是多不勝舉，至如宋朝劉敞的（春草綿綿不可名，水邊原上藏抽莖，似嫌車馬繁華處，纔入城門便不生一。和王安石的）芳草知誰種，緣階已數叢，無心與時競，何革綠葱葱？）都是寓意於春草而别有寄託之作，這不是寫春草而是寫人了。我個人則非常歡喜不是專詠春草而把春草的精神都描繪出來的句子，暮春三月，江南草長，有燕子，有遠的樹，有帶着晚霞的落日，有夢一様飄忽移動着的行人，望着那一片碧色，眞帶來一種難以言説的寂寞的愉悅，只要嘴邊溜出一兩句詩詞，已把我們牽引到古詩人的田園春夢裏去了。</p>
<p>然而這説得離現世紀太遠了，我們的新詩人，是應以新的眼光新的情緒去看春草，而把牠用新的手法抒寫出來的。</p>
<h3>文人彷彿與窮寫下契約</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>文人與窮彷彿寫下契約一様，如果我們翻開古今中外的書籍，可以發現十個文人倒有九個窮的。前天看了石川啄木的兩條血痕（周作人譯），在後面有一段作者介紹，我看了倒頗受感動。啄木是日本澀民村的小學教師，月薪八元，常常感到生活的困灘。文人的著作與他的環境是很有關係的，在兩條血痕中有一個很可憐，很瘦弱，家境很窘困的不孩子新太郎，也許就是啄木自已的縮影，因爲他自已是患有肺病的。他的貧困的情形是不特不能籌劃醫藥費，而且時常的斷炊。後來他出版了一本歌集（悲哀的玩具，）僅僅售得廿元，才買了他平日想吃的補藥。恐怕藥也不能治愈他内心的憂鬰，在他還有吃完那補藥的時候，便與世長辭了。死的時候才二十七歲，美國小説家霍桑，最先出版書籍，没有人看，結果也是窮困不堪，遂不再想吃文章的飯，跑到塞勒門海關任事。後來又失業，受了他的妻的安慰，杜門不出，而著（紅字），遂一舉而成名。塞文狄斯也是很窮，衣服穿的很襤褸，而且欠了許多債。周作人自已的園地中有一篇塞文狄斯。云；（一五九○年十一月八日塞文狄斯爲得賒了值四十塊錢的布匹，由他和他的保人與布店訂立一個合同，還有四個公證作中，眞如傳中所説鄭重得儘够擔保公債了。一六○一年冬政府問他追還虧空的公欵時，他也是（自已尚無衣食之資），所以第二年下了牢，一他這様窮困，眞是可以。還有一位的作家，我忘了他的名字了，窮的把一切的東西都賣了，後來簡直無家可歸，夜裏便在馬路上溜躂。我們一方面覺得這位窮苦的作空可憐，然而一方面這事却是很有趣味的。</p>
<p>中國的詩人也是窮的多，如李白之（五花馬，千金裘，呼童將出喚美酒，與爾同消萬古愁。）實是寥寥無幾。因此使我想到詩文愁而愈工，或許有幾分的理由，因了窮的刺激，神經上必有一種變態，所以寫的詩文，多是深刻的。或者是想藉文章的安慰，而思想便入於神秘玄渺的境界，而成爲浪漫派，所以文人的窮，也是使他的文章成功的一個主要分子，</p>
<p>窮，在中國文人身上，却認爲是一椿很清高的事。明人屠赤水也是很窮，他的太太告譤他明天無米下鍋了，他却説；（明日之事，有明日在，且無負梧桐月色也。）這實在是没有法子的窮開心，然而以窮爲清高的心理，也隠隠的可以見出了。</p>
<h3>我底表叔</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>假使要預測一個民族底孩子們將來的命運，小學教師該是很值得研究的東西吧。</p>
<p>十年前，我從鄉下第一次跑到省城，還是一個什麽都感到陌生的小孩子。我底表叔非常厭惡我，説着（旣是在鄉下出世，就在鄉下過世好了）那様的話，後來看見我還没有呆鈍到十分可怕的程度，就對我親熱起來，教我學習一切東西。</p>
<p>（在世界上，如果忽略了一根鐵釘，那也算不得好好地在留心着的。幫我做一些粗重的家事，一有空的時候，就把我這箱書翻出來，一本一本地，讀上牠兩次吧！阿興（他底兒子底名字）不中用了，他寧願用手，不肯用腦筋。）</p>
<p>他那時在一間小學校裏當助教。因爲有時候要欠薪，或者發有折扣的紙幣，那二十二塊的薪額没有一次領得十足的。每回領錢回來，他就頓着脚，憤憤地駡着教育事業和在那裏面活動的一切人，發誓要改行，説卽使去當一個没出息的收發員或者錄事。</p>
<p>他非常胆怯，而且没有一個朋友，甚至連任何廣州人都具有的飲茶那種嗜好，都不會沾染過。一早就起身，依照着衛生學者所定下給一切康健富裕的人們遵守的規範；也依着那規範底訓示，在一定的適當的時間睡覺。在冬天，早上就額外地吃一碗由表嬸給他預備的臘味飯。除了發薪水那幾天之外，連生切煙都不抽，也不多説話，没聲没氣地，一頭老鼠那様生活着，謹愼，安靜，而且規律。</p>
<p>連他自已都承認是惟一的缺點，而並不下决心去改正的，是喜歡打小麻將那件事。凑巧有幾個臉上灰白的卑微的同事來了，他們就在一起賭，並且説着各種陳舊的笑話。跟熱心的青年人相反，他並不是一個沉迷的豪爽的賭博家。但一打起牌來，却認眞得非常利害；躬着腰，把有病的眼睛注意着每一小張花花綠綠的牌，額上，鼻子上，都滿滿地掛着汗珠；有時爲批評一張牌底錯誤，爭論上半個鐘頭。</p>
<p>當他父親病重的時候，因爲和他那已經死了的哥哥底兒子談到關於分家的事情，爭吵起來，還狠狠地互相毆打，過後就渾身抖顫地，眼睛閃着憂鬰的光輝，喃喃地對自已説；　　）什麽昏蛋東西！我做過對不起誰的事呢，我犯過什麽罪過呢，這世界怎麽得了？就是碰到閻羅王，除了説我愛打牌，也就找不出什麽别的疵瑕來的了······（</p>
<p>他把自已關在一間紫銅鑄成的獄室裏生活着。伴着小小的憤慨和咀咒，他用一切言語去解釋自已的行動，而不肯把自已釋放出去；斷絶各種冐險的念頭，擯斥能够使人類進步的思想和學説。看見社會底急劇的變動，他就笑笑地，好像在看着他底隣居底家運逐漸傾落似地，説出他底可笑的結論；</p>
<p>（只要人心没有死，什麽都會恢復原狀的吧。）</p>
<p>這里缺乏着一點，就是；我不知道他在上課的時候，怎様去訓誨那些純潔無辜的孩子們。</p>
<h3>人間世（二）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>這時，我一邊從黑暗中注視着我的老友的身影，一邊等待他的答話，等他回答我還要走多小路，或是把我領到什麽地方去。可是他不回答我，反倒越發深入一條黑暗的小巷中。路上没有一點燈火，一若和都市隔了緣。巷子約有三尺寛，至於地面上怎様，是濕的或是乾着的，全不是我這雙近視眼能分辨出來的，所以，由於脚步深一脚淺一脚的傾跌着，就給我在黑暗的巷中添出來輕重不同的聲響。但是，却怪，我的老友走起來那様熟習，確又讓我斷定出他不是有意欺騙我的。可是他旣然半天不答我話，禁不住我又問了一遍；</p>
<p>（朋友，怎麽儘在也走不到呢，是怎麽一回事？而且，總是走些黑路，你可是要把我領到什麽地方）？</p>
<p>（得，别嚕囌了。到了）。</p>
<p>他説完，停住脚步，在一家用板條釘成的小門上，有規律地一連敲了八下。我也站住脚，等待着。</p>
<p>（這是一個秘密機關）！</p>
<p>我這様一想，立時想到偵探小説中可怕的黑暗之窟，不過，無論怎様，我確信我的朋友不會陷害我，這就使我放了心，壯起胆量。候着，候着過一會賞識内中的風景。</p>
<p>這小巷，簡直像地獄，雖然我没有入過地獄，但從一般人的談論上説，似乎地獄是黑暗的這一回事没有人否認。可是，這可走到什麽地方了？容我想一想；我們從十五道街出發，走正陽街，轉入二道街，那麽這該是二道街附近的小巷。太僻靜了，站在黑巷中，你眞不會想到外面就是繁華的哈爾濱市。</p>
<p>等了一會，没有動靜，我的朋友又敲了八下，是的，千眞萬確他又是敲了八下，不少，也不多。</p>
<p>有輕微脚步聲從遠處傳過來，到板條門前停住了，開門的是個十三四歲的小姑娘，我們踏進門檻後，板條門隨即關上了。院裏也是像巷中似的一片黑，房子也在黑着，轉一個彎，我就跟我的朋友走進一間黑屋子裏。</p>
<h3>黔行散記（上）</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>過婁山關</p>
<p>當太陽没有出來的早晨，在這山窩予裏，總是陰沉沉地，籠罩着滿天的烟霧。</p>
<p>山看不到頭，層層疊疊地，山腰上，冒着濃雲，跟棉花是的，騰浮在海空。假使所住的客棧靠近這嘳雲的山頭，那，可以嗅到有一種異様的氣味的，據説那就是瘴氣。</p>
<p>雄鷄在這村鎭上，好像特别的多，一個呌，四下裏都應和着，不必看什麽時間，那天色是約模着有五點了，這，得趕緊的爬起來，預備着上路的。　　起來的第一步工作，要站在客棧的門口，觀看四週的天色的，因爲在行路者的心頭都緊緊地記着這句；</p>
<p>丨丨未晚先投宿，鷄鳴早看天的。</p>
<p>假使天色不好，被雨水冲積的泥濘山路，對於行旅會有很大的影響。而今天，還好，天雖然沉沉地，但那是常事，在陰沉裏似乎并没有落雨的様子，得，今天總算又幸運啦。</p>
<p>正是夏末的時候，在日間山窩子裏的悶熱，眞有點怕人，投宿的時候，疲　襲擊着的伕子們，自然是懶得睡在那囚牢般的棧房裏的，於此，客棧的廊　底下，變成了肉的圖家案，横七竪八的，睡滿了人，赭褐色的肉體襯和着灰黄的土地，色調是很動人的。</p>
<p>（起來呀，快點，公鷄唱過三遍啦！）伕頭喊着，拉開了破啞的喉嚨。這好像成了一種例行的公事，伕頭對於這一套是玩熟了。</p>
<p>伕子們都慌亂的起來了，揉着没有睡足的跟睛，一股怨意湧上了他們的面頰。</p>
<p>（老板娘，給，這是二百錢，連今天的早飯都有。（話）邊説，隨着，一條大粗花的被子丢進去，幾個當五十文的銅板擺在台子上。</p>
<p>老板娘在笑，久經風霜的幾條　文，在眼角間動了。</p>
<p>眞的，這似乎成了一種功課，無論在那個客棧裏投宿，每天的早晨，總有這麽一陣騷亂的。</p>
<p>就着喂驢子的石頭池子，洗個臉，有的也順便洗個脚，再胡亂的啃上兩碗粗米飯，開始的動乎了，轎子，滑杆，（註）花籃槓，從房樑造就的架子上挑到了棧房的門前，那祇是空的架了，舖頃的油布（註）和墊坐位的得子都要臨時舖紥起來的，但，東西雖則挑到了門前，人却輕悄的散去了，原因呢？在預備氣力。</p>
<p>（預備氣力）並不是舉行早操，也不是打什麽拳，而是要躺在木板鑲就的竹片床上，藉着竹筒的長槍和一盞半暗的油燈來使氣力振作的。</p>
<p>這也難怪，香烟賣得這様貴，大刀牌，紅桃牌，在都會裏所鄙棄的貨色，到這裏都要賣到二百多一盒，好的更不必説，也許没有。大土，倒是本地的特産，紫紅色的陶器做成的小盆子，裝滿一盆，分量有三錢，并且光色挺好，售價二百錢，眞够公道。</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、美棉雖跌十餘磅音、印棉又漲、人氣仍平、買者亦冷淡不多、市塲上一片荒凉之象、所有成交者、大都均係了結交易、結果各月跌一二角、午後市情仍無榮辱可分、拍開空釐甚多、市價更無上落、但大户之多空、皆偃旗息鼓、須待廢歷年關之後、再决難雄也、近月漲跌一角、達平、查賣出長豐一千二百五十包、同興三百五十包、新昌二百包、愼昌二百包、大豐二百包、買進大福四百包、元一五百包、錦昌二百五十包、大豐二百五十包、振大二百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>浮空補進近月花</h3>
<p>棉市近月頗堅、因交割時期接近、棉花檢騐處審查合格之貨、尚未十分充足、或者以後增加、亦未可知、查本月份成交之額、還剩九萬五千餘擔、因此浮空無貨者活動抵補、有一部份在遠月仍抛、午後聞印棉暗盤跌兩羅比云、</p>
<p>遠月花仍有抛户</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、印棉繼續上升、惟美棉下落、賣風稍濃、且同興長豐長和三家多頭了結不少、故市况頗見虚弱、人氣挫折、惟近月因交貨不暢而緊、遠跌五分、午後開盤、聞金價收盤又跌而疲、但拍至三盤、獲利者抵補、並因本月份浮户抵空、市盤乃轉堅挺、各月漲五分至一角、查賣出同興四千擔、賡豐九百擔、長豐三千五百擔、潤康一千二百擔、益康一千擔、源興昌三千二百擔、長和三千二百擔、買進源大一千一百擔、大孚一千五百擔、振大一千七百擔、賡豐一千擔、元德二千一百擔、永昌八百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>金條文案不定美棉多頭大批了結</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因國外市况良好、同業需求亦多、價格略漲、其後因金條文案之不定、大批多頭了結、市上逐步下游、同時金元銳漲、雜糧及股市疲軟、亦爲市况不振之要素、惟同業於價跌時、進胃甚濃、需要不佳將收盤時、因銀幣關係、稍形良好、現貨沉靜、計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌九至十五磅音、英棉市况穏固、現貨漲六點、期貨漲二點、印棉投機家買進、日商售出、並有若干套賣、計平果爾漲二角半、奥姆辣漲一羅比、白羅淝溪漲二·七五羅比、原電錄左、（十五日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　標粉回漲結果平常</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈先跌後漲、漲後轉平之象、以洋麥報價、之芝加哥跌九角另至一元三角左右、坎拿大跌二角至六角另不等、當開價時、以洋麥大跌、人心之虚軟、自爲意中事、故各月份開價、即跌一二分不等、惟洋麥大跌、標準跌度未巨、則又爲謠傳所左右、以市塲盛傳、洋麥又有加稅之説、及一部分廠方將須减車、是以二盤市面、即因此種情形、反呈漲勢、至收盤近期與前日相仿、遠期反漲一分外、出入巨大、可以想見、迨至下午開盤、趨勢已呈緩和、交易亦已减少、計上午做四五十萬包、下午　廿萬左右、、廠家出數、則　二三十萬包、下午之初好後平、即因廠出過巨所數也、觀泰後步、以洋麥之　康、或者重須平疲也、結果一二月份不動、三月份爲七釐半、四月份好半分、五月份不動、六月份、好七釐半、</p>
<p>小麥近期小遠期高</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份先平繼穏、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌九角零至一元二三角、坎拿大跌二角至六角不等、當開價時、本月份交易、尚見活躍、開價小去三五分不等、遠期各月份、初亦平平、旋因粉市回漲、兼有洋麥加稅之説、市氣比較良好、較初開回好二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份趨勢平平、出入不多、遠期因出户轉稀、價亦略好、但謠傳未能盡信、故買户亦未十分暢旺也、結果本月份跌三分、二月份大五分、三月份大二分、四月份大五分、現麥市况、亦見瀉跌、較週初跌八分至一角不等、開出東歸德宿州麥三元九角一分、次九角、瑤灣麥三元八角九分、河南麥三元八角四分、計八千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源因　靜、阻船共到六十餘號（貨共萬餘石）、人心益餒、銷塲呆而不化、雖包胃有威海衛帮續動七八百包、然以貨湧、終覺供過於求、形勢續疲、市色更頽、行情迭見下垂、如各晚稻價貶落一角至角半、各厚粳竟跌二角、杜洋尖因亦疲跌角許、陰變元並見幣軟角許　　（滬北）昨日河下各貨到船二三十號、市上各色消　、白粳羊杜埠客尖呆細、變元勒價稍化、薄稻早稻平淡、白粳價小一二角不等、羊杜尖變元薄稻早稻小近角、</p>
<h3>現洋米回漲一角</h3>
<p>定貨新到二船</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、晨間開價已各喊高、因前晚西貢暹羅産價飛漲之電報到達後、市上人心一振、囤户心思堅定、不願再爲回脫、且有新囤户趁機收買、而本街内地、胃口尤香、内地辦去暹羅碎米四千六百包、本街去西貢三千包、售價步漲角許、期米回籠减少、只開三四五月各一百噸、洋行售出一二月份一千噸、行情回好一角及數分、昨日市形極佳、本客胃口甚貪、後市似有步砌之必要、惟定貨逐步抵申、昨日新到二船、已泊義泰興棧等卸貨、總計有十萬包左右、大約今明日尚有一二船可到、十二月一月期之定貨、或須在陰歷年内趕到也、客秈市面本居平軟、昨被洋米帶起二分、全市由本街内地辦去三千五百包云、　　糖市　粤粗砂白首盤標賣</p>
<p>價十八元七角</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢依然平軟、公會劃盤二四粗砂白、普通現貨十八元八角五分、比前日又小五分、前到首批廣東蔗製粗砂白八百元、昨已由糖業合作公司如數標賣售盤、價爲十八元七角、比荷貨小角半、八九號荷赤現貨叫十三元九角、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元二角半、比前日亦小五分、本廠綿白市勢穏定、一號爲十八元三角、二號十八元一角、三號十七元九角半、四號十七元八角半、　産潮青、聞産價轉平、而此間走塲稍靜、行方觀望少進、號盤仍持原價、致乏成交、</p>
<p>五金　扎鐵用户起恐慌</p>
<p>馬口鐵除原箱正號（即單連雙連）及副號（即會司鐵）外、另有一種扎鐵、故其價格、比原箱便宜、用户因其價廉、多樂於成交、近年來、因烟公司所作之大鐵箱、多採用於此、故其銷路猛進不已、但今年自先令美匯趨漲之後、海外定價步升、同業因其成本較正號貨已差極微、所以多捨扎鐵而定正號貨、來源日見减少、近幾日來、其流通貨竟至斷擋、故用户方面、大起恐慌、標準每扎開漲至二十五元角、（二百磅算）比前好起一元光景、聞副號貨二十九元五角、（二百磅美會司鐵）正號貨三十三元、（九十磅雙連美馬口鐵）以此用户方面不得不改用副號貨、聞其新貨、於本月内尚有一二批可到、故用户多設法抛進、聞已開出四十餘噸、其價每扎估二十六元二角半、又比前高出七角半云、</p>

<h3>留學生赴日與僑胞被逐</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>近來我國赴日留學生漸漸增多，據説原因爲中日匯兌降低外，中日間感情漸呈融洽也不無若干關係。這不能不説是一個很好的現象。因爲中日間感情旣漸呈融洽，中日親善的前途便可樂觀。另一方面我國有志上進的莘莘學子，也得乘這機會負笈東渡，安心讀書。</p>
<p>然而世事總是如此滑稽。近來報紙上，一方面不時登刋着我國留日學生增多的消息，他方面又每天告訴我們我國旅日被逐難僑抵滬的新聞。而且我國旅日僑胞之被逐歸國者，截至今日（十四日）止，已有廿六批之多。并聞將來接踵而回者，繼第廿六批之後，尚有第廿七批，第廿八，·····等批。</p>
<p>我在這裏把這兩件事丨留學生赴日和難僑歸國丨排在一塊來作對照，並不是説旅日僑胞之所以被逐，原因爲留日學生之增多；或留日學生之所以增多，係旅日僑胞被逐的結果。我所不解的是；中日間感情旣漸呈融洽，留日學生增多是當然的；但爲什麽旅日僑胞又會被逐回國呢？難道中日間感情融和是只能惠及留學生而已，而僑胞則反而要遭難？要不是有留日學生逐漸增多這事實可作證明，單從旅日僑胞被逐回國這件事上看，我們不但不敢相信中口間感情已呈融洽，甚至反而要疑心到中日間感情，又日趨破裂了。</p>
<p>然而世間總没有没有原因的事實存在。我在努力試探尋着這兩件事情的原因之下，終於恍然大悟了。原來所謂留學生，所謂僑胞，雖一様是中國人，可是他們却是兩種不同的人物。他們不同之點在什麽地方呢？就在這裏；留學生是消費者，是由祖國帶着許多許多雪亮的白銀要到日本去花費；僑胞是在生産者，有時不免會從日本匯寄若干日金回祖國來安家。前一種人於日人是有利，後一種人於日人就有損了。</p>
<p>這便是日人歡迎我留學生，而驅逐我僑胞的道理。</p>
<h3>日浪人開店質少女</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>前日本報天津電，唐山日浪人所開質店甚多，均以重利盤剥，十三日有玉田難民夫婦，携一女，年僅二十，容貎殊美，因出關無路費，爲日質店主所見，誘令以二十元代價，質當一月，月利二元，書有合同，如取贖時，并須償還飯食等費。此段新聞，却是質店中之别開生面者，可見日人之重利盤剥，異想天開，眞是無微不至，此事雖屬關係甚小，而</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>其發生影　甚　，我　　，萬一男　的父母，少了川資，是否亦當，若只當女子而不當男子，這是何故？萬一老太婆少了路費，是否亦當，倘然只當少女，而不當老婦，只是何故？</p>
<p>就只以少女言之，我便發生幾點感想，（一）質店申而收當少女，是視少女和貨物同一看待，其賤視華人的心理，可以表見，（二）質當一月，而收利二元，若質當一年，必須二十四元，是利率高於當本矣，（三）卽以一月言之，加利旣有二元，若再加以飯食等費，而並未言明價格，可以隨意勒索，卽使索價並不過高，一月飯食之費，亦須四五元，則當者安有能力以取贖，（四）被當者又是一成年貎美女子，萬一店主無行，穢其貞潔，則此賬又何從算起。</p>
<p>故我認爲此種事實，名爲收當少女，其實是收賣少女，因爲一則如此高利率，當者必無能力以取贖，二則青年貎美女子，當入店中，無絶對的保障也，惟再進一步，而推求此事的本質，則又在於我國富有的同胞，因爲我國的人，對於困難同胞，不加憐惜，不爲之設法維持，於是不得已而受日浪人的舞弄，此其咎又不在於日人矣，尚何責於日人。</p>
<h3>流浪者</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>瓦斯燈的慘白的光，在巷角跳躍着，雨點在那白光下，好像碎玻璃似的散落下來，這時已經約莫有十一點多鐘了，馬路上還有一二聲汽車的汽笛在嚮着，但那聲音是很幽沉的，在這寂靜的深巷裏，是幾乎聽不見了。這時李阿大他却還獨自一個的躺在那慘白光下的一個角落裏，喘着微弱的氣息。一陣陣夾着雨點的風撲到他的身上，他的牙齒就格格格的相擊着，身體不住的顫抖着。雖然他想爬起來走動走動，但他那已經没有了氣力的四肢，怎様掙扎還是抬不起來，似乎有着千斤重量的東西壓下着，動一動也是不可能的。</p>
<p>李阿大自從前幾天就病倒了，本來是極微小的病，但這在他却好像是發了大病，他那受了飢餓的肚子，那受了寒冷的身體，使他的病更加的沉得起來。他屢想去吃一點藥，但他却怎様去想辦法也弄不到一點錢，昨天他餓得再也忍不下去了，他還盡力的走起路來，但結果他只從林麻子那裏拿來了二隻爛饅頭，一直的就到了現在，他雖然已經餓得發昏了幾次，冷得全身都僵了，可是他已是再也不能抬起身來了。</p>
<p>他這時眼睛糢糊的望着那瓦斯燈的慘白的光，他那蒙着一層黑色的灰塵的臉，却也顯得更加的慘白了，他的呼吸漸漸地低微下去，在他的腦子裏就浮現出他那在今年大旱時，餓死了的母親和弟弟的臉孔來。他的衰弱的神經突然的感到一陣火様的熱，他不省人事的昏過去了。</p>
<p>李阿大本來他是一個種田的人，他在村裏是以忠實著名的，雖然他今年只有二十來歲，但他自從十四歲時父親死後，他就去給人僱做長工了，一連的十多年，他從没有休息過。但是今年，四處都大旱了，李阿大雖然忠實可靠，但也没有人來僱他去做長工了，他那做人家媽子的母親也被人家辭了，他那十五歲的弟弟，小生意也没做了，一家三口，都是每天在借貸來過活　起初村裏人都因他們一家三人都是老實人，也就借了一點給他，可是漸漸地，借得太多了，别人也没辦法了，他們一家三口也就只好挨着餓的度日。就在這時，他弟弟生了病，這病完全是受了餓來的，但是却因此一病就死了，他那五十歲的老母親，一方因他弟弟死了，一方因受不了餓，也就病倒，而相繼不到十多天就死了。在這時李阿大他對這鄉村是再也没法住下去，所以他就和着村裏林麻子等幾個，一同流落到這大都市的上海來。可是到了這裏之後，他們五六人都謀不到了生路，大家就終日在這街頭流浪，變成一羣無家可歸的流浪者了。</p>
<p>（噲，阿大，起來吧，找了你大半天，你却躺在這兒呢。）</p>
<p>李阿大這時昏沉沉地聽見有人呌他，他慢慢地無力地睜開了那無神色的眼睛，他這時才知道他還未有死去，他旁邊坐着林麻子在發抖着。</p>
<p>（你餓嗎？劉三哥就要來了。他去想辦法，我們等着他拿來給你吃吧！）</p>
<p>林麻子牙齒相繫着的説，但這在李阿大看來，恐怕他再也没有福氣吃劉三拿來的東西了。他苦着臉，呆望着林麻子，一句話也説不出的哼着。</p>
<p>時候是在飛速的過去，天已經是快亮，那雨雖是停了，但西北風刮到人的身上是更加的寒冷了。這時劉三和劉二他們兄弟二人才從那巷外走進來，但當他兩人走近的時候，只看見林麻子呆呆的在那裏流着涙，瓦斯燈的慘白光輝照到他的臉上，只是白色的，一點血也没有。他看他兩人走來，低低的説；</p>
<p>（我們又少了一個同伴了。）</p>
<p>劉三和劉二聽到了這句話，望着那躺在角落裏再也不能動了的李阿大，默默地站住着。</p>
<h3>番邦</h3>
<p>— 沁</p>
<p>約莫在三數十年前，人們會以爲番邦是不毛之地。然而，從南洋發財的華僑，日更日多的時候，人們都又羨慕番邦是像黄金的天國似的。</p>
<p>童年時候，吃了番客們歸鄉的番餅，看他們穿着黑綢衫褲，番邦是多麽美麗可愛！心裏深深的印着這些夢痕。但却没有知道番邦，丨丨鄉俗意指南洋。原是類似蠻夷居處，全是中國的南方人，冐險而去，日漸開發的。當初航運還未見很發達，海路也尚未通航，廣東福建等地的人們，富有冐險和勇敢的性質，大膽的飄着很易沉没的大木船而去，中途致死，和到了番邦，因水土不服，蠻地不易居而死的，眞不知多少。就是二十年前，鄉中算是過番的人較多，也還視爲可怕的陌生地呢！富貴人家的子弟，誰也不願放他過番，大半是一些浪盪子弟，不大容於家鄉，只好走番邦。就是在南洋華僑們最隆旺的時候，過番邦的人們，仍是十分辛苦的。</p>
<p>背鄉離井，抛妻棄子，而走番邦，在故土觀念最深的中國人看來，是最淒凉的事情。就説到較近的越南吧，找到快二十塊錢路費，又需要十多元的入口費，更一定要凖備繳第一年三十多塊的人頭稅。這一筆過番的大資本，時常是要辛苦的生借來的；甚至於有的賣牛　子。嫁寡嫂，賣女兒。而想去番帮謀生。另了眷仿的故鄉。懷着滿腹的離愁。到　海邊，看那渺無天際之的綠水滔滔</p>
<h3>不識寶者</h3>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，這些大部分是鄉下人的新過番的，心已先寒酸酸的了。</p>
<p>好容易，船渡過了七洲洋，海水由綠變成黑，又從黑轉變成綠了。一帆風順的話，也已受了不少旅途的痛苦，幾日夜的艙底的生活，當然不是好過的。</p>
<p>船安然的入港，抵番邦的岸口了。但是並不能隨意登陸，站在甲板上等着，給熱帶的太陽光煎着，不知要等了幾個鐘頭，才准許爬上番邦的陸地。也不能自由的就走，仍是要等着。行李是不准卽帶走，須拿進衣箱亭去受檢查，等到一切入口手續辦清後，才可以到衣箱亭去領取。領取回來的東西缺不缺，那只好聽命運。受了踢打又要花了角子，才能好好的把東西領到手，這也算是一個難關。</p>
<p>把行李放進衣箱亭，人須被像猪般驅入新客衙。命運好的話，番人卽日辦公，給你辦清入口手續。一定要有商家担保才得住下。入口紙，入頭稅紙，一槪繳後辦清，才得放出新客衙。像犯人似的要打了幾次手印，番人簽了字，領到一張人頭稅紙。這紙必需每行必帶，不然查到時，先抓去坐牢後再説。丢掉了那就等於没有繳過一様，重新再繳，費錢又很麻煩。如船抵岸時，逢到番人不辦公，那就活給關在新客衙過夜，没有吃也没有地方睡，比坐牢還苦。平安的辦手續時，遭受到意外的踢打，那是十分平常的事。</p>
<p>算是安全的出了新客衙，和暫時找到了地方住。但職業是否就找得到，也是一個是够苦惱的問題。失業的滋味，用不着多説。縱有了工作，那華僑店裏的夥計並不易當。工作是没有限定多少小時，除了睡吃的時間以外，全部是幾乎盡賣給了老板。娛樂和開心處，簡直難以找，只老愛憂思的掛念着故鄉吧了。</p>
<p>生疏之地，有病時，店裏是斷不容得病夥計白拿薪，辭退了送到每家醫院去待死。如果要回去，那也不可以自由的走，一定要先在四十天前報告政府及繳好幾塊錢出口紙費，查得别無他故，才准放行。番邦，像一座陌生無情的囚籠呵！</p>
<h3>個人的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>先前藴藏在腦子裏的什麽錦繡的理想和柔輕的夢念，一經磁着了慘酷的遭逢，就如同一杯貯滿紅色的葡萄酒的柸子碰着了岩石似的，一下子全粉碎了。如今是一切的空想念頭都没有，如今我唯一的希望，是天天在後邊緊追着我的，彷彿一雙可怕的生活猛獸能放鬆了一下，不再拚命的追趕，使我可以定一定恐慌的情緒，狂跳的心，停一停跑累的腿子，而讓我舒一口氣休息一回。可是這是可能的嗎？不可能的，我的雙腿如若走得稍爲遲緩，那野獸似的生活就快撲上身來，差點兒都給當一嘴點心呑下肚子裏去了。</p>
<p>于是，我祇好掙扎着最後的氣力喘息地一直向前奔，連頭亦不敢回的。</p>
<p>生活眞是一隻猛獸似的呵！它不停地給我以種種恐懼威嚇，張着惡狠的眼睛窺伺着我，瞧我一個不留神解决了我。爲了此，不得不日日支持着瘦弱的身體，從清晨至深夜，伏在一個霉而窄的小屋子裏，殘忍地向腦袋極盡桃剔的能事，攤開稿紙一行行從腦裏輸到筆尖，又從筆尖沙沙地寫到紙面上。</p>
<p>吃自已心血的人啊；投了筆，這様太息着。</p>
<p>精神已經困倦非躺一躺不可了，然而還是得睜開累到流水的眼皮繼續在紙上一字字塗下去。有時病着，仍然必要負着病的痛楚在稿紙上勞作着，除非到了眼底生花頭昏腦眩爲止。每當寫完了一篇稿，再從頭讀一遍，我的心就不由地整個劇痛起來，像突然受到鐵槌子重重打擊了一頓一様。這裏邊是塗着自已無數鮮紅的血和斑爛的涙跡呵！常在靜寂的深夜裏的燈光下，搬出了許多存稿，隨意翻看着，有時便想起早些日子一種可笑的心境來了，那時，我曾經把它當做精神的蘇息地，當作心靈無上的寄托，甚而至於當做生的孤單的旅程上唯一的伴侣，珍重地把它藏在行篋，像珍重一件心愛的東西似的，隨着我經過許多地方，長長的時間伴着我，幾乎不願離開，在寂寞的旅舍中，長夜無法排遣，往往就打開行篋把它們翻出來，愉快地鑑賞，覺得這些是心靈之花的結晶，有着無限的榮耀，於是一種美妙的慰安的情調緩緩地充滿了整個的心窩，差不多要陶醉於這種精神的慰安中了。可是這種可笑的心境已早就跟夢念和理想一齊消滅了。</p>
<p>現在怎様呢？我看了它們我的手便發抖，心亦在痛，而且憤怒着，把它們看做我生的最大的仇敵，再不是什麽心靈上的寄托，生的伴侣。在那裏邊，都曾渲染過我許多的血痕，許多的涙痕。它們像一條毒虫，在無形中嚙瘦着我的青春，蠶食着我的生命。還有什麽情感，我只有痛恨，憎惡，當我憤仇達於極點的時間，我幾乎想燃一把火一股腦兒把它們燒成灰。不讓其再出現於眼前，因爲一看了它們，便會不期然而然地回想起從前的種種情形，覺得變得太迅速了，這様我將感到無限的悲哀。</p>
<p>所存在於如自已一様的人的光榮，尤其是當見到了别人對於自已的熱切的讚詞，或是看見了自已的東西那種慰撫和歡忭，在我是一絲也不存在的。我只知道多一趟在紙上作息，我的淔血又多挹注了幾許，同時生命卽上一步的挨近墓墳的邊沿。因此我全不希冀當我眼睛閉了，呼吸停止了以後，有什麽人來到我的墓前，一面誦讀我的詩篇，一方宣述我生前的行跡。我惟是期求能够就此永遠與那些分了手，或者可以多活一些時日，可是這無人知的悲劇不到最後的一天是不會完幕的。</p>

<h3>克勞黛考爾白的和一個奇特的影迷的通訊（上）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>那是可能的嗎？一個明星和一個影迷發生了特别的感情？世界上喜歡看影戲的人，大都喜歡和他們所喜歡看的電影明星通通信。但是在明星們的一方面呢？是不是他們會從千萬影迷之中，檢出一兩個特别的人，而和他們發生特殊的情感的呢？是不是他們會從千萬封影迷信扎之中，檢出幾封特殊的，與衆同的，而在明星們的心坎裏佔着一個特殊　的優越的地位的呢？</p>
<p>照普通的事實而論，那差不多是不可能的。無論你的信，寫得多末動人，但亦不過是千萬之中的一個。有些特别和普通的影迷信兩様些，但是每天收到的信是那末多，明星們和你又没有見過面，怎能對於你發生特殊的情感呢？但是克勞黛考爾白（Ciandettecolbert），却是常道中的一個例外。她是有一個眞心心愛的影迷的。</p>
<p>有一次，她和一位新聞記者談着話。起初，她似乎很急乎將這件事告訴他。可是她忽然又頻頻搖着頭。她怎好意思講出來呢？她忽然地又嚇了人一跳。她突然仰着頭大笑起來。過了一回，她連忙告罪道；（請你原諒我。我每次想起了這件事怎様起頭的，我就禁不住要笑起來。起頭，我並不覺得有趣。我很覺得有氣，但是現在······我想着就會失聲而知的）。</p>
<p>（他叫什麽名字哩？）那位新聞記者問着。</p>
<p>克勞黛對着那記者凝視着，她一時回答不出來。她忽然嘴一撇，露出一種頑皮的笑容。次則她突然跳了起來，奔出了會客室。一回兒，她拿了一大包的信回來了。她微笑着坐了下來，將綑信的綠紗帶解了開來，然後説道；（那個人我是很熟悉的。我就是將他的名字宣佈了，或則他亦不見得怪我的。（她説着，就將第一封信抽了出來道；（你自已去看好了。）</p>
<p>那位記者讀着那封信。署的名字是但尼爾葛克，一個男子的名字。裏面那影迷送給了克勞黛考爾白一個電影脚本。當然，克勞黛是没有工夫去讀不相識的人，送來的脚本的。她定了這個章程，囑咐了她的秘書，凡是外面有人送脚本來，就不必通知她，寫封謝信去退還。這次她的秘書，却破了例，拿着那影迷的信，和他所寫的電影脚本，給她去看。克勞黛那天辛苦了一整天，心緒很不好，聽了她的話，立即跳了起來，責備她的秘書，説她不懂規矩。但是她的秘書，却説那脚本特别的好。這一下子，克勞黛更發怒起來，她將脚本擲在地下，將她的秘書趕了出去。</p>
<p>等到她的秘書出去了，她在無意之中，又拾起那脚本來翻着。她在末一頁，發現了一行小字，寫的是；（不知考爾白小姐看不看這個東西，誰曉得呢？）克勞黛就走到寫字檯上，自已親筆覆了他一封信，上面没有别的話，祇有（誰曉得？）三個字。也寫完了，將信附在脚本裏，寄還了那位葛克先生。她以爲這一下子，一切都完了。</p>
<p>可是過了幾天，她又收到那影迷的一封信，裏面祇寫着相類的三個字，就是）上帝曉得。（</p>
<p>克勞黛覺得這三個字很有趣，並且簡單得很，她就信筆又寫了一封回信，裏面寫的是；（上帝到底有没有呢？）又過了幾天，她又收到一封回信，裏面祇有一個字，就有；）多疑者。）</p>
<p>克勞黛一時高興，又復了他一封信，裏面説的是；）你自命是文學家，眞是大言不慚。（多疑者）的後面，連一句話完結的一點都忘了。）（未完）</p>

<h3>評（新戀舊愛）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｂlinddate丨國泰</p>
<p>男女間的戀愛，在美國電影作家的觀念中，常是非常神秘的超越經濟，或者其他一切的界限，富家少爺，會和貧窮的女子結婚，而工人出身的青年，也常會得着高貴的女郎青睞，結論是戀愛原爲神秘不可思議的。而且這也是他們作品中所主要表現的東西。但是我們所通常看到的並非如此。關於這一點，記得在英國出品的（自立之道）中解釋得非常明白，廠主的兒子和女工的一時的戀愛是有的，爲了一時的需要，但是她們之間，因着經濟和地位的不同，到底是不能結合的。</p>
<p>不過我們不會忽視，他們如此創作的觀念形態的，譬如説在這（新戀舊愛）中，劇作者充分的表現富少年的仁慈，大量爲她購贈華貴的服裝，他重厚的資助情人及她所眷戀的人。這裏迎合了一般向上爬的心理，其説謊的作用，也太明顯了。</p>
<p>從這裏來觀察，（新戀舊愛）應當怎様估價，用不着再加解釋，不過就表現的形像來説，這裏頗有可愛的地方，如寫凱娣的家庭，她的弟妹們是不停的爭吵，她的父親和母親的個性是那末活躍，那些人物，眞是太典型的舊式家庭。這裏給與人們質樸的歡笑，就因着如此可愛的表現，給與人們不少好感。</p>
<p>至谥演員們都很盡職，特别是飾母親和父親的更爲見佳。不平凡的技巧，表現了平凡的内容。</p>

<h3>相逢待嫁（Forsaking　all　Others）（六）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>傑弗雷説道；（他打了一個電報給我，説是天晚上結的婚。）曼麗的嘴唇顫動着，但是還强作笑容道；（他·····他在電報裏一定説對不起我的，是不是？）傑弗雷點着頭道；（是的）。曼麗道；（那還好。總算他有良心，　　電報給我。可受的迭倫，無論在什麽地方，他總　住我的。）伊琳諾爾看着她怪可憐的，就　她坐下來休息一回。可是曼麗，帶着可憐的聲音説道；（爲什麽坐下？新娘是應當站着的。你看見過坐着結婚的嗎？不興！坐着結婚是不興的！你應當站在神壇前面。等結婚完了！還要吻着新郎。不過現在却還有新郎可吻了！他已經和康妮巴尼司結了婚了·····）她的聲音！越説壏高起來。最後她雙手捧着頭哭起來了。</p>
<p>曼麗此後，過了許多悲慘的日子。她換了一個鄉下地方住着木頭，在湖裏游着水，騎着馬，站到身體疲倦到極度了，晚上睡不着覺。她知道她一定要忘記一切已往。無庸向着石頭心跳了。這様，經過了多少時候，她的一顆破碎的心，才漸漸重新修補起來，才漸漸覺得日落的美麗，是用不着迭倫的存在的，才漸漸覺得冷水打在黄皮膚上的樂趣，才漸漸曉得一個人生活着，和康健的有意味。</p>
<p>後來傑弗雷和歇伯亦來了，更使她快樂歡欣起來。傑弗雷還帶來了許多信件。他們在飯後，於是聚在一起拆信看，他們一共四個人，曼麗，葆拉，傑弗雷和歇伯。曼麗忽然手裏拿着一封信，對着傑弗雷道；（傑弗雷，你聽着這個；）她於是讀着那封信道；（久别之後，正圖歡聚。余等於本月八日晚九時，在庽洗樽茶候大駕。望不吝玉趾，惠然來臨是盼。）下面署着（康妮。迭倫林達）幾個字。傑弗雷聽了，祗答應了一個唔字。可是曼麗説道；）八號就是後天。我明天進城去，第一様要做的事，就是把頭髮曼一下。第二様是·····）傑弗雷覺得奇怪道；（曼麗·····你想去嗎？）曼麗道；（當然去咯。）傑弗雷站了起來，走到曼麗的面前，在她脚底下一張小凳子上坐了下來，然後説道；（曼麗，你糊塗了嗎？你一定不知道那是什</p>
<p>麽用意。那女人不過是要羞辱你一下罷了。你對於那種事，還一些準備没有哩。快不要去上她的當。）可是曼麗搖着頭道；（我想康妮是不要我去的。但是我們竟去了。看她怎麽様，好不好？再則我已經好了，我都記不清迭倫的眼睛是什麽様子的，他有没有鼻子的。我還怕他們什麽？）</p>
<p>到了那天，曼麗果然同着弗雷，到迭倫的庽所裏去了。她在飯後，在花園裏遇見了迭倫。他們就一同散着步，細細的音樂傳了過來，室内暗澹的燈光，散佈在地上。曼麗是一些防備都没有。迭倫冷不防地樓住了曼麗，狠命他吻着她，一次一地訴説着他的愛，並且自已承認着他的錯誤，以及現的悔恨。曼麗推開他，但是迭倫死命不放她走。他哀求着道；（曼麗，你一定要聽我的話。現在已是談不到誰對誰錯了。現在惟一的問題，就是我是始終愛你的·····）正在這難分難解的時候，康妮突然出現了。很顯然地，她是有願定的計劃的，是·····（未完）</p>

<h3>Yutian Troops Clash Violently</h3>
<p>Lin Nancang Town Briefly Site of Street Fighting</p>
<p>The Essence of the Entire Town Destroyed by Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Wang Bingxiao's Troops Retreat to Yanshan Pass</p>
<p>Feng Shoupeng's Troops in Active Pursuit</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the rebellion of Wang Bingxiao's Yutian Republic troops, the Security Corps under Feng Shoupeng quelled the situation. They have now retreated to Yanshan Pass and other areas on the border of Ji County and Yutian County. The Security Corps is continuing its pursuit and suppression. In order to resolve this issue, Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin this morning to meet with Yu Xuezhong to request instructions on everything. After reaching a result through consultation, he will return to Peiping within days. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the looting of Lin Nancang Town, there was no one at the market on the 14th. The great fire was only extinguished in the afternoon of the 14th. Due to the lack of rescue, the essence of the entire town was burned. The corpses of town police and civilians were scattered throughout the town, with no one to collect them. The scene was extremely tragic. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A portion of the Yuhong Bridge militia retreated towards the border of Ji County. On the 15th, they arrived at Xin'an Town. Due to obstruction by the Ji County Security Tunnels, they retreated towards Yanshan Pass to regroup. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin from Peiping regarding the clash between Wang Bingxiao's Yutian troop militia and the Security Corps under Feng Shoupeng. He immediately met with Chairman Yu to present a request for a decision on how to handle the situation. He returned to Peiping at 4:00 PM that day and will go to Tongzhou to mediate nearby. (16th Dispatch)  (Tianjin)  The Yutian troop conflict occurred while Zhu Shiqin was bedridden in Peiping and unable to go and mediate. The provincial government notified Yin Rugeng, who was in Peiping, by telephone to quickly handle the situation, temporarily halt the conflict, and then think of ways for the aftermath.  The underlying cause of the Yutian militia and Security Corps conflict is that the troops had deep-seated resentment. The recent cause was that Feng Shoupeng, the special team leader of the Security Corps, fabricated accusations that the militia commander Wang Bingxiao cruelly killed Japanese people and was arrested by the Tangshan military. Wang held great resentment and thought of revenge day and night. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 15th, Yutian Yahong Bridge Town was surrounded by Sun Yucheng, commander of the Security Supplementary Team. Most of the militia stationed in the town had already retreated with Wang Bingxiao to Yanshan Pass on the border of Ji and Yutian counties. The Security Corps under Feng Shoupeng continued to pursue relentlessly. Fierce fighting had already broken out on the border of Ji and Yutian counties on the evening of the 15th. The Ji Province government has now received a report and has telegraphed Fan Jingyang's First Regiment of the Ji County Security Corps to rush to the border to block the escape of the troops. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to information from Yutian, the truth of the troop conflict is that during the morning market in Lin Nancang Town on the 13th, about 350 militiamen from Wang Bingxiao's unit, led by Section Chief Li Weizhou, suddenly infiltrated the town, wearing red ribbons on their lapels and concealing guns. They first surrounded the Chamber of Commerce defense post and disarmed them, then went to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau and disarmed the police. The head of the branch, Jia Shaoqing, escaped through the back door. The 70-plus members of the Special Forces stationed in the town, under Feng Shoupeng, engaged in street fighting with the militia. After three hours, they were outnumbered, with four killed and the rest disarmed. Upon receiving the report, Feng Shoupeng led his troops to assist Sun Yucheng, the commander of the First Battalion, to rescue, trapping the militia in the town. Using mortars and machine guns, they launched a fierce attack on the town, causing more than a hundred houses in the town to be destroyed by fire. Men and women cried out in shock. The standoff lasted until 8 p.m., when the troops were overwhelmed and suffered heavy casualties. Li Weizhou led a breakout and retreated to Linxi Village west of the town. Feng then led his troops in pursuit, and they retreated to Yanshan Pass. Wang Bingxiao himself is said to be still holed up in Yahong Bridge. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Zuo Zhou Denies</h3>
<p>Discord Among Changli and Luan County Troops</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese sources claim that cracks have appeared between the Changli and Luan County militias and the First Regiment of the War Zone Security Corps, creating instability. Today, the Ji Province government received a telegram from Liu Zuozhou, the commander of the Security Corps, reporting that there was no such thing. The militia and security team are very harmonious and have made tight arrangements for winter defense, assisting each other in case of incidents. The Japanese propaganda may have a purpose and should not be believed. Japanese and Korean residents in Changli and Luan County organized volunteer corps. On the 15th, each held an establishment ceremony. Ochiai and Kawai, the captains of the Japanese troops in Shanhaiguan, sent personnel to attend the ceremony. The Changli volunteer</p>
<p>corps consists of thirty members, and Luan County consists of forty, each with retired soldiers as training officers. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to transportation circles, more than 150 Japanese guards stationed in Yuguan, using the excuse of the Changli security team rioting, traveled from Yu to Changli. However, the Changli security team sent letters to all parties denying any rioting. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Destroyed Labin Road</h3>
<p>A Foreign Military Train Overturned and Attacked</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to news from outside the pass, the railroad tracks between Wuchang and Lalin on the Labin Road were destroyed by guerrillas on the 2nd of this month. A foreign military train traveling in the area was overturned. The guerrillas then launched a surprise attack, raining down bullets. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. The siege was lifted only after reinforcements arrived. (16th, China Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Luan Dong Mining Area</h3>
<p>Five Traitors Captured</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xizhe, son of Zhang Haipeng, the puppet Rehe garrison commander, sent his henchmen Biao Rui Tong, Lin Guoan, Zhao Wengong, Rong Zhonghe, and Wang Fengqi to secretly operate in the Kailuan Five Mines in Luan Dong. Biao rented a house in Erdaojie, Majiagou Mine as a secret den. Zhao falsely set up a shadow garden, secretly contacting the three to plot wrongdoing. On the 14th, the Fifth Branch of the mining area detected the plot and arrested the five criminals, seizing a secret letter from Zhang with words such as going to Tianjin to recruit soldiers in order to quickly reach the required number. After interrogation, the five criminals confessed to their rebellious conspiracy. They have been sent to Tangshan for delivery to the Peiping Military Branch for trial. (16th Dispatch)</p>

(4) Approved 17 budget cases. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tan Zhen Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 16th and attended the Central Political Conference immediately. According to him, his illness has not yet healed. He originally intended to go north to inspect the judiciary, but the date is undetermined. It may be possible after the spring warms up. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>Receptions After Arriving in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Beijing, Wang Chonghui went to his old residence on Tongren Street from his residence in the Mausoleum New Village at 9:00 AM on the 16th to rest and meet with old friends in Beijing. At noon, Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, hosted a banquet for Wang at his private residence and invited Xie Guansheng and others to accompany him. Wang is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 18th. (16th Dispatch) (Nanjing) In order to convey central government decrees and communicate local conditions, the Guangdong military and political authorities appointed Guan Suren, Li Renren, and Deng Qingyang as permanent representatives in Beijing. Guan and Li have been appointed as legislators. Li stayed in Guangdong due to matters. He can come to Beijing next week. Guan has attended the preparatory meeting of the Legislative Yuan and has gone to Shanghai to meet Deng Qingyang, who is in Shanghai. They are scheduled to come to Beijing on the 17th to attend the first general meeting of the Legislative Yuan. Since the three committees also have the mission of liaison, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside, in addition to important items, they will visit the authorities at any time for contact. Ordinary events will still be conveyed by Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, and no other offices will be established. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>Interprets Doubts in Civil Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huanggang District Court asked the Judicial Yuan to interpret various doubts regarding the abolition of adoption and the dissolution of marriage contracts. The explanation is that for the abolition of inheritance events that occur after the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code, since there is no law to follow, Article 1 of the General Principles of the Civil Code should be followed and the legal provisions for terminating the adoption relationship between adoptive parents and children should be adopted as a legal principle. Second, if a minor child does not agree to a marriage contract entered into by their parents on their behalf, the marriage contract is naturally invalid and there is no issue of dissolution. Instructions were given on the 16th to comply. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Guoguang Speaks on</h3>
<p>Future Bandit Suppression Strategies</p>
<p>Consolidate Steadily and Strike Fiercely to Eliminate the Main Force of Bandits</p>

(2) Rewards and punishments must be clear, and the various armies must coordinate their actions. (3) The hearts of the people are the prerequisite for the hearts of the military. Bandit suppression troops must cherish the people in order to win their hearts. If we win the support of the people, the hearts of the military will be solid. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang and Yang Bochang, the chief of staff of the training division, flew to Luzhou on the 16th to address the garrison troops of Fan and Zhang's brigades. They returned to Chongqing on the same day. Pan Wenhua, the division commander, led his subordinates to Luzhou by steamer on the same day to inspect the defenses and stationed there. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The new provincial government will be established on the 20th. He Chengjiao, who was sent by the Central Government to supervise the oath-taking, and Yang Quanyu, the new Director of Education, will fly to Chongqing on the 18th. The Chongqing Administrative Office has determined that the city library, Shuangyuan, Shizhong Building, and the new guesthouse will be used for residence. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Hou Zidan came to Chongqing from Songkan on the 12th to pay respects to Liu Xiang and He Guoguang and request instructions. He arrived in Chongqing on the 16th and will return to the defense area on the 23rd. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Wang Youyong, the second chief of the General Staff, took the early train on the morning of the 16th to Xun and then took a boat to Hankou. He will fly to Chongqing with Deputy Chief Li Weilun when the opportunity arises. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yang Bandits Have a Tendency to Flee to Shaanxi</h3>

County Magistrate Liang Weixin led more than 200 policemen to suppress them. They encountered the bandits in Huangyan Village and engaged in a two-hour fierce battle. The bandits were defeated and fled towards Shuangxian and Tangjiakou. After further pursuit, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled to Zijing Pass that night, reportedly entering the territory of Shanxi. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yellow River Silt Land Plan</h3>
<p>(Jinan) According to a survey by the Construction Department, the water surface of the Yellow River from Rongze to Lijin is 3-4 meters higher than the ground outside the dikes, making it most suitable for siphon silt land.

The project cost is agreed at 5 million yuan, and a charge of 6 jiao per mu is sufficient. The remaining clear water after siltation can increase the water volume of various rivers, and North China shipping can receive great benefits. Moreover, the German Engels plan to comprehensively treat the Yellow River in 30 years, requiring a total of 34.8 million yuan. A donation of 5 jiao per mu per year from the silted land is enough to use. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: Difficulties in the Textile Industry and the Issue of Raw Cotton Taxation</h3>
<p>Since it was reported that a certain Central Committee member advocated saving the nation's yarn factories, the clamor about how difficult the textile industry is has become quite noisy again. As commercial customs coincide with the time of year-end settlement, some domestic factories with slightly weaker financial strength are indeed in a state of suspension and reorganization due to the impact of the sluggish market. Even yarn factories with relatively strong strength on weekdays inevitably suffer from the pain of cheap yarn and expensive cotton. Coupled with the decline of the national economy in recent years, the difficulties have deepened day by day. Under this situation, how will the national textile industry tide over this difficulty? It is indeed worthy of our deep consideration.</p>
<p>After silently observing the various statements made by all parties to rescue the yarn industry in recent days, it seems that their sights are all focused on the single point of cheap yarn and expensive cotton, believing that it is useless unless the value of raw cotton (i.e., the cost of raw materials) is reduced. The intention of promoting this statement is probably that the price of standard yarn has fallen to more than 180 yuan, while the price of raw cotton has become increasingly expensive due to hoarding and manipulation. As a result, the cost of each piece of yarn far exceeds the price of the yarn. In order to suppress the price of cotton, there is a saying that the current import tariff on raw cotton should be reduced. It seems reasonable to say this, but as far as I know, the expensiveness of cotton is not the fundamental difficulty of the yarn industry, and it is even more doubtful whether reducing the import tariff on raw cotton can immediately achieve the effect of cheap cotton. My country is known as an agricultural country, although cotton production cannot completely meet demand. However, under the slogan of national recovery and the revitalization of rural areas in recent years, the cotton planting industry seems to have become the main agricultural investment of the banking industry. The gradual progress of cotton production towards a bumper harvest is indeed a very obvious benefit and cannot be denied as a great thing. Because it is the phenomenon that should occur after the revitalization of rural areas. Moreover, what cannot be ignored is that since the current tariff rules were promulgated in July 1934, the import tax rate on raw cotton has been 5 gold units per 100 kilograms, which is 43% heavier than the originally set tariff rule of 3.5 gold units. At that time, people in the country generally believed that foreign factories, such as Japanese merchants, which consumed the most foreign cotton in the country, would inevitably suffer a great blow. Chinese factories could take advantage of this opportunity to compete favorably. This is why Japanese factories expressed their opposition to the increase in tariffs on raw cotton. Although this matter has passed, if our people today advocate increasing the import of foreign cotton for the sake of temporary interests and in order to suppress domestic cotton, I am afraid that the final result will only be laughed at by foreign merchants. If it is said that the price of cotton can be lowered as a result, it is very unlikely. It must be known that the current trend of cotton prices towards expensiveness is due to the impact of the severe drought in the United States last year and is completely based on the principle of supply and demand changes in the international market, which cannot be manipulated by the tariff rules of a single country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I must fully recognize the fundamental difficulties of yarn factories today, which are nothing more than the backwardness of production efficiency and the oppression of foreign capital. The former belongs to the issue of production costs, while the latter is the market protection policy of a so-called independent country, which cannot be ignored. If you want to revitalize the domestic textile industry at this time of increasing global competition, I am afraid that there is no other special and effective plan besides this fundamental rescue method. If you only know how to solve problems from the trivial matters, it will not only have the suspicion of going back and forth, but it is also not the original intention of the Chinese people to seek self-salvation.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Postpones Saar Issue Meeting, Causing Complications</h3>
<p>Germany Demands Stipulation of Transfer Date</p>
<p>League of Nations in a Dilemma, Seeking Compromise</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to informed sources, Britain and France requested that the Saar be designated as part of the demilitarized Rhineland, leading to the postponement of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting originally scheduled for today to transfer the Saar to Germany. The Administrative Council announced that many issues concerning the Saar would be resolved during this session, rather than leaving detailed procedures to be handled by a committee. The German side has not expressed any reaction to this new development. It is rumored that any delay will cause resentment throughout Germany, as the German government and people are united in their firm demand for the immediate return of the Saar to the fatherland. Moreover, Germany's demand was resolute even before the vote. Now that the results of the vote have been revealed, with a strong majority of over 90% in favor of returning to Germany, there is no room for further delay in returning the lost territory. Therefore, the demands of Britain and France have placed the League of Nations Administrative Council in a dilemma, as the League wants to resolve the Saar issue immediately without creating unnecessary complications. However, with these demands from the two major powers in the League, the Administrative Council can only follow Britain and France's lead. Since the final resolution of the Saar issue will be delayed, various countries must engage in off-session consultations to reach a compromise acceptable to all parties. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held an important meeting this afternoon to consider the report of the Saar plebiscite commission and postponed making a decision on handing over the Saar to Germany. People in Geneva speculated about the reasons for the temporary postponement. Some sources said that this move was related to the desire expressed by political circles this morning for a generous handover of the Saar, or that technical arrangements had encountered setbacks. However, this postponement will not last long. It is rumored that the Administrative Council may convene again tomorrow. Meanwhile, according to news from Berlin, the German government has made a strong demand to the League of Nations, requesting a fixed date for the return of the Saar and the withdrawal of the international troops stationed there. However, according to official sources, the German Consul General in Geneva, Mr. Krull, did not make any demands when he met with Baron Aloisi today, but made it clear that the Saar should be returned as soon as possible so that the German government could take over the area within a month. Germany now feels that there is no reason to delay the handover, and Germany is now in a position to insist on its rights without having to ask anyone for concessions. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Continued telegram: According to responsible sources, the reason for the Administrative Council's postponement of the decision to hand over the Saar was due to France's raising of the issue of the demilitarization of the Saar. According to Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles, all German territory on the left bank of the Rhine must be demilitarized. France is now demanding the demolition of railways related to military use and the facilities for loading and unloading troop trains. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British sources claim that even with the abolition of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar must be a non-militarized zone. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Various parties are currently conducting talks outside the League of Nations Administrative Council regarding the Saar issue, to find a solution that is satisfactory to both France and Germany. The point of divergence between France and Germany lies in the demilitarization of the Saar region. France believes that the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that the demilitarized zone on the left bank of the Rhine should include the Saar, and that this issue did not need to be raised before the plebiscite decided the fate of the Saar. However, Germany believes that after the plebiscite resulted in a German victory, the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the Saar region no longer have any reason to exist. It is generally believed that this can still be resolved smoothly. Diplomatic talks between various countries are now continuing. This morning, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck to discuss the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Beck is still ill. French Foreign Minister Laval will visit Beck this afternoon. The discussions will cover all aspects of French-Polish relations, the Eastern European Pact, and the Rome agreements between Italy and France. People are very interested in these matters. In addition, Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jevtić will arrive here soon, and British Foreign Secretary Simon will also return here. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British government now advocates for a prompt decision on the timing of the League of Nations Saar Governing Commission's handover of the Saar administration to the German authorities, and also advocates for the prompt withdrawal of the international gendarmerie. The British government's views will be expressed by Foreign Secretary Simon at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. Simon may depart for Geneva tomorrow or Friday. The customs checkpoints currently existing between the Saar and various parts of Germany will be removed. It is currently expected that similar customs checkpoints will be established between the Saar and France, and that arrangements will be made to allow the people of the Saar to exchange francs for German currency. Informed circles in London believe that the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding Germany's demilitarization will naturally apply to the Saar, as the Saar is now part of German territory. France now believes that the result of this vote will strengthen Hitler's position domestically and may further increase the decisiveness of diplomatic affairs. It is feared that the Austrian National Socialist Party will therefore attempt to revive its activities. The Times says that the overall situation should now be handled with extreme caution, and that France, Britain, and Italy should work together to deal with Hitlerized Germany. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting at 4:00 PM today, followed by a formal meeting. The formal meeting will receive the results of the Saar vote and the report of Mr. Weede, Chairman of the Saar Plebiscite Commission. Then, League of Nations President Rüsthi will invite Aloisi to speak. Aloisi will propose that the entire Saar region be returned to Germany immediately. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ballots Arrive in Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) All members of the Saar plebiscite commission, carrying dozens of boxes of ballots, departed from Saarbrücken by special train yesterday and arrived here this afternoon. Senior officials of the League of Nations and representatives of the international press welcomed them, and a large contingent of police was dispatched to protect them. The destruction of these ballots will be decided by the Administrative Council. As for the recount of the ballots, it is generally believed that since such a large majority voted in favor of returning to Germany, there is no need for a recount. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saar Restores to Normal</h3>
<p>(Saarbrücken) The scenery here has returned to normal, but flags can still be seen flying everywhere. The offices of the plebiscite commission and the Saar administrative commission are very quiet, in stark contrast to the lively state of a few days ago. The chairman of the administrative commission, Mr. Knox, went to Geneva by car this morning to inform the League of Nations Administrative Council that the sooner the Saar region is transferred, the better. In the eyes of the residents of the Saar, the authority of the administrative commission has almost been lost due to the results of the plebiscite. If public security is threatened, it will be difficult for the administrative commission to take serious decisions. It is generally believed that Knox will advocate that the transfer of sovereignty should take place on March 1, rather than between March 15 and April 1. Currently, the resettlement movement of anti-National Socialist Saar residents continues, with approximately one thousand people requesting protection from the French consulate every day. Newspapers that support maintaining the status quo have now ceased publication. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germans Celebrate Wildly All Night</h3>
<p>Torchlight Processions Stretch for Miles</p>
<p>Party and National Anthems and Saar Song Harmonize; Mourning Clothes and Coffins Mock the Status Quo</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: The National Socialist Party won a large majority in this vote. Germany and the Saar are both celebrating greatly. All streets in the Saar were decorated with lanterns last night. Tens of thousands of men, women, and children marched through the city holding Chinese lanterns. The processions stretched for miles, and crowds of onlookers watched. When the lantern parades passed, there were cheers, as if everyone was crazy. In addition, there were dozens of military bands and other musical groups gathered in the streets, playing patriotic marches, the German national anthem, party songs, and the Saar song, showing their joy. Shouts of "Long live" rose and fell, never ceasing. A group of young people, dressed in mourning clothes, wearing tall hats, carried a coffin with the inscription "Mr. Bureau is dead" and paraded through the city. The crowds who saw it laughed and cheered wildly. A wreath with the words "You have won" was placed in front of the offices of the labor newspaper, which had predicted that the anti-Hitler faction would win. Such humorous events were too numerous to record. Fortunately, those who were targeted endured it and no incidents occurred. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: The results of the Saar vote have been announced. The celebration that the National Socialist Party called "the festival of the century" was held in the evening. The enthusiasm of the people marching with torches cannot be described in words. At 6:00 PM, a continuous stream of people were marching, perhaps as many as 200,000. Observations indicate that this number is accurate and not an exaggeration, as the crowds marched for three hours without ceasing. Stormtroopers with motorcycles and sidecar motorcycles led the way, all covered with swastika flags. There were also people carrying effigies representing those who wanted to maintain the status quo, and the crowds clapped and cheered to mock them. Military bands played the Saar song, interspersed with the German national anthem and the National Socialist Party anthem. As dusk fell, the whole city was illuminated by electric lights, and almost every house had a huge image of Hitler, up to one meter high. However, the fervent emotions of the National Socialist Party quickly faded. By 10:00 PM, most of those who participated in the celebration, tired from a day of rushing around, had quietly returned home. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Celebrate Victory</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) German residents in this city hung flags on the 16th to celebrate the Saar vote victory. (16th special dispatch)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina: The government has recently allowed German residents here to fly the German flag to celebrate the return of the Saar region to Germany. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany held large-scale demonstrations across the country to celebrate the victory of the Saar vote. Propaganda Minister Goebbels spoke in Berlin, denouncing the Treaty of Versailles, saying that it was "meaningless and contrary to nature." He also criticized the Saar Administrative Commission, and finally suggested to the Saar socialist leader Planck that he might as well dig a grave and bury all the German exiles abroad in it. In conclusion, he said, "German territory is now complete and intact. Let us unite and move forward." (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Safety of the Opposition is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken: Amid this unforgettable joy, many people quietly packed their bags and paid attention to the train schedules. These are Saarlanders who oppose Hitlerism and fear that they will inevitably suffer under Hitler's rule, so they are planning to move to a better place. It is said that at least six or seven prominent figures from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party have already crossed the border. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: So far, there have only been some minor incidents in various places, all of which are insignificant. For example, the headquarters of the Socialist Party was surrounded by members of the German Front who wanted to break into the headquarters. The authorities closed the headquarters to avoid conflict. National Socialist Party members have repeatedly invaded private homes. In several places, the police have voluntarily abandoned their posts and been replaced by National Socialist Party members in uniform. (15th Lewas dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: After the results of the plebiscite were announced, the authorities took preventive measures, ordering all personnel in anti-National Socialist organizations to withdraw. As a result, the "People's Voice News" and the "Workers' Welfare Group" and other major strongholds of the anti-Hitler faction have been dismantled and seem to be on the verge of extinction. No overstepping actions occurred when the anti-National Socialist organizations were dismantled, perhaps due to fear of the international police. However, it can be said that it is a double misfortune that the outcome of the vote to maintain the status quo has failed, and personal safety is also a concern. Moreover, after the announcement of the plebiscite results, the international organizations seemed to think that their mission had been completed. For example, the leader of the Catholic anti-Hitler faction, Mr. Hoffmann, fearing for his life, requested protection from Captain Hannesse, an Englishman and police inspector of the Saar, but to no avail. He had no choice but to seek protection from others until he left the Saar region last night. In addition, fifteen French families were forced to leave their homes due to threats from the National Socialist Party and are temporarily sheltering around the mines managed by France. In view of these various incidents, people on the anti-National Socialist Party side expected the League of Nations to notify the international authorities that they are still responsible for maintaining order in the Saar region. However, some of the most prestigious leaders of the National Socialist Party announced to the representatives of Havas News Agency that the policy the party intends to continue to adopt in the Saar region now shows a tendency to ease. This policy can be divided into the following four points: (1) The National Socialist Party's victory on the Saar issue will not harm relations between France and Germany, because after the Saar issue is resolved, there will be no more territorial issues between France and Germany. (2) Regarding the leaders of the anti-National Socialist Party, the National Socialist Party believes that these people should be aware that their position is very difficult. (3) The National Socialist Party intends to use persuasion to convince opposition party members. (4) From a religious point of view, the result of this Saar vote can provide some relevant negotiating elements for the relationship between Germany and the Roman Curia, because German Catholics know that Germany and the Curia have the possibility of closer cooperation. Now that Saar Catholics have expressed their support for Hitler, it can further inspire German Catholics. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Streets Renamed to Commemorate</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The municipal authorities announced that Stresemann Street would be renamed "Saar Street" to commemorate January 13. This thoroughfare connects two stations, and trains can go directly from that station to the Saar, so this street was specially selected as Saar Street to show victory and to remember. The renaming ceremony was personally held by the Mayor of Berlin. (15th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reactions from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Italian Officials Satisfied</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian official circles unanimously expressed open satisfaction with the enthusiasm of the Saar people to return to their homeland. They also believe that since the number of votes for merging with Germany is so large, a completely clear situation has been created, and there is no objection. The League of Nations' handling of this issue must also follow a certain path, without much worry. (15th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Austrian People Rejoice</h3>
<p>(Vienna) When the people of Austria heard the results of the Saar vote, all those with nationalistic ideas were overjoyed. However, the government authorities are making every effort to prevent the expression of public sentiment, and have banned newspapers in Vienna from publishing extras or holding demonstrations. However, after receiving the news of the voting results in major cities in the provinces, the people spontaneously gathered in the streets, shouting slogans such as "Long live Germany" and "Long live the Saar" to celebrate. In the afternoon, the newspapers published detailed telegrams from the Saar, Berlin, and Geneva on a large scale. When they were sold on the streets, they were sold out in an instant. The Vienna Daily also raised in its editorial that former French Prime Minister Clemenceau claimed that there were 150,000 French people in the Saar region. Now the French people have been eliminated, and only 2,000 remain. Clemenceau advocated the annexation of the Saar by France during his lifetime. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Adam, the director of the Federal Propaganda Committee and the commander of the patriotic special forces, recently gave a radio broadcast speech, saying that in this Saar plebiscite, 90% supported returning to Germany. This is not only the wish of the National Socialist Party, but also the wish of other parties. However, what these people support is Germany, not the Germany led by the National Socialist Party. He also said, "Germany's victory in the Saar vote and the realization of the hopes of the German nation is something we should be happy about. Our Austrian concept of Germany is completely separate from our opinion of political parties and is not confused at all. Austria is a free German state. Austria has its own point of view and does not want to mix it up with Germany and those who are temporarily in power in Germany." (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Editorials of Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>French-German Cooperation Builds a Bridge</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's newspapers, after expressing their pleasure at the results of the Saar vote, all quoted Hitler's words, saying that "after the Saar returns to Germany, the territorial dispute between France and Germany will completely disappear." Propaganda Minister Goebbels also said in his speech that "cooperation between the two major neighboring nations has now built a bridge of transition. We may be in a historical period of transformation in European politics today, which should be attributed to Germany's decisive policy, and only Hitler can represent it." (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Russia Worries About Germany's Eastward Ambitions (Moscow) Soviet informed sources expressed surprise at the fact that the pro-German annexation faction won an overwhelming majority in the Saar plebiscite. However, it is said that the Saar vote achieved this result due to the National Socialist Party's vigorous propaganda and the Saar people's patriotic concepts. In addition, Soviet people also share the same views as people in other countries, believing that the clear voting results have clarified the situation in Western Europe, especially the relationship between France and Germany. It is generally believed that Hitler may soon make more concrete proposals to establish French-German understanding. However, it is particularly worrying that Germany's authority has increased after the Saar vote and that it may make risky and opportunistic moves in the weaker areas of the Central European political front. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Social Morality Should Be Respected: The Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" commented on the results of the Saar vote, hoping that a social and moral reaction would occur immediately to benefit the broad cause of peace. However, it is uncertain whether there will be brutal acts of revenge in the Saar region afterwards. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zinoviev Assassination Case: Zinoviev and Others Formally Tried</h3>
<p>Discovery of the So-Called [Moscow Center Group]</p>
<p>Engaged in Secret Anti-Soviet Activities</p>
<p>(Moscow) During the investigation of the Ningrad secret counter-revolutionary group related to the murder of Kirov, new information about the secret counter-revolutionary activities of Zinoviev, Gahev, and others has been discovered. At the same time, Bakayev and Shavrov confessed to various facts about the recent secret activities of the counter-revolutionary group [Moscow Center Group] during the investigation. Therefore, Zinoviev, Yevdokimov, Kamenev, Fedorov and fifteen others have been handed over to the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union for trial. The case began today in Leningrad. (TASS dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The indictment of the case against Zinoviev, Kamenev, and others has been released here as follows: During the investigation of the secret counter-revolutionary terrorist group that murdered Kirov, it was proven that the so-called [Moscow Center Group] was formed by former leaders of the Zinoviev anti-Soviet faction. Although the faction had surrendered, their secret work did not stop. Their purpose was to realize their counter-revolutionary attempts in accordance with the so-called Zinoviev-Trotsky program, and to carry out secret counter-revolutionary work in Moscow. It has now been proven that the members of the so-called [Moscow Center Group] are Zinoviev, Yevdokimov, Gherdik, Bakayev, Kuklin, Kamenev, Shavrov, Fedorov, and Gorshin. They also organized active members of the former Zinoviev anti-Soviet faction around them, while maintaining regular contact with members of the Leningrad group (i.e., those sentenced by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court on December 28 and 29, 1934). According to Fedorov's own confession, the "Moscow Center Group" was the political center that directed party members in Moscow and Leningrad for many years. One of the main purposes of this secret counter-revolutionary group led by the "Moscow Center Group" was to preserve its "cadres", accumulate its strength, and increase the hatred of its members for the leaders of the party and the Soviet government. They spread distorted reports of facts about domestic and foreign events among their members and made public counter-revolutionary explanations, etc. These counter-revolutionary "reports" were spread by those closest to Zinoviev and Yevdokimov, and Zinoviev and Yevdokimov used their political positions to carry out their criminal purposes. The trial proved that members of the "Moscow Center Group" such as Kuklin, Gherdik, Yevdokimov, and Sharov acted in this way. They frequently went to Leningrad and maintained counter-revolutionary contact with members of the "Leningrad Center Group." According to Fedorov's confession, this secret counter-revolutionary group never hesitated to use any means when it fought against the Soviet government. In this poisonous atmosphere of Zinoviev's secret group, the development and strengthening of fascist struggle methods and open terror psychology were not accidental, and as a result, the assassination of Kirov occurred. The defendants in this case and those in the case that needs to be further investigated all said that this tendency was the inevitable result of the entire nature and content of Zinoviev's secret work, and it was unavoidable. Defendant Zhelkov also said so, and said that Nikolaev's assassination methods were directly related to this "extreme tendency," and he said that the latter was based on Zinoviev's counter-revolutionary attempt. Defendant Bashkirov also said, "Nikolaev's assassination was precisely because he was a member of the Trotsky-Zinoviev counter-revolutionary organization and was educated by it, so the entire Trotsky-Zinoviev counter-revolutionary organization should be responsible for this." The trial did not prove that the "Moscow Center Group" had approved or instructed the assassination of Kirov, but in terms of the atmosphere and nature of the "Moscow Center Group," they must have known that the members of the group had a tendency toward terrorism, and even incited this tendency. The members of the "Moscow Center Group," especially Zinoviev, Yevdokimov, Gherdik, and Kamenev, must bear full moral and political responsibility. Not only that, according to Soviet law, they must also be responsible for the results of their own counter-revolutionary actions (that is, forcing their Leningrad group to take the path of terrorist actions). The defendants themselves cannot deny this responsibility, at least morally and politically.</p>
<p>When defendant Zinoviev spoke about his responsibility for the murder on December 1, he said, "The objective development of the situation is like this, and I can only plead guilty. If the anti-Party movement in Leningrad was so sharp in the past few years, it cannot but promote the degeneration of these revolutionaries. This assassination casts such an incomprehensible light on the entire anti-Party movement in the past. Therefore, I admit that it is correct to say that the former Zinoviev anti-Party organization should bear political responsibility for the assassination of Kirov."</p>
<p>Other defendants related to this case who have been tried, such as Bakayev, Gorshin, Fedorov, Yevdokimov, Sharov, Kuklin, and Gherdik, all admitted to being members of the "Moscow Center Group." Gerson, Panlemov, Brav, Herzberg, Vavilovitch, and Sakhov, etc., admitted to participating in the Zinoviev counter-revolutionary group. Zhelkov, Anishi, Bashkirov, and Terasov, etc., admitted that they participated in the Leningrad Zinoviev counter-revolutionary group.</p>
<p>Kamenev admitted his guilt and said that until 1932, he had participated in secret counter-revolutionary activities and had been a member of the "Moscow Center Group," but he had not completely severed relations with Zinoviev, only because of some daily life conditions. Kamenev also admitted that he "failed to actively and forcefully fight against the phenomenon of degeneration, which was the result of the anti-Party movement, and based on this, the dregs of the former anti-Party group were able to produce bandits, and at the same time, they were able to realize their criminal actions."</p>
<p>Zinoviev admitted his guilt and confirmed the existence of the Zinoviev faction center, and he did participate in it. Based on the above, the crimes committed by the nineteen defendants are as follows: Most of them participated in the secret counter-revolutionary group "Moscow Center Group," and the rest actively participated in the activities of secret counter-revolutionary groups in Moscow and Leningrad, resulting in the assassination of Kirov. In other words, they committed the crimes listed in Article 17 and Article 58, Sections 8 and 11 of the Criminal Law. (TASS dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, gave an opening speech at the 16th Soviet Congress of the Russian Soviet Republic, commemorating the murder of the great genius Kirov, who devoted his life to the people of the Soviet Union. The delegates to the Congress all stood up to mourn Kirov. Kalinin also said that since the last Congress, all the people of the Russian Republic have worked hard, and the results are very satisfactory. He listed the great buildings of various economic sectors, which have all started manufacturing in recent years. He also said that the collectivization of agriculture has almost been completed, and pointed out the great labor, which has now achieved the result of abolishing the bread ration system. "All the great work that has been completed, its promoter, inspirer, and organizer is Stalin." At this time, the Congress gave Stalin a long cheer, and all the delegates stood up and gave Stalin a long applause, with a sound like thunder. (TASS dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>French Authorities Delay Trip to London</h3>
<p>Disarmament Stance Awaiting Study</p>
<p>Anglo-French Talks to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval, who were originally scheduled to go to London around January 20, have now been delayed and are scheduled to depart for Britain on January 31. This date was decided this morning when Flandin met with British Ambassador to France Clerk. The Anglo-French talks will mainly focus on discussing the issue of disarmament. The British government hopes that Germany will rejoin the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, but so far, French Foreign Minister Laval has focused on studying various international issues, and has not yet determined France's position on disarmament. Moreover, it is impossible for Laval to do so before consulting with his cabinet members. Therefore, he had to postpone the date of his trip to Britain until the end of the month. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the situation in Europe has become slightly clearer due to the end of the Saar plebiscite, it has now suddenly become dim again, because the visit to London by French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval has been delayed. This news, which was transmitted to the diplomatic community after the cabinet meeting on Monday, seems to have confirmed the claim that obstacles have arisen in the Anglo-French talks. According to reliable sources, the two French politicians were originally scheduled to come here next week, but now they will be delayed until January 31. However, according to non-official sources, it may be postponed indefinitely. It is rumored here that Foreign Secretary Simon reported the situation of his talks with Laval in Geneva last Saturday at the cabinet meeting. As a result, the cabinet agreed that the meeting should be postponed. It is also widely rumored here that Laval means that France will not agree to cancel the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles without British security guarantees, but the British side is still unable to agree to this guarantee. (National dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources believe that Britain will propose to hold talks separately with representatives of European countries, and the first to be held will be the talks between Britain and France. Political figures attach great importance to the attitude of French public opinion towards the results of the Saar plebiscite, believing that it is evidence of France's desire for reconciliation, and this desire coincides with what Hitler expressed in his speech today. As for the speech delivered by French Prime Minister Flandin after the Saar plebiscite was announced, it was especially praised by those in charge here. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The British League of Nations Union shares the same attitude as the British authorities, firmly insisting on finding ways to allow Germany to return to Geneva, and the full results of the Rome Accords in terms of military arrangements are more well-founded. The Union issued a comment on the results of the Saar plebiscite, saying, "On the whole, it is quite interesting to observe the impact of the results of the Saar plebiscite on Hitler's foreign policy. Does Hitler feel that the time has come and should resolutely move towards the path of understanding with France? It is too early to predict this at present, but Germany can no longer use delaying tactics in the future to refuse to cooperate and engage in easing the European situation. In short, the Saar plebiscite has a very important result, that is, whether the peaceful aspirations touted by the Third Reich are sincere, and this will be proved by facts in the future."

<h3>France Responds to German Government on Eastern European Pact Issue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, the late French Foreign Minister Barthou went to London in early July last year to discuss it and obtained British approval. The British government notified the relevant countries to seek their consent. The German government issued a memorandum on September 10, raising reservations, saying that Germany would rather support bilateral treaties, but does not oppose multilateral treaties. However, when concluding multilateral treaties, the relevant countries should consult each other to seek a solution, and it should not be stipulated that military assistance must be provided to each other in the event of war. France has recently issued a response to this memorandum, which will be delivered to Foreign Secretary Bulow by Ambassador to Germany Ponsart. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>

Well-informed sources still say that Britain's attitude is the same as the attitude in the two declarations made by Britain, France, and Italy in February and September last year to maintain Austria's independence. Britain is prepared to participate in various measures to guarantee Austria's independence through consultation if necessary, but Britain is currently unable to participate in any new treaties in this regard.

<h3>Roosevelt Will Send Message to Senate</h3>
<p>Advocates Joining World Court and the Case is Expected to Pass</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources at the White House today, President Roosevelt will send a message to the Senate tomorrow, advocating that the United States join the World Court. The content of the message will be largely the same as Senator Robinson's speech when the Senate began debating the World Court case. According to Robinson's reason, the World Court handles international events with law instead of anarchy, and the United States' participation does not involve other disputes, nor does it need to abandon its traditional policies, but only expresses the sincerity of the American people's cooperation. As for the Senate's debate on this case, government leaders today advocated that it be extended indefinitely, but some senators predicted that they will express it at the end of this week. According to supporters' estimates, the case can get 69 votes, exceeding one-third. Opponents such as Borah and Norris also admit that it can be passed at this time, but they hope to win more opposition votes during the debate. (National</p>

<h3>Li Benwei Writes a Letter Stating the Distress of Remarrying</h3>

Li replied in a letter to Ping, the original text said that people's love is ordained by heaven, and its progress is endless. In this civilized world, when new morality is flourishing, widows are allowed to remarry. Remaining a widow and keeping chastity, spending years in hardship, is what foolish women do. You blame me for not remarrying, this is exactly what the wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence. I am also deeply grateful for your kindness. Although Duke Li treated me kindly, I have served him wholeheartedly for 20 years. Although I dare not say that I have repaid his kindness, I have not failed in the way of a woman. However, Duke Li's bones are not yet cold, and I cannot be tolerated by his descendants. If I do not seek to support myself, how can I survive? You are a discerning person and know the difficulty of my environment, and perhaps you will understand. Even if some people do not understand, I only seek the peace of my heart, what else should I care about? (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Northeast Remittance Issues</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Organization Announces Exchange Rules and Guidelines / Mail with the Words "Pseudo-State" is Found in the Ping City</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the resumption of postal remittances in the Northeast, there have been many mails sent from Beiping to the eastern provinces in recent days. However, some envelopes still have the words "Manchukuo" written on them. Because this writing contains the meaning of recognizing the pseudo-organization, the post office cannot collect and deliver them. If there are no such words and sufficient domestic stamps of 5 cents are affixed, they can be sent as usual. As for the mail entering the Guan from the eastern provinces, the envelopes actually have "Manchukuo" stamps of 4 cents affixed, and no special stamps are affixed. The post office has also not imposed fines for insufficient postage according to the insufficient postage method. After inspection of the envelope, there is a large rectangular stamp, which reads "The invalid stamps affixed to the letter have been compensated by this office," and the lower section states "Qinhuangdao Exchange and Transfer Bureau." This means that although no special stamps are affixed to the letter, it can still be received. As for the resumption of exchange inside and outside the Guan, it is decided to start on the first day of next month. Regarding the detailed rules of exchange, our side has not officially announced them. According to news from outside the Guan, the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the pseudo-Ministry of Transportation has now formulated the exchange rules, which were announced by the pseudo-Ministry on the 11th of this month, and stipulates that all recipients of remittances within the territory of Northeast China, if they move to Japan, or recipients of remittances in Guan Nei, when they move to Japan, may receive their remittances at the Japanese post office. The exchange rules are recorded below:</p>
<p>Exchange Rules: Chapter 1, General Rules: Article 1: The usual exchange between "Man" and China is the "Man" China exchange. Article 2: The post offices handling the "Man" China exchange have separate announcements. Article 3: The exchange amount remitted or transferred to the same person on the same day, mainly based on postal services, is divided into three types: 100 yuan limit, 400 yuan limit, and 800 yuan limit. Article 5: The exchange fee for each copy is as follows: up to 10 yuan, 15 cents; up to 20 yuan, 25 cents; up to 30 yuan, 35 cents; up to 50 yuan, 55 cents; up to 100 yuan, 1 yuan; up to 150 yuan, 1 yuan and 50 cents; above, every 50 yuan or odd number, an additional 50 cents will be added. (The next five chapters are omitted because they are the same as the main points of handling)</p>
<p>Main Points of Handling: The main points of handling exchange inside and outside the Guan have also been announced by the pseudo-Ministry of Transportation as follows: (1) Exchange Currency: The remittance from "Manchukuo" is based on the national currency, and the payment is made by the post office of the Republic of China in accordance with the conversion of its own currency. The remittances from the Republic of China are based on the national currency of the Republic of China, and the payment is made by the post office of "Manchukuo" after converting the national currency according to the market price at the time. (2) Maximum Exchange Limit: The exchange quota per person per day for remitting and returning to the post office is divided into three types. The exchange amount limits are as follows: Type A is up to 100 yuan, Type B is up to 400 yuan, and Type C is up to 800 yuan. (3) Exchange Rate: The exchange rate is exchanged in the local currency circulating in the remittance area in the Republic of China. When exchanging, a small amount of water money is charged. (4) Exchange Date: The exchange is made within six months from the date of issue of the bill of exchange. If there is no request, the remittance will still be returned to the remitting country. (5) Return Period: The remitting bureau notifies the remitter of the bill of exchange returned to the remitting country. The remitter, within one year from the date of issue of the bill of exchange, if he does not request the return of the remittance, the remittance will not be paid after the approval of the Minister of Transportation. (6) Exchange Statute of Limitations: The exchange is exchanged within three years from the date of issue of the bill of exchange. If the payment is not requested, it will be confiscated into the ""National Treasury." (7) Re-issuance: If the bill of exchange is lost, damaged, or contaminated, the remitter or recipient must request a certificate of re-payment from the remitting post office or the paying post office. At this time, if one jiao (stamp) is attached to the request, the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the original remitting country will re-issue a certificate and send it to the applicant. (8) Transfer When remitting from Japan, if the recipient of the Man-Japan exchange moves to the Republic of China, or if the recipient of the exchange remitted from Manchuria moves from the Republic of China to Japan, the remittance may be requested to be transferred. The water fee at this time will be deducted from the remittance and transferred by a new exchange. (15th)</p>

<h3>Yu Bei Huojia County</h3>
<p>Bumper Harvest of American Cotton</p>
<p>Yields Seven to Eight Times Greater Than Other Grains</p>
<p>Xinxiang Telegraph. In the past, rural Huojia County in Yu Bei relied heavily on the cultivation of indigo (a blue dye) as its main source of income. However, in recent years, the market has been flooded with foreign dyes, leading to the disappearance of local indigo altogether. Farmers were forced to switch to growing cotton. The cotton-producing areas include more than 160 villages such as Kangyi in the south, Zhonghe Town, Xiao Cheng, Da Guan, Xiaoguanzhuang, Wufu Village, Wanggaolou, and Luoqiying. When cotton cultivation first began, only 70 to 80 mu of cotton were planted per 100 mu of land. Moreover, due to the poor quality of the seeds, the plants were weak. Each cotton plant grew to a maximum height of only three feet, and the thickest branches were no thicker than a finger. As a result, each plant bore only 30 to 60 cotton bolls. This year, the villages switched to growing American cotton. The seeds were excellent, and the rainfall was favorable, resulting in vigorous growth. Each plant reached a height of six to seven feet, and the branches were mostly as thick as chicken eggs. Consequently, each plant produced as many as 200 to 300 cotton bolls. In the past, each mu yielded approximately 30 to 40 jin of cotton. This year, the average yield is expected to be 120 to 130 jin per mu. The current price of cotton is about 22 yuan per 100 jin (for seed cotton). This means a profit of 30 yuan per mu, which is seven to eight times more than growing autumn grains. The farmers are overjoyed with this unexpected harvest, which is truly a positive development in the effort to revitalize rural areas.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Relief Grain Levy Continues</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Voluntarily Stop Paying Relief Grain Tax on Exported Rice</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence. The Anhui Provincial Government, in order to provide relief for the drought in the province, established civil food regulation branches in Wuhu, Bengbu, and other places, and implemented a levy on exported rice at a rate of five sheng per shi. Merchants jointly opposed this measure. As a result, the relief grain collection point set up at Dashengguan on the Jiangsu border was abolished and moved to Xiliangshan in Anhui. Meanwhile, Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that it consider the special circumstances of southern Anhui and approve the continued collection for three months, ending at the end of March. The Executive Yuan decided to limit the collection to the end of December of last year and telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to comply. However, the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce noted that the relief grain collection point in that area had not yet complied with the order to cease collection and was still collecting as usual. They telegraphed the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce to inquire whether Wuhu was also continuing to collect. The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce replied that the collection point had not been abolished either. In addition to sending a telegram to the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce, they also planned to telegraph the central government and the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting that they issue a prompt order to abolish all relief grain collection points in various locations in order to reduce the burden and maintain commerce. The Wuhu Rice and Grain Transportation Guild, considering the matter to be closely related to their own interests, sent a letter to the Yanguan Customs Office on the 11th, stating that since the Executive Yuan had decided to abolish the relief grain tax, they would no longer pay it on exported rice and that there should be no such item as a relief grain tax in the future. They requested that the Customs Office inspect and release any rice merchants reporting rice for export. They also telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government, explaining the reasons for not paying the relief grain tax and requesting a reply (11th).</p>
<h3>Foreigner on British Ship Longhe</h3>
<p>Beats Chinese Laborer, Leading to Suicide</p>
<p>Body Transported to Wuhu, Examination Reveals Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Shanghai and Wuhu Seamen Express Outrage and Offer Support</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence. The Longhe, a ship operated by the British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. on the Yangtze River, arrived in Wuhu on the 23rd of last month and unloaded the body of a Chinese laborer, Tong Tianhou, onto Jardine Matheson's pontoon. Upon learning that Tong had been brutally beaten by a ticket seller named Newman and forced to jump into the river, resulting in his death, the workers in the midships of all the Shanghai riverboat companies and the Wuhu Seamen's Union were filled with indignation. They formed a support association to investigate and engage in serious negotiations. The Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Union believed that the matter not only involved the mistreatment of Chinese laborers but also the disregard for the lives of Chinese people. It instructed the Wuhu Seamen's Union to investigate the details. The Wuhu Union sent representatives to the Public Security Bureau's water patrol and the local court to investigate the matter in detail. The truth of the matter is as follows:</p>
<p>Tong Tianhou, a worker in the midships of the Xianghe, also owned by Jardine Matheson, had missed the Xianghe's earlier departure from Shanghai to Hankou. Fearing that this would affect his job, he hastily took a Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing. However, by the time he arrived at Xiaguan, the Xianghe had already passed Nanjing and sailed upstream. He then boarded the Longhe, intending to catch up with the Xianghe at the upstream docks. When the Longhe reached the Jiangning County section of the river, the foreign ticket seller, Newman, discovered that Tong had not purchased a ticket and was not wearing his certificate badge. He demanded that Tong buy a ticket. Tong explained that he was a worker on a sister ship and that he had left his badge on the Xianghe because he was not on duty. He also explained that he did not have much money and repeatedly requested to buy a half-price ticket. However, the foreigner not only refused but also punched and kicked him repeatedly. He insisted that Tong buy a full-price ticket. Tong was powerless against the abuse and did not have enough money to buy a full-price ticket. Although the ship was large, he had nowhere to stand. In desperation, he saw no other option than to leave the ship. He jumped into the river immediately. Passengers on the ship, unable to bear the sight, protested to the captain. The captain stopped the ship and had Tong pulled out of the water. However, he was barely breathing and on the verge of death. When the Longhe arrived at Yanhu and docked at the pontoon, Tong had already died. The captain ordered the workers to carry Tong's body ashore, and the person in charge of the pontoon reported the matter to the local court. After examination by Prosecutor Wang Gai, accompanied by clerks and police officers, it was determined that Tong Tianhou had three serious injuries to the back of his head and arms, which were the fatal wounds. The deceased was from Hubei and was about 30 years old. He had worked on the Xianghe for many years. The Wuhu Seamen's Union has reported the above facts to the Shanghai General Union and has planned steps to engage in serious negotiations with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to seek justice for the deceased and protect human rights (13th).</p>
<h3>Lu Xi Refugees Flock to Jinan</h3>
<p>Numbering About Four to Five Thousand People</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is Planning Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Last year, counties such as Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu in western Shandong suffered from floods again. During this harsh winter, refugees have been flocking to Jinan in search of food. Several thousand refugees have built shacks and settled in the flooded areas west of Guanzhaying and south of the Jinpu Railway's Xiawa. During the day, men try to find manual labor but are unsuccessful. Elderly, weak women beg in the mud, unable to get enough to eat. At night, they return to their shacks and sleep on wet mats. When these impoverished refugees first arrived in Jinan, the municipal government built earthen houses east of Gangzi and south of the Jiaoji Railway to house them, creating a village-like community with police guarding it, which was quite orderly. Now, a special request has been submitted to the municipal government to handle this situation in the same way as before. According to this request, the municipal government dispatched personnel to investigate and found that there were approximately 1,500 shacks built by refugees west of Guanzhaying, with each shack housing between three and five refugees, totaling approximately four to five thousand people. Adult men drag small carts in the Tianqiao area, but their daily wages are barely enough to afford one full meal. The elderly, weak, and women have no other way to make a living except by begging. Beggars are appearing in the streets in large numbers. Although the police have tried to stop them, they cannot be completely prevented from begging in small alleys due to their desperate need for food. These refugees are suffering from hunger and cold, and their situation is already pitiful. Moreover, their shacks are located in low-lying areas, and if it rains or snows, they will be trapped in water and snow, making it even more difficult to survive. Mayor Wen Chenglie previously requested the establishment of winter shelters and was authorized to establish three, each limited to 500 people. However, recent investigations have revealed that each shelter is housing more than 600 or 700 people. The number of indigent people in the city's poorhouse has also increased sharply to more than 900. There is no way to free up funds, and the housing is insufficient. According to the proposal submitted by Zhou, erecting temporary shelters to provide shelter would cost approximately 2,000 yuan, which is also a significant amount. The city is finding it difficult to raise these funds. A request has been submitted to the provincial relief committee for relief grain or to find housing, and the Red Swastika Society has sent people to investigate and distribute flour to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report from the Magistrate of Caoxian County</h3>
<p>The Beginning and End of the Sun Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Sun Family Has a Wife and Children</p>
<p>So-called Hardship Love Like This</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. The case of Sun Defu and Han Guiqing, known as "Seeking a Husband Thousands of Miles Away" and "Hardship Love," was widely circulated for a time. Yesterday, according to a report from Wei Hanzhang, the magistrate of Caoxian County, to the Department of Civil Affairs, the lawsuit of Sun was described in detail, stating that Sun had other intentions and that Sun had a wife and children at home. The people who praised Sun and Han also feel disappointed. The original report is disclosed below: "On January 4, 1935, the Jinan Evening News published a detailed report on the interview with Han Guiqing, a lady who sought her husband Sun Defu thousands of miles away. And on December 29, 1934, the Dagong Bao published a report on Sun Defu and his wife, who fought against difficulties and took revenge for their father. The reports that Sun Defu's father was murdered by Li Baoqing and seized his property do not conform to the facts. Sun Defu was originally from Kaocheng County, Henan Province. He had a wife, Sun Qu, who was 33 years old, and a 7-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter. There is a written report from Sun Defu himself to prove it. The Dagong Bao reported that Chairman Han personally reviewed and ordered Li Baoqing and others to repay Sun Defu 60,000 yuan and 5 qing of land, which is not true. Based on the above, it is enough to prove that the reports are all false and fabricated facts with other intentions. I will carefully describe the detailed facts of this case to your seat. On May 6, 1933, I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Han Yu, stating that Sun Defu accused Li Baoqing of seizing property. I was ordered to send Li Baoqing to the province for trial within half a month. The county magistrate personally led officers and soldiers to arrest Li Baoqing and sent him to the province for trial. Later, I received a letter from the Military Law Office of the Third Route Command of the Expeditionary Army, stating that the case of Sun Defu accusing Li Baoqing was inconsistent with the facts and could not be judged. Now, I received an order from the commander to send the plaintiff and defendant back to the original county for detailed investigation. I was ordered to handle the case accordingly and report the handling situation. I was also asked to send 15 contracts, 2 receipts, and 1 volume. I repeatedly investigated the case. Sun Defu confessed that he was from Sunjia Village, Chumaodian, Kaocheng County, Henan Province. Because of his old grudges with Li Baoqing's family, his father was murdered by Li Gaojian and others instigated by Li Baoqing in the 34th year of Guangxu. Li Gaojian also led people to rob his wife and children for ransom. Li Gaojian also led dozens of people to find him and try to murder him several times without success. In 1929, he filed a lawsuit in the Henan Provincial Government. Chairman Han ruled that he was given 2 qing of land and a house. Because he did not pay the grain tax, he could not manage the property. Later, he filed two lawsuits. After mediation, Li Baoqing gave him 3 items and 48 mu of land, and 46 tile houses. He had a written contract, but he refused to comply. Li Baoqing confessed that he was 36 years old. Sun Defu's father died during the Guangxu period. At that time, he was only 10 years old. He did not have the ability to instigate murder. Li Gaojian was three or four years older than him and was also the head of the family. Not only could he not be used by him, but a person of a few years old had no courage to kill. His complaint was false. The people can testify</p>
<p>Transactions, almost stopped. As a result, the bank was greatly affected. Few people asked about the sale of real estate. Moreover, because the end of the year was approaching, the city's financial resources were tight, and depositors withdrew their money one after another. The bank's current money had already been used for real estate investment and could not be paid in time, which led to a bank run. At first, the bank planned to borrow 500,000 yuan from a bank in Hong Kong to meet the urgent needs, using the bank's assets as collateral. However, the mortgage of the assets required legal procedures such as newspaper registration, which delayed the time. Also, because one or two of the bank's directors were irresponsible, the loan failed to materialize. The depositors' withdrawals increased day by day, and the bank was helpless. On the 4th of this month, it announced its closure. At the same time, the head office on Des Voeux Road, Hong Kong, also went bankrupt. The Shanghai branch followed suit. On the evening of the 5th, the Hong Kong head office convened a board meeting to discuss the aftermath. It was decided to issue a formal notice to convene a meeting of shareholders and creditors on the 16th of this month to discuss the investment of assets and the maintenance of the interests of depositors. In Guangzhou, the bank's creditors, who had been greatly in debt, immediately established a creditors' association registration office and hired lawyers to handle everything (9th).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Reorganizes Fishermen's Associations</h3>
<p>Consulting Various Provincial and Municipal Governments for Implementation</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the purpose of establishing fishermen's associations is to increase the knowledge and skills of fishermen, improve their lives, and develop production. In areas with thriving fisheries that have not yet established fishermen's associations, they should be urged to organize them as soon as possible. In areas that already have fishermen's associations but whose organizations are unsound, or where disputes arise frequently and no achievements can be made, they should be guided and reorganized in accordance with the law to fulfill the central government's earnest intention to improve fisheries. Therefore, eight items for attention by the competent supervisory authorities of fishermen's associations have been formulated and sent to the provincial and municipal governments along the Yangtze River and the coast, and the Weihaiwei Management Office has been ordered to transmit them to its subordinates for compliance. The items for attention by the competent supervisory authorities of fishermen's associations are as follows: "(1) In counties, cities, or important ports that meet the requirements of Articles 4, 1, and 2 of the Fishermen's Association Law but have not established fishermen's associations, they should be urged to organize them in accordance with the law. (2) Fishermen or those engaged in the production, transportation, storage, and management of aquatic products who initiate the organization of fishermen's associations in accordance with the law and have been approved for registration by the competent supervisory authorities should be ordered to submit the date of establishment, the resumes of elected officers, and the membership list to the department for record. (3) When the terms of directors and supervisors of fishermen's associations reach the prescribed limit, they should be urged to hold elections in accordance with the law and report them to the department for record. (4) Fishermen's associations that have been approved for record should be urged to actively carry out their prescribed tasks and local fishery conditions. (5) When fishermen's associations decide to raise business funds and carry out joint ventures, they should submit a business plan and a budget to the competent supervisory authorities for approval before collecting funds. (6) Fishermen's associations that have been established for more than one year should be urged to report to the department for record each year in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Fishermen's Association Law. (7) Fishermen's associations that do not work hard in accordance with the tasks prescribed by their respective associations should report the facts to the higher authorities for handling at any time. (8) In areas with thriving fisheries that have not established fishermen's associations, existing fishery organizations established by fishermen should be urged to reorganize in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Fishermen's Association Law within a time limit. If fishermen's associations have been established, these organizations should be ordered to merge into the fishermen's associations. If they do not merge, the organizations outside the fishermen's associations should be ordered to cease activities."</p>

<p>In Zhengzhi Township, Qidong Second District, the large household Wu Qingyu Village was suddenly raided by more than a dozen bandits with flashlights and guns late the other night.

When he refused, they beat him with wooden sticks, causing him to be covered in injuries. They then went to the room, turned over boxes and cabinets, searched arbitrarily, and left after about an hour.

<h3>Total Agency for Trafficking in Southeastern China Smashed</h3>
<p>Recently, young women have been disappearing from this county and neighboring counties from time to time. The local public security authorities have ordered a serious investigation. Recently, it was found that there is a total agency for trafficking in southeastern China in Xiang'an Lane on Malu Road, hosted by the vagrant Ma Zishan. The content organization is quite systematic, and accomplices such as Xu Kunlin and Li Peitang have been assigned to set up branch agencies in Shanghai, Suzhou, Zhenjiang! Nanjing, Bengbu, etc. The Wuxi general agency entices and buys young women and transports them to Zhenjiang, Bengbu and other places for sale. Recently, there was news of opening a brothel in Zhenjiang. The Bengbu and Zhenjiang branch agencies sent letters to Wuxi to contact and buy women. Ma Zishan then dispatched his feathers and outcasts to lure and deceive them. Wang, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, learned of the above situation, and immediately sent two male and female scouts, posing as brothers and sisters, to sell themselves. Ma Zishan negotiated and informed the Zhenjiang branch agency to send Xu Kunlin, Li Peiyu and others to Wuxi to purchase them. They opened room No. 2 of Wuxi Hotel and agreed on a price of 240 yuan, to be delivered the next day. Yesterday, Ge, the inspector, disguised himself and led a scout to join the Tuzheng and waited in ambush in room 19. When Ma Zishan and others negotiated the delivery with the male and female scouts, they rushed in to make the arrest and arrested Ma Zishan, Xu Kunlin, Li Peitang, Zhang Zhongkun, and Pan Fengting on the spot. Several letters of trafficking were also found on each person. Later, at the General Agency in Xiang'an Lane and No. 4 Dongxin Road, Ma Cai, Li Qin, Wu Maogen, Wang Xuemei, Xu Feng and other five men and women were successively arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Director Chen assigned several inspectors to take documents to the cities of Jing, Zhen, Hu and Beng and other places to arrest accomplices and abduction criminals.</p>

<p>Five Exchanges in the City Vigorously Advocate for Exchange Tax and Jointly Appeal to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Assistance; Mu Ouchu Reported on Tax Collection by the Ministry of Finance; Brokers' Associations Held General Meetings Separately Yesterday</p>
<p>The Council of the five exchanges of the city--gold, securities, flour and miscellaneous grains--and the five brokers' associations, specially hosted a banquet for the members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday at 7 p.m. regarding the central government's imposition of exchange tax. They appealed for assistance. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives:</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jin Runxiang, Standing Committee Member, Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Gauze Association, Zhang Weiru from the Securities Association, Xu Busun from the Gold Association, Wang Yiting from the Flour Association, Gu Xinyi from the Miscellaneous Grains Association, and representatives from the brokers' associations: Wang Zhengru, Wu Limen, Zhu Anfu, Qiu Liangui, He Peiyuan from Securities; Zhan Liansheng, Wang Yingchang, Wang Jiafu, Gao Qiumei, Zhang Zhusun from Gold; Zhang Weiyun, Zhu Jiansheng, Xia Rongchang, Wang Zhongliang, Yang Jingcheng from Flour; Chuan Changyu, Xue Chengzhang, Xu Jianqi, Qu Guanfu, Ding Futing from Miscellaneous Grains; and Bian Futang, Wu Xunqing, Shao Wenmei, Zhang Bojin, Kuang Jian from Gauze, etc., more than 40 people attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Mu Ouchu was elected chairman. He stood up and reported, saying: "In recent years, the world has been affected by the economic depression, and domestically, we have been plagued by floods, droughts, bandits, and disasters, resulting in rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial decline, and stagnation of the circulation of goods and wealth. The national economy is deteriorating, and the future crisis is terrifying. The exchange is the balancing mechanism of the modern economic organization. The sale and purchase of goods are based on fairness. Although there are commission earnings, the responsibilities are also very important. Now the Ministry of Finance is imposing exchange tax to increase the national treasury income. When the news came, the business of each exchange greatly reduced. In the future, after the review and approval of the Legislative Yuan and the implementation of the tax, it will not only increase the burden of the buyers and sellers of the exchanges, but also fundamentally affect the position of the exchanges. Each exchange has sent representatives to the central government to petition, and the result is that they will be allowed to attend the review meetings of the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan to make statements. It is now heard that the tax rate will soon be submitted for review. Therefore, it is decided to appeal to the central government to temporarily postpone the matter. This is not only for the benefit of the exchanges themselves, but also to reduce the burden on industry and commerce. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the leading organization of all industries, and the hardships of merchants can be seen without any reservations. We hope that Chairman Yu will make a fair proposition and do his best to assist." Then Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wen Lanting, Wu Limen and others expressed their opinions. The banquet ended at 8:30.</p>
<p>Representatives to Nanjing:</p>
<p>The exchange authorities have decided to appoint Xu Busun, Mu Ouchu, Gu Xinyi, Zhang Weiru, and Wang Yiting as the five directors to be representatives to Nanjing. The brokers' associations have already appointed Wang Zhengru, Zhan Liansheng, Zhang Weiyun, Chuan Changyu, and Bian Futang as the five representatives to request to attend the meeting.

The National News Agency reporter interviewed Dr. Qian Chengxu, the former secretary of the Shandong Industrial Inspection Team. According to Qian, he received a telegram from Shandong that Zhang will transfer to Shanghai from the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway within days, and will arrive on Sunday. As for Zhang's mission here, according to personal speculation, he may need to negotiate with the government and the financial industry on the Xiaocheng River project and the siphon irrigation project. He said that the Xiaocheng River is an important river in Shandong. The Industrial Inspection Team visited Shandong and inspected it. The river is 403 miles long and has been silted up for a long time. If it is dredged, 3,000-ton seagoing vessels can sail to Yangjiaogou, and 200-ton vessels can go directly to Jinan. As for the word "siphon", it means using the water of the Yellow River on the silted river beach of the Yellow River, connecting the water pipes, and irrigating the farmland on both sides. It was originally planned to be carried out in 14 counties including Juancheng, Fanxian, Dong'a, Pingyin, Feicheng, Changqing, and Jiyang, and could irrigate an area of ​​1,745,000 acres, requiring a construction cost of 4,430,000 yuan.

<p>Money Supply Has Eased: The foreign exchange used in the Shanghai money market has fallen to 18 cents yesterday, which shows that the money supply in Shanghai has eased. According to the New Voice News reporter's investigation, although member banks and money houses of the silver and money industries can safely pass the account closing period, due to the impact of the rural recession and the reduction of people's purchasing power, many businesses in various industries have suffered losses last year. In particular, general commercial firms have been most affected, so it is inevitable that there will be owners going bankrupt at the time of closing accounts.</p>
<p>American Commercial Commissioner Arnold Returns to Shanghai After Leave;</p>
<p>The American Commercial Commissioner to China, Arnold, returned to Shanghai on the President Hoover ship recently after taking six months leave last year. He resumed work this morning. When in Washington, Arnold paid a visit to President Roosevelt, who was very concerned about Chinese affairs and stated that one of the reasons was that his ancestors were related to the American company, The Oldest in China, which was the first to do business in China in the previous century. While in the United States, Arnold felt that the majority of people had deep trust in the current government and wanted its policies to be thoroughly tested. There were signs of a change for the better throughout the country. Arnold spent much of his vacation time in business gatherings and talks between China and the United States, and in giving speeches on trade between the two countries. When the National Foreign Trade Council held its twenty-third annual meeting in New York, Arnold participated in drafting procedures for trade development. Seattle, Baudron, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have recently organized Asian societies to serve as clearing houses for commercial contracts with the Far East, which Arnold is very concerned about. This move has been enthusiastically supported by Commerce Minister Roper and Mao Qisheng, director of the Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade.</p>

<p>Reactions to Merchants' Request to Stop Cotton Futures Trading; The China Cotton Industry Federation Submits a Document to the Government</p>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Federation submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and the Municipal Government regarding the fact that a few manufacturers have requested the cessation of cotton futures trading on the China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn. The document states that cotton futures trading has nothing to do with the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn, and requests that the original business be maintained. It is learned that recently a few manufacturers have requested the cessation of cotton futures trading on the China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn in an attempt to remedy the situation. Merchants and others in the cotton industry dare not agree. All countries in the world have measures to equalize the prices of agricultural products and help rural villages and farmers, but there are no measures to suppress the prices of agricultural products and help factories. In 1934, comparing cotton prices around the world, our country was the lowest, and Shanghai was the lowest in our country. The reason why we achieved this result is that we rely on the agencies to set standard prices every day and equalize market prices according to law, so yarn factories are not easy to oppress cotton merchants and farmers. However, the various yarn factories of the China Merchants side take the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn as the only reason for the loss. They do not ask themselves how their technology is, how their management is. If they are not improved, even if the raw materials are extremely low, the yarn factories will still have no way. The evidence is that some Chinese and foreign yarn factories also have surpluses last year. Therefore, the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn cannot be used as an excuse. Moreover, between the summer and autumn of last year, some Chinese yarn factories expected a bumper harvest and the price of cotton would fall, so they sold a large amount of cotton yarn without buying cotton. When the new cotton was on the market, foreign yarn factories rushed to buy it, while the Chinese yarn factories still waited for the price to fall. By now, they have purchased domestic cotton at high prices, and because of the silver problem, the price difference between foreign cotton and domestic cotton is even greater. Therefore, it is secretly said that the high price of cotton is caused by the manufacturers themselves. What is there to complain about? In the past, the price of cotton was only determined by the manufacturers. It is not the case now. The height of the cotton price is fundamentally driven by the farmers. In recent years, our government has spared no effort to revive the countryside. The financial sector's rural lending has directly benefited the countryside. As farmers, they will definitely wait for the price to sell. The high price of cotton is a major reason. Manufacturers are also part of the people, so why must they suppress it to make it low? Or, the price of buying and selling still listens to the manufacturers. It is self-sufficient. Merchants and others have been in the cotton industry for a long time. They usually purchase cotton from all over the country and concentrate it in Shanghai. Because of inconvenient transportation, goods cannot arrive in Shanghai on time, and prices fluctuate again. The purchase and sale of sets have been no different. If cotton is stopped from being auctioned, cotton merchants and farmers will both be harmed. This kind of proposition cannot be adopted. It is reasonable to list the facts and request verification. The cotton futures trading rate should be maintained according to the old regulations to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants.</p>

<p>Summary of Donations to Drought Disaster Relief Associations in Various Provinces:</p>
<p>The Drought Disaster Relief Associations in various provinces have been mobilizing donations or donating relief funds themselves, and have been published in newspapers.

All the donations that have been mobilized will be distributed to households by the association and receipts will be sent back after the previously sent donation books are sent. Gao Jun Henian is an advanced Buddhist scholar who has put down everything and traveled around the world. Economically speaking, it can be said that he has no means of support. Now, based on my Buddha's compassionate and generous wishes, he has raised a large amount of money to save the people from suffering. He is truly a model for Buddhists. The philanthropists who donate money are concerned about the victims, enthusiastic about relief, and feel the same pain. They are deeply moved. It is hoped that the elders and Buddhist laymen in the mountains and throughout the country will respond enthusiastically, spread the spirit of Mahayana, and save the wailing people, so that Mr. Gao will not be the only one in the lead. This newspaper will pray for him.</p>

<p>Copper Coins Distributed: Large Nine, Small Six</p>
<p>Since the Zhabei soup kitchen continued to open, ordinary poor people, supporting the old and leading the young, went to wait for distribution, with the number reaching 15,000 to 16,000 daily. Yesterday morning, it suddenly increased to over 20,000, requiring 34 shi and 4 dou of rice per day, which was still insufficient for distribution. As a result, those who came later had to be given nine large and six small copper coins, totaling forty to fifty yuan. According to Wang Binyan, director of the Charity Group, since the heavy rain and cold weather of the previous day, many who were unable to make a living had come here. In addition, a large number of disaster victims had arrived from Anhui, looking disheveled and miserable. The number of poor people is increasing daily, making it difficult to sustain. He hopes that charitable people will generously donate to allow the operation to continue uninterrupted.

The Northern and Southern Seas routes have the Huashan, Songshan, Lushan, and Tangshan, totaling four ships. There is one ship each on the Hankou-Yichang and Yichang-Chongqing lines. The total number of ships is ten. Each voyage, apart from transshipment of goods from Japan, has very few Chinese merchants. Passenger fare income is only enough to cover the ship's expenses. Therefore, it is currently only maintaining existing routes, waiting for an opportunity.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Writes to Customs Regarding</h3>
<p>Anchorage for Pig Boats on the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent yesterday, stating, "We are writing regarding a letter received from the Fresh Pig Industry Association this month, which states that the Jiangbei Six Port Pig Boat Workers United Office has written that our pig boats have been transporting fresh pigs from various ports in Jiangbei to Shanghai for decades, unloading them in front of the Xuejiabang Oil Mill Wharf in Nanshi. Unexpectedly, recently, when ships anchored at Xuejiabang, they were unjustifiably fined by the water patrol team, occurring several times a day. After investigation, most pig boats anchor at Xuejiabang within the Jianghai Customs buoys, without obstructing the waterway, while other types of ships, such as timber and miscellaneous grain, have fixed anchorages. Only our pig boats anchor in open spaces, leading to arrests and fines. Our boatmen's families depend on transporting goods for a small fee to make a living. If we do not request assistance to negotiate for a proper anchorage, what will become of our industry? Therefore, we urgently request a joint effort, otherwise our boatmen will have to unload at Wusong and no longer sail to Shanghai. It is also claimed that there are three sand boat buoys in the Huangpu River in front of Xuejiabang, with large sand boats and fishing boats anchored in the middle. Pig boats must detour to unload, which is dangerous in high tide and with favorable winds. We urge your association to find a way to resolve the difficulty to facilitate navigation. According to this, our industry has leased a shoreline from the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau in Nanshi at Xuejiabang, paying an annual shoreline usage fee, and has built a wharf to unload pigs for many years. Having been approved to build a wharf, there must be a corresponding anchorage; otherwise, the wharf would be useless. However, various types of ships on the Huangpu River often take precedence over the owner, arbitrarily anchoring in front of our wharf, causing pig boats arriving in Shanghai to have no place to dock. If they accidentally anchor in an open space, they are accused of obstructing traffic and fined. It is not our pig boats that are to blame for this obstruction of traffic. Regarding the request to resolve the danger of navigation, we sent personnel to investigate and found that pig boats sailing to Xuejiabang in Nanshi to unload must detour to avoid sand boat buoys, which is indeed prone to danger. If a method could be devised to request that the two middle buoys be moved to the open space on the south side and connected to buoy number six, pig boats coming south from the north could sail directly to the front of the wharf, lower their anchors, and moor. It would be both convenient for navigation and beneficial for berthing, a win-win situation. A sketch map is attached. It is feared that pig boats have nowhere to anchor, and detours can easily create dangerous voyages. If pig boats hesitate, it will be a great concern for the future of our business. Therefore, we have no choice but to request your association's assistance in forwarding a letter to the Jianghai Customs to request (1) to designate an anchorage for pig boats at Xuejiabang in Nanshi as soon as possible, (2) to move the two middle sand boat buoys south and connect them to buoy number six to facilitate pig boat navigation and berthing. Your kindness will be greatly appreciated. Two attached maps are sent to the association. We find that the two points requested by the association are not only related to the safety of pig boat workers and the avoidance of unjust punishment but also greatly beneficial to water traffic administration, reducing the danger of navigation. The matter is urgent, and the request is very proper. Accordingly, we enclose the original attached map and send a letter to forward it. We ask your superintendent to forward it to the Customs for approval and implementation, so as to benefit industry and commerce. This is our public obligation."</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhongyu's Family</h3>
<p>Kidnapped Child Escapes Danger</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Arrested</p>
<p>Sent to Court This Morning</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyu, a wealthy silk merchant, has been operating the Pinghe and Siyi silk factories in Huaxing Lane on Baoding Road and Qingfuli on Zhoujiazui Road. His business has prospered, and he has accumulated some savings, attracting the attention of bandits. On December 12 of last year, at around 10:00 a.m., several kidnappers, using the pretext of distributing red eggs, entered Zhang's residence at No. 10 Senchangli, Kunming Road, by tricking them into opening the door. They rushed in, threatening with guns, and kidnapped Zhang's four-year-old son, Yangge, and fled. Zhang reported the incident to the police, who issued an arrest warrant. However, Zhang suddenly received a letter from the bandits some days ago, demanding a huge ransom, and scheduled a meeting at Room 321 of the Far East Hotel on Tibet Road at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The case was discovered by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Department, who directed detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and Song Bingzheng to secretly go to Room 321 of the Far East Hotel at around 10:00 a.m. and arrest three kidnappers, including Zhu Huawen. They learned the location of the kidnapped child and rushed to the kitchen of No. 9 Guangxingli, Wuchang Road, and rescued the child, Zhang Yangge, from danger. A woman surnamed Wei Wang, who was watching the child, was also arrested and taken to the police station. After escorting Zhang Yangge home and handing him over to his father, the police are now strictly interrogating the suspects to apprehend their accomplices. The arrested suspects will be sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division for investigation this morning.</p>
<h3>Zhongfu Bank</h3>
<p>Grand Theft Case Adjudicated</p>
<p>Sun Ruifu Married with Stolen Money</p>
<p>Therefore Gold Ornaments Must Also Be Recovered</p>
<p>Hu Honglai and Others Sentenced</p>
<p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday of the lunar calendar this year, the Zhongfu Bank on Renji Road was burglarized, and 21,000 yuan in paper money was stolen. After the bank discovered the theft, it reported it to the police and requested an investigation. Later, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui of the General Investigation Department arrested Wang Xiaohua, the main offender in the case, and handed him over to the First Special District Court, which sentenced him to one year and six months in prison. Subsequently, Chief Inspector Lu discovered that the mastermind of the case was Hu Honglai, a coppersmith from Anhui at the Zhongfu Bank, who had stolen the keys and committed the crime. After the case, Hu fled to Zhenjiang. Detective Chen Chenggui and Wu Hanzhang were dispatched to the Dahua Hotel in Zhenjiang, and arrested Hu and his accomplices, Sun Ruifu and Shi Haiquan, and brought them back to Shanghai for investigation and detention by the First Special District Court. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. Now, after investigation by the detectives, the stolen money borrowed by Hu et al. and the jewelry purchased with the stolen money have been successively recovered, totaling approximately 3,306 yuan in cash and jewelry. However, Sun Ruifu, after receiving his share of the stolen goods, used 300 yuan in cash and 1,100 yuan in jewelry to betroth Fang Linxiang (23 years old), daughter of Fang Meichun, who lived at No. 15 Derunfang, Er'erjin Road. When the police went to the Fang's house to retrieve the jewelry and cash, Fang refused. The police then requested the court to summon Fang Meichun to court. This morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the investigation in Criminal Division One. First, Fang Meichun and Fang Linxiang were summoned to the court. Under questioning, they admitted the facts but refused to return the gold jewelry, stating that if they had to return it, the marriage contract would have to be dissolved. The court stated that since it had been determined to be stolen goods, it should be returned. As for the marriage contract, it could be resolved separately according to law, and ordered the start of arguments. Attorney Yi Yaotang, representing the police, argued for severe punishment according to law. Judge Feng then announced the verdict in court, sentencing Hu Honglai to three years in prison, Sun Ruifu to two years and six months in prison, and Shi Haiquan to six months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</h3>
<p>Extending the Longhua Station Siding</p>
<p>To Avoid the Danger of Collisions</p>
<p>The original siding at Longhua Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was too short to accommodate long trains, making it prone to collisions. The Engineering Department had previously submitted a request to extend the siding to 360 meters. The Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry, which has now approved the request per Railway Ministry Order No. 121, instructing the Engineering Department to proceed with the plan.</p>

<h3>Kneeling Petition Group Kneels to Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Killing Off Modern Youths</p>
<p>The Industrial Society says: The National Soul Kneeling Petition Group, organized by patriotic youth Wang Hanchun, has only a few members since its establishment, but they are extremely diligent in their kneeling petition work. Regardless of the weather, their footprints are always on the sidewalks. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Wang Hanchun, a member of the group, was going to Pudong on business. While passing near the electric light company on Guohuo Road, he spotted a youth in a Western suit and leather shoes, accompanied by a modern young woman, walking arm in arm, dressed in foreign goods from head to toe. Although it was raining heavily at the time, he disregarded the mud and knelt down in front of them. The modern couple was terrified at the time, suspecting him to be a thief, and sternly rebuked him, saying, "You dare to swindle civil servants, you have no regard for the law!" Wang Hanchun, hearing this, gently explained the purpose of the kneeling petition. The youth realized their mistake and felt ashamed and embarrassed. After a long pause, they stammered, "We will no longer wear foreign goods in the future." Wang Hanchun then gave a salute and left.</p>
<h3>Four Rice Associations</h3>
<p>Petition to Retain Gong Xikui</p>
<p>Jiang Shizhi, chairman of the Shanghai Hub North Rice Transportation Merchants Lianyi Association, Jiang Zisheng, director of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association North Office, Zhu Ganxiang, chairman of the Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association, Zhang Songtao, chairman of the Shanghai Rice Grain Industry Association, and others presented a petition to Mayor Wu and Director Wen, stating, "Petition to earnestly request the retention of Director Gong, in order to be in accordance with emotions and encourage future endeavors. We find that on the evening of the first day of this year, the Tanziwan Road Xu Jintang's house robbery case in Zhabei was investigated and arrested by Director Gong Xikui of the Xinzha Branch Bureau upon hearing the alarm. The suspect confessed to the case details, which can be said to be a swift resolution. Furthermore, due to the involvement of patrol officer Tian Xiancheng in the case, he took the blame and impeached himself, which is even more evidence of his dedication to public service. His usual conduct is honest and upright, and he is diligent and honest in his duties. Not only local people praise him, but we believe that you, sir, have long appreciated him. Director Gong has served for many years and has risen through the ranks in an orderly manner before reaching his current position. His mistake should be treated with leniency in the name of public service, and he will be even more diligent and conscientious than before. After the incident, the local gentry and merchants believed that the swift resolution of the case and his dedication to public service would certainly invite the praise of the superiors. However, when news came that he had been suspended from his position, they were deeply disappointed. You, sir, have been rectifying your subordinates, strictly enforcing the principle of accountability for both virtues and faults. However, the punishment should not extend to the family, let alone if it is not his fault. We fear that diligent, honest, and loyal officials will lose heart upon hearing this news. If rewards do not encourage merit and punishments are not for the guilty, then it will not be enough to show encouragement and demonstrate official norms. On behalf of all members of the association, we dare to present this petition, earnestly requesting that you, sir, comply with emotions, retain Director Gong, and reinstate him immediately to satisfy public expectations and encourage future endeavors. We are extremely grateful." Respectfully submitted to: Wu, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government; Wen, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.</p>

<h3>Issue of China-Overseas Bank Returning Deposits</h3>
<p>Still Awaiting Approval from the Head Office Shareholders Meeting</p>
<p>Since the China-Overseas Bank's Shanghai branch announced its closure due to the influence of the head office, it has requested lawyer Song Yunhui and accountant Wang Sifang to be appointed as liquidators to carry out the settlement of accounts and file for record, in preparation for receiving and paying everything. The statement of assets and liabilities has long been sent to Hong Kong by airmail, pending the resolution of the shareholders' meeting held in Hong Kong yesterday, and the record-filing procedures. The First Special District Court has also approved and recognized it as a Chinese legal entity, and in law, it can be liquidated separately from the Hong Kong head office, which is only registered with the British government. The funds of the branch deposited in other banks can no longer be denied and must be transferred to the liquidators so that they can be repaid immediately. According to lawyer Song, if the Hong Kong shareholders' meeting can approve it now, approximately 40% of the deposits can be paid out within days.</p>

Excerpts from the agenda are as follows: (1) Regarding the joint petition from the Minhang Heji Opium Paste Shop and the Chunji Pinfen Smoking Shop to add two inspectors, with salaries subsidized by the merchants, there is no legal basis, and it is inconvenient to approve. If there is private trafficking or sales, it can be reported to the nearest Public Security Bureau at any time. (2) The position of director of the drug rehabilitation center, previously Dr. Yu was appointed as director on a trial basis.

<h3>Temporary Measures for Prohibiting the Transportation of Cattle</h3>
<p>Cattle Merchants Without Receipts Cannot Board the Train</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Railways to Be Followed by Both Railways</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways previously instructed both railways to investigate and respond on whether the "Temporary Regulations for Prohibiting the Transportation of Cattle" and their implementing rules implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Government would hinder the operations of the two railways. The Car Service Department investigated and found that there were no hindrances. However, the requirement to verify the "Cattle Inspection Fee Receipt" issued by the Jiangsu Department of Finance before loading caused issues, as sometimes the train had arrived at the station, and the cattle were urgently waiting to be loaded, but the receipt was delayed, making it impossible to issue freight bills. Merchants often thought that railway staff were deliberately making things difficult, leading to misunderstandings. The Railway Bureau forwarded a request for a solution, and the Ministry has now forwarded a reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that cattle merchants without receipts cannot board the train. If it is private transportation, the cattle merchant should be responsible. If the inspection has been completed but the receipt has not been issued, the inspection agency should be responsible. It cannot be considered that the Railway Bureau is deliberately obstructing. The Bureau has instructed the Car Service Department to be informed.</p>
<h3>Jin Cotton Charged at Fifth-Class Rate</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, stating that cotton is classified into three types: fine, ordinary, and coarse, according to the Ministry's regulations for freight charges, which have been instructed to be followed. Now, after investigating the prices of cotton from various producing areas in Jin, it is found that they are similar to the Ministry's standards for coarse cotton and should be included in the fifth-class freight charges to facilitate transportation and joint transportation. Now that the cotton-producing areas are expanding, if the freight charges have not been approved by the Ministry, the production area prices should be investigated and handled separately in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. In addition to telegramming Zhengtai and other railways, you should also follow these instructions. Minister Gu Mengyu, Yuanye Printing.</p>
<h3>Two People Freezing to Death Behind the Coal Slag Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at around 2:00 p.m., two unidentified male corpses were found frozen to death inside a shed behind the isolation hospital on Nanshi Station East Road (behind the coal slag road). One, about 30 years old, was wearing a blue cloth shirt and torn black cloth pants and was bald. The other, about 20 years old, was wearing a gray military uniform, an old felt hat, no pants, and was barefoot. The Station Road Police Station, in addition to reporting to the West Gate Branch Bureau, also notified the local Baojia for post-mortem examination. The charitable society prepared coffins for burial.</p>
<h3>Li Junhuan</h3>
<p>Founding of the Buddhist Studies Library and Public Reading Room</p>
<p>Layman Li Junhuan, for the sake of promoting Buddhism, donated funds to establish a Buddhist Studies Library and Public Reading Room. It officially opened on the 20th of this month at No. 92 Baocheng Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. It has collected hundreds of Buddhist books, and is open to the public for reading from morning to night every day. It is also open on Sundays and holidays. It opens the door to exhorting goodness and paves the way for propagating the Dharma. It will not be difficult to revive the declining social customs, and the sinking hearts of the people can be saved. However, because of his personal sincerity in propagating the Dharma, his strength is weak. Based on the principle of accumulating sand into a tower, he has to implore elders from all directions and virtuous people from the four continents to donate scriptures to cultivate this special cause, so that all beings can bathe in the Dharma and ascend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss together. Then the merits and rewards will be inconceivable.</p>
<h3>Dalian Maru</h3>
<p>Japanese Man Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea</p>
<p>Working in Lingyuan, Rehe</p>
<p>Is it a Venereal Disease or a Mental Illness?</p>
<p>On the Dalian Maru, a steamship belonging to the Dalian Steamship Company in this port, which arrived in Shanghai from Dalian this time, a Japanese passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Man Comes to Shanghai for Illness　　After the four northeastern provinces were occupied by the Japanese puppets, most of the telecommunications agencies were staffed by Japanese. Asakura Kazuo, a Japanese employee of the Lingyuan Telegraph Bureau in Rehe Province, was 26 years old. Because he was ill in the telegraph bureau and could not work, it was said that he was suffering from a venereal disease, but he claimed to have a mental illness. Recently, he asked for leave to go to Dalian, and then came to Shanghai from Dalian, intending to recuperate from his illness. Therefore, he took the Dalian Maru to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Suicide by Jumping into the Sea Midway, Report to the Consulate Upon Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Japanese man's cabin was a third-class cabin. When the ship arrived in Qingdao, it was confirmed that Asakura was still on the ship. On the 13th, when the Dalian Maru left Qingdao and set sail for Shanghai, there was heavy fog and the ship was sailing at sea. Due to his illness, the Japanese man sneaked out of the cabin and jumped into the sea in the dark of night to end his life. However, no one knew when he jumped into the sea. When the Dalian Maru arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the passengers disembarked. The person in charge knew that one passenger was missing. At first, they only knew that one passenger was missing from the ship. Later, after checking the passenger list, they realized that the missing person was a Japanese. Because he worked for the puppet country and was a civil servant, the ship notified the company, which reported to the consulate. The Shanghai consulate sent two inspectors to the ship to investigate and search the cabin where the Japanese man lived. They found a note left by him about jumping into the sea. Combined with the fact that the crew saw him in Qingdao, it was known that he committed suicide by jumping into the sea outside the port of Qingdao.</p>

<h3>Countries Compete</h3>
<p>Far East Kerosene Market</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Monopoly Falls to British and Dutch</p>
<p>Our Country's Authorities Have Long Paid Attention</p>
<p>British, American, and Russian countries compete for the Far East kerosene market. Since the implementation of the Japanese puppet monopoly policy, another situation has been created. Yesterday, I visited someone in the kerosene industry to inquire about the recent situation. According to the following three points he mentioned, the general trend of the Far East kerosene market in 1935 is clear at a glance. (1) Regarding the puppet country's monopoly policy, all parties have paid close attention to it since its promulgation, and there are many competitors. As a result, it was won by British and Dutch companies. (2) Japan's estimated kerosene demand for this year is 1.15 million kiloliters, and the quantity has been distributed to domestic and foreign companies. However, in order to protect its domestic kerosene industry, the government controls all prices, and the companies it trades with must keep six months of sales volume of oil. In case of emergency, the government can buy it back at a price. (3) The Chinese market has been affected by the recession in recent years, which is very different from the past. Sales have fallen sharply. Kerosene merchants in China have held many meetings to find ways to save the crisis. Our country's authorities have long been aware that kerosene is a very important item, and have been paying attention to the competition of kerosene from various countries in the Far East market. It is said that they have contacted a certain company in our country.</p>
<h3>National News Editorial Symposium</h3>

The attendees were Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Ren Jinping, Zhang Xuecheng, Wen Ronglu, etc. The focus of the discussion was on domestic cooperation, the Saar plebiscite, and the Sichuan bandit suppression. The attendees summarized the discussion and were responsible for writing articles separately. It is also heard that the company is offering preferential treatment to readers of the Life Weekly, giving away 2,000 copies of the first issue (ie, issue 84). It is now heard that as of the 15th, 2,377 copies have been given away. Those who send letters to request reading after the 16th will be given the second issue instead.</p>

<h3>Fire at Great Western Road</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 yesterday morning, a fire broke out in a bungalow at No. 44 Xinjie, Great Western Road, Caojiadu, Shanghai, due to careless cooking with a briquette stove, which caused a fire to accumulate wood and dense smoke filled the area, breaking through the roof. Fortunately, the Caojiadu branch reported to the nearby Caojiadu Fire Brigade, which rushed to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire. A total of two bungalows were burned. Director Wang sent police to the scene and detained Gong Zhangshi, the owner of the fire, for questioning.</p>
<h3>Inspection Report of Zhejiang Xingye Bank</h3>
<p>The 55th inspection report on the issuance reserve of Zhejiang Xingye Bank stated that the issuance of Zhejiang Xingye Bank has always been completely separated from the business aspect, and the reserve is sufficient. On the 16th of this month, the accountant Yan Ouke inspected and calculated that the cash reserve was more than 60%, and the guarantee reserve was less than 40%.

<h3>Ban</h3>
<p>Cigarette Giveaways Not Extended to the End of April</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association sent a letter to its member manufacturers, saying: "Dear Sirs, Shen Xin's two newspapers on January 13 reported that 'Nanjing's ban on cigarette giveaways has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be extended to the end of April.' A special telegram on the 12th is very different from the Ministry of Finance's approval. Our association's Chairman Shen and committee members personally inquired about the matter with the Tax Affairs Department to determine whether this news was true. After the inquiry, we received a letter from the Tax Affairs Department's Beijing office. We are copying the original text for your company's reference. Sincerely, Tobacco Company, including one copy of the original letter: 'Dear Sirs, your letter regarding the newspaper reports that various cigarette factories have again applied for an extension of the ban on giveaways in cigarette packs, which was approved on the 12th to be extended to the end of April, requesting an investigation and reply. I went to the Coinage Department to inquire, and they said that the department has not continued to handle this case. The newspaper reports may be a mistake for the end of February, etc. I am replying to you for your reference. Sincerely.'"</p>
<h3>Cheng Yujie</h3>
<p>Resigns as Chairman of the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association</p>
<p>Cheng Yujie, the chairman of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association, has been in charge of the association's affairs for three years. Last year, he also served as a supervisor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the chief supervisor of the Cosmetics Industry Association. Recently, it was heard that Mr. Cheng has been running around in society for many years, which has led to exhaustion. He specially sent a letter to the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association to resign. His original letter said: "Dear Sirs, I have been serving society for several years now. At first, I was in charge of the affairs of the Cosmetics Industry Association, and then I took care of the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry, which was as loose as sand. Without cohesion, it is impossible to strengthen oneself. Therefore, in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, I joined forces with my colleagues to initiate the organization of the association. During the preparatory period, I strictly investigated and sealed up inferior goods. After the association was established, such as fighting for business tax, donating to military needs, raising funds for aviation, proposing freight prices, formulating industry rules, and issuing monthly reports, I have always been sincere in my efforts. Fortunately, I have received the enthusiastic love of my colleagues and the joint efforts of the public. I have been able to avoid mistakes and can be satisfied. I have always dared not lag behind others in serving the public. In addition to the positions of chairman and supervisor, I have almost abandoned my personal career. In recent years, the market has been in decline, which has never happened before. If I do not focus on operating a production business and continue to work for others, I will lose sight of the other. I am terrified of the future. Therefore, I sincerely request to resign from the position of chairman and elect a replacement according to law, so as to benefit the association's affairs. I will still use my qualifications as a committee member to assist in any way I can. I am sending this letter to you, hoping you will understand. Sincerely, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association."</p>

<h3>Special Report</h3>
<p>Peng Xiangying</p>
<p>Lecture on the Relationship Between Citizens and Air Defense</p>
<p>The Sino-Western Broadcasting Station, the day before yesterday, broadcast a lecture by Mr. Peng Xiangying entitled "The Relationship Between Citizens and Air Defense." The arguments were quite detailed and insightful. The text of his speech is published below:</p>
<p>The term "air defense" has indeed attracted the close attention of many countries and many people in the world recently. However, the origin of this term is only a little over a decade old. Since the European War, when Germany, England, and France used airplanes against each other to participate in combat, attacking important locations in their enemy countries and destroying combat forces, using this as a means to subdue the enemy, this new term was born. The countries at war at the time suddenly suffered damage from aerial attacks from airplanes and felt that the current national defense equipment, without prior air defense equipment, was not qualified for combat. Therefore, all countries in the world are actively building air defense in order to protect national standing and territorial integrity. The people of all countries also deeply feel that the protection of life and property, in this era, cannot be hoped for without air defense equipment. Therefore, everyone is desperately assisting the government in engaging in air defense construction, and at the same time actively engaging in personal protective measures. Especially with the activity of this term, it has occupied a large place in people's minds, and at all times, due to this new stimulus, people are loudly shouting "Save us, save us!" Only "Air defense, air defense," is the effective method. This term, receiving such enthusiastic calls from people, has thus become particularly new and prosperous.</p>
<p>However, this emerging term has been extremely active in various countries around the world for the past ten years or so, but we in China have turned a blind eye to it. It was not until the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents occurred, when Japan used its new and superior airplanes to bomb our Jinzhou, bomb our Shanghai, and other places, especially in the airspace of Hongkou and Zhabei, carrying out massacres and burning countless of our houses, bombing and killing countless of our people, that this term, like countless sharp knives falling from the sky, gave us recognition, making us realize that airplane bombing is indeed something to be feared. Therefore, this newly emerging term "air defense," which had gone unnoticed in China for more than a decade, has gradually been appreciated by the general public, who recognize the necessity of paying attention to it.</p>
<p>However, there are still many people who believe that air defense equipment only needs airplanes and anti-aircraft guns to carry out aerial and anti-air defense, and that the responsibility for air defense should be entirely borne by the government and has nothing to do with the people. This misconception is entirely due to a lack of thorough understanding of the mission of the air force and the elements of air defense. We must know that the enemy's airplanes come from various heights and from all directions. No matter how complete our military air defense is equipped and how accurate the anti-aircraft gun firing is, it is not easy to drive all enemy airplanes away and shoot them down outside the city. At the same time, we still need our unarmed civilians to engage in passive defense in order to achieve the overall goal of air defense. For example, taking London at the end of the European War, which used twelve squadrons of air defense airplanes and four hundred anti-aircraft guns to defend its airspace as an example, can make us understand. At that time, although London had such great air defense equipment, 10% to 30% of enemy airplanes still took advantage of the gaps to invade London's airspace to achieve their bombing purposes. This is clear and irrefutable proof. Moreover, purchasing various anti-aircraft guns and fighter airplanes requires enormous expense. Given China's current economic situation, it will be difficult to purchase large quantities of air defense weapons in a short period of time. Therefore, in today's China, it is especially necessary to have comprehensive civilian air defense equipment, and it is even more necessary for the people to have automatic protective measures. Because civilian air defense can be organized completely, although it cannot directly confront enemy airplanes, it can indirectly avoid or reduce the damage suffered during enemy air raids. Because when enemy airplanes attack, the most terrifying things are the dropping of incendiary bombs and poison gas bombs. As for the power of explosive bombs, it is limited to the local area of the point of impact, and the harm it causes is limited. However, incendiary bombs or poison gas bombs are different. They can turn the essence of an entire city into ashes in an instant, and the lives of the entire city will immediately be buried in a poisonous tomb, creating a scene of scorched earth with nothing left. As for the harm of poison gas, everyone knows it. Due to time constraints, I cannot say more about it here. I can only briefly describe the fierce situation of incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>Incendiary bombs range in size from the same as hand grenades to weighing two to twenty kilograms. Depending on the purpose of use, some do not ignite upon contact, while others ignite only after a certain period of time. When they ignite, they can emit high heat of over three thousand degrees, and even objects such as steel can be melted immediately. The burning time can reach as long as fifteen minutes, and the spreading range can reach one hundred square meters, and it cannot be extinguished with water.</p>
<p>Today's bombers already have a carrying capacity of two thousand kilograms. If they are fully loaded with incendiary bombs weighing twelve kilograms each, they can carry at least one hundred and fifty. Flying over our cities, they can immediately destroy our prosperous streets and cause one hundred and fifty fires. If the attacking enemy airplanes are two, they can cause three hundred fires. Assuming that one-third of their impact points fail to hit, they can still cause fires in two hundred places. At this time, no matter how hard the fire brigade works and how sufficient the fire trucks are, they will be overwhelmed and unable to rescue. Moreover, when roads and bridges are destroyed at the same time, houses collapse, and communication lines are cut off, the fire trucks will be unable to function due to impaired mobility and communication, and the property and lives of the citizens will only be left to be destroyed by the fire.

<p>Next Year's Berlin World Games</p>
<h3>Astonishingly Grand Venue Construction</h3>
<p>Construction Cost of 10 Million Marks</p>
<p>Hitler Considers this Great Sporting Event</p>
<p>Related to the Dignity of the National Government</p>
<p>(National Telegram from Berlin, 14th) The immensely grand venue for next year's Berlin World Games is currently under construction. Many workers are actively working to ensure the completion of this great construction on time. The construction plan is entirely the idea of ​​the Führer Hitler. Since taking power, he has opposed repairing the original sports field. This field was originally built for the 1916 Games but was ultimately not held due to the European War.</p>
<h3>Overview of Various Construction Plans</h3>
<p>The current new plan is to completely eliminate the original construction, using only the foundations left behind. The new plan not only involves building a large sports field on the original site, but also building a large open grassland connected to the sports field for preliminary opening ceremonies, surrounded by large grandstands. There will also be an open-air theater, an independent large swimming pool, a cycling track, a large tennis court, twelve fields for football and hockey, and two elliptical tracks for practice. There will also be a small lake for swimming practice. Only the original sports hall in one corner will be preserved without demolition. A total of six state-of-the-art sports halls will be used for fencing and other indoor sports competitions. In addition to the above-mentioned tracks, grandstands, stables, water towers, etc., new roads leading to the sports field will be built, and two railway stations and underground stations will be built near the sports field to meet future transportation needs.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Number of Spectators</h3>
<p>The various constructions are all incomparably grand. The large sports field can accommodate 100,000 spectators, and the open grassland for the opening ceremony can accommodate 400,000 people. After the closing ceremony, this large grassland will be used for ordinary competitions. On the main grandstand around this large grassland, a "Hitler Tower" with a height of 60 meters will be built. In addition, there will be four high buildings, below which are the entrances and exits to the large grassland. The open-air theater can accommodate 20,000 people, the tennis court and swimming pool each 10,000 people, the cycling track grandstand 15,000 people, the race track 7,000 people, and each stable can accommodate 100 horses.</p>
<h3>Construction Cost of 10 Million Marks</h3>
<p>This great project is estimated to cost 10 million marks, part of which is subsidized by the government, and the rest comes from various sports associations. In order to raise this huge sum, a special tax is levied on tickets for various sports competitions. According to expert observations, 10 million marks may still be insufficient. However, funding is not a problem, because the government authorities and Hitler himself consider this great sporting event to be directly related to the dignity of the country and the government. Regardless of time or financial resources, they will do everything possible to make this great sporting event a success and unparalleled.</p>

<p>Under the Cultural Aggression of Violent Japan</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Education in Changchun and Shenyang</h3>
<p>Brainwashing Education by the Japanese Can Eliminate Nationalistic Ideas</p>
<p>The Environment Influences People; Northeastern Youths are Gradually Becoming Numb</p>
<p>(Northeast Society) Violent Japan, based on its past experience in Korea, believes that brainwashing education can eliminate nationalistic ideas. Therefore, it is vigorously promoting brainwashing education in the Northeast and understands that the cultural centers of the Northeast are Changchun and Shenyang. Therefore, it is especially exerting efforts in cultural aggression in these areas. How can innocent students deeply understand the cunning and poisonous intentions of the Japanese? In addition, the environment influences people, and they are gradually becoming numb, which is extremely distressing. The situation of brainwashing education in Changchun and Shenyang is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Changchun</h3>
<p>(1) In order to unify the educational circles in the Northeast and implement brainwashing education, the Japanese urged the puppet Ministry of Education to establish a teacher training institute (located in the old Jilin No. 2 Normal School in Shuangqiaozi, Changchun). It ordered the puppet education departments of various provinces to select incumbent primary and secondary school teachers and send them to the institute. The subjects of study are the spirit of nation-building, domestic situation, international relations, and Confucian education, among other items. Graduates complete the course in three months. Each person pays a food fee of 50 yuan. During the training period, they continue to receive their original salary. Six classes have graduated so far. The seventh class graduated at the end of last year, and the eighth class has already been selected by the puppet education departments of various provinces according to the instructions of the puppet Ministry of Education. They are required to report on January 7th of this year and start school on the 9th. (2) The puppet Central Army Training Center held a graduation ceremony for the first class of 74 military officers and quartermasters on December 24th of last year. Important puppets from the puppet organization attended in person, and several graduates who had received brainwashing military education gave speeches on their aspirations to strive to implement the puppet government in the future.</p>
<h3>Shenyang</h3>
<p>(1) The puppet Fengtian Provincial Department of Education received an order from the puppet Ministry of Education to clarify the students from various provinces and cities before the Incident, both government-funded and self-funded, especially paying attention to students studying in Guan Nei (the area south of the Great Wall), fearing that they would resist Japan and oppose Manchukuo. Therefore, it specially formulated an investigation form, which was attached to the puppet order. The deadline was the end of last year to complete the report and submit it to the puppet ministry. The so-called investigation items include: 1. Name of the country of study (those studying in Guan Nei are considered to be "studying in China" and are given special attention with a hostile mentality); 2. Name of the school of study; 3. Subject of study; 4. Number of students studying; 5. Monthly allowance. (2) The puppet Shenyang County Education Bureau, upon receiving a letter from the Japanese Consulate of the "Friendly Nation" (Japan), was ordered by the puppet Ministry of Education to conduct a detailed investigation of the status, occupation, and activities of those from "Manchukuo" who have studied in Japan after returning to the country, as well as a comparison with those who have studied in Europe and the United States, and to submit a report to the relevant cities and counties by the end of February of this year. The investigation items include: 1. Name; 2. School of study; 3. Major subject; 4. Current position, occupation, and activities. (3) The puppet Shenyang County Government, upon receiving an order from the puppet province forwarded by the puppet Ministry of Education, stated that the eighth teacher training session was approaching. The county had a quota of two places and should send trainees to the puppet capital for training. Regarding the selection of trainees in the county, the puppet Education Bureau has selected Wang Chunda, a teacher from the County No. 3 Primary School, and Zhang Junying, a teacher from the Yilukou Primary School. They will soon go to the puppet capital for brainwashing training. In addition, the puppet Shenyang County Government distributes subsidies for brainwashing education to its affiliated primary schools on a quarterly basis, in two installments. Distribution began at the end of last year, with each school receiving 75 yuan in puppet currency. After receiving the funds, the schools have returned to teaching brainwashing education. Furthermore, the puppet Shenyang County Government has stipulated that teachers' salaries be distributed in three grades. In order to encourage teachers to practice teaching brainwashing education, the ninth county affairs meeting of the county decided to newly re-establish the grades into five levels. The salary for the first grade is 32 yuan per month, the second grade is 30 yuan per month, the third grade is 28 yuan per month, the fourth grade is 26 yuan per month, and the fifth grade is 24 yuan per month. The implementation has been announced.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Dispatches Personnel</h3>
<p>To Inspect Qilu University in Jinan</p>
<p>Orders Reorganization of the School's Board of Directors</p>
<p>Rumors of Abolishing the College of Arts and Sciences Denied</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The private Qilu University in this city has been plagued by unresolved disputes within its board of directors since last year. Students of the College of Arts and Sciences staged two strikes and petitions, which were only resolved this month. Before President Mei Yi-bao arrived, Vice Chairman of the Board Li Zhifan temporarily acted as president. The student roster has now been submitted to the Education Department and forwarded to the Ministry of Education. Due to the repeated disturbances at the university, the Ministry of Education has dispatched Counselor Chen Shicong to Jinan to inspect the school. He also has the task of ordering the reorganization of the school's board of directors.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Board of Directors (1) Private university boards of directors are organized in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education in October of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932]. These regulations placed no restrictions on the number of directors, nor were there strict requirements for their qualifications. The Ministry of Education is now promulgating new regulations that limit the number of directors, with foreign directors not to exceed one-third of the total number. The board must be reorganized in accordance with the new regulations. (2) The division of powers between the board of directors and the president must be clarified. The board of directors should decide on matters to be implemented by the president and should not directly interfere with the president's administration. After arriving in Jinan, Chen has been in contact with the school's board of directors and president. The board of directors will soon be reorganized in accordance with the new regulations. It is reported that the number of directors will be fifteen, with ten Chinese directors and five foreign directors. There will also be strict restrictions on the qualifications of directors.</p>
<p>Inspection of Qilu University Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, Chen arrived at Qilu University for inspection. He was quite satisfied with the school's management. He also convened a meeting with all faculty, staff, and student representatives to discuss his mission to Jinan. Student representatives asked whether there was any talk of turning Qilu University's College of Arts and Sciences into a rural normal school. Chen said that there was no such thing and urged them to study with peace of mind and not believe rumors. The Ministry of Education is currently most concerned with normal school education, and only national institutions can run normal universities. Private institutions cannot. Qilu University is run by Western friends, and running a normal school would conflict with the Ministry of Education's position. Furthermore, ministry orders require that a university have three colleges to be called a university. If Qilu University were to abolish the College of Arts and Sciences, leaving only the medical school, the university would not be able to exist at all. Moreover, the curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences is too different from that of a rural normal school. Even if Qilu University has this idea, it must be submitted to the ministry, and the ministry would not approve it. Thus, the students were relieved. The acting president of the school, Li Zhifan, will host a banquet to welcome Chen today (the 15th) at 7:00 PM. Chen will return to Beijing to report on his mission within a few days.</p>
<h3>Central Antiquities Preservation Committee</h3>
<p>Appoints German Professor as Honorary Advisor</p>

During this visit to China, he drafted a plan for the renovation of ancient sites near Nanjing and submitted it to the Ministry of Education and the Antiquities Preservation Committee for reference. It is reported that Ershiman will return to his country within a few days and will come to China again in two years.</p>

<h3>China Women's Middle School Approved for Registration</h3>
<p>China Women's Middle School on Lin Yin Road, Ximen, has been established for more than a year by Wang Xiaoying, Li Dachao, and others.

<h3>Jiangsu's Social Education Facilities (3)</h3>
<p>(Report by Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Education, at the Provincial Government Memorial Week)</p>
<p>What has been said above are the important social education facilities in Jiangsu in the last two years. We have examined them from many angles and know that most county governments and education bureaus are able to meticulously plan and carry out social education. What deserves our attention most is the attitude of the staff serving in social education organizations. It has fundamentally changed. In the past, everyone thought that serving in social education organizations was very comfortable. Now, this concept has fundamentally disappeared. In the past, everyone did things casually. Now, whenever they do something, they know to draw up a plan in advance and follow it. In the past, attention was only paid to static work, which had nothing to do with the people. Now, they have gradually paid attention to dynamic work, which involves the people. In the past, the work was aimless. Now, everyone knows that standard work is the goal. Although it cannot be said that there are no institutions that are not achieving any results, in general, they have made much more progress than before. However, the staff serving in social education organizations have not yet truly gone to the people. We should also find ways to promote this in the future. Now, let me talk about our current plans.</p>
<p>The first is to redraw the guidance areas of the provincial people's education centers. In the past, the people's education guidance areas under the jurisdiction of the provincial people's education centers had too many counties, making guidance difficult. Now, the six districts have been redrawn into eight districts, and the Provincial Tangshan Farmers' Education Center, originally located in the second district, has been moved to the Nantong district. Another provincial people's education center will be added in the Donghai district to facilitate the guidance work of the provincial people's education centers. This has already been implemented.</p>
<p>The second is to effectively promote the standard work of social education organizations in various counties. Social education organizations in various counties have been able to pay attention to the implementation of standard work. This is a very good sign. However, they are still not very clear about the methods of implementation. Now, we are re-establishing a "Standard Work Promotion Plan" and ordering social education organizations in various counties to follow it. We are also ordering provincial social education organizations to provide effective guidance when guiding social education in various counties.</p>
<p>The second is to implement film education. In order to use film as a tool for implementing social education, we plan to pay special attention to film education this year. In addition to ordering provincial social education organizations to purchase film projectors and travel to various counties to screen films, we also plan to produce several types of films ourselves. The Drinking Water Hygiene, edited by the chairman, has been filmed and completed. Good Friends, Jiangsu Provincial Capital, etc., are being filmed.</p>
<p>The third is to try to combine administration and education. We know that the work done by social education organizations in various counties often overlaps with the work of district offices. As a result, social education organizations cannot fully promote their work due to the lack of political power. District offices cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the lack of educational methods. In order to remedy this shortcoming, we have, in conjunction with the Department of Civil Affairs, designated Kunshan, Yixing, Nantong, and other counties to try to have the director of the farmers' education center concurrently serve as the district chief in order to test the combination of administration and education. If the experiment proves successful in the future, it will be a great way out for our social education.</p>
<p>The fourth is to rectify social education organizations. In the past, the organization of provincial social education organizations was often inconsistent, and the organization of county social education organizations was also inevitably different. Now, we plan to formulate regulations and order a unified organization to facilitate management. Moreover, some county social education organizations have too little funding and cannot develop. We plan to try to increase funding as much as possible so that each institution has at least 2,000 yuan per year. If this cannot be done in the short term, we plan to gradually increase it in the future. As for county institutions with annual funding of more than 3,000 yuan, there is also inevitable waste. We will gradually reduce them in the future. As for other institutions with little achievement, we plan to reduce and merge them as appropriate in order to save money.</p>
<p>Fifth, we actively implement the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement can be said to be the implementation of civic training for the people. Social education organizations should work hard to promote it. We have already formulated a general outline of methods for social education organizations to promote the New Life Movement and ordered social education organizations to earnestly promote it. We will also step up supervision in the future so that the New Life Movement can achieve special results in social education.</p>
<p>In short, there are many areas in Jiangsu social education that need to be improved, and we still need to work hard. (End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Chinese Middle Schools to Hold Joint Examination</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council-run Chinese Middle Schools have not yet participated in joint examinations. The Council's Education Committee has organized a subcommittee to consider the method for the Council-run Chinese Middle Schools to hold graduate joint examinations. It is now reported that the committee has submitted three recommendations to the Education Committee: (1) The five Chinese Middle Schools established by the Council should hold a joint examination at a public location in June 1935. The questions should be within the scope of the current curriculum and should have been studied by all the students participating in the examination. There should also be optional or alternative questions so that the scope is sufficient to adapt to the situation of each school. (2) The issue of having external personnel examine certain subjects should be discussed after the above examination has been held, and it is known to what extent the curriculum has been standardized, and how many students from the schools established by the Council are participating in the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Examination. (3) Students should be encouraged to participate in the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Examination. It is reported that the above recommendations have been approved by the Education Committee and adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words Hides Tears, Selling Self to Explain Hardship, Carefully Peering at Invitation, Seeking Refuge with Eagerness</p>
<p>So he waved his hands one after another, meaning to call him over. Li Shilian saw it, but unfortunately, this collision made his whole body lose consciousness. He couldn't move, so he had to pretend to be thinking about something and smiled at Zhang Jiefu. Then, he still raised his head and looked at the sky. Zhang Jiefu and he had also met in Tongguan. As friends in initial contact, he naturally did not want to ask him why he was distracted here. Moreover, he himself had a different purpose, so he could not ask loudly. He had to shrink his head and turn back to the room. But in less than five minutes, he stretched it out and looked. Li Shilian stood there for a long time. His spirit recovered, so it was not good to ignore him all the time. He followed his beckoning and walked into his room. Zhang Jiefu closed the door and immediately grabbed his hand, whispering, "I have heard everything you said to Mr. Cheng. Since he knows both Director Gao and Director Yuan, we can take this opportunity to proceed. What do you think? What idea did you come up with when you were just distracted?" Li Shilian thought to himself, "I have just explored a way out, and you want to proceed. If you have such an opportunity, would you be willing to carry me with you? You hateful thing." So he laughed and said, "Of course! We are all from the East. It is rare to meet here. Wouldn't it be good if we could work together?" He lowered his voice and said, "It's just that this Mr. Cheng has some strange temper. Would he be willing to help us as a friend?" Zhang Jiefu said, "If we just ask him to introduce things, that would naturally be too early. We just want him to mention us in front of the two directors, so that we can get the opportunity to meet and talk. We were originally going to ask someone to write an eight-line introduction. Now that we have seen the directors, let them leave an impression of us in their minds. Then, after an eight-line introduction, they will think that there is such a person, which is not bad."

<h3>A Short History of the Gangly Boar</h3>
<p>— By Qingqu</p>
<p>Sir, surname (Zhu), given name (Luo), born in the year of the Pig, therefore styled (Shi), or it is said that he was born after four months in the womb, and also because he ate unclean food, so he was assigned to (Shi), but it is not known which is true; considering Yang Xiong's Dialects, (Shi, Guandong, also called (　), always lives with the mother hen, which is pleasing to the farmer. The record says (if the (Shi) is fat, then the bristles will be strong and large, (from this, the three words (Gangly Boar) became famous in the world. However, Sir's endowment was foolish and lacking in thought, people thought he was tame and easy to raise, and fed him with bean dregs every day, gradually growing stronger, preventing him from escaping, planting his hat, but Sir slept when he was full, and ate again when he woke up, in less than half a year, he produced children, as many as twenty-four, the keeper was overjoyed, saying, (This is the foundation of wealth,) In the past, Fan Li used animal husbandry to scatter his family wealth three times, calling himself (Duke Zhu), his art was not without reason.</p>
<p>Later, Chen Ping of the Han Dynasty slaughtered his meat and divided it evenly in the community, and eventually became a prime minister. During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhang Yide used this as his career, and was able to become sworn friends with Liu Bei and Guan Yunchang, all of which Sir mediated. It is a pity that Sir is fond of dirt, his residence is called (sty) every day, and the smell is unbearable to approach, but his dung and urine can be used as fertilizer, and crops rely on it. There is nothing to be discarded; although it is like a dirty ruin, it is regarded as a treasure trove.</p>
<p>Sir's body is fat, and his face has many wrinkles. The connoisseur said (almost the appearance of a long life), how can it be the end of the six domestic animals, and they are all inevitable, Muhammad, who saved his life with compassion, and the rest, even if they persuade him to put down the knife, he can become a Buddha on the spot, but in the end he refuses to listen, saying; (If you want to know the world's knives and soldiers, just listen to the sound of the slaughterhouse in the middle of the night,) that is, Sir's last moment; alas! Sir is also pitiful. After Sir died, his corpse was no different from being torn apart, with his shoulders and hooves displayed in the market, and even cut into pieces, those who eat it are naturally unmoved in their hearts. This year's cycle is (Yihai), (Yi), like the shape of a knife, all newborns, according to the zodiac, belong to Sir. Sir is an ominous term, and as an example, the year of Yin belongs to the tiger, which is originally a lion, then those who belong to the pig should be changed to belong to the elephant, which is also possible, but then Sir will rest!</p>
<p>The reporter said, (Zhu Luo), pig slave; in the past, Huang Bi was the president, living in the White House, Wu Zhihui posthumously titled him (fattening pig), which is what pig slave means? However, Zhu Bajie, met Tang Seng, even Sun Wukong, can not do anything; (Gangly Boar), how can there be no Buddha-nature? It is a pity that people do not awaken themselves, but taste the essential meaning of mutual harm in the co-existence of all things.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Ping)</p>
<p>The return of Saar to Germany, already formally announced by the Hall of Warriors, this world-shaking election has unveiled the dawn of European peace. A sky full of overcast skies has vanished in a single morning. The humiliation of the Germans after the war, after fifteen years of hard work, has been completely washed away. Their nationwide celebration is only natural.</p>
<p>Saar returns to Germany, but what about the Northeast? This is what the Chinese people should be thinking. The people of Saar endured humiliation during this period, never forgetting their homeland for a single day. In this election, as many as 90% voted in favor of returning to Germany. This is an excellent lesson for our compatriots in the Northeast! I believe that the best way to recover the Northeast is to avoid force, and to have the League of Nations propose and implement elections to determine who the Northeast belongs to.</p>
<h3>Rainy Winter Night</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The winter night rain is always drifting so unhurriedly, so gently, like fine dust. The electric lights on the telegraph poles are a hazy white, as if shrouded in a thick fog, appearing only as a silent ball of white light as big as a watermelon.</p>
<p>Most of the neon lights in front of the big shops are already extinguished, even though it is only ten o'clock in the evening. Occasionally, one or two shops have not yet turned off their neon lights, but the shop assistants in the counters have their hands in their sleeves, resting on the counters in a daze, quietly listening to the lullabies being broadcast on the radio.</p>
<p>The banners for the winter sale have faded in color from the rain. Water drips from above, green drips, onto the shoulders of hurried and staggering pedestrians.</p>
<p>The streets are so muddy that when cars drive by, sewage flies onto the faces of pedestrians on the sidewalks with the wheels.</p>
<p>The air is so dull; if it weren't for the beggar with a cigarette butt in his mouth and an offensive odor emanating from his body, causing awkwardness behind them, pedestrians might suspect that they were in London, rather than in this first metropolis of the East.</p>
<p>The shouts of the boys selling evening newspapers trembled weakly under the lazily glowing red and green lights at the intersection, trembling on the sparsely populated sidewalks. The evening newspapers were full of moisture and were particularly heavy.</p>
<p>In front of a certain hotel, rickshaw pullers sat on the muddy pedals waiting for customers, idly chatting.</p>
<p>"Damn it, if this rain keeps up for three more days, my whole family will starve to death," one of them muttered.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? I only pulled eight 'xiaobaokai' yesterday. After paying the rent, I didn't even have money for pancakes. Today, I've only pulled a little over one string of cash..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a shout of "rickshaw" came from the entrance of the hotel, interrupting their conversation, and they scrambled to push their rickshaws forward.</p>
<p>But apart from one of them who pulled a customer away, the rest remained sitting on the muddy pedals, breathing heavily, watching the unhurried rain drifting like fine dust.</p>
<h3>Do Not Repeat Past Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<h3>Nine Out, Thirteen Back</h3>
<p>— Huang Quan</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw an article about pawnshops in Europe in the "Chunqiu" magazine, which couldn't help but remind me of the "Nine Out, Thirteen Back" practice in pawnshops in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>What is "Nine Out, Thirteen Back"?</p>
<p>When I was in Guangzhou, I often had to go into pawnshops. My belief was: "Those who pawn and redeem are upper class, those who pawn but don't redeem are middle class, and those who neither pawn nor redeem are lower class." Therefore, I was not ashamed to go into pawnshops, and I dared to discuss prices with the pawnshop clerks and even chat a few extra words.</p>
<p>In my conversations with the clerks, I learned about the so-called "Nine Out, Thirteen Back."</p>
<p>When you take an item to a pawnshop to pawn, it is explained that it can be pawned for one dollar, and the pawn ticket clearly states one dollar, but they only give you ninety cents, giving you a 10% discount for no reason. This is called "Nine Out." When you take the pawn ticket to redeem the item, you need to add thirty cents to them, meaning that to redeem the item early, it will cost you one dollar and thirty cents. This is called "Thirteen Back."</p>
<p>Many times I argued with the pawnshop clerks, but they said, "This is the industry rule, it's up to you whether you want to pawn or not," leaving you with no choice. You only go to pawn things when you are very poor! What choice do you have but to swallow your anger and pawn?</p>
<p>"Nine Out, Thirteen Back" is indeed a practice of heavily exploiting the poor. The Guangdong government has issued orders to prohibit it several times, but most pawnshops still follow it in secret.</p>
<p>Correction: In last Saturday's "Miscellaneous Notes" (Winter in Zizilou), the character "子" (zi) in the title was a mistake and should have been "子" (zi). We hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Royal Fragrance Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is specifically prepared for beginners in archery! Because in order to require the arrows shot out to have an accurate direction, the first thing that must be emphasized is the posture of shooting; and in order to emphasize the posture of shooting, it is necessary to first pay attention to the position of the two arms, neither too high, nor too low, that is, it is necessary to hold the bow just right. Although the words are very simple, learning it is really very difficult, and it is not something that teachers can teach verbally; you must do your own hard work; if you want to do hard work, these two suspended iron rings are an excellent auxiliary product! Everyone who learns archery cannot hope to improve without relying on them! The reason is that people's shoulders are very easy to move, and when raising the bow, they often cannot avoid being too high, too low, or biased, and cannot always maintain a proper position. So, from the beginning of learning, use these two iron rings to shape him. First, put both hands through the iron rings, so that his shoulders are lifted up by the iron rings. At the same time, the person guiding him should also adjust the length of the two ropes tied to the rings, either raising them a little or lowering them a little, always making them just right, and then handing the bow and arrow to him, letting him learn time after time under the restraint of these two iron rings. The arrow will go through this back door and fall onto the archery lane; at first, it is just random shooting without any target, only seeking to make his posture accurate; after a considerable period of time, his posture will have become natural due to the long-term restraint of the iron rings. In this way, he can leave the iron rings and go to the archery lane to concentrate on learning the method of shooting with targets. You probably never thought that learning archery would require such hard work)!</p>
<p>This is another new lesson we have never heard of before! I really cannot help but secretly admire the Empress Dowager's extensive knowledge! Later, she herself told me that she was able to acquire these scattered and mixed knowledge entirely from reading more books, which shows that reading is a very good habit! (224)</p>
<p>World Rare News</p>
<p>The World's Most Expensive Idol The basement of the Tarragona Municipal Bank in Spain now houses the world's most expensive idol, valued at one million yuan, because this idol was unearthed in the tomb of a child who died three hundred years before the Christian era. It is carved entirely from marble, no more than three inches long, with a face like an ape, exquisite and beloved.</p>
<p>Heavy Taxes on Single People Everyone who has been to Europe knows that single people are not only looked down upon by society, but also subjected to various forms of abuse by the government. Recently, Yugoslavia has enacted a law stipulating that all men and women over the age of thirty who are not married must pay heavy taxes. The Ministry of Communications grants newly married travelers the right to enjoy half-price fares on domestic railways. However, although the country encourages marriage in every possible way, the number of marriages is still not high, which is a symbol of social depression.</p>
<p>Wives and Concubines Sold Cheaply The natives of the Transvaal region of South Africa regard wives and concubines as a major asset. The more they keep, the more solid their assets are said to be. If they are in financial straits, they can transfer them to others, and they can also purchase them at any time when they have money. Recently, due to the global economic downturn, the selling price of wives and concubines has plummeted, and they are not even worth half the price of cattle. Top-quality young women are only sold for a maximum of sixteen pounds, second-quality for ten pounds, middle-aged women between thirty and twenty-five years old for six pounds each, and middle-aged women over thirty years old to thirty-five years old for only two pounds. However, cattle in that area also sell for three pounds each, so people are less valuable than cattle.</p>
<p>World's Highest Telephone There is a small house from Shangmari to Chuabolerezia Mountain in the Alps. There is a telephone installed in this house, which leads to major cities in Europe. The telephone is 9,680 feet above sea level, which is the highest place in the world to install a telephone. Recently, a radio station has been installed outside the house, which will also surpass the height of all radio stations in the world.</p>
<p>World's Largest Family Mr. Jiang Siqi Situnade of the American Box has reached the age of eighty-six, and there are one hundred and twenty-eight people in his family, which is a new record unheard of in the United States. In his sixty-six years of marriage, he has given birth to eleven sons, thirty-six grandsons, seventy-five great-grandsons, and four great-great-grandsons, totaling one hundred and twenty-eight people, including sons-in-law and grandsons-in-law.</p>
<p>City Found in the Desert In the Black Zhilamad area of ​​the southern Arabian Desert, a civilized city was recently discovered by German explorers. This city is in the middle of the desert, looking like a small island. Its construction is very large-scale, the streets are clean, and the drainage facilities are very complete. There are high-rise buildings in the middle, all built of brick and green bricks. The soil around the city is fertile and suitable for various plantings. It is really a natural paradise.</p>
<p>World's Largest Locomotive The St. Gotthard Railway in central Switzerland, which connects with Italy, is now using a locomotive unheard of in the world, because the method of running on steep slopes in mountainous areas uses an 8,800-horsepower electric locomotive. This locomotive weighs 240 tons and can stop suddenly when traveling at a speed of 40 miles per hour. It is equipped with 16 of the latest motors, surpassing the 7,125-horsepower largest locomotive previously boasted by the United States. (Bing Yu)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the (Student National Goods Year)</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The wheel of time has finally quickly rolled away the disaster-ridden (Women's National Goods Year), and the (Student National Goods Year) that follows has begun to unveil its prelude. From women to students, a new page has been added to the history of the National Goods Movement. We who are generally engaged in national goods cannot help but have a new wish to find a bright way out from the dark journey. Now, let us make a new prospect on the four words (Student National Goods)!</p>
<p>Students are the backbone of society and the reserve force of the knowledge class. Now, we gather the number of students in large, middle, and small schools across the country to promote this national goods movement. This power is of course great, but we must also know that the number of women last year was not small, but the results obtained were like this. Then, for the planned future of this year, we must have a more precise consideration. Obviously, the only bottleneck currently hindering the progress of national goods is that the psychology of worshiping foreign goods has not been abandoned. Women are like this, and students are also like this. Therefore, this point must be recognized first.</p>
<p>According to past facts, university students cannot avoid this (initiation) responsibility for the formation of the psychology of worshiping foreign goods. Whether male or female, they always compete for glory and victory because of their high degree of vanity, beautify the European style, and adopt it as much as possible. From universities to middle schools, from primary schools to society, the whole country is following the trend, leading to the current irreparable situation. Therefore, although we cannot say that the responsibility for the flooding of foreign goods should be entirely borne by the students, at least in the future development of our national products, we must fundamentally cut off this bad psychology.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the prospect of the (Student National Goods Year), the first thing that is needed is a change in the psychology of the students. We must know what time it is now. The dumping of foreign goods has reached the stage of swallowing up the vitality of our entire nation. Do we still want to dream of material enjoyment? To save the nation, we are not even afraid of throwing our heads and spilling our blood. Is it impossible to work together with the people to keep foreign goods a thousand miles away? The students across the country who are standing at the forefront of the times and are rich in knowledge have already had such a deep understanding.</p>
<p>Finally, I have great hope that the students will assume this dual responsibility. The first is to resist foreign goods from the standpoint of consumption, carry out organized publicity, and plan to stop it, (tie the bell and untie the bell), so that the people of the whole country can be transferred to establish confidence in using national goods. The second is to seek the development of national goods from the standpoint of production. Starting this year, we will work harder to explore and research production skills and enrich our knowledge in preparation for serving the society and the country in the future. In this way, our (Student National Goods Year) will not be in vain, and the recovery of the economic crisis will be hopeful.</p>
<h3>Plan for Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang Xie Li</p>
<p>Last year was the Women's National Goods Year, but according to the report released by the customs, the import of luxury goods such as perfumes, cosmetics, and jewelry used by women last year exceeded two million yuan. Therefore, everyone is scolding the Women's National Goods Year for having no achievements! This year is the Student National Goods Year, and this responsibility will be passed on to our students. I think our students are all young and strong, and full of competitiveness. How can we be willing to fall behind and be despised by others! However, everything is valuable to have a plan first, and then there is hope for success. Now, let me talk about my personal plan for promoting national goods.</p>
<p>Before I talk about my plan, I must first explain my background. I am a college student at Wuxi Education College. The Education College is famous in the world for its dedication to public education and its engagement in rural movements. It pays great attention to the development of students' thrifty and hardworking living habits, and stipulates that all students who are about to graduate must go to the countryside for internships and go deep into the people. I am one of those who have been immersed in public education for more than three years and have now come to work in the countryside. Therefore, it is not a problem for us people not to use foreign goods at all. My plan is how to promote national goods among the people? I plan;</p>
<p>(1) To change the people's love psychology The first important thing for us to come to the countryside is to get close to the people, so that the people trust you, and then we can guide them on the right track through subtle influence. We have spent a lot of effort in this area in the months since we came to the countryside, and now we have almost become one with the people, and there is a phenomenon that the people follow us everywhere.</p>
<p>We have always not used foreign goods, as I have already said. In the future, we can further lead by example, purchase and use national goods, change the people's vision, and change the people's psychology, or we can use the people's trust to change customs! Moreover, the so-called (fashion) has no certain standard, but is just a trend of the times. Why is it difficult for us to take using national goods as a fashion?</p>
<p>(2) To improve the people's national concept The people in the countryside have a very weak national concept, so they fundamentally do not know what (national goods) and (foreign goods) are. They are even more inexplicable about the principles of resisting foreign goods and promoting national goods. Therefore, when we educate the people, we must pay attention to improving the people's national concept; we must explain the facts of patriotic people and the historical sites of national heroes to the people. It is best to give the people a general idea of the current international situation and the crisis in our country's future.</p>
<p>(3) To instill in the people the common sense of national goods The people do not pay much attention to the types of foreign goods, and only choose cheap, clever, and beautiful things when buying, so they are most easily exploited by unscrupulous merchants, and often buy foreign goods without knowing it. Therefore, we must help them identify things everywhere, or gather foreign goods for use together with a few families as specimens for the public to visit, reduce the opportunity for the public to be fooled; or collect daily national goods, hold exhibitions, explain their advantages to the people, and instill in them the common sense of national goods.</p>
<h3>Safeguarding State-Run Industries</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>The treatment and protection given by our government to factories operated by foreign merchants is more favorable than those operated by our own people. The donations and taxes borne by foreign-owned factories are often lighter than those of Chinese-owned factories. Therefore, in the market, the products of domestic factories are more expensive. It is difficult to compete with foreign factories. Take sulfuric acid as an example. There are only two factories in Shanghai that manufacture sulfuric acid, one is the Jiangsu Chemical Plant operated by British merchants, and the other is the Kaicheng Acid Plant run by Chinese. The raw materials used by these two factories are imported and taxed in the same way. Kaicheng failed to get an exemption. As for the sulfuric acid produced, the tax levied by the Jiangsu Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau is one yuan per box. The Jiangsu Chemical Plant can refuse to pay because it is operated by foreign merchants. However, the products of Kaicheng must be paid as usual. Therefore, the cost per box is increased by one yuan, and the selling price must be equal to that of foreign goods. Otherwise, it cannot compete for sales. Recently, starting on January 1, the government has increased the spirit tax. All those run by foreign merchants inside and outside the concession do not have to pay, while those run by Chinese merchants must pay as usual. Otherwise, the spirit tax bureau will send staff to the factory to monitor and prohibit sales. As a result, the cost per gallon of Chinese-owned spirit factories is one yuan higher than that of foreign goods. There is no way to compete. The above situation is the opposite of the argument raised by the English-language Greater America Evening News editorial on January 9 that the Chinese government is treating foreign-owned factories harshly. Recently, all countries in the East and West have increased import taxes on products that can be fully supplied by their own country, or the government gives special bonuses to protect them. Therefore, maintaining domestic industry is always considering national defense. All countries in Europe and the United States are adopting this policy to deal with Japan, and Japan is adopting this policy to deal with all countries in Europe and the United States. The biggest reason why domestic industry in China cannot be developed today is that the government has failed to fully implement this protective policy. Unfair words should come from the injured Chinese merchants, not from the privileged foreign merchants. It is strange that tigers and wolves eat cattle and sheep, and the tigers and wolves make a sad sound. What the Chinese people hope from the government is not to drive out tigers and wolves, but to build defensive equipment to protect cattle and sheep from the harm of tigers and wolves. Otherwise, the emerging industry will never have the hope of growing up. How can the country rely on foreign goods to survive? I deeply hope that my authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Using National Goods</h3>
<p>— Liu Ping Ji Chen</p>
<p>After years of economic invasion by the great powers, all production enterprises in our country have disintegrated as a result. As far as national goods are concerned, although the government has tried its best to promote them, and people from all walks of life have worked together, such as setting (National Goods Year), (Women's National Goods Year), and (Student National Goods Year) to call on them, the result is still unable to resist the import of foreign goods. The reason for this is mostly that the Chinese people do not like to use national goods. And domestic goods manufacturers and companies also have many shortcomings in terms of production and sales. At the beginning of the Student National Goods Year, all my people, in addition to personally using national goods as an example, should persuade family and friends to advocate national goods together. Here, I will describe my views as far as I can see;</p>
<p>(1) Improve the goods It is well known that domestic goods in our country are durable. However, in terms of manufacturing, they stick to the old methods and do not seek improvement, or they are crudely made and shoddy, and materials are cut corners. Compared with European and American products, they are inevitably inferior. This is why Chinese people abandon domestic goods and buy foreign goods. In the future, domestic goods must be made as exquisite as foreign goods, and even surpass imported goods. National goods sales will increase by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>(2) Reduce prices National goods are in the budding stage. Due to the dumping of foreign goods and devaluation, those who generally like to use foreign goods are flocking to them. If the prices of national goods are too high, then everyone will stop. We should hold on to the principle of small profits, reduce costs, and make everyone have the impression that national goods are cheap and beautiful. Then, the promotion of national goods will be easier and more effective.</p>
<p>(3) Ensure credibility There are indeed many honest and trustworthy merchants in our country, but occasionally there are one or two merchants who sell inferior goods at high prices, or sell fake goods to counterfeit brands; they do not hesitate to use slippery methods to deal with customers. This kind of behavior completely loses the merchant's moral credibility. The failure of domestic goods is also affected by this. We should set a fixed price, and the goods should be of real value to protect credibility.</p>
<p>(4) Train shop assistants I have seen that in Japanese stores, the staff treat customers with kindness and politeness, doing their best to be polite. On the contrary, the staff in our country's stores treat customers with no sincerity, and even are arrogant, especially the staff in large stores have the worst habits. I think that male and female shop assistants should be strictly trained so that everyone has commercial experience and develops a gentle personality. When customers come, they should be treated warmly and respectfully. If everyone is satisfied, why worry that customers will not be overflowing and guests will feel at home?</p>
<p>(5) The way of publicity Commercial competition is nothing more than publicity. The reason why foreign goods can be sold well in our country's market is mostly due to the two words "publicity." Our country's approach to this is only to brag in advertisements, which has little effect. We should add male and female propagandists who are good at communication and have rich experience to go deep into the people and give practical advice to arouse their patriotism, so that everyone knows it. Oral and paper publicity should be carried out at the same time, then the effect will be significant.</p>
<h3>Welcome Student National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>In a strong country, the people have a natural duty to use their own goods. Only the Chinese need promotion and publicity to use their own goods. It is a shameful thing to say (Let them laugh and scold! I will buy foreign goods myself!). From National Goods Year to Women's National Goods Year, the number of imports of cosmetics and perfumes has become even worse! Promotion and publicity seem to be redundant!</p>
<p>As things change, the (Student National Goods Year) set by various organizations has appeared before our eyes. Who does not know that students are the most sober-minded and patriotic elements who have made contributions? The past May Fourth Movement has left the most glorious page in Chinese history! Therefore, in the (Student National Goods Year), relying on students to be the driving force for selling national goods will surely have very satisfactory results! And students in various commercial organizations should especially unite and stand on the same front!</p>
<p>Interview Notes</p>
<h3>Record of an Inspection of the Nanyang Market (2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>丨A Conversation with Mr. Kangyuan Xiang丨</p>
<p>(Question) Since the Japanese have expanded the Nanyang market, what countermeasures has the colonial government taken?</p>
<p>(Answer) Apart from the British and Dutch colonies in the Nanyang Islands, such as the American Philippines and French Annam, there have long been extremely high tariff barriers to prevent the large-scale import of goods from non-sovereign states. Therefore, it is difficult for Japan to satisfy its desires in these two places. British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies deeply feel that the dumping of Japanese goods affects the development of their own industries and commerce. Recently, they have successively implemented controlled trade to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Therefore, Japanese goods in the Nanyang market have been greatly impacted, and Japanese merchants have been panicked, and have requested their government to negotiate with the British and Dutch colonial authorities. However, the British government is determined to protect its original market for major industries, such as Lancashire textiles, and therefore seems to have a great determination to restrict the import of Japanese cotton products into British colonies in Nanyang. Therefore, although the Japanese side has protested several times, it has had no effect. As for the Dutch side, since the Dutch East Indies government announced the import restriction law for 56 kinds of commodities, the Japanese side protested severely. In order to ease the sharp conflict, a Japanese-Dutch conference was convened. However, this conference, which has been opened for several months, has been developing and tense at times, but has not made any progress so far. Under this harsh environment, Japan is not willing to sit still and wait for death. It has to find another way in Nanyang to seek a way out for its commodities. They are really thinking hard and striving hard, and as a result, they have obtained a new market with great prospects for expansion. What is this new market? It is Siam. When it comes to Siam, everyone knows that it is the only independent country in Nanyang, located on the Indochina Peninsula northeast of the Malay Peninsula. It has an area of about 195,000 square miles and a population of about 10 million. The people are engaged in agriculture. Except for rice mills and sawmills, other light and heavy industries are extremely backward, so it is the best market for industrial products. Siam also has considerable political contact with Japan in secret. For example, when the League of Nations General Assembly expressed its denial of the puppet state last year, the representatives of all member states unanimously voted against it, while the Siamese representative abstained, expressing goodwill towards Japan. Therefore, when Japan is now restricted by various colonial countries in Nanyang from importing its commodities, it has to expand its market to Siam in order to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>(Question) Now, can the promotion of domestic goods to Nanyang proceed smoothly?</p>
<p>(Answer) I think that if domestic goods want to develop in Nanyang, in addition to striving for excellence and applicability of the goods themselves, the first is to have political power to protect them, the second is to sign commercial treaties with local governments and send envoys and consuls; and the third is to solve the transportation problem. If we Chinese businessmen want to find a way out abroad by relying solely on our own strength, political protection may not be effective. Compared with Japanese businessmen in this regard, we are far behind. There are several places where we have not yet sent consuls to sign commercial treaties (such as Siam and Annam), and there are many obstacles to trade. They can freely levy taxes or reject the import of goods, and you have no way to deal with it. Sometimes, if there are any negotiations, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will act expediently, but the Chamber of Commerce is not a diplomatic opponent, how can it speak on behalf of others, and they may not pay attention to it. In my opinion, these two points must be resolved as soon as possible! As for transportation, it is also very important. Japanese goods are transported by Japanese national ships, which can be said to be without any difficulty. Our domestic goods have to rely on foreign ships for transportation, and the freight will of course increase. For example, the freight for Japanese goods to Siam is six yuan per ton, while our domestic goods require 20 yuan, the difference is huge.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current situation of industry and commerce of overseas Chinese in Nanyang?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the two waves of rubber and tin ore in the Nanyang market in recent years, the market has been very depressed. The large-scale businesses of Chinese businessmen are mostly shaken, especially small businesses, which are not easy to maintain their original state. For example, a tree, the large-scale industry and commerce is the trunk, and the small industry and commerce is the roots. The trunk and the roots are interdependent and help each other. There is no case where the roots are shaken and the trunk does not shake. If you want to strengthen the foundation, you must first cultivate the roots. Therefore, I think these basic forces must be cultivated to be healthy.</p>

<h3>Spring Grass and Poetry</h3>
<p>— Ruo Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Jing'an Wang wrote this in "Human Words on Poetry": (People know that Hejing's "Dian Jiang Chun", Shunyu's "Su Mu Zhe", and Yongshu's "Shao Nian You" are three masterpieces for chanting spring grass, but they do not know that the five words "fine rain wets flowing light" by Zhengzhong came first, which can capture the soul of spring grass.) This is of course a very worthwhile remark. Spring grass in poetry is really full of imagery. In the time of February and March in Jiangnan, looking at the lush grass, it is easy to make people feel a kind of desolate loneliness. Writing about spring grass can be said to be a characteristic of Chinese literati, perhaps due to temperament and environment! In addition to the few verses Wang mentioned, we can also see Qin Shaoyou's ("Leaning on a dangerous pavilion, hatred is like fragrant grass, lush and endless.") and Mei Shengyu's another verse chanting grass "Shao Nian You"; ("The railing twelve alone by spring, the clear blue extends to the clouds, thousands of miles, February and March, the journey is bitter and sad.") are all full of a faint sense of sorrow. As for Li Meixi's "Liu Yao Ling" in the Yuan Dynasty ("Vaguely distant fragrant grass, dyed the spring breeze green.") is good, but the artistic conception is completely different. In the nineteen ancient poems, ("Green grass by the riverbank") and ("Looking around, what is vast, the east wind shakes the grass.") are both sentences that evoke a sense of life. There are no abstract explanatory words such as resentment and hatred in it, but the poet's inner feelings are conveyed through concrete images, so that readers get an irresistible impression of desolation. The famous sentences of the Wei and Jin Dynasties ("Spring grass grows in the pond.") and ("Spring grass is blue.") are also written very naturally. Later, Wang Zhou's ("Spring grass is green at will, without anyone.") and Bai Juyi's ("The green grass skirt waist is a diagonal.") can also convey the subtle lyric interest in short sentences. Later, in the lyrics of the Southern Song Dynasty, we often see lyrics dedicated to chanting spring grass, and most of them are long tunes. In terms of arrangement and antithesis, there is certainly no lack of excellent skills, but they are all inevitably in the style of "Xishe" carving. Therefore, whenever we read very long rambling lyrics, we feel that the chanting of objects is indeed very "skillful", but the overall impression left to the reader is not as good as some short sentences in the past. From this, we can see that arrangement and allusion are enough to damage the unity and completeness of art. Recently, I read Lu Jiye's "Ji Ruo Sui", the first "Banqiao Xing" is a six-character poem, and the sentences are; ("Spring goes and the grandson's dream is old, spring comes and the emperor's soul disappears, seventy-two families of fragrant grass, I don't know where the long bridge is.") It can also express a kind of dreamlike loneliness in spring.</p>
<p>In fact, there are really too many poems and lyrics chanting spring grass. As for Liu Chang's of the Song Dynasty ("Spring grass is continuous and cannot be named, hidden in the water and the origin of the stream, it seems to dislike the prosperous place of cars and horses, and it will not be born as soon as it enters the city gate.") and Wang Anshi's ("Fragrant grass knows who planted it, and there are several clumps along the steps. There is no intention to compete with the times, why is it green and lush?") are all works that are intended to express something other than spring grass. This is not writing about spring grass but writing about people. I personally like sentences that do not specifically chant spring grass but depict the spirit of spring grass. In March of late spring, the grass grows in Jiangnan, there are swallows, distant trees, sunsets with afterglow, and pedestrians drifting like dreams. Looking at that piece of blue, it really brings a kind of indescribable loneliness and joy. As long as a few lines of poetry slip from the mouth, it has drawn us into the pastoral spring dream of ancient poets.</p>
<p>However, this is too far from the present century. Our new poets should look at spring grass with new eyes and new emotions, and express it with new techniques.</p>
<h3>Literati Seem to Sign a Contract with Poverty</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ji Ping</p>
<p>Literati seem to sign a contract with poverty. If we open the books of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, we can find that nine out of ten literati are poor. The day before yesterday, I read Ishikawa Takuboku's "Two Bloodstains" (translated by Zhou Zuoren), and I was quite touched by the author's introduction at the back. Takuboku was a primary school teacher in Shibumin Village, Japan, with a monthly salary of eight yuan, and often felt the difficulty of life. The writings of literati are very related to his environment. In "Two Bloodstains", there is a very pitiful, very thin, and very poor child, Shintaro, who may be Takuboku's own microcosm, because he himself suffered from lung disease. His poverty was such that he could not plan for medical expenses, and he often ran out of food. Later, he published a collection of songs ("Sad Toys"), which sold for only 20 yuan, and he bought the tonic he wanted to eat on weekdays. I am afraid that the medicine could not cure his inner melancholy. Before he had finished eating the tonic, he passed away. He was only twenty-seven years old when he died. American novelist Hawthorne published his first book, but no one read it, and as a result, he was impoverished. He no longer wanted to make a living by writing, so he ran to the Salem Customs to work. Later, he lost his job again, and comforted by his wife, he stayed at home and wrote "The Scarlet Letter", and became famous in one fell swoop. Cervantes was also very poor, wearing ragged clothes and owing a lot of debt. Zhou Zuoren himself has an essay on Cervantes in "The Garden"; ("On November 8, 1590, Cervantes, in order to get forty yuan worth of cloth on credit, signed a contract with the cloth shop with his guarantor, and there were four notaries as mediators, which was as solemn as guaranteeing public bonds, as the legend says. When the government asked him to return the embezzled public funds in the winter of 1601, he also (had no means to feed himself), so he was imprisoned the following year. He was so poor, which is really possible. There is also a writer, I forgot his name, who was so poor that he sold everything, and later simply had no home to return to, so he wandered on the road at night. On the one hand, we feel sorry for this poor writer, but on the other hand, this matter is very interesting.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese poets are also poor, such as Li Bai's ("Five-flower horse, thousand-gold fur, call the boy to bring out fine wine, and spend myriads of sorrows with you.") is really rare. Therefore, it makes me think that poetry and prose become more ingenious when they are sad, perhaps there is some reason for it. Because of the stimulation of poverty, there must be a kind of abnormality in the nerves, so the poems and prose written are mostly profound. Or he wanted to borrow the comfort of the article, and his thoughts entered a mysterious and ethereal realm, and became a romantic school. Therefore, the poverty of literati is also a major factor in the success of his article.</p>
<p>Poverty is considered a very noble thing by Chinese literati. Tu Chishui of the Ming Dynasty was also very poor. His wife told him that there was no rice to cook tomorrow, but he said; ("Tomorrow's affairs, there will be tomorrow, and do not fail the moonlight of the parasol tree.") This is really helpless optimism, but the psychology of taking poverty as nobility can also be seen faintly.</p>
<h3>My Cousin</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>If you want to predict the future destiny of a nation's children, primary school teachers should be a worthy object of study.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I ran to the provincial capital for the first time from the countryside, I was still a child who felt strange about everything. My cousin hated me very much, saying ("Since you were born in the countryside, you should die in the countryside.") Later, seeing that I was not dull to a very terrible degree, he became kind to me and taught me everything.</p>
<p>("In the world, if you ignore a nail, you can't be said to be paying attention to it properly. Help me with some heavy housework. Whenever you have time, take out this box of books and read each one twice! A Xing (the name of his son) is useless. He would rather use his hands than his brains.")</p>
<p>At that time, he was working as an assistant teacher in a small school. Because sometimes he had to be in arrears with his salary, or issue discounted banknotes, he never received the full amount of 22 yuan. Every time he came back from receiving money, he stamped his feet and angrily scolded the education industry and all the people who were active in it, vowing to change his career, saying that even going to be a useless clerk or recorder.</p>
<p>He was very timid and had no friends, and even the hobby of drinking tea that any Cantonese had never contracted. He got up early, according to the norms set by hygienists for all healthy and wealthy people to abide by; he also followed the instructions of that norm and went to bed at a certain appropriate time. In winter, he ate an extra bowl of cured meat rice prepared by his cousin in the morning. Except for the days when he was paid, he didn't even smoke raw cigarettes, and he didn't talk much. He lived like a mouse, cautious, quiet, and regular.</p>
<p>Even he himself admitted that the only shortcoming, which he did not make up his mind to correct, was that he liked to play small mahjong. Coincidentally, a few pale-faced humble colleagues came, and they gambled together and told all kinds of old jokes. Unlike enthusiastic young people, he was not an addicted and generous gambler. But when he played cards, he was very serious; bending over, paying attention to every small colorful card with his sick eyes, his forehead and nose were covered with sweat; sometimes he argued for half an hour to criticize a card's mistake.</p>
<p>When his father was seriously ill, because he talked to the son of his deceased brother about the separation of the family, he quarreled and beat each other fiercely. Afterwards, he shivered all over, his eyes flashing with melancholy light, and he murmured to himself; What a fool! Have I ever done anything to be sorry for anyone? What crime have I committed? What happened to this world? Even if I meet Yama, I can't find any other flaws except saying that I like to play cards······"</p>
<p>He lived in a prison room cast in purple copper. Accompanied by small indignation and curses, he used all words to explain his actions, but refused to release himself; cut off various risky thoughts, and rejected the thoughts and theories that could make human progress. Seeing the drastic changes in society, he smiled, as if watching the gradual decline of his neighbor's family fortune, and said his ridiculous conclusion;</p>
<p>(As long as people's hearts are not dead, everything will return to its original state.)</p>
<p>What is lacking here is; I don't know how he taught those pure and innocent children when he was in class.</p>
<h3>The Human World (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>At this time, I was watching the figure of my old friend in the dark, while waiting for his reply, waiting for him to answer how much more I had to walk, or where he would lead me. But he did not answer me, but went deeper into a dark alley. There was not a single light on the road, as if it was isolated from the city. The alley was about three feet wide. As for how the ground was, whether it was wet or dry, my myopic eyes could not distinguish it at all. Therefore, due to the unsteady steps, I added different sounds to the dark alley. However, it was strange, my old friend walked so skillfully, which made me determine that he was not intentionally deceiving me. But since he did not answer me for a long time, I could not help but ask again;</p>
<p>(Friend, why can't we get there no matter how much we walk, what's going on? Moreover, we always walk on dark roads, where are you going to lead me?)</p>
<p>(Okay, don't be verbose. We're here).</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he stopped and knocked eight times in a row on a small door nailed with slats in a regular manner. I also stopped and waited.</p>
<p>(This is a secret agency)!</p>
<p>As soon as I thought about it, I immediately thought of the terrible dark cave in detective novels. However, no matter what, I was sure that my friend would not harm me, which made me feel relieved and emboldened. Waiting, waiting for a while to appreciate the scenery inside.</p>
<p>This alley is simply like hell. Although I have never been to hell, from the general discussion, it seems that no one denies that hell is dark. But, where can this go? Let me think about it; we started from 15th Street, walked on Zhengyang Street, and turned into 2nd Street, then this should be a small alley near 2nd Street. It's too secluded. Standing in the dark alley, you really can't think that outside is the prosperous Harbin City.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, there was no movement. My friend knocked eight times again. Yes, it was absolutely true that he knocked eight times again, no more, no less.</p>
<p>A slight sound of footsteps came from a distance and stopped in front of the slat door. A little girl of thirteen or fourteen years old opened the door. After we stepped over the threshold, the slat door was closed immediately. The courtyard was also a piece of black like the alley. The house was also black. After turning a corner, I followed my friend into a dark room.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the Journey to Guizhou (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Passing Lou Mountain Pass</p>
<p>In the morning when the sun has not come out, in this mountain valley, it is always gloomy, shrouded in smoke and fog all over the sky.</p>
<p>The mountains cannot be seen to the end, layer upon layer, with thick clouds rising from the mountainside, like cotton, floating in the sea and sky. If the inn where you live is close to the top of the mountain covered with clouds, then you can smell a peculiar smell, which is said to be miasma.</p>
<p>Roosters seem to be particularly numerous in this village and town. One crows, and all around echo. There is no need to look at what time it is. The sky is about five o'clock. This, you have to hurry up and get up, and prepare to set off. The first step of getting up is to stand at the door of the inn and watch the sky all around, because in the hearts of travelers, they firmly remember this sentence;</p>
<p>丨丨It is not too late to stay overnight before dark, and look at the sky early when the rooster crows.</p>
<p>If the weather is not good, the muddy mountain roads washed by rain will have a great impact on travelers. But today, it's okay. Although the sky is heavy, that's normal. In the gloom, there seems to be no sign of rain. Well, today is considered lucky again.</p>
<p>It is exactly the end of summer. The sultry heat in the mountain valley during the day is a bit scary. When staying overnight, the coolies who are attacked by fatigue are naturally too lazy to sleep in the prison-like inn. Here, under the porch of the inn, it becomes a drawing of meat, lying full of people in a mess. The ochre-brown body is lined with the grayish-yellow soil, and the color is very moving.</p>
<p>(Get up, hurry up, the rooster has crowed three times!) The head coolie shouted, opening his broken and hoarse throat. This seems to have become a routine business, and the head coolie is familiar with this routine.</p>
<p>The coolies got up in a panic, rubbing their eyes that had not slept enough, and a wave of resentment welled up on their faces.</p>
<p>(Boss lady, here, this is two hundred coins, even for today's breakfast.) (Saying) while speaking, a large rough-patterned quilt was thrown in, and several copper coins worth fifty wen were placed on the counter.</p>
<p>The boss lady is smiling, and several crow's feet that have been weathered for a long time are moving at the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Really, this seems to have become a task. No matter which inn you stay in, there is always such a riot every morning.</p>
<p>Wash your face by the stone pool for feeding donkeys, some also wash their feet by the way, then casually gnaw two bowls of coarse rice, and start to move. The sedan chair, the sliding pole, (Note) the flower basket pole, are carried from the frame built by the roof beams to the front of the inn door. That is just an empty frame. The oilcloth (Note) of the shop and the cushion for sitting must be temporarily laid. However, although the things have been carried to the front of the door, people have quietly dispersed. What is the reason? To prepare strength.</p>
<p>(Preparing strength) is not doing morning exercises, nor is it practicing any boxing, but to lie on a bamboo bed inlaid with wooden planks, and use the long gun of the bamboo tube and a half-dark oil lamp to invigorate the strength.</p>
<p>This is not surprising. Cigarettes are sold so expensive. The goods that are despised in the metropolis, such as Big Knife brand and Red Peach brand, have to be sold for more than two hundred a box here. It goes without saying that the good ones may not be available. Datou, on the other hand, is a local specialty. A small pot made of purple-red pottery, filled with a pot, weighs three qian, and the color is very good, and the selling price is two hundred coins, which is fair enough.</p>

<p>The March Gold Bar Tender Market Presents an Uncertain State</p>
<p>Initially Rising Due to Extraordinary Foreign Exchange Tightness</p>
<p>Subsequently Returning Due to Buyers Emerging</p>
<p>Yesterday, the March gold bar market initially rose due to the plummet in exchange rates. Suddenly, Mobil Oil had a settlement, leading to extraordinary tightness in US exchange rates, stirring up a buying frenzy, and causing the long positions to aggressively increase their stakes, leading to a rapid rise. Unexpectedly, after the foreign exchange market tightened, it suddenly eased, and general buyers emerged after entering. Although the Central Bank frequently opened spot tenders, the market supply exceeded demand, finally breaking the 70-yuan mark, performing even worse than before the swap. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver rise and US silver remain flat, while forward silver prices fell, and foreign exchange rates plummeted considerably. London raw gold rose five pence. Off-market forward trading was slightly stable, rising to 71.2 yuan, because the swap was offered by the long positions at a premium of more than seven yuan. It then rose to over two yuan. The Central Bank announced its posted rates, with both British and US rates rising by 0.125, while the Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.008, and the standard gold bar price retreated to 994.5 yuan, slightly declining. After opening, general sentiment, in light of the decline in British and US exchange rates but the rise in British-French rates, saw this as a phenomenon of the US dollar being uniquely expensive and expected extraordinary tightness in the foreign exchange market. As expected, banks opened by grabbing US dollars, boosting confidence, and large clients had strong buying appetites. The long positions scrambled to increase their stakes, immediately causing prices to rise. Although there was fluctuation, the sudden settlement by Mobil Oil led to an even tighter foreign exchange market and a relatively brisk rise. Floating short positions were rapidly closed at high prices, but a surge in selling at high prices stirred up the supply, gradually causing a pullback. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still levied at 6%, calculated at one shilling five pence 7.1875, also lacking impact. Afterwards, the selling side became more enthusiastic and relatively weak. Although there was a decline, the Central Bank opened spot tenders at 965 yuan, and after the low price, large clients bought aggressively, making it easy to rebound. However, as exchange rates gradually hardened, the supply side continued to work hard, and those increasing their stakes, seeing the unfavorable situation, exited together. Despite some trying to maintain at the lower level, prices ultimately retreated within the 70-yuan mark. The afternoon close was the weakest, with the overall trend uncertain for half a day, turning from firm to weak. The buying side's psychology was difficult to sustain, leading to this outcome. Swap trading was already low, and the overall trend was the long positions offering a premium of around eight yuan. The market situation for the half-day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 970.8 yuan, an increase of 7.4 yuan from the previous close, because the swap was offered by the bulls at a premium of over seven yuan. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu Dingkang, Dafa, Yongchang, Dayuanchang, Yonglaijin, and Citibank grabbed spot US dollars at 75, and rose to 4.5 yuan. Dacheng, Yuanmao, and Yong sold, falling to 3.4 yuan. Zhengjin grabbed March US dollars at 0.0625. Dafa, Yongyuanchang, Yonghongxing, Yongyitianfeng, etc., entered up to 5.2 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Yongli, Yuanyi, Yicheng, and Fuyu sold in succession, retreating to 3.8 yuan. Hengyu, Dafa, Yongda, Decheng, Fuchang, Qianchang, Xiangsheng, Daqingyu, Hengtai, etc., were suspected of adding positions, and the short positions urgently covered. Mobil Oil made efforts to settle spot US dollars, leading to a tightening foreign exchange market, and prices rose to 6.5 yuan. Magali bought March US dollars at 33.9375. Dafa, Yongshunmao, Renfa, Yongfu, Yifeng, and Yongzhentai Yuanmaoyong sold at high prices, gradually retreating to around 4 yuan. At this time, there was a moment of calm. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, also lacking impact. Afterwards, Xiangfeng and Hengxing sold slightly, retreating to 3.2 yuan. Hengyu added positions, rising to 4.1 yuan. Fuxing Yongda, Dafa, Yongyuanyi came to sell, and it fell to 2.6 yuan. Zai Decheng and Hengyu bought, rising to 3 yuan increased. Fuchang and Dadecheng sold fiercely, retreating to 2.4 yuan. Hengyu, acting for Runchangyu, vigorously bought positions. The Central Bank opened 490 spot positions at a price of 965 yuan and rebounded. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Fuxingyong also took in, and rose to 4.2 yuan. The foreign exchange market gradually hardened, and Da Ying also settled February shillings at 875. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Changdasheng, and others sold positions one after another, and it fell to 70 yuan. Hengchangyong, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, and others took in positions at low prices. The Central Bank continued to open spot prices at 962.5 yuan, and rebounded to 1.6 yuan, but because the buying side reported shaking, it was still difficult to maintain. Shunmao, Fuyu, Dafa, Yong Fuxingyong, etc., sold again to 0.2 yuan. Hengyu Hengchangyong entered at low prices to 1.2 yuan. Fuxingyong and Dafa Yong repeatedly sold, and gradually downstream. By the afternoon close, it fell to 969.1 yuan. After the close, it initially rose slightly due to greater demand from the buying side, but Fuxingyong still sold, and finally fell again. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 976.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 969.1 yuan, with a fluctuation of 7.4 yuan. Compared with the previous close, it rose by 5.7 yuan. If the swap premium is added, the difference is 7 yuan, which is a drop of 1.3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was due to the Central Bank's standard price for gold bars being posted at 994.5 yuan, which, based on the closing price, was approximately 25 yuan lower than the spot price, compared to the previous day's slight difference of 10 yuan. The registration price for February was 962 yuan, and for March was 969 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 952 yuan. The price of red gold was 968.8 yuan, because the swap required the long positions to offer a premium of more than seven yuan, it was two yuan lower than the term tender. The spot market situation was stable, with Tianjin goods retreating to a premium of 4 yuan, also due to the swap relationship. The Tianjin gang sold 350 taels to Yingfenghong, with a premium of 3.5 yuan. Eastern goods were approximately a premium of 3 yuan. Besides, there was a lack of trading. Swap trading was low. Initially, the long positions offered a premium of around 7.5 yuan. Tongtaichang and Hanheng immediately came to offer a premium and rose. Hanheng worked hard to offer a premium. At this time, Yuanheng Hengyu and Dadecheng made some premium bids, competing between 7.7 and 7.8 yuan. After entering, there was a lack of short positions. Wanfeng took the market to offer a premium, and it rose to over 8 yuan. Dadecheng offered to Yuanyi, adding up to 8.4 yuan. Afterwards, spot firms came to maintain the market, so Wanfeng offered 119 positions to Zai Dadecheng, retreating to 8.3 yuan. Yingfenghong took the market to cut prices and offer a premium, immediately falling within 8 yuan. Dadecheng offered 70 positions to Yingfenghong at 7.9 yuan. At this time, there was a struggle at around 8 yuan for a very long time. Finally, because Yingfenghong Qianchangxiang and others made some premium bids, there was a lack of long positions, and it retreated to around 7.5 yuan. The Central Bank opened over 800 spot positions, including 490 positions from Runchangyu, at a price of 965 yuan. In addition, various spot firms also handled some, at prices ranging from 962 to 963 yuan. Market trading was relatively brisk, with most traders entering first and exiting later. Therefore, although the Central Bank opened positions, it was difficult to maintain the market. In summary, Dafa Yong, Tianfeng, Wanxing, Fuyu, Dingkang, Yuanchangyong, Fuxingchangda, and others were on the buying side. Yongli, Shunmao, Neixing, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Dingchang, Shenkang, Rencheng, Dadecheng, and others were on the selling side. Hengyu, Dafa Yong, Fuxingyong, Yuanyi, Shengshengda, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, etc., entered first and exited later. Yifeng, Yongzhentai, Hengchangyong, Yongli Yuanmaoyong exited first and entered later. The Dalian gang Wanxing made over 400 positions in total, hedging over 200 positions. Shunli made less than 200 in total, with a slight excess in hedging. The Guang gang Hengxing had limited trading. Shengshengda entered first and exited later, with a slight excess in hedging. The total turnover on the day was approximately 30,000.</p>
<p>For the February contracts, the buying side included Fuchang with over 2,000, Hengyu with over 800, Dingkang with over 700, Yifengyong with over 500, Futaiheng with less than 500, Yuantai with over 300, and Ruikang Changxiangfeng each with over 200, Qingfayong, Shenkang, and Da Yuan each with over 100.

<h3>The Exchange Market Remains Weak in Sterling and Tight in US Dollars</h3>
<p>Mobil Oil's Settlement on the Market Makes It Tight</p>
<p>Banks Sell Out, Suddenly Tightening</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London large contracts, both near and far terms, rose 0.0625. It was said that after the market closed, the United States bought at the posted price of 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged. Mendl's forward silver prices remained unchanged and contracted by 0.045. London raw gold rose 5 pence. The British pound fell by 0.125 against the US dollar, and the US dollar contracted by 0.0175 against the British pound. The British pound rose by 75 pounds against the French franc, and the US dollar contracted by 0.01 against the French franc, making the phenomenon of weak sterling and tight US dollars even more pronounced. The near-term selling price opened in the morning, with the British pound at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.1875 and the US dollar at 34.75 yuan, compared to the previous close, showing the British pound weakening by 0.0625 and the US dollar tightening by 0.125. The Central Bank announced its posted rates, with both British and US rates rising by 0.125, while the Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.008, with little impact. After opening, due to the drastic fall in British and US exchange rates, but the sharp rise in the British-French rate, it can be seen that the British pound has not fallen, but is actually due to the extraordinary expense of the US dollar. Therefore, banks grabbed US dollars and gradually became tight. It was learned that HSBC Bank's posted rate showed the British pound flat and the US dollar contracting by 0.125. Chinese merchants lacked selling interest, and the settlement by Mobil Oil of spot US dollars tightened the process further. After entering, banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, gradually loosening the market. The British pound's situation was originally loose, but in the end, Chinese merchants' psychology was weak and lacked maintenance, suddenly becoming hardened. By the afternoon close, the near-term selling price was the British pound at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.1875 and the US dollar at 34.875 yuan, compared to the previous close, showing the US dollar flat and the British pound hardened by 0.0625. Chinese merchants slightly hedged. Banks initially grabbed and then sold out. Mobil Oil settled a considerable amount of spot US dollars. The transaction prices for the half-day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The British pound's recent selling price opened in the morning at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.1871. Huabi sold to Zhengjin's March contracts at 4 pence 75. Shanghai Huabi sold March contracts at 75. Da Ying sold February contracts at 875. Huabi sold to Anda's January contracts at 5 pence 0.125. Da Ying sold to Anda's spot contracts at 1875. Mitsui sold March contracts at 8125. The afternoon closing selling price was January contracts at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.1875, February contracts at 4 pence 0.9375, March contracts at 8125, April contracts at 75, May contracts at 6875, and the buying price was a premium of 0.0625.</p>

<h3>A Silver Dollar Market That is Apparently Loose but Secretly Tight</h3>
<p>In recent days, the silver dollar market has appeared exceptionally weak on the surface. The city's dollar discount rate has also fallen step by step, and yesterday the market fell another 2%. Both morning and afternoon trading was at 0.18 yuan, and there is a possibility that it may break through the 0.1 yuan mark. In reality, the tightness of the silver supply is no less than in the past. The lunar New Year is approaching, old habits have not been broken, and the final closing of accounts still exists, even more so than the solar New Year, causing social financial constraints to become even more extreme. Head-office overdrafts with foreign currency are more common, and the head-office allocation is insufficient, which has increased more than in the previous market. The initial rate was 0.03 yuan, then changed to 0.05 yuan. In terms of bill transactions, morning transactions totaled over 1.7 million, new transactions over 200,000, afternoon transactions over 500,000, small total clearing transactions over 900,000, foreign currency pledge redemption transactions over 800,000, and issuance over 900,000. Banknote transactions saw 800,000 yuan returned to the people and 900,000 yuan issued. There were also 700,000 yuan in unmarked bonds. Bank receipts and disbursements saw foreign banks receive and disburse over 1.7 million in bills, various merchandise and foreign exchange pledge miscellaneous receipts and disbursements over 3.6 million, foreign exchange settlements over 800,000, special remittances over 600,000, year-end settlements over 2.4 million, and 500,000 yuan in warehouse deposits. Chinese banks received and disbursed over 2.7 million in bills, various merchandise and foreign exchange miscellaneous receipts and disbursements over 4.5 million, telegraphic transfers over 600,000, foreign exchange settlements over 800,000, year-end settlements over 3.5 million, special remittances over 600,000, and 300,000 yuan in warehouse withdrawals. Money shops' foreign public bills received and disbursed over 34.4 million, foreign overdraft receipts and disbursements over 4.7 million, various remittances over 500,000, cash receipts over 600,000, customer sources over 200,000, and expenses over 350,000. In addition, the total amount exchanged at the city's bill exchange on the 16th was 10,085,273.94 silver dollars, including 5,904,876.8 silver dollars and 4,987,847.14 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Small Dollars Fall First, Then Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small dollars fell by 4 yuan in the morning, to 842 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly tightened, rising sharply by 5 yuan, to 847 yuan. The final check showed an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Morning transactions totaled 2,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions totaled 4,000 jiao. The situation of Guangdong small dollars was very stable, with the difference between the morning and afternoon markets only 0.05 yuan. The morning market was at 756.5 yuan, and the afternoon market was at 756 yuan, resulting in a slight decrease of 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. Morning transactions totaled 120,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions totaled 65,000 jiao. Copper coins were at 309,000 wen, the same as the previous day, with a transaction volume of 38,625 strings of coins, equivalent to 12,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities, Bond Market Lacks Strength to Rise</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Reduced... Market Sentiment Depressed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained lifeless. The lack of confidence and the depressed market sentiment had not diminished slightly. Foreign currency overdrafts eased to 0.18 yuan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had gone from Hangzhou to Shanghai and from Shanghai to Beijing, and the work of unity and suppression of bandits was still actively underway. Under normal circumstances, the market price prospects should have greatly improved. However, even after a long period of sideways stagnation, there was still no sign of an upward trend. The most fundamental reason was believed to be the recent government's proposal to levy a transaction tax on the exchange, which greatly reduced transaction volume. Both long and short positions hesitated to move forward. With fewer transactions, market prices naturally tended to be fixed. Currently, the issue of transaction tax is still being contested, but the deadline is approaching, and it should be announced soon. The market price will inevitably continue to fluctuate temporarily. Yesterday, the morning opening and closing sessions both showed slight increases of about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, as if there was a sign of recovery. However, among them, the 48th house was more enthusiastic, while the 20th house sold out vigorously, so the afternoon situation did not have the ability to continue to rise. Both the opening and closing sessions turned weak, probably due to the 11th house selling more. The overall trend was that although the rebound occurred, it was only fleeting. In summary, the market price results were mostly slightly better, ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. Two or three types were still slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The total turnover was 8,500,070 yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (units in yuan, transaction units in hundreds of yuan):</p>

<h3>The US Dollar Rises Sharply, and the New York Stock Market Falls Across the Board</h3>
<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market fell sharply due to widespread anxiety and fear caused by the imminent Supreme Court ruling on the gold coin clause case. It only slightly rebounded higher in the last half hour. Trading was especially smooth, and the telegraph was three minutes behind the market. Gold and silver mining stocks fell the most severely, and wheat and other commodities all created new lows for the quarter. The most significant event of the day was the sharp rise of the US dollar against foreign exchange. News from Europe stated that if the Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the gold coin clause were seriously considered, the United States would restore the former US dollar and therefore purchase US dollars. The currencies of the countries in the New York Gold Group fell by 17 to 101, and most have fallen below the shipping point, so the United States can now import gold. In Paris, the US dollar created the highest record since 1933. In London, the British pound fell sharply below the former parity, and the Dutch currency also fell sharply. The rebound at the end of the stock market was a natural reaction after the sharp fall. The bond market was weak, except for US government bonds, and Dutch bonds fell particularly sharply. Royal Dutch Shell's 4% bonds due in 1945 fell by 16 yuan the day before due to the ruling by the Hague Court, and continued to fall by 13.5 yuan yesterday. Small exchange stocks also fell, especially mining stocks. The full-day turnover was 1.37 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>14th　15th　Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　102.76　100.49　Down 2.27</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　35.44　34.17　Down 1.30</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　17.44　17.11　Down 0.33</p>
<p>40 Bonds　96.39　96.09　Down 0.30</p>
<p>11 Commodities　60.06　58.53　Down 1.53</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Spot Yarn Only Settled Trades</h3>
<p>The yarn market was unremarkable, with no progress. As the final account settlement deadline approached, all parties were preparing to close their positions, so new trades were scarce. Most people were pessimistic, due to the poor environment and financial dryness. However, many parties, in light of the difficulties faced by yarn factories and the frequent closures, did not release the advances that had been pulled. It is difficult to predict the future situation.</p>
<p>Jinji opened quite a few empty positions</p>
<p>When the spot yarn market opened in the morning, although American cotton fell by more than 10 pounds and Indian cotton rose again, the market sentiment remained flat, and buyers were cold and not numerous. The market was desolate. All the trades were mostly settling transactions. As a result, each month fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The afternoon market situation still did not show prosperity or decline. Quite a few empty positions were opened, and market prices did not fluctuate much. However, the major long and short positions all lay low. We must wait until after the abolition of the lunar New Year before we can determine who is dominant. Recent months rose and fell by 0.1 yuan, reaching a balance. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,250 bales, Tongxing 350 bales, Xinchang 200 bales, Shenchang 200 bales, and Dafeng 200 bales. Dafu bought 400 bales, Yuanyi 500 bales, Jinchang 250 bales, Dafeng 250 bales, and Zhenda 200 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Increase/Decrease　Account Balance</p>
<p>January Contract　183.9　185.6　183.6　Down 0.20　28,700</p>
<p>February Contract　184.7　184.4　184.7　Up 0.20　42,500</p>
<p>March Contract　186.3　186.1　186.3　Down 0.30　53,350</p>
<p>April Contract　187.5　187.0　187.4　Down 0.30　52,000</p>
<p>May Contract　188.6　188.5　188.6　Down 0.10　28,400</p>
<p>June Contract　189.0　188.9　189.0　Down 0.10　5,800</p>
<p>Total　210,750</p>
<p>Spot Yarn sold 700+ Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. It was found that the total purchases from various gangs for the whole day amounted to 776 bales. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong　410　Jiangxi　30　Changsha　175　Haizhou　40</p>
<p>Inland　100　Zhenjiang　10　Same Trade　Ningbo　10</p>
<h3>Spot Month Cotton Buying to Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>The spot month cotton market has been quite firm recently because the delivery period is approaching. The supply of cotton that has passed inspection by the cotton inspection office is not yet fully sufficient. It is also unknown whether it will increase later. It is noted that more than 95,000 bales remain to be delivered for transactions this month. Therefore, those with short positions without actual goods are actively covering their positions. Some are still selling in the distant months. In the afternoon, there were rumors that Indian cotton futures in the unofficial market had fallen by two rupees.</p>
<p>Distant Month Cotton Still Being Sold</p>
<p>Before the opening of the bidding, Indian cotton continued to rise, while American cotton fell. Selling pressure was slightly strong, and the three major long positions of Tongxing, Changfeng, and Changhe closed out a significant amount of their positions. Therefore, the market situation appeared quite weak, and sentiment was dampened. However, the spot month market was tight due to delivery issues, while the distant month market fell by five points. In the afternoon opening, it was heard that gold prices closed lower and were weak. However, those who profited covered their positions in the third session, and because those who had open positions covered their shorts this month, the market turned firm. Prices for all months rose by five points to one dime. It is noted that the following were sold: Tongxing 4,000 bales, Gengfeng 900 bales, Changfeng 3,500 bales, Runkang 1,200 bales, Yikang 1,000 bales, Yuanxingchang 3,200 bales, Changhe 3,200 bales. The following were bought: Yuanda 1,100 bales, Dafu 1,500 bales, Zhenda 1,700 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Yuande 2,100 bales, Yongchang 800 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures  Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase Decrease Open Interest</p>
<p>January 36.50 36.40 36.50 Increase 0.05 95,300</p>

<p>British Mills Begin Procuring Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is still maintainable, and British mills have also initiated purchases. The sources include 2,150 bales of Yao flower and 60 bales of Tong flower.</p>

<h3>Uncertain Gold Bar Proposal, Large-Scale Closing of American Cotton Long Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher due to favorable overseas market conditions and strong demand from peers. Afterwards, due to the uncertainty surrounding the gold bar proposal, a large number of long positions were closed, and the market gradually declined. At the same time, the gold yuan sharply rose, and grains and the stock market were weak, which also contributed to the unfavorable market situation. However, peers showed strong buying interest when prices fell. Near the close, the market was slightly better due to silver coins. The spot market was quiet. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 9 to 15 points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices up 6 points and futures up 2 points. Indian cotton speculators bought, Japanese merchants sold, and there was some arbitrage. Pingguo'er rose by 2.5 cents, Aomula rose by 1 rupee, and Bairofexi rose by 2.75 rupees.

<h3>Japanese Yarn Aggressively Invades China: Price Comparison Table</h3>
<p>In recent years, high cotton prices and low yarn prices have caused significant distress to mills. It is often heard that some businesses are unable to sustain operations. It is rumored in the market that some mills are considering early shutdowns and delayed restarts during the lunar new year period, indicating the seriousness of the situation for Chinese mills. The yarn market should have an active upward trend, but unfortunately, due to financial constraints and the low prices of Japanese yarn, the North China market has already been seized by Japanese yarn. It is noted that the market price for 42-count Japanese Shuiyue yarn is 32 yuan lower than Chinese Jincheng yarn. Although the goods have slight differences, the price difference is alarming. The prices of other 32-count, 16-count, and 20-count yarns are all more than ten yuan or five, six, seven, or eight yuan lower than Chinese yarns. The quotations of Japanese yarn currently traded in the market are listed below for reference.</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour Futures Rebound, Results Average</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of first falling, then rising, and then leveling off. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were down about 9.10 to 1.30 yuan in Chicago and 0.20 to 0.60 yuan in Canada. When the prices opened, the weakness of market sentiment due to the sharp fall in foreign wheat was expected. Therefore, the opening prices for all months fell by 0.12 yuan. However, the magnitude of the decline in foreign wheat was not significant, which was then influenced by rumors that there would be additional taxes on foreign wheat and that some mills would have to reduce production. Therefore, in the second session, the market reversed and showed an upward trend. The closing prices for the near months were similar to the previous day, while the distant months rose by an additional 0.01 yuan, indicating significant fluctuations. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the trend had eased, and transactions had decreased. It is estimated that 400,000 to 500,000 bags were traded in the morning, and about 200,000 bags were traded in the afternoon. The output of the mills was about 200,000 to 300,000 bags, and the good-to-flat trend in the afternoon was due to the large output of the mills. Considering the subsequent trend, the price of foreign wheat may still be flat or weak. In the end, prices for January and February remained unchanged, March was up 0.075 yuan, April was up 0.005 yuan, May was unchanged, and June was up 0.075 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Spot Month Lower, Distant Months Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices for all months were first flat and then stable. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were down 0.90 to 1.23 yuan in Chicago and 0.20 to 0.60 yuan in Canada. Transactions were active in the spot month at the opening, and the opening prices were down by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. The prices for the distant months were initially flat, but then the market sentiment improved due to the rebound in the flour market and rumors of additional taxes on foreign wheat, and the prices were up by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the trend for the spot month was flat, with little fluctuation. The prices for the distant months were slightly better due to the decrease in selling. However, the rumors were not fully believed, so buying was not very active. In the end, the price for the spot month fell by 0.03 yuan, February was up 0.05 yuan, March was up 0.02 yuan, and April was up 0.05 yuan. The spot wheat market also declined, down 0.08 to 0.10 yuan from the beginning of the week. Dongguide Suzhou wheat was quoted at 3.91 yuan, second grade at 3.90 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.89 yuan, and Henan wheat at 3.84 yuan. A total of 8,000 bags were reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>The weakness of Chicago wheat prices today is due to the failure of Winnipeg prices to hold up. This will be reflected again in the local market, but it is not expected to be as heavy as today's selling.</p>

<p>River Rice Surges, Continues to Fall by 0.10 to 0.20 Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, because the sources from various provinces were quiet, more than 60 boats (totaling over 10,000 shi) were blocked, market sentiment was increasingly discouraged, and sales were stagnant. Although the Weihaiwei province brokers continued to sell 700 to 800 bags, the surge in goods ultimately made supply exceed demand, the situation continued to weaken, and the market continued to decline. Prices repeatedly fell, such as various late rice varieties down 0.10 to 0.15 yuan, and various thick japonica varieties down 0.20 yuan. Duyangjian also fell by about 0.10 yuan, and Yinbianyuan and currency softening were also observed by about 0.10 yuan. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 20 to 30 boats of goods arrived from the river region. Sales of various types of rice in the market were slow. White japonica, Yangdu, Bukejian, Daixian, Bianyuan were slightly better in price. Thin rice and early rice were flat. White japonica prices were slightly down 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Yangdu, Jianbianyuan, thin rice, and early rice were down by nearly 0.10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Rebounds by 0.10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Two New Ships Arrive with Confirmed Orders</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market opened higher in the morning due to the news of soaring prices in Saigon and Siam the previous night. Market sentiment was boosted, hoarders were determined not to sell, and new hoarders took the opportunity to buy. The appetite in the inland areas of this street was particularly strong. Inland buyers purchased 4,600 bags of Siamese broken rice, and local buyers purchased 3,000 bags of Saigon rice. Prices gradually rose by about 0.10 yuan. The return of futures rice decreased, with only 100 tons opened for each of March, April, and May. Foreign firms sold 1,000 tons for January and February, and prices rebounded by 0.10 yuan and several points. The market situation was excellent yesterday, and local buyers were very eager. The market may need to be rebuilt. However, confirmed orders are gradually arriving in Shanghai. Two new ships arrived yesterday and are docked at Yitaixing Wharf for unloading. The total is about 100,000 bags. It is estimated that another one or two ships will arrive in the next few days. Confirmed orders for December and January may need to arrive before the Lunar New Year. The customer xian rice market had been flat and weak, but yesterday, it was boosted by imported rice by 0.02 yuan. Local and inland buyers purchased 3,500 bags. Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse Raw Sugar White Offered by Tender</p>
<p>Price: 18.70 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained flat and weak. The guild's classified two-four coarse raw sugar white, ordinary spot goods, was priced at 18.85 yuan, down another 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The first batch of 800 yuan of Guangdong sugarcane-made coarse raw sugar white that arrived previously was sold yesterday by the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company through tender, with a price of 18.70 yuan, which was 0.15 yuan lower than the price of Dutch goods. The current price of Dutch red sugar Nos. 8 and 9 was 13.90 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 19.25 yuan, also down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The market for locally produced cotton white was stable, with No. 1 at 18.30 yuan, No. 2 at 18.10 yuan, No. 3 at 17.95 yuan, and No. 4 at 17.85 yuan. The price of Chaoqing sugar was heard to be turning flat at the place of production, while the local market was slightly quiet, and firms were watching cautiously with little progress. The quoted prices remained the same, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>
<p>Metals: Strapped Iron Users Panic</p>
<p>In addition to the original box of prime number (ie single and double linked) and deputy number (ie company iron) tinplate, there is another kind of strapped iron, so its price is cheaper than the original box. Users are more than happy to trade because of its low price. In recent years, due to the large iron boxes made by the cigarette company, most of them are used here, so its sales have been advancing rapidly. However, this year, after the exchange rate of the shilling and the US dollar has tended to rise, overseas prices have been rising. Fellow traders have made the difference that the cost is very small compared with the genuine goods, so most of them have abandoned the strapped iron and ordered the genuine goods. The source is getting less and less day by day. In recent days, its circulating goods have even been cut off, so users have been panicking. The standard opening price for each bundle has risen to 25 yuan (calculated as 200 pounds), which is about 1 yuan better than before. I heard that the price of No. 2 goods is 29.5 yuan (200 pounds of American company iron), and the price of No. 1 goods is 33 yuan (90 pounds of double-linked American tinplate). Because of this, users have to switch to using No. 2 goods. It is heard that there will be one or two new batches of goods arriving this month, so users are trying to throw them in. It is heard that more than 40 tons have been opened, and the price is estimated to be 26.25 yuan per bundle, which is 0.75 yuan higher than before.</p>

<h3>Students Studying in Japan and Expelled Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, the number of Chinese students studying in Japan has gradually increased. It is said that the reason is that in addition to the decrease in the Sino-Japanese exchange rate, the relationship between China and Japan has gradually become harmonious to some extent. This has to be said to be a very good phenomenon. Because the relationship between China and Japan has gradually become harmonious, the future of Sino-Japanese friendship can be optimistic. On the other hand, Chinese students who aspire to make progress can also take this opportunity to study in the East with peace of mind.</p>
<p>However, things in the world are always so comical. Recently, newspapers have been publishing news about the increasing number of Chinese students studying in Japan on the one hand, and news about Chinese overseas Chinese who have been expelled from Japan and have arrived in Shanghai on the other hand. Moreover, as of today (the 14th), there have been as many as 26 batches of Chinese overseas Chinese who have been expelled from Japan and returned to China. It is also heard that those who will return in succession after the 26th batch will be the 27th batch, the 28th batch, and so on.</p>
<p>I am putting these two things here丨students studying in Japan and refugees returning to China丨together for comparison, not to say that the reason why overseas Chinese in Japan are being expelled is because of the increase in the number of students studying in Japan; or that the reason why the number of students studying in Japan is increasing is the result of the expulsion of overseas Chinese in Japan. What I don't understand is; since the relationship between China and Japan has gradually become harmonious, it is natural for the number of students studying in Japan to increase; but why are overseas Chinese in Japan being expelled back to China? Is it that the harmony between China and Japan can only benefit students studying abroad, while overseas Chinese have to suffer instead? If there were no fact that the number of students studying in Japan is gradually increasing as proof, just looking at the expulsion of overseas Chinese in Japan back to China, we would not only not dare to believe that the relationship between China and Japan has become harmonious, but even suspect that the relationship between China and Japan is becoming increasingly broken.</p>
<p>However, there is no fact without a reason in the world. After trying hard to find the reason for these two things, I finally suddenly realized. It turns out that so-called students studying abroad and so-called overseas Chinese, although they are both Chinese, they are two different kinds of people. What is the difference between them? It is here; students studying abroad are consumers who bring many, many shiny silver dollars from their motherland to spend in Japan; overseas Chinese are producers who sometimes inevitably remit some Japanese currency back to their motherland to settle down. The former kind of people are beneficial to the Japanese, while the latter kind of people are harmful to the Japanese.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Japanese welcome our students studying abroad and expel our overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Open Pawnshops and Pawn Young Girls</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>According to a recent report from Tianjin, many pawnshops opened by Japanese ronin in Tangshan are exploiting people with high interest rates. On the 13th, a refugee couple from Yutian, carrying a daughter, only twenty years old, with a very beautiful appearance, had no travel expenses to leave the customs. They were seen by the owner of a Japanese pawnshop who induced them to pawn the girl for one month for 20 yuan, with a monthly interest of 2 yuan. There was a contract stating that when redeeming the girl, they must also repay the expenses for food and drink, etc. This piece of news is a unique innovation in the pawnshop industry. It can be seen that the Japanese's exploitation with high interest rates and whimsical ideas are truly meticulous. Although this matter is very small,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>the impact of its occurrence is very significant. I wonder, if the parents of a male lacked travel expenses, would he also be pawned? If only females are pawned and not males, what is the reason for this? If an old woman lacks travel expenses, would she also be pawned? If only young girls are pawned and not old women, what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Just speaking of young girls, I have several feelings: (1) The pawnshop publicly accepts young girls as pledges, treating young girls as the same as goods, and their psychology of despising Chinese people can be expressed. (2) Charging 2 yuan in interest for one month, if pawned for one year, it must be 24 yuan, which means the interest rate is higher than the principal. (3) Even in one month, the interest is already 2 yuan. If food and drink expenses are added, and the price is not specified, it can be extorted at will. Even if the asking price is not too high, the cost of food and drink for one month must be 4 or 5 yuan, so how can the pawner have the ability to redeem the girl? (4) The pawnee is also a mature and beautiful woman. If the shop owner is unscrupulous and violates her chastity, how should this account be settled?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that this kind of fact is nominally accepting young girls as pledges, but in reality, it is selling young girls, because, on the one hand, with such a high interest rate, the pawner will definitely not be able to redeem the girl, and on the other hand, a young and beautiful woman entering the shop has no absolute guarantee. However, taking a further step to explore the essence of this matter, it lies in the fact that our country's wealthy compatriots do not show compassion for their fellow countrymen in difficulty and do not try to find ways to help them. Therefore, they have no choice but to be manipulated by Japanese ronin. The blame does not lie with the Japanese, so why blame the Japanese?</p>
<h3>Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The pale light of the gas lamp flickered at the corner of the alley. Raindrops, under that white light, scattered down like broken glass. It was already about eleven o'clock. There was still the sound of a car horn or two on the road, but that sound was very muffled, almost inaudible in this quiet, deep alley. At this time, Li Ada was still lying alone in a corner under that pale light, panting weakly. Gusts of wind mixed with raindrops hit his body, and his teeth chattered, his body constantly trembling. Although he wanted to get up and move around, his limbs, which had no strength, could not be lifted no matter how hard he struggled. It seemed that something weighing a thousand catties was pressing down, making it impossible to move even a little.</p>
<p>Li Ada had been sick for the past few days. It was originally a very minor illness, but it seemed like a serious illness to him. His hungry stomach and cold body made his illness even more severe. He repeatedly wanted to take some medicine, but he could not find any money no matter how he tried. Yesterday, he was so hungry that he could no longer bear it. He tried his best to walk, but in the end, he only got two rotten buns from Lin Mazi, and he has been like this until now. Although he had been dizzy from hunger several times and his whole body was stiff from the cold, he could no longer get up.</p>
<p>At this time, his eyes blurred as he looked at the pale light of the gas lamp. His face, covered with a layer of black dust, looked even paler. His breathing gradually became weaker, and the faces of his mother and younger brother, who had starved to death during the great drought this year, appeared in his mind. His weak nerves suddenly felt a heat like fire, and he passed out unconsciously.</p>
<p>Li Ada was originally a farmer. He was known for his honesty in the village. Although he was only in his twenties this year, he had been hired to work as a farmhand since his father died when he was fourteen. For more than ten years in a row, he had never rested. But this year, there was a great drought everywhere. Although Li Ada was honest and reliable, no one hired him to work as a farmhand. His mother, who worked as a maid for others, was also fired. His fifteen-year-old younger brother also stopped doing small business. The three of them were living on loans every day. At first, the villagers lent them some money because they were all honest people, but gradually, they borrowed too much, and others had no way to help them. The three of them had no choice but to endure hunger. At this time, his younger brother became ill. This illness was entirely caused by hunger, but as a result, he died from the illness. His fifty-year-old mother fell ill and died less than ten days later, partly because his younger brother had died and partly because she could not bear the hunger. At this time, Li Ada could no longer live in this village, so he and Lin Mazi and a few others from the village went to the metropolis of Shanghai together. But after arriving here, none of the five or six of them could find a way to make a living, and they ended up wandering the streets all day, becoming a group of homeless wanderers.</p>
<p>(Hey, Ada, get up, I've been looking for you for a long time, but you're lying here.)</p>
<p>Li Ada vaguely heard someone calling him. He slowly and weakly opened his dull eyes. At this time, he realized that he had not died yet. Lin Mazi was sitting next to him, shivering.</p>
<p>(Are you hungry? Brother Liu San is coming soon. He went to find a way, let's wait for him to bring something for you to eat!)</p>
<p>Lin Mazi said with his teeth chattering, but in Li Ada's view, he was afraid that he would no longer have the good fortune to eat something brought by Liu San. He looked at Lin Mazi with a bitter face, moaning without saying a word.</p>
<p>Time was passing quickly. It was almost dawn. Although the rain had stopped, the northwest wind was even colder when it blew on people. At this time, Liu San and Liu Er, the two brothers, walked in from outside the alley, but when the two of them got closer, they only saw Lin Mazi staring blankly and shedding tears. The pale light of the gas lamp shone on his face, which was just white, with no blood at all. He saw the two of them coming and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>(We have lost another companion.)</p>
<p>When Liu San and Liu Er heard these words, they looked at Li Ada, who was lying in the corner and could no longer move, and stood silently.</p>
<h3>Foreign Land</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>About three or forty years ago, people thought that foreign lands were barren lands. However, as the number of overseas Chinese who made fortunes in Southeast Asia increased day by day, people envied foreign lands as if they were golden heavens.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I ate the "foreign cakes" brought back by returning overseas Chinese, and I saw them wearing black silk shirts and pants. How beautiful and lovely the foreign land was! These dream traces were deeply imprinted in my heart. But I didn't know that "foreign land" (鄉俗意指南洋) -- local customs refer to Southeast Asia -- was originally similar to a place inhabited by barbarians. All of them were Southern Chinese who went there at the risk of their lives, and gradually developed it. In the beginning, shipping was not yet very developed, and sea routes were not yet open. People from Guangdong and Fujian, with their adventurous and brave nature, boldly sailed on large wooden boats that were very easy to sink. The number of people who died midway, and those who died in foreign lands due to acclimatization and the difficulty of living in the barbarian land, is truly unknown. Even twenty years ago, when there were more people in my hometown who were considered to have gone abroad, it was still regarded as a terrible and unfamiliar place! The children of wealthy families were reluctant to let him go abroad. Most of them were prodigal sons who were not very tolerated in their hometowns, so they had to go abroad. Even in the most prosperous times of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, people who went abroad were still very hard.</p>
<p>Leaving their hometowns, abandoning their wives and children, and going abroad, in the eyes of Chinese people who have the deepest sense of belonging to their homeland, is the most desolate thing. Just take the closer Vietnam as an example. Finding nearly twenty yuan for travel expenses also requires more than ten yuan for the entrance fee, and it is even more necessary to prepare to pay the first year's head tax of more than thirty yuan. This large capital for going abroad is often borrowed with great difficulty; some even sell oxen, marry widowed sisters-in-law, or sell daughters, and want to go to foreign lands to make a living, leaving behind their families and relatives in their hometown, with their hearts full of sadness. When they arrive at the seaside, they see the endless green water rolling and rolling.</p>
<h3>Those Who Don't Recognize Treasure</h3>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>These are mostly new immigrants from the countryside, and their hearts are already sour with sadness.</p>
<p>Finally, the ship crossed the Seven Seas, and the seawater changed from green to black, and then from black back to green. If the voyage is smooth, they have already suffered a lot of hardship on the journey. The life in the hold for several days and nights is certainly not pleasant.</p>
<p>The ship safely enters the port and arrives at the shore of the foreign land. But they cannot disembark at will. They stand on the deck and wait, being fried by the tropical sunlight. They don't know how many hours they have to wait before they are allowed to climb onto the land of the foreign land. They cannot leave freely, but must continue to wait. Luggage is not allowed to be taken away immediately, but must be taken into the luggage inspection room to be inspected. Only after all the entry procedures have been completed can they go to the luggage inspection room to retrieve it. Whether the things they retrieve are missing or not, they can only accept their fate. After being kicked and beaten, they have to spend some money to get their things back properly. This is also considered a difficult hurdle.</p>
<p>After putting the luggage in the luggage inspection room, people must be driven into the new guest office like pigs. If their fate is good, the officials will handle their entry procedures on the same day. They must have a merchant guarantee before they can stay. After paying all the entry papers and head tax papers, they can be released from the new guest office. Like prisoners, they have to make several fingerprints. The officials sign the papers and receive a head tax paper. This paper must be carried with them at all times, otherwise, if they are caught, they will be arrested and imprisoned first before anything else is said. If they lose it, it is the same as not having paid it, and they have to pay it again, which is expensive and very troublesome. If the ship arrives at the shore when the officials are not working, they will be locked up in the new guest office overnight, with no food or place to sleep, which is even more bitter than being in prison. When handling the procedures peacefully, it is very common to be kicked and beaten unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Even if they safely leave the new guest office and temporarily find a place to live, whether they can find a job is also a troubling problem. There is no need to say more about the taste of unemployment. Even if they have a job, it is not easy to be a clerk in an overseas Chinese store. There is no limit to how many hours they work. Except for the time for sleeping and eating, they almost sell themselves entirely to the boss. It is difficult to find entertainment and happiness. They only love to worry about their hometown.</p>
<p>In an unfamiliar place, when they are sick, the store will definitely not allow sick clerks to receive their salary for nothing. They are dismissed and sent to every hospital to wait for death. If they want to go back, they cannot leave freely. They must report to the government forty days in advance and pay several dollars for the exit paper fee. Only after it is found that there is no other reason will they be allowed to leave. A foreign land is like a strange and ruthless prison!</p>
<h3>Personal Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Previously, the splendid ideals and gentle dreams cherished in my mind, once struck by cruel encounters, shattered instantly, like a glass full of red wine dashed against a rock. Now, I have no fanciful thoughts at all. My only hope now is that the pair of dreadful beasts of life, constantly pursuing me, can ease up a little, stop chasing so relentlessly, allowing me to calm my panicked emotions, my wildly beating heart, to rest my weary legs, and let me catch my breath for a moment. But is this possible? No, it's not. If my legs slow down even slightly, those beast-like aspects of life will pounce on me, nearly devouring me as a snack.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can only struggle with the last of my strength, panting, running forward, not even daring to look back.</p>
<p>Life is truly like a ferocious beast! It constantly instills in me all sorts of fears and threats, glaring at me with vicious eyes, waiting for me to slip up and finish me off. Because of this, I have to support my frail body day after day, from dawn till late at night, crouching in a musty and narrow little room, ruthlessly taxing my brain to its utmost, spreading out the manuscript paper, line after line transferring from my mind to the tip of my pen, and from the tip of my pen scratching onto the paper.</p>
<p>Ah, the one who consumes his own heart's blood; having set down his pen, he sighs in this way.</p>
<p>My mind is so weary that I must lie down, but I still have to force open my tired, watering eyelids and continue to smear words on the paper, one by one. Sometimes, even when sick, I still have to bear the pain of illness and work on the manuscript, unless my eyes see flowers and my head is dizzy. Whenever I finish a piece of writing and read it again from the beginning, my heart inevitably aches terribly, as if suddenly struck heavily by an iron hammer. Within it are countless traces of my own fresh red blood and mottled tears! Often, in the quiet of late at night, under the lamplight, I would take out many of my stored manuscripts, casually flipping through them, and sometimes I would recall a ridiculous state of mind from earlier days. At that time, I used to regard them as a place of spiritual respite, as the ultimate source of my soul's refuge, even as the only companion on the lonely journey of life. I treasured them in my luggage, like a cherished object, accompanying me through many places, for a long time, almost unwilling to part with them. In lonely inns, unable to dispel the long nights, I would often open my luggage and take them out, happily admiring them, feeling that these were the crystallizations of my soul's flowers, possessing infinite glory. And so, a wonderful feeling of solace would slowly fill my entire heart, almost intoxicating me with this spiritual comfort. But this ridiculous state of mind had long since vanished along with my dreams and ideals.</p>
<p>How is it now? When I look at them, my hands tremble, my heart aches, and I am filled with anger, seeing them as the greatest enemies of my life, no longer a spiritual refuge, a companion in life. Within them, so many of my bloodstains, so many of my tearstains, have been rendered. They are like a poisonous worm, invisibly gnawing away at my youth, devouring my life. What emotions are left? I only have pain, hatred, loathing. When my hatred reaches its extreme, I almost want to light a fire and burn them all to ashes, so they will never appear before my eyes again, because as soon as I see them, I will inevitably and naturally recall the past, feeling that things have changed too quickly, and I will feel infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>The glory that exists for people like me, especially when I see others' fervent praise for me, or the comfort and joy of seeing my own work, does not exist for me in the slightest. I only know that with each session of writing on paper, a little more of my heart's blood is poured out, and at the same time, my life takes another step closer to the edge of the grave. Therefore, I have no hope at all that when my eyes are closed and my breathing stops, someone will come to my tomb, reciting my poems while proclaiming my deeds during my lifetime. I only hope to be able to part with those things forever, or perhaps live a little longer, but this unknown tragedy will not end until the very last day.</p>

<p>Nine sons born of one mother, and also a daughter with red makeup. Returning to the court with much glory, the gatekeeper rushes to report to the inner hall. The madam, hearing the news, hurries out to greet him, welcoming the husband to the inner hall. Madam, I was made emperor abroad for thirteen years, hoping that you have been safe and well. I don't know which of the nine sons is the best; I hope you will tell me about their deeds one by one. Husband, the eldest son is a first-rank official serving as prime minister; the second son is a successful candidate seated in the main hall. The third son is enfeoffed as a earl in Yunnan; the fourth son is the Minister of War. The fifth son is the governor of Shandong; the sixth son teaches the crown prince literature in the East Palace. The Left Deputy Censor-in-Chief is the seventh son; the Minister of Personnel is the eighth son. Although the ninth son is young, he was the top scorer in the imperial examination last year. The one daughter is sixteen years old; the emperor selected her to be a consort. The nine daughters-in-law are all virtuous; eight granddaughters accompany her in the embroidery room. The twelve grandsons are skilled in both literature and martial arts; each studies literature in the study, and can also engage in duels with swords and spears in their free time. Twenty years ago, I received a sign: gauze hats and red robes filled the hall, moreover, a golden dragon hung in the center. Now, the nine sons recite grandsons, possessing wealth and honor; each of the nine beauties has much glory. Descendants fill the hall, and children and grandchildren flourish.</p>

Heart ash, intention sinking, truly an unfortunate family, as it has been said since ancient times. That day, braving the rain, came to Kun Bi Ling Station, how could the wind and thunder meet, unable to proceed. Jia Zheng unintentionally peered out of the window, at leisure. Suddenly, he saw a poor monk walking along the riverbank. He was bald, barefoot, in tattered clothes, standing against the wind, unable to bear the cold. His face seemed familiar, but he could not recall it in his heart. From afar, he repeatedly bowed towards the boat, clasping his hands, bowing and greeting. Suddenly, he remembered that the missing Baoyu was him. Why shave your head and enter the emptiness? (Crying) Son, the old ancestor's love was not false, leaving without saying goodbye is too unbearable. Nineteen years of nurturing cannot be repaid, thinking of such an ending, is it not even more heartbreaking? As a father, I will go home today, come and travel together in the same boat. Baoyu is silent, without a sound, like joy, like sorrow, sighing, tears streaming, without words answering the elderly. Suddenly, two monks and Daoists came to drag Yu away, in an instant, the person and shadow disappeared.

<h3>Claudette Colbert's Correspondence with a Unique Fan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Is it possible? Can a star and a fan develop a special relationship? Most people who enjoy watching movies like to correspond with their favorite movie stars. But what about the stars themselves? Do they pick out one or two special people from among the thousands of fans and develop special feelings for them? Do they pick out a few special and different letters from among the thousands of fan letters, which occupy a special and superior place in the hearts of the stars?</p>
<p>According to ordinary facts, it is almost impossible. No matter how touching your letter is, it is just one among thousands. Some are special and different from ordinary fan letters, but the number of letters received every day is so large, and the stars have never met you, so how can they develop special feelings for you? However, Claudette Colbert is an exception to the rule. She has a sincerely beloved fan.</p>
<p>Once, she was talking to a newspaper reporter. At first, she seemed eager to tell him about it. But then she shook her head frequently. How could she be embarrassed to say it? She suddenly gave people a surprise. She suddenly looked up and laughed loudly. After a while, she quickly apologized, saying, "Please forgive me. Every time I think about how this thing started, I can't help but laugh. At the beginning, I didn't find it interesting. I felt very angry, but now... I can't help but laugh when I think about it."</p>
<p>"What's his name?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>Claudette stared at the reporter, unable to answer for a moment. She suddenly pursed her lips, revealing a mischievous smile. Then she suddenly jumped up and ran out of the reception room. After a while, she came back with a large package of letters. She smiled and sat down, untied the green gauze ribbon around the letters, and then said, "I know that person very well. Even if I announced his name, he wouldn't necessarily blame me. She said, taking out the first letter, "You can see for yourself."</p>
<p>The reporter read the letter. The name signed was Daniel Kirk, a man's name. Inside, the fan sent Claudette Colbert a movie script. Of course, Claudette didn't have time to read scripts sent by strangers. She set this rule, instructing her secretary that if someone sent a script from outside, there was no need to notify her, just write a thank-you note and return it. This time, her secretary broke the rule and took the fan's letter and the movie script he wrote to her to read. Claudette had worked hard all day that day and was in a bad mood. Hearing her words, she immediately jumped up and scolded her secretary, saying that she didn't understand the rules. But her secretary said that the script was particularly good. This made Claudette even angrier. She threw the script on the ground and drove her secretary out.</p>
<p>After her secretary left, she unintentionally picked up the script and flipped through it. On the last page, she found a line of small print, which read, "I don't know if Miss Colbert will read this, who knows?" Claudette went to her desk and wrote him a letter herself. There were no other words on it, only the three words "Who knows?" After she finished writing, she attached the letter to the script and returned it to Mr. Kirk. She thought that everything was over this time.</p>
<p>But after a few days, she received another letter from the fan, which only contained three similar words, "God knows."</p>
<p>Claudette found these three words very interesting and very simple. She then wrote another reply in passing, which read, "Does God really exist?" A few days later, she received another reply, which contained only one word, "Doubter."</p>
<p>Claudette was happy for a moment and replied to him with another letter, which said, "You claim to be a writer, which is really a boast." (After "Doubter," she forgot to put a period to end the sentence.) (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of (New Love, Old Love)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Blinddate 丨 Cathay</p>
<p>In the minds of American filmmakers, love between men and women is often very mysterious, transcending economic or any other boundaries. Rich young masters will marry poor women, and young men from working-class backgrounds often receive the favor of noble ladies. The conclusion is that love is originally mysterious and incredible. And this is also the main thing expressed in their works. But what we usually see is not like this. Regarding this point, I remember that in the British production (The Way to Independence), it was explained very clearly that the temporary love between the factory owner's son and the female worker does exist, for a temporary need, but between them, because of the difference in economy and status, they cannot be combined after all.</p>
<p>However, we will not ignore their concept of such creation. For example, in this (New Love, Old Love), the playwright fully expresses the rich young man's benevolence, generously purchasing expensive clothing for her, and he heavily supports the lover and those she cares for. This caters to the general psychology of climbing up, and its role in lying is too obvious.</p>
<p>Judging from this, how should (New Love, Old Love) be evaluated? There is no need to explain further, but in terms of the image of expression, there are quite a few lovely places here. For example, writing about Katie's family, her younger siblings are constantly arguing, and the personalities of her father and mother are so active. Those characters are really too typical of old-fashioned families. This gives people simple laughter, and because of such a lovely performance, it gives people a lot of good feelings.</p>
<p>All the actors are very dedicated, especially those who play the mother and father are even better. Extraordinary skills express ordinary content.</p>

<h3>Film Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>One evening, Junli, Muzhi, and Zhao Dan talked about the acting skills of Chinese actors.</p>
<p>They debated from 8:00 PM to 12:30 AM, and everyone was very enthusiastic and excited.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The discussion focused on issues worth discussing for every Chinese film actor: (1) How directors and montage help actors; (2) How actors experience and cultivate themselves; (3) The degree of acting and its consistency with the plot; (4) Personality and small movements, etc.) Details will be published separately.)</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Being preoccupied with the competition for rankings in advertisements, being complacent about satisfying the vanity of being a "queen" or "beauty," and being a puppet at fashion exhibitions and opening ceremonies, being able to seriously discuss one's own art in the current state of actors' lives is worthy of our joy and worthy of our emulation.</p>
<h3>Collection of One Hundred Words</h3>
<p>— Lin Qin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The best film in terms of consciousness in the Chinese film industry in 1934 was (The Angry Tide of the China Sea) (Yihua). The film that best suited the taste of the general lower and middle-class people was (Sister Flowers) (Star). The best film in terms of technique was (Fragrant Snow Sea) (Lianhua). The best comedy was (Mr. Wang) (Tianyi).</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>If foreign investment in building film studios in China becomes a reality, then the future of China's film industry will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>One film critic said with emotion, "The lesson I have learned in the past two years is to praise more and scold less, and it is better to say less than to say more."</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Most people who run film publications have private opinions or biases. It can be said to be extremely difficult to find an impartial person among film publication editors!</p>

<h3>Meeting Again Awaiting Marriage (Forsaking All Others) (6)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Geoffrey said, "He sent me a telegram saying he got married last night." Mary's lips trembled, but she forced a smile and said, "He... he must have said he was sorry to me in the telegram, right?" Geoffrey nodded, "Yes." Mary said, "That's good. At least he has a conscience to send me a telegram. Poor Deron, no matter where he is, he always remembers me." Eleanor felt sorry for her and asked her to sit down and rest for a while. But Mary, with a pitiable voice, said, "Why sit down? The bride should be standing. Have you ever seen a bride sitting down to get married? It's not proper! It's not proper to sit down to get married! You should stand in front of the altar. And after the wedding is over! You also have to kiss the groom. But now there's no groom to kiss! He's already married Connie Barnes..." Her voice! became louder and louder. Finally, she covered her head with her hands and cried.</p>
<p>After this, Mary spent many miserable days. She moved to a rural area, lived in a wooden house, swam in the lake, rode horses, and exhausted herself to the extreme, unable to sleep at night. She knew she had to forget everything in the past. There was no point in having her heart beat for a stone. In this way, after some time, her broken heart gradually healed, and she gradually felt the beauty of the sunset without Deron's presence, and she gradually felt the pleasure of cold water on her yellow skin, and she gradually understood what it meant to live alone and be healthy.</p>
<p>Later, Geoffrey and Herbert also came, which made her even happier. Geoffrey also brought many letters. After dinner, they gathered together to open the letters, all four of them: Mary, Paula, Geoffrey, and Herbert. Mary suddenly held a letter in her hand and said to Geoffrey, "Geoffrey, listen to this;" She then read the letter: "After a long separation, we are planning to reunite. We will be waiting for you for tea at the Xizun residence at 9 pm on the 8th of this month. We hope you will grace us with your presence." Below it was signed "Connie. Deron Linda." Geoffrey listened and only replied with a grunt. But Mary said, "The 8th is the day after tomorrow. The first thing I need to do tomorrow when I go to the city is to get my hair done. The second thing is..." Geoffrey felt strange and said, "Mary... do you want to go?" Mary said, "Of course, I'll go." Geoffrey stood up, walked to Mary, sat down on a small stool at her feet, and then said, "Mary, are you confused? You must not know what that means. That woman just wants to humiliate you. You're not at all prepared for that kind of thing. Don't fall for her tricks." But Mary shook her head and said, "I don't think Connie wants me to go. But we're going anyway. See what she looks like, okay? Besides, I'm already healed, I can't even remember what Deron's eyes look like, whether he has a nose or not. What am I afraid of them?"</p>
<p>On that day, Mary indeed went to Deron's residence with Geoffrey. She met Deron in the garden after dinner. They strolled together, and soft music wafted over, and dim lights in the room were scattered on the ground. Mary had no defenses. Deron suddenly embraced Mary, kissing her fiercely, recounting his love to her again and again, and admitting his mistakes and present regrets. Mary pushed him away, but Deron refused to let her go. He pleaded, "Mary, you must listen to me. Now there's no point in talking about who's right and who's wrong. The only question now is that I have always loved you..." Just as they were in this difficult situation, Connie suddenly appeared. Obviously, she had a pre-arranged plan, which was... (To be continued)</p>

<p>Cuiwei Peak in Ningdu, Jiangxi, is extremely steep. Only this cave can lead to the top of the peak. The terrain is so dangerous that one man can hold the pass against ten thousand. When Zhu and Mao were trapped in Ningdu, a small number of residents fled to the top of the peak and resisted. All of them died heroically. Their nature was extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>(4) New Contributions from the Soviet Scientific Community</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of Dr. Keso Kov, the Soviet Scientific Research Institute is studying the changes and secretions of the original constituent composition and decomposition and analyzing the effects on various organs. It is said that most diseases are a manifestation of imbalance in the organs. This difference, that is, the unhealthy phenomenon in the human body, can be analyzed by hydrolyzing the fluid in the organs and cells of animals to find out what kind of secretion is lacking. The experimental results are very effective, attracting great attention in the world's medical and pharmaceutical circles. The picture shows the extraction of secretions from patients with equipment for analysis to determine the injection of certain fluids.</p>
