<p>（香港）上海字林西報近曾建議、港督一席、宜以極有資格之政治家任之、一方面不削减駐華與駐日英大使之職權、一方面擔任對英政府報告太平洋事伴之職務、俾英國眞正有所遵循、南華晨報與香港電聞報今日皆著論批評之、南華晨報稱港督應爲極有資格的政治家、不獨爲行政官、且爲外交官之建議、極有刺激性、此種建議、與實際大相抵觸、察字林西報之意、似責香港人士未在增進中英友誼之努力中盡其責任、吾人固承認在若千社會事件上香港確繼續開罪華人、此謂爲殖民部之過失、不如謂爲香港英人之錯誤、但此種事件僅以精神方面爲限、至於在物質合作上、香港方面近年屢有表示、而中國迄未響應、此亦爲上海所應知者、香港之鼓勵、既非近視、亦非事實、香港爲英國領土、而受英國法律之受理、英國法律在許多方面與中國法律互相抵觸、此種情形、殆未得上海充分之諒解、且香港乃海軍站及陸軍駐防地、香港與中國雙方之心理、常爲其所左右、此種事實、使香港不得不處於超然獨立之地位、若欲打破之、則唯有改變地瞬顏色耳、字林西報之心理、似以爲英政府以香港爲根據地、設法保全英國在華之勢力、以免其完全消滅、果如此說、香港責任更重、而港督一席、似非僅僅臨機應變之人材所可勝任、其人除處理市政問題外、且須有充分材能、以治理國家大事、殊不易覓得也、再港督而兼外交家與政府報告員之職務、欲不削减南京與東京駐使之職權、亦必不可能、故字林報之建議、香港縱重視之、而認爲其有價値、然將視有莫可實行之計畫、十年前香港曾有一總督、嗜好政治結果徒生衝突、如香港果需實施字林報之計畫則似非以港督爲超等大使、而將南京東京駐使之地位削爲總領事不爲功云、香港電聞報社論謂字林西報之主張以極有資格的政治家擔任港督也、直鞭策死馬耳、此種主張並非新奇、但未顧及實際、港督而兼中日外交職務之建議、殆忘却香港僅爲航業口岸、且爲南華市塲之淸算所矣、香港與中國之接觸、大都在於廣州、目前香港與廣州間之關係、較前爲佳、字林報以短視的孤立責香港、其實此種孤立、並不正確、遠不似上海心理之影響、蓋上海之心理、常未能爲中立和好關係之孤立也、在一般問題之下、香港未有須脫離殖民部管理之情勢、亦未有此種變更、認爲可行之理由、殖民部想已决定港督人物如因特殊環境、而有使香港政府與外交職務連接之必要、則所需互換意見之計劃、固已存在矣云、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>— 都</p>
<p>國定兒童年。已於八月一日開幕。舉國一致。熱烈推展。其盛况爲遐邇所具瞻。誠以兒童爲邦家未來之主人。繫國勢興替之樞紐。吾人欲謀邦本之鞏固。自以培奠始基爲要著。今得黨政當局倡導於上。地方機關奉行於下。各地之實施委會。分別組織成立。以共謀兒童之幸福事項。合全國之才彥。積歲月之努力。必能規定切實步驟。以爲一般進展準則。靑靑子衿。何幸得逢此良好之時會。剔厲智慧。乘勢發詡。前途之光輝。將靡有艾。</p>
<p>關於兒童敎養方案。名流討論。專家設計。宜不乏宏緒讜言。可資遵循。茲就實施原則上。略貢吾人之意見。</p>
<p>第一·屬於薰染方面。應爲樹立適度之軌範。兒童天眞未　。情緒爛漫。爲赤爲黑。全由所近而染。不愼之始。難圖厥終。故在師保父兄監督之下。應竭力避免惡劣之印象。正如純潔之蓓蕾。允宜多方護持。勿爲淤泥所染。對於善惡之區分。優劣之評價。可隨時由成人爲之反復提示。委宛解釋。何者爲公正。何者爲卑鄙。何者爲信義。何者爲奸欺。使兒童得一健全之人格概念。而以後不至輕易動搖其操守。在敎師固應以此爲訓育之目標。在父兄尤宜以身作若輩之準繩。然而吾輩成人。試一檢討過去。實有愧對兒童之處。吾人撫心自問。積極方面縱無主動作惡之過端。消極方面難免有放任作惡之嫌疑。國民爲一國之主人。吾人果能稍盡主人之本職否乎。他且不論。至少關於怯儒心理之存在。已爲一種莫可湔滌之罪證。如此而云準繩。寗不自覺其汗顏。爲補苴已往計。唯有毅然自掬過　。慨切指陳得失。務使未來之主人翁。曉然於國民天職之所。在勿復蹈畏却逡巡之缺。陷覆轍當。前來軫知。戒則吾人東隅之失。猶有桑榆可收。以言補過。未爲晚也。</p>
<p>第二·屬於啟迪方面。應完全以科學爲根據。兒童救育之需要以科學爲根據。固不僅爲其學業之前途計。卽就一般考量力而言。亦自有其必要性。過去靑年。未嘗無敏慧辯智者。唯於情理分野之際。迄難期認識之確切。數字之統計。不嫌龍統。是非之依違。常涉模稜。凡此判斷不明之錯誤。胥由科學觀念之缺乏。一般兒童襲受此種性質。根底所自。消除爲難。苟其自始所受敎育。卽以科學爲根據。則以逐步理喻之結果。不難漸臻頭腦於淸晰。其於一切理解之前途。寗直小補而已。此外有背科學原則之書籍。足以阻滯兒童之思想發展者。均應懸爲厲禁。絕對不使閱看。庶幾意外之戕賊得期减免。整個之向上可以促成。</p>
<p>上述兩點。要由父兄與敎師協力進行。修養與學識兼籌並顧。以期造成大多數之良好靑年。一方固在培蓄國家異日之基幹。一方亦以祓濯吾人過去之愆　。敢於兒童年開始之時。一抉斯義。亦有心人所勿容漠視者也。</p>

<p>會議情形</p>
<p>本屆大會、出席會員國、較之往年爲多、因勞工局之工作、爲世界各國所重視、再則今年有新會員國阿富汗·蘇聯·美國·等出席、而埃及爲非會員國、亦派員到會、得大會許可後、列席旁聽、本屆大會主席、爲南非聯邦政府第一代表勞工部部長克萊司衛而當選、大會副主席、一爲挪威政府代表白克·一爲羅馬尼亞僱主代表滿西耳又一爲法蘭西工人代表霍霞。大會會務之推進、計有十大委員會輔佐之、大會自第一次至第四次、皆忙於選舉正副主席、成立委員會、及選任委員等、於第五次起、方開始正式討論、</p>
<p>討論議案</p>
<p>本屆大會之議事日程、較已往爲多、如靑年失業問題、尤關迫切、故大會决議採單級制討論、而製成一建議書、送請會員國政府、予以參考、餘如减少工作時間問題、於十七十八兩屆大會、皆曾提出討論、資方除意大利外、莫不盡力反對、本屆大會、討論該問題時、資方態度、一如往昔、且僱主組主席向大會宣稱、僱主組爲避免對於該問題作細則上之討論、故拒絕出席委員會、一時會塲空氣、極度緊張、爲從事疏通起見、大會爲之休會十數日、而吾國勞工方面代表、深知國內情形、故雖不願資方有威脅之感想、同時資方代表王志聖·亦深能體察一切也、後幾經辯論、唇焦舌敝之餘、卒通過關於减少工作時間之公約草案數件、復如禁止婦女擔任礦塲地面下之工作、及保持工人遷徙後之保險應得、及旣得權等問題、討論皆有結果、製成公約、送會員國政府、準備批准、再限制煤礦工作時間公約、亦予以修止、至於假期給付工資殖民地招募工人兩問題、本屆僅作初步討論、其結果如何、尙待下屆大會决定之、</p>
<p>批准公約</p>
<p>大會對於會員國所批准之公約、是否嚴格執行、極度重視、吾國政府、業已批准之公約、本屆大會審查結果、認爲滿意、如西班牙等國、則備受責難、不堪言狀、大會之中、專司審查各國執行公約之委員會、名爲四百零八條委員會、至其名稱之所由、因其根據凡爾賽和平條約四〇八條之規定而組成、本屆吳君聞天卽被任爲該會委員之一、</p>
<p>臨時提案</p>
<p>關於臨時提案通過雖少、然均有相當價値、惟與我亞洲工人、有深切關係之亞洲勞工諮詢會議、（按並非亞洲工人會議）呈經吾國政府·及勞方代表之一致共同贊助、復由包華國吳聞天兩氏、先後登台演講、盡力發揮該會議之重要性、卒因表决之際、投票者不足法定人數、而未能通過、不無遺憾、</p>
<p>反對傾銷</p>
<p>本屆出席代表、政勞資三方合計、共一百五十九人、而三方顧問、合計爲二百五十五人、代表資格發生問題者、計有意·奧·古巴·南非聯邦·及布加利亞·等國之工人代表、勞方顧問之資格、亦有發生問題者、爲意·奧·及南非是也、對於制止傾銷、在討論國勞局長報告此事時、吾國勞工方而代表、向大會演說、卽提出此項問題、大意謂、中國於近代工工業、較爲後進、今大小各廠、深受列强探行傾銷政策之害、致無法維持、而有岌岌可危之勢、具嚴重之失業問題、遂益形加劇、末後復謂、應用國際力量、以制止此等違反公允之舉動、當時聽者、莫不動容、</p>
<p>工廠檢查</p>
<p>關於租界工廠檢查問題、各國政府勞方代表、在大會中、皆曾演說其利害、後由國際勞工局之召集、開一會議、專事討論此問題、英美法日等關係政府、皆有代表出席、當時之空氣極佳、然仍須繼續努力、方能有具體之結果、</p>
<p>今晚晋京</p>
<p>此次吾國代表團屢次在大會演講、大部份材料、由實業部分向各機關各團體搜集而得、然全國學術諮詢處、（關於靑年失業之救濟方面）國際勞工局中國分局、日內瓦國際圖書館·國際勞工局圖書館、以及國聯圖書館等機關、或則爲代爲搜羅、或則予以種種便利、殊可感也、惟統計材料、猶嫌不足、不無遺憾、據悉、王吳二人、定今晚夜快車晋京、報告一切、王錦霞卽將乘輸返漢云、</p>

<p>建築堅固</p>
<p>由上海閘北虬江路起、至無錫火車站東北首止、全綫共計一百三十九公里、路面甚寬、建築非常堅固、路面舖以石屑、故甚平坦、車行時毫無顚簸之苦、惟全綫橋樑頗多、過橋時、如汽車速力在四十碼以上時、略有顚簸、且全綫共有橋樑約二百數十座之多、查車行橋時、所以顚簸之原因、實因路面與橋樑兩頭銜接處、並不齊平所致、望該公司有以改進也、</p>
<p>遊程支配</p>

<p>— 黃火培</p>
<p>上海市地方協會既於民國二十二年編印上海市統計，復於二十二年，踵前編之後，編印補充材料，仍分土地，人口，行政，司法，財政，金融，商業，工業，勞工，交通，公用事業，文化事業，教育，社會，及衛生各門，惟農業門以甫經實地調查，相距祇一年，暫從闕略。其材料大部分補充至二十二年止，亦有補充至二十三年止者。</p>

<p>江梅關二十一年銀進口五千四百零二萬餘兩，出口二千九百二十萬餘兩，尚是進口多於出口。二十二年進口七千五百七十五萬餘兩，出口八千五百一十五萬餘兩，已出口多於進口了。</p>

<p>上海全市離婚者統計，二十二年五百〇三件。就中以意見不合者爲最多數，計四百五十二件，占百分之八九·八六。較之二十一多八十八件。</p>

<p>上海全市暗殺事件，二十二年一百二十六件，較二十一年多二十六件。</p>
<p>上海市每千人死亡率，二十二年得百分之八·六五，視二十一年微高，視其他各年均大減。其在公共租界中國居民每千人死亡率，二十一年得百分之一七·六，較前略高。二十二年得百分之一二·八，較前大減。</p>
<p>是書所用材料之來源，均就表末注明，一如前編。右所列舉，雖僅窺豹一斑。然就經濟情形，略加考較，已足覘上海市之不景氣，已至嚴重境界。而不人口轉增言之，尤足爲內地農村破產之一反映。追往思來，不禁惄然如搙也。</p>

<p>日本立敎大學乒乓隊與上海聯隊之戰、在萬目睽睽中、競賽於中央大會堂、結果上聯以五比三大勝立敎、爲吾華人揚眉吐氣、精彩百出、殊屬難能可貴、尤以陳振聲君擊敗屢戰屢勝之唐宮、爲全塲最注目之一局、但上聯隊長盧仲球君與掘川之戰、盧君曾三戰三勝之、而前晚正將開賽之際、電炬忽告失明、盧君爲熱心維持秩序、以致精疲力盡、倉卒應戰、反被掘川所屈、非球藝疏忽之罪也、至於鄧國富君應戰立敎主將石橋一幕，鄧君久病初痊、尙未復健康、表　得驚險萬狀、雖以二比三見挫於石橋、敗亦　榮也、茲將前晚戰績附後、</p>

<p>正風中學改進計劃</p>
<p>本市正風中學自創始以來、已有十餘年之歷史、本年暑假開始時、原任黃校長、以供職江蘇監察使署、不克兼顧校務、迭請辭去校董及校長兩職、經該校第三次校董會議議决、准予辭職、並選任校董吳開先爲董事長、校董胡昌治繼任校長、查胡君爲我國敎育專家、學識經　、涵養甚深、此次接收以後、對於校務方面改進甚多、昨日胡校長復以所擬校務改進計晝、發表大綱加左、</p>
<p>第一關於物質建設方而　上海爲中外文化薈萃之區、交通頻繁、人才麕集、靑年求學於此旣足養成靈活之手腦、復可觀感進取之途徑、唯廛空氣惡濁、居民生活奢侈、是其大病、本校有校址地近徐家匯、與國立交通大學稅務專門學校毘連、地旣淸僻、交通亦便、證諸上列所舉利弊、各點實佔優良之地位、然以校舍不廣、發展勢受限制、茲經本校確定預算、先於本年度內、在附近徵求空地縱橫面積須在二十畝以上、以二分之一闢爲運動塲、並建築肺癆病療癢所及砂眼學生隔離室、以備學生鍛鍊體格之用、其餘空地、建築正風圖書館一座、即將現有校內圖書館遷入、並添置新出圖書五千冊、旁附閱報室、以爲學生課餘進修之助、此項工程大約三四月即可完成、二十五年度開始時、即可應用、至二十五年度第一學期開始後、復在該處餘地建築三層樓學生宿舍兩座、敎室及辦公室三層大樓一座、預計六個月、可以竣工、至第二學期開始時、即可將現有校舍全部遷入、即將來學生人數、復有增加、亦有餘地、可資擴充、</p>
<p>第二關於心理建設方面　精神爲事業之骨體、心理爲行事之動向、故　校於物質建設以外、復致力於心理建設方面、溯自最近一百年來、中國民族因遭受外來勢力之侵襲、沮喪頹敗、幾有丞亟不可終日之勢、中等學校爲敎育歷程中重要階段、對此殊難忽視、本校今後計畫、擬以全體敎師、以身作則之方法、養成一種刻苦耐勞勇往邁幹之學計，遇事進取有自知之明、故不退縮見善、則遷有忠誠之志、故不落伍、惟此種學風之養成、端在平時訓　之功、决算一朝一夕所能奏效而訓導之方、其最要者在於優良之教師、否則表率未立興感難生、故本校下學期起、即擬秉此方針敦請學長之名師、擔任教席秉三民主義之教育原理、盡量於學生生活之各方面、作有益之指導、並於訓育主任以下、設置各級級一任導師、組織學生生活指導委員會與學生共同生活、共同進修、隨時隨地爲學生表率、　幾日積月累、得收潛移默化之效、此外若敎務方而之釐訂、敎材進程、增加實騐工作、限制學生請假舉行嚴格考試等項、亦均爲該校長改進計畫中所論及者、以事涉瑣屑、故不具載云、</p>

<h3 id="c156">小男兒（四） <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>「你看過了蜀姨母沒有？」他問道，彷彿這是一種重要的禮節。</p>
<p>「我除你們孩子外，還沒有見過別人；我正在等着，」乃德回答道。「勞笠叔送你來的嗎？」小橋又以溫和而又莊重的語調接續說道。</p>
<p>「勞先生送我來的。」</p>
<p>「他就是勞笠叔叔；他總是送好孩子來的。」</p>
<p>乃德聽到了這句評論，不由地臉上表出舒暢滿足的神情，微微一笑，使他削瘦的臉也覺得是十分可愛的呢。他不知道再說些什麼話，因此二人便相審視，作無語的默契，直到一個小姑娘挾了她的囡囡兒跑了過來。她很像小橋，只不過沒有那麽高，並且有較紅較圓的臉兒，和一雙籃色的眼睛。</p>
<p>「這是我的妹妹名呌小梅，」小橋聲言道，彷彿是在介紹一們希罕而又珍貴的寶貝一般。</p>
<p>小孩們相互點了頭：那小姑娘的臉兒上像是充滿了快樂，深深地顯出了兩個笑渦，接着她以親愛的神色說道：</p>
<p>「我望你能够留着。我們裏過的多麽有趣的日子；不是嗎，小橋。」</p>
<p>「自然，這便是蜀姨母所以來梅莊的理由。」</p>
<p>「這眞像是一個很好的地方，」乃德也加入他的意見道，覺得他在這兩個和氣的少年人面前，也不容不說幾句話的。</p>
<p>「這是世界上最好的地方；小橋，不是嗎？」小梅說道，她顯然當她的哥哥最是閎博精通的。</p>
<p>「不，我想格林蘭的地方，那邊有冰山，有海獅，比這裏還要有趣呢。不過我也愛梅莊，這確是一個很好的地方，能够在這裏住着，也是很好的了，」小橋回答道，他其時正在閱看一本關於格林蘭的書呢。（註五）他正想展開那　書，給乃德看其中的幾個圖盡，再加說明，忽然那個女僕已經回來，向着客室門口一點頭，說道：『行；你可以留在這兒。』</p>
<p>『我高興呀；現在去看蜀姨母去。』小梅說了，便牽了乃德的一個手神氣上像是保護他的模樣，看去何等可愛，這立使乃德將生疎落寞的恐懼，完全丟去了。</p>

<p>— 翔明</p>
<p>小朋友，你看見那些運動家嗎？他們有强壯</p>
<p>的體魄，堅實的肌肉，臉上流露着英氣，脚踏着有力的步伐；處處顯出他們的英雄氣概，小朋友，你看了羨慕嗎？</p>
<p>然而怎樣纔能做一個眞正的運動家，只要在課後時常去運動，你喜歡那一種你就去練習那一種，但是正當的功課，不要荒廢，這正如造房子般的打好了基礎，那麼一層層的造上去，也不會十分吃力的了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們是中國未來的主人翁，你們要有强健的體格，和良好的學問，才能把這陷在水深火熱中的中國救出來。</p>
<p>小朋友，願你做一個眞正的運動家，不要倣一個胸無點墨的運動家才好。</p>

<p>— 易生</p>
<p>范宣愛身</p>
<p>范宣八歲時在後園挑菜，誤傷了他自己的手指，不覺大聲啼哭起來。旁人問他：「是爲痛麼？」「不，只爲想起書本上說的：「身體膚髮，受諸父母，不敢毀傷，」所以我哭了！」他回答。</p>
<p>不論誰的肉體，都是由父母傳下，要替社會人羣服務的，原該各自愛護着不使受傷。這范宣所提的書句出於孝經，是敎人注重自愛就合孝道。他在非常狀態之下還能不忘記平日所受書本上的敎育，這是値得我們敬愛而效法的。</p>
<p>孔融的辯才</p>
<p>孔融幼年求見當代一位姓李的大官。那李宦的架子很大，因爲每天登門的賓客太多，應接不暇，所以吩咐司閽人，凡是親戚故舊來見纔許通報。孔融早巳聽得有這辦法，當時告訴司閣人說他和主人家是世代通家，纔得達到謁見的目的。李宦問起他：「你說我們是有通家世誼的麼？」他立卽回言：「不是麼？你不記得我家聖人和你家老子的一段交誼了麼？」主人正在極口稱許他，忽有在座的一位賓客揷口道：「小時了了，大未必佳！」孔融轉身應道：「想你老先生定是小時了了的了。」那位客人頓時啞口無言。</p>
<p>江南有俗諺道：「三歲定八歲，八歲定終身。」這便是說觀察一個人幼年的言行，可以知其一生了。像孔融這麼敏捷的口才原出天賦，不是人力所可强學的。究寬他成爲漢末一代的名宦名儒，可知那俗諺是不錯的。</p>

<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>若是生來不是啞子，那說話便是天賦我們的權利。</p>
<p>性子躁急的人，見到生人，一經寒喧之下，便滔滔不絕地長談細說。那口齒不伶俐的人，一見生客却又胆怯怯地講不出一句話來。這兩種態度，都有點不大適當。</p>
<p>「天生我們耳朶有兩個，口却只有一張。」</p>
<p>「無論怎樣蠢笨，你不開口，人家是不會識破的。」這些話是警戒人小心說話的。從另一方面說起來，「惟有談話可以破除沉悶的空氣：惟有談話可以打踴彼此的隔膜；可以融和疏遠的感情。</p>
<p>初次和生客見面，談話務須從容不迫。不要性急口快。說大話，發大聲，一味和同座絮聒而不顧旁座的人，這些毛病，都應避免。</p>
<p>「你錯了！」「我看不是這樣。」「豈有此理！」「哼！」（從鼻孔出聲）這些不客氣的口吻，都要注意避免。</p>
<p>「請你原諒。」「對不住。」「我想是…」這種謙遜的口氣是不妨常用的。</p>
<p>對方正談得起緊時，不要和他爭鋒。</p>
<p>對方顯倦態時，不要和他刺刺不休。</p>
<p>話不投機，不必多談。</p>
<p>發怒或憤氣的時侯，要竭力抑制講話</p>
<p>對人發問，要帶謙和的態度，說聲「請問……」</p>
<p>對方發問，要明白淸晰，有條有理的回答他。</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>兒童年開幕了，敏兒召集了鄰家的小朋友，開一個小小的司樂會，來慶祝這快樂的兒童年。</p>
<p>敏兒的爸爸特地買了許多的糖果分送給他們，敏兒一見了糖果，便先自拿了許多，他的哥哥！聰兒責備他道：</p>
<p>「弟弟，你眞不懂禮貌，不先分給些鄰家的小朋友們，而自己拿了這許多，你昨天不是牙痛嗎？」</p>
<p>「哥哥，是的，但是糖能帮助消化的，所以我要多吃，並且又香又甜，一得兩便，不吃，豈不是傻了嗎？」敏兒的嘴裏含着糖，嘰哩咕囉的說着。</p>
<p>「少吃，才能帮助消化；多吃了，胃液要發酸，消化就遲緩，如果糖在嘴裏分解，便要損害牙齒，所以你是時常牙痛的。」</p>
<p>「媽媽不是說冰糖能治咳嗽的麽？那麽我吃冰糖好了。」</p>
<p>「冰糖也就是糖，不過精製一點罷了，多吃也是不行的。」</p>
<p>「噢！我不多吃糖就是了，但我不知道它是怎樣做成的？」</p>
<p>「糖是甘蔗和甜菜做的：我國大都是用甘蔗做，在早晨把它割下來，削去蔗皮放在石轆裏壓榨，榨出來的液汁，在鐵鍋裏煮沸，便有汚穢的東西浮在上面，逐漸撈去。再加石灰，經過了一二小時取出，用布濾過。再用弱火蒸發，到液汁濃後，放在泠的鍋子裏，用棒不住的攪拌，冷到適當的時侯，倒在瓦盆裏，使它結晶，就成赤砂糖。從赤砂糖提去糖蜜，可成白糖。把白糖溶在水裏，使成濃液，放在甕裏，便能漸漸凝結成半透明的固體，這就是冰糖。」</p>
<p>「甘蔗，這裏能不能栽培的？」</p>
<p>「這裏不能，甘蔗喜生長在溫暖地方，所以廣東，福建出產很多。」</p>
<p>「我們常見的甘蔗有那幾種？」</p>
<p>「有兩種，靑皮的叫竹蔗。紅皮的叫崑崙蔗。」</p>
<h3 id="c162">軟水與硬水（常識） <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>小朋友！自然先生也許已經告訴了你們吧？水有地面水和地底水的分別。今天在這里所要講的軟水就是地面水；硬水就是地底水。現在且扼要地把它分析這樣：</p>
<p>夏天，是使人該流汗的季節。因此手帕和毛巾已成爲我們日常的必需品，可是，它們有時竟會慢慢的變成黑色而且發硬；但是有些地方的手帕和毛巾，甚至用破了還是白而軟的。這並不是汗水與手帕的質地關係，而是水的問題。又如銅茶壺，有的地方雖然用了很久還是很乾掙的；有的地方却會生成一層厚厚的汚垢。這也不是甩的長久與銅的木質無關係。亦是水的關係。更如：有的地方的水，能使人的皮膚滋潤：但有的地方的水，却會使人的皮膚粗糙，這亦是水的關係。總之，凡使毛巾手帕變黑變硬；使銅茶壼污垢！使皮膚粗糙，都是水的關係，係硬水而非軟水。</p>
<p>凡水中不含礦物雜質者叫軟水；含有這種雜質者叫硬水。因爲這一種雜質，假如與其他物質發生化合作用，所以其他的東西，要受其損害。</p>
<p>（一）硬水中含有的硝酸，硫酸等，侵蝕到柔軟的棉織物，（如手帕毛巾）其柔軟性因爲被水分的剝奪而减少，更因爲吸收了其他的礦雜質而變黑變硬。</p>
<p>（二）硬水經火力煮沸後，則有若干礦雜質沈澱，使積汚垢，同時因爲蒸發酸分侵入本質，所以非常容易使其腐爛，</p>
<p>（三）硬氷侵蝕到了人的皮膚，那末脂肪就與酸分化合，便能使皮膚粗糙。</p>
<p>不消說，井水泉水，因爲都在地底下流動，當然含有礦雜質亦較多，所以每多硬水。上海的自來水，亦有的是地底水，（像自流井）必須要經過有極細密的濾過及化學作用的手續，方可除去其硬度。但是有些私人的自流井，都因爲了經濟問題，致設備簡陋，所以尤多硬水，這是我們該要注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c163">木馬（勞作） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>小朋友！兒童年開幕了，你們一定很歡喜；很高興；爲什麼呢？因爲你們是一個好孩子，爸爸和媽媽給你穿新的衣服，來慶祝兒童節，在學校裏的先生們給你許許多多的獎品，所以我也來敎你做一隻小玩具木馬來玩玩吧！</p>
<p>材料　你們先要準備各種的材料，（一）分開一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九的小木頭，（預備做人）（二）分開一、二、三、四、木頭，（預備做馬）（三）長木頭，（預備做架子）（四）鐵釘，（五）螺絲釘，（六）碎紙，（七）剪好的紙頭，（預備做馬尾）（八）鉛絲，材料的大小，依（三）的木頭爲標準。</p>
<p>做法　材料預備好以後，先把（一）的一木頭二木頭三木頭釘好如圖（一）。把（二）的一木頭二木頭三木頭釘好如圖（二）。再把（三）的木頭和（八）的鉛綠做架子，做好以後，其他依着上圖照樣去做，就成一隻小玩具木馬了！</p>
<h3 id="c164">怎樣改正讀書時的壞習慣？（談話） <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，有幾種讀書的壞習慣。你們平常在讀書時所琉忽的，現在特地提出來談談，希望你們大家起來改正才好。</p>
<p>第一種壞習慣，便是稍爲懂得一點，就算了。這對於國語常識方面吃虧倒還小，可是對於算術方面却不行！因爲算術這樣功課在開頭沒有弄懂，越到後來，越弄不淸楚啦！所以在考試時，呆吞吞地做不出來，那是多麽難過呵！</p>
<p>第二種壞習慣，是貪，這本瞧瞧，那本翻翻，結果耗費了許多寶貴的光陰，一本也沒有看成功。</p>
<p>第三種壞習慣，是沒有恒心。高興的時候讀讀，不高興時，便一味玩着。那讀書如何會進步呢？</p>
<p>小朋友，你們要改正第一種壞習慣，先要備置一本筆記簿，把不明瞭的字句摘錄下來，問問同學或先生，一定要弄懂才罷！第二種壞習慣，我們必須先揀定一本，這一本沒有瞧完和弄瞧，無論如何不翻另一本，還有第三種壤習慣，我們必定要訂一張自修時間表，養成天天有定時的讀書習慣。這你們不但可以解决考試的難關，並且可以增進你們的讀書興趣，獲得高深的知識和學問。</p>
<p>好了，希望小朋友們努力改正壞習慣吧。</p>
<h3 id="c165">暑月的玩具（勞作） <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 徐寶璋</p>
<p>小朋友！咱們除讀書學習之外，還應該自己動手，創造些東西出來！不但覺得十分有趣，而且足以發現咱們小朋友的聰明智慧呢。現在便利交通的汽船火車，不是有了瓦特小時候壺蓋掀動的發明，後來纔發明嗎？現在功用萬能的電，不是有了福蘭克林小時候放紙鳶的發明，後來一件件的發明嗎？小朋友，咱們快來發明吧！</p>
<p>這幾天，是炎熱的暑月，咱們小朋友坐在庭院裏納凉，講講故事笑話，猜猜謎語，是非常有趣的。但，咱們小朋友能够再做幾件玩具玩玩，不是更有趣嗎？</p>
<p>（一）西瓜燈　把渾圓的西瓜，剜出裏面的　，小朋友大家吃了消暑。在瓜皮上，畫些花鳥，寫些字句，慢慢地依照書畫的痕跡，剜去綠皮。瓜底揷一小釘，以便燃燭之用。四角繁了繩，掛在庭中。夜裏燃起燭來，遠遠看去，花鳥栩栩若生，綠色燈　四射，不是十分美麗嗎？要是摹倣走馬燈的製法，畫了五六個影人，綴在紙輪的下面，輪貫以軸，揷在瓜中。燭旣燃了，紙輪旁的空氣，因熱流動，冷空氣來補其缺，便發生了風，推動紙輪，旋轉不已。遠遠瞧去，人物行動如生，很像觀電影一般，更覺有趣。</p>
<p>（二）荷花燈　用篾片紮成荷燈，糊以紅綠黃白等顏色的紙，裏面燃了小燭。或用蛤殼，中儲菜油燈芯，燃了起來，放在池塘之中。浮沉上下，像無數閃爍的明星，麗綴水中，煞是好看。</p>
<p>此外把透明的紙，摺成螢籠，捉幾頭螢放在裏面，螢火熠熠地映出來，也且一種很好的玩具。暑月旣過，凉風徐來，瞿瞿唧唧的秋蟲，應時產生，這是我們很快樂的季節。蟋蟀籠，金鈴子籠，聒聒兒籠，又是小朋友們自己能做的玩具啊。</p>
<h3 id="c166">兒童年言志 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>這一天風和日麗，雖然在夏季，郤並不覺得炎熱，正好像鶯飛草長的暮春天氣一樣。那時是傍晚六點鐘光景，斜陽漸漸西下，恰照在市梢一座小小的花園裏。園中兩株高大的梧桐樹，黃澄澄地好似塗上了一層黃金，樹下的一片草地上，有幾個小朋友，圍坐着，他們的面前放着許多糕餅糖果書畫玩具，說着笑着，十分高興，原來他們正在舉行一個慶祝兒童年開幕的同樂會。</p>
<p>內中一個年齡較長的孩子起立說道：「諸位，兒童年開幕了，這一年對於我們兒童有極重大的意義，我們不可輕輕放過，今天的同樂會也應當做一些有意義的事情可不能吃吃玩玩，說說笑笑，就算完事。」</p>
<p>當下大家同聲說道：「不錯不錯，我們應當做一些有意義的事情，但是我們預備怎樣的做呢？今天你是主席，就請你發表意見。」</p>
<p>主席低頭想了一想，纔又開口說道：「我們學校裏的敎師說得好：「人各有志，各人在做小孩子的時候，就應該立志，將來長大成人，便可照着志向進行。」所以我想乘着今天兒童年開幕的日子，大家來說說自已對於將來的志向吧。」</p>
<p>小朋友們一致舉手的說道：「贊成！贊成！但是請那一個先說？」</p>
<p>主席道：「照我們姓的筆畫多少爲次序，那一個筆畫最少就請那一個先說。」</p>
<p>於是一個姓丁的小朋友站起來說道：「我姓丁，祇有二畫，就讓我來先說：我的父親是在洋行中做買辦的，每月有幾千塊錢的收入，天天穿的是西裝，吃的是大菜住的是洋房，坐的是汽車，看他多麼的舒服，所以我長大起來，也要像我父親一樣，做一個洋行買辦。」</p>
<p>接着一個姓王的小朋友站起來說道：「我姓王，祇有四畫，讓我第二個來說：我的伯伯是一個大律師，他的名氣很大，收入很多，雖然不做洋行買辦，一樣的住洋房坐汽車，所以我將來也想做大律師。</p>
<p>接着一個姓包的小朋友站起來說道：「我姓包，祇有五畫，讓我第三個來說：我的叔叔是一個縣長，要管一縣幾百里的地方老百姓都稱他縣老爺，地方上的一切事情，都由他作主，身份旣高，收入也多，我想做官比什麽都好，所以我將來也要做官。</p>
<p>接着一個姓任的小朋友站起來說道：「做一個縣長有什麼希罕？當文官那有當武官好，不見我的舅父，他在軍隊中做師長，手下有兵士幾萬，無論是營長，團長，旅長，都要聽他一人指揮是多麼的威風！所以我的志向，將來也要做師長去。」</p>
<p>接着一個姓李的小朋友站起來說道：「你們的志向，都不是我的志向，我在學校中最喜歡的是國語和圖畫，每學期的成績總在九十分以上，據我父親說：要是好好的用功，將來可以做一個文學家和美術家，祇要本領好，也一樣可以掙大洋錢的，並且名氣也大，身份也高，所以我的志向已決定了。</p>
<p>接着一個姓胡的小朋友站起來說道：「我的志向是再高沒有了，和你們的完全不同。你道是什麽？原來我是想做一個飛行家的。將來我可以坐了一架飛機，在天空中高高的飛，飛，飛着，任我自由自在的往來，這是多麼的有趣！萬一和別國開起戰來，我還可以替國家出力哩。」</p>
<p>最後那主席笑了一笑，站起來說道：「我姓陳，筆畫最多，祇得挨在末尾來說了。我對於諸位的志向，除了做飛行家外，別的一個都不敢贊成。我從今年上學期起，聽了幾位敎師的演講，就志在科學，因爲科學是可以救國的。諸位要知道我們中國這樣的窮，這樣的弱，就爲了科學不發達的緣故。科學的包括很廣，我們先從虎學，自然兩門用功起來，進了中學再注重物理和化學，一步步研究上去，將來大有用處。我打算在科學上做一番事業，先要發明幾件有益於大眾的新物品，一面開礦以取原料，開廠以便宜製造，這志向雖大，但我定須努力做去，願諸位也一樣的努力，立志做一個科學家。」</p>

<p>老多悅手　期粉漲風昨日粉市、初平繼挺、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續跌六八角左右、坎拿大跌二角、故初開時、市塲人心、頗形平定、旋則因金價步步騰貴、重至九百十餘元、致一部分人心、以外滙縮短、此後對洋麥之訂購、暫行當少希望、是以業外買氣、頗見俏利、惟大戶老多頭、仍有回脫、漲度遂覺無幾、至福新現貨、月底開四角三分、前日開四角、不免鬆濫、往後升沉、與外滙大有關係、因目下現洋麥之喊價、較前月巳高四五角、非外滙凑近、自少活動之力也、結果本月份較好七厘半、九十月份各好一分、十一月份好半分、十二月份好二厘半、一月份好一分云、</p>
<p>期麥隨金價上漲</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致穩俏、因洋麥雖仍報跌二角至六八角不等、惟以金價又見暴長、與洋麥之訂購、自然發生關係、故市塲人心，因此反見安定、開價即較前日高起三四分、以後則交易轉淸、市趨盤旋、至內地麥價、目下仍難合劃、故無特殊情形、未看過低也、結果本月份較漲三分，九月份漲三分、十月份漲四分、十一十二月份漲三分、現麥市面、仍然穩固、北市最高開六角二分、南市最高開六角半、開合肥明光麥三元六角、南京麥三元四角二三分、寶應麥三元五角六分、丹陽麥三元五角一分、六合麥三元五角半、高資麥三元五角四分、臨淮關麥三元六角、張八嶺麥三元六角一分、由阜豐去六千包、福新廠去四千包、信大去一千包云、</p>

<p>米市況、以金價上漲、產價步昂、行商心思仍堅、意在擯持不出、但本客去化又呆、全日交易甚微、浮囤方面不免心虛欲脫、且以各地新米上市日近、一部份心思又在看小、適以去化一减、市面隨即降平、全日開出西貢三號及碎米等三千多包、小絞蘇粳地高貢暹邏各米二千包、行情均與前市相近、惟實際上巳暗小二三分矣、</p>

<p>當宣傳巳久的兒童年，正盛大的在全國舉行開幕典禮的前日，報載冀　縣徐姓小學敎師，因患肺病，竟買一貧家兒童，活烹啖下的新聞。這似乎有意地爲兒童年揭幕，告訴這彩烈輝煌的幕後，是怎樣地悽凉慘酷！無辜的兒童隨着貧窮的父母，被棄賣或被殺戮，已是司空見慣的事情。祇要不健忘，總尙能記起不久以前，曾有過父母帶了子女，「跳高樓」「吞生雅片」自殺的慘事。所以兒童年的實施，與其多爲富家公子設計，不如多顧及流離失所或沉浮在飢餓綫上的貧苦兒童。如廣設勞働托兒所育嬰院，敎養院等，均屬急要之事。這樣不但造福於大多數未來主人翁的兒童，且亦爲掙扎於死亡綫上的婦女，减少一分重擔，開一綫生路。</p>

<p>— 順</p>
<p>近來報紙傳來一種使我們注目的消息，就是湯玉麟之妻，逃脫家庭，此事本極平常，但事起於權貴人家，故給一般人之印象，格外深刻。</p>
<p>關於湯玉麟之妻，訴夫　法，似乎尙未惹起社會輿論，權貴人家，竟發生此項破廉恥事，影響所及，將不堪設想，我們站在婦女立塲，固應有評論之權，在糾正社會風化之見地，亦當有評定其是非，以警後來者之必要。</p>
<p>據大美晚報七月二十五日載，湯玉麟之髮妻湯劉氏不堪湯之虐待，離家赴津，委託包楊律師向湯交涉，據述其離家原因：「湯君專嗜偏寵，秉性粗暴，閨門以內鞭撻橫施久巳視爲當然，氏處此暴威之下，唯知委曲求全，原企偕老，而羣妾包圍，日以傾軋爲事，湯君受其鼓惑對氏慘下毒手，（不願列舉事實，亦不忍列舉事實）實無人道之可言，二十年同居感情，若非生女哭求，性命幾於不保，言念及此，肉顫心驚，近復對我母女益加虐待，有如眼中之釘，必圖拔去，惡意遺棄巳極顯著，似此朝夕不保之惡劣環境，實難再與同居，爰携所生之女，空手逃避來津，爲生命安全起見，萬無再行回歸，重入羅網之理』云云</p>
<p>在這告訴中，我們可以看出有　於婦女利益者三點。。</p>
<p>第一點，湯玉麟憑其權勢，廣置姬妾，視婦女爲玩物。</p>
<p>第二點，湯玉麟倚仗强權，對同居二十年之髮妻，「鞭撻橫施」「慘下毒手」，實無人道之可言。</p>
<p>第三點，湯玉麟爲前熱河省主席，以一省長官之尊嚴，竟作多妻生活，且對髮妻橫加鞭撻，此風一長，上行下效，全國婦女將與湯劉氏河其命運。</p>
<p>人們說，從來軍　，勇於內戰，怯於外敵，斯言誠是，湯固一軍閥也。當日侵熱河時，湯揚言義軍不聽命令，棄甲曳兵而走，此其對外者，今又以虐待髮妻被控，家庭內事，暴露無遺，此則湯某，旣不能攘外，復不能安內，於是軍閥之原形畢露！</p>
<p>總之，位居一省之長的湯玉麟，擁羣妾而虐待髮妻，實罪大惡極，但我們爲婦女前途計，必須加以嚴厲的批判與無情的攻擊！</p>

<h3 id="c175">第六節私生兒及其母親 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>在資本主義社會，終身的一夫一妻制是法制的道德的理想，而私通的一夫多妻制是普遍的現實的實踐。一個男子除了一個法定的妻子外，還有妾婢，有姘婦，更有娼婦，任情淫靡，這是很公然，很平常的事。國家的法律以及社會的道德的輿論，固不去責備他，他自已也不覺得這是不道德的行爲，但假使一個婦女除了法定的丈夫外，同其他男子發生私姘關係，那是彌天大罪，法律便馬上把她捉將官裏去，社會輿論也認爲不貞淫婦，决定她終身的運命。這就是資本主義社會的「神聖的」一夫一妻制的裏面和表面。</p>
<p>可是，這種不合理的制度，必然產生出不合理的結果來。這個結果，就是市民社會所認爲「罪惡的結晶品」的私生兒。資本主義國家的法律是把一切一夫一妻制墻外生出來的生命，認爲罪惡的果實，付以私生兒的烙印，剝奪他的公民權，把他掉棄於法律保護範圍外。但這裏被犧牲的不僅是私生兒本身，即私生兒的母親也被看作「罪惡之魔」。受人們的鄙視，結束了她一生的幸福，而另一面該男子的正妻亦爲愛情的犧牲者，這是必須注意之點。</p>
<p>私生兒的母親，大都是未成年的貧苦婦女及零落破產的中產婦女。她們要在黃金握在現子手裏的社會關係中求生存，往往在男子的誘惑，欺騙及威迫中墜入情網，但這無異於　入十八層地獄裏，永無回頭之期。她們所生下來的子女以及她自身，不得不在不見天日的黑暗中生活。她們一想到這裏，便毅然出以絕望的行爲——自殺，殺兒，打胎等等，但所謂輿論給她們的仍然還是罪惡之名。却不肯在這社會制度中找出她的罪惡之根源來！</p>
<p>市民階級爲了嚴守一夫一妻的光榮，把幾百幾十萬的私生兒，處以「胎兒之罪」，剝奪其公民權。法國拿破崙的法典是禁止私生兒認出自己的父親。德國民法的一五八九條是「不承認私生兒和其父親的親族關係。」尤其，阿根廷的法律是規定：「因近親相奸或奸通而生的子女，不得有父親和母親，且禁止認出其父親和母親。父親甚至母親也不得承認他們爲子女。」</p>
<p>以上諸原則，直至世界大戰時止，各國家族法中成爲不動的眞理。但一九一二年十一月十六日法國的法律是有例外的修改，卽「除了强奸和誘奸外，在誘惑的塲合，事實上同居的塲合，父親承認其子女的塲合，都承認其父子關係。」</p>
<p>那末，資本主義國家爲什麽要剝奪私生兒的「生活權」呢？御用學者美塞爾是最率直的說出這個原因，他說：</p>
<p>「對於由淫蕩而出生的子女，給予與合法出生的子女一樣的命運，那不是國家的利益。爲什麽呢？因爲假使這樣的話，要正式結婚的動機將被消滅的原故。……又對於無結婚生活給予與有結婚生活同樣的幸福，那也不是國家的利益，爲什麽？因爲家庭的狀態，較之自由的獨身者們的狀態，更有利於國家，更有助於國家的原故。」</p>
<p>這就是市民社會對這問題的全部哲學，也就是國家掉棄無數私生兒的無辜生命的主要原因。</p>
<p>這樣，社會剝奪私生兒的生活權之結果，他們的死亡率倍於嫡出子。據一九二〇年德國的調查，出生者一百人中的死亡率，嫡出子占一一·九，私生兒則占二三·〇·又據輸列德爾的調查，嫡出子嬰兒死亡者爲七分之一，私生子嬰兒死亡者爲四分之一。又據同氏的調查，私生兒的母親的大部分屬於勞苦階級。例如一九〇六年普魯士出生的九萬四千七百七十七名私生兒的母親中，四二％爲家庭傭婦，一〇％爲農業勞動婦女，二二％爲工業勞動婦女。</p>
<p>許多生物畢者，對於私生兒蒐集種種生物的，道德的及智的缺陷的證據，拿來證明私生兒缺乏人類的價値的事實。但其中有着科學的良心的學者們却也承認私生兒的優越的天賦的價値。現代德國最大敎育家奧特紐來是這樣主張：</p>
<p>「在私生兒間，確有肉體的及精神的退化者。但這現象並不比嫡出子多。不僅如此，私生兒的生活力往往比嫡出子優秀。爲什麽？因爲私生兒的大部分，是從眞正的戀愛關係中出生，而且在他們的兩親正是花一樣美麗的時代出生的原故。」</p>
<p>資本主義國家的法律，雖用種種方法阻止私生兒出生的必然過程，但其出生者數目却也一天天增大起來。據可鑫的調查，德國在最近五年間，私生兒數有四〇％的增加，在現在有二百五十萬名的私生兒，這是暴露了現代一夫一妻制度的一大破洞。有人說：「在現代社會早巳不存在所謂結婚，」這話决不是沒有理由的！</p>
<h3 id="c176">廣西苗人的結婚生活 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>苗，猺都伏居在廣西的深山裏，因爲交通的不便，他們還停留在「老死不相往來」的階段；所以各種風俗習慣，都不能互相溝通，而有「五里不同風，十里不同俗」的現象；結婚方式當然亦不能例外。這裏預備介紹的，是限於廣西北部苗山中的一部份苗民的情形，在闡明結婚方式之前，先擬叙述男女間的社交情形。在那邊靑年男女，並不受「男女授受不親」的拘束；只要互相認識以後，男子就可以在女子家中徹夜閒談，歌唱對答，自由的淘醉在甜蜜的戀愛生活中，這就是在苗人間通行的「坐妹」。</p>
<p>這樣經過相當時期以後，在雙方認爲可以訂婚，就由男子提出，請求自己的父母，托媒人到女家求婚，只要得到女家父母的允許，訂婚便在雙方的口頭契約上决定了。此後每逢節氣，或農忙時期，男家可把女子接來，甚至女子的姐妹羣，亦常伴隨來家，帮同工作，如挑柴烹飪等農事或家事工作。不過居住的時間，只能單夜，如三夜，五夜等。這種情形，經常的繼續着，直到結婚爲止。</p>
<p>經過二三年以後，就開始結婚生活，他們結婚時期，大多在每年新正的初三四左右。在結婚之前，男家須準備一二担或三四担糯米，鴉，魚，炮竹，以及一兩二（合小洋一元六角）銀子的聘金，以作送親之禮。女家的妝奩，亦同樣簡單，只要棉被一套，箱子兩隻，織布機及紡紗車各一具。有時亦有以牛爲陪嫁物，這大概以各人家庭的經濟情形而定，不過其差異，亦甚微細。在結婚之前一二日或三五日，先由媒人把女子接到男家來。當出發時，新娘在三四女伴護送之下，携着一升又三抓的白米，在靜悄悄的午夜，開始離開母家，到早上四五點鐘，新娘方能跑進丈夫的家中。這時新郎須避匿在外，而家人亦靜不作聲，在媒人及女伴帮同之下，舉行隆重的婚禮。婚禮的儀式是這樣，在灶的旁邊，擺起酸魚酸肉，以及鴉酒之類，面新娘，媒人以及女伴，都圍坐灶旁，竭誠敬神，這樣的把戲做完以後，媒人便拿所有酒菜，一樣樣的送到新娘口中，隆重　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>在結婚的那大，亦就是苗人所說的「送親日」，男家帶了結婚前準備的禮物，由七個或九個男子伴着，把新郎新娘送回女家。一路由同伴歌唱奏樂，盡情歡笑，將到女家的村旁，就有一二十人，亦唱歌奏樂的歡迎着，同時並有山轎一頂，以備新郎或同伴就坐，坐轎以後，須備三五元的毫幣，以作謝禮。在跑到女家的路上，隨處都架着竹杖或柴草做成的各色棚架，表示歡迎。旣到女家，女家就善爲招待。在那天晚上，男家的送親人及女家的親戚尊長，共同歡宴，席間歌聲應答，杯觥交錯，歡聲雷動。知道東方發白，方始盡興而散。</p>
<p>結婚以後，女子仍留居母家，在留居期間，女子的貞操，是不必顧到，所以往往胎珠暗結，就作爲自己丈夫的孩子。每年只有在節氣及農忙期，回到丈夫家中幾天：直到生了孩子以後，纔經常地和丈夫同居。所以女子的妝奩，亦在生了孩子以後，方始送到夫家。全部結婚過程，到此才告結束。</p>

<p>—你暫借一借我罷，大概他們（指自己的兒子）的爹就得有信來，今年年內我總還你』。</p>
<p>—我看你還是向別人借的好……。阿菊！快做！你看我同別人講話了，你就懶了下來。」</p>
<p>嫂嫂無所措地轉了身，慢步來到小孩邊，坐下喂孩子奶。</p>
<p>王少奶奶裝大了臉，低低地自語着：</p>
<p>—來向我借米，我那裏來多的米，眞是常常來向我………。』</p>
<p>嫂嫂聳起耳朶聽，暗暗地滴下眼淚。</p>
<p>修珍站起身，瘦瘦的像驢子的一條，好似　着無事做。嫂嫂望望她，顯出討厭的樣子：</p>
<p>—妹妹！你來給我看一看這兩個小鬼。本來你回家來住了沒有幾天，不好差動你，實在，你嫂嫂命苦哪，一僩人來不及做許多事。」她剛要離開此地，到屋後面的太公那兒去，碰巧太公剛由後面踱了過來。太公雖然老了，却還鮮健；現在田事和山事都無需他親自下手，早巳託付了三個兒子，更有一般僱農爲他誠實的終日勞作。不過他還會做做小事情，有時編編草鞋，有時縛縛掃帶。</p>
<p>太公與王少奶奶打着招呼，他是來託王少爺打南貨的；王少爺是寗波的某南貨號的經理，託他買是可以打點折扣。太公恰巧要向王少奶奶說明來意之際，嫂嫂却攔住着說：</p>
<p>—太公！我剛要到你那邊去，我要與太公商量點事情。」聲音又低下來。『你再借我二斤米，他們的爹大概就要有信來，今年年底總一定還淸你。」</p>
<p>—借米！我是自己也困難，辛辛苦苦種了幾畝田，都給太陽晒死。收成不好，錢糧却要多納，有了幾顆穀，自己吃還吃不够。」</p>
<p>—太公！就借一借我，今年年底總還你的。我們今天沒有米煮飯，只是這冰得半死的芥菜總不能飽肚的。』她指着面前的一塊小小的菜園。</p>
<p>—你要二升米？」太公望望那小小的園地。「你從前已經借過我一斗；唔……我看……我再給你二斗米……。」</p>
<p>—那頂好，那頂好！多謝太公，太公總究是有福氣的，多良善！」</p>
<p>—可是……你把這菜園押給我。』</p>
<p>—把菜園押給你？」嫂嫂躊躇着，她想這菜園是一年到頭小菜的發源地，有了這菜園不買別的小菜，就只買點鹽和醬油也就可以過去。她腦子輾轉地想着。「太公！你先借我二升米再說，這個事讓我再想一想。」</p>
<p>—不押，由你的，不過向我借，我老早說過我沒多米，就是你押給我，那二斗米也要從穀裏磨出來，不過米多一點，雖然轉個手，也化得來。」</p>
<p>嫂嫂又去問了幾家鄰居，結果還是弄不到米，中午早已到來，孩子們哭嚷着要吃東西。嫂嫂想到，如果丈夫依舊無信息，那末問題不是一餐二餐的事，這個年怎麽過？她慌亂了一陣，决定把菜園押給太公。她一跑跑到太公那兒：</p>
<p>—太公！我看你再給我三斗米罷，這樣我可以吃到新年。」</p>
<p>—給你二斗半怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>—那末！太公！二斗八升，我也不冉多說了。」</p>
<p>嫂嫂去請了一位敎書先生來寫契約，硯台與筆都巳借好。敎書先生寫到日子的時候，就問：</p>
<p>—從那一天起？」</p>
<p>—自然是今天起。』太公說。</p>
<p>嫂嫂急忙說：</p>
<p>—太公！明年正月半起吧！等待芥菜長大了。』</p>
<p>—你說是明年正月半起？那末也好！」</p>
<p>嫂嫂喜歡着，重復地對敎書先生說：</p>
<p>—先生！你這樣寫，明年正月半起。』</p>
<p>太公也俯下頭對敎書先生說</p>
<p>—先生：你這樣寫淸楚，今天先拿二升米，其餘的明年正月半拿。』</p>
<p>—呵！這樣。這……那我押給你做什麼呢，太公！你眞是……。」</p>
<p>—在我並沒有錯，有句老話：「一隻手交錢，一隻手交貨，」而且我不是先給你拿二升米，以前借的一斗我並不向你討。」</p>
<p>敎書先生擱下眼鏡揩一下鬍髭上的鼻涕，有點爲難起來：</p>
<p>—究竟怎麼寫呢？』</p>
<p>—先生！不必寫啦，這樣我是不肯押給他的。』嫂嫂發靑着臉，抱起修珍在安慰的那個哭着的孩子，把奶頭塞進孩子的嘴，一隻手碰命擠着空的奶。</p>
<p>母親早已出來聽到這個消息，她是不贊成把祖宗留傳下來的唯一的地產押給他人。</p>
<p>—我去向忠貴老太太借十四個銅板來，以後她總要呌我念佛的，可以在念佛工錢裏扣。若借得到，就去稱一斤麵頭來。」母親遠遠地走去，孩子們望着她後影依舊哭呌着。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c179">男女同學問題的「再討論」 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 蟄庸</p>
<p>北平袁市長爲了他個人的某種見解，在讀經尊孔等等舉國若狂的復古潮流中，異軍突起，取締平市中學；以一市的行政長官而居然能以其一已的毅力變更敎育制度，實在可驚。嗣後數見報載敎育部對平市男女分校事有所指示，但這指示到底是怎樣的指示，我人至今尙不得其詳。因此這全國最高敎育行政機關對男女同學事究採取何種態度，殊未敢妄加揣測。</p>
<p>不過，男女同學問題，我覺得確實還有値得再加討論的價値。我們從史的方面考察：在封建社會女子僅處於男性的隸屬地位，一般人以爲女人智力低於男子，所以被判定是男子的坃物或應是男子的奴隸，帝王公侯的后妃宮娥屬於上者，庶民的妻妾屬於後者。時代的路綫踏入了資本制度之後，女性爲了時代的覺醒，她們不願再做男子的玩物了，不願再做男子的奴隸了，由是無數郝爾茂們的小鳥兒都飛出了傀儡家庭的牢寵，要求天賦的平等，要求職業的經濟的平等。這時代正當我們的五四時代，於是學校開放女禁了，工商各界均有女職員參與了，政治上也有女官吏在活動了。這一時代從封建的氛圍里衝出來的時侯，雖然也遇有很大的阻力，但這阻力終於抵抗不了那時代的偉力偉力！</p>
<p>男女同學的鬥爭，似乎已在五四時代完畢了，而且確實已使一般人明瞭男女敎育的應當平等了。但二十年之後的今日，重新要我們將那死了的問題從墳墓裏屈出來加以討論，我認爲若因比能重新估定其價値，那也未嘗不是一件好事。</p>
<p>明明的，主張男女分校的先生們的所以不贊成男女同學，是認爲男女同學與風化脊關，並不是爲了男女的性別，將敎育的課程作進一步的更張。</p>
<p>剛脫了封建思想的外衣的男人女人，像初放脚的姑娘，走路往往要感到忸怩不安，同樣的，因爲初期的男女同學學生對異性的觀念，本來是從封建的男女授受不親的神私現象中薰陶出來的，不免要在解放後的男女中多了點糾紛，、不過這還是因爲封建時代把男女問性的知識弄得太神秘了的緣故。我們敢相信，若假以時日，將男女間一切神秘性打破以後，男人與女人還不是同樣的沒有什麽奇怪嗎？證據是有的，倍倍爾在「婦人與社會」一書中說及斯巴達的男女，自幼皆裸體共同遊息，對性的生理一點沒有什麼神秘念頭，却也不見得他們常常會因此引起性慾衝動。所以倍倍爾又在「婦人與智力」的一章里說，男女同學决不會因女性的誘惑而使男生荒廢學業，反之，正因爲相互競爭，爭榮於異性而更加用功更加努力的。試問男女同學與風化又有什麽關係呢？若謂男女在一室內讀書就要引起性慾衝動，那不是笑話嗎？如果說使男女多接近機會，容易引起風化問題，那末學生接觸異性，除在學校課堂內之外，也許有更多機會，這樣，風化的問題便將無法可以阻止了。所以，不從根本上去導引男女去認識</p>
<p>正當的性知識，反而神秘之，封鎖之，這是捨本逐末的辦法，結果非回到封建思想的時代不可！</p>
<p>男女敎育機會是應該平等的，這前提我想不會有人反對的了，但男女分校無異就是在男女敎育機會尙未平等的情况下再加一重阻止平等的鐵鏈。試調查任何學校的男女生比例，從沒有達到等比的地步，甚至女生只是在學校中點綴點綴，要與男生人數一致，還差得很遠很遠，可見實際上的男女敎育機會的平等始終還沒有做到。我們當此過渡時代，只有鼓吹增收女生才是正辦。但在形式上的平等尙未達到之前而分校之令已下，全市僅設有幾所女校，與男校數量相較，相差甚鉅，這實無異判斷女子受敎育的機會的減少。</p>
<p>我說，男女同學的問題是値得再討論的，可是値得再討論的是：關於男女敎育是否應該一致？男女所受課程是否應有一部分的異樣？但不是男女分校的問題。是敎育家心理學家的研究問題，但不是行政官吏所憂慮的風化問題。</p>

<h3 id="c180">肉體與靈魂 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 亞卿</p>
<p>肉體與靈魂，精神和物質之關係的問題，是自有人類社會以來就被討論着的。原始人類因爲沒有一點科學知識，不僅對於一般自然現象不理解，卽對人類自身的生理上和生活上的許多現象也英名其妙。首先是死的事情使他們覺得奇怪。在他們看來，一個活着的人死了的時候，其肉體依然存在，其五官四肢的位置也絲毫沒有變更，但其呼吸却斷絕了，實際上與其活着的時候是根本不同的：這簡直是一件怪事！由此，他們便生出一種假想來：一個人活着的時候，必然是有什麽東西支配着他的身體的，當其死時，那個支配他肉體的東西便離開了他而往別處去了；這個東西被他們稱為靈魂。他們以爲人的肉體不過是一個軀殼，是被靈魂支配的，一旦靈魂他往了，人隨卽死亡，因而其肉體也就沒有了作用；是靈魂規定肉體的存在，不是肉體規定靈魂的存在。於是，原始人類便形成了靈魂不滅的信念。此種信念不僅有人死去時肉體無變動的事實來作說明，而且在他們常在夢中看見已死的人的事實上還有更充分的證據。他們想，一個人旣已死了，其肉體已腐爛了，爲什麼活着的人還能在夢中會着他呢？這不是靈魂不滅的鐵證嗎？</p>
<p>原始人類對於睡眠也抱着同樣不科學的理解。因爲人在睡眠中往往會把其白日的生活情况在夢里再現出來，如原始野蠻人在白日狩獵，追逐野牛，或者與別的人羣戰鬥，這些事情必然也會片斷地在夢中再現着，對此原始人類認爲是靈魂離開肉體的行動，所以他們便確信了靈魂是能離開肉體單獨行動的；如果不是這樣，那麽，何以身體在此睡臥着，並沒有什麽動作，而自己却在野外追逐野牛或和別人交戰呢？</p>
<p>靈魂能離開肉體而獨立存在，並且是永久不滅的：這便是原始人類對於肉體與靈魂之關係這個問題的理解。由於這種理解，便構成了人類的許多迷信觀念和行爲。據拉發格的考察，有許多野蠻人甚至以爲其身體的影子是其靈魂，因而對其影子非常重視。他在其有名的「思想起源論」中說：「愛圭特（Epuateu）的野蠻人，當正午時，因爲身體沒有影子，他們就不出他們的矮屋，害怕失掉他們的靈魂，以至於死。希臘人也有向樣觀念。他們相信那些穿過里塞山熱斯神殿的人和獸，都會失掉他的影子而歸於死亡。一個人在淸澈的水里或在光滑的平面上所映起的像，是他的靈魂的像，如果打了牠，便會傷了靈魂。拉爾西斯（Narciase）的古代逸事，和中世紀之妖術的蠟像呪，大概都是連繫於這個信仰的。假使取開和搬移一個人的畫像，就算是奪去他的靈魂。爲了這個理由，野蠻人拒絕畫像。」事實上，不僅野蠻人中有如此的現象，就在我們的社會中也可以隨處看到「靈魂不滅」這種信念的發展。如爲死人念經，追薦亡魂，如大出喪，敬奉祖宗，以及信鬼敬神等迷信現象，不都是由「靈魂不滅」這個信念中發展出來的嗎？</p>
<p>但是，隨着社會和人類知識的發展，人類對於一切自然現象和人生現象已日益有了較科學的理解了。如自然界的現象，只不過是化學的，物理的法則的變化之實體，並沒有什麽上帝在那里主</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>宰；人類生活過程中的一切現象，如疾病死亡，如夢幻等，也只有在社會學和生理學中才能找到正確的說明，「靈魂不滅論」在此是沒有用處的。——這些都是自十八九世紀科學昌明以來就爲人類所知道了的。不過，就在科學已經右了相當發達的時代，在人類社會中，對於肉體與靈魂之關係這問題的理解，除有些人還抱着原始的「靈魂不滅」的信今外，更還有些號稱爲科學家思想家的人們是抱着機械論的觀點的；此種觀點雖然較「靈魂不滅論」進步，但依然是錯誤的，所以　須加以　　。</p>
<p>依機械論者看來，一個人，好像一架能運動的機器一樣；除了有一個機械似的肉體外，其他什麽都沒有。因此，什麽靈魂，精力，精神，在他們看來根本是不存在的，因而在人類生活過程中也是沒有任何作用的。不錯，像野蠻人所理解的那樣離開肉體而獨立的靈魂是不存在的，但是，如我們把「靈魂」當作「精力」或「精神」來理解，那牠却又是存在的。，只不過這樣的靈魂並非孤立地存在着，而是依存於肉體的；是肉體規定靈魂的存在，不是靈魂規定肉體的存在。</p>
<p>隨着社會的發展，人類的精力也在日益發展中。現在，人類的智力，創造力都較原始人的要高若干倍；人們總當承認二十世紀的人與原始時代的人雖同樣是人類，但他們的智慧，精力，靈魂却不是一樣的：前者的比後者的要高得多。由此我們就無法否認「靈魂」或「精神」的存在及其作用，不過，這存在是依附於肉體的罷了。再拿個人來說，一個人不僅有一個肉體，而且有其精神，靈魂；最後說來，這精神，這靈魂，自然是依存於肉體的，但一個向上或墮落的靈魂對於一個人的生活乃至對於整個社會也有一定的反作用。事實上，在我們的社會中，就有不少的人爲了要住洋房，喫大菜，玩女人，作種種的濫費，使其肉身沉溺於驕奢淫逸的深淵中，竟不惜專門去獻媚逢迎，造謠作僞，賣己害人。像這樣的人，其靈魂當然是墮落了的，甚至可說是沒有靈魂的行尸走肉，其對於人類社會當然要起危害作用；反之，另有一種人則是始終對眞理負責任，「富貴不能移，威武不能屈」，從不說連自己都認爲不對的話，從不做連自己都認爲不對的事情：此種人始可稱之爲具有偉大的靈魂的人物，其對於人類社會當然也是起着推進作用的。我以爲在此「世風日下」，「道德淪亡」，「信義破產」的情况下，每一個人，特別是靑年人，都須注意保持自身的純潔偉大的靈魂，恥與行尸走肉爲伍！</p>
<p>不過，我也並不是要大家絲毫不注意物質生話，不去求自己生活上必需的物質來維持肉身的存在，而去空談「偉犬的靈魂」；不，那是玄而又玄的高調，甚至可說是原始似的迷信觀念的發展，我們並不作那樣的主張。我們以爲維持生活与保持个人的偉大的靈魂並不衝突，只要你沒有過高的物質欲望。自然，人總是想自己的物質生活一天一天地變好，但重視自己的人格，對客觀真理認識得很淸楚的人，他便不是只想共個人生活日益好起來，他主要地是努力使一般社會的物質生活日益好起來；因此，在緊急關頭的時候，他便寗可犧牲其肉體，不願出賣其靈魂以危害人類社會：這便是我們所讃揚的有偉大靈魂的人物，此種人物是我們所當而且所能做的</p>

<p>在冬季，那河水是全乾的，可是在春季下雨之後，四山溪水都匯入此河，於是河水便告滿盈。河寬約一里餘，兩岸怪石猙獰，有的像是臥着蹲着，有的排立岸邊狀如拱衛，有的是中流砥柱如一夫當關然，有的橫臥河心，急流衝到那裏，便發出那弱者反抗的呼聲。河水碧綠地滾滾地東流，襯着四圍靑葱的高山，巍然獨峙高揷雲霄的山峯，這樣的美景，决計不是別處的人所能領略得到的。我們常在那裏徘徊着，豪放地唱出「美哉中華」的歌兒，不是太陽來催促我們，决不想離開那兒。</p>
<p>我曾痴心想過，在那裏結一草廬，終朝地徜徉在河邊，可以儘量地讀古人書，可以悲壯地發出內心的歌聲，可以淸靜地避開人世間的煩惱，可以優哉游哉，與世無爭地過着逍遙的日子，日出而作，日入而息，過那原始人的生活，但是，這是做夢也决不能辦到的事情，這一擔重負决不讓我偷懶稍卸仔肩的。不過我又想，一般達官貴人，要是　到這樣好的景緻，也許會生出「我將入山從赤松子遊」的觀念，而生靈也可以少受塗炭了吧。</p>
<p>那彭因河有英國人建築的大鐵索橋，橋長二十餘丈，寬八尺。那鐵索是許多的細鐵絲絞扭起來，便成一條像頭一般粗細的鐵繩。那鐵繩總計有六條，二條架在橋頂，四條放在橋底，那鐵繩二端便深埋在二岸土石中　然後用水板一塊一塊的平舖在底面的四根鐵繩上，兩邊上下以指頭般粗細的鐵條連繫起來，用釘將鐵條與木板釘住，這樣便成功一頂鐵索橋了。這鐵索橋比繩橋堅固得多，比溜橋更便利得多，因此在那裏的橋用鐵索建築的很多</p>
<p>過彭因河沒有多遠，大概有五里路吧，便是一個村莊。那裏都是野人，他們大都是肩上掛着刀矛等武器，身上背着篾籮，用以裝運東西，穿的是花布的短衣，下身有的穿褲，有的圍着一條裙子。女人亦是背着篾籮，短衣長裙，耳朶上都帶着琥珀耳柱或是銷圈二對。男的女的老的少的都嗜嚼生煆草，她們以口紅爲美，因此誰都是生着血盆似的嘴巴。有一次當我們走近他們的時候，他們和她們都露出驚奇的目光來注視我們。</p>
<p>「呵！這般人是那裏來的呀？」他們　哩咕嚕地在操着土語。我祗瞠目對他們望着。我們中間有一個同伴是懂得他們的話的，便回答他們：「我們是來玩的，同時我們還打算送一點東西給你們，做一個見面禮。」他說着便取出我們所特備的針，錦，土布，老布，烟草等物，贈送他們每人一份。</p>
<p>當他們談話的時候，太陽祇剩一綫光明，我於是拉開了鏡　，想利用機會來照一張照相，可是她們突然地都逃走了，那一種驚慌的狀態眞像是給她發現了敵人或是遇到了吃人的虎豹一樣。</p>
<p>「這是要攝人靈魂的東西呀，你們都是天朝的大官，怎麽作這樣不法的事情？「他們操着土語，跟我們一個同伴辦交涉。</p>
<p>「不，我們不是大官，這是拍照相。你要是照過之後，這裏面便有一張紙會把你的形狀在那紙上顯出來。一我的同伴說。</p>
<p>無論你怎樣解釋，他　總是不允許我們給他們攝影。不一會，太陽已經躱到雲端裏去了，這千載一時的機會終於這樣地失掉了。</p>
<p>在這一個村莊裏只有一家是漢人，有一爿專做雜物賣買的小店，也是他們開設的。在這樣偏僻的地方，在千萬野人中間，竟發現幾個漢人，這是何等高興的事呀！他們呢，差不多巳和野人同化了，只不過因爲祖上傳說下來，說他們是漢人，因此他們始終不承認是土人，而說他們是漢人。他們只知道是明朝時候遷居在那裏，那時候是有皇帝的，因此他們也曾問我們：「現在是　麽朝代了？什麽人坐着江山　？」我們詳細地跟他們說，可是他們只是像聽故事一樣地聽着，他們不相信中國是沒有皇帝的。最後他痛哭着，說他們因失了祖國的保護而受侵凌。當他們痛哭的時候，我們也是同樣欷歔着，悲念祖國的命運。</p>
<p>他們不知道春夏秋冬，祗知道野花開了，那便是春，太陽像火傘一樣的時候，便是夏，穀米收成的時候，便是秋，白雪在天空飄揚的時候，便是冬，在新米上塲的第一天，便算是元且日。</p>
<p>更有一次，我們到一家土人家裏去玩，他們燈火輝煌地正在慶祝新年，桌上排列着不少的肴　，有魚，獸肉等。當我們走進他們家裏的時候，他們非常歡迎我們，他們在新年裏碰到一個漢人，認爲是非常有興的事。坐定之後，便喝他們自製的白酒，那味兒决不是別的地方所能買到的。</p>
<p>酒半酣，主人便站起來演娩，那樣子像是非常嚴重。他的兒子，女兒，孫子，孫女，都　首靜聽着。我祗是呆望着，不知道他說的是怎樣的一段故事，後來由我們的同伴翻譯給我們聽，纔知道他是這樣的說。。</p>
<p>「你們聽着！我們從前都是孟獲的子孫，那年　諸葛武　南征，孟獲失敗被擒，多虧武侯不殺，始有今日。所以我們感謝武侯，更應該感謝漢人，因爲武侯就是漢人。我們世受漢恩，所以今後我們應該記着，漢朝是我們的恩人。」</p>
<p>他們這樣世世相傳地，每逢元旦日便由家主來詔示子孫，因此，他們至今仍牢記着中國，即使在帝國主義者宰割之下，也還是不忘中國。</p>
<p>據我們的同伴說：「那裏都是崇山峻嶺，所以土人都以種山田爲生，其栽培法是聽其自生自實。要是能够敎以種植的方法，那末，牠的收成决不會只有這一些的。因爲生活還能够過得去，這樣，便養成了偷懶的習慣。那裏其他的出產有獸皮，麝香，鹿茸，漆，藥材，芝蔴等類；那裏還產茶，味濃厚，可惜現已無人過問。那地上出產的是那樣地豐富，至於地下的那是更可觀了，要是一經開發，那必定是有非常驚人的發展的。至於土人的一切習俗，却跟漢族差不多。」</p>
<p>業餘修學</p>
<h3 id="c182">業餘進修問題芻議 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 黃沉</p>
<p>我想假使是個進步的職業者，無論是工商界中任何一等人，或上至廠長經理，或下至工人學徒，他們都會感到自己智識不够之苦，其重要原因不外有五：一·在求學的時期中因家境貧苦或因經濟狀况的突變，中途輟學而不得不走上職業的途徑；二·因爲在求學的時期努力程度的不够，使他對智識的獲得並不充實；三·因爲在求學的時睽並不曾肯定自己將來的出路，以致學非所用；四·因爲職業典趣的關係，並其他不得已的原因，中途改業，以至對於新職業的智識威到非常的缺乏；五·因爲入職業界久，缺乏進修的機會，或進修而沒有好的指導，以致感到智識的恐慌。</p>
<p>職業者們都急切的需要着有進修的機會，理由是：一方面可以解除上述智識慾的飢餓，一方面可將所獲知識之成果補救業務之缺陷，進而求業務之精進。然而事實上對於這種職業者的願望，是否能確切地使他們滿足呢？不消說，這是非常可憐的。當然，政府對於近日工商業的凋敝，以表面救濟猶虞力所不繼，决不會再想到政治者所認爲較小的問題如工商業者的業餘進修諸事了。敎育家，對於這般職業者，卽從前敎育家的生徒，也如嫁出的女兒潑出的水，不再加以注意或過問了。於是蚩蚩者氓在數年之後往往會落伍於後來的競爭者中，這不僅是一個國家人才陶冶的奢侈浪費，也就是不能與他國競爭勝利的最大障礙。</p>
<p>有人說，創業固難，守業尤難，我也說，人才造就不易，而已造就的人才使之不腐化尤不易，所以我敢大聲疾呼的提出「促進業餘進修」「廣謀職業者的進修機會」的意見和具體辦法於社會人士之前：</p>
<p>一　建設大規模的業餘圖書館</p>
<p>進修雖不限於書本，但吾人可肯定書本確爲先覺者由研究或經騐積聚的成果，學問雖可由行而後知，但知而後行，或一面知一面行，也未嘗非我們時間寶貴的職業者的一個較便捷的辦法。可是，大多數職業者本身的經濟能力非常單薄，不要說養家的能力有限，甚且養己的能力也靠不住。叫他怎能再負購書的債務呢？於是我們不能不將這種責任交之於社會的公共圖書館中了。但現狀下的公共圖書館，除窮鄉僻壤少有設備外，卽城市中也大多簡陋異常，或過於專門（如專注重社會科學或文學部門），或過於偏重低級趣味（如陳列刋登各種女人照片的圖畫雜誌是），大都不適於廣大的職業者們的閱讀。</p>
<p>我認爲較標準的業餘圖書館，圖書除基本項目外，應廣列各種職業部門，由淺近以至高深，以進階式的編列，供智識程度高下不等及理論的或技能的多方面的適應。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>這自然是較爲費事的工作，然我敢說，若不能做到這幾點，這圖書館還是不能普遍地供一般職業者的不同的需要的。</p>
<p>二　開放大學講座</p>
<p>現在無論中外，大學的講座似乎大多是特殊階層的專利品，形式上好像是一位高傲的貴婦，一般平民雖有一親芳澤的慾念而不可得。這種制度是否有修正的必要呢？我認爲很値得討論。學術的本身誠然是高尙的，但學術的施用却應該愈大衆化愈好，學術不能僅供少數資產者御用，應該趨向於大衆的靈魂去。聽說英之劍橋已有這種風氣，有幾門功課可供業餘者專門選擇聽講。這是一種可以仿效的良法，我主張開放各大學所有講座，讓志在高深研究的職業者們自由研習。我想這般自由研究者，他們不爲文憑而來，他們也許會比以進大學爲混歲月當寄宿舍的大學生所得的效　要好些。</p>
<p>三　創設業餘進修指導所</p>
<p>現有的類於指導性質的「信箱」「顧問」等等，大多範圍狹隘，囿於普通常識的圈子，實不够應具有各種不同需要的職業者們的欲求，故我主張創設一完善的業餘進修指導所，不但指導如何進修的方法，並且有解釋疑難的責任，指導人員應廣徵海內學術家和事業家負責祖任，爲便利起見，可附設於著名大學內或著名業餘圖書館中。</p>
<p>上列三端，爲謀一般職業者進修及充實工商業者知能並發展業務起見，實爲刻不容緩之要圖。然茲事體大，若能因拋磚而引玉，使社會和政府咸能注意及此，則此文之作或爲不虛矣！</p>

<h3 id="c183">談滑稽 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 澤</p>
<p>滑稽二宇並不是現在才流行，而是古巳有之，如東方朔淳于髡便是在古書上被稱爲「滑稽之輩」的。但是過去的所謂滑稽，與現在的似有不同：如東方朔淳于髡等滑稽前輩，乃是專以反說詭辯或譬喻的說辭去諫「人主」難士人的，現在的所謂滑稽，則有使人輕快發笑的意味。依現刻的一般對於滑稽的解釋，則它是旣與莊嚴鄭重相反，又不能使人發生悲壯憤慨的感懷；牠所給與人的感覺是輕鬆暢快。亞里士多德在其「詩學」中曾說「滑稽是不含苦痛或災禍的缺德或醜惡」，這雖是古代希臘的哲人的話，但其中也包含的有現在的我們所認可的這個意義：滑稽是與莊嚴鄭重相反而能使人發笑的。</p>
<p>構成各種滑稽的，多半是些不甚重要的人間的細小事情。據一般的考察，滑稽大概可以分成這幾大類；第一，過分反常的奇形怪狀的人物所具有的滑稽，如上海城隍廟的小頭人，如體重七百餘磅的世界第一大胖子，如不滿兩尺高的矮人，便是一見就會令人捧腹的滑稽事情。第二，由太不調和太不相稱的事情所櫛成的滑稽，如「紅樓夢」所描寫的劉姥姥進大觀園的不調和的表情，中國舊劇中的大面假扮女角的事情，便是這一類的滑稽的例證。第三，出人意外的反常的事情所具有的滑糟：譬如，假使現在有一位摩登靑年與一個完全是過去的鄕村裝束的小脚女人拉着手在南京路散步，那情形恐怕無論怎樣鎭靜的人見到之後也要笑痛肚子的吧；又如大家所知道的被稱爲「一對現世寶」的勞來與哈台，便是常常在銀幕上幹着出人意料之外的種種笨事來引一般觀衆的笑的，因此他倆才成爲了滑稽明星：這兩者便是這一類的滑稽的具體說明</p>
<p>至於我們在談話和作文中所表現出的滑稽，一般說來大概都包含的有這兩種意味中的一種：一，能刺激人的性的感覺的，二，具有諷刺意味的。因爲每一個人都有性的本能，都有滿足性慾的要求，所以在男女兩性的關係上最容易構成滑稽可笑的話語和故事。在鄉村中和一般勞動者中，這類滑稽有趣的故事最流行。至於具有諷刺意味的滑稽，則在一般演說家雄辯家的言辭中，在有些文學作家的作品中，都可找到很好的實例。譬如果戈爾的「兩個伊凡的爭吵」與「巡按」，吳敬梓的「儒林外史」，李伯元的「官塲現形記」，便都是具有辛辣的諷刺意味興夫滑稽可笑的情調的。現在，我們且隨便引一段「儒林外史」上的文字來作參考吧！</p>
<p>「……兩人（張靜齋及范進）進來，先是靜齋謁過，范進上來叙師生之禮。湯知縣再三謙讓，奉坐喫茶。同靜齋叙了些闊別的話；又把范進的文章稱贊了一番，問道「因何不去會試？」范進方才說道，「先母見背，遵制丁憂。」湯知縣大驚，忙呌換了吉服。拱進後堂，擺上酒來。……知縣安了席坐下，用的都是銀鑲杯箸。范進退前縮後的不舉杯箸，知縣不解其故。靜齋笑道，「世先生因遵制，想是不用這個杯箸。」知縣忙呌換去。換了一個磁杯，一雙象牙箸來，范進又不肯舉動。靜齋道「這個箸也不用。」隨即換了一雙白顏色竹子的來，方才罷了。知縣疑惑：「他居喪如此盡禮，倘或不用葷酒，却是不曾備辦。」落後看見他在燕窩碗里揀了一個大蝦圓子送在嘴里，方才放心。……」</p>
<p>這里所表現出的，不僅滑稽可笑，而且是含有辛辣的諷刺意味的。</p>
<p>因爲滑稽能使人輕鬆發笑，而且在一般言辭中所包含的，又往往包含的有諷刺意味，所以在我們的談話中，在我們的文章中，如善於應用滑稽的諷刺語，善於表現帶着諷刺味的滑稽的事情，那是能發生意想不到的效力的。然而這却是頗不容易做得好的事情。首先我們須得知道滑稽的客觀意義。即是要看一句話一件事情是否滑稽，主要的要由你的聽衆和讀者來决定，不能全憑你的主觀的獨斷；必須要你主觀所認爲的滑稽和客觀所認爲的滑稽相合，更具體地說，即必須你認爲可笑的，你的聽衆或讀者也覺得可笑，才能發生效力，否則便會引起人的討厭。我們在一般談天吹牛中，就常見到有些並不活潑並不懂得滑稽的人，裝起他那活潑滑稽的樣子，大講其滑稽笑話，但結果除他一個人哈哈大笑外，別的人不僅不笑，而且悶着氣，覺得有些煞風景。如像這樣的主觀的滑稽與客觀的滑稽的不一致的表現，結果不僅不能發生滑稽的效力，而且還顯示出了那「滑稽家」的寶器。復次，滑糟的表現還應該力避下流和輕薄，就是說，滑稽應該有深刻的社會意義，不應以無聊的低級的事情來構成滑稽。要這樣的滑稽才能發生有意義的諷刺的效能，才有益於自身和人類社會，否則不僅會使自己丑角化，爲人所輕視玩弄，而且還會把許多嚴重問題遊戲化，使眞理不能露面。</p>
<p>同時，滑稽的表現也應該是有限度的，不能隨時隨地都滑稽。因爲不管怎樣，就是帶有很大的諷刺性的滑稽吧，也是不大鄭重的，因而也是有礙於問題之正式解决的。你想，假使無論對什麼事情，如別人家里死了人，如在國家危亡的時候你也只是去諷刺，去表現滑稽，那不是太豈有此理了嗎！我以爲只有那些厭倦了物質生活的貴婦人才專門追求滑稽趣味，以消磨悠長的歲月；只有那些專門靠實婦人奧飯的丑角才專門去講求滑稽，研究滑稽；一般認眞生活的人，即使要講點滑稽話，說點滑稽事情，也是有限度的，而且是有意一義的。</p>

<h3 id="c184">托爾斯泰的人道主義 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>托爾斯泰不僅是聞名世界的大文豪，且是最有名的人道主義者。因爲在他底人道主義的說敎中包含着很多的眞理，因爲他有偉大的藝術才能，所以其人道主義的影響與其諸著作底價値都是很大的。</p>
<p>首先，値得我們注意的，是他底有名的「藝術論」。我以爲這本著作底價値是在別的許多「藝術概論」的書籍之上的。在這中間，托爾斯泰曾提出了許多爲我們底「新的」文藝研究者所不曾想到的主張，曾說了許多爲現在的許多「新人物」不敢說的話。他曾以痛烈的言辭反對了各種觀念論的藝術觀，他曾大膽地指出了上等人物底生活和藝術之虛偽，他努力讚揚一般勤勞大衆底生活和藝術，表現出了他底公正的愛護眞理的熱誠態度。但是我們應該明白，托爾斯泰是從基督敎的立塲，從人道主義的立塲來發表他底一切意見的。他在駁斥了觀念論的理論之後，在痛烈地非難了上等人底生活和藝術之後，便明白地提出了由宗敎思想决定藝術價値的主張。他說：</p>
<p>「藝術特性（就是它所傳的感情）的估價緊於人對於人生意義的了解及所見人生的有幸福與否。人生的有幸福與否全由宗敎以决定。」</p>
<p>在這樣的宗敎的藝術觀之下，他又把他底「不抵抗惡」的敎義與藝術結合起來。若依他的說法，那便赴那能使被迫害的人愛護其迫害者的作品才能算是最偉大的。他說：</p>
<p>「高尙的藝術品不是戰勝的廟宇，塑着戰勝者的像，却是創造在愛裏的人類心靈的描寫，能使受刧被殺的人憐惜並且愛他底虐主。」</p>
<p>這樣，托爾斯泰對於被迫害的人們雖是極表同情，雖是很「人道」的，但結果他却是要使「受刧被殺的人憐惜並且愛他底虐主」，以保存「虐主」們底地位</p>
<p>十九世紀後半的俄羅斯，正是沒落的土地貴族以各種殘酷的方法對付俄國一般民衆來維持其統治的時候，托爾斯泰就在這時提出了「不抵抗惡」的主張，他底理由是：「因爲火不能以火滅，水不能以水乾，惡亦不能以惡斷根的」。但是，如果眞的這樣，那當時俄羅斯底土地貴族底一切惡行便會遭不到反抗，其存在地位也就不會發生問題了。由此我們可以說：托爾斯泰底敎義，他底藝術觀，他底人道主義，都是當時俄羅斯底某一部分土地貴族底意識的反映。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰底許多文學作品，不消說也是在他那樣的藝術觀，那樣的人道主義之下寫成的。因此，他底文學作品所表現的中心意識，在根本上也是一部分土地貴族的意識。不錯，宗敎家，人道主義者托爾斯泰是偉大的寫實主義的作家，在其許多文學創作中曾以寫實主義的描寫法則無情地暴露了地主貴族們底墮落生活和惡行：如在「上帝王國在我們之中」便無情地表露了知事壓迫農民的殘忍的事情，在「我們如何生活」之中也眞實地表明了上等人物底娛樂與民衆痛苦底密切關係，在「我不能沉默」中更描寫了以死刑對付農民者之殘忍……。但是，他是從地主貴族們底道德罪惡</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>來說明這些事情，並未實際地去描寫；他不主張「受刦被殺的人」反抗其「虐主」，反而是叫他們去「憐惜並且愛」他們底「虐主」，希望那些「虐主」們——地主貴族改惡爲善。他底這樣的努力，「不外是最狡猾的，因而最應厭惡的僧侶主義的培養」。</p>
<p>由於資本主義的發展，十九世紀之末的俄羅斯底農村遭到了不能抵禦的破壤。在這破壞中，不僅是地主貴族們感到不安，卽一般農民底生活苦痛也日益深刻化着。於是，在無形中，在反對都市資本主義一點上，農民與一部分地主便站在同一戰綫了。於是，人道主義者托爾斯泰在其作品中也就反映了地主農民們底那種意識，仇視都市，反對資本主義，讚美素樸的農村。——就這一點看來，也可見到托爾斯泰底世界觀，他底人道主義，是貴族性的。</p>

<p>專述</p>
<h3 id="c185">華僑在全世界（五） <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>緬甸</p>
<p>緬甸東界暹羅，位於我國雲南川邊的南部。在這里的華僑約有三十萬左右，其中大部分都是熟練工人商人與苦力。自一八九五年英國併吞緬甸以後，華僑在緬甸的勢力卽大受打擊，但直到歐戰發生時，緬甸的華僑勢力都是在日益發展的。他們在仰光等地經商做工，每年都可獲得若干錢財，其中有許多人是已經成爲了富翁。同時，緬甸華僑除了經營其個人的事業外，還努力創辦學校和報紙，以發展華僑敎育與文化。但自歐戰爆發後，情勢就日益和前不同了。一則由於英國煽惑緬人排斥華僑，使我在緬僑胞大受打擊；再則是因爲印度齊智（印度的錢莊）勢力日益在緬甸發　展，使華僑中的下級商人反要賴以維持生計，實際上華僑在緬固有的地位已被齊智取而代之了；同時，歐美各國的金融勢力也日益深入了緬甸，現今在仰光已有七個國家的銀行，共有十餘家之多，其資本都很雄厚，組織也較完善，但屬於中國籍的在仰光的銀行却只有一家，而且資本亦不甚雄厚，在營業上當然也就不能與他人競爭。這樣，緬甸的金融旣在外人掌握之中，工商業也不能與別人競爭，同時又受緬人的公開排斥，華僑在緬甸的勢力又怎麼不會日益衰落呢？</p>
<p>越南</p>
<p>越南在中國的南部，與粤桂滇等省相連接，我們通常叫它做安南，外人名之爲法屬印度支那。遠在秦漢時代，越南卽曾爲中國內領；元明淸三代亦奉中國爲宗主。直到一八八五年中法條約簽定，越南才由中國的領十變爲法國的屬地了。這里所有的華僑究竟有多少，直到現在尙無確切的統計：有的說是四十萬，有的說是六十萬，有的則說是在百萬以上；但不管怎樣，在越南的華僑人數至少是有七八十萬的。其中多半是廣東和福建人，一九零六年十月十六日法政府爲求其統治便利起見，依據籍貫語言之異同將南圻華僑分爲五幫，分五區居住。所謂五帮者，卽廣州，福建，海南，潮州及客家是也。</p>
<p>廣州人在越南者多半是從事於工商業。在西貢等地的米店，木店，布店，磚瓦製造，石灰製造，毛皮獸骨等業皆爲廣東人所經營，此外如木匠，石匠，裁縫，靴工以及屠戶等亦多係廣東人所擔任。福建人在此地的人數雖然較少，但其在工商業方面的勢力却很大。在堤岸等地的工廠和米店大都爲他們所開設。據調查，西貢有碾米廠三十餘家，其中華僑所經營者竟佔二十八九家之多，而福建人却在此二十八九家中佔最大多數。客家華僑亦多在西貢和堤岸各地，其所經營者主要是茶業；越南茶業幾爲其所獨佔。至於潮州人，則多半是在此地作船夫和苦力，其其西部諾省者，亦多有從事農業的。</p>
<p>在法國未併呑越南以前，華僑在越南頗受優待；華人赴越亦極便利。近來法人對於越南華僑加以種種苛捐雜稅，雖苦力小販亦不能免。至於傘人赴越，更是多方爲難：入口時不僅要檢查身體，打印指模，而且還要繳納入口稅若干，身稅若于；若被認爲稍有不合，卽不許登岸，就是登岸後隨時亦有被其驅逐出境的危險。因此，越南華僑也和其他各地的華僑的命運相同：是在日益衰落中的。</p>
<p>菲律賓</p>
<p>菲律賓是與我國的閩粤兩省隔海相望的一個大島，面積爲十二萬方哩，人口有一千一百萬。遠在周秦時代，菲律賓與中國何已經有往來了。菲律賓人右許多是中國人的混血種，其農具，其風俗習慣，乃至其名稱之發音，有許多都是與中國相同的：這些事實，都可以充分證明中國與菲律賓關係之密切。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Various Hubei Government Conferences Decide on Flood Control Plans; Dredging the Yangtze River to be Overseen by the Water Conservancy Association; Dredging the Xiang River to be Designed by the Engineering Bureau; River Waters Continue to Recede, Wuhan Dyke Out of Danger <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Various government agencies held two meetings yesterday and today to discuss river dredging and dyke construction, deciding on five measures. Dredging of the Yangtze River will be overseen by the Water Conservancy Association; dredging of the Xiang River will be designed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau; investigations into dykes and embankments, as well as repairs, relief for refugees through work, and conscription of labor, will all have implementation measures determined. It is reported that the Jianghan Bureau has received orders to repair breached dykes and has scheduled construction to begin before the 15th, and has requested 2 million [dollars] to repair the Wuhan dykes. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded to 45.8 on the 3rd, a total drop of 5.7 feet. The Wuhan Dyke is out of danger and has been taken over by the Jianghan Bureau. Due to the slow receding of water in various counties, it will be difficult to replant autumn crops. Cheng Qibao and Li Shucheng telegraphed Zhang Qun separately, stating that it would be best to allocate relief funds quickly. The Wuhan Expanded Fundraising Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in Hankou on the 4th. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hubei Construction Department, upon the order of the Provincial Government, convened the Civil Affairs Department, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the Flood Relief Association, and other agencies on the 2nd and 3rd to discuss the two issues of dredging rivers and repairing dykes and dams, in order to submit a report to Chairman Chiang for review and instructions. Three principles were decided: (1) Dredging of the Yangtze River will be handled comprehensively by the Water Conservancy Commission. (2) Dredging of the silted Xiang River will be undertaken by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the Construction Department in consultation to formulate a concrete action plan. (3) Breached dykes will be repaired with work-for-relief programs, and detailed plans will be made after the relief funds arrive. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Gucheng Suffers Another Flood Disaster <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Xiangyang, Zhang Qun reported that Gucheng suffered another flood disaster. On the morning of the 1st, the Nan River rose by more than 1 zhang (approx. 10 feet) within one hour. Replanted autumn crops in areas where the water had receded on both banks were almost completely submerged. The floodwaters once again reached the city walls, threatening to enter the city. The county magistrate and garrison troops are blocking the city gates, collecting civilian boats in preparation for flood prevention and rescue. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Hutuo River Surges; Raoyang Embankment Breached <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hutuo River in the middle reaches surged by six feet. A section of the embankment in Raoyang County, which had not been repaired for many years, finally breached on the 2nd, causing widespread flooding. More than 40 villages, including Liuge Dian and Genggezhuang, have become a watery expanse. The rushing torrents have also flooded more than 20 villages in the neighboring Xian County, causing severe disaster. Within Quzhou territory, the Fu River is overflowing and continuing to rise, creating a dangerous situation. Several thousand residents in more than a hundred villages on both banks are desperately working day and night to reinforce the embankments. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 3rd, the water level at the Yongding River's Zhegou Bridge and Huilong Temple was 60.89 meters, an increase of 1.2 centimeters from the previous day. The water level in the middle reaches of Qujiadian on the 3rd was 50.94 meters, and the flow rate remained rapid. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fengpei County Magistrate Supervises Emergency Dyke Reinforcement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Special Commissioner's Office received a telegram from Pei County stating that the breach in Yutai had caused water to flow to Gaozhuang, putting the new dyke in a critical state. Shao Hanyuan went to Pei County this morning to supervise and coordinate with the Pei County Magistrate in leading the laborers to reinforce the dyke. A telegram from Feng County stated that the eastern branch of the Yi River in the second district of northern Feng County was facing a backflow from the lake, threatening to breach. Feng County Magistrate Wang Shuxian rushed to the dyke to supervise the inspection and reinforcement of the river dyke. The northern parts of Feng and Pei counties remain in a critical situation. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Hanzhuang Water Station reported that the water level at the lake outlet is currently 32.145 meters, and the water level in the Grand Canal is 32.077 meters. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Yu Shufang went to Gaozhuang, north of Pei County, yesterday to survey the flood situation and returned to Xuzhou in the evening. According to him, the speed of the water entering Fengpei after the breach is still slow. It is said that the water level has dropped in western Shandong after the dyke breach caused flooding, indicating that there is no large flow coming from upstream. Fengpei may be able to avoid danger, but without plugging the breach at Linpu Settlement, there is no certainty for northern Jiangsu. Yu is going to Nanjing tonight to attend the Economic Commission meeting and will return to Xuzhou after the meeting. The Shandong Construction Department dispatched engineer Liu Mengjiu to Xuzhou on the 3rd to inspect the Shuangzha and Linjiaba at the lake outlet to understand the impact of the slightly lower water washing downstream. He is scheduled to go to Pei County on the 4th to inspect the new dyke before going to Beijing to attend the Economic Commission meeting. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Honglie, accompanied by Wang Shaochang, took a boat from Jining along the Grand Canal to Nanyang Lake today to inspect the situation. The water situation was very serious. They returned to Jining in the evening and transferred to Yanzhou. They are scheduled to go to Beijing on the 4th to attend the Economic Commission meeting on behalf of Han Fuqu. The water level of Weishan Lake has reached the level of the embankment. If there is a strong wind, it will overflow immediately, and the water will inevitably return to the old course of the Yellow River. Jinxiang and Yutai counties are currently rushing to reinforce the embankment. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) In the Quanzhou flood disaster, it is known that over a hundred people have died or been injured, and tens of thousands of people have been affected.

<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu telegraphed Kong Xiangxi today, stating that 5 million disaster victims have no way to appeal and are weeping and pleading, requesting that passports be issued so that they can seek food elsewhere, mostly with Nanjing as their destination. Although they have been persuaded with tactful words, they are willing to take risks. It is hoped that a large sum of money will be quickly raised to save the dying and support the living, so that aiding Shandong is the same as securing Beijing, and relieving the disaster is the same as governing the interior. He also telegraphed Xu Shiying, stating that the losses in the disaster area reached 105 million yuan. He also telegraphed Lin, Jiang, and Wang, requesting that the Ministry of Railways be ordered to repair a light railway from Lanfeng to the breach point, and that the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways be ordered to allocate two special trains to transport materials for plugging the breach. The China International Famine Relief Commission plans to go to the disaster area to distribute 100,000 yuan in relief. The Provincial Executive Committee telegraphed overseas Chinese compatriots, urging them to donate to disaster relief. The Hong Kong Daozi Society dispatched Ms. Huang Hengjie and three others to Jinan to purchase 4,000 bags of flour for relief. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A large number of bandits have recently been lurking in the Dongbazhen area in the eastern suburbs of Beiping, constantly raiding travelers and residents, and their momentum is very rampant. The gentry and elders of the town have specially come to Beiping to submit a petition to the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, requesting that troops and police be dispatched to garrison the town. This has been approved. At present, shops and households in the town close their gates tightly at 7:00 PM every night, and soldiers and police patrol at any time. However, in the areas near the town outside of it, due to the lack of troops and police to suppress them, the bandit forces are still rampant, and residents with slightly more wealth are moving their whole families into the town to avoid the bandits.

<p>(Tianjin) It has been proven that the bandits disturbing the Xifengkou and Qian'an areas are remnants of Liu Guitang's troops, commanded by Bai Jianwu and Lin Yulin. They plan to sneak through various passes, claim to have 4,000 men, and carry the flags of the puppet North China Autonomous National Salvation Army in an attempt to disrupt the war zone, also claiming to have obtained the consent of the Japanese side. The Kawakishi Brigade Commander in Gubeikou dispatched staff officer Harada to declare to Huo Shisheng, the Director of the Gubeikou-Jimi Special Commissioner's Office, that the Kwantung Army Headquarters and the North China Garrison Army Headquarters had not been involved in this matter. If the name of the Japanese army is used, or the name cards of officers are used for disruptive activities, or if Japanese rōnin (masterless samurai) participate, China is allowed to take decisive measures to thoroughly resolve the matter.

Their uniforms, weapons, and guns are complete. The Hebei Provincial Government and the leaders of the 1st and 2nd Special Police Detachments of the Luanyu-Jimi area and the Great Wall passes, Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu, etc., are leading their troops and coordinating with the local militias of various counties to implement an encirclement in order to eliminate the source of the chaos.

<h3 id="e21">Key to British Far East Policy: The Hong Kong Governorship Issue; Criticism from Hong Kong Newspapers <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Shanghai *North China Daily News* recently suggested that the position of Governor of Hong Kong should be filled by a highly qualified politician who, without reducing the powers of the British ambassadors to China and Japan, would also be responsible for reporting on Pacific affairs to the British government, so that Britain would have a clear course of action. The *South China Morning Post* and *Hong Kong Telegraph* both published articles criticizing this today. The *South China Morning Post* stated that the suggestion that the Governor of Hong Kong should be a highly qualified politician, not only an administrator but also a diplomat, is extremely stimulating. This suggestion is in direct contradiction with reality. The *North China Daily News* seems to blame the people of Hong Kong for not fulfilling their responsibility in promoting Sino-British friendship. While we admit that Hong Kong has continued to offend the Chinese in certain social events, this is more the fault of the British in Hong Kong than the fault of the Colonial Office. However, these events are limited to the spiritual aspect. As for material cooperation, Hong Kong has repeatedly expressed its wishes in recent years, but China has not responded. This is also something that Shanghai should know. Hong Kong's encouragement is neither short-sighted nor factual. Hong Kong is British territory and is governed by British law. British law conflicts with Chinese law in many ways. This situation has not been fully understood by Shanghai. Moreover, Hong Kong is a naval station and an army garrison. The psychology of both Hong Kong and China is often dominated by this. This fact forces Hong Kong to remain in a transcendent and independent position. If one wants to break this, one can only change the color of the place. The psychology of the *North China Daily News* seems to be that the British government uses Hong Kong as a base to try to preserve British influence in China in order to prevent its complete extinction. If this is the case, Hong Kong's responsibility is even greater, and the position of Governor seems to be beyond the capabilities of someone who can only adapt to circumstances. The person must have sufficient talent to manage state affairs in addition to handling municipal problems, which is not easy to find. Furthermore, it is impossible for the Governor to hold the positions of diplomat and government reporter without reducing the powers of the ambassadors to Nanjing and Tokyo. Therefore, even if Hong Kong values the suggestion of the *North China Daily News* and considers it to have value, it will be regarded as an impractical plan. Ten years ago, Hong Kong had a governor who was fond of politics, resulting in mere conflicts. If Hong Kong were to implement the plan of the *North China Daily News*, it would seem better to reduce the positions of the ambassadors in Nanjing and Tokyo to consul generals rather than making the Governor of Hong Kong a super ambassador. The editorial in the *Hong Kong Telegraph* stated that the *North China Daily News*'s advocacy of a highly qualified politician to serve as Governor of Hong Kong is like whipping a dead horse. This kind of advocacy is not new, but it does not take into account reality. The suggestion that the Governor should also hold diplomatic positions in China and Japan forgets that Hong Kong is only a port for navigation and a clearinghouse for the South China market. Hong Kong's contact with China is mostly in Guangzhou. Currently, the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangzhou is better than before. The *North China Daily News* accuses Hong Kong of short-sighted isolation, but this isolation is not accurate and is far less influential than the psychology of Shanghai. Shanghai's psychology often fails to be the isolation of neutral and good relations. Under general issues, Hong Kong does not need to separate from the management of the Colonial Office, nor is there a reason to think that this kind of change is feasible. The Colonial Office has already decided on the Governor's figure. If special circumstances require the connection of the Hong Kong government with diplomatic duties, the plan for the exchange of opinions that is required already exists.

<h3 id="e22">Chahar Provincial Government Sends Additional Personnel to Rescue Jones; Qin Dechun Cables Instructions to Ensure a Swift Rescue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, a telephone call was received in Beiping from Zhangjiakou, stating that at 5:00 AM this morning, the Chahar Provincial Government sent two more important officials from Zhangjiakou by car to Baochang, along with Platoon Leader Zhang of the Baochang Security Team, who had previously accompanied the German reporter Miller to escape. They will all go to the bandit den to rescue the British reporter Jones. Due to heavy rain in the Zhangbei area, the car is moving very slowly. The officials are expected to reach their destination tonight or tomorrow morning to discuss everything with the bandits. There should be concrete results tomorrow. The rumor that Jones has been freed and has returned to Beiping via Toronto is incorrect. The German reporter Miller had agreed with Jones and the bandit leader when leaving the bandit den that he would be responsible for negotiating with our country's officials to redeem Jones. Therefore, Miller left Beiping again for Zhangjiakou last night, arriving at 2:00 AM this morning. He consulted with the Chahar authorities and the British military officer Moore, who is now in Zhangjiakou, and it was decided that this afternoon he would go from Zhangjiakou to Baochang and then to the bandit den, accompanied by the personnel sent by the Provincial Government and Platoon Leader Zhang, to contact the bandits. Wang Kemin sent a long letter to Qin Dechun this morning, stating in the original letter that British reporter Jones is a [associate] of David Lloyd George and has a high position, so please try your best to find a way to get him out of danger as soon as possible. After receiving the letter, Qin immediately informed Yang Nan, the secretary-general of the Chahar Provincial Government, by long-distance telephone, instructing him to rescue Jones, and the bandits' demands could be considered and handled as appropriate within the possible scope. According to reports from foreigners, the bandits have now moved Jones to a mountain more than ten miles from the original den to hide him, in order to avoid official attention. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miller telegraphed to Beiping that the bandits seemed to have moved Jones to a certain place near the Rehe border, but the negotiation location for the representatives sent by the Chinese authorities to negotiate with the bandits is still near Baochang. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Zhangjiakou this morning, Jones' ransom has been sent from Zhangjiakou to Baochang. The amount is unknown. It is now hoped that Jones can get out of danger tomorrow or on Sunday. It is heard that the kidnappers have moved Jones to a certain location fifty miles east of Baochang, near the Rehe border. The people sent by the Chahar Provincial Government to contact the bandits have met with the bandits a few miles east of Guyuan. According to the latest news, the bandits have reduced the amount of the ransom to 10,000 yuan, which proves that the bandits now feel that the hostage is a burden. However, the troops have not coerced them to move Jones far away, which is puzzling. (3rd Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Military intelligence: After Peng Chengfu's troops captured Mayuanping on the 30th, they continued to attack Wang'anbao on the 1st. Because the bandits considered the place to be the barrier of Beichuan and their lifeline, they gathered heavy troops to defend the fortress to the death. We attacked several times, but the bandits resisted stubbornly. After nightfall, we divided our troops and used local guides to attack their rear, cutting off the bandits' retreat. The bandits increased their troops and charged with all their might, but our officers and soldiers remained calm and executed a fierce frontal attack. The bandits were unable to hold out and retreated toward Xiaoba. They are currently under pursuit. Beichuan City has now been officially recaptured. The victory in this battle was entirely due to the success of the flanking tactics used. Hundreds of bandits were killed. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Due to the impact of the social recession on the Ningbo financial community, since the four major money shops, Xinyuan, Taiyuan, Yongyuan, and Wuyuan, were liquidated on the 30th of last month, people's hearts have been fluctuating and depositors have been withdrawing cash one after another, resulting in a lack of turnover.

The county government has issued a notice restricting cash withdrawals and has borrowed 2 million [dollars] from the bank for relief. On the 2nd, Gongda, Chengyuan, Baohe, Hengxiang, Baohu, Taixun, Jingyuan, Huiyuan, Yuyuan, and nine other companies ran aground.

<h3 id="e40">Two Principles Regarding the Upbringing of Children <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The nationally designated Year of the Child began on August 1st. The entire nation has united to enthusiastically promote it. Its grand scale is universally admired. Truly, children are the future masters of the nation, the linchpin of the nation's rise and fall. If we wish to secure the foundation of the nation, we must prioritize laying a solid foundation. Now, with the advocacy of the party and government authorities above and the implementation by local agencies below, and with the establishment of implementation committees everywhere to jointly plan for the well-being of children, and with the talent and effort of the entire nation over the years, we will surely be able to formulate practical steps to serve as a general standard for progress. How fortunate are these young scholars to encounter this favorable time, to sharpen their minds and take advantage of the momentum to rise up. The brilliance of their future will be limitless.</p>
<p>Regarding plans for children's education, the discussions of prominent figures and the designs of experts should not lack grand strategies and sound advice that can be followed. Here, I offer my humble opinion on the principles of implementation.</p>
<p>First, with regard to the aspect of cultivation, we should establish appropriate norms. Children are innocent and unblemished, with unrestrained emotions. They become red or black depending entirely on their surroundings. A careless beginning makes a successful ending difficult to achieve. Therefore, under the supervision of teachers, guardians, fathers, and elder brothers, we should strive to avoid negative impressions. Just as pure buds should be carefully protected in every way, we must not allow them to be stained by muddy soil. The distinction between good and evil, and the evaluation of superior and inferior, can be repeatedly presented and subtly explained by adults at any time. What is fairness? What is baseness? What is integrity? What is treachery? This will allow children to develop a sound concept of personality and prevent them from easily wavering in their principles in the future. Teachers should take this as the goal of moral education, and fathers and elder brothers should especially serve as role models for the young. However, if we adults reflect on the past, we will truly feel ashamed when facing the children. We ask ourselves honestly, even if we have not actively committed evil deeds, we have inevitably neglected to prevent evil from occurring. The people are the masters of the country. Have we truly fulfilled our responsibilities as masters, even in a small way? Leaving other things aside, the existence of a cowardly mentality is already an indelible testament to our guilt. And yet we dare to speak of being role models? Do we not feel ashamed? To make amends for the past, we can only resolutely confess our faults and point out the gains and losses, so that the future masters of the nation will clearly understand the duties of a citizen, and so that they will not repeat the mistakes of fear and hesitation. If we can learn from our mistakes, there is still hope for redemption. It is not too late to make amends.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the aspect of enlightenment, we should be based entirely on science. The need for children's education to be based on science is not only for the sake of their academic future, but also essential for their general reasoning ability. In the past, there was no lack of intelligent and eloquent youth, but when it came to distinguishing between emotions and reason, it was always difficult to expect accurate understanding. Numerical statistics were carelessly approximate, and the distinction between right and wrong often involved ambiguity. All these errors in judgment are due to the lack of scientific concepts. Children generally inherit these qualities, and it is difficult to eliminate them because they are deeply ingrained. If their education from the beginning is based on science, then as a result of gradual and reasoned explanations, it will not be difficult for them to gradually develop clear minds. The benefits to their future understanding will be more than just a small improvement. Furthermore, books that contradict scientific principles and could hinder the development of children's thinking should be strictly prohibited and absolutely not allowed to be read. This will reduce the unexpected harm and promote overall progress.</p>
<p>The above two points require the joint efforts of fathers, elder brothers, and teachers, and should consider both moral cultivation and academic knowledge to create a majority of good young people. On the one hand, this will cultivate the future pillars of the country, and on the other hand, it will wash away our past sins. At the beginning of the Year of the Child, I dare to express this idea, which those with a sense of responsibility should not ignore.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Japanese Government Issues Statement Clarifying National Polity, Forcefully Rejects the Theory of the Emperor as an Organ of State, Army Authorities Express Satisfaction <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Okada Discusses the Advancement or Retreat of the Privy Council President and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government issued a statement clarifying the national polity at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The full text is as follows: The national polity of Japan was manifested in the divine decree issued when the Heavenly Grandson descended upon this country, that is, that the Emperor of an unbroken line reigns over the country, and the prosperity of the imperial lineage is as limitless as heaven and earth. At the time of the promulgation of the Constitution, Emperor Meiji issued an edict stating, "The great authority to govern the country, I inherit from my ancestors, and transmit to my descendants." Furthermore, Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates, "The Emperor of Japan reigns over and governs the Empire of Japan in an unbroken line." That the great authority to govern Japan clearly resides in the Emperor is quite evident. However, to assume that the authority to govern does not reside in the Emperor, but that the Emperor is merely an organ for exercising the authority to govern, is contrary to the unique essence of the Japanese national polity. Recently, there have been various discussions on constitutional theory regarding the essence of the national polity, which is deeply regrettable. The government hereby dedicates itself to clarifying the national polity, in order to reveal its essence. It earnestly hopes that all parties will cooperate to this end. This is hereby declared. (3rd day Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada issued a statement saying that the government has already clarified the national polity. It is said that the President of the Privy Council, Ikkii Kitokuro, is a proponent of the organ theory. However, Mr. Ikkii studied national law 34 years ago and spoke of the position of the Japanese Emperor. Since entering the Imperial Court, he has detached himself from the position and learning of a scholar and has reached this point today. Therefore, there is no possibility of the issue of Mr. Ikkii's advancement or retreat arising. It has also been rumored that the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Mr. Kanemori, will resign. However, I am confident that Mr. Kanemori is by no means a proponent of the organ theory, so there is no possibility of his resignation. As for the disposition of other scholars who advocate the organ theory and their writings, the authorities of the Ministry of Home Affairs will resolve it in accordance with the policy decided by the Cabinet. (3rd day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army authorities expressed satisfaction with the government's issuance of the statement. The text advocating the rejection of the organ theory, etc., as advocated by the army and navy, has been adopted in the statement, and the attitude has been clarified. It can be seen that the government is truly sincere on this issue. However, the issuance of the statement is only one means of rejecting the organ theory and clarifying the national polity. There will be opportunities in the future to thoroughly resolve this issue in order to clarify the national polity. (3rd day Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government firmly believes that the issuance of the statement clarifying the national polity will resolve the theory of the Emperor as an organ of state, which has been a problem in political circles for the past half year. When the initial movement to reject the organ theory was at its height, the government recognized that there were unsavory elements with the aim of overthrowing the cabinet, and therefore maintained a cautious attitude toward all matters. Recently, the army and navy have actively demanded that this issue be resolved, and because the future appears promising, it has decided to issue the statement. Now that the hopes of the military have been realized, it is expected that there is no possibility of this issue developing further. (3rd day Domei dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi will go to Hokkaido around the 12th for inspection. Before his departure, he plans to meet with Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, in his capacity as the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, to instruct him on the policies to be implemented toward Manchuria. The main points are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Since the reform of the Manchurian institutions, the political structure of Japan in Manchuria has been controlled by the Commander of the Kwantung Army and the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and it is now entering a period of activity in economic, industrial, and construction projects.</p>
<p>(2) The South Manchuria Railway has a major mission for economic, industrial, and construction projects in Manchuria. The president and leading personnel should be aware of the importance of their mission, stand from the perspective of the nation, and implement management affairs.</p>
<p>(3) In implementing industrial construction projects in Manchuria, it is first necessary to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway to adapt to the new situation after the Manchurian Incident.

<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet aviator Levanevsky, along with two companions, took off from Moscow at 6:00 this morning aboard a single-engine aircraft, heading directly to San Francisco via the Arctic, with no stops along the way. The American ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, and senior Soviet officials were at the airfield to see them off. Levanevsky's plane carried a stove for use in case of a forced landing over the Arctic Ocean. In addition, 40 meteorological stations have been specially set up in the Arctic region to provide Levanevsky with real-time reference information. As Levanevsky took off, it was pouring rain. However, when the plane was 150 kilometers away, it radioed back that the weather was very clear. If there are no obstacles, it should be able to fly to San Francisco within 70 hours. (3rd day Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet aviator Levanevsky has now flown out of Russia and plans to reach San Francisco via the Arctic. The Soviet authorities hope to establish a regular air route between Russia and the United States via the Arctic in the future. It is reported that Levanevsky is carrying sufficient equipment and food. If he is unfortunately forced to land in the Arctic, he can at least sustain his life for three months. A team of icebreakers and several aircraft are concentrated in the Arctic Ocean, ready to go to his aid as soon as a distress call is received.</p>
<p>(Continuation) Levanevsky flew to the Barents Sea, the southeastern corner of the Arctic Ocean, at 12:25. (3rd day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The aircraft flying directly from Moscow to San Francisco has only one engine, with 950 horsepower. There are three crew members in total. The plane weighs 11 tons, including gasoline. The range of the plane is 8,100 kilometers, while the distance from Moscow to San Francisco is only 6,250 kilometers. (3rd day Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet aviator Captain Levanevsky plans to fly an airplane through the Arctic directly to the United States to open up a regular air and mail route between Russia and the United States via the Arctic. Preparations have been underway for some time, and he departed at 6:00 this morning, accompanied by Bedugov and Lekinko, from the Churchikov airfield, 40 kilometers from here, heading to San Francisco. Only a very small number of people were granted permission to enter the airfield at that time. Journalists were invited to come at 1:00 PM. By 3:00 AM, military police had driven around the airfield three times for security, and the entire airfield was still shrouded in darkness. By 4:00 AM, the east gradually began to brighten, and then two aircraft were seen rising into the air. They were test flights. At that time, within 150 kilometers of Moscow, there was heavy rain. Levanevsky's plane was carrying 7,200 liters of gasoline and 500 kilograms of engine oil. The weight was considerable, and flying in the rain was dangerous. Therefore, people at the airfield were anxious, fearing that Levanevsky's heroic feat would be hampered by the rain and unable to be completed. Just as they were hesitating, news came that Levanevsky had decided to take off. The whole airfield cheered. At that time, People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov, People's Commissar for Internal Affairs Yezhov, and the American Ambassador to Russia Bullitt and his wife were talking with the three aviators to be sent off next to the plane. At 5:45 AM, the engine of the plane started to turn. At 6:00, a signal to leave the airfield was given. At 6:05, the plane started to move. Twenty minutes later, looking at the plane from afar, it was in good condition, soaring straight into the clouds. This flight will cover 3,000 kilometers over land and several thousand kilometers over the sea. At the beginning of the flight, the speed will not exceed 150 kilometers per hour. But along the way, as the gasoline is gradually consumed, the weight of the plane will decrease, and the speed will also increase accordingly. The plane is a monoplane with extremely long wings, reaching 40 meters. The plane body is painted red, and the cockpit is extremely small, hidden in the huge fuselage, making it almost impossible to distinguish from a distance. (3rd day Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Addis Ababa) The Ethiopian King told a Reuters reporter this afternoon that he had instructed his representative in Geneva, Haile Hawariat, to sign the resolution drafted by Eden and Laval so that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute could be resolved peacefully. (3rd day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Attention in Geneva is now focused on the Ethiopian representative, Haile Hawariat. Many people gathered in front of his hotel today, hoping to catch a glimpse of this short, dark-skinned, mustachioed gentleman leaving the hotel. A team of film cameramen was also on standby, hoping to capture his image. Haile Hawariat is currently in close consultation with his legal counsel, Dr. Juraj Ghyczy. Multiple coded telegrams are on his desk. They are awaiting instructions from Addis Ababa. Even if a telegram arrives approving the resolution, the heart of the problem still needs to be dealt with by the British, French, and Italian representatives in France. The current procedures only move the situation slightly forward. The Council of the League of Nations is expected to meet at 5:00 PM this afternoon, but the time may have to be changed. Most representatives are now preparing their speeches, and Eden's speech is particularly important. The Ethiopian representative's speech is also of great interest. Litvinov's declaration on the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy has not yet been finalized, as the Ethiopian representative may make a statement, so it may have to be delayed slightly. (3rd day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The public meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, which was originally scheduled to convene at 10:00 AM today, has been postponed to the afternoon because the Ethiopian representative needs to request instructions from Addis Ababa regarding the newly established mediation method, and because the British representative requested that the British government be given the opportunity to carefully consider several key points. (3rd day Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A complete compromise was reached last night on the resolution concerning the Italo-Ethiopian dispute that will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations. The resolution will be submitted to the Council meeting this afternoon after receiving the Ethiopian government's reply. It stipulates (1) the resumption of mediation on the case of the Walwal clashes; (2) the appointment of a fifth arbitrator; (3) the Council will reconvene on September 4 to discuss the entire issue. The second section of the resolution refers to the Council's resolution of May 25 regarding the resolution of the dispute being implemented in accordance with Article 5 of the 1928 treaty (this is to implicitly include the declaration not to resort to force). Council Chairman Litvinov will read a declaration today concerning the fact that the three countries, namely the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, are willing to negotiate in accordance with the 1906 treaty. One of the biggest difficulties now is that the United Kingdom insists that the League of Nations should negotiate with Italy in accordance with the 1906 treaty. Yesterday afternoon, responsible parties stated that the differences between the three major countries, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, have been reconciled to the point where complete harmony can be expected within 12 hours, so all parties are optimistic that a compromise can be achieved. The Council was originally scheduled to meet last night, but was temporarily canceled. After negotiations, the differences between the United Kingdom and Italy remain only a minor matter regarding the reference clause, which should not be difficult to resolve. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini indicated in a telegram that Italy is willing to abide by the resolution. (3rd day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report from the Times correspondent in Addis Ababa, the people of Addis Ababa felt disappointed and heartbroken after receiving news from Geneva. Some even thought that Ethiopia had been fooled and had lost its original position in the League of Nations. This is because Ethiopia's appeal to the League of Nations was based on the provisions of the Covenant, but now it is advocating negotiations based on the 1906 treaty between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy regarding Ethiopia, which has disappointed the expectations of Ethiopia. The correspondent also said that the Ethiopian Emperor may issue a new declaration and issue new instructions to the representatives attending the Council meeting. (3rd day Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) On July 6th, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a warning-filled speech to the Blackshirts, in which he said, "You are invincible; you will soon see the five continents bend and tremble before the power of Fascism." The full text of his speech has just been released to newspapers, but the newspapers only carried the main points. Mussolini also said, "You are about to go to Abyssinia, and the entire territory of Abyssinia will belong to you. If the Abyssinians resist our terrible power, we will subject them to burning and plunder. We will slap the cheeks of the white protectors among the blacks and retaliate." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italians believe that Abyssinia is Mussolini's trump card. He is determined to stake everything on it. If he wins in one fell swoop, he will be remembered in history, and future generations will view his martial prowess as surpassing Caesar. If he fails, Italian politics will undergo a complete new orientation. The outcome is of great importance, and the entire psychology of the Fascist Party is now focused on this. Therefore, the strategies employed by the League of Nations and Britain and France through the 1906 treaty cannot prevent Italy from gambling on this victory or defeat. The Italian attitude towards Abyssinia can be seen from this. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from Naples today, two Italian ships arrived at night, carrying back three thousand sick soldiers from African colonies. They were then quietly distributed to various hospitals in Italy. At the same time, a laborer who had just returned to Italy from Africa reported that Commander-in-Chief Graziani severely threatened those who complained. It was also said that for those who were sick, their daily pay was reduced by two lire. The discipline in the colonies is even stricter than in the early days of the Fascist civilian army. The return of the sick soldiers has slightly dampened the courage of the citizens who are scheduled to depart. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government may mobilize all fourth-class soldiers at any moment, totaling approximately 800,000 men. Two army divisions, totaling 30,000 men, and the remaining soldiers from the 1912 class, totaling 150,000 men, will be officially announced today. Three ships transporting soldiers and war materials to East Africa departed from Naples today. There are also twelve ships currently busy loading troops. In addition, one or more divisions of Blackshirts will be called up before the end of this session of the League of Nations Council. This action demonstrates that Italy, regardless of the interference of the League of Nations or other parties, is vigorously pursuing its planned plan. At the same time, Italian writer Gaeda published an article in a newspaper commenting on British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons on Thursday, expressing that Italy may be forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, calling Hoare's words cowardly, and questioning whether Hoare's final section mentioning British military strength was intended to intimidate Italy. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Italian newspaper recently published a commentary stating, "British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech yesterday in the British House of Commons regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute was quite strong in tone and even carried a hint of intimidation. This speech shows that Britain's current policy toward Italy has taken an openly hostile attitude. Hoare's speech does not contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute; on the contrary, it spreads a cloud over British-Italian relations, and it will be very difficult to dispel this cloud." The newspaper then pointed out the following three points: "(1) The 1915 Secret Treaty of London between Britain, France, and Italy allowed Italy to expand its colonies, but Italy was rejected during the signing of the peace treaty after the war and could not obtain Germany's pre-war colonies. Now that Britain is unwilling to propose to the League of Nations to amend the mandate system, Italy can only seek colonies on its own. (2) Italy has not taken a stand against the League of Nations; it only opposes Britain's interpretation of the League of Nations Covenant. If Italy is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations over the Abyssinian issue, it would be a serious blow to the collective security plan. (3) We acknowledge that France has repeatedly voiced support for Italy; what we are now paying attention to is that France will surely clarify the situation." (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>Alexandria: Italians here are now doing their best to win Egyptian public opinion over to Italy, hoping to dispel the various sympathies that the Egyptian people have recently expressed towards Abyssinia. The British here are greatly disturbed by an article published in a Fascist newspaper, which first described Italy's peaceful intentions towards Abyssinia, and then described Italy's long-standing friendship with Egypt, urging the Egyptian people not to deeply believe the criticisms of others, because in their eyes, pacifying Abyssinia is tantamount to losing a prize. The article's anti-British sentiment is very obvious, stating that Italy will protect Abyssinia, so that it will not be harmed by those with ambition, because these people, although they have already obtained Sudan and have ruled the Nile River basin, are still not satisfied.

<p>(London) Today, all newspapers commented on the Indian bill approved by the British Emperor yesterday, which grants autonomy to 350 million Indians. The Times editorial said that future generations will list the preparation and passage of this bill as the highest and noblest expression of political courage, decisiveness, and wisdom of this era. The Morning Post praised the persistence of those who opposed the plan, saying that they did so only because they believed that this move would harm the Indian people and be detrimental to the Indian Empire, and we are grateful that we do not bear the moral part of the responsibility for this move. The Manchester Guardian stated that the first task of Indian politicians will be to build public opinion that can eliminate the selfishness of race and class, and the doubts about India. If the Hindu, Muslim, and Untouchable classes insist on their final demands, this kind of public opinion can never be created. The Daily Mail stated that the bill is indeed a tragic shirking and denial of our national responsibility. The Financial News stated that India's credit is currently quite high, and the Governor-General of India's power contains direct control of 80% of the federal budget, and this credit should be maintained for a long time. The Daily News stated that if the Indian National Congress can use its new power with a clear sense of political talent, the power reserved for the Governor-General of India may never be used.

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, the chief engineer of the Huai River Conservancy, talked to reporters on the 3rd about the remedial measures for the Yellow River entering Jiangsu, saying that if the Yellow River changes course after entering Jiangsu, not only will Jiangsu Province turn into a disaster, but the Huai River Conservancy project will also suffer losses. The remedy is nothing more than building dikes extensively and trying to reduce the flow at the Dongzhuang breach. As for the remedial measures for the Yellow River in Shandong, technically, there are (1) diverting the flow northward to return to the Yellow River, (2) carrying out the work of blocking the breach and cutting off the flow at each breach, and it would be best to divert the river and cut off the flow, (3rd) Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Zhejiang Salt Commissioner submitted to the Ministry of Finance that the salt tax levied on each dan of Zhejiang salt is more than seven yuan, resulting in the flooding of smuggled salt and the obstruction of official salt sales. The warehouses are piled up, and if no measures are taken to rectify the situation, the future of tax revenue will be unimaginable. Last year, Zhejiang Province's salt tax was short by about 3 million yuan compared to the promulgated quota, and the impact will inevitably be more serious in the future. The method of rectification is first to reduce the tax rate, and second to increase the strength of anti-smuggling. More anti-smuggling teams should be stationed in the eastern part of Zhejiang as a preventive measure. The Ministry of Finance has submitted it to the Salt Reform Committee of the Salt Affairs Administration for review and reply, so that it can be verified and handled. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Establishment of North China Rural Relief Association and International Bank Branch</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: It has recently been widely rumored here that Gao Lingrui, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Northern Government, and Wang Shuangqi and other gentlemen in Tianjin, have initiated the organization of the North China Rural Relief Committee, with the aim of developing transportation, water conservancy, minerals, and agricultural crops in Hebei and Chahar. The funds will be provided by the Japanese International Bank, and the Japanese propaganda says that this move is another way for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, Gao Lingrui has recently troubled his friends to unofficially deny the rumors to the newspapers, saying that Japanese friends have indeed exchanged opinions on this in private conversations, and he has only discussed it slightly from an objective standpoint and has not immediately agreed with any party or person to determine how to cooperate. However, denials were made, but rumors continue. It is difficult to make a judgment on the truth of the event. The Japanese International Bank, whose headquarters is located in Tokyo, has now sent Director Shohtaro Yoshihara and Deputy Chief Sakamura to Tianjin to prepare for the establishment of a branch. The address has been found at 34 Fazu Street in the Meiye Building. It is scheduled to start operating unofficially in late August. Gu Yuan and Sakamura are currently engaged in activities related to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, contacting banks, industrialists, and influential military and political figures in Tianjin and Beiping who have huge amounts of capital, hoping to cooperate with the goal of developing resources, abandoning government relations. Quite a few people believe in their saying, and they are constantly negotiating with each other. It is heard that the funds for the branch are planned to be independent, set at US$15 million. In addition to the Japanese capital invested by the headquarters, some Chinese capital will also be raised in North China as the Chinese representative capital. This plan, the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation discussed by Chinese and Japanese economic industrialists in the Jiashu Society in the British Concession of Tianjin on the 25th and 26th of last month, has the same purpose. Because although the Japanese are currently advocating Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, they require too much money, and if they want to realize their plan in one fell swoop, the facts are not possible, and their financial resources are also insufficient. Therefore, they are pulling out Chinese private capital, nominally cooperating, so as to proceed quickly. It is also the unanimous opinion of the Japanese Kwantung Army Department, the North China Garrison Department, and the South Manchuria Railway. Since the middle of last month, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Shenyang Japanese Industry and Commerce North China Investigation Group have sent people to work in Tianjin, Beiping, Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, and Suiyuan. In addition to most of the group members investigating relevant materials and returning to Dalian and Shenyang, there are still a few group members working in Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other areas, such as measuring the Hai River and investigating the import and export cargo figures and types of customs. It is heard that the Japanese intend to deepen the Hai River in the name of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation so that cargo ships of more than 2,000 tons can directly reach Tianjin. They also plan to invest in the construction of a lateral railway connecting the Jinpu and Pinghan lines, starting from Cang County on the Jinpu line and reaching Shijiazhuang on the Pinghan line. If necessary, they may extend the Cang County area and build it to Dagu and Geju under the sea, as the two major land and water transportation lines. In addition, there is a plan to connect the Pinghan and Jiaoji lines, but the starting and ending points have not yet been determined. (1st)</p>

<p>Over Forty Counties Report Bandit Troubles, Shang Zhen Plans to Advance and Suppress</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Hebei Province Chairman Shang Zhen recently went from Baoding to Ping to meet with Wang Kemin to report on provincial administration since taking office, and made some requests. He then went to Tianjin to handle matters at the Tianjin-Gu Security Headquarters. On the 29th of last month, he returned to Baoding from Ping. He then summoned all the department heads at his residence to discuss financial and bandit suppression issues in the province. According to Shang, after returning to Baoding, he slightly reorganized the provincial administration and planned to inspect various counties. Bandit troubles have occurred frequently in the province, with over forty counties reporting bandit activity. The bandit situation in Wen'an and Ba Counties has recently become particularly rampant. He believes that unless bandit troubles are cleared up, the people cannot live in peace. Therefore, he plans to divide the province into three areas: north, south, and central. He will also transfer strong troops to organize three bandit suppression detachments to carry out vigorous suppression, with the aim of clearing them out as soon as possible. As for the bandits in the reed marshes of Wen'an and Ba Counties, Song Kentang's troops are currently handling the suppression. The reed marshes in that area are deep and extensive, and the air inside is foul. Many soldiers become dizzy after entering. The method of attack has now been changed, and then a general offensive will be ordered. It is expected that they can be completely eliminated soon. In addition, the province's financial deficit is huge. In addition to Lu Xian going to Shanghai to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to explain everything and request assistance, the Finance Department is also drafting a comprehensive report on the financial situation. After it is approved at the provincial government's regular meeting, it will be submitted to the central government for review and decision. Transportation between Ping, Baoding, and Tianjin is being actively reorganized. All telephone lines and highways will be repaired soon, and so on. After Shang's remarks, he went to the provincial government. That evening, he summoned Finance Director Li Jingrong at his private residence to discuss how to reorganize the province's finances until late at night.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Inspection Report on Flood Disaster Along Rivers <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent Ya of This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Tracing Up the Xiang River</p>
<p>This Yangtze River flood has been most devastating to Hubei Province. Among the counties in Hubei Province, those in the Xiang River basin have suffered the most severely. The Xiang River originates from the Panlong Mountain in Shaanxi and passes through Hanzhong (Nanzheng), so it is also known as the Han River. It flows eastward in a winding course, and all the waters of northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi flow into it. Upon entering Hubei, it also receives the Du River, Dan River, Nan River, and San River. When it flows to Xiangyang and Fancheng, the large Bai River also joins it. It meanders southeastward and flows into the Yangtze River, a distance of over three thousand li. From Xiangfan downstream, the counties it passes through, such as Yicheng, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Jingshan, Mianyang, Tianmen, Hanchuan, and Hanyang, are only fifty meters above sea level. The land is flat and unobstructed, with interconnected lakes and streams. When one river swells and one dike breaks, nearby areas are invariably affected. Shaanxi has always been known as a drought-prone province, but this summer there has been continuous heavy rain. The Xiang River, which collects all the waters south of the Qinling Mountains, surges and rushes downstream to Chu. Initially, it overflowed in Yunxi, Gucheng, and Xiangfan, and the damage was limited to the areas along the banks. Subsequently, the Shuanghe Dike (belonging to Tianmen County) and the Shizi Estuary (belonging to Zhongxiang County, located between Maliang and Jiukou, also known as San Si Gong and Longwang Temple, upstream of Shuanghe Estuary, which breached one day after Shuanghe Dike) successively collapsed. Interconnecting and crisscrossing, the water rose more than ten feet above the ground, completely submerging the entire territory of Tianmen, Hanchuan, and Hanyang, as well as large parts of Jingshan, Yingcheng, Xiaogan, Huangpi, Qianjiang, and Mianyang, in a vast expanse of floodwaters. At that time, how the flood torrents came like shaking mountains and moving peaks, how the villages collapsed and drifted away, how the disaster-stricken people cried to heaven without response and appealed to earth without recourse, not knowing how to struggle painfully, and finally drowned and died. We all belong to the same species, the same nation with shared joys and sorrows. Try to close your eyes and imagine this tragedy that exhausts human misery. Shouldn't we be able to move with compassion, each with a heart to treat others' misfortune as our own, and do our best to seek good follow-up measures?</p>
<p>Having decided to go to the aforementioned Xiang River region to investigate, the reporter boarded a steamer from Hankou on the 27th and traced up the Xiang River. Where the river enters the Yangtze, the current is unusually rapid, with a lot of sediment mixed in. The difference in the quality and color of the water from the Yangtze is almost like the Jing and Wei Rivers. Cotton mills, flour mills, and other factories line both banks, numbering no less than thirty or forty. However, less than one-tenth of them are emitting black smoke, presumably due to economic panic or the suspension of work due to the flood. Hanyang is located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers, with low-lying terrain. The rising waters of both rivers have caused disasters, and nineteen out of ten of the urban and rural areas have been flooded. More than 470,000 people have been affected, scattered and displaced, in a very miserable state. Fortunately, news of the disaster upstream was received early, and fewer people have died. However, the disaster victims have no food, and it is difficult to provide sufficient relief. In more remote villages, there have been incidents of looting for food. Like sparks starting a prairie fire, we cannot but pay close attention to this. Boats and ships ply the river like shuttles. Those going upstream mostly carry wood, bamboo from Hunan, and food. Those going downstream mostly carry furniture such as trunks, cabinets, pots, and jars, as disaster victims try to escape. Occasionally, there are boats carrying "Shigao" (a specialty of Yingcheng) and "Maling melon," all covered in yellow mud. The Xiang River basin was originally a rich agricultural area in central Hubei. In previous years, the Xiang River was a thousand miles long, transporting food and cotton to Wuhan for concentration. But now, seeing this abnormal scene, one cannot help but feel desolate. Looking to the right at the Luojia Store area where the river flows into Moon Lake, many houses have been washed away, and few people live there. Outside the dike, the water is still connected to the sky, with no end in sight. Looking to the left, the hills rise and fall, resembling islands in a deep pool. Disaster victims have built sheds and huts, stretching endlessly. The willows and distant trees on both sides of the dike, with fallen leaves, seem to be in autumn, and the fields and ridges are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Caidian is a town in the second district of Hanyang, 60 li from Hankou. It has a large population and relatively prosperous commerce. When the floodwaters rose sharply, because the town was lower than the water level, the residents all fled to Xijia Ridge. However, those who were working in the nearby fields or were struggling to protect miscellaneous items drowned more than 200 people. The total population of the district is 130,000. Because the fields have been submerged and no harvest has been reaped, everyone is trapped in a water prison and starving village. According to the old farmers, if the water recedes quickly within half a month, it is still possible to replant mung beans and millet. If it is delayed until the end of August, it will be too late. Moreover, after the disaster this autumn, they will not be able to plant wheat, and a spring famine next year will be inevitable. Fortunately, the emergency work-relief program prepared by the Provincial Disaster Relief Association is being implemented step by step to alleviate the immediate emergency and eliminate future hidden worries.</p>
<p>The Huangjiadu River bends and meanders for more than twenty li. Sailboats have a shallow draft and can pass directly through the gaps between the willows on the embankment. Therefore, those far behind the steamer all rushed straight ahead. From Xuyou Caidian to Hanchuan, the water route is 120 li, but the land route is only 50 li. Also, from Hanchuan to Fanmakou, the water route is 30 li, but the land route is only 7 li. There are probably countless such bends upstream. In the future, if the river channel is dredged, bends straightened, and straightened, the benefits of eliminating harm and promoting benefits cannot be overstated. From Caidian to Huangjiadu to Xingu, the water route is 60 li. In the middle, there are two or three breaches on the left embankment, which have been flooded by lake water. The clear blue waves are distinctly different from the river water. River fish compete to welcome the lake water, making fishing very easy. The disaster victims living on the embankment, whether because they were envious of the fish in the deep water or driven by hunger, even used their clothes and pants as nets. This is also an original sight on this trip. In addition, disaster victims who are exposed to the elements often worship the clay and wooden idols they have rescued as usual, with red flags and green covers, which is quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>Xingu is also a town along the river in Hanyang. At this point, the waterway splits into two: one goes north to Yingcheng and Tianmen, which is the Yun River, a tributary of the Xiang River; the other goes west to Hanchuan and Mianyang, which is the main stream of the Xiang River. The steamer the reporter boarded was going to Hanchuan. There are about 2,000 residents in Xingu, about 300 households. There is a red-tiled tea house that is two or three stories taller than other houses and can be seen from dozens of miles away. It is said to have been built more than ten years ago. Now, the local economy is exhausted and there is no ability to rebuild such buildings. The Xiang River rose sharply on July 11, reaching the eaves of houses. After the 14th, it gradually receded. Although the water has now receded from the banks, many of the foundations of the houses along the river have been washed away by the flood, and the houses are suspended in the air, which is not safe to live in for a day. However, most of the house owners are disaster victims who are struggling to survive and have no way to seek other help. The streets are full of mud and sewage, and the stench is overwhelming. The scattered food sold is especially the place where flies and mosquitoes gather. After a major disaster, it is easy to suffer from the epidemic. If it is not treated early, I am afraid that the disaster victims will eventually form an inextricable relationship with death. Alas! (Xingu, July 27)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu Yuzhong Cotton Mill was founded by Li Bohang and others, and has been in operation for more than ten years. The capital reached a huge amount of one million yuan. The size of the machinery factory is the only industrial construction in Anhui Province. At the time of commencement, there were a total of one thousand four or five hundred employees and workers. Before 1929, the conditions in terms of products and sales were excellent, and there were often surpluses. Unexpectedly, since 1929, due to the increasingly deteriorating situation, although it has been reorganized repeatedly, it has still been opened and closed from time to time, and it is difficult to reverse the declining fortune. It is heard that the deficit in the past year has reached 500,000 yuan. After struggling to maintain it until the previous month, it was really unable to handle the aftermath, and finally stopped work and announced its closure. The total debt reached three million yuan. In addition to the deposited cotton yarn mortgage, which can be worth 1.45 million yuan, the actual loss is still 1.3 million yuan, which far exceeds the total capital. Last month, a shareholders' meeting was held in Shanghai, and all believed that a thorough liquidation was necessary. In addition to entrusting accountant Pan Xulun to be responsible for the liquidation, five people with the most shares were designated to be responsible for supervision. All accounts have now been sent to Shanghai, and the factory has also sent people to take care of them. Once the liquidation is completed, we will plan the method of closing. The largest creditor is the Industrial Bank, with more than 700,000 yuan, and Jiyuan Silver Company, with 450,000 yuan. It is predicted that priority creditors may be able to share some of them, but as for ordinary creditors, they are afraid that there will be no hope. From now on, the only industrial factory in Anhui Province has gone bankrupt and cannot survive. The livelihoods of thousands of people directly and indirectly will also be greatly panicked.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Smuggling Foreign Rice and Foreign Sugar in Chaoshan —— Taiwan Intensifies Smuggling —— <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: A certain country is actively developing its economic aggression policy, and is using Taiwanese people in various places to carry out large-scale smuggling. The smuggled goods are not simply goods from a certain country, but also goods from various countries that are subject to heavy taxes and are related to the daily necessities of people's livelihoods. For example, rice and sugar are currently the most smuggled goods by Taiwanese people. Shantou rice merchants have suffered great losses due to the impact of smuggled foreign rice and plan to suspend the import of foreign rice. Provincial sugar has also been greatly affected in sales due to the impact of smuggled foreign sugar. After the special tax on foreign rice, the cost per bag has increased from seven or eight yuan to seventeen or eighteen yuan. Chaoshan rice and plum food were originally extremely scarce, and all relied on foreign rice to provide relief. After the government levied foreign rice tax, the people's burden became heavier. At this time of rural economic bankruptcy, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, bearing this heavy burden, it is bound to be overturned. The Taiwanese smugglers, relying on special forces, openly took the opportunity to smuggle foreign rice into the country, resisting the payment of all taxes and donations. Tax and donation inspectors, because of fear of their fierce, do not dare to ask, let them transport in constantly. This foreign rice, mostly from Japan and Siam, transported by Japan and Siam, or transshipped from Hong Kong, concentrated in Shantou, in addition to selling this city, the rest are operated by the mainland smuggling Taiwanese people and traitors, transported to various parts of the mainland for sale, the price per bag is reduced by more than two yuan compared to the market price. According to the investigation, from April 15 of this year to the present, the Taiwanese have transported a total of more than 50,000 bags of smuggled foreign rice, worth more than 400,000 yuan. This foreign rice avoids foreign rice tax of more than 200,000 yuan. Local rice merchants, because it is difficult to compete, have slightly reduced the purchase of foreign rice in recent months, and turned to do Fujian rice and Wuhu rice should market, so the current market existing foreign rice, there are only more than 100,000 bags, one month later, you can sell out, but Fujian rice also because local taxes, there is a problem, resulting in being prohibited from export, Wuhu rice because the Yangtze River flood prohibited export, there are no goods to Shantou, now rice merchants decided to find ways to request the recovery of Fujian rice transport Shantou,</p>
<p>After the sugar was implemented by selling the unified sale, the province-owned sugar sold only one product, and the foreign sugar was sold out. The Taiwanese people have been able to profit from the private transportation of sugar, so they have contacted profiteers in various places to operate the private transportation of foreign sugar into the country, in addition to the cost of three or four yuan per bag, the rest of all taxes can be avoided, compared to the province-owned sugar price of 20 yuan per bag, the difference of 14 or 5 yuan, this private sugar, transported by fishing boats, reloaded in Shantou, that is, transferred to the mainland for sale, its sales not only Chaoshan, that is, Meishu sales, but also very prosperous, because greedy for cheap goods are more welcome, Recently, the Chaozhou Customs has successively seized this private sugar, the number up to thousands of bags, the province-owned product management office Shantou branch manager He Zhongming, had gone to Chaoan Jieyang Fengshun Meixian Dapu and other counties, to inspect the sales situation of private sugar, now has returned to Shantou,据, Chaoshan private sugar is full of, the sales of provincial sugar are greatly affected, now should find a way to prevent private sugar sales, also soil sugar for the largest crop in Chaozhou, annual exports of 10 million yuan, for the economic lifeline of the Chaoshan rural areas, this time the provincial management office, suddenly stipulated that soil sugar must be registered with the office, Shantou Sugar Industry Association, with its suffocation difficult to do, especially letter Shantou manager branch, transferred to request the storage of sugar distribution export, Check the current city of soil sugar, a total of about 300 to 400,000 dan, are transported to North China and Central China for sale,</p>
<h3 id="e89">Famine in Shunde and Zhongshan Counties of Guangdong Province: Rural Bankruptcy, Starvation Everywhere, Local People Collect Funds and Provide Congee <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Shunde, Zhongshan, and other counties in Guangdong Province have always been dominated by silk exports. Unexpectedly, in recent years, the silk industry has declined, and silk exports have almost been cut off. In the past, silk exports were worth more than 2,000 yuan per package, but now each package (about 100 catties) has dropped to 200 yuan, and no one cares. As a result, silkworm farmers have lost their jobs, the rural economy has gone bankrupt, the old and weak have died in ditches, and the young and strong have scattered in all directions. Selling children and daughters is heard every day. Most of the female workers have also gone to Nanyang to temporarily make a living. At present, mulberry fields are barren and the sound of looms has stopped. Recently, although the promotion of changing mulberry fields to plant miscellaneous grains has been advocated, the harvest is limited, and the product prices are low, and the farmers' difficulties are increasing day by day. For several months, there has been famine in various villages, and the starved people are everywhere. The elders of the various villages have witnessed the tragic situation, and they have discussed and mortgaged the old properties of the ancestral halls in various villages to wealthy families for cash, and distributed the cash to relieve the famine victims. Those who have implemented it are the Xinji Li clan in Beixiang, who have relieved 2 yuan per person to maintain the current food. In addition, the Long clan in Nanxiang, the Hu clan in Guizhouxiang, the Yang clan, Guan clan, Peng clan in Rongqixiang, the Long clan, Luo clan in Daliang, etc. are all in order to relieve the famine. Since the 23rd of last month, the number of famine victims receiving relief rice in Daliang Famine Relief Office has increased day by day. On the 25th, there were more than 13,000 people. The relief office temporarily built more than 20 feet of sunflower sheds to handle the relief affairs. In the past few days, 123680 and other districts have been waiting for relief in Daliang. There are no fewer than 5,000 people a day. The Chencun Relief Association in the county has recently set up a second distribution point in Zhengangxiang because of the increasing number of famine victims. In the past five days, 6,100 refugees have registered in Xinxu, and 8,200 refugees have registered in Jiuxu, totaling more than 14,000 famine victims. However, the financial resources of the rural clans are limited and it is difficult to maintain for a long time. It is still necessary for the local charities and the government to allocate funds to provide relief.</p>
<p>Zhongshan County was originally called a model county and was known for its wealth. The county's output is mainly rice, and the Xiaolan area is also a silk-producing area. Recently, the situation has changed greatly. Grain is cheap and hurts farmers, and the silk industry has plummeted. The rural economy has collapsed, and famine victims are everywhere in the districts. Zhongshan wealthy businessmen living in Hong Kong are concerned about the disaster victims. A Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce Relief Association was established in Hong Kong a few days ago to raise funds and purchase 5,000 bags of rice in Hong Kong. They were transported back to the county to hold emergency relief. On the 24th of last month, the first batch of 704 bags of relief rice were set up in Shiqi at the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce Relief Office, providing congee and selling rice at a low price. Congee and low-priced rice sales began on the 28th of last month. For the time being, 1,000 bags of relief rice were used for congee in various districts, and 3,400 bags of relief rice were used for low-priced rice sales in various districts. The number of famine victims in each district was checked, and the first district was about 15,000 people, the second district was 20,000 people, the third district was 50,000 people, the fourth district was 15,000 people, the seventh district was 15,000 people, and the ninth district was 50,000 people. Regarding congee, the distribution of relief rice in each district is as follows: 90 bags in the first district, 20 bags in the second district, 300 bags in the third district, 90 bags in the fourth district, 90 bags in the seventh district, and 300 bags in the ninth district, totaling 320,000 catties. The township office in each district will first investigate the number of famine victims in each district, and then hand over the relief rice to the township head for distribution. The amount of relief rice is the same for men, women, old and young. As for the low-priced rice sales, it is presided over by the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce. The allocation of low-priced rice per stone is estimated to be 306 bags in the first district, 408 bags in the second district, 1,000 bags in the third district, 306 bags in the fourth district, 306 bags in the seventh district, and 1,000 bags in the ninth district. The deadline for low-priced rice sales is one month. The township office in each district will first submit a letter reporting the number of famine victims in that place. Each time, the purchase of rice is only allowed to be enough for the famine victims to use for ten days, and no more can be purchased to avoid the latecomers being left out. Disaster victims who buy rice must first receive a low-priced rice voucher. The voucher states the amount of rice limited to each meal, and each person cannot exceed half a catty at a time, and each person is only allowed to buy two meals a day, and no more can be bought to limit it.

<p>The business group in Zhaolou Town, the sixth district, received a telephone report from the district office at dawn the day before yesterday, saying that the family of Qian Fukang, the head of the Fuda Township, had been robbed and injured. The robbers were fleeing north with stolen goods. Please quickly encircle and arrest them. The head of the mountain group, Xi Shinan, summoned all the members and divided them into groups to arrest them. At about 6 o'clock, three criminals, Li Chenshi, Zhu Decai, and Qian Xiupu, were intercepted at the Xinshi wharf in the town. One robber, Zhang Mouer, had already boarded a boat and escaped. He telephoned the Duhang Town business group to detain the boat when it passed through the area. All the stolen goods and murder weapons were seized on the spot. Yesterday, they were sent to the county. According to Li Chenshi and others, they were all from Taixing and used to work in Shanghai. They admitted to the robbery. The injured person, Qian Fukang, also appeared in court to identify them. It is reported that there were more than ten robbers in this case, and many of them are still at large.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wuxi: The Labor Strike at Zhenxin Mill is Becoming More Serious <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenxin Cotton Mill in Taibaodun, outside the West Gate of the city, had a go-slow strike on the 31st of last month due to unpaid wages. Later, through the efforts of the party and government officials and the public security authorities, and the mill manager, Jiang Zeqing, also asked Cai Jiansan, chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association, to represent him, he told the party and government officials that he would first pay the first installment of wages on the 5th. The rest would be paid off successively. The strike came to an end. The 1st was the mill's holiday. On the morning of the 2nd, the mill suddenly issued a notice saying that the mill would be temporarily suspended for internal repairs. The workers were afraid that the suspension of work would affect the livelihoods of all the workers, and they were shocked and angry. They went to Jiang Zeqing's residence in Shipixiang to question him. Because Jiang was sick and unable to walk, he was at Puren Hospital, so they went to Puren Hospital to surround him. The dean of the hospital, Li Kele, saw that the situation was tense and was afraid that something else would happen, so he urgently called the Public Security Bureau to send Inspector Wang and the chief of the first branch to suppress the situation. After finding out that Jiang Zeqing was indeed sick, he tried to persuade the workers to disperse and wait for mediation. Yesterday (the 3rd) morning, County Magistrate Wang invited Xu Chizi, executive member of the County Party Department, Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau, Cai Jiansan, chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association, and Hua Shaochun, the representative of labor and management, to jointly negotiate. However, at this time, the flower is expensive and the yarn is cheap, the money is tight, the internal management is difficult, and the external market is affected. The pain suffered by the factory cannot be easily solved. County Magistrate Wang invited Qian Sunqing, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the presidents of the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai to conduct thorough consultations at the Chamber of Commerce. There are thorough solutions, and it is not difficult to continue to start work.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Grain Merchants Collect Business Tax on Wheat on Behalf of the Bureau <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Business Tax Bureau of this county has recently received instructions from the Provincial Department that all grain merchants who purchase snacks on behalf of customers must collect temporary business tax on their behalf. Flour mills that have paid the general tax and purchase wheat raw materials in the place of production exclusively for the use of the mill are allowed to be tax-free if they do not engage in sales activities. If the flour mills entrust the grain merchants to purchase them indirectly on their behalf, the business tax should be paid by the grain merchants on their behalf. Director Xia has issued an order to the Rice Bean and Miscellaneous Grain Association to order the grain merchants to handle it.</p>

<p>Deng Shuren, a lawyer of Cotton Lane, South Gate, this county, went to the countryside from the city on business in the evening the day before yesterday. When he was near Jingxi Bridge on Jiangxi Road, he suddenly encountered three thugs who took out their pistols and blocked his way. He was robbed of 28 yuan. At the same time, Wang Wenbin and someone A were also searched and robbed. They were robbed of more than 50 yuan. Afterwards, they reported to the third branch of the Public Security Bureau, who immediately sent police to pursue the robbers, but they were not found. Also, Zhang Ruiyuan's watermelon boat in Xuewei Bridge and a certain family's civilian boat in ZhouTie Bridge were sailing in the Yangxi River in the fourth district when they suddenly encountered a pirate boat. More than a dozen robbers jumped out and looted the boats. The losses were still small.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Silk Market Improves, Silk Mills Go-Slow One After Another <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yichang Silk Mill in Nanqiao Town, the third district, started operations in May of this year, with a total of 256 silk machines. Wang Jiliang, the director of the mill, recently extended the working hours in order to speed up production because the silk market has improved. The wages were paid at 75% of the original rate, which caused dissatisfaction among the female workers in the entire mill. At 0:30 pm on the 2nd, they went on a go-slow strike. On the one hand, they sent representatives to the factory to request a reduction in working hours and to implement six in and six out (that is, work at 6 am and leave work at 6 pm). The wages must be paid in full and no discounts are allowed. As a result, the factory decided that the working hours would still be handled according to the past regulations, and the wages would be paid as usual. The workers were satisfied, so they resumed work yesterday (the 3rd) morning. Also, the Qianxin No. 1 and No. 2 mills in Gongyun Bridge and Beixin Bridge went on a go-slow strike because they changed to full-day work. After mediation, it was decided to do half-day work during this hot summer, and the strike was calmed down.</p>

<p>The tofu industry in this county suddenly went on strike on the 2nd. It is said that the purpose is to jointly discuss the price increase issue. Although the tofu industry is a small business, there are many people who eat it. The general public regards it as the only side dish. However, the industry has no organization. Recently, due to the high price of beans and the increased cost, it is difficult to maintain. Therefore, it is planned to organize an association this time, named Minxin Tang, and to negotiate and set the industry rules. After this, each board of tofu will be 560 yuan, each piece of tofu will be 20 yuan, each oil bubble will be 5 yuan, each page of tofu skin will be 50 yuan, and each piece of dried tofu will be 20 yuan. All stores must not differ. It is reported that it has been approved by the industry, and the strike will last for three days to facilitate reorganization. The resumption of business is approved from the 5th, but the general public has felt inconvenience in recent days.</p>

<p>The county government, upon receiving the provincial order to rectify the housing tax, convened a meeting of leaders from various agencies and groups on July 26th to discuss implementation methods, but no concrete results were achieved. Local groups continued to meet on the 31st at the county party headquarters, stating that: (1) the provincial order to implement the housing tax was for the purpose of funding public security expenses, but the county's public security expenses have long been levied on farmland, which is more than sufficient, surpassing neighboring counties significantly, making it unnecessary to implement a housing tax; (2) Nanxiang, a town in the county, has previously collected donations from shops for public welfare purposes, but this was voluntary and without a fixed tax rate, and it was abolished after July last year, so there is no housing tax now, making rectification unnecessary; (3) the county has suffered repeated major disasters and warfare, and the people's resources are strained and unable to bear additional burdens. It was decided to jointly petition the Ministry of Finance, the provincial government, the Provincial Department of Finance, and the Provincial Tax Supervisory Council through the Jiading and Nanxiang Chambers of Commerce, various trade guilds, and the County Education Association for exemption from the tax.</p>

<p>Although Sao Gou Mountain outside the West Gate of Yangzhou is close to both urban and rural areas, its remote location means few pedestrians in the afternoon, leading to frequent robberies. Today (the 2nd), at around 3:00 PM, Li Youchang, a farmer from Ganquan Mountain in the western countryside, who went to Shanghai for work due to the autumn famine, returned to the town yesterday (the 1st). He crossed the river to Guazhou in the morning and walked back. On the way, he met two people who claimed to be visiting relatives in Ganquan Mountain, so he joined them. Unexpectedly, when they reached a depression in Sao Gou Mountain, one person tightly hugged Li's waist while the other pointed a gun to silence him, taking all twenty-five silver dollars accumulated in Li's pocket. Seeing the gun, Li dared not shout or chase. The bandits fled back and reported to the city gate police at the West Gate, who reported it to the bureau. By the time the detective team was dispatched to investigate the scene, the perpetrators were long gone.</p>

<p>In Jiaxing, at around 2:00 PM on August 2nd, a Central Aviation School Yuzi 107 car was parked by the Xichun Bridge on North Avenue. Several soldiers from the Second Company of the Thirteenth Brigade of the Security Team passed by, argued with the driver that the car was blocking traffic, and assaulted him. A patrol officer, Xiang E, tried to stop both sides, but then Chen, an instructor from the aviation school, and Qi, the airfield director, questioned Xiang about everything. Afterwards, several soldiers from the security team stepped forward and beat the police officer, and a squad leader blocked the car's path. As a result, the patrol officers in the area, fearing trouble, dared not stand guard until 7:00 PM, when Chen Shaoqiu, the captain of the Third Brigade of the Security Team, sent an adjutant to apologize to the First Public Security Bureau and promised to have Zheng Yi, the Second Company commander, hand over the offending soldiers for legal action, settling the matter.

<p>The Ningbo money industry has recently been affected by the social and economic downturn, leading to the successive announcements of closure and liquidation of five major money shops: Datong, Xingyuan, Xinyuan, Taiyuan, and Yongsheng, as well as two smaller shops: Wuyuan and the current exchange shop, Hui Da. Unexpectedly, four more money shops, Hengmao, Xingyuan, Weikang, and Yankang, ran aground and closed shop the day before yesterday (the 1st). This is truly a misfortune for society. The Yin County government, considering the widespread rumors, specifically established measures yesterday to maintain stability, limiting depositors to withdrawals of no more than one hundred yuan, and publicized this widely, while also consulting with the Chamber of Commerce to discuss relief measures. The Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM today (the 2nd) to convene both the silver and money industries to discuss ways to maintain the market. However, with the onset of such a crisis, the entire situation is in turmoil, making it difficult to contain it immediately. Today (the 2nd), six more major money shops, Jingyuan, Huiyuan, Yuyuan, Yuanheng, Yufeng, and Ruiyu, have closed down and are undergoing liquidation. If effective relief measures are not devised in concert, the future of the local money industry is fraught with hidden reefs, leaving little room for optimism. For days, people have been restless. Deposits at the Bank of China have increased by more than two million yuan in the past two days, demonstrating the shift in power between money and banking.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Xu Shiying Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday and Makes a Statement: Currently Consulting with Shanghai Leaders to Plan Relief Efforts <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Commission, arrived in Shanghai by Jiang'an wheel at noon on the 2nd, arriving at the dock around 8 AM on the 3rd, and made the following statement:</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the people of Shanghai will economize on food and clothing.</p>
<p>I inspected the flood-stricken areas of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, departing from Shanghai on July 15th and returning to the capital on the 28th. All public reports have already been printed yesterday. All relief measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and handed over to the Ministries of Interior and Finance, the Department of Health, and the Relief Commission for review, with the Economic Commission also participating. Detailed content cannot be disclosed for the time being. However, the floods in the provinces are extremely severe. The Sixth and Seventh Administrative Inspectorate Districts of Hubei Province are even worse than in the 20th year. The people of Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan are still in deep water, and Tianmen is almost submerged, with the number of deaths estimated to be sixty to seventy percent. A total of 51 out of 70 counties in Hubei Province have been affected by the disaster. 37 out of 76 counties in Hunan Province have been affected, especially Xiangxi, Lixian, Linli, Shimen, Cili, and Anxiang counties. The remaining 49 out of 83 counties in Jiangxi and 13 out of 60 counties in Anhui are also disaster areas, affecting 14 million people. A small amount of relief funds cannot provide universal aid. Although Shanghai society is in extreme depression, I sincerely hope that everyone will economize on food and clothing and donate according to their ability. Our people have always been known throughout the world for their disaster relief, neighborly compassion, and kindness. In recent years, Shanghai has demonstrated this to the world and is leading the nation. This disaster is no less severe than before, and I hope that Shanghai will do even more to comfort the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Yellow River Disaster in a Week</p>
<p>Moreover, the five years of famine and the addition of the drought in the Yangtze River basin last year amidst the continuous floods show that the lack of human efforts in recent decades has reached its extreme. To avoid disasters in the future, we must think about fundamental water management. I have some ideas, which I have drafted into a memorial to the central government for consideration. As for the Yellow River flood, it has been reported to be extremely severe in recent days. After consulting with Shanghai authorities and leaders from all walks of life on relief efforts for a week, I will personally go to inspect the situation.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Committee Concurrently Handles Relief Commission Affairs</p>
<p>As for the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, it has been established and the permanent disaster relief reserve fund system can be realized. I am deeply gratified. The committee is ordered to be concurrently managed by the Relief Commission, and all staff members hold concurrent positions without any expenses or subsidies. In recent days, some people have been seeking employment, not understanding the situation.</p>

<p>The China Insurance Society, formerly known as the China Insurance Society, was previously reported to have been initiated. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held on the second floor of the Hua'an Building. Attendees included Song Hanzhang, Zhang Mingxin, and Ding Xuernong. Song Hanzhang was elected as the chairman of the meeting, and Luo Beichen was elected as the secretary. After the ritual, Luo reported on the preparations for the establishment of the China Insurance Society in Wuhan, the expansion of the solicitation of founders in Beijing and Shanghai, and the general overview of the preparations. The founders attending the meeting then resolved to accept the origins and articles of association passed by the founders in Wuhan as the origins and draft articles of association of the society. The meeting then officially began. After the chairman's speech, the articles of association were adopted in principle, and the name of the China Insurance Society was changed to the China Insurance Society. Its purpose is to study insurance theory and promote the insurance industry. The number of directors was also stipulated, and a formal election was held, but due to the late hour, the ballots could not be counted, and the meeting was adjourned after a photo was taken.</p>

<p>Around this morning, it may arrive at the Central News Agency. The Japanese aircraft "Qinghai" flew out of Hong Kong at 8:20 AM yesterday morning and landed in Xiamen at 10:30 AM. Due to the poor weather conditions, the pilot, A Ye, telegraphed the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, saying that he would fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). Unexpectedly, the climate improved in the afternoon. A Ye mustered his remaining courage and took off from Xiamen at 1:00 PM. It was originally scheduled to arrive at 6:00 PM, but it had not arrived as of 7:00 PM last night. It is estimated that the aircraft was forced to land due to bad weather en route, possibly between Wenzhou and Hangzhou. It is expected that it will arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Chen Lingyun, the special commissioner for tobacco prohibition of Zhejiang Province and the director-general of the provincial anti-drug association, has been urging the prohibition of tobacco in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Taiwan and other prefectures of the province. Over the past three years, he has achieved remarkable results. The Zhejiang provincial authorities, considering Chen's years of experience in handling social relief undertakings, passed a resolution at the provincial government committee meeting to send Chen to Europe and the United States to inspect social relief undertakings, hoping that he would adopt new methods from various countries upon his return to contribute to domestic relief undertakings. The Guowen News Agency reporter learned that Chen had arrived in Shanghai last night and stayed at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. He plans to visit leaders in Shanghai who are handling social relief undertakings to solicit their opinions again and will visit various relief agencies in Shanghai before setting sail on the Conte Verde on the afternoon of August 7th with the newly appointed minister to this country, Zhu Hexiang.</p>
<h3 id="e109">National Labor Representatives Wang Jinxia Returns Home and Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Advisor Wu Wentian Arrives on the Same Ship, Reports to Beijing Tonight <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Jinxia, the labor representative, and Wu Wentian, the advisor, who attended the 19th International Labor Conference, returned to Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde at 2:00 PM yesterday. The National Labor Conference was held in Geneva on June 4th and closed on the 25th. Except for the government representative, Li Pingheng, who remains in Geneva, the employer representatives, Wang Zhisheng and Zhang Hualian, went to the United States together to investigate industries, while Zhang Daomin and Gu Bingyuan also went to Germany and Italy together to study labor. Wang and Wu made the following remarks while still on board:</p>
<p>Conference Situation</p>
<p>More member countries attended this year's conference than in previous years, because the work of the Labor Bureau is valued by countries around the world. Furthermore, new member countries such as Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and the United States attended this year, and Egypt, a non-member country, also sent representatives to the conference and was allowed to attend as observers with the permission of the conference. The chairman of this year's conference was Mr. Clay Swart, the Minister of Labor of the Government of the Union of South Africa, and the vice-chairmen of the conference were Beck, the government representative of Norway, Mansier, the employer representative of Romania, and Huo Xia, the worker representative of France. The advancement of the conference affairs was assisted by ten major committees. The conference spent the first to fourth sessions busy electing the chairman and vice-chairmen, establishing committees, and electing committee members. It was not until the fifth session that the conference officially began discussions.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>The agenda of this year's conference was more extensive than in the past. For example, the issue of youth unemployment was particularly urgent, so the conference decided to adopt a single-level discussion system and produce a recommendation to be sent to the governments of member countries for reference. As for the issue of reducing working hours, it had been raised for discussion at the 17th and 18th conferences. Employers, with the exception of Italy, all tried their best to oppose it. When the conference discussed this issue, the attitude of the employers was the same as in the past, and the chairman of the employer group announced to the conference that the employer group refused to attend the committee in order to avoid detailed discussions on the issue. For a time, the atmosphere at the conference was extremely tense. In order to facilitate communication, the conference was adjourned for more than ten days. Our country's labor representatives were well aware of the domestic situation, so although they did not want employers to have a sense of threat, the employer representative, Wang Zhisheng, was also able to understand everything. After several debates, some draft conventions on reducing working hours were finally passed. Furthermore, issues such as prohibiting women from working underground in mines, maintaining the insurance benefits due to workers after relocation, and vested rights were all discussed and resulted in conventions to be sent to the governments of member countries for approval. The Convention on Limiting Working Hours in Coal Mines was also amended. As for the two issues of paid vacations and the recruitment of workers in colonies, only preliminary discussions were held this year, and the results remain to be determined by the next conference.</p>
<p>Approval of Conventions</p>
<p>The conference attaches great importance to whether the conventions approved by member countries are strictly enforced. The results of the review of the conventions that our country's government has already approved were deemed satisfactory by this conference. Countries such as Spain, on the other hand, were severely criticized. The committee of the conference that specializes in reviewing the implementation of conventions in various countries is called the Article 408 Committee, and its name is derived from its composition based on the provisions of Article 408 of the Treaty of Versailles. This year, Mr. Wu Wentian was appointed as one of the members of the committee.</p>
<p>Temporary Proposals</p>
<p>Although few temporary proposals were passed, they all had considerable value. However, the Asian Labor Advisory Conference (note: not the Asian Workers' Conference), which is closely related to our Asian workers, was presented with the unanimous support of our country's government and labor representatives. Furthermore, Bao Huaguo and Wu Wentian successively took the stage to give speeches, making every effort to promote the importance of the conference. However, due to insufficient voters during the vote, it failed to pass, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Opposing Dumping</p>
<p>A total of 159 representatives from the government, labor, and employer sides attended this year's conference, and a total of 255 advisors from the three sides. The qualifications of the representatives were questioned in the case of the worker representatives of Italy, Austria, Cuba, the Union of South Africa, and Bulgaria, and the qualifications of the labor advisors were also questioned in the case of Italy, Austria, and South Africa. Regarding the prevention of dumping, when discussing the report of the Director of the International Labor Office on this matter, the labor representative of our country spoke to the conference and raised this issue, saying that China's modern industry is relatively backward. Today, factories of all sizes are deeply harmed by the dumping policies of the great powers, which makes it impossible for them to maintain operations and puts them in a precarious situation. The serious unemployment problem is thus further exacerbated. Finally, he said that international forces should be used to stop such unfair actions. At the time, the listeners were all moved.</p>
<p>Factory Inspection</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of factory inspection in the concessions, government and labor representatives from various countries have spoken at the conference about its advantages and disadvantages. Later, a meeting was convened by the International Labor Office to specifically discuss this issue. Representatives from the relevant governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan attended. The atmosphere at the time was excellent, but continued efforts are still needed to achieve concrete results.</p>
<p>Reporting to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>The delegation from our country gave many speeches at the conference. Most of the materials were collected from various agencies and groups by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. However, the National Academic Advisory Committee (regarding the relief of youth unemployment), the China Branch of the International Labor Office, the Geneva International Library, the International Labor Office Library, and the League of Nations Library provided assistance in various ways, which is very commendable. However, the statistical materials were still insufficient, which is regrettable. It is reported that Wang and Wu are scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing tonight to report on everything. Wang Jinxia will soon return to Wuhan by transportation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Inspection Record of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway: 139 Kilometers in Total, Round Trip Takes 5.3 Hours <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway began, the project has progressed rapidly. The entire line, stretching 139 kilometers from Wuxi to the North Railway Station in Shanghai, is now complete. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 15th of this month at Guyi Garden in Nanxiang, and the highway will officially open for business on the 16th. Our reporter, recognizing the significant cultural and economic importance of this road to the Wuxi-Suzhou-Changzhou area, and aware of the general public's interest in the road's engineering, facilities, and sightseeing opportunities along the route, departed from Shanghai at 6:30 AM on the 2nd to inspect the entire route, returning to Shanghai at 8:30 PM. In addition to the daily round-trip schedules, fare rates for the entire line and branch lines, and regulations for attracting merchants to station services along the route, which were published in yesterday's newspaper, the reporter's observations are compiled below.</p>
<p>Solid Construction</p>
<p>The entire line, totaling 139 kilometers from Qujiang Road in Zhabei, Shanghai, to the northeast end of the Wuxi Railway Station, has a wide road surface and very solid construction. The road surface is paved with gravel, making it very smooth, and the ride is free from any bumping. However, there are quite a few bridges along the entire line. When crossing bridges, if the car's speed exceeds 40 yards, there is a slight bump. There are approximately two hundred and several tens of bridges along the entire line. After investigating the cause of the bumps when crossing bridges, it was found that it is actually due to the uneven connection between the road surface and the bridge at both ends. It is hoped that the company will find a way to improve this.</p>
<p>Itinerary Arrangement</p>
<p>If traveling from Shanghai by private car, it takes half an hour to reach Nanxiang. "When passing through Nanxiang, there are four roads for cars. The northernmost one leads to Nanxiang Town, the southernmost one leads to Nanxiang Railway Station, the road on the right in the middle is the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, and the one on the left is the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway." It takes only 15 minutes from Nanxiang to Jiading, and about 18 minutes from the West Gate of Jiading to the West Gate of Taicang. It takes 55 minutes from Taicang to Changshu. From Shanghai to Changshu is 95 kilometers, and the driving time is at most two hours. After arriving in Changshu, there are three roads: heading north directly reaches the South Gate of Changshu, a distance of one kilometer; heading south directly leads to Suzhou, a distance of 39 kilometers; heading west is the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, directly leading to Wuxi, a distance of 44 kilometers. The driving time is about 45 minutes, and you can directly reach the Wuxi Railway Station. Therefore, from Shanghai to Wuxi, if you do not stop along the way, the one-way travel time only takes 2 hours and 45 minutes, and the round trip takes only 5 hours and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Scenery Along the Way</p>
<p>The civilization and prosperity of the city ultimately cannot compare to the elegance and interest of the countryside. Therefore, after the reporter's car passed Zhenru Town, the flourishing agricultural produce on both sides, the green waves, made one feel refreshed and happy. There are many scenic spots along the way, but due to the short time, it was regrettable that there was no time to stop and visit Nanxiang, Jiading, Taicang, and other places. Upon reaching the South Gate of Changshu, having long admired the scenic beauty of Yushan Mountain, the reporter, along with Mr. Hu Bozhou, the pictorial editor of this newspaper, and Mr. Xu Tianzhang, the photographer, took a rickshaw to the southern foot of Yushan Mountain (rickshaw fare: one silver dollar), to a place called Shimei. There are several teahouses and restaurants there, as well as a Yushan Hotel, which is quite clean. The reporters hastily climbed the mountain, and after about 15 minutes, they reached Xin Feng Pavilion and Qian Yuan Palace at the top of the mountain (this is Yushan Mountain within the city, which is less than one percent of Yushan Mountain outside the city). Looking down from the pavilion, there is West Lake to the west and an ancient pagoda to the north. The dense population can be seen at a glance. They took photos together as a souvenir. After descending the mountain, they rested for a while at a Xin Teahouse, enjoyed some tea and snacks. The teahouse's facilities were quite good, with calligraphy, painting, musical instruments, and chess all available. The tea price was very cheap, only seven copper coins per serving. Next to the tea room was a lotus pond, where the lotus flowers were in full bloom, and the fragrance was refreshing. According to tea drinkers sitting nearby, no fewer than hundreds of local residents come here every day to drink tea and read newspapers, especially in the spring. However, Shanghai newspapers here are not delivered until after 2:00 PM, which feels very slow. It is expected that this will be improved after the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway opens. The reporters originally planned to visit the scenic spots outside the city, such as Yushan Sword Gate and West Lake. Sword Gate is the most famous scenic spot on Yushan Mountain, but it requires walking or taking a sedan, and it takes a lot of time to go back and forth, so they gave up. At 11:40 AM, they departed from the South Gate of Changshu. The lotus flowers on both sides were in full bloom, with red and white colors intertwined, forming a beautiful scene. The road surface from Changshu to Wuxi was wider. They arrived in Wuxi at 12:25 PM, refueled, and drove straight to Meiyuan Garden. After lunch at the Taihu Hotel, they visited Jin Garden, which is operated by the Rong family, next to Taihu Lake. The magnificence of Taihu Lake's shape and the beauty of its scenery are truly rare. It was a pity that they were limited by time and could not cross to Longtouzhu on the opposite side. They took several photos in Jin Garden and then returned. On the way back, they also visited Huishan Mountain and bought several clay toys. At 3:30 PM, they returned to Wuxi from Huishan and drove straight back. At 5:00 PM, they passed Changshu and took the Changshu-Suzhou Highway south. At 5:40 PM, they arrived in Suzhou and refueled again. They toured until 6:30 PM and then took the Suzhou-Shanghai Highway back to Shanghai. At 7:10 PM, they arrived in Kunshan. At 8:00 PM, they passed Nanxiang. At 8:30 PM, they arrived at the North Railway Station. In total, the driving time for this trip was about 6 hours and 15 minutes, and they used 19 gallons of gasoline.</p>
<p>Toll Collection</p>
<p>After the road officially opens, business cars traveling on this road and passing the Green Willow Bridge at the provincial and municipal boundary will still be charged a toll. The amount has not yet been determined, but private cars are exempt.</p>

<p>Resolution to Organize a Special Research Committee, Appointing Wang Yunwu, Cao Yunxiang, and Others as Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce convened its second committee meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Wang Yunwu, Wang Zhixin, Pan Xulun, Zhang Naiqi, Pan Yi, Gao Shiheng, Xi Yushu, Zhang Zitai, Sheng Zhuosan, Ge Jechen, Xu Caicheng (representing Jin Runyang), Guo Shun (representing Zheng Xiongzhu), Xu Xiaochu, Wang Yansong, Xu Jilun, Jin Zongcheng, Jin Guobao, Gu Xinyi, Hu Xiyuan, Ke Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, Chen Xiaodie, Ma Shaoquan, Xu Guanqun, Xu Peikun, Wu Hengru, Pan Yangyao, Cheng Yujie, Li Wenjie, Chen Guangfu (represented by Xi Yushu), Chen Zheqing, Yan Kuasheng, Yang Yinpu, Ma Jiliang, Huang Renzhi (represented by Ren Jinpin), Ren Jinpin, and more than thirty other people. Committee Chairman Wang Yansong presided over the meeting, stating briefly that the committee was established on the 8th of last month, and held its first committee meeting at the same time, passing a declaration and preliminary work procedures. The heads and deputy heads of each department immediately planned and proceeded in accordance with the declaration and procedures. The progress of the past three weeks is reported to the assembly separately: (1) Report on the process of the first reception of the press. The press has high expectations for this committee, and said that various social undertakings are deeply related because of the intangible connection of the economy. For example, the advertising and sales of newspapers are affected by the decline of industry and commerce, which is clear evidence. Helping wholeheartedly is their due responsibility. (2) Report on the process of the first reception of factory owners in various industries. (3) Report on the process of hiring consultant committee members. During the planning and implementation period, the heads and deputy heads of each group of this committee collected opinions from various experts, believing that if this committee wants to obtain perfect revival suggestions in the compilation of reports of various industries, in addition to collecting correct survey materials, it must invite experts from various industries and leaders from various industries who are enthusiastic and thoughtful to cooperate. Therefore, there is the act of hiring consultant committee members. (4) Xi Yushu, director of the investigation team, reported on the progress of today's reception of experts and leaders from various industries to discuss assisting in the investigation and solicit opinions. More than ten experts and leaders from various industries have been interviewed successively, all of whom expressed their approval of the steps formulated by this committee and were happy to assist, making the responsible person even more inspired. Nine industries, including the new medicine industry, the copper and iron machinery industry, the cosmetics industry, the silk weaving industry, the knitting industry, the cigarette industry, the manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industry, and the egg product factory industry, have started investigations separately. In the future, before this committee receives a resolution on a new mission, it will still proceed according to the first decision principle. The members of this committee are either leaders in the business community or financial experts with rich experience. Please give guidance at any time, and do your best to assist in the investigation. Because this matter is important and related to the progress of this committee, it will not be successful without concerted efforts. (5) Training Team Director Luo Qinghua reported on the progress of the first subgroup meeting. (6) General Affairs Director Yan Kuasheng reported on the process of distributing the credit small loan forms of the committee for the distribution of industrial and commercial loans. From July 29 to August 1, a total of 1,145 copies were issued. 610 copies were collected by the trade associations, and 535 copies were directly collected by factories and shops. After the report, the proposals of the members were discussed. Luo Qinghua, Xu Jilun, Chen Xiaodie, Xi Yushu, Gao Shiheng, Pan Yangyao, Hu Xiyuan, Chen Zheqing, Zhang Naiqi, Li Wenjie, and Yang Yinpu made speeches successively.

<h3 id="e114">Reviving Industry and Commerce: Self-Reliance Should Be Sought, Pan Yisan's Proposal to the Coal Industry Association <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Yisan, general manager of North China Coal Company, presented five proposals to the Coal Industry Association of this city yesterday, which are recorded as follows: Our industry and commerce have been in an economically difficult environment for nearly a year. Although each of us has endured hardships and faced the situation calmly, it is ultimately a temporary solution that can only support us for a while and cannot avoid the final result of stopping and closing down. If we investigate the cause in detail, although there are intricate and complex causes, the lack of bargaining chips and the outflow of silver have become the motive for the decline of industry and commerce. Therefore, the response is sluggish, the survivors are worried, and the trend of withdrawing savings deposits has started. The more intense this trend, the more the overall credit standing of industry and commerce collapses, which is the biggest main reason. Because of the collapse of credit, commercial goods are accumulated, and commodity prices plummet. As a result, the rich become poor, and the poor die, gradually heading towards the same end. The economic turnover is like a wheel that can be turned by a ring. How can a wheel with a flaw move? The only way to do it now is to recognize the meaning of coexistence and common prosperity to avoid the danger of the same end. Our industrialists and businessmen must seek their own ways to survive, so that they can continue their dying lives, and the way of self-seeking is nothing more than the self-reliance and regeneration of our industry and commerce. According to the industrial and commercial operations, there is its inherent self-reliance. The so-called self-reliance, in addition to capital, is the commercial credit between each other, and is based on the circulation of commercial goods. Following this principle to seek self-help, there are only three methods: controlling commercial goods, evaluating commodity prices, and generating credit instruments. If the control is successful, the economic capacity exists; if the commodity prices are stable, the self-reliance is solid; if the instruments are in circulation, the turnover is active. This is the way for industry and commerce to save themselves, and it is also possible. It is related to the survival of industry and commerce and the overall situation of our industry. Therefore, the following five methods are proposed, and I dare to ask the conference to make a decision: (1) Handle acceptance drafts (form instructions can be obtained from the City Chamber of Commerce). (2) Handle circulating pledges and fixed-term pledges (contact the City Chamber of Commerce Revival Committee). (3) Discuss and determine the evaluation regulations (stabilize commodity prices and protect the rights and interests of fellow traders). (4) Revise the industry regulations (clarify the rights and interests of our industry, correct malpractices, and promote the degree of revival of the industry). (5) Revise the articles of association (strictly clarify the procedures for joining the association and stabilize the business scope of fellow traders).</p>

<p>This year, the Yellow River breached its banks and the Yangtze River flooded, the disaster was extremely tragic, and the losses were particularly heavy. Overseas Chinese compatriots expressed their deep sympathy for this flood. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce remitted 20,000 yuan to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Bank last month to be handed over to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for proper relief to the Yellow River disaster victims. The money has been transferred to the Overseas Chinese Patriotic Donation Collection Office for collection and sent to the Relief Committee for proper distribution. Recently, the disaster-stricken areas in the country have expanded. Therefore, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce joined forces with local groups to organize a Fundraising Association for the Chinese Flood Disaster, so that huge sums of money can be raised for relief. Yesterday, another 20,000 yuan was remitted to the Shanghai HSBC Bank to be handed over to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for immediate relief. The original telegram to Chairman Chen is recorded as follows: Chen Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in Nanjing, I have received 20,000 yuan from the Shanghai HSBC Bank for immediate relief. Fundraising Association for the Chinese Flood Disaster by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and various groups. After hearing that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee had received the telegram, it replied with a telegram of encouragement and thanked the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Mr. Bao Bodu, director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' Municipal Garden and the Agricultural Experiment Field, went to Guangxi on August 1 to inspect the agricultural situation in order to gather ideas, strive to improve the business of the two fields, and promote the actual effect of rural revival.

<p>Although the Exchange Is Stipulated to Start in July, the Registration of Old Stamps Has Not Been Approved</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received the six articles of the Ministry of Finance's Measures for the Exchange of Old Stamps, it organized an office to start handling it. However, the second article of the exchange measures has the words "old stamp tax tickets that have been approved and registered." Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting the approval of the registration of old stamps in Shanghai as soon as possible in order to implement the exchange. The original telegram said: Nanjing Ministry of Finance, On July 27, the Ministry sent a telegram to the association issuing six articles of the Measures for the Exchange of Old Stamps. The association immediately gathered the old tickets, met with the members sent by the provincial bureau, and sealed them for safekeeping in accordance with the measures. It has sent a letter to the bureau, requesting it to send a member to the association to handle this procedure from August 1. Now, the bureau has replied that all 1,022 registration application forms from Shanghai merchants have been investigated, registered, and forwarded after meeting with the members of the Ministry, but no order has been received. The matter of jointly checking and sealing the old tickets should be handled in accordance with the second article of the Exchange Measures. After the order is approved, we will send a letter to notify you to do so. The registration of old stamps in Shanghai has been completed for more than half a year. I have heard that the measures issued by the Ministry can be exchanged from July, which is a comfort to the merchants. They originally intended to exchange for new tickets immediately, but they did not know that there were many twists and turns in the collection and verification. When can they exchange for new tickets? There is no definite date. The procedures for official offices are not understood by ordinary merchants, but they know that the Ministry can exchange them from July, but in reality it is still indefinite. They cannot avoid blaming the Chamber of Commerce for delaying. Now, even the meeting and verification procedures cannot be carried out because the provincial bureau has not received an order. This matter is even more distant and indefinite. The business community feels even more disappointed. Therefore, I will send another telegram to the Ministry, requesting that it be quickly approved, so that the provincial bureau can be notified to send personnel to meet and verify as soon as possible. This is a public feeling. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The general mobilization of river dredging in Shanghai County last year has completed the dredging of all the newly dredged rivers. The county government reported to the Jiangsu Construction Department and commissioned technicians Gu Xihou and Cai Baochang to come to the county for inspection and acceptance. After inspecting the seven rivers, including Tangchun Jing and Liulei Tang, the staff returned to the department and reported that they were generally able to meet the standards. However, the outer section of the East and West Jiagou at the Huangpu River was too shallow and blocked, and measures should be taken to dredge it as soon as possible to facilitate discharge and navigation. In addition, the section dredged outside the Yingdou River at the Huangpu River and a section near Tangzi Jing were still too shallow and blocked, and the original contractor should be ordered to dredge it in accordance with the plan. In addition, the bottom of the new river was too high to meet the regulations. For example, the West Jiagou was about 2 centimeters high, the North section of Zigang was about 3 centimeters high, the Sunjia Jing was about 2 centimeters high, and the X港 was about 1 to 3 centimeters high. After receiving the report, the department has ordered the Shanghai County Government to immediately supervise the implementation and report, and to pay attention to dredging at any time.</p>

<p>Yin Guangyu, representative of the Chinese Islamic Missionary Society, who last year represented the Society and Mr. Ma Junpu to travel abroad, perform the Hajj to Mecca, and investigate all cultural undertakings, has now been gone for ten months. Mr. Yin arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) aboard the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde." Those who went to welcome him included Ma Puqing and Su Zixiang, representatives of the Chinese Islamic Society; Ma Fuying, representative of the Chinese Islamic Cultural Association; more than twenty teachers and staff members from the Islamic Normal School; He Youren, representative of the Islamic Student Magazine; Yang Zhisan, representative of Dunhua Elementary School; Yang Yushu, representative of the Humanitarian Monthly; Da Peisheng, Imam of the Chuanxin Street Mosque; Ha Decheng, Imam of the Zhejiang Road Mosque; Mai Junshan, Imam of the Xiaoshadu Mosque; Ma Shaosheng, Li Yushu, and Ma Yifang, representatives of the Board of Directors of the Xiaoshadu Mosque; Ding Jingan, representative of the Hankou branch of the Chinese Islamic Association; and about a hundred of Mr. Yin's relatives and friends in Shanghai. They all braved the rain to welcome him at the Zhaoshang North Bund Wharf. After the ship docked, Mr. Yin disembarked and shook hands with each of the welcomers as a greeting. Mr. Yin checked into the Central Hotel and first went to the Zhejiang Road Mosque for a rest. According to Mr. Yin, he departed from Shanghai in October last year, first passing through Marseille, then arriving in Egypt, where he stayed for three months, before going to Hejaz (a country) to perform the Hajj to Mecca, and then to Jerusalem and other countries to investigate all cultural undertakings. After several months en route, he planned to return to China in June. However, due to the World Islamic Conference in Jerusalem sending representatives to tour and investigate Chinese culture, he was invited to accompany them. Furthermore, because the representatives' passport procedures were delayed, requiring a further three months of waiting, he decided to return to China alone. The various Islamic organizations in this city will hold a welcoming fire gathering next Sunday and invite Mr. Yin to give a public lecture. It is said that he will stay for more than ten days before returning to Taiyuan, Shanxi. (Yesterday's newspaper had a copperplate picture published.)</p>

<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang, the representative of the oriental symbolist school of drama and China's specialist opera performer, and Dr. Yu Shangyuan, professor at Yenching University and drama expert, were invited to perform in Russia this spring. Mr. Mei, together with Dr. Yu, then went to various countries in Central Europe to study theatrical arts, and returned to China from Italy aboard the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde." Yesterday afternoon, the two arrived in Shanghai. The ship docked at the Zhaoshang Bureau North Bund Wharf. Mayor Wu's representatives, Li Dachao, Qian Xinzhi, and Chen Zheqing, Mrs. Mei Lanfang, Fu Zhifang, and more than a hundred relatives and friends from Shanghai came to welcome them. Mr. Mei and Mr. Yu gave separate talks to reporters, discussing their journey in</p>
<p>Welcoming at the dock</p>
<p>The "Conte Verde" mail ship arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. It docked at the Zhaoshang North Bund Wharf. Those who went to welcome it yesterday included Mayor Wu's representatives, Li Dachao, Qian Xinzhi, and Chen Zheqing, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Shuyong, Mrs. Mei Lanfang, Fu Zhifang, and more than a hundred relatives and friends. After the ship docked, the welcomers boarded the ship to greet Mr. Mei. Although Mr. Mei was weary from his travels, having been in Russia and Europe for several months, he was still graceful and elegant as ever. Mr. Mei was very busy on the ship, greeting the welcomers</p>
<p>Circumstances of docking</p>
<p>When the ship had not yet docked, Mr. Mei and Dr. Yu Shangyuan stood side by side on the second deck, frequently looking at the shore with binoculars and waving to relatives and friends. When the ship stopped, Mr. Mei received the reporters who came to visit. Although he did not give any concrete talks, he said that he would send a written talk after landing and asked for guidance. He was very concerned about the domestic flood situation, saying that he and Dr. Yu Shangyuan had talked about it during the journey and that after a slight rest in Shanghai, he would respond to the requests of charitable organizations to perform and raise money to help the victims. Both were wearing beige suits, white drill trousers, and white hollowed-out shoes, and were in good spirits. Mr. Mei and Mr. Yu stood talking on the deck for a long time without getting tired. Then, at the request of the photographers from various newspapers, they took a group photo with the welcomers on the deck. In addition, they took a group photo with his wife, Fu Zhifang, and his sons and daughters as a souvenir before leaving the ship. At this time, hundreds of people were welcoming him on the dock, lining the streets to see him, and the traffic was blocked. He returned to his private residence on Rue Massenet at 3 p.m. to rest, while Yu Shangyuan temporarily stayed in a hotel.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's speech</p>
<p>I was invited by the Soviet Union's External Cultural Association, encouraged by our government authorities, and sponsored by the gentlemen of the Chinese Drama Association. I led the troupe to perform in Russia in February this spring. When I went abroad, I traveled with Ambassador Yan Junren on a special Soviet ship to Vladivostok. The Soviet Union assigned special personnel to take care of us, and the journey was very comfortable. Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Zhou Jianyun, who attended the Soviet Film Exhibition, also happened to be on the same boat, which added to the grandeur. I originally agreed to perform for eight days in Moscow and Leningrad. However, there were still many people who could not get tickets. After repeated requests from the Cultural Association, five more days were added in Leningrad. After returning to Moscow from Leningrad, I performed once again at the Moscow Grand Theatre as a farewell memento. In total, I performed for fifteen days. The TASS news agency reported to the world daily on all the performances at that time, and I heard that the domestic newspapers published them in great detail, so I will not repeat them here. I was very honored to receive unanimous praise from the people of that country and the Soviet dramatic leaders and literary experts for my performance in Russia. The major newspapers in Moscow and Leningrad recorded and commented on it daily, publishing it on the front pages. They mostly commented on the style and techniques of Chinese opera. To summarize the advantages of Chinese opera put forward by the people of that country, there are about three points: (1) Chinese opera includes "singing," "dialogue," "dancing," and "martial arts," which is a mixed art that integrates various skills. (2) The use of color lines on the Chinese stage is most in line with the principles of stage economy without losing its beauty. (3) Every move of a Chinese opera actor has a fixed style, which can be used freely in various scripts, and the actor's performing talent is not bound by this fixed style. The above points are what the Soviet literary and art circles pay special attention to in Chinese opera. However, in my opinion, I dare not make a final judgment on what Chinese opera is. However, taking this opportunity to get sincere comments from the leading figures in the theatrical circles of that country can serve as a reference for a new evaluation of Chinese opera. We were very warmly received by the Soviet Union during our trip to Russia. For example, for all performances, publicity, and receptions, they had detailed organizations, and we also received assistance from the officials of our embassy in Russia, so my colleagues and I felt very convenient. This is not only a personal benefit, but also a manifestation of the friendship between the two peoples. Mr. Ge Gongzhen was always the representative who contacted the Russian side. Mr. Ge has lived in the Soviet Union for a long time and is very familiar with the Soviet culture, so all the arrangements were even more thoughtful, which is heartwarming. As for our performances in the Soviet Union, we relied entirely on the strength of Mr. Zhang Pengchun and Mr. Yu Shangyuan. I should express my deep gratitude on the standpoint of national opera and on personal friendship. As for the dramatic situation in the Soviet Union, it cannot be described in a few words. The government's promotion is strong, and the people's interest is high. Under these circumstances, the Soviet drama is thriving and making rapid progress. According to the latest survey, there are more than 560 theaters in Russia, more than 47,000 actors and practitioners, and nearly 200 drama schools with more than 25,000 students. The future is indeed immeasurable. In addition to performing in the Soviet Union, I went to see plays almost all the time. I visited various theatrical organizations. After the work was done, I went to Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, England, Italy, and other places to travel, especially paying attention to the theatrical cause. Unfortunately, time was short, and I could not fully learn from them. In short, after visiting and traveling in Russia and Western European countries, I feel that Chinese opera should make special efforts. If Chinese opera is carefully selected and purified, it has its value of preservation and the path of advancement. I passed through Germany and Italy on this trip, and people in those countries hoped that I would lead a troupe to perform there in the short term. The British theater circles and diplomatic circles are particularly eager for this matter and have repeatedly contacted me. However, because of the different languages, texts, customs, and other things in various countries, the arrangement is more troublesome, so it cannot be decided in a short time. I have been with Mr. Xiong Shiyi in London for months. In the past two or three years, various countries have gradually recognized Chinese opera, and the play "Wang Baochuan" written by Mr. Xiong is especially popular. If there is an opportunity for Chinese opera to be performed in the future, it will surely be more welcomed by various countries. Before I went abroad this time, and after I arrived in the Soviet Union, I was deeply grateful for the warm reception given by the Soviet government and the diligent guidance of our embassy. At the opening of my performance in Russia, the Soviet government invited Ambassador Yan Junren to give a speech to the Soviet audience. It is generally recognized in the Soviet Union that this is the first time that a foreign ambassador has given a public speech to the Soviet people, which has greatly enhanced the friendship between the two countries. Ambassador Bao, the Soviet ambassador to China, also happened to be in Moscow at that time and was kindly introduced to me, which I especially appreciate. After arriving in Europe, I also received guidance from our embassies in various European countries, and I was able to study and discuss with theatrical experts from various countries, and I was able to visit theatrical affairs and organizations in various countries. When the ship passed through Singapore on its return voyage, I was greatly welcomed by Consul General Diao and the President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and I also went ashore to visit. When I passed through Shanghai, I was also treated generously by Mr. He Dong and his friends. All of this is what I will always remember in my heart.</p>
<p>Yu Shangyuan's talk</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Shangyuan, professor of art and drama expert, said that this trip to Russia with Mr. Mei Lanfang to perform our Chinese oriental symbolist drama art was well received in Russia. I am deeply grateful. Because Europeans have different understandings of oriental symbolist drama art due to different environments, their views will naturally be different. When we were in Russia, the critics of that country made many criticisms after watching the play, and we sincerely accepted them. When we went to Europe later, we saw the performance of "Wang Baochuan" in England. This kind of script is very well written, but the direction is inappropriate, so it is often inconsistent with the script during the performance. Moreover, Europeans have always valued realistic art, and their views on symbolist art are also different, so we still need to improve the performance of "Wang Baochuan." I will write an article about this trip to Europe to study theatrical arts when I have time to provide reference and research for the national theatrical arts community. I will stay in Shanghai for three or five days and then return to Beiping because the school's semester is about to begin, so I must return to Beiping as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Famous people cleanse the dust</p>
<p>Famous people in Shanghai, Li Shizeng, Qian Xinzhi, and Du Yuesheng, will hold a grand welcome party at the World Society on Avenue Foch tomorrow to cleanse the dust for Mr. Mei. Mr. Mei will also have to go to Beijing to report to the government on his performance in Russia this time. After the matter is completed, he will return to Shanghai. According to Mr. Mei, I received a telegram on the way, about performing to help the disaster relief. I will do my best to ask for help for the victims of the disaster in various provinces, because this is my duty.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Indian tycoon and philanthropist Vartan Mal, for the sake of business and health, led his wife and son to travel around the world. He arrived in Shanghai on the Chichibu Maru on Friday and will stay for about five weeks. Mr. Hua is a giant in the Indian silk industry, and his business extends to various parts of the East. He is now a member of the Khatra Hath City Council and is usually charitable. He has repeatedly donated large sums of money to Indian groups in Shanghai and other places. His visit to China aims to investigate the Chinese market and hopes to negotiate a method to increase the number of Chinese silk exports to India and to make Chinese products sell well in the Chinese market. For this reason, he stayed in Hong Kong and Guangzhou for three months and contacted Chinese and foreign merchants about everything. According to Mr. Hua, the US silver policy is a hindrance to commerce in the East, and China is suffering even more. He hopes that the United States will not hold on to this policy for a long time. Mr. Hua also mentioned the fall in the Japanese exchange rate and its impact on Indian trade. After leaving Shanghai, Mr. Hua will go to Japan to stay for two months to investigate the silk market there. Then he will go to the United States, which is his first visit to the United States. Mr. Hua visited Shanghai in 1917. Now he sees new buildings in Shanghai and the Bund area, which is even more magnificent. He was deeply surprised. When he arrived, a large number of Indians went to welcome him.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Indian silk merchant Vartan Mal told guests yesterday that the price of Japanese silk is already low, and the Japanese government is subsidizing its exporters, causing the Chinese silk industry to be completely destroyed. The Chinese government should now do what the Japanese government does, subsidize its exporters, exempt silk exports from taxes, and give subsidies to exporters. Otherwise, the Chinese silk export industry will never be revived. Mr. Hua plans to stay in China for a month and will meet with many government officials and business leaders to discuss ways to revitalize the silk industry. When asked if he was sure that Japanese raw silk and silk exporters were subsidized by the government, Mr. Hua replied that without subsidies, the price would not be so cheap. Mr. Hua is on a world trip and set off from Mumbai on February 18 and is expected to return to India in November 1936.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Municipal Finance Bureau Starts Collecting Autumn Property Tax <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that since the Municipal Finance Bureau implemented the method of collecting property taxes in the urban area this summer, the tax households have been enthusiastically paying at the tax collection offices. The bureau issued a notice yesterday that the autumn property tax for this year will be collected from August 1 and will be handled within the prescribed time limit. It is said that the bureau's tax collection offices are now further improving the procedures for collecting property taxes paid by themselves, striving for simplicity. After each tax record is paid, the receipt can be received within two minutes. If an immediate-term check of the Shanghai Bank is used, stating that the Finance Bureau will receive it, and two diagonal lines are drawn on the check, and the words "Collected by the Shanghai Municipal Bank" are written on it, and the post office directly sends it to the respective tax collection office for collection, it will be even simpler for the taxpayers, and it will be convenient for the citizens themselves in three ways: (1) If the words "Collected by the Shanghai Municipal Bank" are written between the two diagonal lines on the check, then the check is transferred to the disaster relief through the Shanghai Municipal Bank collection. Between one collection and one payment, the bank has already proved that the payment has been paid to the Finance Bureau for tax payment. Moreover, after the check is received, the tax collection offices will immediately send or send the property tax bill, so there is no worry that the payment will not be delivered safely. (2) It takes time to go back and forth to pay the tax. If the tax is paid using the above method, the trouble of trekking can be avoided. (3) If the tax is paid according to the above method, even if the check issued is lost on the way, it does not matter, because the check has been drawn with two diagonal lines, that is, it cannot be guaranteed and collected by the bank. Moreover, it is noted in the diagonal lines that it is collected by the Shanghai Municipal Bank, then the check cannot be paid unless it is signed and collected by the bank for transfer and relief. This is a foolproof method, and there is no need to worry about its loss or error. It is also said that when the bureau collected the summer property tax, because there were still a few tax households with more than ten yuan who did not pay the tax within the time limit, the bureau's tax collection offices sent people to collect the tax and charged a fine in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, after the autumn collection is opened this time, it will only take one or two days, and the tax households who pay the tax to the bureau's tax collection offices are more enthusiastic than the previous time, but there is no crowding, so the taxpayers all say it is convenient.</p>

<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that at 11:30 a.m. on the 2nd, a man was found unconscious behind the shrine of the Shanghai Shrine on Jiangwan Road. The shrine priest Tsurude suspected that he was a patient and immediately reported it to the Dixwell Road Police Station of the Public Works Bureau. The police sent him to Fumin Hospital. The diagnosis result was suicide by poison. It was found that the man was Ogihara Kunio, 38 years old, from Gunma Prefecture, Japan. He arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on July 29 and stayed at the Dongguan on Seward Road. He had only two yuan in his purse and a suicide note addressed to the Japanese Consul General, which roughly stated: "In recent years, I have been engaged in the silk business. Due to the social depression and the government's control, the industry has suffered failure. I have no choice but to commit suicide." After emergency treatment by Fumin Medical, there is no danger to his life. At the same time, the police station of the Consulate General specially sent staff to conduct a detailed interrogation and consider the aftermath.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Great Change in Ethics, Brother Kills His Brother, Forcing Him to Borrow Seven Yuan, Chops Him to Death, Disposes of the Body to Eliminate Traces <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>A Jiangbei stone boat, Public Works Bureau registration number 33995, owned by Gao Liqiao, 38 years old, from Funing, with a younger brother named Gao Liya (born to different mothers by the same father), 22 years old, who was by nature addicted to gambling and spent money without restraint. He had previously borrowed seven yuan from his brother Liqiao. On the day before, Liqiao asked Liya to return the seven yuan because the food in the boat was exhausted, in order to buy rice. As a result, a conflict occurred, and Liya was indeed chopped on the head by his brother with a sharp axe and died instantly. He disposed of the body in the Yuncao Creek in order to eliminate traces. This happened at 1 a.m. on the day before (2nd). Because it was late at night, no one noticed it. It was not until 1 p.m. that Chen Weisi (31 years old) and Gao Changheng (44 years old, both from Funing), crew members of the boat, secretly reported to the Wu Song Water Patrol Fourth Detachment of the Public Security Bureau, Captain Jiang Fuyuan. Captain Jiang heard the report. Because it was a serious murder case, he immediately sent Police Chief Zhang Kefeng, Police Officer Zhou Jiakun, Wu Jinyou and others to the boat to arrest the murderer Gao Liqiao, the deceased's wife Gao Wangshi (22 years old), and the crew member Gao Libiao (Sun and Tang cousins, 28 years old), and found a sharp axe, the murder weapon, and a cotton quilt stained with red blood, and took them all to the detachment. After Captain Jiang's interrogation, Gao Liqiao confessed that he asked his brother for seven yuan to buy rice. But Liya not only refused to return it, but also quarreled unreasonably and wanted to chop me with an axe. So I snatched the axe and chopped back, and chopped his head to death. The rest of his words were vague. Captain Jiang inquired about the cause of the incident. Because it was a murder case, he specially prepared a document and sent the police to send the murderer Gao Liqiao, his dead wife Gao Wangshi, and five men and women to the Shanghai Water Patrol General Team. After this incident, the boat gangs generally discussed that Gao Liqiao and his brother's wife Wangshi were suspected of adultery and murder, etc. However, whether it is true must be proved after the court's investigation. The body was found at the bridge pier of Yuncao Creek at 9 a.m. yesterday and was dragged to the Water Patrol Fourth Detachment. At the same time, it was reported to the local court to send someone to Song to examine it.</p>

<h3 id="e136">China Travel Service Organizes Tours, Providing Travel Opportunities for All Sectors and Benefits for Members <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, China Travel Service has been dedicated to serving travelers and has earned a distinguished reputation. In recent years, with the expansion of its business, it has established branches and hostels in major cities across the country, striving to benefit travelers in every possible way. The company has recently organized tour groups, widely recruiting members, with a far-reaching purpose. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tour Group Objectives: The company believes that travel is a noble form of entertainment that can enhance knowledge and strengthen the body. In Europe and America, people of all social classes have the opportunity to travel. However, in China, due to the underdeveloped transportation and relatively high costs of transportation and accommodation, the pleasure of travel is mostly enjoyed by the middle and upper classes, while ordinary people are often constrained by their financial resources. The company believes that to address this shortcoming, it is necessary to organize tour groups for group travel, using the most economical methods to enable ordinary people to enjoy the pleasures of travel. The company will carefully plan all aspects of transportation, accommodation, and meals to minimize costs while striving to ensure comfort and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Tour Group Regulations: Name: The group is named the China Travel Service Tour Group.

Welcome to join.</p>
<p>Travel Details: (1) All travel itineraries, accommodation, and meals for the tour will be planned and prepared by China Travel Service. Upon departure, the company will send staff to accompany the tour and take care of everything.

<h3 id="e137">Shengjing Steamer Raises Anchor, Unearthing Nameless Female Corpse Amidst Waves, Underbody Lacking Trousers, Seeming Severely Beaten, Diamond Ring, Watch, and Cash Found on Body <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, while the Swire Company's steamer "Shengjing" was raising anchor at the French Company's Pier No. 1 for departure, the water churned due to the paddle wheels' movement, and a nameless female corpse suddenly surfaced. The lower body was naked, the skin was not severely discolored, and the facial features were still very clear, suggesting death not long ago. Chinese Constable Duo, No. 42 of the Customs Water Police Station, retrieved the body. The detective chief of the police station's criminal division, suspecting foul play, examined the body on a sampan. The upper body was clad in a white voile short shirt over a striped calico shirt, but there were no trousers. The feet wore gray thread stockings and black serge shoes. The hair was in a bun. The deceased appeared to be about 27 or 28 years old, wearing a blue gemstone-inlaid earring in each ear and a gold-mounted diamond ring on the ring finger of her right hand, also wearing a gold watch. Sixteen five-yuan banknotes from the Bank of Communications, one five-yuan banknote from the Industrial Bank, three ten-yuan banknotes from the Industrial Bank, one one-yuan banknote from the Silver Industry Bank, three one-yuan banknotes from the Bank of Communications and Commerce, two one-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China, three twenty-cent coins, two ten-cent coins, and sixteen cents in small foreign currency were found in her waist pocket, indicating considerable wealth. A cursory examination of the body revealed slight swelling, but there was redness on the buttocks, suggesting severe beating. Other than that, there were no obvious injuries. The cause of death was suspected to be murder. However, the gold jewelry and cash were not taken, which presented an interesting puzzle. Since the body was discovered near the French Concession, the detective chief felt a joint investigation was necessary and notified the French Concession police station in the evening, requesting them to send personnel to investigate and handle the case. The water police dispatched detectives to investigate thoroughly that night. The body was sent to the Salvation Bureau morgue for examination, and the local court was notified for further inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Manufacturing Red Pills Causes Feud, Fellow Apprentice Commits Murder, Feng Muqing Treated at Hospital, Qian Shanhai Arrested Upon Return to Shanghai <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Feng Muqing, a thirty-year-old local resident of No. 130, Liu Lane, Makchi Road, Julaiqi Road, French Concession, and Qian Shanhai, an eighteen-year-old local resident from Longhua, Xixiang, were originally distant relatives and fellow apprentices. Their elders, both surnamed Gu, considered them brothers. Feng and Qian were partners in manufacturing red pills, which led to a feud and animosity between them. On the morning of June 18th this year at 6:30 AM, Qian Shanhai gathered five or six fellow gang members, armed with axes, and stormed Feng's house. While a maid was emptying a chamber pot, Qian and the others rushed in, went straight to Feng's bedroom, and, without any explanation, attacked Feng, who was still asleep in bed, striking his legs twelve times with the axes. They also left a threatening letter before fleeing. The threatening letter stated that the attack was a warning, and that if the police were notified, they would return to take Feng's life. To avoid further trouble, Feng Muqing did not report the incident to the police and sought treatment at the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. On the 28th of last month, Feng received another threatening letter while in the hospital. The hospital authorities, upon discovering this, reported it to the French police, who dispatched Detective Bu Zhenglong to inquire about the incident and begin investigating the assailant. It was discovered that Qian Shanhai had returned to Shanghai and was hiding in Room 12 of the Haitong Inn at No. 11, Lane 15, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. At 1:00 AM on the 2nd, in conjunction with the Laozha Police Station, detectives went to the Haitong Inn and arrested Qian, bringing him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, stating that the defendant was arrested for attempted murder and that the Police Department had not yet completed its investigation. He requested a postponement to apprehend the accomplices and investigate the case thoroughly before formally prosecuting. Detective Bu Zhenglong then reported the details of the arrest. Qian Shanhai confessed that he had not committed murder, but had fought with Feng Muqing along with five others. He said that he was often treated poorly by Feng, so he went to injure him. He claimed that the others who went with him also had grievances against Feng. The detective also reported that the victim was recovering well in the hospital and would be discharged soon. After reviewing the confession, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to August 13th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>

<p>Ji Zhang, a thirty-nine-year-old woman from Yiting Township, earned a living by farming. Her husband was blind and stayed at home all day. Last month, while Ms. Ji was working in the fields, she was bitten in the leg by a rabid dog. Despite seeking treatment everywhere, the results were minimal. Her condition worsened, and local doctors were helpless. On the day before yesterday, she pleaded with her neighbor, Tong Hengchun, to accompany her to Shanghai for medical treatment. However, upon arriving at Dafang Lane near Xiaobeimen, Ms. Ji suddenly went mad, flailing her arms and legs and becoming mentally incoherent. Tong Hengchun was startled and tried to stop her, but she collapsed and rolled on the ground, dying shortly thereafter. The local police took Tong to the Laobeimen Police Station for questioning. Yesterday morning, they ordered Jiang Banyuang, the local head of the Ninth Ward, to report the incident to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu, accompanied by a forensic examiner, arrived at the scene, confirmed the death, and ordered Tong Hengchun to arrange for burial as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Jiang Jinmu, a twenty-seven-year-old carpenter from Ningbo residing at No. 158, Pushi Road, French Concession, and his wife, Jiang Wang, a thirty-year-old woman also from Ningbo, worked as a domestic helper. Recently, Jiang frequented the Tianyun Amusement Park on the roof of Wing On Company, where he had an affair with a teahouse girl. This was discovered by a rival, and a feud developed. Around 7:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, Jiang was sitting alone outside No. 158, Pushi Road, cooling off when a group of over ten thugs, armed with axes, attacked him without explanation, striking his body all over. Amidst the commotion, Jiang was struck over ten times in the head and waist, and fled. The assailants chased after him until patrolling Chinese constables No. 49 and No. 58 from the French Police Station arrived, helped to arrest Wang Haixi (27 years old), a native of Songjiang, and seized two axes from his hands. Mu Shiheng (28 years old), a native of Shandong, was also arrested as a suspect. The others scattered and fled. The police sent the injured Jiang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His injuries were severe and life-threatening. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the suspects to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Zhang Qianzuo presided over the hearing. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the defendants were arrested for attempted murder and that the Police Department had not yet completed its investigation, requesting a postponement to apprehend the accomplices and investigate the case further. The detective stated that the suspect had been struck with six axes and that his injuries were severe and life-threatening. He requested that a medical examiner be dispatched to Guangci Hospital to examine the injuries. Detective Lu Dongliang then reported the details of the incident and presented the two axes as evidence. Defendant Wang Haixi confessed that he was summoned by Sun Fugen from Liu Jixiang Road near Xieqiao at 4:00 PM the previous day, who gave him an axe and instructed him to commit the attack due to a dispute over a teahouse girl at Wing On Company. Mu Baoheng claimed that he lived at No. 178, Pushi Road, and was accidentally bumped into by the injured man, causing bloodstains on his shirt, but he denied participating in the attack. Constables No. 45 and No. 58 testified that they saw the victim fleeing with the first defendant chasing after him with an axe, so they arrested him. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to August 8th and ordered the defendants to be detained. The two axes were temporarily stored in the evidence room.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Opium Den Trade Association has received reports from its offices in the French Concession of Shanghai South, stating that recently, due to poor business, fellow businesses on Jumen Road and South Railway Station Road are seeking their own solutions to develop their businesses, leading to mutual competition and selling at low prices, disregarding public interest and disrupting trade regulations, causing shared losses. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council Police has illegally increased the opium den tax. Since June and July, five or six Chinese and foreign detectives have been dispatched to Yong'an Street's Rui Tai, Rui Da Yong, and Laobeimen's Heng He Xiang and Guang Da Ying Chang establishments several times a day, threatening to cut off water and electricity and impose heavy fines to coerce payment. The Association has repeatedly reported these situations to this newspaper and has dispatched Zhang Songji, the general affairs officer, to investigate separately. After verifying the facts, a request for assistance was submitted, but no results have been achieved. Yesterday, leaders of the industry in both districts were notified to convene meetings to discuss solutions and promote the sale of domestic cigarettes. The Nanshi meeting will be held today at 3:00 PM at the office at No. 427, Fumin Road, Daanmenkou, to discuss and resolve the issues. The French Concession meeting will be held tomorrow at 2:00 PM in the Association's auditorium at No. 487, Ningbo Road, to convene committees and group leaders to discuss rescue strategies.</p>

<p>The Great China Celluloid Factory tragedy has not been resolved after more than a month. Yesterday morning, more than fifty aggrieved family members, dressed in mourning clothes, petitioned at the home of Zhu Rutang, the chairman of the factory's board of directors, at No. 44, Hongqing Lane, Mette Hers Road, demanding a prompt resolution. The local police, fearing unrest among the family members, dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress and dissuade them, but to no avail. Disputes arose, and four family members, including Wang Qilin, Zhu Xiaomao, Xia Lvshi, and Ni Yangshi, were injured and taken to the Great China Factory to recover. After the incident, Jin Yu, the lawyer representing the factory, was sent by Du Yuesheng to mediate but was also unsuccessful. At 1:00 PM, he, together with Wei Weiqing, the lawyer representing the family members, accompanied representatives of the family members' support group and assured the aggrieved family members that a concrete response and generous compensation would be provided tomorrow (today), with Du Yuesheng guaranteeing security. The family members dispersed at 2:00 PM. The family members' self-reported case is scheduled for a continued hearing on the 6th. The reasons for the Municipal Council's decision not to prosecute the case will be submitted to the court for reference in the ruling.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3 id="e148">Reading Supplementary Statistical Materials of Shanghai Municipality Compiled in the 23rd Year of the Republic (1934) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Huopei</p>
<p>Following the Shanghai Municipal Local Association's compilation and printing of the "Shanghai Municipality Statistics" in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), it compiled and printed supplementary materials in the 23rd year, following the previous compilation. It still covers areas like land, population, administration, judiciary, finance, banking, commerce, industry, labor, transportation, public utilities, cultural affairs, education, society, and health. However, the agriculture section is temporarily omitted because a field survey was just conducted, and only a year has passed. Most of the materials are supplemented up to the 22nd year, with some supplemented up to the 23rd year.</p>
<p>The total value of real estate transactions in Shanghai was 84.52 million yuan in the 19th year of the Republic (1930) (originally silver taels converted at a 1.4 discount, the same below), 183.4 million yuan in the 20th year (1931), 24.85 million yuan in the 21st year (1932), and 43.09 million yuan in the 22nd year (1933). The 22nd year was only slightly better than the year of the "January 28th Incident" (1932) in Shanghai. Compared to the most prosperous year, the 20th year, it was less than a quarter. The total construction value of the city in the 22nd year was only over 72 million yuan. Compared to the most prosperous year, the 19th year, with 110 million yuan (silver taels converted at a 0.4 discount), it was less than three-quarters.</p>
<p>The city's population, however, increased. In the 19th year, it was 3,144,805 people. In the 20th year, it increased to 3,307,432 people. In the 21st year, it decreased to 3,133,712 people. In the 22nd year, it increased again to 3,223,8628 people.</p>
<p>There were a total of 110,675 school-age children in Shanghai, of which 55,836 were enrolled in school, accounting for 50.44%.</p>
<p>The total operating expenditure of the Shanghai Municipal Government's medical institutions under various bureaus in the 17th year (1928) was 4,146,538 yuan, and the income was 4,834,991 yuan. In the 18th year (1929), the operating expenditure was 5,345,196 yuan, and the income was 5,866,092 yuan. In the 19th year, the operating expenditure was 6,344,734 yuan, and the income was 7,310,985 yuan. In the 20th year, the operating expenditure was 6,998,215 yuan, and the income was 7,737,284 yuan. In the 21st year, the expenditure is unknown, but the income was 8,789,984 yuan. Both income and expenditure increased every year. The Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council's regular expenditure in the 21st year was 16,465,291 taels, and the income was 15,169,553 taels, with income insufficient to cover expenditure. In the 22nd year, the regular expenditure was 17,125,657 taels, and the income was 15,800,983 taels, with income also insufficient to cover expenditure. The French Concession's Municipal Council's regular expenditure in the 21st year was 5,680,698 taels, and the income was 6,038,521 taels. In the same year, the temporary expenditure was 1,021,815 taels, and the income was 3,528,400 taels, with income exceeding expenditure.</p>
<p>In the 21st year, the Jianghai Customs imported over 54.02 million taels of silver and exported over 29.2 million taels, indicating that imports were still greater than exports. In the 22nd year, imports were over 75.75 million taels and exports were over 85.15 million taels, indicating that exports were greater than imports.</p>
<p>In the 21st year, the Jianghai Customs' import value was over 755.16 million yuan, and the export value was over 246.66 million yuan. In the 22nd year, imports were over 736.21 million yuan, and exports were over 315.75 million yuan. In the 23rd year, imports were over 600.48 million yuan, and exports were over 271.3 million yuan. Exports were less than imports, with a difference of two to three times.</p>
<p>Among the important imported commodities, cotton, rice, wheat, flour, paper, and cotton cloth all decreased year by year. For tobacco and machinery, the total value in the 23rd year was lower than the average price in the 21st year, but slightly higher than in the 22nd year. The import value of steel, wood, kerosene, and gasoline was highest in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Among the important exported commodities, tea and beans were the only categories with gradually increasing value each year. From the 21st to the 23rd year, tea increased from over 28.19 million yuan to over 30.32 million yuan. Beans increased from over 2.69 million yuan to over 4.4 million yuan. Leather also showed improvement. Eggs decreased year by year. The most disheartening was silk, which went from over 44.94 million yuan in the 21st year to over 4.25 million yuan in the 22nd year, and then plummeted to over 24.79 million yuan in the 23rd year.</p>
<p>Shanghai's wholesale price index was 112.4 in the 21st year and 103.4 in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Shanghai had 61 silk filatures with over 15,000 reeling machines in the 22nd year. Compared to 112 factories with over 25,000 reeling machines in the 21st year, the decrease was almost half.</p>
<p>Taking the 15th year of the Republic (1926) as the base of 100%, the Shanghai workers' cost of living index in the 21st year for clothing, food, housing, fuel, and miscellaneous items was 108.05%. The purchasing power of silver dollars was 92.55%. In the 22nd year, the total index was 97.17%, and the purchasing power of silver dollars was 102.91%.</p>
<p>Shanghai's total postal statistics showed that there were over 19,597,000 letters in the 21st year, which increased sharply to over 32,785,000 letters in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>The number of public and private schools at all levels in Shanghai in the 22nd academic year was 967, with 185,661 students and over 12.86 million yuan in funding. Compared to the 20th academic year, all aspects showed progress.</p>
<p>Shanghai's statistics on suicides showed that there were a total of 1,946 suicides (male and female) in the 22nd year. Those who committed suicide due to quarrels were the most numerous, totaling 787, accounting for 40.44%. Family problems were next, with 406 people, accounting for 2.086%. Economic oppression was third, with 389 people, accounting for 20%. This was 570 more people than in the 21st year.</p>
<p>Shanghai's statistics on divorces showed that there were 503 cases in the 22nd year. Among them, incompatibility was the most common reason, with 452 cases, accounting for 89.86%. This was 88 more cases than in the 21st year.</p>
<p>In the 22nd year, there were 256 robbery cases in Shanghai, 29 more than in the 21st year. There were 18 kidnapping cases, 3 fewer than in the 21st year.</p>
<p>There were 126 assassination cases in Shanghai in the 22nd year, 26 more than in the 21st year.</p>
<p>Shanghai's death rate per thousand people in the 22nd year was 8.65%, slightly higher than in the 21st year, but significantly lower than in other years. The death rate per thousand Chinese residents in the International Settlement was 17.6% in the 21st year, slightly higher than before. In the 22nd year, it was 12.8%, significantly lower than before.</p>
<p>The source of the materials used in this book is noted at the end of the table, as in the previous edition. Although the above listed items only offer a glimpse, a slight examination of the economic situation is sufficient to indicate that Shanghai's economic downturn has reached a serious level. Furthermore, the increasing population reflects the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the interior. Reflecting on the past and thinking about the future, one cannot help but feel deeply concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Police in the International Settlement Solve Robbery Case in Three Hours; Robbers Steal Over a Hundred Watches to Divide the Loot Somewhere; Two Robbers Arrested While Pawning Watches <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Li Yongchang Clock Shop at 477 Fuzhou Road was suddenly broken into by four robbers at 7:10 PM the night before. Two robbers pulled out handguns and threatened those present, stealing 480 yuan in cash and 135 watches of various types, worth over 1,800 yuan in total, and fled with the loot. Afterwards, the shop owner reported to the police and requested an investigation. The police notified all precincts to be on the lookout. Unexpectedly, in less than three hours, the case was solved by Detective Shang Wu and Investigator Shen Dehui of the Police in the International Settlement. After the robbery, the thieves went somewhere to divide the loot. Two of the robbers, Fan Shengliang and Zhang Afu, hid five of the stolen watches and took them to Lifeng Pawnshop at 271 Kaifeng Road around 10 PM the night before to pawn them for cash. They were spotted by Detective Shang and others, who suspected their behavior and arrested Fan and Zhang. They seized five watches and four pawn tickets and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, saying that because the time was too short, a detailed investigation could not be carried out, and requested permission to detain them. Judge Wu Zehan questioned the two defendants and allowed them to be detained for further review in seven days.</p>

<p>Divided into Groups A, B, and C</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tennis Club's open singles tournament passed the regulations through the club committee yesterday. Because the tennis players participating in the National Games arrived in Shanghai late, the registration deadline for Group A singles has been extended to August 28th, and the competition will start on September 1st. However, the registration deadline for Group B and C singles will be at 12:00 noon on August 15th, and the competition will start on Saturday, August 17th. Those who aspire to win the championship silver cup donated by Nanyang Tobacco Company should join as soon as possible. Registration fees are accepted by mail and can be contacted at the Shanghai Tennis Club on Kangdi Road (telephone 82387) or Mr. Chen Qihao at Xiangmao Foreign Firm on Guangdong Road. The regulations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This competition is limited to Chinese citizens, who must pay a membership fee. Group A is 4 yuan per person, Group B is 3 yuan per person, and Group C is 3 yuan per person. The court will be provided by the club (members of the club will receive a 1 yuan discount from the original membership fee).</p>
<p>(2) Registration dates for Groups B and C are from August 5th to August 15th. The deadline for Group A is August 28th.</p>
<p>(3) Players are divided into Groups A, B, and C, based on their tennis skills. The club will determine their level based on their past performance. Once the level is determined, if a player has an objection, they must submit a written statement with reasons, and the committee will re-determine it. The committee's decision is final and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>(4) The competition order will be arranged by the club. The competition period for Group A is from September 1st to the end of September. The competition period for Group B is from August 17th to September 15th. The competition period for Group C is from August 15th to September 15th.</p>
<p>(5) Players must specify the date of participation when registering, which will be arranged by the club. Absence once will be considered a forfeiture (if both players agree to reschedule, they are free to do so, but the court used after the deadline must be approved by the club, otherwise they must find another court).</p>
<p>(6) The club will donate a silver cup for each group champion on behalf of Nanyang Tobacco Company. A silver cup will also be awarded to each group runner-up as a souvenir.</p>
<p>(7) Players participating in the competition must bear the cost of three "Slazenger" new balls for 1935 (Editor's note: This shows a lack of industrial and commercial revitalization. Players must pay a registration fee of four yuan or three yuan each, so the balls used for the competition should be provided by the club. At the very least, the two players in the match should share the cost of the balls used).</p>
<p>(8) The competition rules are based on the regulations of the British Lawn Tennis Association, and the trust referee system is adopted. Referees will be invited to supervise the finals.</p>
<p>(9) In the event of a protest, a formal protest letter must be submitted to the Honorary Secretary's Office within 24 hours after the incident for the committee to review. The committee's decision is final and cannot be protested. A protest deposit of 5 yuan must be paid for each protest. If the protest is valid, it will be refunded afterwards; otherwise, it will be confiscated.</p>
<p>(10) Matters not covered in these rules may be amended by the club at any time.</p>

<p>Result: 5 to 3</p>
<p>The match between the Rikkyo University Table Tennis Team of Japan and the Shanghai United Team was held in the Central Auditorium under the watchful eyes of the public. As a result, the Shanghai United Team won against Rikkyo with a score of five to three, which was very commendable and a boost for Chinese people. In particular, Chen Zhensheng's victory over Tangomiya, who had won repeatedly, was the most watched game of the entire event. However, in the match between the Shanghai United Team captain Lu Zhongqiu and Horikawa, Lu had won three times out of three. On the night of the match, the electric lights suddenly went out. Lu maintained order with enthusiasm, resulting in exhaustion and hasty battle, and was defeated by Horikawa. This was not due to negligence in skill. As for Deng Guofu's match against Rikkyo's main player Ishibashi, Deng had just recovered from a long illness and had not yet fully recovered his health. The performance was thrilling. Although he lost to Ishibashi with a score of two to three, the defeat was also an honor. The results of the night before are attached below:</p>

<p>China Wins Against Railway... 15 to 0</p>
<p>The Railway team was the champion of the first and third Xianfang Cup competitions, and the runner-up of the fourth, with a strong team known as the "Iron Army". Unfortunately, Guo Qida did not participate due to the distance, and Chen Naixin was absent due to illness, which had a significant impact. In the makeup game against China the other day, they suffered a complete defeat, which is truly regrettable. However, China is highly skilled and strong, and it is no exaggeration to say that they will definitely win the championship.</p>
<p>(1) Lin Shihua (China) defeats Xiong Daji (Railway) 6-1, 6-2, 6-1</p>

<p>China Wins Against Lingxing... 12 to 0</p>
<p>This was originally part of yesterday's game, but fortunately it was held earlier on July 29th, so it was not stopped by the rain. However, the third doubles match is still remaining, and both parties have agreed to postpone it until next week.</p>
<p>(1) Lin Shihua (China) defeats Cai Guoji (Lingxing) 6-4, 6-2, 6-1</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Dingzhao (China) defeats Jian Shuwen (Lingxing) 6-1, 6-2, 6-3</p>

Yesterday, it was reported that the Qingdao Sports Discussion Conference was planning to form an academic group under the National Sports Association, and the conference resolved to name it the Chinese Sports Association.

The spokesperson said that the names of the two associations are the same, and it is unknown whether they will merge in the future. At a time when sports academics are declining, efforts should be concentrated across the country to make achievements in sports academics.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Achievements of Daxia Business School</p>
<p>Daxia University's Business School has been operating for over ten years. Due to its conscientious management and perfect curriculum, all graduates have obtained suitable employment. Those serving in various positions are all competent and enjoy a good reputation. This spring, the Shanghai Bank of China recruited staff members. Over sixty graduates from various public and private business schools applied, and only five were selected. Three graduates from the school's Business School applied and were all accepted, with the first place also going to a graduate of the school. Recently, the General Administration of the Bank of China held another recruitment for staff members. Over one hundred people applied, and only over ten were selected. Wang Yanfan, a graduate of the school, once again won the championship. This is sufficient to get a glimpse of the achievements of the school's Business School. It is known that the current dean of the school, Mr. Tang Wen-kai, is enthusiastic in his work and spares no effort in improving the school's affairs. The future development of the school is certainly promising.</p>
<p>Improvement Plan for Zhengfeng Middle School</p>
<p>Zhengfeng Middle School in this city has a history of over ten years since its founding. At the beginning of this summer vacation, the former Principal Huang resigned from both his positions as school director and principal because he was serving in the Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner's Office and could not attend to school affairs. After deliberation at the school's third board of directors meeting, his resignation was approved, and school director Wu Kaixian was elected as chairman, and school director Hu Changzhi succeeded as principal. It is known that Mr. Hu is an educational expert in our country with profound knowledge and experience. Since taking over, he has made many improvements in school affairs. Yesterday, Principal Hu also published an outline of the school affairs improvement plan he drafted, adding the following:</p>
<p>First, Regarding Material Construction: Shanghai is an area where Chinese and foreign cultures converge, with frequent transportation and a gathering of talent. Young people studying here can cultivate flexible hands and brains, and can observe and feel the path to progress. However, the poor air quality and extravagant living of the residents are its major drawbacks. The school's location is near Xujiahui, adjacent to the National Chiao Tung University's School of Taxation, which is both quiet and convenient for transportation. Judging from the above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages, all points occupy a good position. However, the limited school buildings restrict development. The school has now determined its budget and will first requisition vacant land in the vicinity of more than twenty acres in area during this year, using one-half for sports grounds, and building a tuberculosis sanatorium and a trachoma student isolation room for students to exercise and strengthen their bodies. The remaining vacant land will be used to build a Zhengfeng Library, which will move the existing school library into it, and add 5,000 new books, with a reading room attached to assist students in extracurricular study. This project will be completed in about three or four months and will be available for use in the twenty-fifth year. After the start of the first semester of the twenty-fifth year, two three-story student dormitories and a three-story teaching and office building will be built on the remaining land, which is expected to be completed in six months. By the start of the second semester, the existing school buildings can be completely moved in. Even if the number of students increases in the future, there will be room for expansion.</p>
<p>Second, Regarding Psychological Construction: Spirit is the skeleton of a career, and psychology is the direction of action. Therefore, in addition to material construction, the school is also committed to psychological construction. Tracing back to the last hundred years, the Chinese nation has suffered from the invasion of foreign forces, and has been frustrated and defeated, and it is almost impossible to end the day. Secondary schools are an important stage in the educational process, and this cannot be ignored. The school's future plan is to have all teachers set an example and cultivate a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and progress, with a clear understanding of their abilities in everything they encounter, so they will not retreat, and with the ambition to do good, so they will not lag behind. However, the cultivation of this kind of academic spirit depends on the usual training, and it is determined that it cannot be achieved overnight. The most important aspect of training is excellent teachers, otherwise, the example will not be established and inspiration will be difficult to generate. Therefore, starting from the next semester, the school plans to follow this policy and invite famous teachers to take teaching positions, adhering to the educational principles of the Three Principles of the People, and providing beneficial guidance to students in all aspects of their lives as much as possible. Each grade will have a homeroom teacher under the direction of the Dean of Student Affairs, organizing a student life guidance committee to live and study with students, setting an example for students at all times and in all places. Over time, the effect of imperceptible influence can be achieved. In addition, the formulation of teaching affairs, curriculum progress, increasing experimental work, limiting student leave, and holding strict examinations are all discussed in the principal's improvement plan, but because the matters involve trivialities, they are not fully recorded here.</p>

<p>Weiyu Elementary School</p>
<p>The school is located at the east end of Route Pichon and Avenue Masenet. It was founded by Mr. Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Zou Bingwen, Jiang Wenyu, and others. The school buildings, equipment, teaching, and management are all distinctive. None of the graduates who applied to famous middle schools this time were unsuccessful. However, the number of admissions is extremely limited, and there is only one admission examination each year, accepting both boys and girls, and boarding is available. The current principal is Mr. Yang Weiyu, and the Director of Teaching is Ms. Shen Shijun. The admission examination is scheduled for the 20th of this month.</p>

The new board of directors held a meeting at the China Association at 6:00 PM yesterday, attended by Ou Yuanrang, Huang Bingsheng, Pei Fuheng, Cui Xilin, Li Diyun, and Qiu Hanping, to discuss several important issues.

<p>— Original by American author Louisa May Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"Have you seen Aunt Shu yet?" he asked, as if this were an important courtesy.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen anyone except you children; I'm waiting," Ned replied. "Did Uncle Lao send you here?" Xiaoqiao continued in a gentle and solemn tone.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lao sent me here."</p>
<p>"He is Uncle Lao; he always sends good children here."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this comment, Ned couldn't help but show a pleased and satisfied expression on his face, and smiled slightly, making his thin face seem very lovely. He didn't know what else to say, so the two looked at each other in silent agreement, until a little girl ran over with her doll. She looked a lot like Xiaoqiao, but not as tall, and had a redder, rounder face and a pair of blue eyes.</p>
<p>"This is my younger sister, named Xiaomei," Xiaoqiao said, as if introducing a rare and precious treasure.</p>
<p>The children nodded to each other: the little girl's face seemed to be full of joy, deeply showing two dimples, and then she said with affection:</p>
<p>"I hope you can stay. We have so much fun here; don't we, Xiaoqiao?"</p>
<p>"Of course, that's why Aunt Shu came to Meizhuang."</p>
<p>"This really seems like a very good place," Ned also joined in his opinion, feeling that he couldn't help but say a few words in front of these two amiable young people.</p>
<p>"This is the best place in the world; isn't it, Xiaoqiao?" Xiaomei said, she clearly considered her brother the most knowledgeable.</p>
<p>"No, I think Greenland, with its icebergs and sea lions, is even more interesting than here. But I also love Meizhuang, it is indeed a good place, and it's good to be able to live here," Xiaoqiao replied, he was at that time reading a book about Greenland. (Note 5) He was about to open that book to show Ned some of the illustrations and add some explanations, when suddenly the maid came back, nodded towards the door of the guest room, and said, "Okay; you can stay here."</p>
<p>"I'm so happy; let's go see Aunt Shu now." Xiaomei said, and took one of Ned's hands, looking like she was protecting him, which was so lovely that it immediately dispelled all of Ned's fear of unfamiliarity and loneliness.</p>

<p>Fan Xuan Loves His Body</p>
<p>When Fan Xuan was eight years old, he was picking vegetables in the backyard and accidentally injured his finger. He couldn't help but cry loudly. Someone asked him, "Is it because it hurts?" "No, it's only because I remembered that the book says, 'Our body, hair, and skin are received from our parents, and we dare not injure or damage them,' so I cried!" he replied.</p>
<p>Everyone's body is passed down from their parents and should serve society and the community. Everyone should protect their body and not injure it. The sentence quoted by Fan Xuan comes from the Classic of Filial Piety, which teaches people to value self-love as part of filial piety. In an extraordinary state, he was still able to remember the education he received from books, which is worthy of our respect and emulation.</p>
<p>Kong Rong's Eloquence</p>
<p>When Kong Rong was young, he sought an audience with a high-ranking official named Li. The official Li had a high position, and because there were too many guests visiting every day, he was unable to receive them all, so he instructed the gatekeeper that only relatives and old friends could be reported. Kong Rong had already heard of this practice, so he told the gatekeeper that he and the master's family had been friends for generations, and only then was he able to achieve his goal of meeting. Li Huan asked him, "You say that we have been friends for generations?" He immediately replied, "Isn't it so? Don't you remember the friendship between my family's sage and your family's Laozi?" The host was praising him to the skies when a guest sitting nearby interjected, "He's clever when he's young, but he may not be good when he's older!" Kong Rong turned around and replied, "I suppose you, sir, were definitely clever when you were young." The guest was immediately speechless.</p>
<p>There is a folk saying in Jiangnan, "Three years old determines eight years old, eight years old determines a lifetime." This means that observing a person's words and actions in their youth can reveal their entire life. Kong Rong's agile eloquence was a gift from heaven and could not be forcibly learned through human effort. Ultimately, he became a famous official and Confucian scholar in the late Han Dynasty, which shows that the folk saying is correct.</p>

<p>Summer Morning</p>
<p>I circle around the lake, slowly paddling.</p>
<p>I love the newly blooming lotus flowers,</p>
<p>Like girls wearing little red shirts.</p>
<p>I love even more the morning dew on the lotus leaves,</p>

<p>Ah, jade, pearls,</p>

<h3 id="e160">Etiquette for Social Conversation (Civic Training) <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhai Husband</p>
<p>If one is not born mute, then speaking is a right endowed to us by nature.</p>
<p>Impetuous people, upon meeting strangers and exchanging brief greetings, launch into lengthy, detailed conversations. Those who are inarticulate, however, become timid upon meeting strangers and can't utter a single word. Both of these attitudes are somewhat inappropriate.</p>
<p>"Nature gave us two ears but only one mouth."</p>
<p>"No matter how foolish you are, people won't realize it if you don't open your mouth." These sayings are meant to warn people to be careful about what they say. On the other hand, "Only conversation can dispel a dull atmosphere; only conversation can bridge the gaps between us; and only conversation can harmonize estranged feelings."</p>
<p>When meeting a stranger for the first time, conversation must be calm and unhurried. Don't be impatient or quick-tongued. Speaking loudly, making grand pronouncements, and constantly chattering with those sitting near you without regard for others are all flaws that should be avoided.</p>
<p>"You're wrong!" "I don't think so." "Outrageous!" "Humph!" (exhaling through the nostrils) These impolite tones should be carefully avoided.</p>
<p>"Please forgive me." "I'm sorry." "I think that..." These humble tones can be used often.</p>
<p>When the other person is speaking animatedly, don't interrupt them.</p>
<p>When the other person shows signs of fatigue, don't bore them with endless chatter.</p>
<p>If the conversation isn't engaging, there's no need to talk much.</p>
<p>When angry or upset, try to restrain yourself from speaking.</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children's Year has begun! Min'er gathered the neighborhood children to hold a small music gathering to celebrate this happy Children's Year.</p>
<p>Min'er's father specially bought many candies to distribute to them. As soon as Min'er saw the candy, he took a lot for himself. His older brother, Cong'er, scolded him:</p>
<p>"Younger brother, you really don't know etiquette. You didn't distribute some to the neighborhood children first, but took so much for yourself. Weren't you complaining about a toothache yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Brother, yes, but sugar can help with digestion, so I want to eat more. It's fragrant and sweet, a win-win. Wouldn't it be silly not to eat it?" Min'er said, mumbling with sugar in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Eating a little can help with digestion; eating too much will cause stomach acid to build up, slowing down digestion. If sugar decomposes in your mouth, it will damage your teeth, which is why you often have toothaches."</p>
<p>"Didn't Mom say that rock sugar can cure coughs? Then I'll eat rock sugar."</p>
<p>"Rock sugar is still sugar, just a bit more refined. Eating too much is still not good."</p>
<p>"Oh! I won't eat too much sugar, but I don't know how it's made?"</p>
<p>"Sugar is made from sugarcane and beets. In our country, sugarcane is mostly used. In the morning, it's cut down, the skin is peeled off, and it's pressed in a stone roller. The squeezed juice is boiled in an iron pot, and the impurities that float to the top are gradually skimmed off. Lime is added, and after one or two hours, it's taken out and filtered through cloth. Then it's evaporated over a low flame until the juice is thick. It's placed in a cold pot and stirred constantly with a stick. When it's cooled to the right time, it's poured into a clay pot to crystallize, becoming brown sugar. Removing the molasses from brown sugar can make white sugar. Dissolving white sugar in water to make a concentrated liquid and placing it in a jar will gradually solidify into a semi-transparent solid, which is rock sugar."</p>
<p>"Sugarcane, can it be cultivated here?"</p>
<p>"Not here. Sugarcane likes to grow in warm places, so Guangdong and Fujian produce a lot."</p>
<p>"What kinds of sugarcane do we commonly see?"</p>
<p>"There are two kinds: the green-skinned one is called bamboo cane, and the red-skinned one is called Kunlun cane."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Soft Water and Hard Water (Common Sense) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>Children! Mr. Nature may have already told you? Water has ground water and underground water distinctions. What I'm going to talk about here is that soft water is ground water; hard water is underground water. Now, let's briefly analyze it like this:</p>
<p>Summer is a season that makes people sweat. Therefore, handkerchiefs and towels have become our daily necessities, but sometimes they slowly turn black and stiff; but some places handkerchiefs and towels, even when worn out, are still white and soft. This is not a relationship between sweat and handkerchief quality but a water problem. Also, some copper teapots, although used for a long time, are still very clean; some places will form a thick layer of dirt. This is also not related to the long-term use of copper. It is also a water problem. Furthermore: some places water can moisturize people's skin: but some places water will make people's skin rough. This is also a relationship between water. In short, anything that makes towels handkerchiefs turn black and harden; causes dirt on copper teapots! Causes rough skin are all related to water, and it is hard water rather than soft water.</p>
<p>Any water that does not contain mineral impurities is called soft water; water that contains such impurities is called hard water. Because this kind of impurity, if it undergoes a chemical reaction with other substances, other things will be harmed by it.</p>
<p>(1) Nitric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. contained in hard water erode soft cotton fabrics (such as handkerchiefs and towels), and their softness is reduced because of the deprivation of moisture, and they become black and hard because they absorb other mineral impurities.</p>
<p>(2) After hard water is boiled by fire, some mineral impurities will precipitate, causing dirt to accumulate, and at the same time, because the evaporated acid enters the essence, it is very easy to make it rot.</p>
<p>(3) Hard water erodes people's skin, then the fat will combine with the acid, which can make the skin rough.</p>
<p>Needless to say, well water and spring water flow underground, so they naturally contain more mineral impurities, so they are often hard water. Some of the tap water in Shanghai is also groundwater (like artesian wells), which must undergo extremely fine filtration and chemical processes to remove its hardness. However, some private artesian wells have simple equipment due to economic problems, so there is even more hard water, which we should pay attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e164">How to Correct Bad Reading Habits? (Talk) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Dear children, there are several bad reading habits. You usually overlook them when you are reading. Now I would like to bring them up and talk about them, hoping that you will all correct them.</p>
<p>The first bad habit is that you think you understand it a little bit, and that's it. This is not a big loss for general knowledge of Chinese, but it won't work for arithmetic! Because if you don't understand arithmetic from the beginning, you will become more and more confused later on! So when you are taking the exam, you are dumbfounded and can't do it, that is so sad!</p>
<p>The second bad habit is greed. You look at this book and flip through that book. As a result, you spend a lot of precious time and don't finish reading any of them.</p>
<p>The third bad habit is that you have no perseverance. You read when you are happy, and when you are not happy, you just play. How can you improve your reading then?</p>
<p>Children, to correct the first bad habit, you must first prepare a notebook, write down the unclear words and sentences, and ask your classmates or teachers. You must understand it before you stop! For the second bad habit, we must first pick a book and not flip through another book until we have finished reading this one. There is also the third bad habit: we must set a self-study schedule and develop the habit of reading regularly every day. This will not only solve the difficulties of exams, but also increase your interest in reading and gain advanced knowledge and learning.</p>
<p>Okay, I hope you children will work hard to correct your bad habits.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Summer Toys (Handicraft) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baozhang</p>
<p>Children! In addition to studying, we should also use our hands to create something! Not only does it feel very interesting, but it also shows our children's intelligence and wisdom. Wasn't the convenient transportation of steamboats and trains invented because Watt invented the lifting of kettle lids when he was a child? Wasn't the omnipotent electricity invented because Franklin invented flying kites when he was a child, and then one invention after another? Children, let's invent!</p>
<p>These days are the hot summer months. It is very interesting for our children to sit in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air, tell stories and jokes, and guess riddles. But, wouldn't it be even more interesting if our children could make a few more toys to play with?</p>
<p>(1) Watermelon Lantern　Take a round watermelon and scoop out the inside , everyone eats to cool off in summer. Draw some flowers and birds on the melon skin, write some words, and slowly carve away the green skin according to the traces of the calligraphy and painting. Insert a small nail at the bottom of the melon for lighting a candle. Tie ropes on the four corners and hang it in the courtyard. When the candle is lit at night, the flowers and birds look lifelike from a distance, and the green light shines in all directions, isn't it very beautiful? If you imitate the method of making a carousel lantern, draw five or six shadow figures and attach them to the bottom of the paper wheel, pass an axis through the wheel and insert it into the melon. Once the candle is lit, the air next to the paper wheel moves due to heat, and cold air comes to fill the gap, creating wind that drives the paper wheel to spin. From a distance, the characters move as if they are alive, much like watching a movie, which is even more interesting.</p>
<p>(2) Lotus Lantern　Use bamboo strips to tie a lotus lantern and paste it with paper of red, green, yellow, white and other colors. Light a small candle inside. Or use clam shells, store vegetable oil and lamp wick in the middle, light it up and place it in the pond. Floating up and down, like countless twinkling stars, embellishing the water beautifully, it is very beautiful.</p>
<p>In addition, fold transparent paper into a firefly cage and catch a few fireflies and put them inside. The firefly light shines out, and it is also a good toy. After the summer month passes, a cool breeze slowly comes, and the autumn insects of Qu Qu Ji Ji are produced in time. This is a very happy season for us. Cricket cages, bell cricket cages, and grasshopper cages are also toys that children can make themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Children's Year Aspirations <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Heart Green</p>
<p>On this day, the breeze was gentle and the sun was bright. Although it was summer, it didn’t feel hot, just like the late spring weather when orioles fly and grasses grow. It was about six o'clock in the evening, and the setting sun gradually cast its rays on a small garden in the city. In the garden, two tall sycamore trees were golden as if coated with a layer of gold. Under the trees, on a patch of grass, several children sat in a circle. In front of them were many cakes, candies, paintings, calligraphy, and toys. They were talking, laughing, and very happy. It turned out that they were holding a celebratory gathering to mark the opening of Children's Year.</p>
<p>One of the older children stood up and said, "Everyone, Children's Year has begun! This year is of great significance to us children, and we must not let it pass lightly. Today's gathering should also be something meaningful. We can't just eat, play, talk, and laugh and think that's enough."</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone said in unison, "That's right, that's right, we should do something meaningful, but how are we going to do it? You are the chairman today, so please give us your opinion."</p>
<p>The chairman lowered his head and thought for a moment, then opened his mouth again and said, "Our teachers at school have said well: 'Everyone has aspirations. Everyone should set their aspirations when they are children, so that when they grow up, they can proceed according to their aspirations.' So, I thought that taking advantage of the opening day of Children's Year, everyone could talk about their future aspirations."</p>
<p>The children unanimously raised their hands and said, "Agreed! Agreed! But who should speak first?"</p>
<p>The chairman said, "Let's go in order of the number of strokes in our surnames, starting with the one with the fewest strokes."</p>
<p>So, a child surnamed Ding stood up and said, "My surname is Ding, with only two strokes, so let me speak first: My father is a comprador in a foreign firm. He earns thousands of dollars a month, wears Western suits every day, eats fancy meals, lives in a Western-style house, and rides in a car. Look how comfortable he is! So, when I grow up, I also want to be like my father and become a comprador in a foreign firm."</p>
<p>Next, a child surnamed Wang stood up and said, "My surname is Wang, with only four strokes, so let me speak second: My uncle is a great lawyer. He is very famous and earns a lot of money. Even though he doesn't work as a comprador in a foreign firm, he still lives in a Western-style house and rides in a car, so I want to be a great lawyer in the future."</p>
<p>Next, a child surnamed Bao stood up and said, "My surname is Bao, with only five strokes, so let me speak third: My uncle is a county magistrate. He manages a county of hundreds of miles, and the local people call him 'County Lord.' He is in charge of everything in the area. His status is high, and his income is also high. I think being an official is better than anything else, so I want to be an official in the future."</p>
<p>Next, a child surnamed Ren stood up and said, "What's so rare about being a county magistrate? Being a military officer is better than being a civil official. Don't you see my uncle? He is a division commander in the army, with tens of thousands of soldiers under his command. Whether it's the battalion commander, regiment commander, or brigade commander, they all have to listen to his orders. How imposing that is! So, my aspiration is to be a division commander in the future."</p>
<p>Next, a child surnamed Li stood up and said, "Your aspirations are not my aspirations. At school, I like Chinese and drawing the most. My grades are always above ninety points every semester. According to my father, if I study hard, I can become a writer and artist in the future. As long as I have the skills, I can still earn a lot of money. Besides, my reputation will be great, and my status will be high, so I have already decided on my aspiration."</p>
<p>Next, a child surnamed Hu stood up and said, "My aspiration is the highest. It's completely different from yours. What do you think it is? It turns out that I want to be an aviator. In the future, I can sit in an airplane and fly high in the sky, flying, flying, flying, and going wherever I want freely. How interesting that is! In case of war with other countries, I can also contribute to the country."</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman smiled, stood up, and said, "My surname is Chen, with the most strokes, so I have to be at the end. I dare not agree with any of your aspirations except for being an aviator. Since the beginning of this semester, after listening to the speeches of several teachers, I have aspired to science, because science can save the country. You must know that China is so poor and so weak because science is not developed. Science is very broad. Let's start with diligent study of zoology and botany. When we enter middle school, we will focus on physics and chemistry, and study step by step. In the future, it will be very useful. I plan to make a career in science. First, I want to invent some new items that are beneficial to the public, and then open mines to extract raw materials and open factories to manufacture them cheaply. Although this aspiration is great, I must strive to do it. I hope you will all strive to do the same and aspire to be scientists."</p>

<p>Commercial News: Central Bank Gold Bar Rates Announced; Gold Speculation Resurges</p>
<p>Outside the Market, it Once Broke the 900 Yuan Mark, Repeatedly Rising to 917 Yuan, Further Setting a New Increase of 10 Yuan and 6 Fen</p>
<p>The gold market was initially sluggish yesterday but then picked up, and the speculative trend showed no signs of stopping. Reports of economic experts' discussions had a slight impact on the market. However, due to an economic intelligence report from Shen Shi News Agency, which contained buying advice, some people anticipated buying opportunities. When the Central Bank announced the official rates, the upward trend began, breaking the 910 yuan mark and rising to 917 yuan several times. The strength of bullish sentiment was evident. Initially, overseas silver markets in the UK and US were stable, and Montevideo forward silver prices were unchanged or slightly lower (less than 1%). London spot gold rose by half a penny, and exchange rates were stable. In overnight trading, the market turned from firm to weak amid rumors of clarification, which slightly dampened sentiment. Economic expert Xu Peikun stated that under the current financial and industrial conditions, the government would not adopt inflationary policies, causing pre-market transactions to fall to 0.23 yuan, and sellers surged, pushing prices down to 898 yuan, below the 900 yuan mark. A report from Shen Shi News Agency stated that the National Goods Alliance would petition government leaders to reform the currency system, boosting some confidence. Some buyers maintained their positions at lower prices, and prices rebounded to 903 yuan at Da De Cheng, Heng Chang, Yong Qing, Fa Yong Fu, Yu Lai Jin. Fu Xing Yong moved in and out, becoming more stable. The morning opening was slightly lower, but after the Central Bank announced the rates, the UK and US both significantly tightened, and customs gold units rose by 2.5 fen. The standard gold bar price rose to 922.5 yuan, stimulating buying interest and breaking the 10 yuan mark, gradually rising. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing prices to fall. The HSBC announced rates, with the pound tightening by 0.25 and the US dollar tightening by 0.52625, with more pullback. However, due to the foreign exchange market fueling selling pressure, prices fell below the 10 yuan mark. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, and Chinese merchants still made slight purchases. Large investors bought on margin at lower prices, but prices were soon pushed up, tightening the market. Subsequently, although buyers took action, prices rose twice, but the Hong Kong market remained stable throughout, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten further. Sellers were happy to supply at high prices, leading to significant price declines. It was predicted that Indian silver "Xiao Er Anna" would be maintained after falling. As a result, the situation was fluctuating and unpredictable, lacking any special changes. Swap rates were quoted at 3 yuan higher by long positions.</p>
<p>Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 903.8 yuan, 0.6 yuan lower than the previous close.

<p>Foreign Exchange Spot and Forward Markets Remain Tight</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Remains Quiet with Mostly Sideways Trading in the First Half of the Day</p>
<p>According to foreign news agencies, London's broadsheets for both spot and forward trading were flat. New York's silver market was unchanged. Montevideo's forward silver prices remained unchanged, or shrank by less than 1%. London's spot gold rose half a penny. The British pound depreciated against the US dollar by 0.125, and the US dollar forward against the British pound was flat. The British pound depreciated against the French franc by 6 points, and the US dollar appreciated against the French franc by 0.01125. Economic expert Xu Peikun's assertion that an inflationary policy was unlikely caused some market fatigue, but Shen Shi News Agency's report of the National Goods Alliance's request to the authorities to reform the currency system caused a segment of the market to not react negatively. The foreign exchange market opened flat, with recent selling prices at 1 shilling and 6 pence for British pound and 37.1875 yuan for US dollars, showing no change compared to the previous close. After the Central Bank's official announcement, with the British pound contracting by 0.25 and the US dollar by 0.5 yuan, and customs gold units rising by 2.5 fen, market sentiment was stimulated again and became tight. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell. HSBC's official announcement showed the British pound contracting by 0.25 and the US dollar contracting by 0.5625, with much struggle remaining. After entering the market, banks took advantage of lower prices to buy, and upon seeing slightly higher prices sold again. Adding to the fact that the Hong Kong market was constantly stabilizing, the process was mediocre, lacking specific changes, however, the potential remained illusory, fluctuating and unstable. Ultimately, expectations for Indian silver remained at 0.02 anna, and banks sold at high prices. Chinese merchants still maintained their position, and the trend was still tight. By the afternoon closing, recent selling prices were 1 shilling 5 pence 8125 for the British pound and 36.8125 yuan for the US dollar, with the British pound tighter by 0.1875 and the US dollar tighter by 0.375, compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants' appetites varied, buying and selling at different times, so the squeeze did not appear to have a large impact. Here is a record of the transactions made in the first half of the day.</p>
<p>British Pound Recent selling price upon morning opening was 1 shilling 6 pence. Mitsubishi sold to You Li August 5 pence 8125. An Da bought August 75. Mitsui bought October 3125.

<h3 id="e167">Overnight Interest Rates and Markups Show No Difference <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Coinage Fluctuated Slightly</p>
<p>The recent financial market has been very stable. Yesterday was also a Saturday, which made the situation even more stagnant. The interbank overnight interest rate in the market was the same in the morning and afternoon, at 0.2 yuan. Markups were also uniformly "white markups" without any added interest, and there have been no changes for many days. Trading in overnight notes seems to have gradually become active. It is estimated that in the morning market, over 3.2 million was transferred, and there were over 600,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, there were over 200,000 in transactions.

As for bank collections, because it was Saturday, some businesses closed in the afternoon, making the situation relatively less active. It is estimated that foreign banks collected over 2.1 million in bills and notes, over 2.7 million in various goods pledges and miscellaneous collections, over 500,000 in special remittances, over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 was for goods coming into the warehouse. Chinese banks collected over 2.7 million in grain tax bills, over 2.8 million in various goods pledges and miscellaneous collections, over 700,000 in special remittances, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 500,000 was for food coming into the warehouse. Japanese banks collected over 2.4 million in bills and notes, over 3.1 million in various goods pledges and miscellaneous collections, over 800,000 in special remittances, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 was for goods leaving the warehouse.

<h3 id="e168">Securities: Major Public Debt Holders Are Again Pushing Up Prices <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the market gradually trending towards stability and firmness. The slightly higher prices listed the previous day were fully compensated yesterday. The later listings had already risen considerably, but yesterday's rise was also slight. Highs and lows offset each other, resulting in a flat market. There are rumors of a certain major player organizing a bullish company, boasting considerable strength, and still observing for opportunities to act. If the environment remains unchanged, the trend should be upward. Although trading in No. 48 bonds is scarce, there are absolutely no sellers, so there will be no immediate risk of a price drop. No. 96 bonds have recovered after weakening, indicating a large number of short positions. Yesterday, the opening saw a sharp rise of 70 cents for forward contracts, while other contracts rose by 10 to 50 cents. In the secondary market, early listings were softer, but later ones rebounded strongly. Bond No. 6 rose sharply by half a dollar. Nos. 35, 48, 56, and 73, as well as traders from the north, were all buying. No. 96 also continued to improve by 10 to 20 cents. The situation clearly shows major players pushing up prices, and it is not yet time to short. The final market prices showed a uniform increase, ranging from 20 to 65 cents. The total transaction volume was 10,066,500 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Shows Mixed Performance</p>
<p>A report from the New China Trading Company states that yesterday (2nd) the New York stock market showed mixed performance. Utility stocks became increasingly dim due to unfavorable legislative prospects, and prices rose slightly. The rest of the market fell across the board as many floating positions took profits. Senator Thomas predicted that the price of silver would rise to one dollar per ounce to attract silver holdings from various locations, so silver prices remained firm. The bond market eased. Small exchange stocks showed mixed fluctuations. The total daily trading volume was 1,510,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Ningbo Traders Aggressively Cutting Losses, Causing Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Yarn</p>
<p>The market is extremely weak, and the trend of falling prices is intensifying. Reports indicate that inflation is not happening at all, and the Ningbo financial turmoil is becoming more severe. At the same time, sales of spot yarn are very sluggish, causing weak sentiment. However, margin calls have soared, reaching a new peak of 917 yuan. Certain long positions remain unmoved. Due to the settlement of competition among floating traders, the market price plummeted by 1.70 to 1.77 yuan.</p>
<p>Far-Month Yarn Contracts Plunge 2.67 Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning session for spot yarn contracts, the current month still rose by 40 cents, but far-month contracts showed softening, falling by one yuan. The trading floor was slack, but the gold market soared, failing to excite sentiment because spot yarn transactions have been too slow recently. Although the long side tried hard to buy, the market price ultimately failed to rise. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.2, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still good, but as trading progressed to the second and third rounds, it gradually weakened, and the situation was exceptionally soft. The closing saw the trend of falling prices intensify. According to some, new yarn may be shipped in this month, and the issue of inflation may be difficult to realize. Many scattered long positions were closed, but margin calls closed at a high. It was found that no major players emerged in the trading hall, but Renfeng Company sold a total of 2,250 bales in the morning and afternoon sessions. As a result, prices for all months fell again by 0.5, 0.7, and 1.1, 1.2, and 0.4 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales volume were as follows: Yida 600 bales, Yukang 650 bales, Hexing 400 bales, Taixing 800 bales, Renfeng 2,250 bales, Taichang 700 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Runkang 550 bales, Shengyuan 1,050 bales, Xinhua 700 bales, and Changyu 400 bales. Purchases were as follows: Tongji 1,100 bales, Jinchang 1,850 bales, Zhenda 550 bales, Changji 650 bales, Hengde 450 bales, Yuanyi 650 bales, Xincheng 2,200 bales, Gengfeng 750 bales, and Taixing 500 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Inventory Balance</p>
<p>Sales of Spot Yarn Are Increasingly Deteriorating</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are quite slow. It was found that various traders bought a total of 252 bales throughout the day. The market is flat and weak. The purchase volume of various traders is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 95; Fellow Traders: 45; Jiangxi: 20;</p>
<p>Guangdong: 10; Wuhu: 17; Xu Mansion: 15;</p>
<p>Nanjing: 50</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The market suddenly declined, with a strong downward trend, because foreign cotton was flat and weak. Many Ningbo money shops closed down, and traders from the region slightly liquidated their large long positions, resulting in a slack trading floor. However, foreign exchange contracted sharply, and margin calls reached a new peak of 918 yuan. Yet the cotton market showed weakness again, falling 0.55 to 0.70 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Falls 67 Cents</p>
<p>In the morning session for standard cotton contracts, margin call prices have already broken through the 910 yuan level. At the opening, prices for all months fell across the board, and the market sentiment was relatively soft. Due to the constraints of the Ningbo trader financial turmoil, there were rumors that they would spit out long positions. As a result, the trading floor was slack and disorganized. Although there were buyers, it was still difficult to reverse the downward trend. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still good, but as trading progressed to the second and third rounds, the market showed no signs of improvement. The declining yarn market led to a decline in sentiment, but foreign exchange was quite weak and the estimated price of foreign cotton remained high. The market sentiment was still flat. As a result, prices for all months fell again by 0.25 to 0.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales volume were as follows: Hengchang 1,100 dan, Chuanda 1,200 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Jifeng 1,000 dan, Daji 7,700 dan, Hexing 3,800 dan, Junchang 2,300 dan, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Tongxing 1,400 dan, Runkang 4,300 dan, Xinhua 2,800 dan, Yikang 2,000 dan, Yifeng 1,700 dan, and Xinheng 2,400 dan. Purchases were as follows: Gengfeng 1,500 dan, Tongfu 1,100 dan, Yukang 1,300 dan, Dafeng 3,400 dan, Jinchang 2,300 dan, Shenji 2,300 dan, Yuanyi 2,400 dan, Yichang 1,800 dan, Changfeng 4,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, and Changhe 6,400 dan.

<p>Very Narrow Price Difference Between American and British Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of US cotton saw all months rise by 1 to 5 points due to purchases by foreign merchants. Subsequently, as the difference between the US and the UK was very narrow, Liverpool traders sold off far-month contracts and closed long positions, causing the market price to soften. On the industry side, with no development in Washington, there was still no way to start. Later, with the closing of long positions and sales from the West, the market price continued to weaken. Hays &amp; Co. estimated that factory usage for the week was 51,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 178,000 bales. The closing trend was relatively stable. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 3 to 11 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 9 to 12 points. Indian cotton weakened due to the closing of long positions and selling by speculators. Pingguoer fell by 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 to 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd telegram):</p>

<p>Grains</p>
<p>Long Positions Are Happy, Futures Flour Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially was flat but then strengthened. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago continued to fall by about 68 cents, and Canadian wheat fell by 20 cents. Therefore, at the initial opening, the market sentiment was quite stable. Then, as gold prices rose step by step, reaching over 910 yuan, a portion of the market sentiment shifted, expecting a reduction in foreign exchange. From then on, there was less hope for foreign wheat orders, so outside buyers were quite active. However, major long positions still sold off, so the increase was minimal. Fuxin spot prices opened at 43 cents at the end of the month, and 40 cents the previous day, inevitably becoming slack. Future ups and downs are greatly related to foreign exchange, because current asking prices for spot foreign wheat are already 45 cents higher than last month, and there will be little activity without foreign exchange coming close. As a result, this month was better by 7.5 cents, September-October were each better by 1 cent, November was better by half a cent, and December was better by 2.5 cents, while January was better by 1 cent.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Rise Along with Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after the morning opening, was generally stable. Although foreign wheat was still quoted down by 20 to 68 cents, the soaring gold prices naturally affected foreign wheat orders, so the market sentiment instead became stable. Opening prices were 34 cents higher than the previous day. Afterwards, transactions became slow and the market tended to fluctuate. Domestic wheat prices are still difficult to reconcile, so there are no special circumstances, and it is not expected to be too low. As a result, this month rose by 3 cents, September rose by 3 cents, October rose by 4 cents, November and December rose by 3 cents. The spot wheat market remains stable. The highest opening price in the north was 62 cents, and the highest opening price in the south was 65 cents. Hefei Mingguang wheat opened at 3.60 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 3.42 yuan, Baoying wheat at 3.56 yuan, Danyang wheat at 3.51 yuan, Luhe wheat at 3.55 yuan, Gaozi wheat at 3.54 yuan, Linhuai Pass wheat at 3.60 yuan, and Zhangbaling wheat at 3.61 yuan. 6,000 bales were taken by Fufeng, 4,000 bales by Fuxin Factory, and 1,000 bales by Xinda.</p>
<p>Local Rice Prices Have Generally Fallen</p>
<p>Local</p>
<p>Rice (Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various traders were more abundant than before, with a total of more than 30 arrivals (nearly 6,000 piculs in total). Sentiment was discouraged, and the sales floor was dull. Only about 200 bales were sold. As a result, the market price of Sutong japonica and Nangang early rice fell by 34 cents. Various thin rice varieties fell by over 23 cents. Dongxin stabilized due to cloudy weather, and Luzhjian was also slightly lower. Yinyuan had no market, and Bianyuan showed weakness. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, 223 sources arrived from downriver, and various goods on the market were taken. White japonica was normal, and the price showed a weakness of about 10 cents. More than 1,000 piculs of Dongxin japonica arrived, with lively retail sales, and the price trend stabilized. Thin rice retail sales were flat and slightly soft, while Baiyuan and other goods had little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Imported</p>
<p>Rice Market Conditions, with rising gold prices, production prices are rising, merchants' thoughts are still firm, intending to hold on and not sell, but local customers are also sluggish, and overall transaction is very slow. Speculators inevitably feel empty and want to sell, and with the listing of new rice in various places approaching, a portion of thoughts are also looking small, just as the reduction in sales leads to an immediate drop in the market. The day opened with more than 3,000 bales of Saigon No. 3 and broken rice, and 2,000 bales of Xiaojiao Su japonica Di Gao Gong Siam rice. Market prices are similar to the previous market, but in reality, it has secretly shrunk by 23 cents.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>The Sugar Market is Active and Rising Across the Board</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with customs gold rising to 1.830 and the issue of Chao sugar control, sentiment was very active and trending upwards. The association divided 24 coarse sand white, with a spot price of 16.90 yuan, and hundreds of bales were traded. Later, it reached 95 cents, up 30 cents. Our warehouse goods are 17 yuan, transit goods are called 5 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B mark is called 18 yuan, all of which have not been traded. There are continuation openings for Chao brand plates, Chao Qing thousands of bales, Huanggang Qing is 9.80 yuan to 60 cents, Bannanquan Qing is 9.35 yuan, and Zheng Hao Mianchi is more than 500 bales, high-quality goods are 12 yuan to 11.56 yuan, ordinary goods are 11.30 yuan to 11 yuan, and the second is slightly reduced, which is up 23 cents. Hainan Chi continued to open more than 500 bales, with a total of 9.80 yuan for white bags and 9.50 yuan for oil bags. The raft market will not be exchanged without 10 yuan. Dongbai J mark is 17 yuan, N mark is 16.90 yuan, Dongchi high-quality goods are called 12.90 yuan, and ordinary goods are 80 cents.</p>

<p>Foreign Firms Must Still Raise Prices If They Want to Trade</p>
<p>After the price of white tung oil in Hankou foreign firms rose to 47 yuan per dan, it became very tight. The previous day, a telegram was sent again, raising it to 48 yuan, and then adding it to 48.60 yuan, reaching the peak, and the situation was very popular. If foreign firms do not stop purchasing, prices will inevitably rise again. To sum up the reasons, the accumulation of producing areas has been thin, and foreign firms have searched everywhere, so that the producing areas are empty, and the demand everywhere exceeds the flood. Fortunately, the interest of various foreign firms in Hankou to purchase goods has slowed down slightly in the past two days, and the market has been slightly shortened, so there was news of 47.60 yuan last night. Although foreign firms have a large number of transactions, they still want to rise. But if there is a slight ups and downs, the increase may also be slightly slowed down. Otherwise, it will go straight to the sky, where will it end?</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was still smooth. Foreign firms from England and France are still very interested in Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi and Yuanyuan, and Pingshui Pearl tea. However, because the supply of incoming goods is less than the demand, the sales of Zhenmei green tea from local traders are also active. Yesterday, Tianyu, Tongfu, Xiehe and other firms all made large amounts of purchases, and the selling price was 44 yuan to 60 yuan, which was slightly firmer than before. The American sales of Yuanyuan Dabang green tea are also active, but they are all retail sales, and the asking price has not been seen to be good.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Occasional Thoughts on the Opening of Children's Year <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>On the eve of the long-publicized Children's Year, just before the grand opening ceremony was held across the country, newspapers reported that a Xu surname elementary school teacher in Ji County, suffering from lung disease, bought a child from a poor family and cooked him alive. This seems to deliberately unveil Children's Year, telling how desolate and cruel it is behind this colorful and brilliant curtain! It is already common for innocent children to be abandoned, sold, or killed along with their poor parents. As long as we are not forgetful, we can still recall the tragic events not long ago when parents took their children and "jumped from high buildings" and "swallowed raw opium" to commit suicide. Therefore, when implementing Children's Year, instead of designing more for wealthy children, it is better to pay more attention to the poor children who are displaced or struggling on the hunger line. The widespread establishment of labor nurseries, infant care centers, and educational institutions are all urgent matters. This will not only benefit the majority of future masters of the country, but also reduce a burden for women struggling on the death line, opening a line of life.</p>

<p>— Shun</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have reported a piece of news that has attracted our attention, that is, the escape of Tang Yulin's wife from her family. This matter is very common, but it happened in a powerful and influential family, so it gives the general public a particularly deep impression.</p>
<p>Regarding Tang Yulin's wife's appeal, it seems that it has not yet aroused public opinion. Such a shameless thing has happened in a powerful family, and the impact will be unimaginable. Standing in the position of women, we should have the right to comment. From the perspective of correcting social customs, it is also necessary to evaluate right and wrong to warn future generations.</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post on July 25, Tang Yulin's first wife, Tang Liu, left home and went to Tianjin due to Tang's abuse, and entrusted lawyer Bao Yang to negotiate with Tang. According to the statement, the reasons for her leaving home are: "Mr. Tang specializes in favoritism and is naturally rude and violent. It has long been taken for granted that he whips and abuses within the boudoir. Under this violence, she only knows how to be submissive and strive for perfection. She originally wanted to grow old together, but the concubines surrounded her and spent their days fighting. Mr. Tang, bewitched by them, treated her cruelly (I don't want to list the facts, and I can't bear to list the facts). He is truly inhumane. Twenty years of cohabitation, if it were not for the weeping pleas of my daughter, my life would almost not have been saved. Thinking of this, my flesh trembles and my heart is terrified. Recently, he has become more and more abusive to my mother and daughter, like a nail in his eye, he must remove it. The malicious abandonment has been very obvious. In such a bad environment where I am not safe from morning to evening, it is really difficult to live together again. Therefore, I took my daughter and escaped empty-handed to Tianjin. For the sake of my life safety, there is no reason to return and re-enter the snare."</p>
<p>In this statement, we can see three points that are beneficial to women.</p>
<p>First, Tang Yulin relied on his power to widely acquire concubines and treat women as playthings.</p>
<p>Second, Tang Yulin relied on his power to "whip and abuse" and "cruelly" treat his first wife, with whom he had lived for twenty years. He is truly inhumane.</p>
<p>Third, Tang Yulin was the former chairman of Rehe Province. As the dignity of a provincial governor, he actually lived a polygamous life and whipped his first wife. If this trend continues, the upper ranks will emulate the lower ranks, and women across the country will share the same fate as Tang Liu.</p>
<p>People say that the army is always brave in internal wars and timid against foreign enemies. This is indeed true. Tang was originally a warlord. When he invaded Rehe, Tang claimed that the righteous army did not listen to orders and abandoned their armor and fled. This is his attitude towards foreign enemies. Now he is accused of abusing his first wife. The internal affairs of the family are exposed. This is Tang who can neither defend against foreign enemies nor appease his family. Thus, the original form of the warlord is completely exposed!</p>
<p>In short, Tang Yulin, who is in the position of the head of a province, owns a group of concubines and abuses his first wife, which is a heinous crime, but for the sake of the future of women, we must carry out severe criticism and merciless attacks!</p>

<h3 id="e175">Section Six: Illegitimate Children and Their Mothers <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>In capitalist society, lifelong monogamy is the ideal of law and morality, while promiscuous polygamy is the common reality and practice. It is quite open and common for a man to have concubines, maids, mistresses, and even prostitutes, indulging in licentiousness. Neither the laws of the country nor the moral opinions of society blame him, and he himself does not feel that this is immoral behavior. However, if a woman has a secret affair with another man besides her legal husband, it is a heinous crime. The law will immediately arrest her, and social opinion will condemn her as an unchaste and promiscuous woman, determining her lifelong fate. This is the "sacred" monogamy of capitalist society, both inside and out.</p>
<p>However, this unreasonable system inevitably produces unreasonable results. This result is the illegitimate child, considered the "crystallization of sin" by civil society. The laws of capitalist countries regard all life born outside the bounds of monogamy as the fruit of sin, branding it with the stigma of illegitimacy, depriving it of its civil rights, and abandoning it outside the protection of the law. But it is not only the illegitimate child who is sacrificed here, but also the illegitimate child's mother, who is seen as a "demon of sin." She is despised by people and her life's happiness is ended. On the other hand, the man's legal wife is also a victim of love. This point must be noted.</p>
<p>The mothers of illegitimate children are mostly underage, poor women and fallen, bankrupt middle-class women. To survive in a social relationship where gold is in the hands of men, they often fall into the trap of love through male seduction, deception, and coercion, which is no different from entering the eighteenth level of hell, with no hope of return. Their children and themselves have to live in darkness, unseen by the light of day. When they think of this, they resolutely resort to desperate acts—suicide, infanticide, abortion, etc., but what public opinion gives them is still the name of sin. Yet they are unwilling to find the root of her sin in this social system!</p>
<p>In order to strictly maintain the glory of monogamy, the civil class subjects hundreds of thousands of illegitimate children to the "sin of being born," depriving them of their civil rights. The Napoleonic Code of France prohibits illegitimate children from recognizing their fathers. Article 1589 of the German Civil Code "does not recognize the kinship between illegitimate children and their fathers." In particular, the law of Argentina stipulates: "Children born of incest or adultery shall not have fathers or mothers, and it is forbidden to recognize their fathers and mothers. Neither father nor mother may even recognize them as children."</p>
<p>Until the World War, the above principles became immovable truths in the family laws of various countries. However, the French law of November 16, 1912, made an exceptional amendment, that is, "Except in cases of rape and seduction, in cases of enticement, de facto cohabitation, and when the father recognizes his children, the father-child relationship is recognized."</p>
<p>Then, why do capitalist countries want to deprive illegitimate children of their "right to life"? The court scholar Meisel most frankly stated this reason, saying:</p>
<p>"It is not in the interest of the state to give children born of licentiousness the same fate as children born legitimately. Why? Because if this were the case, the motive for formal marriage would be eliminated... Also, it is not in the interest of the state to give the same happiness to those without married life as to those with married life. Why? Because the state of family is more beneficial to the country and more helpful to the country than the state of free single people."</p>
<p>This is the entire philosophy of civil society on this issue, and the main reason why the state abandons countless innocent lives of illegitimate children.</p>
<p>As a result of society depriving illegitimate children of their right to life, their mortality rate is twice that of legitimate children. According to a German survey in 1920, the mortality rate per hundred births was 11.9 for legitimate children and 23.0 for illegitimate children. According to Schulte's survey, one in seven legitimate infants died, while one in four illegitimate infants died. According to the same survey, most of the mothers of illegitimate children belong to the working class. For example, among the 94,777 illegitimate children born in Prussia in 1906, 42% were domestic servants, 10% were agricultural laborers, and 22% were industrial laborers.</p>
<p>Many biologists collect evidence of various biological, moral, and intellectual defects in illegitimate children to prove the fact that illegitimate children lack human value. But some scholars among them with a scientific conscience also admit the superior talent and value of illegitimate children. Otto Neurath, the greatest educator in modern Germany, argued:</p>
<p>"Among illegitimate children, there are indeed physical and mental degenerates. But this phenomenon is no more common than in legitimate children. Moreover, the vitality of illegitimate children is often superior to that of legitimate children. Why? Because most illegitimate children are born from genuine love relationships, and are born when their parents are as beautiful as flowers."</p>
<p>Although the laws of capitalist countries use various methods to prevent the inevitable process of illegitimate births, the number of those born is increasing day by day. According to Kuczynski's investigation, the number of illegitimate children in Germany has increased by 40% in the past five years, and there are now 2.5 million illegitimate children. This exposes a major hole in the modern monogamous system. Someone said: "In modern society, there is no such thing as marriage." This statement is by no means without reason!</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Marriage Life of the Miao People in Guangxi <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>The Miao and Yao people live in seclusion in the deep mountains of Guangxi. Due to inconvenient transportation, they are still in a stage of "not interacting with each other until death." Therefore, various customs and habits cannot be communicated with each other, and there is a phenomenon of "different customs every five li, different customs every ten li." Marriage customs are certainly no exception. The following introduction is limited to the situation of some Miao people in the Miao Mountains of northern Guangxi. Before explaining the marriage customs, I would like to first describe the social interaction between men and women. Young men and women there are not bound by the "no physical contact between men and women" rule. As long as they know each other, men can chat and sing all night at the women's houses, freely indulging in a sweet love life. This is the "sitting with a girl" that is common among the Miao people.</p>
<p>After a considerable period, when both parties believe they can get engaged, the man proposes to his parents to ask a matchmaker to propose marriage to the woman's family. As long as the woman's parents agree, the engagement is decided on in a verbal contract between the two parties. From then on, during each solar term or busy farming season, the man's family can bring the woman over, and even the woman's sisters often accompany her to help with work, such as carrying firewood, cooking, and other farming or housework. However, the duration of their stay can only be single nights, such as three nights, five nights, etc. This situation continues regularly until the marriage.</p>
<p>After two or three years, the marriage life begins. Their marriage period is mostly around the third or fourth day of the new year. Before the marriage, the man's family must prepare one or two dan or three or four dan of glutinous rice, ducks, fish, firecrackers, and one or two taels (equivalent to one dollar and sixty cents in small foreign currency) of silver as a gift for the wedding party. The woman's dowry is also equally simple, requiring only a set of cotton bedding, two boxes, and a weaving machine and a spinning wheel each. Sometimes, cows are also given as dowry, which probably depends on the economic situation of each family, but the difference is very small. One or two days or three to five days before the wedding, the matchmaker brings the woman to the man's house. When departing, the bride, escorted by three or four female companions, carrying one liter and three handfuls of white rice, quietly leaves her mother's house at midnight and does not enter the husband's house until four or five o'clock in the morning. At this time, the groom must hide outside, and the family members also remain silent. With the help of the matchmaker and female companions, a grand wedding ceremony is held. The wedding ceremony is as follows: next to the stove, sour fish, sour meat, and duck wine are placed. The bride, the matchmaker, and the female companions all sit around the stove and sincerely worship the gods. After this act is completed, the matchmaker takes all the wine and dishes and feeds them to the bride one by one in a solemn manner.</p>
<p>On the big day of the wedding, which is also what the Miao people call the "wedding day," the man's family takes the gifts prepared before the wedding, accompanied by seven or nine men, and sends the bride and groom back to the woman's house. Along the way, the companions sing and play music, laughing to their heart's content. When they arrive near the woman's village, there are one or twenty people who also sing and play music to welcome them. At the same time, there is also a mountain sedan chair prepared for the groom or his companions to sit in. After sitting in the sedan chair, three to five yuan in small coins must be prepared as a thank-you gift. On the way to the woman's house, various sheds made of bamboo sticks or firewood are erected everywhere to express welcome. Once they arrive at the woman's house, the woman's family entertains them well. That night, the man's wedding party and the woman's relatives and elders have a feast together, singing and answering each other, and toasting each other. The sound of joy is deafening. They do not disperse until they know that the east is turning white.</p>
<p>After the marriage, the woman still lives at her mother's house. During her stay, the woman's chastity is not a concern, so she often secretly conceives a child, who is considered her husband's child. She only returns to her husband's house for a few days during the solar terms and busy farming season. It is not until after she has a child that she lives with her husband regularly. Therefore, the woman's dowry is not sent to her husband's house until after she has had a child. The entire marriage process is then concluded.</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>"Lend it to me temporarily, perhaps a letter from their (referring to her sons) father will arrive soon, and I will definitely return it to you by the end of the year."</p>
<p>"I think you'd better borrow from someone else... Aju! Work faster! See, you get lazy when I talk to others."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law turned around helplessly and slowly came to the child's side, sitting down to breastfeed the child.</p>
<p>Madam Wang put on a stern face and muttered to herself in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Coming to borrow rice from me, where do I get so much rice? Really, always coming to me..."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law pricked up her ears to listen, secretly shedding tears.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen stood up, thin as a donkey, as if at a loss for what to do. The sister-in-law looked at her, showing a disgusted expression:</p>
<p>"Sister! Come and take a look at these two little devils for me. Originally, you haven't been home for a few days, and I shouldn't ask you to do anything, but really, your sister-in-law is having a hard time, one person doesn't have enough time to do so many things." She was about to leave this place to go to the great-grandfather at the back of the house, but it happened that the great-grandfather had just strolled over from the back. Although the great-grandfather was old, he was still healthy. Now, he no longer needed to personally handle field work and mountain work, having entrusted them to his three sons, and even more so, a group of hired farmers honestly worked for him all day long. However, he would still do small things, sometimes weaving straw sandals, sometimes binding brooms.</p>
<p>The great-grandfather greeted Madam Wang, as he was here to ask Master Wang to buy southern goods. Master Wang was the manager of a certain southern goods store in Ningbo, and asking him to buy would give him a discount. The great-grandfather was just about to explain his intentions to Madam Wang when the sister-in-law stopped him and said:</p>
<p>"Great-grandfather! I was just about to go to your place, I want to discuss something with you." Her voice lowered again. "Lend me another two jin of rice, their father will probably have a letter soon, and I will definitely pay you back by the end of the year."</p>
<p>"Borrow rice! I'm having difficulties myself, I painstakingly planted a few acres of fields, but they were all scorched to death by the sun. The harvest is bad, but the land tax is still high. Even if I have a few grains of rice, it's not enough for me to eat myself."</p>
<p>"Great-grandfather! Just lend it to me, I will definitely pay you back by the end of the year. We don't have any rice to cook today, and we can't fill our stomachs with just this ice-cold mustard greens." She pointed to a small vegetable garden in front of her.</p>
<p>"You want two sheng of rice?" The great-grandfather looked at the small garden. "You've already borrowed one dou from me before; hmm... I see... I'll give you another two dou of rice..."</p>
<p>"That's great, that's great! Thank you, great-grandfather, you will always be blessed, you are so kind!"</p>
<p>"But... you mortgage this vegetable garden to me."</p>
<p>"Mortgage the vegetable garden to you?" The sister-in-law hesitated, thinking that this vegetable garden was the source of vegetables all year round. With this vegetable garden, she wouldn't have to buy other vegetables, and she could get by just buying some salt and soy sauce. Her mind turned over and over. "Great-grandfather! Lend me two sheng of rice first, let me think about this matter."</p>
<p>"If you don't mortgage it, it's up to you, but don't borrow from me. I said long ago that I don't have much rice. Even if you mortgage it to me, those two dou of rice will have to be ground from the grain. But having a little more rice is worth it, even if it changes hands."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law went to ask a few neighbors, but still couldn't get any rice. Noon had already arrived, and the children were crying for food. The sister-in-law thought that if her husband still had no news, then the problem wasn't just a matter of one or two meals, how would they get through the year? She panicked for a while and decided to mortgage the vegetable garden to the great-grandfather. She ran to the great-grandfather's place:</p>
<p>"Great-grandfather! I think you should give me three dou of rice, that way I can eat until the new year."</p>
<p>"How about I give you two and a half dou?"</p>
<p>"Then! Great-grandfather! Two dou and eight sheng, I won't say any more."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law invited a schoolteacher to write the contract, and the inkstone and brush were already borrowed. When the schoolteacher wrote the date, he asked:</p>
<p>"From what day?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, from today," said the great-grandfather.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law said hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Great-grandfather! From the fifteenth day of the first lunar month next year! Wait until the mustard greens grow."</p>
<p>"You said from the fifteenth day of the first lunar month next year? Then that's fine!"</p>
<p>The sister-in-law happily repeated to the schoolteacher:</p>
<p>"Sir! Write it like this, from the fifteenth day of the first lunar month next year."</p>
<p>The great-grandfather also leaned over and said to the schoolteacher:</p>
<p>"Sir: write it clearly like this, take two sheng of rice today, and take the rest on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month next year."</p>
<p>"Oh! Like this. This... then what am I mortgaging to you for, great-grandfather! You really are..."</p>
<p>"I haven't done anything wrong. There's an old saying: 'One hand pays the money, the other hand delivers the goods.' And I'm not giving you two sheng of rice first. I'm not asking you for the one dou I lent you before."</p>
<p>The schoolteacher put down his glasses and wiped the snot on his mustache, looking a little embarrassed:</p>
<p>"How should I write it then?"</p>
<p>"Sir! Don't write it, I won't mortgage it to him like this." The sister-in-law turned pale, picked up Xiu Zhen who was comforting the crying child, put the nipple into the child's mouth, and squeezed the empty breast desperately with one hand.</p>
<p>The mother had already come out and heard the news, and she did not approve of mortgaging the only ancestral property to others.</p>
<p>"I'll go borrow fourteen copper coins from old lady Zhonggui, and she'll always ask me to chant Buddha's name later, which can be deducted from the chanting wages. If I can borrow it, I'll go weigh a jin of flour." The mother walked away, and the children watched her retreating figure and continued to cry. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Question</p>
<p>After my husband passed away, the property was divided and a division agreement was established. I only have one adopted daughter under my care. If I remarry, to whom will the property of my late husband belong? Before the remarriage, can I freely sell it, or will it be exclusively enjoyed by my adopted daughter? If the property can be exclusively enjoyed by my adopted daughter, what procedures should I follow to determine her property rights? If the above two methods cannot be achieved, I am willing to donate all the property and deeds to a charity for good deeds. I wonder if anyone will object? Shou Yuan asks.</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>When you remarry, the property inherited from your late husband still belongs to you and you can dispose of it freely. You can either keep it for yourself, give it to your adopted daughter, or donate it to a charitable organization, all of which are permissible.

<h3 id="e179">"Re-Discussion" of the Issue of Coeducation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhe Yong</p>
<p>Mayor Yuan of Beiping, based on his personal views, stood out amidst the national craze for reading classics and honoring Confucius by banning middle schools in Beiping. It is truly astonishing that an administrative head of a city could change the educational system with his own determination. Subsequently, several reports in the newspapers indicated that the Ministry of Education had issued instructions regarding the separation of schools for boys and girls in Beiping, but we still do not know what these instructions are. Therefore, we dare not speculate on what attitude the highest educational administrative agency in the country takes on the issue of coeducation.</p>
<p>However, I feel that the issue of coeducation still has value that is worth re-discussing. We examine it from a historical perspective: In feudal society, women were only in a subordinate position to men. People generally believed that women's intelligence was lower than that of men, so they were judged to be men's playthings or should be men's slaves. The empresses and concubines of emperors and princes belonged to the former, while the wives and concubines of commoners belonged to the latter. After the era entered the capitalist system, women, awakened by the times, were no longer willing to be men's playthings or slaves. As a result, countless small birds of Holm flew out of the puppet family's prison, demanding the equality endowed by nature, demanding economic equality in occupations. This era was our May Fourth era, so schools opened their doors to women, and women participated in all sectors of industry and commerce, and female officials were also active in politics. When this era broke out of the feudal atmosphere, although it encountered great resistance, this resistance ultimately could not resist the great power of that era!</p>
<p>The struggle for coeducation seemed to have ended in the May Fourth era, and it did indeed make people generally understand that male and female education should be equal. But today, twenty years later, to have us drag that dead issue out of the grave for discussion again, I think it would not be a bad thing if it could re-evaluate its value.</p>
<p>Clearly, the reason why the gentlemen who advocate separate schools for boys and girls do not approve of coeducation is that they believe that coeducation is related to social morality, not to make further changes to the educational curriculum based on gender.</p>
<p>Men and women who had just shed the cloak of feudal thought, like girls who had just unbound their feet, often felt awkward and uneasy when walking. Similarly, because the initial concept of the opposite sex among coeducational students was nurtured from the mysterious phenomenon of gender separation in feudalism, there were inevitably more disputes among men and women after liberation. However, this was still because the feudal era made the knowledge of sexuality between men and women too mysterious. We dare to believe that if we give it time and break down all the mystery between men and women, wouldn't men and women still be the same and not that strange? There is evidence that Bebel, in his book "Woman and Socialism," mentioned that the men and women of Sparta had played together naked from childhood, and did not have any mysterious ideas about sexual physiology, but it was not seen that they often caused sexual impulses as a result. Therefore, Bebel also said in the chapter "Woman and Intelligence" that coeducation will never cause male students to abandon their studies due to the temptation of women. On the contrary, precisely because of mutual competition, they strive for honor in front of the opposite sex and work harder and more diligently. May I ask, what relationship does coeducation have with social morality? If it is said that studying in the same room will cause sexual impulses, is that not a joke? If it is said that more opportunities to contact the opposite sex will easily cause social morality problems, then students may have more opportunities to contact the opposite sex outside of school classrooms. In this way, the problem of social morality will be impossible to prevent. Therefore, instead of fundamentally guiding men and women to recognize</p>
<p>proper sexual knowledge, but mystifying it and sealing it off, this is a method of abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, and the result must be a return to the era of feudal thought!</p>
<p>The opportunity for male and female education should be equal, I think no one will object to this premise, but separate schools for boys and girls is tantamount to adding another chain of iron to prevent equality in the case where the opportunity for male and female education is not yet equal. Try to investigate the ratio of male to female students in any school, and it has never reached an equal ratio. Even female students are just a decoration in the school, and it is still far from matching the number of male students. It can be seen that the actual equality of opportunity for male and female education has still not been achieved. In this transitional era, the only right way is to advocate increasing the enrollment of female students. But before the equality in form has been achieved, the order for separate schools has been issued. Only a few girls' schools are set up in the city, and the number is very different compared to the number of boys' schools. This is actually no different from judging the reduction of women's educational opportunities.</p>
<p>I say that the issue of coeducation is worth re-discussing, but what is worth re-discussing is: Should male and female education be consistent? Should there be a part of the difference in the courses received by men and women? But it is not the issue of separate schools for boys and girls. It is a research problem for educators and psychologists, but not a social morality problem worried about by administrative officials.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Body and Soul <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yaqing</p>
<p>The question of the relationship between body and soul, spirit and matter, has been discussed since the dawn of human society. Primitive humans, lacking any scientific knowledge, not only did not understand general natural phenomena, but were also baffled by many phenomena of human physiology and life itself. First and foremost, death puzzled them. In their eyes, when a living person died, their body remained, and the position of their five senses and limbs did not change in the slightest, but their breathing ceased, which was fundamentally different from when they were alive: This was simply a strange thing! From this, they developed a hypothesis: when a person is alive, there must be something that governs their body, and when they die, that thing that governs their body leaves them and goes elsewhere; this thing they called the soul. They believed that the human body was merely a shell, controlled by the soul, and once the soul departed, the person immediately died, and therefore their body had no function; it was the soul that determined the existence of the body, not the body that determined the existence of the soul. Thus, primitive humans formed the belief in the immortality of the soul. This belief was not only supported by the fact that the body did not change when a person died, but also by the more ample evidence of their often seeing dead people in their dreams. They thought, a person has already died, their body has already decayed, why can living people still meet them in their dreams? Isn't this ironclad proof of the immortality of the soul?</p>
<p>Primitive humans also held the same unscientific understanding of sleep. Because people often replay their daytime life in dreams during sleep, such as primitive savages hunting during the day, chasing bison, or fighting with other groups, these things would inevitably be fragmentarily replayed in dreams. Primitive humans believed this to be the action of the soul leaving the body, so they were convinced that the soul could act independently of the body; if it were not so, then how could the body be sleeping here without any movement, while oneself was chasing bison or fighting with others in the wild?</p>
<p>The soul can exist independently of the body and is perpetually immortal: this is the understanding of primitive humans regarding the question of the relationship between body and soul. Due to this understanding, many superstitious beliefs and behaviors of mankind have been formed. According to Lafargue's research, many savages even believe that their body's shadow is their soul, and therefore attach great importance to their shadow. In his famous "The Evolution of the Idea of Justice," he said: "The savages of Epuateu, at noon, because their body has no shadow, do not leave their huts, fearing to lose their soul, even to the point of death. The Greeks also had a similar idea. They believed that those who passed through the temple of Lykaion would lose their shadow and return to death. The image of a person reflected in clear water or on a smooth plane is the image of his soul; if you hit it, you will hurt the soul. The ancient anecdote of Narcissus, and the wax figure curses of medieval magic, are probably linked to this belief. If you remove or move a person's portrait, it is like taking away their soul. For this reason, savages refuse to be portrayed." In fact, not only are there such phenomena among savages, but the development of this belief in "immortality of the soul" can also be seen everywhere in our society. Such as chanting scriptures for the dead, holding memorial services for departed souls, such as grand funerals, venerating ancestors, and superstitious phenomena such as believing in ghosts and gods, are they not all developed from the belief in "immortality of the soul"?</p>
<p>However, with the development of society and human knowledge, mankind has increasingly had a more scientific understanding of all natural and life phenomena. Such as the phenomena of the natural world, are merely the physical manifestations of chemical and physical laws, without any God ruling there.</p>

<p>宰; All phenomena in the process of human life, such as diseases and death, such as dreams, etc., can only be found in sociology and physiology for correct explanation, and the "immortality of the soul" is useless here. --These have all been known to mankind since the flourishing of science in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, even in this era when science has been quite developed, in human society, regarding the understanding of the relationship between body and soul, in addition to some people still holding the primitive belief in "immortality of the soul", there are also some people who call themselves scientists and thinkers who hold mechanistic views; Although this view is more advanced than the "immortality of the soul", it is still wrong, so it must be criticized.</p>
<p>According to mechanists, a person is like a machine that can move; besides having a machine-like body, there is nothing else. Therefore, things like soul, energy, spirit, in their view, do not exist at all, and therefore have no effect in the process of human life. It is true that a soul that is independent of the body as understood by savages does not exist, but if we understand "soul" as "energy" or "spirit", then it does exist. It is just that such a soul does not exist in isolation, but is dependent on the body; it is the body that determines the existence of the soul, not the soul that determines the existence of the body.</p>
<p>With the development of society, human energy is also developing day by day. Now, human intelligence and creativity are several times higher than those of primitive people; people must admit that although people in the twentieth century and people in the primitive era are both human, their wisdom, energy, and soul are not the same: the former is much higher than the latter. From this, we cannot deny the existence and function of the "soul" or "spirit", but this existence is attached to the body. Furthermore, taking an individual as an example, a person not only has a body, but also has their spirit and soul; ultimately, this spirit, this soul, is naturally dependent on the body, but an upward or fallen soul also has a certain reaction on a person's life and even on the entire society. In fact, in our society, there are many people who, in order to live in Western-style houses, eat elaborate dishes, and play with women, indulge their bodies in the abyss of extravagance and debauchery, and do not hesitate to specialize in flattering, fabricating rumors and falsehoods, selling themselves and harming others. People like this, their souls are of course fallen, and can even be said to be walking corpses without souls, and their impact on human society will of course be harmful; conversely, there is another kind of people who are always responsible for the truth, "cannot be moved by wealth and status, cannot be subdued by force", never say things that they themselves consider wrong, and never do things that they themselves consider wrong: This kind of person can be called a person with a great soul, and their impact on human society is of course also promoting. I think that under the current circumstances of "the world is getting worse", "morality is declining", and "credit is bankrupt", everyone, especially young people, must pay attention to maintaining their own pure and great souls, and be ashamed to be associated with walking corpses!</p>
<p>However, I am not asking everyone to pay no attention to material life at all, and not to seek the material things necessary for their lives to maintain the existence of their bodies, and to talk emptily about "great souls"; no, that is a mysterious and abstract high-sounding tune, and can even be said to be the development of primitive superstitious ideas, and we do not make such a proposition. We believe that maintaining life and maintaining an individual's great soul do not conflict, as long as you do not have excessive material desires. Naturally, people always want their material life to get better day by day, but people who value their personality and have a clear understanding of objective truth do not only want their individual life to get better day by day, they mainly strive to make the material life of the general society get better day by day; therefore, in times of emergency, they would rather sacrifice their bodies than sell their souls to harm human society: This is the kind of person with a great soul that we praise, and this kind of person is what we should and can do.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Roar, Pengtian River! <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Kuoching</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence</p>
<p>The Pengyin River is about seven miles from Tangluo in the undetermined area between Yunnan and Burma. The source of the river comes from the Kumen Ridge, and the western branch flows into the Mai Likai River. About a mile from the Pengyin River, you can already hear the sound of the surging river, which is truly thrilling, simply roaring like an army of thousands chasing the enemy. If one is a timid person, I believe one would definitely not want to get close to such a terrifying sound.</p>
<p>In winter, the river is completely dry, but after the spring rains, the streams from the four mountains converge into this river, and then the river is full. The river is more than a mile wide, and the banks are full of grotesque rocks. Some look like they are lying down or squatting, some are lined up on the shore like guards, some are pillars in the middle of the river like one man guarding the pass, and some lie across the heart of the river, where the rapid current rushes and makes the sound of the weak resisting. The turquoise river rolls eastward, set against the lush green high mountains and the towering peaks that stand alone and pierce the clouds. Such beautiful scenery can definitely not be appreciated by people elsewhere. We often wandered there, singing the song "Beautiful China" boldly, and would not want to leave until the sun urged us.</p>
<p>I once naively thought about building a thatched hut there, wandering by the river all day long, reading the books of the ancients as much as possible, sadly expressing the songs of the heart, quietly avoiding the troubles of the world, and living a leisurely life, free from strife with the world, working at sunrise and resting at sunset, living the life of primitive people, but this is a dream that can never be realized, this heavy burden will not allow me to be lazy or to shirk responsibility. But then I thought, if ordinary dignitaries were to see such good scenery, perhaps they would have the idea of "I will enter the mountains and travel with Chisongzi," and living beings could suffer less misery.</p>
<p>The Pengyin River has a large iron cable bridge built by the British, which is more than twenty feet long and eight feet wide. The iron cable is twisted together from many fine iron wires, forming an iron rope as thick as a head. There are a total of six iron ropes, two are erected on the top of the bridge, and four are placed at the bottom of the bridge. The two ends of the iron rope are deeply buried in the soil and stone on both banks, and then wooden boards are laid flat on the four iron ropes on the bottom surface one by one, and the upper and lower sides are connected with iron bars as thick as fingers, and the iron bars are nailed to the wooden boards with nails, thus a top iron cable bridge is successfully built. This iron cable bridge is much stronger than a rope bridge and more convenient than a zipline bridge, so many bridges there are built with iron cables.</p>
<p>Not far from crossing the Pengyin River, about five miles away, is a village. All of them are wild people, and they mostly carry weapons such as knives and spears on their shoulders, and carry bamboo baskets on their backs to transport things, wearing short clothes made of printed cloth, with some wearing pants and some wearing a skirt on their lower body. The women also carry bamboo baskets on their backs, wear short clothes and long skirts, and wear amber ear studs or two pairs of shackles on their ears. Men, women, old and young all like to chew raw gambier, and they use lipstick as beauty, so everyone has a blood basin-like mouth. Once, when we approached them, they and they all looked at us with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah! Where did these people come from?" they mumbled in their local language. I just stared at them blankly. One of our companions who understood their language replied to them: "We are here to play, and we also plan to give you some things as a greeting gift." As he spoke, he took out the needles, brocade, local cloth, old cloth, tobacco, etc. that we had specially prepared, and gave each of them a copy.</p>
<p>As they were talking, the sun was only a glimmer of light, so I opened the mirror and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to take a photo, but they suddenly ran away, and the panicked state was really like they had discovered the enemy or encountered a man-eating tiger or leopard.</p>
<p>"This is something that captures people's souls, you are all high officials of the Celestial Dynasty, how can you do such illegal things?" They negotiated with one of our companions in their local language.</p>
<p>"No, we are not high officials, this is taking a photo. If you take a photo, there will be a piece of paper inside that will show your shape on that paper." My companion said.</p>
<p>No matter how you explained it, they would never allow us to photograph them. Before long, the sun had already hidden in the clouds, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was finally lost in this way.</p>
<p>In this village, there is only one Han Chinese family, and they run a small shop specializing in selling groceries. In such a remote place, among thousands of wild people, to find a few Han Chinese is such a happy thing! They, almost assimilated with the wild people, only because their ancestors passed down the story that they were Han Chinese, so they never admitted that they were natives, but said that they were Han Chinese. They only knew that they moved there during the Ming Dynasty, when there was an emperor, so they also asked us: "What dynasty is it now? Who is sitting on the throne?" We told them in detail, but they just listened like they were listening to a story, and they didn't believe that China had no emperor. Finally, he cried bitterly, saying that they were being invaded because they had lost the protection of their motherland. When they cried bitterly, we were also sighing, grieving for the fate of the motherland.</p>
<p>They don't know spring, summer, autumn, and winter, they only know that when the wild flowers bloom, it is spring, when the sun is like a fiery umbrella, it is summer, when the grain and rice are harvested, it is autumn, and when the white snow is flying in the sky, it is winter, and the first day of the new rice being harvested is considered New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Another time, we went to play at a native's house, and they were brightly lit and celebrating the New Year, with many dishes arranged on the table, including fish, beast meat, etc. When we walked into their house, they welcomed us very much, and they thought it was a very exciting thing to meet a Han Chinese on New Year's Day. After we sat down, we drank their homemade white wine, the taste of which could definitely not be bought anywhere else.</p>
<p>Halfway through the drinking, the host stood up and gave a speech, looking very serious. His sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters all listened quietly. I just stared blankly, not knowing what kind of story he was telling. Later, our companion translated it for us, and we learned that he said this:</p>
<p>"Listen to me! We were all descendants of Meng Huo. That year, Zhuge Wuhou conquered the south, and Meng Huo was defeated and captured. Thanks to Wuhou not killing him, we have today. So we thank Wuhou, and we should thank the Han Chinese even more, because Wuhou is a Han Chinese. We have been receiving Han favors for generations, so from now on we should remember that the Han Dynasty is our benefactor."</p>
<p>They have been passing this down from generation to generation, and every New Year's Day, the head of the family announces it to his children and grandchildren. Therefore, they still remember China firmly, even under the rule of imperialists, they still do not forget China.</p>
<p>According to our companion: "There are all high mountains and steep ridges, so the natives make a living by planting rice fields. Their cultivation method is to let it grow and bear fruit on its own. If they can be taught planting methods, then the harvest will definitely not be just this little bit. Because life can still be lived, this has developed the habit of being lazy. Other products there include animal skins, musk, deer antler, lacquer, medicinal materials, sesame, etc.; tea is also produced there, with a strong flavor, but unfortunately no one cares about it now. What is produced on the ground is so abundant, as for what is underground, it is even more spectacular, and if it is developed, there will definitely be very surprising developments. As for all the customs of the natives, they are almost the same as those of the Han Chinese."</p>

<h3 id="e182">A Humble Opinion on the Problem of Amateur Further Study <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Chen</p>
<p>I think that if one is a progressive professional, no matter what kind of person in the business world, from the factory director and manager to the worker and apprentice, they will all feel the pain of not having enough knowledge. The main reasons are no more than five: 1. In the period of schooling, due to poor family circumstances or sudden changes in economic conditions, they dropped out of school midway and had to embark on a professional path; 2. Because of insufficient effort during the period of schooling, their acquisition of knowledge was not substantial; 3. Because they did not affirm their future path during the period of schooling, they did not use what they learned; 4. Because of the relationship between professional interests and other unavoidable reasons, they changed careers midway, resulting in a very lack of knowledge of the new profession; 5. Because they have been in the industry for a long time, they lack opportunities for further study, or they study further without good guidance, resulting in panic about knowledge.</p>
<p>Professionals are urgently in need of opportunities for further study, the reason being: on the one hand, they can relieve the hunger for the above-mentioned intellectual desire, and on the other hand, they can remedy the defects in their business with the results of the knowledge they have acquired, and further seek to improve their business. However, in fact, can the wishes of these professionals be truly satisfied? Needless to say, this is very pitiful. Of course, the government is worried that it will not be able to sustain the surface relief of the recent decline of industry and commerce, and will definitely not think of the smaller problems considered by politicians, such as the amateur further study of industrialists and businessmen. Educators, for these professionals, that is, the students of previous educators, are like daughters who have been married off and water that has been poured out, and no longer pay attention to or care about them. Thus, after a few years, the common people will often fall behind the later competitors. This is not only a luxury and waste of talent cultivation in a country, but also the biggest obstacle to not being able to compete successfully with other countries.</p>
<p>Some people say that starting a business is difficult, but maintaining it is even more difficult. I also say that it is not easy to cultivate talent, and it is even more difficult to prevent the already cultivated talent from becoming corrupt. Therefore, I dare to loudly call for the opinions and specific measures of "promoting amateur further study" and "broadly seeking opportunities for further study for professionals" before people in society:</p>
<p>1. Build Large-Scale Amateur Libraries</p>
<p>Although further study is not limited to books, we can affirm that books are indeed the results of research or experience accumulated by predecessors. Although learning can be known after practice, knowing before practice, or knowing and practicing at the same time, is not necessarily a more convenient method for our time-saving professionals. However, the economic ability of most professionals themselves is very weak. Not to mention the limited ability to support a family, even the ability to support themselves is unreliable. How can they bear the debt of buying books again? Therefore, we cannot but hand over this responsibility to the public libraries of society. However, the current state of public libraries, except for a few facilities in remote rural areas, even in cities, most of them are abnormally simple, or too specialized (such as focusing on social sciences or literature departments), or too focused on low-level interests (such as displaying picture magazines with various women's photos), and most of them are not suitable for the reading of the vast number of professionals.</p>
<p>I believe that in addition to basic items, a more standard amateur library should list various professional departments, from shallow to deep, in a progressive style, to accommodate different levels of intellectual ability and various aspects of theory or skills.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>This is naturally a more troublesome task, but I dare say that if these points cannot be achieved, this library will still not be able to universally meet the different needs of general professionals.</p>
<p>2. Open University Lectures</p>
<p>Now, whether in China or abroad, university lectures seem to be mostly the monopoly of special classes. In form, it seems like a proud noblewoman, and ordinary people cannot obtain even the desire to have a close look at her beauty. Is there a need to revise this system? I think it is worth discussing. The academic itself is indeed noble, but the application of the academic should be as popular as possible. The academic cannot only be used by a few capitalists, but should tend to the souls of the masses. I heard that Cambridge, England already has this atmosphere, and there are several courses that can be specially selected for amateur listeners. This is a good method that can be imitated. I advocate opening all lectures in various universities to allow professionals who are determined to conduct in-depth research to study freely. I think these free researchers, they do not come for diplomas, they may be more effective than college students who go to university to spend their years as dormitories.</p>
<p>3. Establish Amateur Further Study Guidance Centers</p>
<p>The existing "mailboxes", "consultants", etc., which are similar in nature to guidance, are mostly narrow in scope and confined to the circle of common sense, and are really not enough to meet the desires of professionals who have various different needs. Therefore, I advocate establishing a complete amateur further study guidance center, which not only guides how to study further, but also has the responsibility of explaining difficulties. The guidance personnel should be broadly recruited from domestic academics and entrepreneurs to be responsible for the duties. For the sake of convenience, they can be attached to famous universities or famous amateur libraries.</p>
<p>The above three points are essential plans for the purpose of promoting the further study of general professionals, enriching the knowledge and skills of industrialists and businessmen, and developing their business. However, this matter is of great importance. If it can attract jade by throwing bricks and make society and the government pay attention to this, then the writing of this article may not be in vain!</p>

<h3 id="e183">On Humor <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ze</p>
<p>The two characters for "humor" (滑稽) are not a recent invention; they have existed since ancient times. Figures like Dongfang Shuo and Chunyu Kun were known in ancient texts as "humorous individuals." However, the so-called humor of the past seems to differ from that of the present. Humorous predecessors like Dongfang Shuo and Chunyu Kun primarily used indirect arguments, sophistry, or metaphorical language to remonstrate with rulers and challenge scholars. The modern understanding of humor, however, has a sense of making people feel lighthearted and laugh. According to the current common interpretation of humor, it is the opposite of solemnity and seriousness and does not evoke feelings of tragedy or indignation; the feeling it gives people is relaxed and pleasant. Aristotle, in his "Poetics," said, "Humor is a defect or ugliness that does not involve pain or disaster." Although this is the saying of an ancient Greek philosopher, it also contains the meaning that we recognize today: humor is the opposite of solemnity and seriousness and can make people laugh.</p>
<p>What constitutes various forms of humor is mostly trivial matters of human life. According to general observation, humor can be roughly divided into the following categories: First, humor inherent in excessively abnormal and grotesque figures, such as the small-headed man at the Shanghai City God Temple, the world's largest fat man weighing over seven hundred pounds, and dwarfs less than two feet tall, are humorous things that make people burst into laughter at first sight. Second, humor composed of extremely disharmonious and disproportionate things, such as the disharmonious expression of Granny Liu visiting the Grand View Garden as depicted in "Dream of the Red Chamber," and the exaggeratedly made-up male actors playing female roles in traditional Chinese operas, are examples of this category of humor. Third, the unexpected and unusual things that possess humor: For example, if there were a modern young man walking hand in hand with a completely traditionally dressed, bound-footed woman on Nanjing Road, the scene would probably make even the most composed person laugh until their stomach ached. Also, as everyone knows, Laurel and Hardy, known as "a pair of living treasures," often do all kinds of unexpected and clumsy things on the screen to make the general audience laugh, which is why they have become comedic stars. These two are concrete illustrations of this category of humor.</p>
<p>As for the humor we express in our conversations and writings, it generally contains one of these two meanings: First, it can stimulate people's sexual feelings; second, it has a satirical meaning. Because everyone has a sexual instinct and a desire to satisfy sexual desires, it is easiest to create humorous and funny words and stories in the relationship between men and women. In rural areas and among ordinary laborers, this kind of humorous and interesting story is the most popular. As for humor with a satirical meaning, good examples can be found in the words of general orators and eloquent speakers, and in the works of some literary writers. For example, Gogol's "The Quarrel of the Two Ivans" and "The Government Inspector," Wu Jingzi's "The Scholars," and Li Boyuan's "A Record of Officialdom Exposed," all have a spicy satirical meaning and a humorous and funny tone. Now, let us randomly quote a passage from "The Scholars" for reference!</p>
<p>"...The two (Zhang Jingzhai and Fan Jin) came in. First, Jingzhai paid his respects, and Fan Jin came forward to perform the ritual between teacher and student. Magistrate Tang repeatedly declined and offered them tea. He chatted with Jingzhai about their long separation and praised Fan Jin's articles, asking, "Why didn't you go to the metropolitan examination?" Fan Jin then said, "My late mother passed away, and I am observing mourning according to the regulations." Magistrate Tang was shocked and hurriedly ordered to change into auspicious clothing. He escorted them to the back hall and set out wine... The magistrate sat down, and the tableware used were all inlaid with silver. Fan Jin hesitated to pick up the cup and chopsticks. The magistrate did not understand why. Jingzhai smiled and said, "Mr. Shi is observing mourning according to the regulations and probably won't use these cups and chopsticks." The magistrate hurriedly ordered them to be replaced. He replaced them with a porcelain cup and a pair of ivory chopsticks, but Fan Jin still refused to use them. Jingzhai said, "These chopsticks are also not to be used." He then replaced them with a pair of white bamboo chopsticks, and only then was it over. The magistrate wondered, "He is so respectful in his mourning that perhaps he doesn't use meat or wine, but I didn't prepare any." Later, he saw him pick a large shrimp meatball from the bird's nest bowl and put it in his mouth, and then he felt relieved..."</p>
<p>What is expressed here is not only humorous and funny but also contains a spicy satirical meaning.</p>
<p>Because humor can make people laugh easily, and what is contained in general words often contains a satirical meaning, in our conversations and in our writings, if we are good at using humorous satirical words, and good at expressing humorous things with a satirical flavor, it can have unexpected effects. However, this is a very difficult thing to do well. First of all, we must know the objective meaning of humor. That is to say, whether a sentence or a thing is humorous depends mainly on your audience and readers, and cannot be based entirely on your subjective arbitrariness; it is necessary for what you subjectively consider humorous to coincide with what is objectively considered humorous. More specifically, it is necessary that what you find funny, your audience or readers also find funny, in order to have an effect, otherwise it will cause people to dislike it. In general chatting and bragging, we often see some people who are not lively and do not understand humor, pretending to be lively and humorous, giving long humorous jokes, but as a result, in addition to laughing alone, other people not only do not laugh, but also feel bored and feel that it is a bit of a killjoy. Such inconsistent expressions of subjective humor and objective humor not only fail to produce the effect of humor but also reveal the "humorist's" ineptitude. Furthermore, the expression of humor should also avoid vulgarity and frivolousness, that is to say, humor should have profound social significance and should not be composed of trivial and low-level things. Only such humor can produce a meaningful satirical effect and be beneficial to oneself and human society; otherwise, it will not only make oneself a clown, despised and played with, but also trivialize many serious issues, preventing the truth from being revealed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the expression of humor should also be limited and not humorous at any time and in any place. Because no matter what, even if it is humor with great satire, it is not very serious, and therefore it hinders the formal resolution of the problem. Imagine, if you only satirize and express humor no matter what happens, such as when someone in another family dies, or when the country is in danger, wouldn't that be too unreasonable! I think only those noble ladies who are tired of material life specialize in pursuing humorous interests to kill the long years; only those clowns who specialize in relying on women for food and clothing specialize in talking about humor and studying humor; ordinary people who live seriously, even if they want to say a little humorous word and say a little humorous thing, are limited and have a meaningful meaning.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Tolstoy's Humanitarianism <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>Tolstoy is not only a world-renowned writer but also the most famous humanitarian. Because his humanitarian teachings contain many truths, and because he has great artistic talent, the influence of his humanitarianism and the value of his works are very great.</p>
<p>First of all, what is worth our attention is his famous "On Art." I think the value of this work is above many other books on "Introduction to Art." In this, Tolstoy has put forward many propositions that our "new" literary researchers have not thought of, and has said many things that many "new people" dare not say now. He has opposed various idealistic views of art in strong language, he has boldly pointed out the hypocrisy of the lives and art of the upper classes, and he has striven to praise the lives and art of the general working masses, showing his just and zealous attitude of loving truth. But we should understand that Tolstoy expresses all his opinions from the standpoint of Christianity and from the standpoint of humanitarianism. After refuting idealistic theories and vehemently criticizing the lives and art of the upper classes, he clearly put forward the proposition that religious thought determines the value of art. He said:</p>
<p>"The evaluation of the characteristics of art (that is, the emotion it conveys) is closely related to man's understanding of the meaning of life and the happiness or unhappiness of life as he sees it. The happiness or unhappiness of life is entirely determined by religion."</p>
<p>Under such a religious view of art, he also combined his doctrine of "non-resistance to evil" with art. According to him, only those works that can make the persecuted love their persecutors can be considered the greatest. He said:</p>
<p>"A noble work of art is not a temple of victory, with statues of victors, but a description of the human soul created in love, capable of making the robbed and killed pity and love his oppressor."</p>
<p>In this way, Tolstoy, while expressing great sympathy for the persecuted and being very "humane," ultimately wanted to make "the robbed and killed pity and love their oppressor" in order to preserve the position of the "oppressors."</p>
<p>The second half of the nineteenth century in Russia was precisely the time when the declining landed gentry used various cruel methods to deal with the general Russian people in order to maintain their rule. At this time, Tolstoy put forward the proposition of "non-resistance to evil," his reason being: "Because fire cannot extinguish fire, water cannot dry water, and evil cannot be eradicated by evil." But if this were really the case, then all the evil deeds of the Russian landed gentry at that time would not be resisted, and their position would not be questioned. From this, we can say that Tolstoy's teachings, his view of art, and his humanitarianism are all reflections of the consciousness of a certain section of the landed gentry of Russia at that time.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Tolstoy's many literary works were also written under his view of art and his humanitarianism. Therefore, the central consciousness expressed in his literary works is fundamentally the consciousness of a section of the landed gentry. It is true that Tolstoy, the religious figure and humanitarian, was a great realist writer who, in his many literary creations, used the realist method of depiction to ruthlessly expose the decadent lives and evil deeds of the landlords and aristocrats. For example, in "The Kingdom of God Is Within You," he ruthlessly exposed the cruel oppression of peasants by officials, in "What Then Must We Do?" he truthfully showed the close relationship between the entertainment of the upper classes and the suffering of the people, and in "I Cannot Be Silent" he described the cruelty of those who dealt with peasants with the death penalty... However, he was talking about these things from the moral sins of the landlords and aristocrats</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>to explain these things, and did not actually describe them; he did not advocate that "the robbed and killed" resist their "oppressors," but instead asked them to "pity and love" their "oppressors," hoping that those "oppressors" - the landlords and aristocrats - would reform and do good. His such efforts "are nothing more than the most cunning, and therefore the most detestable, cultivation of clericalism."</p>
<p>Due to the development of capitalism, the Russian countryside at the end of the nineteenth century suffered irreparable destruction. In this destruction, not only the landlords and aristocrats felt uneasy, but also the suffering in the lives of the general peasants was increasingly deepened. Thus, imperceptibly, peasants and a section of landlords stood on the same front in opposing urban capitalism. Thus, the humanitarian Tolstoy also reflected in his works the consciousness of the landlords and peasants, hating the city, opposing capitalism, and praising the simple countryside. - From this point of view, it can also be seen that Tolstoy's worldview and his humanitarianism are aristocratic.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Overseas Chinese Around the World (5) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>Burma</p>
<p>Burma borders Thailand to the east and is located south of the Yunnan-Sichuan border region of our country. There are approximately 300,000 overseas Chinese here, most of whom are skilled workers, merchants, and coolies. Since Britain annexed Burma in 1895, the influence of overseas Chinese in Burma has been greatly hit, but until the outbreak of the European War, the influence of overseas Chinese in Burma was developing day by day. They did business and worked in places like Yangon and could earn some money every year, and many of them had become wealthy. At the same time, in addition to running their own businesses, overseas Chinese in Burma also strived to establish schools and newspapers to develop overseas Chinese education and culture. But since the outbreak of the European War, the situation has become increasingly different from before. First, because Britain incited the Burmese to exclude overseas Chinese, our compatriots in Burma were greatly hit; second, because the power of Indian Chettiars (Indian moneylenders) was increasingly developing in Burma, the lower-level merchants among the overseas Chinese had to rely on them to maintain their livelihoods, and in fact, the inherent position of overseas Chinese in Burma had been replaced by the Chettiars; at the same time, the financial power of European and American countries was also increasingly penetrating Burma. There are now more than a dozen banks from seven countries in Yangon, all with strong capital and well-organized. However, there is only one bank in Yangon that belongs to Chinese nationality, and its capital is not very strong, so it is naturally unable to compete with others in business. In this way, since Burma's finances are in the hands of foreigners, its industry and commerce cannot compete with others, and it is also openly excluded by the Burmese, how can the influence of overseas Chinese in Burma not decline day by day?</p>

<p>Vietnam is located in the south of China and is connected to provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. We usually call it Annam, and foreigners call it French Indochina. As early as the Qin and Han dynasties, Vietnam was once an internal territory of China; the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties also regarded China as the suzerain. It was not until the Sino-French Treaty of 1885 was signed that Vietnam changed from a territory of China to a French colony. There are no exact statistics on how many overseas Chinese there are here: some say 400,000, some say 600,000, and some say more than one million; but no matter what, the number of overseas Chinese in Vietnam is at least 700,000 or 800,000. Most of them are from Guangdong and Fujian. On October 16, 1906, in order to facilitate its rule, the French government divided the overseas Chinese in Cochinchina into five groups based on their differences in origin and language and had them live in five districts. The so-called five groups are Guangzhou, Fujian, Hainan, Chaozhou, and Hakka.</p>
<p>Most of the people from Guangzhou in Vietnam are engaged in industry and commerce. In Saigon and other places, rice shops, timber shops, cloth shops, brick and tile manufacturing, lime manufacturing, fur, animal bones, and other industries are all operated by Cantonese people. In addition, carpenters, stonemasons, tailors, bootmakers, and butchers are also mostly Cantonese. Although the number of people from Fujian in this area is relatively small, their influence in industry and commerce is very great. Factories and rice shops in places like Cholon are mostly opened by them. According to surveys, there are more than 30 rice milling factories in Saigon, of which those operated by overseas Chinese account for as many as 28 or 29, and Fujianese account for the largest number in these 28 or 29. Hakka overseas Chinese are also mostly in Saigon and Cholon, and what they operate is mainly the tea industry; the Vietnamese tea industry is almost exclusively occupied by them. As for the Chaozhou people, most of them work as boatmen and coolies here, and those in the western provinces of Norodom also engage in agriculture.</p>
<p>Before France annexed Vietnam, overseas Chinese in Vietnam were treated quite favorably, and it was extremely convenient for Chinese people to go to Vietnam. Recently, the French have imposed various exorbitant taxes and levies on overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and even coolies and peddlers cannot avoid them. As for Chinese people going to Vietnam, they are made difficult in many ways: when entering the country, not only must they have their bodies checked and fingerprints taken, but they must also pay a certain amount of entry tax and body tax; if they are deemed to be slightly unsuitable, they will not be allowed to land, and even after landing, they are always in danger of being deported. Therefore, the fate of overseas Chinese in Vietnam is the same as that of overseas Chinese in other places: it is declining day by day.</p>
<p>The Philippines</p>
<p>The Philippines is a large island facing the Min and Yue provinces of our country across the sea, with an area of 120,000 square miles and a population of 11 million. As early as the Zhou and Qin dynasties, the Philippines and China already had exchanges. Many Filipinos are of mixed Chinese descent, and their agricultural tools, customs, and even the pronunciation of their names are very similar to those in China: these facts can fully prove the close relationship between China and the Philippines.

<p>They are both children, one runs around in the scorching sun all day because he is poor and his mother is sick. One is able to live a fairy-like life under the electric fan because he is rich and his parents love him. But the one who lives a fairy-like life often shouts that he is hot, while the one who runs around in the scorching sun does not complain or lament. What is the reason for this? Once the two meet, in the interaction, there is a different emotion that stirs everyone's heart.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Ye Ye Society Will Perform "The Merry Widow" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The drama movement in this city can now be said to be very intense. In the past half year, it has almost become a world of drama. One step further, it can be said to be the year of drama. During this period, the Ye Ye Society, which dominated the north, has also announced its establishment on Father Labour Road in this city and has been registered with the Education Bureau. According to the society, it has a history of two years and has performed about twenty times without failure. It was first established in Beiping and then in Jinan. This organization was organized by Tu Qufei, the leader of the society's traveling troupe, together with Li Ruoshui, the director of the Ye Ye Drama Society's Shanghai office. The cast consists of sixteen or seventeen men and women, all of whom are from Beiping. The society is currently preparing very intensively. The first performance is said to be "The Merry Widow." The plot is extremely romantic and luxurious, and the costumes and sets are extremely magnificent, costing a great deal. It is currently in rehearsal and will soon be performed at the Jincheng Grand Theater. It is still a pioneering effort for a northern troupe to perform in Shanghai. At the time of the performance, there will be a different kind of spectacle. Ladies in Shanghai who love drama can enjoy a feast for the eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Zhang Zhiyun Replays "The Peach Blossom Fan" <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Former movie queen Zhang Zhiyun has recently changed her lifestyle, and her beautiful figure is rarely seen in social circles. However, those who visit her private residence see Zhang lightly powdered and dressed in plain clothes, with a naturally pure and elegant demeanor, and her charm is no less than in the past. Xinhua Film Company is producing "The Peach Blossom Fan" as a surprising move. In addition to recruiting dozens of major stars such as Jin Yan, Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, Wang Cilong, Gu Menghu, Dai Yanwan, and Zhang Zhizhi, the company is still lacking a suitable talent to play a certain important female role in the play. They discussed it with Zhang Zhiyun, who has agreed to appear on the screen in "The Peach Blossom Fan" as a guest performer.</p>
