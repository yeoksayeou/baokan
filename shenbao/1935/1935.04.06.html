<h3 id="c24">對於國民經濟建設運動之希望 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>我國自鴉片戰爭以還。門戶洞開。列强相繼以政治經濟之勢力。侵入中原。於是吾舊有之經濟組織遂不足以適應時代環境。以百年爲一世紀。則中國經濟受外力之壓迫與摧殘者。已有一世紀之歷史。時至今日。不獨外患愈烈。且天災人禍。連綿迭起。國民經濟前途。實有足以令人愈益悲觀者。然而成敗利鈍事在人爲。今日之現象雖可悲觀。吾人若能於悲觀之際。出之以大决心。持之以大毅力行之以大計劃。則今日悲觀之現象。焉知非來日樂觀之根基。最近蔣委員長於勦匪工作之餘。遍歷各地。深感復興民族。非徒恃軍事力量所可成功。爰發起國民經濟建設運動。以爲國民自救之根基。故此一運動關繫至重。不問在國家之立塲上言。抑或在民族經濟之立塲上言。吾人均當掬誠以祝其成功也。</p>
<p>然望之深則思之切。吾人竊有不能不貢獻於此運動者數點。請略爲言之。十餘年來。國人之談經濟建設者衆矣。或着眼於工業。或注重於農業。或取法乎外國之設施。或主墨守我國舊習。所言往往偏頗於一方。故其理論未必皆可取爲建設中國經濟之計劃。卽以過去政府所立之各項建設計劃論。亦容或不免有趨重於一端而輕忽於另一端。者故在計劃之當時。皆可以言之有理。持之有故。一旦取以實行。則在理論上所不易見之缺陷。或不免隨而發生。懲前毖後。此種過往之短處。吾人良不能不希望全國上下於今日之經濟建設運動中。注意避免之。也申言之。在今日欲求中國國民經濟能有新的建設。同時欲使其建設爲有效。則其計劃必須全般的而非局部的。且尤必須注意於中國經濟之特質與弱點。然後視其弱點之所在。根據其固有之特。質爲澈底之平均的建設。不使爲畸形之發展。則此種建設。卽可爲復興之基。而收「一勞永逸」之效。</p>
<p>其次·中國今日之經濟建設。吾人希望其不特於計劃上有統盤之籌算。且於計劃之施行上。亦有緩急先後之分。蓋必急其急·緩其緩。先其先·後其後。則其所成者乃大。而一切計劃亦能盡量發揮其效果。人之常情。往往避重就輕。然而一國經濟之建設。切忌蹈此流弊。否則·計劃雖完善。恐亦不易收宏富之成效也。</p>
<p>復次·在國民經濟建設運動之中尚有一重要之問題。卽建設人才之培植。過去我國若干涉及於技術之施政。類皆聘用外人設計或顧問。此種現象。在一國建設之初。誠爲不得已之舉措。然而聘用外人。不特所費甚大。且往往以國情不同。形成許多之隔膜。故「楚材晋用」之政策。可以用之於一時。而究非長久永遠之計。因此吾人於今日之國民經濟建設運動中。更不能不希望政府。對於建設人才之培養。亦加以深切之注意興切實之準備。</p>
<p>總之·在今日中國悲觀重重之現狀下。國民經濟建設之運動實爲當前切要之。舉行之得其。道不僅可以登斯民於水火。亦可從而改善吾國之國際地位願我國。人共起圖之。</p>

<p>中國防癆恊會第二届徵募大會特刊</p>
<h3 id="c196">中國防癆協會徵募大會宣言 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>本會宗旨，以預防及治療癆病為唯一目的。於民國二十二年十月成立。其時，卽揭示其趨向；至活動之方法，在預防方面，須喚起國人皆知癆病侵襲之害，獲得防癆常識，改革不良習慣，互相勗勉，期將癆病减少而底於肅淸；在治療方面，須挽救已病者之恢復健康，亦卽所以防止癆菌之隨處散播；一年以來其巳舉辦之事項：一為發行防癆雜誌，以貫輸防癆之知識，二為舉辦夏令兒童健康營，以增强兒童之身體，養成其防癆習慣；三為設置第一第二癆病診療所，為患者免費診察及治療，唯以癆病患者之普遍，决非前述區區之事業所可奏效，必須力圖發展。更鑒於歐美各國國民對於防癆工作，罔不各致其力，彼昔日深受癆病之害者，今已大為减削，而其成功之最大原因由於防癆團體之組織縝密，各地人民之踴躍贊助；中華民族，亦豈後人？愛經公决：自二十四年四月六日起，廣徵會員，同赴事功，衆擎易舉，宏效可期，謹揭徵求入會之意義如左：</p>
<p>一　民族方面之關係我國同胞之死於癆病者，年約一百六十萬人，患者約一千六百萬人，及今不圖勢必年甚一年，實為民族前途最大之禍害，吾人旣係民族一分子，焉可不盡一分之責任任</p>
<p>二　國家方面之關係國人因受前述癆病之侵襲，故體力萎靡，國勢不振，滅亡之禍，迫在眉睫。旣係國民一份子，焉可不盡一分之負任！</p>
<p>三　社會經濟方面之關係患癆而死之人，自其出生以至葬埋，一切費用，假如每人已費一千五百元，則年死一百六十萬人，卽我整個之社會經濟，每年耗損二十四萬萬元，其數已可驚人，而不克工作之患癆者一千六百萬人，旣可能增加社會經濟之生產力，反徒為社會經濟之耗費者，一出一入，其於整個社會經濟之損失，更難數計，故我國社會經濟因癆病之害而受損者，每年至少在數十萬萬元，協助防癆，足以維持社會經濟，亦卽所以减少自身直接或間接之損失，旣為社會一份子，焉可不盡一分責任！</p>
<p>四　人類道義方面之關係吾人偶見任何動物受傷成疾病痛苦，未有不惻然而生憐憫之情者，今旣知悉每年有一百六十萬人因癆病而死，有一千六百萬人被困於癆病之中，更念已死者遺族之孤苦伶仃，患病者家屬之憂急焦思，其悲哀苦慟為何如耶！本人類互之道義，焉可不盡一分之責任！</p>
<p>或謂入會意義，固如所言，究於防癆之實際功效若何，則應之曰：同志愈多，功效愈宏，左卷可操，無待猶豫，謂予不信，請査各國癆病率與癆病死亡率降低之經過，當知本會所期之不虛也，邦人君子，盍興乎來。僅此宣言。</p>
<h3 id="c197">敬告全國各界領袖參加防癆事業書 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 顏福慶</p>
<p>我國人每以癬疥之疾，為不須注意，多因此斷送終身而不自知，此種見解，旣足以自誤誤人，又足以影響國計民生，他勿論矣，請以癆病言之；癆病之入人體，起於微漸，病者不察，或以為風寒，忽於診療，或以為火熱，亂投凉劑，以致國人被其斷送生命者，年達一百六十萬人，此一百六十萬人，又皆壯年生產份子，其直接間接影響於國家人口經濟上，其損失蓋不可以數量計：不僅如此，尙有傳染子女者者，謂之童子癆，有延至四十以上纏綿床第而終身不愈者，謂之終身癆。試想此種不生不死之人數又若干？言之誠足驚人！現據各方報告：此病者每十萬人中佔四千人，我國人口以四萬萬計，則全國有一千六百萬人。以此一千六百萬之癆病專家，又復彼此傳播，年年遞增，則我國整個民族，不待人之亡我，我亦無以自存於天地間矣。試想此又是何等可怕可慘之事耶！</p>
<p>中國防癆協會有鑒於此，爰於二十二年十月聯合各界同志組織成立。其目的在喚起國人知癆病之嚴重性，起而注意，起而預防，起而抵抗；又對於已病者，予以實行補救之治療，導其攝生之方法，自成立以來，為期雖甚暫，而所辦之事工，差幸亦略具規模（詳見本會工作報告）當茲年會之際，檢閱過去，策勵將來，益覺防癆事業與國家人口經濟關係之重大，為貫澈初衷，增進民族健康計，愛訂三年計劃，以期逐步推進，從速實現，惟茲事體大，非少數人之力所能達到，尙冀各界領袖，登高一呼，庶眾山皆應、合衆策羣力以赴之，俾得完成此盛舉區區之意。想為關心民　者，樂於贊助乎。</p>

<p>— 張君俊</p>
<p>本會由上海市長吳鐵城先生聯絡中外各界領袖曁醫界鉅子，共同發起，於民國二十二年十月二十二日假霞飛路市府招待處舉行成立大會，到會者有吳鐵城孔鮮熙王曉籟劉鴻生牛惠生李廷安許世英等二百五十餘人，首由吳鐵城演講，大意謂；癆病的為害，人盡知之，我國人死於此病的，每年約一百六十餘萬，患病的人，差不多有一千萬以上，而且大都是壯年生產份子，影響於社會經濟，非常的鉅大！在五十年以前，歐美許多國家，他們的癆病猖厥情形，也和我國不相上下，但是因為他們預防得法，遂使癆病的死率，一落千丈。例如英國在一八七五年，癆病的死亡率是十萬之三百弱，現在已經降至七十左右，這就是防癆成效的證據。現在我國的死亡率，據調査所得，超過英國六倍以上，而且十四歲以下的兒童，受到它的傳染者，竟有百分之四十，假使再不積極預防，那末，民族民生，何堪設想呢？因此之故，所以特地聯絡在滬中外名人，及醫界鉅子，共同發起中國防癆協會，籌謀預防的方法，俾得強健民族的體魄，但是這件事情，非常重大，非羣策羣力，作有步驟的規劃，籌健全的組織，實在不易收效。今蒙各界領袖，踴躍參加，將來本會的發展，一定是無可限量。吳鐵城演講畢，卽討論各項進行事宜，及會員種類，常經議决，凡志願加入本會者，均得為會員，不分性別，不分國籍，其類別則分為二種，（一）團體會員，以合法團體為限，（二）個人會員，分普通會員，維持會員，永久會員，學生會員四種。繼乃推選名譽會長，常務理事，監事曁理事等人選。當推吳鐵城為名譽會長，劉瑞恒孔庸之夫人，王曉籟，虞洽卿，徐新六，為副名譽會長，牛惠生為理事長，李廷安為副理事長，朱恒璧，顏福慶，伍連德，吳鐵城，布美，蕭智吉夫人，J.A.Snell等為常務理事。杜月笙，丁福保，梁小初，陸伯鴻，史量才，蔡香蓀，龐京周，褚民誼等為監事，劉鴻生，鄺富灼。陸幹臣，黃任之，林康侯，顧毓琦，朱慶瀾，吳蘊初，丁淑靜，李登輝，許建屏，郭順，許世英，董顯光，胡筠秋，潘公展，李祖蔚，金叔初，盧永春，刁信德，陳志方，陳萬里，李大超，譚世鑫，王淑貞，何熾昌，金寳善，劉王立明，吳醒亞，王孝英，胡宣明，宋國賓，錢慕韓，J.RaberfS.M.Gurn.G.R.FitcbC.M.Van　Allen.　J.　H.　Jordan.　E.　C.　Lobenstin等為理事。以上一切，係全國靑年協會幹事楊懷僧先生負責進行，楊君對於公衆事業，一向非常熱心，自從擔任臨時幹事後，卽擘劃一切，分途進行，始具規模。以上是本會成立的經過，茲將本會年來的工作槪况，分述於后：</p>
<p>（一）改聘職員　二十二年十二月十四日張君俊先生被聘為本會總幹會，並聘李兆璋先生等輔助一切，楊君卽將各項事務，交代張李二先生負責，職員旣經聘定，工作遂開始進行　　（二）舉行第一次徵求會員大會　同年十二月十五日晚假香港路銀行公會公宴各界領袖，幷舉行第一次徵求會員大會，卽席推出正副男女隊長及本會負責人張君俊李兆璋等共八十餘人，各隊長分頭進行，熱心介紹，加入者異常踴躍，成觀頗有可觀　　（三）招待新聞界　一月十二日下午四時，假八仙橋靑年會招待本埠新聞界，並開放防癆電影，到會者有衛生局長李廷安，紅十字會醫院院長顏福慶市府科長李大超曁各報社記者四十餘人，首由顏主席致詞，次由李廷安演講最後茶會，並放映防癆敎育影片，對癆菌之生長與療治，闡發甚為詳盡，直至下午六時許，始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>（四）招待敎會領袖　一月十九日下午四時，在本會招待敎會領袖會議，到會者有廷安，賴斗岩，朱恒璧，張維，田璀賓，屠保羅等多人，由李廷安主席，致開會詞，次由賴斗岩張維醫師演說，略謂國人患癆病者甲於全球，人材之凋耗，療養之靡費，其損失遠過於每年之內戰，吾人應極力注意公共與個人衛生，免使癆病再有蔓延，繼由張君俊報吿會務，隨卽舉行茶會，並由柯達公司吳增貴放映防癆映片六時許散會</p>
<p>（五）防癆播音演講　一月起至三月止，先後敦請顏福慶院長，李廷安局長翁之龍校長，布美醫生，張維醫生並張君俊等假福音廣播電臺講演預防癆病及療養之方法，積極宣傳，深得市民之注意，又去年冬繼續敦請專家演講，並派員前往各大中學宣傳民族之健康，為防癆之方法，去年統計，講演達五十次，每次聽衆，約一百至千二百人，足見各方對於癆病問題注意之一斑也。</p>
<p>（六）舉行募捐運動　三月十五日由本會名譽會長吳鐵城歡宴本市各界名流，同時舉行募捐運動，結果甚為圓滿。蔣介石先生，聞蘭亭先生，杜月笙先生，史量才先生，劉峙先生等無不踴躍輸將，促成本會事業實現，其急公好義之精神，實屬難能可貴，除此之外，復得各聞人各理事各團體，廣為徵募，前後共收到捐欵及會費等二萬一千八百九十五元九角二分，本會事工，乃能次第實現。　　（七）設立癆病診療所　本會為適應社會之需要及謀民衆之健康起見，於六月十四日在西門方斜路西林路口三零六號創立第一癆病診療所，本减輕民衆負擔之目的，負慈善救濟之使命，故不收診費藥費，成立以來。市民前往診病者截至十二月底止，計有初診二百九十三人，復診六百三十四人，市民忠病之衆，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>（八）護士訪視病家　本會自第一診療所成立後，卽聘租篠培，沈宗英一一女士擔任護士工作，每日上午分別訪視病家，吿以預防及療養之方法，此種消息發出後，各病家紛紛要求護士前往癆病問題之嚴重，眞有不寒而慄之慨！</p>
<p>（九）舉辦兒童健康營六月中本會籌備夏令兒童健營，嗣以教育局衛生局兒童幸福會晨報社均要求加入合辦，故由五團體籌備於七月六日開營，報名加入之男女童兒凡六十人，關於經過槪况，日常生活，早巳公布報端，及刋載本會防癆雜誌，茲不多述。</p>
<p>（十）本會在上海市第十三屆衛生運動大會之工作情形去年六月十九日起為上海市第十三屆衛生運動大會之期，本會係屬防癆組，乃作規模偉大之防癆宣傳，計在大會一星期內先後敦請本市各領袖及各名流專分途講演防癆問題，每值講演，聽眾輒有五六百人踴躍情形，得未曾有。事前本會亦函請本市各醫院，並本市醫師公會，請轉註冊醫士，免費為市民檢査身體，半費照X光，皆蒙接受，計每日前往各醫士診病者甚眾，而各醫院如上海時疫醫院，廣仁醫院，中國紅十字會醫院，聖心醫院等二十三院，每日檢查身體照X光者多有應接不暇之勢</p>
<p>（十一）本會贈書經過　本會備有丁福保氏肺病指南肺病療養法，肺病預防法三書，共一千九百餘本。當即自去年一月五日起，廣為贈送。良以該書內容豐富，舉凡癆病之預防療養，以及患者應有之常識，無不具備，故消息傳出後，函索面索者，截至十二月底止，計贈出共有一千八百餘本之多，國人患病之衆，於此可見一班。現該書尚有餘存，</p>
<p>（十二）防癆雜誌問世　本會為使普及防癆敎育計，幾番籌備，於十一月一日發行防癆雜誌。承孔庸之，王世杰，陳公博，黃紹雄，劉瑞恒等先生題字贊助。復得全國醫界鉅子，担任特約編輯，出版後各界熱烈愛護，紛紛定閱，本會愧受之餘，此後更當繼續努力，用副各界殷殷之期望。　　（十三）舉行癆苗測騐　本會由第一診療所醫士湯書年負責舉行癆苗測騐，良以癆病一症，小孩最易發生，為使明瞭中國癆病之猖獗情形起見，故對於此項學術測騐。　　　行之必要。査結核菌素反應試騐　苗測騐）施於上海中學實騐小學、受測騐者凡三百八十五人，其年齡在五歲十六歲之間，其方法為ManfauxIntwcutaneous　Method上皮注射法所用分劑為O.T.roooo6　Gm.茲將該三百八十五人之試騐結果列表於后：</p>
<p>總數　陽性反應　陰性反應　陽性反應百分比</p>
<p>五歳以下　三　一　二　三三·三○％</p>
<p>六歳至十歳　一八○　九八　八二　五四·四○％</p>
<p>十一歳至十五歳　一九四　一五二　四二　七八·三五％</p>
<p>十六歳以上　五　四　一　八○·○○％</p>
<p>現上表，雖所騐人數不多，仍不足為結論，而學齡兒童對於結核菌素試騐，呈陽性反應之現象，因年齡之增加而受癆菌侵襲之數量亦漸增加。正與近年紅十字會高醫土所得結果不約而同。成人一過二十歲鮮有不受結核菌之侵襲者也。　　（十四）舉辦第二診療所本會鑒於癆病患者之多，且上海地廣人多，原有各家醫院，不足以供需求，特籌劃一切，積極添設癆病診療所，以利市民，現第三診療所已於四月二日正式開診。地址在南市　　（十五）鉅金添置X光鏡　為求便於治療癆病起見，特在美國訂購最新式X光一具，計國幣五千元，該機備為第二診療所之用，病者如欲檢査與相照，可逕往上海醫院本會第二診療所接洽也。　　（十六）本會之希望　防癆工作之能否發展，進行之能否順利，端視經濟能力多寡為轉移。本會各項工作，正在積極進行，祇以限於經濟，諸多未能實現。甚望各界熱心人士，踴躍輸收，或為會員，或代為徵募使本會事業蒸蒸日上，防癆工作，普及全國，非特民族前途之幸，本會亦與有榮焉。</p>

<h3 id="c199">清福 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>淸朝的愼郡王胤禧，是很會做做詩的，他曾經做過一首樵歌，道：</p>
<p>不聞人聲，但聞斧聲，寂寂岩馨答，丁丁飛烏驚。得柴換酒，醉歸踏月山歌淸；友木石，無衰榮，白雲流水自朝暮，萬山漠漠烟光靑。</p>
<p>「得柴換酒，醉歸踏月山歌淸；友木石，無衰榮，」這是淸福，是許多吃肉朋友所艷羨的。胤禧身為郡王，却很愛風雅，一任他的哥哥胤　——雍正去過皇帝癮，猜忌，禁壓，殺戮；而他却遊山玩水，吟詩作畫，大做其春浮居士。</p>
<p>他要享受淸福。</p>
<p>而且還把這淸福賞給了「友木石，無衰榮」的樵夫。「得柴換酒，醉歸踏月」，福氣的確很好，不過這只表現了才子們的閑情逸致。事實上，靠着二條臂膊，一柄板斧，天天在山上砍柴的樵夫，是並不懂得的。他們只知道得柴換米，飢歸踏月。但倘要這樣說，這就不能算是淸福，反倒有點像是淸苦了。</p>
<p>而淸苦是風雅之士所不樂道的。</p>
<p>不過樵夫們的沒有淸福可享，却還是事實。靠幾篇閑情逸致的詩文，也終於反不過案來，最大的證據是沒有錢。廬山避暑，鄧尉探梅，原也算得是淸福了，但廬山的樵夫仍舊要流汗，因為他還得工作；鄧尉的梅樹是只許觀賞，不准砍伐的，風雅之士的逸興，却碰碎了捏斧頭的樵夫們的飯碗。</p>
<p>淸福是這樣地成了窮人們的對頭。</p>
<p>然而在雍正看來，却還是値得提倡的。他曾經把自己的兄弟胤禩和胤　的名兒改為「阿其那」和「塞思黑」，「阿其那」者，滿語狗也，而「塞思黑」却是猪。這一狗一猪，因為結黨謀立，所以被雍正幽禁起來，要他們革去凡心，享些淸福。</p>
<p>胤禧的看花賞月，玩骨董，煮好茶，也許就是所謂「寄沉痛於幽閑」，然而他的淸福抹去眼前的事實，他也久已成為一望瞭然的「塞思黑」了。</p>
<h3 id="c200">窮戲班 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>有一次我聽見過關於一個窮戲班的可笑的故事。在塲的朋友笑得眼淚水都倘了出來，因為那個故事不單是形容了某個戲班底簡陋，同時說明了中國人底慾望靠着怎樣的供給而滿足——這好像也可以說明別的東西的。</p>
<p>說故事的人首先介紹那個肥胖的女班主。她坐在戲塲門口，她身邊擺着一個大竹籮；另外一個男伙計站在門口那一邊，他們兩個人手裏牽着一根草繩，看戲的客人把兩吊錢摔下竹籮裏，他們就放下草繩讓他走進去。</p>
<p>其次他介紹那個戲班底靴子。那兒只有一隻靴子，而有四個角色必須在觀衆面前露出右脚。這自然是困難的事。於是先頭走的那個有當然的權利把靴子儘先享受了。他走到台前，緩緩地踢出一脚，靴子赫然顯現出來了，於是把脚向後一彎，第二個要走上前來的角色就俯下身軀替他脫去那隻靴子——聽到這里的人都笑了。</p>
<p>他所講的是四川某一縣所發生的事情。但任何人都曉得這種情形在中國是普遍的。觀衆們到處都無大差別地表現出他們底忍耐力底可驚的程度。</p>
<p>我在廣東某一小鎭市裏也碰到過一個可憐的戲班。戲子都是上了年紀的人，鎭上的人民在誇傲他們自己有着這一班老藝術家的時候，便翹起大姆指，低聲呌嚷道：「眞鬚假牙」！在別的時候他們會咆哮地說出別的頌詞：「不是麼，官比兵多，兵比槍多，槍比子彈多！」</p>
<p>戲台上走出了大將，大槪是一個主帥，口裏吆喝着：「衆將官」！旁邊四五個鼓樂手就代表他底部下齊聲答應「有」！其實做戲的只是一個人。後來我知道了，班裏頭的好角色不肯扮演小卒，怕失了身份，而壞的角色是一個也沒有的。</p>
<p>小姐出台沒有了鬟，在需要使喚的時候，鼓樂手那邊就臨時發出被勉强壓迫出來的假女性底應聲。</p>
<p>從前廣東舞台劇底規矩，演戲一直要繼續到天亮。兩三點鐘以前演着所謂精彩的一部份，以後就是拖延戲，台上隨便做，台下一面打瞌睡一面看，在等天亮罷了。</p>
<p>有一次演完一齣「山東响馬」！他們呌做「戲肉」的—之後，我看見從後台走出了一個自稱欽差大臣的角色，要提一個女犯來審問。沒有差人，沒有獄卒，甚至沒有女犯人，台上只有一張棹子，一塊驚堂木，和欽差大臣他自己。</p>
<p>虛擬的女犯大槪是一個興兵作亂的海賊底女人，美麗而有節氣。欽差大臣開頭作威作福地破口大駡，說她「不自歛迹，屢煩天討」，用砍殺來恐嚇她；後來看見她長得漂亮，又嘻皮笑臉地調戲她，要跟她講戀愛，有「順我則生，不順則死」的警句。他底兇暴的神氣，戀愛底手腕，有時看來却也十分可怕。一到天亮，他便不管那女犯肯不肯，自己說着，「現在天己大白，戲要做完，你且跟我到後堂睡覺可也！走了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">喜劇 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 黑櫻</p>
<p>深沉的夜，街上已經沒有聲息，顯得異樣的寂聊。西北風呼呼地吹，站在角第裏的巡捕用衣領掩蓋着兩耳，腿在不住地顫抖。街路慘淡地照着挺直的柏油馬路。一陣旋風似地，戲着歸家的倦遊的人捲了過去，一剎那聞就消失了。一家通宵的廣東館子裏留下幾個人在靠着火爐吃着蝦肉雲呑，一邊望着悽淸的馬路，連回家的勇氣也沒有那樣地不想走出來。黃包車停在門外；那中年的車夫睜着無神的眼睛望着熱氣騰騰的雲呑被送到別人的口裏去，猛地覺得自家肚子也有點餓呢，便有一股涎沫湧上嘴角來，非常地難過。</p>
<p>「儘瞧人家吃東西麽？你眞是混賬傢伙！」</p>
<p>不知道誰用諷刺的口吻說著這樣的話。那混賬傢伙忙咽下了一口唾水，回轉身來找說話的人。呈現在他面前的全是一副帶着鄙視人的陰暗的笑；那坐在車扛上的江北小伙子啣着半截烟，正對着他擺出奸滑的神氣。他想找這小伙子發一次脾氣，可是不行；他應當忍耐一下。</p>
<p>「媽媽的——」他也不知道駡誰。</p>
<p>這時候，遠遠地有一輛人力車拉向這裏來了。車墊上坐的是××水兵，載着一頂圓帽子，　身上穿的是有大領子的海軍制服。他把兩隻脚架了起來，差不多每隔兩分鐘就踢一下車夫的背脊，馬樣咬緊牙根往前跑着的車夫，脚步聲在深沉的夜裏淸晰地響了起來，送到每一個人的耳鼓裏。他的心裏跳躍着，有無數的石子在那裏起伏不停似地，他想今夜又遇着魔鬼了。一直往前——究竟這傢伙要上那裏去呢？他好像喝過不少酒；有時喃喃地在囈語；從不對車夫說要上什麽地方去。拉了快半個鐘頭了吧，毫無目的地跑，他實在不曉得要有怎樣的結局。冷汗在身上冒了出來；他並且急得想哭了！</p>
<p>忽然他的背脊上着了不能忍受的一脚，幾乎撲在馬路上；而車上的水兵却暴躁地咭咕起來，好像車去做錯了什麼事那樣地大聲呌駡着。但是他駡的什麼沒有人聽得懂。這時車子正在廣東館子的門前，立即有些好事的人捨了他們的雲呑或者魚生粥走出來看熱閙。剛才為了吐子飢餓而垂口涎的漏　傢伙和一些車夫們也站在一塊兒等着他們的同伴被××水兵侮辱得哭了起來。</p>
<p>車子停了。</p>
<p>「喂，什麽事呀！」江北小伙子問着。「哭了哩！××鬼子還打他，豈有此理！」</p>
<p>「他媽的！」</p>
<p>××水兵用着拳頭和皮靴毆打着那身材矮笨的，一點反抗也沒有的黃包車夫。旁邊看的人呢，沒有同情，沒有義憤，全都像看電影般地木然站在那裏。被打傷了的車夫用乞憐的眼睛帶着懇求向他的同胞們望着；可是沒有誰給他一點反應。……</p>
<p>店裏的伙計站在門口，「看吓，多有趣！他一面呌着，一面把裏邊的賬房也拉了出來。</p>
<p>「你還說有趣！車夫已經跪在地上求饒了。」賬房先生用手移動了一下近視眼鏡，沉重地說</p>
<p>是的，那黃包車夫被侮辱以後不是反抗，而是討饒。他用着那麼可憐的姿態，奴才似地跪在水兵面前，低微地喚叫着：「老爺…××大老爺！…僥了我這條命吧！」因為他知道那「大老爺」甚至可以用刀刺死他的，所以駭怕得臉上現着靑菜般的顏色，這樣地求着寬赦。</p>
<p>而那××水兵却滿足了，大笑起來。跟着瀑布一樣宏亮的笑聲，觀衆也破口而笑了。</p>
<p>「蠢東西，還不起來逃命嗎？」有人用脚尖輕輕觸醒那受罪的人。</p>
<p>「天啊……」</p>
<p>喊呌着，爬起身來，他趕快拉起車子快步地逃開了。</p>
<p>巡捕這時候才走來，扯着看熱閙的人問：『這是什麼一回事？」可是，沒有人回答他。三分鐘內人都散去了，有的回到廣東館子裏把留在桌子的半碗魚生粥吃下去；江北小伙子駡着××鬼子，然而他不敢帮助剛才那被侮辱的人。勝利了的水兵衝進一家酒吧間去了；街上又剩下西北風吹着，街燈冷淸地照着，一切都平靜得不曾有過什麽騷動一樣。……</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>遊湖雜寫之一</p>
<p>早晨起來，人非常高興，但是一望到陰雲重重的天空，可是掃興極了；因為這樣一來，遊起西湖是不合適的，而今天正是預定好起程去西湖的日子。</p>
<p>不管，終於帶了舖蓋坐上一部上車站去的黃包車。</p>
<p>五六年了，住在上海，但是却沒有去過西湖，這是多麼自引為憾的事情！上海西湖距離這樣近，不去逛逛，顯見人太懶了。</p>
<p>到車站，我要加入的團體二十幾個人已經先來了，一羣學生們蹦蹦跳跳的，那歡樂而又急迫的情形，彷彿能够立時到西湖才好。他們一方面抱怨天氣惡劣，一方面又懼怕落雨，幸好，一直到上車後，雨還不曾落，反而太陽過一會大大方方冒出頭來。人人都是喜笑顏開的。</p>
<p>火車開了，沒有事作，打開一本「小品文和漫畫」看，本來有一個習慣，坐火車寗願看沿路的景物，不願看書，那怕就是看些平淡的田陌和野草也好；但這一回，從北站一直到嘉興，因為我已經走過兩三次，路上比較熟習些，所以來取個巧。我决定好，車過嘉興再看車窗外的風景。</p>
<p>天不從人願，火車還不曾開到新龍華站，太陽就已讓陰霾遮住了光明，等到過嘉興之後，竟然下起絲絲的小雨了。</p>
<p>「眞倒霉，到底下起雨來」。</p>
<p>「老天眞不從人願，為哈故意和人為難」！</p>
<p>「一連下了好幾天，也該放晴了，儘落雨，條落」！</p>
<p>車廂中，有些人在發散着怨言。</p>
<p>天氣漸漸冷起來，把棉袍子穿起，這衣服早上本不打算帶，不想還正用得到。玻璃窗上的雨點慢慢加多，視綫被遮住了，外面景物看不淸楚了。</p>
<p>總算運氣好，雨雖然遮住了車窗外的風景，車廂裏倒很有些煞風景：一些上海××學院的學生，他們在扮演不收票價的文明戲，這些大學生們，有一部分是屬於畢業的，（單有個旗幟呌什麽「畢業考察團」？的），還有一部分雖未畢業，但也都在等着戴方帽子，他們故作怪聲怪像，賣弄色相，因為是男女都有，這中間的趣味就更顯得濃重了，而且好戲不怕連臺，人家自然願看，所以是熱鬧非常。</p>
<p>看看我身旁坐着的一羣中學生，不行，差得遠，只會呆呆地看別人扮戲，自己却扮不出，這大概就是程度不到的關係吧。我暗祝這些看戲的中學生們快快上進，等進了大學之後，再來西湖遊玩也在車中扮演一幕滑稽喜劇。</p>
<p>雨愈落愈大了，不，愈密了，但並不大，也不急，到杭州，還不停止，一邊下火車，一邊為明天遊湖的事情擔憂，只要有人敢担保明天能晴天，念十遍阿彌陀佛我都情願，絕對不嫌麻煩。</p>
<p>我們一羣人乘上黃包車向女子中學進發了，這裏是我們的臨時投宿處。</p>

<p>嚴冬壓過了他們的饑饉，債主暫時疏了脚跡；鋤頭趕去了疲倦，一年一度，又是春天！水光耀貫着田疇，細雨喚起了它們的生命，斗笠，蓑衣，裝起興奮，泥汚埋去了脚脛，一動一動的找着生命。希望透上了心坎：『該不是去歲一樣的年成吧』？</p>

<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>校長先生雖然年靑，主意可很好：罷課。他架着一副金絲脚玳瑁框的平光眼鏡，長袍外加西裝褲皮鞋，提着剛變了童音的喉嚨，對學生慷慨激昂地演說：『各位，小朋友，回去，吿訴家裏：本來，我們應當，老早開課；可是，前校董，不肯移交，沒有開辦費，所以我們祇好不開課！我們應該打倒這種……這種……「反動份子」！』</p>
<p>—事情就這麼僵着。</p>
<p>不到兩三天，這消息秋風似的吹遍了全鎭，學生的父兄們縐着眉頭；一般墊師們却到處興味地向人打聽這件事，咧開了嘴巴聽人講，又對人講着。</p>
<p>巨卿先生也有點興奮起來了。他對這事情不祇是感到了隔岸看火的快意；他知道，要是事情閙下去，也許會給他一點什麽好影響的。——近幾天，一到放晚學的時候，巨卿先生三角形的猴子臉就常常在街上出現了。</p>
<p>這天傍晚，巨卿先生正在暮色蒼茫的東街沿跑着，預備去看朋友打聽消息。忽然迎面來了一個穿藍布長衫，頭戴湯鍋氈帽的老頭子，對巨卿先生拱一拱手說：</p>
<p>「啊呀，先生！眞凑巧，我正要去拜望你。」</p>
<p>一聽聲音，是東街沿裕興油醬店的醬油福店王。他緊接着拉了巨卿先生的手臂，跑進一家小酒店去。</p>
<p>一小碟花生，一小碟豆腐干，在黝黯的「靑龍脾」後面的「雅座」上坐下來了。醬油福店王說：</p>
<p>「先生，你曉得嗎？我的小店被學堂封門了。」</p>
<p>這消息，巨卿先生是剛聽見人說了的；但是他做了個很驚愕的表情：「哦，為什麼？」</p>
<p>醬油福店王咳了一聲，吿訴他：裕興的店屋是區立小學校的產業，向學堂裏租下來的，去年商會會長褚潤夫當校董，今年三月的房租都收去了；今年章嘯峯重新上了毫，却又向福店王逼着要收，回答已經交給前校董了，沒效果，校長先生不分靑紅皂白，說他們是有意拖欠，破壞敎育。一封公函到鎭上公安分局，裕興油醬店就當天關了門，貼上了十字交义的封條。——</p>

<h3 id="c247">短波交通之跳躍距離 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>短波無綫電交通，以其能於小電工率之下，而成功長距離之通訊，遂為無綫電界所重視；又以其優於長波之特點頗多，時至今日，短波交通，遂有取長波而代之之趨勢。吾人對此進展亟速之短波交通，安能漠然不加以注意？</p>
<p>短波推進之特性至饒興趣，其最顯明之現象而為短波交通所不能忽視者，卽通常所謂『跳躍距離』（Skip　distance）是也。考短波之推進，因其週率之高，沿地面遞進之電波被地面吸收，能力衰减極速，僅及三五十英里之短距離，卽已微弱至不能辨：故短波不若長波，其沿地面前進之部份，除極短距離之交通外，不能適用。短波所賴以交通者，全藉其向天空發射部份，此一部份電波直擊天空之海氏層（Heaviside　layer），因海氏層具有反射能力，故能由海氏層而反射至地面。此反射電波所達距離頗遠，遂為短波交通所利用。但在地面直射波所及與海氏層反射波所達之中間，隔有一段距離，在此段距離內，沿地面推進之電波，旣早消滅，而反射之電波，又超越而過，於是遂寂然無音信。此段距離因名之日跳躍距離。故在跳躍距離內裝設接收機，必不能收得音訊，是為短波交通之一大缺點。</p>
<p>跳躍距離與波長，電波仰射角度，及海氏層之高度電子密度等，有深切之關係。跳躍距離之隨波長晝夜時日季節而變遷者，不為無因。據理論與實騐之結果，得有如下之關係：</p>
<p>（一）波長　在同一海氏層高度之下，跳躍距離係隨波長减少而增加，有如圖一所示。據實騐所得，一百英里高度之海氏層，用八〇公尺之波長可望無跳躍距離；用四〇公尺之波長，跳躍距離約為一百英里；用二〇公尺之波長，跳躍距離約為五百英里；用十公尺之波長，跳躍距離則增至一千至兩千英里。對二二五英里高之海氏層，用八十公尺之波長，似仍無跳躍距離；倘波長减至四〇公尺，則跳躍距離約為二〇〇英里；二十公尺則有一千英里；至用十公尺之波長，則發射電波深進海氏層，永不能返還地面。五百英里高之海氏層，用八十公尺之波長，已略有較短之跳躍距離；波長减至四十公尺，則距離增至四百英里；至二十公尺波長，旣不能折回。超短波所以不能作長距離之通訊者，卽以此故。跳躍距離與波長有如此之關係。故在某地可收聽四十公尺之音訊，而不能收聽同地所發出三十六公尺波長之音訊，固有其因。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c248">增加變重電容器量的簡便方法 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>增加變量電容器容量的方法很多，但是這裏所講的法，比較上可以說最簡單，最經濟。因為我們知道，二組金屬片中間用絕緣物隔開，就成為一個電容器；這電容器的容量是和這絕緣物的絕緣常數（Dielectric　Constant）成正比的。所以我們只要換用另一種絕緣常數較大的絕緣物，就可以把容量增大了。</p>
<p>空氣的絕綠常數是一，雲母是四，六到八，臘是二到二·五，磁是四·四，石英是四·五，松香是二·五，洋乾漆是三·一，普通玻璃是三·一到四，電木是五到六。</p>
<p>譬如現在要把一個〇〇〇一的空氣絕緣式變量電容器增加為〇〇〇二五　法拉特的容量，那麽我們只要用臘把這電容器金屬片間的空隙全部灌滿，就行了。假使要增加的不到〇〇〇二五，那麼臘就相當的少灌些。</p>
<p>總之，要增加很大的容量，就採用絕緣常數較大的絕緣物，且把全部金屬片間的空隙塡滿；否則，就用常數較小的絕緣物，而僅塡於一部份的空隙內。詳細數目，最好試騐决定。</p>

<p>— 曹潤生</p>
<p>最近有一位朋友呌我替他裝一隻交流放揚聲器的收音機，我想這又是一個實騐的機會到了，所以一口答應下來。我因為曾經聽得朋友說過Megadyne式綫路很可靠，所以就選了下面的綫路。足足費了一個半天的光陰，才把它裝好。將信將疑地挿上電源開起來聽。眞使我喜得跳起來、果然能將本埠各大小電臺一在揚聲器中放出來。音量足與普通三管機比美，至於選擇性，因為加了濾波器，所以也很可觀。我想這張綫路，對於業餘同志一定也很需要，所以特地介紹出來，尙望業餘同志將試騐後之成績宣佈出來，則不勝幸甚</p>

<h3 id="c250">配準揚聲器母磁塲線圈的耗阻的簡便方法 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>商品收音機裏面的揚聲器的母磁塲線圈（Field　Coil），是兼做代乙電裏的濾波阻流綫圈的，所以均有一定的耗阻値，不能隨便更動，否則輸出的乙電壓就會發生變化，而影響到收音機的工作。因為這原故，有時母磁塲綫圈損壞了，一時配不到相同耗阻的揚聲器，那麽整架收音機就得擱置不用。</p>
<p>逢到這種困難時，可以下面的方法來解决。只要把原機的揚聲器拆去，而換上如附圖的二件東西。圖中的L是一個新換上的電力揚聲器的母磁塲綫圈，它的耗阻比此機中的小些；R是一個十瓦特的綫繞耗阻器，他的耗阻値與L相加，應該等於原來的擴聲器的母磁塲綫圈的耗阻。倘這樣改接後，有交流聲發生，則應該加接圖中的虛綫部份。C是一個紙質固定電容器有二兆分法拉特的容量，耐壓和這收音機中代乙電部份的濾波電容器相同</p>
<h3 id="c251">初進同志應具之知識（一）（續） <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 楊學綸</p>
<p>（三）電容器　收音機中調節週率，常用變量電容器擔任之，此電容器宜用空氣絕緣與直綫週率者，吾人在裝配單管收音機時，雖祇需用一隻變量電容器，但預備將來擴充時之需要，可預購一雙連或三連者，並配一適宜之緩旋刻度盤，此種電容器，切勿購用劣貨，因其旣易碰片，且兩電容器之電容量不能同步，雖有補償器，終致顧此失彼以致裝成後困難百出，除廢棄重購外，別無補救之方法，所以在購買之時，切宜留意，變量電容器之容量，普通為00035與〇〇〇5兆分法拉，前者因所需初次級綫圈之比率較多，所以效率亦較高，固定電容器除用於濾波之外者，宜用雲母絕緣之電容器，以免損失。</p>
<p>（四）綫圈　本文所述之綫圈，包括高低週率變壓器，檢波綫團，及高低週率阻流圈，假定吾人所希冀之收音機，為一級高放，一級檢波，及一級低放，則高放與檢術二綫圈，可用蛛網板繞之，因其效率確較高於圓筒式綫圈者，設高週率放大須用至二級以上，則因地位關係，不得不用圓筒式綫圓圈，且高放級數加多，倘稍有損失，亦不覺之矣，自製綫圈，最好用絲包綫，漆包綫雖亦可用，然不可拆改，因一經拆改後，其絕緣漆卽有脫落處，故不可用，繞製綫圈時，寗先多繞數圈，太多拆下，否則，接綫加繞，旣損美觀，且减效率，低週率變壓器關係音質音量甚巨，必須用上等品，比率以3.5:1最適宜，高週率阻流圈應購用分叚繞法者，如亞美中雍之出品，否則，寗可勿用，低週率阻流圈須視其用處而注意其感應量與所能通過之電流値，</p>
<p>（五）耗阻　耗阻分為變量與固定二種，論其質料，亦有炭質與絲繞之別，大抵炭質用於高阻値，絲繞用於低阻値，高阻値之可變電阻，亦名為電位器，常作調節音量或控制電壓之用，此器亦宜用上等者，高阻値之固定電阻，卽柵漏，其値不可執泥於綫路圖上所註明者，可用一至四兆歐姆更換試騐，常可得較佳之結果，低於兆歐姆之炭質電阻，多作降壓之用，廠家常塗各種色漆於其外以標明其數値，購買時須注意歐姆與瓦特二値，絲繞變量電阻，多數用於控制燈絲電流，固定者則屬於丙電阻及分壓器二者之應用，（未完）</p>

<p>— 劉立</p>
<p>南田山在靑田縣南百二十里，道書稱為第四福地，廣袤二百餘里，中多平疇，上山皆峻嶺，出水俱飛泉，全山之水，百澗交匯，由五口出之。（東西南北各口外又有東北口）口皆峯巒峭削，雄秀無匹，飛瀑尤為巨觀，有高千尺上者凡三處，百尺計者為數甚夥。南田鄉居全由之最中，遊山者到南田鄕分日覽勝，飲食起居，較為安適。入山之路有四；（一）靑田城趁航船至白巖，計程八十里，一日可達，僱輿入山，由東麓之萬阜口上石梯嶺，半日抵南田鄉，計程五十里。（二）靑田城僱舟溯小溪直達嶺根，計程百十里，舟中一宿，越日上鶴口嶺。（九嶺之一）至劉文成公故里之武陽村，凡二十里，再十里到南田鄉，途程雖較遠，風景以此為最。（三）靑田城乘輿經大嶺阜到南田鄉，百二十里，一日半可達，為程最近，惟沿途風景無多。（四）瑞安城趁早班小輪到平陽坑，三小時計程七十里。僱輿經　口到大譽，凡一日計全程百四十里，再乘輿上大會嶺，三小時可到。新亭山中最著之百丈　，卽在左近，又三十里抵南田鄕，綜計全山峯凡三十有二，以萬仭，石圃，亢五，武陽，為最勝。瀑以百丈際為最雄壯，穿梁瀑為最奇巧，洞則以北口之水簾為最佳。端木太鶴遊南田詩，有深山五月有羊裘之句，山高氣爽，為避暑名區，遊山時期，以夏季為最適宜也。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>從外面回到家裏，放下了講義夾，便開始有一個墨黑的苗條的影子跟在身邊，含着淸淡的蕙蘭的幽香，一點因肝氣而蒸發的煩跺，是會自然的平和下去的，在家裏，妻總愛穿着玄色的綿綢長衫兒，玄色統襪，玄色皮鞋，　脚下面露出一對玄色的耳墜子，貼着白晳的腮膀兒，那樣明晰的面部輪廓和綽約的風姿，會呌一個因工作而疲倦了的身子重行奮發，可是，妻所給予我的安慰還不止這一些呢。</p>
<p>朋友都說我是幸福的—家庭間的幸福的丈夫，我自己亦這麽承認着，外衣是不用自己脫的，坐定的時候，便有一杯濃淡適中的雨前茶和一支我所愛吸的烟捲，從伊手裏親遞到面前，吃飯的時候，有一碟伊親煎的荷包蛋和一碗親煮的莼菜湯，伊彷彿做了我的胃蟲，伊有着和我同樣的舌頭，同樣的心情，可是，伊却比我有耐性得多，我在發怒的時候，伊坐在半邊微微地笑。</p>
<p>「你這樣馴服下去，你做了你丈夫的奴隸了！」有人對伊這麽挑撥似的說。然而，是不為所動的。伊依然馴服在我的面前。晚上，沒一次見妻獨個子先上牀睡眠，有時回家晏了，伊會伏在我的寫字檯上打磕睡，我對之眞是又羞慚又悔恨，因此，我常常强制我自己早點回去，不是嗎，妻子正預備着許多安慰的動作和言語，等待着我去接受。</p>
<p>「我情願馴服於一個忠實的丈夫，一直到死」。妻曾經這樣說過一句。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>待到顏色染好，絲也晒乾，成績巳到了很滿意的地步；於是這些絲便從架子上一一取下，再用那些木制的錠子，分別繞將起來，大概總是每一種染色繞一個錠子。繞好之後，旣不用以織綢，便祇有留作繡花或縫衣的材料了；一時却用不到那麽許多，只能先行收藏着，待到縫工們需用的時候，再指明了顏色選去應用。</p>
<p>關於製絲的一部份工藝的叙述，可說是至此已盡了，接下去我們就要講到宮中的製鞋業了。雖然在宮內比較有一些地位的女性日常所穿的鞋子，都是由專任制鞋的藝工所製的；但宮中所以專門供養着這些藝工的主要目的，却實在是為着太后一個人。因此，本文的叙述，也以太后所御的鳳履為重心。</p>
<p>論到太后的鳳履，讀者別以為是一個很小的小題目，如其原原本本的細講起來，眞有不少的字可寫咧！先說管理的一點：就有兩個太監，終年一事不做的專門給指定着為太后管理鳳屨；他們也並不覺得這項差使是輕差使，只覺得是十分的重大。他們一些也不敢懈怠，永遠小心翼翼地看管着這些鳳履、像看管什麽寳庫一樣。依着事實講，太后的鳳屐確也可算得是一種貴重的寳物；因為大多數的鳳屐上，都有價値極鉅的寳石，珠玉，或翡翠鑲嵌着，絕不是什麽平凡的東西。（二八六）</p>

<p>— 胡平</p>
<p>買不起書，唯有上書館去，圖書館是窮小子的施粥廠，（當然有錢的也能去）眞是大慈大悲，功德無量。不料有許多看書的才子，（或許佳人是不會的）專喜在書裏面，寫上幾行批評的字句，他們把圖書館裏的書富作了公厕所的牆壁，隨意品題，可謂有句皆奇，無語不妙；這裏隨便摘錄幾條，給大家奇文共欣賞一。</p>
<p>有一天，我找到了一本杜威著的「明日之學校」，有三行自來水筆寫的字：</p>
<p>「明日：學生坐在大講台上聽講，先生在矮凳上敎書。後日：學生出題目，先生做卷子。再後日：學校裏沒先生。」</p>
<p>我正在稱善哉，善哉！不料還有一頁書邊的空白上寫着：</p>
<p>「明日大中小學一律男女同學。後日，男女赤膊上課。再後日：男女裸體上課」</p>
<p>這二人倒也各有千秋。又在克伯屈的「敎育方法論」裏見到：「學校的方法，不外乎請名人作校董，自建洋房校舍，常常出來表演或跳舞，或參加宣傳喊口號而已矣。」</p>
<p>這都是事實，不過我以為這位先生是浪費筆墨。在芥川龍之介全集裏，有人題着一首詩：「菊池此日傳身後，夏目當年惜鬼才，一自河童成絕響，東都女兒有餘哀」。又在一冊「沙髯」上寫道：「人間哀樂吾能寫，才氣縱橫愧不如，聽得雪山獅子吼，骷髏帶血讀奇書」。兩詩俱佳，是一個人的筆跡；字也寫得很嫵媚。</p>
<p>安特列夫著「七個絞死的人」裏也有二行很滑稽的句子，一行是：「可憐。連我的嫂子成了八個！」另一行註云：「我的嫂子大眼睛，細脖子，活像個絞死鬼。」</p>
<p>最奇怪的是在「阿拍拉與哀綠綺思情書」中有人寫道：「和尙尼姑相好，有何希奇，咱們中國早就有啦！」讀之不覺失笑。</p>

<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>吃大菜（西餐之俗稱）斯嘗異味，輒與坐汽車住洋房同日而語，生活歐化，不亦樂乎！然有未諳其習者，每貽譏於大雅（亦作與爺字通，猶言寫意派之流）。此雖小道，蓋有宜誡諸端，其能嫻弗失儀者，所謂君子人（Gentleman）歟？不然，喫大菜有心取樂，閙笑話無處仲寃，値乎不値？猶憶童時面接美國海蘭女士口述各節，乃就其普通易蹈者記錄於次，並以私見參說焉：—</p>
<p>就餐之時母多談。—這和我國孔聖的遺訓「食不語」一樣意思，可見中外古今的事理很多有雷同處的。這用意多分是：你　在餐時講話，要使同席的人不得不勉强諦聽和應答敷衍，有誤吃的工程，—這是一種虐政！又，在餐時講話，不免要變更個人進餐的常態，譬如忽略咀嚼，加快吞嚥，减少食量等等，終於影響到人體的健康了。不過，現在大宴會時常有即席演講。的事，這可使同席聽衆得到的往往比損失的豐富些，又當別論了。</p>
<p>勿俯頸以喙就器。—獸類纔是把嘴凑到食物上去吃的。兩人的服裝中有硬領，大概就為維持頸項挺直的姿勢的作用。</p>
<p>刀尖切勿探入口中。—我國鄕下土右兒吃大菜割穿舌頭的笑劇，就因貊生沒有理會了這一戒條。</p>
<p>禁止刀义互擊，或擊器作聲。—這種聲響雖有聲音樂般的曼妙，也不是餐席上所需要的。漢劉邦得了天下，却不過他臣下們的再三請求，封他姪子為頡羹侯，祇為不忘他嫂子把湯杓敲擊鍋邊表示空無所有的舊惡惡，馮驩彈鋏歌嘆一食無魚」；所以這等食具的嗚聲雖未必都為表示不平，往往足以引起無謂的悮會，還是靜息一些的好。</p>
<p>刀义觸於盆底，發作若銼銅之響，使人聞之齒酸膚栗，最足取憎—這種銼齒般的聲音，怕是任何民族受不起，十分厭惡的！</p>
<p>勿作咀脣吮舌聲。—這是饕養的醜態，過分顯露他蹂躪食物的本領，自得其樂。也有在吃食時恣意大嚼，不自覺他口舌間釀出這種聲音來，好像是目鳴得意的節奏，使人聽了料測他不常能得豐盛的餐肴，帶來這種貧薄相。這種吃相在中國也是不行的。</p>
<p>進　勿作吸飲聲—聚蚊尙可成雷，聚餐時每人發出吸湯的大聲來，不要使人疑為洶湧的潮聲了麽？</p>

<p>浣花道：唉！李先生你是飽人不知餓人飢。像我們這樣的人有人正眼兒看我們兩下，已經是了不得，我們又怎敢再和人家談什麽條件？我這也不過哀求賈先生作點好事，順便把我帶回江南去。我沒有什麽報效他的，現在趕快就和他作媒。我想那朱家姑娘，總有他們的委屈之處，不便對男人說。我去了和他仔細一談，把他的心事掏了出來，然後就可以知道，要怎樣，他才可以心滿意足，辦的到，我們勸賈先生照辦。辦不到的，勸朱家姑娘鬆鬆手，這事不就成功了嗎？李士廉道：你這話倒是不錯。有些話，我們也想到了可是不便去對女孩子說。他那個母親不用提，根本是什麼也不知道，那位胡家嫂子呢，他又想從中發上一筆財，丟了別人的事，倒要先說說他的價錢，這事情，不說便罷，越說還是　麻煩。你的嘴倒是會說，我想，你肯出馬，這事凖可成功。浣花笑道：你又怎見得我的嘴會說呢？李士廉且不作聲，先向隔壁屋子努了一努嘴，這纔低聲細語道：這位先生，十二分的精明，平常的人，是不容不易動心的。可是……浣花向他連連的搖了幾下手，又抿嘴微笑了一笑。這時，隔壁屋子裏，已經有了嚮動，想必是賈多才已經起來了。李士廉有求於賈多才的事情、還多若呢，所以他也不便老在這裏說話，以至於犯了什麽嫌疑，立刻輕步走出屋來，才放重了脚步向賈多才屋子裏走去。隨後楊浣花重施了一回脂粉，也向這邊走來。（一七五）</p>

<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>春光明媚，眼前又是淸明節將到來了。這是一個一年中最好的節氣，學校中都放暇，山野裏隨處點綴着遊春的人們，公園裏也塞滿着人，人人面上，都有一股高興的勁兒。春季眞是一個快樂的季節。</p>
<p>最有意思的，是淸明掃墓，到鄉下，田野滿是飛着紙灰，掃墓的人，雖都是弔祭死人，但面上都有一點欣欣春意，實在是借此作為遊春的一種消遣，這樣說也未嘗不可以罷。</p>
<p>說起掃墓，我記起了前幾日報上所看到的中央决議的民族掃墓節。所謂民族掃墓節，就是由中央派員到西北去祭掃古代黃帝等的陵墓，以作為我們不忘民族始祖的一種紀念，故名之曰民族掃墓節。這是很有意思的，我國民族精神，至今確已衰亡垂盡了，國內布滿着外國人的鐵蹄與血痕，不紀念紀念我們民族老祖，這民族確將離覆滅不遠了。</p>
<p>可是恢復民族精神與民族力量，單靠一些精神上的紀念與回憶，似乎也還不够，最好，拿出我們的實力來，把這民族滿身所塗着的血痕與創痕，洗掃一個乾凈，那或者還有希望，這，我們於中央這次决定民族掃墓節之外，更希望有一種更有意思的舉動來給人民們去努力。</p>

<p>墳塲上，一些紙錢的灰燼隨着柳枝的拂動，與溪水的縐紋一同地，有節拍地飛揚起來了，把殘片的餘　散落在一些失了主的荒墓上而。四野是靜寂的，人能聆會得心臟的一跳，與遠處三兩聲的不知名的烏兒私話。</p>
<p>風過處，不知在那見把一兩聲低微的，迴蕩的哭聲帶來了—是對着那親切的死靈魂之追懷與憶念啊。從這裏邊，我彷彿聽到了一些人與人之間的友情之維憶的札記；也許是一個殘留在人間的靑年的孀婦，記憶着如夢的過去之戀情，而如今是，祇能倒在墓前的草堆裏，從嗚咽的哭泣中去找尋當年的櫻色的笑了吧？也許是；年靑的一代，在失掉了生存的勇氣與意義的一剎間，走到故往的親長前面追懷這死去了的一代的音容與感受，在沒有人可以接受的孤子的眼淚中去追思那和平的中世紀的情調吧？更或詐一些懷着更偉大，更有意義的某種理想的志士，在奮進的春光裏，却選定了這一個更適宜於追懷的日子，把血色的花朶來獻給這投身在光明裏，而最後却給無量的黑暗侵蝕了的朋友，一方面却在淚珠裏去淸算不適於讓人家知曉的一些偉大的，可怕的過往的苦難，與預估那些未來的，不可想像的大風暴吧？可是，誰知道呢？人與人中間的關係是神秘的，是無限的，是深遠得不可測量的啊！人生活着的時候按照着自己的方式儘可能地扮演了種種生的姿態，而當一個時候完成了生活的戲劇的任務，一下子向着作為自然界之後台的墳塲中鑽去的時候，一切的行動已組成了歷史的千萬份之一，而一切的友情呢？却只能在一個暗晦的春日，向那細雨濛濛的無聲息的墳塲中的低迥的哭聲中去找尋了呢。</p>
<p>難道說：就是這飄蕩在寒食時分之墓地間的千般的嗚咽，也是人世間的一種光榮嗎？</p>
<p>（從一些不知道的處所，杜鵑一聲兩聲地啼起來了，四野裏細雨濛濛地在落下。</p>
<p>眞想問一問：什麽地方才有打着杏黃旗子的，用人世間的眞實的笑來欵待人的酒家呢？）</p>
<p>泥路上漸漸地潤濕起來了，人踐踏着有一種泥濘的不愉快的感覺。小溪邊，柳條無聲息地拂著水面，桃花也星星地跳到水裏來了；趕路的人帶着一顆着急而忽忙的心，急急地從黏濕的土路上踏過去，望一望天，。灰色的，低籠的，沈悶而窒息的！於是伸過手去拂拭打在身上的雨天，不快意地獨個兒　咕着：「喝，沒帶傘，沒帶雨鞋油衣，好好的天，就平白地下起雨來了，誰料得到呢！誰料得到呢？怪！</p>
<p>土路上，獨輪車疎疎落落地行走着，車輪間歇地發出零落的，不愉快的刺耳的聲音，掃墓的人懷着一個冷落的心情歸來了，中年的僕人挑着殘肴與祭具，一聲不響地跟着走。已經是太陽歇在西山的時候了，慕色漸漸地昇起來，昇起來，籠罩了整個細雨濛濛的田野，什麼地方有烏鴉在晚噪。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個商店的小職員，已經二十二歲了。還沒有結婚。我的家庭是在鄉下，只有我一個獨自往在上海，所以在我的業餘時間，我的身體是很自由的。誰知道就因為這種自由才造成現在的問題啊！</p>
<p>我在不久以前，由於環境的引誘，以及種種的刺激，竟走到尋花問柳的路上去。不多時就遇到一位妓女，她性情很溫和，而沒有妓女們的淫蕩的習氣，我很愛她，她也看出我的老實；同時她自知墮落在這火坑裏，很難有出頭的希望，為終身幸福計，她便向我表示願意嫁我的意思，而我也了解她一切，覺得如是一個能耐勞苦的女子。所以我們由於感情的衝動，便白首的盟約現在婚約雖私自訂了，但是很多的問題，就跟蹤而至，使我很覺疑或不定。不知怎樣才好。</p>
<p>（一）此事未得家長同意，倘被他們發覺她是一個妓女，那末定要遭遇到強烈的反對。各親友如知道了，也一定不贊同，那時或者要影響我的位置。</p>
<p>（二）她做妓女，已經二年多了，不知在將來生育有沒有妨害？</p>
<p>（三）按照我現在的經濟能力，還不能負擔結婚的費用。而她卻肯再受一年的委屈，積蓄點錢，可以減輕我的負擔。但這種方法可以行嗎？</p>
<p>（四）假使一旦和她斷絕，那末心靈上的創痕，如何能消滅呢？</p>
<p>先生，因為有了這些問題，所以我便遲疑不決了。不知先生肯給我一個明確的指示嗎？敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　高雪清敬上</p>
<p>編者按：妓女在一般人的心目中是認為最下賤的人，因為她能使涉足花叢的青年墮落，使人傾家蕩產，身敗名裂。似乎是一種「不祥之物」。但這種罪惡並不是由妓女本身所造成的，她們是畸形社會下的產物，她們是經濟壓迫下的可憐蟲，我們本應要他們；但由於傳統觀念，深入人心，所以一般人對於她們便　很輕視了。</p>
<p>嫖妓宿倡，原是一種自甘墮落的行為，不足為訓。但現能倦遊知返，想找個對象來寄托他放浪的心靈，也未始非回頭的初步。所以和妓女結婚，我們雖不敬貿然贊同，但在特殊環境之下，也有可能性的。</p>
<p>高君信裏說，現在的經濟能力，還不能負擔結婚的費用。那末以往冶遊的費用，是從何而來？是否虧欠公欵？（此點雖不能肯定，但是迷途之時，就難免有這種行為了）如有之，應即儉箥自己的費用，設法彌補，以免日後發覺，那就置身無地了。</p>
<p>現在再來討論他的四個問題，第一個問題，消極的辦法是先把她贖身出來，假是她有家屬或親戚的話，她可以暫在她的親屬家裏，然後再經過正式手續結婚，好者妓女和良家婦女並沒有顯著的區別，一時不會揭露，等到木已成舟，那末家長也就不說什麼了。但從積極的方面說，只要你有婚姻自由獨立求生的能力，只要她嫁給你後，能夠始終如一的愛你，那末別人的輕視和攻擊，都不必去管它。第二個問題，應即請醫生加以鑑定。同時對於她的一切行為，也要詳細的觀察，以免有礙將來的幸福。第三個問題，是絕對不可行的。因為妓女的生活，如在火坑，安有救人於水火，而可以延遲的呢？并且「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，在這種惡劣的環境中，她的品格，也常常有變化地危險咧。至於經濟困難，那末只有節衣縮食的一法，好者你觀她是一個吃得苦的女子，也許不成問題的。</p>
<p>至於最後問題，根本就很矛盾，我們認為經考慮後而認為可娶的，則何必言絕，既認為不可娶，則根本失去了愛的基礎，即與之絕，也不至有什麼創痛的。</p>
<p>更正：本星期四所載手頭字稿，排錯甚多。如「穀」作「　」誤排為「槖」。「　」和「県」要互掉。「鴻」改作「鸿」「誠」作「诚」等等。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（十三）觀衆對於聲片的反響</p>
<p>當聲片剛發明的時候，觀衆們中間，曾起了一陣熱烈的反抗。他們所聽見的，都是一種嘎嘎不入耳的聲音。因此他們覺得這稱新東西太嘈雜了，使他們在影戲院中，失去了寗靜享樂的快樂。此外還有許多看不慣，聽不慣的地方，譬如他們所看慣的大明星康拉耐格爾，忽然在影片上面給給巴巴的說起話來了。幷且他說話的聲音、好像是從馬甲口袋裏發出來的。這使他們不期然而然的厭煩起來了。我們要知道在那聲片剛發明的時候，康拉耐格爾却是能說對百的寥寥幾個演員中之一。大家都你槍我奪的聘用他們，但是因為機械的不完備，却將他們的口音弄糟了。</p>
<p>最早的幾張有聲影片，大部份都是滑稽短片，其餘的亦有新聞片子。滑稽短片中的演員，大半都是戲台上雜要演員。但是不久之後，他們就在默片上，添加了對白的幕序。那種對白，可以使你從坐上驚跳起來的。許多你們以為很靜穆瀟灑的演員，忽然在銀幕上呌喊喧嘩起來了。幷且他們的聲音，並不是為了要抑揚頓挫，而却忽高忽低，使人聽得不耐煩起來。</p>
<p>許多守舊些的戲院經理，看了這種初期的有聲影片，都相信這種東西，不過一時的好尙，决不會持久的。他們都不肯化錢租用有聲片，但是他們看看自己戲院中人數寥寥，而對過的戲院裏的看客，却一天一天的增加起來。不人，他們就漸漸跟隨着別人，而採用起有聲影片來了。</p>
<p>至於好萊塢，那本來是是個感光最敏銳的地方，所以在聲片發明之後不到幾個月那裏已經起了一個極猛烈的擾動。好萊塢的物質觀念，已經完全變易了。喧嘩呼呌的默片攝影塲，已經拆卸了。偉大的，冷靜的，隔離聲音的有聲攝影塲，建築起來了。</p>
<p>我們要知道，默片的攝影場，是從來不「默」的，他們一班工作人員自從導演，燈光師，佈景師等等，都在不斷地高聲談話。但是到了聲片時代，他們却不能「聲」張了，因為一支針掉在地下，攝入影片之中，會和放槍一樣響的。</p>
<p>那時有一個音樂片極盛時代。好萊塢的鉅頭，將各處編歌曲的人才却搜羅了去，但是他們不久就覺音樂片做得太過份了，而許多編歌曲的，亦因之而失業回家了。但是在演員之中，那時却崛起了一個傑出的人才那亦是電影史上的羅曼斯，偶然發生的事。我們對於第一張有聲歌舞鉅製造「爵士歌者」（Thejazz　Singer，）大概還不至於健忘吧。當華納購買了那個腳本，預備作他們一鳴驚人之舉的時候，他們心目中的演員，本來是喬治傑索爾（George　Jessel）。但是當他們和喬治傑索爾商量訂立合同的時候，却因條件的不合而談判破裂了。華納公司於是就將那張合同，給與了一位紐約百老匯的歌星亞爾喬爾生（Aljoson）,一個舞臺沒落中的失意者。</p>
<p>在「爵士歌者」公映之後，亞爾喬爾生一躍而成了時世造成的英雄。他是當代第一紅人。他是有聲片前途惟一的希望。他引起了空前的轟動，也是此後少有的。他在某一種的立塲上，建立了特殊的功勳。那就是他給與了有聲電影的製作者，一個猛烈的興奮劑，並且使與有聲影片的發明，進步，和完成有關的一切人物，都得到了相當　慰藉與激勵。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c270">評「塊肉餘生」 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>David　Copperfield</p>
<p>——南京映</p>
<p>人們對於却爾期迭更斯（Charles　Dickens）的聲名，大概是早己震驚了，而且關於他的一切，也知道得很淸楚，所以在這裏假使再介紹一番，似乎沒有必要。退一步說，從「獄底餘生」或「孤兒流浪記」等影片中，觀衆們也早已深悉了他們的作風。因此關於「槐肉餘生」在影片上，我祇想從表現技術上說到些。</p>
<p>人們通常都都道，將一部數十萬字的小說，　着一萬餘尺的膠片表現出來，確是不容易的事。在容量上，顯然就是很困難的。因此，一般的文藝影片，都不能不將小說的不重要之處，　削一些，否則便祇有嚕囌而堆積。</p>
<p>另一方而，小說可以有精巧的心理描寫，這細膩的心理描畫，乃是戲劇，電影所不能做到的，而成為小說獨特的機能。因而當將小說改編電影的時候，就不能不極力將內心描寫　面的表現出來，然而這是非常吃力的工作。——這裏說明了電影有其獨特的技能，它是衝破戲劇的時間　空間的范疇，它得將一切抽象的字句具體的以畫面傳達，而使鑒賞者獲得更直接的感應。</p>
<p>在這些地方，「塊肉餘生」的作者，可以說是完全做到了的。這無論是在編劇，導演，表演，……各方面，都是十分優秀的，完全是電影藝術的地表現着的。為了說明這些，我想不妨略舉數例，作為具體的證實。</p>
<p>（一）幼年的大衛在漁夫家嬉遊，他偕一小女友在海濱，小女孩兒說：「假使我做了貴婦，我將給潘迪老伯（漁夫）買一件藍的大衣，在那衣上滿鑲着寳石。」從這對話裏，說明她是懷着遠大的奢望的。（這作為以後迷惑於少爺的伏綫）接上她在海岸的木板上，臨風高嘯，海鷗在她身邊翱翔，淡薄的白雲，隨着海波起伏飛飄，這對於她個性的烘托，眞是極好的表現</p>
<p>（二）大衛自潘迪處回家之後，開始度著凄苦的生活。當他因背書不出，受着繼父之毒打之前，導演以皮鞭和姑母之縫衣針的特寫，描寫大衛害怕的心理。及至我們看到他的被打，深深的為他同情而對那後父也深深的憎恨了。一直到他母親臨褥死去，那是凄風苦雨的薄暮，他從大聲喊叫着像囚徒一般逃下來，這使人們不能不為之感動。</p>
<p>（三）大衛徒步至姑母家，多次以計程不說明路程，同時從他的衣履上說明他的艱苦。至姑母家立刻寫出他姑母趕馬的癖性來，這和以前使麥可伯自窗口回家以避債，同樣的簡潔可愛。以後大衛向姑母述陳種種經過時，我們是為他酒着同情之淚了。</p>
<p>（四）再要說到的便是少年大衛偕友人至漁夫潘迪處，正當小柳密訂婚，這時大衛之友的唱歌，並不配以音樂，以顯出鄕間的樸質，也是獨特之處。再後來的狂風暴爾，巨浪淹沒小舟的一塲，使我們看到了極好的攝影技術了。</p>
<p>以上所述，都是比較特出特處，由此便説明「塊肉餘生」在表現方法上的成功。至於其本質的如何，却不在本文範圍之內了。</p>
<h3 id="c271">評「梨花海棠」 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Babbitt——國泰映</p>
<p>關於「梨花海棠」的檢討,首先不能不對原著者辛克萊劉易士（Sinclaite　Lewis）說到一些。人們不會忘記他是一九三〇年諾貝爾文學獎金（Noble　Prize）的獲得者，人們也不會忘記他是「大街」的作者。</p>
<p>凡是讀過他的作品的人，大概都理解他是一個諷刺作家。這無論是在「大街」中或「潘璧德」（Babbitt）中，他都以諷刺的筆觸，描繪了小鄕鎭的俗物們對於人間世的庸俗的見解，或者揭穿市儈們以及所謂上流社會紳士們的醜態或處世的庸俗。</p>
<p>說到這裏，使我們不能不聯想起同是以諷刺作家的姿態出現的　克倫敦或老作家特蘭漱（「妒花風雨」的原著者）。這兩位作家　够從經濟機構上去揭發社會的病態，而以諷刺的筆作為暴露給與讀者以深刻而辛辣的嘲笑的感應，另一方面對於現社會中被壓迫與被犧牲者，却給了極大的同情。因此在現實主義的觀點上，他們應當獲得極高的榮譽，至少在美國，，他們應當是成功的作家之代表者。</p>
<p>但是劉易士却是美國標準的布爾位家，他不會從本質上去諷刺或暴露，他祇是浮面諷　上流社會的人們不够道德，他以為萬貴的紳士們不應當陰奸狡詐。這些，在他是細膩，精緻的描繪他所看到的俗物，而正面的他是積極的作為現社會的支持者，有如忠忠　的僕人嘲笑了他們的主人的夜禮服，穿得不够體面一樣，也許，他們的主人，會因着這嘲笑的勸吿而衣冠齊整起來的。</p>
<p>現在我們來看這Bab　　　中他是怎樣寫着的？主人公潘壁德是十足的市儈，他有著庸俗的人生觀，他染著一切俗物所具備的劣行。而這種人，在上流社會中他是被輕視着，被玩弄着的，但是也親拖出上流　道德的卑污。這些，在電影的表現中，雖然經過若干刪削，可是我們還能看到他迷惑於女子的來信，他被擁為斑馬會的主幹者傳受寵若驚，他在創立圖書館的集議中，有着俗不可耐的見解，他結交權貴，顯耀於妻子之前，為了拍馬，他做着自己所不願做的事，——陰謀收買地皮以備他日　賣給政府獲得高價，其實他是一個庸俗的懦夫，一見女色便　露陰謀，及至受着女人的要脅又措乎不及，無法應付，幾乎要自殺，他看到到報紙對於自己的責難便又無以自容，幸而有一個幹練的妻，替他照料一切，結果給他掩飾醜惡，重新為人們所擁戴，於是他又樂不可支了。如此庸俗的市儈，在人們眼中，自然是可笑的人物了。但是這給與人們怎樣的印象呢？是否給人們明確的本質的認識為社會之羅惠呢？不，它祗是使人們笑笑而已。</p>
<p>上述的種種，在電影上由於劇本的結構緊凑，由於導演並不注意生硬的　頭，由於主演者Aline　MacMahon演技的優秀，這個戲並不是沒有成績的。可是作為喜劇的本片却不甚熱鬧，而且對話太多，也不免使人覺有些煩膩呢。</p>

<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>那女郞又笑著道：「你說是就是吧」。傑姆對她看了一眼，覺得這位社交女子太高傲了。他是她的上司，應當拿些上司的顏色出來。他於是鄭重其事的說道：「怎麽我說是就是　你或者是的或者不是，不能人家說你是就是呀。一那女郞道：「你說的有理。我就是恩愛斯……耐茜雪倫……但那並不是我的眞名名。傑姆故意聳起了他的眼眉，看了她說道：「王室？貴族？這樣隱名」？</p>
<p>雪倫知道他在調侃她，却毫不在意似的說道：一都不是的。我的眞名字是雪倫那各脫」，傑姆道：「那各脫？和紐博德的賽勒那各脫夫人有什麽關係」？雪倫道：「那就是我的母親。桀姆不覺吾了一聲，問她故新聞記者做了多少時候？雪倫説：「做了還不久。不過我知道這不是什麼難事」。傑姆自己點了一支雪茄，眼睛半張半閉的看着她，她那自負的態度，滿身的香味，還有那像童子的聲音，種種都使他覺得不安，他亦不喜歡那樣的女人。況且她那畫得血似紅唇，裁剪入時的衣着，都引起了他一種敵視的意思。</p>
<p>他想了一想，突然問道：「喜歡你的工作嗎」？雪倫道。「再好沒有了。有意想不到的興趣。當然，我不能限於音樂談評的一門。我什麼都得學習些。我想，一個現代的報紙，編輯的方法一定要改良一下，一定要用些眞正有知識的人」？</p>
<p>傑姆聽她講着，自己亦不開口。他拿起一張小樣來，假裝細細看着。但是雪倫還滔滔不絕的說道：「我覺得新聞記載報比較別的報，還稍為進步些，所以我就揀了這家報館，作為我實地練習之所。我想一個人無論他的理想怎樣充足，經騐却是不可缺少的……你說對不對？」她說着還嫣然地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>傑姆到了這個時候，心裏籌劃着怎樣處置這大言不慚的社交女子的方法。一回他微微咳了一聲，假作殷勤的說道：「我們叫兩客茶進來好不好」？她知道他在開她的玩笑，但却裝作不知似的道：「那再好沒有了」。她說了，就坐着等茶喝。傑姆徐徐將小樣一條一條地看着，打了兩次電話，亦不呌茶，亦不理她。雪倫呢，照舊的等候着，一些不氣餒。她靜等着他，她討論那篇音樂談評。她等了半天，看見傑姆除了將紙推來推去之外，沒有什麼重要的事，於是就自動開口道：「你見我，不是要討論那篇談評嗎」？</p>
<p>傑姆給她一問，然後抬起頭來道：「哦……不錯的。那篇文章太……太高妙了……太深刻了。當然，以你的程度，作起來是沒有什麼難處的，將那些老派的人，喜歡聽貝多芬的第五交響曲的一般人，譏嘲得體無完膚，但是……我的讀者却不不見得贊成你的議論」。雪倫臉上起了一陣紅雲，惡狠狠地看了他一眼，原來他叫了她來，尋她的開心的。他少年英俊的神氣，她是承認的，但他們第一次見面，就拿她不當東西的用她，使她不由得從心底裏憎惡起來。（未完）</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Wang Zuanxu's troops occupied Nanbu County on the 4th; the bandits retreated towards Laoya Rock and Huilongchang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xue Yue telegraphed on the 3rd, stating that the northern bandits were encircled and suppressed by our troops, and were fleeing eastward from Xifeng. Our Wu Detachment intercepted and suppressed them from Xiuwen. In the fierce fighting, Li Yunheng's army and Tang Yunshan's troops annihilated the Black God Temple's fake Second Division. They are now pursuing the bandits eastward and southeastward from Xifeng. The Zhou Detachment is crossing the river in hot pursuit with morale at an all-time high. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhu and Mao, seeing the large gathering of troops in Guiyang, knew it was difficult to proceed and retreated. They are now harassing Kaiyang via Zhayou and Xiuwen. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Hanhun arrived in the province from Guilin on the 5th, paid his respects to Chen Jitang for instructions, and then returned to Guilin. (Special dispatch on the 5th) The reinforcement troops from Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces are now entering Guizhou one after another. The Communist bandits fear being encircled and suppressed and are planning to break through the Xiuwen front to avoid encirclement. Another group of Red bandits is planning to break out of Xifeng, but has not succeeded. It is reported that they are retreating eastward. Since the Red bandits launched attacks on both fronts, the fighting has been quite fierce since the 2nd. Although the Communist bandits in Xifeng have already been defeated, the fighting in Xiuwen was still ongoing this morning at dawn. It is expected that the Communist bandits will also be defeated in this area. The fate of Guiyang can currently be relieved. According to the opinion of the military authorities, even if the Communist bandits break through the siege, the outer defenses of Guiyang are quite strict, and the Communist bandits will definitely not be able to penetrate deeply. After the arrival of the reinforcement troops, the situation has already taken a turn for the better. However, in order to plan for all contingencies, the authorities have advised all missionaries and foreigners to temporarily withdraw from Guiyang to Anshun. Guiyang has implemented martial law and adopted plans to ensure public safety and order. Pedestrians are strictly prohibited on the streets at night. It is reported that the Communist bandits attacking Xiuwen are led by the notorious bandit Peng Dehuai. According to the news received tonight, Guiyang is now out of danger. The fighting in Xifeng and other places has now ceased. The timely arrival of the Yunnan troops has greatly stabilized the position of the Central Army, and the situation has eased. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Xiao He's bandit gang entrenched near Tawo and Yongcheng are resisting stubbornly. After days of joint encirclement and suppression by Tao, Li, Zhang, Chen, Guo, Luo, and other departments, the bandits have suffered heavy losses and can be eliminated soon. The Thirty-Six Step Bridge position has been recovered by us. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th) The fake division commander Li Zongbao has led his troops to Gaoting Temple in Chen County, expressing his willingness to surrender, vowing to support the Kuomintang and be a vanguard in suppressing the Communists, and is responsible for recruiting and pacifying the remaining bandits in the border area of southern Hunan. He sent a telegram of commendation and dispatched Yang Yin to go and reorganize them. Zhu and Mao's bandits failed to flee south and changed their route, fleeing east to Wengan via Zijiang and Kaiyang. Our so-and-so department rushed to a certain place to intercept and suppress them. He convened a military expenditure reorganization meeting on the 10th. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

However, the province should submit the budget earlier in the future, and the expenditure of the business expenses should also be handled in accordance with the principles of the central government's decision on the financial revenue and expenditure system law. (4) The amendment to the Wuhan Municipal Public Bond Regulations and the Principal and Interest Repayment Schedule, resolved: Approved according to the results of the review by the Finance Committee.

Article 5: Factory inspectors shall be appointed from the following personnel: (1) Graduates of domestic and foreign industrial professional schools or above who have passed the training; (2) Those who have worked in factories for more than ten years, have considerable academic skills, and have passed the training; (3) Graduates of domestic and foreign industrial professional schools or above who have obtained a technician's certificate.

<p>(Nanjing) At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th to discuss the amendment to the Exchange Law, except for the clause that brokers or members shall not be entrusted by public officials to engage in buying and selling short transactions, the committee members debated a lot. The rest had no objections. Lu Fubingchang, Di Ying, Dai Xiujun, Zhang Zhihan, and others believed that public officials should not engage in speculative activities, which is a matter of rectifying official corruption, and should be ordered by the government as a special case. It does not seem appropriate to stipulate it in the Exchange Law, so as not to disrupt the legislative system. Moreover, public officials engaging in buying and selling short transactions will never reveal their real names and cast themselves into the legal net. The provisions of this article are almost meaningless and difficult to implement. Therefore, they firmly advocated deleting it. Shi Weihuan, Chen Changheng, Luo Yunyan, Lv Zhiyi, Chen Jianru, Zheng Hongnian, and others said that the provisions of this article are to accommodate the request of the trading industry. Due to the repeated tragic changes in the market, public officials often monopolize and manipulate it. With this clause, it can be strictly banned. As for public officials engaging in buying and selling short transactions, it is difficult to find out their real names. However, it is not impossible to find clues by studying the source of the capital guarantee money they pay. Therefore, they advocated maintaining the amendment. Then the chairman announced the vote, and only 17 people supported Fu's proposal. As a result, it was still passed according to the amendment. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan sent members Chen Jianru and Shi Weihuan to Shanghai to investigate the amendment to the Exchange Law.

<h3 id="e24">Hopes for the National Economic Construction Movement <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, our country's doors have been wide open. The great powers have successively invaded the Central Plains with political and economic force. As a result, our old economic structure has been insufficient to adapt to the times. If we take a century as a unit, China's economy has been oppressed and ravaged by external forces for a century. Today, not only are foreign troubles becoming more intense, but also natural disasters and man-made calamities occur one after another. The future of the national economy is truly enough to make people increasingly pessimistic. However, success or failure depends on human effort. Although today's phenomenon is pessimistic, if we can, in the midst of pessimism, display great determination, persevere with great perseverance, and implement with great plans, then who knows if today's pessimistic phenomenon will not be the foundation for future optimism. Recently, Generalissimo Chiang, in addition to his bandit suppression work, has traveled throughout the country and deeply felt that reviving the nation cannot be achieved solely by military force. Therefore, he initiated the National Economic Construction Movement as the foundation for national self-salvation. Therefore, this movement is extremely important. Whether speaking from the standpoint of the country or from the standpoint of the national economy, we should all sincerely wish it success.</p>
<p>However, the deeper the hope, the more profound the thought. There are several points that we humbly believe we must contribute to this movement. Please allow me to briefly discuss them. Over the past decade or so, many people in our country have talked about economic construction. Some focus on industry, some on agriculture, some take the facilities of foreign countries as a model, and some advocate adhering to our country's old habits. What they say is often biased towards one side. Therefore, their theories may not all be adopted as plans for constructing China's economy. Even taking the various construction plans established by past governments as examples, they may inevitably tend to emphasize one aspect while neglecting another. Therefore, at the time of planning, everything could be justified and supported. Once implemented, the defects that were not easily seen in theory may inevitably arise. Learning from past mistakes to prevent future ones, we sincerely hope that the entire country, from top to bottom, will pay attention to avoiding these past shortcomings in today's economic construction movement. To put it another way, if we want China's national economy to have new construction today, and at the same time want its construction to be effective, then its plan must be comprehensive rather than partial. Moreover, it must pay particular attention to the unique characteristics and weaknesses of the Chinese economy. Then, depending on the location of its weaknesses, and based on its inherent characteristics, thoroughly and evenly construct it without allowing for unbalanced development. Then, this type of construction can be the foundation for revival and achieve the effect of "once and for all."</p>
<p>Secondly, for China's economic construction today, we hope that not only will there be a comprehensive calculation in the plan, but also a distinction between urgency and priority in the implementation of the plan. For it is only by addressing what is urgent with urgency, what is slow with slowness, what comes first with priority, and what comes later with postponement, that what is achieved will be great, and all plans can maximize their effectiveness. It is human nature to often avoid the heavy and take the light. However, the construction of a country's economy must avoid falling into this malpractice. Otherwise, even if the plan is perfect, I am afraid it will not be easy to achieve grand and rich results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is another important issue in the National Economic Construction Movement, namely the cultivation of construction talents. In the past, many of our country's technical policies involved hiring foreigners for design or consultation. This phenomenon was indeed an unavoidable measure at the beginning of a country's construction. However, hiring foreigners is not only very costly, but also often creates many barriers due to different national conditions. Therefore, the policy of "using Chu talents in Jin" can be used for a time, but it is not a long-term solution. Therefore, in today's National Economic Construction Movement, we cannot help but hope that the government will also pay close attention to and make practical preparations for the cultivation of construction talents.</p>
<p>In short, under the current state of China's heavy pessimism, the National Economic Construction Movement is indeed an urgent necessity. If it is carried out properly, it can not only lift the people out of misery, but also improve our country's international status. May our countrymen rise up together and work for it.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Eden May Return to London Last Night, Cabinet Meeting Postponed, To Be Held Next Monday to Report on the Results of the Mission and Decide on the British Attitude in the Three-Power Conference <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(London) Eden returned to the country by plane from Prague last night. In the morning, he changed to a train to Wortham, and then planned to take a boat to Dover. He may return to the capital tonight. Eden's plane encountered a heavy snowstorm en route, and nothing could be seen on all sides. Fortunately, the pilot's skills were very refined, and he was able to land at Croydon Airport. Eden felt very uncomfortable after landing due to days of hard work, and immediately invited a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Although Eden heard that the weather between Croydon and London was extremely bad, he was eager to return to the capital. The doctor said that Eden had no other illnesses besides overwork and could recover his spirits after a night's rest. Eden seemed to have fully recovered when he went to Wortham. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Eden returned to London by plane from Prague yesterday afternoon. Due to bad weather en route, he landed and spent the night in Croydon. Today, he will probably change to a train or steamship to continue his journey. However, he will not be able to make it to the Cabinet meeting to report on everything. The cabinet members will discuss with each other at the end of the week, so that they can hold a meeting on the first day of next week, at which time it is expected that the British attitude to be taken at the Stresa Conference can be decided. The results of Eden's mission will be announced to the House of Commons on Monday, and then Simon and Eden will set off for Italy. Prime Minister MacDonald may accompany them. This can be decided on Monday. The talks between Eden and Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Beneš in Prague this time were very fruitful. According to the communique issued after the meeting, both sides agreed completely on the purpose of the British and Czech policies on maintaining peace, and expressed satisfaction with the two countries' loyal support for the League of Nations. The two sides talked for an hour, and Eden explained the points mentioned in the London Communique of February 3 in a very cordial manner, while Beneš explained in detail the Czech peace policy.

<p>European Conclusion Military Alliance (London) Europe will conclude a military alliance similar to that of the European War to promote peace. This is the opinion expressed here when Eden flew back to London today after visiting Eastern European countries. From the current situation, France, Soviet Russia, and Czechoslovakia seem to be concluding a powerful convention, with military mutual assistance to resist aggression. The purpose of the British plan is to avoid the military clauses in this convention and increase the responsibility of the League of Nations. Eden will formally report the results of the Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, and Paris meetings to Foreign Secretary Simon and Prime Minister MacDonald. French Foreign Minister Laval has reportedly discussed the mutual assistance convention with Soviet officials in detail, but Poland's disregard for this proposal has already been announced by General Pilsudski. Poland does not want to join any agreement that offends Soviet Russia or Germany. Officials believe that Germany and Poland both agree to conclude a ten-year armistice agreement, but the provisions cannot include military mutual assistance clauses. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Mussolini Plans to Go to the Countryside (Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini plans to stay in the countryside for a few days before the Stresa Conference. According to British newspaper reports, Mussolini will draft a concrete plan based on the 1934 Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement and submit it to the Stresa Conference. Then, there is no doubt that his stay in the countryside will be dedicated to drafting this plan. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Attitude of the Little Entente (Paris) News came from the British side yesterday that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will propose a plan at the Stresa Conference to expand the scope of the Rome Agreement concluded by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March last year and promote it to various countries. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš recently published an article in the "Figaro" newspaper, saying, "The economic cooperation methods of the Little Entente countries can be the first step towards international economic understanding. The Little Entente countries should regard the Rome Agreement as a supplementary document to the consultation agreement, and not as hostile competition. The economic cooperation between these two groups (referring to the Little Entente and the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian group) is extremely urgent and indispensable. Even the North and South European countries can also join, but this economic cooperation must also be concluded with agreements by Western European countries, especially Britain and France, in order to achieve its full effect." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>French Memorandum Submitted for Preliminary Discussion (Paris) Since Germany restored conscription on the 16th of last month, the French government has submitted a request to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, requesting it to handle the matter. The external supervisors are drafting a memorandum to explain everything because the Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 15th of this month. Regarding this matter, news came from the British side that the British government intends to submit this memorandum to the Stresa Conference for preliminary discussion, so that Britain, France, and Italy can reach an agreement. The French government believes that this memorandum should not hinder its possibility of holding negotiations with Germany, and therefore expressed its support for the method proposed by the British side. In addition, France and Russia are currently conducting negotiations. France proposed expanding the scope of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Convention on Saturday and Sunday last week, so that it can be promoted throughout Europe. France is also prepared to accept mutual assistance constraints from the Soviet Union, and other countries that are willing to join are also allowed to participate. The Soviet reply has recently been sent, and Foreign Minister Laval may publish it. As for Laval's trip to Eastern Europe, it has now been decided to go to the Soviet Union first, and then stay in Warsaw, Poland for a while on the way back, because the Soviet Union sent the invitation before Poland. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon Will Issue a Declaration (London) Labour Party leader Lansbury, the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, raised a question about the upcoming Stresa Conference. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he will issue a declaration next Tuesday, stating the prospects of the Stresa Conference. Churchill, the leader of the extreme Conservative Party and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, demanded that the situation of German armaments be put on the agenda for discussion. Prime Minister MacDonald agreed to hold a discussion on the day the parliament announces the recess, that is, April 18. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Italy's Attitude Stresses Prudence (Rome) An important person recently gave a speech explaining Italy's foreign policy, saying that Italy is very willing to accept the Eastern European Convention if it can include Poland and the Soviet Union. However, if Poland and the Soviet Union are isolated from each other, or even confront each other, Italy considers it very dangerous. Italy maintains a sympathetic attitude towards the Eastern European Convention, but it has to be prudent because Italy and the Eastern European countries have considerable relations. On the one hand, regarding the relationship with the Soviet Union, Italy was the first country to recognize the Soviet Union, so the relationship with the Soviet Union is naturally very good. Italy believes that if all parties can participate in the Eastern European Convention and bear certain constraints, its actual value will be completely in line with the plan proposed by Italy at the Stresa Conference. On the other hand, regarding the relationship with Poland, Italy's relationship with Poland is inevitably somewhat reserved, but it is still good. Although Poland's policy towards Germany is not liked by Italy, Italy has not caused strong resentment because of this. Piłsudski now disapproves of the Eastern European Convention. If other countries sign it on their own, regardless of Poland, Rome believes that it is equivalent to excluding Poland and forcing it to fall into the arms of Germany. Moreover, Poland should participate in the Danube Convention and be a guarantor of Austria's independence. Therefore, Italy believes that all security organizations cannot be established without Poland's support. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Austria Reorganizes Armaments Italy Opposes Britain and France Make No Statement Hungary and Bulgaria Request Based on Precedent <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Vienna) According to news from official circles today, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria will request at the Italian Stresa Conference to increase the military strength of each of these countries by one-fold. Therefore, the allied countries of Germany in the European War, whose armaments were once restricted by treaties, have now each sought to get rid of the shackles. If other countries do not allow it, at least one of them will disregard the treaty and implement it directly. Now Germany's reorganization of armaments has advanced rapidly, and Turkey has not yet complied with the restrictions of the treaty. Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg once said that he is willing to maintain friendly relations with Britain and France, so the Austrian government has not yet implemented its plan to reorganize armaments. The quota for the Austrian army is 30,000 people, and what is now being proposed is to increase it to 60,000 to 65,000 people, half of which should be conscripts. According to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, Austria shall not conscript soldiers, and its standing army shall be long-term service volunteers. As for the reported demands of Bulgaria and Hungary, observers say that this move has major diplomatic implications. They expect the Little Entente countries to also be involved, and therefore demand an increase in their military strength to protect themselves. In this way, Europe will once again become a heavily armed camp. It is reported that France will support Austria's restoration of armaments to a considerable extent, because the Austrian government is friendly to France and also strives to oppose the policies of the German Nazi Party. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will probably oppose this proposal. As for Britain, there is no statement yet. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After the Austrian cabinet decided to request the great powers for equality in armaments, it was learned from reliable sources today that Austria plans to set up a standing army of 12,000 people, 4,000 senior officers, 4,000 junior officers, and 35,000 conscripts, with a two-year military service, divided into two army corps, each army corps divided into four divisions. 4,000 officers of the National Guard, 7,000 soldiers, and other paramilitary organizations will all be incorporated into the ranks. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Austrian government's decision to request the restoration of the conscription system, the British government will state its position only after Austria submits a request to the League of Nations. Britain will consider the reasons given by Austria and refer to the opinions of the countries concerned in order to decide its attitude. (Havas, 4th) Austria is now planning to send a special envoy to participate in the British, French, and Italian three-power conference in Stresa to request the great powers to recognize its restoration of armaments. It is also heard that the German-Austrian alliance is also in progress. The diplomatic circles here are widely spreading this matter today. Although the Schuschnigg government is still friendly to France and Italy, well-informed sources believe that this has become the end of its rope, and public sentiment has turned to the German-speaking and German-blooded Germany, and it is quite thinking of restoring the old alliance relationship.

<p>(Paris) Belgium has devalued its franc, while France is determined to maintain the gold standard, causing very significant difficulties in trade between Belgium and France. French Minister of Commerce Marchandeau has already gone to Brussels early this morning to try to find a solution to this matter with the Belgian authorities. Belgian goods are now cheaper than French goods, and they are pouring into France, which will disrupt the French market. However, France is restricted by treaties and cannot increase taxes on Belgian goods, so it is quite difficult. It is probably going to implement exchange compensation or reduce the amount of Belgian goods entering France as a remedy. However, for political reasons, France is very unwilling to take these two paths. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of Commerce Marchandeau has set off for Brussels, the capital of Belgium, this morning to visit Belgian government officials to discuss the impact of Belgian currency devaluation and various issues related to French industry and commerce. Accompanying him are Panafieu de Fonbon, Director of the Trade Treaty Department of the Ministry of Commerce, and an inspector from the Ministry of Finance. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Capital of Belgium According to financial circles, the results that are expected to occur due to the Belgian currency devaluation have gradually become apparent in the past few days. Foreign countries have purchased Belgian public debt in large quantities, the amount of which exceeds the government's expectations. Because the purchase of Belgian securities is very strong, the National Bank has absorbed a large amount of cash and foreign currency, making its position even stronger. Various securities on the stock exchange continue to rise. However, various stocks whose prices have risen excessively after the Belgian currency devaluation have now seen a pullback. In short, various trends show that the hoarding of cash is now gradually decreasing. (Havas, 4th)</p>

According to the Associated Press, President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and other government authorities have repeatedly expressed this view to European political leaders. However, no one in Europe is willing to be responsible for convening it again, and the US government is also unwilling to initiate it, because the current situation in Europe has little direct impact on the United States. Economic experts believe that the final relief from the political and economic crisis in Europe must be achieved by re-negotiating commercial agreements and re-defining natural commercial zones.

<p>(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Walterhouse asked about the sudden death of two German women who took refuge in a house in London yesterday. One of the two women was Dr. Fabian, a German socialist and writer, and the other was Mrs. Weim, also a writer. It is now believed that they both died from poisoning. Walterhouse asked the authorities to find out the truth of the matter, because it was heard that the deaths of the two women were related to foreign political groups. Undersecretary of the Interior Croker-Hancock agreed to order the coroner to investigate thoroughly. It is heard that the two women had attempted to rescue Jacob, a journalist who was a member of the German Social Democratic Party, who was framed and taken into German territory from Switzerland. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Joeffrey, the leader of the Paris Law Society, today, the sudden death of the two German women who took refuge in London was definitely not due to suicide. German exiles in Paris are uneasy about the deaths of the two women and do not know where to turn to protect themselves. The two women had exposed the activities of Nazi Party members in London. Mrs. Weim was the widow of a state councilor who had served in the German Revolution of 1918. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

As for the British Army, it now lacks many important equipment. Since the signing of the Locarno Treaty, the military spending of various countries, except for Italy, which has decreased slightly this year, has only decreased by 16% in the United Kingdom. All other countries have greatly increased it. For example, Japan has increased by 90%, France has increased by 102%, and Russia has increased by 197%. I dare say that under such circumstances, the number of people who still do not recognize that the first duty of any government is to take appropriate measures to defend the country must be very few."

<p>(Berlin) German journalist Jacob died in Switzerland and was kidnapped by members of the German Nazi Party and taken to Germany. The Swiss government protested to the German government a few days ago, protesting that it had damaged Swiss sovereignty and demanding that Jacob be returned to the Swiss authorities. Diplomatic sources now believe that the German government will soon reply to the Swiss government's protest. The German government insists that Jacob was arrested in German territory and that it was a completely legal act. Therefore, there is no room for discussion on the matter of returning Jacob to the Swiss authorities. However, Germany accepts the use of arbitration procedures to resolve this dispute in accordance with the provisions of the German-Swiss Arbitration and Reconciliation Treaty of December 3, 1921.

(National Telegram, 5th) The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, is reportedly flying to Geneva at the end of this week. The Disarmament Conference has been in recess for a long time. Recently, the Committee on the Manufacture and Sale of Arms met in Geneva to draft a convention on the manufacture and sale of arms. Although there are still many differences of opinion internally, the drafting work will soon be a done deal. Therefore, Henderson specially came to Geneva before the extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations to contact all the experts and representatives who drafted the convention on the manufacture and sale of arms. When the Administrative Council meets, foreign ministers and representatives from various countries will come to Geneva.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of oil control in "Manchuria," the British Ambassador, Sir Clive, lodged a third protest on November 24th of last year. On March 25th, the Japanese side also submitted a memorandum through the British Embassy to the British government in response. On November 30th of last year, the American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, similarly transmitted a third protest from the American government. Therefore, Japan also intends to personally deliver a reply this week. The content of the reply is largely similar to the third reply to the British. The main points are as follows: 1. "Manchuria's" oil control policy is entirely initiated by "Manchuria's" independent sovereignty. Any third country is not allowed to interfere, including Britain and the United States. 2. Regarding the treaties China has with third countries, "Manchuria," having separated from China and become independent, does not have any newly signed treaties. It cannot be considered as unconditionally continuing to be bound by them. This is self-evident in international law. 3. "Manchuria's" oil control law has now reached the implementation stage within its borders. Therefore, American oil operators should be pragmatic and sincerely begin business negotiations with the "Manchurian" government authorities to seek the best solution. These are the main points of the reply. It is also reported that a similar memorandum will be delivered to the Dutch Minister to Japan, Mr. Pabst, next week, asking him to forward it to his government.

<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Ya</p>
<p>Discussions with Gansu Province Chairman Zhu on Opium Suppression and Cotton Planting</p>
<p>After the reporter returned to Lanzhou, the center of the country, he immediately visited Zhu Shaoliang, the Chairman of the Provincial Government. According to him, "Gansu Province's imports and exports have always been in deficit. Exports have been no more than 20 million yuan in recent years, while imports have been as high as 60 million yuan, a difference of more than 40 million yuan. The nation's foreign trade deficit has increased sharply, leading to the decline of the national economy. Gansu Province's deficit is so huge, which is naturally making it more impoverished. The province's main export goods are hides and furs, followed by medicinal materials and opium. (Opium leaves have insecticidal properties and are important for agriculture. In the past, they were sold well in the three northeastern provinces). The main imports are textiles, followed by iron, paper, and cultural supplies, Western medicine, gasoline, and machine oil, etc. In total, most of the imported goods are related to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. We are now hiring experts to research substitutes. With raw materials such as iron ore and wood, we can make paper and ironware. According to the soil and climate of each county, we are first promoting the planting of cotton, and secondly, the planting of sesame. The climate and soil of most of Gansu are suitable for cotton cultivation, but in reality, only a few counties plant cotton. Apart from Longnan, which is barely self-sufficient, the northeast mostly relies on Shaanxi cotton, and the west mostly relies on Xinjiang. Sesame is mostly scattered throughout the region, especially abundant in Longnan West Road. American rayon is originally made from this material. Gansu hemp fiber is of better quality and color than that produced in Jiangxi, only slightly inferior in length, so it can also be used to help solve the problem of clothing shortage. Other measures include developing the Yumen oil field, refining gasoline, and using residual oil to replace imported machine oil. We have entrusted the airline company to send samples to Germany for chemical testing, and there is a good possibility of success. The area occupied by opium planting is considerable. Once strict prohibition is implemented, in order to avoid the problem of low grain prices harming farmers if everyone switches to grain cultivation, we must select other crops, such as cotton, hemp, and indigo, to replace opium. We are now supervising the relevant agencies to actively research and experiment. Opium planting in twenty provinces has been repeatedly banned and relaxed, and the harm caused is beyond words. Five or six years ago, Gansu opium could still be sold to various ports in Zhili and Shanghai, which could slightly help the rural economy of the province. In recent years, the Tianjin market has been seized by Rehe opium, and the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are filled with Sichuan and Yunnan opium. The special tax of six jiao per tael transported to Shanghai and Hankou makes the cost too high, and it will be impossible to sell. In this way, Gansu goods will inevitably turn from exports to domestic sales. The position of adjusting the economy in the past has been completely swept away, and the great disaster of harming families and weakening the race is deepening with each passing day. Therefore, Gansu is determined to suppress opium, which is a major policy for the future. We are currently working with the central government to plan implementation methods. Once Gansu's military expenses can be fully paid by the central government, or if other appropriate methods are used to slightly alleviate Gansu's financial difficulties, then the prohibition of planting and smoking can be implemented immediately, and we can guarantee to achieve the great effect of complete prohibition within three years. Recently, we have been advocating and promoting the planting of cotton and hemp, and the authorities in each county have been informing opium farmers to first reduce the amount of smoking, and even extend to the addiction to foreign cigarettes, as well as advocating the use of local opium medicines. All of these can be taken as a prelude to determined opium suppression. As for development issues, we have always advocated that whether it is transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, mining, or education and culture, there must be detailed research and planning to ensure balanced development without any neglect. Gansu Province has great potential in mining, agriculture, and forestry, but due to local poverty, all the benefits are abandoned on the ground. If the financial and industrial circles are willing to invest in development, the local authorities and people will gladly welcome it." It is said that the cotton in Gansu Province in the past, the flowers and catkins of each plant are not inferior to Shaanxi cotton. Only the seeds are not good, the cultivation is not proper, and most farmers have no cotton-growing experience, and know little about the timing of cotton season, resulting in very few counties that plant cotton, and the results are very poor. According to a survey by the Department of Construction, there are only a few hundred mu to one or two thousand mu of cotton fields in 12 counties including Huixian, Zhenning, Tianshui, Chengxian, Gaotai, Dunhuang, Wudu, Wenxian, Jingyuan, Gaolan, Liangdang, and Wushan. The annual production of cotton lint is 70,388 dan, which is 261,496 dan short compared with the amount of cotton needed by the population of the province. At a price of 5 jiao per jin, the people of the province must spend more than 13 million yuan each year to purchase cotton from other places. If we can do our best to promote the cotton industry in the future, even if we do not have the extravagant hope of exporting, being able to be self-sufficient will already be a bright path for rural areas. According to artist Fan Youxi, "During the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, the opium ban in Gansu Province was very strict, and very few opium seedlings were planted. The price of opium was high, selling for eight or nine taels of silver per tael. Opium smokers who could not break their addiction went bankrupt. Many also quit automatically. Compared with the number of opium smokers before the ban, the decrease has reached more than 70%. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, there was an earthquake disaster, and in the tenth year, financial difficulties led to the unfortunate lifting of the ban and the second planting of opium. Because of the high value of opium, farmers flocked to it. During the ban, opium land was changed to cotton fields. At this point, cotton was abandoned and opium was planted again, resulting in a gradual drop in the price of opium and a daily increase in opium smokers. The number of opium smokers today has increased more than 20 times over the number who quit during the ninth year of the Republic. Many new members are young people, and it is customary to set up opium tools as an elegant gift for guests, which is the worst social habit. If this is not quickly corrected, I don't know where it will lead. If opium can be replaced with cotton, it is indeed a good intention and a good method. Taking my hometown of Jingyuan (Fan's county of origin) as an example, it was not originally a cotton-producing area, but during the opium ban, farmers competed to plant cotton. Wang Gongchen in Dongwan Town experimented with the new varieties of defuzzed cotton issued by the construction institute, and each plant was three or four feet tall and flowered about sixty or seventy times, with remarkable results. Other counties in the upper reaches of the Yellow River have similar climates and soils. If it is widely promoted, the effect should also be similar." Fan is good at calligraphy and painting, and in his old age, he pays attention to social education and always uses his spare time to create modern historical dramas for the Gansu and Shaanxi drama troupes. The reporter has visited the Qin Family Garden several times and has read the scripts he has written, which can inspire national consciousness. Now that I have heard these remarks, I am even more clear about the good measures for Gansu Province to suppress opium and promote the cotton industry. I eagerly hope that the authorities' determination will be put into practice as soon as possible, and I hope that financial experts and industrial experts in the southeast will quickly design investment to develop the rich resources of the northwest, so that the power of national capital and industry will establish a prior and deep foundation as early as possible. The impact will not only benefit the northwest region alone.</p>

<p>(Changshu) The rice industry strike has lasted for five days. Although some have eased and advocated resuming business first, the majority still insist on their decision. Losses have reached more than 200,000 yuan. Thousands of workers on Yitai Road have run out of food, almost causing a disaster. Fortunately, food was allocated to avert it. Now, the county has received a telegram from the Department of Finance ordering the withdrawal of Liu's committee to speed up the resolution. Liu has returned to the province. The county magistrate plans to go to persuade the opening of the market together with the Party Committee and the Chamber of Commerce on the 6th. This move seems to have a hopeful start. The continued expression of the various industries is still brewing. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Correspondence. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission was ordered to renovate the Jin Dike project, and drafted an emergency project plan to renovate the embankments in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, and determine the method of sharing the funds. Representatives of the three provincial governments and the heads of the river affairs bureaus were convened for a meeting on March 28. It was originally agreed that the Jin Dike section would require 460,000 yuan, all of which would be allocated by the central government and handled by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The emergency projects for the embankments in the three provinces totaled nine items, requiring 1.08 million yuan. It was decided that the central government would subsidize 540,000 yuan, and the remainder would be shared by the three provinces. It was recently heard that the Commission received 300,000 yuan in construction funds from the National Economic Commission yesterday (the 1st). The Commission believed that the various projects were very urgent, so it retained 100,000 yuan for the Jin Dike project and allocated the remaining 200,000 yuan to the other embankment projects, which was remitted to Shandong Province by the Central Bank on April 1st, 50,000 yuan to Hebei Province, and 50,000 yuan to Henan Province, and the provincial governments were telegraphed to quickly raise the funds for their responsibility, designate the responsible handling agency, and submit the project plan to the Commission for approval and transfer, and to start construction, and to telegraph the date of commencement and the handling situation. As for the Jin Dike renovation project, the Commission is actively preparing, and section engineering offices have been set up in Puyang, Hebei, and Fanxian, Shandong. The first section is from Huaxian to Gaodikou, the second section is from Gaodikou to Taochengbu.

That evening, the Vagrant Training Center, County Chamber of Commerce, Warehousing Association, Relief Institute, Property Management Office, and First District Office hosted a banquet in his honor at the First District Office. Lu Kansheng, director of the Property Management Office, delivered a welcoming speech. The event concluded around 9 PM. A total of 31 officers and 438 policemen from various counties were inspected. After the various subject exercises were completed, Director Yu gave a speech, briefly stating that the evaluation and inspection had made further progress. However, universal attention must be paid to spirit, discipline, reputation, knowledge, and conduct. The results of today's inspection will be announced in detail. The skills of Shanghai and Nanhui are better, but the water aspect is slightly worse and should be actively trained after returning. Land and water public security is most closely related to the public. Although there is some progress, it is still far from ideal and must be diligently trained from now on, especially in terms of spirit. If any former director is dismissed for lack of spirit and dereliction of duty, supervision and responsibility should be implemented level by level. After the inspection, everyone went to the county government for a public banquet. During the banquet, Mr. Yu spoke for about an hour. After the meal, they took the 1:44 train back to the province. Director Ye, who came with him, specialized in Baojia and went to the First District Office this morning to spot check the third phase of Baojia work, which was satisfactory.</p>

In early May, the Shanghai Verification Institute will re-verify the new dou used and notify the above counties separately, and report to the Ministry for record.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, took the night train from Nanjing at 11 PM the night before last and arrived at Zhenru at 7:15 AM yesterday morning. He went straight back to his private residence on West Aihams Road to rest and received Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, and Zheng Lai, director of the Customs Administration, for consultations. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to meet Fu Rulin and reporters from various newspapers to deliver the following speech.</p>
<p>National Economic Construction Movement According to Kong, Chairman Jiang has been traveling around the country in recent years, devoting himself to military suppression of bandits. Seeing the suffering of the people in various places and the bankruptcy of the rural areas, he realized the need for national economic construction. Therefore, following the New Life Movement, he advocated national economic construction to enable farmers to work hard in production, reduce consumption, and enable the rural areas to recover. This is the Principle of Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People advocated by Sun Yat-sen. To complete this movement, the government should work hard, and the people should also work hard to achieve success.</p>
<p>Relief for Domestic Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture Regarding the relief for domestic industry, commerce, and rural areas, it is in progress after the Ministry of Finance issued public bonds to replenish the capital of the three banks. Increasing the capital of the three banks is like adding an electric motor to a factory. With a motor, it can generate power and operate. After the three major banks have increased their capital, domestic industry, commerce, and rural areas can be rescued. The government is also seeking to urge the three banks to carry out relief work in a rational and scientific manner.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongquan Decides to Take Office Kong finally said that foreign media reports that he will convene a currency conference of various countries are incorrect. As for Zhang Gongquan's resignation as Vice President of the Central Bank, this is also not true. However, Zhang told him that he would take a short rest after completing the handover of matters at the Bank of China before taking office. Therefore, he has not yet taken office. As for the Ministry of Finance's exemption of transit tax and reduction of export tax, it is now planned to be implemented on June 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Decides to Use Boxer Indemnity Funds to Build a New River Steamer, Passing it Through the Board of Directors and Submitting it to the Ministry of Transportation <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company has finalized a plan, approved by the board of directors, to utilize the remaining funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to construct one Yangtze River steamer and two ships for the upper reaches of the Yangtze. Unexpectedly, due to the "Overall Alliance" agreement among Yangtze River shipping companies, changes arose concerning the ships. Therefore, the matter was reconsidered, and a decision has now been reached. The proposed ship design and related calculations are detailed below:</p>
<p>Revised Ship Design: The Yangtze River Seven Shipping Companies have agreed to a business revenue sharing system, eliminating mutual competition to pursue open cooperation. The draft proposal was prepared long ago, emphasizing larger and more economical vessels. Therefore, the ship dimensions determined in the second iteration of the China Merchants' Boxer Indemnity-funded river steamer project are unsuitable. Previously, Liu Hongsheng of the Shipbuilding Department, along with the Chief Ship Surveyor, and Wu Daming, were tasked with redesigning the dimensions for the new river steamer, with a deadline for submission to the General Manager's Office. This would allow for its presentation to the Board of Directors for bidding on construction. In recent days, Shen Jiyun, Wu Daming, and the New Ship Committee have finalized the drawings for the river steamer and submitted them to the Board of Directors for approval, forwarding it to the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>Tonnage and Dimensions: The third new plan involves constructing only one Yangtze River steamer, abandoning the plan for upper Yangtze ships. The tonnage of the new Yangtze River steamer will be increased. The finalized specifications are as follows: hull length (net) of 340 feet, vertical line length of 330 feet, width of 47 feet, depth of 15 feet and 3 inches, and a carrying capacity of 2,800 tons. The draft is classified into three categories: 14 feet carrying 2,800 tons of cargo; 13 feet carrying 2,450 tons; 11 feet 6 inches carrying 2,000 tons; and the shallowest draft of 10 feet 6 inches carrying 1,650 tons. This is the latest type of Yangtze River steamer, capable of operating even during the dry season without being forced to suspend service. The speed is 12 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<p>Ordering Materials: Due to the conditions attached to the Boxer Indemnity funds, the engine components and other materials for the river steamer will be purchased through bidding in the United Kingdom, with a budget of £33,000, equivalent to $429,000 in national currency. The hull, fittings, and cabin arrangements will be constructed at a Shanghai shipyard, with an estimated cost of $450,000. The anticipated shortfall of over $200,000 will be covered by the Bureau through other means. The Bureau has informed the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors of this intention, and once approval is received from the Ministry, the engine materials will be purchased in England.</p>
<p>Operating Budget: The Bureau has carefully estimated the operating budget for the new Yangtze River steamer. Assuming 33 voyages per year, each carrying cargo, the revenue from freight charges is estimated at $13,800 per voyage, and passenger fares are estimated at $3,500 per voyage. The total annual freight revenue is $455,400, and passenger fare revenue is $115,500, for a total of $570,900. The estimated expenses are: loading and unloading labor $39,600, dock fees $9,900, coal $79,860, materials $9,600, wages $52,000, interest $67,200, repairs $21,000, insurance $42,000, depreciation $42,000, and miscellaneous expenses $15,000, for a total of $378,160. After deducting expenses, the annual net profit is estimated at $192,740.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Allegations of Illegal Transfer of Chinese Eastern Railway Assets in Shanghai <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shishi News Agency reports that following the establishment of the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the issue of the disposal of the railway's wharf in Shanghai has drawn considerable attention. According to the Shishi News Agency's reporter, the representative of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), Sumida, along with the director of the Mantetsu Shanghai office, Ishii, have been in negotiations with the Chinese Eastern Railway Shanghai office regarding the transfer. The formal signing took place at 11:00 AM on the fourth at the Mantetsu office, with representatives Talsiff of the Chinese Eastern Railway Shanghai office, Sumida of Mantetsu, and Ishii present. In the afternoon, the three visited the Yangjiadu wharf to inspect and complete the handover procedures. It is reported that the Chinese Eastern Railway office at No. 33 Sichuan Road will be retained by Soviet Russia and renamed the Siberian Railway Shanghai Office.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 4th), the Japanese Rengo News Agency issued a statement saying that the Chinese Eastern Railway's assets in Shanghai were officially transferred to the management of the Shanghai branch of the South Manchuria Railway Company on Wednesday (the 3rd of this month) afternoon. It also claimed that the necessary documents were signed by the Russian and Japanese authorities. A reporter from the North China Daily News made inquiries, and Tahesis, the manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway's Commercial and Travel Bureau, replied that he had no comment. Ishii, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the South Manchuria Railway Company, stated that the branch had not received any of the Chinese Eastern Railway's assets in Shanghai, nor had it received any documents or books. He said that the transfer had not yet been scheduled and that whether the South Manchuria Railway's Shanghai branch would take over the Chinese Eastern Railway's assets in Shanghai would depend on whether the assets were profitable. He added that he was just beginning to investigate the matter. Mr. Xu Ershi, the lawyer representing the liquidator of the Banque Franco-Chinoise in the lawsuit against the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, stated that he could not comment. The matter is confusing and truly perplexing.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ample Rice Supply in Shanghai, Sufficient Until Autumn Harvest <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai rice merchants, previously concerned about the impact of imported rice on the sales of domestic rice, had requested the Ministry of Finance to increase the import tax on broken rice to maintain the market. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the rice shortage and to ensure market equilibrium, sometimes found it necessary to order imported rice. Therefore, it instructed the municipal government to order the Social Affairs Bureau to cease registration (of rice merchants). On the other hand, it planned to set tax rates in mid-June according to the grade requirements of rice. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the import of foreign rice, other than goods registered before, has now been completely stopped. There is a large inventory in Shanghai, and the quality of domestic rice is excellent. It is therefore anticipated that the supply can be maintained until the autumn harvest. The market prices in recent days have also been quite stable.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Japanese Merchant Plans to Promote Kerosene Sales and Seeks to Promote Matches <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to the 5th's Mainichi Shimbun, in addition to establishing a branch in Fukuoka Prefecture, the Japanese Kerosene Joint-Stock Company's agency is seeking to promote sales in Shanghai. Recently, samples were sent to Shanghai, and due to the favorable situation, it was decided to open a branch in Shanghai. The management office has already been located at No. 125, Enterprise Building, 33 Sichuan Road. A large shipment of goods is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month at the latest. According to Mr. Harada, Japanese kerosene has been well-received by Chinese merchants recently, but the quantity is very small. In the future, efforts will be made to conduct research and studies to expand sales, and there are also plans for machine oil, gasoline, etc.</p>
<p>It is also reported that since the impact of anti-Japanese sentiment, the import of Japanese matches has been completely blocked. Recently, with the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, the presidents of various companies such as the Kobe-based Daido Match, Toyo Trading, and Asahi Match, including Mr. Ryuukawa Gisaku, known as the "Match King" of Japan, will come to Shanghai shortly to plan methods for promoting Japanese matches in China. If Japanese matches can be sold in China, it will cause a major blow to Chinese merchants and Swedish merchants. However, Chinese match manufacturing has already become very developed, and the import of foreign goods is likely to be small. Moreover, Swedish matches are now affected by Chinese domestic products. Therefore, whether Ryuukawa's visit to Shanghai for negotiations will be effective is still uncertain.</p>

<p>Various circles in Shanghai are preparing to erect a bronze statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled for the 14th of this month to organize a preparatory committee. However, due to the influx of letters from various circles requesting to join the initiation, and the incomplete completion of various procedures, the meeting cannot be held as scheduled and must be postponed for some time to facilitate the participation of various circles. The date of the meeting will be announced separately by the preparatory office at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Art Exhibition Preview: Reception for Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries Tomorrow; Antiquities from Academia Sinica Arrive; Minister of Education Wang Shijie Arrives in Shanghai; Opening Ceremony Approved for the Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai preview exhibition for the London Exhibition of Chinese Art, which has been in preparation for many days, will open the day after tomorrow (the 8th). In recent days, many parties have come to Shanghai to prepare for participating in the opening ceremony and viewing the antiques. Minister of Education Wang Shijie, who is in charge of the exhibition, arrived in Shanghai yesterday to provide on-site guidance for everything. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed the person in charge of the exhibition yesterday, who stated:</p>
<p>Exhibits Added: All antiquities, except those sent by Academia Sinica for the exhibition, have already been properly displayed. The antiquities from the Academia Sinica only arrived at the exhibition hall the day before yesterday. They are all rare items of archaeological interest, totaling one hundred pieces, such as ancient weapons such as spears, which are rarely seen by modern people. They have now been displayed one by one for public viewing. The exhibition hall has also added "Archaeological Selections" to the list of exhibits announced in the preliminary advertisements, in addition to the original paintings, calligraphy, embroidery, bronzes, porcelain, ancient books, jade articles, folding fans, cloisonné, and carved lacquer.</p>
<p>Compilation of Catalogues Available for Sale: A total of approximately one thousand antiquities are on display. To facilitate understanding of the antiquities for the general public, the exhibition hall has specially compiled Chinese and English catalogues, providing detailed explanations. The Chinese catalogue is being printed by the Commercial Press, using Song typeface and Chinese paper, totaling approximately two hundred pages. It is antique and beautiful. It will be sold at cost during the opening, at approximately four or five jiao (cents).</p>
<p>Invitations for Viewing Issued: Wang Shijie, the chairman of the Preparatory Committee and Minister of Education, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He plans to invite President Wang (Zhaoming) and other government officials in the morning of the 7th, and international dignitaries and newspaper reporters in the afternoon to visit the exhibition. Invitations have already been issued.</p>
<p>Tickets for Admission Entrusted for Sale: To maintain order at the entrance, the exhibition hall has decided not to set up ticket booths at the entrance, and has entrusted the Bank of China on Hankou Road, the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, the China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road, and the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road to sell tickets.</p>
<p>Wang Shijie Issues Statement Yesterday: Minister of Education Wang Shijie arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last, arriving at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him at his residence. According to him, in addition to attending the opening ceremony of the Shanghai preview exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art, he also plans to attend the preparatory committee of the National Games to be held in Shanghai this year. Regarding the Shanghai preview exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art, he has not yet visited the exhibition and lacks research in art, so he has no comment. However, all the experts have put in a lot of effort in selecting the antiquities. The five British committee members specially dispatched to China to select antiquities also have special opinions, which were adopted here. It is inevitable that the exhibited antiquities will represent the art of our country. Moreover, because they are arranged in an orderly manner, they can arouse interest among viewers with artistic appreciation abilities. For example, porcelains from various kilns from the Song dynasty to the Qing dynasty, and ancient paintings from the Tang dynasty to the Qing dynasty, are systematically introduced. A long article will be released soon by the preview exhibition to provide a detailed report and explanation to the people. As for the National Games, there was a resolution to hold them every two years, rotating between the capital and various provinces and cities. This year's games will be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Day. The preparatory committee has decided to hold a meeting at the municipal government on the 8th of this month, but the specific plan will depend on the standing committee. When the Central News Agency asked about the Ministry of Education's recent plans, Minister Wang replied that the Ministry is currently striving to promote compulsory elementary education. Whether it can be realized depends on whether the government has a solution for the funds required for this plan.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Request to Negotiate with the United States to Increase Egg Taxes; Minister to the United States has already negotiated with the U.S. State Department <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, previously based on a letter from the Egg Industry Association, stated that since Chinese eggs have been subject to heavy taxes by the United States, the export of fresh eggs to the United States has been cut off for many years. Only a small number of dried eggs and egg products have been shipped in recent times. Unexpectedly, the U.S. Congress has recently proposed to increase the sales tax on eggs. The severity of the tax rate is unprecedented. The selling price of dried egg white is approximately US$0.50 per pound, with the original tax being US$0.27. Now it needs to be increased by another US$0.31, making the total tax US$0.58, taxing over 100% of the value of the goods. The selling price of dried egg yolk is approximately US$0.14 per pound, with the original tax being US$0.27. Now it needs to be increased by another US$0.31, making the total tax US$0.58, taxing over 400% of the value of the goods. The selling price of frozen wet eggs is approximately US$0.11 per pound, with the original tax being US$0.11. Now it needs to be increased by another US$0.15, making the total tax US$0.26, which is approximately 200% of the value of the goods. This heavy tax by the United States will completely prohibit the import of Chinese eggs. Please forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urgently telegram Minister Shi in the United States to protest and withdraw this unreasonable proposal. The Association sent a telegram to both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on the 26th of last month and received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The original text is recorded below: "Your telegram is noted. The Ministry has previously telegraphed Minister to the United States, stating that negotiations have been made with the U.S. State Department. Later, a telegram was sent urging a thorough negotiation. Now, according to your telegram, a reply is hereby issued for your information. This approval."</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Cotton Merchants of Three Provinces Continue to Petition for Increased Taxes on Foreign Cotton <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yuwen, Geng Zijing, Yang Yizhai, Guo Lizhai, Jie Qingxuan, Mao Tingfang, Sun Ruitang, Xiong Zhifu, Yi Qing, Guo Pinsan, Cao Shaoling, Gao Ziming, Yang Ruitian, Zhang Jifu, Wang Ziming, Li Libo, Wang Zizhong, and other representatives of cotton merchants from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces submitted a document to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Legislative Yuan, and the Cotton Control Committee on March 31st, stating (abbreviated titles):</p>
<p>We respectfully submit this petition concerning the unbearable pressure from foreign cotton, humbly requesting increased taxes to curb it. Merchants and the public alike observe the current situation where foreign cotton floods the market, is recklessly dumped, and Chinese cotton sales are entirely usurped, causing enormous losses and a dire situation urgently requiring relief. We preemptively telegraphed a major portion of this matter to your departments on the 23rd of this month, requesting that increased taxes be imposed to curb it.</p>
<p>It is our understanding that the purpose of tariffs is to regulate the import of foreign goods and to protect the sale of domestic products, and especially to prevent foreign goods from undercutting and suppressing domestic products, which is its primary objective. In the past, our national tariffs were constrained by foreign powers, lacking the freedom to increase them, and merely served as a source of national revenue. Its original purpose was almost entirely lost. Moreover, the tax rates were lower than those of any other country, which allowed foreign merchants to bring in their surplus products in vast quantities, like water flowing downhill, surging and sweeping away our hard-earned money by the tens and hundreds of millions. The decline of our national power and the exhaustion of our people's strength are mainly due to this.</p>
<p>Our National Government, recognizing this, strives to fight and resolutely declares tariff autonomy. Decades of restraint are lifted at once, and all people rejoice and congratulate each other. However, given that autonomy is just beginning, some reservations are unavoidable, and a gradual increase method is adopted to show prudence. Therefore, the fundamental purpose of tariffs to curb the undercutting of foreign goods has not yet been fully realized. This matter concerns the national economy, and merchants and the public dare not add frivolous opinions. However, foreign merchants have superior financial resources and their ambition toward our vast market is growing. The previous tax increases were minimal and only slightly restrained them, while our merchants and the public, suffering from years of floods and droughts, barely surviving, are still unable to compete.</p>
<p>Taking the cotton industry as an example, there are no fewer than a thousand cotton merchants in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Shanghai, and other places, with businesses worth tens of millions. However, they are all scattered in their operations, with only enough capital to purchase goods and not enough to cover transportation costs, let alone the financial resources to stockpile and wait for sales. Therefore, every time goods are transported to a place, they must immediately borrow from banks to ensure turnover and then seek sales. As for foreign cotton merchants, they are all large corporations with deep roots. Economic aggression has long been their way of doing things. Our country's foreign cotton tax rate has always been low, making imports very convenient and sales very easy. Over the years, their accumulated power has become extremely strong, allowing them to toy with our merchants at will.</p>
<p>Therefore, at times, foreign cotton floods the market, creating a monopolistic image. When Chinese cotton comes on the market, they recklessly dump and do everything possible to suppress it, preventing people from buying Chinese cotton and making it impossible to sell. Cotton merchants are unable to repay their bank loans and are eventually forced to sell at low prices, with the proceeds used to repay the loans, often leaving them short. Cotton merchants are defeated, which inevitably affects farmers. The annual losses are incalculable, and the cumulative effect has led to the fragile situation of cotton merchants today. It is painful to talk about.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that foreign cotton exploits our country's low tariffs to manipulate prices at any time, employing its toxic strategy of undercutting and suppressing Chinese cotton. The way to save the industry is to address the symptoms and prescribe the right medicine, striking at the root of the problem, and increasing the foreign cotton tax heavily. Unless this is done, all other efforts will be in vain. Because if the tax is heavy, the quantity imported will inevitably decrease, and their toxic plan of undercutting will also be limited by the increased cost, preventing them from implementing it fully. Our dying cotton industry's hope for recovery lies in this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are an agricultural country, and cotton is a major agricultural product, with the Northwest being its production area. In recent years, the National Government has been developing the Northwest and striving to improve cotton quality and increase production. Farmers are then compared to improvements in quality and increased production. Farmers then compared to each other. They managed to improve their operations more and more each day with greatly increased production. It is estimated that it already meets our national needs. We can no longer purchase foreign cotton and plug this hole. Compared to the past, we should have been rejoicing. How could we know that, despite our efforts to transport and sell, we cannot escape the undercutting and suppression of foreign cotton, either becoming stagnant and unable to sell, or being forced to suffer unbearable losses, ultimately causing those of our people who are trying their best to retreat in defeat? The reason the National Government is developing the Northwest, taking cotton as an example, is that while it intends to love us, it is actually harming us. This is certainly not the original intention of our government to benefit the country and the people.</p>
<p>Merchants and others are suffering losses now, and the situation is critical. We humbly beg your department to understand the situation, overcome all difficulties, and immediately increase the import tax rate on foreign cotton. We also request you to grant and implement this measure to provide relief and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. We urgently submit this petition, hoping that you will consider it.</p>

<h3 id="e146">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Maritime Vessel Runs Aground Outside Zhenhai; Fully Loaded with Saigon Rice; Awaiting High Tide for Rescue <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's leased merchant vessel Maritime, weighing 3,000 tons, previously sailed to Lao Yao and recently changed its course to Annam to load Saigon rice for unloading in Ningbo. On the 4th of this month, the vessel, fully loaded with rice, sailed to the sea off Hudun Mountain outside Zhenhai, more than ten nautical miles from Zhenhai. Due to mistakenly navigating the wrong channel, it ran aground on the shallows near Hudun Mountain. At the time, the captain measured the water depth, which was less than sixteen feet, while the Maritime vessel had a draft of more than twenty feet. With the heavy load, the hull sank five feet deep into the sand. After running aground, the captain tried to speed up the engine to escape, but the bottom of the vessel was deeply embedded in the sand, making it impossible to move. He had no choice but to telegraph the Shanghai headquarters yesterday morning. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters notified the shipowners of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and had the chief shipowner telegraphed the Xinjiangtian vessel of Ningbo, requesting it to pay attention when passing through the waters off Hudun Mountain to avoid running aground. The Maritime vessel is currently awaiting high tide. If it can escape danger, that would be best; otherwise, a tugboat will need to be dispatched for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Case of Seaman Tong Tianhou, Who Died on the Xianghe Vessel, is Resolved; The Company Accepts Three Conditions; Compensation Has Been Fully Received by the Family <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Western officer Niu Men of the Longhe vessel, who forced and beat seaman Tong Tianhou of the Xianghe vessel, causing him to fall into the water and die, the Chinese Seamen's Union sent secretaries Zhao Banfu and Sun Lyping to handle the negotiations for this case. The company has now accepted the conditions proposed, including punishment, apology, and compensation. The compensation of 1,200 yuan was received from the company by a representative of the union yesterday. The money was then fully received by the family of Tong, who went to the union. The swift and satisfactory resolution of this case is truly what the seamen hoped for.</p>

<p>Rex, the captain of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haixiang vessel, caused an accident while serving on the Puan vessel, damaging a British vessel and a sailboat, causing losses of over 100,000 yuan. The General Association of Captains telegraphed the department to revoke his certificate. The Marine Insurance Association also sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, denying his qualification as a captain. The department also instructed Liu Hongsheng to thoroughly investigate the accusations against Rex to determine whether they were accurate. Liu handed the matter over to the Board of Supervisors for review. The Board of Supervisors has now confirmed that the allegations against Rex regarding the accident on the Puan were true. General Manager Liu has submitted a response to the department, awaiting departmental orders to revoke his certificate or dismiss him from his position.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Concerns Itself with the People's Food in Their Hometown; 50,000 Shi of Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice to be Distributed to Counties in Old Ningbo Prefecture <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Due to the drought in Zhejiang Province last year, all counties in Ningbo Prefecture were affected by the disaster. Reports of crop failures were received from various places. During the transition from spring to winter, farmers already suffered from a shortage of food. As they prepared for spring plowing in this transitional period, the difficult situation in the countryside was even more unimaginable. After repeated discussions among the executive and supervisory committee members, it was decided to request a tax-exempt passport from the Ministry of Finance to purchase 50,000 shi of foreign rice for distribution to the counties for disaster relief or price stabilization. The tax-exempt passport has now been received, and the purchase and distribution of rice are planned soon. The letter sent to the disaster relief sub-committees of the county governments is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Greetings. Last year's drought in Zhejiang Province severely affected all counties in Ningbo Prefecture. However, the provincial government's investigation of the disaster and handling of winter and spring relief efforts did not include the counties, leaving the disaster victims in Ningbo Prefecture feeling left out. The members of our association, due to our hometown ties, could not bear to stand idly by. Therefore, amid the impossibility of finding other methods, we separately planned a relief method. We sent a letter to the Shanghai Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, which forwarded it to the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, requesting a tax-exempt passport from the Ministry of Finance to purchase 50,000 shi of foreign rice. We have now received it. This tax-exempt foreign rice is Western Rice No. 2. Because it is exempt from import tax, the price per shi can be reduced by several yuan compared to the current market price. We plan to distribute the entire 50,000 shi to the counties of Ningbo Prefecture, so that each county can prepare funds to transport and distribute it separately for disaster relief or price stabilization, hoping that the disaster victims can benefit somewhat. The amount of rice allocated to your county is approximately so many shi. We would like your government's disaster relief sub-committee to quickly raise the funds and send representatives to Shanghai to contact and transport the rice. This matter concerns disaster relief, so we hope you will investigate and expedite the process and reply accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Lawyers Association Issued Three Notices to All Members Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued notices to all members yesterday, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Calling for a General Meeting to Re-elect Staff. We respectfully inform you that the Spring General Meeting of Members will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th of this month (Sunday) at the Hushi Club, located at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. The meeting will report on association affairs and re-elect staff. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we are sending this letter accordingly. We hope that your esteemed members will take note and attend the meeting on time to deliberate. Furthermore, all members who have not paid their regular fees for more than four months and have not paid after being urged by letter are required to pay their outstanding fees by the 14th of this month. After the deadline, we will report their withdrawal from the association in order to calculate the statutory number of attendees for the meeting. This is a combined notice. We wish you peace.</p>
<p>(2) "The Ministry of Law Approves the Committee System." We respectfully inform you that this association previously received an order from the Shanghai Local Court, forwarded from Order No. 3517 of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, based on a request from the China Rule of Law Society. The request stated that the Shanghai Lawyers Association uses a committee system, which is inconsistent with Article 26 of the Lawyers Regulations, and requested that we comply with the regulations. The Shanghai Lawyers Association was previously granted permission to implement the committee system due to special circumstances. Since it was a temporary expedient, it should still follow Article 26 of the Lawyers Regulations and be amended accordingly. After receiving this order, this association convened a series of general meetings of members to discuss the association's rules. However, the meetings were adjourned due to insufficient attendance. Later, based on a proposal from members Wu Guochang and 21 others, it was noted that since this association was granted permission to implement the committee system eight years ago, its work efficiency has actually been higher and its affairs have progressed more smoothly than during the chairman system. In terms of re-electing staff each term, there are fewer adjournments. In contrast, associations using the chairman system often adjourn re-elections repeatedly, even convening them for several years without successful re-elections. The large size of this association is unmatched by other associations, and the special circumstances justifying the use of the committee system still exist. Since receiving the order to amend the association's rules, seven meetings have been held without any success. The sentiment of the people can be gauged. Please forward the proposal of over 170 members to maintain the temporary association's rules regarding the provisions of the committee system to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for consideration. This was approved by the 191st joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association and forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instruction. Later, we received Approval No. 841 from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which stated, "The report and proposal are noted. Since Shanghai has special circumstances, the committee system may be temporarily used before the Lawyers Law is formulated. A copy is kept on file." This was approved by the 193rd joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association and should be forwarded to all members for their information and record. We are sending this letter accordingly. We hope you will take note.</p>
<p>(3) "Change in the Authority of Land Agents." We respectfully inform you that, based on a previous letter from member Hu Fenglian requesting a transfer of the letter to the Municipal Land Bureau to change the procedures for land sales and transfers and mortgage registrations, this association sent a letter to the Municipal Land Bureau requesting a change in procedures. If the individual cannot be present, their legal representative may be present to carry out the land sales and transfer and mortgage registration. Later, we received a reply from the Director of the Municipal Land Bureau, stating, "The Land Certificate Transfer and Registration Procedures and the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules approved for implementation in this city do not have provisions for agents. However, Article 68 of the Shanghai Land Law stipulates that when an agent applies for registration, an authorization letter should be attached. In the future, cases may be handled accordingly." This was approved by the 193rd joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association and should be forwarded to all members for their information and record. We are sending the attached reply letters accordingly (omitted). We hope you will take note and act accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Employee of the Mardy Company Sues for Theft After Car is Recovered <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Ma Shiqi, residing at No. 1 Yuansheng Lane, No. 93 Pisani Road, French Concession, previously purchased a car from the Mardy Motor Company at No. 80 Avenue Edward VII, numbered 6886, priced at 4,700 taels. It was agreed that payments would be made in installments. If payments were overdue, the car would be repossessed. A contract was signed as evidence. Because Ma was overdue for three installments, totaling over 600 yuan, the foreman of the company ordered employees Feng Xiangsheng (37 years old, from Jiading, residing at No. 436 Rue du Pere Robert), Shu Shangli (27 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 2 Shenderi Lane, Daxi Road), Shi Wenyuan (14 years old, from Jiaxing, residing at No. 13 of a certain lane on Jing'an Temple Road), and Ling Renjie (24 years old, residing at an unknown address) to go to Ma's residence in Yuansheng Lane and tow the car back to the dealership. However, Ma's chauffeur, Meng Suilong, noticed them and apprehended and detained them, accusing them of theft. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court and charged with theft under Article 338 of the Criminal Code. After questioning, each was released on bail pending further investigation. Yesterday, they were summoned again. According to the plaintiff, Ma Shiqi, the defendants did not commit theft. They were employees of the Mardy Motor Company and it was a misunderstanding. He requested that they not be prosecuted. During the questioning, Li Xiangsheng and the others confessed that they were indeed ordered by the foreman of the company to recover the car and were not stealing. Attorney Olsen, representing the defendants, argued that the defendants were instructed by the foreman of the Mardy Motor Company to retrieve the car and were in a passive position. The charge of theft brought by the police is unfounded. The plaintiff also does not wish to prosecute because the police suspect that there are other issues involved, which is why the case was submitted. Even if there was negligence, the company should be held responsible. The defendants did not commit any crime and should be acquitted. Judge Sun Penghuan agreed and declared the debate closed. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th. The defendants remain on their original bail.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Institute of Electrical Engineers Inaugural Annual Meeting Opening - Morning Annual Meeting Opening - Afternoon Business Meeting <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The first annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers was held at 9:30 yesterday morning in the Industrial Hall of Jiaotong University. Attendees included more than sixty members such as Zhuang Zhongwen, Hu Duanxing, Shou Junliang, Liu Qishu, Hu Ruixiang, Zhang Chengyou, Zhou Yukun, Bao Keyong, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Huikang, Li Faduan, Liu Jinyu, Li [blank], Yuan Weiyu, Zhang Tingjin, and Wu Jinqing.</p>
<p>President Li Ximou chaired, with Zhao Huijue, Secretary of the Assembly, taking minutes. The chairman delivered an opening address, stating briefly that holding the first annual meeting of the association at Jiaotong University, the source of electrical engineering academic thought in our country, was most appropriate. This annual meeting marks a new era for the electrical engineering field of our Chinese nation. It is the first time in the history of our country that so many electrical engineering experts have gathered together, which is of great commemorative value. The development of industry and commerce in European and American countries is centered on electrical construction. The responsibility and mission of electrical engineers are self-evident. We should not shy away from difficulties, strive to advance, and hope that all sectors of society will provide spiritual and material assistance. Then, the electrical engineering cause in our country will be fortunate. Next, Director Zhuang Zhongwen reported on the preparations. Subsequently,</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Longzhang, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating briefly that the Party Headquarters has been sparing no effort in promoting academic organizations. You are electrical engineering experts with real knowledge, and I admire you very much. However, you are in an unfortunate environment because of the lack of electrical engineering research equipment in the country. We rely on your hard work and struggle to overcome the environment and bring a different color to the electrical engineering of our country. This is what I sincerely wish for. Next, Chief Secretary Yan Renguang, representing Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications,</p>
<p>offered words of encouragement, stating briefly that Minister Zhu was unable to attend due to illness, so he was sent to represent him at this grand event. He had just heard President Li report on the organization of the Electrical Engineering Society, which was initiated abroad. He remembered that the Science Society was also initiated abroad twenty-one years ago, and now has more than 800 members. Extrapolating from this, the development of the Electrical Engineering Society in twenty years will be immeasurable. In the past, scholars pursued their own interests and did not know how to unite, resulting in a lack of concrete plans and overall advancement of the cause. The purpose of the Society is to unite and study major domestic engineering problems, learn from each other, and seek the greatest gains. It is hoped that all members can openly discuss their research findings and that the annual meeting will be a complete success.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's representative, Xu Peihuang, offered words of encouragement. Mr. Xu is the current president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. The first annual meeting of the Institute is being held at Jiaotong University, the source of electrical engineering academic thought in China, which is not only an honor for Jiaotong University but also for our city. Shanghai is the most developed area of industry and commerce in our country and uses a lot of electricity. It is hoped that the Electrical Engineering Society will study the electrical problems in Shanghai in addition to the meeting. The annual meeting agenda includes visits to various factories. It is hoped that you will be able to conduct a detailed inspection and comparison of the state-run and foreign-run factories and provide criticism for reference. We also hope that members of the Electrical Engineering Society can establish more electrical machinery manufacturing plants so that you can not only research but also lead by example and achieve practical spirit, which would be fortunate for the people. Mr. Xu also represented the Chinese</p>
<p>Institute of Engineers in hoping for close cooperation between the two societies, briefly stating that he was delighted to be able to attend the grand annual meeting. The establishment of the Electrical Engineering Society must be due to its need in the profession. We must know that the more advanced the academics, the more specialized the fields become. We anticipate that the Electrical Engineering Society will also be divided into strong electricity, weak electricity, and other organizations in the future. However, the main point is cooperation. The so-called [blank] then [blank], [blank] then [blank], should be the guideline for our engineering community. Song said that engineers must be able to cope with the environment and have great personality and courage. If engineers have this achievement, they will succeed. Subsequently, Jiaotong University</p>
<p>President Li Shengsheng offered words of encouragement, stating briefly that it was an unparalleled honor for the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers to hold its annual meeting at Jiaotong University, and he expressed a twelve-point welcome. Any organization must be able to help oneself and others. Educational and academic institutions should achieve this level. The chairman just explained that our school pioneered the Department of Electrical Engineering in China. Although the founding time was not early, fortunately, former President Tang of our school was able to overcome difficulties and catch up. Today, graduates of our school are serving in the electrical engineering field in China, which may not be the result of the founders' century of cultivation. Recalling the beginning of the founding of the Department of Electrical Engineering by former President Tang Weizhi, the original budget was 3,000 yuan, but the government only allocated 500 yuan. Former President Tang did not fear the lack of funds, but started with these 500 yuan, overcame difficulties, had a unique vision, and achieved today's results. Otherwise, people are all indebted to Mr. Tang. However, regarding the work and mission of the Society, I would like to discuss with you. We feel that the general shortcomings of the Society are that, except for a few members, the general members often do not pay attention to the affairs of the Society. The success of the Electrical Engineering Society lies in making each member interested and able to do their best to promote the affairs of the Society. As for the mission of the Society, it should focus on academic research and have a very broad vision. All issues related to the entire society and the country should be worked together and jointly researched to find appropriate solutions. As Premier Sun Yat-Sen said, catch up and do not miss the opportunity. I have great hope for the Electrical Engineering Society and wish the Society a promising future on behalf of Jiaotong University. After the speech, the entire assembly took pictures at Jiaotong University and were treated to lunch by Jiaotong University. The guests and hosts parted happily. At 2 pm,</p>
<p>a business meeting was held. Accounting Director Qiu Weiyu, Secretary Director Zhang Huikang, Chairman of the Publishing Committee Zhao Zengjue, Chairman of the Career Introduction Committee Zhang Tingjin, and Qiu Weiyu of the Electrical Engineering Terminology Review Committee reported on their work. The following were designated as members of the next election committee: Li Faduan, Hong Chuanjiong, Yang Jingtong, Shen Binglu, and Yu Ruxin, to be convened by Yang Jingtong.</p>
<p>Subsequently, proposals were discussed. The most important one was Yang Zhaokang's proposal that the physical terms in electrical engineering terminology should adopt the physical terms promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Bao Keyong proposed that before the promulgation of electrical engineering terminology, all electrical engineering publications should first adopt the physical terms promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Fan Chongwu proposed organizing an Electrical Standards Committee, etc., which were all approved. In the evening, the Electric Power Industry Thirteenth Group hosted a banquet for all members at the Bankers' Association, with welcome speeches by Tong Shixiang, Hu Xiyuan, Su Zhugui, and Liu Jinyu. Qiu Weiyu of the Society delivered a reply. They parted happily at 9 pm.</p>

<p>The first New Life Group Wedding Ceremony in this city was held on the 3rd in the City Hall Auditorium. Details have been recorded in various newspapers. The Social Affairs Bureau has been paying close attention to whether the married couples are following the New Life methods and practicing thrift. Before the event, they inquired of each married couple. Of the 57 couples, 8 only held family banquets without entertaining guests. On the evening of the 3rd, the bureau sent Sun Yongyi, director of the Public Welfare Section, and staff members Yan Wenkai and Lei Kenan to randomly inspect 16 households and visit the banquet locations and new couples' homes. The survey results showed that 1 household had 1 table of wine, 2 households had 2 tables, 1 household had 3 tables, 4 households had 4 tables, 2 households had 5 tables, and 1 household each had 6, 7, and 8 tables. Only 1 household held a large banquet for guests, and 1 household had a public banquet hosted by friends. Most families were able to understand the meaning of the New Life movement and save unnecessary expenses. The Social Affairs Bureau expressed deep satisfaction with this. It is reported that in the future, the format of the "Wedding Notice" for participants will be specified, stating that there will be no pretense and no gifts will be accepted, so that all citizens can reduce the burden of social expenses and make further reforms to shift away from extravagance and vulgarity.</p>

<p>The case of Jushunyi Sauce Garden at 187 Ximen Road in the French Concession being cut off from electricity by the French Municipal Council due to an increased liquor tax has been appealed to the Municipal Association Branch and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, but no solution has been found after ten days. The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent separate letters to the French Municipal Council Chinese Directors Lu Bohong, Zhu Yanzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhang Jixian, and Qi Yunqing, requesting them to seriously negotiate with the French authorities to uphold justice. The original letter is recorded as follows: To the Honorable Directors, upon investigation, the French Concession Municipal Council charges liquor taxes in three categories: seven yuan, three yuan eight jiao, and one yuan four jiao. Now, a five yuan category has been added, for a total of four categories. However, the Council does not consider the scope of business of the stores when collecting this liquor tax, but arbitrarily increases the tax. For example, the liquor tax for Jushunyi Sauce Garden, which is located in a remote area at 187 Ximen Road, Sapise Road, was 2 yuan 8 jiao last year. This year, without notice, it was suddenly increased to 5 yuan per month, and on March 25, the electricity was suddenly cut off due to non-payment of the tax. Although this matter is trivial, the Council's handling is unfair and using electricity cutoff as a weapon to oppress the people is inappropriate. We hope that you will negotiate the above situation with the Council, immediately restore the electricity to the business, and guarantee that the same disturbing events will not occur again in the future. This is what the Association earnestly hopes for.</p>

<p>The head office of the Kawah Savings Bank is located in Hong Kong, while Guangzhou and Shanghai are branches. On New Year's Day this year, the Hong Kong head office and the Guangdong branch simultaneously announced their closure. However, the Shanghai branch took no action after receiving the telegram and continued business as usual on January 4, after the three-day New Year's holiday, leading outsiders to believe that the branch had separated from the head office and was independent. As a result, many people sent money for storage on January 4. Little did they know that the branch was only hoping to attract more deposits by not immediately closing down. Although the result was still a declaration of closure on January 5, only extending the period by one day, the victims had increased to as many as eleven households, including Jiang Zhijia. They had obtained a huge amount of deposits of 3,896 yuan. This was because the eleven households, including Jiang, saw that the branch was still operating on January 4 and mistakenly believed that it would not perish with the head office. They all deposited their money. Unexpectedly, the closure was announced on the 5th, and they began to regret being deceived. Among these depositors, Jiang Zhijia held three promissory notes with a due date of January 10, totaling 1,530 yuan. The remaining ten households were all cash deposits. Therefore, only Jiang initially thought that he would not suffer any losses, because he had sent a letter to the liquidator of the branch, stating that the promissory notes did not need to be collected on his behalf. Even though he had notified them, it was too late, and the money had already been collected. As a result, the eleven depositors felt that Jiang had suffered the greatest loss. Now, Jiang, along with the other depositors, having investigated the responsible parties of the branch, including shareholders and Chairman Zhao Jinqing, shareholders and Counselors Li Yaobang, Zhang Danru, He [blank] Qiu, Deng Zhaozhen, Lin Zhizhou, Zhong Biao, shareholder and Supervisor Zhao Yaozhang, Huang Yougan, General Manager [blank] Xitian, Supervisor Zhang Xinei, Manager Bai Hongji, and Deputy Manager Shen Hegao, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the responsible parties, claiming that the plaintiffs' money was deposited in the branch on January 4 and that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for the savings deposits under the law, requesting a judgment ordering the defendants to jointly repay 3,896 yuan, plus statutory interest. The First Special Court has now scheduled the trial for this month on the 19th in the afternoon, but many of the defendants cannot be served because their addresses are unknown. Therefore, it is still unknown whether they can be summoned to court when the trial begins.</p>

<p>Ding Guangyou, a 33-year-old Yancheng native residing at 400 Maqi Road, Yidaizhao, is engaged in the business of renting out rickshaws. He had previously adopted his sister's daughter, Tang Xiaolong, aged 8, as his adopted daughter-in-law. Unexpectedly, in the first month of the lunar calendar this year, the girl suddenly fell ill and died on the evening of the 30th of last month. Upon hearing the news, Xiaolong's sister suspected that her sister's death was caused by abuse by the Ding couple, so she reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Chinese detective Liu Chunshu and others were ordered to investigate. Ding Guangyou was arrested and sent to the First Special Court for detention. At the same time, the girl's body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road. Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special Court Prosecutor's Office, and forensic doctor Wei Sangong and others visited the office to examine the body. Since there were no injuries on the surface of the deceased's body and the cause of death could not be determined, Guo approved the sister's consent and instructed forensic doctor Wei to dissect the body for detailed examination. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the results of the autopsy revealed that the girl's death was due to illness. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo and others went to the office again, and after explaining the autopsy process to the detectives of the police station and the family members, it was determined that the deceased Tang Xiaolong, female, died of illness before her death. Her sister Jiang Tang was asked to sign a guarantee and take the coffin back for burial.</p>

<p>Silage, an American businessman in Shanghai, originally from Austria and naturalized American, had been living in Shanghai for many years. He was the manager of the Taikang Machinery Company at 29 Yuanmingyuan Road and the owner of several horses at the racecourse. Mr. Silage resided in room 417 of the American Club on Fuzhou Road. He usually left in the morning and returned in the evening, and there was nothing unusual about him. However, in recent days, his attitude seemed to be negative. Yesterday morning, a servant at the American Club entered Mr. Silage's room 417 as usual to clean the room. When he pushed the door open, Mr. Silage suddenly fell to the ground, his blood vessels on both arms had been severed, and blood was flowing all over the floor. He felt cold to the touch and knew there was no hope of life. He reported it to the police station, and Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. The American Consulate General in Shanghai was immediately notified, and the consulate sent personnel to investigate the course and truth of the matter. According to the investigation, the cause of Mr. Silage's suicide was financial difficulties. Mr. Silage had re-mortgaged the horses at the racecourse to others. In recent years, the market has been depressed, and Mr. Silage, although a wealthy businessman, was also affected, so he took this drastic measure.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that Mr. Silage, the sales manager of the Taikang Foreign Firm, was found dead in his room this morning (5th) by a Westward-Ho of the American Club. It was found that it was caused by a severed artery. Mr. Silage had served as a major in the Austrian army and later became a naturalized American citizen. His family currently lives in the United States. He has been quite negative recently due to financial difficulties. He was good at riding, liked sports, and owned many racehorses.</p>

<p>Han Yungen, a Ningbo native who had previously served as the president of a certain bank, had been deeply concerned that his profligate son Han Peixian, who indulged in licentious activities, would implicate him. He had entrusted a lawyer to publish a solemn statement in the newspaper last year. However, Han Peixian initially did not heed his father's warnings and did not show any repentance. In late May of that year, he signed a pre-marriage agreement with the dancer Wang Xiaomei, promising to marry Xiaomei as his wife within the year. If he failed to marry her by the deadline, he would be willing to compensate her for the loss of 20,000 taels of silver. However, Peixian had already been married by his parents, and marrying again would not only be disallowed by his parents but also constitute bigamy. Therefore, he did not fulfill the agreement, causing Wang Xiaomei to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court for breach of contract and damages, claiming that after signing the agreement, she quit her dancing career, waited in her boudoir, and rejected other suitors. Now that Han had broken the agreement, the losses were severe and should be compensated as agreed. Judge Peng opened a trial and summoned the parties for questioning, and persuaded both parties to reconcile. However, Han Yungen was extremely resentful of his son's actions and was unwilling to pay for a settlement. Therefore, the case is still being judged by the presiding judge according to the law, ordering the defendant Han Peixian to compensate the plaintiff 3,000 yuan and bear the court costs.</p>

<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager and chairman of the China Merchants Bureau, was initially sentenced by the Shanghai District Court in September of the previous year for embezzlement of 700,000 taels of silver to three years in prison for breach of trust. Li was not satisfied and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court for the second instance, which changed the sentence to three and a half years for embezzlement. Li was still not satisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Because Li was chronically ill and feared inconvenience during travel, the High Court appointed Hu Shanhong, the chief judge of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Zhang Bingci and Zhang Zepu, and Prosecutors Hong Yu [blank], Shen Yuren, and Zhu Minghe, and two clerks, to come to Shanghai to conduct the trial at the First Tribunal of the Shanghai District Court. The trial concluded, and the date for sentencing was set for the 5th of this month. Yesterday was the scheduled date for sentencing. At 10 am, bailiff Chen Junfang and deputy bailiff Chen Xihui took a car to the Shanghai Hospital to bring Li Guojie to the court. The Public Security Bureau also sent Squad Leader Yu Ruhai of the Detective Squad and police officers to escort him in a car to ensure security. At 11 am, Hu Shanhong, the chief judge of the Criminal Court, along with the judges and prosecutors, took their seats in the First Tribunal and ordered Li Guojie to be brought to the dock. After briefly questioning his age and origin, Judge Hu rose and announced the judgment. In the case of Li Guojie's appeal for malfeasance, (main text) the original judgment regarding the crime of malfeasance is revoked. Li Guojie, with the intention of illegally possessing for himself, embezzled public property in his possession and is sentenced to imprisonment for one year and two months. The number of days detained before the judgment is finalized shall be credited at two days for one day of imprisonment. In the case of Li Guojie's appeal for civil suit for malfeasance, (main text) Li Guojie shall compensate the China Merchants Bureau 700,000 Shanghai guiyuan taels of silver, and shall pay interest at an annual rate of 8% from April 28 of the 22nd year of the Republic of China until the date of full repayment. If dissatisfied, he may appeal according to the law. After the judgment was completed, he was ordered to return Li to custody. Deputy bailiff Chen Xihui escorted Li into a car and drove him directly to Shanghai Hospital for custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Except for Lujia Hong Road and PuZhao Road, where main ditches have been constructed successively, the various roads east of Rihui Port in the southwest district of Shanghai rely on open ditches for drainage. Every time the summer and autumn seasons change, the low-lying areas retain polluted water, which is difficult to discharge, directly affecting the public health of citizens and indirectly harming the road surface. In view of this, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, after being approved by the Municipal Government, is now arranging for the construction of main ditches in Xietu Road (from Manufacturing Bureau Road to Xiaomuqiao Road), Manufacturing Bureau Road (from Xieqiao to Longhua Road), Dapu Road (from Xietu Road to Xiexu Road), and Jumen Road (from Xiexu Road to Xietu Road). Work has now begun. After the project is completed, not only can the city appearance be expected to be tidy, but also the residents along the road who have been suffering from the inability to solve the drainage problem due to the lack of main ditch facilities can apply to the Road Engineering Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works on Zhonghua Road for connection to the ditch according to the regulations. This will benefit public health and is not a small matter.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Railroad Intermodal Coffin Transport Exempts Transfer Station Handling Fees, Effective April 21 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday to cancel the transfer station handling fees for intermodal coffin transport, effective April 21. The original order is recorded as follows: According to the Intermodal Transport Office's case submission, the 58th case "Request to Regulate Coolie Fees at Transfer Stations for Intermodal Coffins" and the 59th case "Handling Fees for Intermodal Coffins Urgently Need to Be Regulated" were discussed at the 17th Domestic Intermodal Transport Conference. The 236th resolution stated that "It is clearly specified that transfer stations will collect handling fees and river crossing fees when crossing rivers." The investigation shows that charging handling fees at transfer stations is inconsistent with the principles of intermodal transport. Therefore, there are no regulations for charging handling fees at transfer stations for intermodal goods, luggage, and packages. If only the handling fees at transfer stations for intermodal coffins are to be charged, they should all be waived. If there are river crossing fees to be charged, they should be collected by the originating station along with the freight. As for re-transfer station handling or re-packaging fees, they should not be charged to the coffin owner or escort. Except for those handled by long-term employees hired by the railway, the various railways should give coolie subsidies according to the circumstances. No matter the railway or the coolie, no fees may be charged en route. It is scheduled to be implemented from April 21 of this year. If any station coolies demand money, they should be strictly punished to maintain the discipline of the road. In addition to separate orders, this order is to be followed. (This Bureau has already forwarded it to the Transportation Department for compliance)</p>

<p>Tang Haishan, owner of Tang Shengji Construction in Nanshi's Haichao Road, received an extortion letter on the 24th day of the old lunar first month. The letter was thrown in through a broken window. The letter requested a large loan, but Tang ignored it. A few days later, he received another letter with harsher language, reducing the extortion amount to the minimum of 500 yuan. The letter instructed him to bring the money between 11 AM and 12 PM on the 27th of last month, traveling along Haichao Road to Xie Bridge, where someone would contact him. He was instructed to carry an orange, a sugarcane, and a newspaper as codes. If he did not comply, he would receive "hygiene pills" (poison). At this point, Tang had no choice but to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team. Squad Leader Gu Liancheng, along with detectives Shen Jinchu and Hu Kui Sheng, disguised themselves. Tang instructed his employee, Gu Ayue, to follow the extortionist's instructions and fabricate the codes. As they approached Xie Bridge, a suspect approached Gu Ayue and asked, "Are you the representative? Did you bring the money?" Gu Ayue replied that it was in the newspaper. As the suspect reached to take it, Squad Leader Gu and the other detectives emerged from hiding and apprehended the suspect.

The suspect was transferred to the Third Section for questioning and will be handed over to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Peng Zaiyi, a 23-year-old Guangdong native residing at 203 Rue Lupan in the French Concession, was dancing on the evening of the 26th of last month with his friends Li Zhuo from Yunnan and Friderico Cotta Real (transliteration), a Portuguese national, and a dancer, 18-year-old Tang Mali from Guangdong, at the No. 1308 Avenue Edward VII dance hall. At the same time, Cheng Qilong from Haimen, was also hugging and dancing with a dancer, Wu Shan from Suzhou, when the two sides started a dispute because they stepped on each other's feet. Peng and the four men and women were taken by Cheng and others to No. 63 Rue de Potosi, Shanghai Film Research Institute, for illegal imprisonment. Cheng invited Li Gengen, a Hangzhou native who worked as a waiter, Zhang Quangen, a Wuxi native who filmed movies, Zhou Jianyong, a local native who drove a car, and others to come to Peng to extort eighty yuan. At that time, Peng only had four yuan on him, so he ordered Li Zhuo to go out to raise money as a reason to report to the French police station, which dispatched detectives to go and arrest Cheng and the other five men and women, and sent them to the Second Special Court for investigation. The report has been published in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Penghan of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the case and filed charges of hindering freedom and extortion under Articles 316 and 370 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff, Peng Zaiyi, testified that when I was dancing with Tang Mali that night, the defendant Cheng Qilong and Wu Shan were also dancing. Their arms hit me, and I didn't care. Later, the defendant bumped into me again and again, and when I reasoned with him, several people came forward and beat me. The boss in the dance hall said, "Let's go outside and talk," and Cheng and others took me and my friends out and took a rickshaw to Pushi Road for private imprisonment. The other defendants also followed and extorted eighty yuan from me. Wu Shan testified that on the 25th of last month, I was filming at the Star Company, and Peng teased me. Later, when I went out, Peng also teased me on the road. After returning home, I told my husband, Cheng Qilong. The next night, I happened to meet Peng at the dance hall, and I pointed it out to my husband. Cheng confessed that it was raining heavily that night, so he took the same car with Peng and there was no intimidation. All the other defendants pushed back and denied colluding in extortion, only Peng's friends invited me to a dinner the next day to mediate, etc. After reviewing the court's confession, it was deemed that the case still needs to be investigated, so it was postponed for ten days for further interrogation, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Shao Huang, a woman from Tianjin, hid 2,000 red pills on the morning of the 1st of this month and hired a rickshaw to travel near Tangshan Road and Dengtuo Road. She was searched by the Public Concession Police Search Team, West Detective Nadi and Egyptian female detective Peng Shi, etc., because her appearance was suspicious and her face was covered in smoke. They ordered her to stop and found the above-mentioned poison pills in her waistband and took her to Huishan Police Station, and transferred to the women's detention center. The next morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court. Industrial Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, and said that the defendant said at the police station that Jin Laolong from Shandong, who lived at 51 Taoyuanli, Baikai'er Road, asked her to bring it on his behalf, and paid two yuan. However, no one was found when detectives went to arrest him, please punish her severely. When asked, Shao's testimony was evasive, and she was ordered to be returned to custody to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced Shao Huang to six months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days, and the poison pills will be confiscated and burned.</p>

<p>Yu Hezhenya, a Guangdong woman living in a foreign-style house at No. 60 Avenue Petain in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits in front of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on Avenue Petain at 8:30 AM on October 21 of last year and held for ransom. On November 19, detectives and inspectors of the French Police Station, Jin Jiulin, sent detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, Zhou Bingcheng, and Tao Ronglin to Suzhou to arrest suspects Li Shengxiao and Wang Fukang, a member of the gang who was negotiating the ransom. They confessed that the victim was being held in a pavilion room at No. 386 Yulin Road. The French Police Station was notified by long-distance telephone. Inspector Jin led a team of detectives to Yulin Road Police Station that afternoon at 9:00 PM, and rescued the victim and arrested Tao Shuigen, Lin De, Zhang Huizhi, and Zhou Juqin, a woman guarding the victim, a total of six male and female criminals. Tao and Lin opened fire to resist arrest and were injured. At the same time, detective Zhang Chunsheng was also shot in the leg. They were sent to the hospital by the police station. Tao died of his injuries. Lin recovered and was sent to the Second Special Court by the police station. The Police Department lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits. Judge Xiong Yiping of successively opened a court session for trial. Because the kidnapped person, Yu Hezhenya, had to be summoned to the court for questioning, but Yu Hezhenya fell ill due to shock after being released and went to Peiping to recuperate, she was unable to attend the court. Therefore, the court sent photos of the criminals and a written request to the Peiping District Court to interrogate Yu Hezhenya nearby and wait for a reply before further interrogations. Now, the Second Special Court has received a document from the Peiping Court stating that Yu had reviewed the photos of the criminals and said that Wang Fukang, Tao Shuigen, and Lin De had carried out the kidnapping, while Tao Shuigen, Lin De, Zhang Huizhi, and Zhou Juqin were guarding the victim. During the period of detention, the bandits showed a large leather suitcase and threatened to kill her if they did not pay the ransom in a few days and put her in the suitcase. She often persuaded the bandits guarding her to repent and believe in religion, and had never met Li Shengxiao. Because Judge Xiong was transferred to the Third High Court, Judge Sun Penghan and Secretary Tao Zongkan came to the Criminal Court yesterday to continue the trial and announced a new trial. Wang Fukang, one of the main criminals, was seriously ill and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment and could not be brought to court. Li Ming, the lawyer hired by Li Shengxiao, was also present to wait for instructions. The official first asked the defendants who were in court for their names and ages. Then, Yao Zhaodi, the representative lawyer of the Police Department, stated the prosecution's intentions and the details of the case. The official ordered the defendants to be questioned separately. The confessions were the same as the previous confessions. As a result, because the key criminal Wang Fukang was not present, it was decided to postpone the trial to the 19th for further interrogation, and the defendants remained in custody awaiting instructions.</p>

<p>Patrolling Police Arrest Five Bandits; Confess to Being the Murderers of Zhao Xianglin</p>
<p>Zhou Yida, chief of the Hejiajiao substation of the Xujiahui police station in western Shanghai, along with police officers Yang Youlu, Li Renhai, Li Wenbin, Gao Yuefeng, and others, were patrolling the Zhongshan Road Hongqiao area yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM when they suddenly saw five people standing on the side of the road whispering to each other. Chief Zhou, seeing their suspicious behavior, was about to step forward to conduct a search when the group, feeling guilty, fled into the wheat fields. One of them, with a pockmarked face (namely Wang A'si), even dared to show a gun in resistance but was unexpectedly subdued by Yang Youlu and the six-inch live ammunition pistol, number 3980, was snatched away. The remaining four thieves, Zhou Jingsheng, Ding Qianhai, Shen Quan, and Chen Guilin, were chased all the way to the vicinity of Lujiazhai on the Fales Road before being apprehended one by one, with no one escaping. Flashlights, pills, pawn tickets, and other items were found on them. They were taken back to the station where, after strict interrogation by Director Hong Zhen, the thieves were exposed. According to Wang A'si's confession, he is 40 years old, from Wuxi, and lives in the workshop of the Yihua Yarn Factory in Yangshupu, working as a laborer. Yesterday, a foreman named Mr. Zhang and the five defendants opened room 17 of the Hongxiang Hotel in Nicheng Bridge to discuss fighting in Zhoujia Bridge. The gun was given to me by Mr. Zhang and was not for robbery. Today, after meeting the defendants and others on Zhongshan Road, I was arrested by the patrolling police. Zhou Quansheng confessed that he is 33 years old, from Changzhou, lives in a small inn, and makes a living as a laborer. Last night, he and the five defendants stayed in the Hongxiang Hotel. Wang A'si suggested robbing an old woman's house near a temple in western Shanghai. The gun belonged to Wang, and he asked me to meet him at the Wangjialou teahouse at 4 o'clock. Ding Qianhai confessed that he is 41 years old, from Changzhou, lives in Yishengli, Yangshupu, and works as a tailor. The rest of his confession was similar to Zhou Jingsheng's. Shen Longquan confessed that he is 32 years old, from Wuxi, lives at No. 34, Shen'anli, Tangshan Road, and works as a coppersmith in the Huatong Electric Factory. Last night, Wang A'si and the other five people opened a room in the Zhongshan Hotel in Lihong Bridge. Wang suggested robbing an old woman's sock factory on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. Wang had robbed it twice before. The gun was borrowed from Little Changzhou. The murderer who shot Zhao Xianglin was also them (referring to Wang and Little Changzhou). Chen Guilin confessed that he is 24 years old, from Wuxi, lives in Hengqingli, Beiler Road, and works as a vendor. The rest of his confession was the same as Zhou Jingsheng's. After hearing the confessions, Director Hong sent the five captured thieves, Wang A'si and others, along with the seized pistols and other items, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Police Chief Zhou Yida and police officer Yang Youlu, and others bravely captured the thieves, were loyal to their duties, and requested the director to commend them.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Declaration of the Fundraising Convention of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ting'an</p>
<p>The purpose of this association is solely to prevent and treat tuberculosis. It was established in October 1933. At that time, its trend was revealed; as for the methods of activity, in terms of prevention, we must awaken the people of the country to know the harm of tuberculosis attacks, obtain tuberculosis prevention knowledge, reform bad habits, and encourage each other, hoping to reduce tuberculosis and eradicate it; in terms of treatment, we must save the sick to restore health, which is also to prevent the spread of tuberculosis bacteria everywhere; in the past year, the matters that have been undertaken: one is to publish tuberculosis prevention magazines to impart tuberculosis prevention knowledge, the second is to hold summer children's health camps to enhance children's bodies and develop their tuberculosis prevention habits; the third is to set up the first and second tuberculosis clinics to provide free diagnosis and treatment for patients, but because of the prevalence of tuberculosis patients, the aforementioned undertakings are by no means effective, and we must strive for development. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the people of European and American countries have done their best for tuberculosis prevention work, those who suffered deeply from tuberculosis in the past have now been greatly reduced, and the greatest reason for their success is due to the meticulous organization of tuberculosis prevention groups and the enthusiastic support of the people in various places; how can the Chinese nation lag behind? After public deliberation, it was decided that: starting from April 6, 1935, we will widely solicit members to go to work together. The significance of soliciting membership is as follows:</p>
<p>1. The relationship on the ethnic front: About 1.6 million Chinese compatriots die from tuberculosis every year, and about 16 million people are infected. If we do not plan now, the situation will inevitably get worse year by year, which is the greatest scourge for the future of the nation. As a member of the nation, how can we not fulfill our responsibility?</p>
<p>2. The relationship on the national front: Because Chinese people are subjected to the aforementioned tuberculosis attacks, their physical strength is weakened, and the national power is declining. The disaster of destruction is imminent. As a member of the country, how can we not fulfill our responsibility!</p>
<p>3. The relationship on the socio-economic front: The cost of a person who dies of tuberculosis, from birth to burial, is about 1,500 yuan per person. If 1.6 million people die each year, then our entire socio-economic system will lose 2.4 billion yuan annually. The number is already alarming, and 16 million tuberculosis patients who cannot work can possibly increase the productive forces of the socio-economy, but instead become the socio-economy's waste. The loss to the entire socio-economy is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the socio-economic loss in our country due to tuberculosis is at least tens of billions of yuan each year. Assisting in tuberculosis prevention is enough to maintain the socio-economy, which is also to reduce one's own direct or indirect losses. As a member of society, how can we not fulfill our responsibility!</p>
<p>4. The relationship on the front of human morality: If we occasionally see any animal injured or sick and in pain, we will inevitably feel compassion. Now that we know that 1.6 million people die from tuberculosis every year, and 16 million people are trapped in tuberculosis, we must also think of the loneliness of the orphans of the deceased and the anxiety of the families of the sick. How is their sorrow and suffering! In terms of human morality, how can we not fulfill our responsibility!</p>
<p>Some may say that the significance of joining the association is as mentioned, but what is the actual effect on tuberculosis prevention? The answer is: the more like-minded people there are, the greater the effect will be. Success can be achieved, without waiting for hesitation. If you do not believe me, please check the course of the reduction of the tuberculosis rate and tuberculosis mortality rate in various countries, and you will know that the expectation of this association is not false. Compatriots, gentlemen, why not come? This declaration is all.</p>
<h3 id="e197">A Letter Respectfully Informing Leaders from All Walks of Life in the Country to Participate in Tuberculosis Prevention <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Fuqing</p>
<p>Chinese people often regard minor illnesses as unworthy of attention, and many people unknowingly lose their lives because of this. This kind of view is enough to mislead oneself and others, and it is enough to affect the national economy and the people's livelihood. Without mentioning other things, please take tuberculosis as an example; the entry of tuberculosis into the human body starts gradually, and the patient does not realize it, or thinks it is wind and cold, neglects treatment, or thinks it is hot and rashly uses coolants, so that 1.6 million people are sent to their deaths by it every year. These 1.6 million people are all young and productive members of society, and the direct and indirect impact on the country's population and economy cannot be calculated in quantity: not only that, but also those who transmit it to their children, called childhood tuberculosis, and those who linger in bed for more than 40 years and never recover, called lifelong tuberculosis. Just imagine how many people are neither alive nor dead? Speaking of it is truly alarming! According to reports from various sources: this disease accounts for 4,000 out of every 100,000 people. China's population is 400 million, so there are 16 million people in the country. This 16 million tuberculosis experts spread it to each other, increasing year by year, so our entire nation will not be destroyed by others, and we will not be able to survive in the world. Just imagine what a terrible and tragic thing this is!</p>
<p>In view of this, the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established in October 1933 by uniting comrades from all walks of life. The purpose is to awaken the Chinese people to the seriousness of tuberculosis, to pay attention to it, to prevent it, and to resist it; and to give those who are already ill practical remedial treatment and guide them in the methods of health preservation. Since its establishment, although the time is very short, the work that has been done is fortunately also slightly scaled (see the work report of this association). At the time of the annual meeting, reviewing the past and encouraging the future, we feel even more that the tuberculosis prevention cause is of great importance to the national population and economy. In order to implement the original intention and improve the health of the nation, a three-year plan has been drawn up to promote it step by step and realize it as soon as possible. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved by the strength of a few people. I hope that leaders from all walks of life will call out loudly, so that all the mountains will respond, and the masses will work together to achieve this great event. I think those who care about the people will be happy to support it.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Review of the Association's Establishment and One Year of Work <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Junjun</p>
<p>This association was jointly initiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who contacted leaders from Chinese and foreign circles, as well as giants in the medical field. The inaugural meeting was held at the municipal government reception office on Xiafei Road on October 22nd of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933). Over 250 people attended, including Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xianxi, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Niu Huisheng, Li Ting'an, and Xu Shiying. Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, the gist of which was: The harm of tuberculosis is well known. In our country, approximately 1.6 million people die from this disease each year, and nearly 10 million are affected. Moreover, the majority are young, productive members of society, which has a very significant impact on the social economy! Fifty years ago, the prevalence of tuberculosis in many European and American countries was not much different from that in our country. However, due to effective prevention methods, the mortality rate from tuberculosis plummeted. For example, in England in 1875, the tuberculosis mortality rate was slightly less than 300 per 100,000, but now it has dropped to around 70. This is evidence of the effectiveness of tuberculosis prevention. According to surveys, the mortality rate in our country is more than six times higher than that in England, and as many as 40% of children under the age of fourteen are infected. If we do not take active preventive measures, what will become of the nation and the people? For this reason, I have specially contacted famous Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai, as well as giants in the medical field, to jointly initiate the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association, to plan preventive measures, so as to strengthen the physique of the nation. However, this matter is very important. It is not easy to achieve results without collective efforts, step-by-step planning, and a sound organization. Now that we have the enthusiastic participation of leaders from all walks of life, the future development of this association will surely be limitless. After Wu Tiecheng finished his speech, the various ongoing matters and membership types were discussed. It was resolved that anyone who wishes to join the association can become a member, regardless of gender or nationality. The categories are divided into two types: (1) Group members, limited to legal organizations; (2) Individual members, divided into four types: ordinary members, sustaining members, permanent members, and student members. Subsequently, honorary presidents, executive directors, supervisors, and directors were elected. Wu Tiecheng was elected as honorary president, Madame Liu Ruiheng Kong Yongzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, and Xu Xinliu as honorary vice presidents, Niu Huisheng as chairman, and Li Ting'an as vice chairman. Zhu Hengbi, Yan Fuqing, Wu Liande, Wu Tiecheng, Bu Mei, Madame Xiao Zhiji, and J.A. Snell were elected as executive directors. Du Yuesheng, Ding Fubao, Liang Xiaochu, Lu Bohong, Shi Liangcai, Cai Xiangsun, Pang Jingzhou, and Chu Minyi were elected as supervisors. Liu Hongsheng and Kuang Fuzhuo. Lu Ganchen, Huang Renzhi, Lin Kanghou, Gu Yuqi, Zhu Qinglan, Wu Yun Chu, Ding Shujing, Li Denghui, Xu Jianping, Guo Shun, Xu Shiying, Dong Xian Guang, Hu Yunqiu, Pan Gongzhan, Li Zuwei, Jin Shuchu, Lu Yongchun, Diao Xinde, Chen Zhifang, Chen Wanli, Li Dachao, Tan Shixin, Wang Shuzhen, He Chichang, Jin Baoshan, Liu Wang Liming, Wu Xingya, Wang Xiaoying, Hu Xuanming, Song Guobin, Qian Muhan, J. Raberf S.M. Gurn. G.R. Fitcb C.M. Van Allen. J. H. Jordan. E. C. Lobenstin and others were elected as directors. All of the above was handled by Mr. Yang Huaiseng, an executive of the National Youth Association. Mr. Yang has always been very enthusiastic about public affairs. Since taking office as temporary executive secretary, he has planned everything and proceeded in various ways, which has begun to take shape. The above is the process of the establishment of this association. Now, the general situation of the association's work over the past year is described below:</p>
<p>(1) Re-employment of Staff: On December 14th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), Mr. Zhang Junjun was hired as the executive director of the association, and Mr. Li Chaozhang and others were hired to assist in all matters. Mr. Yang immediately handed over the various affairs to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li to be responsible for. After the staff was hired, the work began to proceed. (2) Holding the First Membership Drive: On the evening of December 15th of the same year, a public banquet was held at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association to entertain leaders from all walks of life, and the first membership drive was held. More than 80 people, including male and female captains and persons in charge of the association, such as Zhang Junjun and Li Chaozhang, were immediately appointed. The captains proceeded separately with enthusiasm to introduce the association, and the number of people who joined was very enthusiastic, and the result was quite impressive. (3) Reception for the Press: At 4:00 p.m. on January 12th, the local press was invited to the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, and an anti-tuberculosis film was shown. Those who attended included Li Ting'an, Director of the Bureau of Health, Yan Fuqing, President of the Red Cross Hospital, Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, and more than 40 reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Yan delivered a speech first, followed by a speech by Li Ting'an. Finally, there was a tea party, and educational films on tuberculosis prevention were shown, which explained the growth and treatment of tuberculosis bacteria in great detail. It was not until about 6:00 p.m. that everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>(4) Reception for Church Leaders: At 4:00 p.m. on January 19th, a meeting of church leaders was held at the association. Those who attended included Ting'an, Lai Douyan, Zhu Hengbi, Zhang Wei, Tian Cuibin, and Tu Baoluo. Li Ting'an, the chairman, delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches by Dr. Lai Douyan and Zhang Wei, which stated that the number of people suffering from tuberculosis in China is the highest in the world, and the loss of talent and the waste of treatment are far greater than the annual civil war. We should pay close attention to public and personal hygiene to prevent tuberculosis from spreading further. Zhang Junjun then reported on the association's affairs, followed by a tea party, and Wu Zengui of Kodak Company screened anti-tuberculosis films. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>(5) Anti-Tuberculosis Broadcasting and Lectures: From January to March, President Yan Fuqing, Director Li Ting'an, Principal Weng Zhilong, Dr. Bu Mei, Dr. Zhang Wei, and Zhang Junjun were successively invited to the Gospel Broadcasting Station to give lectures on methods of preventing and treating tuberculosis. The active publicity was well received by the citizens. In the winter of last year, experts were continuously invited to give lectures, and staff were sent to major middle schools to promote national health and methods of preventing tuberculosis. According to statistics, there were 50 lectures last year, with approximately 100 to 1,200 listeners each time, which shows the attention paid to the issue of tuberculosis by all parties.</p>
<p>(6) Holding a Fundraising Campaign: On March 15th, Wu Tiecheng, Honorary President of the Association, hosted a banquet for celebrities from all walks of life in the city, and at the same time held a fundraising campaign, which was very successful. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Wen Lanting, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Shi Liangcai, Mr. Liu Zhi and others all enthusiastically donated to promote the realization of the association's cause. Their spirit of serving the public is truly commendable. In addition, donations were widely solicited from celebrities, directors, and groups, and a total of 21,895.92 yuan was received in donations and membership fees, which enabled the association's work to be gradually realized. (7) Establishing a Tuberculosis Clinic: In order to meet the needs of society and promote the health of the people, the association established the first tuberculosis clinic at No. 306 Xilin Road, on the corner of Ximen Fangxie Road, on June 14th. In order to reduce the burden on the people and fulfill the mission of charitable relief, no consultation fees or medicine fees are charged. Since its establishment, the number of citizens who have visited the clinic for treatment by the end of December is 293 for initial consultations and 634 for follow-up consultations. This shows the prevalence of tuberculosis among the citizens.</p>
<p>(8) Nurses Visiting Patients' Homes: Since the establishment of the first clinic, the association hired Ms. Zhu Xiaopei and Shen Zongying to work as nurses. Every morning, they visited patients' homes separately to tell them about methods of prevention and treatment. After this news was released, patients' families requested nurses to visit them one after another. The seriousness of the tuberculosis problem is truly chilling!</p>
<p>(9) Holding a Children's Health Camp: In mid-June, the association prepared for a summer children's health camp. Later, the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Children's Welfare Association, and the Chen Bao Newspaper all requested to join in the joint organization. Therefore, the five groups prepared to open the camp on July 6th. A total of 60 boys and girls registered to join. The general situation of the process and daily life have already been announced in the newspapers and published in the association's Anti-Tuberculosis Magazine, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>(10) The Association's Work in the 13th Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign: The 13th Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign began on June 19th of last year. The association belonged to the Anti-Tuberculosis Group, so it carried out a large-scale anti-tuberculosis publicity campaign. It was planned that during the one week of the conference, leaders and celebrities from all walks of life in the city would be invited to give lectures on tuberculosis prevention. Every time a lecture was given, there were 500 to 600 enthusiastic listeners, which was unprecedented. Prior to the event, the association also sent letters to various hospitals in the city and the Shanghai Medical Association, requesting them to ask registered physicians to provide free physical examinations for citizens and half-price X-rays, all of which were accepted. A large number of people visited the physicians for treatment every day, and the hospitals, such as the Shanghai Plague Hospital, Guangren Hospital, Chinese Red Cross Hospital, and Sacred Heart Hospital, were so busy with physical examinations and X-rays that they could barely keep up.</p>
<p>(11) The Association's Book Donation: The association has prepared three books by Ding Fubao: "Guide to Lung Disease," "Lung Disease Treatment," and "Lung Disease Prevention," totaling more than 1,900 copies. The donation began on January 5th of last year. Because the books are rich in content, covering all aspects of tuberculosis prevention, treatment, and the common knowledge that patients should have, after the news spread, requests for the books poured in, and more than 1,800 copies were donated by the end of December. The large number of people suffering from the disease in the country can be seen from this. There are still some copies of the book remaining.</p>
<p>(12) Publication of the Anti-Tuberculosis Magazine: In order to popularize tuberculosis prevention education, the association has been preparing for several times, and the Anti-Tuberculosis Magazine was launched on November 1st. Mr. Kong Yongzhi, Wang Shijie, Chen Gongbo, Huang Shaoxiong, Liu Ruiheng and other gentlemen wrote inscriptions in support. In addition, the giants of the medical community across the country served as special editors. After the publication, it was warmly loved by all walks of life, and subscriptions poured in. The association is ashamed to receive this support and will continue to work hard to live up to the expectations of all parties. (13) Tuberculosis Vaccine Testing: Dr. Tang Shinian of the First Clinic is responsible for carrying out tuberculosis vaccine testing. Because tuberculosis is most likely to occur in children, in order to understand the prevalence of tuberculosis in China, it is necessary to carry out this academic test. The tuberculin reaction test (vaccine test) was performed on 385 students at Shanghai Middle School and Experimental Primary School, aged between 5 and 16. The method used was the Manfaux Intwcutaneous Method, and the dose used was O.T.roooo6 Gm. The results of the test on the 385 people are listed below:</p>
<p>Total Number Positive Reaction Negative Reaction Percentage of Positive Reactions</p>
<p>Under 5 years old 3 1 2 33.30%</p>
<p>6 to 10 years old 180 98 82 54.40%</p>
<p>11 to 15 years old 194 152 42 78.35%</p>
<p>Over 16 years old 5 4 1 80.00%</p>
<p>Although the number of people tested in the above table is small and is not enough to draw a conclusion, the phenomenon of school-age children showing a positive reaction to the tuberculin test indicates that the number of tuberculosis bacteria invading the body gradually increases with age. This is consistent with the results obtained by the Red Cross Society Gao Yishi in recent years. Few adults over the age of 20 are not invaded by tuberculosis bacteria. (14) Opening of the Second Clinic: In view of the large number of tuberculosis patients and the fact that Shanghai has a vast area and a large population, and the existing hospitals are not enough to meet the demand, the association is planning everything and actively adding tuberculosis clinics to benefit the citizens. The Third Clinic officially opened on April 2nd. The address is in Nanshi (15) Purchasing X-ray Machine with Huge Sum of Money: In order to facilitate the treatment of tuberculosis, the latest X-ray machine was ordered from the United States at a cost of 5,000 yuan in national currency. The machine is for the use of the Second Clinic. Patients who wish to be examined and photographed can go directly to the Shanghai Hospital Association Second Clinic for contact. (16) The Association's Hopes: Whether the work of tuberculosis prevention can be developed and whether the progress can be smooth depends on the amount of economic capacity. The association's various tasks are in active progress, but they are limited by economics and many have not been realized. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate, either as members or by soliciting donations on behalf of the association, so that the association's cause will thrive and the work of tuberculosis prevention will spread throughout the country. This will not only be a blessing for the future of the nation, but the association will also be honored.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Leisure <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Yinxi, the Prince Shen of the Qing Dynasty, was very good at writing poetry. He once wrote a woodcutter's song, which said:</p>
<p>No human voices heard, only the sound of axes, the silent echo of the rocks, the startled birds flying away with a ding. Getting firewood to exchange for wine, returning drunk, stepping on the moon, singing mountain songs clearly; befriending wood and stone, without decline or glory, white clouds and flowing water from morning to evening, ten thousand mountains hazy with green smoke.</p>
<p>"Getting firewood to exchange for wine, returning drunk, stepping on the moon, singing mountain songs clearly; befriending wood and stone, without decline or glory," this is leisure, which is envied by many meat-eating friends. Yinxi, as a prince, loved elegance, letting his brother Yinzhen - Yongzheng - indulge in being emperor, suspicious, suppressing, and killing; while he traveled around mountains and rivers, wrote poetry and painted, acting as a carefree gentleman.</p>
<p>He wanted to enjoy leisure.</p>
<p>And he also bestowed this leisure on the woodcutter who "befriends wood and stone, without decline or glory." "Getting firewood to exchange for wine, returning drunk, stepping on the moon," the fortune is indeed very good, but this only expresses the leisure and elegance of talented scholars. In fact, the woodcutters who rely on two arms and an axe to chop wood in the mountains every day do not understand it. They only know about getting firewood to exchange for rice, and returning hungry, stepping on the moon. But if you were to say that, this would not be considered leisure, but rather a bit like hardship.</p>
<p>And hardship is not what elegant gentlemen enjoy talking about.</p>
<p>But it is still a fact that the woodcutters have no leisure to enjoy. Relying on a few poems and essays of leisure and elegance will not reverse the case in the end. The biggest evidence is the lack of money. Escaping the summer heat in Mount Lu and exploring the plum blossoms in Dengwei can also be considered leisure, but the woodcutters in Mount Lu still have to sweat, because they still have to work; the plum trees in Dengwei are only allowed to be admired, not chopped down. The casual interest of the elegant gentlemen shattered the rice bowls of the woodcutters who were holding axes.</p>
<p>Leisure has become the enemy of the poor in this way.</p>
<p>However, in Yongzheng's view, it was still worth promoting. He once changed the names of his brothers Yinxi and Yinsi to "Aqina" and "Seshei," "Aqina" meaning dog in Manchu, and "Seshei" meaning pig. These two, a dog and a pig, were imprisoned by Yongzheng for forming a party to plot rebellion, so that they could get rid of their worldly desires and enjoy some leisure.</p>
<p>Yinxi's watching flowers and admiring the moon, playing with antiques, and brewing good tea may be the so-called "sending sorrow to seclusion," but his leisure erases the facts before him, and he has long become a "Seshei" that is clear at a glance.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Poor Opera Troupe <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>I once heard a ridiculous story about a poor opera troupe. The friends in the audience laughed until tears flowed out, because the story not only described the simplicity of a certain opera troupe, but also explained how the desires of the Chinese people are satisfied by what is supplied - which seems to explain something else as well.</p>
<p>The storyteller first introduced the fat female troupe leader. She was sitting at the entrance of the theater, with a large bamboo basket beside her; another male clerk stood on the other side of the entrance. The two of them held a straw rope in their hands. The audience threw two strings of cash into the bamboo basket, and they would lower the straw rope to let them in.</p>
<p>Secondly, he introduced the boots of the opera troupe. There was only one boot, and four characters had to show their right foot in front of the audience. This was naturally difficult. Therefore, the first one to walk had the natural right to enjoy the boots first. He walked to the stage, slowly kicked out one foot, and the boot was clearly revealed. Then he bent his foot backwards, and the second character who was about to come forward bent down to take off the boot for him - the people who heard this laughed.</p>
<p>He was talking about something that happened in a certain county in Sichuan. But anyone knows that this situation is common in China. Audiences everywhere show the same surprising degree of patience.</p>
<p>I also encountered a poor opera troupe in a small town in Guangdong. The actors were all elderly people. When the people in the town boasted that they had this group of old artists, they raised their thumbs and whispered: "Real beards and false teeth!" At other times, they would roar other praises: "Isn't it true that there are more officials than soldiers, more soldiers than guns, and more guns than bullets!"</p>
<p>A general walked out on the stage, presumably a commander-in-chief, shouting: "All the generals!" The four or five drummers next to him represented his subordinates and answered in unison: "Yes!" In fact, there was only one person acting. Later I learned that the good characters in the troupe refused to play soldiers, for fear of losing their status, and there were no bad characters.</p>
<p>When a young lady appeared on the stage without a bun, the drummers on the side would temporarily make a forced female response when she needed to be called.</p>
<p>In the past, the rules of Guangdong stage plays were that the performance had to continue until dawn. Before two or three o'clock, they performed the so-called wonderful part, and after that, it was a drag show. The people on the stage acted casually, and the people under the stage watched while dozing off, just waiting for dawn.</p>
<p>Once, after performing a play called "Shandong Outlaws" - which they called "the main attraction" - I saw a character who claimed to be an imperial envoy coming out from backstage to interrogate a female prisoner. There were no runners, no jailers, and not even a female prisoner. There was only a table, a gavel, and the imperial envoy himself on the stage.</p>
<p>The virtual female prisoner was probably the woman of a pirate who rebelled against the government, beautiful and full of integrity. The imperial envoy began by roaring and cursing her menacingly, saying that she "did not restrain herself and repeatedly troubled the heavens," threatening her with beheading; later, seeing that she was beautiful, he flirted with her with a smile, wanting to talk about love with her, with the warning that "obey me and live, disobey me and die." His fierce expression and love-making tactics sometimes seemed quite frightening. When dawn came, he didn't care whether the female prisoner was willing or not, and said to himself, "Now that it's dawn, the play has to be finished, you can come with me to the back room to sleep! Let's go."</p>
<h3 id="e201">Comedy <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Black Cherry</p>
<p>A deep night; there wasn't a sound on the street, making it seem unusually desolate. The northwest wind howled, and the police officer standing at the corner covered his ears with his collar, his legs trembling incessantly. The streetlights cast a pale light on the straight asphalt road. A whirlwind-like gust played with the weary people returning home, then vanished in an instant. Inside a 24-hour Cantonese restaurant, a few people were huddled around the stove, eating shrimp wontons, watching the desolate street, lacking the courage to step outside. A rickshaw was parked outside; the middle-aged driver stared blankly as the steaming wontons were delivered to others' mouths, suddenly feeling a pang of hunger himself, saliva welling up in the corner of his mouth, feeling extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Just staring at other people eating? You really are a bastard!"</p>
<p>Someone said this sarcastically. The bastard quickly swallowed his saliva and turned around to look for the speaker. All that was presented to him was a dark smile filled with contempt; the young man from Jiangbei, sitting on the rickshaw frame, held a half-smoked cigarette in his mouth, looking sly. He wanted to vent his anger on the young man, but he couldn't; he had to be patient.</p>
<p>"Damn it—" He didn't know who he was cursing.</p>
<p>At this moment, a rickshaw was being pulled toward them from afar. Sitting on the cushion was a ×× sailor, wearing a round hat and a navy uniform with a large collar. He propped up his legs and kicked the rickshaw driver in the back almost every two minutes. The rickshaw driver, biting his teeth, ran forward, the sound of his footsteps clearly echoing in the deep night, reaching everyone's ears. His heart was jumping, as if countless pebbles were rising and falling inside him, he thought he had met a devil tonight. He ran straight ahead—where on earth was this guy going? He seemed to have drunk a lot of alcohol; sometimes he muttered to himself; he never told the rickshaw driver where he wanted to go. He had been pulling for almost half an hour, running aimlessly, he really didn't know how it would end. Cold sweat broke out on his body; he was so anxious that he wanted to cry!</p>
<p>Suddenly, an unbearable kick landed on his back, almost knocking him onto the street; the sailor in the rickshaw, however, started yelling irritably, as if the rickshaw had done something wrong, shouting loudly. But no one could understand what he was yelling. At this time, the rickshaw was in front of the Cantonese restaurant, and some busybodies immediately left their wontons or raw fish congee and came out to watch the excitement. The unfortunate fellow who had been drooling because of his hunger and some of the rickshaw drivers also stood together, waiting for their companion to be humiliated by the ×× sailor until he cried.</p>
<p>The rickshaw stopped.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's going on!" the young man from Jiangbei asked. "He's crying! The ×× devil is still hitting him, this is outrageous!"</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>The ×× sailor used his fists and leather boots to beat the short, clumsy rickshaw driver, who didn't resist at all. The onlookers, however, had no sympathy, no righteous indignation, all standing there blankly as if they were watching a movie. The injured rickshaw driver looked at his compatriots with pleading eyes, begging for help; but no one gave him any reaction...</p>
<p>The shop assistant stood at the door, "Look, how interesting!" He even pulled the accountant from inside.</p>
<p>"You still say it's interesting! The rickshaw driver is already kneeling on the ground begging for mercy," the accountant said heavily, adjusting his nearsighted glasses.</p>
<p>Yes, the rickshaw driver did not resist after being humiliated, but instead begged for mercy. He knelt in front of the sailor in such a pitiful, servile manner, calling out in a low voice: "Master... ×× Great Master!... Spare my life!" Because he knew that the "Great Master" could even stab him to death, he was so scared that his face turned the color of green vegetables, begging for forgiveness in this way.</p>
<p>The ×× sailor, however, was satisfied and burst out laughing. Following the loud laughter like a waterfall, the audience also burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"Stupid thing, why don't you get up and run for your life?" Someone gently nudged the suffering man with his toe.</p>
<p>"Oh God..."</p>
<p>Crying out, he got up and quickly pulled the rickshaw away.</p>
<p>The police officer came over at this time and asked the onlookers, "What's going on?" However, no one answered him. Within three minutes, everyone had dispersed, some returning to the Cantonese restaurant to eat the half-bowl of raw fish congee left on the table; the young man from Jiangbei cursed the ×× devil, but he didn't dare to help the man who had just been humiliated. The victorious sailor rushed into a bar; the northwest wind was left blowing on the street, the streetlights shone coldly, and everything was as calm as if there had been no disturbance at all...</p>
<h3 id="e202">En Route <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>One of the Lake Tour Miscellanea</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, I was very happy, but when I looked at the heavily clouded sky, I was extremely disappointed; because in this kind of weather, it's not suitable to tour West Lake, and today was the scheduled day to depart for West Lake.</p>
<p>Regardless, I finally took my bedding and sat on a rickshaw to go to the station.</p>
<p>I've lived in Shanghai for five or six years, but I haven't been to West Lake yet. This is such a regrettable thing! Shanghai and West Lake are so close; not going to stroll around shows how lazy I am.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the station, the group of twenty-some people I was joining had already arrived. A group of students were jumping and bouncing, their joyful and eager state making it seem as if it would be good to arrive at West Lake immediately. They complained about the bad weather on the one hand, and on the other hand, they were afraid of rain. Fortunately, the rain hadn't started falling until after they boarded the train; instead, the sun bravely poked its head out after a while. Everyone was beaming with joy.</p>
<p>The train started, and with nothing to do, I opened a book of "Essays and Cartoons." I originally had a habit of preferring to look at the scenery along the way when riding the train, rather than reading books, even if it was just looking at plain fields and weeds; but this time, from the North Station all the way to Jiaxing, because I had traveled this route two or three times already, I was more familiar with the road, so I took a shortcut. I decided that I would look at the scenery outside the train window after the train passed Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Heaven didn't fulfill people's wishes. The sun had already been obscured by haze before the train even reached the Xinlonghua Station, and it even started drizzling after passing Jiaxing.</p>
<p>"How unlucky, it's actually starting to rain."</p>
<p>"Heaven really doesn't fulfill people's wishes, why does it deliberately make things difficult for people!"</p>
<p>"It's been raining for several days in a row, it should be clearing up, all it does is rain, endless rain!"</p>
<p>In the train carriage, some people were airing their grievances.</p>
<p>The weather gradually got colder, and I put on my cotton robe. I hadn't planned to bring this clothing in the morning, but I didn't expect that it would come in handy. The raindrops on the glass window slowly increased, obscuring my vision, and I couldn't see the scenery outside clearly.</p>
<p>Overall, I was lucky. Although the rain obscured the scenery outside the train window, there was something to spoil the scenery in the carriage: some students from Shanghai ×× College. They were putting on a civil drama without collecting tickets. Some of these college students were graduating (there was even a banner saying "Graduation Observation Group"?), and some, although they hadn't graduated yet, were all waiting to wear square caps. They deliberately made strange noises and exaggerated expressions, showing off their sex appeal. Because there were both men and women, the fun in the middle was even more pronounced, and good plays are never afraid of being continuous, people naturally want to watch, so it was very lively.</p>
<p>Looking at the group of middle school students sitting next to me, no, they were far behind, only able to watch others act stupidly, but unable to act themselves. This is probably due to a lack of ability. I secretly wished these middle school students watching the play would quickly improve, and after entering university, they could come to West Lake for a tour and perform a slapstick comedy in the carriage as well.</p>
<p>The rain fell harder and harder, no, denser, but not heavy, nor urgent. By the time we arrived in Hangzhou, it hadn't stopped yet. While getting off the train, I worried about touring the lake tomorrow. If only someone dared to guarantee that it would be sunny tomorrow, I would be willing to recite Amitabha Buddha ten times, I definitely wouldn't find it troublesome.</p>
<p>Our group of people got into rickshaws and headed towards the Girls' Middle School, which was our temporary lodging.</p>

<p>— Ding Lang</p>
<p>Harsh winter suppressed their hunger, creditors temporarily lightened their footsteps; hoes drove away fatigue, once a year, it is spring again! The shimmering water threads through the fields, the fine rain awakens their life, the straw hats, the rain capes, filling them with excitement, the mud burying their legs, moving and moving searching for life. Hope permeates their hearts: 'Hope it won't be like last year's harvest'?</p>
<h3 id="e204">Mr. Juqing (8) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Although the principal is young, he has a very good idea: a strike. Wearing a pair of gold-rimmed tortoise-shell glasses, with a Western suit over his long robe, and leather shoes, he raised his voice, which had just broken, and delivered a passionate speech to the students: 'Everyone, children, go back and tell your families: Originally, we should have started classes a long time ago; but the former school director refused to hand over, there were no operating funds, so we had no choice but to not start classes! We should overthrow this... this... "reactionary element"!'</p>
<p>—Things were at a standstill.</p>
<p>In less than two or three days, this news spread throughout the town like an autumn wind. The students' fathers and elder brothers frowned; but the general tutors were enthusiastically inquiring about this matter everywhere, grinning as they listened to people talking, and then talking to other people about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing also became a little excited. He didn't just feel the pleasure of watching a fire from across the river about this matter; he knew that if things escalated, it might have a positive impact on him. —In recent days, whenever it was time for school to let out in the evening, Mr. Juqing's triangular monkey face often appeared on the street.</p>
<p>This evening, Mr. Juqing was running along the East Street in the dim twilight, preparing to go see a friend to inquire about news. Suddenly, an old man wearing a blue cloth robe and a felt hat came towards him and greeted Mr. Juqing with a cupped fist:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr.! How coincidental, I was just about to come visit you."</p>
<p>Hearing the voice, it was Soy Sauce Fu, the shopkeeper of Yuxing Soy Sauce Shop on East Street. He then grabbed Mr. Juqing's arm and ran into a small tavern.</p>
<p>A small plate of peanuts, a small plate of dried tofu, they sat down in the "private room" behind the dark "Qinglong Pi" liquor. Soy Sauce Fu said:</p>
<p>"Mr., do you know? My shop has been sealed by the school."</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing had just heard people talking about this news; but he made a very surprised expression: "Oh, why?"</p>
<p>Soy Sauce Fu coughed and told him: the shop of Yuxing is the property of the district-run elementary school, rented from the school. Last year, Chu Runfu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, was the school director, and he collected the rent for March this year; this year, Zhang Xiaofeng took office again, but he forced Fu to pay again, saying that it had already been paid to the former school director. There was no effect. The principal, without distinguishing right from wrong, said that they were intentionally delaying payment, undermining education. A letter was sent to the town's Public Security Bureau, and Yuxing Soy Sauce Shop was closed on the same day, sealed with a cross-shaped strip. —</p>

<h3 id="e205">All Schools Handling Boy Scouts Must Hire Full-Time Coaches, Ministry of Education Orders All Departments and Bureaus <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The Ministry of Education ordered all departments and bureaus, citing a letter from the General Association of the Boy Scouts of China, stating that most of the Boy Scout groups in various regions are run by schools, and there is no fixed funding. Most of them cannot hire full-time coaches. Some are staffed by physical education teachers, and some are randomly taught by ordinary teachers, resulting in many errors in academics and many disorders in discipline for the Boy Scouts. This is contrary to the original purpose of promoting the Boy Scout cause. Further investigation reveals that your ministry has already issued a general order to all junior high schools in the country to uniformly implement Boy Scout training, and Boy Scout funding has been included in the school budget. Now that funding is secured, hiring full-time coaches should be easy. Therefore, it is proposed that your ministry issue a general order to all schools that, in the future, all Boy Scouts must hire full-time coaches in order to increase efficiency, etc. Approved. Further investigation reveals that the implementation of Boy Scout training in junior high schools and Boy Scout equipment costs should be included in the school budget, as previously ordered by the Ministry in June of last year. All Boy Scout coaches in various schools should hire full-time coaches. This order must be strictly observed.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Ministry of Education Instructs Tongji University to Improve <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The Ministry of Education instructed National Tongji University, stating that the school had been inspected by the Ministry, and the submitted report had been reviewed. The school's teachers are experienced in teaching, committed to research, and very motivated. Students are diligent and disciplined, and the school spirit is quite strict, which is gratifying. However, the following points still need to be strictly improved: (1) The school's administrative organization does not have deans in each college, which is inconsistent with the university organization law. In the future, each college should set up a dean to manage college affairs, and the university should set up a Department of Academic Affairs with a director to handle all school teaching matters under the direction of the president. The original Department of Academic Affairs in each college should be abolished. The qualifications, treatment, and dismissal of hired professors should be properly formulated into regulations and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The library organization is too cumbersome, and the number of school workers exceeds the need, which can be reduced as appropriate. Training matters need to be added with specialists, actively guiding. The tables and statistics used by the school, after investigation, have a special German version, which is not appropriate. In the future, all should be changed to Chinese as the primary language. (2) The school's financial allocation method has more public funds than equipment costs, resulting in deviations from the Ministry's set standards. The affiliated high school's annual expenditure accounts for one-sixth of the school's total funding, which is quite high. However, the instruments, medicines, specimens, and necessary equipment for the surveying and civil engineering departments required for physics, chemistry, and biology experiments are still lacking. Reference books for each department are also insufficient. In the future, efforts should be made to economize on office expenses and reduce the funding for the affiliated high school to enrich equipment and benefit teaching. (3) The school's affiliated senior high school is divided into two colleges for management, which is inconvenient. The equipment for books and physics, chemistry, and biology is insufficient for application. The teaching method focuses on lectures and neglects experiments. The students' level, except for German, is quite uneven. The staff is not serious about handling affairs, and no one is responsible for guidance in training management. Dormitory order is especially disordered. The above aspects should be effectively rectified and improved. (4) The school's affiliated senior vocational school has achieved results. However, the physics and chemistry equipment and reference books are extremely simple. The mechanical and civil engineering experimental equipment is also imperfect. The Ministry increased the school's budget last year, which was designated to enrich the vocational school. This funding should be used to add equipment to facilitate teaching and experiments. In addition, the name of the affiliated school should be prefixed with the words "Industrial" to comply with the regulations. Except for the part about the medical school, which will be ordered to be complied with after a detailed review of the report, it is hereby ordered that the school strictly comply with and report.</p>

<h3 id="e207">After the Ministry of Education's Commissioners Arrived in Beiping, They Inspected Xiehe and Beida Medical Colleges in Detail, Investigating the Equipment Situation of Various Departments <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Ministry of Education is determined to rectify the various universities and colleges in North China, making reforms based on actual circumstances. Special inspection commissioners Xie Shuying, Zhu Zhanggeng, Sun Guofeng, and Li Xien have been dispatched to Beiping for inspection. Work began on the 25th, first inspecting medical schools, followed by other vocational schools and universities. The situations of various parties are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Purpose of this Year's Inspection The purpose of this inspection by the Ministry of Education's commissioners is to review the progress of improving the instructions in the Ministry of Education's instructions to rectify various schools last year. Therefore, this inspection is not of an ordinary nature. In addition to a general inspection, this inspection will also discuss with the authorities of various schools the points to be noted in the future. All universities and colleges in the various provinces of North China must be inspected. Inspections will be held annually in the future, with South China and North China being held in two phases. The first phase will inspect higher education in South China, and the second semester will inspect higher education in North China.</p>
<p>Scheduled Inspection Itinerary The special inspection itinerary is scheduled for two months. They departed from Beijing on the 21st, arrived in Jinan on the 22nd, and inspected Qilu University and Medical School. They left Jinan on the 23rd, arrived in Beiping on the 24th, and began inspecting various schools in Beiping on the 25th. After staying in Beiping for three weeks to complete the inspection of various schools, they will go to Tianjin for inspection, and then return to Beiping, traveling south along the Pingjin Line. They will successively inspect Baoding, Kaifeng, Hankou, Anhui, and other places, and return to Beijing in May. Because the Shanghai area must be inspected in June, they must return to Beijing in May. This inspection is more complicated and the date is slightly shorter, so in terms of social interaction, apart from talking with the principals or deans of various schools, there is no time to take care of the rest.</p>
<p>Inspection of Xiehe Hospital Xie Shuying and others went to Xiehe Medical College for inspection at 9:00 AM on the 25th. After arriving at the college, they were received by Dean Gu Lin, Vice President Wang Gongshi, and others. After a short break, they were guided by Gu Lin to inspect the teaching affairs, starting from the Department of Anatomy and successively inspecting the departments of Biology, Physiology, Bacteriology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Ear, Nose, Throat, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Brain, Dentistry, X-Ray, Public Health, Dermatology, etc. They reviewed the equipment in detail. By 11:00 AM, the teaching affairs had been completely inspected. At 12:00 noon, Dean Gu Lin hosted a banquet to entertain them. At 2:00 PM, they continued to inspect the hospital's social service department, physical therapy institute, pharmacy, special wards, library, drawing room, and the statistics, bookkeeping, and income and expenditure of the General Affairs Office. The inspection was completed at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Inspection of Beida Medical College Ministry of Education inspection commissioners Xie Shuying, Sun Guofeng, Zhu Zhanggeng, and Li Xien went to the Medical College of Peking University outside Hepingmen Housun Park at 8:00 AM today (26th). Dean Wu Xiangfeng and Secretary Ma Zhidao received them. After learning the news, Peking University President Dui Songming also rushed to the scene by car to take care of everything. After a brief conversation, the inspection of teaching affairs began, starting from the Department of Biology and successively inspecting the departments of Physiology, Pharmacology, Bacteriology, Internal and External Medicine, Anatomy, Chemistry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, etc. They asked in detail about equipment and teaching methods. Whenever they arrived at a department, the chief doctor was responsible for answering. By 10:00 AM, the inspection of the classrooms was completed. Then, they inspected the accounting, general affairs registration, and other administrative aspects. At 11:30 AM, accompanied by Xu and Wu, they went to the Public Health Office affiliated to the college in Xidan Hongmiao for inspection. At 12:00 noon, they went to the affiliated hospital of the college in Xidan Jieyin Hutong for lunch. During the meal, the commissioners asked in detail about the recent situation of the college and stated the points that the Ministry of Education had pointed out that should be noted in the future. After a short break after the meal, they continued to inspect the diagnosis and treatment of various departments of the affiliated hospital at 2:00 PM, including Internal and External Medicine, Pediatrics, Ear, Nose, Throat, Ophthalmology, Dermatology, Venereal Diseases, X-Ray, Physical Therapy, Nursing and Midwifery Training, and inspected the equipment, lighting, special wards, general wards, sanatorium wards, infectious disease wards, and the like. Because the inspection was more detailed, it did not end until 5:30 PM. They returned to the Central Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Review of Zhongyuan College's Science Department The Ministry of Education's commissioners paid special attention to many points in this inspection of various schools. For example, if a certain problem had occurred or a request had been submitted to the Ministry of Education, it was included in this inspection. The private Zhongyuan College was originally China University, but was later changed to a college due to the lack of science department equipment. In recent years, through the efforts of President Wang Zhengting, a science department has been added, and the college has applied to the Ministry of Education for permission to restore the university. The Ministry of Education had previously sent commissioners Liu Shuqi, Ye Qisun, Chen Zhen, and others to inspect the college's science department equipment, but because the equipment was still insufficient, permission was not granted. Recently, after another reorganization, the college has again applied to restore the university. The Ministry of Education's commissioners will conduct a second inspection of the college's science department.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Shanghai City Literacy Education Committee Begins Operations; Literacy Methods Divided into Two Types; Jiangwan Designated as Experimental Zone <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Literacy Education Committee, since its establishment in the Municipal Government on the 1st of this month, has been actively working under the supervision of Director-General Tao Baichuan. The general office is currently located in the Municipal Zhengzhong Elementary School in the city center. Tao views this literacy education initiative as a pioneering undertaking requiring careful planning. His previous position as Chief of the Military Law Department of the Headquarters cannot be sustained concurrently, and he has already submitted his resignation to focus on this work. However, it is reported that Commander Wu has urged him to stay, granting him a short leave of absence temporarily. The current situation of the committee is explored below.</p>
<p>Key Planning Points The literacy education plan established by the committee targets the more than 500,000 illiterate citizens of this city. The methods have been revised and divided into two types: one is attending school for supplementary study, and the other is off-campus supplementary study. Regarding the first method, the committee plans to establish 300 literacy schools, each with one class, each class meeting six times, and each session lasting one hour. The municipal government will compel illiterate citizens to attend school for one hour daily for two months to graduate. If each school enrolls 50 people per session, one school can accommodate 200 people per month, and 300 schools can accommodate 60,000 people. If six sessions are held per year, the total enrollment can reach 540,000 people. The committee plans to conduct on-site surveys to compile a list of those unable to attend school for supplementary study. The second method, off-campus supplementary study, will be used. The committee will introduce Kuomintang party members, government officials, school teachers, or older students to provide individual guidance, and the committee will convene regular examinations. The committee has also designated Jiangwan as a pilot area and has appointed Jiang Wenbao, a specialist from the Municipal Education Bureau, as the director of the pilot area, it is said.</p>
<p>Major Schedule The general office of the committee has set April to June as the preparation period. A schedule of major events during the preparation period has been drafted, including: April 1st, the establishment of the committee, passing of important regulations, and the appointment of the Director-General and Deputy Director-General; April 4th, the Director-General and Deputy Director-General begin work, request the assignment of staff from the committee chairman, and establish the office; April 6th, the Jiangwan pilot area office is established; April 12th, surveys in the pilot area begin, along with widespread publicity; April 15th, literacy textbooks are sent for printing; April 21st, surveys in the pilot area conclude; April 22nd, preparations for the opening of literacy schools in the pilot area begin; April 28th, literacy textbooks are published; May 1st, literacy schools in the pilot area open, and offices in other districts are established; May 8th, surveys in other districts begin, along with expanded publicity; May 15th, enrollment for the literacy school teacher training institute begins; May 20th, entrance examinations for the training institute begin; May 21st, entrance examinations for the training institute conclude, and results are announced that evening; May 23rd, the training institute opens; May 31st, surveys in other districts conclude; June 23rd, the training institute concludes, and graduates are assigned to serve in various districts; June 24th, preparations for the opening of literacy schools in other districts begin; July 1st, the first session of literacy schools in other districts opens.</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday was still mediocre, with limited transactions. Retail investors re-emerged, but large investors mostly watched, leading to rises and then falls, with a fluctuating trend and a sense of uncertainty. The overall day was quite leisurely. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw a shrinking British pound and a rising US dollar. After the major players closed their positions, there were rumors of transactions above the listed price of 0.0625. Forward silver prices saw both rises and falls. London gold fell by 1 shilling and 4.5 pence. Although the exchange rate rose, confidence remained uncertain. Pre-market trading opened at $74.50, later retreating to within $3. The Central Bank announced its rates, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar up by 25. Customs gold units fell by 1.7 cents, and the gold standard price retreated to $901.10. The morning opened with a lower price, but failed to fall further, and sentiment began to reverse. Large investors jointly purchased, and banks also cooperated, immediately causing a rebound. It was anticipated that HSBC would announce the British pound unchanged and the US dollar up by 25, taking the opportunity to supply at a high price, gradually causing a setback. Banks seized the opportunity to sell, causing a temporary decline, but transactions were normal. The situation became dull after the low, hovering indecisively. Later, Sassoon stepped in to replenish shillings, boosting buying interest and gradually pulling the price up. After this, there was a slight pullback, but retail investor sentiment turned positive, and selling pressure was not significant, allowing buyers to operate. The price rose further at noon, but weakened slightly after the close. The after-market opened flat and weak, and trading was sluggish, with the market extremely stable. Although the Central Bank supplied gold, banks and Sassoon continued to maintain it, leading to a lack of momentum for decline and obstruction of rises, with a stable sentiment seeking supply and merely hovering. The situation was extremely leisurely. After entering the market, most floating bulls saw little hope of achieving their goals, their intentions wavered, and they closed their positions one after another. With large investors watching from the sidelines, there was a lack of support, causing selling pressure to permeate and the trend to suddenly dim. The decline was quite strong, but buyers took advantage of the low prices to operate, and the price was pulled up immediately, eventually stabilizing. The market situation of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $873, a further drop of $1.80 from the previous close. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongzhentai, Fuxing, and Yongyuan all entered the market.

Fuxing, Yongtong, Taichang, and Hengyu took advantage of the high prices to sell at $6. Huabi came out with July shillings at half a penny. Hengyu, Changda, Dafa, and Yonggeng sold at $4.20. Yuanmao and Yong took advantage of the low prices to maintain, while Dadecheng sold, retreating from $5.20 to $4.20. Xingye came out with June US dollars at half a yuan. Yuqing, Yongfuxing, Yongwanxing took advantage of the low prices to re-enter at $5.20. Yongli and others still supplied, soon dropping to $4.20.

Hengyu bought strips, rising to $7.20. At this time, transactions were sparse and the market was quiet. Huixiang, Zhengchang, Hengyu, and Jiatai sold, dropping to $5.60. After entering the market, the Indian silver telegraph reported a work stoppage. Yifeng, Yongfuxing, Yongchunyuan, Yongtong, Taichang, and Jiarun bought in one after another. Although Shunmao and Yongli sold, the price gradually rose to $6.70. Fuxing and Fuyu took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the price declined under hovering. Jinlong, Dadecheng, Deli, Jiatai, Huixiang, Dakang, Tongyu, and Run successively sold. With large investors watching from the sidelines, selling pressure suddenly intensified, falling to $1.50. Yuqing, Yongwanxing, Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu Dacheng, and Yifeng Yong took advantage of the low prices to replenish, rising to $3.50. The close was $873.40. After the close, Tianchengxiang and other retail investors sold again, retreating to within $3. Dadecheng came in to support. It was found that the highest price of the day was $878.90, and the lowest price was $871.50, with a fluctuation of $7.40. As a result, it fell $1.40 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's gold standard price, which was lowered to $901.10. In terms of the closing price, it was about $28 short, less than $7 short from the previous close. The registration price for this month was $875, and for May it was $878.

Sassoon continued to buy at noon, and the sentiment of Chinese merchants improved, with the process tightening. However, transactions were sluggish. The after-market opened flat again, and banks bought and sold unevenly, with the market hovering. Although the Central Bank sold, banks and Sassoon still absorbed it, providing consistent support.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rose yesterday (the 4th) because traders expected that Mr. Liebing's proposal to ban public utility securities companies would be leniently amended. Utility stocks rebounded strongly, leading the market higher. The decline in gold mining stocks may be due to the weakness of currencies in gold standard countries. The sharp fall in Dutch currency has revived talk that the gold group is about to disintegrate. The bond market was mixed, with high-grade bonds remaining firm. Stocks on the small exchange tended to move upstream. Wall Street paid close attention to miscellaneous grains. The grain market rose today, reportedly due to European purchases to prevent unforeseen fluctuations in the currencies of gold group countries. The total daily trading volume was 560,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>3rd  4th  Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 100.39 101.13 Up 0.17</p>

<p>The yarn market is quiet. Since the Qingming Festival holiday is from tomorrow for two days and business will resume as usual on the 9th, both long and short positions are refraining from action to avoid risk. Many empty orders were auctioned in the afternoon, but spot yarn business suddenly turned silent.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Quiet. The market opened with flat prices for all months before the auction. However, market sentiment was influenced by brisk spot yarn transactions, slightly reduced inventory at various factories, and the control of large players. As a result, the market was dry, and the general opinion was not bearish on cotton yarn for the time being, but new buyers also lacked interest. The market lacked excitement. As a result, prices for each month fell by 3.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere was particularly loose when it opened in the afternoon. There was a great lack of trading in the market, and several blackboards were opened, but the customer business became more stagnant. As a result, prices for each month fell by 1.2.3 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Ruida sold 850 bales, Daji 300 bales, Yida 300 bales, Taichang 200 bales, and Dachangcheng 200 bales. Dafeng bought 950 bales, Tongfeng 350 bales, Yuanyi 400 bales, Changfeng 950 bales, and Yongchang 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is relatively firm. Because the price of Indian cotton for April and May deliveries has risen continuously, and US cotton is stable, sentiment is slightly firm. However, spot cotton transactions are still sluggish. The needs of various factories are not smooth, and there is a high inventory of cotton. Short positions have no intention of covering, but long positions are not releasing the recent months due to the unsmooth delivery.</p>
<p>Zheng Auction Stable. The auction cotton market opened, and each month saw a slight increase. The price of Indian cotton for April and May deliveries, the price of white rough cotton also rose by 4 rupees and 25. US cotton was also quiet, and the gold price did not change. There was slight hedging by floaters in the market, so the market price was firm. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day, but this month fell by 1 jiao and a half. The market was still tight in the afternoon, and buying interest was stronger. It was heard that the dark market for Indian cotton was good, and the price of third-grade cotton also tended to be higher, so sellers reduced, and the market situation turned tight. However, it fell back suddenly at the close, and people's interest was slightly relaxed. As a result, this month rose by 1 jiao compared with the morning closing price, and the distant months remained unchanged by 5 fen. It was found that Tongji sold 1,000 loads, Jinchang 1,000 dan, Dafeng 700 dan, Ruida 700 dan, Weiyu 1,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 dan, Changhe 1,000 dan, Taichang 800 dan, and Shengyuan 900 dan.

<p>The US cotton market opened yesterday, and buying interest was stronger due to good news from Liverpool. Prices for each month rose by 7 to 11 pounds. Later, the market price fell sharply due to sales in New Orleans. There were not many sellers in the afternoon, and short positions were successively covered, rising again. As a result, old cotton did not move, and new cotton rose by 4 to 8 pounds. Spot goods did not move. British cotton was active due to better buying interest. Spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 12 points. Indian cotton first rose due to short covering and European exporters adjusting their hedge periods, but then returned due to sales by a few Japanese merchants. Pingguoer fell by half a rupee, Aomula rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 4 to 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (3rd telegram).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of each helper in Shanghai South suddenly surged, totaling nearly 50 numbers (nearly 10,000 stone in total), and the sales market was stagnant for both wholesale and retail. Only the Weihaiwei helper moved about 500 bags, so the overall situation became one of oversupply, and the market color showed a downward trend. As a result, each thick japonica rice fell by 2 jiao, and thin indica rice depreciated by 3 jiao. The decline was even more severe among those who closed, plummeting by 4 jiao, and Yinbian Yuan and Xie fell by 2 or 3 jiao respectively. There were two or three incoming boats from the various routes of He Xia in Shanghai North. Sales in the market were sluggish for various types, and the market price was slightly lower for high-grade secondary goods of white japonica rice, and the price of middle-grade goods was slightly lower by 2 jiao, and Yangdu pointed rice was slightly lower by 1 jiao. The stock of white yuan was still large, and sales were very stagnant, with a slightly lower price of 1 or 2 jiao. The rest of the goods also showed weakness.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, there was talk of a rebound of two dimes in the price of Dutch refined sugar, so sentiment gradually stabilized. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company tendered a batch of Guangdong crude white sugar, totaling 2,880 bags, including: (1) 1,780 bags of high-quality sugar, priced at $17.40, a slight increase of one dime, and all sold; (2) 1,100 bags of slightly lower-grade sugar, priced at $17.30, with 200 bags sold.

<p>Since the price of Sichuan pickled mustard tubers has fallen, the market has remained sluggish. This is because sales have not been smooth. In addition, with a bumper harvest of new crops, it is difficult for prices to rise. Yesterday, high-grade new pickled mustard tubers were quoted at $18.50, a decrease of about one dollar from before. Ordinary old goods were priced at $11-$12, with few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Metals: Severe Shortage of British Tinplate Inventory <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of British tinplate eased, many local merchants have purchased it. As a result, current arrivals are very robust. However, the price of this product is much cheaper than American, German, and Italian products. Therefore, those dealing in it find it easy to sell, so sales are quite considerable. It is estimated that since the Lunar New Year, over 7,000 boxes have been sold. As a result, the amount of inventory in the market has become scarce, and customers and factories still need to buy it, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Consequently, standard prices have soared, with the estimated price per box reaching $14.25 (90 lbs), an increase of 50 cents from before. The price for 100 lbs is $15.50, also up 40 cents. It is said that over 400 boxes were offered in the market yesterday, purchased by Fujian and Shandong merchants. Can manufacturers and printing factories are also preparing.</p>

<p>After the price of white tung oil rose and then fell in Hankou, foreign firms' transactions became even quieter. Thus, at the beginning of this week, each batch was still at $39, but foreign regulations then lowered it to $38. According to a telegram received yesterday from Hankou, the price has continued to fall from $37 to $36, and is now at $35. The downward trend is clear, in stark contrast to the soaring prices of the previous week. However, tung oil in Hankou's foreign firms has long been manipulated by foreign firms, and those engaged in this business often use tactics to push prices up and down. Those who do not understand the inside story are easily trapped by their tricks. Therefore, when there is a sharp fall, reactions are easily exaggerated. Now that prices are plummeting, we must pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Investigation of Japanese Ban on Plant Imports <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>To prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect pests from other countries and protect their own agriculture, many European and American countries have various prohibitions and inspection procedures. Some even use these measures to compensate for the inadequacy of tariff barriers and exclude agricultural imports from other countries. Japan also promulgated the Import and Export Plant Control Law on January 1, Showa 9 (1934), implementing inspection and control of imported plants. Looking around the world, there are few countries that have not implemented plant disease and insect pest inspections.

<h3 id="e247">Skip Distance in Shortwave Communication <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Chongling</p>
<p>Shortwave radio communication, with its ability to achieve long-distance communication with low power, has been valued by the radio community. Moreover, because it has many advantages over longwave, shortwave communication today has a tendency to replace longwave. How can we ignore this rapidly developing shortwave communication?</p>
<p>The characteristics of shortwave propagation are very interesting. The most obvious phenomenon that shortwave communication cannot ignore is the so-called "skip distance." The propagation of shortwave depends on its high frequency. The radio waves propagating along the ground are absorbed by the ground, and the power attenuates very quickly. After only a short distance of thirty or fifty miles, it is too weak to be distinguished. Therefore, shortwave is not as good as longwave. The part that travels along the ground is not applicable except for extremely short-distance communication. Shortwave relies entirely on the part that is emitted into the sky. This part of the radio wave directly hits the Heaviside layer in the sky. Because the Heaviside layer has reflection ability, it can be reflected from the Heaviside layer to the ground. The distance reached by this reflected radio wave is quite far, so it is used for shortwave communication. However, there is a distance between the reach of the direct wave and the reach of the reflected wave from the Heaviside layer. Within this distance, the radio wave propagating along the ground has long disappeared, and the reflected radio wave has passed over it. Therefore, there is no sound. This distance is named skip distance. Therefore, if a receiver is installed within the skip distance, it will not be able to receive audio, which is a major shortcoming of shortwave communication.</p>
<p>Skip distance is deeply related to wavelength, elevation angle of radio waves, and the height and electron density of the Heaviside layer. There is a reason for the change in skip distance with wavelength, day and night, time, and season. According to the results of theory and experimentation, the following relationships have been obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Wavelength: Under the same height of the Heaviside layer, the skip distance increases as the wavelength decreases, as shown in Figure 1. According to experiments, the Heaviside layer at a height of 100 miles is expected to have no skip distance with a wavelength of 80 meters; with a wavelength of 40 meters, the skip distance is about 100 miles; with a wavelength of 20 meters, the skip distance is about 500 miles; with a wavelength of 10 meters, the skip distance increases to 1,000 to 2,000 miles. For a Heaviside layer of 225 miles high, there still seems to be no skip distance with a wavelength of 80 meters; if the wavelength is reduced to 40 meters, the skip distance is about 200 miles; 20 meters is 1,000 miles; and at a wavelength of 10 meters, the transmitted radio wave penetrates deep into the Heaviside layer and can never return to the ground. The reason why ultra-short waves cannot be used for long-distance communication is because of this. The skip distance has such a relationship with the wavelength. Therefore, there is a reason why audio of 40 meters can be received in a certain place, but audio of 36 meters wavelength emitted from the same place cannot be received. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e248">Simple Method to Increase Variable Capacitor Capacitance <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>There are many ways to increase the capacity of a variable capacitor, but the method described here is relatively the simplest and most economical. Because we know that two sets of metal plates separated by an insulator become a capacitor; the capacity of this capacitor is directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the insulator. Therefore, we can increase the capacity simply by replacing it with another insulator with a higher dielectric constant.</p>
<p>The dielectric constant of air is 1, mica is 4 to 8, wax is 2 to 2.5, porcelain is 4.4, quartz is 4.5, rosin is 2.5, shellac is 3.1, ordinary glass is 3.1 to 4, and bakelite is 5 to 6.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to increase the capacity of a 0.0001 air-insulated variable capacitor to 0.00025 Farads, then we only need to fill all the gaps between the metal plates of the capacitor with wax. If the increase is less than 0.00025, then less wax should be poured in.</p>
<p>In short, to increase the capacity a lot, use an insulator with a larger dielectric constant and fill all the gaps between the metal plates; otherwise, use an insulator with a smaller constant and only fill part of the gaps. The exact number is best determined by experimentation.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Satisfactory Single-Tube Amplifier Speaker Circuit <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>Recently, a friend asked me to install an AC amplifier speaker radio for him. I thought this was another opportunity for experimentation, so I readily agreed. Because I had heard friends say that the Megadyne circuit is very reliable, I chose the following circuit. It took a full half day to install it. I plugged in the power supply and turned it on, feeling doubtful. It really made me jump with joy. It was able to play all the large and small local radio stations in the speaker. The volume is comparable to that of an ordinary three-tube radio. As for selectivity, it is also considerable because a filter was added. I think this circuit must also be very much needed by amateur comrades, so I specially introduce it. I hope that amateur comrades will announce the results after the experiment, which would be very fortunate.</p>

<p>L 30 gauge wire wound 120 turns on a 1 1/4 inch rubber tube</p>

<h3 id="e250">Simple Method for Matching the Impedance of the Speaker Field Coil <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>The field coil of the speaker in commercial radios also serves as a filtering choke coil in the substituting B power supply. Therefore, it has a certain impedance value and cannot be changed casually, otherwise the output substituting B voltage will change and affect the operation of the radio. For this reason, sometimes the field coil is damaged, and a speaker with the same impedance cannot be found for a while, then the entire radio will have to be put aside.</p>
<p>When encountering this difficulty, the following method can be used to solve it. Just remove the original speaker and replace it with the two items shown in the attached figure. In the figure, L is a newly replaced power speaker field coil, its impedance is smaller than that of this machine; R is a 10-watt wire-wound resistor, its impedance value plus L should be equal to the impedance of the original speaker's field coil. If hum occurs after this modification, then the dotted line part in the figure should be added. C is a paper fixed capacitor with a capacity of 2 MFD, and the withstand voltage is the same as the filtering capacitor in the substitute B power supply part of this radio.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Knowledge that Beginners Should Have (1) (Continued) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xuelun</p>
<p>(3) Capacitors: Variable capacitors are often used in radios to adjust the frequency. These capacitors should be air-insulated and have a straight-line frequency. When assembling a single-tube radio, although only one variable capacitor is needed, a dual-gang or triple-gang capacitor can be purchased in advance for future expansion needs, and matched with a suitable slow-rotation dial. Do not buy inferior products for this type of capacitor, because they are easily damaged and the capacitance of the two capacitors cannot be synchronized. Although there is a compensator, it will eventually lead to problems after assembly. There is no way to remedy it except to discard and repurchase it. Therefore, be careful when purchasing. The capacity of variable capacitors is usually 0.00035 and 0.0005 MFD. The former requires a higher ratio of primary to secondary coils, so the efficiency is also higher. Fixed capacitors, except those used for filtering, should be mica-insulated to avoid losses.</p>
<p>(4) Coils: The coils mentioned in this article include high and low frequency transformers, detector coils, and high and low frequency chokes. Assuming that the radio we hope to build has one stage of high-frequency amplification, one stage of detection, and one stage of low-frequency amplification, then the high-frequency amplification and detection coils can be wound on spiderweb boards, because their efficiency is indeed higher than that of cylindrical coils. If high-frequency amplification needs to be used for two or more stages, then cylindrical coils must be used due to spatial constraints. Moreover, if the number of high-frequency amplification stages is increased, even if there is a slight loss, it will not be noticed. It is best to use silk-covered wire for self-made coils. Enameled wire can also be used, but it cannot be disassembled and modified, because once it is disassembled and modified, the insulating paint will fall off in some places, so it cannot be used. When winding coils, it is better to wind a few more turns first, and remove the excess. Otherwise, adding windings during wiring will not only damage the appearance, but also reduce efficiency. Low-frequency transformers are very important to sound quality and volume, and must be high-quality products. A ratio of 3.5:1 is the most suitable. High-frequency chokes should be purchased with segmented winding methods, such as those produced by America's Zhongyong, otherwise it is better not to use them. Low-frequency chokes must pay attention to their inductance and the current value that can pass through them, depending on their use.</p>
<p>(5) Resistors: Resistors are divided into two types: variable and fixed. In terms of materials, there are also carbon and wire-wound types. Generally, carbon is used for high resistance values, and wire-wound is used for low resistance values. Variable resistors with high resistance values are also called potentiometers, and are often used to adjust volume or control voltage. This device should also be high-quality. The fixed resistors with high resistance values are grid leaks. Their values should not be strictly adhered to the values ​​stated on the circuit diagram. Replacing and testing with 1 to 4 megohms can often yield better results. Carbon resistors with less than one megohm are mostly used for voltage reduction. Manufacturers often paint various colors on the outside to indicate their numerical values. When purchasing, pay attention to the ohm and watt values. Wire-wound variable resistors are mostly used to control filament current, and fixed ones are used for both C resistors and voltage dividers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The elderly are neighbors with the spittoon, young men are close to women, and young children are fond of leather toys. Because the objects they are fond of are different, their tastes of joy and sorrow are separated into a path of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>A person who can kill is not necessarily a bandit. Bandits killing people is very obvious. In society, there is a kind of people with human faces and animal hearts. They kill people, making it impossible to guard against. True robbers are easy to prevent, but bad people lurking in society are impossible to recognize. This is the so-called "open spears are easy to dodge, hidden arrows are hard to guard against." The number of people who die from this path in a year is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.</p>
<h3 id="e253">A Journey to Nantianshan <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Li</p>
<p>Nantianshan is located 120 li south of Qingtian County. Taoist books call it the Fourth Blessed Land, covering an area of more than 200 li. There are many plains in the middle. The mountains are steep and the water flows from flying springs. The water of the whole mountain converges from hundreds of streams and flows out from five mouths. (There is also a northeast mouth outside the east, west, south, and north mouths.) The mouths are all towering peaks, exceptionally majestic and beautiful. The waterfalls are especially spectacular, with three places over 1,000 feet high and many places over 100 feet high. Nantianxiang is located in the center of it all. Tourists can view the scenery in Nantianxiang for several days and the food and lodging are relatively comfortable. There are four ways to enter the mountain: (1) Take a boat from Qingtian City to Baiyan, which is 80 li and can be reached in one day. Hire a sedan to enter the mountain and climb the Stone Ladder Ridge from the Wanfu Mouth on the east side. It takes half a day to reach Nantianxiang, which is 50 li. (2) Hire a boat from Qingtian City to go up the Xiaoxi River to the foot of the mountain, which is 110 li. Stay overnight in the boat and cross the He Kou Ridge (one of the Nine Ridges) the next day to Wuyang Village, the hometown of Liu Wencheng, which is 20 li. It is another 10 li to Nantianxiang. Although the journey is longer, the scenery is the best. (3) Take a sedan from Qingtian City to Nantianxiang via Dalingfu, which is 120 li and can be reached in one and a half days. The journey is the shortest, but there is not much scenery along the way. (4) Take an early bus from Ruian City to Pingyangkeng, which takes 3 hours and is 70 li. Hire a sedan to go through the port to Dayu, which takes a full day and is 140 li. Then take a sedan up Dahui Ridge, which takes 3 hours. The most famous Baizhang Waterfall in Xinting Mountain is nearby. It is another 30 li to Nantianxiang. In total, there are 32 peaks in the whole mountain, with Wanren, Shipu, Kangwu, and Wuyang being the best. The most magnificent waterfall is Baizhangji, and the most ingenious is Chuanliang Waterfall. The best cave is the Water Curtain at the North Mouth. Du Mu Taihe's poem about traveling to Nantian, "Deep in the mountains in May, there are sheepskins," shows that the mountain is high and airy, making it a famous summer resort. The best time to travel to the mountain is in summer.</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Returning home from outside, putting down my lecture folder, a slender, ink-black shadow follows me, carrying a faint fragrance of Cymbidium orchids. A bit of irritability evaporated by liver qi naturally subsides. At home, my wife always loves to wear a long black silk dress, black stockings, and black leather shoes. A pair of black earrings peek out from under her feet, clinging to her white cheeks. That clear facial contour and graceful demeanor rejuvenate a body exhausted from work. However, the comfort my wife gives me is more than just these.</p>
<p>Friends say I am happy—a happily married husband. I, too, admit this. I don't have to take off my coat myself. When I sit down, a cup of tea, neither too strong nor too weak, made with pre-Qingming tea leaves, and a cigarette that I love to smoke, are personally handed to me by her. When eating, there is a plate of fried eggs and a bowl of pure vegetable soup she personally prepares. She seems to be the worm in my stomach, having the same tongue and the same mood as me. However, she is much more patient than I am. When I am angry, she sits to the side and smiles faintly.</p>
<p>"If you continue to be so docile, you'll become your husband's slave!" Someone said to her, trying to provoke her. However, she is unmoved. She remains docile in my presence. In the evening, I never see my wife go to bed and sleep before I do. Sometimes when I come home late, she'll be dozing off at my desk. I feel both ashamed and remorseful. Therefore, I often force myself to go home earlier. Isn't it true that my wife is preparing many comforting actions and words, waiting for me to accept them?</p>
<p>"I would rather be docile to a faithful husband until death," my wife once said.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When the colors were dyed and the silk was dried, the results reached a very satisfactory level. Thus, these silks were taken down one by one from the frames and wound onto wooden bobbins, usually one bobbin for each color. After winding, since they were not used for weaving silk, they could only be kept as materials for embroidery or sewing. However, so much was not needed at once, so they were stored first, to be selected and used according to the colors specified when the seamstresses needed them.</p>
<p>The description of the silk-making process can be said to be complete up to this point. Next, we will talk about the shoe-making industry in the palace. Although the shoes worn daily by women of some status in the palace were made by dedicated shoe-making artisans, the main purpose of supporting these artisans in the palace was really for the Empress Dowager alone. Therefore, the narrative here focuses on the phoenix shoes worn by the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Empress Dowager's phoenix shoes, readers should not think it is a small topic. If we were to explain it in detail from beginning to end, there would be a lot to write about! First, let's talk about the management aspect: there were two eunuchs who were specially assigned to manage the Empress Dowager's phoenix shoes all year round without doing anything else. They did not feel that this task was easy; they felt it was very important. They dared not slack off at all, and they always carefully guarded these phoenix shoes, as if they were guarding a treasure house. According to the facts, the Empress Dowager's phoenix shoes could indeed be considered a valuable treasure, because most of the phoenix shoes had extremely valuable jewels, jade, or emeralds inlaid on them, and they were by no means ordinary things.

<h3 id="e257">Critique <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ping</p>
<p>Unable to afford books, I can only go to the library. The library is a soup kitchen for poor boys (of course, the rich can go too). It is truly great compassion and boundless merit. Unexpectedly, many talented people who read books (perhaps beauties do not) especially like to write a few lines of criticism in the books. They treat the books in the library as the walls of a public toilet, commenting at will. It can be said that every sentence is wonderful and every word is clever. Here are a few excerpts for everyone to enjoy together.</p>
<p>One day, I found a book by Dewey called "The School of Tomorrow" with three lines written in fountain pen:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow: Students sit on a large platform to listen to lectures, and the teacher teaches on a small stool. The day after tomorrow: Students give the questions, and the teacher takes the test. The day after that: There are no teachers in the school."</p>
<p>I was praising, "Excellent, excellent!" Unexpectedly, there was also something written on the blank space on the side of another page:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, all universities, middle schools, and elementary schools will be co-educational. The day after tomorrow, men and women will take classes shirtless. The day after that: Men and women will take classes naked."</p>
<p>These two people each have their own merits. Also, in Kilpatrick's "Philosophy of Education," I saw: "The method of the school is nothing more than inviting celebrities to be school directors, building foreign-style school buildings, and often performing or dancing, or participating in propaganda and shouting slogans."</p>
<p>These are all facts, but I think this gentleman is wasting ink. In the Complete Works of Ryunosuke Akutagawa, someone wrote a poem: "Kikuchi's fame is passed down after death, Natsume cherished his talent in those years. Since Kappa became a final echo, the daughters of Tokyo have lingering grief." And on a volume of "Sha Ran" someone wrote: "I can write human joys and sorrows, but I am ashamed that my talent is not as unrestrained. Hearing the roar of the snow mountain lion, I read strange books with blood on my skull." Both poems are excellent and written in the same handwriting; the writing is also very charming.</p>
<p>In Andreev's "The Seven Who Were Hanged," there are also two very funny sentences. One line is: "Pitiful. Even my sister-in-law became eight!" Another line notes: "My sister-in-law has big eyes and a thin neck, just like a hanged ghost."</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that in "Abelard and Heloise's Letters," someone wrote: "What's so strange about monks and nuns getting along? We in China have had it for a long time!" Reading it, one can't help but laugh.</p>

<p>Eating Western food (the common name for Western cuisine) is like tasting exotic flavors, and is often equated with riding in cars and living in foreign houses. Living a Europeanized life, isn't it enjoyable! However, there are those who are not familiar with its customs, and often cause ridicule among the elegant (also written as "爷," similar in meaning to "freehand style"). Although this is a trivial matter, there are some points that should be warned. Those who are familiar with it and do not lose their etiquette are the so-called gentlemen. Otherwise, if you eat Western food with the intention of having fun, and make a joke with nowhere to seek justice, is it worth it? I still remember when I was a child, I received instructions from Ms. Highland of the United States, and recorded the following points based on the common mistakes, and added my own opinions:—</p>
<p>Do not talk much when eating. — This is the same meaning as Confucius's legacy "Don't speak when eating" in our country, which shows that many things in China and foreign countries, ancient and modern, have similarities. The intention is probably: If you talk during a meal, you will force the people at the same table to listen and respond perfunctorily, which will interfere with eating — this is a kind of tyranny! Also, talking during a meal inevitably changes the normal state of eating, such as neglecting chewing, speeding up swallowing, reducing the amount of food, etc., which ultimately affects human health. However, there are often impromptu speeches at large banquets now, which can often give the audience at the same table more than they lose, so let's discuss it separately.</p>
<p>Do not bend your neck to eat from the plate. — Only beasts eat by bringing their mouths to the food. The reason why there are stiff collars in the clothes of the two people is probably to maintain the posture of keeping the neck straight.</p>
<p>Do not put the tip of the knife into your mouth. — The comedy of a country bumpkin cutting his tongue while eating Western food is because the barbarian did not pay attention to this commandment.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to strike the knife and fork against each other, or to make a sound by striking the utensils. — Although this sound has the beauty of music, it is not needed at the dining table. After Liu Bang of the Han Dynasty gained the world, he only granted his nephew the title of Marquis of Jie Geng after repeated requests from his subordinates, just so as not to forget the old evil of his sister-in-law banging the spoon on the side of the pot to indicate that there was nothing left, and Feng Huan sang and sighed "No fish in one meal"; therefore, although the sound of these eating utensils may not all be to express injustice, they are often enough to cause unnecessary misunderstandings, so it is better to be quiet.</p>
<p>The sound of a knife and fork touching the bottom of the bowl, making a sound like filing copper, makes people's teeth sour and their skin crawl, and is most likely to cause disgust — this kind of tooth-grinding sound is probably unbearable for any nation, and is very annoying!</p>
<p>Do not make sounds of chewing lips or sucking tongue. — This is the ugly state of gluttony, excessively revealing his ability to ravage food, and taking pleasure in himself. There are also those who chew wantonly when eating, unconsciously making this kind of sound between his mouth and tongue, as if it is the rhythm of a proud eye sound, which makes people speculate that he cannot often get a rich meal, bringing this kind of poor appearance. This kind of eating appearance is also not allowed in China.</p>
<p>Do not make a sucking sound when eating soup — Even swarms of mosquitoes can form thunder. If everyone at the meal makes a loud sound of sucking soup, don't make people suspect that it is the sound of a surging tide?</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Night Talk of a Sad Life, Originally a Dream / Footprints Scattered, Wind and Rain Too Oppressive</p>
<p>Huanhua said, "Alas! Mr. Li, you are a well-fed person who doesn't know the hunger of the hungry. For people like us, it's already amazing if someone looks at us twice, so how dare we talk about any conditions with others? I'm just begging Mr. Jia to do a good deed and take me back to Jiangnan by the way. I have nothing to repay him with, so I'm going to be a matchmaker for him now. I think that Miss Zhu's family must have some grievances that are inconvenient to tell men. If I go and talk to her carefully and get her thoughts out, then I can know what it would take for her to be satisfied. If we can do it, we'll persuade Mr. Jia to do it. If we can't do it, we'll persuade Miss Zhu's family to let go, and wouldn't this matter be successful?" Li Shilian said, "What you said is not bad. We also thought of some things, but it's not convenient to say them to the girl. Her mother is not worth mentioning, she doesn't know anything at all. As for that Sister-in-law Hu, she wants to make a fortune from it, and she wants to talk about her price before she drops other people's affairs. It's better not to talk about this matter, the more you talk about it, the more trouble it will be. You have a way with words, I think, if you are willing to come forward, this matter will definitely be successful." Huanhua smiled and said, "How do you know that I have a way with words?" Li Shilian didn't say anything, first he nodded towards the room next door, and then he whispered, "This gentleman is extremely shrewd, ordinary people are not easy to move. But..." Huanhua waved her hands at him repeatedly, and smiled with a pursed mouth. At this time, there was already a sound from the room next door, presumably Jia Duocai had already gotten up. Li Shilian had many things to ask of Jia Duocai, so it was not convenient for him to talk here for too long, lest he offend someone, so he immediately walked out of the room lightly, and then walked towards Jia Duocai's room with a heavy pace. Afterwards, Yang Huanhua reapplied her makeup and also walked towards this side. (175)</p>

<h3 id="e260">Small Sensations of Qingming <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The spring is bright, and the Qingming Festival is coming soon. This is the best season of the year. Schools are on vacation, and the mountains and fields are dotted with people enjoying the spring. Parks are also crowded with people, and everyone has a happy energy on their faces. Spring is truly a happy season.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is sweeping tombs during Qingming. In the countryside, the fields are full of flying paper ashes. Although the people who sweep tombs are all mourning the dead, they all have a bit of joyful spring feeling on their faces. It is actually a kind of pastime used to enjoy the spring. It is not impossible to say that.</p>
<p>Speaking of sweeping tombs, I remembered the National Tomb Sweeping Day decided by the Central Government that I saw in the newspaper a few days ago. The so-called National Tomb Sweeping Day is when the Central Government sends personnel to the northwest to sweep and worship the tombs of the ancient Yellow Emperor and others, as a kind of commemoration of our forgetting the ancestors of the nation, hence the name National Tomb Sweeping Day. This is very interesting. Our national spirit has indeed declined and is on the verge of exhaustion. The country is full of foreign iron hooves and bloodstains. If we don't commemorate our national ancestors, this nation will not be far from destruction.</p>
<p>However, restoring the national spirit and national power seems to be not enough to rely solely on some spiritual commemorations and memories. It is best to take out our strength and wash away the bloodstains and wounds all over this nation, then there may be hope. In addition to the Central Government's decision to have a National Tomb Sweeping Day this time, we hope that there will be a more meaningful move for the people to strive for.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Small Scenes of Hanshi <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>Around noon, the bell of a distant temple rang out "Dang——". The faint sound drifted across the fields, over the eaves of farmhouses, and over the cemetery with scattered weeds.</p>
<p>In the cemetery, some ashes of paper money, along with the swaying of willow branches, and the ripples of the stream, flew up rhythmically, scattering the remaining fragments on some ownerless desolate tombs. The fields were silent, and one could hear the beat of one's heart, and three or two faint whispers of unknown birds in the distance.</p>
<p>As the wind passed, it brought one or two faint, lingering cries—a remembrance and recollection of the dear departed soul. From this, I seemed to hear some notes of friendship and memory between people; perhaps it was a young widow remaining in the world, remembering the dreamlike past love, and now, she could only fall in a pile of grass in front of the tomb, searching for the cherry-colored smile of that year in sobbing tears? Perhaps it was; the younger generation, at the moment of losing the courage and meaning of survival, walked in front of the deceased elders to remember the appearance and feelings of this dead generation, and in the tears of an orphan that no one can accept, to recall the peaceful medieval mood? Or perhaps it was some people with greater, more meaningful ideals, who, in the advancing spring, chose this day more suitable for remembrance, bringing blood-colored flowers to dedicate to this friend who threw himself into the light, but was finally eroded by boundless darkness, while at the same time, in tears, reckoning some great, terrible past sufferings that are not suitable for people to know, and predicting those future, unimaginable storms? But, who knows? The relationship between people is mysterious, infinite, and far-reaching beyond measure! When people are alive, they play all kinds of postures of life as much as possible according to their own ways, and when one day they complete the task of the drama of life, and suddenly drill into the cemetery that serves as the backstage of the natural world, all actions have formed one ten-thousandth of history, and all friendships? They can only be found in the low and distant crying in the silent cemetery in a dark spring day.</p>
<p>Could it be said that: is this thousands of sobs that floats in the cemetery during the Cold Food Festival also a kind of glory in the world?</p>
<p>(From some unknown place, a cuckoo cried out once or twice, and a drizzle was falling in the fields.</p>
<p>I really want to ask: where is there a wine shop with an apricot-yellow flag, using the true laughter of the human world to treat people?)</p>
<p>The mud road gradually became wet, and people felt an unpleasant feeling of mud when they stepped on it. By the stream, the willow branches silently brushed the water surface, and peach blossoms also jumped into the water like stars. People on their way, with an anxious and hurried heart, hurried across the sticky dirt road, looking at the sky. Grey, low-hanging, dull and suffocating! So he reached out to brush off the rain falling on his body, and grumbled unhappily to himself: "Damn, I didn't bring an umbrella, I didn't bring rain shoes or oilskin, such a good day, it rained for no reason, who would have thought of it! Who would have thought of it? Strange!</p>
<p>On the dirt road, wheelbarrows were walking sparsely, the wheels intermittently making a scattered, unpleasant, ear-piercing sound. People who swept tombs returned with a desolate mood, and middle-aged servants carried the leftover food and sacrificial utensils, following silently. It was already the time when the sun was resting on the west mountain, and dusk gradually rose, covering the entire drizzling field. Somewhere, crows were cawing in the evening.</p>
<p>Another windy and rainy Cold Food Festival sank into the setting sun.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Streamlined Life <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>People living in this brand new and rotten 1935, even their lifestyles have been changed to streamlined——isn't that right? These days, everyone is like that: living today without knowing tomorrow——maybe today they are still walking on a very flat road, and tomorrow they will be thrown into the deep valley of life; but, who dares to think about the perspective of "tomorrow's" life anymore——that's stupid. Because, maybe tomorrow is already...?</p>
<p>(The streets of the big metropolis in the morning have a crowded "Rush bour" to the office. Cars and people, like the early tide of the Yellow Sea, flow in the same direction. People's minds are filled with: the news headlines on the morning newspaper, the real faces of the foreign managers in the foreign firm, the numbers in the ledger, the "number" for salary, the calculation of the months of arrears: January, February...</p>
<p>The tram rings its bell constantly like a death knell, crawling slowly like a snake. The carriages are crowded, and people are packed into boxes like sardines. It's hot, and full of uncomfortable human atmosphere, suffocating and dizzying.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>When the car stopped for the Xth time in front of the red light of the traffic light, you could hear the voice of or someone talking in the third-class carriage:</p>
<p>——In short, I say, things are not good this year; living this year is like fighting guerrillas, called: living one day is one day; otherwise, who can calculate the fate of tomorrow? ——Silenced, an uncomfortable feeling stirred in my heart: At this time yesterday, I was still sitting in the car going to the foreign firm to sign in, and who would have thought that by noon, the four words "cost savings" would break my rice bowl under the qualification of twelve years——this is simply a dream, a dream! A dream that no one would believe! But the fact is unmistakable——wasn't I no longer taking the car to the office today, but instead going to find someone to "help"?</p>
<p>——This nightmare-like, streamlined life ah)</p>
<p>Many people, countless people, put on 1935-style coats, hurrying, running, and carefully running on the tight string of this streamlined era: in between, there is the wolf-like ambition and the rabbit's cunning of the enterprise, and the result is sinking into the sorrow of decline. The small clerks are running desperately on the track of life with a wet heart, selling their labor day by day and filling their stomachs half full under the pickaxe. The clerks are dizzy by the keyboard of the typewriter, and the politicians train the patients to be as beautiful and fluent as Kroemi's furniture. So: the streamlined beauty of 1935 appears in people's cries, people's laughter, and people's planning. The new era is streamlined, people live in the middle, people are happy, people are sad, people are drunk in the dimples of sleeping pills.</p>
<p>(Reflecting, the bankrupt department store owner puts a bottle of sleeping pills in his pocket, and in the loud jazz music, fixes his eyes on the enchanting body of the dancer Annie, greedily spitting words into her ear——</p>
<p>"Annie, you are so beautiful, your body is streamlined——"</p>
<p>"Ha, you said that tonight, but tomorrow night you probably won't even pay attention to people, right? You are this person—"</p>
<p>"Annie, you are so smart." (But, tomorrow, who knows tomorrow?) Reaching into his pocket, touching the bottle of sleeping pills, his heart seemed to fall into an ice cellar.)</p>
<p>The newspaper reported: "1935 streamlined new car arrives in Shanghai, reducing air resistance by 13%, speed: 75 miles per hour!"</p>
<p>——These days, even people's lives are streamlined ah.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Is It Okay to Marry a Prostitute? <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young clerk in a shop, already twenty-two years old. I am not yet married. My family is in the countryside, and I am alone in Shanghai, so in my spare time, I am very free. Who knew that this freedom would cause my current problem!</p>
<p>Not long ago, due to the temptations of the environment and various stimuli, I ended up on the path of seeking pleasure. Soon, I met a prostitute. She has a gentle temperament and none of the licentious habits of prostitutes. I love her very much, and she sees my honesty. At the same time, knowing that she has fallen into this pit of fire and has little hope of getting out, for the sake of her lifelong happiness, she expressed her willingness to marry me. I understand everything about her and feel that she is a hardworking woman. So, driven by our emotions, we made a lifelong promise. Although we have privately agreed to marry, many problems have followed, making me feel doubtful and uncertain. I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>(1) This matter has not been approved by my parents. If they find out she is a prostitute, they will definitely encounter strong opposition. If relatives and friends know, they will certainly disapprove, which may affect my position.</p>
<p>(2) She has been a prostitute for more than two years. Will this affect her ability to have children in the future?</p>
<p>(3) According to my current financial situation, I cannot afford the cost of marriage. However, she is willing to endure another year of hardship to save some money, which can reduce my burden. But is this method feasible?</p>
<p>(4) If I break up with her, how can the wounds on my soul be healed?</p>
<p>Sir, because of these problems, I am hesitant. I wonder if you would give me a clear indication? Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, Gao Xueqing</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In the minds of most people, prostitutes are considered the most lowly people because they can lead young men who venture into brothels to ruin, causing them to lose their fortunes and reputations. They seem to be an "inauspicious object." But this sin is not caused by prostitutes themselves. They are products of an abnormal society. They are pitiful creatures under economic oppression. We should sympathize with them. However, due to traditional concepts deeply rooted in people's hearts, people generally despise them.</p>
<p>Patronizing prostitutes is originally an act of self-degradation and is not worthy of emulation. But now, if one can repent and want to find someone to entrust their dissipated soul to, it may be the first step towards turning back. Therefore, although we do not rashly approve of marrying a prostitute, it is possible under special circumstances.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao said in his letter that his current financial situation cannot afford the cost of marriage. Then, where did the money for his past indulgence come from? Is it a misappropriation of public funds? (Although this cannot be confirmed, such behavior is inevitable when one is lost.) If so, he should immediately economize on his own expenses and try to make amends, so as not to be discovered later, which would leave him with nowhere to stand.</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss his four questions. The first question: a passive approach is to first redeem her. If she has family or relatives, she can temporarily stay with her relatives, and then go through formal marriage procedures. Besides, prostitutes and good women do not have obvious differences, and it will not be revealed for a while. Once the deed is done, the parents will not say anything. But from a positive perspective, as long as you have the ability to be independent in marriage and make a living, as long as she can consistently love you after marrying you, you don't have to care about other people's contempt and attacks. The second question: a doctor should be consulted immediately for an assessment. At the same time, her behavior should also be carefully observed to avoid harming future happiness. The third question is absolutely not feasible. Because a prostitute's life is like being in a pit of fire, how can you save someone from water and fire by delaying it? Moreover, "one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." In such a bad environment, her character is also often in danger of changing. As for economic difficulties, there is only the method of economizing, but since you see her as a hardworking woman, it may not be a problem.</p>
<p>As for the last question, it is fundamentally contradictory. We believe that if you have considered it and think it is worth marrying, then why talk about breaking up? If you think it is not worth marrying, then you have fundamentally lost the foundation of love, and even if you break up, there will be no pain.</p>
<p>Correction: There were many typographical errors in the handwritten manuscript published last Thursday. For example, "穀" was mistyped as "槖". "　" and "県" should be swapped. "鴻" should be changed to "鸿", "誠" to "诚", and so on.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's illustration "迷亡" was a mistake for "逃"亡, we hereby correct it.</p>

<p>Yu Fu Assassinating Duke Yin (Continued)</p>
<p>The word "將" (will) is Duke Yin's greedy and cherish heart. It is a form of expression. It should be given immediately. Why is there a will to give? To plan a speculative opportunity? Hearing is immediate. How can there be a "will"? This is why it provoked Yu Fu's humiliation and aroused Duke Yin's suspicion, and ultimately led to his death. Alas, Duke Yin's righteousness of relinquishing the country, his heart is so clear, his deeds are so obvious. Even the slightest fault cannot be tolerated, and he suffered a great disaster. Moreover, those whose hearts and deeds are not as visible as Duke Yin's, how dare they not strive to do better? Therefore, the gentleman's pursuit of righteousness continues day and night, daring not to use his utmost efforts. It is not only to be familiar with righteousness but also to avoid disaster. Without the disaster of Duke Yin, pursuing it means that those who do righteousness are satisfied with establishing one virtue and cultivating one behavior. They are impatient and do not move forward. Therefore, it is said, "Encouraging the world to have a heart for righteousness is the assassination of Duke Yin."</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(13) Audience Reactions to Sound Films</p>
<p>When sound films were first invented, there was a wave of heated resistance among the audience. All they heard was a harsh, grating sound. Therefore, they felt that this new thing was too noisy, depriving them of the quiet enjoyment they had in the movie theater. In addition, there were many things they were unaccustomed to seeing and hearing. For example, their favorite big star, Conrad Nagel, suddenly started talking in a halting manner on the screen. And the sound of his voice seemed to come from his vest pocket. This made them feel involuntarily annoyed. We must know that when sound films were first invented, Conrad Nagel was one of the few actors who could speak correctly. Everyone was vying to hire them, but because of the imperfection of the machinery, their accents were messed up.</p>
<p>The earliest sound films were mostly short comedies, and some were newsreels. The actors in the short comedies were mostly vaudeville actors from the stage. But soon after, they added dialogue to the silent films. That kind of dialogue could make you jump out of your seat. Many actors you thought were very quiet and elegant suddenly shouted and clamored on the screen. And their voices were not meant to be melodious but went up and down, making people impatient.</p>
<p>Many conservative theater managers, after watching these early sound films, believed that this kind of thing was just a temporary fad and would not last long. They were unwilling to spend money to rent sound films, but they saw that the number of people in their own theaters was small, while the number of moviegoers in the theaters across the street was increasing day by day. Soon, they gradually followed others and adopted sound films.</p>
<p>As for Hollywood, it was originally a place most sensitive to light, so within a few months after the invention of sound films, there was a very violent disturbance. Hollywood's material concepts had completely changed. The noisy silent film studios had been dismantled. Great, quiet, sound-isolated sound stages were built.</p>
<p>We must know that silent film studios were never "silent." All the staff, from the director, lighting technicians, set designers, etc., were constantly talking loudly. But in the era of sound films, they could no longer "sound" off because the sound of a needle dropping on the ground would be as loud as a gunshot when recorded in the film.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a peak era of musical films. Hollywood's tycoons scoured for songwriting talents everywhere, but they soon realized that musical films were being overdone, and many songwriters lost their jobs and returned home. But among the actors, an outstanding talent rose at that time, which was also a romance in film history, an accidental occurrence. We probably still haven't forgotten the first sound and dance mega-production "The Jazz Singer." When Warner bought that script, preparing for their groundbreaking move, the actor in their mind was originally George Jessel. But when they discussed and signed the contract with George Jessel, negotiations broke down due to disagreements on the terms. The Warner Company then gave that contract to Al Jolson, a singer on Broadway in New York, a frustrated performer in decline.</p>
<p>After "The Jazz Singer" was released, Al Jolson jumped to become a hero created by the times. He was the most popular person of the era. He was the only hope for the future of sound films. He caused an unprecedented sensation, which was rare thereafter. He established special merits in a certain position. That is, he gave the makers of sound films a powerful stimulant and provided considerable consolation and encouragement to all those involved in the invention, advancement, and completion of sound films.

<h3 id="e270">Review of "David Copperfield" <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>David Copperfield</p>
<p>——Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>People are probably already shocked by the fame of Charles Dickens, and they know a lot about everything about him, so it seems unnecessary to introduce him again here. Taking a step back, from films such as "A Tale of Two Cities" or "Oliver Twist," audiences have long been deeply familiar with their style. Therefore, regarding "David Copperfield" on film, I only want to talk about some aspects of the technical presentation.</p>
<p>People usually say that it is not easy to express a novel of hundreds of thousands of words on more than ten thousand feet of film. In terms of capacity, it is obviously very difficult. Therefore, general literary films cannot but cut out some of the unimportant parts of the novel, otherwise, it can only be verbose and piled up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, novels can have exquisite psychological descriptions. This delicate psychological portrayal is something that drama and film cannot achieve, and it becomes a unique function of novels. Therefore, when adapting a novel into a film, one must try to express the inner descriptions outwardly, but this is very laborious work. — This illustrates that film has its unique skills. It breaks through the categories of time and space in drama. It must concretely convey all abstract words with images, so that the appreciators can obtain a more direct response.</p>
<p>In these areas, the author of "David Copperfield" can be said to have done it completely. This is excellent in all aspects of screenwriting, directing, acting, ... and is entirely expressed in terms of film art. In order to illustrate these points, I would like to cite a few examples as concrete proof.</p>
<p>(1) Little David playing at the fisherman's house. He and a little girlfriend are on the beach. The little girl said, "If I become a noblewoman, I will buy Uncle Bundy (the fisherman) a big blue coat, and that coat will be full of jewels." This dialogue shows that she harbors great extravagance. (This serves as a foreshadowing of her later infatuation with the young master.) Then she stands on a wooden board on the coast, whistling in the wind, seagulls soaring around her, and thin white clouds undulating and flying with the waves. This is a very good expression of her personality.</p>
<p>(2) After David returns home from Bundy, he begins to live a miserable life. Before he is beaten by his stepfather for not reciting his book, the director uses close-ups of the whip and his aunt's sewing needle to describe David's fearful state of mind. When we see him being beaten, we deeply sympathize with him and deeply hate that stepfather. Until his mother dies in her bed, it is a bleak dusk with bitter winds and rain. He escapes down like a prisoner, shouting loudly, which cannot but move people.</p>
<p>(3) David walks to his aunt's house, repeatedly using the meter to not explain the distance, and at the same time, explaining his hardships from his clothes. He immediately writes about his aunt's habit of driving horses to his aunt's house, which is as simple and lovely as Michael Burr's previous return home from the window to avoid debt. Later, when David tells his aunt about his various experiences, we shed tears of sympathy for him.</p>
<p>(4) Another thing to mention is that young David and his friends go to fisherman Bundy's house, just as Xiao Liu is secretly engaged. At this time, the singing of David's friend is not accompanied by music to show the simplicity of the countryside, which is also unique. Later, the storm and huge waves that engulfed the boat showed us excellent photographic technology.</p>
<p>The above are all more prominent and special places, which explains the success of "David Copperfield" in terms of expression methods. As for its nature, it is not within the scope of this article.</p>
<h3 id="e271">A Critique of "Babbitt" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Babbitt——A Cathay Film Production</p>
<p>In reviewing "Babbitt," we must first address its original author, Sinclair Lewis. People will not forget that he was the recipient of the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature, nor will they forget that he was the author of "Main Street."</p>
<p>Anyone who has read his works likely understands him to be a satirical writer. Whether in "Main Street" or "Babbitt," he used a satirical pen to depict the vulgar views of small-town philistines on the world, or to expose the ugliness of bourgeois and so-called upper-class gentlemen, or their mundane ways of conducting themselves.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we cannot help but think of writers like Crendon or the veteran writer George Moore (the original author of "The Lake"), who also appeared in the guise of satirical writers. These two writers were able to expose the maladies of society from an economic perspective, using satirical pens to expose readers to profound and spicy ridicule, while on the other hand, they gave great sympathy to the oppressed and sacrificed in present society. Therefore, from a realistic point of view, they should receive extremely high honors; at least in America, they should be representatives of successful writers.</p>
<p>However, Lewis is the standard American bourgeois writer. He does not satirize or expose things from their essence; he only superficially satirizes the lack of morality of upper-class people. He believes that the wealthy gentlemen should not be treacherous and cunning. These things are delicate and refined depictions of the philistines he saw, while on the positive side, he actively supports the existing society, like a loyal servant mocking his master's tuxedo for not being elegant enough. Perhaps their master will dress neatly because of this mocking advice.</p>
<p>Now let's look at how he wrote in "Babbitt"? The protagonist, Babbitt, is a complete bourgeois with a vulgar outlook on life. He is infected with all the bad habits that philistines possess. And this kind of person is despised and played with in the upper class, but also exposes the filth of upper-class morality. Although these things have been somewhat deleted in the film's performance, we can still see him infatuated with women's letters, flattered to be embraced as a backbone of the Zebra Club, holding vulgar and unbearable views in the deliberations for establishing a library, associating with powerful figures to show off in front of his wife, and doing things he doesn't want to do in order to curry favor—scheming to buy land for future resale to the government at a high price. In reality, he is a vulgar coward who reveals his conspiracy at the sight of female beauty and is at a loss when threatened by women, almost wanting to commit suicide. He feels ashamed when he sees the newspaper's criticism of him, but fortunately, he has a capable wife who takes care of everything for him, covering up his ugliness and making him re-embraced by the people, so he is overjoyed again. Such a vulgar bourgeois is naturally a ridiculous figure in people's eyes. But what impression does this give people? Does it give people a clear and essential understanding of the Luo Hui of society? No, it just makes people laugh.</p>
<p>Due to the tight structure of the script in the film, due to the director's lack of attention to stiff shots, and due to the excellent acting skills of the lead actress, Aline MacMahon, this film is not without its merits. However, as a comedy, this film is not very lively, and there is too much dialogue, which inevitably makes people feel a little tired.</p>

<p>— Tong Yun</p>
<p>The girl laughed again and said, "Whatever you say." Jim glanced at her, feeling that this socialite was too arrogant. He was her superior, and he should show some of the colors of a superior. So he said solemnly, "How can it be whatever I say? You either are or you aren't, you can't just let others say you are. " The girl said, "You're right. I am Agnes... Nancy Sharon... but that's not my real name. Jim deliberately raised his eyebrows, looked at her, and said, "Royalty? Nobility? Hiding your name like this?"</p>
<p>Sharon knew he was teasing her, but she didn't seem to care and said, "Neither. My real name is Sharon Nugget." Jim said, "Nugget? Any relation to Mrs. Sailor Nugget of Newbold?" Sharon said, "That's my mother." Jim couldn't help but make a "wow" sound and asked her how long she had been working as a newspaper reporter. Sharon said, "Not long. But I know it's not a difficult thing." Jim lit a cigar himself, looking at her with his eyes half-open and half-closed. Her conceited attitude, her body full of fragrance, and her childish voice all made him feel uneasy, and he didn't like that kind of woman. Moreover, her blood-red lips and fashionable clothes aroused a sense of hostility in him.</p>
<p>He thought for a while and suddenly asked, "Do you like your work?" Sharon said. "Couldn't be better. There are unexpected interests. Of course, I can't limit myself to music reviews. I have to learn everything. I think the editing methods of a modern newspaper must be improved, and truly knowledgeable people must be used."</p>
<p>Jim listened to her and didn't say anything himself. He picked up a proof and pretended to look at it carefully. But Sharon continued to talk eloquently, "I think the News Record is a little more advanced than other newspapers, so I chose this newspaper as my place for practical experience. I think that no matter how sufficient a person's ideals are, experience is indispensable... Do you agree?" She said, smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>At this point, Jim was planning how to deal with this arrogant socialite. He coughed slightly, pretending to be attentive, and said, "Shall we order two cups of tea?" She knew he was making fun of her, but pretended not to know and said, "That couldn't be better." After she said that, she sat waiting for tea. Jim slowly looked at the proofs one by one, made two phone calls, but neither ordered tea nor paid attention to her. Sharon, on the other hand, continued to wait, not discouraged at all. She waited quietly for him, she wanted to discuss that music review. After waiting for a long time, she saw that Jim had nothing important to do except push the paper back and forth, so she took the initiative to say, "Didn't you see me to discuss that review?"</p>
<p>Jim was asked by her, and then raised his head and said, "Oh... that's right. That article is too... too wonderful... too profound. Of course, with your level, it's not difficult to write, mocking those old-fashioned people who like to listen to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to the point of being completely defeated, but... my readers may not agree with your views." Sharon's face flushed, and she glared at him fiercely. It turned out that he had called her to make fun of her. She admitted that he was young and handsome, but the fact that he didn't take her seriously and used her the first time they met made her hate him from the bottom of her heart. (To be continued)</p>
