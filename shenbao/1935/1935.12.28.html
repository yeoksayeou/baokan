<h3>英美貨幣戰爭之展開</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>近二週來美國在倫敦减少購銀世界銀價因以暴落英美間之貨幣戰爭乃又惹人注意矣</p>
<p>貨幣戰爭爲爭奪商品市塲之手段其發生於英美間者當以一九三一年十月英國禁金出口停止金本位抑低匯價以促進對外貿易侵奪美國商品市塲爲嚆矢至一九三三年四月美國亦停止金本位貶低幣値以與英鎊相抗世界經濟會議以後兩國間之貨幣戰爭更趨激烈英國結成龐大集團控制若干關係國之金融美國則於運用巨額平準基金作匯兌傾銷外更實施白銀國有政策提高銀價收買大量白銀窺其用意實在提高銀本位及金匯兌本位國家之購買力而控制彼等之貨幣權也</p>
<p>然銀政策實施之結果不但不能提高銀本位及金匯兌本位國家之購買力反予英國以擴大金鎊集團之機會而銀價高漲更使用銀國家遭受莫大之危害至十一月四日我國迫不得已改革幣制對內行使法幣對外統制外匯並規定法幣外匯率以法幣一元合英金一先令二便士半爲標準美國深恐遠東最大市塲從此爲英鎊席捲以去於是乘我國在倫敦出售存銀以供三行購買外匯資源之機在倫敦暫停購銀以打擊英鎊集團十二月十日美國銀派領袖湯姆士公開發表攻擊英國之言論指斥英國欲使我國貨幣與英鎊聯繫此後美國雖仍繼續在倫敦購銀但數量大减二週以來銀價回跌八便士英匯平價與匯價之差額僅爲三便士半我國政府集中之現銀原以供三行購買外匯之資源者因此在價値上不免驟見緊縮此最近英美貨幣戰爭之展開對我國幣制之影饗也</p>
<p>今茲我國財政當局有鑒於此已注視法幣與英鎊比率是否將隨世界銀價漲落而伸縮預籌所以應付之方此一問題至爲複雜殊不易在此作明確之檢討然吾人所能確言者欲圖國民經濟之復興總當使我國幣制脫離美金與英鎊角逐之漩渦耳</p>

<h3>法蘭西的國家銀行</h3>
<p>— 徐逸</p>
<p>近來法國的政局，多半是以財政爲關鍵，而財政上最大的癥結，又是緊縮政策和金本位的維持問題。今年五月下旬，總理佛蘭亭因爲衆院不允給他經濟獨裁的信任，只得辭職，繼任的蒲伊松，組閣纔得四天，也爲了同樣的原因下台。至六月七日，賴伐爾出任鉅艱，方能得到衆院的信任。其實賴伐爾的要求，和佛蘭亭原來的至張，是差不多完全一樣的，都是政府能够用命令的方式，維持法郎的金本位，幷且竭力設法防止通貨膨脹，和通貨貶值的投機。不過賴伐爾雖然已經得到了國會的信任，實際上政局每一搖動，現金還是常常大量流出，所以我們不時看見法蘭西國家銀行提高貼現的利率，以事防止。</p>
<p>我們要知道，法蘭西國家銀行，現在已經是左右法國政局的中心了。這幾天來，法國的現金，又源源流出，以致貼現利率，已經在兩星期內，由三釐提高到了六釐，不久或者政局上要發生劇烈的變化。將來的趨勢如何，現在固然很難預測，但是倘然略爲考察一下國家銀行的組織和背景，倒也可以稍爲明瞭一些法國政局的內幕。而將來變化的所以然，也就有蛛絲馬跡可尋了。</p>
<p>法蘭西的國家銀行，是拿破崙所創辦的，成立在一八零零年；一百三十幾年以來，經過了不少政體上的變化；其間有三次强鄰侵入國境。一八七一年，巴黎總行的所在地，還曾被共產黨所統治，然而國家銀行的組織制度，甚至當權的人物，向來總是不改拿破崙時代的體例。到今年春天，更公然牽入了政治的漩渦。而賴伐爾政府的緊縮政策，也是這次銀行干政的間接結果。</p>
<p>社會黨對於國家銀行，非常不滿。他們說國家銀行是侵犯人民的主權，和國家的意旨，是金融界的寡頭政治。國家銀行的董事部，是把持國政的機關；然而銀行中的董事，却處之泰然，只說：『我們在最危急的時候，已經挽救了法郎的地位。我們也保全了國家的財富，阻止了財政上的恐慌。倘然這是叫做專權弄政，那末，就應當更加多弄些了。』</p>
<p>實際上法國國家銀行，是一個國家設立的有限公司。公司中的十八萬二千五百股股份，都在私人手裏，政府是一股也沒有的。政府商派總裁一人，和副總裁二人：銀行是財政部的代理人，也是唯一發行通貨的機關。拿破崙說：『我要國家銀行歸總裁統制，可也不要統制過份。』這就是雙方牽制的本意。</p>
<p>股東必須是法國公民，股份最多的二百個股東，有出席股東大會的資格。但是不論股份多少，每人只有一票。股東大會選舉董事十五人，監事三人，董事監事和正副總裁所組織的常務會議，就是執掌銀行一切大權的中心。總裁的資格，至少須有一百股，副總裁須有五十股，任期並無限制。董事至少須有三十股，但是事實上現在須要有了八十五股，纔能出席股東大會。董事人選，至少須有五個是實業家或者商人，三個是財政部的官員，其餘雖然沒有規定，却大半都是銀行家。</p>
<p>根據去年銀行的報吿，股東總數是四一，六六八人。在表面上看來，這許多的股東，分配十八萬二千五百股，是應當沒有把持的餘地了。然而仔細的一調查，其中只有一股兩股，三股五股的股東，倒佔據了三萬五千多人。有五十股以上的只有三百六十三人。照銀行章程，出席股東大會的，只以股份最多的二百人爲限。那麽自然非要有了八十五股以上，不能有這種資格了。</p>
<p>銀行最初成立的時候，股份的票面，是每股一千法郎。後來價值逐漸增高，最高的時候，曾經到過二萬三千法郎。現在雖然已經大跌，也在一萬法郎左右。所以要出席股東大會，至少先須投資八十五萬法郎。（折合國幣約十九萬元）纔能入選。資格旣然如此其嚴。所以這大會裹的二百個股東，自然就成功了法國國家經濟上最大的勢力了。幷且有許多股東的股份，都是家傳的資產，世世相承，很少轉移；更是那十幾個董事，簡直和世襲的爵位一般，翻開歷年的報吿書來，老看見的總是這十幾個名字。可惜因爲篇幅關係，此處不能一一列舉。總而言之，他們都是法國資本家中的頭兒腦兒，而且都是利害相關，互通聲氣的人。</p>
<p>有一位法國的新聞記者，曾經仔細研究過十二位董事的實在勢力。據他調查的結果，法國有九十六家大公司的董事部裹，都有他們的名字，一共佔據了一百五十席的地位。那些大公司是銀行三十五家，保險公司八家，鐵路公司九家，輪船公司八家，冶金公司七家，電氣公司六家，礦務公司八家，化學工業公司十二家，和其他公司七家。他們在全國金融界和實業界中，相互間都有很深的關係；所以在國家銀行的董事部裏，也意氣相投，不怕別人來侵犯他們的勢力。雖說正副總裁，是政府所指派的，或者可以有些牽制，然而總裁的資格，至少須有一百股的股份。換句說話，就是須有一百萬法郎的資產。本來有錢的人，當然不致與董事部反對；有些總裁，受任之後，還要設法借錢，或者借用股份的名義，而多數的股份，又都在董事手裹。於是總裁和董事之間，常常會發生債務關係，結果是總裁依舊和董事部一鼻孔出氣。</p>
<p>資本家的一切主張，當然不是左傾的政黨所能同意的。法國經過了四年的經濟衰落，人民方面已經備受艱苦，賴伐爾政府的緊縮政策，尤其是减低薪水，更引起了各方面的反對。在激進份子的眼光裏，賴伐爾無非是國家銀行的工具，他就任總理的條件，完全是聽命於國家銀行董事部的。</p>
<p>這種資本家把持的情形，究竟是否應當支持下去，現在的確已經成了問題。以後的政府，究竟能否仍舊尊重國家銀行的勢力，也不能預料。當然有了法國，必須有個國家銀行。但是現在的組織，經過了一百三十五年不曾變動，究竟是否仍舊適合法國的國情，這些問題的答案，是全世界所迫切期待的。</p>

<p>紐約　垣街日報華盛頓訪電稱、美財部主持下世界銀行之恢復、顯然將視中國白銀國有計畫之進行與中美間將來談判之結果而定、美財部之容許銀價下趨也、顯然一種壓迫舉動、欲使日入私運中國白銀事不復有利可圖、而終止耳、此種計畫一旦成功、而中國有實施其必要的貨幣改革政策之時間後、美財部當可重行提高銀價、惟事前或將設法成立關於白銀爲中國通貨的前途之一種協定或諒解云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　參院白銀調査委員會主席畢德門今日表示贊成財部在世界銀市之措施、財部因匯兌關係所取之途徑、實屬當然、余對於財長毛根韜實施購銀計劃感覺滿意、至於中國則終將恢復銀本位、彼未見下屆國會將提出重要之銀法、畢氏繼稱、彼逆料歐洲時局平靜之後、世界通貨卽可穩定、但畢氏不欲說叨何時始能穩定、惟當此各國政府紛紛備戰、創議穩定、實屬徒勞、畢氏又謂、財部每月平均購銀五千萬盎斯、較諸現行銀法通過前爲多、外國黃金之大批流入、僅係暫時現象、世界通貨穩定之後、此項金銀仍將流出國外、惟此項硬貨、對於美國將來談判穩定幣制時、頗具價値也、畢氏復評論中國之貨幣問題，論調甚爲悲觀、稱中國之管理通貨、定將失敗、華人僅知施用銀幣、而懷疑紙幣、南美情形亦復如此、此種國家、無論恢復金本位與否、必具備大量白銀、一俟貨幣穩定時期成熟、美國卽將以準備金供給彼等之中央銀行、中國最近之白銀恐慌、一部份由於國民政府預佈禁運及國有白銀之聲明所致、結果則存錢偸運出口、銀價之漲落不定、有害美國對華貿易、但銀價之低落、中國應感滿意云、（廿六日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　聯邦儲備委員會今日發刋之月報載稱、今年十一月十日起至十二月五日止、美國進口之黃金共値七六六•〇〇〇•〇〇〇元、其原因如下、　歐洲時局使流動資金移至紐的、　外人購買美國證券、由此可見外國投資人咸認投資美國市塲有利、　金集團國家之資本、最易受國家預算及政局之影響、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　參院外交委員會主席畢德門最近關於日本言論、曾哄動一時、今日謂報紙所載尚未能達意、故彼不久仍擬在參院演說、以答覆日本駐美大使齋藤所謂「美國人民勿重視彼之言論」云、畢氏上次演說之後、經報界訪問、雖曾重申共辭、然今日之語氣、已稍改變、其語云、「予在拉伐加斯所論者、爲現在日本之軍人政府、顯欲統制東亞、然後擴張至太平洋各島、如軍人政府之野心不戢、且能繼續秉政、則此種野心、尚將擴大、而美國未必不致設法保護其本國人民、及其他依恃美國保護之人民也」、（廿六日國民電）</p>

<h3>耶穌聖誕節　本年最為苦悶　羅馬敎庭之觀察</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡　敎廷機關報「羅馬觀察」報頃評論時局云、「歐洲頃在不安定之狀態下、渡過聖誕節、一般人無作妥協之語者、吾人亦未見成立妥協定之可能、自歐戰以還、聖誕節實以本年最爲苦悶、歐洲前途、苟不以抽象的空言爲基礎、而欲以具體事實以依據、則時局問題之檢討、自當以英國前外相霍爾在該國下議院所發之演說、爲其出發點、霍爾爵士、凱切陳　、不稍含混、此在意國報紙亦稱之爲「爽直而可同情之人、」至英法兩國所提建議、在英國視之、雖云夭折、在法國與國聯會視之、則依然存在、爲今之計、自以舊事重提爲是也云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國際互援問題　各國覆英多贊同</h3>
<p>倫敦　英政府近向地中海各國探詢關於依照國聯約互助問題之態度、今已先後接到法國·南斯拉夫·希臘·土耳其·等國美滿之覆文、允於意國攻擊實施制裁之任何國時、遵守國聯盟的第十六條第三節之規定、履行其義務、換言之、此項覆文、卽重行聲明、今秋日內瓦所通過之决議案也、此種語言、不得與軍事裁判問題相淆蓋軍事制裁全爲另一事件也、將來如證明有互助行動之必要、則將同樣施行紅海與地中海、西班牙大約亦將聲明其對互助問題之態度、惟英政府未正式向之探詢、僅與作非正式之討論耳、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>德里　內閣頃就西班牙對於意阿爭端所處地位、尤其是英國所提海軍互助問題、加以討論、事後幷由外長特佛拉斯戈向報界發表談話稱、「閣　所討論者、純屬國際問題、此際未便有所宣布、下星期二日當可發表宣言」云、按英國政府曾於本月初間向南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·土耳其·希臘·西班牙·五國提出問題、詢以英國海軍若果在地中海被人襲擊、各該國是否準備加以援助南希·土·羅·四國、當予以滿意答復、至西國則因英國外相艾登雖曾與國聯會西班牙代表瑪達利伽談及此事、但幷未直接有所要求、因而未能提出復文、本日閣議所討論者、當係如何答覆一項問題、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅馬方面　仍有外交接洽　法大使取銷巴黎之行</h3>
<p>羅馬　外交界雖因假期而停止活動、但美聯社記者今日得悉、此問現正進行一種暗中接洽、此項發展之內容現尚難證實、惟外交界咸信法國大使狄香布龍突然取銷聖誕節返巴黎休假之舉、殊堪重視、政府要津方面之外交策動亦甚顯著、但非至明年初不致恢復大規模之外交談判、届時英國方面、新任外相艾登將為主角矣、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意國報紙今日仍向英國大肆攻擊、且引某軍事專家之語、謂阿軍在北路前綫之攻勢、亦受英國之影響、英國顯然希望意軍失敗、俾可無須擴大對意制裁之範圍云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　講壇報頃載稱、「英國政策、業已確定踏入極端制裁主義之途徑，惟法國政策是否將與英國結爲反意集團乎、此則意國輿論自屬有權過問者也」日前法國左派參戰軍人聯合會執行部、議决宣言、各國若對意大利作戰、不啻禍起蕭牆、該會决不聽任法國派遣一兵一卒、參加此項戰爭云云、講壇報對此宣言、加以批評「法國之於作戰一舉、在昔從未畏懼、今亦了無難色、惟在法國以爲、對於國聯會所採决議案、若作別有用意及不利於意國之解釋、並為支持此種解釋而致引起歐洲衝突、實為罪惡之尤、則以戰端一啟、其貽禍之大、將不堪設想故也」云云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　英法兩國所提意阿爭端解决方案夭折之後、半官式意大利日報頃又加以評論云、「此項方案、意國未能直截了當予以接受、其故有四，　阿國若干地方、感受意國文化、已五十餘年之久、决無讓予阿國之可能、　阿克遜城在阿國雖屬聖城、但意軍佔領之後、業已解放奴隸、設立醫院未便以之歸還阿國、　英法提案、主張以唐拿凱與沃加丹兩區域不毛之地、劃歸意國、非意國所能接受、　關於意國殖民地帶英法兩國提案、對於意國移民與其利益、未能提出切實保障」、又况一九〇六年英法意三國條約、暨一九二五年英意兩國恊定、均曾在國聯會登記、其所畀予意國之利益、較之英法兩國巴黎建議案、遠爲廣大歟云云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維也納　汛日耳曼新聞社今日報吿、意國境內日耳曼血統之人民已有一千六百五十人逃往德國　以避征阿軍役、該社並稱　意國現正逼迫此等逃亡者之家屬、以謀强制彼等返意云、（二十六日國民電）</p>

<p>安戈拉　衆院頃通過法案、准許政府撥欵二千一百萬鎊、（土耳其幣名）作爲充實空軍之非常經費、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英德並未談判　天空條約問題　德方否認英使晤希特勒</h3>
<p>巴黎　英國駐德大使費普斯爵士前於十二月二十日晋謁德國希特勒元首、有所商談、此舉雖經該大使館否認、但事業報外交訪員、頃已加以證實、據云、希特勒於本月十三日與費潑斯會晤之時、雖曾表示在意阿爭端猶未結束之前、英德兩國締結天空雙方公約之舉、實屬不合時宜、但至二十日再度會晤時、則確曾向英國大使提出此項協定方案、特其內容尚無所知耳、至關於限制德國陸軍兵力一層、則據事業報所知、希特勒亦曾於十三日向英國大使表示、謂德國戰前殖民地一日不歸還、英國一日不承認德國不負歐戰戎首之責、則德國一日將拒絕考慮此項問題云云、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　法國事業報曾載稱、英國駐德大使費潑斯爵士、前於本月二十日晋謁希特勒元首時、希氏曾向之提出關於英德兩國締結天空雙方公約之方案、此說頃由半官式德意志通信社加以否認、該社幷謂、據官方宣佈、是日英國大使幷未與元首相會晤、至該報所謂英國大使、曾於本月十三日、與元首一度會談、亦屬無稽云、（二十七日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>柏林　本年六月中、英德二國成立海軍恊定、其中關於空軍之規定、至今日始由航空部長戈林發表、根據該項恊定、英國准許德國之海軍飛機裝載炸彈及施放烟幕等機械、轟炸機得裝載機槍、大型之航空母艦及戰艦得裝設海軍飛機之推射機、此項規定、對於飛機之防禦力、頗爲重視云、（二十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>國語科講演　閱讀甚麽　（續）</h3>
<p>— 開明書店編譯部主任　夏丐尊</p>
<p>次之講到參考書，如果諸君之中有人問我，關於某一科應看些甚麽參考書，我老實無法回答，我以為參考書的需要因特種的題目而發生，是臨時的，不能預先决定。乾脆地說，對於第一種職務的書籍，閱得馬馬虎虎的人，根本就無參考書的必要，要參考先得有題目，如果心裏並無一定想查究的題目，隨便拿一本書來東翻西翻，是毫無意味的傻事，等於在不想查生字的時候去胡亂翻字典，就國語科舉例說，諸君在國語敎科書裏讀到一篇挑花源記如果有不曾明白的辭兒，得翻辭典，這時辭典（假定是辭源）就成了參考書，這篇文章（桃花源記）是晋朝人做的，如果諸君覺得和別時代人所寫文章，情味有些兩樣，要想知這晋代文的情形，就會去翻中國文學史（假定是謝無量編的中國文學史）這時中國文學史就成了諸君的參考書。這篇文章裏所寫的是一種烏托邦思想，諸君平日因了師友的指敎，知道項國有一位名叫馬列斯的社會思想家寫過一本理想鄉消息，和陶潛所寫的性質相近，拿來比較，這時理想鄉消息就成了諸君的參考書。這篇文章，是屬於記叙一類的，諸君如果想明白記叙文的格式，去翻看記叙文作法，假定是孫俍工編的），這時記叙文作法就成了諸君的參考書，還有，這篇文章的作者叫陶潛，諸君如果想知道他的為人云翻晋書陶潛傅或陶集，這時晋書或陶集就成了諸君的參考書，這許多參考書都有了題目才發生的，沒有題目，參考無從做起，學校圖書館雖藏着許多的書，諸君雖實有許多的書，也毫無用處。國語科如此，別的科目也一樣，諸君上歷史課，聽敎師講英國的工業革命一課，如果對於這件歷史上的事跡發生了想查究的問題，就得會請問敎師得到許多的參考書，圖書館藏着英國史，各種經濟書類，以及近來雜誌上所發表過的和這事的關係的單篇文字，都成了諸君的參考書了。所以，我以為參考書不能預先開單子，只能照了所想參考的題目臨時來决定。在到圖書館去尋參考書以前，先自己問問自己，我所想參考的題目是甚麽？有了題目，不知道找甚麽書好，這是可以問敎師問朋友，查書目的。最怕的是連題目都沒有。</p>
<p>上面所講的是關於參考的話，再其次要講第三種關於趣味修養的書了·這在的書·可以說是和學校功課無關的，不妨全然照了自己的嗜好和需要來選擇。一個人的趣味是會變更的。一時喜歡繪圖的人也許不久會喜歡音樂。喜歡文學的人，也許後來會喜歡宗敎。至於修養方面更廣，變動的情形更多。在某時候學得自己心身上的缺點在甲方面，該補充矯正，過了些時，也許會覺得自己身心上的缺點在乙方面，該補充矯正了。這種自然的變更，原不該勉强拘束，最好在某一時期，勿把目標更動。這一星期讀陶詩，下一星期讀西洋繪畫史，趣味無法涵養了。這上星期讀曾國藩家書，下星期讀程　語錄，修養就難得效果了。所以，我以為這類的書，在同一時期中，種數不必多，選擇却要精。選定一二種，預定了時間來好好地讀。假定這學期定定好了某一種趣味上的書，某一種修養上的書，不妨只管讀去。正課以外，有閒睱就讀，星期日讀，每日功課完畢後讀，旅行的時候在車上船上讀，逛公園的時候，坐在草地上讀。如果讀到學期完了，還不厭倦，下學期依舊再讀，讀到厭倦了為止。諸君聽了我這番話，也許要駭異吧。我自問不敢欺騙諸君，諸君讀這類書，目的不在會考通過，也不在畢業遲早，完全為了自己受用。一種書讀一年，讀半年，全是諸君的自由。但求有益於自己就是，用不着計較時間的長短。把自己喜歡的書永久地讀，是有意義的。趙普讀論語，是中國有名的歷史故事。日本有一位文學家，名呌坪內逍遙，新近才死。他活了八十多歲，却讀了五十多年的莎氏比亞劇本。</p>
<p>我的話已完了，現在來一個結束，我以為：書是供給知識的一種的工具，讀書是改進生活豐富生活的手段，該讀些甚麽書，要依了生活來决定選擇。首先該閱讀的是關於職務的書，第二是參考書，第三是關於趣味修養的書。中學生先該把敎科書好好地閱讀，因為中學生的職務就在學習中學課程。參考書可因了所要參考的題目去决定，最要緊的是發見題目。至於趣味修養的書可自由選擇，種數不必多，選擇要精，讀厭倦了才更換。　（完）</p>

<h3>連珠遠射妙中籃心　良華克海賊色舞眉飛　五十比四十三最後良華四人應戰　局勢萬分緊張良華被罰下者五人　今晚兩隊再會師申園</h3>
<p>不敗之海賊、昨果爲良華敗矣、良華之勝、一方面固有其卓絕之戰鬥精神、一方面實亦因球運之光臨、得以隨其所願、美麗之遠射、使人嘆爲觀止、讚不絕口、全局形勢之緊張、爲從來籃球賽所未見者、人氣之狂熱、更爲罕有之現象、勝負之分、事前旣不能預料、當競爭時更不可判斷、非至時間終了、絕不能判定誰勝誰負、兩隊戰士、亦不能以其暫時之優勢而爲最後之勝利、然而良華卒以五十比四十三擊敗其前此之敵對、不敗之海賊隊矣、</p>
<p>三將缺席</p>
<p>局勢之緊張興奮、除在塲之觀衆祇能作深刻之回味外、亦類多不能道出其中之情景、今欲以筆墨來傳達比賽之經過、實爲萬不可能之事、祇能在此輕描淡寫中、由讀者去體會當時之情景耳、良華之勝、實爲上海籃球界揚眉吐氣、並亦　雪去年失敗之恨矣、因良華之唐寳堃、因京滬火車阻斷未能趕到、劉振元亦因手傷休息、驟然失去主要戰士兩員、當初曾有許多觀衆大呼二之名、並謂唐寶堃不來、殊不値枵腹而來一觀也、其决後衛大將尹鴻祥亦缺席、</p>
<p>遠射得勝</p>
<p>幸而唐劉二人不出塲、否則良華仍將爲海賊之敗將、藍劉唐二人不能遠射、昨晚之戰、非遠射萬不能有獲勝希望、徐兆熊爲良華之一顆明星、海賊幾决有抬頭之希望、徐兆熊輒加以當頭一棒、來一次遠射、挫其鋒芒、其决允推尹煥文、戳力防守、亦時以遠射建功、李震中自有其特殊功夫、無疵可摘、總而言之、昨晚之勝、决非一二人之力量所造成、全隊皆有其偉大之戰績在焉、上塲正式五虎、入後罰去其四、僅存李震中一人、而最後僅以四人掙扎、幾至於全隊瓦解、功虧簣一虧、張景實上塲五分鐘即被罰出、某西人裁判員專注意其一人、似乎不算高明、</p>
<p>海賊慌張</p>
<p>因局勢之過份緊張、雙方之投擲每多操之過急、向以罰球最有把握著稱之海賊、在對方二十七次之犯規中、僅罰中十二、史規亞態度並不文明、行動最多烟火氣味、張景實之最早罰出、史規亞有以促成之、顧史規亞反至比賽將終時纔罰出、未免寃枉、卡爾生之勇而不忙、爲海賊第一出色人材、以其努力、使全隊生氣勃勃、長脚萊茵在籃下無論攻守、得力最多、惜有時碍手碍足、無大用處、實技術並不高明、僅能利用其鶴立雞羣之身軀而已、</p>
<p>觀衆盛况</p>
<p>觀衆誠如酒醉後之瘋漢、比賽緊張時、每一觀衆必有其表情、更非筆墨所能形容、比賽完畢、其嗓音必大打折扣、五時許即包圍西靑年會前後門、七點鐘球塲上下已擠得水洩不通、冒險者仍在欄杆邊一寸闊之踏脚上行走、擠向人羣中去、假如稍不安分、即有自樓上跌下之危險、吶喊觀呼之音聲、除非聾子、吾則亦即要成爲暫時聾子矣、比賽開始之前、西靑臨時持請之管事顧此失彼、在排擠門外希圖破門進塲之觀衆、未得進塲者至少在塲內人數兩倍以上、西靑年會之人員、無微章及無要者、亦祇能嘗閉門羹、此舉甚爲聰明、値得一書者、</p>
<p>僅差一分</p>
<p>上半時比數為二十一比二十一、係海賊史密斯最後一球超出者、張景實在八比五時即罰出、張之犯規、半屬有意、而其有意、確爲史規亞促成之、李震中偷冷飯、憑張景實之遠遞、打開紀錄、卡爾生造三比二佔先、沈聿恭躍起轉身、球在肩上拋出中的、史規亞再以五比四佔先後、即成良華之世界、卡爾生史密斯之努力、造成八比八、但海賊仍未能超出、十比十後、良華每以三四分領前、或僅勝一分、後者二十一比十六、成爲最大之差數、皮巨兩射中的、史密斯半塲遙射成功、遂以一分超出、結果上半時、</p>
<p>得意時期</p>
<p>下半時之情形至爲紊亂、亦最緊張、海賊興風作浪、以二十六比二十一耀武揚威、李震中拼命掙扎、尹煥文王世富頻施遠射、果然得心應手、二十九比二十六、良華又估優勢、自此良華鋒芒畢露、氣燄萬狀、觀衆之緒情、隨之激增、徐兆熊手快眼快、得球即射、路遠迨迨、均吿成功、以四十比三十一盛極一時、爲全局比數最後之時、亦觀衆最得意之秋、海賊如大夢初醒、利用長脚萊茵節節進逼、分數漸漸接近、良華並不稍讓、王有才尹煥又百步穿揚、仍以四十八比四十居先、</p>
<p>四人搏戰</p>
<p>斯時王世富尹煥文沈聿恭均先後罰出、史規亞亦即於此時免戰、四十八比四十二時、徐兆熊忽亦犯四次之規、後此良華祇能以四人應付、海賊乘機打刦、益見猖獗、局勢之岌岌、無過於此、呌囂呐喊、於斯益盛、李震中最後投中一球、終了之笛聲、隨此球之進籃而起、良華斯時之愉快、所給予羣衆興奮之狂熱、蕭伯納見之、亦必得意忘形、再不能幽默矣、</p>
<p>今晚再戰</p>
<p>今晚七時、兩隊須再遇於申園籃球房、是塲寬大、雙方可以盡量發揮威力、海賊昨晚在本塲旣敗、今晚必以全力報復、良華旣勝、自欲保持其勝利、兩隊旣各存一種私意、競爭亦必更甚於昨矣、裁判員勃蘭脫與瞿鴻仁、門票五角</p>
<h3>西靑籃球意外結果　東華敗於南星　五十二比四十七今晚曁南戰麥令</h3>
<p>昨晚西　籃球甲乙兩塲、出人意料中、南星以五十二比四七七擊敗稱强一時之東華、上半時東華以二十六比　十三佔先、下半時被南星以三比　　一超越前　、自此東華雖　力奮鬥、每以慌張而失機、反見南星聲洶洶、投籃　準、顯見有獲勝可能、卒以五十二比四十七挫敗東華、陳龍鮮因被良華海賊之戰所吸引之觀衆、擠於門外、不得出塲、實爲東華意外之重大損失、另一組約中敗於猶太、十八比二十三、</p>
<p>東華大將缺席</p>
<p>因次有良華海賊之比賽、觀衆已早於六時許擠滿球房之上下、東華南星之戰、於七時三刻開始、得如許羣衆之捧塲、亦意外之幸事、但即以如許之觀衆、供陳祥龍未能爲東華效力、開賽後東華仍奮發有爲、以十七比四遙前茅、後南星力追、以後衛之嚴密監視、前鋒周怒安等活潑驍男、追至二十三、而東華卒以二十六比二十三結束上半時、</p>
<p>南星後來居上</p>
<p>下半時起南星先發制人、脚成二十六比二十六之平手、此後東華又佔優勢、顧為時不允、終被南星以三十二比三十一嶄露頭角、於是形勢大變、東華反屈其下、從此竟未能再露鋒芒、初則祇差一二分、後成五十比四十二、當三十八比三十三時、南星董實初等兩决四次犯規出、但於局勢無礙、東華僅藉罰球機會增加分歡、終無效果、不得不甘拜下風、南星先前會劇抗海賊、僅負七分、今又戰勝東華、戰鬥精神、殊可嘉許、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（三）（七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>可是却沒有一件事可以抵償自由的損失；數小時的囚繫才使南恩知道自由是伺等地珍貴</p>
<p>在最後的一個肅靜的時間裹，常孩子們到溪邊去看愛彌新船下水時，她頭靠在窗畔上，那時却有無限感想，盤旋在她小小的腦際。這隻船已定名爲蜀　，算是紀念裴夫人的，本來是規定由南恩去行水禮，她早已想到怎樣當船下水時，她要奮力擊碎一小瓶的加崙子酒在那船梢上。如今她已失却了那個機會，而小梅做起來叉那裏及得她來呢？想起這都由於她自已的錯誤，淚點兒已湧上了她的眼睛；剛在那時，一個肥胖的蜜蜂正在窗下一朶玫瑰的黃花心裏滾來滾去她便對他高聲說道：</p>
<p>「假如你是跑走了的，你還是立刻回家去，吿訴你母親說你已懊悔了，决不再做了。」</p>
<p>「我高興聽見你給他那麼好的誥誡，我想他已接受了的，」蜀夫人笑說了，其時那蜜蜂已振動着他的滿染花粉的雙翼而飛去了。</p>
<p>一二點眼淚已亮晶晶落在窗畔上，南恩急急把它擦去，蜀夫人却已見到了，抱她起來，置於膝上，又溫言說道。</p>
<p>「你想我母親治療跑走的方法好嗎？」</p>
<p>「師母，是的，」南恩回答道，一天的靜肅已够使她降服了。</p>
<p>「我希望我用不到再試了。」</p>
<p>「我也推想不要了；」南恩說時仰頭一看，小臉上的懇摯，使蜀夫人見了，很爲滿意，也不再說一句話，因爲她寗可讓那種懲罰去貫澈它的效用，不願因口舌上多所責善，反致减損效力的。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （秋郎）</p>
<p>「做人難」「難做人」「做難人」憑你掉來掉去，總是說做人不容易！的確，做人千頭萬緒，旣要面面顧到，又得處處留意，在這世風不古，人心日下的今日，可謂難之允難！</p>
<p>譬如你有財產，盜賊旣時時在覬覦你，使你提心吊膽，不得安寗～倘然你沒錢的話，非但別人要鄙視你，而且難以維持生活！</p>
<p>至於用錢精明些，別人便說他「刮皮」，倘然用得闊綽些，人家又眨他「濫用」，對朋友過於忠實，也許有時會受人的欺騙，假使一味圓滑，人家又道他「浮而不實」，待下人寬了，無懼憚，緊了，招怨尤；向上級親了，跡近諂媚，疏了，又防失歡；所以上下左右，無處不難，惟有公正謹愼，採中庸之道，作處世南針。</p>
<h3>黃金和美人</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>我的朋友某君，案頭供着兩件不同風格而又絕不相稱的塑像，看了眞叫人失笑。一件是怒目睜眉，橫鞭跨虎滿身塑金的財神像，一看而知是十八世紀式的惠山貨。還有一件是大理石雕成的裸女，雲髮高簇，星眸斜睨，乳聳臀凸，玉體畢呈，這是合乎時代化的西洋貨。把這兩件時代不同性質不同的東西並立着，格外叫入觸目而又奇訝。有一天我竟老實不客氣的勸他，把財神撤去，讓那裸女獨立着還神氣些。他笑吟吟的掉着兩句經文道：「魚我所欲也，熊掌亦我所欲也。」我不明所以，又進一步的詰問道：「難道這一個不值錢的士偶，你還不捨得丟棄，放他在這裏丟醜嗎？」他這時面孔一本正經的同我說：這土偶誠不值錢，是我用兩個角子在泥人擔上轉來的，可是它象徵甚麼？不是代表人人喜歡的錢財嗎，有錢的人愛錢，沒錢的人也在渴慕着金錢，全世界人類，那個不膜拜在財神脚下，何况我也是一個凡人呢！所以我供奉案頭不啻晨夕禮拜，希望他早早降福給我咧！我聽了他話，又反詰道：「旣是你崇拜財神，爲甚麽再列一裸體像在旁褻凟神佛呢？」他又笑着說：「這又是我崇拜的愛神，算甚褻凟呢！從來黃金和女色相連的，一個人在窮困時侯，瞧瞧黃臉婆子，也覺可愛。有了黃金便不對了，非一絕色美人，不能和其黃金相輝映。你瞧那一個有錢人不挾着一個摩登的太太呢！所以我崇拜財神之餘，還在祝禱愛神，希望他倆一齊下降咧！」</p>
<p>我聽了他一番似莊似諧的話，竟無言可駁；細想之下，也覺自有大道理在內，因此寫出來給人批評一下。</p>
<h3>箬葉作</h3>
<p>— 周子欣</p>
<p>住着的鄰居，是夫婦倆，和着三個孩子，一起五個人的一個家庭，他們沒有祖上的遺產，來坐享淸福，也沒有固定的收入，供那日常的生話；闔家，都滋長在小小範圍的箬葉作上，維持他們的生活，衣，食，住；一切的…</p>
<h3>二件新玩具</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>箬葉作在都市裹是鳳毛麟角，很不常見到，範圍是很狹小，大都就在自己住居的屋子，讓着一方地，充做作塲，它是勞力的手藝生活，名稱那麽的粗俚，因此一般熟悉的人，也許都會存着一種蔑視之心，爲着它是手藝生活，勞力生活。</p>
<p>侵晨，寒風裹，就能聽到擾雜的沙沙的聲浪；伏在窗檻上，就能看到，在高高蓬鬆的箬葉堆裏，坐着些整理箬葉的人們，男的，女的，老的，少的；…………忙着的把那散亂的箬葉整理，爲着冀求二個銅元一斤的酬勞，酬勞是這樣的菲薄，細微，但，在這片刻的晨光，勞着他們的苦方獲得酬勞，是較甚麽都可貴。</p>
<p>扞的工作，是第二步的手續了，這可說完全是婦女的生活，酬勞是較那整理者優越得多，可是那工作，不比那先前的來得簡便哩，把片片的箬葉，扞成長闊的箬片，有着兩片橫着那開闊，兩英尺那麼的長度；酬勞的計算，也是估着重量，—斤—每斤是一分六厘，每天認眞些，也能得到四角多錢的代價哩！</p>
<p>「世界是變了，什麼事情都變了！不是麽，就是拿那箬葉作來說罷，從前每担賣着七塊錢，就有兩三塊的賺頭，生意還是興興旺旺的，現在是，不是頭路了，每担賣五塊錢，東也不要，西也用不着，還這樣的淸淡；眞的，世界眞是變了，」老關逢人就帶着這麽的口吻咕嚕着。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議　虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>劉太太本來是那麽摩登，抬起一隻雪白的手臂向他招着，不由他不因之動心。而且人家的態度，已經和軟了，有話商量，怎好不去？便帶了笑容走進去，笑道：那算什麽，我也犯不上躱。於是他走進屋去叉了腰，坐在床沿上，架了兩隻腿。瞪了雙眼，將人望着。劉太太却把兩隻玉臂抱在懷裹，向他也看了去。賈多才道：現在我進來了，各位有什麼話就說罷，我在這裹洗耳恭聽，反正我沒有什慶罪。劉太太把那白手伸出來了，向他指點着道：你把女人關在屋子裏，剝奪人家的自由，你還要說你沒有罪。賈多才道：他是我的　老婆，我不把他關在屋子裹，我把他放到大路上去不成。他也是氣極了，說出小老婆這三個字，可招上了大忌，所有女太太們，都上了火，全伸出手來指着他。有一個道：這人說話，這麼侮辱女性，非重重的敎訓他一頓不可！只這一聲，大家全哄了起來，有的人拿身子挺前一點，把手臂直指到賈多才臉上來。他心裏一想，假使讓他們伸手打了一個耳巴子，和誰去算這一筆帳去。於是扭轉身子向外面跑，在過廳裹跳若脚道：你們只顧管別人的事，却不管你們自己。你們談女人解放，先解放你們自己罷。爲什麽你們臉上擦胭脂，燙頭髮，穿高跟鞋，作那當玩物的樣子呢。這一句話剛剛說完，早有一件光華燦爛的東西，帶了幾條瑞氣，向頭上飛奔過來。回頭看時，早覺得是身上有什麽東西，鞭打了一下。同時，就聽到嘩啷啷一聲，是一把帶水的茶壺，由頭上飛過去，在地上砸了一個粉碎。賈多才心裏想着，縱然說錯了話，何至於用這樣强硬的手腕來對待。這個疑問，還不曾打破，又是漆黑一個柬西，兜胸打來，正是皮鞋。自這裹起，許多東西，猶如雨點一樣，向身上打着。賈多才這時就是長了一百張嘴，有話也無從說起。只將兩手伸到半空裹去亂搖。北海越是耍看這塲熱鬧，態度是越加鎭靜，只管鋪了一張報在面前，兩手伏在桌上來看着。偷眼看到賈多才將頭向前亂鑽，鑚到小西天　　　　。那些女太太們站在過廳裹全指手畫脚的喧嚷起來。（三八四）</p>
<p>小說枝談</p>
<h3>舊小說</h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>也是一件不可理解的事，舊小說忽然在月前這個時代大行起來。三國水滸這幾種在社會間具有潛勢力的小說是不必說了！連那些不大經見的舊小說也非常風行，到處有專賣舊小說的小書攤，而設攤的人，從前未必都是賣書的，旣是專賣舊小說，自然爲了買的人多，纔專門販賣。再看了這種書攤有增無减，又可見販賣者必能藉此維持生活；那麼，舊小說是怎樣的風行一時，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>有人以爲：舊小說之所以風行，是因爲價廉。但實際却未心，至多也只是原因之一而巳；這只要看了各書店廉價的新小說，並不如舊小說銷塲好，便可證明。最大原因怕還是爲了舊小說富於趣味，耐看，而恰巧售價又　，購買便利，便造成這個風行一時的現象。</p>
<p>我們以爲：舊小說的內容，雖己不合現代潮流，但說它怎樣壞讀之無益，却也未免偏激，至少，舊小說除了一都份涉及迷信的記叙外，對於我國固有的美德是頗能發揮盡致的，它給予讀者的影響，仍不失爲良好。就可惜現在各書攤所售的舊小說，訛字　　，不成文理的地方太多，校勘上未免太草！比較世界書局印行的舊小說，沒有校勘草率之弊。却又可惜巳印行的還不多，除弟一决紅樓夢等十種外，最近印行的也只有金瓶梅列國志等十餘種。他們除了校勘精密，裝訂美麗之外，每一種都提出內容的特點，又附有考證，把舊小說重行估價，倒也可算是適應環境的重要工作呢！</p>
<p>游於藝</p>
<h3>留日學生的話劇社</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在我國久巳衰退的話劇，想不到在日本的留日學生界內，却正在如火如荼的萌芽着。這是幾位學文藝美術的同胞，抱着以藝術復興話劇的决心。這回初次在日本成立了「中華劇團」，借着築地小劇塲作處女公演。成績甚佳，給日人和留學同胞一個很好的影象。第二次第三决公演的劇月也發表了。很有櫃績努力之勢，爲留日學生作新的活動。</p>
<p>久巳沒有看到故國的話劇，忽然得着「中華劇團」公演的消息，當然想領略一次故國的風味。所以連演兩天，每天兩决，都是滿座。在劇塲裹，除了安排坐位是日本的女子之外，一切都由留日學生招待着。觀衆當然都是同胞，互相很親密的招呼着。有幾個帶了日本女朋友來觀看從未見過的中國話劇。末幾排坐着幾個日本警察，呆着出神。眞要研究中國話劇而來的日人，恐怕沒有罷。</p>
<p>話劇共兩齣，一齣是吳天君所作的「决堤」，很像名小說「大地」的片斷、表演今歲長江流域的一個農村裹，王老爹的决男，因得罪了大地主何老爺而被捕。（話劇是被捕後開始的）。長兒金貴又因和收築堤捐的吳先生鬧翻了。於是吳先生去攛掇何老爺再把金貴捕獲，强迫去修堤。金實聽得修堤，便義不容辭的，離了老父妻子出去了。但時機太遲，防堤潰决了，吳先生又乘機把金貴推入水中。家中妻子得訊之後，也跳入水中殉夫，只留着金老爹和他的小女小毛。起初因為捨不得自己的財產，不肯逃避，結果水已浸入室內，要走不能。乃乞援何老爹吳先生的渡船而不應。只得相抱待斃。陳策君的金貴，李月軒的小毛，石天的王老爹，瑪麗的妻子，表演得都很好，在慘痛狂號的時候，莫不淚下如雨。記者也生長在長江流域多水的農村裏，此種事情差不多是親身經歴的。曾記得在大水時候，眼看着慈父愁眉望天，更是心痛如割。故自開幕至閉幕為止，同情之淚，始終沒有停過，可見他們表演得眞切了。</p>
<p>第二齣是「視察專員」，取材於俄國名劇郭哥里的原著，而改編爲中國的話劇。表演一個流浪的靑年，困守在旅館裹，被地方人士，誤認爲秘密的視察專員。受了盛大的歡迎和招待，縣長法官中學校長等，紛紛納賂獻媚。後來遷入縣長的家裹，又和縣長太太小姐鬧了香艷趣聞。結果只好脫逃，而事亦敗露。道時眞的視察專員方始光臨。這是一幕諷刺喜劇，把官塲黑幕，表演得淋漓盡致。但因原劇是以俄國作背景的，有許多地方，如跪在地上求婚，縣長引妻女出來招待？將專員移居到家裹等等，在中國究竟不多的。不過表演得很活潑，因結構鬆弛，沒有「决堤」那樣的緊張。</p>
<p>每幕之前，都有一棒鑼聲，不知是何意義。如若易以中西音樂，比較要動聽些。就是表演之中揷幾節音樂相輔，或者更可生色。怖景簡單而不背劇情，用電光表演雷雨日光都有意義。該團社昌費了一二月的心血，使這一次處女演，很能使觀衆欣佩，已是不容易了。</p>
<h3>用火表來測量耗阻器</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>火表又名啟羅華脫小時表，Kilo-watt　hour　meter，是發電廠用來測量用戶用電的多少的，普通裝電燈的人家，大半有這麼一具。有了火表，我們可以間接量出一個耗阻器的歐姆數。</p>
<p>量時，先關去全部的電燈，和一切用電的器具。把要量的耗阻器的二頭，接在電綫上，記下在某一時間裏用去的電的數目，然後用下面公式（用第二式），算出這耗阻器的歐姆數。</p>
<p>工中V是電壓的弗打數，A是電流的安培數，T是時間的小時數，W是電流去電的啟羅華脫小時數。</p>
<p>現在為明瞭起見，用一試騐的結果來做例子，如下。</p>
<p>有一個阻耗器，（已知是二千歐姆）用上法在上海城內測量，電壓V為二百二十弗打，在一分半鐘內，火表的圓盤共轉三轉，這火表上註明每一啟羅華脫小時圓盤轉四千八百轉。故知W是四千八百份之三啟羅華脫小時，T是六十份之一。五小時，V為二百二十弗打，代入上面第二公式中，算出得R如第三式。</p>
<p>答數R是一九三六歐姆，此數和這阻耗器上註明的二千歐姆，相差不過百份之三·二。</p>
<p>用本法測量時，應該注意被測量的阻耗器是吾發熱，若發熱甚大，應立卽將電流關去，吾則恐生意外。</p>
<h3>家庭旅行兩用强力三管收音機</h3>
<p>— 學綸</p>
<p>我們自己裝配收音機，目的總是要經濟，耐用，同效率高，但是要三樣兼備，眞眞不是容易的事體。還有用電的問題，更是最難解决，因爲我們靑年業餘家，决不是因守一個地方，所以拿收音機裝成交流的，恐怕將來因吃飯問題，要帶到沒有發電廠的地方，那麽這架收音機，幾乎就等於廢物了。倘然是現在住在偏僻鄕村，那是一定沒有市電的，所以裝配收音機時必定選用30號一類的眞空管，可是一旦有了事體，要住在都市裹去，還是要常常換電，豈不大大的寃枉麽？</p>
<p>這種問題，我想同志們常常常碰到的，我呢？也是共中吃虧的一個，俗話不是說的吃一决虧，學一次乖嗎？上月中我的交流收音機眞空管壞掉，就决計改用9.3v汽車管，好在電源變壓器的次級圈改繞是很容易的，化一天的功夫，裝成一架家庭旅行兩用機。前幾夫帶着牠同游馬蹟山，用一根臨時室內天綫，據然收到南京，鎭江，無錫的播音，在揚聲器裹很響的放出來。常時A電用四段小圓電，B電用兩打扁電。如若再拿B電加高，天地綫改良，我想牠的成蹟决不止這樣吧？裝配法如附圖：</p>
<p>L用美規二十六號漆包綫，在蛛網板上繞十四圈。</p>
<p>L１用美規二十六號漆包錢，在另一蛛網板上繞六十五圈。</p>
<p>L2用美規二十六號漆包錢，在另一蛛網板上繞三十二圈。</p>

<p>V6C6眞空管。V1三八號眞空管。　V21v號眞空管。</p>
<p>T電源變壓器　用　鋼片，疊至一吋厚。　初級用美規三三號漆包綫繞一〇九〇圈，次級高壓用美規三七號漆包錢一七一〇圈。次級低壓用美規二〇號漆包錢六〇圈</p>
<p>這機的電源部份，也可以同收音部份分裝兩隻木箱，這樣裝法後，收音機可以小巧玲瓏不少，有市電的地方用交流電供給，學到旅行的時候，放在手提包箱內，就可以隨身帶着收音了，同志們很值得一試的。</p>
<h3>成績優異的兩管廣播收音機</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>良好的收音機，全繁於完美的設計，和精密的製作。這已爲一般所公認的鐵則。反觀現今市上所充斥的劣貨收音機，其設計旣屬陳腐，而裝置又極草率：所用零件，更無庸說，都是些品質惡劣至於極點的。試想，要在這種收音機上，求所謂「成績優異，」豈非滑稽？可是事實上，偏有令人費解者，就是，許多淺見的人，都因貪一時的便宜，（？）而不惜置國家利害於度外，去買那些幾同廢物的劣貨機件。迨事後弊病百出，弄得不堪收拾，才徒呼上當，但是已屬無補於事。這種當，上得本不足惜，然而國家却無形又受了損失啦！</p>
<p>出了錢買當上，大家都不願意吧？那麽讓我來介紹給你們一只很易自製的兩管收音機，保證使你們能在它身上，獲得滿意的成績。</p>
<p>這機共用兩枚新式眞空管。一是6F7，利用其五極部份，作射電週率放大，三極部份，作回輸力柵漏檢波。一是79，用作兩級電阻交連成音週率擴大。所以選擇性和音量，都能相當的滿意。允其因爲是用79作電阻交連低放的緣故，音質特別柔美。較諸用42等强力擴大管，自然高明多多。</p>
<p>講到這機的裝置，原無多大困難。要之，卽爲兩高週率綫圈的調整。其實，假使綫圈繞製時，稍加注意；而所用同軸電容器，品質優良，這也不足慮了。全機裝於22''x5''x8''的鋁質底盤上除眞空管同軸電容器錢圈等大件外其餘均置底盤下。6F7眞空管及兩綫圈均宜加隔離罩以免感應。</p>
<p>這機的電源部份，我所以不繪出者，無非是可以讓各人自由變動，或以舊有者應用，以節省金錢而已。至於我所用的電源變壓器，那是專爲此機設計，而自行繞製的，計初級進綫220v次級高壓250v　30M．A．燈絲給熱電壓6.3v　1.2A。整流管用的是I-V，取其經濟省電；此外，尙有一好處，就是燈絲電壓祗須繞一枚6.3v者就可以了。不過，諸位如已有現成的類似强力三管機的電源變壓器，那末也可設法改用。茲將綫圈製法，及應用零件列下，以作結束。</p>

<h3>交流電壓的實效値</h3>
<p>— 華馨</p>
<p>爲什麽交流電流亦可以用安培來量，交流電壓亦可以用弗打來量？這個問題，只要我們認交流對於流經某耗阻一秒間所產生熱效應，與一安培的直流流經這耗阻一秒間所產生的熱效應相同時卽爲一安培，便可迎刃而解。五安培的直流流經二歐姆的耗阻每秒所發生的熱爲五十瓦特。五安培的交流流經2歐姆的耗阻每秒所產生的熱量亦爲五十瓦特。這樣的安培便稱為交流電流的實效値（Efective　Value）。交流電流的實效値等於電流的最大值（Maximum　Value）除以2的平方根，換言之，卽等於最大值乘（0.607）。設I代表交流的實效值，Im爲交流的最大值則</p>
<p>（註：2的平方根等於1.414）。同樣交流電壓的實效値亦卽爲其最大値與0.707相乘，設E爲交流電壓的實效値，Em爲交流電壓的最大値，那麽</p>
<p>或</p>
<p>最大値及實效値之外，尙有所謂平均値（Average　Value），於交流電整流為直流電時常應用之。平均値卽為交流在半週內各瞬時値（Instanteucoaus　value）的平均數偉，等於最大値0.637相乘。設Ia為電流平均値，E為電壓的平均值，則</p>
<p>在無錢電收發綫路中最大值，實效值及平均值常常應用，尋常交流電壓表所量的電壓均爲電壓的實效值，所量時電流，均爲電流的實效值，眞空管屏路中插入的直流電流表，所量的電流爲屏流的平均值。最大值有時亦可用眞空管電壓表（Peak　Vacuum-Tube　Voltmofer）量之。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗花拍至後市　拋空斬多並起</h3>
<p>紗市晨堅午跌、形勢轉向下游、環境不良、標金續挫、人心稍萎、買方亦呈踟蹰不前之狀、於是市勢一定、賣方乘機活動、達記空頭加碼、長豐多頭了結、以致檯面驟見鬆懈、市價乃跌一元外、</p>
<p>長豐金帮斬多</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、標金平澹、海外紗花狀况不佳各月微跌三·四角、但塲中新賣者未見十分踴躍、拍至二三盤時、錦昌證券又來照市收買、市價又見回振、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四·六角、本月獨跌四角、午後開盤市情忽見疲乏、塲內賣氣略濃、達記合興空頭紛紛加碼、長豐金業帮多頭斬結、大阪三品出猛跌二元半、市盤由此盤盤下落、最低價收盤、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌—元一角至一元九角二元、現鈔交易不暢、成交僅三包餘包、查賣出達記一千三百五十包、長豐二千九百五十包、合興一千六百五十包、愼記四百五十包、元一九百五十包、益昶三百五十包、買進錦昌一千二百五十包大昌成四百包、泰興九百五十包、大豐五百包、明華四百包、昶記七百五十包、潤康八百五十包、信誠一千二百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>達記空頭加碼</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉續跌、現貨一角二分關口又復打破、印棉停市、標金又見下落、人心軟化、但塲中新賣者缺乏、頭盤稍跌、二盤以後、重見回　、結果各月比上日收盤均漲五分至一角、午後開盤、市態忽轉虛弱、因大阪三品棉花下跌、標金敲破六十元關、因此人氣恐慌、市價步步下墮、但成交甚少、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五·六·七角、查賣出達記四千七百擔、益昶一千三百擔、潤康三千七百擔、長和二千二百擔、森康一千一百擔、元一一千八百擔、買進大昌成一千八百擔、源興昌八百擔、通記一千二百擔、益裕一千一百擔、愼記一千一百擔、福源一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>又據孟買電、二十七日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百十六羅比半、較上日收盤漲半羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　本月粉套頭回出</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致平定、洋麥報價、芝加哥好四角、遠好四分至二角不等、坎拿大利物浦、均停市無價、市塲人心、因年關結束、業內外出入甚少、一致觀望、各盤市面、與前日相仿、迨至下午開盤、市形忽見大鬆、因金價回跌花紗亦跌度頗甚、致一部分浮多、脫手甚暢、本月份因交割已近、一部分套頭回出、故跌勢較猛、計近落三分、遠跌一分、</p>
<h3>期麥收貨者不甚歡迎</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致平寂、本月份因交割關係、賣方預備交割者計二十餘車、聞貨品均屬合格、惟不甚高、故收貨者不甚歡迎、市氣停滯、當爲此故、至遠期各月份、閃洋麥漲勢無幾、且外行多頭、了結居多、故亦平軟、照國內粉銷未暢、得能匯市見宜、市氣當不致過分高昂、現麥開出山東四元九角、管店明光四元八角九分至四元八角八分、共計一千五百包、由福新辦去、價與前市相似、較週初巳漲一角、</p>

<p>— 衣白</p>
<p>國別　數量　百分率</p>
<p>蘇聯　二五七、四七〇　三三％一一</p>
<p>英國　一九三、三七一　三四％八五</p>
<p>美　國　五四、二九四　六％九七</p>
<p>印度　一一、七八二　一％五一</p>
<p>土埃波　四、六七三　〇％五一</p>
<p>日本　　三二六　〇％〇四</p>
<p>南菲　二八二　〇％〇二</p>
<p>其他　二五六、〇七三　三二％九〇</p>
<p>總計　七七八、二七一　一〇〇％〇〇</p>
<p>蘇聯佔三　％一一，無可疑義，為中國茶消費之最大市塲。在一九一五年時，中國茶輸至蘇聯（帝俄）曾達一百十六萬担之巨，佔中國茶輸出總額半數以上。其後因蘇聯發生革命，受各國封鎖，經濟至爲恐慌，節約之風普遍全國，華茶之輸　彼國亦大爲激滅，在一九二〇年曾激落至一萬一千担，至一九二五年漸呈恢復，增至二十萬担，至一九二九年後因中國與蘇俄國交斷絕，復由三十七萬担减至一九三〇年之四萬担。至一九三二年中蘇國交宣布恢復，華茶之輸蘇亦恢二十三萬担。自一九三二年至一九三四年雖呈一路增加，但總不能恢復一九二九年之水準。此即因蘇聯之自國植茶與日本茶錫　茶之輸人蘇聯也。</p>
<p>蘇聯之茶業，為五年計劃之產物，據聯蘇政府報吿，已耗四年之時間與二千五百萬盧布專　發展茶業。復據外商加索共和國京城提夫里斯最近發表，一九三五年靑茶之出產，可收一千二百萬公斤。茶國增加一萬六千海克他。從事茶業之農民達六萬四千餘人，組成　體農塲八百三十處，國家農塲十五處。此為中國茶輸蘇聯萎縮原因之一。又日本，印度，錫蘭等茶之向蘇聯市塲侵進，亦為中國茶輸入蘇聯萎縮原因之一。</p>
<p>蘇聯市塲之失去，實制中國茶業於死命。第二之希望祇繫維於英國。在六十七年前，英國原爲中國惟一市塲，在一八六八年中國茶輸出總額一百五十四萬担中，英國佔其一百二十二萬担。自一八六八年至一八八八年間，英國每年消費華茶總在一百萬担以上。但自一八八九年後，因印度之茶產生額激增，素爲中國惟一市塲之英國，遂爲印度等侵去，以致　茶輸英數量由一八八九年之八十九萬担落至一九零零年之二十四萬担。自一九零一年至今三十餘年中，平均每年在二十萬担左右。實有不堪回宵之感！最近華茶之不能在英活動者，因英國滙兌之低落。而日本茶正乘此世界貨幣鬥爭之時會，亦以貶值傾銷政策施之於英國等市塲，故中國茶實受三重之壓迫。華茶之與美國市塲，其情形與英國正復相同。自一九二六年以來，華茶之輸美一路低落。據一九三五年十月二十五日中華日報載，（聯僑社巴城報），一八八六年間美國輸入茶全係中國出品，至一九零六年，華茶輸入日本亦多，印度决之。後來印度及日本從事種植茶葉，現已日見發達，非但日本及印度國內之茶，無須再給於中國，且漸漸攫取華茶在美之市塲。現在除中國，日本爪哇之茶輸入美國推銷外，更有錫蘭，安南，之出品每日益增加。中國茶海外市塲不僅被新興之產茶國所奪去或侵入，且有新興產茶國之茶葉輸入中國之反常現象。據本年十月三十日中華日報載：「爪哇茶葉輸入中國在一九三一年爲五九五·五·六一公斤，一九三二年爲三二六·五二四公斤，一九三三年爲一五·八一零公斤，一九三四年爲九七·二二九公斤，四年之中，共計達一零·三三二·五二四公斤」復據一九三五年八月二十五日中華日報載：「一九三五年自一月至七月，外來茶葉輸入我國計建十五萬餘公担，內印度四·九零二公担，錫蘭爲二九·零零四公担，香港一五·五一九公担，日本二九·九三七公担，爪哇四八·七四七公担，其他各國一四·零九七公担，共値關金九二·五一八兩，合國幣爲十六萬七千二百九十四元之巨同時亦可知中國貿易機構之不健全！</p>
<p>各新興產茶國家之發展茶業政策，値此世界經濟恐慌時期更爲積極。例如爪哇政府，爲發展爪哇茶業，實施宣傳政策。在本年九月由七，〇〇〇盾，此項巨大宣傳費，由每百基羅茶徵稅九角七分，以資彌補。</p>

<h3>白米病</h3>
<p>— 姚爾昌醫師</p>
<p>本症係因專喫機器高白米而起。由以白米飼雞鳩等作實騐而證明。其症狀爲頭痛，食慾銳退，嘔噁，不眠，下痢，便血及各種脚氣病之症狀等。</p>
<p>蓋米類內有人身健康上所需要之維他命甲乙丙。及鹽類，脂肪，蛋白質等重要之生活營養素。一經精碾。則此項要素。隨米糠及胚芽而俱去。含最寡少。不能維持健康矣。故滬上人士柔弱多病，過於鄕村居民。或謂係食用頭號白米所致。其言亦良足信矣。</p>
<h3>女子健美關鍵</h3>

<p>發育健全否？</p>
<p>心境鬱抑否？</p>
<p>經期準確否？</p>
<p>罹有隱病否？</p>
<p>蓋女子因環境與生理之不同。體質常較柔弱。心境最易鬱　。而白帶陰癢等隱病。及經前經後經多經少等痛苦。纏綿不休。健旣喪失。美於何有。</p>
<p>女用生殖素功能平肝去鬱。培補氣血。使身體與乳房。均得良好之發育。且有調經暖宮治病回春之效。故爲婦女及冬進補。獲得健美之無上聖品。如患有白帶等隱病者。外用「療帶靈」並治之尤佳。</p>
<h3>戒烟期內痛苦毫無</h3>

<h3>「華北的醜劇」</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>華北問题據說已吿一段落了，因爲冀察政委會現在已宣吿成立，某國人頗覺滿意。但是樂觀者雖大有其人，持反對態度的，却尙有一部分「不懂事」的靑年學生。然而這亦是無關緊要的。橫豎五省獨立，已縮成二省自治，勝利還是在這一方面。不過聽外人的批評，稱這把戲為「華北的醜劇」，倒不免有點那個。而且他們又指出這次登臺的人物，為××軍閥，與軍閥聯手的×外務省人員，軍閥所造成的人物，和跑龍套的中國自治派。中國自治派而曰「跑龍套」，這奚落更來得刻毒。其實從塲面上看，這一幕「醜劇」登臺扮演的角色，中國自治派原居主角的地位。說他們是「跑龍套」，不是外國人看不懂中國戲，便是有意侮辱。自然，要是這戲是「傀儡戲」，背後有人在拉綫，那就非我們所得而知的了。</p>
<p>好在這戲剛開塲，又有「跳加冠」登臺出來向觀衆宣佈主張，說今後凡關於排演和戲角，全以看客的意見為準則，看客喜歡就做，不喜歡就罷，决不有所違背。照此看來，倒也是公明正大的。不過我們覺得當這戲未上臺以前，大家都是極力制止其出演的。尤其是對於若干名角，更表示不滿。右是制止儘管制止，不滿儘管不滿，戲却一樣的做下去，而且做的頗熱鬧。所謂看客的意見云云，那只是一種冠冕堂皇的騙人話而已。</p>
<p>然而戲旣出塲了，高興看也吧，不高興看也吧。我們不管他們登臺的是大花的高視闊步，或是小丑的打科挿諢，排演的是失街亭，或是取成都，還是以一個觀衆的資格，在臺前來給他們嚴密監視一下。他們登臺的是忠臣，我們便拍拍掌贊賞一番。要是奸臣呢，就罵他幾句，或者索性把他打下臺去。我們千萬不要讓他們任意胡鬧一塲，連戲臺鬧翻了才是。但是担心的倒是他們在臺後會雇用幾個勇漢作保鑣，事情就棘手了。</p>
<p>近年來中國戲眞多，「滿洲戲」演完了，接着又演這幕「華北戲」，實在過於熱鬧。不知幾時才能停鑼息鼓呢？</p>
<h3>冬夜小吟</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>一　雨雪下</p>
<p>散佈着細雪花，混合了濛濛雨的黃昏，十一月的街衢，也同時散佈着無限的凄鬱味，趕過過的車輛是那樣匆忙的，步行者的足踪還是匆忙的，而車輛的背影很快地從雨雪籠罩着的陰閣的黃昏中消失了，人却遠遠地落後了。加緊了步子吧，再把脖子藏進高領里邊，可是路泥滑的，當心會不留神絆一交，於是不禁望着　茫的前程悵惘，心底有着異樣的焦急，爲什麽老走不上去呢，一個溫暖舒適的家屋不是在很近的地方等侯自己回來，怎的越走越覺得遼遠，彷彿彳亍在永恒的沒有守盡的時候的長途上。有了無名的悲哀之感了。雨雪是已經淋濕了滿身吧，也許是愈落愈有勁了。然而你是沒曾顧廬着，更也沒曾想到躱在店簷下暫避一陣，除了心里邊暗自的咒詛，只管冲向前，你是忘却了一切的念頭，只賸着一個單純的念頭——可愛的家屋呵，讓我膀下揷起隻翅卽刻飛上來，忽然你有着這樣奇蹟似的幻想了。</p>
<p>仿佛從一個世界投進另一個世界，當你踏上自己家屋的門檻時候，會不自一躍跳入去，稚氣地笑起來深深地呼吸了一口暖洋洋的空氣，吐出了適纔一胸腔的懊喪，迅速換上了衣服，渾身便透骨脊似的輕鬆了。</p>
<p>假如就踱到窗前去吧，回頭望望，對於送着你回來的雨雪下的凄迷的街景，繼續在你後面而來的步行者模糊的姿態，你是用着另一種完全。同的隔膜的情緒。去領略，和鑑賞的心境了。</p>
<p>到底有可愛的家深屋，美麗的季候終會等候着你。可是觳觫在街頭巷落間，在雨雪的侵襲下，眞是沒有家屋可逗縱的人的季候夢呢。就儘是伴着氷冷的風，瞧雨雪繽紛飄下，另後送迎着漫長的冬夜吧。</p>
<p>二　酒</p>
<p>在這樣冰桂凝結的日子，最使人感到親切的是一座比較淸靜的，而又生着爐火的宇舍，如可以鎭日價安閒地關伴在屋子內，讀一些心悅的卷籍，倦疲了便走上來踱踱，時間也狠容易馳過，况且的冬日是十分短促的。能够的話，你是再也不願意跨出門限一步的了。</p>
<p>而到了夜晚，寒氣也許更重些，喝一點酒煖煖身吧，想着，恰好酒的同伴門都來造訪了。於是準備着的酒一瓶瓶擺出來，菜肴輕便是不會妨礙一些兒酒興的，只是要有喝不完的酒。於是幾個人坐到火爐邊，一面緩緩地嚥着，一面烤火，一面絮談着。瞧着火爐里邊紅色火的舌熊熊地往上升，喝着，姿情地喝着紅色的葡萄酒連自己也不知道喝了多少，漸漸的臉孔也燒紅了。你所矜持的情感不由的突然散漫了，因為酒使你遺忘自己，也使你一時遺忘了傷感的心事。各自高聲笑著，說着，講出了秘密的戀史，但或者你的感情反而脆弱下來，低着首，悄悄地嘆息，因為別人的話無意挑燃你淡漢了的腿色的戀的記憶，於是大家會爲着你的太息而太息，然而當你忽又狂笑了，酒是叫你這樣淘氣呵。而酒是喝不完，話語也是豐富說不完的。護都陶醉了，屋子里充滿了浪笑艷言，心是飄然的，還牽掛着什麽呢，夫氣冷到手足都凍殭誰還想到，是冬天里的春天啊，你叫起來，挪棄了身外一切的事，不要醒轉吧，你甘願永遠沉在這境地黑，在冰月的日子，只有這樣的憧憬，頂能滿足自己。</p>
<h3>初雪</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>猛烈的西北風把那顆淡黃的太陽又吹去了，週遭冷得只是像浸在北極圈裏，村裏的幾條狗也早巳躱進了屋裏去，老母鷄却藏在柴堆中不敢出來。</p>
<p>霎時，天空中也在飄着鵝掌般的雪片了，像梅花瓣般地在空中飛着，飛到屋上，樹上，地上，漸漸地堆積起來。一羣失了歸宿的寒鴉只在那禿枝的疏林裏飛繞，噪叫。——</p>
<p>「雨雪連綿三九天，無柴無米苦黃連的天氣又到了，家裹如今已連了猪食豆也全已吃光，這三九嚴冬的日子正不知怎樣過」！三寳娘子坐在灶扉裹織着草鞋？望望天井裏飛着的烟一般的雪花嘆着冷氣，那張沒有表情的臉上巳罩上一層濃重的憂鬱。在她身傍地上遝爬着一個五六歲的孩子，他身上是綁着很厚的破棉花，綁得彷彿似一隻木猪；那雙凍得像紅蘿葡的骯髒小手，有一隻指頭伸在嘴裏不住地挖，眼淚和鼻涕在面上畫成了一張大花臉，已經分出界限了。在那個瘦削的輸廓裏祗有一對烏骨溜溜的眼珠子是活動的，然而一個又木又大的身體儘爬在地上打滾：「媽餓呀，媽，我要吃飯」！他這樣地哭叫着。</p>
<p>「咳飯，這樣的年勢，餓殺的日子在後頭啦」！她將那孩子一把從地上拖了起來說。這時三寶是喝得醉薰薰的從後門裹跌了進來，幾乎撞在孩子身上：</p>
<p>「毛頭，你，你又哭了……嗎」？他瞇着一雙花眼，嗡了鼻頭，二五不分的說着，一股極其難聞的酒氣直向他女人臉上嘖去；於是她就沒得好氣的對他恨恨地白了一眼，粗聲大氣的開口就駡：</p>
<p>「瘟殺的，你是開心咯，到那裏去祭飽了黃湯，家裹猪食豆也吃完了，我看你三九寒凍。怎樣打發過去，現在趁天氣還沒凍，不去想點事情來做，一天到晚只直僵僵的白相……」。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「什麽事，你去給我想！自己一天到晚織了幾雙草鞋，可曾賣得幾個錢呢！」他一壁回答着就在門檻上坐了下來，兩隻手却互相搓着。</p>
<p>「笑話，你男人家想不出法，倒來要女人替你去想法，眞是害臊也不怕的」！</p>
<p>「這年頭還有什麽害臊不害害臊：田給大水冲了收不着，工作找不到，反正餓死就在眼前」！他用力絞着作裙角，腦袋擱在門楞子上，睜着一雙沒神的眼睛。</p>
<p>天空中的雪是越下越利害了，並且那風也似乎比剛才大了些，門外那株古老的皂莢樹也給吹得呼呼地發叫，樹梢是不住地在空中捲着，烏鵲窠也差不多要給它撂下來了；兩隻鵲子却站在對面黃大爺的屋脊上叫個不休。</p>
<p>「咳！早晚總是一個餓死」！三寳忽地把一顆頭沉重地往前一衝，倒垂到了胸前，兩片眼皮也快闔上了；可是手裹却正拾起一根稻草芯在拗着，一段，二段，三段地落在地上，縱橫凌亂地躺着，正如他現在這心事一樣。（未完）</p>

<p>開篇「閨怨」</p>
<p>恨郎君蘭谷萍踪到處留。奴是琵琶春怨恨悠悠。看春風楊柳絲絲綠。敎奴舊恨親惑何日休。早難道。蝶夢已成秋扇怨。歌塲春色等虛浮。今日裏空門淚影靑燈裏。失足恨長留萬古羞。啼笑姻緣原是假。痴心何必再追求。情塲失戀悔初志。反不如鷄鴨夫妻共白頭。到如今雨過天靑方質悉。故都春夢醒荘周。想昔日芭蕉葉詩猶在。說什麼野草閑花不再留。有知都會早晨城市夜。見他依然與三個摩登女郎比肩遊。全無人道背天理。近與那南海美人共泛舟。想奴是空谷蘭香惟自惜。孤軍絕援與誰謀。而今寄跡紅蓮寺。好一似大海狂流一葉舟。野玫瑰　儂忍耐待。不然是。已將聽得。鷄唱　聲報曉籌。可憐。淚珠兒濕透翠紗　。</p>

<p>春江花月最繁華。月映花牆花月偕。花愛月明花愛月。月移花影月移花。花開待月琴停響。月裹　花鼓亂撾。滿地落花金　字。一鈎新月玉了又。花花世界春常在。月月潮頭信不差。皓月一輪修玉斧。梅花三弄撥銅琶。江郎夢繞生花筆。張子游仙泛月槎。面似桃花眉如月。水中明月鏡中花。好憑月老傳鴛牒。爲倩花奴拾鳳釵。拜月焚香情正切。葬花　玉恨無涯。荻花秋月潯陽客。孤月梅花處士家。月殿掃興鸞尾帶。花階立月鳳頭鞋。水中撈月空成話。霧裏看花興自佳。梁月懷人悲月榭。簪花及第步大街。素娥桂月宮中住。玉女菱花鏡裹揩。欲捲珠簾籠夜月。爲刪惡竹灌名花。落花啼嗚春愁水。斜月殘燈夜夢賒。月裏種花防雨妬。花間漏月藉雲遮。花叢酌酒遊蜂舞。月窟吹簫引鳳諧。月作重衾花作枕。花爲四壁月爲家。天花亂墜迷花影。秋月常圓看月華。冷月殘風春寂</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>文化影業公司的「父母子女將從元旦起在金城公映了，這是一個完全「新人」製成的作品，值得我們另眼相看的。（一說「凱歌」亦將於元旦公映，待證。）</p>
<p>際此老將們走的走了，死的死了的時候，電影圈眞是大有成為死城的危險，要沒有好好的新人出來作為主力軍，你說，如何呌老弱殘兵們守得住？</p>
<p>「父母子女」的導演者胡心靈君很年靑，據說「父母子女」這個戲也「相當」好，（是否眞好，讓看了再說實話，現在祇好姑且說「相當」兩字。）而胡婚拉紗童子胡蓉蓉的戲，也「相當」好之。希望這些都是事實。</p>
<p>據說繼學生運動之後，將有電影界請願團了。這消息來得突兀，我們拭目以覩究竟可也。</p>
<p>或曰；電影界請願團如果是包括男女明星而言，則相信如果到南京去請願，他的待遇將異於學生。此說有些近乎呼說八道，相應不理。</p>
<h3>袁美雲和王引之「花燭之夜」</h3>
<h3>「小覇王」將公映</h3>
<p>詹姆士賈克奈又一新作</p>
<p>自「一身是膽」後，詹姆士賈克奈接連着主演了好幾部片子，但在這許多片子當中，要讓最近的一部「小霸王」Frisco　Kid（這片子巳定於大除夕晚塲在大光明獻映。）最令人滿意了。這部「小覇王」，是叙述十八世紀時候，在舊金山的某一個野蠻區域裏，沒有法律，沒有文化，全城充滿着橫暴的强徒，殺人放火，不算一回事，　欠的小覇王，就在那個時候應運而生，在他的嘴唇上，是沾着女人的胭脂，在他的拳頭上，却染着敵人的鮮血。詹姆士賈克奈，在本片裏扮演這樣一個角色，當然是非常適合他的個性，片中危險塲面極多，自始至終，沒有一點鬆懈的地方，道的確是很難得的。</p>
<h3>「凱歌」攝製時的幾樁辛苦事</h3>
<p>一部影片的完成，眞不知要耗費多少人的心血和精神，特別是「凱歌」，它確眞遭遇了不少次的困難，現在就讓我來談些攝製時幾樁辛苦事，也算是備忘。</p>
<p>「凱歌」的開工是遠在年前的一個寒冷的冬天，因為劇情是以旱災做背景，故祇好先從內景方面着手，但是天氣寒冷襲人，雖然燈光加强，但演員在一件單薄衣下演戲，仍無一不凍得嘴唇皮發紫，秦桐甚至害起病來。</p>
<p>內景拍完時，已是炎熱的夏天了，一行人在浙江諸曁潘家埠拍了二十五天的外景，歸來時每個人都變成黑炭，並因蚊子兇毒如虎，竟有七八個人一連臥倒病床月餘始起。</p>
<p>到蘇州拍荷花池一幕時，已是殘秋，大地雖尙有餘熱，可是　蔭下的荷花池已寒冷如冰，攝影師吳蔚云與助手王春泉赤裸在池中工作一天，歸來時已受寒氣所襲了。</p>
<p>拍開壩一塲戲時，適遇演員都要赤身裸腿，可是這時候正是北風橫刮的嚴冬，其痛苦之狀，實非筆墨所能形容。</p>
<p>總括地說，「凱歌」的攝製，眞不知吃盡了多少的苦頭，上面所述，也不外是其中的一部份而已。</p>

<h3>Resolving the Hebei-East Problem: Divergent Opinions among All Parties; Doihara Flies to Shanghai, Guandong Army Holds Meeting; Negotiation Key Lies in This Trip</h3>
<p>Beiping: After negotiations on the Hebei-East problem began in Tianjin, opinions among various parties have gradually converged, but have not yet reached a consensus. Therefore, there are still no concrete results at this moment. Because various issues require detailed discussion, it may take a relatively long time to resolve them. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the three issues of Hebei-East, Chahar-North, and Tanggu, related parties have been working hard in Tianjin for several days to negotiate. Doihara, who had been staying in Beiping for a long time, flew to Changchun yesterday afternoon, accompanied by several people. It is said that the key to the negotiations lies in the outcome of Doihara's trip to Changchun. Doihara and others are scheduled to stay in Changchun for a week before returning to Beiping and Tianjin. According to foreign sources, Doihara will soon have a new appointment and will be stationed in Tianjin for a long time. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Doihara left Tianjin by plane at noon on the 26th and returned to Shenyang. At 11 o'clock that night, he changed to the Shenyang-Changchun train to go to Changchun to meet with Commander-in-Chief of the Guandong Army, Minami Jiro, to report on the Hebei-East, Chahar-East, and Tanggu incidents. He will return to Tianjin in a week to continue discussions. Matsui Gennosuke, the Japanese military attaché in Chahar, is scheduled to leave Tianjin on the 29th aboard the Changjiang Maru to return to Japan and take up a position as a military professor at Hiroshima University of Literature and Science. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the negotiation of various issues in Hebei-East, Chahar-East, and Tanggu, since Doihara flew to Changchun, the general public believes that Doihara's trip is of great significance. Therefore, the development of the negotiations will officially proceed after Doihara returns. It is rumored that the Japanese Guandong Army will give Doihara a new position so that he can be stationed in Beiping and Tianjin to facilitate contact and communication. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch) Changchun: Major General Doihara, head of the Shenyang Japanese Special Service Agency, arrived in Changchun at 7:00 AM today. At 10:00 AM, he discussed North China countermeasures after the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee with Chief of Staff Nishio, Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki, and others in the second conference room of the Guandong Army Headquarters. The meeting continued in the afternoon. (27th Hualian Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to sources, in order to resolve the Hebei-East problem, both sides are in the initial stage of contact in Tianjin. Because there is still a significant difference in opinions between each other, it is necessary to conduct thorough research and make a principle decision before formal discussions can be held. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch) Tokyo: Colonel Kita, the head of the China Section of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, who returned to Japan after inspecting North China, visited the Minister of the Army at the Minister's official residence in Nagatacho at 2:00 PM today. After reporting on the inspection in detail, an important meeting was held. (27th Hualian Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan told reporters here today that the negotiations to resolve the Hebei-East and Chahar-East problems are progressing smoothly. The Japanese side has stated that it will not interfere in China's internal affairs. Doihara will travel to Changchun within a few days to meet with officials of the Guandong Army, and a final solution will be reached soon. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiaozuo Students Stop in Xuzhou to Request Instructions</h3>

The Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters also sent Chief of Political Training Fang Jikuan and Deputy Adjutant Wen to persuade them. The students lay down on the tracks to demand a train, causing all trains leaving Xuzhou last night to fail to pass. Secretary Zhou, dispatched by the Ministry of Education, arrived at Sanbu to offer condolences. Shen Entao from the Jinpu Railway Bureau also went to intercept and guide them. Zhou allowed the students to send a telegram to the Central Government to petition. The students then cancelled their action of lying down on the tracks, but demanded to wait for a reply in Sanbu.

<p>Kaifeng: Students from Bian University went to the provincial government at 9:00 AM on the 26th to petition, demanding that they ask the Railway Bureau for a train to transport them to Beijing. Secretary-General Fang Qidao received them and told them that the provincial government did not have this authority, and advised the students to concentrate on their studies. The students then requested that if they directly asked the Railway Bureau for a train, please order the military and police not to interfere. They then received a satisfactory reply, and immediately marched towards the railway station in formation, in high spirits and good order. After arriving at the station, they negotiated with the stationmaster for a train, and the stationmaster agreed to telegraph the Ministry of Railways to ask for instructions. Just as the eastbound passenger and freight train had not yet departed, the students detained it. Several representatives lay on the tracks. All subsequent passenger and freight trains arriving after 12:00 PM were unable to depart. The area near the station was filled with male and female students waiting for the train to go east. Now there are no trains coming from either the east or the west, and traffic is completely cut off. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xuzhou: The petitioning students of Jiaozuo Institute of Technology returned to Xuzhou from Sanbu this afternoon and gathered at the Garrison Headquarters. Huang Jie and Zhou Gan, a representative dispatched by the Ministry of Education, both addressed the students. The students put forward eight petitioning opinions, which Huang and Zhou jointly telegraphed to the Central Government to present on their behalf. After the reply arrives, the Longhai Railway will prepare a train to send the students back west. The students' behavior is very calm. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Unfolding of the British-American Monetary War</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In recent two weeks, the United States has reduced its silver purchases in London, causing the world silver price to plummet. The monetary war between Britain and the United States has once again attracted attention.</p>
<p>The monetary war is a means of competing for commodity markets. Its occurrence between Britain and the United States began in October 1931 when Britain banned the export of gold, suspended the gold standard, and lowered the exchange rate to promote foreign trade and encroach on the American commodity market. In April 1933, the United States also suspended the gold standard and devalued its currency to compete with the British pound. After the World Economic Conference, the monetary war between the two countries became more intense. Britain formed a huge group to control the finances of some related countries, while the United States, in addition to using a huge equalization fund for exchange rate dumping, also implemented a national silver policy to increase the silver price and buy a large amount of silver, intending to increase the purchasing power of countries with silver standards and gold exchange standards and control their monetary power.</p>
<p>However, the result of the implementation of the silver policy not only failed to increase the purchasing power of countries with silver standards and gold exchange standards, but also gave Britain the opportunity to expand the gold pound group. The rise in silver prices caused great harm to silver-using countries. On November 4th, our country was forced to reform its currency system, internally implementing legal tender and externally controlling foreign exchange, and stipulating that the legal tender exchange rate should be one yuan of legal tender equals one shilling and two and a half pence of British gold. The United States was deeply afraid that the largest market in the Far East would be swept away by the British pound. Therefore, taking advantage of our country's sale of silver reserves in London to provide the three banks with resources to purchase foreign exchange, it temporarily suspended silver purchases in London to attack the British pound group. On December 10th, Thomas, the leader of the American silver faction, publicly attacked Britain, accusing Britain of wanting to link our country's currency with the British pound. Since then, although the United States has continued to purchase silver in London, the quantity has been greatly reduced. In the past two weeks, the silver price has fallen by eight pence, and the difference between the British exchange parity and the exchange rate is only three and a half pence. The cash concentrated by our government, originally intended to provide the three banks with resources to purchase foreign exchange, has inevitably seen a sharp contraction in value as a result. This is the impact of the recent unfolding of the British-American monetary war on our country's currency system.</p>
<p>Now, the financial authorities of our country, in view of this, have been paying attention to whether the ratio of legal tender to the British pound will rise and fall with the world silver price, and are preparing to cope with it. This issue is extremely complex and difficult to make a clear review here. However, what we can say with certainty is that in order to achieve the restoration of the national economy, we must allow our country's currency system to break away from the vortex of the competition between the US dollar and the British pound.</p>
<h3>The National Government Orders the Allocation of Funeral Expenses for Tang Youren</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government issued an order on the 27th stating that Tang Youren, the former Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, had broad knowledge and was courageous in taking on responsibilities.

He was currently transferred to the position of Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, where he was expected to be able to provide assistance.

Tang Youren is to be given 3,000 yuan for funeral expenses, and the Examination Yuan is to be instructed to transfer it to the Ministry of Personnel for preferential treatment to recognize his merits.

<h3>Yang Yongtai Flies from Nanjing to Hubei to Take Office</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The newly appointed Chairman of Hubei Province, Yang Yongtai, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by the JianGuo ship on the morning of the 27th. He visited President Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions, and then flew to Wuhan to take office. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zou Lu and Others Return to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Zou Lu, Liu Luyin, Li Wenfan, and Mai Huanzhang arrived in Hong Kong on the President Garland at noon on the 27th, and returned to the province by car on the morning of the 28th. Zou issued a written statement, stating that during his stay in Beijing for more than 40 days, he felt that the spirit of unity was strengthened and that they were working together to overcome national difficulties, and that considerable results had been achieved. For example, Chiang's personal appointment as the President of the Executive Yuan is one example. If he were not confident, Chiang would not have done this. Because after becoming the President of the Executive Yuan, it is our ardent hope that he will be able to handle the national crisis. If he fails, he will personally take the blame. Therefore, the previous national affairs were in a dead end, and today's national affairs have entered a living end. The former government's handling of the student patriotic movement failed to fully comply with the purpose of working together to overcome national difficulties, and I have not criticized them deeply, because asking a chef to cook a meal also requires time to buy firewood and rice, fetch water, and wash the pot before it can be done. Regarding the selection of personnel for various departments of the Executive Yuan, I have no criticism, because if there is already a head chef, then let him find his own assistants. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Diplomacy: Fate of Cabinet Hangs by a Thread; Party Leaders Speak for One Hour; Laval Summarizes Recent Situation Today</h3>
<p>Paris: After party leaders agreed not to vote until 4:00 PM tomorrow, Socialist leader Blum began the crucial defense regarding the diplomatic events in the Chamber of Deputies today, speaking for an hour. Reynaud and Taittinger also spoke for one hour each. Prime Minister Laval will address the Chamber tomorrow. Based on the latest situation, Laval can obtain a majority of 40 votes in the vote of confidence. Laval, in answering a question from a member of the Chamber today, stated that France would provide naval, land, and air support to Britain if Italy attacked Britain. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to begin discussing the government's foreign policy at 3:00 PM today, and it is expected to adjourn at 9:00 PM. It will continue to meet tomorrow afternoon. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will answer questions raised by the members of parliament around 3:00 PM tomorrow. Therefore, a final decision on this matter will be reached around 4:00 PM tomorrow. Political observers believe that although Laval will win the vote of confidence tomorrow, it will be after a heated debate. The fate of the cabinet depends on the attitude of the Radical Socialist Party. In any case, the speech that Prime Minister Laval intends to deliver tomorrow will be a crucial factor in determining the overall situation. However, the content of the speech is still unknown at this time. In short, the fate of the cabinet will depend on the situation at tomorrow's meeting. All speculations at this time are premature. The opinions among the members of the Radical Party are also mutually inconsistent. They held a meeting in the Chamber of Deputies lounge this morning, and heated debates occurred between the pro-government faction and the left-wing elements. This shows that the party's attitude towards foreign policy is also very uncertain. What is known is that two opposition members are scheduled to speak, including former Aviation Minister Cot, who will undoubtedly criticize the government's foreign policy at that time. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris: The cabinet today passed Prime Minister Laval's draft speech to the Chamber of Deputies defending his foreign policy. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris: The fate of the Laval government is once again in flux. In today's debate in the Chamber of Deputies on diplomatic events, even a minor incident could be the deciding factor. It is reported that Laval will give a speech today defending his foreign policy, especially focusing on the principles he adopted when negotiating the Paris Peace Plan with former British Foreign Secretary Hoare. Laval must win the vote of confidence in order to continue to hold office. Although Laval can win a small majority in this vote, his victory is still uncertain because Laval currently disagrees with Édouard Herriot, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party. The differences between the two men have not been resolved, so Herriot may not necessarily have his comrades support Laval today. The cabinet held a meeting yesterday, chaired by the President. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that Prime Minister Laval had reported on the diplomatic situation. Judging from the tone of the communiqué, the cabinet does not fully agree with Laval's foreign policy. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Radical Party Discusses Attitude Towards Foreign Policy: Government Can Get Thirty More Votes</h3>
<p>Paris: The parliamentary group of the Radical Socialist Party held a meeting this morning to discuss the attitude that the party should take on foreign policy. Opponents believe that the government can get about thirty more votes on this issue and predict that the number of abstentions will be high. Therefore, of the 612 members of the Chamber of Deputies, less than 300 will vote in favor of the government. Government officials believe that the government can obtain a majority of about 50 votes. The Chamber of Deputies will meet at 3:00 PM today, with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval giving a speech first, followed by a foreign policy debate. After the Prime Minister, the speakers are scheduled to be Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party, and Dayen, an important figure on the right. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Begins Discussion on Extending Military Service Period; Minister of War Announces Comparison of French and German Strength</h3>
<p>Paris: Former Prime Minister Flandin submitted a draft law to the parliament earlier this year requesting that the period of military service for the people be increased from 18 months to two years. Later, Flandin resigned due to an incident, and this case was postponed until now before the Chamber of Deputies began discussing it. Right-wing members have proposed an amendment arguing that the military service period for the eldest son of families with five children should be reduced. If this measure is implemented, the number of soldiers in the French army will be reduced by 16,000. Minister of War Fabry immediately expressed his disagreement, saying that France could not reduce the number of soldiers under the current circumstances, and proposed a vote of confidence. Fabry's move was unexpected and opposed by most members, and the cabinet almost collapsed because of it. If this vote of confidence were put to a vote, most right-wing and centrist members would join the opposition. The Chamber of Deputies then adjourned for a moment, and the cabinet was able to survive the crisis. After the resumption of the meeting, the government, realizing that the situation was unfavorable, accepted the referral of the amendment to the Military Affairs Committee for review. Beforehand, Minister of War Fabry declared, "Germany has 800,000 active soldiers, while France has only 400,000 within its own borders, including all the troops protecting the border defenses to prevent German invasion. The comparison between the two is really dwarfed." Fabry then protested against the Communist Party's organization of anti-fascist defense groups in various barracks and the promotion of anti-militarism. At this point, the Communist Party members expressed their dissatisfaction. Fabry then said, "I have instructed all military commanders to punish those who engage in political or religious propaganda in the army. I have also decided to prohibit all propaganda, especially anti-militarism propaganda, because it has a revolutionary nature." Fabry also said that the French professional army currently has 115,000 members and is expected to increase to 117,000 members soon. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>San Francisco: California Mobil Oil Company today denied that it had any business relationship with Italy or Ethiopia, and said that the refinery to be built on Balun Island in the Persian Gulf has been planned for many years. Only 6.5% of the oil used by Italy is supplied by the United States. It was recently rumored that Italy had signed an agreement with an Italian subsidiary of New Jersey Mobil Oil Company, stipulating that if the League of Nations implemented an oil embargo, the company would supply as much as possible, and the refinery on Balun Island would be the source of the oil. Today's statement by the company may be a denial of the above rumor. (26th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>The National Bank of France</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the political situation in France has largely hinged on financial matters, and the biggest problem in finance has been the austerity policy and the maintenance of the gold standard. In late May of this year, Prime Minister Flandin had to resign because the Chamber of Deputies refused to grant him economic dictatorial powers. His successor, Pucheu, also stepped down for the same reason after only four days in office. It was not until June 7th that Laval took on the difficult task and was able to gain the trust of the Chamber of Deputies. In fact, Laval's demands were almost exactly the same as Flandin's original demands, both of which were that the government should be able to maintain the gold standard of the franc by decree, and to do everything possible to prevent currency inflation and currency devaluation speculation. However, even though Laval had gained the trust of the parliament, cash still flowed out in large quantities whenever the political situation shifted, so we often saw the National Bank of France raising the discount rate to prevent this.</p>
<p>We must realize that the National Bank of France is now at the center of French politics. In recent days, French cash has been flowing out steadily again, so that the discount rate has been raised from 3% to 6% in two weeks. There may be drastic changes in the political situation soon. How things will develop in the future is of course difficult to predict now, but if we examine the organization and background of the National Bank, we can get a clearer picture of the inside story of French politics. And the reasons for future changes can also be traced.</p>
<p>The National Bank of France was founded by Napoleon in 1800. For more than 130 years, it has undergone many changes in its political system, including three invasions by strong neighbors. In 1871, the headquarters in Paris was even ruled by the Communist Party. However, the organizational system of the National Bank, and even the figures in power, have always remained the same as in Napoleon's time. This spring, it became openly involved in the political vortex. And the Laval government's austerity policy was also an indirect result of this bank's interference in politics.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party is very dissatisfied with the National Bank. They say that the National Bank is infringing on the sovereignty of the people and the will of the state, and is a financial oligarchy. The board of directors of the National Bank is an organ that controls national politics. However, the directors of the bank are calm and say: "We have saved the position of the franc in the most critical times. We have also preserved the wealth of the country and prevented financial panic. If this is called exercising power and manipulating politics, then we should do more of it."</p>
<p>In fact, the National Bank of France is a limited liability company established by the state. All 182,500 shares in the company are in private hands, and the government does not own a single share. The government appoints a president and two vice presidents. The bank is the agent of the Ministry of Finance and the only institution that issues currency. Napoleon said: "I want the National Bank to be controlled by the president, but not too much." This is the original intention of the mutual restraint.</p>
<p>Shareholders must be French citizens. The 200 shareholders with the most shares are eligible to attend the shareholders' meeting. However, regardless of the number of shares, each person has only one vote. The shareholders' meeting elects 15 directors and 3 supervisors. The executive committee, composed of the directors, supervisors, and the president and vice presidents, is the center that holds all the power of the bank. The president must have at least 100 shares, the vice president must have 50 shares, and there is no limit to the term of office. Directors must have at least 30 shares, but in fact, they now need to have 85 shares to be eligible to attend the shareholders' meeting. At least five of the directors must be industrialists or merchants, three must be officials from the Ministry of Finance, and although there are no other regulations, most of them are bankers.</p>
<p>According to the bank's report last year, the total number of shareholders was 41,668. On the surface, it seems that so many shareholders, distributing 182,500 shares, should not have room for manipulation. However, after careful investigation, the shareholders with only one or two shares, three or five shares, account for more than 35,000 people. There are only 363 people with 50 or more shares. According to the bank's articles of association, only the 200 shareholders with the most shares are allowed to attend the shareholders' meeting. Then, naturally, you must have more than 85 shares to have this qualification.</p>
<p>When the bank was first established, the face value of the shares was 1,000 francs per share. Later, the value gradually increased, and the highest it reached was 23,000 francs. Although it has fallen sharply now, it is still around 10,000 francs. Therefore, to attend the shareholders' meeting, you must first invest 850,000 francs. (Equivalent to about 190,000 yuan in national currency) to be eligible for election. Since the qualifications are so strict, the 200 shareholders in this meeting have naturally become the largest economic force in France. Moreover, many shareholders' shares are family assets, passed down from generation to generation, and rarely transferred. What's more, the dozen or so directors are simply like hereditary titles. Opening the reports over the years, you always see these dozen or so names. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, they cannot be listed here one by one. In short, they are all the leaders of French capitalists, and they are all people who are related to each other and communicate with each other.</p>
<p>A French journalist once carefully studied the real power of the twelve directors. According to his investigation, their names appear on the boards of directors of 96 large companies in France, occupying a total of 150 seats. Those large companies are 35 banks, 8 insurance companies, 9 railway companies, 8 shipping companies, 7 metallurgical companies, 6 electrical companies, 8 mining companies, 12 chemical companies, and 7 other companies. They have deep relationships with each other in the national financial and industrial circles. Therefore, in the board of directors of the National Bank, they also have similar ideas and are not afraid of others encroaching on their power. Although it is said that the president and vice presidents are appointed by the government and may have some restraints, the president must have at least 100 shares. In other words, you must have 1 million francs in assets. Originally, people with money would certainly not oppose the board of directors. Some presidents, after taking office, even have to find ways to borrow money, or borrow the name of shares, and most of the shares are in the hands of the directors. As a result, there is often a debt relationship between the president and the directors. As a result, the president still breathes through the same nostril as the board of directors.</p>
<p>All the claims of the capitalists are certainly not agreed upon by the left-leaning parties. France has experienced four years of economic decline, and the people have suffered hardships. The Laval government's austerity policy, especially the reduction of salaries, has aroused opposition from all sides. In the eyes of radicals, Laval is nothing more than a tool of the National Bank. The condition for him to become prime minister is to completely obey the board of directors of the National Bank.</p>
<p>Whether this situation of capitalists controlling things should be supported is now indeed a question. Whether future governments will still respect the power of the National Bank is also unpredictable. Of course, France must have a National Bank. However, the current organization has not changed for 135 years. Whether it is still suitable for the national conditions of France. The answers to these questions are eagerly awaited by the world.</p>

<h3>After Our Country Solves the Currency Problem, the United States Will Raise the Price of Silver Again and Wants to Stop the Japanese from Smuggling Chinese Silver. Pittman Is Satisfied with the Ministry of Finance's Silver Purchase Method</h3>
<p>London, Financial Times, New York dispatch says that according to a statement from the US Treasury Department, the US government may resume its efforts to raise the world price of silver after China solves its most urgent currency problems. At the same time, the US government wants to stop the smuggling of Chinese silver to help China implement its policy of nationalizing silver. The US Treasury Department will then try to negotiate an agreement with China to stipulate the future status of silver in China's economic organization. The United States will also encourage Mexico and other countries with large supplies of silver to adopt a currency reserve of half gold and half silver. The United States is prepared to supply these countries with gold to exchange for silver, so as to achieve the extent that the negotiated plan can be put into practice. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>New York, Wall Street Journal, Washington dispatch says that the restoration of the World Bank under the auspices of the US Treasury Department will obviously depend on the progress of China's silver nationalization plan and the results of future negotiations between China and the United States. The US Treasury Department's permission for the price of silver to fall is obviously a kind of pressure move to make it no longer profitable for the Japanese to smuggle Chinese silver, and to end it. Once this plan is successful, and China has time to implement its necessary currency reform policies, the US Treasury Department can raise the price of silver again, but beforehand, it may try to establish an agreement or understanding on the future of silver as China's currency. (26th Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Silver Investigation Committee, said today that he supports the Treasury Department's measures in the world silver market. The path taken by the Treasury Department because of exchange rate relations is of course. I am satisfied with the implementation of the silver purchase plan by Treasury Secretary H. H. Kung. As for China, it will eventually restore the silver standard. He did not see that the next Congress will propose important silver laws. Pittman continued, he expected that after the European situation is calm, the world's currency can be stabilized immediately. But Pittman did not want to say when it can be stabilized, but when governments are preparing for war and creating proposals for stabilization, it is futile. Pittman also said that the Treasury Department purchases an average of 50 million ounces of silver per month, which is more than before the current silver law was passed. The large influx of foreign gold is only a temporary phenomenon. After the world currency is stabilized, this gold and silver will still flow out of the country. However, this hard currency is quite valuable for the United States to negotiate a stable monetary system in the future. Pittman also commented on China's currency problem, and his tone was very pessimistic, saying that China's managed currency will fail. Chinese people only know how to use silver coins and doubt paper money. The situation in South America is also the same. Whether these countries restore the gold standard or not, they must have a large amount of silver. Once the time for currency stabilization is ripe, the United States will supply their central banks with reserves. China's recent silver panic was partly due to the National Government's announcement of an embargo and nationalization of silver. As a result, money was saved and smuggled out of the country. The rise and fall of silver prices is harmful to US-China trade, but China should be satisfied with the fall in silver prices. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington, the monthly report published by the Federal Reserve Board today stated that from November 10th to December 5th this year, the United States imported a total of $766,000,000 worth of gold. The reasons are as follows: 　The European situation has caused floating funds to move to New York. 　Foreigners buy US securities. This shows that foreign investors generally believe that investing in the US market is beneficial. 　The capital of the gold group countries is most easily affected by national budgets and political situations.

<p>Washington, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently made remarks about Japan that caused a sensation for a while. Today, he said that what was published in the newspapers has not been able to convey his meaning, so he still intends to speak in the Senate soon to answer Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito's statement that "the American people should not pay attention to his remarks." After Pittman's last speech, he was interviewed by the press and reiterated his words, but today's tone has changed slightly. He said, "What I discussed in La Vegas was the current military government of Japan, which clearly wants to control East Asia, and then expand to the Pacific Islands. If the military government's ambitions are not curbed and can continue to hold power, then this ambition will still expand, and the United States may not be able to find ways to protect its own people and other people who rely on the protection of the United States."

<h3>Christmas This Year Is the Most Depressing. Observations of the Roman Curia</h3>
<p>Vatican, the Curia's organ newspaper "Roman Observer" recently commented on the current situation, saying, "Europe is passing Christmas in an unstable state. Generally, people do not make compromises, and we have not seen the possibility of establishing a compromise. Since the European War, Christmas this year has been the most depressing. If the future of Europe is not based on abstract empty words, but wants to rely on concrete facts, then the review of the current situation should take the speech made by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the British House of Commons as its starting point. Sir Halifax, Kai Che Chen, is not ambiguous, and this is called by the Italian newspapers as "a straightforward and sympathetic person." As for the suggestions made by Britain and France, although they are said to have died in Britain, they still exist in France and the League of Nations. For now, it is best to bring up old things again." (26th Havas)</p>
<h3>Most Countries Agree with the UK on the Issue of International Mutual Assistance</h3>
<p>London, the British government recently inquired about the attitudes of Mediterranean countries on the issue of mutual assistance in accordance with the League of Nations Treaty. It has now received satisfactory replies from France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, and other countries, promising to abide by the provisions of Article 16, Section 3 of the League of Nations Covenant and fulfill its obligations when Italy attacks any country that implements sanctions. In other words, this reply is a reaffirmation of the resolution passed in Geneva this autumn. This language should not be confused with the issue of military trials. Military sanctions are entirely another matter. In the future, if it proves necessary to have mutual assistance actions, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean will be implemented in the same way. Spain will probably also declare its attitude on the issue of mutual assistance, but the British government has not formally inquired about it, only had informal discussions. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>Delhi, the cabinet recently discussed Spain's position on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, especially the issue of naval mutual assistance proposed by the United Kingdom. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Temple Fortune made a statement to the press, saying, "What the cabinet discussed is purely an international issue. It is not convenient to announce anything at this time. A declaration will be issued next Tuesday." According to reports, the British government raised questions to Yugoslavia, Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Spain at the beginning of this month, asking whether these countries would be prepared to provide assistance if the British navy was attacked in the Mediterranean. The four countries of South, Greece, Turkey, and Romania gave satisfactory answers. As for Spain, because British Foreign Secretary Eden had discussed this matter with Spanish representative to the League of Nations Madariaga, but did not directly make any request, it was unable to submit a reply. What was discussed at today's cabinet meeting was how to answer this question. (26th Havas)</p>
<h3>Rome Still Has Diplomatic Contacts. French Ambassador Cancels Trip to Paris</h3>
<p>Rome, although diplomatic circles have stopped activities due to the holidays, an Associated Press reporter learned today that a secret contact is currently underway in this question. The content of this development is still difficult to confirm, but diplomatic circles believe that the sudden cancellation of the French Ambassador Deschamps's trip to Paris for the Christmas holiday is very important. The diplomatic efforts of important government officials are also very obvious, but large-scale diplomatic negotiations will not resume until the beginning of next year. At that time, the new British Foreign Secretary Eden will be the protagonist. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome, Italian newspapers are still launching large-scale attacks on Britain today, and quoted a military expert as saying that the offensive of the Ethiopian army on the northern front is also affected by Britain. Britain clearly hopes that the Italian army will fail, so that it will not need to expand the scope of sanctions against Italy. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome, the "Tribune" newspaper recently stated, "British policy has been determined to step into the path of extreme sanctionism. However, whether French policy will form an anti-Italian group with Britain is something that Italian public opinion has the right to ask." A few days ago, the executive department of the United Federation of Veteran Soldiers of the French Left decided to declare that if any country goes to war with Italy, it would be like a disaster within the walls. The association will never allow France to send a single soldier to participate in this war. The "Tribune" criticized this declaration, "France has never been afraid of fighting in the past, and there is no difficulty now. However, France believes that if the resolutions adopted by the League of Nations are interpreted with ulterior motives and unfavorable to Italy, and if this interpretation is supported to cause a conflict in Europe, it would be a great evil, because once a war starts, the disaster it will cause will be unimaginable." (27th Havas)</p>
<p>Rome, after the failure of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute solution proposed by Britain and France, the semi-official Italian newspaper "Italian Daily" recently commented again, "Italy was unable to accept this plan directly for four reasons. Some parts of Ethiopia have been influenced by Italian culture for more than 50 years, and there is no possibility of ceding them to Ethiopia. Although Aksum City is a holy city in Ethiopia, the Italian army has liberated slaves and established hospitals after occupying it, and it is not convenient to return it to Ethiopia. The British and French proposals advocate ceding the barren lands of the Donakil and Ogaden regions to Italy, which Italy cannot accept. Regarding the British and French proposals on Italian colonies, they have failed to provide practical guarantees for Italian immigrants and their interests." Moreover, the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian Treaty and the 1925 Anglo-Italian Agreement were both registered with the League of Nations, and the benefits they gave to Italy were far greater than the British and French proposals in Paris. (26th Havas)</p>
<p>Vienna, the "Teutonic News Agency" reported today that 1,650 people of Teutonic descent within Italy have fled to Germany to avoid being drafted into the Ethiopian army.

<h3>Anglo-German Negotiations Haven't Occurred: The Issue of the Sky Treaty; German Side Denies British Ambassador Met with Hitler</h3>
<p>Paris: Although the British Embassy in Germany has denied that Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, met with German Chancellor Hitler on December 20 for discussions, a diplomatic correspondent for the paper "L'Intransigeant" has confirmed this. It is reported that when Hitler met with Phipps on December 13, he expressed that before the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was resolved, it was not appropriate for Britain and Germany to conclude a bilateral sky treaty. However, during their second meeting on the 20th, he did present the British Ambassador with a draft agreement on this matter, although the details of its contents are not yet known. Regarding the limitation of German army strength, "L'Intransigeant" understands that Hitler also told the British Ambassador on the 13th that Germany would refuse to consider this issue until its pre-war colonies were returned and Britain acknowledged that Germany was not solely responsible for the start of World War I. (Havas News Agency, December 27)</p>
<p>Berlin: The French newspaper "L'Intransigeant" reported that when Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, visited Chancellor Hitler on December 20, Hitler presented him with a draft agreement on a bilateral Anglo-German sky treaty. This claim has now been denied by the semi-official German News Agency. The agency stated that, according to official announcements, the British Ambassador did not meet with the Chancellor on that day. Furthermore, the newspaper's claim that the British Ambassador had a meeting with the Chancellor on December 13 is also groundless. (Havas, December 27)</p>
<p>Berlin: In June of this year, Britain and Germany concluded a naval agreement.

These provisions place considerable emphasis on the defensive capabilities of aircraft. (National Telegram, December 26)</p>

<p>Kong Xiangrong Arrives in Jinan to Discuss: River Blocking Project to be Completed Soon</p>
<p>Jinan: Kong Xiangrong arrived in Jinan at 8:30 PM on the 26th. He has been inspecting the Dongzhuang construction site, as well as the Su Feng diversion dam head and Zhengzhou, for several days regarding the situation of the construction sites. Because the main flow directly hits the Jiangsu dam head, the dam head has been extended by more than fifty feet, deep into the river. Also, the four diversion dams below the Jiangsu dam have taken effect, so the flow is gradually shifting north. In addition, within the main river near Li Sheng Village, a cutting-angle diversion project is being carried out, and the Jiangsu dam is being extended. The new dike is being continuously built to the riverbank. Although it is cold, work is still being done to complete it before the ice run, as a base for the western dam. When the ice run period arrives, the power of the ice water rise will be used to divert the flow into the main river, reducing the amount of water flowing out of the breach. Then, opportunities will be seized to advance and close the eastern and western dams. Regarding materials, an additional 10,000 cubic meters of stone material needs to be purchased and has been entrusted to the Longhai Railway Bureau for unified transportation. It can be completed within two months at the latest. More than 4,000 piles of kaolin are still needed, and merchants are directly purchasing it. The magistrates of the counties along the river in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan are working day and night to transport it, which can be completed within two months. The reason for this trip to Jinan is that since all matters have been arranged and special personnel are responsible, I am here to continue discussing the mortgage of public bonds so that construction funds can be obtained early and progress can be facilitated.

<h3>Guangdong Province Transportation Construction: Survey of Funds for Construction of the Southern Section of the Yuehan Railway; Southwest Civil Aviation Company Adds Guangzhou-Babu Line</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Guangdong Province has been actively engaged in transportation construction recently, with particular attention to highway administration and aviation. Currently, the Yuehan Railway Southern Section Bureau is both handling responsible transport and accelerating the construction of railway tracks in the Xiang-Yue border region. Due to the vastness of the project and the presence of overlapping mountains above Lechang Pingshi, construction is particularly difficult, resulting in significant costs. According to statistics from the Railway Bureau, the operation of the Shao-Le section (i.e., from Shaozhou to Lechang) of the Yuehan Railway is mostly funded by the Belgian Boxer Indemnity for purchasing materials, approximately 2.7 million yuan in national currency. The next largest source is funds allocated by the Yuehan Railway Southern Section Bureau on behalf of the Ministry, amounting to over 2.4 million yuan in national currency. Thirdly, over 800,000 yuan in cash and over 300,000 yuan in materials have been allocated from the British Boxer Indemnity. Additionally, the Ministry of Railways has allocated over 280,000 yuan in cash, totaling approximately 6.7 million yuan. The construction materials and labor costs for the Zhu-Le section (i.e., from Lechang to Zhuzhou) are almost entirely funded by the British Boxer Indemnity, including 1.66 million pounds of material funds arriving in London, 1.24 million pounds of labor funds arriving in China, and 1.25 million pounds of undated public bonds. (The original amount of the undated bonds was 1.56 million pounds, but 1.5 million pounds were issued at a 90% discount, resulting in the actual receipt of the above amount). With the exception of a small portion of material funds used for the Shao-Le section, the total is over 4.2 million British pounds, approximately equivalent to 60 million yuan in national currency. In recent years, the low price of the British pound has significantly affected the adequacy of construction and material funds. The Ministry of Railways has had to find other ways to make up the shortfall. Additionally, the Yuehan Railway Southern Section Bureau has provided a subsidy of over 100,000 yuan. The above is the recent situation regarding the construction of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. In terms of aviation, the Southwest Civil Aviation Company is currently planning to open additional air routes to facilitate inter-provincial transportation and communication. Recently, it has been actively establishing the Guang-Gan line, from Guangzhou to Ganxian. Furthermore, it is planning the Liang-Guang Eight Line, from Guangzhou to Babu in Guangxi. The Guangzhou-Wuzhou route has been operating for a long time, but because Wuzhou is located upstream of the Xijiang River, civil aviation aircraft only reach Yonggui and other places. However, Babu in Guangxi Province is connected to the Xiaobeijiang River in Guangdong Province, and land and water transportation in the area is inconvenient. Therefore, the Guang-Ba Civil Aviation Line is being opened to facilitate rapid transportation. Personnel have been dispatched to Babu and Hexian in Guangxi and Xiaobeijiang in Guangdong to survey locations and construct airfields. On the other hand, civil aviation aircraft have been ordered from foreign companies in Hong Kong. If they can be delivered on schedule, Guangzhou and Babu can officially open air service in January of next year. (December 22)</p>
<h3>Land Consolidation in Jiangxi Province —The First Phase Completed—</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The land tax in various counties of this province has been levied according to the fixed quotas of the former Qing Dynasty. There have been numerous malpractices, such as land without tax, tax without land, secret abandonment, and new ownership without old taxation. Since the provincial government ordered the Department of Finance to actively consolidate, such as abolishing excessive levies, collecting arrears, and establishing charitable lands, the accumulated malpractices have gradually been eliminated and the results are remarkable. However, these measures are still passive. The active aspect must start with land consolidation, because without implementing land consolidation and assessing prices per mu, it would be difficult to reduce the burden on ordinary people and increase the province's revenue. Therefore, the provincial government established a Land Consolidation Bureau the year before last, planning to consolidate the land throughout the province, and decided on eleven counties, including Nanxin, as the first phase. The Land Consolidation Bureau has now been renamed the Land Bureau, and it is still proceeding according to the original plan. After this consolidation of land in various counties, Nanchang, Xinjian, Anyi, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Linchuan, Nanfeng, and other counties have all successively completed the process. According to the results of the consolidation in each county, Nanchang has exceeded the original farmland by approximately 100,000 mu, Xinjian by more than 300,000 mu, Anyi by 120,000 mu, and Fengcheng by 600,000 mu. Based on this extrapolation, the 83 counties in the province are expected to exceed a huge number of ten million to thirty million mu. There are two reasons for the increase: one is that in the past, wealthy families possessed land without paying taxes, and the other is that newly owned land has not been taxed. After this consolidation, the malpractices of land without tax and tax without land can be eliminated, and the burden on ordinary people can be directly reduced. Because in the future, a land value tax will be implemented, and all land will be taxed according to its value, and corrupt and powerful officials will have no way to practice their cunning. As for the method of land declaration in this province, it is said that it will be implemented soon. (25th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Inmates Transferred from Prison Bully New Inmates</h3>
<p>Since the county prison began housing opium offenders, it has become increasingly overcrowded due to the narrowness of the prison cells. Even the corridors are crowded with many people, suffering from the elements. Previously, thirty strong inmates were transferred and detained in the detention center of the local court. Unexpectedly, these transferred inmates have been extremely oppressive to the new inmates, and there have been repeated reports of this. Recently, Xia Buying, who was detained for civil reasons, was bullied, threatened, and injured by eleven transferred inmates, including Jiang Tang. The incident was heard by the judge, who personally investigated and sent the eleven inmates, including Jiang, back to the main prison.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Gu Weijun Returns to Native Place to Bury Brother</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, lost his elder brother, Weiqing, to illness on the 12th of last month at his residence at 220 Macdonnell Road, Shanghai. On the 25th of this month, a memorial service and family worship were held. Xu Cixuan, the county magistrate of this county, made a special trip to Shanghai to express his condolences. On the morning of the 26th, Ambassador Gu, along with his nephews Shan Chang, Ying Chang, Hai Chang, and nieces Jun Qi and Jun Liang, escorted the coffin back to their hometown, taking a Shanghai-Taicang bus to Panjiaqiao Station. Magistrate Xu dispatched a platoon of security guards and police officers to protect them. The cemetery is located in Mengjin Township, the third district of the county. After arriving at the station, they transferred to a boat to transport the coffin to the cemetery, arriving at noon. Ambassador Gu inspected the site and returned to his Shanghai residence at 2 p.m. On the 27th, at the hour of Wei (1-3 p.m.), Ambassador Gu went to the cemetery from Shanghai to pay his respects again. According to Ambassador Gu's words to relatives and friends, the embassy building in France was originally rented, but now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved the allocation of funds for construction to enhance the national prestige. He has been back in the country for thirteen months. He originally intended to go to France to take up his new post as ambassador as soon as possible, but he could not do so because his brother's funeral had not yet taken place. Once the funeral is completed, he must leave the country and take up his post in mid-January next year, he said.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Eurasia Airplane Forced to Land</h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation's No. 16 mail plane, which flew from Zhengzhou to Shanghai the day before yesterday, passed through Yiyi around 5 p.m. After the New Year, due to the adverse weather conditions after the snow, it could not proceed and was forced to land in the area of Yin Jingzhang in Shizhuang, east of Tianmo City. The aircraft was slightly damaged. Fortunately, the two pilots, both women, and an interpreter were unharmed. They learned from the bus station that they were running out of fuel, so they urgently dispatched a car to provide gasoline. A Chinese interpreter arrived in the city and telegraphed the Shanghai company, requesting them to send someone to Changshu to repair the plane and transport it to Shanghai. Later, the two pilots went to Tianshenggang at 10 a.m. on the 26th. The Yamato ship happened to be sailing from Shanghai, and the students boarded the ship, instructing it to sail directly to Nanjing. Xu Zhen, the special commissioner of the Nantong district, Jin Zonghua, the county magistrate, Song Mingqi, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Yao Gen, the director of education, received the news and went to the port to dissuade them. The students were very determined, and the situation remained deadlocked until night. All the Jianglun ships going up and down the river were temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>Lecture on National Language Studies What to Read (Continued)</h3>
<p>—Xia Gaizun, Director of the Editorial Department of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about reference books. If any of you ask me what reference books you should read for a certain subject, I honestly cannot answer. I believe that the need for reference books arises from specific topics, and it is temporary and cannot be decided in advance. To put it bluntly, for those who read the first type of books carelessly, there is no need for reference books at all. You must have a topic to consult a reference book. If you don't have a specific topic in mind, flipping through a book randomly is a meaningless and silly thing, like randomly flipping through a dictionary when you don't want to look up a word. Taking the National Language Studies as an example, if you read "Peach Blossom Spring" in the National Language textbook and there are words you don't understand, you have to look them up in the dictionary. At this time, the dictionary (assuming it is the "Ciyuan") becomes a reference book. This article ("Peach Blossom Spring") was written by a Jin Dynasty person. If you feel that the sentiment is somewhat different from the articles written by people from other eras, and you want to know about the situation of Jin Dynasty literature, you will flip through the "History of Chinese Literature" (assuming it is the "History of Chinese Literature" compiled by Xie Wuliang). At this time, the "History of Chinese Literature" becomes your reference book. This article describes a kind of utopian thought. You have learned from teachers and friends that there is a social thinker named Thomas More in England who wrote a book called "Utopia," which is similar in nature to what Tao Qian wrote. If you take it out for comparison, "Utopia" becomes your reference book. This article belongs to the narrative category. If you want to understand the format of narrative essays, you will flip through "How to Write Narrative Essays" (assuming it is compiled by Sun Liangong). At this time, "How to Write Narrative Essays" becomes your reference book. Also, the author of this article is called Tao Qian. If you want to know about his character, you will flip through "Biography of Tao Qian in the Book of Jin" or "The Collected Works of Tao". At this time, "The Book of Jin" or "The Collected Works of Tao" becomes your reference book. These many reference books only arise when there is a topic. Without a topic, there is no way to consult a reference book. Although the school library has many books, and although you actually have many books, they are useless. It is the same with other subjects as it is with National Language Studies. If you are in a history class and listen to the teacher lecturing on the Industrial Revolution in England, if you have a question about this historical event that you want to investigate, you must ask the teacher for many reference books. The library has books on English history, various economic books, and single articles published in recent magazines that are related to this event, all of which become your reference books. Therefore, I believe that reference books cannot be listed in advance. You can only decide temporarily according to the topic you want to consult. Before going to the library to find reference books, first ask yourself, what is the topic I want to consult? If you have a topic but don't know what books to find, you can ask the teacher, ask your friends, and check the book catalog. The worst thing is not even having a topic.</p>
<p>What I said above is about reference books. Next, I will talk about the third type of books, which are books on cultivating interests. These books can be said to be unrelated to schoolwork, and you can choose them entirely according to your own preferences and needs. A person's interests will change. Someone who likes drawing for a while may soon like music. Someone who likes literature may later like religion. As for the cultivation aspect, it is even broader, and the changes are even more numerous. At some point, you may learn that your own shortcomings are in aspect A and should be supplemented and corrected. After a while, you may feel that your shortcomings are in aspect B and should be supplemented and corrected. These natural changes should not be forced or constrained. It is best not to change the goal during a certain period. Reading Tao's poems this week and the history of Western painting next week will make it impossible to cultivate your interests. Reading Zeng Guofan's family letters this week and Cheng Yi's Analects next week will make it difficult to achieve the effect of cultivation. Therefore, I believe that the number of books of this kind does not need to be large in the same period, but the selection should be refined. Select one or two types and set aside time to read them well. Suppose you have decided on a certain type of book on interests and a certain type of book on cultivation for this semester, you may as well just read them. Read them in your spare time outside of regular classes, read them on Sundays, read them after finishing your daily homework, read them on the train or boat when traveling, and read them while sitting on the grass when strolling in the park. If you are not tired of reading them by the end of the semester, continue reading them again next semester until you are tired of them. You may be surprised to hear what I have said. I dare not deceive you. Your purpose in reading this type of book is not to pass the exam, nor is it to graduate sooner or later, but entirely for your own benefit. It is entirely up to you whether you read a book for a year or half a year. The only thing that matters is that it benefits you, and there is no need to worry about the length of time. It is meaningful to read your favorite books permanently. Zhao Pu's reading of the Analects is a famous historical story in China. There was a Japanese writer named Tsubouchi Shoyo, who recently died. He lived for more than eighty years, but he read Shakespeare's plays for more than fifty years.</p>
<p>My words are finished. Now let's have a conclusion. I believe that books are a tool for providing knowledge, and reading is a means of improving and enriching life. What books to read should be decided and selected according to life. First, you should read books about your job, second, reference books, and third, books about cultivating interests. Middle school students should first read the textbooks carefully, because the job of middle school students is to study the middle school curriculum. Reference books can be decided according to the topic you want to consult. The most important thing is to discover the topic. As for books on cultivating interests, you can choose freely. The number of types does not need to be large, the selection should be refined, and you should only change them when you are tired of reading them. (The End)</p>

<h3>Petitioning Students Return to Shanghai from Wuxi. Disembarked at Nanxiang around 6 PM Last Night. The Municipal Government Provided Cars to Transport Them Back to School. Traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Expected to Be Smooth in the Coming Days.</h3>
<p>The student delegation of Fudan University and other schools, totaling more than 1,680 students, who went to Nanjing to petition this month, arrived at Wuxi at dawn the day before yesterday, after which Gu Zhenglun, the Nanjing Garrison Commander, arrived in Wuxi and, together with representatives from the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, conveyed President Chiang's wishes. However, the student delegation insisted on continuing westward by train, so the Railway Bureau had no choice but to dismantle the tracks to stop them. Yesterday (the 27th) at dawn, the student delegation finally complied with the advice and disembarked at Wuxi Station with flags lowered. They were invited by the Military Police Commander Gu Zhenglun and the Wuxi County Magistrate Long Tiyao to enter Wuxi County and paraded around the city once before entering the Zhongnan Grand Theater to concentrate on listening to instructions. The student delegation publicly elected Fudan as the student representative to preside over the ceremony and order of the entire venue. Garrison Commander Gu also read out a telegram from President Chiang, expressing his deep approval of the students' enthusiasm for patriotism, and earnestly advised the students that patriotism must follow the right path to prevent being taken advantage of. Ma Zongrong, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education, also read out a telegram from Minister Wang. Finally, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, spared no effort in persuading the students to return to Shanghai. The student delegation, feeling that the authorities were so sincere in conveying their petitioning purpose to the central government, reluctantly agreed to return to Shanghai that day. Around 3 PM, the student delegation reorganized and boarded the original train. Around 6 PM that day, they arrived in Nanxiang. Upon disembarking, the Shanghai Municipal Government had already hired a large number of cars to welcome them at the station. The male and female student delegations had been suffering from hunger and cold for days, and many had not been able to wash, so they all looked haggard, but their spirits were still very strong. In the area around the North Station, the military and police had all withdrawn around 6 PM and were replaced by armed road police to maintain order. The situation was no longer as tense as it had been in the previous two days. However, the North Station has not yet announced the lifting of martial law because it has been designated as a martial law zone, so passengers cannot pass through. Instead, they change trains at Nanxiang, Macdonnell Road, and the Upper West and Upper South Stations. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Staying Overnight at Gaoqiao. More than 1,000 students from Fudan University, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Fudan Experimental School, Jianguo Middle School, New Asia Middle School, Huanghuagang Middle School, North Municipal Middle School, Law School, and other schools in the city who went to Beijing to petition, left Shanghai on the 24th on two trains. After arriving in Kunshan, except for one train of Tongji students, who were persuaded by the authorities and returned to Shanghai on the 25th, the remaining train continued westward. When passing through Suzhou and Wuxi, many sections of the track were dismantled, so a patrol team of ten students was organized to lead the way on handcars, repairing the tracks at any time. On the 26th, they arrived at Gaoqiao, west of Wuxi, but the rails on the bridge had been dismantled and could not be repaired, so they stayed overnight in the train there.</p>
<p>Leaving Wuxi to Return to Shanghai. Yesterday at 4 AM, the authorities sent personnel to Gaoqiao to find a way to drive back to Wuxi. At that time, Duanmu Kai, a councilor of the Executive Yuan, Sun Guofeng, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, Ma Zongrong, a secretary, Gu Zhenglun, the Commander of the Capital Military Police, from Nanjing, and Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, and Li Dachao, the chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, as well as principals, teachers, and staff from various schools in Shanghai, arrived one after another to persuade the students to get off the train and gather at the Zhongnan Grand Theater near the station. Long Tiyao, the county magistrate, took care of everything. After entering the theater, Duanmu, Sun, and others read out President Chiang's and Minister Wang's telegrams and persuaded them to return to school. After receiving the instructions, the students were quite moved and expressed their willingness to return to school. Therefore, at 3 PM, they boarded the train and left Wuxi to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arriving Back in Nanxiang. After the student train departed from Wuxi Station at 3 PM, the first train was a security team train, and Li Dachao, the chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, was also on board. It drove eastward first, followed by the student train, which was divided into nine sections and drove in succession. At 5:40, the first train arrived in Nanxiang first. Chief Li immediately ordered the security team to be on guard inside and outside Nanxiang Station, fully protecting them. Around 6 PM, the student train also arrived. In addition to Chief Li of the Municipal Government taking care of them at the station, Zhang Xiaotong, sent by the Municipal Party Headquarters, also led the staff to take care of everything at the station.</p>
<p>Transported Back to School Separately. At this time, the municipal government had sent a large number of cars to stop outside the station. The staff sent by the Municipal Party Headquarters went to each section of the train to greet the students one by one. The students were still very energetic in the train, shouting slogans and singing majestic patriotic songs, but there were some who looked tired. The students got off the train in batches, lined up at the station, and after leaving the station, they boarded the cars and were sent back to their respective schools. A small number of students were still on the original train because the cars were not enough to distribute them. They drove straight to Jiangwan. At 9:55, they passed the North Station and arrived in Jiangwan at 10:10. In total, it took four days and nights on the road from the departure on the afternoon of the 23rd to 9 PM last night, which is the end of this stage.</p>
<p>Welcome from Schoolmates. The students of various schools who stayed in Shanghai, after hearing the news that the petitioning students had accepted the advice and returned to Shanghai, went to Nanxiang Station yesterday afternoon to welcome them. Such as the Fudan Alumni Association and the Nankai University students, all went to comfort them. The authorities of Fudan, Jianguo, Southeast, Zhengfeng, and other schools all specially prepared vehicles yesterday evening to welcome them.</p>
<p>Sun and Hao Report to the Ministry. Sun Guofeng and Hao Gengsheng, the representatives of the Ministry of Education, telegraphed to the Ministry of Education last night after escorting the students back to Shanghai, saying: Respectfully to the Vice Minister of Education in Nanjing. At 3 PM today, we escorted all the students back to Shanghai from Wuxi. They arrived safely in Nanxiang at 9 PM. They have now been sent back to their respective schools by car. The result was unexpectedly satisfactory. We plan to take the night train back to Beijing to report in detail. Respectfully, Feng, Su, and Kou are grateful.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Urges Li. Yesterday, Fudan University received a telegram from Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, which read: To Principal Li, recently, we received your respectful telegram delivered by the Executive Yuan on the Respect Day, and we learned about your painstaking efforts to maintain school discipline these days, and we are very grateful. We sincerely hope that you will find a way to continue to persuade the students on the way to return to school and not have any thoughts of retreat. This is what we pray for. Your brother Wang Shijie You.</p>
<p>Passenger Trains Resume. Yesterday, traffic on the two lines has mostly resumed, but Shanghai North Station is still under partial martial law, and passengers cannot enter the station to purchase tickets and board trains. Therefore, passengers traveling up the Nanjing-Shanghai Line must board at Nanxiang Station, and passengers traveling down must disembark at Macdonnell Road Station. Passengers traveling up and down the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line must board and disembark at the Southwest Stations. After 6 PM yesterday, all trains arriving in Shanghai on both lines could directly reach the North Station. From 8 AM this morning, all passenger trains on both lines completely resumed their original state.</p>
<h3>A Letter from Old Man Ninety-Six to the Students of Fudan University.</h3>
<p>After the news that the students of Fudan University were prevented from going to Beijing to petition spread, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of the school, who is now ninety-six years old, was very concerned. Now we have found his letter to the students of the school as follows: Students of Fudan University, in recent days you have been rushing about for the sake of the national crisis, braving the wind and dew, and not even having time to sleep. I am very gratified to hear this. However, Principal Li Denghui has resigned because of this, which makes me feel anxious. However, Principal Li's strong advice to you not to go to Nanjing is indeed to the point, because the officials of the government are all naturally intelligent and must have thought about it carefully and planned thoroughly. (Omission)</p>
<p>Therefore, your trip to Nanjing, even if it becomes a reality, will be meaningless. However, the cornerstone of the country lies in the people. The root cause of today's phenomenon of national subjugation lies first in the ignorance of the people. Look at other civilized countries, are there such situations? The reason for this can be deeply considered. For your sake, instead of appealing to the government, it is better to enlighten the people. Streets and alleys, teahouses and taverns, are all places where you can exert your strength for the country. You must make them clearly aware of their own strength and responsibility, take up their weapons and rise up, and work together to move forward. Then what you do to fulfill your duties is also to supplement the government's education efforts where they are lacking. As an old man, I cannot share your hardships, so I offer my humble opinion. I hope you will strive for the country and cherish yourselves. Ma Xiangbo, December 27, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Mortgage Loan Bank. The Ministry of Finance Orders Establishment. Orders the China Construction Bank to Prepare for Establishment.</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal currency, the Ministry of Finance has been actively planning to increase the number of real estate mortgage loan banks in order to promote the activity of real estate. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has designated experts to draft a plan and ordered the China Construction Bank to plan for its establishment. The letter from the Ministry of Finance is recorded as follows: This Ministry has stated in the case of implementing the legal currency that it will establish a real estate mortgage loan bank to promote the vigor of the market, etc., which has been announced to the public. For more than a month, this Ministry has designated experts to draft a plan and discussed it with various parties, and a rough outline has been formed. However, this bank is very important in terms of domestic and foreign credit. The company has many dealings with foreign financial circles and has always been reputable. It is hereby ordered that the company immediately follow the company's management to plan for the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank. All capital accounting shall be divided independently from the company, and this Ministry will separately promote the raising of share capital to enrich its strength and facilitate its progress. Immediately prepare for its establishment and report the date of establishment. This order.</p>
<h3>This City's Petitioning Students Return to Shanghai Schools; Mayor Wu Reissues a Letter to Students: Passion Runs High: How Can I Contain Myself? I Offer Sincere Words: Urgently and Earnestly Conveying Them</h3>
<p>Following the return of petitioning students from this city last night, Mayor Wu Tiecheng has reissued a sincere letter to the students. The original text is as follows: The petitioning students from this city, excluding those from Tongji and other schools who had already arrived in Shanghai from Kunshan the previous evening, were, after earnest persuasion by the central and Shanghai educational authorities, transported back to Shanghai from Wuxi at 3 PM yesterday. Upon the return of you all, Tiecheng feels as if a loving mother has been reunited with her beloved children; passion runs high, how can I contain myself? Therefore, I offer my sincere words and earnestly, with tears, convey them to all the students of our city.</p>
<p>Since the proposal to petition in Beijing was initiated, you gathered at the North Station, crowding the train cars. In those train cars, did you ever consider the treacherous atmosphere inside and outside the North Station, and throughout the entire city of Shanghai? Your patriotism is, of course, genuine, and your spirit and passion should be sympathized with and admired by us and the people of the entire nation. However, China faces many difficulties, and the situation is complex. The environment in Shanghai is particularly unique. How could we know that those deranged and wicked individuals would seize the opportunity to manipulate public sentiment in order to achieve their sinister plot of using the youth to create chaos? From the second day you arrived at the station, the number of people surged to four or five thousand, and at the same time, reactionary leaflets were frequently discovered. In the Shishan Road area, there were over a thousand people preparing to gather, and some were even willing to create disturbances at all costs, hoping to cause tragedies and brew significant changes. At the time, the situation was perilous and the public was in a state of panic. Tiecheng does not wish to give a detailed account of this. He is only mindful that our bright and promising youth are in this treacherous and unpredictable environment, and if we do not make early and appropriate plans to ensure your safety, the situation will become unimaginable. Therefore, in addition to finding ways to persuade some students to leave the station and return to school, to protect you all and devise a foolproof plan for you, we had no choice but to move the train away from the North Station to avoid unforeseen circumstances. This is the painstaking effort Tiecheng made to protect the youth and maintain the safety of the city, which should be understood by all citizens of our city.</p>
<p>Since you departed from the station and headed west, the Shanghai Municipal Government, in addition to immediately dispatching responsible personnel to rush ahead on different routes to provide careful care, also immediately dispatched personnel to your respective school authorities to go and assist in persuasion and comfort. As for Tiecheng, he was restless from morning till night, from dusk till dawn, and never ceased for a moment to be concerned about your food, clothing, warmth, and living arrangements. He also dispatched the Director of Education and others to persuade on his behalf.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one train of Tongji and other schools returned to Shanghai the previous evening, and the classmates who were stranded in Wuxi also arrived completely last night. This humble sincerity should be understood and accepted by all the students of our city.</p>
<p>You have all returned to school. Although you did not reach Beijing, responsible representatives from the ministries in Beijing have already met with you many times. Although your petitioning train did not reach Beijing, your petitioning will has long been forwarded by the Municipal Government and has been commended and accepted by the central authorities. Your petitioning spirit, as well as your spirit of striving for the country with perseverance and determination, have already been admired and emulated by the people of the entire nation. Return, students! You should restrain yourselves a little, appreciate the sincerity of your teachers' love and care, and quietly contemplate the path of truly serving the country in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the opinion of how the youth of today should serve the country, Tiecheng has already made a sincere and earnest declaration on the 21st of this month, which will not be repeated here. However, if we truly have a deep understanding of the national crisis, we should realize that the true way to serve the country today is not through momentary indignation, but through permanent struggle; not through momentary passion, but through diligence in one's position. If we allow emotions to cloud our reason, mistake the superficial for the real, and mistake means for ends, then we will be eager for quick success but fail to achieve it, and we will move further away from the path of national revival. Throughout the history of national salvation movements, there has been one most tragic phenomenon: the misuse of power and the mutual cancellation of power, which has not only failed to help the national crisis but has also harmed the vitality of society. This is what those who truly love the country are most saddened by. Our country is inherently a nation rich in ability. If our awakened youth can avoid the superficial and unrealistic mistakes of past national salvation movements, recognize the root causes of the national crisis, and understand the overall needs of the nation, then each of us should strive in our respective positions, contribute our abilities, deeply understand the relationship of interdependence, uphold the spirit of being in the same boat, and work together as one, united from top to bottom. We should strive with sincerity, avoid internal strife, and vow to fight for the survival of the nation under the leadership of the central government and within the discipline of the entire nation. Then, even with our deep-rooted weakness, every effort we make will alleviate the national crisis by one point. As a result of the concerted efforts and sincere unity of the entire nation, we will surely create an immeasurably great national power and glorify the long and great life of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The national crisis has not yet ended, and the world is changing rapidly. Return, students! Let us encourage each other.</p>
<p>December 27, 1935, in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Special District Court's Agreement Expires in April of Next Year</h3>
<p>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified all relevant groups.</p>
<p>The Legal Rights Research Association will hold a meeting soon to discuss measures.</p>
<p>Regarding the agreement on the Shanghai Special District Court, which will expire on April 1st of next year, a reporter from the Jiji News Agency, in order to understand whether the agreement will be extended after its expiration, or whether it will be abolished and new measures will be planned, inquired about the details from people in the judicial field and recorded them as follows:</p>
<p>Agreement Process: The Concession Court Agreement was signed in Nanjing in 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China) by representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of five countries, including Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil. France signed as a supplement later. As a result, the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Local Court (i.e., the First and Second Special District Courts) and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the Shanghai Public Concession were established on April 1st of that year (i.e., the date the agreement became effective). This was the process of recovering the Mixed Court and reorganizing to establish the court.</p>
<p>Extension for Three Years: The original term of the agreement was three years, expiring on April 1st, 1933 (the 22nd year of the Republic of China). However, it was noted in the agreement and attached exchange of notes that the term could be extended with the consent of both parties after its expiration. Therefore, upon its expiration that year, after consultation between our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the relevant countries, it was decided to extend it for three years, expiring on April 1st, 1936 (the 25th year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>After Expiration: According to the provisions of the extended agreement, notification should be given to the other party (i.e., the relevant countries) six months before the expiration date, otherwise it should continue to be effective until one party notifies the other party of cancellation and six months have passed. The reporter from the Jiji News Agency learned that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified the relevant countries, but it is not yet clear what measures will be taken.</p>
<p>Active Research: The judicial authorities in our country believe that this matter is of great importance and have now authorized the Legal Rights Research Committee to study the measures, which will then be provided to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for future negotiations. Qin Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, has scheduled to return to Beijing the day after tomorrow to convene the Legal Rights Research Association to discuss everything in order to decide on measures as soon as possible. It is said that the agreement will be largely revised based on the original text.</p>

<h3>Student Patriotic Movement in Various Schools</h3>
<p>Students of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology organized a National Salvation Committee and will start extensive publicity to all sectors today, on the 3rd.</p>
<p>The National Salvation Association of Jiangsu Provincial Wusong Fisheries School issued a notice, saying, "We are in the midst of deep water and fire, lamenting the daily decline of the country.

We vow to dedicate our lives to the country. 2. Eliminate traitors. 3. Please ask the government to make plans early to recover lost territories. 4. Oppose all puppet organizations. 5. We vow to use our blood to unite students across the country and engage in the national salvation movement. The oath has been made, and we will not look back.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Student National Salvation United Association held its second standing committee meeting yesterday. Jingye, Dagong, Minli Girls' High School, Youth, Junyi, Shanghai Girls' High School, Minguang, and others attended. Dagong was the chairman, and Wuben was the recorder. It was resolved that: 1.

Representatives would be sent again to request the Municipal Education Bureau to withdraw its order to advance the New Year holiday. The meeting adjourned after discussion. The original letter of condolence to the petitioning students is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai Major Middle School Students Petitioning Delegation of Fudan University, we express our respects to the students who went to Beijing to petition in the midst of strong winds and heavy snow, promoting popular sentiment. We hereby extend our condolences and wish you good health. Initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Student National Salvation United Association, this month's 24th. The students who gathered at the Shanghai Railway Station to go to Beijing to petition because the train was suspended, a portion of them left the station and departed that afternoon. In order to pass through the concession roads, North Henan Road and other places, all the iron gates there had been ordered closed by the concession police authorities. The students then detoured from Shishan Road into Beisichuan Road through Hanfu Lane. The reserve team defending that place, fearing that it would hinder order, also closed the iron gates there. Thereupon, a conflict arose between the two sides. A western patrolman, Lao Wu, was injured in the hand by a wooden stick, while a student, Wang Zhongguo, was detained. The student was only seventeen years old, a native of Wuxi, and a sophomore at Fudan High School. Yesterday morning, the police filed a public lawsuit with the First Special District Court under Article 136 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhan then proposed an inquiry. First, patrolman Lao testified to the injury to his hand, and then Gu Youzhai, the Chinese patrolman of the Hongkou police station's reserve team, reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant. Questioned, the defendant confessed that because a female classmate fell to the ground at the time, he went to help her and was struck by a wooden stick and kicked. He then retaliated with his feet and did not use a stick to beat anyone. Judge Zhan reviewed the confession and, considering that the defendant was not yet an adult and his actions were excusable, leniently sentenced him to 15 days of detention and suspended the sentence for two years.</p>

<h3>Currency Problem Solved: Shanghai-Sichuan Exchange Rate Stabilized; Only Five Yuan per Thousand from Shanghai to Sichuan; All Exchange Certificates Gradually Recalled</h3>
<p>The six million yuan in local banknotes issued by Sichuan Province over the years, of which half was cash-backed and the remaining half was fully recovered by the Central Bank at 80% of its value, and the cash was returned to the state, caused a great panic regarding currency. Although the financial authorities planned to temporarily circulate a type of exchange certificate (totaling approximately nine million yuan), it was limited to Chongqing and was not a fundamental solution. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, Guan Jiyu, Director of the Financial Supervision Office of the Military Affairs Commission, and Kang Xinru, General Manager of the Sichuan Meifeng Bank (representing Chongqing's financial community), flew to Shanghai together to consult with Finance Minister Kong about solutions. Kong approved an additional loan of eight million yuan from the Sichuan Post-Disaster Public Bonds. After the loan was secured, the three immediately returned to Sichuan. According to sources in Shanghai's Sichuan financial community, the loan has been allocated by the Chongqing branch of the Central Bank, with four million yuan loaned to the Sichuan Provincial Financial Authorities and four million yuan loaned to the Chongqing financial community. All previously circulating exchange certificates have been gradually recalled. As a result, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Chongqing has fallen from over one thousand and thirty yuan to five yuan per thousand, and between Shanghai and Chengdu to seven yuan per thousand. All are settled with legal tender as stipulated by the central government, with slightly higher interest rates. In this situation, Sichuan's finances are becoming increasingly stable.</p>

Former Director-General He left the bureau after completing the handover. Director-General Guo and Deputy Director-General Zhang remained in the bureau to handle all matters. It is said that there were slight changes in the General Affairs Department, but no changes in other departments.</p>
<p>Director-General Guo's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Director-General Guo, the International Trade Bureau was established after a long period of preparation under Minister Kong and with the participation of economic experts, who drafted organizational regulations that were passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. It was reorganized from the Industrial and Commercial Visitation Bureau. Subsequently, Mr. Chen Gongbo, who succeeded as Minister of Industry, attached great importance to the bureau and appointed Mr. He Bingxian as Director-General. In the past three years, various plans have established a good foundation in international trade. He (Guo) was entrusted by Minister Wu to take charge of the bureau. In the future, he intends to focus on practical matters, promote international trade work, conduct thorough research with his colleagues, and report to Minister Wu for guidance.</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet for Former Director-General</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to Investigate Exchange Rates of Subsidiary Currency; Those Not Complying with Ministry of Finance Regulations Should Be Banned</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that banknotes from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, it also stipulated the prices of subsidiary currency: one national currency equals twelve dimes in small coins or three hundred copper coins. The Qianye (money exchange) Guild and its associated Qianye markets comply with the stipulated prices. At the same time, the Central Mint was ordered to mint decimal subsidiary currency. The model has arrived in Shanghai from the United States and trial minting has begun. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in response to a telegram from the Hangzhou Municipal Government, noted that there were significant differences in the number of subsidiary currency exchanged for Shanghai's legal tender. The government instructed the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to investigate and ban non-compliant practices yesterday.</p>
<h3>Guiyang Silk Industry Resolves that National Silk Transported to Guizhou Must Be Certified by the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Guiyang Silk Industry Guild wrote to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: "Respectfully, given the increasingly urgent international situation and the increasingly serious situation in our country, all Chinese people should strive to save themselves. In view of this, and because the current situation is different, it is essential to earnestly resist foreign goods and promote national products in order to recover our economic rights. After repeated meetings by the executive committee and all members, our guild has unanimously decided to implement the promotion of national goods. However, due to the sinister intentions of foreigners who often change the appearance of imported goods to make them difficult to distinguish, we request that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce instruct all domestic factories to affix a certification mark of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce or the General Labor Union to the latest new products of various styles and send them to our guild for identification and differentiation between genuine and fake goods. The above points are recorded. Your esteemed association is based in Shanghai and is concerned with saving the country. We hope that you will support our humble enthusiasm. We respectfully request a reply. With sincere friendship."</p>

<h3>Silk Cocoon Union Submits Request to Zhejiang Provincial Government to Improve Spring Cocoon Collection</h3>
<p>Requests for Cocoon Merchants to Register in Three Phases; Overseas Silk Sales Showing Signs of Improvement; Government Agencies May No Longer Need to Operate Cocoon Collection</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Cocoon Union, located on Rue Mère Lyautey in this city, submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to improve spring cocoon collection next year. The document stated: "Submitted for suggestions for the 25th year:</p>
<p>Unified Management</p>
<p>Provisional measures for cocoon collection, draft proposal submitted for review and adoption. Zhejiang Province's silk industry is the best in Southeast China. Since the disastrous failure of the silk market, many sericulturists have suffered losses, and the silk industry's profits are hanging by a thread. The provincial government, sympathizing with the hardships of silkworm farmers, purchased and distributed improved silkworm eggs, guided improvements in sericulture, and implemented unified management of cocoon collection to prevent merchants from monopolizing and profiting. However, this session's</p>
<p>Too Strict Restrictions</p>
<p>Many cocoon businesses in various places that have the capital to collect cocoons have not been approved. In places where the establishment of cocoon businesses has not been allowed, silkworm farmers are suffering because there is no way to sell their cocoons. Both supply and demand sides are disappointed. Since autumn, silk sales have gradually improved, and the number of sericulturists next year will inevitably increase, and the amount of cocoons produced will also increase significantly. This association, for the convenience of</p>
<p>Silkworm Farmers Selling Cocoons</p>
<p>And for the sake of maintaining the affairs of the industry, after a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, a draft proposal for provisional measures for unified management of cocoon collection in the 25th year was formulated based on the provisional measures for unified management of cocoon collection in the autumn of the 24th year, with some revisions. The main points can be summarized into five items, which are presented as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Sales</p>
<p>Are gradually improving. Silk merchants have sufficient capital to collect cocoons, and government agencies may no longer need to operate cocoon collection to avoid people misunderstanding that the government is seizing business. The cocoon business registration period should be announced as soon as possible so that cocoon collection can be carried out according to registered and approved cocoon businesses to avoid unexpected losses. The registration period for cocoon merchants should be divided into</p>
<p>Phased Registration</p>
<p>The first phase is for local silk factories in the province to exercise their priority rights and be allowed to register without charge. The second phase is for registration by silk factories from other provinces. The third phase is for registration by other cocoon merchants. Local breeds should be allowed to be freely bought and sold by merchants, but they must report for the record in accordance with the regulations, and be subject to the control of fresh cocoon prices, and are not allowed to privately collect improved silkworm eggs.</p>
<p>Consistent with Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>The above points are comprehensively planned based on the situation of cocoon production in the province to ensure the adaptation of supply and demand in the province's silk factories and to promote unification and eliminate conflicts. This not only facilitates silkworm farmers in selling cocoons and maintaining the industry, but also serves the business of the association. Therefore, we submit this request, hoping that the government will review it and adopt it for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Changes Remittance Methods</h3>
<p>Implementation Set for the First of Next Month</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the public and develop business, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has reduced remittance fees and increased remittance amounts. In addition to this city, which has already implemented it, other cities will implement it on New Year's Day next year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Original Remittance Amount: The original remittance fee for postal savings remittances was half a cent per yuan within the province and one cent per yuan outside the province, with a minimum of five cents. The remittance amount ranged from one yuan to two thousand five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Changes: Now, in order to develop business, facilitate the public, and reduce the burden on remitters, the bureau has reduced the remittance fees and increased the remittance amounts. Yesterday morning, Mr. Fang Tinghua, Director of the Remittances Department of the Postal and Remittance Bureau, told a China News Agency reporter that the current changes to the remittance methods involve changing the original remittance fee of half a cent per yuan within the province and one cent per yuan outside the province to a uniform rate, regardless of the province: five cents for remittances under five yuan, ten cents for remittances from five yuan to twenty yuan, two cents for remittances from twenty yuan to two hundred yuan, and one per thousand for remittances from two hundred yuan to ten thousand yuan (i.e., one yuan remittance fee per thousand yuan). The original remittance amount of two thousand five hundred yuan has also been increased to ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Phased Implementation: The above methods have been notified to the postal bureaus and instructed to comply. However, only the postal administration bureau and first-class postal bureaus can issue ten thousand yuan remittance slips. Except for Shanghai, which has already implemented it, other cities are scheduled to implement it starting on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>After Landing, the Eurasia No. 16 Aircraft: Company Sends Workers to Repair</h3>
<p>After On-Site Repair, the Aircraft Continues Its Flight Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 16 aircraft, which flew from Shaanxi to Shanghai on the 25th, was forced to land in the rice fields of Yin Village, Mochen Town, Changshu County, due to weather obstacles that evening. According to further news obtained from the company yesterday, after the aircraft was forced to land, the radio operator Hang Xiaozu remained at the scene to guard the No. 16 aircraft. The pilot, Schlieker, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and reported to General Manager Li Jingcong. After hearing the situation, Li dispatched German mechanic Walter Glavin and Chinese mechanic Shen Yuanzhong and four workers with repair parts from Longhua Airport at 9 AM yesterday, traveling to Changshu by company truck to carry out repairs. Previously, it was planned to transport or dismantle all the aircraft parts and transport them to Shanghai. However, because the fuselage of the aircraft was not damaged and only the internal machinery was slightly damaged, and because the aircraft is a small, extremely fast, and stable aircraft, it was decided to repair it on site. Once repaired, it will continue its flight back to Shanghai. Because the aircraft's structure is better than others, it does not need to use wheels for takeoff, so it will not damage the crops in the rice fields.</p>
<h3>The Warden of the Second Prison Pleads for the Prisoners Suffering from the Cold</h3>
<p>Most of the Prisoners' Clothing and Bedding is Inadequate; Letter Sent to the Buddhist Laymen's Forest Seeking Donations</p>
<p>Due to the cold weather and approaching end of the year, most of the prisoners in the Jiangsu Second Prison on Route Ghisi (Xue Huili Road) are inadequately clothed and bedded, and their suffering from the cold is pitiful. Yesterday, Warden Hu Renqing sent a letter to the Buddhist Laymen's Forest in this city, requesting donations of clothing and bedding. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, the number of prisoners in our prison is nearly three thousand, more than twice the fixed quota. They are poor and lack resources, and eight or nine out of ten are inadequately clothed and bedded. The weather is getting colder, and winter is approaching soon. The prisoners are suffering from the cold and are pitiful. The budget for clothing and bedding for prisoners in our prison is very small, and the national treasury is depleted, making funding extremely difficult. Using a cup of water to save a cartload of firewood will not solve the problem. We have long heard that great men generously help the masses, and all the world admires them. We hope that you will show mercy and extend your kindness to those in prison. Whether it is cotton clothes or quilts, please donate as much as possible so that those who are embracing their knees in prison can rely on your kindness to feel the warmth of spring. In this way, your benevolent acts will spread far and wide, like living Buddhas in ten thousand homes. If you agree, please let us know in advance so that we can send someone to collect them. We will be deeply grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai World Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Hu Renqing, Warden of the Shanghai Jiangsu Second Prison.</p>

<h3>The Little Actress Who Sang at the Tianyun Building Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>She Was Only Fifteen Years Old; Unknown Reasons for Taking Poison</p>
<p>Xu Caifen, a girl from Chuansha, was fifteen years old and sang comic operas at the Tianyun Building of Wing On Company. She was quite famous and lived with her parents at No. 9, Lane 230, Xiamen Road. Unexpectedly, the girl suddenly had thoughts of ending her life for unknown reasons. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Her father, Xu Guiqing, discovered this and rushed her to the Pingmin Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour. However, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 6 AM the next morning. The hospital reported this to the Laozha patrol station in charge. Detective Wu Shoushan was instructed to investigate. He moved the body to the coroner's office on Rue Dunning. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, visited the office to examine the body. Initially, Chinese Sergeant Lu Dagong reported the previous situation. Xu Guiqing, claiming to be forty-three years old and working on a ship, stated that the deceased was his daughter, who sang comic operas at Wing On Company, performing two shows a day, from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM and from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM. The day before yesterday, after the afternoon show, she told me that she would not be coming home for dinner that night. I did not suspect anything else, so I told her to bring more money to buy food. When she returned at about 9 PM that night, she went to bed. I asked her why, and she suddenly said that she had taken opium, but she refused to reveal what had stimulated her. After obtaining the statement, Zhang ruled that the deceased Xu Caifen was a woman who had died from opium poisoning during her lifetime. The body was released to her father, Xu Guiqing, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rural Township Chiefs Wire Request to Postpone Dredging of Hengli River</h3>
<p>The township chiefs of the first and third districts of Shanghai County, in view of the long disrepair of the Hengli River and the siltation of the river, decided to start construction on January 5th next year to implement dredging work relief. However, because the beans and wheat planted by the villagers along the river have already grown, their losses would be great if they were sacrificed at once. The township chiefs requested the provincial authorities to postpone the work until the coming winter to prepare as early as possible in order to alleviate the people's hardship. The original telegram is as follows: Chairman Chen, Director Yu, Director Zhao, and Director Shen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Shanghai County will start construction on January 5th next year after having meetings in preparation of the dredging of Hengli River. Hengli River is a large river and dredging would take a long time. If construction starts now, it will inevitably hinder the spring plowing next year. The beans and wheat planted along the river are flourishing, and it would be a pity to sacrifice them. Moreover, this year's autumn harvest was very poor, and the people's strength cannot bear the burden. Therefore, we request that the government instruct Shanghai County to postpone the work and wait until the beginning of winter next year to prepare for it as early as possible so that there is sufficient time and no interference with farmland. Township Chief Yang Zhuoyun of Beiqiao Town, Third District of Shanghai County, township heads Zhang Shushan, Lin Quangen, He Zhaoxiong, Chuan Pingtu, Liu Wangshan, Township Chief Lin Kongjia of Yuqi Township, township heads Pan Jinshu respectfully.</p>
<h3>Robbers and Pastoral People Discussed Robbery in the Qinghe Hotel</h3>
<p>Detectives Discovered and Went to Arrest Them; Eight Male and Female Robbers Were Caught</p>
<p>—A Pistol Was Found on the Body of a Female Thief—</p>
<p>Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, detectives Wang Xichang and Sun Wenxi of the Chengdu Road Patrol Station, learned that robbers were gathered in Room 232 of the Qinghe Hotel in Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road, secretly discussing plans to go out and rob, and using women to transport guns. Therefore, at about 2 PM on the 24th of this month, they, together with Western Detective Lane, wore steel wire armor, concealed pistols, and secretly went to arrest them. They successively arrested robbers Zhang Apei (alias Li Fusheng, Pan Wenlong, Chen Xiangbao, Lou Asan, Cai Zhilou, Li Wushi (Zhang Apei's mistress), Zhang Wushi (Pan Wenlong's mistress), Jin Asan, and eight others. A pistol and seven bullets were found on the body of Li Wushi and taken to the patrol station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the patrol station, rose to present the circumstances of the case and said that the patrol station still needs to investigate the case, so he requested an extension. Questioned, the defendant Pan Wenlong admitted that he had gone to a restaurant at No. 230 Tianjin Road with Shen Laowu, who is at large, on the 19th of this month, and robbed more than forty yuan on the pretext of eating. Afterwards, he only received sixteen dimes in small coins. The other defendants all provided evasive testimonies. Judge Wu Zehan examined the testimonies and instructed that the defendants should still be returned to custody and the hearing adjourned to January 7th next year.</p>
<h3>Piracy on Haining Road: Detectives Intercept Two Robbers</h3>
<p>On Haining Road, at number 627 to 629, at the Cao Shuntai Rubber Tire Company, at 6:05 PM the night before last, six thugs broke in. Two of them were armed with pistols. They first forced the male and female staff into one room. Then, they proceeded to seize seven diamond and gold rings, worth five hundred dollars, from the wrists of the female staff, planning to escape after looting. At that moment, the shop owner seized the opportunity to slip out and called the 256th precinct police. They apprehended one robber, Wang Afu, a native of Haimen, aged thirty-two, on the spot. The remaining robbers fled towards North Sichuan Road. The police department also, upon receiving the news, dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene, urgently tracking them to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Kunshan Road. However, one of the robbers, acting as the rearguard, preemptively drew his gun and fired a shot, but missed. Subsequently, Chinese officers swarmed forward and captured the robber, seizing a new-style French-made pistol, serial number 22182, along with six bullets. The robber was taken to the Hongkou police station, where he confessed his name as Wang Aliu, from Tongzhou, aged thirty-one, and admitted to the robbery. Seven original stolen gold and diamond rings were found on his person and temporarily stored at the police station. The next morning, the person and the stolen goods were handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Lawsuit After the Closure of the Le Xiang Hotel</h3>
<p>Sponsoring Shareholders Not Responsible for Losses: Li Yougeng's Lawsuit Adjudicated Yesterday</p>
<p>At the beginning of its operation, the Le Xiang Hotel on Jiujiang Road enjoyed a prosperous business with a full house of customers. Later, affected by the economic downturn, it gradually saw a decline in patrons and eventually closed down. The hotel owner, Hu Xiongsheng, when starting the business, created a special category of "sponsoring shares" to facilitate fundraising. It was stipulated that those who purchased sponsoring shares would not be liable for business losses and would receive a monthly dividend of one percent as a preferential treatment. Hu Xiongding, his brother, had a close friendship with Li Yougeng, a Hunanese man working in political circles, and persuaded Li to purchase twelve of these sponsoring shares, each worth five hundred dollars, totaling six thousand dollars. To secure his credibility, Hu Xiongding acted as a witness. Unexpectedly, after the hotel's closure, both Hus went into hiding one after the other. Although Li wanted to recover the share money based on the stock regulations, he was unable to negotiate. Therefore, he hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit against the two Hus in the First Special District Court, requesting the court to order the defendants to repay the share money of five thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, along with the statutory interest. The court, upon receiving the complaint, found that the defendants' addresses were unknown and there was no way to summon them. Therefore, it legally served a public notice, which has now expired. The court then allowed a one-sided debate. Lawyer Zhan presented the stock certificate and share book, which the presiding judge examined and clarified. The judgment was announced the day before yesterday, ordering the two defendants to repay the plaintiff five thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, plus annual interest of five percent until the execution is completed, with the litigation costs to be borne by the defendants.</p>
<h3>Wang Wanchun Convicted and Sentenced for Buying and Selling Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Wang Wanchun, a native of Jiangbei who lives at 33 Huazhenfang, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, and makes a living by renting out rickshaws, recently exchanged twenty yuan in paper money for twenty silver dollars from an elderly Cantonese woman, Li Yeshi, at the Central Bank's legal tender exchange office. Central Bank staff discovered this, arrested him, and handed him over to Chinese detective Sun Jishan, who took him to the General Police Station and then to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him according to Articles 2 and 5 of the Ordinance on Obstructing National Currency. The court had summoned him several times. Because the court received a confidential letter reporting that Wang had previously pulled rickshaws for a foreigner, Wang's actions this time were instigated by someone else, intending to transport the silver dollars out of the country, etc. The court deemed it necessary to investigate this point and ordered Chinese Detective Chief Su Changsheng to investigate. Yesterday morning, when it was time for another hearing, Detective Su submitted his investigation report. When questioned, Wang continued to deny everything. After arguments between the police lawyer Wang and the defendant's lawyer, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, announced the verdict in court: Wang Wanchun was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment for exchanging silver coins with the intention of illegally exporting them, which was unsuccessful. The twenty yuan in paper money was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Merchants of Money and Tobacco Agree on Measures to Suppress Private Hoarding and Selling of Silver Coins</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from illegally exporting silver coins for profit, instructed the money exchange and tobacco exchange industries in this city to quickly formulate measures to suppress the private hoarding and selling of silver coins. After receiving the order, the respective industry associations notified their members to comply and discussed the suppression measures, submitting them to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Real News Agency reporter investigated and recorded the following details:</p>

<h3>Investigation into Li Zifeng's Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Li Zifeng, a native of Ningbo, thirty-five years old, was formerly an accountant at the Guohua Printing Press. Recently unemployed, he had relatives living at number 7, Lane 5, Ximen Road, French Concession. A week ago, the relatives moved to an old house in Lane 5 of the Hongkou district, leaving behind furniture and other items that had not been completely moved. Therefore, they asked Li Zifeng to stay at number 7, Lane 5 to look after the place. On the afternoon of the 25th, at around 3:00 PM, the rickshaw puller of his relatives, Yuan Zilong from Jiangbei, went to visit and found Li lying on his bed, looking weak and exhausted. Suspecting he was ill, Yuan immediately took him to Guangci Hospital by rickshaw. After examination by the doctor, it was discovered that Li had committed suicide by poison. When asked about the reason, Li was unable to speak and the cause of death remained unclear. Eventually, due to the deep poisoning, the treatment was ineffective and he died at 10:00 PM that night. The hospital reported to the police, who sent the body in a vehicle to the Tongren Funeral Hall for examination. His elderly father, Li Yinsheng, sixty-one years old, rushed to Shanghai from his hometown after hearing the news. Yesterday, he reported the matter to the Second Special District Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the hall and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from poison taken before death. The body was handed over to his father for burial with a written guarantee.</p>

<h3>Truth Revealed About the Murder of Chen Hongfu: Roadside Rumors Proven Accurate; Children Tell of Father's Murder; Two Children Suddenly Hidden and Unavailable for Court Summons</h3>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Yanjiacao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, of Chongming origin, was murdered one night last month. After the case was reported, the local court prosecutor detained and arrested the victim’s wife, Chen Wangshi, and the victim’s maternal uncle, Lu Zhiliang, as suspects. It is now known that since the case occurred, people in the area have been talking about it, saying that Lu Zhiliang (also from Chongming) was a foreman coppersmith at the public concession's electric company, earning a good monthly income, and had dozens of acres of farmland in Yanjiacao, Gaoqiao. Previously, in 1931, his nephew Chen Hongfu rented eight acres of land from his maternal uncle Lu Zhiliang to cultivate. Unexpectedly, since renting, it has been four years and the rent had not been paid. Lu repeatedly demanded payment without success. This spring, Lu Zhiliang and his wife, Li, gathered several people and went to Chen Hongfu's house to forcibly remove glutinous rice. Chen refused and reported the matter to the police, who detained Lu and Li and sent them to the court prosecutor's office for questioning and detention, resulting in a decision not to prosecute. Chen Hongfu refused to accept this and filed an appeal to the High Court. Lu Zhiliang resented his nephew Chen Hongfu for resorting to such rogue tactics and hated him deeply. It was discovered that after Chen Hongfu was murdered, according to Chen's thirteen-year-old daughter, "My father was indeed beaten to death by my maternal uncle (referring to Lu Zhiliang) along with three young men whom I didn’t know. My maternal uncle choked my father with his hands, my mother held down his feet, and the three young men beat him with benches, killing him." (According to the court's examination, Chen Hongfu's left and right ribs were broken.) "Then they dragged my father's body out to cover up their crime." The girl recounted everything she witnessed regarding her father's murder to her neighbors Zhang Qinglang and Yang the Blind, etc. Zhang and the others were greatly astonished to hear this, and everyone in the neighborhood was shocked. After learning about these facts, the court ordered Zhang Qinglang, Yang the Blind, and the local headman Gao Linquan to appear in court the day before yesterday for a lengthy investigation. As a result, they were told to leave and await further instructions. However, the one son and one daughter of the deceased, being young and ignorant of the consequences, spoke of their father's murder to everyone they met. Recently, someone hid the two children, so the court repeatedly summoned them without success. There are probably clues to this. After the incident, the local police station summoned the victim’s wife, Chen Wangshi, who claimed that her husband was beaten to death for stealing taro from someone else's field. The police station indeed found half a sack of taro in her house. However, the investigation proved that the taro came from Chen Hongfu's own field and was not stolen. It is evident that Chen Wangshi's statement was flawed. It is believed that once the court conducts a thorough investigation into this shocking murder case, carefully uncovering the truth, the truth will come to light and the injustice will be redressed. It was discovered that the appeal Chen Hongfu filed with the High Court was rejected. The court was delivering the notice at the time Chen Hongfu's body was lying in the field and the judge was conducting the inspection.</p>

<h3>Charity Asks Social Bureau to Order Lumber Industry to Lend More Pine Boards</h3>
<p>Existing Shelters Lack 5,000 Feet of Lumber</p>
<p>The United Association of Charities of this city submitted a petition to the Social Bureau yesterday stating, "Our association previously required 20,000 feet of foreign pine boards to build shelters and bunks for the needy. On the 14th of this month, we sent a letter to your bureau requesting that you forward it to the Lumber Industry Association to discuss the possibility of borrowing the required lumber. It has been found that the number of people sheltered in the one or two shelters as of the 24th totals 2,619. More people are continuing to arrive. After applying the foreign pine boards borrowed from the Lumber Industry Association, there is still a shortage of 5,000 feet. We request that your bureau continue to forward a letter to the Lumber Industry Association, approving the loan of lumber to be transported to the Second Shelter at the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road for use. Upon completion of the sheltering, it will be returned in full. We are sending this letter for your consideration and action." It is also reported that since the Second Shelter at the Chao Hui Villa opened on Monday, the number of poor people requesting shelter has been extremely crowded. The Chao Hui Villa is very large and can accommodate the current 3,000 people in the two shelters. The tension in the work of the registration and feeding staff in both shelters has reached its peak. The poor people require about 20 shi of rice per day. At this time of severe cold, the hunger and cold of the poor is pitiful. We hope that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will actively donate money, goods, clothing, and rice, which can be sent to the association at Renji Shantang on Liu Ma Road. The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, in addition to already donating 1,000 national currency and a large batch of cotton clothing, donated another 156 cotton overcoats, 210 cotton coats, 199 cotton trousers, 331 single coats, 279 single trousers, 183 blankets, 90 oilskins, 200 pairs of old leather shoes, and 100 old cotton blankets yesterday, all sent to relieve the poor.</p>
<h3>Preview of German Documentary Films</h3>
<p>At German School Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>German documentary films have only been shown in Shanghai a few times before. Now, the German community in this city has prepared several documentary films depicting the latest German youth movement, political situation, and industry. The content is entirely about the actual situation in Germany. They are scheduled to be previewed at the German School on Da Xi Road today and tomorrow (i.e., the 28th and 29th of this month). The German community hopes that people from all walks of life in our country will go to watch them to gain a clear understanding of the actual situation in Germany. The German community also intends to lend these films to the authorities in our country who are providing relief for the flood disaster for public screenings in order to raise funds to help the victims of the disaster in our country. The production of the film is very fine. This decision to preview is to avoid crowding and to compensate for the necessary expenses, and it is planned to charge a small fee for tickets. Tickets can be purchased in advance at the German Chamber of Commerce at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road or at the German School on Da Xi Road, or they can be purchased at the door. It is reported that the screening times on the 28th are 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM, and on the 29th they are 11:00 AM and 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Fares Revised by the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company submitted a request to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on October 23 to revise fares. After consideration by the Bureau, there were many unclear points regarding the new prices proposed by the company. The company was then ordered to provide detailed reasons for the revision of fares for each route and section, awaiting consideration. Subsequently, the company stated in a letter that the company was suffering great losses under the current fares. Therefore, the purpose of re-pricing was to increase operating income. The company had recently spent more than 500,000 yuan on the purchase of double-decker buses. In terms of comfort and convenience, the low prices were only found in a few countries in the world. Even with long-distance fares, the fare per mile was only 2 fen and 1 hao and 4 li of a dollar. Recently, the company also felt that the previously set prices were often unbalanced, so it had to be revised to develop the business. Subsequently, after negotiations between the head of the finance department of the Public Works Department and representatives of the company, the original prices were slightly modified. The pricing in some places was indeed lower than the current prices. The revised prices have been approved by the board of directors of the Public Works Department and will take effect on January 1 of the following year.</p>

Furthermore, it is now the middle of winter, and the evaporation of gasoline is also more difficult, and January and February are the coldest months of the year. The inspectorate is using January and February as the standard for inspection to see how the improvement results, and then decide what to do.

<h3>New Discovery in the Pigment Industry:</h3>
<p>Monastral Fast Blue</p>
<p>British dye chemists have recently invented Monastral Fast Blue.

<h3>Prostitution Syndicate Boss Lu Laoqi Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Set for 31st Morning; Lu Bailed Out Yesterday by Yongfengtai</p>
<p>Lu Laoqi, a woman from Nanxiang also known as Wenying, age 35, formerly operated a brothel named Hanzhuang at 114 Chu Chia Chiao (now Avenue Hoche) in the French Concession, and currently resides at 55 Hu Chia Ko in the western suburbs of Shanghai. She was previously wanted for the private establishment of an illegal gambling syndicate and for suspicion of instigating the murder of Shao Wenbin (alias "A'liu" the groom) on the night of July 28, 1933. She was apprehended by French police on the 5th of this month and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. After a thorough investigation by the police, there was deemed to be insufficient evidence to charge her with the murder. She was only publicly indicted by the prosecutor for gambling under Article 268 of the Criminal Code, based on reliable testimony from past offenders involved in the gambling syndicate. Lu also confessed that Xiao Pengtou, a guest, opened a flower gambling listening post in the Chinese area and invited her to invest, but that she did not set up a large syndicate. The police also sent detectives to search her brothel, but she immediately refused to participate. As for the murder, Lu firmly denied it and hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Ma Shouhua to defend her. The court ordered that she be detained and that the hearing be rescheduled. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the Second Special Court, resumed the hearing of the case in the first criminal court. Lu's testimony was the same as the previous two times, but she claimed not to recognize any of the gamblers who had been arrested and punished. Then, Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, and the defendant's defense lawyers cross-examined each other. After that, the court declared the hearing closed and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 31st of this month. The defendant Lu Wenying was to be released on a 6,000 yuan bail, and if no bail was posted, she would be remanded in custody. Subsequently, her family pleaded with Xie Tingxin, the owner of the Yongfengtai South Goods Store in Dongxinqiao Caishi Street, who was a fellow villager, to submit a written guarantee. Out of caution, the court summoned the guarantor Xie Tingxin to court and questioned him at 4:00 PM. Judge Wang opened the hearing, and Xie stated that he had been running the Yongfengtai South Goods Store for 11 years with a capital of 20,000 yuan. Although the market is now sluggish, his store has been open for a long time and can be maintained. He is a neighbor and fellow villager of Lu Wenying, has known her since childhood, and knows her to be honest, so he dared to guarantee that she would not flee. The judge told Xie that he must guarantee that the defendant would be available for all three trials and that he would be responsible for the 6,000 yuan guarantee. If the court ordered him to pay the guarantee, he must pay the 6,000 yuan in full without delay. If the defendant were to flee, he should immediately hand her over to the court, otherwise he would be held accountable for facilitating her escape, etc. Xie hesitated for a long time before fully agreeing and adding text and sealing the guarantee. The judge then ordered Lu Wenying to be taken away by her guarantor Xie Tingxin. Lu Laoqi, who had been in custody for three weeks, was now free.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boats Transporting Fish to Shanghai Robbed En Route</h3>
<p>Fish Cargo Completely Looted, Boatmen Wounded by Bandits</p>
<p>According to travelers arriving in Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday, a fishing boat robbery occurred in Shenjiamen, and fishermen were injured. The fishermen have petitioned the authorities for prompt protection. The detailed situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Reaches Zhoushan. Recently, as the end of the year approaches, the market price of ribbonfish in Shanghai has shown a slight increase. Fishermen from Ningbo sent a large fishing boat to the Siheng Islands to collect fresh fish, obtaining more than sixty dan of ribbonfish, preparing to transport them to Shanghai. On the way back, due to the strong northwest wind, it was already late at night. The boat passed through Daotou in Shenjiamen, Zhoushan, where the fishermen and boatmen fell asleep. Unexpectedly, pirates arrived and took the opportunity to rob.</p>
<p>Robbery at Qingyantou. The fishing boat was towed to the Qingyantou waters by the pirate ship and docked beside the pirate ship. The bandits jumped aboard, wielding weapons, and threatened the fishermen. The four boatmen were guarded by the pirates and unable to resist, forced to comply with their demands. All sixty dan of ribbonfish in the boat were looted, and the pirates also searched for clothes, silver, and other items inside the boat. Any relatively intact clothing was stripped away.</p>
<p>Fisherman Slashed. After the robbery, as the pirates were about to leave, one of the boatmen attempted to seize a weapon from one of the bandits. Another pirate, wielding a sharp axe, suddenly slashed the boatman's face three times. The boatman, covered in blood and in extreme pain, fell to the ground. The pirates then jumped onto their boat, fully plundered, and fled.</p>
<p>Unable to Reach Shanghai. After being robbed, the fishing boat was unable to continue to Shanghai. The fish inside the boat had been completely looted, and the boatman was injured. Therefore, they had to go to Ningbo from Dinghai nearby, sending the severely injured boatman to the hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, someone was sent to Shanghai to report to the local fishing industry authorities, requesting the arrest of the pirates and protection of fishing boats. This incident occurred on the night of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Issue 17: Tidbits About Aviation Lottery Winners</h3>
<p>Da Yun Company Outlet Decisively Sells First and Second Prizes</p>
<p>After the lottery draw for the 17th issue of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery on December 6th at Yiyuan, the Da Yun Company at 170 Damalu (Great Horse Road) in the French Concession of Shanghai not only sold the first prize but also sold quite a few second and third prizes. The first prize, number 278359, was distributed by the company to Huiliyuan in this city for small retail sales. One second prize was sold in portions by the company's own outlet, and another was distributed to Junji Company in Chongqing for sale. The third prizes were distributed to the Hankou branch of the China National Goods Bank and Mr. Qiu Hongchang in the Philippines. It is reported that the first prize winners include Mr. Xu from Gongyi Lane in Zhabei, who won two tickets; Mr. Wei from the Zhongyun Company in the British Concession of Tianjin, who bought three tickets during a trip to Shanghai; Mr. Shen from Lane 114 on Xinzha Road, who won one ticket; and a certain Russian nanny and a driver, who jointly purchased four tickets. The winners have all followed the regulations to collect their prizes from the designated three banks. Among them, the winner Mr. Shen is an unemployed youth whose wife is fierce and intimidating. Since his unemployment, the family's livelihood has depended on his wife. The couple has often felt resentful about their financial situation, and divorce seemed imminent. However, after her husband luckily won the first prize, she suddenly transformed from fierce to docile, like a completely different person, showing extraordinary affection. The fickleness of human nature is indeed like this. The 18th issue lottery will be drawn soon, providing a good opportunity to get through the old lunar year.</p>

<h3>Consecutive Long Shots Skillfully Hit the Basket, Lianghua Overcomes the Pirates With Great Joy, Fifty to Forty-Three, Lianghua Fights With Only Four Players in the End, Situation Extremely Tense, Lianghua Has Five Players Fouled Out, The Two Teams Will Meet Again Tonight at Shen Garden</h3>
<p>The undefeated Pirates were finally defeated by Lianghua yesterday. Lianghua's victory was due to their outstanding fighting spirit on the one hand and the favor of luck on the other. The beautiful long shots were amazing and received endless praise. The tension of the overall situation was unprecedented in basketball games, and the enthusiasm of the crowd was even rarer. The outcome could not be predicted beforehand, and could not be judged during the competition. It was impossible to determine who would win or lose until the end of the game. The warriors of the two teams could not take their temporary advantage as the final victory. However, Lianghua finally defeated its previous opponent, the undefeated Pirates team, by a score of fifty to forty-three.</p>
<p>Three Players Absent</p>
<p>The tension and excitement of the situation can only be deeply remembered by the spectators on the scene, and cannot be fully expressed. It is impossible to convey the process of the game in writing. We can only describe it lightly here and let the readers experience the situation at that time. Lianghua's victory was a great relief for the Shanghai basketball community, and it also avenged the failure of last year. Because Lianghua's Tang Baokun was unable to arrive due to the interruption of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) train, and Liu Zhenyuan also rested due to a hand injury, suddenly losing two main players. In the beginning, many spectators shouted the names of the two and said that it was not worth coming to see the game without Tang Baokun. In addition, the main defender Yin Hongxiang was also absent.</p>
<p>Long Shots Win</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tang and Liu did not play, otherwise Lianghua would still be defeated by the Pirates. Liu and Tang cannot make long shots. In last night's battle, it was impossible to win without long shots. Xu Zhaoxiong was a star for Lianghua. Whenever the Pirates seemed to have a chance to rise, Xu Zhaoxiong would give them a blow to the head with a long shot, thwarting their momentum. Yin Huanwen also tried his best to defend and often made long shots to contribute. Li Zhenzhong has his own special skills, which are impeccable. In short, yesterday's victory was not achieved by the strength of one or two people. The whole team had great achievements. The five official starters were sent off by four after entering, leaving only Li Zhenzhong alone. In the end, they struggled with only four people, almost causing the entire team to collapse and fail at the last minute. Zhang Jing was sent off five minutes after entering the game. The Western referee seemed to be paying special attention to him, which does not seem very clever.</p>
<p>The Pirates Panic</p>
<p>Due to the excessive tension of the situation, both sides often rushed their throws. The Pirates, who were known for their reliable free throws, only made twelve out of the opponent's twenty-seven fouls. Shi Guiya's attitude was not civilized, and his actions were mostly filled with smoke and fire. Shi Guiya contributed to Zhang Jing's early ejection. However, Shi Guiya was not sent off until the end of the game, which was somewhat unjust. Carlson's courage and calmness made him the most outstanding player on the Pirates team. His efforts made the whole team energetic. Long-legged Rhine was the most effective under the basket, whether on offense or defense, but sometimes he was clumsy and not very useful. His skills were not very good, and he could only use his tall body.</p>
<p>Spectacle of the Crowd</p>
<p>The audience was like crazy drunkards. When the game was tense, every spectator had their own expression, which cannot be described in words. After the game, their voices must have been greatly reduced. Around 5 PM, the crowd surrounded the front and back doors of the Western Youth Association. By 7 PM, the stadium was packed with no space to move. Adventurers were still walking on the one-inch-wide footholds on the railing, squeezing into the crowd. If they were a little restless, they would be in danger of falling from the upper floor. The shouts of the crowd were so loud that unless one was deaf, one would become temporarily deaf. Before the start of the game, the temporary staff of the Western Youth Association lost sight of the big picture, squeezing out the spectators outside the door who were trying to break in. The number of people who could not enter was at least twice the number of people inside. The staff of the Western Youth Association, without badges or important business, could only taste the closed door. This move was very smart and worth writing about.</p>
<p>Only One Point Difference</p>
<p>The score in the first half was twenty-one to twenty-one, with the Pirates' Smith taking the lead with the last goal. Zhang Jing was sent off at eight to five. Zhang's foul was partly intentional, and his intention was indeed promoted by Shi Guiya. Li Zhenzhong stole a cold meal, thanks to Zhang Jing's long pass, opening the record. Carlson made it three to two to take the lead. Shen Yu Gong jumped up and turned around, throwing the ball over his shoulder and hitting the target. After Shi Guiya made it five to four to take the lead again, it became Lianghua's world. Carlson and Smith's efforts made it eight to eight, but the Pirates still failed to surpass. After ten to ten, Lianghua took the lead by three or four points, or only won by one point. Later, it was twenty-one to sixteen, becoming the largest difference. With a giant two shots, Smith succeeded in a long shot in the middle of the field, thus surpassing by one point. This was the result of the first half.</p>
<p>Time of Triumph</p>
<p>The situation in the second half was very chaotic and the most tense. The Pirates made waves, showing off their power with twenty-six to twenty-one. Li Zhenzhong struggled desperately, and Yin Huanwen and Wang Shifu frequently used long shots, which were indeed successful. At twenty-nine to twenty-six, Lianghua once again took the advantage. From then on, Lianghua's brilliance was fully revealed, and their arrogance was extreme. The audience's emotions increased accordingly. Xu Zhaoxiong was quick-handed and quick-eyed, shooting as soon as he got the ball. The long distance was always successful, making it forty to thirty-one, which was the most glorious moment, and the audience was the most proud. The Pirates woke up from a dream and used long-legged Rhine to approach step by step. The score gradually narrowed, but Lianghua did not give in, and Wang Youcai and Yin Huanwen still shot accurately, still leading by forty-eight to forty.</p>
<p>Four Players Fight</p>
<p>At this time, Wang Shifu, Yin Huanwen, and Shen Yu Gong were all sent off one after another. Shi Guiya was also exempted from the battle at this time. When it was forty-eight to forty-two, Xu Zhaoxiong suddenly committed his fourth foul. After that, Lianghua could only cope with four people. The Pirates took the opportunity to rob and became even more rampant. The situation was extremely dangerous. The shouting and roaring became more intense. Li Zhenzhong finally scored a goal, and the final whistle sounded as the ball entered the basket. Lianghua's joy at this time and the frenzy of excitement it gave to the crowd would have made George Bernard Shaw beside himself with delight, unable to be humorous anymore.</p>
<p>Fight Again Tonight</p>
<p>At 7 PM tonight, the two teams must meet again at the Shen Garden basketball room. The venue is spacious, and both sides can give full play to their power. The Pirates lost on this field last night, and they will definitely retaliate with all their strength tonight. Lianghua has already won and naturally wants to maintain its victory. Since the two teams have their own private intentions, the competition will definitely be even more intense than yesterday. The referees are Brandt and Qu Hongren, and tickets are five jiao.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Result in Western Youth Basketball Game, Donghua Loses to Nanxing, Fifty-Two to Forty-Seven, Jinan Will Fight Mailing Tonight</h3>
<p>In the two Western Youth basketball games last night, the unexpected happened. Nanxing defeated the strong Donghua with a score of fifty-two to forty-seven. In the first half, Donghua led with twenty-six to thirteen. In the second half, Nanxing surpassed them with thirty-nine to thirty-one. Since then, although Donghua struggled hard, they often lost opportunities due to panic, while Nanxing's momentum was strong, and their shooting was accurate, which clearly showed that they had a chance to win. In the end, they defeated Donghua with a score of fifty-two to forty-seven. Chen Longxian was attracted by the Lianghua and Pirates battle, and the crowd squeezed him outside the door, preventing him from playing, which was an unexpected and major loss for Donghua. In another game, Yuezhong lost to the Jews, eighteen to twenty-three.</p>
<p>Donghua's General Absent</p>
<p>Because there was the Lianghua and Pirates game, the audience had already filled the upper and lower floors of the stadium by about 6 PM. The Donghua and Nanxing game started at 7:30 PM, which was an unexpected pleasure to have such a large crowd supporting them. However, it was because of this large crowd that Chen Xianglong was unable to play for Donghua. After the start of the game, Donghua was still vigorous, leading by seventeen to four. Later, Nanxing tried hard to catch up. With the close surveillance of the defense and the lively and brave men such as forward Zhou Nu'an, they chased to twenty-three, while Donghua ended the first half with twenty-six to twenty-three.</p>
<p>Nanxing Comes From Behind</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Nanxing took the lead, tying the score at twenty-six to twenty-six. After that, Donghua took the advantage again, but time did not allow it, and Nanxing finally showed its head with thirty-two to thirty-one. Then the situation changed drastically, and Donghua was inferior to it. From then on, they could not show their brilliance again. At first, there was only a difference of one or two points, and then it became fifty to forty-two. When it was thirty-eight to thirty-three, Nanxing's Dong Shichu and others were fouled out four times each, but it did not hinder the situation. Donghua only increased the score by taking advantage of free throw opportunities, but to no avail, and had to admit defeat. Nanxing had previously fought hard against the Pirates, losing by only seven points. Now they have defeated Donghua, and their fighting spirit is commendable.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang University Engineering College Shanghai Alumni Express Their Opinion on President Guo's Resignation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Zhejiang University Engineering College Alumni Association issued a telegram stating: "To all national organizations, legal entities, newspapers, schools, and the people of the nation, Zhejiang University has always valued integrity. However, since Guo Renyuan took office as president, there have been repeated disturbances. Mr. Guo has repeatedly resigned and been reinstated. It is said that this time he again used the name of preventing patriotic movements and arresting students, leading to the movement to oust Guo. There should be a public discussion about the rights and wrongs. However, the alumni of the alma mater can maintain order and attend classes peacefully in a difficult environment, taking into account both personal, school, and national interests. Our association is deeply admired. Now that Mr. Guo has submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education, our association has unlimited sympathy for the alma mater. In addition to telegraphed to the Ministry of Education to approve his resignation, we also hope that people from all walks of life will uphold the principle of safeguarding education and provide rational assistance. We are deeply grateful to the public." Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Zhejiang University Engineering College Alumni Association, December 21st.</p>
<h3>Distressed by the Crisis of National Affairs: Huang Bianqun Commits Suicide in Germany</h3>
<p>Studying Engineering Machinery in Germany with Determination and Perseverance - Severely Stimulated by the Situation in North China -</p>
<p>(New Cooperative News Agency, Berlin) Huang Bianqun, a Chinese engineering student from Kaiping, Guangdong, studying in Berlin, Germany, learned of the seriousness of the situation in North China on the evening of November 22nd. He was greatly angered and, in a moment of excessive stimulation, committed suicide in his Berlin residence. After this incident occurred, the Chinese Embassy in Berlin immediately telegraphed back to China, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to inquire in detail. The reply confirmed the incident. He left behind 2,400 marks in tuition fees. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified his family to handle the aftermath. Mr. Huang was sent to the United States to study at public expense by Tsinghua University in 1927. In 1929, he obtained a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree from Purdue University. In 1930, he obtained a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree. He then went to MIT, where he obtained a Master of Electrical Engineering degree in 1931 and a Master of Mechanical Engineering degree in 1932. He interned in factories and then went to Europe for further study. In 1933, he obtained a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Berlin Institute of Technology in Germany. After that, he began working on his doctoral dissertation. Because he was concerned about the development of highway transportation and the lack of domestic oil production in China, he focused on the problem of charcoal-powered cars, which he expected to complete next summer. Mr. Huang was determined and persevering in his studies, so when Tsinghua University telegraphed to invite him to return to China to teach, he declined. This time, he committed suicide, and our country has lost another engineering talent.</p>

<h3>Healthy World Welcomes the Academic Community to Try Reading</h3>
<p>The Healthy World monthly magazine has been very popular with people from all walks of life since its publication. It is now reported that after the second issue was published, sales were even more active than before. The content of the issue is more increased and refreshed, and the Healthy Pictorial has changed to using beige Dowling paper for fine printing. There are more than ten pictures of female health and beauty and healthy body types. The material is also two-fifths more than before, and no effort is spared in instilling health knowledge. It also provides a strong slant to the untruthful points of some parts of the modern pharmaceutical industry. The purpose is pure, interesting, meaningful, and valuable. It is indeed one of the few modern monthly magazines. It is now reported that the society welcomes trials for those in various circles, such as an attached coin of one corner, sent to Shanghai Tongfu Road 214 Lane 14 The society will be sent as a single plain second period is only attached to the post five points is enough, do not need to add another freight fee, fixed reading of twelve copies a year, even postage only counted five corners, and the Life Bookstore and major newspaper stands are also selling clouds,</p>

He gave full play to the four words of the uprising memorial.</p>
<p>Children's Education Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy (1)(3)(7)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>But nothing could compensate for the loss of freedom; hours of confinement made Nanen know how precious freedom was.</p>
<p>In the last quiet time, when the children went to the creek to see Emmie's new boat launched, she leaned against the window, and then she had endless thoughts, hovering in her little mind. This boat has been named Shu, as a tribute to Mrs. Pei, and was originally scheduled to be launched by Nanen, she had long thought about how to break a small bottle of gallon wine on the boat's mast when the boat was launched. Now she has lost that chance, and where is Little Mei doing it? Thinking of this is due to her own mistakes, tears have welled up in her eyes; just then, a fat bee was rolling around in the yellow flower heart of a rose under the window, and she said loudly to him:</p>
<p>"If you have run away, go home immediately and tell your mother that you have regretted it and will never do it again."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear you give him such good advice, I think he has accepted it," Mrs. Shu said with a smile, at which time the bee had vibrated his pollen-stained wings and flew away.</p>
<p>A few tears have sparkled on the window sill, Nanen hurriedly wiped it away, Mrs. Shu has seen it, picked her up, placed her on her lap, and said gently.</p>
<p>"Do you think my mother's method of treating runaways is good?"</p>
<p>"Teacher, yes," Nanen replied, a day of silence was enough to subdue her.</p>
<p>"I hope I won't have to try again."</p>
<p>"I guess I won't; " Nanen said, looking up, the sincerity on her little face pleased Mrs. Shu, and she didn't say another word, because she would rather let that punishment carry out its effect, rather than diminish the effect by saying too much on the tongue.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Qiu Lang)</p>
<p>"It's hard to be a person," "It's hard to be a person," "It's hard to be a difficult person," no matter how you toss and turn, it always says that it's not easy to be a person! Indeed, being a person is complicated, you have to take care of everything, and you have to pay attention everywhere. In today's world where customs are not ancient and people's hearts are declining, it can be said that it is difficult to be difficult!</p>
<p>For example, if you have property, thieves are always coveting you, making you uneasy and unable to rest. If you don't have money, not only will others despise you, but it will also be difficult to maintain your life!</p>
<p>As for being smarter about spending money, others will say he is "scraping skin," and if he spends lavishly, others will blink at him "abuse." If he is too loyal to his friends, he may be deceived by others. If he is always slick, others will say he is "floating and insubstantial." If he treats his subordinates leniently, he will not be feared, and if he treats them tightly, he will be resented. If he is close to his superiors, he will be close to flattery, and if he is alienated, he will be afraid of losing favor. Therefore, it is difficult everywhere, up, down, left, and right. Only by being fair and cautious, and adopting the doctrine of the mean, can he serve as a compass for dealing with the world.</p>
<h3>Gold and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Someone, has two statues of different styles and incompatible on his desk, which makes people laugh. One is a statue of the God of Wealth with angry eyes, a horizontal whip across his tiger, and a body covered in gold. It is obvious at a glance that it is an 18th-century Huishan product. There is also a nude statue carved out of marble, with cloudy hair and high clusters, starry eyes looking askance, bulging breasts and buttocks, and jade body completely presented. This is a Western product that is in line with the times. Putting these two things of different times and different natures together is especially striking and surprising. One day, I honestly and unceremoniously advised him to remove the God of Wealth and let the nude woman stand alone and be more energetic. He smiled and dropped two lines of scripture and said, "Fish, I want it, and bear's paw, I want it too." I didn't understand, so I asked further, "Don't you even want to throw away this worthless clay puppet and let it make a fool of itself here?" At this time, he said to me with a serious face: This clay puppet is indeed worthless. I turned it around from the mud man's burden with two corners, but what does it symbolize? Doesn't it represent the money that everyone likes? People with money love money, and people without money are also thirsting for money. Everyone in the world worships at the feet of the God of Wealth, let alone me, a mortal! So I offer it on my desk, no less than morning and evening worship, hoping that he will bless me early! After listening to his words, I retorted, "Since you worship the God of Wealth, why put a nude statue next to it to blaspheme the gods and Buddhas?" He smiled and said, "This is also the god of love I worship, what is blasphemy! From ancient times, gold and female beauty have been linked together. When a person is poor, he feels that an old woman with a yellow face is also cute. It is not right with gold. Only a stunning beauty can shine with her gold. Don't you see that every rich man is holding a modern wife! Therefore, in addition to worshiping the God of Wealth, I am still praying to the God of Love, hoping that the two of them will come down together!"</p>
<p>After listening to his seemingly solemn and humorous words, I was speechless to refute them; after thinking about it, I felt that there was a great truth in it, so I wrote it out for people to criticize.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Leaf Workshop</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>The neighbors I live with are a husband and wife, and three children, a family of five. They don't have their ancestors' inheritance to sit back and enjoy the good life, nor do they have a fixed income to provide for their daily life; the whole family thrives on the small-scale bamboo leaf workshop to maintain their life, clothing, food, and shelter; everything...</p>
<h3>Two New Toys</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Bamboo leaf workshops are rare in the city. The scope is very narrow. Most of them are in the house where they live, leaving a piece of land to be used as a workshop. It is a manual labor life. The name is so rude, so most people who are familiar with it may have a contemptuous heart, because it is a manual labor life, a labor life.</p>
<p>In the morning, in the cold wind, you can hear the noisy rustling sound; lying on the window sill, you can see, sitting in the high and fluffy bamboo leaf pile, are people who are sorting out bamboo leaves, men, women, old, young;... They are busy sorting out the scattered bamboo leaves, in order to seek a reward of two copper coins per catty. The reward is so meager, so subtle, but, in this moment of morning light, they are toiling to earn a reward, which is more precious than anything else.</p>
<p>Sizing the work is the second step of the procedure, which can be said to be completely the life of women, the reward is much better than the sorters, but that work is not as easy as the previous one, sizing the pieces of bamboo leaves into long and wide bamboo slices, with two pieces across the open, two feet long; the calculation of the reward is also estimated by weight—catty—each catty is one point and six cents, if you are serious every day, you can also get a price of more than four corners!</p>
<p>"The world has changed, everything has changed! Isn't it? Just take the bamboo leaf workshop, for example. In the past, every burden sold for seven yuan, and there was a profit of two or three yuan. The business was still booming. Now it's not a way out. Every burden sells for five yuan. No one wants it in the east, and no one needs it in the west. It's still so deserted; really, the world has really changed," Lao Guan murmured to everyone he met.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Heroic Words Move Painted Lips, Beautiful Women Gather to Discuss; False Affection Startles Jade Wrists, Poor Woman Escapes Captivity</p>
<p>Mrs. Liu was so modern, beckoning to him with a snow-white arm, how could he not be moved? Moreover, her attitude had softened, and she wanted to talk things over, how could he not go? So he walked in with a smile and said, "What's that? I don't need to hide." Then he walked into the room, put his hands on his hips, sat on the edge of the bed, crossed his legs, and stared at everyone. Mrs. Liu, however, folded her jade arms in her bosom and looked back at him. Jia Duocai said, "Now I'm in, what do you all have to say? I'm all ears here. Anyway, I haven't committed any crimes." Mrs. Liu stretched out her white hand, pointed at him, and said, "You lock women in the house, depriving them of their freedom, and you still say you're not guilty?" Jia Duocai said, "She's my wife, if I don't lock her in the house, should I put her on the street?" He was also extremely angry, and saying the words "small wife" was a great taboo. All the ladies were enraged and pointed at him. One said, "This man's words are such an insult to women, we must teach him a lesson!" With just this one sentence, everyone began to clamor. Some leaned forward a little, pointing their arms straight at Jia Duocai's face. He thought to himself, if they slap me, who am I going to settle the score with? So he turned and ran outside, jumping around in the hallway and saying, "You only care about other people's business, but you don't care about yourselves. You talk about women's liberation, but first liberate yourselves. Why do you put rouge on your faces, perm your hair, wear high heels, and act like playthings?" As soon as he said this, something bright and dazzling, carrying auspicious air, rushed towards his head. Looking back, he felt something whip him. At the same time, he heard a clatter, and a teapot full of water flew past his head and shattered on the ground. Jia Duocai thought to himself, even if I said something wrong, why treat me with such harsh methods? Before this question could be answered, another dark object hit him in the chest—a leather shoe. From there, many things rained down on him. At this time, even if Jia Duocai had a hundred mouths, he couldn't say a word. He just stretched his hands into the air and waved them wildly. Bei Hai only wanted to watch the fun and was very calm, just spreading a newspaper in front of him, resting his hands on the table and watching. He peeked at Jia Duocai burrowing forward, burrowing into Little Western Paradise. The ladies stood in the hallway, gesticulating and clamoring. (384)</p>
<p>A Little Chat on Novels</p>
<h3>Old Novels</h3>
<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>It is also an incomprehensible thing that old novels have suddenly become popular in this modern era a month ago. The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin," which have latent influence in society, need not be mentioned! Even those less commonly seen old novels are very popular. There are old novel stalls everywhere, and the people setting up these stalls may not have been selling books before. Since they specialize in old novels, it is naturally because there are many buyers that they specialize in selling them. Furthermore, seeing that the number of these book stalls is increasing, it is evident that the sellers must be able to make a living from it. Therefore, one can imagine how popular old novels are at the moment.</p>
<p>Some people think that old novels are popular because they are cheap. However, this is not entirely the case. At most, it is only one of the reasons. This can be proven by looking at the cheap new novels in bookstores, which do not sell as well as old novels. The biggest reason is probably that old novels are more interesting and readable, and they happen to be cheap and easy to buy, which creates this temporary phenomenon of popularity.</p>
<p>We believe that although the content of old novels no longer conforms to modern trends, it would be extreme to say that reading them is completely useless. At the very least, apart from some descriptions involving superstition, old novels are quite capable of fully developing China's inherent virtues, and their influence on readers is still positive. It is a pity that the old novels sold at the book stalls now have too many errors and inconsistencies in their writing, and the proofreading is too careless! Compared to the old novels published by the World Book Company, there is no problem of careless proofreading. However, it is a pity that they have not published many so far. In addition to the first batch of ten titles, including "Dream of the Red Chamber," the most recent publications only include more than ten titles, such as "Golden Lotus" and "Romance of the States." Besides being meticulously proofread and beautifully bound, they also highlight the special features of each title and include textual research, re-evaluating the value of old novels, which can be considered an important work that adapts to the environment!</p>
<p>Amusements</p>
<h3>The Drama Club of Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The drama, which has been declining in our country for a long time, is unexpectedly budding vigorously among students studying in Japan. This is thanks to several compatriots studying literature and art, holding the determination to revive drama with art. This time, they established the "Chinese Drama Troupe" for the first time in Japan, using the Tsukiji Little Theater for their maiden performance. The results were very good, giving the Japanese and fellow students a good impression. The plays for the second and third performances have also been announced. There is a great momentum for outstanding achievements and efforts, creating new activities for students studying in Japan.</p>
<p>Having not seen the drama of the motherland for a long time, I was of course eager to experience the flavor of the motherland upon hearing the news of the "Chinese Drama Troupe's" performance. Therefore, the performances were held for two consecutive days, two performances each day, and they were all full. In the theater, everything was handled by the students studying in Japan, except that the seating arrangements were made by Japanese women. The audience were of course all compatriots, greeting each other very warmly. Several people brought their Japanese girlfriends to watch Chinese dramas they had never seen before. Several Japanese police officers were sitting in the last few rows, staring blankly. I'm afraid there were no Japanese who came to study Chinese drama seriously.</p>
<p>There were two plays in total. One was "Breaching the Dike" by Wu Tianjun, which resembled a fragment from the famous novel "The Earth." It depicted a village in the Yangtze River basin this year, where Old Man Wang's son was arrested for offending the landlord Master He (the drama begins after the arrest). The eldest son, Jin Gui, also had a falling out with Mr. Wu, who was collecting donations for dike construction. So Mr. Wu instigated Master He to capture Jin Gui again, forcing him to repair the dike. Jin Gui felt it was his duty to repair the dike, so he left his old father and wife. However, it was too late, and the dike collapsed. Mr. Wu took the opportunity to push Jin Gui into the water. After hearing the news, his wife also jumped into the water to follow her husband in death, leaving only Old Man Wang and his young daughter, Xiao Mao. Initially, because they were reluctant to part with their property, they refused to escape. As a result, the water had already flooded the house, and they could not leave. They begged Master He and Mr. Wu for help with their ferry, but they were refused. They had no choice but to hold each other and wait for death. Chen Cejun's Jin Gui, Li Yuexuan's Xiao Mao, Shi Tian's Old Man Wang, and Mary's wife all performed very well. When they were in pain and screaming wildly, they all shed tears like rain. The reporter also grew up in a watery village in the Yangtze River basin, and this kind of thing was almost personally experienced. I remember during the floods, watching my kind father look at the sky with a worried face, my heart ached even more. Therefore, from the opening to the closing, the tears of sympathy never stopped, which shows that their performance was very real.</p>
<p>The second play was "The Inspection Commissioner," which was adapted from the original Russian play by Gogol into a Chinese drama. It depicted a wandering young man who was stuck in a hotel and mistaken by local officials as a secret inspection commissioner. He received a grand welcome and hospitality, and the county magistrate, judge, and school principal all offered bribes and flattery. Later, he moved into the county magistrate's house and had romantic affairs with the county magistrate's wife and daughter. As a result, he had to escape, and the matter was exposed. At that time, the real inspection commissioner finally arrived. This was a satirical comedy that vividly portrayed the corruption of the officialdom. However, because the original play was set in Russia, many places, such as kneeling on the ground to propose marriage, the county magistrate bringing out his wife and daughter to entertain, and moving the commissioner into the house, were not common in China. However, the performance was very lively, but because the structure was loose, it was not as intense as "Breaching the Dike."</p>
<p>Before each act, there was a sound of a gong, I don't know what it meant. If it were replaced with Chinese and Western music, it would be more pleasant to listen to. Or adding a few sections of music to complement the performance, it might be more colorful. The scenery was simple but did not contradict the plot. The use of electric lights to represent thunder, rain, and sunlight was meaningful. The troupe leader spent one or two months of hard work, making this maiden performance very admirable to the audience, which was not easy.</p>
<h3>Using a Kilowatt-Hour Meter to Measure Resistors</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>A kilowatt-hour meter, also known as a Kilo-watt hour meter, is used by power plants to measure the amount of electricity used by customers. Most people who have electric lights installed have one. With a kilowatt-hour meter, we can indirectly measure the resistance of a resistor in ohms.</p>
<p>When measuring, first turn off all the lights and all electrical appliances. Connect the two ends of the resistor to be measured to the wires, and record the amount of electricity used in a certain period of time. Then use the following formula (using the second formula) to calculate the resistance of the resistor in ohms.</p>
<p>In the formula, V is the voltage in volts, A is the current in amperes, T is the time in hours, and W is the electricity used in kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>Now, for clarity, let's use the results of an experiment as an example, as follows:</p>
<p>A resistor (known to be 2000 ohms) was measured in Shanghai using the above method. The voltage V was 220 volts. In one and a half minutes, the disc of the kilowatt-hour meter rotated three times. The kilowatt-hour meter stated that the disc rotated 4800 times per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, we know that W is 3/4800 kilowatt-hours, and T is 1.5/60 hours. V is 220 volts. Substituting these values into the second formula above, we can calculate R as in the third formula.</p>
<p>The answer R is 1936 ohms, which differs from the 2000 ohms stated on the resistor by only 3.2%.</p>
<p>When measuring with this method, one should pay attention to whether the resistor being measured is heating up. If it is heating up significantly, the current should be turned off immediately, otherwise an accident may occur.</p>
<h3>A Powerful Three-Tube Radio for Home and Travel</h3>
<p>— Xue Lun</p>
<p>Our purpose in assembling a radio ourselves is always to be economical, durable, and efficient. However, it is really not easy to have all three. The problem of electricity is the most difficult to solve, because we young amateur enthusiasts are definitely not staying in one place. If we assemble the radio as an AC-powered one, and we have to take it to a place without a power plant for livelihood reasons in the future, then this radio will be almost useless. If you are currently living in a remote rural area, there is definitely no city electricity, so you must choose vacuum tubes such as the 30 type when assembling the radio. However, once you have something to do and have to live in the city, you still have to change the batteries often, wouldn't that be a great injustice?</p>
<p>I think fellow enthusiasts often encounter this kind of problem. Well, I am also one of the sufferers. As the saying goes, "Learn a lesson from a loss, right?" Last month, my AC radio vacuum tube broke, so I decided to switch to a 9.3v car tube. Fortunately, it is very easy to rewind the secondary coil of the power transformer. It took me a day to assemble a home and travel radio. A few days ago, I took it to play on Ma Ji Mountain. Using a temporary indoor antenna, it actually received the broadcasts from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi, which were played loudly in the speaker. Usually, the A battery uses four small round batteries, and the B battery uses two dozen flat batteries. If I increase the B battery voltage and improve the antenna, I think its performance will definitely be more than this, right? The assembly method is as shown in the attached diagram:</p>
<p>L is made of 26-gauge enamel wire, wound 14 turns on a spiderweb coil form.</p>
<p>L1 is made of 26-gauge enamel wire, wound 65 turns on another spiderweb coil form.</p>

<p>The power supply part of this machine can also be installed in two wooden boxes separately from the radio part. After this installation method, the radio can be a lot smaller and more exquisite. In places with city electricity, AC power is supplied. When you learn to travel, put it in your handbag, and you can carry it with you to listen to the radio. Fellow enthusiasts, it is worth a try.</p>
<h3>A High-Performance Two-Tube Broadcast Radio</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>A good radio relies entirely on perfect design and precise manufacturing. This is a universally recognized iron rule. Looking back at the inferior radios that are flooding the market today, their design is outdated and their installation is extremely sloppy. Not to mention the parts used, which are all of extremely poor quality. Just imagine, is it not ridiculous to seek so-called "excellent performance" on this kind of radio? But in fact, there are puzzling things, that is, many short-sighted people, because of greed for temporary cheapness, (?) spare no effort to disregard national interests and buy those inferior machines that are almost waste. When a hundred kinds of problems arise afterwards, making it unbearable to clean up, then it is useless to call out that they have been fooled, but it is already of no help to the matter. This kind of fool can be fooled is not worthy of pity, but the country has suffered a loss invisibly!</p>
<p>Everyone does not want to be fooled after paying money, right? Then let me introduce to you an easy-to-make two-tube radio, which guarantees that you can get satisfactory results from it.</p>
<p>This machine uses two new types of vacuum tubes. One is 6F7, using its pentode part for radio frequency amplification, and the triode part for regenerative grid-leak detection. The other is 79, used for two-stage resistance-coupled audio frequency amplification. Therefore, both selectivity and volume are quite satisfactory. The tone quality is particularly soft because 79 is used for resistance-coupled low amplification. Compared with using 42 and other powerful amplification tubes, it is naturally much better.</p>
<p>Speaking of the installation of this machine, there is not much difficulty. The key is the adjustment of the two high-frequency coils. In fact, if you pay a little attention when winding the coil, and the coaxial capacitors used are of good quality, there is nothing to worry about. The whole machine is installed on a 22''x5''x8'' aluminum chassis. Except for large parts such as vacuum tubes, coaxial capacitors, and coil wires, the rest are placed under the chassis. The 6F7 vacuum tube and the two coils should be shielded to avoid induction.</p>
<p>The reason why I did not draw the power supply part of this machine is nothing more than to allow everyone to change it freely, or to use existing ones to save money. As for the power transformer I used, it was specially designed for this machine and wound by myself. The primary input line is 220v, the secondary high voltage is 250v 30M.A. Filament heating voltage is 6.3v 1.2A. The rectifier tube used is I-V, which is economical and power-saving; in addition, there is another advantage, that is, the filament voltage only needs to wind one 6.3v one. However, if you already have an existing similar powerful three-tube machine's power transformer, then you can also try to modify it for use. The coil manufacturing method and application parts are listed below to conclude.</p>
<p>LL1—Use 32-gauge enameled wire, on 1/4 plastic tube, L1 wound 100 turns, L wound on L1 outside 20 turns, with one or two layers of insulating wax paper in the middle.</p>

<h3>The Effective Value of AC Voltage</h3>
<p>— Hua Xin</p>
<p>Why can AC current be measured in amperes and AC voltage be measured in volts? The answer to this question can be easily solved as long as we recognize that when the heat effect produced by AC flowing through a resistor in one second is the same as the heat effect produced by one ampere of DC flowing through this resistor in one second, it is one ampere. The heat generated by 5 amperes of DC flowing through a 2-ohm resistor per second is 50 watts. The heat generated by 5 amperes of AC flowing through a 2-ohm resistor per second is also 50 watts. Such an ampere is called the effective value of AC current (Efective Value). The effective value of AC current is equal to the maximum value of the current (Maximum Value) divided by the square root of 2, in other words, it is equal to the maximum value multiplied by (0.607). Let I represent the effective value of AC, and Im represent the maximum value of AC, then</p>
<p>(Note: The square root of 2 is equal to 1.414). Similarly, the effective value of AC voltage is also the product of its maximum value and 0.707. Let E be the effective value of AC voltage, and Em be the maximum value of AC voltage, then</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>In addition to the maximum value and effective value, there is also the so-called average value (Average Value), which is often used when AC is rectified into DC. The average value is the average number of instantaneous values (Instanteucoaus value) in half a cycle of AC, which is equal to the maximum value multiplied by 0.637. Let Ia be the average value of the current, and E be the average value of the voltage, then</p>
<p>The maximum value, effective value, and average value are often used in wireless radio transmitting and receiving lines. The voltage measured by ordinary AC voltmeters is the effective value of the voltage, and the measured current is the effective value of the current. The current measured by the DC ammeter inserted in the vacuum tube plate circuit is the average value of the plate current. The maximum value can sometimes also be measured with a vacuum tube voltmeter (Peak Vacuum-Tube Voltmofer).</p>

<h3>Finance Businessmen Loosen Foreign Exchange Sales, Gold Market Continues to Weaken After the Holiday</h3>
<p>Another Ten Yuan Drop—Falling Back to Sixty Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a softening in the decline of Chinese and foreign banks during the Christmas period, along with continued gains from the Far East Bank. This made people hesitant, and Chinese merchants sold off holdings. The domestic foreign exchange market hardened. In addition, there were rumors of spot goods pressing down on the market, which caused the price to drop to below sixty yuan. In the early morning, overseas calls coming in during the market closure period indicated that both British and American markets had fallen. It was said that the supply-side pressure had lessened, and the reception of goods had also improved, with a small number of orders from outside the industry. However, the percentage of allocation for these orders was not announced. The forward silver price in Montreal rose by six to one and a half points. The exchange rate was slightly longer. London spot gold remained unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates were revealed, with British and American rates remaining flat. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was still posted at 1147.3 yuan, and market sentiment was flat. In the pre-market trading, the price opened at 70 yuan. Chun Yuan, Yong Fu Xing, and Yong were the first to sell, retreating to 68 or 69 yuan. Ying Xiang, Fu Yu took advantage of the low prices to enter the market, pushing it above 70 yuan. Fu Xing Yong continued to sell, further lowering the price to 69 yuan. Heng Chang, Yong Heng Yu, and others entered the market. The morning opening was slightly higher, and after opening, the market was relatively stable and continued to rise. Chinese merchants rushed to sell off holdings, and large investors took advantage of the high prices to aggressively sell, breaking through the 70 yuan mark. Although there was much fluctuation in the middle, the foreign exchange market loosened, and supply exceeded demand in the market, gradually moving downstream. HSBC's posted British and American rates remained flat. After falling to a low, the market stabilized. Banks were slow to absorb goods, and the price fell to 61.5 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced, shrinking by 2.5 points compared to before the market closure. Afterwards, banks actively took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market temporarily recovered. However, selling pressure was heavy, and large investors often exerted pressure, making it difficult to sustain. Finally, the price broke through the 60 yuan mark again. After falling to a low, sellers slightly covered their positions, and the market slightly recovered at noon. In the afternoon session, due to purchases by Chun Yuan, Yong Fu Xing, Yong Da Da, and Yong Li, the price gradually rose from below 60 yuan. After the opening, large short-sellers covered their positions, and buying sentiment increased, causing the price to rise. However, due to the tightening of bank appetite, the rising momentum was blocked, and the price soon fell again. Banks rushed to hoard shillings, and the foreign exchange market remained tight, further falling to below 60 yuan. At one point, it became even weaker, but large investors came in when the price was low, making it easy to push the price back up. The initial decision on Indian silver reported a rise of three annas. At this point, the price hovered around 60 yuan, and subsequent trading gradually became mediocre and lacked special changes.

<h3>Securities The Delivery Volume of the December Public Debt Was 72.41 Million</h3>
<p>The Financial Community Is the Main Recipient of Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, December 27, was the date for the delivery of futures for December at the Chinese Securities Exchange. This final delivery still amounted to as much as 72.41 million, so the market was suspended for one day on the 26th in advance for preparation. The amount of money that each broker settled on their own was 40.015 million, and the amount of money settled on the exchange was 32.395 million yuan. On the receiving side, the financial community still accounted for the majority, while the rest were scattered retail investors. On the delivery side, the 16th, 33rd, and 78th were the most common. However, the 78th received a large number of troop reductions. The market price went through a high of 77.8 yuan for the positive 6, which was the highest price increase. The difference between the high and low prices with the market price of 63 yuan on November 1 was a maximum of 14.8 yuan. The difference between the high and low prices of troop reductions was only 12.65 yuan. The rise and fall of gold, short-term salt tax, etc. was only 9.89 jiao. Since the currency system reform on November 4, the market price has repeatedly risen. Many long companies have been found, and there have been rumors of an 8% interest rate and strict investigation of short selling, which caused a stir for a while. Retail investors also turned long, choosing low prices to buy in, so the increase in 6 was as high as 15 yuan. Although the current situation is full of obstacles, people's hearts are still very firm, and new high prices have emerged one after another. At this time, many long companies have gradually emerged. Although the 78th is still raising the price of troop reductions, it is only a strategy to cover up. Other types are still released gradually. It seems that the miscellaneous northern affairs have come to an end. The Jin Gang sold out and sold out every day, which was extremely enthusiastic. It is said that it was the long company that raised the price before, and the solution was in the hands of one person, so the market price gradually went downstream. The so-called collection of interest and so on have become a bubble. At present, many groups have been released, but there are still few large amounts of instructions. The futures for February will start to be released today, and there will definitely be a lively scene, and the trend may not be easy to increase sharply. Now, the delivery settlement, accounting, and total number of transactions will be listed separately by month (unit: hundred yuan).</p>

<p>Chang Feng Jin Gang Cut More</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market in the morning was lackluster. The overseas yarn and flower situation was not good, with each month slightly falling by 3.4 jiao. However, new sellers in the market were not very enthusiastic. When the auction reached the second or third round, Jin Chang Securities came to buy at the market price again, and the market price rebounded again. As a result, each month rose by 4.6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, while the current month fell by 4 jiao alone. The market situation suddenly became weak after the opening in the afternoon. Selling in the market was slightly stronger. Da Ji He Xing's short positions increased, and Chang Feng Jin Ye Gang's long positions closed. Osaka Sanpin fell sharply by 2.5 yuan, and the market fell from this market.

As a result, the situation became weaker and weaker, and the sales of spot cotton were silent, and the falling trend became even more intense.</p>
<p>Da Ji's Short Positions Increased</p>
<p>The standard flower market opened in the morning, and because US cotton continued to fall, the spot price of 1 jiao and 2 fen was broken again. Indian cotton was closed, and the standard price fell again. Market sentiment softened, but there was a lack of new sellers in the market, and the head plate fell slightly. After the second plate, it rebounded again. As a result, each month rose by 5 points to 1 jiao compared to the closing price on the previous day. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation suddenly turned weak. Because the price of cotton in Osaka Sanpin fell, the standard price broke through the 60 yuan mark, so the popularity was panic, and the market price fell step by step, but the transaction was very small. As a result, each month fell by 5.6 and 7 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Da Ji sold 4,700 dan, Yi Chang 1,300 dan, Run Kang 3,700 dan, Chang He 2,200 dan, Sen Kang 1,100 dan, and Yuan Yi 1,800 dan.

The price of foreign wheat was reported, with Chicago at 4 jiao, and the distant market at 4 points to 2 jiao. Canada and Liverpool were closed and had no prices. The market sentiment was that because the year-end was over, there were very few ins and outs in the industry, and everyone was waiting and watching.

<h3>Receivers Are Not Very Welcome for Future Wheat</h3>
<p>After the future wheat market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the various months were generally quiet. Due to delivery reasons this month, the sellers who were preparing to deliver accounted for more than 20 cars. It was heard that the goods were all qualified, but not very high, so the receivers were not very welcome. The market atmosphere was stagnant, which was the reason for this. As for the various distant months, the rising trend of foreign wheat was not much, and many outside long positions were closing, so it was also flat and soft. Considering that the domestic flour sales were not smooth, and the exchange rate was favorable, the market atmosphere should not be too high. The current wheat opened at 4.9 yuan in Shandong and 4.889 yuan to 4.888 yuan in Guan Dian Ming Guang, for a total of 1,500 packs, which were handled by Fu Xin. The price was similar to the previous market, and it had risen by 1 jiao compared to the beginning of the week.</p>
<h3>The River Rice Is Tight Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various groups were still around 30 (with a total of more than 6,000 stone of goods). Due to continuous rain, market sentiment was quite good. The price of thick early japonica rice continued to rise by more than 1 jiao. Although thin rice packs continued to move around 3,000 packs, the eating plate was very tight, so that most of the market conditions could not be fully opened until 3 pm. According to those who opened, there were only one or two points of beauty. Du Yangjian rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half, and the yin change was stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of the various roads under the river were 32 and 33. Due to the cloudy and rainy weather, the white japonica rice was being purchased by shops, stores, and hoarding households, and the price was tight by more than 1 jiao. The early rice followed closely by nearly 1 jiao, and the price of thin rice was firm. Yangbu Jian's retail was normal, and the price was tightened by several points. Since Yuan Ding's momentum, the guest Jian was stable, and the prices of other goods also showed a tight trend.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Hakka Sen Rice Are Still Acceptable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of Hakka Sen rice was initially flat and finally stable. There was a continuous surge of arrivals from Jiangxi, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, and the number of arrivals from other ports was slightly less. However, after the market opened in the morning, the street continued to be active, and the high-end stations were uniform. Following this, the sources from various roads were endless, and the incoming households were all year-end and did not want to do it again. Since transactions were reduced, the market leveled off. Although transactions were light in the afternoon, the city shape was still able to stand firm due to the continuous embellishment of this street. The total city was opened by this street, with 3,800 packs of Gan rice, 3,040 packs of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, 162 packs of Shashi rice, 472 packs of Yong rice, and 236 packs of Anqing rice, totaling less than 8,000 packs, which was less than half of the previous day, but it was still relatively active compared to weekdays.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Gongxi Green Tea Is Also Moving in Domestic Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market remained stagnant. The daily sales of green tea with a medium body and poor quality have continued to be smooth in shops and shops. The Tianjin and Shandong groups have also started to run the Gongxi item. Yesterday, the market traded more than 600 boxes of Xiumei and Gongxi items. The selling price of Xiumei was 9.5 yuan, and the selling price of Gongxi was 14 yuan. The market was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods The Raincoat Cloth Is a Thin Sale in the Market</h3>
<p>The sales of raincoat cloth have turned dull, and the selling price has not increased. Except for the single-sided open water beauty and the Dong goods double-sided yarn, which have a slight increase of several points, the rest have not increased or decreased. Yesterday, the wholesale price of double-sided open water beauty was 7.75 yuan per yard, 5 yuan for single-sided, and 4.4 yuan for the second number. The silver grid elephant skin lining and thin goods have long been outdated in the Shanghai market, so the price is cheap to 2.78 yuan and there is no way out. The first number of Japanese goods double yarn is 7.5 jiao, the second number is 6.5 jiao, the rushed chicken skin is 4.4 jiao, the Bob Lei is 4.5 yuan, and the West goods is 5.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Transactions Still Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overall sugar market trended towards stability. The association set the price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $22.60, a slight decrease of five cents. Re-export goods were priced at $7.40, but no transactions were made. There were no significant fluctuations in Dong Chi and Dong Bai sugars, and few were offered. Our factory's Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 was priced at $21.50, No. 2 at $0.30, No. 3 at $0.10, No. 4 at $20.09, and No. 5 at $0.07. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned 2,680 bags of Wu Yang Guangdong coarse white sugar at $22.50, and 1,518 bags of No. 2 Guangdong Mian Bai sugar at $21.13, all of which were successfully sold. There were still No. 4 Mian Bai sugars priced at $22.12, but no transactions were made. Among the numbered goods, Guang merchants offered over a hundred boxes of Shimen Pian Qing, priced at $8.09.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Sheet Inventory Low and Scarce</h3>
<p>The black iron sheet business has been very prosperous recently. The market's circulating goods have been almost completely exhausted, causing standards to rise steadily. Currently, 2-foot 8-foot 18-sheet bundles are priced at $9.50 each. 3-foot 6-foot 3-sheet to 10-sheet bundles are offered at $9.25 each, while 3-foot 6-foot 11-sheet to 13-sheet bundles are estimated at $9.75 each.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Current Status of Northeast Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Since the three northeastern provinces were occupied by the puppet Manchukuo, their main exports have been primarily soybeans. According to a recent survey of the puppet Manchukuo's main foreign trade in November of this year, exports accounted for 89 million, with an import surplus of over 22 million yuan. The breakdown is as follows (unit: thousand yuan):</p>
<h3>Special Feature: China's Tea Industry (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yi Bai</p>
<p>Country   Quantity     Percentage</p>
<p>Soviet Union   257,470   33.11%</p>
<p>United Kingdom   193,371   34.85%</p>
<p>United States   54,294   6.97%</p>
<p>India   11,782   1.51%</p>
<p>Turkey   4,673   0.51%</p>
<p>Japan   326   0.04%</p>
<p>South Africa   282   0.02%</p>
<p>Other   256,073   32.90%</p>
<p>Total   778,271   100.00%</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's 33.11% share is undoubtedly the largest market for Chinese tea consumption. In 1915, Chinese tea exports to the Soviet Union (Imperial Russia) reached a massive 1.16 million dan, accounting for over half of China's total tea exports. Later, due to the Russian Revolution and the blockade by various countries, the economy was in a state of panic, and frugality became widespread. The export of Chinese tea to that country also sharply declined, plummeting to 11,000 dan in 1920. By 1925, it gradually recovered to 200,000 dan. After 1929, due to the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Soviet Russia, it decreased again from 370,000 dan to 40,000 dan in 1930. When China and the Soviet Union announced the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1932, Chinese tea exports to the Soviet Union also recovered to 230,000 dan. Although it increased steadily from 1932 to 1934, it never regained the level of 1929. This is due to the Soviet Union's own tea cultivation and the export of Japanese Ceylon tea to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's tea industry is a product of the Five-Year Plan. According to a report by the Soviet government, it has spent four years and 25 million rubles specifically on developing the tea industry. Furthermore, according to a recent announcement by the capital of the Caucasus Republic, Tbilisi, the output of green tea in 1935 is expected to reach 12 million kilograms. The tea area will increase by 16,000 hectares. Over 64,000 farmers are engaged in the tea industry, forming 830 collective farms and 15 state farms. This is one of the reasons for the decline in Chinese tea exports to the Soviet Union. In addition, the intrusion of Japanese, Indian, and Ceylon teas into the Soviet market is also a reason for the decline in Chinese tea imports to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The loss of the Soviet market is a death sentence for the Chinese tea industry. The second hope rests solely on the United Kingdom. Sixty-seven years ago, the United Kingdom was China's only market. In 1868, of the 1.54 million dan of total Chinese tea exports, the United Kingdom accounted for 1.22 million dan. From 1868 to 1888, the United Kingdom's annual consumption of Chinese tea was consistently above 1 million dan. However, after 1889, due to the sharp increase in tea production in India, the United Kingdom, which had been China's only market, was seized by India, resulting in the quantity of tea exported to the United Kingdom falling from 890,000 dan in 1889 to 240,000 dan in 1900. In the 30 years or so from 1901 to the present, the average annual amount has been around 200,000 dan. It truly evokes a feeling of unbearable regret! The recent inability of Chinese tea to operate in the United Kingdom is due to the decline in British exchange rates. Japanese tea is taking advantage of this global currency struggle and implementing a devaluation dumping policy in markets such as the United Kingdom, so Chinese tea is truly under triple pressure. The situation of Chinese tea in the American market is exactly the same as in the United Kingdom. Since 1926, Chinese tea exports to the United States have declined all the way. According to the China Daily News (Lianqiao She Batavia Report) of October 25, 1935, all tea imported by the United States in 1886 was produced in China. By 1906, Chinese tea imports to Japan were also numerous, a decision by India. Later, India and Japan engaged in tea cultivation, which has now become increasingly developed. Not only do Japan and India not need to rely on China for tea, but they are also gradually seizing China's market in the United States. Now, in addition to tea from China, Japan, and Java being imported and sold in the United States, there is also an increasing daily amount of products from Ceylon and Annam. China's overseas tea market has not only been taken away or invaded by emerging tea-producing countries, but there is also the abnormal phenomenon of tea from emerging tea-producing countries being imported into China. According to the China Daily News of October 30 this year: "Javanese tea imports into China were 595,561 kilograms in 1931, 326,524 kilograms in 1932, 15,810 kilograms in 1933, and 97,229 kilograms in 1934. In four years, the total reached 1,033,254 kilograms." Furthermore, according to the China Daily News of August 25, 1935: "From January to July 1935, foreign tea imports into China totaled over 150,000 dan, including 4,902 dan from India, 29,004 dan from Ceylon, 15,519 dan from Hong Kong, 29,937 dan from Japan, 48,747 dan from Java, and 14,097 dan from other countries, totaling 92,518 taels of customs gold, equivalent to 167,294 yuan in national currency. At the same time, it can also be seen that China's trade structure is unsound!"</p>
<p>The tea industry development policies of various emerging tea-producing countries are even more active during this period of global economic panic. For example, the Javanese government is implementing publicity policies to develop the Javanese tea industry. In September of this year, the amount was 7,000 shields. This huge publicity expense is compensated by levying a tax of 9.7 cents per hundred kilos of tea.</p>

<h3>Beriberi</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang</p>
<p>This disease is caused by exclusively eating highly refined white rice. This has been proven by experimenting with feeding chickens and pigeons white rice. The symptoms include headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, insomnia, diarrhea, bloody stools, and various beriberi symptoms.</p>
<p>Rice contains essential vitamins A, B, and C, as well as minerals, fats, and proteins, which are essential for human health. Once refined, these elements are lost with the bran and germ, leaving very little and unable to maintain health. Therefore, people in Shanghai are often weak and sick, more so than rural residents. It is said that this is due to eating top-grade white rice, and this is indeed believable.</p>
<h3>The Key to Female Health and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>How can one achieve health and beauty?</p>
<p>A woman's health and beauty depend on satisfactory answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>Is development sound?</p>
<p>Is the mood depressed?</p>
<p>Is menstruation regular?</p>
<p>Are there any hidden illnesses?</p>
<p>Because of differences in environment and physiology, women are often weaker in constitution and more prone to depression. Hidden illnesses such as leucorrhea and vaginal itching, as well as premenstrual, postmenstrual, excessive or scanty menstruation, can be chronic and lead to loss of health and beauty.</p>
<p>Female gonadotropin functions to soothe the liver and dispel depression, nourish qi and blood, and enable the body and breasts to develop well. It also has the effects of regulating menstruation, warming the uterus, treating diseases, and restoring youth. Therefore, it is a supreme product for women to nourish themselves in winter and achieve health and beauty. For those suffering from hidden illnesses such as leucorrhea, using "Liao Dai Ling" externally in conjunction with treatment is even better.</p>
<h3>No Pain During Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Mr. Shu Xiangshang's smoking addiction was developed to relieve his back pain, seminal emission, and stomach pain. He had tried to quit several times, but always failed due to unbearable pain. Recently, the government's ban has been strict, and he had no choice but to quit. He began searching for a painless way to quit smoking. This autumn, he was introduced by a friend to me to treat his back pain, seminal emission, and stomach pain. I prescribed "Wei Tong Ling" to treat his stomach problems, Ximituo's seminal emission pills to treat his seminal emission, and instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to treat his back pain, weakness, eliminate tobacco toxins, and quit his smoking addiction. After about a month, he achieved complete success. His smoking addiction was broken, and there was no pain during the quitting period. His various symptoms disappeared, and he regained his health. Mr. Shu was extremely satisfied.</p>
<h3>Youthful Seminal Emission—Endless Hidden Worries</h3>
<p>— Dr. Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Semen is the essence of the human body and is more precious than blood. Ample semen is not only related to health and longevity, but also directly affects the happiness of life and the issue of offspring. Therefore, young people suffering from seminal emission are like a leaky vessel of health and must be treated quickly.</p>
<p>Patient Lao Ling Weichuan, 22 years old, had been suffering from seminal emission for three or four years. Treatment was ineffective, and the condition worsened. The frequency of seminal emission also increased. Initially, it was several times a month, but now it is more than twenty times a month. He was weak and frail and in a state of decline. This autumn, he was introduced by his colleague Mr. Wei Chongjun to seek treatment from me. I prescribed Ximituo's seminal emission pills to treat his seminal emission and instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" from Zhengwei Pharmacy to nourish his deficiencies. After taking several boxes, the seminal emission was eradicated, and his body quickly recovered to health.</p>
<h3>Stomach Weakness Patients Saved</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Dong Duoshan</p>
<p>(Omitted above) For the past seven or eight years, the amount others eat in one meal is more than I eat in three meals a day. My stomach was so weak, and my body lost its health. Although I had repeatedly taken stomach-strengthening and spleen-invigorating medications, my stomach remained weak, and my body remained weak. Fortunately, Mr. Fan Xinkui introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for treatment. He prescribed "Wei Tong Ling" to eliminate the root of my illness and instructed me to purchase "Jian Wei Su" from Huamei Pharmacy to strengthen my stomach. I took the medication as prescribed, and in just over a month, my stomach problems, which had been considered stubborn and difficult to treat for many years, were cured. From then on, my appetite became strong, and I was no longer inferior to others. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Skinny and Weak Body Quickly Restored to Health</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Patient Yuan Yonghang, with insufficient endowment, was skinny and weak, lost his health, and suffered from various ailments. He sought medical treatment and took medication, and his conditioning was comprehensive, but the effects were lacking, and it was difficult to achieve health. After marriage, he often felt dizzy, had back pain, trembled, felt cold, had night sweats, heart palpitations, and his nerves were in a state of decline. This spring, he was introduced by his brother-in-law Mr. Yang Lansun to seek treatment from me. I prescribed Stanna's "Sheng Zhi Su", and after taking it, the effect was significant. After taking several boxes, his various symptoms disappeared, and his body became healthy, as it had never been before.</p>
<h3>Another Ironclad Proof of Self-Treatment for Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Ms. Feng Yuhua</p>
<p>(Omitted above) After marriage, my menstruation became irregular, and I suffered from chronic leucorrhea. I kept it hidden and did not tell anyone. The pain was deeply personal. I read this publication and saw that many of my female compatriots had similar situations to mine. I carefully studied the principles of the medicines and understood them over time. I purchased "Liao Dai Ling" from a Chinese and Western pharmacy and used it externally as prescribed. I also purchased female gonadotropin from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company and took it for over a month. The leucorrhea was eradicated, my menstruation became regular, and my body quickly recovered to health, as if I had been reborn.</p>
<h3>Insomnia and Seminal Emission Treated Simultaneously</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Those who are good at nourishing life often preserve their essence to nourish the brain. However, patients with seminal emission cannot preserve their essence. How can they nourish their brain? Therefore, exhaustion of essence and symptoms such as insomnia and forgetfulness will appear one after another.</p>
<p>Patient Lu Zhongxiang had been suffering from seminal emission for many years and suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, emaciation, and mental fatigue. He had taken many tonics, but the effects were limited. He procrastinated until now and was introduced by his colleague Mr. Yu Zhifa to seek treatment from me. I prescribed Ximituo's seminal emission pills to treat his seminal emission and instructed him to purchase Sheng Zhi Su from Zhengwei Pharmacy to nourish his essence, blood, and brain marrow. After taking several boxes, the seminal emission was cured, and symptoms such as insomnia and forgetfulness also disappeared at the same time. He became healthier than ever.</p>
<h3>Case Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Another Case of Premature Ejaculation Treatment</p>
<p>Patient Shen Jiehuai, 31 years old, from Zhejiang, businessman. Several years ago, Mr. Shen became involved in social engagements for commercial purposes and frequented brothels, mistakenly contracting a venereal disease. Although he received treatment, his sexual function had been destroyed, and he suffered from severe premature ejaculation. He had sought medical treatment and taken medication, but to no avail. He was in great pain and extremely frustrated, and his nerves gradually entered a state of decline. He looked like he was in his forties. This spring, the premature ejaculation became worse than before, and he became pessimistic. Fortunately, Mr. Feng Jiachu from a certain Shanghai trading house told him that Mr. Feng's younger brother had previously suffered from premature ejaculation and had been cured by me. The next day, Mr. Shen came to me for treatment. I used the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy to stimulate his nerve center and instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company. After taking about half a dozen, his symptoms disappeared, and his nerves gradually recovered. He became strong and healthy, completely different from before.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment Method for Seminal Emission and Wet Dreams</p>
<p>Patient Chu Shuyun, 25 years old, from Pudong, worker. Mr. Chu was induced by bad friends at an early age to engage in the bad habit of masturbation, which was very damaging. His body became weaker and his mind became more listless. He realized the harm and quit, but he had already contracted seminal emission. Initially, it was several times a month, but then it became more than ten times a month. He had taken many tonics, but they had little effect. He procrastinated until now, and the frequency of seminal emission increased. Sometimes, he would ejaculate without dreams. He felt exhausted when he woke up and his body was exhausted. He began to ask around and came to me for treatment. I told him about health preservation methods and used electrical wave induction therapy. In terms of medication, I prescribed Ximituo's seminal emission pills to treat his seminal emission and instructed him to purchase Sheng Zhi Su from the Chinese-French Pharmacy to nourish his deficiencies. After six or seven months, he felt his muscles full, his mind active, his seminal emission was cured, and his body quickly recovered to health.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Case Studies of Kidney Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Kidney Atrophy Patient Desperate for Offspring</p>
<p>Patient Mao Xiaoxun, from Rugao, 37 years old, academic. Mr. Mao was physically weak and married too early, which often caused him to suffer from back pain, dizziness, and blurred vision. What was most unbearable was that his kidneys were weak and he could not fulfill his marital duties. He had been married for many years, not only was he desperate for offspring, but his wife was also resentful and critical. He sought medical treatment and took medication, but it had no effect. The condition worsened daily, and he became increasingly weak. He was extremely anxious and gradually fell into a state of extreme weakness. It was not until this summer that Mr. Qian, a teacher at a certain school, introduced him to seek treatment from me. In addition to instructing him on health preservation methods, I prescribed a large amount of Stanna's gonadotropin. After taking several boxes, his body gradually became stronger, and his various parts developed well. After taking it for a month, his back was strong, his genital function was normal, and his old ailments disappeared. After two months, he was full of life, strong, and healthy, as he had never been before.</p>
<p>Smoking Addiction Broken Early, Seminal Emission Cured</p>
<p>Patient Ye Junfa, from Wuxing, 46 years old, businessman. Mr. Ye had been smoking for 20 years. At the time, he had many illnesses and could not find relief, so he became addicted to smoking. He had tried to quit several times due to various inconveniences, but stopped due to illness and lack of strength. This year, due to the strict government ban, it was difficult to continue. He reluctantly decided to quit, but suffered from frequent seminal emission, dizziness, and mental depression. He was about to fail when his colleague Mr. Fang Xuefan, who had previously suffered from seminal emission and had been cured by me, introduced him to seek treatment from me. In addition to curing his seminal emission with Ximituo's seminal emission pills, I also instructed him to purchase Stanna's "Sheng Zhi Su" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy to nourish his deficiencies, treat his weakness, eliminate tobacco toxins, and break his smoking addiction. After just over a month, his seminal emission stopped after taking the medication, and his smoking addiction also disappeared imperceptibly. He felt disgusted by cigarettes, and his body quickly recovered to health.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"The Farce in North China"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>It is said that the North China issue has come to an end, because the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has now been declared established, which pleases a certain country. However, although there are many optimists, a portion of "ignorant" young students still hold dissenting views. However, this is also inconsequential. Anyway, the independence of five provinces has been reduced to the autonomy of two provinces, and victory still lies on this side. However, hearing foreign criticism calling this play "The Farce in North China" is a bit much. Moreover, they pointed out that the characters who took the stage this time were the ×× warlord, the × Foreign Ministry personnel who joined forces with the warlord, the characters created by the warlord, and the supporting Chinese autonomists. To call the Chinese autonomists "supporting roles" is even more sarcastic. In fact, from the stage, the Chinese autonomists originally occupied the position of the protagonist in this "farce." To say they are "supporting roles" means that foreigners either do not understand Chinese opera or intentionally insult them. Of course, if this play is a "puppet show" with someone pulling the strings behind the scenes, then we cannot know.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as soon as the play opened, a "jumping crown" came out to announce to the audience that in the future, all matters regarding rehearsals and actors would be based on the opinions of the audience. If the audience likes it, we will do it; if they don't like it, we will stop, and we will never deviate. From this point of view, it is fair and just. However, we feel that before this play was staged, everyone tried their best to prevent it from being performed. In particular, they expressed dissatisfaction with certain famous actors. Even though we tried our best to prevent it, and even though we were dissatisfied, the play was still performed, and it was quite lively. The so-called opinions of the audience are just grandstanding and deceitful words.</p>
<p>However, now that the play has been staged, whether we like it or not, we will watch it. Regardless of whether the characters on stage are grandly high-ranking or clowns making jokes, whether they are rehearsing "Losing the Street Pavilion" or "Taking Chengdu," we will, as an audience, closely monitor them from the front of the stage. If they are loyal ministers on stage, we will applaud and praise them. If they are treacherous ministers, we will scold them or simply pull them off the stage. We must not let them act arbitrarily and turn the stage upside down. But what worries me is that they will hire several strong men as bodyguards behind the stage, which will make things difficult.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many Chinese operas. After the "Manchurian Opera" was finished, this "North China Opera" was performed, which is too lively. I wonder when the gongs and drums will stop?</p>
<h3>Winter Night Musings</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>I. Rain and Snow Falling</p>
<p>Scattered fine snowflakes, mixed with the misty rain of dusk, the streets of November, also scattered with endless melancholy. The passing vehicles were so hurried, the footsteps of pedestrians were also hurried, and the silhouettes of the vehicles quickly disappeared into the dusk of the rain and snow-shrouded gloomy corners, but the people lagged far behind. Quickened the pace, tucked the neck into the high collar, but the road is slippery, be careful not to stumble carelessly, and then can't help but look at the vast future with melancholy, a strange anxiety in the heart, why can't I always move forward? Isn't a warm and comfortable home waiting for me to return nearby? Why does it feel more and more distant, as if wandering on a long journey with no end in sight? There is a feeling of nameless sadness. The rain and snow have already soaked the whole body, maybe they are falling harder. But you have never considered taking shelter, nor have you ever thought of hiding under the eaves of a shop for a while, except for secretly cursing in your heart, you just rush forward, you have forgotten all thoughts, leaving only one simple thought—dear home, let me grow wings under my arms and fly up immediately, suddenly you have such a miraculous fantasy.</p>
<p>As if thrown from one world into another, when you step on the threshold of your home, you can't help but jump in, laugh childishly, take a deep breath of the warm air, exhale the frustration that filled your chest just now, quickly change your clothes, and your whole body feels relaxed to the bone.</p>
<p>If you just stroll to the window, look back, at the desolate street scene under the rain and snow that sent you back, the blurred figures of the pedestrians who continue to come behind you, you use a completely different, distant emotional perspective to appreciate and savor the mood.</p>
<p>After all, there is a lovely home, and beautiful seasons will always be waiting for you. But huddled in the streets and alleys, under the invasion of rain and snow, it is truly the season of dreams for those who have no home to linger in. Just accompany the icy wind, watch the rain and snow falling, and send and welcome the long winter night.</p>
<p>II. Wine</p>
<p>On such ice-bound days, what makes people feel most warm is a relatively quiet house with a stove burning. If you can leisurely stay indoors all day, reading some books you like, and take a stroll when you are tired, the time will pass very easily, and besides, the winter days are very short. If possible, you would never want to step out of the door again.</p>
<p>And when night comes, the cold may be even heavier, drink a little wine to warm up, thinking, just then the drinking companions come to visit. So the prepared wine is brought out bottle by bottle, and simple dishes will not hinder the drinking pleasure at all, just that there should be endless wine to drink. So a few people sit by the stove, slowly sipping, warming themselves by the fire, and chatting. Watching the red tongues of fire in the stove rise fiercely, drinking, drinking passionately the red wine, even without knowing how much they have drunk, gradually their faces also turn red. The emotions you restrained cannot help but suddenly become uninhibited, because wine makes you forget yourself, and it also makes you temporarily forget your sad heart. Everyone laughs loudly, talks, and tells secret love stories, but maybe your emotions become fragile instead, you lower your head and sigh quietly, because other people's words unintentionally ignite your faded memories of love, so everyone will sigh for your sigh, but when you suddenly laugh wildly again, wine makes you so naughty. And the wine is endless, and the words are rich and endless. Everyone is intoxicated, the room is full of playful laughter and beautiful words, the heart is floating, what else is there to worry about? Even if it's so cold that your hands and feet are frozen stiff, who would think of it? It's spring in winter, you shout, abandoning everything outside yourself, don't wake up, you are willing to sink forever into this state of darkness, in the icy and lunar days, only such longing can satisfy yourself.</p>
<h3>First Snow</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>The fierce northwest wind blew away the pale yellow sun again, and the surroundings were so cold as if immersed in the Arctic Circle. The dogs in the village had already sneaked into their houses, and the old hens hid in the woodpile, afraid to come out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, goose-palm-like snowflakes were also floating in the sky, flying in the air like plum petals, flying onto the roofs, trees, and ground, gradually piling up. A flock of homeless crows flew around and cawed in the sparse forest of bare branches.</p>
<p>"Rain and snow for three nine days, no firewood and no rice, the bitter coptis weather has arrived again. The pig feed beans at home have already been eaten up. I really don't know how to get through these three nine harsh winter days"! Sanbao's wife sat in the doorway of the stove, weaving straw sandals, looking at the smoke-like snowflakes flying in the courtyard, sighing with cold air, a heavy depression covering her expressionless face. Beside her on the ground crawled a five or six-year-old child, his body wrapped in thick, tattered cotton, wrapped as if he were a wooden pig; one of his dirty little hands, frozen like red radishes, was stuck in his mouth, constantly digging, tears and snot drawing a big painted face on his face, already separating the boundaries. In that thin outline, only a pair of glossy black eyes were active, but a wooden and large body kept crawling on the ground and rolling: "Mom, I'm hungry, Mom, I want to eat"! He cried like this.</p>
<p>"Sigh, eat, in this kind of year, the days of starving to death are behind us"! She dragged the child up from the ground. At this time, Sanbao stumbled in drunk from the back door, almost bumping into the child:</p>
<p>"Maotou, you, you're crying... again"? He squinted his flowery eyes, hummed his nose, and said incoherently, a very unpleasant smell of alcohol spraying straight onto his wife's face; so she glared at him hatefully without good temper, and scolded loudly:</p>
<p>"You瘟殺的, you're happy, aren't you? Where did you go to get your fill of yellow soup? The pig feed beans at home are all eaten up, I'll see how you get through these three nine cold days. Now, while the weather isn't freezing yet, you don't think of something to do, just loafing around all day long..."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"What to do? You go think of it! You weave a few pairs of straw sandals all day long, have you ever sold them for any money!" He replied, sitting down on the threshold, his hands rubbing each other.</p>
<p>"What a joke, you men can't think of a way, so you want a woman to think for you, you're really not ashamed"!</p>
<p>"In this day and age, what's there to be ashamed or not ashamed of: the fields were washed away by the flood and nothing was harvested, jobs can't be found, anyway, starving to death is right in front of us"! He wrung the corner of his clothes hard, rested his head on the door frame, and opened a pair of lifeless eyes.</p>
<p>The snow in the sky was falling more and more fiercely, and the wind seemed to be stronger than just now. The old locust tree outside the door was blown howling, and the treetops were constantly curling in the air, and the magpie's nest was almost about to be thrown down by it; two magpies were standing on the ridge of Grandpa Huang's house across the street, calling incessantly.</p>
<p>"Sigh! Sooner or later it's all starving to death"! Sanbao suddenly thrust her head forward heavily, drooping it to her chest, and her eyelids were about to close; but her hand was picking up a rice straw core and breaking it, one section, two sections, three sections falling on the ground, lying horizontally and disorderly, just like her current state of mind.

<p>Cheng Fangzhou, Li Liansun, Mao Jiashu</p>
<p>Huamei (1060) From 1 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Thinking of Melancholy"</p>
<p>The season of May has arrived, and pomegranates are in bloom. A young and beautiful woman's heart is filled with longing. She wants to be with two handsome men. Mostly, they are beautiful, romantic, and talented. Her heart is filled with love. She can't guess the man's intentions. He's not foolish, and he's not dull. Why is it that they go together and come together? They never speak a word. Now I want to tell you, where can I find someone to confide in? I have no one to rely on. I want to engage in romance. With whom can I have fun? I can't do this, and I can't do that. My heart is full of worries. If, in the future, you come to this place, prepare good food and wine for me. Beautiful men and I will each offer three cups of wine. We will speak our minds and resolve any jealousy. We will live in peace. The two lovers will divide the days between them. When one is not here, the other will surely return. This will make me happy.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Dunben (800) From 7 PM to 8 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Chamber Complaint"</p>
<p>I hate that my lover is like a duckweed, leaving traces everywhere. I am like a pipa, filled with spring resentment. Looking at the green willow catkins in the spring breeze, how can I end the old hatred that torments me? Could it be that my butterfly dream has turned into an autumn fan's lament? The spring scenery in the singing hall is all in vain. Today, in this empty temple, with tearful eyes and a green lamp, I regret my long-lasting shame. "Smiling Romance" is all a lie. Why pursue it with such devotion? Regret my initial ambitions in the game of love. It's better to be like chickens and ducks, living together until old age. Now that the storm has passed, the truth is revealed. The spring dream of the old capital has awakened Zhuang Zhou. I remember the poem on the banana leaf is still there. Why say that I will never linger among wild grasses and idle flowers again? Those who know, both morning in the city and night, see him still strolling shoulder to shoulder with three modern girls. He has no humanity and defies the principles of heaven. Recently, he's been boating with the beauty of the South China Sea. I am like a hidden orchid in an empty valley, cherishing myself. I am isolated and helpless. Who can I rely on? Now I'm staying in the Red Lotus Temple. It's like a leaf boat in a raging sea. Wild rose, I endure and wait. Otherwise, I will have already heard the rooster crowing and announcing the dawn. Alas, my teardrops are soaking through my green gauze scarf.</p>
<p>Xing Ruiting's Golden Phoenix Hairpin</p>
<p>Huiling (1380) From 9 PM to 10 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Flower Moon Liên Châu"</p>
<p>Spring river, flowers, and moon are the most beautiful. The moon reflects the flower wall, flowers and moon together. Flowers love the bright moon, flowers love the moon. The moon moves the flower shadow, the moon moves the flower. When the flowers bloom, waiting for the moon, the zither stops playing. In the moonlight, flowers and drums are wildly beaten. The ground is covered with fallen flowers, golden "Ten" characters. A crescent moon is as jade. A flowery world where spring is always present. Month after month, the tide is faithful. A bright moon cuts a jade axe. Plum blossoms three times, plucking a bronze pipa. Jiang Lang's dreams are filled with blossoming pens. Zhang Ziyou floats on a moon raft. Face like peach blossoms, eyebrows like the moon. The moon in the water, the flower in the mirror. May the old man under the moon transmit a mandarin duck message. May the flower slave pick up a phoenix hairpin. Worshipping the moon and burning incense, our love is sincere. Burying flowers, pitying 玉恨 knows no bounds. The guest of Xunyang with autumn moon and reed flowers. The recluse's home with lonely moon and plum blossoms. The moon palace is swept away, the phoenix tail ribbons. On the flower steps, the phoenix-headed shoes are placed. Fishing for the moon in the water, all in vain. Looking at the flowers in the mist, one's mood is naturally good. Liang Yue longs for people, sad at the moon pavilion. Wearing flowers and passing the imperial examination, walking on the streets. The goddess Su'e lives in the lunar palace. The jade girl wipes the water lily mirror. Wanting to roll up the pearl curtain to cover the night moon. Wanting to prune the bamboo and water famous flowers. Fallen flowers, crying magpies, spring sorrow water. The slanting moon and the remnant lamp, a night dream of debt. Planting flowers in the moon, guarding against rain jealousy. Leaking the moon among the flowers, relying on clouds to cover it. Drinking wine among the flowers, wandering bees dance. Playing the flute in the moon cave, attracting phoenixes to harmonize. The moon serves as a heavy quilt, the flowers as pillows. The flowers serve as four walls, the moon as a home. Heavenly flowers fall in confusion, bewitching flower shadows. The autumn moon is often round, watching the moon's splendor. Cold moon, remnant wind, lonely spring.</p>

<p>Sparse desolate flowers and willows lying. White clouds, ten thousand miles, the moon at the border pass. Blood-stained flowers of the imprisoned prince. Having the moon but not the flowers is truly less lacking. Having the flowers but not the moon is quiet 　. From now on. Sending away the years with flowery mornings and moonlit evenings.</p>

<p>"Miss Youlan"</p>
<p>Liu Fenggang is an apprentice in Wang Delin's tailoring shop. All day long, he suffers all kinds of pain. Moreover, his false father, Zhang Sheng, often comes to threaten and beat him, causing indescribable sorrow.</p>
<p>One day, when the young shopkeeper was unreasonably beating him there, beating him until his head was broken and bleeding, Miss Youlan happened to come to see him. Seeing this situation, she hurriedly tried her best to comfort him, making her feel pain beyond measure. At this time, Wang Delin's nephew, Wang Huiqing, who is a university professor and also Youlan's boyfriend, passed by and saw Youlan here, feeling very strange. After greeting each other, and Youlan told him the inside story, they all helped Fenggang to go together.</p>
<p>Leftover Sounds</p>
<p>Lijie Singing and Music Society, Zheng Qiubai, sent a letter stating that the society has not hired Yan Hua to serve as leader, and earnestly corrected it as follows: Feng Han’s Little Big Enjoying a Couple’s Picture, watching Mr. Wang go to the countryside on Christmas night at Jincheng.</p>
<p>Several titular singing club presidents, such as Qi Yin’s new president Xu Qi, Dalu Club’s Chen Dehua, Ni’s Club’s Ni Penghong, Guangyi Friends Society’s Wu Zhanda, and Black and White Society’s Tao Dan, are too numerous to mention, because they have never broadcasted.</p>
<p>Someone said that Shao Chen, president of the Qingping Society, is probably getting married again soon, with Miss Xiang as the target.</p>
<p>The Qingping Society has been broadcasting on Hangyun for a long time, but the monthly advertising fee is only 10 yuan in French currency from Da Guangming, which can be said to be miserable.</p>
<p>Dian Yin said that the broadcasting news in the Broadcasting Weekly is copied from various broadcasting newspapers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhao Qi and Xing Zheng were found sitting with two women in the New York Ballroom.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Xuan, "Mr. Yan (Hua) has never talked about cooperating with Jin Peiyu again to restore the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>The radio station with the most people is Liang She. There are only three female members, but male members and male visitors fill the broadcasting hall every day. (Above by a silly monk)</p>
<p>Mr. Gan Nailiang, the founder of Liang She, spent four French currency notes on Christmas Day to purchase a large number of Western-style pastries from Guanshengyuan to reward the guests. There were more than twenty people present that day. In an instant, the food ran out. After a while, he added preserved plums and Jiabao cigarettes to entertain the guests. In a blink of an eye, they were also exhausted. Therefore, all the guests tasted the delicious flavors of sweet, sour, and spicy.</p>
<p>Standard music teacher Zhou Mingyuan said, "My ideal lover doesn't have to be very beautiful, as long as she has a good personality."</p>
<p>Yao Ping of Yingyinliu speaks Cantonese-Suzhou dialect, which is quite amusing.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Suzhen, the director of the Mingmei Troupe, has had a voice disorder these past few days. (Above, Mengying)</p>
<p>The Da Ribao's "Yinge" was published the day before Christmas, edited by Gan Nailiang, advocating that what is false is false, and what is true is true, neither flattering nor scolding. (Above, Sea Breeze)</p>
<p>It is said that someone from the Shanghai Yanyan Society was arrested by the Shanghai Bank, Xinhua Bank, and Youxin Syndicate in the Special First Court for owing money.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhang Suzhen of the Mingmei Troupe sold her thighs because of matters of face.</p>
<p>It is not true that Miss Ma Li's piano was bought for her by someone named Li, but was rented from a piano shop on Sichuan Road. (Above, Hundreds of Provinces)</p>
<p>The Singer Newspaper, published and distributed by the Shanghai Lao Xidou Tangjiawan Singer Newspaper Agency, has had excellent sales since the publication of the fourth issue. The first edition of 8,000 copies has been well-received by all sectors due to its rich content. Within half a month of its release, it was felt that there were no books available on the market, and colleagues from all over the country sent letters asking for additional books. Therefore, a special reprint of 3,000 copies was made today for sale. The price is one dime per copy. Try reading and include 16 points for postage. The previous three issues are available for only 4 jiao yang.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi'er</p>
<p>The Cultural Film Company's "Parents and Children" will be screened at Jincheng starting on New Year's Day. This is a work made entirely by "new people" and deserves our special attention. (It is said that "Triumphal Song" will also be screened on New Year's Day, to be confirmed.)</p>
<p>At a time when the old generals are leaving or dying, the film circle is really in danger of becoming a dead city. If there are no good new people to serve as the main force, how can the old, weak, and disabled soldiers hold on?</p>
<p>The director of "Parents and Children", Mr. Hu Xinling, is very young. It is said that the play "Parents and Children" is also "quite" good. (Whether it is really good, let's tell the truth after watching it. Now, we can only tentatively say "quite.") And Hu Rongrong's performance as the flower girl Hu in the wedding is also "quite" good. Hopefully, these are all facts.</p>
<p>It is said that after the student movement, there will be a film industry petition group. This news is sudden, and we will wait and see what happens.</p>
<p>Some say; if the film industry petition group includes male and female stars, then it is believed that if they go to Nanjing to petition, their treatment will be different from that of the students. This saying is somewhat close to nonsense and should be ignored.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin's "Wedding Night"</h3>
<h3>"Little Overlord" to be Screened</h3>
<p>Another New Work by James Cagney</p>
<p>Since "Each One is Brave", James Cagney has starred in several films in succession, but among these many films, the most satisfying is the recent "Little Overlord" Frisco Kid (this film is scheduled to be screened at the Grand Theater on New Year's Eve). This "Little Overlord" tells the story of the 18th century, in a barbaric area of San Francisco, where there was no law, no culture, and the whole city was full of violent thugs. Murder and arson were commonplace. A sinister little overlord was born at that time. His lips were stained with women's rouge, and his fists were stained with the blood of his enemies. James Cagney, playing such a role in this film, is of course very suitable for his personality. There are many dangerous scenes in the film, and there is no slack from beginning to end. It is indeed very rare.</p>
<h3>Several Hardships During the Production of "Triumphal Song"</h3>
<p>The completion of a film really requires the efforts and spirit of many people, especially "Triumphal Song". It did encounter many difficulties. Now let me talk about some of the hardships during the production, which can also be considered a memorandum.</p>
<p>The start of "Triumphal Song" was in a cold winter years ago. Because the plot is set against a drought, we had to start with the interior scenes first. However, the weather was bitterly cold, and although the lights were strengthened, the actors were still shivering with purple lips while acting in thin clothes. Qin Tong even fell ill.</p>
<p>When the interior scenes were finished, it was already the hot summer. The group filmed exterior scenes in Panjiabu, Zhuji, Zhejiang for 25 days. When they returned, everyone had turned into black charcoal, and because the mosquitoes were as fierce as tigers, seven or eight people were lying in bed for more than a month before getting up.</p>
<p>When filming the lotus pond scene in Suzhou, it was already late autumn. Although the earth still had residual heat, the lotus pond under the shade was as cold as ice. The photographer Wu Weiyun and his assistant Wang Chunquan worked naked in the pond for a day and were attacked by the cold air when they returned.</p>
<p>When filming the opening of the dam, it happened that the actors had to be naked, but at this time it was the harsh winter with the north wind blowing, and the state of suffering was really beyond words.</p>
<p>In summary, the production of "Triumphal Song" really suffered a lot. The above is just a part of it.</p>
