<h3>植物病害檢驗之必要</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>農產收穫之豐歉。除天時人事而外。以病虫害之影響。最爲重大。我國號稱以農立國。而一般對於病虫害之防除。向少注意。因此而蒙受之損失。估計每年恒在四十萬萬元以上。亦水旱災以外之一重要問題也。</p>
<p>本國所患。如蝗蝻桑呀。人多知之。而年來國外植物之輸入。繼續增加。自由暢銷。漫無限制。此種外國植物往往各有其特殊之病虫。一遇環境變易。更易滋生蔓延。爲害之烈。反駕於原產地之上。今我國由外國傳入之植物害虫。已不北一種。其爲害已可知者。有紅鈴虫。棉產介壳虫。小麥黑穗病等。此類害虫。近己流行頗廣。影饗收穫至巨。其他未輸入而有輸入可能性之病菌。亦在在堪虞。設若不加防止。其危害我國農產。勢必更甚。</p>
<p>爲防止國外植物病虫之輸入。各國莫不厲行檢騐政策。造成所謂檢騐壁壘。尤以美日二國最爲嚴密。憑藉科學方法。檢騐輸入植物。一旦發見有傳介病虫之危險者。卽禁止其入口。我國出口植物。昔時事前未嘗自行檢查。出口以後。往往有被外國視爲危險。輕則責令退回原產地點。重則全部燒棄。甚且有藉此口實。永遠禁止其輸入者。我國出口物品。向以農產爲大宗。年來對外貿易之不振。此亦其一因也。</p>
<p>夫各國之檢騐壁壘。原爲防北病虫。然其用意兼在限制外貨之輸入。蓋近來經濟恐慌遍及各國。欲謀自拔。不能不採自衛之經濟政策。謀杜絕外貨之侵入。惟是各國相互之間。往往有條約上之束縛。未便一意孤行。故籍檢騐之名。而行禁止輸入之實。其對我國則以我國。出口植物向未經檢查。尤易有所藉口。</p>
<p>我國欲防止外國病虫之輸入。同時爲顧全本國輸出植物之信用。自非樹立檢騐政策不可。蓋對輸出之植物我人先自檢騐。可杜外人限制其輸入之口實。而對輸入之植物。加以嚴密之檢查。足使病虫不致傳入於我國。實一舉而兩得也。今實業部之「植物病虫檢騐條例。」已先從上海舉辦。上海商品檢騐局已於本月二十日開始實行。此事直接足以消滅我國固有之病虫。防止外來病虫之輸入。間接可以爲國內農產輸出之助力。以恢復對外貿易之地位。其用意甚善。亦國人所當予以贊助者也。</p>

<h3>西北視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>從乾縣至長安</p>
<p>乾縣地處高原、鮮有水利可言、耕種田地、惟賴雨雪、掘井及泉、城北較高、須深六十丈左右、城中須四十丈、東部地勢漸低、汲井可資灌漑、然亦深三四十丈、建廳曾派員携器、來打自流井、連打三四處、皆無水而止、全縣人口、初有二十餘萬、民國十八年大旱、逃荒及死亡殆去其大半、最近縣府編制保甲、調查人口、災後經過五年之繁殖、總計只有十五萬餘人、去夏大雨、歲時和稔、農作一年之豐收、可供三年之食用、今春又雪、亦兆大有、城鄉一致歡忭、殊呈向榮之象、惟邑人素有三十年一大旱、十年一小旱之諺、未雨綢繆、防災工作實爲當務之急、建廳掘井未成、似不可中餒也、</p>

<h3>銀錢業向三行拆放　聲請者昨漸减　錢業對展期放欵須另行訂約　劃頭昨驟升至四角銀根轉緊</h3>
<p>新聲社云、中央·中國·交通·三銀行續辦同業拆放後、市面已趨平穩、錢業對工商業放欵要求展期者、已予通融、惟銀根較前轉緊、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>三行拆放　約八百萬</p>
<p>中央·中國·交通·三銀行爲救濟市面計、於民國二十三年總結帳前一、聯合舉辦同業拆放、由中央銀行主持、日前鑒於四底將屆、特續辦拆放、銀錢兩業聲請者、甚爲踴躍、及至昨日截止、連舊借展期之欵、總共達七百九十萬元、昨日起、銀錢兩業聲請者、漸見减少、因經三行拆放處、市面已趨平穩、是項拆放、間接爲救濟工商業、</p>
<p>展期之欵　須再訂約</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向錢業探悉、該業對工商業四月底到期之長期信用放欵展期案、各錢莊决視自身力量、儘量通融、至於各錢莊對工商業長期信用放欵展期、須酌增利息之說、昨據錢業表示、錢業對各項長期信用放欵、均視市面之供求而定利息、况並不一律、過四底後、江浙春繭上市、需求較鉅、其利息自當再行商定、續訂契約云、</p>
<p>劃頭驟升　銀恨漸緊</p>
<p>錢業市塲、昨日上下午兩市洋拆、均爲一角、而劃頭加水、昨日初爲三角、後升至四角、則足證錢莊解銀行之欵驟增、至於洋拆雖與連日相同、但實際上銀根較前轉緊、原因爲供求不能相應、但據錢業界表示、此爲每年四月底必有之現象云、</p>
<h3>華明銀號停業　資本六萬元存欵廿餘萬　與永興同泰有連帶關係</h3>
<p>國聞社云、本埠九江路二二〇號華明銀號、因遭市面衰落、銀根緊縮關係、忽於前日、委請律師俞計師公告暫停營業、茲誌情形如下、</p>
<p>停業一斑　華明銀號、創設於民國二十年冬季、爲合股性質、營業範圍、類乎小錢莊、全部資本僅六萬元、經理爲錢福渠·開設已達三年、陸續在外間吸收存欵二十餘萬、轉放於同業或商舖、近因受市面不景氣關係、一時不能收回、以致現金缺乏、週轉呆滯、頓於前晚、决定暫停營業、一方委託會計師王思芳·實行淸賬、據律師稱、須查明賬目後、方能决定能否復業、但經記者探悉、此次該號之停業、興前昨兩日倒閉之永興同泰順記兩匯劃錢莊、有連帶關係、或因此被迫停業、故能否重整旗鼓、尙不得而知、號中職員已解散、祇餘學徒兩名、股東姓名、現由律師代爲保守秘密中、</p>
<p>律師公告　王思芳會計師、洪士豪律師、代表華明銀號暫停營業公告云、茲據華明銀號經理聲稱、現因市面蕭條銀根緊縮、以致週轉不靈、無法應付、不得不暫停營業、停止收付、一面再行籌商善後辦法、爲特委請貴律師會計師、代爲公告等語前來、據此、合亟代爲公告如上、王思芳會計師、洪士豪律師、四月廿三日、</p>
<h3>地產商發流通券　礙難見諸實行　政府救濟工商已有具體辦法　各方覲察僉認無發行之必要</h3>
<p>本市地產商人、提議發行地產流通券四萬五千萬元、調劑金融、救濟市面一案、因進行困難、雖經該業中人迭次會商、迄尙未曾獲有若何具體進展、而本市有關各方對於地產商人此項建議、亦多認爲碍難實行、絕少贊同、蓋據一般觀察、該項債券不易籌發之原因、固已盡人皆知、卽能見諾實行、則各界人士、對於該項債券能否承受、而亦疑問、若謂救濟市面衰落、活動金融、則政府方面、早已計及、此次二十四年金融公價一萬萬元之發行、卽爲充實中中交三銀行實力、俾得儘量向工商業放欵、以資週轉、財政部近更令飭中·中·交·三行、會同銀行公會、舉辦二千萬元大貸欵、以救工商各業目前經濟困苦之難關、一面並令主管機關、對轉口稅及出口稅之裁撤减免辦法、妥加研究、期於六月一日見諸實行、可見政府對於救濟金融復興市面、無論在治標治本、莫不籌有適當辦法、是地產流通券之發行、誠屬多此一舉矣、</p>
<h3>范予遂來滬　籌商築路借欵　道淸路將展至大名</h3>
<p>道淸路局局長范予遂氏、頃爲計劃將路綫擴展至大名、特晋京謁鐵次曾仲鳴氏、商洽一切、結果頗爲圓滿、范氏復因接洽借欵事、於前晨（二十三日）來滬、與本埠銀行界及道淸路債主英商福公司進行談判、申時社記者特以此事叩詢范氏於旅次、承答如下、</p>
<p>道清路史</p>
<p>范氏略謂、道淸鐵路在河南境、起自道口至沁陽縣止、計長一九七·二三〇公里、管理局設焦作、本路初由英商福公司築迭、爲運煤之用、經我國迭與交涉、乃棤欵九十八萬磅收回、以該路由道口至淸化已成鐵路作爲担保、分二十期還淸、每期須還欵四萬餘磅、幷担付五匣利息、</p>
<p>展長路綫</p>
<p>但該路路綫極短、牧入平淡、每年雖略有廊餘、以之　付責務、甚感困難、故現計劃將路綫擴展至河北大名、此議實行後、預計收入可增加不少、償還價欵、綽有餘裕、建築費預算爲三百萬元、五十萬元由局籌、材料一百二十萬元、可分期付欵、其餘一百三十萬元、則須向外界借欵、</p>
<p>借欵計劃</p>

<h3>暹羅排華種種事實　華僑代表已回國請願</h3>
<p>新聲社云、關於遲羅頒佈華僑教育苛例及限制華僑營業居住等情、雖經過滬該國遠東考察團團長才味爾氏否認、但據新聲社記者、昨續向華僑聯合會及滬僑務局方面探詢、則確有其事、爰將所得各節、續紀如次、</p>
<p>強讀暹文</p>
<p>去年該國政府所頒佈之華僑教育條例、初本規定、凡華僑學校、必須設一所謂强迫班、華僑子弟之七歲以上十四歲以下、必須受該班教育、每週讀暹文二十三小時以上、是項條例、迨至今年加以修改後、乃將該班取銷、而進一步規定、凡華僑子弟、自七歲起至十四歲止、必須逕入該國學校、完全受該國教育、又華僑學校教育、規定必須入該國學校、專讀暹文六個月、經考試合格、取得其教育部所頒發之證書、方准學校延聘、其一次應考不及格者、尙准續讀暹文六個月、再予應考、今則一次不及格後、卽取銷其資格、不再予應考機會、</p>
<p>迫入暹籍</p>
<p>曩年、凡華僑之入暹者、既須每年納所謂助政費暹幣六元、發給一種牌子、其內容竟註明其人已入暹國籍、自民十三年以來、除照繳助政費外、更於初入境時、尙須繳納所謂入口稅、實行之初、原爲暹幣十元、嗣增至五十元、今則更增至一百二十五元之多、</p>
<p>限制營業</p>
<p>華僑子弟之回國就學者、　政府認其爲留學、出境時須繳納所謂按金（卽押金之意）五百元、並限制須若干年回暹、否則其家屬須受處分、凡華僑商店、必須用暹人一名爲雇員、華僑工廠、必須儘量安挿暹人、他如高徵營業稅所得稅、更無論矣、</p>
<p>同化政策</p>
<p>華僑聯合會秘書陳君、旅暹多年、甫徑歸來、據淡、暹入不善經商、凡大企業皆操於我僑胞之手、暹政府以其本國人口甚少、華僑旅暹者多、復覬覦華僑經濟勢力、故頗思施同化政策於華僑、使華僑無形自認爲暹人、而忘却祖國、若限讀華文、强讀暹文、均其手段、近且準備實行認爲凡華僑之在暹生養者、卽認其爲暹國人、</p>
<p>日本勢力</p>
<p>暹國政府、本分民主君主兩派、民主派接近日本、君主派接近英國、今則民主派佔優勢、暹政府有外籍顧問二十三人、前此英人爲多、法美日人較少、今則二十三人中、日人達十八人、可見日本在暹勢力之高漲、其教育顧問卽爲日人、此次所頒華僑教育苛例、良有因也云云、</p>
<p>代表到滬</p>
<p>旅暹華僑、此次因暹國排華、特派代表三人、回國請願、該代表等、早已於日前到滬、並經一度晋京、晋謁當局、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （迺令）</p>
<p>戀愛是美麗的，有詩意的，甜蜜蜜的，這大概已是大家公認了的事。外國某位詩人也曾說過這樣的一句話：「戀愛是至上的；」但是想不到現在的戀愛却是以流血爲最普遍的現象：因戀愛而流血的事實在太多了，現在單指一件新近最轟動的，卽如北平的劉景桂案。</p>
<p>有人說過：富有曲綫的戀愛頂有味，最好還是三角的，四角的，五角的戀愛！戀愛過於平凡了，等於喝一口白開水。又有人說；爲了戀愛而犧牲是頂偉大的事！但是我說：把許多有用的時間和精力，在三角的，四角的，五角的戀愛里翻筋斗，是天下頂無謂的事：至於爲了戀愛而犧牲，那更是倒霉的人’　不相信的話，你試想，像滕爽死得倒霉不倒霉？</p>
<h3>桄榔樹</h3>
<p>— 大廣東</p>
<p>桄榔樹，一條心。』凡是廣束人，沒有不曉得這兩句俗話的。　　桄榔樹，究竟是什麼樹咧？不但外江佬不曾見過；就是廣束佬，也不輕易見得着，祗有省城觀音山三元宮裏面有一株。它就長在三元宮的石級旁邊，是一種冬靑的喬木，樹榦筆挺，扶搖直上，一點兒彎曲也沒有，一直到上邊，才長了一篷大葉子，圓得好像一把傘，旁邊並沒有一根樹枝，這就是『一條心』的說法。在我看見它的時候，已經有五六丈高的樹榦，至少也有四尺的直徑。</p>
<p>它—桄榔樹的下半截，雖然是光光地，沒有枝葉，但是五顏六色的「褲頭帶」却繫滿了樹榦的周圍，而且樹根下還有着成堆的香，和燭，都是些閨中的少婦，因爲伊們的『黑漆板凳』有了外遇，所以在他——黑漆板凳睡了之後，把他的褲頭帶，偷着換掉，悄悄地跑來繫在它身上，於是乎他的心，也就和它的心一樣，是『一條心』單戀着伊，不會再有外遇的了，這種傳說，固然是有點迷信，但是早就傳遍了羊城，一直流傳到現在。</p>
<h3>拜墓</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>爲了紀念死去了的視母和父親，所以每年總要照例地返鄉去拜一次墓的；這雖然在死人未必一會來領情我們這份孝敬，然而在我們也總算聊盡人子之道了。</p>
<p>回到了故鄉，我忙了幾天的行親望眷，母親却忙着製辦一切祭墓所用的菜餚錠箔。</p>
<p>我一年祇返鄉一次，况且日子又是非常短促的，所以我在故鄉的光陰是十分寳貴的。雖則一年的時間並不見得怎樣悠長，可是却也不能夠說是很近的。於是當我每趟的歸去，那些朋友親戚似乎都很親熱，其實在這親熱之中，我却反而感到了不少的生疎成分。</p>
<p>淸明日是掃墓的日子；我們端正好了一席酒餚，呌了幾個村人用十羅琴—貯菜餚的條箱—抬着向墳山上去。記得去年今日，我們拜墓是六個人，母親，姊姊，我，弟弟，妻和孩子，而今年只有五個人了！因爲姊姊已於今年三月八日逝世了！默默的在一塊走着，我已看不見了姊姊，兩行熱淚就像湧泉一般地淌了下來。這次我回來，不獨是拜墓，並且還爲了來替姊姊呌「五七」的。走上墳山，但見祖母父親和哥哥的墓傍又多了一座新墳，我看到這觸目的新墳，就禁不住伏在墳上放聲大哭了起來。</p>
<p>酒餚供在祭桌上，盃筷是很整齊的排列着：可是那裏看得見他們來享受這豐盛的祭禮呢！祇有一堆紙錠已焚變了灰燼。大家拜過了墓，彼此都黯然不則一聲，悲慘的情緒，摧得我這顆幾次受創的心靈比了蛇咬還難受！</p>
<p>哭吧，哭吧！可是已經哭不出來了：我的眼淚不知在什麼時候流乾的？</p>
<p>垂着頭，默默地跪在墓前，讓我這靈魂毀滅在這哀愁的空氣里。</p>

<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>程志前爲了月英這事，費了很大的週折，居然在賬房裏借了幾件女人的衣褲拿了來，他後面就跟着楊浣花胡嫂子和那位掛冠來省的周有容縣長。所以那脚步聲和說話聲，都透着很雜亂。志前笑道；北海，你不知道帳子裏面，藏着有一個人嗎？北海笑道：知道的。我也正爲了有一個人在裏面，恐怕程先來了客的時候，會引起誤會，所以我在這裏替先生看守着客。程志前笑着點點頭道；你的意思，算是不壞。說着他將夾在脇下的一包衣服，交給了胡嫂子，因道；這衣服就由你交給他去穿了。胡嫂子捧了衣服向床面前走，手一抬，正想去掀帳子，月英看到屋子裏有這些個人，如何能容許他這樣做，在床上滾着，口裏怪呌起來。楊浣花笑道；人家是由西方來的姑娘，很重舊道德的，教他當了許多人在屋子裏換衣服，當然是不肯。志前道：還有帳子呢，要什麼緊。楊浣花道；在帳子裏看帳子外邊，那是很淸楚的。他以爲外面着裏面，也是這樣所以他不肯換。志前道；現在雨也住了，我們三個男人，躲開一邊去得了。周有容道；那就到我屋裏去坐坐罷。這位王家小兄弟，實在用功，這樣的雨天，還是照樣的來補習，倒不要躭誤了他的功課，就帶了書一塊兒到我那裏去補習。我自己也找分報看，决不妨碍你們的事。（一九〇）</p>

<p>這句話聼來似乎很奇怪，依我們看來，一雙鞋子上，旣釘着那麼許多的珍珠，又且只有一根很細的絲綫連繫着，怎麼竟會不裂斷，不落掉呢？可是我們只要想到御用這些有珍珠釘着的鳳鞋的人，乃是一位年高的皇太后，我們就會相信這是很可能的了！　非但僅僅是可能的，節直是必然之理！因爲常在那「鞋庫」裏存儲着的鳳鞋旣有數百雙之多，而新製的又陸續在增加，所以每一雙鞋子至多只有給太后穿一次或兩次的機會，甚至一次都不穿；這裏所謂一次，時間是很短的，少則半天或幾小時，多則一天或兩天，從無連穿三四天的事。就是穿在太后的足上的時候，也是靜處的時問多，行動時間少；卽使行動，伊的步子又是極輕極慢的，永無怎樣劇烈的震動，所以任你犯那些珍珠釘得如何之多，如何的不結實，也是斷不會滾落下來的！假使說它們是極易滾落的話，那末在宮內當掃地的太監，個個都好開珍珠舖去了！這話也不是胡講，因爲太后的鳳鞋上，珍珠釘得最多的往往有三四百顆，少則二三十顆，普通總在七八十顆左右；這麼許多的珍珠，只要常有十分之一掉下來，豈不就很可觀了嗎？</p>
<p>若問宮內怎樣會有這許多的珍珠，供太后如此濫用呢，其始當然，都是京內和各地的官府，以及高麗安南等屬國所進貢上來的。（三〇〇）</p>
<h3>鄉鎭</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>我偶而到內地鄉鈸上去巡禮，得到下面的統計：</p>
<p>茶館：佔十分之六；店舖，佔十分之二；住家，佔十分之二。</p>
<p>照這樣看來、茶館子在內地的鄉鎭上，是非常的發達的，然而，在另一方面看來，卻十足的象徵着中國內地的農民，是沒有正當的業餘消遺，以致於造成目下每個鄉鎭上茶館子佔了絕對的大多數的現象。</p>
<p>每天，每月，每年，這茶舖子的生意，總是非常興隆的，有的人以此爲商量鄉務的地方，有的人以此爲賭博消閒之處，更有甚而至於因無法消費這空餘的時問，而悶悶的坐它二三小時的，也是很多很多，咱們中國同胞之不愛惜時間，是一件普遍而不足爲奇的事實。</p>
<p>尤其使我感到有急切改良的必要的，便是目下內地鄉鎮上晚間盛行唱灘簧的取材，大都是淫靡不堪的東西，然而，唯共是淫靡不堪的東西，才深深的抓住了許多鄉民的心理，當天上的星光開始照耀時，他們便絡繹不絕，趕往聽灘　去，男的有，女的也有，天喲，說來眞可憐呢？當他們聽了這種淫靡不堪的所謂灘簧以後，心靈上便起了一個很大的騷動，於是男女拐逃之事，便層出不窮的在內地的鄉鎭上發現着，這又是一個多麼危險的現象！</p>
<p>所以我認爲內地的鄉鈸，實有切實改良之必要，很希望負治平之責者，起來注意這個不成嚴重問題的問題吧！</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>秣陵訪舊記</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>好容易得到幾大的春假，恰巧施張二君來約到南京去，一來可以望望老朋友，二來可以瞧瞧新建設；終年埋頭工作的我，也得來這機會去換換空氣，所以便如約同行。我們動身的一天，朝晨還下着細雨，出城時已大放晴光了。登車後，見田野春景，從車窗中展開着，不覺車路的長了。經過鎭江，遇見張胡程二個熟人，談談說說，一刻兒已到下關，張君便招往白下路酒家，設筵相叙，這是很可感激的！這晚寓大成旅社。</p>
<p>第二天，一大早便到城北訪友，陳吳孫三家，都住九華村，村在中央大學附近，和農塲昆連，半村半郭，好像別有一個幽靜的境界。居宅都是自建新屋，望衡對字，過從很便。屋前都有塲圃，略栽花木，吳家園子裏，蠶豆花開得很盛，大有山家風味。主人治庖供飯，掃榻留宿，殷勤得難以爲情。</p>
<p>在回來的一天，我們到母校中大去遍遊了一周，一切的建設，和以前大不相同了。大會堂的宏麗，圖書館的擴充，氣象一新，便是梅庵一角，也把草廬改建新屋，旁邊多了紀念成吳二烈士的石碑；獨有那六朝松，依舊靑蒼矯健，和那老態頹唐的南高院，相映成趣，動人感喟咧！出校又上鷄嗚寺去遊眺，這是學生時代常到的地方，豁蒙樓頭，風景依然，若坐望後湖，宛如天然圖盡。直到寺儈晚課，山鐘徐動，便下山，出和平鬥，乘晚車歸來，並拉雜記成一詩，得四十韵，聊誌一時高興而已！</p>
<p>徵雨喜新霽，驅車同出城，難得有餘晷，重作秣陵行，汽笛一聲起，携乎快登程。正是春光好，窗外景物明，虎阜塔影遠，鍚山嵐色淸，轉眼京焦過，遙見大江橫。故人巧相遇，促膝話平生，薄暮征車卸，燈火耀晶塋，白下路邊去，歡宴酒滿觥，殷勤東道主，不盡桃潭情。翌晨訪老友，迂迥路不平，九華村前勝，新漲水一泓，悠然絕塵俗，柳陰聞啼鶯，別有一天地，半讀又半耕，卜築何精雅，相對正望衡，塲圃多生趣，瓜架與豆棚。入室饒春氣，主人含笑迎，乍逢道久別，喜極乃轉驚，掃榻留暫宿，治庖享佳羹，剪燭西窗下，話舊到深更。三家時來往，契合若弟兄，海外傳薪早，飽學各有成。秉鐸歷南北，樂育盡菁英。閉戶勤著述，精　負盛名，教政賴參贊，卓卓有佳評。書晝同所嗜，琳琅滿四楹，鑒賞精瓷瓦，珍奇列瓶　。志節矯時習，富貴浮雲輕，深交久愈樂，堅比歲寒盟，吾儕少同學，相見益心傾。城北地淸曠，巍峨見學費，昔年弦誦處，氣象今更宏，重遊尋舊跡，路迷幾若盲，廣厦美輪奐，廿載費經營，梅庵幾變易，松幹老更榮，烈士留紀念，碑題成吳幷，登山腰脚健，古寺訪鷄嗚，指點台城路，警戒常駐兵，豁蒙樓如舊，坐聽晚鐘聲，歸來寫長句，擲筆意縈縈！</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>一萬隻手的高舉有不可思議的效力</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>這幾天白銀問題又緊張了，人家怎樣？我不去管他，且亦無權無力去制止他。千言萬語，只有自己爭氣，只有全國國民一致的咬緊牙關，來幹自救的工作。某經濟家說得好；救濟白銀外流、徒向華盛頓政府交涉，這是他們國策的所在，當然不容易更改的。卽施行平衡稅，也不見得可以奏效，困爲外人利用租界關係，且在華多設銀行，購銀卽不直接起運，功效也是相同。何况年年入超數萬萬、歸根結底，銀子總要外流的。今後國人惟一應付辦法，只有咬緊牙關，拒用外貨。美國是鼓勵對華輸出的國家，失去作用，或用幡然變計的一天。一針見血之談，吾十分贊同。我們今日在求人不如求己的地位，只有大家忍耐此（堅决些來一致的服用國貨）四月十八日那天，記者躬與全市學生宣誓服用國貨典禮，目睹一萬隻手高高的舉起來，同聲的喊出「吾以至誠，誓願從本身起，並勸　導家庭勸導全社會一律用國貨」的誓詞，由這一萬人，每日勸十人，一日可得十萬人，不到一個月而全上海市民可以普逼服用國貨了。這種不可思議的效力，只在大家一致實行罷了。</p>
<h3>我們在宣誓了後</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>要更奮勇地去實幹</p>
<p>時光眞快，在一星期前的今天，我們許多莘莘學生，都正在那擁擠的人群中，熱烈的呼聲中，宣讀過了今後服用國貨的誓詞、當然從此後大家要脚踏實地，各盡其　，身體力行，從實踐的努力中，去爲國產前途開一綫曙光，挽住了將瀕崩潰的我國經濟，不過，事實决沒有這樣簡單，已往的經騐，已吿訴了我們單是餀洞的吶喊？是無濟於事，必須要有切實的計劃，依軌循序的做去，始可生效，因此，在這時候，我便有個熱烈的企圖，望全國學生們在這宣誓了後，要更奮勇地去實幹，以有組織有計劃的程序，使每個學生都有　揮他對愛用國貨的熱忱，這樣，我想本年的成績，一定可以較過去爲滿意了。</p>
<p>但是、在這裏，我尙須殷動企望的，就是每個學校中的敎師們，他們本負有引導學生的責任，在這努力國貨敎育的過程中，實尤須領導一般學生們，實踐那宣誓中的任務和使命，首先從各個學校的自身起，去造成一個服用國貨的模範和典型，爲學生的家庭導，爲整個的社會導，至於如何去着手實施，我也敢提出三點的愚見，供給全國的敎師和學生，大家去採納和實行：</p>
<p>一，在學校的行政上，自本日起，應一律採取服用國貨的原則，無論服裝文具，儀器，設備，以及一切的雜用器具，務須絕對禁用洋貨，並由敎師及學生共同組織服用國貨委員會，頒布獎勵購用國貨條例，如有違反情事，雙方均須受相當的懲戒。</p>
<p>二，在學校的敎材上，應選讀各國貨先進以及工業發明者的言行傳記，和成功史等，而各種關於國貨的定期刋貨，尤須常讀，並多作研究國貨的文字，以資深造。</p>
<p>三，在學校的課外作業上，宜常往各國貨工廠，國貨公司去實地參觀，並每星期舉行國貨講座一次，請國貨名人演講，和利用星期日，學生和敎師互組國貨宣傳團，及懇親會，表演或演講提倡國貨的重要，使做到勸導家庭，勸導全社會使一律服用國貨的任務。</p>
<p>最後，我還要請全國的學生們緊緊記住，那天我們的誓詞是：「我以至誠誓願從本身起，並勸導家庭，勸導全社會，一律用國貨，如有可用之國貨而不用時，願受國人嚴重處罰」！</p>
<h3>杭州的國貨市塲</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>春假中在杭州閑逛了一星期，略略享受些湖光山色的淸福：順便還參觀了兩處國貨商塲。參觀以後，多少總有些感觸，因此寫這篇東西出來。</p>
<p>（一）國貨公司　這公司地址是在湖濱相近，面臨着杭州的大馬路，有兩層走馬樓相似的房屋；靠馬路有着十幾間店面，進了大門，有一個很大的天井，樓上樓下又有幾十間店面。看上去這公司的店面是分租給他人開設的，所以各家仍舊用着自己的舖名。裏頭所售的東西，抗州土產佔十之七八，好像專爲外埠遊杭的人而開設的。那裏邊有個綢緞舖—專賣杭緞和杭紡——茶葉舖，剪刀舖。扇子舖；還有一種雜物舖，是專賣天竺筷，藕粉，念珠等類，也有好幾家；還有紙傘舖，也有四五家，生意倒並不退板。</p>
<p>這一所公司的缺點：（一）房屋太陳舊，一些不加裝飾，引不起人們的注意。（二）各舖各自爲政，好似小舖子的集合處，稱做公司，未免名不副實。不過優點也有一些。（一）各舖爲着生意競爭，價錢並不昻貴。（二）各貨標出價目，沒有討價還價。（三）店員還謙和。</p>
<p>（二）國貨商塲　這商塲在淸和坊，恐怕是臨時擺設的。門口吹着喇叭，敲着銅鼓，十足的上海商店大减價大拍賣色彩。跑進去一看，眞的十之七八是上海來的貨物，哈哈！這眞和上邊所說的國貨公司，站在相對地位。一個是杭州人做別地人的生意；那一處是上海人來做杭州人的生意了。裏邊擺着一個個攤頭，眞和上海城隍廟差不多。出賣的東西，也以廠布，線襪，化裝品，套鞋等居大多數。買貨員也是上海帶下去的，油頭粉面，高視闊步，眞可以嚇倒杭州土老兒。</p>
<p>這一所商塲優點何在？缺點何在？我以上海人的資格，不便加以批評。不過我可以拿一伴目覩的事寫出來：有一個杭州人向某攤上購買線襪，標價是大洋，而這位杭州人還以小洋價錢。這位賣貨員鉛筆向　後一夾，睬都不睬。杭州人又問他聲賣不賣？他鼻子裏哼了一聲，又破口的罵道：屈死，你不如偷了一雙去吧！</p>
<p>賣貨員的謙和不謙和，看是小事，然而影響於營業很大。我希望上海各店舖的店員，趕快革除這件陋習，尤其是國貨公司，更要注意到這點。</p>
<h3>注意集婚新人的衣，帽，鞋，襪</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>上海市第二屆集團結婚，又將有三十四對伴侶，於五月一日假市政府大禮堂舉行了！珠光鬢影，濟濟蹌蹌，點緣此夕陽春光！蔚　盛事！可是新人的衣，帽，鞋，襪，究竟國貨與否？値得注意！吾們知道：國貨界除美亞織綢廠，能利用機會推廣銷路外，其餘寂寂無聞！我很覺得扼腕！因爲有幾點疑問，吾們須提出來討論，禮一帽國貨嗎？皮鞋是國貨嗎？襪子是國貨嗎？即使美亞綢斜，都能全體服用嗎？現常朝野一致提倡國貨的時代！雖小至手帕或內層的襯衣都不能忽略的，如果檢查得有舶來品的新人，該拒絕他倆參加！吾意中國國貨公司應該來服務一下。還有一點，新娘旣奉令禁止燙髮！則高跟鞋和外國脂粉亦應絕對禁止！其次當衆舉乎宣誓結婚後，終身不購用洋貨！誓以至誠，愛國家，愛國貨！如是　纔不愧新生活的集團結婚！</p>
<h3>提倡國貨學生從何做起</h3>
<p>— 大夏大學魏冀徵</p>
<p>提倡國貨是扶危救亡的出路，是富國裕民的要圖，提倡國貨可以發揚民族精神，可以恢復民族固有的道德。於此可見提倡國貨運動，實含有深切之意義，凡爲國民，均宜當仁不讓，奮起提倡，以晚救國家的危亡。</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，將提倡國貨和服用國貨的責任，集中在我們學生身上；這因爲靑年是社會的中堅分子，學生是立在民衆領導的地位，我們很徼幸做了學生，又忝居了民衆領導的地位，故對於這種含有深切意義之國貨運動的救國運動，應登高一呼的振作精神，爲最前綫的衝鋒隊伍！</p>
<p>事實和理論是兩件不同的事，現在不是坐着空口談理論能够挽救國家危亡的時候了！我們祗有脚踏實地的切實去做，纔是目前的要圖，我們是學生，在學生的立塲，對於國物運動的救國運動，也是應注意如何在本位的範圍內切實去做的問題，下面就說學生如何去做：</p>
<p>（一）從今天做起：過去許多救國運動的沒有功效，就是由於虛浮而不着實際，祇知口頭的吶喊，不能躬行實踐，以致因循坐誤一日復一日的過去，所謂議而不決，決而不行，不能得到實際的效果，論語云「過則勿憚改」又云「過而不改是爲過矣」中國經濟的危機，已達極點，這大部份原因，固然是國民不服用國貨的結果，也是國民知過不改的毛病所致，過去的抵貨運動已非一次，終於虎頭蛇尾烟消雲散，現在我們旣然知道提倡國貨，對於民族的興衰，國家的存亡，有如此密切的關係，就當用毅然决然來精神，卽知卽行的「過則勿憚改」地，下最大的决心，從今天開始，從今天做起，以後决不再用洋貨，决不再蹈來日方長因循坐誤的覆轍，人人當存着「苟日新，日日新，又日新」，的信念，全國學生界都是如此，經過今年的學生國貨年後，凡是學生已下了從今日做起提倡國貨的責任，以後誓不再用外貨，而多也不過再來一個國民國貨年，外貨沒有不絕跡，國貨未有不發展的日子。（未完）</p>
<h3>學生國貨年應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 位育小學鄒斯履</p>
<p>現在論何人，都知道我們中國是衰弱極了。但是决不能使牠就這樣地過去，總得想辦法來挽回這危亡的中國。有些人主張：「振興實業」「普及敎育」「擴張軍備」等。的確，這都是挽回中國危亡的方法，但是還有一件事，也是不能忽視的：那就是「提倡國貨」了。</p>
<p>中國人大多數歡喜用洋貨，因此金錢漏去了不少，政府方面看到這種情形，知道必須要有人做提倡國貨之領袖，才能使國人相繼提倡，因此便定下了各種國貨年。</p>
<p>去年是婦女國貨年，結果是失敗了，其失敗原因有幾種：（一）有些婦女只知道買光彩耀目的外國衣服及化妝品等，爲了自己的美觀，而忘了愛國心，（二）大半摩登婦女互相爭妍，都以穿外國貨爲榮耀。普通的婦女也就模仿她們，因此洋貨的輸入數量只見一天一天地增加，還比沒有提倡婦女國貨年時，輸入的數量多，這一來，婦女國貨年便有名無實了。</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，是由我們學生時做領袖，我們都是受過敎育的人，亦爲將來新中國的主人翁。</p>
<p>對於國家的興亡當然要負很大的責任，所以在這學生國貨年中，希望諾位學友努力地提倡國貨。</p>
<h3>我對於學生國貨年的希望</h3>
<p>— 華民小學六年級吳建美</p>
<p>社會的經濟，在一天天發生恐慌。我們要避免這重大的危機，祗有致力於國貨的暢銷。當然，中國人服用中國貨，是理所當然的事　。</p>
<p>可是，眞心肯服用國貨的人有幾個？例如：過去的『國貨年』，『婦女國貨年』，在政府方面，也可算得積極的獎勵國人服用國貨了；但是，可憐得很，惟其提倡國貨，惟其洋貨的入超年年增加。從這點看來，只好說國人太不爭氣了！</p>
<p>好，現在人把『服用國貨』四個字放到我們學生身上來了；因爲學生是有熱血的靑年，而且不斷地在求學識、能够知道現在社會經濟的病態；所以把這副擔子放到我們身上來，是合理的，同時，我們也自認有把握的。</p>
<p>同學們，奮起精神！從今以後，吃的，用的，穿的，非國貨不買，非國貨不用。努力！努力！成績如何？待看明年今日！</p>
<h3>提倡國貨之我見</h3>
<p>— 旦華小學方慧珍</p>
<p>提倡國貨四個字，不知道給人騙去了多少稿費，寫痛了秘書的手，無錢電裏日夜在報吿着；怎樣要服用國貨，但是結果呢？還不是一敗塗地麼？</p>
<p>在每年入超的數目裏，智識份子要負責到半數以上，這一點眞苟我們對那些胼手胝足的農人慚愧得要死，本來一國國民服用國貨，可說是應有的義務，不但學生如此，人人亦要如此，這裏我只拿智識份子來說：</p>
<p>要知道社會上一切人情風俗的移轉民氣消沉的挽救，國家意識的鼓吹，都是隨着智識份子而轉移，要是智識份各能以身作則，勇邁提倡改善風氣，未有不是勝利的，提倡國貨未嘗不是如此。</p>
<p>智識份子在中國人口比例裏雖說不多，但是在銷耗洋貨隊伍裏總算是先鋒兼中堅份子尤其是女智識份子呀！進一步說智識份子是無形中滅亡國家的禍首。</p>
<p>至於提倡國貨的方法，老早給人說盡了，所以我實在說不出張天師似的妙法能挽救國貨危機，我只有一點滴馬後砲的管見：</p>
<p>（一）起而做母坐而空談…尙空談是中國趕不上歐美的大毛病，所以要提倡國貨，只有着重切實去做到，而且要嚴烈的做，凡提倡者應該提倡者當言行一致以身作則督察所屬，一致推進例如學校校長敎職員行政官長等等，應當爲民先鋒，繼續不斷的硬幹，要知道我國自海禁開後，洋貨湧至西洋物質文明的享受，幾成爲國人一生的目的，這麼根深蒂固的惡習，决不是短期裏貼標語呼口號拍兩張八寸全體大會，照相就能收效的。</p>
<p>（二）賞善罰惡…靑年學生們大多意志力弱虛榮心强而且自治能力缺乏，每個人都帶有濃厚的被動性，所以對於這些奴氣的學生們當施以賞善罰惡四字方法，强制他們服用國貨，不得任其自由例如學生在校一律穿着國貨校服，設有　戒不聽學校予以開除懲戒，社會輿論亦一致羣起攻擊，爲着民族利益，怯律對於個人的（指服裝）白由只得暫不予以保護、以求懲一儆百的功效，同時對於服用國貨者，亦予以種種優待，以爲獎勵，如失業者着是熱心國貨者，各機關收用得以優待，或學生熟心國貨者予以物質或名譽上獎勵，要知道好名乃人之常情，提倡者當捉住了這點引人興趣和决心，造成儉德風氣。</p>
<p>總之提倡者能起而力行賞罰分明，不久自然有好結果產生，不然提倡國貨像提倡禁雅片那麼似的，可笑，試問中國還經得起幾年可入超八九萬萬元？</p>
<p>話不在多，貴在實踐，今國人旣知道提倡國貨爲挽救民族危機急務之一，當再三痛覺自勉力行。</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>實業部令工務局自後建設工程，應用國產水泥。</p>
<p>上海市通商四明墾業寗波實業四行舉辦國貨抵押借欵，組織銀團，額定資本一百萬元，創設國貨公棧，及國貨市塲。</p>
<p>實業財政兩部合組傾銷委員會，對於各項進口貨物，均予調查與統計，以便課以傾銷稅。</p>

<p>新豐洋行報吿、昨（二十三日）紐約股市、因多頭獲利了結、徘徊竟日、至收盤時因鐵道股空頭補進、趨勢乃顯呈上漲、鑛股極强、蓋銀價猛升、衆料財部不久即將再行提高國內新鑛銀之價格、同時與杜姆斯鑛之發給紅利二元、亦不無關係、價市參差帶堅、因拆息低微、美政府公債尤挺、小交易所股票平定、全日成交一百二十三萬股、道瓊斯紐約指數如左、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗浮空突出　爲多頭已出籠　本月紗獨見漲</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、跌風又起、緣海外棉市平淡、據市塲言、謂某君之多頭、遠月業巳如數出籠、且有翻空之說、於是一般浮戶羣爭拋賣、故市盤乃顯著不穩之象、但本月份照常收進、最後一槃仍見挺硬、爲一百八十三元、比三月末槃價僅小九角云、</p>
<p>本月紗獨漲一元一</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤各月期一致下落、形勢異常衰弱、塲中賣氣濃烈、因多說某大多頭在遠月將多翻空、對於多頭暫行放棄、於是一般散戶心思恍惚、檯面愈覺鬆濫、結果各月比上日收槃價均跌八。九·角至一元、惟本月份未動、午後開槃、本月份因某君仍上午收盤價漲一元一角、遠月帶漲二·四·角、但現紗交易仍冷淡、賣出梅記一千二百五十包、裕大二千六百五十包、合興一千三百包、仁豐一千四百包、長餘八百五十包、生源一千零五十包、穗隆一千五百五十包、達記一千七百五十包、大昶五百五十包、買進通記八百五十包、大豐一千六百包、錦昌三千六百五十包、元一五百包、長豐二千四百五十包、永大一千一百五十包、信誠一千九百五十包、賡　八百五十包、一日間最高低價及收槃價列下、</p>

<h3>棉花提供有一萬担　外棉價採算又合宜</h3>
<p>棉市本月份爲最後一天、市槃因交貨充足、壓迫而疲、實因四圍環境不佳、海外銀價猛升、標金步步發現新低峯、加之美棉尙跌、以致採換價格更廉、所以棉市前途、難以樂觀也、</p>
<p>本月棉跌落半元</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一致趨跌、形勢又見虛弱、蓋以海外銀價特長、標金重破八百元大關、然美棉市價仍落五磅昔、印棉亦跌一·二羅比、匯兌掛脾放升、外棉採算價趨跌、於是塲中買者减少、市盤乃疲弱、結果各月比上日收槃價跌二·三角、午後開槃本月份顯現不穩之勢、因交貨有一萬担之譜、檯而念懈、結果比上午收盤價跌三角、遠月漲五分至一角、本月份最後）槃價爲三十四元三角、比三月期末槃價高一元四角半、　賣出昌記二千担、裕大三千八百担、大豐三千八百担、合與一千七百担、長餘二千九百担、永大二千七百担、德記一千担、益　　千九百担、益昶一千八百担、長豐二千五百担、買進大孚一千一百担、　昌二千二百担、瑞大一千担、均昶二千二百担、泰昌二千八百扭、畏和五千二百擔、源大二千二百担、澗康一千五百担、恊成一千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>五月期美棉浮多了結　市面尙感穗固</h3>

<h3>糧食　天氣晴暖　期粉浮多出籠</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈平弱不振之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌九角零至一元零不等、坎拿大跌三角七八分左右、當開價時、初以洋麥之鬆落、繼以天時之良佳、近遠各期之浮多、一致回出、而大小各廠、亦微有出檔、故遠期各月份、尤見鬆動也、迨至下午開槃、本月份因接近交割、廠家現貨尙未豐厚、故人心又轉定勢、遠期各月份、則買賣均少、廠拋一停、市氣巳呈盤旋、此後升沉、半看滙率如何、半看天時、天時能否暢晴、如新麥脚地良好、恐又須換一局面也、結果本月份跌半分、五月份跌一分、六月份跌二分二厘半、七八月份跌二分、九月份跌一分半云、</p>
<h3>麥價頻頻下跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份市面、初跌繼定、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌九角零至一元零不等、坎拿大跌三角零、當開價時、以天時已佳、洋麥又跌、故市塲人心、曾見一度衝動、本月份以現麥見鬆、廠家又續有洋麥進口、本麥需要、暫見不貪、故開價已鬆、遠期更爲之不安、開價即跌三五分、後則補空略好、迨至下午開槃、本月份因廠家無意收貨、市續鬆跌、遠期又爲粉市平平、繼續下降、結果本月份跌九份之巨、七八九月份跌四分、現麥市面、以廠胃不貪、喊價又落三五分不等、開山東麥三元九角五六分、頴州宿州麥三元九角四五分、漯河麥三元八角九分、海州大利集麥三元八角七八分、漢口麥三元七角半、次七角二分、由福新去三千包、阜豐去二千包云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、五月份浮多了結、預測西南尙將降雨、致賣風極爲普遍、買方吸收力量、殊感不足、在交割前、市况上漲勢必引起五月份浮多之脫售、</p>

<h3>河米到貨頗爲擁擠　北帮試辦敏黨米</h3>
<p>河米昨日滬南各幫來源、忽見轉多、共到有四十餘號（貨其八千來石）、人心爲之一餒、　塲隨即見呆、市價漸形軟化、結果若各厚粳價跌落一角至角外、而晚稻雖後有威海衛帮包胃動辦五百餘包、然卒以本街胃口殊鮮問津、致亦貶削一二角、陰元貨稀、尙獨帶秀、滬北河下各路到船十八九號、市上各種去路、白粳早市仍然懈淡、價喊短數分、午市另　轉好、致轉挺、早薄稻到貨續有、消胃平淡、價小數分至一角、白元河存仍厚、去貨不旺價小一二角、其餘各貨價帶軟勢、</p>
<p>洋客秈市况、晨間本客去化不旺、蓋　金融影響後、內地帮辦意雖濃、亦有所觀望不前、本街胃口本淡、長江亦擬守小再版、故市面轉形疲軟、繼有北洋帮試辦敏黨米、而江浙內地名帮復又趁平勢辦裝、市又回居站局全日成交洋米一萬二千多包、客秈二百包、去路仍以內地爲主、本街則稍辦高洋米云、</p>
<h3>黃豆市上積存頗厚　到貨續有廠銷不動</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市況、比較前市勢轉軟化、原因餅銷不動、油價乏力、致油廠家取觀望　度、且　下底積充溢、聞車豆尙有三百車、河南豆亦在一萬七八千包左右、並在市塲中傳聞、可南豆有大批可到、數約萬外、致人心轉見虛弱、昨幸有內地油車坊尙採辦、市價立定、但該幫亦因價高而胃縮、照暫時之大勢、因受種種不良空氣迫　、其市或許有小回之形、其餘大連豆有連電牽制、市價平定、漢口豆隨到隨銷、市面穩定、昨成交計開穎州豆一車、價爲三元六角半、全河豆一車價爲三元八角、大述四平街豆一車、價爲四元三角半、安東豆三十六包、價爲五元二角、漢口乍豆二百包、價爲三元九角一、漢口遲豆五百餘包、價自三元七角四至三元六角八、崇明沙黃六十包、價爲三元六角、去路除內地車家外、餘爲本街耳、</p>
<h3>糖市　白糖續降成交仍缺</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金再降、銀根仍緊、受手稀少、趨勢續軟、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白呌十七元三角、比小一角、亦未成交、轉口貨又降二角、爲五元半、略有交易、糖業合作公司標售粵粗白一批、共額爲二千包、標價爲十七元二角至一角、各降一角、但結果僅成交十包、本廠綿白亦降二角、振裕一號爲十六元六角、二三四號照退、交易不多、期貨有怡和開出五月十八日可到之荷粗白一批、計三千餘包、價爲荷幣三元一角半、永興大昌亦叫同價、尙未成交、</p>
<p>另訊、東糖劃盤昨日亦有成交、Yp嘜十七元一角、YT　十七元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市一無希望可言</h3>
<p>海外絲市、紐約橫濱均已稍漲、奈滙票放長、本埠對外貿易諸受影響、蕭條之絲業、猶形寂寞、年來花旗莊口、慘淡異常、英法亦無踴躍望、印度粗絲市塲、巳爲日貨充塞、言之心痛、用戶交易、因綢銷不暢、銀根緊急、亦無市可言、絲價市氣在呆滯中、</p>
<h3>溫州新茶已開秤</h3>
<p>浙省溫州新茶、自谷雨以來、各山業已齊帮開採、因天時晴雨得宜、出品尙佳、製茶號家、以上年紅茶銷路不弱、多數製銷紅茶、將來該路出產、紅茶不下萬餘箱、綠茶僅數千箱耳、連日各山園製出毛茶、頗爲湧旺、頭批新貨、經茶農茶商談判結果、市價做開三十四元、聞身骨次劣者亦須三十元左右一云、</p>
<h3>五金　瓦楞鐵精神渙散</h3>
<p>瓦楞鐵市面、近來異常呆木、建築帮以環境不良、採辦有限、本街生意亦無起色、現市如二十四號每担估十一元五角、比前巳軟疲二角五分、一十六號每祖估十二元二角半、亦小去一角、二十八號每祖祇估十一一元八角半、亦小二角有奇、調查開出祗有二三百祖之譜、較往年此時情形、已减色不少、聞新近東洋貨紛紛裝來、市上存底益覽豐富、而出路如此寥少、因之人心奇弱、</p>

<p>「……在詩集草葉集（Leaves　of　Grass的根底裏，我拒絕一切因襲的題村。現成的修飾，取材於戀愛與戰爭的構想，表現於舊世界的詩歌裏的英雄豪傑，一言以蔽之，單是爲了美的——傳說，神話，浪漫史，婉曲法，韻律，那樣的東西，我一概都不要。在現在繼續成熟的十九世紀人類最多數的普通人及其個性，特別是在現在美國他們的豐富的實例和實際的職業之中，有我所採取的東西。」</p>
<p>一說到詩歌，有許多人彷彿就以祈秘，奧妙，不可捉摸爲牠的特徵。因之，那怕是在現代，在外國也有許多除了那作者自己以外，第二個人絕難了解的詩歌產生。</p>
<p>然而，這位所謂近代民主討人的第一人，世界自由詩的開山祖瓦特，惠特曼（Walt　Whitman　1819-1892）却這樣地吿訴了我們。</p>
<p>惠特曼是從十九世紀的開塲，活到十九世紀的收塲。這個時期，正是美國脫離英國的羈絆，在廣漢的富源上，以超速度朝着資本主義發展的時期。惠特曼是這發展過程中的一個細胞。他是熱情家。他看到這超速度的發展，他的心房在和牠合調地跳動。他非把這些向上的，活潑的，建設的，社會現象發之歌詠不可。這就是他的詩歌的出發，最實際的現實的出發。一切過去的，陳舊的東西，他不要；一切理想的，虛構的東西，他不要，他要的，是「…………人類最多數的普通人……和實際的職業之中」的東西。這是與追求理想，追求「天外的幻影」的詩人們完全相反。我們的時代，在某一點上，和惠特曼的正是相近。我們需要惠特曼的詩歌。他那種完全從現實出發的現實主義的創作態度，就是我們應該學取的第一點。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>「一片草葉，在其偉大與祈秘上，也不下於星辰的運行。」</p>
<p>許多詩人都是討厭平凡，喜歡祈秘，關在象牙塔裏，過其絕對美化的生活。彷彿祗有這才是詩人的唯一架子！然而，惠特曼却絕不是一個這樣超現實的詩人。他最愛平凡，平凡到如一片草葉，他都要說「將世上所有的一切藝術和科學拿來」，放在牠之前，「使其變成無價値的東西而磕頭一。他不但是讚美草葉（自然），他尤其祝福讚美人生。</p>
<p>穿着普通服裝的男女之羣呀，</p>
<p>你們是何等的珍貴</p>
<p>映在我的眼裏！</p>
<p>他在一走過布魯克林的渡頭裏是這樣地歌詠着。他不喜歡奇裝　服，態度婀娜的小姐；他也不喜歡衣冠出俗，油頭粉面的少爺；他不同他們來往，不同他們生活。他老是喜歡「普通服裝的男女之羣」。他不但是喜歡，他還同他們來往，同他們生活。譬如一八六〇年南北戰爭爆發，他在戰地兩年，看護過兩萬多傷兵。而他許多好詩，就是生產在這倘時期。日本的阿部秀夫也就評過他這一點：</p>
<p>「對於他，紐約埠頭的碼頭工人，船夫，馬車夫，是比怎樣的神話的英雄都要美麗的。」</p>
<p>然而，他不是盲目地祟拜和歌詠讚美自然和人生。他是有他自己的人生觀。雖然他的人生觀仍是被限制在當時社會文化發展的條件之下。他在「自己之歌」中這樣地歌詠出自己的本質來：</p>
<p>我接受「現實」，我毫不加以懷疑</p>
<p>首尾一貫地浸透着物質的觀點。</p>
<p>他是用他當時的社會課與給他的認識方法，站在時代的前頭，去觀察一切物象，一切思想，一切生活。不，不但是觀察，他魷是投身在現實的生活實踐之中。他之所以成爲世界偉大的詩人，而爲後人傳誦不休，就是在乎這些地方。而那些歌詠神秘的詩人，轉瞬即逝，也並不是偶然。這是我們該向惠特曼學取的第二點。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>「在世界—阿美利加—的屋頂上充溢着野性地絕呌！」</p>
<p>惠特曼的詩的內容是全新的東西。那是繼續被確立的美國資本主義社會的生活，是站在沒有封建的束縛的豐饒的新大陸上而感覺到自己完全自由的美國新興布爾喬亞底奔放的感情。這個新的內容，必然和從來的傳統的詩形態相矛盾的。然而他不能削足就履。他實踐怎樣的內容要求怎樣的形式，形式常由內容所决定的理論。他很勇敢，他不怕人家的攻擊與謾駡，决然地以他的豐富的內容衝破狹隘的押韻詩形，創造依存於牠自身之內面的韻律（Rhythm）底新的詩形態—自由詩了。</p>
<p>過去的狹隘的，呆板的，押韻的詩形態，譬如中國的五言，七律，七絕等，確然難以表現龐大的題村。而當時美國的布爾喬亞的自由，生活，必然地要求詩歌上的反映。這便必然地使惠特曼打破過去的傳統，創造自由詩。</p>
<p>我國的詩歌，自從白話詩運動以後，雖說是打破了五言，七律，七絕等的束縛，採用了自由詩形，然而到今日爲止，仍未發展至怎樣的高度。且其中產生許多轉　抹角的傾向，如「螂螳爬上牆」，「追求天外的幻影」等等，至現在詩壇上仍有許多只有詩人自己懂得的詩歌出現。</p>
<p>社會要求我們採用更雄大的形式，表現比惠特曼的時代史爲複雜龐大的社會生活，我們多多地向惠持曼學習吧。</p>
<h3>推薦「世界史之地理因素」</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>「歷史上事實的演進，雖然有許多社會的，經濟的原因；但我們再進一步考察一下。則社會的經濟的原因，不能脫離地球而獨立。相反的，這是與地球表面發生着密切的關係。因爲人是地球的勁物，人類的活動，不能超出於地球之外，因此人類的歷史無形中是受到了地理條件的限制。</p>
<p>開宗明義第一章，著畫人就揭　着上面的編著的旨趣，說明歷史與地理的連鎖性。本來，在我們習慣上很多是把史和地混爲一談的；敎師在課室裏講授歷史的時候不能離開地理，講地理的時候，也有時需要連帶的引及歷史；可是從來中國的史地書籍，却老是絲運而藕斷彼此分立，這是多麼納悶的事？這裏我便引起了介紹這本新著的動戰來了。</p>
<p>這册日本式裝璜的十六開大小的，厚不過二分之一吋的毛邊書，印刷得怪可愛，不久開始陳列於書店櫉窗的一世界史之地理因素」，它的編制完全以歷史爲經地理爲緯的綜合的乎怯，正如作者听聲明的，「……本書叙述的對象，主要爲地理因素在歷史中的轉變；所以關於歷史具體的資料，當然比較的說得不充分……」，因此我們便不能眞的當一本呆板的歷史去認識它，同時也不能眞的當一本呆板的地理去認識它，因爲這是史地的化合物，並不是混合物，乃是另有一種獨特的風味，如果忽略了這意義，無疑的會給你一個嚴重的失望。</p>
<p>同樣，我們看它的編制從第二至第五，儼然着重於歷史的縱的叙述，以後却又似乎注力於橫的剖析，都不大近於一般史地的分法的，而尤其重要的，無論爲歷史爲地理的論述批判，都已某一標準爲取捨，並不怎樣拉雜，這就是作者無時無地不把握住重要生產力與生產手段的改進爲其中心。這樣，作者的社會科學的頭腦所繪出的這本史地化合著，我們認爲在這時代是對於史地科學極需要的整理。</p>
<p>說到這書的內容，原是很豐富的，因爲作者於史地之外，却包含着幾倍的政治的經濟的知識，而且寫得似乎更得意。只要看第六節「現代世界之特徵」及以後各節，對於世界政治與經濟的演化提示了若干的明晰原則，娓娓說來，何會純粹是地理的因素？倘使我們說它是國際政治史或世界經濟沿革史，恐怕作者也不能不部分的承認吧。於是，我敢大膽的推薦給一般的社會科學的研突者們，倒比較推薦給單純的爲一初學開登堂入室之門」之史地研究人們更起勁了！</p>
<h3>城堭廟素描</h3>
<h3>山中牧歌（四）</h3>
<p>— 艾</p>
<p>頭上金簪係哥打，</p>
<p>肚中娃娃係哥里。」</p>
<p>隨即改換成女人的聲調，唱着回駡的曲子，</p>
<p>「三位大嫂過河東，</p>
<p>中間那位是你奶！</p>
<p>頭上金簪係爺打，</p>
<p>肚中娃娃你投胎！」</p>
<p>老徐聽得笑了老來，還說你再唱一個吧，老陳側着身于回過頭來看看秦老板，見他現出一副不痛快的臉子，兩股眉毛直向鼻樑拉得緊緊的。便回答老徐道：</p>
<p>「好，再來一偭吧！」</p>
<p>就將自己的喉管咳嗽了一下。</p>
<p>「妹嬌娥，</p>
<p>憐兄一個沒憐多！」</p>
<p>剛唱出這麼兩句：忽然前面有人搶着唱道二</p>
<p>「哥囉，</p>
<p>三天兩個不爲多！」</p>
<p>接着那人哈哈地大笑着，同時龐大的身子從路邊樹蔭處現了出來，敝露着紅銅色的胸膛，眼睛亮亮地照耀着來人。身邊放着一條木棍子。老陳和老徐都一齊着了一驚，互相望了一眼，便停下足步，兩人剛才的興趣和嬉戲，通在這個漢子的面前忽地消失了。漢子却繼續笑着向老陳說道：</p>
<p>「老哥，怎麼不唱呢？唱呀…息息吧！」</p>
<p>「我唱得不好，哪敢在你老哥面前丟醜哩？」老陳的機智又立刻回來了，便又向老徐說道：「好，就息息吧！」他懂得在一些不好惹的人前面，能够有講朋友的機會，就應該盡量地去抓着。隨卽放下包袱，把牠當成凳子那樣地坐着，一面從懷裏取出裏好的旱烟來，客氣地送一枝過去。</p>
<h3>信與永生</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>「我實實在在地告訴你們，那聽我底話，又信差我來者的，就有永生，不至於定罪；是已經出死入生了。」</p>
<p>「我實實在在地吿訴你們：信的人有永生。」</p>
<p>「……不信的人得不着永生。神底震怒常在他身上！」</p>
<p>這是對於信仰底作用的最文明的解釋。這種嚴詞厲色裏面，除了有宣傳意味之外，自然還有恐嚇的意味。不過只是「信」，就不會再碰到什麼倒霉事，一切問題都解决了，做起來是很容易的。在中國，維持神的信仰决不能這麼簡單，這麼潦草。第一，我們是多神的，想和各方面的神仙佛鬼都保持親密的關係，需要多量的金錢，時間，和一付極强的記憶力；第二，我們是「親族主義」的，信仰神决不會單單爲了自身的永生，還得替生存和已死的親族設法，使他們不受一點痛苦，卽是一個家庭裏面只要有一個人有了信仰，其餘的縱使爲非作壞，也仍然會得到永生。中國的民族實在是更寬大，博愛，可親的。</p>
<p>我有一個不知什麼呌做幸福的姑母，繼續把她底信仰維持了三十年，從來沒有一次替自己打算過。她底求神拜佛完全是爲了別人的。在第一個十年裏，她還是一位姑娘，在家要做點供給舞台和神廟用的金綫刺繡手工，那個時候是爲了父母；其次的十年她爲了她底丈夫而拜神，但她底男人——一個海關雜役，後來成爲抬轎夫，最後成爲小偷——在窮困，疾病，失業底下輾轉磨死了；最後，最虔誠的十年她給了她底獨生的兒子，而那年輕人在一間臨時製彈廠作工，右眼受了傷，瞎掉了，隨後在拉俠的時候被拉了去，不知所終。</p>
<p>我底姑母是一個眞心信神的女人，跟普通那些狡詐自欺地向神人們施行賄賂的完全兩樣。她把所有神誕的日子記得一點不漏，關於拜神的事情她一點都不疏忽和怠慢，盡可能地把所有的金錢獻給神佛們做寳燭和香油的費用，每年一定吃幾許天數的素齋或淸齋，勤懇地向那些人類底支配者許下多少心願，每次稟神都詳盡而且眞誠。在三十年的長期間嘉，沒有做過一次褻凟神明的事。</p>
<p>有一個晚上，我　見她在禱吿上天的時候這樣說着：</p>
<p>「……我已經稟過三十年了，菩薩到底聽見了沒有呢？是我不够誠心麼，還是我底罪孽太重了呢？給我一個回答吧，我這樣哀求過三十年了……」</p>
<p>我一留心她底行動，於是發覺她每天日裏還是一樣做着敬神的事，但每天晚上她都嘮叨地質問着上天。爲了安慰她底動搖的痛苦，我這樣說了：</p>
<p>「……所以咯，全是白費了的！一個菩薩永遠不會回答一個凡人。」</p>
<p>「快點不要作孽，你已經多多衝撞了！菩薩底回答就在我們人底身上顯出來。要不是這樣，虧得我常常敬神，恐怕我自己老早就一命歸陰了。一</p>
<p>她用手掩住我底嘴巴！而這是第一次我聽見她關懷到自己。</p>
<p>憑着智識去使一件事情成功，是非常困難的。但憑着幻想去巴望，不管能否成功，却非常容易。一個乖巧的人當在這兩者之中從事選擇的時候，大槪不必怎樣考慮。一個完全缺乏了智識的人呢，無從考慮，他除了倚賴別人的智識之外，便只好倚賴幻想。幻想能養成貪婪，能給人以無豬的，永遠追趕不上的希望，這是可怕的；又能冲淡人們底憂愁，磨平可以做爲奮鬥底紀念的傷疤，使成爲一塊渾沌無端的頑石，這是更可怕的。</p>
<p>因爲有着社會的　繼，人類底活動已經是永生的了！</p>
<h3>跳舞馬拉松</h3>
<p>— （美國JT法來耳作）（四）宜閑譯</p>
<p>「跳舞馬拉松」在支加哥南市一個公共跳舞廳裏舉行着。跳舞廳的中央安排着一個圈子，有一橫頭是奏樂的臺。圈子周圍是包廂的座位，包廂後面是一排高似一排的白色的條凳。開幕式當作非常的盛典描寫在各處的廣吿上。報吿員從擴音機裏報吿一番，穿着小禮服的贊助人和公正人也向全屋子的人。演說一番。競賽者一一給他們介紹過了，有幾個——可是太克司不在內——便向羣衆和全美國的無綫電聽衆演說。這在太克司看來，雖有些惶窘，却是全新的，前途光明的景象，他一面在地板上轉着走，一面覺着同他初到美國的幾天一樣的心慌，一樣的不自在。然而這是引他到天國去的。</p>
<p>競賽　盈盈的開塲了。競賽者每十分鐘裏跳舞三分鐘，此外就在地板上轉來轉去的走，每一小時裏他們有着十五分鐘的休息。好一個爽心悅目的光景！他們給這許多人看望着，吃着當前的，夾肉土司，喝着常前的咖啡，受着醫生們看護們的照顧，眼看着一班人同自己一樣都指望在這競賽終了的時候得到五百元以及一個大名聲。每逢競賽者彼此談天的時候，太克司就聽得他們幾次三番說到一句話——出名。出名的人物是重要的，好像傑克但怕賽和電影的明星。競賽者大家都想　一個出名的人物太克司也一樣，他斷定着自己總會出名的。</p>
<p>太克司一直沒有想像到有誰能够像這樣的跳舞到一星期以上，一直沒有想像到他也許要過了失眠的困倦的一星期，才可以得到錦標。不到二十回不到，他就覺得這勾當比他所預料那樣還困難，他咬緊了牙齒，决定着不使自己落選。可是他却也懊悔着加入這競賽。他巴不得回到水菓店和飲冰室去做事，照艱難的時勢沒有到來的時候一樣。他巴不得回到希臘山間去做個牧人，那邊他的老母親一輩子住着呢。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我國留學生學習法政者何多</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>日前本報敎育欄，登載一張我國最近五年來出國留學人數與科別統計表。從這張表裏，我們可以看出，近幾年來，我國出國留學生，已傾向兩種趨勢。一種是，出國留學人數，年少一年（有一兩年是例外。）另一種是，出國留學生的科別，以學習法政者爲最多數。前一種趨勢，原因雖不一，無疑總逃不出經濟不景氣的影響。這可不須提牠。後一種傾向，顯然是一般留學生信理的反映，充分說明我國靑年學子，是怎樣希望著有一個機會踏入政界去露頭角。</p>
<p>當然，事實亦不能一槪抹殺。這些出國學習法政的留學生，依個人性之所近，要作深切研究的，並不會沒有。但其中因羨慕虛榮，貪圖富貴，抱做官目的者，恐也不在少數。</p>
<p>在中國，做官的確是最上算的。大官不必說。卽使小官，地位旣高人（普通一班人）一等，出路又比各途多。只要你手叚靈活，向上爬是很容易的，雖則不幸也有幾個倒跌下來，一輩靑年看透了這一層、於是他們出國留學，不管本人對於法政這一門學問，有沒有趣味或心得，都勉强把牠選來讀。爲的希望他日學成返國，得謀取一官半職，以酬十載窗下的苦心。這想就是向來我國留學生學習法政者之多的由來。</p>
<p>其實留學生這種心理是錯誤的。一個留學生所負的使命，不能僅僅爲己，而是要爲人。他應該把個人的利害看得輕，把社會國家的利害看得重。故當他要出國去留學的時候，就須先觀察一下本國的情形，看目前社會所需要的是什、麼，然後酌量自己的能力，去奮發用功，以便取人所有，補已所無，對於社曾國家，提供一點貢獻。這才是一個留學生應有的本分。若一味以個人的利害爲前提，則社會又何必用另眼去看待他呢。</p>
<p>我國現今所缺少的是，各種科學知識和技術。要救今日的中國，也只有科學最有效用。故我們極願今後我國之出國留學者，一　從來傾向學習怯政的心理，向外國多帶點本國所需要的科學知識和技術回來。</p>
<h3>榴槤上市的季節</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>榴鏈上市的季節，太陽開起了大輪的金花，把無窮　的熱度吐到山與水的中間，於是：人世間的溫情是沸一般地騰起來了。在一些榕樹林與椰林的深處，少年人貪戀着火一般的夢與語句，而老年人則在瞑思中飛一般地趕着去追取過往的浪跡，一陣熱氣毫不退讓地向着那失掉了靑春之豐滿的乾臉上冲上來了。笑了笑，掉起頭看着半天的灣灣的月亮，那，可像好多年前的俏姐兒的眉毛呢。</p>
<p>可是現在，時間剝奪了人世間的靑春，「好的時候是已經失落在陳舊的灰色的回憶中了！」</p>
<p>圖像（黃金一般地閃耀着的過往之圖像啊！）還不是像昨日一樣淸楚地存在着嗎？這天空（蔚藍色的，飛翔着三五點海鷗的水面的天空，）這幽暗的神秘的，又被少年男女當作靑春之聖地的椰樹林，這黃金色的柔美的月芽，這夾在六弦琴之抖動中的少年人的歌聲，（有着濃烈的可可與椰子味的黑人的戀歌是像安置在彈璜條上的小夢一樣的。）這海，這烈味的烟草……</p>
<p>從椰樹林走向東去，在那兒年靑的夥子是死命地貪戀着粗豪的六弦琴與熱帶的姑娘的黑色的笑的，人把應時的豐盛的榴槤放在自己的攤子，人買來了去換女孩子的櫻紅的笑，人驕傲地歡笑着：「又是榴槤上市的季節了呢。」</p>
<p>「又是榴鏈上市的季節了呢。」這眞是一個多奇妙的夢啊，難道這過往的好的日子便眞的是一塲不値的誇耀的夢嗎？——誰相信？</p>
<p>（不錯，自家兒年靑的當兒，是也有過她底櫻花一般的笑，與榴鏈上市的季節之熱度的？）</p>
<p>還是一個什麼都不知道畏縮與懼怕的孩子呢——可是到了現在，卽使在同樣的椰樹林裏，也已經成了一個安分怕事的老人了——在靑靑的年紀中，愛熱帶的椰子的濃烈的氣息，愛黑人味的六弦琴，也愛戴着猩紅的榴槤花的，用怕人的愛戀來熏炙人的熱帶的女孩子。</p>
<p>可是，自家兒是在水鄉裏生長起來的人啊，無窮盡的日子全是消磨在褐色的波濤與空曠的蔚藍的天空下面的；有着一個跟水花一樣飄流的身體，也有一個跟身體一樣諷流的心。</p>
<p>便每天帶着這先天性的飄流的心，無休止地浮浪着。終於，在一個太陽開起金色的大花朵的日子，在一個炎熱的榴鏈上市的季節，這沒有主子的流浪的心，却給一種不可知的命運拉到這熱的椰子林裏來　息下了。</p>
<p>跟着無數的年靑人一樣，當一顆不値錢的心找到了一個適宜的主子——一個有着櫻色的笑的主子的時侯，便也向市塲上去買了正上市的榴槤子，買了抖動着人的心臟的六弦琴，在一個適宜的椰子林中把流浪的聲音對着自家兒的黑色的戀人唱起來了：「嫁給飄流的人吧——不要怕，我是會回來的啊，當榴槤上市的時候。」</p>
<p>但接着來的，便是無邊的流浪了呢……）</p>
<p>一樣的榴鏈，一樣的六弦琴，但自己的鬢髪是已經白了啊。</p>
<p>別再去聽人家的靑春的歌吧，對一個飄在生活的海中的流浪人，這不過楚一種誠實的謊話而已。我是允諾過一個人的：「當榴鏈上市的季節，我是會回來的啊。」</p>
<p>而現在却又是榴鏈的季節了呢。…</p>
<h3>太陽底下的事情</h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>大淸早，長福婆婆剛對了太陽唸完了作爲已經虔奉了三十六年的每天的常住似地咕起了多縐紋的下顎，彷彿依舊對着許多好奇而多事的「尖嘴婆」那麼地夾了夾眼睛，獨偭兒　咕起來：「啊呀，呮呮呮，罪過罪過、靑靑白白的太陽底下，幹這種事情！光天大太陽，自家的男人病在牀上哼，却就平白地跟店老倌鑽進房裏去啦！偌，到底是「洋塲」上帶來的不會有好貨，全是跟番婆子那裏學來的怪相啊！呮呎呮，罪過噢！」</p>
<p>那麼嘰咕着，全根娘子的黑黑的「瓜子臉」與矮矮的壯健的身驅便又像梗喉的魚刺那樣地在眼前閃耀了。</p>
<p>全根娘子的來路，在這一村裏的人看起來是着實有點「不明」的，全根家裏本來又沒多少「產業」：一間半房子，門前除掉了老爹的墳塲，還多那麼三四分菜地；此外，就祇剩一個七十多歲的半聾的老媽了。全根自己是個「巴結」的傢伙，「手輕腳健」，吃得做得的漢子：年紀也快三十了，沒有婆娘，却一點兒也不浪；平常在上海一家織造廠裏做工，要不是逢年逢節是難得回來的，「在上海走走的，這樣老誠的小夥子是少有的啊！」村裏的人，要不是那樣說的才怪呢。</p>
<p>可是就在那一年，上海打起仗來了；全根廠裏停了工，回到村上去，時候，那邊却多出了一個黑黑的，身材不大的女人，有一副靈活而不像是懶惰的手脚、兩只稚氣而坦白的眼睛，儘是好奇地瞧着人，人也好奇地瞧着她。</p>
<p>全根當着大家說這是他自己的女人，「是憑中憑媒用紅綠花轎抬來拜過堂的，」跟着便又帶了大紅帖子的婚書去見村長，村長也沒有說話。那麼着，大家便也相信了全根的話，也把那個女人呌作「全根娘子」了。</p>
<p>全根娘子的做人是怪好的，村裏的大部份的人都和她很合得來，只有那個吃長齋修行的長福婆婆是例外，人家越跟全根娘子好，她就越氣她，每天只是捧了佛珠趕着她底後形駡：「洋塲裏來的，有哈好種咾，有……」</p>
<p>可是就只三年還不到哩，長福婆婆可得意得不得了；因爲，她所咒駡着的話居然應騐了：三年來全根找不到工做，浪着，又生了年多的不死不活的黃疸病，而且又有了一個十八個月的男孩子。男人家倒在牀上了，但一家人是照舊要找東西來吃的，那麼着，哭了又哭，到了眞正沒有法子的時候，全根娘子便和鎭上開米店的那個胖子搭上了。</p>
<p>消息第一個傳出去的是長福婆婆，針一般的句語當傳到了躺在牀上的全根耳朶裏的時侯，當晚就發了狂一樣地拿女人一頓打，全根娘子哭了一個整夜，到第二天天一亮。就悄悄地開了後門跳到小河裏去了。</p>
<p>然而長福婆婆的得意是不容易忘掉的，每天淸早唸完了四十九遍「阿彌陀佛」。一想起全根娘子，魷好像是感到了一種光榮似的，笑，而且和唸佛一樣的　咕起來了：「我早就說的，洋也會出好種？大太陽底下就……不唔，大太陽底下……」</p>
<h3>石公山之春</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>在船上足足登了二個鐘頭，纔行進了石公港；我們跳上了岸頭，才把胸頭給壓迫了許久的一口氣輕鬆地舒展了一下。我爲了怕坐船的綠故，所以便主張走回去；於是當艦家說：「先生，我們在這兒等吧！」的時候，我們便乾脆地打　他先自回去了。</p>
<p>七灣八轉的走過了一個村落，兩傍使都是桃杏梅林；那是吐葩的正在吐葩，盛放的正在盛放，而凋謝結實的已經凋　結實了。踏着一條碎石子的羊腸小徑走去；平穿的是皮鞋，我和淸却着的皮底鞋，所以哭篤喀嚓的不諧和的步調，不斷地在我們脚下奏送，引得一般鄉婦村姑們見了我們，都不免丟一個好奇的眼光在我們臉上。走上山麓，一座照牆突然地隊住了去路，我們轉過照牆，就是一條鋪得整齊的山路，兩邊道傍全是巖壑壁立層峯疊翠的奇石，和綠蔭蔽空，蒼翠欲滴的大樹。過歸雲洞，瞻仰了巨大的石送子觀奮像；洞口有對聯一</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>副，十把這裏的風　館活　的寫在筆　：「歸雲洞口雲千疊，明月灣頭月一輪。」洞的對過有石波螺一，據說吹出聲來杭州都可聽得的，可是淸去用盡氣力的吹，也沒有發出什麼聲來。</p>
<p>我們站在節烈祠前貞節牌坊下，遠眺波平如鏡的太湖，湖中羣山隱約，惟有莫釐山的面目十分淸晰。</p>
<p>闖進寺裏，淸在大殿裏跪在觀世音面前求了一支籖，取來一看，却是一支中平　；這時平又似牧師斥他的聖徒般的說他孩子氣了。</p>
<p>「來鶴亭」上有很多名人題書，乾隆皇帝已留了一個御筆大「佛」字：這裏有一副對聯也寫得不錯，可我現在只記得「鶴曾來處亭猶古」的一句上聯了。在「湖照樓」上，平題了年月姓名及「到處一遊」在石壁上，我們便回到「翠屏軒」裏去休息。少停和尙獻上香茗來，於是我們又在「秋爽齋」裏品茗談了一回心。</p>
<p>淸攀籐附葛的從千丈懸崖上採來了一握黃蓮豆，平也想上山去，却因他穿了皮鞋，所以溜滑得站不穩脚，雖然已爬在半山，然而却上不上下不下，實在有些駭怕；結果還是淸去扶了他下來。從「一綫天」過去便是「雲梯，」我們就循着梯階回到了寺裏，平並謝了和尙一塊錢茶金，便各人懷着一顆輕快的心跨出了寺門。在歸途中，沿途還欣賞了許多鄉村風景，那鄉姑的樸實和村童的天眞，很使我們歡喜。</p>

<h3>「維他命」是什麼？</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在近年來的報組上，常常看到許多藥品的廣告，他們多說那藥品裏含有多少的「維他命A」，或「維他命C」。等等，並說那些「維他命」對於人又是多麼有益，吃了它可以促進人的健康。我看見了這些話，很覺不大明白：這種「維他命」是不是藥品？還是什麼食品？是不是對人有益？「維他命A」和維他命C」有什麼分別？這些問題，別人都不能給我一種明確的答案，所以只好來請敎先生了。不過先生會不會因爲問題太瑣碎了，而討厭我呢？敬請</p>

<p>編者按：維他命西名Vttamin，係音譯：科學界多稱爲「活力素」。此素爲輓近發見含於食物中之新營養素。吾人如以食物中之一般所謂營養素，如蛋白質，脂肪，碳水化合物等用化學方法提取純品，調合適當分量，以飼養動物，决不能使動物完全發育。故知食物中尙含有其他要素，爲營養上所必不可缺，此要素旣有促進生長發育之能力，並有抵抗特種疾病之功效，故名之活力素。現由研究之結果，已發見六七種功效不同之活力素，最重要者有下列五種：</p>
<p>（一）活力素A（Vitamin）—魚肝油，牛乳脂卵黃油中含量豐富，豚脂及植物性脂肪中則缺乏之。可溶於脂肪，故亦稱脂溶性A。較能耐熱，但在高溫中易受氣化而破壞，如在低溫（四十度）中則雖使乾燥，仍能存在。它能預防濃血毒病的發生，並有抵抗乾性眼結膜炎之特效。</p>
<p>（二）活力素B—米糠之中含量頗多，其他豆類，穀類，及菜蔬等亦含有之。可溶於水，故亦稱水溶性B。對於熱及藥品之抵抗力較强，在百度不受弱酸之影饗，但抗齡之力極强。有抵抗脚氣病之特效。缺此素者，體重日减。</p>
<p>（三）活力素C—含於蔬菜及果實中，尤以檸　，柑，橘等含量爲多。可溶於水，抗熱力極弱，尤以氣氣存在時爲甚，故加熱烹調，卽易消失。有抵抗壞血病之特效。</p>
<p>（四）活力D—魚肝油中舍量蟲多。可溶於脂訪，抗熱力較强有抵抗佝僂軟骨病之特效，並可增加人　抵抗結核症之能力。</p>
<p>（五）活力素E—存於植物，尤以小麥胚油中爲多。可溶於脂肪。爲生殖腺之發育及作用上之必需之要素，有抵抗兩性不育症之力。</p>

<p>開篇「尋魂」</p>
<p>世間好物不常留。馬嵬坡紅粉葬荒郊。風流天子悲無限。命力士尋魂到處求。乾坤遍境無踪跡。不知豔魄香魂何處游。安得返魂香一炷。眼前聊解上皇憂。五嶽三山皆閱　。偶觀海上起層樓。幸遇仙姑來指引。說貴妃魂在此中留。一步一恭登玉殿。誠心稽首訴根由。聞說長安天使到。整衣裙合掌啓雙眸。深深檢衹頻頻謝。深感君王爲妾愁。金釵舊物煩呈上。親奉開元天子收。倘然不信卿家奏。只要說曾經七夕拜牽牛。此情無有人知曉。願生生夫婦結鸞儔。恨終身福薄未曾修。歸見上皇煩寄語。說重逢時節在中秋。天上人間離咫尺。不妨再向月宮游。重訴新愁與舊愁。</p>

<h3>加雷古柏所說的影星怕見新聞記者的理由（下）</h3>
<p>— 紉琴</p>
<p>你或者對於一個女子，很佩服她很喜歡她，但却不一定會想到要娶她爲妻。同樣的，一個女子和你同出去而很快樂，但她却沒有夢想到要嫁給你。到了人家提出了你要不要娶她的問題的時候，你如果說：「不！」那你簡直是個不知禮貌的混蛋，並且於那個女子的面子，亦太不好看了。倘若你說：「是的！」如果你不是謊言暑，就是傻一個瓜了。但是新聞記者那裏能了解你的爲難呢</p>
<p>當我結婚的時候，因爲我的妻並不是電影界的人，所以我就關照了宣傳部，如果有人來訪問，請他們先聲明在談話之中，不要提到我的婚姻問題。來訪問的人，起初是滿口答應的，但是等到他踏進了我的化妝室之內，態度就兩樣了。他們往往問着：「你的新夫人比你所認識的某某女士怎麼樣？」這眞使我光火了，但我又不能將他推出去。這種不守信實的記者，就是我所深伯的。</p>
<p>在我結了婚，不過三個星期之後，就有許多新聞記者來問我，對於婚姻的意見等等。其實，一個人結了婚五十年，未必就對於婚姻有什麼了解。叫說什麼話回答他們呢？</p>
<p>也有一件事，足以使電影演員對於新聞記者厭倦的。當你初進影界的時候，你的知識當然是有限的。新聞記者來了。他們呌你說這個，說那個。你爲審愼起見，就拒絕了，囚爲你覺得許多話不便公開的說。但是他們擔保，你說了他們决不發表。你相信了他們，終是，好吧，你就一五一十的說了。不久，你的談話竟完全在報上披露了。你良己讀了，知道上了人家的當了。他們弄得你像一個「長舌婦人。」慢慢地就有人寫信來問：「你知道你是誰呀？」</p>
<p>還有許多新聞記者喜歡做的事。譬如說，一位新聞記者問你爲什麼要做某件事。你吿訴了他。他回答說他不明自。爲了要使他了解你的思想，你就吿訴了其他許多有關係的事情，但那些事情都是你不願意公佈的一部份，確是最重要的一部份，而那位新聞記者所覩口答應的話，却已忘記在九霄雲外了。</p>
<p>新聞記者還有一種毛病，就是他們胸有成竹的來訪問你，他們沒法使你講他們所要你講的話，而完成他們自己的用意。譬如說，一位新聞記者來問你，你吃雞蛋的時候，喜歡吃蛋黃呢？還是蛋白呢？他問的時候，已經早有打算，要叫你說喜歡吃蛋白的。倘使你也說喜歡吃蛋白，當然他覺得正中下懷，無話可說了。但是，倘使你倒喜歡吃蛋黃的話，他一定打岔話的話道：「不錯的，但是，你相信不相信……」當然，你覺得不便太抵　他，况且這亦不是什麻大不了的問題，於是就點頭答應了一聲。倘使你過了一回，又表示你遠是喜歡蛋黃的話，他一定又打岔道：「你剛才不是說……」這簡直使你不得說話的機會。等到那篇談話發表之後，他所要說的話，一概借了你的嘴說出來了。這種豈有此理的事，亦是數見不鮮的。</p>
<p>以上所說的，還不過係電影明星們畏懼新聞記者的理由的一部份。凡做到了明星的地位，他們的生活不得不顯得比較平常人奢華些。汽車哩，游泳池哩，網球塲哩，成羣的僕役哩。這些東西都是有連屬關係的，但是新聞記者却管不了。他們喜歡挑檢某一件事，某一件東西，來批評或揣度你們。我在沒有事做的時候，喜歡穿了舊衣服，隨隨便便的坐臥着。公司方面告訴我，我應當在大衆面前，稍爲顧全些觀瞻。於是我就呌了一個裁縫來，替我裁剪了許多套衣服。剛巧那個時候，我從歐洲回來，於是外面立卽起了謠言，說我有某種社交的企圖哩。我　備一輛新汽車，購買一付新馬鞍，一些極平常的事，給外面知這了，都會引起許多謠言的。</p>
<p>常許多用星們聚在一處的時候，他們的談話常常會提到雜誌，新聞記者，訪問等等問題的。我發現了他們的意見，和我的大最相同。我們知道訪問的價值，因而重視來訪問的人。但是我們亦和平常人一樣，有許多私人的事，不願公開討論的。可是你越是不願意講的，新聞記者却越要討論和追究。</p>
<p>到了後來，我祇有兩條路好走。一條路就是儘他們去講，抵配讓大家將話看作一個傻瓜混蛋。還有一條路，就是建築起自術的墻垣，拒絕一切的新聞記者。兩者都有它的弊病，但是我却不得不走了第二條路。不過我覺得我應當先聲明我的理由。我的理由，亦就是我許多朋友和大多數電影從業者的理由。並不是我驕　，忘舊或者搭架子，實在是迫處於此，不得不然也。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「沉寃」</h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Mystery　of　Edwin　Drood　—大上海</p>
<p>迭更斯的作品搬上了美國電影，到現在眞不知多少次了。</p>
<p>關於他，在中國無論是文學與電影兩方面，都應當是讀者諸君甚爲熱悉的人物。特別是在今年，從「孤兒流浪記」一直到以前不久開映的「塊肉餘生」，人們對於他總算有着相當明確的認識了。</p>
<p>在「沉宛」的故事中，原著者是意識的揭露之隱藏在神慢後的唱詩班聖徒的詭詐。道是一部人描寫人性的作品，然而人們却會殘忍的批判那主人公性格的變換，並不能使人充分的覺得他是眞實的人，原因是人們不能在其周圍的生活環境中，充分的認出他性格變換的必然性，除了他的痴情單戀之外，不會給與人們更多的體念。因此，這裏祇有曲折離奇的情節，然而這是類似傳奇的，很少有其實感的。在三十年代的人們看來，對於這故事大概不會覺着多大興趣罷。</p>
<p>這一大學作品是作爲偵探影片被採用着的。電影商人的嗅覺的確是靈敏的了。不過，値得人們歡喜的却是劇作者和導演充分的保持了文學電影的風味，這無論是在畫面的構圖或劇的零圍上。我敢向讀者諸君介紹，假使你多看了美國的恐怖影片或偵探片，那末作爲偵探片的「沉寃」固然不見得能使你十分滿足，但是假使你很愛好文學電影的話，從這一影片中你將體念着在銀幕表現着的文學之一種特殊的風味。</p>
<p>我很想關於表現技術方面有談到一些。開始時紳士型的主人公在矮屋子裏吃過鴉片烟之後，他神精錯亂的夢囈般的呌喊，用重攝的盡面表現他內心的苦痛。一直到敎堂的鐘聲饗了，他回復了知覺。這由於主角克拉德倫斯（ClaudeRains）的表演的努力和攝影的優秀，那鴉片烟館的空氣，自然是發揮了文學描寫電影的獨特技能。同樣的，在墓地的一塲，一個好烟糊塗的老頭兒，一個無理取鬧的野孩子，一個陰奸的紳士，三人懷着不同的心情，在那冷靜的深夜中，懾服了人們的呼吸。又如狂風暴雨之夜，導演寫街燈，寫小孩兒的合唱，寫天象的變化，寫雷雨的漸次來臨，一直到折樹破窗，這這裏人們不能直接看見主人公殺害姪兒的經過，可是這給與人們深切的印象，使以後發現了兇手，那一次暴風狂雨便給與人們深切的回味。</p>
<p>從各方面來說，無論是音樂效果，攝影，表演，以及於怖景，都是高度的藝術表現。特別是主角，他在這裏雖然戲並不多，然而他是保持了「法網情絲」中同樣成績的，的確，我們對於這新由舞台上轉來的克拉穩倫斯的演技，十分注意。「法網情絲」中他是一個萬惡的訟師，「戰地離魂」中是一個忠厚的文人，現在是熟情而毒辣的聖徒，他都有着恰到好處的表演。他的好處，不僅是能擔任多方面的角色，主要的他在任何塲合不放鬆人性的揣摩。假使說他沒有很長的演戲經騐的話，那末他能如此沉着，達到如此爐火純靑的程度，那眞是天才的表現了。</p>
<p>其他諸人，如陶勒斯蒙特高茂萊（DouglasMontgomery）在「悽紅慘綠」中就有過很好的成績，在這裏他賒了靑年之外還扮裝老人。又如女角漢蓁安琪爾（Heather　Anfel）之少女的天眞……都使人們感受着演技的滿足了。</p>
<h3>「無愁君子」公映</h3>
<p>流浪人的命運是悲苦的，可是在生活裏却有一顆向上的心，，雖然處處遭受了人們的輕蔑和訕笑，却並不因此便消沉下來。所以世界上永不曾缺少過此等人，而他們的笑料也就長遠的不曾一日間斷。</p>
<p>他們在凄苦的境遇裏，並沒想到會令人發笑，人們看見了他們也不知爲什麼嘴竟合攏下來。這笑，是隨了人心的不同，而有冷笑，熱笑，苦笑，狂笑之分，可是他們却並不因此改變了自己原有的姿態。</p>
<p>「無愁君子」所以超越其它的滑稽片，正因爲它具有深刻的意義，滿腔情緒，寄之於嘻笑怒之中，滑稽而外，悲意無盡。</p>
<p>除了韓劉兩君子外，介紹了一位新人——梅琳小姐，是値得電影觀衆注意的。</p>
<p>這個片子，已定於星期五起在金城大戲院公映了。</p>
<h3>聯華消息數則</h3>
<p>「國風」片中有一幕新生活運動。鄭君里大演其說，因爲他說的是廣東話，所以一向以爲他是上海人的同事，今天纔知道他是廣東人。</p>
<p>「無愁君子」韓蘭根掃墓歸來，劃繼羣問他說：「老韓你回來了？」老韓說：「回來了，祖先幷沒有把我留下！」</p>
<p>拍「寒江落雁」時，陳燕燕穿着明艷動人的結婚禮服，黎灼灼故意的問他說：「燕，你是同誰結婚？燕燕幷不加思索的說：「同羅朋！」等衆人聞聲笑時，她纔覺得自己是被灼灼騙了。</p>
<p>尙冠武並不會吹笛，黎鏗對於笛是更不會吹，可是在「天倫」裏尙冠武曾教黎鏗學笛、，而黎鏗還是吹得挺好。</p>
<p>孫瑜素常不大喜歡說話，近些天因爲他寫「可敬的克萊登」劇本，差不多每天對同人只有一句話好說了，這句話就是在下班之後他所說的「明天見」。</p>

<h3>雲天恨塞（Living　on　Velvet）（五）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>當他們結婚的那天，脫雷還對着愛梅道：「這件事不妥當。你將來一定要後悔的。我不算什麼。我是毫無價値的人。我輕視人類……我想人類都是殘酷，愚笨，兇惡的。我亦沒有朋友，因爲我不願意有朋友。我痛恨世界，而世界對於我亦沒有一些的愛。我的生命在五年以前已經吿終的了。我過的是非人的生活，將來亦會帶累到你的。你嫁我之後，將沒有一刻安定的時候……沒有一天的滿足……」</p>
<p>脱雷說話的時候，是很鄭重其事的，但愛梅聽的時候，却嬉開了一張嘴，好像他的話有無窮的滋味似的。等到他說完了，她歎著一口氣道：「你說的話多麼奇妙呀！」</p>
<p>在他們結婚之後，愛梅和脫雷就講到家庭的財政問題了。大部份的話，都是愛梅一個人說的。脫雷茫然的聽著，好似不關心似的。他旣沒有工作，亦沒有餘欵，將來如何，亦正屬渺茫。他所知道的，就是鍾愛愛梅。他所喜歡的，就是他和愛梅現在居然成爲夫婦了。至於明天的事，當然不是脫雷派克所顧慮得到的。華德倒是一位至情的朋友。他在長島的鄕下，有一所小房子，他就讓給他們住了。他們所付的房金，可算是等於零。在脫雷無法尋找工作的時候，這個帮助却是很用得著的。</p>
<p>脫雷在長島的鄉間住下來之後，每天早晨魷同著其他的鄕居者，一同到紐約去。有的時候，他要到晚上九點鐘才回來。但是無論如何，他仍舊找不到事情做。愛梅的姑母瑪莎很替他担心。他想仍舊將她的零用錢給她，但她婉謝了。他的嫁給脫雷，是不管好壞的，並且她旣深愛著脫雷，她就應當跟著他吃苦，一時的窮困，是不足過　的。她所希望的，就是脫脫能够稍爲隨俗些，待人接物方面，能够稍爲柔順些。</p>
<p>她一次一次的，自己吿訴自己，他慢慢會改變的。她希望將來有一天，她的愛，他的諒解能够將這個不近人情的人，從愁雲慘霧之中，拉了出來。但久而久之她自己漸漸覺悟了自己的錯誤。脫雷已是不可救藥的人了。他自己亦不願意更改。華德過了幾天，就來看看他們。他看着愛梅一天一天的受着憂愁的煎熬，口角旁邊已經起了縐紋，他不覺爲之　然心酸。</p>
<p>最後，華德想到了一個帮助她的方法，而不使她知道。他知道脫雷手裏，還有許多一錢不値的股票。華德在紐約交易所裏，是很有些勢力的。他給脫雷打了一個電報，說他的股票忽然價格飛漲了。這樣，脫雷就將股票全部脫手，賣了一萬塊錢。這下子一來，愛梅和脫雷果然就喜出望外了。</p>
<p>到了明天，愛梅就跑到紐約，去採辦東西——她久已渴想的東西……一些新式的傢俱，柔軟的地毯，和顏色的窗窓等等，好使脫雷的家庭，成個家庭的樣子。她在紐約採辦什物的兩天，就是她很久很久之中，最快活的兩天了。兩天完結，她己是精疲力渴的回到家裏。不想她到家的時候，她　了一跳。那裏有許多工人，在後院忙亂著作工，脫雷在一旁監視　。（未完）</p>

<h3>Draft of the Habeas Corpus Law Completed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan previously assigned five members, including Shi Shangkuan, to draft the Habeas Corpus Law. After five meetings, the initial draft, consisting of ten articles, has been completed and submitted to the Criminal Law Committee. A meeting is scheduled for the 25th to review it. After the review, it will be submitted to the Yuan meeting. This law is based on Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution and Article 9 of the draft constitution, so that people arrested by non-judicial organs can request relief from judicial organs in accordance with this law. (24th Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Re-examine the Transaction Tax Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the amendment to the transaction tax rate, the Legislative Yuan's meeting last week resolved to return it to the Finance and Economics Committees for re-examination. The two committees held a joint meeting at 2 PM on the 24th to re-examine the case. Chen Changheng chaired the meeting. As a result of the review, the relevant articles of the regulations have been revised in accordance with the principles of the Central Political Council's decision to amend the transaction tax rate, and the wording has also been reorganized. It will be submitted to this week's Yuan meeting for deliberation. According to the original nine articles of the transaction tax regulations for exchanges, Article 2 stipulates the transaction tax rates for six items: securities, bid money, cotton, cotton yarn, flour, and miscellaneous grains. The current revision mainly involves adding a provision in the securities section that exempts government bond transactions within marketable securities from taxation. In the bid money section, the original tax rate of seven li per bar of national currency is changed to eight fen. Other articles unrelated to the tax rate amendment remain unchanged.

<h3>Foreign Ministry Cables Jiang Zuobin to Expedite the Sino-Siamese Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Siamese government's crackdown on overseas Chinese and imposition of oppression have been repeatedly petitioned by overseas Chinese groups to the central government, urging the Siamese government to abolish illegal and harsh laws as soon as possible, and requesting a clear order to ban Siamese rice imports to show resistance. After discussion, the central government decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should instruct Minister Jiang in Japan to quickly negotiate with the Siamese Minister in Japan to establish a Sino-Siamese treaty and establish formal diplomatic relations, so as to fundamentally relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese in Siam.

<h3>The Necessity of Plant Disease Inspection</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The abundance or scarcity of agricultural harvests, apart from weather and human factors, is most significantly affected by pests and diseases. Our country is known as an agricultural nation, but in general, little attention is paid to the prevention and control of pests and diseases. As a result, the estimated annual losses are over 400 million yuan, which is another important problem besides floods and droughts.</p>
<p>Many people know about domestic problems, such as locusts and mulberry silkworms. However, the import of foreign plants has continued to increase in recent years, with free sales and no restrictions. These foreign plants often have their own special pests and diseases. Once the environment changes, they are more likely to breed and spread, and the damage is even greater than in their place of origin. Today, more than one type of plant pest has been introduced into our country from foreign countries, and the damage is already known. There are red bollworms, cotton mealybugs, wheat smut, etc. These types of pests have recently become quite widespread, greatly affecting harvests. Other germs that have not been imported but have the possibility of being imported are also worrying. If prevention is not strengthened, the damage to our country's agricultural products will inevitably be even greater.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the import of foreign plant pests and diseases, all countries strictly implement inspection policies, creating what is called inspection barriers, especially the United States and Japan are the strictest. Relying on scientific methods, imported plants are inspected. Once it is discovered that there is a risk of transmitting pests and diseases, their entry is prohibited. In the past, our country's exported plants had never been inspected in advance. After export, they were often regarded as dangerous by foreign countries. The light ones were ordered to be returned to the place of origin, and the heavy ones were completely burned. Some even used this as an excuse to permanently prohibit their import. Agricultural products have always been the main part of our country's exports. The sluggishness of foreign trade in recent years is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The inspection barriers of various countries were originally intended to prevent pests and diseases, but their intention also included restricting the import of foreign goods. In recent years, economic panic has spread to various countries. To seek self-reliance, it is necessary to adopt a self-defense economic policy and seek to block the intrusion of foreign goods. However, there are often treaty restrictions between various countries, which are inconvenient to act willfully. Therefore, the name of inspection is used to carry out the reality of prohibiting imports. For our country, it is especially easy to find excuses because our country's exported plants have never been inspected.</p>
<p>If our country wants to prevent the import of foreign pests and diseases, and at the same time, safeguard the credibility of our country's exported plants, it is necessary to establish an inspection policy. By inspecting exported plants ourselves first, we can prevent foreigners from restricting their import. By conducting a strict inspection of imported plants, pests and diseases can be prevented from spreading into our country. This is a win-win situation. The "Regulations on Plant Pest Inspection" of the Ministry of Industry have been implemented first in Shanghai. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau began to implement it on the 20th of this month. This matter is directly sufficient to eliminate the inherent pests and diseases of our country and prevent the import of foreign pests and diseases. Indirectly, it can help the export of domestic agricultural products to restore the status of foreign trade. Its intention is very good, and it is also something that the people of the country should support.</p>
<h3>US Navy Completes Pacific Grand Maneuvers Plan; Over a Hundred Warships to Set Sail Next Monday; Congress to Halve Number of New Ships to be Added</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Navy today completed its largest peacetime maneuvers plan in history. The pro-Navy faction in Congress is also making every effort to pass the largest peacetime naval budget. The House Appropriations Committee has passed the 1936 naval appropriations bill, totaling US$465,289,261, ready for discussion by the full Congress. This budget is an increase of US$174,879,098 compared to last year. The detailed plan of the naval maneuvers is highly confidential and scheduled to begin next Monday. At that time, 135 warships will set sail from San Diego and Saint Peter's district. Rear Admiral Johnson, commander of the air force in charge of defense, has today boarded the warship USS Chester and sailed to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the "defense" plan of the Hawaiian Islands in order to cope with "attacks" from both air and sea. Observers believe it is very important that the maneuvers and budget are proceeding at the same time. The passage of the budget by the Appropriations Committee shows that President Roosevelt also supports expanding military spending. Although military spending has increased, the Appropriations Committee has also halved the Navy Department's large-scale shipbuilding plan from 24 ships. Therefore, the approved amount is US$28 million less than Secretary of the Navy Swanson's original proposal. After the bill was passed by the committee, the House of Representatives immediately began to study it, with the debate beginning with Democratic Representative Vinson, chairman of the Naval Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr. Vinson argued that the US Navy should not be weaker than any country in the world. He believed that at a time when the clouds of war were spreading in Europe and disturbances were rampant around the world, the safety of the United States depended entirely on its navy reaching the extent permitted by treaty. He believed that if the United States had spent a few million dollars more on naval expenditure in 1914, it would not have been involved in the European war, and the United States would not have wasted countless money and lost countless lives. The bill includes points for improving naval ports and increasing military quotas. The increase in officers is 2,677, and the increase in soldiers is 82,500. In addition, there are 555 additional aircraft and 51 additional Marine Corps officers, etc. The committee cut the original shipbuilding plan in half, saying that when the naval limitation treaty completely expires, funds can still be allocated to build new ships on a temporary basis. The committee also issued a brief statement to appease the peace faction in Congress, saying that this plan was not designed because of the danger of war. The reason why this year's budget is so large is because the United States wanted to prevent the expansion of the world's navies last year, so it took the lead in building less. Now that the next naval conference is scheduled to be held this year, the committee has reduced the construction plan by half. In this way, the spirit of the United States' adherence to arms limitation can also be shown to the world. (National Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Standley, Chief of Naval Operations, told the Appropriations Committee today that, according to the opinions of senior US Navy personnel, the current US Navy is unable to wage a war of aggression against another world power, but it is capable of repelling attacks on the US coast. If the United States had the naval strength permitted by treaty, its navy could be as strong as any other country. (Reuters Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Washington, US Undersecretary of the Navy Roosevelt recently reported to the House of Representatives that the US Navy currently has 360 ships and 760 aircraft. However, starting from July this year, 15 destroyers will be added, and the number of aircraft will be increased to 920. (United Press Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<h3>US Army to Enlist Over 70,000 More Men; First Step in Expanding the Army</h3>
<p>(Washington) The War Department announced today that, starting from July 1st, the US Army will recruit 71,700 new soldiers, with those between the ages of 18 and 35 being qualified. This is the first step in expanding the army's strength to 165,000 men, as permitted by Congress (Reuters Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Prepares Third Supplementary Plan; Expanding Main Battleship Strength</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The US government has recently been actively carrying out a shipbuilding plan to increase its main battleship strength. In view of this fact, the Japanese naval authorities plan to implement a third supplementary plan to expand its main battleship strength after the second supplementary plan is completed (United Press Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the US House Appropriations Committee has reduced the initial budget for the construction of 24 warships in the Vinson Act by half. The Japanese Navy's opinion on this is as follows: "We have not received an official telegram and do not know the details of the reduction. However, Chief of Naval Operations Standley stated in the committee that if the naval power is further strengthened, the attacking power of foreign countries will increase. Therefore, the United States does not actually need to expand its naval strength. Therefore, it is natural that the shipbuilding budget has been reduced by half. There are many people in the United States who hope for arms reduction. It would be good if this could be reflected. Also, if various countries unconditionally recognize Japan's claims, military spending can be reduced." (Dentsu Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Meets Hirota Again</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ariyoshi, the Japanese envoy to China who arrived in Tokyo on the 23rd, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:50 am on the 24th. At that time, the regular meeting of the senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was being held. He reported to Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the Bureau of Commerce Kuru, and Director of the Bureau of Europe and Asia Togo on the political and economic situation in China, the possibility of Sino-Japanese cooperation, etc. The meeting lasted about an hour. The content was the same as what was reported to Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday. In the afternoon of the 24th, Envoy Ariyoshi again discussed concrete measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation with Foreign Minister Hirota in the Minister's office. It seems that they agreed on the attitude of trusting the Chinese side towards Japan, that Sino-Japanese cooperation should not be limited to the economic field, but should be extended to the cultural and political fields. (Dentsu Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in view of the concrete improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, has become more convinced of the policy of good neighborliness towards China. Therefore, he will take the promotion of the embassy in China to an embassy as the first step, and then seek concrete solutions. The timing of the promotion of the embassy to an embassy will be surprisingly early, perhaps between July and August. Envoy Ariyoshi will still be invited to take the post of the first ambassador. Taking this as an opportunity, for the sake of trade settlement and currency control, he will consider establishing a credit system and other economic cooperation. If China officially sends a special envoy, Foreign Minister Hirota will personally discuss all political issues with the leaders of the National Government. Therefore, the future development of Sino-Japanese relations is extremely noteworthy. (Dentsu Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Preparations for Sino-US Aviation</h3>
<p>Alameda, California: The Oriental Flying boat flew safely back here from Hawaii today. Officials at United Air Lines predict that a full Sino-US air route can be opened soon. The round trip covered 2,400 miles. Although headwinds greatly reduced the speed, it took less than 22 hours. After hearing that the plane had returned safely, the airline issued a congratulatory telegram, saying that the round trip to Honolulu was a strong reason for us to open a full Sino-US air mail route as soon as possible. We congratulate you on your great success. (National News Agency Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Alameda: Pan American Airlines' 20-ton clipper No. 5, which flew to Hawaii from here last Wednesday, flew out of Honolulu yesterday and returned here today, carrying a total of six people. The distance was 2,100 miles and the flight time was 20 hours and 59 minutes, which was 3 hours and 13 minutes longer than the time to fly from here to Hawaii. (Reuters Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Government Leader stated today that Congress will pass a large sum of money to develop Pacific air mail transport after the Post Office Department has completed its inspection of the new routes. House Joint Committee Chairman Arnold said that the postal authorities have plenty of time to complete a detailed investigation before the end of this session of Congress. As soon as the investigation is completed, Congress can include the funds for this matter in the supplementary budget. Congress recently rejected a proposal to allocate US$2 million to build aviation bases on Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, on the grounds that the post office had not studied the matter and therefore could not submit it to Congress for discussion.

<h3>US Raises Silver Price Again</h3>

Well-informed sources predict that if the price of silver is raised, the new price will be between 75 cents and 85 cents per ounce. According to President Roosevelt's order in December 1933, the price of domestically mined silver was set at 64.5 cents per ounce. However, at the beginning of this month, President Roosevelt issued another decree, reducing the government's minting fee from 50 percent to 40 percent, thereby raising the price of silver to 71.11 cents per ounce. (National Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) A newspaper reporter asked the Treasury Department today whether the government would increase the price of domestically mined silver again due to the sharp rise in silver prices in foreign markets. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau replied that the people should not gamble on what the government is doing, and the Treasury Department will act at any time. An official from the Treasury Department only said that the Treasury Department is watching the situation very closely, but does not want to have any comment. (Reuters Telegram of the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) A leading gold and silver merchant told a Reuters reporter today that speculators are currently pushing up world silver prices, hoping to equalize them with domestic prices in the United States, and then put pressure on the United States to raise silver prices again. It is still unknown when this race will end, but someone will eventually be caught in the trap. Many people here believe that Senator Adams' statement that the price of silver will eventually reach US$1 per ounce is true. However, it is estimated that many parties hold more than 100 million ounces, which can be cashed in at any time, so the silver market is vulnerable to attacks. However, some people also say that the United States still needs to purchase silver worth 400 million pounds before it can establish its gold and silver ratio. (Reuters Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau declared in the Senate Finance Committee today that any bonus plan must increase expenditures and must levy new taxes to raise funds. If a bonus bill is passed by a majority, the Treasury Department will recommend a new inheritance tax to raise US$200 million to US$600 million annually. The Secretary of the Treasury also said that the Treasury Department's financial plan is based on President Roosevelt's budget. The credit of the United States depends on strict compliance with this budget. If new expenditures exceed the budget, government bonds will be greatly affected. At this point, the Treasury Department's financial plan will be disrupted and the nation's recovery will be delayed. The Finance Committee asked whether this warning applies to the compromise bill proposed by Senator Harrison, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Morgenthau replied yes. The Finance Committee was quite shocked to hear this, as they expected Harrison's proposal to be accepted by President Roosevelt. At the same time, a spokesman for the American Legion stated that Harrison's proposal was not accepted by the American Legion, and veterans still demanded that they be paid all cash according to the provisions of the Wilson Act.

The Bolivian government announced that the Bolivian army repelled the Paraguayan army to outside the Parapiti River and has broken through the Paraguayan line. The Paraguayan government still claims that, on the whole line, the Paraguayan army is still victorious. However, it also admits that due to the Bolivian army concentrating over 80,000 troops on the central front line, the Paraguayan army has retreated automatically in some areas.

<h3>Soviet Russia Concedes; Turning Point in Franco-Soviet Negotiations; Agreement Said to be Initialed by the End of the Week</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to reports, the Franco-Soviet treaty negotiations have turned around during Easter, so it can be initialed within a few days. They no longer oppose the point that military mutual assistance cannot be automatically implemented and that the Soviet Union promises not to promote communism in France and its territories. Le Matin predicts that the agreement will be initialed by French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin by the end of this week. (National News Agency Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, difficulties had previously arisen due to the Soviet Union's insistence on mechanical application. This has now been largely eliminated. Le Matin reports that the final text of the pact will be initialed by French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin by the end of this week. Le Figaro said that it is reasonable for the compilation of the terms to take time in order to ensure they are proper. This agreement should be based on the principles of rationality and appropriateness. This has not changed in the French side's opinion. Le Journal said that the French government is still firmly maintaining its position, which has been understood by the Soviet government. The Soviet Union will eventually accept the methods that France is satisfied with. Le Populaire believes that this agreement can be signed imminently. Le Petit Journal raised the issue of Soviet debt, hoping that it will be seriously considered, saying, "When British Lord Privy Seal Eden visited Russia earlier, he reached an agreement in principle with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is willing to discuss the debt issue with Britain. The main point is to repay one-tenth of the total debt, divided into twenty years, with no interest." (Havas of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The press here believes that Litvinov's return to Moscow instead of coming to Paris indicates that the Franco-Soviet agreement has not yet been finalized.

L'Echo de Paris said that the French government will withdraw its final supplement. L'Intransigeant takes an optimistic view of the current situation, saying, "France will be able to make concessions. Once this agreement is approved by Paris, it will be signed in Moscow by Mr. Laval." All newspapers related to the government claim that Litvinov's quick return to Moscow cannot show that the progress of the Franco-Soviet agreement has made any compromises on any side.

<p>(Berlin) Important political figures must gather in Munich this afternoon to discuss the League of Nations' resolution condemning Germany's rearmament. But the actions of these people are very suspicious. According to the authorities, only Hitler and the head of the Nazi Party's intelligence department, Dietrich, will go to Munich, but purely for private matters. Foreign Minister Neurath and Special Envoy for Disarmament General Ribbentrop will also go to Munich to participate in the discussion, but both of them are still in Berlin today. People are now speculating about the second step of Germany's foreign policy. It is now believed that Hitler has used part of the Easter holidays to closely study the overall situation. A cabinet meeting will be convened in the coming days, followed by an announcement. (Reuters Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official political and diplomatic news agency issued a statement saying, "Germany's protest against the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council on April 17 has no important political significance. It is only a suitable step to promote understanding of the current issues. The German note is only a protest against the methods used in Geneva. In short, if other countries are unwilling to admit their mistakes, the Geneva resolution has no value whatsoever." (Havas Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Naval Negotiations to Continue Next Month in London</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of Germany's naval rearmament, recent negotiations between British and German experts were held in Geneva.

However, the scope of the talks is strictly limited to technical aspects, such as the types and tonnage of warships, and the caliber of guns on board. When the experts dispatched by Berlin come to London to participate in the talks, their instructions will be limited to those received by the ambassador to Britain. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) British figures have recently begun to express concern about Germany's naval armament. The "Morning Post" published an editorial recalling the demands made by Chancellor Hitler in his Berlin speech, namely that the German navy should be 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy. The editorial stated that if this demand were granted, it would be tantamount to allowing the German navy to possess an offensive force comparable to that of Britain. The newspaper expressed unease about the future talks between the British and German navies, saying that it would be extremely dangerous for Britain to accept a ratio constraint. Conversely, the British navy must regain its freedom, be free from any restrictions, and undergo thorough reform. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) There has been a tradition of exchanging army officers between Britain and Germany for practical training, but it has not been followed for several years. It has now been restored.

<h3>Polish New Constitution Takes Effect, President Signs and Promulgates</h3>
<p>Warsaw The new constitution passed by the Polish Parliament on March 23 was solemnly signed by the President of the Polish Republic in front of all cabinet members tonight and took effect immediately. The first phase of constitutional reform, which has been the focus of public debate for the past few years and has led to the establishment of Poland's current dictatorial government, has now come to an end. The second phase will be the reform of the electoral system, which may be passed by a special session of the Parliament next month. This new election law aims to abolish the party system and replace it with corporatism. In the future, candidates for parliament will no longer be nominated by political parties, but will be designated by special election committees in each electoral district. These committees will be composed of representatives of local administrative organs and public institutions such as the National Bank and City Savings Bank. The election committees can only designate candidates that can be approved by the government, so the new law has effectively eliminated the opposition parties. The bill is also a major blow to the ethnic minorities in Poland, as they may no longer have a foothold in the Polish Parliament in the future. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>(Paris) The "Morning Post" received news from its London correspondent that rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle are rife again. The most widely rumored foreign reports are that Prime Minister MacDonald will be swapped with Lord Privy Seal Baldwin, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain is a candidate for Prime Minister. However, apart from Chamberlain, no other candidate has been put forward. The newspaper also said, "These rumors are clearly related to the upcoming election campaign and should not be taken too seriously. However, what we should pay attention to is that people in British political circles believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently shown signs of setting himself apart, which is quite unexpected. Previously, when Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Streychay, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had already made such a display." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Pro-German Sentiment</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Hungarian House of Representatives was re-elected on the 12th of this month. As a result, the government party, the National Unity Party, won a great victory, gaining 168 seats out of 245, accounting for 70% of the total. The "Paris Echo" recently published an article by renowned journalist Beattie, discussing the international impact of this election, saying that the parliamentarians will definitely tend towards a system similar to the German National Socialist Party. It said, "The program of the current Prime Minister Gömbös is none other than the mob politics of the National Socialist Party. In other words, it is to divide up large estates, overthrow treaties, end cooperation with Italy, and restore the alliance with Germany. Therefore, it is to be expected that Italy's policy of tending towards a mutual assistance system will become increasingly advanced and estranged from Hungary." (Havas, 24th)</p>

Dr. Mei and his party have now departed for Berlin on Tuesday, and from Berlin they will travel to Paris, Zurich, Geneva, Vienna, London, and Rome, to travel in a private capacity. Before departing from here, a reporter from the Havas news agency interviewed him. Dr. Mei made a statement, roughly saying that Chinese opera is noisy with gongs and drums, and is most suitable for performance in front of a large crowd, while modern Western theaters are quiet and solemn, and are only sufficient for a small number of people to watch. He plans to adopt a compromise between the two, in order to improve Chinese opera and achieve the effect of being appreciated by both the refined and the popular. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) When Dr. Mei Lanfang left here for Europe, he made the following remarks: "As I bid farewell to your country, I have warm gratitude to you, your government, and all sectors of society, as I was very happy during my time in the Soviet Union. At the same time, I am deeply moved by the friendly attention I received in your country, and by the meetings with key figures from all walks of life in your country, as they were truly able to understand and appreciate our art, which seems formally distant. I offer my heartfelt thanks, please accept them." (Tass, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan believes that the Biography of Qing Dynasty Figures relates to national history and culture.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Bans Import of Sodium Chloride</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that foreign edible salt is subject to import restrictions according to import tariffs, and "sodium chloride" is also included in the ban. However, it is needed for scientific experiments and medical treatment. Therefore, it has been stipulated that the quantity of this cargo reported for import must not exceed two dan. If it is indeed for medical use, it will be allowed to be imported. The Ministry of Finance is also worried that general unscrupulous merchants will import "sodium chloride" in large quantities, falsely claiming it as edible salt or using it for other salt production purposes. In order to prevent it carefully, it has formulated nine articles of "Sodium Chloride" control measures with reference to the method of auditing Chilean nitrate. In the future, those who import or re-export must first report to the salt affairs agency of each province for handling in accordance with the law to show restriction. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Recent New Facilities for Commercial Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Shangdong, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, recently talked about the details of the new facilities for commercial inspection in our country as follows. The Ministry is currently planning to carry out three new inspections, all of which are export commodities: one is hair, the second is hair products, and the third is camel hair grading inspection. Since the abolition of the Guangdong Commercial Inspection Bureau recently, it is regrettable that hair face powder, etc., shipped abroad from Guangdong, may be difficult to export due to lack of inspection. This commodity inspection policy is a new facility in our country. It has only been implemented for a short time and is difficult to be perfect. People from all walks of life, especially Chinese and foreign merchants who have a direct relationship, are welcome to express their opinions at any time. The Commodity Inspection Law newly passed by the Legislative Yuan has been scheduled to be implemented on July 1, and a fee schedule has been separately formulated to reduce the burden on merchants. The inspection fees collected are due to the government's financial difficulties and only a very small fee is taken to subsidize the required materials and procedures. There is often a misunderstanding outside that the inspection fee collection has a tax-like nature. Furthermore, the various inspections of the Commercial Inspection Bureau are mainly for import and export goods. The scope of inspection is limited to the location of the inspection bureau. The cotton adulteration management office is responsible for cotton inspection in the inland areas. Its work can be an auxiliary to the inspection bureau and is not repeated. Since the cotton inspection began in 1918, the original moisture content exceeded 20%, but it has now gradually decreased to 12%. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Shangdong, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, said that the Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau was established in June 1919, but until 1920, the bureau submitted very few documents to the Ministry. After the Southwest Political Committee decided to abolish it this month, the Ministry telegraphed to inquire about the matter. According to the reply, the inspection was stopped on the 11th. The bureau may not be able to fully comply with the rules set by the Ministry in the performance of its duties, causing merchants to criticize and point out. However, if goods such as hair face powder, which are required to be inspected abroad, are not inspected, it is feared that it will be difficult to export these goods in the future. In the future, the inspection policy will be improved at any time, and it is hoped that all sectors will express their opinions as a reference for improvement. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London gold price today (24th) is 143 shillings, 8.5 pence, up 2.5 pence.</p>
<p>London Silver Bars: After the silver market opened yesterday, prices fell by 0.25 due to a large amount of profit-taking. However, the silver market this morning showed a firm trend again. The spot price was 32.8125 pence, and the futures price was 32.9375 pence, both up 0.4375. In the forenoon, China made large purchases, and speculators both bought and sold. It is rumored that speculators want to raise the price of silver to reach the domestic price in the United States. However, there has been a lot of buying, so the silver market is vulnerable to profit-taking.</p>
<p>Mount Lyell Silver: The market today sympathizes with London, and prices continue to rise, with near-term contracts up about 40 pounds, and long-term contracts up about 80 pounds.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>US-British: The London foreign exchange market traded well today. The opening exchange rate between the US and Britain was $4.84875, the same as yesterday's closing price. The trend of the dollar remained firm today. The price at 2:00 PM was $4.835, down 1.375 from the opening.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening price was 73.56 francs, up two pounds. Later, the price of the franc became stronger due to the sale of pounds sterling by Europe. Therefore, the franc was quite firm one hour after the opening. However, it eased slightly at 2:00 PM, when the exchange rate was 73.31 francs, down 20 pounds from this morning's opening.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton: Prices fell at the opening today due to profit-taking. It is expected that price fluctuations will depend on the development of the silver situation. In the first hour after the opening, cotton prices fell again due to a lack of excitement. However, overall, the cotton market is still stable. It is reported that the profit-taking of the May contract is gradually coming to an end, and there is rain in the west.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: A grain company in Chicago is rumored to be in trouble, so the wheat and miscellaneous grain markets have been delayed in opening.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: Prices fell today. The July contract price at 1:00 PM was 5 shillings and 7.5 pence, down 0.875.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: The market continued to show a stable trend. The July contract price at 1:00 PM was 6.37, up one pound.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The market was quiet this morning. The July and September contract prices at noon were 5.8125 pence, down 0.06825 from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>New York: Market prices continued to fall today due to a lack of buyers, and there was no exciting news from other markets. Trading was very light, but sentiment remained stable.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Although the market expects increased profit-taking and labor unrest will limit buying, the opening was still firm. Most stocks rose, especially railroad stocks. Steel stocks lagged behind. The New York stock market prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Headquarters, becoming an independent agency. This was approved by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and Chen Jitang was appointed concurrently as Naval Commander-in-Chief, with Jiang Xiyuan and Zhang Zhiying as Naval Headquarters Vice Commanders. After receiving the order, Chen took office at the First Army Group Headquarters on the 18th of this month. After the ceremony, Chen addressed the officers of the two fleet headquarters, stating that the coastline of Guangdong Province is very long, and to consolidate coastal defense, it is necessary to train a strong navy. Previously, the province's navy was divided into coastal defense and river defense departments, which hindered reorganization and command. In order to unify command and promote solidarity, the government approved the merger of the two fleet headquarters and reorganized them into the Naval Headquarters, so that one agency can manage affairs and facilitate reorganization. He hopes that the officers of the two departments will work together and continue to serve as before. After the speech, Vice Commanders Zhang Zhiying and Jiang Xiyuan successively delivered speeches before the meeting adjourned. (April 19th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Report</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>From Qian County to Chang'an</p>
<p>Qian County is located on a plateau with little water conservancy. Cultivation depends solely on rain and snow. Digging wells and springs requires a depth of about 60 fathoms north of the city, 40 fathoms in the city center, and 30-40 fathoms in the eastern part, where the terrain gradually descends, and well water can be used for irrigation. The Construction Bureau sent personnel with equipment to drill artesian wells, but after three or four attempts, no water was found. The county's population initially numbered over 200,000, but the great drought of 1929 caused the majority to flee or die. Recently, the county government organized baojia and investigated the population. After five years of reproduction since the disaster, the total population is only over 150,000. Last summer's heavy rain brought abundant harvests for the year, enough to feed the people for three years. This spring's snow also foreshadows a bountiful harvest. The city and countryside are united in joy, presenting a promising outlook. However, the locals have a saying that there is a major drought every thirty years and a minor drought every ten years. It is urgent to prepare for disaster prevention. The Construction Bureau's failed well-drilling should not be abandoned midway.</p>
<p>According to County Magistrate Pan Jian's account of the current political situation in Qian County: (1) Strict enforcement of opium prohibition. The opium prohibition measures in Shaanxi Province are being carried out in stages by district. The first phase involves 42 counties with absolute prohibition, which is now being strictly enforced. Qian County is one of them. Fortunately, it is not an opium-producing area, and after the years of famine, farmers have not forgotten the old wounds and are mostly planting food crops. Very few people are planting opium, so the prohibition order can be implemented immediately. As for the existing opium dens, numbering over 70, they are classified into four grades, and opium suppression donations are collected to fund the opium suppression bureau, so as to gradually promote opium suppression. (2) Expansion of rural primary schools. The county government and local gentry raised funds of 17,000 to 18,000 yuan to expand rural primary schools as much as possible, so that out-of-school children of school age can have the opportunity to enroll. At the same time, the movement to cut men's queues and liberate women's feet can also be promoted through education, indirectly achieving results. (3) Fundraising to establish a commoners' factory. Machines have been purchased and recruitment and training are underway. It is planned to use local cotton and wool to manufacture daily necessities made of cotton and wool textiles, gradually extending to other small industrial products, in order to resist foreign goods and cultivate the rural economy. In addition, the biggest shortage in the county is fuel. Coal sells for over two yuan per hundred pounds, charcoal is as expensive as eight yuan, and timber also needs to be purchased from both banks of the Wei River. There is currently no remedy for this. After the reporter left the county government, he went to Zhongshan Park, which had a couplet that read, "Preserve the gardens for a thousand years, let the elders enjoy them in all seasons." There are many open spaces in the park, with only a Sun Yat-sen memorial tower built. There is no other garden scenery. However, in the Huaiyin Hall next door, two giant locust trees are planted in the courtyard, with old trunks and hollow centers, which still feel ancient and elegant. Liang Mountain north of the city has the tombs of Emperor Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu.</p>
<p>The car entered Qian County's north gate and exited the east gate. The terrain slopes downwards, with a view of the plains. The climate is gradually warming, the wheat fields are turning green, and well pivots and pulleys stand facing each other from afar, like scattered soldiers in the wilderness. The sound of the car vibrates, and wild rabbits occasionally flee in fright. After forty li, we arrived at Liquan. The city walls are wide, but mostly dilapidated. The newly repaired city tower is solidly built of bricks. We saw soldiers guarding the east city, gathered in groups of three or five, basking in the sun against the wall. The uniforms were uneven, and discipline seemed ordinary. The spring cold was still biting, and residents were wearing five or six layers of heavy clothing, but they all had their waists bound and chests bared, and their buttons were not fastened. It seemed to be a habit. Wujiang Mountain, 18 li northeast of the city, has the Jian Mausoleum of Emperor Suzong of Tang, where Guo Ziyi is buried.</p>
<p>After traveling thirty li to Dianzhang Post, the wheat ridges were lush green (with occasional poppies), lined with colored soil, making for a well-ordered and pleasing view. The land was flat and the villages were dense. Only because of the oblique rays of the morning sun, the villages on the left side of the road appeared clear and picturesque, while those on the right side appeared only as dark shadows, but could still be seen from afar, with the sounds of chickens and dogs audible. The scenery of "no houses where people walk" was no longer seen. After about thirty li, looking toward the right front, a silver stream meandered like a floating object in the sky, showing its head but not its tail. This was the Wei River. To the left front were ancient tombs, some as high as hills, others as raised as mounds. They were mostly burial sites of emperors and meritorious officials of the Zhou and Qin dynasties. A gentleman, a native of Guanzhong, pointed to the tombs as the mausoleums of Kings Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang, and the graves of Duke Tai and Duke Lu. Further north was Jiusha Mountain, and further right was the Zhaoling Mausoleum of Emperor Taizong of Tang and the tombs of more than one hundred meritorious officials buried with him. The passengers in the car exclaimed "good feng shui," and made foolish remarks about "whoever is buried with him will become prosperous," which filled the air and made people laugh.</p>
<p>After traveling about ten li, we arrived at Xianyang, the capital of the Qin Dynasty, located north of the Wei River, south of Jiuyou Mountain. The mountains and rivers are both yang (the south of the mountain is called yang, and the north of the river is also called yang), hence the name Xianyang. The car did not enter the city but detoured from the north wall to the east and south, to the banks of the Wei River. The Wei River originates in Gansu, flows eastward into the territory, and receives the Jing River on the left, converging into the Yellow River. Its basin is rich in agricultural products, yielding two harvests a year. "Wei River cotton" is especially famous in the world. The Wei River is the most important waterway in Shaanxi Province. It takes four to five days upstream from Xianyang to Tongguan and two to three days downstream. The goods transported are mainly cotton, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and hides. Few passengers travel by water. If the Longhai Railway can be extended here by the end of the year, making both water and land transportation convenient, commerce will surely become more prosperous. Zhou Mausoleum is located 15 li north of the city and can be reached by car. According to people at the Zhou Mausoleum construction site, since the promotion of national tomb sweeping, the number of visitors has been increasing day by day, because the Yellow Emperor's Bridge Mausoleum is far away in Yaoxian, making travel difficult. A mile or so to the east is a floating bridge over the river. In the shallow areas at both ends, wooden beams support the bridge, while in the deep water in the center of the river, wide boats are used to float the bridge. The top is covered with sand and soil, allowing slow travel as if walking on flat ground. The water is as turbid as the Yellow River, not as clear as the Jing River. After crossing the river, we reached Lixi. The residents are few, but the trees are lush and the fields are cultivated. The road continues westward along the river for another mile or so to a village called Henan Street. According to legend, King Wen built a boat to serve as a bridge here, which is the ancient crossing of Xianyang. The Qin capital was north of the Wei River, and the Xianyang Palace was south of the Wei River. Changleg Bridge was built to connect the two palaces. Today, there are no traces of it due to the passage of time, and the floating bridge has been moved to the east. Looking north, only the reflection of Xianyang City is in the river, evoking thoughts of ancient times.</p>
<p>Traveling east and crossing Li Bridge, the fields are fertile and there are many canals. There are no mountains in sight, and the field of vision extends far. After thirty li, the Big Goose Pagoda south of Chang'an City, towering into the clouds, can already be seen clearly. The former sites of Afang Palace, Shanglin Garden, Weiyang Palace, and Haojing are all between the road north and the Wei River, but they cannot be reached by eyesight. After another 20 li, we arrived in Chang'an (Western Capital). The city walls are high and solid, resembling Nanjing. There are countless graves outside the moat, occupying a large area. It is unknown whether they contain the bones of soldiers or are civil tombs. The highway follows the northwest corner of the city and enters the North Pass. The Western Capital Station of the Longhai Railway is built outside the pass. From Yaodian, the boundary between Shaanxi and Gansu, to here, the so-called West-Changgan Road is 430 Chinese li, but the actual measurement is 336 kilometers. After the reporter said goodbye to the PingSui Railway in Baotou, he traveled with camels and cars. Today, at the sight of the westward-extending train of the Longhai Railway, his spirits were greatly lifted.</p>
<h3>Major Embezzlement Case in Hubei Construction Department, Water Plant Director Steals and Sells Three Ships of Machinery</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun Personally Orders Dismissal, Custody, and Investigation. Hankou Correspondence: A major embezzlement case previously occurred in the Hubei Provincial Security Office, and a verdict has just been reached. Unexpectedly, a major embezzlement case has also occurred in the Construction Department, which is now sensationalizing Wuhan. After Li Fanyi, the Director of the Construction Department, resigned, the Central Government appointed Liu Shoupeng as his successor. Liu arrived at the department on the 5th of this month to take over. Wu Bingchen, the Director of the Wuchang Water Plant and the Wuchang Machine Plant, took advantage of the transition between the old and new directors, colluded with the plant's accountant, Gan Weijie, and stole machine parts and scrap iron from the machine plant, loading them onto three barges, which were transported from Wuchang to Hankou and sold to Shao Daxing's copper and iron factory in Special District One. The money and goods were exchanged. Nine large barrels of machine oil were also stolen and sold. Liu Shoupeng, the Director of the Construction Department, received a confidential report and sent personnel to investigate, which confirmed the facts. On the 20th, he detained the plant director, Wu Bingchen, and the accountant, Gan Weijie. He then summoned the buyer, Shao Daxing, to the department for questioning. Wu and the others, faced with conclusive evidence, confessed to their crimes. Liu went to the provincial government to ask Chairman Zhang Qun for instructions on how to handle the matter. Zhang personally ordered that Wu Bingchen and Gan Weijie be dismissed and placed in the custody of the Provincial Public Security Bureau pending investigation. Shao Daxing, the buyer who privately bought a large amount of stolen goods, was also detained by the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The position of director of the water plant and machine plant was filled by Lu Zhao, appointed by the Construction Department. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Expands Sugar Industry, Yiwu Jin District Sugar Factory Has Annual Surplus</h3>
<p>Quzhou Correspondence: Jinhua, Lanxi, Tangxi, Yiwu, Dongyang, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang have always been areas rich in sugarcane and sugar stalks. These plants contain a very rich sugar content and are excellent raw materials for sugar production. Last year, the Construction Department set up a Jin District Cooperative Sugar Factory in Yiwu, using scientific equipment to produce exquisite white sugar, red sugar, and green sugar. Its cost is lower than that of Fujian and Guangdong and can compete with imported goods. Since its opening, sales have been very smooth and business has been booming. Currently, the factory's products are divided into improved local sugar, machine-made brown sugar, white sugar, and rock sugar. The remaining sugar stalk dregs, which were previously used as fuel, are also being used to produce high-quality Chinese paper using chemical methods. It is estimated that the factory can produce 1,500 piculs of white sugar each year at 16 yuan per picul, 6,000 piculs of red sugar at 14 yuan per picul, another 2,000 piculs at 13 yuan per picul, 500 piculs of green sugar at 12 yuan per picul, another 200 piculs at 7 yuan per picul, and 500 piculs of waste molasses at 4 yuan per picul, for a total annual income of 143,400 yuan. Annual expenses are only 100,600 yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is an annual surplus of 36,800 yuan. In order to expand its business, the factory plans to establish close ties with the wholesale department of the China Cooperative Society, the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Society's goods production and sales agency, and the production and sales agencies of cooperative societies in various provinces and cities. At the same time, the factory will send experienced personnel to contact various sugar merchants to promote sales. Recently, the Construction Department, seeing the progress of the factory's business, realized that although the cost of foreign sugar is low, it is difficult for it to compete with domestic sugar in the province due to increased tariffs and transportation costs. It plans to further expand the Jin District Cooperative Sugar Factory in Yiwu, increasing the annual sugar production to 100,000 piculs, with a budget of 100,000 yuan. It also plans to establish larger-scale sugar factories in the Wen and Qu areas and invite merchants to undertake them. If necessary, it may be jointly operated by the government and merchants, so as to achieve success as soon as possible. (April 22nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Implements Group Weddings</h3>
<p>The county government has recently noted the benefits of the New Life Movement's group weddings in Shanghai. It proposed a New Life Movement district wedding plan at the last party-government talk, which was unanimously approved. It was decided to follow suit and hold group weddings twice a year on May 5th and October 10th, with the county magistrate and the standing committee member of the party branch serving as officiants. The wedding fee is 20 yuan. Application forms have been drafted and announced to all sectors for implementation. The county's first group wedding will be held on Double Ten Day.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Completion of Baojia in District One</h3>
<p>District One, where the county seat is located, should be nominating baojia heads in the second phase. However, the nominees believe that the responsibilities are heavy and the tasks are complex, and are unwilling to take responsibility. They are resigning from the township offices, especially in the city and suburbs. As a result, the third phase of household registration work, originally scheduled to end on the 25th of this month, has not been completed on schedule because, although the baojia heads are willing to assist, the township chiefs are working alone and the results are limited. Currently, Huayang Town, Lujiatun, Baiwo, Lita, and Hui three townships have completed the work. Although the household registrations have been completed in the other areas, the people regard the joint security pledge regulations as a daunting task and are reluctant to sign them. Statistics show that only 70% have been completed. Yesterday, Director Shu Sheyu convened a meeting of township chiefs to discuss the difficulties. Each point was explained in detail, and each township was given a deadline to complete the work immediately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Uncovers Two Drug Pill Factories</h3>
<p>Gu Songxun, a patrolman under the direct jurisdiction of the First Branch Office of the Public Security Bureau of this county, led police to search for a drug pill factory at No. 2 Fuan Lane, East Gate, at 8:00 PM on the 23rd. They seized a bag of red drug pills, totaling 34 pills, a drug pill manufacturing machine, two large pieces of drug pill raw material embryos, and numerous manufacturing tools. They also arrested the drug pill manufacturers Du Wenyu, Xu Houcheng, Wu Yulian, and Cao Fang, four men and women. They were all taken to the station together. Subsequently, Xu Chen was arrested, along with a bottle of morphine. That night, Patrolman Gu escorted them to the General Bureau for interrogation. In addition, Public Security Bureau Inspector Ge also seized 37 gray drug pills at No. 7 Xiexing Lane, Guangqin Road, the other day, and arrested Xu Chuqing. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Kaihe Township Beat Up District Chief</h3>
<p>The dredging of the Jiang River in District Four has now reached Shengdian Bridge. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than 500 villagers were working on the dredging when a sudden leak was discovered in the dam, and river water seeped in. The villagers stopped working. At that time, Zhu Biao, the District Chief of the district, happened to be there. He urgently ordered the villagers to block the leak with hemp bags and continue dredging as usual. However, the villagers wanted to take the opportunity to stop work. District Chief Zhu explained the importance of the matter, but the villagers rebelled, surrounded District Chief Zhu, and then took him to the home of Shengdian Township Chief Zhang Erjia, completely destroying the Zhang family's belongings. District Chief Zhu was also severely beaten by the crowd. He was escorted to Ouctang Bridge by the security team, then traveled by rickshaw to the city to report to the Construction Bureau, which reported it to the county government for strict punishment. District Chief Zhu was sent to Pu Ren Hospital for medical treatment, and there is no major danger.</p>
<h3>Dredging the Lü River Causes Uprising</h3>
<p>The dredging of six major rivers in Wuxi as a form of work relief is currently underway in full swing. Among them, the Wenjiang River project in the fourth district is the largest. District Chief Zhu personally oversees the work, resulting in particularly good progress. The project has now reached the Shengdian Bridge section. The district has tasked each Baojia (local administrative unit) to be fully responsible, with each household providing one worker, and each worker receiving seven He (a unit of dry measure) of rice and one hundred Wen (copper coins) per day. On the morning before yesterday, while over seven hundred workers were working, a leak suddenly appeared in the dam foundation at the river end. River water flowed in rapidly. District Chief Zhu immediately ordered the leak to be plugged with sacks and straw so that work could continue as usual. Unexpectedly, a small number of villagers shouted for work to stop, claiming that the river dredging was initiated by Zhang Erjia, the Shengdian Bridge township head, because Zhang's family fields were all along the river, and the dredging would benefit him personally. Their call was echoed by many, causing great disturbance. District Chief Zhu tried to stop them without success. They then forced Zhu to the Dade Tang grocery store and further claimed they needed to hold a meeting at the tea shop, causing the order to break down completely, and the situation became very serious. The fourth squadron of the security team stationed in the township was unable to suppress the unrest. Subsequently, they escorted District Chief Zhu to the home of township head Zhang Erjia, during which Zhu was severely beaten by random fists along the way. Items in Zhang's house were also destroyed. The villagers, realizing they had caused trouble, then returned home. Yesterday, Zhu came to the city to report to the county and the Construction Bureau on what had happened. He also went to Puren Hospital for medical treatment, and immediately returned to the township to handle the aftermath. The ringleaders among the rioting villagers have been identified by the county government and will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Shortage of Silkworm Eggs, Request for Relief</h3>
<p>The four rural townships of Wu County suffered from drought and poor harvests last year. This spring, successive snowstorms and heavy rains have occurred. The wheat crop is almost hopeless. Villagers place their only hope on the benefits of sericulture. However, this year's silkworm eggs are under the control of the provincial government and sold officially, with supply falling short of demand. Villagers have money but nowhere to buy them. Statistics show that as of recently, only 20% of mixed-breed silkworm eggs have been obtained. If no timely measures are taken, farmers' livelihoods will be cut off, and mulberry trees will become useless. The Xilin and other townships in the second district, as well as the Xiaohe Town and other areas in the west, believing that the time for silkworm rearing has passed, have sent telegrams to the county's silkworm improvement district, requesting that eggs be transported to the villages immediately for relief. The improvement district has ordered 10,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs and is urging their transport to Changzhou for distribution to the villages.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Tragedy at Dragon Boat Race</h3>
<p>Every year on the 20th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, Changshu holds dragon boat races outside the Li Wang Temple in the west gate. This year's event was particularly grand. Many men and women from the city rented boats to watch, and it was as if they were drunk or crazy, exceptionally lively. Unexpectedly, a tragic collapse of a foreign-style balcony occurred, injuring more than ten students from the Shuqin Girls' School. Shen Zhuqing, a resident outside the west gate, had a daughter studying at Shuqin Girls' School. On this day, due to the proximity of the location, Shen's daughter invited her classmates to her home to watch the race. Some of them went upstairs to watch from the balcony, which unexpectedly collapsed. Dozens of girls fell at the same time, all suffering injuries. Among them, Pang Yixin and Zhang Guiying were most severely injured and passed out on the spot. In addition, more than ten others, such as Zhou Qiaomin, Gui Jiduan, Du Jiafu, Wang Yuefen, and Xu Peihua, suffered either leg fractures or broken arms. The scene was extremely tragic. Currently, except for Pang and Zhang, who may become disabled, the others are not in serious condition.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Telegram Request to Waive Collection of Salt Tax</h3>
<p>The Joint Association for Maintaining the Salt Industry of various legal entities in Jiangdu, because Commissioner Miao suddenly ordered the collection of salt tax, which they considered an ill-intentioned transformation of the Seven Companies' relocation, causing alarm among those who heard it. They resolved to send telegrams separately to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Huai Commissioner, requesting the withdrawal of the order. The original telegram is recorded below: Our Yangzhou has never had large-scale production. We rely entirely on the salt industry for financial turnover. Therefore, the salt industry's prosperity is of great importance to the locality. The reason why our people maintain the salt industry is to protect the local area. The current government is making every effort to carry out construction. If the local market declines and the people's livelihood deteriorates, what construction can be spoken of? Therefore, last year, Commissioner Miao ordered the Seven Companies to move north, which caused extreme panic among the local people, leading to a general strike of workers, businesses, and schools. The people dared to offend authority because they had no other choice. Fortunately, Commissioner Miao understood the people's concerns and resolutely discussed the matter with the people, deciding not to allow the Seven Companies to move north and making sincere declarations. The people were grateful and still remember it vividly. Not long ago, Commissioner Miao again ordered the collection of salt tax. When the news came out, the Seven Companies could not settle down, and local people who had deposits in the companies and those who did business with the companies turned pale, fearing that the collection of salt tax was a disguise for the relocation of the companies, greatly affecting the local market. Upon hearing this news, our people were extremely anxious. Therefore, after discussions among various legal entities, it was decided to send a telegram humbly requesting you to consider the difficulties of the people, to instruct Commissioner Miao to withdraw the order, and to avoid another disturbance of strikes and school boycotts. Our telegram is urgent, and we await your command.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Change of County Public Security Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Fu Qianzhi, the chief of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, has requested to resign. The provincial government has appointed Song Mingxin to succeed him. Song is from Sichuan and was originally a section chief in the Nantong District Administrative Inspector's Office. The new and old bureau chiefs will take office next month.</p>
<h3>Appeal in Lawyer Rape Case</h3>
<p>The prosecutor has appealed the acquittal by the criminal court in the case of Wu Guixin, vice-chairman of the Nantong Lawyers Association, for raping his niece Li Xiangzhi, to the High Court. The trial is scheduled for May 7, and the Nantong Court has been ordered to investigate the evidence nearby.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Severe Spring Famine in Southeast Townships</h3>
<p>The spring famine in the southeast townships of Changjing, Gushan, Huashu, Yangku, etc., is particularly severe, as they suffered a severe drought last summer. Zhang Mingshun, a special commissioner from the county party headquarters, went to the villages to investigate. The famine is especially severe in the northern part of Huasha Yasha Mountain. Extremely poor households are mixing duckweed and bran to cook and eat. Few can afford to eat thin porridge. The Gushan and Huashu township offices have collected several thousand yuan to buy rice and distribute it by grade. In the Yangku area, there are more than 4,000 extremely poor households and about 3,000 moderately poor households. After investigation by Special Commissioner Zhang, it is estimated that Hua Shu needs about 7,000 yuan, and Changjing, Gushan, etc., need about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan to maintain the food supply for the disaster victims until the new grains come on the market. Various poor households in the villages, unable to bear the hunger, intend to demand food from wealthy households in the towns, which has a great impact on public security. Special Commissioner Zhang has now returned to the city and will actively organize and establish a spring famine relief committee this week, formulate measures, and start handling relief so that there are no starving people in the fields and local public security can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Yufeng Dragon Association Resolves to Strike</h3>
<p>Since Jiang Yanchun, a section chief of the Public Security Bureau, disrupted the theater and obstructed the dragon affairs, thousands of righteous dragon members carried the dragon to the Public Security Bureau, causing the gatekeeper to fire a gun, which caused a major uproar. It has been repeatedly reported in the Shanghai-Hangzhou newspapers. Recently, after mediation by others, the dragon was sent back, and the county government was requested to arrest the two police officers who fired the shots. Jiang Yanchun was temporarily placed under the custody of the Public Security Bureau chief, pending the county magistrate's return to the county for disposition. Unexpectedly, the police of the Public Security Bureau were dissatisfied with the mediation and requested the county government to release the two police officers who fired the shots, and went on strike to protest. Yesterday, the Xinbao'an, Shou Kang, Qiyuan, and other dragon associations published statements in the newspaper, stating that they would resign en masse, and would not respond to fire alarms. The Yuxiu Dragon Association of the West Gate also held a meeting and resolved that, because the water dragon had been destroyed by the bureau police, in addition to going on strike and refusing to respond to fire alarms, they could also negotiate compensation with the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Carelessness at the Weixin Cloth Factory</h3>
<p>The Weixin Cloth Factory on Huayan Street, Jiangdong, Ningbo, is solely owned by Wang Changting, a native of Deng Dongmo Zhiyan. It has been in business for more than 20 years. The factory was originally located in Mozhiyan, and it was moved to Jiangdong three years ago. Sixteen factory buildings were built to continue operations. There are more than 50 partners and workers in the factory, and their families live there. Normally, the factory's products are quite profitable. At about 12 o'clock last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the staircase behind the factory's accounting office. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames erupted through the roof, making it impossible to approach. After the fire brigade's forceful efforts to extinguish the fire, it was put out after an hour. Sixteen buildings were burned down, with a total loss of about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Five Steamship Companies Request Prohibition of Sampans Picking Up Passengers</h3>
<p>The five steamship companies operating routes to Shanghai, namely Jinfeng, Daxing, Dada Ningxing, and Ping'an, believe that the sampans in various ports of the county are secretly stealing passengers, which has repeatedly caused disasters. They have requested and been approved by the county government to issue a notice prohibiting sampans from approaching steamships to pick up passengers in order to ensure the safety of travelers. Unexpectedly, after a long time, people became lax. Recently, sampan operators at various ports have been rushing to solicit passengers when the steamships arrive, which is extremely dangerous. They have jointly resolved to refuse sampans to approach steamships to solicit passengers starting from May 1. Yesterday (the 18th), they jointly submitted a request to the county government to reiterate the ban and order the military police stationed in the ports and the naval vessels to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Boat Capsizes in Qiantang River, Drowning Five</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, two seagoing vessels from the Yu family in Xixiang, Xiaoshan, fully loaded with small yellow croaker, intended to unload at Wenjiayan. Unexpectedly, when they sailed to the Dianyu Mouth area, they were swept down by the upriver mountain water and sank immediately. Five of the eleven boatmen drowned. The remaining seven were skilled swimmers and were rescued by fishing boats and rafts from Tantou, allowing them to escape and be reborn.</p>

<h3>Article 13 of the Factory Law: Extension of Preparatory Period Until August 1st of Next Year: Municipal Government Has Approved the Ministry's Consultation: Temporarily Maintaining the Livelihood of Female Workers Due to the Economic Distress of Domestic Industries</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Government has approved a consultation from the Ministry of Industry, which states: "Regarding the instructions in Executive Yuan Order No. 2049, the ministry previously submitted a report (Lao Zi No. 3593) asking whether the preparatory period for the implementation of Article 13 of the Factory Law, which has now exceeded the permitted period, should be extended or immediately enforced. The matter was forwarded to the Central Political Conference for review and instruction. This was brought before the 205th meeting of the Executive Yuan, which forwarded the matter to the Central Political Conference for approval. We have now received National Government Instruction No. 286, which states: "The Central Political Conference, in its letter of March 28, 1935, approved the following: Article 13 of the Factory Law, regarding the ban on night work for female workers, was previously resolved at the 282nd meeting of the conference to have a two-year preparatory period for implementation, overseen by the Ministry of Industry. The government was also instructed to comply. The secretariat of the conference presented a letter from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Factory Law came into effect on August 1, 1931. The preparatory period for Article 13 has now exceeded two years. However, considering the state of domestic industries, which have recently deteriorated, especially the textile industry, and that the majority of factory workers in that industry are female, if night work is prohibited, male workers would need to be trained to replace them, and the skilled female workers currently employed would suddenly lose their jobs, which would significantly impact production volume and workers' livelihoods. It was asked whether the preparatory period for the article should be extended or immediately enforced. The matter was brought before the 205th meeting of the Executive Yuan, which resolved to forward the matter to the Central Political Conference for approval and requested a response. This was brought before the 450th meeting of the conference, which resolved that the preparatory period for the implementation of Article 13 of the Factory Law should be extended to August 1, 1936. The matter is recorded and the original letter from the Executive Yuan is attached. Please review, instruct compliance, and so on." Therefore, we should comply accordingly. In addition to replying by letter, we hereby order that the department comply accordingly. This order is hereby issued. We have received this order. In addition to issuing it separately, we hereby consult you for your review and instruction."</p>
<h3>Lending and Borrowing Between Silver and Money Shops and the Three Banks: The Number of Applicants Has Gradually Decreased Yesterday: Money Shops Must Re-Negotiate Loan Extensions: The "劃頭" (Hua Tou) Rose Sharply to Four 角 (Jiao) Silver, and Credit Has Tightened</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports: After the Central, China, and Communications Banks continued to handle interbank lending, the market has tended to stabilize. The money shops have accommodated requests for loan extensions from industrial and commercial enterprises. However, credit has become tighter than before. The details are reported below.</p>
<p>Three Banks' Lending: About 8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>For the sake of rescuing the market, the Central, China, and Communications Banks jointly conducted interbank lending before the closing of accounts in 1934, presided over by the Central Bank. In view of the impending end of April, the lending was continued. The silver and money shops were very enthusiastic in their applications. By yesterday's deadline, including the old loans extended, the total reached 7.9 million yuan. Since yesterday, the number of applicants from silver and money shops has gradually decreased because the market has stabilized through the lending of the three banks. This lending indirectly rescued industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Extended Loans: Must Be Re-Negotiated</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the money shops yesterday that the money shops decided to accommodate long-term credit loans to industrial and commercial enterprises that were due at the end of April as much as possible, depending on their own strength. As for the statement that the money shops would increase interest on long-term credit loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, the money shops stated yesterday that the money shops determine the interest rate on various long-term credit loans based on the market's supply and demand, and it is not uniform. After the end of April, when spring cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang enter the market, demand will be greater, and the interest rate should be re-negotiated and a contract renewed.</p>
<p>"劃頭" (Hua Tou) Rises Sharply: Silver and Credit Tighten Gradually</p>
<p>In the money shop market, the morning and afternoon Shanghai Silver drafts were both 一角 (one Jiao) yesterday, while the "劃頭加水" (Hua Tou Jia Shui) was initially 三角 (three Jiao) yesterday, and then rose to 四角 (four Jiao), which proves that the money shops' payments to the banks have increased sharply. Although the Shanghai Silver draft rate was the same as in previous days, credit was actually tighter than before because supply and demand could not meet each other. However, according to the money shop industry, this is a phenomenon that is bound to occur at the end of April every year.</p>
<h3>Huaming Silver Shop Closes Down: Capital of 60,000 Yuan, Deposits of Over 200,000 Yuan: Related to Yongxing and Tongtai</h3>
<p>The Guo Wen News Agency reports: The Huaming Silver Shop, located at No. 220 Jiujiang Road in this port, suddenly announced on the previous day, through lawyer and accountant Yu, that it would temporarily cease operations due to the market's decline and tight credit. The circumstances are recorded below.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Closure: Huaming Silver Shop was established in the winter of 1931 and was a joint-stock enterprise, similar in nature to a small money shop. The total capital was only 60,000 yuan. The manager, Qian Fuqu, has been running it for three years, gradually absorbing more than 200,000 yuan in deposits, which were re-loaned to fellow businesses or shops. Recently, due to the poor market situation, they could not be recovered temporarily, resulting in a lack of cash and sluggish turnover. The decision to temporarily cease operations was made the night before last. Accountant Wang Sifang was entrusted to conduct accounting. The lawyer said that it would be possible to determine whether the business could be restored after the accounts were checked. However, according to a reporter's investigation, the closure of the shop this time is related to the bankruptcies of Yongxing and Tongtai Shunji, two remittance and money shops that occurred the day before yesterday, and may have been forced to close as a result. Therefore, it is not yet known whether they can reorganize. The shop's staff has been dismissed, leaving only two apprentices. The names of the shareholders are currently being kept secret by the lawyer.</p>
<p>Lawyer's Announcement: Accountant Wang Sifang and Lawyer Hong Shihao announced the temporary closure of Huaming Silver Shop, stating: "According to the manager of Huaming Silver Shop, due to the market depression and tight credit, the turnover is not smooth, and they are unable to cope. They have no choice but to temporarily cease operations and suspend receipts and payments, and then consult on a solution. Therefore, the accountant and lawyer are specially entrusted to announce this. This is announced on behalf of Accountant Wang Sifang and Lawyer Hong Shihao on April 23."</p>
<h3>Issuing Real Estate Currency: Difficult to Implement: The Government Has Concrete Measures to Help Industry and Commerce: All Parties Agree That Issuance Is Unnecessary</h3>
<p>The proposal by real estate merchants in this city to issue 450 million yuan of real estate currency to regulate finance and help the market is facing difficulties. Although industry insiders have repeatedly consulted, no concrete progress has been made. Most parties concerned in this city also believe that this suggestion of real estate merchants is difficult to implement and rarely agree. According to general observation, the reason why the issuance of such bonds is not easy is already well known. Even if it can be implemented, there are doubts about whether people from all walks of life can accept such bonds. As for saving the declining market and activating finance, the government has long considered it. The issuance of 100 million yuan of financial bonds in 1935 was to strengthen the strength of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, so as to lend to industry and commerce as much as possible to facilitate turnover. The Ministry of Finance recently ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to jointly organize a 20 million yuan large loan with the Bankers Association to relieve the current economic difficulties of industry and commerce. At the same time, the competent authorities were ordered to properly study the methods of abolishing and reducing transit taxes and export taxes, with the aim of implementing them on June 1. It can be seen that the government has appropriate measures for rescuing finance and reviving the market, whether it is a symptomatic or fundamental solution. Therefore, the issuance of real estate currency is truly superfluous.</p>
<h3>Fan Yushui Comes to Shanghai: Negotiating Loans for Road Construction: Daoqing Road Will Extend to Daming</h3>
<p>Fan Yushui, director of the Daoqing Road Bureau, recently came to Nanjing to meet with Zeng Zhongming, a senior official of the Ministry of Railways, to discuss plans to extend the road to Daming. The results were satisfactory. Fan also came to Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd to negotiate loans with the banking community in this port and the British Fu Company, the creditor of Daoqing Road. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency specifically asked Fan about this matter during his stay, and he replied as follows.</p>
<p>History of Daoqing Road</p>
<p>Fan briefly said that the Daoqing Railway is in Henan Province, starting from Daokou to Qinyang County, with a total length of 197.230 kilometers. The Management Bureau is located in Jiaozuo. The road was initially built by the British Fu Company for the purpose of transporting coal. After repeated negotiations with our country, we took back the road by borrowing 980,000 pounds, with the railway from Daokou to Qinghua as collateral, which had become a railway. It was repaid in twenty installments, with each installment requiring the repayment of more than 40,000 pounds, and paying 5% interest.</p>
<p>Extend the Road</p>
<p>However, the road is very short, and the income is flat. Although there is a slight surplus every year, it is very difficult to pay off the debt. Therefore, we are now planning to extend the road to Daming in Hebei. After this proposal is implemented, it is expected that the income can be increased a lot, and the payment of the debt will be more than enough. The construction cost is estimated to be 3 million yuan, 500,000 yuan is raised by the bureau, 1.2 million yuan for materials can be paid in installments, and the remaining 1.3 million yuan needs to be borrowed from the outside world.</p>
<p>Loan Plan</p>
<p>The purpose of my trip to Nanjing this time was to discuss the loan with the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry has agreed to this plan. So I came to Shanghai again to negotiate loans with the banking community and the Fu Company. At present, I first hope that the Fu Company can continue to invest, because the longer the road, the easier it is to repay the debt. However, the Fu Company's management office in China cannot make the decision and must wait for the company's annual meeting in London next month to make a decision. If the Fu Company cannot invest, then it is required to borrow money from the banking group with the remaining money of Daoqing Road as collateral. I have also contacted the banking sector once, and because the amount is not large, it is expected to be agreed. However, it is said that the time limit cannot be too long. I will report everything to the Ministry of Railways as soon as possible because I have a good idea of everything in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Student National Goods Annual Conference: Method of Soliciting Essays and Mutual Selection</h3>
<p>The Student National Goods Annual Promotion Committee, in order to solicit the opinions of students throughout the city, for the purpose of what should be done in the Student National Goods Year and how to complete the mission of the Student National Goods Year, held an essay contest for the special issue of the Student National Goods Year. Students from major primary and secondary schools throughout the city participated enthusiastically.

<h3>Various Facts of Siam's Discrimination Against Chinese - Overseas Chinese Representatives Have Returned Home to Petition</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the imposition of harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education and restrictions on overseas Chinese business and residence by Siam, although denied by Mr. Cai Wei'er, the head of the Siamese Far East Inspection Group in Shanghai, reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency continued to inquire with the United Association of Overseas Chinese and the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday, and it was indeed confirmed to be the case. The details obtained are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Forced Study of Siamese</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese education regulations promulgated by the Siamese government last year initially stipulated that all overseas Chinese schools must set up a so-called compulsory class. Overseas Chinese children aged seven to fourteen must receive education in this class, studying Siamese for more than 23 hours per week. This regulation was revised this year, abolishing the compulsory class and further stipulating that all overseas Chinese children from the age of seven to fourteen must directly enter Siamese schools and receive full Siamese education. Furthermore, overseas Chinese schools are required to send students to Siamese schools to study Siamese exclusively for six months. Only after passing the examination and obtaining a certificate issued by the Ministry of Education are schools allowed to hire them. Those who fail the first exam are allowed to continue studying Siamese for six months and take the exam again. Now, after failing once, their qualifications are immediately revoked, and they are no longer given the opportunity to take the exam again.</p>
<p>Forced Siamese Nationality</p>
<p>In the past, when overseas Chinese entered Siam, they had to pay a so-called "political contribution fee" of six Siamese dollars each year and were issued a card, the content of which actually stated that the person had acquired Siamese nationality. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, in addition to paying the political contribution fee, they have also had to pay a so-called "entry tax" upon initial entry. Initially, it was ten Siamese dollars, then increased to fifty dollars, and now it has increased to as much as one hundred and twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Business</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese students who return to their home country to study are considered by the government as studying abroad. When leaving the country, they must pay a so-called "security deposit" (meaning a deposit) of five hundred dollars and are restricted to return to Siam within a certain number of years. Otherwise, their families will be subject to punishment. All overseas Chinese stores must employ one Siamese person as an employee. Overseas Chinese factories must employ as many Siamese people as possible. In addition, there are high business taxes and income taxes, not to mention.</p>
<p>Assimilation Policy</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, the secretary of the United Association of Overseas Chinese, has traveled in Siam for many years and has just returned. According to him, Siamese people are not good at business. All large enterprises are in the hands of overseas Chinese. The Siamese government believes that its own population is very small, and there are many overseas Chinese traveling in Siam. It also covets the economic power of overseas Chinese. Therefore, it tries to implement an assimilation policy on overseas Chinese, making overseas Chinese unconsciously recognize themselves as Siamese and forget their motherland. Limiting the study of Chinese and forcing the study of Siamese are all its means. Recently, it is preparing to implement the policy that anyone of overseas Chinese descent born and raised in Siam will be recognized as Siamese.</p>
<p>Japanese Influence</p>
<p>The Siamese government is divided into two factions, democratic and monarchist. The democratic faction is close to Japan, and the monarchist faction is close to Britain. Now, the democratic faction is dominant. The Siamese government has 23 foreign advisers. Previously, British people were in the majority, and French, American, and Japanese people were fewer. Now, Japanese people account for 18 of the 23. It can be seen that Japan's influence in Siam is rising. Its educational adviser is Japanese. The harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education recently promulgated are for a good reason, and so on.</p>
<p>Representatives Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam have specially sent three representatives back to China to petition due to Siam's discrimination against Chinese. The representatives arrived in Shanghai some time ago and have been to Beijing to meet with the authorities.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Chuan Rulin took the night express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition - 17th Day of Pre-Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th) was the 17th day of the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. Various organizations and groups visited in succession for days. These included the Commercial Press, the Wuxi County Education Association, the China General Chamber of Commerce, the Economic Travel Agency, the International Education Association, the National Tariff Commission, the Jiangsu Cooperative Society, the Agricultural Products Marketing Office, the Second Special District Court, the Private Zhengshi Middle School, the Art College, the Postal Workers' Union, the Postal Employees' Union, the Medical Association, the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Management Office, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the YMCA Office, the Zhonghua Book Company Editorial Office, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau Economic Committee, the Cotton Industry Statistics Committee, the Central Trust Company, the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the Public Works Department, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Lake Society, the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, the Mayer Silk Weaving Factory, the Security Office, the Commercial Art Writers Association, the China Enamel Factory, the Reception Office of the American Economic Investigation Group, the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, and various schools. The archaeological selection examples displayed at this exhibition were sent by the Archaeological Group of the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica. The brief explanations were also written by the institute. However, they were sent to the exhibition later and were not included in the catalog. They are now excerpted in sections below for the reference of archaeologists. The archaeological selection exhibits are selected from those unearthed at Yinxu, unearthed at Xincun in Junxian, and purchased from the antique market in Anyang, Shanxi. They are divided into twelve categories: (1) Oracle bones for divination, (2) Oracle bone inscriptions, (3) Deer head inscriptions, (4) Stone knives, (5) Stone axes, (6) Bone hairpins, (7) Various bone tools, (8) Arrowheads, (9) Spears, halberds, and axes, (10) Bronze fragments, (11) Bronze molds, and (12) Bone carvings, ivory carvings, and stone carvings. The oracle bones and inscriptions unearthed at Yinxu for divination, (1) the art of using oracle bones for divination originated in ancient times and flourished in the Yin and Shang dynasties. No matter how big or small the matter, it must be decided by divination. Therefore, a large number of turtle shells for divination were unearthed at Yinxu. The method of divination is to first divide the dorsal and ventral shells of the turtle into two, and then scrape off the epidermis of the shell, scraping the inside and outside to make it semi-smooth. The historian applied drilling and chiseling on the inside and burned it with fire when in use. Cracks appeared on the outside to form omens to determine good and bad fortune. The ventral shell was used in its entirety, while the middle of the back shell was split longitudinally, dividing the left and right sides into two halves. Regarding the method of turtle divination in the Yin and Shang dynasties, please refer to Mr. Dong Zuobin's "Speculation on Turtle Divination in the Shang Dynasty" (contained in the first issue of the Anyang Excavation Report, pages 59-130). Ox scapula bones were also used for oracle bones. Both the left and right bones were used, and they were scraped smooth and straight with a knife and saw. The method of divination was the same as that of turtle shells. Drilling and chiseling were first applied, and then burning was used to seek omens. There were also many cases where only drilling or chiseling was applied, which were also unearthed in large numbers at Yinxu. (2) Oracle bone inscriptions. Oracle bone inscriptions unearthed at Yinxu were mostly used to record matters of divination. These inscriptions were recorded next to the omens after each divination. The items were about twelve categories: 1. Sacrifice, 2. Announcement, 3. Petition, 4. Going and stopping, 5. Field and fishing, 6. Conquest, 7. Year, 8. Wind and rain, 9. Rain, 10. Recovery, 11. Sentences and evenings, 12. Miscellaneous divination. Oracle bone inscriptions were discovered in the 25th year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1899 AD). Over the past 30 years, locals have excavated them many times, and tens of thousands of pieces have been unearthed. Nineteen kinds of books have been recorded, with more than 16,000 pieces. The essence is almost exhausted here. The excavation work of Yinxu by the Academia Sinica began in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928 AD). Up to now, nine excavations have been carried out, and more than 6,000 oracle bone inscriptions have been obtained, which is only one or two tenths of the total amount. However, due to the results of scientific excavation, the method of dating research is obtained based on stratigraphic pit positions and other standards, dividing the divination inscriptions into five periods: (1) Wuding and before, (2) Zugeng and Zujia, (3) Linxin and Kangding, (4) Wuyi and Wending, and (5) Diyi and Dixin. See Dong Zuobin's "Examples of Dating Research on Oracle Bones" for details (External Compilation of the Collected Works, Vol. 3, pp. 323-424). By studying with this method, all oracle bone inscriptions make the precious historical materials of the Yin Dynasty clearly divisible by era. (3) Deer head inscriptions. Only the frontal part and horn base of the deer head bone remain. The inscriptions are also missing. They record conquest and hunting events. From the shape and style of the characters, it can be proved to be a thing of the fifth period. The calligraphy is graceful, similar to the inscriptions on bronzes. The writing style is downward and to the left, which is the same as other animal inscriptions. It can be proved that the ordinary writing style of the Yin people is like this. The left and right lines of divination inscriptions are a special style to cater to the divination omens. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>Polish Goods Display Ship Open to the Public Yesterday - Mostly Light Industrial Products and Woolen Fabrics - Leaving Shanghai and Heading North on the Morning of the 27th</h3>

It opened to the public for three days yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the morning of the 27th, stay in Tanggu for half a day, and then sail to Dalian, then to Yokohama, Osaka, and other places in Japan for exhibition. It will return to Shanghai again next month, and a part of the exquisite samples will be permanently displayed in the Polish Chamber of Commerce in China at 21 Baokang Road. Yesterday, more than a thousand people went to visit one after another. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Polish Goods Open Exhibition (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>Ferry Shuttle</p>
<p>For the convenience of visitors, the Polish Chamber of Commerce in China has specially chartered two municipal ferries, No. 6 and the Blue Funnel Ferry, to provide free transportation for guests. The two ferries run back and forth between the Customs Wharf and the Blue Funnel Wharf every hour. The "Dar Pomorza" is a transportation ship. In addition to exhibiting commodities, it also carries a large number of steel industry products on this voyage to the Far East, which are currently being unloaded.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The exhibition venue is located in a first-floor cabin. Although the area is not very large, the display is well-organized and there are many items. On the red ground at the entrance, white iron Western characters are nailed, with the words "Polish Sample Model Exhibition", and a national emblem made in the same way is suspended below. On the wall on the left hand, a world map is hung, and on the right hand is a detailed map of Poland. Further in is the commodity exhibition venue. Most of the items on display are light industrial products, roughly divided into agricultural tools, wood, white lead, enamel, woolen fabrics, chemical industry, and glassware. All of them are Polish-made products. Although there are no particularly exquisite products among them, they are quite representative of the Polish light industry, which is steadily improving. The chemical industry products and wood samples are the most impressive. The slender cigarettes are also very unique, and the daily necessities and toys are very ingenious.</p>
<p>Reception of the Press</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the Polish Chamber of Commerce in China invited people from all walks of life and the Chinese and Western press to a tea party on board and to visit their samples. Mr. Zhudaski, the acting president of the Chamber of Commerce, and others warmly received them. Dr. Glinski, the Polish Consul General in Shanghai, and Wassel, the counselor of the Polish embassy, also visited the ship. According to representatives of the Polish Export Trade Department, the samples participating in the exhibition represent the products of 70 large factories in Poland. The Polish National Forest Factory Tobacco and Salt Monopoly Bureau, the National Travel Company, and the Travel Bureau of the Polish Ministry of Transport also participated with goods. As for bulky machines and other products, there are photos and detailed explanatory books. The display ship departed from the port of Gdynia, Poland on March 2nd, passed through the South Pacific Islands to China, and stopped for exhibitions in Piran, Sevilleton, Singapore, and Hong Kong along the way. After exhibiting in Shanghai for three days, it will then go north to Tianjin, stay at the Tanggu port for half a day, and then go to Dalian, and then to Yokohama, Osaka, and other places, and return to China via Shanghai next month.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Presents to the Executive Yuan - Requesting Industrial Control - To Save the Decline of Industry - To Avoid Overproduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday, stating: It is hereby presented that in order to save the decline of industry, it is appropriate to start with integrated production to avoid overproduction. Sixteen draft control regulations are hereby proposed for selection. Please approve and implement them. According to the proposal of Jin Jian, a standing committee member of the Chamber, in the case of the draft, it is found that the economic decline of our country has reached its peak. Since the New Year, all industries in the country have been calling for relief, and the dangerous situation cannot be sustained for a day. There are many reasons for this, but the large-scale dumping of foreign industrial products and the fact that our country's industry is a mess of loose sand with no resistance ability are also major reasons. Our country's industry is still in its infancy. Its production management, machinery and equipment, etc. are all more backward than foreigners. Even if all factories in the same industry have long-term vision and have organized alliances to compete with imported goods, they may not be able to gain an advantage due to the inability to match the quality and cost of others. What's more, domestic industries are all fighting on their own. Not only are they not connected to seek a unified approach to the outside world, but they even infringe on each other. Most of them only seek private interests and hold the heart of "I die you live". Or they cut prices to compete for sales, or they manufacture shoddy goods to deceive for a while. In the former case, the cost cannot be guaranteed, and in the latter case, the inferior goods are difficult to sustain. Gradually, the losses are increasing, and they are all doomed to perish. This is the phenomenon of domestic industry today, and it can be said that eight or nine out of ten have this situation. In addition, the Chinese people are good at blindly following. Whenever an industry is established, it is often because they have heard that someone has profited in this industry, and they rashly engage in it. There is no accurate investigation, and there is a lack of complete statistics. There are often new factories being established in industries that have already produced excess. The result is naturally the same as the road to ruin. In recent years, due to the sluggish market and the bankruptcy of the countryside, the excess of various industrial products has become even more prosperous. People of insight also advocate the alliance of industries to save themselves, but they are all flashes in the pan and soon dissipate. For example, the rubber industry, the match industry, the enamel industry, and the cement industry. The reason is that they are controlled by large factories or are selfish by a small part. They are all ignorant of the overall situation and cannot be frank with each other. Each industry that has not yet tried to establish an alliance, although suffering, is drawn as a warning by the failure of other industries and dares not try it. If the government does not formulate industrial control laws and regulations and force them to be controlled by industry, I am afraid that if they are allowed to go their own way, in a few years, our country's industry will be completely defeated, and the collapse of the national economy can be expected. For this reason, a draft of industrial control regulations is drafted and submitted for discussion, and it is proposed that this association submit it to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan, requesting immediate approval and promulgation of industrial control regulations, so that the production and sales statistics of the national industry can be established as a result. Each industry can form an organized and strong defense line through the regulations, which is a weapon to compete with foreign goods externally and to consolidate the foundation of the national economy internally. The dying vitality of the country may be preserved by this, and the lifeless industry can also be revived as a result. This is truly a benefit to the industry and the people's livelihood. Whether it is appropriate or not, please wait for the public decision, etc. When the tenth executive committee meeting of the Chamber was held on the 19th of this month, it was submitted for discussion. Everyone believed that the purchasing power of the people in the inland of our country is shrinking day by day due to successive disasters and crop failures, and the producers are taking care of their own interests without any overall plan and steps, resulting in overproduction, losses, and bankruptcy, and repeated mistakes. The reasons for the failure of the rubber and match industries mentioned in the original case are sufficient to prove the above point. Recently, many provinces have also tried to implement planned production plans, but because the matter is of great importance, local trials are ultimately not as easy to promote and as beneficial as central planning. It was resolved to attach the full text of the draft regulations, submit them for review, and approve the adoption and implementation, which would be fair and convenient.</p>
<h3>Qu Xiaoqi, a Chinese Aviation Talent</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that Hua Xigui, (translated) the first Chinese qualified pilot of the Far East Aviation School, is said to be Hua Wen, the second son of Qu Leqing, the manager of the Anle Garden branch of Nanjing Road in this city, formerly known as Qu Xiaoqi. After graduation, he was hired by his alma mater as a mechanical engineering teacher.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Construction Department Sends Personnel to Shanghai - To Contact for Promotion of Guangdong Province Goods</h3>
<p>Ying Gao, secretary of the Guangdong Construction Department, expressed great satisfaction to the authorities. He arrived in port on the President Coolidge yesterday. According to a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao who visited him at his residence yesterday, Guangdong has been actively developing industries under the provincial government. The production of sugar and silk weaving has reached a prosperous period so far, and the annual surplus is huge. Because the power of foreign goods in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is extremely large, and domestic goods are dying, it is planned to transport a part of the domestic goods produced in Guangdong province to Shanghai for promotion. Currently, four categories have been determined: white sugar, sulfuric acid, silk fabrics, and cement. In the future, depending on the needs of the market, the goods will gradually be increased.</p>
<h3>Brick and Ash Industry - Aviation National Salvation Donation to be Collected</h3>
<p>In order to raise aviation national salvation funds, the Shanghai Municipal Collection Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association previously convened a meeting of various industries in the brick and tile transportation industry and passed a resolution to collect an aviation national salvation donation of 20,000 yuan. The original proposal was transferred to the Brick and Ash Industry Association and passed as it was. The date for collection was then decided and reported in various newspapers. The Brick and Ash Industry Association convened an executive and supervisory committee meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the collection of the aviation national salvation donation. The attendees were Ying Jisheng, Wu Mengsheng, Xi Binsheng, Zhu Weixin, Xu Shouzhong, Xue Jizhou, Ma Fuxin, Zhang Jusheng, and Xu Botang. The Team Leader's Office of the Aviation Association sent Zhang Yuliang to attend and provide guidance. The meeting was chaired by Wu Mengsheng and recorded by Zhou Baiqi. The chairman reported that the various industries in the brick and ash industry had passed the various motions for the collection of the aviation national salvation donation. Please express your opinions as much as possible for discussion. Then, Zhang Yuliang, the representative of the office, reported on the situation of the previous meeting of the transportation industry representatives and the importance of aviation construction. The discussion then began, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The principle of collecting the aviation national salvation donation was passed. (2) It was decided to appoint Gu Jisheng, Wu Mengsheng, Xu Shouzhong, Gong Binsheng, Shen Hongfei, and Xue Jizhou to represent the brick and ash industry and participate in the joint committee formed by the transportation industry to be in charge of the matter. The detailed organization law will be decided by the bilateral meeting. (3) It was requested that Wu Mengsheng, Xu Shouzhong, Xi Binsheng, Shen Hongfei, and Xue Jizhou be additionally appointed as deputy team leaders of the 200th team of the solicitation team, and Zhang Jusheng, Chen Yue, Li Weixin, Ma Fuxin, Xu Botang, Cai Shumei, Hu Qingchen, and Gu Deming as team members. (4) The collection of the aviation national salvation donation was passed as the original 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Chen Kuangzheng, the leader of Team 335, recommended the additional appointment of Jin Jihong, Zheng Yixin, Ma Yinghui, Ni Jiemin, Bao Ruwei, Yuan Bocheng, Yao Wenxun, and seven others as deputy team leaders of the team. Zheng Zenan, the leader of Team 6, added Zhu Xieqing, Qian Chongfu, Yan Shanzhou, He Zhiqin, and Xu Chuangeng, and others as deputy team leaders. Chen Liting, the leader of Team 69, requested the additional appointment of Wei Guangzheng, Gu Yunsun, Yang Yihui, Chuan Qinghuai, Yang Huaikui, and Liu Yuwan, etc. as deputy team leaders. The Team Leader's Office has already appointed them separately and issued letters of appointment.</p>
<p>After the Team Leader's Office directly solicited members, Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, and Hebei provinces successively requested the issuance of articles of association or joined as members, which was very enthusiastic. It is reported that Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, joined as a supporting member and paid a membership fee of 50 yuan. Sheng Qingsheng, Chen Hongbin, and Zhenhua Paint Company joined as special members. This city and various provinces, cities, and counties successively requested to join as ordinary members and sent membership fees and application forms. There must be dozens of cases every day, which shows that the people of the whole country spare no effort in supporting the aviation national salvation movement.</p>

<h3>Xianyang to Establish Cotton Baling Plant; Machinery Already Ordered in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The northwestern provinces are rich in resources. Domestic individuals have come to develop these areas in recent years in an endless stream. In addition, since the Longhai Railway opened to traffic, transportation has become convenient and the transport of goods no longer poses difficulties. Therefore, the development of industry and commerce in these provinces has been rapid in recent years, and among the various abundant products, Shaanxi cotton is the richest. As a result, cotton baling plants established due to cotton production in Shaanxi Province are flourishing everywhere like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In addition to Baoji and Shaanzhou, which have already been established for some time, other places such as Xi'an and Weinan have also been established one after another recently. Giant merchants Lü Xing-san, Zhou Han-seng, and Zhu Heng-tang, etc., recognizing that the area near Xianyang is rich in cotton production, have specially invited Liu Chui-shan, secretary of the Shaanxi Construction Department and deputy manager of the Bank of Communications branch, to establish the Lisheng Cotton Machine Baling Plant there to develop the local cotton planting business. It is reported that the factory's machinery has already been ordered in Shanghai by Zhu Wei-tang and will be shipped and installed soon.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Separate Letters Explaining that Delivery Receipts Do Not Need to Be Stamped; Interim Regulations Contain No Explicit Stipulation for Stamping; Department Order Also Contains a Statement to Temporarily Suspend Stamping</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, because 99 delivery receipts from the local Rui Da Coal Company were not stamped, was fined 1,000 yuan. It has specifically based its appeal on the interim stamp tax regulations, which contain no explicit stipulation for stamping goods receipts, and on the fact that the Ministry order also contains a statement to temporarily suspend stamping. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to the Finance and Taxation Bureau and the First Special District Local Court, explaining the correction. The letter stated: "To whom it may concern, on the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Coal Industry Association stating that a member, Rui Da Coal Company, had received an order from the Stamp Office of the工部局 Legal Department on the 1st of this month to inspect the stamp tax. Personnel were sent to the company to inspect the original copy of two books transcribed in foreign languages, one code book, four receipts, and 99 delivery receipts. At that time, it was considered a violation of regulations for not stamping, and it was intended to pay a supplementary tax of several tens of dollars. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, a summons was received from the First Special District Court, stating that an inquiry would be held in the Fifth Tribunal on the 18th. The company waited as scheduled, and after the inquiry and defense concluded, without any request, a harsh fine of 1,000 yuan was imposed. The company felt extremely apprehensive. Upon investigation, the 99 delivery receipts were in triplicate: (1) given to the customer; (2) stamped and signed and brought back by the store; (3) kept in the company for reference. The copy kept by the customer is used as an invoice and has been stamped. The second and third copies do not need to be stamped according to law. We respectfully request that your association join with the municipal authorities to protest for an exemption, which is of the utmost urgency. Further investigation reveals that the Finance Ministry has already approved and issued an order to temporarily suspend the stamping of delivery receipts. Now, the 99 delivery receipts of the member Rui Da Coal Company are actually duplicate copies of the delivery slips, and the original copies have already been stamped in accordance with regulations. These duplicate copies should be allowed a temporary suspension of stamping. Unexpectedly, the First Special District Court actually imposed a penalty, which is obviously inappropriate. Therefore, we are specifically forwarding the situation, earnestly requesting that your association investigate and forward the letter to the court, asking for an exemption from the fine to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, etc." An investigation reveals that the 99 delivery receipts confiscated from the company are goods receipts. According to the current interim stamp tax regulations, only money receipts require stamping, and there is no provision for stamping goods receipts. This is different from the stamp tax law promulgated on December 8th of last year, which has not yet been implemented, which stipulates that both money receipts and goods receipts must be stamped. Since the stamp tax law has not yet been scheduled for implementation, stores have not stamped their delivery receipts because the current interim stamp tax regulations contain no explicit provision for stamping, and therefore have not violated the regulations. To avoid misunderstandings among enforcement personnel, the Department order also contains a statement to temporarily suspend stamping. According to the aforementioned situation, the company was mistakenly fined a large amount of 1,000 yuan, which is a significant matter regarding the business rights and interests of merchants. In addition to sending a reply to the association, instructing the party concerned to file an appeal in accordance with the law, all goods receipts are not required to be stamped according to the current regulations, and we are corresponding to your office and court for investigation, which is sincerely hoped for."</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Announces Changes to the Collection of House Tax; Issues Notices Setting a Deadline for Self-Payment; Overdue Payments will be Fined 2%</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday issued Notice No. 292 to improve the collection of house tax. It stated, in brief, that the house tax in this district has always been collected by the bureau's collection offices, which fill out bills quarterly and send personnel to collect them. However, since there are many residents, it is necessary to improve the collection method. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 13 and 16 of the revised municipal house tax regulations, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the central government for approval, starting this summer, for all house taxes of 10 yuan or more, the collection offices will distribute notices before the start of each quarter. After receiving the notice, residents must bring the notice to the office for payment within 15 days. If they do not go to the office for payment within 10 days after the deadline, they will be charged a fine of 2% of the tax amount. If the tax amount is less than 10 yuan, the collection office will still send personnel to collect it from each household. As for the half of the tax that should be paid by the landlord, it will be paid on their behalf by the tenants and deducted from the rent. In addition to sending police to collect taxes when necessary, water and electricity can be cut off.</p>
<h3>Jiejiang Company Denies Selling Ships</h3>
<p>The Jiejiang Company sent a letter to this newspaper stating, "To the editor, today's local news in your newspaper carried a report that our company will sell nine Jianglun ships to the China Merchants Bureau.

This can be verified by inquiring with the China Merchants Bureau. Therefore, we request that your newspaper correct this. Furthermore, all of our company's ships are the newest types on the Yangtze River and are worth a total of 5 million yuan. We have absolutely no intention of selling them."

<h3>Another Thug Uses Drugs to Rob Prostitutes of Clothing and Jewelry; Pharmacies Should Pay Close Attention to the Sale of Drugs; Yu Zhi's Desire for Profit Blinds Him and Causes Him to Take Risks</h3>
<p>Recently, several cases have occurred in this city where thugs have used drugs to rob prostitutes of clothing and jewelry. The police have solved two cases and sent them to court for severe punishment. Now, another individual, Yu Zhi-sheng, has used this method to rob a private prostitute named Zhou Yu-ying of her clothing and jewelry, and the police have also solved the case. If this trend continues, there is bound to be more imitation. Therefore, it is hoped that all pharmacies will pay close attention when selling drugs that can impair people's judgment, which may be able to prevent such crimes to some extent. The details of the Yu Zhi-sheng case are recorded below. Yu Zhi-sheng, a native of Shaoxing, is 26 years old. He came to Shanghai in 1928 and studied medicine at a hospital on Hualong Road, French Concession, for about a year and a half. After completing his apprenticeship, he opened his own Yu Zeni (his style name) Hospital at 12 Kangdi Road for about two years. Because</p>
<p>His Career Did Not Prosper</p>
<p>He was forced to close it. Then he went to Suzhou, but he was also unable to achieve success. He returned to Shanghai this spring to seek employment, but he was unsuccessful. When it was becoming difficult for him to maintain his livelihood, he saw a newspaper report about a case where a prostitute was drugged and robbed at the Yangtze Hotel. His desire for profit blinded him, and he disregarded the severity of the law and took a risk. On the 15th of this month, he bought a large bottle of drugs for one yuan and ten cents at a pharmacy in the French Concession. Then, on the evening of the 18th, he first went to the Meng Yuan Hotel at 127 Hubei Road and registered room 116 under the name Zheng Tian-wen. After placing the drugs, he went to the Tian Yun Lou amusement park at the Wing On Company to have fun.</p>
<p>Then He Saw a Private Prostitute</p>
<p>Zhou Yu-ying, a woman from Changzhou, (21 years old, living at 6 Lèyú Li, Yunnan Road), whose clothing and jewelry were quite good. He hooked up with her and agreed on a price of four yuan for the night. Yu paid the prostitute's maid, who accompanied her, and she was sent back. He then went to the hotel with Zhou, by now it was late at night, about 12 AM. After a night of passion, at about 4 AM, the prostitute was exhausted and fell asleep. Yu got up and put the drug on a handkerchief and pressed it to the prostitute's nose. The prostitute immediately lost consciousness. Yu then took the prostitute's cheongsam, an overcoat, a pair of gold rings, and a pair of copper rings (with Zhou's name on them).</p>
<p>He Then Left</p>
<p>He also took the drugs with him. He then went to the Pacific Hotel at 430 Guangxi Road, changed his name to Ying Wen-da, and opened room 39 to stay. He divided the drugs into two small bottles. He pawned the prostitute's two pieces of clothing at the Fengtai Pawnshop on Jianwei Road for three yuan. He exchanged the remaining gold ring for one yuan and forty cents at the Lao Bincheng Silver Store at 175 Baier Road. In total, the amount he obtained was still short by one yuan and several cents. The prostitute, after being drugged, did not wake up until 12 noon the next day. In addition to having her clothing and jewelry stolen, her nose was also burned by the drug.</p>
<p>She Was Unable to Go Home</p>
<p>Because she had no clothes. She then called her family to have clothes sent to her so she could go home. Because of the nature of her profession, which violated the regulations, she dared not report to the police. It was not until 9 AM the day before yesterday that Hua Tanmu Lang Jintang and Bao Tan Xu Dezheng of the Lao Zha Police Station received a tip and arrested Yu in room 39 of the Pacific Hotel. They confiscated three bottles of drugs and brought them back to the police station for detention. They also recovered the stolen goods. They also summoned Zhou to the police station to identify that it was indeed the stolen goods, and that Yu was indeed</p>
<p>The Person Who Committed the Robbery</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the above situation and prosecuted him for robbery under Article 346 of the Criminal Law (punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment). He also said that after the incident, Yu divided the drugs into several bottles, perhaps with the intention of committing another crime, or had previously committed similar cases, which required further investigation, and asked for a postponement of the hearing. Following this, Zhou Yu-ying filed a report, proving the situation of the robbery. Yu Zhi-sheng confessed to all of the above, and said that the cause was that his desire for profit blinded him and that he took a risk. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and a new hearing scheduled in one week.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo to Expand; Adding a Whale Exhibition Hall, Elephant Enclosure, etc.; Construction to Begin Next Month and be Completed Within One Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road purchased a large whale from Chongming in February of this year. The specimen has been made and was originally scheduled to be publicly displayed in the park in April. However, due to the small size of the park, it could not be accommodated. A request has been submitted to the Education Bureau to reconstruct more than 20 houses next to the park, which is scheduled to begin construction early next month and be completed within one month. The details of each are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Whale Specimen Made. The park purchased a large whale from Hongmei Town, Chongming in February of this year. The whale was produced in the North Pacific and is rarely found in our country, making it extremely precious. The fish is more than 40 feet long, more than 10 feet in circumference, and weighs 12 tons. After being transported to Shanghai, the Oriental Instrument Company was entrusted to make two types of specimens: (1) a skeleton, and (2) an exterior shape. The specimens have already been made, but due to the small size of the park, there is no spare land, so they have not yet been displayed.</p>
<p>Expansion of Park Land Construction. The land of the zoo on Wenmiao Road only occupies four or five acres. Because of the collection and display of various animals, there is no spare land, so there is nowhere to display the whale specimens. A request was submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for instructions. The bureau then forwarded it to the Municipal Government for approval. About 20 houses in the southern part of the park will be reclaimed to build a whale exhibition hall, elephant enclosure, camel shed, tourist pavilion, etc. The construction is scheduled to begin early next month and be completed within one month.</p>
<p>Number of Visitors Increased Sharply This Month. As the spring is bright, the Dong wind is gentle, and the number of visitors to the park has increased sharply. According to the park's statistics, from the 1st of this month to the 23rd of this month, a total of 116,509 adults, 20,028 children, and 845 groups visited, totaling 137,382 people. The ticket price is still 6 copper coins per person, half price for children, and free admission for groups.</p>
<h3>Northern Spring Fish on the Market</h3>
<p>Northern Spring Fish (commonly known as Yellow Croaker) is produced in various places along the coast of the North Sea. The annual production is very large and it is transported and sold to various places in Songhu. The sales volume is quite amazing. In previous years, every time the Rainy Season Festival arrived, the fishing boats would depart from Songjiang to cast their nets. They could catch fish and return to Songjiang for sale in about ten days. This year, the fishing season started earlier. Yesterday morning, four leading boats arrived in Songjiang. According to Baofeng Fish Company, Xu Changli's boat caught two holds of fish, Shentai Fish Company received one boat from Xu Yongshun, and Cuisheng Fish Company received two boats from Yang Changshun and Zhang Fashun, each catching three or four holds of fish. The companies opened the scales for sale yesterday afternoon, and the price was 11 jins per ocean dollar. Because there were not many arrivals, they were quickly sold out, and there was a trend of supply falling short of demand. It is said that this year's fishing season may not be as prosperous as in previous years because there are not many fish. At present, the various rural gangs have not yet come to Songjiang to purchase, and they must wait for a large number of boats to arrive before they start selling.</p>
<h3>For the Sake of Two Copper Coins, an Elder Brother Stabs his Younger Brother to Death; All Three Wounds Were Fatal; Yang Zihun Truly Lost his Mind</h3>
<p>Yang Zihong, a native of Taixian County, has five brothers. Zihong is the eldest, the second is named Zitang, the third is Ziqi, the fourth is Zijun, and the fifth is Ziyi. The second and third brothers live in their native homes in poverty, while the fourth and fifth brothers both work as dockworkers in Pudong. The eldest brother (60 years old) lives with his family in the southern wharf of Peidong. He has no children or relatives to rely on, so even though he is in his sixties, he still works hard on the dock for food and shelter. The fourth and fifth brothers both live with their wives and daughters in a thatched shed next to the Pudong Avenue, south of the Kaiping Bureau. The afternoon before yesterday, after work, the fourth and fifth brothers caught fish and shrimp in the small river near the Kaiping Bureau and sold them in the market, earning only fifty copper coins. The two brothers should have each received half. However, because the fifth brother took two more copper coins, the fourth brother was dissatisfied and argued with his brother on the way home. The fifth brother refused to be outdone and</p>
<p>Argued Back with Each Other</p>
<p>"We are brothers, how can we value wealth over righteousness and be ridiculed by others?" The fourth brother's face flushed red and he became enraged. He took out a sharp blade and acted violently. The fifth brother was shocked and ran away frantically. The fourth brother refused to give up and chased after him. Not far from home, on the side of the Pudong Avenue, the fourth brother caught up with him, grabbed him and stabbed him. The fifth brother immediately fell to the ground and died, having been stabbed three times, once in the right temple, once in the right eye socket, and once at the base of the right ear. All were fatal wounds. At that time, the murderer was caught by the police, along with the murder weapon, and sent to the Yangjing District Police Station. Then, the murderer's wife was also arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, the police station ordered the fourteenth squad of the twenty-third bảo to report to the local court, requesting an autopsy. Soon after, the eldest brother of the deceased, Yang Zihong (whose right eye was disabled), filed a petition with the court, asking to waive the autopsy, stating briefly, "The rebellious son Zijun stabbed his younger brother Ziyi (41 years old) to death. I now wish to arrange for the coffin and burial myself. I also claim that the rebellious son Zijun is usually extremely violent. Six years ago, he blinded my right eye with a knife. I did not pursue the matter at the time out of brotherly affection. Last night, he argued with his younger brother over the money from selling fish and killed him. Therefore, I request that he be severely punished." After receiving the petition, Judge Ouyang Shu of the court interrogated the case and deemed that the murderer was like a fierce beast and extremely lawless, and that the request for waiving the autopsy was not approved. He immediately led Inspector Shen Qixiu to the scene to examine the body. It was verified that the deceased Yang Zixiang had been stabbed in the temple, ear root, and right eye (penetrating the brain), all of which were fatal wounds. It was determined that he died from the injuries, and a certificate was issued to the family for coffin and burial, pending the police station's delivery of the murderer Yang Zijun to the court for interrogation and legal handling.</p>
<h3>Relatives of the Victims of the Tongfu Shipwreck Detain the Ship Owner to File Charges; Due to Failure to Fulfill Outstanding Payments of Compensation; Fifteen Men and Women Detained Him at the Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, on November 2nd of last year, the Tongfu ship of the Tongan Company suddenly sank on Mupei Island in the Korean Sea, killing and injuring 56 crew members. The relatives of the dead and injured then formed a "Committee of Relatives of the Victims of the Tongfu Shipwreck" and appointed nine people, including Zhou Xinzhang from Ningbo, a representative of the crew's relatives residing at 5 Liangguanfang, Fangbang Bridge, Nanshi, to handle the matter. They negotiated with Bao Anshi, the ship owner of the company, to demand compensation. After several meetings between the two parties, on January 31st of this year, Bao Shunzheng, the authorized representative of Tongan Company, and Xinzhang, the representative of the Committee of Relatives of the Victims of the Tongfu Shipwreck, formally signed a settlement agreement, in which Tongan Company agreed to compensate the relatives of the dead and injured crew members with 17,950 yuan. After paying 9,800 yuan in the late winter and spring, no further payments have been made to date. Therefore, the relatives had previously detained the ship owner Bao Anfu and handed him over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the local court for handling. However, the court refused to accept the case because it concerned civil litigation and no formal complaint had been filed, so Bao was released. It has now been learned that the relatives of the shipwrecked crew members, including Zhou Xinzhang, Zheng Amin, Dai Changfa, and Miao Wangshi, Chuan Yuanshi, Yao Gaoshi, Yao Chaishi, Chen Zhangshi, Li Gushi, Gu Xushi, Huang Sunshi, Tang Geshi, Xin Xushi, Dai Heshi, Mei Jiangshi, and fifteen other men and women, met the ship owner Bao Anfu in Nanshi at around 12 o'clock the night before last, just as the legal proceedings were underway. They then detained Bao and sent him to the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that he be detained. They also reported to the party headquarters of the district and informed Director Li of the branch, who approved the handling of the matter.</p>
<h3>Deng Yanhui Commits Suicide Out of Worry About Poverty in Old Age; Who Can Know the Future; His Foolishness is Truly Unattainable</h3>
<p>Deng Yanhui, a native of Jiangxi, 37 years old, lived on the second floor of No. 28, Lane 412, Yulin Road. He was single and lived in Shanghai, making a living by carrying goods and selling silk stockings. Because he was extremely frugal, although his business was small, he had accumulated savings of dozens of yuan. However, recently he suddenly worried about the hardship of life when he became old and weak in the future, and the difficulty of a good outcome for his affairs after death. He became resentful and desperate, and recently developed the idea of ending his life. He secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Zhou Keyu, the second landlord of the house, and others discovered this and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. Deputy Inspector Yang Peisheng was dispatched to investigate. He sent him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The inspector searched his room and found two opium boxes and a small amount of leftover opium. He also found banknotes and notes totaling 31.5 yuan, small coins totaling 172 jiao, and 14,400 wen in copper coins. There was also a suicide note addressed to his friend Zhou Daoxiang, which stated, "Dear brother Daoxiang, you are aware of my situation. Although I am young and strong now, and my life is still warm and fulfilling, what will I do when I get old and have illnesses? I will not be able to go out to work, and no one will take care of me. Life will be difficult, and there will be no good outcome after death, which is why I have come to this desperate measure. Please arrange for my funeral with Mr. Zhou (i.e., the second landlord Zhou Keyu) with my meager savings." The inspector then moved the body to the Feilun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and a court clerk, etc., went to the mortuary to examine the body. According to Zhou Keyu's statement, he is 46 years old, a native of Ningbo, and works as a postman. I am the second landlord of this house. The deceased came last year around the ninth lunar month to live in my second-floor room. He usually went out at about 8 o'clock every morning and returned at 9 o'clock in the evening, selling silk stockings, and this was his daily routine. Recently, for the past two days, he had not been seen going in and out, so at about 9 o'clock yesterday morning, my wife went to his room to see what was going on. Suddenly, she saw that the door was tightly closed. She pushed it but could not open it, and called out but received no response. Then she saw him lying on the bed through a gap in the door, his face pale. Only then did she realize something was wrong, and I reported it to the police." Zhou Daoxiang, a native of Anhui, 31 years old, residing at 169 Lane 6, Badatou, and a peddler, stated that the deceased was his friend and that he only had a cousin in his hometown. Since he is now dead, he is willing to do his best with Mr. Zhou to arrange his affairs after death. After receiving the statements, Mr. Guo declared that the examination showed that the deceased Deng Yanhui had indeed committed suicide by taking opium, and the body was handed over to his friend Zhou Keyu for burial after signing a guarantee. The deceased's money was allowed to be issued to Zhou Keyu in court after signing a receipt.</p>
<h3>Contracting Two Railway Car Catering and Tea Services: Lawyer Accused of Fraud; Lawyer Bo Hongxun Released on Bail of 5,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Jiang Youtang, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 21, Jingde Lane, Baoyou Road, Zhabei, aged 43 this year, was introduced by his friend Zhang Guansheng around April of last year. He then contacted Bo Hongxun (courtesy name Nanfang), a native of Gaoyou currently residing at No. 20, Daode Lane, Beile Road in the French Concession (aged 34 this year, joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association in the 19th year of the Republic, practicing as a lawyer), and others to discuss contracting the dining car, tea room, and hawking services on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. Zhang told Jiang that after the matter was settled, a "lobbying fee" of 33,000 yuan would be required. Tang Pinxing, a friend of Zhang, joined as a shareholder. However, Jiang, lacking the personal financial resources, sought cooperation from Yin Dong. Feng Yishen, a local resident residing at No. 9, Yongxiang Lane, Avenue Edward VII, and Wang Gengyi, a native of Hubei from the Ping An Society on Zhu Bao San Road, were acquainted with Jiang. After Jiang's persuasion, both readily agreed to invest. By July, Tang Pinxing declared to Jiang that he was withdrawing his shares due to other commitments. Subsequently, Jiang Youtang, Zhang Guansheng, and Bo Hongxun discussed the matter, drafting several petitions and paying Lawyer Bo a petition filing fee of 400 yuan, for which Bo issued a receipt. On August 1st, Bo and others falsely told Jiang that the matter had been approved by Railway Bureau Director Huang Boqiao and that they could take over the operations soon, but that an entertainment fee of 1,000 yuan was required first. Three days later, Jiang obtained 600 yuan in shares from Feng Yishen and 400 yuan from Wang, totaling 1,000 yuan, which he handed over to Bo, who also personally wrote a receipt. Months passed, and Jiang, hearing nothing, inquired with Bo and others, who made excuses and delayed. Therefore, he went directly to the Railway Administration to inquire about the truth. The bureau replied that matters regarding the railway dining cars and tea rooms were always publicly tendered, and that no one was authorized to negotiate privately, considering Bo and others' actions as bordering on deceptive swindling, which damaged the railway bureau's reputation. They immediately reported to Bureau Director Huang Boqiao, who forwarded a letter to the French Concession police for thorough investigation. Jin Jiulin, the inspector general of the special agency of the French Concession police, along with detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Bao Tan Yin Shike, detained Lawyer Bo Hongxun on the afternoon before last. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Dong Qichang interrogated him. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that the defendant had committed the crime of defrauding for property and requested that he be tried according to the law. Then, the plaintiff, Jiang Youtang, recounted the experience of being swindled and invited Lawyer Lang Peng to the court, filing an incidental private lawsuit. When questioned, the defendant Bo Hongxun stated that Zhang Guansheng wanted to handle the tea room and dining car affairs of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and originally asked Chen Dingzhong to find a way, having paid Chen 400 yuan for entertaining. Later, Chen went to Jiangxi due to other commitments, and Chen and Zhang entrusted Hongxun and Xu Guangfu to handle it. The petition to the Railway Bureau was in the name of Tang Pinxing but used Jiang Youtang's photo. Later, a reply was received, pointing out that the person in the photo did not match the petitioner, so they were entrusted to find another way. The judge asked if the 1,000 yuan miscellaneous expense paid by the plaintiffs was received and used by him. He replied that the money was given to Xu Guangfu by the plaintiffs, and Zhang Guansheng asked him to write the receipt on his behalf. He was also asked about another receipt for 400 yuan, and whether he received the money. He replied that the money was to repay Chen Dingzhong's debt, and another receipt was for a debt Jiang Youtang owed Ping Zhichu. Ping entrusted him to handle the lawsuit. Later, they settled out of court. The receipt he issued was given to Ping Zhichu. Although he helped handle this matter, he did not receive a single penny. The plaintiff, Jiang Youtang, also claimed that the merchants issued two promissory notes for "lobbying fees" totaling 11,000 yuan each, adding up to 33,000 yuan, which were given to Lawyer Bo for safekeeping. At the time, Bo stated that he feared that after the matter succeeded, he would deny this sum, and this note could be used as evidence to sue him in court. Now that the matter had failed, he requested the return of these three promissory notes. When questioned, Bo denied having these notes. After verifying the statements in court, the hearing was adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 27th for further questioning of witnesses. The defendant, Bo Hongxun, was ordered to provide a cash bail of 5,000 yuan to ensure he would be available when summoned, or be detained without bail.</p>

The mobile kitchen has five units and was created by Commander Gleean. If the trial proves successful, the problem of meals during the mobilization of the Volunteer Corps in the future can be solved.</p>
<p>Because the area in front of the Shanghai Club on Avenue Edward VII is limited, the Municipal Council has only prepared three special guest seating areas. The first, the J section, is for members and their spouses of the Police Committee. The second, the K section, is for members and their spouses of consulates, organizations, and foreign military officers and civilian officials. The third, the L section, is for national officials and their spouses, and other invited guests. All the above guests are expected to arrive before 3:15 PM because Jing'an Temple Road must stop traffic immediately after the troops depart. The British military band will play during the procession.</p>

<h3>Chaohu Boat Badly Damaged in Collision; Steamer Flees at Full Speed; Wife and Six Friends Missing</h3>
<p>Ge Jingxin, a boatman from Chaohu, recently loaded 2,500 bags of flour purchased by merchants from Tai &amp; Co. in Shanghai, transported them to Tai &amp; Co. for unloading, and then returned. He was hired by a Shanghai flour mill to load 1,800 bags of wheat in Jiangbei and transport them to Shanghai for unloading. After loading the cargo, Ge's boat set sail. The day before yesterday, it was sailing on the Donghai sea off Haimen when the wind changed, so it anchored at the mouth of the Donghai. The next morning, it was about to sail when a fog suddenly arose, preventing it from sailing. Around noon, seeing that the fog had not cleared, Ge instructed his crew to sail along the coast so as to reach Shanghai as soon as possible. While the crew was having lunch in the stern cabin, they suddenly saw a steamer approaching from the front. Ge thought that the boat was anchored on the coast and would not be an obstacle, so he did not take precautions. Unexpectedly, the steamer sailed straight ahead and approached the coast. Seeing this, Ge rang the gong to make the steamer hear the sound and change course to avoid them. The steamer ignored it and continued straight ahead. Wen, etc. shouted when they saw it. Unexpectedly, the bow of the steamer violently collided with the middle of Wen's boat. The boat was hit onto the beach by the sea and overturned and broke into pieces. All the crew members fell into the water. The steamer, seeing that it had caused the accident, turned around and sped eastward at full speed. Fortunately, a Haimen steamer and a pig boat passed by and, seeing the situation, sailed forward to rescue Ge and 16 others, transporting them to the coast of Donghai. He then hired a boat to go to the scene of the accident to inspect. The boat was broken and flooded, and many utensils and goods were washed away. Yesterday, Ge took a steamer to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai Flour Mill. It is said that those currently missing include his wife and children, one each, and a total of six crew members. It is not known whether they have been rescued. The factory has instructed Ge to investigate the name of the steamer so as to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Giving Away a Concubine, Scheming a "Honeypot Trap," Shi Feng Defeated Beyond Endurance: The Terrifying Ways of Friends</h3>
<p>Hua Fulin, a Jiangbei native who runs a boat business, is about 20 years old. Two months ago, he became involved with Jiang Abao, a 19-year-old woman from the same hometown, living at No. 15, Damuqiao Road, Xietu Road, Shanghai South, and together rented Room No. 6 of the Zhu Shunxing Inn at No. 379, Dong Zilaihuo Street, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, as a temporary residence. Hua had a close friend in the same industry, Yao Jinhai from Jiading, who was 20 years old. Yao often went to Hua's room in the Zhu Shunxing Inn to chat and play, so he became acquainted with Jiang Abao. At 8:00 AM on the 21st of this month, Yao went to Hua's place again to chat. Hua told Yao that he was unable to support his concubine Abao and that if Yao was interested, he might as well give her away. At first, Yao thought Hua was joking and did not commit. That evening, Hua and Yao met again at a friend's banquet. After the banquet, around 9:00 PM, Hua brought up the previous conversation again and instructed Yao to go to the Zhu Shunxing Inn and take Abao out to rent another room. At this point, Yao deeply believed that Hua truly intended to give the concubine away. He went straight to the Zhu Shunxing Inn, called the woman out, and at 11:30 PM that night, went together to the Chunji Inn on Taiping Bridge Caishi Road and rented Room No. 11, preparing for sexual intercourse. What he didn't know was that Hua and Abao had already agreed in advance, so they gathered three ruffians and secretly followed behind. After Abao and Yao rented Room No. 11 in the Chunji Inn, they went out three times in half an hour. Hua then rushed into the Chunji Inn with the ruffians, first pretending to knock on the door of Room No. 19. Since the room was empty, they shouted loudly for the waiter Chen Caisheng to [illegible] Room No. 11 [illegible]. At this time, Yao heard Hua's voice in Room No. 11. Thinking he had done nothing wrong and that Hua had asked him to call Abao to rent the room, he did not suspect a trap and invited Hua into the room to sit for a while. Hua and others entered the room and immediately accused Yao of raping the concubine, shouting loudly and being unreasonable, wanting to take Yao to the Zhu Shunxing Inn for negotiations. Yao knew he had fallen into a trap and, thinking he was alone and helpless, dared not go out with them rashly. Jiang Abao then patted her chest and assured Yao that everything would be said on her behalf. Yao, being forced, had no choice but to go to Hua's usual Room No. 6 in the Zhu Shunxing Inn. Hua then restricted Yao's freedom of movement and extorted 100 yuan, or else he would be killed immediately. Yao had no money at the time. Zhang Xiaoqing, a boatman from Chongming who lived in Room No. 7 next door and was also an accomplice of Hua, came forward to mediate, ordering Yao to pay 40 yuan to settle the matter and have Zhang and others act as guarantors to ensure payment. After both parties agreed, Yao wrote a promissory note, which Hua took, and was then allowed to leave. Unexpectedly, the next morning, Hua went back on his word and forced Yao to pay the money. At this point, Yao believed that Hua had deliberately set up a "honeypot trap" to extort money and was unwilling to accept it. He reported to the French Concession police and requested that they arrest and investigate the case. The police agreed and immediately sent detective Xu Jinlong to the Zhu Shunxing Inn to make an arrest. Hua Fulin and Zhang Xiaoqing had already fled after hearing the news. Only the woman Jiang Abao, i.e. Hua Jiang's wife, and Zhang Cen's wife were arrested and detained. After a thorough investigation, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, presented the case, charging them with crimes such as obstruction of freedom and fraud. The detective then reported the investigation of the case, and the plaintiff Yao Jinhai also recounted the previous events. Judge Chong Qichang questioned Jiang and Zhang Cen about the events. After debate, he announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 27th. Hua Jiang was returned to custody, and Zhang Cen was released on bail pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>The Blessing of Hemorrhoid Sufferers</h3>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Department of the Swiss New Ruikang Foreign Firm, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road in this city, has long been praised by major doctors for managing Hua Fu Malt Extract Nutritional Products, which is recognized as a necessary nourishing and conditioning holy product in the family.

Its ingredients are completely different from those popular on the market. It only contains sufficient E. coli antitoxin, which is the only cause of hemorrhoids. This is a new discovery in the medical field in recent years. The ingredients of various hemorrhoid medicines in the past were limited to hemostasis and laxative effects, which only took effect temporarily. Therefore, if patients use it once, it will immediately stop bleeding and relieve pain, and the hemorrhoids can also shrink and even disappear. If you continue to use it for three weeks, it will never recur, allowing patients to completely escape from the sea of ​​suffering. The usage is simple and painless, and the price is low. Each tube can be used more than 20 times, which is affordable for the middle and lower classes. Moreover, it can avoid the trouble of using hand guards. It is truly a lucky star for hemorrhoid patients and deserves to be the best medicine for this disease. Patients with hemorrhoids should try it.</p>

<p>Gong Stage Holds Japanese Drama Sports Week People in Shanghai have a habit of watching night dramas and not liking to watch daytime dramas. The stage also speculates on the psychology of people in society and often perfunctorily and sloppily handles daytime dramas, not seeking to be exquisite, while concentrating on the night dramas. Therefore, even if it is the same drama, there is a clear difference. The owner of Gong Stage plans to correct this problem, so he held a Japanese Drama Sports Week to arouse the interest of people in society in watching Japanese dramas. From Wednesday of this week to Wednesday of next week, the seat prices will be specially reduced. The original price of the special seat is eight jiao, which is reduced to five jiao, and the highest price of the upstairs seat is reduced by four jiao. In addition to the drama price, there are no other fees. If two people watch together, they can get joint seats and only charge one yuan. The performance is serious, the scenery is beautiful, and it is no different from the night drama. This is really good news for the drama industry.</p>

<p>Lu Wu Hall Officially Opens to Mark the Grand Occasion The Jue Lu Dance Hall officially opened yesterday.

One of the three major singers, Ms. Wang Manjie, as well as Rong Xiaoyi, Rong Yuyi, sister flowers, and other celebrities such as Long Lizhu and Zhao [blank] Zhen, accompanied and sang popular dance tunes and the latest dance programs, which were quite wonderful. Therefore, guests were crowded last night, with no room to insert a foot, so that those who came later could only sigh in vain at the door and labor in vain. For a time, there was a lot of traffic, which can be called an unprecedented grand occasion. It is said that tea and refreshments and various novel performances will continue to be given away tonight, and balloons will be released to entertain guests.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Nailing)</p>
<p>Love is beautiful, poetic, and sweet, which is probably a fact that everyone recognizes. A foreign poet once said such a sentence: "Love is supreme;" but unexpectedly, the most common phenomenon of love now is bloodshed: there are too many things that lead to bloodshed because of love, and now I only refer to the most sensational recent one, such as the Liu Jinggui case in Beiping.</p>
<p>Someone once said: Love with curves is the most delicious, and it is best to have triangular, quadrilateral, and pentagonal love! Love is too ordinary, like drinking a glass of boiled water. Someone else said; It is a very noble thing to sacrifice for love! But I say: It is the most meaningless thing in the world to tumble in triangular, quadrilateral, and pentagonal love with a lot of useful time and energy: As for sacrificing for love, that is even more of a bad luck person! If you don’t believe it, just think, isn’t Teng Shuang unlucky to die?</p>
<h3>Caryota Urens</h3>
<p>— Great Guangdong</p>
<p>“Caryota Urens, one heart." All the Guangdong people know these two common words. What exactly is Caryota urens? Not only the Jiangsu people have never seen it, but also the Guangdong people hardly see it. Only there is one Caryota urens tree in the Three Yuan Temple of Guanyin Mountain in the provincial capital, which grows next to the stone steps of the Three Yuan Temple. It is an evergreen tree with a straight trunk that goes straight up without any bend. It grows a large umbrella-shaped canopy of leaves until the top, without a single branch on the side. This is the saying "one heart." When I saw it, the trunk was already five or six feet high and at least four feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Although its – the lower half of the Caryota urens tree is bare without branches and leaves, the colorful "pant belts" are tied around the circumference of the trunk, and there are piles of incense and candles at the base of the tree, which are all young women in their boudoirs. Because their “black lacquer stool” has an affair, so after sleeping on the "black lacquer stool," they secretly changed his pant belt and ran quietly to tie it on him, so his heart, like its heart, is a “one heart” single-mindedly in love with her, and there will be no more affairs. This kind of legend is of course a bit superstitious, but it has long been spread throughout Yangcheng and has been passed down to this day.</p>
<h3>Tomb Sweeping</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the deceased stepmother and father, I always have to return to my hometown every year to sweep the tomb. Although the dead may not come to appreciate our filial piety, we are still doing our best as sons.</p>
<p>Returning to my hometown, I spent a few days busy visiting relatives, while my mother was busy preparing all the dishes and ingot foil used for the tomb sweeping.</p>
<p>I only return to my hometown once a year, and the days are very short, so my time in my hometown is very precious. Although a year does not seem very long, it cannot be said to be very close. So when I return every time, those friends and relatives seem very kind, but in this kindness, I feel a lot of unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>Qingming Day is the day for tomb sweeping; we arranged a table of wine and dishes, and asked a few villagers to carry them to the mountain in a ten-lo drum—a striped box for storing dishes. I remember today last year, there were six of us sweeping the tomb: mother, sister, me, brother, wife and child, but this year there are only five of us! Because my sister passed away on March 8th this year! Walking silently together, I could no longer see my sister, and two lines of hot tears flowed down like a fountain. This time I came back, not only to sweep the tomb, but also to call for "Five Seven" for my sister. Walking up the mountain, I saw a new tomb next to the tombs of my grandmother, father, and brother. Seeing this striking new tomb, I couldn't help but lie on the tomb and cry out loud.</p>
<p>The wine and dishes are placed on the offering table, and the cups and chopsticks are neatly arranged. But where can I see them enjoying this rich sacrifice! Only a pile of paper ingots has been burned into ashes. Everyone swept the tomb, and everyone was silent and sad. The tragic mood devastated my heart, which had been wounded several times, making it more painful than a snake bite!</p>
<p>Cry, cry! But I can't cry anymore: when did my tears run dry?</p>
<p>Hanging my head, I knelt silently in front of the tomb, let my soul be destroyed in this sad atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Coveted</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Small West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve Ashamed of Having No Clothes, Hiding Behind the Curtain to Avoid Guests, Diligently Saving Candlelight to Copy Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian went to great lengths for Yueying's matter, and actually borrowed a few pieces of women's clothes and pants from the account room and brought them over. Behind him followed Yang Huanhua, Hu's wife, and Zhou Yourong, the county magistrate who had come to the province after resigning from his post. Therefore, the footsteps and voices were very chaotic. Zhiqian laughed; Beihai, do you know that there is someone hidden inside the account? Beihai smiled; I know. I am here to guard the guest because there is someone inside, for fear that it will cause misunderstanding when Mr. Cheng comes with a guest. Cheng Zhiqian nodded with a smile and said, your meaning is not bad. Saying that he handed the package of clothes clipped under his arm to Hu's wife, and said; you can give these clothes to him to wear. Hu's wife walked to the front of the bed with the clothes in her hands. When she raised her hand, she wanted to lift the account, but Yueying saw that there were these people in the house, how could she allow him to do this, she rolled on the bed and shouted strangely. Yang Huanhua laughed; People are girls from the West, and they value old morals very much. To teach him to change clothes in the room in front of many people, of course, he is unwilling. Zhiqian said: There is also the account, what's the point. Yang Huanhua said; It is very clear to look from the account to the outside of the account. He thought that the outside to the inside was also like this, so he was unwilling to change. Zhiqian said: Now the rain has stopped, we three men can get away to one side. Zhou Yourong said: Then go to my room to sit down. This little Wang brother is really hardworking. Even on such a rainy day, he still comes to tutor as usual, so don't delay his studies. Take the books and go to my place to tutor together. I will also find a newspaper to read, which will definitely not interfere with your affairs. (190)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This sentence seems very strange. According to us, how can a pair of shoes with so many pearls nailed on them and only connected by a very thin silk thread not break or fall off? But as long as we think of the person who uses these phoenix shoes with pearls nailed on them, it is an old empress dowager, we will believe that this is very possible! Not only is it possible, it is even inevitable! Because there are hundreds of pairs of phoenix shoes stored in the "shoe vault," and new ones are being added continuously, each pair of shoes has at most one or two chances to be worn by the empress dowager, or even none at all; the so-called one time is very short, half a day or a few hours at the least, one or two days at the most, and there is never a case of wearing them for three or four days in a row. Even when wearing them on the empress dowager's feet, she spends more time quietly and less time moving; even if she moves, her steps are very light and slow, and there is never any violent vibration, so no matter how many pearls are nailed on, no matter how weak they are, they will never roll down! If they were very easy to roll off, then the eunuchs who sweep the floor in the palace would all be able to open pearl shops! This is not nonsense, because the phoenix shoes of the empress dowager often have three or four hundred pearls nailed on the most, twenty or thirty on the least, and usually seventy or eighty or so; with so many pearls, as long as one-tenth of them fall off, wouldn't it be very considerable?</p>
<p>If you ask how there are so many pearls in the palace for the empress dowager to use so lavishly, of course, they were all tributes from the capital and local governments, as well as vassal states such as Goryeo and Annam. (300)</p>
<h3>Villages and Towns</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>I occasionally go to the villages and towns in the interior for inspections, and I obtained the following statistics:</p>
<p>Teahouses: occupy six-tenths; shops, occupy two-tenths; residences, occupy two-tenths.</p>
<p>Judging from this, teahouses are very developed in the villages and towns of the interior. However, on the other hand, it fully symbolizes that farmers in the Chinese interior do not have proper leisure activities, which has led to the phenomenon that teahouses account for the absolute majority in every village and town.</p>
<p>Every day, every month, every year, the business of these teahouses is always very prosperous. Some people use them as places to discuss village affairs, some use them as places for gambling and entertainment, and even more people simply sit there for two or three hours out of boredom because they have no way to spend their spare time. It is a common and unsurprising fact that our Chinese compatriots do not cherish time.</p>
<p>What makes me feel the urgent need for improvement is the popular custom of singing local operas in the villages and towns of the interior at night. The content is mostly obscene and unbearable. However, it is precisely these obscene things that deeply grip the minds of many villagers. When the stars begin to shine in the sky, they flock to listen to the operas, men and women alike. Oh heavens, it's truly pitiful! After listening to these obscene so-called operas, their hearts are greatly agitated, and then cases of men and women eloping occur frequently in the villages and towns of the interior. What a dangerous phenomenon this is!</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the villages and towns in the interior truly need thorough improvement. I sincerely hope that those responsible for governing the peace will rise up and pay attention to this problem that is becoming serious!</p>
<p>Travelogue</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting Old Places in Moling</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>I finally got a few days of spring vacation, and it just so happened that Shi and Zhang invited me to go to Nanjing. Firstly, I could visit old friends, and secondly, I could see the new constructions. Having been buried in work all year round, I also got this opportunity to change the air, so I agreed to go with them. On the day we set off, it was still drizzling in the morning, but it had cleared up by the time we left the city. After boarding the train, I saw the spring scenery of the fields unfolding from the train window, and I didn't feel the journey was long. After passing Zhenjiang, I met two acquaintances, Zhang and Hu Cheng. Chatting and talking, we arrived at Xiaguan in no time. Zhang invited us to a restaurant on Baixia Road for a banquet, which was very appreciated! That night, we stayed at the Dacheng Hotel.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to visit friends in the north of the city early in the morning. Chen, Wu, and Sun all lived in Jiuhua Village. The village is near Central University, connected to the agricultural fields, half village and half suburb, as if in another quiet realm. The residences are all newly built houses, facing each other in an orderly manner, making it very convenient to visit. There are yards in front of the houses, where some flowers and trees are planted. In Wu's garden, the broad bean flowers were blooming vigorously, with a great mountain village flavor. The host cooked and provided meals, cleared the bed to stay overnight, so kind that it was hard to bear.</p>
<p>On the day of our return, we went to our alma mater, Central University, and toured around for a week. All the constructions are very different from before. The grandeur of the assembly hall, the expansion of the library, the atmosphere is all new. Even a corner of the Mei Nunnery has been rebuilt into a new house, with a stone tablet commemorating the two martyrs Cheng and Wu next to it. Only the six ancient pines are still green and strong, contrasting with the old and decadent Southern High School, which is both touching and evocative! After leaving the school, we went to Jiming Temple for a tour and overlooking. This was a place we often visited during our student days. The scenery at Huomeng Tower is still the same, and sitting and looking at the back lake is like a natural picture scroll. It was not until the evening prayer of the monks and the slow ringing of the mountain bells that we went down the mountain, exited Heping Gate, took the evening train back, and hastily wrote a poem of forty rhymes to record my momentary joy!</p>
<p>The rain stops, welcoming the new clearing,</p>
<p>Driving out of the city together in the car,</p>
<p>Rare to have spare time,</p>
<p>To travel to Moling again.</p>
<p>The whistle sounds,</p>
<p>Happily boarding the journey.</p>
<p>The spring scenery is good,</p>
<p>The scenery outside the window is bright.</p>
<p>The distant shadow of the Tiger Hill Pagoda,</p>
<p>The misty colors of Xishan are clear.</p>
<p>In a blink, Jingjiao passes,</p>
<p>The great river is seen in the distance.</p>
<p>Old friends meet by chance,</p>
<p>Kneeling and talking about life.</p>
<p>At dusk, the carriage is unloaded,</p>
<p>The lights illuminate the crystal Ying.</p>
<p>Going to the edge of Baixia Road,</p>
<p>A joyful banquet with wine-filled cups,</p>
<p>The kind host,</p>
<p>Endless Taotan feelings.</p>
<p>The next morning, visiting old friends,</p>
<p>Winding roads are not smooth.</p>
<p>Jiuhua Village is more beautiful,</p>
<p>A new pool of water.</p>
<p>Leisurely away from the mundane,</p>
<p>Hearing the orioles singing in the willow shade,</p>
<p>There is another world,</p>
<p>Half reading and half farming.</p>
<p>How exquisite is the building,</p>
<p>Facing each other, looking at the balance.</p>
<p>The yard is full of interest,</p>
<p>Gourd rack and bean shed.</p>
<p>Entering the room, the spring atmosphere is abundant,</p>
<p>The host welcomes with a smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly meeting after a long separation,</p>
<p>Joy turns to surprise.</p>
<p>Clearing the bed to stay temporarily,</p>
<p>Preparing a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Cutting candles under the west window,</p>
<p>Talking about the old days until late at night.</p>
<p>The three families come and go from time to time,</p>
<p>Close as brothers.</p>
<p>Passing on the torch overseas early,</p>
<p>Each has achieved a wealth of learning.</p>
<p>Holding the bell through the north and south,</p>
<p>Happily nurturing the elite.</p>
<p>Closing the door to write diligently,</p>
<p>Fine spirit bears a great name.</p>
<p>Relying on teaching and politics for consultation,</p>
<p>Excellent and with good reviews.</p>
<p>Books and paintings are both loved,</p>
<p>A dazzling array fills the four walls.</p>
<p>Appreciating exquisite porcelain tiles,</p>
<p>Rare treasures lined up in bottles.</p>
<p>Lofty ideals correct worldly habits,</p>
<p>Wealth and honor are light as fleeting clouds.</p>
<p>Deep friendship becomes more joyful over time,</p>
<p>Strong as a sworn alliance in the cold winter.</p>
<p>We are few classmates,</p>
<p>Meeting makes the heart more inclined.</p>
<p>The land north of the city is clear and open,</p>
<p>The magnificent learning expenses are seen.</p>
<p>The place where strings and chants were heard in the past,</p>
<p>The atmosphere is even more magnificent now.</p>
<p>Revisiting to find old traces,</p>
<p>The road is confusing, almost blind.</p>
<p>The wide building is beautiful,</p>
<p>Twenty years of painstaking management.</p>
<p>Mei Nunnery has changed several times,</p>
<p>The pine trunk is old and more prosperous.</p>
<p>Martyrs leave a memorial,</p>
<p>The tablet titles Cheng and Wu together.</p>
<p>Climbing the mountain, the waist and feet are strong,</p>
<p>Visiting the ancient Jiming Temple.</p>
<p>Pointing out the road to Taicheng,</p>
<p>Sentries are stationed as a precaution.</p>
<p>Huomeng Tower is as before,</p>
<p>Sitting and listening to the evening bell.</p>
<p>Returning to write a long sentence,</p>
<p>Throwing the pen, the meaning lingers!</p>

<h3>New Director Lei Zhen of the Academic Work Consultation Office Has Taken Office</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenji, the director of the National Academic Work Consultation Office, has been working diligently and tirelessly since he took office last October. After more than six months, the scale is complete, and the achievements are brilliant. However, his mental and physical strength has been excessively exhausted. He fell slightly ill for a few weeks last month, but he still insisted on working for the public, which triggered his old illness and made him feel more overwhelmed. He repeatedly submitted his resignation, but the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Education did not approve it because they relied on him so much. Recently, he was urged to take a quiet rest, so his determination to leave became stronger. He submitted his resignation again the day before yesterday. The commission and the Ministry of Education reluctantly approved it because it was difficult to force him to stay and appointed Lei Zhen, the director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, to concurrently serve as the director of the office. It is found that Mr. Lei has a historical relationship with the establishment of the office, and he is currently a member of the qualification review committee of the office, and his support is particularly enthusiastic. It can be said that he is the right person to serve as the director of the office. It is heard that Mr. Lei took office at the office at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 23rd) and was introduced to all the staff one by one by the former director Cheng, and gave instructions. Then, Mr. Lei gave a speech, praising the past facilities of the office, and instructed all the staff to continue to serve with peace of mind. The internal organization and the original planned plans will not be changed, etc. Mr. Cheng has handed over everything clearly on the same day and took a car to Hangzhou for recuperation.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhouruo Speaks on Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Labor Union invited political commentator Zhang Zhouruo to give a lecture in the hall of the bureau yesterday. Hundreds of employees of the bureau attended. The topic was "The Disappearance and Cultivation of National Strength." He briefly stated that human beings are governed by the principle of survival of the fittest. The survival and prosperity of any nation is based on the strength or weakness of its strength. The components of national strength, as expressed in the group, are defense, productivity, and organizational strength. The accumulation in the individual is the development of the intelligence, morality, and physical superiority of each individual in the country. The former is only the result of the latter, and the latter is the source of the former. Therefore, if we want to revive the nation and develop national strength, we must first rely on the self-reliance of every citizen. Therefore, Zhang especially advocated self-reliance. In the past, various patriotic movements did not understand the relationship between group strength and individual strength, and only focused on the pursuit of the external form of strength, without paying attention to the cultivation of the source of strength. Therefore, the people still do not know how to strive for self-improvement, and the nation has not been able to revive. In the future, the basic work of saving the country should start with the self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-reliance of every citizen. The result of the joint efforts of men, women, young and old, scholars, farmers, workers, and businessmen across the country can naturally create a strong and powerful national force. He also quoted the words of sages and heroes from ancient and modern China and foreign countries to prove that the self-reliance he created is indeed the driving force for promoting society and reviving the nation.</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>The Raising of Ten Thousand Hands Has an Incredible Effect</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>These days, the silver issue is tense again. What are others doing? I won't bother with that, and I have no power to stop it. In a word, we must rely on ourselves and the united determination of the people of the whole country to carry out the work of self-rescue. A certain economist put it well: To save the outflow of silver by simply negotiating with the Washington government is unlikely to work, as this is their national policy. Even implementing a balancing tax may not be effective, because foreigners use the concession relationship and establish many banks in China. Even if they purchase silver, they don't directly ship it out, so the effect is the same. Moreover, with tens of millions of imports exceeding exports every year, silver will ultimately flow out. The only way for Chinese people to cope in the future is to grit their teeth and refuse to use foreign goods. The United States is a country that encourages exports to China. If that loses its effect, they may change their plans suddenly. This is a penetrating view, and I strongly agree with it. Today, when seeking help from others is not as good as relying on ourselves, we can only endure this (be more determined to consistently use domestic goods). On April 18th, I personally participated in the citywide student oath ceremony to use domestic goods and witnessed ten thousand hands raised high, shouting in unison the oath "I swear with utmost sincerity to start with myself, and to persuade and guide my family and the entire society to use domestic goods." If these ten thousand people persuade ten people each day, we can reach one hundred thousand people in a day, and within a month, all Shanghai citizens can be generally persuaded to use domestic goods. This incredible effect can only be achieved if everyone implements it consistently.</p>
<h3>After We Have Taken the Oath</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>We must be even more courageous in practical action</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. Just a week ago today, many of us students were standing in the crowded crowds, eagerly voicing the oath to use domestic goods from now on. Of course, from now on, everyone must be down-to-earth, do their best, practice what they preach, and open a ray of dawn for the future of national products through practical efforts, saving our country's economy from the brink of collapse. However, the reality is definitely not that simple. Past experiences have told us that merely shouting slogans is useless. There must be concrete plans and orderly implementation to be effective. Therefore, at this time, I have an eager hope that after taking this oath, students across the country will be even more courageous in practical action, with an organized and planned approach, so that every student can exert their enthusiasm for loving and using domestic goods. I think that this year's results will definitely be more satisfactory than in the past.</p>
<p>However, here, I must also earnestly hope that the teachers in each school, who bear the responsibility of guiding students, must lead the general student body in practicing the tasks and missions in the oath during this effort to educate about domestic goods. First of all, starting from the schools themselves, create a model and example of using domestic goods, to guide the students' families and guide the entire society. As for how to start implementation, I dare to offer three foolish opinions for teachers and students across the country to adopt and implement:</p>
<p>First, in the school's administration, from today onwards, the principle of using domestic goods should be adopted uniformly. Regardless of clothing, stationery, instruments, equipment, and all miscellaneous appliances, the use of foreign goods must be absolutely prohibited. A committee for using domestic goods should be jointly organized by teachers and students, and regulations for rewarding the purchase and use of domestic goods should be promulgated. If there is any violation, both parties must be subject to appropriate penalties.</p>
<p>Second, in the school's teaching materials, the words and deeds biographies and success stories of various domestic goods pioneers and industrial inventors should be selected for reading, and various periodicals on domestic goods should be read regularly and more articles on domestic goods should be researched for further study.</p>
<p>Third, in the school's extracurricular work, it is advisable to often visit various domestic goods factories and domestic goods companies for on-site visits, and hold a domestic goods lecture once a week, inviting famous domestic goods figures to speak, and using Sundays, students and teachers should form domestic goods propaganda groups and parent-teacher conferences, performing or giving speeches to promote the importance of domestic goods, so as to achieve the task of persuading families and persuading the entire society to use domestic goods uniformly.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to ask all the students in the country to remember firmly that our oath that day was: "I swear with utmost sincerity to start with myself, and to persuade and guide my family and the entire society to use domestic goods uniformly. If there are domestic goods available that I do not use, I am willing to be severely punished by the people of the country!"</p>
<h3>Hangzhou's National Goods Market</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>During the spring break, I strolled around Hangzhou for a week, enjoying the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains. By the way, I also visited two national goods markets. After the visit, I had some feelings, so I wrote this article.</p>
<p>(1) National Goods Company This company is located near the lakeside, facing Hangzhou's main road, in a two-story building similar to a gallery. There are more than a dozen shops facing the road. Entering the gate, there is a large courtyard, and there are dozens of shops upstairs and downstairs. It seems that the company's shops are rented out to others to operate, so each shop still uses its own shop name. Among the things sold inside, Hangzhou local products account for 70 to 80 percent, as if it is specially opened for people from other places traveling to Hangzhou. Inside, there is a silk and satin shop that specializes in Hangzhou silk and Hangzhou spinning, a tea shop, a scissors shop, a fan shop, and a variety of miscellaneous goods shops that specialize in selling Tianzhu chopsticks, lotus root powder, prayer beads, etc. There are also several, and the business is not sluggish.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of this company: (1) The buildings are too old and not decorated, which does not attract people's attention. (2) Each shop operates independently, like a collection of small shops, and it is not worthy of being called a company. However, there are also some advantages: (1) Each shop competes for business, so the prices are not expensive. (2) Each item is marked with a price, and there is no bargaining. (3) The shop assistants are still polite.</p>
<p>(2) National Goods Market This market is in Qinghefang, and it is probably a temporary display. The entrance is blowing horns and beating drums, with the full color of a Shanghai store's big price reduction and big auction. Running in to take a look, 70 to 80 percent of the goods are really from Shanghai, haha! This is really in a relative position to the National Goods Company mentioned above. One is Hangzhou people doing business with people from other places; the other is Shanghai people doing business with Hangzhou people. Inside, there are stalls one by one, just like the Shanghai City God Temple. The things sold are mostly factory cloth, socks, cosmetics, galoshes, and so on. The salespeople are also brought down from Shanghai, with oily hair, powdered faces, and striding, which can really scare the old Hangzhou locals.</p>
<p>What are the advantages of this market? What are the shortcomings? As a Shanghai person, it is not convenient for me to criticize. However, I can write out something I witnessed: A Hangzhou person bought socks from a certain stall, and the price was marked in big dollars, but the Hangzhou person still bargained with small dollars. The salesperson clipped a pencil behind his ear and ignored him. The Hangzhou person asked him again if he would sell it or not? He hummed in his nose and scolded: "Damn it, you might as well steal a pair!"</p>
<p>Whether salespeople are polite or not is a small matter, but it has a great impact on business. I hope that the salespeople in Shanghai's shops will quickly get rid of this bad habit, especially national goods companies, which should pay more attention to this point.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to the Clothes, Hats, Shoes, and Socks of Newlyweds in Group Weddings</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>The second Shanghai Group Wedding will have 34 couples again, held in the Municipal Government Auditorium on May 1st! Pearl-like light and shadows, so many people gathering! What a flourishing event! But are the clothes, hats, shoes, and socks of the newlyweds national goods? Worthy of attention! We know: Except for the Maya Silk Weaving Factory, which can take the opportunity to promote sales, the rest of the national goods industry is unknown! I feel very frustrated! Because there are several questions that we need to discuss: Is the hat a national good? Are the leather shoes national goods? Are the socks national goods? Even Maya silk twill, can everyone use it completely? Now is the era when the court and the public are unanimously advocating national goods! Even small things like handkerchiefs or inner shirts cannot be ignored. If the inspection finds that there are newcomers with imported goods, they should be refused to participate! I think the China National Goods Company should come and serve. Another point is that since the brides are ordered to prohibit perms! Then high heels and foreign cosmetics should also be absolutely prohibited! Secondly, after swearing marriage in public, promise not to purchase foreign goods for the rest of your life! Swear with sincerity, love the country, and love national goods! Only in this way can we be worthy of the group wedding of the new life!</p>
<h3>How Students Should Promote National Goods</h3>
<p>— Wei Jizheng, Datong University</p>
<p>Promoting national goods is the way to help the endangered and save the country, and it is the key to making the country rich and the people prosperous. Promoting national goods can promote national spirit and restore the inherent morality of the nation. From this, it can be seen that the national goods movement has a profound meaning. All citizens should take responsibility and rise up to promote it, so as to save the country from its crisis.</p>
<p>This year is the Student National Goods Year, concentrating the responsibility of promoting and using national goods on us students. This is because young people are the backbone of society, and students are in a leading position among the people. We are fortunate to be students and to be in a leading position among the people. Therefore, for this national salvation movement with such a profound meaning, we should shout out and invigorate the spirit and be the vanguard of the front line!</p>
<p>Facts and theories are two different things. Now is not the time to save the country by sitting down and talking empty theories! We can only do it practically and down-to-earth, which is the key task at present. We are students. From the perspective of students, we should also pay attention to how to do the national goods movement practically within the scope of our position. The following will discuss how students should do it:</p>
<p>(1) Start from today: The reason why many national salvation movements in the past have been ineffective is that they were superficial and not practical. They only knew how to shout slogans but could not practice what they preached. As a result, they delayed and missed the opportunity, day after day. As the saying goes, "deliberate but not decide, decide but not act" cannot achieve practical results. The Analects says, "If you have faults, don't be afraid to correct them" and "To have faults and not correct them is to have faults." The Chinese economic crisis has reached its extreme. The majority of the reason is, of course, the result of the people not using national goods, but also the result of the people's problem of knowing their faults but not correcting them. The boycott movement in the past was not just once, but it ended up fizzling out and disappearing. Now that we know that promoting national goods has such a close relationship with the rise and fall of the nation and the survival of the country, we should use an indomitable spirit and immediately correct our faults. We should make the greatest determination, start from today, and never use foreign goods again. We must never follow the same old path of delaying and missing the opportunity. Everyone should have the belief that "if you can improve yourself one day, do so every day, and keep doing so." If the entire student community does this, after this year's Student National Goods Year, all students will have taken the responsibility of promoting national goods starting from today, and they will swear not to use foreign goods again. It will not take more than one National Goods Year, and foreign goods will not disappear and national goods will not develop. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Understanding Students Should Have of National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Zou Sili, Weiyu Elementary School</p>
<p>Everyone knows now that our China is extremely weak. However, we must not let it simply pass away like this; we must find a way to save this endangered China. Some people advocate "revitalizing industry," "popularizing education," "expanding military power," and so on. Indeed, these are all methods to save China from its peril, but there is one more thing that cannot be ignored: that is, "promoting national goods."</p>
<p>Most Chinese people like to use foreign goods, which has resulted in a significant outflow of money. The government, seeing this situation, knows that there must be someone to take the lead in promoting national goods in order to encourage the people to follow suit. Therefore, various National Goods Years have been established.</p>
<p>Last year was Women's National Goods Year, and the result was a failure. There are several reasons for the failure: (1) Some women only know how to buy glamorous foreign clothes and cosmetics for their own beauty, forgetting their patriotism. (2) Most modern women compete with each other in beauty, taking pride in wearing foreign goods. Ordinary women also imitate them. Therefore, the quantity of foreign goods imported only increased day by day, even more than the quantity imported before the Women's National Goods Year was promoted. As a result, the Women's National Goods Year was in name only.</p>
<p>This year is Student National Goods Year, and we students are taking the lead. We are all educated people and also the future masters of the new China.</p>
<p>Of course, we must bear a great responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, during this Student National Goods Year, I hope that all my fellow students will work hard to promote national goods.</p>
<h3>My Hopes for Student National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Wu Jianmei, Sixth Grade, Huamin Elementary School</p>
<p>The economy of society is experiencing panic day by day. To avoid this major crisis, we must devote ourselves to the popular sale of national goods. Of course, it is a matter of course for Chinese people to use Chinese goods.</p>
<p>However, how many people are truly willing to use national goods? For example, in the past "National Goods Year" and "Women's National Goods Year," the government could be considered active in encouraging people to use national goods; however, pitifully, the more national goods were promoted, the more the import surplus of foreign goods increased year by year. From this point of view, we can only say that the Chinese people are too disappointing!</p>
<p>Now, the four words "use national goods" have been placed on us students; because students are young people with hot blood, and are constantly seeking knowledge and able to understand the morbid state of the current social economy; so putting this burden on us is reasonable, and at the same time, we also recognize that we have the confidence to do so.</p>
<p>Students, rouse your spirits! From now on, for what we eat, use, and wear, we will not buy anything but national goods, and we will not use anything but national goods. Work hard! Work hard! What will the results be? Wait and see next year today!</p>
<h3>My Views on Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Fang Huizhen, Danhua Elementary School</p>
<p>The four words "promote national goods" have taken away an unknown amount of manuscript fees, made the secretary's hand sore from writing, and been reported day and night on the wireless asking how to use national goods, but what was the result? Wasn't it still a complete failure?</p>
<p>In the annual import surplus, intellectuals are responsible for more than half. This point really makes us feel ashamed to death for those farmers who work hard with their own hands. Originally, it can be said that it is the inherent obligation of a country's people to use national goods, not only students should do this, but everyone should do it as well. Here, I will only talk about intellectuals:</p>
<p>You must know that all the shifts in social customs, the salvation of the decline of public spirit, and the advocacy of national consciousness all follow the intellectuals. If intellectuals can lead by example, bravely promote and improve the atmosphere, there is no way that they will not be victorious. Promoting national goods is no exception.</p>
<p>Although intellectuals are not a large proportion of the Chinese population, they are still the pioneers and mainstays in the team that consumes foreign goods, especially female intellectuals! To put it further, intellectuals are the culprits who are invisibly destroying the country.</p>
<p>As for the methods of promoting national goods, people have already said everything, so I really can't come up with a Zhang Tianshi-like wonderful method that can save the national goods crisis. I only have a few after-the-fact, limited views:</p>
<p>(1) Get up and do it instead of sitting and talking... valuing empty talk is China's biggest problem in catching up with Europe and the United States, so to promote national goods, we must focus on actually doing it, and we must do it strictly. All promoters should act consistently in their words and deeds, set an example, and supervise their subordinates to promote it together. For example, school principals, teachers, and administrative officials should be pioneers for the people and keep working hard continuously. You must know that since the opening of the sea ban in our country, the enjoyment of Western material civilization has almost become the lifelong goal of the Chinese people. Such deep-rooted bad habits will definitely not be effective in the short term by posting slogans, shouting slogans, and taking a picture of two eight-inch group meetings.</p>
<p>(2) Reward good and punish evil... Most young students have weak willpower, strong vanity, and lack of self-government ability, and everyone has a strong passivity, so for these slave-like students, we should use the method of rewarding good and punishing evil to force them to use national goods, and not let them be free. For example, students in school must wear national goods uniforms, and those who disobey will be expelled from school as a punishment. Public opinion should also unanimously attack them. For the sake of national interests, the law can only temporarily not protect personal (referring to clothing) freedom in order to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred. At the same time, those who use national goods should also be given various preferential treatments as rewards. For example, if unemployed people are enthusiastic about national goods, various institutions should give them preferential treatment when hiring them, or students who are enthusiastic about national goods should be given material or honorary rewards. You must know that it is human nature to love fame. Promoters should seize this point to attract interest and determination, and create an atmosphere of thrift.</p>
<p>In short, if promoters can take action and enforce rewards and punishments clearly, good results will naturally be produced soon. Otherwise, promoting national goods will be like promoting the prohibition of opium, which is ridiculous. May I ask, how many years can China afford to have an import surplus of 80 to 90 million yuan?</p>
<p>Words are not about quantity, but about practice. Now that the Chinese people know that promoting national goods is one of the urgent tasks to save the national crisis, they should repeatedly feel the pain and encourage themselves to work hard.</p>

<h3>Finance: Silver Prices Soar; Benchmark Gold Sees New Low of $784.70</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a dramatic surge in overseas silver prices, hitting a new low of $784.70. However, due to excessive short positions, demand outstripped supply after the dip. The foreign exchange market tightened due to settlement demands, gradually rebounding. Swap premiums also rose sharply, seemingly stimulating sentiment. Buying interest increased sharply at noon, showing a bullish trend. Initially, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US saw unanimous sharp rises. Although large traders booked profits after the market closed, price fluctuations were minimal. Forward silver prices even rose by three cents. Foreign exchange rates remained largely unchanged, and London gold prices fell by one penny, leading to market fatigue. Off-market pre-trading fell to $91-92, lacking support, and further broke through the $90 mark, retreating to $86-87 before stabilizing slightly. The Central Bank's benchmark gold standard price was lowered to $851.30. The market opened lower in the morning. After the opening, major players sold off, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also sold, creating a low of $784.70. However, due to overcrowded short positions, buyers flocked in after the dip, and banks also gradually stabilized by taking advantage of the cheap prices to settle accounts. The HSBC benchmark was announced, with the pound rising by 2.5 and the US dollar by half a dollar, having little impact. British American Tobacco Company stepped in to settle accounts, and Sassoon also struggled to find a suitable counterparty for settlement, breaking through $90. Later, as the silver equalization tax was announced to be unchanged, sellers took advantage of the high prices to move, retreating back into the $90 range. However, bank appetite remained strong, and domestic prices remained stable. At this point, there was considerable fluctuation. Later, the foreign exchange market tightened further, boosting buying interest due to a lack of supply, forming a short squeeze, and gradually trending upward. At noon close, prices fell slightly due to profit-taking, but remained bullish after the close. The half-day trend was weak initially but then strengthened, due to inconsistencies in the foreign exchange market and the benefit of leveraged buying. The future is difficult to predict. The swap premium was posted by short sellers at $3 yesterday, stimulating sentiment significantly. Now, the half-day market conditions are summarized below:</p>
<p>The market opened at $789 in the morning, down $14.20 from the previous close. July US dollars were at 75, lacking buyers.

After the close, buying interest was even stronger. Although transactions were few, they gradually rose to around $7. The highest price in the half-day was $797.80, and the lowest price was $784.70, with a total fluctuation of $13.10. As a result, it fell $7.70 compared to the previous close.</p>

Swap premiums rose sharply. Short sellers Yingfeng and Heng posted 49 futures to Juchang at $2, and Yuanheng posted 21 futures to Hengyu at $3.

<h3>Settlement Relations: Foreign Exchange Initially Loose, Then Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegraphs, London saw large price increases in both near and far terms, by one penny and four three seven five. Traders stated that although a large number of profit-takers exited after the market closed, market prices saw minimal change. New York silver prices rose by two points two five, and forward silver markets in Montreal were also higher by two points six half to three points. London gold prices fell by one penny. The British exchange rate against the US dollar remained unchanged, while the US dollar against the British pound shrank by one two five. The British exchange rate against the French franc fell by five pounds. The US dollar against the French exchange rose by one two five. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with short-term selling prices, with the British exchange rate at one shilling seven pence seven five, and the US exchange rate at thirty-nine yuan eight seven five, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate was one five six two five looser, and the US dollar was one eight seven five harder. The Central Bank's benchmark was announced, with the British exchange rate rising by two five, and the US dollar rising by half a yuan. London gold prices fell by two points two and a half percent. Sentiment was difficult to boost. After opening, there was excessive looseness, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also sold out. Banks maintained prices by taking advantage of the cheap prices. Anticipating that HSBC would announce a benchmark of two five for the British exchange rate and half a yuan for the US dollar, sentiment remained stable and gradually leveled off. After entering, British American Tobacco Company and Sassoon both had buying interest, and turned tight. However, banks had inconsistent demands for supply. The silver equalization tax was announced to be unchanged and still fluctuated. Finally, although the Central Bank and Chinese merchants supplied, they could not match the strong buying interest of banks and brokers. The process became tight again. At noon close, the short-term selling prices were the British exchange rate at one shilling seven pence six two five and six eight seven five, and the US exchange rate at thirty-nine yuan seven five, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate was zero six two five looser, and the US dollar was zero six two five harder. Supply in Chinese merchants was greater than demand, squeezing out approximately 50,000 pounds in shillings and more than 300,000 yuan in US dollars. Silver companies and Xinfeng both bought US dollars. Qiao Zhifu and Shanghai Central sold shillings. Banks still had strong appetites. Now, the half-day transaction records are listed below:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with a short-term selling price of one shilling seven pence seven five. Qiao Zhifu sold July seven five to McGalli. McGalli sold the same month six eight seven five. Huabi Youli and Great Britain bought July five six two five.  Jing bought June six two five. Shanghai sold June six two five to Citibank Datong.

<h3>Financial Industry Turns Danger into Safety: The Overall Situation Stabilizes Over the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the long-term inability to adjust and balance the bottom of the green four, two exchange clearing firms ran aground, and the market suddenly became terrified. Fortunately, over the past two days, the authorities of the industry made every effort to find a solution, and the two thousand million yuan of loans from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank were successfully negotiated and properly secured, so that the difficulties could be safely overcome. It is hoped that there will be no major changes in the future. The interbank lending rate remained at one cent in the morning and afternoon markets yesterday, without any rise or fall. However, due to the disparity between long and short positions in clearing, the price had to be competitively bid up, eventually reaching a massive four and a half cents in the small clearinghouse, and there were still a few million to clear. As a result, the banks made a large number of pledges, totaling more than 3.2 million, before they could be straightened out. However, the value of the returned pledges was only more than 700,000, with the banknotes recovered and issued into circulation 900,000, memorandum notes 300,000, interbank bill transactions redeemed 3.5 million, new transactions 30,000, afternoon market transactions 20,000, small clearinghouse transactions 40,000, customer source 30,000, outgoing interest 20,000, bank collection and settlement, foreign banks collected and settled bills for 3.23 million, collected and settled various goods, foreign exchange pledges and miscellaneous payments for 4.89 million, special remittances for 700,000, foreign exchange settlement for 890,000, and warehousing for 800,000. Chinese banks collected and settled bills for slightly less than 3 million, collected and settled various goods, foreign exchange taxes and miscellaneous payments for 5.67 million, foreign exchange settlement for more than 1.4 million, special remittances for 600,000, and out-of-warehouse for 400,000. Japanese banks collected and settled bills for more than 2.6 million, collected and settled various goods, foreign exchange miscellaneous payments for 3.45 million, foreign exchange settlement for more than 1.4 million, special collections for more than 1.4 million, special remittances for 600,000, and warehousing for 700,000. Money shops and foreign public bills collected and settled more than 29 million, and foreign exchange clearing head payments collected and settled 5.89 million, customer remittance 50,000, and cash settlement 1.5 million. Yesterday, the small silver coins of Jiangnan were 837 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better by one yuan compared to the morning market of the previous day, making transactions, with 6,000 corners in the morning market and 4,000 corners in the afternoon market. The small silver coins of Guangdong were 732 yuan and 3 corners in the morning market, and the afternoon market was better by 4 corners, at 732 yuan and 7 corners. The transactions were 120,000 corners in the morning market and 75,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to increase by 500 characters, to 337,500 characters, with transactions of 37,125, equivalent to 11,000 yuan in silver. The total number of exchanges at the city's bill exchange on the 24th was 9,431,534 yuan, 9 jiao and 9 fen, including 5,199,586 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen in original silver, and 4,231,948 yuan and 7 jiao in exchange silver.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bond Transactions Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange halted trading in the April period. The market made a five-day, one-month period. The environment had poor news, and the market transaction disappeared, so there were no disturbances. The market trading may be noteworthy. Four months bought, and the eleventh sold, but the number was also slight. On the root side, because even the mountainous silver and foreign banks were cleared, clearing water was about four angles. Yesterday passed, there were only a few retail transactions. Qing, the morning plate was the most, six or seven kinds failed to open, and the rest also completely no rise or fall. One was never done in the market Qing with less than twenty afternoon, selling has been increased, prices were also somewhat more solid, the volume increased slightly, future changes, still with the environment good or bad into the retreat ear, the result slightly better than five points an angle of one to two jiao half the total amount, a total of about three hundred sixty one million yuan which the results of the increase or decrease, comparing a list to the left, (unit yuan transaction unit hundred yuan),</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Closes Higher</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Feng Trading Company, yesterday (23rd) the New York stock market experienced profit-taking by bulls, fluctuating throughout the day. However, at the close, due to short covering in railroad stocks, the trend showed a clear upward movement. Mining stocks were particularly strong, attributed to the sharp rise in silver prices. There was widespread expectation that the Ministry of Finance would soon further increase the domestic price of newly mined silver. This was also partly related to the dividend distribution of two dollars by Dooms Mining Company. Prices were mixed but generally firm due to low call money rates. U.S. government bonds were particularly strong. Small exchange stocks were stable. Total daily trading volume was 1.23 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>April 22nd April 23rd Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials 20.27 20.06 Down 0.21</p>
<p>20 Railroads 30.54 31.27 Up 0.73</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn: Marked-up Yarn Soars, Bulls Emerge, This Month's Yarn Shows Sole Increase</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken, with another round of price declines, stemming from the lackluster overseas cotton market. Market sources say that a certain individual's long positions in far-month contracts have been fully liquidated, with even talk of switching to short positions. Consequently, general speculative traders rushed to sell, resulting in a noticeably unstable market. However, the current month's contracts continued to be taken in as usual, with the final board remaining firm at $183, only nine cents higher than the end-of-March price.</p>
<p>This Month's Yarn Up $1.10</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for marked-up yarn saw a uniform decline across all contract months, displaying an exceptionally weak posture. Selling pressure in the market was intense, driven by rumors that a major bull was flipping to a short position in the far months, temporarily abandoning the long side. This caused uncertainty among general retail investors, making the market increasingly loose and volatile. As a result, prices for each month fell by 8, 9 cents to one dollar compared to the previous day's closing. However, the current month remained unchanged. At the afternoon opening, the current month rose by $1.10 due to a certain individual buying at the morning's closing price, with far months rising by 2 to 4 cents. However, spot yarn trading remained sluggish. Sales included 1,250 bales of Mei Kee, 2,650 bales of Yu Da, 1,300 bales of He Xing, 1,400 bales of Ren Feng, 850 bales of Chang Yu, 1,050 bales of Sheng Yuan, 1,550 bales of Sui Long, 1,750 bales of Da Ji, and 550 bales of Da Chang. Purchases included 850 bales of Tong Ji, 1,600 bales of Da Feng, 3,650 bales of Jin Chang, 500 bales of Yuan Yi, 2,450 bales of Chang Feng, 1,150 bales of Yong Da, 1,950 bales of Xin Cheng, and 850 bales of Geng. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Supply Reaches 10,000 Bales, Imported Cotton Prices Also Favorable</h3>
<p>This month is the last day for the cotton market. The market was sluggish due to ample deliveries, pressured by unfavorable conditions all around. Overseas silver prices soared, and gold prices repeatedly hit new lows. Furthermore, with U.S. cotton also falling, conversion prices became even cheaper. Therefore, the outlook for the cotton market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>This Month's Cotton Falls by Half a Dollar</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for marked-up cotton showed a uniform downward trend across all months, once again showing weakness. Overseas silver prices were exceptionally high, and gold prices broke through the 800-dollar mark again. However, U.S. cotton prices still fell by five points, and Indian cotton also fell by 1.2 rupees. Exchange rates rose, and imported cotton conversion prices trended lower. As a result, fewer buyers were present in the market, and the market was weak. Ultimately, each month fell by 2 to 3 cents compared to the previous day's closing. At the afternoon opening, the current month showed instability due to the expected delivery of 10,000 bales, creating a sense of relaxation. As a result, it fell by 3 cents compared to the morning's closing price, while the far months rose by 5 to 10 cents. The current month's final closing price was $34.30, $1.45 higher than the end-of-March price. Sales included 2,000 bales of Chang Ji, 3,800 bales of Yu Da, 3,800 bales of Da Feng, 1,700 bales of He Yu, 2,900 bales of Chang Yu, 2,700 bales of Yong Da, 1,000 bales of De Ji, 1,900 bales of Yi, 1,800 bales of Yi Chang, and 2,500 bales of Chang Feng. Purchases included 1,100 bales of Da Fu, 2,200 bales of Chang, 1,000 bales of Rui Da, 2,200 bales of Jun Chang, 2,800 bales of Tai Chang, 5,200 bales of Wei He, 2,200 bales of Yuan Da, 1,500 bales of Jian Kang, and 1,200 bales of Xie Cheng. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot cotton sales remain sluggish, with factories slow to take action. With inexpensive imported cotton, there is a trend of outsiders taking over the dominant position. Sources include 3,350 bales of Yao Cotton.</p>
<p>Womula 4,100 bales. Shenxin Factory took delivery of 1,000 pieces of spot goods immediately.</p>

<h3>May U.S. Cotton Longs Liquidated, Market Still Feels Solid</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with a lack of major buyers. Prices for each month fell slightly by 2 to 5 points. New Orleans sales, the liquidation of May longs, and the possibility of rain contributed. However, the market situation felt stable. Spinning mills continued to reduce production. Until Washington announces its attitude towards new cotton, prices are not expected to change significantly. In the afternoon, buying by industry peers slightly stabilized the market, closing flat. October was down 5 points. Futures ranged from 4 to 8 points. English cotton spot prices rose one point, and futures rose 4 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to strong spot sales and buying by Japanese firms, but retreated due to long liquidation. As a result, Pingguo fell one rupee, Aomula fell 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, and Bairuo Creek fell 0.25 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 23rd):</p>

<h3>Grains: Clear and Warm Weather, Long Positions Liquidated in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened weakly in the morning, with prices showing little upward momentum across all months. Imported wheat quotes from Chicago fell by 90 cents to $1.00, while Canadian quotes fell by around 37.8 cents. Initially, the weakness in imported wheat, followed by favorable weather, prompted the liquidation of long positions in both near and far-month contracts. Major and minor mills also slightly reduced their holdings, making far-month contracts particularly volatile. However, at the afternoon opening, the near-month contract turned firm due to approaching delivery dates and insufficient mill inventories. Trading in far-month contracts was light, and when mills stopped selling, the market stabilized. Future price movements will depend on exchange rates and weather conditions. If the weather remains clear and new wheat crops are in good condition, a different situation may emerge. As a result, the current month fell by half a cent, May fell by one cent, June fell by 2.25 cents, July and August fell by 2 cents, and September fell by 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Fall Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures initially fell and then stabilized. Imported wheat quotes from Chicago fell by 90 cents to $1.00, while Canadian quotes fell by 30 cents. At the opening, favorable weather and falling imported wheat prices caused market sentiment to fluctuate. The current month showed weakness due to the loosening of spot wheat prices and continued imports of foreign wheat by mills, temporarily reducing the demand for domestic wheat. The opening price was soft, with far-month contracts even more unstable, falling by 3 to 5 cents. However, short covering improved the situation slightly. In the afternoon, the current month continued to fall due to mills' lack of interest in taking delivery, and far-month contracts continued to decline following the flat wheat market. As a result, the current month fell by a significant 9 cents, and July, August, and September fell by 4 cents. In the spot wheat market, mill demand was weak, and prices fell by 3 to 5 cents. Shandong wheat was quoted at $3.95 to $3.96, Yingzhou and Suzhou wheat at $3.94 to $3.95, Luohe wheat at $3.89, Haizhou Daliji wheat at $3.87 to $3.88, and Hankou wheat at $3.75, and second-grade at $3.72. Fuxin took delivery of 3,000 bags, and Fufeng took delivery of 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: The liquidation of long positions in May and forecasts of rain in the Southwest led to widespread selling. The buying side's ability to absorb this supply was insufficient. Before delivery, any upward movement in the market is likely to trigger the sale of May long positions.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat April 22nd April 23rd Change</p>
<p>May 102.00 99.155 Down 2.875</p>
<p>July 101.25 98.125 Down 3.125</p>

<h3>River Rice Arrivals are Quite Crowded, Northern Traders Trial Min Dang Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, shipments of River Rice to Shanghai's southern wharves suddenly increased significantly, with over forty shipments arriving (approximately 8,000 shi). This caused concern, and the market immediately became stagnant, with prices gradually softening. As a result, premium thick japonica rice prices fell by one to two dimes, while late indica rice, despite Weihaiwei traders trying to handle over 500 bags, remained unpopular with local merchants, also falling by one to two dimes. Yin Yuan rice, being scarce, maintained its strength. Arrivals in the northern and downstream areas of Shanghai totaled eighteen to nineteen ships. The early market for various destinations for white japonica rice remained sluggish, with prices initially dropping by a small amount. However, the market improved and strengthened in the afternoon. Early thin indica rice arrivals continued, with consumption being flat and prices declining by a small amount to one dime. White Yuan River inventory remained high, with slow sales leading to a slight price drop of one to two dimes. The prices of other varieties showed a downward trend.</p>
<p>The situation for foreign sen rice was as follows: Morning transactions were weak, and despite strong interest from inland traders potentially affected by financial factors, they remained cautious. Local demand was weak, and traders along the Yangtze River were also planning to maintain small volume purchases, causing the market to weaken. Later, northern traders experimented with Min Dang rice, and famous traders in inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang took advantage of the low prices to start stocking up again, pushing the market back to its earlier position. Total daily trading volume was over 12,000 bags of foreign rice and 200 bags of sen rice, with inland areas remaining the primary destination. Local traders bought a small amount of high-priced foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Soybean Stocks Pile Up in the Market, Continued Arrivals but Weak Factory Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market weakened compared to the previous market. The reasons were slow sales of soybean cakes and weak oil prices, causing oil mills to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Additionally, stocks at the bottom of the market were ample, with reports of approximately 300 cars of vehicle beans and 17,000 to 18,000 bags of Henan beans. There were also rumors in the market that a large batch of Canada beans was expected to arrive, totaling about 10,000 bags, causing sentiment to turn bearish. Fortunately, some inland oil workshops were still buying, stabilizing prices. However, these workshops also reduced their purchases due to high prices. Given the current overall trend, the market may experience a slight rebound due to various negative factors. Dalian soybeans were constrained by Dalian telegraphs, and prices remained flat. Hankou beans were sold as soon as they arrived, and the market was stable. The transactions included one car of Kaiyingzhou beans at $3.65, one car of Quanhe beans at $3.80, one car of Dashu Sipingjie beans at $4.35, thirty-six bags of Andong beans at $5.20, 200 bags of Hankou Zha beans at $3.91, and 500 bags of Hankou Chi beans at prices ranging from $3.74 to $3.68. Sixty bags of Chongming Sand Yellow beans were sold at $3.60. The destinations were primarily inland vehicle workshops and local traders.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Continues to Fall, Transactions Remain Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to soften due to further declines in Customs Gold Units and tight credit conditions, resulting in limited buying interest. The association set the price for 24 crude granulated white sugar at $17.30, down one dime, but no transactions were made. Re-export goods fell by another two dimes to $5.50, with some trading activity. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned off a batch of Guangdong crude white sugar, totaling 2,000 bags, with bids ranging from $17.20 to $17.10, down one dime each. However, only ten bags were sold. Local refined white sugar also fell by two dimes, with Zhenyu No. 1 at $16.60. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 followed suit, with limited trading volume. In the futures market, Ewo offered a batch of Dutch crude white sugar, approximately 3,000 bags, expected to arrive on May 18th, priced at 3.15 Dutch guilders. Wing On Taichang also quoted the same price, but no transactions were made.</p>
<p>Another report: Transactions were also made at yesterday's Dongtang price setting. Yp Mark $17.10, YT $17.00.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Offers No Hope</h3>
<p>Although overseas silk markets in New York and Yokohama have risen slightly, the lengthening of exchange rates is impacting the foreign trade of this port, and the silk industry remains desolate. This year, Citibank branches have been extremely dismal, and there is no hope for strong demand from England and France. The Indian coarse silk market is filled with Japanese goods, which is painful to say. User transactions are nonexistent due to sluggish silk sales and tight credit conditions. Silk prices and market sentiment remain stagnant.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Tea Has Opened for Sale</h3>
<p>Since Grain Rain, new tea in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, has begun to be harvested on all mountains. Due to favorable weather, the output is good. Tea producers, encouraged by strong black tea sales last year, are mostly producing black tea. Future production from this area is expected to be over 10,000 boxes of black tea and only a few thousand boxes of green tea. In recent days, the mountains have been producing abundant rough tea. After negotiations between tea farmers and merchants, the initial market price was set at $34. It is said that even lower-quality tea must fetch around $30.</p>
<h3>Metals: Corrugated Iron Lacks Vigor</h3>
<p>The corrugated iron market has been exceptionally stagnant recently. Due to the poor economic environment, construction companies have limited buying power, and local business has not improved. The current market price for 24-gauge is estimated at $11.50 per bundle, down two dimes and five cents from before. 16-gauge is estimated at $12.25 per bundle, also down one dime. 28-gauge is estimated at only $11.85 per bundle, down slightly more than two dimes. Surveys show that only two to three hundred bundles have been sold, significantly less than in previous years. New shipments from Japan are arriving, further increasing the stock levels in the market. With such limited sales, market sentiment is extremely weak.</p>

<h3>What Can We Learn from Whitman?</h3>
<p>— Huanping</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>"This (referring to Leaves of Grass - author) is not a book. Touching it is like touching humanity."</p>
<p>"...In the foundation of the collection of poems, 'Leaves of Grass,' I reject all inherited subject matter. Readymade ornamentation, ideas taken from love and war, the heroes and great men of the old world's poetry – in short, anything that exists solely for beauty – legends, myths, romances, euphemisms, rhythm, all of that, I want none of it. I take what I need from the multitude of ordinary people and their individuality in this now increasingly mature 19th century, especially from the abundant examples and practical occupations of Americans."</p>
<p>When it comes to poetry, many people seem to regard the mysterious, the profound, and the elusive as its characteristics. As a result, even in modern times, many poems are produced, even in foreign countries, that are difficult for anyone to understand other than the author himself.</p>
<p>However, this so-called first person of modern democracy, the originator of free verse in the world, Walt Whitman (1819-1892), told us this.</p>
<p>Whitman lived from the beginning to the end of the nineteenth century. This period was precisely when the United States broke away from the shackles of England and was developing towards capitalism at an ultra-fast pace on its vast resources. Whitman was a cell in this development process. He was a passionate man. He saw this ultra-fast development, and his heart was beating in harmony with it. He had to sing these upward, lively, constructive, social phenomena. This is the starting point of his poetry, the starting point of the most practical reality. He did not want anything of the past, anything old; he did not want anything ideal, anything fictional; what he wanted was "…the greatest number of ordinary people…and practical occupations." This is completely opposite to poets who pursue ideals and "illusions beyond the heavens." Our era is similar to Whitman's in some respects. We need Whitman's poetry. His realistic creative attitude, which stems entirely from reality, is the first thing we should learn.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>"A single blade of grass is no less in its greatness and mystery than the movement of the stars."</p>
<p>Many poets dislike the ordinary and like the mysterious, living an absolutely beautified life in an ivory tower. As if this is the only way to be a poet! However, Whitman is by no means such an unrealistic poet. He loves the ordinary, so ordinary that even a blade of grass, he would say, "Take all the art and science in the world" and place it before it, "making it worthless and kowtowing." He not only praises the grass (nature), he especially blesses and praises life.</p>
<p>O groups of men and women dressed in ordinary clothes,</p>
<p>How precious you are</p>
<p>Reflected in my eyes!</p>
<p>He sang in this way as he walked past the Brooklyn ferry. He doesn't like strangely dressed, elegantly postured ladies; nor does he like elegantly dressed, heavily made-up young masters; he doesn't associate with them, he doesn't live with them. He always likes "groups of men and women in ordinary clothes." Not only does he like them, he also associates with them and lives with them. For example, when the Civil War broke out in 1860, he spent two years on the battlefield, caring for more than 20,000 wounded soldiers. And many of his good poems were produced during this period. Abe Hideo of Japan also commented on this point of him:</p>
<p>"To him, the dockworkers, boatmen, and coachmen of New York's wharves are more beautiful than any mythical hero."</p>
<p>However, he does not blindly worship and sing praises of nature and life. He has his own view of life. Although his view of life is still limited by the social and cultural development conditions of the time. In "Song of Myself," he sings out his essence:</p>
<p>I accept "reality," I do not doubt it at all</p>
<p>Consistently permeated with a materialistic view.</p>
<p>He used the method of understanding that his society taught him at the time, standing at the forefront of the era, to observe all objects, all thoughts, and all life. No, not only to observe, but he also threw himself into the practical practice of real life. The reason why he became a great poet of the world and is still recited by later generations is due to these aspects. And those poets who sing of the mysterious fade away in an instant, and this is not accidental either. This is the second thing we should learn from Whitman.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>"On the roof of the world - America - is filled with wild cries!"</p>
<p>The content of Whitman's poetry is something completely new. It is the life of the continuing established American capitalist society, and the uninhibited emotions of the emerging American bourgeoisie, who feel completely free on the fertile new continent without feudal shackles. This new content is bound to conflict with the traditional poetic forms. However, he could not adapt to it. He practiced the theory that whatever form the content demands, the form is always determined by the content. He was very brave, he was not afraid of people's attacks and scolding, and resolutely broke through the narrow rhyme poetic form with his rich content, creating a new poetic form – free verse – based on the rhythm within itself.</p>
<p>The narrow, rigid, rhyming poetic forms of the past, such as the five-character and seven-character quatrains of China, are indeed difficult to express vast themes. And the freedom and life of the American bourgeoisie at that time inevitably demanded a reflection in poetry. This inevitably led Whitman to break with tradition and create free verse.</p>
<p>Since the vernacular poetry movement in our country, although it has broken the shackles of five-character and seven-character quatrains, etc., and adopted the free poetic form, it has not yet developed to any great height to this day. And among them, many roundabout tendencies have emerged, such as "mantis climbing the wall," "pursuing illusions beyond the heavens," etc. To this day, there are still many poems in the poetry world that only the poets themselves understand.</p>
<p>Society is asking us to adopt more magnificent forms to express a social life that is more complex and vast than the historical era of Whitman. Let us learn more from Whitman.</p>
<h3>Recommendation of "Geographical Factors in World History"</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>"The evolution of historical events, although having many social and economic causes, upon further examination, reveals that these social and economic causes cannot exist independently of the Earth. On the contrary, they are closely related to the Earth's surface. Because humans are creatures of the Earth, their activities cannot extend beyond it, and thus human history is inextricably limited by geographical conditions.</p>
<p>From the very first chapter, the author reveals the essence of this work, explaining the interconnectedness of history and geography. Originally, it was our common practice to conflate history and geography; teachers in classrooms cannot separate geography from history lessons, and likewise, geography lessons sometimes require mentioning historical events. However, the historical and geographical texts of China have always been connected but distinctly separated, a truly perplexing matter. This is why I am motivated to introduce this new book.</p>
<p>This Japanese-style, 16mo softcover book, no more than half an inch thick, is printed beautifully and is soon to be displayed in bookstore windows—"Geographical Factors in World History." Its structure is based entirely on history as the warp and geography as the weft, a comprehensive approach. As the author states, "...the subject matter of this book mainly concerns the transformation of geographical factors in history; therefore, the specific historical details are, of course, relatively insufficiently explained..." Thus, we cannot truly regard it as a rigid history book, nor can we truly regard it as a rigid geography book, because it is a compound, not a mixture, of history and geography, possessing a unique flavor. Neglecting this significance would undoubtedly lead to serious disappointment.</p>
<p>Similarly, we see that its structure, from the second to the fifth sections, seems to emphasize vertical narratives of history, while later sections seem to focus on horizontal analyses, differing significantly from the general methods of dividing history and geography. Most importantly, the discussions and critiques of both history and geography adopt a certain standard for selection and omission, avoiding excessive fragmentation. This is because the author constantly focuses on the improvement of key productive forces and means of production as the center. Thus, we believe that this history-geography compound created by the author's social science mindset is an extremely necessary reorganization of history and geography science in this era.</p>
<p>Speaking of the book's content, it is very rich, because in addition to history and geography, the author includes several times more political and economic knowledge, and seems to write with even greater confidence. Just look at the sixth section, "Characteristics of the Modern World," and the sections that follow, which present several clear principles for the evolution of world politics and economics. Speaking so fluently, how can they be purely geographical factors? If we were to say that it is a history of international politics or a history of the evolution of the world economy, I'm afraid the author would have to partially agree. Therefore, I boldly recommend it to general social science researchers, even more enthusiastically than recommending it to mere history and geography students as an "entryway into the field!"</p>
<h3>Sketches of the City God Temple</h3>
<h3>Mountain Idyll (4)</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>"The golden hairpin on her head was bought by her brother,</p>
<p>The baby in her belly belongs to the coolie."</p>
<p>Then she switched to a woman's voice, singing a rebuttal:</p>
<p>"The three elder sisters-in-law cross the river to the east,</p>
<p>The one in the middle is your mother!</p>
<p>The golden hairpin on her head was given by her father,</p>
<p>The baby in her belly is your reincarnation!"</p>
<p>Old Xu laughed heartily, even asking her to sing another one. Old Chen turned sideways to look at Boss Qin, seeing him with an unhappy face, his eyebrows pulled tightly toward the bridge of his nose. So he replied to Old Xu:</p>
<p>"Okay, let's have another one!"</p>
<p>And cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"My lovely sister,</p>
<p>Pities her brother for not pitying him more!"</p>
<p>Just as he sang these two lines, suddenly someone in front of him搶着 sang:</p>
<p>"Brother,</p>
<p>Two or three days is not too much!"</p>
<p>Then the person laughed loudly, and at the same time, a large body emerged from the shade of a tree by the roadside, revealing a bronze-colored chest, with bright eyes shining on the newcomers. Beside him was a wooden stick. Old Chen and Old Xu were both startled, glancing at each other, and the interest and playfulness they had just had suddenly disappeared in front of this man. The man continued to laugh and said to Old Chen:</p>
<p>"Old brother, why aren't you singing? Sing... rest for a bit!"</p>
<p>"I don't sing well, how dare I embarrass myself in front of you, old brother?" Old Chen's wit immediately returned, and he said to Old Xu, "Okay, let's rest for a bit!" He understood that in front of some people who were difficult to provoke, he should try to seize any opportunity to speak as a friend. Immediately, he put down his bundle, using it as a stool to sit on, and took out his well-packed dry tobacco from his pocket, politely offering a stick to him.</p>
<h3>Faith and Eternal Life</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."</p>
<p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."</p>
<p>"...He that believeth not shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."</p>
<p>This is the most civilized explanation of the effects of faith. Besides propaganda, there's naturally intimidation in this harsh language. However, just "believe," and you will not encounter any more bad luck; all problems are resolved, making it very easy. In China, maintaining faith in gods cannot be so simple and careless. First, we are polytheistic, wanting to maintain intimate relationships with all sorts of gods, immortals, Buddhas, and ghosts, requiring much money, time, and a very strong memory. Second, we are "clan-oriented"; belief in gods will never be just for one's own eternal life, but also for ensuring that living and dead relatives are not subject to any suffering. That is, as long as one person in a family has faith, the others, even if they do wrong, will still attain eternal life. The Chinese nation is truly more generous, loving, and approachable.</p>
<p>I have an aunt who doesn't know what happiness is, but has continued to maintain her faith for thirty years, never once planning for herself. Her praying to gods and Buddhas is entirely for others. In the first ten years, she was still a young woman, doing gold thread embroidery by hand at home to supply the stage and temples; at that time, it was for her parents. In the next ten years, she prayed to gods for her husband, but her man—a customs clerk who later became a sedan chair carrier and finally a thief—died a grinding death under poverty, illness, and unemployment. Finally, for the most devout ten years, she gave it to her only son, who worked in a temporary bomb factory, injured his right eye and went blind, and was then dragged away during a raid, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>My aunt is a truly god-believing woman, completely different from those ordinary cunning and self-deceiving people who bribe gods. She remembers all the gods' birthdays perfectly, never neglecting or delaying anything related to worshipping gods, giving all the money she could to the gods and Buddhas for candles and incense oil, certainly observing several days of vegetarian or clear fasting each year, diligently making countless vows to those rulers of humanity, and detailing and sincerely reporting to the gods each time. During the long period of thirty years, she never did anything that profaned the gods.</p>
<p>One evening, I saw her saying this when praying to Heaven:</p>
<p>"...I have been reporting for thirty years, have the bodhisattvas heard me? Am I not sincere enough, or are my sins too heavy? Give me an answer, I have been pleading like this for thirty years..."</p>
<p>I paid attention to her actions and then discovered that she still did the same things to worship gods every day, but every night she would nag and question Heaven. To comfort her wavering pain, I said this:</p>
<p>"...So, it's all wasted! A bodhisattva will never answer a mortal."</p>
<p>"Quickly, don't commit sin, you've already offended too much! The answer of the bodhisattva is revealed in us people. If it weren't for my constant worship of the gods, I'm afraid I would have died long ago!"</p>
<p>She covered my mouth with her hand! And this was the first time I heard her care about herself.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to make something succeed by relying on knowledge. But it is very easy to hope through fantasy, regardless of whether it succeeds or not. When a clever person chooses between the two, he probably doesn't need to consider it much. A person who completely lacks knowledge has no way to consider it; besides relying on the knowledge of others, he can only rely on fantasy. Fantasy can cultivate greed, giving people endless hope that can never be caught up, which is terrible; it can also dilute people's sorrows, smoothing out scars that can serve as a memorial to struggle, turning them into a chaotic and senseless stubborn stone, which is even more terrible.</p>
<p>Because of social inheritance, human activity is already eternal!</p>
<h3>Dance Marathon</h3>
<p>— (By American J.T. Farrell) (4) Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>The "Dance Marathon" was held in a public dance hall in South Chicago. In the center of the dance hall was a circle, with a stage for music at one end. Around the circle were box seats, behind which was a row of white benches, one row higher than the other. The opening ceremony was described as a grand celebration in various advertisements. The announcer reported from the loudspeaker, and the tuxedo-clad sponsors and judges also spoke to the entire room. The contestants were introduced one by one, and several of them—but not Tex—spoke to the crowd and the national radio audience. This, to Tex, was a new and bright scene, although somewhat embarrassing. As he walked around the floor, he felt the same panic and discomfort as he did in the first few days of arriving in America. But this was leading him to heaven.</p>
<p>The competition officially began. The contestants danced for three minutes every ten minutes, and otherwise walked around the floor; every hour, they had fifteen minutes of rest. What a delightful sight! They were watched by so many people, eating their current sandwiches and drinking their current coffee, and being cared for by doctors and nurses, watching a group of people just like themselves all hoping to get five hundred dollars and a big name at the end of the competition. Whenever the contestants talked to each other, Tex heard them say one phrase over and over again—fame. Famous people are important, like Jack Dempsey and movie stars. All the contestants wanted to become a famous person, and so did Tex; he determined that he would definitely become famous.</p>
<p>Tex had never imagined that anyone could dance like this for more than a week, never imagined that he might have to spend a week of sleepless weariness to get the championship. In less than twenty turns, he felt that this business was even more difficult than he had expected. He gritted his teeth, determined not to be eliminated. But he also regretted joining this competition. He wished he could go back to the fruit shop and ice cream parlor to work, as he did before the difficult times came. He wished he could go back to the Greek mountains to be a shepherd, where his old mother had lived her whole life.</p>

<h3>Why are There So Many Chinese Students Studying Law and Politics?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, the education column of this newspaper published a statistical table of the number of Chinese students studying abroad and their majors in the past five years. From this table, we can see that in recent years, the trend of Chinese students studying abroad has shifted in two directions. One is that the number of students studying abroad has decreased year by year (with one or two years as exceptions). The other is that among the majors of students studying abroad, law and politics are the most popular. The former trend, although due to various reasons, undoubtedly cannot escape the impact of the economic downturn. This need not be mentioned. The latter trend is obviously a reflection of the belief of general students, fully illustrating how Chinese young students hope to have an opportunity to step into the political arena and show their talents.</p>
<p>Of course, the facts cannot be completely denied. Among these students studying law and politics abroad, there will be some who are deeply studying because of their personal interests. But among them, there are also a considerable number who admire vanity, covet wealth, and aim to become officials.</p>
<p>In China, becoming an official is indeed the most cost-effective. Not to mention high officials, even small officials have a status that is one level higher than ordinary people, and their career paths are more diverse. As long as you are flexible in your methods, it is very easy to climb up. Although unfortunately some fall down, generations of young people have seen through this. Therefore, they study law and politics abroad, regardless of whether they have interest or understanding in this field of study, and force themselves to choose it. They hope that when they return to China after completing their studies, they can obtain an official position to repay their ten years of hard work. This is the reason why there have always been so many Chinese students studying law and politics.</p>
<p>In fact, this mentality of students studying abroad is wrong. The mission of a student studying abroad is not just for himself, but for others. He should take his personal interests lightly and take the interests of society and the country seriously. Therefore, when he wants to study abroad, he must first observe the situation of his own country, see what the current society needs, and then consider his own abilities to work hard, so as to acquire what others have and make up for what he lacks, and provide a contribution to the society and the country. This is the duty of a student studying abroad. If he only takes his personal interests as a prerequisite, then why should society treat him with special consideration?</p>
<p>What China lacks today is various scientific knowledge and technology. To save China today, only science is most effective. Therefore, we sincerely hope that in the future, Chinese students studying abroad will change their previous inclination to study law and politics, and bring back more scientific knowledge and technology that China needs from abroad.</p>
<h3>The Season for Durian to Market</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>In the season when durian is on the market, the sun turns on a large wheel of golden flowers, spitting out endless heat into the middle of the mountains and waters. Thus: the warmth of the human world is boiling generally up. In the depths of some banyan and coconut groves, young people covet fire-like dreams and sentences, while old people fly in meditation to chase after the past, a burst of heat rushes relentlessly to the dry face that has lost the fullness of youth. Smiling, he turned his head to look at the crescent moon in the middle of the sky, which looked like the eyebrows of a pretty girl many years ago.</p>
<p>But now, time has deprived the human world of youth, "The good times have already been lost in old gray memories!"</p>
<p>Aren't images (images of the past, shimmering like gold!) as clear as yesterday? This sky (the azure sky, with three or five seagulls flying over the water surface), this dark and mysterious coconut grove, which is also regarded as the holy land of youth by young men and women, this golden and gentle crescent moon, this singing of young people夹in the tremors of a six-stringed lute (the black people's love songs with a strong cocoa and coconut flavor are like small dreams placed on彈簧條), this sea, this strong-tasting tobacco...</p>
<p>Walking east from the coconut grove, where young men are desperately coveting the rough six-stringed lute and the black laughter of tropical girls, people put seasonal and abundant durians on their stalls, and people buy them to exchange for the cherry-red smile of girls, and people laugh proudly: "It's the season for durian to come on the market again."</p>
<p>"It's the season for durian to come on the market again." What a wonderful dream this is, is it true that the good old days were just a dream that was not worth boasting about? - Who believes it?</p>
<p>(That's right, when I was young, I also had her cherry blossom-like smile, and the heat of the durian season?)</p>
<p>Still a child who knows nothing about shrinking back and fear - but now, even in the same coconut grove, I have become a safe and timid old man - in my youth, I loved the strong smell of tropical coconuts, the black flavor of the six-stringed lute, and the tropical girls who wore scarlet durian flowers and熏炙 people with a scary love.</p>
<p>But, I am a person who grew up in a water town, and endless days are all spent under the brown waves and the empty blue sky; I have a body that drifts like water flowers, and a heart that諷流 like the body.</p>
<p>So I carry this congenital drifting heart every day and float endlessly. Finally, on a day when the sun turned on a large golden flower, in a hot durian season, this ownerless wandering heart was dragged to this hot coconut grove by an unknowable fate and rested.</p>
<p>Like countless young people, when a worthless heart found a suitable owner - an owner with a cherry-colored smile, he also went to the market to buy durians that were on the market, bought a six-stringed lute that trembled people's hearts, and sang the wandering voice in a suitable coconut grove to his black lover: "Marry a wandering person - don't be afraid, I will come back, when the durian is on the market."</p>
<p>But what followed was endless wandering...)</p>
<p>The same durian, the same six-stringed lute, but my temples have already turned white.</p>
<p>Don't listen to other people's songs of youth, to a wanderer floating in the sea of life, this is just a kind of honest lie. I promised someone: "When the durian season comes, I will come back."</p>
<p>And now it is the durian season again...</p>
<h3>Things Under the Sun</h3>
<p>— Ling Zi Xi</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Grandma Changfu had just finished reciting her daily routine to the sun for thirty-six years, and as usual, she咕起 her wrinkled chin, as if she was still夹 eyeing at many curious and nosy "sharp-mouthed women," and獨偭兒咕起来: "Oh my, 呮呮呮, what a sin, doing this kind of thing under the clear and white sun! In broad daylight, her own man is sick in bed哼, but she is plainly drilling into the room with the shopkeeper! 偌, in the end, "洋塲" brought will not have good goods, all the strange appearances learned from the foreign women! 呮呎呮, a sin!"</p>
<p>So 嘰咕, Aunt Quan Gen's black "melon seed face" and short, sturdy body flashed before her eyes like a fish bone stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>The origin of Aunt Quan Gen was really a bit "unclear" in the eyes of the people in this village. Quan Gen's family originally didn't have much "property": a room and a half, in front of the door, in addition to the old man's grave, there were three or four points of vegetable land; besides that, there was only a semi-deaf old mother over seventy years old. Quan Gen himself was a "巴结" fellow, "light-handed and strong-footed," a man who could eat and do work: he was almost thirty years old, without a wife, but not at all promiscuous; he usually worked in a weaving factory in Shanghai, and it was rare to come back except during festivals, "Going around in Shanghai, such an honest young man is rare!" The people in the village would be strange if they didn't say that.</p>
<p>But in that year, a war broke out in Shanghai; Quan Gen's factory stopped work, and when he returned to the village, there was a black woman with a small stature, with nimble and unlazy hands and feet, two childish and frank eyes, curiously looking at people, and people also curiously looking at her.</p>
<p>Quan Gen told everyone that this was his own woman, "raised by the red and green flower sedan chair by means of a matchmaker and bowed in the hall," and then took the wedding certificate with big red characters to see the village chief, and the village chief did not say anything. So, everyone believed Quan Gen's words and called the woman "Aunt Quan Gen."</p>
<p>Aunt Quan Gen's behavior was strangely good, and most of the people in the village got along well with her, except for Grandma Changfu, who ate vegetarian food and practiced asceticism. The better people got along with Aunt Quan Gen, the more angry she was, and she just cursed at her后形 with Buddhist beads every day: "The one from the foreign 塲, what good kind is there, there is..."</p>
<p>But in less than three years, Grandma Changfu was very proud; because the words she cursed were actually fulfilled: for three years, Quan Gen could not find work,浪着, and suffered from a year of undead jaundice, and there was also an eighteen-month-old boy. The man was倒 in bed, but the family still had to find something to eat, so, after crying and crying, when there was really no way, Aunt Quan Gen got involved with the fat man who ran the rice shop in the town.</p>
<p>The first person to spread the news was Grandma Changfu, and when the needle-like sentences were conveyed to Quan Gen's ears, who was lying in bed, that night he beat the woman as if he was crazy. Aunt Quan Gen cried all night, and the next day, as soon as it dawned, she quietly opened the back door and jumped into the small river.</p>
<p>However, Grandma Changfu's pride was not easy to forget. After reciting "Amitabha" forty-nine times every morning, when she thought of Aunt Quan Gen, it was as if she felt a kind of glory, laughing, and 咕起來 like chanting Buddha: "I said long ago, will foreign also produce good kind? Under the big sun... no, under the big sun..."</p>
<h3>Spring at Stone Elder Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>It took a full two hours on the boat to finally reach Stone Elder Port; we jumped ashore, finally able to release the breath that had been constricted in our chests for so long. Fearing seasickness, I insisted on walking back; so when the boatman said, "Gentlemen, shall we wait here?", we simply waved him off to return on his own.</p>
<p>We walked through a village, winding through seven turns and eight bends, flanked on both sides by peach, apricot, and plum orchards; some were just budding, others were in full bloom, and still others had already withered and borne fruit. We walked along a narrow, gravelly path; I was wearing leather shoes, while Qing wore leather-soled shoes, so the discordant rhythm of our footsteps echoed beneath our feet, drawing curious glances from the local village women and girls. Reaching the foot of the mountain, a screen wall suddenly blocked our path; we turned past the screen wall and found a neatly paved mountain path, flanked by strangely shaped rocks with towering cliffs and overlapping peaks, and lush, verdant trees that blotted out the sky. Passing the Returning Cloud Cave, we admired the massive stone statue of the Child-Giving Guanyin; at the entrance of the cave was a couplet that vividly captured the charm of the place: "Thousands of layers of clouds at the mouth of Returning Cloud Cave, a single round moon over the bay of Bright Moon." Opposite the cave was a stone conch shell, said to be audible in Hangzhou when blown, but Qing blew it with all his might without producing any sound.</p>
<p>We stood before the Chastity Memorial Archway in front of the Martyrs' Shrine, gazing out at the tranquil surface of Tai Lake, with its vaguely visible mountains, except for the distinct features of Mount Moli.</p>
<p>Rushing into the temple, Qing knelt before Guanshiyin in the main hall and drew a divination stick, which turned out to be of middling fortune; at this, Ping lectured him like a pastor rebuking his flock, calling him childish.</p>
<p>The Come-Crane Pavilion was inscribed with calligraphy by many famous figures, including a large "Buddha" character penned by Emperor Qianlong himself: There was also a well-written couplet, but I can only recall the first line, "Where cranes once came, the pavilion remains ancient." At Lakeside Viewing Pavilion, Ping inscribed the date, his name, and the words "A trip everywhere" on the stone wall, and then we returned to Green Screen Abode to rest. After a short while, a monk presented us with fragrant tea, and we spent some time in Refreshing Autumn Studio, sipping tea and confiding in each other.</p>
<p>Qing climbed the cliffs, clinging to vines and branches, and gathered a handful of golden thread rhizome. Ping also wanted to climb the mountain, but his leather shoes made him slip and lose his footing, so he was stuck halfway up, neither able to ascend nor descend, feeling quite frightened; in the end, Qing had to help him down. Passing through the Sky Crack, we reached the Cloud Ladder, and we followed the steps back to the temple. Ping thanked the monk with a dollar for tea, and then we each stepped out of the temple gate with a light heart. On the return journey, we admired the many rural landscapes along the way, delighting in the simplicity of the village women and the innocence of the village children.</p>

<h3>What is "Vitamin"?</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>In recent newspaper advertisements, I often see many medicines advertised, claiming to contain a certain amount of "Vitamin A" or "Vitamin C," etc., and saying that these "vitamins" are so beneficial to people, and that taking them can promote human health. Seeing these words, I feel very confused: Are these "vitamins" medicines? Or are they foods? Are they beneficial to people? What is the difference between "Vitamin A" and "Vitamin C"? No one can give me a clear answer to these questions, so I have no choice but to ask you. However, will you find my questions too trivial and dislike me? Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shen Beifen</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Vitamin is a transliteration of the Western word "Vitamin": In the scientific community, it is often referred to as "vitality factor." This factor is a recently discovered new nutrient found in food. If we extract pure products of the so-called general nutrients in food, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and mix them in appropriate proportions to feed animals, it will definitely not allow the animals to fully develop. Therefore, we know that food still contains other elements that are indispensable for nutrition. Since this element has the ability to promote growth and development and resist specific diseases, it is named vitality factor. Currently, research has revealed six or seven types of vitality factors with different effects, the most important of which are the following five:</p>
<p>(1) Vitality Factor A (Vitamin)—Abundant in fish liver oil, milk fat, and egg yolk oil, but lacking in pork fat and vegetable fats. It is soluble in fat, so it is also called fat-soluble A. It is more resistant to heat, but easily destroyed by gasification at high temperatures. However, it can still exist when dried at low temperatures (40 degrees). It can prevent the occurrence of hemorrhagic diseases and has a special effect on resisting dry conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>(2) Vitality Factor B—Abundant in rice bran, but also found in other beans, grains, and vegetables. It is soluble in water, so it is also called water-soluble B. It has a stronger resistance to heat and chemicals, and is not affected by weak acids at 100 degrees, but its resistance to alkalinity is very strong. It has a special effect on resisting beriberi. Deficiency of this factor leads to weight loss.</p>
<p>(3) Vitality Factor C—Contained in vegetables and fruits, especially abundant in lemons, oranges, and tangerines. It is soluble in water and has very weak heat resistance, especially when oxygen is present, so it is easily lost during heating and cooking. It has a special effect on resisting scurvy.</p>
<p>(4) Vitality Factor D—Abundant in fish liver oil. It is soluble in fat and has strong heat resistance. It has a special effect on resisting rickets and can increase the human body's ability to resist tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5) Vitality Factor E—Exists in plants, especially abundant in wheat germ oil. It is soluble in fat. It is an essential element for the development and function of the gonads and has the power to resist male and female infertility.</p>

<h3>The Reason Why Gary Cooper Says Movie Stars Are Afraid of Meeting Reporters (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Renqin</p>
<p>You may admire a woman and like her very much, but you may not necessarily think of marrying her. Similarly, a woman may enjoy being out with you, but she may not dream of marrying you. When someone asks you if you want to marry her, if you say "No!" then you are simply a rude bastard, and it's too bad for the woman's face. If you say "Yes!" then you are either a liar or a fool. But how can reporters understand your dilemma?</p>
<p>When I got married, because my wife was not from the movie industry, I told the publicity department that if anyone came to interview me, please declare in advance that my marriage should not be mentioned in the conversation. The interviewer initially agreed, but as soon as he stepped into my dressing room, his attitude changed. They often asked, "How does your new wife compare to a certain lady you know?" This really made me angry, but I couldn't push him out. It is these reporters who do not keep their promises that I deeply fear.</p>
<p>Only three weeks after I got married, many reporters came to ask me for my opinions on marriage, etc. In fact, a person who has been married for fifty years may not necessarily understand anything about marriage. What should I say to answer them?</p>
<p>There is also one thing that can make movie actors tired of reporters. When you first enter the film industry, your knowledge is of course limited. Reporters come and ask you to say this and that. For the sake of prudence, you refuse, because you feel that many things are not convenient to say publicly. But they guarantee that they will never publish what you say. You believe them, and in the end, well, you tell them everything. Soon, your conversation is completely disclosed in the newspaper. You read it yourself and know that you have been fooled. They make you like a "gossipy woman." Slowly, people start writing letters asking, "Do you know who you are?"</p>
<p>There are many other things that reporters like to do. For example, a reporter asks you why you did something. You tell him. He replies that he doesn't understand. In order to make him understand your thoughts, you tell him many other related things, but those things are parts that you don't want to make public, but they are the most important parts, and the words that the reporter promised have already been forgotten.</p>
<p>Reporters also have a problem, which is that they come to interview you with a preconceived idea, and they can't make you say what they want you to say to fulfill their own intentions. For example, a reporter comes to ask you, when you eat eggs, do you like to eat the yolk or the white? When he asks, he already has a plan to make you say that you like to eat the white. If you also say that you like to eat the white, of course he feels that he has hit the mark and has nothing to say. However, if you prefer to eat the yolk, he will definitely interrupt you and say, "That's right, but do you believe..." Of course, you feel that it is inconvenient to argue with him too much, and besides, it is not a big deal, so you nod in agreement. If you indicate again that you still like the yolk, he will definitely interrupt again and say, "Didn't you just say..." This simply leaves you with no chance to speak. After the interview is published, everything he wanted to say is said through your mouth. Such unreasonable things are also common.</p>
<p>The above are only some of the reasons why movie stars fear reporters. When they reach the status of stars, their lives have to appear more luxurious than ordinary people. Cars, swimming pools, tennis courts, and hordes of servants are all related, but reporters can't manage that. They like to pick out a certain thing, a certain item, to criticize or speculate about you. When I have nothing to do, I like to wear old clothes and sit and lie down casually. The company told me that I should pay more attention to appearances in public. So I called a tailor to cut many suits for me. Just at that time, I came back from Europe, so rumors immediately spread that I had some kind of social attempt. I bought a new car, bought a new saddle, some very ordinary things, and if the outside world knew about it, it would cause many rumors.</p>
<p>When many stars gather together, their conversations often mention magazines, reporters, interviews, and other issues. I found that their opinions were largely the same as mine. We know the value of interviews and therefore value the interviewers. But we, like ordinary people, have many private things that we don't want to discuss publicly. But the more you don't want to talk about it, the more reporters want to discuss and investigate it.</p>
<p>In the end, I only have two paths to take. One path is to let them talk and let everyone treat me as a fool. The other path is to build a wall of self-defense and reject all reporters. Both have their drawbacks, but I have to take the second path. But I feel that I should first state my reasons. My reasons are also the reasons of my many friends and most movie practitioners. It's not that I'm arrogant, forgetful, or putting on airs, it's really that I'm forced to this point. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"</h3>
<p>— Zhaoren</p>
<p>Mystery of Edwin Drood—Great Shanghai</p>
<p>I really don't know how many times Dickens's works have been adapted into American movies.</p>
<p>Regarding him, in China, whether in literature or film, he should be a very familiar figure to readers. Especially this year, from "Oliver Twist" to "A Tale of Two Cities" that was recently released, people have a fairly clear understanding of him.</p>
<p>In the story of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", the original author consciously reveals the deceit of the choir saints hidden behind the divine slowness. It is a work depicting human nature, but people will cruelly criticize the change in the protagonist's character, and it cannot make people fully feel that he is a real person. The reason is that people cannot fully recognize the inevitability of his character change in the surrounding living environment, except for his infatuated unrequited love, it will not give people more empathy. Therefore, there are only twists and turns of the plot here, but this is similar to legends, with little real feeling. In the eyes of people in the 1930s, they probably wouldn't find this story very interesting.</p>
<p>This university work is being used as a detective film. The sense of smell of film merchants is indeed sensitive. However, what is gratifying is that the playwright and director fully maintain the flavor of literary films, whether in the composition of the picture or the atmosphere of the play. I dare to introduce to readers, if you have watched too many American horror films or detective films, then as a detective film, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" may not be able to satisfy you very much, but if you love literary films very much, from this film you will experience a special flavor of literature expressed on the screen.</p>
<p>I would like to talk a little about the performance techniques. At the beginning, the gentlemanly protagonist, after eating opium in a low house, his delirious screams are used to express his inner pain with superimposed faces. Until the church bell rang, he regained consciousness. Thanks to the efforts of the lead actor Claude Rains's performance and the excellence of the photography, the atmosphere of the opium den naturally exerts the unique skills of literary depiction of film. Similarly, in a graveyard scene, a befuddled old man, an unreasonable wild child, and an insidious gentleman, with different moods, subdued people's breathing in that quiet night. Also, on a night of wind and rain, the director wrote street lamps, children's chorus, changes in celestial phenomena, the gradual arrival of thunderstorms, until broken trees and broken windows. Here, people cannot directly see the protagonist killing his nephew, but this gives people a deep impression, so that after the murderer is discovered, the storm that time gives people a deep aftertaste.</p>
<p>In all aspects, whether it is music effects, photography, acting, or the set, it is a high degree of artistic expression. Especially the protagonist, although he does not have many scenes here, he maintains the same success as in "The Passionate Plumber". Indeed, we pay close attention to the acting skills of Claude Rains, who has just come from the stage. In "The Passionate Plumber", he is an evil lawyer, in "Juarez" he is a loyal intellectual, and now he is a skilled and vicious saint, and he has just the right performance. His advantage is not only that he can take on multifaceted roles, but mainly that he does not relax the scrutiny of human nature in any occasion. If he doesn't have a long history of acting experience, then it is a genius performance to be so calm and reach such a perfect degree.</p>
<p>Other people, such as Douglas Montgomery, had a good record in "Little Man, What Now?", and here he borrowed the youth and disguised himself as an old man. Also, the innocence of the girl Heather Angel... all make people feel the satisfaction of acting.</p>
<h3>"Carefree Gentleman" Premieres</h3>
<p>The fate of wanderers is bitter, but in their lives, they possess an upward-striving heart. Although they are constantly subjected to people's scorn and ridicule, they do not become despondent because of this. Therefore, the world has never lacked such people, and their jokes have never ceased for a single day.</p>
<p>In their miserable circumstances, they do not think of making people laugh. When people see them, they do not know why their mouths close. This laughter has different forms depending on people's hearts, including sneering laughter, warm laughter, bitter laughter, and maniacal laughter. However, they do not change their original posture because of this.</p>
<p>"Carefree Gentleman" surpasses other slapstick films precisely because it has profound meaning and is filled with emotions expressed through jest, laughter, anger, and scolding. Beyond the slapstick, there is endless sadness.</p>
<p>In addition to the two gentlemen, Han and Liu, a new actress, Miss Mei Lin, is introduced, who is worthy of the movie audiences' attention.</p>
<p>This film is scheduled to premiere at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre starting Friday.</p>
<h3>Several News Items from Lianhua</h3>
<p>In the film "National Style," there is a scene of the New Life Movement. Zheng Junli gives a lengthy speech. Because he speaks Cantonese, his colleagues who always thought he was from Shanghai only realized today that he is from Guangdong.</p>
<p>Han Langan from "Carefree Gentleman" returned from sweeping tombs, and Hua Jiqun asked him, "Old Han, are you back?" Old Han said, "Yes, I'm back. The ancestors didn't keep me!"</p>
<p>When filming "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River," Chen Yanyan wore a bright and moving wedding dress, and Li Zhuozhu deliberately asked her, "Yan, who are you marrying?" Without thinking, Yanyan said, "Luo Peng!" Only when everyone laughed upon hearing this did she realize she had been tricked by Zhuozhu.</p>
<p>Shang Guanwu doesn't know how to play the flute, and Li Keng knows even less. However, in "Tian Lun," Shang Guanwu taught Li Keng how to play the flute, and Li Keng played it quite well.</p>
<p>Sun Yu usually doesn't like to talk much. Recently, because he is writing the script for "The Admirable Crichton," he has almost only one thing to say to his colleagues every day, which is "See you tomorrow" after work.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Cloud Sky Regret - Part 5 (Living on Velvet)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>On their wedding day, Tuo Lei said to Ai Mei, "This matter is not proper. You will definitely regret it in the future. I am nothing. I am a worthless person. I despise humanity... I think humans are cruel, foolish, and vicious. I also have no friends because I don't want friends. I hate the world, and the world has no love for me. My life ended five years ago. I am living an inhuman life and will burden you in the future. After you marry me, you will not have a moment of peace... not a day of satisfaction..."</p>
<p>When Tuo Lei spoke, he was very serious, but Ai Mei listened with a smile on her face, as if his words had endless flavor. After he finished speaking, she sighed and said, "What wonderful things you say!"</p>
<p>After they got married, Ai Mei and Tuo Lei talked about family finances. Most of the conversation was done by Ai Mei alone. Tuo Lei listened blankly, as if he didn't care. He had no job and no savings, and the future was uncertain. All he knew was that he loved Ai Mei. What he liked was that he and Ai Mei were now actually husband and wife. As for tomorrow's affairs, of course, Tuo Lei Pike couldn't worry about them. Hua De was a very sincere friend. He had a small house in the countryside of Long Island, which he let them live in. The rent they paid was practically zero. This help was very useful when Tuo Lei couldn't find a job.</p>
<p>After Tuo Lei settled down in the countryside of Long Island, he went to New York every morning with other villagers. Sometimes, he didn't return until nine o'clock in the evening. But no matter what, he still couldn't find a job. Ai Mei's aunt Martha was very worried about him. She wanted to give her allowance to her, but she politely declined. Her marriage to Tuo Lei was for better or worse, and since she deeply loved Tuo Lei, she should suffer with him. Temporary poverty was not a problem. What she hoped was that Tuo Lei could be a little more conventional and a little more gentle in dealing with people.</p>
<p>She repeatedly told herself that he would slowly change. She hoped that one day, her love and his understanding would pull this unsympathetic person out of the gloomy clouds. But over time, she gradually realized her mistake. Tuo Lei was beyond redemption. He himself did not want to change. Hua De came to see them after a few days. He saw Ai Mei suffering from sorrow day by day, and wrinkles had already appeared at the corners of her mouth. He couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness.</p>
<p>Finally, Hua De thought of a way to help her without letting her know. He knew that Tuo Lei still had many worthless stocks. Hua De had some influence on the New York Stock Exchange. He sent Tuo Lei a telegram saying that his stock prices had suddenly soared. So, Tuo Lei sold all the stocks, selling them for ten thousand dollars. As a result, Ai Mei and Tuo Lei were overjoyed.</p>
<p>The next day, Ai Mei ran to New York to buy things—things she had longed for for a long time... some new furniture, soft carpets, and colorful curtains, etc., to make Tuo Lei's home look like a home. The two days she spent shopping in New York were the happiest two days she had had in a long time. At the end of the two days, she returned home exhausted. Unexpectedly, when she got home, she jumped. There were many workers in the backyard, busily working, and Tuo Lei was supervising. (To be continued)</p>
