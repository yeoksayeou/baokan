<p>時評</p>
<h3>英人出讓開灤煤礦之可能性</h3>
<p>— 磐</p>
<p>日昨報載華聯社束京電云。華北英國勢力中心之開灤媒礦。因受撫順媒山西煤之壓迫。及不景氣之　擊去歲媒礦及附帶事業虧。損約達四十萬元。且以日本勢力伸張於北寗綫一帶。將來更難謀事業之復興。據日報所傳。英國鑒於此種情勢。有將開灤煤礦及附屬事業之權益讓渡與日本。造成山英日二國共同經營事業之意日本方面因欲發展華北經濟。掌握秦皇島中心港之實權。故亦甚願接受此意。</p>
<p>開灤礦務局爲英商開平媒礦公司與我國灤州礦務公司合作後所組之管理機關。其合約之簽訂。猶在民國元年。今次東京各報所傳之開灤權益。據我人觀察。殆指英商開平媒礦公司之權益而言。開灤前途之可悲觀。其營業方面競爭及衰落之關係。尙在其次。最重要者。則自灤東淪爲戰區。礦區治安頗爲可慮。且工潮迭起。無澈底解决辦法。管理上之棘手。已達極點。設英國對華政策。在華北旣得權益方面。無加緊維護之措置。則此後維持灤礦之困難。必將更甚於今日。</p>
<p>此次開灤煤礦之讓渡消息。自日人傳出。或不免爲日方之片面希望。然衡情度勢。亦非絕無可能。蓋英人旣目睹蘇俄出售中東路之往事。又深受柳江煤礦糾紛之刺激。在日方今日餒重威脅之下。若不及早綢繆。則日後之損失將益不堪設想。設茲事果其體化。亦可謂爲英人對日退讓。而放棄華北旣得權益之進一步表現也。</p>

<h3>海軍問題　美日各有主張　太平洋局勢前途將有發展</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日據非正式消息、美國現正研究華盛頓海軍條約於一九三六年十二月三十一日滿期後、如何可在阿留申羣島、關島、及其他太平洋中美國屬島之設防問題、一般人預料美國對於保持太平洋中海軍優越勢力之决定、大概不久卽將有正式表示、惟目前國務院及海軍部雙方官員皆不願有何批評據倫敦電傳、美國大概將聲明、如英國放棄比率主義、則華盛頓條約中之不設防條欵亦必須放棄、美國竟有此要求、英國亦未必反對、並聞日本或非正式反對此事、但因日本本身已首先不欲遵從華府條約、當然不能正式抗議、據稱美國之决擬在太平洋諸島設防完全爲時勢變遷之關係、因日本實際上已破壞保障中國領土完整之九國公約云、以目前之趨勢觀之、太平洋局勢之前途、似將漸漸演進而成爲日美兩國之海軍競爭、美國方面尙有英國之海軍政策爲其後盾、惟英美海軍旣傾向合作、日本或將重新考慮其地位、若　、則一九三六年年底以前或有新海約成立之希望乎、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）據美報載、美政府因英國拋棄海軍比率主義、特於二十四日開會協議海軍最高方針之結果、决定拋棄比率主義、採用別種新方式、以期速成安全平等之原則、日海軍因未接公報、不願發表意見、然如此消息係事實、則日英美三國間之根本的障碍可以除去、自去年來在决裂狀態之軍縮會議、前途得一光明、同時英國計劃之今秋海軍軍縮正式會議可望實現、據日本海軍當局之意見、英國拋棄比率主義如係事實、殊可慶幸、然其代比率主義新方式老究竟爲何、尙不許樂觀、其外觀雖非比率主義、然其實質仍有比率主義原則之變態方式、亦未可知、日本主張撤廢之比率主義、須要名實具備之撤廢、日本所希望者爲最大軍備國之自動的軍備减少、否則比率主義雖被取消、並無效果也、（二十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>英外相霍爾表示　準備與美合作　維持意阿間之和平　羅馬繼續外交談判</h3>

<p>（羅馬）意國全境戰爭情緒今日繼續高升、軍隊開往東非、所經之處、人民皆麕集歡呼、至於阿比西尼亞方面、則阿王禁止舉行愛國之慶祝、今日歐洲各國首都咸乏非洲問題消息、大概各國皆在靜待七月二十九日之國聯行政院特別會議也（廿四日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此問仍有軍隊繼續開拔、羣衆沿途熱烈歡送、王儲畢蒙親王、頃在蒙德達城檢閱伽維那那師團步兵第三十一旅之第二營、按該師團爲最先奉令開往東菲者、現仍在陸續輸送中云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英外相宣布　禁運意阿軍火　比日對阿亦禁運</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相霍爾今日在下院聲稱我運往意國或阿國之英國軍火、暫不發給出口執照云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相霍爾今日在下院發表爲衆爭盼之軍火出口言論、謂對意對阿、英國暫不發給軍火輸出執照、但依據一九三零年八月二十一日條約第九條、運往阿國之軍火經過英國領土或英國保護地者、可准其通過云、路透社探悉英政府之地位、在繼續努力、以期成就圓桌會議、與意討論和平解决意阿爭議、但若此種努力竟無效果、則英政府對於軍火禁令問題、將與各國討論决之、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>法國表示態度　賴伐爾向政府報吿</h3>
<p>（巴黎）本日國務會議開會時、由總理兼外長賴伐爾報吿最近英法意阿四國政府因欲覓求一種方式、以和平解决意阿爭端所舉行之各項談判、賴伐爾繼指示法國在下星期內國聯會行政院開會時所當採取之態度、國務會議當加以核准、法國所當採取之態度、乃在多方設法、一面不損害對意國之友誼、一面亦無妨碍對英國之友誼、同時對於國聯會各項原則、仍加以信守、惟法國政府關於解决方案所當採取之立塲、並非硬性而一成不變者、賴伐爾啟稈赴日內瓦時、大約不至抱定一種成見、至國聯會行政院究定何日開會、則目前尙所未悉、此次行政院會議、係出英國方面之所期望、倘開會之前關係各方面能商得解决方法、則行政院卽無開會之必要、但此種希望、究屬過於突奇、殊鮮可能惟自最近意國政府向阿國提出照侖後、局勢已稍見改善、意相墨索里尼在照會內聲明疆界問題苟可以避免不談、第五中立仲裁委員苟可不加以指派、則一九二八年意阿條約所規定之和解稈序、卽可賡續採用、此在阿國皇帝、則以爲意阿兩國旣未能成立妥協、國聯會自當出而持平處理、如第五中立仲裁委員不克指派、則國聯會卽當依照盟約第十五條所規定之程序、就意阿爭端、作整個之討論、似此意阿雙方主張、雖屬不相融洽、但關於指派第五中立仲裁委員一層、或猶有妥協之可能、英法意阿四國政府間之談話、仍將繼續舉行、至行政院開會時爲止、將來行政院討論情形、可因四國間此項談判、而完全變更、本日賴伐爾並將接見英國駐法大使克拉克爵土、所有商談、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>厦門路西牢原址　將建火政大厦　經費一時尙雖措置惟原則上先予决定</h3>
<p>工部局董事會本月二十四日舉行例會時、曾决定在原則上、將厦門路西牢原址、規定作爲建築中央火政處之用、但建築式樣容積、以及他項房舍之蓋造等問題、則暫緩置議、並推舉卡奈·吉蘭利·及占部等一君、組織委員會調査火政處組織及經費等事宜、</p>
<p>建築計畫</p>
<p>査華德路監獄西人部份、不日即將建築工竣、旣有厦門路西半即將遷入、所遺舊屋以年久圯頽、即將拆除、因此火政處處長遂有在該址起造新厦、作爲中央總站之建議、並據火政處處辰之條陳將來總站完成之後、應有廣大之機器間、俾現有中央總站及天潼路新閘路等分站、均得體遷入、並於機器間之上建築宿舍住宅等八層作爲容納救火人員及其家屬之用、幷擬另築總辦公處一所、計共七層、內有特別機器間、以供裝置特種器械及救護車之用、並設警號開、電氣間、敎練室、及寄宿舍、等、此外復有工塲、貯藏室、及華員及其家屬宿舍等建築、</p>
<p>所需費用</p>
<p>此項計划、自經火政處處長、提出、警備委員會討論之後、工務虎處長當即提出意見、表示火政處之　備、發展過速、費用增加過鉅、若照火政處處長之計劃、各項房舍全部興築、所需費用達三百萬元之譜、而利息尙不在其內也、故依彼之主張、擬先建中央火政處大厦一所、其大小須兩倍於現有各站合計之總數、至其一切建築、悉待將來中央總站成立後再議、</p>
<p>非常發展</p>
<p>財政處處長亦覺火政處之設備、有非常發展之現象、並謂該處人員、是否可加以减縮、應加以調査云、而對於工務處處長之主張、則大致贊同、惟火政處處長則謂火政處之發達、似有過速之現象、但此實因該處效能、成立過遲之故、故彼對於工務處處長之主張、僅能一部份贊同云、</p>
<p>原則通過</p>
<p>原則依照火政處處長之計劃、中央火政處大厦一所、計共九層、共需建築費一百萬元、若上層宿舍住宅、數目可以减少、則貨用可省二十萬元之譜、此項計劃、據工務處處長之意見、尙不爲過奢、因現有各站、情形殊覺擁擠、將來新厦成立、各站一律遷入、可估新厦地位四分之三、而留待將來事務擴充之用者、亦僅四分之、也、但財務處處長則設此項重大開支、在本年度內、實無從籌措、並對於火政處費用之擴大、表示焦慮、深盼該處能力行减政、以資撙節云、當時主席即表示、在財政問題、當無把握之前、中央火政處建築細則、似無深切討論之必要、但以工務處處長顧預知厦門路西牢原址、將來作何用塲、以便從事設計之故、遂决定先在原則上規定、將該址劃作建築中央火政處之用、至其他一切則暫緩置議云、此項决定已由務委員會建議於董事會、山董事會表示同意矣、</p>

<h3>紀金梁烈婦</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>烈女，現代恐怕找不到吧。在數十年以前，社會上是常常可以聽到見到的。所以，在雜書筆記裏面，往往有烈女事實的紀載，這不是文人好事的筆墨，確是不磨的事實。在新道德未完成的今日，我以爲這些「忠」「孝」「節」「義」「勤」「儉」等舊道德，委實不應該打倒。蔣委員長提倡「新生活」，確是當今的急務呀。</p>
<p>在六七十年以前，吾鄉出了一個頂天立地的烈女，貞烈之風，足以照耀千秋。現在烈婦的墓，位在慈湖的北岸，邑人春秋二季去祭伊。我爲發揚潛德幽光起見，寫了出來，以愧當世沒有貞操的女人！</p>
<p>烈婦金梁氏，丈夫以捕魚爲業，久客外埠，終年不歸。伊的婆婆，是一個貫租珠花衣飾的女人，生性淫蕩，雖是孀婦，却和城中一個典肆夥計姘識。烈婦很不滿意伊婆婆的行爲，常常正言勸諫，婆婆那里肯聽。反而礙於媳婦的耳目，恐怕播揚開去，和自己的名譽有關。遂和伊的姦夫商量，想出一個「同流合汚」的方法。那姦夫聽了，非常喜歡，落得一箭雙鵰，享受艷福，於是不時向烈女百般誘惑，甘言蜜語來勾引伊。那知烈女艷如桃李，凜若冰霜，不但典夥討了一塲沒趣，受了一頓痛罵；連伊的婆婆都受了譏訕。伊的婆婆無計可施，惱羞成怒，起先還是用威逼的手段，依然沒有效力。後來竟把伊囚在地窖裏面，不時用熾紅的鐵鉗，在伊的下體亂燙。日久，下體焦爛，沒有完膚，慘痛號泣，聞者酸鼻，後來四鄰都抱不平，趁伊婆婆外出的當兒，羣入室中，打開地窖，見烈婦已不能行動，下體腐爛，慘不忍覩，便用榻昇至縣署，代爲伸寃。縣官大爲震怒，便把姦夫淫婦捉來，按律治罪。烈婦昇到縣裏，沒有說話，便香消玉隕了，邑人欽其節烈，便在北郭外慈湖之濱，爲烈婦埋骨之地，題「烈婦金梁氏之墓」數字云。</p>

<h3>靑蛙殆自黃山來</h3>
<p>— 姜丹書</p>
<p>讀七月八日本埠新聞，載着「浦東欽賜仰殿小浜內可怖一聲！一個大靑蛙，嚇煞許多鄉人，勇夫陳某捕捉，人心大定，四足放長約一尺，叫時如黃牛怒吼，聲振里許」等語，我非博物家，我更非動物界的偵探，但我可斷定此蛙來自徽州黃山或類似黃山這些地方，七不離八，有詩爲證！</p>
<p>纔見黃山面，居然學太眞，硃砂粒粒爽，流水時時新，帶起吳裝舞，耳　蛙鼓振，滌塵還滌慮，彷彿葛天民！</p>
<p>這是我去年今日遊黃山時在茅篷（紫雲庵）之下，洗過了溫泉浴後，口占的卽景歪詩。其中所謂「耳聞蛙鼓振」，是怎麼一回事呢？我們一到黃山，便料理洗生平所未曾洗過的溫泉浴，這溫泉是硃砂泉，不是硫黃泉，皮膚上所戚到的滋味，眞是難以言語形容，這時候，正當夕陽在山，淸風徐來，泉旁有一條大澗，當時正値大旱，澗中流水甚小，唯見亂石嶙岣，參錯有致，忽聞東起一聲宏莊的「鼓鼓」之饗，西起一聲宏莊的「鼓鼓」之響，正如上文所說牛吼的模樣，起初猜不到是什麽叫聲，我乃問我們在當地所僱的挑夫：這是什麽怪聲？他答道：蛙叫啊！問：蛀聲有這樣大麽？答：這是「岩蛙」，在此地是聽慣的！問：蛙在那兒？答：在岩洞裏。問：有多麼大？答：很大很大，比普通的田鷄要大幾倍呢！在這樣問答之中，不覺暝色漸合，月光忽開，「鼓鼓鼓鼓」，東唱西和，這一股勇氣勃勃之聲，眞足令人聞田雞而起舞：更足令人想到當年越王勾踐軾怒蛙而勵軍心的壯志。可惜今日的怒蛙，旣少人理睬，又不知自愛，也要趁着潮流到上海來一瞻紅塵，而又不知入境問俗，偏生先到半鄉下的浦東便上了岸，自難免要被那聞所未聞的工人認爲「野人頭」而拘留起來，性命交關了！倘使一來便到浦西，這宏壯的「鼓鼓」之聲，必與兜風的市虎，同聲相應，當不致遭此不幸。我想事實是這樣的，近來各處發大水，那澗裏的急湍，必一冲而至河，再冲而至江，三冲而四通八達，那隻遊興勃發的大靑蛙，也就流連忘返，乘長風而破萬里浪了！這大的蛙聲，不但浦東人沒有聽到過，卽好遊名山大川的我，也沒有在他處聽到過，且卽以黃山而論，宿在他寺的澗邊，也好像沒有聽到過。</p>

<h3>蘇州的救濟事業</h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>蘇州的救濟事業，在這不景氣的年頭，自從張一鵬朱貫一主持以後，救濟院隸屬下的各機關，却大爲整理，比了以前進步了許多。蘇州救濟院　屬下的慈善機關，共有養老所，感化習藝所，育嬰院，昌善局，聾啞學校等五所，至於閶門外的「苦兒院」，係地方人民所主辦，不在救濟院隸屬下的。</p>
<p>「養老所」，在山塘街下塘普濟橋堍，以前名「普濟堂」，係專收乞丐的。可是在以前的堂規，是十分寬鬆，乞丐出入，很是自由，正當些的，每天到街頭來喚甘蛆藥餅，蓬條油灰，技術是無人傳授的。可是現在，却大大改革了。養老人除了喚賣油灰，可以上街營業外，絕對的不容出外。裏面的設備，如衣，食，住，一者，都一切改善了，並且還敎授那班養老人，做鞋子，織毛巾，一切生利的營業，比了以前的「呌化普濟堂」，確乎今非昔比了。</p>
<p>救濟習藝所在婁門柏家巷內，屋字是廣大，淸潔；感化的人，分自費公費兩種，自費的，食，住兩端，比較舒適一些。那裏的感化人，每天從八時至下午三時，須輪流地上六節課程，別的時間，却是工作的時候了。那裏工作部分，有籐工部，炭基部，紡紗部，和木機部。寫經，園藝六種。是因人而設敎的，如文人寫經，農夫種田，各得其所。感化人工作之餘，也有娛樂，乒乓，和戶外運動，來調劑一日工作後的疲勞精神。</p>
<p>救濟院隸屬下的慈善機關，最爲生利的，當然要推棺柩寄頓的昌善局了。昌善局雖然也有一年幾元的公共寄柩所，然而普通的寄柩室，三柩一間的，每間每年，也要五十元，獨佔一室的，全年七十元。，昌善局房屋又那麼一衆多，於是一年間的收入欵項，是大有可觀了，據該堂報吿，半年之間，除去開支共計盈餘了二千多元，張院長見喪葬事業大可賺錢，於是又利用了昌善局棺柩入堂時那裏的三進大廳，粉刷一下，改爲殯儀館，可是這究竟是草創的事業，成立迄今，尙無人光臨交易哩！</p>
<p>育嬰院以前喚做育嬰堂，在婁門中由吉巷。那裏的嬰兒，當然是人家的棄兒了。院中嬰兒，分人乳哺育，和牛乳哺育兩部，假使有人願領出哺養，也可以的，每名嬰孩，每月貼還哺養費六元四角，那裏的小孩，一例睡在特製的藤牀裏，衣服食物，都用科學方法管理，嬰孩比了以前壽長多多了。那裏的嬰孩，如有人領作子女，以年齡大小定哺育費的多寡，每名是至少四元。</p>
<p>宋仙洲巷的聾啞學校，雖成立不久，然而那裏學生的成績，却很可觀，前幾天該校舉行畢業典禮，那三個學生對客揮毫，居然書畫俱佳。只此，該校的敎授成績確很可覜哩！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隱啼痕雖逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>李士廉道：介夫兄向來不說謊的，用不着證明。但不知藍專員到這裏有什麽任務。張介夫將放在茶几上的馬褂，向脇下一夾，抓了帽子，向頭上戴下去，雖是歪了大半邊，却也不理會。昂了頭向外面走着道：誰知道他是來幹什麼事的？不過據我理想着，在這裏總要躭擱十天半個月。他是個中央專員，若是能得者他的允許，向任何機關寫上一封八行，哼！一定希望不小。茶房，給我開房門，泡茶。說着那話時，聲，晋是非常的高昂。其實茶房早已開門泡茶了，他走進房去，李士廉也隨着跟了進房去。笑道：我剛才還同隔壁的程先生說呢。說是張先生的才具，實在比任何人高出一頭。和他同路到西安來的人，一絲一毫消息沒有，他可眼看有好差事到手了。張介夫昻着頭談笑道：我也不敢說就怎麽樣有才，運氣這東西，倒是隨人而定。若不是藍先生自己會來，我也能說找出路有把握呀。李士廉道：我是久已想請你喝一壺，有許多話要談談。明天藍專員來了，恐怕你是史沒有工夫，能不能這時同我出去，到小館子裏去來個一醉方休？介夫笑道：叨擾我就不敢當。李士廉笑道：說什麽話。自家兄弟，你擾我一頓，我擾你一頓，那都算不了什麼。你若是不賞光，你就說我是忘八蛋。張介夫還不會答復，門外已有個人笑了進來道：李先生怎麽承認是這東西呢！這句話的誤會，李士廉是難堪得可以的了。（二七五）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「旣已做了一省的撫台」，太后說道：「他的官階已很高很高的了；無論誰都自會尊敬着他，决不需要他自己再裝出什麼威勢來。尤其是他已做了朝庭的一方的代表，處處更應爲朝庭着想。他如其看到了這兩點，他就一定會很寬原地對付他的百姓了！假使當那老丐在他的儀仗之前衝過時，最適當方法就是敎他的家丁行得慢一些，讓那老丐平安過去；事後儘可再督責地方上的官吏差役，吩咐他們以後必須小心淸道。如其不讓他的家丁用鞭子去抽擊那老丐，也不止住他的儀仗，那末這老丐又必致爲馬隊所踏死，也非上策。這樣瑣碎的小事，他也不知臨機應變，怎樣能出去當什麽大員呢」？</p>
<p>第六條私自揑藏各方貢品的罪名，可說是最大的一條。實際上，舉發的人却不是廣東的百姓，而是該省的府道官員。因爲在專制時代，有一個習慣，不論在那一個地方，發現了什麽價彼極鉅，質料極美的希罕的東西之後；——或者是一方怎樣純凈明潔的翡翠玉石，或者祗是一對生得特別美麗些的錦鷄。。——當地的官府，就會費盡心力的去搜求得來，用爲孝敬皇上或皇太后的貢品。可是他們的官級太小，絕對不能直接的貢進大內來，因此所有的貢品，都得由各省的督撫大人代爲傳遞。（三七五）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市埸之逐鹿</h3>
<p>投機商一味購買　外商空額仍加碼</p>
<p>紗市異常錯雜、形勢絕其狂暴、多空兩方、皆有相當能力、惟多數投機商一味購買、因此波瀾甚大、遠月廠方稍有套出、至於外商空額非但不補、在遠期仍賣出加碼、據云銀行界亦在多頭地位、本月份爲最後一天、營業形成軋空、收盤價爲一百七十三元、比六月之一百六十二元、漲起十一元、聞交割數僅剩七白五十包、</p>
<p>本月紗抬價劇烈　標紗前市開盤、因市塲人氣熱烈、多說看漲、賡豐又來購買加碼、本月激漲二元八角、但拍至遠月漲力較薄、因有兩家紗廠在遠月套出、外商亦賣出、二盤忽落元外、拍至三盤、多頭仍在本月份抽緊、抬力愈强、遠月帶挺、收盤時市上傳言紛紜、某方面又來購買、檯面驟枯、市盤突跳一元以外、但現紗交易、因價高而轉冷澹、查在此上日中、逐步上漲、已漲十二元光景、査賣出吉豐一千五百包、達記一千七百五十包、昶記四百包、顧大五百五十包、元一一千五百包、益昶一千五百包、長豐二千七百包、協成五百包、生源五百五十包、永大七百包、買進益大七百五十包、錦昌六百五十包、泰興五百包、賡豐四千四百五十包、愼昌一千四百五十包、同豐八百包、愼記七百包、潤康一千四百包、大昶一千二百包、信誠六百五十包、德記八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉市亦有一番奮鬥</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲、但形勢雖俏利、然賣方亦有强力抵抗、不過紗市狂漲、致多方意態堅硬、本月份爲最後一天營業、聞交貨仍有一萬千餘担、內中有三千祖抽去不交解、收盤高峰爲三十五元五角、比六月之三十元零九角、漲起四元六角云、</p>
<p>多方準備收貨　標花前市開盤、本月份交貨尙有一萬担以外、塲中形勢稍鬆懈、跌角、遠月帶落二三角、拍至二盤、多方心意堅挺、市盤轉平定、三盤因紗市良好、買者益衆、且傳言孔多、謂通貨問題重提、市况陡然趨高、遠月跳起四角半、收盤、本月份多方準備收貨而漲、遠月亦隨之升騰、但局勢不若紗市之激烈、結果本月比上日收盤價漲二角半、遠漲五分至二角、査賣出吉豐二千担、裕大二千担、振大一千二百担、　昌三千担、元一一萬零八百担、義成二千担、泰昌三千担、益昶一千九百担、生源三千六百扣、新亨三千担、源與昌四千三百担、買淮同孚千二百担、穗隆一千六百担、合興三千六百担、賡豐三千四百担、均昶一一八百担、森康一千六百担、大昶二千担、永昌</p>
<p>千七百担、同和一千五百担、信誠四千担、益豐三千三百折、長和三千九百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉交易集中遠期</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因七月期最後了結、各月略跌三至七磅音、外商及廠家拋賣遠月、棉農亦有套售、政府賣出七月、散戶則移至遠月、外商賣出之主因、係參議院通過取銷出口津貼、午後有人補空、並有新買進、紐奧崙亦從事購進、彭克海新棉借欵之言·亦足引起大衆購買、收盤堅昂、計現貨漲十五磅音、期貨漲十一至十七磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌四至六點、印棉因多頭了結及期貨商賣出而疲、計平果爾跌一·二五至三羅比、奧姆辣跌二·五至五·七五羅比、白羅溪跌一·五羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>

<p>又據孟買電、二十五日四五月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百十六羅比、較上日收盤漲一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　東新粳昨已上市</h3>
<p>運到十餘石…專價十一元</p>
<p>本米（滬南）咋各帮來源略多、共到十七八號、市色因東新今已上市、人心頓時轉軟、結果各厚粳及薄稻等價均回落一二角、包胃有北平烟臺帮辦六七百包、陰變　未做開、至若東新昨已由周浦運到糙粳十三石、出白十一石半、米質尙稱潔白、售價因今庚以第一朝上市、故價頗俏、計售十一元、至（滬北）咋日河下各路來源七八號、市上各貨去胃白粳均屬滯細、價回落一二角、薄稻到稀銷平、價高定中次修削二角之譜、白元零拆沉寂、價小二三角不等、其餘各貨價亦小一角左右、</p>
<p>洋米　市本客去化仍活、尤以長江一路最爲活潑、漢口九江各帮被有整票付裝、且行家亦有自己付裝、長江各地災況甚大、此後需要更見旺暢、惟本市囤戶因價步高後、咋已隨市售出、新囤觀望、內地亦無暢胃、因此行情反見跌落三四分、全日開出西貢八千五百包、暹羅米一千包、多數爲九江辦去云、</p>
<h3>本月粉廠商逐步收回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市又見一致騰漲、因洋麥報價、芝加哥漲四五角至七角零、坎拿大漲二角零、開價時、本月份因北帮仍有生意、又以廠家籌碼、步有收回、形勢愈見緊軋、至遠期雖廠家仍有套出、不過外行人心、深恐白銀問題、一有變化、則物價勢必看高、故買氣亦頗暢旺、半日中交易已達四十餘萬包、彷彿人心之發動、正在邁進之中、查本月份爲日無幾、又須交割、照廠家自行收回而言、尙有繼好之勢也、結果本月份漲一分七厘半、八九月份漲一分七厘半、十月分漲二分、十一月份漲二分二厘半、十二月份漲二分云、</p>
<h3>麥市定中帶俏</h3>
<p>期麥市面、又見穩定、以洋麥報漲頗巨、日來現洋麥之兜售、一無活動、至國產小麥、均以內地行情未肯跌價、致販運商裏足不前、市面之穩、似爲事實所促成、此後如無洋麥傾銷、人心當鎭定有餘也、各盤交易、頗形旺暢、價則緩中帶俏、計本月份較漲一分、八月份至十一月份各較漲三分、現麥市面、已轉平定、以廠胃又寂、見交無多、惟交割已近、高貨恐須解入所中、故形勢反覺和緩、開高資麥三元三角七分、五河石脾麥三元四角二分、寳應麥三元四角、揚州麥三元三角八分、次三角、陸家浜麥三元三角七分、六合麥三元三角半、漢口麥三元三角七分、由福新去二千包、信大去五百包云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥</p>
<p>加拿大小麥</p>
<p>豆餅仍仗汕頭不帮維持</p>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、比較前市稍呈定局、原因上日暴漲三分、非實銷暢吒之故、所以人心立起變遷、幸汕頭帮對於期交餅、尙有問津、致市價尙屬相仿、惟客餅已露軟勢、統市計開各廠現餅三千六百餘片、期交餅二萬七千餘片、客餅四千餘片、黃荳亦隨餅市作進退、故市亦見漲定、廠胃尙有問津、本街等零星去路、續有走化、故行情暫　變化、共計做開車輪各荳有近萬包之譜、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶歐銷復暢</h3>
<p>珍眉爲綠茶中之主要貨品、因其佔全額十份之六七、目價値最高、其暢滯非常重要、前因匯價上落不定、華茶商索價過高、交易略形淸淡、昨市各歐莊因國外需求尙殷、內地來源不湧、進意轉趨濃厚、全市共由天裕恊和合中同孚等行、買進婺源屯溪歙縣玉山等路珍眉、共達一千二百餘箱、抽芯頂盤開出一百二十八元、市盤仍趨堅硬、針眉貢熙珠茶等項、交易亦不寂寞、惟低莊綠茶、去路依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產棉赤再漲一角</h3>
<p>國產正綿赤、昨市復緊、潮幫號衆、共開出一百數十包、價爲十一元二角、比前日又漲一角、公會劃盤、趨勢平定、二四粗砂白現貨及轉口貨均呌原價、未成、本廠綿白振裕一號仍十五元四角、二三四號照退、東白J嘜十六元四角半、N嘜十六元三角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新金菜地價回升</h3>
<p>新金針菜登塲以來、地價時見鬆落、茲以銷胃尙屬活動、而地價轉呈硬勢、廉價不易入手、昨聞已回好數角、後市似有續好之望、</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵皮奄無生氣</h3>
<p>白鐵皮新近市勢甚疲、客銷停頓、而廠家又無動辦、故市情呆滯、雖執貨同業竭力設法推銷、無奈水災匪禍遍地、且市上現金流動又屬困難、過於求、市勢異常軟弱、標準雖在連日外滙趨緊時、頗有欲漲不能之概、現市估價廿四號每担供售九元七角半、二十六號十元零七角半、二十八號十一元二角半、薄花色三七尺每張九角四五分、三六尺七角五六分、査連日交易祇有零星點綴云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>消暑閑話</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>大約是兩個月前，看了固劭先生的一篇呌做「詩話」的大文，因爲不同意於他的對於詩——尤其是袁子才的詩的理解，我曾經　本刋上寫過一篇文章，叫做「從詩與現實說起」，這篇文章發表以後不久，我因病回到鄉下，等到轉來上海，從朋友的日裏，知道周先生有過一篇答復，發表在靑光上，找來看時，原來那題目是「論詩尙曲」，問題是給拉遠了的。</p>
<p>周先生首先以爲我不曾細看他命題的章思，因爲他「論的是詩話，並不曾論及詩的只字一，是我給他牽强到詩上頭去的。但接着他說：</p>
<p>「鄙意以爲詩是孕育在胸臆，並非斤斤於文字上的推敲，字句上的推敲，如賈長江的三句兩年得，一哈雙淚流，適足以妨害詩的生命與進步，所以新詩就毅然主張放棄平仄格律以脫離舊詩的覊籠；這是我那篇小文的意思。」</p>
<p>這算是一個順手耳光，原來「小文」是也曾諭及詩的。不過我這裹得說句老實話，我只知道周先生　力地在推崇心靈，却不曾看出他還主張擺脫桎梏，及到現在再把那篇文章拿來看時，也依舊看不出，實在「無福」之至。</p>
<p>周先生借用隨園語句，非但未加出號，而且還有了削改，可見他原是要作爲自己的意見的。但這回可又聲明是隨園的東西了。個人的意見時，或有點出入，隨園自然也不能　。但引用的人竟至引出不重要的一面來，這就可見他原是了解不了的。</p>
<p>以下算是我的意見：</p>
<p>我曾經說過：「只有不蒙蔽　實，不曲解現實，而能盡量地採用現實的資料的，才是好詩。」放在眼前的語句，是說詩的好不好，並不是詩人不詩人。如果心靈派要把什麽一河水如呆立的棺一等等當作詩看，我是毫無辦法的；不過我却可以說，這並不是好詩。</p>
<p>杜甫好像是一個暴露詩人，然而他的詩並不全部都採用現實資料；李白雖然是惆「放浪於形骸之外」的酒糊塗，但他也有不蒙蔽現實的好詩。這是有待於讀者的深思的。要從隨園詩集里檢出好詩來，我以爲首先得選微漕嘆等以及許多寫景的作品，因爲這正是他重要的一面，這此詩篇偏偏又是和現實相連繋著的。他那心靈來潮時候的贈某郞某女詩，就决不是好貨色。我早已說過，隨園的倡言心靈，不過是作爲反對傳統思想的一種工具，和現在那些開倒車的心靈家，是不可同日而語的。洪亮吉說：「袁大令枚詩，如通天神狐，醉即露尾。」可以說是確論。</p>
<p>末後是要提到周先生這回命題的大意了。我從來不曾提倡過什麼直的文學，也根本不知道什麼是曲和直。如果那是說表演的方法上的隱和顯，正叙和側寫吧，那又完全是表演的方法問題，和現實心靈之類是毫無關係的。表現的方法可以因人而異，因事而異，因地而異。文不一定尙直，詩不定尙曲，曲叙的文，直叙的詩，也仍舊可以是好詩好文。</p>
<p>我這裏所說的好，是指詩文的本身及其效果而說的。肯講笑話，管閑事的詩文，在我看來未必就好，我相信好字的意義並不那樣不可捉摸。</p>
<p>這些都不免是閑活，借此消消暑的。倘使我因此只能算是一個文人，那末，我也無須去博取別人的佩服的。</p>
<h3>一對</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>濛濛的雨。夜已經是很深啦。馬路上沒有行人。一個巡捕突然從馬路的轉角上出現了。</p>
<p>骨挺的身子裹着一套新的藍制服，藍得在街燈下不時閃着光。皮鞋是怪響的。眼睛跟着皮鞋聲一路很神氣地溜過來。</p>
<p>他是愈走愈近了，他的眼睛已經溜到了站在階沿上的那位西裝靑年。在黑郁郁的夜氣下那個人正在用手指彈着那枝血紅的香烟灰呢。</p>
<p>他朝着那位西裝靑年走過去。他還沒有仔細打量對方的相貌，他就呌起來：</p>
<p>『你……』</p>
<p>『不，』那位西裝靑年狠狠地吸了一口姻，於是用大姆指轉動着無名指上的雪亮的戒子，又緩緩地說下去，「請你不要懷　我。我在這裹是等待一個十年前的朋友。』</p>
<p>「十年前，我和我的朋友時常在這裹起喝茶（他用大姆指向背後點點），從前這裹是呌做隆興茶樓，現在是改爲一半茶樓一半小食店了，我在日裹看過。」</p>
<p>「我和我的朋友一天到晚在一塊，我們談着怎樣可以過活，怎樣才不會餓。</p>
<p>『可是我們總是大天餓肚皮，於是就天天坐茶館或者天天跑馬路了。是的上無論在那裏我們决不會是一個人的。因爲我們窮，我們孤獨，我們相互就更需要安慰，更需要兩　擠做一塊。所以；別的朋友一看到我總老是呌我們是「一對！」這一對人又來了。』他笑起來，幾顆金牙齒閃礫着。</p>
<p>他又狠狠地把香烟屁股一抽，便丢到地上去抹抹嘴，他又說起來了：</p>
<p>「你沒有什麽事情吧？那不妨冉談談。有一次，那便是十年以前的今天，我是再沒有方法在這惆城市活下去，我决意要去跑碼頭，碰一碰我的運道。</p>
<p>「那也是他，棒我籌劃了一點盤費，雖然他是竭力反對我離開他。那天晚上我們還在那裏（他頭望望被細雨隔絕着的對面的店舖。）喝過酒，這個酒舖大概現在是已經關門了吧，我們直喝到酒舖打烊，那是半夜兩點鐘，我記的很淸楚。（他伸出左手，看一看手上的手錶。）喝了酒，我們就吿別了。我們當時就約定，十年以後這天，再在這裹相會，無論怎樣困難，必須設法見見面。此刻，（他又看一看手錶。）此刻是一點二十五分。他還沒有來。我猜想，只要他還在世上，他是會來的。當他看到我還活着，他一定會高興地呌着：「你，你還沒有死呀！」是的，只要他還活着，他是一定來的。」</p>
<p>『那未，這十年來你跑了一些什麼地方呢？』</p>
<p>『地方？各處都跑過，算起來倒也不少呢。天津，吉林，北平×××地方地方差不多都跑到了。』</p>
<p>『在這些地方你做了點什麽事業呢？』</p>
<p>『那多得很。茶業，菜館，最近還經營礦產事業。』他又把左手伸一伸，露出亮晶晶的那隻手錶來，時間已經快到一點四十分了。</p>
<p>『那未，你現在很得意吧？』巡捕這麽淡漢地問了一句，也不等對方回答就走了。</p>
<p>『是。』西裝靑年漫應着。用驕傲的目光送巡捕遠去，在那邊的一個轉角上他消滅了。</p>
<p>一會兒，巡捕轉彎的那個角上有一惆人飛奔過來。他也著了套西裝，外面還裹着一件黃色的雨衣。他一面奔着，一面大聲向着站在階沿上的西裝靑年叫喊：</p>
<p>『老灰！老灰！』</p>
<p>那惆被叫做老灰的也狂搖着手臂招呼他。他們見面了，很自然地互相緊緊握起手來。</p>
<p>『老灰，你倒還沒有死呀！』</p>
<p>『你呢？不是一樣也沒有死嗎！哈哈哈！』</p>
<p>『我們走罷！』他拉一拉老灰的袖子，又把手指揑一揑那衣袖的料子，笑起來，『猪玀，你一定行了高運罷，著這樣好的衣服。』</p>
<p>『哈哈哈！那是很便宜的！你呢？看你的身上不是也不壞嗎！』</p>
<p>他們走着，笑着。在夜雨中飄搖的兩條長長的影子尾隨着他們。</p>
<p>『我們到那裏去呢？』老灰問着。</p>
<p>『我已經預備好汽車了，再再走幾步，就在那轉角上，我呌他等着。今晚我一定要陪你去玩一玩花姑娘！』</p>
<p>『老九！不！』老灰忽然高呌起來，你不是老九！怎樣你的講話聲調會跟從變做兩樣的呢？你現在完全沒有故鄉的口氣！你不是老九！你一定不是老九！』</p>
<p>『怎麽？我講話的聲調？是，我的聲調已經變更了，那是因爲我現在凑的朋友都是外方人。』</p>
<p>『不！不！你一定不是老九！老九不會叫「花姑娘」，他是叫「荳腐肉」的，」</p>
<p>『是，到汽車裏我詳細跟你談吧！祇要五分鐘你就會明白。』</p>
<p>走進汽車。嘟！開走了。在靜靜的雨聲和汽車輪子的轉動聲中，那位裹着雨衣的西裝靑年揑着手指電燈讓他看這張條子：</p>
<p>『老灰：我正要說出「你，你還沒有死呀！」可是你的香姻一亮，我立刻認出你就是我所要我的人，我要找的人正跟你沒有兩樣。然而，一等到你說我們是「一對！」我不知怎麽的就不敢親自動手了，所以我叫這位老哥來。不過，你也許立即就沒有關係。請原諒我，我相信，我們仍舊是「一對！」老九。」</p>
<h3>兩個女性的型（中）</h3>
<p>— 齊吾文</p>
<p>車開時本下著微雨，雨漸下漸大了，車箱裏也滿着凉意，旅客們的談鋒似乎漸鈍了，有些已靠着椅子打肫。這位女伴也閉着眼睛假寐，但到了車停在中間站的時候，她總打開眼睛問我那是甚麽地方。</p>
<p>車終於過了新站了，大部分的旅客正忙着收拾行李和換上厚的衣服，這位女伴也把雨衣再披上並添上一條圍巾。我還是坐着不動。</p>
<p>『穿上一件衣服吧！外頭很凉呢。』她好意的向我說。</p>
<p>『不要緊。』我說。</p>
<p>『穿上一件吧。』這回她似乎命令着我了。</p>
<p>『我不覺得凉。』我沒有說出我沒有帶甚麼厚的衣服來，只有心裏謝謝她的好意。</p>
<p>下了車後，我會着那來接我的車的朋友，我們三惆人同出了站，我一眼暼見××旅館派來接車的夥伴，我指給她看，說聲再見，便跟我的朋友坐上別的旅館接客的車走了。</p>
<p>我上天津不下十回了，但總沒有在那兒停留過三天。我第一回在天津住了兩天，也就臥病了兩天，我不喜歡天津，這也許是一惆原因。說起天津來，本也不算壞，街道和建築物的齊整乾凈，現代的設　像別的大都會一樣，而且又沒有上海那樣的亂，那樣的鬧。可是，正因爲這個綠故，這個北方都會，便太平凡了，對於遊客們沒有甚麽刺戟，沒有甚麽吸引力。</p>
<p>我這回到天津來是爲看一惆久別的同學，這惆朋友，會有另外一個朋友說他太「洋氣」十足。車一停，我便看見他在月臺上站着，他的裝束又添了一點紳士氣：披的是一件鑲天鵝領的夾大衣，臂上掛着一根手杖，左手裏還拿着一雙手套。</p>
<p>我們到了旅館裏，談了一些別後的情况後，他帶笑的吿訴我說。。</p>
<p>『約瑟芬最近有信來，說她已經訂婚而且快要結婚了。』</p>
<p>約瑟芬是他的在法國的愛人，本有「婚嫁之約」可是他回到中國後，知道接她到中國來是一件不可能的事，而且他最近正然織着一個中國小姐。不過約瑟芬待他是太好了，約瑟芬一天還戀着他，他總覺得靈魂多了一點負担。</p>
<p>「你的負担可以卸下了吧，」我說。</p>
<p>「我送給她一點甚麽禮物好呢？」他笑了一笑，接着問。他對待女人周到的紳十氣又顯出來。</p>
<p>他在天津本來同時認識了雨惆女子：一惆是十七八歲的女學生，一惆是貴家小姐。當他徘徊於「熊掌與魚之間的時候，他也曾寫信呌我替他决斷，我回他一個「敬謝不敏」的信。後來他决定拿那貴家小姐做追求的對象的時候，我又給他潑了一盆冷水，可是他沒有生氣。</p>
<p>『你跟章小姐怎樣呢？』</p>
<p>『那是沒有甚麽大問題的，』他得意洋洋的答道，『章小姐是很諒解我的，成爲問題的就是她父親，他要我找到了職業才答應我們訂婚。你想見見她吧。』（未完）</p>
<h3>大學時代（三一）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>過一會之後我站了起來，走進大應裏去。這大廳比我所想像的更加陰暗了；靠近窗戶的樹似乎把枝條生到屋頂上去，我拿手杖敲着棹子，敲得高大的天花板都起了回聲；但沒有人來。—在左邊一個小房子裏我看一隻孤單的彈子枱放着。但在大廳底底另一面還有　惆門；我開了門，走進一條窄狹的過道，經過這過路又到了空地來。—在屋子附近一個地球塲旁邊，我發見個半老的人，腰圍一條綠色圍裙，在草地上睡覺。事實上這就是當年那惆僕歐啊！—當我用手杖去觸動他時候，他就睜聞眼睛，跳了起來。「對不起，先生！」他說，「昨天晚上我忙得很，沒有睡好。」</p>
<p>我驚訝地看着他。</p>
<p>「您不知道麽？」他繼續說，一面注視我，從頭看到足下。「大學生老爺們自從復活節後就把他們的俱樂部遷栘到道裹來了。」</p>
<p>我的確不知道，雖然我的朋友大多數都加入這個俱樂部裹面。</p>
<p>我吩咐了一瓶啤酒和一塊麵包，我們便走回大廳裹面去。——當陽光穿過打開的門照進來時候，我看見地板中央有好多黑色斑點，於是我無疑地知道：不僅俱樂部，速附屬於俱樂部的决鬥塲，也遷移到這幽靜地方來了。——『爲甚麼你們不把這血跡揩去呢？』我問。</p>
<p>『請你原諒，先生！』那惆蒼白面孔的僕歐回答，『但那些血跡揩掉了又現出來。這是那回不幸事件留下來的。——當那位熱烈的靑年先生那麽安靜那麽蒼白地死去時候，情形是很凄慘的。』</p>
<p>我立刻想起了那個事件，某個貧苦軍官遺下的寡婦把她的獨生子在這次事件中喪失了。這是我回家後不久的事情，這事回發生便引起這小地方全體人民同情了。</p>
<p>我走出大廳，坐在一隻綠色長凳上，心裏想着這個可憐的熱血少年；他的生命在這裏留下最後的不快意的痕跡。</p>
<p>過一會之後，僕歐把我吩咐的早餐送了來。『今天晚上，您還有好東西可以看到，』他說，一面把杯盤放在我面前棹子上；『我們這裏有跳舞會，老闆把他家裏的廚娘都要派到這裏來了。』</p>
<h3>「美國式的純客觀主義」</h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>在若多文學研究者中，有所謂「美國式的純客觀義者」存任。這些先生們不僅會寫關　文字理論和文學史的文章，而且還能編著大本人本的硏究文學的書籍但　們寫起文章或著起書來時，只是「客觀地」羅列許多作家的名字，作品及其生卒的時日，只是「客觀地」將歷史上許多有名文學研究者的意見並列出來，自己不加說明，不作判斷。譬如說，他們在寫一本「文學槪論」的書籍時，便是在各章各節中將居友，台恩，王爾德，托爾斯泰，蒲力　諾夫，……等的意見並舉出來，不作任何是非好壞的判斷，一切都讓「客觀去評價。所以，你在閱讀這樣「客觀的」「文學槪論」時，只是看到一條一條地寫着：台恩說……；托爾斯泰說……」，至於文學究竟是什麽！在文學上的若多問題究蟭如何解决，那是不能在這樣的著作中找到明確的解答的。</p>
<p>像這樣的沒有判斷的文學理諭著作，就表面看來，好像是很「客觀的」。但在實際上依然是包含着作者的最主要的「主觀」見解的，所謂「美國式的純客觀主義者」之一貫地以「純客觀」的態度去寫文章和編著書籍，便是其一貫的「主觀」意見的表現；而且，就在其「純客觀」的叙述中，往往也有意無意地表現出了他的「主觀的獨斷」。如專門羅列人名和書名的本間久雄的「歐洲近代文藝思潮論」，與夫他的堆領各家意見的「文學槪論」，據說就是很「客觀」的著作，但仔細看來，在本間久雄的那兩本書籍中，作者的人本主義的「主觀」見解仍是起着支配作用的。</p>
<p>唯其如此，在這樣的文學著作中，有許多的意見是互相衝突。（如台恩與王爾德、托爾斯泰與蒲力汗諾夫，其各自的文學意見，便是相互衝突的。），今「美國式的純客觀主義者」將這些互相衝突的意見堆在一起，不加判斷以集成書籍，這不僅表現了攸們的沒有辨別是非的知能，而且，其結果還是使眞理與謬誤混在一團，淆亂一般讀　的眼光，使之也不能認出是非眞僞。如果這樣的「純客觀」的著書怯是經作者的「主觀」贊許了的，那麽，其結果之使眞理與謬誤並存，是非莫辨。於此我們眞不能不讚歎一聲：所謂「美國式的純客觀主義」，眞是「黃絹幼婦，外孫齎臼」（絕妙好辭）我們只好不敢讚一辭了！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>墨索里尼勝敗兩難</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>意阿問題，現已入於嚴重階段，雙方旣各走極端，英法等國亦調解無效，是以不出一星期，有大戰開始之說，其事態之嚴重，可謂無以復加矣。</p>
<p>在此調人之中，英國最爲積極，因英在非洲，擁有很富庶之殖民地，而其他各國，在阿亦有相當的不少利益，萬一意國征眼河國，不免有利益衝突之概，倘使失敗，則英之屬地，亦有蠢動之虞，故英國對於意阿戰爭，最示劇烈之反對。</p>
<p>前日英內閣開會，討論意阿問題，聞已决定採取與國聯盟約完全和諧之政策，大約英政府將訓令駐意大使德魯蒙爵士，向意相墨索里尼說明兩點，（一）如意國戰勝，則有色人種，憤無可洩，足使時局愈呈惡化。（二）如意國失敗，則黑人戰勝白人，各殖民地民族均公然叛變，因此不論出於何種結果，英國深爲憂慮。</p>
<p>英國這樣的說明，業已開了天窗說亮話，眞是實情，但是此種說話，還是從英國立塲方面說，假定從意國的立塲說，就是假定意國戰勝，則因利害衝突，各國便要吃醋，萬一意國失敗，則有色人種爲黑種人所敗，白種人的臺怎樣坍得起。</p>
<p>但是墨索里尼，到了現在，已有騎虎難下之勢，扯足了篷，鼓足了勇氣，現在怎樣自己還可以收篷呢？幷且墨索里尼此次征阿，有三大目的：（一）意大利曾在阿國失過了風，現在正要去復九世之醫。（二）墨索里尼，數年來訓練了幾十萬大軍，耀武揚威，正可及鋒而試。（三）在歐洲大戰後，意國絕未得到德國屬地的利益，現在正可借此算倒扳賬（算　賬）。</p>
<p>但是算算意國這次征阿的結果，確眞勝敗兩難，其失敗非但一世英名，盡付流水，而意國的損失與國際間的變化，大有不能言喻的創痛，卽其勝利，則後面文章，恐亦多不少花樣也。</p>
<h3>塵居淸趣之二</h3>
<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>許多人都以爲在都市生活一定得不到絲毫的淸趣，其實，這是不正確的。上篇我已經把都市中的家居淸趣，簡略的寫下一些，現在我想再寫出一些都市中家居以外的淸趣罷。</p>
<p>摩天樓在目前已經成爲都市的徵象和骨幹，很多人看到這些水泥鋼骨的建築，就深惡而痛絕林語堂之流的『斗方名士」，其實他們完全不懂得什麽叫做趣味。</p>
<p>好像那些摩天樓我們且不必討論他的形式與綫條，在現代美學上的價値，我們只要在夕陽欲下的時候登臨絕頂看着都市中塵囂紛擾，釀成一片糢糊的景象，炊姻萬縷，織成氤氳的暮色，一個落日，因為烟霧的遮隔，反不刺眼而使人看得到他渾圓的實體，他漫漫的另外幾座摩天樓中間沉下去，這時候你蒼茫四顧，百感交集。前不見古人，後不見來者，念天地之悠悠，獨愴然而涕下。」</p>
<p>正當你沉入沉思中的時候，街頭五色年紅燈把你推醒，同時立刻把你引入另一個境界中；我不知道蒼茫的薄暮的朦朧一鞠眼到那裏去了，現在顯在的眼前的是明朗與溫暖，是美麗與淸華，俯頭下觀，馬路上接連的汽車水一樣的過去，李後主所謂「車如流水馬如龍，」這時你就得到了實感。假使是月圓時節，因爲你站得太高，任憑都市的燈光多麽明亮，如仰起頭來總可以看得到月亮，假使你眼睛好些，還是幾個窈窕的星星，向你閃眼哩。這時候你方纔的蒼茫的悲哀，一定釀得更深；『我欲乘風歸去，猶恐瓊樓玉宇，高處不勝寒。』一陣風來，輕寒襲袂，你方纔如夢初覺，威到自己已經站得很高了。</p>
<p>當然你强一些還可以支持一時，弱一些就一刻也不能停留了。</p>
<p>走下摩天樓已經夜深了，那時你千萬不要再走大街，你可以找幾條冷落的街走走，最好能找到一條不是光亮的柏油路，讓一陣風來吹起馬路上的塵沙，仰頭撲面，你蹣跚着脚走，寂寞的走過去；冷落的路上店家已經關門只有終夜營業的小酒樓，還開着你袋中只要略有幾文，就不妨上去呷他幾盅，座位自然要臨窗，人可不必多，你慢慢地一口一口呷，一方面從窗口中望出去；昏黃的街燈，無力的亮着，假使天公做美，特然下起微雨，那就更妙，陸游詩『疎燈微雨酒家楓，」只有眞正了解趣味的人才能了解這種悲愁的趣味。</p>
<p>自然這時候你的悲哀已經和陳了幾年的好酒一樣淡而有力，假使再不够，你不妨多坐一回，不出一句鐘，一定有一位瞎了眼的人，由一個小孩引着，冷落的彈着三弦，從酒樓下走過，那時你無論如何强硬也一定給悲哀打倒了。於是你給了錢，從酒樓上下來，踱到家中，倒起瓶裏的濃茶，呷到天亮，橫堅這夜是睡不着了。</p>
<p>上面所說的是正眞的都市趣味，雖則這趣味正是悲哀，但他的售永味决不像紙醉金迷的會使你厭倦，使你淺薄。</p>
<h3>旅途散記</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>接到了舅父病重底第二天早晨，天空飄拂着絲絲雨片，在我經騐中，氣候彷彿早已規定了似的，準沒有個晴天。在狹小的樓中，我開了電燈用我的早餐，一個錶好像突然患了積食症，他和我十幾年的相處，今天故意疏忽了牠責任；在四點鐘上牠是不能跑路了。但是現在决沒有這樣早，我打開了方框的小窗，昏暗的天空像一張哭喪臉，我的尖銳底觀察倒底分不出牠是什麽時候了。對於很早到車站去等候開車，我從來就沒有這樣做過。今天却要開始那種新的經騐，我跳上街車時，心里想着那個討厭的警察今天可以舒舒服服檢査我的行囊了。舅父病中，我到鄉下探望過三次，而每次都被那討厭的傢伙擾得我幾乎脫車。我以那個無聊的念頭湧到我心上的時候，我故意在車上把整理好了的行囊顚亂了，簡直分不淸一件襯件和一雙讓子。同時我心中打量着那雙吃不到油水的耗子，用牠尖銳的鼻想發現一點牠所需要的什麽之類，那情形挺可以敷衍過一點時刻的。再等牠把那堆零亂的物件傾回行囊，牠一定漲紅了臉，像一個爛熟的西瓜，或許牠要罵一聲『混蛋』—那個聲音一定並不像做錯了事被傳進經理室去似的要嚇了一跳，牠一定把聲音放得低低地，我或者要聽不出來，有如啞子吃了辣椒一樣。</p>
<p>車子在車站門前停住了，我先從車蓬中向月台上打量一眼，那個討厭傢伙果然是三個中間的一個。不過他今天　得更神氣了，那個臃腫的身材上更罩了襲雨衣，有如在報紙上看到要人一樣，他正利用他一對銳利的目光，像探海燈一樣從這邊照到那邊。我付車錢的時候，他彷徘是個首領，皮鞋跟上的馬蹄釘打着鋼琴鍵子似的從石級上滾下來，在</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>潮潤的空氣中，那聲音顯得那樣地嘹亮，我一夜未眠底枯澀的眼皮再不敢有神無氣地跌下來了，同時向天空吸足了兩肺空氣，挺起了胸脯想裝得勇敢一點。但是當和他並立着的時候，我幾乎差過他一個頭，我的行囊被他像提小雞一般的在石級上打開來。我打量着風勢不致把無情的雨片吹過來，打濕了我的行李，就從褲袋中掏出香姻燃了。當時也曾想授一枝給他，作爲第四次看顧我行囊的酬謝，但是沒有這個勇氣，幷且他要不要疑心我香姻中雜着麻醉劑倒是有口難分的。</p>
<p>車站上鐘樓整整打了八下，離開車時間還有八分鐘，於是我想起那只患病的錶，用一個醫生一樣的氣槪，請牠快跑了四個鐘點，然後放到耳朶聽牠開始辦公了才安心。一邊就注視着鐘樓，彷彿一個守着約會的情人，希望這八分鐘快一點過去，那許多脚夫的目光注意着我眞覺得太難爲情了。</p>
<p>在最後兩分鐘里，上火車的客人擁進來了，他們跳避上面打下來的雨點，又恐怕兩分里來不得打票，每惆人都顯得那樣愴惶，那個傢伙剛放棄了我的行囊想搜一個可得靠的人物來塡補他的徒勞無功。但是我也預備上車了，在兩分鐘里足够我買票，上車找一個坐位的時間我要趕我的旅途了。</p>
<h3>黃素盒先生高弟</h3>
<p>— 張文儀作品（年僅十四歲）</p>
<h3>雨行</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>懷着一顆茫然的心，悵惘地踏上了拂曉的街頭，晨風是習習地向身上撲來，細雨却霏霏地在天空中飄着，街中是像死一般的靜寂！</p>
<p>在碼頭上，我是那麼驕傲的站在許多孩子的中間；望望身邊那隻靜靜地躺着的行篋，心里感到有些茫然：</p>
<p>—孩子們呵，我這一次會突然地離開你們，可以說是一個意外；但是我不久還是要回來的啊！</p>
<p>這時，在我的週遭是沒有虛偽，沒有厭惡，全是些天眞的眼睛和無邪的笑語；但是我將要在這立刻以後，和這些小天使們分別了。我有些悵惘，我有些悲哀！然而再一想到我此去是去奔赴自已的光榮的前程的時候，就有一個興奮的意念襲上了心頭。</p>
<p>—先生你去了幾時回來？我們將天天晚晚的要盼望着你回來哩！</p>
<p>英兒的話像警鐘一般的撞在我的心上，使我有些躊躇回答不出來。</p>
<p>—呵！你們等着吧！大約不出荔枝花開的季節。</p>
<p>我忍着熱淚，勉强地回答了這樣一句。但荔枝花開的時候我果眞會回來嗎？如果到了那時我不能回來，這使他們將怎樣的盼望呢！假使盼我不回來的時候，又將怎樣的使他們失望呵！啊！我欺騙了這些天眞的孩子。</p>
<p>—現在離開荔枝花開的時候還有半年多呢；這日子是多麽地悠長啊！先生，你不好早些回來嗎？</p>
<p>明兒有些瑩塋欲淚了：他用一雙小手牽住了我的衣角，彷彿怕我振翼飛去似的。我用手撫摩着他柔軟的頭髪，俯下首去，輕輕的在他額上吻着，吻着。</p>
<p>—先生，你回來的時候一定要多帶些好聽的故事來。</p>
<p>小倩依然是那麽活潑地在我面前跳着，要求我帶些故事來；我漫然地向她點點頭。</p>
<p>我這時眞想哭，但在這羣孩子的面前却不敢哭出來；看見他們十多對小眼睛都緊緊地向我臉上釘着，使得我不再有勇氣向他們望一下；我慚愧，我痛苦，我有許多話語要吿訴他們，但每次剛剛吐到嘴邊，它就滑了回去。我靜默，他們也靜默，在我們之間只有讓那無涯的靜穆來統治着了。</p>
<p>細雨依舊是無休止的在飄着，碼頭上的許多槓役搬佚，都忙碌地在搬運貨物行李，來乘船的旅客也慢慢兒的擠起來了。我看看腕上的手表，知道離開啟椗的鐘點不遠了；於是我勉强對他們安慰着說：</p>
<p>—回來的，一定回來的：我至少也得常常回來看你們的。現在雨下得大了，你們快回家去吧！</p>
<p>但是他們沒有走，還是癡癡地圍在我身邊，在他們每一對小眼睛里，全貯滿着熱情的眞摯的淚泉。</p>
<p>汽笛嗚嗚的吼叫了三聲，我下意識地提起了行篋，彷彿逃犯般的逃進了艙里，就倒在自己舖位上哭了起來。這時我盡情的哭，豪放的哭，把一個積壓一個多鐘頭的鬱壩都開放了，也顧不得船上的茶房乘客對我驚異的更想不到這一羣孩子有沒有回去？</p>
<p>又鳴了一次汽笛，船身就蠕蠕地動了，我從舖上驚醒過來，拭拭乾眼淚，從圓窗洞中望出去，看見這一羣天眞的孩子仍舊癡癡地站在碼頭上，對這隻輪船望着，我於是就一口氣奔上了甲板，站在欄杆邊，從袋里抽出一方手帕，向他們揚着，揚着，他們也各人舉起一支小胳臂來，向我搖幌着，我是用手帕向他們揮揮，臉上却浮起了一堆不自然的苦笑！</p>
<p>船行增加了速率，他們這一羣的影子便飛快的在我眼睛里消逝，不多時，連碼頭的屋尖也望不見了。</p>
<p>我一步一步的從扶梯上挨下去，走回了艙里，向自家兒舖上一躺，覺得精神很疲憊，要想靜靜的休息一下；但蜷伏在舖角落里，剛一合上眼，那十幾對小眼睛和十多隻小面孔却都很淸晰的在我眼前閃映了—有時彷彿在園里敎他們體操，而有時却好像在課堂里替他們上課。我不能睡，我不願睡，暴躁的從舖上跳了起來，然而一個頭眩不覺又倒了下去，我將首埋在被窩里，想把神經鎭靜一下，但感到船身震動得很厲害。坐起身，推開了窗向外面一望，纔知道船已航行在洋面上了。</p>
<p>雨，似乎比早上緊密了，海面上彷彿給散上了一層濃霧，週遭是糢糊的，遠處的姻波都望不到一絲影兒的祇有雨的聲音在船面上暄鬧若，和波濤的澎湃聲合奏成了海的交響樂。</p>

<h3>The Possibility of the British Ceding the Kailuan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>— Pan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the report in the press stated that the Chinese United News Agency's Tokyo dispatch stated that the Kailuan Coal Mine, the center of British power in North China, had suffered losses of approximately 400,000 yuan last year due to pressure from the Fushun and Shanxi Coal Mines, as well as the impact of the economic downturn. Furthermore, with the expansion of Japanese power in the Beining Line area, it will be even more difficult to seek the revitalization of the business in the future. According to reports in Japanese newspapers, the British, in light of this situation, intend to cede the rights and interests of the Kailuan Coal Mine and its affiliated businesses to Japan, creating a joint venture between Shan, British, and Japanese companies. Japan is very willing to accept this idea because it wants to develop the North China economy and control the Qin Huangdao central port.</p>
<p>The Kailuan Mining Bureau is a management organization formed after the cooperation between the British-owned Kaiping Coal Mining Company and the Chinese-owned Luanzhou Mining Company. The contract was signed as early as the first year of the Republic of China. The Kailuan rights and interests mentioned in the Tokyo newspapers this time, according to our observation, most likely refer to the rights and interests of the British-owned Kaiping Coal Mining Company. The pessimistic outlook for Kailuan is due not only to competition and decline in its business operations, but more importantly, since LuanDong fell into a war zone, the security of the mining area has been quite concerning. Furthermore, there have been repeated labor strikes, with no thorough solution. The management difficulties have reached an extreme point. If the British policy towards China does not include measures to strengthen the protection of vested interests in North China, then the difficulty of maintaining the Luan Mine in the future will inevitably be even greater than it is today.</p>
<p>The news of the transfer of the Kailuan Coal Mine came from the Japanese. It may be merely a one-sided hope on the part of the Japanese, but considering the situation, it is not entirely impossible. Having witnessed the past event of the Soviet Union selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, and deeply affected by the Liujiang Coal Mine dispute, under the current heavy threat from Japan, if measures are not taken early, the future losses will be even more unimaginable. If this matter is indeed realized, it can be said to be a further manifestation of the British conceding to Japan and abandoning their vested interests in North China.</p>

<h3>Report on River Water Levels Along the Yangtze River</h3>

<h3>Cases of Punishment Under the Shipping Law Are Generally Handled by the Courts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of special fines for violations of the Shipping Law, the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Justice had previously agreed that, as it was an administrative fine, it should be handled by the competent maritime administration agency. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice stipulated that violations of the provisions of Article 232 of the Company Law should be tried and fined by the courts. Since the provisions of that article also involved special fines, with one law being handled by the courts and the other by the competent agency, the difference in treatment was not a way to respect the rights of the people. The result of the current meeting is that future cases of punishment under the Shipping Law will be handled by the courts to achieve uniformity, and a report will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, and a consultation will be sent by the Ministry of Finance to the supervisors of all customs offices to comply with it.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Government Affairs: Proceeding Strictly According to Established Rules</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi met with reporters on the morning of the 25th and discussed the current acting President's efforts in flood relief for the Jiang and He rivers and important national financial measures. Kong first stated that President Wang had shouldered the heavy responsibilities of the nation for the past three years, and in the past two or three months, his responsibilities had been particularly heavy, causing his old illness to recur. He went to Shanghai for treatment, but after more than a month without recovery, he went to Qingdao for recuperation. We are deeply respectful for his dedication to the country, which damaged his personal health. President Wang had repeatedly instructed me to act on his behalf in handling government affairs and presiding over cabinet meetings. Now, the Central Government believes that Wang's accumulated labor has led to illness, and his condition still requires two or three weeks of rest before he can recover. However, the Executive Yuan is the central hub of national government affairs and cannot be without a formally responsible person for even a day. Therefore, it was decided to have me act on his behalf in accordance with the law. This is merely a legal formality. I am already overwhelmed by handling the affairs of the Ministry of Finance, the National Economic Council, and the Central Bank. Now, taking on the additional responsibilities of the Executive Yuan will be mentally taxing. I hope that Wang can recover his health after the Beginning of Autumn (立秋) and return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over government affairs. As for the affairs of the Executive Yuan, during my acting period, they will be conducted in accordance with established rules. Kong continued, saying that this year's Jiang and He river floods have caused severe disasters in various regions, and relief is urgently needed. The Central Government previously formulated the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, which stipulated that both the central and local governments must allocate and store disaster relief reserve funds annually. In the event of a major disaster that cannot be relieved by the city or county, it should be subsidized by the provincial disaster relief reserve fund, and if that is insufficient, it should be subsidized by the central disaster relief reserve fund. Outsiders who do not understand the contents of the law have many misunderstandings. The central government has already allocated 2 million for this year's central disaster relief reserve fund, but based on the current disaster situation, it is feared that it will be insufficient. Efforts are currently being made to find ways to raise funds. As for the amount of funds required for future disaster relief and how they will be allocated, it must be determined after the provinces have submitted reports and they have been verified. Hubei Province has requested an initial allocation of 5 million, which is currently under review. Finally, when reporters asked about the current important national financial measures and the situation in Sichuan and Chahar provinces, Kong replied that the central government has made a resolution to reduce transit export taxes in order to relieve industry and commerce. Except for the abolition of transit export taxes, which has been delayed due to the compensatory measures not yet being properly arranged, the reduction and exemption of export tax tariffs and types have been formulated and announced and can be implemented at any time. The reorganization of Sichuan's finances and the establishment of a unified tax system in Sichuan have been discussed with Liu Hangchen and Guan Jiyu from the province, and a result has been agreed upon. Liu and Guan will return to Sichuan to start implementing it. Chairman Qin Dechun of Chahar is currently staying in Tianjin, discussing and resolving the remaining issues in Chahar Province and will return to Chahar soon to resume his duties.

<h3>Naval Issues: The United States and Japan Have Different Views; The Future of the Pacific Situation Will Develop</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to informal news today, the United States is currently studying how the Washington Naval Treaty can address the fortification of the Aleutian Islands, Guam, and other American-owned islands in the Pacific Ocean after it expires on December 31, 1936. It is generally expected that the United States will soon make a formal statement on its determination to maintain naval supremacy in the Pacific. However, officials from both the State Department and the Navy Department are currently unwilling to comment. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the United States will likely declare that if Britain abandons the ratio system, the non-fortification clauses in the Washington Treaty must also be abandoned. Britain may not oppose this request from the United States. It is also reported that Japan may unofficially oppose this, but because Japan itself has been the first to disobey the Washington Treaty, it cannot officially protest. It is said that the US decision to fortify the islands in the Pacific is entirely due to changing circumstances, as Japan has effectively violated the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity. Judging from the current trend, the future of the Pacific situation seems to be gradually evolving into a naval competition between Japan and the United States. The United States also has the British naval policy as its backing. However, with British and American navies tending to cooperate, Japan may reconsider its position. If so, there may be hope for a new naval treaty to be established before the end of 1936. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to American newspapers, the US government held a meeting on the 24th to discuss the highest naval policy due to Britain's abandonment of the naval ratio system. As a result, it decided to abandon the ratio system and adopt other new methods in order to quickly achieve the principles of security and equality. The Japanese Navy is unwilling to express its views because it has not received an official announcement. However, if this news is true, the fundamental obstacles between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States can be removed. The future of the disarmament conference, which has been in a state of rupture since last year, has brightened. At the same time, the formal naval disarmament conference planned by Britain this autumn is expected to be realized. According to the opinion of the Japanese naval authorities, it is gratifying if Britain abandons the ratio system. However, it is not yet possible to be optimistic about what the new method replacing the ratio system will be. Its appearance may not be the ratio system, but its essence may still be a modified version of the ratio system principle. The ratio system that Japan advocates for abolishing must be truly abolished in name and in fact. What Japan hopes for is the automatic reduction of armaments by the largest military powers. Otherwise, even if the ratio system is abolished, there will be no effect. (Japan Federation Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Hoare Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with the United States to Maintain Peace Between Italy and Abyssinia; Rome Continues Diplomatic Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare declared to the House of Commons today that Britain has always been prepared to cooperate with the United States in maintaining peace. This statement by the Foreign Secretary was in response to a question from the House of Commons as to whether Britain and the United States are seeking to adopt a common policy on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Hoare also stated that he had assured American Ambassador to Britain Bingham that the British government was fully satisfied with US Secretary of State Hull's description of the responsibilities of the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, Hoare refused to state in advance what actions the British government would take if Italy and Abyssinia formally went to war. After the King of Abyssinia requested the United States to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact to intervene in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Hull replied to Abyssinia that he was unwilling to intervene. Therefore, there has been much criticism of the United States' failure to implement the pact. The British Foreign Secretary's remarks today regarding Hull's discussion of the issue of responsibility are generally considered to be quite important. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures are now reconsidering the possibility of closing the Suez Canal in the event of a war between Italy and Abyssinia.

In addition, the governments of the three countries are making final efforts to peacefully resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Continues to Send Troops to East Africa; National War Sentiment Rises</h3>
<p>(Rome) The war sentiment throughout Italy continued to rise today. Troops were sent to East Africa, and people gathered and cheered along the way. As for Abyssinia, the King of Abyssinia has banned patriotic celebrations. Today, news about the African issue is scarce in various European capitals. It is likely that all countries are quietly awaiting the special meeting of the Council of the League of Nations on July 29. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces Arms Embargo on Italy and Abyssinia, Japan Also Imposes Embargo on Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Hoare stated in the House of Commons today that British military supplies destined for Italy or Abyssinia will not be issued export licenses for the time being. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Hoare today made a long-awaited statement in the House of Commons regarding the export of arms, saying that Britain will temporarily not issue export licenses for arms to Italy and Abyssinia. However, according to Article 9 of the treaty of August 21, 1930, military supplies destined for Abyssinia that pass through British territory or British protectorates may be allowed to pass. Reuters has learned that the British government's position is to continue its efforts to achieve a round table conference and discuss a peaceful resolution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. However, if these efforts are unsuccessful, the British government will discuss the issue of arms embargoes with other countries to reach a decision. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>France Expresses Its Attitude: Laval Reports to the Government</h3>
<p>(Paris) At today's State Council meeting, Premier and Foreign Minister Laval reported on the recent negotiations among the governments of Britain, France, Italy, and Abyssinia to seek a way to peacefully resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Laval then outlined the attitude that France should adopt when the League of Nations Council convenes next week, which the State Council approved. The attitude France should adopt is to try in many ways to avoid harming its friendship with Italy and its friendship with Britain, while also adhering to the principles of the League of Nations. However, the French government's position on solutions is not rigid and unchangeable. Laval will likely not hold a fixed preconception when he leaves for Geneva. The date of the League of Nations Council meeting is currently unknown. This Council meeting is at the urging of the British side. If the parties concerned can agree on a solution before the meeting, then there is no need for the Council to meet. However, this hope is rather unexpected and unlikely. Since the Italian government recently sent a note to Abyssinia, the situation has improved slightly. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated in the note that if the border issue could be avoided and the fifth neutral arbitrator did not have to be appointed, then the reconciliation process stipulated in the 1928 Italo-Abyssinian treaty could continue. The Abyssinian Emperor believes that since Italy and Abyssinia have failed to reach a compromise, the League of Nations should step in to handle the matter impartially. If the fifth neutral arbitrator cannot be appointed, then the League of Nations should, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 15 of the Covenant, conduct a full discussion of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Although the positions of Italy and Abyssinia are incompatible, there may still be room for compromise on the appointment of the fifth neutral arbitrator. Talks between the governments of Britain, France, Italy, and Abyssinia will continue until the Council meeting. The circumstances of the Council's discussion may change completely due to these talks between the four countries. Today, Laval will also meet with British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk. All matters will be discussed. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Meeting at End of Month: Britain and France Still Disagree on Policy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Due to the inability to appoint the fifth arbitrator in a timely manner, it is expected that the League of Nations Council meeting to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will be convened on July 31. Britain and France have not yet agreed on the policy to be adopted by the Council. The French government still hopes that the discussion will be limited to the border conflict issue and that the fifth arbitrator can be appointed, so that the consideration of the overall case can be postponed to late August. However, according to various sources, Britain will be prepared to deal with a frank discussion of the whole problem and to follow the natural path of Abyssinia's petition in accordance with Article 15 of the League Covenant. It is expected that Britain's position will be supported by the Little Entente, the Balkan Entente, and the majority of the League of Nations members. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Laval and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol have agreed that the League of Nations Council will meet next week to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Avenol will notify Council Chairman Litvinov by telephone after returning to Geneva to determine the definite date of the meeting. It is predicted that the meeting will likely be held on July 30 or 31, and that the debate will not extend to August 3. Unless special circumstances arise, Laval will personally lead the French delegation to the meeting. Litvinov is expected to arrive here today. Litvinov will consult with Laval on all matters before going to Geneva. It is unanimously hoped that this meeting will have sufficient success in discussing the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, so that it will not be necessary to hold another meeting in mid-August as previously planned. Since Article 15 of the League Covenant is the main basis for discussion, the League of Nations Council may ask Italy and Abyssinia to reach a settlement themselves, so that the League of Nations can avoid continuing to discuss this dispute. (National Telegraph dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain today firmly defended the authority of the League of Nations in order to save the opportunity for war between Italy and Abyssinia. Soviet Russia has expressed its support for Britain's proposal to use the League of Nations as a tool for peace. The developments in the Italo-Abyssinian situation can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Britain reiterated its opposition to the League of Nations ignoring the matter.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Secretary Hoare assured Parliament that the government is prepared to cooperate with the United States to maintain peace.</p>
<p>(3) Soviet Russia and Turkey advocate exerting the authority of the League of Nations, even if it means forcing Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(4) Insurers are no longer accepting war insurance for East Africa.</p>
<p>(5) Britain denied the rumor that it would continue to send troops to Africa. According to Geneva sources, the League of Nations Secretary-General will submit a report to the Council meeting next week, stating that Japan is currently transporting large quantities of military supplies to Abyssinia via Djibouti in French Somaliland. Observers generally believe that Japan's move will put France in a dilemma. (National Telegraph dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Labor Circles Oppose Italy: Hold General Meeting and Pass Resolution</h3>
<p>(London) The National Labor Federation, jointly organized by the Labor Party Executive Committee, the Labor Party Parliamentary Group, and the British Trades Union Congress, recently held a meeting here to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian issue and passed a resolution. The gist of the resolution stated that "Italian Fascists are trying to deceive the people and make them take risky actions in Africa in the hope of unattainable glory, thereby saving the domestic economic, financial, political, and cultural decline. However, in reality, the various disputes cited by Italy are not significant in nature and have little relevance. They should not cause turmoil and unrest in Africa. Furthermore, the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have become the new international code followed by countries around the world, and the foundation of European peace is also built on these two conventions. Now, because of the Italo-Abyssinian issue, this new international code is in danger of collapsing, and European peace is also in imminent danger. Therefore, the National Labor Federation specifically requests the government to immediately propose, when the League of Nations Council meets, that the Council determine the responsibilities of both Italy and Abyssinia in accordance with the Covenant, and clearly declare that Britain will bear all the obligations and responsibilities that a member state of the League of Nations should bear, without partiality or fear. The League of Nations Council should also, in accordance with Abyssinia's request, immediately send neutral observers to the Abyssinian border to investigate the truth of the dispute. Any person who engages in the slaughter of the African people in pursuit of the glory of a new fascist empire should be prohibited from lending any money. It should be known that the path to a peaceful solution does not lie in forcing Abyssinia to submit to fascist Italy, but in making fascist Italy realize that popular anger is insurmountable, and that it will not dare to act against the great displeasure of the world."

<h3>Italian Newspapers Stop Anti-Japanese Reports</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers have been publishing fierce commentaries attacking Japan in recent days. However, as of the 24th, all newspapers in the country uniformly stopped publishing news and commentaries attacking Japan. The reason seems to be that Mussolini realized the disadvantage of attacking Japan and issued a ban. (Japanese United News dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo Army authorities today spoke about the rumors of Japanese military equipment being transported to Abyssinia, saying that there are various irresponsible rumors about this matter, and their purpose is obviously to involve Japan in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. However, the Army authorities neither admitted nor denied whether it was true that Japan was supplying Abyssinia with military equipment, but said that they did not see the need to explain whether Japan was exporting military equipment to Abyssinia or not.

<h3>London Air Defense Drill: Authorities Announce Defense is Strong</h3>

<h3>Instability in Dutch Politics: Cabinet Considers Resignation</h3>
<p>The Hague Efforts to prevent a cabinet crisis are currently underway behind the scenes, as there are fears of unexpected consequences if one occurs. However, the issue of the cabinet's resignation remains highly possible, as merchants are generally dissatisfied with its firm policy of maintaining the gold standard. Even if the Colijn cabinet resigns, as he is the most respected figure in the country, he will eventually have to return to power sooner or later. According to general observation, the formation of an alliance between the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party is unlikely, as under the current circumstances, the Catholic Party has no other intention than to cooperate with the Colijn Party. Therefore, even if Colijn resigns, the person who forms the new government will undoubtedly be Colijn. According to reliable sources, the Queen seems to be consulting with Colijn again before making a decision on policy. However, some believe that dissolving Parliament and holding new elections is another option after the cabinet resigns. The Dutch Bank and the Dutch government are currently taking all necessary measures to try to maintain the Dutch currency. About seven million gold pounds of gold reserves were proposed to be withdrawn by Britain and France last week. (National Telegraph dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>The Hague According to an official announcement, the Colijn government has not yet resigned, but is considering whether to resign or dissolve Parliament. At the same time, the cabinet will continue to be responsible and will adhere to its policy implemented so far, which is to strive to protect the Dutch currency. If necessary, it will immediately take emergency measures to avoid attacks from all sides. Premier Colijn met with the Queen this afternoon and afterward declared to the political world that the Queen refused to accept the cabinet's resignation. However, how this matter is studied will depend on the developments tomorrow. (National Telegraph dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Division Within the American Silver Bloc: Issue of Repealing the Profits Tax</h3>
<p>(Washington) A division was discovered among the American silver bloc members today. Senator Pittman's statement yesterday that the repeal of the 50% silver profit tax would destroy the compromise previously reached between the silver bloc and President Roosevelt was denied today by Senators Thomas and McCarran. They said that the silver bloc was not bound by any agreement. Pittman is involved in the Western silver mine merger and can no longer be the spokesman for the silver bloc. It is expected that when Thomas presents his views to the Senate on repealing the silver profit tax, the issue of destroying the previous agreement will continue to be discussed. At that time, Thomas will describe the entire situation in detail. President Roosevelt told reporters this afternoon that he was preparing to reply to a letter from the silver bloc and some of its members, but he did not say how he would reply.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Communications' Plan to Train Pilots</h3>

The most important part of this plan is the training of aviation personnel. According to this plan, 400 first-class pilots, 1,000 second-class pilots, and 300 engineers will be trained in ten years. Because the Ministry of Communications relies on the Army and Navy for training, it is insufficient to meet the needs. It intends to establish its own training institutions dedicated to this work.

<h3>Chinese Artifacts Arrive in England: Exhibition in November, Queen to Open</h3>
<p>(London) The British cruiser HMS Suffolk, which departed from Shanghai on June 7 carrying precious Chinese art for the International Art Exhibition at Burlington House this winter, arrived in Portsmouth today. Dr. Chen, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, Sir Casry, Keeper of Documents at the Foreign Office, and Mr. Lyme, Secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts, traveled by car to Portsmouth to greet the ship. The three boarded the ship and had lunch with Captain Manners. They then inspected the hundred steel-clad boxes containing the treasures being unloaded onto three freight cars and a motor truck. The unloading was handled by a commercial firm with extensive experience in transporting treasures from France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Persia to Burlington House for exhibition. The freight cars transporting the treasures are expected to arrive in London at 8:00 PM tonight. Armed police will be stationed on the freight cars, and police officers will accompany them in cars for escort. Zheng Tianxi, a member of the Chinese Exhibition Committee, will monitor the boxes being moved from the cars to the Royal Academy of Arts' warehouse. The boxes will be opened after Chinese packaging experts arrive here in September. The amount of insurance for the treasures is still unknown, as there is no need for insurance during the voyage from Shanghai to London on a British warship. However, the British government is currently handling insurance matters. It is hoped that the Queen will personally attend the opening ceremony of the exhibition in November. The Queen is very interested in Chinese art and is an expert. She will likely exhibit some of her own treasures along with the exhibits. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and his wife were received by the Queen on July 20. The Queen received them in the Chinese Room, which is divided into two large rooms filled with ancient Chinese paintings, porcelains, and bronzes. The Queen discussed Chinese art with Ambassador Guo and his wife for a long time and pointed out the items she had purchased herself. The United States and the Netherlands will also send treasures to the exhibition. Several French, German, and private collectors may also participate. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang's Instructions: The Meaning of the National Flag and the Essentials of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>—Chengdu Extends Commemorative Week and Expands Propaganda Meeting for the New Life Movement—</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: At 9 AM on the 15th, Chairman Chiang Zhuang Rong 7 [character unclear] held an expanded Commemorative Week and the Chengdu New Life Movement expanded propaganda meeting at the Shaocheng Park Sports Ground. Attending were Chairman Chiang, Chairman Liu, staff of the Generalissimo's Headquarters, generals of various armies, various party, government, and military organizations, various schools, various mass organizations, and the city's boy scouts and military training students, totaling approximately 20,000 people. After Chairman Chiang led the flag-raising ceremony, he delivered a political speech, the words of which are as follows: "Chairman Liu, Comrades from all circles, Compatriots, today our comrades and compatriots from all circles in Chengdu are gathered in Shaocheng Park to hold the Premier's Commemorative Week, and before the Commemorative Week, we are holding a flag-raising ceremony. Everyone must know the meaning of the national flag and its relationship to our nation and people, which is very important. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to first tell everyone the meaning of our national flag. The national flag is the sacred symbol representing the country, so we, the citizens of the Republic of China, must first recognize our national flag if we want to recognize our country. If we don't even recognize our own national flag clearly, then we won't have a concept of the country, and of course, we can't love the country. Now, foreigners, whether they are three-year-old children, all recognize their national flags and understand the meaning of their national flags. Therefore, everyone can love the country and sacrifice for the country. However, among our 400 million compatriots in China, very few people truly know the meaning of the national flag. Therefore, the national concept of the general public is extremely weak. Many people hardly know what the national flag is, let alone how to love the country. Therefore, the country is being oppressed and invaded by others day by day, leading to the current critical state of survival. Therefore, in the future, we must make all the people of the country recognize the country and work hard to save the country, and we must first make every compatriot able to recognize and love the national flag that represents the country. The national flag is not only the sacred symbol representing the country, but also the place where the spirit and life of our Han nation, from our ancestor the Yellow Emperor to us and future generations for thousands of years, are concentrated and entrusted. Therefore, the honor and disgrace of the national flag can reflect the rise and fall, honor and disgrace of our entire country and nation. The current style of our Republic of China's national flag, called the 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth,' was created by our Premier, who led the revolutionary party—the Kuomintang—when it first rose up to overthrow the Manchu Qing. Because the Manchu Qing was the enemy of our country and nation, invading our China 300 years ago, occupying our Chinese land, and oppressing our 400 million Chinese compatriots, so that 'the majestic Chinese nation was not worthy of the ranks of nations, and the flourishing clothing and hats were despised by foreign tribes.' The foreign flag—the former dragon flag—flew in our China for more than 200 years. The alien government oppressed our people's national thought, extinguished our people's national spirit, and did not allow our people to personally love the country and value the nation. Because such oppression lasted too long, many of our people still do not know that they have their own country and nation, only knowing their own family, not knowing the country, which is our big family. Only with a country can there be a home, and only with a home can there be a self. Therefore, to protect one's own family, one must first protect the country. If the country is destroyed, one's own family cannot be protected, and one's own self will become a slave or livestock of others. They will beat you when they want to beat you, and kill you when they want to kill you, as the saying goes, 'People are the knife and chopping board, and I am the fish and meat.' At that time, we will have no sovereignty at all, what kind of person would we be? Our Premier, in order to wash away more than 200 years of [character unclear] shameful humiliation, relieve the pain of alien oppression, awaken the national concept and national spirit of all compatriots, and revitalize our 5,000-year-old civilized country, rose up in revolution, overthrew the Manchu Qing, and replaced the dragon flag with the 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' national flag. When the 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' national flag began to rise, it was the time when our nation and people had the supreme independent personality, and began to be independent and free. In other words, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' national flag is the concrete symbol of the independent and free Republic of China. Therefore, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' national flag is the soul that our Chinese nation, from the Yellow Emperor to our ancestors and Premier, and the general revolutionary martyrs, has entrusted to, and it is also the gathering place of the common faith of our 400 million compatriots. Therefore, if we want to respect our ancestors and love our country, we must respect the national flag and love the national flag. Respecting the national flag and loving the national flag is respecting our ancestors and loving our country. When we see the national flag, it is like seeing our country and ancestors, as well as the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution since the Premier, and we should stand in awe and rise up in excitement. We must continue to maintain and carry forward the great national life and culture of our ancestors for 5,000 years, save our country, revitalize our nation, and make the national flag forever fly in the world. This is the meaning that our 400 million people, especially the general young compatriots, should clearly recognize and the responsibility they should bear. This is speaking about the vertical meaning of the national flag. Secondly, I will talk about the horizontal meaning of the national flag. Everyone must know why our Republic of China's national flag is designed as 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth.' This is because our Premier, based on the meaning of 'the world is for the public' and 'all people are equal,' determined it. He used the blue sky and white sun to represent our country, not only wanting our country to be as new as the blue sky and white sun, and to exist permanently in the universe, but also to shine like the sun in the sky, universally illuminating the whole world, making the whole world bright everywhere, and forever bright, creating a new world of freedom, equality, civilization, and peace where the world is for the public. This is a long-term and bright goal indicated by the Premier for our country, and it is also the long-term responsibility of our 400 million people, especially the general young compatriots. Therefore, we should strive to be strong and strive to be heroes to save our country and revitalize our nation, so that our country will become the master of world peace, and promote our national history and culture to benefit the whole world. Speaking of this, there is still one point to add, that is, the twelve rays of the white sun symbolize the eleven [typo, should be twelve] hours of each day and the eleven months of each year. The meaning is that we, like the earth, can continuously progress day and night, year after year, constantly striving for progress, which is the meaning of 'constantly striving for self-improvement like the heavens.' Everyone must know that there is absolutely no person or country in the world that can avoid defeat and destruction if they are lazy, corrupt, and decadent. Only by constantly striving for self-improvement can we, as individuals, succeed in our careers, create a new life for ourselves, and fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and people. As for the nation and people, we can independently survive, create a new life for the nation and people, and achieve the great mission that our Republic of China should bear to the world. The above is an explanation of the vertical and horizontal meaning of the 'form' of the national flag. Below, I will briefly talk about the meaning of the 'color' of the national flag. Generally speaking, the color of the blue sky symbolizes freedom, the color of the white sun symbolizes equality, and the color of the red earth symbolizes universal love. It is very painful for a person to be oppressed in a dark and hopeless situation. Seeing the blue sky and white sun is like coming out of the darkness, and the so-called 'seeing the light of day again' is a very happy thing. This is true for an individual, and the same is true for a nation. Now our nation is being invaded and oppressed, and the danger and pain can be said to have reached the extreme. The national flag instructs our 400 million compatriots to be determined to strive to save the country and achieve a position of freedom and equality, and to create a new China with complete sovereignty and a truly independent personality. And we must use the great benevolence of saving people and teaching the world to save the suffering masses and small and weak nations in the world, so that they can share the happiness of freedom, equality, and peace with us. But how can we achieve this goal of saving the country and saving the world? This all depends on the soundness of our 400 million compatriots. In this regard, the three colors of the national flag have extremely important instructions. The color of the blue sky indicates that our Chinese people should have lofty and great aspirations, the color of the white sun shows that our Chinese people should have a bright and pure heart and mind, and the color of the red earth indicates that our Chinese people should have a warm spirit of sacrifice. If a person has lofty and great aspirations, a bright and pure heart, and a brave and striving spirit of sacrifice for the nation, he will surely become a sage or hero, do a revolutionary cause for society and the country, and be praised and admired by the world and future generations. Conversely, if he has a little selfishness, meanness, baseness, cowardice, and decadence, then he cannot become a sage or hero, and is not worthy of being a citizen of the Republic of China. The red color of the national flag symbolizes the blood of the martyrs who have lofty and great aspirations and pure hearts, and who fought and sacrificed for the freedom and equality of the nation and the salvation of the suffering people. Therefore, the red color of the national flag can be said to be dyed with the immeasurable red blood shed by the martyrs. In the future, if we want to save the country and revitalize it, and strive for the freedom and equality of the nation, and create a solemn and brilliant new country, we must continue the spirit of our martyrs, follow the path of blood of our martyrs, and spill our full cavity of red [character unclear] blood for the nation. [Character unclear] For three hundred years, our ancestors and martyrs, our ancestors, sacrificed many lives and shed much blood to dye the solemn and brilliant national flag as it is now. The souls of our Premier and the ancestors and martyrs who sacrificed for the nation are entrusted to this national flag and flutter above our heads, increasing the status and glory of our nation. Therefore, all of us, up and down the country, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, should especially love the national flag with sincerity, and maintain the national flag with hot blood. The insult of the national flag is our insult, and the glory of the national flag is our glory. We would rather sacrifice everything personal, and absolutely not allow the national flag to be insulted in the slightest. We must know that what the national flag represents is the Republic of China, and the Republic of China is the country of our 400 million people. Our 400 million compatriots must be as close as hands and feet, love each other, be of one heart and one mind, and work together to protect our country and promote our nation. Therefore, the first requirement for saving the country and revitalizing it is that all compatriots in the country help each other, cooperate with each other, be sincerely united, gather the hearts of all the people of the country into one heart, and combine the strength of the country into one force, to strive for survival for the nation and to strive for glory for the country. In this way, we will not be ashamed to be the filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the Yellow Emperor, the true believers of the Premier, and the upright citizens of the Republic of China. Finally, regarding the essentials of the New Life Movement, I have been talking about it a lot in the past two years. You can understand it by reading the books on the New Life Movement. Today, I don't need to say more. In short, the New Life Movement is an easy, basic, and most important method of saving the country. As mentioned earlier, everyone should understand the meaning of the national flag and respect and love the national flag, and protect their compatriots and cooperate with each other to unite as one. This is the most important starting point for practicing the New Life Movement. If you don't know how to respect and love the country, and you can't love and cooperate with your compatriots, then you are not worthy of being a modern citizen of the Republic of China. As for the fundamental spirit of the New Life Movement, it lies in restoring the inherent virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame that have been passed down by our people for five thousand years. The ancients said, "Etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are not established, the country will perish." The reason why our nation is so dangerous today is because we have lost etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Now, if we want to save the country and revitalize the nation, we must first restore the four dimensions. If the four dimensions can be restored, the country will surely be saved and the nation will surely be revitalized. Therefore, I often say, "Etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are established, the country will be revived." If we want to practice etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, we must start from daily life. All aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation must conform to etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. "Etiquette" is a proper attitude and orderly and solemn action. Today, our holding of the Commemorative Week and the flag-raising ceremony is a manifestation of etiquette. With etiquette, we can understand righteousness, observe integrity, and know shame. Therefore, everyone should pay special attention to etiquette, not only to parents and elders should be [character unclear] polite, but also to all comrades and all compatriots should be polite to each other and love each other. In addition, all things must be done properly, clearly distinguished, and truly understood, in order to be considered as practicing the New Life. If all 400 million compatriots in the country [character unclear] can do this, they can become modern citizens and create a civilized and ethical country. Especially the general youth, must do this [character unclear] point, so that they can make contributions to the country and not be ashamed to be the masters of the country in the future. Not only should you practice the New Life yourself, but also hope that you will lead by example and influence everyone you come into contact with, so that everyone can practice the New Life. All 400 million compatriots in the country [character unclear] can unify their will [character unclear], unite their spirit, concentrate their strength, prepare hot blood, and work together to win a breath for the nation. In this way, our country will surely be saved and the nation will surely be revitalized. This is everyone's duty. It is hoped that in accordance with the principles of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and certainty of the New Life, we will work together and earnestly do it to become a citizen of your new era."

<h3>Qin Fen Reports on the River Defense Situation</h3>
<p>Dredging Water and Dyke Breaches All Instructed for Defense; Project Funds Also Being Released Gradually</p>
<p>Beijing News: Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission, attended the Executive Yuan's routine meeting yesterday morning and reported in detail on the recent flood control situation of the Yangtze and Fei Rivers. The content of his flood control report is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Flood Control: Water Level Rising</p>
<p>It has been found that since the beginning of July this year, there has been continuous heavy rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in a sharp rise in water levels in various places upstream. The water level height has even broken past records for the same period, and in some cases, exceeded the highest flood level in the past twenty years. The water levels in the downstream areas have also increased rapidly. At the same time, the Xiang River water level has also risen, causing the Yangtze River embankments to be under extreme pressure. Since the beginning of July, reports of embankment emergencies have been pouring in from all sides. The commission has issued instructions for protection and rescue based on the reported emergencies and overflows.</p>
<p>Gan (Jiangxi) and E (Hubei) Embankments: Rescue Measures</p>
<p>The dangerous situations of each embankment and the additional protection measures instructed by the commission are briefly described as follows: (1) The Guangcheng Wei Haikou Zhou in Anhui Province breached. The commission sent engineer Dong Wenqi to inspect the site and guide the rescue. (2) The Yu Jiapu section of the Ma Hua Dike in Jiangxi Province breached, with a breach width of 380 meters. Qin Fen and others departed on July 7th to inspect the Yangtze River water situation. On their way through Anhui Province, they consulted with Chairman Liu Zhenhua and agreed on a construction project to be directed and supervised by the Yangtze River Commission, with the Director of the Anhui Construction Department serving as the head of the engineering office. They are currently purchasing materials and actively recruiting workers. (3) The A, Gongchu, and Tongren embankments in Jiangxi Province are sinking. The Yangtze River Commission team leader Yang Jian is currently overseeing the efforts of 800 civilians from Jiujiang County and others to vigorously rescue them. As of the 18th, they are still not out of danger. (4) The Deshengtai section of the Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province was reported to have been scoured by a 50-zhang (approximately 167 meters) long and 8-9 chi (approximately 2.7-3 meters) deep washout.

(12) The Zhang Gong Dike in Hankou, Hubei Province, had water levels outside the dike exceeding the river level, causing collapses and extreme danger. The commission has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to work with the Hankou military and political authorities to desperately protect the dike. (13) The Chiqi Shan transverse dike in Jinkou, Hubei Province, had water levels approaching the top of the dike and was experiencing seepage. The commission has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to send personnel to the site to carry out emergency construction. (14) The Wu Hui Dike in Wuchang, Hubei Province, had high water levels and numerous locations with seepage and collapses. The commission has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to send personnel to the site to work with the Wuchang County government to vigorously protect the dike. (15) The Wanshou Guan main dike in Tuanfeng, Hubei Province, was reported on July 10th to have been washed over by the water, causing the dike to collapse for more than two zhang (approximately 6.7 meters). The commission has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to supervise and instruct the Huanggang County government to earnestly protect the dike and find ways to block the breach.</p>
<p>Xiang River Situation: Strict Instructions for Rescue and Blocking</p>
<p>(1) The Lao Long Dike in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, had eight locations with collapses. The commission has ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to work with the local county government to purchase materials nearby and carry out emergency blocking.

The commission has ordered the Jianghan Bureau to supervise the effort to rescue the overflowing and breaching dikes and prevent further expansion.</p>
<p>Repair and Defense Matters: Allocations of Funds</p>
<p>Regarding the repair and defense of dikes within each province, according to the unified water conservancy administrative undertaking implementation measures, the provincial governments should be responsible for planning and handling them as before. The commission previously issued instructions to the provincial governments to follow these measures. It was also stipulated that for river basins where the central government has directly affiliated water conservancy agencies, the provincial repair and defense agencies should be guided by them when handling repair and defense matters to facilitate overall planning. Subsequently, as the flood season approached, in order to ensure that the Yangtze River flood control work this year was particularly thorough, the commission specially appointed Chuan Ruilin, a member of the commission's water conservancy committee, and Mao Yisheng, director of the water conservancy department, to supervise the Yangtze River flood control matters. When it was reported that the dikes along the Jiang and Xiang Rivers were under increasing pressure, the commission, recognizing the severity of the situation, immediately sent multiple telegrams to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, ordering their subordinates to earnestly protect the dikes. In the event of dangerous sections, they must do their best to rescue them. The commission also repeatedly sent telegrams to the provincial governments along the river, urging them to instruct their subordinates to strictly protect the dikes and not be negligent. At the same time, Qin Fen was sent with engineering personnel to inspect the flood control situation along the upper reaches of the river. Instructions were given to the flood control agencies in the areas they passed through in an effort to save the situation. Regarding the repair funds for the provinces along the river, according to the unified water conservancy administrative undertaking measures, the provinces should originally be responsible for them. However, the commission, recognizing that the Yangtze River flood control this year was unusually urgent and fearing that the provinces might be limited by their financial resources, specially allocated assistance to meet emergency needs. As of now, 100,000 yuan has been allocated for flood control, to be managed and distributed by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. It has been reported that the commission has transferred the funds separately based on the situation. As for the flood control funds for the main dikes of the Jiang and Xiang Rivers in Hubei Province, they are paid from the special funds for Hubei dike construction. The original budget for this year was 200,000 yuan. Now, due to the emergency of the dikes and the extremely serious situation, 500,000 yuan has been successively allocated as of now, to be managed and used by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. At the same time, 200,000 yuan has been allocated from the dike funds to assist Hubei Province with the repair and defense of civilian dikes.</p>
<p>Yellow River Water Level: Exceeding Past Years</p>
<p>It has been found that since the beginning of July this year, there have been continuous days of rainfall in the Yellow River area. The entire river basin has been affected, especially the Luo River, Wei River, and areas near Shaanxi and Tongguan. Due to this torrential rain, the amount of water in the Yellow River has suddenly increased this month. The water levels in each river have successively exceeded the records for the same period in past years. The dikes along the river in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces are therefore quite dangerous. In Dongzhuang Linpuji, Chengwu County, Shandong Province, the Tai Dike breached due to the fierce water flow, making rescue impossible. There were a total of five breaches, and the disaster situation was particularly severe. The commission has separately instructed rescue measures for all the areas reporting emergencies.</p>
<p>Most Counties in Western Shandong Affected</p>
<p>(A) The Yellow River's south bank in Shandong, between Dongzhuang and Linpuji, breached on July 10th, with a total of five breaches. The fourth breach was the largest, with a width of 180 meters. The diversion of the flow has reached 80%. The water flow is divided into two streams, flowing southeast and affecting most counties in western Shandong. The Yellow River Commission was immediately instructed by telegram to quickly implement head-wrapping and vigorously protect the Jiangsu Dike to prevent the breaches from expanding. Willow branches were also to be planted at appropriate locations to promote silt deposition and restoration. The commission also telegraphed the commission and the Shandong provincial government to quickly discuss remedial measures. At the same time, an aircraft surveying team was arranged to measure the terrain and water flow around the breaches in preparation for blocking them. (B) Henan Province: (1) The 11-kilometer section of the Guanyu Dike collapsed on July 9th, with a width of approximately 30 meters. Water has overflowed the dike and is flowing backward. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to quickly find ways to block and restore the dike. (2) At the Qinyang Work Site on the East Qin River, the water flow is directly impacting the dike, causing the base of the large dike to collapse, creating an extremely dangerous situation. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to throw stones to protect the dike. (3) At the Qinbei Sentry on the East Qin River, the protective cliff stones have sunk by two meters. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to throw stones and repair the protection. (4) At various locations such as Duicun Xiwanghe on the West Qin River, the barrages have collapsed successively. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to load and throw earth bags and boulders and to repair the barrages at any time. (5) The banks of the Kaocheng New Dike are loose and have been collapsing continuously. The remaining dike is only a little over one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) wide. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to add retaining walls and additional low dikes. (6) At Dongba Tou, the water has reached the level of the dike. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to quickly create low dikes and throw protective boulders. (7) At Wang Xiao Zhuang and Lei Ji Zhuang and other locations, the dike has been overflowed. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to quickly create low dikes. (8) At Wubao 1, 2, and 3 in Rong Ze Xun, the foundations of the dams have shifted due to the rising water and scouring, causing one end of the three dams to shift and sink for a length of 11 meters, creating a dangerous situation. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram, and the Henan provincial government was asked to pay close attention and strictly prevent any further damage. (9) The barrage works of the Lankao Old Dike have been displaced. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to vigorously protect the dike and pay close attention to prevent any further damage. (10) At Wu Zhi, Zheng Shang, Zhong Shang, Kai Chen, Kai Bei, and other locations, the barrage works have shifted. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to vigorously repair the dikes and increase protection. (11) At Jun Li Sai Bu Dao, there has been a lot of water overflowing. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to plant willow trees and protect the dike with earth bags. (C) Hebei Province: (1) A leak has occurred at Shi Tou Zhuang in the northern section, and the water flow is turbulent. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to vigorously block the leak. (2) In the northern section 2, there are several locations where water is entering. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to add low dikes. (3) In the southern section 1, Xiao Pang Zhuang, there are two locations where leaks have occurred. The Yellow River Commission was instructed by telegram to pay close attention and rescue the area. (4) In Dongming County, the dike banks have leaks and collapses at night. The Hebei provincial government was asked to quickly rescue and block the leaks. (5) At Liu Zhuang Guan Ting, the barrages in front and behind have collapsed successively. The Yellow River Commission and the Hebei provincial government were separately telegraphed to throw large rocks and vigorously protect the dike. (6) At Jiu Gu Road, the river water is passing through the Hua Yang Dike and flowing directly into Jiu Gu Road, creating a very dangerous situation. The Yellow River Commission and the Hebei provincial government were separately telegraphed to strengthen the defense.</p>
<p>Disaster-Stricken Area Reaches Over Ten Counties</p>
<p>Regarding the repair and defense of dikes within each province, according to the unified water conservancy administrative undertaking implementation measures, the provincial governments should be responsible for planning and handling them as before. The commission previously issued instructions to the provincial governments to follow these measures. It was also stipulated that for river basins where the central government has directly affiliated water conservancy agencies, the provincial repair and defense agencies should be guided by them to facilitate overall planning. Subsequently, as the flood season approached, in order to ensure that the Yellow River flood control work this year was particularly thorough, the commission specially appointed Kong Xiangrong, a standing member of the commission's water conservancy committee, and Zheng Zhaoqing, deputy director of the water conservancy department, to supervise the Yellow River flood control matters. When the flood season arrived, the dikes along the river in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces successively reported emergencies. The commission immediately issued instructions based on the emergency situation of the dikes reported by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, separately instructing the implementation of rescue and salvage measures. The commission also repeatedly sent separate telegrams to the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, urging them to instruct their subordinates to strictly protect the dikes and not be negligent in any way. In Chengwu County, Shandong Province, the Tai Dike between Dongzhuang and Linpuji overflowed and breached, with five breaches, and the disaster situation was particularly severe. The disaster-stricken area has reached over ten counties.</p>
<p>If the Main Flow Rushes South, Jiangsu Is Also Endangered</p>
<p>If the main flow rushes south, the Jiangsu Dike is in imminent danger. If the flow diverts into the canal and changes course to enter the sea through Xuzhou and Huai'an, then the counties in northern Jiangsu will become a watery land. Therefore, the commission has paid special attention to this and has repeatedly telegraphed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, instructing them to quickly assess the water situation with the Shandong provincial government and carefully propose remedial measures, blocking the breaches as appropriate. The commission has also ordered the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau to quickly implement head-wrapping to prevent the situation from worsening. At the same time, the commission has sent a telegram to the Shandong provincial government, urging them to do their best to rescue the area, and has sent a telegram to the Jiangsu provincial government, instructing them to order their subordinates to be on high alert to prevent the disaster from expanding. The commission has also sent Zheng Zhaoqing, the deputy director of the water conservancy department, along with engineering personnel, to the breached area to conduct on-site inspections and to discuss salvage measures with the Shandong provincial government in Jinan. According to a telegram from Deputy Director Zheng in Jinan, the water flow at the breach in the Tai Dike between Dongzhuang and Linpuji is turbulent, making surveying difficult. An aircraft will be dispatched to handle the surveying immediately.</p>
<p>Agreed on Measures: Blocking the Breaches as Appropriate</p>
<p>Yesterday, a joint telegram was received from Chairman Han Fuqu, Committee Chairman Li Yizhi, and Deputy Director Zheng Zhaoqing, stating that four measures have been agreed upon for blocking the breach in Dongzhuang: (1) The Shandong provincial government will urge the River Affairs Bureau to be responsible for blocking the breach, and the Yellow River Commission will provide assistance. (2) The national government is requested to specially allocate funds for the breach blocking work, which will be temporarily advanced jointly by the Economic Commission, Shandong Province, and relevant provinces, with the Economic Commission contributing 30%, Shandong Province contributing 20%, and the relevant provinces contributing 10%. (3) The current remedial measure is to plant willow trees to promote silt deposition, protect the Jiangsu Dike, and quickly propose a dike construction plan while preparing materials. (4) After the materials are ready, the breaches will be blocked as appropriate. This breach blocking project is extremely urgent, and the original proposals are indeed important. The requested advance funds will be fully prepared to the extent that financial resources allow. As for the Yellow River flood control funds, the commission has successively allocated 150,000 yuan to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission for unified use as of now. The repair and defense costs for the provinces along the river should originally be borne by the provinces as before, according to the unified water conservancy administrative undertaking implementation measures. However, the disaster situation in Shandong Province is particularly severe, and funds are urgently needed. The commission has advanced 60,000 yuan to the Shandong provincial government to meet emergency needs.</p>

<p>Eighth First Children's Day Visit to Government Offices</p>
<p>August 1st is Children's Day. The Children's Year Implementation Committee of this county petitioned the county government to issue an order to all government offices to raise flags and celebrate on this day, and to collect prizes for encouragement. In order to arouse children's interest, representatives of children from each school were selected to visit the government offices in the city, and they were given preferential treatment. It is reported that on that day, various party, government, military, and police agencies prepared prizes and sent them to the committee for distribution.</p>
<p>Establishment of Women's Education and Training Center</p>
<p>The county's relief center has gradually implemented relief programs, such as the establishment of material distribution centers and poverty relief centers. It is now learned that the Women's Education and Training Center has also been prepared and has renovated the old site of the handicraft training center as an office. Zhong Taishi has been appointed as the director. It is reported that due to limited funds, the center will temporarily accommodate 30 women, teaching them embroidery, sewing, housework, etc. After the training period is over, they will be matched with suitable partners.</p>

<p>Private Prostitutes in Jinmen Stop Paying Dues in Protest</p>
<p>The Wuxian Public Security Bureau has recently been very strict in dealing with the issue of prostitution. As a result, there have been several cases of private prostitutes being fined every day. Therefore, the general private prostitutes are very resentful. Among the private prostitutes, there is a Changzhou woman nicknamed Lao Wu, who has considerable influence. She suddenly notified all the private prostitutes outside Jinmen on the evening of the 24th to unanimously stop paying dues. At that time, those who had already taken customers returned the night fees as a protest. Because the business of the various hotels outside the gate depends entirely on private prostitutes, it is expected that the hotels will come forward to mediate after the protest. However, most of the private prostitutes are poor, and it is feared that the suspension of dues will not last long. Therefore, the Jinmen Road, which is known as a city that never sleeps, suddenly felt deserted, which is also an interesting anecdote in the crackdown on prostitution.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Xihu Road Opens to Traffic at the Beginning of the Month</p>
<p>The Xihu Highway, which was constructed by the Jiangsu Construction Department since April of last year, has been completed in all aspects. It was originally scheduled to be officially handed over to Mei Chengzhang, the director of the Xihu Road Engineering Office, on July 15th. However, Mr. Mei was in Beijing at the time, presiding over the flood control work in Beijing, and could not spare himself. Therefore, it was not implemented. Mr. Mei returned to Wuxi the day before yesterday after finishing his official duties in Beijing and handed over all the procedures of the Engineering Office to the company to take over. As for the date of the opening ceremony, it is scheduled for August 1st at the Luyang Bridge in Nanxiang. At that time, there will definitely be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Eighth Branch Bureau Captures Four Thieves</p>
<p>The home of farmer Zhang Jinfu in Zhangqiaotou, Third District, was robbed by more than ten bandits at around 12:00 AM on April 26th of this year, suffering a loss of more than 100 yuan. The day before yesterday, Gao Shichun, the director of the Eighth Branch Bureau of Public Security in charge of the area, captured Zhang Agen, Yu Rongquan, and accomplices Xu Ashou and Xu Qisheng and other four robbers in Xiajiabian Qingqi Village and other places. They were all brought to the bureau for strict interrogation. The robbers confessed to robbing Zhang Jinfu's home, and they were immediately presented to the general bureau. Yesterday (the 25th), they were transferred to the county government for interrogation. Wu Gengshi, the director of the trial division, opened a court to interrogate them once and ordered them to be detained together pending investigation.</p>
<p>Jiang Zhen</p>
<p>Regulations for Ranks of Strong Labor Team Leaders</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs has repeatedly received reports from various counties that the compilation of strong labor teams has been completed, and that the ranks of the leaders of each level of the strong labor teams have not yet been promulgated. In order to unify the ranks, the department has stipulated that the rank of the battalion commander is lieutenant colonel, the battalion adjutant is major, the company commander is captain, the company adjutant is lieutenant, and the platoon leader is second lieutenant. Orders have been sent to each county to follow these regulations.</p>
<p>High Court Branch Office Organizes Detention Center</p>
<p>The Fifth Branch of the High Court was formally established on the first of this month. The number of civil and criminal appeals from various counties has been increasing day by day. In order to organize the detention center, the court sent the prisoners previously held in the High Court back to Suzhou. At the same time, 30 appeal cases from various counties under the jurisdiction of the High Court were transferred to the detention center to await trial.</p>
<p>Haimen</p>
<p>Famous Drug Dealer Dies in Prison</p>
<p>Wei Kanghai, a famous drug dealer in this county, secretly set up a mechanism near the Elderly Hall in the west of the county city in October of the previous year to manufacture red pills. Hao, the former director of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to crack the case, and Wei and the pill-making machines and raw materials were all sent to the county and then to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command. After the facts were ascertained, he was sentenced to five years in prison and sent back to the county prison for execution in May of last year. Wei suddenly contracted erysipelas in prison. After repeated treatments, the treatments failed to work. On the 23rd, Chen, the auditor, went to the Doutian Hall for inspection and confirmed that he had died of illness. It was ordered that the Pushan Hall prepare a coffin to collect the body and wait for the family to claim it.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Planning to Reduce Land Tax</p>
<p>The land tax in Tongyi is more than thirteen yuan per mu, including regular tax and surcharges, which is difficult for the people to bear. It was decided at the county administrative meeting to set up a research association to reduce land tax surcharges. Wu Jiqian and other nine people were selected as members. The first meeting is scheduled for August 1st.</p>
<p>The Arrival of the Dada New Ship</p>
<p>The Dada Shipping Company's new ship, the Dada, arrived at Tianshenggang at noon on the 23rd on its maiden voyage between Shanghai and Yangzhou. Yang Guanbei, Wang Xianglun, and other employees of the company invited local people from all walks of life to board the ship for a visit. Commissioner Zheng also attended, as well as the county magistrates of Tong, Rugao, Hai'an, Chongming, Qidong, and Jingjiang. The ship departed for Yangzhou at 5:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Criminals Tried by Military Law</p>
<p>A large-scale drug trafficking organization was uncovered in Tongcheng, and more than one hundred male and female criminals were arrested. They have been sent to the district security headquarters for trial by military law. The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Commission telegraphed Commissioner Zheng, stating that in the recent searches for drug offenders in Nantong, more than 100 people have been arrested, many of whom are major criminals. The commission praised Commissioner Zheng's effective supervision and County Magistrate Jin and Public Security Bureau Director Song for their loyalty and diligence in performing their duties and for their ability to carry out a large-scale crackdown on drugs. The commission requested that they be praised for their efforts.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>The River Tide Flows Backwards, and the Riverbank is Again in Danger</p>
<p>The water level in each section of the canal rose slightly on the 24th by one or two inches. The water level at the Yuma Tou in Gaoyou reached 4.954 meters, and the water level at the Wanjia Tang Lake was 4.860 meters. Because the southeast wind has been very strong for several days, the river tide has flowed back to Gaoyou. Therefore, the water level in the canal area of Guazhou and Yangzhou has been particularly high in recent days. Small boats have reached the towing period. It is reported that the Canal Engineering Bureau has received an order from the province that all long-distance telephones used to transmit flood prevention information in Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Shiying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Lianshui, Guanyun, and Fengxian counties are allowed to connect free of charge. As for the Liuxu riverbank problem, the embankment along the coast is in imminent danger due to the strong scouring force of the southeast wind for several days. The Construction Bureau has sent personnel to be stationed at the Yangtze Bridge to test the water records every day and report them at any time so that preparations can be made.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association Submits to the Central Political Council, etc., Listing Various Difficulties with the Publication Law, Requesting Submission to the Legislative Yuan for Reconsideration</h3>
<p>Since the Publication Law was promulgated in the 19th year of the Republic of China, it has been in effect for several years. Recently, the Legislative Yuan passed an amended Publication Law, which is seen as more restrictive than before. Industry colleagues in various regions have conducted in-depth research and believe that there are too many difficulties. Without reconsideration and postponement of its implementation, they have sent telegrams to the Central Political Council and the National Government, requesting reconsideration. Various Beijing-based reporters also jointly petitioned the Central Political Council, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association has prepared a detailed list of difficulties and submitted it to the Central Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior. The original submission is excerpted below: "Submitting this document regarding the significant impact of the Publication Law. The full text recently passed by the Legislative Yuan is even more restrictive and difficult to implement. It should be submitted for reconsideration based on different principles. It is our humble opinion that culture is the foundation of a nation, and fostering public intelligence depends on public opinion. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has adopted a policy of encouraging the news industry, tracing back to the political program established by the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, which stipulated in Article 6 of the domestic policy that the people have complete freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, and residence. The Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage also explicitly states freedom of speech and publication. Furthermore, the National Assembly has passed a resolution to effectively assist the news industry. Items such as postal fees and newspapers have also been subject to tax and fee reductions by the responsible ministries and departments to demonstrate promotion. It is evident that the government's support for the news industry has been comprehensive. Although the Publication Law promulgated in the 19th year cannot be considered perfect, it has provided a basis for compliance. Those engaged in the news industry have diligently followed it for years, fulfilling the state's intention to cherish and promote public opinion. However, the Legislative Yuan, acting on the instructions of your council, has re-deliberated the Publication Law and made numerous amendments, which were passed on the 12th of this month. After careful reading and consideration, our association believes that the stipulated articles differ significantly from the current law and impose even more restrictions, making implementation difficult. We hereby list the specific points below: 1. The Publication Law aims to regulate the entire publishing industry nationwide. However, an examination of all 49 articles reveals that they are almost exclusively aimed at suppressing the news industry. The issuance of newspapers requires prior registration, changes require temporary registration, and there are strict restrictions on publishers and editors, even to the point that imprisonment for more than one month would disqualify them from working in the newspaper industry again. Furthermore, various penalties are established, with punishments being severe. While this is inherent in the current law, it does not align with the goals of promoting culture, developing public intelligence, and supporting the news industry. Now that the country is gradually becoming sound and the governance is increasingly consolidated, the situation is no longer comparable to that of the 19th year. However, the new law further increases the scrutiny of organizational structure, funding sources, and distribution plans, which is even more harsh than before. Its implementation may not be helpful, as unscrupulous individuals may use deceptive language to evade suppression, while those who are cautious and conscientious may find themselves trapped. Therefore, we earnestly request your council to re-establish principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, relaxing the regulations so that both urban and remote areas can establish local newspapers to assist in improving politics and guiding education. This is the first point, regarding the restrictions on the establishment of new newspapers under the Publication Law, for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration." 2. The local competent authorities for publications were previously designated as the provincial government or the municipal government under the Executive Yuan in the old law. The new law changes this to the county government and the social affairs bureau of the municipal government under the Executive Yuan, granting them more power to seize and correct publications. Newspapers are circulated nationwide, and public opinion arises from clear deliberation. Even if there are occasional lapses in judgment, senior officials should be responsible for rectifying them. However, the new law allows local county governments, etc., to take emergency measures at any time, regardless of their personnel and organization or their ability to handle the situation appropriately. If there are cases of suspicion, bias, or abuse of power, improper measures may be unavoidable. Recent incidents in various counties demonstrate the significant impact of changing the competent authorities. This is the second point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. 3. Social news is related to public morals and should be given attention, which is of course appropriate. However, both the old and new laws already have provisions against harming good customs, and the criminal law also has specific articles on crimes such as defamation. The new law further establishes explicit provisions against publishing personal or family privacy. The distinction between public and private affairs in the news industry is often subtle, and they are often intertwined. In these degenerate times, when public morals are declining, licentiousness and transgressions directly affect the individual's privacy and indirectly affect the entire society. Praising the good and condemning the bad may slightly improve the social atmosphere. As for harming good customs and recording obscene language, there are already laws to suppress them. However, the provision on personal privacy should not be used to encompass everything, as it lacks scope and standards. If the new law is promulgated, any person being reported on, as well as the competent authorities related to the person being reported on, may use Article 38 to punish the newspaper at any time, making the news industry a target of public criticism. This may not be the intention of the legislature. Furthermore, in remote areas, competent authorities often use personal relationships to apply the articles, abuse their powers, and suppress newspapers. In such cases, they will stop at nothing. Information obtained by public security organs may become a problem in society but may not involve litigation in the judiciary. Such cases are common. In the future, once published, there will be even more disputes, which will undoubtedly harm the development of the news industry. This is the third point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. 4. Advertisements and announcements are the responsibility of the person who publishes them. Newspapers usually carefully select the manuscripts they receive and would never deliberately violate the regulations to invite trouble. However, private advertisements and announcements made by lawyers on behalf of their clients often involve personal or family privacy. How can newspapers alone be held responsible for such private legal actions? The news industry has a significant impact on the safety and security of the entire nation and the rise and fall of the nation, so the penalties are also the most severe in Article 19, Section 4. Even in the most extreme cases, the imprisonment is only two years, and the fine is only less than one thousand yuan. However, newspapers that indirectly publish private legal actions may be punished according to Article 38, with six months of imprisonment and a fine of five hundred yuan. The disparity in severity is not fair. This is the fourth point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. 5. Article 22 of the new law adds the words "politics and local security" to the items to be considered during wartime or in times of turmoil, compared to the current law. During wartime and times of turmoil, unity of purpose and concerted efforts are the disciplines that citizens should abide by, without the need for unnecessary words. However, the political aspect is already comprehensively covered by the provisions of Article 19, Section 4. Local security often occurs suddenly, and the scope varies greatly. If it is necessary to rely on the orders of the National Government, it will be too late to take emergency measures. The local competent authorities, such as the county government, may also exaggerate or conceal the facts by citing the articles. If there are no restrictions at all, it is not a safe plan, but a broad statement is difficult to follow. This is the fifth point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. 6. When a newspaper publishes something and someone requests a correction, it is customary to publish the correction. This is not only a business practice but also a moral obligation. The current law specifies a special article stating that the correction should be given a position equivalent to the original article. The new law changes this to the same position. A single word makes a big difference. Placing it in the same position is often factually difficult. For example, if the first section is disclosed today, and a correction is made tomorrow, the timeliness will be lost, and it will never be placed in the first column again. Although this is a trivial matter, there is absolutely no problem according to custom. It is unnecessary to list it in the article. Furthermore, disputes between the two parties are numerous, and each party makes corrections. Lengthy articles are published, and each party insists on its own opinion. Newspapers find it difficult to investigate and verify within three days, especially from distant places. If they are published as they are, there will be no distinction between right and wrong. Newspapers will face difficulties that cannot be expressed. This is the sixth point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. 7. The responsibilities of publishers, authors, etc., are not clearly defined in this law. Articles 37, 38, and 39 list publishers, editors, authors, and printers together, without explaining whether they are jointly punished. Article 40 states that those who are responsible for the publication and signing of the articles are to be punished according to Article 37, and the same applies to those who are punished according to Article 39. The meaning of the legislation is not clear, and the articles are difficult to find. Editors may take short vacations, and temporary replacements may be negligent. If the person at fault has no responsibility, while the person on vacation is punished, it is unfair. The news published in daily newspapers comes from various sources and is not usually signed. However, it is now said that those who sign the article are responsible for the punishment, leaving newspapers at a loss. This is the seventh point for which we respectfully request your council to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. Furthermore, this law only contains articles on government suppression, with no opportunities for newspapers to appeal. If the law is promulgated and implemented, and the relevant authorities take inappropriate measures or make mistakes in seizure and punishment, newspapers will be banned, and public opinion will be suppressed. What legal remedies can be taken in administrative procedures? Newspapers value circulation, and rapid distribution is especially important. Even if an appeal is successful afterward, the time for postal delivery has passed, and the timeliness of the newspaper is completely lost. How will this loss be compensated? The spirit of national legislation and the government's intention to support the news industry should not be like this. In summary, we respectfully submit this document to your council, requesting that you thoroughly investigate it from both a legal and factual perspective, so as to avoid difficulties in implementation after promulgation. Your council is the highest political body in the country and will surely understand the root causes and consider the established rules. We respectfully request that you re-establish principles and submit them for reconsideration, so that the law can be fully implemented and freedom of speech can be effectively protected. We urgently present our words and are deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Political Conference of the Central Executive Committee." (Rest omitted)</p>

<h3>Minister Kong and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Ye Chucang left Beijing on the overnight express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Xu Fu Talks About Visiting Kong to Discuss Finance, Construction Bonds, and Mortgaging Existing Funds; Preliminary Contact Has Been Made with the Banking Community</h3>
<p>Xu Fu, the Director of Finance of the Fujian Provincial Government, recently came to Shanghai from Fujian to visit Minister Kong to discuss the financial problems of Fujian Province and the mortgaging of existing funds for local construction bonds. Xu met with reporters from the Central News Agency at the City Bank yesterday morning. According to him, after the suppression of bandits in Fujian Province, construction needs to be undertaken, requiring a large amount of funds. This trip to Shanghai is to report on provincial affairs to Chairman Chen, who is staying in Shanghai, and to meet with Minister Kong, who is coming to Shanghai, to discuss financial issues. Regarding the local construction bond of 3 million yuan, after the approval of the Executive and Legislative Yuans, a portion of the bond, approximately 1 million yuan, has been mortgaged to the banking community in Fujian Province and handed over to the Construction Department for use. The remaining 2 million yuan of face value will be negotiated with the banking community in Shanghai for mortgage. He met with bankers on the 24th for initial contact, but a decision can only be made after discussing it with Minister Kong. The mortgage banking group will be chaired by the Central Bank. Xu continued, stating that the affairs of the province are currently busy and need to be dealt with urgently. Therefore, if Minister Kong can come to Shanghai this morning to meet and discuss, he will take a boat back to Fujian that night.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Dutch Ambassador to China Will Arrive in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow; Ministry Orders Yu Ming to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Dutch Ambassador to China, Mr. F.C. Steuber, previously departed from the Netherlands and passed through the East Indies. He is taking the Java Company's Chichadani to China to take up his new post. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, according to the French-Chinese Company, the ship encountered a storm en route and must be postponed until the 28th to arrive in Shanghai. It is reported that Yu Ming, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has received an order from the Ministry to go to the port to welcome him at that time.</p>
<h3>A Section of Track Near the South Station Will Be Temporarily Disconnected This Morning; French Water Company Agreed with the Railway Bureau to Bury Water Pipes Across the Track</h3>
<p>The section of track at the Shanghai South Station West Gate of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was dismantled at 4:30 this morning, cutting off traffic, until 7:00, when traffic was restored. The French-owned Lujiawan Water Company plans to bury a water pipe under the railway track at that location. The company's engineers contacted Engineer Luo of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and reached an agreement to allow the work to begin at 4:30 this morning and be completed by approximately 7:00. Fortunately, no passenger or freight trains passed through that road during this time. Yesterday, the Engineering Department notified all stations accordingly.</p>
<h3>Mingxing and Jiangda, Two Vessels Rescue Stranded Ships</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Mingxing ship ran aground on the right bank of Yangluo, 60 miles downstream of Hankou. After three failed attempts to tow it, all 3,000 officers and soldiers and hundreds of horses on board were transferred. The heavy objects inside the ship were unloaded. Two large towing barges were used to tow it. Fortunately, although the downstream water level was decreasing, it was the peak season for upstream water levels. The ship was successfully towed off the ground on Wednesday afternoon and is now heading to Hankou. According to the shipowner's report, the stranding was due to the Jianghan Customs having moved the Yangluo lightship after the flood to prevent accidents. However, the Mingxing ship was in Nanjing at the time and was unaware of this, resulting in the accidental grounding. The company has telegraphed all ships to inform them to avoid further accidents. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangda ship ran aground on the opposite bank of Yangluo on the night of the 19th. Jiangyu and Meicheng were sent to tow it, but they were unable to pull it off the sandbar. Later, the shipowner, Feng Jun, personally went to Hankou and rented two large towing barges from Taikoo, which towed it off the ground after five hours. Only the car leaves were slightly detached. After being tied up, it was able to sail to Hankou. This happened on Tuesday night. Yesterday's telegram stated that it had safely escaped.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Water Levels Fall, Shipping Gradually Resumes; Four Chartered Vessels Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flooding Halts Cargo</p>
<p>During the major flooding of the Yangtze River, Hankou was in grave danger. The bottom floors of the wharves and warehouses of various shipping companies could not hold cargo. The wharf laborers were requisitioned for flood control, causing almost all cargo transportation to be halted. The business of all ships was affected.</p>
<p>River Water Recedes</p>
<p>In the past few days, the weather in Hankou has been very good, and the river water has receded significantly. Local shipping companies received telegrams from the Hankou branch yesterday, stating that the water level in Hankou had dropped two feet in the past two days (23rd and 24th), and the danger has passed. People's hearts are at ease, and the water has also receded along the coast, allowing for the resumption of loading and unloading operations at all wharves. The Shanghai branch has been requested to immediately resume shipping goods to Hankou. Various shipping companies have followed suit. Starting today, there will be no restrictions on the loading of goods bound for Hankou.</p>
<p>Anhui Also Reopens</p>
<p>Wuhu initially requested the suspension of shipments from Shanghai due to the inability of the wharves to accommodate cargo. Anqing followed suit. The suspension of shipments to Anhui by various ships in Shanghai has lasted for more than ten days. Yesterday, a telegram was suddenly received from Anqing, reporting that the water in Anhui has gradually receded, and the wharves can handle the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo. Please resume normal loading of goods from Shanghai. It is reported that various companies have resumed shipping.</p>
<p>Chartered Cargo</p>
<p>The Yangtze River charter has been implemented since yesterday. The first batch of goods being shipped to the Yangtze River, calculated by charter, included the Jiang of the China Merchants Bureau, the Ningjing of the Ningshao Company, the Wuchang of the Taizan Company, and the Ruihe of Jardine Matheson. The calculation for cargo leaving Hankou will also begin with the ships departing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Qingning Has Arrived in Keelung; Zhuang Huibo Says It Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 29th</h3>
<p>The Hwaning Shipping Company's Qingning ship, with a deadweight of 1,951 tons, usually travels along the northern and southern coasts. The ship transported goods from Shanghai to Shantou, unloaded all the cargo, and then went to Keelung to load coal to return to Shanghai. However, when it reached the South China Sea, it encountered a hurricane. In the past three days, the ship had not telegraphed Shanghai to notify its itinerary, leading to rumors in Shanghai that the whereabouts of the Qingning ship were unknown, and its whereabouts were unknown for a time, arousing the deep attention of the shipping industry in Shanghai. The insurance industry was particularly concerned. This reporter went to the Hwaning Company on Sijing Road to inquire. According to the manager of the company, Zhuang Huibo, the Qingning has arrived in Keelung today (referring to the 25th) and is now loading coal. It has not been lost. After loading coal in Keelung, it will sail to Shanghai and is expected to arrive on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Bank Association Amends Constitution; Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Approves for Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bank Association amended Article 3 of its constitution, regarding the procedures for member banks to join the association. The fourth general meeting of members had previously approved the principles and handed them over to the Executive Committee to formulate the amended articles, which were submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for record. The association has now received an order from the Social Affairs Bureau approving it for record. After receiving the orders from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, they will be forwarded to the members for compliance, so that banks that want to join the association in the future can follow the amended procedures.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yang Yinpu's Opinion: Bank Acceptance Drafts – More Advantages than Disadvantages, a Major Advancement for Our Financial Organization, Greatly Aiding the Development of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Central China Times reports that the banking sector is planning to create bank acceptance drafts to expand credit and aid industry and commerce. All sectors have unanimously expressed their approval, and the implementation is only a matter of time. It is reported that the acceptance drafts were originally scheduled to be implemented on August 1st, but it is feared that it will be too late. It is rumored that the implementation date will be changed to around August 10th, so that the industrial and commercial sectors can issue acceptance drafts during the August festival this year and obtain financial circulation. The Central China Times reporter interviewed economist Mr. Yang Yinpu yesterday. According to him, since the financial crisis in Shanghai, which resulted in a credit crunch, the general use of funds has become constrained. Due to the low social credit, financial institutions find it difficult to issue loans, leading to stagnant capital. Industrial and commercial enterprises, on the other hand, are suffering from the inability to use funds, resulting in a decline in the overall market. Recently, people in the banking sector, recognizing this, have started bank acceptance drafts to expand the use of bills. This matter is very beneficial to improving the current financial situation. Without this bank acceptance draft, the credit aspect has the double guarantee of actual goods and the banking sector's funds. Its reliability is above bank drafts and commercial acceptance drafts. Its impact on social finance is also more advantageous than disadvantageous, and the scope of circulation and use in the market in the future can be infinitely expanded. For example, at the beginning of the establishment, the fund amount is set at 50 million yuan. In the future, if the society is stable and the general production volume increases, the total amount of acceptance drafts can also be increased accordingly. The flexibility is very convenient. At the same time, after the circulation of this type of bill in the future, not only will the industrial and commercial sectors benefit, but also individual investment will have new outlets. The indirect effects will have a great effect on the development of production enterprises. Moreover, if bank acceptance drafts are widely circulated, a clearing system can be created invisibly in the future. Banks can collect payments without mortgages and focus on discount business. Finally, according to Mr. Yang, the previous commercial acceptance drafts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were intended to replace credit loans, and the purpose of the current creation of bank acceptance drafts is also to replace mortgage loans. China's financial organization and structure have made such reasonable progress due to encountering difficulties, which is indeed a good phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Wang Qingmu's Detailed Suggestions to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner: One on Local Taxes, One on Provincial Government Organization</h3>
<p>Mr. Qingmu, a gentleman from Jiangsu Province, submitted a detailed statement to Mr. Ding Chaowu, the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner, regarding local taxes and provincial government organization matters. The original text is excerpted below. Regarding the detailed statement, I believe that from ancient times to the present, the beauty of governance should be attributed to the Han Dynasty. At that time, there were governors who traveled around the prefectures and states. Gu Tinglin called it a good law that would not change for a hundred generations. The Ming Dynasty's censors, who inspected the local areas, can be said to have captured the meaning of the ancients. Now, the National Government's Control Yuan has reports from the supervisory commissioners of various provinces, and our Jiangsu has the arrival of Your Excellency to rectify the officialdom and relieve the people's difficulties. The responsibility is very heavy, and the expectations are very high. Are there any members of the public who are not rejoicing and excited? In the Book of History, one chapter says to widely consult, the second chapter says to widely deliberate, the third chapter says to widely measure, and the fourth chapter says to widely inquire, which shows the diligence in visiting and consulting, and not being afraid of trouble. Recently, as the carriage is about to depart, cases from various regions are coming one after another. Given the vastness of Jiangsu Province and the large population, if every matter, no matter how big or small, is properly handled, I am afraid that there will not be enough time. How should we distinguish between the important and the urgent? Which ones must be handled personally, which ones should be sent to the subordinates to investigate and report, and then submitted for review and approval? Which ones should be transferred to the judiciary for fair judgment? Other trivial and non-urgent matters should be put aside. Then, focus your attention and investigation on officials who are corrupt and shield local bullies. Expose the evidence of their entanglement and expand the fields. For the people who are suffering and feel trapped, and whose livelihood is on the verge of collapse, rescue them as soon as possible. Clean up the discipline of the country, relieve the people from their plight. The news spreads, and the public listens attentively. It is like a great drought receiving timely rain, turning barren areas into fertile land. It all depends on the current actions of Your Excellency. Is the public's expectation not important? Qingmu has personally witnessed the special difficulties, forgetting his old age. He has been studying the gains and losses of politics and believes that there are things that urgently need to be corrected and reformed. I would like to sincerely tell Your Excellency about one thing: the improper distribution of local taxes. Land tax has always been a major source of national revenue, so local expenses are also paid from the land tax. Since the separation of national and local taxes, land tax has been used exclusively for local taxes. According to the interpretation of the word "local," it should be based on the county as the main body, not the province. Now, looking at the budget prepared by our Jiangsu Province, all the land tax revenue is used as provincial tax, and the county does not receive any of it. The additional tax of two and a half cents per tael of silver, which was previously collected, has now been changed to a special fund for provincial education, which is no different from the regular tax. The additional tax of three cents per tael of silver, which was previously collected, and the county additional tax of one yuan per stone in the canal counties, is now called county regular tax. The total amount for the entire province is only two to three million yuan. Therefore, the county's local autonomy projects all rely on additional taxes for support. The mu tax is the larger of the additional taxes. If it is not enough, they take it from harsh and miscellaneous taxes. At this time of commercial depression, the people are haggard, and the countryside is bankrupt. It is difficult to scrape together. The central government, in view of this, has established a local donation and tax supervision committee to sort out, select, and reduce or exempt the harsh ones. The intention is very sincere, but there are too many constraints. It is already extremely difficult to cut one to two million yuan from the entire province, let alone more? Even if one to two million yuan can be cut, it will still not save the people from poverty, let alone if it cannot be cut? Article 3 of the Executive Yuan's Measures for Reorganizing Land Tax Surcharges last year stipulates that the total amount of surcharges shall not exceed the regular tax. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Ministry of Finance's Measures for Restricting Land Tax Surcharges stipulates that counties with land tax surcharges exceeding the regular tax shall find ways to reduce them to at most the same amount as the regular tax. It can be seen that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry deeply know that the people cannot bear the burden, so there are these regulations for reducing taxes. The people were overjoyed when they heard about it, thinking that there was hope for recovery. But who knew that the provincial government could not implement it? The county's autonomous expenses all rely on additional taxes, and the trend is that they will only increase without end. How can taxes be reduced? As the saying goes, if the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient? If the people are insufficient, with what will the ruler be sufficient? It is also said that having a heart that cannot bear to see people suffer is having a government that cannot bear to see people suffer. The worthies in the Jiangsu Provincial Government, coming from the fields, have often seen the people's insufficiency, and must have a heart that cannot bear to see them suffer. For the current plan, the county is the main body of local autonomy. The Legislative Yuan has already resolved that land tax should belong to the county. We should advance the plan to provide land tax to cover county expenses, as well as deed tax and various business taxes. As for land tax surcharges, follow the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, and temporarily allow collection up to the amount of the regular tax. In this way, local autonomy will have a legitimate source of tax revenue, the people's strength will be slightly relieved, and the arrears of taxes will be less. This is the saying that the distribution of local taxes should be changed. The organization of the provincial government is not good. The province is the name of a government office, which first appeared in the Wei and Jin Dynasties. It was the Central Secretariat. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Central Secretariat's Provincial Branch was established, intending to centralize power. The Ming and Qing dynasties followed this, but the name of the province was inherited, and the original meaning was lost. By the Republic of China, there were provinces that did not obey the orders of the central government, which was equivalent to the Tang Dynasty's feudal towns. Since the National Government moved to Nanjing, the provincial government has a committee system, with one person serving as chairman and various departments set up, with committee members concurrently serving as heads. There are also several committee members who do not concurrently serve as heads. All politics are decided by meetings. Although the name is public, there are many constraints. The expenses are huge, and the effectiveness is weak. Recently, several provinces have changed to joint offices, probably because the department system is not suitable for provincial administration. Fifty years ago, Wu Zhihui proposed to shrink the province area, aiming for quick implementation of policies. However, shrinking the province area and still using the current committee system is absolutely impossible. It is better to abolish the name of the province and call it a prefecture. Taking Jiangsu as an example, apart from the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the area south of the Yangtze River is divided into two prefectures, and the area north of the Yangtze River is divided into four prefectures, which are directly under the central government and under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. The head of the prefecture is called the prefect, and the name implies that he is actually guarding the land. The expenses of the prefecture are provided by the counties under its jurisdiction. Each prefecture and county has a council, and members are selected from local impartial gentry. The country establishes officials, divided into two levels, the ministries and commissions and the prefectures and counties. The central government controls from a high position, just like the body uses the arms, and the arms use the fingers. If the bones and joints are difficult to communicate, there will be no danger of the tail wagging the dog. Compared to the current equality of ministries and provinces, where the ministry's orders cannot be implemented in the provinces, the benefits cannot be enumerated. The country takes the people as its foundation, and local autonomy takes the county as the unit. How the people's strength goes from weak to strong, and how the county changes, all depend on the surplus or deficit of expenses as the key to progress or retreat. The Canal tax is renamed land tax, and the full amount belongs to the county. Large counties are certainly affluent, but small counties have less revenue, so they can be merged as appropriate to equalize them. Now, Jiangning is indeed a rich county with hope for development. Zhenjiang and Donghai counties are considered poor by the provincial government and are trying to help them. I don't know that the national crisis is becoming more urgent, and the people's livelihood is becoming more difficult. The responsibility of saving the country and seeking survival should be borne by the people of the whole country together. The development of local projects should strive for equality, but it is not possible to make a trial in a certain county and make other counties feel neglected. It is known that the expenses of a certain county are insufficient and it is being helped. Where are those whose expenses are not insufficient? It is only possible to help a certain number of counties and make other counties feel partiality. It is only when the Ding Cao tax items belong to the county, and the power of the high prefectures and counties is jointly held, that those who have been concentrated in the cities and have no place to live can all be sent back to their hometowns. The various bureaus of the mountains, prefectures, and counties can use their talents and abilities to do what they can. Only then can the politics be clear and the local development will naturally be achieved accordingly. This is the saying that the provincial government's official system should be changed and reorganized. The above two points are all about reform. Whether the reasons are sufficient or not, I will not seek to be detailed in my arguments. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency will pay attention to the investigation at any time and in any place. In a month or two, if what I said is not wrong, please report to the Control Yuan and submit it to the court. Moreover, Qingmu has more to say. The regular land tax of Jiangsu Province is more than 11 million yuan. The additional taxes are collected in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, also totaling more than 11 million yuan. Now that the land is being surveyed and the accumulation is being organized, the regular tax will increase, and the additional tax can be reduced even more. The deed tax of the entire province is more than one million yuan. If it is changed to belong to the county, the income will definitely increase. The business tax of the entire province is more than 4 million taels, and it costs a lot to send personnel to collect it. There are even more malpractices in bidding and contracting. If it is changed to belong to the county, the method should avoid harming the people, and the collection will also be more accurate. All of these sayings are taken from the local and used in the local. If the civil administration is carried out in an orderly manner, the national strength will naturally increase invisibly. If it is like the current county, it is like a bird's foot. The virtuous county magistrate is trapped by the economy, bound by laws, and restricted, and there is nothing that can be done. Those who are unworthy are good at perfunctory, accustomed to deception, cruelly oppressing the people, and only seeking to benefit themselves. The provincial government is too high, and the people's hidden feelings are ultimately separated. The examination of the subordinates is also sparse. Only by changing to a two-level system of prefectures and counties can the civil administration atmosphere be refreshed. Therefore, the reform of the two matters must be considered consistently to achieve success. Qingmu's foolishness does not dare to be presumptuous. A thousand thoughts may lead to one success. Silence is difficult to bear. The deep concern for the times and the ardent love for the country make me unaware of the taboos. I only ask for understanding and forgiveness.</p>
<h3>New Early Rice from Pudong Enters the Market</h3>
<p>The new early rice from Pudong in the South City entered the market yesterday. The goods were transported from Yitai Rice Shop in Zhoupu Bridge to Shanghai, totaling thirteen stones of rough rice. It was entrusted to Xinchang Rice Mill in Xuejiabang to be milled and sold. The mill produced eleven stones and five dou of white rice. The rice quality is exceptionally clean, and the grain color is particularly smooth. It is indeed a fresh and good product. Moreover, this is the first batch to enter the market this year, so the market price is also brisk, with a selling price of eleven yuan per stone. It is said that Pudong has had a bumper harvest this year, and the weather has been relatively smooth, resulting in a yield of 60-70%.</p>
<h3>Wu Shangying Passes Through Shanghai on His Way Back to Hangzhou; Will Return to Shanghai in a Few Days and Go South to Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Wu Shangying, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan, needed to go south to attend the annual meetings of the China Science Society and other organizations held in Guangdong and Guangxi this year. He left Beijing on a special express train at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. He stayed overnight and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train to Hangzhou at 7:55 AM yesterday morning. He will return to Shanghai from Hangzhou in a day or two, and then take a boat south. This trip is also to investigate the economic and land administration conditions in various parts of southern China.</p>
<h3>Jiang Bocheng Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Jiang Bocheng, the resident representative of Chairman Chiang in Guangdong and member of the Beiping Military Branch, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong at the beginning of the month, and then hurriedly entered Beijing to fly to Sichuan to meet Chairman Chiang and report on everything. He has completed his official duties and left Sichuan to fly to Hankou, and then changed to the Wusong Jianglun, a ship of the Taikoo Shipping Company, and headed east. According to his residence in Shanghai, Mr. Jiang will not stop in Beijing and will return to Shanghai on the same ship. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon on the 26th. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Jiang will rest for a while and take care of private affairs before returning to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Dance Hall Aviation Donation</h3>
<p>All the dance halls in the city, including both the Chinese and Concession areas, totaling more than fifty, have all joined the one-jiao aviation donation per ticket starting from the 20th. Dance halls and dancers all consider it a patriotic donation, and the amount is very small. Everyone is enthusiastically paying, according to voluntary reports.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Warning: Ning Uses Wired Radio; Ministry of Industry Order Instructs Fishery Protection Agencies to be Informed</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry issued an order to the Ministry of Industry's Fishery Protection Office yesterday: "Regarding the matter of sending typhoon telegrams to various fishing areas, the Ministry of Transportation previously approved a consultation stating that it would be implemented from July 1st. Typhoon warnings will be broadcast by the Central Meteorological Research Institute. Agencies in various fishing areas can install radios to listen to the broadcasts. It is not necessary for the telegraph office to forward telegrams, etc. This has been consulted with the governments of coastal provinces and forwarded for notification. Now, a letter from the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory states: 'Regarding the installation of radio receivers in various fishing grounds, it is indeed an important plan. However, according to my 15 years of experience, it seems that it is better to still use telegrams. The reason is that the warnings issued by the city to the various fishing grounds, if transmitted by shortwave radio, cannot be considered to have reached the fishing grounds without a response. Recently, radio waves are often congested, and messages are often delayed and need to be resent. When issuing warnings, several lines must be sent simultaneously. If there is an error, the danger is extremely serious. Therefore, it is better to forward the telegrams, which is more reliable. If the location of the fishing ground does not have a telegraph office, it may be possible to install a radio receiver and a repeater to request a resend if the message cannot reach. At the same time, I propose that your office order all steamship fishing boats and fishery protection vessels to pay attention to the warnings issued by Shanghai.' This is hereby approved. Regarding the installation of a repeater and paying attention to the warnings issued by Shanghai, the above is still proper and can be used as a reference for installing radio receivers to listen to typhoon telegrams. You are hereby ordered to be informed. This order."</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Qinghai Still Did Not Fly to Shanghai Yesterday; Needs Good Weather Before Leaving Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese national visit aircraft Qinghai was originally scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Shanghai on the 24th. However, due to fog along the way, it was decided to postpone the flight. According to inquiries from related parties by reporters, the aircraft still did not leave Hong Kong yesterday morning. Japanese groups in this city have prepared a grand welcome. It is expected that as soon as the weather is good, it will fly to Shanghai and plans to stay for three or four days.</p>
<h3>Private Residence on Seymour Road: Rent Valuation Remains the Same</h3>
<p>The private residence at No. 8, Lane 815, Seymour Road, was previously valued too high by the Bureau of Public Works Donation Office, with an estimated rent of 4,800 yuan per year. The owner of the house specifically requested the Bureau of Public Works Housing Donation Valuation Committee to re-evaluate. After the committee reviewed the request, it considered that the estimated value was not too high and the original estimate should remain the same. It is rumored that the committee has replied to the Finance Committee and submitted it to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Appeals for Flood Relief from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Xu Jingren, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Relief Committee for Drought Disasters in Various Provinces, telegraphed Hu Guigeng, the manager of Yong An Tang in Shanghai, and Lang Jingshan yesterday, requesting them to relay a message to the Hu Wenhu and Hu Wenbao brothers in Singapore, asking for donations of medicines such as Wan Jin You (Tiger Balm), Bagua Dan (Eight Trigram Pills), and Qing Huo Shui (Heat-Clearing Water) to help the disaster-stricken people. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Mr. Hu Guigeng, Manager of Yong An Tang in Shanghai, and Mr. Lang Jingshan, please quickly forward this to Mr. Hu Wenhu and Mr. Hu Wenbao for their kind attention. This year, the Yangtze River has flooded, and looking at the upstream counties of Tianmen and Hanchuan, all who have visited sigh at the submersion. Today, I turned to Hunan, inquiring and learning that the disaster situation is also severe. The disaster victims have been living in the water for a long time, and diseases are taking lives. It is said that after a flood, there must be a great epidemic. Considering this, I cannot rest easy. I have long admired your deep concern, and your pharmacy's medicines are particularly effective. I respectfully request a generous donation and prompt dispatch to facilitate distribution and save lives. This is a special telegram, asking for your benevolent consideration. Respectfully, Xu Shiying." Mr. Hu received the telegram and has already forwarded it to Singapore, it is said.</p>
<p>This time, the dikes of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River collapsed simultaneously, and the disaster situation is extraordinarily severe. The General and Branch Associations of the Red Swastika Society have jointly organized relief teams to set off in different directions. The first team, led by Han Yongxiang, set off for counties such as Juancheng in Shandong Province to implement relief efforts. The second team, led by Yan Chenglong, set off for the Changyuan area to investigate and distribute emergency relief. The Nanjing Southeast Main Association organized a third team, and Wu Heguang, the general captain, gathered team members and sent Ouyang Dulin to lead the team, carrying a large quantity of medicines to set off for various disaster areas in Hubei. When the Yellow River breached its banks, the branch associations in Shandong Province, such as the Jinan and Jining associations, immediately organized relief teams to set off in different directions to provide dry food and set up shelters to accommodate refugees from various places. The local Shanghai Red Swastika Society is actively raising funds. However, the disaster is extremely severe, and the affected area is vast. It is hoped that all sectors will rise up and work together to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Hubei Association in Shanghai received a joint telegram from various legal entities in Tianmen and 800,000 people in the county, saying (titles omitted) all esteemed sirs: It is said that Tianmen has been known as a "water country" since ancient times, with a low-lying terrain and a dense population of over 800,000. In recent years, disasters have occurred frequently, and the people have not recovered from their difficulties. Unfortunately, this year in June, heavy rain fell for ten consecutive days, and all the county's cultivated land was flooded. In addition, on July 8th, eleven sections of the Xiang embankment belonging to Zhong were breached, pouring down with the force of a high-pitched roof. Although the military and civilians tried their best to build repairs, the water level was more than ten feet higher than the surface of the dikes in various places. Within a few days, they collapsed one after another. The people's houses, grain, livestock, in the county town and various towns and villages were swept away by the flood like fallen leaves in the autumn wind. Only the sound of wailing and cries for help on the water could be heard, colliding with the turbulent waves. Making hundreds of thousands of lives become fish and turtles is truly an unprecedented disaster in hundreds of years. The scene is no less than the breach at Changyuan. What is even more tragic is that the survivors who have been spared have lost their fathers and sons, and their wives and children are gone. Some are staying on the treetops, or clinging to the roofs. During the day, the scorching sun burns their skin, and at night, the cold dew pierces their bones. They drink turbid water to prolong their lives. Those who have been rescued by rescue boats or have struggled to escape and are fortunate enough to escape the danger gather on the remaining dikes, without clothes or food, crying for their children and husbands, feeling that life is worse than death. Now, the water势 has slightly decreased, but the city walls, embankments, and the few remaining houses are still in the midst of the great flood. If the water rises again in a day, there is a danger of submersion. Moreover, after the flood, plagues are easy to occur, and after hunger, bandits are easy to arise. All aspects of sanitation, medicine, post-disaster relief, and disaster relief need to be carried out urgently, and large-scale relief efforts must be made to be effective. Although various agencies and legal entities have tried their best to provide relief, they are also in the disaster area, and all their reserves have been exhausted. A drop in the bucket is of no help to the overall situation. Therefore, on behalf of all the disaster-stricken people in the county, we cry out to the national officials and elders, brothers and sisters, earnestly requesting you to extend your helping hands and jointly rescue the disaster-stricken people, gathering the strength of all to work together for good deeds, so that we can provide for the dead and care for the living. We are infinitely grateful and await your orders."</p>
<p>In addition, a joint telegram was received from Zhang Naiwei, Yang Fengxiang, Deng Bicheng, and all twenty-two members of the Yidu County Flood Relief Emergency Committee (titles omitted), saying: "Our county straddles the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, at the key exit of the Sichuan River. The Qingjiang, Han River, and Yang River run through its south, and the Manao River encircles its north. The mountains within the territory are scattered and extremely barren. The fertile agricultural areas are generally located in the areas bordering the river. Every time we encounter peach and summer floods, we suffer from water disasters. However, since the beginning of history, there has never been a flood as strange and severe as this year's flood. Since the morning of July 1st and until the morning of the 7th, heavy rain fell continuously for four days and nights, causing flash floods and a sudden rise in river water, surging and frightening. The water level was more than seven feet higher than that of the 20th year of the Republic of China. With the addition of rapid thunder, strong winds, and torrential rain, most of the public and private houses in the city and countryside collapsed. People, animals, utensils, bamboo, and wood were swept down the river along both banks. All the dikes were almost completely collapsed. Because the water rose too quickly, the residents could not avoid it in time, and they were tossed about in a vast expanse of water, either raising their hands to wait for help or clinging to the trees to call for help. The cries of children and the weeping of children were unbearable to see and hear. The military and political agencies immediately supervised the team doctors and took various measures to rescue them, and on the 1st and 2nd days, the county government repeatedly reported the situation by telegram. Except for the remote areas where transportation has not yet been restored, we are currently engaged in investigation. All the administrative districts under the county are among the worst affected. The most affected parts include Longwo River, Huangjia River, and Guolu Tan in the first district; Xiongdu, Niejihe, Xiyangping, and Liujin Tan in the second district; Chadian City, Honghua Tao, Gulao Bei, Shanxi Dachong, Shangxia Shawan, Zhaping, and Dujia Tuo in the third district; and Baiyang, Anfu City, Shaqi Ping, Linjia Jia, and Luojia River in the fourth district. The fields and houses were all washed away by the flood. Even the barren land on the mountains, known as highlands, where taro, silkworms, and soap seedlings are planted, were also uprooted and washed into the flood along with the soil, leaving nothing behind. Although the flooded area accounts for only two-thirds of the entire territory, the disaster-stricken locations are spread throughout the county. Currently, we have provided shelter to more than 5,000 disaster victims who have come to the city. It is still difficult to obtain accurate statistics on those whose wives and children are scattered, who have been lost or are missing, or who are fortunate enough to survive but have no food or clothing and no home to return to. With such widespread sorrow and hunger, if we do not receive a quick allocation of large sums of money to provide emergency relief, the survivors will have no hope of survival, and the local order is likely to be unimaginable. We, Naiwei, have decided to establish the Yidu County Flood Relief Emergency Committee according to the resolutions of the local agencies and legal entities to temporarily alleviate the immediate crisis and have reported it. The details will be submitted after the investigation is completed. The magnitude of this disaster is beyond the capacity of one corner. Therefore, we appeal by telegram, earnestly requesting you to find ways to provide relief to benefit the disaster-stricken people and plan for post-disaster recovery. We respectfully lead the 300,000 people of Tuyi, eagerly awaiting your orders."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Lin Genghou, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Zhongying, Gu Wensheng, Xu Kaixian, Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yiqi, Chen Jicheng, Tao Leqin, Chen Binghui, Xu Jutang, and others, in view of the extraordinarily severe floods in various provinces, with disaster victims being displaced and suffering unbearably, have initiated a fundraising entertainment event for flood relief. The initiation states: "Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has fallen everywhere, causing mountain floods to erupt and spread without end. In the Yangtze River basin, such as Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, dikes have collapsed and been submerged, becoming marshlands. The rapid currents have carried away residents who could not escape in time, and hundreds of thousands of people have died. The water devils are everywhere, and it feels as if everywhere one looks, there are corpses. The destruction of houses and the flooding of fields and crops are countless. Since the collapse of the dikes, there has been little clean land in Shandong and Henan. Now, the water is moving southeast, and counties such as Heze, Yuncheng, Juye, Dongping, and Jiaxiang are all severely affected, and there is a growing trend of harming northern Jiangsu. In other places, such as the North River in Guangdong and the Yongding River in Hebei, disasters are also reported. The floods this year are causing disasters throughout the country, and the flood level has broken historical records. The disaster situation is also more serious than in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Now, the summer flood season is still long, and rescue is difficult. The dead among the disaster-stricken people are already gone, but the living are either drifting in different places, suffering from cold and starvation, or are still perched high on mountain peaks, desperately in need of rescue. Sorrowful cries are everywhere, and the misery of the human world is extreme. We believe that although the people of Shanghai are affected by the economic downturn, they still feel as if they are in heaven compared to the disaster-stricken people. The government has already allocated 20,000 yuan for relief expenses, but the disaster area is vast, and the disaster-stricken compatriots number in the tens of millions. Our people should also contribute as much as they can, following in the government's footsteps and working together for disaster relief. In view of this, we intend to hold a fundraising entertainment event for flood relief for one month. All the income from the event will be used for disaster relief, combining charity with entertainment, hoping to gather the strength of all. However, this matter is of great importance, and we rely on everyone's efforts. We hope that celebrities from all walks of life will rise up together to show concern and guide the initiative, so that we can rally everyone to respond. If you are willing to support us, we dare to ask for your signature."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Prevents Suicide: Drawing Alerting Pictures, Depicting the Painful Conditions of Suicide, and Hanging Them in Various Districts to Alert Citizens</h3>
<p>In recent years, the social economy has been exhausted, unemployment has increased, and the weak are in a difficult environment with no way to make a living. After being slightly stimulated, they suddenly develop a sense of world-weariness. Therefore, unfortunate suicide incidents occur almost every day. Especially in this city, where Chinese and foreigners live together and the population is dense, those who are forced to take desperate measures are countless. In view of this, the Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that suicide incidents are detrimental to the future of the country and the nation. Although the authorities pay great attention to this, such as Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, who has published opinions on preventing suicide, and whose thorough discussion can be used as a warning to awaken those who are misguided, it is essential to prevent this trend from growing and to find ways to prevent it. Therefore, the authorities have specially instructed the department to draw various alerting pictures depicting the pain of suicide and make dozens of large posters to be nailed to public places on the roads, alleys, and streets in the city, as well as at wharves, riverbanks, and bridges, to warn citizens who are temporarily pessimistic and suicidal, so that they can turn back from the brink. In the future, suicide incidents may be reduced through this passive prevention.</p>
<h3>The Police Strictly Prohibit the Abuse of Car Horns</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of noise in the city, the Acting Superintendent of the Police Department of the Public Works Department has recently devised a method to strictly prohibit the abuse of car horns when unnecessary and the excessive volume of horns. Article 30 of the Traffic Regulations of the Concession will be actively implemented to prohibit the abuse of horns and causing annoyance. The plan has now been submitted by the Acting Superintendent to the Police Committee and then to the Board of Directors for approval and will be implemented soon. The Acting Superintendent also stated that Article 40 of the Traffic Regulations is difficult to implement because the sound standard is difficult to determine. Therefore, he has investigated with the Public Works Department whether there is a machine that can determine the sound level and record it in units for reference. If there is such a machine with a suitable price and size, the sound of car horns will be uniform and will not be a problem. The following is a record of Articles 30 and 40 of the Traffic Regulations, so that drivers know what to follow: Article 30: Drivers are not allowed to use horns, bells, or other signals when unnecessary, or to use such signals in a way that causes annoyance. Article 40: Cars must be equipped with a device that can emit an audible and sufficient warning when the car is approaching. The device must be approved by the Bureau. Except for fire and police vehicles, it is not allowed to use gongs, steam horns, whistles, or alarm bells.</p>

<h3>What Was Seen During the Day Was Jupiter</h3>
<p>In the past two days, a star was discovered in Shanghai during the day. Many people stopped on the road to watch. At 12:00 noon, the star was right overhead. Even during the day, the starlight was still bright and radiant. According to astronomers, this star is Jupiter, one of the eight major planets. Its path is the most changeable. This star can be seen with the naked eye during the day. Usually, because its orbit is either too far south or too far north, people do not pay attention to it. Now it has moved overhead, and people can see it because it is closer. In fact, according to astronomical observations, this is a very normal thing.</p>
<h3>American Heiress Arrives in Shanghai Today to Travel the World with Her Newlywed Husband</h3>
<p>Alice, the world's richest American woman, and her newlywed husband, Grenville, are traveling the world. They were originally scheduled to take a China Aviation Company plane from Guangzhou to Shanghai yesterday to visit. According to a reporter's inquiry to the company, Alice is currently stranded in Shantou due to foggy weather along the way. The company's southbound plane did not fly to Guangzhou that day, so the schedule was delayed. It is expected that the northbound plane carrying Ms. Ai will arrive this afternoon.</p>
<h3>A Rotten Infant Was Found in the Sewer: Confirmed to Have Been Stillborn and Abandoned by Someone Unknown</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, three or five naughty children were playing the game of rolling copper coins in front of No. 307, south of the French Tibetan Temple on Grole Road in the French Concession. One of the children's copper coins rolled into the sewer hole on the east side of the road. The child then opened the sewer cover to retrieve the fallen copper coin, reaching down and pushing aside the floating dirt. A strange and foul smell immediately hit his nose. Upon closer inspection, it was the corpse of a female child who had been dead for many days. The body had already rotted, and the children were frightened and ran away after discovering it. The residents of the area reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to send laborers to retrieve the body. After examination, the corpse was a stillborn fetus, with the umbilical cord still attached to the navel. However, the placenta had rotted and could not be found. It must have been the stillborn child of a private birth from a nearby family, who was thrown into the sewer to reduce traces. The body was sent to the mortuary. Yesterday morning, the French police reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to inspect the corpse at the mortuary. It was confirmed that the body was indeed a stillborn female infant, and the court ordered that it be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial.</p>
<h3>Women Who Have Abortions Must Be Investigated at the Hospital to See If They Took Medicine to Induce It</h3>
<p>Wang Liu Shi, a 33-year-old Anhui woman who lived in the back building of No. 607 Xi Aixiansi Road in the French Concession, carried out the body of her 14-year-old adopted daughter, Xiao Zhen Baozi, who had died of measles, with her husband, Wang Li Bao (39 years old), on the morning of April 23 this year and abandoned it in the open space opposite No. 166 Jufu Road, Xi Aixiansi Road. The police discovered it, sent the body to the mortuary, and reported it to the court for verification. Since the family could not be found, the Shantang charity took custody of the body. Later, the French police found out and arrested the Wang couple and brought them to the Second Special District Court, where they were prosecuted for the crime of abandoning a corpse. As a result, Wang Li Bao was sentenced to six months in prison and is currently serving his term. Wang Liu Shi was acquitted. After being released, she was recommended to work as an amah for a Russian named Fulaifeng Dala (transliteration) at No. 114 Geluoxi Road in the French Concession. Recently, Wang Liu Shi became pregnant for three months. Because of the hard work during the day, the fetus was affected, but it did not miscarry, causing her to feel exhausted and weak. She asked someone to get a prescription for abortion medicine and took it. As a result, her condition worsened and she became unconscious. The Russian employer discovered this and reported it to the French police, who sent her to the Guangci Hospital. The doctor tried to remove the dead fetus from her abdomen, and she was able to escape danger and be safe. She stayed in the hospital to recover. The French police believed that Wang Liu Shi had committed an abortion and sent detectives to bring Liu Shi back to the police station the day before yesterday. Yesterday, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Qiu Huan Ying brought her to trial. The lawyer from the Police Department, Yao Xun Di, stated the case and prosecuted her for the crime of abortion under Article 288 of the Criminal Law. According to Liu Shi's confession, the fetus in her abdomen slipped seven days ago. On the 4th of this month, she passed Hadong Road and met Mr. Yao, who had a fortune-telling stall. She told him about her situation and begged him to prescribe medicine for treatment. He initially refused, saying that someone must be responsible for guaranteeing before he could give a prescription. She then asked her sister, Xue Liu Shi, who lived at No. 12 An'nan Road, to vouch for her. Yao then gave her a prescription. The next day, after taking the medicine, she became unconscious. The employer reported it to the police station and sent her to the hospital. At that time, she had already died and knew nothing. She was saved by the doctor, etc. At this point in the interrogation, the lawyer from the Police Department expressed his opinion, saying that there were key points that needed to be studied. First, whether the prescription taken by the defendant was actually an abortion prescription. Second, to summon the doctor from Guangci Hospital to testify and ask whether the defendant's fetus had already slipped or was induced by taking medicine. The court reported this to the court and ordered a retrial on the 29th. The defendant was exempted from bail and was not allowed to leave her original residence without permission.</p>
<h3>Arrests Made in Counterfeit Coin Case: Xu Wensheng, the Guarantor for the Rental House, Detained Awaiting Trial by the Original Trial Judge</h3>
<p>The case of the counterfeit coin manufacturing organization at No. 806 Zhoujiazui Road was solved by the Chief Inspectorate, and nine employees of the organization, including Zhang Xueyuan and worker Yang A'gen, were arrested and sent to the First Special District District Court for interrogation, awaiting sentencing. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Xu Wensheng, the pawnshop guarantor involved in the organization, is a shareholder of Hong Taiyuan Department Store at No. 1399 Roberts Road. He is suspected of being involved in the manufacture of counterfeit coins. After investigation by Chinese and foreign detectives of the Chief Inspectorate, he was found to be suspicious and was detained in the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. The lawyer from the Public Works Department, Wang Yaotang, filed a public prosecution based on Article 30, Section 2, and Article 195 of the Criminal Law for assisting in the counterfeiting of Chinese national currency and disrupting the financial market, etc., and stated that the case was being heard by Judge Jiang, and the facts were clear, so he requested an adjournment. Questioning Xu Wensheng, he confessed that he was a native of Jiangyin, 31 years old, and a shareholder and manager of Hong Taiyuan Department Store. The housing of the organization was actually entrusted to him by an old friend, Yang Jinwen, to be the guarantor. He does not know where Yang Jinwen is now. Judge Xiao Xie Fen ordered that he be returned to custody and that the retrial be held by the original trial judge next Friday.</p>
<h3>Huishan Police Arrested Traffickers and Rescued Trafficked Women: The Traffickers Were Detained Separately, and the Trafficked Persons Were Sent to the Jiliang Institute</h3>
<p>Huang Fugen and Xu Bingnan, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station, arrested six people involved in human trafficking, including Chen Ziren from Qingpu and his wife, Zhu Shi, from Songjiang, Huang Fulin from Chongming, Chen Dai Shi from Nanjing, Zhang Jinfa from Wuxi, and Fan A'xing from Zhenjiang, at Yangshupu Road Pingliang Road and other places at around 6:00 a.m. the day before yesterday.

Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer from the Public Works Department, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendants had been living in the French Concession and were planning to send the victims to Dalian on a ship from Huangpei Wharf for the purpose of selling them for profit. He requested an adjournment for the case and that the four women, Sheng Xiaomei, etc., be sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary care before their families claim them. According to Sheng Xiaomei, she lived in Zhoujiazhuang, her hometown, and her husband worked in a certain number on Lafayette Road in the French Concession. She came to Shanghai from her hometown on the 18th and met the defendant Chen Ziren on the way. They went to a noodle shop to eat snacks. Later, she stayed with the defendant Chen Dai Shi for five days, who said that she would recommend her to work as a maid in Dalian, where she could get a good salary. Hu A'mei said that she was from Bachi Township in Pudong, where her parents and siblings lived at home. A month ago, the defendant Huang Fulin lured her to Zhoupu and took her to his home, where she stayed for about a month. The defendant Chen Dai Shi also came. At that time, she was sent to Dalian as a maid. She did not know anything else. Hu Laizi Di said that she lived in a shack in Yangshupu and was brought to Xiaoshanzi's house by a fat woman in a matchmaking shop. She was sold to the defendant Chen Dai Shi for 60 yuan and lived there for seven days. Both her parents were dead. The defendant Zhang Jinfa also came twice. At that time, she was sent to Dalian as a maid, who said that she could eat well and dress well. Tang Zhang Shi said that she lived at No. 32 Bashan Bridge in the French Concession and used to work in a foreign factory. She had a husband at home. The day before yesterday, the defendant Fan A'xing came and asked her to go to Huangpu Wharf to talk, so she went with him. On the way, she saw him whispering to the defendant Chen Dai Shi, but she did not know what it was about, etc. When questioned, the defendants all gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Fen Fen ordered that they be detained separately and that the case be investigated and verified at a later date. The four women, Sheng Xiaomei, etc., together with the 8-year-old girl Chen Rui Zhen, were all temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary care.</p>
<h3>Judge's Persuasion Works Wonders: Husband and Wife Reconcile, Divorce Case Ends in Court After Heartfelt Appeals Moved Both Parties</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhaogeng, a native of Zhenhai, 28 years old, residing at No. 11, Lane 59, Huade Road, works as a "western boy" (likely a waiter or steward on a ship) at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, earning a monthly salary of 50 to 60 yuan. In 1933, he met Wu Xingdi, a woman from Ningbo, who was 23 years old at the time. They fell in love at first sight. Zhou then engaged a matchmaker, and on March 27 of the same year, they held a formal wedding at the Zhejiang Hotel in Xiaodongmen, Shanghai. Subsequently, he lived with Zhou as a temporary resident in Yichang until April 19 of last year, when he returned with his mother. Recently, Zhou became unemployed, leading to financial difficulties, and the couple often had quarrels. Unable to endure poverty, Wu hired a lawyer to file a petition with the First Special District Local Court requesting permission to divorce Zhou Zhaogeng. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Yuhai specially opened the 14th Civil Court to investigate. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present. First, the plaintiff, Wu Xingdi, testified that after marrying Zhou, she gave birth to a child on March 19 of this year. Only a few months later, the defendant often beat and injured her after childbirth. She sought medical treatment, and although she has recovered, it is difficult to live together in the future, so she had no choice but to request a divorce, and so on. The defendant, Zhou Zhaogeng, claimed that he used to work as a "western boy" on a ship, earning 50 to 60 yuan a month. Unexpectedly, the ship recently sailed to Sichuan and was damaged en route, resulting in his unemployment. He has always cherished his wife and has not beaten her. He requested a ruling for them to live together, and so on. Judge Zhang said that arguments and minor matters are inevitable between husband and wife, so why should they rashly divorce? He advised both parties in court to put aside their differences and reconcile. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were moved and expressed their willingness to reconcile, and the case was thus peacefully resolved.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government's People's Welfare Association Seeks to Relieve Rickshaw Pullers: Establishes Rickshaw Management Office with an Allocated Budget of 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government has established the People's Welfare Affairs Committee to promote the welfare of the common people. The committee believes that in terms of transportation in the city, the operation of rickshaws not only requires safeguarding the livelihoods of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers but also requires finding ways to improve the technology of rickshaw construction. Therefore, the committee has established a Rickshaw Management Committee to supervise design and other duties and will organize a Rickshaw Management Office to carry out the duties. It is reported that the Rickshaw Management Office will be established soon. The Municipal Government is currently drafting the organizational rules of the Rickshaw Management Office. The position of director will be concurrently held by Xu Peihuang, the director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. The office will be divided into technical, inspection, and general affairs sections. In order to facilitate the reorganization, the Municipal Government will allocate 50,000 yuan from the People's Welfare Affairs Fund for initial expenses.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry: Crew Members Show Courage and Righteousness. A Young Woman Attempts Suicide After an Argument, and a Crew Member Jumps into the Water to Save Her.</h3>
<p>At 4:14 PM yesterday, when the Municipal Ferry's Chunbei Line's No. 16 Bolun ferry arrived at the Beijing Road dock, a passenger, Xiao Chen, 23 years old, wearing a pink silk cheongsam, white satin shoes, and flesh-colored stockings, jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. The crew noticed and immediately turned the boat around to catch up. A staff member, Sun Ashu, saw that the person who jumped into the river was still floating on the surface, immediately grabbed a lifebuoy and jumped into the river, pulling the woman's hair to save her. The crew members then used first aid methods, and she soon regained consciousness. She was then sent to the Water Patrol Police Station, where her address was inquired and her family was notified to pick her up. It is reported that the young woman had an argument with her husband the night before, so she suddenly jumped into the river. Fortunately, the Municipal Ferry staff were familiar with the water and jumped into the Huangpu River, and were able to rescue her; otherwise, it would have been impossible to save her.</p>
<h3>Collapsed Rickshaw and Tiger Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Society Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Collapsed Rickshaw and Tiger Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Society convened its founding meeting yesterday at the original site of the New World Great Beijing Opera House. Directors and supervisors were elected. Attendees included Liu Zhongying from the Federation of National Product Manufacturers, Cao Zhigong from the Citizens' Federation, Ge Futian from the Nantong Fellow-Provincials Association, Chen Shude from the Haimen Fellow-Provincials Association, and more than 400 members. Shen Yong, Zou Shisong, Jing Qixiang, Wu Zhengyuan, Yang Chunfu, Chen Baoshan, and Chen Xiaoming served as chairpersons. After the rituals, Chairman Shen Yong delivered the opening speech, saying, "Everyone, we have all come here today with great joy because our request to cancel the additional taxes imposed by the Municipal Council has been satisfactorily resolved. This makes us grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of all sectors of society. At the same time, it also shows that the concession authorities are still able to understand the suffering of our workers. Indeed, given the current situation, with so few passengers and goods, our collapsed rickshaws and tiger rickshaws are already feeling the burden of the original taxes, so how can we bear an increase of 100% and 50% in taxes? Fortunately, the negotiations have gone well, and there will be no further tax increases, so we can temporarily set aside this concern. Furthermore, what does it mean that so many of our colleagues are gathered here today for this meeting? We believe that people in every industry should have a collective organization. With an organization, we can exert our strength; otherwise, we will be scattered and insignificant. The success of our negotiations this time is due, on the one hand, to the enthusiastic assistance of all sectors of society and the understanding of the authorities, and on the other hand, to the united participation and orderly steps of our colleagues. It can be seen that unity and mutual assistance are the most important things for our colleagues. Therefore, we are formally establishing this Mutual Aid Society today to unite our strength and promote the development of our business." Guests then gave speeches. Ge Futian, the representative of the Nantong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, said, "This time, your colleagues felt that they could not bear the additional taxes imposed by the Public Concession authorities, so they all came to the Fellow-Provincials Association for assistance. Since most of you are fellow provincials, our association naturally has an unshirkable duty. At that time, we sent a special letter to the Shanghai Concession Ratepayers' Association on behalf of your colleagues, explaining your intentions and difficult situation, and requesting them to negotiate and stop the tax increase. It was indeed rare. After receiving the letter, the Ratepayers' Association attached great importance to this case and felt that your industry was in too much distress to withstand the additional taxes, so they put forward a dissenting opinion and demanded that the Municipal Council cancel the agreement to increase taxes. Later, thanks to the righteous words of the Chinese directors and committee members, such as Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Lin Kanghou, and He Huiban, the wish to cancel the tax increase was realized. Your industry was able to reduce its burden, and the Fellow-Provincials Association is very pleased. Now that your colleagues have taken a further step to seek permanent unity and have formally established a Mutual Aid Society, and the number of participants is so enthusiastic, the future is certainly unlimited. However, I feel that there is no end to the affairs of society. After your association is established today, there will naturally be many tasks that everyone will work together to do, such as how to seek the development of the industry, improve livelihoods, and other matters for the public good of the industry. Therefore, in addition to congratulating you on your success here today, I hope that everyone will uphold the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, work hard, and strive to achieve the final mutual benefit." (Speeches by Liu Shenying, Chen Jiufeng, etc. are omitted)</p>
<p>Resolutions of Various Cases: (1) Discussed the draft constitution, which was amended and passed as originally drafted.

<h3>The Site of the Former Xiamen Road Western Jail Will Be Used to Build a Fire Department Building: Funds Are Not Yet Available, but the Principle Has Been Decided.</h3>
<p>At the regular meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 24th of this month, it was decided in principle to designate the site of the former Xiamen Road Western Jail for the construction of the Central Fire Department. However, issues such as the architectural style, volume, and construction of other houses were temporarily postponed, and Messrs. Kenei, Gillanley, and Zhanbu were elected to form a committee to investigate the organization and funding of the Fire Department.</p>
<p>Construction Plan</p>
<p>It is found that the construction of the Western section of the Huade Road Prison will be completed soon. The Xiamen Road West half will be moved in immediately. The old houses left behind, due to years of disrepair, will be demolished. Therefore, the director of the Fire Department has suggested building a new building on the site as the central station. According to the Fire Department Director's submission, after the completion of the central station in the future, there should be a large machine room, so that the existing central station and branch stations on Tiantong Road and Xinzha Road can be moved in. Eight stories of dormitories and residences should be built above the machine room to accommodate firefighters and their families. It is also planned to build another general office building with a total of seven floors, including a special machine room for the installation of special equipment and ambulances, as well as alarm bells, electrical rooms, training rooms, and dormitories. In addition, there are workshops, storage rooms, and dormitories for Chinese staff and their families.</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>Since this plan was proposed by the director of the Fire Department and discussed by the Security Committee, the director of the Public Works Department immediately expressed his opinion, stating that the Fire Department's equipment was developing too quickly and the costs were increasing too much. If all the houses were built according to the Fire Department Director's plan, the total cost would be 3 million yuan, not including interest. Therefore, according to his proposal, it is proposed to first build a central fire department building, the size of which should be twice the total of the existing stations. All other construction will be discussed after the central station is established in the future.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Development</p>
<p>The director of the Finance Department also felt that the Fire Department's equipment showed a phenomenon of extraordinary development, and said that whether the staff of the department could be reduced should be investigated. He generally agreed with the proposal of the director of the Public Works Department. However, the director of the Fire Department said that the development of the Fire Department seemed to be too fast, but this was actually because the department's effectiveness was established too late. Therefore, he could only partially agree with the proposal of the director of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Principle Approved</p>
<p>In principle, according to the plan of the director of the Fire Department, a central fire department building will be built, with a total of nine floors, requiring a total construction cost of 1 million yuan. If the number of dormitories and residences on the upper floors can be reduced, the cost can be saved by 200,000 yuan. According to the opinion of the director of the Public Works Department, this plan is not too extravagant, because the situation of the existing stations is very crowded. In the future, when the new building is established, all stations will be moved in, accounting for three-quarters of the area of the new building, and only one-quarter will be reserved for future business expansion. However, the director of the Finance Department stated that it was impossible to raise such a large expenditure in this year's budget, and expressed concern about the expansion of the Fire Department's expenses, hoping that the department could reduce its administration and save money. At that time, the chairman stated that before there was any certainty about the financial issues, it seemed unnecessary to discuss the detailed rules for the construction of the central fire department building in depth. However, in order to allow the director of the Public Works Department to foresee what the site of the former Xiamen Road Western Jail would be used for in the future, so as to engage in design, it was decided to first stipulate in principle that the site would be designated for the construction of the central fire department. All other matters were temporarily postponed. This decision has been recommended by the Committee on Public Utilities to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has expressed its agreement.</p>

<h3>Nephew Extorts Uncle - Continued Trial - Defendant Deeply Ashamed and Remorseful, Claiming It Was a Moment of Anger</h3>
<p>Chen Zhilian, the owner of Huafeng Soap Factory, has recently received threatening letters from gangs demanding huge sums of money. On the 20th of last month, a bomb was hung at the entrance of the factory's wholesale store at No. 33, Lane 237, Guangdong Road. On the 4th of this month, the gang stuffed bamboo strips into the engine cylinder of Chen's bulletproof car, rendering it unable to move. After Chen reported to the General Inspector's Office for investigation, it was learned that this incident was committed by Chen's nephew, Chen Mengyu (also known as Mengyu and Yuansheng), the owner of Jinlang Cosmetics. Detective Su Changsheng, Li Yidong, and Detective Li Jincheng of the Chinese division arrested Chen Mengyu at No. 30, Pushi Village, Pushi Road. At the same time,</p>
<p>Collaborators</p>
<p>Wu Depei (Chen Zhilian's nephew), Song Nianhong (Jinlang Company's accountant), and a woman, Zhu Wangshi (the mother-in-law of Mengyu's concubine), were also arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the chief judge of the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, opened the First Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Chen Mengyu also hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. First, the police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that the police were prosecuting the four defendants in accordance with Article 346 of the new criminal law. He also stated that during the adjournment, all defendants except Zhu Wangshi had written confessions. Chen Mengyu admitted that</p>
<p>Threatening Letters</p>
<p>Six letters were received by the plaintiff, but only admitted to sending two of them, claiming that the other four letters were sent by someone else. The police compared the four letters with the handwriting of the defendants and confirmed that they did not match. However, because the defendants bought a bulletproof car for the plaintiff, they hung the bomb at the door, and actually intended to kill the plaintiff. As for the reason for not keeping the appointment, it was because Song Nianhong was afraid of being caught by the police and advised Chen Mengyu not to take the risk. Therefore, no one came when the plaintiff waited twice. When Chen Mengyu made and sent the bomb, Wu Depei and Song Nianhong were accomplices. As for the point of stuffing bamboo strips into the cylinder, Chen Mengyu denied having done this, but</p>
<p>Chen Can Drive a Car</p>
<p>And Repair It - This Situation May Have Been Done By Him, Which Is Also Possible. The police are currently investigating whether the defendants intended to kidnap the plaintiff, so they requested permission for another adjournment. Then, Chen Zhilian testified that Chen Mengyu was his own nephew. They had separated their families long ago, and all expenses for his schooling, marriage, and opening a store were borne by him. He had served as the captain of an anti-smuggling battalion. In May of this year, he borrowed 3,000 yuan from him, but he refused because he did not keep his promises and feared that the money would be used for illegal activities. Unexpectedly, he would do this to him. After</p>
<p>Discovering the Bomb</p>
<p>Because it was rumored outside that this matter was done by Chen Mengyu, he asked if it was really done by him, so as to avoid further investigation and avoid affecting his reputation, but he firmly denied it. Now it turned out to be his doing, which was really unexpected. He believed that Wu Depei had nothing to do with it, but he was deeply addicted to smoking opium. Recently, because it was inconvenient to smoke in his hometown, he came to Shanghai to smoke opium at his nephew's place. Because of this relationship, he could not report him, and so on. When questioned, Chen Mengyu confessed that his uncle had treated him very well, but he did this because of a moment of confusion. Now that he thinks about it, he feels very sorry for his uncle. Wu Depei had nothing to do with it. The purpose of this letter was only to vent his anger, and there were no other malicious intentions, and so on. After questioning Wu Depei, Song Nianhong, Zhu Wangshi, and others, Judge Qian ordered an adjournment for further questioning. Wu Depei and Zhu Wangshi were each allowed to post a 500-yuan bail, and the rest were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Swift Liquidation of Minghua Bank</h3>
<p>Supervisor Qiu Zhenglun Obeys Orders</p>
<p>After the Shanghai General Branch and the Qingjinping branch of Minghua Commercial Savings Bank suspended operations, the Ministry of Finance, according to the complaint of depositor Yuan Haiquan that the bank delayed liquidation and hindered creditor's rights, requested that the supervisor be ordered to supervise the bank to expedite the liquidation. Minister Kong Xiangxi has transferred the case to comply, and the supervising commissioner, Qiu Zhenglun, has obeyed orders. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau also received a ministerial order to comply.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ratepayers Write to Municipal Council on Behalf of Rickshaw Pullers' Association, Requesting Three Matters Be Given Special Consideration to Accord with the Purpose of Establishing a Mutual Aid Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to Mr. Felippo, Acting General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession, saying, "Dear Sir, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Special District Public Rickshaw Pullers' Association, which states: 'In order to improve the organization, our association has elected a delegation of members, and the delegation has elected 110 people as directors to form the board of directors. We are now submitting the list of directors for your review and requesting that you ask the Municipal Council to implement the following three matters: (1) The new directors of the Public Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society should be established on August of this year and implement projects that directly benefit the rickshaw pullers. (2) The relief funds for August should be retained and decided after the new board of directors is established. (3) He Wushan, a rickshaw puller representative who was detained on official business, should be rescued and the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society should find a way to bail him out. The reasons for the above three items are as follows: (1) The organization of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, as the name suggests, should be based on the rickshaw pullers themselves. During the transition period, it is okay to ask for outside help. The directors of the Municipal Council, in view of the fact that the original directors' distribution was too unrepresentative of public opinion, agreed to reorganize on June 24 of this year. Therefore, the original directors should immediately transfer the accounts and other items. Moreover, the original board of directors has been running for more than 10 months, and the transfer procedures are not complicated. One month is more than enough to handle the procedures, but they deliberately delay, are reluctant to leave, and obstruct the progress, harming the interests of the rickshaw pullers who paid. The Municipal Council resolved to reorganize on June 24, and the order has already been issued, but the original board of directors deliberately delays, which is a clear violation of the Municipal Council's order. If the new board of directors delays taking over, the money contributed by the rickshaw pullers may be wasted. Even with various improvements and good implementation, they may not be able to promote it. (2) All the relief funds of the Mutual Aid Society have been collected for 12 months. Now that the association has been ordered to reorganize, the relief funds for August should be taken care of by the rickshaw business association and retained by the collecting bank, and then decided after the new board of directors is formally established. (3) He Wushan, a rickshaw puller propagandist of the Public Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society who was detained on official business, has already completed the public prosecution part. He is now detained for private prosecution, and the court ordered him to pay bail, but he has not been released because he cannot find a guarantor. The Rickshaw Committee of the Municipal Council should order the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society to find a way to bail him out, provide relief, and clarify right and wrong. Thinking that the Municipal Council established the Rickshaw Committee and implemented the 13 new articles to improve the treatment of rickshaw pullers out of humanitarianism, and specially appointed Maxi, Zhu Maocheng, and Wang Zhiren as members to specialize in this matter, the reason is that these three people are kind-hearted, exhausted their efforts, managed it, and achieved success. Countless rickshaw pullers have improved their treatment and received benefits. The rickshaw puller representatives have repeatedly submitted petitions and offered opinions, which have been adopted, and have been recognized as the official representatives of the rickshaw pullers. Zhu Maocheng sent letters to the leaders of the representatives, Cang Gongwen, Xu Zhulin, Zhu Fengxiang, and He Wushan, to specialize in publicity work, distribute leaflets printed by Zhu Maocheng to resist the capitalists, and instruct them to organize a petition group to support the committee, which resulted in troublemakers from unknown sources letting out the tires of rickshaws along the way and blaming the rickshaw puller representatives, resulting in their arrest by the police and trial by the court. Fortunately, the great philanthropist Zhu Shuqiao made efforts to rescue them, so that they were also detained. Fortunately, social enthusiasts such as Yu Gongqiaqing came forward to explain and released all those detained, sentencing only He Wushan to three months in prison. He Wushan refused to accept the appeal and was sentenced to three years of probation. He appealed again and the original sentence was upheld, resulting in execution. The fact that He Wushan was sentenced contains injustice and is indescribable, and the three months of imprisonment he suffered was due to official business. At present, the term of imprisonment has expired. For the private prosecution part, the court requires a shop to provide a guarantee, but He Wushan is a rickshaw puller, so how can he find a guarantor? The philanthropist Zhu Gongshuqiao, who had made efforts in the past, has already passed away. He Wushan suffered injustice for the public good and for the sake of the Rickshaw Committee. The Rickshaw Committee should be responsible for finding a guarantor to release him. More than ten days have passed, and he is still detained. However, Zhu Maocheng, the Rickshaw Committee, and Zhang Dengying, the secretary-general of the Mutual Aid Society, turned a deaf ear and did not think of rescuing him. Where is the original intention of establishing the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society? Furthermore, Zhang Dengying, the secretary-general, is supported by the rickshaw pullers and receives a salary of 320 yuan per month, but he still claims to be fulfilling his obligations. He does not know how to be grateful. He does not think of rescuing his subordinate rickshaw puller propagandist, who has suffered such injustice. The intention of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society is to do what it wants. Therefore, we hereby send a letter to the directors of your association, requesting that they examine and handle the matter, which will be a great merit.'" Because of the foregoing reasons, the letter was received. It is found that the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society was established for the benefit of the rickshaw pullers and is maintained by the rickshaw pullers' sweat and blood. The Municipal Council should give special consideration to the opinions of the rickshaw pullers in order to conform to the purpose of establishing the Mutual Aid Society. We send you a copy of the list of directors of the association for your reference and request that you expedite the handling of the matter. This is to Mr. Felippo, Acting General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the Shandong area is cloudy with showers and swirls of wind due to a small low-pressure system passing through and moving northeastward. The Yangtze River basin and the East China Sea are cloudy and hot, with gentle southeasterly seasonal winds. The two hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean are still moving northwestward.

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zheng Yimei)</p>
<p>Modern women, in this summer, often wear pure white gloves, covering their jade hands, while their feet are barefoot, without socks. What is abundant there is diminished here. Observing this further strengthens my belief.</p>
<p>The asphalt road is wet with rain, and the road is bright and shiny, like a mirror. Cars and horses pass over it, and their reflections are clearly visible. Illuminated by neon lights at night, it is even more colorful. This is also a symbol of material civilization.</p>
<p>When going out, the weather seems sunny and rainy, which is most hateful. If you bring rain gear and the sun suddenly shines, you will feel that what you are carrying is extremely cumbersome. If you don't bring rain gear and a shower suddenly falls, you will be drenched all over and unable to move. However, this kind of situation is not what the automobile class talks about.</p>
<p>Kunshan is very close to Shanghai, but it is impossible to enjoy the conjoined lotus planted by Gu Zhongying, not to mention the pines of Huangshan, the elms of Luofu, the peonies of Luoyang, and the cherry blossoms of Yingdao. Perhaps it is because I am vulgar that heaven deliberately withholds the blessing of sight!</p>
<p>When I hold the pen to write essays, I often see the beautiful neighbor dressing up and standing leisurely by the railing. However, I dare not engage in fantasies, so I hang a picture of a beauty on the wall to look at, and then everything returns to illusion and silence.</p>
<p>Watching movies and dramas and watching Peking opera differ in the newness of their minds by at least a century.</p>
<h3>Record of the Martyr Jin Liang</h3>
<p>— Tiansheweng</p>
<p>I'm afraid that we won't find a martyr nowadays. In the decades before, it was common to hear and see in the society. Therefore, in miscellaneous books and notes, there are often records of the facts of martyrs. This is not the brush and ink of literati who love things, but it is indeed an indelible fact. Today, when the new morality has not been completed, I think that these old moralities such as "loyalty," "filial piety," "festival," "righteousness," "diligence," and "thrift" should not be overthrown. Chairman Chiang's advocacy of "new life" is indeed an urgent task today.</p>
<p>Sixty or seventy years ago, a towering martyr was born in my hometown. The style of chastity is enough to illuminate the ages. Now the tomb of the martyr is located on the north bank of Cihu. The people of the town go to worship her in spring and autumn. In order to promote the potential virtue, I wrote it out to shame the women of the world who have no chastity!</p>
<p>The martyr Jin Liang's husband was a fisherman who had been a guest in other ports for a long time and never returned. Her mother-in-law was a woman who rented out pearl flower jewelry and was licentious by nature. Although she was a widow, she was familiar with a pawnshop clerk in the city. The martyr was very dissatisfied with her mother-in-law's behavior and often advised her honestly, but her mother-in-law refused to listen. On the contrary, she was concerned about her daughter-in-law's eyes and ears and was afraid of spreading the word, which would affect her own reputation. So she discussed with her adulterer and came up with a method of "going with the flow." The adulterer was very happy to hear this. It was like killing two birds with one stone and enjoying the beauty. So he often tempted the martyr in every possible way and used sweet words to seduce her. Who knew that the martyr was as beautiful as a peach and plum and as cold as frost? Not only did the clerk have an unpleasant time and was scolded severely, but even her mother-in-law was ridiculed. Her mother-in-law had no other way to deal with it and became angry with shame. At first, she still used coercive means, but it was still ineffective. Later, she imprisoned her in the cellar and often used red-hot pliers to scald her lower body indiscriminately. Over time, her lower body was scorched and rotten, and there was no complete skin. The miserable pain and crying made people sour. Later, the neighbors all complained and, while her mother-in-law was out, they entered the house, opened the cellar, and saw that the martyr could no longer move and her lower body was festering and unbearable to look at. So they used a tatami to lift her to the county government to extend her grievances. The county official was very angry and arrested the adulterer and adulteress and punished them according to law. The martyr was promoted to the county, did not say a word, and then died. The people of the town admired her integrity and buried her bones on the shore of Cihu outside Beiguo and wrote "Tomb of the Martyr Jin Liang" in numbers.</p>

<h3>The Frog Almost Came from Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Jiang Danshu</p>
<p>I read a news report in this newspaper on July 8, which stated: "A terrible sound inside Xiaobang in Pudong's Qinciyang Temple! A big green frog scared many villagers to death. A brave man, Chen, caught it, and the people's hearts were greatly settled. The four feet stretched out about a foot long, and when it called, it roared like an angry ox, and the sound vibrated for miles." I am not a naturalist, and I am certainly not a detective in the animal world, but I can conclude that this frog came from Huangshan in Huizhou or places like Huangshan. Seven out of ten, there is a poem to prove it!</p>
<p>The first time I saw the face of Huangshan, I learned to be like Tai Zhen. The cinnabar particles are refreshing, and the flowing water is always new. I brought up the Wu costume dance, and my ears heard the vibration of the frog drums. I washed away the dust and also thought about it, as if I were a citizen of Getian!</p>
<p>This is the impromptu poem I recited last year on this day when I visited Huangshan, after taking a hot spring bath under the thatched shed (Ziyun Temple). What is meant by "hearing the frog drums vibrate"? As soon as we arrived at Huangshan, we took a hot spring bath that we had never taken before in our lives. This hot spring is a cinnabar spring, not a sulfur spring. The taste of the touch on the skin is truly indescribable. At this time, just when the setting sun was in the mountains and the breeze was blowing gently, there was a large stream next to the spring. At that time, it was a great drought, and the water in the stream was very small. Only jagged rocks were seen, and the sound of a majestic "boom boom" suddenly started in the east, and a majestic "boom boom" sound started in the west, just like the appearance of an ox roaring in the article above. At first, I couldn't guess what the sound was. So I asked the porter we hired locally: What is this strange sound? He replied: It's a frog calling! Asked: Is the worm sound so loud? Answer: This is a "rock frog." I'm used to hearing it here! Asked: How big is it? Answer: Very, very big, several times bigger than ordinary field chickens! In such a question and answer, I didn't realize that the dusk was gradually closing, and the moonlight suddenly opened. "Boom boom boom boom," sang in the east and echoed in the west. This courageous and energetic sound is enough to make people get up and dance when they hear field chickens, and even more to make people think of the aspirations of King Goujian of Yue, who used an angry frog to encourage the army in those days. Unfortunately, today's angry frog is both ignored by few people and does not know how to love itself. It also wants to take advantage of the trend to come to Shanghai to see the mundane world, but it does not know how to ask about the customs when entering the country. It happened to land on the shore of the semi-rural Pudong first, and it is inevitable that it will be considered a "savage head" by the unheard-of workers and detained. Its life is in danger! If it comes to Puxi as soon as it arrives, this magnificent "boom boom" sound will surely resonate with the city tiger, and it will not suffer this misfortune. I think the fact is that there have been floods everywhere recently, and the rapids in that stream will surely rush to the river, then rush to the river, and the three rushes will lead to all directions. The big green frog, who is full of travel interest, will also linger and forget to return and ride the long wind and break the ten thousand miles of waves! This big frog sound has not only been heard by the people of Pudong, but also by me, who likes to travel to famous mountains and rivers, and has not heard it anywhere else. Even in Huangshan, it seems that I have never heard it when staying by the stream in his temple.</p>

<h3>Relief Efforts in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>Relief efforts in Suzhou, in these economically depressed times, have seen significant improvements since Zhang Yipeng and Zhu Guanyi took charge of the various organizations under the jurisdiction of the Relief Institute, showing much progress compared to before. The charitable organizations under the Suzhou Relief Institute include five institutions: the Old People's Home, the Reformatory and Vocational Training Center, the Infant Nursery, the Changshan Bureau, and the School for the Deaf and Mute. As for the "Orphanage" outside Changmen, it is run by local people and not under the jurisdiction of the Relief Institute.</p>
<p>The "Old People's Home" is located at Pujiqiao bank of Xiatang Street in Shantang Street, formerly known as "Pujitang," which was specifically for beggars. However, the regulations used to be very lenient, and beggars could come and go freely. The more upright ones would go to the streets every day to peddle licorice medicine cakes and tung oil ash, without being taught any skills. But now, there has been a major reform. Inmates are absolutely not allowed to go out, except those who sell tung oil ash and are allowed to go to the streets for business. The internal facilities, such as clothing, food, and accommodation, have all been improved, and the inmates are also taught to make shoes, knit towels, and other profitable businesses. Compared to the previous "begging Pujitang," it is indeed a world apart.</p>
<p>The Reformatory and Vocational Training Center is located in Baijia Lane, Loumen. The buildings are large and clean. Those being reformed are divided into two categories: self-funded and publicly funded. The self-funded ones have more comfortable food and accommodation. The inmates there must take six classes in rotation from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day, and the rest of the time is for work. The work sections there include rattan work, charcoal base, spinning, and wood machine departments, as well as scripture copying and gardening, a total of six types. Teaching is tailored to the individual, such as letting scholars copy scriptures and farmers till the land, each finding their place. After work, the inmates also have entertainment, such as ping-pong and outdoor sports, to relieve the mental and physical fatigue after a day's work.</p>
<p>Among the charitable organizations under the Relief Institute, the most profitable is undoubtedly the Changshan Bureau, which provides coffin storage. Although the Changshan Bureau also has public coffin storage for a few dollars a year, the ordinary coffin storage rooms, with three coffins in a room, cost 50 yuan per room per year, and a single room costs 70 yuan per year. Furthermore, the Changshan Bureau has so many buildings, so the annual income is considerable. According to the Bureau's report, the surplus in half a year, after deducting expenses, was more than 2,000 yuan. Director Zhang saw that the funeral business could make a lot of money, so he used the three large halls where coffins entered the hall at the Changshan Bureau, whitewashed them, and converted them into funeral parlors. However, this is still a fledgling business, and no one has patronized it yet!</p>
<p>The Infant Nursery, formerly known as the Infant Hall, is located in Zhongyou Jixiang Lane, Loumen. The infants there are, of course, abandoned children. The infants in the nursery are divided into two sections: those fed with human milk and those fed with cow's milk. If someone is willing to take them out for feeding, that is also possible. Each infant is given a subsidy of 6 yuan and 40 cents per month for feeding expenses. The children there all sleep in specially made rattan beds, and their clothing and food are managed using scientific methods, so the infants live much longer than before. If someone adopts the infants as their children, the amount of feeding expenses is determined by age, with a minimum of 4 yuan per infant.</p>
<p>The School for the Deaf and Mute in Song Xianzhou Lane, although established not long ago, has very impressive student achievements. A few days ago, the school held a graduation ceremony, and the three students demonstrated calligraphy and painting to the guests, all of which were excellent. This alone proves that the school's teaching achievements are indeed commendable!</p>
<h3>Xiaoxitian (Little Western Paradise)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: The Curtain Conceals Tearful Traces, Though Escaping Cold Looks; Fine Clothes Flaunt Fortune, Having Been to Powerful Doors</p>
<p>Li Shilian said, "Brother Jie Fu never lies, there's no need to prove it. But I don't know what task Commissioner Lan has here." Zhang Jiefu took the mandarin jacket on the tea table, tucked it under his arm, grabbed his hat, and put it on his head, not caring that it was tilted to one side. He raised his head and walked outside, saying, "Who knows what he's here to do? But according to my ideal, he'll probably be here for ten days or half a month. He's a central commissioner, and if I can get his approval to write a letter to any organization, ha! The hope must be great. Tea boy, open the door and make tea for me." As he spoke, his voice was very high. In fact, the tea boy had already opened the door and made tea. He walked into the room, and Li Shilian followed him in. Smiling, he said, "I was just talking to Mr. Cheng next door, saying that Mr. Zhang's talent is really a head above anyone else. Those who came to Xi'an with him have no news at all, but he is watching a good job come into his hands." Zhang Jiefu raised his head and said with a smile, "I wouldn't dare say I'm talented, luck is what determines everything. If Mr. Lan hadn't come himself, I could say I was confident in finding a way out." Li Shilian said, "I've long wanted to treat you to a pot of wine, I have a lot to talk about. Commissioner Lan is coming tomorrow, I'm afraid you won't have time, can we go out to a small restaurant now and have a good time?" Jie Fu smiled and said, "I wouldn't dare to bother you." Li Shilian laughed and said, "What are you talking about? We're brothers, you bother me once, I bother you once, that's nothing. If you don't honor me, you can call me a bastard." Zhang Jiefu hadn't replied yet, when someone laughed and walked in from outside the door, saying, "Why is Mr. Li admitting to being that thing!" This misunderstanding made Li Shilian unbearably embarrassed. (275)</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original Author Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Now that he's the governor of a province," the Empress Dowager said, "his rank is already very, very high; everyone will naturally respect him, there's absolutely no need for him to put on any airs himself. Especially since he's already a representative of the court, he should always think for the court in everything he does. If he sees these two points, he will definitely treat his people with great leniency! If that old beggar rushed through in front of his ceremonial guard, the most appropriate method would have been to tell his retainers to walk a little slower, let the old beggar pass safely; afterwards, he could still supervise the local officials and yamen runners, instructing them to be careful to clear the way in the future. If he hadn't let his retainers whip the old beggar, nor stopped his ceremonial guard, then the old beggar would have inevitably been trampled to death by the cavalry, which would not have been the best policy. He doesn't even know how to adapt to the situation in such trivial matters, how can he go out and be some high-ranking official?"</p>
<p>The sixth charge, secretly concealing tributes from various regions, can be said to be the most serious. In fact, the people who reported it were not the people of Guangdong, but the provincial officials. Because in the era of autocracy, there was a custom that no matter where one discovered something extremely valuable and of excellent quality;—whether it was a piece of jade of unparalleled purity and clarity, or just a pair of unusually beautiful golden pheasants—the local government would go to great lengths to find it and use it as tribute to the Emperor or Empress Dowager. But their official rank was too low to directly offer it to the imperial court, so all tributes had to be passed on by the provincial governors-general. (375)</p>

<h3>China: Establishment of the Mathematical Society of China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Speeches by Chairman Hu Dunfu, Li Zhaohuan, and Others</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Specially Sends Chen Kezhong to the Meeting to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Meetings to Continue Today and Tomorrow to Discuss Society Affairs</p>
<p>The Mathematical Society of China, organized by professors from various universities in the country, has been prepared and was officially established yesterday at the Jiaotong University Library. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, and the articles of association were discussed in the afternoon. Meetings will continue today and tomorrow to discuss and review issues and terminology. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Over forty members, including Hu Dunfu, Gu Yangwu, Yuan Bingnan, Qiu Weiyu, Chen Huaishu, Shi Faren, and Hu Gangfu from Jiaotong University; Zhu Gongjin from Guanghua University; Ma Mengqiang from Henan University; Xiong Dizi from Tsinghua University; Chen Jinmin and Zheng Jianhan from Jinan University; He Lu from Chongqing University; Zhang Zhenqian from Guangxi University; Gao Yangzhi from Datong University; Chen Jiangong from Zhejiang University; and Dong Xingbei from Wuhan University. Chen Kezhong, representative of the Ministry of Education, and Li Zhaohuan, representative of Jiaotong University, and Yang Xiaoshu, representative of the Science Society of China, attended as advisors.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Hu Dunfu was elected as Chairman, and Yuan Bingnan as Secretary. The Chairman began by reporting that the idea of establishing the Mathematical Society of China had existed for a long time. He recalled that Mr. Zhou Meiquan of the mathematical community had generously donated many mathematical books more than a decade ago and expressed his willingness to donate funds if the Mathematical Society were established. However, due to subsequent changes in the political situation, the idea was shelved. Until last year, Mr. He Lu came to Shanghai from Sichuan and strongly advocated for the organization of the Mathematical Society. The Science Society of China also believed that since various specialized societies had been established one after another, it was necessary to organize a Mathematical Society. Therefore, colleagues were gathered to start preparations, and after several discussions by the preparatory committee, the society was established today. In the future, the work will be divided and cooperated with the Science Society of China to seek progress.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Education: Chen Kezhong, representative of the Ministry of Education, gave instructions, stating that Chinese science can be divided into three major periods: (1) the late Qing dynasty, (2) the early Republic of China, and (3) the last ten years. Scientific knowledge was very superficial in the first period, so there was nothing to talk about. Although there were many people in the second period, they were divided by different schools of thought, which was a period of division. In the third period, not only has the number of people increased dramatically, but everyone is working hard and can unite, which is a good phenomenon. Looking at the establishment of various societies, the astronomical and geological societies were the earliest, followed by physics and chemistry. The botanical and zoological societies were also established last year, and this year comes the Mathematical Society. The Mathematical Society is the mother of all sciences, and it is hoped that colleagues will work harder, surpass those who came before, and become the crown jewel of all sciences.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: Next were speeches by guests: (1) Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, said that mathematics is the oldest science in the world, and this university is also the oldest university in Shanghai. Moreover, this university has always emphasized science and regards it as a fundamental subject. Therefore, he, on behalf of all teachers and students, sincerely welcomes the Society. Mathematics is the mother of all sciences, and the establishment of the Mathematical Society will be of great benefit to the future of science. (2) Yang Xiaoshu of the Science Society of China said that the establishment of various societies in the past two or three years shows the rapid progress of Chinese science. However, thirty or forty years ago, there was no science in China, only the terms Chinese learning and Western learning. Scientific terms only appeared at the end of the Qing dynasty. The Science Society of China was established twenty years ago and can be said to be the earliest scientific research institution. Now, societies for applied science and natural science are springing up, which shows that China now has this talent and this science. The establishment of the Mathematical Society establishes a new force in the academic community, concentrates talent, and will surely add a unique brilliance to the mathematical community. The meeting adjourned at around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Discussion of the Articles of Association: At 12 noon, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, hosted a banquet for all the attending members at the faculty and staff club. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. to discuss the articles of association. Hu Dunfu remained as Chairman, and Yuan Bingnan as Secretary. After a long time, the articles were finally amended and passed, and the meeting ended at around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Continuation of the Meeting Today: The meeting will continue today from 10 a.m. The meeting will discuss society affairs in the morning, elect officers in the afternoon, read papers tomorrow morning, and review the mathematical terms proposed by the Ministry of Education tomorrow afternoon. In the evening, members in Shanghai will host a public banquet for all members. The conference will then conclude.</p>

In this week alone, in just four days, the amount of import surplus that should be settled has been said to be several million, and yesterday, the amount of import surplus settled was as high as more than 1.8 million. In the future, as various orders are shipped in one after another, the leakage [unclear character] will inevitably be even greater. In the market, foreign loans were still opened at two corners in the morning and afternoon, and the drawer was still Bai Liu. The situation was just like in the past. As for the transaction of discount bills, more than 2.4 million was transferred in the morning, more than 300,000 was newly transacted, and more than 300,000 was transacted in the afternoon. More than 600,000 was transacted in the Small General Association. The amount of foreign collateral in and out totaled more than 100,000 in redemptions. The amount made was only 200 to 300,000 in the sale of prosperous goods. Among them, the securities and real estate were mostly old customers transferring accounts. As for new transactions, there were simply none. Regarding the inflow and outflow of banknotes, more than 800,000 was recovered, more than 400,000 in circulating notes was issued, 300 to 400,000 in marked notes, 200,000 from customer sources, and 300,000 was digested.

<p>Yesterday morning, the market price of Jiangnan's small silver dollars [unclear character] had people wanting to buy, but no one was responding to the market. As a result, the market price rose by one yuan, and the transaction volume was very small, estimated at 838 yuan, 1.5 yuan higher than the previous afternoon. The afternoon market still seemed weak, down a small one yuan from the morning market, to 837 yuan, but compared to the previous afternoon, it had already risen again.

<h3>Securities and Bonds: Market Shows Renewed Vigor—Reaching High Prices Not Seen Since the Hebei Incident</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was the last day of futures trading for this month. Because there were only two sessions, both long and short positions were unwinding and closing out positions. Time was running out, and there was no room for maneuver. As rumors in the environment favored the long side, short positions were very [unclear character] to cover, continuing the squeeze, which was quite intense. The long side completely dominated. Number 53 had been consistently buying for [unclear characters] bonds, and the pulling up force was very strong. Number 78 was also very enthusiastic in covering short positions. Others such as Numbers 16, 23, and 47 also mostly absorbed positions. The market price soared, reaching the highest price since the North China Incident. For the trend and future prospects, the big long players are not coming out, and there will be a continuing upward trend. Yesterday, the opening was peaceful, and after entering the market, big players absorbed, gradually showing strength, and suddenly rose by half a yuan. In the second session, the squeeze became more and more urgent. This month's gains were extremely strong, with demobilization rising sharply by one yuan, and gold shorts rising sharply by 1.1 yuan. Number 23's current month once rose to 64.4 yuan, a gain of two yuan compared to the first session. Although such a rapid rise was due to the zero squeeze, it can also be seen that the strength of the long side is very strong. Today and tomorrow, only August futures will be traded for one month. July trading will be held for delivery on the 29th. Yesterday, the market closed with a unanimous rise, ranging from several corners to 1.7 yuan, but the most remote term rose no more than 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 26,655,000 yuan. [Unclear character] The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Italian Bonds Fall</h3>
<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that on [unclear character] (24th), the New York stock market advanced, led by automobile, agricultural [unclear character] and [unclear character] railroad stocks. Speculators were pleased with the market's ability to consolidate its gains. Bond market mixed, Italian bonds declined. Small-cap [unclear character] stocks were firm, utility stocks rose. The total volume traded was 1.31 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>23rd 24th Ups and Downs</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 124.14 124.60 Up 0.46</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn—The Battle for the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Speculators Buy Blindly, Foreign Firms Increase Short Positions</p>
<p>The yarn market is unusually chaotic, and the situation is extremely violent. Both long and short sides have considerable capabilities, but most speculators buy blindly, so the waves are very large. Factories have slightly hedged forward months, but foreign firms not only do not cover their short positions, but also sell additional shorts in forward months. It is said that the banking community is also in a long position. This month is the last day, and business is forming a short squeeze. The closing price was 173 yuan, up 11 yuan from 162 yuan in June. It is heard that the number of deliveries is only 750 bales.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Rise Sharply This Month The opening of the spot yarn market, because the market sentiment was enthusiastic, most said they were bullish. Gengfeng came to buy and add to their positions again, with a sharp increase of 2.8 yuan this month, but the increase in the distant months was weaker, because two yarn factories were hedging in the distant months, and foreign firms were also selling. The second session suddenly fell outside the yuan. By the third session, the long side was still tightening in the current month, and the lifting force was stronger. The distant months were dragged up. At the close, rumors were rife in the market that a certain party was buying again, the market suddenly dried up, and the market suddenly jumped outside one yuan. However, spot yarn trading turned cold due to high prices. It was found that in this upper day, it had gradually risen, and had already risen about 12 yuan. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,500 bales, Daji 1,750 bales, Changji 400 bales, Gu Da 550 bales, Yuan 1 1,500 bales, Yichang 1,500 bales, Changfeng 2,700 bales, Xiecheng 500 bales, Shengyuan 550 bales, Yongda 700 bales. Bought Yida 750 bales, Jinchang 650 bales, Taixing 500 bales, Gengfeng 4,450 bales, Shenchang 1,450 bales, Tongfeng 800 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Runkang 1,400 bales, Dachang 1,200 bales, Xincheng 650 bales, and Deji 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Rises Outside One Yuan Spot yarn sales turned cold. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 600 bales throughout the day, and the market rose outside one yuan. 400 bales of Japanese yarn were transacted. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 100 Mainland 75 Changsha 70 Jiangxi 50</p>
<p>Fujian 10 Counterparts 160 Henan 50 Shantou 10</p>
<p>Xuzhou 15</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Also Has a Struggle</h3>
<p>The cotton market first fell and then rose, but although the situation was cute, the sellers also had a strong resistance, but the cotton yarn market soared, making the long side's intentions firm. This month is the last day of business, and it is heard that there are still more than 11,000 dan for delivery, of which 3,000 are being withdrawn for non-delivery, and the closing peak is 35.5 yuan, up 4.6 yuan from 30.09 yuan in June.</p>
<p>The Long Side Prepares to Take Delivery In the opening of the spot cotton market, there were still more than 10,000 dan for delivery in the current month, and the situation in the market was slightly relaxed and fell. The distant months brought down two or three corners. By the second session, the long side's intentions were firm, and the market turned stable. In the third session, due to the good cotton yarn market, there were more buyers, and there were many rumors that the issue of currency was being raised again, and the market suddenly rose sharply. The distant months jumped up four and a half corners. At the close, the long side was preparing to take delivery and rose, and the distant months also rose with it, but the situation was not as intense as the cotton yarn market. As a result, this month rose by two and a half corners compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the distant month rose by five minutes to two corners. It was found that Jifeng sold 2,000 dan, Yu Da 2,000 dan, Zhenda 1,200 dan, [unclear character] Chang 3,000 dan, Yuan 1 10,800 dan, Yicheng 2,000 dan, Taichang 3,000 dan, Yichang 1,900 dan, Shengyuan 3,600 bundles, Xinheng 3,000 dan, Yuanyuchang 4,300 dan. The Huaitongfu bought 1,200 dan, Suilong 1,600 dan, Hexing 3,600 dan, Gengfeng 3,400 dan, Junchang 1,800 dan, Senkang 1,600 dan, Dachang 2,000 dan, Yongchang</p>
<p>1,700 dan, Tonghe 1,500 dan, Xincheng 4,000 dan, Yifeng 3,300 off, Changhe 3,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Weak Spot cotton consumption is extremely weak, factory demand is not strong, and the source is estimated to be 770 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 41.25 The Yongan Factory purchased 100 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory</p>
<p>Import Statistics of Foreign Cotton The recent import volume of foreign cotton is estimated to be 17,475 pieces of American cotton, 18,285 pieces of Indian cotton, 450 pieces of Egyptian cotton, and 1,300 pieces of Burmese cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Trading Concentrates on Distant Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, because the July period was the last to be settled, each month fell slightly by three to seven pounds. Foreign firms and factories sold distant months, and cotton farmers also hedged. The government sold July, and retail investors moved to distant months. The main reason for foreign firms selling was the Senate's passage of the abolition of export subsidies. In the afternoon, some people covered short positions and made new purchases. New Orleans also engaged in purchases. Peng Kehai's new cotton loan remarks also caused the public to buy. The closing was firm and expensive, with spot prices rising by 15 pounds and futures prices rising by 11 to 17 pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by six points, and futures prices fell by four to six points. Indian cotton was fatigued due to long positions closing and futures traders selling. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 1.25 to 3 rupees, Aomula fell by 2.5 to 5.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (24th telegram).</p>
<p>Pingguoer 142.00 Down 3.00 19.30</p>
<p>December-January 238.25 1.25 18.80</p>
<p>Aomula 104.15 5.75 28.00</p>
<p>December-January 193.50 2.50 26.40</p>
<p>Bailuoxi 219.00 3.50 31.10</p>
<p>April-May 314.75 3.50 19.30</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the April-May Bailuoxi flower on the 25th was 216 rupees, up 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain: Dongxin Japonica Rice Listed Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Shi Arrived...Special Price Eleven Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of Benmi (South Shanghai) was slightly larger, with a total of 17 or 18 arrivals. The market sentiment suddenly turned soft because Dongxin had already been listed. As a result, the prices of each thick japonica and thin indica rice fell back by one or two corners. About 600 to 700 bags of Beiping and Yantai gangs were handled by Baowei. The overcast change [unclear character] did not make a start. As for Dongxin, yesterday, Zhoupu transported 13 shi of rough japonica rice, producing 11 and a half shi of white rice. The rice quality was still clean and white, and the selling price was quite cute because it was the first day of listing in Geng. It was estimated that the price was 11 yuan. As for (North Shanghai), yesterday, the source of each road under the river was 7 or 8. Each white japonica cargo in the market was sluggish and thin, and the price fell back by one or two corners. Thin indica rice arrived sparsely and sold flat, and the price was high. Middle and secondary repairs reduced the price by two corners. Baiyuan Lingchai was silent, and the price was two or three corners, and so on. The prices of other goods were also reduced by about one corner.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice The purchase of goods by the market customer is still alive, especially the Yangtze River all the way is the most lively. The Hankou and Jiujiang gangs have whole tickets for loading, and the industry is also loading themselves. The disaster situation in the Yangtze River is very large, and the demand will be even more prosperous in the future. However, the market hoarders have already sold out with the market after the price has gradually increased. New hoarding is watching, and there is no smooth stomach in the mainland, so the market has fallen by three or four minutes. A total of 8,500 bags of Saigon were opened throughout the day, and 1,000 bags of Siam rice were mostly handled by Jiujiang.</p>
<h3>Powder Manufacturers Gradually Recover This Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market saw a unanimous rise again, because foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose from 45 cents to 70 cents, and Canada rose 20 cents. When the quotation was opened, this month, because the North Gang still had business, and the manufacturers were planning to recover, the situation became more and more tight. As for the distant months, although the manufacturers still had hedging, the outsiders were deeply afraid that if there was a change in the silver issue, the prices would have to be seen higher, so the buying was also very smooth. The trading in half a day has reached more than 400,000 bags, and the mobilization of people's hearts seems to be in progress. It is found that there are few days this month, and it must be delivered. In terms of manufacturers recovering on their own, there is still a good trend. As a result, this month rose by 1.75 points, August and September rose by 1.75 points, October rose by 2 points, November rose by 2.25 points, and December rose by 2 points.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Stable and Slightly Cute</h3>
<p>The futures wheat market has become stable again, and foreign wheat quotations have risen sharply. In recent days, there has been no activity in the hawking of spot foreign wheat. As for domestic wheat, the quotations in the mainland have not been willing to fall, so merchants have not been able to move forward. The stability of the market seems to be promoted by facts. In the future, if there is no dumping of foreign wheat, people's hearts will be more calm. The trading in each session is quite prosperous, and the price is slowly cute, estimated to be 1 point higher this month, and 3 points higher each from August to November. The spot wheat market has turned stable, and the factory stomach is also silent, and there is not much to see delivered. However, the delivery is near, and high goods may have to be sent to the warehouse, so the situation is feeling harmonious. The opening price of wheat was 3.37 yuan for highly capitalized wheat, 3.42 yuan for Shi Pi wheat in Wuhe, 3.4 yuan for Baoying wheat, 3.38 yuan for Yangzhou wheat, a sub-triangle, 3.37 yuan for Lujiabang wheat, 3.35 yuan for Liuhe wheat, 3.37 yuan for Hankou wheat, and 2,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin, and 500 bags were purchased by Xinda.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Still Relies on Shantou Not Helping</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market was slightly more stable compared to the previous market. The reason is that the sharp increase of 3 points on the previous day was not due to real sales, so people's hearts changed immediately. Fortunately, the Shantou gang still asked about the futures cake, so the market price was still similar, but the guest cake had a soft trend. It is estimated that the total market opened with more than 3,600 pieces of spot cakes from each factory, more than 27,000 pieces of futures cakes, and more than 4,000 pieces of guest cakes. Soybeans also made advances and retreats with the cake market, so the market also rose and stabilized. The factory stomach still had inquiries, and the sporadic outlets such as the main street continued to be sold, so the market will temporarily [unclear character] change. It is estimated that nearly 10,000 bags of wheels were opened.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea European Sales Recovered</h3>
<p>Zhenmei is the main commodity in green tea, because it accounts for six or seven tenths of the total amount. The current price is the highest, and its smoothness is very important. Previously, due to unstable exchange rates, Chinese tea merchants asked for prices that were too high, and transactions were slightly dull. Yesterday, each European village in the market, because foreign demand was still high, and the domestic source was not surging, the intention of entering the market turned strong. The whole city was bought by Tianyu Xiehe Hezongtongfu and other companies, including Zhenmei from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, Yushan and other roads, reaching more than 1,200 boxes. The top of the core drawing opened 128 yuan, and the market was still trending hard. Transactions of items such as Zhenmei Gongxi Pearl Tea are also not lonely, but low-grade green tea is still sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Cotton Red Rises Again by One Corner</h3>
<p>Domestic Zhengmian Red, yesterday the market recovered again. The Chao Gang numbers totaled more than 100 bags, and the price was 11.2 yuan, which was another corner higher than the previous day. The trend of the Public Association's plate was stable, and the spot and re-export goods of 24 coarse sand white all called the original price, but did not succeed. The Zhenyu No. 1 brand of cotton white in this factory is still 15.4 yuan, and Numbers 2, 3, and 4 are reduced. Dongbai J logo is 16.45 yuan, and N logo is 16.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The Price of New Golden Daylily Rises</h3>
<p>Since the appearance of the new golden daylily, the land price has sometimes fallen off. Now that sales are still active, the land price is turning hard, and it is not easy to get cheap prices. Yesterday, I heard that it has returned to several corners, and the future market seems to have a hope of continuing to improve.</p>
<h3>Metals: Galvanized Iron Sheet Is Lifeless</h3>
<p>The recent market situation of galvanized iron sheet is very tired, the sale to customers has stopped, and the factory has not moved, so the market situation is sluggish. Although the industry and trade associations are doing their best to promote sales, the flood and bandit disasters are all over the place, and the cash flow in the market is difficult. Due to excessive demand, the market is abnormally weak. Although the standard is that when the foreign exchange has been trending tight in recent days, there is a desire to rise but cannot. The current market valuation is 9.75 yuan for 24 gauges per dan, 10.075 yuan for 26 gauges, and 11.25 yuan for 28 gauges. The thin flower color is 9.45 cents per 37-foot sheet, and 7.56 cents per 36-foot sheet. It is found that transactions in recent days have only been sporadic.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Summer Chat</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>About two months ago, I read a long article by Mr. Gu Shao called "Poetry Talk." Because I disagreed with his understanding of poetry—especially Yuan Zicai's poetry—I once wrote an article in this publication called "Starting from Poetry and Reality." Not long after this article was published, I returned to my hometown due to illness. When I returned to Shanghai, I learned from a friend that Mr. Zhou had published a reply in Qingguang. When I looked at it, the title was "On Poetry Valuing Subtlety," and the issue had been diverted.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou first assumed that I had not carefully read his proposed argument, because he "was discussing poetry talk and did not mention a single word about poetry, but I forcibly dragged him into poetry." But then he said:</p>
<p>"I believe that poetry is conceived in the mind and is not about meticulous textual refinement. Meticulous refinement of words and phrases, like Jia Changjiang's 'three sentences taking two years to achieve, one sigh causing tears to flow,' is enough to hinder the life and progress of poetry. Therefore, new poetry resolutely advocates abandoning tonal patterns and rhyme schemes to break free from the shackles of old poetry; this is the meaning of my short essay."</p>
<p>This can be considered a slap in the face. It turns out that the "short essay" did also mention poetry. However, to be honest, I only knew that Mr. Zhou was vigorously promoting the mind, but I did not see that he also advocated breaking free from constraints. Even now, when I reread that article, I still cannot see it. I am truly "unfortunate."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou borrowed phrases from Suiyuan (Yuan Mei), not only without quotation marks but also with modifications, which shows that he originally intended to present them as his own opinions. But this time, he declared them to be Suiyuan's words again. When expressing personal opinions, there may be some discrepancies, and Suiyuan naturally cannot intervene. But when the person quoting extracts unimportant aspects, it shows that they originally failed to understand it.</p>
<p>The following are my opinions:</p>
<p>I once said: "Only that which does not obscure reality, does not distort reality, and can fully utilize real-world data is good poetry." The sentence before your eyes is about the quality of poetry, not about whether someone is a poet or not. If the "mind" school wants to regard something like "a river is like a standing coffin" as poetry, I can do nothing about it; however, I can say that it is not good poetry.</p>
<p>Du Fu seems to be an exposing poet, but not all of his poems use real-world data; Li Bai, although a drunken fool "indulging beyond physical constraints," also has good poetry that does not obscure reality. This requires deep thought from the reader. If you want to extract good poetry from the Suiyuan Poetry Collection, I think you should first select "Weicao Lament" and many works depicting scenery, because this is precisely his important aspect, and these poems are connected to reality. His poems for a certain Mr. and Mrs. when his "mind" surges are definitely not of high quality. I have said before that Suiyuan's advocacy of the mind is only a tool to oppose traditional thought, and is not comparable to today's mind-reversing homebodies. Hong Liangji said: "Yuan Daling Mei's poetry is like a celestial fox, revealing its tail when drunk." This can be said to be a sound argument.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention the main point of Mr. Zhou's proposed argument this time. I have never advocated any "straight" literature, and I don't even know what "curved" and "straight" are. If that refers to the hidden and obvious in the method of performance, the direct narrative and the side writing, then it is entirely a question of the method of performance, and has nothing to do with reality, mind, and so on. The method of expression can vary from person to person, from matter to matter, and from place to place. Essays do not necessarily value straightness, and poems do not necessarily value subtlety. Essays with indirect narratives and poems with direct narratives can still be good essays and good poems.</p>
<p>The "good" that I am talking about here refers to the poetry and prose itself and its effect. Poetry and prose that like to tell jokes and interfere in other people's business may not be good in my opinion. I believe that the meaning of the word "good" is not so elusive.</p>
<p>These are all just idle talk, used to beat the summer heat. If I can only be considered a writer because of this, then I don't need to seek the admiration of others.</p>
<h3>A Pair</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>A misty rain. The night is already very late. There are no pedestrians on the road. A patrolman suddenly appeared from the corner of the road.</p>
<p>His upright body was wrapped in a new blue uniform, so blue that it shimmered under the streetlights. The leather shoes made a strange noise. His eyes followed the sound of the leather shoes, gliding along very smartly.</p>
<p>He was getting closer and closer, and his eyes had already slid over to the young man in a suit standing on the curb. In the dark, gloomy night air, the man was flicking the ash off his blood-red cigarette with his finger.</p>
<p>He walked towards the young man in the suit. Before he had carefully sized up the other person's appearance, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"You…"</p>
<p>"No," the young man in the suit took a hard puff of his cigarette, then slowly continued while rotating the bright ring on his ring finger with his thumb, "Please don't suspect me. I am waiting here for a friend from ten years ago."</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, my friend and I often came here for tea (he pointed behind him with his thumb). It used to be called Longxing Teahouse, but now it has been changed to a half-teahouse, half-snack shop. I saw it during the day."</p>
<p>"My friend and I were together all day long, talking about how to make a living, how to avoid starving."</p>
<p>"But we were always hungry, so we either sat in teahouses all day or wandered the streets. Yes, we would never be alone anywhere. Because we were poor, we were lonely, and we needed comfort and support even more. So, when other friends saw me, they always called us 'a pair!' 'Here comes that pair again.'" He laughed, and a few gold teeth flashed.</p>
<p>He took another hard drag on the cigarette butt, threw it on the ground, wiped his mouth, and continued:</p>
<p>"You don't have anything to do, do you? Then let's talk for a while. Once, ten years ago today, I had no way to survive in this city, so I decided to go to the docks and try my luck."</p>
<p>"It was also him who helped me plan a little travel money, although he strongly opposed me leaving him. That night, we also drank there (he looked at the shop across the street, which was separated by a light rain). That wine shop is probably closed now. We drank until the wine shop closed, which was half past two in the morning, I remember very clearly (he stretched out his left hand and looked at the watch on his wrist). We made a pact at the time, to meet here again on this day ten years later, no matter how difficult it was, we had to find a way to meet. Right now (he looked at his watch again) it's one twenty-five. He hasn't come yet. I guess, as long as he's still alive, he'll come. When he sees that I'm still alive, he'll surely exclaim, 'You, you're not dead yet!' Yes, as long as he's still alive, he'll definitely come."</p>
<p>"So, where have you been these past ten years?"</p>
<p>"Places? I've been all over the place, quite a few places if you count them up. Tianjin, Jilin, Beijing, ×××, almost everywhere."</p>
<p>"What kind of business have you been doing in these places?"</p>
<p>"A lot. Tea business, restaurants, and recently even a mining business." He stretched out his left hand again, revealing the shiny watch, and it was almost one forty.</p>
<p>"So, you're very successful now?" The patrolman asked flatly, and without waiting for a reply, walked away.</p>
<p>"Yes," the young man in the suit replied casually. He sent the patrolman away with a proud look, and the patrolman disappeared at a corner.</p>
<p>A moment later, a figure came running from the corner where the patrolman had turned. He was also wearing a suit, with a yellow raincoat over it. As he ran, he shouted loudly to the young man in the suit standing on the curb:</p>
<p>"Lao Hui! Lao Hui!"</p>
<p>The man called Lao Hui also waved his arms wildly to greet him. They met and naturally shook hands tightly.</p>
<p>"Lao Hui, you're not dead yet!"</p>
<p>"And you? You're not dead either! Hahaha!"</p>
<p>"Let's go!" He tugged at Lao Hui's sleeve, then pinched the material of the sleeve and laughed, "Pig! You must be on a lucky streak, wearing such fine clothes."</p>
<p>"Hahaha! They're very cheap! What about you? Your clothes aren't bad either!"</p>
<p>They walked and laughed. Two long shadows swayed in the night rain behind them.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go?" Lao Hui asked.</p>
<p>"I've already prepared a car, just a few more steps, at that corner, I told him to wait. Tonight, I'm definitely going to take you to play with some girls!"</p>
<p>"Lao Jiu! No!" Lao Hui suddenly shouted, "You're not Lao Jiu! How can the tone of your voice have changed so much? You don't have any of the accent of our hometown! You're not Lao Jiu! You definitely aren't Lao Jiu!"</p>
<p>"What? The tone of my voice? Yes, my tone of voice has changed, that's because the friends I hang out with now are all from other places."</p>
<p>"No! No! You're definitely not Lao Jiu! Lao Jiu wouldn't call them 'flowers,' he would call them 'bean curd meat.'"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll talk to you in detail in the car! You'll understand in just five minutes."</p>
<p>They got into the car. Vroom! It drove off. In the quiet sound of the rain and the turning wheels of the car, the young man in the raincoat turned on the electric light with his finger and showed Lao Hui this note:</p>
<p>"Lao Hui: I was just about to say 'You, you're not dead yet!' but as soon as your cigarette lit up, I immediately recognized that you were the person I wanted to kill. The person I wanted to find was just like you. However, as soon as you said we were 'a pair!' I didn't dare to do it myself, so I called this brother to come. However, you may immediately not be okay. Please forgive me, I believe, we are still 'a pair!' Lao Jiu."</p>
<h3>Two Female Types (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Qi Wuwen</p>
<p>When the car started, it was drizzling, but the rain gradually increased, and the carriage was full of coolness. The conversational skills of the passengers seemed to have gradually dulled, and some had already leaned against their chairs to doze off. This female companion also closed her eyes pretending to sleep, but when the car stopped at the intermediate station, she always opened her eyes and asked me what place it was.</p>
<p>The car finally passed the new station. Most of the passengers were busy packing their luggage and putting on thicker clothes. This female companion also put on her raincoat again and added a scarf. I was still sitting still.</p>
<p>"Put on a piece of clothing! It's very cold outside," she kindly said to me.</p>
<p>"It's okay," I said.</p>
<p>"Put on a piece of clothing." This time she seemed to be ordering me.</p>
<p>"I don't feel cold." I didn't say that I didn't bring any thick clothes, I only thanked her for her kindness in my heart.</p>
<p>After getting off the car, I met the friend who came to pick me up. The three of us left the station together. I glanced at the partner sent by the ×× Hotel to pick up the car. I pointed it out to her, said goodbye, and followed my friend into the car that picked up guests from another hotel.</p>
<p>I've been to Tianjin no less than ten times, but I've never stayed there for more than three days. The first time I stayed in Tianjin for two days, I was sick for two days. I don't like Tianjin, which may be one reason. Speaking of Tianjin, it's not bad. The neat and clean streets and buildings, the modern equipment are like other big cities, and it's not as chaotic and noisy as Shanghai. However, precisely because of this, this northern metropolis is too ordinary. It lacks stimulation and appeal for tourists.</p>
<p>The reason I came to Tianjin this time was to see a classmate I hadn't seen for a long time. Another friend said that this friend was too "foreign" to the core. As soon as the car stopped, I saw him standing on the platform. His attire had added a bit of a gentlemanly air: he was wearing a coat with a swan collar, a cane was hanging on his arm, and he was holding a pair of gloves in his left hand.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the hotel, after talking about the situation since we had parted, he told me with a smile. .</p>
<p>"Josephine sent a letter recently, saying that she is engaged and will be married soon."</p>
<p>Josephine was his lover in France. They originally had an "engagement agreement", but after he returned to China, he knew that it was impossible to bring her to China, and he was currently weaving a Chinese lady. However, Josephine treated him too well, and as long as Josephine still loved him, he always felt a little burdened in his soul.</p>
<p>"Your burden can be lifted," I said.</p>
<p>"What kind of gift should I give her?" He smiled and then asked. His thoughtful gentlemanly manner towards women was revealed again.</p>
<p>He originally knew two women in Tianjin at the same time: one was a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old female student, and the other was a lady from a noble family. When he was hesitating between "bear's paw and fish", he also wrote to me asking me to make a decision for him. I returned him a letter of "refusal." Later, when he decided to take the lady from the noble family as his target of pursuit, I poured a bucket of cold water on him, but he was not angry.</p>
<p>"How are you doing with Miss Zhang?"</p>
<p>"There is no big problem," he replied triumphantly, "Miss Zhang is very understanding of me. The problem is her father, he wants me to find a job before he agrees to our engagement. Do you want to meet her?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>University Days (31)</h3>
<p>— By the German Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>After a while, I stood up and walked into the hall. This hall was darker than I had imagined; the trees near the windows seemed to have branches growing to the roof. I tapped on the table with my cane, causing echoes in the tall ceiling; but no one came.—In a small room on the left I saw a lonely billiard table standing. But there was another door at the bottom of the hall on the other side; I opened the door, walked into a narrow passage, and through this passage I came to an open space again.—Near the house, next to a sports field, I found a middle-aged man with a green apron around his waist sleeping on the grass. In fact, this was the servant Ou!—When I touched him with my cane, he opened his eyes and jumped up. "I'm sorry, sir!" he said, "I was very busy last night and didn't sleep well."</p>
<p>I looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>"Don't you know?" he continued, looking at me, from head to toe. "The university gentlemen have moved their club here since Easter."</p>
<p>I really didn't know, although most of my friends had joined this club.</p>
<p>I ordered a bottle of beer and a piece of bread, and we went back into the hall.—When the sunlight shone in through the open door, I saw many black spots in the center of the floor, and then I knew without a doubt: not only the club, but the fencing field attached to the club, had also moved to this quiet place.—"Why don't you wipe off these blood stains?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, sir!" replied the pale-faced servant Ou, "But the blood stains reappear after they are wiped off. This is what was left behind by that unfortunate incident.—When that enthusiastic young gentleman died so quietly and so pale, the situation was very tragic."</p>
<p>I immediately remembered the incident, where the widow left behind by a poor officer lost her only son in this incident. This happened not long after I returned home, and the incident aroused the sympathy of all the people in this small place.</p>
<p>I walked out of the hall and sat on a green bench, thinking about this poor, passionate young man; his life left a final unpleasant mark here.</p>
<p>After a while, the servant Ou brought me the breakfast I had ordered. "Tonight, you'll have good things to see," he said, putting the cups and plates on the table in front of me; "We have a dance party here, the boss has to send all the cooks from his house here."</p>
<h3>"American-Style Pure Objectivism"</h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>Among many literary researchers, there are so-called "American-style pure objectivists". These gentlemen can not only write articles on literary theory and literary history, but also write large books studying literature, but when they write articles or books, they only "objectively" list the names of many writers, their works and their birth and death dates, and only "objectively" list the opinions of many famous literary researchers in history, without adding their own explanations or judgments. For example, when they are writing a book called "Introduction to Literature", they list the opinions of Juyou, Taine, Wilde, Tolstoy, Plekhanov, etc. in each chapter and section, without making any judgments about right and wrong, good and bad, leaving everything to "objective evaluation". Therefore, when you read such an "objective" "Introduction to Literature", you only see it written line by line: "Taine said…; Tolstoy said…", as for what literature is and how many problems in literature can be solved, no clear answers can be found in such works.</p>
<p>Such a literary theory work without judgment seems to be very "objective" on the surface. But in fact, it still contains the author's most important "subjective" views. The "American-style pure objectivist"'s consistent attitude of writing articles and compiling books in a "purely objective" manner is a manifestation of his consistent "subjective" views; moreover, in his "purely objective" narrative, he often intentionally or unintentionally expresses his "subjective dogmatism". For example, Hisama Kumawo's "A Theory of European Modern Literary Trends", which specializes in listing people's names and book titles, and his "Introduction to Literature", which piles up the opinions of various schools, are said to be very "objective" works, but on closer inspection, the author's humanistic "subjective" views still play a dominant role in Hisama Kumawo's two books.</p>
<p>Because of this, there are many conflicting opinions in such literary works. (For example, Taine and Wilde, Tolstoy and Plekhanov, their respective literary opinions are conflicting.) Now, the "American-style pure objectivist" piles up these conflicting opinions together without judgment to form a book. This not only shows their lack of the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but also results in the mixing of truth and falsehood, confusing the eyes of ordinary readers, so that they cannot recognize right and wrong. If such a "purely objective" book-writing method has been "subjectively" approved by the author, then the result is that truth and falsehood coexist, and right and wrong cannot be distinguished. Here we can't help but exclaim: the so-called "American-style pure objectivism" is really "yellow silk, young woman, grandson carrying mortar" (exquisite words)! We can only dare not praise it!</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Dilemma: Victory and Defeat Are Both Difficult</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The Italian-Abyssinian (Ethiopian) issue has now entered a critical stage. With both sides taking extreme positions and mediation by Britain, France, and other countries proving ineffective, there are rumors of a major war breaking out within a week. The seriousness of the situation cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Among the mediators, Britain is the most active. This is because Britain possesses a rich colony in Africa, and other countries also have considerable interests in Abyssinia. In the event that Italy conquers Abyssinia, a conflict of interest would be unavoidable. If Italy fails, there is also the danger of unrest in British territories. Therefore, Britain is the most vehemently opposed to the Italian-Abyssinian War.</p>
<p>Previously, the British cabinet met to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian issue. It is said that they have decided to adopt a policy of complete harmony with the League of Nations Covenant. The British government will likely instruct Sir Drummond, the British ambassador to Italy, to explain two points to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini: (1) If Italy wins, the suppressed anger of people of color will worsen the situation. (2) If Italy fails, the victory of black people over white people will cause open rebellion among the nationalities of various colonies. Therefore, regardless of the outcome, Britain is deeply worried.</p>
<p>This explanation by Britain has been direct and honest, truly reflecting the real situation. However, this statement is made from the perspective of Britain. Hypothetically, from Italy's perspective, assuming Italy wins, the other countries will be jealous due to conflicts of interest. In the event that Italy fails, the defeat of white people by black people would be intolerable.</p>
<p>However, Mussolini has now reached a point of no return. Having already unfurled the sails and mustered the courage, how can he retract now? Furthermore, Mussolini has three main objectives in this campaign against Abyssinia: (1) Italy suffered a loss of face in Abyssinia in the past, and now seeks to restore its honor. (2) Mussolini has trained hundreds of thousands of troops in recent years, and this provides an opportunity to showcase their strength. (3) After the European War, Italy did not receive the benefits of German territories, and this provides an opportunity to settle old scores.</p>
<p>However, considering the outcome of Italy's campaign against Abyssinia, victory and defeat are both difficult. Failure would not only wipe away a lifetime of reputation, but also lead to incalculable losses for Italy and changes in the international landscape. Even with victory, the aftermath may be even more complicated.</p>
<h3>Pure Pleasures in the Dust #2</h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>Many people think that living in the city means being deprived of any sense of pure pleasure. In fact, this is incorrect. In the previous article, I briefly wrote about some pure pleasures of living at home in the city. Now I would like to write about some pure pleasures outside of the home in the city.</p>
<p>Skyscrapers have become the symbol and backbone of modern cities. Many people, upon seeing these concrete and steel structures, deeply despise the "scholar hermits" of Lin Yutang and his ilk. In fact, they completely fail to understand what constitutes true interest.</p>
<p>Let's not even discuss the forms and lines of those skyscrapers, or their value in modern aesthetics. Simply imagine climbing to the very top at sunset and watching the clamorous disturbances of the city below, merging into a blurred scene, with countless wisps of cooking smoke weaving a misty twilight. The setting sun, obscured by smoke, is no longer blinding but allows one to see its complete, rounded form as it slowly sinks between several other skyscrapers. At this moment, as you look around at the vastness, a myriad of emotions rise within you: "Before me, I see no ancient sages; behind me, no successors appear. I think of the immensity of Heaven and Earth, and I weep, alone and overwhelmed."</p>
<p>Just as you are lost in deep thought, the colorful neon lights of the street awaken you, immediately drawing you into another realm. I don't know where the hazy and faint light of twilight has gone. What appears before you now is brightness and warmth, beauty and purity. Looking down, the cars on the street flow past like a river. The Later Lord Li's words, "Carriages flow like water, horses like dragons," become a reality. If it's the time of the full moon, because you are standing so high, no matter how bright the city lights may be, you can always see the moon by looking up. If your eyesight is good, you may even catch a glimpse of a few graceful stars twinkling at you. At this moment, your previous feeling of vast sorrow will surely deepen: "I want to ride the wind and fly home, yet I fear the jade towers and jeweled mansions are too cold up high." A gust of wind brings a slight chill, and you awaken as from a dream, realizing how high you are standing.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are strong, you can endure for a while longer; if you are weak, you cannot stay for even a moment.</p>
<p>Walking down from the skyscraper, it's already late at night. At that time, do not walk down the main street. Instead, find a few deserted streets to stroll along. It is best if you can find a street that is not paved with bright asphalt, and allow a gust of wind to stir up the dust and sand on the road, blowing it into your face as you look up. Stagger along, walking in solitude. The shops on the deserted street are already closed, except for the small pubs that stay open all night. If you have a few coins in your pocket, you might as well go up and have a few sips. The seat should naturally be by the window, and there need not be many people. Sip slowly, one mouthful at a time, and look out the window. The dim streetlights shine weakly. If heaven smiles and a light rain suddenly falls, that would be even more wonderful. As Lu You wrote in his poem, "Sparse lamps, a light rain, and maple trees by the pub." Only those who truly understand taste can appreciate this sorrowful interest.</p>
<p>Naturally, by this time, your sorrow has become like a fine wine aged for several years—faint yet potent. If that is still not enough, you might as well sit for a while longer. In less than an hour, a blind person, led by a child, will surely pass by beneath the pub, playing a desolate sanxian lute. At that moment, no matter how strong you are, you will certainly be defeated by sorrow. So you give some money, come down from the pub, and stroll home, pouring yourself a cup of strong tea until dawn, as you certainly won't be able to sleep tonight.</p>
<p>What I have described above is the true taste of the city. Although this taste is indeed sorrowful, its aftertaste will never bore you or make you shallow, unlike the pleasures of a decadent and materialistic life.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>The morning after I received the news of my uncle's serious illness, the sky was fluttering with light rain. In my experience, the weather seems to be predetermined, and there is never a sunny day. In the cramped room, I turned on the light and had my breakfast. A watch seemed to be suffering from indigestion. After more than ten years of being together, it deliberately neglected its responsibility today; it couldn't run at four o'clock. But it certainly isn't that early now. I opened the small square window. The gloomy sky looked like a mourning face. My sharp observation couldn't tell what time it was. I had never gone to the station so early to wait for the train. Today I have to start that new experience. When I got on the streetcar, I thought about the annoying policeman who could comfortably inspect my luggage today. My uncle was sick, and I had visited the countryside three times, and each time I was disturbed by that annoying guy and almost got off the train. When that boring thought came to my mind, I deliberately messed up the luggage that I had organized in the car, and it was simply impossible to tell a shirt from a pair of socks. At the same time, I was sizing up that pair of rats who couldn't get any oil or water, using their sharp noses to try to find something they needed. That situation was quite enough to pass the time. When they put that pile of messy things back into the luggage, their faces must have turned red, like a ripe watermelon, or maybe they would scold "bastard" - that sound must not be as startling as being summoned to the manager's office for doing something wrong, they must lower their voice so low that I might not be able to hear it, just like a dumb person eating chili peppers.</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of the station gate. I first glanced at the platform from the car shed, and that annoying guy was indeed one of the three. But he looked even more energetic today, and the bulky body was covered with a raincoat, as if he were an important person seen in the newspaper. He was using his sharp eyes, like a searchlight, to shine from this side to that side. When I paid the fare, he lingered and was a leader. The horseshoe nails on the heels of his leather shoes rolled down the stone steps like hitting the keys of a piano, and in the</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In the humid air, the sound was so loud that I didn't dare let my dry eyelids, which hadn't slept all night, droop down listlessly again. At the same time, I took a deep breath into my lungs and straightened my chest, trying to look a little braver. But when I stood next to him, I was almost a head shorter than him. He opened my luggage on the stone steps as if he were picking up a chick. I looked at the wind so that the ruthless rain would not blow over and wet my luggage, and took out a cigarette from my pocket and lit it. At that time, I also thought about giving him one as a reward for taking care of my luggage for the fourth time, but I didn't have the courage, and I was afraid that he would suspect that my cigarette was mixed with narcotics, which would be difficult to explain.</p>
<p>The clock tower at the station struck eight, and there were eight minutes left before the train left, so I thought of the sick watch, and with the air of a doctor, I asked it to run for four hours, and then I put it to my ear to listen to it start working before I felt relieved. I was watching the clock tower, as if I were a lover waiting for an appointment, hoping that these eight minutes would pass quickly. I really felt too embarrassed by the many porters' eyes on me.</p>
<p>In the last two minutes, the passengers getting on the train crowded in. They jumped to avoid the raindrops falling from above, and were afraid that they would not be able to buy tickets in the two minutes. Everyone seemed so panicked. The guy had just given up on my luggage and wanted to search for a reliable person to make up for his wasted efforts. But I was also preparing to get on the train. In two minutes, it was enough time for me to buy a ticket, get on the train and find a seat, and I had to catch my trip.</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang Suhe's Talented Student</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenyi's Work (Only Fourteen Years Old)</p>
<h3>Walking in the Rain</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>With a bewildered heart, I stepped wearily onto the streets at dawn. The morning breeze gently brushed against me, while the drizzle fell softly in the sky. The streets were as quiet as death!</p>
<p>At the pier, I stood proudly among many children, looking at the suitcase lying quietly beside me, feeling a little lost in my heart:</p>
<p>—Children, my sudden departure this time can be said to be an accident; but I will be back soon!</p>
<p>At this time, there was no hypocrisy, no disgust around me, only innocent eyes and innocent laughter; but I would be separated from these little angels immediately after this moment. I felt a little lost, I felt a little sad! However, when I thought about going to pursue my own glorious future, an idea of excitement came to my mind.</p>
<p>—Mr., when will you come back? We will be looking forward to your return every night!</p>
<p>Ying'er's words struck my heart like an alarm bell, making me hesitate to answer.</p>
<p>—Ah! You wait! Probably not in the season when lychee flowers bloom.</p>
<p>I endured the hot tears and reluctantly replied with such a sentence. But will I really come back when the lychee flowers bloom? If I can't come back by then, how will they look forward to it! If they hope that I won't come back, how will they be disappointed! Ah! I deceived these innocent children.</p>
<p>—It's still more than half a year before the lychee flowers bloom; the days are so long! Mr., can't you come back sooner?</p>
<p>Ming'er was about to cry: He held the corner of my clothes with his small hands, as if afraid that I would spread my wings and fly away. I stroked his soft hair with my hand, lowered my head, and gently kissed him on the forehead, kissing him.</p>
<p>—Mr., when you come back, you must bring more good stories.</p>
<p>Xiao Qian was still jumping in front of me so lively, asking me to bring some stories; I nodded to her absently.</p>
<p>I really wanted to cry at this time, but I didn't dare to cry in front of this group of children; seeing more than a dozen pairs of small eyes staring at my face, I no longer had the courage to look at them; I was ashamed, I was in pain, I had many words to tell them, but every time I just spit it out to my mouth, it slipped back. I was silent, and they were silent. Between us, only the boundless silence reigned.</p>
<p>The drizzle was still falling endlessly. Many workers on the wharf were busy carrying goods and luggage. The passengers who came to take the boat also slowly crowded up. I looked at the watch on my wrist and knew that the time for departure was not far away; so I reluctantly comforted them and said:</p>
<p>—Come back, I must come back: At least I have to come back to see you often. Now it's raining heavily, you should go home quickly!</p>
<p>But they didn't leave, they still surrounded me foolishly, and in each pair of small eyes, they were full of enthusiastic and sincere tears.</p>
<p>The whistle roared three times, and I subconsciously picked up the suitcase and fled into the cabin like a fugitive, and fell on my bunk and cried. At this time, I cried as much as I wanted, cried freely, and released all the depression that had been accumulating for more than an hour, and I didn't care about the surprised stewards and passengers on the ship. I didn't even think about whether this group of children had gone back?</p>
<p>The whistle sounded again, and the ship moved slowly. I woke up from the bunk, wiped away my tears, and looked out from the round window, and saw that this group of innocent children were still standing foolishly on the pier, looking at the ship, so I ran to the deck in one breath, stood by the railing, took out a handkerchief from my pocket, and waved it to them, waving it, they also raised a small arm each and waved it to me, I waved the handkerchief to them, but a pile of unnatural wry smiles floated on my face!</p>
<p>The speed of the ship increased, and the shadows of this group of people quickly disappeared in my eyes. Before long, even the roof peaks of the pier could not be seen.</p>
<p>I staggered down the escalator step by step, walked back to the cabin, lay on my own bunk, and felt very tired. I wanted to rest quietly; but curled up in the corner of the bunk, as soon as I closed my eyes, those dozen pairs of small eyes and dozen small faces flashed clearly in front of me—sometimes it seemed like I was teaching them gymnastics in the garden, and sometimes it seemed like I was teaching them in the classroom. I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to sleep, I jumped up from the bunk irritably, but I fell down again without realizing a dizziness. I buried my head in the quilt, trying to calm my nerves, but I felt the ship shaking very badly. I sat up, pushed open the window and looked outside, and realized that the ship was already sailing on the sea.</p>
<p>The rain seemed denser than in the morning, and the sea surface seemed to be covered with a thick fog. The surroundings were blurred, and no trace of smoke waves could be seen in the distance. Only the sound of rain was noisy on the ship, and the roaring sound of the waves was composed into a symphony of the sea.</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<p>Since its organization, the Zacao Art Friends Society has received the support of comrades from all parties to join and cooperate, so the society's affairs are exceptionally solid. The harmonica and drama groups have stopped broadcasting for a month, which has caused inquiries from all walks of life. Now, the society has resolved through its eighth general meeting to move all society affairs and correspondence matters to No. 27 Huaxing Lane, Xicangqiao Street, Shanghai. In addition, the society's published "Zacao Literature and Art" weekly will continue to be edited by Xia Zhonghan and Wu Xiongjian.</p>
<p>Miss Yang Zengshu of the Rose Troupe went to Beijing for troupe affairs and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. In addition to the normal broadcast, she will continue to print the fourth issue of the Guanghua Collection to give to the audience. The saying that some tabloid said she had left is completely untrue. Because Mr. Yang is the founder and leader of the Rose Troupe, and the female members have been able to achieve today's results because they were all taught by Mr. Yang alone, so in fact there is absolutely no possibility of leaving. Moreover, the Rose Troupe is currently preparing several new songs and musical dramas, which will be broadcast soon. There are fears that there will not be enough female members to allocate, so it is planned to add several members from Ping or who can speak Mandarin. Anyone with considerable achievements can sign up. Correspondence address: Zhou Gong, 145 Chibang Road.</p>

<h3>Linhua Snippets</h3>
<p>Wang Cilong's new work was originally planned to be Liang Desuo's "Dayu Ridge," but due to various reasons, it is temporarily postponed. It has now been decided to adopt an ethical and social drama written by Jin Qingyu, with the film title yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work will be sent to Beijing for review soon. It is a children's educational film, with the title yet to be determined, but it is not based on an adaptation of "Watch."</p>
<p>"Family" only has one more location scene left before it is completed. This film writes about four generations of the same family living together, running through decades of stories. The whole play is full of family love, but it is definitely not promoting a narrow family concept.</p>
<p>Since the film "Family" has been completed, Chen Yanyan has been focusing on the work of "Wild Geese Falling on the Cold River." This film was specially written for Yanyan by Ma Xu Weibang, and it is expected that Yanyan will make a special contribution.</p>
<p>Since starring in "Carefree Gentleman," Mei Lin has received enthusiastic attention from the audience. Mei Lin also plays an important role in "Family."</p>
<p>"Family" is a collaboration between twelve Linhua stars, and each actor has an equal opportunity for development.</p>
<p>When Wang Cilong's new work begins filming, he will lead the photography team to Nankou to take scenes. Sun Yu and Wu Yonggang's new works will take scenes in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Xi Zhihua plays Chen Yanyan's younger aunt in "Wild Geese Falling on the Cold River," talkative and vivid, almost making Yanyan angry to death.</p>
<p>"Four Sisters" and "Wild Geese Falling on the Cold River" are both working very hard, and "Family" and other three films will be released one after another following "Little Angel."</p>
<h3>Famous Young Composer Nie Er Dies in Sea Bath in Japan</h3>
<p>Famous young composer Mr. Nie Er went to Japan this spring to prepare for a short-term inspection and then went to Europe to study music. He asked a friend to get his last letter, which said that he would go to Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe on July 17 to participate in the Japanese "New Association" tour performance. Unexpectedly, according to another friend's report, he died after being swept away by a wave while swimming in the sea in Fujizawa Town, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan on the 17th. His body was missing. The colleagues of the Telecommunications Universal News Agency will publish the following notice in its sixth issue of the pictorial, "Young composer Mr. Nie Er died on July 17 while swimming in the sea in Kugenuma, Fujizawa Town, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Most of the colleagues of this newspaper have known Mr. Nie Er, and the bad news has caused great grief. It is planned to open a special column in the seventh issue of this newspaper to commemorate the author of this epoch-making Chinese film music. There are many friends of Mr. Nie Er in all parties. If you are willing to offer condemnations, it will not only mourn the untimely death of a genius, but also promote the quiet light of the spring. Please send your pieces to the editorial office at No. 405 Jingzhou Road before August 10." It is said that the former friends of Nie Er are now preparing a memorial service for him, and are collecting his posthumous works to hold a performance to mourn him. His works, such as Graduation Song, Pioneer of the Road, Great Road Song, New Woman Song, Flying Flower Song, Song of the Singing Girl Under the Iron Heel, March of the Volunteers, are mostly popular and do not need to be introduced. This is indeed a major misfortune for the Chinese film music industry.</p>
<h3>Nie Er's Remains</h3>
<h3>Public Screening of "The Secret of the Dog Racing Track"</h3>
<p>"The Secret of the Dog Racing Track" is a new and unique product from the British Gaumont-British company. Dog racing originated in England, so a film produced by an English company and capturing the local scenery of England will naturally be of excellent quality. The dogs participating in the race in the film can be said to be a grand spectacle of the nation, especially since Mick The Miller, famous throughout Europe, displays his skills and performs various acts here. (Mick is a famous animal with documented records and is a highly revered idol in the English dog racing scene; his parents are both of excellent breeding stock). Collaborating actors include comedic stars Sonny Hale, Wynes Lloyd, etc. This film is not only recommended by art and entertainment enthusiasts but is also a masterpiece that dog racing fans cannot miss. It is currently being screened in "Nanjing."</p>
<h3>Recent News from Yanguang</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Yanguang Film and Drama Society has been employing domestic researchers in dramatic arts for guidance, specializing in the study of spoken drama. Recently, they are planning to stage the five-act comedy "She Stoops to Conquer" by Oliver Goldsmith. It is said that they are still lacking several male and female actors. Any male or female comrades with proper cultivation in drama are welcome to apply to participate. The society's address is temporarily located in the French Concession, at the end of Nanking Road, Rong Sheng Li.</p>
