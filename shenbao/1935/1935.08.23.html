<p>時評</p>
<h3>今日之金融問題</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>市面之演進。往往由發展。而膨脹而恐慌。而緊縮。而呆滯。而改進。而重歸於發達。所謂剝極則復。否極則泰。盈虛消息之由來。蓋亦自然循環之理也。上海銀錢兩業。相繼發生事故。近則驚風駭浪。逐漸消除。其不能立足者歸于自然淘汰。幸而得存者則審愼小心。非常緊縮。九底帳期。自無問題之可有。至停業各銀行之淸理。除美銀行外。雖尙少顯著之成績。但政府對於銀錢業之監督。確已着着進行。發鈔銀行。名義上猶各自為政。實際上如欲集中統一。亦反掌間事。昔日官辦銀行。往往招致商股以厚信用。今則商辦銀行。如中國實業。中國通商。四明等。聞均將加入官股矣。各種儲蓄會亦有收歸中央信托局辦理之說矣。發鈔統一。事業集中。進而謀幣制之整理。全國金融事業之調整。數年之後。可　踏上軌道。邁步前進矣。　幣制改革之際。頭緒至為紛繁。廢兩改元。行已多年。求之內地。猶難盡革。川省幣制。凌亂不堪。但無川省之甚而尙不統一者。又比比皆是。　如整理江浙一帶之幣制。其事易。蓋本相統一出。整理全國之貨幣。其事難。蓋紛然雜陳也。然欲整理。亦不能舍難就易。必待全部能改革。而後其效始見。一不明整理幣制者。常作杞人之憂。不知幣制之整理。應有之舉也。統一之國家。應有統一之幣制。至於貨幣能否發揮其效用。質之臨係。固甚重要。然其關鍵仍在乎發行是否有健全之組織。維持是否有堅固之信用。淸末鑄造銅幣。何嘗不規定銅圓百枚換銀圓一枚。而今可兌三百四十　枚者。因不能維持其信用。始照幣質之含量而定其價値員。故幣制無論如何改革。信用為第一。辦理而不得其宜。豈僅為叢敺爵而已哉。</p>
<p>我金融業决定其努力方針之時機。今已至矣。美國銀派議員。似漸有所覺悟。派遣代表。分赴歐亞南美二洲調査白銀狀况。冀於將來成立白銀新法。紐約銀市塲並有恢復之說。是則美國之銀政策。終必有所變更。目前當亦不致採取任何積極之行動。吾人果能不為一時利害所囿。而利用時機。乘英美代表先後蒞臨之際。從整個民族經濟着想。痛下一番功夫。樹立百年大計。則今日之多艱多難。正足以淬厲我金融業之復興精神矣。</p>

<h3>英閣議五小時　討論大局完畢　閣員二十二人全體出席面容嚴肅羣衆亦無歡聲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨十時唐寗街相邸開始舉行內閣緊急會議、攷慮阿比西尼亞問題、有大批警察在道中彈壓羣衆、掌璽大臣麥唐納最先至、應大隊攝影員之請、立於相邸階上、供衆攝影、繼乃含笑向衆揮杖而入、諸閣員旋絡釋而至、面容嚴肅、每人皆止步由攝影員攝影、羣衆始終毫無歡呼等之表示、會議由首相鮑爾溫主席、閣員二十二人全體出席、討論之方針如下、</p>
<p>（一）探討大局、特別注重墨索里尼拒絕英法和平解决爭案之建議、</p>
<p>（二）考慮九月四日國聯行政院會議時政府所應取之政策、</p>
<p>（三）研究政府禁發輸往意國或阿國一切軍火執照之决議、</p>
<p>會議雖歷時甚久、而午後唐寗街聚集之羣衆逐漸增多、皆候閣員之散出、警察時時使之栘動、以免交通堵塞、</p>
<p>晨間集議三小時、午後一時休會進餐、二時三十分復開會、至四時三十分散會、自治領大臣湯姆士於離相邸時語衆曰、「吾人今已討論完畢、」諸閣員大約明日復將重作假期之遊樂、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英法兩政府今日向意政府表示九月四日國聯行政院開會時意國派代表出席之希望、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外委會建議　恪守國聯盟約　倫敦泰晤士報露骨表示</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日內閣舉行緊急會議時、外交委員會將建議英國應恪守國聯盟約下之義務、聞此為該委員會昨夜透澈討論意阿爭議之結果、並决議、如國聯行政院贊同對意實施制裁、則英國當以此為應付大局之最後方法、現信英政府如持此態度、則法國亦將同情傾向之、該委員會聆不管部閣員艾登報告巴黎、二國會議之經過情形、及外相霍爾發表對該問題之意見後、乃有此堅决主張、</p>
<p>昨晚五時曾舉行閣員緊急會議、由首相鮑爾溫主席、除霍爾及艾登外、出席者有掌璽大臣麥唐納·財相張伯倫及內相西門、</p>
<p>今日之內閣緊急會議定晨間十時開始、此為不常有之事、足證其討論歷時必久、或須經一全日也、衆信會議中不致議及英國政策之詳細子目、惟將决定大綱、聞內閣對於對意實施制裁一點、意見互分、主張制裁者皆信此舉不致引起嚴重之後果、其餘閣員則以為英國應專以限制戰爭於菲洲為務、、按自一九三一年發生政潮、閣員數人脫離麥唐納、麥氏乃組織舉國一致政府以還、、唐寗街在八月間未有如昨日之活動者、羣衆竚立相邸外、以觀閣員與其他主要政洽家之來去者、實繁有徒、並有許多攝影員及英報與外報代表集於門首、</p>
<p>聞內閣外交委員會討論今日內閣會議之、議程分三項如下、</p>
<p>（一）艾登報吿巴黎三國會議之經過、</p>
<p>（二）英政府在日內瓦應取之態度、</p>
<p>（三）軍火輸往意阿問題、</p>
<p>昨日外相霍爾與澳洲·紐絲倫及加拿大駐英辦事大員及南愛自由邦代表之談話、聞全為探詢性質、蓋請彼等各向其政府探詢對若干點之意見也、外傳霍爾接見美、代辦阿塞頓時、曾請美國變更態度、茲負責方面指此說全無根據、</p>
<p>霍爾及艾登今日曾與各政黨領袖及政治家前輩如邱吉爾等會晤、蓋擬使彼等知因今日內閣會議結果英政府所將進行之政策之一般方針、此種談話、其性質實為創見、亦足證政府目前無意在十月二十九日以前召集國會也（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論謂九月四日或以後如國聯行政院决定意國犯有侵略行為、則英國朝野必須應付彼等準備實施何種制裁之問題、意阿事伴牽涉許多問題、今有人主張不過問之政策、但國人天良業已感動、國聯必須有不以墨紫里尼為懼之表示、如英國首先倡義、而向日內瓦提出確實辦法、則國聯卽可有此表示、制裁性質、固非立卽决定之事件、但各國考慮此事愈早、則實施時愈有效力云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國參院　通過中立法案　英未邀請援引非戰公約</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日照例接見記者、當時曾稱、以彼所知、英國並未邀請美國援引凱洛公約、以資共同應付意阿爭端、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國現積極進行在未來戰爭中保持美國中立之法案、昨夜羅總統赫爾國務總理及衆院外交委員會主席麥克萊諾開會時、聞羅總統等皆贊同國會立法案將何時應禁止軍火出口、及此禁令僅對侵略國而發、抑或施諸交戰國之問題聽令總統酌行之、羅總統與外交委員會皆反對參院所通過强令總統於他國開戰時宣布禁止軍火輸出之議案、衆意此事或可有折衷辦法、一方面許總統作關於禁令之决定、一方面規定禁令須施諸各交戰國、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據晨報接得倫敦消息、美國駐英代辦阿德頓、曾以本國政府名義、向英國霍爾外相聲明、羅斯福總統業已决定、斷不牽入意阿爭端之中、該報又謂、華盛頓方面消息、證實美國對於意阿戰事所可發生之影響、亦不擬向任何國家徵求意見云、又巴黎廻聲報亦與晨報發表同樣消息、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）宣傳部長齊亞諾行將統率空軍赴菲、墨索里尼首相復派職團會議議員阿爾斐利為其代表前往、彼現年三十九歲、係作家協會會長、並係朱蘭國家主義團髒之創辦人、自始卽贊成法西斯運動、當選議員已久、現在米蘭為律師、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利日報今日載有蓋達氏所著一文、題曰「意大利與英倫非交爭而為合作、」論調與其近來所發表之論文逈不相同、內謂、意國並無仇英之普遍情慨、法西斯意大利之政策恒以誠摯積極之合作為歸宿、此項合作發源於歐洲、應推及全世界各部外、菲洲亦在其列云、按蓋達向為意政府之喉舌、今忽變其論調、衆信乃由英政府與英報一部分表示之團結精神所致、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）紀事報金融專家今日謂、英國五大銀行之一已收回所有對意放欵、大概其他四行亦將仿行、據稱此項行動、並非由於政府授意、而爲一種通常之預防、因意國外匯地位已經大爲降低云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）每日郵報阿京特派員今日報吿、阿皇與各族酋長及顧問會議之後、已决下總動員令、惟迄今尙無官報證實此項消息、倘係確實、則可見阿皇已視巴黎會議之失敗、表示戰爭已無可避免矣云、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿國皇帝頃向倫敦每日電聞報訪員發表談話、謂『萬一國聯會竟吿失敗、意阿戰爭竟致爆發、則我國之所最感困難者、厥為缺乏必需之軍火、夫意阿戰事、將使其他各國捲入漩渦、一如一九一四年之往事，此則不能不令余目擊而心傷者、又如國聯會孱弱無能、則並世各國、泰半將重陷於一九一四年局勢之中、所謂安全保障、不可復得矣、但余仍信國聯會、將竭其全力、以避免戰爭之爆發也』、阿皇繼謂、最近意報曾稱、阿國已開始攻擊意軍、余對此種「臆造之戰鬬」、實不勝抱憾、又謂阿國準備重提建議、請求國聯會派遣公正委員會、調査爭端眞相、「蓋將藉是以表暴余坦白澄潔之信心也」、其結語曰、「萬一和平解决之努力、均歸失敗、則一八九六年阿杜亞一役、阿軍之勝利、必將重演於今日、此則余可斷言者也」云云、（二十一日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>意領事受槍傷　據云係行獵誤擊</h3>
<p>阿京　意大利駐在戴布拉馬克期之領事法孔尼今日遭人槍擊、卽舁入醫院、究為何人所擊、不得而知、據意使館稱、係行獵誤傷云、（什二日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　意大利領事法孔尼男爵昨日前往德勃瑪爾哥斯城、幷在途中受槍傷一事、頃據阿比西尼亞政府發表正式公報云、法孔尼男爵係於二十一日正午由阿京率領駱駝隊前往德勃瑪爾哥斯城任所、中途離開駝隊、單身前進、其待役牽驢一頭、緊隨在後、突聞槍聲兩響、繼之以呻吟聲、乃急往探視、則見男爵胸部已受槍傷、當卽將男爵送回阿京、業於今晨五時到達、幷昇往意國一元療治、阿國政府頃已開始調查事變眞相云云、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>東菲風雲緊急　證券市場暗淡　港銀亦受影響暴跌</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國各機關與各交易所今日皆極盼英內閣會議之消息、證券市場氣象暗淡、各種股票價皆低落、物品市場則大都價漲、小麥棉花玉粟黍及五金物皆因戰事恐慌、價格高漲、外匯市塲意幣掛牌價格在嚴密管理之下、但三個月期之匯票則須貼現七里拉、現貨成交頗多、但不照掛牌給價、貼現較掛牌為大、銀行家與出口商現皆不願以金融接濟意國、亦不願將到期債欵展期、據彙聞報所得消息、五大銀行之一已决定收回對意全部受欵矣、巴黎與紐約亦皆不願墊欵、故意國將從何處籌借戰費、乃一疑問、因意國財政現已處於危險地位也（二十日日路透電）</p>
<p>（香港）意阿開戰可能、及英國强硬態度、已影饗及此間通貨、港銀近曾高漲、但今晨則暴跌、上星期港銀一千元可兌省銀一千五百二十二元、但現僅可兌省銀一千四百五十五元、按歐戰時港銀之價格曾低於省銀、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫政局　新黨成立後內閣將改組</h3>
<p>貝爾格勒　此間自「南斯拉夫急進聯合黨」成立之後、聞史多雅第諾維區內閣不久皍將改組、緣新政黨係聯合前塞爾維亞族急進黨·波斯尼省回敎黨·及斯羅文人民黨組織而成、惟前塞爾維亞族右派民主黨及克羅地族各黨决不加入、因此屬於各該黨之閣員數人、勢將辭職、而由新黨黨員接充、大約內閣改組、將在八月二十九日小協商各國政治會議在勃勒特城開會之前實現云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>第三國際今昔　旣不復談「世界革命」　且願與資本國家合作</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）第三國際第七屆大會頃已宣吿結束、經過情形甚為鎭靜、可謂有組織而缺乏自動性、前此特羅資基掌權時、第三國際輒以世界革命為口號、此次之口號則係反抗汎繫主義與帝國主義、實與以前歷屆大會不同、自茲以還、世界革命雖係第三國際之最後目的、但認為尙屬遼遠、未可一蹴而就、因而第三國際所採用之策略亦具有相當柔性、俾與現行狀况相適應、要而言之、第三國際頃已成為蘇俄之藩籬、而用以抵抗外來勢力、幷保衛蘇俄社會主義所已舉之成績、至此後所當採用之策略、第三國際頃已承認與資本主義國相提携、甚至主張與「任何國」締結同盟、祇須此項國家擁護和平、於願已足、蘇俄蓋以和平保護人自任也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>孟買銀市停閉不確</h3>
<p>孟買　上海所傳孟買銀市現已停閉之說、毫無根據、實則銀市買賣不許在固定的最低價格之下、卽第一屆交割價格六十四羅比一三、第二屆交割價格六十五羅比零一是也、銀市形勢頗形緊張、昨日理事會會議未能决定對於銀價應採之步驟、蓋以銀商列昌摩啻昌公司之事伴刻在司法進行中也、該公司已向高等法院請求註銷裁判、交易所理事會定今日再開會議、（廿二日路透電）</p>

<h3>暹羅實施强迫教育　仍嚴厲壓迫華僑　潮劇要求創辦伶校遭受拒絕　華僑學生不准穿着中國服裝</h3>
<p>（申時社）暹羅政府自决意排華後、即　量壓迫我華僑、取消各校强迫班、增加暹文課程、絡續封閉華僑學校、達七十九所、雖迭經我華僑代表與暹敎育部交涉、迄未有何結果、其後雖經我國朝野倡議抵制暹米、以施制裁、然暹方依舊剛愎自用、一意孤行、排華氣燄、迄未稍减、最近府並下令禁止華僑學生穿着華服、並嚴止潮劇「中正順』班要求創辦童伶學校、亦被拒絕、申時社記者、茲向本埠某僑務機關、探得各情如下、</p>
<p>華僑學生禁着華服　暹呑武里府烏克羅縣屬之平民學校、其中頗多巳屆受强迫教育學齡之華僑子弟肄業、但彼等之服裝多衣家居常服、為該縣敎育局特下令華籍學生一律改衣暹服、華僑學生之家長方面、以中國國有之衣飾為口實、不允改換、結果敎育局方面即下令不准華籍學生入校肄讀、此令發出後一般華籍學生家長乃聯名向武里府議昌鐢披匿威特潘報告種切、並要求向府當局交涉、鐢披匿接得是項聲請後、嘗在會議中向府方提出質問、但迄今仍未有完滿答復、查暹羅對於平民學校學生之衣飾素無明文規定、平日均依其家境狀况、自由穿着、僅於遇有舉行重要典禮時、始臨時穿着制服、故此項舉動、顯屬有意壓逼華僑、</p>
<p>創辦伶校竟被拒絕　暹敎育部前為實施强迫敎育起見、去年嘗訓令曼谷各潮劇班主凡各伶童、年齡在强迫期內者、須一律入校讀書、當時各班主奉令後、即着各伶童報名入學、但各伶童因本身職業關係、實際每月所受敎育時間僅三四日左右、一年亦僅足一月、敎育為求伶童得受相當敎育機會、免違犯强迫敎育條例起見、均特邀集各潮劇班主、在各潮劇班內、試辦伶童學校、各班主當表示贊同、即在東舞臺東湖杭州三戲院內、試辦學校三所、直接隸屬敎部、各校所有敎員及管理、皆由敎部負責、成績當有相當可觀、最近中正順班班主、亦上書暹敎部請求在院內自辦伶童學校、詎意敎部竟以「以上三校尙在試辦期間、俟有結果、再行擴充」之理由拒絕請求、但據華僑方面探悉、則暹敎部將俟以上三班學生修竣、不再繼續辦理、即仍令各潮劇班伶童、入學校讀書云、</p>

<h3>小男兒（廿三）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>華毘蘭便是斯各脫人所稱為「天眞」的，因為，雖然還是十三歲了，他却還像一個六歲的稚子。他從前是異常聰明，她的父親又催逼得太快了，給他種種繁難的功課，要他做書本的功夫每天有六小時之多，希望他吸引知識有如北京鴨子呑下强塡進去的食物。他自想眞是盡了父親的責任了，然而他幾乎殺了他的孩子，囚為一次熱病便不得不使他輟學，等到病好了以後，那個曾經使用過度的腦子忽然失其功用，於是毘蘭的心思像了一塊石板，經過了海絨的洗刷，竟也是空無所有了。</p>
<p>這，對於他抱有一腔熱望的父親，自是一大打擊；他不忍見他前程遠大的孩子一旦竟變成一個白痴的廢物，於是送他到梅莊，並不希望他還能有多少進步，不過知道他必受善待的。他是多麽柔順而和氣！然而也眞可憐看他學習得多辛苦呀，彷彿是還在暗中摸索他旣失的知識，這，原巳是費了他那麽多精力的。他天天將字母仔細看過，得意揚揚說着A和B，想來他巳認得它們了，可是到了明天，一點踪跡也沒有，於是整部功夫又得從新做起。裴先生以無窮的忍耐功夫去敎道他，雖然這伴事看起總是無望，他還是　而不舍，他並不注重書本的功課，祇是和柔地想從他朦朦的心思上去撥開那重重的雲霧，還他足够的知慧，以圖减少其生命中的痛苦。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>當我們着起一身很淸潔的衣衫，走在雨後泥濘極滑的道路上，如臨深淵，如履薄冰，深恐有點汚泥，濺到身上，否則一失足傾仆，渾似泥鰍，那是多麽可恨！可是我們再聯想到自己立足在社會上，對於自己的名譽，也非這樣的小心保持不可。</p>
<p>衣服齷齪了，用肥皂去洗滌，尤其在天氣炎熱時，換洗得更股勤：因為要保持他原有的淸潔。我們旣知道衣服汚垢，是不合衛生，是有碍美觀；於是我們再反省自己的過失，是怎樣的為他人所詬病，所以我們常常要存着，「十目所視，十手所指」的印象，而和衣服一樣的勤換勤洗；然而在這裏，我們還須記牢「過則勿憚改」這句古訓！</p>
<p>大力士舉起了千斤的石擔，兩手運用自如，毫不面紅氣喘；假使換箇弱者去使動它，那不但不能舉過頭頂，而且臉也紅了，氣也喘了！可見一件責任，要相吻合的人才去擔負，才得井井有條，可是在現代呢，那千斤的石擔兒，無需自己的力量去舉起它，祇要有旁人的力量，就行了；所以現下，有不知幾何的大力士，鬧着「英雄無用武之地」的不景氣啦。</p>
<h3>漱六山房軼事</h3>
<p>— 嬰寗</p>
<p>漱六山房主人張春帆先生，已淤月之十日因病謝世矣。小說家前輩，又弱一個，良可扼腕。不佞追隨先生者數載，知先生較稔，記其軼事，為讀吾報者告。</p>
<p>先生籍隸武進，而居於吳下者久，故操吳儂軟語甚流利。其所著『九尾龜』說部，亦因雜以吳語，而膾炙人口。先生作『九尾龜』時，年二十有七，初成十六回，於小除夕，持稿見本館張繼齋先生（時繼齋先生任本報主筆），卽由本館為刋印行世。先生得稿費三十金，以此度歲，引為大樂。翌年又成十六回，仍由本館出版，其後陸續列印至十二集始止。當時家弦戶誦，幾無人不知有『九尾龜』也。</p>
<p>民十八年間，先生深慨乎國事之日非，乃三上張學良將軍書，暢論治國之道　蓋維時張氏方承父餘蔭，雄視東北，識者以為它日能奠國家於磐石者，舍張氏莫屬也。顧先生之言，張氏卒不能用，及瀋變起，則張氏且顚躓於外，不獲歸其故土矣。</p>
<p>先生好觀電影，以所居近中央大戲院，每值換片，恒偕其佩娟夫人往，而擇座必最前列，以先生目患短視故也。先生又每以觀影所見，為文月旦，刋諸報端。今日『影評人』三字，已成為專門名稱，而先生則允為『影評人』之先進也。</p>
<p>袖箭，爲技擊中之一種，先生少年時嘗習之。予以『九尾龜』中嘗有袖箭遞簡之記述，一日晤先生，叩以用法，先生乃於書室中試演，以無短箭，則取筆代之。筆稈之端抵中指，銅筆套之一端置腕側，向上彈之，着力處全在中指。先生自言，少時體本不甚魁梧，及功夫旣散（少年時精於技擊），始突然肥碩也。</p>
<p>先生晚年，着武俠小說甚多。寫至較藝處，必先於室中試演進擊抵拒之勢一過，然後落筆，其愼重蓋如此，視今之率爾操觚者，有愧先生多矣。</p>
<h3>事物名稱的研究</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>事物的名稱，很有可以研究資爲談助的。覺得一事一物之要討人歡喜，必須加上美好的字眼，尤其是吃的東西，非有香咧甜咧一類的贊美來衝動人們的食慾不可。但是仔細思索，却有適得其反的，譬如賣豆腐乾的，總是稱為五香豆腐乾。然而旁晚時侯，那挑着擔兒油汆臭豆腐乾喚賣的，人家不因它臭而掩鼻，反紛紛的蘸着辣醬，大啖而特啖。可知香的固屬可愛，臭的也不致取憎。又賣瓜的總是自稱瓜甜，甚至佐粥之品，有甜醬瓜。不料昨天瞧見某飲食舖的廣告：「苦瓜為廣州著名之植物，味微苦，有淸火解熱之功。因特製苦瓜炒牛肉，苦瓜炒雞片等應時名肴，以供同好」。那麼苦的和甜的也各據一席了。滬諺不是稱事物的惡劣為桂花麽，甚至一般白相人，稱醜陋的婦女，叫做桂花寡老，似乎事物加上桂花，便沒有人來請敎，眞不知那飄香的金粟，倒了什麽的運兒，然而糕糰舖逢到年底賣年糕，却又掛着桂花年糕的招牌，堂堂皇皇的揭着桂花毫不忌諱，這豈不奇哉怪哉，又有稱霉為白花的，譬如醫生沒有人臨診的，叫做白花郎中，吃的東西白花了，便不合衛生，不適口胃，但是賣百合的，却喚着白花百合，白花的較尋常的要貴上許多，觀此可見天下原沒有什麼具是非，眞善惡，口味的香臭甜苦，是小而顯著罷哩。</p>
<h3>荷鋤日當午</h3>
<p>— （徐豪吾）</p>
<p>該是「六月不熱，五榖不結」的時候。</p>
<p>大地一團火。田岸上，癩狗絕了踪；祗剩大　帽下得農夫，赤露着黝黑的皮膏，緊張着瘦萎的筋肉，冒暑不停地夾雜在苗條的靑枝綠葉裏裏勞作着。</p>
<p>去年一年旱——白忙，賠本，纍纍的債，餓癟的肚皮。</p>
<p>今年雨雖然來遲一點，來後又點滴不停；可是辛苦種下的東西，天照應，沒給別處連天的白浪奪流冲刷而去。看情形，要是能盡力的話……。</p>
<p>「荷鋤日當午，汗滴禾下土……」</p>
<p>汗是血，祗要血能够灌溉禾苗；力是生命，祇要生命能够挽救一切！</p>
<p>浮華，頽唐——絕離了歪曲現實的都市，纔見希望，積極，犧牲——人生的眞義。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十八回　戚黨高攀逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>藍專員在幾個招待員招待之下，自向特定的房間裏去休息。張介夫隨着歡迎人員，也不過是止於樓下那個大客廳裏。雖是自己十分的把態度裝得大方起來，無如這裏的歡迎人員，他們都互相認識，只有自己孤零零地坐在一邊。那些人，先前也以為他必是和專員有些關係的人物，後來看到他，也雜在大家一處，便覺他有些來歷不明，都不免把眼睛向他看了去。他抽抽烟捲，喝喝茶，背了兩手，在屋子裏踱着幾個來回。時間久了，這也就緩緩的現出窘狀來了。不過他總極力的支持着，不肯將窘狀，完全露出，郤繞了墻基走着，向墻上看那玻璃框子裏裝的畫片。這時有人道，藍先生說，不知道各位還在這裏等着，所以逕直德上樓去了。各個都有公事，不敢再耽誤，都購回，一會兒，藍先生定去分頭回拜。張介夫這時回頭看得淸，正式書記裘則誠。等他把話說完，也不管那些歡迎代表，要如何和他接洽，自己搶上前兩步，點頭又作揖的，笑着叫道：姐夫姐夫！剛才我在大門口歡迎專員，怎麽沒有看到你呢？（二九七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>至太后自己把面部的化裝施行妥善以後，便敎人出去招呼那御用理髪匠走進來給伊承值；這個理髪匠自然也是太監，可是據同伴們告訴我，他的技術之精熟，在中國可稱獨步，沒有一個能和他比擬的人，所以太后也非常的信用他，時常讚譽着。但在那理髮匠自己，郤未必很願意為太后承值；第一就因為太后的脾氣太不好，動輒要受責駡，使他常覺戰戰兢兢地像在給一頭老虎抓癢一般。有時候偶一不小心，多給太后梳下了幾許頭髮來，或是梳的時候，碰痛了伊一些，那就不能饒恕了，總得立即拖出去責打幾十下宮杖，杖完還得進來承值；不過這種情形究竟是極難得碰到的，卽使多梳了幾許頭髮下來，他也有很快的手法，會瞞過太后，悄悄地遞給站在他近旁的那個宮娥去丟掉。我想宮娥們肯這樣帮着他作弊，少不得總可以打他那裏索取一些財物，卽使如此，他自己也還值得，總比給太后瞧見了挨打幾十下屁股好些；何况打屁股還不是頂兇的責罰，太后未必一定就會滿足，說不定還有更大的禍事呢！（三九七）</p>
<h3>雨露</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>朝晨，他還安靜地睡在床上，矇矓中忽然聽見街上滾過去的車輪發出「吱吱……」的聲音，他猜想天是落雨了；果然當他跳下床，拉開沿街的窗帘的時候，風雨已經很緊急的在樓頭飄打着了。</p>
<p>想到伊人的邀約，勢必為這風雨所阻，他的心上不免浮起一層鬱悶。（他在憎恨着風雨呢！）</p>
<p>拖着沉重的脚步走下樓，去到小院，猛然看見連日不勝驕陽壓迫而枯萎了的花草，現在因為獲得雨露的潤澤又復活了。「自然的力量眞偉大呀，怎能以個人的愛憎為愛憎呢！」他不禁這樣地嘆息起來。同時他想：「雨露能滋生萬物，人為甚麼不能樂用它而反要厭恨它呢？」他想着連自也慚愧起來。</p>
<p>他走下庭階，立在雨中，凉爽的雨點滴落在他的臉上，生命的綠樹受着雨露的灌溉，青春的心靈似乎已經和雨露溶化在一起了。</p>
<p>誌謝　名醫李武城博士，前卒業同濟臀科大學，旋主任寳隆醫院內科有年，今春又榮獲德國醫學博士學位，自設診所於成都路修德新邨二弄二號，美名所播，病者踵接，李氏復鑒於戒烟實屬當務之急，爰引用科學原理，研究戒烟妥善方法，更就臨診經騐，著有戒烟論一書，（實售一角，函索附郵十一分即寄，）昨承惠贈一冊，特此誌謝。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>大西洋中的女王</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>世界最大的東西，層出不窮。飛艇飛機輪船橋樑，各國都竭力建造，以獲得世界最大為榮。法國拿爾姆奇號輪船，是世界最大的旅客船了。設備的豪華和容積的龐大，堪和德國的齊泊林飛船，俄國巳燬的高爾基號飛機鼎足而三。「大西洋中的女王」的徽號，確是受之無愧。</p>
<p>拿爾姆奇號是法國桑娜才娃造船公司所建。從一九三二年開始到今年落成，共計四年，不知費了幾千科學家的心血，才有此種特殊的結晶品。它吃水七萬九千二百餘噸，長度一零九二呎較巴黎鐵塔為高，建築費八千三百萬元。今歲五月二十九日從李哈維爾港出發，於六月三日即到達紐約。橫斷大西洋，僅費九十六小時，為任何輪船所望塵莫及。並且因船身如鯨魚，是最新式的流綫型。所以不論風浪潮汛，都可不受影饗，照處女航的結果，保證來往兩地的時間，可無幾分鐘的差誤。至於船身平穩，任何人可以感不到暈船的痛苦，不走到甲板上面，幾可忘其置身船中。</p>
<p>當你走到甲板上，還是找不到一個通風管，連一條鍊條都看不見的。設計精密周詳，於此可見。普通的輪船，機器的聲音，終難於避免。而拿爾姆奇號却已改去了此種弊病。它因為要防火的關係，所以全船的墻壁中間，都嵌有不能燃燒的石綿。即不幸而發生火警，到了一定的溫度，室內的火警報知器，就可通知消防隊。一方面室內的通風管，因機械的巧妙，便自動關閉，使養氣斷絕。此種墻壁不僅足以防火，且可阻止機聲的侵擾，一舉兩得。</p>
<p>你倘然有錢的話，可以在船裏過度一生，不想登岸。它可以說沒有冬季，船裏有闊而長的玻璃廊，和暖房一樣。躺在沙發上，能飽受暖陽的溫存。船內分三層，有昇降機十一架，運輸旅客。汽車倉庫，可容百輛轎車。旅客在船裏玩厭了，不妨到甲板上去乘一次飛機，在靑雲裏去玩了一回，再來乘輪船。船內有可容三百餘人的華麗劇塲，電影戲劇歌舞都有。此外攝影塲，無綫電娛樂等消閒塲所，也有八九處。兒童則另有特殊的設備。西人喜歡養狗，所以連狗房浴池，也應有盡有。船內游泳池很大，足以玩弄水球，雖在夏天，仍和住在海水浴塲一樣。</p>
<p>西人又喜歡揷花，或以鮮花贈答。從前船內均無鮮花，甚覺不便。獨拿爾姆奇號內竟有花圃，每日發售鮮花，供旅客贈答，亦是創舉。船內食物足供步兵一隊的食用，全用電氣烹調，每次燒七百六十八隻鷄的菜肴。它用電力發動，四萬馬力的發電機四架，計十六萬馬力。我國大都市，如上海廣州漢口等處的電力廠，或者可以和它相比。因為它所發的電力，足以維持人口三十萬都市的需用呢。</p>
<p>這秩龐大的輪船，有四百人即可駕駛了。但是現在船內職員水手侍者，統計達一千餘人。這其餘的六七百人，都是侍奉旅客，與女王的本身是毫無關係的。</p>

<p>金鷄晨跌午回標紗前市開盤、各月一致下落、近月敲破七十一元關口、局勢益覺虛弱、因本月份空方準備交貨、業巳實行、有某紗解進倉庫中、多方收貨與否、尙無相當的辦法、於是浮多更現不安之狀、賣氣稍盛、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌六·八·九角至一元一角、午後開盤市情徐徐上升、謂標金漲風驟起、致一部分空頭抵補而堅、但現紗銷塲仍舊岑寂、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲五·六·八·角、查賣出大孚一千一百五十包、裕大三百包、大豐二千二百五十包、愼記一千九百包、義成三百包、合興二百包、長餘五百包、恒昌八百包、新昌六百包、裕康三百包、通記六百包、益大五百包、振大四百包、泰昌一千二百五十包、潤康四百包、大昶五百包、生源八百五十包、信誠六百五十包、長豐八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>鄭標轉昂標花前市開盤、八月期又見昂勢、漲一角、但拍至遠月較爲鬆動、因天氣良好、甯波太倉帮在近月套賣、致檯面略形鬆懈、結果本月比上日收盤價漲三角半、遠氣尤激、一般說者謂多頭方面、决定收貨、於是人心驟緊、結果本月比上日收盤價漲三角半、遠跌五分至一角半、午後開盤、近月平、遠月見硬、聞標金復漲、人氣激昂、空頭抵補、結果本月比上午收盤價跌五分、遠漲一角半至二角半、查賣出大孚二千五百担、達記一千担、同豐二千一百担、愼記五千五百担、長豐二千五百担、長和一千六百担、合興一千担、生源一千二百担、益豐一千一百担、買進元一一千七百担、潤康二千一百担、生源一千一百担、永昌一千六百担、益康三千五百担、賡豐一千二百担、慎昌二千六百担、同興一千担、長豐一千六百担、畏和一千担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　九月起粉廠取銷加價</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份市面、均見穩定、因洋麥報價、芝加哥續漲六七角左右、坎拿大漲三五角左右、市塲人心、以洋麥連漲、未免稍稍注意、乃國內實銷、仍少發展、惟來源不繼、前途難免發生影響、故廠出停手、市價遂喊起近分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因傳從下月份起、各廠五分加價、將自動取銷、致本月份之立場、不免搖過交易稀少，下午八九萬包耳、結果本月份較小一分、九月份好一分、十月份至一月份各漲一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>坎加麥作皆有損害　本埠麥市意在觀望</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、市呈岑寂、以市塲交易廖寥、業內外均觀望居多、故洋麥雖續漲五六七角不等、近遠期市面、迄少動靜即交易亦極不暢、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣、突見軟弱、因粉市不振、且市上之現麥去化、未見活絡、井因某行家有洋麥套售、人心遂益覺軟疲、而本月份巳近交割、多頭脫手甚少、價尤虛弱、結果本月份跌四分、九月份跌三分、十月份跌一分、十一月份好一分、現麥因廠方互搜、仍無正式見交云、</p>
<p>又國外小麥、傳加拿大有霜、作物發現紅黑班點、損壤不少、又傳加麥之出口頗佳、溫尼沛市面極挺、據阿根廷消息、該處遲遲播種、情勢嚴重、市面之動作甚佳、</p>

<h3>糖市　潮靑仍在上漲中</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金內盤轉緊、曾到一·八四四、故趨勢稍緊、公會劃盤如二四組砂白、以及太古糖本廠棉白等均乏上落、惟潮靑因號貨已屬無幾、行存亦告單薄、因此趨勢甚緊、昨黃崗靑呌十元半、高隆靑呌九元七角、尙未成盤、海南赤行號間談價尙差一角、相持未開、市象漸平、</p>
<h3>南北貨　木耳湘蓮產價均漲</h3>
<p>木耳前以銷路稍呆、漢市辦價曾到八十八元、但近日各帮去胃復動、趨勢突緊、昨據漢口訊、須九十二元、比前回升四元、高魁耳尤覺軋缺、供不應求、前價為一百二十二元四角、現需一百三十一二元、計漲八元許、湘蓮近亦節節回振、昨據產區電訊、九溪蓮巳由三十一元許升至三十三元、比漲二元許、後市仍看續緊、申市因亦隨高云、</p>
<h3>五金　靑島帮大辦烟皮鐵</h3>
<p>三六尺三張至十張烟皮鐵、近數日來、靑島帮狂辦不巳、全市開出達七百餘担、行情因之節節上升、每担開七元三角半、比前又好二角、而天津烟毫各帮、亦多指辦、所以市上問津者衆多、惟調查存底十分單薄、苟月內再無到貨、前途不免有斷檔之憂、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從辜鴻銘的蠻勁說起</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>胡適之先生在天津大公報的文藝副刋裏，寫了一篇「記辜鴻銘」，他告訴我們辜鴻銘先生的一點逸事。逸事裏是可以看出一個人的眞性情來的。所以那篇文章雖然並不長，郤把辜先生的性格！包括蠻勁在內——淸淸楚楚地烘托到紙上了，這功力眞不小。</p>
<p>辜鴻銘先生的蠻勁，是天下聞名的。現在，胡適之先生肯從記憶裏摘些舊事下來，搜羅蠻氣，給些佐證，那自然更出色。</p>
<p>而我們也實在很想看看這出色的蠻勁。</p>
<p>胡先生所記的逸事，頂能够顯出辜鴻銘的蠻勁的，那是關於辮子的幾段。據說辜鴻銘當要出洋的時候，受了他父親嚴厲的囑咐，不得把辮子剪去。所以他到了蘇格蘭，受盡侮辱，却還是讓「猪尾巴」留在腦後，不過後來終於剪下來送給一個「識貨」的姑娘了。這以後他就變了「假洋鬼子」。一直到辛亥革命，才又留了起來，但是帶上的却是假辮子，坐着馬車到處亂跑，「猪尾巴」大出風頭。</p>
<p>民國以後，對於那條辮子，他還是念念不忘。在張動生日那一天，他送了一副對聯，叫做：「荷盡巳無擎雨蓋，菊殘猶有傲霜枝。」據說明，擎雨蓋是淸朝的大帽，傲霜枝呢，郤是他老先生自己的和張大帥的兩條辮子。</p>
<p>別人革命，他偏尊王，別人剪髮，他偏拖着辮子，這就叫做蠻勁，的確是江浙人所不大懂的。因為這種行為在江浙人看來，是頑固。蠻勁有好有壞，而頑固卻無論如何是壞的。</p>
<p>江浙人喜歡掉文袋，郤不愛伸奉頭，在大體上，是的確的。但伸拳頭的結果，正可以是叩響頭；掉文袋雖然太沒有武士氣，然而郤也還可以有蠻子氣的。譬如吧，淸朝文字獄的主角，就有不少是浙江人。倘以辜鴻銘比起呂晚村來，那相去的鴻溝，是非常遼闊，而且大家能够明白的。</p>
<p>還有，乾隆三十九年八月，下詔購求遺書，那詔旨說：</p>
<p>明季造野史者甚多，其間譽任意，傳聞異詞，必有詆觸本朝之語，正當及此一番查辦，盡行銷毀，杜遏邪言，以正人心而厚風俗，斷不宜置之不辦。此等筆墨妄議之事，大率江浙兩省居多，其江西，閩，粵，湖，廣亦或不免，豈可不細加查　？……</p>
<p>乾隆五十七年，又諭：</p>
<p>……江西，江蘇，浙江等省分較大，素稱人文之淵藪，民間書籍繁多，所以不能禁絕者，皆由督撫等視為等閒耳。……</p>
<p>弘曆的特別重視江蘇和浙江，並非無因的。講圓通，誤幽默的傢伙，在江浙文人中畢竟是少數；江浙文人大抵還有一點蠻勁，不大容易入壳的，如方孝孺，如顧炎武，如金聖嘆，而實際幹起來的，僅就明末而諭，也還有張蒼水，吳日生，陳臥子，夏考功等，他們簡直是不能安於做文人了，但他們是文人。</p>
<p>這就因為有蠻勁。</p>
<p>然而辜鴻銘呢？讚小脚，留辮子，招搖過市，我們只見其古怪，滑稽，可憐，還有什麽呢？</p>
<h3>某夜</h3>
<p>— 何為</p>
<p>記得那晚雨落得很急。一片萬馬奔騰似的聲音，尤其增驟了雨勢。</p>
<p>我坐在一張籘椅子上面，傾聽着雨聲。這時夜巳很深了。我俯社着　在我們窗下的，巨獸般的城市，却只見到一片深淵似的漆黑。</p>
<p>瞌睡壓倒了我的掙扎。雖則一個同床睡覺的朋友還在外面，但我却沉得地倒在大木床上，朦朧地睡去。</p>
<p>可是我又很快地醒了轉來。我聽到開房門和收雨傘的，奇怪的聲音。</p>
<p>「誰？可是阿芳？』</p>
<p>『不，是老徐。』</p>
<p>是輕聲的，沙啞的回答。在這難受的聲昔中，還夾雜着斷斷續續的咳嗽。</p>
<p>『怎麽你這麽深夜跑來？』我氣憤憤地問這位窮朋友實在有點使我討厭。其實他是阿芳的朋友，跟我還不怎樣親密的。可是他一來就是揩油，不是借錢，就是吃飯，難道他不明白我也一樣的艱苦嗎？</p>
<p>『天沒有吃飯了，又得跑……眞是……」</p>
<p>他一邊說，一邊很快地從我們的　子底下拖出飯鍋子，盛了一大碗冷飯，在上面撒了一些鹽，就那麽地吃了起來。</p>
<p>『有開水嗎？』</p>
<p>我沒有回答。</p>
<p>『最好借我五個銅子買點油花生下飯。』</p>
<p>我還是固執着沒有作聲，差不多是故意的。一種鄙視的，又像憐憫的感情激動了我，使我不能安靜。我那時剛從學校出來，還是沒有嘗到生活的苦痛，對於這種一開口就是幾天沒有吃飯的朋友，老是表示懷欵和輕視。</p>
<p>『你眞的兩天沒有吃飯？』</p>
<p>我惡意地，用着對待呌化的態度和口吻問他，彷佛我的面前，眞個站着一個下流無恥的呌化似的。</p>
<p>他吃驚得仰起頭來。他那一種困惑的神情，更引起我的忿怒。我吐着一口痰，用脚猛擦着地板說：</p>
<p>『你說謊，兩天沒有吃飯！哼，一個人不是草紥的，難道餓得了兩天嗎？』</p>
<p>我看到他那一雙死魚似的眼睛，很快地糢糊起來了，他那一雙瘦瘠的手彷彿　攣着。</p>
<p>『你說什麽？』</p>
<p>他突然地放下飯碗，捲起袖子，把它一直捲到細得像麥桿似的臂裸上，似乎要跟我大發雷霆的樣子。但馬上在他臉上掠過一陣陰鬱的，忍耐的笑容。他笑着說：</p>
<p>『不，你還是什麽都不懂的，朋皮！現在你决不會懂得在目前，一個人餓幾天肚子，除了喝一點開水，什麼東西都沒得吃的事，並不是我揑造出來的聊話。你不會懂得的，可是生活會使你慢慢地相信……」</p>
<p>但我却嗤着鼻子，不願首肯。他又舉起那隻細得像麥桿的右手，捧着飯碗，狼吞虎嚥地吃着第二碗冷飯。</p>
<p>在吃完飯以後，他就在房子的一隻角頭舖起一些舊報紙來，他知道我的脾氣，在跟他鬥氣以後，决不會給他一點被頭的，雖則天巳經很冷。他就睡在那些舊報紙上面，上身和肚子緊緊地裹着他自己穿的一件破夾襖，下身却仍然是蓋着重重疊疊的舊報紙。</p>
<p>他原想等我另外那位朋友回來，給他設法一點蓋的，但疲倦勝過了寒冷，經過很短時間的反側，他就呼呼地睡着了。</p>
<p>我却危坐在牀上，懊惱地，帶着一點慚愧的心情傾聽着雨聲。</p>
<h3>脚夫</h3>
<p>— 天基</p>
<h3>等待</h3>
<p>— 褚雅鳴</p>
<p>騰同村從前出過一個軍長，因此全村的人都很榮耀。但在我到那裏去的三年前，那個軍長巳經死掉了，他手下的軍隊有些巳經解散，有些，除了兩三個做過肥缺的軍官現在變成造洋房，娶姨太太的闊人之外，許多村人都變成無業游民。——開頭他們還肯耕田種菜，後來就完全改行，成為偷摸搶刦的匪徒了。</p>
<p>有一個女人，永還地生存在這些匪徒和其餘耕家底口裏。依驚各人底不同的習慣，她底名字也有各種的呌法，最通行的是伍二嫂，梁四嫂，李祥嫂，和傻婆。……她本來的名字，別人都記不起來了。</p>
<p>鄕團常常在她家裏捉到非常著名的大盜，但他們不傷害她，好像她跟騰同村底盛衰的歷史連結在一起，於是她也成為神聖的了。匪徒們對於她一句話都不說，甚至連是否認識她都拒絕回答；耕田佬在市集上跟別人賭咒，他們沒有給過她一個錢，而一切的好處都不過是她底施與。</p>
<p>關於她底過去，我所知道的只有一點點。</p>
<p>她底第一個丈夫呌做伍老二，是一個不知羞恥的男人，常常打她，又强迫她去賣淫。</p>
<p>那時候她還很年輕。一間貧民醫院裏面駐紮了一營兵——他們養活伍老一夫婦。常常站在營部門　守門的是梁標和李祥。他們都穿着由劣等工匠縫起來的棉大衣，灰斜布的面子磨到一塊塊的「黑虹」，發出一股酸臭發糠的味這；不穿　子，紅薯一樣的脚不甘心地套在草鞋裏面；帽子戴得歪歪地，掮着一根上了刺刀的長槍。臉上的血氣，在冬天，給寒氣趕跑了，就變成「青鷄」一樣，鼻涕無緣無故淌出來，牙齒格達格達地打震。</p>
<p>就是在冷得非常利害那一天，伍老二痛打了他底老婆。李祥忍不往了，在值勤的時候摔下了槍，跑到茅屋裏面去懲罰了伍老二一頓。因此他就銷了差。但更不幸的是那個時候伍老二巳經將老婆讓了給梁標。他們底條件是梁標在三年之內，每個月分一半餉銀給伍老二。她想出各種方法跟伍老二糾纏，可是他這樣解釋着：如果他不賣掉她，她遲早還是跟男人一道逃走的。那以後，高高大大的，說起話來時不時要摸摸鼻子的「牛精」李祥就不曉得到那裏去了。</p>
<p>梁標買了老婆之後，因為跟別人打架，也銷了差。他開頭樣樣都將就那個女人。後來慢慢就打閙起來了，他說他底女人是一個「墓敗煞」，碰到什麽男人都得給她尅住。他早上竇熟紅薯，下午賣綠荳沙或者糯米麥粥，晚上到土地廟去過夜。只有初一十五他回到茅屋裏睡覺，其餘的日子呌她自己想法子購錢。</p>
<p>有一次，一大隊兵士經過同村。沒有人能够正確地指明那些軍隊底名目，種類知數量。他們把牠叫做「神兵」。麥元，一個老而醜的菓園工匠，開始大膽地向那些神兵探詢消息，——馬上將他底老朋友，從前駐紥過騰同村的李祥發現出來了。李祥使村裏的許多人感到大的歡樂，他們請他吃飯，喝酒，賭錢，用各種方法欵待他。</p>
<p>第二天，李祥殺死了梁標，跟着大隊開走了。從那時候起，那個賣淫女人要求別人喊她做李祥嫂。——一個光榮的，快樂的名字。</p>
<p>『只有他一個人眞心愛我。』她對任何人都這樣說。『他答應不久就要回來，他不久就要回來的！』</p>
<p>『可是打仗的事情却很難說……』</p>
<p>「你敢咒他，你這黑心狗」！</p>
<p>她每天把茅屋收拾得非常乾凈，穿上整齊的衣服，並且將她底靈魂也洗得淸淸白白的。她禁止閒人和吵閙的野狗走近她底茅屋，在趕他們或打他們的時候，常常提起李祥底名字恐嚇他們。</p>
<p>我碰見她的時候，她才不過是三十二三歲的光景。她底眼睛是大而深的，她底體格粗大而强壯，全部看來是一個有威力的女人。但她實在是非常溫和，馴善的。從她身上發射出來的彷彿要溶化一切物件的光輝吸引着我去接近她，在她旁邊，我變成比我底年齡更小，同時是更懂事，更順從，而且更幸福了。</p>
<p>「你認得字？那眞好，」個女人應有這種本事。如果我認得字，我就可以寫信了！」</p>
<p>「我可以替你寫的。」</p>
<p>「你可以？你不可以的！我想寫什麽東西，怎麼想法。世界上有那麼一個心：先是用小刀把牠切碎了，使牠變成一堆肉醬，這里丟一點，那里摔一點，誰也沒有可惜過牠！………後來又把牠從所有德角落裏找出來了，拚在一起，灌點血液進去，讓牠生長起來，而且長得比從前更肥大……」牠非常吃力地捧着自己的腦袋說。</p>
<p>有時候她這樣勸告我：</p>
<p>「做出點事情來，等到你長大了，做出點事情來！一個女人只算做一堆牛屎，給他們看看！困難的，骯髒的，不好受的，有時都很不壞，自己造出自己的世界來吧。」</p>
<p>村裏面的人都知道她有許多「情人」，可是不能夠確實指出那些名字。我一個都沒有看見過。我只是常常在絕早或黃昏的時候，看見過她一個人穿着純黑的衣服，躲在樹林子裏輕聲唱着一些流行的短歌。</p>

<h3>愛情（二）</h3>
<p>— S·塞爾吉夫·晋斯基作蘇明譯</p>
<p>他在一本什麼書上讀了這個，當牠是一句在現在這種機會非常有用的話而記在心裏。這類的文句和字眼，在他看來總是異常的眞實和格外的娓娓動聽。而且，要是他知道這類話更多些，他也會對亞洛沙講出來。</p>
<p>但是矮小消瘦的亞洛沙抬頭望着他那龐大的，驚奇的臉，突然地大聲笑了出來。</p>
<p>『哈哈哈！考爾特，和愛情！哈哈哈！』</p>
<p>那樣白得耀目的平整的牙齒，他覺得，從她那笑得起了縐的眼睛裏射出的那樣的光芒！還在笑着，她在他旁邊走過去，雖然沒有誰在周圍，沙瓦卡有一個很長的時間站在那裏沒有動。好似一塊石頭在他的喉　裏，塞住了他的氣息。他緊咬着他的牙齒，他的灰色的，不和藹的眼睛注視着地面，在他的耳朶裏響着一片聲音，像是全斯拍司克村都在笑他。</p>
<p>當他終於拖着他的兩腿走回家去的時候，他咬牙切齒的說：「好的，你這女孩子。你有着一個紅的頭，但是有一顆黑的心。」</p>
<p>這是在早春的一個淸朗的日子。風吹着，屋頂在嘯，燕子淸脆的喃呢着。</p>
<p>兩天以後，沙瓦卡對他的病了的父親說：『冰正在溶解。要是你高興，我就把你用船載到市鎭上去。他們說那裏現在有一個好的躲院。也許他們會很快的醫治好你。』</p>
<p>他的父親在冬天常常穿了滑雪鞋到樹林裏去打鹿。他並不就帶了他的鹿回來，到兩個星期以後，才駕馭着一隻馴鹿，載回了肉和皮革。最後的一次，他很困難的駕馭着，沒有停止過，但那隻馴鹿原來一隻不好的。疲勞得再不能在雪地裏走了，牠不肯吃乾草，也不肯讓自己被診察，牠開始用角去　觸父親。父親設法將一把小刀揷推牠的咽喉裏去，於是拖着脚回到家來。但是他病得很利害，誰都注意到了這個。這是很明白的，這隻鹿是他最後的了。</p>
<p>市鎭是在河流的下游，相隔有五百公里！這在西伯利亞是差不多不算什麽距雕的。父親同意了到醫院去。沙瓦卡的哥哥！普洛霍爾，結婚後巳有了兩個小孩！現在全家都　在他一個人身上了，他搜索的望一望沙瓦卡，又憂愁地望望他的父親，但是並沒有反對。於是沙瓦卡開始把他的來福槍弄乾凈，擦了油，準備了火藥和重彈，聽快了他的斧頭，收集了一切生火和捉魚所需要的物件。他放一些小米在一只袋裏，鹽放在另一只袋裏，又把鹽肉放在第三只袋裏。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一個「否」與三個「而後已」</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>調解意阿爭案的巴黎三國會議，雖然幾位外交家，聚精會神的討論了好多次，終於十八日，給意首相墨索里尼電話中的一個「否」字，把阻止東菲戰爭的企圖，完全打破，而以賴伐爾艾登阿洛錫三人署名的寥寥數行的公報，宣告壽終正寢。惟欲挽回戰禍的一綫希望將於九月四日的國聯行政會議，以作最後的努力。墨索里尼這一聲「否」字，其影響於世界大局的安危，至爲重大。</p>
<p>然墨索里尼這一聲「否」字，還是一種消極的表示。他在這個『否』字以外，尙有二個『而後已』，這種積極的語氣，才叫你看出他的决心。墨氏前日在伊塞尼亞向第二十三師團一萬二千人演說，其中有言曰：「吾人應向前勇進，至法西斯帝國成立而後已，余知君等必以鐵的紀律，各盡天職，至一切目的全達而後已』。至法西斯帝國成立而後已，至一切目的全達而後已，這二個「而後巳」，豈不比較前一個「否」字，還要厲害嗎？在這裏，墨索里尼的雄心，已表示的明明白白。現聞意國已决定於十月間攻入阿國，他日國聯行政會議縦有回天之力，恐亦難以挽救此一觸卽發得危機。</p>
<p>但阿國雖為弱小，究亦非可輕侮者，先日阿王向英報訪員發表談話，其中有一段云：『我國願生存於和平之中，吾人更熱切希望，意國與我國之間，不致發生戰爭，惟如實逼處此，大難臨頭，則為保障自由計，吾人自得準備抵抗，直至最後一人而後已」。這個「而後巳一，卽是阿國抗敵的决心。</p>
<p>意阿爭端的調解，現在旣因墨索里尼的一個「否」字，而陷於僵局。將來情勢的發展，意國必用二個「而後已」去征服阿國，而阿國亦必用一個「而後已」去抗禦意國。這是意阿相持中一種必然的結果。</p>
<h3>新秋偶記</h3>
<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>我想不出，在我這二十幾年的過程中，到底再有比十三歲到十六歲這三年秋天的快樂的時候不？</p>
<p>小時候因為體弱，受不起熱，所以在夏天，總是飯也不大吃，瘦得可憐概懨的好像在生什麼病，但一到秋天，我就像到秋風同來的秋鷹一樣，在晴得發脆的天空中，輕健地摩宕。</p>
<p>秋天在鄉下眞是成熟的季節：桃子，瓜，雖則已成强弩之末，但是纍纍的紫葡萄已經垂垂的成熟。我那時因為補償夏天的損失就各樣吃得很多，大人們也知道我可憐，只要我不太過份，總不來禁止。</p>
<p>那時我們還不留心什麼「立秋」之類的季節，同時也不以為舊曆的七月一日是秋的開始，我們那時秋天開始是七月七日。七月七日是「七夕，」姊妹們在那天大家興高采烈的染紅指甲，乞巧做花鞋，因為「七夕」是「女兒節，」所以一布全沒有我們男孩子的份兒，但是我那時我同樣高興着七夕的到來，因為七夕一到，不但天氣凉，同時從夏天一開始就望起的七月十五在「七夕」一過接着就來了。</p>
<p>七月十五是鬼節是中元，在我們鄕下自然也免不了打醮，所謂蘭盆勝會就是。</p>
<p>在上海看慣弄堂裏的打醮的人們，總以為我們鄕下的蘭盆會也不過如此罷；其實，這觀念是完全不對的。從七月初十那天起，我們鄕下的靑年們就動籌備着了做紙鬼，看地方，捐錢，請人，到十四那天，一條小船停在河旁，船裏</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>走出來的是一班打十番的人，接着又一條小船，船上走出來的是十二個道士，最後又是一條小船停下，十二個和尚漫漫地走了出來。這時候他們的住處早已決定的，三班人就各到住處去休息了一回，就大家集中附近的廟裏，（大槪就是和尚們的住遽大家打扮起來，一方面許多年青人也早已把他們做好的各種紙鬼旗旙拿了過來，待道士和尚打扮好就整隊出來，笙璈合奏，鐘鼓齊鳴，連道士們許多不知其明的法器也敲打起來，他們從廟中出發，在幾條比較大的路上走着好一回再向搭好的法壇走出。壇是兩隻，對面相向，和尚道士各据一壇，兩壇中間有一枝高約二丈的竹竿，上邊一幅招魂旙，竹竿的絕頂直掛下來，約莫有一丈三四尺長，到晚上那末這招魂旛就換了一連九盞的招魂燈。我那時候的行止，是完全跟和尚他們扶同的，從廟裏出發走幾條大道，然後到壇下。他們一上壇，就各自陳設整理起應用的東西來，那是一無可看，時間又在太陽落山之時，我就急急回到家裏，胡亂吃了夜飯，再跑到壇下去看。</p>
<p>約莫八點鐘的時候，法事開始了，和尚們是照例熟練的咒唸那梁王賓懺，同時更宣召各色鬼魂，施放飲食，而道士呢，就完全不同了，他們演着一劇劇的戲：什麼小鬼相打，什麼木蓮救母，什麼拾黃金之類，全有和尚唸得起勁，他們就做得起勁，自然這時候台下觀的眾全向了道士的壇，和尚只能對着觀眾的背唸經唸了，這連和尚自己也覺得乏味，就鐘鳴一聲，全班起立，觀眾們也就他們突然起立的時候，轉過身來，和尚們得此時機就不肯放過，由一個和尚「劈起鼓來，」所謂「劈鼓」就是由法器中的銅鼓，向空中拋去，從一片起到二片，最後到四片，和一個尚和的兩隻手輪流接着，據說這玩意很不容易，一不當心，不是落地，就是劈破手，雖則如此到底和尚們的玩意兒少，觀眾大部分時間是面向道士的。</p>
<h3>六鳥灣</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>船駛近六鳥灣，扮了半天的哭喪臉的天幕，終於拉破了烏暗的面皮，一陣拳頭大的兩點像開了閘的潮流一樣打下來，西南風更一陣緊似一陣，小船就那樣巔簸着，使水手們快惶急地忙亂起來。船老大一座石像似的站在船頭上，他用經驗的目光向天空打量着，一方面鎮靜地指揮水手，全船的生命財產完全是付托在他的命令之下了。船免強沿着岸綫前進，船老大終於發令停船，他說照這樣的情形今晚無論如何不能開到省城了，前面是六鳥灣，或許能早一點找到施捨飯館。那些焦急的旅客面面相覷着。他們大多是商人時間在他們的目光中是異常寶貴的；假如今晚船能到省城的話，於他們營業上的利益是不能估計的。現在船是在六鳥灣停泊下來了，天空的雨點發狂似的撤下來，河道中的浪濤同時狂旺起來，這不測的風雲，不知要延長多久時候，然而船老大是為全船的生命財產而吩咐停泊的；那末，這些旅客們只有緘默着，打算今夜的下落了。</p>
<p>船在六鳥灣碼頭停泊定當，備有雨具的客人都紛紛上岸了，想在天色沒有絕黑之前早些找到果腹及夜宿之地。我昏昏然混在他們隊裏，因為我是第一次走這條航路，一切情形都是我所不熟悉的。這艘航船在半路上停泊過夜後來我知道是時常有得發生，那些老出門的他們都知道某一個碼頭上那裏有飯店及旅舍。</p>
<p>雨打在雨傘上發出巨大的聲音，更加風勢緊急，我的下半身像剛從河裏拖起來似的淋着水，想把傘去擋住迎面的風吧，卻又恐迷住自己的眼睛，看不見前面的人使自己迷了路，而六鳥灣的街道是不平坦的石子路，堆積着水窪的地方，時常把自己的皮鞋完全浸在水裏。這裏又沒有電炬，那些街燈像燐火一樣，街燈的距離又是很長，在相當的距離中，即是走在我最前面的人也僅僅像一條黑影幌動着。但是我不敢開口，那些人都是默默地走着，轉過了幾條狹小的街，彷彿前面有雜亂的聲音，於是我抬起頭來，在距離我不多遠的地方懸着一盞巨大的燈籠，燭光中映出殷紅的「客寓」兩個大字。那時候就顧不到腳底下的水窪，加快步子趕上去，等我到客寓六打下傘來，才發現我背後還有不少人跟蹤着。</p>
<p>客寓是兼營飯館的，跨進門就是個很大的飯廳，在一盞昏黃的煤油燈下靜排着十來張飯桌，以我猜測起來，這客寓是為我們過路人專設的無疑了；後來一個小伙計吿訴我他們店裏的生意是完全沒有把握的，客船是難得停泊在六鳥灣的，衹有那些走旱路到省城的旅客們在這裏打尖，所以忙起來忙這末幾天，有時候卻幾個月做不到一筆生意。</p>
<p>這些不速之客闖進飯廳，相熟的小組就各自佔據了一桌，但是陌生的坐下去，大家也是歡迎的，這種熱情衹有在旅途中可以碰到，大家衹要互相點點頭，就長呀短的談起來，把他們預計着到達省城以後的什麼什麼，都忘了個乾淨。</p>
<p>那個小伙計突然忙亂起來，他似乎有些手足無措，從這張桌子到那張桌子，一邊打着哈吹，對於這一筆生意或許他們是沒有預料的吧。</p>
<p>十來張桌面上亂哄哄地，有些敲着桌子，有點拉着省城的口音喊伙計，那天大的雨完全被人們遺忘了。</p>
<h3>竹林新詠</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>在古書上我讀過竹林七寶，當時我幼稚的心靈上是多麼羨慕那種生活的恬淡，心境的閒適，那七位賢士的孤高純潔的人格，我是拿着誠摯的心去接觸的，膜拜的。</p>
<p>由於這，我對於我山後的竹園發生特有的興趣了。雖然現在想來，那是一種出世的，可笑的愚妄，然而在當時，所謂「山高水長」的賢人之風，確實在我腦板上刻下不可磨滅的跡痕。</p>
<p>我之受竹林，尤其當長長的夏日。將近中午，我便肩着一張竹床，揀着一塊濃蔭下睡覺了，山風拂過叢簇的竹葉，清脆的響聲沒入了平靜的波面，接着一支別動隊似的涼風，帶着幽香襲到身畔，連心上的俗塵也沖洗淨盡了。在那里，我仿佛眞實地接近了大自然的本體界，我聽見她的呼吸，我瞧見她的微笑，在每一片尖長的竹葉上，我發見她們不同的臉，在每一隻鳥兒的笑語中，我明瞭她們不同的需求，我便像把一顆心交給神明的人定的老僧似的交給自然了。我得了天地之眞氣，我有天地那般偉大，覺得古代那七位賢人，依然不過一流俗物罷了。</p>
<p>飢寒驅使我離開了故園十餘年，竹園的榮枯早在我關心之外了。前據父親來信說：因為水災，竹已變成飯吃了。啊，我明白了，有飯吃才能享受着清閒，才能做得成「山高水長」的陷士！</p>
<h3>先知？</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>午</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>由晨到暮，除卻一燈悄然萬般皆靜的深宵最富靜之趣味，就要算短短的午畫為値得讚美。午畫的韻致是安靜的，而沒有深宵的凄寂。安靜中帶着弛散明快的情味，又并不像響　晚的倦備和荒涼。天空，遊雲，樹蔭，蟬聲，以至雞的啼唱，都富於舒徐的睡意的蠱惑，叫人約不慳吝的放下繁逼的工作，求一短暫的安息，在深夜，工作疲憊了精神的時候，一支香煙，或者一杯咖啡，是能儘量去適應它的刺激性能的；午畫則例外了，煙的魅力反會幫助心情的靜止，悠悠然的把興奮的體力，思潮，在柔絲縹渺的煙影中，帶到恬適和睡意深厚的境界去，一切都覺渾然，人會忘了周遭的世界，一切足以使思潮緊張的人事；像托足於柔軟飄忽的雲堆，飄飄然的只有自我的存在。世界像跌入在夢的氛圍里。</p>
<p>為要好好捉住這短短午畫的情趣，我常常小心地抑制自己，不輕易讓精神弛散到頂點，安然睡去。這時候，我放開胸懷，丟下一切足以疲困身心的活動。睡床原靠近空前，躺在枕上，卽可望到窗外的一碧長空；鄰院的雞啼，又極容易把人帶到睡組長去。此外，一切都似乎懶散了，安靜了，一股美妙的松快之感包裹着陶醉着我的身心，情感復得到歸眞的境界，消除了對生活的一切忿悶。於是，安靜的心情重把思潮的關閘打開，許多微妙的眞理，舊事，美好的幻想，都像長空的白雲，那樣輕輕的帶着安神和平淡的聲容，打眼前浮過。假使人生眞有白日多夢，那它的境界就應當是這般的了。因為眞正的夢都不免多多少少帶上沉重的顏色和澀味的。</p>
<p>對於雲的愛好，我一向也沒有忽略過。這也只能在心閒神靜的時候。午畫的心情當然最合於看雲的境界。晌晚的雲，雖較為瑰麗，但多幻變、那只好讓小孩們去欣賞讚美。在舐賞過人生苦味，櫛沐過生活風霜的人們，似乎　多半要消失去好奇的情趣，而反會使情感岔到消極的鋒棱上去，若是為看雲而至大發其「白雲蒼狗」的悲涼悶悒之嘆，那是如何剎風景的事！當我靠在枕上，對着視野的是高遠的天空，蔚藍的底子上浮遊着一片片一絲絲的雲影，動而不迫，溫柔，皎潔，天眞，嫵媚；情調是空靈美妙，使人心地光明澄澈，而又婉約飄忽。漸漸的，蟬的吟唱雞的遠啼，也在耳邊隱隱的沉下去，沉下去……我終於在穿林渡水而來的午風的撫慰中睡下了。</p>

<p>值得紀念的：</p>
<p>電通新片「自由神」，是一部國民革命史實的簡叙，除在風俗和道具方面化了許多時間好心血，力求真實外，在戰中更有一二巧合與値紀念的事情：</p>
<p>（一）三年前吧，因某次上海戰爭的爆發，造成了許多無父母家室的孤兒，他們現在還是過着流離失所的生活，這就是現在虹口慈幼教養所的兒童們。「自由神」中戰區的被難兒童，恰巧就是請他們來担任的，他們久沒有了父母的愛情，也久沒有了天倫的快樂，他們雖小，也雖然知道這是在做戲，但明明是三年前親身經歷過的一幕呀，一羣天真的心，也都有點黯然了。</p>
<p>（二）中央航空學校掩護營的士兵們，有的是參加過北伐的，這次在「自由神」中請他們重演一次光榮的革命史蹟，他們還是和當年前綫一般的勇敢，流着血，拚着頭顱，雖是做戲，在精神上他們還是萬分的興奮。</p>
<p>周伯勳</p>
<p>周伯勳在銀幕上活躍着多年了，他飾的角色，以買辦階級演得最體貼，土豪劣紳也做得很適當，不過他在演完「桃李刦」後，電通的導演們勸他改邪入正，在作風上做一個「好好先生」，現在行將公映的電通新片「自由神」，在幾度試映後，許多人看了都異口同聲地說，周伯勳變了，而且變得更老練了。觀眾們，這是他改變作風後的第一聲，究竟怎樣，在最近你們可在金城和他見面了。</p>

<p>「自由神」攝影師楊霽明，卡爾登照相館主人，瘦俏幹練，作事謹嚴，虛心，肯耐苦，肯努力，他的英日文攝影書籍曁刊物極多，平日除在書本中探討趣味外，常以照相機作玩具，做各科遊嬉，故全部精力，可說完全消耗在攝影方面，自擔任司徒慧敏導演的「自由神」攝影師後，生活方面，雖忙碌異常，但以數年來理論與經驗，得此實踐機會，使他尤感興奮，據他說，在死的書本，呆板的鏡箱以外，這次又多看到許多活動的資料，「自由神」雖是他第一次的嘗試，經他攝影場上細心地研究，苦心地策劃，把燈光，角度和地位，都達到完善的地步，這一位困苦奮　中的開麥拉新人，在「自由神」的成功，已展現了他的無窮的希望。</p>

Following unanimous deliberation, it was resolved that President Wang should continue to be responsible for the positions of President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Financial Issues of Today</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The evolution of the market often proceeds from development to expansion, then to panic, followed by contraction, stagnation, improvement, and a return to prosperity. The so-called waxing and waning, the alternation of adversity and prosperity, are all natural and cyclical phenomena. Following a series of incidents in Shanghai's banking and financial sectors, the recent turmoil has gradually subsided. Those who were unable to sustain themselves were naturally eliminated, while those who survived have become more cautious and conservative. There will be no problems for the September accounting period. As for the liquidation of the closed banks, apart from the American Bank, there has been little significant progress. However, the government's supervision of the banking and financial sectors has indeed been steadily progressing. Issuing banks are still nominally independent, but in reality, centralization and unification are within easy reach. In the past, government-run banks often sought commercial shares to strengthen their credit. Now, commercial banks such as China Industrial, China General Commerce, and Siming are reportedly going to incorporate government shares. There are also talks of consolidating various savings societies under the Central Trust Bureau. Unified currency issuance, centralized operations, and then efforts to reorganize the currency system and adjust the national financial system, within a few years, can be expected to get on track and move forward.</p>
<p>At the time of currency reform, there are many complicated issues. The abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan has been implemented for many years. In the interior, it is still difficult to completely eradicate the old system. The currency system in Sichuan Province is extremely chaotic. But there are also many places that are not as bad as Sichuan Province and are still not unified. It is easy to reorganize the currency system in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas because they are relatively unified. It is difficult to reorganize the currency system nationwide because it is messy and diverse. But if you want to reorganize, you can't avoid the difficult and pursue the easy. It is necessary to wait until all can be reformed before its effect can be seen. Those who do not understand currency reorganization often have unnecessary worries, but they don't realize that currency reorganization is something that must be done. A unified country should have a unified currency system. As for whether the currency can exert its effect, the quality of the coins is very important. But the key lies in whether the issuance has a sound organization and whether the maintenance has strong credibility. When copper coins were minted in the late Qing Dynasty, it was stipulated that 100 copper coins could be exchanged for one silver yuan. But now it can be exchanged for 340 coins because it could not maintain its credibility. So the price is determined according to the copper content of the coins. Therefore, no matter how the currency system is reformed, credit is the most important thing. If the handling is not appropriate, would it be just chasing away the sparrows?</p>
<p>The time has come for our financial industry to determine its direction. American silver senators seem to be gradually realizing this. They have dispatched representatives to investigate the situation of silver in Europe, Asia, and South America in order to establish a new silver law in the future. There is also talk of restoring the New York silver market. This means that the US silver policy will eventually change. Currently, they are unlikely to take any active action. If we can avoid being limited by temporary gains and losses and take advantage of the opportunity when British and American representatives come to China one after another, thinking from the perspective of the entire national economy and making a concerted effort to establish a century-long plan, then today's difficulties and hardships are enough to temper the spirit of revival of our financial industry.</p>
<h3>The Yellow Waters in the South Have Been Diverted into Lake Luoma; the Floodwaters of the Jing River Have Reached Maocun</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Due to the breach of the western dike of Lake Weishan, the water level on the 22nd was 36.007 meters, and the southward flow is increasingly rapid, inundating Yaosu. The yellow waters have been diverted into Lake Luoma, so the middle and lower reaches of the Grand Canal have not been significantly affected. However, the Liutang River is still rising sharply. The Jinjiakou culvert is being built here to prevent the Liutang River from flowing into the Grand Canal. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level at the Chedaokou in Tongshan is rising rapidly, and the area north of the mouth is a vast expanse of water. The new dike on Mount Pipa extends to Wangzhuang, south of the Jingshan Bridge on the east side of the Jinpu Railway, with a total length of 30 li. The west side of the road has been completed, and the east side is under construction. The seven-section dikes from Yue Mapo, Zhengji, Liuxinzhuang to the north of Jiuli Mountain, with a total length of 70 li, have also been mostly completed. Shao Hanyuan, together with engineers Yu Shufang and Xue Zhankui, inspected the old Yellow River north dike and the Chedaokou Dam this morning and comforted the soldiers and workers building the dike. It is said that with the construction of the dikes, the disaster area is expected to be reduced. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qin Jieren, the magistrate of Pi County, telegraphed Xuzhou on the 22nd, stating that there was heavy rain in Pi County last night, with 2 decimeters of water accumulating on the ground. The water level of the Bulao River is gradually becoming dangerous. The south dike in the Tongshan-Pi County border section is particularly dangerous and is being urgently reinforced by the villagers. It was found that the water from the upper reaches of the Bulao River in Tongshan County, which flows into Pi County, overflowed. It flowed downstream along the river, and the surge was very strong. The dikes on the middle of the Grand Canal are very worrying. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to Jinpu Railway news, the Jing River has overflowed to the north bank, and the water has reached Maocun Station. There is no impact on transportation. It was found that the Jing River crosses the roadbed south of Maocun Station. A new dike has been built on the south bank, so the water overflows to the north. The road authorities have opened a culvert to discharge the water. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, chief engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, inspected the water situation in Lake Weishan on the 19th and returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd. According to him, this breach occurred north of Zhanggu Mountain, overflowing into various places in Tongshan. North-south embankments are currently being built to avoid expanding the disaster area. The lake water exceeds the lake mouth by 30 centimeters, and the function of the gate has been lost. The southward water is quite turbulent. The terrain in Pi County is relatively low, and the water level of the middle Grand Canal is close to the embankment, which seems more serious. The water flow in the upper reaches of the Bulao River overflows and is several li wide. The Economic Commission is now blocking the Dongzhuangkou gate. Xu is scheduled to inspect the inner Grand Canal, middle Grand Canal, Suqian, and other places on the 27th. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Water Level Rises in the South Grand Canal; Water Levels in Various Sections Reach Full Capacity</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level in the South Grand Canal has risen to 20 meters, only 2 inches away from the highest water level of 18 meters. All sections of 1, 2, and 3 have reached full capacity and are extremely dangerous. Wuciao in Jing County, Zhangjiacun in Dongguang County, and Liaojia Dike are all in great danger. Thousands of people in Dongguang County and Jing County are working together to reinforce the dikes. All ships have been suspended. Li Shufan, the magistrate of Jing County, telegraphed the River Bureau on the 20th, requesting prompt allocation of funds and materials for dike reinforcement. The person in charge of the River Bureau said that the original funds for flood prevention and emergency rescue in the South Grand Canal were 15,000 yuan. Only 6,000 yuan have been received so far. In addition to purchasing 14,000 sacks, the funds for lead wire, wooden stakes, and other materials have been exhausted. An application has been submitted to the province for allocation. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Shandong Telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Requesting that the Ministry of Railways Add a Surcharge to Fund Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>Zhang Yantian Visits Shang Zhen to Request Instructions on Bandit Suppression Measures: Mounted Bandits from Shixia Flee West of Gubeikou</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yantian, the commander of the 2nd Hebei Security Brigade, came to Tianjin to visit Shang Zhen and request instructions on bandit suppression in the Zunhua-Qian'an area. He is scheduled to return to his post on the 23rd. He stated that since the green corn season began, the local militias in Zunhua and Qian'an have been weak, leading to a surge in banditry. Taipingzhai was once captured by bandits, resulting in a loss of over 100,000 yuan. The militia's firearms were also seized. After a fierce attack by his brigade, the bandits fled. Among the bandit leaders, Li Laobao's group alone had over 2,000 members. The bandits outside the pass are mostly local ruffians without any organization, a mere rabble. They flee as soon as they encounter the security brigade. Currently, besides notifying the local militias in the Ji-Mi area to intercept a portion of them, the others are scattered in the Lijialve area or fleeing out of Xifengkou. In recent weeks, they have not been as rampant as before. His brigade has specially dispatched a battalion commander to conduct guerrilla warfare within the Luanyu area. This method is better than static defense, as it does not allow the bandits to rest and makes it difficult for them to regroup. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Textile Industry Report: Advocating an Agreement with Japan to Limit the Import of Japanese Cotton Textiles</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today submitted the report of the Cabinet's Special Committee on the Textile Industry to Congress. The report recommends that the United States seek to establish a friendship agreement with Japan to limit the quantity of Japanese cotton textiles imported into the United States and continue to levy business taxes on cotton textiles at current price disparities. The president has rejected the industry's proposed method of subsidizing the textile industry, as other countries may take retaliatory measures as a result. The President mentioned that Japan has much discussion on the United States' intention to retain an important part of the Philippine market, but the President believes that the most important condition for the export industry is world currency stability and the reduction of trade barriers. The report was signed by Commerce Secretary Roper, Secretary of State Hull, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, and Labor Secretary Perkins. (21st Kuomintang Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Meeting Lasts Five Hours: Discussion of the Overall Situation Completed: All Twenty-Two Cabinet Members Attended with Solemn Expressions, and the Crowd Was Silent</h3>
<p>(London) An emergency cabinet meeting began at 10:00 AM this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street to consider the Abyssinian question. A large number of police officers were in the streets to suppress the crowd. The Lord Privy Seal, MacDonald, arrived first and, at the request of a large group of photographers, stood on the steps of the Prime Minister's residence for photographs. He then smiled, waved his cane to the crowd, and entered. The other cabinet members then arrived in succession, with solemn expressions. Each stopped for photographers to take pictures. The crowd remained silent throughout, without any cheers. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Baldwin, with all twenty-two cabinet members in attendance. The discussion focused on the following:</p>
<p>(1) Exploring the overall situation, with particular emphasis on Mussolini's rejection of the Anglo-French proposal for a peaceful resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p>(2) Considering the policy that the government should take at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on September 4th.</p>
<p>(3) Studying the government's decision to prohibit the issuance of licenses for all munitions to Italy or Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Although the meeting lasted a long time, the crowd gathered on Downing Street gradually increased in the afternoon, all waiting for the cabinet members to leave. The police constantly moved them to prevent traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The morning session lasted three hours, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM for lunch. The meeting resumed at 2:30 PM and adjourned at 4:30 PM. When leaving the Prime Minister's residence, the Minister for Dominion Affairs, Thomas, told the crowd, "We have now completed our discussion." The cabinet members will probably resume their holiday activities tomorrow. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Affairs Committee Suggests: Strictly Abiding by the League of Nations Covenant: The London Times Expresses This Frankly</h3>
<p>(London) At today's emergency cabinet meeting, the Foreign Affairs Committee will suggest that Britain should strictly abide by the obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. This is said to be the result of the committee's thorough discussion of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute last night, and it has been decided that if the League of Nations Executive Council agrees to impose sanctions on Italy, then Britain should use this as the final way to deal with the overall situation. It is now believed that if the British government holds this attitude, France will also tend to sympathize. The committee listened to a report by Eden, a member of the cabinet without portfolio, on the proceedings of the Paris two-nation meeting, and after Foreign Secretary Hoare expressed his views on the issue, it made this firm assertion.</p>
<p>An emergency cabinet meeting was held at 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Prime Minister Baldwin. In addition to Hoare and Eden, those present were the Lord Privy Seal MacDonald, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Home Secretary Simon.</p>
<p>Today's emergency cabinet meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM this morning. This is unusual, which shows that the discussion will last for a long time or may take a full day. It is believed that the meeting will not discuss the detailed items of British policy, but will determine the general outline. It is said that the cabinet has differing opinions on the imposition of sanctions on Italy, with those who advocate sanctions believing that this move will not cause serious consequences. Other cabinet members believe that Britain should focus on limiting the war to Africa. Since the political crisis in 1931, when several cabinet members left MacDonald, MacDonald has formed a government united throughout the country. Downing Street has not been as active in August as it was yesterday. The crowds standing outside the Prime Minister's residence to see the comings and goings of cabinet members and other major politicians were numerous, and there were many photographers and representatives of British and foreign newspapers gathered at the door.</p>
<p>It is said that the agenda for the cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee discussion of today's cabinet meeting is divided into three items:</p>
<p>(1) Eden's report on the proceedings of the Paris three-nation meeting.</p>
<p>(2) The attitude that the British government should take in Geneva.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of munitions shipments to Italy and Abyssinia.</p>
<p>It is said that Foreign Secretary Hoare's talks with the Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian High Commissioners and the representative of the South African Free State yesterday were all exploratory in nature, asking them to inquire about their governments' opinions on certain points. It is rumored that when Hoare met with the American chargé d'affaires Atherton, he asked the United States to change its attitude. Those responsible pointed out that this statement is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Hoare and Eden today met with leaders of various political parties and veteran politicians such as Churchill to inform them of the general direction of the policies that the British government will pursue as a result of today's cabinet meeting. This kind of conversation is innovative in nature and also proves that the government has no intention of convening Parliament before October 29. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Times said in an editorial today that if the League of Nations Executive Council decides on or after September 4th that Italy has committed an act of aggression, then the British government and people must address the issue of what sanctions they are prepared to implement. The Italian-Abyssinian affair involves many issues. Some people are now advocating a policy of non-intervention, but the nation's conscience has been moved, and the League of Nations must show that it is not afraid of Mussolini. If Britain takes the lead and puts forward concrete measures in Geneva, then the League of Nations can make this expression. The nature of the sanctions is not an event to be decided immediately, but the sooner the countries consider this matter, the more effective it will be when implemented. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Neutrality Act; Britain Has Not Invited Invocation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the Neutrality Act, which has now been sent to the House. The Act contains the following four provisions: (1) Prohibition of American transport of munitions to all belligerent nations; (2) Prohibition of foreign submarines using American ports as a base; (3) American merchants and citizens who travel on ships of belligerent nations shall bear their own risk; and (4) Munitions manufacturers must register with the government. During the Senate's debate on the bill, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, stated, "Although the Kellogg-Briand Pact is not as good as the League of Nations Covenant, and does not prescribe sanctions, we need not adopt such measures. I do not favor interfering in the affairs of other nations in any way." Former Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Borah, stated that at present, no measures can stop Mussolini. Senator Hiram Johnson stated that Britain and Italy are both focused on the minerals and water resources of Abyssinia, so the United States should not favor any European nation. The American people should not forget the war debts that have yet to be repaid. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, as usual, met with reporters today. At that time, he stated that to his knowledge, Britain has not invited the United States to invoke the Kellogg Pact in order to jointly deal with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States is actively pursuing legislation to maintain American neutrality in future wars. Last night, President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee McReynolds met. It is reported that President Roosevelt and others all agreed that the congressional legislation should allow the President to decide when to prohibit arms exports, and whether this prohibition should only be applied to aggressor nations, or to all belligerent nations. President Roosevelt and the Foreign Affairs Committee both oppose the Senate-passed bill that would force the President to declare an arms embargo when other countries go to war. It is expected that there may be a compromise on this matter, on one hand allowing the President to make decisions regarding the embargo, and on the other hand stipulating that the embargo must be applied to all belligerent nations. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a London dispatch received by Le Matin, the American Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Atherton, declared to British Foreign Secretary Hoare on behalf of his government that President Roosevelt has decided not to get involved in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The report also stated that Washington sources confirmed that the United States does not intend to solicit opinions from any country regarding the potential impact of the Italo-Ethiopian war. Le Echo de Paris also published the same report. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia today carried an article by Gayda entitled "Italy and Britain: Not Conflict, but Cooperation." The tone is very different from his recent publications. It states that there is no widespread anti-British sentiment in Italy, and that the policy of Fascist Italy always aims for sincere and active cooperation. This cooperation originates in Europe and should extend to all parts of the world, including Africa. According to sources, Gayda has always been the mouthpiece of the Italian government, and this sudden change in tone is believed to be due to the spirit of unity expressed by the British government and part of the British press.

<h3>Abyssinia Decides on General Mobilization; Preparing to Resubmit Proposals</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's correspondent in Addis Ababa reported today that after a meeting with tribal chiefs and advisors, the Abyssinian Emperor has decided to issue a general mobilization order. However, there has been no official confirmation of this news. If it is true, it shows that the Abyssinian Emperor sees the failure of the Paris conference as an indication that war is unavoidable. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian Emperor recently gave an interview to a reporter from the London Daily Telegraph, saying, "If the League of Nations fails and war between Italy and Abyssinia breaks out, our greatest difficulty will be the lack of necessary munitions. A war between Italy and Abyssinia will drag other countries into the vortex, just as in 1914. I cannot help but be saddened by this. If the League of Nations is weak and incapable, most countries in the world will be plunged back into the situation of 1914, and the so-called security guarantees will be lost forever. However, I still believe that the League of Nations will do its utmost to avoid the outbreak of war." The Abyssinian Emperor continued, "Recently, the Italian press has claimed that Abyssinia has begun attacking Italian troops. I deeply regret this 'fabricated battle.'" He also stated that Abyssinia is prepared to resubmit proposals, requesting the League of Nations to send an impartial commission to investigate the truth of the dispute, "in order to demonstrate our frank and clear confidence." He concluded, "If all efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution fail, then the victory of the Abyssinian army in the Battle of Adowa in 1896 will surely be repeated today. I can say this with certainty." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Tensions High in East Africa; Gloomy Stock Market; Hong Kong Dollar Also Affected by Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>(London) American institutions and exchanges today are eagerly awaiting news from the British Cabinet meeting. The atmosphere in the stock market is gloomy, and prices of various stocks are falling. Prices in the commodity market are mostly rising. Wheat, cotton, corn, sorghum, and metals are all experiencing price increases due to war fears.

<h3>The Comintern: Past and Present; No Longer Talks About "World Revolution"; Willing to Cooperate with Capitalist Countries</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Seventh Congress of the Comintern has just concluded, with proceedings being very calm, characterized by organization and a lack of spontaneity. Previously, when Trotsky was in power, the Comintern often used world revolution as a slogan. This time, the slogan is to resist pan-fascism and imperialism, which is different from previous congresses. From now on, although world revolution is the ultimate goal of the Comintern, it is considered to be distant and not achievable in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Comintern's adopted strategies are also quite flexible, in order to adapt to the current situation. In short, the Comintern has now become a bulwark of Soviet Russia, used to resist external forces and protect the achievements of socialism in Soviet Russia. As for the strategies to be adopted in the future, the Comintern has now acknowledged cooperation with capitalist countries, and even advocated alliances with "any country," as long as this country advocates peace. Soviet Russia assumes the role of protector of peace. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Reports of Bombay Silver Market Closure Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Bombay. The rumor circulating in Shanghai that the Bombay silver market has closed is unfounded.

<h3>Death of the First President of Greece</h3>
<p>Athens. Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, the first President of Greece, passed away here today. Kountouriotis was born in 1855 into a noble family, and was now the oldest figure in Greek politics. During the European War, he joined Venizelos and General Danglis in resisting the Athens government. As a result, Greece was declared to have joined the Allied Powers by his comrades and fought against Germany and Austria. Kountouriotis later became Minister of the Army, and in 1919, when King Alexander died of poisoning from a monkey bite, Kountouriotis became Regent. In 1920, the election resulted in the return of King Constantine. In 1923, after Constantine passed away, former King George returned to the country, but faced strong opposition. He was then forced to leave the country, and Kountouriotis again served as Regent. On March 15, 1924, the 103rd anniversary of Greek independence, the Republic was declared, and Kountouriotis was elected interim President, and then formal President, until he resigned in 1926. In August of that year, after Pangalos' dictatorship failed, Kountouriotis was re-elected President, until he resigned due to illness in December 1929. Since then, he has lived quietly in the countryside. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Naval Conference Policy to be Notified to British Government</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government delivered a note on the 11th of this month, hoping to convene a naval conference in October of this year. The Japanese government believes that it is necessary to express its position regarding the British government's attitude at this time. An agreed-upon plan has now been reached. On the 21st, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the contents of the plan at a Cabinet meeting and requested understanding. On the 22nd, at noon, he instructed Acting Ambassador Fujii to notify the British government of the key points of the Japanese government's arms reduction policy. The contents of the instructions are roughly as follows: (1) The Japanese government's fundamental policy on arms reduction has already been declared during the preliminary negotiations last autumn, which is to achieve a fair and appropriate new arms reduction that is "insufficient for offense but sufficient for defense," to establish a common maximum limit for all countries, and to demand substantive equality. (2) However, if the establishment of a common maximum limit is recognized by the major powers, then even a self-determined shipbuilding declaration is a form of construction plan within the common maximum limit, and the Japanese side believes that there should be room for further consideration. (3) Regarding the issue of individual qualitative restrictions, the Japanese government adheres to the principle of establishing quantitative restrictions, that is, a common maximum limit, as the top priority. It believes that there is no objection to still insisting on first determining the quantity, and then discussing the quality. (4) The above are the fundamental principles of the Japanese government. If they are recognized, it will gladly participate in the conference. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

(2) When providing education at military schools, it is necessary to strive for the thorough implementation of spiritual education. After the meeting, Army Minister Hayashi told reporters that he had frankly exchanged opinions with Araki on matters within the Ministry. Although this informal discussion had no impact on the instructions given at the division commanders' conference, it could be used as a reference for establishing future policies.

<p>Over 150,000 Disaster Victims, Over a Thousand Deaths</p>
<p>A Jinan correspondent reports that after the breach of the Yellow River at Linpu, the disaster victims are dying and displaced, and the situation is extremely dire. According to those who risked their lives to inspect the disaster areas, it is unbearable to describe. It is said that in the past, Yellow River breaches have always occurred on the north side of the levee, on the people's levees. The current breach occurred on the Jin levee, which had never breached before, so the residents south of the levee were completely unprepared and caught off guard, resulting in the most severe impact. According to the disaster victims nearby, people did not believe it even an hour before the breach. Once they knew the water was coming, it was too late to escape. Within an hour, the water rose five or six feet, and within two hours, all the houses had collapsed. Some people were washed away while escaping, and others were drowned on rooftops when the roofs collapsed. The most tragic case was in Yanglou, where a large cart fully loaded with refugees was submerged halfway. Only the heads of the two oxen and one donkey were visible. They were unable to move forward. The people standing on the cart cried out for help, but in less than twenty minutes, both people and animals were dead and disappeared. In Zhao Zhuang, an old man carried his young son of ten years or so. Halfway through the escape, the water reached his neck. The old man sadly told his son that he could not take care of him and was going to abandon him. The son cried loudly and refused. When the water reached the corners of his mouth, he forcibly threw his son into the water, grabbed a small tree, and escaped with his life. Wang, a disaster victim from Zheng Ying, said that he witnessed more than a hundred corpses being washed past the north gate of Zheng Ying in a single day. Corpses are often found in the sorghum fields. According to current information, in Linpu town alone, no fewer than two hundred people have died, and the number of missing persons is unknown. The total number of deaths in all areas is over a thousand. The tragedy is so great. The breach occurred around 8:00 PM. Most of the people escaped to the levee or climbed onto the roofs or trees, and they were gradually rescued to the levee by boat the next day. Heaven is unkind, and misfortune never comes singly. It has been raining heavily for days. Disaster victims are huddled together along the Jin levee for dozens of miles, hungry and soaked by the rain. Some have not had food for three days. The sound of weeping is unbearable. Currently, most of them are still on the levee, or under makeshift shelters, or huddled under the roots of trees, except for a few who have sought refuge with relatives and friends. Food is an even bigger problem. Houses have collapsed and food supplies are cut off. Hiring a boat to salvage food yields only a斗 and 8升, and most of it is rotten and sprouting. Half of it has to be given to the boatman. Rotten wheat and moldy beans are exposed along the levee, with a foul odor. After they are used up, they will starve. For example, to the west of the breach, in a section of two or three 里, nine people starved to death within five days. If relief efforts are not made quickly, who knows how many more will starve to death. In short, Juan Cheng was the hardest hit by the breach, suffering the greatest losses. A total of over 6,000 hectares of land were flooded, over 700 villages were submerged, and there were over 150,000 disaster victims. It is confirmed that over 1,000 people have died. There is no time to count livestock and furniture. It is truly an unprecedented tragedy.</p>

<h3>Hubei Provincial Committee Inspects Jianghan Disaster Area - Cheng and Li Report After Returning to Province</h3>
<p>A Hankou correspondent reports that the Hubei Provincial Government, recognizing the severe flooding in the upper reaches of the Jianghan area, organized an inspection delegation to investigate the situation. Its mission was to慰問comfort the disaster victims,散發distribute emergency relief, 調査investigate the disaster situation, and履勘survey the levee projects. They divided into two groups, one for the Yangtze River and one for the Xiang River. The Yangtze River group was led by Cheng Qibao, director of the Department of Education, and the Xiang River group was led by Li Shucheng, a member of the provincial committee. Both have completed their missions and returned to the province. Cheng and Li reported on the details of the inspection to the provincial government yesterday, as recorded below:</p>
<p>Cheng Qibao reported that this time, traveling upstream along the Yangtze River, they passed through Jiayu, Jianli, Shishou, Gong'an, Jiangling, Songzi, Yidu, Yichang, and other counties. Due to the rising water levels, the gunboat they were on could travel everywhere. The entire journey took sixteen days. The mission of the inspection delegation was approximately four points: (1) To soothe and comfort the disaster victims; (2) To distribute emergency relief; (3) To investigate the disaster situation; (4) To survey the levee projects. Regarding the soothing and comforting aspect, the people of each county had suddenly suffered a tragic calamity. It was necessary for the government to send personnel to comfort them. This time, representing the provincial government and the disaster relief headquarters to comfort the disaster-stricken counties had a significant impact and allowed discussions with local governments on various relief issues to jointly plan for the best possible solution. Order in the disaster areas gradually stabilized. Regarding the distribution of relief, due to the limited amount of relief funds carried, they could only be allocated according to the severity of the disaster. Although each county and Shashi town received relief funds, it was merely a drop in the bucket. However, the government should be responsible for relief matters, and local governments should also find their own solutions to cooperate effectively. In reality, except for Shashi and Yichang, where some local fundraising occurred, the remaining counties mostly relied on the government. Households in better circumstances could not assist the disaster victims. The public's sense of civic duty was extremely weak. Regarding the investigation of the disaster situation, although various reports and materials were collected on the number of farmlands lost and the number of deaths, the accuracy and reliability of the figures, and whether there was any scientific basis, remained questionable. Based on the inspection results, although there were slight differences compared to reports in the newspapers, the death toll and farmland losses in the heavily affected counties exceeded the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic. It is estimated that the population deaths in each county numbered in the thousands, the flooded fields amounted to five million acres, and the property losses amounted to one hundred million yuan, far exceeding those of the past. The cause of this disaster was mostly due to mountain torrents, carrying sediment and stones downstream, causing severe siltation of farmlands, which greatly impacted cultivation. Comparatively, Shishou and Jiangling suffered the most severe disasters, while the severity varied in other counties. Regarding the levee projects, they were considered extremely serious. This flood was mostly caused by flash floods. In Yichang, excessive rainfall occurred on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of last month, causing severe flooding. The Jingjiang main levee was breached in a short period of time. Wherever the water passed, the houses were washed flat. The river changed course, and the landscape was altered, with a higher water level than in the 20th year of the Republic. Many levees along the river were breached. The main levees that were once considered impossible to breach have now been breached. This was due to the failure to carry out repairs in ordinary times. It cannot be said that human effort was not exhausted, but the levee system was not unified, and management was not thorough. Disputes between people's levees and main levees were often heard. People were also constantly competing with the water for land, resulting in nowhere for the floodwaters to drain. The cause of all these years of flooding can be traced back to this. Furthermore, due to inconvenient transportation and the excessive length of the levees, the news of a breach in one place did not reach another in time, leading to missed opportunities for repair. Furthermore, the people's wisdom was immature. Once faced with a flood, they secretly dug weirs and embankments to divert water, leading to repeated disputes. These issues should be studied to seek improvement. Now that most of the disaster victims have dispersed, emergency relief is no longer necessary. Work relief, agricultural relief, and epidemic prevention are urgent issues. Winter flood prevention and security are also crucial. Qibao inspected the counties the year before last, and this time he inspected them after the tragic flood, which has had an impact on the progress of local politics. Personally, he felt that the local people had no adequate preparation before the disaster. Once a disaster occurred, they were immediately in a panic. The local customs were also very bad. Gambling, opium, and prostitution were prevalent everywhere. In the future, he would do his best to correct these issues to make amends.</p>
<p>Li Shucheng reported that this time, inspecting the disaster area from Hanyang to Xiangyang, they passed through nine counties. The county was divided into seven districts. The fifth and sixth districts were completely washed away, and 80-90% of the first and second districts were submerged. The remaining three districts were less affected. The disaster area accounted for 70% of the county. Property losses were very large. The cause of the disaster was the water from the breaches of the 3rd-4th and 11th levees in the upper reaches, which rushed down, breaching many dikes and embankments. The main levees on both sides of the river from Hankou to X溝were almost completely destroyed, with countless breaches. The people hoped for emergency relief, agricultural relief, and work relief to urgently build embankments, and requested to close a river channel from X溝to Baiquan駐龍崗, so that the Han River would split into the淪 River, entering the River at岑家磯to alleviate the water flow. (2) Hanchuan: The county was divided into six districts. Except for small parts of the first, second, and third districts, all the other districts were submerged. The county seat was also under water. The submerged area accounted for 90% of the county. Countless houses and property were lost, and there were also casualties. The cause of the disaster was the water from the breaches of the 3rd-4th and 11th levees, and the flood from Hankou rushed straight down. The鄖 River also flooded simultaneously, and the river water backed up, so the disaster area was the largest. Located at the end of the drainage system, there was no hope for autumn harvest. The people's primary hope was for emergency relief, followed by agricultural relief and work relief. (3) Tianmen: The county was divided into eight districts. The eighth district, near Jingzhong, was the most severely damaged. The 1st, 2nd, and 5th districts were less affected. Only the highlands of the 3rd, 6th, and 7th districts were not submerged. The disaster area accounted for 80% of the county. Many property and houses were lost, and many people drowned. All construction projects were destroyed. The county seat was under water, with the battlements submerged. The cause of the disaster was the water from the breaches of the 3rd-4th and 11th levees, and the water from the Anhui main levee in the Shuang River south of the county flooded almost the entire county. The water in the west of the county had receded, and if there was no re-flooding, there was hope for an autumn harvest. The people urgently hoped to repair the breaches, subsidize the cost of the people's levees, and borrow seeds and draft cattle to carry out work relief to save the present situation. (4) Mianyang: The hinterland of the county was affected by the water spreading from the East Jing River, and the south was affected by the breach of the Changjiang麻布拐, so the disaster area was also large. (5) Qianjiang: The county was divided into five districts. The fifth district, bordering Kun 連and Zhongxiang, was severely damaged by the water from the 3rd-4th levee breach, which rushed south from the Yuxin River and Yonglong River. The second district crossed the East Jing River, and the breach of Wangjia剅 in the upper reaches caused a disaster, flooding the entire district. The rest were either affected or suffered from waterlogging. The disaster area accounted for 50% of the county. The people requested to repair the Wangjia剅 breach to protect the autumn harvest. The harvest of the five counties of Jing, Jiang, Liu, Mian, and Qian, which are related to the Dongjing River basin, would be over 10 million yuan. However, the local government was unable to raise funds and was willing to hire labor at half price to accomplish this. The total cost of labor and materials was 30,000 yuan. Please allocate and borrow this amount from the subsidy for people's levees to start work in advance. (6) Jingshan: The county was divided into seven districts. The fourth and fifth districts, adjacent to Zhongxiang, were hit by the water from the 3rd-4th and 10th levees, which rushed straight down like a high-rise building. The towns of Shangyang港, Yangjia, Yonglong River, etc., belonging to the two districts, were particularly severely damaged. It was difficult to calculate the loss of population, property, houses, and livestock. Other districts were also affected, but most of them were mountainous, with much less fertile land. Therefore, the area of land affected by water was not large, but it accounted for 40% of the county in terms of farmland. The replanted autumn millet was flooded twice. When the flood first occurred, hungry people plundered everywhere for food. Now it was calm. The people urgently requested to build the Zhongxiang breach to provide work relief and accommodate these people to avoid trouble. (7) Jingmen: The Mal 良鈸of the tenth district of the county bordered the Han River. The黃瓦幹堤under the district's jurisdiction was submerged, flooding the entire district. Fortunately, there was a mountain range to protect it. Except for the seventh and ninth districts of昆連, which were slightly affected, the rest were not affected. The seedlings along the way were flourishing, which was the only peaceful scene the delegation had seen since setting off. However, those not affected were indifferent to the relief of the disaster area. (8) Zhongxiang: The county was divided into ten districts. The second district was completely affected, the fourth district was not affected, and a part of each of the remaining eight districts was affected. The area accounted for 60% of the county. From the first levee starting from the county seat to Sikou, within a distance of 135 里, there were a total of thirteen breaches. The 3rd-4th levee breach was 4 kilometers long, the 11th levee breach was 800 meters long, and the rest were 30-50 meters long. At the breaches, the ground was scoured into troughs, and the backflow was silted up. Even if the water dried up, it would be difficult to cultivate. In addition, mountain torrents and the Xiang River flooded at the same time. Some villages and towns were completely destroyed, so the number of drownings was also higher than in the downstream areas. In the city, 300 buildings in the River Street collapsed. The situation elsewhere can be imagined. The breaches in each levee in the county were of great importance, and the counties requested that they be repaired in advance. (9) Yicheng: The county was divided into five districts. The first and third districts were submerged by the Xiang River, and the second district was submerged by the Man River. They were the most seriously affected, and there were also many deaths. The fourth and fifth districts were less affected. The disaster area accounted for 60% of the county. The county was located on a high plateau, and the water receded quickly. However, there was a shortage of draft cattle and seeds. It was hoped that the government would loan 30,000-40,000 yuan to help the poor farmers resume farming, and subsidize the levee fee for the Xiang levee so that it could be repaired as soon as possible. (10) Xiangyang: The county was divided into ten districts. Each district was partially affected, and the submerged area accounted for 50% of the county. The county was known as a mountainous area and rarely suffered from floods. This year, torrential rain fell, and the Xiang River, Tang River, Bai River,滾River, Chun River, and Qing River all flooded simultaneously. The water level was high, measuring in丈. The old Dragon levee attached to the city, and the Zheng Gong levee in Fancheng, were submerged, causing heavy losses to people and livestock. Fancheng was a prosperous commercial port on the Xiang River. The entire精华of the town was swept away. Fortunately, the inner city of Xiangyang was protected by the city walls, so the administrative area was preserved. (11) Gucheng and Guanghua: The delegation inspected Xiangfan and stayed for three days. The old河口motor road was washed away by the water. The Xiang River was rapid, and it was difficult to travel by boat. The delegation was also eager to return to the province to report on the disaster so that it could plan for the aftermath. Therefore, it did not go to the two counties for inspection. It was heard that Gucheng was also severely affected, and Guanghua was slightly affected. In summary, the counties mentioned above all suffered tragically. However, after detailed comparison, Zhongxiang, Yicheng, and Xiangyang in the upper reaches were the most severely affected, and Hanchuan and Tianmen in the lower reaches were the most severely affected. The water in the upper reaches flowed rapidly and had a strong scouring force, resulting in more deaths. However, the water receded quickly, and autumn harvest was possible in the highlands, so the hope for emergency relief was greater. The downstream areas were flat, the disaster area was larger, and the water receded more slowly, making it difficult to recover the autumn harvest, so the hope for emergency relief was greater. As for requests for urgent construction of the levee breaches, work relief, overall flood control, and dredging of rivers, the counties all unanimously agreed, etc. (20th)</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Inspection at Dongzhuang: The Disaster Victims Gathered on the Dike of Henan and Shandong Provinces; Materials Were Lacking, Making Closing the Breach Difficult</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Lanfeng: Due to the breach at Dongzhuang in Shandong Province, the disaster situation is extremely severe. Yesterday, this reporter accompanied Mr. Xu Shiying and Mr. Fang Juehui on an inspection. We departed from the travel agency's reception at 8:15 AM, along with over twenty people including Supervisor Wang Hongxian of the Supervisory Committee, Provincial Committee Member Chang Zhizhen, Xu's secretary Hu Zhongshu, his son Gongshi, Fang's secretary Wang Yunpu, and Director Lu Hanquan of the 20th Route Office. Under the guidance of Wang Youlong of the Industrial and Economic Reconstruction Group, we rode in five cars, leaving the North Gate and heading east along the dike to Liuyuan Kou. Lush willow trees lined both sides, and crops grew vibrantly. After more than forty li, the willow trees gradually thinned. Passing Sanyizhai, we drove along the Kaicao highway for about thirty li to Simingtang in Kaocheng. Continuing along the dike, we reached the site where the flood of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933) breached Kaocheng. Currently, the people's embankment is being heightened and thickened, with willow branches woven to protect the shore. Earth mounds are erected on the embankment for emergency needs. As the dike slopes down, it becomes narrower, and the protection work is extremely poor. It is no wonder that from the first year of the Republic (1912) until now, the breach has occurred fourteen times at Dongzhuang, between Lanfeng and Dongzhuang. Passing Xiezhai, we entered the territory of Hebei Province, and at noon we ate lunch at the water accumulated south of the dike in Nanyiduan, which was caused by the breach at Fanzhuang in the twelfth year of the Republic (1923). Within ten or more li from the main flow, the floodwaters were vast. More than eighty villages under the jurisdiction of this section have been submerged. They have not yielded a harvest for four years, and three-fifths of the residents have fled to other places, while the rest gather on the dike, exposed to the elements. The situation is the same as we moved east. The water flows along the dike, eroding it into a channel, which the locals call the "Lin River." At Gaocun in Nansanduan, it finally rejoins the main flow. Straw huts line the dike densely, and disaster victims gather there. Their clothes are tattered, their feet are bare, and their bodies are exposed. Autumn is already deep, and soon they will cry from the cold. Because the river water has scoured the banks, more than ten villages, including Leng Han, Daliuzhuang, and Luzhai, have had their houses demolished and their belongings moved onto the dike. Adding to this, there are thin coffins without dry earth to bury them, and corpses are laid out in straw mats, a truly tragic scene. Although Wutun, Haitou, Huozhai, Yuhuangmiao, and Lai Zhuang are located south of the dike, they are inundated with several feet of rain accumulation, making the autumn harvest hopeless. The Dalianzhuang dike at the top of the main flow is in a precarious situation, and hundreds of civilians are working hard to protect it. Arriving at the Zhukou dangerous work site in Shandong Province, a long section of about one li is piled with check materials, stones, green bricks, and mountains, and the protection is quite thorough. We arrived at Dongzhuang at 3 PM. Li Wenqi, Zhang Lianjia, Sun Zerang, and others welcomed Xu and Fang to the first section's office. Then, we inspected the breach. Disaster victims kneeled on the ground, crying out for relief, their plaintive voices, "You are all officials, give us some money," never ceased. Currently, the first, second, third, and fourth breach openings are heavily silted, but the fifth and sixth openings have merged into one, over three li wide and two-four zhang deep, taking away nine-tenths of the entire river. It has submerged seventeen counties including Yuncheng, Heze, Juye, Dongping, Jiaxiang, Wenshang, Jinxiang, Yutai, and Jining, spanning two hundred and fifty li wide and three hundred li long. Jucheng is the hardest hit, with seven-tenths of its entire territory submerged. Although the levee of 1,572 zhang long has been heightened and thickened, a dangerous situation has already occurred in the southern section. It is feared that there will be a need to retreat to the people's dike between Xinghuayuan and Duzhuang. If it breaches again, it will all become a swamp. Fanxian, Shouchang, and Yanggu will also be submerged. There are about 170,000 disaster victims in Jucheng, and only over 31,000 people are being sheltered in Putian, Gulin Temple, Hongchuankou, Gezhuang, and Dongkou. Most still have no means of support. Although the dike-closing meeting on the eighteenth has made decisions on finance, transportation, and technology, at least 20,000 cubic meters of stone are needed. Even if the Lanfeng Dongbatou light railway is fully paved and all ships are requisitioned for transport, it will still take until March next spring to transport everything. Currently, there are no materials at all, and the problem of closing the breach is still far away. We returned west at 5:30 PM. The car traveled faster at night, but the road was bumpy. Xu's car, leading the way, almost overturned down the dike thirty li from Kaifeng. The leader had his left eye injured, and Xu injured his lip. Everyone traveling together was worried about this old man. We returned to Bianyuan around midnight. (The twentieth)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Chasing Thieves, Injured, Falling into the Water, Drowning</h3>
<p>Zhang Changyun, a farmer in the ninth household of the eighth Jia of the sixth Bao of the West Protective Dike in Punnan, was diligent and thrifty, and had accumulated some savings. However, on the twenty-first night, around 11 PM, more than ten thieves broke down the front door and entered, ransacking the place. The thieves carried the loot out the door and left leisurely. The victim followed and chased after them, and was struck in the left leg by the thieves. Despite the pain, he continued to chase, but he lost his footing and fell into the river and died. Now, the deceased's son, Xian'gen, has inventoried the lost items, prepared a list of losses, and forwarded it to the Ninth Police Station to report to the county bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Committee Members from the Provincial Government Come to Songjiang to Inspect the Water Police</h3>
<p>The various teams of the First District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Corps are stationed in various counties such as Song, Feng, Jin, Shang, and Nan. The district chief of the district, Zhang Jingqing, arrived in Songjiang at 9 AM today and accompanied the committee members from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to inspect the various sub-teams. The sub-team leader stationed in this city, Hu Tu, obeyed the order to assemble the team and waited for the inspection. After the inspection, the committee members, still accompanied by District Chief Zhang, went to Chuanlai Temple and Tinglin to inspect.</p>
<h3>Re-Branding Self-Defense Firearms</h3>
<p>When the county organized the Baojia system, it notified the registration and branding of self-defense firearms for inspection. Previously, the county government sent Ye Zhouyin to various districts to brand the firearms, which has already been completed. Subsequently, requests were made to re-brand those who had registered but not been branded. County Magistrate Jin approved the request and dispatched Ye Zhouyin to the First District Office on the 23rd, the Second District on the 25th, the Third District on the 27th, the Fourth District on the 29th, the Fifth District on the 31st, the Sixth District on September 2nd, the Seventh District on the 4th, and the Eighth District on the 6th. All district offices have been instructed to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Dispute over Price Reduction in the Bathing Industry</h3>
<p>There are more than fifty bathhouses in Suzhou. Recently, Tianyi Pool Bathhouse on Banma Road, due to the drop in prices of various goods and reduced costs, intended to reduce the bathing price by 20% to ease the burden on bathers. However, this was met with dissatisfaction from other businesses. The industry association held a general meeting yesterday morning to discuss the matter. Under the chairmanship of Ju Zengxin, the members expressed that with the rising prices of foreign goods, they were suffering great losses, and therefore not only could they not reduce prices, but they all wanted to increase prices uniformly. Although representatives from the county party headquarters and the county government tried to persuade them, it was ineffective. The meeting ended without any resolution, and this matter is likely to cause disputes.</p>
<h3>Wujiang Parricide Case Appealed, Judgment Announced</h3>
<p>Shen Xiaofang, the son of Shen Hongli, a villager in Pingwang Township, Wujiang, was 35 years old and did not engage in proper work, and was unusually fierce. His parents hated him to the bone. His father, Hongli, together with his wife, Wu, gathered a crowd and plotted to kill Xiaofang, burying him in the wilderness. After the incident was exposed, the Wujiang County Government detained Shen Hongli and Shen Wu. Each was sentenced to seven years of penal servitude. Shen Hongli and his wife did not accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. The judgment was announced yesterday, reducing the sentence to five years of penal servitude.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Six People Electrocuted, Two Died Tragically</h3>
<p>Yu Jugen, a 24-year-old villager from Xizhang Township, District Ten, County, had a modest family fortune. Recently, Jugen purchased a radio receiver in the city. At 8 AM yesterday, he was installing it at home. However, he accidentally touched the power line with the antenna. Jugen was suddenly electrocuted and collapsed to the ground unconscious. His sister, Guixian, saw this and stepped forward to pull Jugen away, but she was also electrocuted. Subsequently, a neighbor, Ding Heshang, stepped forward to pull Guixian away, but he was also affected by the electric current. At the same time, the son of another neighbor, Mao Aju, Xiyuan, who was only seven years old, saw this and also grabbed Ding Heshang, causing the electric current to pass to Xiyuan's body. He collapsed and could not move. Later, the family managed to save the four people. Jugen, Guixian, and Heshang were all able to transmit the electric current through their bodies, and they did not die. They were immediately taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Xiyuan had already died on the spot. Yesterday, the Tujheng came to the city to report to the court for an autopsy. In addition, Tuo Dexin, a 16-year-old apprentice at the Yihai Printing House under the Tuiguan Arch in the city, went to the stove room around 10 PM the night before to turn on the light. However, the switch leaked electricity, and he was electrocuted and collapsed on the spot. He died after ineffective treatment. Also, Zhang Zidao, an employee of the Cheguan Office of the Dagong Silk Factory in Beimen, accidentally touched the power line while hanging clothes yesterday afternoon. He was rescued after treatment.</p>
<h3>Bailiff Detained for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Yang Bokang, a former bailiff of the local court, collected ten yuan from Guo Aju, a villager in Nando Wajiuli, in May of this year when he executed the foreclosure of the debtor's house in the case of Fang Xiaoming. The money was entrusted to him to be delivered to the plaintiff, Fang Xiaoming. However, Yang did not deliver the money to Fang. The case was exposed yesterday. The court president, Cui, sent a letter to the prosecutor's office. After the prosecutor, Ren, held a court hearing, he detained Yang for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>The Zhenxin Cotton Mill Experiences Another Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The Zhenxin Cotton Mill outside Ximen experienced a labor strike last month. Through the earnest mediation of the Party, government, and the county Chamber of Commerce, and with the continued assistance of the Shanghai Bank, the strike was quelled. However, the manager, Jiang Zeqing, suddenly claimed illness and resigned, and then went to Shanghai for treatment. Although the mill's board of directors convened an emergency meeting to discuss solutions, they found no good way to resolve the situation due to the high cost of cotton and the low price of yarn, and the declining market. The mill then resumed work on the 17th to fulfill the intentions of the Party, government, and various parties. Five days have passed, but the cotton reserves are running out. Starting today (the 23rd), work will be suspended again. Fearing that there would be no hope of resuming work in the future, the workers went to the homes of the mill director, Mi Yingkui, and the deputy mill director, Mr. Yang, and forced them to the mill, placing them under surveillance. They stationed people at all important entrances and exits within the mill, declaring that the regulations for distributing rewards for work should be followed as before. All workers who did not have missed days of work should receive bonuses. They then demanded that the official date of resumption of work be determined first. Finally, they said that all the fines deducted by the mill in the past two years should be returned. The situation was extremely serious. At the time, a trainee was severely beaten due to verbal conflict. The mill reported to the Fourth Public Security Bureau, which sent police to suppress the situation. The county Party headquarters also sent civil movement cadres Tang Pu'an and You Wenhua to earnestly persuade the workers, and the situation was temporarily defused. However, a fundamental solution has not yet been reached.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee Inspects Lakeside Reclaimed Fields</h3>
<p>In order to urgently understand the actual situation of the fields along Taihu Lake in Wuxi, the provincial government specially sent inspector Gu Qiao Ruo to Wuxi to discuss inspection methods with County Magistrate Wang Bao Xuan and Construction Bureau Chief Zhang Dezai, and to inspect various files related to the lakeside fields. Yesterday, they chartered a motorboat, accompanied by County Magistrate Wang, Construction Bureau technician Xu Chuanlie, and district chiefs Yu Nui and Zhu of the third and fourth districts, to conduct a detailed inspection of various places in the lake. They brought maps and registers to record each item. It is expected that they will return to the province tomorrow to report.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Provincial Journalists' Organization</h3>
<p>The local Journalists' Association held its second meeting of the second session yesterday. The members present were Shi Qinglin, Zhang Suichu, Wu Guan_, Zhang Rongliang, Wang Jiejun, Hu Xisen, Zhou Xinru, Xu Xiyin Chen Hongjun, and Ji Xilin, totaling over thirty people. Sun Dexian was the chairman, and Yuan Hegao was the recorder. The items discussed included: (1) It was resolved to appoint Sun Dexian, Sun Xiangfeng, Wu Guanchun, Hua Jinji, Xu Chizi, Yang Chusun, and Shi Qinglin as members to be in charge of organizing the preparatory work for establishing a provincial journalists' organization, forming a joint committee to be responsible for the preparation. (2) Legislator Wu Jingxiong expressed his opinions on amending the publication law in the newspapers. The association should explain to Mr. Wu and request his sympathy and assistance in reconsidering and amending the publication law.</p>
<h3>Mingguang: Various Organizations Telegraph to Retain County Magistrate Ma</h3>
<p>The county magistrate of this county, Ma Qingting, has now been ordered by the province to be transferred to Hefei. Upon hearing the news, various organizations believe that Ma has been in office for three years, suppressed banditry, and stabilized the countryside, and they are unwilling to let him leave his position. They have telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the transfer be canceled.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Bandit from Sheng County Executed in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Ma Jinhuan, a bandit from Sheng County, had repeatedly committed crimes of kidnapping, extortion, murder, arson, and other cases in the county. The Sheng County Government had presented to the provincial government and county authorities to purchase and arrest the bandit.

<h3>The Case of Cross-Boundary Road Construction and Telephone Price Increases: The Municipal Government Conferred with the Telephone Company Yesterday; Our Side Strongly Defended Sovereignty, but No Results Yet</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, regarding the issue of telephone price increases in the area of cross-boundary road construction, the Municipal Government previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company stating that if it wanted to increase prices in the area, it must first obtain the consent of the Municipal Government. In order to determine this issue of sovereignty and resolve the case of telephone price increases in the cross-boundary road construction area, the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company held a continued discussion at 2 PM yesterday at the Maple Forest Bridge Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. The attendees from the Municipal Government were Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang and Chief Chen Zonghan of the Third Section. The attendees from the Shanghai Telephone Company were Vice President and General Manager Porter C.W., Chinese Vice President Tan Weixue, Deputy General Manager Fritchman, and Administration Department Chief Longhurst C.D., totaling four people. The location was in the conference room of the Maple Forest Bridge Municipal Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<p>No Concrete Results Were Discussed: The discussion began at 2:20 PM. Mr. Xu Peihuang stated the Municipal Government's position on the Shanghai Telephone Company's proposed price increase in the cross-boundary road area, expressing that the Municipal Government should have sovereignty. That is, when the Shanghai Telephone Company wants to increase prices in the cross-boundary area, it should first seek the consent of the Municipal Government. Mr. Xu also cited the provisions of the temporary contract for cross-boundary telephones previously signed by the Ministry of Communications, the Municipal Government, and the Telephone Company, which only granted the company the right to operate in the area. Therefore, the ultimate sovereignty should belong to the Municipal Government. Then, representatives from the Telephone Company explained the reasons for the planned price increase. Regarding the point of recognizing our sovereignty, they only said that the price increase was within the scope of the company's business policy and did not provide a definite and satisfactory answer, nor did they provide any reasonable explanation. As a result, there were no concrete results from the discussion. However, yesterday's conference was of the nature of an exchange of opinions, so both sides ended the conference at 3:35 PM.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty: After the conference, a person in charge of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau told a reporter from Shen Shi News Agency that yesterday's meeting with representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company regarding the cross-boundary telephone price increase case was an informal negotiation. As a result of the discussion, there was no definite expression on the point of sovereignty raised by our side, but no reasonable explanation was given. Therefore, other issues were not discussed. However, this case should not be delayed for too long. The Municipal Government and the Telephone Company share this feeling. Therefore, in the shortest possible time, we should seek an appropriate way to resolve it. The Municipal Government has already made concrete decisions on this case, but the details have not yet been announced. In short, the Municipal Government is determined to uphold the principle of safeguarding our sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Telephone Expert Committee Decides on Investigation Steps: To Contribute Concretely Within Two Months</h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, in order to improve the telephone business in this port, the Public Concession Bureau has specially hired experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan to form a telephone expert committee to thoroughly discuss everything. According to the reporter's inquiry yesterday, the committee began working after its establishment. The first step was to inspect the equipment of the Telephone Company's various stations and study whether they meet the principles of science and economics. This work is about to come to an end. The second step is to investigate the Telephone Company's facilities, accounting, and profit and loss status, which is expected to be completed in three weeks. Then, based on the investigation, and referring to the excellent systems of various countries, we will adopt the advantages and make concrete contributions for the authorities of the Public Concession Bureau to adopt as the basis for improvement. The entire work is estimated to take two months. Currently, committee members Hu Ruixiang, Brown Lei, Inada, Lei, and others hold meetings every afternoon when necessary to collect and discuss the investigation results.</p>
<p>According to Zi Lin News, the four telephone experts hired by the Public Concession Bureau began a secret meeting yesterday (the 21st). Even the secretary was not allowed to participate. The meeting was probably to discuss the basic guidelines for the investigation. In the next two weeks, the experts will confer with the Shanghai Telephone Company's authorities, so no news is expected to come out. It is expected that at least three weeks will be needed to formulate a plan, or it may still be a preliminary opinion.</p>
<p>According to Continental News, the Telephone Problem Investigation Committee will issue its resolutions only after the experts have submitted their official reports. It is expected to be delayed until the experts pack their bags and return home.</p>
<h3>Various Banks in This City Underwrite Disaster Relief Loans: Jointly Form Syndicate to Negotiate Contracts with Flood Relief Association; China, Communications, and Central Banks to sign separate contract for 300,000 Yuan; Xu Shiying to Return to Shanghai Within Days After Inspecting the Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces, in order to handle emergency relief, specially delegated Mayor Wu, Chen Guangfu, Lu Bohong, and others to contact the banking industry for a loan of 500,000 yuan, which has yielded considerable results. Various banks are actively participating in the loan and will sign a contract within days to disburse the funds for use. Xu Shiying has completed his inspection of the Yellow River disaster and will return to Shanghai by ship from Beijing within days. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Various Banks Eagerly Participating in Loans</p>
<p>According to the Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, Lin Kanghou, after the association received a letter from the Flood Relief Association and representatives contacted them for a loan of 200,000 yuan, it was submitted to the Standing Committee for resolution, approving the introduction and sending letters to various member banks for loans, limited to two types: 10,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Each bank chose to participate on their own. In recent days, most of the banks have replied to the association, all eagerly participating in the loan. These 200,000 yuan will have no problem. The Flood Relief Association sent a draft loan contract on the 20th, but the Bankers' Association is only in the position of introduction. The banks will form a syndicate, delegate representatives, and negotiate a contract with the Flood Relief Association. It is expected to be established in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Three Banks Have Already Decided</p>
<p>As for the loan of 300,000 yuan from the Central, China, and Communications Banks, after the association's representatives, Mayor Wu, Chen Guangfu, Lu Bohong, and others contacted them, the three banks have accepted and have informally conferred on the allocation of numbers for each bank. It has been roughly allocated. Once Central Bank President Kong returns to Shanghai to discuss with China Bank Chairman Song Ziwen and Communications Bank General Manager Tang Shoumin to decide, the three banks will directly sign a separate contract with the Flood Relief Association to disburse the funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Will Return to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Disaster Relief Committee and Vice President of the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces, departed from Shanghai at the beginning of this month to inspect the flood situation in the Yellow River basin in Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces.

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Mortgage Loans Can Be Handled According to Usual Practices of Banks and Money Shops; Negotiate Directly with Firms Without Waiting for Separate Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee has modified the procedures for small credit loans and extended the repayment period, which has been praised by all sectors. As for mortgage loans, they will be handled according to the usual practices of banks. With the September deadline approaching, various factories and firms have already been directly negotiating separately. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Regulations Stipulated After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Loan Committee, urging it to formulate regulations for reviewing mortgage loans (the original letter has appeared in the newspapers in recent days), the Loan Committee replied yesterday, stating: "Regarding your esteemed chamber's letter No. 581, stating that with the end of September approaching, most industrial and commercial entities rely on mortgage loans for capital turnover and requesting prompt formulation of regulations for reviewing mortgage loans to be reported to the ministry for implementation, we approve this. Upon investigation, the 15 million yuan industrial and commercial mortgage loan should be lent by banks and money shops themselves, according to the Ministry of Finance's instructions and the detailed rules of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan, but it must be reported to this committee for review. The National Treasury Certificate will then be issued as a second guarantee for the loan. The procedures for handling this are already stipulated in the detailed rules of the loan. Factories and firms applying for loans can directly negotiate with banks and money shops for loans according to the usual mortgage loan procedures. The banks and money shops will then submit the application to this committee for review according to the regulations in the detailed rules of the loan. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to formulate separate review regulations for the implementation of this matter. We hereby reply to your letter, hoping that you will investigate and inform all trade associations." Addressed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Cai Zengji.</p>
<p>Direct Negotiation After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received the Loan Review Committee's reply yesterday, it immediately notified all members to instruct applicant factories and firms to negotiate directly with banks and money shops according to the Ministry of Finance's order and the detailed rules of the loan, and to handle it according to the usual procedures of banks and money shops. However, the lending bank or money shop must submit the application to the Loan Review Committee for review in order to issue the National Treasury Certificate as a second guarantee.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Met with Reporters at the Bank of China This Afternoon; Reported on the Work of the Economic Commission and Bank Affairs</h3>

He then transferred to his own car and returned to his temporary residence on the eighth floor of the Jianghai Customs to rest. He then went to the Ten-Nation Bank to work at around 10 a.m. Song is scheduled to meet with reporters from various newspapers at the Bank of China at 11 a.m. today to report on the recent work of the Economic Commission and the Bank of China.</p>
<h3>Domestic Manufacturers Met Yesterday to Prepare for the New Wharf National Exhibition; Overseas Chinese Representative Wang Shuyang Attended and Reported</h3>
<p>In order to promote the sale of domestic goods in the Singapore market and to attract the attention of natives in the Nanyang region to Chinese goods, the Singapore Chinese are planning to hold a Singapore National Products Expansion Exhibition on October 5 this year in Singapore. The Singapore General Chamber of Commerce had previously sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance in contacting domestic manufacturers to participate. All Shanghai manufacturers held a joint meeting of manufacturer representatives at the International Trade Bureau conference room at 5 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from the Family Industry Cooperative, Du Bingshou, Huasheng Electric Factory, Yuan Jiayao, Yaguang Manufacturing Factory, Zhang Huikang, Wu Yousheng, Guangming Factory, Liang Zhensheng, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Dai Zhicheng, China First Knitting Factory, Cai Yinchang, China Wool Weaving Factory, Jin Yiming, etc. were present. First, Wang Shuyang, the Shanghai representative of the Singapore National Products Expansion Exhibition, reported on the significance of expanding national products in Singapore and the recent situation of national product sales in the Nanyang market. He stated that since last November, representatives had been sent back to China to contact manufacturers in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places for the Singapore National Products Expansion Exhibition. In February of this year, a preparatory office was officially established. The Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will provide food and lodging for domestic participating manufacturers. The exhibition venue will be inside the Great World Amusement Park in Singapore, which is magnificent in scale and beautifully equipped. The reason why the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce must hold this exhibition is to revive the market for Chinese goods in the Nanyang region. Because Singapore is the commercial center of the Nanyang Islands, all imported goods are wholesale in Singapore. Therefore, the holding of the Singapore National Products Expansion Exhibition has profound implications. Finally, Representative Wang expressed his gratitude to the manufacturers present and stated that future representatives should be factory officials in charge or experienced personnel, because when promoting the sale of domestic goods in the Nanyang market, it is possible to investigate the inner layers of the Nanyang market and conduct research for the promotion of domestic goods. Then, the manufacturers began to discuss the participation methods, including transporting and displaying goods, bringing goods to sell, and sending personnel to sell and investigate. The display goods will be handed over to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for transportation. Representatives from each manufacturer will depart on September 15.</p>
<h3>Tan Xihong Explains: Zhejiang Province Notifies the Collection of Cocoons; Silk Factory Association Schedules Another Meeting</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to exempt the autumn cocoon from control due to the fear of a shortage of raw materials in Shanghai, Tan Xihong, Acting Chairman of the Sericulture Control Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou. At 11 a.m. yesterday, he met with Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, to explain Zhejiang Province's control over the collection of cocoons. Shen Huachen stated the factories' opinions on exempting the collection of cocoons from control. It is heard that the conclusion was satisfactory. The Silk Factory Industry Association will hold a general meeting of members in the coming days. A reporter from the Dongsheng News Agency met with Tan Xihong at the Shanghai Office of the Sericulture Improvement Association on Avenue Albert the day before yesterday. A translated version of his remarks is published as follows: The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, in view of the disastrous defeat of the silk industry in recent years, followed the central government's lead and used political power to control sericulture and help the revival of sericulture. After several years of effort, the achievements have been (1) all seeds produced by various seed farms are purchased by the government, so that various farms can operate with peace of mind; (2) farmers purchase silkworm eggs according to government regulations, which not only ensures the use of excellent varieties but also keeps prices low, eliminating the abuse of seed dealers monopolizing the market; (3) since the government has controlled the cocoon market, the cocoon price is calculated by the government according to the silk market, so that farmers and manufacturers do not suffer losses. As a result, cocoon prices are uniform and orderly, and the silk produced in China can stand on the world market; (4) regarding silk factories, the government selects silk factories with excellent results, provides them with raw materials, controls their technology, and standardizes their products, so as to improve quality and reduce costs, and establish a model for other ordinary silk factories to promote China's silk manufacturing industry; (5) regarding sales, a sales organization has been established in Shanghai to manage sales matters, so that Chinese products can be active in the world. In short, the government is taking a unified position in all aspects of the sericulture industry, taking care of all aspects, so that all parts of the sericulture industry can be promoted evenly, and seeking the overall development of the silk industry. The current business is not long in progress, and it is far from success. Therefore, the government will continue to work hard to achieve perfection, and will never abandon it halfway. Moreover, the current world economic trend is extremely complex. If there is no government control and guidance, and merchants act freely, it will be difficult to survive, and the economy of the entire country will be affected. This is not a blessing for the country. Therefore, the government cannot abandon the capital of control. The government's control over sericulture does not necessarily require it to collect cocoons itself. However, last autumn, the price of silk fell drastically, and no one cared about the autumn cocoons. The government saw the need for it and had to come forward to collect cocoons in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers. However, afterwards, a part of the dried cocoons was sold to various silk factories in Zhejiang. In the spring of this year, the silk market was still weak, but the cocoon harvest was abundant. For the purpose of regulation, the government also collected a part of the spring cocoons. However, of the 300,000 dans of fresh cocoons produced in Zhejiang Province in the spring, the government collected 60,000 dans, only about 20%. In this period, Zhejiang Province issued a total of 410,000 sheets of eggs, and it is estimated that 24,000 dans of dried cocoons can be harvested. The government plans to collect 10,000 dans of dried cocoons, and the remaining 14,000 dans will be collected by merchants. However, the qualifications for collecting cocoons are still limited to (1) silk factories in Zhejiang Province, (2) silk factories in other provinces, (3) cocoon merchants in Zhejiang Province, and (4) cocoon merchants in other provinces, as in previous years. As for the dried cocoons collected by the government, in order to maintain the raw materials of the current silk reeling factories, it is hoped that the silk reeling factories will have a rational combination, organize joint silk factories, jointly collect cocoons, jointly operate, jointly sell, and be responsible for their own profits and losses. In the future, the government only needs to stand in a supervisory position and assist in the promotion of the business, and does not need to collect cocoons itself. In addition, in this period, the government will collect a part of the cocoons, and the silk factories will be responsible for the collection procedures. A part of the cocoons will be collected by merchants after registration and approval. There are no restrictions on the area. In this period, Zhejiang issued 410,000 sheets of eggs, and Jiangsu issued more than 600,000 sheets. The total of the two is 2 million sheets. It is estimated that 60,000 dans of dried cocoons can be harvested, but the Zhejiang government only collects 10,000 dans, which is to provide raw materials for the excellent silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is a necessary plan to subsidize the sericulture industry.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Organize the China Industrial Corporation to Return to China to Engage in Reclamation and Mining</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Overseas Chinese in Malaya, Nanyang, are very concerned about the construction of the motherland.

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Works Hard to Instill Commercial Common Sense; Stamp Tax Law Lecture Will Be Held Tomorrow; Special Lectures on Various Industries Will Be Set Up in Commercial Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is working very hard to instill general commercial common sense in accordance with the resolutions of this year's representative meeting. Now that the new Stamp Tax Law is about to be implemented, shops often do not understand the differences between the new and old tax rates. Therefore, a public lecture will be held, and special lectures on various industries will be set up in commercial schools. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Lectures on the Stamp Tax Law The Stamp Tax Law will be implemented on September 1. Many of the items stipulated in the law are different from the old ones. For example, some items that should have been stamped according to the old regulations may be exempt from stamping according to the new law, and some items that were exempt from stamping according to the old regulations may be stamped according to the new law. There are also cases where the old rate is higher than the new rate, and cases where the new rate is higher than the old rate. It is necessary to study and compare them in detail to avoid errors. In order to make the general merchants understand, the Chamber of Commerce has specifically scheduled a public lecture in the conference hall at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 24th). Yan Esheng, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce and director of the Commercial Monthly, will be the speaker. He will compare the new and old tax rates and explain them one by one. It will take about one hour. The special issue of the Chamber of Commerce Commercial Monthly on the new Stamp Tax Law is also being rushed to print. It will be published around the 24th of this month. It explains all stamp tax issues in the most detailed way. Each copy sells for 30 cents. You must go directly to the Chamber of Commerce to buy it. There is no hawking outside.</p>
<p>Explanation of Stamping Receipts The Chamber of Commerce consulted the Osmanthus Ball Industry Association to inquire about the methods of stamping receipts, invoices, and account statements. The Chamber of Commerce immediately gave detailed instructions, saying: (1) The three items of invoice, receipt, and account statement should be stamped up to a maximum of 3 cents. There is no saying that 200 yuan should be stamped 6 cents and 1,000 yuan should be stamped 30 cents. In the tax rate table in Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, all progressive stamps are set at 2 cents per 100 yuan or 2 cents per 1,000 yuan. If it only says that 3 cents should be stamped for every 100 yuan or more, it means that it should be stamped up to 3 cents and no more. By comparing the texts of items 1, 2, and 3 with items 14 to 26 of the tax rate table, the meaning is clear. The explanation in Article 13 of the detailed rules refers specifically to the above two words, which include the number itself, and cannot be interpreted as progressive. (2) New books used from September 1 should of course be stamped 20 cents. The rest should wait until the New Year and follow the new regulations. There is no need to add stamps at this time.</p>
<p>Holding Lectures on Various Industries The Chamber of Commerce Commercial School is holding lectures on various industries in order to help students understand the actual situation of various industries. The Chamber of Commerce has decided to invite leaders from various industries to give lectures once a week. Those who have been scheduled include Zhang Naiqi to talk about the banking industry, Li Wenjie to talk about the trust industry, Zheng Zenan to talk about the enamel industry, Ke Ganchen to talk about the cotton cloth industry, Xu Xiaochu to talk about the new medicine industry, Liu Shimu to talk about the Nanyang business, Luo Qinghua to talk about the silk industry, Chen Ziyi to talk about the miscellaneous grain industry, Feng Liutang to talk about the sales situation of foreign rice, Jin Runxiang to talk about the paper industry, and Xu Yongzuo to talk about the exchange industry. The school's third recruitment examination is scheduled for the 25th of this month, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Visited Zhang Jingjiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Li Shizeng and Dean Wang entered Beijing together on the evening of the 20th to attend the Central Political Council on the morning of the 21st and met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After staying in Beijing for one day, he left Beijing by car that night and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 a.m. yesterday. He got off the car and returned to his residence at the World Society on Ferguson Road to rest. Then, at around 9 a.m., he drove to visit Central Committee Member Zhang Jingjiang at his private residence on Massenet Road and had a long conversation until noon before leaving.</p>
<h3>The Insurance Association Asks for a Reduction in the Stamp Tax Rate; The New and Old Tax Rates Are Several Times Higher; They Separately Submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Legislative Yuan to Request Reconsideration</h3>
<p>The Insurance Association convened a general meeting of members yesterday because the new stamp tax requires insurance policies to be stamped according to the amount insured, at a rate of 2 cents per 1,000 yuan, and any amount exceeding 1,000 yuan will also be counted as 1,000 yuan. All members agreed that the new stamp tax law not only does not distinguish between personal insurance and property insurance of insurance legal persons, but also calculates the stamp tax rate of property insurance. Whether it is water or fire insurance, it is several times higher than the current provisional regulations on stamp tax. It is difficult to bear the burden. Moreover, the currently prevailing provisional regulations on stamp tax were negotiated and determined by the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau and the industry before they were promulgated. At that time, the business habits and various special circumstances of the industry were taken into consideration. Therefore, after several consultations, the bureau submitted it to the ministry for approval and ordered all provinces to comply with it. Now, suddenly changing it will only increase the country's tax revenue to a limited extent, but it will have many adverse effects on the industry. It was decided to submit it separately to the Ministry of Finance and the Legislative Yuan, requesting approval for reconsideration, in order to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants.</p>
<h3>The Capital Railway Ferry Yangtze River Ferry Enters the Dock for Inspection; Service Will Be Suspended from the 25th; Service Will Resume from September 1</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Ferry of the Capital Railway Ferry has reached the period for entering the dock for inspection. It is now ordered by the Ministry of Railways to sail to Shanghai on August 25 to be sent to the dock for inspection and repair. It is expected to be completed in seven days and will resume normal operation from September 1. During the suspension of the Capital Railway Ferry, temporary methods for connecting passengers and goods across the river will be temporarily determined. Passengers and luggage traveling across the river on the Shanghai-Ping Train will be transferred to the Chengping Ferry. Passengers traveling north from the Beijing-Shanghai Station to the Pukou Wharf on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and passengers traveling south from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to the Beijing-Shanghai Station will be transferred by car. Then, they will board the Shanghai-Ping Train at Xiaguan and Pukou respectively and go directly to Pinghu. As for less-than-carload and full-carload freight traveling across the river, the railway will prepare other boats for round-trip lighterage. All passenger and freight transportation will be charged as before, without additional charges. All costs such as lighterage and transfer will be borne by the railway. In addition, the Yangtze River Ferry has a complex structure and requires a long time for inspection. In order to maintain transportation, the most efficient procedures should be used for construction and processing to ensure that ferry transportation is restored as soon as possible.

<h3>The Rent Reduction Movement Week Sends Letters to Various Groups and the Art World to Participate in the General Assembly; Rent Reduction Slogans Will Be Posted Throughout the City from the 25th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee will hold a Rent Reduction Movement Week, and the period from the 25th to the end of the month will be the commemorative period for the Rent Reduction Movement. Slogans will be posted throughout the city, and a Rent Reduction Movement General Assembly will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th to revive the market. The committee sent letters to various groups and the art world yesterday, urging them to participate and support the event. The letters are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Letter to Various Groups: Sirs, the decision of the first committee meeting of our association is that after a year of work in the Rent Reduction Movement, quite a few enlightened landlords have automatically reduced rents, but there are still many who are waiting and watching, so that rents cannot be unified. Therefore, only 1% of people have benefited from rent reduction. In order to implement a uniform rent reduction, we have specifically scheduled the period from the 25th to the end of the month as Rent Reduction Movement Week to commemorate and rekindle the spirit of cooperation, unity, and effort to achieve the goal of rent reduction. We have always admired your association's determination, enthusiasm, and efforts to seek public welfare. In addition to sending slogans, we hope that you will widely distribute them to shops to be posted in front of the door, and distribute leaflets, and strive to promote them, so that rents will be reduced, the burden will be lightened, and social order will be maintained. It will directly relieve the pain of the burden on citizens and indirectly revive the prosperity of the market. We believe that the wise people of the world will support this. When everyone works together, we can work together to promote and complete the rent reduction. This is a matter of urgency. Please also send representatives to participate in the Rent Reduction Movement General Assembly on the 25th. Addressed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, various fellow villagers associations, and various groups, from the Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee.</p>
<p>Letter to the Art World: Sirs, we have always admired your outstanding artistic skills and reputation at home and abroad, and we deeply admire you. Our association is a group of citizens in the concession. We have seen that the business market is declining day by day. If it is not adjusted, it will go bankrupt. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of life. At a time when prices are falling, rents should also be reduced. The heavy burden we bear, rent has accounted for more than 50%. Therefore, in order to revive the market and maintain social order and peace, the Rent Reduction Movement is an urgent task at present. Over the years, the call for rent reduction has been constant, but only a small part has benefited from rent reduction. Now, in order to achieve a unified rent reduction, we have scheduled the Rent Reduction Movement General Assembly to revive the market at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th. The meeting has decided to publicly invite you to perform opera, comedy, and Shanghai opera. We have always admired your enthusiasm for the public good and we are sure you will approve. The opening will be at 2:00 p.m. Please be sure to come at that time. Please let us know the time. Addressed to the entertainment world and the art world, from the Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee.</p>
<h3>The Seawalls in Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan Near Shanghai Are Strong and There Is No Fear of Autumn Floods; The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government Pay Close Attention to Protection; The Seawall Projects in Various Sections of Baoshan County Have Been Completed</h3>
<p>The coastal seawall projects belonging to Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai have been extensively repaired since the seawalls in the past two years were in danger during the autumn floods. Now that the autumn flood season is approaching, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government are aware of the importance of the seawalls and have paid close attention to protection projects to prevent accidents. A reporter from the Dabai News Agency has recorded the details below:</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Pays Attention The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the seawalls and embankments of the counties under its jurisdiction, such as Taicang, Baoshan, Songjiang, Changshu, and Jiading, are very important to the safety of Jiangnan, especially the three counties of Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan. In the past two years, the seawalls were not strong and accidents occurred, and the counties suffered considerable losses. Now that the autumn flood season has arrived, in order to avoid repeating the mistakes, the Construction Department has set up seawall offices in various counties to pay close attention to protection work, and has sent engineers to the coastal counties to inspect the safety of the projects.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Seawalls in Baoshan and Taicang The seawalls in Baoshan and Taicang are located at the important points of the Yangtze River and the sea. The current is turbulent and the wind and waves are particularly strong. A reporter from the Dabai News Agency went to the Baoshan County Government the day before yesterday to inquire. It was learned that the seawalls in the county were repaired last year with funds allocated by the provincial government, and most of them are now relatively safe. However, there are still several sections that are in danger. After County Chief Long Tiyao reported to the province and personally supervised the active repair, the five sections of the embankment body in Chenhua Port, Xiaoshabei, and Wuyue墩 were filled with sandbags and thrown with stones for a length of about 200 meters. They have all been completed, so the seawalls in the county are generally very strong. There should be no fear of autumn floods if there are no excessive winds and waves. It is also said that the seawall projects in Taicang and Jiading are also strong.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Is Also Concerned About the Safety of the Seawalls As for the seawalls in this city, such as Wusong and Gaoqiao, many accidents occurred during the typhoon season in the autumn of the year before last. At that time, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works temporarily carried out emergency repairs. Now that the bureau believes that the autumn flood season is approaching again, in order to ensure the safety of the seawalls during the typhoon season, it has decided to start protecting and repairing them to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Audit Office Begins to Audit the Shanghai Municipal Government's Budget; Lin Jinyu Will Return to Shanghai from Hangzhou Today</h3>

Lin Jinyu, director of the office, went to Hangzhou last week on business and will return to Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Jiangxi Provincial Government to Abolish Porcelain Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial Government, saying: "To Chairman Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in Nanchang, This Chamber received a letter from the Shanghai Porcelain Industry Association on the 21st of this month, stating that since last September, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, has been levying a temporary subsidy to suppress bandits and comfort merchants on porcelain goods from all ports traveling to Jingdezhen. Merchants from various ports have repeatedly petitioned against this tax. However, due to the special circumstances of natural disasters and banditry in Jiangxi Province, the goal of abolishing the tax has not been achieved. Now that the one-year term has expired, based on the Jiangxi Provincial Government's announcement of abolishing the tax after one year, and the Executive Yuan's instruction to abolish it immediately upon the expiration of the one-year term, porcelain merchants from various routes including Beijing and Shanghai have unanimously contacted each other and sent representatives to appeal again to the Military Affairs Commission's headquarters and the Ministry of Finance. Recently, we received Directive No. 1762 of the Military Affairs Commission Chairman's headquarters, 理核字, dated July 30, 24th year of the Republic, stating, 'Received the report, and have already ordered the Jiangxi Provincial Government to handle it according to the case. Please be informed.' Also received Directive No. 6643, 賦字, of the Ministry of Finance, stating, 'Received the report and have already informed the Jiangxi Provincial Government to investigate and stop the levy as scheduled. Please be informed.' These directives are on file. It is therefore apparent that the ashes of this porcelain tax have been extinguished and should not be rekindled. We are hereby writing to earnestly request your association to promptly forward this to the Jiangxi Provincial Government, requesting them to comply with repeated orders and abolish the porcelain tax on schedule, to alleviate the merchants' distress and safeguard national products, which would be in the public interest, etc.' Attached is a photographic copy of the announcement issued by your government when handling this tax. Upon reviewing the seven articles of the regulations attached to the announcement, the said tax bureau stipulated a one-year term, which will expire this September. According to the third article of the regulations, the actual annual payment of the tax does not exceed 165,000 yuan, which does not greatly benefit public funds, while the porcelain merchants suffer greatly. With the bandits in Jiangxi suppressed for over a year, it is urgent to abolish these unavoidable taxes, so that industry and commerce can recover. Porcelain is a special product of Jiangxi Province, and it has declined significantly in recent years. It should be encouraged and protected to restore its prosperity. This temporary subsidy to suppress bandits and comfort merchants on porcelain goods bureau, which has a one-year term, should be abolished upon expiration to comply with the original plan and maintain political integrity. This is not only what porcelain merchants hope for, but also the opportunity for the revival of commerce in Jiangxi Province may depend on it. Therefore, we earnestly telegraphed to request your government to review and approve the matter, which would be in the public interest. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully." Briefly,</p>

<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Initiate the Organization of the Overseas Chinese Unemployment Relief Center; Preparations Have Begun and a Date for Establishment Has Been Set</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, Central Committee members Zhang Fakui, Huang Musong, Xiao Jishan, and overseas Chinese Li Zhiming and others recently initiated the organization of the Overseas Chinese Unemployment Relief Center and have rented No. 6, Lane 256, Rue Lupan as the association's premises. Preparations are actively underway. Yesterday, they specifically submitted a report to the Municipal Party Headquarters requesting registration. The original report stated: "Regarding the matter of requesting registration, Zhiming and others, in view of the global economic panic, the decline of industry and commerce, and the countless overseas Chinese who are unemployed and abused by the governments of their residing countries and deported back to China, if no measures are taken to provide relief, the unemployed overseas Chinese will have their livelihoods cut off. How can they sit idly by and wait for death? In the event that they take desperate risks, it will cause social unrest. Therefore, witnessing the suffering firsthand, and deeply understanding their pain, we, without considering our humble abilities, have united with like-minded comrades to organize the Overseas Chinese Unemployment Relief Center in Shanghai to carry out preparations, hoping to raise funds through various channels to provide relief to overseas Chinese who are unemployed and returning to China, and to revitalize industries, increase production, and recover our rights, which is also an important plan to save the country. We hereby submit this document requesting your review and approval for registration, which would be in the public interest."</p>

<h3>British Ships Compete on the Nanhua Line; Jardine Matheson and New Delsnider to Arrive in Shanghai; Reception and Tour Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>In recent years, the shipping industry has been sluggish. On the coastal routes, the Beiyang route has been declining due to excessive ships. On the Nanyang route, however, business is relatively better. Recently, the trend in the shipping industry is that it is difficult to attract customers without new and fast ships. Therefore, the British company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. decided to sell its older ships at a reduced price. Before the new ships are built, it will temporarily charter ships for operation. The company's newly built new sea ship, named New Delsnider (the company's original Delsnider ship has been scrapped long ago, and the old name is still used to indicate compensation), Tacksang, has been completed. The ship's deadweight is larger than the current ships, and the engine parts are the latest type. The passenger cabin layout is extremely beautiful. Yesterday, a telegram was received in Shanghai that the ship's first voyage from Hong Kong is now bound for Guangzhou and will soon sail to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port on the morning of the 28th of this month. After arriving in Shanghai, it will dock at the Shuntai Wharf. Because this ship is on its maiden voyage to Shanghai, the company plans to invite people from all walks of life to visit the ship. It is scheduled to go to Qingdao first, then return to Shanghai and sail to Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou.</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange Property Mortgage Accumulates Over 1.8 Million in Debt; Principal Not Repaid, Interest Not Paid, British Mortgagee Sues; Xue Zhusun and Zhang Weiru Accused of Neglecting Mortgage</h3>
<p>In April of the 13th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange mortgaged five English-registered title deeds, totaling ten mu, three fen, four li, and eight hao of land, together with all the buildings on the surface, to Henry Leste, a wealthy British expatriate in Shanghai, for 400,000 taels of silver. A contract was signed, stipulating that the annual interest rate was 9%, with a term of three years. If the mortgagor defaulted on interest or other contractual matters, the mortgagee could dispose of the mortgaged property. In August of the following year, the exchange again added 200,000 taels of silver to the original mortgage. Before long, Henry Leste died, and all his遗产 (estate/legacy) was entrusted to British nationals Maurice Nahum and Baird Walker, etc., by the British Assessor's Office in Shanghai. When the mortgage term expired, the exchange was unable to repay the loan and requested a three-year extension from the custodians. By April 10th of the 19th year, the principal and interest should have been repaid. However, in October of the 18th year, they added another 100,000 taels of silver, reducing the interest rate to 8.5% per annum, and extending the redemption period to April of the 22nd year. But in August of the 21st year, they added another 150,000 taels of silver. Together with the previous mortgages, the total was 850,000 taels. Because our country had implemented the abandonment of taels and the adoption of yuan at that time, for the sake of legal calculation, the silver amount was converted into foreign currency, totaling 1,188,811.19 yuan in national currency. At the same time, Zhang Weiru, chairman of the exchange, asked Xue Zhusun to be the guarantor. When the agreed redemption period arrived, they were still unable to repay the loan. They then requested another extension and added mortgaged property, one mu, six fen, five li, and four hao of English-registered title deed land. The mortgagee added a mortgage of 629,370.63 yuan in foreign currency. The entire mortgage became 1,818,181.82 yuan. The interest payable was originally paid by the exchange on schedule, with no delays. However, after October 10th of last year, each installment of interest was in arrears. Even the land tax and the insurance premium for the buildings on the ground were not paid. Despite repeated reminders from the mortgagee, the exchange delayed under various excuses. The guarantor Xue Zhusun also failed to fulfill his guarantee responsibility. Therefore, Maurice et al. recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against Xue Zhusun and Zhang Weiru for neglecting the mortgage, requesting the court to order the defendants to repay the mortgage of 1,818,181.82 yuan, the advance payment of 13,207.93 yuan, and interest. Yesterday morning, judge Shen presided over the hearing, summoning the two defendants, represented by lawyers Chen Yingtan and Tang Yan, etc., who raised the issue of the subject of the lawsuit, stating that Xue and Zhang could not represent the exchange. However, this claim was rejected by Judge Shen in court. The defendants' lawyer then stated that they would appeal, so the proceedings of this case had to be suspended until the appeal was ruled on. Judge Shen therefore ruled to postpone the hearing.</p>

<h3>Jewish Woman's Rescue of a Girl; Jewish Youth Group Plans to Award a Medal</h3>
<p>The 字林報 (North-China Daily News) reports that Ms. Rubaski, a Jewish woman, bravely rescued a drowning girl at the risk of her own life. The Jewish Youth Group in the port commended her for her bravery and plans to award her a medal. Last Sunday, a troop of girls from the group was camping on the bank of a river near Jiaozhou, and Ms. Rubaski was in command. According to eyewitnesses, while the girls were bathing in the river, one of them, swimming a hundred yards away, was suddenly caught in a whirlpool and could not support herself. Ms. Rubaski immediately jumped into the water to save her, but the girl held on to Ms. Rubaski tightly, causing Ms. Rubaski to be unable to move. Seeing that the situation was not good, Ms. Rubaski dived into the water and pushed the girl away violently, thus allowing her to escape danger. She herself, however, had her lungs full of water and was unconscious and sinking. Fortunately, a sampan passed by at this time and helped her ashore. The girls then applied first aid to rescue Ms. Rubaski. Now, a doctor and the senior leaders of the group are going to Jiaozhou to bring her south.</p>

<h3>Russian Woman Overwhelmed by Shock: A Sleeping Pill Becomes a Long Sleep; Overdose of Sleeping Pills Leads to Death Due to Potency</h3>
<p>Russian woman Bao Bao Fu Yina, also known as Xie Reng Dai Yina (transliteration), residing at No. 10 Linde Fang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, was a 35-year-old typist at the British-owned Glick World Detective Protection Agency office in Room 301, Building No. 2, Beijing Road. Her husband's name was Bao Bao Fu. Because she was having an affair with a fellow Russian named Xie Reng Dai Na Ai (transliteration), she had two names. Her husband's occupation is unknown. Her lover, Xie Reng Dai Na Ai, is currently working as a security guard for someone surnamed "Mou" at the Great World amusement center. On the morning of the 19th of this month, the woman went to work at the office. Wan Mu Ai Hua Qu Xi Sai (transliteration), a Russian assistant in the office, committed suicide by shooting himself in the office because he was unable to cover his gambling debts. After hearing the gunshot and witnessing Wan's death, the woman's nerves were severely shocked. After returning home that evening, she was unable to sleep, so she took sleeping pills to induce sleep. Unexpectedly, she overdosed, and she did not wake up the next morning. After being discovered by her family, she was sent to the Russian Hospital on Rue Cardinal Foch in the French Concession for treatment. However, due to the potency of the drug and the severity of the poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 6:00 PM on the 21st. As per usual, the hospital reported this to the French police, who sent Russian officers to investigate. The body was transported to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Delastre (commonly known as the Small Hospital). Yesterday morning, the French police reported to the Special District Court No. 2, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, a forensic doctor, and a clerk to the hospital to examine the body. It was confirmed that the deceased, Bao Bao Fu Yina, also known as Xie Reng Dai Yina, had died due to an overdose of sleeping pills. The body was released to her relative Xie Reng Dai Na Ai, who signed a guarantee to claim it.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Mrs. Xint, a Russian national and secretary at the World Detective Protection Agency, age 32, became unconscious after taking tranquilizer pills on the day after a detective employed by the agency, a Russian named Xu Te, committed suicide by gunshot on Monday. She was taken to the Russian Hospital for treatment but died at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 20th). It is believed that the woman was too shocked by the tragic death of her colleague to sleep, so she took tranquilizer pills, but unfortunately, she took too many and followed her colleague to the afterlife. The woman and her husband had been living in Shanghai for twelve years and had a two-year-old son.</p>
<h3>Two Bookstores: Obscene Books Confiscated; Police Currently Reviewing; All Books Seized First</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, after discovering that the books "Seventh Aunt" and "Such a Secret" sold at the Menli Bookstore at No. 221 Shandong Road, Public Concession, and the book "Lustful Sea: Sexual Tide (Second Trial)" sold at the Haoyundao Bookstore at No. 47 Jiaotong Road all contained obscene content, requested search warrants from the Shanghai First Special District Court. Yesterday, detectives Shao Mingyuan, together with Chief Inspector Gao Yanrong of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, were dispatched to search the two bookstores. They seized 44 copies of "Seventh Aunt," 120 copies of "Such a Secret," and 240 copies of "Lustful Sea: Sexual Tide," and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, attorney Jiang Baolian of the police station stated to Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court, that the police are currently reviewing the seized books. If it is confirmed that they are harmful to public morals, a prosecution will be initiated. Therefore, the seized books will be impounded. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, stated that Manli Bookstore was selling illegal books again, and if this review confirms that they are harmful to public morals, its business could be suspended according to the rules for repeat offenders. He then ordered the seized books to be impounded temporarily and handed over to the police for review.</p>
<h3>Linqing Primary School Sealed for Rent Arrears; Resistance to Enforcement Punished; Yu Shouqing Fined 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>Linqing Primary School, located at Nos. 20-22 Linqing Road, Pudong, was sued in court by the landlord due to substantial rent arrears. A judgment had been entered and the court had previously attempted to enforce it according to the law. However, out of consideration for the educational endeavor, the landlord did not formally seal the premises. This situation persisted from February of this year until now without resolution, forcing the landlord to apply to the First Special District Court for enforcement of the sealing. A few days ago, the court dispatched court bailiff He Ruyan, accompanied by police officers, to carry out the sealing. Due to resistance from the school, the bailiff notified the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Police Sergeant Dong Ruisheng and Foreign Police Officer Phillips to assist. However, Ren Chonggao, a teacher at the school from Sichuan, continued to refuse to cooperate. While the bailiff was inventorying the school's movable property, Yu Shouqing, a native of Yangzhou and the son of a school director, suddenly entered the premises. Foreign Police Officer Phillips immediately ordered him to leave, but Yu attempted to use force, resulting in his arrest by the police sergeant. Ren Chonggao also attempted to retrieve Yu, leading to his arrest as well. After the arrest of Yu and Ren, there was no further resistance, and the bailiff was able to seal the premises peacefully. Yesterday, the police transferred Yu and Ren to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan presented the facts and initiated prosecution under Article 135, Clause 1 of the Criminal Code. After interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng, Yu Shouqing was sentenced to a fine of 80 yuan. If he could not pay, he was to commute it to penal labor at a rate of two yuan per day. Ren Chonggao was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver Accused of Adultery; First Case Since New Criminal Code Took Effect; Paramour Claims Cohabitation for Six or Seven Years</h3>
<p>Yang Jinshi, a woman from Haimen, 32 years old, was married thirteen years ago to Yang Gengquan, a local taxi driver, through a matchmaker. They lived together on Pingliang Road in the Public Concession and had two children. Their marital relationship was generally good. Recently, Yang Jinshi learned that her husband was having an affair with Wu Xuezhen, a young local woman, and that they were cohabiting at No. 227 Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, neglecting Jinshi. Consumed by resentment, Jinshi secretly went to the address to catch them in the act. She found Yang and Wu sleeping together in the same bed, entwined in each other's arms, and was filled with jealousy. She seized both of them and took them to the Rue du Lieutenant Foch Police Station for investigation. After questioning by the police sergeant, both men and women were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Chen Pusheng interrogated them in the Eighth Criminal Division. Attorney Yao Zhaodi of the Police Department presented the case, stating that the Police Department had not yet investigated the adultery of the defendants and requested that they be detained temporarily for one day pending investigation of the case before requesting a hearing. The defendants were defended by attorney Huang Xiubo. After briefly questioning the defendants about their age and origin, the court ordered a rescheduling for the 26th. Both defendants were required to post bail of 500 yuan to ensure their appearance when summoned. Without bail, they were to be detained. It is noted that the new Criminal Code took effect on July 1st. Article 239 of the Criminal Code stipulates that anyone with a spouse who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, and the same applies to the adulterer. The old Criminal Code did not have provisions for a married man committing adultery with another person. The current legal article was added after much debate during the revision of the new Criminal Code in the late spring and early summer of this year. The Second Special District Court's acceptance of this case is the first since the new Criminal Code took effect. According to Wu Xuezhen, she has been cohabiting with Yang Gengquan for six or seven years. It remains to be seen what the judgment will be.</p>

<h3>More Than 400 Households in the Caopeng District of Nanshi Bao'an Road Voluntarily Relocate Yesterday; Tongren Fuyuan Hall Recovers the Land Foundation; More Than a Thousand Poor People Will Be Sent Back to Their Native Places</h3>
<p>Next to Cuiwei Nunnery on Bao'an Road in Nanshi, there is a vacant lot with about 400 households of poor people living in makeshift grass shacks. The land foundation belongs to Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The hall has not collected any rent for more than ten years. This time, because they wanted to recover the land for their own use, they posted a notice last winter advising the shack dwellers to relocate. They also wrote to the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that Police Chief Li send police to supervise the demolition. However, the shack dwellers ignored the notice. They subsequently requested Police Chief Li twice, on April 1st and June 14th, to summon the shack dweller representatives Wang Binqing and others to the bureau for kind persuasion. Tongren Fuyuan Hall provided 284 yuan for relocation expenses, and they were given ten days to relocate. However, the shack dwellers remained stubborn and refused to comply. Police Chief Li was recently ordered to enforce the relocation and demolish the shacks immediately. He summoned the three representatives Wang Binqing, Li Shouyin, and Chen Buqui to the bureau and advised them to demolish the shacks immediately, but they did not agree. Moreover, the shack dweller Yang Wenqi and others led more than 500 men and women to petition the West Gate Branch a few days ago. As a result, Police Chief Li requested that Tongren Fuyuan Hall allocate an additional 400 yuan for relocation expenses. Only then did the shack dwellers sign the agreement to relocate voluntarily yesterday. The West Gate Branch has contacted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to arrange for the repatriation of the shack dwellers to their native places. A total of more than 1,500 people will be transported in five batches to Xiamen (Yu Shun Wheel), Shantou and Guangdong (Hai Yi Wheel), Nanjing (Jianguo Wheel), and other places.</p>
<h3>After the Start of Autumn, the Temperature Was Particularly High Yesterday; Maximum of 97.7 Degrees; Two Hurricanes Are Still Far Away</h3>
<p>Yesterday's climate in Shanghai was exceptionally clear from morning, with not a cloud in the sky. In the afternoon, it suddenly turned muggy, and dark clouds moved around unpredictably. A brief shower occurred around 2:00 PM and stopped shortly thereafter. Although it was completely clear in the evening, the heat did not diminish. According to information obtained from the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai, the maximum temperature yesterday was 97.7 degrees, and the minimum was 74.3 degrees. Such sultry weather in autumn is rare. Regarding the movement of the two hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean, according to a report received by the observatory at 2:00 PM, the one slightly closer to China was located at 18 degrees North latitude and 126 degrees East longitude, moving northwest, with a radius of 60 nautical miles, about 300 nautical miles east of southern Luzon. The other one was located at 17 degrees North latitude and 147 degrees East longitude, moving west-northwest, with a radius of 120 nautical miles, very far south of China, and is expected to be near the Java Islands.</p>
<h3>Wu Tingsheng Discusses Difficulties in Improving Tobacco Leaf in Xuchang; Lack of Funds Makes It Impossible to Manage; Numerous Bandits Disrupt Rural Areas; High Transportation Costs Cause Tobacco Farmers to Lament</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Wu Tingsheng, executive member of the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, to inquire about the recent situation of tobacco leaf in Xuchang. According to him, among Chinese tobacco leaves, the quality of Xuchang tobacco leaf used to be the best. However, in recent years, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, it has plummeted. The Ministry of Finance, for the sake of the county's tobacco production, organized the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee to engage in improvement work. However, this year, from the beginning of the improvement work, it suffered blows from wind and floods, so the first batch of tobacco leaves produced, although of an improved variety, was not much different from the non-improved variety. This is still a small matter. In the future, the improvement work will face even more difficulties, which are briefly described below: (1) Lack of Cash: According to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, the improvement fee for improving Xuchang tobacco leaf is only 50,000 yuan. After buying American varieties and thermometers, there is little left. Moreover, the improved variety of tobacco leaves produced this year cannot be sold because there are too many tobacco leaves left over from last year, which remain in Xuchang. This prevents cash from circulating, and there is no cash to buy goods. (2) Numerous Bandits: There are many bandits in the counties under Xuchang's jurisdiction. Except for the city walls that can guarantee safety, there is no day of peace in the villages and towns. Tobacco farmers are all affected by it. Although the tobacco leaves have now been produced, they dare not transport them to the city for sale. (3) High Transportation Costs: Currently, the transportation price from Xuchang to Pukou, handled by a transportation company, is 200 yuan per truck. The tobacco farmers all lament such a huge expense. In the past, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications intended to reduce water transportation costs and were responsible for transportation. However, considering the livelihood of the more than sixty transportation companies in Xuchang, there is still no concrete solution. All of these factors are sufficient to hinder future improvement work. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly seek a way to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health: Regulations for General Registration of Prepared Medicines; Temporary Receiving Office Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association previously requested the Ministry of Health to amend the rules for managing prepared medicines and reduce fees. The ministry specifically issued a notice in Shanghai yesterday, stating that since the promulgation of the Rules for Managing Prepared Medicines, many pharmaceutical merchants have applied for inspection of prepared medicines in accordance with the regulations. However, very few have truly met the requirements of the regulations and have been granted a license. The ministry has repeatedly received requests from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association, and others, requesting amendments to the Rules for Managing Prepared Medicines, reduction of fees, lenient review, flexible registration, and consideration for the difficulties of merchants. Now, the ministry has stipulated the following: (1) From now until December 31st of this year is the general registration period for prepared medicines. During this period, the inspection fee is reduced to 15 yuan per type, the license fee is 1 yuan, and the stamp duty is 1 yuan. The required documents should still be submitted as usual. If the number of prepared medicine types to be inspected is large, permission may be granted to pay the license fee and stamp duty first and pay the inspection fee when receiving the license. (2) General registration of prepared medicines is limited to the registration of the place of production. (3) Article 8 of the Rules for Managing Prepared Medicines, the restrictions on poisonous and potent medicines are revised as follows: (A) If poisonous and potent medicines recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia are added, the amount used each time for internal medicine should not exceed one-third of the amount for single medicinal use listed in the Pharmacopoeia. The use of external medicine is not subject to this restriction and will be determined separately. (B) If poisonous and potent medicines not recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia are added, the amount used each time will be determined by the ministry. This has been reported to the Executive Yuan for record and has been approved and notified. Now, in accordance with Instruction No. 1524 from the Executive Yuan, which states, "Noted. Approved for record. You should notify accordingly. This order," etc., this notice is hereby issued. The ministry has established a temporary receiving office for prepared medicine registration at the Shanghai Health Bureau Hygiene Testing Institute, Xin Guang Ji East Street, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Silver Dollars for Export; Arrested</h3>
<p>Since the US government raised its silver policy, unscrupulous merchants have been smuggling domestic silver for export in order to seek huge profits. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations Prohibiting the Smuggling of Silver Dollars for Export on July 15th of this year, ordering all customs houses and provincial and municipal governments nationwide to instruct military and police authorities to strictly inspect passengers boarding and disembarking ships and trains. At 0:05 AM on the morning before last, Customs Inspector Huo Zhifen and Tax Police No. 186 routinely went to the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong to inspect the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou steamboat bound for Dalian (the ship had not yet set sail). They found 109 silver dollars inside the clothing of Zhu Shunjin (46 years old, from Ningbo), the ship's mess steward. They immediately notified the Water Patrol Police Station, which dispatched Detective Qu Hequi to arrest him. The man and the evidence were taken to the police station, and the silver dollars were taken back to the customs house by the inspector.

<h3>Defamation Case: Awaiting the Conclusion of the Embezzlement Trial for Rehearing</h3>
<p>Qin Jiugao from Nantong recently filed a private lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the District Court against his fellow townsman, Sun Shifu, claiming that Sun should not have published articles without cause, damaging his reputation. The lawsuit stated that reputation is a person's second life, and now that it has been damaged, how can he establish himself in society in the future? Therefore, he legally requests a thorough investigation. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing yesterday at 9 a.m. in the Tenth Court, presided over by Judge Zhang Peiming. First, the plaintiff, Qin Jiugao, testified, stating that he is 29 years old and briefly recounted the past situation. Next, the defendant, Sun Shifu, testified, stating that he is 49 years old. The plaintiff used to be a bookkeeper in my village. Last winter, he and his colleague, Chen Jinming, went to Wuxi to collect payments but did not settle the accounts. He returned to his hometown and never came back. I have now filed an embezzlement lawsuit with the court. The judge asked, "Do you have evidence that he embezzled funds?" He replied, "The accounts of our village have always been managed by him." After reviewing the testimonies, the judge ordered the case to be suspended and scheduled for a joint hearing after the conclusion of the embezzlement case.</p>
<h3>Cai Xuzhou Sued for Abuse by His Wife</h3>
<p>Cai Xuzhou, a 50-year-old Shanghai resident, resides at No. 50, Lane 895, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai. Cai owns a construction factory and is quite wealthy. Recently, his adopted wife, Zhao Meizhen, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District District Court, accusing him of abuse and requesting a separation and alimony. After accepting the case, the court held a hearing yesterday morning in Civil Court Six, presided over by Judge Shen Hong. The plaintiff, Zhao Meizhen, arrived with her lawyer to await the hearing, while the defendant, Cai Xuzhou, did not appear and was represented by his lawyer, Chen Tingrui.

Last August, Cai took another concubine, and since then, he has abused me without cause, listening to rumors and gossip and beating me for no reason. It is impossible to live with him, and I request the court to approve the separation and order him to pay alimony of 103,000 yuan. However, the defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, representing the defendant, denied the abuse and stated that the plaintiff was not behaving like a virtuous woman. On May 11th of this year, around 5 or 6 a.m., the plaintiff even colluded with several gangsters to beat the defendant and cause him to bleed. Afterwards, she turned the defendant into the police station and then transferred him to the court. The case has already been concluded, and Cai Xuzhou was found not guilty. I request to examine the case files for verification, which will clarify the matter. However, the feelings between the plaintiff and defendant, as husband and wife, are not completely broken, and husband and wife have the obligation to live together. Therefore, I request the court to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. At this point, Judge Shen announced that since it was noon, the case would be rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Registration of Rickshaw Pullers in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The dispute over the registration of rickshaw pullers in the French Concession was resolved after Mr. Du Yuesheng took over the mediation. The registration fee of 5 jiao per rickshaw puller has been reduced by 60% by the French authorities, and the rickshaw business association has notified the rickshaw owners to comply. The content is as follows: "1. Starting from the 22nd of this month, the registration fee for rickshaw pullers will be only 2 jiao per person. 2. For the 5 jiao registration fee paid by each rickshaw puller before the 22nd of this month, 3 jiao should be refunded when the license is collected, that is, it must be refunded gradually when the license is collected, in order to avoid congestion." However, recently, the police stations have been assigning police officers to the main roads to detain rickshaws that have not been registered or have not registered three pullers per rickshaw, and order the rickshaw pullers to drag them to the police station for detention until the registration procedures are completed before they are returned. If the rickshaw puller has registered but does not carry a temporary registration certificate or a formal registration certificate, he will be sent home to fetch it for verification and still be fined one yuan. Therefore, in recent days, the number of rickshaws detained by various police stations and the number of rickshaw pullers fined is not small. The rickshaw owners have reported to the rickshaw business association, saying that it is difficult and painful. If the rickshaw pullers run away, many rickshaws are left idle, and even daily life cannot be maintained. The rickshaw business association has already submitted a petition to the French Consul General and the Chief Officer led by the rickshaw owners. Although the registration fee has been reduced somewhat, it is still waiting for a reply as to whether the inspection of the rickshaws can be extended.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read your newspaper's August 20th report that Engineer Hu Hongzhao represented Director Yang Xiaotian in going to Huangshan to build a villa. I found that the engineer is an engineering consultant of our committee. This trip to the mountain was to inspect the construction project. The report is a rumor and untrue. I hereby request you to verify and correct it. Sincerely, Huangshan Construction Committee in Anhui stationed in Shanghai, August 22.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I read your newspaper's August 22nd report on the news of "The Fish Market Will Move to a New Location at the End of the Month, and the Fish Industry Cooperation Problem Has Been Solved." I was very surprised. Our association's members (omitted) believe that they will never cooperate with the fish market until the difficulties are effectively resolved. Your newspaper's report that it has been resolved, and that most of the brokers are from the Sixteen Pupu Fish Market, is obviously untrue. I am deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I hereby request you to correct it to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Ice Fish Industry Association,</p>

<p>III. Regarding Talent Cultivation: Considering that teacher training is the most pressing issue in China's medical education at present, a medical teacher training institution should be established by the central government. On the one hand, current faculty members of various medical schools should be gathered for short-term training to provide temporary relief. On the other hand, systematic and thorough training should be carried out to cultivate medical professors and researchers and lay the foundation for improving China's medical education. The following lists the plans for higher education: (1) Prepare for the establishment of a "National Higher Medical Education Institution": Utilizing existing domestic medical education facilities that can provide teacher training, the Ministry of Education will organize a "National Higher Medical Education Institution" to start in September of the 25th year. The funding will be planned by this committee and submitted to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health for planning, and the Ministry of Education will immediately organize a preparatory committee to carry out all preparatory work; (2) Entrust existing well-equipped medical colleges in the country to temporarily cultivate the following teacher personnel:</p>
<p>Subject of Teaching Staff, Number of People, Entrusted Agency</p>
<p>(1) Physiology Teachers: 3, Peking University Medical School and Peking Union Medical College</p>
<p>(2) Pharmacology Teachers: 2, Shanghai National Medical College</p>
<p>(3) Anatomy Teachers: 3, National Tongji University Medical School and Private Union Medical College</p>
<p>(It was resolved that it be recommended to the Ministry of Education that from the 25th year onwards, medical research institutes should be established in existing well-equipped university medical schools or independent pharmacy schools to cooperate in the training of medical education teachers. This committee will plan the establishment of the research institutes and the method of practical cooperation, and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (1) This committee will request the Ministry of Education to designate the above-mentioned entrusted agencies to be responsible for cultivating various teacher personnel; (2) This committee will stipulate the method and quota for teacher scholarships, and send letters to various medical colleges and specialized medical schools to select and send personnel who should receive teacher training, and fill in detailed resumes for review. Those who pass the review will be assigned to designated agencies for appropriate training (those who have served as teachers or teaching assistants should indicate their teaching experience in detail. Medical school graduates should attach their academic transcripts); (3) The teacher scholarship is tentatively divided into the following two types: Type A, 1,200 to 2,400 yuan per person per year, qualified for those who have served as professors and have teaching experience, training period of one year; Type B, 600 to 1,200 yuan per person per year, qualified for those who have served as teaching assistants or have special interest in the subject of teacher training, training period of two years. This type of scholarship is qualified for graduates of university medical schools, specialized medical schools, or independent colleges; (4) After completing the training period, return to the original medical college or specialized medical school for at least two years of teaching; (3) Cultivation of other teaching affairs and administrative personnel: (1) Heads of affiliated medical hospitals and outpatient departments; (2) Head nurses of affiliated hospitals and teaching staff of nursing schools; (3) Teaching staff of midwifery schools and heads of affiliated maternity hospitals.

The most needy medical education institutions will be asked to select personnel, submit resumes, and send them to designated institutions for observation and practice after review and approval by the committee; (2) The observation and practice subsidy fee is 600 yuan per person for a period of six months, including travel expenses.</p>
<p>IV. Regarding Equipment: (1) Prepare for the establishment of a "Central Medical Education Supplies Manufacturing Plant": At present, almost all instruments and supplies used in medical education are imported, and the economic losses caused by this supply and demand every year are quite alarming. Faced with the current difficult situation of medical education funding, the inability to purchase sufficient equipment due to the high prices greatly affects the improvement of medical education. It is urgent to establish a medical education supplies manufacturing plant to manufacture various application instruments and supplies by ourselves. It can not only facilitate education but also restore rights and interests, which is indeed an important work in the economic recommendation that cannot be delayed. Method? (1) This committee will request the Ministry of Education to hire experts to prepare for the organization of the "Central Medical Education Supplies Manufacturing Plant"; (2) This committee will request the Gengkuan Committee to subsidize 60,000 yuan to start the business first; (3) This committee will collect names of medical education supplies and models, books, photos, etc. for reference; (4) This committee will collect technical personnel with this specialized training from various medical education institutions in the country, and first manufacture several of the most essential supplies for trial, such as Peking University Medical School, Private Union Medical College, and Hunan Xiangya Medical College, all of which have this type of talent and have already produced various products; (2) Implement centralized procurement of medical education supplies: The instruments and supplies of existing medical schools are all purchased separately, which is extremely uneconomical. Moreover, the instruments and supplies purchased by each school may not all be suitable or meet the standards. This committee should centrally purchase various educational supplies according to the equipment standards issued by the Ministry, and distribute them to various schools for application, and deduct the value of the instruments and supplies received from the school's expenses. This method can be tried first in the following schools: (1) National medical colleges; (2) All provincial and private schools that receive subsidy funds from the Ministry for designated equipment purposes. (It was resolved that (1) this method be postponed; (2) regarding medical education supplies, this committee will first investigate and collect materials, mark prices and place of origin, and publish them successively in the Medical Education Monthly for reference; (3) regarding the subsidy funds for designated equipment purchases received from the Ministry, when each school submits to the Ministry for approval to purchase various instruments and supplies, please ask the Ministry to hand over the list to the committee for review).</p>
<p>V. Regarding Improvement: 1. Hold expert panel meetings to review curriculum, equipment standards, teaching material outlines, etc. separately. Methods: This committee will request the Ministry of Education to hire curriculum standard reviewers from current professors of medical colleges and specialized medical schools in the country, and ask them to pay attention to the teaching implementation status of each school in accordance with the standards and outlines issued by the Ministry this year, and prepare a report before the end of this year and submit it to this committee. At the end of June of the 25th year, this committee will convene expert panel meetings to review the reports and collect opinions for reference by the Ministry. 2.

<h3>Siam Implements Compulsory Education, Still Severely Oppressing Overseas Chinese, Chao Opera's Request to Establish a Performers' School Rejected, Overseas Chinese Students Not Allowed to Wear Chinese Clothing</h3>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency) Since the Siamese government decided to exclude Chinese, it has been oppressing our overseas Chinese in various ways, canceling compulsory classes in various schools, increasing Siamese language courses, and successively closing 79 overseas Chinese schools. Although representatives of our overseas Chinese have repeatedly negotiated with the Siamese Ministry of Education, no results have been achieved. Later, although the Chinese government and public advocated boycotting Siamese rice to impose sanctions, the Siamese side remained stubborn and self-willed, and the anti-Chinese arrogance has not diminished. Recently, the government also issued an order prohibiting overseas Chinese students from wearing Chinese clothes, and strictly prohibited the Chao Opera "Zhongzheng Shun" troupe from requesting to establish a child performer school, which was also rejected. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency has learned the details from a certain overseas Chinese affairs agency in this port as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Students Prohibited from Wearing Chinese Clothes: In the public schools under the jurisdiction of Ukrolo County, Tunburi Province, Siam, many overseas Chinese children who have reached the compulsory education age are studying. However, their clothing is mostly casual home clothes. The county education bureau specifically ordered Chinese students to change into Siamese clothes. The parents of overseas Chinese students, under the pretext that Chinese clothing is a national dress, refused to change. As a result, the education bureau ordered that Chinese students are not allowed to study in the school. After this order was issued, the parents of general Chinese students jointly reported the situation to Yichang鐢披匿威特潘 of the Buri Province Assembly and requested negotiations with the provincial authorities. After receiving this application, 鐢披匿 once questioned the provincial government in the meeting, but no satisfactory answer has been received so far. It is found that Siam has no explicit regulations on the clothing of students in public schools. Usually, they wear freely according to their family situation. Only when important ceremonies are held, they temporarily wear uniforms. Therefore, this action is obviously intended to oppress overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Request to Establish a Performers' School Rejected: The Siamese Ministry of Education, in order to implement compulsory education, last year ordered all Chao Opera troupe leaders in Bangkok that all child performers who are within the compulsory period must enroll in schools. At that time, after receiving the order, the troupe leaders immediately registered the child performers. However, due to the nature of their profession, each child performer actually received only three or four days of education per month, and only one month per year. In order to provide child performers with a reasonable educational opportunity and avoid violating the compulsory education regulations, the Ministry of Education specially invited all Chao Opera troupe leaders to try to run child performer schools in the Chao Opera troupes. The troupe leaders all expressed their approval and tried to run three schools in the East Stage, East Lake, and Hangzhou theaters, directly under the Ministry of Education. All teachers and management of the schools were responsible by the Ministry of Education, and the results were quite impressive. Recently, the troupe leader of Zhongzheng Shun Troupe also wrote to the Siamese Ministry of Education requesting to run a child performer school in the troupe, but the Ministry of Education rejected the request on the grounds that "the above three schools are still in the trial period, and will be expanded after the results are available." However, according to overseas Chinese sources, the Siamese Ministry of Education will wait for the students of the above three troupes to complete their studies and will not continue to run them, and will still order the child performers of various Chao Opera troupes to study in schools.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Ordered to Fully Implement Children's Laws</h3>
<p>The municipal government issued an order to various bureaus yesterday, saying that according to Executive Yuan Instruction No. 4363, the National Government Instruction No. 607 of July 31, 24th year of the Republic of China, was issued for compliance. It is found that children are the foundation of the nation's life. At the beginning of Children's Year, all organs, schools and organizations throughout the country should implement all laws and regulations to seek the welfare of children. Regarding the happiness of children in our country, such as school-age children, they should receive compulsory education, and children in school should be given excellent knowledge and physical training. New methods should be used to assist in childbirth for fetuses, and infants and all children should be promoted in health and prevented from infectious diseases. There are explicit provisions in the current provisional laws and various educational regulations and health programs. In addition, for the protection of children's life and rights, the employment age of child laborers and apprentices, and the restriction of work and study hours, there are detailed special articles in the current Criminal Law and Factory Law. As for the international conventions prohibiting the trafficking of women and children, our country has also signed them jointly with various countries. If they can be implemented one by one, it will be of great benefit to children. However, the improvement of children's food, clothing, housing and transportation, the rescue of orphans and displaced persons, the education of the disabled and low-energy people, and the completeness of infant care institutions have not yet been determined by laws and regulations, or although there are regulations, there are still many omissions in planning and supplementing. It is really urgent. In order to increase children's happiness and consolidate the foundation of national survival, it is specially announced to the whole country that all organs should lead their subordinates and guide the people to earnestly invite applications for those who have laws and regulations to rely on but have not been able to implement them. Those that have not yet been stipulated or have omissions should be amended as soon as possible by the relevant organs during the year of Children's Year and submitted for approval. Furthermore, compulsory education is about to begin this year, and this matter is very important to the happiness of children. Moreover, at present, disasters are frequently seen in various places, and there are not a few children who are displaced and lost and need to be rescued. Special attention should be paid to the above two points and should not be ignored. This matter concerns the happiness of children and the future of the nation. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby ordered to be followed and transmitted to the subordinates and announced to the people to abide by it as one. This is the most important thing. This order, etc., is hereby ordered to be followed and transmitted to the subordinates and announced to the people to abide by it as one. This order, etc., is hereby ordered to be followed by the bureau and transmitted for compliance. This order.</p>

<h3>All Private Nursing Schools Should Go Through the Filing Procedures in Accordance With the Law</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a special announcement yesterday regarding the Ministry's order to instruct all private nursing schools to comply with the previous order and quickly go through the filing procedures.

<h3>Little Boy (23)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Hua Bilan was what the Scottish called "innocent," because, though already thirteen years old, he was still like a six-year-old child. He had once been exceptionally bright, but his father had pushed him too hard, giving him all sorts of difficult lessons, making him study books for six hours a day, hoping he would absorb knowledge like a Peking duck swallowing forcibly stuffed food. He thought he had truly fulfilled his father's duty, but he almost killed his child, for a fever had forced him to stop studying. After he recovered, his overused brain suddenly lost its function. Thus, Bilan's mind was like a slate that had been wiped clean with a sea sponge, utterly empty.</p>
<p>This was a great blow to his father, who had held such high hopes for him. He couldn't bear to see his promising child suddenly become an idiotic waste. So he sent him to Mei Manor, not hoping for much progress, but knowing he would be well cared for. How gentle and kind he was! Yet it was truly pitiful to see how hard he struggled to learn, as if groping in the dark for the knowledge he had lost, knowledge that had already cost him so much effort. Every day, he carefully looked at the letters, proudly saying A and B, thinking he recognized them. But by the next day, there was no trace, and the entire effort had to be started anew. Mr. Pei taught him with infinite patience. Although this seemed hopeless, he persevered. He did not focus on book learning, but gently tried to clear the heavy clouds from his clouded mind, to restore enough wisdom to reduce the suffering in his life.</p>

<p>Last night at 8:00 PM, the Guangdong team and the Langya team played the second round, second match of the Aile Cup table tennis tournament in the senior group at the Jiande Table Tennis Room. No fewer than two hundred people came to watch. Chen Linsheng served as referee, Liu Keren as inspector, and Chen Shaoji as recorder. It was found that the Guangdong team had won all its matches in the first round. If it could defeat Langya, it would gain the right to the finals. Therefore, the team's players were careful and worked hard to compete. However, because the cheerleaders were too enthusiastic, the order was slightly disrupted, but it was quickly restored. After a fierce battle, Rong Deneng and Zou Guofan in the first pair, and Chen Zhaowen and Guo Yuxiong in the fourth pair, played the most brilliantly. However, because Qian and Xie were absent from the Langya team, they lost to Guangdong by a score of 2 to 5. It is heard that the Guangdong team will hold the finals with the Jingwu team next week. According to the Jingwu team, although they were defeated by the Guangdong team in the first round, the members are determined to avenge this defeat, so they have been working hard in recent days, and it is expected that the two teams will inevitably meet on a narrow road, and a major battle will be unavoidable.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Drunk Woodcutter)</p>
<p>When we put on clean clothes and walk on the muddy and slippery road after the rain, as if facing a deep abyss and walking on thin ice, fearing that a little mud will splash on us, or else we might slip and fall and be covered in mud like a loach, how hateful that would be! But we must also think of ourselves standing in society, and keep our reputation as carefully as this.</p>
<p>When clothes get dirty, we wash them with soap, especially when the weather is hot, we wash them even more frequently, because we want to keep them clean. We know that dirty clothes are unhygienic and unsightly, so we must also reflect on our own mistakes and how they are criticized by others. Therefore, we must always keep in mind the saying, "What ten eyes see, ten hands point at," and change and wash ourselves as diligently as we change and wash our clothes. However, here we must also remember the ancient saying, "Don't be afraid to correct your mistakes"!</p>
<p>A strongman can lift a thousand pounds of stone weights, using both hands freely, without blushing or panting. If you were to replace him with a weaker person, not only would they be unable to lift it overhead, but their face would turn red and they would gasp for breath! This shows that a responsibility should be borne by someone who matches it, so that things can be in good order. But in modern times, that thousand pounds of stone weights does not need to be lifted by your own strength, as long as someone else's strength is available. Therefore, nowadays, there are countless strongmen complaining about the bad times where "heroes have no place to use their skills."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Shuliu Mountain Studio</h3>
<p>— Ying Ning</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Chunfan, the owner of the Shuliu Mountain Studio, passed away due to illness on the tenth day of this month. Another senior novelist has passed away, which is truly regrettable. I followed Mr. Zhang for several years and knew him quite well. I record his anecdotes for the readers of our newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was from Wujin, but he lived in Wuxia for a long time, so he spoke the soft language of the Wu dialect fluently. His novel *Nine-tailed Turtle* was also popular because it was mixed with Wu dialect. Mr. Zhang was twenty-seven years old when he wrote *Nine-tailed Turtle*. He first completed sixteen chapters, and on the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve, he took the manuscript to Mr. Zhang Jizhai of this newspaper (Mr. Jizhai was then the chief writer of this newspaper), and this newspaper printed and published it. Mr. Zhang received thirty gold pieces for the manuscript, which he used to live on for the year, which he considered great happiness. The following year, he completed another sixteen chapters, which were still published by this newspaper. After that, it was printed in succession to the twelfth series before it stopped. At that time, it was recited by every household, and almost everyone knew about *Nine-tailed Turtle*.</p>
<p>In 1929, Mr. Zhang deeply lamented the daily decline of national affairs, so he wrote to General Zhang Xueliang three times, discussing the way to govern the country. At that time, Mr. Zhang was inheriting his father's legacy and looked out over the Northeast with ambition. Those who knew believed that Mr. Zhang was the only one who could lay the foundation of the country on solid rock in the future. However, Mr. Zhang's words were not adopted by Mr. Zhang. When the Shenyang Incident occurred, Mr. Zhang stumbled abroad and could not return to his homeland.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang liked to watch movies. Because his residence was near the Central Grand Theater, he would always go with his wife, Ms. Pei Juan, whenever the movie changed, and he would always choose the front row because Mr. Zhang suffered from nearsightedness. Mr. Zhang also wrote articles based on what he saw in the movies and published them in the newspapers. Today, the three words "movie critic" have become a professional name, and Mr. Zhang can be considered a pioneer of "movie critics."</p>
<p>Sleeve arrows are a type of martial art, and Mr. Zhang practiced them when he was young. Because I saw a description of a sleeve arrow delivering a letter in *Nine-tailed Turtle*, I asked him about the usage when I met him one day. Mr. Zhang then demonstrated it in his study. Because there were no short arrows, he took a pen instead. The end of the pen shaft rested on the middle finger, and one end of the copper pen holder was placed on the side of the wrist. It was flicked upwards, and the force was entirely on the middle finger. Mr. Zhang said that when he was young, his body was not very burly, but after he gave up practicing martial arts (he was proficient in martial arts when he was young), he suddenly became fat.</p>
<p>In his later years, Mr. Zhang wrote many martial arts novels. When writing about the martial arts competition, he would always try out the offensive and defensive movements in the room first, and then write them down. His caution was like this. Those who write carelessly today should be ashamed of Mr. Zhang.</p>
<h3>Research on the Names of Things</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The names of things are very worthy of study and can be used as talking points. I feel that to make a thing pleasing, you must add beautiful words to it, especially food. It must have praise words like fragrant or sweet to stimulate people's appetite. However, upon careful thought, there are times when it backfires. For example, those who sell dried tofu always call it five-spice dried tofu. However, in the evening, when the vendors carrying the burdens of oil-fried stinky dried tofu call out to sell it, people do not cover their noses because it stinks, but instead dip it in chili sauce and eat it in large bites. It can be seen that while fragrant is certainly lovely, stinky is not necessarily offensive. Those who sell melons always claim that their melons are sweet, and even as a side dish with porridge, there are sweet pickled cucumbers. Unexpectedly, yesterday I saw an advertisement from a certain food shop: "Bitter melon is a famous plant in Guangzhou, with a slightly bitter taste, and has the function of clearing heat and relieving fever. We specially make bitter melon stir-fried beef, bitter melon stir-fried chicken slices, and other seasonal delicacies for the enjoyment of those who like them." So bitter and sweet each occupy a place. Isn't there a Shanghai saying that calls the inferiority of things "osmanthus"? Even ordinary white-faced people call ugly women "osmanthus widows," which seems to suggest that no one will come to consult things with osmanthus, which is truly incomprehensible. I don't know what kind of luck the fragrant golden osmanthus has had, but when cake shops sell New Year's cake at the end of the year, they hang up signs for "Osmanthus New Year's Cake," grandly displaying osmanthus without any hesitation. Isn't this strange? There is also a saying that calls mold "white flower." For example, a doctor who has no one to consult is called a "white flower doctor." When food goes white flower, it is unhygienic and unpalatable. However, those who sell lilies call them "white flower lilies," and white flower ones are much more expensive than ordinary ones. From this, it can be seen that there is nothing truly right and wrong in the world, and that the fragrance, stink, sweetness, and bitterness of tastes are small but obvious.</p>
<h3>Hoeing Weeds at Noon</h3>
<p>— (Xu Haowu)</p>
<p>It's supposed to be the time when "if June isn't hot, the five grains won't form."</p>
<p>The earth is a ball of fire. On the ridges of the fields, stray dogs have disappeared; only the farmers under their large straw hats, exposing their dark skin and tensing their thin muscles, toil tirelessly in the heat, interspersed among the slender green branches and leaves.</p>
<p>Last year was a drought - all work in vain, losing money, accumulating debts, and empty bellies.</p>
<p>This year, although the rain came a little late, it didn't stop after it came; but the things that were planted with hard work, heaven took care of them, and they weren't swept away by the continuous white waves elsewhere. Judging by the situation, if we can do our best....</p>
<p>"Hoeing weeds at noon, sweat drips onto the soil below...."</p>
<p>Sweat is blood, as long as blood can irrigate the seedlings; strength is life, as long as life can save everything!</p>
<p>Vanity, decadence - completely separated from the distorted reality of the city, we can see hope, action, sacrifice - the true meaning of life.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Qi Party Fawning and Flattering, Reprimanding a Petty Official; Mrs. Caine's Great Power Causes Chaos and Annoys Mrs.</p>
<p>Director Lan, under the hospitality of several attendants, went to his designated room to rest. Zhang Jiefu followed the welcoming party, but was only confined to the large living room downstairs. Although he did his best to appear generous, he was sitting alone on the side, as if isolated from the world, because the welcoming staff here all knew each other. At first, they thought he must be someone related to the director, but later, seeing that he was mixed in with everyone, they felt that his background was unclear and couldn't help but look at him. He smoked cigarettes, drank tea, and paced back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back. As time went on, his embarrassment gradually became apparent. However, he did his best to maintain himself, unwilling to fully reveal his embarrassment. He walked around the base of the wall, looking at the pictures in the glass frames on the wall. At this time, someone said, "Mr. Lan said that he didn't know you were still waiting here, so he went straight upstairs. Everyone has official business and dares not delay any longer, so they all returned. In a while, Mr. Lan will definitely go to pay his respects to each of you separately." Zhang Jiefu turned his head at this time and saw clearly that it was the official secretary Qiu Zecheng. After he finished speaking, without waiting for those welcoming representatives to contact him, he rushed forward two steps, nodding and bowing, and said with a smile, "Brother-in-law, brother-in-law! Just now I was welcoming the director at the gate, how come I didn't see you?" (297)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager had properly applied her own makeup, she instructed someone to summon the imperial hairdresser to come in and serve her. This hairdresser was naturally a eunuch, but according to his colleagues, his skills were unmatched in China, and no one could compare to him. Therefore, the Empress Dowager trusted him very much and often praised him. However, the hairdresser himself might not have been very willing to serve the Empress Dowager; firstly, because the Empress Dowager had a terrible temper, and he was liable to be scolded at any moment, making him feel constantly apprehensive, as if he were scratching a tiger. Sometimes, if he was careless and combed out a few too many hairs from the Empress Dowager's head, or accidentally hurt her while combing, he would not be spared. He would be immediately dragged out and beaten dozens of times with a palace staff. After being beaten, he would have to come back in and continue serving. However, such situations were extremely rare. Even if he combed out a few too many hairs, he had a quick way of concealing it from the Empress Dowager, quietly handing them to a palace maid standing nearby to dispose of. I imagine the palace maids were willing to help him cheat in this way because they could always extract some wealth from him. Even so, it was still worth it for him, better than being seen by the Empress Dowager and getting beaten dozens of times on the buttocks. Moreover, being beaten on the buttocks was not the most severe punishment; the Empress Dowager might not be satisfied and might even inflict a greater calamity! (397)</p>
<h3>雨露</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>In the morning, he was still sleeping peacefully in bed when he suddenly heard the "squeak, squeak..." sound of cartwheels rolling past on the street. He guessed that it was raining. Sure enough, when he jumped out of bed and pulled open the curtains facing the street, the wind and rain were already fiercely lashing at the top of the building.</p>
<p>Thinking that his appointment with his beloved would inevitably be hindered by this wind and rain, a layer of melancholy rose in his heart. (He hated the wind and rain!)</p>
<p>Dragging his heavy steps downstairs, he went to the small courtyard and suddenly saw that the flowers and plants, which had been withering under the oppression of the relentless sun for days, were now revived because they had received the nourishment of rain and dew. "The power of nature is truly great! How can one base one's loves and hates on personal feelings?" He couldn't help but sigh in this way. At the same time, he thought: "Rain and dew can nourish all things, why can't people enjoy it and instead hate it?" He even felt ashamed.</p>
<p>He walked down the steps of the courtyard and stood in the rain. Cool raindrops fell on his face, the green tree of life was irrigated by the rain and dew, and his youthful heart seemed to have melted together with the rain and dew.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement: I would like to thank Dr. Li Wucheng, a famous physician and graduate of Tongji Medical University, who has been the director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Baolong Hospital for many years. This spring, he was also awarded a doctorate in medicine from Germany. He has established his own clinic at No. 2, Alley 2, Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road. His reputation has spread far and wide, and patients flock to him. Dr. Li has also recognized that quitting smoking is an urgent matter, so he has applied scientific principles to research effective methods for quitting smoking. Based on his clinical experience, he has written a book entitled "On Quitting Smoking" (actual price is one dime, send a letter with eleven cents for postage to receive it). I received a complimentary copy yesterday and would like to express my gratitude here.</p>

<h3>大西洋中的女王</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The world's largest things are constantly emerging. Dirigibles, airplanes, ships, and bridges are being built by various countries in an effort to be the largest in the world. The French ship "Normandie" is the world's largest passenger ship. Its luxurious equipment and enormous volume can be compared with the German Zeppelin airship and the Russian Gorky airplane, which was destroyed. The title of "Queen of the Atlantic" is well deserved.</p>
<p>The "Normandie" was built by the French Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard. It took four years, from 1932 to its completion this year, and countless scientists poured their hearts and souls into creating this special crystalline product. It displaces over 79,200 tons, is 1,092 feet long, taller than the Eiffel Tower, and cost 83 million yuan to build. It departed from Le Havre on May 29th of this year and arrived in New York on June 3rd. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean in just 96 hours is unmatched by any other ship. Furthermore, because the hull is like a whale, it is the latest streamlined design. Therefore, regardless of wind, waves, or tides, it is unaffected. According to the results of its maiden voyage, the time between the two locations can be guaranteed to be accurate within a few minutes. As for the stability of the ship, anyone can feel no seasickness. Without going to the deck, one can almost forget that one is on a ship.</p>
<p>When you walk on the deck, you still can't find a vent pipe, and you can't even see a chain. The meticulous and thorough design is evident here. On ordinary ships, the sound of the machinery is ultimately unavoidable. However, the "Normandie" has eliminated this drawback. Because it is fireproof, the walls throughout the ship are lined with non-combustible asbestos. Even if a fire breaks out, the fire alarm in the room will notify the fire department at a certain temperature. On the one hand, the vents in the room will automatically close due to the ingenuity of the machinery, cutting off the oxygen supply. This type of wall is not only fireproof but also prevents the intrusion of machine noise, killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>If you have money, you can spend your entire life on the ship without wanting to go ashore. It can be said that there is no winter, and the ship has wide and long glass corridors, like greenhouses. Lying on the sofa, you can enjoy the warmth of the warm sun. The interior of the ship is divided into three floors, with eleven elevators transporting passengers. The car warehouse can accommodate hundreds of cars. If passengers are tired of playing on the ship, they can take a plane on the deck and play in the blue clouds before returning to the ship. The ship has a magnificent theater that can accommodate more than 300 people, with movies, dramas, and dances. In addition, there are eight or nine recreational places such as photography studios and wireless entertainment. There are special facilities for children. Westerners like to raise dogs, so there are even dog kennels and bathtubs. The swimming pool inside the ship is very large and can be used to play water polo, so even in summer, it is like living in a seaside resort.</p>
<p>Westerners also like to arrange flowers or give flowers as gifts. In the past, there were no fresh flowers on the ships, which was very inconvenient. However, the "Normandie" even has a flower garden, selling fresh flowers daily for passengers to give as gifts, which is also an innovation. The food on the ship is enough for a team of infantry to eat, and all of it is cooked with electricity, with each meal cooking 768 chickens. It is powered by electricity, with four 40,000-horsepower generators, totaling 160,000 horsepower. The power plants in large cities in our country, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, may be comparable to it. Because the power it generates is enough to maintain the needs of a city with a population of 300,000.</p>
<p>This massive ship can be driven by 400 people. However, the ship now has over a thousand employees, including officers, sailors, and waiters. The remaining six or seven hundred people are all serving the passengers and have nothing to do with the Queen herself.</p>

<h3>金融 Gold Market Turbulent, Daily Fluctuations Reach 25.4 Yuan, Short Covering Prevails, Mid-Day Rise Exceeds 10 Yuan After Initial Decline</h3>
<p>Although the gold market rose yesterday, the situation was unstable, turbulent, and difficult to grasp. It declined at the beginning of the session, then surged due to short-covering. The foreign exchange market was normal, but it was difficult to sustain the gains in the end. The morning opened with stable overseas silver markets, with London rising and the United States remaining flat. The demand for silver in India had subsided, and the forward silver price in Monterrey was unchanged or slightly higher by 1.5 basis points. London gold prices contracted by 1.5 pence. Exchange rates were extremely stable. Reports indicated that the United States would continue to support the silver market, causing slight fatigue in sentiment. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened lower at 77 yuan. Chunyuan, Yongfuxing, Yongheng, Yu Dada, Cheng Huixiang, Shenfeng, Hengchang, Yongli, and others sold bars successively, dropping to 73-74 yuan. The central bank's exchange rate announcement showed no change for both the British pound and the US dollar, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The posted price for gold was lowered to 929.7 yuan, slightly improving. After the opening, selling pressure remained strong, continuing the decline. Major players continued to cover shorts, and buyers took advantage of the situation, resulting in a rebound. However, due to banks trading against each other, the domestic market was mediocre. In addition, HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed no change for both the British pound and the US dollar, causing the market to fluctuate after the initial gains. The Hong Kong market opened tighter and exceeded 80 yuan, which initially stabilized sentiment. Major players and speculative traders went long, and significant short positions were covered. For a time, buying pressure was overwhelming, and the foreign exchange market followed suit, gradually rising. It once reached the 890 yuan level. Major players sold aggressively at the high, and the subsequent decline was rapid.

<h3>Ningbo Money Shops Recovers Term Loans</h3>
<p>The money shops of Ningbo have always had abundant funds. Every 40-tael month-end, they entrusted Shanghai money shops to lend large sums of foreign currency to various businesses and merchants. This has been the practice for the past two or thirty years. However, due to the poor market conditions this year, major financial crises occurred in both Shanghai and Ningbo, threatening their own safety. Therefore, they had to seek self-preservation by informing their agents that all long-term loans issued in Shanghai, even those not yet due, must be repaid upon maturity. While Shanghai's financial circles had no problem in previous years, they are now facing difficulties after the recent major blows and may find it hard to comply immediately. According to investigations, the outstanding loans from Ningbo money shops in Shanghai amount to no less than thirty million taels. If all these loans are recalled, Shanghai will be greatly affected. Under the current circumstances, even if only half of the amount is to be recovered, it would still require more than ten million taels. Where can such a large sum be found? Therefore, the general public is quite worried about this issue. It was heard yesterday that a few money shops are trying to find ways to repay over one and a half million taels through the Ningbo banks. (According to the reporter, most long-term loans are due in October "also known as the ninth month according to the lunar calendar." The total amount of loans issued in Shanghai is usually around seventy to eighty million taels. Even in the last term (i.e. the fourth month), due to the sluggish market, many loans were recalled, but the majority still remain outstanding. Now, before the due date, preparations are being made in advance, fearing a difficult hurdle when the time comes.)</p>
<h3>Securities: Bull and Bear Rollover, Bond Market Slowly Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last two or three days of this month's futures trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. However, the market remained sluggish with no significant fluctuations. Both the bulls and the bears remained unusually calm. Although both sides were rolling over positions, supply and demand appeared relatively balanced, but gradually weakening. Judging from the environment, everything seemed to favor the bulls, but the market remained depressed, with no improvement from morning to night. No. 48 still had long positions exiting the market, and their selling price was decreasing daily. If they were to dump their positions, it would inevitably lead to a short squeeze. The market price was low despite favorable conditions, which is not a good sign. Yesterday, during the four trading sessions, the market gradually declined from morning to night, struggling to recover. Sellers such as Nos. 5, 16, and 48 were increasing their stock offerings, while buyers were mostly Nos. 26 and 43. Overall, the market was stagnant, with a tendency to decline. With only two days left in this month's trading, although there may not be huge changes, mutual squeezing is still inevitable. At the end of the day, except for No. 18, which was slightly better by a dime, the rest all fell by five cents, ten cents, or up to half a dollar. The total volume traded was 2,325,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Industrial Stocks Rise Most Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New China Trading Company, yesterday (the 21st), the New York stock market advanced under the leadership of war-related stocks, such as steel, aviation, copper mines, chemicals, and nitrates. Automobile stocks rose due to investment. American Telephone and Telegraph rose because it paid its usual quarterly dividend of $2.25. Utility stocks rose slightly, as there was a possibility that Messrs. Gaylord, Lapham, and Davis would convene a meeting. Stocks on the small exchange rose, with utility stocks performing particularly well. The bond market was lively and slightly higher. The total volume traded was 1.75 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sales are Sluggish, Marked Yarn Briefly Plunges in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon After Hearing Marked Gold Soars</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, but the situation remained dull. The sales of spot yarn were weak, and various merchant groups did not have the capacity to purchase large quantities due to financial constraints. Recent market transactions were mostly of Japanese yarn, and the position of Chinese yarn was gradually lagging behind, with the selling price gap narrowing. This further deepened the difficulties for the mills.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster yarn fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. In the morning session, the marked yarn prices for all months fell uniformly. The near-month prices broke through the 71-yuan mark, making the situation appear even weaker. Because the short sellers for this month were preparing to deliver, they had already started doing so. Some yarn had been shipped into warehouses, but there was no proper way for the long positions to receive the goods. As a result, the floating long positions appeared even more uneasy, and selling pressure increased slightly. As a result, the prices for all months fell by six, eight, nine cents to one dollar and one dime compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market gradually rose after hearing that the marked gold price had suddenly soared, causing some short positions to cover and hold firm. However, the spot yarn market remained quiet. As a result, the prices for all months rose by five, six, and eight cents compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Dafu sold 1,150 bales, Yuda 300 bales, Dafeng 2,250 bales, Shenji 1,900 bales, Yicheng 300 bales, Hexing 200 bales, Changyu 500 bales, Hengchang 800 bales, Xinchang 600 bales, Yukang 300 bales, Tongji 600 bales, Yida 500 bales, Zhenda 400 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Runkang 400 bales, Dachang 500 bales, Shengyuan 850 bales, Xincheng 650 bales, and Changfeng 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot yarn fell by about one yuan. The spot yarn sales market became even quieter. The total amount purchased by various merchant groups for the day was 469 bales. The prices fell by five cents to one yuan. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed below.</p>
<h3>Cotton for this Month Re-enters the 6 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>After a sharp fall in the price of cotton for August delivery on the previous day, it rebounded again today. According to market sources, the long position companies held a meeting last night, and as a result, they aimed to squeeze the short positions. As a result, the market sentiment turned tight, and the price for the second session broke through the six-yuan mark again. At the same time, the marked gold price rebounded, bringing the market up with it.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao prices rise. In the morning session, the price of marked cotton for August delivery rose again by a dime, but prices for later months were softer. Due to good weather, the Ningbo and Taicang merchant groups sold short near-month contracts, causing the market to slacken slightly. As a result, the price for this month rose by three and a half dimes compared to the previous day's closing price, and the prices for later months were even more volatile. It was generally said that the long position companies had decided to take delivery, causing people's minds to tighten suddenly. As a result, the price for this month rose by three and a half dimes compared to the previous day's closing price, and the prices for later months fell by five cents to one and a half dimes. In the afternoon session, the price for near-month contracts was flat, while the price for later-month contracts was firmer. It was heard that the marked gold price had rebounded again, causing market sentiment to become more excited and short positions to cover. As a result, the price for this month fell by five cents compared to the morning closing price, while the price for later months rose by one and a half dimes to two and a half dimes. It was noted that Dafu sold 2,500 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Tongfeng 2,100 dan, Shenji 5,500 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, Changhe 1,600 dan, Hexing 1,000 dan, Shengyuan 1,200 dan, Yifeng 1,100 dan. The buyers were Yuan Yi 1,700 dan, Runkang 2,100 dan, Shengyuan 1,100 dan, Yongchang 1,600 dan, Yikang 3,500 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Shenchang 2,600 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan, Changfeng 1,600 dan, and Weihe 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton sales are quiet. The current sales of raw cotton remained sluggish, and factory demand was slow. The source estimated 300 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Wallace Opposes Loans, US Cotton Rise Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with gains of three to six points in various months. Trading was sluggish, seemingly waiting for a decision on cotton loans. The White House stated that a decision would be made soon, but President Roosevelt said that the time for a decision had not yet arrived. Industry sources hoped that the 1.25-cent loan would be approved. Early in the morning, the market price strengthened due to industry buying and short covering. However, after hearing that Secretary of Agriculture Wallace opposed the loan, long positions rushed to close out, and the market softened again. The closing was flat and weak. The spot price fell by five points, and the futures price fell by three to seven points. British cotton spot prices fell by two points, and futures prices rose by eight to nine points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegraph is listed on the left (telegraph of the 22nd).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 22nd, the opening forecast for white Ross cotton for April-May delivery was 203 rupees, down seven-eighths of a rupee from the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Mills to Cancel Price Increase from September</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with prices stable in all months. Since the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago continued to rise by about 60-70 cents and in Canada by about 30-50 cents, the market paid attention to the continued rise in foreign wheat. However, domestic sales remained weak, but due to the interrupted supply, the future could not avoid being affected. Therefore, factory shipments stopped, and market prices rose slightly. By the afternoon session, it was rumored that from the next month, the five-cent price increase by each factory would be automatically cancelled, which shook the position for this month and reduced trading. In the afternoon, only 80-90,000 bags were traded. As a result, this month was down one cent, September was up one cent, and October to January were up one cent and two and a half mills.</p>
<h3>Canadian and Argentine Wheat Crops Both Damaged, Local Wheat Market Waits and Sees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning with prices quiet. Since market transactions were few, both insiders and outsiders mostly took a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, although foreign wheat continued to rise by 50-70 cents, near and far-term prices showed little movement, and trading was extremely slow. By the afternoon session, the market suddenly weakened in all months. Because the flour market was weak and the removal of wheat from the market was not active, and because a certain firm had sold foreign wheat short, people became more and more tired. This month was close to delivery, and very few long positions were unloaded, so prices were particularly weak. As a result, this month fell four cents, September fell three cents, October fell one cent, and November rose one cent. Due to factories searching each other, wheat was not officially delivered.</p>
<p>Also, there were reports that wheat in Canada had been damaged by frost, and red and black spots had been found on the crops, causing significant damage. It was also reported that exports of Canadian wheat were quite good, and the market in Winnipeg was extremely strong. According to news from Argentina, the planting season was delayed, the situation was serious, and market activity was very good.</p>

<h3>More than 100 Bags of New Kunshan Xian Rice Arrive, Old Rice Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various merchant groups was slightly scarce, with only Nos. 13 and 14 arriving (a total of 2,500-2,600 piculs). However, since the market sentiment had deteriorated severely, there was no intention to make purchases. Sales were particularly weak, and besides some minor additions on this street, there were no large transactions. Stomach-covering merchant groups only sold 300-400 bags. After the sales opened for various goods, the market situation was weak, and the market color was downstream. Su Tong prices continued to fall by more than 20 cents, Nan Gang early rice prices continued to fall by 30 cents, and various late rice prices fell by 20 cents. Other varieties, such as Lu Jian, also depreciated by a few cents despite the scarcity of goods. The prices of various items fell together, and Dong Xin was reduced by another 20 cents. (North Shanghai) The supply came from Nos. 18 and 19, and the market was stomach-seeking. White Keng was sluggish, and the market prices of high-quality goods were unchanged, while medium and inferior grades were down by 10-20 cents. Early rice sales were stagnant, and prices were down by 20-30 cents. The flow of thin rice was good, and high-quality materials were still acceptable, while medium and inferior grades were slack. Market conditions were weak, with high prices down by a few cents and medium and inferior grades down by more than 20 cents. Large quantities of Dong Xin Keng arrived, but sales were average, and prices were down by 20 cents. More than 100 piculs of new Kunshan Datou Xian Rice arrived, and the quality was quite good. The price was set at nine yuan. New Kexian arrived in increasing quantities, but sales were sluggish, and prices were down by a few cents. The prices of other goods also showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Siamese Rice Waiting to be Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice remained stable. There were still profits at the end of the day, but they were not as strong as before. Only 184 bags of Yongjiang Ji Early Rice were opened yesterday, and they were distributed from this street to the interior. The stocks of old Kexian were scarce, but 70 bags of old Hunan Ji Yuan rice arrived from Hunan Province yesterday and were handled by Quanzhou, with a price of only 8.17 yuan. Because the digestion of Yuan rice is currently sluggish, and there are large quantities of Siamese rice compressing the market, the market is ultimately difficult to turn around. Siamese Yuan rice prices are as low as 8.25 yuan, and 150 bags were handled by Quanzhou yesterday. Foreign rice was gradually rising, but due to the weakening stomach of this street yesterday, the total market transaction was less than 2,000 bags. The domestic demand was limited. A total of 1,450 bags of Saigon, and over 1,000 bags of Siamese small grain, eggplant, chili, etc., were opened for the day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Needle-leaf Green Tea Sales to Europe Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market was slightly active. The needle-leaf green tea from the Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang routes was traded by companies such as Jardine Matheson, Tian Yu, Duddell, and Yongxing, and trading was not sluggish. Small quantities of Mazhu, Fengmei, and Emei varieties were also sold by American firms. However, the sales of Zhenmei remained sluggish, and the market may be difficult to stabilize. In addition, Jardine Matheson and Tianjin companies purchased more than 200 boxes of Qimen black tea, with prices ranging from 31 to 33 yuan, down another 3-4 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Still Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly tight as the interbank rate rose to 1.844. As a result, the trend was slightly tight. The publicly allocated prices for Group 24 granulated white sugar and Taikoo sugar and cotton white sugar were unchanged. However, because there were few Chaoqing goods available and the stocks in warehouses were low, the trend was very tight. Yesterday, Huanggang Qing was quoted at 10.5 yuan, and Gaolong Qing was quoted at 9.7 yuan, but no trades were made. The prices of Hainan Red Sugar were still one dime apart between sellers and buyers, and no transactions were made. The market sentiment gradually leveled off.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Wood Ear and Hunan Lotus Seed Prices Both Rise</h3>
<p>Previously, wood ear sales were slightly stagnant, and the price in Hankou was 88 yuan. However, recently, the appetite of various merchant groups has recovered, and the trend has suddenly tightened. According to news from Hankou yesterday, the price must be 92 yuan, up 4 yuan from before. High-quality wood ear is particularly in short supply. The previous price was 122.4 yuan, but now it is 131-132 yuan, up about 8 yuan. The price of Hunan lotus seeds has also been rebounding recently. According to telegrams from the producing area yesterday, Jiuxi lotus seeds have risen from about 31 yuan to 33 yuan, up about 2 yuan. The market is still expected to tighten further, and prices in Shanghai have also risen accordingly.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Qingdao Merchants Purchase Large Quantities of Tobacco Iron</h3>
<p>The Qingdao merchant groups have been frantically purchasing three to ten sheets of 36-inch tobacco iron in recent days, with the total amount purchased reaching over 700 piculs. As a result, the market price has been rising steadily, reaching 7.35 yuan per picul, up another 20 cents from before. The Tianjin tobacco companies have also been making many purchases, so there are many inquiries in the market. However, according to investigations, the stock is very low. If there are no more arrivals within the month, there is a risk of a shortage.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Speaking of Gu Hongming's Brutishness</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih wrote an article "Remembering Gu Hongming" in the Literary Supplement of the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao. He told us a little anecdote about Mr. Gu Hongming. From anecdotes, one can see a person's true nature. Therefore, although that article was not long, it clearly brought out Mr. Gu's character, including his brutishness, onto the paper. This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Hongming's brutishness is known throughout the world. Now, Mr. Hu Shih is willing to extract some old stories from his memory and collect the brutish air to provide some evidence, which is naturally more outstanding.</p>
<p>And we really want to see this outstanding brutishness.</p>
<p>The anecdotes recorded by Mr. Hu that best show Gu Hongming's brutishness are a few paragraphs about his queue. It is said that when Gu Hongming was about to go abroad, he received strict instructions from his father not to cut off his queue. So when he arrived in Scotland, he endured humiliation, but still let the "pig tail" remain behind his head, but later he finally cut it off and gave it to a "knowing" girl. After that, he became a "fake foreign devil." It was not until the Xinhai Revolution that he kept it again, but he wore a fake queue, running around in a carriage, and the "pig tail" made a big splash.</p>
<p>After the Republic of China, he still never forgot that queue. On Zhang Dong's birthday, he sent a couplet that read: "When the lotus is gone, there is no umbrella to hold the rain; when the chrysanthemums are withered, there are still branches to brave the frost." It is said that the umbrella is the Qing Dynasty's big hat, and the frost-resistant branches are the queues of the old gentleman himself and Marshal Zhang.</p>
<p>While others were making revolution, he revered the king. While others were cutting their hair, he dragged his queue. This is called brutishness, which people in Zhejiang and Jiangsu do not understand very much. Because this kind of behavior, in the eyes of people in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, is stubbornness. Brutishness can be good or bad, but stubbornness is bad no matter what.</p>
<p>People in Jiangsu and Zhejiang like to drop literary bags, but they do not like to stretch out their fists. This is true on the whole. But the result of stretching out the fist can be kowtowing; although dropping literary bags is too lacking in warrior spirit, it can still have barbarous spirit. For example, many of the protagonists in the Qing Dynasty's literary inquisition were from Zhejiang. If Gu Hongming is compared to Lu Wancun, then the chasm between them is very vast, and everyone can understand it.</p>
<p>Also, in August of the thirty-ninth year of Qianlong, an edict was issued to seek out lost books. The edict said:</p>
<p>There are many people who made unofficial histories during the Ming Dynasty. Among them, praises are arbitrary, and rumors spread strange words. There must be words that slander this dynasty. It is right to investigate and handle this time and destroy them all, to stop evil words, to correct people's hearts and thicken customs, and it is definitely not appropriate to leave it unhandled. Such matters of reckless discussion in writing are mostly found in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, and Guangdong may also be unavoidable. How can we not carefully investigate?</p>
<p>In the fifty-seventh year of Qianlong, it was again decreed:</p>
<p>...Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces are relatively large and have always been known as the source of human culture. There are many books among the people, so the reason why they cannot be completely banned is that the governors and governors treat them as trivial matters....</p>
<p>Hongli's special attention to Jiangsu and Zhejiang was not without reason. There are, after all, few guys who talk about roundness and misunderstand humor among the literati of Zhejiang and Jiangsu; most of the literati of Zhejiang and Jiangsu still have a bit of brutishness, and are not easily entered into the shell, such as Fang Xiaoru, Gu Yanwu, and Jin Shengtan, and those who actually did it, just to discuss the end of the Ming Dynasty, there are still Zhang Cangshui, Wu Risheng, Chen Wozi, and Xia Kaogong, etc. They simply cannot settle for being literati, but they are literati.</p>
<p>This is because of brutishness.</p>
<p>But what about Gu Hongming? Praising bound feet, keeping his queue, parading through the streets, we only see his weirdness, comicality, and pitifulness, and what else?</p>
<h3>One Night</h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>I remember that night the rain was falling very fast. A sound like ten thousand horses galloping intensified the rain.</p>
<p>I was sitting on a rattan chair, listening to the rain. It was already very late. I looked down at the beast-like city under our windows, but I only saw a deep, abyss-like darkness.</p>
<p>Sleep overcame my struggles. Even though a friend who shared the bed with me was still outside, I fell heavily onto the large wooden bed and fell asleep vaguely.</p>
<p>But I quickly woke up again. I heard the strange sound of opening the door and taking up an umbrella.</p>
<p>"Who is it? Is it Afang?"</p>
<p>"No, it's Lao Xu."</p>
<p>It was a soft, hoarse answer. Mixed in with this uncomfortable sound was a fitful cough.</p>
<p>"Why did you come so late at night?" I asked angrily. I was really a little annoyed by this poor friend. In fact, he was Afang's friend, and not very close to me. But every time he came, he would mooch off us, either borrowing money or eating. Didn't he understand that I was also having a hard time?</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten all day, and I have to run... it's really..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he quickly dragged the rice pot from under our bench, scooped out a large bowl of cold rice, sprinkled some salt on it, and ate it just like that.</p>
<p>"Is there any boiled water?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer.</p>
<p>"It would be best if you could lend me five copper coins to buy some fried peanuts to eat with the rice."</p>
<p>I stubbornly kept silent, almost deliberately. A feeling of contempt, like pity, agitated me, making me unable to be quiet. I had just come out of school at that time, and had not yet tasted the bitterness of life. I always expressed suspicion and contempt for this kind of friend who, as soon as he opened his mouth, said that he had not eaten for several days.</p>
<p>"Have you really not eaten for two days?"</p>
<p>I asked him maliciously, using the attitude and tone of treating a beggar, as if I really had a vile and shameless beggar standing in front of me.</p>
<p>He looked up in surprise. His confused expression aroused my anger even more. I spat and rubbed the floor hard with my feet, saying:</p>
<p>"You're lying, you haven't eaten for two days! Humph, a person isn't made of straw, how could they go hungry for two days?"</p>
<p>I saw his pair of dead fish-like eyes quickly blurring, and his pair of thin hands seemed to be twitching.</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>He suddenly put down the rice bowl, rolled up his sleeves, rolling them all the way up to his arms, which were as thin as wheat stalks, as if he was about to explode with rage at me. But a dark, tolerant smile quickly flashed across his face. He smiled and said:</p>
<p>"No, you still don't understand anything, punk! You will never understand at the moment, that a person starving for a few days, having nothing to eat except a little boiled water, is not a lie that I made up. You won't understand, but life will slowly make you believe..."</p>
<p>But I snorted, unwilling to agree. He raised his right hand again, which was as thin as a straw, and held the rice bowl, devouring the second bowl of cold rice greedily.</p>
<p>After finishing the meal, he spread some old newspapers in a corner of the room. He knew my temper and that I would never give him a blanket after quarreling with him, even though it was already very cold. So he slept on those old newspapers, wrapping his own torn jacket tightly around his upper body and stomach, while his lower body was still covered with layers of old newspapers.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to wait for my other friend to come back to try to get him some covering, but fatigue overcame the cold. After tossing and turning for a short time, he fell asleep with a snore.</p>
<p>But I sat precariously on the bed, listening to the rain with annoyance and a little shame.</p>
<h3>Porter</h3>
<p>— Tianji</p>
<h3>Waiting</h3>
<p>— Chu Yaming</p>
<p>Once, Tungtong Village produced a general, which made the entire village very proud. However, three years before I went there, that general had already died. Some of the troops under his command had been disbanded, and some, apart from two or three officers who had held lucrative posts and were now building Western-style houses and marrying concubines, many villagers had become unemployed vagrants. Initially, they were willing to cultivate fields and grow vegetables, but later they completely changed their ways and became bandits, engaging in theft and robbery.</p>
<p>There was a woman who perpetually existed among these bandits and the rest of the farming families. Depending on the different customs of each, her name was called in various ways. The most common were Second Sister-in-law Wu, Fourth Sister-in-law Liang, Sister-in-law Li Xiang, and Crazy Woman... Her original name, no one could remember anymore.</p>
<p>The local militia often caught notorious bandits in her house, but they did not harm her, as if she was linked to the history of the rise and fall of Tungtong Village, and thus she also became sacred. The bandits did not say a word about her, even refusing to answer whether they knew her; the farmers swore in the market that they had never given her a penny, and all the benefits were only her bestowal.</p>
<p>Regarding her past, I only knew a little bit.</p>
<p>Her first husband was called Wu Lao Er, a shameless man who often beat her and forced her into prostitution.</p>
<p>At that time, she was still very young. A camp of soldiers was stationed in a poor people's hospital—they supported Wu Lao Er and his wife. Liang Biao and Li Xiang often stood guard at the camp gate. They wore cotton coats sewn by inferior craftsmen, the gray twill fabric worn into patches of "black rainbow," emitting a sour and musty smell; without socks, feet like sweet potatoes were unwillingly stuffed into straw sandals; hats were worn crookedly, and they carried long rifles with bayonets. The blood on their faces, in winter, was chased away by the cold, turning "blue-chicken" like, snot running down for no reason, and teeth chattering.</p>
<p>It was on a very cold day that Wu Lao Er severely beat his wife. Li Xiang couldn't bear it any longer, dropped his gun while on duty, and ran to the hut to punish Wu Lao Er. As a result, he lost his job. But more unfortunately, at that time Wu Lao Er had already given his wife to Liang Biao. Their condition was that Liang Biao would give half of his salary to Wu Lao Er every month for three years. She tried various ways to pester Wu Lao Er, but he explained it this way: if he didn't sell her, she would eventually run away with a man anyway. After that, the tall and sturdy "Bull Demon" Li Xiang, who often touched his nose when speaking, disappeared.</p>
<p>After Liang Biao bought his wife, he also lost his job because of fighting with others. At first, he accommodated the woman in every way. Later, they gradually started arguing. He said his woman was a "tomb curse," that any man who touched her would be jinxed. In the morning, he boiled sweet potatoes, in the afternoon he sold mung bean soup or glutinous rice porridge, and at night he stayed overnight at the Land God Temple. Only on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month did he return to the hut to sleep, and on other days he told her to find her own way to earn money.</p>
<p>Once, a large group of soldiers passed through Tungtong Village. No one could accurately identify the names, types, or numbers of those troops. They called them "Divine Soldiers." Mai Yuan, an old and ugly orchard craftsman, began to boldly inquire about news from those divine soldiers—and immediately discovered his old friend, Li Xiang, who had previously been stationed in Tungtong Village. Li Xiang made many people in the village feel great joy. They invited him to eat, drink, gamble, and entertained him in various ways.</p>
<p>The next day, Li Xiang killed Liang Biao and left with the large troop. From that time on, the prostitute asked others to call her Sister-in-law Li Xiang—a glorious, happy name.</p>
<p>"Only he truly loves me," she said to everyone. "He promised to come back soon, he will come back soon!"</p>
<p>"But war is hard to predict..."</p>
<p>"How dare you curse him, you black-hearted dog!"</p>
<p>She cleaned the hut very carefully every day, put on neat clothes, and washed her soul clean and white. She forbade idlers and noisy stray dogs from approaching her hut, and when driving them away or beating them, she often mentioned Li Xiang's name to scare them.</p>
<p>When I met her, she was only thirty-two or thirty-three years old. Her eyes were large and deep, her physique was large and strong, and she looked like a powerful woman. But she was actually very gentle and docile. The radiance emanating from her, as if to melt everything, attracted me to approach her. Beside her, I became younger than my age, and at the same time more sensible, more obedient, and happier.</p>
<p>"You know how to read? That's great," she said. "A woman should have this ability. If I knew how to read, I could write letters!"</p>
<p>"I can write for you."</p>
<p>"You can? You can't! I want to write something, think about it. There is such a heart in the world: first, it is chopped into pieces with a knife, making it a pile of minced meat, throwing a little here, throwing a little there, no one feels sorry for it!... Later, it is found from all the corners, pieced together, injected with blood, let it grow, and grow even bigger than before..." She said, holding her head with great effort.</p>
<p>Sometimes she advised me like this:</p>
<p>"Do something, when you grow up, do something! A woman is only considered a pile of cow dung, let them see! Difficult, dirty, uncomfortable, sometimes are not bad, create your own world."</p>
<p>People in the village knew that she had many "lovers," but they could not pinpoint the names. I have never seen any. I only often saw her alone, wearing pure black clothes, hiding in the woods, singing some popular short songs in a low voice in the early morning or at dusk.</p>

<h3>Love (II)</h3>
<p>— By S. Sergeyev-Tsensky, translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>He had read this in some book, and remembered it as a very useful thing to say on this kind of occasion. Sentences and words of this kind always seemed extraordinarily true and particularly appealing to him. And, if he knew more of this kind of thing, he would tell Aliosha.</p>
<p>But the short, gaunt Aliosha looked up at his huge, astonished face, and suddenly laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! Kolt, and love! Hahaha!"</p>
<p>Those dazzlingly white, even teeth, the light radiating from her laughing, wrinkled eyes! Still laughing, she walked past him. Although there was no one around, Sawaka stood there for a long time without moving. It was as if a stone was in his throat, blocking his breath. He clenched his teeth, his gray, unfriendly eyes stared at the ground, and a sound rang in his ears, as if the whole village of Spask was laughing at him.</p>
<p>When he finally dragged his legs home, he said, gnashing his teeth, "Good, you girl. You have a red head, but a black heart."</p>
<p>It was a clear day in early spring. The wind was blowing, the rooftops were whistling, and the swallows were chirping crisply.</p>
<p>Two days later, Sawaka said to his sick father: "The ice is melting. If you're happy, I'll take you to the town by boat. They say there's a good hospice there now. Maybe they'll heal you quickly."</p>
<p>His father often wore skis to the forest in winter to hunt deer. He did not bring his deer back, but after two weeks, he drove a reindeer, carrying meat and hides. The last time, he drove with great difficulty, without stopping, but that reindeer was originally a bad one. Too tired to walk in the snow, it refused to eat hay, and refused to be examined. It began to use its antlers to touch his father. His father managed to insert a small knife into its throat, and then dragged his feet home. But he was seriously ill, and everyone noticed this. It was clear that this deer was his last.</p>
<p>The town was downstream of the river, five hundred kilometers away! This is almost nothing in Siberia. The father agreed to go to the hospital. Sawaka's brother! Prokhor, had been married with two children! Now the whole family was on him alone. He looked at Sawaka searchingly, and then looked at his father worriedly, but did not object. So Sawaka began to clean his rifle, oiled it, prepared gunpowder and heavy bullets, sharpened his axe, and collected everything needed to make fire and catch fish. He put some millet in one bag, salt in another, and salted meat in the third.</p>

<h3>A "No" and Three "And then Only"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The Paris Tripartite Conference to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, although several diplomats had held many focused discussions, was finally completely thwarted on the 18th by a "no" from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in a phone call. A communique of just a few lines signed by Laval, Eden, and Aloisi declared it dead. The only hope of averting war will be a final effort at the League of Nations Executive Council on September 4. Mussolini's "no" has a very significant impact on the safety of the world situation.</p>
<p>However, Mussolini's "no" is still a passive expression. Besides this "no," he also has two "and then only" statements. This kind of active tone allows you to see his determination. Mussolini said in a speech to 12,000 members of the 23rd Division in Isernia the other day: "We should advance bravely, until the fascist empire is established, and I know that you will do your best with iron discipline, each fulfilling your duties, until all goals are achieved." To establish a fascist empire and achieve all goals – aren't these two "and then only" statements even more severe than the previous "no"? Here, Mussolini's ambition is clearly expressed. It is now heard that Italy has decided to invade Ethiopia in October. Even if the League of Nations Executive Council has the power to reverse the situation, it may be difficult to save this imminent crisis.</p>
<p>However, although Ethiopia is weak, it is by no means to be underestimated. Ethiopian King Haile Selassie recently made a statement to a British reporter, in which he said: "Our country wishes to live in peace, and we sincerely hope that war will not break out between Italy and our country. However, if we are truly forced into this situation and disaster strikes, then for the sake of safeguarding freedom, we must prepare to resist until the last person." This "and then only" is Ethiopia's determination to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>The mediation of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is now in a stalemate due to Mussolini's "no." Regarding the future development of the situation, Italy will inevitably use two "and then only" statements to conquer Ethiopia, and Ethiopia will also inevitably use one "and then only" statement to resist Italy. This is an inevitable result of the Italian-Ethiopian stalemate.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Early Autumn</h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>I can't think of any time in my twenty-odd years that was happier than the three autumns from the ages of thirteen to sixteen.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was weak and couldn't stand the heat, so in the summer, I didn't eat much and was pitifully thin, looking like I was sick. But as soon as autumn arrived, I was like an autumn eagle that came with the autumn wind, soaring lightly in the crisp, clear sky.</p>
<p>Autumn in the countryside is truly a season of maturity: peaches and melons, although at the end of their strength, but clusters of purple grapes are already垂垂的成熟(垂垂的成熟 is literally drooping, but that does not make sense in English here, so 'almost ripe' is used). At that time, I ate a lot of everything to compensate for the losses of summer, and the adults knew I was pitiful, so as long as I didn't go too far, they wouldn't stop me.</p>
<p>At that time, we didn't pay attention to seasons like "Beginning of Autumn," nor did we think that the first day of the seventh lunar month was the beginning of autumn. For us, autumn began on the seventh day of the seventh month. The seventh day of the seventh month is the "Qixi Festival." On that day, the sisters happily dyed their fingernails red and prayed for skills and made flower shoes. Because "Qixi" is "Girls' Day," there was nothing for us boys to do, but at that time, I was equally happy about the arrival of Qixi, because once Qixi arrived, not only was the weather cool, but the fifteenth day of the seventh month, which we had been looking forward to since the beginning of summer, would come soon after Qixi.</p>
<p>The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Ghost Festival, or Zhongyuan Festival. In our countryside, it was inevitable to hold a Taoist ritual, the so-called Ullambana Festival.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai who are used to seeing Taoist rituals in the alleys always think that our countryside's Ullambana Festival is just like that; in fact, this concept is completely wrong. From the tenth day of the seventh month, the young people in our countryside would start preparing to make paper ghosts, find a place, donate money, and hire people. On the fourteenth day, a small boat stopped by the river, and a group of people playing shifan music came out of the boat. Then another small boat came, and twelve Taoist priests walked out of the boat. Finally, another small boat stopped, and twelve monks slowly walked out. By this time, their accommodations had already been decided. The three groups went to their respective accommodations to rest for a while, and then gathered at a nearby temple (probably where the monks lived) and everyone dressed up. At the same time, many young people had already brought over the various paper ghosts and flags they had made. After the Taoist priests and monks dressed up, they came out in formation, with sheng and drums playing together, and even the Taoist priests knocked on many obscure instruments. They started from the temple and walked on several larger roads for a while before heading towards the erected altar. There were two altars, facing each other, with monks and Taoist priests each occupying one altar. In the middle of the two altars was a bamboo pole about two zhang (about 6.6 meters) high, with a banner of summoning souls on top. The banner hung straight down from the top of the bamboo pole, about one zhang three or four chi (about 4.3 to 4.7 meters) long. At night, the banner of summoning souls would be replaced by a string of nine summoning lamps. At that time, I followed the monks and Taoist priests closely, starting from the temple, walking on several main roads, and then to the altar. Once they were on the altar, they each set up and organized the things they needed, which was nothing to see. Since it was around sunset, I hurried back home, ate dinner haphazardly, and then ran to the altar to watch.</p>
<p>Around eight o'clock, the ritual began. The monks were, as usual, skillfully chanting the Liang Emperor Repentance Sutra, and also summoned various ghosts and released food and drink. The Taoist priests, on the other hand, were completely different. They performed plays: such as little ghosts fighting each other, Mulian saving his mother, and picking up gold, etc. All with the monks chanting energetically, they would act energetically. Naturally, at this time, all the audience under the stage turned to the Taoist priests' altar, and the monks could only chant sutras to the backs of the audience. Even the monks themselves felt bored, so they struck the bell, and the whole team stood up. The audience also turned around when they suddenly stood up. The monks seized this opportunity and did not let go. A monk "split the drum," which is to throw the copper drum in the instruments into the air, from one piece to two pieces, and finally to four pieces, and another monk catches them alternately with both hands. It is said that this trick is not easy. If you are not careful, it will either fall to the ground or break your hand. Although this is the case, the monks had fewer tricks, and the audience mostly faced the Taoist priests.</p>
<h3>Liuniao Bay</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>As the boat approached Liuniao Bay, the sky, which had been wearing a mourning face for half a day, finally tore through its dark skin. A burst of raindrops the size of fists fell like a floodgate had opened, and the southwest wind blew harder and harder. The small boat pitched and tossed, causing the sailors to hurry and panic. The captain stood on the bow of the boat like a stone statue, his experienced eyes scanning the sky, calmly directing the sailors. The lives and property of the entire ship were entirely entrusted to his command. The boat reluctantly moved along the coastline, and the captain finally ordered the boat to stop. He said that under the current circumstances, it would be impossible to reach the provincial capital tonight. Ahead was Liuniao Bay, where they might be able to find a charitable inn sooner. The anxious passengers looked at each other. Most of them were merchants, and time was extremely valuable in their eyes; if the boat could reach the provincial capital tonight, the benefits to their business would be incalculable. Now that the boat was anchored in Liuniao Bay, the raindrops fell madly, and the waves in the river rose wildly at the same time. It was unknown how long this unexpected storm would last. However, the captain had ordered the boat to anchor for the sake of the lives and property of the entire ship; therefore, these passengers could only remain silent, planning their whereabouts for the night.</p>
<p>Once the boat was anchored at the Liuniao Bay wharf, the passengers who had rain gear disembarked one after another, hoping to find a place to eat and spend the night before it got completely dark. I dazedly mingled in their ranks, because it was my first time traveling this route, and I was unfamiliar with everything. I later learned that it often happened that this ship would anchor overnight halfway. Those who traveled often knew where there were restaurants and inns at a certain wharf.</p>
<p>The rain made a loud noise on the umbrellas, and the wind was even more urgent. My lower body was soaked as if I had just been dragged out of the river. I wanted to use the umbrella to block the oncoming wind, but I was afraid of blinding myself and not being able to see the people in front of me, causing me to get lost. The streets of Liuniao Bay were uneven stone roads, and the puddles of water often completely soaked my leather shoes. There were no electric lights here, and the streetlights were like will-o'-the-wisps. The distance between the streetlights was very long, and even the person walking in front of me was just a black shadow swaying in the distance. But I didn't dare to speak. Those people were walking silently, turning down several narrow streets. It seemed like there were chaotic sounds ahead, so I raised my head and saw a huge lantern hanging not far from me, with the words "Inn" in bright red letters shining in the candlelight. At that moment, I didn't care about the puddles under my feet and quickened my pace to catch up. When I reached the inn and put down my umbrella, I realized that there were quite a few people following behind me.</p>
<p>The inn also operated a restaurant. Upon entering, there was a large dining hall with a dozen tables lined up quietly under a dim kerosene lamp. I guessed that this inn was exclusively for travelers like us; later, a young waiter told me that their business was completely uncertain. Passenger ships rarely docked in Liuniao Bay. Only those who traveled overland to the provincial capital would stop here for a meal. Therefore, they were busy for only a few days, and sometimes they couldn't do any business for several months.</p>
<p>These unexpected guests rushed into the dining hall. Familiar groups each occupied a table, but strangers were also welcome to sit down. This kind of enthusiasm could only be encountered on a journey. Everyone just nodded to each other and started talking at length, forgetting all about their plans for what to do after arriving in the provincial capital.</p>
<p>The young waiter suddenly became flustered. He seemed a little at a loss, going from table to table, yawning. Perhaps they hadn't anticipated this business.</p>
<p>The dozen or so tables were in a hubbub. Some were knocking on the tables, and some were shouting for the waiter with the accent of the provincial capital. The heavy rain had been completely forgotten by the people.</p>
<h3>New Poems of the Bamboo Forest</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>I read about the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove in ancient books. At that time, my naive mind was so envious of that kind of tranquil life and leisurely state of mind. I approached and worshipped the noble and pure personalities of those seven sages with a sincere heart.</p>
<p>Because of this, I developed a special interest in the bamboo garden behind my mountain. Although now that I think about it, it was a detached and ridiculous foolishness, at the time, the virtuous style of "mountains high and waters long" did indeed leave an indelible mark on my mind.</p>
<p>I was especially enchanted by the bamboo forest during the long summer days. Near noon, I would carry a bamboo bed on my shoulder and choose a shady spot to sleep. The mountain breeze brushed through the clusters of bamboo leaves, and the crisp sound merged into the calm surface of the water. Then, a special force-like cool breeze, carrying a faint fragrance, attacked my side, washing away even the vulgar dust in my heart. There, I seemed to truly approach the essence of nature. I heard her breathing, I saw her smile. On every pointed bamboo leaf, I found their different faces. In every bird's laughter, I understood their different needs. I handed my heart over to nature like an old monk who had entrusted his heart to the gods. I got the true energy of heaven and earth. I was as great as heaven and earth, and felt that the seven sages of ancient times were still just a bunch of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Hunger and cold drove me away from my hometown for more than ten years, and the prosperity and decline of the bamboo garden were no longer my concern. According to a letter from my father, because of the flood, the bamboo had been turned into food. Ah, I understand, only with food can one enjoy leisure, and only then can one become a virtuous scholar of "mountains high and waters long!"</p>
<h3>Prophet?</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>From dawn to dusk, apart from the deep night, when a single lamp burns quietly and all else is still, which holds the richest taste of tranquility, the short afternoon nap can be considered worthy of praise. The charm of the afternoon nap lies in its quietude, without the desolation of deep night. It carries a relaxed and cheerful flavor within its tranquility, yet it doesn’t resemble the weariness and desolation of late evening. The sky, drifting clouds, shade of the trees, sound of cicadas, and even the crowing of the rooster, all abound with the seduction of a gentle sleepiness, urging people to generously set aside their pressing work in pursuit of a brief respite. In the late night, when work has exhausted the spirit, a cigarette or a cup of coffee can be employed to adapt to its stimulating properties as much as possible; the afternoon nap is an exception. The allure of smoke, instead, aids in calming the mood, leisurely carrying the aroused physical strength and tides of thought into a realm of serenity and deep sleepiness within the soft, misty smoke. Everything feels complete; one forgets the surrounding world, everything that might tense up the tides of thought, as if resting on a soft, drifting cloud, feeling only the existence of oneself. The world seems to fall into an atmosphere of dreams.</p>
<p>To properly grasp the sentiment of this short afternoon nap, I often carefully restrain myself, not easily allowing my spirit to relax to its utmost point and peacefully fall asleep. At this time, I open my heart and set aside all activities that might tire my body and mind. My bed is close to the open window, and lying on the pillow, I can see the expanse of the clear blue sky outside the window. The crowing of the rooster from the neighboring courtyard easily leads one into a sleepy state. Beyond that, everything seems lazy and quiet; a wonderful sense of relaxation envelops and intoxicates my body and mind. Emotions return to a state of purity, eliminating all resentment towards life. Then, a tranquil mood reopens the floodgates of thought, and many subtle truths, old memories, and beautiful fantasies, like white clouds in the vast sky, gently float across my eyes with a calming and serene air. If true daydreams exist in life, then their realm should be like this. Because genuine dreams inevitably carry a heavy color and astringent taste to some extent.</p>
<p>I have never neglected my fondness for clouds. This, too, can only occur when the mind is idle and the spirit is calm. The mood of the afternoon nap is, of course, most suitable for cloud-watching. Although the clouds of late evening are more magnificent, they are also more changeable, which should be left for children to appreciate and praise. Those who have tasted the bitterness of life and weathered the storms of living seem to have mostly lost their sense of curiosity, which in turn can cause emotions to divert into negative, sharp corners. How jarring it would be if, for the sake of cloud-watching, one were to erupt into a mournful sigh of "white clouds, grey dogs"! When I lean on my pillow, what faces my vision is the high, distant sky, with wisps of clouds floating on a deep blue background, moving without haste, gentle, pure, innocent, charming; the mood is ethereal and beautiful, making one's heart bright and clear, yet graceful and fleeting. Gradually, the chirping of cicadas and the distant crowing of roosters also sink faintly in my ears, sink, sink... I finally fall asleep in the caress of the afternoon breeze that comes through the forest and across the water.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Dream of the Red Chamber Tunes" (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the first month, plum blossoms bloom, a sprig of zero. Pepper flowers offer praise, celebrating New Spring. Who can compete at the Rong Mansion banquet? Silver candles, autumn light, chill the painted screen. Lantern Festival night, appreciating lanterns. The whole world rejoices, celebrating peace and prosperity. Mandarin ducks cleverly make ivory tablets. If only a poet could capture it until now. Intoxicated by the east wind, the second month is long. Fragrant flowers bloom in Yingchun Xuan. Deep courtyard beauties idly pluck grass. Daubing fresh red on the Shanghai crabapple. Heads full of emerald, hands full of fragrance. Imperial Terrace spring scenery is unparalleled. Ten thousand purples and thousands of reds are worthy of painting. Poets put down their pens, finding it difficult to praise. In the third month of Wu Ling, little peach blossoms are red. Where does Tanchun fish for duckweed traces? The sun is warm, the fragrant grass is green. Leaning on a cane, supporting me over the bridge east. Luan pierces swallows, butterflies accompany bees. Jade intertwined branches have exquisite shadows. The flower fragrance assaults the senses, knowing books are warm. The willows gently brush the face, not feeling cold. In the fourth month, flowers wither, sorrowfully leaning on the railing. When will Xichun return? Fallen reds fill the ground, no one sweeps. Scattering path, willow catkins pave a white carpet. The wind flutters, the sun is beautiful. A long day like a year, partridge sky. Sitting alone, embracing a zither, singing a song. Stealing a half-day of leisure. In the fifth month, pomegranates bloom, scattering remnants of sunset clouds. Xifeng arrives, with auspicious clouds covering her. Innate beauty is difficult for others to match. Plums leave sourness, splashing the teeth. Talent surpasses the masses, appearance is worthy of praise. A branch of spring occupies ten points of splendor. Jade bracelets clang, making clear sounds. Banana trees divide green on the window screen. In the sixth month, weary, too lazy to paint eyebrows. Ice silk fan brushes the face, held in hand. Thick shade, green trees, cicada sounds buzz. Mountain colors are hazy, rain is also strange. Newly bathed, the evening breeze is gentle. Pearl curtains rolled up, the setting sun is west. Lin Zhao Xiang Ling releases flowers. A pool of clear water can soak a poem's spleen. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Chapter (Afraid of His Wife)</p>
<p>When a man and woman marry, becoming a couple. Mutual respect should be the proper way. Only for that, love is misused and becomes fear. Letting the wife's power expand. "Afraid of my wife" are the three words people say. Those who fear their wives have the same tone. Upon hearing a lion's roar, they shudder in fear. From then on, it's difficult to assert husbandly authority. The husband is a servant in every way. Obeying orders without being able to resist. Sometimes serving rice and pouring soup. Sometimes folding blankets and folding clothes. Coming to hold the child in vain. Carefully serving without opposing in the least. Always, saying yes repeatedly, standing by. Like that, fragrant flowers are offered to the female Bodhisattva. Surely, the kneeling cushion has changed direction. It's hateful that the winter nights are too long. Sometimes they even have to kneel by the pond. Luckily, they've already cut their hair, avoiding dressing. Strict orders, without sentiment. Breaking the rules, they are chased off the bed. Who knows that after marrying, the husband serves? The tigress's fame is far and wide. Therefore, he doesn't dare. Come play in the amusement park. He doesn't dare. Play poker and mahjong. He doesn't dare. Accompany dancing girls to dance. He doesn't dare. Casually tidy his clothes and step into a peaceful world. He doesn't dare. Hide beauty in a golden house, running a shelter. He doesn't also. Stop his wife, remarrying, abandoning his former wife. It's not that he's naturally afraid of the shrew. He bows down, the qi of the qipao descends. He often obeys the laws of the domestic affairs office. Waiting on this, tiny, delicate female jade emperor. Sometimes, an imperial decree grants him a dream. The eastern river suddenly becomes a gentle village. It's often said that fearing one's wife brings wealth. If you want to deceive your wife, it's difficult to be well-off. However. It's difficult to endure the suffering of one's heart. He knows. Strengthening his muscles and bones makes him strong. Therefore. Moving benches is just an ordinary matter. Juggling lights is even more of a specialty. If. Relatives and friends encounter celebrations. The skill has been practiced in the boudoir. It's also fine for a visiting scholar to perform. I hope you all won't laugh. He is. Imitating Chen Jichang of the Song dynasty. Wanting. Blue to surpass indigo is when there is light.</p>

<h3>Freedom God Special</h3>
<p>Theme Song</p>
<p>The theme song of "Freedom God" was composed by Shi Yi and set to music by Lü Ji. In the play, it is sung by Chen Hangsu (played by Wang Ying), a female soldier at the rally of the Northern Expedition army and civilians. At the end of each verse, there is a chorus of thousands of people, and at the end of the film, there is a chorus of children in distress, performed voluntarily by more than 100 children from the Hongkou China Benevolent and Educational Institution for Orphans. The performance is excellent. The lyrics are tragic and clear. It has now been reviewed and approved by the Central Propaganda Committee. The original lyrics are recorded below: (Music scores can be obtained by sending two fen in postage stamps)</p>
<p>Farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, everyone is of one mind!</p>
<p>Regardless of male or female, let's work together towards the future.</p>
<p>Let's not forget our mission of national salvation.</p>
<p>We are the masters of China!</p>
<p>Masters of China! Masters of China!</p>
<p>Don't long for your shattered hometown;</p>
<p>Don't cherish your empty dreams;</p>
<p>Press down on your wounds; stand up straight;</p>
<p>Fight back our nation's freedom, liberation!</p>
<p>Freedom, liberation! Freedom, liberation!</p>
<p>Put on the armor of will;</p>
<p>Step into the battlefield of life;</p>
<p>Hold up the knives and guns of self-defense;</p>
<p>Stop the enemy's arrogance;</p>
<p>Fight back our nation's freedom, liberation!</p>
<p>China has broken through its black and boundless night;</p>
<p>The people have tempered their will into steel;</p>
<p>The future has shown the hope of light;</p>
<p>Look! Look at the beacon of self-salvation, burning all around.</p>
<p>The above theme song has been recorded by Pathé Records, sung by Ms. Wang Ying. Both the film and the record are accompanied by the French Labor Department Orchestra, conducted by Mr. Sloutsky.</p>
<p>Worth Remembering:</p>
<p>Dian Tong's new film "Freedom God" is a brief account of the historical facts of the National Revolution. In addition to spending a lot of time and effort on customs and props, striving for authenticity, there are also one or two coincidences and memorable events in the war:</p>
<p>(1) Three years ago, the outbreak of a certain war in Shanghai created many orphans without parents or homes. They are still living a displaced life, and they are now the children of the Hongkou Benevolent and Educational Institution for Orphans. The children in distress in the war zone in "Freedom God" happen to be played by them. They have been without their parents' love for a long time, and they have also been without the joy of family life for a long time. Although they are young, they also know that this is acting, but it is clearly a scene that they personally experienced three years ago, and a group of innocent hearts are also a little saddened.</p>
<p>(2) The soldiers of the Central Aviation School's covering battalion, some of whom participated in the Northern Expedition, were invited to reenact a glorious revolutionary historical event in "Freedom God." They are still as brave as they were on the front line in those years, shedding blood and risking their heads. Although it is acting, they are still very excited in spirit.</p>
<p>Zhou Boxun</p>
<p>Zhou Boxun has been active on the screen for many years. The roles he plays, especially the comprador class, are played most thoughtfully, and the local tyrants and evil gentry are also done very appropriately. However, after he finished playing "Peach and Plum Tribulation," the directors of Dian Tong persuaded him to reform and become a "good man" in his style. Now, Dian Tong's new film "Freedom God," which is about to be released, has been screened several times, and many people have said in unison after watching it that Zhou Boxun has changed and become more skilled. Audiences, this is his first performance after changing his style. What will it be like? You can meet him at the Jin Cheng soon.</p>
<p>Yang Jiming</p>
<p>Yang Jiming, the photographer of "Freedom God" and the owner of Carlton Photo Studio, is thin, capable, and meticulous. He is cautious, hardworking, and willing to work hard. He has many English and Japanese photography books and publications. Usually, in addition to exploring fun in books, he often uses a camera as a toy to play various games. Therefore, all his energy can be said to be completely consumed in photography. Since serving as the photographer for Situ Huimin's "Freedom God," although his life has been exceptionally busy, he is particularly excited to have this opportunity to put his years of theory and experience into practice. According to him, in addition to dead books and rigid mirror boxes, this time he has seen many active materials. Although "Freedom God" is his first attempt, he has carefully researched and painstakingly planned on the set, bringing the lighting, angles, and positions to perfection. This struggling newcomer in the camera world has shown his infinite hope in the success of "Freedom God."</p>
