<p>（南京）中央九日晨八時舉行總理第一次起義紀念會、出席中委注兆銘、葉楚傖·居正·戴傳賢·洪陸東·周啟剛·馬超俊·黃慕松·傅汝霖·羅家倫·焦易堂·陳策·李宗黃·及黨部工作人員暨國府林主及各處官長宮各機關代表等七百餘人由常委汪兆銘主席、羅家倫報告、其原詞如下、</p>
<p>四十一年前的今日、總理本着大下已飢、天下已溺的惻隱之心、想救中國民族出水火而登諾袵席、於是在廣州作第一次的起義、不幸失敗、先烈陸皓東朱貴全邱四三烈士死難、但是革命運動的基礎、隨以確立、當時總理還不過三十歲、是以純粹靑年的精神和熱血、來貫澈他這種救國救民的主張、現在四十一年過去了、中華民國的成立也已經二十四年了、環顧同胞、還在天災人禍水深火熱之中、我們在紀念總理的時候、實在覺得痛心、凡是革命的同志、沒有不自已反躬自責的、今天兄弟奉中央常會之命、對於救災問題、先有所報告、這次水災嚴重、不亞於民國二十年、而其範圍的廣闊、尤有過之、全國最大的三條幹河、黃河揚子江珠江、乎同時出險、尤以黃河揚子江兩河流域。災最甚、因　上　的大雨、和襄河的　　　　　一帶、大部份都已陸沉、因爲伊洛　河的暴漲黃河在豫魯一帶、决口　出、　積極防水的工作、也抵不住那奔於的黃　、所以黃河有奪淮奪運之勢、江北一帶的災區、到現在還是日見擴大、全國受災的地區、多到十六省、災民人數多到二千五百餘萬、有的全縣陸沉、有的全村淹沒、洪水中漂流的是整莊的房屋、樹梢上棲息的是成隊的難民、水裏撈獲的屍體、有全家老幼用繩子縛在一起不願離散的、我在一個朋友地方看見一個漢陽兵工廠職員的報告、說是廠裏的水雖然堵住、但是廠的四週、都在洪水裏面、日夜聽見號哭之聲、不是有人類神經系統的人所能受得住的、試看國家遇此大災、國家如何受得住、同胞遭此浩刦、我們能忍心在比較的豐衣飽食之下還不加以緩助嗎、</p>
<p>在這種慘痛可憐的情形之下、中央也盡其全力作拯救的工作、如中央黨部移撥所得捐都撥充賑欽、就是一例、但是因爲災區過大、財政困難、所以杯水車薪、仍然是無濟於事、不能不訴諸全國同胞的惻隱之心、如這次中央决定海關鐵路郵務人員的停止年年加薪、和年終獎金、中央公務人員一體捐薪半月的規定、都是萬不得已的辦法、就是只撥火食或是折扣發餉的士兵、在艱苦轉戰的時候、也都由蔣委員長令其每人至少捐餉二角、這都是出於民胞物與同一的動機、大家要知道有許、多公務員生活是很困難的，但是在非常嚴重的時勢之下、大家非有非常的决心不可、須知公務員的俸給、都是人民血汗擔負的、人民的生命尚且不存在、何有於公務員的職位、大家斷不能睡在火山噴出的液石液之上、以爲安全、大家雖然感覺得一時節衣縮食的痛苦、但是這種痛苦的結果、救活了的是多少從父母襁褓之中養大的生命、各位的仁漿義粟所救濟的、正是卽樹梢上棲息水面之浮沉無罪無辜的同胞、我看見大公報上登載天津洋車夫尚且出來提倡聯合捐助賑欵一百元、不覺得起了無限感佩的心思、試想這一百塊錢、要跑出多少洋車夫的血汗、跑短多少洋車夫的壽命、同時看見大公報登載某都市知識階級賭風之盛、不禁爲之太息、而祈禱這種的傳說不是眞實的、我們希望這種偉大的救災工作不僅一般公務員和知識界積極努力、尤其希望有錢的人有銀行存欵的人、格外的捐輸、</p>
<p>至於這次的賑欵、我們務必使他涓滴都落到災民身上、我們希望全部的賑務人員、都拿出良心來、爲災民謀實惠、同時中央亦歡迎社會的監督、對於事關民命的問題、大家都用不着客氣、急賑之外、應當積極注意工賬和農賑、工賑運用得適當、可以防止以後再遭水災、中國本來是農村社會、水退以後、農民自必返農、所以種籽的選擇借貸、耕具的補充、都是急待解决的問題、除了賑務人員應當積極爲人民打算外、還希望他們與農業敎育和技術機關以及金融機關密關切合作、尤其希望金融界把都市的資本盡量轉移到農村方面去、</p>
<p>講到防比水災的根本原則、就只五個字、「不與水爭地」築堤固然重要、假使沒有民國二十一年的堤工、今年長江的水災、更不堪設想、但是「不與水爭地」的原則尤屬基本、蔣委員長前幾年所倡廢田湖之議、再對也沒有了、可惜至今還未行、而洞庭都陽沿湖一帶、多爲地方豪紳藉開墾之名、霸佔爲田、至今尚未廢止、只有太湖沿岸、江蘇省政府曾實行廢止湖田的政績、現在水災如此、非政府有澈底的决心、實行蔣委員長的建議不可、我還有一點要補充的、就是廢田還湖、仍是不够、我們還得廢田還江、不坐飛機經過揚子江流域的、不知道提子江的危險、因爲坐輪船經過、只覺得兩旁是岸、而坐飛機下看、便覺得坐船所認爲岸的、大半都是沙洲、沙洲常多到十幾里路、以致長江一天一天的逼窄、沙洲的形成、一部份固由於長江冲積所致、但是大部份還是由於該死的沙田局、用竹簽和他種方法、容易攔阻長江冲下的泥沙、形成多量的沙田以便買賣升科、致陷長江於不可收拾的地步、所以這種沙田局的工作眞是罪該萬死、應該澈底的廢除、然後才談得上疏濬的問題、若是更能利用長江的水利、作灌漑的工作、那不但能够地盡其利、而且能够水盡其利了、談到黃河的問題、自然更爲復雜、非專門研究不能解决、現在黃河的河底、日見增長、如開封一帶的河底、甚至高過城牆三尺以上、這是何等的危險、我在四川灌縣、看見秦朝李冰「深淘灘低築堰」的遺訓回想黃河、不禁有無限的感慨、黃河的疏濬、因爲水流帶了大量的泥沙、不到海口而淤積的約有百分之四十、自然很不容易、但是如上游的造林種草、中流的固定河漕工作和水上試騐等項、也應當積極進行、從先漢朝的賈讓定治河三策、上策是「决黎陽遮害亭放河使入北海、」中策是「穿漕渠灌冀州田以殺水怒」下策是「繕定故堤培卑增薄、」實有還見、上中兩策姑不論、但是多年以來、都是實行他的下策、而不從根本看想、所以黃河的形勢、就每况愈下了、在這金風蕭颯秋高氣爽的時候、全國百萬以上的青年、或是升學、或是復學、這是很幸運的事、但是在這幸運當中、大家應該回想到或是故鄉的災情、父老流難失所的痛苦、或是多少同樣學力的青年、因爲這空前的水災、不能升學的痛苦、把在學校的情形和災區同樣靑年的情形來比較、眞是有天上人間之別、我們這些幸運的靑年、能不有深切的覺悟嗎、</p>
<p>我們希望於這有幸運求學的靑年們、第一是充分利用求學的期間、取得透闢的知識、不眞切不透澈的知識、是最危險不過的、看這兩年來中英庚欵留學考試淸華留學考試和教育部留學考試的成績、都覺得大學畢業生的程度、逐年進步了、雖然不行的也自有人在、但是看大學入學的試騐、中學畢業生的程度、還是不差、雖欲降格取錄、也有降無可降的情勢、其最大的毛病、在於對於任何科學都只有模模糊糊的印象、而不能作眞切的了解、希望自此以後積極改進、求其知道的多、而求其對於所知道的每件、能够眞正知道、在大學或中學裏面、尤其應當注重思想的訓練、務必使學生的思想澈底的科學化、千萬不可模糊籠統、混雜不淸、這不但關係於知識而且關係係一生的做人和處世、</p>
<p>第二希望求學的靑年、都能保持他們高尚的理想、有確定的人生觀、本來靑年的時代、就是理想時代、若是靑年沒有理想、目光只是集中在物質的享受、和現世的出路、那民族的將來也就危險極了、不幸近年以來、因爲社會經濟的壓迫、和低等唯物史觀的影響、青年高尙的理想、逐漸磨消、這是何等悲慘的事實、希望負敎育責任的人、和靑年自身積極的反省和覺悟、</p>
<p>第三希望靑年能造成不自私的人格、以表現高尚的理想、若是理想與事實分離、那理想就是幻想、理想的表演、不必在女處、就是極小的小處、也可以表演的、古人所謂一室尚不能掃、何能治國平天下、此言實有至理、若是自己口裏天天駡貪官汚吏、而自己時時想佔公家的便宜、或是把公家的東西不當數、或是沒法留名受公家的車船免票、這種心裏的出發點、與貧官汚吏有什麽分別、一切權利都是自己的、一切義務都是公家的、這是貪官汚吏的秘訣、希望有作爲的靑年、能够避免乾净、國家領袖的人才、全靠靑年在求學時代有這種人格的修養、</p>
<p>第四希望靑年對於世界大勢民族危機有不斷的注意、與深切的認識、以不完備的知識、對於國事妄作主張、固然不可、但是弄得志氣消沉、對於國事漫不經心、亦復不可、國家是有機體的、一個人的事業、對於大局息息相關、漠然視之、萬萬不可、士氣不可浮囂、但亦不可消沉、范仲淹作秀才的時候、卽以天下爲已任、以天下爲已任、自然未免口氣太大、但是對一於國事不覺得自己責任的嚴重、那國家也就　了、</p>
<p>第五希望靑年對於軍訓和體育的特別注意、在新興的民族裏面、靑年沒有不是經過刻苦耐勞有紀律有秩序的訓練的、健全的靑年、必須靠着健全的體魄、所以本年雙十節的時侯、有第六屆全國運動會的舉行、這决不僅是競技的比賽、乃是靑年心靈和體魄的訓練、說到軍訓更爲重要、紀律的生活是文明社會組織的基礎、何况中國在國難嚴重的時期、上次歐戰的時候、英國組織大批軍隊、其下級幹部、全靠大學生和中學生來補充、所以有士兵方面的訓練、只要三個月也就够了、德國戰敗以後、受凡爾賽條約的限制、不能有十萬以上正式軍隊的訓練、因此全國靑年藉各項體育組織的名義、實行軍事訓練、所以德國現在一旦宣告廢棄凡爾賽條約縛束的時侯、立刻能有五十萬以上軍隊的編制、我們現在的國勢、較戰後的德國、還要危險到百倍、但是我們還沒有這種條約的縛束、在我們現在還能自由集合訓練的時候、有志氣有血性的靑年、雖道不應當加倍努力嗎、我們應當想想將來、萬一連這點自由也沒有的時候、</p>
<p>最後我們還希望全國的敎職員、能够對於青年以身作則、在學問方面復爲青年樹一個知識的模范、在行爲方面復爲靑年樹一個人格的模範、國家到這個時候、知識階級的責任、應當比常人加重百倍、凡是墮落的行爲、頹唐的心理、都是純潔的知識界所不應當有的、我想也是不會有的、</p>
<p>還有一句話、是爲不能升學的青年或無力升學的靑年說的、我奉勸這班青年、不必喪氣、我們最重要的還是做一個良好的公民、升學不升學、倒是第二個問題、就是大學畢業或是留學回來、而道德不健全、人格不完備、不够做一個良好的公民、這稻人縱然多到無數、對於國家、也是有害無益的、良好的靑年、縱然不升學、對於國家還有許多方面可以服務、如今年政府毅然舉辦義務敎育、中央所籌的經費、連庚欵在內、雖然只有三百二十萬元、但是各省市自籌的經費、居然多到</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>一千零二十一萬八千餘元、各省所辦短期小學增加到四萬零八百四卡二校、附設班級增加到的數目楚五千零五一級、入學兒童的數目增加到四百零一萬四千八百三十三人、這種統計、還有些省份的數字、不包括在內、我們若是能在這方面努一點力、其效果比在都市裏面混一個小職員、對於國家對於民族有益得多了、因爲這是國家民民族復興的基礎、總之、在這內　外患交迫的時候、我們不能努力救災、便是自己摧毀自己的國力、而且於抵抗外侮的時候、增加國家無窮的隱憂、所以目前緊急的工作、莫過於救災、靑年是國家的基礎、若是靑年的敎育不完備、國家的基礎、便不穩固、民族的前途便無希望、所以目前基本的工作、便是靑年敎育、這點是我們大家當一致注意的事、（九日中央社電）</p>

<p>古人說：「天下至平者莫如水」但是水性下流，要在平的地方，它才肯平，可見「平」不是喻水的本性。又說一天下至公者莫如鏡」但是鏡之所照，使妍者愈妍，而媸者愈媸。同是人也，而有妍媸之別，本是造物不公之事；鉸，鏡祗知「因物附牧」，而不能絲毫有所調劑，矯造化之不公，補人問之缺憾，那裏算得至公？由此說來，天下簡直沒有「公」平的事情。</p>
<p>有淺的時候，你因周轉不靈，向人通融，那楚很大方的：喂！替我掉幾千幾百用一用絲毫不要躊躇，而對方也毫不留難地會答應你。到了沒有錢的時候，想向人借隻洋付房錢，也得千廻百　，還是吶吶不能出諸口。勉强說出來了，對方或許報答你一個冷笑，這不是人家的態度不同，是你自己的立塲先不同了。所以俗話說一要想望人家借鷄蛋，先得養肥了老母鷄。」這也是一種很透徹的人生哲學。</p>
<h3 id="c131">女敎員 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>我常想，設使全國的小學校，都用了女敎員，變做了母親學校，」兒童的成績，一定比目下來得可觀。不要以我醉心女敎員，把男敎員一概抹煞；因為調査經騐所得，事實足以證明我的主張。</p>
<p>兒童是最可愛的小天使，爛漫天眞，女性沉靜，男性活潑，要是施以好好的敎育，沒有不可以成器的。壞在當敎員的，自己還沒有成器，學識淺陋，行為惡劣，把好好的兒童，被他們敎壞。所以，現下的敎學，不在於談甚麽主義學說，出許多新花樣，而在於師資嚴格的檢定。那末我們做家長的，對於子女的敎育，自然放心了。</p>
<p>十幾年前的女敎員，多數是媽姻上發生過問題的女子。或的丈夫有了外遇，愛情有了裂痕；或的年靑寡鵠，迢迢歲月，把當小學敎員來消磨時光；伊們的遭遇是很可憐的。從前我在Ｎ市××女學常敎員的時候，同事裏面有位Ｂ女士，性情恬靜，敎導有方，小學生都是小鳥般的親暱伊。伊有一個女兒，一個兒子，帶在身邊讀書，聰明淸秀，十分可愛。第二年的暑假前幾天，全校小學生忽然得着校長先生辭歇伊的消息，發起一個歡送會，以為留別紀念。我坐在旁聽席上，見Ｂ女士登了講臺，先說了幾句謙虛勗勉的話，末了道：諸位小弟弟小妹妹，今天開歡送會來送我，是非常威謝的，我希望將來諸位送我一種東西也許不會拒絕吧？我當時很奇怪伊自己討學生贈品，不料伊接着說道：諸位小弟弟小妹妹也許肯送我幾副輓聯吧！說着，眼圈兒紅了。這時，在座許多小學生，有晞噓起來的，我也一陣心酸，跑到外面去了。</p>
<p>原來Ｂ女士的丈夫，雖是讀書人，却性情惡劣，甘心下流，已到了墮落的田地，終年在外飄蕩，也不知道流落在甚麽地方。B女士由　君的介紹，到Ｎ市××女學來執敎鞭，條件是月薪二十元以外，免掉伊的子女二人學膳費。後來因為學校經費支絀，只得把伊　約，改聘了一位Ｃ女士，却省了兩個兒童的口糧。但，B女士的生活，因此，便發生問題了！</p>
<h3 id="c132">高櫃台 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>典當和普通商店，最顯著的區別，是那個櫃台，此了普通商店的櫃台，至少是高一倍。　奉躱得高高地，托起了水烟袋兒，放着一副不折不扣的正派朝奉臉，向櫃外一覽無餘的俯瞰一切，更顯得站在高櫃台外面，愁眉苦臉的當當者的矮了三尺。</p>
<p>說起那當裏的高櫃台，那是再也威風不過的。我記得我小的時候，奉着嚴命去上當，櫃台高，個子低，踮起了十個足趾，屏着氣，才算把那衣包送上了櫃。朝奉似理不理的把衣包解開來瞧了一眼，冷冷　說道：「當五塊錢」。但是我奉嚴命，須當八塊錢。朝奉鐵靑着臉說：「至多當六塊」。說着，把衣包向櫃口一推。但我踮長了足趾，實在够不到。於是那朝奉隨手把衣包字一推，掉在地卜，把衣服摔了一地。在那一次裏，我是對於這個高櫃台，留下了一個一世都不會磨滅的印象。</p>
<p>但是這個氣燄萬丈的高櫃台，據說，如今也走上了不幸的命運之途了。每一個高櫃台上，只是吐出白花花的大洋錢，吞進些滿當了換不起錢的貨品。於是典當老闆，一籌莫展。朝奉先生，也不似先前那麽的整天托着水烟袋，攸閒自得了。高櫃台在形式上，雖然還是高高地蹲踞着，可是高櫃台的威勢，已是今非昔比了。</p>
<p>今年，上海因不景氣的壓迫，典當已收歇了不少。內地，因農村崩潰，典當也在陸續的閉歇，所存着的幾家，也不過是在苟延殘喘而巳。高櫃台的黃金時代，已消逝了，現在已到了日暮途窮之境了。恐怕的在不久的將來，所謂「高櫃台」也者，將成為一個歷史上的名詞了吧。</p>

<p>馬三往外走時，房門外已有兩個聽差攔住，左邊一巴掌，右邊一拳頭，打得他倒跌進屋裏來。那兩個聽差緊跟在後面，也到了屋子裏來。扳着面孔，挺了腰幹子，站在馬三的後面。馬三以為暗暗的給藍太太一個釘子，轉身就走，就算完了。不想房門沒出，就被人家打了回來。回頭看到那兩個聽差，兇惡十分，貼身站了，只好垂手站定。藍專員也坐着挺起了腰子道：這東西十分可惡。我們這裏和你說話，你為什麽理也不理，扭身就走。馬三只好低了聲音道：我以為沒有什麽話了，所以走的。因為我只管樓底下的事。藍專員道：我正只要你管樓底下的事。你聽聽，那個哭的女人，還在咿咿唔唔的哭。你去對他說，這小西天不是他一個人租下的，叫他顧全公德，不能再哭。他若要再哭，我就要叫警察來了。馬三連連答應了兩聲是，站着沒有個敢動。藍太太道：你下樓去吿訴他罷，若再要哭，我連你一齊辦。滾！馬三慢慢的退出了房門，一溜烟的下了樓梯，聽到月英在屋子裏更是哭得吃緊。正待張口向裏面說話。却看到房門開了，只得頓了一頓。同時，聽到賈多才歎氣道：你這人怎麽勸不信。我若不是念起你初到我身邊，來使出了我的脾氣，你就受不了。又聽到月英帶了哭聲道：你想呀！骨肉述心，我聽到說我娘病了，你又不許我回去看一眼，有個心裏不難過嗎？（三一一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>那太監便巔巍巍的將一茶　的珠粉授給太后，太后一接過來，便伸出舌頭把那粉倒了上去；其時我們站在旁邊承値的人已早就給伊端整下一盅溫茶，只待伊把珠粉傾入口內，便忙着送茶過去，伊也不接茶杯，就在我們手內喝了幾口，急急的把珠粉吞下去了。</p>
<p>「珠粉這一樣東西的分量是很重的！」有一次，伊曾經吿訴過我關於服食珠粉的功用。「如其稍稍服食幾許，那是很能帮助我們留駐我們的靑春的，它的功效純粹在皮膚上透露，可以使人的皮膚永遠十分柔滑有光，年老的人可以和年輕的人一般無二：只是服食的分量千萬要少一些，而且每兩次之間，一定要隔着相當的日子，如其關食的分太多了，或是沒有規定的時間，隨便隔幾天就服食一次，那末非但對於人體無益，簡直還有大大的有害咧！</p>
<p>伊老人家雖是這樣說了，但珠粉是否眞有駐顏的功用，在我們不曾把它化騐過以前，我也不敢如何肯定；便是太后的容貌能够維持得比尋常的老年人都輕嫩一些，是否確是常服珠粉的結果，我也不能切實代為證明。祇知道一直到我出宮為止，太后服食珠粉的習慣是始終沒有間斷過，伊而且對於這件事似乎總是看得很鄭重的樣子。（四一一）</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>「怕妻二分當。」這句話是頗可相信的。</p>
<p>某醫生自海外歸來而後，聲譽日著，生涯不覺蒸蒸日上了。日間門庭如市，午後應付出診，眞有些忙不過來。他家本不甚富裕，可是經他懸牌應診以來，不到數年，一所洋房已巍巍地建築在城中心了。這全是他夫人之力。</p>
<p>伊是一位舊式女子，他和伊本來是不大合式的；但是一家的經濟權，則完全操在伊的手中。他有多少家私，連他自己也不大淸楚，就是各銀行的存摺上也沒有過他的名字。</p>
<p>伊是非常精細的，並且好行小惠；所以他一天門診有多少，出診有多少，打針費有多少，一分一釐都瞞不過伊來。有時伊高興了，給他一二塊錢作零用，並且還須實報實銷，經核准後，方再可以給欵。</p>
<p>伊治家自然是很節儉，雖然歡喜打打馬將，並且好得這是一種消遣，贏贏輸輸也不在乎此。在夏天，有時伊打馬將打得高興起來，那替子女洗浴等事，便都委他代理。有時伊嫌子女麻煩，則在馬將檯上拿出角洋若干，命他領了子女看影戲去。這些事雖然他於浴罷歸來，形神俱疲之際不大願意做，然而也只得唯唯從命。</p>
<p>伊常對人說：「三個兒子將來各造一所洋房給他。」某醫生聽了，一時固覺得不大有些甘做老牛，然一念及「怕妻三分富，」一口氣也平下來了。</p>

<p>— 枕孫</p>
<p>余戚某，藉父祖蔭，家小康；畢大學業，小有才也。少之時，當其就學之年，輒已沾花惹草，所謂愛博而情不專者；人諒其弗懍於血氣未定之戒耳。旣娶，口不嫌於昏式之陳，而於新婦頗敦燕好，產子女焉。然有外戀漸通於家，無何而譜惑其親，遽誣其婦，並子女而棄之。新人入於室，亦有雛；則並時又別有驩，旋復離而日就所驩矣。今某年屆知命，計其更易之外婦殆不勝數，所與生殖，而遺於世者實繁有徒；日者，日聞其甫暱有新寵焉。烏乎，盛已！</p>
<p>某之擯棄其室人與所驊也，雖彼元妃繾綣繫情，欲化望夫之石，其他或徘徊歧路，尋為墮溷之花，彼自甘為薄倖王魁，曾小一動其憐惜酸慚之念，有為之長相守者，彼視之譬猶嫠婦之自守其亡夫。余特偶與一席留情於茅店鷄聲之裏，忽忽就道於曉風殘月之間，致無虞其蛾眉之有望也。或別圖終其身者，彼視之寖假羅敷之自有其本夫，余特偶與陳倉暗度，占得風流，固母責其十年之不字也。</p>
<p>其並合所生於乃母而去也，實其衣食敎養於不顧不問。或僅可支持於母不失離，或心力俱細而母子離散，是一任其萍飄蓬轉，掙扎於運命之流，終至為雄為傑，為賊為囚，或為餓莩為槁骸，猶諸秦人視越人之肥瘠，長可漠然無動於中焉！昔人有言：『幼吾幼，以及人之幼。』彼所奉行，又何不可曲解以為「是『幼」也，吾幼遺以及人之「幼」字也』乎？於是人知其服膺於出門不認貨之旨耳。</p>
<p>某固智識人也。其逐逐於色界之天以遺其生，乃嬰痼疾喪貲廢業，至頗不理於人口，彼亦振振有說，以自託於哲義達觀焉：「於戲！世之人胼胝一生，搖精傷神而不憚煩，固何圖哉？彼豈不惟樂爾妻拏，大吾門楣之是欲哉？執能拾得於此，神仙所不難幾，聖賢所莫能及，富貴於我似浮雲，不亦栩栩然自得至樂哉？且夫人之有生，貴能適意耳！吾生有涯，若不乘時忘我無我，利用之以自適其意，而局局焉，切切焉，惟愛嗔白慾之用事，孤負此短暫之生，亦虛生耳！汝安則為之！於戲！此衆生苦惱之所繇。可憐孰甚夫！」</p>
<p>聽其言，甚口似有斷，然人人即其老父咸謂之安人也，其室人之守志者，並守其子女，而終受其殃，是又彼之妄人也乎？異哉，彼所謂達者，殆能獨善其身者與？將以浪漫終其身而無悔與？吾志之，吾覘之！</p>

<p>六　全運會四川選手隊、自經川省預選產生後、即於八月十八日起、全體集中外南華西大學、作合宿之訓練、男選手住華美宿舍、女選手寓育德宿舍、相隔甚近，每日經各敎練之熱心指導及選手之發奮練習、　績均有進步，管理一律軍事化、華大運動塲雖不十分合用、但校合　大、空氣新鮮、風　優美、確為用中之冠、適宜於選手之住宿每晨五時至六時半及午後三時半至五時半，爲田徑及各種球類訓練時間，茲特將各指導各受訓選手及逐日生活表、分別列後、</p>

<p>想在此短時間中、訓練做人、做復與民族戰士的基礎、目標雖如此、但各選手習慣大性太深、未見即能收美滿結果、至於個人此次返川、明知責任甚大、困難甚多、障碍生、仍努力前進者、實責任問　耳、並素拘不顧犧牲不顧成敗之决心、祇知埋頭苦幹、成十體育同志多至四十餘人雖　派系、實無所謂派系、蓋各同志煥散到不能成為派系、眞無三個人以上之團體、意志極不相投、如此情形、本難合作、此次個人返川、即全籌　全　預選、所有同志均任大會職員、在個人幾次淡話後、　能了解國家民族所　之地位、與去體育可　之地位、本身附負之責任、在大會中所表現合作之精神、頗為社會人士所稱道、此不能不晚是四川體育之好轉機也、最後劉主任謂、四川選手隊因程途太遠、大致九月二十日前即可總啟程東下云云、</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>「我出去走一趙：你要來嗎？」乃德問道，他想做出若無其事的神氣，却又很感激她因為　的無言的同情，他原想人人要賤視他是個壞貨了。</p>
<p>「唯唯！」小梅就跑去拿了她的帽子，自覺今天被一個年長的童子約為伴佔，頗自欣幸。</p>
<p>別的人也見他們兩人過去，但沒有人去跟隨他門，由比可見童子門並並呆笨可粗俗，也們又似出於天性一般覺得遇到忠難的時候，　和仁愛的小梅實是他們最合商的朋友。</p>
<p>「這一次的散步是有益於乃德的，他回來的時候比平常更更安靜，幷且看去又復愉快，滿身掛上　菊的花圈，這是他的小游伴，當他躺在草地上對她講述故事的時候，為他搓成的。</p>
<p>更沒有人談到那天早晨的不幸事件，可是它的影響也許因此而史為悠久。乃德竭盡心力以向上，也得到了許多帶助，不祇在他向着天公熱誠的祈禱，而亦在於塵寰裏那個益友耐心的將護，他的和善的手，乃德碰到時，從沒有不記得這是曾經為他之故而願意忍受着痛苦過的。</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>這裏是我的七十幾篇雜文。</p>
<p>我開始想寫文章，是一九三三年的春天，那時候我新遭父喪，掙扎在生活的重担下，悲憤，疲倦，寂寞，常常想找一個排遺的方法；又因為孤身寄寓，可與閑談的人少，所以就翻翻申報，也看看裏面的自由談。</p>
<p>這樣就有了投稿的念頭。</p>
<p>不過並沒有就寫。直到五月底邊，因為父親所遺給我的債務，有一部份催逼得很緊；家裏更是不斷的來信告訴我自從父親死後，親戚的冷淡，父執的疎遠，村人的作威作福，接着是母親的右眼瞎了，一萬枝箭一齊射向我這顆年靑的心。我實在無法擺脫，盤在寓所裏，聽著兼旬的雨聲，心緒非常落寞，也非常悲憤。</p>
<p>但仍舊只能看看自由談。</p>
<p>雨還是落下去，我也一天一天的愈加悲憤了。這時候唯一的自慰的方法，似乎就只有想想往事，隨後也寫在紙上，試寄到自由談去，過了幾天，居然登出來了，這是第一篇，也便是收在這個集子裏的「故鄉的雨」。</p>
<p>於是，我就變做自由談的投稿者了。</p>
<p>但我並沒有把自己的悲憤帶到紙上去。起先所寫的，大概是屬於回憶的閑談和記事，有時候也連帶到文壇或時事，說話的態度率直。一點不知道忌諱，實在是很孩子氣的。</p>
<p>此後我也向別的刋物投些稿子，這裏所有的，大都在自由談，火炬，太白，新語林，人間世，讀書生活，動向，語林等處發表過。不過也並不是全部，有許多因為散佚，有的則是由於故意的刪去。</p>
<p>我寫文章很慢，往往改了又改，倘使說得好聽一點，那該是很小心的。但有時却反而小心出毛病來，還因此惹起過一點誤會，然而誤會罷了，對於我自已，是不發生什麽影響的。</p>
<p>正和我的出身一樣，我到如今還是一個粗坏，而且是一個帶有幾分年靑人的血氣的粗坏。</p>
<p>這幾年來，我們常看見中年以及中年以上的人們，在玩着奇奇怪怪的把戲，幽默早已成名，笑話也巳經出過選集；玩骨董，喝好茶，題打油詩；讀莊子，薦文選，寫篆字聯；下焉者還要提倡讀經，復興文言，這叫做活得不耐煩。但遭殃的可又是靑年。因為自己活得不耐煩了‘於是也來勸靑年們學老成，裝閑適，述十歲上下的孩子們也不能倖免，小學讀經了多少純潔有用的腦子，被糟塌成了化石。</p>
<p>在這些塲合上，我願意放開喉嚨，盡我的力量來反對。這倒也並不是因為我自己還是靑年，問題特別切身的緣故，實在是這兩年來，留給靑年們走的路，可眞太艱難了。大大小小的責任，一開口，總是放到靑年們的肩上的！然而眞的肩了起來呢，這個說「不對」，那個說「不是」，甚而至於還有「不許」。愛新鮮是需要說誑，一失業又是眼界高，才力弱。請想想吧，我的先生們，那裏是路呢？</p>
<p>然而路是有的，那必須靑年們自己打出來。</p>
<p>我的文章，有時候也出現於紳士的座上——提倡閑適的刋物裏，不過我是只賣稿，不賣身的，所以有許多意見，也仍舊是粗坏的意見。但天下的自我，偏偏只有一家，紳士們有自我，而粗坏是不准有自我的，那命運是被刪削。</p>
<p>這使我不敢再走到紳士座上去。</p>
<p>我收在這本書裏的雜感，是到本年三月底為止的。</p>
<p>看看又是黃梅時節了，我的心緒還是不改兩年前的悲憤，疲倦，寂寞，但這回可並不怎樣蜷縮。</p>
<p>把這本書叫做推背集，是沒有什發深意的，也並不是說我的文章將預言着什麼。相傳李淳風和袁天綱作推背圖的時候，做到第六十圖，袁推李背止之，這是推背圖名的由來。我現在只寫一點雜文，並未管到後世，然而却也時時覺得有人在推着我的背脊止住我。好了，現在把這七十幾篇東西編訂成集，終算　了一個小小的結束。倘使一定要說推背集有什麽意思，那末，這就算是我的意思吧！</p>
<p>（附言）推背集將由天馬書店出版，現在印刷中，半月內即可與讀者見面。</p>
<h3 id="c180">變「橘」（中） <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>在湖南，靠近洞庭湖的一帶地方，從來是產橘的名地。然有人說韋應物的詩句一洞庭須待滿林霜，」那是說的太湖洞庭山，因為他曾做過蘇州刺史，所以詩裏說及。同時我們還可以舉出一些關于洞庭山產橘的證據，例如王維送人赴越州的詩句「風樵若耶路，霜橋洞庭秋。」又蘇子美的姑蘇詩也有「洞庭柑熟客分金」的一句。據古地理書說，楚之洞庭湖是有地道通吳之洞庭山的，所以呌做洞庭，附會了一些神話，當然不可靠。不過兩地同樣產橘，却有古人的訊載可老。山海經裏說的「洞庭之山，其木多橘，」我也記不淸在楚在吳。又據襄陽記說：「李叔平臨終勅其子曰，龍陽洲裏有千頭木奴，及柑橘成，歲得絹千疋。」龍陽即今湖南漢壽。晋張華　說：「橘在湖水側，菲陋人莫傳。」劉瑾橘賦說：「寄生于南楚。」謝惠連柑賦說：一傾予節兮湖之區。一又宋崇寗三年，大遼使謝賜柑表說：一大香滿袖，染湘水之淸霜。雲液盈盤，挹洞庭之餘潤。」可見湖南從來就是產橘的，洞庭橘是很名貴的一種果實了。</p>
<p>倘若禹　裏說的「淮海惟揚州，厥句橘柚錫責，」揚州果然包括如今江蘇安徽江西浙江福建塊地方，那麽，我們可以考見中國古代橘的產地之廣。又左思蜀都賦裏有「戶有橘柚之園，」可證四川在古代也是產橘的。異物志說：一交趾有橋官，秩二百石，主歲貢御橘。」又述異記說：「越多橘抽，歲有橋稅。」自漢以來所說交趾，南越，就是如今的兩廣地方，還包有安南的一部分。此地在漢時就當然是產橘最多的地方了。原來橘性喜溫畏寒，是最宜於南方生長的植物，生在珠江流域的最好，生在長江以南的次之，生在江北就要變種了。記得晏子春秋裏說過「橋生淮南則為橘，生于淮北則為枳，葉徒相似，其實味不同，所以然者何？水土異也。」博物志也說「橘渡江化為枳。」本草有枳殼，說是「江左所謂吳臭橘。」又潘安仁為賈謐作贈陸機詩說：「在南稱柑，渡北稱橙。」柑也是不能北渡的。</p>
<p>橘和柑本是兩種不同的果物，古人却每每分不淸楚。上文所引古人說橘的話，有連帶說到柑的。東坡集中有劉景文藏王子敬帖詩，說是「君家兩行十二字，氣厭鄴侯　萬　。」東坡居十曾說「世傳王子敬帖，有黃柑三百顆之語，此帖在劉季孫景文家，景文死，不知今入誰家矣。」本是王右軍義之帖，東坡誤為王大令獻之帖；本是奉橘三百顆，東坡誤為黃柑三百顆；不過柑橘分不淸，並不是只有東坡錯了。在湖南，不僅形如手指的佛手柑，粗於碗大的柚子，僅供賞玩的　據，大家分辨得淸淸楚楚。橋和柑是有分別的，和橙也是有分別的。柑皮黃而不紅，有臭氣，或稱奧皮柑，味酸不　。橙子較橋大，較柚小，皮靑不紅像香　，却是不香，也不能吃。然而新會橙，溫州柑，都是好吃的，當然也可以說是「水土異也！」</p>
<p>溫州柑略帶苦味，苦中有甜，味道不壞。宋韓彥直做官溫州的時候，著了一部橘錄，上港說柑說橙，中卷說橘，下卷說種植的方法。柑是溫州的名產，可以說是有書為設了。有人說，新會橙就每柑，因為廣東人呌柑做甜橙，呌蜜橘做柑，所以有高身橙，扁身柑的分別。我以為廣東蜜橘好過暹羅密橘，福建蜜橘却和湖南橘子的味道差不多。南豐蜜橘雖小，味道却不壞。最小的是吉安金橘，　鴿蛋還小，味道在皮。歐陽修的歸田錄裏說：「金橘產於江西，以遠　致，都人初不識。明道景　初，始與竹子俱至京師，竹子味酸，人不甚喜二後遂不　　　　　　　味美，置之樽俎間，光彩灼爍，如今彈丸，誠珍　也。都人初亦不甚貴，其後因溫成　　　好食之，由是價東京師。余世安江西，見吉州人甚情此果。其欲久留者，則於菉豆中藏之，可經時不變，云橋性熱而豆性凉，故能久也。」江西金橘到北宋績　視為進御珍果。如今雖是拜金古義盛行的時代，金字放在第一，金橘却不甚責　，一個銅板兩顆，上海小兒也丕歡喜吃牠。只讓出自金元國家的金山蜜橘稱雄一時。你看上海水菓　上，一年四季不是都有花　蜜橋出售麽？</p>

<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>電燈突然熄滅了，小小的神廳被窒斷了呼吸，從內部膨脹起來。神　上的油燈也好像死了一次，然後慢慢地複活起來的。有人點上一枝牛油的　燭，四處飄着噯味的浮沉不定的光輝，——幾世紀以前的古老生活，就在我們身邊開始了。</p>
<p>一個靜靜的，不被人發見的角落，那裏散發着幽微的潮氣，小蟑螂偷偷地爬行着，在我底坐位底前前後後。工人阿漢，年輕的學生范增光，他底女同學陳綺，差不多以相等的距離平排地坐在我右手邊。他們好像沒有動過一動。</p>
<p>憎恨是我們所有的人底共通的特點。在十年裏面我不曾碰到過一個純粹快樂的人物——中國沒有這樣的人，我們在憎恨裏面呼吸，在牠裏面吃食，睡覺，牠佔有着和氧氣一樣的重要的位置。因為范增光立意要做一個有趣的提議，牠就被這些年輕人選做談論的題目了。</p>
<p>「好，你先說吧。」</p>
<p>阿漢一點沒有躊躇地說出來</p>
<p>「是的，自然是這個樣子的。我頂恨本來沒有膽量，在月不着膽量的地方，裝成英雄不過的樣子那種人……問問他們吧，全跟我一樣恨死這班契弟！講起打架，第一個嚷着「來多些，手密些』的是他，第一個向別人挑戰，說『有寳麼？撞你心口』的是他，後來……第一個肚子疼的正是他！」</p>
<p>大家都笑起來了。輪到陳綺，她就用一種尖銳的，帶着燒一般的刺激性的嗓子告訴我</p>
<p>「我底世界是小的。我們不打架。因此我頂恨一種人，他當面答應你一件事情，過後却不動手做，他過後决計不做的事情，當面却永遠不拒絕你。到處都有這稱虛偽的脚色…我到死都不能够原諒他。」</p>
<p>「我也憎恨一種虛偽的脚色，也是到死都不能够原諒的。可是那個人和你們所說的差得多遠呵！」</p>
<p>范增光激動地呌起來，但隨即沉默下去了，輪流把大家望了一遍，才緩緩地說：</p>
<p>「這是一個關於戀愛的小故事。有一個姑娘和我很相好，我們彼此都很快樂。在快樂裏面我們還在各方面計劃過我們底將來。……但是，像一切的戀愛似地，她丟下我到一倘更榮耀的目標那里去了。那時，我們都喜歡把姑娘呌做「風景」……兩年以後，這個風景又回到我這裏來　可是她底過去我是完全知道的，她有了一個足以驕傲的愛人，她底愛人是一個金融家，最近才做過一筆投機生意發了大財。</p>
<p>「我是愚壽的，所以我仍然同樣地愛她。一切都對她　忠。她是個漂亮而迷人的姑娘，所以她自然是狡滑的了。她需嬰我底愛情，但不需要我底忠心，—彷彿那是不値踐的爛布。我問她什麽東西，她都推說不曉得。宣言說自己不曾有過愛人。「某金融家最近不是發了一筆大財麽？」「我一輩子沒有過一個做投機事業的朋友。」這風景是把我看做傻子的！假使有一天我要被押釗刑塲去砍頭，在血底紅光裏我仍然還要咀咒她！……」</p>
<p>在說話的時候，他底長長的身子越挺越直，似乎要依着無限的延長伸展上去，變成瘦得可怕，現在，一根橡皮似地彈動着突然縮小了，而且向地面彎下去。</p>
<p>大家在他底叙述裏面沉思了好一會兒。</p>
<p>「現在，維叔來吿訴我們吧。」</p>
<p>誰提議了，但是我沒有做聲。憎恨不是每個人都一致的，在相反的心情裏——或者利害點上，有相反的響應。儘舉出人類可憎惡的地方是沒有意思的，人並不為了侮辱別人而生存。……其實，這三種憤恨我都是同感的。</p>

<p>那曉得才跨出大門檻，一頭就碰見小二子。氣急喘喘地對着媽媽嚷：「快去！快去！他的擔子挨人擠倒了，跟人打架，要上警察局了！」</p>
<p>媽媽的手不住的發抖，丟下兩個孩子對小二子說：「小二哥，請把他們帶回去！」說着就跑。隨手又扔下了鍮匙。</p>
<p>小毛頭要哭，給小二子哄住了。小和尙有點害怕，盾見對面照壁下有一堆人在扭打着，碗盞在地下打碎。媽媽正奔那兒去。</p>
<p>小二子牽着兩個孩子走回家。打那白粉牆下面走過，他倆還想看看熱鬧，伸頭一望，高架上沒有了人，那長板也一頭落地一頭蹺在半空裏。推推欄柵，鎖住了。小二子催着回家，小和尙又給那塊長板和它下面那架子瞧了一眼。</p>
<p>小二子回去賣　　，關照他倆別出門，媽媽帮助爸爸去打人，一刻兒就回來了。</p>
<p>兩個孩子不曉得怎麽好，等了半天，媽媽還沒回。小毛頭挖着爛泥搓圓球，想做一個像人家踢的球兒。可是搓夾搓去總太小。小和尙　搬了一條板凳抵在墻上，想爬上去望下滑。板凳站不住，爬也爬不上。砰的一聲板凳倒了，小毛頭的球兒也壓扁了。</p>
<p>小毛頭哭起來。小和尙使大人似的哄妹妹。妹妹不理他，他也急了。想出玩藝兒逗她笑。一下子看見爸爸睡的床，床上褥子揭起了，露出幾條長木板。便拉了妹妹向床跑：「玩那個板！」</p>
<p>小毛頭翻翻眼，她也想到「那個板」了，怎麽玩呢？</p>

<h3 id="c185">寡婦組織俱樂部 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 高源</p>
<p>福州通訊：「福建雲霄縣有丁秀珍女士者，系出名門，早年適人，不幸紅顏未老，卽喪所天，靑燈孤衾，自多傷感，女士未未居處無郎，空帷難守，乃玫嫁華僑某君，遠赴菲島，而該地禮敎素嚴，對女士置之不齒，冷嘲熱諷，予以難堪。現其夫又逝，女士不得已乃返鄉。詎邑人皆恥與往還。女士至此，自覺益復無聊，惟以後夫遺產甚夥，乃捐資五十萬元，糾集寡婦中之志同道合者　組織一寡婦俱樂部，使當地相憐成病者得一聚樂機會。現正建築，九月內卽　成立，內有戲塲，舞塲，圖書館，彈子房，高而夫球塲等，使一般寡婦得以　情遣性，不生他種妄念。」</p>
<p>這裏顯明的吿訴我們：如果能够有優越的財富，就讓被諷刺也有方法來應　，雖然不一定要來組織寡歸俱樂部。</p>
<p>現在，這俱樂部就將要成立了。他的設備，以通訊裏所說，大半是屬於娛樂方面的。娛樂是生活上的一種需要，但並不就是生活，所以想用娛樂來免除生理上的需要並不够。或謂丁女士的設施是錯誤的也未嘗不可。我們要知道，一個人的生活如果安定，精神上的痛苦就减少很多。在社會經濟極度恐慌中，這種安定是不可能，尤其是婦女，在復古的聲浪下，她們有的被逼着跑回家庭，有的被齒笑改嫁。這個俱樂部的成立是給這些不能改嫁的寡婦們以娛樂，以安慰的。</p>
<p>但是，我們少微想一下就知道所謂能參加娛樂的寡婦者不是沒錢的，而是有錢者。根本丁女士是屬於有錢方面的，他自然不會往另外一羣人身上着眼。而且事實上這個俱樂部如果把某一些寡婦劃入志同道合（守節）者，也只是給復古運動以有力的帮助，使封建勢力把頭抬得更高些，也就是把反封建歸女壓迫的更重些。</p>
<p>也許有人說，在俱樂部組織者的本身上不　得是如此想的，照上面的論斷未免寃枉她。可是我們以爲客觀上她們是無意或有意地用婢樂來麻醉人們。</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>那時候我還是一個孩子，我記得，淸楚地記得，在那遙遠的南方，有着許多榕樹的南方，我很愛做夢；又記得在那許多麥之中有一個不是夢，而是眞實。——</p>
<p>獨自個兒地走到了原野，那是剛給一次狂風暴雨所洗刦過的晴朗而凄凉的原野，這裏是我慣常的地方，我對它非常地熟悉，因爲常常在一些沒有伴侶的時候，我便獨自個兒地投入它的懷抱，讓它來安慰我的寂寞，讓它來長成我的幼弱的心靈。這一次也沒有例外，我在周遭地轉了一次以后，又自然而然地走到這棵曾經伴了我從懂事的日子起到那時候的老榕樹下了。</p>
<p>老榕樹也是很凄凉的，據伯伯們說：它獨自個兒地活了這上百的年紀，沒有別的什麽槐呀柏呀來倍伴它，因爲在</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>這原野里本來便是荒瘦的泥土，種別的菜樹或蔭樹之類是得不到長大的，所以它便孤寂地過着這上百年紀的獨自個兒的生活。也許我們是同感吧，我却老是留戀着它，只要偶然來了一個機會，我是會伴着它來過我那孤寂的生活的。從幼年時候，陰鬱便蓋上了我的眼睛。而也許這孤寂的老榕樹過着比我更可怕的生活吧，——我常常聽見它的哭聲。</p>
<p>它的哭聲很低微，只有倚着它一直流下去的小溪聽得到；而我的小樓却是建着在溪旁，有時在深夜裏，小溪常常帶着了它的哭聲吹進了我的耳朶，當我聽到了時，我的心是難過的，我雖然是獨自個兒地過活，可是到了夜裏也可以找一處安定的地方來睡眠，可是年老而又孤獨的它便只剩得了哭泣來延長着它的壽命了。這樣的的時候，我常常想到立刻地去找它來看看，可是在窗門上雖然窮了我的眼睛也是望不到它的，因為頭皮的小溪是剛在這裏轉了一個灣。這樣的一個晚上，我便失眠了，眼睛對着了那巨大的兩點打着在窗門，象打到了我心頭一樣地難過。</p>
<p>第二天，淸晨我便趕了起來，連臉也沒有揩的，便匆忙地走到原野的懷抱，走近了可憐的孤獨的這老榕樹。我看着那酒了滿地的落葉，我差不多忍不得地哭起來。我檢起了一爿焦黃的落葉，捧着了在懷裏正想帶着回去的時候，忽地沉重的一下，一塊落葉又飄到在我的頭上來。我還沒有捉得着它的時候，它又飄到了小溪中去了。</p>
<p>—哎喲，嫩綠的葉也落了嗎？</p>
<p>我驚駭地注視着那一張是嫩綠的榕樹葉，我心裏更難過起來了。我心裏在猜度着，用了我那時候的一切理解力，也都想不通。焦黃的老了的葉子，才會給那暴風雨所掛殘的吧，怎麽這樣的一片還沒有長成的葉子也給淘汰了下來哩？於是我設想了許多的理由，但是我還是不十分明白：於是我更埋怨起暴風雨了。可怕的暴風雨，連這還沒有長成的葉子也殘忍地吹了下來，讓它那給早熟了的身體在過着那些被侮辱與被損害的飄流的生活了。</p>
<p>小溪的急流也沒有留情，它把這嫩綠的落葉捲着在懷抱裏一直往下流里送去。那時侯，我帶着殉道者一樣的悲哀的心情，沿着了溪邊，一直送着那經不起風雨的落葉。我看着它那微小的身軀在急流里倔强地掙扎的雄姿，我逐漸地被感動了。小溪拐了一個灣，我迅速地爬上了我的小樓，目視着我這小伴侶一忽一忽地遠了我。我舉着手，向它默禱着，我那時候不詛咒暴風雨了，我祝禱着它的努力的掙扎。</p>
<p>當它的影子也消失了時，我才感覺到我的沿臉孔是在風雨中，我　上了窗，頹然地倒在床上了。</p>
<h3 id="c187">鹿角鎭 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>就這樣的，我們歇來來，時候雖不算早，但也並不晚，鐘的針淸楚的指在六點上。</p>
<p>對於所停歇的地方，在印象上，雖能給我們留下了一些淡漠的影子，但，對於裏面的內實，那是很模糊的，這鎭裏住有多少人家，出產點什麽，當農村的崩潰下，牠所佔有的位置究竟在什麽地步，關於這些，我們是沒有方法知道的，時間，决定了我們的行程，那些，是需要相當的時日吶！</p>
<p>落棧以後，第一步想要知道的當然就是這鄉鎭的名字，於是，伕頭在我們的眼中差不多已成了唯一的對手，結果呢？對手在全部的騷亂的空氣裏消失到鎭的那一端去，一個熟悉路徑的伕子吿訴我們，這是鹿角鎭。</p>
<p>假使要說在記憶裏埋下一點深的印痕的話，那，鹿角鎭是値得一提的。</p>
<p>無論在形式以至面積上牠都是較高一籌的，進口的地方是一個總匯，出去的時候，却留下了兩個支岔，在這條V形的鎭道裏，除了客棧以外，小經營也很不少。也許要算是特點吧？鎭子裏，看不見天，由兩側的屋頂當中，被一塊什麼東西緊緊地壓着，不透風，也看不見日頭，一切，都被幽暗包繞着，在人們的臉上，呈露了可怕的鐵靑。</p>
<p>轎子，什物，監督着架上了客棧裏特築物的頂架（註），這樣，我們偕同着走進了第二　的裏廂。</p>
<p>第二進的前面，留一個大的院落，院頂和鎭裏一樣，不透空氣，僥倖的是還有幾塊玻璃，可以望得見天的色彩，雲的漂流，同時，也可以望得見在這個客棧裏每一個角落的形態。</p>
<p>脱下了被汗水泡透的衣衫，「大洗一番」已成了必要的工作，把自己帶來的面盆和店家所有的面盆，都裝滿了凉水，用搶掠的手段佔據着，洗擦着，一面還在咕嚕着今天的天是怎樣的熱呵之類的話頭。</p>
<p>在不經意的一瞥中，看見店裏的小伙計領了茶壺走上了角落裏的樓梯，神情是怪不願意的樣子。</p>
<p>——呵，這裏原來還有樓房呢！我說。</p>
<p>隨了這話，我們的頭禁不住的揚了上去。呵，這該讓我怎樣的寫下去呢？緊靠在樓頭的房間門口，正有一個年靑的女人向我們投下了輕微的睇笑。</p>
<p>老黃大概是呆了，滿頭的水不去擦乾，儘管往上飛眼，性的飢渴燃燒了久涸的心苗，也許他要一試鋒芒吧？我想。女的倒很開通，後來，竟從容的走下來，和老黃兜搭着，從年紀上看來，她是二十以外的人了，但，她沒有一點潑刺的精神，她所有的，只是一些勉强的做作而已。</p>
<p>餘輝，被蒼茫的夜色趕去了，大地上逐漸的沉寂起來，在鎭子的外面像死去了一樣。晚飯，是在洋燭的光芒裏吃過了，為了想使精神從整日的疲乏裏振作一下，於是，把店家的烟盤子端來，挖了幾百錢的膏子，吞吐着雲霧。</p>
<p>對於燒烟，不用說，我們都是外行，烟，在我們的手裏常常地燃燒，並且，也不能如意的嵌在斗門上，心頭，滑上了焦燥的恨怒。</p>
<p>——還是我來燒吧，女的笑着，露出了兩列齊整的牙房。</p>
<p>在木框嵌就的竹片床上，圍攏着這麽幾個年春的人，不顧慮時間的速度，也忘去了四野的肅穆，甚至把明日的行程，也全部的丟在腦後了。</p>
<p>女的演述着她的身世，流離，顚沛，苦痛，以孤零零的身子在和惡魔的社會搏門，最後，她哭了，眼睛下，掛上了瑩晶的淚珠。她向老黃要求，希望能同情這不幸的身世，至少，希望他能在物質方面給些援助，當然，所謂援助也不是空洞的，她企望着用自己的肉體去換取以上的代價。</p>
<p>老黃的意思有點動搖，但沒有立卽的答復。山風帶來了使子們的鼾聲，吿訴着瓦已深了，因了友誼間應盡的本能，我用眼色給他暗示——</p>
<p>——須要當心呵，這害人的女人！</p>
<p>終於，老黃很决絕的讓她去了。含着滿腔的怒火，她在憤恨着破壞了好事的人，悻悻地走了出去，消滅在昏暗的燈光裏。</p>
<p>註：頂架，在屋項上裝好架子，預備放置轎子之類的東西。</p>
<h3 id="c188">鄉居雜記 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>日子過得好像蟻的蠕行一樣悠長而慢慢的。在鄉村裏、誰都不會否認、這是頂苦悶底一回事。當我飄吓飄的過了大浪的海面，依然投進故鄉的懷抱裏的時候，一切所給予我的感覺都是難過的，雖然我悄然的回到自己的村莊裏，看見了我那憔悴的，枯黃的臉色的可憐的母親，她那病態的老弱的身體，總是敎我痛苦的。當隔壁的姆姆跑過來看我的時侯，悄悄地告訴我：</p>
<p>「她的身體更要壞了，你看她的臉孔呀！不久以前，她病倒了，眞叫人害怕到了不得的。你流蕩的不回家已經又是兩年啦，現在該要安慰一下她吧！」</p>
<p>太意的呀！我的心靈好像被絞着一樣的。我很慚愧，然而，　有什麽辦法　　　有天曉得我的痛苦吧，在辛辣的旅途上，我不是總離不開痛苦的圈子裏嗎？現在我帶着滿身的瘡傷歸來了。看見這樣難看的媽媽，心靈裏更加浸上一層苦味的酒精，漸漸兒火似的湃漲，而且沸燒了起來了。但是，這個時候，我又煽起了一個念頭，似是咆哮，，似是憤恨，似是悲慘。我總忘不了鄉村裏的女人的一種極其自利而且多是多非的卑劣的地方，譬如我的媽媽從來沒有什麽人肯給他帮帮忙的，但是，在背後講是非的人們却多得很，總之，在鄉村裏的婦人們都是一樣沒有思想的人的。同時地，我又想起了我的哥哥，他不是一個為了母親而討了一個女人嗎？為什麽拋棄了可憐的媽媽而帶了女人到別個地方去呀！想着痛苦的氣息把，我緊緊地罩籠着了。</p>
<p>回家以後，知道到美國去了十多年的伯父已經歸來了、但當我跟他談話的時候、他好像害怕我向他借錢一樣、不一會兒便藉故離閉我走了，這是多這可笑的慳吝的人喲！是的，這些人們正是佔有了鄉村的大部分呢。我很憎恨，很不高興地就離別了可憐的家鄉，離開了可憐的母親又像沒有家的人一樣，悄悄地踏上了旅途，</p>
<p>可是，鄉村確是討厭的，當我還未曾離開了家鄉的時候，就有許多鄉紳們跟我談起鄉村裏的官訴的事兒，什么禁烟私售呀！什么人毆打呀！通姦呀！這許多的事情都要來跟我商量。他們都把我當作是從城市歸來於靑年紳士了。可是，在我的心裏，這總不過是討厭的事情，都是土豪劣紳互相攻聲的卑劣的花樣吧了。</p>
<p>離開了可憐的家鄉，跑進淸潔而繁雜的縣城裏流浪了許久，所威到的一切都不過是空洞的，除了那黨張和炎烈的氣息佔有了整個人們的呼吸以外，都不過是那迷人的却又是虛偽的大减價的牌子！跟着從南方的大海面吹過來的風飄揚。那怩忸的女人們的身子，在白色的太陽底下的光滑的士敏土的大路上提盪着，一切都跟大都會沒有兩樣的，只不過地方是那麽小，不够兩個鐘頭就够人感到苦悶的。</p>
<p>晚上，飛坐了迅速的火車，到鄉北的一個村子裏的友人處去。</p>
<p>這個地方是很淸靜的，差不多就是深山里一樣，不够兩天，我就感到沉默的疲倦，威到鄉居的極其苦悶，每天　了有三幾個小孩子們到樓子上來玩一　以外，幾乎冷靜得很凄切的。</p>
<p>夜裏，鄉村已沉醉在冷靜而黑暗的圈子裏，那高高的天空，黑漆得像一片廣漠的炭似的，小小的星兒在閃吓閃的，這時沒有犬吠的聲音，沒有人語，這兇跟不夜之城市是絕對的兩樣，多麽可怕的呀！可是，有時是例外的，撞着三兩個爛汚貨的多嘴女人在仇恨的相駡，那不斷的漫咒，難聽的話，巨聲的聲浪在充滿了夜的空間的時侯，我就憎恨她們在故意打擾人家的淸夢，心裏非常討厭的，總之，我感到，鄉村裏的沒有知識的女人們是最可怕的。</p>
<p>為了一切的不慣，我不能不很快地就離開了可憐的家鄉，又悄悄地踏　了旅途，飄吓飄的去流浪了。</p>

<p>開篇「摩登老爺」</p>
<p>近來個個尙摩登。兩字摩登記得淸。不分男女和老少。大家一律學摩登。摩登確有宣傳力。移風易俗却無形。有的說年輕女子摩登化。招搖過市像花瓶。有的說半老徐娘摩登化。一趨一步亦婷娉。有的說少爺學得摩登化。交際塲中興倍增。有的說太太也來摩登化。定然是西山日落近黃昏。我說道漸流原是無定向。太太摩登何足憑。有個老爺是行年六十稱家主。也會好奇學摩登。國產絲綢全不用。說什麽蘇杭綢緞與羅綾。西裝革履都是來路貨。白衣人香水發奇馨。額角頭上有電車路。裏圍外園不分明。　髮鷄皮都忘却。白玉霜擦得一層層。飲食起居齊改變。時交冬令還吃冰洪淋。老爺是年老糊塗風流甚。另覓專房作小星。一樹梨花殘照裏。海案雖好不成春。儘管天天修胡子。頷巴上總是黑沈沈。也學卿卿我我語。霓裳隊裏笑劉伶。紙醉金迷常夢夢。一天沒有片刻醒。林肯喇叭鳴鳴響。道奇車歸號要大天明。家中陳設不必說·小房間裝點也盡摩登·全家老小齊好笑·婆口苦心　不聽·說道是小姐少爺還當令。老爺是實在不應該。十行下效為家法。不多時。好家庭變做惡家庭。遺產雖多難持久。　襄原是有相仍。坐吃三年海要乾。一塲春夢付幽冥。所以是摩登兩字砒霜毒。比較自由要　十分。願大家不少盡摩登。</p>

<p>— 谷口吉郎著張廣正譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>所謂現代建築的外觀，會令人過份地感到乾燥無味。於枯燥的外觀中，情緒的豐富頓失，影響人們對於社會生活抱不安的心情。這樣的批評，常洋洋盈耳。</p>
<p>但在沒有作如是批評之前，我人必須對所謂建築家現代的傑作底新建築」加以深入的探究。面對現代建築簡潔的姿態及單純而無技巧，不期然會發生建築家的苦心究用在那裏的疑問。而一般抱那簡直是極易設計的粗劣作品的念頭的人，可說决不在少數。</p>
<p>這是因爲在以前用以說明有名建築的詞句中，使用了許多誇張裝飾豪華的形容詞及驚嘆其技巧精緻的話語。因此，一般人的觀念，便以爲沒有裝飾的便不是美建築，沒有技巧的便不是名建築。從而一般人眼光中的建築美，便都看作如日本東照宮的絢爛的彫刻與色彩的交錯，或如羅馬彼得大敎堂的宮殿那樣大規模。其小然者，則又要求刻縷極精巧的大理石裝飾如回式（Saracenis）寺院般的密緻。然，於現代建築中面亦要求中世紀寺院般高盤的古色斑然的尖塔，或要求宮殿式豪奢欄桿的敷設；以那些爲建築美的標準而斷定缺乏裝飾上變化的現代建築爲非藝術的。這種看法，不無過甚之處。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>但是新建築家所期望的建築，却不是那種以技巧粉飾外觀的裝飾建築。反之，都將外觀置於問題之。關於此點，便發生與一般人考究建築美根本的二同。</p>
<p>現代建築的出發點，是根據「適用」。建築家所苦心孤詣設計的，却是求如何技術地解决此「適用」問題。如何滿足內部的要求，而以此點爲形成外觀的要素。故外觀不過是內部要求的表現。</p>
<p>例如，因光綫射入的必要，窗的大小與方向，便爲日光照射的方向部位的關係所决定；此外，於正面開啟裝飾華麗的窗門以街耀外觀，反不是必要的。同時，又因通風換氣的必要，故對窗的構造，開啟的方法等各細點，皆給與技術的注意；此外，粉飾窗的曲線模樣的技巧，却成爲阻害光綫射入及妨害通風的不必要物。正門口，則以出入交通便利爲目的而選定其位置；此外，爲了外觀的堂煌，不顧敷設地位之不便而構築於正面的中央部，在現代建築看起來，那簡直是違反建築的根本精神。根據內部交通的考究，連絡及其能率而定各室之配置，因之外觀上毫沒有拘束於以前的形式而主張左右對稱的必要。</p>
<p>今日建築家所抱的態度是這樣：祇在官衙建築等方面，依照那所謂左右對稱可於外觀上生嚴正威念的觀點，攙以左右對稱爲必要的設計條件。故雖在敷設地方的關係上是處於不合算的塲合，但仍設立正面中央的大門。取向左右伸延兩翼的方法，而甘冒內部發生的機能上的不便。是卽以外觀而决定組合內部的方法。那當然須要藝術的建築家處理的。同時，那也可以說是爲了粉飾外觀，而使內部對之服從的方法。</p>
<p>現代建築的主張，與是適成相反。以解决內部爲根本問題，外觀祇爲其附屬品；已很少有人相信建築的機能將仍表現於外觀上。從而便深知以前的建築，實是畸形的建築，違背了建築的本意。於是羣起提倡建築必要機能的極端表現，纔是建築的眞姿態，纔是眞的建築美。直接呈現於視覺的外部工程材料，以能於風化中保持耐久力爲目的。於內部，則講求防阻熱的傳達具防熱性的材料。</p>
<h3 id="c201">中國古建築之内部分析（上） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 稺雲</p>
<p>建築業在中國，自十九世紀一直到現在，已有相當的發展，但比之歐美各國，那就相差萬里。在這十里洋塲的上海，雖則也有中國人自己建造的二十多層高的大廈，但內部的一切裝飾，大抵仰給於舶來品，每年的進口，算起來也很可觀的。</p>
<p>內地的一切建築物，無論是宮，殿，廟字，平民房屋等，內外的一切裝飾，完全可說自供自給，而在築建的堅固上面說，也不亞於一切洋化的建築物。</p>
<p>這裏，把中國舊建築物內部的一切裝飾物，大略的說一下：</p>
<p>（一）設計——中國廟字的建築，其形式和印度相似，包有一層層的院落，走廊，廚房，飯廳，僧舍。正式的形式，是有三個莊嚴的一層殿堂。有平行顯露的木頂。附接着有寬的階梯，拱門和橋。居室與廟宇相類，是向南的。前門出來，有一個大院落。二旁皆有房屋。另一端則有一個大廳，接着又一個院落；有的時候還有第三個院落，爲婦女而備的。後面還有花園。其一切的窗，大都，是向裏面開的。</p>
<p>門口外的「戶檻」，造法也有一定的比例，它的高低，是依照屋簷離地面的高度而定，一尺一寸；卽屋簷離地一尺。戶檻高一寸，屋簷離地二尺，則戶檻之高度爲二寸，以此類推。</p>
<h3 id="c202">混凝土船舶（下） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 徐蒲生</p>
<p>現在姑且放棄歷來各國造船計劃的史的敍述，而略舉混凝土船舶優點的所在，則航行安定而不顚簸，平時不至漏水，碰撞時易於修理，偶遇失火，難於延燒，均其顯著者也。</p>
<p>試以此與鋼船相較，就造價而論，則混凝土船平均僅爲同等載重之全鋼船舶的十分之六至八。如兩者載重噸位相等時，混凝土船的船體較大，故運輸質較體笨的一類貨物時，必較鋼船爲多。</p>
<p>混凝土船的造法。可別爲以下三種。今且拾取馮雄所著「三和土」一書中論及此類船舶之造法，簡括大意，以資介紹：</p>
<p>（一）整造法船之全部，成爲一體，情形與陸上混凝土構造物之建築相同。造船台（Slipway）之底，係由混凝土磚塊排砌，船體全用板型範成。先排列外方板型，以定船體之外形，在此板型內排置鋼條，作爲骨骼，船中橫架（Transverse　fraime）及縱桁（Longitrninal　Stringer），均按其形式，架置板型；隔艙（Brlkbead）甲板（Decking）艙口欄（Hatchway　Coaming）等均於船殼將成時造之，法亦相同。</p>
<p>（二）分造法此法在英國頗爲通行，按船體形狀，劃分爲多數之格；格框作整體，用混凝土造成，格板則分造後嵌置其內。惟也有只將主要格框作爲整體造成，而其餘格框俱分造嵌置，與造格板相同的。</p>
<p>（三）骨造法先用鋼條構成船殼的骨骼，表裏兩面，以優等混凝土墁之。（此卽Lambot第一艘混凝土船的造法，盛行於意大利國），又有採用此法而加變化者，則用鋼條組成雙層之船殼，中塡以混凝土，再將混凝土墁於表裏兩面，尤爲堅固。</p>
<p>上述三法相較，各有利弊，用之得宜，俱收良效。擇用何法，應該以船身大小和它的用途而定；大槪航海的大船，宜用整造法，而航行內河者，以骨造法爲合適。</p>
<p>人造石材的混凝土旣能製成船舶航行於汪洋大海之中，則將來如研究更深，技巧益進，以之製成飛機，征服天空，怕不是絕對不可能的事吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Central Government Holds the First Uprising Commemoration of the Premier, Luo Jialun Discusses Appealing to the Nation for Disaster Relief and to the Youth for Education <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held the Premier's first uprising commemoration meeting at 8:00 AM on the 9th. Central Committee members Zhu Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Hong Ludong, Zhou Qigang, Ma Chaojun, Huang Musong, Fu Rulin, Luo Jialun, Jiao Yitang, Chen Ce, Li Zonghuang, and party headquarters staff, as well as representatives from the National Government, all departments, and agencies, totaling over 700 people, attended. Standing Committee member Wang Zhaoming presided, and Luo Jialun delivered a report, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Forty-one years ago today, the Premier, with a compassionate heart for the hunger and suffering of the people, sought to rescue the Chinese nation from fire and water and ascend to a state of peace. Thus, he launched the first uprising in Guangzhou. Unfortunately, it failed, and martyrs Lu Haodong, Zhu Guiquan, and Qiu Sisan died heroically. However, the foundation of the revolutionary movement was thereby established. At that time, the Premier was only thirty years old, using the pure spirit and passion of youth to implement his national salvation and people's welfare program. Now, forty-one years have passed, and the Republic of China has been established for twenty-four years. Looking around at our compatriots, they are still in the midst of natural and man-made disasters, in deep water and scorching fire. When we commemorate the Premier, we truly feel heartache. All revolutionary comrades cannot help but reflect on themselves. Today, on behalf of the Central Standing Committee, I will first report on the issue of disaster relief. This flood is as severe as that of the 20th year of the Republic, and its scope is even wider. The nation's three largest rivers, the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, are almost simultaneously experiencing danger, especially the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, where the disaster is most severe. Due to the torrential rain upstream and the Xiang River area, a large portion has been submerged. Because of the flash floods of the Yi River and Luo River, the Yellow River in the Henan and Shandong area breached its banks. Even active flood control work could not withstand the raging Yellow River, so the Yellow River has the potential to seize the Huai River and the Grand Canal. The disaster area in the Jiangbei region is still expanding daily. The number of disaster-stricken areas across the country is as many as sixteen provinces, and the number of disaster victims is more than twenty-five million. Some entire counties have been submerged, and some entire villages have been flooded. Floating in the flood are entire villages of houses. Perched on treetops are groups of refugees. The bodies recovered from the water include entire families, young and old, bound together with ropes, unwilling to be separated. I saw a report from a Hanyang Arsenal employee saying that although the water at the factory had been blocked, the factory was surrounded by floodwaters, and the sound of wailing could be heard day and night, which was unbearable for anyone with a human nervous system. Just think, when the country encounters such a major disaster, how can the country withstand it? When compatriots suffer such a catastrophe, can we bear to not provide assistance while living in relative abundance?</p>
<p>Under these tragic and pitiful circumstances, the central government is also doing its best to carry out relief work. For example, the Central Party Department transferring its gains from donations to be fully allocated for disaster relief is one instance. However, because the disaster area is too large and the finances are difficult, it is like a drop in the bucket, still unable to solve the problem. We cannot but appeal to the compassion of compatriots across the country. For example, this time, the central government decided to stop the annual salary increase and year-end bonuses for customs, railway, and postal personnel, and the central government civil servants uniformly donated half a month's salary, which are all last resort measures. Even soldiers who only receive food or discounted pay, while fighting hard battles, are being ordered by Chairman Chiang to donate at least twenty cents of their salary each, which all comes from the same motivation of treating people as one's own and cherishing all things. Everyone must know that the lives of many civil servants are very difficult, but under very serious circumstances, everyone must have extraordinary determination. It must be known that the salaries of civil servants are all borne by the people's blood and sweat. If the people's lives are not even guaranteed, how can there be civil servants' positions? Everyone must not sleep on the molten lava erupting from a volcano and think they are safe. Although everyone feels the temporary pain of saving and cutting expenses, the result of this pain is saving the lives of many who were raised from infancy by their parents. What everyone's acts of charity and righteousness are relieving are precisely the innocent and blameless compatriots who are perched on treetops and floating on the water. I saw a report in the Ta Kung Pao that even rickshaw pullers in Tianjin came out to advocate jointly donating 100 yuan for disaster relief, and I cannot help but feel boundless admiration. Just imagine how much blood and sweat it takes for rickshaw pullers to earn this 100 yuan, and how much of their lives it shortens. At the same time, seeing the Ta Kung Pao report on the prevalence of gambling among the intellectual class in a certain city, I cannot help but sigh and pray that such reports are not true. We hope that not only ordinary civil servants and the intellectual class will actively strive in this great disaster relief effort, but especially those with money and bank deposits will make extra donations.</p>
<p>As for this disaster relief fund, we must ensure that every single drop reaches the disaster victims. We hope that all disaster relief personnel will act with conscience and seek practical benefits for the disaster victims. At the same time, the central government also welcomes social supervision. For issues concerning people's lives, everyone does not need to be polite. In addition to emergency relief, we should actively pay attention to work relief and agricultural relief. If work relief is used appropriately, it can prevent future flooding. China is originally an agricultural society. After the water recedes, farmers will inevitably return to farming, so the selection and lending of seeds, and the replenishment of farming tools are all urgent problems to be solved. In addition to disaster relief personnel actively planning for the people, it is also hoped that they will closely cooperate with agricultural education and technical institutions, as well as financial institutions. In particular, it is hoped that the financial sector will transfer as much capital as possible from the cities to the rural areas.</p>
<p>Speaking of the fundamental principles for preventing floods, it is only five words: "Do not compete with water for land." Building dikes is certainly important. If it were not for the dike projects of the 21st year of the Republic, this year's Yangtze River flood would be even more unimaginable. However, the principle of "do not compete with water for land" is even more fundamental. Chairman Chiang's proposal to abolish lakeside fields a few years ago was absolutely correct. It is a pity that it has not yet been implemented, and the areas along Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake are mostly occupied by local wealthy gentry in the name of reclamation, and have not yet been abolished. Only along Tai Lake has the Jiangsu Provincial Government implemented the abolition of lakeside fields. Now that the flood is so severe, the government must have a thorough determination to implement Chairman Chiang's proposal. I have one more point to add, which is that abolishing fields and returning them to lakes is still not enough. We must also abolish fields and return them to the river. Those who have not flown over the Yangtze River basin do not know the danger of the Yangtze River, because when traveling by boat, one only sees the banks on both sides, but when looking down from an airplane, one feels that what one thinks are banks from the boat are mostly sandbars. Sandbars often extend for more than ten miles, causing the Yangtze River to narrow day by day. The formation of sandbars is partly due to the alluvium of the Yangtze River, but mostly due to the damned sand field bureaus, which use bamboo sticks and other methods to easily block the mud and sand flushed down by the Yangtze River, forming a large amount of sand fields for sale and taxation, causing the Yangtze River to be in an unmanageable state. Therefore, the work of these sand field bureaus is truly deserving of ten thousand deaths and should be thoroughly abolished before we can talk about dredging. If we can further utilize the water conservancy of the Yangtze River for irrigation, we can not only make the best use of the land, but also make the best use of the water. Talking about the Yellow River problem is naturally more complicated and cannot be solved without specialized research. Now the riverbed of the Yellow River is growing daily. In areas such as Kaifeng, the riverbed is even more than three feet higher than the city wall. What a danger this is! When I was in Dujiangyan, Sichuan, I saw Li Bing of the Qin Dynasty's teaching of "dig the riverbed deep and build the embankment low." Recalling the Yellow River, I could not help but have infinite emotion. The dredging of the Yellow River is naturally not easy because the water flow carries a large amount of sediment, and about 40% of it is deposited before reaching the sea. However, activities such as afforestation and planting grass in the upper reaches, fixing the river channel in the middle reaches, and water testing should also be actively carried out. From Jia Rang of the Former Han Dynasty's three strategies for governing the river, the best strategy was "breaching Liyang and blocking Haihai Pavilion to release the river into the North Sea," the middle strategy was "digging canals to irrigate the fields of Jizhou to quell the river's anger," and the lower strategy was "repairing the old dikes and strengthening the weak," there is still something to be learned. The first two strategies aside, for many years, the lower strategy has been implemented without thinking about the root causes, so the situation of the Yellow River has been deteriorating. In this golden, breezy, and clear autumn season, millions of young people across the country are either entering school or returning to school, which is very fortunate. But in this good fortune, everyone should recall the disaster in their hometowns, the pain of the elders being displaced, or the pain of how many young people with the same academic ability cannot enter school because of this unprecedented flood. Comparing the situation in school with the situation of young people in the disaster area, there is truly a world of difference. Can't we, these fortunate young people, have a deep sense of awakening?</p>
<p>We hope that these young people who are fortunate enough to study will, first, make full use of their study period to acquire thorough knowledge. Knowledge that is not true or thorough is the most dangerous thing. Looking at the results of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Examination, the Tsinghua Scholarship Examination, and the Ministry of Education Scholarship Examination in the past two years, it is felt that the level of university graduates is improving year by year. Although there are still those who are not good, looking at the university entrance examinations, the level of middle school graduates is still not bad. Even if one wants to lower the admission standards, there is no way to lower them. The biggest problem lies in having only a vague impression of any science and not being able to have a true understanding. It is hoped that active improvements will be made from now on, seeking to know more, and seeking to truly know each piece of knowledge that one knows. In universities or middle schools, special attention should be paid to the training of thought, and students' thinking must be thoroughly scientificized. It must not be vague, confused, or unclear. This is not only related to knowledge, but also to a person's life and conduct.</p>
<p>Second, it is hoped that young people studying can maintain their lofty ideals and have a definite view of life. Originally, the era of youth is the era of ideals. If young people have no ideals, and their eyes are only focused on material enjoyment and worldly prospects, then the future of the nation will be in extreme danger. Unfortunately, in recent years, due to the oppression of the social economy and the influence of inferior historical materialism, the lofty ideals of young people have gradually worn away. What a tragic fact this is. It is hoped that those responsible for education and the young people themselves will actively reflect and awaken.</p>
<p>Third, it is hoped that young people can create selfless personalities to express lofty ideals. If ideals are separated from reality, then ideals are fantasies. The performance of ideals does not have to be in great places, even in the smallest of places, it can be performed. As the ancients said, "If one cannot sweep a room, how can one govern the country and pacify the world?" This statement has great truth. If one's mouth curses corrupt officials every day, but one is always thinking of taking advantage of public resources, or not valuing public property, or finding ways to use public vehicles and ships without paying, what is the difference between the starting point of this kind of thinking and that of corrupt officials? All rights belong to oneself, all obligations belong to the public. This is the secret of corrupt officials. It is hoped that young people with ambition can avoid this cleanly. The talents of national leaders all depend on the cultivation of this kind of personality during the time when young people are studying.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is hoped that young people will constantly pay attention to and have a deep understanding of the world situation and the national crisis. It is certainly not right to make arbitrary claims about national affairs with incomplete knowledge, but it is also not right to become dispirited and indifferent to national affairs. The country is an organic body, and one's career is closely related to the overall situation. It is absolutely not right to ignore it. Morale should not be frivolous, but it should also not be depressed. When Fan Zhongyan was a scholar, he took the world as his responsibility. Taking the world as one's responsibility is naturally a bit too much, but if one does not feel the seriousness of one's responsibility for national affairs, then the country is finished.</p>
<p>Fifth, it is hoped that young people will pay special attention to military training and physical education. In emerging nations, young people cannot but undergo arduous, hard-working, disciplined, and orderly training. A healthy youth must rely on a healthy body. Therefore, during this year's Double Tenth Festival, the 6th National Games will be held. This is definitely not just a competition, but a training of the minds and bodies of young people. Speaking of military training, it is even more important. A life of discipline is the foundation of a civilized society. Moreover, China is in a period of severe national crisis. During the last European war, Britain organized a large army, and its lower-level cadres relied entirely on college and middle school students to supplement them. Therefore, three months of training in the basics of being a soldier is enough. After Germany's defeat, it was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and could not have the training of more than 100,000 regular troops. Therefore, young people across the country used the name of various sports organizations to carry out military training in practice. Therefore, Germany is now able to have the organization of more than 500,000 troops as soon as it declares the abandonment of the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. Our current national situation is a hundred times more dangerous than that of Germany after the war, but we do not have this kind of treaty restriction. When we can still freely gather for training, shouldn't young people with ambition and blood double their efforts? We should think about the future, in case even this bit of freedom is gone.</p>
<p>Finally, we also hope that teachers across the country can set an example for young people, once again setting a model of knowledge in terms of scholarship, and once again setting a model of personality in terms of behavior. When the country reaches this point, the responsibility of the intellectual class should be a hundred times heavier than that of ordinary people. Any degenerate behavior or颓唐 psychology is something that the pure intellectual world should not have, and I think it will not have.</p>
<p>There is one more sentence for young people who cannot go to school or cannot afford to go to school. I advise this group of young people not to be discouraged. The most important thing for us is to be good citizens. Whether or not one goes to school is a secondary matter. Even if one graduates from university or returns from studying abroad, but one's morals are unsound and one's personality is incomplete, one is not good enough to be a good citizen. Even if there are countless such people, they will be harmful to the country rather than beneficial. A good youth, even if one does not go to school, can still serve the country in many ways. For example, this year the government resolutely launched compulsory education. The funding raised by the central government, including the Boxer Indemnity, is only 3.2 million yuan, but the funding raised by the provinces and cities themselves has surprisingly reached</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>More than 10.218 million yuan. The number of short-term primary schools increased in each province to 40,842, the number of attached classes increased to 5,051, and the number of children enrolled increased to 4.014833 million. These statistics do not include the figures from some provinces. If we can put in a little effort in this area, its effect will be much more beneficial to the country and the nation than being a small employee in the city, because this is the foundation of national and ethnic rejuvenation. In short, in this time of internal and external troubles, if we do not strive to provide disaster relief, we will be destroying our own national strength and increasing the country's infinite hidden worries when resisting foreign aggression. Therefore, the most urgent work at present is disaster relief. Youth is the foundation of the country. If the education of youth is not complete, the foundation of the country will not be solid, and there will be no hope for the future of the nation. Therefore, the basic work at present is youth education. This is something we should all pay attention to. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Misfortune of the Hong Kong-Guangdong Banking System <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The head office of the Hong Kong Guangdong Bank declared suspension of payments on the 4th of this month due to a run on the bank by overseas Chinese depositors. The bank was unable to meet the withdrawal demands. This affected the bank's branches in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, and San Francisco, which subsequently suspended operations. Other Chinese commercial banks in Hong Kong were also affected by the run. The Hong Kong National Commercial Savings Bank implemented a restriction on withdrawals, limiting depositors in the savings section to one-fifth of their deposits every ten days. Only now has the run gradually subsided. After this crisis occurred, the Ministry of Finance immediately ordered the banking associations in Shanghai and Hankou to take over the assets of the Guangdong Bank branches in those locations. However, the issue of how to manage the aftermath remains to be planned.</p>
<p>The decline in the Guangdong Bank's operations has been going on for some time. Reading the bank's business reports makes this evident. In terms of liabilities, the public reserve fund item was still listed at 1.1 million yuan at the end of the 21st year. By the end of the 22nd year, this item no longer existed. As for the deposit item, it was over 31.6 million yuan at the end of the 20th year, but decreased to over 25.4 million yuan the following year. It further decreased to over 21.6 million yuan the year before last, and then to over 16.2 million yuan last year. This is a sharp decrease of about one-half compared to four years ago. In terms of assets, the cash on hand was over 11.8 million yuan at the end of the 20th year, but decreased to over 8.3 million yuan the following year. It further decreased to over 7.1 million yuan the year before last, and then to only over 2.1 million yuan last year. This is a sharp decrease of more than three-quarters compared to four years ago. The amount deposited with counterpart banks in other locations was over 10.7 million yuan at the end of the 20th year, but only over 3.1 million yuan remained last year. This is a decrease of about 70 percent. The loan item was over 16.4 million yuan at the end of the 20th year, over 15.6 million yuan the following year, over 13.7 million yuan the year before last, and then over 12.7 million yuan last year. This is a decrease of only one-fifth over four years. The total receipts and payments were over 49.5 million yuan at the end of the 20th year, decreased to over 41.1 million yuan the following year, further decreased to over 32.1 million yuan the year before last, and then decreased to over 26.7 million yuan last year. This is a decrease of about 47 percent over four years. From the disappearance of the public reserve fund, it can be asserted that the bank suffered considerable losses several years ago. It is likely that the entire public reserve fund was used to offset the losses. The sharp decrease in the various asset items is clearly due to the outflow of deposits. In addition, it is worth noting the weakening and stagnation of loans. This phenomenon proves that the bank's loans are frozen and difficult to recover.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Bank and the Hong Kong National Bank are both registered with the Hong Kong government and use the Hong Kong dollar as their base currency. Their internal organization, accounting system, and business strategies differ slightly from other Chinese commercial banks. These so-called Hong Kong-Guangdong banking systems have their own distinct banking system and have historically had special influence in the Guangdong business community. However, there have been many bankruptcies over the past decade. Early examples include the Gongshang and Huashang banks, and more recently, the Wuhua (Shanghai branch) and Jiahua banks. The Guangdong Bank, which was known for its long history and strong capital in the system, has now declared suspension of operations under the guise of reorganization. This can truly be said to be a misfortune for the Hong Kong-Guangdong financial community. This is probably a manifestation of the economic decline of Hong Kong and Guangdong. However, part of the reason still lies in the unsound organization and management techniques of the banks in this system. It is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep has been lost. From now on, Hong Kong and Guangdong bankers should know how to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e20">The League of Nations Considers Imposing a Disguised Protectorate on Abyssinia, Five-Nation Committee Currently Considering <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the five-nation committee of the League of Nations Council, which is dealing with the Italian-Abyssinian problem, is currently considering implementing a protectorate system for Abyssinia, with Abyssinia becoming a protectorate of Italy. The method is similar to the treaty signed between Britain and Iraq in 1930. However, the concern is that the Emperor of Abyssinia may not be willing to sign such a treaty, and may not even be able to sign such a treaty. The Daily Telegraph further stated that Britain cannot accept any proposals that seek to resolve the current crisis by allowing Italy to maintain a military occupation of Abyssinia. (Havas News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers on Sunday unanimously discussed the development of the Italian-Abyssinian case in vivid language, but were pessimistic about the future of the matter. They believed that the five-nation committee may not be better than the three-nation conference in Paris. The Geneva correspondent of the Volfr newspaper stated that most delegations in Geneva also hold this view. Mussolini's policy is to delay the agenda, wait for the disintegration of the Council, and then take the opportunity to attack Abyssinia. If the League of Nations encounters an attack on Abyssinia, it will take sanctions and gain the support of most governments. At this time, if Italy still insists on fighting, Britain will send troops to occupy the western part of Abyssinia, thereby protecting its interests. Sir Eden has hinted that the British fleet is prepared to respond to the situation, which has caused a deep impression. According to a certain source in Geneva, this demonstration will force Italy to return to the League of Nations. If sanctions are put into practice, it will show the world that no country, if it insists on its own way and is unwilling to listen to the wishes of other countries, can escape the sanctions stipulated in the entire League of Nations treaty. After the Italian-Abyssinian war reports are released, it can be predicted that world opinion will favor sanctions. Bodinna, a diplomatic reporter for the Paris Echo, also stated that world opinion does not approve of Italy's actions. Britain's military preparations, both at sea and on land, are precise and may be far greater than those prepared to be announced. (National News Agency, Ninth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The 16th Annual Assembly of the League of Nations opened at 10:55 this morning. Chairman Qi Naga of Argentina, who is also the chairman of the Council, delivered the opening speech. He first stated Argentina's efforts in the past to maintain peace, especially its efforts to mediate the Grand Chaco dispute. He then briefly described the activities of the League of Nations over the past year, such as proposing to send international troops to the Saar region to maintain order during the plebiscite to determine whether it should belong to France or Germany, and achieving a peaceful solution. Later, when King Alexander of Yugoslavia visited France, he was assassinated in Marseille. At that time, the international situation was extremely tense, but peace was maintained thanks to the efforts of the League of Nations. Today, the League of Nations is once again discussing a difficult dispute, namely the Italian-Abyssinian problem. "In short, the progress of the League of Nations may be delayed, and the past discussions of international disputes by the League of Nations may be forgotten, but it has been proven since the past fifteen years that all international issues are interconnected and inseparable, and that international issues must be discussed openly based on justice and honor. The past secret diplomacy is no longer applicable and must be replaced by open diplomacy. These are the gains since the establishment of the League of Nations. The Congress has become the basic organization for safeguarding good relations between nations. If this mission can be adhered to, then even if the international situation is sometimes dim, the League of Nations will be able to overcome all difficulties and regain light."</p>
<p>After Chairman Qi Naga finished his speech, the Assembly extended the meeting by one hour. When the meeting resumed, it immediately began to elect the chairman. As a result, Czech Foreign Minister Pi Yishi was elected with 54 votes against 49 votes. Yesterday, it was expected that after Yang Xiao was elected, Qi Naga would congratulate Pi Yishi, and Pi Yishi took office as chairman amidst applause from representatives of various countries. He also made slight revisions to the agenda of the Assembly, and removed the issue of the embargo on arms exports to various countries, "and included the Grand Chaco dispute and the draft convention on the suppression of political prisoners on the agenda. The Assembly adjourned at 1:11 p.m., and the next meeting was scheduled to continue at 5:30 p.m. (Havas, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Czech Foreign Minister Pi Yishi was re-elected as the official chairman. Pi stepped onto the podium amidst cheers from the crowd and declared in a brief speech, "I believe that we will be able to find a new path to peace, eliminate difficulties, and emerge victorious." Italian Representative Arosic and British Foreign Secretary Hall were among the first to arrive at the meeting. (Reuters, Ninth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Italian Ambassador to Germany, Adolies, was originally scheduled to present his credentials in three weeks. The German government, at the request of the Italian government, held the ceremony for presenting the credentials to German leader Hitler yesterday. This shows that Italy is now urgently seeking friendship with Germany. This matter was initially kept secret and was only announced last night. The Italian ambassador was received by Hitler and Foreign Minister Nulte with ordinary military honors. Presenting credentials to the German leader on Sunday is something that has not happened for many years. The Italian ambassador delivered a sincere speech, expressing his hope that the two countries would cooperate in friendship and mutually benefit. In his reply, Hitler stated that fascism and National Socialism shared the same goals. At Hitler's invitation, the Italian ambassador will travel to Nuremberg today to attend the annual congress of the National Socialist Party. Apart from the Italian ambassador, only the Polish representative is attending this congress. (Reuters, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The new Italian Ambassador to Germany, Adorigo, paid a visit to Hitler this morning to present the German leader with his letter of credence and the letter of recall of the former Ambassador, Serpenti. Mr. Ado issued a statement to Hitler in which he stated: "From what I feel, Europe and the countries of the world are now experiencing an important period in history and that the relations between Italy and Germany are particularly important to peace and international equilibrium. Italy is proceeding with a vast undertaking aimed at rendering more firm her power and prestige. Italy now requests that all countries understand her legitimate interests, just as she understands the legitimate interests of all other countries". In his reply, Mr. Hitler stated: "Italy and Germany's relationship is critical to the future political development and effective peaceful cooperation among all countries. I share the same sentiment with you on this issue. Further, I believe that justice and mutual understanding are necessary for the existence of all peoples. Only once that is understood can cooperation between countries be discussed. The ideals that Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany embrace are largely identical, and therefore the relationship between the two countries will surely become more and more smooth, benefitting all countries of the world. This is what I deeply value". (Havas Dispatch, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A well-known humorous weekly in Munich was confiscated by the police today for publishing a satirical drawing about the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, depicting Death wielding a scythe in a field and shouting, "Only I am the big winner in East Africa!" The attitude of the German authorities is that Germany intends to be friendly with the major powers and has nothing to do with the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, so it does not want to hurt the feelings of the Italians.

The crowd shouted, "To Italy, to Italy!" Mussolini smiled broadly upon hearing this and appeared very happy. He then retreated into the palace, but the crowd outside continued to cheer. Mussolini then came out to the balcony again and asked if they wanted to meet for a moment longer. The crowd all shouted "Yes, yes!" After Mussolini retreated into the palace again, the welcomers continued to cheer for a considerable time before finally dispersing. (National News Agency Dispatch, Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - Italian troops were heavily defeated by Abyssinian troops at Apokwa in 1896. If Italy goes to war with Abyssinia this time, its primary goal will be to avenge this previous defeat. It is said that the Italian army will first attack from the north. General Bono will lead a large army from Aduwa to Aksum. Abyssinian leader Siymum has 35,000 soldiers stationed there. Siymum seems to intend to resist for some time, allowing the Italian army to penetrate deeply. It is said that the Italian side has 100,000 white soldiers and thousands of local soldiers gathered in Eritrea. Their front line is very long, and the flanks are at risk of being harassed by Abyssinian guerrillas. It is said that the Abyssinian side has 50,000 well-equipped soldiers stationed in Gondar. In the south, General Graziani seems to be leading a crowd of 100,000 soldiers, advancing cautiously. However, the Italian soldiers are suffering greatly from the heat, and many are sick. Therefore, before the actual attack, it seems that reinforcements are still needed to help. The strategy of the Abyssinian army in the south is still undecided. It is likely that the main resistance will be staged before the important town of Harar. (Reuters Dispatch, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - The Italian government has decided to withdraw consulates from various locations. Foreigners in the Abyssinian capital believe that this is not a good omen, and they feel even more uneasy as the Italian embassy continues to prepare to return home. The Abyssinian Emperor guarantees the safety of Italian embassy and consular staff and prohibits all anti-Italian demonstrations. Official circles here did not express alarm after hearing the news of the withdrawal of the Italian consulates, believing that most of the consular staff carried equipment such as radio stations and engaged in espionage work. Among the Italian consuls who returned home last week was Consul Heibblamaco Falgoni of Kafa Province. Mr. Fa was injured in a hunting accident recently and was not fully recovered when he returned home. (National News Agency Dispatch, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - Due to the serious situation, the Italian Embassy in Abyssinia has been specially authorized to advise Italian expatriates scattered in the interior of Abyssinia to concentrate in the Abyssinian capital to prevent accidents. However, the Italian clerics in the Kafa province will temporarily reside in the province, pending further orders. (Havas Dispatch, Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Prospects Dim for Another Stresa Conference: Doubts in Geneva <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) News reports from Rome state that Mussolini is willing to hold another conference in Stresa to discuss a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. People in Geneva are quite skeptical about this. No formal proposal of this nature has yet been received. However, as the League of Nations' special five-member committee is currently dealing with the issue, a Stresa conference seems unlikely to materialize. Moreover, the previous Paris conference ended in failure, and the lessons learned from that event serve as a warning. The special five-member committee will meet today in a more difficult atmosphere than last week. While the committee is holding closed-door meetings, the League of Nations General Assembly is likely to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute openly. There is a general hope that the Assembly will not issue any radical statements that would create new obstacles for the committee. (Reuters Dispatch, Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The five-member committee of the League of Nations, which is handling the Italian-Abyssinian problem, has encountered conflicts of interest, which has hampered Britain's determination to make new recommendations to Italy. British representative Eden had urged the committee to submit a compromise plan to the League of Nations Council by September 14. Sources in London also stated that the British Cabinet fully supports Eden. Eden's attitude is becoming increasingly firm. However, Eden still faces several difficult problems that may prevent him from achieving his goals: (1) France is deeply concerned that excessive haste will jeopardize the newly harmonious French-Italian relations if a compromise cannot be reached, and French representative Laval expects Italy to reject any proposals for concessions. (2) Spain, while always adhering to strict moral principles, must also take into account its interests in Africa and the Mediterranean. However, Spanish representative Madariaga will likely focus on moral aspects and support Britain. (3) Turkey, like Soviet Russia, believes that the proposals of Britain and France are quite suspicious. However, Turkey and Italy also have a rivalry for dominance in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. (4) Poland, while always loyal to the League of Nations, is also showing a hesitant attitude. Italian representative Alosi has publicly stated that Poland is the most friendly member of the committee. The League of Nations General Assembly will open on Monday, and all peace efforts will proceed in unison. It is said that representatives of several small countries have decided to use the full force of the Assembly to prevent war. However, Irish Free State representative President Fan Lela has lost hope of becoming the chairman of the Assembly after announcing that he would fight to the end for this cause. It is likely that Czech representative Pixuan Shi will be elected as chairman at that time. (National News Agency Dispatch, Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo: Rickert, who handled the negotiations for the 75-year Ethiopian oil concession contract, ran out of gasoline today while driving from Suez to Cairo, about thirty miles from Cairo, and was unable to proceed. An interviewer from the Paris Concorde Daily witnessed this and inquired about the oil concession. Rickert replied that the Ethiopian oil and mining rights issue was very simple, but he doesn't understand how it became such a complex matter. He has received telegrams regarding new methods, but no decision has been made yet. When Rickert arrived in Suez earlier, he declined to comment and refused to answer reporters' questions, but said that the Ethiopian oil and mining rights he successfully negotiated would eventually start construction. He also said that he would arrive in London around September 15, at which time he could make a very detailed statement. (8th Reuters)</p>

<p>Baton Rouge, USA: Senator Huey Long, the political autocrat of Louisiana, was shot suddenly in the state capitol today. The bullet pierced his stomach. Long's bodyguard immediately returned fire, killing the assailant on the spot. It was later learned that the assailant was a local surgeon named Weiss, the son-in-law of Judge O'Berry, a leader of the anti-Long faction. After Long was injured, he was taken to the hospital, where he underwent surgery. According to the doctors, the bullet had already passed through, and the injuries were not serious. (8th National News Agency)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge: Senator Huey Long, a Democrat who is referred to as the "dictator of Louisiana," was suddenly attacked here and seriously injured. At the time, Long was on his way to the Louisiana House of Representatives to attend an extraordinary session because several bills that would increase Long's dictatorial power were to be introduced for discussion at today's meeting. Long was attending the meeting to try to ensure that these bills would pass, but as he walked along the passage connecting the State Senate and House of Representatives, someone suddenly pulled out a gun and shot him, hitting Long in the abdomen, causing heavy bleeding. He was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, and it is said that the injuries are quite serious. After the assailant fired the shot, Long's guards immediately arrested him. The assailant is a young man named Dr. Weiss, 30 years old, and is the son-in-law of State Judge Bowie. Rumors of a plot to assassinate Long have been circulating for some time. Long himself mentioned the matter in the Washington Senate, saying that several people had conspired to harm him in a hotel in New Orleans. This was overheard by Long's brother, who secretly used a radio in the next room to record the entire conspiracy on a recording. At the time, someone was heard saying, "Killing Long only requires one person, one gun, and one bullet. I'm prepared to draw lots to get this job." It was also heard that the mayor of New Orleans, Walmsley, was aware of the matter. However, Long did not care after learning of this plot. When other senators inquired about it, Long just smiled and said, "These things are like insuring my longevity, what is there to fear?" Unexpectedly, there was actually an assassination attempt today. However, whether this assassination is the result of the aforementioned conspiracy cannot be verified at this time.

<p>American Senator Long</p>
<p>Baton Rouge: Louisiana's uncrowned emperor, Senator Huey Long, was shot last night in the state capitol by the son-in-law of a political enemy. Fortunately, only one shot was fired, and the weapon malfunctioned, so he was spared a fatal wound. After Long was shot, blood spurted from his mouth, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. The assassin was Dr. Weiss, 30 years old, an ear, nose and throat doctor. After firing the shot, he was immediately killed by Long's guards with a submachine gun. Weiss was struck by forty bullets and died instantly. After Long was admitted to the hospital, the doctors determined that he had lost too much blood and could not be saved without a blood transfusion. More than a hundred people volunteered to donate blood. The doctors then tested their blood and selected several people. While Long was receiving the blood transfusion, he was delirious, but an hour later, he was able to talk to the doctors. This morning, the hospital issued a statement saying that Long's condition was satisfactory. The State legislature only convened at night to pass several of the bills sponsored by Long. Long has been one of the most colorful figures in American history for many years. He used all his strength to destroy the power of the opposition party to control the Louisiana legislature. As a result, the Louisiana legislature was reduced to an organization that only followed Long's orders. Long has eloquence and sweeps through thousands of men, able to cater to the psychology of the masses and gain their support. Long's theory of "sharing the wealth" made many people fantasize about future prosperity. Long regarded President Roosevelt as a formidable opponent, so he often spoke out against him. He recently stated that if Roosevelt or Hoover were nominated again next year, he would organize a third party and compete for the presidency. Long's unconventional behavior is known throughout the world. Once, when the captain of a German warship paid a formal visit, Long greeted him in casual clothes, causing an international diplomatic joke. Long is currently 42 years old.

<p>Baton Rouge: Senator Huey Long was attacked today in the Louisiana legislature, and it is reported that his injuries are very serious. Long's abdomen has been pierced, and his large intestine has been injured in two places. Doctors fear that Long may develop peritonitis. At the same time, blood is constantly flowing from Long's wound, so the chances of recovery are difficult to predict at this time. Everything will depend on the outcome of the blood transfusion therapy. Long received blood transfusion therapy shortly after being admitted to the hospital. The blood donor was a friend of Long's. Later news said that Long's condition was slightly better. (8th National Electric)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge: Senator Huey Long, the political dictator of Louisiana, has begun an attack on the federal government over the state government's powers. He convened the state legislature, held a special session, and introduced 31 bills. One of them would prohibit federal agents from exercising powers outside the Constitution in the state, with violators subject to a fine of 1,500 and imprisonment for one year. Another bill would allow the state government to sue the central government when the rights of the state government are taken away. Some observers believe that Long's actions are the biggest challenge to the federal government since the American Civil War. Long said today that he may ask the Supreme Court to rule on whether to ban New Deal personnel from working in Louisiana, and said that the federal government should not oversee elections in Louisiana.

<p>(New York) Former U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Brackenridge today severely criticized the U.S. silver policy, calling it a "gambling" scheme by the government, and said that China's financial panic was a direct result of the U.S. silver policy, while the only beneficiaries of this policy were speculators and a small number of silver mine owners. However, in fact, the U.S. silver mining industry is insignificant, and even the number of hairpin workers is greater than the number of silver miners. Brackenridge severely rebuked the representatives of a very small number of western states for wasting national money and creating opportunities for speculators. This policy is causing silver to flow out of China, creating deflation, and harming all businesses. (8th National Electric)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Yun, the special envoy escorting the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, along with Luo Youren, director of the Panchen Lama's office, visited President Wang at the Executive Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 7th to inquire about the procedures for returning to Tibet and the funds for the journey. Cheng Yun must wait until the funds are in place and the procedures are completed before heading north to Qinghai to meet the Panchen Lama. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Yun said that the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet has been in the works for a long time, but it has not been realized due to various reasons, and the journey is long and will take a lot of time. After a long period of preparation, the Tibetan affairs are now largely in order, and it is hoped that we can depart from Qinghai on the 15th of next month. The planned route is through Qinghai, Yushu, Xikang, and the border into Tibet. Most of the areas along the way are mountains and ridges, and the climate is cold. Not only are there few inhabitants, but there are even places where no vegetation grows. There are also several places where you can eat meat but not drink soup, and drink soup but not eat meat. Although the locals say that this is superstition, it is due to the special climate, which inevitably causes serious meat diseases. Also, there is a type of grass called "Deceitful Horse Grass" that grows everywhere in slightly warmer areas. If a horse eats it, it will die immediately, which is also a fact. Therefore, not only should people prepare sufficient food for this trip, but also horse feed to maintain the horses until we reach Tibet. We will use tents for accommodation along the way. If the weather is good and there is not much snow, we should be able to reach Tibet by the end of this year. I was ordered to escort the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, but I have limited talent and ability, and I am afraid that I will not be able to handle it. However, due to the urging of the central government and Chairman Huang, I have no choice but to reluctantly go. President Wang said that the Republic of China is composed of five ethnic groups: Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. In the past, Tibet had a deep relationship with the mainland. Although there was some estrangement in the middle, it has gradually been eliminated recently. Now, the central government has no so-called policies or methods for the local areas, only sincerity, that is, the central government sincerely protects and helps the local areas. This is true not only for Tibet, but also for Mongolia and the mainland. He instructed me to convey this meaning when I meet with the local authorities in Tibet after entering Tibet. I will leave Beijing for Qinghai at the end of the month and arrive in Qinghai on the 10th of next month, and then depart with the Panchen Lama. The earliest I can return to Beijing is next summer.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 9th that the U.S. Postal Authorities intend to renew an agreement with the Chinese Postal Authorities on the transportation of naval mailbags. According to the General Postal Administration, the International Postal Convention stipulates that warships stationed overseas may exchange sealed mailbags, but only for letters. Parcels are not included in this regulation. In recent years, the general postal mailbags exchanged between U.S. warships and the U.S. Navy stationed in various parts of China have included parcels. This is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of the convention. The request to conclude an agreement is difficult to comply with for two reasons: First, the mailing of parcels requires customs inspection and taxation, but the sealed warship mailbags are not subject to customs inspection. If parcels are sealed in warship mailbags, the customs procedures that should be followed cannot be completed. The postal service has no right to agree to this. Second, parcels for domestic delivery can be mailed from post offices across the country, so there is no need to seal them in naval mailbags. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

The company is called the "Lian'an Company, Contractor of the Additional Construction Fee of Sun Yat-sen University on Imported Cake Fertilizers for the Entire Guangdong Province," and it has undertaken to pay an annual fee of 500,060 yuan. The Lian'an Company has sent personnel to Shantou to establish the Chao-Mei Collection Office, appointing Du Ridong as the head and Wei Cuiming as his deputy. The tax collection is scheduled to begin on September 2nd. A notice has been issued to inform the grain brokers of the North and South ports. The notice states, "It has been decided that an additional fee of 25 cents per dan will be levied on imported soybean cake fertilizer for the construction fee of Sun Yat-sen University, as announced by the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner's Office. The tax collection is scheduled to begin on September 2nd, and 16 Shangheng Road has been selected as the Chao-Mei District Collection Office. All merchants transporting soybean cake into this city must first send the invoice and customs declaration to this sub-office for verification and pay the fee according to the quantity, and obtain a certificate before they can transport it by ship, train, or boat. When transferring, a declaration should be made, and a transfer certificate should be obtained, and the fee certificate should be affixed to the invoice in order to comply with the procedures. Soybean cake transported before September will be exempted from fees, but the quantity transported to various counties must be listed and registered in order to issue a transit permit; otherwise, it will be investigated and punished as leakage. As this is the beginning of the operation, it is feared that merchants may not be aware, so it is necessary to explain in detail to avoid mistakes. It is of utmost importance that all merchants comply with the above regulations and avoid penalties. This notice." After the notice was issued, merchants and people were shocked, because soybean cake is the main fertilizer. For years the farmland in Chaozhou and Meizhou feel application imported fertilizer powder fail, and all plantings use soybean cake as the sole raw material. Therefore, in the corner of Chao-Mei alone, more than seven million pieces of cake are used each year. Now, if a tax is uniformly levied, the rural villages of Chao-Mei will suddenly face an increased burden of more than 800,000 yuan, which is not in line with the government's intention to protect farmers and merchants. The Grain Association held a general meeting of all members on the 2nd to discuss countermeasures, and soybean cake merchants in Shanghai and Wuhan believe that this industry is in its infancy, and domestic cake factories must rely on the government's support and encouragement to develop. Donation merchants are only interested in profit, and they are not aware of the overall situation. They are no different from promoting the sales of imported products and will leave domestic products without any chance of survival. Therefore, they expressed dissatisfaction with this matter and have jointly implemented a strike pending a resolution. The North-South Port Cargo Transportation Association also convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures after the tax on soybean cake was implemented: (1) Request the government not to be deceived by the donor merchants and cancel the case to benefit farmers and merchants; otherwise, they will not stop; (2) All colleagues should report to the association before September 1st the number of soybean cakes they have ordered from other ports and the cake number must be noted; (3) If the donation merchant interferes with soybean cakes transported en route, they should be allowed to register them at their discretion, but the fee should not be paid immediately to facilitate negotiations; (4) Because this matter is of great importance, 15 people have been elected as executive members to be responsible for handling it. The association also sent Rao Dongming to negotiate with the donation merchant, requesting to postpone the opening of the tax on soybean cake imported after September 1st and to make temporary registration first, pending the resolution of the negotiation with the province, and then decide whether to pay. The donation merchant claimed that it would not be accepted because it related to the source of funds, and that it was impossible for Shantou to avoid it because the province had already implemented it. However, a certain foreigner became very active because of this incident and raised funds to open the Japan-Manchuria Products Co., Ltd., each share of which is 100 yuan, and Chinese are also allowed to subscribe. It is currently in progress, and it is planned to smuggle soybean cake from Dalian to Shantou for sale, seizing the market. From then on, the soybean cake industry may follow in the footsteps of oil and rice and fall into the hands of certain foreigners.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Suspected Case of a Car Crushing a Road Worker to Death</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Suzhou-Changshu Highway, there have been no unfortunate incidents. However, the other day late at night, Chen Hailin, a road worker from Shandong, was lying across the road near Lumu to cool off when a dark blue car speeding from Changshu through Suzhou crushed Chen Hailin to death. After other road workers learned of this, the car that caused the accident was nowhere to be found. The area in charge of the area reported the matter to the local court, which sent personnel to inspect the scene the following afternoon. It was confirmed that Chen Hailin had been crushed to death by a car. The third branch of the Public Security Bureau discovered a dark blue car near Penglai World on Liuyuan Road on the afternoon of the 8th. There was no one in the car, and the license plate had been removed, so there was no way to investigate who the owner of the car was. The Public Security Bureau is investigating the origin of the car. According to nearby people, there were five or six passengers in the car when it came to Suzhou, and they have disappeared after injuring people. Some say that the car may have been involved in a kidnapping.</p>
<p>Wuxi: County Government Plans to Establish Mud Figurine Factory</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wang Xun, believing that Huishan mud figurines are a famous specialty of this county and have a good reputation, but the sculpting techniques have remained unchanged, resulting in a decline in production, now plans to set up a mud-making craft model factory to focus on improving production. A plan was drawn up on the 9th and submitted to the province for approval, stipulating an initial establishment fee of 1,500 yuan and a monthly recurring fee of 350 yuan. It is estimated that income and expenditure can be offset after three years.</p>
<p>Nantong: Prison Clearing and Parole in Batches</p>
<p>Jiangsu Fourth Prison in Nantong City, under orders to clear the prison, is handling parole. Prison Warden Hu Yuling investigated and found that more than 100 male and female prisoners met the parole regulations and decided to handle them in three batches. The first batch of 20 people to be paroled has been submitted to the High Court for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Postal General Bureau: A Bold Robbery Yesterday Resulted in a Huge Loss; Bandits Fled with Pistols and Mausers After the Heist; 91,930 Yuan Stolen; Yuan Bingshu and Lu Ruilin Dead, Zhou Yucheng Wounded; Police Authorities Intensifying Investigation, Aiming to Solve the Case Shortly <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, a robbery occurred at the Postal General Bureau on the bank of the Suzhou Creek on North Sichuan Road in this city. The bandits fatally shot one clerk and one guard from the bureau, and wounded another guard. The total amount stolen reached 91,930 yuan. The details of the incident are described below:</p>
<p>Following the Usual Morning Escort of Funds</p>
<p>According to established practice, the Postal General Bureau in this city daily sends funds to the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau at No. 53 Fuzhou Road for deposit. For security, the Savings Bureau dispatches an armored car and two guards around 9:00 AM each morning to collect the funds. Yesterday, being Monday, the bureau followed the usual procedure, sending a car (Municipal License 12442, Concession License 16182) and guards, Lu Ruilin from Hubei and Zhou Yucheng from Shandong, to the General Bureau to collect the funds. At the General Bureau, the cash exchange and collection office prepared the funds collected from Saturday and Sunday, totaling 91,920 yuan, packed and sealed them securely in a mailbag, and ordered Yuan Bingshu, a clerk, to carry it downstairs to the car in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Clerk Shot Down, Silver Bag Snatched</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as Yuan Bingshu walked halfway down the stairs, two bandits suddenly emerged from the corner with guns, ordering Yuan to drop the bag. The clerk, realizing the danger, quickly tried to escape, but a gunshot rang out behind him, hitting Yuan in the lower abdomen. He fell to the cement floor beside the stairs. The two bandits quickly rushed forward, grabbed the silver bag, and fled through the small door leading to Tiantong Road to the north. At this time, guards Lu Ruilin and Zhou Yucheng were waiting by the money transport car. Suddenly hearing gunshots and seeing two bandits carrying guns and fleeing with the loot, they knew something was wrong and quickly drew their pistols, intending to fire at the fleeing bandits. However, bandits had been lying in ambush near the car. Seeing the two guards drawing guns, the bandits immediately opened fire on the guards from behind. Lu Ruilin and Zhou Yucheng, caught off guard, quickly ran into the guard room to take cover, engaging in a fierce gun battle with the bandits from behind the wall.</p>
<p>Barrage of Bullets, Guards Fall</p>
<p>Amid a barrage of bullets, the guards, unexpectedly, were unharmed. Seeing that the two guards were running out of ammunition, they chased into the guard room, firing at Lu and Zhou. Consequently, Lu Ruilin and Zhou Yucheng were both hit, bullets entering their abdomens, and they fell inside the room. The bandits then fired over ten shots into the air before leaving, also fleeing through the small door to the north. The bureau's patrol officers chased after them, firing as they went, until they reached Tiantong Road. The bandits then jumped into a taxi (Concession License 17671) waiting next to the New Asia Hotel and sped northeast. A large number of detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrived at the scene after receiving the alarm, but the bandits' car had already escaped.</p>
<p>One Dead, One Wounded Despite Treatment</p>
<p>The police quickly returned to the station and notified the fire brigade to send an ambulance to the Postal General Bureau. Yuan, Lu, and Zhou were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, Yuan Bingshu's wounds were fatal, and he died en route to the hospital. Lu Ruilin was shot twice, bullets entering his abdomen and waist. Zhou Yucheng was shot twice, one bullet hitting his liver and the other his intestines. Lu Ruilin's condition deteriorated rapidly, and he also died at 2:00 PM. Zhou Yucheng, with a bullet in his abdomen, underwent surgery to remove the bullet, but his injuries were too severe, and his condition remained critical.</p>
<p>Investigating the Bandits' Taxi</p>
<p>The Hongkou Police Station immediately telegraphed all police agencies in the city for assistance after the incident. They also reported to the Central Police Station to trace the origin of the bandits' car. It was later learned that the car belonged to the Dalei Taxi Company at No. 148 North Sichuan Road. Detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate. It was reported that around 8:40 AM that morning, a man wearing a dark blue silk long gown and a straw hat, approximately twenty years old, had rented the car. He stated that he was going to the Municipal Government Health Bureau and then to Jiangwan, agreeing to a fare of three yuan, paying a deposit of two yuan in advance. The company's accountant then ordered driver Kong Xianrong, a native of Yangzhou, to drive the car (Municipal License 4743, Concession License 17671).</p>
<p>Driver Bound, Bandits Drive Themselves</p>
<p>After the man got into the car, he ordered the driver to drive north. When the car reached the first bridge on Qimei Road, three other men wearing long gowns and short jackets got into the car. They immediately pulled out Mauser pistols, forbade the driver from making any noise, bound him with hemp rope, and pushed him out of the car. The four men then drove the car themselves south. Later, a passerby noticed and untied him. Kong quickly ran to the Linping Road Police Station to report the incident and telegraphed the taxi company. Before long, news of the robbery arrived. The police station then notified the Hongkou Police Station and took the driver in for questioning, while also ordering all detectives to be on the lookout for the car.</p>
<p>Intensified Investigation, Aiming for Quick Resolution</p>
<p>Around 1:40 PM, the car was discovered at the end of Tianbao Road in Zhabei. The Linping Road Police Station notified the Hongkou Police Station, which sent detectives to jointly inspect the scene, examine the traces in the car, and take them back for filing. The Dalei Taxi Company was then notified to retrieve the car around 3:00 PM. At the scene of the incident, the police collected several bullet casings and took them back for examination. They also dispatched additional detectives and all on-duty police officers to conduct investigations, aiming to solve the case as soon as possible. According to witnesses, the bandits were mostly wearing long gowns and spoke the dialects of Funing and Yancheng. However, their movements during the robbery were calm and methodical, suggesting they were well-organized. The bodies of the deceased clerk Yuan Bingshu and guard Lu Ruilin have been transferred from the hospital to the coroner's office. The Postal General Bureau and the Savings Bureau are currently handling their funeral arrangements. In addition to reporting the incident to the authorities and pursuing the criminals, the issue of compensation for the deceased is also under discussion.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the unresolved issue of factory inspections in the Shanghai concessions has been dragging on. This year, our representatives raised the issue at the International Labour Conference and gained international understanding. The Central Government specially dispatched Tang Jianfei, Director of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Industry, to Shanghai to consult with the Municipal Government on the steps to continue negotiations. Mr. Tang completed his mission in Shanghai and returned to Beijing by train yesterday afternoon to report on his mission. According to Mr. Tang, before his departure, he told a reporter from Dagong News Agency that the issue of factory inspections in the Shanghai concessions is unique. The issue of sovereignty involves several countries, including England, France, the United States, Japan, and Italy. Although the factories are located in the concessions, the right to conduct inspections to ensure worker safety belongs to China in terms of reason and justice. However, the lack of understanding from the authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai has resulted in the negotiations remaining unresolved. The Ministry of Industry, in order to earnestly implement the Labour Law in accordance with the Central Government's order, believes that it is necessary to resolve this outstanding issue quickly. Since international sympathy and understanding have been obtained at this year's International Labour Conference, he was specially ordered to come to Shanghai to discuss the steps and methods for continuing negotiations with the Municipal Government in order to proceed at an opportune moment. He arrived in Shanghai on the 7th and invited Cheng Haifeng, Director of the Chinese Branch of the International Labour Organization, to visit Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government for several consultations. Concrete decisions have been reached, and it is only necessary for the Municipal Government to continue negotiations with the concession authorities. It is expected that a satisfactory resolution will be reached soon. His mission has been completed, and he needs to return to Beijing to report on his mission. If necessary, he will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Distressed Overseas Chinese from Belgium Return to China, Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; A Total of Thirty-One People Were Forced to Leave the Country <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Due to the global economic downturn in recent years, overseas Chinese residing abroad have been repeatedly oppressed by foreign countries, suffering hardships that are difficult to describe. Those who have returned to China one after another are often seen. Yesterday morning, the German OolerBremen freight ship Alai arrived in port, carrying thirty-one overseas Chinese from Belgium to Shanghai, in a rather miserable state. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The ship docked at Huangpu Wharf at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. After disembarking, the overseas Chinese were guided by personnel from the relief section of the Public Security Bureau to temporarily reside at the Dongfang Hotel in Xiaodongmen. They were in a very wretched condition. Upon hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent Hou Can and Tan Zhonglu to express their sympathy. However, they were penniless and in dire straits, urgently awaiting practical relief from the authorities to avoid becoming starving corpses.</p>
<p>List of Distressed Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning included Lin Dipu, Chen Tinglian, Ji Shangyuan, Chen Zhixiu, Xu Hongguang, Jin Daan, Jin Tiyuan, Ji Shuxiang, Wu Cheng, Wang Jinting, Zhuo Chengwu, Wang Guanzong, Sun Shuidian, Fu Bosen, Xia Liangqing, Ji Yanlian, Chen Zhifu, Chen Guikai, Zhuo Jinxiong, Jin Fengen, Yang Guocai, Lin Qingtao, Ye Zhanglian, Zhou Meicai, Liu Junyi, Ni Zhikui and his wife (Belgian) and two young children. Except for Fu Bosen and Zhuo Jinxiong, who are from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, the rest are from Qingtian, Zhejiang. There were also Liu Weifan from Hubei and Jiang Guojie from Jiangsu, who were students in Belgium, and were also forced to return, totaling twenty-one people.</p>
<p>Reasons for Forced Departure</p>
<p>Lin Di, a representative of the distressed overseas Chinese, told a reporter from the Industry and Commerce News that they had been living in Belgium for many years, mostly running small businesses, with a considerable history. Unexpectedly, Belgium was also affected by the economic downturn. With a sharp increase in the number of unemployed people in the country, the government, in order to settle the general unemployed population, used the pretext of checking passports that did not conform to the requirements to force them to leave the country. Ling Qihan, our country's acting minister to Belgium, negotiated with the Belgian government several times, but to no avail. As a last resort, Ling Qihan arranged to purchase ship tickets on their behalf. On July 23rd, they boarded the German OolerBremen freight ship Alai in Hnese, Belgium, passing through the Netherlands, Italy, the Suez Canal, the Indian Ocean, Little Luzon, Singapore, and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Planning Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Before leaving Belgium, the thirty-one distressed overseas Chinese had been telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the embassy in Belgium. After learning about the situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Shanghai Municipal Government and ordered the relief section of the Public Security Bureau to provide relief. The registration process was immediately started to provide appropriate relief. It is now learned that, in addition to covering hotel expenses, the authorities are also planning to arrange ship tickets to send them back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>Since the oil cake and miscellaneous grain merchants opposed the Guangdong Province's increase in the bran tax, they have collectively suspended operations and transportation. They once sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and the central ministries and commissions agreed to telegraph Guangdong to stop it. However, according to the Guangdong Miscellaneous Grain Association, the association had requested various agencies, including the Si Nan Political Affairs Committee, to cancel it, but the request was not approved. Therefore, the suspension of operations and transportation has not been resolved.

Oil cake and miscellaneous grain merchants and transporters from various places have rescheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM this afternoon to hear the report of the delegation's petition and re-elect representatives to continue petitioning in Guangdong Province.</p>

<p>The end of September, the settlement period for commercial accounts, and the end of October, the long-term loan period for the money trade, are rapidly approaching. The Money Trade Association held an autumn experience meeting yesterday to discuss business and reforms, and also held the 47th meeting of the second executive committee to prepare for the second re-election. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Trade Autumn Experience Meeting</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association held an autumn experience meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the Inner Garden of the South City. Managers from 55 companies, including Fu Yuan, Shen Yuan, Rui Chang, Yi Chang, Fu Kang, Zi Kang, Zi Feng, Hong Feng, Dou Chang, Bin Feng, Qing Cheng, Da De, Zhi Yu, Yi Da, Shun Kang, Dun Yu, Tong Yu, Tong Run, Da Mai, Yuan Sheng, Ren Chang, Hui Feng, Zhen Tai, and Cheng Yu, and Pei Yunqing, Liu Wuqiao, etc., attended. Qin Runqing presided over the meeting, and Ge Huaiqing took the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the state of decline of the money trade and various industries. Then, they exchanged views on matters that should be promoted and reformed within the money trade. The long-term credit loans due at the end of October were also discussed, but no decisions were made. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Executive Committee Meeting to Prepare for Re-election</p>
<p>The 47th meeting of the second executive committee, originally scheduled to be held today, was held early yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM.

The committee members also toured the famous scenic spots in the Inner Garden.</p>
<p>Busy Settlement in September</p>
<p>The settlement period for industry and commerce was originally divided into the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the year-end settlement period for the Lunar New Year's Eve. After the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, the settlement period was divided into the end of June, the end of September, and the year-end settlement period for the end of January. The settlement period for the end of September this year is rapidly approaching. Companies and businesses are sending people to collect outstanding payments from various customers. They are busy with settlements these days and are issuing invoices. Since the implementation of the 5 million yuan in industrial and commercial credit loans, Shanghai's industry and commerce will be able to weather the settlement period at the end of September. At that time, the receipts and payments of the money and silver trades will inevitably be busier, as companies and businesses return outstanding payments to banks and money shops after receiving payment.</p>
<p>Various Industries Prepare for Long-Term Loans in October</p>
<p>Long-term credit loans in the money trade were originally divided into the end of March and the end of September. After the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, it became the end of April and the end of October.

The proceeds were 465 yuan. After deducting 63 yuan for mounting painting costs, the net balance was 402 yuan. At the end of the exhibition, the volunteers had all disbanded, so the funds did not need to be remitted. It was discussed at the 66th meeting of the hall's affairs committee, and it was agreed that the proceeds from the sale of famous artists' works for the purpose of assisting the volunteers should be handled with caution. It was decided to build a building related to national humiliation on the vacant land within the hall to leave a permanent memorial. However, just as the proposal was being finalized, this hall was ordered to relocate, so the construction could not be carried out</p>
<p>Relief is Saving Lives - Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life. immediately. It has been almost two years since the postponement. Although there is no definite date for the relocation of this hall, construction is still difficult to start. At this time, the flood is spreading across the two regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and the number of starving and drowning compatriots exceeds tens of millions. Donating to relief efforts is the duty of everyone. Moreover, moving the funds from assisting the volunteers to relieving the affected compatriots is an act of patriotism and saving the people. It is believed that it will be supported by the famous artists who donated the works. Therefore, it was decided at the 81st meeting of the hall's affairs committee to donate all 426 yuan of the principal and interest from the sale of the charity painting and calligraphy exhibition to the National Flood Relief Association to relieve the victims. The 426 yuan donation has been remitted by the Bank of Communications and is requested to be forwarded, and a receipt is requested. In addition to a special letter stating the process of the donation, it is hoped that it will be published in your newspaper to facilitate widespread knowledge, and please forward this letter to the Flood Relief Association as a basis.

<p>The Second All-Line Representative Assembly of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union of this line was held yesterday morning. As this day was the anniversary of the Premier's First Uprising, the Special Party Branch of the railway first held a memorial meeting for the Premier's First Uprising. Among those who signed in were Central Representative Wu Lanxi, Ministry of Railways Representative Han Jingyuan, Executive Committee members Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Song Chuanji, Feng Qihua, and Wang Weixia from the Special Party Branches of both lines, Secretary Xie Chengyu, Railway Bureau Director Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng, Police Chief Ma Shaoping, Heads of various departments and sections, Representative Zhao Yu, and others, totaling ninety-six people, as well as all staff members of the assembly secretariat, and representatives and guests from various organizations such as Zhou Xuexiang, Lu Kepeng, and Wang Yalen, totaling over three hundred people. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Premier's Uprising Commemoration</p>
<p>The Premier's First Uprising Commemoration Meeting was opened, chaired by Chen Chengshi, Standing Committee Member of the Party Branches of both lines. After the meeting was opened according to protocol, a report was immediately made on the events of the Premier's First Uprising and the significance of the commemoration, roughly as follows: "The Premier launched an uprising in Guangzhou on September 9th, seventeen years before the founding of the Republic of China, but it tragically failed due to improper handling of weapons. Martyrs such as Lu Haodong, Qiu Si, and Zhu Guiquan sacrificed their lives. The Premier went to Japan with Zheng Shiliang. This was the Premier's First Uprising. We are holding this commemoration today, coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the Premier's passing, at a time when the nation is facing difficulties, with natural disasters and man-made calamities pressing down upon us. We should invigorate the spirit of the Party, strive to save the nation from its current plight, deeply reflect on ourselves, uphold the Premier's legacy, strive for the well-being of our Party comrades, boost the revolutionary spirit, and overcome the current national crisis."</p>
<p>Opening of the Representative Assembly</p>
<p>At 9:20 AM, the opening ceremony was held, chaired by Zhao Yu, Cai Wanquan, Wu Renfu, Yao Xiaojiang, Hong Desheng, and four others. Wu Renfu and Zhao Yu served as chairmen, Wang Cheng and Tang Xiongjie as recorders, and Huang Rui as the master of ceremonies. After opening the meeting according to protocol, Chairman Wu Renfu respectfully read the Premier's will.</p>
<p>The Chairman's Opening Address was followed by the opening address of Chairman Zhao Yu, which stated roughly as follows: "Today, our railway union is holding its Second All-Line Representative Assembly, which is of extraordinary significance. Looking back at the First Assembly of our railway union, its organizational members included clerks and staff, which was inconsistent with the Trade Union Law, and it was never officially registered. The organization was not perfect, so the higher-level Party branch presented a request to the Central Committee to send personnel to carry out reorganization, which has now been over half a year. With the guidance and supervision of the higher-level Party branch and the Railway Bureau, and the efforts of the instructors and reorganizers, after actively implementing the reorganization, we are able to formally hold the opening ceremony of the Second All-Line Representative Assembly today. We feel infinite joy and hope. We should pool our efforts to provide a place for over ten thousand railway workers to rely on and follow, and with one heart and one mind, the future is bright. How can we ensure the permanent health of the two railway unions? This requires the careful and thorough consideration and active efforts of all representatives, and we hope that the Central Committee, the Ministry, and the officials of the Party branch and the Railway Bureau will provide guidance and support."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Central Representative were given by Central Representative Wu Lanxi, roughly as follows: "Comrade workers, today I am honored to participate in your grand ceremony on behalf of the Central Committee, and I feel infinite joy and honor. In this time of national crisis, I would like to offer two suggestions to all of you for our joint efforts: (1) To enhance national consciousness and jointly seek the independence, freedom, and equality of our Chinese nation; (2) When we do things, we should focus on the big picture and start with the small details. We should always use this as a principle, no matter what we do; (3) To increase national production and strengthen national power. During this national crisis, all domestic industries are lagging behind. We should accomplish two days' work in one day's time, work hard, and catch up. Only then can our nation be revived."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Representative of the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Instructions were given by Han Jingyuan, Representative of the Ministry of Railways, roughly as follows: “According to the regulations of the Trade Union Law, railway workers must hold a representative assembly once a year. However, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Unions have not held a second assembly as scheduled since the first representative assembly in September 1931, after four years, due to various reasons. Now, through the efforts of the comrades of the special party branches of the two lines, the responsible personnel of the railway bureau, and all the representatives, and after a long period of reorganization, the second representative assembly can be convened today, and the difficulty of the process is even more commendable. I am deeply honored to participate in this precious gathering on behalf of the Ministry of Railways. The two lines connect the political center of the country, the capital, and the economic center, Shanghai, and their importance is the highest in the country. Therefore, the development of the two lines is of great importance to the country's political and economic relations. If we want to promote the development of railway business, there are two necessary conditions: one is material conditions, and the other is human conditions. Comparing the two, the latter is more important than the former. Because under the same material conditions, whether people do their best is enough to influence the entire cause. The sages said, ‘It is up to people to make things happen,’ and ‘Man can conquer nature.’ The railway staff is the largest number of workers, so in other words, among the human conditions, the most important thing is the efforts of the workers. If the workers want to work hard, the first step must be a sound organization, that is, a sound trade union. The Second Representative Assembly of the two railway unions is held today, and its organization is indeed sounder than the first one. With this sound trade union, it is expected that the future of the road will gradually develop and make great strides forward."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Representative of the Party Branch</p>
<p>Li Dasan, Standing Committee member of the Party branches of both lines, gave instructions, stating roughly as follows: "In the past, the trade union of this line was unable to develop its work due to its unsound organization. The special party branch of this line, in view of this, in order to ensure the purity of the members and strictly abide by the organization of the Trade Union Law, ordered the trade union to stop its activities and sent personnel to reorganize it, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. After a long period of efforts by the reorganizers and instructors, the Second Representative Assembly can be held today. The speaker, on behalf of the special party branch of this line, feels very happy to participate in the grand meeting. Our country's production is backward, the rural areas are bankrupt, the society is in depression, and all construction is still undeveloped. In addition, foreign aggression has been frequent over the years. In every way, it is enough to show that the Republic of China has reached an extremely dangerous period. In this period, we can only work together to save the crisis. The two trade unions of our line also bear considerable responsibility. Furthermore, as the railway is an important cause of national construction, the railway workers should take national prosperity as a prerequisite and cannot always seek comfort for themselves. The two railway unions have not seemed to pay attention to this point in the past, so I would like to raise this point in the hope that you will not only pay close attention to it, but also tell all the workers of this line."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Director of the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Bureau, gave instructions, which were solemn and important. They are recorded as follows: "(1) There must be a legitimate organization, and it must be handled in accordance with the legal procedures so that the railway union can exist permanently and seek benefits for all the workers. (2) There must be legitimate work, and everything must be done according to the rules, for the sake of the public, and with consideration for laws and regulations. (3) I hope that the workers will thoroughly understand the relationship between the state-owned railway and the workers. (4) I hope that the workers will thoroughly understand production and construction. (5) I hope that the workers will understand traffic mobilization. (6) I hope that the workers will understand the current economic difficulties of this line. (7) I hope that the trade union will lead all the workers to overcome this difficulty together with the railway bureau. Finally, I would like to encourage all the representatives with three common sayings: 1. The meaning of 'a rising tide lifts all boats.' 2. 'You must feed the sheep well before you can get wool.' 3. 'If you want to eat eggs, you must feed the hen well.' After that, Wang Yalen, representative of the special party branch of the Shanhaiguan Railway Bureau, gave a speech, which is not recorded due to its length.</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Wu Renfu gave a reply, stating roughly as follows: "The trade union of this line is holding its Second Representative Assembly today. We are very honored to have the representatives of the Central Committee, the Ministry of Railways, the special party branch, the Railway Bureau, as well as the reorganizers and instructors present to guide us. We will accept all the instructions from you with 120,000 points of sincerity and do our best. In the past, the organization of the two railway unions was not perfect and the members were too complex, just like farmers sowing seeds that were not pure, so the results were often not satisfactory. Now, with the assistance of the special party branch, the Railway Bureau, and all parties, we have picked out all kinds of impure elements one by one and replanted them, so we can convene the Second Representative Assembly today. In addition to encouraging ourselves to cooperate, on the other hand, we hope that the Central Committee, the Ministry of Railways, the special party branch, the Railway Bureau, and all the guests can continue to give us instructions at any time, as a compass, and please continue to give us assistance at all times, so that the seeds sown today can gradually flourish. It is our sincere hope.” Then, slogans were shouted and a group photo was taken, marking the completion of the ceremony. It is reported that the first meeting will continue at 3:00 PM to pass the charter and elect supervisors and directors.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that Mr. Blanc, the former vice president of the American Eastern Banking Corporation, has been handling the liquidation affairs of the branch established by Mr. Reaven in Manila. Because Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of the American Feng Bank, accused him of being involved in fraud with Mr. Reaven and others, he was detained by the Philippine authorities and handed over to the captain of the President Coolidge, who escorted him to Shanghai. He arrived in port today (the 9th). Because a certain American company had submitted a bond of US$10,000, he was able to disembark freely today. When asked about the accusations, he replied that he did not know the details.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shanghai Branch of Guangdong Bank Ordered by Head Office to Liquidate; Guangdong Associations Telegraph Request for On-Site Liquidation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reported that after the Shanghai branch of Guangdong Bank closed down, it followed the Ministry's order and reported the actual situation of its assets and liabilities to the Banking Association, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. Because the branch's assets and liabilities offset each other and there was a surplus, there was once a widespread rumor that it would resume business. However, the branch received a telegram from its Hong Kong head office at 6:00 PM last night, deciding to liquidate and hiring British lawyer Mr. Halwarth as the liquidator. It is reported that Mr. Ha is scheduled to go to the bank at 9:00 AM this morning to implement the liquidation. After receiving the telegram, the branch manager Zhang Rongpu prepared all the account books and prepared to hand them over to the liquidator today for liquidation. Since the branch's assets and liabilities offset each other and there is a surplus, depositors will not suffer losses after the liquidation. The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, the Guangzhao Office, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation, and other organizations believed that Guangdong merchants had suffered significant losses after the bank closed down. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which was forwarded to the bank's board of directors, hoping that the Shanghai and Hankou branches would liquidate on-site. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To the distinguished gentlemen of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce: According to the creditors, Yangzi Hotel, etc., please forward this to the board of directors of Guangdong Bank. The closure of the Shanghai and Hankou branches has caused great losses to Guangdong overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Finance and the Banking Association have promised to do their best to maintain it. Please withdraw the liquidator immediately and order the Shanghai and Hankou branches to liquidate on-site. The creditors in Shanghai have filed a criminal lawsuit. What do the directors think? Please reply by telegram.</p>

<p>Lu Zuo, a youth named Zhou, 20 years old, from Zhuji, Zhejiang, worked as a biochemical technician at the National Shanghai Medical College at 373 Avenue Haig in the French Concession. He shared a dormitory with Zhou Futian, a fellow villager who worked as a bacteriology technician at the college. On the night of the 6th of this month, Zhou Futian accidentally forgot the key to the bacteriology department's room in the dormitory. Zhou Lu Zuo picked it up and hid it. That night, he secretly opened the door of the bacteriology department and stole a tube of typhoid bacteria, hiding it under the bed in the bedroom. Later, Zhou Futian discovered that the key had been stolen, and after realizing something was wrong, he reported it to the president, Dr. Yan Fuqing (55 years old, from Shanghai). Dr. Yan tried to open the door of the bacteriology department and found that a tube of typhoid bacteria was missing. Dr. Yan considered the lost bacteria to be a major matter. If it were to fall into the hands of outsiders, it would affect public health. He believed that Zhou Lu Zuo was highly suspicious. When he questioned him, he denied it outright. Yan then reported it to the Foch Police Station and requested an investigation. After investigation by detective Wang Ronggui and detective Yao Zhupo, Zhou Lu Zuo was arrested. After confessing the location where the bacteria were hidden, the stolen goods were recovered. Zhou Lu Zuo was taken into custody and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the Police Department explained the case and requested a postponement, waiting for the investigation of the case before filing a lawsuit. The plaintiff, Yan Fuqing, also came to court to explain the theft of the bacteria and requested the withdrawal of the lawsuit. The court said that the police station had not yet filed a lawsuit and needed to wait for the investigation before the lawsuit could be withdrawn. When questioned, the defendant Zhou Lu Zuo admitted to stealing, aiming to study the causes of bacterial growth. The court asked that since he was in the medical college, he could ask to study, so why steal? The defendant was speechless and had no answer. After examination by judge Sun Pengxian, the hearing was rescheduled for the 11th, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Huang Xianyao and Others; The Case of Forging Documents Concluded; —Sentence Scheduled for the 16th— <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the second son of the late Huang Chu Jiu, founder of the Gongfa Company, Riyue Bank, and the Great World, colluded with lawyer Mi Jingshen and clerk Wu Jiajin, who are now working in other places, to defraud his father-in-law Zhou Songqing of money by forging a note of 100,000 yuan from Zhou. He filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court for mediation, but it was unsuccessful. Subsequently, Wang Shaozeng and other creditors of Gongfa Company learned of this and filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing of damaging creditors' rights. After being examined, he opened a safe deposit box at the Guohua Bank and took out the original note. Zhou immediately surrendered it to the French Police Station, accusing Huang Xianyao of forging documents. The self-litigation case on the creditor side was suspended as a result, pending the police station's investigation and indictment. Later, the police station identified the handwriting on the note as forgery and escorted Huang to the Second Special District Court to file a public prosecution. After repeated trials by Judge Li Changnian, the two defendants, Mi and Wu, were not present because they could not be summoned. The trial of Huang Xianyao had already been concluded, and a date was set for sentencing. However, the judge in charge of the case, for the sake of caution, revoked the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a new debate. All the details have been reported in the previous newspaper. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Li of the Second Special District Court presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court and informed the defendant of the reasons for the new debate. After questioning, Huang Xianyao confessed that he had originally hired lawyer Mi Jingshen to handle the cohabitation case with his wife, and they took advantage of the opportunity to forge the note. After the application for mediation failed, he stopped the proceedings. Later, they offered the note to the creditors, resulting in a lawsuit. He was actually deceived and implicated, and the note was not forged by him. He had never threatened or extorted money from his father-in-law and requested that he be acquitted. After the questioning, the court ordered the debate to begin. After the police department lawyer Gu Shouxi and the defendant's defense lawyer debated each other, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 16th.</p>

<p>Huang Jinfu, the owner of the Jianhua Construction Factory at 51 Changping Road, Zhenjiang, had previously deposited 700 yuan in the Mingyao Commercial Savings Bank on Beijing Road. However, the bank announced its closure in May of this year due to the influence of its Qingdao head office. Several months have passed, and there is still no concrete solution for general depositors. The depositors have hired lawyers and filed lawsuits against the bank's responsible persons, Tong Jinhui and Yu Dehua, in the First Special District Court. The trials have been held several times, but have not yet concluded. However, Huang Jinfu had a different idea. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, he wrote a threatening letter and delivered it to the home of Yu Dehua, the deputy manager of the Minghua Bank, at 19 Lane 640 Seymour Road, threatening to kill him if he did not return the deposit, saying that Yu's life would be in danger. After receiving the letter, Yu reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei to investigate. Until 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, Huang Jinfu suddenly wandered and peered at Yu's door, and was seen by two Chinese policemen, numbers 2099 and 2138, who found his behavior suspicious and arrested him. After Detective Zhu questioned him, Huang claimed that he was going to ask for the deposit. After the police compared the handwriting of the note written by Huang with the handwriting of the threatening letter received by Yu, they found that they were mostly similar. He was ordered to be detained and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for the crime of intimidation under Article 305 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Huang Jinfu, hired lawyer Jia Yaoxi to defend him in court. After a brief questioning by Judge Ye, he ordered that he be detained for a retrial in seven days.</p>

<p>The Two-Roads Administration issued a notice yesterday stating that the Longhai Railway had inquired via telegram from various connecting railways whether they would handle kerosene, matches, etc., as freight collect, according to item 4 of section B of Article 2 of the "Responsible Transportation Regulations." After investigation, it was found that item 4 of section B of Article 2 of the "Responsible Transportation Regulations" stipulates that explosives and dangerous goods are not eligible for responsible transportation. However, kerosene, matches, fireworks, film, oilcloth, oiled paper, or their products are not subject to this restriction. Furthermore, Article 16 stipulates that all dangerous goods are not eligible for freight collect. Although kerosene and matches can be transported with responsibility, they are still considered dangerous goods and should not be eligible for freight collect. Therefore, the Administration has responded to the various connecting railways that freight collect will not be accepted. This notice is hereby issued for strict compliance.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Theater's performance of the drama "Modern Lady" at the Jincheng Theater this summer, its reputation soared. Major theaters in other cities vied to invite the troupe to perform, but all were politely declined. The main reason for this was to rush the rehearsal of Mr. Chen Dabei's musical drama "Xi Shi." It is said that Mr. Chen and director Gu Wenzong have rehearsed it to perfection. Once the Wanfang Troupe's engagement is over, it will be performed at the Carlton Theater. After that, it will travel to Beijing, Hangzhou, Pinghan, and other locations, performing both musical drama and spoken drama. The musical drama "Xi Shi" is divided into five acts, with songs and dances interspersed in each act. The songs include eight ancient melodies and folk songs such as "The Song of Guts and Gall," "The Song of Washing Silk," and "Nostalgia." These have been rushed into production as records by the Baidai Company and will be released soon. The dances include "The Dance of the Su Terrace," "The Dance of Washing Silk," and "The Dance of Gan Jiang," all wonderful ancient dances that had almost disappeared. These are the masterpieces of vocal expert Chen Gexin and dance expert Wu Xiaobang, who have exhausted their creative energies. The scenery includes magnificent sets such as "The Chang Le Palace," "The Gu Su Terrace," "The Echoing Corridor," and "The Washing Silk Stream." These were all designed and painted by art expert Hu Xuguang after personally visiting Suzhou and Zhuji to conduct on-site surveys. Shanghai residents will soon be able to enjoy a feast for the eyes and ears.</p>

Recently, a verified quit smoking prescription from Master Yinguang has been proven effective on many. There is also a guide to fundamentally treating seminal emission, which, after reading, can enable those suffering from seminal emission to receive fundamental treatment and avoid blindly investing in ineffective Chinese and Western medicines, wasting money.

<p>— (White-Necked Crow)</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Nothing in the world is more level than water." But water flows downward and only levels in a level place, showing that "levelness" is not water's inherent nature. It is also said, "Nothing in the world is more impartial than a mirror." But a mirror makes the beautiful more beautiful and the ugly uglier. People differ in beauty and ugliness, inherently an unfair creation. A mirror only knows to "reflect things as they are," unable to adjust in the slightest, correct the unfairness of creation, and make up for human defects. How can it be considered impartial? Therefore, there is simply no "fair" thing in the world.</p>
<p>When you are short of funds, you ask someone to lend you money, and they are very generous: "Hey! Feel free to borrow a few thousand or a few hundred yuan. Don't hesitate." And they readily agree. But when you are broke and want to borrow a dollar to pay the rent, you have to hem and haw and still can't get it out. If you manage to say it, you might get a cold laugh in return. It's not that people's attitudes are different; it's that your own position is different first. So the saying goes, "If you want to borrow eggs from someone, you must first raise a fat hen." This is also a very insightful life philosophy.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Female Teachers <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>I often think that if all the primary schools in the country used female teachers and became "mother schools," children's academic performance would definitely be more impressive than it is now. It's not that I'm infatuated with female teachers and dismiss male teachers altogether, but the facts proven by surveys and experience are enough to support my claim.</p>
<p>Children are the most adorable little angels, innocent and carefree. Women are calm, and men are lively. If given proper education, there is no reason why they can't succeed. The problem is that the teachers themselves are not yet successful, with shallow knowledge and bad behavior, and they spoil the good children they teach. Therefore, current teaching should not be about discussing doctrines and theories or coming up with new tricks but about strict certification of teachers. Then we parents can naturally rest assured about our children's education.</p>
<p>A dozen years ago, many female teachers were women who had problems in their marriages. Some had husbands who had affairs, causing rifts in their love; others were young widows who spent their time as primary school teachers to pass the years. Their situations were very pitiable. When I was a teacher at the XX Girls' School in N City, there was a Ms. B among my colleagues. She was gentle and effective in teaching, and the students were as affectionate to her as little birds. She had a daughter and a son whom she brought with her to study. They were intelligent, beautiful, and very lovable. A few days before the summer vacation of the following year, all the students suddenly learned that the principal had dismissed her and launched a farewell party as a memento. I sat in the audience and saw Ms. B take the stage. She first said a few humble words of encouragement and finally said, "Dear little brothers and sisters, thank you very much for holding a farewell party for me today. I hope that in the future, you will give me something that you may not refuse, right?" I was very surprised that she herself was asking the students for gifts. Unexpectedly, she continued, "Perhaps my dear little brothers and sisters would be willing to give me a few funeral couplets!" As she spoke, her eyes turned red. At this time, many students in the audience began to sob, and I felt a pang of sadness and ran outside.</p>
<p>It turned out that Ms. B's husband, although a scholar, was of bad character and willingly degraded himself. He had fallen into a state of depravity and was wandering outside all year round, and no one knew where he was. Ms. B was introduced by _ Jun to teach at the XX Girls' School in N City. The condition was that in addition to a monthly salary of twenty yuan, she would be exempt from tuition and board fees for her two children. Later, because the school's finances were strained, they had to dismiss her and hire a Ms. C, which saved the cost of feeding two children. But Ms. B's life became problematic because of this!</p>
<h3 id="e132">High Counter <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between pawnshops and ordinary stores is the counter, which is at least twice as high as that of ordinary stores. _ is hidden high up, holding up a water pipe, with an utterly upright pawnbroker's face, overlooking everything outside the counter, making the anxious pawner standing outside the high counter seem three feet shorter.</p>
<p>Speaking of the high counter in pawnshops, it is incredibly imposing. I remember when I was little, I went to pawn something under strict orders. The counter was high, and I was short. I had to stand on my tiptoes, holding my breath, just to get the clothes package onto the counter. The pawnbroker glanced at the clothes package as if he didn't care, and coldly said, "Five yuan." But I was under strict orders to pawn it for eight yuan. The pawnbroker said with a stern face, "At most six yuan." As he spoke, he pushed the clothes package to the edge of the counter. But I stood on my tiptoes and couldn't reach it. So the pawnbroker pushed the clothes package casually, and it fell to the ground, scattering the clothes. On that occasion, I had an impression of this high counter that I would never forget.</p>
<p>But this arrogant high counter is said to be on the path to misfortune now. Every high counter only spits out white silver dollars, swallowing goods that are fully pawned but cannot be redeemed. Therefore, the pawnshop owners are at a loss. The pawnbrokers are also not as leisurely and carefree as before, holding up their water pipes all day long. The high counter, in form, is still squatting high, but its power is no longer what it used to be.</p>
<p>This year, Shanghai has seen many pawnshops close down due to the pressure of economic recession. In the interior, due to the collapse of the countryside, pawnshops are also closing down one after another. The few that remain are just eking out an existence. The golden age of the high counter has passed, and now it has reached the end of its rope. I am afraid that in the near future, the so-called "high counter" will become a historical term.</p>

<p>As Ma San walked out, two attendants were already blocking the door, slapping him on the left and punching him on the right, knocking him back into the room. The two attendants followed closely behind, also entering the room. With stiff faces and upright torsos, they stood behind Ma San. Ma San thought that he had given Mrs. Lan a jab in the dark and that he could just turn around and leave. He didn't expect to be beaten back before he could leave the door. Turning back to see the two attendants, who were fierce and standing close, he had no choice but to stand still with his hands down. Commissioner Lan also sat up straight and said, "This thing is very hateful. We are talking to you here, why do you ignore us and turn around to leave?" Ma San had to lower his voice and said, "I thought there was nothing more to say, so I left. Because I only take care of the things downstairs." Commissioner Lan said, "I just want you to take care of the things downstairs. Listen, that crying woman is still sobbing. Go tell him that this Little Western Paradise is not rented by him alone. Tell him to be considerate of public morality and not to cry anymore. If he cries again, I will call the police." Ma San repeatedly agreed twice, but he didn't dare to move. Mrs. Lan said, "Go downstairs and tell him. If he cries again, I'll deal with you too. Get out!" Ma San slowly retreated out of the room, went down the stairs in a puff of smoke, and heard Yueying crying even harder in the room. He was about to open his mouth to speak inside, but he saw the door open, so he had to pause. At the same time, he heard Jia Duocai sigh and say, "Why don't you believe what I say? If I didn't think of you just coming to my side and using my temper, you wouldn't be able to stand it." He also heard Yueying say with sobs, "Think about it! My flesh and blood are telling me that my mother is sick, and you won't let me go back to see her. How can I not be sad?" (311)</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The eunuch tottered to hand a teaspoon of pearl powder to the Empress Dowager. As soon as the Empress Dowager took it, she stretched out her tongue and poured the powder into her mouth. At that time, we who were standing beside her had already prepared a cup of warm tea. As soon as she poured the pearl powder into her mouth, we hurriedly sent the tea over. She didn't take the teacup but drank a few sips from our hands, hurriedly swallowing the pearl powder.</p>
<p>"The amount of pearl powder is very important!" Once, she told me about the effects of taking pearl powder. "If you take a little bit, it can help us retain our youth. Its effect is purely revealed on the skin, which can make a person's skin always very smooth and radiant. Old people can be the same as young people. But the amount taken must be very small, and there must be a considerable amount of time between each time. If you eat too much or do not have a fixed time and eat it every few days, then it is not only useless to the human body but also greatly harmful!</p>
<p>Although she said that, I dare not say how sure I am that pearl powder has the effect of preserving beauty before we have experimented with it. Even if the Empress Dowager's appearance can be maintained to be more tender than ordinary old people, I cannot actually prove whether it is the result of regularly taking pearl powder. I only know that until I left the palace, the Empress Dowager's habit of taking pearl powder was never interrupted, and she always seemed to take this matter very seriously. (411)</p>
<h3 id="e135">A Little Fear of One's Wife Leads to Abundance <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>"A little fear of one's wife leads to abundance." This saying is quite believable.</p>
<p>Dr. Mou's reputation has grown day by day since returning from abroad, and his career has unknowingly become more and more prosperous. His door is crowded during the day, and he has to go out for house calls in the afternoon. He is really a bit too busy. His family was not very wealthy, but since he hung up his shingle, in less than a few years, a Western-style house has been built in the city center. This is all thanks to his wife.</p>
<p>She is an old-fashioned woman, and he and she are not very compatible. However, the family's economic power is completely in her hands. He doesn't even know how much he owns, and his name is not on any bank savings accounts.</p>
<p>She is very meticulous and likes to be generous with small favors. Therefore, she knows exactly how many patients he sees each day, how many house calls he makes, and how much he charges for injections, down to the last penny. Sometimes, when she is happy, she gives him one or two yuan to spend, but he still has to report everything in detail, and only after it is approved can he get the money.</p>
<p>She is naturally very frugal in managing the family. Although she likes to play mahjong, she likes to think of it as a pastime and doesn't care about winning or losing. In the summer, when she gets happy playing mahjong, she delegates the bathing of the children to him. Sometimes, she finds the children troublesome, so she takes out a few dimes from the mahjong table and tells him to take the children to see a movie. Although he is not very willing to do these things when he is tired after bathing, he has no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>She often tells people, "Each of the three sons will build a Western-style house for him in the future." Dr. Mou feels a little unwilling to be a workhorse at first, but when he thinks of "a little fear of one's wife leads to abundance," he calms down.</p>

<h3 id="e136">That So-Called Accomplished One <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow-Sun</p>
<p>A relative of mine, surnamed Mou, thanks to his father and grandfather's legacy, had a comfortable family life. He graduated from university and possessed some talent. During his school years, he would always flirt with girls, the so-called "loving widely but devoted to none." People excused him, assuming he wasn't mindful of the caution against being unrestrained in one's youthful ardor. After marrying, he didn't mind the stale formalities of the wedding ceremony, but he treated his bride quite fondly, and they had children. However, an extramarital affair gradually became known at home. Before long, he was bewitched by his mistress and promptly falsely accused his wife, abandoning her and their children. A new woman entered his house, also with children of her own. Then, he had another fling, quickly left her, and went to his new favorite. Now, Mou is approaching fifty. It's estimated that the number of extramarital affairs he's had is countless, and the offspring he's left in the world are truly numerous. Just recently, I heard that he has a new paramour. Alas, how prolific!</p>
<p>When Mou abandons his wife and children, even if his original wife is deeply attached and yearns for him, wanting to turn into a stone waiting for her husband, or others are left wandering on the crossroads, ultimately becoming flowers fallen into the latrine, he willingly plays the heartless Wang Kui, never once feeling a pang of pity or shame. As for those who wish to remain with him for a long time, he regards them like a widow who keeps to herself in memory of her deceased husband. I once happened to spend a night with a woman who lingered in a humble inn amidst the crowing of roosters, and she hastily departed before dawn under the waning moon, ensuring that her lovely eyebrows wouldn't be waiting for him. Or, if someone else plans to stay with him, he regards it as Luo Fu having her own husband after all. I once happened to secretly cross Chencang, enjoying the romance, so don't blame her for not marrying for ten years.</p>
<p>As for the children he had with their mothers and then left, he doesn't care about their food, clothing, education, or upbringing. Some can barely manage to stay with their mothers, while others are overwhelmed and the mothers and children are separated. He leaves them to drift like duckweed, struggling in the flow of fate, ultimately becoming heroes or villains, thieves or prisoners, or starving corpses and withered bones, just like the people of Qin viewing the thin or fat of the Yue people, remaining indifferent and unmoved! The ancients said, "Care for the young of your own, and extend that care to the young of others." What he practices can be twisted to mean, "This 'young' is mine, I care for my own and abandon the 'young' of others!" Thus, people know that he adheres to the principle of not recognizing goods after leaving the store.</p>
<p>Mou is certainly an intellectual. He chases after the delights of the world of beauty, neglecting his life, developing chronic illnesses, losing his wealth, and abandoning his career, to the point where people hardly acknowledge him. Yet, he eloquently justifies himself with philosophical and enlightened views: "Alas! People of the world toil their entire lives, exhausting their energy and spirits without hesitation. What are they after? Are they not merely seeking the joy of wives and children, and the desire to expand their family's fame? I can easily obtain what even immortals find difficult and sages cannot achieve. Wealth and status are like fleeting clouds to me. Am I not happily content, enjoying supreme bliss? Moreover, a person's life should be about enjoying oneself! My life is limited. If I don't seize the moment, forget myself and my ego, and use it to please myself, but instead fret and worry, only indulging in desires of love, anger, and lust, I'm wasting this short life. It's all in vain! If you are content with it, then so be it! Alas! This is the source of all suffering for living beings. How pitiful is that!"</p>
<p>Listening to his words, he seems to have reached a decisive conclusion. However, everyone, including his own father, considers him a disreputable man. His virtuous wives, guarding their chastity, also guard their children, and ultimately suffer because of him. Is he then a delusional man? Strange! Can that so-called accomplished one possibly be someone who only cares about their own well-being? Or will they spend their life in romantic abandon without regret? I will record this and observe!</p>

<h3 id="e137">Sichuan Delegation Finalized for National Games: 60 Male and 14 Female Athletes to Depart Sichuan Before the 20th of This Month to Participate in Ten Events Including Track and Field (Men and Women) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(Chengdu Dispatch) Sichuan's sports have had special achievements in the past. For example, the promotion of military sports was second to none nationwide. However, because the leaders failed to deeply understand the relationship between sports and the nation and its people, they went astray, which is regrettable. In recent years, due to the banditry of the Red Army in Sichuan, the military was busy suppressing the communists, the political situation was unstable, and the people were restless. This sports issue gradually stagnated. Since the establishment of the provincial government this year and the entry of the Central Army into Sichuan, all issues are progressing day by day, and a new Sichuan is being built. After Mr. Yang Quanyu took charge of education, he showed great enthusiasm for promoting sports. Originally, a sports supervisor should have been appointed, but because there were already eight supervisors, due to the circumstances in the province, a letter was sent inviting (after arriving in the province, the provincial government appointed) sports expert Mr. Liu Shenzhan to serve as a compilation and review committee member of the Department of Education, effectively bearing the responsibility of sports supervisor. Mr. Liu originally donated funds to establish the Southwest Sports College in Sichuan, spending ten thousand on his family. Later, he took the lead in promoting military sports in the Twentieth Army, serving as the director of the sports department. In 1931, Mr. Liu left Sichuan for Beijing, where the National Sports Conference was held in 1932. Mr. Liu sent an urgent express telegram beforehand to appeal, which was quite insightful. Later, he was hired by the Ministry of Education as an expert member, and his proposals were very important. After the conference closed, Mr. Liu worked for the Xinmin Daily and China Daily in Nanjing, and co-edited the martial arts, sports, and military supplement with Mr. Cheng Dengke in China Daily, promoting new sports. Mr. Liu took over from Mr. Yang and left Beijing for Sichuan in June, arriving in the province on July 16th. Because the provincial government was being relocated at the time, it was extremely difficult to handle affairs.</p>
<p>Preliminary Selection Process</p>
<p>After the Department of Education received the notice from the Sixth National Games Organizing Committee, it immediately issued an order to hold a provincial preliminary selection on August 3rd, and ordered each county and city to prepare to participate. Mr. Liu was ordered to prepare for the provincial preliminary selection on July 20th. The first preparatory meeting was held on the 24th, with only ten days to prepare. After continuous and extremely hard preparations, the meeting was able to open as scheduled, and the conference proceeded extremely smoothly, which was unprecedented in Sichuan province's sports meets. A total of 39 units participated, with more than 370 male and female athletes. The closing ceremony was held on the 9th. The results were very ordinary, but the spirit was excellent. On the 2nd, the second plenary meeting of the preparatory committee was held. Chairman Liu reported on the progress of the conference, the various results, and discussed various important cases before announcing the end. Regarding the location for training the athletes, the Huaxi University Huamei Dormitory and Yude College in the south of the city were contacted in advance as dormitories for male and female athletes, and the Huaxi University sports field was used as a training ground for the athletes. The proposed events to participate in include men's track and field, all-around, soccer, basketball, tennis, martial arts, and women's track and field, basketball, and tennis, ten events in total. The results of men's and women's volleyball were also good, but due to limited funds, despite the volleyball team's several requests, it was ultimately not approved. The training period was one month, from August 19th to September 8th. In terms of curriculum, they get up at dawn for morning exercises. There are lectures from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m., a spiritual talk for one hour in the afternoon, and two hours of exercise training. There are also games after dinner. The training staff includes training director Liu Shenzhan, managers Xiang Zhijun (male) and Zhu Wenfang (female), and secretaries Huang Xixia, Zuo Jingxiu, and Yu Shenchang. Deng Deguang is the soccer coach, Yang Jiayin is the basketball coach, Cai Yiping is the field events coach, and Long Zecheng is the track events coach. Sixty male athletes and fourteen female athletes are being trained.</p>
<p>Overall Delegation</p>
<p>After the Sichuan athletes for the Sixth National Games were selected through the provincial preliminary selection, they gathered at Huaxi University in the southern suburbs of the city on August 18th for collective training. The male athletes lived in the Huamei Dormitory, and the female athletes lived in the Yude Dormitory, which were very close to each other. Every day, under the enthusiastic guidance of the coaches and the athletes' hard work, their results have improved. The management is completely militarized. Although the Huada sports field is not very suitable, the school is large, the air is fresh, and the scenery is beautiful. It is indeed the best among the available options and is suitable for athletes to live in. Every morning from 5:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. and every afternoon from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. are the times for track and field and various ball sports training.

<p>Liu Shenzhan's Remarks</p>
<p>According to what Director Liu Shenzhan told reporters, the purpose of promoting sports is not to go to the sports meet, and the purpose of going to the sports meet is not to win the championship. This is not because Sichuan's results are ordinary, so I make this argument. Therefore, during the training period, I focused on the spiritual aspect and had great expectations for the male and female athletes.</p>
<p>I want to lay the foundation for being a person and a warrior for the restoration and the nation in this short period of time. Although the goal is like this, the habits of the athletes are too ingrained, and I have not seen that a satisfactory result can be achieved immediately. As for my return to Sichuan this time, knowing that the responsibility is great, the difficulties are many, and the obstacles are numerous, I still strive forward, which is really a matter of responsibility. I have always been determined to disregard sacrifice and disregard success or failure, and only know how to work hard. Although there are more than forty sports colleagues and there are factions, there is really no faction. Because the colleagues are so scattered that they cannot form a faction, there is really no group of more than three people, and their wills are extremely incompatible. In such a situation, it is difficult to cooperate. This time, my personal return to Sichuan is to fully prepare for the provincial preliminary selection. All colleagues serve as staff members of the conference. After several conversations with me, they can understand the position that the country and the nation need, and the position that sports can make. The spirit of cooperation shown in the conference is highly praised by the community. This cannot but be said to be a turning point for Sichuan's sports. Finally, Director Liu said that because the Sichuan team is too far away, they will probably start their journey east on September 20th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai inter-port players who attended the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-port swimming competition tested their scores at Xiqingchi on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 6 p.m. They were strictly timed by the local amateur swimming association and used as an official record. The original representative for the 440-yard event was Hai Meng. Because Hai Ye participated in too many events, the amateur association plans to select one person from Shi Bogen and Wanlielai to replace Hai Meng. The trial was also held yesterday, but the results were still slightly better, and the test will be repeated at 6 pm today. Only yesterday was 500 yards. When Shi Yu reached 440 yards, he did arrive one foot earlier than Ge Lie. His 900-yard result was also 15 seconds. Jian Erjie and Huo Gen also officially practiced the 100-yard prone swimming yesterday, the result was 8 seconds, and Huo Gen was 83 seconds. There is also a 100-yard relay. The four people in Group A created Shanghai's highest record with 1 minute and 40 seconds, which is more than 4 seconds better than the old record of 1 minute and 46 seconds. The result of Group B was 1 minute and 47 seconds. It is commendable that Liang Weisheng of China participated in the first part of Group B. Buleidun of Group A started one yard. But it can be said that it is difficult to reach the end point half an arm earlier. At 6 pm today, the results were tested at Xiqing, and the results have been determined to be the Chong of Shi Bogen to Ge Lie, and Jian Er to the prone swimming of Erzi. At that time, there will be a fierce fight. The new record created in yesterday's 200-yard relay has been officially recognized by the Amateur Sports Association. The results are recorded below.</p>
<p>100 yards Jian Erjie eighty-one seconds Huo Gen eighty-three seconds one hundred and fifty yards Shi Bogen six minutes fifteen million Lie Lai one point ten seconds two five seconds two six</p>

<p>Old Qiu is old and weak; he is not what he used to be. The Chen Fu Zhang vs. Ters match was not held yesterday.</p>
<p>In the senior singles tournament of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, the match between Wang Wenzheng and Qiu Feihai, which was postponed due to rain in the previous few days, was finally held at Kangti Road at 4 PM yesterday. As a result, Wang Wenzheng won two sets to one. The match between Chen Chuanzhang and She Tes was not held. Here is a brief account of the situation:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng wins two consecutive games</p>
<p>Upon entering the court, Wenzheng immediately took the offensive, hitting left and right. He was seen running all over the court, while the veteran Feihai was unable to resist his momentum. Although he had beautiful corner shots, they were ineffective. Wenzheng saw through his intentions and was able to cope with them one by one, returning his fierce shots in the midst of his busy schedule. Old Qiu was helpless and lost two consecutive games.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai responds calmly</p>
<p>Feihai, facing the enemy's consecutive wins, became angry and displayed his power. The balls were like linked pearls, killing Wenzheng, who was at a loss. Although he tried to cope from all sides, it was difficult to return the shots. In this game, Wenzheng lost.</p>
<p>3 to 1, the game is set</p>
<p>Feihai was eager for revenge, but his killing momentum did not last long. He was often unable to get his way. Wenzheng saw the opportunity and returned to his old ways, launching a major offensive, opening the game from left and right, killing Feihai, who could only parry and had no ability to fight back. After a long time, Old Qiu ran back and forth, exhausted, and had to surrender again with a score of six to one. The competition ended at almost 6 PM. The results are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e157">Ministry of Education Orders Attention to the Qualifications of Vocational School Principals <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Telegraph) The Ministry of Education orders all departments and bureaus that whether or not the principal of a vocational school is a suitable person is deeply related to the progress of vocational education. The Ministry has revised the vocational school regulations, and the qualifications of principals of junior and senior vocational schools have been clearly stipulated. In particular, it is important to note that the current school and the subject being studied must be of the same nature and have expertise. Principals should not only be responsible for administration but also pay close attention to teaching practice and school improvement. According to the statistics of vocational schools across the country in the past year, only 45% of the qualifications of vocational school principals in various provinces and cities are of the same nature as the school subjects they are teaching, and 55% are of different natures. This kind of undesirable phenomenon is a major reason why most vocational schools cannot develop healthily. In addition, the qualifications of principals of private vocational schools in various provinces are mostly non-compliant, and many only have administrative experience but no educational experience. Furthermore, most of the vocational courses attached to middle schools in many provinces and cities have not been set up as separate schools in accordance with the regulations, which is even more inconsistent with the regulations. It is hereby ordered that the department comply with the requirements to improve each. For current principals of public and private vocational schools who do not meet the qualifications, they should be gradually replaced. For the selection of principals of public schools in the future, the process must be handled carefully, and private schools should be strictly supervised and guided so that all public and private vocational school principals are qualified. The vocational courses attached to each middle school should be set up as separate schools in order to comply with the regulations and promote vocational education. The implementation plan should be reported to the Ministry for record.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 9th) Based on the industrial categories and vocational school subject investigation forms filled out by various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education believes that the industrial categories in various provinces and cities and the existing vocational subjects are not closely related.

<h3 id="e161">Nanyang English Leadership Government Holds Joint Examination for Overseas Chinese Schools; Held in Seven Locations Including Singapore and Malacca; The Reason is to Check the Level of Students in Each School <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>At the end of last year, it was once rumored that the local government of Nanyang English Leadership would hold a joint examination for overseas Chinese schools. Fortunately, it gradually subsided. However, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation recently received a report from the Singapore Overseas Chinese Newspaper stating that the examination has been revived and will be held at the end of this year. The reason given is to check whether the level of students in each Chinese school is consistent and to provide students in each overseas Chinese school with an opportunity to observe each other. The reporter of Shenshi News Agency has recorded the details as follows: (1) The date of the examination is in early November, about ten days before the Chinese school examination. Although this date is not fixed, it is relatively reliable. (2) The examination locations will be in Singapore, Malacca, Seremban, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, and other places, held simultaneously. (3) Examination methods: Chinese language, Chinese literature, arithmetic, history, and geography, with 50 points as the passing grade for each subject. Those who pass three subjects are considered qualified. All students in the junior high school, senior elementary school, and junior graduating classes of each school are required to participate in the examination. (4) Examination level: The standard used for the level is not limited to textbooks but is based on the curriculum standards promulgated by the Chinese government's Ministry of Education, and is adopted with consideration of local conditions. (5) All schools subsidized by the local government will be ordered to participate. However, in special circumstances, or if the distance from the examination location is too far to comply, they may request permission to be exempted from the relevant authorities. 2. Schools that are not subsidized by the government will be invited to participate, but attendance is not forced. (6) Purpose of the examination: 1. To check whether the level of students in each Chinese school is consistent. 2. To provide students in each Chinese school with an opportunity to observe each other. (7) Examination certificates: The Ministry of Education will issue certificates to students who pass the examination for use as proof of employment or transfer after leaving school. (8) Examination questions: The examination questions will be formulated and issued by the Ministry of Education. (9) Grading of examination papers: Examination papers will not be graded by outsiders, but will be undertaken by personnel from the Ministry of Education. (10) Announcement of results: The list of results will be announced before the start of school next spring. At that time, the number of students enrolled in each school, the number of students taking the examination, and the number of students passing will be announced at the same time to show the good results of each school for reference. (11) Not a graduation examination: Because the purpose of this examination is completely based on the sixth and tenth articles, each school must still conduct its own graduation examination. (12) No examination of elective subjects: The reason for not examining this subject is that the course allocations in Chinese schools in each continent are not consistent. Some lack physics, some lack chemistry, and sometimes both are missing, making it extremely difficult to formulate questions. Reiterate the previous order and notify all city schools to comply.</p>

<p>– Originally written by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"I'm going for a walk; do you want to come?" Ned asked, trying to act nonchalant, but also very grateful for her silent sympathy, as he thought everyone would despise him as a bad egg.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" Little May ran to get her hat, feeling quite fortunate to be accompanied by an older boy today.</p>
<p>Others also saw them walking away, but no one followed them, which shows that boys are both dull and crude, and they seemed to instinctively feel that in times of difficulty, the kind and loving Little May was their most suitable friend.</p>
<p>"This walk was beneficial to Ned. When he returned, he was quieter than usual and looked happy again, wearing a garland of chrysanthemums, which his little companion had woven for him while he was lying on the grass telling her stories.</p>
<p>No one talked about the unfortunate event of that morning, but its impact may have been all the more lasting. Ned tried his best to improve, and he also received much help, not only in his earnest prayers to God but also in the patient care of that good friend in the world. His kind hand, whenever Ned touched it, never failed to remind him that this was someone who had been willing to endure pain for his sake.</p>

<p>Pre-Festival Foreign Market Remained Dull as Before</p>
<p>In recent days, the silver market has remained the same, with little change. The rise and fall of the market entirely depend on the needs of society. Currently, firms remain committed to a contractionary approach, unlikely to release funds liberally. Therefore, despite the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, the market remains dull. The market interbank loan rate has remained unchanged for many days, still listed at one jiao five fen in the morning and afternoon. This is the reason. Markups and additions are due to strict lending conditions, thus excessive markups ultimately amount to nothing. The morning market clearing for promissory notes totaled 180,000,000, with new transactions over 400,000. Afternoon market transactions [blank] over 10,000. Small clearing house transactions totaled over 600,000. Foreign pledges totaled over [blank] 10,000, with new transactions over [blank] 10,000. Over 500,000 banknotes were recovered, with over 10,000 circulating notes issued and over 10,000 marked notes [blank]. Inbound remittances from various routes totaled over 400,000, with inbound funds at 100,000 and outbound funds at 110,000.

Chinese banks cleared over 1,100,000 in promissory notes, cleared over 2,200,000 in various goods collateral and miscellaneous funds, over 500,000 in special remittances, over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese banks cleared over 1,200,000 in promissory notes, cleared over 1,800,000 in various goods collateral and miscellaneous funds, over 700,000 in special remittances, over 400,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 300,000 in warehouse exits. Money shops cleared over 49,000,000 in foreign public orders, cleared over 230,000 in foreign markups, and cleared over 20,000 in cash. Yesterday, Jiangnan small dollars, with no transactions in either the morning or afternoon market, resulted in no change in market prices, still listed at 833 yuan. Guangdong small dollars fell 8 jiao in the morning market to 746.7 yuan. The afternoon market continued to fall by one jiao, changing to 746 yuan. Therefore, the result was 1.5 yuan lower than before, with transactions totaling 245,000 jiao in the morning market and 110,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rebounded 1,500 wen to 329,500 wen, with transaction amounts [blank] 18,889.97 strings and 500 wen, equivalent to 8,500 yuan in foreign currency.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, despite the Sunday holiday and the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, the market did not fluctuate as a result. It remained in a holding pattern, becoming increasingly dull. Trading throughout the day was exceptionally quiet. The current month's offering was not traded at all throughout the day. During the morning session, no one inquired about the 369 bonds. This holding pattern has persisted for many days. Firms are listless, with both long and short positions sitting on the sidelines. However, the number of open positions remains considerable. A slight stimulus in the future could lead to significant fluctuations. Change is likely not far off. Yesterday's trading was unremarkable. [Blank] There must have been several types in the session that were not [blank] traded. The most traded one or two types did not [blank] four market prices. Both buyers and sellers had the option to trade or not, so buyers were unwilling to raise prices, and [blank] sellers were also unwilling to reduce prices. The overall [blank] trend was relatively strong, with deferred [blank] disbandment bonds rising [blank] [blank] jiao being the most. The remainder mostly improved by around 0.2 jiao, with two or three types slightly lower by 0.05. The total transaction amount was only 3,155,000 yuan. The exchange announced that the 12th is the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market will be closed for one day.

<p>The yarn market is calm, with a slightly active trend. Spot yarn sales remain brisk. Spot yarn supply is becoming increasingly tight. Demand from Yunnan and Guangdong is particularly strong, raising selling prices by one yuan. This month's futures yarn is uniquely strong, with a squeeze on short positions. It is said that although a certain bank has 54,000 bales for delivery, speculators are preparing to buy as the factory will not easily resume operations, and there will be no goods for delivery in the future.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster covered short positions for futures yarn. At the opening of the pre-market, all months showed signs of weakness. Due to good weather, the cotton market favored short positions, and confidence was weak. At the opening, all months fell by 0.4-0.5 jiao. By the second and third sessions, they gradually rose. It was heard that spot yarn sales were brisk, and firms from Yunnan and Guangdong were excited to purchase. Selling prices for Japanese yarn also rose by 0.5-1 yuan. Thus, short positions were covered. By the close, prices suddenly rose. However, there were relatively few transactions in the market. As a result, all months rose by 0.3, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 jiao compared to the 10th's closing price. The market situation turned favorable after the new year. The [blank] market slightly [blank] due to Changfeng delivering and selling off. Osaka Sanpin yarn also fell by more than one yuan.

<p>Wuhu 60 Anqing 5 Same Industry 105 Tianjin 125</p>
<p>Xiamen 35 Shantou 25 Hankou 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening. The situation is weak because of the White Dew solar term. The weather is clear, and the cotton fields are undamaged. [Blank] winds are not attacking Shanghai. Therefore, confidence is lax. Ningbo firms are also selling off in large quantities, amounting to over 10,000 dan, loosening the market.</p>
<p>Zhengjin firms' confidence is weak. At the opening of the pre-market for bid cotton, the recent weather was sunny and the White Dew solar term showed no changes. Cotton benefited greatly.

<p>Yesterday in the wheat market, after the opening in the morning, due to the reported increase in imported wheat prices by about one yuan, most people in the market were optimistic. Moreover, because the spot wheat factory prices were high, the futures wheat market also showed signs of prosperity. However, major buyers were still waiting and watching, and sellers were adopting pre-holiday strategies, so the market price did not easily rise step by step. However, with few sellers, the market price gradually recovered. December contracts were up 4/8, this month's contracts up 4/8, and other months up 2/8. Spot wheat was expected to be good due to scarcity. Yesterday, after the wheat price increase was reported, holders' sentiment was particularly good, and factory interest also slightly increased, leading to an immediate price increase of 3 to 4 fen. Special grades were not offered. Imported wheat from Bengbu and other kilns were offered at 3.66-3.67 yuan. Fuhsin, Fufeng, Xinda, and Shenda purchased over 60 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday's local rice (South Shanghai) had over twenty suppliers (totaling over 4,000 piculs). Due to the hot, sunny weather and the approaching festival, the local market saw little activity.

The total market offered over 800 bags of Changzhou bull beans, priced from 3.56 to 3.48 yuan; over 310 bags of Jiujiang Chenmen beans, priced from 3.57 to 3.54 yuan; and 27 bags of Ganjiang Bridge beans, priced at 3.65 yuan. Because of the scarcity and aroma of these beans, the price was firm.</p>

<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Here are my seventy-odd essays.</p>
<p>I began to think about writing in the spring of 1933. At that time, I had just suffered the loss of my father and was struggling under the burden of life. Grieving, exhausted, and lonely, I often wanted to find a way to vent. Because I was living alone, I had few people to chat with, so I would flip through the Shen Bao and read the "Free Talk" section.</p>
<p>That's how I got the idea of submitting articles.</p>
<p>But I didn't start writing right away. It wasn't until the end of May that I was urged to repay part of the debt my father had left me. Letters kept coming from home, telling me about the coldness of relatives, the alienation of my father's friends, and the bullying of villagers since my father's death. Then my mother went blind in her right eye. A myriad of arrows pierced my young heart. I couldn't escape. I stayed in my lodgings, listening to the incessant rain, feeling extremely desolate and angry.</p>
<p>But I could still only read "Free Talk."</p>
<p>The rain continued to fall, and I grew more and more grieved and angry. The only way to comfort myself seemed to be to think about the past and then write it down on paper and send it to "Free Talk." A few days later, it was actually published. This was my first article, which is also included in this collection, "Rain in My Hometown."</p>
<p>And so I became a contributor to "Free Talk."</p>
<p>But I didn't bring my own grief and anger to the page. At first, what I wrote was mostly about reminiscing, idle chats, and records of events. Sometimes I would also touch on literary circles or current affairs, and my tone was straightforward. I didn't know anything about taboos, and it was all very childish.</p>
<p>Later, I also submitted articles to other publications. The articles here were mostly published in "Free Talk," "Torch," "Tai Bai," "New Yu Lin," "Human World," "Reading Life," "Trends," "Yu Lin," and other places. But it's not all of them. Many have been lost, and some have been deliberately deleted.</p>
<p>I write very slowly, often revising again and again. If I were to put it nicely, it would be that I'm very careful. But sometimes, being too careful causes problems, and I've even caused some misunderstandings as a result. But misunderstandings are just that. They don't have much of an impact on me.</p>
<p>Just like my background, I'm still a rough guy, and one with a bit of youthful spirit at that.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have often seen middle-aged and older people playing strange tricks. Humor has long been established, and collections of jokes have already been published. They play with antiques, drink good tea, write frivolous poems, read Zhuangzi, recommend the Wen Xuan, and write seal script couplets. Those who are less capable even promote the reading of classics and the revival of classical Chinese. This is called being tired of living. But it's the young people who suffer. Because they themselves are tired of living, they try to persuade young people to learn to be mature and pretend to be leisurely. Even children around ten years old are not spared. How many pure and useful minds in elementary school are being ruined into fossils by reading classics!</p>
<p>In these situations, I am willing to open my throat and oppose it with all my might. It's not because I'm still young and the issue is particularly relevant to me. It's really because in the last two years, the path left for young people to take has been too difficult. Big and small responsibilities are always placed on the shoulders of young people! But when they really take them up, this one says "not right," that one says "not so," and some even say "not allowed." Loving freshness requires telling lies, and being unemployed is a sign of high standards and weak abilities. Think about it, my teachers, where is the road?</p>
<p>But there is a road, and it must be forged by young people themselves.</p>
<p>My articles sometimes appear in the seats of gentlemen—in publications that promote leisure. But I only sell my articles, not myself, so many of my opinions are still rough. But in the world, there is only one self. Gentlemen are allowed to have a self, but rough guys are not, and their fate is to be deleted.</p>
<p>This makes me afraid to go to the gentlemen's seats again.</p>
<p>The essays I have collected in this book are up to the end of March of this year.</p>
<p>Looking at it, it's the plum rain season again. My mood is still the same as it was two years ago—grief, exhaustion, and loneliness. But this time, I'm not shrinking back so much.</p>
<p>Calling this book "Collected Essays of Tui Bei" doesn't have any deep meaning, and it's not to say that my articles will predict anything. According to legend, when Li Chunfeng and Yuan Tiangang were making the Tui Bei Tu, Yuan pushed Li's back to stop him at the sixtieth diagram. That's where the name Tui Bei Tu comes from. I'm only writing a few essays now and haven't concerned myself with future generations. But I often feel that someone is pushing my back to stop me. Well, now I've compiled these seventy-odd pieces into a collection, and that's finally a small ending. If I have to say that "Collected Essays of Tui Bei" has any meaning, then that's my meaning!</p>
<p>(Postscript) "Collected Essays of Tui Bei" will be published by Tianma Bookstore and is currently in print. It will be available to readers within half a month.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Metamorphosis of the "Orange" (Part 2) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>In Hunan, near Dongting Lake, has always been famous for producing oranges. However, some say that Wei Yingwu's line "Dongting must wait for the frost to fill the forest" refers to the Dongting Mountain in Taihu Lake, because he once served as the governor of Suzhou, so his poem mentions it. At the same time, we can cite some evidence regarding the production of oranges in Dongting Mountain, such as Wang Wei's poem to a friend going to Yuezhou, "Wind ferries Ruoye Road, frost bridges Dongting autumn." Also, Su Zimei's Gusu poem has the line "Dongting tangerines are ripe, guests share gold." According to ancient geography books, the Dongting Lake of Chu has a subterranean passage to the Dongting Mountain of Wu, so it is called Dongting. Fanciful myths, of course, are unreliable. However, the same production of oranges in both places has the record of the ancients to rely on. The Classic of Mountains and Seas says "The mountain of Dongting, its trees are mostly oranges." I don't remember clearly whether it was in Chu or Wu. Also, according to the Xiangyang Records, "Li Shuping, on his deathbed, instructed his son, 'In Longyang Continent, there are a thousand wooden slaves, and when the tangerines and oranges ripen, you will get a thousand bolts of silk per year.'" Longyang is now Hanshou in Hunan. Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty said, "Oranges are on the side of the lake, and people of low status do not spread them." Liu Jinchen's Ode to the Orange says, "Living in Southern Chu." Xie Huilian's Ode to the Mandarin Orange says, "I am entrusted to the district of the lake." Also, in the third year of Chongning in the Song Dynasty, the Great Liao envoy Xie gave a table of mandarin oranges, saying: "The fragrance fills the sleeves, dyeing the clear frost of the Xiang River. The cloud liquid fills the plate, drawing the remaining moisture of Dongting." It can be seen that Hunan has always produced oranges, and Dongting oranges are a very valuable fruit.</p>
<p>If the Tribute of Yu says, "The Huai and Hai region is only Yangzhou, its oranges and pomelos are offered in tribute," and Yangzhou indeed includes the present-day areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, then we can examine the wide area of orange production in ancient China. Also, Zuo Si's Rhapsody on the Capital of Shu has "Households have gardens of oranges and pomelos," which proves that Sichuan also produced oranges in ancient times. The Records of Strange Things says: "Giao Chi has a mandarin orange official, with a rank of two hundred shi, in charge of the annual tribute of imperial oranges." Also, the Accounts of Strange Things says: "The more mandarin oranges are drawn, the more bridge taxes there are." Since the Han Dynasty, what has been called Giao Chi and Southern Yue is now the area of ​​Guangdong and Guangxi, and also includes part of Annam. This place was naturally the place with the most orange production in the Han Dynasty. Originally, oranges like warmth and fear cold, and are most suitable for growing in the south. The best ones grow in the Pearl River basin, the second best grow south of the Yangtze River, and the species will change when grown north of the river. I remember that Yanzi's Spring and Autumn Annals said, "The mandarin orange becomes a tangerine when born south of the Huai River, and a trifoliate orange when born north of the Huai River. The leaves are similar, but the taste of the fruit is different. Why is this? The water and soil are different." The Records of Natural History also says, "An orange crossing the river transforms into a trifoliate orange." The Materia Medica has trifoliate orange peels, saying, "The people of Jiangzuo call it Wu stinky oranges." Also, Pan Anren made a poem for Jia Mi to give to Lu Ji, saying, "It is called a tangerine in the south, and an orange when crossing north." The tangerine cannot cross north either.</p>
<p>Oranges and tangerines are two different fruits, but the ancients often did not distinguish them clearly. The words of the ancients about oranges quoted above often involve tangerines. Dongpo's Collection has a poem about Liu Jingwen's collection of Wang Zijing's posts, saying that "Your family has two lines of twelve characters, and the spirit overwhelms Ye Hou's ten thousand rooms." Dongpo Jushi once said, "It is said that Wang Zijing's post has the words 'Three hundred yellow tangerines.' This post is in the house of Liu Jisun Jingwen. Jingwen died, and I don't know whose house it is in now." It was originally Wang Youjun Yizhi's post, but Dongpo mistakenly thought it was Wang Daling Xianzhi's post; it was originally three hundred mandarin oranges offered, but Dongpo mistakenly thought it was three hundred yellow tangerines; however, it is not only Dongpo who made the mistake of not distinguishing tangerines and oranges. In Hunan, not only are finger-like Buddha's hand tangerines and bowl-sized pomelos clearly distinguished, but jiu, which are only for ornamental purposes, are also clearly distinguished. Tangerines and oranges are different, and they are also different from oranges. Tangerine peels are yellow and not red, and have a stinky smell, or are called Ao-skinned tangerines, and are sour and not sweet. Oranges are larger than tangerines and smaller than pomelos. The skin is green and not red, like bergamot, but it is not fragrant and cannot be eaten. However, Xinhui oranges and Wenzhou tangerines are delicious, and it can certainly be said that "the water and soil are different!"</p>
<p>Wenzhou tangerines are slightly bitter, but there is sweetness in the bitterness, and the taste is not bad. When Han Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty was an official in Wenzhou, he wrote a Mandarin Orange Record, the first volume saying oranges and tangerines, the middle volume saying oranges, and the last volume saying planting methods. Tangerines are a famous product of Wenzhou, and it can be said that there is a book specifically for them. Some say that Xinhui oranges are just tangerines because Cantonese people call tangerines sweet oranges and call honey oranges tangerines, so there is a distinction between tall oranges and flat tangerines. I think Guangdong honey oranges are better than Siamese honey oranges, but the taste of Fujian honey oranges is similar to that of Hunan oranges. Although Nanfeng honey oranges are small, the taste is not bad. The smallest is Ji'an golden oranges, which are even smaller than pigeon eggs. The taste is in the skin. Ouyang Xiu's Returning to the Fields Record says: "Golden oranges are produced in Jiangxi, and are transported from afar. The people of the capital did not know them at first. At the beginning of Mingdao Jingyou, they first came to the capital with bamboo shoots. The bamboo shoots tasted sour, and people did not like them very much. Then they were no longer produced. Golden oranges tasted delicious and were placed between cups and plates. The brilliance was shining, and they were like bullets now, which are truly precious. The people of the capital did not value them very much at first, but later, because the Concubine Wencheng liked to eat them, the price increased in Tokyo. I lived in Jiangxi and saw that the people of Jizhou were very fond of this fruit. Those who want to keep them for a long time store them in mung beans, which can be kept unchanged for a long time, saying that the nature of mandarin oranges is hot and the nature of beans is cool, so they can last for a long time." Jiangxi golden oranges were regarded as a precious fruit offered to the imperial court during the Northern Song Dynasty. Nowadays, although the ancient meaning of worshiping gold is prevalent, with gold in the first place, golden oranges are not very expensive. Two coppers buy two, and even Shanghai children do not like to eat them. Only the Jinshan honey oranges from the Jin and Yuan dynasties reign supreme for a time. You see, aren't there Huahong honey oranges for sale in Shanghai fruit shops all year round?</p>

<h3 id="e183">Three Hates <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>The electric light suddenly went out, and the small shrine was cut off from its breath, swelling from the inside out. The oil lamp on the shrine also seemed to die once, and then slowly come back to life. Someone lit a tallow candle, and a faint, wavering light floated around—the ancient life of centuries ago began around us.</p>
<p>In a quiet, undiscovered corner, a faint dampness emanated. Small cockroaches crept stealthily back and forth in front of my seat. Worker Ahan, young student Fan Zengguang, and his female classmate Chen Qi sat side by side to my right, almost equally spaced. They didn't seem to have moved a muscle.</p>
<p>Hate is a common characteristic of all of us. In ten years, I have never met a purely happy person—there are no such people in China. We breathe in hate, we eat and sleep in it. It occupies as important a position as oxygen. Because Fan Zengguang was determined to make an interesting proposal, it was chosen as a topic for these young people to discuss.</p>
<p>"Okay, you go first."</p>
<p>Ahan said without hesitation,</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, that's the way it is. I hate the kind of person who doesn't have the guts and pretends to be a hero in a place where they shouldn't have the guts... Ask them, they all hate this kind of bastard as much as I do! When it comes to fighting, he's the first to yell, "Bring more, be more aggressive!" He's the first to challenge others, saying, "Got anything to protect? I'll punch you in the chest!" But later... he's the first to get a stomachache!"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed. When it was Chen Qi's turn, she told me in a sharp voice with a burning, stimulating quality,</p>
<p>"My world is small. We don't fight. Therefore, I hate a kind of person who promises you something to your face but doesn't do it afterwards. He never refuses you to your face for something he is determined not to do. There are these hypocritical characters everywhere... I can't forgive him even when I die."</p>
<p>"I also hate a kind of hypocritical character, and I can't forgive him even when I die. But that person is very different from what you're talking about!"</p>
<p>Fan Zengguang shouted excitedly, but then fell silent, looking at everyone in turn before slowly saying:</p>
<p>"This is a short story about love. There was a girl who was very close to me, and we were both very happy. In happiness, we also planned our future in all aspects... But, like all love affairs, she left me for a more glorious goal. At that time, we all liked to call girls "scenery"... Two years later, this scenery came back to me... But I knew her past completely. She had a lover to be proud of. Her lover was a financier who had recently made a fortune from a speculative business.</p>
<p>"I am foolishly devoted, so I still love her the same. Everything is loyal to her. She is a beautiful and charming girl, so she is naturally cunning. She needs my love, but she doesn't need my loyalty—as if that's worthless, ragged cloth. I asked her about something, and she always said she didn't know. She declared that she had never had a lover. "Didn't a certain financier recently make a fortune?" "I have never had a friend who is a speculator in my life." This scenery sees me as a fool! If one day I am escorted to the execution ground to be beheaded, I will still curse her in the red light of blood!..."</p>
<p>While speaking, his long body straightened more and more, as if he wanted to stretch out infinitely, becoming frighteningly thin. Now, like a rubber band, he shrank suddenly and bent to the ground.</p>
<p>Everyone pondered for a while in his narration.</p>
<p>"Now, let's have Uncle Wei tell us."</p>
<p>Someone suggested, but I didn't say anything. Hate is not the same for everyone. In opposite moods—or interests—there are opposite responses. It is meaningless to just point out the hateful aspects of human beings. People do not live to insult others... In fact, I share all three of these hates.</p>

<p>From what place did it fly,</p>
<p>I can't remember anymore.</p>
<p>A melancholic</p>
<p>Drizzling spring dusk.</p>
<p>How did it die,</p>
<p>I can't remember anymore.</p>
<p>Accompanied by faded green peaches,</p>
<p>And red and blue ink.</p>
<p>Send this miserable corpse to her,</p>
<p>To coax two drops of tears from her:</p>
<p>But she has already stopped crying,</p>
<p>That burning, solid heart.</p>

<p>— Zi Chen</p>
<p>Who knew that just stepping out the door, he would run into Little Erzi. Panting anxiously, he yelled at his mother: "Hurry! Hurry! His load was knocked over by someone, and he's fighting with someone. He's going to the police station!"</p>
<p>Mother's hands were shaking uncontrollably. She dropped the two children and said to Little Erzi, "Little Brother Er, please take them back!" Saying that, she ran off. She also dropped the keys.</p>
<p>Little Maotou was about to cry, but Little Erzi coaxed her. Little Monk was a little scared. He saw a group of people fighting across from the reflective wall. Bowls and plates were smashed on the ground. Mother was running there.</p>
<p>Little Erzi led the two children home. Walking under the white powder wall, they still wanted to watch the excitement. They stretched their heads to look, but there was no one on the high frame. The long plank also fell to the ground with one end跷跷板 in the air. They pushed the railing, but it was locked. Little Erzi urged them to go home, and Little Monk took another look at the long plank and the frame underneath it.</p>
<p>Little Erzi went back to sell sugar candy and told them not to go out. Mother was helping Father to fight, and she would be back in a moment.</p>
<p>The two children didn't know what to do. After waiting for a long time, Mother still didn't return. Little Maotou was digging up mud and kneading round balls, trying to make a ball like the ones people kick. But no matter how much she kneaded, it was always too small. Little Monk tried to move a bench against the wall, wanting to climb up and look down. The bench wouldn't stand still, and he couldn't climb up. With a crash, the bench fell over, and Little Maotou's ball was also crushed.</p>
<p>Little Maotou started to cry. Little Monk tried to coax his sister like an adult. His sister ignored him, and he became anxious. He wanted to think of something to make her laugh. Suddenly, he saw the bed where Father slept. The mattress on the bed was lifted, revealing a few long wooden planks. He pulled his sister and ran towards the bed: "Play with that plank!"</p>
<p>Little Maotou rolled her eyes. She also thought of "that plank." How to play with it?</p>

<h3 id="e186">Widows' Club Organization <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Yuan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: "Ms. Ding Xiuzhen of Yunxiao County, Fujian, comes from a prominent family. She married young, but unfortunately, before her beauty faded, she lost her husband. The solitary lamp and lonely quilt brought much sorrow. Ms. Ding, being without a husband and finding her empty bed difficult to bear, married a Mr. Overseas Chinese and went to the Philippines. However, the local customs were strict, and they treated her with disdain, subjecting her to cold ridicule and making things difficult for her. Now that her husband has passed away again, Ms. Ding had no choice but to return home. Unexpectedly, the villagers were all ashamed to associate with her. At this point, Ms. Ding felt even more bored. Fortunately, she inherited a substantial estate from her late husband, so she donated 500,000 yuan and gathered like-minded widows to organize a widows' club, giving those who sympathize with each other a place to gather and have fun. It is currently under construction and will be established within September. It will include a theater, dance hall, library, billiard room, and golf course, allowing the widows to express their feelings and avoid other delusions."</p>
<p>This clearly tells us that if one has superior wealth, there are ways to respond to ridicule, although it is not necessarily to organize a widows' club.</p>
<p>Now, this club is about to be established. According to the communication, most of its facilities are for entertainment. Entertainment is a need in life, but it is not life itself. Therefore, using entertainment to eliminate physiological needs is insufficient. It may not be wrong to say that Ms. Ding's facilities are flawed. We must understand that if a person's life is stable, mental pain is greatly reduced. In a society with extreme economic panic, such stability is impossible, especially for women. Under the revivalist wave, some are forced back into the family, while others are ridiculed for remarrying. The establishment of this club is to provide entertainment and comfort to these widows who cannot remarry.</p>
<p>However, with a little thought, we realize that the widows who can participate in entertainment are not the ones without money, but the wealthy ones. Fundamentally, Ms. Ding belongs to the wealthy class, so she naturally will not focus on another group of people. Moreover, the fact that this club includes some widows as like-minded (chaste) only gives powerful support to the revivalist movement, allowing feudal forces to raise their heads higher, which means heavier oppression of women in opposition to feudalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps some will say that the organizers of the club themselves may not think this way, and the above judgment is unjust to them. But we believe that objectively, they are unintentionally or intentionally using entertainment to anesthetize people.</p>

<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>At that time, I was still a child. I remember, clearly remember, in that distant south, a south with many banyan trees, I loved to dream; and I also remember among those many dreams there was one that was not a dream, but reality. —</p>
<p>Alone I walked to the wilderness, a clear and desolate wilderness that had just been washed by a storm. This was a place I was used to, I was very familiar with it, because often when I had no companions, I would throw myself into its embrace, let it comfort my loneliness, let it nurture my weak heart. This time was no exception. After wandering around, I naturally came to the old banyan tree that had accompanied me from the days I began to understand things until then.</p>
<p>The old banyan tree was also very desolate. According to my uncles, it had lived alone for hundreds of years, without any other locust or cypress trees to accompany it, because</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>the soil in this wilderness was originally barren, and planting other vegetable trees or shade trees would not allow them to grow. Therefore, it lived a solitary life for hundreds of years. Perhaps we shared the same feelings, but I always lingered with it. As long as I had a chance, I would accompany it to live my lonely life. From childhood, gloominess covered my eyes. And perhaps this lonely old banyan tree lived an even more terrible life than me—I often heard it crying.</p>
<p>Its crying was very faint, only the small stream that flowed continuously beside it could hear it; and my small building was built beside the stream. Sometimes in the dead of night, the small stream often carried its crying into my ears. When I heard it, my heart was sad. Although I lived alone, I could still find a stable place to sleep at night, but the old and lonely tree only had crying left to prolong its life. At such times, I often thought of going to see it immediately, but even if I strained my eyes at the window, I couldn't see it, because the small stream just made a bend there. On such a night, I would lose sleep, my eyes facing the two huge dots hitting the window, as if hitting my heart, making me feel extremely sad.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up early in the morning, without even wiping my face, and hurriedly walked into the embrace of the wilderness, closer to the pitiful and lonely old banyan tree. I looked at the fallen leaves all over the ground, and I almost couldn't help crying. I picked up a piece of yellowed fallen leaf, held it in my arms, and was about to take it back when suddenly, with a heavy thud, another fallen leaf floated onto my head. Before I could catch it, it floated into the stream.</p>
<p>— Oh, even the tender green leaves are falling?</p>
<p>I stared in horror at the tender green banyan leaf, and my heart became even sadder. I was guessing in my heart, using all my understanding at that time, but I couldn't figure it out. Only the yellowed and old leaves would be torn apart by the storm, how could such a leaf that had not yet grown be eliminated as well? So I came up with many reasons, but I was still not very clear: so I blamed the storm even more. The terrible storm cruelly blew down even this leaf that had not yet grown, allowing its prematurely aged body to live the drifting life of those insulted and harmed.</p>
<p>The rapid current of the stream showed no mercy, it wrapped this tender green fallen leaf in its embrace and sent it all the way downstream. At that time, with a martyr-like sorrowful mood, I followed the stream, all the way sending off the fallen leaf that could not withstand the wind and rain. I watched its tiny body stubbornly struggling in the rapid current, and I was gradually moved. The stream made a bend, and I quickly climbed onto my small building, watching my little companion gradually drift away from me. I raised my hand, silently praying for it, and I no longer cursed the storm, I prayed for its efforts and struggles.</p>
<p>When its shadow also disappeared, I felt that my face was in the wind and rain, I closed the window and collapsed on the bed.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Lucheng Town <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Just like that, we rested. The time was not early, but not late either. The hands of the clock clearly pointed to six.</p>
<p>Regarding the place where we rested, although it left us with some faint shadows in our impression, we were very vague about its substance. How many families lived in this town, what did it produce, and what position did it occupy in the collapse of the countryside? We had no way of knowing these things. Time determined our journey, and those things required considerable time!</p>
<p>After landing at the inn, the first thing we wanted to know was naturally the name of this town. Therefore, the porters almost became our only opponents in our eyes. What was the result? The opponents disappeared into the other end of the town in the chaotic air. A porter familiar with the path told us that this was Lucheng Town.</p>
<p>If I were to say that I had buried a deep impression in my memory, then Lucheng Town is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Whether in form or area, it was a cut above the rest. The entrance was a confluence, but when we left, it left two forks. In this V-shaped town road, besides the inns, there were also quite a few small businesses. Perhaps it should be considered a characteristic? In the town, you couldn't see the sky. The roofs on both sides were tightly pressed down by something, not letting in the wind or the sun. Everything was surrounded by darkness, and the people's faces showed a terrible iron-blue color.</p>
<p>The sedan chairs and belongings were supervised and placed on the roof racks specially built in the inn (note). Thus, we walked into the second courtyard.</p>
<p>In front of the second courtyard, there was a large yard. The top of the yard, like the town, did not let in air. Fortunately, there were a few pieces of glass that allowed us to see the color of the sky and the drifting of the clouds. At the same time, we could also see the shape of every corner of this inn.</p>
<p>After taking off the clothes soaked in sweat, "a thorough wash" became a necessary task. We filled the washbasins we brought and the ones the inn had with cool water, occupied them by looting, washed and wiped ourselves, while still grumbling about how hot the weather was today.</p>
<p>In a casual glance, I saw the inn's young waiter leading the teapot up the stairs in the corner, looking very unwilling.</p>
<p>——Ah, there are楼 floors here! I said.</p>
<p>Following these words, our heads couldn't help but raise. Ah, how should I write this? Right at the doorway of the room next to the top of the building, there was a young woman casting a slight glance at us.</p>
<p>Old Huang was probably stunned, not wiping the water from his head, and just stared upwards. The sexual thirst burned the long-dry seedlings in his heart. Maybe he wanted to test his edge? I thought. The woman was very open-minded. Later, she calmly walked down and chatted with Old Huang. Judging from her age, she was in her twenties, but she didn't have a bit of splashy spirit. All she had was some forced pretense.</p>
<p>The afterglow was driven away by the vast night, and the earth gradually fell silent, as if dead outside the town. Dinner was eaten in the light of candles. In order to invigorate our spirits from the day's fatigue, we brought the inn's smoking set, dug out hundreds of coins worth of paste, and puffed out clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we were all amateurs at smoking. The smoke often burned in our hands, and we couldn't get it to fit properly on the pipe bowl. Frustration and anger welled up in our hearts.</p>
<p>——Let me smoke it for you, the woman smiled, revealing two rows of neat teeth.</p>
<p>Surrounded by these young people in the wooden-framed bamboo beds, we didn't consider the speed of time, nor did we forget the solemnity of the surroundings, and even left tomorrow's itinerary completely behind.</p>
<p>The woman narrated her life story, drifting, stumbling, suffering, fighting against the demonic society with her lonely body. Finally, she cried, and crystal tears hung in her eyes. She asked Old Huang to sympathize with her unfortunate life, at least to hope that he could give some assistance in material terms. Of course, the so-called assistance was not empty. She hoped to exchange her body for the above price.</p>
<p>Old Huang's intention wavered a little, but he didn't reply immediately. The mountain wind brought the snores of the servants, telling us that it was already late. Because of the inherent instincts of friendship, I hinted to him with my eyes——</p>
<p>——Be careful, this harmful woman!</p>
<p>Finally, Old Huang resolutely let her go. Holding a belly full of anger, she resentfully resented the person who destroyed the good deed, and walked out in a huff, disappearing into the dim light.</p>
<p>Note: Roof racks, racks installed on the roof to prepare for placing things like sedan chairs.</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>The days passed as long and slow as the crawling of ants. In the countryside, no one will deny that this is an extremely depressing thing. When I drifted across the vast sea and returned to the embrace of my hometown, everything I felt was painful. Although I quietly returned to my village and saw my haggard, pale-faced, pitiful mother, her sickly, weak body always caused me pain. When the aunt next door ran over to see me, she quietly told me:</p>
<p>"Her body is getting worse. Look at her face! Not long ago, she fell ill, which was really scary. You've been wandering and haven't come home for two years. Now you should comfort her!"</p>
<p>Too unintentional! My heart felt as if it was being twisted. I was very ashamed, but what could I do? Heaven knows my pain. On the harsh journey, wasn't I always inseparable from the circle of pain? Now I have returned with my body covered in wounds. Seeing such an ugly mother, my heart was even more soaked in a bitter alcohol, gradually swelling like fire and burning. But at this time, I stirred up another thought, like a roar, like resentment, like tragedy. I will never forget the extremely selfish, gossipy, and mean aspects of the women in the countryside. For example, no one was ever willing to help my mother, but there were many people who gossiped about her behind her back. In short, the women in the countryside are all the same: people without thoughts. At the same time, I thought of my brother. Didn't he marry a woman for the sake of our mother? Why did he abandon our poor mother and take his wife to another place? Thinking about the painful breath, I tightly covered myself.</p>
<p>After returning home, I learned that my uncle, who had been in the United States for more than ten years, had returned. But when I talked to him, he seemed afraid that I would borrow money from him. Before long, he made an excuse to leave me. What a ridiculous and stingy person! Yes, these people occupy a large part of the countryside. I hated it and left my poor hometown unhappy. Leaving my poor mother again, like a person without a home, I quietly embarked on the journey.</p>
<p>But the countryside is indeed annoying. Before I even left my hometown, many local gentrymen talked to me about lawsuits in the countryside, such as the prohibition of opium and private sales! Assaults! Adultery! Many things had to be discussed with me. They all regarded me as a young gentleman who had returned from the city. But in my heart, this was all just annoying, just a despicable trick for the local tyrants and evil gentry to attack each other.</p>
<p>Leaving my poor hometown, I wandered for a long time in the clean and complicated county town. Everything I felt was empty. Besides the party's arrogance and the intense breath that occupied the breath of all the people, everything was just the charming but false big discount signs! Following the wind blowing from the southern sea, the bodies of the pretentious women swayed on the smooth cement roads under the white sun. Everything was no different from the metropolis, except that the place was so small that it was enough to make people feel bored in less than two hours.</p>
<p>In the evening, I took a rapid train to a friend's house in a village in the north of the countryside.</p>
<p>This place was very quiet, almost like being deep in the mountains. In less than two days, I felt the fatigue of silence and the extreme boredom of rural life. Apart from two or three children coming to play on the building, it was almost so calm and desolate.</p>
<p>At night, the countryside was already drunk in a circle of calmness and darkness. The high sky was as black as a vast piece of charcoal, and the small stars were flashing. At this time, there was no sound of dogs barking, no human voices. This was absolutely different from the sleepless city, how terrible! But sometimes there were exceptions, encountering two or three foul-mouthed women cursing each other in hatred. When the constant curses, unpleasant words, and loud noises filled the night space, I hated them for deliberately disturbing people's peaceful dreams. I felt very annoyed. In short, I felt that the uneducated women in the countryside were the most terrible.</p>
<p>Because of all the unfamiliarity, I couldn't help but quickly leave my poor hometown and quietly embark on the journey again, drifting to wander.</p>

<p>Opening "Modern Master"</p>
<p>Recently everyone admires modernity. The two words "modern" are remembered clearly. Regardless of men, women, old or young, everyone learns to be modern in a uniform way. Modernity certainly has the power of propaganda. Changing customs and habits, it is invisible. Some say young women modernize, swaggering through the city like vases. Some say middle-aged women modernize, taking one step and one step gracefully. Some say young masters learn modernity, increasing their excitement in the social field. Some say wives also modernize. It must be that the sun is setting on the Western Hills, approaching dusk. I say that gradual flow originally has no direction. What is there to rely on that wives are modern? There is a master who is sixty years old and calls himself the head of the family. He is also curious and learns to be modern. He doesn't use domestic silk at all. He says that Su and Hang silk and satin and Ling are nothing. Western suits and leather shoes are all imported goods. White clothes give off a strange fragrance of perfume. There is a tram road on the forehead. The inner and outer circles are unclear. The goosebumps on his hair are forgotten. He rubs on layers of White Jade Cream. He changes his diet and daily life completely. He still eats ice cream in the winter. The master is old, confused, and very romantic. He looks for another room to be a junior star. In the afterglow of a pear tree, the seaside case is good, but it is not spring. Even if he shaves his beard every day, his chin is always dark. He also learns the words of Qingqing, laughing at Liu Ling in the Neon Clothes team. He often dreams of being drunk and lost in money. He never wakes up for a moment in a day. The Lincoln horn sounds. The Dodge car comes home with a loud signal at dawn. Not to mention the furnishings at home, the small room is decorated as modern as possible. The whole family is laughing at it. His wife tries to persuade him with a bitter mouth, but he doesn't listen. He says that the young ladies and young masters are still in command. The master really shouldn't be. He follows the ten lines as a family law. Before long, a good family becomes a bad family. Although there is a lot of inheritance, the Xiang Yuan is originally similar. Sitting and eating for three years, the sea will dry up. One spring dream is entrusted to the underworld. Therefore, the two words "modernity" are arsenic poison. It is necessary to be very careful with comparing freedom. I hope everyone doesn't go too far with modernity.</p>

<p>Our local Qipan Street Baixin Bookstore, in view of the current era where both men and women, young and old, must possess a skill to establish themselves in society, and that "English" and "Japanese" are particularly important, has specially invited experts to edit two types of textbooks: "English Business Conversation" and "Basic Japanese." These were published today. To help students progress faster, starting from the 15th of this month, the Fuxing Radio Station in this city (frequency 920) will use radio to offer free instruction in English business conversation, every evening from 8:15 PM to 9:00 PM. The instructor will be Miss Zhao Jingzhu. Miss Zhao is a graduate of St. Mary's Girls' School in this city and is deeply proficient in English. Basic Japanese will be taught every evening from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM by Mr. Tang Zhenru. Mr. Tang is a graduate of the Literature Department of Meiji University in Japan and enjoys a long-standing reputation. With Mr. Zhao and Mr. Tang taking on this instruction, they will surely be able to do the job well. It is said that the price of these textbooks is extremely low. In addition to being sold by Baixin Bookstore, they are also available at the Fuxing Radio Station on Songshan Road and Xujiahui. To promote public singing, the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (frequency 1300) has specially invited Mr. Liu Liangmo, the director of the Shanghai YMCA Public Singing Society, to teach public singing at the radio station every Tuesday from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM.

<p>Film and stage plays are sister arts. Film actors also like to perform stage plays in their spare time. Similarly, in recent years, many people have crossed over from the stage to the silver screen, such as most of the personnel at the Diantong Company, who first loved drama before entering the film industry. At the same time, there is mutual support in terms of acting skills.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this cool new autumn season, it is said that all the male and female actors of the Star Company are particularly excited. For several days and nights, they have been rehearsing a script called "The Moon is Curved", starring Ms. Hu Die. It is expected to be released during the Mid-Autumn Festival. They have been rehearsing for over a month, and it is expected that this news will cause enthusiastic cheers from people who love drama and film. Please pay attention to the location of their performance.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Discussion on "The Peach Blossom Fan" <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Xinhua's filming of "The Peach Blossom Fan" has been completed, and the cast and crew have all released statements. Here are some excerpts: Hu Ping said, "The suffering of Chinese women is twofold: on the one hand, they are exploited as slaves in factories, and on the other hand, they are harmed by the remnants of feudalism. Therefore, here, we know that Xie Sufang in 'The Peach Blossom Fan,' an actress living in the old society, can still struggle and fight against various evil forces, and finally encourage her lover to go to the front line to kill all the enemies." Ouyang Yuqian said, "A stone statue is white, a bronze statue is yellow, and real people are never like that. Therefore, the establishment of the beauty of drama must first go through a negation of beauty. Understanding this principle can make a play." Gu Menghu said, "When 'The Peach Blossom Fan' started filming, I was asked by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian to play the role of Sun Daocheng in 'The Peach Blossom Fan.' At the time, some people said that this role did not fit my personality, but I have always advocated that an actor should be able to play many different roles. If you can only play a certain type of role that matches your own personality well, then the scope is too narrow. Therefore, I decided to take on the role of this "character" in 'The Peach Blossom Fan.'" Tao Mo said? "'The Peach Blossom Fan' is by no means an empty and boundless illusion, nor is it a utopia that vaguely relies on philosophical principles. It is a narrative of the great achievements of warriors who lived under evil forces before the revolution, were unwilling to endure layers of oppression and fetters, and wanted to seek freedom and welfare for the masses. In addition, it also gives us a considerable answer, pointing out a bright and upright way out." These are all very thought-provoking.</p>

<p>The Eastern Drama Society, sponsored by the Yueming Film Company and led by drama experts Ding Wanlai and Jinshan, has specially hired over a dozen experts to set up lectures to teach various subjects. The society will provide food and lodging and will absolutely not charge any fees. The purpose is to cultivate new talents in spoken drama to prepare for the application of large-scale sound film production. Since the society's advertisement for members was published in the newspapers, more than one hundred applications with resumes and photos have been submitted in just two days, and more than forty people have asked for application forms in person. According to the qualifications assessed from the letters, most are of middle school level or above, and there are also many university graduates and those with considerable cultivation in spoken drama. It is heard that Wan and Jin have scheduled a selection test in the coming days, and the method is quite strict, and the quota is limited to only twenty people. Therefore, the competition is fierce. However, according to the two gentlemen, they still welcome applications from those who believe they are qualified.</p>

<p>A certain song and dance troupe that had been drifting in Hankou has returned to China on the 7th. "Goodbye My Brother" and the troupe's big boss are hiding outside, and their families are avoiding meeting them. The small boss also had a considerable harvest.</p>
<p>Xinhua's "The Peach Blossom Fan", with large-scale publicity, failed to reach an agreement with the Da Guangming Carlton, and unwilling to give up this Mid-Autumn Festival blockbuster, contacted the Xin Guang. Yesterday, advertisements in various newspapers already showed "Opening at the Xin Guang Grand Theater starting from the Mid-Autumn Festival on the 12th." However, according to another source, the film will only be shown during the daytime, and the evening shows will feature a spoken drama led by Hu Die, "The Moon is Curved," which can be worth ten plays.</p>
<p>Wang Yin's son has recently been living at the home of his maternal uncle, Lu Lixia. There may be a problem here.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The Meaning of Modern Architectural Beauty (Part 1) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— By Taniguchi Yoshiro, Translated by Zhang Guangzheng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The appearance of so-called modern architecture can be excessively perceived as dry and tasteless. The richness of emotion is lost in the dull appearance, affecting people's feelings of unease about social life. Such criticisms are often heard.</p>
<p>But before making such criticisms, we must deeply explore the so-called "new architecture" of contemporary architectural masterpieces. Facing the simple posture and pure, unadorned nature of modern architecture, one inevitably wonders where the architect's painstaking efforts were spent. And there are quite a few people who think that it is simply a crude work that is very easy to design.</p>
<p>This is because in the past, many exaggerated, ornate adjectives and words of admiration for its exquisite skills were used to describe famous buildings. Therefore, the general public believes that without decoration, it is not a beautiful building, and without skills, it is not a famous building. Consequently, the beauty of architecture in the eyes of the general public is seen as the dazzling carvings and colors of the Nikko Tosho-gu in Japan, or the large scale of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. At the very least, one demands the extremely intricate marble decorations, such as the dense Saracenis temple. However, in modern architecture, one also demands high, old-fashioned spires like medieval temples, or the lavish construction of palace-style railings; using these as standards of architectural beauty, modern architecture, which lacks decorative variation, is judged as non-artistic. This view is not without exaggeration.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>But the architecture that new architects expect is not that kind of decorative architecture that embellishes the exterior with skills. On the contrary, they put the exterior into question. On this point, a fundamental difference arises with the general public's study of architectural beauty.</p>
<p>The starting point of modern architecture is based on "application". The architect's painstaking design is to seek how to technically solve this "application" problem. How to meet the internal requirements, and use this point as a factor in forming the external appearance. Therefore, the external appearance is only an expression of internal requirements.</p>
<p>For example, due to the necessity of light entering, the size and direction of the windows are determined by the relationship between the direction and part of the sunlight shining; in addition, opening ornate windows on the front to show off the appearance is not necessary. At the same time, due to the need for ventilation, technical attention is given to all the details of the structure of the windows, the method of opening, etc.; in addition, the technique of decorating the curve pattern of the windows becomes an unnecessary object that hinders light from entering and obstructs ventilation. The main entrance is located with the aim of convenient access; in addition, building it in the central part of the front to ignore the inconvenience of the location for the sake of the appearance of the grand hall is simply a violation of the fundamental spirit of architecture in modern architecture. According to the consideration of internal traffic, the configuration of each room is determined by the connection and its efficiency, so there is no need to insist on left-right symmetry on the appearance without being bound by the previous forms.</p>
<p>Today's architects hold this attitude: Only in the construction of government offices and other buildings, the so-called left-right symmetry can produce a solemn and majestic idea on the appearance, and the design conditions that are necessary for left-right symmetry are incorporated. Therefore, even in cases where the location of the site is disadvantageous, a large gate in the center of the front is still set up. The method of extending the two wings to the left and right is adopted, and the functional inconvenience that occurs inside is risked. That is, the method of determining the combination of the interior by the exterior. That, of course, requires artistic architects to handle. At the same time, it can also be said that in order to embellish the exterior, the interior is made to obey.</p>
<p>The claim of modern architecture is the opposite. Solving the interior is the fundamental problem, and the exterior is only an accessory; few people believe that the function of the building will still be expressed on the exterior. Consequently, we deeply know that the previous buildings were actually deformed buildings, violating the original meaning of architecture. So, they have collectively advocated that the necessary functional extreme expression of the building is the true posture of the building, and the true beauty of the building. The external engineering materials that are directly presented to the vision are aimed at maintaining durability in weathering. Inside, materials with heat resistance are sought to prevent the transmission of heat.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Analysis of the Interior of Ancient Chinese Architecture (Part 1) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>The construction industry in China has had considerable development from the 19th century until now, but compared with European and American countries, it is far behind. In this foreign concession of Shanghai, although there are also Chinese-built high-rise buildings of more than 20 stories, all the interior decorations are mostly imported, and the annual imports are quite considerable when calculated.</p>
<p>All the buildings in the mainland, whether they are palaces, halls, temples, or civilian houses, all the interior and exterior decorations can be said to be self-sufficient, and in terms of the firmness of construction, they are not inferior to all Westernized buildings.</p>
<p>Here, let's briefly talk about all the interior decorations of old Chinese buildings:</p>
<p>(1) Design - The architecture of Chinese temples is similar in form to that of India, encompassing layers of courtyards, corridors, kitchens, dining rooms, and monks' dormitories. The formal form is three solemn, single-story halls with parallel exposed wooden roofs, attached to wide staircases, arches, and bridges. Residences are similar to temples and face south. Outside the front door is a large courtyard with houses on both sides. At the other end is a large hall, followed by another courtyard; sometimes there is a third courtyard, which is prepared for women. Behind it is a garden. All the windows are mostly open to the inside.</p>
<p>The "threshold" outside the door also has a certain proportion in its construction. Its height is determined according to the height of the eaves from the ground: one foot and one inch, that is, the eaves are one foot from the ground. If the threshold is one inch high, the eaves are two feet from the ground, then the height of the threshold is two inches, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Concrete Ships (Part 2) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Pusheng</p>
<p>Now, let us put aside the historical description of the shipbuilding plans of various countries and briefly mention the advantages of concrete ships. They are stable and do not roll easily when sailing, do not leak water under normal conditions, are easy to repair in the event of a collision, and are difficult to burn even if they catch fire, all of which are its notable features.</p>
<p>Comparing this with steel ships, in terms of cost, concrete ships are on average only 60% to 80% of the cost of full-steel ships of the same load. If the two have equal deadweight tonnage, the hull of the concrete ship is larger, so it will be more efficient than steel ships when transporting bulky cargo.</p>
<p>There are three ways to build a concrete ship. Now, let's pick up Feng Xiong's book "Sanhetu" and summarize the main points of the method of building this type of ship for introduction:</p>
<p>(1) Integral Construction Method The entire ship is integrated, and the situation is the same as the construction of concrete structures on land. The bottom of the slipway is arranged with concrete bricks, and the entire hull is formed with plate molds. First, arrange the outer plate molds to determine the outer shape of the hull. Place steel bars inside this plate mold as the skeleton. The transverse frame and longitudinal stringer are framed and placed in plate molds according to their shapes. The bulkhead, decking, hatchway coaming, etc. are all built when the hull is about to be completed, and the method is the same.</p>
<p>(2) Separate Construction Method This method is quite common in the UK. According to the shape of the hull, it is divided into multiple grids. The grid frame is made as a whole and made of concrete, and the grid plates are separately made and embedded in it. However, there are also those who only make the main grid frame as a whole, and the remaining grid frames are all separately made and embedded, which is the same as making grid plates.</p>
<p>(3) Bone Construction Method First, use steel bars to form the skeleton of the hull, and plaster the inner and outer surfaces with high-quality concrete. (This is the method used by Lambot for the first concrete ship, which was popular in Italy). There are also those who adopt this method and add changes, that is, use steel bars to form a double-layer hull, fill it with concrete in the middle, and then plaster the inner and outer surfaces with concrete, which is especially strong.</p>
<p>Comparing the above three methods, each has its advantages and disadvantages. If used properly, good results can be achieved. Which method to choose should be determined by the size of the ship and its use; roughly, large ships for sea voyages should use the integral construction method, while those for inland river navigation are suitable for the bone construction method.</p>
<p>Since concrete, an artificial stone material, can be made into ships that sail on the vast ocean, if future research is deeper and the techniques are improved, it may not be absolutely impossible to make it into an airplane to conquer the sky.</p>
