<h3>耕地减少傾向之可虞恒</h3>
<p>據實業部中央農業實騐所之調查中國六十年來耕地面積迄今僅增百分之一。而荒地面積竟佔我國土地總面積百分之三三以上按去年五月間中央實業實騐所發表報吿謂中國六十年來農村人口增加達百分之三一。以是而觀中國農村人口之增加實遠在耕地面積增加之上人多食少欲求農村經濟之舒足自極難能矣且六十年來中國都市日漸勃興故人口之增加。當不限於農村。而耕地之數。一如六十年前。宜其民食日虞謁蹶。並其農業國之稱號。亦將失眞實性也。</p>
<p>按中國耕地之調查。已往已有數度。皆謂中國耕地不獨並未增加。抑且有减少之勢焉。如在北京政府時代。北京農商部。曾謂中國耕地自民三至民七。逐年减少。計五年之内。共减二萬六千五百萬畝之。多而全國荒地。則增至八萬四千九百萬畝。至民十九年内政部統計司。就五百六十七縣調查此種荒地。已達十一萬萬畝以上。若就全國統計當更不止此數。此類統計。皆足證中國耕地之逐年遞减。似與今次之調查。不無出入。然就大體觀察。仍不相悖。蓋今次之調查。雖謂耕地所增無幾。然以人口激增之故。此種現象。適爲中國耕地實質上减少之明證。且證以中國年來農産品之不足自給。洋米洋麥外棉之大量輸入。尤爲顯然。</p>
<p>中國人口。旣增加矣。照理耕地亦當隨人口以俱增。何以六十年來。不獨無增。反有縮减之象。此中原因。甚複雜。然其癥結。要在天災人禍之頻仍。租税之繁重。高利之盤剝。以致農民終歲勤勞。不獨不足以獲温飽。抑且無以收回其已投之資本。以是本爲自耕農者。數經憂患。卽成佃農。爲佃農者。更不能自給。復降爲流亡他如賣兒鬻女。草根果腹。餓莩載道等現象。幾成中國北方之常態。近數年來。東南諸省。亦被天災。農村慘象。隨處可見。更證之各方調查。則自耕農之數額。無論何處莫不大見鋭减。農民負債之百分數。亦日見增加。農産品之價格。復日益低。落農民終年辛苦。得不償失。已成鐵的事實。故棄田逃亡之數。亦與日俱增此種現象。苟繼續下去。則中國之耕地。自必更將日見减少國民生計。將有不堪設想之一日也。</p>
<p>近頃以來。我國朝野上下。對於垂亡之農村。已予以相當之注意。去年財政會議復决議廢除苛捐雜稅。然事實上。所蠲除者無幾。留存而未去猶多。此其一。再如對於農村之貸欵。政府與商人。雖已進行。然仍未有大規模之舉動。杯水車。薪無濟於事。亦唯如此故高利盤剝。依然爲患農村。此又需當事者之努力改善也。再如洋米洋麥。年來雖已增徵進口稅。然仍有大量之輸入。爲保護本國農業計。似更應提高農産物之稅率也。他如鐬路運價之减低。農民貸欵利率之限制。皆與農村之復蘇。有直接間接關。係苟其力之所及。我人甚</p>
<p>望當局之迅爲規劃實施也。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日在其預算咨文中、要求國會撥付一九三六年</p>
<p>財政年度工陙經費四·０００·０００·０００元、其數額之巨、爲歷届前未有、此外並提出國防費預算、海陸軍軍費計達九００·０００·０００元之巨、亦爲美國史上平時最大之數、總統並稱、彼未能如預期平衡一九三六年度之預算、根據總統今日提出之預算、一九三六年之經費、缺少約四·五二八·０００·０００元、使美國之國债達三四·二三九·０００·０００元之新紀錄、總統稱、如無失業救濟費、則本届預算本有平衡之望、該咨文係於今日下午十二時三十分向參衆二院聯席會議宣布、内稱、一九三六年之復興及救濟經費較諸本年度有削减之望、總統並未建議增加新稅、但要求國會再度通過業已期滿之特稅、總統估計一九三六年總支出爲八·五二０·０００·０００元、其中四·九三八·０００·０００元爲政費、其餘則爲復興及救濟之用、政府之主要經常費用如下、政府各部經費一·六二二·０００·００元、退伍軍人恩給金七四０·０００·０００元、公債利息八五五·０００·０００元、到期公債六三六·０００·０００元、賦稅償還六五·０００·０００元預算中解釋稱、國防經費之激增、係根據華盛頓及倫敦税海軍條約造艦以充實軍力所致、預算中之國防經費、共計七九二·四八三·０００元、其中四四七·二二四·０００元爲海軍經費、三一五·二五九·０００元爲陸軍經費、本年度之海軍經費則爲三四三·０五三·０００元、陸軍經費則爲二六九·七五二·０００元、但公共工程經費項下之國防費用則並無確數、一九三六年雜務工程項下之經費爲一八六·二七三·０００元、其中亦有國防工程及公共建築、本年度之工程經費則爲三七三·八九五·０００元、故國防費實際將超過九·０００·０００元、此可視爲羅斯福總統對於日本廢止海軍條約上之直接答覆云、美國現有陸軍軍官一萬二千人、常備軍十一萬八千七百五十人、斐律賓斥猴隊六千四百十五人、陸軍人數不致擴充、惟陸軍軍備將有全部增加、海軍人員則將由現在之八萬二千五百人增至九萬三千五百人、海軍陸丳戰隊亦不致增加人數、海軍經費則大部份用於製造新艦及航空母艦、已經開始製造之新艦經費一００·０００·０００元及將開造之新艦二十四艦均在其内、其外並有新艦軍械軍火計四０·０００·０００元、及航空母艦三五·０００·０００元、其中補充費爲二二·五００·０００元、新造費一二·五００·０００元、陸軍方面擴充空軍費爲四八·三八三·四００元、較去年增二０·七三七·０七二元、其中大部份係用於添購新機五百四十七架及訓練航空隊員、預飛機一千三百五十二架、總統估計總收入爲三·九九二·０００·０００元、查一九三五年度預算、政府總支出爲八·五八一·０００·０００元、其中政費佔三·三二一·０００·０００元、復興及救濟費爲五·二六０·０００元、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>紐約漢迪哈曼公司發表銀市年報</h3>
<p>（紐約）漢迪哈曼公司發表銀市年報、迥述一九三四年銀市情形、謂美國如仍收買、則銀市將繼續穏定、而價將再漲起、但其上漲之趨勢、則視財部收買之價格與數量而定、去年財部共收白銀約三一七·四００·０００盎斯、而在十二月三十一日尙未饜滿之需共一·一二０·０００·０００盎斯、有一方法可使收買大减者、爲依照减低金元價値之手續、以减低銀元價値耳、然此僅爲一種可能性、去年銀價苟無國庫之收買、則將低落一角、而非漲起一角、估計去年世界白銀産量約一八一·二００·０００盎斯、其中美國産一五·五００·０００盎斯、墨西哥七五·０００·０００盎斯、加拿大一六·三００·０００盎斯·南美一六·０００·０００盎斯、其他諸國四八·四００·０００盎斯、其他來源爲中國之出超二００·０００·０００盎斯、印政府在倫敦之售出三０·０００·０００盎斯、及俄國之售出二五·０００·０００盎斯、以上共達四三六·二００·０００盎斯、去年世界白銀之銷費爲四三六·二００·０００盎斯、其中美國收進三一七·四００·０００盎斯、墨西哥購入七·二００·０００盎斯、加拿大一·七００·０００盎斯、秘魯一·一００·０００盎斯、澳洲六００·０００盎斯、香港鑄幣九·０００·０００盎斯、古巴七·八００·０００盎斯、哥倫比亞三·六００·０００盎斯、其他各國鑄幣六００·０００盎斯、印度消費一五·０００·０００盎斯、德國一二·四００·０００盎斯、而美國與加拿大之工藝用去二五·０００·０００盎斯、英國用去一三·０００·０００盎斯、餘賸二一·八００·０００盎斯、則用途不明、該年報檢討中國白銀出口稅之影響、謂中國財政部以爲銀價高起、礙及中國貨物之出口、今統制匯兌、當可鼓勵中國貨物之輸出、此種觀念固屬不錯‘但其趨勢之能成事實、則繫於世界他國之能否購買中國之出品、此種購買力今猶缺乏、故中國貿易欲求入相抵、似在輸入之减少耳、如外貨輸入果因中國繼續行其保護匯兌之統制辦法而减少、則提高銀價超過一般物價之結果、將爲中國購買力之削减而已云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美購銀計劃緩和說保證不再提高銀價施公使電政府報吿</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）上海方面消息、謂美國政府已允改變其購銀計劃以助中國之說、今日此間未能證實、惟據可靠方面聲稱、美國不再過份提高銀價之說、則似爲中美兩國政府最近談話之自然結果、據美聯社上海電訊、中國駐美公使施肇基屢與美國務總理赫爾及財長毛根韜交涉之後、曾致電中國政府、謂已得美國保證不再過份提高銀價、今日未得見施公使、而中國使館其他人員則對於上海消息不願有何表示、據此項消息所傳、施公使向其本國政府之報吿、係稱美國已允設法於實施購銀法時不再吸收中國方面之存銀、此間專家亦稱、財部近來購銀數額較少、如突然增加、將擾亂世界市塲亦爲美國官塲所不願云、惟上海消息未能說明中美兩國交涉之後、究竟曾否議定在何處購銀、以代中國現在之地位、至於中國所提金銀交换一層則曾議及、惟在實行交换之前、中國之幣制必先完全改革始可、以政治方面觀之、此間以爲國會銀派苟不再加壓力、則政府絶對不願改變最近之停頓態度、卽使銀派實施壓力、政府亦將另行設法以謀對付、而不再增購現銀、關於此層、最可能之一法、卽爲减低美元之銀成份、如此、美國卽不需如許現銀、卽能滿足一九三四年購銀法之條件、且同時亦能提高國内之銀價、據稱、此法大部份銀派議員或能滿意、再據上海消息、中國金融界對於幣制政策之意見殊爲紛歧、銀行家貝祖貽主張中國銀元對於外幣之此價應當提高、而宋子文氏則以爲應任其自然、茲悉宋氏之主張將最後得勝、宋氏以爲中國銀元對於美元之比價爲成四與一之比、卽不能謂其不合常軌財政部長孔祥煕之高等顧問及著名銀行家多人亦贊成宋氏之主張、中國銀行家及商界多人最近曾反對現銀出口稅近來徵收之數甚低、稱此係貝氏之主張云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（柏林）德國社黨副首領赫斯今晚在柏林體育館向廣大之聽衆發表關於薩爾問題之重要演說、聽衆之中復有薩爾人民三千五百人參加、赫氏首稱、倘法國接受希特勒元首之建議、經過一度友善交涉之後、即自動將薩爾交還德國、則於政治事態之循序進展、必更可欣慰、但吾人今日仍對於法國表示熱誠之感謝、因法國政府即已感覺民衆投票之不得不如期進行、亦復以誠實果毅之心從事於籌備也、凡涉有增加困難之形迹之事及有損德法兩國情感之行爲、俱竭力避免之、因此吾人深覺法國政府此後亦必將重視法國民族對於和平之酷愛及公正之觀念、在民衆投票後、竭力與德國合作、使德薩之合併、在細則上得一迅速圓滿之解决方法云、赫氏繼復叙逑薩爾問題之沿革、證明薩爾土地實爲德國土地、千餘年未曾間斷、即法國史家亦能證實其事、故歷史上之問題、實較經濟上之問題尤爲重要、因薩爾之土地已侵滿德人之血、且受德人額上之汗所滴入、遂得肥饒、故今日之問題、完全爲民族問題、而薩爾之民族實自頂至踵爲德國之骨肉、且無時不思歸併於祖國也、在過去十五年中、彼等已咬定牙根、保持其德人之特性云、赫氏繼復提及上星期四國社黨領袖及國防軍在柏林所舉行之大會、稱參加會議者對於國家之首領即如此一致推崇、即全國民衆對於希特勒堅决不移之愛戴、將使國家益臻於光榮偉大之地位云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）昨夜有由美國歸來之薩爾投票人四百名、抵車站時受人民極熱烈之歡迎、宣傳部代表並在站演說、大意云、［當祖國召汝時、汝等應各盡天嬂、六千萬德人籲求和平與平等、希特勒爲和平之中堅人物、吾人應追隨其後、俾德國得安居於和平之中］云、（六日國民電）</p>

<h3>法意非洲問題</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾昨日午後會談三小時、旋發表一半官文吿、大旨謂法意兩國對於保障奥國獨立之公約已獲妥恊、惟對於彼此在非洲之殖民地事務、意見仍未一致、兩政治家現於以非洲土寺割讓意國事、爭之甚力、近兩日内、各助以非洲事務專家、以和好而堅决之態度應付此問題、意國之要求、根據於一九一五年加入大戰時英法對意所作讓地之語言、法意兩國这殖民問題、可分四項如下、</p>
<p>（一）吐尼斯之意僑得留其國籍者、應有若干代、</p>
<p>（二）意屬里白雅南面之土地、意國欲得蒂比斯蒂瑪亞夫以南之地、法國提議、意國所得之地、應以該區以北爲限、蓋恐法屬西非與法屬赤道部非地、有被截斷之虞也、</p>

<p>（羅馬）本日爲法國外長賴伐爾來羅馬之第二日、就本日法意談判之結果、兩國政府雖尙未成立最後恊定、然談判可謂已有重要之新進展、其中關於維持奥國獨立及發展多緇河流域經濟之公約草案、已在原則上成立妥恊、至於恊調解决法意兩國在菲洲爭端之草約、則正由各專家竭全力研討、以期成立兩國間之妥恊、聞意國已接受逐步放棄根據一八九六年法意條約、菲洲法屬都尼斯境内意國僑民應享受之特殊利益、其放棄之限期、尙未决定、但至遲當不出一九六五年、爲報答意國此種讓步起見法國允許修改一九一六年關於北菲殖民地之恊定、法國允許放棄意屬里比亞以南、沿底貝斯底山之領土、但乍得湖之港口、則不在其内、在索謀里闌方面、法國凖備改訂疆界、延長意屬愛里德里之邊界、並准許意國參加經營法屬直布地之鐵道、以供阿比西尼亞貨物之出口、此項問題雖頗爲繁複、然仍不難獲得公平適當而有利雙方之解决、因此法意兩方現均希望最後恊定、可於明日實行簽訂、以上四種文件正式簽訂後、其中第一種文件、卽法意談話紀錄、當卽行送交各報發表、惟其餘三種文件、則當於日後另行公佈、此外或將簽訂各項議定書、規定法意兩國政府、對於外交政策上若干特殊問題、取恊調態度、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（一）正式公報、說明兩國政府、對於菲洲殖民地問題及一般政治上各項主要問題、所抱見地互相諧和、</p>
<p>（二）意法兩國談話之紀錄、兩國允諾遇奥國獨立感受威脅之時、互相諮詢、並向奥國各鄰邦及奥匈帝國領土承繼國、建議簽訂一種公約、承認互相尊重現有疆界、而不干涉其他簽字國之内政、</p>
<p>（三）關於殖民地之公約草案三件、（甲）解决菲洲法屬都尼西地方意國僑民之地位問題、意國對於一八九六年、法意條約規定意國僑民應享受之特殊利益、將於一九六五年時予以放棄、（乙）與（丙）規定法國在意屬里比亞以南、及索謀里闌兩處、關於領土之讓步各點、</p>

<p>羅馬大開筵宴</p>
<p>（羅馬）昨晚華爾耐斯别墅法國大使署大開讌會、是爲法意兩國邦交史闢一新紀元、而意相墨索里尼之親蒞使署、參加讌會、此僅爲第四次、前三次之聘訪、則僅具有外交上慣行之性質、昨晚使署門前、電炬灼爍、照耀如同白畫、所有窗牖、裝置燈彩、皆仿羅馬式、署中伽拉廊、爲有名之建築、筵席卽設是處、貴賓雜逮、除意首相法外長賴伐爾外、有意大利國内獲得最高勳章之名將二人、一爲巴佗格里奥大將、一爲海軍大將泰翁狄賴凡爾、其他列度者、爲外次蘇維區、及拉索尼、意大利前駐法大使阿凡查那、那奚、及曼索尼三人、共次則爲伏爾比伯爵、阿洛亞西男爵、及意大利外交部與此次參加法意談判之各要人、而内閣閣員及羅馬城中社會聞人、亦均參預盛會焉、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德冷淡奥滿意</p>
<p>（倫敦）據路透社柏林訪電、德政府對于法意恊定、現抱一種保留態度、蓋以德國必須有數愼重研究此種公約、然後始能决定參加與否也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）關於法意兩國在羅馬進行之談判、德國政界保持極端保留態度、各報亦均未發表明切之评評論、想係當局授意所致、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（維也納）奥外長頃接見外報記者發表重要談話、頗重視意奥兩國之政治要人常相會唔、及與匈牙利外交代表時時會談、關於未來之文化恊定、則謂與意國訂立者全以互惠及完全諒解之精神出之、至於意法談判中之奥國地位、外長云、奥國對此談判深表歡迎、因此項談判完全出於奥國之忠誠有力之友邦、奥國對於此等友邦應表示無限同情云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）羅馬方面建議應請英國參加此次法意兩國所訂關於奥國土地完整之恊定、倫敦外交界不予贊同、謂一九三四年二月十七日英法意三國共同宣布三國政府對於維持奥國獨立之需要、意見相同、此宣言含有三國遇有必要時準備恊商之意、故英國地位、已因此明瞭云、衆信英國今無庸續發宣言、聞法意兩國政府對英政府關於此事之地位、現均滿意、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>專載</h3>
<p>對於修改現行商標法之管見</p>
<p>何焯贒引言</p>
<p>自民國二十二年十一月右司法院咨覆行政院、解釋現行商標法第一條第二項［商標所用之文字］中之［文字］二字［不包括讀音在内］後（見司法院院字第一零零三號咨、登載第一百號司法院公報），引起全國上下一致的注意，大家都感到現行商標法實際上確有許多缺憾，於是修改現行商標法遂成爲一種普遍的要求。　　在工商界方面，因與商標法有切身之關係，曾先後發表過若干篇文章，如陳栩園的商標法有補充之必要，胡西園的對司法院解釋商標意見，潘仰　的大可注意之商標法字形與讀音問題等，（均見上海各大報及第九十七期機聯會刊商標問題專號），綜合他們的意見，大都是主張商標所用之文字，應該包括讀音在内的。　　在政府機關方面，商標局亦會呈請實業部轉呈行政院咨請司法院對商標法第一條第二項再作解釋，而行政院於二十二年十二月杪，更自動的咨請司法院再解釋商標法第一條第二項的疑義。結果，司法院還是維持前次的解釋没有變更。</p>
<p>在市商會和會計師方面，二十三年七月間，上海市商會上因感現行商標法，頗多不適於工商業情狀，乃組織商標法規研究委員會，所選出的委員，都是上海廠商領袖，集合研究，以便提出意見，呈請立法院將現行商標法酌予修正（見二十三年七月十七日上海申報，時事新報）。這個研委會直至現時，還在不斷的開會討論。到了同年八月十三日，上海李文杰秦彦釗兩會計師，在上海時事新報上發表對於修改商標法之意見一文，提出意見六點。李會計</p>
<p>對於商標法都頗有研究，他們的共同意見，很値得我們的注意。</p>
<p>二十三年八月十四日，實業部訓令商標局，以奉行政院令，飭擬就商標法修正草案，呈院討論，特訓令商標局本其辦案經騐，就商標法中未臻妥善之處，擬具修正草案呈核。商標局於奉到這項訓令，對商標法逐條加以縝密的研究，結果臚列意見，於十二月十二日具文呈部。</p>
<p>以上是司法院解釋商標法第一條第二項以後，各方面對於現行商標法感覺有修正的必要所經過的大略情形。</p>
<p>作者覺得現行商標法，因時代演進的關係，總有多少爲當時方法者事前所應慮不到的地方。這不特在同法院解釋第一條第二項以後，才惹起全國上下一致的注意，就在十九年五月府令公布商標法之後，已有不少法律家對之下過多次的批評。中國社會的結構具有中國的特殊情形，這部與吾國方在抬頭的工商業有密切關係底商標法，應該如何地適合國情，同時又應該如何地適合法律底公平條件而成一部良好的法律，這是我們不能不加以深切的注意的。｀商標法之所以制定，誰都知道其作用在保障商標專用權，但我們試細心檢討現行商標法是否在適合國情及符合法律底公平兩個條件下，已盡了保障商標專用權之能事？我想稍爲留心的人，總會覺得其中不可無以商榷的地方。旣然有道種情形，法律又不是一經頒布即成鐵案的，遇必要時還有修改一途可資匡救。修改商標法之成爲一種普遍的要求，已如上述，茲就作者三年來辦理商標各案的經騐，於商標局正式有公文將修正商標法的意見呈部以後，把現行商標法應行修正或應行增訂之各點，再加以一度的問明。</p>
<p>一　關於商標名稱問題</p>
<p>翻開現行商標法，從第一條直至最後一條，其中絶未有過關於商標名稱之規定。這個缺</p>
<p>點，祇須明白商標名稱之重要，便可知道。無論何項商標，總有一個名稱，正如無論什麽人總有他或她的姓名一樣。普通一般的買賣，祇憑買者口稱購買某一商標名稱之貨品，賣者即給以該種商標名稱之貨品；即大宗的貿易，在買者方面，必定是在定貨的函電上，聲明定購某某商標的貨物而已，斷没有詳細臚列該商標之圖形狀態的。例如購買［白金龍］商標捲烟，祇消買者說一聲［白金龍］，那紙烟店的小伙計自會把那包或聽［白金龍］捲烟賣給你。這證明名稱是任何商標的一個重要條件，與商標本身是不可分離的。如果在同一商品有兩個以上名稱相同的商標，依前例有兩種以上［白金龍］商標名稱之捲烟，姑無論其商標本身之圖形記號等等是否相同，在賣者方面·一經買者稱呼，大可隨便售與兩種以上之一種。這種流弊，不是與商標法保障商標專用權之本旨大相違背？現行商標法對於商標本身之各項條件，如文字，圖形，記號，顔色等，均有明白的規定，何以忽略這另一主要條件丨丨名稱丨丨而不加以保障的規定？雖則商標局向來對於名稱相同之商標，是不准使用在後者註册的，但畢竟現行商標法没有規定明白，辦起來就不免有於法無據之感。現行商標法第一條第二項是規定商標本身之一切條件的，我主張就在同條同項，加入關於商標名稱的規定，那末，原條文應改爲［商標所用之文字，圖形，記號，或其聯合式須特别顯著，並指定名稱及所施顔色］。</p>
<p>二　關於商標文字讀音問題</p>
<p>司法院對於商標法第一條第二項規定的商標所用之文字，解釋爲［不包括讀音在内］雖曾惹起無限的批評，但法律一經法定機關解釋，便應依其解釋執行，則司法院這種解釋，無庸我們再行討論。可是就商標法的立法本旨來說，如果商標所用之文字不包括讀音在内，則投</p>
<p>的規定，儘量採用與已註册的商標所用文字讀音相同之文字，作爲商標，行其變相的仿冒，這就與保障商標專用權的立法本旨，大相違背了。第一，我在上文已經說過，普通一般的買賣，祇憑買者口頭說一聲買某一商標之貨物，賣者即能照賣給他。所以我主張對於商標名稱，應該加以明白的規定。名稱相同之商標，固然是足以令人誤購，但名稱讀音相同之商標，當然亦可發生交易上这混淆。此就商標名稱而</p>
<p>言，商標所用之文字，是應該包括讀音在内的。第二，許多商標，尤其是西藥的商標，是單</p>
<p>機］，［果能	克淋］等就是。這一類的商標·在買者的腦海中，祇構成一個極簡單的槪念：質言之，買者心目中僅能憶及那寥寥的幾個文字。如其商標所用之文字，不包括讀音在内，在同一商品勢必有讀音相同的文字商標，依法旣不能加以取締，則在買者方面，必然無所適從而發生誤購。此就文字商標而言，商標所用之文字，亦應包括讀音在内的。此外假定同一商品，有兩個商標，一名［蝠鹿牉］一名［福祿牉］，我敢斷言買者一定會誤購，因爲普通一般的買賣，賣者是憑着買者之口頭稱呼而給貨的。又假定在同一商品有兩個文字商標，一爲wrigley,一爲rwgly，我亦確信這兩個商標的並行，一定發生交易上之混淆，因爲許多買者常是僅僅記起文字的讀音的。總括言之，商標所用文字讀音上之混淆，其流弊實不亞於圖形，記號等的相同近似。商標局向來對於讀音混同的文字商標，如［陰丹士林］之與［銀堂飾靈］，［味精］之與［味津］，或名稱者相同的商標，如［魚首］之與［玉手］，stacombaa之與suckomb，一定是祇許其一註册專用。這種辦法，我認爲很能符合商標法保障商標專用權的立法本旨。但司法院之解釋案旣是不容我們不遵從，爲謀補救因商標文字不論讀音而起之種種弊端起見，我主張在現行商標法第一條第二項之後，增加一項，條文爲［商標所用之文字包括讀音在内，以各國國音爲凖］。（未完）</p>

<h3>中孚銀行鉅竊案</h3>
<p>電燈匠多配銀箱鑰匙蓄意已久</p>
<p>例假時在行工作盜竊二萬餘元</p>
<p>丨胡宏來等三人均在鎭江拿獲丨</p>
<h3>銀箱開啓</h3>
<p>皖人胡宏來、家隹康腦脫路康來坊十一號、向在仁記路一百零三號中孚銀行充任銅匠電燈匠之職、去＝年七月間、該行經理姜紹聖、因儲藏保險庫鎖匙之銀箱鑰匙損壞、乃令胡另配一鑰、詎胡此時即心存不良之念、於配鑰時、多配一個、私自藏匿、以待有相當機會時、作不法之行爲、及至去年行辦公、而是時行内適有電燈損壞、胡即均不到行辦公、而是時行内適有電燈損壞、胡即入行修理、並見有機可乘、即另招甬人孫瑞富·王小華·等同至該行、以配就之鎖匙、將經理室竊得保管庫之鑰匙、至庫房内竊得鈔洋二萬一千元、即行逃出、即將贓物分肥化用、當時胡以爲此事神鬼不知、故耒潛逃、詎至上月間、胡妻張秀花、因事赴甬、在寗紹輪被公安局探員在其行李内抄得手槍一支、即拘解地方法院、胡聞此消息、恐事敗露、即於上月十一日、偕孫瑞富逃往南京、在京與東人施海泉相値、施通知上海</p>
<h3>風聲頗緊</h3>
<p>遂又逃至無錫、後又改往鎭江、胡等至在東奔西逃之際、而共犯王小華即經總巡捕房總稽查處督察長陸連奎·華探長劉紹奎·在廣東路拘獲、抄出贓说四百二十五元、解由第一特區法院、判處徒刑一年六個月、一面陸督察長偵悉胡等三人匿跡鎭江二馬路二號大華飯店三十四號房間、遂飭華探目吳漢章·陳永貴·携带公文赴鎭、會同公安局於本月五日下午四時、將胡宏來·孫瑞富·施海泉·拘獲、</p>
<h3>提回上海</h3>

<p>租界自來水本年起收押櫃</p>
<p>此後糾紛恐將益甚</p>
<p>新聲社云、本市自受世界不景氣及農村破産影響、市民生活環境日趨衰落、各團體有减租運動之組織、業主以减租律無明定、未允所請、雖有少數業主、酌允减低、但閙市區一仍舊貫、故房客方面、以消極方法、積欠租金、業主亦無可奈何、因雖可向法院訴追、但亦不勝其煩、而房屋内所裝自來水費、向例由業主带收代付、業主方面、因積欠租金之故、水費亦延不繳付、英商上海自來水公司、以長此以往、公司方面、追索水費手續太煩、損失益鉅、故於本年一月份起、無論新裝或已裝之自來水管、一律須收押櫃金、以房屋之大小、用之多寡爲標凖、嗣後如用户水費延不繳付、而所用之水費、已超過押櫃金、卽行通知用户繳費、否則卽行照章斷水、此亦仿上海電力公司裝用火表之辦法也、但此種辦法實行後、公司方面、雖可避免一切損失、日後斷水糾紛、將日益增加矣、</p>
<p>解散合作辦法</p>
<p>三北公司新增船隻同盟各家表示反對</p>
<p>三北公司之新輪明興號、現已改建竣工、已定明日開班行駛鎭海、兼航寗波、實現預定計劃、惟同航綫内有太古·招商·寗紹·等公司、向來同盟合作、營業公　、以泯除彼此竸爭、今明興輪開航、於合作航業上發生問題、亟將詳情、分述如下、</p>
<p>同盟數年</p>
<p>滬甬綫内、近五六年中、太古·招商·三北·寗紹·等四公司聯合、規定寗波一路、分作四十二分半、其中太古之新北　輪占十一分、　紹之新寗紹占十一分、招商局之新江天占十分半、三北之甬興占十分、歷昕以來、彼此開誠相與、四家統計、以有餘而補不足、近二年中三北之甬興輪、年年攤進、太古·寗紹·招商·等船、均皆攤出、自四公司同盟以後、滬甬四公司輪、均有盈餘、</p>
<p>新船路綫</p>
<p>此次三北之明興惀、其航路雖爲滬甬綫、但到鎭海爲主埠、寗波轉成兼航口岸、因之鎭海特造碼頭、明興輪之營業、重在裝運鎭去貨、蓋鎭海作内地口岸、滬上運往該處及自鎭海運來上海者、在南關報出口、可以免納關稅、從此甬埠之棉花毛茶等運滬、改由鎭海裝輪者、亦可得免稅之利益、</p>
<p>合作難續</p>
<p>太古招商寗紹等於明興輪行駛寗波、在同盟合作之立塲上、表示反對於滬甬綫内再增船隻、蓋照現時營業、四公司苟能仍照原約、繼續進行、尙可勉維現狀、今一旦增航新輪、則一公司勢不能有兩船享受攤派之利益、故太古·招商·寗紹·等於本年之同盟合約、因之耒曾召集續議、在事實上難以合作、在明興開班之後、即將此數年盟約、實行解散、</p>
<p>竸航爭潮</p>
<p>近海航路中、本以寗波班之團結最有成效、運貨水脚、亦最固定、數年以來、若定海綫·通揚綫·崇沙綫·以及北洋綫等船、竸相合作、在營業上獲益匪淺、今明興輪開航後、據各公司言、打破盟約之後、滬甬一路難保不引起激烈之竸航、蓋寗波一埠、至今已有新北京·新寗紹·新江天·甬興·明興·鴻興·等六船、輪多貨少、勢必＝至跌價爭攬也、</p>
<p>甌江日漸淤塞海輪航行困難</p>
<p>招商局擬移碼頭挑夫等籲請開濬温州甌港、年來受山洪暴發、挾沙带泥、日漸淤塞、致使航路交通、大受影響、招商局擬改易碼頭、該埠之挑夫公會聞迅、大起驚恐、蓋數千人生計關係、紛電各方請求疏濬、此事關係頗巨、茲將近迅分述如下、</p>
<p>海輪難進港</p>
<p>温州一路、滬上衹招商局派有正班輪海晏一艘行駛、南市聯安航局之益利、亦兼行之、其他爲淺底木壳船、近數月中温州甌江、因受山洪所發挾带沙泥、而致江内日見淤塞、在退潮之際、水尺甚小、幾致五六尺吃水、故滬上海輪赴温、常須待水守潮、載貨稍重、便難駛進内港靠停碼頭、船舶進出、十分困難、</p>
<p>提議移碼頭</p>
<p>招商局温州分局、以營業關係、裝卸貨客、至多不便、而且原碼頭日漸淤塞、落水退潮、殊難航行、故特呈請總局、急須設法補救、迅將停輪碼頭另移至水深之處、方可使貨物起卸、免受阻碍、局内已派員考查、確係事實、討論之下、擬將温州碼頭移到狀元橋附近、另建新輪埠、以爲一勞永逸之計、此事業正在商業之中、</p>
<p>挑夫大恐慌</p>
<p>此事發生後、温州挑夫碼頭工會大起恐慌、蓋甌江日見淤塞、不再疏濬、確將使航诞道阻斷、萬一各輪碼頭移往他處、則衣食生計於此之數千名挑夫扩工人、均將斷絶生活、而且更將使甌江肇成道光初这旱災、乃詳陳得失利害、請求中央交通部及滬上招商局請予主持開疏甌江、勿移碼頭、</p>
<p>部令迅疏濬</p>
<p>交部得此呈文、已經轉咨浙江省政府建設廳、迅速派技術人員至甌江測量、從速開濬淤塞之區、勿使航道塞斷、一面再由部向建設委員會恊議疏開甌江工作、務使在短時期内使之實現、一面於移設輪埠事、則俟查明情形再定</p>

<p>營造廠主龔少亭勒斃姘婦戮屍滅跡</p>
<p>殺害後竟谎報警所謂姘婦捲物潛逃</p>
<p>事隔年餘一朝發覺表侄爲姑母雪冤</p>
<p>丨龔少亭戀新厭舊下此酷辣手段丨</p>
<p>市公安局偵緝隊長盧英、最近忽接到一駭人聽聞之吿密呈文、具呈人爲住居法租界八仙橋麥高包路恩派亞影戲院後面鼎寗里五號之常熟人谢寳林、（年三十六歲）其呈文内容、略謂谢有姑母顧阿巧姐、於去年陰歷三月下旬、被姘夫</p>
<h3>浦東人龔少亭</h3>
<p>及龔新姘侯氏婦人曁龔之手下工人李寳生·周保泉·等設計勒斃、死後埋藏數月、復又再度將屍掘出支解數段、深埋滅跡、請求伸雪等語、盧隊長據呈後、深滋駭異、初尙疑有别種作用、但因事關人命、乃密派幹員周培三從事偵查、周奉命後、遂秘密進行、未數日</p>
<h3>眞相乃吿大白</h3>
<p>綠龔爲浦東高橋人、惟年雖花甲、而好色性成、髮妻逝世多年、當龔届不惑之年、曾與常熟婦人顧阿巧姐姘識、此時龔尙係一普通木工、阿巧姐則在西人家爲阿媽、頗具積蓄、龔自與彼姘識後、卽利用顧之私蓄、經營營造事業、遂吿起家、現閘北西寳興路公興橋南　九二七號龔鴻泰營造廠、卽龔獨資所經營、姘婦</p>
<h3>阿巧同居廠内</h3>
<p>最近數年、營業更臻發達、已儼然一富家翁矣、詎龔飽暖思淫、因嫌阿巧姐姿色已衰、竟于去歲春間、又與本地婦人侯氏結不解綠、並另築金屋于克明路大順里三十七號、作永久藏嬌之計、惟事機不密、不久卽爲阿巧姐偵悉、於是妒火中燒、</p>
<h3>與龔時起勃谿</h3>
<p>不料龔因與新歡侯氏戀姦情熱、竟頓起惡念、暗中與侯氏設下毒計、于前年陰歷六月間、龔邀同髮妻之婿沈福福密商之下、卽于去年陰歷三月二十一日清晨、龔卽率同侯氏·沈福福·及心腹小工四人、携帶麻繩、潛入阿巧姐卧室、將其勒斃後、運屍至室外、掘成四尺許深之地坑一所</p>
<h3>將屍草草埋葬</h3>
<p>事後給沈福福酬洋六十元、令其逃往外埠避風、龔更一不做二不休、復于該日清晨、親至該管警所谎報、阿巧捲物潛逃、請爲查緝、並當時除在塲兇手諸人以外、可算一無破綻、卽附近鄰居、亦深信阿巧逃亡、不料事過兩月、至當年五月初旬、龔忽念及屍身埋藏不深、且不廠内地下、深恐一到暑天、</p>
<h3>屍臭必定外溢</h3>
<p>乃又賄通廠内看工之本地人周寳泉·李寳生·及阿桂·等三人、擬將屍身再度掘出、嗣因慮及廠内耳目衆多、未果事隔一載、至今年五月中旬、龔仍放心不下、乃又糾同周等三人、再度發掘、見屍身業已腐爛、當用利斧、將</p>
<h3>阿巧頭顱砍下</h3>
<p>再齊腰砍成兩段、用臭藥水一聽澆於屍身之上、再復以石灰、乃就廠内新建平房之第三後門附近發掘一六尺許之深坑、將屍身兩段埋下、泥土之上、復塡以水門汀、同時由周寳泉將砍下之頭顱、用竹筐運至北實興路朱家宅荒地上掩埋、上面覆以洋鐵碗一只、以作標記、事後</p>
<h3>龔卽重酬周等</h3>
<p>不料最近死者之表侄谢寳林、因姑母失踪年餘、生死不明、始具呈公安局請求澈究云云、分隊長周培三將以上情形偵查明晰後、立卽報吿盧總隊長、加派分隊長陳光炎、率同探員田榮根等、於前日上午二時許、乘深夜之際、飛馳前往朱家宅二號、將李寳生（又名夏寳生年三十一歲）拘獲後、又往龔鴻泰營造廠内將移屍之周寳泉拘住、旋又往克明路順大里三十七號内、時龔與姘婦侯氏、尙</p>
<h3>交頸高卧未起</h3>
<p>乃卽衝入卧室、一併擒住、帶回隊中、由盧總隊長提案鞠訊時、原吿谢寳林卽投訴前情、請求伸雪、詰之被吿龔少亭·龔侯氏·（年四十歲）周寳泉·（年四十八歲）李寳生·（年三十一歲、又名夏寳生）等四人、對於謀斃阿巧姊、毁屍滅跡等情、均直認不諱、同時又供出帮兇沈福福、年三十一歲、現在蘇州北市橋木塲頭五號川沙人王西留所開之營造廠内充當工人、當因事關命案、卽飭備文於昨晨併解市公安局訊究、一面派員前往龔鴻泰營造廠内發掘阿巧姊屍身、以便相騐、一面已通令所屬、從嚴查緝在逃之帮兇沈福福·劉桂生·兩人、務獲解究、　　包車夫誤服傷藥送命</p>

<p>他架着脚、在客人中間坐着，對大家的臉色都看了一看，微笑道：這爲難兩個字，意思很廣泛。並不是要人的錢，要人的命，讓人身體上不自由，那才呌爲難。其實就是讓人精神上感到什麽不痛快，那也呌爲難。譬如李先生剛才說，是這位姑娘喜訊到了。你没有想着，所謂喜訊，就是這位姑娘的惡耗。他說到惡耗兩個字，雖料着月英必是不懂，可不肯很直率的說出來，却還是把聲音略低了一低。李士廉雖是不大通文墨，這兩個字的意義，總可以懂得，倒有點愕然，瞪了兩隻眼睛，向程志前望着。志前笑道：這句話，我不解釋一下，你先生或者會莫明其妙。我舉一椿事實來證明。剛才，這位胡家嫂子，帶了這位姑娘，到賈先生屋子裏去。他們不但是希望着將來，就是在目前，他們還有個小小的希望，就是這裏的茶房小紀，在昨天晚上約他們來的時候，已經說好了。假使他們照約而來，有一塊錢送給他們。這一塊錢，在我們看來，自然是稀鬆而又稀鬆的事情。可是他們一家賓主五六口人，就可以管好幾天的糧食。在那二十四分没有辦法的時候，有這一塊錢，暫時可以維持目前幾天的生命了。所以小紀指揮着這姑娘搽粉抹瞪脂，换衣服，他都照作。結果是讓人家白看了一頓，據說還是轟了出來的。李士廉笑着摇手道：不，那賈先生因爲有兩個外國朋友去拜會他。覺得這位姑娘在那裏，是有些不便。所以請他偏暫時離門。（一０六）</p>
<h3>漢臯歸客談屑</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>丨新生活顯露朝氣丨</p>
<p>［天上九頭鳥，地上湖北老。］漢口碼頭的風氣之壤，竹槓之盛，一向是江湖上的旅客望而却步的，可是自從新生活運動雷厲風行以來，那市政方面，社會日常生活方面，確乎焕然一新，表現了民族新生機的蓬勃氣象。</p>
<p>街路上隨時打掃，連小巷裏都不見有垃圾穢物。公厠所都建築在地下，每隔開相當的距離，便有一口鐵欄杆指示著［方便之門］。</p>
<p>馬路上没有歪戴帽子，豁開紐口，或是口銜香烟的行人。走路時一律向左邊走，尤其上下碼頭，分道而行，秩序并然，絶無凌亂擠軋的現象。雇用車馬，全照定價，在警察的監視之下，絶對不許有敲竹槓的舉動。</p>
<p>奇裝燙髮的妖冶婦女，不能招摇過市。旅館之中，也斷絶了妨害睡眠及誘人墮落的各種情調和特殊氣味。一般的生活，是由浪漫而復歸嚴整，由弛懈而趨於緊張。個人的放浪而無限制的自由，是受了［禮，義，廉，恥。］的束縛了。而社會的風化，秩序，頓改了積習已深的舊觀！以上的話，是我從一個漢口歸客談話中得來的片屑。</p>
<p>［事在人爲］！誰說老大民族不能從這易知易行的新生活運動上作個復興的出發點呢？</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （天哉）</p>
<p>趨是　的人，＝越貧於同情，越是貧的人，越富於同情。</p>
<p>雪花片片落下來，遮没了污濁的世界，它可惜總不能長久。</p>
<p>尺能够測東西的長短，鐘表能計算時間，怎樣把人的心披露出來。</p>
<h3>練字</h3>
<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>六七歲時候，小學堂裏放學回來，就給祖母催着練字。</p>
<p>紙早給我找好了的丨丨一張包過東西的紙，展在聯檯椅上。祖母一手把住了［金不换］，一手按平了那方紙，繼引我坐下去抄書。</p>
<p>什麽都不成問題，祇是在旁陪視的祖母，坐來總和我太近了些。所以每當屋角裏沉寂下來，祇有一片淡黄色的斜陽影兒，在掛滿塵埃的牆壁上潛自移動的時候，伊那微弱的鼻息，扣在我幼稚的心絃上，往往會攪亂我感覺暫時特别靈敏的神經，使得那枝秃了毛的筆，平常到處亂塗，揮灑自如，那時愈要巴結，愈形慌張，愈是那末僵直着，不聽命。</p>
<p>字的好歹，祖母自已不會寫安字，倒還可以馬虎。不過成行的字，參差錯落，直綫變成曲綫斜綫，祖母老是看不過去。</p>
<p>縐了縐眉，伊呌我停了筆；憑自己經騐，拿紙慢慢替我摺成了横直交义的格子。</p>
<p>［ＸＸ，你要格外用心！秀才家裏的孩子，寫出字來，也和田角落裏放牛郎一樣歪歪扯扯，丢臉的哪！］</p>
<p>祖母丨丨慈祥愷悌的祖母丨丨看到孩子没人照應，不長進，心頭一陳傷感，語音略帶顫慄。</p>
<p>好人之所惡。到死，伊對我總是特别關懐。</p>
<h3>測字攤速寫</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>在路旁的一角，擺着一隻拐東拐西的小方桌，桌上的前面掛着一塊用白布寫的［文王神課，百言百中，至誠至道……幾個大字。桌的上面亂擠八糟的放着那些字捲，白漆的木板，秃筆，殘墨信紙，信封，木盒等物。在中間坐着的便是一個八字鬍鬚的測字先生，大號呌筱鐵嘴，戴了一副大圓圈的老光眼鏡，襯着一副枯槁而無血的臉，額上似電車路一般的皺紋，一條條的深刻着；但是他却帶着二十四分的神氣，提起了秃筆，醮飽了殘墨，在白漆塗</p>
<p>說着許多江湖口訣，所以引得一般常在馬路上巡禮的人們，都駐足在他的旁邊，像木偶似的對他望着，聽着。</p>
<p>筱鐵嘴神秘的江湖口訣，果然發生效力了，在人堆中鑽出一個青年，隨手從木盒裏拿了一個字捲，擲在筱鐵嘴的面前。</p>
<p>筱鐵嘴的臉上，立刻露出了微笑，於是停了嘴，向那個青年從頭到脚打量了一番，然後抬了抬他副老光眼鏡，拭了拭他雙能識風塵俊傑的眼睛，便說：［師兄！是問什麽事的？］那個青年含羞的說：［敝人的妻子，快要生産了，不知産男的還是産女的？所以到先生地方問個卦。］</p>
<p>鐵嘴似笑非笑的一點頭，把那個字捲展了開來，裏面寫的是個［食］字。</p>
<p>［呀］！鐵嘴神氣活現的說：［依照這字的推斷，尊夫人要養雙胞胎的，你瞧！食字上面是［人］下面加［玉］，就成爲［金］所以第一個是要養千金的。再瞧吧！食字下面是個［良］，在［良］字的右邊，加了一隻耳朶，便成爲［郎］字，所以第二個是要養令郎的。哈哈！師兄的福氣眞不淺［啊］！鐵嘴的話突然停止了，貪婪的眼光，注射在那個青年的臉上，一動也不動。</p>
<p>青年只有苦笑了一聲，似乎欲語非語的說不出話來，於是在身邊摸出大約十幾個銅板，丢在桌上走了。</p>
<h3>在吹岀的不景氣空虚地飄摇着</h3>
<p>— 隱涓</p>
<h3>御香縹缈錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>難道幾十年來的宫禁生活，動不動就有許多可厭的禮節或儀式包圍着伊，甚至當伊在睡覺的時候，也不能脫離這個包圍，而伊到此刻竟還不曾覺得厭煩嗎？伊可說是自己在作弄自己，束縛自己，不讓自己有半些隨意行動的自由：從清早到晚上，簡直是没有一分鐘不在那些繁文縟節的支配之下。就是今天上射圃去，依舊是充滿着紀念的意味，不能算是一種純粹的遊覽；所不同的祇是今天的一切禮儀，將不復在宫中演出，而將在另一所塲地上演出罷了！這一所塲地雖然對於我們的先人確有很密切的關係，但對於我們自己，却眞是再驀生不過的了。</p>
<p>路上經過了許多的時候风們這一大隊的人馬才到了那廣大的射圃的前面，進門之後，依着太后的主意，便直接望一座宫殿走去。這座宫殿的建築顯然是很久很久的了，至於限并，必然比盛京的那些宫院建築得更早幾十年或幾百年。幸而平時也派着人在這裏照管，所以還不曾坍壞；而當太后將到奉天之前，這裏的官府，想必又曾派人去重新修理過，否則是决不會有這様整齊潔淨的！這一座宫殿實在祇是一間休息室，每當一個滿洲的皇帝到這裏來射獵的時候，必先進這一座宫殿中來小坐一回，好讓外面伺候着他的人，去把那些關禁着的野獸放出來，然後再來通知他出去追射。待到玩得疲乏了，便再通進來休息休息。但每次躭擱的時間總是很短的，也從没有那一個領袖在這裏住過一夜，因此這一座宫殿的面積，比較尋常的宫殿都小，裏面只有三間屋子，建築也是非常的簡單。（二一六）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>印度洋上（下）</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>寳賽劃分兩大城區：在歐洲市區，个少摩天的高層建築，象牙色牆壁，襯映着蒼翠析棕梠樹蔭，頗悅目可觀。郵局，銀行，大旅館都設在這很國際化而又摩登化的市區中，不少雜種的混血女人，推着小孩睡車在公園草徑，或水門汀人行道上，悠間地散步。我們整整兩星期，在囚室一般的船上，久不見半個女性的影子，看到了那些受當地白種人豢養的妻女們，眞像是在沙漠中發見了綠洲一樣。</p>
<p>其次爲亞拉伯城區，街道污穢，行路時須掩鼻而過。市街十字路口，多咖啡店，土人披白色長袍，戴紅色圓帽，踞坐其間，亦有手持　國胡琴形的水烟筒，懶洋洋地在那裏消磨時間。滿街是像野狗般的羊羣，結隊來往，並滲有看守的人。在菜市塲中，可以看見許多亞拉伯女人，渾身黑衣，從無穿鮮艶色彩之布疋者，面上都蒙着黑紗，不能分辨面貌的醜妍。伊們留着蜷的黑髮，濃厚的眉毛，睜着兩雙圓大的黑眼睛，向我們溜視，其表情神秘之至。</p>
<p>亞拉伯人多信仰回敎，每日須跪禱五次。過回敎寺，因須脫鞋，且應納資破鈔，未入參觀。其地本在英法兩國勢力之下，但近年來意國商務亦漸形膨脹。市中屢見專門出賣日本貨的大商店，日本郵船過此者亦頗多。</p>
<p>回船已下午四時，我買了幾張當地及蘇　士運河風景片數幀，沖瞩在倫敦時所攝的照片，取値並不昂貴。寳賽的水果極便宜，肥大金黄的橘子，每一先令可購二十枚。我們有那個老嚮導做伴，隨地沾到不少的便宜。老嚮導伴行七小時，我們各人酬以一先令，他表示很滿意，再三稱謝而去。</p>
<p>次日到薩蓬Ｓａｂｏｎｇ，這是荷屬蘇門答臘島上的一個軍港，在新加坡的西南。據海員們相吿，該地是一個小村落，只有一條熱閙的市街。居民爲馬來種人，亦有不少福建廣東兩省的華僑。土産以水果香料爲大宗。間有出售貂鼠鸚鵡及稚虎者，可惜行襄羞澀，否則購買岩干奇禽怪獸，分送上海諸親友，亦可作新年禮物用也。</p>

<p>▲奥勃林代表已承認</p>
<p>▲好萊塢五日路透電　關於世界網球第一名選手潘萊是否參加職業網球選手圑之謎、今日已經打破、自奥勃林宣布潘萊將於二月二十三日來舊金山簽約之後、潘萊在澳當即否認、但奥勃林仍堅持謂有其事、但今日路透記者往訪奥勃林或其代表有轉成職業選手之同意、奥勃林最初之宣稱、完全出於誤會云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>藝術的社會性與自由性</h3>
<p>— 殘月</p>
<p>藝術自由論者，往往是把藝術在創作構成上的自由，和藝術品在社會條件中的自由混爲一談，企圖消滅藝術的社會性。但藝術品是社會的産物，不是憑空掉下來的東西，乃是無可否認的事，所謂藝術的自由限度，是祇能在於社會諸條件中的自身的發展的範疇的，無論一個作家有意識地或無意識地去創作，藝術品總不能離開社會這許多條件的形成或限制而存在，藝術家祇有在這範圍中，去施展他的在創作上的自由，卽使在創作家的腦海中視綫中，有着海闊天空的境界，但仍不能超脫這個現實，一切的理想的幻想都是决定於現實的條件之下發生的</p>
<p>如果說藝術是特殊的獨立性的，那這種獨立性，就是我所說的在創作上（藝術的構成的過程）的作家的表現手法而言。這是藝術家所賦予藝術品的藝術外在條件的獨立性，而不是藝術品的超社會的獨立性。在藝術創作過程中的自由不祇死抱着藝術的人們重視，其實一切作家都是重視的；在創作時，自然不必顧慮到種種的限制，儘可任意施爲，一個藝術家在創作中祇要展拓他的創作世界，可以不理會許多拘束，（自然先要有正確的觀察。）譬如一個人作文的時候，他不必顧到種種文法的成規，但每一篇文章裏面，總可用文法的成規來分析的，除非是一種囈語。</p>
<p>這種［盡你所能想的去想，盡你所能寫的去寫］的自由，是創作家在其藝術創作時的自由，而主張純自由藝術論的人們，就以爲藝術家卽有自由的意旨來構成一件作品，則這作品的評價，應該以藝術家的修養的程度及所給與作品上的［藝術性］的高下爲標凖，這見解實未免捨本注末。不知藝術家的感情和作品上的技巧的應用，雖有無限制的自由，但藝術家及其作品，總不能不寄存於社會上的，第一個條件的限度，應该是被社會所决定。［魯濱遜飄流記］，在其内容的結構上，故事的想像上，有了作家極自由的施展，就藝術言是成功的，但决定這種藝術成功和作者能够構成這種冐險荒誕的内容的，是當時的商業資本向外發展，需要找尋殖民地的這一種社會思想。具備了這種社會的條件，才能産生［魯濱遜飄流記］，才能使作者運用他的藝術的自由去展拓舖排他的想像的故事，齊天大聖在五指山内自以爲很自由的洒了一泡尿，結果他没有逃出如來佛祖的手掌，［不知道］和［看不見］如來的整個手掌，所以，他在五指山内以爲檘其自由。</p>
<p>創作家在創作時，爲要更能取得廣闊的自由境界，他對於這種道理是要了解的，他必須把目光和思想力施展在對事物已把握着正確的了解與認識之下，才能得到充分運用他在作品構成過程上的自由。自然，不自由是不好的，但自由而是盲目的自由，便會流於浪費與放緃。不能洞察社會動向的藝術家，他看不見廣闊的社會的題材，結果僅是在籠子裏（思想上的與技巧上的）賣弄小巧的［天才］，反之，對時代和社會有清楚認識的作家，他會瞧見更遠更大的遠景，他的事物範圍廣遠而且眞確。所以藝術的自由性，是：在作者創作過程中可以有運用的自由，而形成藝術品的諸條件却是不自由地受限制於社會。因之，藝術品的估價，必須以社會的見地作標準。藝術品除開它的社會的價値，它的［技巧］將無所依附。</p>
<h3>最後的傷感（上）</h3>
<p>— 莫輕</p>
<p>呵，可怕的傷感，今夜你又鑽進我的心頭來了！雖則，我曾設盡了法子遠避你，終究也只有這樣忍受的一法嗎？呵，我爲什麽不能變得更堅硬一點，難道是終身都要做着你的俘擄嗎</p>
<p>唉，遠離的人，我說，實在你也無用再在夢魂裏追隨我了。雖則，我曾以雙手把你送入深深的空冷之門。然而，那也不是你自己的甘願，而且也是很安適的嗎？爲什麽你竟也不能僥恕我呢！</p>
<p>唉，可憐的人！我說，我們實在可以分乎了。如今，我們兩個已經隔得這樣遠。你，上好去走你那平坦寛敞的陽關道。我呢，讓我來步我這自造的艱險的獨木橋吧。如今，我的生活已壤到無可再壤，你何忍更時常來攪擾我啦。</p>
<p>呵，如今我生活在這堆滿死人的棺材之中，難道還有一點什麽可以分享嗎？你旣然自背了你自己的失志之誓約，當然没有什麽可以追悔，而我，即使是比現在更壤的生活，也對你没有什麽懷恨。我只求你能安心忘却，也就開懷雪亮了。</p>
<p>在這裏，白天也有着兩頓不能下咽的粗飯，晚上就給我們幾個人像狗一樣地，一堆滾在這開了一個洞的，幾與八字形的屋頂相含接的天花板上，四周用短短的木板釘堅挾成一個棺材形的窄逼的棲身之所。說是不能透氣嗎？冷風從瓦縫裏鑽進來，在身上過來過往。說是能透氣嗎？却又尋不出一絲光亮。每日看着［鐺鏗］［喔唎呱一地帶進］付付的黑洞的棺材來，送喪的啛咽之聲不絶於耳。而近旁大電氣廠的巨輪之轟天震動，又終日摇撼着這疲勞之身軀。人是像整天都在翻騰的慘霧裏過活着一樣。</p>
<p>呵，你聽如今這深夜長哼的寒風，又代替了電氣廠的巨輪之震怒，包圍在四周吼囒。嚴冬早已來到，我還是蓋着薄薄的秋被。雖則，把所有剩下來的單前，一齊緊覆在上面，也究竟止不住終宵顫抖之身體。常是在中夜把穿得熱熱的上衣，在被有肚裏緩緩地脫下來絞在冷僵了的兩條腿上取暖。一會兒，却又顫抖了抵不住寒　的上身。有時候，整夜不能入睡，都在做着這種與寒冷打架的工作。</p>
<p>呵，在這種生活的悲慘形情之下，我不止是不能如寒風一樣地憤起而長聲怒吼，却在這深更半夜，披衣坐起，唱出這種傷感的調子，也不怕羞辱嗎？然而，我也是無法忍得住呀。我給你說：忍得住的，我都早已忍住了，不會作出這種醜惡的呻吟。呵，可怕的傷感，我求你從此離我遠去吧！</p>
<p>一周前的今夜，我也曾夢見了你那令人止不住悲啼的情景。數年來，我這從千百憂患裏磨成了鋼一樣硬的心腸，醒來時，也禁不住流了終宵之酸涙。呵，吿訴你：這樣的酸涙，我曾受過友人們的多少恥笑呀！如今，這一次，我還能向誰訴說嗎？滖吧，一個閃爍！你這醜惡的眼涙，不要再給我以羞辱吧！</p>
<p>呵！我給你說：你眞可以不必再來攪擾我了。你看：夜正長，夢也漫漫！長此以往，我何日得行完我此艱險之征途。呵，請你僥恕我，眞正不要再來攪擾我了！你聽：躺在我身邊的這條瘦狗，也正在夢裏發出沉長的哀號。讓我也去入夢吧！以前我曾說過：只有夢裏會有着我的安息的寗靜。然而，現在我知道，連夢裏也没有安息和寗靜的時候。可是，却也不能讓自己不去入夢。正如愁來了，酒雖不能澆愁，却也不能不去喝酒一樣。</p>
<p>呵，憤怒長哼的寒風，你也請息些兒吧！讓我安靜一刻兒，僅僅一刻兒也好。現在，趁着近旁這工廠之巨輪已經停止了震動。讓我在這難得的時候，好好在安睡一覺，俾得恢復一些子疲勞。等待天一微明，我就要抓起身來，爲他人作牛馬之勞働。我給你說：我是不甘願看那矮醜的怪物，向我射出那催促的獰笑之眼光。</p>
<h3>彌敦道上</h3>
<p>— 黎埃</p>
<p>梧桐葉上吹着秋的調子。</p>
<p>香江，染了濃厚的秋的顔色。</p>
<p>從醫院裏出來，覺得一切都是陌生的。夢醒了似地丨糿滅的悲哀！</p>
<p>懹着倦了的心，獨個兒在彌敦道上走着。</p>
<p>洋槐蒼老了，蒼老地矗立在柏油道上；秋的夕陽，像憂　的珠兒，瞧着禮拜堂的頂尖上，工廠的烟囱上，蒼老的洋槐上；柏油道上漾着紫色的老波；英國水兵挺直胳脯兒，神氣地走着，吹着口笛，吹着［雷夢娜］的調子，西班牙小姐在影院前等着丨七點一刻。黄包車夫的眼睛，餓狼似地，在黑的街頭。</p>
<p>蒼黄的街燈，在黄昏裏掙扎，紅的電流廣吿，在蒼老底洋槐下，盪着血的影……</p>
<p>夜的彌敦道是瘋狂的；自家底心裏是寂寞的。</p>
<p>從生活底尖端跌下了，爬起來，再掙扎，一次，二次，三次…疲倦了；爬不起來，生活的錘兒落在腦袋上，狼狽地起來，掙扎……丨這麽地不息着。</p>
<p>明天的現在，在輪上了，經過綠的海洋，到一個陌生的地方去。幾年來，希望　時光　去了，生活底篇愊裏，塗了灰色的陰影。往往那麽用力地去抓啦！抓到的是一缕青烟！</p>
<p>生的厭倦者喲！</p>
<p>［…南國，盪漾着熱閙的氣息，討厭的顔色已弄壤我們的瞳子了。快來吧，渡過海，這里有鮮的空氣…蔓，你應該確信：嚴冬的背後，有春的笑，這是［是力］的時代，這是搏鬥的年頭…］想着羅的來信，像乾了一杯白蘭地，我暗地裏感激他，這位鼓動我的朋友。</p>
<p>無論如何明天走了，雖然是病後；但爲了生活，爲了新的希望在誘惑。香江，在我生命史中是一頁血的印象，永不能磨滅的印象，但明天的現在將變成了過去，永遠的過去。</p>
<p>提了腦袋：夕陽給黑夜埋没了。燈光把自己的影子寫在彌敦道上，模糊地；瞧着自己模糊的影子…</p>
<p>一幅黑影閃過丨</p>
<p>［蔓，哦！你丨二隻手抓信住了。</p>
<p>駭了一跳。</p>
<p>蓬亂的髮下，閃着二顆黑而大的凹眼睛，直的鼻子，闊嘴，粗的鬍子，襯着一張日字形的瘦臉。</p>
<p>我駭異地瞧了一會，說不出話來。</p>
<p>［你忘記了？我丨老鐵。］</p>
<p>［噢］，像錘子落在腦袋上，幾乎昏下去！我决不會想到老鐵會變成這個樣子！</p>
<p>我們談了過去，現在，未來…我們低了腦袋，默默地瞧着我們模糊的影子……</p>
<p>五年前，我們都是青年，我們有一個同樣的理想，同樣的期待明天。</p>
<p>我默默地想着各人不同的遭遇…</p>
<p>［遇蔓，不能多談了］。他瞧瞧時錶：［錶八點鐘了，我要趕夜船回家去。］他發狂地跑了，我追上抓着他：</p>
<p>［你還要回家？］家</p>
<p>［噢，要我去什麽地方去？］凹眼睛裏閃着火：［没有親戚，没有朋友丨丨我要找我的母親去，哦！母親一生的幸福給我摧殘了。最後，我願爲她而毁滅自己…蔓，恕我吧，我是慚愧的，什麽我都了解，但我却不能了解自己…］。每一句話，好像利刃地刺進自己的心；他是什麽時候跑了呢？自己不知道，忽忙提了腦袋，瞧：</p>

<h3>失樂園</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>中國人，猶其輓近的中國人，拈住［今非昔比］之類做題目，文章是很多的，雖然已成濫調，然而做起來文章一定還是很多的。我也是中國人，多多少少也免不了沾染這毛病。怎樣就有了這毛病呢？自何時起呢？自己實在很糊塗；有些講不出。假使你一定要問，我只好說從失去了樂園。話越說越奇了，我怎麽也好有樂園？這不過故意講得誇些吧了。我們說的樂園，不過是幼年時玩要的處所。這處所也許和天國的樂園相差很遠，因爲我至今還没有到天國的樂園去過，想像不出到底是怎麽一番樣子，以致將幼時玩要的地方視作樂園了的。</p>
<p>然而那樂園在不知間失去了，又因爲我没有像天國那樣的樂園，所以老懷想着那塊地方。</p>
<p>鄉下人一生到頭娛樂的時候很少，至少是我祖居的某地是那樣，端午不喝雄黄酒。仲秋不賞月。舊歷七月十五日逢［鬼節］，城市裏是要放河燈的，可是這是鄉下，没有什麽［會］什麽［社］之類組織，更没有河，除却上墳照例燒化紙錢外，與平日無異。只有上元節，孩子們得到一隻花紙糊的燈籠已喜出望外，間或有人肯破費賣兩筒小號［花子］放放，筒直要動員全村上下了。玩龍燈大放烟火諸事，連老人也未嘗說起有過的。這村子是那麽小，又那麽窮，從不曾有大件値得記述。也一年到頭都被寗靜的空氣包圍着，情况只有寥落同寂寞可以形容。</p>
<p>然而孩子們和别村上的也毫無差别，總不肯讓寂寞重重壓在身上，讓時光白白逝去。孩子們决不干於坐在大人身傍，聽他們講糧米油鹽行價，某擧人軼事，或鬼怪行傳，那些都是毫無意味的廢話，同孩子的心不相關屬。孩子們有着自己的世界，那就是禾塲上。每當秋後，塲上已收拾得乾乾凈凈，月亮照着光光坦坦的塲面，晚飯後就熱閙起來了。這是孩子們的樂園。</p>
<p>雖然只是毫無什麽虚實變幻的塲，然而一被孩子們佔領，就决不會再是簡單的了。他們可以翻出許多花樣，其中有一種呌做［老鼈晒蓋］，是要四個人前後左右四角站正，一個人上去，脚蹬住後兩人的肩膀，手抓住前兩人的肩膀，一氣向前跑去的，有些類似疊羅漢。還有一種呌做［老鼠鑽圈］的，還有多種是擺起鎭勢，雙方一問一答，然後以力量的盛衰决勝負的。大祇各地都有相同的游戲，只是名稱或各有不同，因爲並非作考證，也不再一一舉列。這些遊戲大都非常幼稚，變化也很簡單，可是鄉兒是眞心玩着，嘩笑吵閙之聲往往驚起寒林中的睡鴉。</p>
<h3>蒼蠅（七）</h3>
<p>— 意pｉｒａｎｄｃｌｌｏ作席滌塵譯</p>
<p>［我們是將在同一天結婚的……！］</p>
<p>［不要怕，我們將一淘結婚！］耐利一邊說道，一邊托起那緊裏頭頸的手。</p>
<p>同時，醫生一徑望着那垂死的人，很清楚，這是炭疸熱。</p>
<p>［對我說你也記得有蟲叮過你嗎？］嗎</p>
<p>［没有叮過，］柴魯摇頭來示意。</p>
<p>［蟲？］蟲薩羅問道。</p>
<p>醫生盡其所能的對兩個農人解釋這個病。一定是附有什麽牲口死於炭疸熱。誰知道有多少的蟲，許是飛集在那丢棄谷底的臭屍上面，一定内中有一隻後來飛來飛去，將這個病接到躺在馬棚裏的柴魯身上了。</p>
<p>當醫生這麽說着，柴魯把臉轉向墻去。</p>
<p>没有人知道牠，可是死亡也就在那裏；牠是這麽小，所以就使有什麽人想到來找它，也簡直窺察不到它。</p>
<p>它是一隻蒼蠅，在那裏墻上，看來寂然不動，但一經仔細瞧去，就見牠一時將牠那小小吸嗍器官呼出又吸入，一時敏捷地洗洗地的兩隻細細的前腿，互相搓搓，仿佛滿意了。</p>
<p>柴魯注意到，對牠緊緊睜望着。</p>
<p>一隻蒼蠅丨</p>
<p>也許就是這一隻，也許是别一隻。誰知道？現在聽得醫生說起，他好像也記起來。不錯，當他昨天在這裏横下身來，等他表兄弟們剝完洛帕的杏仁的時候，曾經有隻蒼蠅煩擾過他。會得就是這一隻嗎？</p>
<p>他見牠突然飛了起來，他也就拿眼睛一道追隨着牠。</p>

<p>糧食粉銷見繁標準上升</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈一致穏定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角左右、坎拿大好八分至一角零不等、當開價時、以洋麥之報好、兼之目下賣銷、頗見活動、聞津帮方面、因平綏一帶、去路頗繁、故標準抽動、甚見熱閙、因此開價之局面、已見穏固、至遠期因浮空抵補廠出無多、故喊價甚穏、較之前日收價、計漲一分至一分半不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因現銷活絡關係、市見平穏、遠期初亦挺健、旋因買氣轉寂、回跌分外、據業中人觀察、近期因實銷尙好、恐難過落矣、結果本月份漲七釐半、二月份好一分、三月份好二分二釐半、四月份好一分半、五月份好一分、六月份好半分、</p>
<p>期麥漲後轉平落</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、呈先漲後跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角左右、坎拿大好八分至一角不等、當開價時、以市塲買户頗盛、賣户見稀、故嘁價即暗提三四分、三月份因買户爭進、竟横跳八分之巨、惟各盤交易、則未見大暢也、迨至下午開盤、初仍堅定、旋以粉市略軟、出户驟湧、各盤交易、亦暢旺異常、至最後結果、本月份反跌四分、二月份跌三分、三月份微好一分、餘未開、現麥市面、以廠家互擯、仍無見交、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、星期一發表之可見供給、料必有大量之减少、價跌時現貨與期貨之需要似已呈進步、</p>

<p>河米平穏無特變</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源共到三十餘號、（貨共近六千石）銷塲仍屬不爽、形勢平淡、晚稻價悉無榮辱、僅各厚粳因到源較遜、續提角許、人心似已不若前之堅穏、目下市面、殊難斷言、專恃天時爲轉移耳、杜洋尖仍以乏貨無市、陰變元亦平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各埠到貨祇近十號、市銷方面、綠經售同業開會、致客方上市甚遲、銷胃淡呆、市形白粳早市挺立、午市轉平、羊尖提高殺次、去胃頗俏、續形加起二三角、餘貨均屬定勢、</p>
<p>洋客秈内地去化又活</p>
<p>期洋米續有大批成交</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况本居站勢、因邇日到頭不絶、前定又將逐步抵串、且洋商求售甚力、現洋米乃立小五分、期米以本街内地均有胃口、洋商雖有盡量出售、然以成本高昂、不肯低脫、故市價尙能平站、昨現貨開四千包、期貨則由雅利洋行售出四千八百噸、達孚出五百包、以遠期四五月份較多、</p>
<p>客秈以上游水淺、成本加高、到頭不湧、而昨日内地胃口甚香、且本街亦有應酬、天津問津客元、崇沙辦砶米、無錫辦新糙米、故市　甚俏、行情步砌二三分、全市開出湖南沙市各米六千五百包、</p>
<p>又訊、洋米午後略軟、近晚洋商續在求出、據云産價微降、故順全隆有近期四元八角二分之西貢五百　拋出、</p>
<p>寂寞之麩皮市</p>
<p>麩皮市况、日來沉靜異常、因洋莊不動、大廠存麩見積、因此人心寂寞不前、至小廠麩因内地去胃尙佳、市呈平穏、目前各檔麩價、均喊二元七角、尙少軒輊云、</p>
<p>糖市青糖開出萬餘件</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢平定、惟國産青糖成交突見增旺、蓋銷路已漸發動也、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨十八元七角半、不動、轉口關棧貨五元二角三分、好起三分、八九號荷赤現貨十三元九角、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元二角半、好起五分、本廠綿白一號十八元一角、號盤有廣帮開出片青四千餘箱、價爲九元、又條青五百餘　、九元三角、潮帮開出潮青六千餘包、價爲十元半至九元六角、因昨日寗波無錫等帮有大批動辦、而汕頭地價來電報升、故受乎踴躍、成交數頓見暢旺云、</p>

<p>南北貨青島生仁又升四角</p>
<p>生紅自申市回跌後、客貨以成本關係、均堅守少出、乃前昨兩日、青島地價　見活躍、步漲四角之多、故此間號盤愈形堅挺、昨市僅開出素　島仁三百包、由本街辦入、價升至七元五角、存數較多之徐州仁、仍堅守不售、觀厥趨勢、脚地甚硬、後市尙有續升之可能、</p>
<p>五金黑鐵皮到旺銷滯</p>
<p>黑鐵皮新近到貨十分衆多、故積存各洋棧之現貨、異常踴躍、惟銷路則十分閑散、雖向所暢銷之搪磁廠、近因年關迫近、各業均在結束期中、所以胃口大减、故市上除有少數買賣外、大宗生意一無足述、客帮交易、因天津帮莊客太半北旋、是以　無有問津者、烟　青島徐州各帮、亦祇有少許成交、是经出路大遜、人心市氣間趨鬆軟、故開價比前殊爲便宜、如二尺六尺每札售九元七角半、比前小去二角半、三尺六尺三張四張售九元、五張九元二角半、六張九元三角半、七張九元五角、八張九元六角、九張十張九元七角半、十一張以至十三張俱開十元零五角、較之上日行情、互有低落、竟有一二角之錯、據業中人云、此貨年内銷塲空無進步可言、苟欲發展、殊非至明春不可、</p>

<h3>不准女子賣弄風情</h3>
<p>— 無法</p>
<p>［顚不剩的了萬千，這般可喜娘罕曾見，我眼花撩亂口難言，魂靈兒飛去半天。］</p>
<p>這是西廂記驚艶一幕中，張君瑞初見鶯鶯和幾句話，我想其時鶯鶯孝服在身，並不十分扮得［嬌嬌滴滴的媚，］這位張君瑞先生一見之下，便神魂顚倒，如痴如狂，眞的張是一個色中的餓鬼，倘若崔鶯鶯厅裝艶服，搽脂抹粉，打扮得像跑棧房跑游戲塲幾位淌白小姐，不曉得張君瑞先生見了要怎樣［着魔］呢？不，這　種人張君瑞看了，一定掉頭不顧而去，决不發生以下種種事情，西廂記便做不下去。</p>
<p>我的腦筋也非常頑錮，氣量也十分狹窄，不像某處地方，家主婆作客或購物回來，没有人跟梢，黑漆板凳便大大地不高興，把家主婆看不起。從前我的黄撿老婆出去，雖没有什麽奇裝艶服，但必定搽些胭脂抹些粉，我便大不滿意，有一次家主婆出去，自然是照常辦理，我便在惱怒之下，去詰問了。［你平日在家，並不搽脂抹粉，你出去便要搽抹脂粉，是甚麽道下？倘你在家搽些脂粉，猶可說也，若你出去要搽脂粉，簡直是居心不可問了。］我的黄臉老婆被我詰責之下，實屬無話可答，便笑了一笑說道。［我出去弄得篷頭垢面，似乎不好意思，有什麽道理呢？以後出去，便也不施脂粉了。我璨在想想，我的見解和現代潮流，却是不對。但我的理論，自信却是不差。］</p>
<p>據某報平訊，［平市公安局奉市政府訓令，據市民陳少網呈略稱，近有一般女子，終日在各公共塲所，作誘惑青年之伎倆，請設法取締云云］的確，凡屬年青男子，正在性慾衝動之際，那裏還經得起千嬌百媚的女子來誘惑，但是據陳少網所稱，還是一般没有職業，而操淫業爲生涯的女子。或者名爲求學，而暗中賣弄青春的女子，這兩種女子，一種是經濟的壓迫，一種是性慾的要求。我想這兩種人，倘爲經濟壓迫，不得已而出於賣弄風情的一途，尙有可原之處。至於學界之中，亦說形同暗娼，必定是極少數的不良份子，决不昌普遍的現像，</p>
<p>但我深察社會之中，艶裝奇服，賣弄風情的到並不限於以上兩種人物。無論大家小户，無論奶奶小姐，賣弄風騒，我雖不敢說，但奇裝艶服，吸引觀衆，很有可靠的憑證。試問她們的心理，是怎樣的心理？我也不敢妄加估量，卽以物質方面言之，損失至不可計數。胭脂花粉指紅等類不必說，卽以衣服而論，必定半年一换，上半年行長的，下半年又行短的，下半年行大的，上半年又行小的，現在行什麽綢做什麽綢，再半年又吀什麽綢做什麽綢。請問這篇帳從何算起。</p>
<p>或者說，小姐這樣，耶穌還有道理，而奶奶如此，其目的安在？據明白婦女心理者云，男子每喜歡拈花惹草，招蜂引蝶的女子，她們爲抵制劣貨起見，所以也用一種花枝招展的手段，來籠絡丈夫，這些話是否確實，我至今還有些懷疑。</p>
<h3>酒與女人</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>酒，在朱老三的肚子裏發着火樣的熱氣，臉孔漲得通紅的，神經都錯亂了，在他的記憶裏，在他那胃着火的赤色眼睛中，只有那女人，那居住在二樓的女人。</p>
<p>瘋狂的，他自言自語的呌着駡着，一下子他哭了，但當在哭得狠厲害的時候，他突然又笑了，他望着坐在他面前的人講故事，他又對着坐在面前的人駡，雖然當在他閙得太厲害時，那站在木栅外的看守會不耐煩的開了門，把那手裏的竹鞭，用出狠大的力去打在他身上，口裏狠毒的駡着他。但這在他，滿口吐出着酒的氣味的朱老三，似乎並不覺得，不知道在他的面前站着一位破口大駡的兇神，在他身上揮動着粗大的竹鞭，在他手和足上銬着鐵的圏子，在他四週盡是粗大的木棡，一节加在他身上的不自由和痛苦，他都不知道，他還是那樣繼續的呌着，駡着，笑着，哭着，在他腦子裏，毫不知道這裏是一個絶對没有自由的地方，絶對没有一個人是可以得到自由，他的那樣嘈閙，是一個失了自由的人所没有的。</p>
<p>時候已到了黄昏，天空一片的沉黑，木栅裏的人們，臉對臉都看不大清楚的糢糊了。站在栅門外的看守者，也狠不耐煩似的揮動着手裏的竹鞭子，踏着沉重的步代在徘徊，皮鞋聲鏗鏗地在響着。</p>
<p>一百隻，二百隻的眼珠，在那木栅旁熌動着，這些熌動着的眼珠，狠自然地，都集中在那來回走動着的看守者身上，似乎是在吿訴他說：［時候不早了，我們還都空着肚子呢？］但是，這都没有用，那徘徊而吸着紙烟的看守者，似乎一點都没有看到，只是不時的伸手在袋子裏摸出時錶，在看看到底换班的時候到了没有。對於這些集中在他身上的飢餓的眼珠，他一點也不注意到的。</p>
<p>朱老三這時覺得腦袋有千斤的重量，　昏沉地，眼前在發黑，什麽也不知道的躺在地板上，那堅硬的地板上，就這末樣的睡着了。</p>
<p>北風颯颯地從那木栅外吹進來，朱老三覺得週身一陣冷，從那沉醉的夢裏醒轉來。當他睜開了兩眼的時候，他狠奇怪又狠驚怕，這亯到底是一個什麽地方，到底他爲什麽到這裏來躺在地板上睡？</p>
<p>他的神經漸漸地清楚了，他的眼睛不住的在昏黄的燈光下瞧着四週。他狠清楚地記得，他今天的中午還在館子裏吃菜和喝酒，爲什麽呢？他今晚會躺到這裏來，這明明的不是他所要來的地方呀？</p>
<p>朱老三這時想站起來，但他發覺了，他的手，他的足，都銬上了鐵的圈子，他心裏明白了，他一定犯了什黀罪了。這時的他，只有呆坐着想，追憶着今天午飯後的事情。</p>
<p>在午後的時候，朱老三吃過了中飯，從着館子裏走回家裏去，他酒喝得多了，跑起路來總是東倒西歪的，到了家裏，他自己也不知是爲了什麽，就跑上二樓那王家嫂子房裏去了，他發　狂似的，他去抱她，去撫摸她，去丨丨可是，那王家嫂子呌起來了。他就糢糢糊糊地給房門外闖進來的人抓住了，從此之後，他就不知一切了。</p>
<p>朱老三很費力的再去追想，但總是想不起來，到底給人家抓住後還是怎麽樣呢？他想着，他看看自己的衣服上，他這時發覺了，發覺了他的衣服是給扯破了，那背上和腿上，隠隠地有點兒痛，他才開始的明白他今天的這一回事，爲的只是酒和女人。</p>
<p>夜的陰森的異影深深地印在木栅外的地上，一點光也没有，只有那刺骨的風在吹着，在向着木栅裏的人們送着冷氣。那樣漆黑的天，看看是快要下雨了。朱老三這時沉入在追憶裏去了。</p>
<h3>二黄漫畫展</h3>
<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>漫畫，近來在中國，的確在風行起來，而在繪畫藝術中，漫畫的確也佔有相當的地位；而且，漫畫的力量，也許比一般的圖畫大過一些，它能够諷刺社會，能够啟發思想，一切的一切，也許是那種純爲鑒賞的圖畫所不及的。</p>
<p>爲了漫畫的本身，具有一種幽默的情調，而自有一般的人，當做它是舞臺上的丑角，被忽略過了，其實一幅漫畫，正有一種使你哭，笑，感傷，同情的潛勢力呢！因此，我覺得漫畫展在上海，雖還是第一回舉行，而値得去參觀一下的。</p>
<p>踏上了大陸商塲的四樓，出電梯轉一個灣，便是漫畫展覧的第一室，完全是黄士英的作品，一共六十四幅，四面的牆壁上，掛得琳琅滿目，眞所謂美不勝收呢！</p>
<p>漫畫　，我們承認，正和報紙一樣是一面反照社會的鏡子。在中國這樣破碎不全的社會之中，漫畫所映出來的社會，當然也是破碎的，漫畫作家對於社會，更當然是不滿的。因此我們在六十四幅作品之中，右以找出很多是反映社會的破碎不全的情狀的。</p>
<p>［挺而走險］，［枵腹從耕］，［貧者的命］，［飢餓的騒動］，［失業］，［流民］，［生活的呼號］，［災區巡視］，［啼飢號寒］，那些作品，不是寫出中國的農村破産，都市不景氣嗎？［大地主的巡禮］，［大家庭的没落］，［私生子］，［鴇母鞭］，［發現一個女人的照片］，飽暖後］，幾幅作品，也已把中國的現　社會，舊禮敎，種種矛盾，寫了出來。［殖民地的怒潮］，［被　壓迫民族的吼聲［，寫出帝國主義鐵蹄下的被壓迫民的苦痛，而我們看了［長城之夜］，會聯想到東北的失地，看了［浪人］，會聯想到一二八時期上海日浪人的活動形態，在這裏，已很够使我們體騐到在這些作品中的潛力是如何。作者更運用他的靈敏的思想，幽默的筆法，對於社會國家，極盡諷刺指導的能事。</p>
<p>到第二室，在這裏，七十四幅漫畫，完全是黄鼎的出品。在黄鼎的作品中，當然也不致例外，有好多是曝露中國社會形態的破碎不全的。像［逃債人受難］，［索債］，［房東來了］，［吃飯難］，［饑餓的人們在窗外呐喊着］，［鄉下人上當］等，把農村都市的破産情形和不景氣象更全部托出。另外全部作品之中，速寫有十八點之多，所街景，風景，和人像爲主題。此外［帝國主義在中</p>
<p>［租界組合綫］等，更是有力的唤起民族精神的幾幅漫畫。</p>
<p>綜觀黄士英黄鼎兩君的漫畫，構圖與用筆，都各自一派，而所所有的作品，技巧和内容，都够得上稱爲在水凖以上，最後希望由這一次的漫畫展，喊起全國漫畫家的注意。</p>
<h3>停當待贖</h3>
<p>— 牢城</p>
<p>在讀書的時候，是絲毫不明白當舖這一回事。但近年來上海市内林立着的當舖，却是十分熟識了。因爲自己和一般窮朋友上當舖的次數日在日多，看到社會上失業窮困的人們一天天的多，我以爲大約當舖的生意該吏好些吧。但近</p>
<h3>看報的印象</h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<p>更正：昨日揰畫漏排畫題［從新做起］</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>日來總看過了好幾家舖當的門邊，現出紅紙黑字，特别使人醒目的：［停當待贖］。而且多是很大而很有名的當舖，不覺使人起了疑　，間問更内行的朋友，他却笑我少見多怪，豈止如此情形。有一次幾乎全部關門大吉哩！這更加使我愕然。原因是上當舖的人實在是多而又多，可是當而不贖，就是當舖的致命傷了。于是乎不能不［停當待贖］，道理便算在此。當舖雖然是歡喜當的人多些，生意熱閙點兒，可是他們主要是在求高利。當十塊錢的東西，只需六個月，他便要我一塊錢利息。如果當了能贖，這種生意經是便可興隆的啦。不能去贖出來，老擱置做存貨，老板的資本便不能流通。如果當期已滿，無人去贖，那麽舊貨在現在這種普遍的不景氣裏面，和物價日更低落的現象中，上頂没有出路了。</p>
<p>我們從這個小現象裏，就可以更明顯看出！人們的貧窮是日更深入化了。特别是大都市的榮華中，更呈露出牠的　伏着的危機。現在什麽東西都因當舖業的［停當待贖］的衰落，而當不價錢依仍上當的人還是更加多，但多當少錢而就没有力量贖出，其更貧苦的情况，可想見了吧？不然，就斷不至於願意犠牲價高的物，不願以廉價的錢去購出來。</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（二）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（二）史丹福的聯綴影片的攝製</p>
<p>在多少年以前，有一位葛雷菲士（Ｄ·Ｗ·ｒｉｆｆｉｔｈ），他本來是歌舞雜耍戲裏的一個演員，他忽然在紐約設立了一個極簡陋的小攝影塲，開始拍攝活動影片。他製造的速度着實可驚，大約每一星期，可以出一張影片。後來他又跑到紐吉西，拍了許多曠野的西部影片。因爲他没有許多錢，僱用多數的臨時演員，所以他用的演員，在一張片子裏總要扮演着好幾個角色，一天用過三四回才算數。因此，印度紅人被牧牛人所攻撃的，往往就是扮演牧牛人所扮演的，而坐在野火前面，祇看見背影的紅女人，也許就是葛雷菲士自己的老婆，或是他老婆的朋友。</p>
<p>那個時候的葛雷菲士，那裏知道他的天才到後來會名聞天下，在這種像（ＢｉｒｔｈｏｆａＮａｔｉｏｎ）等鉅製裏，輝映全球呢？他怎能料到，他所僱用的那個女郎，赚三塊錢一天的工錢的後來居然成了［美國的甜心］，而是現在好萊塢社交領袖，曼麗璧克馥呢？曼麗璧克馥有一天，帶領了兩個驚疑不定的女孩子到攝影塲，請葛雷菲士亦給她們一些事做。當時葛雷菲士亦没有料到，其中的一個後來竟成了一代最偉大的電影　演員，［二孤女］等名片中的主角，李蓮吉舒（ＬｉｉｉａｎＧｉｓｂ）。在那時葛雷菲士的眼光看來，他亦看不出曼麗璧克馥，李蓮吉舒，偉大的地方在那裏。當着她們，不過是些活潑好動的女郎而已。</p>
<p>再論到葛雷菲士以前的事續，我們可以提到一位李蘭史丹福（ＬｅｌａｎｄＳｔａｎｆｏｒｄ）。他於無意之中奠定了美國六大企業之一的基礎，但是他却没有知道。他在一天晚上宴會之後，他提起了一個理論，說是一匹馬在馳騁極速的時候，他的四蹄是同時離開地面的。這句話在現代的我們看起來，並没有什麽希奇，因爲我們在運動影片裏，或是戰事影片裏，已經看得很多了。但是在那時，却就有一位在座的賓客不相信他的理論。於是史丹福就和那人爭論起來。二人各不相下，他們終於賭了一個東道。史丹福要想證明他的理論是對的，好贏得那個東道，道在不知不覺之中，竟造成了活動影片的開始。</p>
<p>史丹福是一個富有的人。他亦是一位善於騎術的運動家。他旣和朋友打了賭，就費盡心思，想贏取那個東道。他想用攝影的方法，來證實他的理想，可是他拍了多年的照相，結果都不很滿意。最後他遇見了一個攝影家，名字叫約翰伊蕯克（ＪｏｈｎＤ·Ｉｓａａｃｒ），他替他出了一個主麕，那個主意可以證實他的理論，但亦可以指明他理論是錯誤的。他叫史丹福用好幾十架攝影機，排列着放置在地上，另外用一種雷力的構造，使快馬走過鏡箱前面的時候，許多鏡箱挨次地展開鏡蓋，將地面上的眞實情形一一攝入。這個試駖的結果，就是一排的聯綴照相，而馬蹄各種不同的位置，亦就瞭如指掌了。</p>
<p>史丹福審視着一張一張的照片，知道他的理論是對的，他拿給他的朋友看了，收到了一筆賭欵。在一八八二年，他就刊了一本書，論到這件事的始末，而印書的錢，亦就是那筆贏來的賭欵。過此以後，他一切就忘懹了。但是這些照相，就是第一次動作的照片，第一次照片表現一個東西的動作的。要是没有他那一次的打賭，亦許現在我們還看不到克拉克蓋博，或瑪琳黛德麗許哩。這不是很奇怪的一種工業掌故嗎？當然，史丹福並没有知道，他已發明了一種新的東西，是自從他的書刊出之後，許多發明家的腦筋，亦就被他的試騐推動，而開始急劇的工作起來。他們覺得許多鏡箱連綴的攝影法是不够的。他們就開始想用一隻鏡箱，連續的攝若干張影片。在這個時候，大發明家艾迪生亦就對於這件事，感覺到異様的興趣。（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評［大路］</h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>工人的生活是痛苦的，是枯燥的，［大路］的作者以兩位少女來調濟他們的生活，鼓勵他們，使他們忘去了工作的辛苦，使他們精神活躍起來，這實在是很理想的。但詩人的理想總是美麗的，這裏的每一個塲面，每一個鏡頭，都充滿着詩的情調與畫的感情，詩與畫織成了畫面。</p>
<p>劇調起始的前半部是輕鬆的，以後隨着故事的進展而漸漸地緊張起來，直到金哥他們被囚打時，畫面上和音響上空氣的都很緊促，壓迫，這在效果上，確是獲得了成功的。</p>
<p>作者對於每一個人物個性的劃分明晰，也是不能忽視的。金哥的聰明勇敢，老張的沈默多疑，章大的魯莽粗直，小六子的懦弱無能，鄭君的智識階級風味，處處表現得恰如其份，絶無矛盾與過火之處。按照着劇情弛緩所配的音樂，非常適當與調和，這也帮助了不少劇的感動力。</p>
<h3>［大路］我評</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>［大路］的題材和意義，他表示了我國目下從事建設的重要性，並顯現着羣衆圑結力量的偉大。雖然，在帝國主義與惡勢力的交相壓迫下，以重重障礙去阻撓大路的工作，但終於因了羣衆們自身的努力，把堅强奮鬥的精神，不屈不撓的勇氣，去克服了而獲到最後的成功</p>
<p>不過，我覺得很有尙待討論的餘地，就是這是否係正確的現實？像路工們的拒絶賄賂，甘受拷打，那種從容就義的態度，和黎莉莉陳燕燕於使用美人計時候的機警勇敢，這是不是世界上眞有的事實？使人有些懹疑。</p>
<p>我們在本片中。聽到［開路先鋒］和［大路］這二支悲壯熱烈的歌曲，把内在的熱血，完全地熾沸起來。明快，歡欣，一切都是朝氣的表現，作雖僅有熱誠的殷勤的期望，而還没有切實去希求未來的光明，可是，他的精神却是够足讚美的了。</p>
<p>「風流寡婦」中的琴妮麥唐納和希佛萊（今日為該片放映最後之一日）</p>
<h3>［大路］觀後感</h3>
<p>— 喻比</p>
<p>我覺得［大路］是一部自始至終含有興奮意識的片子。</p>
<p>導演的努力乎　，在任何一個畫面上都照得出，輕快而有力，如丁香一面以乎揉粉，和她的足部移動以合着［大路歌］的拍子。又如韓小六子偷牛肉被捕時的一幕，茉莉以玉蜀黍之鬚裝在嘴上，以及丁香，茉莉兩人的活潑等。激烈處如路工被工頭的毒打，金哥的工頭衝突，丁香茉莉之施用美人計，酒醉胡夫，金哥以地上之利剪割斷繩索，用足趾取剪刀等，這都是導演在全片中最緊張而最聰明的地方，幾支歌曲的歌詞也帮助了全片不少的精彩。</p>
<p>導演有幾處的手法好像是採用［漁光曲］，如歌曲中的詞句，以畫面中的情調來演出，這［大路歌］［開路先鋒］［鳳陽歌］和［漁光曲］有些相似。導演把全片處置得很輕快，緊張，而甚發噱。不過導演處置幾個臨時演員在演出上却不甚有力。</p>
<p>演員如張翼飾的沉默剛毅，金燄的嘻笑，以及韓蘭根的玩趣，都很成功。陳燕燕確使人憐愛，可是在末一段去報吿時，走路欠緊接，面部也缺乏緊張的表情。尙冠武，章志直頗佳。鄭君里稱職，其餘演員亦頗努力。</p>
<p>配音甚佳。攝影清淅。</p>
<h3>［再生花］的瑣事</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>△…胡蝶大［再生花］中，一人而兼飾兩角：大寳是一個可憐的貧婦，二寳是一個貴族的太太。這一貧一富的相反的表情，胡蝶是做到了爐火純青的地步。而表情中最難演的要算是由苦臉轉到了笑臉，笑臉又轉到了苦臉，這在攝製［再生花］時，是常常見到的。</p>
<p>△…宣景琳在［再生花］中，要算是最努力的一個，這老媽媽平時坐在攝影塲裏，她什麽也不關心到塲内的喧閙，好像是坐在另一個世界似的，不時地和導演鄭正秋低聲絮語着每個鏡頭的表情，她這樣地用功，難怪要被廣大的觀衆所稱讚了。</p>
<p>△…爲了［再生花］的劇情更逼起見，鄭小秋和梅熹曾被軍閥的皮鞭，抽得全身發紫，而這犠牲顯然地是有着莫大的收穫，和偉大的價値，不是嗎？［再生花］中最能打動觀衆心絃的，要算是這個鏡頭了。</p>
<p>▲…看過［姊妹花］的觀衆們，想都知道二寳（胡蝶飾）在未嫁錢大帥以前，便有了一個情人，那情人是一個思想前進的革命青年，在［再生花］中它墏吿訴你這青年的一生。</p>
<p>▲…［姊妹花］中，大寳因打死錢大帥的妹妹，而被捕入獄了，次日，大寳的母親親往探監，得悉獄官趙得即係趙大，太太劍英即係二寳，結果二寳激於大倫，强把大寳携了出獄，此仍是［姊妹花］的劇情，其後如何，請看現在公映的［再生花］（却）</p>

<h3>警吏乘龍（White　Lies）（四）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>奥立佛點點頭，表示他可以接那電話。密契爾於是將電話筒抓了起來。祇聽見他的秘書的聲音說道：［泰萊隊長在外面要見你。］密契爾聽了，一時記不起泰利是誰，他想了一想，才記起來，就是那大膽的警察，現在升了隊長了。他來得正好，他不覺精神爲之一振。他於是裝作若無其事似的道：［呌他等着。我忙得很。我要見他的時候，我掀電鈴好了。］說完了，就將電話筒掛上了。奥立佛喊道：［手放在桌子上，不然我就開槍了。］他們於是大家相對楞着。一回兒，密契爾指着他檯上的香烟盒子，問奥立佛吸烟不吸。正在奥立佛的注意，偶然不提防的時候，密契爾輕輕抬起一隻腿來，將膝蓋頂着桌子下面的電鈴。一秒鐘以後，一個全副武裝的少年警官跳了進來，他身材魁梧，肩膀闊大，眼睛奕有神。瓊看了，不覺爲之怦然心動，原來這就是泰萊康登。奥立佛看見一個警官跑了進來，頓時侷促不安起來。但是康登却很自在的對着他道：［還是放下那支槍吧。這不是你要罪上加罪嗎？］他說着，一隻手搭上奥立佛執着槍的手，毫不費力地將他的槍搶下來了。奥立佛無可奈何地倒在椅子裏，慘然地哭了起來。</p>
<p>這個時候，密契爾忽然將他們忘記了，他突然恢復了凶新聞記者的本來面目。他大聲地喊着：［亨德！羅伯資！打電話到印刷房！呌他們停止工作！呌他們將封面拆下來，重新换過一個！［編輯室中殺人未遂！］這就是本年份最大的新聞！］報館的全部，立即瘋狂似的忙亂起來。瓊於大家忙亂之中，芳心脈脈看着康登說道：［你不要怪爸爸。他是常常這樣的。］密契爾心焉不在似的對着康登道：［眞有你的。眞痛快。請你有空來看看我，或者我不至於這麽忙法。你應當知道今天的事，是再好没有的新聞了。］他一面說着，一面就伸手去抓電話。瓊趁勢說道：［我想，爸爸，我們至少應當請康登隊長吃一頓晚飯。］那康登聽了，高興起來，將一頂帽子，不停地在乎裏旋轉着。密契爾道：［當然。當然。你去辦吧。］瓊於是對着康登道：［好嗎，隊長？明天晚上好不好？］康登握了瓊伸給他的　手，答應了一聲：［明天晚上。］瓊又叮囑一聲：［七點鐘。不用穿禮服。］康登就向大家吿别退出去了。</p>
<p>到了明天晚上，康登跑到密契爾鄉下的别墅裏赴瓊的約。但是他到了那裏，覺得極不自在。他的來吃晚飯，原想借此機會，來和瓊接近接近的。但是那天請的，不是他一個人，還有許多别的男客，都是他所不認識的。他在吃飯的時候，很少看見瓊。後來密契爾一定還要將他介紹給大衆，稱她是他編輯室裏的英雄。這下子一來，更使他忸怩不安了。後來他又看見瓊和亞塞爾勃蘭特利談話，他們談話的聲音極低，態度是極親暱，他並且聽說他們已經訂過婚了。這一來，更使他感覺到索然寡歡了。他忽然覺悟到，他無庸儘着在這個地方留連。這不是他的份位，一個警察混在一班纨袴子弟當中。從頭起，他就應當謝了不來。他想還是先到花園裏去散一回步，吸一支香烟，然後向主人吿别回去。花園裏特别的清幽，康登獨自在其中散着步。他自己笑着自己，怎樣騰空就去拘捕密契爾，竟在他的生活上，起了這樣一個小小的風波。他正想着，忽然聽見後面起了一陳悉率之聲，繼着在他肩膀上，加增一些和月光似的重量，跟着一種嬌滴滴的聲音說道：［你怎麽啦？］晚上總躱避着我？］（未完）</p>

<h3>近年來國貨建築材料之進展（上）</h3>
<p>— 薛次莘</p>
<p>自黄帝作宫室，開建築之濫觴，至周而建築之規模粗具，降至漢唐宋明，在建築上代有進展。當時因建築物之用途不繁，大都限於宫殿廟宇，及家屋之類，故所用材料，多取材於磚石木料；不若今日之戲院舞廳，公寓廠棧等建築，或求實用，或尙美觀，非利用各種材料，不足以適合需要。故當時之建築材料，取之宇内，已能足用，不假外求。海禁旣開，歐美之建築方法，輸入吾國；於是在搆造方面，則有鋼架工程與鋼骨水泥之建築，在裝璜方面，則有大理石之護壁馬賽克及花式木條之地板等，他如門鎖鉸鏈，玻璃油漆，無惟外貨是頼。雖小至一釘之微，亦不能全恃國貨之供給。都會中之崇樓大厦無論矣，卽窮鄉僻壤，其有無外貨建築材料之踪跡者，亦幾如鳳毛麟角。觀乎此，則吾人對於國貨建築材料之如何改進，如何提倡，應急起直追也明矣。近年提倡國貨之聲遍全國，雖在重工業方面，因經濟人材種種關係，不能有相當之成績；然國貨實用品之進展，頗有扶摇直上之勢。風聲所播，國貨建築材料，其已有者己日見改良，未有者亦漸次仿造或試辦。雖不能一時盡驅外貨於市塲之外，亦足以代之而有餘。苟國人對於此項工業，能加以愛護，對於所製材料，加以提倡，則國貨建築材料之前途，豈有限量哉。今國貨建築材料之種類，亦已不少，考擇其改良或舉辦已有成績者論列之。</p>
<p>（一）磚瓦　製造磚瓦，在昔多用土窰，於農隙時用木殼製坯，置土窰中燒之。以此各地磚瓦之尺寸，不能一律，其質料亦參差不一。加以工人散於農間，燒窰墨守成法，貨料遂日見退步。經營工業者，以其利微，多不注意於此。迨民初交易所全盛時代，建築隨之大興，於是此項工業，乃爲社會注意。始有較大規模磚瓦公司之組織，改用新式磚窰，製坯亦有改用鐵模者。故近年來磚瓦已漸見改進，尤以磚坯之日見加厚，與長度之漸次加多至十時爲可喜。瓦之製法及烘燒，亦見進步，而售瓦用瓦之人，亦漸知以瓦片吸不多少爲選擇瓦片之標準。更可見吾國建築界，近亦漸趨於科學化矣。</p>
<p>在昔土窰，並不製造空心磚與火磚。近年房屋高度日增，减輕磚之重量，遂爲迫切之需要。空心磚之用途，遂日增。工廠旣多，各種鍋爐及烟囱，在在均需用高熱度之火磚，而製造火磚者亦漸見增多，亦能合工業上應用之熱度。而磚瓦業中近年最大之貢獻，首推面磚之創製。面磚之製造，一方須有高熱度之磚窰，燒成堅實之磚料，一方須有美觀之磚面。而現在國貨面磚，均能合此條件，因有此國貨新材料之貢獻，在建築術上，遂增色不少。</p>
<p>（二）水泥　吾國有水泥已久，在建築材料仿中製洋貨者，當以水泥爲先。其後上海及龍潭先後設立水泥廠。當時國人對於新出品之水泥，輒多懹疑其質料，終以試騐之結果，及試用之成績，並不亞於歐美水泥之標雀，信用旣堅，銷路遂日增。水泥運費甚貴，外貨來中國者，原不甚多，至此幾可驅舶來品於本國市塲之外。然日本出品，則始終未能使其絶跡。近困日本取傾銷政策，水泥價廉，銷路乃激增。至快燥水泥，在國外出品已多，吾國至近年始有之。水泥在建築，軍事，交通，及工業上，均佔極重要之位置，亦屬重工業之一。苟於製造上能長此保持現在之成績，除謀吾者濫施其傾銷政策外，則水泥銷路之前途，自未可限量。因水泥而製成之出品，如水泥花磚，水泥瓦，煤屑磚等，已日增月異。於建築上亦裨益非淺。</p>
<p>（三）瑪賽克磁磚及缸磚等　瑪賽克磁磚及缸磚，向無國貨。而新建築中之地板及浴室等之護墻，需要又殷。故其銷路並不爲小。近年設廠製造者漸多，雖其間因顔色尺寸等技術上之問題，幾經困難，如能完成。然現在國貨出品，已能與舶來品相頡頏。甚至經售商人，爲迎合社會心理，有以國貨充洋貨出售者。以後建築日趨繁華，瑪賽克磁磚與缸磚等之用途正多，苟能於選料配色上，多加研究，使出品亦趨美麗，則舶來品之絶跡市塲，可指日而待也。</p>
<p>（四）油漆　吾國本産漆及桐油，且年有出口。是則油漆本無須仰給於他人之理。然近今建築物踵事增華，戎需求於油漆之顔色光澤，有非吾國固有之油漆所能供給者。旣能供給，其價値亦較舶來油漆爲貴。因之外貨油漆，侵入吾國市塲，蓋以其使用便利，種類繁多，遂至無一建築中，不見舶來油漆之踪跡。幸近年國人有見於此，創辦油漆廠日見增多。雖其中原料不能盡去外貨，然究屬國人製造。質料亦日見進步，較之舶來品未見遜色。種類亦增，凡鋼鐵建築，橋樑船壳，門窗地板等所用之各種油漆，均能製造，以應市塲之需要。</p>

<h3>Northeast Postal Service Contract Signed</h3>
<p>—Valid for One Year—</p>
<p>Huang Zigu Departs for Yuguan Today</p>
<p>Staff Members Depart Separately</p>
<p>Post Office Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Group Establishment</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Huitong Transfer Bureau and the Hebei Postal Bureau concluded a contract for handling postal services. This morning at 10:00 AM at the Tianjin Postal Administration, it was signed by Cao Jianting, Director of the Hebei Postal Bureau, and Huang Zigu, Manager of the Transfer Bureau. The contract is valid for one year. Upon expiration, if both parties agree, it may be renewed. Huang Zigu is seeking a guarantor shop in Shanghai to handle postal transfer matters, and will comply with the eleven simplified items attached to the contract. Settlements between the two parties will occur at the end of each month, without direct financial relations. All account exchanges will be handled by the Transfer Bureau. Exchange remittances and parcel post services will commence on February 1st. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Zigu, Manager of the Huitong Transfer Bureau, and Yu Xianglin, are scheduled to depart by train at 11:50 AM on the 8th, accompanied by a group of personnel, for Shanhaiguan to establish the Transfer Bureau. All necessary documents and equipment for the bureau have been prepared in Tianjin and will be arranged by the 9th if possible. It can be completed and a sign hung out for work to begin on the morning of the 10th. The Hebei Postal Administration will send Hu Xinfa and Li Jingyang to supervise the establishment of the bureau according to the contract. Personnel from the Gubeikou branch of the Transfer Bureau will depart by train for Peiping tonight, and will take a long-distance bus from Peiping to Gubeikou on the morning of the 8th. The Shanhaiguan bureau will be located outside the South Gate, and the Gubeikou bureau inside the North Gate. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the commencement of postal service, the Japanese side has informally indicated that the Transfer Bureau may not transfer Chinese books and newspapers into the Northeast without their consent. Any that are transferred into the area without permission will be confiscated upon discovery. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Merchants and workers from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces in the Northeast remit approximately 15 million yuan annually to the interior. Since our blockade of postal services to the Northeast, remittances have mostly been handled by banks such as the Bank of Communications, resulting in exchange losses of about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan each year. Once internal and external postal services commence on February 1st, this loss of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan can be avoided. However, the puppet state intends to seize the opportunity to once again request to join the Universal Postal Union. Japan proposed the puppet state of Manchuria's joining the Postal Union to the Universal Postal Union Congress in 1934, but it was ignored. Later, on May 16th, the League of Nations Council abandoned part of its previous resolution, but the puppet state of Manchuria's joining the Postal Union cannot obtain the approval of the various League member states. It is reported that Japan and the puppet state are preparing to separately request each country to conclude postal agreements before the next congress of the Postal Union, and then submit a request to the Postal Union to allow its joining the Postal Union because the postal problem has been resolved. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Huitong Transfer Bureau is ready and will begin operations on the 8th. The Gubeikou branch can also be established on the 10th. One group of service staff left for Yuguan on the 6th, and the rest will depart tomorrow or the day after. The handling contract has been submitted to the ministry for review and will be signed soon.

<p>Sun Ke Leaves Peiping for the South</p>
<p>Attends Yu Xuezhong's Luncheon in Tianjin</p>
<p>Plans to Meet Han Fuqu and Feng in Shandong</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Returns to Peiping After Hosting Sun's Banquet</p>
<p>(Peiping) Sun Ke and his wife went to Tianjin this morning to attend Yu Xuezhong's luncheon. Yu came to Peiping yesterday to meet Sun, and they returned to Tianjin together. Sun said, "I came to Peiping for sightseeing this time and stayed for a week. I was very impressed. I originally planned to stay for a few more days, but Liang Chou sent a telegram urging me to meet in Shanghai, so I left Peiping early. I am going to Tianjin to attend Yu's luncheon and am scheduled to leave Tianjin southward at 10:00 PM tonight. I will get off the train when passing through Jinan because of a scheduled meeting with Han. If time permits when passing through Tai'an, I plan to climb the mountain to visit Feng. After arriving in Nanjing, I will go to Shanghai to meet Wang and return to Nanjing after the matter is completed to preside over the swearing-in ceremony of the new Legislative Yuan members on the 14th. I have no particular feelings about the situation in North China, but I hope that more efforts will be made to save the nation and survive." (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Ke and his wife arrived in Tianjin from Peiping this morning at 11:30 AM by the same train as Yu Xuezhong. The heads of the Hebei Provincial Government and the Tianjin Municipal Government all welcomed them at the station. After Sun and others got off at the old station, they rested at the Provincial Government with Yu. At 1:00 PM, Yu hosted a banquet in the auditorium of the Provincial Government, accompanied by the directors of the provincial departments and the mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Ting'e. In the afternoon, they visited the city streets. Sun took the Jinpu express train south at 6:00 PM, as he needed to return to Nanjing urgently. He stopped briefly in Jining to visit Feng Yuxiang on Mount Tai and consult on national affairs, stayed for half a day, and then returned south on the evening of the 8th. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Ke said that after meeting with Mr. Feng in Jining, he would return to Nanjing and then go to Shanghai to meet Wang Liangchou. He had no specific task for this trip to Peiping, except for giving a speech at the invitation of Chairman Huang, and the rest was just sightseeing and social engagements. Chairman Huang is going south to take office within the next few days. Before Wang Liangchou goes abroad, he will conveniently go to Hong Kong. The National Federation of Commerce and Industry has proposed that half of the Legislative Yuan members be elected by the people, but I have no comment to make. This can be decided after the constitution is promulgated. The morale of the people in the North is still good. If they can unite, they can turn weakness into strength. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yu Xuezhong went to Tianjin with Sun Ke this morning to host a luncheon. He will come to Peiping again tomorrow or the day after to visit the ambassadors and chargés d'affaires of various countries to extend New Year greetings. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong returned to Peiping this afternoon at 8:00 PM after Sun Ke left. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources in diplomatic circles, the major diplomatic issues in North China have largely come to an end. Huang Fu is scheduled to come to Nanjing after the 10th to take up the post of Minister of Interior. Huang will be delayed in Nanjing for some time. All affairs of the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee will be temporarily handled by dispatched personnel. When asked about Tang Youren, he replied that he had not yet received Huang's telegram regarding his departure date. As for who will temporarily replace Huang during his absence from the Political Reorganization Committee, it should be clear in a few days. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Ke arrived in Tianjin from Peiping at 11:00 AM on the 7th. After getting off the train, he went to the home of Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, to rest. In the afternoon, Chairman Yu hosted a banquet at the Beining Garden at 4:00 PM, and he left Tianjin southward at 6:00 PM in the evening. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke telegraphed the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan from Peiping on the morning of the 7th, stating that he had completed his affairs in Peiping and was scheduled to return south on the same day, arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th. It is reported that after arriving in Nanjing, Sun will rest briefly and then go to Shanghai to visit Wang Chonghui before returning to Nanjing to preside over the swearing-in ceremony of the fourth Legislative Yuan members.

<p>Holds Memorial Service for Shi</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) All the school board members, faculty, and students of Soochow University held a memorial service in the auditorium of the university at 9:30 AM on the 7th, as Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper, was one of the school's board members.

<p>Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi Arrives</p>
<p>Reportedly Regarding the War Zone Issue</p>
<p>Will Proceed According to Chaisan's Approach</p>
<p>Chaisan Bids Farewell in Peiping Yesterday to Return Home</p>
<p>(Peiping) Takahashi, the newly appointed Assistant Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, visited Military Attaché Suzuki in Shanghai some days ago and paid his respects to important party and state figures in Nanjing. After completing these matters, he went north and arrived in Peiping this morning. After getting off the train, he went to the Japanese Embassy to meet with the former Assistant Military Attaché Chaisan and scheduled to meet with Huang on the 9th. Chaisan will leave Peiping for Tanggu on the same day to return home to take up a new position attached to the General Staff Department. Takahashi said that regarding the war zone issue, after taking office, he would continue to deal with the issue with the same approach as Military Attaché Chaisan in the past. He has not received any new orders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Kwantung Army. He hopes that China and Japan can treat each other with sincerity, eliminate misunderstandings, and move towards a brighter path. He made the same statement when he visited important party and government figures of your country in Nanjing. The peace of East Asia depends on the joint responsibility of China and Japan to maintain it in order to be successful. The activities of Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone are a major issue, which is enough to affect the feelings between China and Japan, so he plans to investigate first and then jointly crack down on them. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Chaisan returns to Japan, he will be sent to various European countries for an inspection tour, which is expected to last for six months. In the future, after returning home, he will be reappointed and the statement that he will be transferred to the General Staff Department is inaccurate. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The new Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, Takahashi, passed through Tianjin this morning on the Peiping-Shenyang train to Peiping and will pay a visit to the Military Branch Association and Huang Fu and others at 9:00 AM on the 9th. The former Military Attaché Chaisan began to say goodbye to various agencies on the 7th and is scheduled to leave the pass on the Peiping-Shenyang train on the 9th, first to Changchun, to pay his respects to Nanjirō, the commander of the Kwantung Army, and then return home via Andong. After Chaisan returns home, he will go to Europe in the name of being attached to the General Staff Department to investigate military affairs. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Chaisan has been ordered to return home and is scheduled to leave on the 9th. The successor Military Attaché Takahashi came to Peiping from Nanjing at 10:20 AM on the 7th and is scheduled to pay his respects to Huang on the 9th and visit various authorities to make the courtesies after taking office. According to Takahashi, regarding the resolution of the various outstanding issues in the war zone, he has not received new orders and will gradually handle them in accordance with what Military Attaché Chaisan had negotiated with your country in the future. China and Japan should understand each other so that the previous misunderstandings can be completely eliminated, and then East Asia can have peace. When I was in Nanjing, I also discussed this issue with various important figures, and I will work hard to make it happen in the future. I am an old friend of both Committee Chairmen He and Huang, and all issues can be discussed at any time in the future. The illegal actions of Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone can easily harm the feelings between China and Japan. In the future, we will conduct a thorough investigation and both sides will find ways to crack down on them. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The number of opium dens in Yutian is increasing, with more than 50 set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants. Young men and women take opium as the only entertainment. To promote sales, the Japanese have recently invented an injection that dissolves in water and injects into the blood vessels, which is even more addictive than smoking. The poison is no different from morphine. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although the Jixian Paupers' Society was forcibly disbanded by the security team and the leaders were arrested and sent to Peiping, the remnants of the party, Geng Derun, Geng Xuewen, Geng Xuewu, Zhang Ze, Wang Ming, Shang Mingcheng, etc., have all fled to Peiping and Tianjin and are secretly plotting. The security team is still on guard in the local area and has not withdrawn its defense. The people in the Fourth District of Jixian County fear that the party will revive, so they telegraphed the Military Branch Association and the Provincial Government, requesting that Geng and others be strictly arrested and disposed of in order to eliminate the roots. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yang Sen Arrived in Chongqing from Shunqing</p>
<p>Some Aides Arrived First to Visit Liu Xiang</p>
<p>Guizhou Bandits Arrived in Shiqian Planning to Flee to the Sichuan Border</p>
<p>You He and Wu Qiwai Both Arrived in Guiyang</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Yang Sen arrived in Chongqing from Shunqing on the 7th, accompanied by Chief of Staff Liu Junming and Secretary-General Zhang Weishu. Li Jiayu and Huang Qiuxia, brigade commander of the same unit, arrived in Chongqing from Suining on the 6th and visited Liu Xiang on the 7th to report on the situation at the front. Li told a Central News Agency reporter that the communist bandits' combat was nothing particularly extraordinary. In the past, the troops moved at different paces, creating constraints, so they could not win. In the future, power should be centralized in the commander, and rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. He further stated that the Sichuan army should defend the south bank and suppress the north of Sichuan against the communist bandits. If the Guizhou bandits are pursued by the Central Army, they should be intercepted on the Guizhou border to prevent them from crossing over. After the main army arrives to encircle and attack, they can be annihilated. In the northern Sichuan area, they should actively advance to suppress the bandits to avoid being taken advantage of by the bandits. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian reported in the memorial week on the 7th that after Wu Qiwai's troops defeated Zhu Mao's bandit forces and recovered Shibing and Huangping, the bandits fled north to the Sunjia Ferry and Laodu River area, forcibly crossing the Wujiang River. They were intercepted by the Guizhou army's Hou's troops but failed. On the 2nd, the bandits launched a full-scale attack on Yanmen Laodu River, and were again intercepted by the Guizhou army, drowning more than 1,000 bandits. Eventually, due to their numbers, they crossed the river. The main force of the bandits has now arrived in Qingkou, Shiqian, planning to flee to the Sichuan border. The Hunan and Guangxi armies are pursuing and intercepting them in separate directions, striving to prevent them from joining forces with He and Xiao's bandits. He and Xiao's bandits are still occupying Dayong. Our army will launch a general attack on Dayong after the bandits in Sanyang Port, northwest of Taoyuan, are eliminated. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>The Worrying Trend of Decreasing Cultivated Land</h3>
<p>According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, the area of cultivated land in China has increased by only 1% in the past sixty years. However, the area of wasteland accounts for more than 33% of China's total land area. According to a report published by the Central Industrial Experiment Institute in May of last year, the rural population in China has increased by 31% in the past sixty years. From this perspective, the increase in China's rural population is far greater than the increase in the area of cultivated land. It is extremely difficult to achieve economic sufficiency in rural areas with more people and less food. Moreover, Chinese cities have been developing rapidly over the past sixty years, so the increase in population is not limited to rural areas. The amount of cultivated land remains the same as it was sixty years ago. It is appropriate to say that the people's food supply is becoming increasingly worrisome, and even the title of agricultural country will lose its authenticity.</p>
<p>According to the survey of cultivated land in China, there have been several previous surveys that all indicated that cultivated land in China has not only not increased, but has also shown a trend of decrease. For example, during the time of the Beijing government, the Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce stated that cultivated land in China decreased year by year from 1914 to 1918, a total decrease of 265 million mu in five years. The total area of wasteland increased to 84.9 million mu. By 1930, the Ministry of the Interior's Statistics Department surveyed 567 counties and found that this type of wasteland had reached more than 1.1 billion mu. If the entire country were surveyed, the number would be even higher. These statistics all prove that cultivated land in China has decreased year by year, which seems to differ from the current survey. However, when viewed on a large scale, they are still not contradictory. Although the current survey states that the increase in cultivated land is minimal, due to the rapid increase in population, this phenomenon is evidence of the substantial decrease in cultivated land in China. Furthermore, the lack of self-sufficiency in agricultural products in China in recent years, and the large-scale import of foreign rice, foreign wheat, and foreign cotton, are even more obvious.</p>
<p>China's population has already increased. Logically, cultivated land should also increase along with the population. Why has it not only not increased in the past sixty years, but even decreased? The reasons for this are very complex. However, the crux of the matter lies in the frequent natural and man-made disasters, the heavy taxes, and the high-interest exploitation, which have led to farmers working hard all year round, not only being unable to obtain enough food and clothing, but also being unable to recover their invested capital. As a result, those who were originally independent farmers become tenant farmers after experiencing several hardships. Tenant farmers are even less able to support themselves and are reduced to refugees. Other phenomena, such as selling children, eating grass roots and fruit to survive, and widespread starvation, have become the norm in northern China. In recent years, the southeastern provinces have also been hit by natural disasters, and tragic scenes can be seen everywhere in rural areas. Further evidence from various surveys shows that the number of independent farmers has decreased sharply everywhere, and the percentage of farmers in debt has also increased daily. The price of agricultural products has also fallen daily. It has become an iron fact that farmers' hard work throughout the year is not worth the effort. Therefore, the number of people abandoning their fields and fleeing is also increasing daily. If this phenomenon continues, cultivated land in China will inevitably decrease further, and the people's livelihood will face an unimaginable day.</p>
<p>Recently, both the government and the public in our country have paid considerable attention to the dying rural areas. The fiscal conference last year also resolved to abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. However, in reality, only a few have been abolished, and many remain. This is one reason. Furthermore, although the government and businessmen have been providing loans to rural areas, there have been no large-scale actions. A cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood is of no help. That is why high-interest exploitation is still harming rural areas. This also requires the authorities to work hard to improve. Furthermore, although import taxes on foreign rice and wheat have been increased in recent years, they are still imported in large quantities. To protect domestic agriculture, it seems that the tax rates on agricultural products should be increased even more. Other measures, such as reducing railway transportation costs and limiting interest rates on farmer loans, are directly and indirectly related to the recovery of rural areas. If it is within their power, we very much hope that the authorities will quickly plan and implement them.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Includes an Unprecedented Defense Budget</h3>
<p>Totaling 900 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Replenishing Naval, Land, and Air Forces</p>
<p>No Less Than a Direct Response to Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in his budget message today, requested Congress to allocate $4,000,000,000 for industrial and labor expenses for the fiscal year 1936, the largest amount ever. In addition, he also submitted a defense budget, with naval and land forces expenditures totaling a huge $900,000,000, also the largest peacetime figure in American history. The President also stated that he was unable to balance the budget for 1936 as expected. According to the budget submitted by the President today, the expenditure for 1936 is short by approximately $4,528,000,000, bringing the US national debt to a new record of $34,239,000,000. The President stated that without unemployment relief, this year's budget could have been balanced. The message was announced to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at 12:30 p.m. today, stating that expenditures for recovery and relief in 1936 are expected to be reduced compared to this year. The President did not recommend increasing new taxes, but asked Congress to re-pass the special taxes that have expired. The President estimated that the total expenditure for 1936 would be $8,520,000,000, of which $4,938,000,000 would be for government expenses, and the rest would be for recovery and relief. The main recurring expenses of the government are as follows: $1,622,000,000 for the expenses of government departments, $740,000,000 for veterans' pensions, $855,000,000 for public debt interest, $636,000,000 for maturing public debt, and $65,000,000 for tax refunds. The budget explained that the sharp increase in defense expenditure was due to shipbuilding to replenish military strength in accordance with the Washington and London naval treaties. The total defense expenditure in the budget is $792,483,000, of which $447,224,000 is for naval expenditure and $315,259,000 is for land forces expenditure. This year's naval expenditure was $343,053,000, and the land forces expenditure was $269,752,000. However, there is no exact figure for defense expenditure under the public works expenditure item. The expenditure for miscellaneous public works in 1936 is $186,273,000, which also includes defense projects and public buildings. This year's engineering expenditure is $373,895,000. Therefore, the actual defense expenditure will exceed $900,000,000. This can be regarded as President Roosevelt's direct response to Japan's abolition of the naval treaty. The United States currently has 12,000 land forces officers, 118,750 regular troops, and 6,415 Philippine monkey teams. The number of land forces will not be expanded, but land forces equipment will be fully increased. Naval personnel will be increased from the current 82,500 to 93,500. The number of naval landing forces will also not be increased. Naval expenditure will be mainly used for manufacturing new ships and aircraft carriers, including the $100,000,000 for new ships that have already started manufacturing and 24 new ships to be built, as well as $40,000,000 for new ship ordnance and ammunition, and $35,000,000 for aircraft carriers, of which $22,500,000 is for replenishment and $12,500,000 is for new construction. On the land forces side, the expenditure for expanding the air force is $48,383,400, an increase of $20,737,072 compared to last year, most of which is used to purchase 547 new aircraft and train air force personnel, with an estimated 1,352 aircraft. The President estimated the total revenue to be $3,992,000,000. In the 1935 budget, the government's total expenditure was $8,581,000,000, of which $3,321,000,000 was for political expenses and $5,260,000,000 was for recovery and relief.

<h3>New York Handy Harman Company Released Silver Market Annual Report</h3>
<p>(New York) Handy Harman Company released the silver market annual report, reviewing the silver market situation in 1934, stating that if the United States continues to buy, the silver market will continue to stabilize and the price will rise again, but the upward trend depends on the price and quantity purchased by the Treasury. Last year, the Treasury purchased approximately 317,400,000 ounces of silver, and the unsatisfied demand as of December 31 was 1,120,000,000 ounces. One way to greatly reduce purchases is to reduce the value of silver dollars in accordance with the procedure of reducing the value of gold dollars. However, this is only a possibility. Without the Treasury's purchase last year, the silver price would have fallen by one dime instead of rising by one dime. It is estimated that the world's silver production last year was approximately 181,200,000 ounces, of which the United States produced 15,500,000 ounces, Mexico 75,000,000 ounces, Canada 16,300,000 ounces, South America 16,000,000 ounces, and other countries 48,400,000 ounces. Other sources included China's trade surplus of 200,000,000 ounces, the Indian government's sales in London of 30,000,000 ounces, and Russia's sales of 25,000,000 ounces, totaling 436,200,000 ounces. Last year, the world's silver consumption was 436,200,000 ounces, of which the United States received 317,400,000 ounces, Mexico purchased 7,200,000 ounces, Canada 1,700,000 ounces, Peru 1,100,000 ounces, Australia 600,000 ounces, Hong Kong minted 9,000,000 ounces, Cuba 7,800,000 ounces, Colombia 3,600,000 ounces, other countries minted 600,000 ounces, India consumed 15,000,000 ounces, Germany 12,400,000 ounces, and the United States and Canada used 25,000,000 ounces for crafts, the United Kingdom used 13,000,000 ounces, and the remaining 21,800,000 ounces were of unknown use. The annual report reviewed the impact of China's silver export tax, stating that the Chinese Ministry of Finance believes that the high silver price hinders the export of Chinese goods, and that controlling exchange rates can encourage the export of Chinese goods. This concept is correct, but whether this trend can become a reality depends on whether other countries in the world can purchase Chinese products. This purchasing power is still lacking, so the goal of China's trade to be balanced seems to lie in the reduction of imports. If the import of foreign goods is reduced because China continues to implement its protective exchange control measures, then the result of raising the silver price beyond the general price level will be the reduction of China's purchasing power.

<h3>US Silver Purchase Plan Eased, Guaranteeing No Further Increase in Silver Prices: Minister Shih's Cable to Government Reporting</h3>
<p>(Washington) News from Shanghai said the US government has agreed to change its silver purchase plan to help China. This has not been confirmed here today. However, reliable sources claim that the US will no longer excessively increase silver prices, which seems to be the natural result of recent talks between the Chinese and American governments. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai, after repeated negotiations between Chinese Ambassador to the US Shih Chao-chi with US Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, he cabled the Chinese government, saying he had obtained a US guarantee not to excessively increase silver prices. Minister Shih was not seen today, and other personnel at the Chinese Embassy declined to comment on the Shanghai news. According to this news, Minister Shih's report to his home government stated that the US has agreed to find a way to avoid absorbing China's silver reserves when implementing the Silver Purchase Act. Experts here also say that the Treasury Department's recent silver purchases have been relatively small. A sudden increase would disrupt the world market, which US officials do not want. However, the Shanghai news did not specify where silver would be purchased to replace China's current position after negotiations between China and the US. As for the exchange of gold and silver proposed by China, it was discussed, but China's currency system must be completely reformed before the exchange can be implemented. From a political perspective, it is believed here that if the silver faction in Congress does not exert further pressure, the government will absolutely not want to change its recent halt. Even if the silver faction exerts pressure, the government will find other ways to deal with it, and will no longer increase its purchase of silver. Regarding this, one of the most likely methods is to reduce the silver content of the US dollar. In this way, the US does not need so much silver to meet the requirements of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and at the same time can increase the domestic silver price. It is said that most silver faction congressmen may be satisfied with this method. Furthermore, according to news from Shanghai, the Chinese financial community has very divergent opinions on currency policy. Banker Bei Zuyi advocates that the exchange rate of Chinese silver dollars to foreign currencies should be increased, while Song Ziwen believes that it should be left to its natural course. It is now known that Song's proposal will ultimately prevail. Song believes that the exchange rate of Chinese silver dollars to US dollars is four to one, which cannot be said to be abnormal. Many senior consultants to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and well-known bankers also agree with Song's proposal. Many Chinese bankers and businessmen have recently opposed the low amount of the current silver export tax, claiming that it is Bei's proposal. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Case of Schleicher's Murder During the German Coup</h3>
<p>His Comrades Have Not Forgotten Him</p>
<p>A Thorough Investigation Is Now Underway</p>
<p>(London) On the night of June 30, Berlin police rushed into the residence of former German Chancellor General Schleicher, wanting to arrest him. Schleicher resisted arrest, and the police immediately opened fire, killing Schleicher on the spot, and Schleicher's wife was also seriously injured and died. Although six months have passed, Schleicher's comrades have not forgotten him. Last Thursday, the head of the Nazi secret police suddenly convened a large meeting at the Berlin Grand Theater. According to official sources, the purpose of this meeting was to express the unity of the cabinet and the Nazi Party. However, according to a Berlin dispatch from The Times of London, this meeting was related to the death of Schleicher and his wife. Those officers in the National Defense Army who had served under Schleicher felt that this matter must be thoroughly investigated. Last Thursday's meeting was the result of this sentiment. Officers of the National Defense Army expressed their opinions strongly, and it is said that the authorities have given them a satisfactory reply regarding the handling of this case. This is why the government temporarily notified many police chiefs who were on leave to attend the meeting. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the General Staff of the National Defense Army has long urged an investigation into the shooting of Schleicher. It is said that the Veterans' Association has begun an investigation. Based on the above news, it is observed that the official investigation that the government has now allowed must be conducted in secret, so a report on this matter may not be publicly announced.

<h3>Saar Plebiscite Approaching, All Parties Actively Campaigning</h3>
<p>100,000 People Brave Wind and Snow to Rally and Demonstrate</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar - The outdoor rallies of the opposing sides passed quietly today, which is a good omen for an orderly movement of the plebiscite. Although the wind and snow were very heavy this morning, 100,000 members of the German Front still attended a meeting on a small hill outside Saarbrücken. These people sang the national anthem and listened to the leaders' speeches, expecting that the results of the vote would show that the majority belong to Germany. As these people dispersed, they encountered enemy parties heading to a rally at the sports ground. Thereupon, one side shouted ["Long live Hitler!"] and the other side shouted ["Down with Hitler!"], but no conflict occurred. At that time, the current was cut off, so the speeches of the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party could not be broadcast. Therefore, the party leaders' speeches were delayed. After police intervention, it was restored. The speakers all criticized Hitler, and the listeners cheered and raised their arms and fists, vowing to resist Hitler. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the newspapers here all gave extensive coverage to the news of the Saar, regarding the German people holding a large meeting,</p>
<p>Minister of Propaganda Goebbels' public speech, and the news of 350,000 Saar people holding an outdoor rally to oppose the separatist meeting remotely was also detailed without omission. Moreover, each newspaper also published a special Saar edition, uniformly denouncing the speech of the separatist leader Plaum last night as nonsense. As for Vice Chancellor Hess's speech last night, he said ["Heaven's will is so, and the world also says so, the Saar will ultimately belong to Germany"], which all morning newspapers adopted as headlines. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Socialist Party Deputy Leader Hess delivered an important speech on the Saar issue to a large audience at the Berlin Sports Palace tonight. Among the audience were 3,500 people from the Saar. Hess first said that if France accepts the proposal of Führer Hitler, after friendly negotiations, it would automatically return the Saar to Germany, then the orderly progress of the political situation would be even more gratifying. But we still express our sincere gratitude to France today, because the French government has already felt that the popular vote must be carried out as scheduled, and it is also engaged in preparations with sincerity and determination. All things that involve increasing difficulties and behaviors that harm the feelings between Germany and France are avoided as much as possible. Therefore, we deeply feel that the French government will also attach importance to the French nation's love for peace and its concept of justice in the future, and will cooperate with Germany after the popular vote to make the merger of Germany and the Saar achieve a rapid and satisfactory solution in detail. Hess then narrated the origin of the Saar issue, proving that the Saar land is German land, without interruption for more than a thousand years, and even French historians can confirm this. Therefore, the historical problem is even more important than the economic problem, because the land of the Saar has been stained with German blood and fertilized by the sweat of German brows. Therefore, today's problem is entirely a national problem, and the Saar nation is German flesh and blood from head to toe, and is always thinking of returning to the motherland. In the past fifteen years, they have gritted their teeth and maintained their German characteristics. Hess then mentioned the large meeting held by the Nazi Party leaders and the National Defense Army in Berlin last Thursday, saying that those who attended the meeting unanimously praised the leaders of the country, and the unwavering love of the national people for Hitler will make the country even more glorious and great. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Last night, 400 Saar voters who had returned from the United States arrived at the station and were warmly welcomed by the people. The representative of the Propaganda Department also gave a speech at the station, roughly saying, ["When the motherland calls you, you should all fulfill your duties. 60 million Germans are calling for peace and equality. Hitler is a key figure for peace. We should follow him so that Germany can live in peace"]. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Austrian Communist Party Attempted to Assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Failed</h3>

<h3>A Major Key to Peace in Central Europe: France and Italy Reach Complete Compromise</h3>
<p>Four Documents to be Signed Soon</p>
<p>African Issues Also Resolved</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval continued their discussions last night. They have reached complete agreement on all issues, including Italy's request for land in North Africa. Both politicians attended the banquet of the French ambassador at the French embassy last night. After the banquet, they retired to a private room and discussed until nearly midnight.

Laval then introduced the representatives of the French and Italian veterans to Mussolini. At that time, Laval announced that France and Italy had reached a new agreement. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Franco-Italian African Issues</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Premier Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval held talks for three hours yesterday afternoon, and then issued a half-official statement, mainly stating that France and Italy had reached a proper agreement on a pact to guarantee Austria's independence. However, opinions on colonial affairs in Africa were still not in agreement. The two statesmen are now vigorously arguing about ceding African territory to Italy. In the past two days, each has been assisted by experts in African affairs to address this issue with a friendly and determined attitude. Italy's demands are based on the promises of land concessions made by Britain and France to Italy when it joined the Great War in 1915. The colonial issues between France and Italy can be divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p>(1) How many generations of Italian nationals in Tunis should be allowed to retain their nationality?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the land south of Italian Libya, Italy wants the land south of Tibesti Maya. France proposed that the land obtained by Italy should be limited to the area north of that region, fearing that French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa would be cut off.</p>
<p>(3) Italy is now demanding 50 miles of Somaliland, which currently belongs to France.</p>
<p>(4) Italy wants more than 2,000 shares of the Addis Ababa Railway that France has agreed to give to Italy. At the same time, according to Reuters Berlin, the details of the discussions between France and Italy in Rome will be announced to the German Foreign Ministry by the French and Italian ambassadors in Berlin today or tomorrow. Last week, the French ambassador went to the German Foreign Ministry several times to inform the German government of the progress of the negotiations. According to German political circles, they have not received any definite information on the conditions of any new pact proposals. Berlin newspapers comment on the Rome conference with considerable indifference. Germany seems to be trying to delay the matter to give itself time to thoroughly consider its position before expressing its views. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today is the second day of French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Rome. Regarding the results of today's Franco-Italian talks, although the two governments have not yet reached a final agreement, the negotiations can be said to have made important new progress. Among them, the draft pact on maintaining Austria's independence and developing the economy of the Danube River basin has been agreed upon in principle. As for the draft agreement on coordinating the resolution of Franco-Italian disputes in Africa, experts are working hard to reach a compromise between the two countries. It is heard that Italy has accepted the gradual abandonment of the special interests enjoyed by Italian nationals in French Tunisia under the Franco-Italian Treaty of 1896. The deadline for the abandonment has not yet been determined, but it will be no later than 1965. In return for this concession by Italy, France agrees to amend the 1916 agreement on North African colonies. France agrees to cede territory south of Italian Libya along the Tibesti Mountains, but the port of Lake Chad is not included. In Somaliland, France is prepared to revise the border, extend the border of Italian Eritrea, and allow Italy to participate in the operation of the French Djibouti Railway for the export of Abyssinian goods. Although this issue is quite complicated, it is still not difficult to obtain a fair, appropriate, and mutually beneficial solution. Therefore, both France and Italy now hope that the final agreement can be signed tomorrow. After the above four documents are formally signed, the first document, namely the Franco-Italian record of talks, will be sent to the newspapers for publication. However, the remaining three documents will be announced separately in the future. In addition, protocols may be signed stipulating that the governments of France and Italy adopt a coordinated attitude on certain special issues of foreign policy. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Content of Franco-Italian Agreement</p>
<p>(Rome) The wording of the Franco-Italian agreement is now being finalized by representatives of the two countries. The work will continue until morning, and it is expected that the signing will not take place until midday. There are four types of documents in this agreement, which differ slightly from what was transmitted in the previous cable:</p>
<p>(1) An official communique stating that the two governments share harmonious views on major issues related to African colonial affairs and general politics.</p>
<p>(2) A record of the talks between France and Italy, in which the two countries promise to consult each other when Austria's independence is threatened, and to suggest to Austria's neighboring countries and the successor states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire the signing of a pact recognizing mutual respect for existing borders and non-interference in the internal affairs of other signatory countries.</p>
<p>(3) Three draft colonial pacts: (A) Resolving the issue of the status of Italian nationals in French Tunisia. Italy will abandon the special interests enjoyed by Italian nationals under the Franco-Italian Treaty of 1896 in 1965. (B) and (C) Stipulate the territorial concessions made by France in Italian Libya and Somaliland.</p>
<p>(4) Protocol: In this protocol, France and Italy interpret the Five-Power Declaration and agree to declare that if Germany does not conclude a special agreement with the major powers one day, the issue of German rearmament will continue to be open for discussion at any time. The wording of the above documents is temporarily kept secret, but the main points will be explained by Laval and Mussolini in a statement to the press tonight. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Grand Banquet in Rome</p>
<p>(Rome) Last night, the French Embassy in Villa Farnese held a grand banquet, opening a new chapter in the history of Franco-Italian relations. This was only the fourth time that Italian Premier Mussolini had personally visited the embassy to attend a banquet. The previous three visits were merely of a diplomatic nature. Last night, the embassy gate was brightly lit by electric torches, illuminating it as if it were daytime. All the windows were decorated with lights in the Roman style. The Galara Gallery in the embassy is a famous building, and the banquet was held there. Guests gathered together, including two famous generals who had won the highest medals in Italy, in addition to Italian Prime Minister and French Foreign Minister Laval: General Bartoglio and Naval Admiral Teon di Laval. Other dignitaries included Undersecretaries Suvich and Lassoni, former Italian ambassadors to France Avanzana, Naxi, and Mansoni, followed by Count Volpi, Baron Aloisi, and key figures from the Italian Foreign Ministry who participated in the Franco-Italian talks. Cabinet ministers and prominent figures from Roman society also participated in the grand event. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Germany Indifferent, Austria Satisfied</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the German government is now adopting a reserved attitude towards the Franco-Italian agreement, because Germany must carefully study this pact before it can decide whether to participate or not. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the negotiations between France and Italy in Rome, German political circles maintain an extremely reserved attitude, and newspapers have not issued any clear comments, presumably due to instructions from the authorities. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian Foreign Minister recently met with foreign reporters and made an important statement, placing great importance on the frequent meetings between Italian and Austrian political figures, and the occasional talks with Hungarian diplomatic representatives. Regarding the future cultural agreement, he said that the agreement concluded with Italy was based entirely on the spirit of reciprocity and complete understanding. As for Austria's position in the Franco-Italian negotiations, the Foreign Minister said that Austria welcomes the negotiations, because the negotiations are entirely the result of Austria's loyal and powerful allies, and Austria should express unlimited sympathy for these allies. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Simon, who is currently on his way back to London from the Riviera, told guests today that he personally is very satisfied with the Franco-Italian agreement, saying that the pact greatly strengthens the peace of Europe. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Rome has suggested that Britain should be invited to participate in the Franco-Italian agreement on the integrity of Austrian territory. London diplomatic circles do not agree, saying that on February 17, 1934, Britain, France, and Italy jointly announced that the three governments shared the same views on the need to maintain Austria's independence. This declaration contained the intention of the three countries to prepare to consult when necessary, so Britain's position has already been clarified. Many believe that Britain does not need to issue another declaration now. It is heard that the governments of France and Italy are now satisfied with the British government's position on this matter.

<p>Interpretation of Eligibility for Committee Members of Trade Associations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central People's Movement Committee requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret the eligibility of committee members of trade associations. The answer is as follows: Committee members are selected from representatives of members. Therefore, if the store that originally dispatched the representative has closed down, or if the representative himself has completely separated from the association's business, according to Article 4 of Item 2 of the revised Guidelines for Guiding People's Movement (the constituent members of people's organizations should be based on the principle of prohibiting those who are not currently engaged in the profession from participating), their eligibility as committee members should naturally be lost. If the representative himself leaves the store that originally dispatched him, he has lost the basis for his dispatch, and his original eligibility cannot continue to exist. If, after leaving, he serves in another store that has joined the association, even if the store re-nominates him as a representative, his old eligibility has already been lost, and if he has not been nominated, there is no need to discuss it.

<p>Japanese Business in Wuhu Plans to Lease Land to Build Wharf</p>
<p>Special Commissioner Telegraphed Provincial Government and Foreign Ministry for Instructions; Local Landowners from Jiangxi Vow to Oppose to the Death</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the Opium War and the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, Wuhu has been opened as one of the commercial ports along the Yangtze River. Foreign shipping companies have been able to dock at Wuhu to transport goods and passengers. The impact on our shipping rights and commerce has been enormous. Jardine Matheson, Swire, and other companies have successively leased land along the riverbank to set up lighters and wharves. Their business is far more prosperous than our only China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company spared no effort to set up a barge dock upstream of the Jardine Matheson Wharf two years ago, which made it slightly more convenient for passengers to get on and off the ship. Japanese ships have also been sailing between Shanghai and Hankou for a long time. However, in Wuhu, apart from setting up the Osaka barge in the middle of the river, they have not had a wharf on the riverbank due to the lack of an address. However, for the sake of business competition, the desire to find land and develop a wharf has never been forgotten. A Japanese company once planned to purchase the Jiang'an riverbank for 150,000 yuan for the purpose of building a wharf, but the land rights belonged to fellow Jiangxi natives living in Wuhu. The people of Jiangxi, deeply aware of the importance of national sovereignty and understanding the general righteousness, refused to accept the offer, and the matter was suspended. Recently, seeing that the commercial ships of various companies on the Yangtze River have wharves and barge docks, which are much more convenient for travelers to get on and off the ship than using small boats, and that there is no possibility of winning the competition in terms of business, they again stirred up the Japanese Consul in Wuhu, Yoshiharu Kichi, to write to the Wuhu Second District Special Commissioner's Office, proposing to build a bridge on the Linjiang beach first, so that the riverbank can directly reach the barge, and re-submitted the previous proposal to lease land to build a wharf, and repeatedly met to discuss, expressing that it must achieve its purpose. Currently, Special Commissioner Wang Baoqi has telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. At the same time, the Jiangxi people living in Wuhu believe that the land is their property and that the Chinese people have an obligation to protect the shipping rights and land rights of the motherland. They have vowed to oppose this to the end and will never lose an inch of land to be seized by others. They have organized a committee to protect the land and shipping and vow to oppose it to the death. (6th)</p>
<p>Respect for the Elderly Meeting Held in Taiyuan</p>
<p>Two Hundred Elders Participate in the Grand Event; Ninety-Three-Year-Old Man Leads in Singing</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Provincial Public Education Center invited the elderly over seventy years old in Taiyuan to hold a respect for the elderly meeting at the center on New Year's Day this year. Zhao Cilong, former Director of the Supervisory Yuan, attended the meeting and gave a speech. More than two hundred elders participated, and more than a thousand people watched, making it a very grand occasion. After the meeting, commemorative badges were issued, and a tea party was held. Here is a record of the proceedings: On that day, Director Wang Gengshen and Deputy Director Ke Dingchu, along with the staff of the center, warmly welcomed the guests on the spot. By 11:00 AM, the participating elders, in groups of three or five, came together. They were all over seventy years old. Although they were old and frail, they were delighted. Most of them were accompanied by their children and grandchildren, with white hair and young faces reflecting each other, creating a picturesque scene. The respect for the elderly meeting was held in the auditorium of the Public Education Center. National flags were crossed in front of the door, and slogans were posted on both sides. Inside the hall was a plaque with the words "[Meeting with Elderly Heroes]." The seats for the elderly were in the middle, and the sides were for male and female guests to visit. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Wang Gengshen presided over the meeting and performed the rituals. Then, Zhao Cilong was invited to give a speech, in which he praised the elders, and brought printed copies of "He Ding Jian" (recorded from the Surangama Sutra) to distribute on the spot. After the speech, he shouted "Amitabha" three times, and the whole audience echoed him, as if they were in a meditation hall. Zhao's devotion to Buddhism can be seen from this. Then, the famous painter and calligrapher Chang Zanchun lectured on the system of respecting the elderly in the past. Then, the ninety-three-year-old Wang Fuji was invited to report on his life and sing a "Waking the World Song" once. His tone was clear and bright, not diminished by age, proving that he usually knew how to maintain his health and was not declining in old age. The next speaker after Wang was the seventy-five-year-old Su Jiwen, whose words were humorous and relaxed, creating a lot of fun. Then, Ke Dingchu gave a reply. Finally, commemorative badges were distributed, and after photography and refreshments, the staff of the center led the elders to visit all the exhibition halls of the center, and showed movies in the center's public cinema and played music in the auditorium to entertain the elders. Wang Fuji, the ninety-three-year-old man attending the meeting, and Chang Zanchun, the painter and calligrapher, both immediately wrote inscriptions to commemorate the event. (2nd)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault Outside the East Gate</p>
<p>Wu Weiyuan, a resident of Xinbang in the 18th Tu outside the East Gate of this city, and his two brothers, the eldest of whom runs the Yongsheng Rice Store in Guozilong, were attacked at about 12 o'clock last night (the 6th) by more than a dozen robbers speaking Jiangbei and local dialects. The robbers jumped in over the outer fence of the Wu family, calling out the victim's name and ordering everyone not to look at them. The robbers were all wearing blue-black short coats and armed with box cannons and Browning guns. They forbade anyone from making noise and carried out a reckless search. Wu Weiyuan's brother was beaten and tied up by the robbers with wooden objects, leaving him covered in injuries. The robbers searched for about an hour before fleeing with their loot. Upon inspection, they found that cash, gold jewelry, pearls, jade, and antiques had been stolen, especially from the two rooms occupied by the newly married couple. Because the bride had returned to Ningbo, the losses could not be calculated. The injured victim has been sent to the Yinhang Hospital for treatment, and the incident has been reported to the relevant Fourth Public Security Substation for investigation and pursuit of the stolen goods. Xinbang is close to Song City, and this major robbery has made residents uneasy.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault in the City</p>
<p>Wen Muxian, a rice dealer at the Zhaoyuan Rice Store outside Fengmen, was delivering rice to Xie Yaqian and the Yu Chang Rice Store in front of the North Temple on the 6th. Along the way, he collected 156.695 yuan in rice payments. It was already 6:30 PM when he returned. As he was walking near the Nanshuixian Alley in front of the Shuixian Temple in the Cucumber Lane intersection, three burly men suddenly came up from behind and used a sack to cover his head. They then dragged him to a secluded place, used the hemp rope from his rice bag to tie his feet, and then used a sharp blade to slash his forehead. They then stabbed him twice in the thigh, each about an inch deep. They took all the rice payments from his person and fled without a trace. Zhou was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. A passerby noticed him and reported the incident, and he was sent to Zhuanxi Hospital by police car. A search for the robbers is underway, but as of the afternoon of the 7th, nothing has been found.</p>
<p>Joint Military and Police Parade</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wu Qiyun, in order to strengthen the defense of the city and unify command, organized a winter defense committee, appointing officers from the military, police, business groups, and security teams as members. It is now scheduled to hold the first joint parade of the military, police, business groups, and security teams in the urban area at the Public Sports Ground at 9:00 AM today (the 8th). County Magistrate Wu will give a speech and hold a defense meeting to maintain local security.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Account Collector Robbed on the Way</p>
<p>Zhou Yiyan, manager of the Yuelai Yiwandian in this city, was returning from collecting accounts in Kunshan at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. While traveling by rickshaw between Malu and Nanxiang, south of Yandun, three robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside in the darkness, blocking his way with flashlights and pistols. One of them spoke in a Jiangbei accent, while the other two remained silent. They searched Zhou's entire body for a long time, stealing twelve ten-yuan banknotes from the China Industrial Bank and other miscellaneous coins, totaling 138 yuan. They also took a pocket watch and a seal. After completing the search, the robbers took off Zhou's cotton robe and fled south with their loot.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Poor People Surround the County Government</p>
<p>The First District Office here has always distributed relief grain to the poor. Impoverished elderly men and women in the district can go to collect it. Beforehand, the township heads submit reports, and distribution is done by name and number. The distribution date is traditionally the first day of each lunar month, with each person receiving 600 cash. This money relies entirely on income from tea house donations. However, since the implementation of the treasury system, this tax revenue is now collected and deposited by the county government, making withdrawals difficult. Therefore, the relief grain has not been distributed for three months. Yesterday (the 6th) was the scheduled distribution date for the twelfth lunar month. In addition to the copper coins, each person is also given a set of cotton clothes and pants, so even more people went to collect it, reaching a total of</p>
<p>four to five hundred men, women, and children. They surrounded the district office from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The district chief informed them that the tax revenue had been transferred to the county government. The crowd then went to the county government to request the distribution, but they were dispersed by the police. The poor people all returned with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>Deadline of Three Days to Finish Baojia Work</p>
<p>This county has been ordered to implement the Baojia system. After the county magistrate and others made great efforts to promote it, progress has been very smooth. The second phase of Jia compilation is mostly completed. However, due to recent continuous rain and muddy roads, progress has been hindered. However, according to provincial regulations, the third phase of work should begin this month. The county government, fearing delays, has ordered all district chiefs to complete the second phase of work and produce all Baojia chiefs within three days. The third phase of work should begin on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Build a Highway</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province is building a highway that encircles Taihu Lake, linking it to the highway in Zhejiang Province. The section from Wuxi to Yixing in Jiangsu Province has already been completed. The Sujia Highway will also connect to Zhejiang Province at the same time. Only the section from Wuxi to Suzhou has not yet been built. Recently, the SuFu Motor Company invested in building the Sumu Road, deciding to extend the route to Guangfu, which is expected to be completed by mid-March. At the same time, the Construction Department has also decided to build a highway from Wuxi via Wangting to Guangfu, in order to connect to the Guangfu section of the Sumu Road, completely completing the provincial highway encircling Taihu Lake. Construction is being expedited and is scheduled to be fully opened to traffic in March. It will then connect to Zhejiang Province's Jiahu Highway, allowing direct automobile traffic between the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Fire in Houshuyuan Alley</p>
<p>The residence of Sun Zhicheng at No. 25 Houshuyuan Alley in the city, located in the middle of the alley, has a total of three bays. The first two bays are single-story, and the third bay is a two-story building. Apart from a portion used by himself, the rest is rented out. Qian Zixiang's family, in the west of the third bay, recently went down to the countryside to attend a wedding banquet, leaving only the maid Zhu Ma at home to guard the door. At 5:30 PM on the day before yesterday (the 6th), Zhu Ma had just returned to the room from washing the chamber pot outside when she suddenly saw thick smoke and flames billowing from the upstairs. She shouted "Fire!" Various firefighting teams rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. However, the New County Front River channel was shallow and difficult to draw water from, causing the fire to spread. The teams then turned to Jingshu River to draw water and extinguish the fire. However, the three-bay building had already been completely destroyed, causing losses of over ten thousand yuan. During the firefighting, Tao Quangen, a member of the sixth fire brigade in the central district, fell heavily on the Lihuangni Bridge and was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Yinjiang</h3>
<p>Privately Made Poison Pills Sent to the Provincial Court for Trial</p>
<p>Li Ruibao, Li Guozhen, Song Chunxiang and other residents of the West Street of Wuchangjing Town, privately set up an organization, secretly manufactured red pills and potent drugs. On November 16th of last year, at midnight, they were reported to the chamber of commerce by the town's drug resistance committee. Song Qixiang and Shen Yu's wife, Ms. Li, were apprehended along with equipment, poisonous pills and other evidence and sent to the county government. They have been interrogated several times. On the 4th, they were brought back to court for a retrial. Song Qixiang testified that all the items were stored by Li Guozhen and that he had no improper relationship with his cousin Shen Li. After the interrogation, the judge Jiang concluded that the case involved the private production of poison pills, which this court had no jurisdiction to try. A written report will be prepared and sent to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for legal handling.</p>
<p>Petition of Representatives of Private Small Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>After the privately operated long-distance bus service was established and a macadam road surface was built, privately operated small motor vehicles were only allowed to operate if they had a motor vehicle business and paid a deposit of 100 yuan. The small motor vehicles were struggling to make a living, so Yang Zhaoxiang and others were elected as representatives and came to the county government from Xicheng on the 5th to petition. Secretary Wu received them and the representatives requested approval to set up a joint office and reduce the deposit. Secretary Wu promised to convey the request to the provincial authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Canal Water Rises Sharply in Winter</p>
<p>After winter, the water in the Li Canal within Huaiyin usually drops, never rises. Therefore, it is inconvenient for Qingzhen ferries to operate in winter and they often have to stop. However, recently, the canal water has not only not dropped, but the water level has risen to over four feet, resulting in a water level of two zhang and one chi in Qingjiang and a water level of four zhang, seven chi, and four cun at the Yunkou Fantou Dam. Also, the water level between Qing'an and Fanduo is over two zhang and six chi. This is unprecedented in the past few years. According to canal workers, this year's situation is special because the Liu Lao Jian Dam was closed last winter, causing all the water from the central canal to flow into Li Canal. Secondly, the Weishan Lake Dam was opened, causing a large amount of lake water to flow into the canal. These are the main reasons.</p>
<p>County Notice Strictly Prohibiting the Small Swords Society</p>
<p>Since the Small Swords Society riots in the territory of the Second District of Huaiyin, which resulted in the burning and killing of Yue Kuan Tianjia's family, the rebels have been secretly gathering and have not dispersed. They have ordered blacksmith shops to rush to produce knives and guns day and night, hoping to launch a reckless uprising. The county government received a report and yesterday issued a joint notice with Commander Cao of the garrison, stating that, according to reports, the Small Swords Society in various parts of the Second District is plotting an uprising and rushing to make broadswords. This is a serious violation of the law. Therefore, this notice is issued to inform the public that they must reflect on their actions as soon as possible. Otherwise, if discovered, they will be arrested and punished severely without leniency.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Pacifying the Coastal Areas of Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>After a large number of coastal bandits in northern Jiangsu were attacked by Chi Yaozong, the third district chief of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, who led the major teams of Liuhe, Qidong, Nantong, and Yancheng, as well as the provincial security team's mortar team, and the Haijun Minister's Changfeng Shenghu and E three gunboats, the bandits were defeated. Chief Chi Ke is leaving his troops to pacify the sea. Shen himself transferred to Yancheng to pursue and suppress the fleeing bandits.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Theft from the Bank of China Warehouse</p>
<p>The Jiaxing branch of the Bank of China, at the request of the county chamber of commerce and the advice of the county government, established a warehouse to allow farmers and businesses to mortgage goods for funding. The warehouse was established at the Huili Cocoon Factory site at the Zha Yan bottom of Middle Street. Since its establishment, industry, commerce, and farmers have been able to obtain loans by mortgaging goods, which has been of great benefit. Unexpectedly, the second warehouse was entered by thieves through a hole dug in the back wall in the middle of the night the day before yesterday. Forty-three bags of unpolished rice, totaling twenty-one dan and five dou, were stolen. The theft was discovered the next morning and reported to the Fifth Police Station. The Criminal Investigation Team of the County Public Security Bureau went to investigate and ordered a separate search.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Prostitute Commits Suicide Over Love Affair</p>
<p>Chen Hua, a prostitute, also known as Hong Guiying, 26 years old, from Shangyu, who works at No. 228 Hangzhou Road, Gongbu, was very popular. Chen had a regular customer named Wang Bingrong, a shop assistant at a cloth store in Qinghefang, who was from Pingyao, Hangzhou County. The two had a very close relationship and had made a lifelong commitment. Wang had not visited Gongbu for two months after losing his job, so Chen suspected that Wang had fallen in love with someone else. She went to Pingyao to visit him and found that Wang did indeed have a wife and children. She immediately swallowed the gold jewelry she was wearing and committed suicide. After being discovered, she was rushed back by car, but she died at Xiaohe. The Hangzhou District Court was notified and sent a prosecutor to examine and prepare the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Farmer Couple Commits Suicide Due to Crop Failure</p>
<p>Xiaoshan suffered a severe drought last summer and autumn, and the harvest was poor. Farmers in the four townships are unable to make a living in the middle of winter, and there are daily reports of people committing suicide. In Dongwang, in the west of the district, a farmer named Wang Jichen's family of seven, who farmed more than ten mu of land, had no harvest since the drought last summer, and they had no straw for roofing. On the 4th of this month, the landlord demanded the payment of rent, and Wang could not pay, so he hanged himself. His wife, because her husband had already committed suicide, and she was unable to support the family, also drowned herself in the Wenyan Pond on the afternoon of the 5th. She was pulled out of the water, but she had already died.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Record of the First Trial Run on the Luohua Section of the Huainan Railway</p>
<p>The Central Construction Committee began construction in the spring of the 23rd year of the Huainan Coal Mine Railway, from Luohe Street to the Erba Dam in Wuhu. It was supervised by Chief Engineer Chen Shifan, with a budget of 8 million yuan. The section from Luohe to Hefei was completed by early last winter. The section between Zhujia Alley, 100 li from Hefei, and Luohe had already been opened to traffic, but two bridges on the way from Zhujia Alley to Hefei had not yet been completed. Chief Engineer Chen had agreed with the Construction Committee that the Luohe section would be opened to traffic by the end of the 23rd year, so after winter, he supervised the workers to speed up construction day and night. Fortunately, the bridges were completed by mid-December. It was decided to open the line to traffic on the 30th. Chen traveled from Luohe to Shanghai by train. After receiving the notice, the Railway Engineering Office in Hefei prepared a welcome in advance and invited various public organizations to visit. However, due to more than ten days of rain, Chen feared that the newly built roadbed was not stable and temporarily suspended the opening on the 30th. He sent employees to inspect the entire section once. On the 31st, Chen departed from Luohe at 8:00 AM, riding on a locomotive pulling eight freight cars, driving slowly to prevent danger. At 12:00 PM, he arrived at Zhujia Alley. After a short stop, he drove east, but carefully inspected the route along the way. He finally arrived at the temporary station outside the east gate at 9:00 PM. The Railway Engineering Office in Hefei set off firecrackers to welcome him. That night, he sent an urgent telegram to the Construction Committee, to fulfill the previous agreement. After resting until noon on the 1st of this month, Chen returned to Luohe on the original train. It was decided to officially start selling tickets and opening the line to traffic to the Hechao section one month later. The construction has now reached Qiaotouji, 70 li from Hefei. Because Fang Mountain is blocking the way, explosives are being used to blast it away. The opening to Chao may be in the summer of this year.</p>
<h3>Special Feature</h3>
<p>Personal Views on Revising the Current Trademark Law</p>
<p>Ho Cheuk-Hin's Introduction</p>
<p>Since the Judicial Yuan issued a response to the Executive Yuan in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, clarifying that the term "文字" [words] in Article 1, Section 2 of the current Trademark Law [words used in a trademark] [does not include pronunciation] (see Judicial Yuan Consultation No. 1003, published in the 100th issue of the Judicial Yuan Gazette), it has aroused unanimous attention from the whole country. Everyone feels that the current Trademark Law does indeed have many shortcomings in practice. Therefore, revising the current Trademark Law has become a common demand. In the business and industry circles, because of their close relationship with the Trademark Law, several articles have been published successively, such as Chen Xuyuan's "The Necessity of Supplementing the Trademark Law," Hu Xiyuan's "Opinions on the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation of Trademarks," and Pan Yang's "Noteworthy Issues of Trademark Law: Word Form and Pronunciation," etc. (all can be found in major Shanghai newspapers and the special issue on trademark issues of the 97th issue of the Federation of Industry and Commerce Journal). Summarizing their opinions, most of them advocated that the words used in a trademark should include pronunciation. In terms of government agencies, the Trademark Bureau also submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward to the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan for further interpretation of Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law. The Executive Yuan, at the end of December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, even automatically consulted the Judicial Yuan for further interpretation of the ambiguities in Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law. As a result, the Judicial Yuan still maintained the previous interpretation without change.</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and accountants, in July of the 23rd year, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce felt that the current Trademark Law was quite unsuitable for the industrial and commercial situation, and organized a Trademark Law Research Committee. The selected members were all Shanghai manufacturers' leaders, who gathered to research and propose opinions to the Legislative Yuan for appropriate amendments to the current Trademark Law (see the Shanghai Shen Bao and Shishi Xinbao on July 17th of the 23rd year). This research committee is still constantly holding meetings to discuss issues. On August 13th of the same year, Shanghai accountants Li Wenjie and Qin Yanzhao published an article in the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao expressing their opinions on revising the Trademark Law, proposing six points. Accountant Li has conducted considerable research on the Trademark Law, and their joint opinions are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>On August 14th of the 23rd year, the Ministry of Industry issued an order to the Trademark Bureau, instructing it to draft a revised draft of the Trademark Law in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The Ministry of Industry specifically ordered the Trademark Bureau to use its case-handling experience to draft a revised draft addressing areas of the Trademark Law that were not yet perfect and submit it for review. After receiving this order, the Trademark Bureau conducted a meticulous study of each article of the Trademark Law, and as a result, listed its opinions and submitted a document to the Ministry on December 12th.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the situation after the Judicial Yuan interpreted Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law, in which all parties felt the need to revise the current Trademark Law.</p>
<p>The author feels that due to the evolution of the times, the current Trademark Law inevitably has some aspects that those who formulated the law at that time could not have foreseen. This has not only aroused unanimous attention across the country after the same court interpreted Article 1, Section 2, but even after the government promulgated the Trademark Law in May of the 19th year, many jurists have already made multiple criticisms of it. The structure of Chinese society has its own unique circumstances. This Trademark Law, which is closely related to our country's emerging industry and commerce, should be adapted to the national conditions and the fair conditions of the law in order to become a good law. This is something we cannot help but pay close attention to. Everyone knows that the purpose of formulating the Trademark Law is to protect trademark exclusive rights. However, let us carefully examine whether the current Trademark Law has done its best to protect trademark exclusive rights under the two conditions of adapting to national conditions and complying with legal fairness. I think anyone who pays a little attention will feel that there must be room for discussion. Since there is such a situation, and the law is not an ironclad case once it is promulgated, there is still a way to modify it to remedy it when necessary. The revision of the Trademark Law has become a common demand, as mentioned above. Based on the author's experience in handling trademark cases over the past three years, after the Trademark Bureau officially submitted a document to the Ministry with its opinions on revising the Trademark Law, I will further clarify each point that should be revised or added to the current Trademark Law.</p>
<p>1. Regarding the Issue of Trademark Names</p>
<p>Opening the current Trademark Law, from the first article to the last, there is absolutely no provision regarding trademark names. This shortcoming can only be understood by realizing the importance of trademark names. Every trademark has a name, just as every person has a name. In ordinary general transactions, the buyer only needs to verbally state that they are purchasing goods with a certain trademark name, and the seller will give them goods with that trademark name. Even in large-scale trade, the buyer will definitely state in the order letter or telegram that they are ordering goods with a certain trademark, and there is absolutely no detailed list of the graphic state of the trademark. For example, when buying [White Gold Dragon] trademark cigarettes, the buyer only needs to say [White Gold Dragon], and the shop assistant will naturally sell you the pack or tin of [White Gold Dragon] cigarettes. This proves that the name is an important condition of any trademark and is inseparable from the trademark itself. If there are two or more trademarks with the same name in the same commodity, according to the previous example, there are two or more [White Gold Dragon] trademark cigarettes with the same name, regardless of whether the graphics, symbols, etc. of the trademarks themselves are the same, the seller can freely sell one of the two or more types once the buyer calls out the name. Isn't this kind of malpractice greatly contrary to the purpose of the Trademark Law in protecting trademark exclusive rights? The current Trademark Law has clear provisions on various conditions of the trademark itself, such as words, graphics, symbols, and colors. Why is this other main condition 丨丨name丨丨 ignored, and no protective provisions are added? Although the Trademark Bureau has always prohibited the subsequent registration of trademarks with the same name, after all, the current Trademark Law does not stipulate this clearly, and it is inevitable to feel that there is no legal basis for doing so. Article 1, Section 2 of the current Trademark Law stipulates all the conditions of the trademark itself. I propose to add a provision regarding trademark names in the same article and section. Then, the original provision should be changed to [The words, graphics, symbols, or their combination used in the trademark must be particularly prominent, and specify the name and the colors applied].</p>
<p>2. Regarding the Issue of Trademark Word Pronunciation</p>
<p>Although the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of the words used in a trademark stipulated in Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law as [not including pronunciation] has aroused countless criticisms, once the law is interpreted by the statutory authority, it should be implemented according to its interpretation. Therefore, we do not need to discuss this interpretation of the Judicial Yuan any further. However, from the perspective of the legislative purpose of the Trademark Law, if the words used in a trademark do not include pronunciation, then unscrupulous people will take advantage of the loopholes in the regulations, try their best to use words with the same pronunciation as the words used in registered trademarks as trademarks, and carry out disguised imitation. This is greatly contrary to the legislative purpose of protecting trademark exclusive rights. First, as I have said above, in ordinary general transactions, the buyer only needs to verbally say that they are buying goods with a certain trademark, and the seller can sell it to them accordingly. Therefore, I advocate that clear provisions should be added to trademark names. Trademarks with the same name are certainly sufficient to cause mistaken purchases, but trademarks with the same pronunciation can also cause confusion in transactions. This is with regard to trademark names. The words used in trademarks should include pronunciation. Second, many trademarks, especially Western medicine trademarks, are composed of only two or three words, such as [Lysol	Machine], [Guoneng	Cling]. These types of trademarks only constitute a very simple concept in the minds of buyers. In other words, buyers can only recall those few words in their minds. If the words used in the trademark do not include pronunciation, there will inevitably be word trademarks with the same pronunciation in the same commodity. Since the law cannot prohibit them, buyers will inevitably be at a loss and make mistaken purchases. This is with regard to word trademarks. The words used in trademarks should also include pronunciation. In addition, assuming that there are two trademarks in the same commodity, one is called [Bat Deer Brand] and the other is called [Fu Lu Brand], I dare to say that buyers will definitely make mistaken purchases because in ordinary general transactions, the seller gives the goods based on the buyer's verbal call. Also, assuming that there are two word trademarks in the same commodity, one is wrigley and the other is rwgly, I am also convinced that the coexistence of these two trademarks will definitely cause confusion in transactions because many buyers often only remember the pronunciation of the words. In summary, the malpractice of confusion in the pronunciation of trademark words is no less than the similarity of graphics, symbols, etc. The Trademark Bureau has always only allowed one of the word trademarks with confusing pronunciations, such as [Yin Dan Shi Lin] and [Yin Tang Shi Ling], [Wei Jing] and [Wei Jin], or trademarks with the same name, such as [Fish Head] and [Jade Hand], stacombaa and suckomb, to be registered for exclusive use. I believe that this approach is very consistent with the legislative purpose of the Trademark Law in protecting trademark exclusive rights. However, since the Judicial Yuan's interpretation case does not allow us not to comply, in order to remedy the various malpractices caused by not considering the pronunciation of trademark words, I propose to add a clause after Article 1, Section 2 of the current Trademark Law. The clause is [The words used in the trademark include pronunciation, based on the national pronunciation of each country]. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Unwilling to Express Anything to the Press</p>
<p>Our country's Minister to Belgium, Zhang Naiyan, returned to China on summons and arrived in Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso at 2:30 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Zhao Tiezhang, Section Chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and friends of Mr. Zhang, went to the port to welcome him. After disembarking, Mr. Zhang went straight to his private residence on Daxilu Road to rest. Mr. Zhang did not want to express anything to the press, only saying that he was on leave for three months and would go to Beijing that evening or the next to pay his respects to Foreign Minister Wang and report on his experiences abroad. While abroad, Minister Zhang was not only responsible for handling diplomatic negotiations, but also for investigating construction projects in various countries on behalf of the Construction Committee, resulting in physical exhaustion. This time, he requested leave to return to China, partly to report on the diplomatic situation and the results of his investigations, and partly to recover from his accumulated fatigue. According to what Minister Zhang told visitors yesterday, the situation of the European powers is currently extremely tense, but there is still considerable understanding between France and Germany. Although the situation in Southern European countries is extremely complicated, it is unlikely to lead to conflict for the time being. Moreover, since the Great War, the people's aversion to war has not diminished in the slightest. There will probably be no war in 1935. Before leaving Europe, Mr. Zhang personally went to various European countries to conduct on-site investigations. The number of unemployed people in various countries is decreasing day by day, and they are all able to live and work in peace. This is because the government promotes production and construction to solve the people's livelihood problems. Confucius said, "Enrich them, then teach them." Guanzi said, "When the granary is full, then they know etiquette and righteousness; when they have enough food and clothing, then they know honor and shame." Therefore, our country's fundamental plan is to concentrate its efforts on developing production and construction to solve the people's livelihood problems. As for Sino-Belgian relations, they are exceptionally cordial. Our country has about two hundred students studying abroad, all of whom are able to be pragmatic and strive to learn, and are expected to be promising young people in the future. It is heard that Mr. Zhang will soon go to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and report on the diplomatic situation, as well as make a statement to Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the National Government Construction Committee.</p>

<p>Shen Yi Returned to China Yesterday and Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Returned from Attending the International Road Conference, Gave a Written Statement on the Ship Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, was ordered to go to Germany in June last year to attend the Seventh International Road Conference and participate in the Yellow River Experiment hosted by Professor Engels of Germany. He completed his official duties last month and returned to China on the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso. He arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Those who went to welcome him included Mr. Li Dachao, Section Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government; Xu Yuanfang, Director of the Two Roads General Affairs Office; Mo Heng, Director of the Materials Office; Zheng Baocheng, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Utilities Bureau; Xue Cixin, Qiu Xieyun, Xiao Qingyun, Xu Guansan, Tan Wenqing, senior officials of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and many of his relatives and friends. After disembarking, Mr. Shen went straight to his private residence to rest. Mr. Shen is scheduled to return to work within a few days and report everything to the government and the National Economic Council. In addition to Mrs. Shen, Mr. Zhou Fengjiu and Mr. Tong Enjiong, representatives of our country who attended the road conference, also returned to China with Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen gave a written statement on the ship yesterday, saying: "I was ordered by the government in early June last year to go to Germany to attend the Seventh International Road Conference, and was entrusted by the National Economic Council and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to participate in the Yellow River Experiment hosted by Professor Engels of Germany. It has been seven months now. A total of six representatives from our country attended the road conference. The government representatives were originally Chen Ticheng and myself. Later, Mr. Chen was unable to go due to official business, and Zhao Zukang took his place. In addition, there were Mr. Zhou Fengjiu and Mr. Tong Enjiong, representatives of the Hunan Provincial Government, and Mr. Wang Nanyuan, a representative of the Anhui Provincial Government, and Mr. Jiang Hong, a representative of the China National Road Construction Association. The conference opened in Munich, Germany on September 3 last year and closed in Berlin on the 18th. Representatives from 49 countries attended, with a total of more than 2,000 people. There were six items on the agenda, including asphalt roads, cement roads, the most economical road construction methods, traffic management, transportation, and safety issues. Several months before the conference, the International Road Association distributed the above-mentioned agenda items to each member country, and the association prepared a general report based on the reports of each country. The task of the conference was to discuss this general report, with no other proposals or texts for discussion. This is different from general conferences. The report of our country this time was compiled and sent by the National Economic Council after the relevant parties provided materials in advance. Not only was it consistent with the form of other countries, but also its content was not inferior. Therefore, it has received much attention from the representatives of various countries. This road conference is held every four years. The next, that is, the eighth conference, will be held in the Netherlands in 1938. The location of the ninth conference is approximately in Hungary. The locations of the subsequent conferences have not yet been determined. When the conference closed in Berlin this time, I, in my capacity as the leader of the Chinese delegation, made a speech, revealing my hope that we could have a conference in our country in the future so that people from all countries could truly recognize the new China that is struggling for peace. I deeply hope that during this period, the country will become more unified day by day and gradually embark on the road of production and construction, and with the doubled efforts of engineers across the country, it will not be difficult to have better results in ten years to meet the world, and it is not impossible to have the day when the conference is held in our country. The biggest feeling of this trip is that, looking at all countries, there is a comprehensive plan and a certain policy for road construction. Even some countries, because they do not produce asphalt in their country, would rather give up asphalt roads than build them. This kind of spirit is very worthy of emulation. Of our six people, in addition to Zhou Fengjiu and Tong Enjiong, who returned to China on the same boat as me, Zhao Zukang returned to China via the Americas. Wang Nanyuan and Jiang Hong were originally studying in Germany and are still in Germany. Regarding the Yellow River Experiment, I will submit a detailed written report to the National Economic Council. This experiment is a continuation of the previous two years' experiments. It started in the mountains of southern Germany in June last year and was completed in mid-November. The experiment was divided into four groups, and its purpose was to study the impact of wide levees and narrow levees on the Yellow River. The results are very satisfactory. I also took advantage of the opportunity to participate in the experiment in Germany to exchange views on the river management issue with Professor Engels from time to time. As a result, it was found that Mr. Engels's proposition is actually the same principle as the river management method of Pan Jixun of the Ming Dynasty in our country, which communicates with each other, and it is also an unexpected gain of my trip. In addition to attending the road conference and participating in the Yellow River Experiment in Germany, I also visited the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and other countries with my wife, and I had a brief investigation on the water conservancy, municipal administration, and engineering education of each country. In addition to the investigation along the way, I have many feelings. In a nutshell, everyone is actively preparing for war."</p>
<p>League of Nations Secretary Wu Xiufeng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Fei Xindun Also Came to China on the Same Ship</p>
<p>League of Nations Secretary Dr. Wu Xiufeng recently came to Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Rosso for official business and arrived at the port at 2:30 PM yesterday.

<p>Director Wen Attended the Municipal Government Memorial Week and Completed the Inauguration Oath Ceremony</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Instructed Him to Protect the Interests of the People, and Director Wen Answered with Effort to Maintain Shanghai's Security</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Chaoji, the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau of this city, came to Shanghai at the end of last year and went to the bureau on New Year's Day to take office first. He attended the expanded memorial week at the Municipal Government yesterday morning and completed the inauguration oath ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Participating Personnel</h3>
<p>Those who participated in the ceremony included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director Wen Chaoji of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Secretary General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government, Director Li Tingan of the Health Bureau, Commissioners Wang Changchun and Luo Panhui, Secretaries Guo Shen, Geng Jiaqi, and Tang Shixuan, all staff of the Municipal Government, directors of various sub-bureaus of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, directors of various police stations, and guests Dong Chongshan, a representative of the High Court Second Branch; Shen Xiqing, President of the Local Court; Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs; Zeng Yiding, Commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy; Ye Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Guard Battalion; Pu Cheng, Staff Officer; Zhu Shaoping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Gazetteer, and over a hundred other people.</p>
<h3>Oath of Office</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the meeting was opened with a bell. All participants gathered in the auditorium. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a military band to play music on the spot. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony, and after performing the ritual, Mayor Wu gave a speech first, then Mayor Wu presided over the oath, Director Wen read the oath, and gave a reply, and then announced the completion of the ceremony and dismissal of the meeting. After the meeting, Secretary General Yu, Director Li, President Shen, and senior officials of the Municipal Government all shook hands with Director Wen to congratulate him.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Mayor Wu's speech briefly stated: "I am very grateful to the guests who came to participate today. I will take this opportunity to say a few words to Director Wen. National construction can be roughly divided into two types: political and economic. Whether it is political or economic construction, it is for the purpose of benefiting the people. If we want to succeed in economic construction, we should first work hard on political construction, because political construction is the driving force and engine of all construction. The most important thing in political construction is public security. Those of us who take the promotion of municipal construction as our duty want to enable the development of local undertakings and the people to sincerely help the government, then handling public security is even more important, because if public security is handled perfectly, the people will be able to live and work in peace, and all construction can be carried out actively. And the public security undertaking especially depends on whether the police can achieve effective results. If we want the police to achieve good results, we should lead by example, abide by the law, and take the protection of national rights and the interests of the people as our duty. Shanghai is an economic center, the gateway to the capital, and also a large international city. Therefore, those who come to China for sightseeing must first come to Shanghai, and the results of the police are the most obvious. Therefore, the management of the police should not be neglected in the slightest. I hope that Director Wen understands the importance of his responsibility, should never forget his duties, be able to abide by the laws and decrees of the country, obey the orders of his superiors, and take the protection of the interests of the people as important."</p>
<h3>Mr. Wen's Reply</h3>
<p>Director Wen's reply briefly stated: "Being ordered to serve as the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau of this city, I deeply know that the responsibility is heavy, and I should work hard for the public to avoid failing. In the future, I should be more self-motivated,恪遵Mayor's guidance, obey the orders of the government, and lead my subordinates to maintain the security of Shanghai, so as to promote the progress of the police administration in this city. I am especially grateful to the guests who have come to the scene."</p>
<h3>Bureau Chief's Oath</h3>
<p>Bureau Chief's Oath: [I, Wen Chaoji, hereby swear to恪 (respectfully) abide by the behests of the late Premier, uphold the Party's doctrines, observe the laws and regulations, be loyal and diligent in my duties. I resolve never to waste a single penny or misuse a single person, and I resolve never to engage in self-seeking corruption or accept bribes. Should I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This oath, Wen Chaoji, Bureau Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, January 7th, the 24th year of the Republic of China].</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee of the Pilots' Association Again Contends for Pilotage Sovereignty</p>
<p>The progress of our nation's recovery of pilotage rights is kept strictly confidential by the authorities, with all</p>
<p>news being unannounced, resembling the diplomatic approach of some nation's waterbirds. As a result, although the matter has appeared calm on the surface for months, secret negotiations have been quite tense. Since the recent publication in various newspapers of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilots' Association of this port, revealing the foreign opposition to the pilotage regulations and listing ten reasons for demanding revisions, exposing their conspiracy, and telegraphing the government to request a forceful defense, the inside story has been leaked, attracting public attention. Those concerned about national affairs are eager to learn more. Today, the reporter visited the association to conduct a conversation, and they recounted the situation, stating that our nation's pilotage rights between Tongsha and Shanghai have already been seized by foreigners, and the Chinese pilotage between Hankou and the Yangtze River is being suppressed by the Customs, not allowed to operate, and will soon follow the same disastrous path as Tongsha. This is because foreigners have a traditional plan to plot against us. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a foreigner named Tyler, in the name of the River Conservancy, presumptuously represented our country in granting the exclusive patent rights to the pilotage business from Tongsha to Shanghai to a foreign pilotage group, creating a situation where, in addition to our concessions, there is also the shadow of "renting water." Therefore, following the previous telegram, they again telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Central Party Headquarters to request their intervention, and showed the original telegram, stating that the Shen Xin Daily reported that the Japanese envoy had been coming to Beijing daily to negotiate the pilotage issue, met with President Wang, and held discussions for as long as two hours, with very detailed exchanges. The inner workings are not difficult to guess. It is noted that pilotage is related to national defense and also to politics, so all countries attach great importance to it. The former Qing Dynasty's Zongli Yamen officials were simply sinecures, and naturally did not understand this, so it is no surprise that they continuously relinquished rights everywhere. Even the general public lacks research on this matter, so after navigation rights and pilotage rights were surrendered, there were even fewer who came forward to advocate for remedies. Tracing back to the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign, Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, deceived the Zongli Yamen and approved the General Pilotage Regulations, so that all rights related to pilotage existed in name only but not in reality. Furthermore, since the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign (1907 AD), W.F. Tyler of the Shanghai River Conservancy</p>
<p>presumptuously represented our government and granted the exclusive patent rights for the Shanghai-Tongsha section to a foreign pilotage group in Shanghai, and allowed it to register in Hong Kong. Thus, China, in addition to the concessions, now also had "rented water." The above is only a brief account of the history of surrender. The most heartbreaking events were the Sino-French War in Minjiang, the Tianjin-Tanggu Incident, and the recent January 28th Incident, in which enemy warships were led into the port by pilots licensed by China. This is a rare and outrageous humiliation in the world. Past events are easily forgotten, but the January 28th Incident, then (titles omitted), from the Party's standpoint, was directly impacted. How could the association not be saddened by the inaction of the authorities and feel deeply about the folly of leaving the door wide open? As for the foreigners' excuse that pilotage is related to inland navigation rights, this is a completely unfounded fallacy. Not only has the association searched the treaties and found no basis for it, but many contemporary sages have also discussed and refuted its absurdity. With the sagacity of (titles omitted), who has a far-sighted perspective, why would the association need to cite numerous examples for him to finally realize? Even the only argument foreigners consider unassailable is the phrase "free employment of pilots" found in various treaties, which they use to oppose the recovery of pilotage rights. But it is well known that the treaty clearly states "free employment," which has been transformed into "free appointment." Isn't this the biggest joke in the world? Moreover, the General Pilotage Regulations approved by the former Qing Dynasty's Zongli Yamen were originally our country's internal affairs, and the government naturally has the right to change them at any time, as sovereignty dictates. Foreigners should not be able to interfere. However, since the government announced the Pilotage Management Regulations last September, the Inspector General of Customs</p>
<p>protested and demanded revisions. This is a clear demonstration of his contempt for the government and the traditional policy of imperialism. Subsequently, the consular corps opposed it, echoing each other, performing a farcical duet on the political stage. Finally, the envoys of various countries came out to bargain and reap the final victory. This is the political strategy of various countries in responding to our efforts to recover pilotage rights. Although the details of the Japanese envoy's discussions are not clear in the news, it is expected that they will not deviate from this pattern. How the government will navigate this situation is up to them. We will listen with respect. Since the Pilotage Management Regulations were announced and then protested and revised by the Inspector General of Customs, it has happened repeatedly, and each time, the opinions of foreigners are solicited first, which seems to have lost the autonomy of the system. Therefore, the content of the regulations is getting worse with each revision, so that the main points are essentially the same as the old regulations of the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign, merely a change of appearance without substance. For example, regarding the nationality of pilots, the old regulations of the former Qing Dynasty originally allowed both Chinese and foreigners to serve equally, but now, in response to foreigners, it is stipulated that the Chinese government is happy to employ them, with an explicit statement that foreigners can still be appointed. Although this sounds better on the surface, what is the difference in substance? Is this deceiving oneself or deceiving others? The association does not dare to say, but from the perspective of technicians, we believe that this approach is a fatal wound to our country's recovery of pilotage rights, and also a fatal wound to national defense and politics. Because if foreigners are allowed to continue serving as our country's pilots, then there will never be a recovery. Moreover, the government has not taken any action against the Japanese and Western pilotage groups in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and there are no restrictions on the entry and exit of ships over 5,000 tons. Although the dismantling of defenses did not begin today, the opening of the gates is more severe now than ever before. The association contemplates the future and trembles with fear. We also read President Wang's speech on peace and unity, which stated that the blood and sweat of the people should be used for national defense and external affairs. We believe that if the conditions for recovering pilotage rights are as bad as reported above, our country will be in a permanent state of being slaughtered. Even if the people shed blood and sweat, how will it flow? Furthermore, the late Premier created the Party and the nation, and his last words always regarded the overthrow of unequal treaties imposed by imperialists as the only policy for China's freedom and equality. Moreover, the National Government is a revolutionary government, and by definition, it should have revolutionary diplomacy. Is it pursuing revolutionary diplomacy on the issue of pilotage? The association's foolishness cannot fathom the depths. In the past year, we have repeatedly contributed our opinions to the government on the advantages and disadvantages of this matter, speaking with tears in our eyes, but there has been no response, as if the heavens are high and the earth is vast, and there is no way to appeal. Now, we venture to speak again, with the qualifications of citizens and the perspective of pilotage technology, and respectfully present two principles: (1) The nationality of pilots, no matter what, can only be Chinese; (2) All foreign pilots must be completely eliminated within five years, or at most ten years, and no longer employed. With this goal in mind, everyone from the head of state to the citizens should sacrifice their sincerity, dedication and enthusiasm. If this cannot be achieved, then any form of deception is like a country like this. Can it stand in today's competitive world? Should it be in (titles omitted). The association's alarmist words may be inappropriate for the times, and we know that we are guilty, but the situation is urgent and the enemies are deep, so it is difficult to remain silent. We are telegraphing in fear, awaiting instructions. Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilots' Association.</p>

<p>Those who need samples of [Hu Su Er] asthma medicine and detailed instructions for the radical cure of asthma, please write to the Shanghai Jiujiang Road No. 150 Foreign Building, Huashang Fu Ying Pharmacy, and they will be sent immediately.</p>
<p>The marriage advertisement published in this newspaper previously was intended to promote a unique and effective medicine for asthma, namely [Hu Su Er] asthma medicine. The use of "marriage advertisement" as a title was to attract the attention of readers. Now, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, a detailed explanation is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Luo Lun is not a person's name, but the name of the Luo Lun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory located in [Aisen City], Germany. The factory manufactures the asthma medicine [Hu Su Er], English name (FELSOL).</p>
<p>(2) There is no [Qi Ji Ping] University in Germany. [Qi Ji Ping] is a translation of [Qi Ji Bing] (asthma).</p>
<p>(3) Luo Lun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical factories, with a very large scale, rich assets, and a famous reputation throughout Germany.</p>
<p>(4) [Hu Su Er] asthma medicine has been in China for eight years. It is now exclusively managed by Huashang Fu Ying Pharmacy, and its sales cover the entire China. It is extremely effective in treating various heart and chronic bronchitis, cough, and asthma. Whether in the military, political, decision-making, or academic fields, all those who suffer from asthma consider it the only good companion.</p>
<p>(1) [Hu Su Er] asthma medicine is exclusively managed by Shanghai Huashang Fu Ying Pharmacy, and most of those who take it are Chinese, hence the mention of Chinese nationality.</p>
<p>(2) The age is specified as 18 to 30 years old because this period is the youth and prime of life, and various heart diseases are most likely to occur, or those in the academic field who do strenuous exercise may suffer from palpitations and shortness of breath, and should take [Hu Su Er] asthma medicine to be effective.</p>

<h3>Directorate General of Posts Scheduled to Move to Beijing</h3>
<p>Detention of Private Letters Is Actually a Misunderstanding; Mail Service to Recovered Bandit Areas is Smooth</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The move of the Directorate General of Posts to Beijing was originally scheduled to begin on December 12th of last year, but was postponed to the winter vacation due to the issue of schooling for the children of employees. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited the Director of General Affairs of the Directorate General, Zhu Menghou, who said,</p>
<h3>Directorate General Moves to Beijing</h3>
<p>It has now been decided that the relocation will be completed within three days, starting on the 17th of this month. Currently, documents and other items have been prepared. A total of 140 employees of the department, plus their families, totaling about 300 to 400 people, will also go to Beijing during these three days. The Directorate General will resume normal operations in the capital on Monday, the 21st. As for the</p>
<h3>Detention of Private Letters</h3>
<p>In fact, this is a misunderstanding. The post office is only acting in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. All private letters sent before December 31st of the 23rd year will not be detained. However, after being sent by the sending post office to the destination post office, that post office will notify the private letter offices to send personnel to the post office to supervise the opening of the package and verify the number of letters. The post office will then deliver the letters to each household on their behalf, and after the delivery is completed, each letter will have a receipt stamped and returned to the private letter offices, free of charge, for verification. However, from January 1st of this year, if the post office discovers private letters again, they will all be detained, and if necessary, they will be punished according to the law for privately delivering letters and infringing on the national postal service.</p>
<h3>Decline of Private Letter Offices</h3>
<p>It began early with the development of the postal service. If private letter offices relied solely on delivering letters, they would not have been able to survive long ago, even before the Ministry's order to abolish private letter offices, they would have been running around appealing. The most developed areas for private letter offices in the past were Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and their main source of income was transferring silver and foreign goods for customers. As for letters, the benefits were very small. The post office charges five cents for ordinary letters weighing no more than 20 grams, while private letter offices collect letters to a certain place, pack them into a bundle, and then hand them over to the post office to pay according to the weight. The benefit is only on the number of letters weighing less than 20 grams, which is very small. Currently, the Ministry's order to abolish private letters only applies to [letters]. Other original ancillary businesses, such as transferring silver and foreign goods, can continue to operate. Moreover, there are very few letters sent by private letter offices now, so the impact on private letter offices is not significant.</p>
<h3>Postal Issues</h3>
<p>Already resolved by commercial negotiation and will begin on the 10th. As each area of the bandit region is recovered, a post office will be established to forward letters. Therefore, the forwarding of mail from recovered bandit areas is now unhindered.</p>
<p>Restoration of the Siberian Postal Route</p>
<p>The Post Office has notified the Universal Postal Union</p>
<p>The Siberian Postal Route was suspended after the postal service in Northeast China was discontinued, causing delays. Mail from our country to Europe took more than a month for faster deliveries and almost two months for slower ones. It is now reported that the Post Office has notified the Universal Postal Union, stating that, in light of the resolutions of the League of Nations' Advisory Committee, and to reduce the delays in communication between China and Europe and the United States, the previously suspended postal route has been restored. All procedures will be handled as before.</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Huang Fusheng Cables the Central Government to Send Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Hoping for the unanimous support of fellow Sichuanese. Central Committee Member Huang Fusheng, of the Shanghai Sichuanese Association and a Supervisory Committee member, was previously dispatched to Sichuan to inspect party affairs. Observing the rampant bandits in Sichuan and fearing the spread of the communist scourge, endangering the party and the nation, he specifically cabled the Central Government, requesting the swift dispatch of a large army to Sichuan to suppress the bandits. He also cabled fellow natives in Shanghai, urging their unanimous support to realize this goal. The original text is as follows: To the Shanghai Sichuanese Association, Gentlemen: I recently sent a cable to the Nationalist Government’s Executive Yuan Military Affairs Commission, stating: "Having been ordered to return to Sichuan to inspect party affairs, it is my duty to comply. However, seeing the communist flames filling the sky, the cries of distress echoing across the land, the hearts of the people in turmoil, and danger lurking everywhere, I am deeply concerned about the future. Therefore, not avoiding the appearance of overstepping my bounds, I present my humble opinion, to express my limited views, to the government. The communist bandits’ invasion of Sichuan was initially weak, with only a few thousand men and guns, causing disturbances only in the border areas. However, following the outbreak of the Sichuanese civil war, the bandit forces secretly grew. One misstep led to a great expansion. Now they are eyeing the Fu River, invading Youyang and Pengshui, and important towns and cities are falling one after another. The fire is spreading, and the opportunity for defense is becoming increasingly urgent. Both Sichuan provinces are in turmoil and unrest. Secret uprisings are frequently heard, and bandits are rising up in droves. Those with resources are packing up and moving their families out of the province, while those without resources are wandering aimlessly on the streets, crying out without any hope, a truly unbearable sight. These are all the people nurtured by our government, yet they unexpectedly find themselves trapped in this abyss of misery. Counting the times that the army has engaged with the bandits, for the past two years, the Sichuanese army, with 300,000 troops, has repeatedly encircled them, but the bandits, with only a few thousand remnants, have struggled against them, rotating in battles, but instead being taken advantage of. Recently suffering another defeat, the bandit forces have become even stronger. Supplies of rations and ammunition are difficult to replenish, and the soldiers are unable to get a full meal. The army is old and exhausted, and in a precarious situation. If they wish to succeed, they fear it will be hopeless. Furthermore, hearing that the bandits who broke out of Jiangxi, passed through the rugged and dangerous areas of southern Hunan, traversing two or three thousand miles, as if traveling through uninhabited territory, were able to safely occupy the border of Guizhou. This momentum is frightening, even stronger than when Xu bandits entered Sichuan. However, the current military strength of Guizhou province is weaker than that of the Sichuan army in the past. If they are not quickly eliminated before their wings are fully formed, and delayed repeatedly, they will again grow in strength, and accumulate into a second Sichuan that will be difficult to clean up. If they further unite with He Long and Xu Xiangqian's bandits into one force, then the Sichuan and Guizhou provinces will become a bandit den. Further, if they annex Yunnan, and occupy Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou as their fundamental nest, then taking advantage of the overwhelming momentum, they will peer into the Yangtze River, and China's future will truly be lost forever. I have silently observed the overall situation, and considered it thoroughly. At this critical moment, and with the people's earnest hopes, I can only beseech our government, to think of the west, to swiftly transfer elite troops from Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei provinces to Sichuan to suppress the bandits in separate directions, and also to swiftly transfer elite troops from Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, to jointly encircle the Guizhou army on all sides, to avoid joining forces with the Sichuan bandits, leading to an irredeemable situation. Furthermore, the government should appoint a knowledgeable military official to control the six provinces' supporting armies, enter Sichuan to supervise and lead the joint encirclement and suppression, and strive for practical results. As for the financial aspect, if the excessive and harsh taxes and levies, and the unrestricted issuance of paper money, two policies regarding currency, are not immediately stopped, and a method of relief is not found, then the good people in the non-bandit areas will be forced to take risks and seek a way out. They will also be forced to become bandits. Even if the supporting armies gather, the chaos in Sichuan will still have no hope of being cleared. I can only beseech the government to start from the political aspect, to quickly plan a fundamental relief strategy, to ensure that administration is staffed by competent people, so that corruption can be reduced, and the people's distress can be alleviated. Do everything to reverse what the leaders of Sichuan are currently doing, to rescue the people from the brink of disaster, and bring them to a place of peace. If we can do this, we will surely achieve the complete pacification and cleansing, without any worries or repercussions. The government previously said that the bandits in Jiangxi had not yet been pacified, so it had no time to look west. Now that the bandit lairs are about to be destroyed, the large army can move west, to relieve the people of Sichuan from complete inversion, and drive out the communist atmosphere from outside the borders. It is up to our government to make a decisive decision and save these common people. Now the people of Sichuan are drowning in misery, eagerly hoping for governance. They are preparing baskets of food and pots of drinks, both women and children are ready. It is easy to imagine that the hearts of the people are leaning towards the national army. Moreover, the Sichuan army has been defeated repeatedly, its morale has been crushed, its steps are not uniform, and its people have no goals. The national army acts as the rear guard, supervising and ordering the vanguard, not only achieving the effect of unified command, but also boosting the already weakened morale of the Sichuan army. The opportunity is ripe, with no need for hesitation. These are my urgent words, I beseech you to consider and quickly implement them. I am waiting anxiously for your orders." Please advocate for unanimous support, in order to realize this goal. Huang Fusheng bows reverently.</p>
<p>The Fourth Group of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Representatives of the Twenty-Third Petitioning Group Return to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth group of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, consisting of one person, Wang Dechang, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 6th on the Japanese ship Rokko Maru. The ship docked at the Huishan Wharf. After disembarking, the refugee went to the Lao Gong Xin Zhan inn on the 16th Pu to stay. Due to financial difficulties, he urgently needs relief from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau. The reporter from the Daily News also learned that the twenty-fourth group of overseas Chinese totaled eight people. The remaining seven people were from Shandong, so they took a Japanese ship directly to Qingdao to disembark. In addition, after the twenty-third group of overseas Chinese, Zheng Yuanchi, Yao Yongyin, and others, arrived in Shanghai, although the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau issued each person a relief payment of five yuan, these overseas Chinese were members of the Revolutionary Party, so they recently sent Zheng Yuanchi as a representative to Nanjing, to report everything to the Central Party Headquarters, and to request an increase in relief funds. The representative has completed his mission in Nanjing and is scheduled to return to Beijing today.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs on Methods for Affixing Revenue Stamps to Account Books</p>
<p>At the latest, should begin on February 1st, and continue to affix revenue stamps at one dime each according to the regulations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the annual replacement and affixing of revenue stamps, issued a notice to all industry guilds in the city, saying, "Gentlemen: We recently received a letter from the Sauce Garden Industry Guild stating that the new Stamp Tax Law has been amended and promulgated, stipulating that each account book must be affixed with two dimes. If a new account book is used, should revenue stamps still be affixed according to the old regulations, or should they be affixed according to the new Stamp Tax Law? Please investigate and respond. "An investigation of Article 24 of the Stamp Tax Law states that the date of implementation of this law shall be determined by order. This new Stamp Tax Law is different from other laws that take effect immediately upon promulgation. Although the new Stamp Tax Law was promulgated by order of the Nationalist Government on December 8, 1934, according to the provisions of Article 24 of the law, the current Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations have not yet become invalid. All account books should still be affixed with a new revenue stamp of one dime each, according to the current regulations, which is not illegal. If, during the year 1935, the new Stamp Tax Law is separately ordered to take effect on a specific date, then the one-dime revenue stamp currently affixed to the new account book, whether or not it is necessary to affix two dimes at that time, according to Article 23 of the new Stamp Tax Law, the implementing rules of this law shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance, so we can wait for the implementing rules to be stipulated at that time, to determine the standard for whether or not to supplement the stamp. It is not a problem now. "Furthermore, according to a letter from the Travel Industry Guild, most merchants are accustomed to using the end of the lunar year as the end of the accounting period. Now that the end of the solar year has passed, and the end of the lunar year has not yet arrived, should revenue stamps be re-affixed to the old account books already affixed with stamps during this transitional period, or can they be affixed after the books are closed and replaced? Please advise." An investigation of the telegram from the Executive Yuan in May 1931 states: "According to the joint report of the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Communications, Railways, and Industry, regarding the resolution of the National Merchants' Accounting Date, the 23rd State Council Meeting decided that the end of January of the solar calendar shall be the general collection and settlement period. Such regulations are consistent with the usual time of year and are also aligned with the originally set collection periods at the end of May and the end of September, each being four months apart, and are considered to be evenly distributed." This association notified on June 6, 1931. The period for settling accounts at the end of the year has been determined by the Executive Yuan to be the end of January of the following solar year. Revenue stamps for account books should be replaced and affixed no later than February 1st of each year, to comply with the general collection and settlement period stipulated by the Executive Yuan. Many people in Shanghai affix revenue stamps to their account books according to the lunar calendar, resulting in being penalized for being overdue. All guilds must notify their members not to repeat the same mistakes. "The above two issues are related to more than one industry, so we are issuing separate notices to all, hoping that you will pay attention and pass them on to your members, etc."</p>

<p>The Joint Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association Conducts Joint Investigation for Emergency Relief in Yixing</p>
<p>The Joint Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association, together with the World Red Cross, the Catholic Action Society, and other charitable organizations, is conducting relief efforts in Liyang, which have been completed. They then set off with all the cooperating personnel to Yixing, to conduct an investigation for emergency relief. The association recently received a report from the relief workers it sent out, stating that although Yixing is a disaster area, the disaster is severe, and relief cannot be delayed. According to the report, the entire county has eight districts. In districts four, five, six, and seven, the farmland has yielded no harvest, and the disaster victims have suffered greatly, with no means of making a living. Now that the new year has arrived, there are cries of distress and hunger everywhere, and the situation is extremely dire. Many have fled to neighboring counties to find food. Although the disaster situation in districts one, two, three, and eight is relatively lighter, there are still some who must be given relief. Currently, all the investigation and relief workers went to district six on the 5th of this month to distribute relief tickets. It is estimated that the investigation in the entire county can be completed within two weeks. Once the investigation is completed, relief will be distributed immediately. At present, there are only 13,500 bags of flour. Unfortunately, the disaster area is large and there is little food, which is still insufficient. If all sectors can provide assistance, it is hoped that those who have no means of making a living will not be left without any aid.</p>

<p>Investigation of Leprosy Work in Various Places</p>
<p>Wu Zhijian Returns Home Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhijian, the general director of the China Leprosy Relief Association, was invited by the National Leprosy Relief Institute of the United States last June to give a speech on the leprosy situation in China. He departed the country at the beginning of August last year. At the same time, the Nanjing Health Department took advantage of Wu's trip abroad and specially asked him to investigate the leprosy work in Japan, Hawaii, North and South America, and other places. Mr. Wu has completed his official duties after more than four months abroad and returned to China yesterday morning. The reporter met with him at his office yesterday and learned about the leprosy situation in various places in detail. He said that after he went abroad, he first went to Japan, staying for three weeks, and went to Takamatsu, Osaka, and other places to visit the Japanese National Leprosy Sanatorium. The buildings were very good, and the equipment was also good. It can accommodate two or three patients, and treat different types of leprosy, such as nerve leprosy and skin leprosy. In addition, the children of patients are separated, and a special educational institution like a school is established to accommodate their children, teaching them life skills so that they can be self-reliant in the future. Married couples who have been specially permitted can live together, but are not allowed to have children. There are seven larger facilities nationwide, with annual operating expenses of 2 to 3 million Japanese yen, all of which are paid by the national treasury. The United States is even better, with its largest national leprosy sanatorium requiring 600,000 to 700,000 gold dollars each year. The thoughtfulness of its facilities and the generosity of its treatment are even better than those of an average Chinese family. It provides whatever the patients need as much as possible. There is a volleyball and golf course in the sanatorium. Each patient's room has a radio, but the patients are still dissatisfied. He also visited North and South America, lecturing extensively. He returned home via Honolulu and other places. The facilities were all good, and the expenses were borne by the national or provincial and municipal authorities. On the other hand, our country has more leprosy patients than any other country, but there are no large-scale sanatoriums to prevent the spread of the disease. From my personal observations, if we want to eliminate this disease, we must have national power. As for the sanatorium planned by our association, it could have been built earlier, but the drawings were changed several times and have not yet been finalized. The funds raised, including those from Hu Wenhu, are estimated to be about 100,000. The site has been surveyed near the Dadongchang area, and the bidding for construction can be started no later than the middle of next month. It is expected to be completed in about half a year, and it is expected to accommodate more than 300 patients.</p>
<p>White Russians Celebrate Christmas Yesterday</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the 18,000 White Russians in Shanghai celebrated Christmas from today (the 7th) according to the old Russian calendar. According to the old Russian calendar, Christmas and New Year celebrations are thirteen days later than the dates commonly used elsewhere in the world. Since the Russian Revolution in 1917, the old calendar has been abolished, but White Russians who have fled abroad still adhere to it. Yesterday was the eve of the White Russian Christmas. The Shanghai Russian Regiment held a review ceremony at the shooting range at 10 a.m. The Director-General of the Municipal Council, Arnold, attended the ceremony and received the regiment's salute, and awarded the shooting prizes to the various teams and soldiers. Russian churches will hold prayer services today and yesterday. Furthermore, various White Russian organizations will hold celebrations in the coming days. Avenue Joffre is the center of the White Russian residential area. Yesterday, White Russian men and women were buying goods in various shops on the road. Russian shops will be closed today, and Russian newspapers will also stop publishing.</p>
<p>Travel Savings Continues to Give Away Travel Magazines</p>
<p>The travel savings offered by the Shanghai Bank at 589 Avenue Joffre has been available for half a year. Because the bank has received enthusiastic account openings from all walks of life, it is specially giving away travel magazines to increase customers' interest in saving. The original plan to provide this kind of preferential treatment was until the end of 1934. Recently, there have been even more account openings. The bank has specially extended the period for giving away travel magazines. Those who open an account this year will still be able to enjoy this treatment.</p>
<p>The Guanghua Medical and Pharmaceutical Magazine Establishes a Branch in the Philippines</p>

It has now reached Volume 2, Issue 2. The content is rich and it is sold at home and abroad, and is well received. There are more than 100 branches, all of which are organized by enthusiastic people in the medical and pharmaceutical industry. Recently, the Philippine government cracked down on Chinese medicine in that city. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in the Philippines were outraged and specially elected the chief representative of the Chinese Medicine Association of the Philippines, Lu Liping, to return to China to petition the government and the Central National Medical Center in Beijing. The Guanghua Medical and Pharmaceutical Magazine has recorded the various situations in great detail. Representative Lu was deeply grateful that the magazine could maintain an upright and unbiased stance. Therefore, Mr. Lu came to Shanghai to contact the magazine to establish a branch on the island of the Philippines, in order to promote Chinese medical and pharmaceutical culture. Representative Lu has now returned to the Philippines and the branch will be established soon.</p>
<p>Records of the Lingnan Sports Association's Social Gathering</p>

<p>Huge Sum of Money Detained by Tongshan County Is Returned</p>
<p>A certain grain merchant in this city, in order to purchase miscellaneous grains, specially appointed Lu and Wang to go to the Xu and Hai districts to purchase soybeans and other items and transport them to Shanghai for sale, bringing with them more than 10,000 silver dollars. When they reached Tongshan County, the local county police detained the money because it violated the central government's ban on exceeding the amount of money that could be carried. Lu and Wang were also taken to the county jail for detention. Later, with the help of a leader in the miscellaneous grain industry in this city, Sheng Yi, requested Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send a telegram to the director of the Longhai Railway Money Bureau, requesting that the magistrate of Tongshan County quickly release the two freight agents and the money used to purchase goods. After the telegram was sent, this city received a reply telegram from the director of the Longhai Railway Money Bureau yesterday, stating that, according to a letter from Magistrate Wang of Tongshan County, since it had been proven that the money carried by Lu and Wang was used for the purpose of purchasing goods, they had been released and the money had been returned to them.</p>

<h3>Major Theft Case at Chung Foo Bank</h3>
<p>Electrician Secretly Made Extra Safe Keys with Premeditation</p>
<p>Stole Over 20,000 Yuan While Working During Leave</p>
<p>丨Hu Honglai and Two Others Apprehended in Zhenjiang丨</p>
<h3>Opening the Safe</h3>
<p>Hu Honglai, from Anhui, residing at No. 11, Kanglai Lane, Kangnau Road, had been employed as a coppersmith and electrician at the Chung Foo Bank at No. 103, Nanking Road. In July of the previous year, Jiang Shaosheng, the bank's manager, had Hu make a replacement key for the silver box storing the safe deposit keys, as the original was damaged. Unexpectedly, Hu, harboring malicious intentions, secretly made an extra key while making the replacement and hid it, waiting for a suitable opportunity for his illegal activities. Last year, when the bank was open for business, and there was a light fixture that needed fixing, Hu did not go to work at the bank. When the bank was open for business, and there was a light fixture that needed fixing, Hu immediately went to the bank to repair it, seeing an opportunity. He then recruited Ningbo natives Sun Ruifu and Wang Xiaohua to the bank. Using the key he had made, they stole the safe deposit keys from the manager's office and then stole 21,000 yuan in silver dollars from the vault before fleeing. They divided the loot and spent it. At the time, Hu thought that this matter was unknown to anyone, so he fled. Unexpectedly, last month, Hu's wife, Zhang Xiuhua, went to Ningbo for personal reasons, where detectives from the Public Security Bureau found a handgun in her luggage, leading to her detention by the local court. Upon hearing this news, Hu, fearing exposure, fled to Nanjing with Sun Ruifu on the eleventh of last month. In Nanjing, they met Shi Haiquan, from Dongtai, who notified Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Tense</h3>
<p>They then fled to Wuxi, and later to Zhenjiang. While Hu and the others were fleeing, their accomplice, Wang Xiaohua, was arrested on Guangdong Road by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Chinese Detective Liu Shaokui of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Station. 425 yuan in stolen money was found, and he was handed over to the First Special District Court, sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Meanwhile, Inspector Lu learned that Hu and the other two were hiding in room 34 of the Dahua Hotel at No. 2, Erma Road in Zhenjiang. He then ordered Chinese Detectives Wu Hanzhang and Chen Yonggui to go to Zhenjiang with official documents, where they cooperated with the Public Security Bureau to arrest Hu Honglai, Sun Ruifu, and Shi Haiquan at 4:00 PM on the fifth of this month.</p>
<h3>Brought Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>57 yuan was found on the three suspects, and 985 yuan in stolen silver dollars were recovered from the home of Sun Qian's uncle, Sun Gansheng, at No. 13, Tongzhou Road. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police attorney Wang Yaotang filed charges against them under Article 338 of the Criminal Code, stating that it was found that Hu Honglai had sent 4,700 yuan of the stolen money to his home in Shouzhou, northern Anhui. Sun Ruifu used the large sum of money</p>
<h3>Marrying a Woman</h3>
<p>(Currently residing at No. 15, Lane 488, Avenue Road,) As for the stolen money, it is still necessary to collect it from various places. Therefore, a request has been made to postpone this case, and to request the local court to bring Wang Xiuhua in order to investigate the stolen funds, etc. When questioned, Hu Honglai and Sun Ruifu confessed to jointly stealing and each receiving 8,000 yuan, while Wang Xiaohua received 2,500 yuan. The remaining 2,500 yuan was used jointly, etc. Shi Haiquan confessed to providing information without reservation. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and the trial postponed for one week.</p>
<p>The Journalists' Association Holds an Emergency Meeting Today</p>
<p>To Aid Those Dismissed from the Shih Pao (The Eastern Times)</p>
<p>The Shih Pao suddenly dismissed over thirty employees last Lunar New Year's Eve. The Shanghai Journalists' Association, upon the request of its members who had been dismissed from the Shih Pao, decided to provide assistance. The association immediately convened an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss the countermeasures. It was resolved to form a committee of seven members, including He Xiya, Zhu Ping'an, Yuan Xiaoyi, Jin Xiongbai, Qian Han Shuo, Hang Shijun, Du Gang, etc., to handle the matter. The committee then appointed Hang, Zhu, Yuan, and Qian as representatives of the association to negotiate reinstatement with Zhang Zhuping, the general manager of the Shih Pao. After two rounds of negotiations, no satisfactory result was achieved. The association has scheduled another emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for today (the 8th) at 4:30 PM at the association's headquarters. The four representatives will report on the progress of their negotiations with Zhang Zhuping and discuss the future direction of the case.</p>
<p>The Concession's Water Company Will Collect Deposit Fees Starting This Year</p>
<p>Friction Will Likely Increase in the Future</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, due to the impact of the global recession and rural bankruptcy, the living environment of Shanghai citizens is deteriorating. Various groups have organized movements to reduce rents. Landlords have not agreed to these requests, citing the lack of explicit provisions in rent reduction laws. While a few landlords have agreed to reductions, the central business district remains unchanged. Therefore, tenants have been passively accumulating rent arrears, and landlords are helpless. Although they can sue in court, it is too cumbersome. Traditionally, the cost of tap water installed in the houses has been collected and paid by the landlords. Due to the accumulated rent arrears, landlords have also delayed paying water bills. The British Shanghai Water Company, considering that the procedures for collecting water fees would become too burdensome and the losses too great, has decided to require a deposit for all tap water pipes, whether newly installed or already existing, starting in January of this year. The deposit amount will be based on the size of the house and the amount of water used. If water bills are not paid on time and the water usage exceeds the deposit amount, users will be notified to pay the fees. Otherwise, the water supply will be cut off according to regulations. This is similar to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's practice of installing electric meters. However, while this measure may prevent losses for the water company, future disputes over water cutoffs will increase.</p>
<p>Dissolution of Cooperation</p>
<p>Sanbei Company's New Ships Provoke Opposition from Other Companies in the Alliance</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's new ship, the Mingxing, has been rebuilt and is scheduled to start running to Zhenhai tomorrow, also navigating to Ningbo, realizing the planned route. However, Taikoo, China Merchants, Ningshao, and other companies on the same route, which have been in an alliance for business cooperation to eliminate competition, now face a problem with the launch of the Mingxing regarding the existing cooperation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Alliance for Several Years</p>
<p>For the past five or six years, Taikoo, China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningshao have formed an alliance on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, dividing the Ningbo route into 42.5 shares. Taikoo's Xinbei took 11 shares, Ningshao's Xin Ningshao took 11 shares, China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian took 10.5 shares, and Sanbei's Yongxing took 10 shares. Since then, the four companies have been sincere with each other, supplementing surpluses and deficits. In the past two years, Sanbei's Yongxing has been subsidized annually, while Taikoo, Ningshao, China Merchants, and other ships have all been subsidized. Since the formation of the alliance, all four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route have had profits.</p>
<p>New Ship Route</p>
<p>Although Sanbei's Mingxing's route is the Shanghai-Ningbo line, Zhenhai is the main port and Ningbo becomes a secondary port. Therefore, a special pier was built in Zhenhai. The Mingxing's business focuses on loading and transporting goods from Zhenhai. As Zhenhai serves as an inland port, goods transported from Shanghai to Zhenhai and from Zhenhai to Shanghai can be declared at the South Gate for export and can be exempted from customs duties. From now on, cotton and tea from Ningbo transported to Shanghai can also be loaded on ships in Zhenhai and exempted from taxes.</p>
<p>Difficult to Continue Cooperation</p>
<p>Taikoo, China Merchants, and Ningshao have expressed opposition to adding ships to the Shanghai-Ningbo route due to the launch of the Mingxing. According to the current business situation, the four companies can barely maintain the status quo if they continue to operate according to the original agreement. Now, with the addition of a new ship, one company cannot enjoy the benefits of two ships being subsidized. Therefore, Taikoo, China Merchants, and Ningshao have not convened discussions to renew the alliance agreement for this year. In fact, cooperation is difficult, and the alliance will be dissolved after the Mingxing starts operating.</p>
<p>Competition and Bargaining</p>
<p>In the coastal shipping routes, the Ningbo route has been the most successful in terms of unity and the most stable in terms of freight rates. In recent years, ships on the Dinghai, Tongyang, Chongsha, and Beiyang routes have competed and cooperated, benefiting significantly in business. However, after the launch of the Mingxing, according to various companies, the breakdown of the alliance will inevitably lead to fierce competition on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Ningbo now has six ships: Xin Beijing, Xin Ningshao, Xin Jiangtian, Yongxing, Mingxing, and Hongxing. With more ships than cargo, a price war and competitive bidding are inevitable.</p>
<p>Oujiang River Gradually Silting Up Making Navigation Difficult for Ocean Vessels</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Plans to Move Wharf. Porters Petition for Dredging of Wenzhou Oujiang Port. Over the years, due to mountain torrents and mudslides, the Oujiang River has gradually silted up, severely impacting navigation. The China Merchants Bureau plans to relocate the wharf. The porters' association in the port city is alarmed, concerned that thousands of livelihoods are at stake. They have sent telegrams to various parties requesting dredging. This matter is of great importance. Recent information is detailed below:</p>
<p>Ocean Vessels Find it Difficult to Enter the Port</p>
<p>On the Wenzhou route, only the China Merchants Bureau dispatches the regular ocean vessel Hai'an. The Nan Shi Lian An Shipping Bureau's Yili also calls there on occasion. Other vessels are shallow-draft wooden hulled ships. In recent months, the Oujiang River in Wenzhou has experienced increased silting due to mountain torrents and mudslides, making the river shallower. At low tide, the draft is very small, only five or six feet. Therefore, ocean vessels from Shanghai to Wenzhou often have to wait for the tide and cannot enter the inner harbor to dock if they carry heavy cargo. Vessel entry and exit are very difficult.</p>
<p>Proposal to Relocate the Wharf</p>
<p>The Wenzhou branch of the China Merchants Bureau has found it increasingly inconvenient to load and unload cargo and passengers. Moreover, the original wharf is gradually silting up, making navigation difficult during low tide. Therefore, it has petitioned the head office to find a solution and relocate the wharf to a deeper area, allowing cargo to be loaded and unloaded without obstruction. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the situation is as described. After discussion, they propose relocating the Wenzhou wharf to the vicinity of Zhuangyuan Bridge and building a new wharf, which would be a permanent solution. This project is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Porters' Great Panic</p>
<p>After this event, the Wenzhou Porters and Dockworkers Union panicked. If the Oujiang River continues to silt up without dredging, it will indeed block navigation. If the wharves are relocated elsewhere, the thousands of porters and workers who depend on them for their livelihood will be deprived of their income. It would also lead to a repeat of the severe drought that occurred during the Daoguang era. Therefore, they have presented the pros and cons and requested the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau to oversee the dredging of the Oujiang River and prevent the relocation of the wharves.</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Swift Dredging</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has forwarded this petition to the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that they quickly dispatch technicians to the Oujiang River to measure and dredge the silted areas as soon as possible to prevent the blockage of the waterway. In addition, the ministry will consult with the Construction Committee to discuss the dredging work on the Oujiang River, aiming to complete it in the shortest possible time. The matter of relocating the wharves will be decided after further investigation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Trainee Goes Missing Family Fears Mistaken Kidnapping</p>
<p>Zhang Zhe'an from Wuxi, who previously ran a silk factory and resides at No. 273 Zhangjiazhai, Kachien Road, has a third son named Guangzao, who is nineteen years old. He is a trainee at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. He is mature for his age and highly valued in the bank. During the New Year holiday, he went to the Star Theater at 2 PM on the 2nd but did not return late at night. His family was anxious and searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. After several days, with no news, they suspect that he may have been mistakenly kidnapped. His father, Zhe'an, has been in dire straits recently, unemployed for more than ten years and struggling to make ends meet. His son would not be a target for kidnapping. However, it is rumored that a certain Mr. Zhang, also from Wuxi, has received threatening letters. It happens that Mr. Zhang's family also went out at 2 PM on the same day. They are of similar age and appearance, and share the same surname and hometown. It is feared that there may have been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Girl Runs Away From Home and is Seduced by a Rogue</p>
<p>The Public Conveys Findings. Indecent Assault. Public Trial Forbidden</p>
<p>Zhenjiang woman Zhu Ding, resident of No. 341 Xin Jiang Road, Zhabei District, works at the Jardine Matheson Packing Factory on North Suzhou Road. Recently, her husband passed away and she instructed her daughter, Laiying, to stay home and take care of the household. However, Laiying, who is only fifteen years old, is still childlike and often goes out to play. When her mother found out, she scolded her. In a fit of anger, Laiying secretly left home without saying goodbye at around 6 PM on the 5th. She wandered around the old Garbage Bridge area on North Suzhou Road and met a rogue fellow townsman, Zhu Youming (29 years old, residing at No. 31 Dingxingli, North Sichuan Road). Seeing her loitering on the street, he inquired and learned the whole story. Realizing that Laiying was young and easily deceived, he enticed her with sweet words and took her to the Yuanxing Inn at No. 52 North Sichuan Road, Room 4. He raped her using force. However, because she was forced, she argued with him afterwards, which was overheard by Chinese detectives Yang Zhaoqing and Bao Liu Shaotian of the Joint Savings Society Public Conveyance. They immediately arrested Zhu Youming and brought him and Zhu Laiying to the Public Conveyance. The head of the Public Conveyance ordered Zhu Youming to be detained and sent the girl to the Shanghai Sanitarium for examination, which confirmed the rape. Her mother, Zhu Ding, was notified to take her home. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special District Court. Public Conveyance lawyer Zhang Tianyin charged Zhu Youming with rape under Article 240, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and Article 315, restricting freedom. The court declared the case to be indecent and forbade spectators. Judge Liu then questioned him until noon and ordered a postponement. The defendant was taken back to the Public Conveyance for detention.</p>
<p>Chen Xinfa Dies Suspiciously Body Turns Blue and Foams at the Mouth</p>
<p>His Wife Ding Confesses to Having an Affair Case is Confusing, Bizarre, and Extremely Complex</p>
<p>Chen Xinfa, a local resident of Yangjing Town, Pudong, married Ding in the eleventh month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (lunar calendar). They had a good relationship for over a year. Chen originally did odd jobs at home. It wasn't until the thirteenth day of the tenth month of this year (lunar calendar) that he was recommended by a friend to work at the Pinghu Electric Light Plant. However, Ding was young and attractive, and was coveted by others, leading to an affair. Chen returned to Shanghai on the 23rd of last month (lunar calendar), and the couple was as good as new. On the 29th, they went to Puxi together. Chen sent his wife to her relatives' house to collect a field deed, and then Chen also went to visit a friend. They both returned home that night. The next morning, a sudden incident occurred. Chan asked his wife to boil water for him to drink, but she stayed in bed. By noon, his face had changed dramatically. Ding asked him what was wrong, but he was unable to speak. He died at 4 PM. The day before yesterday at noon, Ding, along with her husband's older sister's couple, Zhang Xingtao and Zhang Chen, reported to the Yangjing Police Station that Chen's cause of death was unknown and requested an investigation. Chief Zhan sent officers to investigate and found that the deceased's body was blue all over and foamed at the mouth, suggesting that he had been murdered. Ding was questioned to find clues. According to Ding, fifteen or sixteen days after her husband went to Pinghu, her husband's cousin, Chen Zhangying, came to her house and insisted on sleeping with her. Because she was alone at home, she did not object. After sleeping together for three days, Zhangying suddenly brought three unknown young men, all speaking the local dialect. One of the young men was about twenty-seven or eight years old, of medium height, with a square, white face, wearing a yellow coat, a yellow satin cotton robe, and a yellow felt hat. He raped me all night. Zhangying and the other two slept on the floor. They dispersed the next day. When my husband returned to Shanghai, I told him about this, but he did not say anything. Before he died, when he asked for water, Xu Fugen and Chen Chengquan saw it. I don't know what illness he suffered, and he suddenly died, etc. Chief Zhan considered that since there had been an affair, Chen's sudden death was highly suspicious. He detained Chen Zhangying for questioning. Zhangying denied bringing three young men to her house, but she knew Zhang Quanfa. The chief sent officers to arrest Quanfa, but he had already disappeared. Xu Fugen and Chen Chengquan were also summoned, and they also testified that they did not know how Chen died. The case became increasingly confusing and bizarre. The chief sent more officers to investigate and learned that a man named Zhang Rensheng had an affair with Chen Ding. He went to arrest him, but he had already fled. The chief ordered all the witnesses in the case to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. The body of the deceased was reported to the court by the local guarantor for examination.</p>

<p>Ten-Yuan Note Suddenly Becomes a One-Yuan Note</p>
<p>A Schoolchild is Deceived, a Small Shopkeeper is Despicable</p>
<p>Xia Zhen, a doctor from Hubei, 26 years old, lives at No. 2 Changyuli, Lafayette Road, at the intersection of Latour Road in the French Concession. His son, Xia Anmei, 9 years old, attends Bide Primary School on Lafayette Road. On the morning of the 6th of this month, at 8 a.m., Xia Anmei took a ten-yuan note from the Central Bank from his father's pocket and took it to Tang Renzhi's (36 years old, from Jiaxing) candy, toy and general store, located at No. 1212 Lafayette Road, in front of the Bide Primary School gate, to buy candy and toy paper pistols, etc., priced at 12 cents. Tang, seeing that Anmei was young and could be bullied, took the ten-yuan note and exchanged it for a red one-yuan note, saying that he had no change to give. He said he was going to the cigarette paper store to exchange it. The child, unsuspecting, took the one-yuan note to the cigarette paper store to exchange it for small silver copper coins, and then paid them to Tang, who gave the child thirty copper coins in change. Xia, being young and ignorant, took the candy and toys he had bought and went home. Later, his father, Xia Zhen, discovered that a banknote was missing from his pocket and asked Anmei, who told him what had happened. Xia then confronted Tang, who denied it evasively. Xia then reported it to the French Public Conveyance. The Public Conveyance sent detective Yang Weisong to arrest Tang Renzhi, and recovered the original stolen banknote, verifying the facts. Yesterday, the Public Conveyance escorted Tang to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Wang Wangxu presided over the trial. Public Conveyance lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, charging him with fraud under Article 365 of the Criminal Law. The witness, the child Xia Anmei, testified in court, saying that he paid him a green ten-dollar note, and he gave me a red one-dollar note, etc. When questioned, Tang claimed that Xia had come to buy things, that he was doing business with another child, and that he did not notice the ten-dollar note. He denied the fraud. The court verified the testimony and ordered a postponement to the 11th for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Two Ships Collide in the Huangpu River One Boatman Dead, One Injured</p>
<p>Chen Guichun Breaks Ribs and Dies Wang A'si and Others are Turned Over to the General Bureau for Legal Action</p>
<p>Chen A'chun, 51, from Linghu, worked as a broom vendor, hiring his fellow villagers Chen Guichun and Wu Guirong. Recently, they loaded a boatload of brooms from the Zhejiang mountains to Shanghai, mooring at the No. 67 pontoon at the South Pier in Nanshi. At around 9 p.m. the night before, the boat was unloading brooms to the Xun'an Wheel when it was suddenly struck by a charcoal boat loaded by Wang A'si from Dongtai, which was traveling south to north with the tide and intended to dock at the pier. The collision broke the bamboo tops on both sides and touched Chen and Wu. Chen Guichun suffered severe injuries to his upper body and lost consciousness in an instant. Wu Guirong was less seriously injured. The shipowner quickly sent the two injured men by vehicle to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. According to the hospital doctors, Chen Guichun's ribs were broken, so he died yesterday morning. Wu Guirong is safe. The news was learned by Zhu Haisan, the captain of the Marine Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who, considering it to be a matter of life and death, sent police officer Fu Cheng to investigate. Wang A'si, the owner of the charcoal boat, and Wang's partners, Fan Xiaohu and the plaintiff Chen A'chun, were all taken to the team and escorted to the General Bureau for interrogation yesterday morning. The local Baojia was instructed to report to the court for a post-mortem examination.</p>
<p>Male Corpse Hanged on a Grave Hill</p>
<p>The night before last, in an open space on the Tan Family Cemetery Hill in Nanshi, a man of about forty years old, wearing a black cloth jacket, blue cloth pants, bald and barefoot, resembling a rickshaw puller, hanged himself from a tree next to the cemetery. The body was discovered by a passerby at 7 a.m., who reported it to the nearby police post, which in turn reported it to the Ximen Branch. The Baojia in charge was instructed to report to the local court for a post-mortem examination. The court sent a prosecutor to conduct the examination at around 3 p.m. yesterday and ordered the Baojia to prepare a coffin and shroud for the body from the charitable hall.</p>

<p>Shen Bao, Third Sheet</p>
<p>Construction Factory Owner Gong Shaoting Strangles His Paramour and Mutilates the Body to Destroy the Evidence</p>
<p>After the Murder, He Falsely Reported to the Police that the Paramour Had Run Away with Valuables</p>
<p>More Than a Year Later, the Truth is Discovered and the Cousin Avenge His Aunt</p>
<p>丨Gong Shaoting's Love for the New and Loathing of the Old Leads to This Cruel and Ruthless Act丨</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a shocking accusation in writing. The accuser was Xie Baolin, 36 years old, from Changshu, residing at No. 5 Dingningli, behind the Enpaiya Cinema on Maigaobao Road, French Concession. His accusation stated that his aunt, Gu Aqiaojie, was strangled to death by her lover</p>
<h3>Gong Shaoting from Pudong</h3>
<p>and Gong's new paramour, a woman named Hou, and Gong's workers, Li Baosheng and Zhou Baoquan, in the third month of the lunar calendar last year. After her death, she was buried for several months, then her body was exhumed, dismembered into several pieces, and buried deep to destroy the evidence. He requested that justice be served. Captain Lu was shocked by the accusation. At first, he suspected other motives, but because it involved a life, he secretly sent officer Zhou Peisan to investigate. Zhou followed orders and conducted a covert investigation. Within a few days,</p>
<h3>The Truth is Revealed</h3>
<p>Gong is from Gaoqiao, Pudong. Although he is sixty years old, he is still lustful. His first wife died many years ago. When Gong reached the age of forty, he became acquainted with Gu Aqiaojie, a woman from Changshu. At this time, Gong was still an ordinary carpenter, while Aqiaojie was a "mama" working in a Westerner's house and had accumulated a considerable amount of savings. After Gong became involved with her, he used Gu's savings to start a construction business, which became very successful. The Gong Hongtai Construction Factory at No. 927 Gongxingqiao South, Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei District, is owned and operated by Gong. The paramour</p>
<h3>Aqiao Lived in the Factory</h3>
<p>In recent years, the business has become even more prosperous, and he has become a wealthy man. Unexpectedly, Gong, satiated with wealth, became lecherous. Disliking Aqiaojie's fading beauty, he secretly developed a relationship with a local woman named Hou in the spring of last year, and built a golden house for her at No. 37 Dashunli, Keming Road, as a permanent place to hide his mistress. However, the affair was not kept secret, and soon Aqiaojie found out. Jealousy flared, and</p>
<h3>She Often Quarrelled with Gong</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Gong, infatuated with his new love, Hou, conceived a wicked plan. In the sixth month of the lunar calendar the year before last, Gong secretly discussed the matter with his wife's son-in-law, Shen Fufu. On the morning of the 21st day of the third month of the lunar calendar last year, Gong led Hou, Shen Fufu, and four trusted workers, carrying hemp ropes, into Aqiaojie's bedroom. After strangling her to death, they transported the body outside and dug a pit about four feet deep.</p>
<h3>Hastily Burying the Corpse</h3>
<p>Afterwards, he paid Shen Fufu sixty yuan as compensation, ordering him to flee to another port to avoid trouble. Gong, going all the way, fabricated a report to the local police station the following morning, claiming that Ah Qiao had absconded with belongings, requesting an investigation. Apart from the murderers present at the scene, there was practically no flaw in his plan. Even nearby neighbors deeply believed Ah Qiao had fled. Unexpectedly, two months later, in early May of that year, Gong suddenly worried that the burial was not deep enough, and the body was under the factory, fearing that once summer arrived,</p>
<h3>The Corpse Odor Would Inevitably Leak Out</h3>
<p>He then bribed three local workers in the factory, Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, and A Gui, planning to dig up the body again. However, due to the many eyes and ears in the factory, the plan failed. A year later, in mid-May of this year, Gong was still uneasy. He colluded with Zhou and the others again to excavate, finding that the body had already decomposed. They then used a sharp axe to</p>
<h3>Chop Off Ah Qiao’s Head</h3>
<p>And cut the body in half at the waist. A can of foul-smelling liquid was poured over the corpse, followed by lime. They then dug a deep pit, about six feet, near the third back door of the newly built bungalow in the factory, burying the two sections of the body. The soil was then covered with cement. At the same time, Zhou Baoquan used a bamboo basket to transport the severed head to the wasteland of the Zhu family residence on North Shixing Road and buried it, covering it with a tin bowl as a marker. After the fact,</p>
<h3>Gong Heavily Rewarded Zhou and the Others</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, recently, the deceased's cousin, Xie Baolin, reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation, as his aunt had been missing for over a year and her fate was unknown. Squad Leader Zhou Peisan, after clarifying the above situation, immediately reported to Chief Lu. He dispatched Squad Leader Chen Guangyan, along with detective Tian Ronggen, to Zhu's residence No. 2 in the early hours of the morning. After detaining Li Baosheng (also known as Xia Baosheng, 31 years old), they went to Gong Hongtai's construction factory and arrested Zhou Baoquan, who had moved the body. Then, they went to No. 37 Shunda Lane, Keming Road, where Gong and his mistress, Ms. Hou, were still</p>
<h3>Sleeping Intimately and Not Yet Awake</h3>
<p>They rushed into the bedroom, capturing them all and taking them back to the team. When Chief Lu proposed an interrogation, the plaintiff, Xie Baolin, immediately complained about the previous events and requested justice. The defendants, Gong Shaoting, Gong's Mistress Hou (40 years old), Zhou Baoquan (48 years old), Li Baosheng (31 years old, also known as Xia Baosheng), and the other four, all confessed to the plot to murder Ah Qiao and destroy the evidence. At the same time, they also implicated the accomplice Shen Fufu, 31 years old, who is currently working as a laborer in the construction factory opened by Wang Xiliu, a native of Chuansha, at No. 5 Mutou Lane, North Bridge, Suzhou. As the matter concerned a murder case, it was ordered that a formal document be prepared yesterday morning and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Meanwhile, personnel were dispatched to Gong Hongtai's construction factory to exhume Ah Qiao's body for identification. An order has been issued to subordinates to strictly investigate and apprehend the fugitives, Shen Fufu and Liu Guisheng, and bring them to justice. A rickshaw puller died after mistakenly taking an overdose of medicine.</p>
<p>He thought his leg pain was from running and overdosed on medicine, which proved fatal.</p>
<p>Yuan Zongren, a 24-year-old from Haimen, was working as a rickshaw puller at Dai Yulin's house at No. 4, Lane 121, Minhang Road. Yuan suddenly suffered from severe leg pain recently, and although he sought medical treatment, it was ineffective. He thought he had injured himself from running, so he bought a package of trauma medicine from a pharmacy a few days ago. He ate more than half of it, and the overdose caused poisoning. After his employer discovered this, he was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with medical examiners Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the center to examine the body. Chief Zhu Mengwei of the Chinese police first reported the previous events. Then, Dai Yulin claimed that he worked at Huacheng Tobacco Company and that the deceased was the rickshaw puller he hired. He only knew that the deceased had leg pain but was unaware of his purchase and consumption of trauma medicine. Xue Fuzhi, a tailor, claimed that he was temporarily residing at Dai's house and had seen the deceased swallow two spoonfuls of trauma medicine at the time. He advised him not to take so much, but he refused. After hearing the statements, Guo ordered an examination and determined that the deceased, Yuan Zongren, was a male and died of poisoning before death. The body was handed over to his cousin, Ni Wanshun, for burial. A small package of trauma medicine was handed over to the court's exhibit storage.</p>
<p>A gambling den was raided in Mayuan Lane</p>
<p>Twenty-one gamblers were arrested, and countless gambling tools were seized.</p>
<p>The harm of gambling is no less than that of floods and fierce beasts. Since the authorities have strictly prohibited it, some people still secretly set up gambling dens, called "Osmanthus Gambling Dens," to swindle gamblers' money, causing their credibility to plummet. Recently, Iron Arms Jia, a gambling king, and his gang, Tiedun Wanchang (also known as Zhou Wanchang), seeing the daily decline in gambling revenue, colluded with other accomplices to reorganize and jointly establish a large gambling house named "Changfu Company." They advertised the gambling den to various branch dens and boats to attract gamblers. They initially opened the den in the area where the Chinese and foreign concessions of Zhabei intersect. However, due to the authorities' strict crackdown, they had to change locations three times a day, called "Picking Up Scraps." People in the know began to recognize their hideout. Since the rumors were still tight, they moved to Ma Guiying's house at No. 8 Mayuan Lane in the city yesterday. While they were opening the gambling den at 4 PM, a group of gamblers who were placing bets followed them. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by Director Liu of the Yimiao Police Station, who immediately dispatched Inspector Shi Lantian to lead the patrol police to capture them. When they arrived, it was still early, and the gambling den had not yet opened. They arrested the den owner, Zhou Wanchang, Bai Sanba, Ma Guiying, Shi Jigen, Yang Ayin, Lin Maoda, Sun Changsheng, Wu Jinlin, Shen Afu, Wang Asi, Shen Peigen, Wang Mingzhu, Wu Quan, Liu Depei, Lu Juncai, Wang Zhixi, Tang Agou, Peng Changgen, Tang Quan, Wang Agen, and Liu Deyi, totaling twenty-one people. They also seized "Changfu Company," "Void if Unsealed," "Void if Scratched," three wooden stamps, Changfu Company advertisements and receipts, a bundle of gambling den leaflets, four stamps, one gambling den, one sealed bag, one incense burner, two doors and windows, as well as one opium pipe, one lamp, eighteen opium pellets, one mahjong set, and scattered items such as silver dollars, cash, coins, and copper coins. They were all taken to the police station for investigation. After questioning, Director Liu learned that the defendants all denied being the owners of the large gambling den. After questioning the homeowner, Ma Guiying, he stated that his friend, Zhou Wanchang, rented the house from him and only said that it was a club for friends to rest and relax. The case concerns a large gambling den, which is extremely illegal, and it is ordered that evidence be gathered, the suspects be sent to the bureau, and the case be handled strictly.</p>
<p>The Hankou Road One-Way Traffic Restriction Modified, Rickshaws Can Travel All Day</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Responds to the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>Hankou Road businesses appealed for the cancellation of the one-way traffic restriction to maintain the market. The Public Works Department has decided to modify the regulations. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the businesses on the road yesterday, stating, "Regarding the one-way traffic issue on Hankou Road, we have received a response from the Public Concession Public Works Department stating that the impact of the one-way traffic on Hankou Road on the business of the shops along the road has been carefully considered by our association. It has now been decided to modify the regulations and implement a trial method: rickshaws will be allowed to travel east and west on the entire length of Hankou Road throughout the day. This letter is to inform you of this decision. Please take note of this and inform the shops along the road accordingly." This letter is to inform you of this decision. Please take note and inform the shops along the road accordingly. This is addressed to the Fuchang Gift Shop.</p>
<p>A Murdered Female Corpse Discovered in Yinxiang Port</p>
<p>Yesterday, a murdered female corpse was found on the side of the road in Yinjiawan, behind the Yinxiang Port Racecourse. She was about 30 years old, wearing a cyan padded jacket and black silk pants, with a white undershirt and pants, light red socks, and a pair of felt shoes with tan trim. Her short hair was disheveled, and she looked like a female worker in a factory. A passerby spotted her and reported it to the local police station, who ordered the local warden, Nie Guifa, to report it to the local court for examination. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhang Zi and Examiner Xuan Zhiming arrived at the scene. The examination revealed that the female corpse had a sharp axe wound on her throat, severing both the trachea and esophagus. There was an axe wound on the right corner of her mouth and three axe wounds on the back of her head. The ring finger on her left hand was also chopped off, connected only by a thin layer of skin. It was determined that she died from fatal injuries. The scene was photographed and documented. As no family members came forward to claim the body, it was ordered to be placed in a coffin by the Tongshan Hall and to await the arrest of the murderer for investigation.</p>

<p>Crowds at the Carter Bathhouse</p>
<p>The Carter Bathhouse on Carter Road is well-equipped. Prominent figures from all walks of life in the city often go there for bathing. Recently, in order to repay the patronage of all circles, they have spared no great sacrifice and completely repainted all the bathing rooms. All kinds of supplies have also been re-purchased with the latest and most superior items. Whether it is elegant rooms, basins, or pools, disinfectant is added to the bath water to ensure cleanliness and hygiene, which is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai bathhouses. The prices remain the same, and preferential treatment is given. It is truly the only bathing place in Shanghai. Therefore, recently, there has been an overwhelming crowd going to the bathhouse, and they are almost unable to cope. Those who have tried it have all praised it unanimously.</p>
<p>New Dance Stars at the Paramount</p>
<p>The Paramount Ballroom at the intersection of Yuyuan Road is at the height of its prosperity and holds the leading position in the entertainment industry in Shanghai. On New Year's Eve and New Year's Day in the solar calendar, it was packed to capacity, filled to the brim, and open all day, setting a new record. The grand occasion can be imagined. The entertainment programs in the hall have always been praised by Chinese and Western ladies. Recently, at great expense, they hired male and female dance stars John and Harry from the United States. They have already performed on stage that evening, showcasing their unique and outstanding skills. Their steps are round and steady, and their poses are beautiful, all of which have never been seen before. The act of holding up the jade body with one hand and performing a devilish whirlwind dance, incorporating thrilling elements into one, is even more exquisite and unparalleled. No wonder the entire hall erupted in applause and was amazed by what they saw. Ladies throughout Shanghai who seek a place for entertainment and a place for enjoyment of the senses should choose the Paramount.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words, Hiding Tears, Selling Oneself, Complaining of Hardship, Carefully Seeking Help, Eagerly Seeking Refuge in the East</p>
<p>He sat among the guests with his legs crossed, looking at everyone's faces, and smiled, "The meaning of the word 'difficult' is very broad. It doesn't necessarily mean wanting someone's money, wanting someone's life, or restricting someone's physical freedom to be called 'difficult.' In fact, anything that makes someone feel mentally uncomfortable is also called 'difficult.' For example, Mr. Li just said that the good news has arrived for this lady. You didn't think that the so-called good news is actually bad news for this lady." Although he knew that Yueying probably wouldn't understand the word "bad news," he didn't want to say it too bluntly, so he lowered his voice slightly. Although Li Shilian didn't understand literature very well, he could understand the meaning of these two words, and he was a little surprised, staring at Cheng Zhiqian. Zhiqian smiled, "If I don't explain this sentence, Mr. You might be confused. Let me give you an example. Just now, this Auntie Hu brought this lady to Mr. Jia's house. They not only have hope for the future, but also have a small hope at the moment, which is that the waiter, Xiao Ji, had already promised them when he invited them last night that they would receive one dollar if they came as agreed. This one dollar may seem trivial to us, but it would be enough for their family of five or six to buy food for several days. When they have no other options, this one dollar can temporarily sustain their lives for a few days. So, Xiao Ji directed this lady to apply powder, rouge, and change clothes, and she did as she was told. As a result, they let others see her for free, and it is said that they were even kicked out." Li Shilian smiled and shook his head, "No, Mr. Jia had two foreign friends visiting him. He felt that it was inconvenient for this lady to be there, so he asked her to leave temporarily." (106)</p>
<h3>Random Talks of a Traveler Returning from Hanyang</h3>
<p>— Kangjianzhaifu</p>
<p>丨A New Life Reveals Vitality丨</p>
<p>"In heaven, there are nine-headed birds; on earth, there are old Hubei people." The notoriety of the Hubei people, and especially the prevalence of fleecing in Hankou port, has always made travelers shy away. However, since the New Life Movement has been carried out vigorously, the municipal administration and daily life have been completely renewed, displaying a vigorous atmosphere of national rebirth.</p>
<p>The streets are swept at any time, and even the alleys are free of garbage and filth. Public toilets are built underground, and at appropriate intervals, there is an iron railing indicating the "Door of Convenience."</p>
<p>There are no pedestrians on the road wearing hats askew, unbuttoned, or with cigarettes in their mouths. When walking, everyone walks on the left side, especially when going up and down the docks, they walk separately, in an orderly manner, without any chaotic crowding. Hired vehicles and horses are all priced at fixed rates, and under the supervision of the police, there is absolutely no act of fleecing.</p>
<p>Oddly dressed and permed coquettish women cannot swagger through the streets. In hotels, various moods and special odors that interfere with sleep and tempt people to fall are also cut off. General life is returning to rigor from romance, and is tending to tension from relaxation. The individual's licentious and unrestricted freedom is bound by "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." And the social customs and order have suddenly changed the long-standing old look! The above words are snippets I got from a conversation with a traveler returning from Hankou.</p>
<p>"Things are done by people!" Who says that the long-standing nation cannot take a revival starting point from this easy-to-know and easy-to-implement New Life Movement?</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Tianzai)</p>
<p>The more _________ people are, = the poorer they are in sympathy; the poorer people are, the richer they are in sympathy.</p>
<p>Snowflakes fall down, covering up the filthy world. It's a pity it can't last long.</p>
<p>A ruler can measure the length of things, a clock can calculate time. How can people's hearts be revealed?</p>
<h3>Practicing Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>When I was six or seven years old, as soon as I came back from elementary school, my grandmother would urge me to practice calligraphy.</p>
<p>The paper had already been found for me - a sheet that had been used to wrap things, spread out on the desk. Grandma held the [priceless copybook] with one hand and smoothed the paper with the other, then led me to sit down and copy the book.</p>
<p>Nothing else was a problem, except that my grandmother, who was watching over me, was sitting a little too close. So, whenever the corner of the room fell silent, and only a pale yellow ray of the setting sun moved quietly on the dust-covered wall, her faint breathing would pluck at the strings of my childish heart, often disturbing my temporarily sensitive nerves, causing the brush with its worn-out bristles, which I usually used to scribble freely, to become more and more flustered the more I tried to please, becoming so stiff and disobedient.</p>
<p>Grandma herself couldn't write the word "安" well, so the quality of the characters could be passable. However, she could never stand the unevenness of the lines, with straight lines turning into curves and diagonals.</p>
<p>Frowning, she told me to stop writing; drawing on her own experience, she slowly folded the paper into a grid of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines for me.</p>
<p>[You have to be extra careful! A scholar's child writing like this is like a cowherd scrawling in the fields, how embarrassing!]</p>
<p>Grandma - my kind and gentle grandmother - felt a pang of sadness in her heart when she saw that her child was uncared for and not making progress, and her voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>What good people detest. Until her death, she always cared for me especially.</p>
<h3>Sketch of a Fortune-Telling Stall</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>In a corner of the road, there was a small, rickety square table, and hanging on the front of the table was a piece of white cloth with the large characters: [King Wen's Divine Oracle, unerring, utmost sincerity and Tao...] On the table were scattered word scrolls, a white lacquered board, a worn-out brush, leftover ink, stationery, envelopes, a wooden box, and other items. Sitting in the middle was a fortune-teller with a figure-eight mustache, known as "Xiao Iron Mouth," wearing a pair of large, round, old-fashioned glasses, set against a withered and bloodless face, with wrinkles like streetcar tracks deeply etched on his forehead; but he was full of spirit, raising his worn-out brush, dipping it in the leftover ink, and painting on the white lacquer.</p>
<p>He spoke many江湖formulas, attracting people who often strolled along the road to stop beside him, gazing and listening like wooden puppets.</p>
<p>Xiao Iron Mouth's mysterious formula indeed worked. A young man emerged from the crowd, randomly took a word scroll from the wooden box, and threw it in front of Xiao Iron Mouth.</p>
<p>Xiao Iron Mouth immediately smiled, stopped speaking, and looked the young man up and down. Then, he raised his old glasses, wiped his eyes that could recognize heroes from humble origins, and said, [Brother! What do you want to ask?] The young man said shyly, [My wife is about to give birth, and I don't know if it will be a boy or a girl? So I came to your place to ask for a divination.]</p>
<p>Iron Mouth nodded with a knowing smile, unfolded the word scroll, which had the character [食] written on it.</p>
<p>[Ah!] Iron Mouth said dramatically, [According to the deduction of this character, your wife will have twins! Look! The top of the character 食is 人, and below is 玉, which becomes 金, so the first one will be a daughter. Look again! The bottom of the character 食 is 良, and if you add an ear to the right of 良, it becomes 郎, so the second one will be a son! Haha! Brother, you are very fortunate!] Iron Mouth suddenly stopped talking, his greedy eyes fixed on the young man's face, unmoving.</p>
<p>The young man only gave a bitter smile, seemingly wanting to say something but unable to, and took out about a dozen copper coins from his pocket, threw them on the table, and left.</p>
<h3>Wavering in the Blown-Out Emptiness of Depression</h3>
<p>— Yin Juan</p>
<h3>The Piao Miao Record of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>How could it be that after decades of life in the palace, surrounded by countless tiresome etiquettes and ceremonies, even when she was asleep, she couldn't escape this encirclement, and yet she hadn't grown weary of it by now? One could say that she was playing tricks on herself, binding herself, not allowing herself any freedom of action: from morning to night, she was under the control of those formalities and rituals for not even a single minute. Even today's trip to the hunting grounds was still full of commemorative significance and couldn't be considered a purely recreational outing; the only difference was that today's ceremonies would no longer be performed in the palace but on another stage! Although this stage had a very close relationship with our ancestors, it was truly unfamiliar to us ourselves.</p>
<p>After a long journey, our large group of people arrived in front of the vast hunting grounds. After entering, according to the Empress Dowager's idea, we went directly to a palace. The construction of this palace was obviously very, very old, certainly decades or even centuries earlier than those palaces in Shengjing. Fortunately, people had been assigned to take care of it at ordinary times, so it hadn't collapsed; and before the Empress Dowager arrived in Fengtian, the local officials must have sent people to repair it again, otherwise, it would never have been so neat and clean! This palace was really just a rest room. Whenever a Manchu emperor came here to hunt, he would first enter this palace for a short rest, so that the people waiting on him outside could release the confined beasts, and then notify him to go out and chase them. When he was tired of playing, he would come back to rest again. But each time the delay was very short, and no leader had ever stayed here overnight, so the area of this palace was smaller than ordinary palaces, with only three rooms inside, and the construction was also very simple.

<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3>On the Indian Ocean (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Port Said is divided into two major districts: in the European district, there are many skyscrapers with ivory-colored walls, set off by the verdant shade of palm trees, which is quite pleasing to the eye. The post office, banks, and large hotels are all located in this very international and modern district. Many mixed-race women of mixed blood leisurely stroll in the park or on the sidewalks, pushing baby carriages. For two whole weeks, we hadn't seen a single female figure on the ship, which was like a prison cell. Seeing those wives and daughters raised by the local whites was like finding an oasis in the desert.</p>
<p>The second district is the Arab district, where the streets are filthy, and one must hold one's nose while walking. At the intersections of the streets, there are many coffee shops, where locals wearing white robes and red round hats sit. Some also hold water pipes shaped like Chinese 胡琴, lazily whiling away the time. The streets are full of flocks of sheep like stray dogs, traveling in teams, accompanied by guards. In the vegetable market, one can see many Arab women, all dressed in black, never wearing brightly colored fabrics, their faces covered with black veils, unable to distinguish their beauty or ugliness. They have curly black hair, thick eyebrows, and large, round black eyes, glancing at us, their expressions extremely mysterious.</p>
<p>Most Arabs believe in Islam and must kneel in prayer five times a day. I did not enter the mosque because I had to take off my shoes and pay money. The area was originally under the influence of both Britain and France, but in recent years, Italian business has gradually expanded. Large stores selling Japanese goods are often seen in the city, and there are also many Japanese mail ships passing through.</p>
<p>I returned to the ship at four o'clock in the afternoon. I bought several local and Suez Canal scenery photos and developed the photos I took in London, which was not expensive. The fruits in Port Said are very cheap. Large, golden oranges can be bought for twenty for one shilling. With our old guide accompanying us, we got a lot of bargains everywhere. The old guide accompanied us for seven hours, and we each rewarded him with one shilling. He expressed great satisfaction and thanked us repeatedly before leaving.</p>
<p>The next day we arrived at Sabong, a naval port on the island of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, southwest of Singapore. According to the sailors, the place is a small village with only one lively street. The residents are Malays, and there are also many overseas Chinese from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The main local products are fruits and spices. Occasionally, there are sales of sable, parrots, and young tigers. It is a pity that my luggage is tight, otherwise, buying strange birds and beasts and sending them to relatives and friends in Shanghai could also be used as New Year's gifts.</p>

<h3>Education News</h3>
<p>The Central Government Plans to Allocate 1.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>To Establish Scientific Museums in Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar, and Suiyuan</p>
<p>▲Half of the funds will be used to expand teacher training and elementary education in each province.</p>
<p>▲Nanjing, July 7th dispatch: The proposal by Central Committee member Yu Youren to allocate 1.5 million yuan to establish national scientific museums in the Northwest and Southwest, to be first tried out by the Ministry of Education, has been reviewed by the Ministry of Education. The response states that the Northwest and Southwest are remote provinces and regions with vast territories, tight education budgets, cultural stagnation, and that vocational schools, normal schools, and secondary school content are mostly lacking in substance and incomplete in equipment, and should be subsidized to facilitate improvement. It is now proposed to use half of the funds to establish scientific museums in remote and poor provinces and to expand scientific equipment in secondary and higher schools. The remaining half will be used to expand teacher training and elementary education in each province. The provinces and regions to be subsidized will temporarily be limited to Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar, and Suiyuan. As for the amount of subsidy for each province and the detailed regulations for its use, it is proposed to request the Central Committee to approve the principle of the above-mentioned funding, and then instruct the Ministry of Education to prepare and submit a detailed plan for review. After deliberation by the Political Council, it was decided that it was generally feasible and instructed the Ministry of Education to formulate detailed measures for review. The State Council has now issued an order to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Education to comply.</p>
<p>Report on Inspection of Vocational Education in Beijing</p>
<p>▲Zhong Daozan Lists Five Points to the Ministry for Improvement</p>
<p>▲Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th dispatch: The Ministry of Education also dispatched Zhong Daozan to inspect the state of vocational education in Beijing. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry. The report lists the main points that need to be improved, including: (1) Most private vocational schools have simple equipment and ineffective teaching methods, and should be strictly assessed. Those that are poorly managed should be ordered to close down. (2) The content of municipal senior industrial vocational schools should be enriched, and senior vocational schools should pay attention to practice. (3) The private Zhonghua Opera School should focus on the improvement of drama. (4) The annual income and expenditure of the five schools of the private Fanshan Charity Institution are barely balanced and should be reorganized. (5) The central government’s funds to the city have been distributed according to the new quota and should be quickly realized, as originally planned to expand vocational education.</p>

<p>Situation of the First Joint Entrance Examination for Secondary Schools in Shanghai</p>
<p>▲The Chairman Personally Inspects</p>
<p>▲Good Order in Each Examination Hall</p>
<p>The joint entrance examination for the first semester of the 23rd academic year of secondary school students in this city began yesterday and was held in four examination halls: Shangwen, Wanzhu, Jingye, and Wuben. Chairman Pan personally visited each examination hall yesterday, and the order was good. Staff members of the office, such as Zhang Yongchun, were stationed at Lake Society and worked late into the night, which was quite tense.</p>
<h3>Strict Supervision and Good Order</h3>
<p>More than 900 candidates participated in the joint examination this time, which was held in four examination halls. Each examination hall had one chief examiner and four invigilators. Candidates from each school were accompanied by staff from the original school to the examination hall on time. Admission tickets were checked when entering the hall. Candidate seats were pre-arranged by the Education Bureau. Director Pan personally visited each examination hall yesterday and gave instructions on everything. The situation in the examination halls was quite good. Each examination paper was sealed and opened on the spot by the chief examiner, distributed according to the number. After the examination was completed, the papers were collected and sealed by the chief examiner, affixed with a private seal, and taken back to the Education Bureau and submitted to the Joint Examination Committee for separate evaluation and grading. Then, the committee opened the sealed paper and checked the name, which was quite strict. Today's examination subjects for high school are mathematics in the morning, geography and chemistry in the afternoon, and mathematics in the morning and physics and chemistry in the afternoon for junior high school.</p>
<h3>Measures for Students Who Fail</h3>
<p>Students who fail in all subjects in the joint entrance examination will not be allowed to graduate. Those who fail in three or more subjects should be required to repeat a grade, but repeating a grade is limited to two times. Those who cannot repeat a grade for some reason may be given a certificate of completion from the original school, stating the grades of each subject in the joint entrance examination, with a note indicating that they failed the joint entrance examination. Those who fail in two or one subject in high school may participate in the next joint examination in each subject, limited to two times. If they wish to continue their studies, they may apply for a certificate of admission to higher education from the competent educational administrative agency, stating the grades of each subject in the joint entrance examination, and they may be allowed to take the entrance examination for higher education first. After being admitted, they will be allowed to be probationary students. They will not be considered formal students until they have passed the next joint examination in each subject and have obtained a graduation certificate. Those who fail in two or one subject in junior high school may participate in the next joint examination in each subject, limited to three times, and may graduate after passing. If they wish to continue their studies, they may take the high school entrance examination with the same qualifications.</p>
<h3>Method for Calculating Grades in Each Subject</h3>
<p>The method for calculating the grades in each subject of the joint entrance examination is to calculate 40% of the graduation results of each subject in the school and 60% of the results of each subject in the joint examination. The above results are all calculated by percentage, and decimals are rounded up or down. From 80 to 100 points is Grade A, 70 to 79 points is Grade B, 60 to 69 points is Grade C, and less than 60 points is Grade D. Grades A, B, and C are passing grades, and Grade D is a failing grade. At the end of the joint examination, the Education Bureau will rank the average of the joint entrance examination grades of each student, the proportion of the number of graduating students in each school to the number of participants in the joint examination, and the proportion of the number of participants in the joint examination to the number of passing students into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Then, the average of the grades of the students who passed the joint examination in each school will be divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Regulations on Rewards and Punishments</h3>
<p>(1) Student Section: Students who participate in the graduation examination, achieve Grade A in all subjects of the examination and rank in the top three overall, or achieve Grade B or above in all subjects of the examination and are ranked in Grade A overall, the former will be awarded scholarships and certificates, the latter will be awarded certificates.

<p>Central Film Inspection Committee Jointly Searched for Supernatural Films with the Education and Public Security Bureaus Yesterday</p>
<p>The central government had long prohibited the production and screening of supernatural films. Since the establishment of the Central Film Inspection Committee, it has paid particular attention to and strictly enforced this ban. Shanghai is an area where domestic film production companies are concentrated, and it is also a breeding ground for the production of supernatural films. Although the central government's crackdown is strict, many small film companies still invest and take chances, secretly producing forbidden films of a supernatural, absurd, obscene, and theft-inducing nature, and privately transporting them to inland and remote areas of Nanyang for screening, only seeking to make huge profits, and disregarding the central government's laws and social education. Recently, the central government specially dispatched commissioners to Shanghai to handle the matter and investigate such forbidden supernatural films, in order to prevent private production and screening from poisoning society. According to investigations conducted by the Film Inspection Committee prior to the operation, they had identified companies that specialized in producing supernatural films. On the 6th and 7th, they jointly dispatched police officers from the Municipal Education Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to search each company at its registered address. It was reported that they seized seven film companies, including Great Era, Arhat, and Huadian, and confiscated many supernatural films. The confiscated forbidden films have been sealed up, and the companies have been temporarily closed, pending further action. It is reported that these forbidden films will be sent to Nanjing by the Film Inspection Committee for processing within the next few days.</p>

<h3>Special Article</h3>
<p>A Review of the Rejuvenation Week at Shanghai North Middle School (Continued) Tang Naikang</p>
<p>(2) Methods A. Conduct individual talks and group lectures. Individual talks are conducted separately by the director of student affairs, student affairs officers, and other relevant teachers. Group education is carried out during memorial weeks, various commemorative meetings, or temporary gatherings. B. Guest Lectures. Invite well-known people from outside the school to give lectures on the essentials of self-cultivation or international issues to awaken students' attention to international political trends and improve their learning efficiency. C. Implement the New Life Movement. Since the promotion of the New Life Movement in this city, the school has taken this as one of the guiding principles of moral education and has made unremitting efforts to promote it. Successively held general meetings of all teachers, staff, and students to clarify the true meaning of the new life. D. Visit student families and issue questionnaires to connect with families. The purpose of education is to enable students to achieve balanced development in intelligence, personality, and physical fitness to cultivate healthy citizens. However, the student's personality is best known to the family members. Therefore, the school regards visiting families as a kind of moral education method and issues questionnaires to clarify the family environment of the students and provide appropriate guidance.</p>
<p>(C) Physical Education The school advocates universal training in physical education and strives to avoid distorted development. This year, a physical education director was specially appointed to take charge. The daily training is divided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Morning Exercises Morning exercises are held twice. The first time is from 6:30 to 7:00 AM for boarding students. The second time is from 7:30 to 8:00 AM for day students. The general affairs, academic affairs, and student affairs offices assign staff to take attendance. Those who intentionally do not attend will be considered truant.</p>
<p>(2) Regular Classes Follow the standards set by the ministry, allocate teaching materials, and train students of all levels.</p>
<p>(3) Extracurricular Training Prescribe mandatory extracurricular items and minimum standards.</p>
<p>Divided into track and field events, ball games, etc., divided into teams and groups, practice once every morning and evening. Before the end of the semester, hold championship competitions to test the results.</p>
<p>(4) Physical Examination Conduct twice each semester, held separately at the beginning and end of the semester.</p>
<p>(5) Boy Scout Training All junior high school students receive Boy Scout training. Indoor teaching and field practice are equally important.</p>
<p>(D) Student Life People cannot live independently apart from the group. The importance of group life is advocated by scholars at home and abroad. The school believes that after the young students leave the school, they will all be members of society. Group life is essential for training. Therefore, within a reasonable scope, we provide guidance to enable it to develop. A brief description is as follows: (1) Grade Associations Each grade has a grade association, which is organized by the elected officials of each grade, in order to promote the progress of fellow classmates and the harmony of feelings. (2) Harmonica Society Music is a powerful tool for cultivating temperament, and the harmonica is easy to learn. Therefore, there is an organization of the Harmonica Society. (3) Xiaoshe. Xiaoshe is organized by students who love literature and social sciences. Members write articles on their reading experiences every week and publish them once as a forum for expressing their thoughts. (4) Hiking Team. Students of all grades freely organize and often travel together on Sundays and holidays. Their footprints have spread to Wusong, Gaoqiao, and other places with elegant scenery. (5) Sports Organizations Sports organizations have shown a vigorous atmosphere in the school. At present, there are fitness teams, black cat teams, track and field teams, football teams, volleyball teams, basketball teams, etc. Inter-grade competitions are held once each semester.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>The above are all general conditions of the past year. Looking at the past is to plan for the future. The Republic of China in 1935 will soon appear before our eyes. The various facilities of the school will also develop accordingly. The first step of rejuvenation has come to an end. What we are managing from now on is the second step of development, such as improving moral education, enriching equipment, and expanding student enrollment. We will do our best to realize it in order to live up to the good intentions of people from all walks of life. Those who are wise in the world are fortunate to correct them. (End)</p>

<p>Tonight: Xiqing Basketball Team to Play Jiangwan in Jiangwan</p>
<p>Game Starts at 7:15 PM</p>
<p>The Xiqing Basketball Game will start at 7:15 tonight. Xiqing's game against Jiangwan is sure to be competitive, and excitement can be expected. Generally, the Pirates are likely to win and complete their reign in this competition. In yesterday's two Group A games, although Tongji suffered a crushing defeat of 24 to 60 against McLing, they performed well in the first half, with the situation extremely tense and the score fluctuating rapidly. Eventually, due to insufficient stamina, they could not persevere to the end, resulting in the defeat. Jinan's victory over John was effortless, with the final score being 64 to 33.</p>
<p>▲ Jinan Defeats John</p>
<p>Within the first minute of the game, John fought hard, creating a tense situation and taking the lead with 6 to 4 and then 10 to 9. Jinan stepped up their efforts, and Yin and Xu, the two forwards, repeatedly scored, causing the score to rise rapidly. John then fell behind. In the second half, John's defense was weak, and Jinan intensified their efforts, with outstanding peaks, increasing the score continuously. The result was a resounding victory with 64 to 33.</p>

<p>▲ McLing Defeats Tongji</p>
<p>In the first half of Tongji's match against McLing, they surprisingly played well. McLing initially fielded a second-rate lineup, but seeing the unfavorable situation, they quickly brought in players like Locke. The situation remained very even, with both sides' offense and defense being extremely tight. Tongji's athletes performed excellently, which had not been seen before, leaving McLing's generals at a loss. Tongji once led 14 to 11, and then the score became tied at 16 to 16. Later, Locke made two free throws, and Berry successively scored two goals, giving McLing a lead of 22 to 16 in the first half. In the second half, the situation changed drastically. Tongji, due to insufficient stamina, was unable to defend, allowing McLing to trample them at will. The game ended with a score of 60 to 24.</p>

<p>Rumors About Pan Lai Are Said to Be Due to Misunderstanding</p>
<p>▲ O'Brien's Representative Has Acknowledged It</p>
<p>▲ Hollywood, 5th (Reuters) The mystery surrounding whether Pan Lai, the world's number one tennis player, will join the professional tennis players' group has been broken today. After O'Brien announced that Pan Lai would come to San Francisco on February 23 to sign a contract, Pan Lai immediately denied it in Australia. However, O'Brien insisted that it was true. But today, a Reuters reporter visited O'Brien or his representative, who agreed to become a professional player. O'Brien's initial claim was entirely due to a misunderstanding, it is said.</p>
<p>Sports Referees Association Holds Monthly Meeting</p>

<p>Results of Three Chinese Football Matches</p>
<p>In addition to the scheduled matches that were postponed due to wet fields, the Chinese Football Association held two matches last week: Lingnan vs. Railway and Gonghua vs. Jiangnan. However, due to inadequate facilities on the field, the referee found it difficult to conduct the Gonghua vs. Jiangnan match. Jiangnan won 1-0 without effort. Host teams in future matches are expected to be fully prepared in advance to avoid disappointing both teams and to maintain the spirit of the football association. Another postponed match was won by Shangfang. The results of the three matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Railway Defeats Lingnan　　Hua Character Group　　4 to 2</p>
<p>Jiangnan Defeats Gonghua　　Zu Character Group　　1 to 0</p>
<p>Shangfang Defeats Beicheng　　Qiu Character Group　　1 to 0 Beicheng Forfeits</p>

<p>Yesterday's Football Match Held</p>
<p>▲ Tianyun Lou Defeats Gongwutai Two to One</p>
<p>▲ Da Wutai Wins Against Tianchan Wutai Four to One</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, actors from various theaters held a friendly football match at the Public Sports Field. From 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, Tianyun Lou played against Gongwutai, and from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, Da Wutai played against Tianchan Wutai. Only four to five hundred colleagues from the same industry came to watch. At the ninth bell, Hu Bie blew the whistle, and the war began. Tianyun Lou and Gongwutai drew their swords and glared at each other, fiercely fighting. Gongwutai had an unfavorable kickoff, and Ma Qingyun intercepted the ball and rushed forward. Tianyun Lou's forward chased, and Long Yuheng seized the opportunity to pass in front of the goal. Ma Jiliang side-volleyed, and the ball went into the net, opening the score. At this moment, Gongwutai seemed to have a chance to revive, and the audience worried for Tianyun's army. However, Tianyun's army was not weak and continued to attack tirelessly. Zhang Shunting welcomed the shot, which was caught and thrown out by Chang Jie. Ma Jiliang swerved slightly and then shot fiercely. Xie Xiaotian was suddenly hit by a stray bullet, his hand touching the ball, and a penalty kick was awarded. Zhao Shunyi took the penalty kick and shot the ball into the net cleanly and beautifully. Amidst the gazes of thousands and the cheers of hundreds, Gongwutai's morale was greatly boosted, and their iron cavalry galloped horizontally and vertically. Xiao Gu started an uprising on the border, attacking the low line and passing back to the center. Ma Qingyun was extremely cunning, bowing as if to yield, letting the ball pass. Wang Huchen took advantage of the opportunity and shot fiercely into the goal, making the score 2 to 1. At 10:30 AM, the silver horn sounded, and another match began. Da Wutai and Tianchan Wutai fought on the battlefield. Only Da Wutai's main general, Yuan Xiaolou, was seen charging left and right, causing chaos and destruction. General Yuan scored two consecutive goals, his face resembling the Liangshan hero [Smiling Tiger]. In the second half, everyone fought hard, gasping for breath. As a result, Yao Shaoqing and Chen Hefeng made multiple hits, and amidst the chaotic battle, everyone forgot their own network lines. As you and I collided, the ball drilled straight into the corner of the goal, resulting in a 4 to 1 victory. Da Wutai happily sang a song of triumph.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Social Nature and Freedom of Art</h3>
<p>— Canyue</p>
<p>Advocates of artistic freedom often conflate the freedom of art in its creative construction with the freedom of art within social conditions, attempting to eliminate the social nature of art. However, artworks are products of society, not things that fall from the sky. This is undeniable. The so-called limits of artistic freedom can only exist within the scope of its own development within various social conditions. Whether a writer creates consciously or unconsciously, artworks cannot exist apart from the formation or limitations of these many social conditions. Artists can only exercise their creative freedom within this scope. Even if a creator has a vast and boundless realm in their mind's eye, they still cannot transcend this reality. All ideals and fantasies are determined by real conditions.</p>
<p>If it is said that art has a special independence, then this independence refers to the expressive techniques of the writer in the process of creation (the process of artistic construction). This is the independence of the external artistic conditions that the artist bestows upon the artwork, not the trans-social independence of the artwork. The freedom in the artistic creation process is not only valued by those who cling to art, but also valued by all writers. Naturally, when creating, one does not need to consider various restrictions and can act arbitrarily. An artist only needs to expand his creative world during creation and can ignore many constraints (naturally, one must first have accurate observation). For example, when a person writes an essay, he does not need to consider various grammatical conventions, but every article can always be analyzed using grammatical conventions, unless it is a kind of delirium.</p>
<p>This freedom of [think as much as you can imagine, write as much as you can write] is the freedom of the creator during their artistic creation. However, those who advocate the theory of pure artistic freedom believe that because an artist has the free will to create a work, the evaluation of this work should be based on the level of the artist's cultivation and the degree of [artistic quality] given to the work. This view is neglecting the fundamental. It is not known that although the artist's emotions and the application of techniques in the work have unlimited freedom, the artist and his work cannot but be deposited in society. The first condition that should be limited is determined by society. In the structural content and the imagination of the story of [Robinson Crusoe], the writer had extremely free expression, which was successful in terms of art. However, what determined this artistic success and enabled the author to construct such an adventurous and absurd content was the social thought of commercial capital expanding outward at that time, needing to find colonies. Having these social conditions enabled the production of [Robinson Crusoe] and enabled the author to use his artistic freedom to expand and arrange his imaginary story. The Monkey King thought he was very free to take a piss inside the Five Finger Mountain, but he didn't escape the palm of the Buddha. Because he [didn't know] and [couldn't see] the entire palm of the Buddha, he thought he had complete freedom inside the Five Finger Mountain.</p>
<p>During creation, the creator needs to understand this principle in order to gain a broader realm of freedom. He must apply his vision and thought to things that he has grasped with correct understanding and knowledge, so that he can fully use his freedom in the process of constructing the work. Of course, not being free is not good, but freedom that is blind will lead to waste and indulgence. An artist who cannot understand social trends cannot see broad social themes. As a result, he is only selling small and ingenious [genius] in a cage (intellectual and technical). On the contrary, a writer who has a clear understanding of the times and society will see a farther and greater vision. His range of things is wide and real. Therefore, the freedom of art is: the author can have the freedom of use in the process of creation, but the conditions that form the artwork are unfreely restricted by society. Therefore, the evaluation of artworks must be based on a social perspective. Apart from its social value, the [skills] of an artwork will have nothing to rely on.</p>
<h3>The Last Sadness (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mo Qing</p>
<p>Ah, terrible sadness, tonight you have drilled into my heart again! Although I have tried every means to avoid you, is enduring you the only way? Ah, why can't I become harder? Am I destined to be your prisoner for life?</p>
<p>Alas, distant person, I say, it is really useless for you to continue to follow me in my dreams. Although I once sent you into the deep, cold door with my own hands. However, wasn't that your own willingness, and wasn't it very comfortable? Why can't you forgive me!</p>
<p>Alas, poor person! I say, we can really part ways. Now, we are so far apart. You, you should go on your flat, wide road. As for me, let me walk my self-made dangerous single-plank bridge. Now, my life has deteriorated to the point of no return, why do you keep disturbing me so often?</p>
<p>Ah, now I live in this coffin filled with dead people. Is there anything to share? Since you have betrayed your own oath of failure, of course there is nothing to regret, and even if my life is worse than it is now, I have no resentment towards you. I only ask that you can forget it peacefully, and I will be cheerful and bright.</p>
<p>Here, during the day there are two meals of coarse food that I can't swallow, and at night, several of us roll together like dogs in this coffin-shaped, narrow dwelling place with a hole in the ceiling that is almost in an eight-shape. The roof is connected, and the surroundings are fixed with short wooden boards. Is it airtight? Cold wind drills in from the cracks in the tiles, passing back and forth over the body. Is it breathable? Yet I can't find a ray of light. Every day, I look at the dark coffin that brings in the [clang] [oh li gua] sounds, and the sobbing sounds of funerals never stop. And the earth-shaking vibrations of the giant wheels of the nearby large electrical factory shake this tired body all day long. It's like people are living in a turbulent, miserable fog all day long.</p>
<p>Ah, listen now to the long moans of the cold wind in the deep night, which has replaced the anger of the giant wheels of the electrical factory, surrounding and roaring. Harsh winter has already arrived, and I am still covered with a thin autumn quilt. Although I cover all the remaining single clothes tightly on top, I still can't stop my body from trembling all night long. Often in the middle of the night, I slowly take off my warm clothes from inside the quilt and twist them on my cold, stiff legs to keep warm. After a while, the upper body trembles again, unable to withstand the cold. Sometimes, I can't sleep all night, and I'm doing this work of fighting the cold.</p>
<p>Ah, under the tragic circumstances of this kind of life, I not only cannot rise up and roar angrily like the cold wind, but in this middle of the night, I put on my clothes, sit up, and sing this kind of sad tune. Am I not afraid of being ashamed? However, I can't help it. I tell you: I have already endured everything that can be endured, and I won't make such ugly groans. Ah, terrible sadness, I beg you to leave me from now on!</p>
<p>On this night a week ago, I also dreamed of your tearful scene that made me unable to stop crying. For years, my heart, which has been forged into steel from thousands of sorrows, couldn't help but shed tears all night long when I woke up. Ah, tell you: how much ridicule I have received from my friends for such tears! Now, who can I tell this time? Go away, you flickering! Don't give me any more shame with your ugly tears!</p>
<p>Ah! I tell you: You really don't need to disturb me anymore. Look: the night is long, and the dreams are endless! If this continues, when will I be able to complete my difficult journey? Ah, please forgive me, really don't disturb me anymore! Listen: the skinny dog lying next to me is also letting out a long, mournful howl in its dream. Let me go to sleep too! I used to say: Only in dreams will there be my peaceful rest. However, now I know that there is no rest or peace even in dreams. But I still can't help but let myself go to sleep. Just as when sorrow comes, although wine cannot dispel sorrow, one cannot help but drink.</p>
<p>Ah, cold wind that roars with anger, please be quiet for a while! Let me be quiet for a moment, even just a moment. Now, while the giant wheels of the nearby factory have stopped vibrating, let me take advantage of this rare opportunity to sleep well, so as to recover some fatigue. Waiting for the sky to dawn, I will grab myself up and work like a cow for others. I tell you: I am unwilling to see that short, ugly monster shooting out its sneering eyes that urge me.</p>
<h3>On Nathan Road</h3>
<p>— Li Ai</p>
<p>The plane leaves rustling the tune of autumn.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is dyed with the deep colors of autumn.</p>
<p>Emerging from the hospital, everything felt foreign. Like waking from a dream – a heart-wrenching sorrow!</p>
<p>Carrying a weary heart, I walked alone on Nathan Road.</p>
<p>The locust trees were old, standing anciently on the asphalt road; the autumn sunset, like melancholy pearls, gazed upon the steeple of the church, the chimneys of the factories, the aged locust trees; purple old waves rippled on the asphalt road; British sailors walked jauntily, arms swinging, whistling, whistling the tune of "Ramona," Spanish senoritas waited in front of the cinema – a quarter past seven. The eyes of the rickshaw pullers, like hungry wolves, prowled in the dark streets.</p>
<p>Pale yellow streetlights struggled in the twilight, red electric advertisements cast bloody shadows under the aged locust trees…</p>
<p>The Nathan Road at night is mad; my own heart is lonely.</p>
<p>Having fallen from the cutting edge of life, I climb up, struggle again, once, twice, three times... weary; unable to climb up, the hammer of life falls on my head, I rise in disarray, struggle... endlessly like this.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's present, on the wheel, will pass through a green ocean to a strange place. Over the years, hope has vanished with time, and a gray shadow has been painted into the chapters of my life. So often I have tried so hard to grasp! What I have grasped is but a wisp of smoke!</p>
<p>Oh, you who are weary of life!</p>
<p>[...The South, rippling with a lively atmosphere, the detestable colors have already tainted our pupils. Come quickly, cross the sea, here there is fresh air... Man, you should be certain: behind the harsh winter, there is the smile of spring, this is the era of [strength], this is the year of struggle...] Thinking of Luo's letter, like drinking a glass of brandy, I secretly thank him, this friend who encourages me.</p>
<p>In any case, I will leave tomorrow, although I am recovering from an illness; but for the sake of life, for the sake of new hope that is enticing me. Hong Kong, in my life's history, is a page of bloody impressions, indelible impressions, but tomorrow's present will become the past, the eternal past.</p>
<p>I raised my head: the sunset was buried by the night. The lamplight cast my shadow on Nathan Road, blurred; I looked at my blurred shadow...</p>
<p>A black shadow flashed past—</p>
<p>[Man, oh! It's you!] Two hands grabbed me.</p>
<p>I was startled.</p>
<p>Beneath the disheveled hair, two dark, large, sunken eyes flashed, a straight nose, a wide mouth, a coarse beard, set against a lean, rectangular face.</p>
<p>I stared in surprise for a while, unable to speak.</p>
<p>[Have you forgotten? It's me – Lao Tie.]</p>
<p>[Oh], like a hammer falling on my head, I almost fainted! I would never have thought Lao Tie would become like this!</p>
<p>We talked about the past, the present, the future... We lowered our heads, silently looking at our blurred shadows...</p>
<p>Five years ago, we were both young men, we had the same ideals, the same expectations for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I thought silently about the different encounters each of us had...</p>
<p>[Yu Man, I can't talk much longer]. He looked at his watch: [It's eight o'clock, I have to rush to catch the night boat home]. He ran frantically, I caught up and grabbed him:</p>
<p>[You still want to go home?] Home?</p>
<p>[Oh, where else can I go?] Fire flashed in his sunken eyes: [No relatives, no friends—! I want to find my mother, oh! I destroyed my mother's lifelong happiness. In the end, I am willing to destroy myself for her... Man, forgive me, I am ashamed, I understand everything, but I cannot understand myself...]. Each word seemed to pierce my heart like a sharp blade; when did he run off? I didn't know, I hastily raised my head and looked:</p>
<p>He was running frantically, his shadow blurring, mingling with the dark street; finally, he raised a hand in the darkness of the darkness:</p>
<p>[Man! Farewell, life is like smoke].</p>
<h3>Paradise Lost</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>Chinese people, especially modern Chinese people, often take "The present is not like the past" as a topic for their writings. Although it has become a cliché, there will still be many articles written about it. I am also Chinese, and I am more or less inevitably infected with this habit. How did I get this habit? Since when? I am really confused about it myself; I can't really explain it. If you must ask, I can only say that it started from losing paradise. The more I talk, the more bizarre it sounds. How could I possibly have a paradise? This is just intentionally exaggerating. The paradise we speak of is just the place where we played when we were young. This place may be very different from the paradise of heaven, because I have not yet been to the paradise of heaven, and I can't imagine what it is like, so I regard the place where I played as a child as paradise.</p>
<p>However, that paradise was lost without me knowing it, and because I don't have a paradise like heaven, I always think about that place with longing.</p>
<p>Villagers rarely have opportunities to entertain themselves throughout their lives, at least in my ancestral home that was the case. At the Dragon Boat Festival, they don't drink realgar wine. In mid-autumn, they don't admire the moon. On the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, during the "Ghost Festival," cities release river lanterns, but this is the countryside, without any organizations like "associations" or "societies," and there is no river, except for the customary burning of paper money when visiting graves, it is no different from ordinary days. Only on the Lantern Festival, children are overjoyed to get a paper lantern, and occasionally someone is willing to spend money to buy two small "firecrackers" to set off, which almost mobilizes the entire village. Playing dragon lanterns and setting off fireworks are things that even the elderly have never mentioned having done. This village is so small and so poor that it has never had anything big worth recording. The whole year is surrounded by a quiet atmosphere, and the situation can only be described as desolate and lonely.</p>
<p>However, the children are no different from those in other villages, and they never allow loneliness to weigh heavily on them, letting time pass in vain. The children will never sit by the adults, listening to them talk about the prices of rice, oil, and salt, anecdotes about certain scholars, or tales of ghosts and monsters, all of which are meaningless nonsense, unrelated to the hearts of the children. The children have their own world, which is on the threshing floor. Every year after autumn, the threshing floor is cleaned up and tidy, the moon shines on the bare and flat surface, and after dinner it becomes lively. This is the children's paradise.</p>
<p>Although it is just a threshing floor without any real or illusory changes, once it is occupied by the children, it will never be simple again. They can come up with many tricks, one of which is called "Old Turtle Sunning its Shell," which requires four people to stand upright at the four corners, with one person going up, stepping on the shoulders of the two people behind them, grabbing the shoulders of the two people in front of them, and running forward in one breath, somewhat similar to forming a human pyramid. There is also one called "Mouse Drilling Through the Circle," and many others that involve setting up defensive positions, answering questions back and forth, and then determining the winner based on the strength of their powers. Most places have the same games, only the names may be different. Since I am not doing research, I will not list them one by one. These games are mostly very childish, and the changes are very simple, but the village children play with all their hearts, and the sound of laughter and noise often startles the sleeping crows in the cold forest.</p>
<h3>The Fly (7)</h3>
<p>— By Pirandello, Translated by Xi Dichén</p>
<p>[We were to be married on the same day...! ]</p>
<p>[Don't be afraid, we will be married together!] Nelly said, while holding the man's head tightly.</p>
<p>At the same time, the doctor kept looking at the dying man, very clear, it was anthrax.</p>
<p>[Tell me, do you remember being bitten by an insect?]</p>
<p>[Didn't bite,] Chai Lu shook his head to indicate.</p>
<p>[Insect?] Salo asked.</p>
<p>The doctor explained the disease to the two farmers as best he could. It must be that some livestock died of anthrax. Who knows how many insects, perhaps swarming on that abandoned, stinking corpse in the ditch, and certainly one of them later flew around and transmitted the disease to Chai Lu who was lying in the stable.</p>
<p>As the doctor was saying this, Chai Lu turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p>No one knows it, but death is there; it is so small, so even if someone thought of looking for it, they simply could not detect it.</p>
<p>It is a fly, on that wall, seemingly motionless, but on closer inspection, one can see it sometimes expelling and sucking in its tiny sucking organ, and sometimes nimbly washing its two slender forelegs, rubbing them together, as if satisfied.</p>
<p>Chai Lu noticed it, staring tightly at it.</p>
<p>A fly –</p>
<p>Maybe it's this one, maybe it's another one. Who knows? Now that he hears the doctor mention it, he seems to remember. Indeed, when he was lying down here yesterday, waiting for his cousins to peel the almonds from Lopa, a fly had bothered him. Could it have been this one?</p>
<p>He saw it suddenly fly up, and he followed it with his eyes.</p>

<p>Flour Sales Lively, Standards Rising</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for all months showed a consistent and stable trend. Quotations for foreign wheat were around two to three jiao higher for Chicago wheat, and eight fen to one jiao higher for Canadian wheat. When the prices opened, the quotations for foreign wheat were good, and current sales were quite active. It is said that the Tianjin group found the routes around Ping Sui to be quite busy, so the standards were adjusted, and the market was very lively. Therefore, the opening price situation was already stable. As for the forward months, because there were not many factories making up for short positions, the asking prices were very stable, about one fen to one and a half fen higher than the closing prices of the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, the market was calm due to active spot sales in the current month. The forward months were also initially strong, but then the buying interest turned quiet, and the prices fell back. According to observations by people in the industry, it is feared that the recent good actual sales will make it difficult for prices to fall too much. As a result, the current month rose by 7.5 li, February was up by one fen, March was up by 2.25 fen, April was up by 1.5 fen, May was up by one fen, and June was up by 0.5 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Rise Then Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a trend of rising first and then falling in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Quotations for foreign wheat were around two to three jiao higher for Chicago wheat, and eight fen to one jiao higher for Canadian wheat. When the prices opened, the market was very active with buyers and few sellers, so the asking prices were secretly raised by three or four fen. March contracts jumped by as much as eight fen due to buyers competing to buy. However, the trading volume in each session was not very large. When the afternoon session opened, it was initially firm, but then the flour market softened slightly, and sellers suddenly poured out, and the trading volume in each session was also unusually active. As a final result, the current month fell by four fen, February fell by three fen, March rose slightly by one fen, and the rest were not opened. In the current wheat market, factories are mutually exclusive, and there is still no delivery seen.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: The visible supply announced on Monday is expected to have a large decrease. The need for spot and futures seemed to be improving when the price fell.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat January 4 January 5 Up/Down</p>
<p>May 99.75 100.75 Up 1.00</p>
<p>July 93.25 93.875 Up 0.625</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) A total of more than 30 groups arrived from various origins (with a total of nearly 6,000 shi of goods). Sales are still sluggish, and the situation is bland. The price of late rice has not changed much, only the thick japonica rice has been slightly raised due to the inferior source. People's sentiments no longer seem as firm as before. It is difficult to make a definitive statement about the current market situation and rely solely on the weather for a turnaround. Du Yang Jian is still lacking in goods and without a market, and Yin Bian Yuan is also just average.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, only about 10 shipments arrived from various ports downriver. In terms of market sales, green brokers sold to fellow traders first, which caused customers to enter the market very late. Sales were weak, and the market was dull. The market shape of white glutinous rice was firm in the early market but turned flat in the afternoon market. Yang Jian was raised and killed off the market quickly. It continued to rise by two or three jiao. The remaining goods were all stable.</p>
<p>Foreign Indica Rice Sales in the Mainland are Active Again</p>
<p>期洋米續有大批成交 期 Foreign Indica Rice Continues to See Large Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was originally stable, but due to the continuous arrivals these days, the previously determined prices will gradually offset the costs, and foreign merchants are very eager to sell. The current foreign rice is now at a small discount of five fen. As there is demand for forward rice in both this street and the mainland, although foreign merchants are selling as much as possible, they are unwilling to sell at low prices due to high costs. Therefore, market prices can still be maintained. Yesterday, 4,000 bags of spot goods were opened, and 4,800 tons of futures were sold by Yali Foreign Firm and 500 bags were sold by Dafu, with more volume in the distant April and May contracts.</p>
<p>客秈以上游水淺、成本加高、到頭不湧、而昨日内地胃口甚香、且本街亦有應酬、天津問津客元、崇沙辦砶米、無錫辦新糙米、故市　甚俏、行情步砌二三分、全市開出湖南沙市各米六千五百包、 Due to shallow upstream waters and higher costs, the arrival of goods of guest indica rice is not surging. Yesterday, the mainland demand was very strong, and there was also demand in this street. Tianjin inquired about guest yuan, Chongsha processed rough rice, and Wuxi processed new brown rice, so the market was very lively, and prices gradually rose by two or three fen. A total of 6,500 bags of various rice from Hunan and Shashi were offered in the city.</p>
<p>又訊、洋米午後略軟、近晚洋商續在求出、據云産價微降、故順全隆有近期四元八角二分之西貢五百　拋出、 Also, it is reported that foreign rice softened slightly in the afternoon, and foreign merchants continued to seek sales in the late evening. It is said that the production price has dropped slightly, so Shun Quan Long offered 500 units of Saigon rice at 4 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen for the near term.</p>
<p>A Quiet Bran Market</p>
<p>The bran market has been unusually quiet recently. Because foreign firms are inactive and large factories have accumulated bran, people are quiet and inactive. However, small factories' bran is selling relatively well in the mainland, so the market is stable. Currently, the prices of bran at various stalls are all quoted at 2 yuan and 7 jiao, with little difference.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 Pieces of Raw Sugar Offered in the Sugar Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, but the transaction volume of domestic raw sugar suddenly increased significantly, because the sales channels have gradually been activated. The guild's negotiated prices were: 24 raw granulated white sugar spot goods at 18 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, unchanged; re-export bonded warehouse goods at 5 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen, up 3 fen; 89 grade Dutch red sugar spot goods at 13 yuan and 9 jiao; Taikoo Sugar B mark at 19 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, up 5 fen; this factory's first-grade refined white sugar at 18 yuan and 1 jiao. At the market opening, Guangdong merchants offered more than 4,000 boxes of sliced green sugar at 9 yuan each, and more than 500 units of strip green sugar at 9 yuan and 3 jiao each. Chaozhou merchants offered more than 6,000 bags of Chaozhou green sugar at 10 yuan and 5 jiao to 9 yuan and 6 jiao each. Because Ningbo and Wuxi merchants were actively buying in large quantities yesterday, and the land price in Shantou was reported to have risen, the market was enthusiastic and the transaction volume suddenly became lively.</p>

<p>A Wave of Bullish News Drives Speculation Up by $11.4</p>
<p>▲U.S. Government Considers Changing Silver Policy</p>
<p>The gold market had been repeatedly falling for days due to the wavering of the bullish front. Unexpectedly, yesterday, bullish news flooded the market, boosting buying interest and vigorous price increases. Sentiment remained strong. However, it weakened briefly due to a strengthening exchange rate. Early morning overseas silver markets showed flat prices in both England and America, while forward silver prices rose. Exchange rates fluctuated. London spot gold fell by 5.5 pence, but sentiment improved. This was due to reports in the Japanese press that the Central Bank was shipping a large quantity of gold bars for export, valued at £500,000, to be transferred to Hong Kong for exchange into silver. The reason was the recent extreme tightness of the silver market and lack of cash buyers, leading to unusually low reserves, which directly affected the gold market significantly. Now that the Central Bank has begun shipping large quantities for export, it will inevitably alleviate pressure in the market, and the silver market is expected to see some improvement. Speculators may not be overly embarrassed when settling their positions. Initial off-market bids were for $56.7, but few were willing to sell. Major firms like Hengyu, Futaiheng, and Dadecheng actively bought, quickly pushing the price up to $63. Hengchangyong and Yongli sold at the higher price. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, showing flat prices in England and America. The Customs Gold Unit further contracted by 6 li, and the standard speculative gold price retreated to.</p>
<p>Various rumors circulated regarding the Central Bank shipping 10,000 taels of cash and opening spot positions. Demand in the market exceeded supply, driving prices higher. However, because many were eager to sell at the high price and the exchange rate was stable, prices fluctuated and then declined. Banks showed a greater appetite for US dollars than British pounds, briefly pushing the price close to the $60 mark, but buying interest remained strong, allowing prices to rebound after the dip. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged at 6.25%. While the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5.75 pence did not have a significant impact, major firms continued to buy. Prices then rallied again. However, due to the easing exchange rate and active supply from merchants, prices gradually fell. Major firms repeatedly sold heavily. Even those who were holding positions were forced to capitulate due to the rigid domestic market. The $60 mark could not be maintained, and bullish sentiment was shaken. The market weakened. However, because the initial rise had been too rapid and buying desires had not been fully satisfied, activity returned after the dip, and prices gradually recovered. At noon, the market appeared stable, fluctuating around the $60 level, as rumors circulated that the Central Bank was opening cash positions and importing gold bars. In the afternoon, the market immediately rose above $60. The rumors of cash opening intensified, and buyers flocked in. Western firms like 克萊 (Kèlái) also bought, causing a sudden surge. Sentiment improved further after the opening, and prices continued to rise. However, because major firms were dumping at the high price and banks were still selling, prices retreated. Due to the weakening exchange rate, buying interest remained strong. The initial reduction in Indian silver was three annas, and prices managed to hold after the dip. Later, a Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that, according to recent dispatches from Shanghai, the U.S. government might be willing to change its silver policy, reducing silver purchases and lowering the silver content of coins to alleviate the hardship suffered by China. This bullish news triggered another surge, but because supply remained abundant at the high price and the Western firm 克萊 (Kèlái) was also closing positions, and banks were selling, Indian silver rebounded by one anna a second time, gradually falling back. However, buying interest had not been extinguished, and the market closed strong. Throughout the day, demand exceeded supply, buying interest revived, and there were occasional dips. Bullish activity was also strong, leading to an optimistic trend. Below is a record of the day's market activity:</p>

Hengyu bought and then sold, resulting in a flat price. At this time, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's rates were announced, showing flat British rates and a U.S. dollar increase of .0625, causing market fluctuations. Dadecheng and Changda were forced to sell, pushing prices down to $1.1. Shunmao and Hengchangyong aggressively bought bullion, raising prices to $2.5. However, because 安達 (Āndá) and Mitsui were selling February shillings at 5.625, Qianchangxiang, Yongli, Yifengyong, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, and others sold, causing prices to fall to $.01.

Shunli, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Dafayong, and Zhaofengchang bought again. 華比 (Huábǐ) bought February U.S. dollars at .0625, raising prices to $7. Qianchangxiang, Yuanyi, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, and others sold at the higher price. Mitsui sold March shillings at 3.375, retreating to $4.5.

After the close, prices continued to rise above $7.5. The highest price of the day was $968.8, and the lowest price was $957.95, a fluctuation of $11.3. The final result was a rebound of $11.4 from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard speculative gold price, fell again to $989.6, approximately $23 from the closing price, a decrease of more than $14 from last Saturday. The registered price for this month is $946, and for February, it is $960. The registered price for the afternoon market is $953 for this month and $969.9 for February.

<p>The selling price required an additional $2. Rumors were rampant regarding the Central Bank opening and importing spot goods, but they were not confirmed by spot dealers.

However, it was widely rumored that the Central Bank had opened and imported a significant amount of speculative gold in both the morning and afternoon markets, totaling over 1,000 pieces, handled by Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Ruikang, and Fuchang.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates were announced, showing flat British rates and a U.S. dollar increase of .0625.

Afterwards, the banks' appetite remained strong, and the Chinese merchants' appetite turned sluggish. The process gradually became loose. The market tightened again in the afternoon due to rumors of positive developments. However, banks continued to sell at the higher price, causing some fluctuations. The initial report of Indian silver shrinking was 3 annas, and the psychology of Chinese merchants remained strong. In addition, a Reuters dispatch reported that the U.S. was reducing silver purchases and lowering the silver content of coins, and the process remained tight. Later, because banks were still selling, Indian silver rebounded by one anna and prices were slightly flat. The closing near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 4.875 pence for British pounds and $34.6875 for U.S. dollars, showing a tightening of 1.5625 for British pounds and .25 for U.S. dollars compared to last Saturday.

<p>Rumors Dissipate, Bond Market Reverses</p>
<p>丨Three to Six Jiao Better Than Saturday丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange market seemed to have improved slightly. The unfounded rumors that had been circulating were confirmed to be completely false, and foreign call loans had also eased somewhat. Market sentiment was stable, and many short positions that had been accumulated over several days were gradually being covered, along with some arbitrage transactions. As a result, sentiment turned bullish, and the trend appeared strong. If foreign call loans continue to ease, there is hope for improvement in market prices. Throughout yesterday, the opening in the morning was due to the foreign call loan rate only being quoted at 4 jiao 8 fen, a retreat of 7 fen from the previous day. Sentiment turned stable, and the rumors that had been circulating on Saturday were confirmed to be unfounded. Scattered buying and swap transactions were not quiet. The 編遣 (biānqiǎn) bonds immediately rose by 4 jiao 5 fen, and the 裁兵 (cáibīng) bonds rose by half a yuan. The trend remained strong throughout. Although the 北帮 (Běibāng) sold, the market price was not suppressed. Afterwards, the 23rd issue rose by more than 6 jiao 5 fen. In the second session, some long positions were slightly closed out, and another round of arbitrage began. Although selling in the 11th issue surged, the market price still slowly rose. The back issues, such as the 整六 (zhěngliù), showed signs of weakness. Under normal circumstances, a rebound could have been expected in the afternoon. However, the call loan rate in the afternoon was only 2 jiao 8 fen, a rapid decline compared to before. Sentiment revived again. The 裁兵 (cáibīng) bonds continued to rise by 3 jiao, and the back issues also improved slightly. At the close, the temporary long positions on the floor were slightly closed out, retreating slightly by about 5 fen or 1 jiao. Afterwards, the 47th issue was actively bought in the afternoon, rising sharply by 3 jiao. The trend was strong and stable. Even if it does not continue to rise, it will fluctuate for a while. In summary, the result of the day's market prices was that they were 3 to 6 or 7 jiao higher than Saturday. The total transaction volume was 13,200,500 yuan, and 10 shares of stock. The results of the highs, lows, rises, and falls are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share):</p>

<p>Raw Cotton Speculative Yarn Fluctuates Normally</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm. Overseas cotton markets are trending downward, and sentiment has declined slightly. However, the large holdings of the Tongji and Tongcheng companies remain unchanged, and the market has not seen significant changes. Sales of spot yarn can still be maintained.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Nearly Stable, Far Off Declines</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the raw cotton speculative yarn market, it was expected that there would be a price decline, as foreign cotton had fallen sharply, with near-term declines of 3-4 jiao and far-term declines of 5-6 jiao. By the second or third round of auctions, rumors were rampant in the market, saying that representatives from Chinese yarn factories were very busy. Another rumor said that a meeting was being held somewhere, with a proposal to reduce production in yarn factories. However, a thorough investigation by the reporter found that there was no need to stop or reduce production. Although one factory had stopped production, it was due to internal reasons or organizational restructuring. Market prices rose slightly as a result. The result was that the current month rose by 4 jiao, March rose by 1 jiao, and the other months fell by 3-4 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that purchasing of spot yarn by the Hunan and Guangdong gangs was still smooth, and market sentiment was slightly calm. All months rose by 1-2-3 jiao. Sales included 950 bales from Dafeng, 750 bales from Yuanda, 550 bales from Ruida, 350 bales from Zhenda, 500 bales from Yicheng, 700 bales from Runkang, 350 bales from Jifeng, 500 bales from Tongji, 400 bales from Shenji, 750 bales from Yuanyi, 700 bales from Changfeng, and 1,950 bales from Gengfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Speculative Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Number of Contracts</p>
<p>January 184.4 183.2 184.4 Up 0.60 38,900</p>
<p>February 185.3 184.4 185.3 Up 0.30 45,300</p>
<p>March 187.0 186.3 187.0 Up 0.40 54,400</p>
<p>April 188.1 187.7 188.0 Down 0.20 53,150</p>
<p>May 188.8 188.1 188.5 Up 0.30 29,150</p>
<p>June 189.3 188.8 188.2 Down 0.40 2,850</p>
<p>Total 233,850</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Strong at 1,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are still good. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 1,015 bales for the day. Market conditions were weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi 15 Inland 110 Datong 10</p>
<p>Changsha 430 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 395 Yunnan 40</p>
<p>Speculative Raw Cotton with Reduced Production in the Air</p>
<p>The cotton market declined slightly. Indian cotton continued to fall, and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. American cotton was also weak, and sentiment became softer. Talk of yarn factories reducing production became more intense, and the market was even harder to stabilize. However, Tongcheng continued to buy more during the dips, and the speculative gold price</p>
<p>is slightly higher. New sellers are not seen to be active.</p>
<h3>Speculative Zheng Cotton Declines Slightly</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the speculative raw cotton market, most people expected a decline of several jiao, as American cotton was trending downward, and the decline in Indian cotton was accelerating, causing weakness in sentiment. Rumors of yarn factories stopping production resurfaced. However, new sellers were not active in the market. In fact, when Indian cotton had risen step by step the day before, the speculative raw cotton market was also calm and did not follow the rise, so there were not many floating long positions on the floor that were eager to close out.

<h3>Women Not Allowed to Flirt</h3>
<p>— Impotent</p>
<p>["Of the myriad remaining, not even a sliver remains. I've rarely seen such a delightful woman. My eyes are dazzled, my words fail me, my soul flies away for half a day."]</p>
<p>These are Zhang Junrui's first words upon seeing Yingying in the "Amazing Encounter" scene of the Romance of the Western Chamber. I think at that time, Yingying was in mourning attire and didn't particularly dress up in a "delicately charming" manner. Yet, this Mr. Zhang Junrui was so captivated at first sight that he was utterly infatuated and obsessed. Zhang was truly a hungry ghost for beauty. If Cui Yingying had donned gorgeous clothes, applied rouge and powder, and dressed like those "promiscuous young ladies" who frequent hotels and game halls, I wonder how Mr. Zhang Junrui would have been "possessed" upon seeing her? No, Zhang Junrui would definitely turn his head away and leave such a woman, and the events that followed wouldn't have occurred. The Romance of the Western Chamber wouldn't have been able to continue.</p>
<p>My mind is also very stubborn, and my tolerance is quite narrow, unlike some places where if the mistress of the house goes out as a guest or shopping and no one follows her, the black lacquer bench becomes very unhappy and looks down on her. In the past, when my yellow-faced wife went out, even though she didn't wear any strange or gorgeous clothes, she always put on some rouge and powder, and I was very dissatisfied. Once, when the mistress of the house went out, she naturally did as usual, and I was so annoyed that I questioned her. ["You usually don't put on rouge and powder at home, but you must put on rouge and powder when you go out. What's the reason for that? If you put on some powder at home, that's understandable, but if you must put on rouge and powder when you go out, it's simply of questionable intent."] My yellow-faced wife was truly speechless after being questioned by me, and she smiled and said, ["If I go out looking disheveled, it doesn't seem appropriate. What's the reasoning behind that? I won't apply rouge and powder when I go out anymore." I think to myself, my views are not in line with modern trends, but I'm confident that my reasoning isn't bad.]</p>
<p>According to a news report, ["The Public Security Bureau of Ping City, acting on the instructions of the municipal government, reported that a citizen, Chen Shaowang, stated that recently, there have been some women who engage in the trick of seducing young men in public places all day long. Please take measures to ban them," etc.] Indeed, all young men are in the midst of sexual urges, so how can they withstand the temptation of charming and beautiful women? However, according to Chen Shaowang, these are mostly women without occupations who make a living by engaging in prostitution, or women who pretend to be students while secretly flaunting their youth. One type of woman is driven by economic pressure, while the other is driven by sexual desire. I think that for those who are forced to resort to flirting due to economic pressure, there may be some justification. As for those in academic circles who are said to be like secret prostitutes, they must be a very small number of bad elements, and it's definitely not a widespread phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, I deeply observe that in society, those who wear flamboyant clothes and flirt are not limited to the above two types of people. Whether from prominent families or small households, whether grandmothers or young ladies, I dare not say they're all flirting, but their strange and gorgeous clothes attract onlookers, and there's reliable evidence for this. I ask, what are their motivations? I dare not make wild guesses. Even in terms of material things, the losses are countless. Not to mention rouge, face powder, lipstick, etc., even in terms of clothing, they must be changed every six months. What's long in the first half of the year becomes short in the second half of the year, what's big in the second half of the year becomes small in the first half of the year, and whatever silk is popular now, they'll make something out of that silk, and in another six months, they'll make something out of another silk. I ask, how can this account be calculated?</p>
<p>Or some may say that it's understandable for young ladies to do this, but what is the purpose of grandmothers doing it? According to those who understand women's psychology, men often like women who are flirtatious and attract attention, so they use flamboyant means to win over their husbands as a way to resist inferior goods. Whether these words are true or not, I still have some doubts.</p>
<h3>Wine and Women</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The wine in Zhu Lao San's stomach was generating a fire-like heat. His face flushed crimson, and his nerves were in disarray. In his memory, in his fiery red eyes, there was only that woman, the woman living on the second floor.</p>
<p>Madly, he muttered to himself, yelling and cursing. Suddenly, he cried, but when he was crying fiercely, he suddenly laughed again. He told stories to the person sitting in front of him, and he cursed at the person sitting in front of him. Although when he was making too much noise, the guard standing outside the wooden fence would impatiently open the door, using great force to strike him with the bamboo whip in his hand, cursing him harshly. But to Zhu Lao San, who was spewing the smell of wine from his mouth, it didn't seem to matter. He didn't know that there was a fierce god standing in front of him, scolding him and wielding a thick bamboo whip, that his hands and feet were shackled with iron rings, and that all around him were thick wooden bars. He didn't know the lack of freedom and the pain inflicted on him. He continued to yell, curse, laugh, and cry. In his mind, he had no idea that this was a place where there was absolutely no freedom, where absolutely no one could be free. His clamor was something that a person who had lost their freedom wouldn't have.</p>
<p>The time had reached dusk, and the sky was a somber black. The faces of the people inside the wooden fence were blurred and hard to see. The guard standing outside the gate was also impatiently waving the bamboo whip in his hand, pacing back and forth with heavy steps, the sound of his leather shoes clanging.</p>
<p>One hundred, two hundred pairs of eyes flickered beside the wooden fence. These flickering eyes naturally focused on the guard walking back and forth, as if telling him: ["It's getting late, and we're all still hungry!"] But it was all in vain. The guard who was pacing and smoking a cigarette didn't seem to notice at all. He just kept reaching into his pocket to take out his watch, checking to see if it was time for his shift to change. He didn't pay any attention to the hungry eyes focused on him.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Lao San felt that his head weighed a thousand pounds. Drowsy, his vision went black, and he fell to the floor without knowing anything. He fell asleep just like that on the hard floor.</p>
<p>The north wind whistled in from outside the wooden fence. Zhu Lao San felt a chill all over his body and woke up from his drunken dream. When he opened his eyes, he was very strange and very scared. What on earth was this place? Why did he come here and lie down on the floor to sleep?</p>
<p>His nerves gradually cleared, and his eyes kept looking around under the dim light. He remembered very clearly that he had been eating and drinking in a restaurant at noon today. Why? Why did he end up lying here tonight? This was definitely not the place he wanted to come to!</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Lao San wanted to stand up, but he realized that his hands and feet were shackled with iron rings. He understood in his heart that he must have committed some crime. At this time, he could only sit there blankly thinking, recalling what had happened after lunch today.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, after Zhu Lao San finished lunch, he walked home from the restaurant. He had drunk too much wine, and he always staggered when he walked. When he got home, he didn't know why, but he ran up to the second floor to Mrs. Wang's room. He went mad, he went to hug her, to caress her, to [censored]. But Mrs. Wang cried out. He was vaguely caught by the people who broke into the room from outside, and after that, he didn't know anything.</p>
<p>Zhu Lao San tried hard to recall again, but he couldn't remember what happened after he was caught. He thought, he looked at his clothes. At this time, he realized that his clothes were torn, and there was a faint pain on his back and legs. Only then did he begin to understand what had happened to him today, all because of wine and women.</p>
<p>The gloomy shadows of the night were deeply imprinted on the ground outside the wooden fence. There was no light at all, only the piercing wind was blowing, sending cold air to the people inside the wooden fence. Looking at the pitch-black sky, it looked like it was about to rain. At this time, Zhu Lao San sank into recollection.</p>
<h3>Two Yellow Comic Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>Comics have indeed become popular in China recently, and in the art of painting, comics do occupy a considerable position. Moreover, the power of comics may be greater than that of general pictures. They can satirize society, inspire thought, and everything else is perhaps beyond the reach of purely aesthetic pictures.</p>
<p>Because comics themselves have a kind of humorous tone, they are often regarded by some people as clowns on the stage and are overlooked. In fact, a comic has the potential to make you cry, laugh, feel sentimental, and sympathize! Therefore, I think the comic exhibition in Shanghai, although it is the first time it has been held, is worth visiting.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the fourth floor of the Continental Shopping Mall, turning a corner from the elevator is the first room of the comic exhibition, which is entirely the work of Huang Shiying, with a total of sixty-four works. The four walls are hung full of exhibits, truly a feast for the eyes!</p>
<p>We acknowledge that comics, like newspapers, are a mirror that reflects society. In a fragmented society like China, the society reflected in comics is, of course, also fragmented, and comic artists are, of course, dissatisfied with society. Therefore, among the sixty-four works, many can be found that reflect the fragmented state of society.</p>
<p>[Taking Risks], [Plowing on an Empty Stomach], [The Fate of the Poor], [The Hunger Riot], [Unemployment], [Refugees], [The Cry of Life], [Inspection of Disaster Areas], [Crying from Hunger and Cold]—don't these works depict the bankruptcy of Chinese villages and the economic downturn of cities? [The Landlord's Tour], [The Decline of a Large Family], [Illegitimate Child], [Brothel Mother's Whip], [Discovery of a Woman's Photo], [After Being Full]—several works have also depicted the current Chinese society, the old ethics, and various contradictions. [The Colonial Tide], [The Roar of the Oppressed People]—these works depict the suffering of oppressed people under the iron heel of imperialism. When we see [The Night of the Great Wall], we will think of the lost territory in Northeast China. When we see [Ronin], we will think of the activities of Japanese ronin in Shanghai during the January 28th Incident. Here, it is enough for us to experience the potential in these works. The author further uses his keen thinking and humorous style to do his best to satirize and guide society and the country.</p>
<p>Arriving in the second room, the seventy-four comics here are entirely the work of Huang Ding. In Huang Ding's works, there are naturally many that expose the fragmented state of Chinese society. [The Ordeal of Debt Evaders], [Debt Collection], [The Landlord is Coming], [Difficulty Eating], [Hungry People Shouting Outside the Window], [Country People Being Fooled]—these works depict the bankruptcy of rural and urban areas and the downturn of the economy even more completely. In addition, there are as many as eighteen sketches in the entire collection, with street scenes, scenery, and portraits as the main themes. In addition, [Imperialism in Zhong,</p>
<p>[Concession Combination Line], etc., are several comics that powerfully arouse national spirit.</p>
<p>Looking at the comics of Huang Shiying and Huang Ding, their composition and brushwork each have their own style, and all of their works are skilled and content are worthy of being called above the standard. Finally, I hope that this comic exhibition will call attention to cartoonists across the country.</p>
<h3>Pawned, Awaiting Redemption</h3>
<p>— Prison City</p>
<p>When I was studying, I didn't understand what pawnshops were all about. But in recent years, the pawnshops that are lined up in Shanghai are very familiar. Because the number of times I and my poor friends have gone to pawnshops has increased day by day, and seeing the number of unemployed and impoverished people in society increasing day by day, I thought that the business of pawnshops should be better. But recently</p>
<h3>Impressions of Reading the Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's drawing omitted the title [Starting Over]</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>Recently, I have seen several pawnshop doors with red paper and black characters, which are particularly eye-catching: [Pawned, Awaiting Redemption]. Moreover, they are mostly large and very famous pawnshops, which makes people feel suspicious. When I asked a more knowledgeable friend, he laughed at me for being ignorant and strange, and said that the situation was more than that. Once, they almost all closed down completely! This made me even more stunned. The reason is that there are really more and more people going to pawnshops, but pawning without redeeming is the fatal wound of pawnshops. Therefore, they have to [Pawned, Awaiting Redemption], and the reason is here. Although pawnshops like more people to pawn things and the business is more lively, their main purpose is to seek high profits. If I pawn something worth ten dollars, they will charge me one dollar in interest in just six months. If I can redeem it, this kind of business can prosper. If I can't redeem it and it's left as inventory, the boss's capital can't circulate in the current widespread economic downturn and the phenomenon of prices falling day by day, and there's no way out.</p>
<p>From this small phenomenon, we can see more clearly! People's poverty is becoming more and more profound. Especially in the prosperity of big cities, it reveals its latent crisis even more. Now everything is being pawned due to the decline of the pawnshop industry's [Pawned, Awaiting Redemption], and the price of pawns is still increasing, but there are still more people going to pawnshops, but it can be imagined that it is even more impoverished situation, since they pawn more and get less money, and have no power to redeem it? Otherwise, it would never be willing to sacrifice high-priced goods and be unwilling to buy them out at a low price.</p>

<p>There are really many dirty nannies. Go to the broker shop to while away the time. Worn clothes with missing buttons ask people to mend. The sleeves are full of white lice. Some have disheveled hair that hasn't been combed for two months. Some have a pair of stinky feet that are about to breed maggots. Some drag beggars on the street. The waxy yellow hand grime is three points thick. Some have yellow soybean-thick eye corners. Some people run to the vegetable market carrying broken baskets. Full of fishy smell like rotten coriander. Most ridiculous, after pouring out the chamber pot, they wipe it with their shirt. Leaving behind fecal stains as mottled as a hundred lucky patterns. Flirting with the Jiangbei Old. Not spending a dime to call her husband. Dressed up with painted powder like a ghost. Unspeakable flirtatiousness, the face is like a night witch. Red heads and black charcoal often patronize. Moments of pleasure are like a fleshy night kettle. It can be counted as a soul-destroying hell on earth.</p>

<p>Cut bamboo from the Southern Mountain for the bili, This music originally came from Kucha,</p>
<p>Flowing through the Han land, the tune turns strange, A Cool Prefecture barbarian plays it for me.</p>
<p>Neighbors who hear it often sigh; Distant travelers thinking of home all shed tears.</p>
<p>The world understands listening but doesn't understand appreciating, In the long hall, it comes and goes by itself in the wind.</p>
<p>The dry mulberry and old cypress are cold and soughing, Nine Phoenixes sing in a chaotic chirp.</p>
<p>Dragon roars and tiger howls erupt at once; Ten thousand sounds and a hundred springs meet autumn together.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (2)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(2) Leland Stanford's Production of Linked Films</p>
<p>Many years ago, there was a Griffith (D.W. Griffith), who was originally an actor in vaudeville. He suddenly set up a very simple small film studio in New York and began shooting moving pictures. His speed of production was truly astonishing, producing approximately one film per week. Later, he ran to New Jersey and filmed many wilderness westerns. Because he did not have much money and hired mostly extras, the actors he used had to play several roles in one film, being used three or four times a day to make it count. Therefore, the Indians attacked by cowboys were often played by those who played the cowboys, and the Indian woman sitting in front of the bonfire, only seen from the back, was probably Griffith's own wife or a friend of his wife.</p>
<p>At that time, Griffith had no idea that his talent would later become world-renowned, shining globally in such blockbusters as (Birth of a Nation). How could he have foreseen that the girl he hired, earning three dollars a day, would later become "America's Sweetheart" and is now a Hollywood social leader, Mary Pickford? One day, Mary Pickford led two apprehensive girls to the film studio and asked Griffith to give them some work to do as well. At the time, Griffith did not anticipate that one of them would later become one of the greatest film actors of her generation, the protagonist of famous films such as "Two Orphans," Lillian Gish. In Griffith's eyes at that time, he could not see what was so great about Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish. To him, they were just some lively and active girls.</p>
<p>Returning to matters before Griffith, we can mention Leland Stanford. He unintentionally laid the foundation for one of America's six largest enterprises, but he did not know it. One evening after a banquet, he brought up a theory that a horse's four hooves are simultaneously off the ground when running at top speed. This statement does not seem strange to us today, because we have seen it many times in sports films or war films. But at that time, one of the guests present did not believe his theory. So Stanford argued with that person. Neither would give way, and they finally made a bet. Stanford wanted to prove that his theory was correct in order to win the bet. Unwittingly, this led to the beginning of moving pictures.</p>
<p>Stanford was a wealthy man. He was also an athlete skilled in horsemanship. Having made a bet with a friend, he devoted himself to winning it. He wanted to use photography to prove his idea, but after taking photos for many years, the results were not very satisfactory. Finally, he met a photographer named John D. Isaacs, who gave him an idea that could prove his theory, but could also show that his theory was wrong. He told Stanford to place dozens of cameras in a row on the ground, and use a kind of electrical mechanism to make the fast horse walk past the front of the camera boxes, with many camera boxes opening the lens covers in sequence, capturing the real situation on the ground one by one. The result of this experiment was a row of linked photographs, and the different positions of the horse's hooves were clearly visible.</p>
<p>Stanford examined each of the photos and knew that his theory was correct. He showed them to his friend and received the wagered money. In 1882, he published a book about the entire affair, and the money for printing the book was also the money won from the bet. After that, he forgot all about it. But these photographs were the first motion pictures, the first photographs to show the motion of an object. If it were not for that bet, perhaps we would not be able to see Clark Gable or Marlene Dietrich today. Isn't this a very strange industrial anecdote? Of course, Stanford did not know that he had invented something new. After his book was published, the minds of many inventors were spurred by his experiment and began to work frantically. They felt that the method of photographing with many linked camera boxes was not enough. They began to think about using one camera box to continuously shoot multiple films. At this time, the great inventor Edison also felt a peculiar interest in this matter. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>Review of [The Big Road]</h3>
<p>— Lü Yi</p>
<p>The life of workers is painful and monotonous. The author of [The Big Road] uses two young girls to adjust their lives, encourage them, make them forget the hardships of work, and make their spirits active. This is indeed very ideal. But the poet's ideal is always beautiful. Every scene and every shot here is full of poetic sentiment and the emotion of painting. Poetry and painting weave the picture.</p>
<p>The first half of the drama's tone is light, and then gradually becomes tense as the story progresses. Until Jin Ge and others are imprisoned and beaten, the atmosphere on the screen and in the sound is very tight and oppressive, which is indeed a successful effect.</p>
<p>The author's clear division of each character's personality is also not to be ignored. Jin Ge's intelligence and bravery, Lao Zhang's silence and suspicion, Zhang Da's recklessness and straightforwardness, Xiao Liu Zi's weakness and incompetence, and Zheng Jun's intellectual class style are all appropriately expressed, without any contradiction or excessiveness. The music accompanying the drama's relaxation is very appropriate and harmonious, which also helps a lot with the drama's appeal.</p>
<h3>My Review of [The Big Road]</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The subject matter and significance of [The Big Road] show the importance of our country's current construction work, and also demonstrate the greatness of the masses' united strength. Although, under the interlocking oppression of imperialism and evil forces, heavy obstacles are used to hinder the work of the big road, it is finally overcome and ultimately successful because of the efforts of the masses themselves, their strong fighting spirit, and their indomitable courage.</p>
<p>However, I feel that there is still room for discussion, that is, whether this is an accurate portrayal of reality? The road workers' rejection of bribes and willingness to be tortured, the attitude of calmly facing death, and Li Lili and Chen Yanyan's resourcefulness and bravery in using the "beauty trap," are these real facts in the world? It makes people somewhat doubtful.</p>
<p>In this film, we hear the two tragic and passionate songs "[Road Opener]" and "[The Big Road]," which completely ignite the inner blood. Everything is a bright, cheerful, and energetic manifestation. Although the work only has sincere and earnest expectations, and has not yet earnestly sought the light of the future, its spirit is commendable enough.</p>
<p>"The Merry Widow" starring Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier (today is the last day for this film to be screened)</p>
<h3>Impressions After Seeing [The Big Road]</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>I think [The Big Road] is a film that contains excitement from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The director's efforts can be seen in every scene, light and powerful, such as Dingxiang kneading dough while moving her feet in time with the rhythm of [The Big Road Song]. Another example is the scene when Han Xiaoliuzi is arrested for stealing beef, Molly putting corn silk in her mouth, and the liveliness of Dingxiang and Molly. Intense scenes such as the road workers being beaten by the foreman, Jin Ge's conflict with the foreman, Dingxiang and Molly using the "beauty trap," the drunken Hufu, Jin Ge cutting the rope with scissors on the ground, and using his toes to pick up the scissors are all the most tense and clever places in the entire film for the director. The lyrics of several songs also help to make the entire film wonderful.</p>
<p>Some of the director's techniques seem to adopt those of [Song of the Fishermen], such as using the lyrics of the songs to perform the mood in the scenes. [The Big Road Song], [Road Opener], [Fengyang Song], and [Song of the Fishermen] are somewhat similar. The director handled the entire film lightly, tensely, and even humorously. However, the director's handling of several extras in the performance is not very powerful.</p>
<p>Actors such as Zhang Yi's silent and resolute performance, Jin Yan's cheerful performance, and Han Langen's playful performance are all successful. Chen Yanyan is indeed lovable, but in the last section when she goes to report, her gait is not tight enough, and her face also lacks a tense expression. Shang Guanwu and Zhang Zhizhi are quite good. Zheng Junli is competent, and the other actors are also quite hardworking.</p>
<p>The dubbing is very good. The photography is clear.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from [Rebirth Flower]</h3>
<p>— Huo</p>
<p>△... Hu Die plays two roles in [Rebirth Flower]: Da Bao is a pitiful poor woman, and Er Bao is a noble lady. Hu Die has achieved a mastery of perfection in portraying the opposite expressions of this poverty and wealth. And the most difficult expression to perform is the transition from a sad face to a smiling face, and then from a smiling face back to a sad face. This was often seen during the filming of [Rebirth Flower].</p>
<p>△... Xuan Jinglin can be considered the most hardworking person in [Rebirth Flower]. This old mother usually sits in the film studio, and she doesn't care about the noise in the studio at all, as if she is sitting in another world, constantly whispering with director Zheng Zhengqiu about the expression of each shot. She is so hardworking, it is no wonder that she is praised by the vast audience.</p>
<p>△... In order to make the plot of [Rebirth Flower] more realistic, Zheng Xiaoqiu and Mei Xi were whipped all over their bodies with the warlord's leather whip until they turned purple, and this sacrifice obviously had great gains and great value, didn't it? The most touching scene in [Rebirth Flower] is this scene.</p>
<p>▲... Audiences who have seen [Twin Sisters] probably know that Er Bao (played by Hu Die) had a lover before marrying Commander Qian. That lover was a progressive revolutionary youth. In [Rebirth Flower], it will tell you the life of this youth.</p>
<p>▲... In [Twin Sisters], Da Bao was arrested and imprisoned for killing Commander Qian's sister. The next day, Da Bao's mother went to visit her in prison and learned that the prison officer Zhao De was Zhao Da, and his wife Jianying was Er Bao. As a result, Er Bao was moved by great ethics and forcibly took Da Bao out of prison. This is still the plot of [Twin Sisters]. What happens afterwards? Please see the currently released [Rebirth Flower] (but)</p>

<h3>Policeman Rides the Dragon (White Lies) (4)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Oliver nodded, indicating that he could take the phone. Mitchell then grabbed the telephone receiver. He heard his secretary's voice saying, "Captain Taylor is outside and wants to see you." Mitchell heard this and couldn't remember who Taylor was for a moment. After thinking for a while, he remembered that it was the bold policeman who had now been promoted to captain. He had come at just the right time, and he couldn't help but feel refreshed. He then pretended to be nonchalant and said, "Tell him to wait. I'm very busy. I'll ring the bell when I want to see him." After saying that, he hung up the phone. Oliver shouted, "Put your hands on the table, or I'll shoot." They then stared at each other in a daze. After a while, Mitchell pointed to the cigarette box on his desk and asked Oliver if he smoked. While Oliver was paying attention, and accidentally not on guard, Mitchell gently raised one leg and used his knee to press the electric bell under the table. A second later, a fully armed young police officer jumped in. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and had piercing eyes. When Joan saw him, her heart couldn't help but flutter. It turned out that this was Taylor Camden. When Oliver saw a police officer running in, he immediately became uneasy. But Camden calmly said to him, "Why don't you put down that gun? Aren't you just adding to your crimes?" As he spoke, he put one hand on Oliver's hand holding the gun and effortlessly snatched the gun away. Oliver helplessly fell into the chair and cried miserably.</p>
<p>At this time, Mitchell suddenly forgot about them, and suddenly regained his original identity as a fierce news reporter. He shouted loudly, "Hend! Roberts! Call the printing room! Tell them to stop working! Tell them to take off the cover and replace it with a new one! 'Attempted Murder in the Newsroom!' This is the biggest news of the year!" The entire newspaper office immediately went crazy with busyness. In the midst of everyone's busyness, Joan looked at Camden with affection and said, "Don't blame my dad. He's always like this." Mitchell said to Camden distractedly, "You're really something. That was really fun. Please come and see me when you have time, or I won't be so busy. You should know that today's events are the best news." As he said this, he reached out to grab the phone. Joan seized the opportunity and said, "I think, Dad, we should at least invite Captain Camden to dinner." When Camden heard this, he was overjoyed and kept spinning a hat in his hands. Mitchell said, "Of course. Of course. You take care of it." Joan then said to Camden, "Okay, Captain? How about tomorrow night?" Camden shook the hand Joan offered him and replied, "Tomorrow night." Joan added, "Seven o'clock. No need to wear a tuxedo." Camden said goodbye to everyone and left.</p>
<p>The next evening, Camden ran to Mitchell's country villa to attend Joan's invitation. But when he got there, he felt extremely uncomfortable. He had originally wanted to use this opportunity to get closer to Joan by coming to dinner. But he was not the only one invited that day, there were also many other male guests, all of whom he did not know. He rarely saw Joan during the meal. Later, Mitchell insisted on introducing him to the public, calling her the hero of his newsroom. This made him even more embarrassed. Later, he saw Joan talking to Axel Brantley. They were talking in very low voices, their attitude was extremely intimate, and he also heard that they had already been engaged. This made him feel even more uninterested. He suddenly realized that there was no point in lingering in this place. This was not his place, a policeman mixing among a group of playboys. From the beginning, he should have declined. He thought he would first go to the garden for a walk, smoke a cigarette, and then say goodbye to the host and go back. The garden was particularly quiet, and Camden walked alone in it. He laughed at himself for how suddenly arresting Mitchell had caused such a small disturbance in his life. As he was thinking, he suddenly heard a rustling sound behind him, followed by some weight like moonlight being added to his shoulders, followed by a delicate voice saying, "What's wrong with you? Why are you always avoiding me at night?" (To be continued)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Architecture Weekly</p>
<h3>Progress of Domestic Building Materials in Recent Years (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xue Cixin</p>
<p>Since the Yellow Emperor built palaces and houses, initiating the beginnings of architecture, and by the Zhou Dynasty, the scale of architecture was roughly established, progressing through the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, with each era advancing in architecture. At that time, due to the limited uses of buildings, mostly confined to palaces, temples, and residences, the materials used were primarily bricks, stones, and timber. Unlike today's theaters, dance halls, apartments, and factories, which either prioritize practicality or aesthetics, it is insufficient to meet the needs without utilizing various materials. Therefore, the building materials of that era, sourced domestically, were sufficient and did not require foreign reliance. After the opening of maritime trade, European and American construction methods were introduced to our country. Thus, in terms of structure, there were steel frame projects and reinforced concrete buildings, and in terms of decoration, there were marble wall panels, mosaics, and patterned wooden floors. Other items such as door locks, hinges, glass, and paint relied solely on foreign goods. Even for something as small as a nail, domestic supply could not be fully depended upon. Lofty buildings and mansions in metropolitan areas are one thing, but even in remote rural areas, traces of foreign building materials are as rare as phoenix feathers. Observing this, it is clear that we should urgently catch up in improving and promoting domestic building materials. In recent years, the call for promoting domestic goods has spread throughout the country. Although in heavy industry, due to various economic and talent-related factors, there has not been significant progress, the advancement of practical domestic goods has shown a soaring trend. As the message spreads, existing domestic building materials are visibly improving, and those that did not exist are gradually being imitated or trial-produced. Although it is not possible to completely drive foreign goods out of the market at once, it is sufficient to replace them. If the people of the country can cherish this industry and promote the manufactured materials, then the future of domestic building materials will be limitless. Currently, there are already many types of domestic building materials, and we will discuss and analyze those that have shown improvement or achieved success in their development.</p>
<p>(1) Bricks and Tiles: In the past, brick and tile manufacturing mostly used earth kilns, using wooden molds to make blanks during agricultural off-seasons, which were then fired in earth kilns. Because of this, the sizes of bricks and tiles varied across regions, and the quality of materials also differed. Furthermore, workers were scattered among farmers, and kiln firing adhered rigidly to old methods, resulting in a daily decline in material quality. Industrial operators, due to the low profit margin, did not pay much attention to this. Until the prosperous era of exchanges in the early Republic, construction flourished, and this industry began to attract social attention. Initially, larger-scale brick and tile companies were organized, and new-style brick kilns were used. Some even used iron molds for making blanks. Therefore, in recent years, bricks and tiles have gradually improved, especially with the increasing thickness and length of brick blanks, reaching ten inches, which is commendable. The method and firing of tiles have also improved, and those who sell and use tiles have gradually learned to use the absorption rate of tiles as a standard for selection. This further shows that China's construction industry is gradually becoming more scientific.</p>
<p>In the past, earth kilns did not produce hollow bricks or fire bricks. In recent years, the height of buildings has increased daily, making it urgently necessary to reduce the weight of bricks. The use of hollow bricks has therefore increased daily. With the increasing number of factories, various boilers and chimneys all require high-temperature fire bricks, and the number of manufacturers of fire bricks has gradually increased, meeting the required industrial temperature. The greatest contribution in the brick and tile industry in recent years is the creation of facing bricks. The manufacture of facing bricks requires a high-temperature brick kiln to fire solid brick materials, as well as an aesthetically pleasing brick surface. Currently, domestic facing bricks can meet these conditions, and due to the contribution of this new domestic material, it has added much color to the field of architecture.</p>
<p>(2) Cement: China has had cement for a long time. In imitating Western goods among building materials, cement should be considered the first. Subsequently, cement plants were established in Shanghai and Longtan. At that time, many Chinese people were skeptical about the quality of newly produced cement, but ultimately, through testing and usage results, it was found to be no less than the best European and American cement. Once its reputation was established, sales increased daily. Cement transportation costs were very high, and foreign goods coming to China were not very numerous. At this point, it almost drove foreign imports out of the domestic market. However, Japanese products never completely disappeared. Recently, due to Japan's dumping policy, cement prices were low, and sales increased sharply. Quick-drying cement has been widely produced abroad, but China only started producing it in recent years. Cement occupies a very important position in construction, military affairs, transportation, and industry, and it is also one of the heavy industries. If the current performance can be maintained for a long time in manufacturing, and if others do not resort to excessive dumping policies, then the future of cement sales is limitless. Products made from cement, such as cement tiles, cement roofing tiles, and cinder blocks, have been increasing daily and monthly, which has also greatly benefited construction.</p>
<p>(3) Mosaics, Ceramic Tiles, and Glazed Tiles: Mosaics, ceramic tiles, and glazed tiles were previously not produced domestically. However, the demand for floors and wall coverings in bathrooms and other areas in new buildings is high. Therefore, the sales volume is not small. In recent years, the number of factories manufacturing them has gradually increased. Although there have been technical difficulties in terms of colors and sizes, they can be overcome. Currently, domestic products can compete with imported products. Even some merchants, to cater to social psychology, sell domestic goods as imported goods. In the future, as architecture becomes more prosperous, the uses of mosaics, ceramic tiles, and glazed tiles will increase. If more research can be done on material selection and color matching to make the products more beautiful, then the disappearance of imported products from the market is just around the corner.</p>
<p>(4) Paint: China originally produces lacquer and tung oil, and there are annual exports. Therefore, there should be no need to rely on others for paint. However, in recent years, buildings have become increasingly sophisticated, and the colors and gloss of paint required are beyond what domestic paint can provide. Even if it can be provided, its value is more expensive than imported paint. Therefore, foreign paints have entered the Chinese market because they are convenient to use and have a wide variety. As a result, there is no building where traces of foreign paint cannot be found. Fortunately, in recent years, some Chinese have recognized this and have established more and more paint factories. Although some of the raw materials cannot completely eliminate foreign imports, they are still manufactured by the Chinese. The quality of the materials is also improving daily, no less inferior to imported products. The variety has also increased, and all kinds of paints used for steel structures, bridges, ship hulls, doors, windows, floors, etc., can be manufactured to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<h3>Outline of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital Hygiene Laboratory Groundbreaking Ceremony on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Dong Dayou</p>
<p>The layout of each floor can be generally described as follows: The basement is located below the ground floor in the central part and is where boilers, electric meters, and machinery are installed. The first floor (ground floor) has a lobby in the center. The east wing contains offices, an X-ray department, and a special consulting department. The west wing contains the outpatient department. The information desk is located in the center of the lobby, surrounded by reception rooms and elevator shafts (two in total). Rooms for selling medicine, examinations, and first aid are also nearby. The second floor contains the surgical hospital and the operating department. The surgical hospital is divided into male and female sections. The male ward is in the east wing, with A-grade special, B-grade special, and general wards. The female ward and operating department are in the west wing. Each general ward can accommodate five to ten beds. There are two operating rooms, both facing north, with walls tiled with green-gray ceramic tiles and floors paved with polished stone of the same color. All of this has been carefully considered and decided after consulting with doctors. To the north of the central passageway, near the elevators, are classrooms and small testing rooms. To the south is a patient lounge with a large balcony. Various auxiliary rooms include a small kitchen, clothing storage room, nurses' station, bathrooms, and toilets. The above two points also apply to the third and fourth floors. The third floor has the pediatrics hospital in the east wing and the obstetrics department in the west wing. The pediatrics hospital has intensive care wards and general wards with glass partitions. The delivery rooms and waiting rooms of the obstetrics department are decorated similarly to the operating rooms on the first floor, and there are also nursery rooms and premature infant rooms. The layout of the fourth floor is similar to that of the first floor, but it is a male and female internal medicine hospital, so special wards replace the operating rooms on the first floor. The fifth floor only occupies the central part of the entire building and contains the kitchen, dining hall, food preparation room, and cold storage room. There is an elevator that goes directly to the basement to transport coal and other materials, and there are two food elevators to transport meals to the small kitchens on each floor.</p>
<p>Although the design of this building strives for economy, its contents are sufficient for current uses. It can accommodate a total of 150 beds in all departments, which can be increased to 200 if necessary.</p>
<p>The auxiliary buildings included in the initial project consist of a two-story building, which is one of the auxiliary buildings listed in the overall plan, located next to Fu Nan Zuo Road (referred to as "labor room" in the overall site plan). The ground floor of the building contains the funeral room, laundry room, and workshop, while the upper floor contains bedrooms.</p>
<p>3. Hygiene Laboratory</p>
<p>(Overall) Plan: The Hygiene Laboratory building faces Fu Dong Wai Road to the front and Hua Yuan Road to the west. Four auxiliary buildings are to be built on the east side, including the workers' room, animal breeding room, and vaccine manufacturing room, with the remaining land used for gardens (see the overall site plan).</p>
<p>(B) Initial Project: The current construction consists of the Hygiene Laboratory building and three auxiliary bungalows, namely the workers' room, animal breeding room, and vaccine manufacturing room, as well as a public toilet.</p>
<p>The Hygiene Laboratory building, in addition to a basement room for the boiler room, has four floors in the central part and three floors in the two wings, with a total length of approximately 41 meters and a depth of approximately 15 meters. The total floor area is approximately 1,860 square meters, and the total volume is 6,230 cubic meters. Its appearance and structure are generally the same as those of the Municipal Hospital building. The layout of each floor is as follows (see the floor plans):</p>
<p>The first floor (ground floor) has a lobby in the center, with passageways leading to both wings and staircases leading to the upper floors. The lobby is surrounded by an information room, waiting room, changing room, and refrigerator room. The left wing contains the material collection room, steam and dry sterilization room, washing room, and culture medium manufacturing room. The right wing contains the reception room, library, office, and director's office.</p>
<p>The second floor has male and female toilets on both sides of the central staircase, with a packaging room opposite them. The left wing contains the refrigerator sedimentation room, bacteria testing rooms (two in total), dissection room, and serum room. The right wing contains the vaccine manufacturing room, vaccine dilution room, vaccine testing room, vaccine grinding and dispensing room, and rabies vaccine room. The third floor has the medicine room, darkroom, and servants' room in the center. The left wing contains two exhibition rooms and two pathology rooms, as well as a large lecture hall. The right wing contains the balance room, water testing room, medicine room, nitrogen analysis room, and chemical rooms (two in total).</p>
<p>The fourth floor is located in the central part, rising above the two wings, with three storage rooms of various sizes.</p>
<p>The building is equipped with gas, compressed air, vacuum machines, both AC and DC electricity, high-voltage current, high-pressure steam, and electric refrigerators for application.</p>
<p>4. Remaining Remarks</p>
<p>The Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Laboratory projects were designed by the Architectural Office of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee in conjunction with the Bureau of Health. The budget for the first phase of the project is 400,000 yuan. The construction project was tendered by the Bureau of Public Works in November 1934. After review, Lu Genji Construction Company won the bid with a total bid price of 278,100 yuan and started construction in December, with the groundbreaking ceremony held on New Year's Day 1935.

<h3>Starting New Year's Day, Fir Wood Must Be Used for Issuing Building Permits for Public and Private Buildings</h3>
<p>In response to the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works formally announced yesterday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to ensure that domestic fir wood is used for public and private building timber before business licenses can be issued, and to implement this starting from January 1st, specially posted a public notice yesterday to inform the public. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requested that regulations be made to ensure that domestic fir wood must be used in all public and private buildings before business licenses can be issued. The Timber Bureau previously received instructions from the Municipal Government to review the matter and, after considering the building conditions in the city, proposed two standards for the minimum amount of domestic fir wood to be used: (1) The columns of single-story buildings must all be made of domestic fir wood; (2) The roof purlins of single-story or multi-story buildings with spans not exceeding 3.5 meters must all be made of domestic fir wood, but the diameter of the small end must not be less than 12 centimeters. These standards have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and will be implemented starting from January 1st, 1935. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge.</p>
