<h3 id="c27">如何促進我國蠶絲事業 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>華絲改良會對於蠶絲事業之促進。對內主「改良蠶種。」「限制各絲廠商收繭辦法。」「規定收繭價格。」「規定繭商借貸欵項。」若能實行。於絲業前途。助益當匪淺尠。同時劃一全國絲廠機器。改良生絲。使出品趨於整齊。對外注意出口生絲之市塲。使銷路暢旺。亦今日絲業復興之要著。其實行亦不可稍緩者也。</p>
<p>夫我國國民經濟。向以農村經濟爲主。在前我國農村所以尚稱餘裕者。農民除耕作收穫以外。其副業亦有利可圖也。江浙四川比較富庶之區。都爲農民副業發達之地。而農民副業之中。育蠶一項。對於農民收入之補助頗大。民國廿三年以前。吾國之出口貿易。以生絲列爲第一。故假使絲業一蹶不振。不獨農民受害。都市亦將直接間接蒙受其影響。今華絲改良會對蠶繭之改良。注意於指導改良蠶種一項。此於農村復興。自必極有裨益。惟補充改良絲廠機器。僅令撥欵十三萬五千二百四十元。以之分配於全國各廠。恐尚虞不足耳。</p>
<p>抑現在吾國絲廠。大都陷于困境。究其原因。實由於出品銷路之呆滯。與絲價之慘跌。其所以致此者。各絲廠家對於生絲銷路之向少注意。亦其一因也。故其補救之方。第一。自在調查市塲情勢。確知需要生絲之國家如美國等之生絲市塲之實况何如。進而竭力發揮華絲固有之特長。而力除其所短。使出品合乎市塲上之需要。即日本絲廠出品。與其在美國市塲之地位。亦須詳爲考查。以供參考。第二。須使各廠切實合作。對出品之質量。悉依市塲之需要而定其標準。借政府統制之力量。統一商人經營之歩驟。則絲業前途。或者轉機之望。</p>
<p>此外。生絲市塲之將來。亦須注意。蓋自人造絲興起以後。生絲即大受打擊。若不預籌對策。絲業對途。仍難樂觀。而國內市塲。實亦大有調查研究之必要。緣國人服用。無論男女。向來均崇尚絲織物。但吾國之絲織品漸失其堅實之長。而趨時之速又落人後。國人上等之衣服原料。遂爲外貨所侵。今後若能積極改良。則國內之消費者自不致傾心於舶來品。而蠶絲業在國內市塲之基礎。自可日趨鞏固矣。</p>

<p>要求談判展期</p>
<p>［柏林］英外相西門原定星期四乘飛機來柏林、而於三月十日返倫敦、今則展緩其行期、因德元首希特勒今日請暫緩來德也、據官塲消息、希特勒在往游薩爾時感受風寒、稍覺不適、</p>
<p>西門與希特勒及德政府其他人員之談話、須展緩幾天、未經示明、政界對於展緩一節、不欲發批評之言論、僅謂元首現微有寒疾耳、希特勒感冒及西門展緩來德之消息方經公佈、同時柏林各晚報皆載有社論、評詆英國關於國防之白皮書、稱爲不友好之文件、有名國社黨機關報安格里夫報謂當西門來德從事談判之前一夕、英國竟發表此種文件、其用意顯在恫嚇德國耳、此爲一種陳舊之外交之手腕、行之未能有效者也、哥尼斯堡日報稱此白皮書爲一種令人痛苦之驚人事、德國全部皆具此感云、德國各報以大字標題詳紀希特勒之體况、自國社黨秉政以來、此猶爲第一次、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］今晨政府發表英國國防宣言書、其中陸軍預算、較上屆增加四百萬鎊左右、員額則增加二千數百名、此事適在西門外相赴德之前公佈、不啻一種警告、政界人士以爲德國對於此項警告、必能加以領會、而英國從事國際和解事業、孜孜不懈、並未因德國重整軍備不受監察而稍稍退縮、此層亦當爲德國所了解也、此外英國所採措置、係屬防衛性質、但對於國際集合安全制度之主張、則並未放棄、而仍竭力求其勝利、此種心理、業由宣言書表而出之、不容稍存疑義、又宣言書不僅在國際方面含重大意義、即在國內亦將喧騰一時、蓋工黨反對派對於陸軍經費增加一事、必予激烈攻擊、政府仍將反對派抨擊之辭預加駁斥、同時爲內閣所採政策、竭力辯解、以爲先發制人之計也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德國政府一方面宣布希特勒元首抱恙、並請英國外相西門展期來德、一方面復發表公報加以解釋、謂希特勒元首現患感冒、在室內静養、不可以風云、截至目前爲止、外間迄未聞知希特勒元首感冒之説、按之「國社黨通信」所登消息、亦謂希特勒元首昨日尚親赴汽車展覽會作最後一次之參觀、可見感冒之説、係屬突如其來、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］官塲人士證實本月七日西門外相往柏林時、將與掌璽大臣艾登偕行、又謂柏林談話純爲探訪性質、並無訂立恊定或預先制定妥恊基礎之説云、今晨內閣舉行小組會議、對於英國派閣員前往莫斯科一事、業在原則上表示贊成、惟正式决定大約將俟下星期初西門艾登由柏林返國後、始能公布、至於所謂閣員究指西門抑或艾登、則閣議尚未决定、大抵以艾登方面居多、按英國政府深願聯絡蘇聯、與之樹立友善關係、務期互相信任、與法俄兩國交誼相等、此於英國閣員將往莫斯科一事可以明見矣（四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國閣員不日將往莫斯科聘問蘇聯、保守黨下議員台維森頃在下院向政府提出問題、謂閣員赴俄之前、政府是否擬與蘇聯舉行政治談判、俾將兩國商務懸案予以解决、西門外相答稱、「此種談判、政府並未加以擬議」云云、按英俄兩國前曾訂立臨時商約、保守黨議員認爲不充分、因此台維森氏提出上項問題、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］英國政府本日送交各報發表之宣言書、爲關於英本國及英帝國國防政策之一重要文件、該宣言書首述英國國防政策之動機、共分三項、</p>
<p>（一）英國曾迭次盡力於和平事業、如擁護國際聯合會也·非戰公約也·華盛頓條約也·羅加諾條約也·二月三日英法倫敦恊定也、凡此種種、英國靡不力加贊助、並參預其間、然如以爲僅恃各種公約、足以保障和平、則目前尚不免過早、蓋目前國際和平制度、用以保障各國避免侵略、效力尚有未足也、（二）目前各國競爭增加軍備、尤以德國爲然、德國之重整軍備、倘照現在情形繼續進行、則德國之各鄰邦、勢必更難安枕、而和平有遭威脅之慮、（三）英國國防組織及帝國交通道路之保護、尚未充分堅固、戰時保護英帝國海上交通、使本國給養不至缺乏、並保護英國人民不至遭天空襲擊、在目前均嫌未足、</p>
<p>根據上述三種理由、英國政府認爲英本國及英帝國國防、有設法增强之必要、宣言中縷述國防需要之範圍、及增加國防一般程序、計分爲海陸空三項、摘述如下</p>
<p>（一）海軍方面</p>
<p>主力艦始終佔英國海軍軍略之一主要地位、英國現有主力艦、均甚老舊、應於極短時期內建造新艦、加以替換、英帝國各海軍根據地必須加以發展、並增加其防衛、</p>
<p>（二）陸軍方面</p>
<p>主張增撥經費、使陸軍防空設備大加擴張、陸軍一切設備、均應大加革新、以求其現代化、</p>
<p>（三）空軍方面</p>
<p>航空技術之進歩、足使英國海岸受空軍襲擊之威脅、故就空防觀點而論、在英倫海峽以外之若干領土、其土地完整對於英國安全關係重要、今尤甚於昔日、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］駐美中國公使施肇基博士、今日與國務院人員會談、所談者大約係國際對華借欵之可能性、及美政府之白銀政策、此間人士對於此會、極爲注重、但所談內容、迄未有所發表、本日副國務總理費列浦曾告報界、謂施公使近關於美政府購銀程序、常與國務院接觸、但近今並無發展云、衆信解除中國財政困難之辦法、連借欵可能性在內、現正在同情的考量中、費氏今日並與日大使齋藤作短談、聲明美國如與他國作關係中國之外交談判、則願以各種進展詳告日本云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今晨自可靠方面得悉、美國政府準備悉心考慮英國建議之國際會商援助中國、觀察者現信政府大概可贊成任何不致引起國際傾軋、而能阻制日本在此時出借巨欵藉此鞏固在華地位之任何計畫、英國之建議、主張法·日·美·英四國合作、援助中國、據接近國務院者稱、政府凖備擁護英國之計畫、惟若干人則覺該計畫建議、由英美兩國聯合日本、向中國出債資金而排除法國云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日中國駐美公使施肇基、曾與國務院當局會晤、該項消息發表之後、已引起種種懸測、謂英國建議之國際助華計劃、或將包括關於國際白銀價格及供給之若干聯合歩驟云、惟官塲方面不願證實此種懸測、並稱、目前尚無新發展、至英國之對華態度、實與美國政策互相符合、即對華有關之國家聯合運動、而不以單獨競爭之方法以謀取得特殊利益也、官塲方面拒絶討論英國建議、惟表示對於英國首先提出此議、願爲歡迎、因此舉係重新確定英國之態度、仍在保持遠東安定、此間若干觀察者信聯合行動、或可仍以往日英法日美四國銀團出之、高級方面以爲英國之利益加以日美兩國之利益、或可造成一種共同利益之政策、較之已往範圍重大、據悉官塲對於英美聯合破壞日本之説、完全否認、蓋英國之助華建議、曾向各方廣徵意見、且曾邀請日本參加、故此間以爲實係一種範圍廣大之計劃、而爲美國素所同意者云、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］據聞國務副卿費利浦、頃向日本大使齋藤提出保證、謂美國若因中國問題而與他國進行談話、必當以詳細情形通知日本、按英國政府日昨曾向美日法三國政府提議、共同考慮在財政上援助中國之可能、兹國務副卿向日本大使所作保證、實與英國政府就商美日法三國之舉、具有同一見解、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］羅總統今日以特别咨文送交國會、主張以政府直接的津貼維持充分商船、而取消包運外洋郵件之現有制度、羅總統稱、美國目前付給包運郵件之經費三千萬元、其實以尋常海船運費計之、其實價僅爲三百萬元、故二千七百萬元之差額、簡直乃一種津貼、羅總統臚舉三大理由、請國會接受其提議、（一）祥平時他國所給與之航業津貼、及其他限制或回扣之辦法等、可用以摧毁美國航商、即爲維持公允競爭一端起見、美國商船亦須有充量的噸數、俾適當經營美國對外貿易、（二）遇有他國戰爭而不牽涉美國之時、美國商業如自己無充分商船、則將大受影響、因未能覓取船隻以經營中立而和平的對外貿易也、（三）遇有牽涉美國之戰爭時、美國商船尤屬需要、不僅用爲海軍補助艦、且須用以維持對他國之必要的商業、羅總統又稱、美國商船向來甚關重要、但近來其價值與重要皆已衰落、但今日已屆整頓時期、各國今皆增築新式商船、美國人民欲美政府參加此種競爭、並欲美國利用自己船隻、故政府責任所在、須查明美國之商船是否與國民希望及國家需要相適應、從前變相的津貼、如包運郵件及造船借欵等、皆已行之失敗、故主張直接津貼、而以美國與也國造船及營業代價之差額及許多外國津貼航營之金額爲根據云、至於津貼數字、羅總統並未言明、欲使國會决定足以抵消上述差額之數、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>關署研究加税問題</p>
<p>連日米業市塲方面、對洋米加税消息、頗多議論、一説將於下月實行、一説須經行政院通過、令飭財政部、照立法院前次通過之洋米進口税之最高原則實施、大公社記者昨向此間財政部關務署駐滬辦事處探詢、據韋秘書談、此事關於全國民食、是否需要加徵洋米進口税、尚在精密研究中、外傳已定期實行、迄未接財部正式命令云云、但記者從其他方面所得消息、謂加徵洋米税、係各方之要求、最近期內當可實現、當局爲行政手續、恐事前發表、有所窒碍、故對實行開徵之期、不肯輕易宣布也、</p>

<p>組織委員會籌商進行計劃</p>
<p>中央社云、關於本市銀行行將組織之上海商品運銷信托社、業已具體化、此事對於內地與滬市資金流通上之關係至鉅、故內地行商、亦頗爲重視、兹誌各情如次、</p>
<p>資本百萬</p>
<p>參加上海商品運銷信托社之銀行、計有中國·交通·上海商業·江蘇·暨農民·等五銀行、資本一百萬元、由該五銀行平均分担、此事經各銀行籌商已久、最近已具體化、該社章程、業由各銀行商决、不久由各銀行繳齊欵項後、即可宣告成立、開始營業、</p>
<p>蘇省先辦</p>
<p>各銀行因鑒於內地與滬市資金、受市面不景氣影響、發生阻滯、故經多次磋商、乃决定組織該社、惟以中國地面遼闊、一時殊難普及、故先從江蘇省着手、蓋蘇省與滬市關係密切、且該省原稱富庶、營業上又極便利、現在蘇省府方面、表示願盡力恊助在營業上之便利、俟該省辦有成效、即將推行及於其他各省、</p>
<p>組委員會</p>
<p>所有參加上海商品運銷信托社之各銀行、各推委員一人、組織一委員會、籌商各項進行計劃、所有蘇省內地、均將分别設立辦事處、以便與內地行商接洽、內地行商、過去在資金上、均借助於錢莊、但邇年來錢莊營業已發生問題、故行商殊感經濟週轉上之不靈便、今該社成立後、完全以押匯押欵方式辦理、不獨銀行本身穩堅、在行商方面、亦稱便不少云、</p>

<p>招待各界來賓並即席募股</p>
<p>江西光大瓷廠、自經杜重遠君、與江西省府籌設進行、業經大體就緒、本埠發起人張公權·李石曾·杜月笙·張嘯林·錢新之·等、於三月四日午後四時、在福開森路世界社內、延請各界領袖、舉行茶話會、各界來賓、計到塲者、有吳市長·蔡財政局長·蔡元培·許世英·章士釗·趙晋卿·李大超、陳光甫·徐新六·王志莘·宋子良·陳立庭·唐壽民·虞洽卿·郭順·聶潞生·方液仙·項康元·潘序倫·及金融實業各界名人四十餘人、首由</p>
<p>李石曾起立致詞　略謂、瓷器是日用必須品、消費數目很大、是極值得舉辦的一種事業、現在有相當的專門人材杜重遠先生主辦、江西省府、對於此種生産事業、又極熱心促成、希望上海方面金融實業各界同志、特别贊助、踴躍投資、繼由</p>
<p>張公權發言　略謂、鄙人在九一八事變時候、正在瀋陽、當時瀋陽全市各機關人員、逃避一空、工商各界、全部停業、惟獨杜重遠君所辦的肇新瓷廠、雖然緊鄰在事變起點北大營的旁邊、在砲火蓛空之下、工廠裏仍然照常工作、鄙人到肇新瓷廠、參觀的時候、全廠工人的秩序和精神、仍然異常振奮、絲毫没有恐惶的態度、鄙人當時遍歷全廠參觀之後、覺得非常驚訝、對於杜重遠君之大無畏精神、和他平日對於職工的訓練、實深欽佩、當時、因爲瀋陽各銀行全部休業、肇新瓷廠、在金融上無法周轉、曾經轉囑瀋陽敝分行、對於該廠加以援助、在當時祇是出於一種感情作用、覺得這樣一個工廠、無論在某種環境下、都不應當坐令停閉、至於廠方能否維持下去、和將來能否償還欠欵、當時並未計及、以後瀋陽秩序逐漸恢復、肇新瓷廠、仍然繼續營業、據去年瀋陽敝分行報告、肇新廠的欠欵、已經陸續全部還淸、所以鄙人覺得杜重遠君在辦事上的忠實態度、是值得贊許、值得介紹的、現在關於創辦江西光大瓷廠的經過、請杜君報告、</p>
<p>杜重遠報告　兄弟在去年承孔部長介紹、到江西去、和態主席籌商創辦機械製瓷工廠的事情、因贛省府對於發展贛瓷、抱有最大决心、所以對於兄弟個人的意見、儘量採納、磋商結果、第一件、是由江西省政府撥欵二十萬元、作爲提倡股本、至於組織方面、完全按照商辦辦法、第二件、是由省政府保障、商股常年六釐股息三年、即在開辦後三年內瓷廠無盈利可以分劈時、山省政府担負發給商股六釐股息、以上兩項辦法、已經江西省政府會議通過、股欵廿萬元、在去歳十一月間、山省府撥下、兄弟當於本年一月間、到平津方面、向東北同鄉墓集股欵、北平方面、由沈　百茀·宋壽山·李香齋·諸君發起、天津方面、由馬占山將軍·魯際青廳長·許化周局長等發起、計留平津一星期左右、共募股欵二十餘萬元、當時、交存銀行之現欵爲十二萬五千元、至上海方面、在鄙人去歳赴贛之前、已與史量才先生在杭面洽、史君對於鄙人所營事業、向極關切、當時曾允盡力恊助、並示以負担滬方股欵全責、迨鄙人到贛未久、史先生突於由杭返滬之際遇難、無任痛悼、以致滬方股欵、遽遭頓挫、幸承公權·月笙·諸先生熱誠愛助、使募股工作、得以仍舊進行、計現在各方股欵、已認到七十萬元左右、距原訂股欵、尚缺三十萬元、至外省股欵、因按照鄙人計劃、擬將來在長沙濟南各設分廠一處、所以已請魯省韓向方主席、和湘省何芸樵主席、特别帮忙、又西京方面、已請邵仲輝主席、和楊虎城主任、代爲招募、鄙人於創設瓷廠、雖不敢自負有完全把握、但自信外人瓷廠、係用機械製造、實行科學管理、我們的瓷廠、也用同一方式經營、至於銷路方面、我們的瓷廠、在大量製造日用必需品、如交通機關所用之瓷製電料、及一般人所用之餐盤磁磚等等、預想一定供不應求、並　且外瓷人口、有百分之四十關税、本廠瓷器、財政部方面、允許免税行銷各省、在政府人民通力合作之下、實有制勝外瓷可能、瓷廠前途、絶對樂觀、本日、承各界來賓、撥冗蒞臨、並蒙各位主人、在百忙中、發起宴會、謹將光大瓷廠籌備緣起及募股經過、約略報告、並謹致謝意、</p>
<p>錢新之致詞　杜重遠君、在民國二十年春季、曾爲遼寗肇新瓷廠增招新股事、在上海募股數萬元、是年秋間、適逢九一八事變、滬方各股東、以爲此項股本、一定要全部損失、以後杜重遠君鑒於肇新瓷廠、在外力壓廹下、已失發展希望、在事變後、未久即將滬方可入股欵、全部由遼寗肇新瓷廠提出、歸　上海各認股人、鄙人於杜君此種信義行爲、實深敬佩、所以願在本次茶話會中、補充一點個人意見、</p>
<p>吳市長演詢　敝人曾經到過遼寗、參觀過杜重遠君所辦的肇新瓷廠、他廠子裏的出品、不是我們上海人所常見的、完全是極普通的日常用品、而且多數是銷到各農村去、所以鄙人覺得、以前江西瓷器之未能發展、實在是偏重於美術方面、其製出成品、是供極少數人買作古董的、所以每一件精瓷、它的代價極貴、而無禆實用、並且一件精緻裝飾品、是永遠什襲珍藏、不易損壞、以致出品銷路極狹、而一切電料用磁具、和一般日用品、反完全用外國瓷器、遂使漏巵日鉅、誠可痛心、杜重遠君之所以成功、第一個原因、就是在取得最大出路的銷塲、而放棄了供人賞鑑美術品的製造、第二個原因、杜重遠君　所以成功、是在本其所學、誠誠懇懇、切切實實的去作、不好高鶩遠、不作暫時不易辦到的理想工作、專採取容易實現容易成功的事去辦、我想以杜先生的過去經騐、來發展江西瓷業、在人的方面、是最爲適合、將來瓷廠開工、所有政府各機關所用磁製電料、可以在瓷廠訂製、社會上必需品、可由瓷廠源源供給、銷路方面、可供爲發展的機會太多了、營業上一定可操勝算、我很希望各界的同志、有意投資的人、要共同注意、要共起恊助、</p>
<p>許駿人演説　鄙人有友人陳大章君、前在景德鎭設立瓷業公司一處、據鄙友的經騐、如果用五千元買機械一座、每日可出瓷器六千件、如用十二個工人、用手工製造、每日不過出三百件、中國的手工業、怎能抵往外瓷呢、將來如江西方面機械瓷廠成立、其出量之豐、對於瓷器生産上、一定造成驚人的數字、所以鄙人渴望其早日成功云云、末由</p>
<p>李石曾提議　即席請各贊助人書明代募股欵數目、並請於三個月內、負責繳股、計當塲募到股欵十餘萬元、其餘不足之股欵二十萬元、由本日發起茶會各主人、平均擔負、賓主酬酢、直至下午七時始盡歡而散、</p>

<p>民國十九年日本生絲以外重要輸出商品對華輸出百分比。（單位百萬元日幣）</p>
<p>若把生絲製品除外，則日本重要輸出品之銷售於中國市塲的，占百分之五十一；而日本的糖銷售於中國的額　，占其總輸出百分之九十五，麵粉之銷售於中國的，占其總輸出百分之八十六；紙類之銷售於中國的，占其總輸出百分之八十四；海産之銷售於中國的，占其總輸出百分之七十二；煤之銷售於中國的，占其總輸出百分之七十五；其他如棉布銷售於中國的，也占其總輸出百分之四十二。由此可知日本的輸出貿易，是如何仰賴中國市塲而生存了。</p>
<p>現在我們再進一歩研究在中日不平等的國際地位現狀之下，中日經濟提携後，日本能供給中國什麽商品呢？這些商品是否爲中國所必需呢？一國的國産工業之振興，必先從輕工業開始。我國年來輕工業品的躍進，即證明國産工業。有着光明的前途，我們看着去年各商品輸出的增减，便可明白中國國産工業發展之趨勢。</p>

<p>萬里橋，這個名稱好像不時聽到，但是，在北方，也娮是一個很熟悉的名詞了，這座橋，在河南商城縣，是用石塊所建築成的，共長十八里，自然，稱之謂萬里橋是形容它的長，况且中國人是最喜誇大的。</p>
<p>橋雖然有十八里之長，可是那條河，却不見得闊，所以這座橋有三分之二是在旱地，好像一座小山，橋面很闊，在這邊跨上石級慢慢上去，橋也一點點隆高起來，走到橋的頂端，有四個小茶亭，供行人息脚，而那些趕路的人，到了頂點，便汗流氣喘，很是疲乏，由此可見這座橋的長，確足命令我們驚嘆的了，通常，這個地方没有可以代歩的東西，只有羊角小車，不過，坐這種小車是很危險的。</p>
<p>根據我淺薄的見聞，覺得中國的橋，没有比這座萬里橋更偉大的了，可惜我不知道這座橋是在那一個朝代建築的。</p>
<h3 id="c158">元寳籃 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 胡希旦</p>
<p>元寳的名詞，看來似乎很好聽，但它的形態却很奇特；撓起了二端，斜披了身子，人們老不把它算是如何高貴的東西，輕視它，所以它的用處，也祗是主婦們上菜塲時的附屬品。但他却不甘願做低三下四的，大魚大肉，不向元寳籃裏放，它祇是裝聚些豆腐；小白魚等很輕的東西。主婦們有剩不了的銀洋銅元，也安放在裏面，這些都能顯出它比較的嬌養，雖然，或許它的體質的確是柔弱些。但我們該知道，它在數百年前，還不幹這營生哩！所謂行行出狀元；它的祖先常伴着狀元郎做讀書人趕考者的第二生命。且聽我道來：</p>
<p>宋時朝廷引用仕人進階，舉行考試的風氣很盛，那時鄉試完畢，很有些趕道進京，參加殿試的。他們的行李，傢具，除了舖蓋寳劍，考籃外，大都帶一隻元寳吉祥的元寳籃；據説，那時的式樣，還有些尖鋭形，這大概是取其歩歩高昇的好口彩吧！元寳籃今昔的地位，既不能同日而語，也難怪它不免要興今昔之感了！也有人説；現在的元寳籃是由從前的脱胎換骨而來；是否尚須待證。</p>
<h3 id="c159">馬寳 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 周子欣</p>
<p>馬寳這個名稱，對我是尚屬初次的聽聞，很生疎，驀生；一般的人，也許對它是有着和我同樣的感受吧！看了三友實業社馬寳的仿單，我纔破題兒認識，是治療病症的名貴的藥品。</p>
<p>據説，馬寳是産在遼遠的邊塞，産馬的區域。那馬在曠郊野外，偶或食了天生異草，那天天的食料，就不再循理的消化，停積沉滯在胃部；馬的本身，又惠受着山川的靈氣，和日月的精華，滯積的食料，經了這兩重的感惠；久後，就胎結成似石非石似骨非骨的堅質。這堅硬的質物，作祟似的，阻止了馬的食糧，使馬鎭天的不知飢，鎭天的不知飽，在這時期，絲絲的馬毛，爲了食糧的斷絶，就好像着了濕的皮毛，逐漸的稀少，剝落，最後免不了連那性命都斷送了。</p>
<p>分别馬寳的優和劣，大都在那色澤和分量。據説色彩潔白，分量沉重，沙質稀少，心實的纔是屬於佳品，不過這一層。非是個中人是不易辨識的。馬寳，含有主治吐血，痰迷，等的偉效，它值價它的昻貴，也許是這個原由吧！</p>
<p>可憐的畜生—馬—食了天生的異草，感受了山川的靈氣，冒的精華，反正是斷送着性命，我們一般的人們，却把斷送它的東西（馬寳）視作珍貴藥品，這一層，使我始終的懷疑着，老是不能了解！</p>

<p>— （飛飛）</p>
<p>我希望我能够化片白雲，終日逍遥自在地飄浮在廣無邊際的太空之中，來往自如，絲毫不受拘束，隨我遊盡天之涯，地之角也没人來干涉我；莫説人們不敢來干涉我，就是月亮與太陽也不可以干涉我。</p>
<p>快樂的時候，跟着狂潮馳騁追逐，或相牽着，跳着，舞着。不然就和嬌媚的春花調調笑；或是和多愁的秋月談談心。再不然，就和害羞的星星們在寂静的夜空裏耍一回。</p>
<p>疲倦了，便隨意地停息在高山的尖頂上，俯視着，静聽着海洋中洶湧的怒潮。</p>
<p>不高興的時候；立刻面孔一板，心頭一冷，凝結成滂沱的淚雨，洗净世人醜惡的心！</p>
<p>唉！白雲，白雲，我到底什麽時才能化片逍遥自在的白雲呢？（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="c161">滬高航綫的回溯 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>上海市輪渡的上海碼頭最近由南京路外灘（俗稱銅人碼頭）移到北京路外灘，新建有雙層碼頭，開闢了中國建築史的新紀錄，值得大家注意。這市輪渡的主要航線是上海到高橋—一個浦東的鄉鎭，擴展到吳淞還没一二年呢。</p>
<p>高橋，雖然鎭的直徑最長處不滿三里，因是當代名流杜月笙氏的家鄉，常有冠蓋往來，又出有不少握着建築界權威的人物，（浦東多産水木工匠工頭素來有名）也能推進地方上各種新設施，又好在地沿黄浦，適宜做繁擠的上海住宅區的尾閭，外加近年來設有海濱浴塲在離鎭三四里的海邊，可動上海西僑和一班新人物的生活上的真趣，—人傑地靈兼備，那航路的交通自然長足進展，還在方興未艾咧！</p>
<p>這滬高航線得達今天的成績，有過去簡陋的歷史可紀，證明它進程的迅捷，襯映出上海繁榮的巨浪波及近上海地帶，是適應着需要和地利。</p>
<p>二十五年前，高橋的居民到上海，必須乘坐航船，費了四五點鐘繼續的時間，經過那五十餘里波摇浪擺的江程，像最近二年前從高橋直航吳淞須乘長渡的情形一樣。所以，若非必不得已，高橋人决没有到上海一次的。</p>
<p>其後，離高橋十二里左右的東溝地方，有該地塘工局。董事朱福田氏創行小火輪船，通駛東溝到上海的航綫。高橋人就多數不惜小車的乘資，取道東溝搭乘輪船，貪圖它的穩快便利了。</p>
<p>再後一二年，（距今廿年左右）高橋的鄉紳孫氏獨資開辦同興小輪船，建築輪埠在離鎭不足三里的天燈頭地方，高橋界河港口稍進的所生；在上海，仍用歷來高橋船停洎，最近纔更換掉的銅人碼頭。小輪每天開行六七班，總有一班拖帶着航船，裝運笨重的貨物。航船是給解歇在南市十六舖的浦江邊，以便搭客就近辦貨裝儎。高橋有直達上海的輪渡從此開始；高橋居民稱便。單航的老式航船自然受了淘汰。</p>
<p>高橋劃歸上海市後，市輪渡開始駛行，也彎泊東溝。市輪渡的高橋埠建在浦江邊岸—在天燈頭的最遠地點，輪船不用進港，又便利些。它公平地聽憑老輪船—現名和記—照常行駛，保有它舊有的碼頭，直到現在。（未完）</p>

<p>第十回　唐突女郎前露財選色覬覦墻隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>朱胡氏道：我聽見了，我聽見張老爺説過好幾遍了。你呌我心裏活動一下，我怎樣活動一下呢？張介夫不由噗嗤一笑，心想本來是自己太老實了。對於這樣天昏地的黑女人，和他只管打着啞謎，他如何能懂？便昻頭想了一想笑道：錢這樣東西，是很艱難得的，你總應當知道。胡氏道：是呀！我也是這樣説呀。怎麽我心裏一活動，這錢就可以歸我呢？張介夫道：這倒不是假話。這位賈老爺，他所以要討人，就爲的是一個人太孤單了等着要個人陪他，假如……他自己説到這裏，也覺難於向下説，輕輕的咳嗽了兩聲。可是他等着要錢用，也不下於朱胡氏，他心裏另有他一番計畫，而這番計畫，是必須要賈多才帮助的，那麽，怎好不和他辦成這件事？於是自己鼓動了自己的勇氣，向月英看過之後，再向胡氏道：既然你已經是願意把姑娘給這位賈老爺的了。胡氏點着頭道：這樣有錢的人，我還有啥不願意呀？張介夫道：這就好辦了。你們兩方，一個是願意給，一個是願意要，那末，你這姑娘，遲早是他家的人了，何不就……説着，他頓上一頓，又笑了。朱胡氏翻着兩眼看他，依然不知他命意所在，可是月英姑娘有些明白了，這决不是怎樣好聽的話，就皺了眉向介夫道：張老爺，我們都是可憐的人，什麽也不懂。你呌我們做的事，我們做得出來，那决不敢説第二個字，一定是做。我們做不出來，就請張老爺包涵一點，我們那裏還敢説着什麽呀。（一四九）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他們本來不是和我們一起搭在這列黄色火車上的，他們和兵士們一起裝在後面第二列車上。太后最初是對於他們很有興緻的，但聽過幾次，已説厭了；這時候已根本記不得後面的兵車上，還有他們這一班人了。所以當李蓮英來向伊奏明這件事的時候，伊祇極含糊的點了點頭，什麽話都不曾説。</p>
<p>過了那一長串俯伏着的官員之後，月台也就完了，—他們足足跪滿了月台的全部。—其時天津還不甚熱鬧，離車站稍遠，兩旁所見的便全是那些土饅頭式的墳墓，和茫無邊際的田野了。太后也不高興再靠着窗閒眺，依舊回到了伊的御座上來。這時候車行的速度又漸漸增加了；我從這些車輛的震動的程度上推測，大概現在尤比未到天津以前行得快了。我們其實都巴不得如此，連太后也絶不以車輛震動的加劇而表示不滿；倒像是後面真有甚麽可怕的魔鬼在追襲我們，使我們來不及的想逃避。當日來的時候所見的沿途的景物，似乎是没有一處使我們看了不歡喜的；如今回來了，景物還是和十幾天前一樣，而我們見了，竟反覺有些恐懼起來。</p>
<p>我們這列御用列車不久又到了豐台，這裏雖然也有許多的官員在跪接聖駕，但太后那裏會注意他們，李蓮英當然更不會再來禀告，太后；車子也萬無再遲緩下來之理，只一瞥便越過了，但是一過了豐台，北京便近了，列車的速度，終于逐漸的减低，讓它慢慢地淌向永定門去。那裏就是太后出京時上車的所在。（二六○）</p>

<h3 id="c198">藝術與生活 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 任</p>
<p>不久以前，曾經有過一會「作家與生活」的討論。那意見可分做三派，一派主張作家必須作爲一個作家而參加生活；一派主張作家必須作爲一個普通的人而參加生活。另一派則以爲作家作品之優秀與否，與生活之充實無關，全憑作家本人想象之豐富與否。這三派實際上又可分二個不同的原則。一二兩派是承認作家必須充實生活的。第三派則否認作家必須充實生活；那意見是頗爲偉大的；不必加以論究。但一二兩派，哪一派正確，我們可引居友底話，先來作個參考。</p>
<p>居友在他「從社會的見地來看藝術」一書裏，曾有一章，論到「藝術中個人的及社會的生活之表現」，説：</p>
<p>「真正的藝術家，與其以藝術家的資格，寗以人類的一員，社會的博愛的人，來觀感事象。要不然，携帶此種職務的人（即自以爲是個藝術家的人）是在自己心中殺却了感情，把成爲真正的美底確實基礎之生命，從其作品中奪去了。「眼中除藝術之外便没有什麽的人，其缺陷點之一，往往祇觀感到其生活本身中，易爲藝術所表現者，及容易轉置於假構世界中者。而於其他却有捨棄不顧的傾向。這樣的人，常將藝術逐漸侵入於實生活範圍中。他底感動，常與此種實際目的相結合，與他自己之藝術的興味相結合。他已不是爲感而感，而是爲了利用，或轉用其感動而感了。這正與供職於商業者，其舉動言語已失却自動性質，祗知一味應酬，正復相同。…」（依據我自己底「劣譯本」，大江版）</p>
<p>居友是個主張藝術應該「表現生命底一切的力」的。所以他：「確信生命本身是重要的。」在他以爲在利用事物來表現以前，必須「先要感到所感的。」要不然「祗看到可得而捉捕的，可得而表現的；結果，是拘泥於事物底皮相。是把自然與美術館相混了。」這意見我以爲大體是可以同意的。當然，我們平凡人，没有那麽高超的玄想，跟居友來談生命哲學。但我總以爲無論誰藝術上有成就，還不如生活上有成就。藝術上底成就，在現在這個時期，是人生底最大的悲劇；而生活上能有所成就，却無論如何，是增加了歷史底推進的動力的。</p>
<p>我以爲在現在重要的事，不是作家與生活問題。而是我們青年如何充實有意義的生活，如何認真生活的問題。站在文學與藝術方面講，那麽也是先有真摯的生活，才有真摯的文學藝術。這一點我們要明白的。</p>
<h3 id="c199">網眼海濱 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>知道我對於海的渴慕，在决定了網眼海浴的日期以後，想盡了法子通知我的是陶，我的昔年的同學。於是早兩日我便從姑母家回到棉蘭來，集合了旅伴們，在一個非常明朗的日子裏，預備了野餐的食品，被那笨大的汽車載着出發了。</p>
<p>「我没有去過網眼」，在車上，我這樣地對陶説。</p>
<p>陶便不厭煩地告訴我那是怎麽一個地方。他還説網眼出名是在海浴。是的，偌大的蘇門答拉島，可玩的地方實在没有幾處。對於網眼的海，我就希望牠能給我滿足。</p>
<p>汽車出了市外，路就開始彎曲起來。兩旁是椰林或者種植着許多不同的菓樹的菓子園。我探出腦袋去，馬來村落也出現了，一些不穿上衣的女人在餵飼他們的牲畜。孩子們瞧見我們的車子馳至便大聲呌起來。再過去是逐漸荒凉了，衝過一座石橋，陶説，那邊不遠是一個小市鎭，問大家想不想停下來歇一下。但是大家都在急於要洗浴去，所以没有一個人主張停車的。這樣，汽車衝過了這小市鎭，直向目的地駛去。</p>
<p>從棉蘭到網眼約化兩個鐘頭便可以到了。然而，海浜卻距離網眼半個鐘頭的路程；於是，在網眼稍稍鬆了一口氣以後，我們又趕上了路。</p>
<p>「真遠呢！」有人那麽説着。</p>
<p>然而，正因爲路程太遠的緣故，到了目的地的時候心頭的欣喜便加倍地在每一個人的臉上表現出來。車停着我們一同跳下來，往海邊走去。陶的意思是先吃飽了再玩；兩個女同伴顯然也感到飢餓了，馬上表示她們的同意。而我和選，順却獨自行動了。換上游泳衣就往海水里跳。網眼的海是一望無際的浩盪，滾起白的浪花，有時衝到沙灘上來。把身子浸在鹽味的海水里，腦袋上面是赤道的正午的太陽；而這時候誰也忘記了炎熱而盡情地享受到海所給予的一切。吹着風，海邊的椰林呼嘯着。陶在呌我們吃飯了，便濕着身子走了上岸，在一個棕欄葉搭成的小亭子下面，用我們的野餐。</p>
<p>「聚在一塊兒不是容易的事啊！」順咬着鷄腿，一面説，「我們今天該好好地玩才對。」</p>
<p>是的，吃飽了，我在亭子里休憇着，而他們却又到海水里去了。這時是漲潮時節，汹湧的海水向着沙灘衝來，雄壯而且偉大。「忘了帶攝影機了！」我自語着。那里知道陶已經用他的照相機給女伴拍照了。</p>
<p>「給我也拍一張吧！」我走過去，站在海灘上，齊膝的海水，親切地吻着我的脚踝。背面是浩盪的海面。……</p>
<p>三年以後的現在，把這張網眼海濱所拍的照片從箱角翻出來，看着那褪色的樣子，就感到時日飛快地過去，而我也年紀大得多了。嘗盡了漂泊的苦味，人世的艱辛，在稍稍有點蒼老的心片上，回憶到那嘻戲的往日，不禁唏嘘起來。</p>

<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>一九一八年是安化新化兩縣的人們遭空前未有的大刦底年頭，從春天起一直到秋天，整整地過了八個月的恐怖生涯，在田事耕種着的農夫，都被北洋軍閥虜去當挑夫了，如果有逃跑的，立刻就是一槍：因挑重而走得慢點的，他們就用刺刀刺傷農夫們的腿子。晚上這些俘虜們都被鎖在一間黑房子裏，没有飯吃，也不許他們出外小便。有許多挖墻壁逃跑的，通通被抓來殺掉了，死屍身上的破衣，破褲都被丘八們剝去做包袱。</p>
<p>婦女們住在路邊的，很少有不被他們强姦的。八十歳的老婆婆，十一二歳的小姑娘，也不知被姦死了多少！稍爲富裕的人家搶出了東西後，還要殺人；貧苦的，連幾個紅藷都被搶光了。他們每到一處就槍聲拍拍，搶刦一空，城市搶完了，然後一隊隊的荷着槍到鄉間去。又是大搶，亂殺，抓人，放火……</p>
<p>最後是血洗藍田，殺得屍積如山，血流成河，房屋被燒得片瓦不留，到處只聽得哭哭啼啼，慘無天日……</p>
<p>這災禍的起源是這樣的：</p>
<p>北洋軍閥張敬堯和南方譚浩明是兩個絶不兩立的死對頭，第一次南北之役，北勝南敗，因此張的軍隊就經過長沙，直抵新化寳慶。駐紥在新化的是第五團，團長是張敬堯的乾兒子，名呌張繼忠。這一團的士兵，每個都是土匪似的姦淫虜掠，殺人放火無所不爲，所以大家稱他爲爛五團。</p>
<p>一天，有二十多個士兵從謝鐸山（我的故鄉）經過（這里位於新化安化之間，來往於這兩縣或由長沙來的，都要經過這裏，）在一家舖裏吃了飯，穿了草鞋，没有給錢，店主向他們要，他們不但不給錢，反而抽出刺刀來恐嚇店主，「哼！敢找老子要錢，當心你的狗命！」這樣駡着，他們就一溜烟跑掉了，店主當時氣的了不得，連忙集合了二十多人趕上前去，士兵就舉起槍來（幸而是没有子彈的槍）羣衆一齊大聲叫喊，沿途男女老幼通通跑了出來追趕北兵，有的用石子擲過去，有的用菜刀去砍，孩子們也都拿着小小的棍子亂抽亂呌，結果在淸風橋這地方有幾個北兵，活活地被羣衆打得血肉横飛，當時大衆快活得狂跳起來，拍着手大聲喊道：</p>
<p>「打得好，打得痛快，這些危害老百姓的土匪，我們要一個個的打死他們。」</p>
<p>第二天得到由團部發下的命令，知道昨天的事情糟了，不但要緝拿兇手，並且要焚燬謝鐸山整個的房屋。惹禍的店主呌謝承崑，是一個常與我家來往的忠厚而能幹的中年人，他得到了這個消息後，忙跑來請求我的父親設法排解。父親知道這事情太嚴重了，只得邀集許多父老一同到縣裏去交涉，同時領了兩百餘名男女老百姓進城去「喊寃」，説明昨天的事，不是百姓打兵，而是兵打百姓。</p>
<p>誰知一到了縣裏，父親和所有同去的人們，通通都被扣留了，這時全縣的羣衆，都鬨動起來，誰都説北洋軍閥太豈有此理了，如果他不釋放請願的羣衆，收回焚燬謝鐸山的成命，决定和他拚個死活。這時謝鐸山羣衆的勇敢，他們鐵一般堅固的團結精神，已經使得那位爛五團的團長發抖了，再加上新化全縣四五萬人的請願，更嚇得他魂不附體。第二天淸早就釋放了所有被捕的羣衆，並委父親爲「高等顧問」（自然　名稱根本就是不通的！）父親明知道這太無聊了，自己是淸高的隱士，如今把名字列在軍閥的隊伍裏，的確受侮辱了，然而爲了保護一鄉羣衆的生命，只好忍辱含垢地領了委任狀歸來。</p>
<p>過了一　　　　　　生活，農人們都感謝父親，其實這是他們自己的力量換來的。</p>
<p>南北之戰，是没有一天停止過的，最後南軍勝了，北兵敗退，於是他們重新記起一月前的仇恨來，他們在從新化到安化這一百二十里路程的中間見人便殺，逢屋就燒。這時正是九月初間，農家都已收穫，鎖在倉裏的穀子通通被燒光了，房屋成了一塊瓦坪，没有逃走的人，連骨頭都找不到；逃了回來的，滿目凄凉，妻離子散，也不想生存了。藍田有幾家人家，因爲屋裏的東西太多，害怕被别人搶了去，就守在屋子裏，誰知大火燒來，骨頭都變成了炭。謝裕通恒（替我家傳信的唯一舖子）的兩個兒子都被燒死了，各人遺下一個年輕美麗已經懷孕數月的妻子，她們一聽到丈夫被燒死了，便立刻去投河，幸而被人看見救了回來，後來這兩人的眼睛都哭瞎了。</p>

<p>— 葉蔭</p>
<p>他自己又何嘗願意呢！——</p>
<p>然而阿香終於做了街頭女。</p>
<p>天災人禍匯成了農村破産的黑潮，</p>
<p>阿香也是給這黑潮衝到上海來的一個；</p>
<p>最先，她想，上海是個黄金堆成的地方，</p>
<p>從此也許可以不再號寒呌餓</p>
<p>可是，誰曉得呢，現實的鐵錘，</p>
<p>竟會一下子就打碎了她的迷夢！——</p>
<p>不錯，阿香也有氣力，阿香也肯吃苦；</p>
<p>但你能告訴她嗎雇主究竟在西還是在東？</p>
<p>他也曾坐過一個多月的薦頭行，</p>
<p>但坐破了一張屁股也罕得有人來過問；</p>
<p>她也曾跑遍所有的絲廠和紗廠，</p>
<p>但不是在减工，便是在凖備關門。</p>
<p>最後，失望塡滿了阿香的心，</p>
<p>好幾次她都打算去投黄浦；</p>
<p>但却臨時中止了，</p>
<p>爲的是她想起了鄉下的饑寒交廹的弱弟和老母。</p>
<p>於是，阿香終於做了街頭女。——</p>
<p>然而，她自己又何嘗願意呢！</p>

<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>俘虜和娘子軍似乎也被這嚴肅的空氣嚇住，一時不敢怎麽放肆。但坑床間底抽大烟底呼呼聲，却又像吃橡皮糖似的，給這闖入者們吹得有活氣了。</p>
<p>「哦唷唷！原來胡大少爺，不做旅長哉！」一個觀音臉的大着屁股，立刻搶先往坑床間去！「乃阿是搭架子格。」同時還説出一個不蘇不白的蘇白來。</p>
<p>放下烟槍，攬腰地把那個大屁股抱了過去。咱們是老相好呀，來，乖乖，吹一曲，提一提神！讓你跟「紅頭」文學家，來一齣夜戰牛頭山，長些兒威風哪！」</p>
<p>「啊呸！乃小心倪扭壞乃個嘴巴格！」推着，大屁股又復站了起來。瞧着洞門外，二個仰臥着的醉人旁，這時居然已經各各坐上了二個「女同仁」了。而那醉人，居然也動手動脚地不知在動些什麽。祗有新文學家還在屋角頻頻地摇着頭。</p>
<p>過後，也走起來了。新文學大觀作者想洗一洗澡。好像一身已經全給這屋子裏空氣弄髒了，非用胰子擦一擦乾净不可。但當他正想向洗澡間走去之間，坑床間裏却送來一聲呌。</p>
<p>「老郭！你來！你來！」聲音顯然是胡一元的。「我給你界紹一個朋友哪，一個朋友——」</p>
<p>不容躊躇，轉了一轉身。老郭進了坑床間。</p>
<p>坑床間這時是：床上一對男的，横躺着，床邊一對女的，各各撫着男的腿子悄坐着。四對黑眼珠子，像四付銀銬子，把老郭四肢銬得僵僵的了。</p>
<p>「我給你介紹一下」胡一元揮着烟筒説「這一位是咱們漢口惟一的文學家。」</p>
<p>「唵」！一聽文學家三字就不免生氣。自己著了百萬言著作，却還不曾撈到這銜頭。現在胡一元居然輕易地把這桂冠，戴在這人頭上。好像把自己打下在三等作家裏。真有點媽媽的那個。然而那個不了，還是學一學釋迦底乖。哼了一聲「唵」吧。</p>
<p>「嘻——」對方男子可起起身了，脱去了鳥打帽的頭，在烟燈與電燈光交映下，顯示了出來。滑澤得發光，紅潤而略帶乳白色粉點，那男子像故意把這值得贊美的頭頂，給新文學家看一看似的點了點頭。立刻又仰臥倒去，説他們自己底話去了。</p>
<p>「老實，還有一件事——那，那太平洋飯店那邊，等着你呢。…我以爲，你——你雖然不要這一份。——這一份每月五十元津貼。在你真是算什麽呢。不過，不過，那是咱們報騙子——噯，是咱們辦報的人，應得的權利。終久，咱們，——咱們還辦着這麽個大的大報。而你，而你又貼了點本。有的人，哼，平時，平時不出報。不出報，一到月底了，要領乾薪了，便，便連夜，連夜趕印半版屁文字，稱是，也稱是一家小報了。五十元——五十元，也還是要拿的」！……</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>意大利和阿比西尼亞的爭端，到現在已經經過二個月了，還没有什麽妥善的辦法可解决，看起來，戰事恐怕是不能避免的，這且不必去管牠。横豎大國欺凌小國，在目前的世界，原也算是天公地道的事，那有什麽希奇？在這裏，我們所要提出來説的，是：有一位美國著名的黑種飛行家茹利安上校，這次看到意阿的衝突，就激起了一種愛護種族的熱忱，特於前月二十二日，率領駕駛員十五人，自紐約啟程前往菲洲，打算在意阿調解决裂，戰事開啟的時候，協助阿國，對意國作戰。據茹氏聲稱：阿比西尼亞爲黑種人碩果僅存的帝國，若一旦有戰爭發生，則凡在美國的黑人，皆願意參加作戰，以捍衛此國云。</p>
<p>這顯然是一個壯舉！阿比西尼亞是一個小國，意大利是一個大國。以小國的阿比西尼亞，去當大國的意大利，正像鷄卵碰石頭，戰事的成敗，是可以預先斷定的。然而阿國却偏不自量力，不甘示弱，硬着頭皮，要去和意國一拚！阿國爲爭國家的國格，出於不得已，傾全國的兵力，去對抗强敵，還説得過去。呌人驚奇的，是這一位遠居美國的「黑英雄」茹利安，因爲眼看着意國太恃强了，一時忍耐不住，就激動了愛種的熱誠，特地從紐約率領了十五名的戰士，到菲洲來預備參戰，助同種的阿國，以抗異種的意國。這真是一個千古罕有的壯舉！</p>
<p>茹氏並不是一條蠢虫，他本身原是知道自己的力量，是非常薄弱的，實不足以救阿國。然而他却意堅志决，奮不顧身，要親臨前綫去對抗强敵，這爲的是什麽？爲的無他，愛護種族而已！因爲愛護種族，故情願爲種族而犧牲，置生死於度外！</p>
<p>有茹利安的抱負，才配得稱一個「民族英雄！」</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>下了幾天雪，並不是没有作踏雪尋梅的雅興，無奈老太太談鋒獨健，她特爲我在書房里生了個火盆，自早至暮伴着孫兒來談天，飯也由黄媽送進來。她説下雪天她常獨自兒圍爐誦經，從前還有只狸奴，躱在懷里假唸經，那情味是怪消閑的，不過寂寞一點。意思之間如今有客來長談是她求之不得的事。幸而我也有這一手本領，什麽事都胡扯得有頭有尾，把三個飛着漫天大雪的日子消閑過去了。</p>
<p>今天淡黄色的陽光已經溜上我的寫字台，推開了三天緊閉的長窗，院子里堆滿了三寸來厚的白銀，除了中間出進的走道，深深吸了口冷空氣，胸襟爲之一暢。對於旅行養病我認爲是最好的方法，因爲無論一草一木，變換了環境都覺得意外的親切，不過像我輩以身體換麵包的很難求得這種機會罷了。</p>
<p>早餐後，從行裝中搜出一支爬山的杖，徵得老太太的同意挾了她七歳的孫兒爲伴，到鄉後第一次出門。</p>
<p>雪霽的天空，明朗淸潔，眼前又是這般如錦如繡的銀世界，置物在這樣的景物中，行路有些飄飄然了。朋友的家是僻居的獨家村，新雪後行路並泥濘載道，那孩子恐怕難得有出遊的機會，他總離我十武之前。一路行來，不由地湧起雅人的詩興來。</p>
<p>不過那是種妄想，前人的作品也難能背誦上口，自家兒腸子里的胡説本領是無用武之地了。但是隨意東扯西凑地胡吟着已很够味兒。而且許多幻想都湧上心來，如果騎一頭驢，那孩子而是個小童，那樣即使找不出梅樹的踪蹟，不詩意盎然了嗎？</p>
<p>鄉間多樹木，那些枯枝上滿堆着厚厚的雪花，間或有幾只覓食的麻雀來棲息，樹枝受了驚動而灑下來的雪花，遠遠望去，彷彿噴泉，—在詩人的筆底下</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，或者是黄河之水天上來了。然而我不是詩人，這個勝地在中國名勝中也不見牠的名字的，誇大的描寫，要被人視爲痴人説夢的；再自私地説，江南草長的杭州，把四方八處的人都會集於此，你就尋不出西子的一塊乾净土了。這窮鄉僻隅的完土，希望牠别受到那種殘酷的蹂躪罷！</p>
<p>從小道上蜿蜒曲折行來，被一曲淸溪阻隔了前程，從密密的叢林中向前窺探，大概不至盡在於此，勝地往往有奇峯突出的誘惑。不過那孩子不是個道地的嚮導，我又是個生客，在微微覺得疲乏的時候，就拂去了雪花在白石上坐下來休息了。</p>
<p>小溪里凍過冰，北半的積雪没有溶解。河畔蘆葦蔓延，雪層和太陽照射的光綫組織成了奇觀的頭法。這時候我想起少帶了一個鏡箱，不然也該使懷念我病狀的朋友們體味得我的悠悠自樂爲我慶賀；而况這種難得機緣刹那間就要失却的呵，雖然或許牠供給我一個更瀟洒的面目！</p>
<p>無意間投了一塊小石子，三五只野鳬鷺惶地從蘆草間飛出來，没頭没腦地。附近的雪花都溶解在淸溪里，我後悔做了件罪惡的事，這刹那間，要失却的奇景却由我扮演了殘酷的劊子手呢！心中久久不釋，再没有心意去探求叢林前面的秘密了！（鄉居雜記之三）</p>
<h3 id="c205">崑山一日遊 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 浪人</p>
<p>車一到崑山車站，崑山上的尖塔便在眼中躍現出來。從車軌上的天橋走過，擠在人羣中，一道石子馬路便夾在冬天的枯樹間給擺在眼前。</p>
<p>崑山的城市正和一切中國古老的城市一樣，被狹小的道路和矮小的屋子所擁擠着。</p>
<p>僱着人力車子做引導，我們是被帶到歸有光的墓前。一塊石碑，一個圓塚，算是這有明一代的大文人的宿地。境地荒凉，無甚可閲。對於我們青年人，既没有懷古之心，便於一瞥之後，决意他去了。</p>
<p>只有一個古老的墓門尚在腦中記憶下來。</p>
<p>中午在一家館子里吃飯，熱哄哄地四個圓桌子，把我們這班青年人裝滿着。青年人是具有活躍的心的，便在幾杯老花雕下放浪形駭起來。女人們是常常在團體里起着作用的，紅紅的臉頰常常把整個團體攪成一片歡聲。</p>
<p>用飯後趕車到馬鞍山去。長長的石級把過慣平地生活的我們的脚力有點被軟化起來。一達到山巔，大家便不免喘了一口氣。古寺里木魚聲喧，僧徒們正唸着經咒。方丈把我們供在一間小禪堂里，而禪味是關不住這些青年的野馬的心的，於是便在佛前玩起求籖的把戲來。某男士和某女士求到了上上的籖單時，一陣戀愛成功的慶祝聲便被喧呼起來。</p>
<p>在山巔上望下去，整個的崑山和一片廣大的平疇便收在眼底。我們也像林主席遊崑山時一樣，竟在寺前也攝起像來。</p>
<p>在半繭園我們休息下來。青年們怱怱地携着像機，四處獵取景象，收入鏡底。黄花是萎謝了，半繭園留不住我們的脚跡。</p>
<p>從崑山圖書館里被取到顧亭林的手跡。這位明末的經世者的郡國利病書，曾被我們在國難期間注意了一下。然而顧亭林是死去了，而時代已非是古人的時代。郡國利病書除一度被收入鏡頭之外，恐怕存着很少的價值的了。</p>
<p>已經是傍晚了，從狹隘崎嶇的石道上走回崑山車站。赤裸的枯枝上是漸漸罩起晚烟了，車站上又擠滿了人影。</p>
<p>某先生提了一只鴨脯和餅物，另一位先生便調笑地説：</p>
<p>「中午的鴨麵還吃得不够麽？」</p>
<p>「是送給——？」另一位先生的話。</p>
<p>一陣笑聲便激起來。</p>
<p>女士們因爲等車等得太無聊，便在站上嬉戲起來了。引起了全體客人的注意，把冬天收縮的頸子都伸長起來。</p>
<p>車開起來了。田野被黑夜統治着。除了車上的燈光，四野是完全黑暗了。</p>
<p>燦爛的燈光顯示着上海的到來。一日的别離，見着燈光倒也會覺到歡快；而崑山的一日遊便被抛在腦後了。</p>
<h3 id="c206">拾貝人手記 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>二月的風像飛輪那樣地滾着來了；田野裏，海灘上，全隱隱地飄着一種自然界的暗示的聲息；像詩，像牧歌，像六弦琴的低語：</p>
<p>「北風隱息的季節，海灘上的風都帶着甜味了，水裏消失了冰塊，泥地上却長起了綠色的小草來啦。」</p>
<p>春天的召喚像晨鐘那樣的，把蟄伏了一冬的拾貝人的夢都悠悠地衝破了。</p>
<p>於是起身來對這外面的世界重又投了驚奇地一眼：季候是不懂得説謊的；真的，水面上消失了冰塊，海面上的風已没有了那種苛酷的鹹味的尖利了：天空是晶藍，明朗，而廣闊。沙灘上飛起了三兩隻鷗鳥。世界是静的，噯昧的，而人的心胸却無邊際地開朗了呢。</p>
<p>對海也投了一次好意的問候的眼光，而把隔宿的對險濤的仇恨一起忘掉了——海是頂偉大的，她是地面的天空，伸展着有無邊的廣大，人是難以測量出她底盡頭了。</p>
<p>我得感謝，春天把許慈祥的「母親的海」又帶給我們了，而瞧着她，却有了更年青的姿態，與青青的無限大的浪花了呢。</p>
<p>於是我對着太陽——剛在地平綫上露臉的太陽，深深地吸了一口朝氣，便開始用神志來對付那些在海的懷抱中馳騁着的波浪——它們像沙漠上的輕騎兵，也像火綫上的戰士，毫無容情地一個走向一個的前面去，跟着，便又把前面的一個吞没了。</p>
<p>巨浪的相撲給了我一陣新的懍慄。</p>
<p>然而，駭濤對拾貝人是十分平常的啊，爲了尋覓一些永久的，寳貴的東西，在一串的早晨與夜晚，冒着粗野的狂潮，奮不顧身地便蹤到險浪裏去了：身子是不由自主地給一種大力推擠着，究竟會給推到什麽地方去是連自己都不知道的；於是：便抛棄了人世間的繫念，抛棄了渺茫的命運，而把全部的生存的本能放到一種目的上去了：去把那些晶亮的貝殻檢過來，在這裏邊，是不可知地存在着一種光明，一種珍寳，一種耀眩人底眼睛的珠子呢！</p>
<p>就是這一種偉大的目的：它能使一個幼小的拾貝者忘掉了海的空曠，潮水的大力，與波濤的險惡的：讓我把那些光亮的東西檢過來吧；不然，便讓我給浪花吞没。</p>
<p>便那樣地，一個個悠長的日子來了，又過去了；而拾貝人却不斷地在搏着駭濤，吸着鹹風；心頭是恐怖的，然而在這恐怖中存在着的，又該是多少的好意與期望呢？</p>
<p>於是有一個日子終於來到了：在無量的貝殻中有一顆真珠在放着光，照眩了拾貝人的眼睛，也沸騰了拾貝人的動的心。</p>
<p>一遍一遍地尋思着：「是夢幻呢還是真實呢？」</p>
<p>懂得了：是現實；然而這現實是：在理想中撒下了努力與勇敢的種子的啊。</p>
<p>縱然説，拾貝人是有着流浪人的孤寂，與亡命者的粗野的；但是我却知道，淸楚的知道：有一天，他也會升起詩一般的微笑的呢。</p>
<p>前面是無邊的海，與滾滾的波浪，然而早就説過了，駭濤在拾貝人是不以爲奇的。爲了一種更大的理想中的成就，我終於又一次地泅向無邊的駭惡的破濤中去了。</p>

<h3 id="c211">英國各車廠製造尚武汽車的狂熱 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>注意尚武汽車　這可以説是真實的事情。英國的各汽車廠。以往對於社會方面。所貢獻的車輛。除了運輸之外。其餘什麽都不顧到的。也更不顧車主把金錢所換得的車輛。價值是如何。然結就眼前的情形説來。和過往顯然已是不同。每一次汽車展覽所展示給我們的。使我們知道尚武汽車的市塲。已獨樹一幟。而車輛本身的價值。更在逐年的進歩。在這篇短短的文章之中。如果要説能够把一九三五式英製尚武汽車的優點。完全介紹於讀者。這當然是一件不可能的事情。如果要把尚武汽車和蓬車分得淸楚。更是不大容易。某一個時期。大家以爲車頂堅質的。便不是尚武新車。但這種原則。現在已完全不適用了。尤其是這裏有很多嚴肅的兩用轎車。行駛的時候。能够有尚武汽車的精神。</p>
<p>製造方面革新　如果要買一輛敞車身。而並不是尚武式的。那便更難。雖然一流綫型在非敞車上。早已採用好久。目前敞車的上面。也已開始採用。至於尚武車的車身。製造方面。大致説來。和一年以前。一九三四式新車並無重大改革。所有的雨具。比較少一些。更希望要改良。尤其是在真車頂的敞車之中。有的雨具。摺疊以後。可以遮蔽視綫。而且車輛在行駛之時。更有種種無限制的聲音。有時更會拖下一塊棉布。有的新車身。重量方面。比較增加一些。也許會有許多車主。寗可每小時犧牲一二哩速率。爲了車身的分量一重。裝配在底盤之上。也更見穩固了。有的車廠。關於車身的製造。雖然是很小的汽車。現在也顧到後面設有行李箱架。以作長途旅行或長途競賽時應用。然而關於這點。製造的時候。也是煞費苦心呢。有的人更以爲與其把行李箱放在遮蓋的一部。不如把保險車胎除去。</p>
<p>駕駛位置改良　尤其是極速而半競賽式的新車。本年度座位所佔的地方。比上年度改進了。注意到「如果駕駛一輛汽車。要神速而安全。應得時常看見兩個前輪。可能的話。始終要看見的。」的一種説理。關於這點。也許有一二種小的新車。還要改良。但大體上都比去年進歩了。另外我們有一種分析英製尚武新車的方法。便是根據歷次參加汽車競賽所獲得的榮譽。我們一定承認。有一種新車。脱冷夫二立突白雲石牌。是一輛英國製造的新車。設計的時候。完全以適合參加新式汽車競賽爲標凖。可是平時也可當做别種用途。新車有汽缸八隻。用雙冒頭凸輪桿。由汽缸全體的中心點驅動。很好的乾油池催滑。有樑柱支撑的車架。重力的中心點很低。每小時可行駛一○○哩。其次有一種三立突半六缸勃德蘭車。售價並不高。可是在汽車競賽會中。速率也可到達每小時一○○哩。的確是一輛很美觀的新車。轎車或敞車可以兩用者。製造方面。原料之中。攙入的高質混合金不在少數。有名的英國製尚武汽車。本年度當然有很多新車。貢獻於我們。尤其值得注意的。便是美琪車廠的出品。在舊大陸上。歷來參加汽車競賽的結果。已得過不少榮譽。這裏在各種競賽車中。我們可以發現Q式美琪牌七五○立方生的四汽缸新車。和或是很像商用汽車的K式三號瑪格納新車。在英國也曾獲得過不少榮譽。上面所説的兩種新車。以速率説來。每分鐘都可行駛兩哩。另外的尚武汽車。有S式七五○立方生的美琪車。瑪格那一，一○○六方生的六缸車。和N式一，二八七立方生的六缸瑪格納新車等。S式每小時可行駛七十五哩。N式每小時八十哩。都有很引人注目的敞車身裝在上面。</p>
<p>大號車輛一斑　另外英國製造的尚武汽車。更有一種很榮譽的。便是多寳塔。這種新車的上面。我們可以發現有離心式的分合機。和早選齒輪盒。三立突半的新車。製造得非常精美。而著名的「九五」式和「一○五」式。也依舊有相當的成績。奥利維斯二十匹馬力汽車。過往也受過極大的歡迎。一九三五式的引擎。二，七六二立方生的。六汽缸。仍舊用領到專賣證的多式汽門彈簧。前輪獨立懸吊。爲了底盤的特優。駕駛的時候。有特殊的成績。在蓬車之中。更有一種特殊成績的。便是四立突半萊貢特車。並不加價。在英製每小時行路一○○哩尚武汽車中。萊比特新式底盤。亦爲工程上的進歩出品。引擎六汽缸。四，四六七立方生的SU式化油器兩座。雙發火。此種新車。更有一種特點。即採克琳式塞車系統。新式三立突半新車。也是一種革新的出品。售價祗六九五鎊。小號一，一○四立方生的。萊博爾四缸汽車。用雙冒頭凸輪桿者。仍舊爲敞車。克利福特一，一○○立方生的新車。或可作爲競賽汽車之用。過往已有顯著的成績。</p>
<p>康天寗及其他　今再一述康天寗所出各種新車。亞爾發羅穆號車一共有兩種。一九—六三匹馬力和一九—七六匹馬力。都是二，二立突。直列八缸新車。這種新車。雖和每小時行一七○哩的弗拉利巨型車相似。但行駛非常神速。而極像商用尚武車。另外形式方面。更是美觀。流綫型的轎車。更是著名。七十六匹馬力的新車。引擎的轉動。每分鐘已發展至四，四○○次。也是雙凸輪桿。引擎曲柄棍有軸承七個。寳克的車。就夏令配亞汽車展覧説來。近幾年來。用途很廣。「五七」式中。有一種三三牌新車。在任何情狀之下。都可採用最高擋行駛。非常神速。馬賽德斯新車之中。有一種兩人座尚武新車。裝有五立突直列八缸引擎。實馬力發展到最高度時。可達一六○匹。也是前輪獨立懸吊。其他車輛。展覽於大會者。大都注重旅行而不在尚武。而一，三○○立方生的後引擎流綫型底盤。是馬賽德斯的新出品。製造的時候。經過不少考慮。</p>
<p>側列汽門新車　此外更有一種意大利式。在尚武車中。可佔一席者。便是QM新車。也許用側列汽門的。就是這一種。OHV底盤。的確非常盛行。OM牌車在歷史上本以採用側列汽門引擎著名。静默潤滑。加速的易如。在這六缸引擎中。都是可靠的。在小汽車中。英國的出品。勝人一籌。自有不少特點。爲海外各國所贊美的。在一立突半的新車中。有弗蘭莎納喜和奥斯當馬丁兩種。在汽車競賽中。都曾獲過無上的榮譽。前者尤其是有特殊的優點。力和量的比率。爲任何車輛所不及的。奥斯當馬丁通常是低而光滑。極像商用的汽車。納喜有四缸和六缸兩種。（包括一，六五七立方生的新車。）AM是一，四九六立方生的。四汽缸車。有凸輪桿。尤其是採用乾油池。雙催滑。列門斯和TT兩種。更是本年度極好的出品。</p>
<p>最近出品種種　英國沙爾蒙。這個名稱。是跟着奥斯當馬丁而來的。是一種舊式而製造得很好的底盤。馬力祇一七—七○匹。是一種最時行的四人座敞車。外觀最美的一種一九三五式尚武新車。是AC愛司牌。汽缸六隻。一，九○○立方生的。冒頭凸輪桿。三架化油器。是很整潔的一輛四人座尚武車。這種新車。車身的上面。更連着行李箱。奥斯丁汽車之中。最有名是一種改進的「六五」式尚武新車。配着兩人座七匹馬力的底盤。另外有三種英國製新車。值得我們牢記着。便是利蘭。脱冷夫。和星球。第一種在競賽會中。過去已有過驚人的成績。本年度依舊保持這種優點。其中更有一種一立突半四缸玲克斯四人座車身。十五匹MPH兩人座車身。都是目前尚武車中最整潔的車輛。九匹四汽缸茵潑新車。輪距很短。盛名不减康天寗。脱冷夫白雲石牌車。上文已經説過。在外更有一種克勞拉四缸或六缸車。和南克洛斯兩人座新車。新式克勞拉車。目前已加至一，二三二立方生的。共有兩種。基凖牌和威德斯牌。後者所用的凸輪桿。製造比較特别一些。</p>
<p>星球注意敞車　星球近年以來。對於尚武汽車的製造。日見向上。目前更已確定地位。一九三五式新車中。包括萊蒙九匹底盤。和一種萊蒙特速新車。三化油器六汽缸。一立突半的引擎。在喜臨門廠的出品之中。小寳寳四缸一。一八五立方生的引擎的新車。最速時可達七十匹馬力。</p>
<p>馬律師尚武車　馬律斯車廠。本年度也有一種很整潔的尚武新車。裝在「一○—六」式的底盤上面。雙化油器。一·三七八立方生的。六汽缸引擎。這種新車。試騐的結果。已證明了在敞車之中。是最安適而表演最佳的新車。高速度十四正羅佛四人座敞車。更是一種驚人的新車。行駛的神速。爲空前所少有。萊爾登新車。座位的特别。成爲弧形。行駛的神速。外觀的美麗。也是一種代表的車輛。除了上面所説的種種尚武車之外。更有不少著名的新車。渡過大西洋。行銷於海外的英國製新式尚武車。像羅爾魯意斯。日光特動。和重汽車如每小時行路百哩的特拉求。奥斯當特拉。達拉克。希潑諾蘇賽。伊沙法西却尼。霍基斯等等。小號比利拉飛霞車。是意大利的典型出品。在過去二年之中。這種車輛的成績。早已由競賽會證明了。也是冒頭汽門。九九五立方生的。四缸引擎。行動很光澤。最速的時候。可達八十匹實馬力。總之。所有一九三五式尚武汽車。進歩的驚人。已足證明英國各廠。對於製造尚武汽車。興趣的濃厚了。</p>
<p>本埠合衆汽車公司。兹已運到一九三五年式奥斯摩别爾汽車一大批。今日正在開箱裝配。大約明後天即可在樣子間正式陳列。圖爲一九三五年式奥斯摩别爾六缸四門轎車。外觀華麗。內部寛宏。六人同坐。胥極舒暢。前後座位加闊。馬達與坐位移前。所有乘客。均係置身於輪軸之間。倍覺安適。至於膝關動作。並已採作新車之標準裝置。</p>
<h3 id="c212">行車時空氣阻力的計算法 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>汽車行駛的時候，無形中有空氣的阻力在阻止車身的前進。這種阻力是隨着車身的速度而增加。牠足以使引擎的能力减少。是行車上一種不能免的損失。但是這種阻力究竟有多大。以前各國的工程師雖然做過多次的實騐。例如風</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>洞的試騐等等。但是所得的結果。都不能確切的表明。</p>
<p>我們知道在風洞內試騐時。車身是静止的。同時。空氣却在流動。和實際行車時的現象相反（實際行車時車身行動而空氣静止。）所以所得的結果不能滿意。後來有的工程師把車身放在車底上。用滾軸隔離。當引擎行駛時。車身因空氣阻力作用滑向後方。這樣就可知道空氣阻力與車速的關係。但以上的方法。都是測定這空氣阻力的大概性質。而不能絶對的知道牠有多少。</p>
<p>直到最近。美國某工程學會方纔發明了一種精確的空氣阻力實地試騐。牠的理論非常簡單並且饒有興趣。牠是完全利用物體的情性作用。去測定阻力。</p>
<p>當車身向前加速行駛時。車廂內的人們會覺得他們的身體向前傾斜。反之。殺車或减速率行駛時。人們的身子就會向後傾仰。現在這空氣阻力新試騐。就根基這個道理，試騐時用一個特製的擺。掛在車身的旁面。使牠可以自由地前後擺動，擺的旁邊。另外裝置一個半圓形的刻度表。當車身加速時。這擺就向後移動。减速時就向前傾出。動作是非常靈敏。</p>
<p>試騐時先把車身加速至某一程度。使不變動。因爲空氣的阻力輪胎和引擎阻力的作用。使車身漸漸的慢下來。這時候車廂內的乘客是絶對不會覺察到。因爲這種减速是很小很小。但是這感覺靈敏的擺。却立刻顯出車身减速的程度。這樣一來。車身上總共的阻力。在任何一個速度。都可以從這擺的刻度表上讀下來。這種刻度表。都直接刻着每噸幾磅的阻力單位。讀起來很便利。</p>
<p>在很長的平路上試騐結果。先把車身加速至每小時五十四英里。刻度表上讀出每噸一○五磅。速率至每小時四五英里减到極慢。（差不多同走路一樣）。表上就讀出三十磅（每噸）的記錄。這三十磅的記錄。實在就是車輪的純粹「滾阻力」</p>
<p>刻度表上的記錄。是表明空氣和車輪的混合阻力。但是因爲滾阻力在任何速率不變動的緣故。所以每一記錄减去三十磅的滾阻力。就可得到空氣的阻力（每噸）如其車身的總重噸數知道。那麽把這噸數乘上每噸空氣阻力。就可得到總共空氣阻力。</p>
<p>計算空氣阻力最精確的公式。現在已被一般工程師定下來。例如</p>
<p>F=KAY2代表空氣阻力（每噸）。A代表車前的面積（方尺）。</p>
<p>V則代表每小時速率（英里）。K是一種恒數。隨着車身的式樣而變動。車身愈流綫化。則K的值愈小。</p>
<p>從上面公式看來。K可以從擺的刻度上讀出。A可以用尺直接量出。V亦可從速度計上讀出。這樣一來。K的數值。就可很精確的算出。牠的絶對值。大概在0.00175與0.00187之間。下面的記錄。是一輛轎車試騐的結果。車身闊五尺九寸。高五尺六寸。車前面積二十六方尺。車重一·七五噸。</p>
<p>這個實騐最重要的結果。就是K的測定。因爲K的數值測定後。任何速率時的空氣阻力。就可從上面的公式算出來。同時因空氣阻力兩消失的能力。也可以從速率和空氣阻力算出。這實在是再便利也没有。</p>
<p>據多次試騐結果。K的理想值應當是。○○一九到·○○二。但是因爲種種的關係。例如速度計之不能絶對精確等。所以K的究竟絶對值。還未能確定。不過在上述的限度內。現在一般流綫化的車身。可以很安全的採用啊。</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>赫德森汽車公司自起用所有舊職員之後。製造工程日見周至。産額亦因之激增。現且有再行擴充。及添招新職員之説。工作效率。可見已經增進。一九三五年之赫德森。殆已爲世界人士所注意。其各項記錄之驚人已造成數百萬人樂用赫德森矣。</p>
<p>地上飛汽車之效力盡人皆知。蓋地上飛愛山克水汽車殆亦爲一般人所樂道。地上飛記錄之試騐。與其他之汽車試騐方法逈異。蓋欲求其精確也。美國汽車恊會競賽部訂定之地上飛汽車競賽章程不同凡例。其方法凖確不爽厘毫。此可見地上飛汽車之在一般汽車中成績與衆不同矣。</p>
<p>美國汽車恊會之地上飛汽車競賽。地上飛汽車二輛。用已經標凖時計部校凖之自停表六隻。裝於靈巧異常之特式厘中。可同時走動或停止。六表既經開動之後。携至山麓之上。該處有計時員三人。適當出發點上。各授以走動之錶一隻。以便用以計時。同樣走動之其餘表三隻。則携之於山嶺上之競賽終點處。該處亦有計時員三人。持此三錶。車啓行之後。在山麓之三錶即停止。至到達終點之後其他山嶺上終點處之三錄亦停止。更將二方之各三錶平均之。得二數量。該二數量之差。即爲車行於中途所耗之時間。其凖確爲必然。赫德森汽車亦曾數次有良好之記錄。而於一九三五年之製品中更見周至於此點之顧及。可隨時以此項方法檢查車中機件也。</p>
<p>赫德森汽車公司始創於一九○九年。其所有赫德森汽車公司之歷史記錄之中。有關於赫德森汽車之樂爲一般人所用之一點。據精細之調查所知。赫德森汽車自開始營業迄今。綜計其所售車輛中依然完好如新者至今猶有百分之七十以上。該百分之七十赫德森車現在尚在市上開行。該項記載之中且註明該百分之七十之赫德森所得主顧之姓名地址及應用之詳細情形。此足以證明赫德森汽車之出品决非平常不耐於多用之汽車可比也。</p>
<p>又有詳實之報告。美洲境內之赫德森汽車主。爲數現達一百五十萬人。一般車夫對於其所購車輛之效用宏厚。彌經久用。蓋今人購車不復徒憑機會而罔置實際。皆須選購動作之效能。一九三四之赫德森與地上飛已爲人所樂道。此一九三五年中之赫德森與地上飛爲人歡迎。可以意料也。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（九）却爾斯雷改變作風的失敗</p>
<p>和那齊摩伐同時同一攝影塲工作的，還有一位魯道爾夫范侖鐵諾（Rudolph　Valentino）。此外還有雷門諾伐羅（Ramon　Novarro），愛麗絲德莉（Alice　Jerry），梅茂蘭（Mae　Murray）等等。</p>
<p>但是却爾斯雷（Charles　Ray）却是當時男明星中，最受人歡迎的一個。他本來是一個鄉村少年，他在銀幕上所顯示給大衆看的，亦是一位恬静，羞澀，而怯弱的少年。他的成功，所以受人歡迎，亦就在這一點上，可是他成功，享受了大名之後，他决定了要改變他的作風。他想擲去了破草帽，脱去了工人穿的連衣袴，而穿上了常服，扮起一位社會人物起來。這種改變作風的事情，在銀幕歷史上是數見不鮮的，但是這種試騐的成敗，關係於一個明星的前途的極大，我們不能不比較進一層的討論一下。</p>
<p>改變作風，至少是件冒險的事情。因爲觀衆們是電影事業絶對的主宰，影片的好壞，明星的盛哀，都繫於觀衆們心理的向背。這個理論，從前已經提出過。現在以却爾斯雷而論，他的所以成功，就因爲觀衆喜歡看他那副鄉曲少年，靦覥退縮的狀態……就如同後來的觀衆們，喜歡看珍妮蓋諾的靦覥恬静的做作一樣……他們如果不喜歡看你扮演别種作風，無論你覺得怎樣厭倦你舊有的作風，無論你覺得你能在作風改變了之後，表演得怎樣好，那都是不成功的。</p>
<p>却爾斯雷在那個時候，還没有深切了解觀衆們的心理，和觀衆們迭克推多式的權威，他决定了要創造一個偉大而永久的作品。他表示他的决心起見，他單獨組織了一個公司，他將他所有的資財，都傾注在那公司之內，認真地要將一齣名劇（Court-hip　of　Miles　Standish）。搬到銀幕上去。他非但將全部的金錢，放進那企圖裏面，他的全副精神，亦都灌注在那件事上了。</p>
<p>他爲了要使影片，臻於至詳確的地歩，他聘請了幾位有名的考証家和歷史家。那雖然是個大胆的企圖，但却爾斯雷相信將來成功之後，在藝術上面是有不可磨滅的價值的。在藝術上，不差是有價值的，但是觀衆們看見了却爾斯雷穿著淸净教徒的服裝，就大不以爲然地跳了起來。這樣，他們喪失了他們平素所喜歡看的一個鄉村少年，並且連新作風的影片，亦不喜觀看了。</p>
<p>這次企圖的失敗，非但使却爾斯雷喪失了歷年所積聚的金錢，并且使他喪失了觀衆們的同情。他於失意之餘，就此脱離了銀幕。等到過了幾年之後，他又加入了米高梅公司，想重理舊業，但是他所喪失的，却是往而不復了。他在米高梅的新片中，戴著高帽，穿着禮服，儼然社交人物。那張片子，叫「巴黎」，亦有相當的成就，但却不是因爲却爾斯雷，而是因爲一個新進的女伶，她的名字叫瓊克勞馥。那「巴黎」就成了一個新陳代謝的樞杻。舊的努力掙扎著要回，新的是努力掙扎著要進去。回來却不容易，進去的倒成功了。到了現瓊克勞馥已成了行極一時的女星，但是却爾斯雷呢？他現在降爲了一個默默無聞的零碎角色。蒼雲白狗，亦盡極人間滄桑之感了。</p>
<p>由此可見，電影事業是多半繫於人的問題的，而電影事業的産品，亦不過是人的個性而已。等到那個個性被觀衆們認定了之後，演員如果要改變他固有的個性，是十分之九的自促其失敗，因爲觀衆心目的成見，已是牢不可破的了。珍妮蓋諾是一位甜蜜可愛的女子，如果她扮作一個老於世故的交際花，就不合觀衆們的脾胃了。如果葛萊泰嘉寳放棄她那神秘的外套，而居然扮起輕鬆，滑稽的角色來，無論她天才如何，表演如何，結果就成了大笑話了。</p>
<p>觀衆們自始即是如此。現在還是這樣。以後亦永遠是這樣堅持著他們的成見的。（未完）</p>

<p>（一）作者小史　托爾斯泰Leo　Tolstoy一八二八——一九○是俄國的作家，宗教家，其作品於近代文藝界的思想，不但俄國，竟可説全世界都受到相當影響。托氏的一生，完成三大傑作，便是「戰爭與和平」，「安那加列尼那」，「復活」，其他長短篇作品，不勝枚舉，各國都有譯本，於量的方面，也可稱爲近代文學第一位作家了。他的一生，由肉的生活向靈的生活，是求道的苦鬥的生活。五十歳才對於生活起了疑問，遂發生一大轉變其解决發見於以色列福音，表白原始基督教的信仰。「我的懺悔」便是爲這種苦悶而發表，呌出了無抵抗主義，無財産主義，汎勞動主義，同胞主義，以宗教家及社會改良家的立足點而活動。晚年爲求他的生活澈底起見，便抛却愛妻而出家，但在中途逝世，享年八十二歳。</p>
<p>（二）故事略述　「復活」是托氏七十歳時作的小説，是上述三大巨著之一。在影片上的名稱改作We　Live　Aagain　Resurrection。故事的內容，寫娼婦麥斯洛代因有謀死狎客的嫌疑被拘，付公判，公判中的一人耐夫留獨夫見而大驚，因此女即爲彼伯母家中的侍女加邱耶，當十年前，彼爲青年士官時，曾因過伯母家借宿而誘姦了她。她因此得孕，不能再爲侍女，又爲他所棄，便墮落爲娼婦。耐夫獨留夫以爲她的如此，一切起因於已，所以想救她，並且要和她結婚，以贖前罪。他到獄中去看她，但她已不認識他。耐夫獨留夫便百方營救，但罪已决定，他便跟了囚徒的一隊同赴西比利亞。起初她大罵他，後來見他誠實，便因而感化，漸漸回復她本來的良心，並不欲和他結婚，以妨他的幸福之路。耐亦諒其善意，不再窮究。會有政治犯西摩松，知加邱耶已改心，願娶之。加丘耶對西摩亦有意，耐夫獨留夫便把加丘耶托西摩松，而自己更進而從事救濟萬人的大業。托氏最後的講救濟社會，便是在發揮他所抱的大主張，在思想上，就所謂托爾斯泰主義的作品。</p>
<p>（三）男女主角　俄藉新星安娜史丹，在好萊塢的處女作「娜娜」一片，而她的第二片便是主演「復活」，飾侍女加丘耶一角，不但美麗動人，更能摹仿前人的動作，表演一個俄國的農家女，充滿了情緒，再適當没有。茀特立馬區在「閏怨」一片中，驚人的演出，已得到相當的評價，而在「復活」裏面，他便是男主角，飾耐夫獨留夫，成績如何，在没有演出之前，我們未便先下判斷，但在我們的預料中，他將不致令人失望。全片攝製的時候，關於佈景和風俗人情等等，都力求像真俄國事前更經過相當的研討。</p>

<p>聯華影業公司本年度以「大路」及「新女性」兩片，震驚影壇，復揭「主力車出動」之旗幟，以十二大影片爲號召，觀其所列出品，足微其陣綫之鞏固强大，環顧影壇，殆無其匹，證以「蛇蝎美人」一片而益信。該片陳義。精警有力，尤妙在劇情通俗而又不落尋常窠臼，片中所謂美人，原非蛇蝎，然於無意間，每釀成種種罪惡，其流毒之深，蓋有甚於蛇蝎者，本片之張翼，縱情女色，抛妻棄子，及至春夢年醒，已是家散人亡，如此結局，雖非其本身有以致之，要亦不能歸罪於美人也。張翼以豪邁之個性，飾慾海之莽夫，悔悟，瘋狂諸塲，極見表演功夫之老到，其前途之遠大，蓋爲識者所公認。陳燕燕飾少婦，一腔幽怨，抑鬱以終，演來極爲生色，梁賽珍之蕩婦，動作不流於冶蕩，而自然有其動人處，做工之穩練，爲向來所未有，本片以三人之合作，精到之表演，成績之佳，自不待言，昨日觀過者，無不嘖嘖稱道，可見公論自在人心也。</p>

<p>中國之電影事業，近年來已有顯著之進展。編導技巧，演員影藝，已不可與前期之電影同日而語，故國産影片風起雲湧，映期打破有電影史來紀錄。在藝術上言，亦可與西洋名片相頑頡。電影藝人頗受大衆之擁護，在社會上已護得相當之地位。電影刋物，因之大量産生，但對於演員整個系統介紹之讀物竟付闕如。藝聲出版社有鑒於斯，特請活動於電影界之攝影專家陳嘉震，編輯「中國電影明星大觀」，以畫片爲主體，凡顯身銀幕者皆被列入，而均爲本書特攝者。又有歷史價值之珍奇電影照片，爲外間所不經見者。照片大半出自陳氏親攝，用最新頴之角度，排列用最高貴之紙料印刷。其成績美滿，定可預卜，不日開始預約云。</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>英國高蒙出品……喬治亞理斯主演</p>
<p>一八一五年的春天，和平重降於歐洲大陸。戰神高高站在天空之中，俯視着瘡痍滿目的大地，浸滿了二十年來兵連禍結中，男兒的熱血，現在日月重光，五穀復生，民間又顯着一片熙攘往來之聲，不覺惡狠狠地從鼻子裏哼了一聲。他縐着眉，很不耐煩的等他的時機，好再向人間吐出他口中破壤毁滅的兇燄。</p>
<p>在那厄爾巴小島上，意大利海岸之南，一個人正站在亂石巉巉的海邊，悵然望着北面水天銜接之處，隱約如見法國故鄉。他就是一世之雄的拿破侖。怒潮一陣一陣的打在他脚底下的石頭上，告訴他有翅難飛，昔日天上的蒼鷹，今天已處在樊籠之中了。</p>
<p>拿破侖邦那巴！二十年以來，他的名字已經隨着軍隊的鐵蹄傳遍了各地，已經隨着死亡毁滅的喪歌，而佈滿了塵寰。他以一人而敵天下，那個天下，曾經一時已在他的掌握之中，但是現在那個天下，和一切合併起來合他對抗的敵人，已將他擊破，將他囚了起來，放逐在地中海裏一個小島上，讓他去自生自滅。他是那個和平，是多末短促的和平呀！那個站在海濱的人，身材雖是渺小，但他的一顆雄心，却不是可以像野獸那樣圈禁起來的。况且故鄉在望，他的威名尚未全去。所以過了幾個星期……</p>
<p>在那維也納的宫中，各國的君王能和權貴，一班勝利者，正在集議着如何瓜分這勝利的碩果，他們，叫囂爭鬥，大言欺人，總想自己得着比别人多些。普魯士王在那裏，驕蹇而暴厲他和奥國的謀臣麥泰湼，一位温厚有禮，聰明過人，而成見甚深的人，坐在會議桌子的一端，還有法國的外交家泰勒蘭，曾一度充任拿破侖的權臣，但是現在却又代表了重登法蘭西王位的波邦族，出席於這歷史上有名的維也納會議了。</p>
<p>其中却有一個人，並不像别人的喧呶咆哮。他静坐在一旁，舒閒自在的伸直了他的兩腿，他面上帶着輕蔑的微笑。那就是威靈登公爵，就是曾經率領了各國聯軍，擊敗拿破侖，將波邦王族扶上了王位的人。他的所以要恢復波邦族的王位，並非有所偏愛於波邦族的人。他覺得惟有這個方法，才可以保全歐洲的觕安。至於會議桌上那一般人的爭競貪狠，他却覺得無謂之極，他惟一的工作，是要保全歐洲的和平。歐洲的穩定富庶，就是英吉利的快樂滿足。</p>
<p>他静坐着，若有所思，可是他的思想，不在普魯士王的喧呶咆哮，亦不在麥泰湼的淸談娓娓。他所思念的，却在奥國國境之外，圍繞在法國巴黎皇宫中，坐在寳座上的一個肥碩，呆笨，而醉心自古相傳的王權思想之中的一個國君的左右，但他所想念的，却不是那路易十八世本人；在那愚而好自用的君主的旁邊却站着一個婦人，她是亭亭玉立的美婦人，那種儀態，曾經一度是法國朝庭中的模楷。這一個婦人，亦像她以前的多少婦人一樣，是想操縱了國王，而隱然做法蘭西的主宰的。（未完）</p>

<p>Meets with Important Guangdong Figures Before Visiting Li and Bai</p>
<p>Xiao Focheng Talks About His Dialogue with Doihara</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] After Doihara arrived in Guangzhou, he visited Chen Jitang, Lin Yunkai, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, and others. His whereabouts were extremely secret. At 8:30 on the morning of the 5th, Shi, accompanied by military officers Masuda and Usuda, took a civil aviation plane to Yong to visit Li and Bai, arriving at 2:00 in the afternoon. Xiao Focheng talked about Doihara's visit on the 4th. Shi first expressed his willingness to take on the responsibility of suppressing the communists in the Southwest. Then he talked about Sino-Japanese friendship. I replied that Sino-Japanese friendship is desired by us in principle, but it must be based on the Prime Minister's instructions, standing on independence and equality, and based on the true meaning of the people of the two countries. It must not be coerced by one party's military force to force the other party to be friendly with it. This can only be called conquest. In the past few years, Japan has been wrong to China, causing 400 million people to accumulate anger that cannot be appeased. In this situation, friendship is not easy to say.

<p>[Hong Kong] Luo Wengan received a telegram from Li Zongren inviting him to fly to Yong on the 4th. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Guangzhou] Doihara has been in the province for two days, discussing Sino-Japanese relations with various leaders, and has already taken a plane to Guilin this morning to visit Li and Bai in Nanning, and will come here again on the 8th. Doihara yesterday attended the welcome meeting of Mayor Liu Jiwen, and then met with Chen Jitang, Lin Yunkai, Xiao Focheng, and Zou Lu. In the evening, he hosted a banquet for the leaders of Japanese merchants in Guangzhou, explaining Japan's new policy towards China. The nature of the matters discussed between the Doihara and the Guangdong authorities has not been disclosed, but today Reuters reporters inquired with the Japanese authorities here to explore the rumors that Doihara had made important suggestions, hoping that the Southwest would be added to the scope of Sino-Japanese friendship. The Japanese authorities immediately denied it. Reuters reporters then visited Xiao Focheng, and thus learned about the situation of Doihara's talks with Xiao. Xiao said that Doihara earnestly stated that he did not bear military or political responsibilities for his trip to Guangdong, but only wanted to fulfill his long-cherished wish to visit the birthplace of the Chinese revolution. Doihara hopes that the two countries of China and Japan will continue to maintain friendly relations, and that the leaders of the Southwest will continue to work hard in the work of suppressing bandits. Doihara praised this work greatly. Xiao also said that the issue of Sino-Japanese friendship was discussed in general at the time. He told Doihara that Guangdong Province supports this move in principle, but this kind of cooperation plan must be based on mutual equality in accordance with Mr. Zhongshan's legacy. He also told Doihara that Japan's past mistakes in dealing with China by force must be corrected, because the friendly relations between the two countries cannot be built on the basis of one party's military force. Doihara expressed deep sympathy for what he said. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] An official from the Ministry of Finance said that the central government ordered local governments to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes. As for the subsidy funds promised to various places, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the financial supervisory committees of various provinces and cities to review the following situations: (1) The actual situation of those that have been abolished; (2) The proposed plan for those to be abolished; (3) How to offset the local funding; (4) Whether the central government has allocated tobacco and alcohol license taxes to offset; (5) The plan for offsetting after the stamp tax is allocated. Once a reply is received, it will be allocated immediately. If the provinces and cities are not doing their best to abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes, or if they require the central government to change the earmarked funds granted for other purposes, the central government will have to consider it and will not subsidize it.

<p>[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan recently explained the doubts about ownership registration as follows: (1) The registration authority stipulated in Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Enforcement Law of the Civil Code on Property Rights has not yet been established. People who are entitled to request registration as owners according to law should be deemed to be owners in accordance with Article 8 of the Enforcement Law on the date of entitlement to request registration due to the effect of the Enforcement Law. The ownership of the original owner will be eliminated at the same time. Therefore, in areas where the real estate registration system has been implemented, people who should be deemed to be owners according to law, even if they have not registered for ownership preservation, and have eliminated ownership, the original owner may not make any claims against them. As for whether people who are deemed to be owners can use their ownership to oppose third parties, in areas where the real estate registration system has been implemented, it is not possible to oppose them unless they have registered for preservation due to the provisions of Articles 3 and 5 of the Real Estate Registration Regulations. (2) People who are deemed to be owners, whose ownership is acquired based on the effect of the implementation of the law, should only be requested by the registration right holder for preservation registration.

<h3 id="e27">How to Promote China's Silk Industry <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Respectfully,</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of the silk industry by the China Silk Improvement Association: Internally, it focuses on "improving silkworm breeds," "restricting the methods of cocoon collection by various silk manufacturers," "regulating cocoon purchasing prices," and "regulating loan provisions for cocoon merchants." If these can be implemented, they will be of considerable assistance to the future of the silk industry. At the same time, standardizing the machinery of silk factories nationwide and improving raw silk will ensure that products tend toward uniformity. Externally, paying attention to the raw silk export market to ensure smooth sales is also a crucial point for the revival of the silk industry today. Its implementation should not be delayed.</p>
<p>The national economy of our country has always been based on the rural economy. In the past, the reason why our rural areas were relatively prosperous was that farmers could also profit from their side businesses in addition to farming and harvesting. The relatively wealthy areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan are all places where farmers' side businesses are developed, and among the farmers' side businesses, sericulture contributes significantly to supplementing farmers' income. Before the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), raw silk was the top item in our country's export trade. Therefore, if the silk industry suffers a setback, not only will farmers suffer, but cities will also be directly and indirectly affected. Now, the China Silk Improvement Association is focusing on guiding the improvement of silkworm breeds for the improvement of cocoons, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to rural revitalization. However, supplementary improvements to silk factory machinery are only allocated 135,240 yuan, which, when distributed to factories across the country, may still be insufficient.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of our country's silk factories are currently in dire straits. The reason for this is actually the sluggish sales of products and the sharp decline in silk prices. The reason for this is also partly due to the lack of attention paid by silk factory owners to the sales of raw silk. Therefore, the way to remedy this is: first, to investigate market conditions and accurately understand the actual situation of the raw silk market in countries that need raw silk, such as the United States. Furthermore, we must do our best to develop the inherent strengths of Chinese silk and strive to eliminate its shortcomings, so that products meet the needs of the market. The products of Japanese silk factories and their position in the American market must also be carefully examined for reference. Second, it is necessary to ensure that all factories cooperate effectively and that the quality of products meets the standards set by the needs of the market. By leveraging the power of government control to unify the steps taken by merchants in their operations, there may be hope for a turnaround in the future of the silk industry.</p>
<p>In addition, the future of the raw silk market must also be considered. Since the rise of artificial silk, raw silk has been greatly impacted. If countermeasures are not prepared in advance, it will be difficult to be optimistic about the future of the silk industry. The domestic market also requires significant investigation and research. Regardless of gender, Chinese people have always favored silk fabrics. However, our country's silk fabrics have gradually lost their strength and durability, and their speed in keeping up with trends lags behind. The raw materials for high-quality clothing for Chinese people have therefore been encroached upon by foreign goods. If active improvements can be made in the future, domestic consumers will naturally not be drawn to imported goods, and the foundation of the silk industry in the domestic market can be gradually consolidated.</p>
<h3 id="e28">British Government's White Paper Provokes German Outrage <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Hitler Suddenly Claims Illness</p>
<p>Requests Postponement of Negotiations</p>
<p>[Berlin] British Foreign Secretary Simon was originally scheduled to fly to Berlin on Thursday and return to London on March 10, but now his trip has been postponed because German leader Hitler has requested a temporary postponement of the visit to Germany. According to official sources, Hitler caught a cold while traveling in the Saar region and felt slightly unwell.</p>
<p>The talks between Simon and Hitler and other members of the German government will be postponed for a few days, but the specific time has not been indicated. Political circles do not want to express any criticism regarding the postponement, only saying that the leader is currently suffering from a slight cold. Just as the news of Hitler's cold and Simon's postponement of his visit to Germany was announced, all the evening newspapers in Berlin published editorials criticizing the British white paper on national defense, calling it an unfriendly document. The Angriff newspaper, a well-known National Socialist Party organ, said that on the eve of Simon's visit to Germany for negotiations, Britain actually published such a document, its intention clearly being to intimidate Germany. This is an old diplomatic trick that has not been effective. The Königsberg Daily News called the white paper a painful and startling event, a sentiment shared by all of Germany. German newspapers detailed Hitler's condition in large headlines, which is a first since the National Socialist Party came to power. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] This morning, the government issued a British national defense declaration, in which the army budget increased by approximately 4 million pounds compared to the previous session, and the number of personnel increased by 2,200. The announcement of this matter before Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany is akin to a warning. Political figures believe that Germany will be able to understand this warning, and that Britain is working tirelessly on international reconciliation, without retreating slightly due to Germany's unsupervised rearmament. This point should also be understood by Germany. In addition, the measures adopted by Britain are defensive in nature, but it has not abandoned its advocacy of an international collective security system, and is still striving for its victory. This sentiment is expressed in the declaration and leaves no room for doubt. Furthermore, the declaration is not only of great significance internationally, but will also cause a stir domestically. The opposition Labor Party will fiercely attack the increase in army expenditures, and the government will preemptively refute the opposition's criticism, while vigorously defending the policies adopted by the cabinet, as a preemptive measure. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government, on the one hand, announced that leader Hitler was ill and requested that British Foreign Secretary Simon postpone his visit to Germany, and on the other hand, issued a public statement to explain, saying that leader Hitler is currently suffering from a cold and is resting indoors, avoiding the wind. Until now, no one outside has heard of leader Hitler's cold. According to the news published by the "National Socialist Party Communications," leader Hitler personally went to the automobile exhibition yesterday for a final visit, which shows that the claim of a cold is sudden. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] Official sources have confirmed that when Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Berlin on the 7th of this month, he will be accompanied by Lord Privy Seal Eden. It is also said that the Berlin talks are purely exploratory in nature and that there is no question of concluding an agreement or pre-establishing a basis for compromise. This morning, the cabinet held a small group meeting and, in principle, expressed its approval of sending a cabinet member to Moscow. However, the official decision will probably be announced after Simon and Eden return from Berlin early next week. As for whether the so-called cabinet member refers to Simon or Eden, the cabinet has not yet decided, but it is likely to be Eden. It is said that the British government deeply desires to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and to establish mutual trust with it, equal to its friendship with France and Russia. This can be clearly seen from the fact that a British cabinet member will be going to Moscow (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] A British cabinet member will soon go to Moscow to consult with the Soviet Union. Conservative Member of Parliament Davidson recently raised a question in the House of Commons, asking whether the government intends to hold political talks with the Soviet Union before the cabinet member goes to Russia, so as to resolve the outstanding commercial issues between the two countries. Foreign Secretary Simon replied, "The government has not considered such talks." It is said that Britain and Russia previously signed a temporary commercial agreement, which Conservative MPs believe is insufficient. Therefore, Davidson raised the above question.

<p>Budget Increases Sharply, Total Strength Expected to Reach 100.5 Squadrons</p>
<p>Far East Route Planned to Extend to Hong Kong via Australia and Siam</p>
<p>[London] The British Air Force budget estimates stipulate that the British Air Force will increase by 40.5 squadrons by the end of 1938. From this, it can be seen that Britain is determined to expand its air force strength to be equal to that of the French Air Force. The Air Force budget totals 23,811,000 pounds, an increase of 3,685,000 pounds compared to 1934, including the additional funding approved by Parliament last summer of 200,000 pounds for the Air Force and 150,000 pounds for the Navy to purchase aircraft. The four-year plan set by the government will give Britain a total of 1,330 aircraft in the first line of defense. In addition, there are 130 aircraft incorporated into non-standby squadrons. It is planned to add eleven new squadrons to the National Defense Air Force, reaching a total of 54 squadrons, of which 41 squadrons are regular squadrons and the rest are auxiliary squadrons. The number of naval aircraft will also increase greatly. Including naval aircraft, the total strength of the British Air Force will increase to 100.5 squadrons. A memorandum on this matter stated that it is hoped that the air route from Australia to Bangkok will soon be extended to Hong Kong, and preparations have begun. The Hong Kong government has agreed to donate part of the funding. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">France and the United States Express Sympathy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[London] The British national defense white paper explained that Britain could no longer safely delay expanding its naval, land, and air forces, and France and the United States have responded to it sympathetically today. Responsible parties in Paris believe that the publication of this article by Britain at this time has two meanings: (1) British Foreign Secretary Simon is about to visit Berlin; (2) It is in line with France's steps, knowing that French Prime Minister Flandin will propose a two-year military service bill. US authorities also expressed sympathetic attention to this white paper. The budgets of the US Army and Navy have been fully approved and increased by Congress. Although there is no formal criticism yet, US official circles clearly acknowledge that the current situation in Europe provides a reason for Britain to increase its national defense strength. Berlin and Rome have not yet issued comments. German official circles are temporarily not expressing opinions, and German newspapers have not mentioned the white paper. Reuters' Rome correspondent learned that the Italian government is currently not prepared to make any statement on this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">German Public Opinion is Agitated <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers published and criticized the British white paper. The National Socialist Party's organ said that Britain is using the self-defense plans of disarmed countries as an excuse to greatly increase its military preparations. What is particularly noteworthy in the white paper is that it repeatedly mentions Germany and its military spirit, while not saying a word about Russia, which is vigorously proceeding with rearmament. At a time when the British Foreign Secretary is about to visit Germany, Germany is striving to avoid events that could cause difficulties because important negotiations are about to begin, while Britain seems to want to consolidate its position before the negotiations begin. The Essen National Daily News, which has close ties with Prime Minister Goering, said that the British white paper implies that the Rhine is the British border, which shows that Britain wants to regard Germany as its natural enemy. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">British Newspapers Offer Mixed Praise and Criticism <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[London] British newspapers today are all criticizing the government's white paper on national defense, with mixed praise and criticism. According to the opinion of political visitors, the government intends to have a five-year plan to renovate the navy, army, and greatly increase the air force, and the national defense expenditure will increase by approximately 60 million pounds. Lord Snowden criticized this article, saying that it was the biggest tragedy since the European War. When he first saw it, he suspected that it was drafted by the French Foreign Ministry. We are actually implicitly treating Germany as an enemy. Britain's obedience to France has already led to one war, and now it will lead us into another war. The Huibao newspaper stated that the Labor Party will file an impeachment motion against the government because of this matter. It is feared that Germany will not welcome Simon after the white paper is published, and Simon's mission to Germany will also fail. The Times published a long article, defending the government with great effort. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Three Reasons for Strengthening National Defense <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[London] The declaration submitted to the newspapers today by the British government is an important document on the defense policy of Britain and the British Empire. The declaration first states the motives for British defense policy, divided into three items:</p>
<p>(1) Britain has repeatedly devoted itself to the cause of peace, such as supporting the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Washington Treaty, the Locarno Treaty, and the Anglo-French London Agreement of February 3. Britain has not failed to support and participate in all of these. However, to think that various treaties alone are sufficient to guarantee peace is still premature, because the current international peace system has insufficient effectiveness in protecting countries from aggression. (2) Currently, countries are competing to increase their military preparations, especially Germany. If Germany's rearmament continues in its current state, it will inevitably be more difficult for Germany's neighbors to rest easy, and there is a risk of peace being threatened. (3) The protection of Britain's defense organization and the communication routes of the Empire has not been sufficiently strengthened. Protecting the maritime communications of the British Empire in wartime, preventing the lack of domestic supplies, and protecting the British people from aerial attacks are currently insufficient.</p>
<p>Based on the above three reasons, the British government believes that it is necessary to find ways to strengthen the defense of Britain and the British Empire. The declaration lists the scope of defense needs and the general procedures for increasing defense, divided into the navy, army, and air force, as summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Navy</p>
<p>Battleships have always occupied a major position in the British naval strategy. Britain's current battleships are very old and new ships should be built and replaced in a very short period of time. The various naval bases of the British Empire must be developed and their defenses increased.</p>
<p>(2) Army</p>
<p>It is advocated to increase funding so that the army's air defense equipment can be greatly expanded. All army equipment should be greatly renovated to modernize it.</p>
<p>(3) Air Force</p>
<p>The progress of aviation technology has made the British coast threatened by air force attacks. Therefore, from the perspective of air defense, the territorial integrity of certain territories outside the English Channel is more important to British security now than it was in the past.

<p>[London] This morning, the government issued a declaration explaining the reasons for increasing army expenditures and the number of troops. Lansbury, the leader of the Labor Party opposition in the House of Commons, declared, "This document is alarming and somewhat exaggerated." The Labor Party will criticize it once the House discusses this matter. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] Today in the House of Commons, the Labor Party opposed the government's white paper on national defense, published in the name of a nationally united government. Opposition leader Lansbury asked the government to pay attention to this, saying that this white paper was an unusual and alarming document. He only knew the name "British Government" and had never heard of any mention in official documents of the current government being a Labor, Conservative, or Liberal Party government. The Liberal Party's Samuel also declared his agreement with this protest. Prime Minister MacDonald then admitted that this was not a normal practice and that he would pay attention to it.

<p>Minister Shih Has Lengthy Talk with Phillips</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shih Chao-chi met with State Department officials today to discuss the possibility of international loans to China and the US government's silver policy. People here attach great importance to this meeting, but the content of the talks has not been released. Today, Deputy Secretary of State Phillips told the press that Ambassador Shih has been in contact with the State Department recently regarding the US government's silver purchase program, but there have been no developments recently. It is widely believed that ways to alleviate China's financial difficulties, including the possibility of loans, are currently under sympathetic consideration. Phillips also had a brief talk with Japanese Ambassador Saito today, stating that the United States is willing to inform Japan of any progress in diplomatic negotiations related to China with other countries. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned from reliable sources this morning that the US government is preparing to carefully consider the British proposal for international consultations to aid China. Observers now believe that the government will probably support any plan that does not cause international infighting and that can prevent Japan from issuing large loans at this time to consolidate its position in China. The British proposal advocates that France, Japan, the United States, and Britain cooperate to aid China. According to those close to the State Department, the government is prepared to support the British plan, but some feel that the plan suggests that Britain and the United States jointly provide loan funds to China while excluding France. (Guomin dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shih Chao-chi met with State Department authorities. After the release of this news, it has aroused various speculations that the international aid to China plan proposed by Britain may include some joint steps regarding international silver prices and supply. However, official circles are unwilling to confirm these speculations, and say that there are currently no new developments. As for Britain's attitude towards China, it is actually in line with US policy, that is, a joint movement of countries related to China, rather than seeking to obtain special benefits through separate competition. Official circles refused to discuss the British proposal, but expressed their willingness to welcome Britain's first proposal of this, as this move re-establishes Britain's attitude, which is still to maintain stability in the Far East. Some observers here believe that joint action may still be carried out by the four-nation consortium of Britain, Japan, France, and the United States in the past. Senior officials believe that the interests of Britain plus the interests of Japan and the United States may create a policy of common interest that is broader in scope than in the past. It is learned that official circles completely deny the saying that Britain and the United States are jointly disrupting Japan, as Britain's aid to China proposal has widely sought opinions from all parties and has invited Japan to participate. Therefore, it is believed here that it is actually a broad plan that has been agreed to by the United States. (Guomin dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Explains the Progress of Anglo-American Talks</p>
<p>[Washington] Deputy Secretary of State Phillips met with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito today, apparently wanting to avoid a US-Japan conflict due to the financial aid to China matter. Phillips detailed to Saito the progress of the United States' discussions with China and other countries on financial aid to China. After the talks, Saito said that he felt that the United States wanted him to be fully aware of the current situation, and that there should be mutual understanding in the future. He denied having discussed loans to China or silver issues with Phillips. Phillips told the press that he had also notified Ambassador Saito of the progress of the Anglo-American discussions on the China issue. Diplomatic circles said that the talks initiated by Britain are currently only general principles, not a certain loan issue or a certain special silver action. (Guomin dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is heard that Deputy Secretary of State Phillips recently made a guarantee to Japanese Ambassador Saito, saying that if the United States conducts talks with other countries regarding the China issue, it must notify Japan of the detailed situation. The British government yesterday proposed to the governments of the United States, Japan, and France that they jointly consider the possibility of providing financial assistance to China. Deputy Secretary of State's guarantee to the Japanese ambassador is in fact in agreement with the British government's move to discuss the matter with the United States, Japan, and France.

<p>Britain Emphasizes Commercial Interests</p>
<p>[London] British Lord Privy Seal Eden stated in the House of Commons today that Britain will continue to closely monitor the situation in China, and will pay attention to various British commercial interests. Members asked questions because they heard that the Chinese government wanted to increase import taxes on wool and other textiles, the result of which would have a significant impact on Lancashire, England. Eden made this statement in response. Eden also said that he has not yet received reliable information about this matter, but British representatives in China have already taken the opportunity to ask the Chinese authorities to pay attention to the increase in the tariffs on certain goods. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] London newspapers mostly discussed the possibility of international loans to China this morning. Although well-informed sources claimed that there was no progress other than inquiring about opinions, the financial community expressed great attention to this matter. The current weakness of the pound is not conducive to this kind of loan. Some people also said that if loans to China are approved, it will raise questions, as there are many problems near our country. Japan's attitude towards other countries' loans to China is also being studied very carefully. There are clearly two arguments in Japan regarding the China issue. Foreign Minister Hirota's recent conciliatory remarks were welcomed by London. However, official news about Japan's views on China, published in Japanese newspapers, is of a rather stern nature, and officials have not denied it to this day, which cannot be ignored. Londoners predict that the true meaning of Japan's Monroe Doctrine towards China will be revealed in the coming weeks. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e38">Roosevelt Advocates Direct Subsidies for the Shipping Industry <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Abolish the Existing System of Mail Delivery Contracts</p>
<p>Commercial Use in Peacetime, Assistance to the Navy in Wartime</p>
<p>Message to Congress Lists Three Major Reasons</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, advocating that the government maintain a sufficient merchant fleet with direct subsidies and abolish the existing system of mail delivery contracts for foreign mail. President Roosevelt said that the United States currently pays 30 million yuan for mail delivery contracts, but the actual price is only 3 million yuan based on ordinary freight rates, so the difference of 27 million yuan is simply a subsidy. President Roosevelt listed three major reasons, asking Congress to accept his proposal: (1) Peacetime shipping subsidies and other restrictions or rebate measures given by other countries can be used to destroy American shipping merchants. Even for the sake of maintaining fair competition, American merchant ships must have sufficient tonnage to properly operate American foreign trade. (2) When there is a war in other countries that does not involve the United States, American commerce will be greatly affected if it does not have sufficient merchant ships, because it will fail to find ships to operate neutral and peaceful foreign trade. (3) When there is a war involving the United States, American merchant ships are especially needed, not only for use as auxiliary naval vessels, but also for maintaining necessary commerce with other countries. President Roosevelt also said that American merchant ships have always been very important, but recently their value and importance have declined. But today has reached a period of rectification. All countries are now building new-style merchant ships. The American people want the American government to participate in this competition, and want the United States to use its own ships. Therefore, the government's responsibility lies in investigating whether the American merchant ships meet the people's hopes and national needs. Former disguised subsidies, such as mail delivery contracts and shipbuilding loans, have all failed. Therefore, direct subsidies are advocated, based on the difference between the cost of shipbuilding and operations in the United States and other countries, and the amount of many foreign subsidies for shipping operations. As for the number of subsidies, President Roosevelt did not specify, wanting Congress to decide on a number sufficient to offset the above-mentioned difference. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Los Angeles  In recent weeks, Army test pilots will fly new armed attack aircraft for final testing. This move may revolutionize air combat tactics. Under the command of Captain Ross, pilots will fly 30 steel-winged aircraft from the Northrop Aircraft Company. If the test flight achieves the expected results, the Army will obtain the most powerful new weapons and build another 30 aircraft. The construction method of these armed aerial machines is extremely secret, but it is said that they are single-wing aircraft made of pure steel, which cannot be destroyed by ordinary machine guns. These new aircraft are not intended to fight enemy aircraft in high altitude, but will fly close to the ground and strafe infantry because their armor cannot be penetrated by enemy bullets. Each aircraft is equipped with six machine guns and hundreds of pounds of bombs. The designers of the new aircraft claim that they will definitely be able to defeat the existing types of pursuit aircraft. The speed of the new aircraft is 250 miles per hour.

<p>Can Store Sixteen Bombs and Carry Two Cannons</p>
<p>Amsterdam  The T-5 bomber invented by the Dutch engineer Fokker can be called the world's largest air combat aircraft. The aircraft can be equipped with two 20mm rapid-fire cannons. Below the cannon, there is a rotating platform that can be moved in any direction, which is no different from two machine guns. The aircraft can store at least sixteen large bombs. Even with such a heavy load, it can still fly at a speed of 405 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 4,000 meters, because it is equipped with two 860-horsepower engines. If 650-horsepower engines are used instead, its speed will be reduced by 20 kilometers. There is also a new type of single-seat pursuit aircraft, designated "Type 19." It can be equipped with three machine guns and some bombs. Although its speed has not been announced, it is known that it can fly above other aircraft.

<p>Rumor that General Parlos Secretly Returned Home</p>
<p>Salonika The Minister of the Army, General Kondylis, recently used airplanes to scatter thousands of ultimatums to the rebels in eastern Macedonia, stating, "The government now limits you to surrender by noon today," and also stating, "Venizelos (the former Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party currently residing in Crete) incited you to betray the motherland out of personal impulsiveness and a love of power. If you still do not surrender by the deadline, the government has mobilized all its military forces and will use all its air force to suppress the rebels in eastern Macedonia. As for the responsibility for the war, it should still be borne by Venizelos." Kondylis also issued a declaration to the press, stating that "the government has absolutely no intention of restoring a dictatorship. The extraordinary measures currently being taken will be revoked as soon as the rebellion is suppressed. When the situation is calm, the government will immediately hold elections to elect new members of parliament." (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Athens After the government issued an ultimatum to the rebels, people generally believed that the rebels in eastern Macedonia would not be able to resist the government forces and would surrender to the government without a fight, because the total number of rebels was only 2,500. A large number of government troops have now begun to suppress them, and the rebels will not be able to resist stubbornly. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Athens The momentum of the rebels has not yet weakened. The government has ordered the conscription of reservists from the 1932 and 1933 classes. People are enthusiastically enlisting. Recruitment offices are often surrounded by hundreds of young people. President Zaimes has ordered the rebels to abide by the law to avoid national tragedy. Last night, the government sent infantry, artillery, warships, and airplanes to quell the rebellion in Macedonia, Crete, and the Aegean Sea. Last night, it was rumored that the governor of Crete, Apatskipti, and the former governor had been killed for plotting to resist the rebels. The loyal troops in eastern Macedonia, who are now advancing towards Thessaloniki's Drama, have come into contact with the rebels. Airplanes are traveling between Athens and Crete, constantly bombing the rebels' bases and fleets. According to witnesses, one bomb landed directly on the cruiser Averoff, and the other three rebel ships were also damaged. One account said that 25 people on the Averoff were shot dead for refusing to continue resisting the government and their bodies were thrown into the sea. Another account said that a rebel ship was seen on fire between Milos and Crete. This morning, the government announced that the national army had surrounded the rebels in Serres, Macedonia, and Drama, and the situation on Crete was gradually favoring the government. All traffic between Athens and Crete has been cut off, but it is reported that the rebels on the island are preparing to retreat to Rhodes. Prime Minister Tsaldaris declared that he believed the rebellion would be quelled soon. Tsaldaris also denounced former Prime Minister Venizelos, saying that he was only worthy of being called a bandit hero. Last night, news came from Cannes, France, that General Plastiras had secretly returned home. At the same time, martial law is still strictly enforced, and the authorities have ordered all wireless radios installed in homes to be removed. Military courts organized entirely by officers have now been established to try the rebels. All stock exchanges must wait until the situation is slightly calmed before they can reopen.

<p>Shizuoka News The recent sprouting of rice seeds from thousands of years ago, found inside a statue of Yakushi Nyorai (Medicine Buddha) in Japan, has caused a stir in academic circles. The details are as follows: Zensui Temple in Koka County, Shiga Prefecture, has a statue of Yakushi Nyorai with a tradition of thousands of years. Last year, at the end of the year, a crack suddenly appeared in the chest of the statue. The temple authorities invited a sculptor to repair it. Surprisingly, about one liter of rice seeds was found inside the chest of the statue. When the news spread, scholars across the country were greatly stirred and rushed to take some as research material. At the same time, the authorities of Nakaizumi Agricultural School in Shizuoka Prefecture also obtained twelve of the rice seeds for experiments. As a result, two of them were able to sprout. Japanese academic circles are amazed at the mystery of life, and it is particularly inconceivable that this object was obtained from inside a statue of the Medicine Buddha, whose great vow is to benefit all beings and satisfy their hunger.

<p>[Hankou] Yu Yuzhi, a member of the Hubei Disaster Relief Committee, said in an interview that there are 42 counties in the drought-stricken area last year, with more than 20 million disaster victims. Although the central government listed them as Grade A, no disaster relief funds were allocated. The province raised only one million yuan, which was used for relief, price stabilization, and agricultural relief, spending 250,000 yuan, 390,000 yuan for work relief, and 20,000 yuan for winter relief. The actual benefits to the disaster victims were few. Now, during the spring famine, grain is exhausted, and the situation is even more serious. It is hoped that the authorities will make every effort to raise funds to relieve the spring famine. (5th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Soviet Russia Actively Prepares for War in Outer Mongolia <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Kulun Town as the Center for Military Operations</p>
<p>And Constructing a Second Line of Defense</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch from the *North China Daily News*, February 22nd: A certain foreigner recently traveled in Mongolia and has now returned from Kulun to this place. He described the situation in Outer Mongolia, saying that the entire Outer Mongolia is currently preparing for war. This reveals the plan that Soviet Russia is currently implementing. Soviet Russia has recently begun to rapidly consolidate the defense of the entire Outer Mongolia. In the past, transportation relied entirely on camels, but now it is almost entirely replaced by automobiles. The vehicles are mostly loaded with military supplies. At the same time, all major roads and branch roads have been repaired and completed. The main road from Zhangjiakou to Kulun is particularly well-maintained. All places requiring bridges have been built, and the road surface is paved with stones, making it extremely strong. Heavy-duty vehicles can travel unimpeded. In the past, this road required constant repairs, but now it is passable year-round. Three gas stations have been built along the way to provide fuel for vehicles. One station even has a workshop and vehicle depot, storing many vehicles that can be deployed at any time, and is equipped with a wireless telegraph office. An airfield has also been built along the road for airplanes to land. At the stopping stations along the road, there are about fifty guards stationed. Kulun Town has become the center for military operations. From a general observation, Kulun already belongs to a border defense area. Everywhere one looks, one sees robust soldiers, with very few people in civilian clothes. About sixty kilometers away from Kulun, there is a complete arsenal connected by a first-class asphalt road. The factory produces a large number of bullets every day, and there is a workshop for repairing various weapons. All the personnel in the arsenal are engineers, gun experts, and skilled workers selected from major Soviet arsenals. The factory is equipped with wireless electricity. Four kilometers away from the arsenal, there is a small town where various troops are stationed. It is not known what kind of military supplies are stored in the town because ordinary people are not allowed to enter. On the other side of Kulun, about nine kilometers away from the town, there are two airfields, one for commercial use and one larger one specifically for military use. The airfield has aircraft storage, workshops, power plants, a wireless station, and barracks for staff and workers. Although Kulun is far from the border between China and Manchuria, one thing is strange: the residents of the town do not have a spirit of excitement, but are all fearful as if a great disaster is about to befall them. This is probably due to the fact that a part of the residents strongly hate Russia. The Russian-language *Harbin Daily* once published an article discussing the current situation in Mongolia, saying that the Soviet secret police are now making every effort to eliminate anti-Russian elements, either by deporting them, arresting them, or even executing those who do not support the Soviet system. Many lamas and Mongolians in Outer Mongolia have recently moved to the area bordering Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia. The road from Kulun to Doron Nor is one of the important roads for Mongolia, and now commercial traffic is prohibited and is used exclusively for military purposes and is very well maintained. Heavy-duty trucks carrying cement buckets are constantly driving in that direction. The authorities prohibit ordinary people from approaching the road, so it is impossible to know the specifics. Large quantities of military supplies, such as rifles, machine guns, and bullets, are transported along the road every day, and there are military escorts, sometimes accompanied by armored vehicles. Outer Mongolia has no defenses to rely on in the event of war, so Soviet Russia has built a strong line of defense in the Irkutsk province along the Transbaikal border, like a continuous chain. This is clearly to prepare a second line of defense in case the first line of defense is lost. From all these circumstances, it is sufficient to show that Soviet Russia is sparing no effort to consolidate border defenses and prepare for war.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Opening of the Hubei Provincial Administrative Conference <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Qun's Opening Speech Outlines Four Meanings</p>
<p>With Production and Construction as Central Issues</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In order to reform the district office system in Hubei Province, universally carry out land declarations, select central construction work, determine methods for people to perform labor service, and implement the group management district system, the provincial government specifically convened a province-wide administrative conference on the first of this month. However, because the commissioners of each district were either far from the province or unable to arrive in time, it was changed to the fourth. At 9:00 a.m. that day, an enlarged party and government memorial week was first held in the provincial government, followed by the opening ceremony of the province-wide administrative conference. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, Civil Affairs Director Meng Guangpeng, Finance Director Jia Shiyi, Construction Director Li Fanyi, Education Director Cheng Qibao, Committee Members Lu Zhu, Fan Xiji, Wu Guozhen, Li Shucheng, and administrative commissioners of each district, Yu Dianshu, Li Huiwu, Liu Fu, Cheng Ruhai, Yang Enxi, Shi Yuling, Lei Xiaocen, Cheng Zerun, Luo Jingyou, etc., all attended. Zhang Xueliang, director of the Generalissimo's Headquarters, also attended. After Chairman Zhang Qun announced the opening of the conference, Zhang Xueliang delivered a speech. After the speech, the first general assembly was held. Zhang Qun delivered the opening speech, which stated: "Last year in March, senior administrative personnel from various provinces were summoned by Chairman Chiang to Nanchang for training. Before going to Nanchang, the commissioners of our province first gathered at the provincial government twice, discussing in detail matters that should be promoted and reformed in the localities. Although there has been considerable progress in governance over the past year, after examining the past and looking to the future, there are still things that have not been fully realized as expected and still need to be promoted. In the past year, matters such as the joint office of the provincial government, the abolition of bureaus and the establishment of sections in the county government, the improvement of the security team system, the unified collection and expenditure of security funds, and the implementation of the four major political agendas have all been major reforms in past governance. Now, according to orders, reforming the district office system, universally carrying out land declarations, selecting central construction work, determining methods for people to perform labor service, and implementing the regulations on group management districts are all important policies that need to be implemented urgently in the future. All of the above can be listed as three major issues. First, the issue of system reform. In terms of the administrative system, the reorganization of counties and districts is consistent, eliminating the long-standing malpractices of separation between superiors and subordinates, perfunctory compliance, and following old ways. In terms of the security system, there must be repeated training and repeated retirement, from a small-scale conscription system to a large-scale conscription system. Second, the issue of production and construction. Matters such as people performing labor service, selecting central construction work, and conscripting labor for construction, developing local production and land, must be designed and implemented to make them effective. Third, the issue of land consolidation. Matters such as land surveys and declarations must be implemented properly with reference to local conditions. All of these matters require gathering collective wisdom and jointly planning for implementation. This is the main purpose of convening the province-wide administrative conference. The above-mentioned issues actually contain four meanings: first, governance methods; second, governance personnel; third, cultivating the strength of the people; and fourth, utilizing land. The purpose of governance methods is how to promote laws and regulations. The purpose of governing people is to study how to be a person, how to use people, and how to be employed by people. The purpose of cultivating the strength of the people is to create new people suitable for the modern era, striving to make people make the best use of their talents. The purpose of utilizing land is to create fertile land rich in production, striving to make the land make the best use of its advantages. The above four meanings, whether they belong to the governing aspect of governance methods and governance personnel, or to the political aspect of the people and land, are all principles that should be paid attention to in the province's politics, and also the basis for discussion in this conference. Recently, the international situation is changing, and the military suppression of bandits is progressing. We who bear the responsibility of politics should take advantage of this opportunity to quickly make plans for revitalization. Chairman Chiang once quoted Guanzi's saying 'Teach the people strength through death, teach the people wealth through labor' to instruct us. Although the two sentences are simple, they are actually the most refined in our country's political philosophy, and also the most essential in today's political facilities. Only when we want to teach the people through labor, we must devote ourselves to the utmost. Only when we want to teach the people through death, we must not stop until death. This is what I hope to share with my colleagues." Then, the list of review committee members was announced. The first group was civil administration, convened by Meng Guangpeng; the second group was finance, convened by Jia Shiyi; the third group was education, convened by Cheng Qibao; the fourth group was construction and water conservancy, convened by Li Fanyi; and the fifth group was security, convened by Fan Xiji. On that day, five proposals were discussed: (1) Proposed by the chairman, a draft of detailed rules for the implementation of the method of establishing district offices in various counties; (2) Proposed by the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, a plan for implementing district offices in various counties and formulating methods for raising funds for district offices; (3) Proposed by the Fourth District Commissioner, whether the qualifications of incumbent district chiefs and district members can be appropriately relaxed when establishing district offices; (4) Proposed by the Sixth District Commissioner, how to raise funds for the re-surveying of Baojia households and the reorganization of various land tax registers in each county after the establishment of district offices; (5) Proposed by the Eleventh District Commissioner, to move the district offices of the first district attached to the county seat to other more important cities and towns to avoid being equal to superfluous branches. It was decided to submit the cases to the first and second groups for combined review. At this point, the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, the first and second groups held a review meeting, completed the review of the above five cases, signed their opinions, and prepared to submit them to the second general assembly for approval and implementation. The meeting period was tentatively set for five days. Each general assembly invited a party, government, or military leader to attend and provide guidance. In addition to Zhang Xueliang's guidance at the first general assembly on the first day to discuss civil administration cases, He Chengjun, director of the Pacification Headquarters, was invited to guide the discussion of financial reorganization cases at the second general assembly on the fifth. Ai Yuying, Wang Shaoyou, and Liu Minggao, standing committee members of the provincial party department, were invited to guide the discussion of production and construction cases at the third general assembly on the sixth. Wen Qun, director of the Generalissimo's Headquarters, was invited to guide the discussion of rural education cases at the fourth general assembly on the seventh. Shi Yancheng, president of the High Court, was invited to guide the discussion of security team reorganization cases at the fifth general assembly on the eighth. In the afternoon of that day, the general assembly was closed. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce Delegates Conference <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>More Than One Hundred Delegates from Seventy-Three Chambers of Commerce Attend</p>
<p>Each Delegate Reports on the Decline of Commerce</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The united organization of the Jiangxi provincial business community existed before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, called the Office. After the seventeenth year, it was changed to the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce. However, since then, bandit disasters have spread, traffic has been blocked, and many counties and towns have been occupied by bandits. Therefore, in the past seven years, the two convocations of the full delegates conference have not reached the legal quorum. Now that the bandits have been pacified, a provincial chamber of commerce conference was specifically held on the second. A total of 93 county and town chambers of commerce were selected as delegates. More than 100 delegates from 73 chambers of commerce attended. Representatives from the Pacification Headquarters, the provincial and municipal party departments, the provincial and municipal governments, the Nanchang Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations and groups all participated in the opening ceremony. The venue was set up at the Wanshou Palace Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At 10:00 a.m., the opening ceremony was held. Wang Jianwu, standing committee member of the Nanchang Municipal Chamber of Commerce, presided. After performing the ceremony, he reported on the reorganization of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, stating that since the reorganization of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce in the seventeenth year, due to bandit disasters, most local chambers of commerce were dissolved in name only, and no one was responsible. Last year, the provincial party department and the provincial government felt that it was necessary to urgently organize a united association of chambers of commerce in the province, so they appointed Wang Mingxuan and others as reorganization committee members. There were originally 155 chambers of commerce in various counties and towns. Because chambers of commerce in Dexing Yunmenling and other places did not have representatives attending, there were only 113 chambers of commerce. 93 chambers of commerce elected representatives, more than two-thirds. As of now, 73 chambers of commerce have reported their attendance, with 123 representatives. After the chairman's report, representatives from Yujiang, Wanzai, Yihuang, Jishui, Futian, Xinyu, Dayu, Yichun, and other places reported on the impact of the decline of local specialties on commerce. Then, representatives from the Pacification Headquarters and the provincial party department delivered speeches. Wang Jianwu gave a reply on behalf of the presidium. The ceremony was completed at 12:00 and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Many proposals were sent by chambers of commerce in various counties and cities, roughly divided into (1) 8 cases of blockade, (2) 3 cases of financial relief, (3) 1 case of textiles, (4) 1 case of the chamber of commerce's own organization, (5) 7 cases of industrial and commercial development, (6) 7 cases of transportation business, (7) 2 cases of commercial self-defense, (8) 7 cases of disaster relief, (9) 1 case of tungsten ore relief, (10) 2 cases of store rent, (11) 3 cases of commercial request for exemption from military service, (12) 9 cases of military service allocation borrowing and advance payment, (13) 11 cases of business tax, (14) 13 cases of post-bandit area donation, (15) 12 cases of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, (16) more than 10 other cases, and there are still cases regarding the improvement of local products in various places in order to develop commerce, but they have not been compiled. The conference is scheduled to begin discussing each proposal and elect committee members on the fourth. After the closing of the meeting, they will visit various experimental areas. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Guangdong Provincial Finance Department Investigates Taxes in Various Regions <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Investigation Teams to Go to Various Counties</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The number of taxes in Guangdong Province is as numerous as the hairs of an ox, and it is impossible to count them all. Even the Finance Department feels that it does not know the total number. Therefore, the department has an organization of tax investigation teams, which go to various counties to investigate. From last year to the present, the investigation has not yet been completed. The head of the investigation team, Zhang Zimo, recently arrived in Shantou from the province on the Haiheng wheel. The members of his team are Feng Guangren, Lin Shaohan, Yao Shijin, Chen Chengtian, Liao Xiang, etc. Zhang Zimo said that the areas to be investigated this time are Shantou, Chaoan, Jieyang, Puning, Chaoyang, Chenghai, Raoping, and Nanao. The investigation matters can be divided into seven points: (1) The types and actual amounts of income of the county and city governments and their affiliated agencies, groups, and district and township offices; (2) The types, actual amounts, and uses of expenditures of county agencies and local groups; (3) All items of taxes and donations collected or paid in each county, city, district, and township, including the name, tax rate, use, actual amount of income, collecting agency, whether it has been submitted to the competent authority for approval, entrusted or contracted, or public bidding, and the people's ability to bear the tax; (4) The names, tax rates, collection methods, uses, and annual total amounts of taxes and fees collected by people's organizations in various counties and cities, such as party departments at all levels, councils, education associations, chambers of commerce, labor unions, schools at all levels, hospitals, charitable halls, orphanages, and other charitable organizations, and which agency approved them; (5) Situation of receiving fees; (6) People's economic situation and ability to bear; (7) Whether the agencies and companies entrusted or contracted by the national and provincial taxes and the municipal and county governments to collect taxes are harsh and the situation. The above seven items are the outline of the investigation given by Zhang Zimo. However, it is impossible to predict the results of the investigation, because the number of taxes in Chaozhou and Meizhou is countless. There are things that are taxed more than ten times, and there are things that must pay donations when passing through the border. There are also donations for conscripts, women's marriage donations, dowry donations, temple wish donations, vegetarian donations, vegetarian donations, repentance donations, paper money donations, incense candle donations, superstition donations, and lamp oil donations. The names are established separately, and taxes are everywhere, so the people are all groaning under the weak government.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Fuzhou Commerce Can Be Expected to Turn Around <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Local Products from Northern Fujian Will Be Transported to the Province in Large Quantities for Market</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: There are two commercial ports in Fujian: Xiamen in southern Fujian and Fuzhou in northern Fujian. Because the four items of wood, tea, paper, and bamboo shoots produced in northern Fujian are all exported through Fuzhou and transferred to domestic and foreign countries, and most of the foreign goods, seafood, silk, and fabrics imported by Fuzhou are also sold in northern Fujian. In recent years, due to the disturbance of the Red Bandits in northern Fujian, the local area was in chaos, people fled, and the production of various products was completely cut off. The purchasing power of the people was also greatly reduced. Fuzhou's commerce was affected by this and fell into extreme decline. The wood, tea, paper, and bamboo shoot firms could not make any profit and stopped business one after another. The silk and fabric shops were unable to bear the losses and went bankrupt, resulting in one-third of the loans issued by money shops being unrecoverable, with no hope of principal or interest. The money shops then uniformly withdrew the bills and stopped issuing notes, and the business community became even more stagnant due to tight credit. The precarious situation seemed to be unsustainable. Fortunately, since the summer of last year, the Red Bandits in northern Fujian have been defeated by the National Army, and various counties have been recovered one after another. The refugees who fled to other places were sent back to their hometowns in batches by the government. On the one hand, the rural financial relief office set up in the province organized cooperative societies in the villages and towns of the bandit-affected counties and lent money to farmers, allowing them to engage in planting and farming. After half a year of pacification, local order has gradually stabilized, and the rural economy has also become slightly active. Therefore, since the winter of last year, cloth, oil, and other goods transported from Fuzhou to northern Fujian have gradually become popular. Since the beginning of this year, the amount of paper and bamboo shoots transported from northern Fujian to Fuzhou has also increased. Now, in order to resume business, the tea and wood firms have decided to send partners to the mountains of northern Fujian with money to place orders, so that they can be transported to the province in large quantities for the market in the late spring and early summer. However, this capital must be borrowed from the money shops to be active. Therefore, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce advised the money shops to uniformly open the market on the twelfth day of the second lunar month, the birthday of the Earth God, and issue notes and lend money as usual, so that commerce can circulate and business can develop. Therefore, it is expected that the Fuzhou business community can be expected to turn around this year. However, Wang Meihui, a prominent merchant in the city and standing committee member of the county chamber of commerce, who opened Tongcheng Porcelain Shop, Hengji Customs Brokerage, and Chang'an Shipping Company (i.e., Chang'an Steamer), suddenly went aground recently, owing a debt of 1.3 million yuan, which caused a great shock to the business community. The reason for this is that Wang has been operating flour in Shanghai for the past two years, losing more than one million yuan, which led to poor turnover. Among them, the Henghe Money Shop opened by Luo Mianhou, chairman of the county chamber of commerce committee, was owed the most, about 300,000 yuan. Now Luo and others are coming out to maintain it, so that it can continue to operate to avoid affecting the market. In addition, the price of rice has risen from 8 yuan to 12 yuan per stone in less than a month because the customs levies full tax on the import of foreign rice, and grain merchants take the opportunity to manipulate prices, which has greatly affected people's food. The Chamber of Commerce is also scheduled to hold a meeting today (2nd) to discuss restrictions. The first step is to prevent further increases, and then persuade rice merchants to expand their sources to match supply and demand for mediation. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e82">The New Regulations on House Tax in Jiangsu Province and the Appeal of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Farmers and Businesses Are Struggling, and Local Areas Can Hardly Bear Additional Burdens</p>
<p>House Taxes in Various Counties Should Remain as They Were</p>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to implement the collection of house tax from residents starting March 1st, and to increase the tax on storefront properties to 15%. Orders have been issued to various counties to actively implement this. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce believes that these new house tax regulations have not gone through legal procedures and violate the Central Government's resolutions. Yesterday, they sent telegrams to various ministries and departments of the Central Government, as well as the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Tax Supervision Committee, requesting a halt to the implementation. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The house tax in Jiangsu Province originated in the late Qing Dynasty and was originally a revenue-generating measure. Therefore, it was based on a percentage of the rent. Wuxi currently collects 10% of the monthly rent, but only on storefronts and not on residential properties. This is because housing is essential for people's lives. Residential properties are different from storefronts, and the interior of the country is different from metropolitan areas. Where supply exceeds demand, more revenue can be generated. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Outline of National Reconstruction, the government should work with the people to plan and build various types of houses for the people's residence. How can people's housing be subjected to extortion? This is not in line with the Party and the State's emphasis on people's livelihood. However, we recently saw reports stating that Jiangsu Province has passed regulations on house taxes for all counties, regardless of whether the houses are self-owned or rented, storefronts or residences, in both urban and rural areas. Rented houses will be taxed at 8% of the monthly rent, storefronts at 15%. Self-owned houses will be taxed at 0.8 per thousand of the assessed value for residences and 1.5 per thousand for storefronts. It is also stipulated that this will be implemented immediately. Taxing residential properties will inevitably cause disturbance, and increasing the tax on storefronts by half is clearly an increase in burden.</p>
<p>We respectfully note that the Central Government convened the Second National Financial Conference in May of last year, deeply aware of the deteriorating social economy, the inability of farmers to support themselves, and the increasing decline of industry and commerce. Therefore, the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies was listed as an important agenda item. In his instructions, Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan repeatedly emphasized the severe impoverishment of rural areas, the extreme poverty of society, and the need for relief for the people. He said that he could not bear to levy taxes and extract the people's lifeblood, and almost shed tears. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi stated in his opening remarks that there were many tasks in planning for recovery, and that the urgency and importance should be carefully considered. Regarding local defense, transportation, education and other policies, he said that efforts should be made to utilize the capabilities of self-governance and self-defense to reduce expenditure and tax burdens. The conference passed a resolution to establish tax supervision committees in all provinces and cities to oversee the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and issued a declaration, solemnly stating that in the future, any items of income that involve heavy burdens and disturbances to the people must be eliminated and rectified. If the excess can be removed first, the people's strength can be given a small respite. Any items of expenditure that are useless or not urgent must be abolished or delayed, and any that are excessive or wasteful must be reduced. Being able to reduce expenditure is no different from creating new sources of revenue, and being able to reduce fees eliminates the need to increase taxes. His words were profound and clear, showing the government's concern for the people's suffering and its great determination to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The local people were moved to tears.</p>
<p>Less than a year has passed, and the people are longing for timely rain, but Jiangsu Province is instead enacting new regulations to collect house tax, increasing the tax on storefronts by half and extending it to residential properties. Is this in line with the Central Government's efforts to abolish exorbitant taxes and reduce the people's burden? According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Central Government Supervision of Local Finance, when provinces and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan need to change tax items, increase or decrease tax rates, or raise public debt, they should, in accordance with the law, formulate a plan and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for review and signature, and then submit it to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and resolution, and then submit it to the National Government for approval. Article 4 states that counties and cities may not change tax items without legal basis. When there is a need to increase or decrease tax rates, or raise public debt, they should, in accordance with the law, formulate a plan and, before the establishment of the county and city councils, convene local legal entities for open discussion, and submit it to the Finance Department for review and signature, and then submit it to the Provincial Government for deliberation and approval, and then submit it to the Ministry of Finance for record. Article 7 states that local governments at all levels may not implement any changes to tax items, increases or decreases in tax rates, or raising public debt without approval in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this law, and may not include them in the budget. The regulations are very clear and strict. Now that the house tax in Jiangsu Province is for the expenses of various counties, even if the local areas really need to increase or decrease it, it seems that they should, in accordance with the law, listen to open discussions in the various counties. It is not appropriate to make a decision directly in the province, and before going through legal procedures, it should not be implemented in the province or the counties. This is clearly stipulated by law and should be strictly observed by officials and the people.</p>
<p>At a time when farmers and businesses are struggling and local areas can hardly bear additional burdens, the house tax in Jiangsu Province should remain as it was and should not be changed lightly, lest it cause more disturbances. If it is for the purpose of improving public security, officials and the people must work together. The Baojia system is currently being implemented, and various counties are actively promoting it. If it can gradually achieve results, it can reduce the need for security guards. Only by referring to the views of Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi at the Second National Financial Conference, utilizing the capabilities of self-governance and self-defense to reduce expenditure and tax burdens, and by the tax supervision committees of the various provinces and cities fulfilling their responsibilities to report illegal taxes in accordance with the powers conferred by the Central Government, can the problem be solved. This matter concerns changing taxes and increasing the burden on the people. As a local organization, our Chamber is well aware of the people's difficulties. We dare not speak lightly, but we cannot bear not to speak out. Therefore, we dare not avoid severe punishment, and offer our earnest and direct opinions. We respectfully ask for your consideration and acceptance, and request that you immediately halt the implementation and order that the previous regulations be reinstated to avoid disturbances and uphold the rule of law. We await your orders with utmost eagerness. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

<p>Conclusion of the Debate on the Daytime Robbery Case</p>
<p>Last winter, when the county launched its winter defense campaign, the Rifeng Gold Store on Fengle Bridge inside the West Gate was suddenly robbed at 9 a.m. Gold bracelets were stolen and the deputy manager, Zhao Houzhuang, was shot and injured. The two robbers escaped over the city wall with the stolen goods. The local military and police authorities considered the daytime robbery to be extremely serious and launched a search and arrest operation. A robber named Zhao Zhiyi was apprehended in Chedun, and a handgun with the markings of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department was found. He was escorted to the county government for interrogation. According to Zhao Zhiyi's confession, he was instigated by bad friends to borrow money and was invited to commit the crime. He stole a gun from his father (who was a detective in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department) and came to Songjiang with his friend, staying at the Songhui Hotel. After obtaining the stolen goods, he handed them over to his bad friend, who fled with them, etc. Later, the county government telegraphed the province for instructions, and he was ordered to be handed over to the local court for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. After an investigation by the Prosecutor's Office, a public prosecution was filed. Judge Zhang of the Criminal Court held a trial today (5th), and the witness Zhao Houzhuang testified in court. Zhao Zhiyi's testimony was largely the same as before, but he suddenly changed his story regarding cutting the telephone line. The defendant hired lawyer Gu Shouyi to defend him in court. The judge declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>Completion of Aerial Survey</p>
<p>The aerial survey of Wuxi, which began in November of last year, has now been completed after three months. The total area of the county is 1,333 square kilometers, equivalent to 200,000 mu. The accuracy is very reliable. The total cost was 112,273.40 yuan, which has been reported to the provincial government. The reason why it was able to be completed so quickly in a short period of time is that it was time-saving and economical, and the accuracy is more reliable than manual surveying.</p>
<p>Tragic Scene of a Burnt Slum</p>
<p>The area near the Xicheng Road intersection in the county is where many Jiangbei immigrants gather, so the thatched huts are closely packed together, like a beehive. Yesterday (5th) morning at about 3 o'clock, a fire accidentally broke out in the house of Yao Fushun. The flames quickly spread and became uncontrollable, spreading to neighboring huts. The fire brigades of various sections heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene with water pumps, doing their best to put out the fire. As a result, 36 thatched huts were burned down. When the fire was raging, the wife of Wu Fugen, Zhou, who lived in a neighboring hut, was burned on her right hand because she was slow to escape. The cries of men, women, and children were unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Bureau Chief and Staff Dismissed and Investigated</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Opium Committee previously received a secret report stating that Zhang Yu, the chief of the First Branch Bureau of Wuxi, and Fan Shouchi, a staff member, were involved in bribery in the case of the wanted large opium dealer Wang Guiqing. Therefore, on the 12th of last month, they sent investigator Li Gongfu to Wuxi to thoroughly investigate. However, after Li arrived at the First Branch Bureau, Zhang Yu and Fan Shouchi openly insulted the Provincial Committee. After Chen, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, learned of this, he recorded a demerit against Zhang and Fan for being rash in handling the matter. Yesterday, the county government received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs, stating that Zhang Yu, the chief of the Public Security Branch Bureau of the county, and Fan Shouchi, a staff member, had openly insulted the Provincial Committee and were extremely absurd. They were immediately dismissed from their posts and investigated in connection with the case. The vacant positions were to be filled by other committee members. It is said that because Magistrate Yan went to Shanghai to negotiate fundraising matters and had not yet returned to Wuxi, and Chief Chen Yuchu of the Public Security Bureau was also attending a public security conference in the provincial government, the successors to the positions in the Public Security Bureau have not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Investigation and Prohibition of Blasting to Quarry Stone</p>
<p>The roadbeds of the Suchang and Xichang highways have been completed, and bidding is now being invited to pave the macadam road surface. Unexpectedly, the contractors, greedy for petty profits, are quarrying stone at the foot of Xishan in the county, using a large amount of explosives every day to blast and chisel the stone. However, the area is a scenic area, with historical sites and tombs everywhere, many of which have been damaged. Local citizens have petitioned the county authorities to investigate and prohibit this. Recently, more than 300 people from other provinces have arrived in the Xiangxiang area of Xishan, bringing a large number of tools and gunpowder, preparing to extract a large amount of stone. The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing this, believes that privately quarrying stone is a violation of the prohibition regulations and has sent police to stop them.</p>

<p>Gangsters Send Threatening Letters to Villagers</p>
<p>The Yinsha area of Weicun in the northern Wu Yi township has always been a place where bandits appear. Last year, Liu Xingsu, a wealthy resident of the city, went to the countryside to collect rent in Yinsha and was kidnapped by bandits. His whereabouts are still unknown. Unexpectedly, Xu Xirong, a farmer in Qingshui Gou near Weicun, found a red letter on the ground when his daughter was opening the door the day before yesterday. She picked it up and told her father, Xirong, who, after opening it, realized that it was a threatening letter from gangsters. The letter demanded that a large sum of money be raised quickly and sent to the Dragon Emperor Temple for negotiation within three days. If the deadline was missed, they would gather their men and burn and kill the entire family. Xirong is now extremely uneasy, and the nearby residents are also panicked.</p>

<p>Completion of the Beigushan Meteorological Station</p>
<p>Since its expansion, the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Station has found that the original location and buildings were insufficient for its needs. A meteorological station was built on the central peak of Beigushan. Construction has been underway for several months, and the project has now been completed. The interior layout, such as the installation of instruments and the arrangement of miscellaneous items, has been completed. They are now engaged in organizing documents and will be able to move into the new station and begin working within days.</p>
<p>Most County Warehouses Completed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance previously ordered all counties to actively complete the construction of county warehouses. According to the survey, more than 40 counties, including Taixian and Dongtai, have been established and are ready for use. In January of this year, three new warehouses were built in Jurong, four in Wujin, two in Taixian, one in Shuyang, three additional warehouses were set up in Yixing, two each in Jintan and Rugao, and one each in Songjiang, Taixing, and Jiangdu. Seven of the ten provincial agricultural warehouses have now been completed. Only Suqian, Huaian, and Rugao are still under construction. In addition, the Department of Finance also plans to build three or four provincial warehouses in Jurong and other counties.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association Discuss and Determine Measures to Revitalize the Market <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Conducted separately by the two groups</p>
<p>Premier Wang Replied by Telegram and Instructed the Ministry and the Municipal Council to Discuss</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Appointed Representatives to Prepare for a Personal Presentation</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the issue of market relief, since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Silver and Money Guilds and other four groups have been working separately, the financial situation has gradually become more flexible and the market has stabilized. Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association, in order to seek further expansion, have each formed specialized committees to study specific methods of revitalization. After several discussions, five measures have been decided upon and will be earnestly implemented. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Specific Measures</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association have formally developed five specific measures to revitalize the market: (1) Bills of exchange from various industries should be discounted by silver and money businesses. If there is proper collateral, the silver and money businesses should accept them. The Central Bank should also provide rediscounting to silver and money businesses. (2) Title deeds and land license certificates should be added as collateral for Central Bank notes. (3) Title deeds and land license certificates should be added as savings collateral. (4) Silver and money businesses should continue to send account books to various stores as usual, but they may determine the amount of overdrafts granted. The stores themselves should also strive to improve their organization. (5) If silver and money businesses mortgage goods or real estate to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, or the Bank of Communications, or discount bills, they should accept them as much as possible. The above five measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the two groups, and letters have been sent to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Silver and Money Guilds, requesting compliance.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Replies to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>In addition to agreeing on five specific measures with the Local Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry on March 1, stating the difficulties faced by industry and commerce in Shanghai and requesting that fundamental plans be drawn up quickly. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, which read: "The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I have received your telegram. The government has long been considering ways to rescue Shanghai's stagnation. At this time, the world economy is generally tight, and Shanghai, as a major port in the East, can hardly be exempt. In addition, the national crisis is at its height and the countryside is in decline. Tracing the cause of these problems is complex and difficult. The government's policies in recent years have all focused on revitalization as an urgent matter. We cannot limit ourselves to temporary solutions, nor can we shirk our responsibilities. The profitability or loss of Shanghai's commerce is closely related to the prosperity of the entire country. The coordination of information has always been a matter of concern. The section in your telegram concerning the request for relief from twenty industries has been referred to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Government for immediate consultation on specific measures, which will be submitted for approval and implementation to provide relief. I hope that your Chamber of Commerce and all sectors will work together to discuss and cope calmly, so that the market can stabilize as soon as possible. I trust that the members of your Chamber of Commerce will understand the importance of cooperation. A special reply, Wang Zhaoming in winter."</p>
<p>Appointed Representatives to Present Personally</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided that, although measures to revitalize the market have already been discussed and are being implemented, there is still a need to present them to the government authorities in person. Therefore, at the ninth meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, and Bei Songsun were appointed as five advisory committee members, and Chairman Yu Zuoting and Supervisory Committee member Du Yuesheng were appointed to visit the government authorities when necessary.</p>

<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the text of the telegram sent by the Industrial and Commercial Relief Association to Chairman Chiang yesterday, as reported in the newspaper, was a draft. It has since been modified and sent. The original text is now published as follows: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, We have long admired your achievements in the Party and the State and your concern for the people. All of us in industry and commerce feel love and respect. However, in recent years, we have suffered from internal water and drought famines and external dumping from various countries. In addition, the number of silver exports last year was more than 400 million, and the number of trade deficits was 700 million, leading to economic decline and livelihood difficulties. Moreover, the financial and industrial sectors are still at odds, unable to help each other. Therefore, not only is the countryside on the verge of bankruptcy, but industry and commerce are also in danger. An investigation shows that four out of ten factories in Shanghai have closed down this year, and three out of ten stores have closed down. The number of unemployed workers that can be counted has reached more than 500,000. If we do not take remedial measures immediately, what prospects can we imagine for industry? In view of this, Zhihao and others established the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association in Shanghai on March 2 this year, with the primary purpose of rescuing industry. In addition to detailing the measures, which will be submitted by telegram for approval, we hereby report by telegram. The entire board of directors of the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, and the sub-district associations all kowtow."</p>

<p>Merchants Take the Opportunity to Purchase Foreign Goods at Low Prices</p>
<p>Creating Another Opportunity for Silver Exports</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the gold price situation has been plummeting recently, with new lows being created, reaching a record low of 805 yuan. The market is extremely uncertain. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited a prominent figure in the financial world to ask about the impact of the gold price decline on our society. The figure said that the gold price has fallen from more than 900 yuan to 806 yuan in the past month, a difference of more than 100 yuan. The reason is that countries that use gold want to depress the value of their currency so that their surplus goods can be sold widely in foreign markets. Large domestic accounts are also selling and buying aggressively, resulting in a sharp decline. This phenomenon will naturally have a great impact on our country's industry, commerce, and banks. As foreign currency prices fall, our merchants can take the opportunity to purchase foreign goods at low prices. In other words, this creates another opportunity for silver exports, which is all harmful and no beneficial to China.</p>

<p>Chen Chunpu, a Standing Committee Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department, who was dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an overseas inspector of consulates in Nanyang and to investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs, set sail from Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. on the Great Britain Corporation's *Chetolah*. The ship was docked at buoys 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River. Chen and his wife boarded the ship at 2:30 p.m. from the Xinguandock by the company's passenger launch. Liang Yugao, a Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zheng Lin, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and Shanghai factory leaders Wu Zhihao, Shen Xingyao, and Xiang Kangyuan all went to the dock to welcome them. Zheng Lin is scheduled to depart on the ninth with his secretary Su Hongbin, who is accompanying him on the inspection, on the French Post's *Athos II*.

<p>First Repaying Interest of 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Extending the Mortgage for One Year</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the HSBC's unauthorized sale of the Xinqi No. 7 Factory, after the Executive Yuan telegraphed the municipal government to send representatives to negotiate, and with enthusiastic support from all sectors, HSBC authorities have agreed to accept our requests under reasonable conditions. However, the final solution still awaits Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's arrival in Shanghai before a decision can be made. As for who the buyer actually is, after much investigation, although the representing lawyer is Japanese, it is still a smokescreen for the buyer. According to sources from the Japanese side, at a time when Sino-Japanese relations are relatively good, they are unwilling to cause resentment from various sectors in our country by purchasing Xinqi No. 7 Factory. Although purchasing Xinqi is profitable, Japanese businesses are not focused on this trivial matter. It is rumored that the buyer and HSBC authorities may have some tacit agreement, or that the auction may have had considerable conditions attached, stipulating that the auction could be cancelled within a certain period. This statement may also be close to the truth. As for Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Xinqi Textile Company, he is currently entrusting Mr. Pögler, the taipan of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, to negotiate with Mr. Hucker, the taipan of HSBC, requesting to first repay 160,000 yuan in interest, and for the remaining mortgage to be extended for one year. The other party has agreed to consider it. According to Mr. Rong, the Central Bank does not have a concrete solution before Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Municipal Government Requests Central Government to Restrict the Import of Foreign Rice <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Will Submit for Discussion at Next Meeting</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the drought last year caused poor harvests, rice merchants in various places have been purchasing foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, Xiaojiao, etc., for regulation. The number registered by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau totaled more than 6.2 million bags. However, after further investigation by dispatched personnel and reports from various foreign firms, the actual number exceeded the registered number. After detailed research by the bureau, a solution was drafted and submitted to the municipal government for approval. The municipal government believes that the influx of foreign rice has a significant impact on rural areas, and also considers the importance of the people's food supply. The solution proposed by the Social Affairs Bureau will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to information obtained by the Dagong News Agency, the solution includes: (1) Unregistered foreign rice should be ordered to be stopped from being imported by the customs. (2) For No. 3 foreign rice (also known as 60-grain broken rice), the Ministry of Finance should instruct customs offices in various places to increase import tariffs to restrict imports. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will submit this proposal for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Customs Office Studies Tax Increase Issue</p>
<p>In recent days, the rice market has been discussing the news of a tax increase on foreign rice. One theory is that it will be implemented next month, and another is that it must be passed by the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Finance to implement it according to the highest principle of the foreign rice import tax previously passed by the Legislative Yuan. A reporter from Dagong News Agency inquired yesterday at the Shanghai office of the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance. According to Secretary Wei, this matter concerns the national food supply, and whether to increase import taxes on foreign rice is still under careful study. Rumors of a scheduled implementation have not yet received official orders from the Ministry of Finance. However, information obtained by the reporter from other sources suggests that increasing taxes on foreign rice is a demand from all parties and is expected to be realized soon. The authorities, for administrative reasons, fear that prior announcements may cause obstacles, so they are unwilling to easily announce the date of implementation.</p>
<p>Permits Issued for Circulation in Fujian, Guangdong, and Other Provinces</p>
<p>Our country's southwestern provinces, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, except for Zhangzhou and other areas in southern Fujian that produce some rice, generally do not plant rice due to climate conditions and rely entirely on imports of foreign rice. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance will not impose taxes on the import and circulation of foreign rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. If ordering foreign rice from Saigon, a passport must first be obtained for circulation.</p>

He recently left the British diplomatic community to travel in China and has now arrived in Shanghai. When guests visit him, Mr. Payer asks that they not discuss politics and only describes Tibetan customs and folkways and the beautiful scenery of Lhasa. Mr. Payer lived in Tibet for a long time and returned to his country from Lhasa in 1921. He recently traveled there again for five months, and Tibetans allowed him to travel freely to any place. This kind of privilege is rarely granted to foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Legislative Committee Member Shi Weihuan Discusses Inspection of Various Exchanges <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Investigating Methods of Collecting Margin Money</p>
<p>Seeking Opinions on Curbing Yarn Merchant Monopoly</p>
<p>Inspecting the Work of Financial Supervision Commissioners</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Legislative Yuan has dispatched Legislative Committee members Chen Jianru and Shi Weihuan to Shanghai to investigate the situation of various exchanges in Shanghai, in order to revise the Exchange Law and deliberate on the Ministry of Finance's collection of exchange taxes. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Shi and Mr. Chen at their hotel and received the following information:</p>
<p>Reviewing Methods of Collecting Margin Money</p>
<p>According to them, they were dispatched to Shanghai to inspect various exchanges because the Legislative Yuan is about to revise the Exchange Law and deliberate on various matters such as the Ministry of Finance's collection of exchange taxes. Therefore, upon arriving in Shanghai, they visited various exchanges one after another and have now completed their mission. The goal is to address the issue of margin money collection, believing that it is indeed necessary for each exchange to collect margin money within a reasonable scope. However, how to collect it and what methods to adopt must be carefully reviewed by the Finance and Industry Committee of the Legislative Yuan to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Seeking Opinions on Curbing Monopoly</p>
<p>According to reports from various yarn factories, speculators have recently been manipulating the market, causing yarn factories to suffer losses and decline. Therefore, they also sought opinions from various exchanges as much as possible in order to gather them and adopt measures to prevent monopolies and manipulation. There are many opinions from various parties, and after sorting them out and reporting them to Beijing, the government will effectively prohibit them.</p>
<p>Meeting with Supervision Commissioners to Improve Efficiency</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance have established exchange supervision commissioners in Shanghai to improve administrative efficiency. This time, they also investigated their work and the confirmation of the title of supervision commissioner, as well as the advancement of their work. In the future, both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry will implement this work effectively to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>National Government Decides to Levy Transaction Tax</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Shi said that various exchanges have requested a postponement of the transaction tax. The Legislative Yuan has already discussed and announced various collection methods. As for the date of implementation, it is unknown because the laws stipulate that some laws will be implemented from the date of announcement, while others will be implemented by order of the National Government. Therefore, whether to postpone the collection for one year depends on the National Government because this law belongs to the latter category. Mr. Shi and Mr. Chen are scheduled to take the express train to Beijing on the evening of the 6th to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting and report on everything.</p>

Masaryk spared no effort in running for the unification of Czech in Europe during and after the war. Later, he was elected president for his contribution to the country and has been re-elected to this day. His achievements are praised by the Czech people, so they are very excited to celebrate his birthday.</p>

<p>After Completing the Bandit Suppression Work, He Will Build Highways in Four Provinces</p>
<p>Decided to Go to Sichuan at the End of the Month to Inspect the Situation in the Province</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, went to Hubei with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at the invitation of Chairman Chiang some time ago to discuss financial issues and the National Economic Council. He returned to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month after completing his official duties. Mr. Song then met with reporters from various newspapers at the Shanghai office of the council on West Einstein Road at 5:00 PM yesterday and made the following statement:</p>
<p>Building Highways in Four Provinces</p>
<p>According to Mr. Song, his mission this time with Finance Minister Kong to Hubei to meet with Chairman Chiang was slightly different. Kong discussed financial issues, while he discussed highways in Sichuan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces with Chairman Chiang. Because the central government is determined to suppress bandits in Sichuan Province, the construction of highways into Sichuan is a very important issue, so it was decided to start construction immediately to complete it in the shortest possible time. The highway routes in the four provinces have been determined: the Hubei-Sichuan trunk road, the Shaanxi-Sichuan trunk road, and the Gansu-Sichuan trunk road will all end in Chongqing. The Hubei-Sichuan road, which runs from Hankou through Xiangyang, Fancheng, and other places to Chongqing, is being built by the Hubei Provincial Government. The Shaanxi-Sichuan and Gansu-Sichuan roads are also being built by the respective provincial governments. The total construction cost of the three highways is estimated to be seven to eight million yuan, and planning is underway. It has been decided to allocate funds from the surplus of aviation highway lottery tickets and from local funds of various provincial governments.</p>
<p>Decided to Go to Sichuan at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The National Economic Council has decided to actively carry out construction in Sichuan Province and plans to set up an office in a suitable location in Sichuan. He himself has decided to go to Sichuan at the end of this month to investigate the current situation in the province. He plans to go to all parts of Sichuan after arriving in Sichuan. The inspection period is tentatively set for two weeks. As for going to Guizhou Province, although this decision has been made, he does not plan to go there on this trip. He will schedule another trip to Guizhou after returning to Shanghai from the Sichuan inspection.</p>
<p>Haas Will Soon Complete His Term</p>
<p>Dr. Haas, the League of Nations' technical cooperation liaison officer to China, is currently in Beijing to discuss everything with the National Economic Council. Dr. Haas is here to inspect the construction situation in our country and to liaise on technical cooperation with China. He has made considerable contributions to water conservancy development, road construction, and hygiene implementation. He will soon complete his term and return to Geneva. It is also learned that Dr. Haas will leave Beijing to inspect Shaanxi and other provinces. Whether the League of Nations will continue to send technical liaison personnel to China will depend on whether it is needed.</p>
<p>National Water Conservancy Issues</p>
<p>Regarding national water conservancy issues, a water conservancy committee has been established under the National Economic Council, with Standing Committee Member Kong Xiangxi as the chairman. Various matters are underway. The fundamental solution to the Yellow River is also being compiled into a report by various experts in Beijing. As for the Huai River diversion issue, technical personnel, based on geographical observations, all advocate diverting the Huai River southward into the Yangtze River, which is more suitable than diverting the Huai River into the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e109">China Communications and Other Five Banks Organize Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Committee to Discuss Implementation Plan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company, which will be organized by banks in this city, has taken concrete form. This matter has a significant impact on the flow of funds between the interior and Shanghai, so merchants in the interior also attach great importance to it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Capital of One Million</p>
<p>The banks participating in the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company include the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Farmers Bank, with a capital of one million yuan, which is shared equally by the five banks. This matter has been discussed by the banks for a long time and has recently taken concrete form. The articles of association of the company have been decided by the banks, and it will be announced and start operations soon after the banks pay the funds.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province to Be Piloted First</p>
<p>The banks, in view of the fact that the flow of funds between the interior and Shanghai has been hampered by the sluggish market, have decided to organize the company after several consultations. However, because China is vast, it is difficult to popularize it all at once, so they will start with Jiangsu Province first. Jiangsu Province has a close relationship with Shanghai and is known to be wealthy, making it very convenient for business operations. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has expressed its willingness to do its best to facilitate business operations. After the province has achieved results, it will be promoted to other provinces.</p>
<p>Organizing Committee</p>
<p>Each bank participating in the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company will nominate one member to form a committee to discuss various implementation plans. Offices will be set up separately in all inland areas of Jiangsu Province to facilitate contact with inland merchants. In the past, inland merchants relied on money shops for funds, but in recent years, the business of money shops has experienced problems, so merchants feel that their economic turnover is not flexible. After the establishment of the company, it will be operated entirely in the form of draft remittance and mortgage, which is not only stable for the banks themselves, but also convenient for merchants.</p>

<p>The General Office of Postal Remittances and Savings of the Ministry of Communications was previously ordered to relocate to Beijing. However, due to the business relationship of the office, the relocation to Beijing may cause many difficulties. Therefore, although it is planned to expand the Shanghai Office after the relocation of the General Office, expenses will inevitably increase. Therefore, after Director Shen Shuyu of the General Office asked Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications for instructions, it was decided to postpone the relocation to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Promoters of Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory Held a Tea Party in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Inviting Guests from All Walks of Life and Raising Funds on the Spot</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory has been planned and promoted by Mr. Du Chongyuan and the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and is largely in place. The promoters in Shanghai, Zhang Gongquan, Li Shizeng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, etc., held a tea party at the World Society on Ferguson Road at 4:00 PM on March 4th, inviting leaders from all walks of life. The guests who attended included Mayor Wu, Cai, Director of the Finance Bureau, Cai Yuanpei, Xu Shiying, Zhang Shizhao, Zhao Jinqing, Li Dachao, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zhixin, Song Ziliang, Chen Liting, Tang Shoumin, Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, Fang Yixian, Xiang Kangyuan, Pan Xulun, and more than 40 celebrities from the financial and industrial sectors. First,</p>
<p>Li Shizeng stood up and gave a speech, saying roughly that porcelain is a daily necessity with a large consumption, and it is a business that is very worth running. Now, there is considerable professional talent, Mr. Du Chongyuan, in charge. The Jiangxi Provincial Government is also very enthusiastic about promoting this kind of production business. It is hoped that comrades from the financial and industrial sectors in Shanghai will give special support and enthusiastically invest. Then,</p>
<p>Zhang Gongquan spoke, saying roughly that he was in Shenyang at the time of the September 18th Incident. At that time, all the staff of various agencies in Shenyang fled, and all industrial and commercial sectors stopped business. However, the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory run by Mr. Du Chongyuan, although adjacent to Beida Camp, the starting point of the incident, continued to work as usual in the factory under the fire of artillery. When he visited the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory, the order and spirit of the workers in the entire factory were still exceptionally high, and there was no panic at all. After touring the entire factory at that time, he felt very surprised. He deeply admired Mr. Du Chongyuan's fearless spirit and his usual training of employees. At that time, because all the banks in Shenyang were closed, the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory could not turn around financially, and he had entrusted the Shenyang branch of his bank to help the factory. At that time, it was only out of a kind of emotional effect. He felt that such a factory should not be allowed to close down under any circumstances. As for whether the factory could maintain itself and whether it could repay the debt in the future, he did not consider it at the time. Later, the order in Shenyang gradually recovered, and the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory continued to operate. According to the Shenyang branch report last year, the debts of the Zhaoxin Factory have been repaid in full one after another, so he felt that Mr. Du Chongyuan's honest attitude in handling affairs was worthy of praise and worthy of introduction. Now, about the process of establishing the Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory, please Mr. Du report.</p>
<p>Du Chongyuan reported that last year, he was introduced by Minister Kong to Jiangxi to discuss with Chairman Tai the establishment of a mechanical porcelain factory. Because the Jiangxi Provincial Government has the greatest determination to develop Jiangxi porcelain, it has adopted his personal opinions as much as possible. After consultation, the first thing was that the Jiangxi Provincial Government allocated 200,000 yuan as a start-up capital. As for the organization, it was completely in accordance with commercial methods. The second thing was that the provincial government guaranteed commercial shares with an annual interest of 6% for three years, that is, if the porcelain factory has no profit to split within three years of opening, the mountain provincial government will be responsible for issuing commercial shares with an interest of 6%. The above two measures have been passed by the Jiangxi Provincial Government Conference, and the share money of 200,000 yuan was allocated by the Mountain Provincial Government in November of last year. He went to Pingjin in January of this year to collect share money from his fellow villagers in the Northeast. In Beiping, it was initiated by Mr. Shen Baifei, Song Shoushan, and Li Xiangzhai. In Tianjin, it was initiated by General Ma Zhanshan, Director Lu Jiqing, and Director Xu Huazhou. It stayed in Pingjin for about a week and raised more than 200,000 yuan in share money. At that time, the cash deposited in the bank was 125,000 yuan. As for Shanghai, before he went to Jiangxi last year, he had a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Shi Liangcai in Hangzhou. Mr. Shi was very concerned about the business he was running and promised to do his best to help and indicated that he would bear the full responsibility for the Shanghai share money. When he arrived in Jiangxi not long ago, Mr. Shi suddenly died in an accident on his way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou. He was deeply grieved, causing the Shanghai share money to suffer a sudden setback. Fortunately, he received the enthusiastic help of Mr. Gongquan and Mr. Yuesheng, so that the fundraising work could continue as before. It is estimated that the share money from all parties has been recognized to be about 700,000 yuan, and there is still a shortage of 300,000 yuan from the original share money. As for the share money from other provinces, according to his plan, he plans to set up branch factories in Changsha and Jinan in the future, so he has asked Chairman Han Xiangfang of Shandong Province and Chairman He Yunqiao of Hunan Province to give special help. Also in Xijing, he has asked Chairman Shao Zhonghui and Director Yang Hucheng to raise funds on his behalf. Although he does not dare to be completely confident in establishing a porcelain factory, he is confident that foreign porcelain factories use mechanical manufacturing and implement scientific management, and their porcelain factory also operates in the same way. As for sales, their porcelain factory mass-produces daily necessities, such as porcelain electrical materials used by transportation agencies, and tableware and ceramic tiles used by ordinary people, which is expected to be in short supply. Moreover, foreign porcelain imports have a 40% tariff, and the Ministry of Finance allows their porcelain factory to sell to various provinces tax-free. With the joint efforts of the government and the people, it is possible to defeat foreign porcelain. The future of the porcelain factory is absolutely optimistic. Today, he is grateful to the guests from all walks of life for taking the time to come, and he is grateful to the masters for initiating the banquet in their busy schedules. He will briefly report on the origin of the preparation of the Guangda Porcelain Factory and the fundraising process, and express his gratitude.</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi said that in the spring of 1931, Mr. Du Chongyuan once raised new shares for the Liaoning Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory and raised tens of thousands of yuan in Shanghai. In the autumn of the same year, the September 18th Incident happened, and the shareholders in Shanghai thought that this share capital must be completely lost. Later, Mr. Du Chongyuan, in view of the fact that the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory had lost its hope for development under the pressure of foreign forces, soon after the incident, he took out all the share money that Shanghai could invest in from the Liaoning Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory and returned it to the Shanghai shareholders. He deeply admired Mr. Du's integrity and was willing to supplement a little personal opinion in this tea party.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu inquired that he had been to Liaoning and visited the Zhaoxin Porcelain Factory run by Mr. Du Chongyuan. The products in his factory are not what they usually see in Shanghai. They are completely ordinary daily necessities, and most of them are sold to various rural areas, so he felt that the failure of Jiangxi porcelain to develop in the past was actually biased towards art. Its finished products are for a very small number of people to buy as antiques, so each piece of fine porcelain is very expensive and has no practical use. And a delicate ornament is always treasured and not easily damaged, so that the sales of the products are extremely narrow, and all electrical materials and daily necessities are completely made of foreign porcelain, which makes the leakage of funds more and more serious. It is really heartbreaking. The first reason why Mr. Du Chongyuan succeeded is that he obtained the largest outlet for sales and abandoned the manufacture of art for people to appreciate. The second reason why Mr. Du Chongyuan succeeded is that he worked sincerely and earnestly based on what he had learned. He did not aim too high, did not do ideal work that was not easy to do temporarily, and specialized in doing things that were easy to achieve and easy to succeed. He thought that with Mr. Du's past experience, it was most suitable to develop the porcelain industry in Jiangxi in terms of people. When the porcelain factory starts work in the future, all porcelain electrical materials used by government agencies can be ordered from the porcelain factory, and the social necessities can be supplied by the porcelain factory. There are too many opportunities for development in terms of sales. The business is bound to be successful. He very much hopes that the comrades from all walks of life and those who intend to invest will pay attention together and help each other.</p>
<p>Xu Junren gave a speech that his friend Chen Dazhang had previously established a porcelain company in Jingdezhen. According to his friend's experience, if he bought a machine for 5,000 yuan, he could produce 6,000 pieces of porcelain a day. If he used twelve workers and manufactured by hand, he could only produce 300 pieces a day. How can Chinese handicraft resist foreign porcelain? In the future, if the mechanical porcelain factory in Jiangxi is established, its output will definitely create an amazing number in porcelain production, so he is eager for its early success, etc. Finally,</p>
<p>Li Shizeng proposed that on the spot, he asked the supporters to write down the amount of money they would raise and to be responsible for paying the shares within three months. It was estimated that more than 100,000 yuan of share money was raised on the spot. The remaining share money of 200,000 yuan was shared equally by the masters of the tea party today. The guests and hosts toasted each other and dispersed happily until 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>Travel Industry Association Will Continue to Proceed</p>
<p>The General Office of the Shanghai City Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association decided to collect 50,000 yuan of aviation salvation donations from the Aviation Industry Association during the first solicitation, but it was suspended. Now that the second solicitation movement has continued, a letter was sent to the association, hoping that it would continue its past enthusiasm and implement it immediately to collect the original amount to benefit aviation salvation.</p>
<p>The General Office had previously sent a letter to various groups in the city to join the Chinese Aviation Association as group members. In recent days, various groups have sent letters agreeing to join and paid membership fees very enthusiastically. It has been reported in various newspapers that the Money Industry Association also replied yesterday, agreeing to join and paying membership fees, which shows the enthusiasm of various groups.</p>
<p>Wu Qiding, the captain of the 161st team, asked to hire Wang Zongzhu and Jin Gong as the deputy captains of the team. Dong Dayou, the captain of the 306th team, asked to hire Chen Chengneng as the deputy captain of the team. It is reported that the General Office has separately hired them. Since the start of work, various solicitation teams have been working very hard. The various solicitation documents issued before were not enough to be distributed. In recent days, many letters and telegrams have been sent to the General Office, asking for more solicitation documents. It is reported that yesterday, Jin Liren, the captain of the 152nd team, asked for 2,000 more badges and membership applications, 100 receipt books for membership fees, and 200 copies of the solicitation movement at a glance. Tang Haian, the captain of the 34th team, asked for 500 each of badges and membership applications, which were sent by the office.</p>
<p>After Cai Xiangsun, the captain of the 279th team, started soliciting donations, he was very diligent. It is reported that yesterday, he first deposited the membership fees he had received, 184 yuan, in the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank on behalf of the collection.</p>

<p>Offenders Must Be Released Within 24 Hours</p>
<p>Former Municipal Police Chief Wen Chaoji resigned due to illness after serving for less than two months. The new Police Chief, Cai Jinjun, was officially sworn in the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed a senior official from the Police Bureau, who, in a casual conversation about Mr. Wen's character, stated that Mr. Wen served for a total of only forty-nine days, from the time he took office until his resignation. However, although his tenure was brief, his dedication to his duties was truly admirable. What most benefited the citizens and made them forever grateful was that, from the beginning of his tenure, Mr. Wen immediately issued an order to all subordinate police stations and judicial departments, stipulating that, henceforth, regardless of the type of offender, they must all be interrogated and submitted for review within 24 hours. Those who could be released should be released, and those who needed to be transferred should be transferred, so as to avoid the suffering of the people being unjustly detained. This single measure alone reveals a glimpse of Mr. Wen's sincerity in his work, and so on.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army's 30,000 yuan fundraising campaign officially began the day before yesterday. The Advisory Committee held a meeting at the Western YMCA on the same day to discuss the progress of the campaign. Chinese representatives included Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and educator Dr. Kuang Fuzhuo, among others. Dr. Kuang gave a speech praising the Salvation Army's achievements and hoping that it would devote more efforts to the Chinese people in the future. Afterwards, Mr. Dapp, the Shanghai Division Commander of the Salvation Army, gave a reply, saying that the Salvation Army has more than ninety dedicated locations throughout China devoted to relieving Chinese people. Taking Beiping as an example, from December 15th to March 15th, the Salvation Army provided food to more than 6,000 poor and helpless Chinese people. In Shanghai, it has provided assistance to a particularly large number of Chinese ex-convicts. Other speakers included Sir Brenan, the British Consul General in Shanghai, and Mr. Flanery, President of the American Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that although only three days have passed, more than 5,000 yuan has already been raised. The British-American Tobacco Company alone donated 1,000 yuan. In addition, companies such as the Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Ewo &amp; Co. have all made donations. Donations from all sectors, regardless of size, are welcome and should be sent to the Shanghai Division of the Salvation Army at 422 North Suzhou Road.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Organizational Methods of Various Marketing Cooperatives (Continued) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Stephen's Speech</p>
<p>Here is an example to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the centralized and federated models. In Michigan, USA, there is the Michigan Potato Growers Exchange, a federated potato marketing cooperative. In Minnesota, there is the Minnesota Potato Growers Exchange, a centralized potato marketing cooperative. The central cooperative of the centralized model has storage rooms, while in the federated model, each cooperative has its own. In the federated cooperative of Michigan, if a new method of grading is invented, the head office can only send instructors to advise the branches to implement it, but if the branches do not agree, it will not take effect, and leaving the cooperative is very free. However, this is not the case with the cooperative in Minnesota. Whenever a new policy is to be implemented, it only needs to be approved by more than half of the directors to order the district offices to comply. It will not be changed due to the disagreement of some members. If there is disagreement, the only option is to withdraw from the cooperative. However, with regard to individual withdrawal, once withdrawn, there is no opportunity to cooperate and market on their own, as in the federated model. The opportunity for marketing cooperation disappears because all its powers are governed by the central cooperative. This is not the case with the federated cooperative. If it withdraws, its organization still exists and can be re-integrated to carry out marketing activities without being affected.</p>
<p>The trademark of the potatoes produced by the Michigan Cooperative is a triangular symbol. The ownership of this trademark belongs to the federated cooperative. The products of all branches must be of equivalent grade before the triangular trademark can be applied. This trademark already has considerable credibility in society. Several branches have withdrawn because the restrictions of the federated cooperative were too strict, and marketed separately. As a result, the results were poor, and they rejoined. This is indeed an excellent way to teach a lesson to the cooperative, and at the same time, it does not affect the entire cooperative business due to the withdrawal of a few branches. The centralized cooperative in Minnesota is different. In the area of the cooperative, the soil types in each district are different. One district is sandy soil, so potatoes mature very early and can be sold at a good price. The potatoes produced in other districts with clay soil need to be stored and sold gradually. Not only is the selling price not as good as those that mature early, but also the funds required for the special construction of warehouses are quite large. Therefore, the farmers in the sandy soil area are dissatisfied with the average calculation of the selling price and the warehouse construction funds that are not necessary for themselves and must be reluctantly borne, and feel that the treatment is unfair. The potatoes in the sandy soil area are sold early because they mature early, and there is no need for special warehouse equipment, and those that mature early ask for early settlement to avoid additional interest. However, the cooperative is afraid that early settlement will affect the financial turnover of the entire cooperative, and does not allow the request. Therefore, the farmers in the sandy soil area expressed dissatisfaction with the cooperative. Some say, why not divide the members of the two districts with different natures into two groups and price them separately? However, because the centralized model takes the policy that everything must be decided by the board of directors, and the directors are elected separately by each district, the clay soil area occupies the majority in the area of the cooperative, so most of the directors are thinking for the benefit of the clay soil area. This method is difficult to achieve. In this situation, if in the Michigan Federated Cooperative, the members of the sandy soil area, if they are not satisfied, can withdraw from the federation in an organized way and still cooperate in marketing. However, the centralized model is not possible, because after withdrawal, they become individuals and lose the opportunity to cooperate in marketing. The final result of the Minnesota Cooperative is that some members requested early settlement without success, felt that the treatment was unfair, and requested to withdraw from the cooperative. However, due to the restrictions of the contract, they were helpless. These branch cooperatives launched a major attack on the cooperative. Later, because they could not bear it, they withdrew from the cooperative regardless of the constraints of the law. Therefore, the burden on the remaining members of the cooperative to bear the entire equipment increased. As a result, the remaining members also expressed dissatisfaction, leading to the failure and disintegration of the centralized cooperative. In addition to Minnesota, there is also a potato centralized cooperative in Maine, in the east, which also failed. The federated cooperative in Michigan can still operate to this day, and the life of the California Fruit Marketing Cooperative, a federated cooperative, is also very long, because the organization of the federated model is relatively free.

<p>To Discuss Spring Relief Issues with Chairman Huang</p>
<p>The Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, organized by Zhejiang gentry and merchants in Shanghai, in view of the severity of the Zhejiang disaster and the importance of spring relief, plans to undertake the fundraising and distribution of spring relief funds in separate batches with the Shanghai-based fundraising organizations for drought disasters in various provinces and the Zhejiang Relief Association. After repeated meetings and discussions, it has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the association, considering that the spring plowing and relief distribution are imminent and cannot be delayed, has specially elected Vice Chairman Zhang Xiaolin and Relief Group Director Qu Wenliu to go to Hangzhou to discuss everything with the provincial government and the Zhejiang Relief Association. The text of their telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Huang of the Hangzhou Provincial Government and all the officials of the Zhejiang Relief Association, the spring relief distribution is very urgent. This association has sent two committee members, Zhang Xiaolin and Qu Wenliu, to Hangzhou to discuss solutions. Please make contact with them. Sincerely, etc."</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Drought Relief Association Reports Detailed Records of Relief Distribution in Liyang and Ten Other Counties <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Association of Various Provinces yesterday received a detailed relief distribution report from Cheng Yiqing, the Jiangsu Inspection Director of the Association, on the relief distribution in Liyang, Lishui, and ten other counties in Jiangsu. The report listed the severity of the disaster, the number of households investigated, the distribution of relief funds, and the levels of distribution in great detail. However, the disaster was widespread and the funds were meager, so the principle of saving the dying rather than the poor was adopted, and strict deductions were made. However, it was still a drop in the bucket and difficult to universalize. Spring relief is approaching, and the time between the exhaustion of the old harvest and the arrival of the new is particularly critical. If the relief is not increased, the number of deaths will inevitably increase day by day. Benefactors at home and abroad, after carefully examining the details of the disaster in the table, will surely know that emergency relief cannot be delayed. Feelings will arise, and they will take off their clothes and share their food, not shirking their responsibility. Saving a person's life is better than building a seven-story pagoda, and the merits are truly immeasurable. Detailed list of the disaster in each county is as follows:</p>
<p>The entire territory of Liyang County suffered a complete crop failure. In addition, sericulture has gone bankrupt in the past three years, and ten houses out of ten are empty. Countless people have sold their sons and daughters, and most of the able-bodied men have fled. The food is completely bran and wild vegetables for sustenance. It should be listed as a particularly severe disaster area. Lishui County's entire county is divided into five districts, with the first and second districts being the most severe, the third and fourth districts being the next most severe, and the fifth district being less affected. Except for the fifth district, it is generally the same as Liyang, but its food is mainly weathered stones. There are deaths every day, and it should be listed as a particularly severe disaster area. Gaochun County's entire territory is divided into five districts. Except for the second district, all the fourth and fifth districts are affected, which is the most severe. Three-fifths of the third district is the most severe, and three-fifths of the first district is the next most severe. After investigation and deduction, there are more than 121,100 disaster victims, including men, women, old, and young, who cannot be further reduced. More than 70,000 people cannot survive without relief. The food relies entirely on four types: weathered stones, elm bark, buckwheat hulls, and wild vegetables. There are more deaths in the fourth and fifth districts, and the rest are also pale and emaciated, a tragic sight. It should be listed as the most severe disaster area. Jiangpu County's entire territory is mountainous and has always been barren. The entire county is divided into five districts. The first and second districts, bordering the river, still have a thin harvest. The third, fourth, and fifth districts are mountainous, with the fourth district being particularly large, accounting for half of the county, and the most severely affected. There are no grains harvested, and they are now filling their stomachs with grass roots. There have been deaths. Child murder cases due to hunger have occurred repeatedly in Tangquan Town. It should be listed as the most severe disaster area. Jurong County's entire county is divided into five districts, with the third and fourth districts being the most severe and the first, second, and fifth districts being lighter. The people are displaced and there are deaths every day. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. The food is mostly wild vegetables, sugar bran, and weathered stones. It should be listed as a severe disaster area. Jintan County's entire county is divided into six districts, all of which have suffered from drought, especially the second, fifth, and sixth districts, which are as miserable as Jurong. It should be listed as a severe disaster area. Yixing County's entire county is divided into eight districts, with the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts being the most severe, the first and eighth districts being the next most severe, and the second and third districts being lighter. In the most severe districts, the tragic situation is similar to Jurong and Jintan. Selling sons and daughters is often heard, and countless people have fled the country. It should be listed as a severe disaster area. Zhenjiang County's entire county is divided into seven districts. Except for the seventh district, which is not affected, the (3), (5), and (6) districts are the most severe, and the (1), (2), and (4) districts are the next most severe. The most severe districts are indeed miserable. It should be listed as a secondary severe disaster area. Jiangning County's new second, new third, and new sixth districts are all affected, and most of the rest are partial disasters. Danyang County's entire county is divided into eight districts, with the third and seventh districts being the most severe, the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts being the next most severe, and the first, second, and eighth districts being the next most severe. The Association has allocated three times relief funds to Jiangsu Province, totaling 100,000 yuan, which were handed over to the investigation and distribution director for distribution. According to the list in this table, 59,672 yuan has been allocated and distributed, and there are still more than 40,000 yuan that have not been allocated. We previously requested an additional allocation of 10,000 yuan for Lishui and 8,000 yuan for Gaochun. If approved, the remaining amount would be approximately 22,000 yuan. According to Deputy Director Li, the amount is used to support the lighter disaster areas of Wujin, Luhe, Yizheng, and Jiangdu. The number of deficits may not be too many. However, spring relief is extremely urgent. What we have seen and heard makes us feel that if we do not increase the spring relief in the seven counties listed above, the number of deaths will inevitably increase day by day. Floods are difficult to manage at the beginning, and droughts are difficult to manage at the end, which are extremely important. We also respectfully state,</p>

<p>Promoting Pine Nut Oil and Kaolin to Overseas Markets</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of International Trade, in recent years, European and American import and export merchants have often sent letters to the Bureau requesting the introduction and purchase of domestic products, and domestic manufacturers have also sent letters to the Bureau requesting the introduction and promotion of foreign countries. In today's depressed economic climate, the only way to rescue domestic manufacturers is to expand the sales of domestic products. The recent requests from foreign merchants for introductions are described below:</p>
<p>The United States Needs Pine Nut Oil</p>
<p>Pine nuts are brown triangular seeds grown on pine trees. When the shell is removed, the inside contains soft kernels with a fragrant aroma, which is generally recognized as a tonic that can prolong life, increase muscle, and is commonly used to make sweets. In medicine, it can be used to treat coughs and constipation. Now, scientists have found that pine nut oil is extremely rich in vitamin A and can be used to manufacture a medicine. The World Produce Trading Company of the United States has sent a letter requesting this pine nut oil. If you are in the business of this product, you can send a letter to the Bureau's Guidance Department for introduction.</p>
<p>Dutch Dye Factories Need Kaolin</p>
<p>Kaolin is a pure silica, a natural weathered porcelain clay. When pure, it is a fine, clean white powder. Its main uses are as a raw material for making porcelain and sizing paper and yarn. The number exported from Shanghai every year is quite large. The Frankentant Dyeworks of the Netherlands has sent a letter requesting an introduction to kaolin merchants for the purpose of trading. If you wish to promote this product overseas, you can send a letter to the Bureau for introduction.</p>

<p>Three Women Found Hanged</p>
<p>One Floating Corpse Retrieved</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Local Court, based on reports from local security, requested the verification of three female corpses who had hanged themselves and one floating corpse. It is rare to find three female corpses hanging themselves in one day. The details of each case are recorded separately below: Yang Gao, the wife of Yang San, a Baoying native, aged 30, who lived in a thatched shed in a lime kiln in West Shanghai, went home from work at noon the day before yesterday and had an argument with her mother-in-law. Angered, she hanged herself. The verification was carried out by local security Dong Xiqing. Another resident, Wang Gao, a Jiangbei woman, aged 24, who lived in a thatched shed on Pingliang Road, west of the North Shanghai Dayang Bridge, felt that she could not make ends meet due to difficult living conditions and often could not afford three meals a day. Yesterday, she quarreled with her husband, Wang Si (formerly a laborer), because she had no money to buy rice. Resentful, she took her own life by hanging herself with her belt. The verification was reported by local security Zhang Fengqi. Another Yangzhou woman, Du Hu, aged 64, who lived at 31 Xiyangjiazhai, Pudong, had been a widow for many years and relied on her son, Du Zhonghao, for a living. Recently, Zhonghao suddenly lost his job, and the family's expenses were in a panic. They pawned their belongings day by day. Du Hu thought that the future was long and life was worse than death, so she hanged herself the night before while her son and daughter-in-law were asleep. When she was discovered yesterday morning, it was too late. The verification was reported by local security Lu Shunlong. A nameless male corpse of about 30 years old, wearing a black cotton jacket, blue cloth pants, bean-colored thread socks, and leather shoe-style cotton shoes, was found in the Suzhou River at the Xinqiao of the Shamban Factory in North Shanghai yesterday morning. The corpse floated there and it was not known where it came from. It was found by the patrol boat of the Second Patrol Team and was instructed by local security Li Ruiru to report it for verification. Inspector Tang Rushu was commissioned to lead the examiners to inspect the scene and verify the coffin.</p>

<p>Multiple Dismissals in the Past Few Days</p>
<p>Workers Are Very Angry</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, regarding the issue of worker bonuses, based on the announcement issued by the company's former General Manager Jian Zhaonan in 1933, requested that the accounts be made public and specially appointed representatives to petition the company authorities. As a result, the authorities agreed to meet with the representatives in the General Manager's office at a scheduled time for discussion. However, the representatives felt that the matter should be made public and were unwilling to go upstairs to the General Manager's office to talk, so they still waited in the reception room downstairs, resulting in a stalemate. At this time, the company suddenly removed the bonus announcement that had been posted the year before, and the workers were even more panicked. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. Later, the factory manager re-posted the announcement, but the representatives' request to be received by the General Manager was not resolved that day. On the afternoon of the first day of this month, at 4:00 PM, the company authorities suddenly dismissed the workers' nine representatives and eight alternates, and notified the relevant police station to send a large number of detectives to the factory to suppress them. The next day, in the afternoon, the factory workers were very angry and prepared to petition the company again, demanding that the order be withdrawn and that all the representatives be reinstated. It is still unpredictable whether the company will accept the conditions put forward by the workers. However, yesterday, six more workers were dismissed by the company.</p>

<p>To Be Sent to Court Today for Interrogation</p>
<p>Xu Meiying, a woman from Jiangwan, is 28 years old and has a certain beauty. She used to be a worker in the Lake Silk Store. Five years ago, after becoming acquainted with Gu Xiaodi, a copper craftsman who repairs cars, she changed her career and became a hostess in the Dajing Opera Theater in the rooftop garden of the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road, and became known as the "Hot Water Thermos and Glass Cup." She lived with her lover at 88 Jin Shenfu Road, the front room on the third floor of the Yuanshenchang Porcelain Shop. At 9:00 AM on the first day of this month, Gu Xiaodi went to work at the Yuanheng Auto Repair Company on Lafayette Road. Xu was sleeping alone at home when a man in short clothes broke into her home, untied the trousers belt around Xu's waist, strangled Xu to death, and stole a gold bracelet worth more than 400 yuan, three gold rings, and dozens of yuan in cash. At noon, her lover, Gu Xiaodi, returned home for lunch and discovered the incident, reporting it to the French Concession Police, who transported the body to the coroner's office. The next day, he reported it to the Second Special Court, which sent personnel to verify the incident and ordered the body to be collected. At the same time, the police ordered all the detectives to strictly arrest the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice for interrogation. As reported in previous newspapers, Zhou Bingcheng, the deputy detective of the special agency of the French Concession Police, received a tip-off from an informant yesterday morning and rushed to the Xile Teahouse at the intersection of Taipingqiao Caishilu Ximen Road, arresting the murderer, Xue Xiaodi (also known as Xiaodidi, age, occupation, and residence unknown), a local resident. He was taken to the police station for interrogation. According to Xue, he admitted to going to steal property, and because Xu resisted, he strangled her to death. It is also rumored that Xue was the lover of the deceased and had a physical relationship with her. He wanted to marry Xu and asked her to divorce Gu, but Xu refused, so he resented her and killed her. Whether this is true remains to be verified. The police are currently summoning the coroner and the second landlord, Wang Nianzu, for identification and conducting a thorough investigation. He will be sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation this morning.</p>

<p>Nerve Confusion Due to Alcohol, Opens Fire and Takes His Own Life</p>
<p>The Russian man, Laisidelangao, aged 35, is currently working as a bodyguard for a wealthy businessman. He has a wife and rents a room on the third floor, room 7, No. 2, Lane 106, Huanlong Road, French Concession. He usually leaves early and returns late, as usual. However, he is naturally fond of alcohol. With a pot in hand, he will only stop when he is completely drunk. Yesterday evening at 8:00 PM, Laisilai returned to his residence after finishing work and had dinner with his wife at the table until 8:30 PM. At that time, Laisilai was already drunk. Laisilai's wife went downstairs to sort out some trivial matters. Unexpectedly, within two minutes, two gunshots were heard upstairs. Those living together knew something was wrong. When they entered room 7, Laisilai was lying on the ground with two bullets in his right temple and cheek, bleeding profusely. The pistol was thrown on the ground and he died on the spot. It was obviously suicide. Someone immediately called the French Concession Police, and the head detective immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. According to Laisilai's wife, the deceased was usually very amiable, and there were never any conflicts between husband and wife. This sudden suicide was caused by nerve confusion due to drunkenness. After the detectives finished their investigation, they transported the body to the sanitation office to report it for examination.</p>

<p>Due to Hui Er of the Jiaxing Road Police Station</p>
<p>Abuse of Power and Arbitrary Extortion</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, we have received a joint letter from the Ningbo Shanghai Association and the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Association, signed by Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai, stating that according to the letter from Xu Shanqin, shareholder and manager, and Wu Rumao, coordinator, of the Wuzhou New Inn on Wuzhou Road, Hongkou, the Western police chief No. 64 of the Jiaxing Road Harbin Police Station, transliterated as Hui Er, often uses the excuse of checking hotels, abuses his power, and arbitrarily extorts money. If his wishes are not met, he will use his fists and feet. On the evening of the 9th of last month, at 12:00 PM, the Western police chief saw a guest, Mr. Shen, who looked like a servant, and insulted him. Even the tea boy, Shen Jinhe, was beaten and injured, and there is a injury list from the Tongren Hospital to prove it. The two were twisted and taken to the police station for interrogation, but they were released because there was no evidence of illegal activity. Such violent actions have made travelers afraid, and the hotel's business has been affected. We request this association to send a letter to your department, forwarding it to the Public Works Department, for strict negotiation in order to ensure business and respect humanity, etc. To the Association, we believe that the establishment of the Public Works Department was originally for the safety of Chinese and foreign people. Now that the Western police chief is so violent, the suffering of merchants is unspeakable. Your department is responsible for supervising the Public Works Department. We hope that you will send a letter to the Public Works Department to investigate the facts and punish them according to law, in order to uphold justice and maintain the difficulties of business, etc. The matter concerns the illegal behavior of the Western police chief, and we hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will order the relevant department to investigate and deal with it and give it appropriate legal treatment in order to maintain business and clarify responsibility. To the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>

<p>Jilaiyang Shipping Company's Ships Enter Fujian's Inland Ports</p>
<p>Not Only Infringing on Navigation Rights But Also Violating Treaties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Transportation: On the 4th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, a member of our Chamber, stating that the Zhen'an Shipping Company reported that the Kthel Moller ship of the Jilaiyang Shipping Company had loaded cargo and sailed to Xiuyu, Fuqing, Xinghua, and other ports in Fujian Province. These ports are all inland ports where foreign ships have not previously operated. Currently, the Fuan and Fuping ships operate on these routes and are sufficient to meet the needs. Now, foreign ships, in violation of treaty provisions, are loading passengers and cargo and rashly sailing there, intentionally infringing on navigation rights. Furthermore, we have heard that the company also intends to send the Margaret Moller and Chrhtine Moller ships. If this is not stopped, the consequences will be endless. We urge the Chamber to promptly forward this to the relevant authorities and strictly prohibit it to protect national rights. We, the Chamber, have investigated and confirmed that Xiuyu and other ports in Fujian Province are inland ports where foreign ships are not allowed to operate according to treaties. It is imperative to stop this. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation to order the relevant authorities to pay attention and stop this trend, we are sending this letter. We respectfully hope that you will investigate and approve our joint support to achieve the prohibition and alleviate the situation." According to this, our inland ports are not permitted for foreign ships to navigate is specified in treaties. Xiuyu, Fuqing, Xinghua, and other ports in Fujian Province are all our inland ports. Jilaiyang Shipping Company has dared to send foreign ships to load passengers and cargo, which not only infringes on our navigation rights but also violates the treaties. To prevent this trend, it is necessary to correct this according to the treaties. We are submitting this report by telegram, requesting your esteemed review and prompt negotiation to make a forceful prohibition to maintain the treaties and protect navigation rights, which is in the public interest. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this with its seal."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Continued Trial of the Wuhua Bank Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of the Guangzhou Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession and the Baxianqiao branch in the French Concession both collapsed on August 21st of last year, depositors and creditors, including Chu Longgen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua, Shi Pengfei, Du Zhiji, Shi Bilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fuji, Pan Yuanji, and others, jointly hired lawyers to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court Criminal Division, accusing Fan Shaoliang, Wang Jian'e, Ye Haitian, and Wu You San, the deputy managers of the Wuhua branches, Xie Shunzhi and Tang Songshan, the assistant managers, and Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian, the consultants, of fraud and breach of trust. The lawsuit alleged that the bank had not registered with the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and had rashly opened for business, using advertisements of five-year and ten-year plans to solicit deposits with high interest rates. The court, after receiving the lawsuit, opened hearings multiple times with Judge Zhang Chaozuo presiding to summon the defendants. The defendants were defended by lawyers Jiang Yiping, Hua Maosheng, Wu Kaisheng, and others. Huang Linsheng, the authorized representative sent by the Guangzhou head office to Shanghai to be responsible for the liquidation, was summoned to the court for questioning. The debate was concluded on January 12th of this year, and the sentencing was scheduled for January 19th. However, the presiding judge stated that the organization of the branch's board of directors and whether the defendants had any shares were not yet clear, so the conclusion of the debate was revoked, and a new debate was scheduled. This was reported previously. Yesterday, Judge Zhang summoned them again in the Criminal Court No. 2. Defendant Tang Shoumin could not attend due to other important matters, and Chen Bingqian could not attend due to illness. The remaining defendants reported with their defense lawyers. After the court opened, the judge announced that the case would be re-examined. First, he asked the plaintiff Chu Longgen about the facts and reasons for the lawsuit. Chu replied that he was accusing the defendants of fraud and breach of trust. They used the bank's name to defraud money and requested that they be punished and the deposits be returned. When asked, the other plaintiffs, Chen Xian and others, stated that their reasons and opinions were the same as Chu's. The court asked defendant Fan Shaoliang, "The court ordered you to submit the organizational structure of the board of directors." Fan replied, "Today, I have asked Lawyer Luo Jiaheng to submit a statement to the court." He also stated, "Headquarters representative Huang Linsheng went to attend the shareholders' meeting because the Guangdong headquarters was holding one, so he could not attend today. I was appointed by the headquarters as the manager of the branch. The assistant manager and the manager are equally responsible, but there is also a supervisor whose responsibility is equal to that of the manager. The assistant managers are hired by the branch manager and reported to the headquarters. The consultants are famous merchants in Shanghai hired by the branch, and their nature is the same as that of consultants. However, consultants and assistant managers do not necessarily have the qualifications for shares, but they can serve. However, among the defendants in the case, it is not clear whether they have shares because many use symbols. I myself have 6,000 yuan of shares. The current state of liquidation is that we originally intended to lease the branch address to Huadong Bank for over 27,000 yuan. This amount could take care of half of the savings portion. However, due to the poor market conditions, Huadong has not yet paid the money after signing the contract, but negotiations are still ongoing." Ye Haitian testified that he had 5,000 yuan of shares and served as assistant manager for ten months. Wang Jian'e testified that he served as the manager of the branch and was appointed by the branch. He had no shares and only worked for two months before the bank collapsed. The savings in the branch's name totaled 13,870 yuan and 86 cents. Wu You San testified that he was appointed by the branch as an assistant manager of the branch and had no shares. Xie Shunzhi testified that he was an assistant manager of the branch and had 3,000 yuan of shares. "My responsibilities and powers as an assistant manager are different from those of ordinary banks in Shanghai. I cannot represent the bank externally, and I cannot interfere with the bank's affairs internally. I only manage business lending affairs." Tang Songshan testified that he served as an assistant manager of the branch and had no shares. "I am only responsible for the business part. I have no power to sign externally, which is different from other banks. Assistant managers in other banks have power, but Wuhua assistant managers have no power. Moreover, there is also a treasurer above me. It is organized according to the Guangdong bank, so my assistant manager is equal to an employee." Accountant Li Cheng also reported on the progress of the liquidation, saying that after taking over, the books were checked until February 17th, and then handed over to Lawyer Luo Jiaheng for handling. Since only 13,000 yuan of debts owed by people were received after taking over, most of them could not be collected due to poor market conditions. The original plan was to distribute a portion of the debts after leasing the branch address. Now this plan cannot be implemented, so it has been handed over to Lawyer Luo. According to the bank's balance sheet, the assets are more than 420,000 yuan, and the debts are 310,000, so the surplus is still over 110,000 yuan. At this point, the judge ordered Fan Shaoliang to report the progress of the liquidation to the court as soon as possible for verification and instructed Accountant Li to provide a written explanation of all the books for filing. Since the defendants were not all present, it was announced that the case would still need to be investigated and that the debate would not be opened. A further hearing was scheduled, and the court was adjourned.</p>

<p>The Traffic Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have stipulated the method for passengers who change from ordinary trains to express trains to supplement their ticket prices. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to station staff: "It is common for passengers on fast or slow trains to transfer to express trains when the former give way at stations to the latter, especially when both are traveling in the same direction. The method for supplementing the fare is now stipulated as follows: (1) If a passenger changes trains, they should first declare it to the conductor or ticket inspector of the train and pay the express surcharge for all miles from the station where the transfer takes place to the final destination on the ticket. The ticket inspector should also note this on the supplemental ticket. (2) If a passenger changes trains without declaring it, they should pay the express train surcharge for all miles between the origin and destination stations on the ticket."</p>

Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the chief of the Criminal Tribunal, was promoted to the Criminal Tribunal No. 1 and announced the main text of the judgment: Bao Zhifang, Zhang Fuyuan, and Chen Jinwen were all sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for jointly intending to defraud money and leaving explosives, causing harm to others. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized can be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor: I am writing to you regarding a news item in yesterday's news column about the enthusiastic recruitment efforts of the various aviation patriotism teams. It stated, "Cai Run Shen, the captain of the 222nd team, is the chairman of the Fruit and Produce Industry Association. After taking office as captain, he immediately convened a meeting of the executive and supervisory committee and immediately decided that all members of the executive and supervisory committee would be the deputy captains and the managers of each line would be the team members, and expanded the recruitment of members to all industries and solicited aviation patriotism donations from outside." Also, "Cai Runshen, the captain of the 222nd team, hired Wang Huaiquan, Xu Runsheng, Cheng Xueshi, Wang Guosheng, and sixteen others as deputy captains of the team." Upon investigation, I resigned from the chairmanship of the association in December of last year, and Mr. Wang Huaiquan was publicly recommended to succeed me, and reports were submitted separately. Subsequently, I received a letter from the Shanghai Recruitment Team General of the China Aviation Association, inviting me to be the captain of the 212th team, and a letter of appointment was attached. Since I had resigned from the chairmanship of the association earlier and generally did not consult on association affairs, I asked Chairman Wang to take on the position of captain and transferred the letter of appointment and other documents to the association. All implementation methods are handled by Chairman Wang. What your newspaper reported does not conform to the facts. I urge you to correct it immediately. With best wishes. Sincerely, Cai Run Shen, March 5th.</p>

<p>Percentage of Important Japanese Export Goods Other Than Raw Silk to China in the 19th Year of the Republic of China. (Unit: Million Japanese Yen)</p>
<p>If we exclude raw silk products, the sales of important Japanese export goods to the Chinese market account for 51%; the amount of Japanese sugar sold to China accounts for 95% of its total exports, flour accounts for 86% of its total exports, paper accounts for 84% of its total exports, seafood accounts for 72% of its total exports, coal accounts for 75% of its total exports, and cotton cloth accounts for 42% of its total exports. From this, we can see how dependent Japanese export trade is on the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Now, let us further study what goods Japan can supply to China after Sino-Japanese economic cooperation under the current unequal international status of China and Japan. Are these goods necessary for China? The revitalization of a country's domestic industry must start with light industry. The leap forward of light industrial products in our country in recent years proves that domestic industry has a bright future. We can understand the development trend of China's domestic industry by looking at the increase and decrease of various commodity exports last year.</p>
<p>Increased Imports Machinery and tools: 16,173,309 yuan. Tobacco: 4,346,516 yuan. Groceries: 3,571,923 yuan. Wool and woolen goods: 2,195,690 yuan. Hardware and minerals: 1,971,110 yuan. Vehicles and ships: 704,840 yuan. Flax, ramie, etc.: 529,041 yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Miss Wang is the daughter of a wealthy family in the village and has a strong love for fashion. One day, Miss Wang's friend, Ms. So-and-so, told me: "Look!

This can be said to be a kind of punishment suffered for fashion!</p>

<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>Speaking of the two words "Wanli" (ten thousand li), it gives us a sense of grandeur. For example, the Great Wall is so great! In our imagination, a long snake-like city winding continuously will be reflected. And here, I want to talk about a bridge.</p>
<p>Wanli Bridge, this name seems to be heard from time to time, but it is also a very familiar noun in the north. This bridge, in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, is built of stone and is 18 li long. Naturally, calling it Wanli Bridge is to describe its length, and Chinese people are the most fond of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Although the bridge is 18 li long, the river is not necessarily wide, so two-thirds of the bridge is on dry land, like a small mountain. The bridge surface is very wide. On this side, you step on the stone steps and slowly go up, and the bridge also rises little by little. Walking to the top of the bridge, there are four small tea pavilions for pedestrians to rest their feet. Those who are hurrying to get on the road are sweating and panting when they reach the top, which is very exhausting. From this, it can be seen that the length of this bridge is indeed enough to amaze us. Usually, there is nothing that can be used for transportation in this place, only goat carts, but it is very dangerous to ride in this kind of cart.</p>
<p>Based on my shallow knowledge, I feel that there is no bridge in China more magnificent than this Wanli Bridge. Unfortunately, I don't know in which dynasty this bridge was built.</p>

<p>— Hu Xidan</p>
<p>The term "yuanbao" sounds very pleasant, but its shape is quite peculiar. With its two ends raised and its body slanting, people have never considered it a noble item. They look down on it, so its use is merely as an accessory when housewives go to the market. However, it is unwilling to play a humble role. It doesn't hold expensive items like meat and fish; it only carries light items like tofu and small white fish. Housewives also place leftover silver coins and copper coins in it, which shows that it is relatively pampered, although perhaps its constitution is indeed a bit weak. But we should know that it didn't do this kind of work hundreds of years ago! As the saying goes, "Every profession produces its top talent." Its ancestors often accompanied top scholars as the second life for those who went to take the imperial exams. Let me tell you about it:</p>
<p>During the Song dynasty, the court heavily promoted the practice of selecting scholars for advancement through examinations. After the provincial exams were completed, many rushed to the capital to participate in the palace exam. Their luggage and furniture, besides bedding, swords, and examination baskets, mostly included a yuanbao basket with auspicious patterns. It is said that the styles at that time were somewhat pointed, probably to symbolize "rising step by step"! The yuanbao basket's status today is not the same as in the past, so it's no wonder it can't help but feel sentimental about the past. Some people also say that the current yuanbao basket is transformed from the old one, but whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ma Bao <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>The name "Ma Bao" (horse treasure) is quite new to me. It feels unfamiliar and strange. Perhaps most people share the same feeling as I do! After reading the product information for Ma Bao from the San You Industrial Society, I finally understood that it is a precious medicine for treating diseases.</p>
<p>It is said that Ma Bao is produced in the remote border regions, where horses are bred. These horses, in the open wilderness, occasionally eat unique herbs. Their daily feed then no longer digests properly and accumulates in their stomachs. The horses themselves also receive the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers, and the essence of the sun and moon. The accumulated food, through these two layers of blessing, eventually forms a hard substance, neither stone nor bone. This hard substance, as if cursed, blocks the horse's food intake, causing the horse to be neither hungry nor full all day long. During this period, due to the lack of food, the horse's fur gradually thins and falls out, like wet fur, and eventually the horse loses its life.</p>
<p>The quality of Ma Bao is distinguished mainly by its color and weight. It is said that the best quality is pure white, heavy, with little sandy texture, and with a solid core. However, this is not easy for non-experts to discern. Ma Bao is said to be effective in treating spitting blood, phlegm obstruction, and other conditions. Perhaps this is why it is so expensive!</p>
<p>Poor animal—the horse—eats unique herbs, receives the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers, and absorbs the essence, only to lose its life. Yet, we people regard the thing that caused its death (Ma Bao) as a precious medicine. This makes me constantly question and unable to understand!</p>

<p>— (Feifei)</p>
<p>I wish I could transform into a white cloud, floating freely and comfortably in the boundless sky all day long, coming and going as I please, without any restraint. I could travel to the ends of the earth without anyone interfering with me. Not to mention people not daring to interfere, even the moon and the sun couldn't interfere with me.</p>
<p>When happy, I would chase and frolic with the raging tides, or hold hands, jump, and dance. Otherwise, I would flirt with the charming spring flowers or confide in the melancholic autumn moon. Or, I would play with the shy stars in the silent night sky.</p>
<p>When tired, I would casually rest on the peaks of high mountains, looking down and quietly listening to the roaring tides of the ocean.</p>
<p>When unhappy, I would immediately put on a stern face, feel a coldness in my heart, and condense into a torrential rain, washing away the ugly hearts of the world!</p>
<p>Alas! White cloud, white cloud, when will I ever be able to transform into a carefree white cloud? (Response)</p>

<h3 id="e146">A Retrospective of the Shanghai-Gaoqiao Route <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pier of the Shanghai Ferry Company has recently been moved from the Bund on Nanjing Road (commonly known as the Copper Man Pier) to the Bund on Beijing Road. The newly built double-decker pier has set a new record in the history of Chinese architecture, which deserves everyone's attention. The main route of this city ferry is from Shanghai to Gaoqiao—a town in Pudong. It has only been extended to Wusong in the past year or two.</p>
<p>Although Gaoqiao's town diameter is less than three li at its longest point, it is the hometown of the famous contemporary figure Du Yuesheng, and officials often come and go. It also produces many authoritative figures in the construction industry (Pudong has always been famous for producing skilled carpenters and foremen). It can also promote various new facilities in the locality. It is also conveniently located along the Huangpu River, making it suitable as the tail end of Shanghai's crowded residential areas. In addition, in recent years, a seaside bathing beach has been set up on the coast three or four li from the town, which can stimulate the true interest in life for Western expatriates in Shanghai and a group of new figures. —With both outstanding people and a favorable environment, the traffic on that route has naturally made great progress and is still in its ascendant!</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Gaoqiao route has achieved today's success and has a simple history that can be recorded, proving the speed of its progress and reflecting the huge waves of Shanghai's prosperity affecting the areas near Shanghai. It is adapting to the needs and geographical advantages.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, residents of Gaoqiao had to take a sailing boat to Shanghai, which took four or five hours. After more than fifty li of the swaying river journey, it was like the situation two years ago when one had to take a long ferry to go directly from Gaoqiao to Wusong. Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, Gaoqiao people would never go to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Later, in Donggou, about twelve li from Gaoqiao, there was the Donggou Embankment Bureau in the area. Mr. Zhu Futian, the director, pioneered a small steamship line running from Donggou to Shanghai. Most Gaoqiao people then did not hesitate to pay for a rickshaw to take the route through Donggou to catch the steamer, seeking its stability, speed, and convenience.</p>
<p>A year or two later (about twenty years ago), a local gentleman from Gaoqiao, Mr. Sun, independently established the Tongxing Small Steamer Company. He built a pier less than three li from the town, at Tiandengtou, a slight advancement into the Gaoqiao boundary river port. In Shanghai, he still used the Copper Man Pier where Gaoqiao boats had always docked, which was only recently replaced. The small steamer ran six or seven times a day, and one of the trips always towed a sailing boat, carrying heavy goods. The sailing boat was moored on the Pujiang River at the 16th Pier in Nanshi, so that passengers could conveniently handle goods nearby. The direct ferry service from Gaoqiao to Shanghai started from this point. The old-fashioned sailing boats naturally became obsolete.</p>
<p>After Gaoqiao was incorporated into Shanghai Municipality, the city ferry began to operate and also docked at Donggou. The city ferry's Gaoqiao pier was built on the Pujiang River bank—at the furthest point of Tiandengtou, making it even more convenient for the steamer not to enter the port. It fairly allowed the old steamer—now named Heji—to continue operating as usual, retaining its old pier until now. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Madam Zhu Hu said: "I heard it, I heard Mr. Zhang say it several times. You tell me to activate my mind a bit, how do I activate it?" Zhang Jiefu couldn't help but chuckle, thinking that he was originally too honest. With such a muddle-headed woman, he should just speak in riddles with her. How could she understand? He raised his head and thought for a moment, and said with a smile: "Money is very hard to come by, you should know that." Madam Hu said: "Yes! That's what I'm saying too. How can the money be mine if I just activate my mind?" Zhang Jiefu said: "This is not a lie. The reason why this Mr. Jia wants to marry someone is because he is too lonely and wants someone to accompany him. If..." He felt it difficult to continue speaking, and coughed lightly twice. But he needed money just as much as Madam Zhu Hu did. He had his own plan, and this plan had to be helped by Jia Duocai. So, how could he not make this happen? So he encouraged his own courage, looked at Yueying, and then said to Madam Hu: "Since you are already willing to give your daughter to this Mr. Jia." Madam Hu nodded and said: "I'm more than willing to give her to such a rich man!" Zhang Jiefu said: "Then that's easy. You two are willing to give and willing to take, so your daughter will be his family member sooner or later. Why not just..." Saying this, he paused and smiled again. Madam Zhu Hu looked at him with her eyes rolling, still not understanding what he meant. But Miss Yueying understood somewhat. It was definitely not something good to hear, so she frowned and said to Jiefu: "Mr. Zhang, we are all pitiful people and don't understand anything. If you tell us to do something that we can do, we will definitely do it without saying a second word. If we can't do it, please forgive us, Mr. Zhang. How would we dare to say anything?" (149)</p>
<h3 id="e148">Royal Fragrance Drifting Record <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>They were not originally on this yellow train with us. They were loaded onto the second train behind, along with the soldiers. The Empress Dowager was initially very interested in them, but after hearing them a few times, she said she was tired of them. At this time, she had completely forgotten that there was this group of people on the troop train behind. So when Li Lianying came to report this matter to her, she just nodded vaguely and said nothing.</p>
<p>After passing that long line of prostrating officials, the platform ended—they knelt across the entire platform. At that time, Tianjin was not very lively. A little further away from the station, all that could be seen on both sides were earthen mound-like graves and boundless fields. The Empress Dowager was no longer in the mood to lean against the window and gaze idly, and she returned to her throne as before. At this time, the speed of the train gradually increased again. I estimated from the degree of vibration of the vehicles that it was probably running faster now than before arriving in Tianjin. We actually all hoped so. Even the Empress Dowager did not show any dissatisfaction with the increased vibration of the vehicles. It was as if there was some terrible demon chasing us from behind, making us unable to escape. The scenery along the way when we came seemed to have nothing that we did not like to see. Now that we were returning, the scenery was still the same as it was more than ten days ago, but when we saw it, we actually felt some fear.</p>
<p>Our royal train soon arrived at Fengtai. Although there were also many officials kneeling to greet the Holy Presence, the Empress Dowager would not pay attention to them. Li Lianying would certainly not come to report to the Empress Dowager again. There was no reason for the train to slow down again, it just glanced over and passed. But once past Fengtai, Beijing was near. The speed of the train finally gradually decreased, letting it slowly flow towards Yongdingmen. That was where the Empress Dowager boarded the train when she left Beijing. (260)</p>

<p>Shows Skill and Defeats Zhang Yingda</p>
<p>Wins Group A Championship for Three Consecutive Years</p>
<p>Result of the 2nd: 2,000 Points to 1,237</p>
<p>The various competitions organized by the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association, such as Snooker, Group B, and Group A, concluded last night. Mrs. Zhao Zihui presented the awards. Snooker champion Bellman, runner-up Medina, Group B champion Bailey, runner-up Ye Mouzhuo, and Group A champion Li Gongying, runner-up Zhang Yingda, etc., received their awards amidst applause and retired.</p>
<p>Li Gongying's Superb Artistry</p>
<p>Before the awards were presented, Li Gongying and Zhang Yingda played the final two games of the Group A championship. Li had a 222-point lead from the previous day. At the beginning of his turn, he was incredibly smooth, with huge scores of 74, 68, and 101 in succession, widening the gap significantly. When the unprecedented huge score of 140 was produced, Zhang's position became hopeless. At that time, the beauty of Li's self-landing and layout was truly worth seeing. At the end of the third game, Li had 1,500 points and Zhang had 970 points. Zhang still failed to achieve his goal in the last game. After scoring two large scores of 74 and 63, he encountered unfavorable situations with every shot. At that time, the situation was almost entirely controlled by Li. When Li completed the 2,000-point goal, Zhang had only scored 1,237 points, a difference of 763 points. The large scores of the two are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Gongying</p>
<p>74, 68, 101, 140, 32, 24, 22, 64, 65, 81, 35, 77, 34</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of relevant ministries and commissions to revise the standards of weights and measures, as previously reported. The Yuan will soon distribute the details of the meeting and the key points of the reform to relevant agencies and organizations to solicit their opinions. The following is a summary of the detailed review by the Review Committee on the names and definitions of the units in the standards of weights and measures: (A) Participating organizations: Academia Sinica (Ding Xielin), Ministry of Education (Sun Guofeng, Chen Kezhong), Ministry of Industry (Liu Yinfei, Wu Chengluo), Ordnance Administration (Jiang Dashao, Yan Shunzhang), Chinese Physical Society (Hu Gangfu, Yang Zhaozhao), Chinese Institute of Engineers (Yun Zhen). The meeting was chaired by Cen Dezhang of the Executive Yuan, with Ren Shujia as the recorder. (B) Review opinions: Regarding the names of the standards of weights and measures, it was generally agreed that revisions were necessary. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan send the current Weights and Measures Law and the plan proposed by the Physical Society, along with the review opinions of this committee, to relevant government agencies and academic organizations across the country, requesting that they submit their signed opinions before the middle of May, so that the Yuan can convene another review meeting to conduct further research. Regarding the definitions of the standards of weights and measures, it was generally agreed that the regulations for units in the standards of weights and measures should be revised. The main points are as follows: (1) Length and mass should be the basic items of weights and measures. (2) Area, volume (capacity) should be derived items. (3) The meter should be the main unit of length, defined as the distance between the two middle lines at both ends of the original meter bar when the temperature is zero degrees Celsius. (4) The kilogram should be the main unit of mass, defined as the mass of the original kilogram. (5) The square meter should be the unit of area. (6) The cubic meter should be the unit of volume (capacity). (7) The liter should be the applied unit of capacity, defined as the volume occupied by one kilogram of pure water at its maximum density under standard atmospheric pressure. When the required precision does not exceed one part in thirty thousand, one liter can be considered equal to one-thousandth of a cubic meter.</p>

<p>Central Activities to Be Held Regularly</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Follows Instructions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to its affiliated primary schools yesterday, stating: Revolutionary thought and spirit must be cultivated in childhood. The stirring, tragic, and passionate revolutionary events in history should be used to stimulate children's revolutionary emotions and cultivate their revolutionary thought and spirit. In view of this, this bureau has been compiling and selecting supplementary teaching materials for revolutionary memorial days and ordering all schools to adopt them. Now that March 29th is the Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day, the supplementary teaching materials for all primary schools should still follow the old plan and be prepared in advance. The following two books are designated as required supplementary teaching materials for all public and private primary schools on the Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day: (1) The lower grades should uniformly use the self-compiled edition by this bureau. (2) The middle and upper grades should uniformly use the edition published by the Children's Literature and Art Society. The first type, used by the lower grades, should be purchased by each school from this bureau. The second type, used by the middle and upper grades, should be ordered by each school from the Children's Happiness Society at Jinpanfang near Penglai Road in South Shanghai, or the Children's Morning News Society on Shandong Road, so that each student has a copy to facilitate teaching. As for the prices of the books, the self-compiled edition by this bureau will be sold for 3 silver cents per copy, and the edition published by the Children's Literature and Art Society is originally priced at 2 jiao, but this bureau has negotiated with the publisher to reduce the price by half, with a real price of 1 jiao of silver, in order to reduce the burden on children. In order to improve the teaching effectiveness of all schools, this bureau has also designated that from March 25th to 30th, all primary schools should uniformly hold central activities for the Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day. The teaching materials for all subjects and children's activities should be centered on the Huanghuagang Revolution events. In addition to adopting the above designated teaching materials, each school should also formulate detailed plans and implement them conscientiously to achieve significant results. It is hereby ordered that each school comply with the above instructions and report the implementation status to this bureau for review. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>

<p>Gui Shun Gives a Speech, Filipinos Host with Great Hospitality</p>
<p>Guangdong Representatives Dissatisfied with Immigration Law</p>
<p>(Manila Correspondence) During this annual hot carnival season, in order to attract tourists, the 5th Rotary International Conference was also convened in Manila. The representatives of the Xiamen Rotary Club in China were Wang Fuxing, Hong Zhaohuan, Shen Zhizhong, and Ding Xirong. The representatives from Shanghai were Wang Wangting and Mr. and Mrs. Kuang Fuzhuo. Those from Nanjing were Yan Deqing and Mr. and Mrs. Yu Qingsong, and Chen Yuguang (president of Jinling University and president of the Chinese Chemical Society). Lin Fengqi was from Qingdao, Zhu Foling was from Jinan, Mr. and Mrs. Lao Jing'an were from Hangzhou, and Mr. and Mrs. Yang Mianxi and the Luo brothers, Luo Wenhao and Luo Wenjin, were from Hong Kong. They arrived in Manila on the 17th aboard the President Jackson.</p>
<p>Situation: The ship arrived at the dock at 7 o'clock. Representatives of the Philippine Rotary Club (both men and women) and various overseas Chinese community organizations gathered to welcome them. The women wore local costumes, with cicada-wing shirts and floor-length skirts. Their mode of transportation was not modern motorcycles, but the ancient and clumsy horse-drawn carts used to transport goods and people in the Philippine countryside. Their musical instruments were not military music or Westernized elegant music, but bamboo instruments from the primitive era of the Philippines, with a unique antique charm. After leaving the dock, they were taken on a tour of the city before resting briefly at the Manila Hotel. They then took a special express train to Los Baños (two hours by train from Manila) to visit scenic spots. In the evening, they gathered at the Hygiene Lecture Hall. Accommodation was at the discretion of the guests, except for designated locations.</p>
<p>Conference Proceedings: The official opening ceremony was held at 9:30 am on the 18th. The Acting Governor delivered a welcome speech. The Speaker of the Senate delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Filipino people. The Mayor and the President of the Rotary Club also delivered welcome speeches successively. The Secretary of the Conference then announced the purpose of the conference, followed by singing. The Chairman of the Conference delivered a speech, and representatives from various parties delivered speeches. The conference continued after lunch and adjourned at 5:30 pm. In the evening, the Philippine University Club held a dinner party to welcome the guests. All family members of the Rotary Club representatives were invited to participate. A Philippine women's music team provided entertainment. A lecture was held at 9 o'clock, followed by dancing at 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, there was singing at 8 am, followed by a conference at 9 am. Representatives delivered speeches successively. There was a photo session at 11:30 am. After lunch, they took a car to visit scenic spots in Marrati (with a radio station). There was a dinner party at 7:30 pm, followed by a variety show.</p>
<p>On the 20th, there was singing at 9 am, followed by a conference at 10 am. There was a dinner party at the Spanish Association at 12 noon, during which speeches were given. A dance party was held at the Manila Hotel in the evening. At 12 midnight, the representatives took the President Coolidge to leave the Philippines.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: In his welcome speech on behalf of the Philippine nation, the Speaker of the Philippine Senate explained the importance of holding the Rotary Club conference in Manila, and said that the Filipino people were extremely sincere and hospitable. If foreign guests need food and lodging in the countryside, the Filipino people will sincerely welcome them, which proves that the Filipino people are willing to join hands with foreigners by nature. J. M. Henry, a representative from Guangdong, spoke on the value and significance of organizing tourist groups to foreign countries. He mentioned that narrow nationalism has a negative impact on diplomatic relations, and that the Philippine immigration regulations have a discriminatory attitude towards the import restrictions on overseas Chinese. Most members of the Guangdong Rotary Club were unwilling to come to the Philippines to participate in order not to damage the dignity of the country and individuals. Wang Zhengting and representatives from various countries also delivered routine speeches.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Reception: The overseas Chinese gave the representatives from various parts of China a very warm reception. A reception committee was organized, and individuals and various organizations held banquets for the representatives in shifts. The Consulate General and the Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Shanghai stating that a large number of tourist groups from China had left Shanghai on the night of the 19th. They consulted with the Philippine conference and the Carnival Organizing Committee for a grand welcome. (Sent by Yan Wenchou)</p>

In December of the same year, Zhao Yuanren conducted a short-term experiment at the institute, reaching 200 words per minute, demonstrating the speed and agility of the method. Now, for the convenience of comrades in Shanghai who wish to learn, the society has obtained approval from the Ministry of Education to establish a branch institute in Shanghai. The address of the institute is at the Municipal He'an Elementary School on Xinzha Road, and Wang Gongxia will be in charge of opening the class. Wang is the nephew of Wang Yi and has been studying Wang-style shorthand for more than ten years, with extensive experience. Registration has now begun.</p>

<p>The National Jinan University Affiliated High School has a large number of overseas Chinese students, and its management is very conscientious. This semester, due to Principal Shen's busy schedule, he was unable to take care of the position of High School Director. He initially requested Liao Yunpeng to take over. However, Liao declined repeatedly due to his numerous affairs in Shanghai. After Principal Shen repeatedly urged him to stay, he reluctantly agreed to transfer the position to Liu Zhenru, Director of the Department of History and Geography of the university. Liu has been involved in education for many years and has extensive research on secondary education. Zhong Wanru was specially invited to serve as the Director of Academic Affairs. Ms. Zhong graduated from National Sun Yat-sen University and Guangdong Higher Normal School, and has served as the principal of Guangzhou Normal School, the principal of Shantou Municipal Girls' Middle School, the director of the affiliated high school and elementary school of National Sun Yat-sen University, the Director of Moral Education of Guangdong Provincial Girls' Normal School, and a member of the Preparatory Committee of Lingdong University.

Academic literature and artistic literature can be combined, so in practice there are only two types: artistic literature and applied literature. The methods of artistic literature are divided into four types: (1) entrusting objects, (2) leaving words, (3) creating sentences, and (4) using sounds. The methods of applied literature are divided into two types: (1) fairness and fluency, and (2) neatness and conciseness. With extensive evidence and both serious and humorous tones, the audience was moved. The lecture lasted for two hours.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Market Resurgence After Steep Decline; Standard Gold Price Soars</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Extremely Tight; News Brings Abundant Favorable Factors</p>
<p>Official Exchange Rates Repeatedly Reduced; Silver Coinage Drastically Shrinks</p>
<p>Resulting in a Sharp Rise of Thirty-Six Yuan</p>
<p>After the shocking drop in the gold market the day before yesterday, yesterday's market indeed showed a rebound. The foreign exchange market was extraordinarily tight, official exchange rates were repeatedly reduced, silver coinage saw a drastic drop, and coupled with frequent reports of surging prices from the Associated Press, the rebound became violent. Initially in the morning, silver prices in overseas markets rose in both Britain and the United States, and the forward silver price fluctuated, but the actual transactions, after closing, had once retreated from above the listed price of 18.75 to below 0.0625. London's standard gold rose by one shilling and eleven and a half pence. Although the exchange rate fell, the closing price was not reduced by much, which kept people's spirits up. Off-market tentative transactions opened fairly steady, at 22 or 23 yuan. Major players immediately came forward to buy, triggering a buying frenzy, and prices rose to 27 or 28 yuan. Although they once dropped to 24 or 25 yuan, the Central Bank's official rates were announced, and although Britain and the United States rose, the customs gold unit rose by 1.2%, and the standard gold price rose to 929.8 yuan. This caused a high opening in the morning. Immediately after the opening, prices broke through the 30 yuan mark. At this time, supply and demand were uneven, and there was still a pullback. But then Sassoon came forward to bid for shillings, and banks also bought one after another, breaking through 30 yuan again. The rising trend became more intense, the selling atmosphere disappeared, and covering short positions became eager. Before long, prices broke through the 40 yuan mark. Dalian banks and others engaged in hedging activities, taking advantage of the high prices to cover their positions. The foreign exchange market hardened for a time, and prices also fell by more than ten yuan thereafter. Banks took advantage of the low prices to continue bidding, and prices stabilized after falling. When prices broke through the 40 yuan mark for the second time, there was a lack of supply, and the rising trend was escalating. The foreign exchange market became even more extraordinarily tight, and the midday close actually rose to the 50 yuan mark. HSBC's official rates were revised downward. The Associated Press reported that, according to interviews, Mr. Song Ziwen had previously convened experts to discuss how to protect our country's trade, and the pound exchange rate should be suppressed to below one shilling and five pence. As a result, the market rose immediately after the afternoon opening. Soon after, the initial report of the sharp drop in silver coinage stirred up people's hearts. The domestic market was extremely tight, and the rising trend was even stronger, breaking through the 60 yuan mark. Sassoon again covered shillings. Although supply was still plentiful after the rise, prices fell back. However, due to HSBC's official rates being revised down again, there was still a rising trend, but it did not break through the 60 yuan mark. After this, the foreign exchange market eased slightly, and Guangdong banks and others provided some supply, and major players also emerged to sell. There were repeated pullbacks, but people's minds were still stable, and there was quite a bit of struggle. Later, the Associated Press reported that it was said that our country had previously considered a plan of five Chinese currency dollars equaling one US dollar. People's hearts were stirred up again, and prices rushed out of the 60 yuan mark again. After all, these kinds of reports were all past news, and at present, they may no longer be effective. Because of this, the sellers at high prices were very eager, and the pullback was also rapid. Finally, due to the settlement price relationship, prices fell sharply and then rose repeatedly. After the closing, the Da Mei Evening News also had a description of the aforementioned telegrams, and prices rose to above 60 yuan. The market situation of one day was excessively volatile, and it is difficult to be certain about the future. Now, after recording the market situation of one day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 826.5 yuan, a rise of 5.5 yuan compared to the previous close. Huixiang, Hengyu, Dafayong immediately bought, rising to 33 yuan.

Fuan, Qianchangxiang still advanced to 31 yuan. Yuanyi, Yingxiang, Yuanchangyong rushed to sell, retreating to 27 yuan. After entering, it was learned that HSBC's official rates were up 1.25 for the pound and 1.875 for the US dollar. Although it rose, there were many trades. Dafayong, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and Lifeng bought contracts one after another, and prices rose to 33.5 yuan. Dada, Dafayong, Hengyu, and Dacheng took the opportunity to sell, retreating to 1.5 yuan. Sassoon bid for March shillings at 0.25.

At this time, because Yuanmaoyong and others were selling, there was a lot of struggle. Dadecheng sold to 8 yuan. When Zhengjin wanted to bid for May US dollars at 4.375, Huixiang, Fuyu, Wanxing, and Dingkang came to buy, rising to 42 yuan. Fuyu, Wanxing, and Yongli sold off, retreating to 39.5 yuan.

HSBC's official rates were announced, with the pound rising by 0.125 and the US dollar rising by 1.875, with little impact. After entering, Sassoon suddenly came to cover short positions, and banks also repeatedly made settlements, the process gradually tightening. However, due to the hedging activities of Dalian banks, many positions were closed, resulting in a lot of maneuvering. The tightening loosened for a time. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to continue bidding. Finally, due to the lack of supply, the process became extraordinarily tight again. Foreign telegrams brought favorable news, and HSBC's official rates were revised down by 0.25 and 0.5 yuan. As a result, the market was even tighter after the afternoon opening, with the silver coinage plummeting from 19 to 23 anna. Sassoon and HSBC covered their positions at high prices. However, due to HSBC's official rates being revised down again by half a penny and one yuan, there was still maneuvering. After entering, the silver coinage rebounded by 2 anna.

<p>The Money Industry Is Cautious; Interbank Lending Lacks Competition</p>
<p>Still Opens at 9% Interest</p>
<p>Since the silver and money industry began afternoon trading after the Lantern Festival, returning to its original state, all businesses that rely on the financial sector for turnover are eager to the extreme. Unexpectedly, up to now, no money houses have been seen sending notes, and no banks have been seen opening accounts. Knowing that there is no hope, it is difficult for ordinary families with short-term capital to operate. Therefore, cases of declaring liquidation are often heard. The money houses' unavoidable plight of closing their doors is difficult for outsiders to understand. Therefore, the focus has shifted to exceptionally easing money supply, and interbank lending has no competition. The morning and afternoon markets are still at 9% interest. The transaction of the clearinghouse is also rare. The morning market turnover was more than 2.8 million, the new transaction was more than 440,000, the afternoon market turnover was more than 300,000, and the small general meeting transaction was more than 500,000. The market for the "drawing heads and adding water" method, with the money supply being abundant, there was no price to open, and everything was drawn in white. The number of drawings was outwardly very rare. 500,000 banknotes were recovered. 700,000 circulation notes were issued and 400,000 secretly marked notes. The transaction volume of pawned foreign goods was more than 400,000 for redemption and more than 700,000 for new loans. The source of customers was 300,000, with 100,000 for the return. Bank collections and remittances: Foreign banks collected and remitted more than 2.2 million in notes and bills, more than 4.4 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous collections. More than 1.5 million in rice payments were remitted and more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, with 800,000 entering the warehouse. Chinese banks collected and remitted more than 1.78 million in notes and bills, more than 4.34 million in various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous collections, more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, and more than 700,000 in special remittances, with 600,000 leaving the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and remitted more than 1.9 million in notes and bills, more than 2.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous collections, more than 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, and more than 600,000 in special remittances, with 300,000 leaving the warehouse. Money houses collected and remitted more than 28 million in foreign public bills and more than 3.5 million in foreign "drawing heads." Remittances from all routes were more than 400,000 and more than 100,000 were collected in cash. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the city's clearing house on the 5th was 8,344,455.99 silver dollars, including 4,019,502.38 silver dollars and 4,324,953.61 silver dollars.</p>

<p>Public Bonds Suddenly Rise in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>A Consistent Rise of 2.3 to 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Alone, the 23rd Customs Bonds Plummet by 1.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Stock Exchange, the market initially remained swirling and firm, but suddenly turned to a rising trend in the afternoon. The gloomy situation suddenly began to unfold, and the rising trend was quite strong, at a high price that had not been seen in more than a month. Rumors spread that the Central Bank planned to issue circulation notes of 1,000 yuan each, with cash as reserves. It was also said that the bank savings law originally stipulated that the reserve fund should be 40% government bonds and 60% cash, but now it was planned to change it to 60% bonds and 40% cash. With a shift, the active cash increased sharply, and bond trading surged. In addition, the Sino-Japanese issue showed progress. Various news gathered, short sellers gradually covered their positions, and new transactions also saw a sudden development. The market price rose powerfully. However, only the 23rd Customs Bonds fell throughout the day due to the frantic selling of Nos. 47 and 53, showing a clear divergence. It was said that this was because the discount on the 23rd Customs Bonds was high, so they were sold to exchange for other bonds. However, the financial community also closed out, and the decline only stopped at the afternoon close. The future trend is optimistic. Yesterday's progress: In the two morning sessions, most of the bond markets were swirling and firm, with each session slightly better by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. However, the 23rd Customs Bonds fell frantically by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan in both sessions due to the most active selling by Nos. 47 and 53, and Nos. 14, etc., also sold. In the afternoon, the news turned better, and people's hearts were excited. The market suddenly became firm and expensive. Except for the 23rd Customs Bonds continuing to fall slightly by 0.4 yuan, the rest all rose, with the smaller gains being 0.2 to 0.3 yuan and the larger gains being 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. Nos. 21, 33, 38, and 43, etc., were extremely interested in buying, and the various banks were even more enthusiastic at the close, and the market price became stronger, rising again by 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 yuan. The 23rd Customs Bonds initially fell frantically by another 0.7 to 0.8 yuan due to the frantic selling by No. 14. When it was about to close, buying suddenly resumed, raising the price by 0.5 yuan. No. 43 also bought a lot, and the forward market price was established because of this. Nos. 47 and 53 had already stopped selling, and it was expected that there would not be much disturbance in the future. The market price result: Except for the 23rd Customs Bonds falling frantically by 1.5 yuan and 1.8 yuan, the rest all rose, from 0.2 to 0.3 yuan to 1.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 20 million yuan. Now, the comparison table of the rise and fall results is listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>Different Views on Currency Issues</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Almost Stagnant</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 4th), the New York stock market was unusually sluggish, and prices fell slightly. Traders were confused by two different views, as if falling into a fog. The first view was the prospect of currency inflation, which would inevitably lead to a drop in the value of the US dollar in Paris. The second view was that the chairman of the Reconstruction Corporation declared that Roosevelt would never inflate the currency during his tenure. Traders were at a loss and were all watching. The market situation was almost stagnant in the third hour, with only 50,000 shares traded. Subsequently, transactions gradually decreased, but traders were very interested in foreign exchange speculation. The bond market was weak, except for US government bonds. The demand for Treasury bills was extremely strong. This was due to the announcement of the March 15 debt raising plan and the speech by Reconstruction Corporation Chairman Li Zhibo, which stabilized people's minds. Small exchange stocks fell slightly, with a total daily transaction volume of 420,000 shares. Now, the Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Silk Yarn Experiences High Gold Price</p>
<p>The silk yarn market, after an initial decline, began to rise. In reality, it had been falling for several days. Yesterday, the gold market saw wild rises and falls. At the same time, many rumors circulated in the market, all favoring the bulls. As a result, buying activity picked up slightly. Currently, the sales of Sichuan yarn are still robust, but there is also selling as prices rise. According to market rumors, transactions involving Three Grades Yarn are being made.</p>
<p>"Golden Rooster" Brand Improves by 45 Cents</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market showed King and Peace brands stable across all months. However, as the gold market rebounded, prices did not fall, even during the sharp decline the previous day. Therefore, prices could not rise today. By the close, weakness was observed, and market sentiment cooled slightly. All months fell by 45 cents. The afternoon opening saw a sudden surge in tension. Unexpectedly, gold prices rose sharply, peaking at over 860 yuan, boosting morale and increasing buying interest. All months rose by 35 to 70 cents to one yuan. Sales included 1,950 bales of Dafu, 1,650 bales of Ruidai, 700 bales of Daji, 800 bales of Yuandai, 1,000 bales of Hexing, 700 bales of Senkang, 1,300 bales of Changfeng, and 450 bales of Dachang.

<p>The sales of raw silk yarn are still brisk. Statistics show that all guilds purchased a total of 1,400 bales throughout the day. The market situation is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each guild are as follows.</p>
<p>The flower market was stable in the morning but rose in the afternoon due to the sharp rise in gold prices after a decline. Market rumors intensified, stimulating buying activity and pushing up the market. However, sales of raw cotton have not yet fully recovered. This is mainly because, after falling for several days, any slight improvement leads to a more significant rebound.</p>
<p>The Marked Flower Market Rebounds Strongly</p>
<p>The opening of the marked flower market saw mixed gains and losses across all months. However, the gold market's bullish momentum reappeared, and there was a shortage of new sales in the market, creating a tighter situation. By the third closing, signs of weakness reappeared. As a result, all months rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a sudden surge in the market, with buyers flocking in. Gold prices were said to have surpassed the previous high, reaching over 860 yuan, and many speculators rushed to cover their positions. All months rose by 0.35 to 0.45 yuan. However, Japanese merchants did not cover their short positions. Sales included 4,000 dan of Dafu, 2,700 dan of Hexing, 1,600 dan of Suilong, 2,200 dan of Yuandai, 1,300 dan of Changji, 1,900 dan of Junchang, 4,000 dan of Runkang, and 1,500 dan of Hengchang.

<p>The consumption of raw cotton is gradually improving. The Yongan factory is actively purchasing cotton, with sources including 400 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Inflation Difficult to Implement, American Cotton Buyers Resell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened lower due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and unstable gold/pound exchange rates, with all months falling by 3 to 10 pounds. The main sales volume came from purchases made after the gold loan case verdict. Currently, some retail brokers and Southern merchants are also selling due to the stock market downturn. Liverpool merchants are selling distant months, while industry professionals and local operators continue to absorb the sales volume. Subsequently, trading was uneventful on both sides, and prices fluctuated slightly. Today's decline was somewhat influenced by the Power Board's statement that inflation is unlikely. The market closed stable, with spot prices down 5 pounds and futures down 6 to 10 pounds. British cotton remained firm due to the weak gold/pound exchange rate, with spot prices up 6 points and futures up 6-7 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to profit-taking but rebounded due to the smaller decline in the gold/pound exchange rate, with Pingguoer down 0.5 rupees and Aomula and Bailuoxi up 0.25 rupees. Original telegram on the left (telegram dated the 4th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 5th is 247 rupees, down 0.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>

<p>Flour, Wheat, and Bran Follow Exchange Rate Trends</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, prices for imported wheat were quoted lower, with Chicago down about 0.22-0.23 yuan and Canada down about 0.40 yuan. Initial sentiment was flat and weak, with the current month down as much as 0.30 yuan. However, due to tight supplies of finished flour and the need to raise prices, some customers purchased a significant amount, and sentiment quickly turned bullish. For distant months, the rebound in gold prices led to fewer sellers and speculators covering their short positions, stabilizing market sentiment. In the afternoon, the current month saw improved sentiment due to tight supplies of finished flour, while distant months saw strong gains due to a sharp rebound in gold prices, peaking at 60 yuan. As a result, buying activity increased, and speculators eagerly covered their short positions, leading to a strong rally. As a result, the current month rose by 0.0275 yuan, April/May rose by 0.0425 yuan, June rose by 0.045 yuan, July rose by 0.0475 yuan, and August rose by 0.045 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market was priced based on the higher cost of imported wheat, so the market opened with a stable trend. In addition, near-term futures were easily boosted by the poor domestic wheat harvest, while distant months saw fewer sellers and higher prices. In the afternoon, the rebound in the flour market and the sharp rise in gold prices led to temporary short covering, causing a strong rally in the market. Future price movements will continue to depend on exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, March/April rose by 0.10 yuan, and August rose by 0.09 yuan. Spot wheat is scarce, with few deliveries reported.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat: Conditions in the Southwest are poor. Available supply is expected to decrease by 3,364,000 bushels last week. The average of private yield estimates is 49,600,000 bushels. Spot demand is not urgent.</p>
<p>The bran market has seen significant volatility recently due to large fluctuations in the gold market. The previous day, as gold prices fell to the 800 yuan level, Eastern mills lowered their asking prices in line with the exchange rate, reaching as low as 2.55-2.60 yuan. Yesterday, as the exchange rate contracted, initial asking prices were 2.60 yuan, then 2.65 yuan, and finally 2.67 yuan. Inquiries were made to inland merchants, but due to the confused market prices, transactions were not brisk.</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Prices Remain Firm</p>
<p>Imported Rice Gains Traction Inland</p>
<p>Soybeans Also Follow Gold Market</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply for various guilds remained at only a dozen or so firms (totaling nearly 3,000 shi). Sales in the local market were flat, with only the Yantai guild continuing to purchase about 500 packages. Apart from the high-quality thick glutinous rice and thin indica rice that saw some price stability, medium-quality rice was devalued by several cents. Yuan rice also showed a declining trend due to limited outlets. Only the rare Duyang pointed rice had no market due to lack of supply.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, boats continued to arrive from the river, resulting in large stockpiles. Sales of various types of rice were sluggish, causing prices to decline gradually. Currently, each shi of arriving rice is suffering a loss of over one yuan. If prices at the source remain firm, future supplies may become scarce. Prices for high-quality white glutinous rice are down slightly, while medium-quality rice is down by 0.10-0.20 yuan. High-quality thin indica rice is scarce, and prices are firm, while medium-quality rice is down by 0.10 yuan. Yuan rice is down by 0.05-0.06 yuan, and other types of rice are showing a softening trend.</p>
<p>(Imported Rice) With the revival of sales inland, the market suddenly became active. A total of 12,000 packages were sold throughout the day, and 850 tons of recovered futures were also traded. In addition to 3,700-3,800 packages sold locally, the rest were purchased for inland destinations. Although prices did not rise yesterday, sentiment and market atmosphere have both improved. Local merchants purchased 200 packages of Ke Xian rice, and inland merchants purchased 400 packages of broken rice.</p>
<p>(Soybeans) Sentiment was weak in the morning, and trading was stagnant. In the afternoon, due to a strong rebound in marked gold, standard soybeans also showed signs of improvement. Prices for Guide soybeans were 3.65 yuan, and Yingzhou soybeans were 3.62 yuan. The number of transactions was unclear. In the formal market, only 100 packages of Kaisha soybeans were traded at a price of 3.35 yuan, and 800-900 packages of newly arrived Hankou soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 3.45 yuan to 3.35 yuan. The destination was the local market and inland destinations. The market situation continued to decline by 0.04-0.05 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Foreign Firms See No Silk Sales</p>
<p>Recently, gold prices have weakened, foreign exchange rates have risen daily, and the European and American silk markets have been sluggish. Price inquiries from overseas are as much as 80 yuan apart. Therefore, foreign firms have seen no silk sales. Today, only Meiya Silk Factory purchased a total of 60 packages of white filature silk of varying thickness as a token gesture.</p>
<p>Moroccan Tea Sales Slightly Improve</p>
<p>According to industry sources, the Moroccan green tea market has been slightly more active recently. Dunxi Zhenmei green tea has seen the most brisk sales. Needle-shaped and Xiumei varieties have also seen some sales. This is because the import of Japanese green tea, which has been converted into black tea, has decreased in Morocco. However, due to unfavorable exchange rates, European firms are still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards Shanghai's tea stocks, awaiting changes in the situation.</p>

<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a discussion on "Writers and Life." Opinions were divided into three schools: one advocated that writers must participate in life as writers; one advocated that writers must participate in life as ordinary people; and the other believed that the quality of a writer's work had nothing to do with the richness of life, but depended entirely on the richness of the writer's imagination. These three schools can actually be divided into two different principles. The first and second schools recognize that writers must enrich their lives. The third school denies that writers must enrich their lives; that opinion is quite grand and need not be discussed. But which of the first and second schools is correct? We can refer to the words of Guyau for reference.</p>
<p>In his book "Art from a Sociological Standpoint," Guyau has a chapter discussing "The Expression of Individual and Social Life in Art," saying:</p>
<p>"The true artist, rather than qualifying as an artist, should regard events as a member of humanity, a philanthropic person in society. Otherwise, a person carrying this duty (that is, a person who considers himself an artist) is killing his emotions in his heart and taking away the life that is the real foundation of true beauty from his work. "A person who sees nothing but art in his eyes often only perceives what is easily expressed by art in his life itself, and what is easily transferred to the false world. And he tends to abandon other things. Such a person often gradually invades the scope of real life with art. His emotion is often combined with this practical purpose and with his own artistic interest. He no longer feels for the sake of feeling, but feels for the sake of using or transferring his emotion. This is the same as an employee who works in business, whose words and deeds have lost their automatic nature and only know how to respond to things..." (According to my own "poor translation," Dajiang version)</p>
<p>Guyau is an advocate of art that should "express all the forces of life." So he: "Believes that life itself is important." He believes that before using things to express, you must "first feel what you feel." Otherwise, "you only see what can be obtained and captured, what can be expressed; as a result, you are obsessed with the superficial aspects of things. It is confusing nature with the museum." I think this opinion is generally agreeable. Of course, we ordinary people do not have such sublime reveries to talk about the philosophy of life with Guyau. But I always think that no matter who has artistic achievements, it is not as good as having achievements in life. Artistic achievements, in this period, are the greatest tragedy in life; and being able to achieve something in life, in any case, increases the driving force of historical progress.</p>
<p>I think the important thing now is not the writer and life problem. It is how our youth can enrich meaningful lives and how to live seriously. From the perspective of literature and art, it is only with a sincere life that there can be sincere literature and art. We must understand this.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Woven Eyes Beach <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>It was Tao, my former classmate, who knew my thirst for the sea, and tried every means to notify me after deciding the date of the woven-eye sea bath. So two days earlier, I returned to Medan from my aunt's house, gathered my fellow travelers, prepared picnic food on a very bright day, and set off in that big clumsy car.</p>
<p>"I've never been to Woven Eyes," I said to Tao in the car.</p>
<p>Tao patiently told me what kind of place it was. He also said that Woven Eyes is famous for sea bathing. Yes, there are really not many places to play on the huge island of Sumatra. I hoped that the sea of Woven Eyes could satisfy me.</p>
<p>After the car left the city, the road began to curve. On both sides are coconut groves or orchards planted with many different fruit trees. I poked my head out, and Malay villages also appeared, with some shirtless women feeding their livestock. The children shouted loudly when they saw our car approaching. Then it gradually became desolate. After crossing a stone bridge, Tao said that not far ahead was a small town, and asked if everyone wanted to stop and rest for a while. But everyone was eager to bathe, so no one advocated stopping. In this way, the car rushed through the small town and drove straight to its destination.</p>
<p>It takes about two hours to get from Medan to Woven Eyes. However, the beach is half an hour away from Woven Eyes; so, after taking a slight breath in Woven Eyes, we hurried on the road again.</p>
<p>"It's really far!" someone said.</p>
<p>However, precisely because the journey was too long, the joy in everyone's heart was doubled on their faces when they arrived at their destination. The car stopped, and we all jumped down and walked to the beach. Tao meant to eat first and then play; the two female companions were obviously also hungry and immediately expressed their consent. And I, with Xuan and Shun, acted alone. I changed into my swimsuit and jumped into the sea. The sea of Woven Eyes is boundless, rolling up white waves, sometimes crashing onto the beach. Immersed in the salty seawater, with the equatorial noon sun overhead; at this time, everyone forgot the heat and enjoyed everything the sea had to offer. The wind was blowing, and the coconut groves by the sea were roaring. Tao was calling us to eat, so I walked ashore wet and had our picnic under a small pavilion made of palm leaves.</p>
<p>"It's not easy to get together!" Shun said, biting a chicken leg, "We should have a good time today."</p>
<p>Yes, after eating, I rested in the pavilion, while they went back to the sea. This was the time of high tide, and the turbulent sea water rushed towards the beach, majestic and great. "I forgot to bring my camera!" I muttered to myself. I didn't know that Tao had already used his camera to take pictures of his female companions.</p>
<p>"Take one for me too!" I walked over, stood on the beach, and the knee-deep seawater kissed my ankles intimately. Behind me was the vast sea. ...</p>
<p>Now, three years later, I turned out this photo taken at the Woven Eyes beach from the corner of the box, and looking at the faded appearance, I felt that time had passed quickly, and I was much older. Having tasted the bitterness of wandering and the hardships of life, on a slightly old heart, recalling those playful days, I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Memories of a Terrifying Life (Part 1) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>1918 was an unprecedented year of calamity for the people of Anhua and Xinhua counties. From spring to autumn, they endured eight months of terror. Farmers working in the fields were captured by the Northern Warlord army to serve as porters. If they tried to escape, they were shot immediately. If they walked too slowly due to carrying heavy loads, their legs were stabbed with bayonets. At night, these prisoners were locked in a dark room without food or permission to go outside to urinate. Many who dug through the walls to escape were caught and killed, and their tattered clothes were stripped off their corpses by the soldiers to be used as bundles.</p>
<p>Women living by the roadside were rarely spared from rape. Eighty-year-old grandmothers and eleven- or twelve-year-old girls were raped to death in unknown numbers! After looting the homes of the slightly wealthy, they would kill the occupants. The poor had even their sweet potatoes stolen. They fired their guns everywhere they went, looting everything. After looting the cities, they would march in teams with their guns to the countryside for more looting, indiscriminate killing, kidnapping, and arson...</p>
<p>The climax was the bloodbath of Lantian, where corpses piled up like mountains, blood flowed like rivers, and houses were burned to the ground, leaving only cries and a scene of unspeakable tragedy...</p>
<p>The origin of this disaster was as follows:</p>
<p>The Northern Warlord Zhang Jingyao and the Southern Tan Haoming were sworn enemies. In the first Northern and Southern War, the North won and the South lost. As a result, Zhang's army passed through Changsha and went directly to Xinhua and Baoqing. Stationed in Xinhua was the Fifth Regiment, whose commander was Zhang Jingyao's adopted son, named Zhang Jizhong. The soldiers of this regiment were all like bandits, engaging in rape, looting, killing, and arson, so everyone called him the "Rotten Fifth Regiment."</p>
<p>One day, more than twenty soldiers passed through Xieduo Mountain (my hometown, located between Xinhua and Anhua counties, which people traveling between the two counties or from Changsha had to pass through). They ate food and wore straw sandals at a shop without paying. When the shopkeeper asked for payment, they not only refused but drew their bayonets to threaten him, shouting, "Hmph! How dare you ask me for money? Be careful of your dog's life!" With that, they ran away. The shopkeeper was furious and gathered more than twenty people to chase after them. The soldiers raised their guns (luckily, they were guns without bullets). The crowd shouted loudly, and men, women, old, and young all ran out to chase the Northern soldiers. Some threw stones at them, some used kitchen knives to slash at them, and even children were hitting and yelling with small sticks. As a result, in Qingfeng Bridge, several Northern soldiers were beaten to a bloody pulp by the crowd. The crowd was overjoyed, jumping and shouting, "Good job, beat them hard! We will beat these bandits who harm the people to death one by one."</p>
<p>The next day, an order came from the regimental headquarters stating that the incident yesterday was serious. Not only were they to arrest the murderers, but they were also to burn down the entire village of Xieduo Mountain. The shopkeeper who caused the trouble, named Xie Chengkun, was an honest and capable middle-aged man who often visited my family. After receiving this news, he rushed to ask my father to find a way to resolve the situation. My father knew that this matter was too serious, so he had to invite many elders to go to the county to negotiate. At the same time, he led more than two hundred men and women, old and young, into the city to "cry injustice," explaining that yesterday's incident was not the people beating the soldiers, but the soldiers beating the people.</p>
<p>Who knew that once they arrived in the county, my father and all those who went with him were detained. At this time, the entire county was in an uproar. Everyone said that the Northern Warlords were unreasonable. If they did not release the petitioners and withdraw the order to burn down Xieduo Mountain, they would fight to the death. At this time, the bravery of the people of Xieduo Mountain and their iron-clad solidarity had already made the commander of the Rotten Fifth Regiment tremble. Coupled with the petition of 40,000-50,000 people from the entire Xinhua County, he was even more frightened out of his wits. Early the next morning, he released all the arrested people and appointed my father as a "High Advisor" (naturally, the title was completely nonsensical!). My father knew that this was too ridiculous. He was a noble recluse, and now his name was listed in the ranks of the warlords, which was indeed an insult. However, in order to protect the lives of the people in his hometown, he had to endure the humiliation and accept the letter of appointment.</p>
<p>After a period of peace, the farmers all thanked my father, but in fact, this was achieved by their own strength.</p>
<p>The war between the North and the South never stopped. Finally, the Southern army won and the Northern soldiers retreated. Then they remembered the hatred of a month ago. On the 120-li stretch from Xinhua to Anhua, they killed anyone they saw and burned every house they came across. It was early September, and the farmers had harvested their crops, but all the grain locked in the warehouses was burned. The houses became piles of rubble, and those who did not escape could not even find their bones. Those who escaped and returned were filled with sorrow, their wives and children scattered, and they had no desire to live. Several families in Lantian stayed in their houses because they had too many belongings and were afraid of being robbed. Who knew that the fire would come and turn their bones into charcoal. The two sons of Xie Yutongheng (the only shop that delivered messages for my family) were burned to death, each leaving behind a young and beautiful wife who was several months pregnant. When they heard that their husbands had been burned to death, they immediately went to drown themselves in the river, but luckily they were seen and rescued. Later, both of them went blind from crying.</p>

<p>Natural disasters and man-made disasters merged into a black tide of rural bankruptcy,</p>
<p>A Xiang was also one of those washed to Shanghai by this black tide;</p>
<p>At first, she thought, Shanghai was a place made of gold,</p>
<p>From now on, maybe she wouldn't have to cry from cold and hunger anymore</p>
<p>But, who knows, the iron hammer of reality,</p>
<p>Would shatter her dreams all at once! —</p>
<p>Yes, A Xiang also has strength, and A Xiang is also willing to endure hardship;</p>
<p>But can you tell her where the employer is, west or east?</p>
<p>She also sat in a job introduction office for more than a month,</p>
<p>But she wore out her ass and rarely anyone came to ask;</p>
<p>She also ran all over the silk factories and yarn factories,</p>
<p>But either they were reducing workers, or preparing to close down.</p>
<p>Finally, disappointment filled A Xiang's heart,</p>
<p>Several times she intended to throw herself into the Huangpu River;</p>
<p>But she stopped temporarily,</p>
<p>Because she remembered her weak younger brother and old mother in her hometown who were suffering from hunger and cold.</p>

<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The prisoners and the women seemed frightened by the solemn atmosphere and dared not act recklessly for a moment. However, the wheezing sounds from those smoking opium in the bunks, like chewing on rubber candy, seemed to invigorate the intruders.</p>
<p>"Oh my! So, young master Hu is no longer a brigade commander!" A woman with a Guanyin-like face and large buttocks immediately rushed to the bunk! "You're putting on airs." She also spoke in a mixed and awkward Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>Putting down the opium pipe, he embraced the large buttocks around the waist. "We're old friends, come on, darling, play a tune to cheer me up! Let you, along with the 'Red Head' writer, perform a night battle at Ox Head Mountain, to gain some prestige!"</p>
<p>"Pah! Be careful not to twist your mouth!" Pushing him away, the large buttocks stood up again. Looking outside the cave entrance, beside the two drunk men lying on their backs, each had already sat up with two "female comrades." And the drunk men were actually moving their hands and feet, doing something unknown. Only the new literary figure was still shaking his head frequently in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he also got up. The author of "New Literary Grand View" wanted to take a bath. It seemed that his whole body had been dirtied by the air in this room, and he had to scrub it clean with soap. But just as he was about to walk towards the bathroom, a shout came from the bunk.</p>
<p>"Old Guo! Come here! Come here!" The voice was clearly Hu Yiyuan's. "I'll introduce you to a friend, a friend—"</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he turned around. Old Guo entered the bunk.</p>
<p>The scene in the bunk at this time was: a male couple lying horizontally on the bed, and a female couple sitting quietly beside the bed, each stroking the man's legs. Four pairs of dark eyes, like four pairs of silver handcuffs, held Old Guo's limbs stiff.</p>
<p>"Let me introduce you," Hu Yiyuan said, waving his opium pipe, "This is the only writer in Hankou."</p>
<p>"Um!" Upon hearing the word "writer," he couldn't help but feel angry. He himself had written millions of words, but had not yet obtained this title. Now Hu Yiyuan was actually easily placing this laurel on this person's head. It was as if he was demoting himself to a third-rate writer. It was a bit like "mother's something". However, he couldn't do that, he still had to learn from Sakyamuni's obedience. He grunted an "Um".</p>
<p>"Hee—" The man on the other side stood up, took off his bird-shaped hat, and displayed his head under the interplay of the opium lamp and electric light. Smooth and glowing, rosy and slightly milky white, the man nodded as if deliberately showing his admirable head to the new literary figure. He immediately lay back down, and went back to talking his own talk.</p>
<p>"Honestly, there's one more thing—that, that Pacific Hotel side, is waiting for you... I thought, you—even if you don't want this share—this share of fifty yuan a month allowance. What is it really to you? But, but, that is what we newspaper conmen—ah, it's what the people who run the newspaper deserve. After all, we—we are still running such a big newspaper. And you, and you have put in some capital. Some people, humph, usually, usually don't publish the newspaper. Don't publish the newspaper, and when it comes to the end of the month, wanting to get a free salary, then, then overnight, overnight rush to print half a page of fart text, claiming to be, also claiming to be a small newspaper. Fifty yuan—fifty yuan, they still have to take it"!..."</p>

<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia has now lasted for two months, and there is still no proper way to resolve it. It seems that war is probably unavoidable. We don't need to worry about that. In any case, big countries bullying small countries is a matter of course in the current world. There's nothing strange about that. What we want to bring up here is this: An American famous black aviator, Colonel Julian, this time seeing the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia, was aroused by a kind of enthusiasm for protecting his race. He specially led fifteen pilots from New York to Africa on the twenty-second of last month, intending to help Abyssinia and fight against Italy when the conflict is resolved and war begins. According to Julian, Abyssinia is the only surviving empire of black people. If a war breaks out, all black people in the United States are willing to participate in the war to defend this country.</p>
<p>This is obviously a heroic act! Abyssinia is a small country, and Italy is a big country. For a small country like Abyssinia to confront a big country like Italy is like an egg hitting a stone. The success or failure of the war can be predicted in advance. However, Abyssinia refuses to overestimate its own strength and is unwilling to show weakness. It grits its teeth and wants to fight Italy! Abyssinia is fighting for its national dignity. It is excusable to use the country's entire military force to resist a strong enemy out of necessity. What is surprising is that this "black hero" Julian, who lives far away in the United States, could not bear to see Italy being too powerful. He was stirred by his enthusiasm for protecting his race, and specially led fifteen warriors from New York to Africa to prepare to participate in the war, to help the Abyssinian of the same race to resist the Italian of a different race. This is truly a rare and heroic act!</p>
<p>Julian is not a fool. He himself knows that his strength is very weak and is not enough to save Abyssinia. However, he is determined, fearless, and wants to go to the front line to fight against the strong enemy. Why is this? For nothing else, but to protect his race! Because he protects his race, he is willing to sacrifice for his race and disregard life and death!</p>
<p>Only with Julian's ambition can he be called a "national hero!"</p>
<h3 id="e189">Fresh Snow After a First Clearing <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>It had been snowing for several days, and it wasn't that I didn't have the refined interest in searching for plum blossoms in the snow, but unfortunately, the old lady was a particularly strong conversationalist. She specially lit a brazier for me in the study, and from morning to evening accompanied her grandson to chat. Even meals were brought in by Aunt Huang. She said that on snowy days, she often chanted scriptures alone by the brazier. In the past, there was also a pet cat that hid in her arms and pretended to chant scriptures. That feeling was strangely relaxing, but a little lonely. It meant that having guests to chat with for a long time was something she couldn't ask for more. Fortunately, I also had this skill, and could talk about anything in a coherent way, passing the three days of flying heavy snow.</p>
<p>Today, pale yellow sunlight has already crept onto my writing desk. I pushed open the long windows that had been tightly closed for three days. The courtyard was filled with three inches of silver-like snow. Except for the passageway in the middle for going in and out, I took a deep breath of the cold air, and my mind became clear. For recuperating from illness, I think traveling is the best method, because no matter the grass or trees, changing the environment makes everything feel unexpectedly intimate. However, for people like me who exchange our bodies for bread, it is difficult to find this kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I searched out a hiking stick from my luggage and, with the old lady's permission, took her seven-year-old grandson as a companion for my first outing to the countryside.</p>
<p>The sky after the snow had cleared was bright and clean, and the world before my eyes was like a brocade embroidered with silver. Placed in such a scene, walking felt somewhat light and ethereal. My friend's home is a remote, isolated village. After the fresh snow, the road wasn't muddy. The child probably rarely had the opportunity to go out, and he always stayed ten paces ahead of me. As we walked along, I couldn't help but feel a surge of refined poetic inspiration.</p>
<p>However, that was just wishful thinking. It was difficult to recite the works of previous generations, and my own ability to make nonsense was useless. But it was already satisfying enough to randomly string together nonsense rhymes. And many fantasies surged into my heart. If I were riding a donkey and the child were a young servant, wouldn't that be full of poetry even if I couldn't find traces of plum blossoms?</p>
<p>The countryside has many trees, and the bare branches are piled high with thick snow. Occasionally, a few sparrows looking for food would perch on them. The snowflakes that the branches shook off when startled looked like fountains from a distance. —In the hands of a poet,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, it would be like the Yellow River flowing from the sky. However, I am not a poet, and this scenic spot is not found among the famous places in China. Exaggerated descriptions would be seen as the ravings of a madman. To be selfish, Hangzhou, where grass grows in Jiangnan, gathers people from all directions, and you can't find a clean piece of land in West Lake. I hope that this complete piece of land in a remote corner will not suffer that kind of cruel trampling!</p>
<p>Walking windingly along the small path, I was blocked by a clear stream. Peering forward through the dense jungle, it probably doesn't end here. Scenic spots often have the temptation of prominent peaks. However, the child was not a thorough guide, and I was a stranger. When I felt a little tired, I brushed off the snow and sat down on a white stone to rest.</p>
<p>The stream had frozen, and the snow on the north side had not melted. The reeds along the river bank stretched, and the snow layer and the light of the sun formed a spectacular headdress. At this time, I regretted that I had forgotten to bring a camera. Otherwise, I should have let my friends who miss my condition taste my leisurely joy and congratulate me; moreover, this rare opportunity is about to be lost in an instant, although perhaps it provides me with a more unrestrained appearance!</p>
<p>Unintentionally throwing a small stone, three or five wild ducks flew out of the reeds in a panic, without any direction. The nearby snowflakes were all dissolved in the clear stream. I regretted doing something sinful. The wonderful scene that was about to be lost was played by me as a cruel executioner! I couldn't let go of it for a long time, and I no longer had the intention to explore the secrets in front of the jungle! (Random Notes on Rural Life, Part 3)</p>

<p>— Ronin</p>
<p>As soon as the train arrived at Kunshan Station, the pointed pagoda on Kunshan Hill appeared in sight. Walking over the overpass on the tracks, squeezed into the crowd, a stone road was laid out in front of us between the bare trees of winter.</p>
<p>Kunshan City, like all old Chinese cities, is crowded with narrow roads and small houses.</p>
<p>Hiring rickshaws to guide us, we were brought to the tomb of Gui Youguang. A stone tablet and a round mound marked the resting place of this great writer of the Ming Dynasty. The place was desolate and not worth seeing. For us young people, who had no nostalgia, we decided to go elsewhere after a glance.</p>
<p>Only the old tomb gate remains in my memory.</p>
<p>We ate lunch at a restaurant. The four round tables were bustling with excitement, filling up with our group of young people. Young people have active hearts, and they became unrestrained after a few cups of Lao Hua Diao wine. Women often play a role in groups, and rosy cheeks often stir the entire group into a chorus of cheers.</p>
<p>After the meal, we took a car to Ma'anshan. The long stone steps softened our legs, which were used to living on flat ground. When we reached the top of the mountain, everyone couldn't help but take a breath. The wooden fish sounded loudly in the ancient temple, and the monks were chanting scriptures. The abbot placed us in a small meditation hall, but the Zen flavor couldn't contain the wild hearts of these young people, so they started playing the game of drawing lots in front of the Buddha. When a certain gentleman and a certain lady drew the best lots, a burst of cheers celebrating the success of their love was shouted out.</p>
<p>Looking down from the top of the mountain, the entire Kunshan and a vast plain came into view. Like Chairman Lin who toured Kunshan, we also took photos in front of the temple.</p>
<p>We rested at Banyuan Garden. The young people hurriedly carried cameras, hunting for scenery everywhere, capturing them into their lenses. The yellow flowers had withered, and Banyuan Garden couldn't keep our footsteps.</p>
<p>From the Kunshan Library, we retrieved Gu Yanwu's handwriting. We had paid attention to this late Ming Dynasty pragmatist's book on the advantages and disadvantages of prefectures and kingdoms during the national crisis. However, Gu Yanwu had died, and the times were no longer the times of the ancients. Besides being once captured by the camera, the book on the advantages and disadvantages of prefectures and kingdoms probably had little value.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, and we walked back to Kunshan Station on the narrow and rugged stone road. The bare branches were gradually covered with evening smoke, and the station was crowded with figures again.</p>
<p>A certain Mr. carried a duck breast and pastries, and another Mr. joked:</p>
<p>"Wasn't the duck noodles at noon enough?"</p>
<p>"Is it for—?" another Mr. said.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter erupted.</p>
<p>The ladies were so bored waiting for the train that they started playing at the station. They attracted the attention of all the guests, stretching out the necks that had shrunk in winter.</p>
<p>The train started. The fields were ruled by the night. Except for the lights on the train, the surroundings were completely dark.</p>
<p>The bright lights indicated the arrival of Shanghai. After a day of separation, seeing the lights made us feel happy; and the day trip to Kunshan was thrown to the back of our minds.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Notes of a Shell Collector <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>The February wind came rolling like a flywheel; in the fields and on the beaches, a kind of naturally hinted sound was faintly floating; like poetry, like pastoral songs, like the whisper of a six-stringed instrument:</p>
<p>"In the season when the north wind subsides, the wind on the beach has a sweet taste, the ice cubes disappear in the water, but green grass grows on the mud."</p>
<p>The call of spring, like a morning bell, leisurely broke the dreams of the shell collectors who had been hibernating for a winter.</p>
<p>So I got up and cast a surprised glance at the outside world again: the seasons don't know how to lie; really, the ice cubes had disappeared on the water surface, and the wind on the sea no longer had the harsh salty sharpness: the sky was crystal blue, bright, and vast. Two or three seagulls flew up on the beach. The world was quiet, ambiguous, and people's hearts were endlessly open.</p>
<p>I also cast a friendly greeting at the sea, and forgot all the hatred of the dangerous waves of the previous night - the sea is the greatest, it is the sky of the ground, stretching with boundless vastness, and it is difficult for people to measure its end.</p>
<p>I must be grateful that spring has brought us the "Mother Sea" of Xu Cixiang again, and looking at her, we have a younger posture, and green endless waves.</p>
<p>So I faced the sun - the sun that had just appeared on the horizon, took a deep breath of vitality, and began to use my spirit to deal with the waves that were galloping in the arms of the sea - they were like light cavalry in the desert, and like soldiers on the fire line, relentlessly one walking in front of the other, and then swallowing the one in front.</p>
<p>The sumo of the giant waves gave me a new chill.</p>
<p>However, terrifying waves are very common for shell collectors. In order to find some permanent and precious things, in a series of mornings and evenings, they brave the wild and violent tides and fearlessly plunge into the dangerous waves: the body is involuntarily pushed by a kind of great force, and even I don't know where it will be pushed; so: I abandon the world's worries, abandon the vague fate, and put all the instinct of survival on one goal: to pick up those crystal clear shells, in which there is an unknowable existence of a kind of light, a kind of treasure, a kind of dazzling pearl.</p>
<p>It is this kind of great purpose that can make a young shell collector forget the emptiness of the sea, the great power of the tide, and the danger of the waves: let me pick up those bright things; otherwise, let me be swallowed by the waves.</p>
<p>So, long days came and passed; but the shell collector kept fighting the terrifying waves and sucking the salty wind; the heart was terrified, but in this terror, how much kindness and expectation existed?</p>
<p>So one day finally came: in the immeasurable shells, a pearl was shining, dazzling the eyes of the shell collector, and also boiling the moving heart of the shell collector.</p>
<p>Thinking over and over again: "Is it a dream or reality?"</p>
<p>Understood: it is reality; but this reality is: efforts and brave seeds are sown in the ideal.</p>
<p>Even if it is said that the shell collector has the loneliness of a wanderer and the roughness of a fugitive; but I know, clearly know: one day, he will also raise a poetic smile.</p>
<p>In front is the boundless sea, and the rolling waves, but it has long been said that terrifying waves are not unusual for shell collectors. For the achievement of a greater ideal, I finally swam once again to the boundless terrifying waves.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Admonishing Against Smoking"</p>
<p>I advise you all to happily put down your opium pipes, put down your opium pipes and the country will be strong. A sallow and thin face is truly bitter. A bent back and waist is not a good look. You still commit crimes to pick ointment and secretly suck. Think about how urgent the prohibition of smoking is everywhere. It is most wonderful to be happy in Shanghai. Still swallowing clouds and spitting mist happily. Ointment shops have many old brands. The soil is secretly and widely opened. Indeed the world is separated by yin and yang. Although it is good to live without worries now, in the long run, the black fortune will end and the national fortune will prosper. Why not seize this opportunity to harden your heart and say that the prohibition is in the concession. You should see how smoking was handled that day. Several draws were closed, and it was swept away with thunderous force. Even if it is a return to the light to prolong life, it will not last more than three or two years. Think about the old reality of the Republic of China, not the old articles of the previous Qing officials. I advise you all to quickly put down your opium pipes.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Great Bargain"</p>
<p>This year's famine has made everything withered, and the market business is desolate. Goods are piled up like mountains in the store, with various colors shining high. I only see the shop assistants idle to read the newspaper, from morning to night it is really boring. If you expect the business situation in the city to be good, you must hope that the farmers will harvest. If the farmers can have a bumper harvest and the people are happy, the transaction will naturally be lively. If the countryside is going bankrupt, where will the surplus funds come from to buy light silk? Therefore, businessmen have no choice but to think hard and break the boredom. I called a group of drummers to knock loudly on the door. Colorful flags were hung in front of the door, and electric lights shone brightly all night. The big characters clearly show the reduced price, marking the price of the reduced rate. It is true that as soon as you shout loudly, people will respond and rush to compete. Gold, pearls and diamonds are not asked, and rough cloth and foreign yarn are greatly sold. From this one end, we can see the general trend, and the countryside is indeed hungry and barren. If we do not think of a way, we will see a scorched village. What is the point of seeking wealth in the city? It is futile to reduce prices. It is necessary to know that reducing prices is an expedient measure, and the root cause should be treated first. The business will not be desolate when the period is full.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Frenzy of British Car Manufacturers in Producing Sporting Automobiles <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Pay attention to sporting automobiles – this can be said to be true. British car manufacturers, in the past, in terms of society, contributed vehicles solely for transportation purposes, neglecting everything else. They also didn't care about the value of the vehicles that car owners exchanged their money for. However, judging from the current situation, it is clearly different from the past. Each automobile exhibition shows us that the market for sporting automobiles has become unique and the value of the vehicles themselves is improving year by year. In this short article, to say that it can fully introduce the advantages of the 1935 British-made sporting automobiles to readers is certainly impossible. If you want to clearly distinguish between sporting automobiles and phaetons, it's even more difficult. At one time, everyone thought that those with hardtops were not new sporting automobiles. But this principle is now completely inapplicable. Especially since there are many serious dual-purpose sedans here that can have the spirit of sporting automobiles when driving.</p>
<p>Innovation in Manufacturing: If you want to buy an open-top car that isn't a sporting style, it's even more difficult. Although streamlined designs have long been used on non-open-top cars, they have also begun to be used on open-top cars. As for the body of a sporting car, generally speaking, there have been no major reforms compared to the 1934 model from a year ago. All the rain gear is less, and it is more hoped to be improved. Especially in convertibles with real hardtops, some rain gear, after being folded, can block the line of sight. Moreover, when the vehicle is driving, there are various unrestricted noises, and sometimes a piece of cotton cloth will be dragged down. Some new car bodies are heavier. Perhaps many car owners would rather sacrifice one or two miles per hour of speed because the heavier body is more stable when installed on the chassis. Some car factories, regarding the manufacture of car bodies, even for very small cars, now consider having a luggage rack at the rear for long-distance travel or long-distance racing applications. However, regarding this point, it also takes a lot of effort to manufacture. Some people even think that it's better to remove the spare tire than to put the luggage in a covered part.</p>
<p>Improvements in Driving Position: Especially for high-speed and semi-racing new cars, the space occupied by the seats this year has been improved compared to last year. Paying attention to the saying "If you want to drive a car quickly and safely, you should always see the two front wheels, if possible, always see them." Regarding this point, perhaps there are one or two small new cars that still need to be improved, but overall they are more advanced than last year. In addition, we have a method of analyzing new British-made sporting cars, which is based on the honors won in past automobile races. We must admit that there is a new car, the Delage Two-Liter Dolomite, which is a new car manufactured in Britain. When designing it, it was completely designed to be suitable for participating in new-style automobile races as a standard. However, it can also be used for other purposes at ordinary times. The new car has eight cylinders, using double overhead camshafts, driven by the center point of the entire cylinder. It has a good dry sump lubrication system and a beam-supported frame. The center of gravity is very low and it can travel 100 miles per hour. Secondly, there is a three-liter and a half six-cylinder Brough Superior, which is not expensive, but in automobile races, the speed can also reach 100 miles per hour. It is indeed a very beautiful new car. For those that can be used as both sedans or convertibles, the high-quality mixed gold mixed into the raw materials is not in the minority. There are, of course, many new cars from famous British-made sporting car manufacturers this year that will be contributed to us. What is especially noteworthy is the product of the MG factory. As a result of participating in automobile races on the Old Continent in the past, it has won many honors. Here, in various racing cars, we can find the Q-type MG 750cc four-cylinder new car, and the K3 Magna new car, which looks very much like a commercial vehicle. It has also won many honors in the UK. The two new cars mentioned above, in terms of speed, can travel two miles per minute. Other sporting cars include the S-type 750cc MG car, the Magna 1,100cc six-cylinder car, and the N-type 1,287cc six-cylinder Magna new car, etc. The S-type can travel 75 miles per hour, and the N-type can travel 80 miles per hour, both of which have very eye-catching open-top bodies mounted on them.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Large Vehicles: In addition, there is another very prestigious British-made sporting car, the Talbot. On this new car, we can find a centrifugal clutch and an early-selection gearbox. The three-and-a-half-liter new car is manufactured very exquisitely, and the famous "95" and "105" models still have considerable achievements. The Olives 20 horsepower car has also been extremely popular in the past. The 1935 engine, which is 2,762cc, six-cylinder, still uses the multi-valve spring with a leading patent. The front wheels are independently suspended. Because of the excellent chassis, there are special achievements when driving. Among the phaetons, there is also a special achievement, the four-and-a-half-liter Lagonda car. Without increasing the price, the new Le Birt chassis is also an advanced product of engineering among British-made sporting cars that travel 100 miles per hour. The engine is a six-cylinder, 4,467cc SU carburetor two-seater, double ignition. This new car also has a special feature, namely the Clairense traffic jam system. The new three-and-a-half-liter new car is also an innovative product. The selling price is only 695 pounds. The small 1,104cc Le Bor four-cylinder car with double overhead camshafts is still a convertible. The Clifford 1,100cc new car can also be used as a racing car. It has already had significant achievements in the past.</p>
<p>康天寗及其他：Now I will describe the various new cars produced by Connaught. There are two types of Alfa Romeo cars, 19-63 horsepower and 19-76 horsepower, both of which are 2.2-liter, in-line eight-cylinder new cars. Although this new car is similar to the Ferrari giant car that travels 170 miles per hour, it travels very quickly and looks very much like a commercial sporting car. In addition, the appearance is even more beautiful. The streamlined sedan is even more famous. The 76-horsepower new car's engine speed has developed to 4,400 times per minute. It is also a double camshaft, and the engine crank rod has seven bearings. The Bok car, judging from the Olympia Motor Show, has been widely used in recent years. In the "57" model, there is a 33 model new car, which can use the highest gear for driving under any circumstances. It is very fast. Among the Mercedes new cars, there is a two-seater sporting new car equipped with a five-liter in-line eight-cylinder engine. The actual horsepower can reach 160 horsepower at its highest. It is also independently suspended on the front wheels. Most of the other vehicles exhibited at the conference focus on travel rather than sporting, and the 1,300cc rear-engine streamlined chassis is a new product of Mercedes. It has undergone a lot of consideration when manufacturing it.</p>
<p>Side-Valve New Car: In addition, there is also an Italian style, which can occupy a place in sporting cars, that is the QM new car. Perhaps the one using side-valve is this one. The OHV chassis is indeed very popular. The OM brand car is historically famous for using side-valve engines. Silent lubrication, easy acceleration, are all reliable in this six-cylinder engine. Among small cars, British products are better than others and have many characteristics that are praised by overseas countries. In the one-and-a-half-liter new car, there are two types of Flanshana Hiss and Aston Martin. They have both won supreme honors in automobile races. The former especially has special advantages, and the ratio of power and volume is unmatched by any vehicle. Aston Martin is usually low and smooth, very much like a commercial car. Hiss has four-cylinder and six-cylinder types (including the 1,657cc new car). The AM is a 1,496cc four-cylinder car with a camshaft. It especially uses a dry sump and double lubrication. The Lemans and TT types are even better products of this year.</p>
<p>Various Recent Products: The British Salmon, this name, follows Aston Martin. It is an old-fashioned and well-manufactured chassis. The horsepower is only 17-70 horsepower. It is the most fashionable four-seater convertible. The most beautiful 1935-style sporting new car in appearance is the AC Ace. It has six cylinders, 1,900cc, overhead camshaft, and three carburetors. It is a very neat four-seater sporting car. On the body of this new car, there is also a luggage compartment attached. Among Austin cars, the most famous is an improved "65" style sporting new car, equipped with a two-seater 7 horsepower chassis. In addition, there are three British-made new cars that are worth remembering. They are Leland, Delage, and Star. The first one has had amazing achievements in racing competitions in the past. This year, it still maintains this advantage. Among them, there is also a one-and-a-half-liter four-cylinder Lynx four-seater body and a fifteen horsepower MPH two-seater body, which are the neatest vehicles among current sporting cars. The 9-horsepower four-cylinder Imp new car has a short wheelbase. Its reputation is no less than Connaught. The Delage Dolomite car has already been mentioned above. In addition, there is a Crowla four-cylinder or six-cylinder car and a South Cross two-seater new car. The new-style Crowla car has now been increased to 1,232cc. There are two types, the base model and the Weathers model. The camshaft used in the latter is manufactured more specially.</p>
<p>Star's Attention to Convertibles: Star has been improving in the manufacture of sporting cars in recent years. It has now established its position. The 1935 new car includes the Liman 9 horsepower chassis and a Limant speed new car. It has a three-carburetor six-cylinder, one-and-a-half-liter engine. Among the products of the Hillman factory, the new car with the small Treasure four-cylinder, 1,185cc engine can reach a maximum of 70 horsepower.</p>
<p>Mallory's Sporting Car: The Mallory factory also has a very neat sporting new car this year, mounted on the "10-6" chassis. It has a double carburetor, 1.378-liter, six-cylinder engine. The results of the tests on this new car have proven that it is the most comfortable and best-performing new car among convertibles. The high-speed fourteen Zheng Luofer four-seater convertible is even a stunning new car. Its speed is unprecedented. The special seat of the Lyleton new car is curved. Its speed and beautiful appearance are also representative vehicles. In addition to the various sporting cars mentioned above, there are many other famous new cars that have crossed the Atlantic and sold overseas, such as the British-made new-style sporting cars, such as Rolls-Royce, Sunbeam-Talbot, and heavy cars such as the 100-mile-per-hour Trakia, Aston-Martin, Delahaye, Hispano-Suiza, Isotta Fraschini, and Hotchkiss, etc. The small Belilla Fasha car is a typical Italian product. In the past two years, the achievements of this vehicle have already been proven by racing competitions. It is also an overhead valve, 995cc, four-cylinder engine. It moves very smoothly. The fastest time can reach 80 actual horsepower. In short, all 1935-style sporting cars have made amazing progress, which is enough to prove the strong interest of British factories in manufacturing sporting cars.</p>
<p>Our local Hozing Motor Company has now shipped a large batch of 1935-style Oldsmobile cars. They are currently unpacking and assembling them. They will probably be officially displayed in the showroom the day after tomorrow. The picture shows a 1935-style Oldsmobile six-cylinder four-door sedan. The appearance is gorgeous and the interior is spacious. Six people can sit together and feel extremely comfortable. The front and rear seats have been widened. The motor and seats have been moved forward. All passengers are placed between the axles, making them feel more comfortable. As for the knee movements, they have been adopted as standard equipment for new cars.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Calculation Method of Air Resistance During Driving <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>When a car is driving, there is an invisible air resistance that prevents the car body from moving forward. This resistance increases with the speed of the car body. It is enough to reduce the engine's power and is an unavoidable loss in driving. But how big is this resistance? Although engineers from various countries have done many experiments before, such as wind tunnel</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>experiments, etc., the results obtained cannot be accurately demonstrated.</p>
<p>We know that when testing in a wind tunnel, the car body is stationary, while the air is flowing. This is the opposite of the phenomenon during actual driving (during actual driving, the car body moves and the air is stationary). Therefore, the results obtained are not satisfactory. Later, some engineers put the car body on the car floor and isolated it with rollers. When the engine is running, the car body slides backward due to the action of air resistance. In this way, the relationship between air resistance and vehicle speed can be known. But the above methods are only to measure the approximate nature of this air resistance, and cannot absolutely know how much it is.</p>
<p>Until recently, an American engineering society invented an accurate on-site air resistance test. Its theory is very simple and interesting. It completely uses the inertia of objects to measure resistance.</p>
<p>When the car body accelerates forward, the people in the car will feel their bodies leaning forward. Conversely, when braking or decelerating, people's bodies will lean backward. Now, this new air resistance test is based on this principle. During the test, a special pendulum is hung on the side of the car body, allowing it to swing freely back and forth. Next to the pendulum, there is also a semi-circular scale. When the car body accelerates, the pendulum moves backward. When decelerating, it leans forward. The action is very sensitive.</p>
<p>During the test, first accelerate the car body to a certain level so that it does not change. Because of the action of air resistance, tire and engine resistance, the car body gradually slows down. At this time, the passengers in the car will absolutely not notice it, because this deceleration is very small. But this sensitive pendulum immediately shows the degree of deceleration of the car body. In this way, the total resistance on the car body, at any speed, can be read from the pendulum's scale. This scale directly marks the resistance unit of a few pounds per ton, which is very convenient to read.</p>
<p>The results of the test on a very long flat road show that the car body is first accelerated to 54 miles per hour. The scale reads 105 pounds per ton. When the speed is reduced to extremely slow (almost the same as walking) at 45 miles per hour, the table reads a record of 30 pounds (per ton). This record of 30 pounds is actually the pure "rolling resistance" of the wheels.</p>
<p>The record on the scale indicates the mixed resistance of air and wheels. But because the rolling resistance does not change at any speed, subtracting the rolling resistance of 30 pounds from each record will give you the air resistance (per ton). If the total weight of the car body in tons is known, then multiplying this tonnage by the air resistance per ton will give you the total air resistance.</p>
<p>The most accurate formula for calculating air resistance has now been determined by general engineers. For example,</p>
<p>F=KAY2 represents air resistance (per ton). A represents the area in front of the car (square feet).</p>
<p>V represents the speed per hour (miles). K is a constant that varies with the style of the car body. The more streamlined the car body, the smaller the value of K.</p>
<p>From the above formula, K can be read from the pendulum scale. A can be measured directly with a ruler. V can also be read from the speedometer. In this way, the value of K can be calculated very accurately. Its absolute value is roughly between 0.00175 and 0.00187. The following record is the result of a sedan test. The car body is five feet nine inches wide and five feet six inches high. The area in front of the car is twenty-six square feet. The car weighs 1.75 tons.</p>
<p>The most important result of this experiment is the measurement of K. Because after the value of K is measured, the air resistance at any speed can be calculated from the above formula. At the same time, the power lost due to air resistance can also be calculated from the speed and air resistance. This is really the most convenient thing.</p>
<p>According to multiple test results, the ideal value of K should be 0.0019 to 0.002. But because of various reasons, such as the speedometer's inability to be absolutely accurate, etc., the ultimate absolute value of K has not yet been determined. However, within the limits mentioned above, it can be safely used for generally streamlined car bodies now.</p>

<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Since the Hudson Motor Car Company re-employed all its old staff, the manufacturing process has become more thorough and the production volume has increased accordingly. There is now talk of further expansion and recruitment of new staff. Work efficiency can be seen to have increased. The Hudson of 1935 has almost become the focus of attention of people all over the world. Its various astonishing records have made millions of people happy to use Hudson.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the effectiveness of the Terraplane automobile. The Terraplane Essek water car is also popular among the general public. The Terraplane record test is different from other automobile test methods. It is to seek its accuracy. The Terraplane automobile competition regulations formulated by the American Automobile Association Racing Department are unique. Its methods are accurate and without error. This shows that the performance of the Terraplane automobile is different from other automobiles.</p>
<p>The American Automobile Association's Terraplane automobile competition. Two Terraplane automobiles. Six self-stopping watches that have been calibrated by the standard timekeeping department are installed in a uniquely ingenious specialty. They can move or stop at the same time. After the six watches have been started, they are carried to the foot of the mountain. There are three timers there. They are given a running watch at the appropriate starting point for use in timing. The remaining three watches that are running at the same time are carried to the finish line of the competition on the mountain. There are also three timers there holding these three watches. After the car starts, the three watches at the foot of the mountain will stop. When they reach the finish line at the other mountain top, the three records at the finish line will also stop. The average of the three watches on each side is calculated to get two numbers. The difference between these two numbers is the time it takes for the car to travel in the middle. Its accuracy is guaranteed. Hudson automobiles have also had good records several times, and this has been even more comprehensively considered in the products of 1935. This method can be used to check the car's machinery at any time.</p>
<p>The Hudson Motor Car Company was founded in 1909. Among all the historical records of the Hudson Motor Car Company, there is a point about the Hudson automobile being happily used by the general public. According to detailed surveys, it is known that among all the vehicles sold by Hudson automobiles since it started business until now, more than 70 percent of them are still as good as new. These 70 percent of Hudson cars are still running on the market. The records also indicate the names, addresses and detailed usage of the customers who own these 70 percent of Hudsons. This is enough to prove that the products of Hudson automobiles are by no means ordinary automobiles that cannot withstand frequent use.</p>
<p>There is also a detailed report that there are now 1.5 million Hudson car owners in the Americas. The average car driver is satisfied with the effectiveness of the vehicles they have purchased and have used them for a long time. Nowadays, people no longer buy cars based on chance and neglect practicality. They must choose to purchase cars that have effective performance. The Hudson and Terraplane of 1934 have been praised by people. It can be expected that the Hudson and Terraplane of 1935 will be welcomed by people.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(9) Charles Ray's Failed Change of Style</p>
<p>Working at the same studio as Nazimova at the same time was Rudolph Valentino. Besides him, there were also Ramon Novarro, Alice Jerry, Mae Murray, and others.</p>
<p>However, Charles Ray was the most popular male star at the time. He was originally a country boy, and the image he presented to the public on the screen was that of a quiet, shy, and timid young man. His success and popularity stemmed from this very trait. But after achieving success and enjoying fame, he decided to change his style. He wanted to discard his old straw hat, take off his worker's overalls, and put on regular clothes, acting like a social figure. Such changes in style are not uncommon in the history of cinema, but the success or failure of such experiments is extremely important to the future of a star, so we cannot help but discuss it in more detail.</p>
<p>Changing one's style is, at the very least, a risky endeavor. Because audiences are the absolute masters of the film industry, the quality of films and the rise and fall of stars all depend on the psychological support or opposition of the audience. This theory has been proposed before. Now, taking Charles Ray as an example, his success was due to the audience's fondness for his portrayal of a rustic young man, shy and retiring... just as later audiences enjoyed seeing Janet Gaynor's shy and quiet demeanor... If they don't like seeing you play a different style, no matter how tired you feel of your old style, no matter how well you think you can perform after changing your style, it will not be successful.</p>
<p>At that time, Charles Ray did not deeply understand the psychology of the audience, and the dictatorial authority of the audience. He decided to create a great and lasting work. To show his determination, he independently organized a company. He poured all his assets into that company, seriously wanting to bring a famous play (The Courtship of Miles Standish) to the screen. He not only put all his money into that endeavor, but also poured his entire spirit into it.</p>
<p>In order to make the film as accurate as possible, he hired several famous researchers and historians. Although it was a bold endeavor, Charles Ray believed that after future success, it would have indelible value in art. It is true that it had value in art, but when audiences saw Charles Ray wearing Puritan clothes, they were greatly disapproving and jumped up in objection. In this way, they lost the country boy they usually liked to watch, and they also didn't like the new style film.</p>
<p>The failure of this endeavor not only caused Charles Ray to lose the money he had accumulated over the years, but also caused him to lose the sympathy of the audience. Disappointed, he left the screen. After a few years, he joined MGM, wanting to resume his old career, but what he had lost was gone forever. In his new MGM film, he wore a top hat and a tuxedo, looking every bit the socialite. That film, called "Paris," also achieved considerable success, but not because of Charles Ray, but because of a new actress named Joan Crawford. "Paris" became a pivot of metabolism. The old struggled to return, and the new struggled to enter. Returning was not easy, but entering was successful. Now Joan Crawford has become a very popular star, but what about Charles Ray? He has now been reduced to an unknown bit part. The vicissitudes of life are truly felt.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the film industry is mostly tied to the issue of people, and the product of the film industry is nothing more than the personality of people. Once that personality has been recognized by the audience, if an actor wants to change his inherent personality, nine times out of ten he will be hastening his own failure, because the audience's preconceived notions are already unbreakable. Janet Gaynor is a sweet and lovely woman, if she plays a worldly socialite, it will not suit the audience's taste. If Greta Garbo abandoned her mysterious cloak and actually played a lighthearted, humorous role, no matter how talented she was or how well she performed, the result would be a big joke.</p>
<p>Audiences have always been like this. They are still like this now. And they will always insist on their preconceived notions in the future. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Everything About "Resurrection" <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece "Resurrection" has been brought to the screen by Rouben Mamoulian's production studio and distributed by United Artists. It will soon be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater. In order to give readers a better understanding of the author, story, and main characters, I will describe them separately here.</p>
<p>(1) Author's Brief History Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a Russian writer and religious thinker. His works had a considerable impact on the thinking of the modern literary world, not only in Russia, but arguably all over the world. Tolstoy completed three major masterpieces in his life: "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," and "Resurrection." There are countless other works, both long and short, with translations in various countries. In terms of quantity, he can also be called the number one writer in modern literature. His life was a life of striving for the truth, from a life of the flesh to a life of the spirit. It was not until the age of fifty that he began to question life, and a major turning point occurred. The solution he found was in the Gospels of Israel, expressing the beliefs of primitive Christianity. "My Confession" was published because of this distress, and called out for non-resistance, non-property, pan-laborism, and fellow-citizenism, and acted from the standpoint of a religious thinker and social reformer. In his later years, in order to thoroughly change his life, he abandoned his beloved wife and became a monk, but died on the way, at the age of eighty-two.</p>
<p>(2) Story Summary "Resurrection" is a novel written by Tolstoy at the age of seventy, and is one of the three major masterpieces mentioned above. The film is titled "We Live Again Resurrection". The story tells of a prostitute, Maslova, who is suspected of murdering a customer and is detained for public trial. One of the judges in the public trial, Nekhlyudov, is greatly surprised when he sees her, because this woman is Katusha, a maid in his aunt's house. Ten years ago, when he was a young officer, he stayed at his aunt's house and seduced her. She became pregnant as a result, could no longer be a maid, and was abandoned by him, so she fell into prostitution. Nekhlyudov believed that her situation was all caused by him, so he wanted to save her and marry her to atone for his past sins. He went to see her in prison, but she no longer recognized him. Nekhlyudov then tried every means to rescue her, but the crime had already been decided, so he followed a team of prisoners to Siberia. At first, she scolded him, but later, seeing his sincerity, she was moved and gradually regained her original conscience, and did not want to marry him, so as not to hinder his path to happiness. Nekhlyudov also understood her good intentions and no longer pursued the matter. There was a political prisoner, Simonson, who knew that Katusha had changed her mind and wanted to marry her. Katusha was also interested in Simonson, so Nekhlyudov entrusted Katusha to Simonson, and he himself went on to engage in the great cause of saving all people. Tolstoy's final talk about saving society is to promote his great proposition, which in terms of thought, is the so-called Tolstoyism.</p>
<p>(3) Male and Female Leads Russian new star Anna Sten, in her Hollywood debut film "Nana", and her second film is starring in "Resurrection", playing the role of the maid Katusha, not only beautiful and moving, but also able to imitate the actions of her predecessors, playing a Russian peasant girl, full of emotions, and most appropriate. Fredric March's amazing performance in "The Royal Family of Broadway" has already received considerable evaluation, and in "Resurrection", he is the male lead, playing Nekhlyudov. What his achievements will be, we cannot judge before the performance, but in our expectation, he will not disappoint. During the filming of the entire film, the scenery and customs, etc., are all striving to be like real Russia, and have undergone considerable research beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Lianhua's New Film "Femme Fatale" Premieres Today <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>This year, Lianhua Film Company shocked the film industry with its two films "The Highway" and "New Woman". It also raised the banner of "Main Force Vehicles On the Move" and called for twelve major films. Looking at the listed productions, it is enough to show the consolidation and strength of its front, and looking around the film industry, there is almost no match for it. This is further evidenced by the film "Femme Fatale". The film's arguments are precise, alert and powerful, and the beauty lies in the fact that the plot is popular but does not fall into the usual stereotypes. The so-called beauty in the film is not originally a serpent, but unintentionally, often causes all kinds of sins, and its toxicity is even greater than that of a serpent. In this film, Zhang Yi indulges in female lust, abandons his wife and children, and when the spring dream wakes up, he is already bankrupt and his family is destroyed. Although this ending is not caused by himself, it cannot be blamed on the beauty. Zhang Yi uses his heroic personality to play the reckless man in the sea of desire. The scenes of repentance and madness show the maturity of his acting skills, and his great future is generally recognized by those who know him. Chen Yanyan plays the young woman, full of resentment and ends up depressed. Her performance is very vivid. Liang Saizhen's prostitute's movements do not flow into flirtation, but naturally have their touching points, and her steady work is unprecedented. The film's collaboration of the three, the sophisticated performances, and the good results are self-evident. Those who watched it yesterday praised it, which shows that public opinion is in the hearts of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Pre-orders for The Great View of Chinese Movie Stars Begin <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>China's film industry has made significant progress in recent years. The directing techniques and the acting skills of the actors are no longer the same as in the previous period of film. Therefore, domestic films are emerging like a storm, and the screening period has broken the record in film history. In terms of art, it can also compete with famous Western films. Film artists are very popular with the public, and have gained a considerable position in society. Film publications have therefore been produced in large quantities, but there is a lack of reading materials that introduce the entire system of actors. In view of this, Yisheng Publishing House specially invited Chen Jiazhen, a photography expert active in the film industry, to edit "The Great View of Chinese Movie Stars", with pictures as the main body, and all those who appear on the screen are included, and all are specially photographed for this book. There are also rare film photos of historical value that are not seen outside. Most of the photos are taken by Chen himself, using the latest and most novel angles, and arranged and printed with the noblest paper materials. Its perfect results can be predicted, and pre-orders will begin soon.</p>

<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Produced by British Gaumont... Starring George Arliss</p>
<p>In the spring of 1815, peace returned to the European continent. The God of War stood high in the sky, overlooking the scarred earth, soaked in the blood of the men who had fought for twenty years. Now the sun and moon were shining again, and the five grains were growing again. The people were showing a bustling sound of coming and going, and the God of War could not help but snorted fiercely from his nose. He frowned and waited impatiently for his opportunity to spew out the fierce flames of destruction from his mouth to the human world again.</p>
<p>On the small island of Elba, south of the Italian coast, a man was standing on the rocky seashore, gazing sadly at the junction of the water and sky to the north, vaguely seeing his French homeland. He was Napoleon, the hero of the world. The angry tide hit the stones under his feet in waves, telling him that he had wings but could not fly. The eagle in the sky of the past was now in a cage.</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte! For twenty years, his name had spread everywhere with the iron hooves of the army, and had been filled with the death and destruction of the dirge, and filled the world. He fought the world alone, and that world had once been in his grasp, but now that world, and all the enemies who combined to fight against him, had defeated him, imprisoned him, and exiled him to a small island in the Mediterranean Sea, letting him live and die on his own. He was that peace, how short-lived was that peace! The man standing on the seashore, although small in stature, had a heart of ambition that could not be caged like a beast. Moreover, his hometown was in sight, and his prestige had not completely disappeared. So after a few weeks...</p>
<p>In the palace of Vienna, the monarchs and dignitaries of various countries, a group of victors, were gathered to discuss how to divide the rich fruits of this victory. They were clamoring and fighting, and telling lies to deceive people, always wanting to get more than others. The King of Prussia was there, arrogant and tyrannical. He and the Austrian strategist Metternich, a gentle, polite, intelligent, and deeply prejudiced man, sat at one end of the conference table. There was also the French diplomat Talleyrand, who had once served as Napoleon's powerful minister, but now represented the Bourbon family, who had returned to the throne of France, at this historically famous Vienna Congress.</p>
<p>However, there was one person who did not clamor and roar like others. He sat quietly to one side, stretching out his legs comfortably, with a contemptuous smile on his face. That was the Duke of Wellington, who had led the allied forces to defeat Napoleon and help the Bourbon family to the throne. His reason for restoring the Bourbon family to the throne was not out of any preference for the Bourbon family. He felt that this was the only way to preserve the peace of Europe. As for the competition and greed of the people at the conference table, he felt it was extremely meaningless. His only task was to preserve the peace of Europe. The stability and prosperity of Europe was the happiness and satisfaction of England.</p>
<p>He sat quietly, lost in thought, but his thoughts were not on the clamoring and roaring of the King of Prussia, nor on Metternich's eloquent talk. What he was thinking about was outside the borders of Austria, surrounding the royal palace of Paris, France, sitting on the throne, was a fat, clumsy, and obsessed with the ancient ideas of royal power. But what he was thinking about was not Louis XVIII himself; next to that foolish and self-righteous monarch stood a woman, she was a beautiful woman, and her demeanor had once been the model of the French court. This woman, like so many women before her, wanted to manipulate the king and secretly become the master of France. (To be continued)</p>
