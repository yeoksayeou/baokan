<p>— 母</p>
<p>國家之法律。原以增進人民之福利為主旨。故凡利於民之法律興之。害於民之法律革之。我國修訂法律。始於淸末。迄今三十年。而人民尚少得到法律之實惠。是以論政者力謀所以改善之道。將以薪乎法治也。</p>
<p>最近頒布之刑法刑事訴訟法及民事訴訟法。俱已於昨日施行。此次法律之改革。共最要之點。在四級三審制之改為三級三審制。蓋以法院祗有三級。而虛四級等於具文。曾不若直捷了當改為三級耳。此則循名核實。無可非議。顧法律之眞精神。恒寄託於眞能守法。且能活用法律之人。又一法律之施行。動關乎一切行政。與夫各種設備。我國法律雖未完備。若能切實施行。未嘗不可收幾許效果。然自來所獲效果。乃微乎其微。此由於法律之未盡適宜者猶細。而執法者未能深體立法者之眞旨。其關係實大焉。</p>
<p>試言刑法。保安處分。乃為注重社會之防衛。而於刑事政策上。師法各國新制而則效之者。第保安處分。不能無相當之設備。例如感化敎育機關。現尚多未籌設。實施新刑法後。設或法官依法處斷。受此保安處分之刑事犯。將安從而執行。安從而威化。他若酗酒犯罪。復將向何處移送執行。此亟宜為之佈置。期收感化之實效。蘄合保安之眞旨也。</p>
<p>次言刑事訴訟法。其於人權保障深加注意者。卽嚴限司法警察機關移送人犯。改為二十四小時以內。對覊押人犯量加限制。及自訴之擴張範圍。夫警察機關逮捕人犯長期覊押。誠有流弊。然有歸入偵緝之事。亦不能絕對脫離警察機關。故嚴限移送之餘。仍應注意警察機關平日辦事之何若。至自訴之擴大範圍。亦不能謂絕無流弊。如上海特區。自訴原不以初級及親吿為限。因而常有借端興訟。意圖敲詐。一旦所計得遂。卽行撤回者。今於自訴雖不能任便撤回。此祇限於消極方面。竊以刑事之所苦者為被吿。被吿之所最苦者為覊押。體面人士一旦禁入囹圄。卽使將來案得大白。而目前之喫虧。已百身莫贖。且一經道塗喧傳。某某為刑事被吿。則不論有罪無罪。其人之信譽已喪失泰半矣。現旣擴大自訴範圍。一般好訟之徒。難保不濫行自訴。是宜於刑訴法第三百十八條規定「於第一次審判期日前。訊問自訴人及被吿」一點。多加注意。尤其於情節奇離之案。嚴鞫自訴人。使無理者不得藉端興訟。而於被吿。其非顯有罪責者。不必覊押交保。以免精神上之痛苦。</p>
<p>次言民事訴訟法。該法於訴訟之進行。力杜故意延滯。於調解則先在起訴前實行。旣不延誤案件之進行。又予人民以和息機會。他若多用假執行。限制第三審。要皆旨在求訟案之速結。是則延累之苦可去其什五六矣。顧有一點須望注意者。簡易案件規定為八百元。三審上訴。須逾五百元之利益。又可以命令减為三百元。或增至一千元。則簡易案件之第一審。尤應將其曲直是非。窮加研鞫。庶無理由者不必故意拖延。希圖徼倖。庶使此次新布法律之精神。得以充分發揮。而人民亦可實受其益也。</p>
<p>綜前所舉。此次法律之改革。不可謂無進步。惟重要之點。端在奉行法律之人。語曰「有治人。無治法。」吾不敢謂法律無效用。第不得其人。法律之精神亦可以沒却。法律之條文。甚或亦可為其玩弄。世俗澆漓。人心險詐。操予奪人民生命自由財產名譽之權者。允宜淬厲精神。公正不阿。而於過渡時代新法施行之初。為犯罪而情有可恕者多予矜全。若是則法治之效。庶可得面成也。</p>

<p>「劉主席·各位同志、今天我們在此地舉行第四次總理紀念週、也是兄弟在成都公開講說的第四次、現在我先將前三次講話的要義大概重述一下、大家應該切實省察一下、第一次所講的是說兄弟這次來到四川的任務、不是專為督勦赤匪、而是吿訴我們四川各界一般負責的領袖、今後應該如何振奮自强、盡忠職責、一方面要使川省民衆都能够盡到他們各個人的責任、使政治軍隊社會各方而能够一天天的進步、並且具體的提出「公」「誠」「樸」「拙」「嚴」五字忠告各位、以為振拔人心、轉移風氣、行政治軍、建川救國之基本要道、今後四川的治亂與國家的存亡、其關鍵即完全在此、大家必須準此力行、才可以完成我們的使命、達到革命的目的、第二次所講的就是吿訴各界領袖知道勦匪一定要本「三分軍事、七分政治」的原則、充分發揮政治的力量、要發揮政治的力量、又必須發揮民衆的力量、如果大家能够照此努力做去、任他赤匪的力量怎麼大、我們也不難消滅也、所以不僅軍隊每到一處、應該愛護民衆、加緊組織民衆、訓練民衆、就是各界民衆領袖、也格外要負起這個責任、所謂「用兵不如用民、敎民要如敎兵」的道理、無論勦匪禦侮、治國平天下、都應當如此、因為民衆的人數旣多、並且到處都有、只要我們加以組織與訓練、便可以發揮最大的力量、而且利用起來也比軍隊便利得多、但是用民必先救民、而訓練民衆、又須如訓練軍隊一樣、使他們都能够和我們同生死共患難、盡其心力、來做勦匪禦侮的工作、第三次所講的、就是說各界領袖個個人都負有敎育的責任、因為我們要振拔人心、轉移風氣、使社會上全體國民人人能够德備術修、成功立業、而達到革命救國的目的、必須注重實施文武合一的敎育、文學校的敎育要以武藝為其主要的基礎、軍隊的敎育、亦要以文事為其重要的內容、務使每個國民、成功文武兼備的全才、尤其是武藝敎育、在今日國家危急之際、更見重要、如果國民不懂武藝、便不是救國的敎育、所以要做現代的國民、一定要有武藝的修養、要使敎育產生效果、一定要有武藝的訓練、而且武藝敎育、不僅注重武術、尤須涵養「智·信·仁·勇·嚴·」之武德、至於一般敎育、又應以「六藝」為其主要內容、如此才成功合一的敎育、惟有這種敎育、才可以救國、以前三次所講的話、都是剿匪治川革命救國的根本要道、亦即各位做領袖做官長做敎師最緊要的道理、各位詳細省察一下、在這三週以來、是否實心實力照着做了、今天對各位再繼續講敎育人民和轉移風尚的要點、希望各位特別注意、大家要知道敎育是什麼、就是敎人做人與成功事業的手段、如果一個國家或一個社會沒有好的敎育、就無山造成完善的人才、和優良的風習文化、也無從建設新的社會和强盛的國家、我們現在要轉移風氣、健全國民、建設新的社會、挽救危亡的國家、就必須注重國民的敎育、教育之道、除上次所講文武合一應該切實做到以外、各界負敎育責任的領袖、無論是文的武的定要明白國民敎育的整個關係、最要緊的就是要知道與民的關係何在、我們無論是當兵的、或是做百姓的、同是一個人、為什麼一個呌做兵、一個呌做民、是不是因為一個人戴了軍帽穿了軍衣拿了槍便呌做兵、否則便呌做民呢、這不過形式上的一點分別、其實兵與民原為一體、并沒有絕對的差異、任何一個人、都可以當兵、任何一個兵、都是百姓、我國古時、寓兵於農、當國家有事的時候、人人有當兵的義務、國家承平的時候、人人便解甲歸田、可見兵即民民即兵、更無所謂兵與民之別、兵民旣為一體、則所施的敎育、當然也應該一樣、不過一倘人一旦當了兵、他所負的責任、使比較普通一般國民的責任格外重、惟其責任比較重、所以一定要德術較優的國民、才能夠當兵、由此可見兵的教育一定高出於普通一般國民、而普通一般國民、實又為兵之所自出、所以我常常講良民為良兵的基礎、良兵為良民的模範、如果一個國家沒有好的百姓、一定不會有好的兵、沒有好的兵、當然不為組成健全的軍隊、必須有好的百姓、才可以產生出好的軍隊來、同時因為當兵的人、既然比較一般百姓所負的責任重、他的人格與智能以及「國爾忘家」「公爾忘私」「見義勇為」的犧牲精神、當然也應該高出普通百姓一等、所以當兵的人、應該是普通言姓的模範、如是士兵及整個軍隊眞是這樣好、當然可以給一般百姓都可以直接間接在有形無形之中受到好的影響、和我們軍隊士兵一樣有高尚的人格、有全善的智能、有急公好義的精神、來和我們軍隊共同奮鬥、完成救亡復興的事業、所以我們要想眞正能練出好的兵來、使我們國家能趨强盛、一定先要設法將全國國民敎好、使之成為優良的現代國民、但是能收得這個速效、除各界民衆領袖用敎育方法努力去訓練以外、同時必須軍隊負起這個責任、（未完）</p>

<p>雷文於昨午尙未能繳呈保單字林報云、美豐銀行淸理員賀甫氏上星期六日（六月二十九）訴請駐華美國法院、論令前美豐銀行總理·兼美東銀公司·普益地產公司·普益銀公司·總理雷文氏、立即交還銀十三萬五千兩、賀甫氏昨日（星期日）語人曰、余之起訴雷文氏、蓋欲收還此十三萬五千兩、用於債權人耳、賀甫氏又在星期六日午夜前、申請美法院下諭、阻止雷文氏離華、因聞雷文氏希圖怱遽離開中華民國、而脫離美法院之管轄也、當由美法院首席法官希爾米克氏簽准、並令雷文氏繳保二萬美元、</p>
<p>星期日午後六時、自美法院執行吏福貝爾處探悉、雷文氏尙未以保金繳入法院、惟據福氏聲稱、本日為星期日、雷文氏當然不易籌得所需之保金、渠决予雷文氏於星期一日繳入之機會、故不即取嚴峻行動以對付之、本夜將由副執行吏彼得森氏、寓虹橋路五五五號雷文氏宅中云、查一九三二年一月十三日、美豐銀行董事會曾通過决議案如下、</p>
<p>茲因美豐銀行總理經理兼發起人雷文氏、任職已久、服務忠懇、向不取薪、或其他報酬、特决議贈以名譽金十三萬五千兩、以酬其忠誠之勞績、並决議命司庫員、即以此欵全數付與雷文氏、而在六年或少於六年之時期內、自本公司簿記中、批銷此欵、一九三二年、應批銷三萬五千兩、餘欵視本公司在此時期內所獲凈利之多寡、斟酌情形、於任何年批銷之、</p>
<p>據賀夫氏接見新聞訪員聲稱、就通過之决議案措詞觀之、美豐銀行當時之內容、業已空虛、吾人須注意十三萬五千兩立即交付雷文氏、並該欵分六年自銀行籌記中批銷、及該銀行當時不欠雷文氏分文之諸事實、凡此皆足證明該銀行當時內容業已空虛、渠意雷文氏必深知此情也、賀甫氏又謂美豐銀行董事會通過贈雷文氏現欵十三萬五千兩時、美東銀公司普益地產公司亦以同數之贈金付與雷文氏、在最近之將來、美東銀公司與普益地產公司、亦將因此起訴雷文氏、尙有一事、亦須注意者、美豐銀行原在美國康苪蒂克特州註册時、係以同名之貿易公司呈請、迨在上海開辦時、乃營銀行事業、賀甫氏又謂、普</p>

<p>本市最近一星期來、晴雨不常、各處農作物、如禾棉等霑水已足、鄉農正在渴望放晴、不料昨晨零點三十分時、又降大雨、點如拳大、勢若傾盆、一時華租界各處馬路兩旁、緣積水不及洩瀉、竟成江河、二時後雨勢雖較小、然仍時下陣雨、直至中午、雨點未停、至下午一時許始止、茲將各方情况、分誌如次、</p>
<p>閘北一帶　旱橋·虬江路·永興路·育嬰堂路·中興路·一帶馬路兩旁、低窪處皆積水成渠、各店鋪門口、均用牌門板等穿跳渡水、錫金公所前後左右低田、及共和新路全皖會館後背、滬太路陸家宅附近、太陽廟路嘉郡會館後、太陽廟鐵路南、大統路西首空地等、因地勢較低、遙望之則一片汪洋、而各處石子馬路、如中興路·共和新路·永興路·等、皆洗刷一淸矣、</p>

<p>本年雨量　今年一月一日至六月三十日止、本市附近所得雨量、已達七二四公厘、（二八零五英寸）較去年同時期四零零·八公厘、（一五·七八英寸）多三一三·二公厘、達三分之二弱、况昨夜十二時至今晨九時、又得五六·九公厘、（二·二四英寸）</p>

<p>昨日上下米麥、麵粉益銀公司之地位、殊不堪設想、恐難付出分文、至於美東銀公司、雖牽涉金錢若干、但此欵是否屬渠、今殊難言、渠現正盡力以保護債權人與存欵者之利益、查帳員伏爾特在其指導之下、不辭勞瘁、終日工作、良堪欽佩、惟目下尙有許多工作未了、渠所申請於美法院者、為諭令被吿以現欵十八萬八千八百八十一元一角八分交與原吿、此即等於規元十三萬五千兩、外加自一九三二年一月十三日起至還欵日止六厘息金之總數、此案終須開審、但首席法官希爾米克氏、於星期六日、令被吿繳呈保金後、即於翌日午後赴北平辦案、且尙須至津一行、故大約須在兩星期後、始能返滬、辦理本案也、</p>

<p>大美晚報云、雷文氏至今日（星期一日）正午、猶未覓得美法院所需美金二萬元之保單、或現金、今晨電文氏曾謁見美法院執行吏福貝爾氏、與之討論一切、雷文氏自上星期六夜起、即由美法院執行吏之代表監視行動、如至下午某時、仍不能覓得保人、或現欵、則今夜須在厦門路西牢就寢矣、</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>行禮如儀後、首由蔡洽君報告云、本年為學生國貨年、中華國產廠商聯合會、為貫澈提倡國貨宗旨、故發起第二届國貨展覽會、俾市民能一致愛用洋貨之心理、蓋當今吾國救國之道、舍提倡國貨之外、更應抵制外貨之傾銷、若僅提倡國貨、而不將外貨之漏巵社塞、則其成績當能意想、滬北自一二八後、工商凋敝、迄未恢復、故須提倡國貨以資振興實業、藉挽當前危運、尙盼各界多多協助、俾收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>演說升旗</p>
<p>旋由劉仲英演說、吾國國貨之提倡、今茲三載矣、而其效果幾等於零、每年之漏巵、均在數萬萬以上、考其原因、不外提倡者之不能身體力行、僅能於開會時唱高調、呼口號、而一般國人、又多惟洋是尙、致成此矛盾之狀態、今年為學生園貨年、學生本身、少數巳能國貨化、廠商聯合會因恐此國貨年仍成過去之現象、故特發起二屆國展、盼滬北同胞、能體此旨、旋即由劉仲英升旗、</p>
<p>商塲開放</p>
<p>該會附設之臨時商塲參加之國貨廠商、原定昨日下午同時開放、因連日霉雨不休、建築不及、致改期今日開放、該會昨通吿各廠、準每日上午九時開放、至下午九時為止、所有參加廠商、應用該會印就之發票、辦事人員、均須佩掛該會會員證案、以昭一律、而資識別、該項發票證章、均由該會照價發售、至各廠所售貨品、完全以國貨為標準、如有發現非國貨、須照章嚴懲云、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3 id="c183">本屆全運籌委會公布　田徑全能新規則提要　競走表演女子擲田壘球規則亦公布 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>第六屆全國運動大會籌備委員會、昨發出第二號通告、中有田徑全能競走女子擲壘球等之新規則提要、普有各單位註冊時應行注意之點等等、錄之如次、</p>
<p>田徑全能新規則提要</p>
<p>田徑賽及全能運動規則、國際體育協會已略有修改、又女子擲壘球規則、本會田徑賽規則中向付缺如、現與新規則一併列入、說明如下、</p>
<p>（甲）計時方法之修改　徑賽計時、凡不滿一秒之尾數、先前規定二百五十公尺以下之距離、用十分之一秒計算、二百五十公尺以上者、用五分之一秒計算、茲經國際體育協會議決、凡徑賽距離在一千公尺以下者、其不滿一秒之尾數、用十分之一計算、在一千公尺以上者、用五分之一計算、</p>
<p>（乙）跳欄規則之修改　第三十八章一百十公尺跳欄第六條後新添註解全文如下、</p>
<p>（註）如採用新式欄架、應按下列條文施行、</p>
<p>運動員之將欄架撞倒一架或一架以上者、並不取消資格、且得承認其所得成績為正式記錄、按一九三四年國際體育協會在瑞典京城司篤克好姆會議議決、在一九三六年終了前、新舊各色之欄架均可應用、一九三六年在德國柏林舉行之世界運動會、將用新式之欄架、（四百公尺跳欄同上）</p>
<p>又第五十三章另添新式欄架之構造一節、全文如下、</p>
<p>欄架用本料或金屬製造、有底座及柱各二、支於一長方形框、框身得用橫檔一個或數個、以求堅固、柱各裝置於底座之一端、欄之高低可任意升降、但須設法可停住於各種高度處、欄之結構、以用三·六公斤（八磅）以上之重力、加於欄之　板中央時、始能將欄翻倒為合法、頂　漆黑白相間之斜條紋、</p>
<p>高度、欄之高度、詳規則中、欄架　一·二〇公尺（三呎十一吋）底座長七十公分（二十七時半）、欄每架重量、至少十公斤（二二·二二磅）、</p>
<p>置法、欄架之置放、應以底座裝柱之一端、置於前方、即距終點較近之一面、而以底座之空端、向起點一面置放、</p>
<p>（丙）擲壘球規則　又田徑規則新添第六十章擲壘球一章、全文如下、</p>
<p>第一條、壘球應從拋擲綫後擲出、拋擲綫之構造、與擲標槍同、</p>
<p>第二條、壘球之直徑為三〇公分（十二時）、擲壘球當從肩上用單手拋擲、從身旁或斜方擲出者無效、</p>
<p>第三條、擲壘球時、不得用足觸及拋擲綫、</p>
<p>第四條、球未落地前、運動員不得越出拋擲綫、</p>
<p>第五條、遠度之丈量、應從球着地之最近點、成直角量至拋擲綫或其延長綫之內邊、（註）裁判員為易判別落點起見、得令運動員在拋擲前在球上略塗石灰、</p>
<p>第六條、第三十二章各條之與本章有關者均適用之、</p>
<p>（丁）十項五項記分表之修改</p>
<p>項運動及五項運動記分表、舊有者因檢查時有加減計算等等麻煩、現由芬蘭體育會另行擬訂、經一九三四年國際體育協會在瑞典京城司篤克好姆開會議決採用、該表應用範圍較廣、任何成績應給之分數、一查便得、無須加減計算、時間心力、兩感減省、且可免分數錯誤之弊、此外該記分表猶有一優點、即給分之水準、較舊有者為低、故成績較差之項目、不致無分、而使選手感覺失望、此項新記分表、已印入大會田徑賽規則、當於七月中旬、分寄各單位採用、</p>
<p>競走表演距離及規則</p>
<p>（甲）距離</p>
<p>本屆大會之競走表演比賽、其距離暫定為五萬公尺及三萬公尺兩種、分兩日比賽、均在馬路舉行、惟起點與終點、均在田徑賽場內、其路綫待測量後、再行繪圖公告、</p>
<p>（乙）規則</p>
<p>（定議）運動員行進時、雙足前後跨步、交互與地面相接觸、不使同時離地、是謂競走、亦即與賽跑之大別、故競走之規則、僅極簡單之二條、（一）任何一足向前跨步、足跟着地時、膝節必須挺置、不得彎曲、（二）其在後方之一足、必待前方之一足着地後、始得提起向前跨步、（例如左足前跨、着地時膝節必須挺直、此為合法走步之必然結果、迨左足已經與地面接觸、然後方可將有足提起再向前跨步、若左足尚未着地、而急於將右足提起、全身自然騰空、即為跑步、與競走定義不符、而成犯規、）</p>
<p>第一條、運動員在競走比賽進程中、裁判員如認其走法有　　犯規之處、而尚未成立犯規者、得先予以警告、</p>
<p>第二條、運動員在競走比賽進程中、有裁判員二人均認其走法與競走之定義不合者、應即取消其資格、並由該裁判員二人中之任何一人、向該犯規之運動員作正式之通知、如事實上對於因犯規而被取消資格之運動員、無法早為通知時、得待比賽完畢時隨即補予執行、其效力與在犯規發生時通知者同、</p>
<p>第三條、比賽之在跑道上舉行者、運動員被通知取消資格時、應立即離開跑道、比賽之在馬路上舉行者、運動員被通知取消資格時、應立即其所備之號布自動除去、</p>
<p>（註）在競走比賽進程中、最好能　各種信號、作通知之用、如舉白旗以示警告、舉紅旗以示取消資格等、使各職員運動員及觀眾均易明悉、但此項信號並非比賽中必須者、</p>
<p>女子壘球規則之要點</p>
<p>（一）各單位務必於九月十日前、將決定參加之　標種類、依表填製、寄送到會、此項手續、為估計各單位參加人數、及支配球類比賽秩序所必須、本會於收到此項登記表後、始得約計各單位參加人數、預為計算宿舍地位、俾能應付裕如、而免住所侷促不適之弊、而球類比賽秩序、亦得先行妥為編排、藉免秩序　印刷忽促、發生不合、故希各單位勿以此項登記手續為無關重要、而置之不問、海外或邊遠單位、如限於時間、得用電報登記、但宜敘述清楚、庶無錯誤發生、再各單位對於競賽規程第十九章第三十三條之規定、望加以深切注意、於事先慎重攷慮、</p>
<p>（二）各單位務必於九月二十日前、將全部選手註冊表單、寄到本會、以便支配預賽分類、將一切與比賽有關者、詳細刊印於秩序冊中、此項表單、印訂成冊、每頁均可用複寫紙同時繕寫三份、各單位應將各頁之上二張撕下、分訂成二份寄會、餘一份由各單位保存、以備查攷、查前次全國運動大會中、各單位選手註冊、聞有用電報者、叙述旣欠明瞭、文字每多錯誤、不特辦事方面感受困難</p>
<p>、各單位於錯誤發生後、亦自覺不便、故本屆註冊時、各單位務希依照競賽規程第十九章第三十四條之規定、一律用本會印發之正式表單填製寄會、寄送日期、各單位尤望顧及郵遞需要時日、於限期前充分日期前封發、庶本會能近期收到、不致遺誤編配工作及秩序冊之編印、欲求如此、則凡邊遠單位及海外華僑團體、至　應於八月底前舉行預選、並隨即選定代表、填表寄發、</p>
<p>（三）各單位田徑賽全能運動游泳國術及各種表演比賽之選手號布、均由本會印備、於各單位報到時按註冊單上之人數給領、故註冊單內關於上列各項比賽之選手號數格內、請勿自填、</p>
<p>（四）球類選手之號布、不另發給、故各單位於製發制服時、必須將號碼與單位名稱同時做好、且球類選手之號碼、應由各單位在註冊單上填明、各單位對此應特加注意、於定製各選手制服時、其號碼應與註冊單上填明者各相符合、此事於競賽上及觀眾方面、均極感需要、務祈各單位依法實行之、</p>
<p>（五）各種比賽時間上之衝突、事實上幾無法避免、故各單位選擇選手、</p>
<p>（六）本會此次田徑比賽日程、預擬分為六日、　以減少選手同時參加數項之困難、而期得較優之成績、故選手參加項目、如合乎常情、可無衝突或過勞之虞、全能運動擬分二日、繼田徑賽之後舉行、游泳擬分為五日、與全能運動同時開始、各單位選手如有兼全能及游泳者、宜注意及此、</p>
<p>（七）球類比賽於前數日必甚擁擠、但本會決努力設法、使各單位於初賽中同時不致有兩種比賽舉行、然初賽以後之各週、勝負頗難意料、同時舉行、勢所難免、各單位於球員之兼有二種以上者、應善自斟酌、</p>
<p>（八）網球選手按競規程第九章第十六條甲項之規定、應依各選手技術之高下、照第一單打第二單打第次序填寫、　將來出席比賽時　第一單打不能出場、應由第二單打升充、而以其餘四人中之任何一人　補作第二單打、若第一第二兩單打均不出席、則仍依次　補、不容倒置、故各單位於填報時應注意此點、更希各以真誠排列之、至於雙打則可由任何二人組合之、不論單打或雙打、第一次比賽後、即不能再行更換其出席選手、</p>
<p>（九）田徑賽全能運動　　及國術、有選手項目對照表、各單位務必照式填製、與其他註冊單一同寄送、因上列各種比賽、每一選手加入之項目、及每一項目加入之選手人數、均有定額、用此對照表、可免數額之錯誤、故應不憚煩複、按表填製、以利查考、各單位所填對照表與註冊單如　不符、本會當以註冊單為根據、若某一選手參加項目超過定額、或某一項目中參加選手超過定額、本會得任意代為取消任何一項或任何一人、各單位不得有議、</p>
<p>（十）女子田徑賽及男女游泳中之接力、不在參加項目定額之內、換言而之、參加接力者、最多得有五項、又接力註冊時得填寫六人、比賽時得中任何四人出席、但經過預備後、複決賽必須仍由此四人出席、不得其行更動、</p>
<p>（十一）各種球類選手、均有定額、不得多填、否則本會得　任意除去任何一人或數人、其不足額者聽、但註冊後不得請求加足至定額之數、</p>
<p>（十二）各種註冊表單上如有刪改之處、應由負責人在底頁上（即原筆寫之一頁）加蓋印章、以示鄭重、</p>
<p>（十三）各單位職員及選手人數、均以註冊表單所填者為限、本會招待及給發證章、均以此為根據、</p>
<p>（十四）各單位已註冊之選手、如因故不能出席時、得由主管機關備具正式信函、於九月三十日以前、向本會聲請調換、過期無效、（以上海郵局戳記之時日為憑）、且此項調換、僅限於選手、而非參加之項目、故換入之選手、應仍參加原註冊選手所擬參加之項目、不得另易他項、或加增新項目、</p>
<p>（十五）除上述各種註冊表單外、本會另備選手個人登證一種、各單位應令被選手、各依式樣填製、務求詳盡、並附粘二寸半身照片一張、以備查考、此項選手登記證、得於各單位報到時帶交本會、不必寄送、</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>外國人常說中國人迷信，其實外國人迷信的事情，也正罄竹難書呢。就以吸香烟一事而論，外國人的迷信，儘有十倍於中國人的。</p>
<p>蘇格蘭北部的農村中，很流行着一種不可思議的說法，說的是若是正在吸的香烟，忽然自已熄滅了，這個人便會在不久的將來，遭遇到極大的不幸。若是在吸的時候，烟支忽然脫膠而爆裂開來，那麽這個人是要犯刑事，而被繫獄的預兆。西班牙西部，沿大西洋那一帶的居民，是絕對不肯二人同吸一支香烟的。他們的迷信是二人同吸了一支香烟，那麽第一個吸者的老婆，是會和人犯姦的。俄國在革命之前，人民也有一種普遍的迷信，說的是把烟尾扔在地上，若是會得自已燃燒盡的，那麽必有好的幸運降臨，但不能燒盡的，却不主命運的惡劣，不過不能得到意外的幸運而已。匃牙利人在十九世紀的末葉，曾盛行着由吸烟而占卜未來的丈夫或妻子的。大致是一支香烟，能無意地十分順利地吸完的，能在不久的將來，得到一個滿意的對手。若是一支香烟，必需第二次燃點，或脫膠爆烈，或畸形的燃燒着的，便是不能得順利的婚姻的徵兆。</p>
<p>在我們中國，對於香烟上的火，是不能假給人燃點的，更其是愛賭錢的人，視為大忌，說的是給人接了火去，賭起錢來，是必輸的。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「財神阿五」並不是個腰纏萬貫的富翁，却是一個沿門托鉢的叫化。他能有這個名稱，却經過三重變化。第一：人人稱他是「五少爺」，不消說得，他這時乘肥馬，衣輕裘，靠着父母享福的公子哥兒。第二：人人稱他做「五相」，因為他這時田也化光，屋也賣掉，靠着借債過日，第三：才有「阿五」這一個名號，他這時妻子也跟人逃跑，靠着一枝竹竿，一隻破籃，沿門乞討。不過在「阿五」二字上面，加上「財神」二字，我却有些莫名其妙。說是紀念他過去的豪富，那末卑田院中，儘有許多王孫公子。說是揶揄他吧！他小時揮霍却有之，作惡也未必，何必如此刻薄他呢！後來我打聽年老的人們，才知這「財神」二字來歷。</p>
<p>原來他的爸爸，生前却是一個大財主；不過吝嗇成性，一毛不援於人，說不定待人也很刻薄，年過五十，祇生四位千金，並無一個兒子。從前女兒是沒有承繼遺產權，而且他恐怕死後沒有人祭祀所以時時刻刻要想生一個兒子。他是銅錢眼裏翻觔斗的人，所以家裏供奉的是財神，上廟燒香的也是財神；他日夜的在求財神，夢裏見財神賞他一錠元寳，哈哈大笑，醒來却是一夢，而五少爺便在這時生下了。</p>
<p>他以為財神所賜，將來一定要做「沈萬三」第二，所以不敎他念書，也不敎他習業，任他荒遊浪蕩。後來他兩眼一閉，「五少爺」便一步步的變做「財神阿五」了！</p>
<p>「遺子孫以財產，不如遺子孫以學業」。我對於財神阿五的一生經過，更信此言的不虛。</p>

<p>最後，那四位御醫的按脈工程畢竟也完畢了，差不多在同一個時候，忽地爬了起來：又照例的向太后磕了頭，便躡手躡足地走出這一問寢宮去了。太后並不直接和他們說什麽話，倒向我說道：</p>
<p>「德齡，就着你跟他們出去瞧着吧！」</p>
<p>伊的話音還是很峻急，顯然是伊還不曾把伊的無明火完全捺下去咧！但是伊教我出去的意思，却不是造因於此；從伊的日常行動上推測起來，伊多半是對於這四位御醫尙未十分信任的綠故。於是我就急急的奉命而出，緊隨那四位御醫的後面，走進了一座和太后的寢室相毘述的偏殿。那裏巳預先設下了四副很小很矮的桌椅，桌有筆硯紙張安放着；那四位御醫老爺便各自佔據了一座座頭，恭恭敬敬的坐了下去。先是各人默默地寫着一套脈案，這套脈案寫完，才互相討論起來了；各自發表着自已的意思，結果四個人有了四種意思，無一相同。這當然是不行的！四個人便各自竭力讓步，商定了一個協議，同時毀去了先寫的一套脈案，換上一套大致相同的詞句。太后的病情，便像這樣的揣摩討論而决定了！接下去就得由四位各出心裁的開出藥方來了。開藥方的時候，他們似乎更比擬脈案來得鄭重，每個人都在沉思着，吟着，像學堂裏的學生，逢到大考一般的刻苦從事。足足費了一個多錄頭才完成。然而他們關於用藥，却就不再討論了，各憑着自己的意思開出來，結果便產生了四張不同的藥方。（三五四）</p>

<p>夏泊部落的男女同宿</p>
<p>在日本烏取縣氣高郡的夏泊部落，全部有住家七十戶，共計有四百五十人，因為靠着日本海，所以都以捕魚為業。每年在六月一日起始，到九月十五日為止，是捕魚季節。從十五歲以至三十歲的女子，在那季節中，都忙得不亦樂乎，爭相捕魚。男子住在家裏，整理魚貝，分別向各大鄕村去銷售。到了秋季，採取香草，也是夏泊部落婦女們唯一的副業，收入數額，不在少數。</p>
<p>在夏泊部落裏，有三種和其他地方不同的風習，一種就是在日本全國著名的男女同宿，一種是祈願生產女孩，還有一種是舉行團體式的信仰旅行。</p>
<p>男女同宿，在日本稱為「若衆宿」或稱　　　卜，」就是年輕男女，同宿一處的意思。在一間很大的房間中，用屏風分為兩室，在屛風的空隙處，放着一個大爐子。靑年男女們，在晚餐後，各自拿了乾薪兩三根，或木炭四五塊，來到室中的大爐畔，男女雜坐，互相談笑，握手推肩，在所不禁。男的或結漁網，或修家具，女的或作鞋帽，或縫衣裳，等到時刻夜深了，男的到左邊的一室，女的到右邊的一室，各自安睡。</p>
<p>因為有這種風俗，靑年男女，在結婚以前，性的方面，早已解放，早熟的弊害，在所難免，早婚已經成為全部落的風氣。女子在十四歲以上的，男子在十六歲以上的，幾無童貞。彼此旣經發生肉體關係，意見融洽，經過父母的允許，然後舉行正式的結婚典禮。所以這部落中，多私生子，但一旦結婚以後，决沒有什麼離婚的悲劇。</p>
<p>祈願生產女孩的風習，在日本也極以為奇怪。因為日本全國各地，幾全部都是重男輕女的，而在這部落裏，一般都尊重女性。因此每個女子，等到懷孕滿三個月後，由部落的領袖，或由伊的丈夫，向當地神社去瞻拜，祈願平安生產，產出一個强而美麗的女子。</p>
<p>倘若分娩的時候，知道是女孩，不獨闔家快樂，就是全部落的人，都很喜歡。等到女孩滿了四歲，當夏祭節的時候，須把女孩投入海中，所以在夏祭節日以前，做父母親的，一定要天天去敎女孩學游泳，使伊不至受害。</p>
<p>團體式的信仰旅行，日本人也呌做「　　　　」。這部落的居民，往往每年聚合十人或二十人，多的時候，也有糾合四五十人為一隊的互相作一度長期旅行。旅行的目的地，雖然沒有一定，總以寺院廟宇為主，大概在四國一帶，和小豆邊地方，至於東京京都大阪等都會，那恐怕沒有去過一次，所以他們對於日本文化最發達的狀况，簡直不知道。但是他們旅行了一次，等到冬天長夜男女圍爐談笑時，却可增添不少新資料，大家往往把在各地旅館中所遇到的美女，互相說說，不知道那部落裏的女子，聽到以後，有些醋意麼？</p>

<p>「沒有態度」就是作者無論記述一椿故事叙述一段理論毫不把作者自己對於這故事這理論的意見表示出一點來，換句話說，作者完全站在「純客觀」的地位，絲毫沒有主觀的意見摻入進去的，這樣子的文章究竟是可能的麽？</p>
<p>這問題本來早就有人解答過了，不過解答自管解答，而運用者却仍就在那裏運用，「作者站在客觀的立塲，叙述事實的經過，絲毫不入主觀的見解，確為不可多得之作」云云的廣吿還到處可見，甚至批評家還有用這類的話來標榜原作的價値的。我想這種似是而非的觀念，對於靑年就好比鴉片烟毒害他們的腦力和血液一般。</p>
<p>我不想用什麽法什麽論來解答這問題，就請以幾個最淺近的例子來看看。比如我們在一本算學敎科書上寫道：「二加二等於四」，這好像是頂頂客觀而絲毫沒有包含主觀的見解在內了，其實不然。不錯，「二加二等於四」是客觀的眞實，但當我們寫到書上去的時候，並不只是盲目的抄抄而已，首先是須經過我們主觀上的認可才寫上去的，要是主觀上認為二加二等於五的時侯，我們還肯把它寫成二加二等於四麽？又如出現在小說上的年靑女子，十分之九都是被描寫的嬌艷貌美，而實際客觀上那有這麽多的美貌女子呢？這原因就在人類都有一個好美惡醜的主觀審美心在着，所以卽使作者要表現的女子（這自然還是作者意像上的女子）原只有三分的美，結果寫到紙上却變為十分的美貌了。</p>
<p>總之，無論科學或文學，只要是寫到紙上去的文字，都必定包含有作者的主觀見解在內的，（其間祇有主觀成份的多少之差而已：）世上沒有純客觀的文字，却有純主觀的作品。這種純主觀的東西自然是毫無價値可言，徒然和痴人說夢似的囈語一般。一篇有價値的作品————不論她是科學文學——必須是作者主觀的見解恰合於客觀的眞實，換句話說，必須完成於主客觀的統一範疇中的。</p>

<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>拜月亭在明萬曆年間，是曾經牽涉過一椿公案的。沈德符顧曲雜言論拜月亭有云：</p>
<p>「往年癸已，吳中諸公子習武，為江南撫臣朱鑑塘所訐，謂諸公子且反，以其贈客詩：「君實有心追季布，蓬門無計託朱家」為謀反確證。給事中趙完壁因據以上聞。時三相皆吳越人，恐上遂信為眞，急疏請行撫按會勘虛實。會朱已去任，有代為解者曰；此拜月亭曲中陀滿興福投蔣世隆，蔣因有此句答贈，非創作者。因取坊間刻本證之，果然。諸公子獄始漸解，王房仲亦諸公子中一人也。今細閱新舊刻本，俱無此一聯，豈大獄興時，憎其連累，削去此二句耶？或云：拜月初無是詩，特解紛者詭為此說，以為「聊城矢」耳，豈其然乎？」</p>
<p>在談遷棗林雜俎叢整「朱中丞誤奏反詩」一條，亦有相同的記載：</p>
<p>『朱鴻謨開府吳中。時關白多警。太倉王士縣等，羣習弓矢，或訐其反，搜捕手札「君實有心追季布，蓬門無計作朱家」為左據。鴻謨奏上，事下兵部，□□□□□伍袁萃吿尙書石星曰：此拜月亭傳奇中語，所得作反案。出坊本示之，尙書釋然。』</p>
<p>據此，指出這二句詩是拜月亭中語的解紛人，為伍袁萃。伍曾著有林居漫錄，惜我尙未曾得讀。北大史學創刊號，有張君讀書記，云及漫錄亦記有此事。但未審原書所記詳略如何耳？到淸褚人穫的堅瓠集裏，又有同樣的叙述，特為詳細：</p>
<p>「萬曆乙未，吳人以關白未靖，在位者皆謹備之。王鳳洲仲子士騄，延陵秦方伯燿，弟燈，雲間喬憲長子相，俱自負貴介。士繼能文章，燈善談，相善書翰，各有時名，互相往來，出入狹邪。適遇海警，盡攘臂起，若將曰：我且制倭，我且立無前功者。時姦人趙州平，竄身諸公子間，引以自重，每佩劍遊酒樓博塲，皆與諸公子俱，一時無不知有趙州平也。乃汎汎投刺富人曰：吾曹欲首事，靖海島寇，貸君家千金為鑲。富人懼焉，或貸之百金，或數十金，否則輒目懾曰：爾為我守金，不久我且提兵勦汝矣！蓋意在得金，姑為大言，恐之。諸富人見其交諸公子，又常佩創出入，以為必且帥其黨，奪我金也，轟言趙州平，王，棄，喬諸公子將為亂，巡撫朱鑑塘（洪謨）檄有司擒治之，以事聞於朝。疏載反詩，有「君實有心追季布，蓬門無計作朱家」句。下兵部議，伍寗方（萃）言於本兵石星；此二句乃幽閨記中語，所得為證？下撫按，勘問，鞫之無實，其後論州平及燈死，士繡戍，相配，人咸以為寃。成疑獄，久繫。（下略）」</p>
<p>大概因為時代的關係，用不着有所諱飾，所以記載事實，比沈談都淸楚，惟年分作乙未，比沈氏所記後二年。在這三種筆記裏，全說兩句反詩是拜月亭中有的，林居漫錄雖未見到，料想以解紛人伍袁萃的自記，當更不會例外。於是問題就來了！拜月亭內却委實幷沒有這兩句詩，非但現在流傳的本子裏沒有，就在沈德符當日，已經「遍檢新舊諸刻」，深改疑測。顧曲雜言中有「頃歲丁酉」的話，當係作於萬曆二十五年，（一五九七）上距癸巳，才隔了首尾五年；若按褚說作乙未，則僅不到三年。沈氏和王房仲又是朋友。連沈氏全查過拜月亭「俱無此一聯」，似乎不能不算是可詫的事。</p>
<p>近來偶然發見此詩一聯，實曾見於明人傳奇小說蘭會龍池錄中，亦即叙蔣世隆事者。此詩載在篇首敷行中，開卷即得，惟略有數字更易</p>
<p>「水萍相遇自天涯，文武崢嶸興莫賒。仇國有心追季布，蓬門無膽作朱家。蛟龍豈是池中物，珠翠終成錦上花。此去從伊携手處，相聯奎壁耀江華。」</p>
<p>蘭會龍池錄據鄭振鐸明淸二代的平話集及孫楷第日本東京所見中國小說書目提要，見於所述繡谷春容及國色天香二書中，同收的還有天緣奇遇，覓蓮記等傳奇文。除此似未見著錄。我所見的是光緒二十年上海晋記書莊的鉛字排印本才情集，署「七種才情傳奇書」，即係就國色天香下層所刊七種出，標目次序，完全相同。第一篇就是這蘭會龍池錄。所叙情節，大抵即襲自拜月亭。王瑞蘭作黃瑞蘭，父名黃復（祖黃潛善）陀滿興福作蒲粶興福，蔣，黃俱非金人，而為宋人，興福為金逃將。開始即述與蔣之結納，系以上引之一詩。以下關目多所增設緣飾之處，重以詩詞文字，和一些空腐的議論，十足傳奇文氣度。「蘭會龍池」云云者，因世隆繪是圖，藉以傳示瑞蘭，謀復合也。戲曲中最精彩動人的拜月一節情事，則被刪掉，而以蔣黃二人旅媾時，相挑拜月於東庭替換，眞是買檀還珠了。其中世隆議論梨園演戲一節，曾說到金印八義等記，撰作時代當不能過早，總在隆，萬之時，今知最先刊載蘭會龍池錄的繡谷春容，正是萬曆年間刻的。</p>
<p>現在我們可以根據這點，對「反詩」事有下列幾種可能的解釋：</p>
<p>一，拜月亭原文當並實無是詩，特其時人因傳奇二字之包含有二種文體，所叙又同為蔣世隆事，不加詳察，遂傳譌為幽閨，亦未可知？所證坊本恐即蘭會龍池錄。如拜月乃憎其連累，後來刊本，坊賈刪去此詩，則在沈氏當時，舊本不應亦無之。</p>
<p>二，沈氏「解紛者詭為此說」的話，也許近於事實。伍袁萃也是吳人，當時蘇州同鄉為這椿大獄出力奔走，設法，是很顯明的事實。（如王樨登等）蘭會龍池錄蓋特因此事而作，所以開首即系以此詩，惟恐人之不見及，並以牽强而證明出於拜月亭之一語。拜月傳世已久，難於屬入；傳奇二字，適可假借。不過一般人對蘭會龍池錄知道較少，仍多以為是戲曲拜月亭不無疑測，沈氏所記，或者還是有意彌縫這個漏洞而設，所謂「憎其連累削去些一句耶」的語氣，原是較着重於「豈其然耶」的解紛說的</p>
<p>三，詩中文字，傳奇文改「君實」為「仇國」，「無計」作「無膽」，就文義上論，較少違得字眼，語意也小心謹慎一些。（蔣黃的國籍，改金為宋，，興靦為金逃將，其中或正因切「仇國」二字的緣故。）雖然遲輯地說，這一聯文字應與沈，談，褚所記，完全符合才對；但沈記「作」字即係作「託」字，三篇記事也都有小出入，幾個字的彼此舛異，許還不致使推翻上面的推論。</p>
<p>四，倘使這樣說，蘭會龍池錄所載詩句，原與沈，談，褚等無殊，「仇國」云云，係因此事發生，懼禍更改者。則此傳奇文撰作年代，要略為提前一些。第二項的論斷，迹近穿鑿，第一項的解釋，或者仍能適用</p>
<p>五，這椿公案的幾個當事人，結果似幷未能免於罪，是解紛的論證，也不曾有什麽大效力。大約拜月亭根本幷無是詩，而是飾詞說項的事實，當局後來已查明白了罷？</p>
<p>更正：昨日「小說叢話論略」一文，業已登完，該文末尾「未完」二字，實為誤排。特此吏正，希讀者注意。</p>

<p>日子，忽忙的過去了，在心網上存留的，像昨天一樣，但，那巳經是三年的時光了呵！</p>
<p>正是炎熱的大暑天，在都會的馬路上，或許要冒着油，蟬翼的紗衣，早就披上了肩頭，可是，在這山窩子裏，是看不見那些的。山道的石塊上，翻着熱，穿透了革鞋，躐到被汗水浸漁了的脚底。頭上，也不會舒服的，太陽瞪着血紅的眼睛，照得每個人的身子都有點麻辣辣地，一頂大得像竹籮樣的帽子負遮了前額，但，當你站在樹蔭深處把帽子脫下來以後，頂心上就有一股熱氣直冒。</p>
<p>然而，到現在，愉快緊撲了我們的心頭，衝着浮動雲棉的靑空，吁了一口氣，長長地。我們想，你血紅的眼睛，此後將沒有力量再瞪了，你網織下藩籬，今天起，要如數的把你摧毀。</p>
<p>眞的，這是一個奇蹟，好像漠無人烟的沙漠裏發現了大的淸泉一樣，從離開了船埠到現在，整整地在翻翻熱的山道上八天了。雖說「汽車」並不算希奇，在都會裏或者竟和爬動的臭虫一樣的平常，但，處在羣山包繞的底下，居然能看見這凈潔的Ford車子，欣快的流露，可以在臉上淸楚的蕩漾。</p>
<p>照樣的，在「鷄鳴早看天」的時候爬起來，哄亂的洗過了臉，這回，用不着再捆紮滑杆，把行李都搬裝到長途汽車上。不知怎麼，人會有那麽多，把這汽車團團地圍着，咕唧，張望，笑，表情是非常複雜的，後來，大概還以為如此仍不能滿足，於是，有幾個揑車前的喇叭，有的摸車前的燈，更有的去按藏在底下的車胎。可笑麽？也許，一個望不見都會物質文明的山城，又怎能不引起了他們的新奇之感呢？</p>
<p>衝出了城，向着比較寬敞的公路上駛去。路，並不很平，埋在底下的石子在仰着頭，自然，車子是不肯停息的顚顯着，雖則避免了血紅的眼睛直接的襲擊，可是，那車里面的木櫈子，坐得長久了也會使屁股發燒的。並且，你還要提防著自己的頭，臂，膀子，假使不留神的話，說不定車的木壁會和你接吻的，會使你在甜吻之下發着無名的火跳。</p>
<p>——大站三十，小站十五。張伕頭的額紋，又在一動一動的。</p>
<h3 id="c228">介紹「一位藝術名人」 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 方土人</p>
<p>從塔斯社的通訊裏，知道蘇聯近來正熱烈地在慶祝編劇天才貝洛塞爾可夫斯基的五十壽辰，該國中委主席並巳决定贈他一個「藝術名人」的尊號。這位藝術名人的大名，以及他的大作，對於我國的讀者，恐怕還是非常生疎的。現在趁他正做五十大壽的時候，來略微替他介紹幾句，讀者諸君不會怪我冒昧罷。</p>
<p>貝洛塞爾可夫斯基在俄羅斯和英吉利的小帆船上當過水手，在歐洲大陸當過工塲勞動者，在美洲當過雇農，當過短工，俄羅斯革命時期又在西伯利亞作過兵。我們在俄羅斯每一次高漲的怒潮中，差不多都可以看見他的影子。</p>
<p>他的戲劇就反映着這一種非常活躍而又色彩鮮明的生活。「響應」是描寫當俄羅斯被武裝干涉時期，美利堅勞動者企圖罷運恊約國的軍火。「月亮從左邊上升」是動亂時期中的一個戀愛故事，山於劇中主人翁有「陷入情網的男女是反革命這一句金石之言而著名了。「暴風雨」是他的第一部革命羅曼斯，它是要顯示「集體情緒的英雄主義」。「風平浪靜」是描寫和「暴風雨」中相同的人物怎麽樣繼續經過了新經濟政策時期。還有許多描寫水手的戲劇，描寫礦工的戲劇，「囚籠」很巧妙地描畫出三個奴隸時代：他從英吉利海船上看見的非洲海岸上的黑奴——只和牲口差不多呵；舊俄羅斯的農奴；以及一個人在不知不覺間出賣了自己的所謂現代的奴隸——價錢最低廉的奴隸。</p>
<p>他的初期的戲劇都是為西伯利亞的兵士而寫作的。直到一九二五年「暴風雨」的演出，他才被人稱為第一個新的戲劇作家。他覺得那時候的舞台都是很守舊的，只是以古典的英雄和布爾喬亞的美學自娛。藝術家和導演們都不注意新的英雄；他們不曾接觸到現實，「暴風雨」中的角色，對於那時的演員們，都是非常新奇而不可思議的。他們起初上波，就與好像小學生在背誦着他們所不曾了解的課文一樣。然而，聽衆却都了解了，而且大聲喝采了，到這時候，演員們才瞥見了他們所表演的這「暴風雨」的偉大意義。</p>
<p>「暴風雨」不但被尊為第一部偉大的蘇聯悲劇，而且更是最基本的蘇聯悲劇。它是關於生，死，以及戀愛諸哲學問題的心理學的研究。通過了顯微鏡的另一個鏡頭，對新環境的創造者的內心生活加以檢視。劇中的戀愛是從環境當中自然地發生，悲哀也並不是老套的布爾喬亞的歇私特里亞。新的人依照新的方式感受，這個却也並不是由於他的神經系統，而是由於基本的立塲和不屈不撓的主要行動所表示了出來的。所有的人物都是在他們生活的總和中描寫着他們時代的典型。每個人有他個人的哲學，然而個人的哲學正是他那集體的竹學的代表。</p>
<p>「暴風雨」使貝洛塞爾可夫斯基成為「藝術名人」。自有其特殊原因，並不是偶然的。</p>

<p>— 德國施托漠著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>到我完全淸醒時候，我已經躺在磨坊工人住房內沙發上面了，這工人就在磨坊池岸近旁住着。娜麗跟隨她的母親回家去了，她的母親這天也出城來的。克里斯多夫還留在這兒，磨坊工人的老婆教了他，他正忙着把潮濕的繃帶放在我頭上。當我睜開眼睛時候，他正坐在我旁邊椅子上，一個裝水的瓦盆了放在他膝蓋中間。他正要把繃帶換過；但他現在把手抽回去了，他忸怩地問我：「我可以帮助你麽，菲力？」</p>
<p>我坐了起來，設法把我的思想結合起來，我頭痛得很。「不，」我過一會說，「我用不着你來帮助。」</p>
<p>「要我從城裏呌一個人到這裏來麼？」</p>
<p>「你去吧；我自已會走回家去的。」</p>
<p>克里斯多夫遲疑地站起來，把盆子放在桌上。</p>
<p>不久之後房門饗了，他抓着門把，但他並沒有走。當我回頭來看時候，我看見我的舊時朋友底眼睛帶着一種誠意的憂愁的表情對着我。</p>
<p>我還遲疑了一秒鐘。「克里斯多夫，」我說，站了起來並把手伸給他，「如果你有閒空的話，那麼就請你再留一會兒，你可以拿臂膀扶我，我們一起走回城裏去。」</p>
<p>他的臉上發出快樂的光輝。他抓着我的手，搖着。「那一拳打得過重了呀，菲力！」他說</p>

<h3 id="c230">復興民族與民族改造 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>我國民族素有東亞病夫之稱，這是一個莫大的恥辱！今番陳立夫蔡元培于右任諸先生，鑑於中國整個民族生理和行為的萎靡衰頹，為欲復興民族，特發起組織一個民族改造社，以研究民族的病態，而謀改造的方針。現正積極籌備，並發表組織宣言及改造方案。在宣言中，指出我國民族的生理狀態，為一百病叢生的集團。諸如駝背聳肩，神虛影弱，態多病狀畸形，貌則愁眉菜色，行動迂緩，工作不緊張，槁木死灰，龍鍾老態，男子乏鬚眉的氣概，女子尙愁病的容態。舉國上下，不論智賢，不肯，無不暮氣沉沉，氣息奄奄也。其餘如行為的病態，則為虎頭蛇尾，熱度五分，敷衍，虛偽，團結漫似散沙，眼光大如沙豆。其所釐定的方案，為政府集中全民族的力量，而謀北方的建設，務使達到繁榮的鵠的。同時政府應逐漸開發北方，而吸回南遷的優秀民族。又復運用科學方法，而實施婚姻統制。其餘如食料疾病，以及其他挽救體智的方法，亦應加以科學的統制。</p>
<p>要强國必先强種，沒有强健的民族，要希望有興盛的國家，這無異是痴人的妄想。我國整個民族的萎靡衰頹，已是一個無可諱言的現象。救濟之策，自必以改造民族入手，從各方面，全國一致努力，務使我四萬萬民族，達到智體均衡發展的地步而後已。當這民族復興之聲遍及國內，我國諸有識者，有這民族改造社的組織，實深値得國人慶幸也！</p>
<p>然今日而言復興民族，改造民族，雖屬迫切，但改造民族的工作，則甚艱困。蓋我國民族的萎靡衰頹，由來已久，要加改造，自非一朝一夕所能為力。必需舉國上下，用全力以赴之，才可以希望其成功。以我個人的意見，改造民族，應該從兩方面下手。一方面是民族精神的改造，把我國民族的消極的，腐敗的，守舊的，迷信的，怯弱的，自私的，狹隘的，退步的精神，改造為積極的，淸新的，趨時的，科學的，勇敢的，寬大的，進取的精神，改造精神的方法，力量最大，功效最著的，就是敎育。這一點望從事於敎育事業的人加以注意，負起這一個改造民族的責任！</p>
<p>還有一方面便是體格的改造。我國民族體格的衰弱，也和精神的頹敗一樣，幾成為不可救藥，眞是一百病叢生的集團。這種民族體格若不早圖改造，卽將來人不滅我，我亦自滅！且健全的精神，寓於健全的體格。體格不改造，要望精神的健全，實不可能。故改造體格，比改造精神，更為重要。然體格怎樣改造呢？最要的是提倡體育。我們要使全國人民，無論男女老幼，農工商士兵，每個人都能實行有益的運動，以鍜鍊自己的體格，成為一個禮格壯强的國民。其次對於配偶的選擇，子女的生育，亦應緊切講究。至如日常的起居飲食，衛生疾病等，又不可不加以充分的注意。這於民族體格，關係亦甚大也。</p>
<p>民族興衰，在這一舉。願我國人，大家奮起而致力於民族的改造！</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>去年一年的大旱，使農村里受了極大的打擊，然而冬天沒有雪，到了春天也不多雨水；一直至小滿，老天爺依舊是乾乾燥燥的不曾發下水來。田爿燥得像赤土，池沼里只剩得鍋底水，河浜里的淤泥和沙灘全出現在面上和大毒日頭鬥法，卽是幾處較深的渠里也祇有一層薄薄瓜皮水了。於是農人們心里便感到了一個預期的恐怖，第二個旱荒又要臨頭了！</p>
<p>時間是隨着寒暑表的升降而過去，只一霎眼芒種已過，那些高低的田爿里都應當預備插秧了；但是許多地方鋤了濫田，而泥塊却硬得像鐵一般，田溝里也沒有沒脚踝的水，如果天再不發些水下來，那末怎樣能够蒔秧？倘言再等十來天，蒔秧的時期就要過去，那個時候再發水，也就遲了；這樣下去，今年的旱荒還能够避免嗎？</p>
<p>有幾處近有水河浜的地方，已經在日夜的車水，但是那些乾煞山田里却只有瞪着眼珠子望天，有秧也沒處種，但是蕩田里也不好，種了秈稻怕天不下雨，反正還是一個乾死，假如種了晚稻呢，那到了立秋做起倒黃梅來，却難免被淹沒，所以今年高的不好，低的也討厭，眞是叫一般農民焦灼得沒有法子想。尤其是梧村頭德勝爹，這幾天儘像熱鍋上的螞蟻般的不安，他現在並且以村中耆老的名分，在沈家宗祠里召集了一個緊急會議：</p>
<p>「天再這樣旱下去，我們今年的秧是準播不成了；去年已經遭了一次旱荒，要是今年再連一年，那末我們老百姓還吃得苦起嗎？現在種秧時候不發水，將來再發還有什麼用？我看如今時間已經急迫，明天馬上通知村里，先斷屠，要是一個禮拜再不下雨，這只好辛苦五聖老爺，請他出來求雨了。」德勝爹坐在板桌的上首，發表了他的意見，接着　　了烟斗里的烟燼，喝了一口茶潤潤喉嚨，再向衆人問一聲：「諸位的心想以為怎樣」？</p>
<p>他們的開會並沒有儀式，祇在宗祠的飯廳里用兩隻方桌拚在一起，週國擺十多條板凳，還有泡了一壺茶和備了幾包老黃烟，就大家雜亂地坐坐那里討論起來。</p>
<p>德勝爹問完了話，使用一副奕奕有神的目光，向每一個人的臉上掃瞥了一下。</p>
<p>「對，老爹說的話是對的，我們從明天起，應該先斷了屠再說。」大家同聲地回答。</p>
<p>「哎！我活了五十多歲了，沒有碰到過這種年成，要是百姓不作孽，老天怎樣會降這許多災殃下來呢？」德勝爹站了起來，走出了談話圈外，這樣的嘆息着。</p>
<p>但是當他們散了會之後，纔要走出祠堂門的時候，烏雲却已密佈在天空了</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>。他們還沒有回到家里，銅板大的雨點子就向大地打了下來；沒有一個鐘頭，幾條溝里全潺潺地淌在急流了，田爿里也都積下了寸許水。</p>
<p>這一整天雨沒有停過，一直落到了第二天的早晨，村里的農民，在蒼白的臉子上都同樣地顯露了一層欣慰的微笑，這時大家都戴上了箬帽，披起了簑衣，全下田去工作—援秧插秧了。</p>
<p>這一趟雨下得雖不十分多，可是已經是我們的救命水，只要能够過幾天再下一回，這樣陸續不斷的下來，那就有希望了！」德勝爹插罷了秧，從田里走了起來，坐在田埂上休息的時候，一壁抽着旱烟，一壁望着天說。</p>
<p>「是呵！總要老天爹帮忙，我們窮人才有命！」小頭三懶懶地從地下站起身來，伸伸懶腰，覺得這幾天田事太吃重了，所以四肢疲倦得像癱了一般，然而精神却是興奮的。</p>
<p>半個月後，梧村頭附近的一大片田野里全舖滿了碧綠蔥靑的禾苗，欣欣然的在細雨或晴日下隨風搖曳。</p>
<h3 id="c232">逃荒 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>這裏，在黃霉時期的來臨中，暴發了一次水，好容易不久便退去了；於是，這裏的延續生命底滋料是給吞噬完了，留下的是一些人，一些餓得像鬼也似的人。</p>
<p>不用說，泥地是給漲像棉花一般，熟得咬人足趾，樹幹上也滿沾着泥水，田園已失去了它的踪跡。眞是，十天前的一個人烟稠密的小鄉村，如今已荒得像一座枯廟，不，一片廣遼的大沙漠哪</p>
<p>夜，漸漸地把光亮蝕去了；受了創傷後的鄉村，已找不出一點燈火的影子。大夥兒空了肚子，在黑暗的領城裏，咒詛着命運的遭遇。天，和十天前的天沒有變，仍是那樣明朗的亮月，仍是那樣霎着眼珠的星星；可是，在這一夥可憐的生命中，却感到和十天前有天淵之別了。他們不明瞭這年頭人們在造什麽孽？人世間的苦楚已是覺得不堪摧殘了，更加上了這樣無救的天災，這是象徵着末日的駕降，與乎消滅生命的預示呵！</p>
<p>於是，他們每一人都抱着那麽一顆恐怖的心靈。</p>
<p>好在正是酷熱的夏天，露天的夜宿並不怎樣覺得冷，湊上了大夥兒熱情，倒也沒覺得寂寞。在斷絕糧食的時候，大家叩問着那個有名的智多星—陳老官。在這樣的情緒下，陳老官再也不能設法了：『唉！今後的糧食怎樣呢？』</p>
<p>『不是？這麽一大夥的人哪！』阿桂爸補上了一句。</p>
<p>你望我，我望着你，大家想不出一些頭緒。最後，還是那個敎書的王老先生說出這樣一叚話：「在這裏還不是乾望着泥土等死麽？唯一的辦法還是到省城裏去。」</p>
<p>『不錯，王老先生的話不錯。』陳老官說。</p>
<p>『那麽，事不宜遲，咱們明天一早就走吧！』</p>
<p>『好，明兒就走』大夥兒都是這麽說的。</p>
<p>星星霎着眼，像在譏笑。</p>
<p>夜，更進一層的剝奪，差不多連離開一尺的人臉也瞧不淸了。大夥兒在妥協的議决後，大家緊了緊褲帶，藏着一個空肚子，疲怠地橫在僅存的破蓆上度着這一夜的過程。</p>
<p>靜悄悄，偶然遠地裏叫着一種沒有力的犬吠，便會把這一些驚破了心的人們張一張倦了的眼。瞧瞧有些什麽變動</p>
<p>孩子為了沒有乳吃，放開嘶啞了的小喉嚨，呀呀地啼哭起來：婦人們唱着悲悽的催眠曲，男子們喉聲嘆氣。在平日的這時早已睡在夢鄕裏了。可是今兒不知是什麼理由，連打一個瞌睡的心緒也沒有。哭聲，催眠聲，嘆息聲，以及狗子們的輕吠，夜鴟的叫喊，交響着（世界上最著名的悲哀之歌曲。</p>
<p>一夜在悽凉的靈圍裏度過了。</p>
<p>第二天，星屋還沒有消滅的早晨，天空還染着了暗灰的色調。心急的黃大嫂却喊了起來：『天不早啦！我們好起身張羅張羅東西，早些兒趕到省城裏去呢？』</p>
<p>沒有留戀，沒有悲哀，大夥兒一蜂擁的起身，收拾了一些敗殘了的東西。男的把孩子盛在筐子裏挑着走，女的背了些破壞的布衣及棉絮，年老的支起了衰弱的身子，一步步踏上了生之前程。</p>
<p>太陽起來了，任性地向人們的一切下一次嚴厲的酷刑，火也似的在人們的背上燒出了汗滴。大地像經過了滾水的傾瀉，熱到脚底下發痛。二</p>
<p>一條皮包骨頭的狗子，伸長了舌尖，貪婪地在低着頭吻着地面。</p>

<p>「秋扇明燈」採取了極現實的題材，來描寫社會的病態—封建和新浪漫思想交織下所生的癥結。</p>
<p>劇作者譚友六並不只是感傷的來同情犧牲在社會病態下的人們，而且堅强的指示這些人們在接受到社會病態的刺激後所應有的反應。</p>
<p>純封建式的父親，天賦有選探異性機能而又傳染了新思想的女兒，以及浮頑自棄的靑年，畸形生活而不自知的女人，在表演社會所經見的誘惑，遺棄，墮落的悲劇。</p>
<p>「秋扇明燈」不但澈底的揭出了這悲劇的開展與結束，而更可貴的是它描畫出這悲劇主演人復活的過程，和企求再生的動機。</p>
<p>譚友六運用了特殊手法，沉着的描寫故事，明快的組織畫面，加重了「秋扇明燈」中心結構的力量，來為迷途的人們大聲疾呼，指出光明的道路。</p>
<p>人的生命死亡了，沒有復活的可能，人的靈魂陷落了，是有再生機會的，堅强的意志更足以打破社會的岐視，而加强企求再生八們的自信心。</p>
<p>黎莉莉向來所演的戲，多是担任愉快活潑的角色，在「秋扇明燈」裏，是要做悲哀愁苦莊重的戲，和以前完全不同的，而她在這轉變作風的成績上，更决定是一個多方面的角色。</p>

<p>今年四個月中木材進口較上年同期增四百萬　自實行新稅後水泥進口較三年前僅餘五之一</p>
<p>二，木材</p>
<p>我國國產木材曰廣木。西木。建木。杭木等名。其出產以廣木為最富。產地在廣西之北。貴州之東。湖南之五嶺山脈與衡山脈之間。因其蘊藏最深。每年產量為最豐。次之為西木。建木。杭木。等每年產量相若。西木產於江西之杉嶺及九連山脈一帶。連年因遭共匪出入。兵燹連連。乏人培植。出產銳减。建木產於福福建之建寗。建甌等等地。其出產以段木為多。如本市出售之雙連。連半。桶木。單同等皆是。杭木產於浙西各縣。沿衢江。徽江而出。彙集杭州（故是名之）。但兩江所產之性質各異。衢江一帶所出者。因其天然倉老。性柔質堅。徽江所出者。因人工培植易於長成。產量較豐。但其性鬆嫩。遠遜衢江之所產也。當經營是業者。在民十四，五年間最興隆。本市每年銷額恒在三四千萬元之巨。近因巿鎭建築皆趨歐化。以减少柱子。需用長料。故國人皆樂用洋木。因國木不及洋木之長大也。故現在除農村建築及小型建築採用國木外。如市鎭之高大建造所需之木材及鐵路上用之枕木。無有不用洋松者。國木銷路銳减。洋木進口年增。茲據海關發表。今年自一月至四月之四個月中輸入木材達九百二十一萬八千七百七十五關金元。合國幣為一千五百八十八萬三千九百四十九元。較去年同期之五百零二萬零五百九十七關金元。以關金比較要增加百分之八十三零。倘以二十二年同期之進口數四百八十九萬四千六百二十二關金元與二十三年比之。則三年同期之進口數增加百分之九十。列表於下。</p>

<p>— B．A．Hueton原著小昂譯</p>
<p>（二）建築作風之選擇</p>
<p>戲院的形式，和營業有密切的關係·如果形式精巧·能够引起行人注意　美觀，營業一定很發達的，但戲院是高尙娛樂的塲所，一定要非常的雄壯和幽雅，俄國的戲院，很早就注意到這一點，Hueton氏這一次把這種作風介紹到美國去了。</p>
<p>（三）內部之設計</p>
<p>（甲）休息室，在未演片之前，一定有許多的觀衆，在門前等候，那麽休息室是不可少的了，這裏的設備不妨奢侈一點，陳設不妨高貴一點，有沙發，有咖啡點，有厠所，總之要使觀衆，不致發生久等的威覺，這裏的地方可以大一點，能够容納三分之一的觀衆，在冬天有熱汀的裝置，在夏天有電扇的設備，仝時牆壁上，可以掛很美麗明星的照片，很動人情緒的廣吿，這些對于營業的關係，很密切的，不可不注意。</p>
<p>（乙）視綫，戲院的設計，最重要的，就是視綫了，無論在樓上樓下和角隅的，都要能看淸，這是一個很不容易解决的問題，Haueton氏他能利用他的天才，根據光學的原理，把戲塲的形狀，改成一種特別適宜的橢圓形，電影機在這一端的焦點，布幕在那一端的焦點，這樣一來，光綫反射出去，四座的觀衆，感覺到特別的淸楚和舒服，這是他驚人的發現和創造呢。</p>
<p>（丙）音波——其次重要的，就是音波，現在有聲電影發明，聲音是要特別的淸亮和悅耳，要有回聲，使音增高，同時又要有散音材料，使音響勻和，Haoton氏他利焦點的地位，果然音響特別的好，可謂是異外的成功了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) The peace and security of Beiping City are currently jointly maintained by the 37th Division of the 29th Army under Feng Zhi'an, the 116th Division under Miao Zhengliu, and the 139th Division under Huang Guanghua. The strength of these three divisions is ample, and there will be absolutely no problems from now on. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the establishment of the Beiping City Martial Law Headquarters, the Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuchang and Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Shao Wenkai and Yu Jinhe all arrive at the headquarters at 10:00 AM every day to work. The work of various departments is handled by the respective departments of the garrison command. The arrangements for maintaining peace and security in Beiping City are complete, and there is absolutely no cause for concern. The protection of various public utility organizations and the inspection of all trains on the Pingjin, Pinghan, Pingsui, and Pingtong lines are the responsibility of the joint military-police-gendarmerie office. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Liu Jialin, Chief of Staff of the Pingjin Garrison Command, the suppression of the riot has now come to an end. However, in order to prevent future incidents, the security measures are difficult to remove. But the principle is still to give convenience to the people. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhi'an arrives in Beiping tonight to command his troops in maintaining security in the suburbs of Beiping. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhi'an's division will arrive completely by the 2nd. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3:00 PM on the 1st, Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin to visit Meijin, Sakai, Iwai, Takahashi, etc., at the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple, to explain the riot by Bai Jianwu, our military's handling methods, and the current bandit situation near Tongzhou County. Yin is scheduled to return to Tongzhou County on the 2nd. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At around 6:00 AM this morning, a freight train arriving in Beiping from Tianjin was inspected by police officers stationed at the station by the Public Security Bureau, together with Guo Mingjun, a railway policeman of the Beining Line. As expected, two hand grenades and a military saber were found in a closed iron car. However, the person carrying them was not found. The contraband was taken by the railway police to the First Police Precinct for safekeeping. Ninety-two rioters captured by the Xianghe County militia were escorted from Tongzhou to Beiping last night and handed over to the Garrison Command for interrogation. The command immediately began interrogating them through the military law office overnight, and the interrogation was completed this morning. The confessions of the prisoners were immediately submitted to the military sub-council to request instructions on how to deal with them. According to sources, none of the rioters escorted to Beiping were important figures. Their confessions revealed that they were mostly coerced into blindly following orders, and their offenses were minor. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The ninety-two rebels intercepted in recent days have been escorted back to Beiping. Most of them were soldiers on the armored train that attacked Beiping. It is said that they had no prior knowledge of the riotous plot, but as soldiers, they had to obey the orders of their superiors. The Garrison Commander has therefore requested instructions from the Military Sub-Council on how to deal with them. This morning, plainclothes troops were discovered near Tongzhou, and four were shot dead by Chinese troops, while the rest fled. It is rumored that Bai Jianwu left Beiping in disguise yesterday and fled to Tianjin, but the central authorities are still conducting a thorough search for the rioters. It is rumored that Shi Yousan is hiding in the Legation Quarter. Beiping has not yet lifted martial law. (1st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 30th, military police in Tongzhou captured three plainclothes troops east of the river. Tongzhou County is still under strict guard from 8:00 PM every night, prohibiting anyone wearing plainclothes from passing through. The evening train between Beiping and Tongzhou is still suspended. (1st, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tongzhou reports that around 3:00 AM this morning, three plainclothes bandits were discovered east of the river and captured by our special police, and escorted to the Tongzhou County Government for detention. Here, martial law is still in effect from 8:00 PM every night, and vigilance is strengthened during the day. The trains operating between Beiping and Tongzhou, which depart at 6:00 PM every day, are still temporarily suspended. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Duan Zongze, who commanded the armored train to attack Beiping on Friday, was captured by police in Lizhuang near Tongzhou. Duan was a former subordinate of Shi Yousan and attempted to speculate with the rebellious crowd, but ultimately fell into the legal net. The security regiment has captured a total of thirty-six rebels, who have been escorted to Beiping for interrogation. (1st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After 92 mutinous soldiers from the Fengtai armored train were captured on the 29th, they were escorted to the Pingjin Garrison Command on the evening of the 30th. After an overnight interrogation by the command, it was revealed that they had received a false order from the mutinous captain Duan Chunze before the incident, stating that a riot had occurred in Beiping City and they should quickly go to suppress it. The soldiers were unaware of the truth and were thus coerced into action. When they were defeated, the mutinous captain continued to issue false orders, claiming that it was a temporary setback and they should seek opportunities to develop further. The garrison command believed that among the 92 captured mutinous soldiers, there was only one second lieutenant officer. The rebellion of the remaining soldiers was indeed due to coercion, which was excusable. The command is now seeking instructions from the Military Sub-Council on how to handle the matter. The rumor that the mutinous captain Duan Chunze was escorted to Beiping on the 30th is not true, according to reliable sources, but it is said that he has been detained by the Xianghe County Government. (1st, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tongzhou reports that on the evening of the 30th and the morning of the 1st, the area near Tongzhou was peaceful. Bai Jianwu led the rebellious troops to disperse and scatter in small groups of three to five, fleeing to Xianghe, Sanhe, Dou Di, and other counties. The commander of the fake Second Army, Zhang Bi, fled into the war zone. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tongzhou reports that most of the mutinous bandits from the 6th Armored Train Squadron have been arrested. Squadron leader Duan Chunze has fled alone to Tangshan, relying on a certain captain. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) All members of the sub-council telegraphed Nanjing on the afternoon of the 1st, urging He Yingqin to return north to take charge of the situation. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin sent three telegrams to Beiping yesterday, expressing great concern about the security of Beiping City and inquiring in detail about the current situation. However, he did not mention when he would return to Beiping. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, regarding the policy towards China, observed the aftermath of the Manchurian Incident until the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Originally, he intended to shift to a good neighbor policy of non-threat and non-aggression. However, the issues of Zhangbei and North China suddenly arose, hindering progress. Recently, these two issues have been resolved. He decided to take this as an opportunity to implement a good neighbor policy towards China. Therefore, he ordered Ambassador Arima to go to Nanjing on the 3rd of this month and start negotiations with the National Government. How Ambassador Arima will act under Foreign Minister Hirota's new ambitions is particularly noteworthy. (1st, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Republic of China's Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, is now scheduled to depart from Tokyo on the 5th of this month to return to his country. Therefore, he visited Army Minister Hayashi at 2:00 PM on the 1st to express his intention to say goodbye.</p>
<p>At the same time, he inquired again about the army's policy towards China. The meeting lasted for twenty minutes before he left. (1st, Japan Federation News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japan Strives to Develop Commerce and Trade in Inner Mongolia <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Historically, due to geographical and political relations, Japan's concern for Inner Mongolia has been akin to scratching an itch from afar. In particular, trade has been almost completely cut off in recent years. However, with the recent resolution of the North China and Chahar issues, various obstacles have been removed. In particular, the safety of transportation on the border between Manchuria and Mongolia has been guaranteed, gradually leading to the momentum of Japan's trade development in Inner Mongolia. The first to realize this is the Iran-Khorasan Trading Company, with a capital of 600,000 yuan, which has established a separate company with its headquarters in Changchun and branch offices in Shenyang, Chifeng, Kulun, and other parts of Inner Mongolia. On one hand, it imports Inner Mongolian specialties such as wool and animal hides, and on the other hand, it exports daily necessities. (1st, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">The River Continues to Rise; Various Provinces Report Floods; The Yangtze River in Anqing Has Overflowed Its Banks; The Nanchang-Xunyang Road Is Flooded and Impassable <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Wuhan rose another 1.1 chi today, and the Xiang River is rising even more rapidly. The entire Hancheng dyke on the side of Zhang Gong Dyke has collapsed, and all the fields and houses within the dyke have been submerged. Mountain floods have erupted in Chongyang, with water flowing horizontally, destroying many fields and houses, and drowning dozens of people. According to water conservancy experts, the heavy cold springs at night mean that the flood situation in Wuhan is not optimistic. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Since the middle of the month, there has been continuous rain, and mountain floods have erupted in various rivers. The floods in northern Jiangxi are the most severe. The Nanchang-Xunyang Road has been impassable due to flooding from the 26th to the 30th. Many people and livestock have been drowned in Xiushui and Wuning. The Water Conservancy Bureau and the Public Security Bureau are making every effort to rescue the refugees in the disaster areas and reinforce the dikes. The Provincial Relief Association and various charitable organizations are distributing emergency relief. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The 28th was sunny, and the water level of the Gan River fell to 1.9 zhang. On the 29th, there was heavy rain again, and today it is as cold as deep autumn. Rainfall in recent days has reached 352 millimeters, equivalent to about 100 chi of surface water, accounting for a quarter of the annual rainfall. The early rice in slightly lower areas along the river and lake is hopeless, and the dikes are precarious. Many highways and railways are flooded and closed to traffic. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) With continuous cloudy and rainy days, the river water has risen sharply. At noon on the 1st, it was 11.77 meters high, which is 1.42 meters lower than the flood level in the 20th year. The streets and lanes along the river outside the southwest gates of Anqing have been flooded. Although the sky cleared on the morning of the 1st, the water level has not slowed down. Liu Zhenhua inspected the water situation along the river bank by car at 10:00 AM. Miao Peicheng plans to go to various counties in the coming days to inspect the river dikes. The Construction Department has specially established a flood prevention committee to prepare for everything. Guangji Dyke and Weijiazui Cotton Field in the eastern part of Anqing, which have a long history, have shown signs of danger. The provincial government has specially ordered the county government to find ways to prevent and block the danger. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The flood prevention plan for the Yangtze River in Nanjing stipulates that the city of Nanjing will allocate funds for prevention and control when the water level at Xiaguan reaches 5.5 on the Customs scale. Today, the water level at Xiaguan is 5.3 on the Customs scale, only 0.2 points away from the stipulated water level of 5.5. The Public Works Bureau has drafted a flood prevention plan and budget and submitted it to the city government for approval and allocation of funds. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) It rained heavily all night in Hangzhou last night, and it is still raining lightly this morning. The Qiantang River water level was 8.35 meters this morning and 7.75 meters this afternoon, almost level with the riverbanks. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to Lanxi today, and there is no schedule for service to resume beyond this point. Commercial ferries on the Hangzhou-Yanping route are only running to Tonglu, while those on the Hangzhou-Xiaoshan route are only running to Yiqiao. The Hangzhou-Huizhou highway has suspended operations again today due to the dangerous road conditions caused by two chi of floodwater at Wangjiabu in Yuhang. The Eastern Zhejiang Highway has suffered even more damage. According to a telegram from the Fourth District Management Office of the Highway Bureau, the water level on the Dongyong, Yongjin, Jinli, Lishui, Suisong, and Yunlong roads is 7-8 chi high, and dozens of bridges and road surfaces have been washed away along the way. The Hangzhou-Wenzhou and Hangzhou-Lin'an through transport vehicles have all been suspended, with losses exceeding 100,000 yuan. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The three heavy rains here since the evening of the 29th only subsided slightly at noon on the 1st. The rainfall was 270 mm by the evening of the 30th, and had increased by another 24 mm by noon on the 1st. The Qiantang River water level soared to 8.73 meters on the morning of the 1st. Although it receded in the afternoon, it is expected to rise even higher during the high tide on the 2nd. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road was still temporarily open to Jinhua on the 1st. It will be difficult to fully restore other water and land transportation within a few days. More than a dozen counties, including Lanxi, Pujiang, Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Quzhou, Shouchang, and Longyou, have reported disasters to the province in recent days. The disaster situation is still evolving, and the extent of the losses cannot yet be calculated. (1st, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An expert from the Economic Commission said that as of last Saturday, the water level in Hankou was 41 meters, which is 1 chi higher than the water level on the same day in the 20th year. Superficially, a flood seems inevitable, but this is not necessarily the case. At the end of June in the 22nd year, the water level also exceeded the warning level by about 1 chi, but the upstream water level decreased sharply in early July, and the downstream water level also decreased. The Wuhan water level then fell sharply. Although there was a slight increase later, it did not cause a flood. It is not yet known what the situation is this year, but flood prevention work began in the Jianghan project in early last month and should not lead to danger. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

Nan Guixin resigned from the provincial committee, but after meeting with him and persuading him, he may withdraw his resignation. He does not know who the central government will send to supervise the oath ceremony. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke said that managing municipal affairs is like making clothes, and the quality depends on whether the size is appropriate. Tianjin's municipal administration has unfortunately lacked systematic planning in the past, so that management has often been inappropriate. For example, when repairing roads, the slopes are often uneven, and even water accumulates in the center of the street when it is overcast. Therefore, this time, when changing the director of the Public Works Bureau, the first thing to do is to draw a city map so that facilities can be built according to the map. In addition, (1) the Tianjin-Tanggu highway has been approved and permitted by the Beining Railway Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau is responsible for designing and building it quickly. This road and the Hai River have the same effect of prospering Tianjin's commerce. (2) The former plan for the special zone power plant required a 2,500-watt generator. Tianjin is limited by the treaty, and the power plant can only supply electricity to one corner of the city. There is no need for such a large generator. It is planned to wait for experts to review it before deciding how to build it. (3) Nankai experts have been commissioned to study various famous cities and create accurate statistical reports and regulations for the Tianjin Municipal Government organization, which will then be submitted to the central government for approval. The central government's emphasis on the four sanitary constructions is extremely important. It is planned to improve the municipal hospital so that it can truly benefit the common people.

<h3 id="e20">Discussion After the Implementation of New Laws <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Mother</p>
<p>The laws of a nation are originally intended to enhance the welfare of the people. Therefore, laws that benefit the people are enacted, and those that harm the people are abolished. The revision of laws in our country began in the late Qing Dynasty and has continued for thirty years. However, the people have yet to fully experience the benefits of the law. Consequently, those who discuss politics are striving to find ways to improve the situation, hoping to establish the rule of law.</p>
<p>The recently promulgated Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and Civil Procedure Law all came into effect yesterday. The most important aspect of this legal reform is the change from a four-level, three-instance system to a three-level, three-instance system. This is because there are only three levels of courts, and a fourth level is merely symbolic. It is better to directly and clearly change it to three levels. This is a practical and accurate change, and there is no reason to object. However, the true spirit of the law always lies in people who can genuinely abide by the law and apply it effectively. Furthermore, the implementation of a law is related to all aspects of administration and various facilities. Although our country's laws are not yet perfect, if they can be effectively implemented, they can still achieve some results. However, the effects obtained so far have been minimal. This is because the laws themselves are not entirely suitable, but more importantly, law enforcement officials have failed to deeply understand the true intentions of the legislators.</p>
<p>Let's consider the Criminal Law. Security measures are emphasized for social defense and are modeled after new systems in various countries. However, security measures require adequate facilities, such as reformatory and educational institutions, many of which have not yet been established. After the implementation of the new Criminal Law, if a judge imposes a security measure on a criminal, how will it be enforced? How will it be used for reform? Furthermore, where will individuals who commit crimes due to drunkenness be transferred for execution? These arrangements urgently need to be made to achieve the true purpose of reform and to align with the true spirit of security measures.</p>
<p>Next, let's discuss the Criminal Procedure Law. It pays close attention to the protection of human rights, specifically by strictly limiting the time for judicial police agencies to transfer suspects to within 24 hours, imposing restrictions on the detention of suspects, and expanding the scope of private prosecution. It is true that the long-term detention of suspects by police agencies has its drawbacks. However, investigative matters cannot be completely separated from the police agencies. Therefore, while strictly limiting the time for transfer, attention should still be paid to the daily work of the police agencies. Furthermore, the expansion of the scope of private prosecution is not without its drawbacks. For example, in the Shanghai International Settlement, private prosecution was not limited to the primary level or personal reporting, which often led to opportunistic litigation and extortion. Once their scheme succeeded, they would withdraw the case. Although it is now impossible to arbitrarily withdraw a private prosecution, this is only a passive measure. The most painful aspect of criminal cases is for the defendant, and the most painful experience for the defendant is detention. Once a respectable person is imprisoned, even if the case is eventually cleared, the immediate losses are irreparable. Moreover, once it is spread around that someone is a criminal defendant, regardless of guilt or innocence, the person's reputation is largely damaged. Now that the scope of private prosecution has been expanded, it is difficult to guarantee that litigious individuals will not abuse the system. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to Article 318 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates that "the private prosecutor and the defendant shall be questioned before the first trial date." In particular, for cases with bizarre circumstances, the private prosecutor should be strictly interrogated to prevent unreasonable litigation. For the defendant, if there is no obvious guilt, there is no need to detain or require bail to avoid mental suffering.</p>
<p>Next, let's discuss the Civil Procedure Law. This law aims to prevent intentional delays in the litigation process and to implement mediation before the filing of a lawsuit. This does not delay the progress of the case and provides the people with an opportunity for reconciliation. Furthermore, the increased use of provisional execution and restrictions on the third instance are all aimed at expediting the conclusion of lawsuits. This can alleviate the suffering of lengthy delays by fifty to sixty percent. However, one point needs attention: the amount for simple cases is stipulated as 800 yuan, and for appeals to the third instance, the benefit must exceed 500 yuan. It can also be ordered to be reduced to 300 yuan or increased to 1,000 yuan. Therefore, the first instance of simple cases should thoroughly investigate the rights and wrongs to ensure that those without reason do not intentionally delay, hoping to get lucky. This will allow the spirit of the newly promulgated law to be fully realized, and the people can truly benefit from it.</p>
<p>In summary, the reform of these laws cannot be said to be without progress. However, the most important point lies in the people who implement the laws. As the saying goes, "There are people who govern, not laws that govern." I dare not say that laws are useless. However, without the right people, the spirit of the law can be lost, and even the provisions of the law can be manipulated. In a society with declining morals and treacherous hearts, those who hold the power to seize the lives, freedom, property, and reputation of the people should sharpen their minds and be fair and impartial. In the early stages of implementing the new law during a transitional period, leniency should be shown to those whose crimes are excusable. If this is done, the effect of the rule of law can be achieved.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan on June 27 to discuss a resolution to the conflict between Japanese and Russian troops at Yangmaoling (transliterated) northwest of Mishan on June 3. The Japanese government hopes that the Soviet Russian government will propose concrete suggestions for resolution. During the talks, Foreign Minister Hirota told the Soviet Russian Ambassador that Soviet Russia currently has 200,000 troops stationed on the Russian-"Manchukuo" border. He requested that Soviet Russia voluntarily reduce this number by one-third or one-half so that relations between Russia, "Manchukuo," and Japan can return to normal. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, formally protested to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today regarding the first incident of "Manchukuo" troops invading Russian territory. It is expected that there will be further protests regarding other border incursions. According to announcements here, Soviet Russian border guards did not fire their weapons during any of the incidents, as Russia is willing to maintain peace at all costs. However, the Soviet Russian Embassy in Japan is determined to ascertain whether these actions by Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops are under the orders of the Commander of the Kwantung Army or are independent actions. According to non-official circles here, if the Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops are acting under orders, then these actions will be viewed as an attempt by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" sides to provoke war.

<p>(Washington) Congress previously passed the next fiscal year's defense budget in April, approving appropriations of 860 million yuan, including plans to expand the army and navy. This will be implemented when the fiscal year begins on July 1st. The conscription office will handle the recruitment. It is estimated that 47,000 army personnel, 11,000 navy personnel, and 1,100 marines will need to be recruited. The army should complete this recruitment within three years, and the navy within four years. When the recruitment is completed in the future, the total number of new troops nationwide will be 165,000 for the army, 93,500 for the navy, and 16,000 for the marines. Although the number of army personnel has been increased, it is only to replenish the existing personnel of each unit and is not intended to establish new units. The newly recruited navy personnel will be assigned to the warships newly built this year (according to this year, the United States is building 24 warships). According to President Roosevelt's instructions, those who are members of the "Civilian Conservation Corps," established under the Works Progress Administration, may not be recruited, as these corps members were established to address the unemployment problem and should not be used to fill the ranks of the "regular army."

<p>(London) Undersecretary of State Eden presented to the House of Commons today on the experiences of visiting Paris and Rome. He stated that the purpose of his trip was to sincerely explain the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to the French government and to discuss methods of proceeding with the matters mentioned in the London Communiqué of February 3, as well as to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Mussolini stated that he could not accept the British suggestions regarding a final resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. The British suggestion was that the United Kingdom cede a portion of British Somaliland to Ethiopia to provide access to the sea. The United Kingdom made this suggestion to facilitate any territorial and economic concessions that Ethiopia might make to Italy in the negotiated solution. The United Kingdom, in addition to seeking watering and grazing rights for tribes within any territories that Ethiopia might cede to Italy, did not wish to request any other concessions as compensation. The United Kingdom took this attitude not out of self-interest or to protect the interests of the British in Africa, but because the United Kingdom is a member of the League of Nations and is willing to resolve disputes. He told Mussolini that British foreign policy is based entirely on the League of Nations. The result of his talks with Mussolini and French Prime Minister Laval is that the three parties are currently seeking ways to cooperate in fulfilling the sections listed in the London Communiqué of February 3. There is now reason to hope that the best approach can be found in the near future. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) A London correspondent for Le Matin analyzed the unease among British people regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, stating in brief: "A proverb says that Egypt is the Nile, and the Nile is Egypt, which shows the importance of the Nile River to Egypt. However, the Nile River waterway is formed by the confluence of various water sources in the Ethiopian highlands. All the streams within Ethiopia flow towards Egypt, making Egypt a naturally rich country. Without the water source from Ethiopia, the Nile River waterway would be dry for a significant portion of the year. The Nile River is divided into two major tributaries, one is the Blue Nile, and the other is the White Nile. The Blue Nile originates from Lake Tana, flows through west-central Ethiopia, meanders into Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and joins the White Nile. Therefore, in recent years, engineering experts have repeatedly designed to build dikes around Lake Tana to raise the water level of Lake Tana to prevent the Blue Nile's water source from drying up. Once the Lake Tana water dike project is completed, it will benefit the agricultural irrigation in the Blue Nile region no less than the famous dike built by the British in Aswan, Egypt. For this reason, if the country controlling the Blue Nile's water source can cooperate with other countries involved, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan water conservancy will naturally not have to worry about being depleted. It is said that when British Lord Privy Seal Eden went to Rome, he suggested various plans to assist Italy in developing trade in Ethiopia. His intention was to protect the Blue Nile's water source, so he tried his best to seek Italy's understanding." (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<p>Frankfurt – A report from the press explains the future of Franco-German relations and important discussions promoting understanding between the two countries, saying that a Paris correspondent reported the speech of Mr. Piéllingue, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Piéllingue's speech was based on Hitler's recent important diplomatic and political declaration, stating that if substantial results are desired, the first thing is to not dwell on past grievances. Only by not dwelling on past grievances can the current difficulties be resolved. The Saar vote has completely resolved the land dispute. Chancellor Hitler has repeatedly stated this to the German people and the world. Important figures of the New Germany, such as Hess, Göring, Frick, Goebbels, and Ribbentrop, have also made similar declarations. We have no reason to doubt this guarantee. I personally do not want to delve into their sincerity for a moment, but the principle of recognizing territorial sovereignty should also be applied to French colonies. It is especially appreciated that the German government abides by the Locarno Pact, which guarantees peace in Western Europe. The German people are deeply afraid that invoking the Franco-Soviet Pact signed on May 2 will narrow the scope of the Locarno Pact. The French government will take steps to dispel German unease. Mr. Piéllingue continued, saying that he is well aware of Germany's position regarding the French treaty system. It is not difficult for us to understand that the German government does not want to join a treaty that would inadvertently involve it in war. In short, Germany has no intention of sacrificing a single soldier for such a war. Many French politicians disagree with the current treaty system. I have been one of them since I published my reasons for opposition in the summer of 1934, he said. Mr. Piéllingue believes that the Austrian question is not an insurmountable difficulty, saying that Germany has no right to demand the annexation of Austria. At this point, the correspondent said that the German government only demands that German expatriates in Austria should enjoy the right of self-determination. Mr. Piéllingue admitted that he had no objection to this. Regarding the arms issue, Mr. Piéllingue strongly advocated that both sides should have the freedom to act as they deem appropriate, and said that only strength can command respect, but this does not preclude the possibility of equality in armaments between the two countries. Regarding this matter, France is willing to fairly consider any proposal put forward by Germany. Mr. Piéllingue concluded by saying that Europe used to be in a position to lead the world, but after the war, it was almost reduced to a second-rate position. Like Hitler, I am an optimist and do not believe in the decline of Europe, but in the revival of Europe. To seek the revival of Europe, major powers must cooperate to maintain lasting peace. Regarding this point, France and Germany have a common goal and a vast field for cooperation in the economic sphere, (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, newspapers are speculating about the possibility of negotiations between France and Germany. Le Journal said that starting negotiations with Germany carries the risk of undermining the Stresa Front. This issue must be considered first. Furthermore, it is impossible to predict what contribution Germany can make to such negotiations. Judging from the situation, it is absolutely impossible for France and Germany to establish an agreement like the Anglo-German agreement. Although Hitler mentioned the issue of disarmament when he attended Congress on May 21, his wording was vague and did not specifically address the issue of Franco-German arms reduction. Moreover, given Germany's current military strength, it is extremely unlikely to establish such an understanding with Germany. Therefore, the newspaper believes that instead of direct Franco-German negotiations, a conference on general European issues should be convened. Even if direct negotiations are desired, opinions should first be exchanged through ordinary diplomatic channels. Le Temps stated that direct negotiations were favored by Briand. German newspapers have said that trust requires courage, which is an irrefutable truth. What we need is to trust ourselves, and then ask for Germany's opinion. If we rely on the British as intermediaries for diplomacy in everything, what good will it do? (National Telegram on the 1st)</p>

<p>(Paris) The newspapers of the left-wing parties are now unanimously publishing a declaration, calling on the people of the country to unite on the National Day of July 14 to defend the people's freedom. A total of 48 political groups have signed this declaration, including the Radical Socialist Party, the League of Human Rights, and various political groups of Communism, Marxism, and Syndicalism, as well as veterans' organizations. All anti-fascist political groups are participating. The content of the declaration briefly states that July 14, 1789, is the anniversary of the French people's capture of the Bastille, and also the anniversary of the French people's establishment of freedom for the world. This kind of freedom has been strengthened and maintained to this day through more than 150 years of unremitting efforts and four bloody revolutions. Now it is in danger of being eliminated by the Fascist Party. These people are willing to destroy our French democratic politics for the benefit of more than two hundred special families, and replace it with a dictatorial regime. We hereby request the people of the country to gather all their strength to resist the arrogance of big financiers and special classes.

<p>Valencia, Spain – The local Federation of the People's Action Party initiated a grand gathering, with over 125,000 participants. It was presided over by the party leader, Minister of the Army Robles, alongside cabinet members and members of parliament affiliated with the party from various regions. They arrived in 50 train cars, 1,000 buses, and numerous private cars. They gathered at the local national cattle market and football field, where speeches were broadcast via radio. Order at the venue was maintained by members of the party's youth corps, which was excellent. These members all wore uniforms with shirts made of yellow cloth, and saluted by raising their right hands to the left shoulder. Fearing that opposition groups would stage demonstrations and cause disputes, the authorities dispatched security teams carrying machine guns in numerous trucks to patrol everywhere to prevent any accidents. The scale of this gathering was truly rare in Spain. Minister of Communications Roussia delivered a speech, saying, "What Spain needs now are true talents who serve God and the country, not cowardly people. The People's Action Party is not afraid of revolution, but is prepared to stop the left-wing's revolutionary actions to incite the people." Robles then took the stage and said, "The People's Action Party and the Radical Party led by Premier Lerroux have formed an alliance in Salamanca last Sunday." (Note: Lerroux delivered a speech there last Sunday, saying that he would maintain the unity of the government majority, while Robles said that he accepted the republican system with a sincere attitude.) However, although I and Premier Lerroux have signed an alliance, both parties still maintain their original theories and have not abandoned them. In the past, revolutionary tides swept the country, and the Spanish national spirit and material values were in danger of being destroyed. The country was in danger, so we resolutely took on the responsibility of saving the country in order to preserve the foundation of the country. I dare say that the agreement between the People's Action Party and the Radical Party is a strong fortress to prevent revolution." Robles then explained the political program of the right-wing and central factions' group: (1) to do everything possible to eliminate the revolutionary spirit that launched the rebellion in October 1934; (2) to reform the administrative organs and create a clean and frugal government; (3) to reform the constitution. No incidents occurred until the end of the meeting. The venue of this gathering was the same place where former left-wing Republican Prime Minister Azaña gave a speech to over 60,000 people, only a few weeks apart, (Havas Telegram on the 30th)</p>

<p>Chengdu Air News, June 14th, 9:00 AM: The fourth Expanded Memorial Week presided over by Chairman Chiang in Chengdu was held. Attendees included Chairman Chiang, Secretary-General Yang, Director He, Director Kang, Chairman Liu, General Liu, military generals, party and government personnel, and representatives from all sectors of the public, totaling over one thousand people. After Chairman Chiang led the attendees in performing the rituals, Chairman Chiang delivered the following address:</p>
<p>"Chairman Liu, fellow comrades, today we are holding the fourth Memorial Week for the Premier here, and it is also the fourth time I have spoken publicly in Chengdu. Now, I will first reiterate the main points of my previous three speeches, and everyone should seriously reflect on them. The first speech concerned my mission in coming to Sichuan this time, which was not solely to suppress the Red bandits, but to inform the responsible leaders of all sectors in Sichuan about how to invigorate themselves, strengthen themselves, and fulfill their duties in the future. On the one hand, we must enable the people of Sichuan Province to fulfill their individual responsibilities, so that progress can be made day by day in politics, the military, society, and all other aspects. I also specifically offered the five words 'public,' 'sincere,' 'simple,' 'unskillful,' and 'strict' as sincere advice to everyone, taking them as the fundamental ways to uplift people's hearts, change the social atmosphere, govern politics and the military, and build Sichuan to save the nation. The key to whether Sichuan is well-governed or in chaos, and whether the nation survives or perishes, lies entirely in this. Everyone must strive to practice this in order to accomplish our mission and achieve the goals of the revolution. The second speech was to inform the leaders of all sectors that bandit suppression must adhere to the principle of 'three parts military, seven parts politics,' and fully leverage the power of politics. To leverage the power of politics, we must also leverage the power of the people. If everyone can work hard according to this, no matter how strong the Red bandits are, it will not be difficult for us to eliminate them. Therefore, not only should the military love and protect the people and intensify the organization and training of the people wherever they go, but the leaders of all sectors of the people must also shoulder this responsibility even more. The principle of 'using the people is better than using soldiers, teaching the people should be like teaching soldiers' should be applied to bandit suppression, resisting foreign insults, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. Because the number of people is large and they are everywhere, as long as we organize and train them, we can exert the greatest power, and utilizing them is much more convenient than utilizing the military. However, to use the people, we must first save the people, and training the people must be like training the military, so that they can share life and death and adversity with us, and devote their efforts to the work of bandit suppression and resisting foreign insults. The third speech was to say that the leaders of all sectors individually bear the responsibility of education. Because we want to uplift people's hearts, change the social atmosphere, and enable all citizens in society to cultivate both morality and skills, achieve success, and attain the goals of revolution and national salvation, we must focus on implementing education that combines both literary and military aspects. The education in literary schools should take martial arts as its main foundation, and the education in the military should also take literary matters as its important content, so as to ensure that every citizen becomes a versatile talent who is both literate and martial. Especially martial arts education, which is even more important in today's national crisis. If the people do not understand martial arts, then it is not education for saving the country. Therefore, to be a modern citizen, one must have the cultivation of martial arts. To make education effective, there must be martial arts training. Moreover, martial arts education not only focuses on martial arts, but also needs to cultivate the martial virtues of 'wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness.' As for general education, it should take the 'six arts' as its main content. Only in this way can we achieve holistic education. Only this kind of education can save the country. The words I have spoken in the previous three times are all fundamental ways to suppress bandits, govern Sichuan, and carry out revolution to save the country. They are also the most important principles for you to follow as leaders, officials, and teachers. Everyone, please carefully reflect on whether you have wholeheartedly and earnestly done as I said in the past three weeks. Today, I will continue to talk to you about the key points of educating the people and changing customs, and I hope everyone will pay special attention. Everyone must know what education is. It is a means of teaching people how to be people and how to succeed in their careers. If a country or a society does not have good education, it will not be able to create perfect talents and good customs and cultures, nor will it be able to build a new society and a strong country. Now, if we want to change the social atmosphere, strengthen the people, build a new society, and save the country from danger, we must focus on the education of the people. Besides the combination of literary and military skills that I talked about last time, which should be earnestly put into practice, the leaders of all sectors who are responsible for education, whether literary or military, must understand the entire relationship of national education. The most important thing is to know what the relationship with the people is. Whether we are soldiers or ordinary people, we are the same person. Why is one called a soldier and the other called a civilian? Is it because a person is called a soldier when they wear a military hat, military uniform, and carry a gun, and otherwise they are called a civilian? This is just a slight difference in form. In fact, soldiers and civilians were originally one entity, and there is no absolute difference. Anyone can be a soldier, and any soldier is a civilian. In ancient times in our country, soldiers were embedded in agriculture. When the country was in trouble, everyone had the obligation to be a soldier. When the country was at peace, everyone would return to their fields. It can be seen that soldiers are civilians and civilians are soldiers, and there is no distinction between soldiers and civilians. Since soldiers and civilians are one entity, the education that is given should of course be the same. However, once a person becomes a soldier, the responsibilities they bear are more serious than those of ordinary people. Because their responsibilities are more serious, only citizens with superior moral character and skills can be soldiers. From this, it can be seen that the education of soldiers must be higher than that of ordinary people, and ordinary people are the source of soldiers. That is why I often say that good citizens are the foundation of good soldiers, and good soldiers are the model of good citizens. If a country does not have good people, it will not have good soldiers, and without good soldiers, it will certainly not be able to form a sound army. We must have good people in order to produce a good army. At the same time, because soldiers bear greater responsibilities than ordinary people, their character, intelligence, and the spirit of sacrifice of 'forgetting the family for the country,' 'forgetting the self for the public,' and 'courageously doing what is right' should also be higher than that of ordinary people. Therefore, soldiers should be models for ordinary people. If soldiers and the entire army are really this good, then ordinary people can of course be directly and indirectly influenced by them in tangible and intangible ways, and have the same noble character, perfect intelligence, and spirit of public service as our soldiers, so that they can fight alongside our army and complete the cause of national salvation and rejuvenation. Therefore, if we want to truly train good soldiers and make our country strong, we must first find ways to educate the people of the whole country and make them excellent modern citizens. However, to achieve this quickly, in addition to the leaders of all sectors of the people working hard to train them through educational methods, the military must also take on this responsibility.

<h3 id="e75">Liu Xiang Announces the Guidelines for the Governance of Sichuan Province <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Establish New Systems to Gradually Purify Local Administration, Save Money and Ensure Fiscal Balance.</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The Red bandits on the North and South routes are being pursued and attacked relentlessly by the Central Army and various Sichuan bandit suppression forces. They are increasingly cornered in the barren areas of western Sichuan. Most of the counties they previously occupied have been recovered. The Xu bandits only hold Mao County, Wenchuan, and Liban three counties, while the Zhu Mao bandits only hold Danleng and Lian gong two places. Western Sichuan is poor and materially difficult. The Yi people in the mountains deeply hate the bandits. The bandits are trapped in a large encirclement by government troops and have lost their ability to plunder. They have no chance of survival. The Sichuan Provincial Government has also decided to move to Chengdu at the beginning of next month. Deng Mingjie, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, recently telegraphed from the province, instructing the Provincial Government to move part of its staff on the 10th of next month. All departments are currently preparing for the move to the west. Chairman Liu of the Provincial Government has recently announced the guidelines for this year's administration and provided explanations, outlining new measures in civil administration, finance, construction, education, and security, which are extremely practical. The following is a record:</p>
<p>"Since the reorganization of the Sichuan Provincial Government, several months have passed in a flash. Although government orders have gradually moved towards unification, there are still many problems to be addressed and shortcomings to be overcome. We are unable to achieve anything due to the difficulty of managing things. Considering the current situation in Sichuan, which has become the focus of national attention, and the expectations of all parties for us, which are far-reaching and significant, although we may not be able to achieve success overnight to meet the urgent needs of the people, we should still overcome all difficulties and work step by step to seek gradual progress. We should make monthly plans and instruct the various departments of the government to formulate guidelines based on their respective duties, the urgent needs of the current situation, and in accordance with laws and regulations, to serve as a fixed schedule for the year. In terms of civil administration, we should first establish political systems to adapt to the new environment, then train talents and implement new laws and regulations. Within a year, we must ensure that the local administrative sector gradually evolves, eliminating the corrupt and chaotic images of the past, so that the people can have a fresh perspective. In terms of finance, we should reorganize finance, establish treasuries, and adhere to the principle of living within our means, with unified revenue and expenditure as a fixed schedule. We should establish a financial reorganization committee to plan and discuss reforms, and implement financial transparency. Within this year, even if we dare not expect to increase revenue quickly, we should do our best to reduce expenditure to achieve financial stability and balance revenue and expenditure. In terms of construction, we should improve agriculture, develop transportation, improve local products, and utilize the power of the people within the scope of our human and financial resources. As for large-scale light and heavy industries, we should start with preparation and investigation and avoid rushing to create a facade to avoid waste and ensure practical results. In terms of education, we should reduce redundant departments, reorganize education funding, enrich school content, establish more vocational schools, and implement cooperation between construction and education to ensure that learning is useful and that what is learned is applied. We should strive to eliminate the empty and scattered malpractices of the past and establish a robust and practical style of learning within this year, improve the bad habits of young people, recover bandit areas, implement special education to correct deteriorated thinking, and cultivate national consciousness to guide students' trends. In terms of security, we should follow the major guidelines for improvement issued by Chairman Chiang, consider the current situation in Sichuan, unify funding, streamline staffing, strictly train, and clear up local group contributions in various counties to ensure that the people have practical self-defense benefits. The above outline is by no means a far-reaching plan. If we can implement it effectively, we will not make any major mistakes. My humble intention is to show sincerity with simplicity rather than using empty talk to buy favor. The reason why I must list the main points and make them public is to encourage mutual restraint and accelerate the self-motivation of my colleagues. I do not want to rigidly adhere to small achievements and be complacent. As the saying goes, 'A high platform rises from accumulated earth, and a journey of a hundred miles begins with a single step.' The items listed above are like a drop in the ocean. In terms of the future of politics, it is far away. Since I have served my hometown for many years, I have drifted with the tide and wasted years, failing to make active contributions to benefit my homeland. Now, I have encountered an opportunity to reverse the situation, and I dare not be slack or miss this opportunity. Regardless of whether we should start with reforming politics to transform Sichuan, even if we are only dedicated to completing the bandit suppression work, it will not succeed without exerting the function of politics and military affairs in parallel. However, I am aware of my own limited abilities and may not be able to reverse the situation, but my determination to fill the sea with earth has not changed. My sincere heart should be understood by all. I hope that all my elders and brothers in Sichuan will uphold the spirit of mutual concern and advance hand in hand with sincerity, making progress day by day and working diligently to achieve success, so that what I say today will all be put into practice within a year, which will be the shared glory of our homeland. In addition to submitting special reports to the central government, I will summarize the purpose of formulating the implementation guidelines for the provincial government this year for the reference of all my fellow villagers. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government."</p>
<h3 id="e76">River Water Continues to Rise: Hanyang Embankment Collapses: Entire Seventy Li of Hancheng Embankment Collapses, Flooding Thousands of Acres of Land: Several Breaches in Huangpi Minsheng Embankment, Also in Imminent Danger <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The river water is rising rapidly day by day, and the situation is tense. The people of Wuhan are trembling with fear. The great flood of twenty years ago caused great pain, leading to a change in the color of the water. The dikes in Wuhan are generally solid, but some projects are poorly built and difficult to guarantee, which is unavoidable. Yesterday, outside the Zhanggong Dike, the Hancheng Embankment in Hanyang, which stretches for more than seventy li, completely collapsed in the heavy rain, flooding more than ten thousand acres of land. This is the first dike collapse of the year. The founder of the embankment was Li Jiehou, a local gentry. He did not make precise plans in advance. The estimated cost of the project was 200,000 yuan, which was submitted to the Construction Department for approval, and the county magistrate was assigned to be responsible for supervising the construction. It was stipulated that part of the funds would be raised locally, and part would be advanced by the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee. However, after construction began, there were no funds to raise locally, so the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee took on the task alone. Because the amount borrowed exceeded the agreed amount, supply could not meet demand, and all projects could not proceed according to the procedures, stopping and starting intermittently. From last year to this spring, only half of the project was completed. After the peach blossoms flooded, the water level gradually rose, and the officials and gentry responsible for supervising the construction began to panic. They decided to conscript laborers to speed up the construction in the hope of completing it as soon as possible. However, the procedures for conscripting laborers were extremely cumbersome. In the middle of this month, sixty to seventy people were conscripted, and they worked for several days until the continuous heavy rain. On the 21st, a section of Tajiatou first reported a collapse, and another section collapsed on the 23rd. Yesterday, it completely collapsed and could not be saved. More than ten thousand acres of farmland were flooded, and the construction cost of more than 200,000 yuan was completely washed away. In addition, the Minsheng Embankment, located outside the Zhanggong Dike in Huangpi County, has been under construction for seven or eight years. Several breaches have now occurred, and the situation is precarious. If the water level rises further, it may also collapse. (30th)</p>

<p>Gu Zhiming, a former police officer, was originally from Huaian, where he farmed for a living. Unaccustomed to public service, he resigned and moved his family to a village about three li south of Lita Hui Town in this county, where he rented land to farm, returning to his old occupation. His son studied barbering. His son's name was Baojun, and he was nineteen years old. He currently works in a tea house owned by the Zhu family in the town, which is enough to make a living. Recently, due to the hot weather, Jiang Peigen and Shen Achuan from the Tianyitang pharmacy invited Baojun to bathe in the Changshan River. The river was newly completed. Gu had no knowledge of swimming. Once he entered the water, he was panting, sweating, and physically exhausted. When he reached the center of the river, he tragically drowned. Companions Jiang and Shen, seeing that disaster had struck, returned without regard for him. Gu Zhiming was very saddened upon hearing the report and reported it to the nearby public security branch. Jiang Peigen and Shen Achuan were summoned to the bureau. After preliminary interrogation, they have been transferred to the local court for review. It is reported that Gu Baojun's body has not yet been retrieved.</p>

According to the interrogation, they were smuggling salt, named Zhang Shijian, Gao Fugui, and Huang Zhanyuan. However, the three people's statements differed, so they were taken to the bureau for detention pending investigation.</p>

<p>All levels of courts in Jiangsu Province have been ordered to implement a three-level, three-trial system from July 1st. The summary courts and collegial panels of each court will be abolished. In the future, second-instance cases will be handled by the High Court. The Chief Prosecutor must personally investigate the cases. The number of appealed cases to the High Court will inevitably increase, and it is planned to establish a third civil court. However, due to personnel selection and procedural issues, it has not been possible to implement this yet. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice and Administration for approval. It is also reported that from the 1st, the office hours of each court will be changed to 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 mu of lake land in East Taihu Lake have been enclosed by guest residents. The county government was ordered to dismantle the enclosures, but the construction was solid and could not be dismantled immediately. It is now known that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially dispatched Gu Qiao if Jia Su to re-survey. After Gu arrived in Suzhou, he contacted Wu County Chief and local figures such as Zhang Yipeng. Committee member Gu prepared to go to East Taihu Lake to conduct an on-site survey on the morning of the 1st, accompanied by Section Chief Dong and clerk Wang from the county government in a motorboat. He will return to Suzhou that night and convene a meeting with local figures on the 2nd. On the 3rd, he will go to Wujiang to contact Xu County Chief of Wujiang County on everything. It is reported that Committee member Gu intends to prepare a plan after completing the survey and submit it to the province for review in order to fundamentally resolve the issue.</p>

<p>The situation of the Liuyu River bank being repeatedly eroded by the river waves recently, it is now known that the river mouth on the 30th, due to the extremely strong southwest wind, the river flow along the Zhenjiang car ferry terminal area was unusually rapid. At 4:30 p.m., when the sixth downstream car arrived at the South Station, the flow was even more rapid. The newly padded wharf in front of the pontoon boat showed cracks again. When the ferry arrived at the port, the flow was too strong and the vortex too deep. After several twists and turns, it was able to dock on the shore.

<p>The Murderer Has Been Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate for Legal Action</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) On the 30th of this month, Qiu Chao-shui, a Taiwanese on Xiatin Fanjiang Houlu in this city, stabbed to death Zhang Jinhe, a soldier of the 494th Regiment of the 83rd Division stationed at the Provincial Office. Zhang and his colleague Ye Dexiang took monkeys to Yunzhang Road on the morning of the 30th. Unexpectedly, the monkey's paw suddenly grabbed the corner of Taiwanese Qiu Chao-yong's clothes. Qiu began to scold him and then started to beat him. Zhang refused to show weakness. Qiu then took a pig knife from Zhao Chang Foreign Firm and stabbed Zhang Jinhe in the back four times. Zhang Jinhe immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Qiu saw that the situation was not good and fled into Zhenli Foreign Firm. Qi Dexiang saw that Zhang Jinhe was seriously injured and ran to report to the police, and reported to the office. The detectives of the Public Security Bureau, led by Captain Dong Lan Guan, went to investigate in person. Knowing the whereabouts of the murderer, he notified the port police department by telephone. At the same time, he led the team to monitor the vicinity of Zhenhe Foreign Firm with police officers. Japanese Police Chief Liu Dehe led several Japanese police officers to arrive. The Japanese police entered the building to search. The murderer Qiu Chao-yong jumped down from the upper floor and was arrested by the Japanese police. Qiu's clothes and pants still had blood stains. He was interrogated in the company. He confessed that he was 24 years old, from 33 Yutian-cho 2-chome, Keelung City, Taiwan. He arrived in Xiamen on the Fengshan Maru on March 7 this year, and arrived in Fuzhou on the Hai Ning Maru from Xiamen on April 1, staying in Zhao Chang Foreign Firm or Man Tai Foreign Firm. Because the deceased's monkey grabbed my clothes, I had an argument with him. I took a pig knife from Zhao Chang Foreign Firm and stabbed the deceased in the back, causing his death. After the interrogation, the Japanese Police Chief took the murderer back to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation in accordance with the law. (1st Central News Agency telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the fourteen-article outline for the management of sugar transportation and sales are announced. Sugar for transportation and sales refers to refined sugar, crude sugar, syrup, and sucrose containing 50% or more. The Management Committee may entrust a Chinese-national sugar company jointly run by officials and merchants to handle sugar purchase and sale affairs. The sugar company may entrust legitimate sugar merchants in major commercial ports and various places as sales managers to operate the sugar transportation and sales business in their respective areas. The sugar purchased by the sugar company should be stored in customs warehouses or designated bonded warehouses, and may not be withdrawn without paying national tax. When purchasing foreign sugar, the sugar company should purchase it according to the world's lowest market price and the principle of competitive bidding. All domestic sugar material planters and sugar manufacturers should register the type and quantity with the Management Committee. Sugar merchants in various places who sell sugar may, if necessary, petition the Management Committee to request the Ministry of Finance and local authorities to assist in the search for smuggled sugar. If any are seized, bonuses will be given according to a percentage. (1st special telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chao-chun told someone that the capital city government's budget estimate for the 24th year (of the Republic) had been reviewed by the Executive Yuan and would be submitted to a meeting for discussion. This year's budget emphasizes the urgent need to promote and complete various municipal constructions, so the project expenses have increased by about two million yuan. Among them, the expenses for promoting education, providing relief to refugees, constructing sewers, and handling land registration account for the majority. The education expense accounts for the most, about 900,000 yuan. Since July and August are the beginning of the school term, about nearly 700,000 yuan is needed to cover the construction expenses of various schools. The time is pressing, so more than 200,000 yuan has already been raised in advance to start the work immediately. As for the increased and insufficient amounts, the fundraising policy will be determined based on the needs. Regarding the issuance of public bonds, it seems that there is no such intention at present. In the future, it is planned to refer to commercial loans to raise funds, with the principle of reducing the burden on the people and meeting economic conditions. Regarding the issue of industrial and commercial loans, the city government decided to start by enriching the small loan office, extending the loan business, and promoting interest-free loans for the poor from one yuan to five yuan. Regarding the preparation for the establishment of the Municipal Council, because the local autonomy of the capital city has not yet been completed, the city government is promoting it with reference to the implementation of the city, hoping to make the district administration of each district sound and establish the Municipal Council within this year.

<h3 id="e114">Shanghai City: Compulsory Literacy Education Began Yesterday, Over 60,000 Illiterates Enthusiastically Enrolled <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reported that the compulsory literacy education in this city has been implemented since yesterday. The first phase of 220 municipal literacy schools have all opened separately. The Literacy Education Committee has an inspection plan, and the mayor has also organized a secret investigation team to visit various schools to inspect the teaching situation at any time. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The First Phase of Literacy Schools Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Except for the three districts of Luxing, Gaoxing, and Zhenru, which are purely rural areas and inconvenient to open schools during the busy season, the remaining 19 districts have established schools according to the situation in each district, ranging from two to thirty schools, totaling 220 schools, all of which opened simultaneously yesterday and held simple ceremonies separately. The directors and teachers of each school reported. Yesterday, the reporter visited the literacy schools in the two urban areas of South Shanghai and Zhabei. The principals of each school borrowed temples, ancestral halls, public offices, schools, institutions, and groups, etc. The school names were all called Shanghai Municipal XX Road Literacy School, with white characters on a black background, inscribed by Mayor Wu. The people who were required to enroll all enrolled enthusiastically without fear. Although the clothing was not uniform, it was still neat. Most of them were coolies, and they were also polite to the teachers and had a strong interest. Tao, the director-general of the association, visited various schools and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Strictly Established Inspection Methods</p>
<p>In order to assess and supervise the diligence of teachers in the literacy schools in each district, and to provide guidance at any time, the Literacy Education Committee has assigned four inspectors to rotate to visit. Mayor Wu also compiled a secret investigation team among the civil servants to secretly assign them to various districts for investigation. In addition, the offices in each district formed an academic affairs committee with enthusiastic educators to be responsible for supervision. The literacy schools will still have classes on Sundays and will not have holidays. The Literacy Education Committee has specially stipulated substitute teaching methods. Every ten schools (that is, ten teachers) will have one substitute teacher, who will substitute for each teacher for two days each month, so that the teachers in each school can rest for two days each month. The district offices will propose four substitute teachers, and the Literacy Education Committee will select one of them for employment. In addition to substituting for 20 days each month, the substitute teachers will also be responsible for inspection, so the supervision of each school has been very strict.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Awards School Supplies</p>
<p>The students' school supplies are a Big Leather pencil and a paper notebook, totaling four cents, which students should purchase from the school. However, if the family is poor and never absent from class, or the absence does not exceed one-sixth, and the grades are above B, they will all be awarded by the municipal government. It is heard that the municipal government has prepared 200,000 copies, and the textbooks for students will all be given away and will not be charged.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reported that yesterday was the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. All institutions, groups, schools, shops, and factories in the city flew flags to celebrate. The municipal government held an enlarged memorial week yesterday morning. Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government, and reported on the recent situation of the rectification of public security affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mayor Wu Went to the Municipal Government Office Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, had a relapse of his old rheumatic disease, and his bones and joints were very painful. He asked for leave to recuperate at home. However, since all the official documents of the municipal government were waiting for the mayor to personally review them, Wu went to the municipal government yesterday morning to work diligently despite his illness, and immediately summoned Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and other important officials to inquire about important official matters. He also participated in the establishment meeting of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Minister Kong and Others Went to Beijing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

<h3 id="e118">Zhang Qun Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last, Talking Freely About the Political Situation in Hubei Province: He Will Stay for Three or Four Days and Then Return to Hubei <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, went to Beijing a few days ago to report on the political situation in Hubei Province to the Central Government. He completed his official duties and left Beijing to Shanghai the night before last. Mayor Wu, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Finance Bureau Cai Zengji, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun, and Municipal Secretary Guo Shen visited him one after another from 2:30 pm yesterday, and left after talking until about 5:30 pm. According to Zhang, his visit to Beijing was to report on the political situation in Hubei Province to the Central Government, and to inquire about the recent situation in North China. There were no other tasks. The rumors outside about his whereabouts are not accurate. Hubei Province is quite peaceful at present, and the general situation is much better than in the past. However, it has also been affected by the economic panic recently, and the market is extremely depressed. The Southwest wholeheartedly supports the Central Government, and the rumors are not credible. Looking at the recent visits to the north by important figures in the Southwest, such as Ye Qi, we can know this. President Wang had a high fever the day before yesterday (29th) and did not get out of bed yesterday (30th). He came to Shanghai for medical treatment that night. According to the doctor, a few stones were found in President Wang's gallbladder and need to be removed. However, President Wang is busy with political affairs and may not have time for surgery at present. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three or four days and will return to Hubei to take care of affairs.</p>

Chen plans to stay in Shanghai for a short time to take care of private affairs and will return to Fujian on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Key Points of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty: Overseas Chinese Can Freely Enter and Exit Vietnam, and the Head Tax on Overseas Chinese is Reduced by Half <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reported that after the expiration of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty, the Vietnamese authorities wantonly destroyed the commercial activities of overseas Chinese and the import of Chinese goods because there was no treaty relationship. Our country believed that the Vietnamese side did not adhere to the spirit of reciprocity for the import of French goods, so it could not be given the same treatment as in the past. Therefore, both sides have suffered adverse effects in commerce. Recently, the French side, through the French ambassador to China and our central diplomatic authorities, proceeded to renew the commercial treaty, and the issue of renewing the Vietnam commercial treaty, which had been in progress for several years and had not been resolved, was resolved. Many of our overseas Chinese are engaged in business in Vietnam, and the commercial transactions are also very frequent. The conclusion of this commercial treaty is quite convenient for the people of both sides. The most important points are recorded below: Our country will levy an import tax on Vietnamese rice, stipulating that each 100 kilograms will be subject to a customs duty of 1.5 yuan, which is a reduction of half a corner compared to the current tax rate. Vietnamese coal imports are stipulated to be subject to a tax of 9 mills and a half per ton, while the current tax regulations levy 2.8 yuan. As for the import tax on Chinese goods levied by Vietnam, it will generally be levied according to the tax rate set in 1910. Goods passing through Vietnam from Yunnan will be subject to a transit tax of 25%, which is now reduced to 1%. In addition, the head tax on overseas Chinese levied by the Annam government will also be reduced by half according to the current amount. The establishment of additional consulates has also been resolved. When the commercial treaty is implemented, our country will set up consulates in Saigon, Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places, and Chinese can also enter the country freely.</p>
<h3 id="e121">President Wang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning for Medical Treatment: Noël Advocates a Longer Period of Recuperation; The Affairs of the Executive Yuan Will Be Presided Over by Vice President Kong in Beijing <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, had a sharp increase in body temperature from June 28th. He immediately telegraphed Dr. Noël to Beijing for a diagnosis and found that there were bacteria and inflammation in the gallbladder. It was inconvenient to diagnose and treat in Beijing, so he followed the doctor's advice and left Beijing for Shanghai by night train at 11 pm the night before last, accompanied by Dr. Noël and Tieci Zeng Zhongming. He arrived at 7:10 am yesterday and immediately changed to a car and went straight to Dr. Noël's office on Xiafei Road for treatment. It is heard that although President Wang currently has bacteria and inflammation in his gallbladder, and the bile cannot flow smoothly, it will not become a gallbladder abscess due to prompt treatment. However, according to Dr. Noël's opinion, President Wang must undergo strict recuperation for a longer period of time, otherwise it will be quite dangerous. Therefore, President Wang decided to stay in the hospital for treatment. It is not certain when he will return to Beijing. The affairs of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily handled by Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. Kong left by night train at 11 pm yesterday to Beijing to preside over everything.</p>

As for the local postal savings and remittance bureaus, they will also be renamed sub-bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Sugar Committee Actively Working to Ban Private Sugar and Impose Heavy Taxes for Revenue and Hygiene; Rumors of Monopoly are Absolutely False <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Ministry of Finance recently approved fourteen articles of the "Outline for the Management of Sugar Transportation and Sales," the full text of which has been published in various newspapers. However, some Chinese and foreign sugar merchants in Shanghai still seem unclear about the establishment of the Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee by the Ministry of Finance. There has been much speculation, with some saying it is a practice of monopoly, or a preliminary step towards monopoly. There are also doubts about the soon-to-be-established China Sugar Company. Among the 64 members of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, 38 have jointly published a statement declaring that they have not joined the company. It is also heard that foreign sugar merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude, and opinions vary. In order to understand the content, the reporter of the Shenshi News Agency specifically visited the committee yesterday. According to Mr. Chen, the section chief of the committee, the purpose of establishing the Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee by the Ministry of Finance is to eliminate private sugar, promote domestic production, safeguard tax revenue, replenish the national treasury, and regulate sugar prices, in order to eliminate merchant speculation. The investigation of the production and sales of sugar is to prevent tax evasion, balance market prices, and ensure that sugar is not adulterated with other sugar substances, in order to prioritize public health. The reporter further asked about the rumored intention of the government to monopolize sugar by establishing a sugar company. Mr. Chen stated that there was absolutely no such intention. Sugar monopoly has no legal basis, which is well known. Moreover, according to Article 6 of the Outline, the sugar company should purchase sugar at the lowest possible market price, and Article 7 stipulates that the sugar company shall not arbitrarily raise prices to seek speculative profits when promoting sales, so as to avoid the abuses of monopoly. Therefore, all sugar merchants can trade freely with the sugar company, without any conflict. Legitimate merchants will not only not be affected by the establishment of the sugar company, but will also indirectly benefit from it, because adulterated sugar containing saccharin and other powdered substances, as well as tax-evading private sugar, must be prohibited from sale, which will inevitably increase the business of legitimate merchants. On the part of the sugar company, there are clear provisions in the Outline and it is governed by economic principles, so there will be no bias in transportation and sales. Moreover, the sugar company will set up sales offices and distribution points, and each place that sells sugar will enjoy commissions. The more sales, the more commissions, so everyone will be happy to refuse to sell private sugar. If there is smuggling, the officials can be notified to carry out crackdowns. In this way, there will be benefits to government tax revenue. As for foreign sugar merchants, if they are unwilling to violate China's tax laws and seek the development of their business through legitimate channels, they will be welcomed to cooperate with the China Sugar Company. In short, the establishment of the Sugar Management Committee by the Ministry of Finance is actually in a guiding and assisting position for the legitimate business of Chinese and foreign sugar merchants, with only benefits and no harm. Currently, the work of the committee is actively underway. Mr. Chen said that the China Sugar Company is a commercial organization, and if it does not violate the current laws and regulations of the country, the government cannot interfere with its scheduled establishment.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance Borrows 300,000 Yuan in Shanghai; Two Banks Have Already Delivered the Funds <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the World News Agency, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance recently borrowed 300,000 yuan from the Agricultural Bank of China and the Central Bank to repay the principal and interest of public bonds. According to banking circles, the loan was undertaken by the Agricultural Bank of China for 200,000 yuan, secured by the tax revenue from foil production in Zhejiang Province, and by the Central Bank for 100,000 yuan, secured by the salt surtax revenue, at a monthly interest rate of 1%. Because Zhejiang Province needs to repay the principal and interest of three types of public bonds, including disaster relief, old debt clearance, and highway construction, by the end of June, in addition to the more than 300,000 yuan held by the Public Debt Fund Management Committee, there is still a shortfall of about 300,000 yuan, so the loan was taken from the two banks to cover the payment. The agreement was signed and delivered on the 30th of last month, and transferred to the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China and the Zhejiang Local Bank for disbursement of the principal and interest of the public bonds.</p>

Now, the three engines of the aircraft have been installed and will fly back to Chongqing on the 2nd. The official flight from Chongqing to Kunming is scheduled to start on July 5th, and will then fly according to the original schedule.</p>

<p>Recently, the weather has been continuously阴雨, and the water levels of the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have risen sharply, causing increasing obstacles for steamboats. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from various ports along the Yangtze River, stating that the water level of the Han River had exceeded 43 feet above the water mark, and the river water along the banks had already submerged the embankment feet, and low-lying areas had reached the embankment. The Wuhan Flood Control Association is carrying out protection work at various points along the embankment. Various shipping companies are also preparing flood prevention work at various wharves and warehouses. Telegrams from Jiujiang and Wuhu both stated that the river water had already flooded the low-lying land of various wharves along the river yesterday, with the water level equal to the shore. If it rises further, the city will also be submerged, and railway bridges will be damaged. All steamboats going up and down the river have been ordered to limit their speed to prevent damage to the embankments.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Shanghai Assets of the Eastern Railway Were Received by the Japanese Side Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Entrusted to the International Transportation Company</p>
<p>But the company has not yet officially acknowledged it</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally stated that it does not recognize the illegal sale and purchase of the China Eastern Railway, which is jointly owned by China and Russia, by Japan and Russia as a fait accompli. It is now known that after the sale of the railway by both parties, it has been entrusted by Japan to the South Manchuria Railway Company for management. At that time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the assets of the China Eastern Railway in Shanghai (referring to the China Eastern Railway Business Office and the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong) were also included in the sales contract. However, for several days, the receipt of these assets has not been implemented. The Soviet Russian representative is still managing it in Shanghai. It was not until last week that the Japanese and Russian sides secretly began the process of receiving the above two institutions. The Japanese side was entrusted by the Shanghai Office of the South Manchuria Railway Company to the Japan International Transportation Company for handling. It was heard yesterday that the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong has already been completely received and started operating yesterday. The China Eastern Railway Business Office at 33 Sichuan Road was also received yesterday and is currently being reorganized. It is expected to start operating today or tomorrow. The reporter met with Mr. Nakano, the general manager of the International Transportation Company, who did not admit to receiving the assets of the China Eastern Railway, saying that it was because the company's original building was too dark, so it moved to 33 Sichuan Road to work. However, other Japanese people in the company all admitted that they had just received it from the Eastern Railway Business Office and were scheduled to start operating today. At the same time, the reporter went to 68 Guangdong Road to investigate the International Transportation Company, but did not see the company preparing to move. The Chinese Enterprise Bank (the landlord of the China Eastern Railway Business Office) also did not see the China Eastern Railway Business Office退租退租 and the International Transportation Company转租转租. All parties have proved that the International Transportation Company has already represented the South Manchuria Railway Company authorities in taking over the Shanghai assets of the China Eastern Railway. It is not yet certain what name will be used to operate the above two institutions in the future. It is generally operated under the name of the International Transportation Company. In addition, the reporter also inquired about this news with the Qingli Office of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank, which has a great interest in the issue and once submitted a request to the local court to execute the attachment of the above assets. According to Mr. Yevadensky, the Russian consultant of the bank, they still did not know about it, even if they knew it, they could not do anything about it. As for the lawsuit at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, this is about the entire debt issue between the China Eastern Railway and Daosheng Bank, not just this part of the assets. They will contact the Daosheng Bank Qingli Office in Paris and London to jointly proceed.</p>

<p>The detailed measures for the profit sharing of the six companies operating on the Yangtze River have been detailed in the newspaper on the 30th.

Therefore, the representatives of the six companies convened another meeting and decided to postpone it for two days, and to implement the profit sharing from tomorrow (July 3rd). The first step is to invite ship surveyors to estimate the tonnage of the 65 Yangtze River steamboats and 88 iron barges reported by the six companies, so as to calculate the shipping capacity, and then calculate the profit sharing points according to the proportion. The work of handling these profit sharing procedures has been extremely busy in recent days.</p>

<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee held its executive committee meeting in Xi'an in May, as previously reported. The Committee's General Secretary, Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, proposed that the Committee's various disaster prevention efforts require funding, and hoped to introduce the Committee's work to society, while hoping that members of society, based on their understanding of the Committee's work, would do their best to donate and maintain the aforementioned projects. It was resolved that, in addition to the original agricultural engineering and other divisions, a fundraising division would be added, which would engage in a national fundraising campaign, inviting provincial branches to participate and manage their branches in accordance with the model branch regulations, considering this fundraising work as part of the annual affairs of each branch and working together. The general public in the country recognizes that the Committee's approach to disaster prevention and relief through construction methods is appropriate and will certainly support it in the future. It is reported that the Committee's Shanghai office formed the Shanghai Voluntary Committee last year, publicly electing Mr. Zhu Boquan of the Shanghai Banking Association as Chairman. Under Mr. Zhu's leadership, a fundraising campaign was held in Shanghai, with over 18,000 participants from September of last year to June of this year, donating over 25,000 yuan, demonstrating the enthusiastic support of the people of Shanghai. Now, Mr. Zhu is unable to continue due to busy work, and strongly resigned. The Committee tried to retain him without success, and held a voluntary committee meeting on the 28th of last month, publicly electing Mr. Chen Zheqing, General Manager of the Yanyeh (Salt Industry) Bank, as Chairman. He has accepted the invitation. Mr. Baker and Mr. Liu Yuwan will remain as Vice Chairmen, and Mr. Xu Xinliu as Honorary Treasurer. Mr. Chen has always been enthusiastic about public welfare, and is highly respected. It is believed that under his guidance, the Committee's fundraising campaign will achieve excellent results.</p>

<h3 id="e143">North Shanghai Station Implements New Ticketing System for Rickshaws <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Starting today, a new system will be implemented at the North Shanghai Station where passengers purchase tickets for rickshaws entering the station to pick up passengers. This measure sweeps away the long-standing problem of rickshaw pullers privately extorting passengers, which passengers generally praise as convenient. The details are explored below. The measures implemented at the station this time are the result of a year of research and rectification of rickshaws entering the station by the two-route transportation department. The measures have been contracted to the Samsung Rickshaw Company. The rickshaw fare is marked on a Shanghai map, with the North Shanghai Station as the center, divided into red and blue circles. For each circle beyond the red line, the fare increases by one dime; for each circle beyond the blue line, the fare increases by two cents, all calculated in silver dollars. The table is printed at the rickshaw ticket window on the east corridor of the North Shanghai Station, which is very easy for passengers to check. The set fare is roughly equal to the ordinary fare, and it is consistent regardless of weather, including the cost for the rickshaw puller to carry the passenger's luggage to the door of the destination, and the rickshaw puller is not allowed to demand any extra money. Before boarding, passengers can purchase tickets in advance at the price. The ticket is in two parts, one part is torn off and given to the rickshaw puller upon arrival, and the other part is kept by the passenger for inquiries about illegal behavior by the rickshaw puller with the railway authorities. The rickshaw pullers all wear uniforms custom-made by the railway authorities for easy identification. It is reported that in order to take care of the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers who originally had licenses to operate at the station, the railway authorities still allow these rickshaw pullers to obtain free licenses to drop off passengers, but they must sign a guarantee with the contractor, Samsung Rickshaw Company, and comply with the regulations and uniform fares stipulated by the railway authorities.</p>

<p>Raven had not yet submitted the surety bond yesterday afternoon, reports the North-China Daily News. Mr. He Fu, Liquidator of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Court for China last Saturday (June 29), ordering Raven, former General Manager of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, American Eastern Banking Company, Pui Yee Land Company, and Pui Yee Bank, to immediately return silver 135,000 taels. Mr. He Fu told people yesterday (Sunday) that his lawsuit against Raven was intended to recover this 135,000 taels for the creditors. Mr. He Fu also applied to the U.S. Court before midnight on Saturday to issue an order preventing Raven from leaving China, as it was heard that Raven was trying to hastily leave the Republic of China and escape the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court. Chief Judge Helmick of the U.S. Court approved the application and ordered Raven to post a bond of US$20,000.</p>
<p>It was learned from U.S. Court bailiff Fuber at 6 p.m. on Sunday that Raven had not yet deposited the bond with the court. However, Mr. Fu claimed that since today was Sunday, it would naturally be difficult for Raven to raise the required bond. He decided to give Raven the opportunity to deposit it on Monday, so he did not take immediate severe action. Deputy bailiff Peterson will be residing at Raven's residence at 555 Hongqiao Road tonight. It is noted that on January 13, 1932, the board of directors of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation passed the following resolution:</p>
<p>"Because Raven, General Manager, Manager and Initiator of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, has served for a long time, and has been loyal and sincere, and has never taken a salary or other compensation, it is resolved to grant him an honorarium of 135,000 taels to reward his loyal service, and it is resolved to order the treasurer to pay Raven all of this amount, and to write off this amount from the company's books within six years or less. In 1932, 35,000 taels should be written off, and the remaining amount should be written off in any year depending on the amount of net profit earned by the company during this period."</p>
<p>According to Mr. He Fu's interview with a newspaper reporter, judging from the wording of the resolution, the contents of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation at that time were already empty. We must pay attention to the fact that 135,000 taels were immediately paid to Raven, and that the amount was written off from the bank's books in six years, and that the bank did not owe Raven a single cent at that time. All of this is sufficient to prove that the contents of the bank were already empty at that time, and he believes that Raven must have known this situation well. Mr. He Fu also said that when the board of directors of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation passed a resolution to grant Raven 135,000 taels in cash, the American Eastern Banking Company and the Pui Yee Land Company also paid Raven the same amount of gratuity. In the near future, the American Eastern Banking Company and the Pui Yee Land Company will also sue Raven for this reason. One more thing to note is that the American-Oriental Banking Corporation was originally registered in Connecticut, USA, as a trading company with the same name. When it opened in Shanghai, it operated as a banking business. Mr. He Fu also said that the Pui</p>

For a time, the roadsides in the Chinese and French Concessions were unable to drain the accumulated water, turning into rivers. Although the rain decreased after 2 a.m., there were still showers until noon, and the rain did not stop until about 1 p.m. The situations in various places are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhabei Area: The roadsides in areas such as Han Bridge, Qujiang Road, Yongxing Road, Yuyingtang Road, and Zhongxing Road were all filled with water in low-lying areas, turning into ditches. The entrances of the shops were all crossed by jumping over boards. The low-lying fields before and after the Xijin Public Office, as well as behind the Quanwan Guild Hall on Gonghe New Road, near the Lu Family Residence on Huta Road, behind the Jiaguo Guild Hall on Taiyang Temple Road, and the open space west of Datong Road south of the Taiyang Temple Railway, were all a vast expanse of water when viewed from a distance due to the lower terrain. The cobblestone roads in various places, such as Zhongxing Road, Gonghe New Road, and Yongxing Road, were all thoroughly cleaned.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Nanshi</p>
<p>The low-lying areas of Guohuo Road and Difang Ting in Nanshi were all filled with water, several inches deep. By the afternoon, when the rain stopped and the sun came out, the accumulated water in various places gradually receded.</p>
<p>Flight Delay</p>
<p>According to the China National Aviation Corporation, the Shanghai-Hankou West flight was delayed by ten minutes, and the eastbound flight arrived in Shanghai at 2:40 p.m., delayed by forty minutes.</p>
<p>This Year's Rainfall</p>
<p>From January 1 to June 30 this year, the rainfall near the city reached 724 millimeters (28.05 inches), which is 313.2 millimeters more than the 400.8 millimeters (15.78 inches) in the same period last year, reaching nearly two-thirds more. Moreover, from midnight last night to 9 a.m. this morning, another 56.9 millimeters (2.24 inches) of rain was received.</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the positions of the upper and lower rice, wheat, and flour Yiyin companies were unimaginable, and it was feared that they would not be able to pay a single cent. As for the American Eastern Banking Company, although a certain amount of money was involved, it is difficult to say whether this amount belongs to it. It is now doing its best to protect the interests of creditors and depositors. Auditor Fulte, under his guidance, is working tirelessly day and night, which is commendable. However, there is still much work to be done. What he has applied to the U.S. Court is to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff the current amount of 188,881.18 yuan, which is equivalent to 135,000 taels in silver, plus the total amount of 6% interest from January 13, 1932 to the date of repayment. The case must eventually be tried, but Chief Judge Helmick, after ordering the defendant to submit a bond on Saturday, went to Beijing on Sunday afternoon to handle the case, and must also go to Tianjin, so it will take about two weeks before he can return to Shanghai to handle this case.</p>
<p>Mr. Raven met with a newspaper reporter at his residence at 555 Hongqiao Road yesterday (Sunday) afternoon and answered questions about the affairs of Pui Yee Bank, American Eastern Banking Company, and American-Oriental Banking Corporation for half an hour. Mr. Raven said that he was surprised that the U.S. Court had issued an order prohibiting him from leaving Shanghai, as he had no intention of leaving Shanghai. The required bond can be prepared today (Monday). However, Raven did not want to reveal the name of the guarantor. When the reporter asked about the 135,000 taels in cash attached to the American-Oriental Banking Corporation in January 1932, Mr. Raven replied that the amount had been properly resolved by the board of directors, and he had consulted with lawyers before accepting it. He firmly believed that the contents of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation at that time and later were substantial. As for the matter of writing off this amount in the books of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation in six years, this was only a matter of bookkeeping, and he felt that there was nothing strange about it. He was not an accountant, and the manager of the bank was a good accountant, and the bank hired a well-known auditor to audit the books. When the American-Oriental Banking Corporation closed its doors, he hoped and believed that the amounts owed to the various accounts could be repaid in full. He still hopes this, but it may take several years. The bank, like many banks in Shanghai, had a large amount of bad debts. However, other banks could transfer funds from their overseas headquarters, while the American-Oriental Banking Corporation's headquarters was located in Shanghai and could not have this convenience. If business improves, the clearing of these bad debts can be accelerated; otherwise, it will take longer. The Pui Yee Bank holds shares in the American Eastern Banking Company, and the American Eastern Banking Company holds shares in the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, so the positions of the first two companies depend on the American-Oriental Banking Corporation. When the reporter asked whether he himself owed money to the Pui Yee Bank, Raven replied that not only did he not owe money, but he also did his best to transfer funds to help it, because the company had more difficulty in turnover than the other two companies, and everything depended on the other two companies.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post, Mr. Raven had not yet found the US$20,000 surety bond or cash required by the U.S. Court by noon today (Monday). This morning, Mr. Raven visited U.S. Court bailiff Fuber to discuss everything. Since Saturday night, Raven's actions have been monitored by representatives of the U.S. Court bailiff. If he still cannot find a guarantor or cash by a certain time this afternoon, he will have to spend the night in the Xiamen Road West Prison.</p>
<p>Transactions were all made on the basis of domestic and foreign floods causing disasters and crop losses, so they rebounded by a dime or so from the previous day. The top grade Tejing (special grade glutinous rice) was 12.8 yuan, the second grade was 12 yuan, and the Tongche (general grade) rebounded by a dime or so. Foreign rice saw a rise of five cents. Wheat opened at 3.54 yuan in the morning, also up a dime. Flour was 2.4 yuan, up more than four cents. Due to the sharp rise in foreign markets, everyone is optimistic. The local gang in this street sees a promising future and is busy with preparations. According to general observations, if the weather continues to be muggy and rainy, then the future market for rice and wheat will have to be looked at higher. As for cotton yarn, yesterday happened to be a holiday, so there was no market. It is expected that the market will also rise when it opens today.</p>
<p>Postponement of Wall Cleaning</p>
<p>In view of the fact that wall advertisements in the city are very messy, the Municipal Health Bureau, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, launched a city-wide wall cleaning campaign. All preparations have been completed. It was originally planned to divide the city into seven districts, and the Health Bureau would send personnel to cooperate with the New Life Guidance Team of the Public Security Bureau to start cleaning. According to the Health Bureau, due to the heavy rain yesterday, which was not conducive to work, it was decided to postpone the event. The date will be decided after consultation with the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Second Shanghai North National Products Exhibition Opened Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Market Will Open Today</p>
<p>The Second Shanghai North National Products Exhibition, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, opened yesterday and the market will open today. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Organizers of the Conference</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at the Zhabei Charitable Organization at 2 p.m. yesterday. More than 70 people attended, including Wang Binyan, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xiaochu, Cai Qiajun, Sun Xinzhu, Liu Zhongying, Ge Futian, and Xu Chengde. Wang Binyan, Lin Kanghou, Cai Qiajun, Sun Xinzhu, and Xu Xiaochu served as the presidium, Liu Zhongying served as the general host, Ge Futian served as the master of ceremonies, and Xu Chengde served as the recorder.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Cai Qiajun first reported that this year is the Student National Products Year. The China National Products Manufacturers Association launched the Second National Products Exhibition to implement the purpose of promoting national products so that citizens can have a consistent psychology of loving domestic goods. Nowadays, the way to save our country is to promote domestic goods and resist the dumping of foreign goods. If we only promote domestic goods and do not block the leakage of foreign goods, then its results can be imagined. Since the January 28th Incident, Zhabei's industry and commerce have been declining and have not yet recovered, so we must promote national products to revitalize industry and save the current crisis. I hope that all sectors will assist more to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Speech and Flag Raising</p>
<p>Then Liu Zhongying gave a speech. It has been three years since our country promoted national products, and its effect is almost zero. The annual leakage is more than hundreds of millions. The reason for this is that the promoters cannot practice what they preach, and can only sing high tunes and shout slogans at the meeting, while the general public in our country mostly respects foreign goods, resulting in this contradictory state. This year is the Student National Products Year. A small number of students have been able to nationalize domestic goods. The Manufacturers Association is afraid that this National Products Year will still become a past phenomenon, so it launched the Second National Products Exhibition. I hope that the people of Shanghai North can understand this purpose. Then Liu Zhongying raised the flag.</p>
<p>Market Open</p>
<p>The temporary market attached to the conference, participated in by domestic product manufacturers, was originally scheduled to open simultaneously yesterday afternoon, but due to continuous muggy rain, construction was not completed, resulting in a postponement to today. The association yesterday issued a notice to the factories, approving opening every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. All participating manufacturers should use the invoices printed by the association, and the staff should wear the association membership card to show uniformity and facilitate identification. The association sells these invoices and badges at face value. The goods sold by each factory are completely based on national products as the standard. If non-national products are found, they will be severely punished according to the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e151">City Government Approves Opening of Yimiao and Second Gardens <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Dianchun Hall's Opening Postponed</p>
<p>The Municipal Government considers the city's Yimiao (City God Temple) a must-see for Chinese and foreign visitors. However, the Dianchun Hall, Cuixiu Hall, and the inner garden, which embody the spirit of traditional Chinese architecture, have remained closed due to the involvement of various trade associations, which is regrettable. The Municipal Government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and Public Safety Bureau to liaise with these associations to expedite the opening of these areas to the public. After a meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau with representatives from the Public Works, Finance, Public Safety, Land, Education, Public Utilities, and Health Bureaus, as well as the Bean &amp; Rice, Sugar, and Banking Trade Associations, a temporary plan was agreed upon. This plan follows the model of the Confucius Temple Park and the Public Education Center, with the gardens open six days a week. Mondays are reserved for association meetings or maintenance. However, due to the complete use of Dianchun Hall's buildings as the Sugar Industry Elementary School and the small size of the garden, its opening is temporarily postponed. The above plan has been approved by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Ministry of Industry Revises Commodity Inspection Fees <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Effective Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has revised the commodity inspection fee schedule. The new schedule, which reportedly involves slightly lower fees than before for most items, went into effect yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Rubber Industry Petitions Finance Ministry to Limit Factory Output; Drafts Temporary Production Control Plan, Explains Reasons and Requests Announcement for Implementation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Rubber Products Trade Association has petitioned the Ministry of Industry, stating that overproduction within the industry threatens its collapse. They have drafted a temporary plan to regulate supply and demand and request its approval and implementation to provide relief. The rubber products industry is a new one designed to resist foreign imports. Normally, it should be thriving, not facing imminent danger. However, the current reality is that the entire industry is struggling. This is due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the depression in the market. The unlimited establishment of factories and unlimited production are fatal flaws. Excessive production impedes economic progress, leading to a myriad of problems: price wars, corner-cutting, and shoddy manufacturing. The impact of this is not only the depletion of capital and the deterioration of goods and credit, but the very foundation of production is being undermined and ultimately destroyed. Therefore, to address the root cause and achieve a quick remedy, production control is necessary to prevent oversupply. This is an immediate, yet essential solution. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Rubber Industry Trade Association has already drafted and implemented a production control method approved by the Guangdong Provincial Government. Article 9 of the association's regulations also contains explicit limitations. Although the specific limitations may differ, the underlying intention is the same. Over the years, overproduction in the industry has unfortunately become a universal problem, requiring an overall rescue plan. Shanghai, with its size and number of businesses, far exceeds Guangzhou. However, there is currently no solution in sight, a situation that is deeply concerning. The association observes that members, scattered like loose sand, are acutely aware of the failures of competition and have seen the positive effects of production limitations in Guangzhou. They have now recognized the need to change course. They have drawn from the Guangzhou Municipal Temporary Measures for Limiting Rubber Shoe Factory Output, as well as Article 9 of the association regulations, and adapted them to Shanghai's circumstances, drafting a plan to control production. This plan has been unanimously approved by the association's representatives at a general meeting. Therefore, they respectfully submit this document to the Ministry, requesting that it be reviewed and approved, and that an official announcement be made and personnel dispatched to oversee its implementation. This will provide relief and the association will be eternally grateful. Submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, including one copy of the Shanghai National Goods Rubber Products Industry Temporary Production Control Plan and one copy of the Guangzhou Municipal Temporary Measures for Limiting Rubber Shoe Factory Output.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Yongqing Li Disaster Victims' Families Association; Public Burial of Burned Bodies; Election of Officers to Negotiate with Da Zhonghua; City Federation's Four District Branches Discuss Assistance <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Following the fire at the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory, families of the victims of the Yongqing Li disaster held a meeting at 320 Yongqing Li on the afternoon of the previous day at 8:00 PM, attended by over 60 people. Yan Bingzhou presided over the meeting, reporting on the disaster situation. They then discussed and passed the following resolutions: (1) To organize a Da Zhonghua Disaster Victims' Families Support Association, with a registration office at 320 Yongqing Li. (2) To elect Yan Bingzhou as Chairman, Qin Bukun, Liu Jinbiao, and Ni Zirong as Standing Committee Members, Wu Shaowen as Economic Custodian, Yu Tianqu as Accountant, Yan Shaoping as Secretary, and Ying Jiyun, Wu Jin, Yu Shengping, Ying Yuliang, and Ni Yunwu as Supervisors and Negotiating Committee Members. (3) Regarding the public burial of the disaster victims and relief for their families, it was decided that the association would request the Liyi Hall to purchase coffins and clothing for the deceased. The disaster victims' families would be responsible for repaying these costs, except for those in extreme poverty. A fundraising effort of one yuan per household (91 households before the disaster, now 70) would be launched among the non-affected residents of the Li to provide initial relief. (4) To take photographs of the disaster victims' bodies and the tragic situation in the Li. (5) All families of the disaster victims should wait for the coroner's examination of the bodies before hiring vehicles to transport them back to the Li for mourning. (6) Regarding how to address the tragedy, it was decided to hire a lawyer to handle the matter legally. The facts of the incident would be submitted to various organizations and groups to seek justice and request assistance and relief. On the morning of the previous day, over 50 relatives of the deceased hired three trucks to go to the coroner's office on Avenue Petain to collect the bodies in preparation for negotiations with the Da Zhonghua factory. However, the police had received prior notice and, fearing trouble, deployed officers to maintain order. The families insisted on carrying the coffins into the factory, leading to verbal clashes with the police. Eventually, all 16 coffins remained temporarily housed on wasteland next to the Da Zhonghua factory. In the afternoon, the families held an emergency meeting and decided: (1) To send a letter to the Jianghuai Fellow-Villagers Association to convene an emergency meeting to lodge a strong protest and negotiate with the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory. (2) Representatives would be dispatched that evening to survey the families, and lawyers would formally file a lawsuit against the Da Zhonghua factory in the First Special Court today, seeking compensation and pensions.</p>
<h3 id="e155">"Please Don't Report to the Police" Robbers Said While Fleeing With Loot; Ningxing Street Tobacco and Paper Store Robbed <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Sande Tobacco and Paper Store at No. 66 Ningxing Street (i.e. Caishi Street), east of Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, is owned by Qian Anren, a Chongming native. It has been in business for over a decade, selling cigarettes, general merchandise, and exchanging silver dollars. Business used to be good, but has declined in recent years. At 8:15 PM on the night before last (30th), during a heavy downpour, an apprentice waded through the water and opened the iron gate. Suddenly, three robbers appeared, all about 20-30 years old. One, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, stood guard outside. The other two, wearing striped poplin white short shirts and pants, both spoke with a northern accent. They entered the store, placed a pistol on the counter, and ordered the owner, Qian Anren, and others to remain silent. They rushed into the store and grabbed one five-yuan banknote, over ten one-yuan banknotes, silver dollars, silver dimes, and 29 copper coins, totaling about 30 yuan, from the counter. They then told the owner, "Please help us out, boss, and don't report to the police." With that, they took the pistol, exited the store, and fled with the lookout. Afterwards, the owner reported the robbery to the Grand Bell Police Station. The head officer immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the scene and await apprehension of the robbers.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Check Bounce Reveals Debt of 15,000 Yuan; Son-in-Law Reluctant to Sue Father-in-Law; Brother Reports to Police <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Chuan Shaowen, a Ningbo native residing at No. 15, Lane 507, Avenue Mett Herst, is a commission agent for foreign goods and runs Qingfeng Foreign Goods Company. His son-in-law, Li Zhengchu, operates Yuanfengchang Silk and Satin Foreign Cloth Shop at No. 95 McGonigle Road. As both are in the same business and relatives, they frequently interact. Chuan often discounted post-dated checks with his son-in-law Li for cash. Over the months, Chuan's matured checks could not be fully cashed. By April of this year, Chuan owed Li a total of 9,400 yuan in bounced checks. On April 28th, Chuan asked Li to discount three Nanjing Hui checks for 15,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan each, claiming they were not yet due and that he needed the cash for other purposes. He offered three Changfeng Bank checks as collateral. Li, trusting his father-in-law, gave Chuan 5,600 yuan, adding it to the previous debt of 9,400 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the maturity date approached, Li prepared to cash the Changfeng Bank checks, but Chuan, knowing that the three checks for 15,000 yuan were worthless and that there were no funds in the account, asked Li for an extension. However, to this day, nothing has been resolved. Li's brother, Li Yuanchu, reported the matter to the Gordon Road Police Station, requesting the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. Yesterday, Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei and Detective Zhang Liang went and arrested Chuan Shaowen, detaining him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Goujiu charged him with fraud under Article 339 of the New Criminal Code and issuing bad checks under Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. He presented the case and the three checks. Li Yuanchu also filed a complaint regarding the previous circumstances. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the defendant, Chuan Shaowen, he ordered him to be detained for further questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Suspicious Claim of Withdrawal of Attached Shares; Wu's Equity and Payment Date More Than Three Months Apart; Yao Yaoming Sues Wu Jincheng Criminally <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yao Yaoming, manager of Chengji Lumber Company at No. 220 Connaught Road, deposited 40,521.48 yuan into the Yikang Fengji Bank on Ningbo Road on January 30th of this year. The bank issued a cashier's check for 36,790.29 yuan. Unexpectedly, on January 31st, the bank suddenly went bankrupt, and the cashier's check could not be cashed. Yao hired lawyer Osen to sue the bank's owner, Wu Jincheng, in the First Special Court for payment. During the lawsuit, Yao discovered that Wu had a large amount of shares in the Rende Bank at No. 3, Lane 138, Tianjin Road. To protect his claim, he requested the court to provisionally attach Wu's shares in Rende. The court approved the provisional attachment. When the ruling was delivered, Rende Bank suddenly claimed that Wu's shares had been withdrawn in February. However, Yao learned that Wu still had significant shares in April. The claim that the shares were withdrawn in February was intended to avoid execution by creditors, which is a violation of Articles 383 and 384 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, Yao hired lawyer Osen to file a criminal lawsuit against Wu. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court summoned witnesses. The address for Wu Jincheng was listed as No. 377 Jiaozhou Road, but when the bailiff went to serve the summons, that address was the Qingnian Sports Association, and there was no one named Wu Jincheng. Therefore, he could not be summoned. First, Chen Zengrui, manager of Rende Bank, was summoned to testify about whether Wu had shares in Rende Bank. Chen stated that he had 24,000 yuan worth of shares, but that the shares had been withdrawn on February 3rd of this year, and presented the payment book as evidence. Judge Huang examined the book and saw that the date of payment to Wu for 24,000 yuan was May 16th. He asked why the payment date was May 16th if the shares were withdrawn on February 3rd. Chen's answer was vague. Lawyer Osen stated that, according to the plaintiff, Wu's shares were actually worth over 60,000 yuan, but they only claimed 24,000 yuan. The payment date was more than three months after the withdrawal date, and there were several subsequent payments to Wu in the book after May 16th. The book was full of irregularities and should be temporarily held for examination. Chen Guoliang was the lawyer receiving summonses for Wu Jincheng's civil case, so summonses for this case should be sent to Chen for forwarding. Judge Huang approved this and stated that further investigation was needed, so the case would be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Thieves Prepare to Divide Loot; Terrified by Police Arrival; Surrender Immediately; Confirmed to Have Committed Numerous Crimes <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Li Wancang, a Ningbo native and accountant at the Dazhong Silver Company, 55 years old, living at No. 29 Gu Yuan Road in the French Concession, was robbed by four armed men at about 10 PM the night before last. They barged in, ransacked the place, and stole clothing and jewelry worth over 200 yuan. As the thieves fled with the loot, they scattered in all directions. One of them, Shi Ajin, a 30-year-old Ningbo native, was walking near the intersection of Avenue Albert and Rue Paul Beau when he was spotted by Inspector Jiang Futian, Detective Li Liansheng, and Chinese and foreign detectives Ni Xiafei, Lu Luxian, Wang Baojin, etc. of the French Concession Police and Chinese officers from Precinct 102. They noticed Shi Ajin behaving suspiciously and arrested him. A loaded pistol and stolen items such as diamond rings were found on him. Shi confessed that he had just committed a robbery at Li's house at No. 29 Gu Yuan Road and revealed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 85, Lane 428, Dagu Road in the International Settlement. The detectives immediately took Shi to that address, accompanied by officers from the Chengdu Road Police Station, to make arrests. The other thieves had just gathered and were waiting for Shi to arrive and divide the loot. They were overjoyed, but suddenly saw the detectives arrive with Shi, and were all terrified. They surrendered immediately. Six people were arrested: Qian Yejin, Li Zhizhang, Xu Xianlin, Yuan Yougen, Chen Aquan, and Zhang Acai. Three more loaded pistols and stolen goods were also seized and taken back to the French Concession Police Station for questioning. The thieves confessed that the ringleaders were Ye Shiquan (nicknamed "Old Jiang") and his younger brother Ye Shixiang, who ran a firewood shop at a certain address on Route Cardinal Mercier. The detectives, based on this information, went to that address, but only found a few suspects; the Ye brothers had already fled. It was later discovered that the thieves had committed over 20 robberies in the concession. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian held a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the defendants had committed numerous crimes and requested an extension to investigate further before bringing charges. The arresting detectives reported on the arrest of the defendants and presented the pistols and bullets as evidence. After reviewing the evidence, the judge briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded for a further hearing on July 10th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Ma Chengkuan, a Yancheng native, has been working as a rickshaw puller near No. 185 Liyuan Road, Xiejiao. On the night before last (30th) at around 9 PM, during a heavy rainstorm, six robbers, all speaking with a local accent, suddenly appeared. Two stood guard outside, while four entered the house. One of them, wearing a yellow raincoat, claimed to be searching for drugs and rushed into the room, ransacking the place. They stole 70 yuan in paper money, twenty silver dimes, and four hundred copper coins before fleeing. The incident was reported to the local police station for investigation.</p>

<p>A young couple arrived at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road on the day before yesterday (29th). Arm in arm, they booked room 404 on the fourth floor. The register listed the man as Shen Zhongkang from Ningbo, age 30. The woman was simply listed as Ms. Shen, age 20, wearing a purplish-brown cheongsam. They stayed for two days without going out. On the previous night, they went out together briefly, returning around 11:00 PM. Before going to bed, they told the room service attendant that they needed to get up early at 10:00 AM the next morning and asked him to knock on the door to wake them up. The attendant agreed and left, closing the door tightly. The next morning, at 10:00 AM, the attendant knocked on the door, but there was no response. Becoming suspicious, he forced the door open and saw the couple lying in bed, staring blankly, barely breathing. Several empty bottles of tranquilizer pills were on the table, along with four suicide notes. The notes stated that they were not free to marry and would rather die. Realizing that they had likely taken poison, he rushed to tell the front desk, which then reported it to the Laoza Police Station. They were rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Due to the large overdose, their lives were in danger.</p>

<p>The Jiangwan District Public Health Sports Meet, which opened on June 28th, has attracted no less than tens of thousands of visitors each day, a grand spectacle never seen before. The distribution of Rendan pills by the Sino-French Pharmacy and Star Brand cologne by the Sino-Western Pharmacy, as well as fans distributed by various pharmacies, were very well received by the visitors. As for the entertainment programs, in addition to the performances by the Jiangxi, Qiujiang, and Zhongshan municipal schools, which all contained public health messages, there was also the national martial arts performance by the Weiwei Society, whose skills were superb, causing shouts of praise.

<p>The Yikang Fengji Bank on Ningbo Road, due to financial difficulties, declared liquidation on January 31st of this year.

The attached civil suit was dismissed.</p>

<p>The rascal Zhu Jinfang, recently bored and idle, had a wild idea and impersonated Zhu Xuefan, the chairman of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. He falsely claimed that his sister, Wanzhen, would be getting married on the first of this month, and asked a printing shop to print wedding invitations. Zhu and Xuefan's names were listed together, with the fake address of the Taihe Garden Restaurant on Second Avenue listed as the wedding hall. The residence was listed as No. 12 Shunxin Li, Laborie Road in the French Concession. He sent the invitations to Zhu Xuefan's relatives and friends, hoping to obtain wedding gifts. The French Concession Police discovered the plot and went to the rear building of No. 12 Shunxin Li, Caishi Road, Laborie Road on the previous day and arrested the suspects, Jin Jiakang (age 30) and his brother Jin Aja (age 33), and seized several wedding banners and congratulatory scrolls. However, Zhu had fled and was not apprehended. The sub-landlord stated that the Zhu tenants had only moved into the rear building a little over ten days ago and he did not know that they were marrying off a "sister." The detectives took the two Jins back to the police station and sent detectives to the Taihe Garden Restaurant to investigate. There was no Zhu family wedding event scheduled for yesterday (July 1st). The detective reported this to the police chief. Yesterday morning, the two defendants were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for questioning. Because the defendant was suspected of a crime, the new criminal code stipulates a sentence of more than three years, so the case was transferred to the First Criminal Division, where Judge Li Changnian held a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested for forgery, and the police court still needed to investigate the case and requested a postponement, and after investigation they would plead for a trial. The arresting detective presented the invitation, silk banners, gold lettering and other evidence. After reviewing the evidence, the court questioned the defendants, who all prevaricated. The judge ordered a further hearing on July 5th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>On May 27th, around 11 p.m., the home of Chen Buzhao, a native of Qingjiang residing at No. 70 Fulu Lane, Yangshupu Road, was invaded by multiple bandits who robbed valuables worth over four hundred yuan.

The Yangshupu police station was notified and dispatched Detective Chief Sun Afu and Detective Su Yinggen to search for the perpetrators, but without success. It turned out that the leaders of the bandit gang, Liu Yulong from Siyang and Tang Bingguang from Guangdong, along with A Bao (also known as Zhang Guoliang) from Changzhou and Lin Changgen from Shaoxing, had attempted to rob the Fushunxiang Button Shop on Route A'erge in the French Concession on the 12th of last month at noon, opening fire and resisting arrest. As a result, they were all apprehended, and two handguns were confiscated. The Second Special Court, after questioning, sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment. Previously, Detective Chief Sun and Detective Su, who were handling the case at the Yangshupu police station, went to the Second Special Court and brought the four robbers, Liu, Tang, Chen, and Lin, back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Attorney Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department recounted the previous events, stating that the defendant Liu Yulong had admitted at the police station to having conspired with Li Si, Wu Zhongxing, Xu Guangrong, and others, who are still at large, in the robbery case at Chen Buzhao's home in Fulu Lane, Yangshupu Road, and admitted to shooting and wounding Chen, Zhang, and Shi. Tang Bingguang was identified at the police station by the victims, Zhang Jin Yang and Shi Jinshi, as being present at the scene. The handgun Liu Yulong carried in the French Concession robbery had the number 15084, Huang's brand, and its bullets were the same as those that wounded Chen Buzhao. However, the gun was not brought and requested the court to send a letter to the Second Special Court, the police station would send detectives to collect it. As for the two defendants, Chen and Lin, they should be detained and investigated regarding the Chen Buzhao case and requested an extension. The police station's statement from Liu was presented for review. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants and ordered them to be returned to detention for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Shanghai White and Red Wood Industry Workers' Union recently resolved that all stores purchasing wood must have it delivered to the store by traders and then notify the sawmill workers to come and saw it. The union also restricted workers from transporting wood themselves from the traders' carts. There was a worker named Ji Zihai from Jiangbei, 43 years old, residing at No. 24, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street outside Xiaonanmen, who worked as a sawmill worker. Yesterday, Ji was hired by Wang Renji's Wood Shop and went to the Taijiang Wood Firm, transported a section of redwood home in a cart, and began to saw it. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by his fellow worker Yu Changcheng (40 years old, from Wenzhou) from No. 15 in the same lane, who believed Ji was deliberately violating the union's regulations. So, yesterday morning around 8 a.m., Yu gathered over forty fellow workers from the Wenzhou gang and rushed to Ji's home to prevent him from sawing the wood. Ji refused and also gathered over twenty fellow workers from the Jiangbei gang, and they argued with each other. When the two sides disagreed, they each grabbed wooden sticks and started a brawl. The Patrol Street Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was informed and immediately dispatched a large number of patrol officers who rushed to the scene and arrested the ringleaders, Ji and Yu, along with over twenty workers from both gangs. However, several people were injured, and the rest fled. The officers then brought the arrested individuals back to the station, where Director Jin interrogated them separately. Considering the case involved a large-scale brawl, he ordered a written report to be prepared and sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

He soon died. Someone reported the incident to Patrol Officer Zhang Xixi of the Caohejing Police Station, who then ordered Bao Xue Linsheng to report to the court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhang Zi of the court arrived at the scene with the coroner for examination. The coroner found that the deceased was wearing a blue linen short shirt and trousers with a straw raincoat, and a copper basin hat. The examination confirmed that he died from internal injuries caused by being kicked by a cow. He filled out the death certificate and ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial pending further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e183">The Organizing Committee of the Current National Games Announces: Summary of New Rules for the Track and Field All-Around Competition; Also Announces Rules for Women's Javelin Throw Demonstration <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Organizing Committee of the Sixth National Games issued its second announcement yesterday, which included a summary of the new rules for track and field all-around competitions, race walking, and women's softball throw, as well as points to note when registering with various units. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Summary of New Rules for the Track and Field All-Around Competition</p>
<p>The international sports associations have made slight modifications to the rules for track and field events and all-around sports. In addition, the rules for women's softball throwing were previously lacking in our track and field competition rules. They are now included together with the new rules and explained as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Modification of Timing Methods: For timing in track races, any fraction of a second less than one second was previously calculated as one-tenth of a second for distances of 250 meters or less, and as one-fifth of a second for distances greater than 250 meters. The International Sports Association has now decided that for track distances of 1,000 meters or less, the fraction of a second will be calculated as one-tenth of a second, and for distances greater than 1,000 meters, it will be calculated as one-fifth of a second.</p>
<p>(B) Modification of Hurdling Rules: A new note has been added to Article 6 of Chapter 38, 110-meter hurdles, with the full text as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) If new hurdles are used, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>An athlete who knocks down one or more hurdles will not be disqualified, and the resulting score may be recognized as an official record. According to the resolution of the International Sports Association conference held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 1934, new and old hurdles of all types can be used until the end of 1936. The World Games to be held in Berlin, Germany, in 1936 will use the new hurdles. (The same applies to 400-meter hurdles)</p>
<p>In addition, a new section on the construction of new hurdles has been added to Chapter 53, with the full text as follows:</p>
<p>The hurdle is made of wood or metal, with two bases and two posts, supported by a rectangular frame. The frame can use one or several horizontal bars for strength. The posts are each installed at one end of the base, and the height of the hurdle can be raised or lowered arbitrarily, but there must be a way to stop it at various heights. The structure of the hurdle is legally overturned when a force of 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds) or more is applied to the center of the hurdle. The top is painted with alternating black and white diagonal stripes.</p>
<p>Height: The height of the hurdle is detailed in the rules. Hurdle dimensions: 1.20 meters (3 feet 11 inches) high, base length 70 cm (27.5 inches), each hurdle weighs at least 10 kilograms (22.22 pounds).</p>
<p>Placement: The hurdle should be placed with the end of the base with the post at the front, i.e., the side closer to the finish line, and the empty end of the base facing the starting line.</p>
<p>(C) Softball Throwing Rules: Chapter 60, "Softball Throwing," has been added to the track and field rules, with the full text as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The softball should be thrown from behind the throwing line. The construction of the throwing line is the same as for the javelin throw.</p>
<p>Article 2: The diameter of the softball is 30 cm (12 inches). When throwing the softball, it should be thrown with one hand over the shoulder. Throwing from the side or diagonally is invalid.</p>
<p>Article 3: When throwing the softball, the feet must not touch the throwing line.</p>
<p>Article 4: The athlete must not cross the throwing line before the ball lands.</p>
<p>Article 5: The distance is measured at a right angle from the closest point where the ball lands to the inner edge of the throwing line or its extension. (Note) The referee may instruct the athlete to lightly coat the ball with lime before throwing to easily identify the landing point.</p>
<p>Article 6: All articles of Chapter 32 that are relevant to this chapter shall apply.</p>
<p>(D) Modification of Scoring Tables for the Decathlon and Pentathlon</p>
<p>The old scoring tables for the decathlon and pentathlon had the problem of addition and subtraction calculations during inspection. The Finnish Sports Association has now drafted new ones, which were adopted at the International Sports Association conference held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 1934. This table has a wider range of applications. The score that should be given for any result can be found with a quick check, without the need for addition and subtraction calculations, saving time and effort, and avoiding the drawbacks of scoring errors. In addition, this scoring table has another advantage, namely that the level of scoring is lower than the old one, so items with poorer results will not be without points, which will prevent athletes from feeling disappointed. This new scoring table has been printed into the track and field competition rules of the conference and will be distributed to various units for use in mid-July.</p>
<p>Race Walking Demonstration Distance and Rules</p>
<p>(A) Distance</p>
<p>The distances for the race walking demonstration competition at this conference are temporarily set at 50,000 meters and 30,000 meters, to be held on two days. Both will be held on the road, but the starting and ending points will be within the track and field stadium. The route will be measured and announced later with a map.</p>
<p>(B) Rules</p>
<p>(Definition) When an athlete is moving, the feet move forward and backward, alternately touching the ground, without both feet leaving the ground at the same time. This is called race walking and is the main difference from running. Therefore, the rules for race walking are only two very simple ones: (1) When one foot moves forward, the knee joint must be straight when the heel touches the ground and not bent. (2) The foot behind must only be lifted to move forward after the foot in front has touched the ground. (For example, when the left foot moves forward, the knee joint must be straight when it touches the ground. This is the inevitable result of a legal walking step. Only after the left foot has touched the ground can the right foot be lifted and moved forward. If the right foot is lifted before the left foot has touched the ground, the whole body will naturally be in the air, which is running, which is not consistent with the definition of race walking and constitutes a foul.)</p>
<p>Article 1: During a race walking competition, if a referee believes that an athlete's walking method is about to be a foul but has not yet constituted a foul, he may first give a warning.</p>
<p>Article 2: During a race walking competition, if two referees both believe that an athlete's walking method does not conform to the definition of race walking, he should be immediately disqualified, and any one of the two referees should give a formal notification to the athlete who committed the foul. If it is not possible to notify the athlete who was disqualified for a foul in a timely manner, it may be carried out immediately after the competition is over, and its effect is the same as notifying it when the foul occurred.</p>
<p>Article 3: If the competition is held on the track, the athlete must leave the track immediately when he is notified of the disqualification. If the competition is held on the road, the athlete must automatically remove the number cloth prepared when he is notified of the disqualification.</p>
<p>(Note) During a race walking competition, it is best to use various signals for notification, such as raising a white flag to indicate a warning and raising a red flag to indicate disqualification, so that all staff, athletes, and spectators can easily understand. However, this signal is not required in the competition.</p>
<p>Key Points of Women's Softball Rules</p>
<p>(1) Each unit must fill out the type of event to be participated in on the form and send it to the meeting before September 10. This procedure is necessary to estimate the number of participants from each unit and to arrange the order of the ball games. Only after receiving this registration form can the association estimate the number of participants from each unit and calculate the dormitory location in advance, so that it can cope with it comfortably and avoid the disadvantages of cramped and unsuitable accommodation. The order of the ball games can also be arranged in advance, so as to avoid the rush in printing the order and the occurrence of inconsistencies. Therefore, it is hoped that each unit will not regard this registration procedure as unimportant and ignore it. Overseas or remote units may use telegraph registration if time is limited, but it should be described clearly so that no errors occur. In addition, each unit should pay close attention to the provisions of Article 33 of Chapter 19 of the competition rules and consider it carefully in advance.</p>
<p>(2) Each unit must send the complete registration form for all athletes to the association before September 20, so that the preliminary classification can be arranged and everything related to the competition can be published in detail in the order book. This form is printed into a book, and each page can be written in triplicate at the same time with carbon paper. Each unit should tear off the first two sheets of each page, divide them into two copies and send them to the association, and keep the remaining one copy for reference. In the previous National Games, the registration of athletes from each unit was heard to be done by telegraph, and the descriptions were not clear enough, and there were many errors in the text. Not only was it difficult for the office to handle the matter, but each unit also felt inconvenient after the errors occurred. Therefore, when registering this year, each unit hopes to fill out and send the official forms issued by the association in accordance with the provisions of Article 34 of Chapter 19 of the competition rules. When sending the forms, each unit also hopes to consider the time required for mailing and send them out with sufficient time before the deadline, so that the association can receive them in a timely manner and avoid delaying the allocation work and the compilation and printing of the order book. To achieve this, all remote units and overseas Chinese groups should hold preliminary elections before the end of August, and immediately select representatives, fill out the forms and send them.</p>
<p>(3) The athlete number cloths for the track and field competitions, all-around sports, swimming, martial arts, and various demonstration competitions of each unit will be prepared by the association and issued according to the number of people on the registration form when each unit reports. Therefore, please do not fill in the athlete number grids for the above competitions in the registration form yourself.</p>
<p>(4) Number cloths for ball game athletes will not be issued separately. Therefore, when making uniforms, each unit must make the number and unit name at the same time, and the number of ball game athletes should be filled in by each unit on the registration form. Each unit should pay special attention to this, and when ordering the uniforms of each athlete, the number should be consistent with the one filled in on the registration form. This matter is extremely necessary for the competition and for the audience, and it is hoped that each unit will implement it in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(5) Conflicts in the timing of various competitions are virtually unavoidable. Therefore, each unit should select athletes carefully.</p>
<p>(6) The association plans to divide the track and field competition schedule into six days this time, in order to reduce the difficulty of athletes participating in several events at the same time and to achieve better results. Therefore, if athletes participate in events that are reasonable, there should be no conflicts or excessive fatigue. The all-around sports are planned to be held for two days, following the track and field competition. Swimming is planned to be held for five days, starting at the same time as the all-around sports. Units with athletes who participate in both all-around and swimming should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(7) Ball games will be very crowded in the first few days, but the association is determined to try its best to ensure that no two competitions are held at the same time for each unit in the preliminary rounds. However, after the preliminary rounds, the outcome of each week is difficult to predict, and it is inevitable that they will be held at the same time. Each unit should carefully consider the players who have two or more types of games.</p>
<p>(8) According to the provisions of Article 16 (a) of Chapter 9 of the tennis competition rules, the tennis players should be filled in according to the level of each player's skills in the order of first singles, second singles, etc. In the future, when attending the competition, if the first singles cannot play, the second singles should be promoted to fill in, and any one of the remaining four people should be supplemented as the second singles. If both the first and second singles do not attend, then they should still be supplemented in order, and no reversal is allowed. Therefore, each unit should pay attention to this when filling out the form, and it is hoped that each will arrange it sincerely. As for doubles, it can be composed of any two people. Regardless of singles or doubles, once the first competition is over, the players who attend can no longer be replaced.</p>
<p>(9) There is a athlete event comparison table for track and field competitions, all-around sports, and martial arts. Each unit must fill it out according to the format and send it together with other registration forms. Because there is a fixed quota for the number of items that each athlete joins and the number of athletes who join each item for the above competitions, this comparison table can avoid errors in the number. Therefore, you should not be afraid of being bothered and fill out the form according to the table for easy reference. If the comparison table filled out by each unit does not match the registration form, the association will base it on the registration form. If an athlete participates in more items than the quota, or if more athletes participate in an item than the quota, the association may arbitrarily cancel any item or any person, and each unit shall not object.</p>
<p>(10) Relay races in women's track and field competitions and men's and women's swimming are not within the fixed quota of participating items. In other words, those who participate in relay races can have a maximum of five items. In addition, six people can be filled in when registering for relays, and any four of them can attend during the competition, but after preparation, the semi-finals and finals must still be attended by these four people, and no changes are allowed.</p>
<p>(11) There is a fixed quota for various ball game players, and no more can be filled in. Otherwise, the association may arbitrarily remove any one or several people, and those who are under quota will listen. However, after registration, no request can be made to add up to the fixed number.</p>
<p>(12) If there are any deletions or changes on various registration forms, the person in charge should add a seal on the bottom page (that is, the originally written page) to show solemnity.</p>
<p>(13) The number of staff and athletes in each unit shall be limited to what is filled in on the registration form. The association's reception and issuance of badges will be based on this.</p>
<p>(14) If an athlete who has been registered in each unit cannot attend due to some reason, the competent authority may prepare an official letter and apply to the association for replacement before September 30. It will be invalid after the deadline (the date of the Shanghai Post Office stamp shall prevail), and this replacement is only limited to athletes, not the items to be participated in. Therefore, the replaced athlete should still participate in the items that the original registered athlete intended to participate in, and no other items can be changed or new items added.</p>
<p>(15) In addition to the above registration forms, the association also prepares a personal registration certificate for athletes. Each unit should instruct the athletes to fill it out according to the style, striving for details, and attach a 2.5-inch half-length photo for reference. This athlete registration certificate can be brought to the association when each unit reports and does not need to be sent.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Conference Accommodation Arrangements: Meals are Arranged by Each Unit; Accommodation is Provided by the Conference <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The number of participants in this conference is expected to be very enthusiastic, and it is not possible to eat together at the same time. Therefore, each meal is divided into two openings (the type, price, and time are indicated on the meal ticket). The types and prices of the three meals are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Breakfast: Congee and pickled vegetables, 8 people per table, price 1 yuan. If you add 20 steamed buns, add another 4 jiao.</p>
<p>(B) Lunch and Dinner: Dishes are divided into 5 types: Ordinary, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Cantonese, and Halal, with 8 people per table. The prices are divided into 2.4 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan, and 5.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The meals for the athletes and staff of each unit shall be arranged by the respective units. However, the above-mentioned dishes must be decided in advance and contracted to reliable restaurants. Each unit is requested to inform the association in writing of the number of people and the type and price of dishes required two weeks before the opening of the conference, so that the overall plan can be made. After the delegation reports, the fee must be paid to the catering department of the general affairs section of the association before 5 pm every day to receive the meal tickets for the next day (divided into table tickets and individual tickets), so that the contractor can be notified to prepare in advance, so as to avoid being caught short in an emergency and the drawbacks of surplus or insufficient food. If each unit is dissatisfied with the meals provided, it can report to the staff of the catering department, and it is hoped that it will not be handled directly.</p>
<p>Regarding the meals of the referees of the conference, lunch will be provided by the association on the spot. Each person will be issued a meal ticket for lunch, and they can sit and eat with the ticket. They can eat individually or with several people. The cafeteria is separated from the athletes. Breakfast and dinner for out-of-town referees will be provided by the association at the accommodation. Breakfast and dinner for local referees will not be provided.</p>
<p>The meals for the audience will be arranged by the conference in designated locations and rented to various restaurants and vendors. The audience can buy food freely, but the restaurants that contract to provide meals for the conference are restricted from soliciting these yellow customers.</p>
<p>The accommodation for the athletes and staff of each unit will be planned by the conference as a whole, and the dormitory of the venue will be allocated for residence. All related personnel of each unit who are not within the scope of the association's reception shall not be allowed to stay. The daily necessities of each athlete and staff member shall be prepared by themselves.</p>

The spring workshop has already ended, and a summer art workshop will be held starting on July 8th, so that those who usually lack the opportunity to study can use the summer vacation to get pure supplementary instruction. The study hours are from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Whether you have studied before or not, anyone who is interested in art, regardless of gender, is welcome to join.

<p>— (Lan Shan)</p>
<p>In the courtroom, the plaintiff and defendant eloquently stated their cases, recounting the details of the matter. Then, lawyers from both sides presented various pieces of evidence, refuting each other's claims. It was truly a case of "the public has its reasons, and the wife has her reasons." At that time, onlookers could only listen and observe, finding it difficult to know which side was right or wrong. Only after several trials did the truth come to light. The winning party breathed a sigh of relief and beamed with joy, while the losing party hung their head in dejection. This moment reveals the existence of "right" and "wrong" in the world, and it is the most precious instant.</p>
<p>Kidnappers, robbers, and others who have committed serious crimes deserving of death have not completely extinguished their "conscience." On the day of execution, after eating a few farewell steamed buns and drinking a cup of parting wine, they feel the terror of impending death. Thinking about their past mistakes and the inevitable punishment of the law, their hearts awaken at this moment, followed by remorse and tears. They yearn for this colorful and strange life. Who can comprehend even a fraction of the sorrow of their state of mind at this time? Their repentance is necessary, but it is too late. (Why not carefully consider the consequences before committing the crime?)</p>
<h3 id="e204">Superstitions About Smoking <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Foreigners often say that Chinese people are superstitious, but in fact, there are countless superstitious beliefs among foreigners as well. Taking the act of smoking cigarettes as an example, foreigners have ten times more superstitions than Chinese people.</p>
<p>In the rural areas of northern Scotland, there is a popular and unbelievable belief that if a cigarette that is being smoked suddenly goes out on its own, the smoker will encounter great misfortune in the near future. If the cigarette comes unglued and bursts open while being smoked, it is a sign that the smoker will commit a crime and be imprisoned. In western Spain, along the Atlantic coast, residents absolutely refuse to share a cigarette. Their superstition is that if two people share a cigarette, the first smoker's wife will commit adultery. Before the revolution in Russia, people also had a widespread superstition that if a cigarette butt thrown on the ground burned completely, good luck would come, but if it did not burn completely, it did not signify bad luck, but only that unexpected good fortune would not be obtained. In Hungary in the late nineteenth century, it was popular to tell fortunes about future husbands or wives by smoking cigarettes. Generally, a cigarette that could be smoked smoothly and effortlessly would lead to a satisfactory partner in the near future. If a cigarette had to be relit, came unglued, burst open, or burned in a distorted way, it was a sign of an unsuccessful marriage.</p>
<p>In China, the fire on a cigarette cannot be given to someone else to light another cigarette, especially among gamblers, who consider it a great taboo, saying that if someone else takes your fire, you will definitely lose money gambling.</p>
<h3 id="e205">God of Wealth, A Wu <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"God of Wealth, A Wu" was not a wealthy millionaire, but a beggar who went door to door. He was able to have this name only after undergoing three transformations. First: everyone called him "Young Master Wu." Needless to say, at this time, he was a playboy enjoying the blessings of his parents. Second: everyone called him "Wu Xiang," because at this time, his fields had been sold off, and his house had been sold. He lived by borrowing money. Third: only then did he have the name "A Wu." At this time, his wife had also run away with someone else. He relied on a bamboo pole and a broken basket, begging from door to door. However, I was somewhat puzzled by the addition of "God of Wealth" to "A Wu." If it was to commemorate his past wealth, then there were many royal descendants in the humble fields. If it was to mock him, he may have been extravagant in his youth, but he may not have done evil. Why be so harsh on him? Later, I asked the elderly and learned the origin of the name "God of Wealth."</p>
<p>It turned out that his father was a great wealthy man in his lifetime. However, he was stingy by nature and would not help anyone, and he might have been very harsh to people. After the age of fifty, he only had four daughters and no sons. In the past, daughters had no right to inherit property, and he was afraid that no one would offer sacrifices after his death, so he always wanted to have a son. He was a person who did somersaults in the eyes of money, so he worshiped the God of Wealth at home, and he also burned incense to the God of Wealth at temples. He prayed to the God of Wealth day and night. In his dream, he saw the God of Wealth rewarding him with a silver ingot, laughing heartily, but waking up, it was just a dream, and Young Master Wu was born at this time.</p>
<p>He thought that the God of Wealth had bestowed the gift, and he would definitely become the second "Shen Wansan" in the future, so he did not teach him to study, nor did he teach him a trade, letting him roam and waste his time. Later, when he closed his eyes, "Young Master Wu" gradually turned into "God of Wealth, A Wu"!</p>
<p>"Leaving wealth to descendants is not as good as leaving education to descendants." After learning about the life of God of Wealth, A Wu, I believe even more that this saying is true.</p>

<p>Bei Hai lowered his head and wiped up the spilled tea on the tea table. He didn't look up until the waiter had left. Zhi Qian smiled: Miss Yang said that nothing moves people more than sincere words. We managed to pull Miss Zhu out of a difficult situation, so your enthusiasm wasn't for nothing. Bei Hai looked pleased. Zhi Qian continued: I have more good news. Magistrate Zhou is very enthusiastic. He said that if you marry her, he's willing to help you financially. Bei Hai found a piece of paper under the tea table and wiped his hands. Zhi Qian poured a cup of tea and asked, "If you're really determined, you should talk to your parents and then come talk to me." Bei Hai paused for a moment, then stood up and said, "There's nothing to talk about." After saying only five words, he fell silent. They sat in silence for a while. Bei Hai felt bored, so he asked: Did you want to see me today to discuss something, Mr. Cheng? Zhi Qian replied: What I wanted to say, I just said. First, I want to make it clear that I have no intentions. Second, I advise you to consider it. Bei Hai said: I don't have anything... He didn't finish what he wanted to say, his voice was very soft, and he stopped. Zhi Qian smiled: If there's something you don't want to discuss in front of people today, we can talk about it another day. Bei Hai said it was getting late and bid farewell to return to school. Zhi Qian sat in the room, feeling a great deal of emotion. He propped up his head, sat at the table, and just thought aimlessly. He didn't know how much time had passed, but he heard the sound of silver dollars falling to the ground. (254)</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Misty Records of Imperial Incense <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Finally, the four imperial physicians completed their pulse-taking work. At almost the same time, they suddenly got up, kowtowed to the Empress Dowager as usual, and tiptoed out of the inner palace. The Empress Dowager did not speak directly to them but said to me:</p>
<p>"Der Ling, you go out with them and keep an eye on them!"</p>
<p>Her tone was still very sharp, obviously because she had not completely suppressed her anger! But her intention in telling me to go out was not because of this. Judging from her daily actions, I suspected that she did not fully trust the four imperial physicians. So, I quickly obeyed and followed the four imperial physicians into a side hall adjacent to the Empress Dowager's bedroom. There, four small, low tables and chairs had been set up in advance, with pens, inkstones, paper, and ink placed on the tables. The four imperial physicians each occupied a seat and sat down respectfully. First, each of them silently wrote a set of pulse records. After finishing the set of pulse records, they began to discuss them, each expressing their own opinions. As a result, the four people had four different opinions, none of which were the same. This was certainly not acceptable! The four people then tried their best to compromise, agreed on a consensus, and destroyed the first set of pulse records, replacing them with a set of largely identical phrases. The Empress Dowager's condition was determined by such speculation and discussion! Next, the four physicians had to come up with their own prescriptions. When writing the prescriptions, they seemed to be even more solemn than when writing the pulse records. Each of them pondered and murmured, working as diligently as students facing a major exam. It took them a long time to complete the task. However, they no longer discussed the use of medication but came up with their own ideas. As a result, four different prescriptions were produced.

<h3 id="e209">Sketches of Japanese Customs <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Men and Women Living Together in the Natsudomari Tribe</p>
<p>In the Natsudomari tribe of Ketaka County, Tottori Prefecture, Japan, there are a total of 70 households with 450 people. Because it is close to the Sea of Japan, everyone relies on fishing for a living. Every year from June 1st to September 15th is the fishing season. Women aged 15 to 30 are very busy during that season, competing to catch fish. The men stay at home to sort the fish and shellfish and sell them to various villages and towns. In the autumn, gathering aromatic herbs is also the only side business for the women of the Natsudomari tribe, and the income is not small.</p>
<p>In the Natsudomari tribe, there are three customs that are different from other places: the nationally famous men and women living together, praying for the birth of girls, and collective pilgrimages.</p>
<p>Men and women living together is called "Wakashu Yado" or [blank space] [blank space] in Japanese, which means young men and women living together. In a large room, a folding screen divides the space into two rooms, with a large stove placed in the gap of the screen. After dinner, the young men and women each bring two or three bundles of firewood or four or five pieces of charcoal and come to the large stove in the room. The men and women sit together, chat and laugh, shake hands and nudge shoulders, without any restrictions. The men either knit fishing nets or repair furniture, while the women either make shoes and hats or sew clothes. When the night is late, the men go to one room on the left, and the women go to the room on the right, each going to sleep.</p>
<p>Because of this custom, the sexuality of young men and women is liberated before marriage, and the harm of early maturity is inevitable. Early marriage has become the norm in the entire village. Almost no girls over the age of fourteen and no boys over the age of sixteen are virgins. After a physical relationship has occurred and they get along well, they get permission from their parents and then hold a formal wedding ceremony. Therefore, there are many illegitimate children in this village, but once they get married, there are never any divorce tragedies.</p>
<p>The custom of praying for the birth of girls is considered extremely strange in Japan. Because almost all parts of Japan are biased in favor of boys over girls, women are generally respected in this village. Therefore, every woman, after being three months pregnant, goes to the local shrine to worship, either with the village leader or with her husband, to pray for a safe birth and a strong and beautiful girl.</p>
<p>If they know it's a girl at the time of delivery, not only is the whole family happy, but the people of the entire village are very happy. When the girl turns four, she must be thrown into the sea during the summer festival. So, before the summer festival, the parents must teach the girl to swim every day so that she is not harmed.</p>
<p>Collective pilgrimages are also called [blank space] [blank space] by the Japanese. The residents of this village often gather ten or twenty people each year, and sometimes even forty or fifty people as a group, to take a long trip together. Although the destination of the trip is not fixed, it is always mainly temples and shrines, mostly in the Shikoku area and the Shodo Island area. As for the metropolises such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, they have probably never been to one, so they simply do not know the most developed state of Japanese culture. However, after traveling once, they can add a lot of new material when men and women sit around the stove talking and laughing on long winter nights. Everyone often tells each other about the beautiful women they encountered in the various hotels. I don't know if the women in that village feel any jealousy after hearing this?</p>

<h3 id="e210">Finance; Bank Closing Period; Call Loan Interest Rate Still at 20%; Corner Coin Market Price Remains Firm <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the first half of the year for the banking sector. As usual, banks were closed for two days for settlement purposes. Therefore, receipts and payments with other banks and money shops were temporarily suspended. The call loan interest rate in the money market remained at 20% in the morning and afternoon, maintaining its original state. It can be seen that the money supply has not eased, causing the call loan market to remain firm. Due to the bank holiday, the exchange market was closed and there was no trading. The morning turnover of the call loan market was over 1.8 million, with new trades of over 300,000. The afternoon turnover was over 200,000, and the turnover in the small general clearing was over 600,000. The settlement of Yang Gong notes at money shops was over 31 million, and remittances from various routes were over 300,000. The rest was not known due to the bank closure. As for the subsidiary coin market, corner coins remained firm. Jiangnan small silver coins opened at 833 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a continuation of 2 yuan higher than the previous market. 4,000 corner coins were transacted in the morning market and 2,000 corner coins in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins also improved slightly by 7 jiao in the morning market, at 733 yuan. The afternoon market continued to rise by 3 jiao, changing to 733 yuan and 3 jiao. Therefore, the result was also 1 yuan better than before. 120,000 corner coins were transacted in the morning market and 50,000 corner coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 cash from the previous day, to 340,000 cash. The transaction volume was 40,800 strings of cash, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Foodstuffs: Excessive Rainfall Causes Flour and Wheat to Rise Together <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has seen universal and rapid increases. The price of imported wheat rose by one dollar yesterday, but today it only increased by around forty-eight to twenty cents. The Yangtze River and Jiangsu-Zhejiang areas are experiencing excessive mold-inducing rains, leading to concerns about potential flooding. People cannot help but worry deeply about the future of food supplies. On Sunday, Tianjin also managed to trade 60,000 to 70,000 bags of Fufeng spot goods, with prices already reaching 2.435 dollars per bag (more than seven and a half cents higher than the July closing price). Due to these various reasons, everyone expects prices to be high. Both domestic and out-of-town merchants are buying in large quantities, leading to an average market increase of four to five cents. However, factories have been selling off some stock, and the quantity is considerable. By the afternoon opening, the weather seemed to be clearing up, so out-of-town merchants' buying interest decreased relatively. Factories continued to sell, and speculators also resold. Therefore, near and far-term prices fell by about one cent. Observing the future trend, if the weather does not clear up, people will still have positive expectations, and the market will likely remain stable. As a result, this month's price rose by three and a half cents, next month's by four cents, September's by three cents and seven mills, October's by two cents and seven mills. December has already been sold, initially opening at four dollars and eight cents, and closing down by seven mills.</p>
<p>The wheat market's opening prices this morning were unusually high because foreign wheat prices have risen by an average of one dollar in the past two days. Domestically, there was a severe drought before, and now there is flooding. The irregular weather has affected food supplies. Furthermore, the new wheat arrival this year is only abundant in the Jiangnan region. New wheat from Anhui, Hubei, and areas above Bengbu is rarely being shipped. Considering the environment, people are greatly shaken. Therefore, opening prices immediately rose by six, seven, or eight cents. Later, the price fluctuated less. Trading remained brisk in the afternoon because the flour market slightly declined, and people's enthusiasm also seemed weaker. As a result, this month's price rose by six cents, August's by five cents, September's by six cents, and October's by seven cents. The current wheat market prices, due to the rain and the increase in standards, are also rising by five or six cents. However, major factories are not greedy and have already sold 20,000 to 30,000 bags, preventing prices from rising too much. The opening prices are: Baliangnan Suzhou wheat at 3.58 dollars, Linhuaiguan wheat at 3.55 dollars, Jiangxinzhou wheat at 3.478 dollars, Gaozi Danyang wheat at 3.47 dollars, Hushu Yaowan wheat at 3.46 dollars, Yanghu wheat at 3.58 dollars, Bacheng wheat at 3.52 dollars, Kunshan wheat at 3.50 dollars, Penglai Anting wheat at 3.49 dollars, Waigang wheat at 3.456 dollars. Shan Fufeng sold 3,000 bags, Shenda sold 2,000 bags, Fuxin sold 1,100 bags, and Xinda sold 1,600 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Continuous Mold-Inducing Rains Slightly Improve the Price of Domestic and Foreign Rice <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Due to continuous rain, the source of domestic rice (South Shanghai) yesterday was only at the 5th district (with nearly 1,000 piculs of goods arriving). There are still about 100 districts in the Pudong area, so people's minds are slightly settled, and the market is tight. The prices of various Hougeng and Baodao rice varieties only fluctuate by a few cents. Future trends depend on weather changes and the amount of arriving ships. The price of the Yinyuan market is still weak, continuing to fall by about ten cents. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten sources arrived from various areas along the river. Although the weather is continuously rainy, the sales of various types of rice in the market are decent. Baijing is slightly better, with high-quality goods holding steady, medium-quality goods slightly tighter by a few cents, and Baodao rice slightly tightening. The sales of Baiyuan rice are still slow, and the price is not affected. Other goods have little fluctuation. The initial rice market yesterday saw flat production prices, abundant supplies arriving in Shanghai, and sluggish sales. People and the market generally felt a need for prices to fall. However, the floods in various provinces along the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang suddenly occurred, causing the market to change. Yesterday, domestic merchants' sales gradually became active, with responses from Tianjin, Nanjing, and the Yangtze River area. The prices of all grades of rice improved by five or six cents. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, prices may need to be increased step by step. A total of 12,500 bags of Saigon rice, 1,500 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and over 1,000 bags of Sugengdi Siam rice were sold throughout the day. With brisk transactions, the future outlook is stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sales of soybean cakes were quite active. In addition to domestic merchants, there were also merchants from Quanzhou asking about Tianjin. Some factories were also buying, so the market was quite good. Prices saw an increase of a few cents. A total of over 32,000 pieces of various brands of cakes were traded, including factory purchases. It is still difficult to grasp the overall situation. Due to the lack of current cakes in factories, market prices are prone to rise. However, sales are hindered by the unclear weather, so the increase is not rapid, resulting in fluctuating prices. Sales of yellow soybeans were average. Yesterday, only 1,700 to 1,800 bags were traded, and the price trend was down by one or two cents. (Note: Due to the limited space in this newspaper, some news is often missed. Important news will be published the next day. The news about the cake market published yesterday was what was missed the day before. Because it was during the sales season, it was added. Unexpectedly, it caused misunderstandings in the market. This is to clarify.)</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market is calm and still. Due to tight credit, the spot market is still sluggish, and the price of foreign yarn is relatively low, causing people's sentiment to be weak. However, Sichuan merchants are gradually becoming active, purchasing more. Other merchant groups, such as Guangdong, still have weak purchasing power. According to statistics of purchases by various merchants yesterday, including the previous day's transactions, only 327 bales were sold. Prices fell by fifty cents.

<p>——No Changes in Cotton——</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn appraisal meeting on June 26 for the purpose of delivery in December of the 24th year. As a result of the review, except for the newly added 20-count "Awakening Lion" yarn produced by the Lintai Yarn Factory in Taicang, there were no changes in the other 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count yarns, which remained the same as in the November period. The changes to the "Awakening Lion" brand are listed below:</p>
<p>20-count Awakening Lion Yarn Newly set price: reduced by four yuan</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cotton appraisal meeting for the December period found no changes in grades one, two, three, and four, which remained the same as in the November period.</p>

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The Xihua cotton market is calm, with a slightly soft trend. A lively market is brewing but difficult to realize. Japanese merchants are slightly interested, buying 70 bales at an opening price of 34.7 yuan and another 123 bales at an opening price of 34.5 yuan. The yarn market situation is average, with thin transactions. Tianjin factories bought 17-count Baochi yarn at 163.5 yuan for 50 bales of Bama yarn, and 20 bales of 17-count Dafu yarn at 163.5 yuan (including unified tax).</p>

<p>Bombay: Last week, cotton prices were slightly soft due to the lack of encouraging news from New York. At the beginning of the week, some bulls closed their positions due to the sharp drop in silver prices. Afterwards, due to weak demand, there was no improvement. The market is paying attention to the developments in Washington and the political situation in Europe. Export inquiries are scarce. Shanghai has made some shipments. Factories are only purchasing for immediate needs. Monsoon rains are active, and all cotton-producing areas have received rainfall. The initial cotton harvest is going smoothly. The statistics for the previous week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1934 1935</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1 2,232 2,341</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 1,081 718</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1 1,249 1,463</p>

<p>Exports to Japan 743 990</p>
<p>Other Regions 17 28</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales improved last week, and forward cotton was dim. Most of the trading was between cotton industry colleagues. Prices were relatively high due to few transactions. The harvest report deteriorated. However, before the agricultural adjustment loan is confirmed, it is expected that market prices will not fluctuate significantly. The Egyptian cotton market is quiet. Colleagues are the only major buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Raincoat cloth sales are brisk and timely, especially in this port. Businessmen's interest has suddenly increased due to the continuous rain. Single-sided open-width American cloth and Japanese double-sided yarn cloth are particularly popular. Single-sided open-width American raincoat cloth is mostly designated for Chinese and Western-style raincoats. Japanese double-sided yarn cloth is mostly used for military police raincoats. Other leather-faced raincoat cloths have seen a sharp decline in actual sales because of the use of aviation raincoat leaves. Elephant skin-lined thin raincoat cloth has become obsolete in recent years. However, new clothing Zhuang merchants still have a few trial sales. Yesterday, 4026 open-width American raincoat cloth was publicly bid at 5 yuan uniformly. Ordinary brands of single-sided open-width American cloth were wholesaled at 4.8 yuan, and second-grade goods were at 4.6 yuan. Japanese double-sided yarn raincoat cloth sells for 8.5 cents for first-grade, 6.5 cents for second-grade, and 5.25 cents for third-grade.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little fluctuation in Customs Gold Units. However, the bank's closing and market sales were related, and transactions were still few, trending toward weak and tired. The association's price for 24 crude sugar white spot goods was 16.05 yuan, and transit goods were 4.95 yuan, but no transactions were made. This warehouse's goods were 16.13 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar B wheat was 17.5 yuan, up five cents, with dozens of bags traded for each. This factory's cotton white Zhenyu No. 1 was 15.35 yuan, with few transactions. This factory's ice sugar price remained the same, but there were rumors of a slight loosening in the underground market, indicating that the market is not easily recovering. Numbered goods are generally lacking in redemption.</p>

<p>New Xuzhou golden needle vegetables have arrived in small quantities, only about twenty bags or so. The color is still good, and they were immediately bought up by Guangdong merchants. The price is three or four yuan higher than old goods. However, as this is the beginning of the new harvest, the quantity is too small to be considered the normal market. When more arrive, there may be a price drop.</p>

<p>Due to excessive rainfall in recent days, green tea from Tunxi and Zi Yuan could not be transported smoothly due to transportation obstacles. As a result, few goods have arrived recently. Yesterday, British merchants such as Xiehe, Tongfu, Baochang, and Tianyu continued to search for Road Zhuang drawn-core ordinary Zhen green tea. However, because the market inventory is depleted, there are few goods suitable for sale. In addition, the supply is scarce, so transactions are invisibly light. Except for Gongxi, which saw a decrease of one or two yuan, other tea markets are trending toward stability.</p>

<p>Yesterday's continuous rain coincided with the bank's closing period, so hardware transactions were very quiet. Merchants' transactions were halted due to transportation difficulties, and factories' purchases and sales were also few, so the market felt quite lonely. However, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Engineering Office bought over 400 dan of corrugated iron yesterday. The prices are 10.025 yuan per dan for No. 24, 10.075 yuan for No. 26, and 11.075 yuan for No. 28. Because foreign exchange is trending tight, the market price is harder than before. In addition, the current inventory is also limited, so the market situation is solid. It is heard that the overseas price is 12 pounds and 5 shillings per ton for the patterned color. It is heard that colleagues have not made purchases due to the notice from the association.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Articles Without an Attitude <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Jing</p>
<p>"Without an attitude" means that the author, whether describing a story or narrating a theory, does not express his own opinions about the story or theory at all. In other words, the author stands completely in a "purely objective" position, without any subjective opinions being mixed in. Is such an article possible?</p>
<p>This question has already been answered by someone, but despite the answer, practitioners are still using it. Advertisements stating that "the author stands in an objective position, narrates the course of events, and does not include any subjective opinions, truly a rare work" can still be seen everywhere. Even critics use such words to tout the value of the original work. I think this kind of specious concept is like opium, poisoning the brains and blood of young people.</p>
<p>I don't want to use any laws or theories to answer this question. Let's look at a few simple examples. For example, we write in an arithmetic textbook, "Two plus two equals four." This seems to be very objective and does not contain any subjective opinions, but it is not. It is true that "two plus two equals four" is an objective truth, but when we write it in a book, we are not just blindly copying it. First, it must be approved by our subjective judgment before we write it. If we subjectively believe that two plus two equals five, would we still be willing to write it as two plus two equals four? Another example is that most of the young women appearing in novels are described as beautiful and charming, but in reality, are there so many beautiful women? The reason is that humans have a subjective aesthetic sense of loving beauty and hating ugliness, so even if the woman the author wants to portray (naturally still a woman in the author's imagination) originally only has three parts beauty, it turns out to be ten parts beauty when written on paper.</p>
<p>In short, whether it is science or literature, as long as it is a text written on paper, it must contain the author's subjective opinions (there is only a difference in the amount of subjective components). There is no purely objective text in the world, but there are purely subjective works. Such purely subjective things are naturally worthless, just like the ravings of a madman. A valuable work—whether it is science or literature—must have the author's subjective opinions precisely matching the objective truth. In other words, it must be completed in the unified category of subject and object.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion and the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion was involved in a public case during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. Shen Defu's Guqu Zayan's comments on the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion say:</p>
<p>"In the past, in the year Gui Si, the young masters of Wu practiced martial arts, and were accused by the Jiangnan Pacification Commissioner Zhu Jiantang, saying that the young masters were about to rebel, and the poem they gave to their guests, 'You really have the heart to chase Ji Bu, but the humble home has no way to entrust Zhu Jia' was used as definite proof of rebellion. Censor Zhao Wanbi reported it to the emperor accordingly. At that time, the three ministers were all from Wu and Yue, fearing that the emperor would believe it to be true, they urgently requested to send Pacification Commissioners to investigate the truth. Zhu had already left office, and someone interceded for him, saying: This is from the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion opera, Tuo Man Xingfu gave it to Jiang Shilong, and Jiang gave this sentence in reply, not the creator. So they took the carved version from the market to prove it, and it was indeed so. The young masters' prison gradually dissolved, and Wang Fangzhong was also one of the young masters. Now, reading the new and old carved versions carefully, there is no such couplet. Could it be that when the great prison arose, they hated its implication and removed these two sentences? Or it is said: The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion originally had no such poem, but the resolver pretended to say this as a 'liaocheng arrow,' is that so?"</p>
<p>In Tan Qian's Zaolin Miscellaneous Congzheng's "Zhu Zhongcheng Mistakenly Reported Anti-Poetry" entry, there is also a similar record:</p>
<p>"Zhu Hongmo opened the mansion in Wuzhong. At that time, Guanbai was very alert. Wang Shi County of Taicang and others practiced archery in groups, or someone accused them of rebellion, and the manuscript 'You really have the heart to chase Ji Bu, but the humble home has no way to entrust Zhu Jia' was taken as evidence. Hongmo reported it to the emperor, and the matter was handed over to the Ministry of War.  Wu Yuan Cui告 Shangshu Shi Xing said: This is a phrase from the Yougui Ji opera, how can it be used as evidence? Show the book from the market, and the Shangshu was relieved."</p>
<p>According to this, the person who pointed out that these two lines of poetry are from the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion was Wu Yuan Cui. Wu once wrote Linju Manlu, but unfortunately I have not been able to read it. The inaugural issue of the Peking University History Journal has Zhang Jun's reading notes, which also mentions this matter in the Manlu. But I don't know what the details of the original book are? In the Qing Dynasty, Chu Renhuo's Jianhu Ji also has the same narrative, but it is more detailed:</p>
<p>"In the year Yiwei of Wanli, the people of Wu were all cautious because Guanbai was not yet pacified. Wang Fengzhou's second son Shi Lu, Yanling Qin Fangbo Yao, younger brother Deng, and Qiao Xian's eldest son Xiang of Yunjian were all proud of their noble status. Shi inherited his ability to write articles, Deng was good at talking, and Xiang was good at calligraphy, each with a reputation at the time, and they interacted with each other, entering and exiting the narrow streets. When they met the sea police, they all rolled up their sleeves and stood up, as if they were about to say: I will quell the Japanese pirates, I will establish unprecedented merits. At that time, the traitor Zhao Zhouping, hiding among the young masters, used them to make himself important. He always wore a sword and traveled to wine shops and gambling places, and was always with the young masters. For a time, everyone knew Zhao Zhouping. He casually threw a thorn at the rich man, saying: We want to start something, pacify the island bandits, and lend your family a thousand gold to inlay. The rich man was afraid, or lent him a hundred gold, or dozens of gold, otherwise he would often stare at him and say: You guard the gold for me, I will soon lead troops to quell you! The intention was to get the gold, so I made big words to scare them. The rich men saw him interacting with the young masters, and often wore a sword in and out, thinking that he would soon lead his party to rob me of gold, and shouted that Zhao Zhouping, Wang, Qi, Qiao and the young masters were about to rebel. The Inspector Zhu Jiantang (Hongmo) ordered the yamen to arrest and punish them, and reported the matter to the court. The memorial contained anti-poetry, with the sentence "You really have the heart to chase Ji Bu, but the humble home has no way to entrust Zhu Jia." It was handed over to the Ministry of War for discussion, and Wu Ningfang (Cui) said to the Minister of War Shi Xing: These two sentences are from the Yougui Ji, how can they be used as evidence? It was handed over to the Pacification Commissioner to investigate, question, and found nothing. After that, the essay on Zhouping and the death of Deng, Shi embroidered the border, and Xiang was assigned. People all thought it was a wrong. The case of suspicion was detained for a long time. (Omitted below)."</p>
<p>Probably because of the times, there was no need to be taboo, so the record of the facts was clearer than Shen's. Only the year was Yiwei, two years later than Shen's record. In these three notes, all said that the two anti-poetry lines were in the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion. Although Linju Manlu has not been seen, it is expected that Wu Yuan Cui's own record, the resolver, will not be an exception. So here comes the question! In the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion, there really is no such poem. Not only is it not in the versions circulating now, but in Shen Defu's day, he had already "checked all the new and old carvings" and deeply changed his suspicions. In Guqu Zayan, there is the phrase "Qingsui Dingyou", which should have been written in the 25th year of Wanli (1597), only five years away from Gui Si; if it is based on Chu's theory as Yiwei, then it is only less than three years. Shen and Wang Fangzhong are also friends. Even Shen has checked the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion and "there is no such couplet", which seems to be a surprising thing.</p>
<p>Recently, I accidentally discovered that this poem was actually seen in the Ming Dynasty opera novel Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool, which also narrates the story of Jiang Shilong. This poem is loaded in the Xingshu in the first chapter, which can be obtained at the beginning of the volume, but a few numbers have been changed slightly</p>
<p>"Meeting like duckweed from the ends of the earth, literature and martial arts are outstanding, but prosperity should not be extravagant. The enemy country has the heart to chase Ji Bu, but the humble home has no courage to be Zhu Jia. How can a dragon be a thing in a pond, and jewels will eventually become flowers on brocade. From here, where you hold hands with Yi, the Kuibi shines on Jianghua."</p>
<p>According to Zheng Zhenduo's Pinghua Collection of the Ming and Qing Dynasties and Sun Kaidi's Preface to the Chinese Novel Catalogue Seen in Tokyo, Japan, the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool can be found in the Xiu Gu Chun Rong and Guo Se Tian Xiang two books, which also collect the Legendary Romance and Milian Ji. Except for this, it seems that it has not been recorded. What I saw was the lithographic edition of Shanghai Jinji Bookstore in the 20th year of Guangxu, Collection of Talents, which is the seven kinds published under Guo Se Tian Xiang, with the same order of headings. The first article is this Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool. The narrated plot is mostly taken from the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion. Wang Ruilan is Huang Ruilan, and her father's name is Huang Fu (ancestor Huang Qianshan) Tuo Man Xingfu is Pu Lu Xingfu, Jiang and Huang are not Jin people, but Song people, and Xingfu is a Jin fugitive general. It begins by describing the conclusion with Jiang, based on the cited poem above. The following customs have added a lot of embellishments, focusing on poetry and prose, and some empty arguments, full of opera literature. "Orchid Gathering Dragon Pool" is because Shilong drew this picture to convey it to Ruilan and plan to reunite. The most exciting and touching Moon-Worshipping section in the opera was deleted, and replaced with the scene of Jiang and Huang worshiping the moon in the eastern courtyard during their journey, which is really buying sandalwood and returning the pearl. Among them, Shilong's discussion of Liyuan's acting section mentioned the Jinyin Bayi Ji, etc. The era of writing should not be too early, always at the time of Long and Wan. Now I know that the first edition of the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool, Xiu Gu Chun Rong, was carved during the Wanli period.</p>
<p>Now we can base on this and have the following possible explanations for the "anti-poetry" incident:</p>
<p>1. The original text of the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion should have no such poem. At that time, people because the two characters of legend contain two kinds of literary styles, and the narrative is the same as Jiang Shilong's story, without detailed examination, it was transmitted as Yougui Ji, and it is unknown? The certified Fang edition may be the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool. If the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion hated the implication, and the subsequent editions were deleted by the Fangjia, then in Shen's time, the old version should not have been without it either.</p>
<p>2. Shen's words "the resolver pretended to say this" may be close to the facts. Wu Yuan Cui was also a Wu native. At that time, the fellow villagers of Suzhou tried their best to run for this great prison, which is a very obvious fact. (Such as Wang Xideng, etc.) The Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool was specially made for this matter, so the opening is this poem, for fear that people will not see it, and to prove that it came from the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion in a far-fetched way. The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion has been passed down for a long time and is difficult to attribute to it; the two characters of legend can be borrowed appropriately. However, most people know less about the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool, and there is still no doubt that it is the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion opera. Shen's record may still be intentionally concealing this loophole, and the tone of the so-called "hating the implication and cutting out some sentence" is originally more focused on the resolver's statement of "is that so"</p>
<p>3. In the poetry, the characters of opera are changed from "Junshi" to "Chouguo", and "No way" is changed to "No courage". In terms of the meaning of the text, there are fewer words that are violated, and the meaning is more careful and prudent. (The nationality of Jiang and Huang, changing Jin to Song, and changing Xingmian to Jin fugitive general, may be due to the fact that it is cut from the two characters of "Chouguo".) Although it is said late, this series of texts should be completely consistent with the records of Shen, Tan, and Chu; but Shen Ji's "Zuo" is the word "Tuo", and the three articles also have small differences. The differences between the few characters may not cause the above inferences to be overturned.</p>
<p>4. If we say this, the poetry contained in the Record of the Orchid Gathering at the Dragon Pool is no different from that of Shen, Tan, and Chu. "Chouguo" and so on were changed due to fear of disaster after this incident occurred. Then the era of writing this opera should be advanced a little earlier. The second argument is close to conjecture, and the first explanation may still be applicable</p>
<p>5. The results of the few parties involved in this public case seem to have not been exempted from guilt. The argumentation of the resolver has not had much effect. The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion probably has no such poem at all, but it is a fact of decorating words and making suggestions, and the authorities have already understood it later?</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's article "A Brief Discussion on Novel Series" has been published. The two words "To be continued" at the end of the article were mistakenly arranged. I hereby correct it, hoping readers will pay attention.</p>

<p>— You Gong</p>
<p>The days passed by hurriedly, what remained in the mind was like yesterday, but, that has already been three years of time!</p>
<p>It was the hottest time of the Great Heat, perhaps the roads of the city were melting with oil, cicada-wing gauze clothing had long been draped over the shoulders, but, in this mountain hollow, those things were nowhere to be seen. The hot stone blocks of the mountain path turned up the heat, penetrating leather shoes, trampling the soles of feet soaked in sweat. The head wouldn't feel comfortable either, the sun stared with blood-red eyes, making everyone's body feel a little prickly, a hat as big as a bamboo basket covered the forehead, but, when you stood in the deep shade of a tree and took off your hat, a rush of heat would rise straight from the crown of your head.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, joy seized our hearts, we breathed a long sigh towards the blue sky with floating cotton clouds. We thought, your blood-red eyes will have no power to glare anymore, the fences you have woven, from today on, we will destroy them all.</p>
<p>Truly, this is a miracle, like discovering a large clear spring in a desolate desert, we have been traveling on the sweltering mountain roads for a full eight days since leaving the pier. Although "cars" are not considered rare, perhaps as common as crawling stinkbugs in the city, but, being surrounded by mountains, to actually see these clean Ford cars, the joy can be clearly seen on our faces.</p>
<p>As usual, we got up at "the rooster's crow to see the sky," washed our faces in a flurry, this time, there was no need to bind the sedan chairs, and the luggage was all moved and loaded onto the long-distance bus. I don't know why, there were so many people, surrounding the car in a circle, muttering, looking around, smiling, the expressions were very complicated, later, probably thinking that this was still not enough, so, some honked the horn in front of the car, some touched the lights in front of the car, and even more pressed the tires hidden underneath. Is it laughable? Perhaps, a mountain city that cannot see the material civilization of the metropolis, how could it not arouse their sense of novelty?</p>
<p>Rushing out of the city, driving towards the relatively wider road. The road was not very smooth, the stones buried underneath were looking up, naturally, the car refused to stop bouncing, although avoiding the direct attack of the blood-red eyes, but, the wooden benches inside the car, sitting for a long time will also make the buttocks burn. Moreover, you have to be careful of your head, arms, shoulders, if you are not careful, maybe the wooden wall of the car will kiss you, making you burn with an unnamed fire under the sweet kiss.</p>
<p>——Thirty for big stations, fifteen for small stations. The wrinkles on Zhang Futou's forehead were moving again and again.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Introducing "A Famous Artist" <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Turen</p>
<p>From the TASS news, I learned that the Soviet Union has been enthusiastically celebrating the fiftieth birthday of the genius playwright Belotserkovsky recently, and the chairman of the Central Committee of the country has decided to give him the honorary title of "Famous Artist." The name of this famous artist, as well as his masterpieces, are probably still very unfamiliar to readers in our country. Now, taking advantage of his fiftieth birthday, I will briefly introduce him with a few words, I hope readers will not blame me for being presumptuous.</p>
<p>Belotserkovsky worked as a sailor on Russian and English sailboats, as a factory worker on the European continent, as a farm laborer and a short-term worker in the Americas, and as a soldier in Siberia during the Russian Revolution. We can see his shadow in almost every upsurge of anger in Russia.</p>
<p>His plays reflect this very active and colorful life. "Response" describes how, during the period when Russia was subjected to armed intervention, American workers attempted to strike and refuse to transport munitions for the Allied countries. "The Moon Rises from the Left" is a love story during a turbulent period, famous for the line of the protagonist in the play: "Men and women who fall in love are counter-revolutionaries." "Storm" is his first revolutionary romance, and it is to show "the heroism of collective emotion." "Calm Waters" describes how the same characters in "Storm" continued to experience the New Economic Policy period. There are also many plays depicting sailors, plays depicting miners, and "Cage" cleverly depicts three eras of slavery: the black slaves on the coast of Africa that he saw from English sea vessels - almost like livestock; the serfs of old Russia; and the so-called modern slaves who unknowingly sold themselves - the cheapest slaves.</p>
<p>His early plays were all written for soldiers in Siberia. It was not until the performance of "Storm" in 1925 that he was called the first new playwright. He felt that the stage at that time was very conservative, and only entertained itself with classical heroes and bourgeois aesthetics. Artists and directors did not pay attention to new heroes; they did not come into contact with reality, and the characters in "Storm" were very novel and incredible to the actors at that time. When they first appeared on stage, it was as if elementary school students were reciting lessons they did not understand. However, the audience understood and cheered loudly, and at this time, the actors glimpsed the great significance of the "Storm" they were performing.</p>
<p>"Storm" is not only regarded as the first great Soviet tragedy, but also the most basic Soviet tragedy. It is a psychological study of the philosophical issues of life, death, and love. Through another lens of the microscope, the inner life of the creators of the new environment is examined. The love in the play arises naturally from the environment, and the sorrow is not the old-fashioned bourgeois hysteria. The new person feels in a new way, and this is not due to his nervous system, but to the basic position and the indomitable main action. All the characters are depicted as typical of their era in the sum of their lives. Everyone has his personal philosophy, but the personal philosophy is the representative of his collective philosophy.</p>
<p>"Storm" made Belotserkovsky a "Famous Artist." There is a special reason for this, and it is not accidental.</p>

<p>When I was fully awake, I was already lying on the sofa in the miller's house, the miller lived near the mill pond. Nali followed her mother home, her mother also came out of the city that day. Christopher stayed here, the miller's wife taught him, and he was busy putting damp bandages on my head. When I opened my eyes, he was sitting on a chair next to me, with a basin of water placed between his knees. He was about to change the bandage; but he now pulled his hand back, and he asked me timidly, "Can I help you, Philip?"</p>
<p>I sat up, trying to put my thoughts together, my head was aching badly. "No," I said after a while, "I don't need you to help."</p>
<p>"Shall I call someone from the city to come here?"</p>
<p>"You go; I can walk home myself."</p>
<p>Christopher hesitated and stood up, putting the basin on the table.</p>
<p>Soon after, the door of the room echoed, he grabbed the doorknob, but he didn't leave. When I turned back to look, I saw my old friend's eyes with an expression of sincere sorrow looking at me.</p>
<p>I still hesitated for a second. "Christopher," I said, stood up and held out my hand to him, "If you have free time, then please stay a little longer, you can take my arm to support me, and we will walk back to the city together."</p>
<p>His face shone with joy. He grabbed my hand and shook it. "That punch was too heavy, Philip!" he said.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Reviving the Nation and Transforming the People <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Our nation has long been known as the "sick man of East Asia," which is a great shame! Now, Mr. Chen Lifu, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and Mr. Yu Youren, in view of the weakness and decline of the entire nation's physiology and behavior, in order to revive the nation, have initiated and organized a National Transformation Society to study the nation's pathological conditions and seek transformation strategies. They are now actively preparing and have issued an organizational declaration and transformation plan. In the declaration, it is pointed out that the physiological state of our nation is a group of people with a hundred diseases. Such as hunchbacks and shrugged shoulders, weak spirits, many sickly and deformed conditions, a frowning and pale complexion, slow movements, lack of work intensity, withered and lifeless, old and decrepit, men lack the air of beards and eyebrows, and women still have a worried and sickly appearance. Throughout the country, regardless of wisdom or foolishness, none are free from a dull and lifeless atmosphere. As for behavioral pathologies, they include starting strong but finishing weakly, enthusiasm only five minutes, perfunctory, hypocritical, and unity seeming like loose sand, with vision as small as a grain of sand. The plan they have formulated is for the government to concentrate the strength of the entire nation to seek the construction of the north, striving to achieve the goal of prosperity. At the same time, the government should gradually develop the north and attract back the excellent people who have migrated south. Furthermore, scientific methods should be used to implement marriage control. Other methods, such as food, disease, and other methods to save physical and mental health, should also be scientifically controlled.</p>
<p>To strengthen a country, one must first strengthen its people. Without a strong nation, hoping for a prosperous country is nothing but a fool's dream. The weakness and decline of our entire nation is an undeniable phenomenon. The solution must start with transforming the people, and with the united efforts of the whole country in all aspects, we must ensure that our 400 million people achieve balanced intellectual and physical development. When the voice of national revival spreads throughout the country, the organization of this National Transformation Society by our country's intellectuals is truly something for the people to celebrate!</p>
<p>However, today, talking about reviving the nation and transforming the people, although urgent, the work of transforming the people is very difficult. Because the weakness and decline of our nation has been going on for a long time, to transform it cannot be achieved in a day or two. It is necessary for the entire country to devote all its efforts to hope for success. In my personal opinion, transforming the people should start from two aspects. One aspect is the transformation of the national spirit, transforming the negative, corrupt, conservative, superstitious, timid, selfish, narrow-minded, and regressive spirit of our nation into a positive, fresh, trendy, scientific, courageous, generous, and progressive spirit. The most powerful and effective method of transforming the spirit is education. I hope that those engaged in education will pay attention to this and take on the responsibility of transforming the nation!</p>
<p>The other aspect is the transformation of physical fitness. The weakness of our nation's physical fitness, like the decline of our spirit, has almost become incurable, truly a group of people with a hundred diseases. If we do not seek to transform this national physical fitness early, even if others do not destroy us in the future, we will destroy ourselves! And a sound mind resides in a sound body. Without transforming physical fitness, hoping for a sound spirit is impossible. Therefore, transforming physical fitness is more important than transforming the spirit. But how to transform physical fitness? The most important thing is to promote physical education. We must enable people throughout the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, farmers, workers, merchants, or soldiers, to practice beneficial exercises to forge their physical fitness and become a physically strong nation. Secondly, the selection of spouses and the birth of children should also be carefully considered. As for daily life, diet, hygiene, diseases, etc., we must pay full attention to them. These are also very important to the physical fitness of the nation.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the nation depends on this one action. May our people rise up and devote themselves to the transformation of the nation!</p>
<h3 id="e231">A Record of Welcome Rain <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Last year's great drought dealt a great blow to the countryside, but there was no snow in winter, and not much rain in spring; all the way to Grain Full, the heavens were still dry and did not send down water. The fields were as dry as red soil, the ponds only had bottom water left, and the silt and beaches of the riverbanks all appeared on the surface to compete with the scorching sun, even the few deeper canals only had a thin layer of melon peel water. So the farmers felt a dreaded horror in their hearts, a second drought was about to come!</p>
<p>Time passed with the rise and fall of the thermometer, and in the blink of an eye, Grain in Ear had passed, and the high and low fields should have been preparing for transplanting rice seedlings; but in many places, the fields were plowed roughly, but the soil was as hard as iron, and there was no ankle-deep water in the field ditches. If the sky didn't send down some water, then how could the seedlings be transplanted? If we waited another ten days or so, the time for transplanting seedlings would pass, and then even if water came, it would be too late; if this continued, could this year's drought be avoided?</p>
<p>In a few places near rivers and canals with water, water was being pumped day and night, but those dry and cursed fields could only stare at the sky with wide eyes, with seedlings but no place to plant them, but the lowland fields were not good either, planting Indica rice would mean fearing that the sky would not rain, so it would still be a dry death, if planting late rice, then when the autumn began, it would be pouring with reverse plum rain, inevitably being flooded, so this year the high fields were not good, and the low fields were also annoying, truly making the farmers anxious and unable to think of a solution. Especially Desheng's father at the head of Wu Village, these days he has been restless like an ant on a hot pot, and now, in the name of the village elder, he has convened an emergency meeting in the Shen family ancestral hall:</p>
<p>"If the sky continues to be so dry, we will definitely not be able to plant our seedlings this year; we have already suffered a drought last year, and if we have another year like that this year, then can we common people bear it? Now is the time to plant seedlings but no water comes, what use will it be if it comes later? I think now that time is urgent, we should immediately notify the village tomorrow to first abstain from killing livestock, and if it doesn't rain again in a week, we will have to trouble the Five Saints God and ask him to come out to pray for rain." Desheng's father sat at the head of the table and expressed his opinion, then knocked out the ashes from his pipe, took a sip of tea to moisten his throat, and asked everyone again: "What do you all think?"</p>
<p>Their meeting didn't have any formalities, they just put two square tables together in the dining hall of the ancestral hall, placed more than ten benches around, and had a pot of tea and a few packs of old yellow cigarettes prepared, and everyone sat there in a chaotic manner to discuss.</p>
<p>After Desheng's father finished speaking, he used a pair of bright eyes to sweep over everyone's faces.</p>
<p>"Yes, what the old man said is right, we should first abstain from killing livestock starting tomorrow." Everyone answered in unison.</p>
<p>"Ah! I have lived for more than fifty years, and I have never encountered such a year, if the people don't do evil, how can the heavens send down so many disasters?" Desheng's father stood up, walked out of the circle of conversation, and sighed like this.</p>
<p>But when they dispersed from the meeting and were about to walk out of the ancestral hall door, dark clouds had already gathered in the sky.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>. Before they had returned home, copper coin-sized raindrops had already hit the earth; in less than an hour, several ditches were gurgling with rapid streams, and an inch of water had accumulated in the fields.</p>
<p>The rain didn't stop all day, and it continued until the morning of the next day. The villagers, with pale faces, all showed a layer of gratified smiles. At this time, everyone put on bamboo hats, draped on straw raincoats, and went to work in the fields—transplanting seedlings.</p>
<p>"This rain, although not very heavy, is already our life-saving water, as long as it can rain again in a few days, and continue like this, then there is hope!" Desheng's father finished transplanting the seedlings, walked out of the field, and when he sat on the field ridge to rest, he smoked his pipe while looking at the sky and saying.</p>
<p>"Yes! We always need the help of the Heaven God, only then will we poor people have a life!" Little Tou San lazily stood up from the ground, stretched, and felt that the field work these days was too heavy, so his limbs were as tired as if they were paralyzed, but his spirit was excited.</p>
<p>Half a month later, a large area of fields near Wu Village Head was covered with lush green rice seedlings, swaying happily in the wind under the drizzle or sunny days.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Fleeing the Famine <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>Here, in the advent of the Plum Rain season, a flood broke out, and it was only with great difficulty that it receded not long after; thus, the nourishment for sustaining life here was completely devoured, leaving behind some people, some people as hungry as ghosts.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the mud was swollen like cotton, gnawing at people's toes, the tree trunks were also covered with mud, and the fields had lost their traces. Truly, a small and densely populated village ten days ago is now as desolate as a withered temple, no, a vast desert.</p>
<p>Night gradually eroded the light; the wounded village could not find a trace of light. Everyone, with empty stomachs, cursed their fate in the dark territory. The sky and the sky ten days ago had not changed, still the same bright moon, still the same twinkling stars; but, in this group of poor lives, they felt a world of difference from ten days ago. They didn't understand what kind of evil people were committing this year? The suffering in the world was already felt to be unbearable, and with such an incurable natural disaster, it symbolized the descent of the end and the premonition of the extinction of life!</p>
<p>So, everyone held such a terrifying soul.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was the scorching summer, and sleeping in the open air at night didn't feel very cold. Coupled with everyone's enthusiasm, they didn't feel lonely. When the food was cut off, everyone asked the famous wise man—Chen Laoguan. In such a mood, Chen Laoguan could no longer think of a solution: "Ah! What about the food in the future?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Such a big group of people!" Ah Gui's father added.</p>
<p>You looked at me, I looked at you, everyone couldn't think of any clues. Finally, it was the teacher Wang who said such a passage: "Isn't waiting for death here staring at the mud? The only way is to go to the provincial capital."</p>
<p>"That's right, what teacher Wang said is right." Chen Laoguan said.</p>
<p>"Then, without delay, let's leave early tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>"Okay, let's leave tomorrow." Everyone said so.</p>
<p>The stars twinkled, as if mocking.</p>
<p>The night was further stripped away, and it was almost impossible to see even the faces of people a foot away. After a compromised decision, everyone tightened their belts, hid an empty stomach, and wearily lay across the only remaining broken mats to pass the night.</p>
<p>Quietly, occasionally a weak dog barked in the distance, which would make these frightened people open their tired eyes. To see if there were any changes.</p>
<p>The children cried out in hoarse little throats because they had no milk to eat: the women sang sad lullabies, and the men sighed. In peacetime, they would have been asleep in dreamland. But today, for some reason, they didn't even have the mood to doze off. Cries, lullabies, sighs, as well as the light barks of dogs and the calls of night owls, harmonized into (the most famous sad song in the world.</p>
<p>The night was spent in a bleak atmosphere.</p>
<p>The next day, in the early morning when the stars had not yet disappeared, the sky was still stained with a dark gray hue. The impatient Huang Dasao shouted: "It's not early! We should get up and prepare our things, and hurry to the provincial capital!"</p>
<p>Without nostalgia, without sadness, everyone got up in a swarm, and packed some broken things. The men put the children in baskets and carried them on poles, the women carried some broken cloth clothes and cotton wool on their backs, and the elderly supported their weak bodies and stepped step by step on the way to their future.</p>
<p>The sun rose, willfully inflicting a severe torture on everything of the people, the fire also seemed to burn out sweat drops on people's backs. The earth was like being poured with boiling water, so hot that it hurt the soles of their feet. Two</p>
<p>A skinny dog, stretched out its tongue tip, greedily lowered its head and kissed the ground.</p>

<h3 id="e238">A Casual Discussion on "Autumn Fan Lamp Light" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>"Autumn Fan Lamp Light" adopts extremely realistic themes to depict the social pathology—the problem born from the interweaving of feudalism and new romantic ideas.</p>
<p>The playwright Tan Youliu does not just sympathize with those who are sacrificed under social pathology, but also strongly points out the reactions that these people should have after being stimulated by social pathology.</p>
<p>A purely feudal father, a daughter endowed with the ability to scout out the opposite sex and infected with new ideas, and a self-abandoning youth, and a woman who lives a distorted life without realizing it, perform the tragedy of temptation, abandonment, and depravity that society has seen.</p>
<p>"Autumn Fan Lamp Light" not only thoroughly reveals the development and end of this tragedy, but more valuable is that it portrays the resurrection process of the protagonists of this tragedy and the motivation for seeking rebirth.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu used special techniques, calmly describing the story, and clearly organizing the pictures, which strengthened the central structure of "Autumn Fan Lamp Light", and loudly appealed to people who were lost, pointing out the path to light.</p>
<p>A person's life is dead, there is no possibility of resurrection, a person's soul has fallen, there is a chance of rebirth, and a strong will can break social discrimination and strengthen the self-confidence of those who seek rebirth.</p>
<p>Li Lili has always played cheerful and lively roles in her plays. In "Autumn Fan Lamp Light", she has to play a sad, melancholy, dignified play, which is completely different from before. Her success in this change of style determines that she is a multifaceted role.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, a new star who has already attracted special attention, "Autumn Fan Lamp Light" is her first leading role in the film industry. Her unique talent and unique acting skills have not only won this special opportunity, but also won special success to satisfy the audience's hopes and high demands.</p>
<p>Shang Guanwu played the traitor Hu Fu in "The Road" and the lecherous gentry He Renzhai in "Fisherman's Song". In the future "Tian Lun", he also plays another different role, none of which are not well-acted. In "Autumn Fan Lamp Light", he plays a rigid feudal father, and his acting skills have developed to a new path.</p>
<p>Gu Menghu, who won praise in "New Woman", plays one of the protagonists, the depraved youth, and Huang Yunzhen also plays the type of role she specializes in, which are undoubtedly satisfying to the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, the success of a film is not only determined by the success of the screenwriter, director and leading actors, but also by the help of other aspects.</p>

<p>— Gu Ying</p>
<p>Timber imports increased by 4 million in the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year. Cement imports have only remained at one-fifth of what they were three years ago since the implementation of the new tax.</p>
<p>2.  Timber</p>
<p>Chinese domestic timber is called Guang timber, Xi timber, Jian timber, Hang timber, etc. Guang timber has the richest production, originating in northern Guangxi, eastern Guizhou, and between the Five Ridges and Hengshan Mountains of Hunan. Because its reserves are the deepest, its annual output is the most abundant. Next are Xi timber, Jian timber, and Hang timber, etc., whose annual output is similar. Xi timber is produced in the Shanling and Jiulian Mountains in Jiangxi. Due to the constant entry and exit of the communists and the continuous warfare, there is a lack of cultivation, and production has sharply decreased. Jian timber is produced in Jianning, Jianou, etc. in Fujian. Its production is mostly in sections, such as the double, half, barrel, and single wood sold in this city. Hang timber is produced in various counties in western Zhejiang, coming out along the Qujiang and Huijiang rivers, and gathering in Hangzhou (hence the name). However, the properties of the timber produced in the two rivers are different. The timber produced in the Qujiang area is naturally old, gentle, and hard. The timber produced in the Huijiang area is easily grown through artificial cultivation, and the output is more abundant, but its nature is loose and tender, far less than that produced in the Qujiang area. Those who operate in this industry flourished most in 1925 and 1926. The annual sales in this city were always as high as 30 to 40 million yuan. Recently, because town architecture has trended towards Europeanization to reduce pillars, long materials are needed, so Chinese people are happy to use foreign timber, because Chinese timber is not as large as foreign timber. Therefore, except for rural architecture and small buildings using Chinese timber, such as the tall buildings in towns and the sleepers used on railways, there is no one that does not use foreign pine. The sales of Chinese timber have sharply decreased, and the import of foreign timber has increased year by year. According to customs reports, the import of timber from January to April this year reached 9,218,775 customs gold units, equivalent to 15,883,949 national currency units. Compared with 5,020,597 customs gold units in the same period last year, it increased by 83% in terms of customs gold. If compared with the import volume of 4,894,622 customs gold units in the same period in 1933, the import volume in the same period of 1936 increased by 90%. A table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e242">The Magnificent Appearance of the New Welfare Company Building <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<h3 id="e243">General Overview of the New Welfare Company Building <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Welfare Company is one of the famous department stores at sea. It has been established for many years and has developed its business and enjoys a good reputation. Now, in order to expand its business, the company has built a new building at 190-208 Jing'an Temple Road, which has been completed and moved in. It will open for business on Wednesday, July 3rd. Here is a brief description of the new building! The new Welfare building is located near the International Hotel and the Grand Bright Cinema, directly opposite the Racecourse. The location is suitable, and the architecture is beautiful. From the perspective of buyers, it is truly a magnificent department store. The Welfare Company's own buildings include the ground floor, the second floor, and the third floor. The upper two floors are new-style apartments. The internal location of the new building needs to be expanded as much as possible, and at the same time, it is necessary to avoid using too many pillars. Therefore, the architects, Cass 洋行, and their engineer, Mr. Bao Lisu Lebosiji, have put a lot of effort into this. After using arches with a span of 75 feet to support these two floors of apartments, the fourth floor can be absolutely pillar-free. According to the 6,000 to 7,000 square feet location, but can not use pillars, this is still a new idea in Shanghai. The arch with a span of 75 feet to support the building, is not common. The towering part of the façade of the new building is equipped with neon lights by Li'an Electric Company, which shines brightly at night, adding to the spectacle. The new building was built by Senji Construction Factory, the elevator was installed by Xiangtai, the plumbing and heating equipment were contracted by Maoli, and the lighting equipment was contracted by Shenchang 洋行. It is also heard that in order to facilitate customers, the company has not only hired many Chinese assistants to serve sincerely, but also set up a parking lot near the company for customers to park their vehicles at any time. The parking lot is located next to the small vegetable market in the Racecourse. Cars can be driven in from Jing'an Temple Road and Baker Road. The distance between the field and the new Welfare building is only a short distance, and when vehicles are parked there, there are guards on duty to watch closely, so it can be guaranteed that there will be no obstacles.</p>
<p>Notice To Mr. Xiao Ang · Xihao · Mei Zhenhuan · Gu Ying · Zhu Zhenmu · Dao · Liu Zhongchao · Qin · I am very grateful for your submission in June. The fee has now been settled. Please collect it at the accounting office from the 6th to the 10th of this month, and from the 16th to the 20th, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day (excluding Sundays).

<h3 id="e244">The Design of the Latest American Theaters (Middle) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Original by B. A. Hueton, Translated by Xiao Ang</p>
<p>(II) Selection of Architectural Style</p>
<p>The form of the theater is closely related to the business. If the form is exquisite, it can attract the attention of pedestrians and be beautiful, and the business will definitely be prosperous. But the theater is a place for high-end entertainment, so it must be very magnificent and elegant. Russian theaters noticed this point very early. This time, Mr. Hueton introduced this style to the United States.</p>
<p>(III) Internal Design</p>
<p>(A) Lounge. Before the movie starts, there must be many viewers waiting in front of the door, so the lounge is indispensable. The equipment here may be a little luxurious, and the furnishings may be a little noble. There are sofas, coffee points, and toilets. In short, it is necessary to prevent the audience from feeling the wait. The place here can be larger, able to accommodate one-third of the audience. There is heating in winter and electric fans in summer. At the same time, very beautiful photos of stars and very moving advertisements can be hung on the walls. These are closely related to the business and must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(B) Line of Sight. The most important thing in the design of the theater is the line of sight. Whether upstairs, downstairs, or in the corners, you must be able to see clearly. This is a very difficult problem to solve. Mr. Haueton can use his genius to change the shape of the theater into a particularly suitable oval shape according to the principles of optics. The focal point of the movie machine is at this end, and the focal point of the screen is at that end. In this way, the light is reflected out, and the audience in the four seats feels particularly clear and comfortable. This is his amazing discovery and creation.</p>
<p>(C) Sound Waves - The second most important thing is sound waves. Now that sound movies have been invented, the sound must be particularly clear and pleasant. There must be echoes to increase the sound, and at the same time, there must be sound-absorbing materials to make the sound even. Mr. Haoton's use of the focal point's position has resulted in a particularly good sound, which can be said to be an extraordinary success.</p>
