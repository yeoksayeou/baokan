<h3>墨索里尼壻子率空軍　掩護意軍攻入阿境</h3>
<p>阿比西尼亞請國聯保護　意國電吿謂係警戒步驟　國聯行政院明日開會</p>
<p>（倫敦）阿比西尼亞之戰爭、業己發作，戰事刻在兩處進行，一在北部意屬索瑪里邊界之達那基爾省、一在東南昆連意屬索瑪里之沃迦登省、意軍先以飛機猛轟阿國極北之阿杜華鎭、繼以步兵進攻、詳情未悉、惟據此間所接之消息稱，雙方死傷甚衆云（三日格透電）</p>
<p>阿斯馬拉　意軍今晨已開始攻入阿境、取攻勢之意軍係如預料自愛立特里邊境直趨阿杜華、按阿杜華為一八九六年意軍敗績之處、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）巴黎晚報登載駐阿比西尼亞京城特派員電訊、謂本日佔據阿國穆薩亞里地方之意大利軍隊、約計二萬人、分為三縱隊前進、意軍與駐防該地之唐拿凱部落戰士、當卽發生衝突、死亡人數未悉、但意軍與阿國正式軍隊、則尙未接觸、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）阿比西尼亞今日向國聯通吿意軍開釁、意政府亦卽電告國聯、稱阿比西尼亞之總動員使意軍在東非不得不取「非常步驟」、阿皇向國聯之正式文吿、抗議意軍飛機轟炸阿杜華、及意軍進攻、致弁該處近郊發生激戰、生命財產損失甚巨、意國文吿則稱、阿比西尼亞之總動員使東菲意軍總部不得不佔據數處軍事要邑、以資警戒、國聯行政院已决定於星期六召集會議、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意國駐英大使格蘭第本日經由外交部通吿英國政府、謂東菲愛立特里亞意國殖民地軍事當局、因阿比西尼亞某某地點具有軍略關係業經决定佔領、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）今日此間發表公報、謂已訓令東菲意軍總司令為安全起見、進佔現有陣綫外之某某地點、並指阿國總動員令實為阿國領袖又已要求開戰者好戰精神之表現、意國政府又發表一文、言阿國向國聯抗議意空軍轟炸事、係舊式為人濫用之技倆、含有預作將來張本之性質云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外傳意軍已侵入阿國阿杜華地方之說、頃由官方加以否認謂東菲洲正式戰事、現尙未開始、至聆意軍佔據穆薩亞里地方之消息、則官方未加徵實、亦未否認、僅謂該處意阿疆界、本未劃定、意軍的前推進以諜改善其防禦形勢、則當屬可能云、（一一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯施行制裁　日表示不參加</h3>
<p>惟守口立態度</p>
<p>（東京）意軍進攻阿國之消息、至三日正午外務省未接確報、緣聞外務省對於意阿戰爭之態度如次、意大利進攻阿國不可避免、阿國對此聲明意軍侵略、提訴國聯、日政府對此爭執當守中立態度、國聯如發動會章第十六條、日本因非國聯會員國、並無任何義務與責任（三日日聯</p>

<p>法國托魯斯　今日有員國靑年奉總動員令乘火車返國服務、臨行時車站羣衆高呼打倒墨索里尼及反對戰爭之口號、當地居民旣聞意人五十名奉命歸國從戎之消息後、卽擁入車站、擬阻意人出發、大批警察趕來彈壓、致起衝突、結果多人受傷、但不嚴重、意頒署官員一人經警察保護後、始得無事、聞托魯斯區內意籍人民接到回國服務之命令者、約有四千人、迄目前止、遵命返國者僅有五十人、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日有羣眾在通衢示威、大呼「甲立」及「打倒戰爭、」警察已將羣衆驅散、並捕獲頒袖十四人、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>香港美商銀行　三十萬元運往紐約</h3>

<h3>世界動物節</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>今日為世界動物節歐美各國對此均有盛大之紀念輿論為充分之宣傳名流作公開之演講此外並有利用播音以闡明保動之意義者有規定敎課以提撕學童之耳目者至於個人表曝尤復更僕難數本埠之中國保護動物會亦決定於是日舉行宣傳大會以期與世界相適應體上天好生之德為勝殘去殺之圖仁人君子之用心固有値得贊嘆者矣</p>
<p>保護動物運動肇端遠在百年以前彼時英國虐待牲畜之事頗見流行在敎會掩護之下乃有保動會之組織顧植根未堅響應猶鮮直至一八三五年得維多利亞女王有力之贊助並由國會通過保護一切家畜之法律該會方得慶前途之順利奠基礎於永久迄乎今日保動為習熟之名詞空氣久瀰漫於世界德法美意奧比捷丹芬荷諸國已莫不有保護動物之機關而我國保護動物會亦於去年二月在滬成立追踪步武共襄襄舉一年來之成績亦已妁然可覩如舉辦放生園聘用獸醫如遷養邑廟九曲橋下之水畜如函請浙省府制止各縣捕殺野犬如貢獻主張於工部局重中殘害動物之禁令皆能就事實所指陳為急　之匡維其胞與物懷之念寗徒託空言可比吾人於此有不願寄與深切之同情者乎</p>
<p>或者以為世界殺機巳萌大戰序幕將揭人類自相殘害之不暇復何有於牲畜之保護且卽就非道處置而言人羣所遭受者殆亦遠在牲畜之上安得妥籌周全之術以使此滅絕人道之殘賊行為不復重見於今日之世界乎殊不知保護動物為常人勢力所易直及遏止殘殺非單純行動可得奏效吾人亦祇能就其卑近易為者而置力焉冀藉不斷宣傳之力量稍泯無端虐殺之跡象更欲基此保護動物之一念以漸博致人類　濡之同悄庶幾潛移默化互思愛助由是而自動戢其殘害之行為放棄戰爭之惡念則今日保護動物云者推其意義所暨固未嘗不足以達維護人羣之終極目的也</p>

<p>（南京）蘇北水禍近益慘重、各縣紛請導淮會拆除束水壩、須愷二日發表談話、略謂中運河劉老澗束水壩之築造係根據經委會防黃會決議、卽導南注微湖黃水經中運河六塘河入海、近經詳測出六塘者每秒流量約八百立方公尺、而經劉老澗束水壩南下運河者、亦達五百立方公尺、束水壩上下游水位相約十八公分影響六塘中運之流量甚微、本與蘇省府現正請示經委會辦理，惟細經研究、六塘中運為目前排洩黃水唯一出路、現黃河口門未堵、積水旣多、來量又湧、遠過流屯積、水位日高、乃使災區擴大，實際上束水壩並無若何關係、（三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>十三國委員會開會　討論制裁問題　研究步驟交行政院決定　英擬用力迅速終止戰事　法國仍不放棄和緩行動</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政　意阿爭端十三國不員會定於午後四時舉行會議、主席西班牙代表瑪達里亞伽、屆時當討論制裁問題、緣東菲方面戰事卽已開始、則國聯會是否依據盟約第十六條立卽施行制裁或依照原來所採用之程序、仍由十三國委員會依據盟約第十五條、起草報吿與建議、自當加以考慮、因而十三國委員會對於意軍侵入阿國之舉是否　成「未經挑釁之侵略」可否援用盟約第十六條宣佈制裁辦法、必須加以討論、一俟星期六日行政院舉行會議時、則十三國委員會任務卽吿結束、此後究應採取何項步驟、當由行政院自行決定、至阿國皇帝所請派遣調查團一節、英法西三國專家、當向十三國委員會提出報吿書、以為阿國邊境旣已發生戰事、則派遣調查期之　卽屬徒勞無益、而又具有危險性質云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）阿皇咋致國聯貢意國侵犯阿國邊界之電文傳到後、卽分送國聯行政院各理事、行政院似將於日內集議、行政院今可隨時召集、蓋今日集議之十三國委員會、除意外阿行政完全體會議、惟意代表團今幾全在羅馬、僅留微職之員數人於日內瓦、與國聯有關之各界現不信墨索里尼已作最後決議第阿傳來之意軍犯界悄息及羅馬昨日試騐總動員之舉皆令此間大為震驚、惟意人方面以為意軍之行動、並非表示戰爭已開始不過移向險要陣地耳、行政院或將立卽決議作天空視察之佈置、俾偵明意軍是否已在阿國東北隅沃薩省茅薩阿里山境侵越阿國邊界、如確有犯界情事、則行政院卽將開會、而國聯大會或亦將重行召集、　日內瓦所接獨立方面消息、確有意軍約五萬人攜飛機集於茅薩阿里山境、其地界線微覺含糊、故目前尚不能斷定意軍確已開入阿國境內云、今日十三國委員會集議時、將討論阿皇申請國聯派視察員實地巡察之建議、同時墨索里尼昨在羅馬所發之演說、此間人士目為已使和平希望餘留甚微、許多觀察家以為此乃實行動作前之最後宣言、某評論家且稱之為「戰爭之演說」（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國反對意國　武之態度、今日益形强硬、接近鮑爾溫首相者稱、首相對於意相墨索里尼之演說、將於星期四在本冒茲地方保守黨大會中演說時答覆之、此間且謂、墨氏之演說已使英國內閣決意遏阻彼之野心、並以集體制裁之方法、迅速終止此次爭端云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國規已準備實踐對意施行制裁之諾言、惟以他國合作為條件、今日內閣會議之前、外相霍爾及陸相哈禮發晋謁英皇、會議之後、陸相與海軍大臣孟賽爾及空軍大臣雷斯德復會議一切、足見英國已實行日已經宣布之政策、據悉內閣曾討諭應否向戰德兩國探詢其對於國聯對意制裁之態度、探詢之問題將包括下列三點、（一）訓令艾登大臣在國聯愼重聲明英國不　單獨行動、（二）切意國確為戎首則對可撤消軍火禁令、（三）英法合作、應付歐洲危機、（二日國民電）</p>

<h3>評閻錫山氏之土地村有</h3>
<p>— 錚</p>
<p>閻錫山氏鑒於赤禍蔓延、慨然發表根本防共之方案、主張土地村有、其認識與勇氣、殊足令吾人欽佩，蓋近數年來、中樞當局、社會人士、雖　曾表示防共須着力於澄淸政治及經濟改造、然迄未敢有昭明張著之改革方案、更未敢顯言現下土地問題、為共禍所以披猖之主因、而閻氏今以地方當局之身份由積年從政之所得、能認識問題之癥結、表示其根本改變現社會機構及經濟基礎組織之主張、其明决殊令人驚嘆、</p>
<p>然閻氏之主張原則及辦法大總、吾人就科學之立塲、殊不敢謬然附和、</p>
<p>閻氏主張之土地村有、實類於我國北魏隋唐時之均田及口分制、與夫日本大化革新後之研田制、此制在土地廣漠人口稀少之純　業社會、亦頗有存在之價值、蓋頗能破不平之限界收均富之效、然吾國古代之均附口分制、及日本之班田制之所以終至於崩潰者、實以人與地之調和至難、管理支配之芋續過繁、而近代較進步之農業經營、較繁複之社會組織有不容其存在故也、閻氏忘忽歷史事實、於今日尙倡此種中古時代之辦法、雖其立意未可厚非、而終未足以為適於吾國今日之土地政策也、</p>
<p>就閻氏之土地村有辦法大綱觀之、其主旨可分為下列五點、（一）土地以公債收歸村有、（二）就土地之性質、劃分為各種單位面積分給農民耕作、（三）農民在耕作年齡之起訖時、受田還田、（四）以移民調劑寬鄉狹鄉、（五）以各種直接稅價還收買土地之公債、今請就此五點、分別論述之、</p>
<p>（一）土地以如何方法收歸村有、今姑勿論、而土地村有與私有之利弊如何殊有論列之價值、至原始社會、無論中外、土地均屬之於血緣集團之村、而降至今日、無論中外、土地上均不能不產生私有制度者、蓋以人類之習性與社會之機構使之不能不若是也、人類雖為動物之靈、然究屬動物之一、動物之自私心、人類迄今未曾消失也、自私心之正常發展、即為在一不妨礙他人之生存一之條件下、求本不生存之充份適竟愉快、生命力之盡量發揮延續、因此人類始存文明、始有社會、切文明之耙原、不能不謂於基於人類自我的觀念之發屐、故舉者　謂所有權觀念為人類社會之絕大發明、蓋因有所有權觀怠、於是始有經　觀念、人類因此始能動勤懇懇、胼手胝足以求其生業、一人之力不足、併家族之力為之、身之力不足、併若了若孫之力為之、於是人類日益繁殖·富厚·人類之社會、始能存在發達、而私有觀念之所以為　詬病者、乃在發展過度、終至因私害公、因一人之利而害衆人之生耳、倘能改正　公之私、以較完善周密少制度、防範其流弊、則吾可决然論斷、在今日之文明程　下、私有勝於公有也、此論在他方面為然、在土地制度方面、更有其不可顚撲之眞理、蓋土地之天然習性、須人類汁血之培護、始能發揚光大、人類對土地之用情愈專、愛護愈力、則其生產能力愈當厚、切集約經營、均起於小農自耕制、而游牧制及大地主制，或不良之佃耕制、結果使土地與人之關係薄弱、愛情不富、土地之生產力即顯然降低、今日一般所倡導之集國經營、其在經營校術上、雖有深厚之依據，而終難望普遍者、即在人與土地之愛力，不若　制　之深厚、故在土地經營上言、村有之意識、終不敵私有之意識較為有利也、</p>
<p>近代土地之本性、已行金融資本化、交換貿易、贈遺織承均可以一種單位、代表其價值、此種土地價格之成立、為近代村落經濟進化成為國民經濟之主因、凡土地之固有性能、及人類對之所投施之勞力資本、均可以全國一致之貨幣單位表出之、因之土地具有一般經濟性、人類可各別依其生活需　及耕作能力、隨時增减其所有之土地、今觀閻氏之辦法、土地雖仍付之私營、而倡　為村有、則土地顯須禁止買賣交易、則不徒土地之經濟性全失、人民不得隨其所需而支配之、結　、正所謂以人殉地、以地　絆人之生、中古之　奴制、行見復活、姑無論非近今經濟制度之所能容、凡亦非　今人類社會事實上之所許可也、目人類之生死靡定、聚散無常耕作能力、因老少疾病而有差異、如何能使繼續增加之人口、均得應有之土地、如何取有餘以補不足、使耕作能力與土地多寡相適應、均為事實之所大難唐之口分田、日本之班田、不能禁止人民私相受授買賣結果、仍行回復私有、此即為其主因、故以國有而行國營、效法蘇俄、雖失去土地　本化之利、然尙可强行其說、今欲言村有而付之私營、則决為悖反事理之說也、此就土地經濟上言、村有不敵完善之私有制也、</p>
<p>其他如村之單位之不穩定、村有管理上之困難、以尺公債收買方法之流弊滋多、尙屬問題之末節、句捨而勿論也、</p>
<p>（二）閻氏之理想、以為土地可就各種之素質、依一人之耕作力、而劃分成為單位、而關氏不知土地之水早肥瘠、參差至烈、而一人之耕件力、亦至難佔計也、　閻氏之意、介若大體上求一計算方法、而不求其真確公平也、然此烏足以言國家政策、凡　　立法、必求其精到平準、然後天下帖服、而吏胥無從操縱舞者、如立法之本身、將已不平、則勢之所趨、必至天下騷然、目閻氏亦如村與村間、因範圍大小、人口多寡、土地肥　、而將發生極大之差異、乃强為解辭曰、「人之求生、如水之就下，村界雖有一定、而人之居住遷徒、原屬自由、一為一定、一為活動、縱有不平、自能趨於平也、嗚呼，此論烏足服天十、使村民之信可自由　移以求生、則天下土地肥沃、交通　便、生產富、之區、將羣趨若騖、禍亂之生、將不旋踵、使村民而安土　遷、寗願老死鄉里、强求於生長之區、得一口分、閻氏又將何法驅之如水之就下、如人民　能如水之就下、自趨於平、則行均田制時、賓鄕狹鄉之說不生、寬鄕倍田、狹鄕减半之事、當不致見之載籍矣、　此議不僅單位分歧、初分配時之為　特甚，即偶或行之、亦必流弊百出、不平益烈終咯於自然廢止之運命也、</p>
<p>（三）受田還田、其精神上之缺陷即為私有意識不確立使人民對土地愛力薄弱、經營不專、生產降低、已如上述、而事實上之困難則為受還之手續、至為紛煩、戶籍失　、奸欺即生，蓋人有生死鯊移戶有嫁娶分合、今妙計口而授田、計年齡而定受還、則古時團貌制度、巳見其窮、現時保甲制度、亦未足用、必也歐洲之人事登記制、能厲行於窮鄕僻壤、始可實現受還之法、然此僅其端耳人口生殖益繁、田之還者少、而人之待授田者多、又將如何、閻氏之救濟辦法、謂村公所可按人口增加情形、重行劃分、而不知全部重行劃分之糾紛、又將伊於何底、而重劃後、此村彼村之不平、將益加甚、况不旋踵第二重　、又將來臨、如此層層重　、土地碎割之禍、將無底止、而困難亦永無突破之一日、</p>
<p>中國今日之農業八　口、在總人口之比例中、已超越應有之白分數、今後國民經濟、如有蘇生之望、則必須農業人口、漸　縮少、工業人口、日行增多、今閻氏之說，適為南轅而北轍、將使人人皆農、蓋土地村有制、雖非迫人人為農、而因為農可得一口分之利較之為其他事業者、一無憑依、悉須自力、其難易不可同日而語人孰不捨難而求易、何樂而不先有此一口分、以求苟活、牧即就整個國民經濟而論、閻氏之說、亦未可採也、</p>
<p>（四）移民調劑寬鄉狹、鄕非為本辦法之主體、而為本辦法之　帶規定，以濟本辦法之窮者、然就移民而論，亦大非易事、安土重遷、為農民之素習、一言遷移、國家不知須費多少擊張、始能從事、而移之之後、於其生活習慣、耕作技能、是否目達，尙不可知、就吾國之村落之村落情况而論、尙多為聚族而居、移甲姓之人、而居於乙姓之村、亦非人階之所能融洽無阻、自吾國中部及東南各省、縣與縣間、人口密度、相去不遠、　鄕狹鄉之調劑極難、就近今各種調査之結果、如浙如蘇、如湘鄂、均種感出地缺乏、有單就農民人口之數為土地平均分配、尙有不足二三畝者、如何而可就耕作能力而為口分耶、如求調劑於邊遠、則國家今日、有否如此力量，為大舉之移民大是問題、移東南之民以就邊遠、就現時之國　而論、殊病未能也、故此議亦徒足為參閱之資、而未可　有效之辦法也、</p>
<p>（五）以公債收買土地、以各種直接稅之收人、分年還本、其弊在於公債之信用者、以無關土地政策、始置勿論、其稅之加於農民本身、其弊有害政策本身之健全者、不能不一言及之、土地村有按口授田、而結果之必致於均一負擔、為理論上當然之事實、依閣氏之主張、嗣後耕民須納十一之稅、（收穫量白分之十）此較現時之田賦、已軍數倍、蓋農業經營·種子·耕牛·肥料·農具、其他必辦資本所費、普通佔收穫量之十之三四、終年衣食所需、何僅為收穫之十之六七、今又取其一、驟視之不為重、而詳計之、即知為不可勝之負擔、萬國鼎先生於其所著之中國田制史中、論均田制　與逃戶一節、頗　引述為證、「均田制度均授民以田、而逃戶之多、乃以施行均田制度之北朝隋唐為最、豈民不樂有田乎、非也兩漢不授人以田、而按畝徵和、故戶稅較輕、自均田制度行、而田租亦按戶徵收、故戶賦大增、然田之收授祗在政治淸明、田多人少時行之、遵行之時暫、而有名無實之時多、豪　兼併、貧弱失由、官不復授、而賦之車者已不可復輕、途至重為民病、相率逃亡非病有田也、逃重賦也、是則反因授田之名而貧弱蒙害矣……故均田制度卜之民生、是否優於兩漢或宋明、誠疑問」、此種識者之論、而吾於閻氏所主及之制度、有同感矣、至此種實物稅、收取之煩、損耗之　、以及於國家財政上之得失、又不待深論矣、</p>
<p>就閻氏土地公有辦法本身、約略論其利弊如此、辦法本身旣障得滋多、難期完善則其防共之力量如何、又不待論斷，且或正因其畫虎　犬、反引起人民之共產肯識、而苦無合理其產之方法共產黨因利染　、又可假借以為禍害也、贛省之共產分田運動、不類同於閻氏之制度耶此則不能不望閻氏之審愼出之也、</p>
<p>中國今已之土地政策、莫善於總理所倡道之平均地權、向　曾再三論之、其法不但　於今日之國情、抑亦合於世界未來之趨向、不廢私有之利而能　去私有之審、不取公有之名、而可有公為之實、法簡而　　、易行而　弊、乃不幸國人非狃於現狀不肯信價受奉行、即好為高論、另作主張以求沾名駭俗、　至非視平均地權為虛空理論、即視為平　無奇、誤盡蒼生、堪為浩嘆、今日防共有妙法乎、有之唯有取平均地　論篤信之力行之而已、不但防　而已、全部經濟改造民族復興之　運將於此卜之也、</p>
<p>松江　接通汽車路之反響</p>
<p>本縣松江至泗涇之縣道、前　縣府交由上松汽車公司墊欵興築、業已工竣通車、惟近以松泗路之北門、與松滙路之東門接通計劃、即將實現、在經過路綫之房、境墓、縣令自行拆除、地方人十以東門大街、亦在展築之列、設果實行、市街劃為二途、交通商業、俱受影響、日前民衆赴縣請願、未獲結果、乃推代表朱久望等赴京、陳訴雲間旅京同鄕會、請為主持、頃悉該會已電省廳、略謂、據松江公民朱久望等來京、陳術松泗路原定路綫、以北門　終點、迺承辦該路之汽車公司、割定路綫展至東門、所經民房墳墓、損害甚多、曾經分呈省廳縣府、請予制止、未奉批示、該公司忽於近日擅自興築、强迫柝遷懇請挽救前來、竊維路政設施、似宜於交通經濟、兼籌並顧、應請維持原定計劃、制止展築、如該路確有展長之必要、亦應就各業主所受損害、由地方公團評價紹償後、方予動工、以昭公允、誼關桑梓、迫切轉陳、「下略」又電縣府金縣長文云、松泗路展至東門案、民　未洽、正函地方人士及本會分電省廳、在未得正當解决以前、應請愼重處理、</p>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>徐舍扣繭案之糾紛</p>
<p>無錫大成絲廠、於本屆秋繭、在官興租行收貨共收乾繭五百餘據、裝船運錫、詎在徐舍、被蔣如鏡等鳴鑼糾集鄕　、以其　斷市面、　低繭、　迫鄉農、將乾繭四船全數扣留、當　該廠報吿無錫絲廠公會轉報商會、分電省政府曁民建兩廳、請求酌派保安隊、到鄕彈壓、護送繭船回錫、業奉陳主席曁余民廳長沈建廳長、先後雷令宜興　縣長、査明眞相、迅　解决、但迄今瞬將句日、繭船依舊扣、大成絲廠經理張季芳、曾派丁某赴宜、向各九接洽、亦未得有要領、而宜邑全縣各區區長、目聯名其呈縣府、為農民呼籲、　繭商　抑繭　、請求嚴懲刁詐、以免農民剝削之痛、糾紛愈趨嚴重、又永泰絲廠、此次在溧陽所收秋繭、扯價在二十元左有、同時戴埠方面、則扯價約二十七入元、鄕民以相差甚遠、認為有意抑價、故將該　繭船扣留不放刻尚相持未决、</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 葉恭緯</p>
<p>夫成湯解網，物類滋生，宣尼遠庖，仁者厭殺，所以示物我一體，勿相殘也，蓋人發殺機，乃災刧之端，欲弭災禍，惟在止殺，况今萬方多難，風雲色變，浩刧之來，尤堪　怵，本會爰於世界動物節之辰，召開宣傳大會，並舉行徵求會員，以冀仁者聞風畢至，共策進行，深願邦人君子，推愛及物，仁澤斯宏，不勝馨香令禱也。</p>
<h3>保護動物會與國際之關係</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>自一八二二年英議院通過保護動物之議案後，百年以來，若美，若法若德奧，若意大利，若俄與日本，以及其他各國，皆相繼而起　議動物之仁風，已遍滿世界，舉凡向之以天生動物原借人用之謬說，罔不因之而漸失信用，卽素來蔑視動物　，亦有漸表同情之趨向，誠哉惻隱之人，人人同眞，先聖後賢，其揆一也，我國開化最早，政尙寬大，俗尙厚仁　向以道德著聞世，卽對於動物，雖宋能完全禁止屠殺，然亦有相當之限制，如湯開二空。綱，孔子釣而不綱，弋不射宿，孟子聞其聲，不忍食其肉，以及天子無故不殺牛，大夫無故不殺羊，士民無故不殺豕；等，皆定為禮制，是可知我國古先聖賢，雖格於時代環境之情勢，不至悉如佛氏之一律平等，然其多殺不如少殺，復冀從少殺以漸達於不能之苦心，則昭然若揭也，乃晚近以來，一般學者，第眩於達爾文物競天擇之警論，而不深究最近世界人士所熟烈提倡保護動物之至理，拾其唾餘，棄其精髓，姑無諭我國固有之仁慈美德，胥因之而有江流日下，不可收拾之觀，卽就國際情往而論，當此世厭惡殘殺。主張推恩及物，以冀挽回刦運，免除戰爭之時期，而我獨悍然不顧，以動物為弱小可欺，不加保護，得無有違反國隊潮流，陷於孤立，且將令人譏我為畏强凌弱，野蠻殘忍之民族乎。同人等有鑒於此，爰有中國　　動物會之組織，以期减少一切動物之苦痛，化寃慘之厲氛，為祥和之瑞氣，同時藉以培養國人之德性，恢復固有之文明，與各友邦之仁人善士，互相提携人物之畛域已無，國族之界限自泯，以此求世界之大同而漸達於中和位育之郅治斯則豈獨動物界之幸，亦全世界人類之福音也，鳴呼，五濁河深心地有沉淪之痛，衆生業重性天無朗耀之期，保護動物者，亦卽保護吾人心性之切要工夫也，夫以素抱帝國　義之列强，亦鋻於世界之危機，而有此慈祥愷惻涵養心性之善舉，吾國素講仁義，乃反　之，豈不大可恥乎，噫；可以興矣。</p>
<h3>過去一年間會務簡術</h3>
<p>— 關炯之</p>
<p>溯自本會創議籌備，以至成立，迄今巳兩載有半，其初期工作，業於去年動物節擇要報吿，至最近一年以來深幸各界人士及各會員之熱心贊助，本會各項工作，不　災禍之普遍，社會之不安而稍停頓，蓋救災善後，撫輯流亡，係屬治標之法，而提倡仁愛，糾正人心，實為治太之方，是以益加努力，銳意進行，茲謹將過去一年間務，分別簡述於後，</p>
<p>（一）組織我國幅員遼闊，各地情形，頗多隔閡，欲推行護生事業，難免有鞭長莫及之憾，爰照預定計劃，廣設分會，計正式成立者，有陝商西京（長安）二處，正在籌備者，有北平，長沙，蘇州，如臯，東台等五處，大約不久當可次第成立，同時餘鞏固本會實力計，於本日　開始徵求會員，以資集思廣益，共　進行。</p>
<p>（二）　傳按挽近人類殘虐之風，已成積重難返之象，實足阻碍護生事業之推行，是以本會宣傳事項，不得不力求普遍，藉以喚起社會人士之注意，曾於本年春，商准新聞報館，刊行議生專刊，現計出版三期，以後仍當賡續進行，旋於夏七月，本會應時令需要，印製護生紙扇一萬柄，分贈本埠人士，得各界熱烈歡迎，旬日而盡，並於本年四月八日至十三日動物星期節協助本埠制止虐待動物會（西人設立）　集本市各中小學校兒童之護生圖畫二千餘幅，舉行展覽，亦予市民以深刻之印象。</p>
<p>（三）事業本會鑒於本市邑廟九曲橋池水汚濁，魚多致死，爰於，春三月，會同市政當局，設　拍去汚水，換以淸水，並以小魚每　魚鼈呑食，又設法提出，分別放養，又本年動物節，本會為提倡議生起見，先期電請內政部通令全國各省市禁屠一天，已蒙行政院令准照辦，此外根據各會員曁各地人士之報吿，籲請各當地政府禁止殺食耕牛田鷄，及制止捕殺野犬，殺剝胎羊，倒提鷄　等項，均一一分別辦理。</p>
<p>以上所述，均係犖犖大者，此外應辦事項甚多，尙待按步進行，至未來計劃，决定於最近期間，籌設動物治療所及組織掩埋隊等，以减少動物病苦，藉以維護衛生，深望海內仁者，錫以南針，助以實力，俾得早觀厥成，固不僅動物之幸也。</p>
<h3>護物芻言</h3>
<p>— 雙燕</p>
<p>今天是世界各國規定動物節。本市保護動物會。為欲人人明瞭保護動物的意義。便出了這張特刊。在這張特刊編輯時。主編先生來向我索稿。拒之不得。只得把我所能說的。寫些在下面吧。</p>
<p>記得袁簡齋先生有幾句話。他說天之之生物。以供紹人之口腹。吾人宰殺烹割。欲其死可也。欲其死而又令其求死不得。則不可。此與孟氏所謂見　生不忍見其死。聞其聲不忍食其肉。雖下一層。然尙不失仁者存心。吾人能免殺生固大佳事。設使不能。亦當不失此仁心。而欲對動物縲絏之。鞭撻之。使　悲痛哀號。求死不得可乎。</p>
<p>佛氏戒殺生。此仁心也。此仁心古今中外皆同。推而至於仁民愛物。則此心無不皆同。人生於天問地。與其他動物蓋無以異。故白物我同歸。能愛物者斯能愛人。不則摧殘同類。亦不過同此殘忍之心而已。故鞭笞動物。殺生以快朶頤。驅役人民。掠地以私權利。而迫之以就刀爼鼎鑊。砲火飛機者。同為世界之惡魔。</p>
<p>人倘於繫縲絏時。這獄吏之拷掠非刑。及諸種酷虐。莫不呼天難吿入地無門。寃憤塡膺。冀求一死而不得。試於此時。回想其他動物。受無辜之鞭笞緊縛痛苦。、心當亦凄然。憫之矣。</p>
<h3>動物的話</h3>
<p>— 術初</p>
<p>世界上除一切植物以外，就是動物的世界，人類本是動物的一份子，這是大家所其認的，人說的話，也可說就是動物的話，所以我便拿這四字來做我本文之題。</p>
<p>見報載×國××博士將某種活動物作醫術上之試騐，用着活的解剖又××博士將活的某動物用種毒液注射入肢體使毒液發生變化而有所發明，你若他為什麼要拿活的動物來試騐呢，他可無疑的回答你說，因為動物的生理與人是一樣的，那麽，不由我就要問他，你的子女，不是也同動物一樣麽，你為什麽不拿你的子女來解剖或試騐呢，可見人類確是一個最殘酷最自私的動物。</p>
<p>友人沈君石頑，為了保護動物的旨趣，和我談起戒了葷腥肉食，確是對於身心有相當的益處；，嗜食魚蝦的人每食便要傷害百千數的生命，不如百十人共食一牛，不由我反駁他說，百十人共食一牛，後少殺生命的事實上說，却是稍勝一籌，不過牛曾替人苦力農事，也可說他有養活百十人生命勞功。不報其恩，已屬無情，現再食其肉，那麼人眞是一種忍心不過的動物，若求之於其他蠢蠢的動物，恐怕也沒有這樣罷，沈君聞言低頭久久不語。</p>

<p>改堆聯運貨</p>
<p>國營招商局隴海聯運貨、初時卸在金利源碼頭棧房門、嗣後因南棧各碼頭貨棧、堆積南北洋各正班掄來貨、與長江輪船進口貨、尙不敷用、乃將連雲港裝來聯運貨、改堆在楊家渡碼頭棧內、而老窰來船、均卸在該棧、故堆備者多為西北運來貨物也、</p>
<p>棧中失貨案</p>
<p>該棧所存貨件、以隴海路裝來之　糧爲　多、近頃發覺該棧積存來貨中、缺少雜糧及其他貨物至五百數十件之多、此項缺少之貨、是否　竊、尙未明瞭、事為該局所聞、先由棧務科　査屬實、報吿總經理劉鴻生、對於短少貨件案、决計嚴行澈究、</p>
<p>撤調金棧長</p>
<p>此事應由棧長金澤如負完全責任、而理貨亦有相當處分、故將金棧長澤如免職撤查、一面淸理棧內存積各貨、一面澈究　缺之貨、據棧長到局陳述、言歷次客家　棧提取貨件、分袋換包等、不無短少之處、而　數額甚巨、以致累積短缺、殊非棧中職工舞弊、</p>
<p>新棧長視事</p>
<p>該局已委派林忠震為楊家渡新棧長、林已到差視事副棧長為李某、該局總務科長昨會同棧務科聯運股各主要職員、同赴楊家渡棧覆査存貨、一面於短少之貨、决計厲行追査、務獲水落石出、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （康健齋夫）</p>
<p>今天是世界動物節。全世界照例斷屠一天。當此國際風雲萬分險惡之際，帝國主義者的野心家方準備着二十世紀第二次人類的大屠殺，那些煦煦為仁孑孑為義的慈善的人們却　做着推恩及於禽默的宜傳。疋有類於陰霾四曾的黑夜裏露出遙天一角的微弱的星光。</p>
<p>「仁者親親而仁民，仁民而愛物。」本是博愛的大道之端。可是這個時代，仁民尙談不到，　論愛物。</p>
<p>人類倘肯退一步反省一下，家　氏因果輪廻之說來解嘲；人類的自相屠殺，也許便是人們一向傷殘異類的孽根果報呢。從唯物史觀的見解說起來，人類的自相屠殺，它的動機還在於求生。生存慾是天賦萬物的本性。那來愛惜異類的生命，爲衆生展緩一日之死刑，少流若干萬萬加侖的鮮血，或者也可以减輕人類本身罪孽的萬分之一罷。這却比譜時輪金剛法會及天主敎皇的和平祈禱較有實效可賭呢。</p>
<p>絕對的不殘動物，誰也知道是不可能的事。我們趁這動物節來提出幾倏愛護動物的普遍原則：</p>
<p>一，凡有益人類的動物，苟非必要，不加殘害。</p>
<p>二，凡與人類無利害關係的動物，應任其共存共榮。</p>
<p>三，凡有害於人類之動物，應殲減之，以减少人類之禍患。</p>
<p>四，屠宰生物之前，應設法縮短或减輕此種動物之痛苦。</p>
<p>五，凡玩好之動物，應盡量减輕其囚禁之痛苦，恢復其自由與天趣。</p>
<h3>動物節</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>「螻蟻微物，尙惜生命！」我們可以知道世界上一切的生物，都是貪生而惡死的，可是殘忍的人類，運用着靈敏的腦筋，來利用它們把人類服役，並且還將它們的一部分，（如牛·羊·豕·鷄·鴨等）宰割了充作食品或肴饌，供人們的大嚼！不過話又要分開來說，動物之中，可供人驅使，或有功人類的，是絕對不宜來充食品，並須加以周密保護，倘是無益人羣的動物，拿來充俎上之肉，也未始不可，更進一步說，如豺·狼·虎·豹等猛獸，對於人們非但無益，，而且要害人生命的動物，那是非除滅它們不可。</p>
<p>今天是世界動物節，本埠中國保護動物會，將在本日下午假座市商會舉行第二屆宣傳天會，同時並開徵求會員大會，各大報出版動物節特刊，各影院加映宣傳影片，且於早日呈請行政院內政部通令全國各省市縣，一律於本日停止屠宰一天，凡此種種，可說已盡保護動物的至意，不過，動物終究是動物，比動物更上一級的水災區域的災民，都在嗷嗷待哺，但望保護動物會諸君，移他愛護動物的一片仁慈，來設法救濟災民，那更功德無量了！</p>
<h3>續上海的拉</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>讀日前本刊「上海的拉」一文：覺得關於「拉」的事實，還有幾種，尙未提及。現在在下不妨也來談談，凑凑興趣。</p>
<p>在傍晚的時候，你如走過愛多亞路某一地段，那邊小旅館林立。有形似茶房的，在門首立着，或坐着。你就是不對他們去望，他也會很殷動地來招呼你。一喂：先生，房間要　？還有人家人，眞眞淸水貨，包你好。要開個房間，去白相相嗎」？你就是搖着頭，表示不要。他會跟着你嚕嚕囌囌的說着。像這樣的「拉」，却含有兩種意義。比妓女的拉客，又有些不同了。</p>
<p>在幾年前，晚間在馬路上閒步着。會有人輕輕地向你說：「總會裏要去嗎？裏邊有牌九，有搖攤，有…。包你不會出毛病。」不過近年來，租界賭禁很嚴。這樣的「拉」，已不可多見了。</p>
<p>一天，在下走過南市　處。那邊烟膏店，開着眞不少。見了這種含有神秘色彩的店舖，未免要向它行注目禮。忽然有身穿短衣的，跑過來說：「先生，要吃烟嗎？有陳膏，有新的床鋪，還有女人裝烟。」這樣，接連的過着二次。可惜在下不是有檢階級，沒有吞雲吐霧的資格。否則聽了這種誘人的話，眞要涎垂三尺咧。</p>
<p>在南市十六鋪東門路一帶，倘若乘了人力車，帶着舖蓋行李。會有人跟上來，或拉住車梗，向你打招呼：「你是不是上××倫船去，輪船票子要嗎」？這樣的「拉」，也時常可以見到的。</p>
<p>再有各處倫船靠了碼頭，旅客紛紛上岸的當兒：會有許多人力車夫蜂擁而前，兜攔生意。你若帶了行李什物，那就大受其累。任他們你搶我奪，不是物質上受了損失，便是要敲你的竹槓。還有碼頭流氓，乘機刦物的也有。像這樣的「拉」，行旅受害不淺，應該要嚴加取締才好！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>士廉搖手道：這個你不用說了，我全知道。現在我問你害的什麼病？你為什麽又坐在大門口？老太婆搖搖頭道：我自己也不知道是什麼病？不過心裏慌得很。我在坑上躺不住，我要坐在這裏望望我那孫女兒。士廉笑道：這不是笑話嗎？他住的所在，到這後門口，隔了好幾重院子呢，你怎麽看得到他？老太婆在那毫無神彩的眼珠裏，竟會流下淚來。顫着聲音道：是的，看不到的，不過我在這裏坐着，心裏好過些。說着，他左手拖了右手的袖頭子，只管去揉擦眼睛。士廉看了他這種樣子，倒也和難過。站着呆了一會，又向他家大門裏看看。問道：這很是奇怪。你一個生病的老太太，坐在大門外，怎麼你們家裏人，也不出來看看。老太婆道：我那媳婦也是坐在這裏，陪着我的。我都盼望我的孫女，難道他就不盼望他的女兒嗎？他去和我燒水喝去了。我那親戚胡嫂子，許是生了氣罷，不勸我們了。說到這裏，話說多了，似乎感到吃力，就將頭靠了牆，微閉了眼。士廉道：老人家你在這裏望了多久了？他睜開了眼，又把那兩個彎曲的指頭，向上舉了起來。士廉道：呵！你已經在這裏坐了兩天了。老太婆點了兩點頭。士廉道：老人家，你那孫女兒，他很好，本來要來看你，只是……老太婆連忙接着道：什麽？賈老爺放他出來了嗎？說着這話，手扶了牆，猛然的向上站起來。然而他究竟是起來得太快了，只這猛可的向上一衝，那是興奮起來的，隨着也就向下一落，幾乎倒在地上。這樣一個去死不遠的老人家，如何能經得起這樣一跌？士應看到，也就週身汗如兩下了。（三三二）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>（不列章）作者與譯者的會見</p>
<p>一日的早上，各報都刋布着伊離滬北上的消息，我知道倘若要見伊的話是不能再遲延了，只是我又知道我自己的脾氣太壞，看不慣那些洋飯　裏的洋管事以及一般所謂俊歐們的尊容，因此我特地候到下午三點二十分鐘模樣才懷着一肚子的好奇心，趕往北火車站去，作一次很倉獰，很不合禮的訪問。</p>
<p>走進月台，沿着那一列恍如鶴立鷄羣般的藍色車輛找過去，在第一個窗口內，就發現有一張胖胖的中年婦人的臉，脂紛塗得很濃艷，有一頂黑色的西帽低低的壓在額上，下面是兩支很流利而不很大的黑　子和一個扁平的鼻子。僅僅這一瞥，我就知道我所要見的人已在面前了。</p>
<p>那是滬平通車上的一間，頭等臥房，布置當然是極業貴的，我們的老公主穿着一身很合時的靑色西服，頸間掛着一串鮮櫻桃似的紅玻璃珠，（或者竟是寳右，亦未可知）很適稱地，坐在裏面。我就在已開着的門上叩了幾下，——兌了伊的一身洋氣，我也未能免洋了——伊照例說了聲Comein並站起身來，迎到鬥口。</p>
<p>我是一個長人，伊站起來祇及我的胸口，所以還覺得伊太肥而太矮了些，不能像「眞洋人」一般的高，但和本國的女太太比起來，伊大概總可列入第一級裏去。</p>
<p>伊想必也是受了老佛爺的薰陶，雖然已失却了伊的靑春，却依舊很愛打扮，一陣陣香水精的氣味不住的送進我的鼻孔中來，待拉手時，我又瞧見伊的指甲上，也都染着很紅的蔻丹。說實話，伊的確看來很年輕，祇像三十四五歲年紀的人，還不能够稱伊做老太太啦！</p>
<p>通過名姓，略自介紹之後，我就問伊這次到北平去了再回上海時，能不能留出一些時間，讓我跟伊討論幾個有關「御香縹緲錄」的疑點。伊當時便很誠懇的聲明這部書因為寫的時候，太忽促，錯誤一定不免，所以非常贊成我能够待伊南返時和伊詳細的研討，伊並且希望能够把我所譯的全部送給伊看。這一點我倒有些寒心，說眞話我的譯作實在有些見不得公婆面，但伊旣有此希望，好歹我總得硬着頭皮給伊送去。（二）</p>
<h3>期待着戰争的人們</h3>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>畫師高劍父</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>我國西洋書界的領袖人物，近年來　數劉徐二氏；但在現時郤有那位早已脫頴而深自韜晦的高劉父先生，崛起而成鼎足之勢。</p>
<p>我們若從藝事本身上觀察去，高氏自有他特立獨存的價值，索夾可以敎人欽佩的。他的中西法合參的繪作楚先有了國畫傳神的基礎，加以西畫寫眞的規模，拾棄雙方的糟粕而存其精華，融和了他的天才，故能卓然自成唯美的一派。他的一幅繪作，就給中西兩方有畫　素養的人賞鑑，决不會有一方感到什麽不舒服的。</p>
<p>我與高氏原無一面之緣，但記得我片面精神上認識他的開始，已是遠在民國三四年份；那時他正創有一家專賣美衛品的商店，開設在棋盤街商務印書館的斜對門，呌做「審美書館」。那店裏發賣印版的鏡框畫片，美術明片，畫集，和石膏像之類，有時也有高氏和其他名家的書盡眞蹟陳列着待價而沽。那時我只有十二三歲，我自己並不學畫，郤很愛看書，尤其對於高氏的畫有特別好感。我偶然瞧見了他所作的中國老法裝裱的條幅等畫，愛佩他獨擅的濃厚的氣韻，調和的色彩，總會有片晌的徘徊贍顧，大有戀戀不拾，得面甘心之意！因此，我就聯帶的對那審美書館漸漸有緣起來—大約是「愛屋及烏一至於—愛烏及屋的自然心理的表現罷。怎奈我年稚沒有買畫的財力，我不得巳而求其次，每逢經過那審美書館，常要選購幾種美術明片，多數是珂羅版縮印的高氏的畫。此後我在孩童時代所得的零用錢很有一部份是消費在這上面，這麽的三四年後纔被別樣興趣分化而漸淡薄下來；又隔了些時，我重復經過棋盤街，便不見了那審美書館，不知這店在什麽時候遷移或收歇了。</p>
<p>沒幾年前西湖博覽會舉行，我在那會將近閉幕時趕去觀光，並與西子湖作第一次的會唔。我郤在那滿壁琳瑯不少古今人所作精品的美術館裏，意外瞧到了這久違的高氏的繪作。雖是寥寥不過二五件作品，巳够造就我一舊雨新歡一時並致」這個愉快的聯想了！</p>
<p>如今是這位高畫師已經幸得抬頭於在生之世，身受到足副其實的盛名了，我也感到同情的滿足了！　情原是沒有十分恰當的：窮通顯晦，每隨時勢而遷移，毀譽抑揚，也不免有過與不及之弊，像高氏現在的環境總也可算是拜幸運之賜，世有幾人實至而得受公正處分的名歸呢？不過我見有人替高盡帥加着一個一革命書師」的尊號，或因他本人曾經努力於國民革命的工作，或又為他作品的含有革命性質之故，我有一點異議。論他的事業，革命是革命，畫師是畫師，原是兩種工作，未可混為一談。論他的作品，標榜其有革命性罷，並不足以扼要而盡其所長。這類不虞之譽，恐怕在受寵者是譽不加進，在發言者反為愛非其道了！</p>
<p>來函　主筆先生賜鑒，鄙人久患肺病，在京體治無效，春初曾函懇代為登報徵求良方，並請探詢益金草功效，當蒙於春秋欄內覆示，以徵方多弊，至益金草則經貴同事黃君夫人服過甚效，囑不妨試服。鄙人旋即遵向上海肇周路仁德里培生製藥公司購服，未及一月，病果霍然，迄今已逾半載，毫無復發現象，可知已根治無疑。感激之餘，特雨奉謝，並請求將原函登入春秋，俾同病者得一南鍼，諒勿見郤也。專此敬請犬安　梁伯新謹啟</p>

<h3>四川足球隊　昨敗於光華</h3>
<p>光華有許羅諸將效力聲勢甚盛　川隊缺少聯絡結果二對六慘敗　—今日川隊戰華南隊—</p>
<p>川省出席全運足球隊、於昨日下午三時半與光華足球隊作練習賽於光華球塲、川隊於三時到校、光華四川同學會特張貼標語、熱忱歡迎、該隊係四川二十一軍第四師足球隊組織而成、選手服裝上身籃呢外套、下身灰呢長褲、左襟綴以隊徽頗為莊麗、昨初試身手竟以二對六敗於光華、惟該隊球員精神可佩、惜有勇無謀、前鋒聯絡欠佳、失機甚多、倘能加以注意、必有可觀、願各健兒勉之以期在全運會中爭取地位也、茲誌昨賽詳情如次、</p>
<p>上半時　光華勢感</p>
<p>三時半裁判員姜靜南銀角一聲、雙方佈陣開戰、光華前鋒許竟成是東華勇將、羅斗文蔣兆祥亦是靑年隊中之翹楚、三前鋒聯絡作戰、未及十分鐘、許竟成中綫獲球傳於斗文、小羅飛起一脚、恰入網角、紀錄遂開、川隊努力反攻、曾正氣領導羣雄、向前開路、光華後衛軟弱、乃被深入重地、惜曾止氣脚頭不準、未中鵠的、雙方混戰片刻、許竟成大顯神威、羅蔣諸將、努力接應、球勢常在川隊門前盤旋、在二十分鐘內、小許連中四球、光華以五對零佔先、川隊雖力圖收復失地、奈諸前鋒聯絡未臻佳境、失却良好機會甚多、上半時遂以告終、</p>
<p>下半時　川隊小勝</p>
<p>易位再戰、以雙方勢力懸殊、光華羅斗文下野、許竟成調任後衛、勢已稍均、川隊選手仍努力應戰、不以見敗而有所氣餒、其精神殊屬可佩、五前鋒奔跑頗迅速、惜傳遞動作過慢、致不能稱心如意、混戰片刻後、鍾世金中綫遙射高球、落點離門十碼、光華後衛趙靄生左脚一勾、球向自己門內直入、凌宣不及對起、遂失一球、未幾，曾正氣再度進攻、闖入三關、輕輕傳與馬祖蔭、舉脚一掃、應聲落網、川隊連獲兩球後、聲勢較盛、光華蔣兆祥乘敵陣後方疏懈、偷營襲寨、暗渡陳倉、收回一球、旋以時間吿終、結算總賬、光華以六對一大勝四川隊、陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>小男兒（六五）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>幸而險境不久脫去，裴夫人吩咐童子們、起回去睡覺，只留着賴司務留心看守，免得火再爆發，然後她同了拂朗再去看那一對不幸的孩子究竟怎樣。小橋只得着一處灼傷和一個粗大的疤痕，韜摩呢，不但他所有的頭髮大半因灼焦而脫落，並且他臂上有一大火傷，竟使他痛得幾乎發在。他們不久便將小橋安頓了，拂朗送他到自己的牀裏，安慰他使他不再驚恐，並目竟像慈母一般，為他哼着歌，使他沉沉睡去。納綏徹收照顧着可憐的韜摩，想减少他的痛苦，裴夫人往來於他及小坦第之間，手裏拿着棉花，油，正痛藥等，口裏常喃喃自語，彷彿她想到這一層時也殊有不少的歡愉，道，「我一直知道韜　要有一天把房子着火的，現在他已把這句話實現了！」</p>
<p>第二天早上裝先生回家來，見到了這一團糟的事情。韜摩睏在牀裏，坦第喘氣如小鯨魚，蜀夫人疲乏已極，全部的童子們緊張得很，見了他都齊聲要吿訴他昨晚的故事，竟猛曳了他去勘那個火燒塲。他以鎭靜的態度處理一切，各事漸復條理，因為人人覺得有他到了，即有十次的大火也够他辦理得了，而且凡他分派給他們的工作，他們無不戮力去做的。</p>

<h3>孩子也要書籍</h3>
<p>— 林斯德</p>
<p>LutherBurbank說：「孩子們喜歡玩泥餅，捉蚱蜢，蟋蟀，水蟲，蝌蚪，田鷄和鳥龜；採接骨木果子，野楊梅，橡果和栗子子，爬樹，打水，折蓮花都肯幹，愛捉土撥鼠，蝙蝠，蜜蜂，蝴蝶和各種動物。在草塲十拾松球，滾石頭，撒沙，蛇行和打大黃蜂子，像　類的事，從來沒有一個孩子自制過，和自制過這些關於他所受的一部分好的敎育。」（註一）</p>
<p>Burbank所提出孩子們應有的東西，我們還可增加一點，那就是每個孩不應有他的書。</p>
<p>從之字裏找趣味，以書籟為娛樂，是歷來認為，種消遣的活動。讀書是文化的工具，巳經被世人所承認了，它是敎育上所必需的。但是『敎育』，自從我們有了它到現在，它對於受敎者的個人閱讀的心願上，向來是沒有保設的。這簡直是個怪異的矛盾之事。談到重視與運用書籍，要有相當的修養，常常遭人們的反對，所以有人說過　正讀了書的成人，僅僅是小部分。其中對於古今的文字得有識別與有　趣的讀者，究竟是少數，就是素稱敎育許及的美國裏，據一九二六年讀書的情形，「美國有一萬六千萬人民中，幾有五千萬是讀書人民，而這九千萬的讀衆，除了看看每日新聞和軟性的小說以外，大半是不讀別種書。』（註二）眞正在書本裏求知識的和玩賞高深的文學的，也是　極了。那麼，現在我們從此知道了，要研究兒童，必須從他們的幼稚的環境裏去找書籍的重要可能性。我們並不是說時常把孩子關在　裏翻檢他們的字典，或者拿本聖經推在他們的坐位上，更不是把他建築小屋的畫完全推翻，來用百科全書代他堆起，乃是從他能拿起他的布面書的時候起，他就有用他的書架和圖的資格。</p>
<p>孩子他自己卽有會穿衣吃飯和獨自睡覺的能刀，自然同樣的，他也有用他的書的能力。孩子的穿衣睡覺，自然不能加家裏的人相同，就是飲食方面，也不能一樣。因為他是個嬰孩，　特別看護與養育他的　確的天性，以及使得他的身體的發育强壯，與時俱增。書籍與孩子，如同他的床塌樣地帮助他完成起來，使得十分的完成，那就是說，書籍可使孩子產生出良好可為的能力。</p>
<p>Moore　說過「孩子們必須把他們從書本中長成起來，對於那些書籍的選擇，必須愼重齊遍於人生的各方面，同時要符台孩子的天然的趣味，切不可含有奢侈的質味。最要緊的，要注意他們的心智上和精神的發育與變化，如同給良好的食物，為保養他們的身體一樣。此外，也　豫防他們的購買力，就是對於　選擇的書籍的價值方面，必須願到每個家庭裏的預算』。（註三）</p>
<p>生穆爾所說為孩子子們選擇書籍應該「普遍於人」，這是個極好的見解，不過我們還要討論如下，就是我們對於最小的孩子在什麽方法？孩何使兩歲的孩子用得着書？以及我們如何使素子對於他的書藉能够發生社會的和理智的要呢？這倒是些疑問。</p>
<p>我們繼續一生的事業，必須得知事業的稱心與受益，至於成人閱讀的習慣，如同在書本裏求知識，找娛樂，是逐漸　去學習，並且要從頭學起，他們才能從書籟裏得着滿足的經騐。所以，那是極明顯的，假如我們要兒童愛出書籍，以及希望拿　讀的習慣來關係他們的生活，自然我們也應供給他們這種進取的創造經騐才對，可是，現在流行的書籍，誰能評判那幾種可以供給小孩子呢？</p>
<p>說到孩子有些討　的動作，常常是被一般大人們生厭惡，其實這種複雜的素因，並不是厭惡就可了事的，那還是要我們慢慢地敎他去做「比方我們要孩子拿着書拿得正當的話，那一定需要一個成人去親切地指導他纔可以的。我們看見孩子拿着一本燦爛光彩而適意的書，坐在一坪靑草地上，那種光滑色的紙張，翻出沙沙地響聲，和用那織巧而有鑑識的手指畫出一條一條的藍色紅色或黃色的記註，（註四）那是多麼自由自在啊！</p>
<p>孩子是極愛圖書的，從前有兩個育嬰堂的學生，他們足足看了一天的圖畫書，他們的年齡大約是兩歲半的樣子。某天有一個孩子為了某件事跑出房了，他從椅子上爬起朝外就走，忽　地把他的書掉在那塊地板上，當時被另個孩子看見了，就很小心的拾起來，輕輕地放在桌了上，並且很莊重地責備那個孩子說：『不可以這樣，書是好東西！」像這種情形，就是個確鑿的證據——同時我們想到那個孩子說那話時所傳出的神情，是多麽有昧喲。</p>
<p>可是在實際上，我們又能够做到什麽？在家庭裏，限於預算，以及上了幾個孩子的家庭裏，或者地方有限，或者時間不許可，能够供給為帮助孩不知道那種書籍是「好東西』嗎？所以第一步重要的計劃，就是我們必需把時間和金錢能够獨立，在我們的家庭裏面，要把書籍當做孩子的生活的一部分的必需的態度，並且使我們對於書籍予以敬重，以及給書籍、種　嚴的地位。這個意思决非是我們為為書籍所支配，而是給書籍在我們的生活上有個限制的地方，要常做娛樂上，學識與能力上的工具一樣。假使我們抱着如此的態度，就算對得住孩子。走進這種模範的家庭裏，他們的尊重小孩子，尙能適合孩子的行為。至於孩子的根本必需的東西，自然是在父母互相為他們計劃。如同那些圖書害的購置，在家庭預算裏是要有準備，等於給房間為孩子住，以及允許孩子有娛樂時間一樣。</p>
<p>這裏所有的方法的貢獻，是在買那些書為孩子，决非是過於浪費的一種要求。更希望像這樣的夾啟發，個孩子直到成人為止。書籍是孩子身體上的食肉，是精神上的酒；書籍可給他，種正當方法，在家庭間有共享及友交之用，帮忙他的生活從家庭的界限走到大的世界裏、書籍供給他處世的經驗，使他辨別人生的味道。所以說，嬰孩也要書籍。</p>

<h3>水</h3>
<p>— 蕭歌</p>
<p>他們六個。白干灌飽了，還得辦公事去。</p>
<p>搖搖幌幌的走，還忙着剔牙，是捨不得留在牙縫裏的鷄渣。</p>
<p>辦公事，走進了綢緞鋪。</p>
<p>「黨櫃的呢」？照例是老頭子常前辦公事人，三根牙鬚多少長些威風。</p>
<p>『幹麽的』？胖箇子從櫈上立了起來。</p>
<p>「攤派一些河工茶水錢，你老就是掌櫃」？牙籖丟在地上。</p>
<p>「不……過我們早僱定了河工」。</p>
<p>「是的，是的，你老僱的河工，當然給工錢。不過……不過我們為了窮苦人家……</p>
<p>「我說，大水能來不能來？</p>
<p>「不能，不能……所以窮苦人家派了工沒法兒，飯是要吃的，茶亦　喝，所以我們幾保裏，終得想法貼補些。亦是為大家的事呀，當櫃的，是不是？」</p>
<p>「不過這年頭呀！』手　　頭以。</p>
<p>「這年頭，　道不想活命？」隨來的小夥仔，話是燥性些，老頭子看了他一眼。</p>
<p>掌櫃不說話。</p>
<p>「頭道堤不是潰了嗎？」</p>
<p>「聽說×村亦到了水！」</p>
<p>店夥計最關心這些事。</p>
<p>「現在十萬民夫日夜搶修第二道堤，×村不過灌了二尺水。」</p>
<p>「要是水再漲，就毀！」</p>
<p>「是呀，所以我們終得盡吃力。掌櫃的，是不是？」</p>
<p>掌櫃的早已悄悄地坐在壁角裏，老頭子走過去。</p>
<p>「掌櫃是……」</p>
<p>「那麽你要我出多少錢？」胖身子在椅上搖頭下。</p>
<p>「五塊，派五塊錢。」</p>
<p>「五塊！」憤憤地立了起來。</p>
<p>「我們都有賬的。」</p>
<p>掏出幾張紙，攤在玻璃台上，但是掌櫃並不看牠，憤怒地走了幾步，立定說：</p>
<p>「當保長的，你給我算算，每天派四工，四六二十四，就得二塊四毛錢一天。你們還要茶水咯，什麽咯，人家亦出不了　！」</p>
<p>「那末你出不出？」小夥仔又燥了，紅紅的臉上靑筋漲得幾分高。</p>
<p>「呌人家怎麽出得了？」歪了歪身體。</p>
<p>「不出，送公安局！」</p>
<p>「公安局，好，去！」</p>
<p>掌櫃英雄地走到門口，却被老頭子趕上抓住了。</p>
<p>「好說，好說，小夥仔們性子才燥。』</p>
<p>「我去，我去吃官司！」</p>
<p>店夥計都上前勸解，性燥的小夥仔躱在門口咆哮着，鬥口圍着不少人看，是非常熟鬧。</p>
<p>街上又起了紛擾。</p>
<p>走過一羣苦力，那當頭的舉根竹竿，竿上連串着十幾個穗糖。</p>
<p>「大家看看四人吃一個　　！』</p>
<p>「我們不幹了！」</p>
<p>「化了人家錢，自己受用。』</p>
<p>「鬼操的小舅子！」</p>
<p>一陣亂嚷，綢緞舖裏的熱鬧移到街上。掌櫃首先跑出門，看了看，跑進來跟老頭子撞個滿懷。</p>
<p>「什麽事？什麽事？」</p>
<p>他們六個，趕上了一羣。</p>
<p>「什麽事，四人吃一個　　。」</p>
<p>「我操你娘！」</p>
<p>「你駡誰？」老頭子氣喘地跟蒲走，想攔也攔不住。</p>
<p>「罵那些化人家錢，自己受用的小舅子。』</p>
<p>「胡說！沒了天，跟你們去見區長。」</p>
<p>「好，去！」</p>
<p>他們六個，跟這一羣很快地走着。</p>
<h3>拆字攤</h3>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（二）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>但是，當我反省到這種感化力的時候，我却不由害怕起來了。</p>
<p>事件一幕一幕地演進下去。東洋的風雲緊急了，終於爆發了戰爭。一般的愛國昂奮，戰爭熱，動員令，出征……軍事宣傳漸漸地露骨起來了。而且還具有着相當的效果。突然，在銀幕的暗處，湧起了小孩子們合唱的歡送出征兵士的歌聲。——在那一瞬間，我跟妻都不免在心裏感到一股惡寒的襲來。</p>
<p>但是，一般觀衆却只有狂熱。</p>
<p>一會兒，就展開了旅順的攻擊，日本海的海戰，和奉天的激戰。在這些演出裏，日本的陸軍曾開出夾作後援，都着演員旺盛地活動過。我覺得這　了不起。我甚至於這樣想：雖說少數的反軍國主義者曾經試行作種種的對抗；但要防止這種國家所援助的宣傳之感化力，幷不是一件容易的事情。</p>
<p>接着，我覺得自己也好像在再度經騐着日俄戰爭的時代。因為在那個時候，我還是個小小的鄕下的中事生，跟一般國民一樣，也曾在那愛國熱和戰爭熱的眩目而猛烈的渦流當中經分過的緣故。事實上，何曾有過比那時候的國民還要更加一致團結在愛國主義和軍國主義的狂熱當中的事情呢？現在，看着這「吉岡大佐」的影片，我就想起了二十年前的那種緊張，狂熱的一般人們和空氣，甚至於還不免感到一種依戀。</p>
<p>但是，妻比我年輕得多，而且沒有直接生活在那個時代，因此，對於我的這種情感，是完全沒有理解的。而這「吉岡大佐」，尤其是戰爭的塲面，在她就只能够看見那些悲慘而殘酷的，可厭的東西。因此，在走出影戲院的時候，她就說起她實在後悔剛才沒有不看這影片就回家去。</p>
<p>我一點也不覺得她的心情有什麽不合理的地方。毋寗說那大概是當然的。但是，跟剛才說過的一般，在我却有着回憶那個時代的一種依戀。</p>
<h3>一個嬰孩的誕生</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>妻　有分娩以前，我巳經開始躭憂起來了。這對於我們不蕾是個生死的關頭哩。</p>
<p>窮窘的生涯早使我們陷於顚沛流離之中。每天為了僅可微飽的飯餐，我們已是絞盡了不少的腦汁。每年為了僅可溫曖的衣服，我們已是想　了多少的法子。對於饑寒的襲擊，我們雖然歇盡了生命的全力去抵抗，但到頭來還是一樣地忍餓挨凍，一年三百六十日中，我們簡直就沒有一天過過好日子</p>
<p>和苦腦，彷彿已經成為我們日常生活的一部份。</p>
<p>對於這不幸，難艱，黯淡的歲月，我們真有說不出自己內心的一種感慨！</p>
<p>現在，威脅在我眼前的是妻快要生產了。倘在有錢的人家，或是渴望着子孫的人們，這倒是一件喜慶的事。</p>
<p>可是，掙扎在生活鐵輪之下的我們，這不但沒有感覺到什麽愉快之可言。反之，正因為這件事，使我們更加沉湎於不安之中。</p>
<p>妻是初產，時於沒有經歷過的事情，她特別躭心着自己的生命。在平日，從鄰居的人家的口中，她曾經聽到種種難產的故事。於是，這死的殘酷的模樣，死的悲慘的印像，死的可怕的面月，深深地已經直穿過了妻的潔白底心，使她的生人增加了一層陰雲，烙上了一個更大的創痕。</p>
<p>我呢，也具有同樣的感覺。對於妻的憂慮與恐懼，幷以為是過份的。然而妻的體質却太孱弱了。那因為平日過度的操勞及營麥不足之故。這對於她的生產，顯然大有不利。我想，世間有多少不康健的女人，正因為生產的難關而通過不了　們生命的血路！</p>
<p>想到這，我不覺為妻悚然　駭，於是替妻心急了。</p>
<p>但，除了愁思之外，我們有什好的聲法去補救呢？這好像每天必須衣食一樣的必要。我們能够阻止那人性的一種自然底要求嗎？唉，這世紀的窮人，連人生天然的一種樂趣都被削剝了。</p>
<p>妻，因為近於臨產，所以很焦急。她拖着笨重的大肚皮到處去設法。可是白跑了幾天，到處的朋友都和我們，樣的窮</p>
<p>我呢，在從前，還有職業的時候，月中倘是短少一些錢用的時候，還可以向人借貸。但現在，已經不行了。他們如道我們沒有收入，窮；還不了債。所以就不敢放心借給你了。</p>
<p>那怎樣辦哩？難道祇有聽從危運的播弄嗎？</p>
<p>妻今天生產的微　更加顯明。肚里時刻發生陣陣的楚痛，彷彿受了毒蛇咬着她的心腸似的，在床上輾轉，呻吟，號哭，聽到這聲音，我的眼淚就淌下來了。</p>
<p>「嗨，這是生底掙扎啊！」我對着自己說。</p>
<p>妻漸漸疲倦了。口渴，肚餓，想吃一點酸的東西。於是我給她一片波羅，（是罐頭的，我的一位朋友送給我們的。）妻接了，咬了兩口，馬上便吐出來。這東西，好像巳經腐了。我想：一定是陳貨，朋友是食圖價賤買來的。</p>
<p>「那，吃點粥吧霞。」妻點點頭。</p>
<p>可是，她簡直沒法吃得下去。在往日，我們都是忍心去克制着自己　量的人。那會有東西而不高興吃的道理呢？</p>
<p>「這是生產的特質啊！」我對妻說。妻楚痛的，無力的點點頭。</p>
<p>平息了不到半小時，妻突然又呼號起來。輾轉着，臉是鐵靑的。那種難堪與慘白的容顏，使我疑心是站在一個臨危的病人之前。這時，死的恐怖與殘酷，死的痛苦與慘涼，驀然又透進了我的心底里。</p>
<p>唉，如何纔好呢？顧產婆的希望是沒有了，我自己是「外行」，隔鄰的張　已下鄉去了。親屬們遠不在這兒。……</p>
<p>驟然之間，妻的狂呌比以前更加尖銳，她葡萄　，雙手按着床板，一陣　陣無力的呻吟，跟着一陣一陣的血，從那里，浴了紫紅色的血，一個無邪的嬰孩出現了。</p>
<p>他嘩啦地嘩啦地哭着，聲音里，已是含有一種人世之苦難。</p>
<p>是這樣，妻徼倖逃出了「火綫」，但從今後，在我們的生活上，又增加了一層　負哩！</p>

<h3>「世界動物節」感言</h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>據報載：中國保護動物會已得行政院之恩準，以十月四日爲「世界動物節」，令飭內政部轉飭各級政府通令，於是日免屠一天。</p>
<p>而今居然也就到了這個節日，「各級軍民人等」，是否遵令不吃肉食，我們自然不得而知·不過，縱然今天大家就算不曾殺生，我想一過了今天，一般困在囚籠中的動物，也決不會逃得過牠被宰的全運的。記得俗例於「送灶日」曾有買鯉魚來放生的習慣，我以爲，這倒比諸免屠一天來得乾脆些。不過，前者好有目的）。其實，却是殊途而同歸的：一樣救不了動物們的生命。</p>
<p>以前曾有過「長生羊」一類的故事，是「聞其聲而不忍食其肉」，但是一背了面，却就連「吃人肉」也沒有什麽不忍了。所以自古來人殺人的事就永遠不絕地產生，而被殺者又多數是象「長生羊」一樣的弱者十二十一年前在歐洲曾演過大屠殺的一幕，其一年後的今日，許多强暴者們又在霍電地磨着利刀。</p>
<p>說敎者老是把人們的生命歸諸於天，去年的旱災，今年的水災也都是天變。於是更有人說是下界冒犯了天庭，所以要禁屠，要行善事結果，災民一樣是失所，死亡，流連……然而「善心」的人們却依然躱在洋房里，米點施捨也並不曾出現。而且，反會有人乘機發了大財。！這到底是什麽玩意：是善心，或是慈悲？……</p>
<p>今天是免屠了，然而明天呢？人們肯放下屠刀了麽？—我雖不爲動物們危，但却爲人類悲！</p>
<h3>故居</h3>
<p>— 唐雯</p>
<p>訪一個朋友不遇，我便路去拜訪從前的居停主人。</p>
<p>是三年前的冬天，大病初愈，醫生囑咐我應該靜養一些時間才能工作，由朋友的介紹，以最低的房租在這裏賃得小樓一角。小樓面臨公園，我每天早上挾了册愛讀的書或是一份報紙，在公園的靜僻所在，獨自披書閱報，淸遺寂寞的上午。居停主人是個中年喪妻的單身漢，有一個在小學讀書的九歲孩子，他自己在一家銀行裏任事。當我搬去的時候，除了星期日，我們很難謀面。我起得早，每天六時起身，吃過點心，就到對面公園去，所以往往在門口遇到送報人的脚踏車。晚上又睡得早，他歸來的時長不一定，郎使他有天準五時歸來，知道我有早睡的習慣，只有我下樓會他，他决不上樓來的，而且當時還維持着賓主之間的身份，總是不着邊際的閑談而巳。他是個天主敎徒，星期日的上午帶着孩子到敎堂去做禮拜，下午我們才有機會坐坐談談。可是過了那個冬天，他失業了，說是銀行裏裁員。那一天他似乎很興奮，到我樓上來，提着我的手說：從此還我自由之身了！幾個月的同居，我們始終沒有直率地談過自身的事。那天他的態度雖然顯得那樣懇切，我或許以爲他一早失業了而說出那樣消極的話，我當時像普通朋友一般地鼓勵他。他搖搖頭，更握緊了我的手說：</p>
<p>「我和那個銀行的關係是很膚淺的，不過我的父親在生時曾挽救過那銀行的危局，父親死後，他們隨意給我一個位置，而他們所以那能慷慨，因爲還有一點父親未了事宜，是需要我來負責任的一；那末我的解僱早在意料之中的，不過時間問題而己，這個世界完全以金錢作威情的依歸！要不是爲了父親的未完責</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>任，我也不想在這名利之塲浮沉了」。</p>
<p>從此次談話以後，我們的友誼進了一步。他薄有資產，他現在的責任是敎養惟一的兒子了。他妻子臨死時，曾囑咐他續娶妻妹，對她的骨肉好另眼相看，但是他堅不續娶。此後，他的身世的痛苦，都在平時談話之間吐露出來。他說現在留得這個自由之身，想好好讀點書，再學習音樂，以竟暮年。當然一個中年人是不應該那樣消極的，但是自己同病相憐，再不能像普通朋友一般地說些毫不相關的鼓勵話了。</p>
<p>我們同居了半載，為了生活，我還是以貧弱之體在這名利之塲浮沉了。一有職業，又忙於奔走，難得有一個假日到故居去徘徊一天。此次不見面又幾個月了。</p>
<p>行近小樓，一陣悠揚的鋼琴聲從前面送來，我望見那曾居住半載的小樓一角，飄着綠色的窗帘，一束康乃馨探出她的花朵在窗櫺之上，裏壁似乎也煥然一新，聽那鋼琴聲正是從樓中送出來。我雖然不懂音樂奏些什麽，但是那樣明快的琴聲可以知道奏樂者一定有着快樂的心境或許我的老友在午睡之後，起來奏一曲琴，而且今天是星期，他的兒子一定已隨侍在側。想着，覺得我的朋友還是幸福的，不由地加快了脚步，到那熟悉的階前按了門鈴，我希望他的兒子像小鳥一樣地跳出來拉着我的手，一邊喊着爸爸跑上樓去。但是開出門來是一個不相識的老嫗，我道要見她主人，老嫗回答我主人在莫干山沒有歸來，兩位小姐在上海。詢問了他們的姓氏，原來老友和他的兒子已在兩個月之前到外埠去了，這小樓已換了主人。我更想知道一點詳細情形，那老嫗祗搖搖頭把門關上了。</p>
<p>悵然若失地站在門前，聽見裏面的鋼琴聲又悠揚地奏了起來。</p>
<h3>到長沙</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>（這兒所說的長沙，並小是挺響亮的湖南長沙，而是咱們廣東靠近大海的地方的一個也算挺有名的長沙洲。）</p>
<p>從廣州搭三埠的拖渡，到長沙以前，是挨過了一個海面的夜。在秋天的時候，海面的夜是很美麗的，那平靜的江水，輕輕地淙流着，全不像那狂濤的大海一樣閃着驚險而迷人的銀白色的波濤。但是，這兒夜裏的江面，也少不了許多令人迷醉的影子，就好像臨到了詩意而撩人的境地裏一樣，雖看不到像都市裏穿若妖惑的衣裳的歌舞女一樣，但是，我可以聽得到沉靜的鄕村裏的平野間響着颼颼的風聲，這幽幽而浸着人們的心靈的風聲就有着一定的調子的，誰說她不迷人呵！在這樣死靜的夜裏的江面，聽到她就像聽到詩境的歌聲一樣啊！所以，我總是忘掉了該是睡覺的時刻，在甲板上，靜靜地徘徊着，眼睛望若一幕遼遠而迷朦的地野。地野啊！那是給南海上掠過來的風吹得像無數的少女在搖擺着，抳批着一樣的。就是當我把腦袋望上天空的時候，那淸朗的天　着無數的星兒，誰說夜的江面不美　喲！於是，我的心靈裏不知不覺地就溶化在美麗的鄕村旅行裏去了。是的，在上海，我從沒有過這樣的幸福，從沒有過這樣的威覺呢。</p>
<p>等到我聽够了風嘯，聽够了驊啦嘩啦的江水的淙流的時侯，疲乏了呢，該是睡覺去的時候了，我才躱進艙里，做夢似的禱望着明天的早晨，明天就到長沙了！那是四周圍都給江流包着的沙洲呀！那兒該有許多美麗的風景來給我享受吧！年靑的流浪人是這樣的想念着的。</p>
<p>第二天醒過來的時候，太陽還沒有比我更早點兒的爬起來呢？我又跑上甲板上，吸那輕飄而新鮮的空氣，眺望那兩岸的靜寂的景物。——船過公益的時候，正是太陽爬出來，整個大地都接上了鮮紅而艷麗的衣裳了，那靑的山峯，碧綠的林子，全在閃着紅霞呢！這可愛的早晨，更不是我流浪在上海的時候可以享受得到的哪。</p>
<p>到長沙的時候，我可以望見一個新的地方，三個埠——新昌荻海和長沙鼎足似的在海的旁邊，那些建築物都跟廣州一種，齊整而美麗的。不錯，這也是用華僑的血汗建築成的地方啊，而長沙洲的一方面，除了那遠遠的廣大的平野和竹林問的村莊以外，就是那長長的街市，這地方還不算是很生疏的，就早些年頭也到這兒來旅行過，如今，可以叫做重遊故地吧。是的，我很愛戀着這個地方，因為，這個大沙洲是很有趣的，叚如有幾個朋友在黃昏的時候，用小艇兒繞着全洲而掉行一周的時候，也不過用四五個鐘頭吧，但是，我們可以看到許多天然而不用修飾的景物，全不像西湖那兒染着資本的市塲一樣的色彩的，更不像繁華得要死的大都市的一樣的虛偽的啊！假如散步在縱橫的阡陌中，綠的禾田的迷人的姿態，一切都是樸實的，而且，這個地方的風景雖不饗亮，但根本上，再修飾一點兒的話，我總相信他是挺有名的沙洲公園了。（但是，那時我又不高興來游了吧！）</p>
<p>可不是嗎？我有一種習慣而且是嗜好，我愛吃新鮮的菜子比什麽還要厲害的，這兒就是產菓很有名的地方了。</p>
<p>到了長沙埠頭，携帶着簡單的行李就繞着市街，到市街的盡頭處就是生滿了池塘的蓮葉的中山公園。不錯，那兒就是我要去書宿的學校了。等到我們的朋友出來接我的時候，我看見三百多個小孩子美麗的女孩子們都張着愉快而親切的眼珠子來看我，於是，我不知不覺的就在淘氣而天眞的小孩子們里混着，一切都像早晨的太陽一樣可愛的呀，等到孩子們全離開了，我的時候我就倚着三樓的欄杆來眺望前面的公國，遠遠而灣曲的江水，那平齊的建築物，吸着新鮮的空氣，於是，一切的都把我的心靈的悒鬱打消了。</p>
<h3>合家都在秋風里</h3>
<p>— 江敉</p>
<h3>東行草</h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>也許是我個人的偏威吧，到東京來後，每一件事物都使我覺得非常新鮮。朋友，為了你也是好奇者，所以我把所見聞的再吿訴你。</p>
<p>到東京來第一樣使我覺得新鮮的便是日本人的衣着，當然，在上海你是常常看見日本人的裝東，但是，在上海的少女，早已着了上西裝，要看一位穿着東洋裝服的少女，恐怕是很難得吧？所以，這會使我覺得新鮮了。我到來時，正是夏末初秋時份，她們都把鮮明的大花朶的花樣着上了身，兩個袖子長長地拖到膝邊，頭髮在後面分開了兩半。走起路來，活潑幽靜。我們在後面看去，便會想起一隻美麗的蝴蝶。我曾跟友人到過一次舞塲，在那裏，我看見穿着艷色的「和服的舞女，她們的袖子更加長大，跳舞的時候，袖子臨風飄蕩，實在另有美態。</p>
<p>日本女人的衣着，在我們異國的眼光看來，似乎大概都相同的，其實，牠的變化並不遜於我國女子的旗袍呢。不單樣式時有改變，就是花紋也跟着季節不同。所以，每逢季節快要更換時，各大公司便在某一層樓上陳列着數十種一九三五年式的新春或新秋的『訪問着』。樣式花紋都非常華麗。所謂「訪問着」，是「和服』中最重要和貴重的衣着，是出外或訪友時穿的，價值昂貴的，有值日金數百元，單是一條訪問帶，也有價至三十多元的，這種「訪問着』的花紋樣式，都換縱在「吳服店」中設計師的手裏，每一種花紋樣式的變化，卽使微細到我們看不出來，但日本婦女一看便知那是否流行的花樣了。不過這些自然是以有閒的太太小姐們為限，至於那些勞働的女子如女賣票員和下女之屬，是沒有功夫理會到這些的。</p>
<p>男子們的裝服是比較簡單，除了穿「和服」之外，為了辦事方便起見，已經很多人着「西裝」了。不過他們的西裝也很隨便，闊點也可以，狹點也無妨，樣式更談不到那一年式的，縱使穿了一九二五年的樣式，而你遠一九三五年的人。不像我國人事廳　人後，唯裝飾要搶先，一九三五年還未到，一九三六年的式樣就將要過時了。</p>
<p>說到日本學生的裝服，更加值得注意，無論中小大學，男女學生一律要穿學生裝。同時，他們絕對的不講究，且還以穿破舊的學生裝為榮，有些學生，便拿帽子揩桌凳，使帽子戴到油光鏡面，方足表示他的資格老。而帝大的學生還要在襪帶上掛一條面巾，吊在外面，走起路來，一搖一擺，簡直使你發笑，但他們却以此為「神氣」，故我國留日學生，日子久了，也都學日本學生的模樣，把滿好的西裝藏起來，終日穿學生裝了。</p>
<p>女學生的裝服樣式較多，但大多穿裙衫。她們很最重裙子，穿裙便是表示有禮貌。她們的裙都是加在外面，擁腫不堪。我們看了雖覺好笑而她們正以爲這才是知識份子的禮貌處。</p>
<p>我國留日學生的服裝，如果從國內初來，一時總　改變，有不少仍穿着漂亮的西裝。所以，大家都這樣說：「東亞的學生最摩登。」其實這就是表示他們是新東京，還沒有資格穿學生裝呢　過了一年或半載，他們便也自然會改變過來，不過，女子則比較難改變，無論在東京住多少年，總是喜歡穿旗袍，這大槪是比較舒服和便當的緣故。</p>
<h3>雜感</h3>
<p>— 楊仲碩</p>
<p>近來越發孤獨了，對佛家所謂禪宗那類說法頗引起點興趣，然而自己到底還很年靑不願讓生活染上消極的色彩，這自省的功夫還是最近才養成的。</p>
<p>想起自己的頹唐難免趨向那墮落的路上，於是又把灰冷的心重新振作起來，對人對事，對學問都很注意，但是生活比較嚴肅一點反而惹起朋友的憎惡，孤獨的性格並非天賦，原是環境造成的。</p>
<p>季候的變遷曾經給我一些刺激，蕭蕭的的秋風吹拂着我蓬亂的頭髮，也曾令我感到伶仃的凄凉，我也曾對那些枯黃的落葉發出同情的憐惜，江上的扁舟一葉也曾引起我不少詩情畫意，然而我畢竟不是丹春妙手沒有把這幅天然的圖畫塗諸紙上，我也不是詩人沒有將這美麗的景色吟成一首淸暢可誦的詩讓我所見所懷都表諸字裏行間，對自己的淺薄也曾咀咒過。</p>
<p>是秋天，江水已無夏天時候那末混濁，但是對着那汹湧澎湃的怒潮我好像獲得這麽一個啟示：人生該如潮水一樣勇邁前進衝毀一切荊棘潘籬！</p>
<p>許多人在這秋高氣爽，風和日暖的時節從遼遠的地方來到這裏，也許郵浩蕩的大江引起他們無限的興趣，也許那矗立江畔的高塔給予他們不少懷古的思想，他們一批批來，又一批批去。</p>
<p>山上的楓葉已呈紅色，迎風搖擺像一個含羞的少女在跳舞，記起隨園曾有過這末兩句詠楓的詩：「草上有時隨意落，花中無此可憐紅，」眞是刻畫入微了。</p>

<h3>天倫配音音樂東方化</h3>
<p>以往國片配製音樂的很多，但多取材於西樂，問或有部分配製中樂，但這所謂的中樂也就是極普通的廣東樂曲，至於匯種樂對於戲的演出效果是否能有　助，那就很難言了。聯奉，這次對於「天倫」配音，可說是十分愼重，特聘專門人才日夜繼續工作，力求音樂與影片打成一片，能獲到混合美得效果，幷且，所配的樂曲，極力避免留聲機盤一類的爛調，要專為這戲來編製樂譜，要使其東方音樂化，像這種創作，是値得注意的吧。</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Son-in-Law Leads Air Force to Cover Italian Troops' Invasion of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Abyssinia Asks League of Nations for Protection; Italy Cables League, Saying It's a Precautionary Step; League of Nations Council to Meet Tomorrow</p>
<p>(London) The war in Abyssinia has already broken out, with fighting taking place in two locations. One is in the Danakil province on the northern border of Italian Somaliland, and the other is in the Ogaden province in the southeast, bordering Italian Somaliland. Italian troops first heavily bombed the town of Adowa in the far north of Abyssinia with aircraft, followed by an infantry attack. Details are unknown, but according to news received here, casualties on both sides are heavy. (Reuters telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Asmara Italian troops began to invade Abyssinia this morning. As expected, the attacking Italian forces advanced directly towards Adowa from the Eritrean border. Adowa was the site of the Italian army's defeat in 1896. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Asmara Italian troops infiltrated Abyssinian territory in a skirmish line, then converged on Adowa in dense formations. At 6:30 this morning, numerous bomber fighters and reconnaissance planes flew across the border. The joint air and ground offensive targeted Adowa, Adigrat, and other nearby areas. Mussolini's son-in-law, Ciano, led an air force commando. Mussolini's two sons led another squadron of fifteen aircraft. More aircraft departed from other airfields, enabling the long-awaited Italian offensive to be launched under air cover. The vanguard crossed the Mareb River at dawn, followed by machine gun teams, and then large units of infantry. The army traveled through mountainous terrain, mostly following valleys. The Italian vanguard consisted of a mixed force of Blackshirts, regular army, and native troops. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Evening News published a dispatch from its special correspondent in the Abyssinian capital, stating that approximately 20,000 Italian troops occupying the Musa Ali area of Abyssinia today advanced in three columns. The Italian troops immediately clashed with Tangalakay tribal warriors stationed in the area. The number of deaths is unknown, but the Italian troops have not yet made contact with the formal Abyssinian army. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia today notified the League of Nations of the Italian military's aggression. The Italian government also telegraphed the League of Nations, stating that Abyssinia's general mobilization forced the Italian military in East Africa to take "extraordinary steps." The Abyssinian Emperor's formal message to the League of Nations protested the Italian air force's bombing of Adowa and the Italian military's attack, resulting in fierce fighting near the suburbs and significant loss of life and property. The Italian message stated that Abyssinia's general mobilization forced the Italian military headquarters in East Africa to occupy several strategic strongholds for precautionary purposes. The League of Nations Council has decided to convene a meeting on Saturday. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, notified the British government today through the Foreign Office that military authorities in the Italian colony of Eritrea in East Africa had decided to occupy certain locations in Abyssinia due to their strategic importance. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini today broadcast a "Message to the Nation" via radio to a thousand Italian men, women, and children gathered in various locations, exclaiming, "We will meet war with war!" Mussolini's declaration continued, stating, "The League of Nations is now considering sanctions, but I do not believe that the true French people will unanimously support sanctions against Italy." Speaking about the East African situation, Mussolini's tone became more severe, saying, "Our country has endured Abyssinia for thirty years, and now it is unbearable. Fascist Italy now firmly declares its strong will to develop in East Africa." It is generally believed that Mussolini's declaration is the final answer to the question of war and peace. Mussolini declared regarding economic sanctions, "We will face it with discipline and a spirit of sacrifice." With Mussolini's declaration, the national mobilization exercise also came to an end. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital A general mobilization order was issued throughout Abyssinia today. The government also ordered troops to concentrate on the 12th of this month in Taissie, about 200 miles northeast of the capital, where Prince Hussen's headquarters are located. After reading the national mobilization order, Minister of the Palace of Abyssinia, Lij Kaba Dabasso, stated that Italy was preparing to invade our territory, and this was the second war in which world opinion and God would help us for our country and our king. It is widely believed that the Italian army will launch a general offensive tomorrow, and Italian planes may also attack the Abyssinian capital. The Italian ambassador may receive his passport today and travel to Djibouti tomorrow. The Italian embassy is now heavily guarded by troops. The Italian consul in Adowa is said to have been detained by the local authorities. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) A communiqué was issued here today, stating that the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa had been instructed, for safety's sake, to advance to certain locations beyond the existing lines of defense, and pointed out that the Abyssinian general mobilization order was a manifestation of the warlike spirit of the Abyssinian leaders who had again requested war. The Italian government also issued a document stating that Abyssinia's protest to the League of Nations about the Italian air force's bombing was an old-fashioned tactic that had been abused and contained elements of preparing for the future. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Rumors that Italian troops had invaded the Adowa area of Abyssinia were officially denied a short while ago. It was said that formal hostilities in East Africa had not yet begun. As for the news that Italian troops had occupied the Musa Ali area, the authorities neither confirmed nor denied it, saying only that the Italian-Abyssinian border in that area had not been demarcated, and it was possible that the Italian troops had moved forward to improve their defensive posture. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Imposes Sanctions; Japan Declares Non-Participation</h3>
<p>Maintaining a Neutral Stance</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As of noon on the 3rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received confirmed reports of the Italian army's attack on Abyssinia. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude toward the Italian-Abyssinian war is as follows: Italy's attack on Abyssinia is unavoidable. Abyssinia has declared that the Italian army has invaded and has filed a complaint with the League of Nations. The Japanese government will maintain a neutral attitude towards this dispute. If the League of Nations invokes Article 16 of the League Charter, Japan, as a non-member of the League of Nations, has no obligations or responsibilities. (Japan United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Defeated by Abyssinian Army?</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital It is reported that the Italian army attacking the town of Agaam between the towns of Adowa and Adigrat has been defeated by the Abyssinian army. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Youths Leaving France to Return Home; Crowd at Station Angrily Curses</h3>
<p>Shouting "Down with Mussolini"</p>
<p>Toulouse, France Today, a number of Italian youths returned home by train to serve in the military, in accordance with the general mobilization order. Before their departure, the crowd at the station shouted slogans such as "Down with Mussolini" and "Oppose War." After local residents heard the news that 50 Italians had been ordered to return home to serve in the military, they rushed to the station, intending to prevent the Italians from leaving. A large number of police arrived to suppress the crowd, resulting in a conflict. Many people were injured, but not seriously. An Italian Consulate official was unharmed after being protected by the police. It is reported that approximately 4,000 Italian citizens in the Toulouse area have received orders to return home for military service. To date, only 50 have complied. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, crowds demonstrated in the streets, shouting "Callot" and "Down with War." The police dispersed the crowd and arrested 14 leaders. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that a certain American bank today shipped HK$200,000 worth of goods to New York on the Canadian Empress. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Italian Front Lines: Well-Equipped and Ready for Slaughter</h3>
<p>Italian Front Lines in Eritrea The Associated Press correspondent attached to the army inspected a 250-mile front line today. The line formed an equilateral triangle with the apex at Asmara and the base along the Mareb River valley of Abyssinia, a total of 60 miles long. Italian military officers were unwilling to disclose any troop movement information, but the reporter, based on his experience on the British and American front lines in the European War, the Moroccan War, the Spanish front lines, and General Pershing's expedition to Mexico, believed that the highly anticipated war was about to begin. Italian officers and soldiers were in high spirits and were awaiting orders to attack. From a military standpoint, all practical difficulties had been resolved. The roads were flat, the water supply was ample, transportation was convenient, and food was plentiful. The reporter also saw hundreds of donkeys and horses carrying machine guns moving along the Italian front lines. According to the reporter's observations, only rain could stop the Italian military's actions. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>World Animal Day</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Today is World Animal Day. All European and American countries have grand commemorations and extensive public opinion campaigns for this day. Famous people give public speeches, and radio broadcasts are used to explain the significance of animal protection. Some schools have mandatory lessons to raise awareness among students. As for personal expressions, they are too numerous to count. The Animal Protection Society of this city has also decided to hold a public awareness meeting on this day to align with the world, embody Heaven's virtue of loving life, and strive to eliminate cruelty and killing. The intentions of benevolent gentlemen are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The animal protection movement began long ago, more than a century ago. At that time, animal cruelty was prevalent in England. Under the protection of the Church, animal protection societies were organized. However, the roots were not firm, and the response was minimal. It was not until 1835, with the strong support of Queen Victoria and the passage of laws in Parliament to protect all livestock, that the society was able to celebrate a smooth future and establish a permanent foundation. Today, animal protection is a familiar term, and the atmosphere has long permeated the world. Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and other countries all have animal protection organizations. The Animal Protection Society of our country was also established in Shanghai last February, following in their footsteps and contributing to the cause. The achievements of the past year are already evident. For example, establishing release gardens, hiring veterinarians, relocating aquatic animals from the Yuyuan Temple Nine-Bend Bridge, requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Government to stop the capture and killing of stray dogs in various counties, and contributing suggestions to the Public Works Department to strengthen the prohibition of animal cruelty. All of these are targeted at addressing urgent needs based on facts. Are we not willing to extend our deepest sympathy to this compassion for all creatures, not just paying lip service?</p>
<p>Some may think that the world is filled with murderous intent, the prelude to a great war is about to begin, and humanity has no time to protect livestock when it is busy slaughtering each other. Moreover, even in terms of unethical treatment, the suffering of humans is probably far greater than that of livestock. How can we devise a comprehensive plan to prevent such inhumane and cruel acts from recurring in today's world? However, animal protection is something that ordinary people can easily influence and directly address. Preventing cruelty and killing cannot be achieved by simple actions. We can only focus on what is close and easy to do, hoping to use the power of continuous publicity to slightly reduce the signs of gratuitous cruelty, and further want to base this concept of animal protection to gradually promote a sense of mutual compassion among humans, so that they can gradually transform each other, think of love and help, and thereby automatically stop their cruel acts and abandon the evil thoughts of war. Therefore, the significance of animal protection today, when extended, is certainly sufficient to achieve the ultimate goal of safeguarding humanity.</p>
<h3>Dike Breach on the Xiaoyi River in Haizhou; Salt River Under Pressure, Rising Water Threatens Xinpu; Part of Guanyun Affected by Disaster; Jiaomu Transportation Cut Off</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Donghai Telegraph, The Yellow River water downstream of Liutang surged violently, and the Xiaoyi River dike in Donghai suddenly breached several tens of meters yesterday. The water flowed south, affecting part of Guanyun County. In addition, the Salt River was also under pressure and flooded, threatening Xinpu. People from all walks of life are inspecting the water situation and are rushing to build ten embankments day and night. The Huangfang Associations of Donghai and Shuyu counties re-telegraphed Guanyun, requesting that the Chaimi Salt River gate and dam be opened quickly to release water into the sea. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Pingshang, Tanggou, Datongxingyao, and Liheng townships in the Fifth District of Shuyang, were flooded because of the breach of the Pingdun embankment on the left bank of the Chaimi River. In addition, the area east of Wuji in the Fifth District is a vast expanse of water. Transportation between Haizhou and Shuyu has been cut off. The Datang embankment, which protects Pingshang Tangshui, also breached yesterday, and the water flowed directly to the Zhoujia River mouth. The district office has chosen a place to relocate. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Within the Huai-Pi section of the second section of the Flood Prevention, the Yun embankment at Qilijiafang north of Zaohe overflowed, with a length of about 40 meters. The Telegraph Office reported the progress of the emergency repairs on the 2nd. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Flood Prevention Office, the Weishui water level stabilized today. Yaowan rose one inch, with a current level of 275 inches. Suqian rose two inches, with a current level of 224 inches. Qingjiang rose two inches, with a current level of 252 inches. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The flood disaster in northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly severe, and various counties have requested the Huai River Diversion Association to remove the water-gathering dams. Xu Kai issued a statement on the 2nd, stating that the construction of the Liulaojian water-gathering dam on the Central Canal was based on the decision of the Economic Committee and the Huangfang Association, which was to divert the Huang River water south into Weishan Lake and then into the sea through the Central Canal and the Liutang River. Recently, detailed measurements showed that the flow rate through Liutang was approximately 800 cubic meters per second, while the flow rate through the Liulaojian water-gathering dam into the canal downstream was also 500 cubic meters. The water level difference between the upstream and downstream of the water-gathering dam was about 18 centimeters, which had very little impact on the flow of the Central Canal in Liutang. He and the Jiangsu Provincial Government are currently requesting instructions from the Economic Committee on how to handle this. However, after careful study, it was found that the Liutang Central Canal is currently the only way to discharge the Yellow River water. The Yellow River mouth has not been blocked, and the accumulated water is too high, and the inflow is surging, far exceeding the drainage capacity, causing the water level to rise daily and expanding the disaster area. In reality, the water-gathering dam has no significant impact. (Central News Agency Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Continues to Rise in Sui Territory</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Suidian Tuoke County Telegraph, According to the report from the head of the First District, the Yellow River has risen by more than two feet in the past five days, and the Heihe River has risen by about one foot. It is still rising. In addition to supervising strict blockages, a telegram is respectfully reported. Sazhou County Telegraph, The Yellow River water rose another inch today, but there is no danger. The 27th Yellow River water rose another two inches, and the situation is still dangerous. In addition, Feng Heming, the head of the surveying team of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, telegraphed the province, The river water is rising rapidly, and both banks have overflowed, flooding many fields. The water situation in the west of the river is particularly severe, with a flooded area of more than ten li. Surveying work is difficult. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Xubu Shelters Refugees; All Repatriated Out of the Territory</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xubu sheltered more than 2,000 refugees. Because there were no funds to support them, they were all repatriated on the 2nd. Trains were provided on the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways to transport them home. They spent the night at the station platform, crying and shouting, making a terrible scene. They were all transported away on the morning of the 3rd. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee Meeting Discusses Sanctions Issue; Research Steps to be Decided by the Executive Yuan; Britain Plans Vigorous and Swift End to the War; France Still Does Not Abandon Conciliatory Action</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee is scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM. The chairman is Spanish representative Madariaga. The discussion will focus on the issue of sanctions. Since the war in East Africa has already begun, the question is whether the League of Nations will immediately implement sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant or follow the original procedure of the Thirteen-Nation Committee drafting a report and recommendations based on Article 15 of the Covenant. This will be considered. Therefore, the Thirteen-Nation Committee must discuss whether the Italian army's invasion of Abyssinia constitutes an "unprovoked aggression" and whether Article 16 of the Covenant can be invoked to declare sanctions. Once the Executive Yuan holds its meeting on Saturday, the task of the Thirteen-Nation Committee will come to an end. The Executive Yuan will then decide on the steps to be taken. Regarding the Abyssinian Emperor's request to send an investigation team, experts from Britain, France, and Spain will submit a report to the Thirteen-Nation Committee, stating that since war has already broken out on the Abyssinian border, sending an investigation team would be futile and dangerous. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the telegram from the Abyssinian Emperor to the League of Nations accusing Italy of invading the Abyssinian border was received, it was distributed to all members of the League of Nations Executive Council. The Executive Council is likely to convene a meeting in Geneva. The Executive Council can be convened at any time today. Except that today's Thirteen-Nation Committee is convening, the Abyssinian administration is in complete disarray. The Italian delegation is almost entirely in Rome, with only a few low-ranking officials remaining in Geneva. Various parties related to the League of Nations currently do not believe that Mussolini has made a final decision. The news of Italian troops violating the border reported from Abyssinia and the total mobilization test conducted in Rome yesterday have caused great shock here. However, the Italian side believes that the actions of the Italian army do not indicate that the war has begun, but merely a movement towards strategic positions. The Executive Council may immediately decide to arrange aerial surveillance to determine whether Italian troops have invaded Abyssinian territory in the northeast corner of Wossa province, near Mount Moussa Ali. If there is indeed a border violation, the Executive Council will convene a meeting, and the League of Nations General Assembly may also be reconvened. According to independent sources in Geneva, approximately 50,000 Italian troops with aircraft are concentrated near Mount Moussa Ali. The border line in that area is slightly ambiguous, so it cannot be determined with certainty at this time whether Italian troops have actually entered Abyssinian territory. Today, when the Thirteen-Nation Committee convenes, it will discuss the Abyssinian Emperor's suggestion to send League of Nations observers to conduct on-site inspections. At the same time, Mussolini's speech in Rome yesterday is seen here as having left very little hope for peace. Many observers believe that this is the final declaration before taking action. One commentator even called it a "war speech." (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Britain's opposition to Italy's use of force is becoming increasingly strong today. Those close to Prime Minister Baldwin say that the Prime Minister will respond to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech when he speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth on Thursday. It is also said here that Mussolini's speech has made the British Cabinet determined to curb his ambitions and to swiftly end this dispute through collective sanctions. (National Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Britain is prepared to fulfill its promise to impose sanctions on Italy, but only on the condition of cooperation from other countries. Before today's Cabinet meeting, Foreign Secretary Hoare and War Secretary Hore-Belisha met with the King. After the meeting, the War Secretary, the First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and the Secretary of State for Air Londonderry held another meeting, which shows that Britain has already implemented its announced policy. It is reported that the Cabinet discussed whether to inquire with Germany and the United States about their attitude towards League of Nations sanctions against Italy. The questions for inquiry will include the following three points: (1) Instructing Minister Eden to solemnly declare at the League of Nations that Britain will not act alone; (2) If Italy is indeed the aggressor, then the arms embargo can be lifted; (3) British-French cooperation to deal with the European crisis. (National Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British and French representatives attending the League of Nations meeting have exchanged views on the issue of imposing sanctions on Italy and have reached a consensus. It is believed that a gradual approach should be adopted, and it is believed that these sanctions will be limited to economic measures, such as refusing loans to Italy and prohibiting the export of raw materials to Italy. In addition, the French Foreign Ministry has stated to the British government that France does not intend to impose sanctions unless it is a collective action. Therefore, the attitude of officials is more optimistic than before, believing that it will not be long before drastic sanctions are implemented. It is also believed that the tense international situation will not increase at present, and it can be seen from the attitudes of Britain and Italy that the danger in the Mediterranean is still expected to decrease. As for the British government's previous inquiry to France regarding whether the French Navy will cooperate with the British Navy if the British fleet in the Mediterranean is attacked, France's reply will not be decided until the Cabinet meeting on Friday.

<p>(London) It is reported that the British Cabinet meeting decided to instruct Minister Without Portfolio Eden that if news of war between Italy and Abyssinia is confirmed, he should request the League of Nations General Assembly and Executive Council to convene meetings immediately. However, in any case, there will be no such action before Friday, as Eden must wait until tomorrow to leave London and will not arrive in Geneva until October 4th. Also, Eden will meet with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval en route to Geneva. Regarding the British inquiry about what attitude France would take if the British Mediterranean fleet were attacked, a reply from France should be available soon. In addition, the first thing Britain should do is lift the arms embargo on Abyssinia. The Cabinet has decided to do so immediately after Italy and Abyssinia officially declare war. Officials believe that sanctions can only be limited to economic measures, while business and industry figures still oppose cutting off trade relations with Italy, saying that it would harm the interests of many countries. If it is unavoidable, then it must be done gradually. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) France has informally indicated to Britain that the French government will give an affirmative answer to the British government's request for joint British and French naval action in the Mediterranean. (National Telegraph on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to French sources, Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti visited French Prime Minister Laval yesterday and reiterated that if Britain only implements economic and financial sanctions against Italy, the Italian Navy will definitely not launch an attack in the Mediterranean against the British fleet. The opinion in Paris is that since the British government has stated that it does not want to take any action unless it is a collective one, France is now not giving up "conciliatory action." Informed sources here believe that any sanctions will not be excessive and will not cause international tension, so the European dispute in the Mediterranean seems to be avoidable. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After French Prime Minister Laval attends the Cabinet meeting on Friday, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will bring instructions to Paris to assist the French Prime Minister in formulating the "guidelines" for the Thirteen-Nation Committee. At the same time, the news that Italian troops are approaching the border of French Somaliland has caused concern here. However, well-informed observers are very skeptical about whether French territories will be involved. It is reported that French troops are now being sent to Djibouti in French Somaliland to strengthen defenses there, but they will not arrive until the beginning of next week.

<p>(Paris) This newspaper's diplomatic correspondent has learned that diplomatic circles are not expressing surprise at the outbreak of the East African war and are now considering taking economic and financial sanctions to shorten the war. The first step is to prohibit loans to Italy; the second step is to prohibit the transportation of goods to Italy. The complete blockade of Italy will be decided at a later date. In other words, it will be implemented only after the League of Nations Executive Council unanimously decides and the Abyssinian war has not ended. This is because Article 16, paragraph 1 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that once the Executive Council designates the nature and severity of the aggression, it will choose among the various sanctions. Diplomatic circles here believe that the initial sanctions adopted will be milder measures and that more drastic measures will be adopted only after these measures have been tested for a long time and deemed ineffective. It is generally believed that once this procedure is adopted, it will not cause international disputes, because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech yesterday and the guarantees provided by the Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti to Prime Minister Laval both stated that Italy would not strongly resist economic sanctions, and the British government is only considering collective action and does not want to take any action alone. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the current negotiations between the British, French, and Italian governments are mainly aimed at making the East African conflict localized and not involving the European region. The general impression is that European war and Mediterranean disputes can be avoided for the time being. It is reported that Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti reiterated to French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval yesterday that the Italian government will not take any aggressive action in Europe first and will strictly adopt a defensive posture in the Mediterranean. If the League of Nations sanctions are limited to economic and financial measures, Italy will not take any steps that would harm European countries. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of sanctions, officials believe that only two kinds of economic sanctions can be adopted: one is to prohibit arms to Italy, and the other is financial sanctions, and the third is to boycott Italian goods. Regarding financial sanctions, that is, refusing to lend long-term and short-term loans to Italian countries, groups, or individuals. Regarding boycotting goods, it is generally believed that 60% of Italian exports are purchased by member states of the League of Nations. The United Kingdom accounts for 11%, France and Switzerland account for 8%, and the remaining member states account for 41%. In addition, non-member states, namely the United States, account for 9%, and Germany also accounts for only 9%. Therefore, if the League of Nations decides to prohibit its member states from purchasing Italian goods, it will naturally hinder Italian export trade and reduce its financial resources. Although this method may not take effect immediately, the East African war can be ended sooner, and there will be no disputes with non-member states. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Reaffirms U.S. Neutrality; Reviews Naval Maneuvers</h3>
<p>San Diego President Roosevelt, in a speech at the California Pacific Exposition today, reiterated the U.S. resolve to remain neutral in the event of war elsewhere, saying many Americans are uneasy, fearing some countries will repeat the foolish acts of twenty years ago, and the result will be the fall of culture to the extent that global restoration is impossible. Such fears are not unfounded. Whatever happens overseas, the U.S. not only wants peace, it is extremely anxious to avoid dangers which might damage its peace with the world. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>San Diego President Roosevelt, in a speech here today, affirmed that regardless of what happened overseas, the U.S. must maintain neutrality and freedom, and that Americans deeply feared war would destroy world civilization and make global restoration impossible. The American people are passionate about freedom of religion and equality under the law, and so cannot tolerate the enforcement by other countries of laws violating these principles. This remark by the President clearly targets the German National Socialist government. Regarding the issue of U.S. restoration, the President said the government would not permit deflation and wanted to rebuild on this wreckage. He also intended to explore policies to raise prices, especially agricultural prices, as this was a prerequisite for industrial recovery. The President continued by saying that the nation's people were not anxious to return to the gold standard. (National Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Flagship Houston Before departing for a tour of the Panama Canal today, President Roosevelt reviewed the largest-scale naval exercises in U.S. history at the San Diego naval base.

<h3>Berlin Observers: Germany Will Also Maintain Neutrality; Official Opinion Not Yet Announced</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Official circles here are now closely watching the situation between Italy and Abyssinia. It is rumored that the League of Nations intends to ask non-member states to express their attitude on this case, so the masses are paying more attention to this matter. The opinions of official circles have not yet been revealed, but it is expected that Germany will abide by Hitler's declaration made near Nuremberg that Germany does not want to intervene in events that are not related to it. At the same time that news of the Italian military's invasion of Abyssinia reached here, Hitler was staying in Tannenberg, and it is expected that he will return to Beijing earlier.

<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Announces Strict Adherence to the League of Nations Covenant; Visit of German Representative Has No Political Meaning</h3>
<p>Beijing Belgian Prime Minister Theunis today in the joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives announced that the Belgian government is now able to strictly adhere to the League of Nations Covenant, that is, the Locarno Treaty, and declared that the visit to Beijing by German Head of State Hitler's special envoy for disarmament, General Ribbentrop, has no political meaning. When talking with him, he only touched on general issues. According to reports, after Ribbentrop's recent visit to Beijing, rumors arose that Ribbentrop had suggested to the Belgian government to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries.

<h3>Italy Exercises Total Mobilization; Mussolini's Speech; Audience in Front of the Palace No Less Than 100,000</h3>
<p>(Rome) Tonight, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stood on the platform of the Palazzo Venezia to address the crowd. The secretary of the Fascist Party led 10,000 party members to line up in front of the palace to listen. When Mussolini spoke, the number of people gathered in front of the palace was no less than 100,000, and the number of people listening through wireless radio was even more unknown in the millions. At the same time, the British Embassy was closely guarded by 300 fully armed military police, and the Abyssinian Embassy was located in the suburbs of Rome, and its surroundings were also stationed with three layers of troops to prevent accidents. Mussolini previously stated that at this time, 20 million people across the country were happily listening to his remarks. He then said that Italy died 600,000 people and injured millions in the European War, helping to achieve the common victory of the Allied countries, but the spoils of victory belonged to other countries, and Italy only got the remainder. France should not forget the Italian soldiers who died in battle. He did not believe that France would now be willing to participate in sanctions to protect barbaric countries, but Italians must not ignore the possibility of sanctions. We will respond to economic sanctions with spiritual discipline, to military plans with military plans, and to war actions with war actions. However, Italy will do its best to ensure that the conflict in the colonies does not expand into a conflict in Europe. The audience in front of the palace applauded thunderously at this point. The Italian Prime Minister continued, "Today, those who are advancing towards their destination are not only the troops, but 44 million Italians are also united in hatred and advancing with the troops, because some people are trying to inflict very dark injustice on Italians and take away the little land they deserve. The Italians waited patiently for 20 years, and now someone is trying to inflict austerity on the Italians and block their vitality. Let others not think that they can make the Italians submit. The Italian people have never shown their spiritual strength and character power as they do now. The Italian people are the nation on which mankind relies to achieve its greatest victories, that is, the nation of poets, soldiers, and artists. Now someone dares to speak of sanctions against this nation!" At this point in his speech, the Italian Prime Minister became agitated and said, "Do I entrust the victory of Vittorio Veneto and the Italian Fascist Revolution? Let it rise quickly! Let our people convey their unwavering cries and determination to our soldiers in East Africa to give them comfort and security!" Finally, Mussolini announced that the national Fascist test mobilization had ended at 7:00 tonight. Mussolini did not explicitly mention the start of the East African war in his speech. As soon as the speech was over, the audience cheered for the Italian Prime Minister under the guidance of the secretary of the Fascist Party and then dispersed. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Annual Conference; Advocates Expanding the Navy; More Than 2,000 Delegates Attend</h3>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party held its annual conference in Brighton today. Representatives from various party associations attended, totaling more than 2,000 people. The first day of the conference focused almost entirely on debating the resolution proposed by Craig and Churchill, advocating that national defense be built to the extreme, regardless of the amount of expenditure. After the audience listened to the speeches of Churchill and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, they unanimously passed the case. Before the debate began, the audience cheered in favor of the motion proposed by Congressman Brigadier General Sir Croft, congratulating the government on the general policy of restoring commerce and finance, which has achieved progressive victories, and urging the active expansion of this political initiative. Party leader, Prime Minister Baldwin, will conclude the meeting tomorrow. Several other resolutions will be considered at tomorrow's meeting, one of which opposes ceding British territory to foreign countries without first obtaining the consent of the local British, and another which calls for special efforts to revive the suffering areas. When Churchill proposed the national defense case, he said that the major shortcomings of the national defense forces should be repaired immediately, especially for organizing various industries to quickly use them for national defense, and to renew efforts to make the British Air Force equal to the strongest air force country within a significant distance from the British coast. This is the responsibility of the government. Churchill also urged the government to rebuild the British fleet and strengthen the military to protect Britain's food sources and living needs, and to maintain the unity of the British Empire. Chamberlain replied that there was no need to remind the government to pay attention to its responsibilities to the country in defense matters, and the government had already started to handle everything described in the resolution. He also said, "Now, if everyone is willing to disarm, then we are also willing to disarm, but if others do not engage in disarmament, we must fill the gaps in defense so that the country can obtain security and maintain the empire, and fulfill our obligations to other countries. We are not supporting the League of Nations for this reason. We support the League of Nations because we believe that we can use the League of Nations to eliminate wars and lay the foundation for peace through collective action. If the League of Nations cannot do this, then it will not fulfill the task we hope for. Before abandoning the only hope that seems to be laying the foundation for a permanent peace in the world, we must be sure that the League of Nations really cannot do this." The Chancellor of the Exchequer then touched on financial matters, saying that our responsibility is first to guarantee security, and then to consider the issue of national wealth.

<h3>National Legislative Yuan Roundtable: Invitation to German Ambassador for a Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Legislative Yuan invited the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Oskar Trautmann, to hold a roundtable discussion at the Yuan at 10:30 AM on the 3rd. More than 40 people attended, including Sun Ke, Wu Jingxiong, He Sui, Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, and Wei Tingsheng. Dr. Trautmann, accompanied by Counselor Lauterspil, arrived at the Yuan on time. After being received by Sun Ke with Chuan Bingchang accompanying him, he immediately joined the meeting. First, Fu Bingchang delivered an introductory speech, briefly stating that Ambassador Trautmann had a long history and rich experience in German politics and diplomacy. His presence at this meeting to report on the recent political, economic, and diplomatic situation in Germany would provide valuable information for our reference. Subsequently, Dr. Trautmann gave his report, which was translated by Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Executive Yuan. The report was divided into the following points, summarizing the political situation in Germany: (1) The political situation in Germany before Hitler came to power; (2) The process by which Hitler came to power; (3) The content of the National Socialist Party led by Hitler, further divided into three aspects: nationalism, socialism, and ethnic nationalism, to clarify its meaning; (4) Foreign policy. Finally, he hoped that after this roundtable discussion, Sino-German friendship would become increasingly cordial, and he said that the report mainly concerned the political situation of Germany's recovery after the European War. He also hoped that China could achieve great success in its own recovery. When Dr. Trautmann reported on foreign policy, he stated that German diplomacy was aimed at maintaining world peace. No matter what kind of diplomatic issues arose, they were resolved peacefully because Hitler had said that resolving diplomatic issues by means of war was not worth the loss. Regarding the German people of Austria, a fraternal nation, they shared common feelings and concerns. After France returned Saar to Germany, Germany and France had reached a mutual understanding. Amicable relations with the Netherlands could also be gradually strengthened. Since the establishment of a maritime agreement with the UK, a new path had been embarked upon. Relations with Russia were more complicated, but Germany's eradication of the Communist Party was entirely an internal matter, the so-called "sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on your neighbor's roof." Russia should understand this point. The rest was not mentioned. After Dr. Trautmann finished his report, Cheng Zhonghang, Wei Tingsheng, and Chen Changheng raised questions about Germany's discrimination against the Jewish people and the conscription and management of markets. Dr. Trautmann answered all of them. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. Dr. Trautmann, his entourage, Chuan Bingchang, Ma Yinchu, Wu Jingxiong, He Sui, and the chairmen of the various committees went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to attend a banquet hosted by Sun Ke. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) German Ambassador Dr. Trautmann gave a speech at the National Legislative Yuan, first stating that after the European War, Germany had a multitude of political parties, and political power could not be developed. Under this kind of environment, as the saying goes, "a chaotic world produces heroes," and the savior Hitler emerged. The party program of the National Socialist Party under Hitler's leadership included: 1. Nationalism; 2. Socialism, seeking social understanding through national freedom and equality, used for labor-capital coordination. Hitler believed that internal stability was the basis for resisting external aggression, so he was determined to unify the whole country. Hitler said that lasting peace between countries depended on their own equality. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was because it treated Germany unfairly, such as the limitations on armaments, which weakened Germany's ability to defend itself. Dr. Trautmann continued that Hitler's acquisition of power was entirely through legal procedures, but it could also be said to have been somewhat revolutionary. Hitler not only opposed the Communist Party but also opposed the parliamentary system. The German government took the interests of all 66 million German people as its own. Absolute restrictions were placed on the freedom of a few reactionaries, because it was impossible to give freedom to reactionaries and allow them to endanger the country and the nation. This was also what Sun Yat-sen meant when he said that seeking freedom and equality for China was not seeking individual freedom and equality. Therefore, German politics went from a multiparty system to a one-party dictatorship, and from a one-party dictatorship to a one-man dictatorship. When the German elections were over, Hitler was elected with 90% of the vote. Hitler was still not satisfied and said that if Hitler obtained 100% approval, then the task of German national revival would be able to advance. As for the laborers under the current situation in Germany, although the same laws are enacted and courts are established, there are very few labor-capital lawsuits, because they are coordinated. Even if there are small problems, they are not handled by the courts, but by labor arbitration. Labor unions have been abolished and replaced by the Labor Grand Alliance, standing on the same front as the capitalists to seek progress in production. This is what Confucius called benevolence and forgiveness, and the so-called "when food and clothing are sufficient, people will know propriety and righteousness." The German labor movement is carried out under this principle. Germany is also making every effort to plan the revitalization of rural areas. At present, the value of agricultural products is determined by the government, and it is implemented uniformly throughout the country. There is no such thing as waiting for a price to sell. Market management is implemented so that farmers can have sufficient supplies. In addition, there is a system of ancestral fields, that is, landlords have a limit on the mortgage and sale of land. All farmers who sell their fields must retain 40 to 50 mu of basic land and are not allowed to sell it, in order to stabilize the livelihood of farmers, which is also the meaning of "the tiller owns his land." Its name is the ancestral field system. Dr. Trautmann then described Germany's conscription system, saying that it allowed the unemployed to solve their livelihood problems. Germany is currently deeply concerned about the tragic situation of war, where one general succeeds while ten thousand bones are left to rot. It hopes for world peace and that unemployment can be gradually reduced. Therefore, Germany is investing in the construction of highways and the expansion of industry to solve the unemployment problem. According to statistics from the year before last, there were 6 million unemployed people in Germany. Through these efforts and methods, there are now only over 1 million unemployed people. General observation believes that it is not a good way for Germany to borrow money to carry out reconstruction projects. At present, Germany's short-term public debt amounts to 5.5 billion marks, some of which have been converted into long-term public debt. However, on the one hand, calculating last year's tax revenue, it increased by about 1 billion marks compared with the previous year. From this point of view, this increase in tax revenue should be the result of reconstruction projects. At present, the paper money issued by Germany, up to this year, amounts to 3.8 billion. In 1934, foreign trade still had a large deficit. In summary, Germany's foreign policy is to maintain world peace. All kinds of pending issues are hoped to be resolved peacefully, because resorting to war, even if it wins, will not help in practice. Germany shares weal and woe with Austria, a fraternal nation. The German people will never forget this. After Saar was returned to Germany by France, there is a good possibility of promoting true friendship. It is believed that Poland can calmly resolve pending issues. As for the UK, since the naval agreement was signed, it has embarked on a new diplomatic path. As for Soviet Russia, although Germany opposes communism, Germany has decided to take the attitude of "sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on your neighbor's roof." All other issues are also aimed at peace, so there is no need to list them in detail. Finally, he wished China's reconstruction the greatest success. He then added that Germany does not have special discrimination against Jewish people. All Jewish people who served Germany during the war are still serving in the German government. He also said that under the conscription system, the government provides them with food and clothing, and pays them several yuan in salary in the first month. Your country's ambassador to Turkey, He Yaozu, recently visited Germany to observe the conscription system and said that China may promote it in the future. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

In addition, the Yuan's Commercial Law Committee and other committees held a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd to review and revise the trademark law, and invited officials from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to attend the meeting to provide explanations. As a result, the review must continue. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Disaster Victims Exempted from Participating in Huai River Project</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Huai River Conservancy Bureau previously ordered disaster victims in northern Jiangsu to participate in the Huai River project. Commissioner Shao, citing many difficulties, telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. The disaster victims are scattered in various districts, townships, and towns. Participating in the Huai River project would require a long journey, taking a long time, and would require the district and township chiefs to be stationed at the construction site for management, which would shake the original baojia organization, which is impossible. If the conscripted laborers were to form another baojia organization, management would be unreliable. This is one difficulty. Since the number of people is large, protection is difficult to provide. To prevent accidents, at least two companies of security guards must be stationed at the construction site for supervision. Tongfeng Pei Pi is known for its many bandits. Since the disaster in western Shandong, bandits have often infiltrated the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong. The strength of the security forces is already thin. If security forces are sent to the construction site, winter defense will be even more worrying. This is the second difficulty. The above are the most difficult of the difficulties. Can the association be requested to take responsibility for all management matters after the disaster victims arrive, and to issue a portion of the wages in advance to pay for resettlement? If this is not allowed, in order to provide relief to disaster victims and implement public works, there are also many projects in this area that should be undertaken. Chief Technician Yu is currently drafting a plan to reorganize the western dike of Weishan Lake and dredge the Bulao River to prevent water disasters, which is very important. Can it be reserved for public works in this area to avoid various difficulties and to allow the disaster victims to obtain real benefits? Time is pressing, so I telegraphed to request your examination and speedy instructions. The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied on the 2nd, stating that since there are difficulties for laborers from the disaster-stricken area of the district to participate in the Huai River project, they are exempted from participation. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The second phase of the project to divert the Huai River into the sea began on the morning of the 2nd. 80,000 laborers have now been recruited. 160,000 laborers will be recruited before the Mid-Autumn Festival to complete the 200-li long waterway as scheduled.

<h3>Xigong Banner Dispute: No Resolution Yet</h3>
<p>Bai Yunti and others suspend their trip</p>
<p>(Nanjing) De Liang and Wang San had another long telegram to Nanjing on the 3rd, describing the situation of the Xigong Banner dispute in the past few days and requesting the central government to take charge of the solution. The central government intends to send Yu Feipeng to mediate, but Yu declined modestly. When he will go is still difficult to determine. Wu Heling postponed his trip north to Miaopu for one or two days due to illness. Since Yun Ti, Ke Xing'e, and others were afraid that the Mongolian assembly would last too long and they would not be able to return in time to attend the Sixth Plenary Session, they decided to suspend their trip. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling, the head of the Mongolian League and Banner Office in Nanjing, received telegrams from Yun Wang and De Wang of the Mongolian Political Council on the 3rd, detailing the course of the dispute, the past misunderstandings of all parties on this issue, and the current situation, requesting Wu to present them to President Wang when he visits and explain them in detail. Wu has forwarded the original telegram to President Wang. According to Wu, he will go north with Yi Deqin on the 6th and will return to Nanjing in about two weeks. The central government intends to send Vice Minister Yu Feipeng to Mongolia to mediate. Yu is currently being modest. In another message, after repeated urging from the central government, Yu has agreed to go, and it may happen soon. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is still no solution to the Xigong Banner dispute. According to Bao Yueqing, it is hoped that the central government will quickly seek a good solution so that it can be resolved peacefully. I will go to Miaopu after Bai Yunti and Ke Xing'e come to Beiping for a brief contact, around the 9th or 10th of this month. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian told people that the two sides in the Xigong Banner dispute are still confronting each other, but there is no military action. Wang hopes that the situation will not escalate. As for the mediation methods, Chairman Huang and Minister He and others have discussed the results. After the candidates for the officials sent to investigate are decided, they can be brought along. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Martial law was lifted in Luan County City on the 3rd, and order has been restored. The cavalry battalion of Liu Lesan's unit was disarmed and reduced to a special service company under the direct jurisdiction of the first battalion, with 125 officers and soldiers.

<h3>Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Suspends Trip to Taiyuan</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters can be established in Xi'an in the near future. The organization is roughly the same as the former Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Its authority is to be responsible for commanding the troops of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang to suppress bandits within their borders. It is not accurate that it will command the bandit suppression forces of the seven provinces of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Moreover, because banditry in the Northwest is very deep, there is almost a combination of civilians and bandits. Therefore, political work is also very important. In the future, it will still be carried out based on the principle of 30% military and 70% political. The headquarters will also increase the establishment of a logistics station due to the inconvenient transportation in the Northwest to facilitate transportation and handle everything. Personnel for the headquarters will be transferred from various departments of the Xingying. Some personnel have been ordered to depart from Wuchang for Shaanxi. The name of the Xingying will still exist in the future, but the scope will be reduced, and a small number of personnel will be left to handle the pacification affairs in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui.

<p>(Beiping) The Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters is roughly the same in organization as the former Henan, Hubei, and Anhui three-province Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Due to the inconvenient transportation in the Northwest, only one more logistics station has been set up to facilitate transportation. The bandit suppression area under its jurisdiction is the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. All the officials of the department are transferred from the Xingying. Some of the officials have been ordered to leave Wuchang for Shaanxi to prepare everything. It is expected to be established soon. In the future, it will still be based on the principle of 70% political and 30% military of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to work hard to suppress the bandits. It is heard that except for the personnel of the Army Reorganization Office of the Xingying, the personnel of the other departments will not be replenished after they are transferred. The rumor that the Xingying will be closed down is not yet the time. Because the Red Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have gradually been eliminated, but the pacification work has not yet been completed. Therefore, the main task in the future is to focus on pacification matters, and the organizational scope will be reduced accordingly. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Ceremony for the Establishment of the Philippine Autonomous Government</h3>
<p>Only Consuls from Various Countries in Manila Invited to Participate</p>
<p>(Washington) A State Department official issued a statement today regarding the Manila telegram stating that the US government did not approve of inviting foreign officials to participate in the Philippine autonomous government establishment ceremony, believing that it would be inappropriate to invite a portion of foreign representatives to participate in the ceremony. However, when the Philippine independent government is established, representatives from various countries will naturally be invited to participate. This move would place a huge financial burden on foreign and Philippine governments. However, the State Department has approved inviting consuls from various countries in Manila.

<p>Dedicated Articles</p>
<h3>Criticism of Yan Xishan's Land Village Ownership</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Xishan, seeing the spread of the Red Peril, has generously announced a fundamental anti-communist plan, advocating land village ownership. His understanding and courage are truly admirable. In recent years, the central authorities and people in society have expressed that anti-communism must focus on cleaning up politics and economic transformation, but until now, they have not dared to have a clear reform plan, let alone explicitly say that the current land problem is the main reason for the prevalence of communist disasters. Mr. Yan, in his capacity as a local authority, from his years of political experience, can recognize the crux of the problem, and express his fundamental change to the existing social structure and economic foundation. His decisiveness is truly amazing.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Yan's proposed principles and methods are too general. From a scientific standpoint, we dare not blindly agree.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's advocated land village ownership is similar to the Equal-field system (均田制) and Allotment system (口分制) of the Northern Wei, Sui, and Tang Dynasties in our country, and the Cultivated Field System (研田制) after the Taika Reform in Japan. This system also has some value in a purely agricultural society with vast land and sparse population, because it can break the boundaries of inequality and achieve the effect of equal wealth. However, the reason why the Equal-field system and Allotment system of ancient China and the Handen System of Japan eventually collapsed is that the harmony between man and land is extremely difficult, the continuation of management and control is too complicated, and the more advanced agricultural management and more complex social organizations of modern times do not allow its existence. Mr. Yan has forgotten historical facts and is still advocating this kind of medieval method today. Although his intentions are not to be criticized, it is ultimately not enough to be a land policy suitable for our country today.</p>
<p>Judging from Mr. Yan's outline of land village ownership methods, its main points can be divided into the following five points: (1) Land is taken over by the village with public bonds; (2) According to the nature of the land, it is divided into various unit areas and distributed to farmers for cultivation; (3) Farmers receive land and return land at the beginning and end of their cultivation age; (4) Immigrants regulate wide and narrow villages; (5) Various direct taxes are used to repay public bonds for buying land. Now, please discuss these five points separately.</p>
<p>(1) How the land is taken over by the village is not discussed for now, and how the advantages and disadvantages of land village ownership and private ownership are different has the value of discussion. In primitive societies, both in China and abroad, land belongs to the blood-related group of the village. Descending to the present day, both in China and abroad, a private ownership system must be produced on the land, because human habits and social institutions make it inevitable. Although human beings are the spirit of animals, they are still one of the animals. The selfishness of animals has not disappeared in human beings so far. The normal development of selfishness is to seek the full, appropriate, and happy survival and the maximum display and continuation of vitality under the condition of not hindering the survival of others. Therefore, human beings began to store civilization and have society. The root of all civilization cannot but be based on the development of human self-consciousness. Therefore, some people call the concept of ownership a great invention of human society, because with the concept of ownership, there is the concept of economy, so human beings can start to work diligently and with hard work to seek their livelihood. If one person's strength is insufficient, the family's strength is used to do it. If one person's body is insufficient, the strength of sons and grandsons is used to do it. Therefore, human beings are increasingly breeding and becoming rich. Human society can exist and develop. The reason why the concept of private ownership is criticized is that it is overdeveloped, and eventually harms the public for private gain and harms the lives of the public for the benefit of one person. If we can correct public and private affairs and use a more perfect and thorough system to prevent its malpractices, then we can decisively judge that private ownership is better than public ownership under today's civilization process. This theory is true in other aspects, and there is an undeniable truth in terms of the land system, because the natural habit of land requires human blood to cultivate before it can be developed and promoted. The more dedicated and loving people are to the land, the greater its productive capacity should be. Intensive management all originates from the small farmer self-cultivation system, while nomadic systems and large landlord systems, or bad tenant farming systems, result in a weak relationship between land and people, and a lack of love. The productivity of the land is obviously reduced. The collective management advocated today, although has a solid basis in management skills, is ultimately difficult to hope for universality, because the love between people and land is not as deep as private ownership. Therefore, in terms of land management, the consciousness of village ownership is ultimately not as beneficial as the consciousness of private ownership.</p>
<p>In modern times, the nature of land has been financialized, and exchange, trade, gift, and inheritance can all represent its value as a unit. The establishment of this land price is the main reason for the evolution of modern village economy into a national economy. All the inherent properties of land, and the labor and capital invested by humans, can be expressed in a uniform monetary unit nationwide. Therefore, land has general economic properties, and humans can individually increase or decrease the land they own at any time according to their living needs and cultivation ability. Looking at Mr. Yan's method, although the land is still paid for by private management, it is advocated to be owned by the village, then the land must be prohibited from buying and selling transactions, then not only the economic properties of the land are completely lost, but the people cannot control it according to their needs. In the end, it is what is called using people to sacrifice the land, and using the land to tie people's lives. The serfdom of the Middle Ages will be revived. Regardless of whether it cannot be tolerated by the recent economic system, it is also not permitted by the facts of today's human society. Today, human life and death are uncertain, gathering and dispersal are impermanent, and cultivation ability varies due to old age and disease. How can we ensure that the continuously increasing population can obtain the land it deserves? How can we take the surplus to compensate for the deficiency and make the cultivation ability and the amount of land suitable? These are all great difficulties in fact. The land allotment of the Tang Dynasty and the handen system of Japan could not prohibit the people from privately receiving and selling each other, and as a result, they returned to private ownership. This is the main reason. Therefore, to carry out state operation by state ownership, learning from Soviet Russia, although the benefit of land financialization is lost, it can still be forcibly argued. Now, to talk about village ownership and pay for private management is definitely a contradictory theory. This is because, in terms of land economy, village ownership is not as good as a perfect private ownership system.</p>
<p>Other problems, such as the instability of the village unit, the difficulty of village ownership management, and the many malpractices of the method of buying with public bonds, are the last details of the problem, so they will be abandoned and not discussed.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Yan's ideal is that the land can be divided into units according to the various qualities and the farming capacity of one person. Mr. Guan does not know that the quality of the land, its water, drought, fertility, and barrenness, varies greatly, and the farming capacity of one person is also extremely difficult to estimate. Mr. Yan's intention is probably to seek a calculation method in general, without seeking its accuracy and fairness. However, how can this be said to be a national policy? All legislation must seek its precision and fairness, and then the world will obey, and the officials will have no way to manipulate the situation. If the legislation itself is already unfair, then the trend of the situation will inevitably lead to the world being restless. Mr. Yan also said that there will be great differences between villages due to the size of the scope, the number of people, and the fertility of the land. He forcibly explained it by saying, "People's pursuit of life is like water flowing downwards. Although the boundaries of the village are fixed, the residence and migration of people are originally free. One is fixed, and the other is active. Even if there is unfairness, it can naturally tend to be fair." Alas, how can this theory convince the world? If the villagers are allowed to freely migrate to seek a living, then the areas with fertile land, convenient transportation, and rich production in the world will flock to them like ducks. The occurrence of chaos will be immediate. If the villagers are content with their homeland and do not want to move, and would rather die old in their hometown, forcibly seeking a share in the area where they grew up, what method will Mr. Yan use to drive them like water flowing downwards? If the people can be like water flowing downwards and naturally tend to be fair, then the theory of wide and narrow villages will not arise when the Equal-field system is implemented, and the matter of doubling the fields in wide villages and halving them in narrow villages should not be seen in the records. This proposal is not only divided into different units, but the unfairness at the time of the initial distribution is especially serious. Even if it is occasionally implemented, it will inevitably lead to hundreds of malpractices, and the unfairness will become more and more severe, and it will eventually lead to the fate of natural abolition.</p>
<p>(3) Accepting and returning land, its spiritual defect is that the consciousness of private ownership is not established, making people's love for land weak, management is not dedicated, and production is reduced, as mentioned above, and the practical difficulty is that the procedures for accepting and returning are extremely complicated. If the household registration is lost, fraud will occur, because people have life and death, sharks move, and households have marriages, divisions, and combinations. Now, if we count the mouth and give land, and determine the acceptance and return according to age, then the ancient Tuanmao system has seen its end, and the current Baojia system is not enough. It is necessary for the European personnel registration system to be strictly enforced in poor and remote areas before the method of acceptance and return can be realized, but this is only the beginning. The population is increasingly breeding, there are few who return the land, and there are many who are waiting to be granted land. What will happen then? Mr. Yan's relief method is that the village office can re-divide according to the increase in population, but I do not know where the dispute of re-dividing the whole will go. After the re-division, the unfairness between this village and that village will be even more serious. Moreover, the second weight will come soon. Such a layer-by-layer re-division will lead to the disaster of fragmented land division without end, and the difficulty will never be broken through.</p>
<p>Today's agricultural population in China accounts for 80% of the total population, which has exceeded the proper percentage. If the national economy has the hope of recovery in the future, then the agricultural population must be gradually reduced, and the industrial population must increase day by day. Mr. Yan's theory is just the opposite, and will make everyone farmers, because the land village ownership system, although it does not force everyone to be farmers, but because farmers can get a share, which is more advantageous than being other entrepreneurs, with no basis at all and having to rely on their own efforts. The difficulty is not the same, who would not give up the difficult and seek the easy? Why not first have this share to seek a living? Therefore, even in terms of the entire national economy, Mr. Yan's theory is not acceptable.</p>
<p>(4) Immigration to regulate wide and narrow villages is not the main body of this method, but an incidental provision to help those who are poor in this method. However, in terms of immigration, it is also not easy. Being content with one's homeland and placing importance on migration is the habit of farmers. In one word of migration, the state does not know how much force it will have to spend before it can engage in it. After the migration, whether their living habits and farming skills are up to the standard is still unknown. In terms of the village conditions in our country, most of them live together as a clan. Moving people of clan A and living in the village of clan B is also not something that people can integrate without hindrance. From the central and southeastern provinces of our country, the population density between counties is not far apart, and it is extremely difficult to regulate wide and narrow villages. According to the results of various surveys in recent times, such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hunan and Hubei, all feel the lack of land. If the number of farmers is used to divide the land equally, there is still not enough two or three acres. How can we allocate shares according to farming ability? If we seek regulation in remote areas, whether the country has such strength today to carry out large-scale immigration is a big question. Moving people from the southeast to the remote areas, in terms of the current national treasury, is a problem that cannot be done. Therefore, this proposal is also only enough for reference, and not a valid method.</p>
<p>(5) Buying land with public bonds and repaying the principal in installments with the income from various direct taxes, the disadvantage lies in the credibility of the public bonds, which is irrelevant to land policy, so it will not be discussed for the time being. The disadvantage of the tax being added to the farmers themselves is that it harms the soundness of the policy itself, so we cannot but say a word about it. Land village ownership and granting land according to the mouth, and the result will inevitably lead to a uniform burden, which is a theoretical fact. According to Mr. Yan's proposal, the farmers will have to pay 10% of the tax in the future (10% of the harvest). This is several times higher than the current land tax, because the cost of agricultural management, seeds, cattle, fertilizer, agricultural tools, and other necessary capital usually accounts for 30% to 40% of the harvest. The cost of food and clothing throughout the year is only 60% to 70% of the harvest. Now, taking one of them again, it does not seem to be heavy at first glance, but after detailed calculation, we know that it is an unbearable burden. Mr. Wan Guoding, in his book "The History of the Chinese Land System", cited a section on the Equal-field system and fleeing households as evidence, "The Equal-field system equally distributes land to the people, but the most fleeing households are in the Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties that implemented the Equal-field system. Is it that the people do not like to have land? No, the Han Dynasty did not grant people land, but levied taxes according to the mu, so the household tax was lighter. Since the Equal-field system was implemented, the land rent was also collected according to the household, so the household tax increased greatly. However, the acceptance and granting of land only happened when the politics was clear and there were more land and fewer people. It was only temporary when it was followed, and there were many times when it was nominal. Powerful people annexed land, and the poor and weak lost their way. The officials no longer granted land, but the tax that was levied could no longer be lightened. The heavy tax became a disease for the people, and they fled together, not because they hated having land, but because they fled the heavy tax. Therefore, the poor and weak were harmed in the name of granting land... Therefore, whether the Equal-field system is better for the people's livelihood than the Han or Song and Ming Dynasties is truly a question." This kind of opinion of knowledgeable people, and I have the same feeling about the system advocated by Mr. Yan. As for the trouble of collecting this kind of tax in kind, the loss, and the gains and losses in the national finance, there is no need to discuss them deeply.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of Mr. Yan's land public ownership method are roughly discussed in this way. Since the method itself has many obstacles and is difficult to be perfect, what is its anti-communist strength? It does not need to be judged. Moreover, it may be because it is drawing a tiger like a dog, which may arouse the people's communist consciousness, and there is no reasonable method to produce it. The Communist Party takes advantage of the interests and can take the opportunity to do harm. Is the communist land distribution movement in Jiangxi Province not similar to Mr. Yan's system? Therefore, we cannot but hope that Mr. Yan will be cautious in making a decision.</p>
<p>Today's land policy in China is best at the equalization of land rights advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. I have repeatedly discussed it. His method is not only suitable for today's national conditions, but also in line with the future trend of the world. It does not abolish the benefits of private ownership, but can remove the abuses of private ownership. It does not take the name of public ownership, but can have the reality of public ownership. The law is simple and easy to understand, easy to implement and without malpractices. Unfortunately, the people of the country either cling to the status quo and are unwilling to believe in the price and follow it, or they like to talk high and make other proposals to seek fame and shock the world. They either regard the equalization of land rights as empty theory or regard it as mediocre and unremarkable, misleading the common people, which is a great sigh. Is there a magic method to prevent communism today? Yes, there is only to take the theory of equalization of land rights and believe in it and implement it vigorously. Not only is it to prevent communism, but also the great fortune of the entire economic transformation and national revival will be predicted from this.</p>
<p>The Reaction to the Connection of the Songjiang Intercity Road</p>
<p>The county road from Songjiang to Sijing in this county was previously handed over by the county government to the Shangsong Motor Company to build with advance funds, and the project has been completed and opened to traffic. However, recently, the plan to connect the north gate of the Songsi Road with the east gate of the Songhui Road is about to be realized. The houses and graves along the route are being demolished by the county magistrate. The local people say that the Dongmen Main Street is also on the list of expansion. If it is implemented, the city will be divided into two, and transportation and commerce will be affected. The people went to the county to petition a few days ago, but did not get a result. So they sent representatives Zhu Jiuwang and others to Beijing to petition the fellow villagers association in Beijing, asking them to preside over the matter. It is reported that the association has telegraphed the provincial government, saying, "According to Songjiang citizens Zhu Jiuwang and others, the original route of the Songsi Road was originally planned to end at the North Gate, but the motor company that contracted the road has designated the route to extend to the East Gate, causing a lot of damage to the people's houses and graves along the way. They have submitted petitions to the provincial government and the county government, asking for a ban, but have not received a reply. The company has recently started construction without authorization and forcibly demolished and moved. Please save them. It is believed that road construction should take into account both transportation and economy, and should maintain the original plan and stop the expansion. If the road really needs to be extended, the damage suffered by each owner should be evaluated and compensated by the local public group before construction can begin to show fairness. The righteousness is related to the hometown, and it is urgently transferred." "The following is omitted" Another telegram to County Magistrate Jin of the county government said, "The case of the Songsi Road extending to the East Gate has not been agreed upon by the people. A letter is being sent to local people and this association has sent separate telegrams to the provincial government. Before a proper solution is obtained, you should handle it with caution."</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>The Dispute Over the Silk Cocoon Detention Case in Xushe</p>
<p>The Wuxi Dacheng Silk Factory received more than 500 dry cocoons from the Guanxing Renter in this year's autumn cocoons, loaded them on ships and transported them to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, in Xushe, Jiang Rujing and others gathered the villagers by striking gongs, saying that the factory cut off the market, suppressed the cocoons, and forced the farmers, and detained all four ships of dry cocoons. At that time, the factory reported to the Wuxi Silk Factory Association and forwarded it to the Chamber of Commerce, and telegraphed the provincial government and the two halls of civil construction, requesting that security teams be sent to the township to suppress and escort the cocoon ships back to Wuxi. Chairman Chen and Ministers Yu and Shen of the civil affairs hall and construction hall successively ordered the magistrates of Yixing and Liyang counties to investigate the truth and quickly resolve it. However, it has been almost ten days now, and the cocoon ships are still detained. Zhang Jifang, the manager of the Dacheng Silk Factory, sent Ding to Yixing to contact the various parties, but did not get any results. The district heads of all districts in Yixing County jointly submitted a petition to the county government, appealing for the farmers, accusing the cocoon merchants of suppressing the cocoons and requesting strict punishment for the fraudulent acts to avoid the pain of exploitation of the farmers. The dispute is becoming more and more serious. The Yongtai Silk Factory received the autumn cocoons in Liyang this time, and the price was around 20 yuan. At the same time, the price in Daibu was about 27 yuan. The villagers thought that the price difference was too large, and that the price was deliberately suppressed, so they detained the cocoon ships and refused to release them. The stalemate is still unresolved.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongwei</p>
<p>When Cheng Tang dissolved the nets, living beings flourished; when Confucius kept away from the kitchen, the benevolent loathed killing. Thus, they showed that all beings are one and should not harm each other. When people have murderous thoughts, it is the beginning of disaster. To eliminate disaster, the only way is to stop killing. Moreover, the world is now full of difficulties, and the situation is changing. The coming of the great disaster is especially frightening. Therefore, this association convened a publicity conference on the day of the World Animal Day, and also held a membership recruitment to hope that benevolent people will come together and work together to promote the movement. We sincerely hope that gentlemen of the country will extend their love to all beings and make their benevolence widespread. We cannot express enough our heartfelt prayers.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between the Animal Protection Association and the International Community</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>Since the British Parliament passed the Animal Protection Act in 1822, for a hundred years, the kindness of animal protection has spread throughout the world, whether it is the United States, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia, Japan, or other countries. All the fallacies of using animals by nature have gradually lost credibility, and even those who have always despised animals have gradually expressed sympathy. Truly, the compassionate people are all the same, and the former saints and sages are the same. Our country was the earliest to be civilized, and its politics was based on leniency, and its customs were based on benevolence and righteousness. It has always been known for its morality. Even for animals, although the Song Dynasty could not completely ban slaughter, it also had considerable restrictions, such as Tang opening the nets and Confucius fishing without nets and shooting without killing. Mencius heard the sound and could not bear to eat the meat, and the emperor did not kill cattle without reason, the doctor did not kill sheep without reason, and the scholar did not kill pigs without reason. They were all set as rituals. It is known that the ancient sages and sages of our country, although restricted by the circumstances of the times, did not completely equalize all aspects like the Buddhists. However, their bitter heart to kill less is better than killing more, and to gradually reach the inability to kill is clearly revealed. However, in recent times, most scholars are only dazzled by the alarming theory of Darwin's struggle for survival and natural selection, without deeply studying the supreme principle of animal protection that people in the world have recently vigorously promoted. They pick up their spit and abandon their essence. Not to mention the inherent benevolence and beautiful virtues of our country, everything has a downward trend that cannot be recovered. Even in terms of international trends, in this time when the world hates killing and advocates extending kindness to all beings in order to restore the disaster and eliminate war, we alone ignore it and do not protect animals because they are weak and can be bullied. Is it not violating the trend of the national team, falling into isolation, and making people criticize us as a nation that fears the strong and bullies the weak, and is barbaric and cruel? Recognizing this, the associates have established the Chinese Animal Protection Association in order to reduce the suffering of all animals, transform the fierce atmosphere of grievances into auspicious aura, and at the same time cultivate the virtues of the people of the country, restore the inherent civilization, and cooperate with the benevolent and kind people of all friendly countries. The boundaries of people have disappeared, and the boundaries of nations have naturally disappeared. Using this to seek the great unity of the world and gradually reach the supreme rule of moderation and growth, this will not only be the fortune of the animal kingdom, but also the gospel of all mankind. Alas, the five turbid rivers are deep, and there is pain of sinking in the heart; the karma of sentient beings is heavy, and there is no clear shining in the nature. Protecting animals is also the essential effort to protect our heart and nature. Even the powers that have always embraced imperialism have recognized the crisis in the world and have this kind and gentle act of cultivating the mind. Our country has always emphasized benevolence and righteousness, but it is the opposite. Is it not a great shame? Alas; it can be revived.</p>
<h3>Brief Description of Association Affairs in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Guan Jiongzhi</p>
<p>Since the association's proposal for preparation to its establishment, it has been two and a half years. The initial work was reported selectively at the Animal Festival last year. In the recent year, thanks to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life and all members, the various tasks of the association have not been slightly stagnant due to the prevalence of disasters and the insecurity of society. After all, disaster relief and resettlement of refugees are temporary measures, while promoting love and correcting people's hearts are the way to govern. Therefore, we have increased our efforts and are determined to proceed. Now, we will briefly describe the affairs of the past year separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Organization My country has a vast territory, and the situations in various places are quite different. It is inevitable that there will be regrets that the whip is beyond reach if we want to promote the cause of protecting life. Therefore, according to the planned plan, we have widely established branches. Those that have been formally established include Xi'an and Xijing (Chang'an) in Shaanxi Province, and those that are being prepared include Beijing, Changsha, Suzhou, Rugao, and Dongtai. It is estimated that they will be established in order soon. At the same time, in order to consolidate the strength of the association, we will start recruiting members today to gather ideas and benefit from each other, and work together.</p>
<p>(2) Propaganda The wind of cruelty in recent human beings has become a deep-rooted phenomenon, which is enough to hinder the promotion of the cause of protecting life. Therefore, the association's propaganda matters must strive for universality in order to arouse the attention of people from all walks of life. In the spring of this year, we negotiated with the Xinwen newspaper to publish a special issue on Protecting Life. Currently, three issues have been published, and we will continue to do so in the future. In July of the summer, the association printed 10,000 Protecting Life paper fans in response to the needs of the times and distributed them to people in this city, which was warmly welcomed by all walks of life and was exhausted within ten days. From April 8th to 13th of this year's Animal Week, the association assisted the Local Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (established by Westerners) to collect more than 2,000 animal protection paintings from children in various primary and secondary schools in this city and held an exhibition, which also gave the citizens a deep impression.</p>
<p>(3) Career In view of the pollution of the pond water on the Jiuqu Bridge in the Town God's Temple in this city, and the fact that many fish died, the association, in March of the spring, worked with the municipal authorities to set up pumps to remove the sewage and replace it with clean water. Small fish were also eaten by fish and turtles every day, and methods were devised to extract them and release them separately. At this year's Animal Festival, the association telegraphed the Ministry of Interior in advance to order all provinces and cities across the country to ban slaughter for one day in order to promote the protection of life, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. In addition, according to reports from members and people from all over the country, we appealed to local governments to ban the killing and eating of cattle and field chickens, and to stop the killing of wild dogs, the slaughter of pregnant sheep, and the upside-down of chickens, etc., all of which were handled separately.</p>
<p>The above are all major points. In addition, there are many matters to be handled, and we still need to proceed step by step. As for future plans, we have decided to set up animal treatment centers and organize burial teams in the near future in order to reduce animal suffering and maintain hygiene. We sincerely hope that benevolent people at home and abroad will give us guidance and support us with strength so that we can see its success as soon as possible, which is not only the fortune of animals.</p>
<h3>Protective Words on Animals</h3>
<p>— Shuang Yan</p>
<p>Today is Animal Day, designated by various countries around the world. The Animal Protection Society of this city has published this special issue to make everyone understand the meaning of animal protection. When this special issue was being edited, the editor-in-chief asked me for a contribution, and I couldn't refuse. So I wrote what I could say below.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Yuan Jianzhai having a few words, saying that heaven produces living things to provide for people's mouths and stomachs. We humans slaughter and cut them up, wanting them to die is permissible. But to want them to die and yet make it impossible for them to seek death, that is not permissible. This is a level below what Mencius said, "Seeing them alive, one cannot bear to see them die; hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh." But it still does not lose the benevolence in a person's heart. It would be great if we could avoid killing living things altogether. If we cannot, we should still not lose this benevolent heart. How can we subject animals to ropes and chains, whip them, and make them grieve and wail, making it impossible for them to seek death?</p>
<p>Buddhism prohibits killing, which is a benevolent heart. This benevolent heart is the same throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Extending it to benevolence towards people and love for things, this heart is invariably the same. Humans are born between heaven and earth and are no different from other animals. Therefore, treat both self and others equally. One who can love animals can love people. Otherwise, destroying one's own kind is merely the same as having a cruel heart. Therefore, those who whip animals, kill to satisfy their appetite, drive people, seize land for private gain, and force them onto the chopping block and into boiling cauldrons, amidst the flames of cannons and aircraft, are all evil demons of the world.</p>
<p>If people were subjected to imprisonment, the torture and cruel punishments of prison guards, and all kinds of cruelties, they would invariably cry out to heaven and find no way to enter the earth, filled with grievances and anger, longing for death but unable to attain it. At this time, if you reflect on other animals, suffering innocent whippings, tight bindings, and pain, your heart should also feel desolate and pity them.</p>
<h3>The Words of Animals</h3>
<p>— Shu Chu</p>
<p>Besides all plants in the world, there is the world of animals. Human beings are a part of the animal world, which is recognized by everyone. The words of humans can also be said to be the words of animals, so I use these four words as the title of my article.</p>
<p>I saw in a newspaper report that Dr. ×× of × country used a certain live animal for medical experiments, performing live dissections. Also, Dr. ×× injected poison into the limbs of a certain live animal to cause changes in the venom and make discoveries. If you ask him why he used live animals for experiments, he would undoubtedly answer that it's because the physiology of animals is the same as that of humans. Then I can't help but ask him, aren't your children the same as animals? Why don't you use your children for dissection or experiments? It can be seen that humans are indeed the most cruel and selfish of animals.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Shen Shiwan, for the purpose of protecting animals, talked to me about abstaining from meat and fish, which is indeed of considerable benefit to the body and mind. People who love to eat fish and shrimp harm hundreds and thousands of lives with each meal. It is better for a hundred or so people to share a cow. I couldn't help but retort that, in terms of minimizing the taking of life, it is indeed slightly better for a hundred or so people to share a cow. However, the cow has toiled for people in farming, and it can be said that it has nourished the lives of a hundred or so people. Not repaying its kindness is already unfeeling. Now, eating its flesh makes humans an unbearably cruel animal. If one were to seek such behavior in other dull animals, I'm afraid they wouldn't be found. Mr. Shen lowered his head and remained silent for a long time after hearing this.</p>

<h3>Continued Repayment of Train Purchase Advance by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway owed the Sino-British Bank over 117,000 yuan for the purchase of trains. In September of this year, it was due to repay £9,000. The accounting office settled the telegraphic transfer rate with Old Zhongyong Foreign Firm on September 13th, converting one shilling six and sixteen-sevenths pence into one yuan, totaling 117,152.54 yuan.

<h3>Request to Refund Import Tax on Artificial Silk Rejected by the Ministry of Finance – Due to Connection with Domestic Silk Industry Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Guild previously noted that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry were planning to follow the example of European and American countries by refunding a portion of the raw material tax within a possible range for goods sold overseas if the raw materials were purchased from overseas and the import tax rate was indeed too high, in order to encourage competition with foreign goods. The guild believed that China's silk industry had been popular worldwide. Since the import of artificial silk, it has been widely used due to its special effect of being dyed in two colors, and sales have been smooth. However, the import tax is very heavy. In order to reduce costs and expand the market, the guild specifically requested the Ministry of Finance to refund the import tax on artificial silk. The Ministry replied that it was related to the relief of the domestic silk industry and could not be approved. The Ministry replied to the guild, stating that the request to refund the import tax on artificial silk was related to the relief of the domestic silk industry and could not be approved. The reply was issued on September 27th, 24th year, by Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>

<h3>Municipal Downtown Railway - Scheduled to Open on Double Tenth Day - Interconnecting Train Arrangement Determined - Fares Specially Reduced for National Games Service</h3>
<p>The two Railway Bureau's municipal downtown railway (i.e., the Sanmin Branch Line) has been completed. After satisfactory trial runs, it will open on Double Tenth Day due to the Sixth National Games being held in the downtown area on that day. An arrangement for interconnecting trains, as well as timetables and fares, has been determined. Special trains will be operated on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Line and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Line. Details regarding the branch line are as follows:</p>
<p>Operating Procedures: The Sanmin Branch Line connects to the Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) Branch Line at the 6.5-kilometer mark. All operating equipment for the Sanmin Branch Line will be installed before Double Tenth Day. Temporary operating procedures for the interconnecting trains of the Sanmin Branch Line and the Songhu Branch Line have been established by the Traffic Department as follows: (1) At the connection point of the Minlu Branch Line and the Songhu Branch Line at the 6.5-kilometer mark, a temporary station will be established, tentatively named "Sanmin Road Junction Station." At the terminal of the Minlu Branch Line, a temporary station will be established, tentatively named "Sanmin Road Station." (2) When trains operate between Baoshan Road and Sanmin Road, the existing electrical road tokens and copper-iron road token system between Jiangwan Station and Gaojingmiao Station will be temporarily suspended. All trains traveling between Jiangwan Station and Sanmin Road Junction Station, between Minlu Road Junction Station and Gaojingmiao Station, and between Minlu Road Junction Station and Minlu Road Station, will use the copper-iron road token system, handled in accordance with the regulations of the operating rules. (3) The temporary copper-iron road tokens mentioned in the preceding article, for each section, shall be sealed and kept by the Jiangwan Stationmaster before use and after suspension of use. (4) The Sanmin Road Junction Stationmaster, taking the first Sanmin Road Branch Line train each day, shall proceed to the post. When passing Jiangwan, the stationmaster shall sign to the Jiangwan Stationmaster to receive all the copper-iron road tokens for the section between Sanmin Road Junction Station and Gaojingmiao Station, all the copper-iron tokens for the section between Sanmin Road Junction Station and Minlu Road Station, and the switch key of Sanmin Road Station. (5) The Minlu Junction Stationmaster, taking the last train of the Sanmin Road Branch Line back to Shanghai each day, shall properly lock the switch plate away from the Songhu Branch Line, extinguish all oil lamps, properly hand over the station equipment and sundries to the railway police for safekeeping, and carry:</p>
<p>the copper-iron road tokens for the section between Minlu Road Junction Station and Sanmin Road Station, and between Gaojingmiao Station and Minlu Junction Station, along with the switch key, and deliver them to the Jiangwan Stationmaster for inspection and receipt. He shall also obtain a receipt from the Jiangwan Stationmaster as proof before leaving the post. (6) The Jiangwan Stationmaster shall be responsible for telegrahically notifying related parties of the time and train number for each section to begin using the copper-iron road token system, as well as the time and train number to resume the electrical road token system, and report a copy to the Traffic Department Director and the Su-Song Section Traffic Section Chief. (7) After the Jiangwan Stationmaster properly hands over all the copper-iron road tokens for the section between Minlu Road Junction Station and Gaojingmiao Station, and between Sanmin Road Junction Station and Sanmin Road Station, and the switch key of the Sanmin Road Junction Station, to the Second Minlu Road Junction Stationmaster, he shall immediately telegraph notice to change to the copper-iron road token system. After receiving back all the copper-iron road tokens and the switch key of the Sanmin Road Junction Station, and verifying them without error, he may send a telegraph notice to restore the electrical road token system between Jiangwan Station and Gaojingmiao Station. (8) During the time that the Songhu Main Line and the Sanmin Road Branch Line have interconnecting trains, all trains passing through the Sanmin Road Junction Station must exchange road tokens or road signs. (9) Before the installation of the in-and-out station signals and switch signs of the Minlu Road Junction Station and the Sanmin Road Station, when trains approach each station, they must sound the whistle, reduce speed, and follow the hand signals shown by each station. (10) Since the Sanmin Road Junction Station does not have a passing track, during the time when the Songhu Branch Line and the Sanmin Road Branch Line have interconnecting trains, when trains travel from Jiangwan Station to Gaojingmiao Station, or from Gaojingmiao Station to Jiangwan Station, before entering the section, the Jiangfeng Station, Sanmin Road Junction Station, and Gaojingmiao Station stationmasters shall notify and consult each other, ensuring safety and punctuality.</p>

If there are any errors, the Bureau shall be responsible if the cause lies with the Bureau, and the Bank shall be responsible if the cause lies with the Bank. If a borrower leaves the job or is unable to continue service, and the amount owed to the Bank has not yet been repaid, the Bureau's accounting department shall be responsible for first deducting the amount owed from the borrower's remaining funds held by the Bureau, such as salary, savings, and other due payments.

<h3>Balloon Advertising Not Allowed by the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>In recent times, commercial competition relies on promotion, and advertising methods are changing with each passing day. Recently, a foreigner named Sparks proposed to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to launch a balloon advertising business in Shanghai and requested the approval of the Public Works Department. This matter was discussed by the Garrison Committee some time ago. It was generally believed that this novel advertisement was dangerous and had many drawbacks. It was feared that the balloon would leak gas and catch fire in the downtown area, or even explode, thereby endangering buildings and property on the ground, and that it would easily come into contact with electrical wires, causing all kinds of accidents. Moreover, when the balloon is stationed in the sky, passers-by and drivers would often stop to look up, their minds scattered, which could easily cause accidents. It was also felt that it would be difficult to approve. Moreover, a similar proposal was made to the committee in mid-November last year, but it was not approved. Now that the old case has been brought up again, the nature is similar, and there is really no room for discussion. Therefore, this novel advertising technique was not approved by the Public Works Department and will not be seen by the people of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Cai, Director of Public Security Bureau, Issues Order to Strictly Arrest Robbers in Post Office Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has recently issued a special order to the sub-bureaus and teams under his jurisdiction regarding the major robbery case at the Postal Administration (Order No. Zhengzi 3505): "According to a public letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Executive Committee based on a petition from the Postal Workers' Union, it was found that the Shanghai Postal Administration was robbed by several bandits at around 10:00 am on the 9th of this month. More than 91,000 yuan, which the post office was about to load into a car and transport to the Savings and Remittance Bureau on Fuzhou Road, was swept away. One clerk was shot and killed, and two guards were killed and one wounded. Such a major robbery has shocked the union members. The post office is an important place for office work, so ten patrolmen from the Public Security Bureau are stationed there daily for security. However, the stationed patrolmen are incompetent, slack in prevention, allowing the bandits to mix in. Moreover, when the guards were fighting with the bandits, the stationed patrolmen all hid and refused to resist, which is even more dereliction of duty. Now that this case has been going on for more than ten days, the perpetrators are still at large and have not been arrested, which will cause the citizens to have doubts about the city's security in the future. The union members serve the postal service and are very concerned about this case. They are dissatisfied with the police authorities' lack of prevention, lack of courage to resist, and inability to arrest the perpetrators. The first executive meeting of the union has resolved to petition the head office to transfer to the Public Security Bureau to solve the case within a time limit to uphold the law and order and restore security, etc. Based on this, the case involves robbery and homicide, and it is appropriate to send a letter to your bureau to instruct your subordinates to strictly arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice."</p>

<h3>Increased Telephone Fees</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Users Voice Opposition in Unison. Expert General Report Largely Completed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's request to increase telephone fees has been studied by the Telephone Expert Committee, and the general report is now being compiled. Yesterday, the Public Works Department held a board meeting. Because the report has not yet been completed, the issue was not discussed. However, it is understood that the general report will be completed within a few days and submitted to the board of directors. The board of directors will then forward it to the Public Utility Committee for discussion. After a result is planned, it will be submitted to the board of directors for approval. Therefore, the submission of the Telephone Expert Committee's general report will still take some time. The majority of the general report has been drafted and completed. Although the per-call billing layer has not been completely decided, the attitudes of the British and American experts are converging, so the principle of per-call billing will definitely be adopted. Due to the depression of all industries and the increasingly sluggish market conditions, the city's users have long firmly opposed it. The Japanese residents of this city have also expressed their opposition to the per-call billing issue due to the decline in social economy.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports: According to British telephone expert Mr. Blanc, the Telephone Expert Committee's report will be submitted to the Public Works Department within two weeks. The committee invited formal groups of telephone users to submit suggestions, but none did so. Only a few individuals went to the committee's office briefly.</p>

<h3>Truth of the Bizarre Homicide Remains Unclear</h3>
<p>Luo Yusheng's Statements Half True and Half False, Investigation Difficult. Luo Himself Owns a Safe Deposit Box at the Shanghai Bank. The Red Spots on the Suit Pants, Analyzed, are Not Bloodstains. Police Request the Court to Extend the Investigation.</p>
<p>Luo Yusheng, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang, who formerly worked as a lawyer, was assassinated and killed on June 10 last year in the Binhefang lane on Guangdong Road. His son, Luo Yusheng, is eleven years old and works as a teaching assistant at the Mingchen Elementary School at No. 21 Xinqiao Road in Nanshi. He is heavily suspected in the case of the murder of Jin Dai, a woman from Jinhua, and her daughter, Luo Guo, at No. 45 in the intersection of North Henan Road and Aierjin Road at 8:30 am on September 23 of this year. The investigation has been conducted by Hua Detective Shang Wu, Detective Zhao Qingkui, etc. from the Huishi Police. Luo Yusheng has been escorted to the Special Court and interrogated. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was further interrogated by Judge Liu Yugui in Criminal Court No. 8. The victim's family hired attorney Cheng Shangfeng to appear in court and file a civil lawsuit. The defendant Luo Yusheng hired attorneys Xu Jie and San to appear in court for defense. The police, during the postponement of this case, also obtained a formal letter from the court and transferred a suitcase and a radio from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The box was deposited by the defendant Luo Yusheng at the home of Wang Mingrong at No. 14 Jiu'anli, Huangjiayu Road in Nanshi, and then transferred to the Public Security Bureau by Wang. The box contained valuables, including a silver handbag, two keys with the number 4261, a small diamond, a pair of jade-encrusted pearl earrings (50 pearls in total), a small pearl flower, a pair of pearl earrings, a bracelet, a necklace, a gold book ring, one hundred loose pearls, one red and one blue gem, a pearl ring, two jade rings, a 500-yuan deposit slip from the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, a 10,000-yuan passbook from Hengda Xiang, a 4,000-yuan passbook from Taihe Company, a passbook from the Tongyuan Bank (all under the name of Jin Xiaoji), a 2,400-yuan deposit ticket from the Shanghai Bank under the name of Luo Huangji, a savings account in the name of Luo Shenji at the Zhejiang Local Industrial Bank, and three seals of Jin Ling, Jin Zhao, and Jin Lingxian, etc., all of which were valuable. The police attorney Zhang Tianyin stated that during the postponement of the case, the police had thoroughly investigated various pieces of evidence. However, because the defendant's statements to the police were half true and half false, the investigation was quite difficult. The defendant had previously stated to the police that the suitcase and radio had been sent to Wang Mingrong's house, but he denied this during the court hearing. In addition to Wang Mingrong, who has already testified in court, there are also witnesses Cai Xingbao and Municipal Public Security Bureau patrol officer No. 8781 who can testify. When the incident occurred, the police detectives went to investigate. Jin Lingyi, the mother of the deceased Jin Dai (Baozhen), stated that two seals hidden in a teapot, a photo of Jin Lingyi herself, and a photo of Jin Youmai Bao Xing were stolen. Now, these items were found in the suitcase presented by Wang Mingrong. It was also found that the defendant had a safe deposit box at the Shanghai Bank with the number 1741, opened on September 2 of this year in the name of Jin Xinji. The police requested and were granted permission by the court to issue an official letter to the Shanghai Bank, and in the presence of a clerk, the box was opened. The box contained the defendant's father's seal and gold jewelry passbook, etc. Another safe deposit box belonging to the victim was stored, in the name of Dai Baozhen, with the number 426, which was also opened. It contained stock certificates of the Home Industry Cooperative and the Zhonghua Huashu Co., Ltd., etc. However, it was found that the box had been opened on the 1st of the previous month, which is consistent with the defendant's previous statement that the safe deposit box keys had been stolen ten days before the incident. There was also a trolley ticket found at the scene of the incident. The police investigated with the trolley company, and the result was that it was not a ticket from the 22nd, nor was it the defendant's. There was also a pair of suit pants found at the defendant's residence, with many red spots on the trouser legs. The police suspected that they were the deceased's bloodstains, so they were sent to the Public Works Department Health Office for analysis. The results of the analysis showed that there was no blood reaction, and it was not bloodstains. However, it could not be determined what the stains were. If the court believes that further analysis is necessary, the police will send it to an expert for analysis. The defendant previously stated to the police that the fugitive Xu Wenxian and a person surnamed Ma had committed the crime, but according to the police's speculation, Xu and Ma may not exist. The defendant must have colluded with another person to commit the crime himself. The deceased Jin Dai suffered a total of six knife wounds to the head, one knife wound to the right eye and neck, and three fingers on her right hand were cut off. The maid Luo Guo also suffered four knife wounds to the head and face. According to this situation, the perpetrators' methods were extremely fierce, and it seemed that they had planned to retaliate in advance. The defendant's statements that his father was killed and that the property was withheld by the Jin family, and that the defendant had repeatedly requested its return, etc., were consistent with the circumstances. After the postponement, on October 29, the defendant personally wrote a statement in the police station, admitting that he had gone with Xu Wenxian and a person surnamed Ma to kill Jin and others. Therefore, it is proposed that the court postpone the case again so that the police can conduct a detailed investigation during the postponement, in the hope of obtaining sufficient evidence. Therefore, Municipal Public Security Bureau police officer No. 8781 Yang Daocen testified that on September 23, I was stationed at the entrance of Jiu'anli, Huangjiaque Road. Between 12:00 noon and 2:00 pm, I saw the defendant riding a bicycle to No. 14 Yuan'anli, but I cannot remember whether he had any objects in his hand. Judge Liu questioned the defendant about this, and Luo replied that he was riding to play. Witness Wang Mingrong testified that I am the landlord of No. 14 Jiu'anli. The defendant came to rent the parlor room in May at a monthly rent of 12 yuan. He moved out on September 8. On September 23, at 10:30 am, the defendant came to rent the parlor room again, paid a rent of 10 yuan, and deposited a suitcase in the room. At 2:00 or 3:00 pm, the defendant also brought a radio. The next day, I saw news reports about Luo Yusheng's arrest and thought it was of great importance, so I reported it to the Public Security Bureau. When the defendant Luo Chusheng heard this, he admitted that he had gone to rent the house and deposit the radio, but denied that the suitcase was his. Judge Liu questioned him about the confession made at the police station and asked if it was written by him. The defendant replied that although it was written by him, it was under duress and not voluntary. He completely overturned his admission that he had colluded with others to kill Jin Dai, and only stated that although he suspected that Jin Dai was related to his father's murder last year, he had no substantial evidence, etc. Finally, witness Cai Xingfei testified that before the incident, the defendant had gone to the deceased's home to move a suitcase and radio, and that Cai had helped with the moving. Judge Liu verified the confessions. Since it was past noon and further analysis of the suit pants found at the defendant's residence was necessary, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The case was postponed for further hearing on the afternoon of October 9. The victim's lawyer stood up and stated that because the deceased's family could not afford the funeral expenses, he requested permission to have the Tongyuan Bank passbook released to Jin Lingyi for safekeeping. The court approved this. The court adjourned the session with the sounding of the clock.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department Requesting Correction of Unfair Penalties</h3>
<p>Due to the Health Office's One-Sided Acceptance of Garbage Headman's Report</p>
<p>The Public Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday: "Dear Sirs, According to a letter from Dai Guo'an of Yifeng Tobacco Shop, No. 4, Lane 1451, Xinzha Road, Yifeng Tobacco Shop has been established in the Concession for many years. Due to rent issues, it moved to Garage No. 4, Tongdeli, Lane 1451, Xinzha Road at the end of April of this year. The family lives separately at No. 16. Since the resumption of business, the search for rent has still been difficult, like a ram butting a fence, advancing and retreating being difficult. Unexpectedly, around the Dragon Boat Festival, a person speaking with a Jiangbei accent came to demand petty rules. The merchant was short on money and did not agree to his request. He left resentfully. After investigation, it was discovered that he was the garbage headman Gu Xiaoma of No. 33. His father is also engaged in this industry in the East District. The merchant did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, out of resentment, on August 20, Gu took advantage of his position to commit fraud, secretly inquired about the neighbor's servants, and openly copied the merchant's store number and house number, falsely reporting to the Public Works Department Health Office, falsely accusing the merchant's store of being unclean and violating regulations. Suddenly, on September 27, the merchant received a court summons. After reading it, the merchant was deeply surprised. Countless car-hiring shops are set up next to the Public Works Department's elementary school, and countless cars stop in front of the door. Students and maids enter and exit four times a day. In addition, there are various vendors, as dense as scales. The food and fruit peels are discarded all over the ground, and the broken paper scraps of the food purchased by the students returning home from the candy sales department set up in the school are also thrown on the store's must-pass road. The merchant pays extreme attention to cleanliness and sweeps all day long, never taking a break, as everyone knows and can be investigated. Furthermore, the wind blows leaves, which fall randomly. The garbage headman Gu Xiaoma, in order to fail to extort petty rules, harmed the merchant by relying on his power to make false accusations, and has no way to appeal. The authorities do not investigate and listen to one side of the story, suing in court for punishment, which is unbearable and unthinkable for people to live. Therefore, I sincerely ask your association to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants, transfer a letter to the Public Works Department to correct it, and provide relief to the merchants, which is both a public virtue and convenient, etc. Having arrived at the association, the Health Office should investigate the accusations in detail and carefully examine the environment in which the accused is located. If it is indeed the act of the accused, then the punishment is justified, and the wind of false accusations out of resentment will naturally disappear. According to the letter, it is appropriate to send a letter to your department to quickly correct the Health Office's indiscriminate accusations and penalties."</p>

<p>Significance of Promotion</p>
<p>In order to widely promote the significance of Animal Day, the association has specially arranged for Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Min Bao, three major newspapers in Shanghai, to publish special supplements today. Local movie theaters in Shanghai will add promotional lantern slides. Slogans will be posted on trams. At the same time, all radio stations in the city will be specially engaged to broadcast lectures on Animal Day as a public service. The text of the lecture is as follows: Today is October 4th, which is also the annual World Animal Day. Animals have the same right to survive as we humans. However, humans often rely on their superior intelligence and strength to slaughter and kill weak animals for food, creating a cruel stain on human peace and rationality. Therefore, many sages and wise men in our country advocated the idea of ​​benevolence and love for all things thousands of years ago to teach people to be good. Mencius also said, "When I see its life, I cannot bear to see its death." This sentence clearly teaches people not to kill and not to abuse all animals. Various European and American countries have had organizations to protect animals for hundreds of years, vigorously advocating animal protection, and the government has enacted special laws. However, our country did not have such an organization until last year when the Chinese Animal Protection Association was established to promote animal protection. Today, the association is holding its second Animal Protection Promotion Convention at the City Chamber of Commerce. It is hoped that the audience will keep in mind the concept of ​​the unity of all things and love animals at all times and in all places, and that they will never arbitrarily abuse or kill them. This is the only way to show the benevolent spirit of humanity and restore the new life of our country's inherent virtues. From today onwards, I urge you all not to forget the meaning of this Animal Day.</p>
<p>Entertainment Program</p>
<p>(1) Music performance by the orphanage military band; (2) Speech by Liu Chunshan; (3) National music by the Postal Workers' Union; (4) Cantonese opera by Ms. Huang Cuiyu, Zhou Jieming, Yang Guisheng; (5) Comedy by the alumni of Renhui Primary School; (6) National music by the Zhonghua Jiande Association; (7) Harmonica by the alumni of Renhui Primary School; (8) Qin opera by Pan Renwei; (9) Music by the Mingyue Opera Troupe; (10) Animal protection song; (11) Love for life song; (12) Opera by the Mingyue Opera Troupe; (13) Singing by Ms. Bai Hong, Li Mingjian; (14) Magic by Xu Shengxiang.</p>
<p>One Day of Slaughter Suspension</p>
<p>Previously, the chairman of the association, Ye Gongchuo, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Interior to issue an order to all provinces, cities, and counties across the country to suspend slaughter for one day on October 4th (today). In Shanghai, the Chinese area has been instructed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and Public Security Bureau to comply. In the Special District, the Public Works Department has also agreed to issue a written notice to persuade slaughterhouses to comply, in order to show animal protection and provide a visual lesson. The original letter from the Public Works Department's representative, He Deqiu, replying to the Animal Protection Association, is recorded as follows: In response to your letter, we have received your letter stating that October 4th is World Animal Day, and your association is proposing to promote the animal protection movement. We would like to request the Public Works Department to issue an order on this day to prohibit the slaughter of all kinds of animals within its jurisdiction, in order to show animal protection and provide a visual lesson. We are extremely willing to support this. However, the Acting Director-General of our Bureau believes that, bound by established regulations, the Public Works Department has no authority to prohibit slaughter. This is the difference between the Chinese area and the concession. However, after consulting with the Director of the Health Department, he has agreed to issue a written notice to the slaughterhouses in the concession to persuade them to refrain from slaughtering for one day, in order to show animal protection and provide a visual lesson. We are writing this special letter to reply, hoping that you will take note of it. Sincerely, He Deqiu. October 2nd.</p>
<h3>Yangjiadu Warehouse of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Suffers Huge Shortage of Goods</h3>
<p>Over 500 Pieces of Miscellaneous Grain Missing. Warehouse Manager Dismissed and Shortages Investigated. New Warehouse Manager Lin Zhongzhen Takes Over.</p>
<p>The Yangjiadu warehouse of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently suffered a large-scale theft of goods. After the company discovered this, the warehouse manager was dismissed and investigated, and a new warehouse manager was appointed to take over. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing Stacking of Intermodal Transport Goods</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Longhai Railway intermodal transport goods were initially unloaded at the Jinliyuan Wharf warehouse. Later, because the warehouses on the southern wharves were filled with goods arriving from regular liner services from the North and South Seas and imported goods from Yangtze River steamers, they were insufficient. Therefore, the intermodal transport goods loaded from Lianyungang were changed to be stacked in the Yangjiadu Wharf warehouse. Ships from Laoyao were also unloaded at this warehouse, so most of the goods stacked there were goods transported from the Northwest.</p>
<p>Goods Missing from the Warehouse</p>
<p>Among the goods stored in the warehouse, miscellaneous grains transported from the Longhai Railway accounted for the majority. Recently, it was discovered that the warehouse had a shortage of more than 500 pieces of miscellaneous grains and other goods. It is not yet clear whether these missing goods were stolen. The company heard about this and first investigated the warehouse affairs department, confirming the facts. A report was made to General Manager Liu Hongsheng, who decided to conduct a thorough investigation of the shortage of goods.</p>
<p>Dismissing Warehouse Manager Jin</p>
<p>Warehouse Manager Jin Zeru should bear full responsibility for this matter, and the tally clerks also have considerable responsibility. Therefore, Warehouse Manager Jin Zeru was dismissed and investigated. At the same time, all goods stored in the warehouse were cleared, and a thorough investigation was conducted into the missing goods. According to the warehouse manager's statement to the company, when customers came to the warehouse to pick up goods, there were some shortages when the bags were changed, and the amount was huge, resulting in accumulated shortages. It was not the result of internal staff fraud.</p>
<p>New Warehouse Manager Takes Office</p>
<p>The company has appointed Lin Zhongzhen as the new warehouse manager of Yangjiadu. Lin has taken office. The deputy warehouse manager is a Mr. Li. The chief of the general affairs department of the company, together with the main staff members of the intermodal transport section of the warehouse affairs department, went to the Yangjiadu warehouse yesterday to review the stored goods. At the same time, they decided to conduct a thorough investigation into the missing goods to find out the truth.</p>

<h3>Epiphyllum Opens in Zhongxi Girls' School Garden</h3>
<p>Thirty-Five Blooms Opened the Night Before Last. Returned to Normal After Three Hours.</p>
<p>Epiphyllum has been regarded as an auspicious flower throughout the ages. Very few flower gardens in Shanghai grow it. This flower usually blooms once every few decades, and it always blooms at night. It is even less often seen. Things are valued for their rarity and occasional discovery.</p>
<p>Mistaken for Auspicious Sign</p>
<p>Zhongxi Girls' School at 11 Yidingpan Road in Shanghai was previously gifted several Epiphyllum plants by Guangdong native Huang Guiting. The school's landscape director, Miss Julia M. Wasson (Chinese name Wang Ziying), carefully cultivated them. It has been seven years now, and although they have been in bud all day, they have never been seen to bloom. Unexpectedly, the flower buds suddenly swelled and were about to bloom at dusk the day before yesterday (the 2nd). The landscape director realized that they were about to bloom, so she reported to the school principal, Yang Xizhen. The entire school was immediately stirred, and students separately notified friends by telephone. They gathered by the flowers and waited until 8:30 PM, when the petals gradually unfolded and opened. By 9:30 PM, they were in full bloom, with a total of thirty-five blooms. The yellow stamens and the original red stems and green leaves of the flowers created an infinitely delicate scene. After 10 PM, they gradually began to contract until 11:15 PM, when the flower buds closed and returned to their original state. When the flowers were in full bloom, the school specially invited artistic photographer Fu Yingguang to take several photos.</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Refuses to Pay Fare, Assaults Rickshaw Puller, Arrested</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, at 2:25 AM on the 3rd, at the corner of Laobazi Road and Zhapu Road, two Japanese residents, heavily intoxicated, had a dispute with a rickshaw puller over the fare. Several private security guards nearby came forward to mediate. The two Japanese men, seeing the situation was not good for them, fought with the rickshaw puller. One rickshaw puller was injured and fell to the ground. When the Public Works Department police arrived, they wanted to take everyone involved to the Hongkou Police Station. One of the Japanese men who committed the assault desperately fled. Several Chinese police officers chased after him, but he managed to escape. Later, the fleeing assailant surrendered himself to the Hongkou Police Station. The two Japanese offenders were handed over to the Japanese Consulate General Police Department. It is reported that the chief of the department, Wakui, was on duty, and the rickshaw puller who was beaten down by the Japanese man suffered a severe laceration, but his life is not in danger.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Library Book Category Ratios</h3>
<p>Adding a Book Counter</p>
<p>The books in the Public Works Department Library are generally divided into two types: fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is the most popular among general readers, so the library purchases more fiction books. Recently, the library director drafted a list of books to be added and asked the Public Works Department Library Committee to review it. During the review, the committee mentioned the issue of the relative proportions of fiction and non-fiction books. In January 1932, the Library Committee stated that the proportion of non-fiction books exceeded the appropriate level and stipulated that when the library purchases new books, the ratio of fiction to non-fiction should generally be three to one. Therefore, the list of books to be added by the library this time also showed that the proportion of non-fiction books was too high. The Library Committee deleted eleven types of non-fiction books. In the future, the purchase of books will continue to be handled in accordance with the original ratio. In addition, the Public Works Department Library has cumbersome book borrowing procedures and is prone to errors in recording. In order to reduce the procedure and prevent the loss of books, it is planned to add a Dickman book counter, priced at more than 140 US dollars. The American manufacturer has agreed to ship the machine to Shanghai for a three-month trial. This machine was invented by the American Efficiency Promotion Bureau. Major libraries in Washington, New York, Philadelphia, and other cities have adopted it and achieved excellent results. In the future, when the Public Works Department Library is satisfied with the trial use, it will also purchase one, which will greatly benefit both the library and the readers.</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Car Accident Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Fine of 300 Yuan, Compensation of 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai, a 35-year-old tennis player from Xiamen, residing at No. 5, Lane 217, Talas Road in the French Concession, was driving his private car No. 6474 on Foch Road from west to east at 6 AM on July 30th. Due to the driver's negligence, he hit Cui Zhen, the ten-year-old daughter of Huang Hanchen, a Jiangxi native residing at No. 29, Cihou Lane, Hartung Road, causing fatal injuries. Later, the father of the deceased, Huang Hanchen, hired lawyer Fan Gang to represent him in filing a private prosecution in the Second Special District Court, accusing Qiu Feihai of causing death due to negligence and requesting compensation for losses of 11,400 yuan in an accompanying civil lawsuit. The defendant, Qiu Feihai, also hired a lawyer to defend him. The debate concluded and a date was set for the verdict, as previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, when the time for the verdict arrived, both the plaintiff and defendant reported on time. Judge Xiong Huiping ascended the seat in the Second Court and ordered the two parties to be brought to the court to announce the verdict. The main text of the verdict was: Qiu Feihai is fined 300 yuan for causing death due to negligence. In the civil lawsuit, he shall compensate the plaintiff for losses of 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Large Number of Gamblers Arrested on Laobazi Road, Totaling Eighty-Seven People</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Police Station's detective learned that a large gambling den was located at No. 47, Laobazi Road, north of Zhapu Road, on the corner, in a three-story Western-style building with a double entrance (the Taifeng Real Estate Company on the ground floor and the gambling den on the third floor). The gambling den had games such as shaking cups and twelve-door car and horse cannons, and gambling continued day and night, with huge wins and losses. The gamblers were all Chinese and foreign respectable merchants. Yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon at 4 PM, a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched in six patrol cars to rush to the third floor. At that time, the gambling bosses were in high spirits. They were immediately arrested, and the gambling bosses Tian Decheng (also known as Lingjiang Ade and Yu Guibao, nicknamed Wild Chicken Tuanzi Guibao), Xiao Xu (also known as Xiaobaidang Xiao Xu), and Chao Bang gamblers Zheng Jiazhi, gamblers Jin Xiaohong, Wang Yunchang, Wan Genbao, and others, totaling eighty-seven people, as well as chips, banknotes, gambling equipment, etc., were all taken to the police station for investigation. It was found that the gambling den had only been established for four days. The interior was beautifully decorated, and the equipment was complete. There were fifteen tea room attendants and servants. Gamblers were picked up and dropped off by cars, and the wins and losses amounted to tens of thousands of yuan every night. It is said that it was protected by a certain foreigner, and it is widely rumored that it was registered with the competent consulate.</p>
<h3>He Jieyuan's Daughter Disappears, Accuses Liao Yiwen of Enticement</h3>
<p>Dismissed Due to Lack of Jurisdiction, Transferred to the District Court for Trial</p>
<p>Liao Yiwen, 24 years old, from Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, has lived in Shanghai for many years. At first, he had no proper occupation, so his residence was uncertain. In September of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), Liao rented a room in the home of He Jieyuan, a Shaoxing native, at No. 29, Zonggongyi Car, Kulun Road, Zhabei, and became very close to He's children. He's daughter, who was only a teenager at the time and studying at a certain school, often secretly communicated with Liao behind her parents' backs. The following autumn, after Liao moved away, their correspondence became even more frequent. Liao also visited the school from time to time under various pretexts. He was unaware of this secret communication. Although He's younger brother had heard a little about it, he never told his sister-in-law about it. On the morning of August 24th of this year, He's daughter took advantage of her father's absence to write a letter to Liao at her desk. Unexpectedly, her mother saw it, and she was severely reprimanded. As a result, out of shame and anger, the daughter quietly left home and disappeared. On the same day, He's younger brother received a letter delivered by mail, signed by the daughter, but upon careful examination of the handwriting, it did not resemble her writing. The letter said that she could not bear the family's bullying and had fled to her ancestral home in Ningbo and Shaoxing. He immediately inquired in his hometown, but there was no trace of his daughter. Later, he learned about Liao's relationship with his daughter over the years and, based on the letters they had exchanged, concluded that his daughter's departure from home must have been due to Liao's enticement. However, He believed that since his daughter had already been betrothed to someone, it would be difficult to let her fly away. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Liao for enticement, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Article 241, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The court had opened hearings twice, but the defendant could not be served, so the case could not be investigated. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang continued the summons. The defendant and his defense lawyer surrendered to the court and stated that he was currently employed at the Dongfang Pharmacy at No. 620, Sichuan Road, and resided at a friend's place, but denied enticing the plaintiff's daughter. The court then asked He about the circumstances surrounding his daughter's disappearance. Because the incident occurred in the Chinese area, the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the case and should transfer it to the Shanghai District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Elder Brother Accuses Younger Brother of Neglecting Support</h3>
<p>Zhao Yousan Sues Zhao Peiwen, Must Investigate the Case Further Before Trial</p>
<p>Zhao Peiwen, a Tianjin native and owner of Zhenhua Cloth Store at No. 2, Shanxi Road (Pintang Lane), is the son of Zhao Lianyuan. Lianyuan is now 74 years old and lives in his hometown in Tianjin. He has five sons in total, and Peiwen is the fourth. He is now 41 years old. The eldest son, Zhao Yousan, is in his fifties and resides at No. 186, Ruihua Fang, Laozhenfu Road, French Concession. He and his younger brother Peiwen have never been on good terms. Recently, all the family's businesses have been controlled by Peiwen, causing the elder brother to live in poverty and have difficulty making a living. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution against Peiwen for abandonment. An elder brother accusing a younger brother of neglecting support has rarely occurred before. This type of lawsuit is probably a new development in the judicial organs of the Special District. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang of the First Special District Court opened the Fifth Court to summon both the plaintiff and defendant for questioning. According to the plaintiff, Zhao Yuer, the family property is worth about 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, all of which are controlled by the defendant. Zhenhua Cloth Store was founded in the 14th year of the Republic (1925) with a capital of 11,000 yuan, and is managed by the defendant. He used to give me 40 yuan per month, but suddenly stopped paying after March of the previous year. I have repeatedly negotiated with him, but he has refused, so I have filed a lawsuit. In response, the defendant, Zhao Peiwen, stated that his ancestors did not leave any property. Both Zhenhua and Huamao Cloth Stores were founded by me. The plaintiff has always been of bad character. He once wrote a letter of repentance. Because he never repented, I broke off relations with him, etc. The court held that the case still needed to be investigated, so it was decided to postpone the hearing and summon witnesses again for verification.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Shooting of Passersby on X'ian Road</h3>
<p>Three robbers suddenly went to a certain family at No. 16, Lane 31, Xi'an Road, at about 7:30 last night to commit a robbery. Only one of the robbers was carrying a gun. At that time, the people in the house were having dinner, so they were monitored and forced to hand over the safe keys. They searched separately. After about half an hour, they robbed more than 300 yuan. The robbers then withdrew and fled outside the lane. At that time, the owner of the house also chased out of the lane and shouted for catching robbers. The police officers nearby gathered after hearing the alarm. The three robbers, feeling desperate, turned around and fired two shots, hitting two passersby on the side of the road, who immediately fell to the ground. The robbers took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The two injured passersby were reported to the police station by the police officers and were sent to the hospital for treatment by car. The police are searching for the escaped criminals.</p>
<h3>China Agricultural and Industrial Bank Issues New One-Yuan Banknote, Totaling One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The China Agricultural and Industrial Bank has issued one-yuan banknotes that have been circulating in the market for a long time. Most of them are old and worn. Now, it has been specially approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue new one-yuan exchange notes with the Shanghai place name for the purpose of exchanging old banknotes. The total amount of the new one-yuan exchange notes is one million yuan. About 100,000 yuan has been issued, and the rest will continue to be issued.

Both the front and back are light red. The front is a picture of cultivation, and the back is a picture of weaving. It will be issued starting today and will be fully redeemed at par with the exchange notes printed by the American Banknote Company that are currently in circulation. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Restructuring of the Sheen-Ts' News Agency, Mi Xingru Resigns, Tang Shichang Succeeds</h3>
<p>Mi Xingru, the president of Sheen-Ts' News Agency, has been in charge of the agency for nearly four years. He has spared no effort in promoting the development of the industry. In addition to expanding telecommunications and increasing postal communications, he also published Chinese and English economic intelligence reports, which were subscribed to by many domestic financial and industrial circles and embassies and consulates in China, becoming a sensation for a time. Recently, Mr. Mi has resigned from the board of directors due to his busy personal affairs and lack of time to attend to the agency. After being persuaded to stay without success, Mr. Tang Shichang has succeeded him. The future should have new developments.</p>
<h3>County Government Reissues Third-Term Opium Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's tobacco prohibition plan is based on the provincial government's regulations, which stipulate four years, shortened by one year, and is expected to be completely banned in three years. The county has already transferred young people to the county's opium rehabilitation center for treatment in order. The county government has found that the second-term opium addicts' licenses will expire at the end of September. However, the third-term licenses cannot be received and reissued as scheduled. Therefore, starting this month, the procedures for renewing the licenses will be carried out, that is, the words "Temporarily Replace Third-Term License" will be stamped on the second-term licenses.</p>
<h3>Abduction and Prostitution of a Female Student Punished</h3>
<p>Chen Xinyi, a 43-year-old man from Nanjing and a Catholic, had a daughter named Chen Zhiying, who was 19 years old this year. After graduating from a rural elementary school, she came to Shanghai two years ago and was admitted to the Xuhui Girls' Middle School, a Catholic school in Xujiahui, Shanghai, where she studied. On July 2nd of this year, the school began its summer vacation. The following morning at 9:00 AM, Zhiying accompanied a classmate home. They took a car to the North Station, where they met Cui Wang, a fellow Catholic and cousin of Zhiying's classmate, Jiao Yunying. (Cui Wang often visited the school to see Jiao, so she knew Zhiying.) Zhiying was forcibly taken to Cui's home at 32 Keller Road in the French Concession. First, Cui Wang's husband, Cui Kedong, seduced and defiled her. Then, under the pretext of recommending her for a nursing position, he made her write a voluntary statement and colluded with accomplices to force her into a brothel opened by a woman named Wang Zhang in Hengmao Lane No. 48, Baixianqiao, turning her into a prostitute. Zhiying languished in this hell for over a month before managing to send a letter to her parents. Her father, Chen Jiayi, came to Shanghai and reported the matter to the French police, who arrested Cui and his wife, as well as the madam Wang Zhang and a pimp named Xue Fengming. They were all handed over to the Second Special Court. The Police Department charged them under Articles 241 (Sections 1 and 2), 243, and 296 of the Criminal Law, for offenses against the family and offenses against freedom. After repeated interrogations and court debates, the trial concluded. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Cui Kedong to eight years of imprisonment for abducting a woman under the age of twenty from her guardian for profit, and deprived him of his civil rights for eight years. Cui Wang and Wang Zhang were each sentenced to four years of imprisonment, and Xue Fengming was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Menghe Fei's Hospital: Medicine Donations and Medical Achievements</h3>
<p>Menghe Fei's Hospital, located opposite the General Chamber of Commerce in Xiejiao, Shanghai, has repeatedly cured serious illnesses, earning a reputation at home and abroad. Recently, Lu Bingyuan, from the Central Mint Factory at No. 41 Ping'an Lane, Xiafei Road, suffered from lung disease. After being examined with X-rays at Tongde Hospital, it was found that both lungs were damaged, especially the right lung, and the pleura was also affected. He was also treated by German doctor Luxembourg, but his condition remained difficult to cure due to the long-term illness. On the recommendation of a famous doctor, he sought treatment at Menghe Fei's Hospital. Doctor Fei Zibin prescribed pills, and within a month, his health returned to normal. Furthermore, Xu Guangmao, a student at Huangdu Normal School, suffered from consumptive cough, and Chen Shunxiang, from No. 31 Yonghe Lane, Yangshupu Road, suffered from chronic dysentery and bloody stools. Both were cured by Doctor Fei in a short period of time. Furthermore, Doctor Fei, recognizing the prevalence of malignant malaria in Minhang Town in the suburbs of Shanghai, specially prepared 500 packets of the hospital's special malaria and dysentery medicine, "Malarial Relief," and sent a special person to the town to distribute it to save patients without taking any money.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, I recently read in your newspaper about the Jardine Matheson comprador being threatened by bandits for extortion. However, the article stated that "it was found that Xi Bingxian, who used to be an accountant in the iron industry, resigned for some reason and has been borrowing money from the employer from time to time. Recently, last month, he went to ask for a loan but was refused and left in resentment. Perhaps this person is responsible for this incident." I was shocked to read this. Xi Bingxian has never worked as an accountant for our iron industry, nor did he ask me for a loan last month. He is an upright person and currently has a proper occupation at the Zhen Ting Sericulture School. He would never be involved in extortion. Fearing that this would damage Xi Bingxian's reputation, I dare to send this letter to inform you. I beg that your newspaper make a statement clarifying this matter tomorrow. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Dai Ziqing of Tianhe Foreign Firm, October 3rd.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Kangjianzhaifu)</p>
<p>Today is World Animal Day. The whole world, as usual, refrains from slaughtering for one day. At this time of extreme peril in the international situation, when the ambitious imperialists are preparing for the second great human slaughter of the twentieth century, those benevolent and righteous people are promoting kindness to animals. It is somewhat akin to the faint starlight visible in a remote corner of the sky amid the dark clouds.</p>
<p>"The benevolent love their relatives and then love the people, and love the people and then cherish things." This is the beginning of the great path of universal love. But in this era, there is no talk of loving the people, let alone cherishing things.</p>
<p>If humanity would only take a step back and reflect, using the Buddhist theory of cause and effect and reincarnation to console ourselves, perhaps humanity's self-slaughter is the karmic result of our past cruelty to other beings. From a materialistic historical perspective, the motive for humanity's self-slaughter still lies in the pursuit of survival. The desire to survive is the inherent nature of all things. How can we cherish the lives of other beings, delay the death penalty for all creatures by even one day, and reduce the millions upon millions of gallons of bloodshed? Perhaps this could alleviate even one ten-thousandth of humanity's own sins. This is more effective than the Kalachakra Tantra Dharma Assembly and the Pope's prayers for peace.</p>
<p>Absolute non-harm to animals, everyone knows, is an impossible thing. We take this Animal Day to propose a few universal principles for the protection of animals:</p>
<p>1.  Animals that benefit humanity should not be harmed unless necessary.</p>
<p>2.  Animals that have no benefit or harm to humanity should be allowed to coexist and thrive.</p>
<p>3.  Animals that are harmful to humanity should be eliminated to reduce human suffering.</p>
<p>4.  Before slaughtering animals, efforts should be made to shorten or reduce their suffering.</p>
<p>5.  Animals kept as pets should have their suffering in captivity reduced as much as possible, restoring their freedom and naturalness.</p>
<h3>Animal Day</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>"Even ants and insects cherish their lives!" We can know that all living things in the world love life and hate death. However, cruel humans, using their agile minds, exploit them to serve humanity, and even slaughter parts of them (such as cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc.) to be used as food or delicacies for people to feast on! However, we must also distinguish between animals that can be used to serve humans or are beneficial to humanity. It is absolutely inappropriate to use them as food and they must be carefully protected. If they are animals that are not beneficial to humans, it is not impossible to use them as meat on the table. Furthermore, beasts such as jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards are not only useless to people, but also endanger human life, so they must be eliminated.</p>
<p>Today is World Animal Day. The Shanghai China Animal Protection Association will hold its second propaganda conference this afternoon at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and will also hold a general membership meeting. Major newspapers will publish special Animal Day supplements, and movie theaters will add promotional films. Furthermore, it has been requested that the Executive Yuan's Ministry of the Interior issue a circular to all provinces, cities, and counties in the country, requiring them to stop slaughtering animals for one day on this day. All of these measures can be said to have exhausted the meaning of protecting animals. However, animals are, after all, animals. The flood victims in the disaster areas, who are one level above animals, are crying out for food. It is hoped that the gentlemen of the Animal Protection Association will transfer their benevolence in caring for animals to find ways to relieve the disaster victims, which would be an immeasurable virtue!</p>
<h3>Continuing "Shanghai's Pull"</h3>
<p>— Zuichi Sheng</p>
<p>Reading the previous article "Shanghai's Pull" in this journal, I felt that there were several kinds of "pulling" facts that had not yet been mentioned. Now, I might as well talk about them to join in the fun.</p>
<p>In the evening, if you walk through a certain section of Avenue Edward VII, you will see small hotels lined up on that side. Some, resembling tea houses, stand or sit at the door. Even if you don't look at them, they will enthusiastically greet you. "Hey, sir, do you want a room? Or a girl, a real virgin, guaranteed to be good. Do you want to open a room and have some fun?" Even if you shake your head to indicate no, they will keep nagging you. This kind of "pull" has two meanings. It is somewhat different from a prostitute soliciting customers.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was strolling on the road at night. Someone would softly say to you: "Do you want to go to the club? Inside there is pai gow, there is shaking stalls, there is.... Guaranteed you won't get into trouble." However, in recent years, the foreign concessions have been very strict with gambling prohibitions. This kind of "pull" is no longer common.</p>
<p>One day, I was walking through Nanshi. There were quite a few opium dens open there. Seeing these mysterious shops, I couldn't help but pay attention to them. Suddenly, someone wearing short clothes ran over and said, "Sir, do you want to smoke opium? We have aged paste, new beds, and women to prepare the pipe for you." This happened twice in a row. Unfortunately, I am not a leisurely person and don't have the qualifications to inhale smoke. Otherwise, hearing these tempting words, I would really salivate three feet!</p>
<p>In the area around Dongmen Road, Shiliupu, Nanshi, if you take a rickshaw with bedding and luggage, someone will follow you or grab the rickshaw pole and greet you: "Are you going on the ×× Lun ship? Do you want ship tickets?" This kind of "pull" can also be seen often.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the Lun ships at various places dock at the wharf, the passengers disembark one after another: many rickshaw pullers will swarm forward to solicit business. If you have luggage, it will be very troublesome. Letting them snatch and grab from each other will either result in material losses or they will try to rip you off. There are also dock thugs who take the opportunity to rob people. This kind of "pull" is very harmful to travelers and should be strictly prohibited!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: The Chief Clerk Cherishes His Reputation, Knowing How to Knock on Doors; New Love Leaves Flesh and Blood, No Way to Visit the Sick</p>
<p>Shi Lian waved his hand and said, "You don't need to say it, I know everything. Now I'm asking you, what kind of illness are you suffering from? Why are you sitting at the gate?" The old woman shook her head and said, "I don't know what kind of illness it is either. But I feel very flustered. I can't lie in bed, I want to sit here and look at my granddaughter." Shi Lian smiled and said, "Isn't that a joke? Her place is several courtyards away from this back door, how can you see her?" In the old woman's lackluster eyes, tears actually flowed. She said in a trembling voice, "Yes, I can't see her, but I feel better sitting here." As she spoke, she dragged the sleeve of her right hand with her left hand, and kept rubbing her eyes. Shi Lian felt sad when he saw her like this. He stood there blankly for a while, and then looked at the gate of her house. He asked, "This is very strange. You are a sick old woman sitting outside the gate, why don't your family members come out to see you?" The old woman said, "My daughter-in-law is also sitting here, accompanying me. I'm hoping for my granddaughter, doesn't she hope for her daughter?" She went to boil water for me to drink. My relative, Sister Hu, is probably angry and doesn't comfort us anymore." As she said this, she seemed to be struggling to speak, so she leaned her head against the wall and closed her eyes slightly. Shi Lian said, "Old woman, how long have you been waiting here?" She opened her eyes and raised her two crooked fingers upwards. Shi Lian said, "Oh! You've been sitting here for two days." The old woman nodded twice. Shi Lian said, "Old woman, your granddaughter is fine, she wanted to come to see you, but..." The old woman quickly interrupted, "What? Did Master Jia let her out?" As she said this, she supported the wall and suddenly stood up. However, she was ultimately standing up too quickly. With this sudden rush upwards, she was excited, but then she fell downwards, almost falling to the ground. How could an old woman who was not far from death withstand such a fall? When Shi Ying saw this, he felt sweat pouring down his body. (332)</p>
<h3>Records of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(Unnumbered Chapter) Meeting of the Author and Translator</p>
<p>One morning, the newspapers all published the news of her departure from Shanghai to the north. I knew that if I wanted to see her, I couldn't delay any longer. However, I also knew that my temper was too bad, and I couldn't stand the sight of those foreign servants in洋行 (foreign companies) and the so-called "俊歐 (handsome Europeans)." Therefore, I deliberately waited until about 3:20 in the afternoon before going to the North Railway Station with a belly full of curiosity, to pay a very hurried and impolite visit.</p>
<p>Walking into the platform and along the row of blue carriages that stood out like a crane among chickens, I found a chubby, middle-aged woman's face in the first window. Her makeup was very heavy, and a black Western hat was pressed low on her forehead. Below were two very fluent but not very large black eyes and a flat nose. With just this one glance, I knew that the person I wanted to see was in front of me.</p>
<p>It was a first-class sleeper compartment on the Shanghai-Ping train. The furnishings were, of course, extremely luxurious. Our old princess was wearing a fashionable blue Western suit, and a string of bright cherry-like red glass beads hung around her neck (or perhaps they were treasures, who knows?). She was sitting inside, very appropriately. I knocked a few times on the open door – even I couldn't avoid acting Western, given her Western air. As usual, she said "Come in" and stood up to greet me at the doorway.</p>
<p>I am a tall person, and she only reached my chest when she stood up, so I still felt she was a bit too fat and too short, not as tall as a "real foreigner," but compared to the women of our country, she could probably be ranked in the first class.</p>
<p>She must have been influenced by the Old Buddha (Empress Dowager Cixi). Although she had lost her youth, she still loved to dress up. The scent of perfume kept wafting into my nostrils. When I shook her hand, I saw that her fingernails were also dyed with very red nail polish. To be honest, she really looked very young, only like someone in their mid-thirties, and couldn't be called an old lady!</p>
<p>After exchanging names and briefly introducing myself, I asked her if she could spare some time when she returned to Shanghai from Beijing to discuss a few questionable points about "Records of the Imperial Incense." She immediately declared very sincerely that the book was written too hastily, and errors were inevitable, so she very much approved of my being able to discuss it with her in detail when she returned south. She also hoped to have the entire translation that I had done sent to her to look at. This made me a little apprehensive. To be honest, my translation was really not something to be shown in public, but since she had this hope, I would have to bite the bullet and send it to her anyway. (Two)</p>
<h3>People Waiting for War</h3>
<p>Biographies</p>
<h3>Painter Gao Jianfu</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>In the Chinese Western painting world, the leading figures in recent years have been the two gentlemen, Liu and Xu. However, at present, Mr. Gao Jianfu, who had long stood out but has been concealing himself, has risen to form a three-legged balance of power.</p>
<p>If we observe from the art itself, Gao has his own unique value, worthy of admiration. His paintings, which combine Chinese and Western methods, first had the foundation of the spiritual portrayal of traditional Chinese painting, and then added the realism of Western painting, discarding the dross of both sides and preserving their essence, and integrating them with his genius, so he can stand out as a unique and aesthetic school. One of his paintings, for people who have both Chinese and Western painting literacy to appreciate, will never make one side feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I originally had no personal connection with Gao, but I remember that my one-sided spiritual acquaintance with him began as early as the third or fourth year of the Republic of China. At that time, he was starting a store specializing in beauty and health products, located diagonally opposite the Commercial Press on Qipan Street, called the "Aesthetic Bookstore." The store sold printed framed pictures, art postcards, painting collections, and plaster statues, etc. Sometimes there were also Gao's and other famous artists' genuine works exhibited for sale. At that time, I was only twelve or thirteen years old. I didn't study painting myself, but I loved to read books, especially Gao's paintings, for which I had a special fondness. I occasionally saw the scrolls, etc., made by him in the old Chinese method of mounting, and I admired his unique, rich aura and harmonious colors. I would always linger and look at them for a while, with a reluctance to leave and a sense of satisfaction! Therefore, I gradually became associated with the Aesthetic Bookstore—probably a natural psychological manifestation of "love me, love my dog (愛屋及烏) —even to the point of —love my dog's house (愛烏及屋)." But unfortunately, I was young and had no money to buy paintings. I had no choice but to seek the next best thing, and every time I passed the Aesthetic Bookstore, I would often buy several kinds of art postcards, mostly collotype reduced prints of Gao's paintings. After that, a large portion of the pocket money I got in childhood was spent on this. After three or four years, my interest gradually faded due to diversification, and after some time, I passed Qipan Street again, and I didn't see the Aesthetic Bookstore. I don't know when the store moved or closed down.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the West Lake Exposition was held. I rushed to visit the exposition near its closing, and I had my first meeting with West Lake. I unexpectedly saw this long-lost painting by Gao in the art gallery, which was full of countless fine works by ancient and modern people. Although there were only two or five works, it was enough to create the pleasant association of "old friends and new acquaintances meeting at the same time!"</p>
<p>Now, this painter Gao has been fortunate enough to be recognized in his lifetime and has received a well-deserved reputation. I also feel sympathetic satisfaction! The situation is not entirely appropriate: poverty, prosperity, obscurity, and fame all change with the times, and praise, criticism, suppression, and promotion are inevitably flawed. Gao's current environment can be considered a blessing of luck. How many people in the world are truly given their due and receive fair recognition? However, I disagree with someone adding the honorable title of "revolutionary painter" to Gao, whether because he himself had worked hard for the National Revolution, or because his works contain revolutionary qualities. In terms of his career, revolution is revolution, and painter is painter, which are originally two different jobs and cannot be confused. In terms of his works, labeling them as revolutionary is not enough to summarize and fully express his strengths. This kind of undeserved praise is probably not helpful to the recipient, and for the speaker, it is loving in the wrong way!</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: Respected Editor, I have been suffering from lung disease for a long time. Treatment in Beijing was ineffective. In early spring, I wrote to you asking you to publish a notice seeking effective remedies, and also to inquire about the effectiveness of Yijincao (益金草). I was grateful that you responded in the Chunqiu column, saying that soliciting prescriptions had many drawbacks, but that Mrs. Huang, a colleague of yours, had taken Yijincao and found it very effective, and advised me to try it. I immediately followed your advice and purchased it from Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company in Rendeli, Zhaozhou Road, Shanghai. In less than a month, the disease was cured. It has been more than half a year since then, and there has been no recurrence, so I am certain that it has been completely cured. With gratitude, I am writing to thank you and request that you publish the original letter in Chunqiu so that those suffering from the same disease can find a beacon. I hope you will not refuse. Sincerely, Liang Boxin</p>

<p>Special Train Service on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, as the Sixth National Games will be held in the Shanghai Central District Sports Center, with the games scheduled for eleven days, from October 10th to 20th, have decided to operate special passenger trains to facilitate the round trips of spectators from all stations on the two lines. On the Beijing-Shanghai Line, a special passenger train will be operated from Beijing to Shanghai on October 9th, and a special passenger train will be operated from Shanghai to Beijing on October 21st. Tickets will only be sold to and from the stations of Shangbei (上北, likely referring to a station near Shanghai North), Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, a special passenger train will be operated from Zhabei to Shanghai on October 9th, and a special passenger train will be operated from Shanghai to Zhabei on October 21st. Tickets will only be sold to and from the stations of Shangbei (上北), Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Changan, Hangzhou, and Zhakou. Each of these trains will have approximately nine first, second, and third class carriages. Passengers who are not traveling to Shanghai to visit the National Games may also ride. However, the number of tickets sold will be limited to the number of seats on the train. Special round-trip tickets to Shangbei (上北) will be sold at the designated ticket stations, with first and second class tickets discounted by 25% from the ordinary fare, and third class tickets discounted by 15% from the ordinary fare. The validity period will be fourteen days and tickets may be sold from October 8th. Single tickets of each class should be charged according to the express train fare, and round-trip tickets of each class to stations other than Shangbei (上北) should also be charged according to the express train regulations and fees, with the validity period limited to seven days.</p>
<p>Traffic Control Measures</p>
<p>During the Games, there will definitely be a large number of visitors. In order to avoid traffic congestion, the Public Works Bureau has widened the roads such as Xiangyin Road, and the Public Utilities Bureau has designated the following four roads as one-way streets: West Sports Association Road, Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, and East Sports Association Road. The routes for all types of vehicles, such as private cars, commercial passenger cars, public buses, and freight trucks, have also been decided by the Public Utilities Bureau in consultation with the relevant bureaus. The parking locations for private cars have been designated in the north of the stadium, with a total of seventeen locations, each with a parking sign and number. When each car arrives at the stadium, a piece of paper will be issued by the organizing committee, with the designated parking space printed on it. Each private car should park in the designated space in order. All traffic routes and parking locations have been drawn into a map. Citizens who wish to obtain this map can go to the Vehicle Management Office of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, or the China Travel Service at 420 Sichuan Road, or the News Inspection Office at 306 Continental Department Store, etc., to obtain it.</p>
<p>Additional Public Buses</p>
<p>During the Games, in order to facilitate spectators, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Bus Management Office, the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company, the Shanghai-Minhang and Shanghai-Bao and Xihu Long-Distance Bus Companies have mobilized many vehicles to run special buses to facilitate transportation. The starting and ending points and fares of these public buses are listed below:</p>
<p>According to the starting points of the above routes, Huangxing Road is the furthest from the center of the concession. Spectators who want to avoid congestion can board the bus there. Although the converted freight vehicles on Zhengda Road are simpler, there are many vehicles there that depart at any time, which may reduce congestion.</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that there should be connections between the Chinese and Concession boundaries to facilitate passengers. It has ordered the Chinese Public Bus Company to contact the British Public Bus Company to extend the first route of the Chinese company to the back gate of Hongkou Park on Jiangwan Road (i.e., Tongli Road) as the terminal, in order to connect with the public buses in the Special Zone.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Football Team　Yesterday Lost to Guanghua</h3>
<p>Guanghua Has Xu Luo and Other Generals Serving, Greatly Increasing Their Reputation　The Sichuan Team Lacked Coordination, Resulting in a Miserable Defeat of Two to Six　—Today the Sichuan Team Plays the South China Team—</p>
<p>The Sichuan Province All-China Games football team had a practice match with the Guanghua football team at 3:30 PM yesterday at the Guanghua field. The Sichuan team arrived at the school at 3:00 PM. The Guanghua Sichuan Alumni Association specially posted slogans, warmly welcoming them. The team was organized by the 4th Division football team of the 21st Army of Sichuan. The players' uniforms consisted of blue wool coats and gray wool trousers, with a team emblem on the left lapel, which was quite dignified and beautiful. Yesterday, in their first test, they lost to Guanghua by two to six. However, the spirit of the team's players was admirable. Unfortunately, they had courage but lacked strategy. The coordination of the forwards was poor, and they missed many opportunities. If they could pay attention to this, they would be quite promising. I hope all the athletes will strive to compete for a place in the All-China Games. The details of yesterday's match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Half　Guanghua Feels the Momentum</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, referee Jiang Jingnan blew his whistle, and both sides deployed their formations and started the battle. Guanghua's forward Xu Jingcheng is a brave general from Donghua, and Luo Douwen and Jiang Zhaoxiang are also leaders among the youth team. The three forwards coordinated well. In less than ten minutes, Xu Jingcheng got the ball in the center and passed it to Douwen. Little Luo flew up with a kick, and the ball went right into the corner of the net, opening the scoring. The Sichuan team tried hard to counterattack. Zeng Zhengqi led the crowd, opening the way forward. Guanghua's defense was weak, and they were penetrated deep into their territory. Unfortunately, Zeng Zhengqi's shot was inaccurate and did not hit the target. After a period of melee, Xu Jingcheng showed his great power. Luo and Jiang worked hard to respond. The ball often hovered in front of the Sichuan team's goal. Within twenty minutes, Little Xu scored four consecutive goals. Guanghua took the lead with five to zero. Although the Sichuan team tried hard to recover the lost ground, the coordination of the forwards was not good enough, and they missed many good opportunities. The first half ended with this.</p>
<p>Second Half　Sichuan Team Slightly Wins</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, due to the disparity in strength between the two sides, Guanghua's Luo Douwen retired, and Xu Jingcheng was transferred to defense, which slightly evened the odds. The Sichuan team players still worked hard to fight, not discouraged by the defeat. Their spirit was commendable. The five forwards ran quite fast, but the passing was too slow, so they could not get what they wanted. After a period of melee, Zhong Shijin shot a high ball from the center line. The landing point was ten yards from the goal. Guanghua's defender Zhao Aisheng hooked it with his left foot, and the ball went straight into his own goal. Ling Xuan could not react in time and lost a goal. Not long after, Zeng Zhengqi attacked again, breaking through three barriers, and lightly passed to Ma Zuyin, who swept his foot, and the ball went into the net. After the Sichuan team scored two consecutive goals, their momentum was stronger. Guanghua's Jiang Zhaoxiang took advantage of the enemy's rear defense being lax, and stole a camp, secretly crossing the Chencang, and recovered a goal. Soon the time was up. Calculating the total, Guanghua won a big victory over the Sichuan team with six to one. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua Team</p>
<p>Chen Zhijie (up), Ling Xuan (down), Zhao Aisheng, Zheng Dequan (up), Xu Jingcheng (down), Yao Zhenggang, Shi Cheng, Zhou Yanyi (up), Dai Gongbei (down), Chen Shigeng, Luo Douwen (up), Deng Ruiai (down), Xu Jingcheng (up), Li Zumian (down), Jiang Zhaoxiang, Dong Changzhao (up), Gu Dingxiang (down)</p>

<h3>Little Men (65)</h3>
<p>— Original by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Fortunately, the dangerous situation was soon escaped. Mrs. Pei ordered the children to go back to sleep, leaving only the steward to watch out for a recurrence of the fire. Then she and Frang went to see how the unfortunate children were doing. Xiaoqiao only suffered a burn and a large scar. Taomo, not only did most of his hair fall out due to burning, but also had a large burn on his arm, which caused him so much pain that he almost fainted. They soon settled Xiaoqiao, Frang sent him to his own bed, comforting him so that he was no longer afraid, and even hummed a song for him like a loving mother, so that he fell into a deep sleep. Nasuiche took care of the poor Taomo, trying to reduce his pain. Mrs. Pei went back and forth between him and Xiao Tanddi, holding cotton, oil, and pain medicine in her hands, and often muttered to herself, as if she felt quite happy when she thought of this, saying, "I always knew that Tao Mo would set the house on fire one day, and now he has realized this sentence!"</p>
<p>The next morning, Mr. Zhuang came home and saw this mess. Taomo was trapped in bed, Tanddi was panting like a small whale, Mrs. Shu was extremely exhausted, and all the children were very nervous. When they saw him, they all wanted to tell him the story of last night, and they dragged him to survey the burnt field. He handled everything with a calm attitude, and everything gradually returned to order, because everyone felt that with him there, even ten big fires would be enough for him to handle, and everyone worked hard to do whatever work he assigned to them.</p>

<h3>Heavenly Market's Uneventful Trading; Gold Market Increasingly Dull; British Silver Rises! Then Falls Back 2.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market was even more listless yesterday, with a trading range of only 3.5 yuan for the entire day. Major players continued to wait for opportunities. The trend, like the day before, saw an initial decline followed by a rebound, largely due to the central bank periodically injecting cash. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed strength in British silver and stability in American silver. Large traders claimed that after the close, there was talk of the US Treasury buying in the near term above the listed price of 0.025. Forward silver prices in Montgomery fell by 5 to several tenths of a cent. Exchange rates continued to contract. London spot gold rose 2.5 pence. Reports indicated many factors unfavorable to bullish sentiment. Moreover, runaway inflation made it even more difficult to boost morale. Over-the-counter trading opened lower at 83 yuan. Although Fu Xing and Yong entered the market, sales by Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, and Yong Li caused a further drop to around 1.5 yuan. Hui Xiang, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, Yong, and Wan Xing took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price up to 1.5 yuan. Da Da and Yong Li continued to sell. The morning opened with a low range, and the market remained sluggish. However, after the Central Bank announced its official exchange rates, with both British and American rates remaining stable, the sea gold unit rose by 0.04 yuan. The standard gold price was listed up to 6.4 yuan. Confidence returned, and banks began to settle their accounts. The domestic market tightened slightly, boosting buying interest and causing prices to gradually rise. HSBC announced its official exchange rates, with both British and American rates stable. Large traders from Dalian and Japanese banks sold Sterling abundantly, hindering the price increase. The market then declined. Subsequently, banks engaged in considerable interbank trading, with limited demand in the market, leading to a stagnant market with no changes. Later, as the Hong Kong market eased slightly, banks disposed of US dollars, causing the domestic market to harden and decline. However, sentiment remained calm, and prices found support after the decline. Although the forecast for Indian silver was an increase of 0.04 anna, the situation remained stable at noon, largely because the central bank continued to inject cash, leading sellers to temporarily take a wait-and-see approach. Although the market was calm in the afternoon, the supply of funds was scarce, while buying interest remained strong, causing the market to tighten. Despite bank interventions, the reported increase in Indian silver to 0.07 anna only led to a slight fluctuation midway through the day. Buying interest remained strong, and the market ultimately closed higher. However, major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the market soon returned to a consolidation phase, resulting in an extremely lackluster market. Later, after Indian silver rose again by 0.01 anna, the market finally eased. The following is a record of today's trading.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 882 yuan, down 3.5 yuan from the previous close. Yong Li and Da Da sold down to 1 yuan. After the Central Bank announced its official exchange rates and customs gold units rose 0.04 yuan, market sentiment remained stable. Fu Xing, Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Heng, and Hui Xiang bought, pushing the price up to 1.9 yuan. The Chartered Bank bid 4.275 for October Sterling. Fu Xing, Yong, Da De Cheng, Qing Fa, and Yong Shang sold, causing the price to drop to 3 yuan. Chang Da, Ding Kang, Yuan Heng, and Da Fa, Yong, Da Da, and Yong Li continued to buy, pushing the price up to 4.5 yuan. It was predicted that the HSBC official exchange rates would remain unchanged, and the market would consolidate. Chun Yuan, Yong, Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Ri Chang, Yuan Mao, Yong Da Da, Da Fa, Heng Yu, and others took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the price to retreat to 1.8 yuan. Heng Yu, Fu Xing, and Yong Jin bought, pushing the price back up to 1.5 yuan. Japanese banks continued to sell. Yong Li and Yi Feng, and individual investors sold, causing the price to retreat to 2.2 yuan. At this point, the market was inactive, with limited trading. Fu Xing and Yong Da De Cheng continued to buy, pushing the price up to 3.6 yuan. Individuals and Fu Xing and Yong Shen Feng sold, and the Hong Kong market hardened, causing a drop to 1.3 yuan. Fu Tai Heng, Heng Chang, Yong Chun Yuan, and Yong took advantage of this to maintain the price, pushing it up to 1.5 yuan. Indian silver was predicted to rise by 0.04 anna. Although Da De Cheng sold, Heng Yu, Heng Chang, Yong Da Da, Fu Xing, and Yong bought, soon pushing the price up to 3.5 yuan. Da Cheng took advantage of the high price to provide funds, and the market closed at 882.8 yuan. The market was calm after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 882.7 yuan. Ren Da and Yong Li bought, pushing the price from 2.6 yuan to 3.8 yuan. The Chartered Bank injected 0.5 yuan of October US dollars. Xing, Yong, Heng Yu, and Da De Cheng sold down to 1.1 yuan. Da Da, Yong Li, Da De Cheng, Heng Chang, Yong, and others bought again, pushing the price up to 4 yuan. Indian silver was reported to be up 0.07-0.08 anna. Fu Xing, Yong, Yuan Chang, Yong, and Da De Cheng sold, causing the price to drop to 1.1 yuan. Yong Li, Heng Yu, Fu Xing, Yong, Da De Cheng, and others then bought again, and the exchange market also tightened, pushing the price up to 4.5 yuan. Fu Xing and Yong Da De Cheng took advantage of the high price to provide funds, causing the price to drop to 3.3 yuan. Yang Feng and Yong Heng Yu bought, pushing the price back up to just over 4 yuan. However, Fu Xing, Yong Yi, Yong Qing, and Qing Fa Yong still had funds to supply, causing the price to retreat to within 3.5 yuan. The situation was mediocre, with no special changes. However, Yong Li Da Da Da De Cheng became guests, causing the price to drop to 1.1 yuan. Xie Da Xiang Fu Xing Yong Shang bought, causing the market to consolidate. It was said that Indian silver had risen again by 0.01 anna. Yuan Mao, Yong Da De Cheng Hui Lai, and Zhou fell to 1.7 yuan. The market closed at 881.8 yuan, slightly weaker after the close, retreating to around 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's listed standard gold price, was 6 yuan 4 jiao, equivalent to approximately 833 yuan, 4 yuan more than the previous closing price. Term settlements were at 879 yuan for the current month and 888 yuan for October. The supplementary Yong was at 879.99 yuan for the afternoon weekly price. Refined gold was priced at 31 yuan higher, at 885 yuan. The spot market was calm and sluggish, largely because although the Central Bank was injecting funds, its appetite was not very active. Tianjin goods were priced at 6.5 yuan higher, while cooked refined goods were priced at 88 yuan higher, with a lack of transactions. No swaps were reported, but 10 October contracts were transferred from Ying Feng Heng to Yuan Mao Yong, and 14 contracts were transferred to Heng Yu, priced at 882 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In general, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Qing Fa Yong, Zhong Feng, Hui Xiang, Ying Xiang, Chang and others were on the selling side, while Fu Tai Heng, Heng Chang Yong, Yuan Heng, Shun Mao, Tong Tai Chang, Ren Yong Yu Jin Jiang Ding Kang, etc., were on the buying side. Da Cheng and Tian Cheng Chang both advanced and retreated, while Zhi Yong Da Fa Yong Da Yong He advanced after retreating. The big traders from Shanghai made over 500 contracts, successfully entering and exiting the market. Guang Du Sheng, Da Heng Xing also saw little trading.</p>
<p>It was observed that the market situation remained stagnant throughout the day. The opening was at 881 yuan, and the close was at 881.8 yuan. The highest price in the morning session was 884.5 yuan, and the lowest was 881 yuan, a range of only 3.5 yuan. As a result, the market declined by 1.7 yuan compared to the previous day. There were 177 contract settlements for the current month, with 8 long positions and 1 short position. There were 11,615 October contracts, with 4 long positions and 64 short positions. The total volume of transactions was 15,470 contracts in the morning session and only 9,370 contracts in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>Public orders yesterday indicated that short positions had not been unwound, and there was a lack of closing positions today.</p>
<h3>Negative News Dampens Sentiment; Hardening Exchange Market</h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports, London's large traders noted that the US dollar was almost level while British Sterling had risen 0.8825. It was said that after the close, the US Treasury bought silver at 0.06 yuan above the official listed price. Silver prices contracted by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. London spot gold rose 2.5 pence. Sterling against the dollar contracted by 0.25, Sterling against the French franc remained unchanged, the US dollar against Sterling contracted by 0.5, and the US dollar against the French franc contracted by 0.25. The news was unfavorable to buyers, and market sentiment was still weak. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term prices. Sterling was quoted at 6.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 38.125 yuan, reflecting a weakening of 0.0625 for Sterling and a strengthening of 0.125 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the Central Bank announced official exchange rates, British and American rates remained unchanged, and the customs gold unit rose by 0.04 yuan. The market opened slightly calmer. Banks began to purchase Sterling, resulting in immediate tightness. It was anticipated that HSBC's official exchange rates would remain unchanged, with both British and American rates stable. Subsequently, due to banks selling US dollars and large traders from Dalian and Japanese banks selling Sterling, the market became tight. However, interbank trading was quite active, and the process lacked special features. Later, as the Hong Kong market eased slightly, banks sold off US dollars, leading to a hardening of the market. Indian silver was predicted to rise by 0.04 anna, but the market remained mediocre at noon. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants purchased US dollars, causing the domestic market to tighten again. Although banks sold at high prices, the situation was difficult to ease. With Indian silver reported to be up by 0.07 anna, the market remained prosperous. Later, Chinese merchants stopped buying due to high prices, and the market stabilized. Indian silver then rose again by 0.01 anna, slightly easing the market. By the close, the near-term selling price for Sterling was 6.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 38.125 yuan, reflecting a weakening of 0.0625 for Sterling and a strengthening of 0.125 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants sold Sterling slightly and purchased over 300,000 yuan in US dollars. However, large traders from Dalian and Japanese banks continued to sell.

<h3>Securities 公債</h3>
<h3>Multiple Public Bonds Hit New Lows; Hankou Traders Sold Vigorously at Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors in the Chinese Securities Exchange worsened, and traders leaned towards selling. Market sentiment deteriorated, and several market prices broke the low prices of July 11, reaching new lows, indicating a continued downward trend. The market price of the 96 Public Bond remained stubbornly resistant, despite the obvious conflict between its environment and its own absolute value, indicating manipulation by traders. However, caution was advised against the emergence of bullish traders. Yesterday, in the morning, military reduction bonds fell by 0.65 yuan, and reorganization and relief bonds also plummeted by 0.6 yuan. The situation was dangerous, and morale was bewildered. Later, bonds No. 3-4 saw some purchases, and the subsequent decline was slightly mitigated, but still down 0.2-0.4 yuan, with sentiment extremely agitated. Numbers 4, 14 and 16 were the worst performers. Before the midday break, the leading bonds recovered slightly by about 0.1-0.2 yuan, due to some retail investors making purchases. However, demand still exceeded supply, and traders from northern China and bond No. 48 continued to sell vigorously, leading to a renewed weakening, and another decline of 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread further, and buyers became even scarcer. Many traders moved to be ahead of the trend. The price fell again by about 0.1 yuan. At closing, new rumors emerged, and bond No. 40 became the medium for Hankou traders selling vigorously, and the market price fell again by about 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the current situation, the market is filled with rumors. If the situation expands, a further decline of 2-3 yuan is possible. Otherwise, a recovery is also possible. In total, market prices yesterday fell by 0.4-0.5 to 0.95 yuan, with a total turnover of 13,535,000 yuan. The following table compares the results of the price increases and decreases (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton 非常涨風</h3>
<h3>Extremely Strong Upswing in Yarn and Cotton Prices Due to the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing tight conditions due to unrest. Overseas cotton markets are soaring, with high-quality yarns rising by 5 to 6 yuan and low-quality yarns rising by about 3 yuan. Market sentiment is boiling, with prices rising rapidly due to active sales and a lack of inventory for both coarse and fine yarns. The cotton cloth market is also experiencing special developments. The fundamentals of the yarn market are already strong. The labeled yarn market has been suppressed by the number of long positions taken last month to hedge this month, so even minor positive news is fueling an extremely strong price surge.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Down 3.5 Yuan</h3>
<h3>Labeled Yarn Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>In the morning session, labeled yarn prices opened with soaring prices for American and Indian cotton, boosting market sentiment. Prices for all months increased by 5.6 yuan. Long traders, encouraged by favorable news, aggressively added to their positions, while short traders scrambled to cover. Buying was extremely strong, and prices rose steadily, strengthening market sentiment. Prices continued to rise above the previous day's close, with gains ranging from 3 to 4.7 yuan. In the afternoon, continued strong sales of spot yarn and purchasing of 17- and 20-count yarns by the Sichuan traders, following Guangdong and others, prompted factories to sell almost all of their inventory, causing prices to continue to rise. Prices briefly declined by several jiao as some long traders took profits, but prices rebounded by the close, with a strong upward trend. Buyers included Dafeng (1,750 bales), Daji (800 bales), Zhenda (850 bales), Changchang (1,750 bales), Changfeng (950 bales), Tonghe (750 bales), Tongfu (750 bales), Taixing (600 bales), Runkang (650 bales), Yongda (550 bales), Yuan Yi (700 bales), Yi Chang (550 bales), Shen Yu (450 bales), Mingde (450 bales), Hexing (450 bales), and Yongchang (550 bales).

<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Exceed Supply</h3>
<p>Sales of spot yarn to Henan and Guangdong traders were somewhat satisfied, while Sichuan traders aggressively purchased 17- and 20-count yarns, leading to factories being unable to meet demand. Daily transactions totaled 1,850.8 bales, and prices rose by 1 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton</h3>
<p>American and Indian cotton markets have been rising for days. Yesterday, the political news favored bullish sentiment, and prices rose another 35 to 44 pound-cents. The domestic cotton market is increasingly bullish. Short traders are eagerly covering their positions, while long traders are further adding to their positions, driving the market upward. As yarn factory inventories gradually run out, there is a potential for active consumption of raw cotton, further boosting bullish sentiment.</p>
<h3>Labeled Cotton Rises Dramatically by 1.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Labeled cotton prices opened higher across the board, as external cotton prices rose sharply due to the potential for war in Europe and Africa. Prices for all months rose suddenly by 5.6 jiao. From the second session, market sentiment became even more bullish. Short traders, aware of the unfavorable situation, eagerly covered their positions, while long traders continued to add to their positions, causing the trading platform to become increasingly tight and prices to soar. The afternoon session opened with a more bullish market, as sales of spot yarn remained strong and there was potential for active sales of spot cotton. During the third session, due to a greater number of profit-taking closures, the price dropped a few jiao, but recovered by the close.</p>

<h3>Grain: Italian-Albanian Mobilization Spurs Flour and Wheat Surge</h3>
<p>The flour market presented another frenzied surge, with shore wheat prices in Chicago continuing to rise by one dollar, a considerable amount. Canadian prices rose by ninety cents. Market sentiment, due to the frequent surges in foreign wheat and the looming Italian-Albanian dispute, has shifted towards bullishness. Opening prices surged by three to four points, but later selling by major bulls eased the momentum slightly. However, the market surged again in the afternoon due to a Reuters telegram reporting a formal conflict between Italy and Albania, prompting widespread buying from both industry insiders and outsiders. Bids for all months aggressively rose. Given the seriousness of the international situation, future developments are bound to be disruptive.</p>

<h3>Weather Clears, River Rice Arrives in Quantity, Prices Plunge</h3>

Yesterday, the market saw four hundred and seventy bags of Yangzhou sesame, four hundred and thirty bags of Nanjing sesame, three hundred and twenty bags of Zhangbaling sesame, four hundred and thirty bags of Chenzhou sesame, over one hundred bags of new Chenzhou sesame, over two hundred and forty bags of Guandian sesame, eighty-seven bags of Youpu sesame, and over twenty bags of Jiujiang sesame. Yangzhuang clean goods are temporarily without a market as cargo holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. According to foreign firm sources, around eight yuan and five jiao per dan, perhaps there can be three or four hundred tons of trading.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Sales Reported Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate has been extended, and overseas silk prices have also gradually trended downward (New York is down four cents compared to last week, Yokohama is down fifty yuan). However, Shanghai manufacturers are still holding prices firm and are optimistic about the future, unwilling to sell easily. As a result, silk trading in Shanghai is reported quiet.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Fine Eyebrow Tea Sells Actively in Europe</h3>

<h3>Children Also Need Books</h3>
<p>— By Lin Side</p>
<p>Luther Burbank said: "Children like to play with mud pies, catch grasshoppers, crickets, water bugs, tadpoles, frogs, and turtles; pick elderberries, wild raspberries, acorns, and chestnuts; climb trees, play with water, fold lotus flowers; they are willing to do all these things. They love to catch gophers, bats, bees, butterflies, and all kinds of animals. Picking pine cones, rolling stones, scattering sand, slithering, and playing with bumblebees in the grass are things that no child has ever restrained themselves from, and restraining themselves from these things is like restraining a part of their good education." (Note 1)</p>
<p>To the things that Burbank proposed children should have, we can add one more point, which is that every child should have their books.</p>
<p>Finding fun in characters and taking pleasure in the sound of books has always been considered a kind of recreational activity. Reading is a tool for culture, and it has already been recognized by the world. It is necessary for education. However, 'education,' from the time we have had it until now, has never safeguarded the individual reading wishes of those receiving education. This is simply a bizarre contradiction. Speaking of valuing and using books, it often faces opposition due to the cultivation required, so some have said that only a small portion of adults actually read. Among them, the number of readers who can distinguish and find interest in ancient and modern texts is ultimately small. Even in the United States, which is known for its extensive education, according to the reading situation in 1926, "Out of 160 million people in America, there are almost 50 million readers, but most of these 90 million readers do not read other books besides the daily news and soft novels." (Note 2) The number of people who truly seek knowledge in books and appreciate profound literature is also extremely small. So now we know that to study children, we must find the importance and possibility of books in their young environment. We are not saying that we should often lock children indoors to pore over their dictionaries or push a Bible onto their seats, nor are we completely overturning their building of small houses to replace them with encyclopedias, but rather that from the time they can pick up their cloth-covered books, they are qualified to use their bookshelves and pictures.</p>
<p>If a child has the ability to dress, eat, and sleep alone, then naturally, they also have the ability to use their books. A child's dressing and sleeping naturally cannot be the same as those of adults, and even in terms of diet, it cannot be the same. Because they are infants, special care and nurturing are given to their genuine nature, and their physical development is strengthened and increased with time. Books and children, just like their beds, help them complete themselves, making them fully realized. That is to say, books can give children good and usable abilities.</p>
<p>Moore said, "Children must grow up from their books, and the selection of those books must be carefully considered in all aspects of life, while also matching the child's natural interests and never containing extravagant qualities. The most important thing is to pay attention to their mental and spiritual development and changes, just like giving them good food to maintain their bodies. In addition, we must also anticipate their purchasing power, that is, the value of the selected books must be within each family's budget." (Note 3)</p>
<p>What Moore said about choosing books for children should be "universal to people" is an excellent idea, but we still need to discuss the following: what methods do we use for the smallest children? How do we make two-year-olds use books? And how do we make books something a child can develop social and intellectual needs for? These are some questions.</p>
<p>To know whether a career is satisfying and beneficial, which is something we continue throughout our lives, the reading habits of adults, such as seeking knowledge and entertainment in books, are gradually learned and must be learned from the beginning for them to gain satisfying experiences from books. So, it is extremely obvious that if we want children to love books and hope to connect their lives with reading habits, then naturally we should provide them with this kind of progressive creative experience. However, among the currently popular books, who can judge which ones can provide to small children?</p>
<p>Speaking of children having some actions that are often annoying, they are often disliked by adults. In fact, these complex factors cannot be resolved simply by dislike. We still need to slowly teach them to do things. "For example, if we want children to hold books properly, it definitely requires an adult to kindly guide them." We see a child holding a splendid and pleasing book, sitting on a patch of green grass. The glossy pages rustle, and their skillful and discerning fingers draw blue, red, or yellow marks, (Note 4) how free and easy is that!</p>
<p>Children are extremely fond of books. Previously, there were two students in a nursery who spent a whole day looking at picture books, and their ages were about two and a half years old. One day, one of the children ran out of the room because of something, and as he got up from the chair and walked out, he suddenly dropped his book on the floor. Another child saw this and carefully picked it up, gently placed it on the table, and solemnly scolded the child, saying, "You can't do that; books are good things!" This kind of situation is solid evidence—and at the same time, we think of the expression that child emitted when he said those words, how meaningful!</p>
<p>But in reality, what can we do? In families, limited by budget and with several children, or with limited space or time, can we help children know what kind of books are "good things"? So the first important plan is that we must be able to dedicate time and money independently. Within our families, we must treat books as an essential part of a child's life and respect books and give books a serious place. This does not mean that we are dominated by books but rather that books have a limited place in our lives, like constantly using entertainment, knowledge, and abilities as tools. If we hold such an attitude, we will be worthy of our children. Walking into this kind of exemplary family, their respect for children can still suit the child's behavior. As for the child's fundamental necessities, they are naturally what parents plan for them. Like the purchase of those harmful books, there must be preparation in the family budget, equal to providing rooms for children to live in and allowing children to have entertainment time.</p>
<p>All of the contributions of these methods are that buying those books for children is not an overly wasteful request. It is hoped that inspiration like this will enlighten a child until they become an adult. Books are food for the child's body and wine for the spirit. Books can give them the right methods, have shared and friendly uses within the family, help their lives move from the boundaries of the family to the larger world, and provide them with life experiences that allow them to distinguish the taste of life. Therefore, even infants need books.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p>— By Xiao Ge</p>
<p>There were six of them. After being stuffed with white liquor, they still had official business to attend to.</p>
<p>They walked staggeringly, still busy picking their teeth, unwilling to leave the chicken scraps in their teeth.</p>
<p>Their official business was to walk into a silk store.</p>
<p>"Where's the manager?" As usual, the old man always led the official business, and his three strands of beard added a bit of prestige.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" The fat guy stood up from the stool.</p>
<p>"We're apportioning some money for river works and tea water. Are you the manager?" The toothpick was dropped on the ground.</p>
<p>"N-no... but we've already hired river workers."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, you've hired river workers, of course you pay them wages. But... but for the sake of the poor..."</p>
<p>"I say, is the flood coming or not?"</p>
<p>"No, no... so the poor folks who are assigned to work have no way, they have to eat, they also have to drink tea, so in our several baoli, we have to find a way to subsidize them. It's for everyone's sake, manager, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"But these days!" He gestured with his hand.</p>
<p>"These days, you don't want to live?" The young guy who came along was a bit fiery in his speech, and the old man gave him a look.</p>
<p>The manager didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Didn't the first dike collapse?"</p>
<p>"Heard that × village has also been flooded!"</p>
<p>The shop assistants were most concerned about these things.</p>
<p>"Now, 100,000 laborers are working day and night to repair the second dike. × village only has two chi of water."</p>
<p>"If the water rises again, it'll be ruined!"</p>
<p>"Yes, so we still have to do our best. Manager, isn't it?"</p>
<p>The manager had already quietly sat down in the corner of the wall, and the old man walked over.</p>
<p>"Manager is..."</p>
<p>"So how much money do you want me to pay?" The fat guy shook his head on the chair.</p>
<p>"Five yuan, we're apportioning five yuan."</p>
<p>"Five yuan!" He stood up angrily.</p>
<p>"We have records."</p>
<p>He pulled out a few pieces of paper and spread them on the glass counter, but the manager didn't look at them, took a few angry steps, and said decisively:</p>
<p>"Baoli chief, you do the math for me, four laborers are assigned every day, four sixes are twenty-four, that's two yuan and four mao per day. You also want tea water, and what else, people can't afford it!"</p>
<p>"So are you paying or not?" The young guy got fiery again, and the veins on his red face swelled up a bit.</p>
<p>"How can people afford it?" He tilted his body.</p>
<p>"If you don't pay, we'll send you to the Public Security Bureau!"</p>
<p>"Public Security Bureau, good, let's go!"</p>
<p>The manager heroically walked to the door, but the old man caught up and grabbed him.</p>
<p>"Let's talk it over, let's talk it over. The young guys are just fiery tempered."</p>
<p>"I'm going, I'm going to get sued!"</p>
<p>The shop assistants all came forward to persuade him, and the fiery young guy hid at the door, roaring. A crowd of people gathered around to watch, it was very lively.</p>
<p>Another disturbance rose in the street.</p>
<p>A group of coolies walked by, and the one in the lead held a bamboo pole with a string of more than a dozen sugar ears on it.</p>
<p>"Everyone look, four people eating one !"</p>
<p>"We're not doing it anymore!"</p>
<p>"Spent other people's money, enjoying themselves."</p>
<p>"Damn his brother-in-law!"</p>
<p>A burst of shouting, the excitement in the silk store shifted to the street. The manager ran out the door first, looked around, and ran back in, bumping into the old man.</p>
<p>"What's going on? What's going on?"</p>
<p>The six of them caught up with a group.</p>
<p>"What's going on? Four people eating one ."</p>
<p>"I fuck your mother!"</p>
<p>"Who are you cursing?" The old man panted and struggled to keep up, unable to stop them.</p>
<p>"Cursing those brothers-in-law who spend other people's money and enjoy themselves."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Outrageous! I'm going to take you to see the district chief."</p>
<p>"Good, let's go!"</p>
<p>The six of them and this group quickly walked away.</p>
<h3>Character Splitting Stall</h3>
<h3>Honorary Old Woman (II)</h3>
<p>— By Jiang Maxiu, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>However, as I reflected on this influence, I couldn't help but feel afraid.</p>
<p>The events unfolded one after another. The situation in the Orient became urgent, and war finally broke out. General patriotic fervor, war fever, mobilization orders, expeditions... Military propaganda gradually became blatant. And it had a considerable effect. Suddenly, from the shadows of the screen, the sound of children singing in chorus to send off the soldiers came up. - In that instant, both my wife and I couldn't help but feel a chill in our hearts.</p>
<p>However, the general audience only had fanaticism.</p>
<p>After a while, the attacks on Lushun, the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, and the fierce battles of Fengtian unfolded. In these performances, the Japanese army had special forces open fire for backup, and the actors were actively active. I thought this was great. I even thought that although a few anti-militarists had tried to carry out various forms of resistance, preventing the influence of propaganda aided by the state was not an easy task.</p>
<p>Next, I felt as if I was experiencing the era of the Russo-Japanese War again. Because at that time, I was still a small middle school student in the countryside, and like the general public, I had been caught up in that dazzling and violent vortex of patriotic fervor and war fever. In fact, has there ever been a time when the people were more united in the fanaticism of patriotism and militarism than at that time? Now, watching this "Colonel Yoshioka" movie, I remembered the tension and fanaticism of the general public and atmosphere of twenty years ago, and I couldn't help but feel a kind of nostalgia.</p>
<p>However, my wife was much younger than me and did not live directly in that era. Therefore, she had no understanding of my emotions at all. And this "Colonel Yoshioka," especially the war scenes, she could only see the tragic, cruel, and disgusting things in them. Therefore, when leaving the cinema, she said that she really regretted not going home without watching this movie.</p>
<p>I didn't think her feelings were unreasonable at all. No, it was probably natural. However, as mentioned earlier, I had a kind of nostalgia for remembering that era.</p>
<h3>The Birth of a Baby</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>Before my wife went into labor, I had already started to worry. This, for us, was nothing short of a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Our impoverished existence had long plunged us into a life of wandering and instability. Every day, we wracked our brains just to secure meager meals that barely filled our bellies. Every year, we racked our brains trying to find ways to obtain clothes that barely kept us warm. Despite exhausting all our life's strength to resist the onslaught of hunger and cold, we still ended up enduring hunger and freezing, and practically not a single day out of the 360 days of the year was a good one for us.</p>
<p>Sorrow and distress seemed to have become part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>We truly had an indescribable sense of melancholy regarding these unfortunate, difficult, and bleak years!</p>
<p>Now, what threatened me before my eyes was that my wife was about to give birth. For wealthy families, or people longing for descendants, this would be a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>However, for us struggling under the iron wheels of life, we felt no joy whatsoever. On the contrary, this matter made us even more immersed in anxiety.</p>
<p>My wife was giving birth for the first time, and because she had never experienced this before, she was particularly worried about her life. In the past, she had heard stories of difficult childbirths from the mouths of neighbors. Thus, the cruel image of death, the tragic impression of death, and the terrifying face of death had deeply penetrated my wife's pure heart, adding a layer of gloom to her life and leaving a larger wound.</p>
<p>I, too, had the same feeling. I did not think my wife's worries and fears were excessive. However, my wife's constitution was too frail, due to excessive labor and insufficient nourishment on ordinary days. This was obviously very unfavorable for her childbirth. I thought, how many unhealthy women in the world fail to pass through the ordeal of childbirth!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel terrified and worried for my wife, and thus became anxious for her.</p>
<p>But, apart from worry, what good methods could we use to remedy the situation? This was as necessary as daily food and clothing. Could we stop that kind of natural human demand? Alas, the poor of this century are even deprived of a natural human pleasure.</p>
<p>My wife was very anxious because she was nearing labor. She dragged her heavy belly everywhere to find a solution. But after running around for several days, all our friends were as poor as us.</p>
<p>As for me, in the past, when I still had a job, if I was short of money in the middle of the month, I could still borrow from others. But now, it was no longer possible. They knew that we had no income and were poor, unable to repay debts, so they dared not lend to us with peace of mind.</p>
<p>So what should we do? Were we just to listen to the manipulation of misfortune?</p>
<p>Today, my wife's labor pains became even more obvious. Her stomach was in constant throes of pain, as if a venomous snake were biting her intestines. She tossed and turned on the bed, moaning and wailing. Hearing these sounds, my tears streamed down.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is the struggle of life!" I said to myself.</p>
<p>My wife gradually became exhausted. Thirsty, hungry, she wanted to eat something sour. So I gave her a piece of pineapple (it was canned, a gift from a friend). My wife took it, bit into it twice, and immediately spat it out. The thing seemed to have rotted. I thought: it must be old stock, the friend bought it cheaply.</p>
<p>"Then, have some congee." My wife nodded.</p>
<p>However, she simply couldn't eat it. In the past, we were people who could restrain ourselves and eat a lot. How could there be a reason to not happily eat something when we had it?</p>
<p>"This is the nature of childbirth!" I said to my wife. My wife nodded weakly in pain.</p>
<p>After a lull of less than half an hour, my wife suddenly cried out again. Turning over, her face was pale. That kind of embarrassing and pale countenance made me suspect that I was standing before a critically ill patient. At this moment, the terror and cruelty of death, the pain and bleakness of death, suddenly penetrated my heart again.</p>
<p>Alas, what to do? The hope of hiring a midwife was gone, I was an "outsider" myself, and Zhang next door had gone to the countryside. Relatives were far away from here…</p>
<p>Suddenly, my wife's frantic cry was even more shrill than before. Her forehead was beaded with sweat, her hands pressing on the bed board, a burst of powerless moans, followed by a burst of blood, from there, bathed in purplish-red blood, an innocent baby appeared.</p>
<p>He cried loudly, his voice already containing a kind of worldly suffering.</p>
<p>In this way, my wife luckily escaped the "firing line," but from now on, another burden has been added to our lives!</p>

<h3>Thoughts on "World Animal Day"</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>According to reports, the China Animal Protection Association has obtained the approval of the Executive Yuan to designate October 4th as "World Animal Day," ordering the Ministry of the Interior to instruct governments at all levels to issue notices, exempting slaughter for one day on that day.</p>
<p>And now, this holiday has actually arrived. Whether "military and civilian personnel at all levels" have complied with the order not to eat meat, we naturally cannot know. However, even if everyone does not kill today, I think that once today is over, the animals trapped in cages will definitely not escape their fate of being slaughtered. I remember that it was customary to buy carp to release on "Kitchen God Day." I think this is more straightforward than exempting slaughter for one day (although the former has a purpose). In fact, they arrive at the same destination by different routes: neither can save the lives of the animals.</p>
<p>In the past, there were stories of "long-lived sheep," where people "could not bear to eat their meat upon hearing their cries," but once they turned their backs, they could even "eat human flesh" without any qualms. Therefore, since ancient times, the act of people killing people has continued endlessly, and those who are killed are mostly the weak, like "long-lived sheep." Eleven or twelve years ago, a massacre was staged in Europe. One year after that, many bullies are sharpening their knives in a hurry.</p>
<p>Preachers always attribute people's lives to heaven. Last year's drought and this year's flood are all natural disasters. Therefore, some people say that the lower realm has offended the heavens, so slaughter must be banned and good deeds must be done. As a result, disaster victims are still displaced, die, and wander... However, "benevolent" people still hide in foreign-style houses, and not a grain of rice is given in alms. Moreover, some people will take the opportunity to make a fortune! What is this thing after all: is it benevolence, or is it compassion? ...</p>
<p>Today is a day of exempting slaughter, but what about tomorrow? Are people willing to lay down their butcher knives? — Although I don't worry for the animals, I worry for humanity!</p>
<h3>Old Residence</h3>
<p>— Tang Wen</p>
<p>I visited a friend but didn't find him at home, so I went to visit my former landlord.</p>
<p>It was in the winter three years ago. After recovering from a serious illness, the doctor instructed me to rest for some time before working. Through a friend's introduction, I rented a corner of a small building here for the lowest rent. The small building faced a park. Every morning, I took a book I loved to read or a newspaper and found a quiet place in the park to read, quietly passing the lonely morning. The landlord was a widower in middle age, with a nine-year-old child studying in elementary school. He himself worked in a bank. When I moved in, it was difficult for us to meet except on Sundays. I got up early, getting up at six o'clock every day, ate a snack, and went to the park across the street, so I often met the newspaper deliveryman's bicycle at the door. I also went to bed early at night. His return time was uncertain. Even if he returned at five o'clock, knowing that I had the habit of going to bed early, only I would go downstairs to meet him. He would never come upstairs, and at that time, the status between guest and host was still maintained. We always had aimless small talk. He was a Catholic. On Sunday mornings, he took his children to church for worship. In the afternoon, we had the opportunity to sit and talk. But after that winter, he lost his job, saying that the bank was laying off employees. That day, he seemed very excited. He came upstairs to my room, took my hand and said: From now on, I will return to my free body! After a few months of cohabitation, we still had not spoken frankly about our own affairs. Although his attitude seemed so sincere that day, I might have thought that he had lost his job a long time ago and said such negative words. I encouraged him like an ordinary friend at the time. He shook his head and held my hand tighter and said:</p>
<p>"My relationship with that bank is very superficial, but my father saved the bank from a crisis when he was alive. After my father died, they gave me a position at will, and they were so generous because there was still a little unfinished business of my father's that needed me to take responsibility for. Then my dismissal was expected a long time ago, but it was just a matter of time. This world completely takes money as the source of power! If it weren't for my father's unfinished responsibility</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>I wouldn't want to float and sink in this place of fame and profit."</p>
<p>From this conversation onwards, our friendship progressed a step further. He had some assets. His current responsibility was to educate his only son. When his wife was dying, she instructed him to remarry her younger sister and treat her flesh and blood well, but he firmly refused to remarry. After that, the pain of his life experience was revealed in the usual conversations. He said that now that he has this free body, he wants to read some books well and learn music to complete his twilight years. Of course, a middle-aged person should not be so negative, but because I sympathize with him, I can no longer say some irrelevant words of encouragement like an ordinary friend.</p>
<p>We lived together for half a year. For the sake of life, I still floated and sank in this place of fame and profit with my weak body. Once I had a job, I was busy running around, and it was rare to have a holiday to wander around my old residence for a day. It has been a few months since I last saw him.</p>
<p>Walking closer to the small building, a melodious piano sound came from the front. I saw the corner of the small building where I had lived for half a year, with green curtains fluttering. A bunch of carnations stretched out their flowers on the window sill. The inner walls also seemed to have been renovated. Listening to the piano sound, it was coming from the building. Although I don't understand what music is being played, the bright piano sound tells me that the musician must be in a happy mood. Perhaps my old friend is playing a piece of music after waking up from a nap, and it is Sunday today, so his son must be waiting by his side. Thinking of this, I felt that my friend was still happy, and I couldn't help but speed up my pace. I pressed the doorbell on the familiar steps, hoping that his son would jump out like a bird, take my hand, and shout "Dad" while running upstairs. But the door was opened by an unfamiliar old woman. I said I wanted to see her master. The old woman replied that her master was in Mogan Mountain and had not returned, and the two young ladies were in Shanghai. I asked about their surname. It turned out that my old friend and his son had gone to another place two months ago, and this small building had changed owners. I wanted to know more details, but the old woman shook her head and closed the door.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the door, feeling lost, I heard the piano sound playing melodiously again inside.</p>
<h3>To Changsha</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>(The Changsha mentioned here is not the resounding Changsha in Hunan, but a relatively famous Changsha Island near the sea in our Guangdong.)</p>
<p>Before taking a ferry from Guangzhou to Sanbu to Changsha, I spent a night on the sea. In autumn, the sea at night is very beautiful. The calm river water flows gently, completely unlike the turbulent sea, which flashes dangerous and charming silvery-white waves. However, the river surface at night here also has many intoxicating shadows, as if it has reached a poetic and alluring realm. Although I can't see the singing and dancing girls wearing enchanting clothes like in the city, I can hear the rustling wind in the calm countryside plains. This faint and heart-soaking wind has a certain rhythm. Who says it's not charming! On the river surface on such a silent night, hearing it is like hearing the song of poetry! Therefore, I always forget the time to sleep, pacing quietly on the deck, my eyes looking at a distant and hazy wilderness. Wilderness! It was blown by the wind swept over from the South China Sea, like countless girls swaying and twisting their waists. Even when I looked up at the sky, the clear sky was covered with countless stars. Who says the river at night is not beautiful! So, my heart unknowingly melted into the beautiful rural travel. Yes, in Shanghai, I have never had such happiness, never had such a feeling.</p>
<p>When I had heard enough of the wind howling and the rushing river water flowing, and I was tired and it was time to go to sleep, I hid in the cabin, dreaming and praying for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow I will be in Changsha! That is a sandbar surrounded by rivers! There should be many beautiful scenery there for me to enjoy! The young wanderer thought so.</p>
<p>When I woke up the next day, the sun hadn't climbed up earlier than me. I ran to the deck again, breathing the light and fresh air, and looking at the quiet scenery on both sides of the river. When the boat passed Gongyi, the sun was just climbing out, and the entire earth was covered with bright red and gorgeous clothes. The green mountain peaks and the green forests were all flashing with red clouds! This lovely morning is not something I could enjoy when I was wandering in Shanghai.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Changsha, I could see a new place, three ports - Xinchang, Dihai and Changsha - standing side by side next to the sea. The buildings are all like Guangzhou, neat and beautiful. Yes, this is also a place built with the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. On the one hand, Changsha Island, in addition to the distant and vast plains and villages in the bamboo forests, is the long street market. This place is not very strange. I traveled here in earlier years. Now, I can call it revisiting an old place. Yes, I love this place very much, because this big sandbar is very interesting. If a few friends use a small boat to circle the entire island for a week at dusk, it will only take four or five hours, but we can see many natural and unadorned scenery, completely unlike the West Lake, which is dyed with the colors of the capitalist market, and even more unlike the hypocrisy of the prosperous and dead big city! If you take a walk in the criss-crossing fields, the charming posture of the green rice fields is all simple, and although the scenery of this place is not bright, basically, if it is decorated a little, I always believe that it is a very famous sandbar park. (But, then I won't be happy to come and visit!)</p>
<p>Isn't that right? I have a habit and a hobby. I love to eat fresh rapeseed more than anything else. This is a place famous for producing fruit.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Changsha Pier, I carried my simple luggage around the streets. At the end of the streets is Zhongshan Park, which is full of lotus leaves in the ponds. Yes, that is the school where I am going to stay. When our friends came out to pick me up, I saw more than 300 children, beautiful girls, all looking at me with cheerful and kind eyes. So, I unknowingly mixed with the naughty and innocent children. Everything was as lovely as the morning sun. When the children all left, I leaned on the railings of the third floor to look at the public countries in front, the distant and curved river water, the flat buildings, and breathed the fresh air. So, everything dispelled the depression in my heart.</p>
<h3>The Whole Family is in the Autumn Wind</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Liu Bing</p>
<p>Maybe it's just my personal bias, but after coming to Tokyo, everything makes me feel very fresh. Friend, because you are also curious, I will tell you what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>The first thing that made me feel fresh after coming to Tokyo was the Japanese people's clothing. Of course, in Shanghai, you often see Japanese people's clothes, but in Shanghai, young girls have already worn Western clothes. It may be very rare to see a young girl wearing Eastern clothes, so this makes me feel fresh. When I arrived, it was the time of late summer and early autumn. They all put bright, large floral patterns on their bodies, with two sleeves dragging down to their knees, and their hair separated into two halves at the back. Walking, they are lively and quiet. When we look at them from behind, we will think of a beautiful butterfly. I once went to a dance hall with a friend. There, I saw dancers wearing brightly colored "kimonos." Their sleeves were even longer and bigger. When they danced, their sleeves fluttered in the wind, which was really beautiful.</p>
<p>In the eyes of us foreigners, the clothing of Japanese women seems to be roughly the same. In fact, its changes are no less than the cheongsam of our country's women. Not only does the style change from time to time, but the patterns also change with the seasons. Therefore, whenever the season is about to change, major companies display dozens of new spring or autumn "visiting clothes" from 1935 on a certain floor. The styles and patterns are very gorgeous. The so-called "visiting clothes" are the most important and precious clothes in "kimono," which are worn when going out or visiting friends. They are very expensive, some costing several hundred yen a day. Just a visiting belt also costs more than thirty yen. The pattern styles of these "visiting clothes" are all designed by designers in "kimono shops." Every change in pattern style, even if it is so subtle that we cannot see it, Japanese women know whether it is a popular pattern at a glance. However, these are naturally limited to idle wives and young ladies. As for those working women, such as female ticket sellers and maids, they have no time to pay attention to these.</p>
<p>Men's clothing is relatively simple. In addition to wearing "kimonos," many people already wear "suits" for convenience at work. However, their suits are also very casual. It doesn't matter if they are wider or narrower, and the style is even less of a concern for which year. Even if you wear the style of 1925, you are far from the people of 1935. Unlike our country's personnel departments, after people, only decorations must be the first to grab. Before 1935 has arrived, the style of 1936 will be out of date.</p>
<p>Speaking of the clothing of Japanese students, it is even more worth noting. Whether in elementary, middle, or university, male and female students must wear student uniforms. At the same time, they absolutely do not pay attention to it, and they are even proud of wearing old and worn student uniforms. Some students use their hats to wipe tables and benches, so that the hats are worn to a shiny mirror surface, which is enough to show their qualifications. And the students of the Imperial University also hang a towel on their garter, hanging outside. Walking, swaying, it simply makes you laugh, but they take this as "spirited," so our Chinese students studying in Japan, after a long time, also learn the appearance of Japanese students, hiding their good suits and wearing student uniforms all day long.</p>
<p>There are many styles of female students' clothing, but most wear skirts and shirts. They value skirts very much. Wearing skirts means being polite. Their skirts are all added on the outside, bloated and unbearable. Although we laugh when we see it, they think that this is the polite behavior of intellectuals.</p>
<p>The clothing of Chinese students studying in Japan, if they come from the country for the first time, will not change for a while, and many still wear beautiful suits. Therefore, everyone says, "East Asian students are the most fashionable." In fact, this means that they are new to Tokyo and are not yet qualified to wear student uniforms. After a year or half a year, they will naturally change. However, it is more difficult for women to change. No matter how many years they live in Tokyo, they always like to wear cheongsams, which is probably because they are more comfortable and convenient.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongshuo</p>
<p>I have become more and more lonely recently. I have become quite interested in the Buddhist teachings of Zen Buddhism, but I am still very young and unwilling to let my life be tainted with negativity. This self-reflection is a skill that I have only recently developed.</p>
<p>Thinking of my depravity, I inevitably tend to be on the road to degeneration, so I cheer up my cold heart again, and pay attention to people, things, and learning. However, a more serious life provokes the hatred of friends. A lonely personality is not a talent, but a result of the environment.</p>
<p>The change of seasons has given me some stimulation. The rustling autumn wind blows my disheveled hair, and it has also made me feel lonely and desolate. I have also expressed sympathetic pity for those withered and yellow fallen leaves. A small boat on the river has also aroused a lot of poetic and pictorial ideas, but after all, I am not a painter with a skillful hand and have not painted this natural picture on paper. I am also not a poet and have not chanted this beautiful scenery into a clear and easy-to-read poem. All my experiences are expressed between the lines. I have also cursed my own shallowness.</p>
<p>It is autumn. The river water is no longer as turbid as in summer, but facing the turbulent waves, I seem to have gained this enlightenment: life should be like the tide, advancing bravely and destroying all thorns and fences!</p>
<p>Many people come here from distant places in this season of high autumn, clear sky, gentle breeze and warm sunshine. Perhaps the vast river arouses their infinite interest, or perhaps the high tower standing on the bank of the river gives them a lot of thoughts of nostalgia. They come in batches and go in batches.</p>
<p>The maple leaves on the mountain are already red, swaying in the wind like a shy girl dancing. I remember that Suiyuan once had these two lines of poetry about maple trees: "Sometimes falling at will on the grass, there is no such pitiful red in the flowers." It is really a vivid portrayal.</p>

<h3>Ballad Singing</h3>

<p>Dong Fang (1020) 11:15 AM to 12:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Sima Xiangru"</p>
<p>Xiangru Sima, styled Changqing. His writing of a thousand words has been passed down through the ages. Traveling in all directions without a companion, lightly packed and simply dressed, he travels through the dust. He first meets Zun. Zhuo Wangsun. In the boudoir there is a daughter named Wenjun. After the mirror is broken and the hairpin is split, she is newly widowed. The empty room is lonely and she guards the dusk. She is familiar with writing and chanting. Leaning on the railing, she enjoys the bright moon. Suddenly, she vaguely hears the sound of the qin. The Jiao Tong plays the melody of the Phoenix Seeking the凰. It stirs up her uncontrollable heart of spring. Unexpectedly, she enters Xiangru's residence at night. Until the market closes, she does not complain of poverty. She pawns a fur coat. The husband and wife get to know each other. A Jiao is lonely in the Changmen Palace. For a long time, she admired Xiangru's talent. She once bought the Rhapsody on Changmen with a thousand gold. In those years, she personally wrote the inscription on the bridge. He gained a high carriage and four horses. As expected, the will of heaven fulfilled his eight desires. He does not dislike the halter-nose trousers. A man can bend and then stretch. It is a pity that he could not cure the root of thirst.</p>

<h3>Electronic Music Medley</h3>
<p>In addition to Yan Fei and Ouyang Feili, Ye Ying and Ye Hongzhang Wen will also go to Taiwan with the Red Leaf Song and Dance Troupe to perform on stage.</p>
<p>Bao Xuexue recently watched a movie with a young man and her bracelet was robbed. Zhou Wenlu, however, enthusiastically inquired at various pawnshops.</p>
<p>A former member of the Rose Troupe was Wu Ju, and the later Miao Yin Troupe also had a member named Wu Gui (pronounced Ju). Yesterday, Wu Gui met and said he wanted to publish a statement, "The one called Turtle is only him. He denies Wu Ju in the singer's pictorial." Truly, Heaven knows!</p>
<p>On October 1st, the Social Daily Broadcasting Circle Jinfeng published "On the 26th, someone went to the Li Li Radio Station to 'see' Zhou Gong, Zhou was not there. It is inevitable to sweep away the fun of the newcomers. Otherwise, it will be a martial arts show of a fight."</p>
<p>Monsters in the radio station continue to emerge in a bad state. I wonder if the silver has the will of Zhuge Liang to do the cleaning work. So-called bending over backward until death. (Above by Tong Lei)</p>
<p>The third issue of the Singer's Pictorial, published by the Singer's Pictorial Society, Houde Lane, Tangjiawan, outside Ximen, Shanghai, has been published today.

In terms of songs, the collection is especially rich, such as Mr. Nie Er's posthumous work "Wounded Soldier Song", Ren Guang's and An E's "Half a Pound of Noodles", Xu Ruhui's "Country Big Girl", Li Jinhui's "Uncrowned Emperor", etc., which are all new creations. The richness of the content is enough to dominate the publishing world. Each book is sold for two silver dollars.

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Heavenly Love's Dubbing Music Orientalized</h3>
<p>In the past, many domestic films were produced with music, but most of them were taken from Western music. Occasionally, some Chinese music was produced, but this so-called Chinese music was just a very common Cantonese tune. As for whether the mixed music can help the performance effect of the play, it is difficult to say. Lianfeng took this dubbing of "Heavenly Love" very seriously. Special talents were hired to continue working day and night, striving to integrate the music with the film to achieve a mixed aesthetic effect. Moreover, the music used is extremely avoided from phonograph record-like rotten tunes. The score should be specially composed for this play, to make it orientalized. Such creation is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Silver Pen Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Wen Er</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Star Film Company laid off 102 junior employees to save expenses. It is said that Mr. Li Pingqian was in charge.</p>
<p>Now, it is rumored that Mr. Li Pingqian will also leave the Star Film Company. The reason? Not detailed.</p>
<p>The news that the Star Film Company has restored the screenwriting department and hired Ouyang Yuqian and Liu Naou as screenwriters has already been revealed in other newspapers.</p>
<p>Let's not mention this here. Let's say that according to the news we heard, it is: in addition to the above two, there is also Huang Tianshi. "Soft as cotton and smooth as oil", under the leadership of Liu Huang and others, the future Star productions will mostly be soft works, right?</p>
<p>After Liu Huang and others were honorably appointed as screenwriters of the Star Film Company, Mr. Yao Suifeng was also honorably appointed as a "special screenwriter" of the Star Film Company. It is said that Mr. Yao originally planned to officially enter the Star Film Company, but it did not work out for other reasons.</p>
<p>The boring things like female stars unveiling for others are becoming less and less now.</p>
<p>Zhang Wen, a newcomer from Yi Hua, played a boat girl in "At the Beginning of Man" (this is what I learned from the publicity draft), and a nurse in "The Tempest". Probably to promote newcomers, Yi Hua also specifically issued a "Newcomer Zhang Wen" publicity draft.</p>
<p>What I saw was a fleeting glimpse in "At the Beginning of Man", and I didn't even see her face clearly. In "The Tempest", she had more scenes than in "At the Beginning of Man". This time, people can see her face clearly (but if it weren't for the instructions in the manual, I'm afraid I still wouldn't be able to see it)?</p>
<p>Therefore, I understand the meaning of the four words "promote newcomers" and the function of the instruction manual.</p>
<h3>African War Premieres</h3>
<p>At this critical moment of the treacherous Italian-Abyssinian situation, "African War" is something that we should pay great attention to. This film is a famous adventure novel by British literary master Edgar Wallace, which describes all kinds of inevitable human tragedies. However, the plot is very tragic and lingering, and the natural background is great and beautiful. The protagonist is the black genius superstar Paul Robeson (Paul Robeson will star in "The Emperor Jones", that is, "The Emperor Jones"). A contribution from the authoritative American Lianmei Company in the film industry, now showing in "Nanjing".</p>
<h3>Golden City Premieres "The Tempest"</h3>
<p>Yi Hua Company's latest masterpiece, directed by Yuan Congmei, starring Yuan Meiyun, Wei Heling, Wang Naidong, Cang Yinqiu, Qin Tong, Liu Zhao, etc., photography by Wu Weiyun, scenery by Fang Feilin, and all-sound singing and dancing dialogue silver film by Gu Zongyi, "The Tempest", will be premiered at the Golden City Theater on the 2nd. The characteristics of this film are not only that the director is good, the photography is good, the scenery is good, the sound is good, and the actors are good, but especially the three major problems of "life", "society" and "era" hinted in the play have bold, accurate and profound positive reviews and sideways irony. It tells you the sins and contradictions of life in the society of the current era, and also tells you how people should struggle and work hard in the society of the current era. Therefore, it can be said that it is a work that deals with the personal problems of the hard-pressed people in the current era. Men and women who are struggling in the current society all need to learn from this play the current way out and the need to improve their lifestyle.</p>
